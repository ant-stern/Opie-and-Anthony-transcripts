<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a humorous, morbid hypothetical about a rage-inducing virus, followed by a critical discussion of Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton's potential presidential candidacies.  A significant portion focuses on the "Voyeur Bus" incident, the unavailability of related videos on YouTube due to nudity, and Buffalo Paul's YouTube account suspension for uploading them.  They discuss other YouTube content, including "Assault on the Media" videos, and listener suggestions for alternative platforms.  Upcoming segments, including the "Homeless Shopping Spree," the controversial "Feels for Meals," and "Money Snatch," are promoted.  Mike Rowe and Chyna (China Doll) are announced as guests.  A debate ensues regarding a 10-year-old boy suspended for calling his teacher "sexy," leading to a discussion on zero-tolerance policies and listener experiences with school disciplinary actions, including racial slurs; a teacher then calls in with a similar experience.

The show continues with a discussion about the N-word and acceptable language, transitioning to listener calls about incidents at school, including a seven-year-old's suspension for lifting a girl's shirt and a uniform adjustment dispute.  A news report on a neo-Nazi protest in Austin sparks a debate on freedom of speech and media bias, leading to a discussion on "white" versus "black" cinema and Black History Month.  Further listener calls detail inappropriate touching at school and a teacher's inappropriate behavior in a Catholic school.  Humorous bits include a fake news segment parodying sensationalized reporting (a paralyzed woman and tainted carrot juice),  Quincy impersonations, and a running "fuck" euphemism gag.  Listener calls cover a husband's sleep apnea affecting their sex life and potential infidelity.  The show again promotes Mike Rowe and Chyna as guests, announcing a video contest.  Mike Rowe's in-studio appearance details his experiences with particularly dirty jobs, including hospital ductwork, abandoned oil tanks, and sewage treatment plants.

With Mike Rowe as a guest, the hosts reminisce about Anthony's past life and his new Shelby GT500, discussing lifestyle changes.  Listeners share anecdotes about unpleasant jobs: termite inspections in funeral homes, crime scene cleanup with graphic descriptions of decaying corpses and animal scavenging. Rowe shares his experiences, including a roadkill cleanup with a cat attack. A caller mentions Rowe's previous show with Malou Nubla, prompting discussion about their careers and past jobs.  Chyna joins the show, detailing a violent relationship with X-Pac, including physical abuse and the unauthorized production of "One Night in China." She discusses the public breakup's impact, with sexually explicit comments from the hosts and Chyna about her body and sexual preferences. The segment concludes with further discussion of Chyna's experiences and relationship with X-Pac, punctuated by sexually suggestive comments and jokes. Jimmy Norton expresses strong attraction to Chyna, leading to a physical interaction after the broadcast.  The show promotes an *FHM* feature and the "homeless shopping spree."

Opie discusses Cialis, transitioning to a rant about eBay scalpers using highly offensive language.  Jimmy Norton shares his breakup and depression, interspersed with boasts about sexual encounters.  The conversation shifts to Mike Rowe's *Dirty Jobs* experiences:  crab fishing on *Deadliest Catch* and a harrowing encounter with aggressive monkeys in South Africa, detailing injuries.  The hosts and Rowe discuss the inherent dangers of *Dirty Jobs*, with numerous crude jokes and offensive remarks, including misogynistic and homophobic slurs.  The conversation frequently returns to Jimmy Norton's breakup, with insensitive support and commentary. The segment ends with continued discussion of Mike Rowe's experiences and crude jokes.

The final segment features Mike Rowe discussing humorous anecdotes ("The Man in the Glass," "The Man in the Boat"), followed by a voicemail from Jim Norton's mother expressing concern about his lifestyle.  They discuss Jim's dating life with sexually explicit descriptions. Graphic descriptions of a craft services worker's weight and eating habits are included.  A news report about a woman's semen allergy leads to sexually explicit jokes and a listener call about a similar allergy with graphic descriptions of symptoms and treatment.  Mike Rowe shares stories from *Dirty Jobs*, including inseminating a sow and working at a skull-cleaning facility processing human skulls from China, detailing the flesh removal process. They play a "guess the sound" game involving a supposed Chinese execution.  The show promotes Mike Rowe's show and stand-up appearance. The "Line of the Day" is awarded to a caller's suggestive comment regarding STI testing.  Offensive language is frequent throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  It's coming through your windows. It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease, fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours? If it infects, replicates, and kills this cast, these numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  I said one. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves puffs fuels.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out.  Here we go.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty, like me. 
[00:01:00]  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, everything worked today?  Everything is on and ready to roll.  Rudy set to go.  Front page of the New York paper.  Look at that. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Setting up an exploratory commission.  Exploratory.  And they're already saying he would be in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton.  That's such a, that's such crap.  He would not.  He would do better than Hillary would even as a Republican.  No, I, Hillary's such a goof candidate.  No, I understand what's going on here though. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Dead heat as he, as, as it's day one for him.  Yeah, yeah.  He just steps in and already.  She's been, she's been kind of, I was hinting at it for, for a very long time.  So, of course.  Eight years.  Obama!  Yeah.  Good luck with that one.  You run with that.  He's in the other candidate category.  Well, Hillary and, uh.  Other candidates.  What?  They're actually pretty equally qualified.  I mean, he was only the mayor of New York for, what, eight years?  Yeah.  And, uh, she slept with a guy who, uh, cheated on her with everyone, including a fat chick. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  They both have kind of equal political clout as far as I'm concerned.  I know she's a senator.  Hillary's a very smart woman, Jimmy.  She certainly is.  A very smart woman.  She's done very little for New York.  She's an adult who, yeah, has done very little.  She doesn't hurt New York either.  What has she done?  Yeah, I know.  Nothing.  Video games.  Rudy cleaned the city up.  He, he, he did all that, all those little, those little crimes that everybody said, oh,  you shouldn't worry about that.  He cleaned all that up.  Yeah.  Made the city such a better place.  And she has just kind of showed up and just did nothing with fat calves. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I don't know what she's done.  What, what, what has Hillary done?  But you don't know what she hasn't done.  Yeah.  What hasn't she done?  You don't know what she's done, but you don't know what she hasn't done either.  She hadn't made sure her husband had his fly closed during certain evenings in the Oval  Office.  People are looking past that at this point.  Are they?  Wait till the election ads, wait till those filthy election ads come up if she's, you think  they're going to stop at that one?  She couldn't even keep track of her husband's affairs. 
[00:04:00]  Do you want her looking after yours?  I hope she's against Paul R. Nelson.  I'm sure he'd have some gems.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Well, if it's not Obama, it's not Hillary, then who is it?  It's Rudy.  How about a solution instead of beating everybody up?  Rudy, who do you want?  You really want Rudy to be the president of the United States?  Yeah.  As far as a Republican goes, the guy's a pretty moderate Republican.  Yeah.  As far as, he doesn't have this crazy religious right ideology. 
[00:04:30]  He's, he's pro-choice.  And the guy's kind of, kind of, he has that regular guy attitude.  You know, he knows what's good for, he knew what was good for, he knew what was  good for the city.  And even though a lot of stuff he did wasn't popular, he knew it was good to bring money  into the city and make the city a better place.  So he said, screw the polls, screw a lot of the people that are giving me crap and did  it anyway.  And how great would it be to have a president in the White House that we have tape of calling  us stupid? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.  Now, come on.  All right.  What president has ever called us stupid?  Good point.  You do forget that most of the city hated Rudy on September 10th.  September 10th, Rudy was a hated man.  For the most part.  September 10th, 2001, he was an idiot.  And then he became a hero.  I don't think the rest of America understands that.  Oh.  Most people in New York did not like Rudy Giuliani.  No.  Until that September 11th thing.  But you're right.  He did have a press conference for the Voyeur bus and he called us stupid. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, stupid.  It's stupid.  It's stupid.  They're stupid.  What do you think of the shock jocks that had a bus drive through it?  Stupid.  It's just stupid.  I'd love that.  Why aren't the Voyeur bus clips up on YouTube?  We don't have...  It should be.  YouTube, we have over 900 videos up on YouTube right now.  You're kidding me.  But we don't have any of the really good stuff from the old days.  It's mostly new stuff since we got back to radio. 
[00:06:00]  The Voyeur bus clips are amazing.  Really?  Or you can't really show nudity on YouTube, right?  Can you show a boobie on YouTube?  No.  They're pretty strict.  Nothing whatsoever?  They're pretty strict with that crap.  Can you cube it or no?  Can you pixelate?  Hey, I'll tell you right now.  If you can't show boobie on YouTube, this is a message for Buffalo Paul, who's a faithful  listener to this program, does a lot of good for this program, listens on XM, listens on  The Edge in Buffalo.  Get your TNA with ONA videos off YouTube, or you're going to lose all your videos, because 
[00:06:30]  that's how they work on YouTube.  That's how they ride on YouTube.  Maybe you should have wrote them on email.  Because I check pretty much every day the latest Opie and Anthony videos on YouTube.  Yeah.  And Paul, he just couldn't help himself anymore.  Good for him.  He's had gold in his hands for years, and he's like, ah, I gotta show somebody!  Gotta show it!  Gotta!  Good for him.  So I went, uh, you throw Opie and Anthony to search, and then you do, um, um, um, most 
[00:07:00]  added, and what, what, wait, view, and most recently added, or something like that.  I don't know how it works, and I don't care.  Why?  No, I don't know how any of the search things work.  Oh, it's really easy.  You put in the, I just, I just kind of browse around it on a daily basis and find the most  viewed of the day kind of thing.  Yeah.  And they're usually pretty boring.  Well, that's the problem.  It's a lot of chicks talking into a camera trying to be famous, and, uh, a lot of guys 
[00:07:30]  doing things that are supposedly outrageous, but are really just boring.  Eventually, it's just gonna just, uh, kill itself.  Yeah, yeah.  There's gonna be so many videos up there, it's not gonna be worth going there anymore.  Just garbage.  Because it's gonna be warded down with so many crappy videos, uh, the average person's  gonna be like, it's not worth going here.  You know, then, uh, another video, uh, uh, website will show up where they take the best  videos from the internet.  Yeah, that's, that's gonna be the next stage, obviously.  And someone's gonna have to, like, go through it.  Yeah, but, uh, program director. 
[00:08:00]  I think it's called Most Recently Viewed, so I, I, I check that every morning, you know,  when you throw Opie and Anthony in the search, and there, over the weekend, is Buffalo Paul's  TNA with ONA.  Wow.  Videos from Buffalo.  Girls just doing things.  That's wonderful.  Doing things that YouTube don't, uh, don't like.  No?  No, no, completely naked in the middle of a volleyball court with, uh, I don't know,  maybe a thousand of our listeners, uh, checking that part of the, uh, TNA with ONA thing.  Bet it's off now.  I hope so. 
[00:08:30]  Um, cause, I mean, what sucks about YouTube, if, if you're in violation, you're in violation!  Yes.  Uh, they take all your videos down.  They don't just take the one video down that you're in violation with.  They decide to just wipe out your account.  So you might be doing all this good for YouTube, you're throwing up hundreds of really cool videos  that people are really enjoying, and you make one lousy mistake, and YouTube just, just  deletes your account.  They have a one-strike-you're-out policy.  That's bad, though. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  They just don't want to get sued.  That's it.  They probably have that thing, we're not gonna get sued for anything.  They don't want to get sued.  They want to be legit, you know?  They want to, uh, make their, they want to lay down in bed there with Google.  Right.  With the Google.  Right, well, so the Voyabus, uh, videos can't be up there, I guess.  There's gotta be some of them that probably could, though, no?  There's a way.  That was an amazing day in the city.  Just an amazing day.  Cause it wasn't just the, uh, the boobage.  There's a lot of funny stuff going on.  That would be, uh, great to watch on YouTube. 
[00:09:30]  So, if, uh, any way to pixelate it or something like that.  I think they go for pixelated.  I think there's a news report up there on the Voyabus incident.  Yeah.  Where they do kind of, like, pixelate and, and make sure the boobies aren't, uh, uh, you  know, uh, aren't being seen.  But that's good enough for the news.  But that was, yeah, that was news.  So, that was just an amazing day.  Voyabus comes rolling into town.  We get, uh, teenage girls, legal teenage girls on the bus.  It's just a plexiglass bus.  You can see right through the damn thing and the showers and such. 
[00:10:00]  And they're just completely nude as, uh, we just tool, uh, around the city one day.  Bathing.  A few years back.  Talking.  We had thousands of people on the street just, uh, taking pictures.  Cop actually escorting the bus.  Cop escorting.  That was another no-no.  Eventually, what, 12 or 13 guys got arrested on that one?  Yeah.  Including our own old Jimmy Norris.  Jimmy spent some time in jail on that one.  I did.  That had to hurt.  But where we screwed up, we stopped in front of the mayor's thing there.  City Hall.  Yeah.  And the stupid CNN reporter jumps out to, to get his reaction on the Opie and Anthony 
[00:10:30]  Voyabus.  Oops.  Hence the stupid in the press conference.  Stupid.  Mm-hmm.  It did work out in the end, though.  In hindsight, it worked out, uh, relatively well.  The way it should have, but at the time.  Well, yeah.  I mean, stupid Louis Black.  And also, I smoked, too.  So, being in jail for 27 hours with a cigarette, man.  Ugh.  Couldn't smoke?  I, I can't tell you how.  Would the Negroes take away your cigarettes?  No, we ran out.  We had smoked a couple.  No, I'm sure they would have.  Well, perhaps you were traded for some kind of sexual favors. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  This is for all your cigarettes.  Is that normal when you get locked up for what is a misdemeanor to have to put on lipstick  and for one gentleman to have you go and do something with another gentleman and then  bring back cigarettes for your man?  Yeah.  Why do you always have to blame the Negro?  Why could it have been a Puerto Rican that stole a cigarette?  Or, like, a white guy on crystal meth?  Why does it always have to be the Negro?  I'll tell you why.  Because, uh, in the movies and on TV shows, it's, uh, stereotypical that it's usually a  big black guy in prison that, uh, works you over. 
[00:11:30]  Haven't you heard that?  It's usually the big, uh, black guy.  Why couldn't it have been a giant Hispanic gentleman who humiliated my mouth?  Oh, could have been.  If that's what you want, Jimmy.  If that's what you dream of.  Yeah.  Tall strapping guy with a tattoo on his left arm.  You know.  You know, come on.  Um, speaking of YouTube videos, the latest ones that went up there, No Filter Paul threw up  all his Assault on the Media video clips, which was just a great, great, um, promotion for 
[00:12:00]  this radio show.  Love to see some new ones of those.  That was taken, that was taken away from us, unfortunately.  But, uh, they're great.  Go to YouTube and check out the Assault on the Media videos.  They took away the Assault on the Media because I think we were, we began to sponsor it to  a certain degree, and that was kind of a no-no.  You can't, uh, encourage people to do such things.  And I, I would never encourage people to go out and do stuff like that, by the way, but  I'd laugh.  I would.  Here's my problem.  I'm really smart, but, but I'm always too late. 
[00:12:30]  What happened?  Buffalo Paul's user account has already been suspended.  Oh, it was?  And it wasn't because of what I was just saying, right?  It was already suspended before it went on the air to warn the guy.  To warn the guy!  That means we're gonna, he's gonna lose about a hundred, uh, at least a hundred videos.  Eh, I'll pop him back up under, uh, another name.  Another name or something?  How?  Is it an IP address banned?  I knew that, when I saw the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, da, da, da, da, da, da,  the TNA with, uh, ONA video clips on YouTube, I'm like, Buffalo Paul has lost his freaking 
[00:13:00]  mind.  Everyone knows you can't throw nudity on, uh, YouTube.  How do they find that so quickly?  Know what it is?  On YouTube, there's a little, uh, link where you could be a tattletale.  Ew!  Oh, so there's a little...  Every video, because they were trying to get my, um, my...  Uh, cake-smashing video off YouTube, but that was legal.  It was legal.  We didn't have to tape this.  What is it called?  In violation or inappropriate?  Like, there's a link that says if, you know, you could click on it, if you think the video 
[00:13:30]  is inappropriate, you could just go right to the, right to the, the boys at YouTube and  say, you know, check out this video.  I personally think it's inappropriate.  And they'll watch it.  Right.  And then they'll watch it.  Anything is inappropriate.  Well, and, yeah, obviously, but then, you know, then they have their own rules at YouTube.  And they're the judge and jury.  Yeah.  And mostly it's about nudity and copyright infringement.  But, uh, the, when I smashed, uh, Homeless Andrews cake, oh, you should see all the people  that were saying this is inappropriate.  This needs to be removed.  Well, I'm reporting this to the guys at YouTube.  And I just sat back and laughed going, ha ha, it ain't happening. 
[00:14:00]  This ain't inappropriate.  You know, obviously, but.  It's horrid.  Buffalo Paul's, Buffalo Paul's, uh, you know, TNA with ONA videos.  As soon as I saw him, I'm like, Paul, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Couldn't get yanked.  There you go.  Assault on the media things considered, uh, copyright or no?  Uh, probably not.  In general, assault on the media.  Is that copyright and stuff or no?  Oh, it depends on whose point of view it was.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Let's, uh.  Whichever camera it was or.  Yeah.  I would, uh, man, I'd love, I'd love, I would love to see more of those. 
[00:14:30]  We're allowed to play them if they happen, right?  We just can't encourage them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would do that.  Yeah.  And then we got somebody like, uh, Brian, uh, from Delaware online too.  This is the dumbest thing.  I hear this all the time.  Uh, Brian.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Brian.  What's your suggestion?  Well, I run across a thing called Porno 2.  Porno 2.  Right.  What's wrong with Porno 2?  Porno 2. 
[00:15:00]  If you think you're going to get the exposure.  Right.  Of a video that you're getting on YouTube on Porno 2, you're out of your mind.  Better off all?  Yeah.  That could go there.  It could go.  You could put all the T and A with O and A up on Porno 2.  But the fact that the matter is.  And they started to throw, uh, you know, a bunch of the crazier clips up on Porno 2.  But you're not going to get that exposure.  It's like, you know, it's like MySpace and then something else space.  Friendster.  Yeah.  Friendster.  One of those things.  Right.  Exactly.  You're getting billions of people on MySpace and a couple hundred thousand on Friendster 
[00:15:30]  and think, well, I could go there.  It's like iPod and then there's the Zeno or whatever the hell is being released today.  Well, that might not do too bad.  But it's still going to be the iPod.  Yeah.  iPod's got name recognition.  It's like, it's the old Xerox thing.  It's the name brand.  It doesn't matter what kind of MP3 player you have.  You call it an iPod.  Yeah, I put it on my iPod.  It's not an iPod.  You call it one.  Well, you know what would be a suggestion, a way to do some of this?  If you can get some of these better videos and have some of them shown and then at the 
[00:16:00]  end say, for the rest of this video, and then just click and have a link in it.  I don't know how you do that.  Do you think they allow that?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know either.  It's opianthony.com.  Because opianthony.com, you're better off there than you are on PornoTube.  Yeah.  All right, well.  PornoTube.  I like PornoTube.  I'll show you a pornoTube.  Also on YouTube, we got Master Poe was caught dancing in the office.  That clip is pretty good.  Caught.  We have...  Ladies and gentlemen.  The latest videos we got aren't that great.  Roll and review Stranger Than Fiction in front of the live studio audience. 
[00:16:30]  And Poke the Witch is up there, I think.  That should be available on the search in the very near future.  Poke the Witch.  Poke the Witch.  Poking Patty with our microphones.  What are those YouTube guys coming in?  I thought it was this week.  Yeah, we ought to get him in.  Maybe it's later on this week.  Like, they're already booked.  I think it might be later on this week.  Was that the new Windows version of the iPod that I'm seeing up there?  Yeah, that's the one they're releasing today. 
[00:17:00]  I forgot the name of it already.  Yeah, it's...  You don't forget iPod, but...  Nah, they've been promoting this for a long time, and I don't remember the name.  It's a Microsoft version, right?  Yeah, it's called the Zanu, or...  Is it MP3s?  It's...  Oh, the Zune.  Thank you.  The Zune.  Same thing, yeah.  Same thing as an iPod.  I have an MP3 player.  It's nice, but it's, like, metal and heavy, and it navigates...  It's very hard to navigate compared to an iPod.  Yeah.  Yeah.  iPod wins.  Yeah, iPod does win.  But iPod, they're a bunch of...  They're scumbags, too.  It's so hard to, like, integrate between this and that and that one. 
[00:17:30]  You can't, like, put it between two computers.  Yeah, that annoyed the crap out of me.  Why?  You go, and you try to put a song from your computer onto the iPod, and then it's got  to sync up, and you've got to reformat it, so you would lose all of what you have on your  iPod.  How about giving you two or three places you can put it, and then, you know, putting  something in the iPod which tracks it, so you can't have it in eight locations?  I figured it out.  I had to use a different computer.  I couldn't do it from Windows. 
[00:18:00]  I had to get my Mac and plug that in and put new songs on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, big pain in the ass, though.  All right, we're just getting warmed up here.  We've got lots to do on the fine program.  There's some stuff on Heather Mills here we live to get to on page six.  Oh, absolutely.  Front page of the paper, Beatles, Wife, Sex, and the Arms Dealer.  I bet it's Khashoggi.  Jesus.  Is that the Adnan Khashoggi thing?  Is he involved in that?  I don't know.  He was an arms dealer.  But it's not on my page six. 
[00:18:30]  Page six, I have Big One Day Sale.  That is just a joke waiting to happen.  Her and an arms dealer.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  It says, see page six.  Write it yourself.  Right?  And I open page six, and it's an ad.  Are you kidding, Jimmy?  The post is legendary for the page six column, which resides on a different page every day.  Look at me trying to explain it to Jimmy like it's logical. 
[00:19:00]  Page six is on page 14.  Why wouldn't they just put it on page six?  That would be easy.  It's called page six.  Why not just put it there every day?  Right.  Yeah, the gossip column in the New York Post is called page six, but it's never on page six.  No.  And that confused our old Jimmy Norton.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  We're going to continue, obviously.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.

[00:20:30]  him and get to know him.  What about Andrew?  We've got to find Andrew.  Is he invited?  We've got to find Andrew.  Yes, he would be the star of the Homeless Shopping Spree.  I want to go.  I earned a jacket.  I think more people would be excited to see Andrew from the cake stomping incident than  Tippi Tom this year.  You know how much money he would make?  People buy him stuff.  Oh, I know.  How much money he would make?  He's a star.  By the way, later today, Mike Rowe is in the studio.  And also, Joni.  Now, she's got to call herself China Doll.  Well, she's not allowed to use China, so she's decided, all right, China Doll. 
[00:21:00]  She's here at 830.  Really?  Is she doing the walkover?  We're doing somebody a favor.  They wanted her a lot earlier, and I'm like, look, we'll throw her at the end of the show  and we'll see what she has.  Jesus.  All right.  That's what you get today.  I mean, she's been nice to us over the years, so we'll see what she's up to.  Also, on the way, the eggnog drinking contest, Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  So, you know the holidays are coming when we have the eggnog drinking and puking contest.  There's a guy in here, and it just smells like eggnog and bile.  I can't wait, actually.  I can't wait for the eggnog drinking contest.  I don't give a crap.  We'll see if Pat Fominaki can pull it off after his upset loss last year to one of the professionals.  What was his name? 
[00:22:00]  Eric Badlands Booker.  Badlands Booker, professional eater.  Pat lost.  Pat, I technically beat him, but I mean, even though he won the contest on technicality,  what happened?  He puked first, but Pat drank more or something?  Well, what happened was, Pat set the record, whatever it is now, and then puked, and legally,  you know, Badlands still had his minute to get his shot down.  Yep.  And he puked, too. 
[00:22:30]  No, but because Pat puked, contest over.  Over.  Badlands never drank that final shot that would have tied the record.  It was a crazy thing that happened last year.  Pat actually set the record and lost the competition.  Once you puke, you're out.  And for the new listeners, man, it is a great, great show.  Oh, yeah.  It's all about, like, ten guys just puking their brains out all morning long.  And they all talk smack beforehand.  Yeah.  They're all talking like, ah, I'm confident.  I got this down.  And after, you'd be surprised, after, like, five shots, six shots, some of them are going 
[00:23:00]  kind of like, ah, this might be rougher than I thought.  And we had some big truck drivers in the competition last year.  Yeah.  And, ah, yeah, they went out early.  They really thought they could get a lot down.  And, nah, they were backing out 10, 12 shots in or whatever.  You have to drink that final shot this time.  That's what you have to.  You can't get that.  Well, we had the rules were, you know, you have a minute.  So, I mean, it's all strategy.  Pat messed up by doing it early.  You know, maybe wait until the last minute. 
[00:23:30]  Because at the end of the competition, you see these guys.  They're struggling to hold it in.  So, I think we just keep the rules as is because it was very interesting.  It was a strategy that he used.  He had the whole minute to do the shot.  So, he waited, waited, waited the entire time.  And Pat woofed.  Pat went early with his shot and then woofed.  Yeah.  Out.  It was great, Jimmy.  We don't need to change it.  Trust me.  It was great last year.  I think Badlands should have had to drink that final shot.  Then you would have had them both puking. 
[00:24:00]  And then you would have had to do something.  Well, but the reality is.  A puke off.  The reality is, when you puke, you're out.  That's the whole competition.  It can't be, all right, I puke now.  Let's see if you get your shot.  But you have to drink it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  It was great.  There's no reason to change it, to be totally honest with you.  I like it.  It was exciting.  They gave us a great competition last year.  And the videos were great.  And we can't wait to do it again this year.  I think we've got to get a huge, huge prize for the winner of the eggnog drinking contest  this year. 
[00:24:30]  Yep.  And then Feels for Meals.  I guess it's official.  Another year where we have to say we're not doing Feels for Meals.  Why?  Word came through?  I haven't heard anything.  Oh.  I haven't either.  Why don't we just do it?  I know CBS said no.  And then XM was trying to get it done for us.  And I don't know.  Something about prostitution again.  It's not prostitution.  It's not.  Let's just do it.  We're trying to raise money for the homeless.  Let's do it until someone makes us stop.  I completely agree. 
[00:25:00]  Let's just, let's start doing it.  Let's have the Feels for Meals over at XM.  Get the box.  But we want to do it in public.  That's what I mean.  They were talking about maybe getting it done at Hooters before they open.  Well, we do morning radio, so obviously they're not open for breakfast.  I say we do it right on the sidewalk.  Hooters for breakfast would be damn creepy.  Yeah.  Well, that was their way around it.  From Steve, working on it, but I didn't hear prostitution.  I'll check with Eric Logan. 
[00:25:30]  All right, so Steve's going to check with Logan and see where we're at.  With Feels for Meals.  We really, really want to do this.  We sort of did it one year in studio where a brother felt up a sister.  Yeah, that was nice.  But we want to do it where we have our listeners just lined up down the street with their donations,  wink, wink, to get a feel.  You know, and you got the girl in the box with two holes cut out.  So you reach in the box and you feel around. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  See what you can feel.  A hole in the back.  And a hole in the back for Jimmy.  What?  No, none of them.  Well, they wear bikinis, so.  Do they?  Or do they?  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  All right.  And we got to get Money Snatch done.  Yeah, that's another one.  Because it's the holiday season.  The Money Snatch game, really fast, is we know there's a lot of women out there.  They don't know how they're going to get their Christmas presents bought this year.  Times are tough.  Times are tough. 
[00:26:30]  They are.  You need money.  Maybe they're going through a separation or some kind of drug rehab or some kind of unemployment.  And they got the kitties.  And the kitties don't understand no presents on Christmas.  They just know it's Christmas and they want their toys.  And we know mommies out there that are desperate will pretty much do anything to get the money so they can get the Christmas gifts for Junior.  Yeah.  And Ant and I came up with Money Snatch.  Money Snatch.  It's great.  People. 
[00:27:00]  It's not like it hasn't been done in some way, shape, or form.  Well, your morning zoo has done it.  Usually your morning zoo does it.  They put you in a big booth.  Or bank vault.  Or a bank vault.  Sometimes the money's blown around in a big whirlwind.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Look.  Oh, it's all around me.  Oh, it's all around me.  Yo.  Yeah.  And you have to snatch the money out of the air.  You got to grab it as much as you can.  A lot of ones are in there.  But then there's fives and a couple of hundreds. 
[00:27:30]  But they make it look like a lot of money.  And the person walks out with a couple of fistfuls of ones.  We do it a little different.  Yeah.  Money Snatch.  Yeah.  First of all, we need desperate girls, not happy girls.  Very desperate girls that need money very badly.  They can use their hands to grab the money.  But they cannot leave with the money in their hands.  But where do they?  They've snatched the money up.  Okay.  They've snatched that money up with their hands by grabbing. 
[00:28:00]  And, you know, even on the ground.  You just pick it up off the ground.  As long as you're snatching up as much money as you can with your hands.  But then you have to leave with no money in your hands.  Yeah.  I think this year we allow them to, like, stick it on their sweaty bodies as well.  Oh, I don't think so.  No, because they might.  Because that can look pretty funny.  They might wear glue.  I liked the way it was the first time around.  Of course you did, you pervert.  They weren't wearing a stitch of clothing. 
[00:28:30]  So they had no pockets.  Oh, they had pockets.  Well, no material.  They had pockets.  Pants pockets to put it in.  But they had to then take the money out with them without holding it in their hands.  And, by the way, we forgot to mention that we all have leaf blowers.  Yeah.  So when a girl sees a crisp hundred in front of her and she's lunging towards it, you just blow it away from her.  Watch her almost start crying.  So you're saying basically that to walk away with the money, she might have to roll it up and, like, put it in her mouth? 
[00:29:00]  No, actually, well, she could probably roll it up.  It would probably be easy to carry, but, no, not in her mouth.  Oh, she can't do that?  She can't carry it in her hands or her mouth.  Or with her feet.  She can't carry it with her feet.  I think they can figure it out from there.  Really?  Absolutely.  You sicko.  She has to tuck it behind her ear.  Right.  All right, let's go to Jim in Pennsylvania.  Jim.  Hey, what is this?  Anthony actually going to blow up the show this time?  What are you talking about?  Well, Anthony's the one trying to push the old, you know, the Feels for Meals deal. 
[00:29:30]  Feels for Meals.  I'm saying we get refrigerator boxes, we put them right down on the street in front of XM,  and do it.  And do it.  By the way, little known fact, I've never blown up this radio show.  Thank you.  That's a folklore.  Lawyers and bosses.  That's a folklore.  Yeah, I say we just did it.  We were ready to leave Boston when we ended that run.  Yeah, please.  And I had nothing to do with the Sex for Sam thing. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, we needed it.  I didn't blow up the show with the Sex for Sam thing.  Although I was overly excited at the prospects of things that could have happened that day.  It was wonderful.  Great day for radio.  All right.  John in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey there, Jim.  What's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Hey, man.  Hey, you guys want to see a true underdog story?  Get me in that studio, and I'll take on everybody for that eggnog drinking contest.  Ah, we've heard this cockiness before, haven't we? 
[00:30:30]  Where are you from?  Jersey in Woodbridge.  Jersey.  How about we have John?  What can you drink a lot of?  Drink something.  Milk.  Milk's close to eggnog, obviously.  Yeah, me and my boys, we always do this drinking contest every year with milk.  We put fruit coloring in it, and so whoever throws up first throws up the nastiest color  of milk ever.  How about you come in and display what you can do?  And if we're impressed, we'll allow you in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[00:31:00]  There's only, I think, about 10 slots every year.  One is definitely Pat from Menaki.  Pat from Menaki, he's in every year, no matter what.  Even if he gets his stomach stapled and decides that he doesn't want to do it anymore, he'll  always be in the contest.  He's a legacy.  Is he thinking about doing that?  No, no.  Good.  Of course not.  I was just babbling.  Pat from Menaki, I'm taking it all.  All right, John, how about you come in with milk, food coloring, and let's see how much  you can drink.  And if you impress us, then we'll let you in on the contest. 
[00:31:30]  I hear you can't even drink a gallon of milk, though.  Get in there, man.  Take a bag.  Without woofing.  I've heard that.  Yeah.  That's an old wise tale.  I don't know.  I've never seen anyone do it.  I've seen a few attempts being made, but I've never seen anybody actually do it.  But what is it, a gallon of milk in a certain amount of time?  Because if you have a couple hours, of course you could drink a gallon.  A couple hours you could, but I mean, if you're sitting there and it's some kind of timed  event.  No, give me a half hour.  I'm good.  Half hour, gallon of milk.  Gallon of milk.  That's easy.  It's probably... 
[00:32:00]  That's easy.  What does it work out for, like...  That's not going to impress us as far as getting in the contest.  You've got to do it like a shot a second.  A shot a minute.  Give me 10 minutes.  Huh?  10 minutes?  10 minutes, really?  All right, hold on line.  We'll have you in and we'll see what you can do.  Make sure you bring the food coloring, though, okay?  Now everybody's calling for the egg-buck drinking contest.  Make it red.  By the way, E-Rock, as I speak here, he's throwing money snatch photos up on opianthony.com.  Ooh. 
[00:32:30]  I'm seeing some horrific sight.  Well, those girls are really needy.  Bending over and sweeping up money as they go and counting.  We sacrificed attractiveness for need.  The girls really needed money.  Well, you know, we sacrifice for the listeners.  Let's be honest here.  Yes, we do.  We could have had a real boring contest, but we would have had a great day.  Or we could have had a great contest.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  That is a mess. 
[00:33:00]  That is not right.  Remember how the studio just stunk, too?  That is not right.  That is not right.  And we've got this huge studio.  We could have some fun with this contest, man.  You've got to see the pictures.  Go to opianthony.com.  Give E-Rock a couple more minutes.  He's getting them up there right now, okay?  All right, so there's a few things to look forward to.  As the show moves forward in the next month, it's going to be a very, very busy month with  money snatch, hopefully feels for meals, eggnog drinking contest, and the homeless shopping 
[00:33:30]  spree is just going to be amazing.  Are they saying homeless shopping spree number six or oh six?  I think we've done maybe, this might be our fourth one.  Four.  I'm thinking about four.  All right, let's get into some stuff here.  This is just a dumb story.  A 10-year-old student suspended for hugging his teacher.  Now, that sounds adorable.  It certainly does.  Probably was in the backseat of the vehicle.  Yeah, it was off school grounds.  Also, in other news, a 10-year-old guy suspended from school after asking his teacher for a 
[00:34:00]  hug and calling her sexy.  This is a guest who's Tony Aiello has the story from Putnam Valley.  10-year-old Aaron says he's big into the...  All right, going into the story, I thought the schools are, you know, because I'm hearing  things about the schools.  You can't touch teachers anymore.  Teachers can't hug kids.  No.  Back in the day, you see a kid, he's having a rough day and stuff.  The teacher would give him a quick hug, like, it'll be okay, you know, blah, blah, blah,  right?  So when I heard about this story, I'm like, this is, you know, the school's just completely  out of control, not allowing any touching or anything to happen in the schools. 
[00:34:30]  Obviously, the kid's just an ass.  What are they calling his kids, calling his teacher sexy?  But he was 10.  At 10, you hear someone doing that, like your father hugging your mother.  Yeah, yeah.  You're sexy.  Hey, sexy.  You don't suspend a 10-year-old.  Well, let's see.  You show him the error of his ways.  You let him go through therapy like every other kid.  Let's see how the story is.  Did you find teacher sexy at 10?  Yes.  Huh?  Maybe not.  I don't know.  10?  Yeah.  I didn't know what sexy was at 10.  Definitely found teachers, a couple of my teachers, sexy at 10. 
[00:35:00]  At 10.  Didn't know what the hell, you know, you're supposed to do or anything about it.  I just knew by looking at it that there was something different about that teacher than  other teachers.  At 10, though?  Yeah.  What grade are you in in 10?  I have no idea.  Fourth grade?  Let's see.  Is that about right?  8, 9, 10.  Yeah.  Yeah.  About that.  Somewhere around there.  I didn't find my teacher sexy at 10.  They would, you know, wear those 70s stupid skirts and stuff.  No, man.  No.  It all started in junior high for me. 
[00:35:30]  I think I went through grammar school without even thinking that a teacher was sexy.  No.  No.  I found a couple of them like, well, you know, she's attractive in some weird way.  But I have no idea why.  But you knew why or you were just getting the feelings?  No.  I knew, like, because I had already been, like, making out with chicks at 10.  What?  When, like, down in the basement of this apartment complex in Central Islip, there was this girl. 
[00:36:00]  And we would go down there to make out.  And that was, like, yeah, when I was about 10.  So I knew, like, what that was all about.  Those, like, weird feelings.  So, yeah, you could see a 10-year-old saying that.  Hey, you're sexy.  Can I have a hug?  All right, let's see what this is about.  CBS 2's Tony Aiello has the story from Putnam Valley.  10-year-old Aaron says he's big into the J-E-T-S, not S-E-X.  His parents say he meant nothing inappropriate when he told his teacher at Putnam Valley Middle School she looked sexy. 
[00:36:30]  At the house, at home, the word sexy to us is beautiful and you look pretty today.  It's, you know, he's heard it on TV.  Just yesterday we heard it on three commercials.  I don't understand if she wanted to punish him.  I would understand if he did something of a sexual nature wrong.  But to say that someone is sexy, I mean, we hear it on the news.  We hear it all over the place with the celebrities and things of that nature. 
[00:37:00]  Blaming everybody.  Aaron was reprimanded for the sexy remark in September, then suspended last week when he asked the same teacher for a hug.  But I got scared when I got suspended.  Scared.  And the reason why I asked my teacher for a hug is just to wish her a good weekend.  Oh, just to wish her a good weekend.  That's how it starts.  God, I don't know.  What do you think?  Don't know.  He's 10 years old.  He's 10. 
[00:37:30]  10.  But asking for hugs from a teacher?  That's fine.  That's a way to not destroy a kid's sexuality.  You ask a woman for a hug and this paranoid, disgusting society boots him out of school.  Just shoots him down right there.  Yeah, believe me.  He'll be lopping a leg off and putting it into a suitcase like Henry Lee Lucas.  He couldn't get that hug.  He just wanted a hug.  You paranoid adults.  If you can't separate a 10-year-old asking for a hug from a 16-year-old high school student sexually assaulting a teacher in a broom closet, then we're finished. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, there is a line here.  This no tolerance policy with everything doesn't work.  There's a gray area here.  If this kid – and the teacher should know the kid, should have some kind of a little psychological profile on him to know if it's an innocent kid that really just does need a hug or if he's kind of weird.  You know, like the one they talk about in the teacher's lounge.  Yeah.  Hey, did you see that guy walking around with a pup tent all day long?  You know, that's like maybe they got to worry about him. 
[00:38:30]  But there's got to be some kind of gray area.  Here's why there's no tolerance policies because we're such faggots and we're so afraid of being – accused of being discriminatory that we don't ever want to – like, say, well, one kid, we understand why you did it, but we don't understand why the other kid did it.  When in life, that's the way it works.  That's why the – you know, if you step on somebody's foot by accident, you know that you're not going to get punched in the face like if you step on somebody's foot on purpose.  We all have a no tolerance policy for having our toes stepped on.  If someone does it, you knock their teeth out immediately. 
[00:39:00]  I like it, Jim.  I do, too, especially if it's at home and you told her that you wanted supper a certain way and she steps on your foot and dinner's cold.  That's right.  More domestic violence humor.  I'm still pissed off about what happened this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  You know how we can answer this, by the way?  We need a picture of the teacher.  Yeah, you're right.  We need a picture of the teacher.  That settles it right there.  You're right.  That would solve everything.  You're right.  If it's some kind of buxom, you know –  Looks like that blonde – what was her name?  Yeah.  The one from Florida.  La Favre. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  La Favre.  Wow.  Or if it looks like Nurse Ratched, then we know it's an innocent thing happening here.  No problem.  The teacher complained the boy was acting inappropriately.  Parents and older students are following the case closely.  Actually, I think it's all out of innocence.  Well, it depends which way the hug he asks for.  You know, it's a lot of ways to ask for a hug.  From behind.  I mean, if someone said that to me, and I was a teacher, I would do the same thing.  Today, the family sat down with Superintendent Gary Tutte, hoping to clear the air and Aaron's school record. 
[00:40:00]  The school district did grant Aaron's request to transfer to another class with a male teacher.  His parents say they have the name of a good lawyer, but they're holding off on any legal action.  They still hope to work things out.  In Putnam Valley, Tony Aiello, CBS 2 News.  Aaron's parents say they were upset and they weren't able to talk to the offended teacher directly today.  The superintendent agreed to set up a phone conference with all of the parties involved.  It's just an uptight team.  That's all it is.  You know what?  I've had enough of teachers, too. 
[00:40:30]  Some of you do your jobs, and some of you stink.  And this woman stinks.  Yeah.  She runs and says, are you trying to hug me?  Help!  How about just handling it, adult?  God almighty, he's 10.  Aren't they supposed to know this kind of thing, how to deal with situations like this, teachers?  Aren't they supposed to know?  It's not like making a big federal case out of the whole thing?  I think what they know is that there's no tolerance, and they've got to report all incidences.  At this point. 
[00:41:00]  Right, because there's no difference when any of these things happen from one to the other.  A little kid asks a girl for a hug.  There's no difference between that and sexually assaulting her.  No difference whatsoever.  Kids have gotten in trouble for using their lunch as a gun in the cafeteria.  Like they take a pretzel and point it at somebody and go bang, bang.  Absolutely.  And with their zero tolerance policy in school, he gets suspended as if he had some type of real weapon. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Using a – how many times, you know, growing up did you just do that?  You play guns or, you know, you just use something as a gun in school.  Now you get thrown out.  Maybe you get teachers who are a little better at making character judgments on individuals  and stop being such pussies as far as being terrified of being accused of being discriminatory  when you let one kid go because you know he's actually not a bad kid,  and you go after another one because you know he's a problem.  Yeah.  Stupid.  All right, let's say hi to Paul in Queens.  Paul, what's up? 
[00:42:00]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, well, you know what?  I think it's pretty innocent, too.  I mean, kids nowadays pick shit up.  Sorry.  Ah.  Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.  Sorry.  All right, kids pick things up.  Go ahead, Paul.  They pick things up pretty easily.  My seven-year-old cousin was in school, and some black kid pushed him,  and then he called him a smelly pirate hooker.  Your kid called another kid a smelly pirate hooker?  That's from Anchorman, right?  Yeah, at seven years old.  Oh, all right. 
[00:42:30]  That's kind of cute.  Yeah, why not?  All right, let's say hi to a teacher here before we take a break.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  Just going, actually, I'm a teacher, and it's a lot different now.  You know, growing up, the way it was, I guess maybe you were growing up or I was growing up,  10 years old is now like 13 years old.  I teach in sixth grade, and the things that these kids say, even at that age, which is 11, 12,  things are unbelievable.  And it's a very real and very scary threat, the idea of a kid hugging another, hugging a teacher, 
[00:43:00]  wanting a hug, because, you know, in this society, it's just, if a kid says something, that's it.  Especially as a teacher, your career is over.  There's no defending yourself.  You'll never get another job in the industry.  All right, I agree with that.  Yeah, so there's a paranoia out there, so the teachers, you know, they're protecting their own jobs.  That makes sense, but the suspension is ridiculous.  To suspend me, that's just the school board being a bunch of douches.  There's no reason to suspend them.  Just punch them in the mouth.  They'll tell you, straighten the kid out.  With a smack, a backhand. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, a newspaper rolled up right across his teeth, across his snout.  Get the homoerotic gym teacher to give him a spanking.  Right.  His shorts pulled up way too high.  You know, the gym teacher that really wanted to be in some kind of professional sport.  Of course, and look where he ended up.  Couldn't make it, so he has to be a gym teacher.  Are they the most bitter individuals on the face of this earth?  Absolutely.  The gym teacher.  They're awful.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue with this and some other things, including audio from Apollo 17 with the astronauts cursing. 
[00:44:00]  It's pretty funny.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't want kids to hear it.  This might be better on XM, but we'll try it over here as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you. 
[00:44:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:45:00]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Sherry, a teacher in New Jersey.  Sherry, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  I had a similar incident.  One of my students was kind of doing inappropriate things behind my back.  And I actually saw him doing it.  And I railroaded him into a confession.  Hello?  Yeah.  What inappropriate thing?  Well, a couple of times I was leaning over a desk and I was like, right, he was on the side of me. 
[00:45:30]  And he would kind of like pretend, he would look at his friends and be smiling and pretending to grab my ass.  Things like that.  Yeah, things, how old was he?  He was 12.  So what'd you do?  Why wouldn't you railroad the kid for that?  Well, you know what I did?  I actually brought him into my room.  See, this was going on for like a couple of weeks.  And I took him into my room.  There was nobody there.  And I sat him down.  And I just told him that I knew what he was doing, that other kids had told me what he was doing, even though they didn't. 
[00:46:00]  You know, and I, you know, I basically got a confession out of him and he was apologizing and I was just going on about, you know, it's sexual harassment and you could get into a lot of trouble.  And he was begging me not to call his parents.  Aren't you scared taking him in there alone that he might say that, like, you tried to make time with him or something?  I really wasn't worried.  Make time. 
[00:46:30]  Jesus.  I know, 1940s.  I was afraid his parents would get in their Edsel and drive over.  So wait, what did you do?  I'm an ass.  Wow.  So you sound like a snappy gal.  A hot dame.  What did you do with him?  He basically just, you know, apologized profusely.  Like, he just kept apologizing over and over again.  And he felt really bad and he never did it again.  I never called him parents.  Did you find it kind of hot that a kid was checking out your ass? 
[00:47:00]  What was that?  Did he kind of find it hot?  Did I find it hot?  Yeah.  Did he get a little tingle?  Not really.  Did he feel flattered?  Did he feel flattered?  Yeah, I guess that's the word I should have used.  Flattered?  I don't know.  I think he was making fun of the size of it.  Is it pretty?  Oh, wow.  Well, have a good morning.  Carrie in Pennsylvania.  Did she ever tell the parents or no?  I don't know.  She's got a fat ass.  We're done with her.  Carrie, what's up?  Morning, guys. 
[00:47:30]  Hey.  Um, my son was in fifth grade and I had gotten to work and I get a call that my boss at the  time says, oh, the school called.  Your son's in trouble.  The police are getting involved because he had called another kid.  The N-word.  Now.  Well, was he?  The kid was, yeah.  But I don't know any of this until I get home.  Wait, the kid was.  Oh, my God.  Why were the police getting involved?  Because it was racial. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  See, it's a hate crime.  How old's your kid?  Well, now he's 17.  At the time, he was only 12.  So, he's 12.  He calls another kid the N-word.  So, what happened was, long story, I find out that this kid turns around and I called him  Crackerhead.  So, my son says, oh, yeah, you stupid N.  Right.  So, I'd ask my boyfriend to come to school to help out, you know, to deal with this.  Oh, I'm not going there, blah, blah, blah, because he probably is and this, that and the  other thing. 
[00:48:30]  So, as I get to school in the morning, I walk into the principal's office and isn't the principal  black?  All right.  Well, what did the principal say?  He said, well, you know, we can't have this, blah, blah, blah.  This is racial.  You know, we're getting the police involved.  Ew.  Yeah, and I'm thinking...  You should have just walked in with a boombox playing some hip-hop with, like, that word  used 80 times in it and said, oh, what?  What?  Huh?  Well, if it was in response to the other guy saying something racial, well, then too  bad. 
[00:49:00]  That's what he gets.  Well, the other kid didn't get in trouble for calling him a Crackerhead.  Of course not.  And he didn't get suspended.  And as I'm sitting there thinking, well...  Well, Crackerhead just doesn't have the same power as the N-word.  No.  No.  I mean, you know, they just...  The black community just can't figure out, you know, a word for whitey that's really  going to bother us.  No.  Like, I've been called Cracker Cracker.  I've been called all that.  And I just laugh.  What's going to bug us?  Employed?  It just sounds silly. 
[00:49:30]  It just doesn't have the same power.  And society in general understands it doesn't have the same power.  Well, my son must have been standing there saying to him, oh, it's okay for you to call  each other that.  And I'm thinking, how much more trouble do we want to get in here?  Yeah, that whole situation's out of hand.  He got suspended for two days, and I had to go back in and...  All right.  Adults.  We're all adults here, and we got to sit here and say N.  The N-word. 
[00:50:00]  It's infuriating.  Especially when you're quoting something like that, and you're not using it to be nasty  or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not even calling anybody that.  That's always CBS's thing.  That's not...  They'll just dump out of it.  Yeah.  You're just using it in the context of a story.  It's something you got to sit there anyway.  Like you're friggin' six years old.  It's repugnant.  Really is.  Why would CBS buckle to that?  Unless it's being used gratuitously or viciously.  But if you're using it and you're quoting a story like that, where that... 
[00:50:30]  Why do we as adults have to say the N-word?  Yeah.  If a black guy calls up and says something that you don't like, and you throw that word  at him and call him that, that is malicious.  That's something they would have a problem with, and that's fine.  But if you're just using it, yeah, like this woman's telling the story, she should absolutely  be able to use the word.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Crackerhead's okay, but that's...  It's just...  We're like...  Stop.  Like, children.  Children.  We're all little children that can't take care of ourselves, so people have to tell 
[00:51:00]  us how we're supposed to act and what words we can use and not use.  Oh, it is just disgusting.  Just the fact that paper won't even print the word.  Like...  Yeah.  If it's being quoted, as a guy said, it's like, then don't use the quote if you can't  print it, if it's that bad.  And if you're going to banish a word like that, then banish it from everybody forever  and ever and all time.  That no one can ever, ever use it, and if they do, there's some type of criminal charge 
[00:51:30]  that has to be brought upon them.  That's the only way it'll work.  You can't have a double standard.  Eh.  Ridiculous.  Unacceptable on radio, but the company that owns this fine station, I'm sure their TV shows  have the N-word, they're not saying the N-word, during an episode of CSI or whatever show.  I don't know.  Do they say that on CSI?  I don't know.  I'm just throwing a TV show out there.  I'm sure it's on TV.  CSI. 
[00:52:00]  I'd throw it in CSI if I was a writer for that.  Why not?  Absolutely.  But completely unnecessarily.  Yeah.  I think that's what I mean.  Just totally like...  Maybe a doctor's last name.  Spell it with a one G and an E at the end, but you have to pronounce it that way.  Paging doctor...  Yes, I'm being called down to the lounge.  He's just a complete white guy. 
[00:52:30]  But nobody would...  They wouldn't talk to him properly.  They'd say, uh, paging doctor, get your ass down to the lounge now.  You're needed here.  You're needed in surgery.  Hurry up.  What do you think, doctor?  Well, my, um, diagnosis of this situation.  Let's get...  Ronit, he's a pro at this whole thing.  And, uh, when he and his wife renew their wedding vows, she would say, I certainly am a 
[00:53:00]  f*** lover.  That was a stretch, that one.  It certainly was.  All right.  The whole thing is a stretch.  I just got a nod.  The last one was a real stretch.  Father and son doctor team, I don't care which one you get me, just get me a f***.  Oh, f***.  Oh, God.  Just write it in. 
[00:53:30]  That would be great.  Yeah, you make a left on Elm Street and then turn right on f*** Avenue.  You know what it is?  Because he's a doctor, he makes so much money.  And they always have the brand newest products.  And everybody has to play, uh, has to play.  Yeah, what is it, uh, keeping up with the f***?  I wish I was f***, Rich.  Because he's got a lot of money being a doctor. 
[00:54:00]  Old new house.  House is working with doctor f***.  We got the NYPD on the phone.  Rob, what's up?  Rob.  That doctor fixed something.  Hey, who rigged this?  Rigged this.  Oh.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  How you doing?  How's everything?  Good.  Yeah, listen.  I'm on a job in the city of NYPD.  Using the work, the kids are saying, like, they're going to school.  You don't even have to bring the cops, right? 
[00:54:30]  I love how he says it.  He should, because it's...  He absolutely should.  Look, I understand he absolutely should.  But we're sitting here explaining why we can't possibly do it.  Listen, yesterday you guys were talking about midgets.  We have one in the city now, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they had it.  She was high.  She couldn't...  When you had to pass the physical to the police department, you had to jump over a four-foot wall.  Three times, she couldn't make it over the four-foot wall.  She was, like, five foot three.  And all of a sudden, when no one's around, she passes the physical. 
[00:55:00]  We did.  They probably brought a stepladder or something.  We heard this yesterday, I think.  Yeah, we heard it yesterday with someone that's actually under five foot.  You know, unfortunately, the NYPD had to lower their standards to get, you know, everybody a chance to be a police officer.  Yeah.  That's what you need, more short people.  That just amazes me.  Aren't there certain jobs that are just cut out for certain people?  Like cops, you want people that are pretty much in shape, can chase down a perp, rack a little head if they have to.  That should be one of the qualifications for the job. 
[00:55:30]  Not that, like, everyone wants to be a...  Hey, I want to be an astronaut.  Sorry, it just ain't going to work out.  You know, there are some jobs that some people shouldn't be able to do because of their physical stature or maybe a mental problem or what the hell else.  Just keep cops big.  Them and firemen.  Firemen's another one.  Big guys that if they get up and somebody's dying of smoke inhalation on the floor, they can bodily pick them up and carry them down the stairs. 
[00:56:00]  Not have to sit there and go, I need some help here.  This guy's too big.  Thank you.  And he's gone.  But everyone needs a chance these days.  Everyone needs a chance.  Let's go to Seth on Long Island.  Seth, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  You were talking about the N-word.  There was a Dave Chappelle show.  On Dave Chappelle's show, there was an episode. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, the N-family, I know.  Oh, yeah, the whole family.  Yeah, oh.  They flopped it all day.  They were white guys.  Yeah.  It was a whole family of white people, but that was their last name.  Really?  Yeah.  I never saw that.  I'm really glad I didn't make it into a bit on stage where I thought I ripped the Chappelle.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  All right, let's go to Al in Westchester.  Al, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This happened a few years ago.  My son was out in the school.  You know, one of the girls in the class, and he flipped up her shirt really quick. 
[00:57:00]  You know, like, waving it like.  And we got called at the school, and he got suspended.  We had to go to court and get a lawyer, and he was seven years old at the time.  That's a little odd, though, dude.  Yeah, I mean, I can see getting suspended for that.  You can't lift a girl's shirt on.  Why was he, where would he get this idea there, Al?  I don't know.  But the whole thing was, seven years old, he had to get a lawyer.  Then, not only was he suspended, after the court was over, we had to change schools. 
[00:57:30]  He had to go to a different school.  Wow.  He wasn't allowed back in that school.  Yeah, something like that is a little weird.  Maybe counseling.  Flipping girls' shirts up.  Yeah, I know you're trying to defend your son, but it's not like that's an epidemic in the schools.  Yeah, if you're flipping up girls' shirts, there's going to be problems later on.  Yeah.  Unless you nip that in the bud.  All right, Al, thanks for the story. 
[00:58:00]  Let's say hi to Chaz.  What's up, Chaz?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  My stepdaughter, when she was a freshman in high school last year, she had a teacher who wanted her to adjust her uniform.  She was going to Catholic school.  And her uniform, her blouse was just hanging out of her skirt.  It wasn't supposed to do that.  No, it wasn't.  No, so she was supposed to tug it in.  Well, he wanted her to tug it in, in the classroom, in front of all the other students. 
[00:58:30]  And she said to him, no, I'm not going to do that.  She said, I need to go to the girls' room to be able to do it.  He refused to let her do it.  And in return, she got some sort of, like, demerit or whatever the hell it was that they gave the kids.  Just for not tucking in, though?  I mean, why couldn't she just tuck in her shirt into a skirt?  Yeah, these parents are trying to defend their kids.  What's the big deal?  Tuck in the shirt in front of everybody.  She sounds like she's being a little bitchy.  It's not like they asked her to change in front of the class.  Pull down a skirt. 
[00:59:00]  She wanted to do it.  She was going to do it, but it required her to unzip her skirt in order to be able to do it  because of the way the skirt and the blouse fit or whatever.  I don't know all the details about that.  I bet you do.  Yeah, creepy teacher.  You know how that whole thing works.  So you're blaming the teacher.  Think this through.  So the teacher in front of a million witnesses is going to have your daughter unzip her skirt  so she can tuck her shirt in.  And that's not going to cause any problems with the teacher? 
[00:59:30]  It's not something that a 14-year-old girl should be doing in front of everybody.  But do you honestly think the teacher would have allowed her to unzip her skirt in front of a class?  That's the story.  No way.  Well, my wife went and checked into it.  Apparently the guy had a couple little other meetings with other students.  I don't know all the details behind it, but he was pretty much a creep to begin with. 
[01:00:00]  But she wasn't too thrilled with this guy in the first place.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Later, guys.  I wasn't there, but it just sounds a little weird.  Yeah.  We got an interesting...  That guy's at the point where his stepdaughter's now at the age where she brings her friends over and stuff,  and he's got to sit there and just go, oh, oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  It's weird when they hit nine, right?  I ain't never seen a demonstration like this.  Sightseeing around Austin turned into... 
[01:00:30]  Get in it!  Get in it!  A circuit, who tells us Coleman Buck he's in town visiting with his friends and wanted to see the Capitol.  It's just a joke, really.  I mean, it's...  You know, I don't know.  I don't know what to say about it.  He says, the joke.  Oh, Hitler!  The National Socialist Movement.  Word, Hitler!  Or the American Nazi Party, as they like to call themselves.  America, go home!  They're protesting, all 20 of them, immigration. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know what to do!  To make their point, they ripped a Mexican flag.  They spit on it.  They even stomped on it.  It's like all of America is our Alamo.  They are pouring over the walls, and they want to change our culture.  The neo-Nazi party says they're just promoting their own heritage and culture.  Everything pro-white in this country is now hate.  It wouldn't matter what we wore or what we say or what we do.  White people aren't allowed to have white student unions.  We're not allowed to have white history days. 
[01:01:30]  We can't have white entertainment TV.  Dressed like Hitler and wearing swastikas.  Well, you know what, guys?  Maybe you want to update the look a little bit.  Maybe if you have presented yourself in a little more reasonable fashion, if there's some real  issues there, yeah, maybe you want to dress differently.  Because there is a double standard, and a lot of people have presented it in a very, you know,  logical way.  The guys, if you're dressed in swastikas and dressed like Hitler, I think you're trying to 
[01:02:00]  get attention more so than get your point across.  Look, I understand, and I hate to play devil's advocate, but look, the black things are just  kind of a reaction to the fact that most TV is very white-oriented.  We're going to complain if white people aren't on TV enough.  My only problem is in places like these stupid video stores, when they have black cinema or  African-American, that's unnecessary.  What's the difference between a black people in a drama and white people in a drama?  I mean, that's kind of ludicrous, but Black History Month, come on.  We know why it's there. 
[01:02:30]  It's kind of a reaction.  Oh, we've just given it to them.  I know.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  But you don't need white history months and, you know, stop it.  Well, they're claiming they're not a hate group.  What do we want?  White power!  Members say all they're doing is expressing their freedom.  You may view it as...  I can't get past the...  How awful is she?  She's really horrible.  I thought she was the deaf reporter for a minute.  What do we want?  White power!  Members say all they're doing is expressing their freedom. 
[01:03:00]  You may view it as hate, but we don't view it as hate.  Their chants...  Save all rights!  Save all rights!  Save all rights!  Save all rights!  ...were overpowered by hundreds of counter-protesters.  And I want to punch them in the face.  That's what I want to do.  Fears of retaliation.  Exactly why DPS and APD were on guard.  They could be seen in the air, on rooftops, and...  All the way to the sidewalk, right there.  ...and masses on the ground. 
[01:03:30]  Their entire afternoon, keeping the two groups away from each other.  Nobody's listening to anybody.  And capital visitors safe.  You could say, amused.  By the way, the pad data on XM, they're naming this Ant's Friends.  Oh, really?  Is that what it says?  They've got to label all the segments for the XM users.  Ant's Friends?  It says Ant's Friends.  I assure you, I do not know these people.  Where are they, Texas?  I really don't know what went on during that clip, because the... 
[01:04:00]  Oh, is she annoying.  Isn't that a great country that lets those jackasses protest, though?  I mean...  Eh, let them.  Yeah.  20.  There were 20 of them.  20 of them standing there yapping.  But by the way, to the pukes at Columbia University,  that over...  Just another cesspool of just obsessive liberal ideology.  Whoever overran that speaker, the guy from the Minutemen, 
[01:04:30]  they wouldn't let him talk.  As repulsive as you might find his views,  that's what freedom of speech is.  Those guys, as jackass-y as they are, those 20 Nazis,  they got the right to say it if they're being peaceful about it.  And that's what colleges have lost,  is they have no ability to listen to unpopular speech anymore.  Speech! Speech!  Why don't I shut my fat mouth?  They will not.  Why?  You are absolutely right.  I know, but it's common sense.  Everybody knows it.  I'm just reiterating nonsensically.  Everyone knows it, but no one addresses it.  You're right. 
[01:05:00]  A lot of people, they hear stuff like that  and go, they shouldn't be allowed to march or talk or anything.  That's hate speech!  But that's the whole thing of what this country is based on.  What's wrong with saying you hate people, by the way?  As long as you're not inciting people to riot or scream something,  what's wrong with saying that you hate people?  You're allowed to say that.  It's not illegal to hate people.  It's just not nice.  And with that, we'll take a break.  We certainly will.  Hey, we got the retard host in the public access cooking show.  Oh, we heard him cooking chicken.  We got Uncle Willie's tickles. 
[01:05:30]  We still haven't done that.  We have China Doll coming in today.  You might remember her as China from the WWF, which is now the WWE.  Can't sue us.  And China's now known as China Doll.  An awful song by David Bowie, that was, by the way.  China Doll.  Is it true she tried to call herself, let's get ready to rumble?  Didn't pan out either.  Also, Mike Rowe with the film crew.  Film crew, excuse me, coming in.  I better take my nose strip off. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to be on the television.  From Dirty Jobs.  I guess they're filming something.  I don't know.  A little behind-the-scenes stuff.  Maybe behind-the-scenes stuff or a DVD.  E-Rock.  It's probably profiling E-Rock.  Dirty Jobs.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the ONA.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[01:06:30]  You can email Steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this s***.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mike Rowe is here.  He'll be joining the program in a few minutes. 
[01:07:00]  From Dirty Jobs, of course.  Also, China Doll at 8.30 this morning.  I can't get past that.  What?  Joanie, China Doll.  China?  China.  You know.  She's reinventing herself.  She can't use it.  Why?  Because she'll get sued by Vince, I guess.  But it's China.  What the hell are you going to do?  Was Vince going to sue me?  Funny if he did. 
[01:07:30]  That would be really funny.  Damn it.  I think he could.  Hey, we've got to finish up news teases from the other day.  Scary news teases.  One of our favorite bits.  We've got like three to go, and they're the best three, by the way.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.  It's a tactic your local news uses, everyone knows by now, to make you watch longer.  Makes you tune in.  If you're just watching your favorite sitcom or something like that, and then the news tease comes on.  Tune in at 10, and then they give you enough info to scare the crap out of you. 
[01:08:00]  What toy could kill your kid?  We'll tell you, I don't know, December 8th.  Yeah, oh, thanks.  Somewhere between now and December 8th, we'll tell you which toy will kill your kid.  I planned on Christmas shopping for the young lad.  Dude, now I don't know if what I get him is going to kill him.  But they're just out of control.  Wrap it up.  I think it used to really be a service to the people.  Now it's just used to make you watch longer.  That's all. 
[01:08:30]  Publicity stunting is what they're doing because the news is just an entertainment show just like everything else on television.  Let's not be fooled.  All right, we've got three news teases left.  The last one is the payoff.  Oh, it is.  It really is.  Great.  But first, we've got this one.  Every morning, millions drink it up.  Coming up, the popular breakfast drink that may have paralyzed a woman.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Millions drink it.  It's very popular.  Orange juice.  Paralyzed.  It's an orange juice.  I'll say coffee. 
[01:09:00]  Coffee?  It's popular.  True.  Morning.  Well, no.  It's got to be one of those, like, liquid breakfast drinks.  I think it's...  Ovaltine?  Ooh.  Ooh, maybe.  Tang!  More oval tea, Mom!  Whee!  Yeah, she wheels over to the fridge.  Sunny D?  Sunny D?  Oh, I hope that black boy from the commercial wasn't paralyzed. 
[01:09:30]  I liked him.  I like the Asian girl.  Oh, I don't know.  She was a little snippy.  But it just showed that boys and girls of all races and creeds enjoy Sunny D.  And drink it together.  They sure do.  The parent, whoever the parent is, loves when their child brings home a very diverse crowd  of friends.  That's what all friendships are.  It's a whole big rainbow of diversity peering into the fridge.  It's brilliant marketing.  Where's the Sunny D?  Actually, they didn't have a budget is what happened.  Instead of doing separate commercials. 
[01:10:00]  Sunny D for the black community.  You know, a hip-hop song.  They decide, ah, we only have this much money.  Let's throw them all together.  You know how, you know, your local burger joint, your local burger franchise has their  black commercial, and their Asian commercial, and their whitey commercial.  Things like that.  Sunny D just threw them all into one.  All into one.  Just showing that ethnic stereotypes, none of that stuff matters when you're all enjoying  a little Sunny D.  They're all around the fridge.  What do we got?  Some type of grape drink, milk. 
[01:10:30]  Milk that...  Hey, Sunny D!  Sunny D!  The yellow face, the brown face, the white face, they all light up equally at the prospect  of enjoying some Sunny D.  They have to tell one of them that there is Sunny D in there because she can't see so good.  It's never sunny for her.  No.  Thought she was squinting at the light in the fridge.  She wasn't. 
[01:11:00]  All right, we need the answer finally to this.  Every morning, millions drink it up.  Coming up, the popular breakfast drink that may have paralyzed a woman.  Methadone.  I'm going to go with some kind of Slim Fast, but I don't think it's Slim Fast, but it's  going to be one of those meal options or liquid meal things.  No, it's milk.  Milk.  That would be scary.  She had some and then dropped the gallon on her foot and fell and paralyzed herself. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, nothing to do with drinking it.  God, please make it lactate.  Please make it lactate.  Oh, wow, you don't like that stuff?  No, because I always drink it.  Jimmy drinks it every morning.  Jimmy.  Or maybe lactate paralyzed her because you can't get that stuff without it smelling sour.  God almighty, how cold does your refrigerator have to be for lactate to survive?  I don't know.  Hey, could you bring Pluto so I can put my lactate on it?  Lactate sucks.  I've had enough of lactate.  I'm just going to drink milk and then snort the whole time. 
[01:12:00]  All right, Danny, what is the answer to this scary news?  Yeah, I'm frightened.  Oh, well, this is actually about some tainted carrot juice.  Are you kidding me?  How many?  Wait, first of all, carrot juice?  Yeah, carrot juice is not a popular morning drink.  I understand some people have like carrot blended, like juiced into something else.  Carrot apple is terrific.  But let me tell you something.  It's not popular.  Stop it.  This is a perfect example of what the news does.  Yeah.  It's something people do drink in the morning, but not a lot of people. 
[01:12:30]  And it's tainted.  It's the wheatgrass crowd, man.  Yeah.  Man.  They're drinking the carrot juice, man.  Stop it.  I don't know anyone that drinks carrot juice.  No.  Kids enjoy it over their cereal.  Carrot juice.  It's the first thing you think of.  When you think popular morning drink.  Carrot juice.  I think carrot juice.  See, they had to say popular morning drink to get as many viewers as possible to watch the rest of the news.  If they said an obscure, rarely used drink ever, you'd be like, I don't care if they're paralyzed. 
[01:13:00]  If they said a morning drink for hippies, you know.  Yeah.  Ah, well.  Wait.  A woman was picked.  How did the wording on that one go?  How did the wording on that one go?  Now that you know what it is, listen to this line of crap.  Every morning, millions drink it up.  Coming up, the popular breakfast drink that may have paralyzed a woman.  Now how many words are in that, and how many words in, uh, apparently, tainted carrot juice paralyzed a woman?  Tainted carrot juice may have.  Okay.  Three words.  Yeah.  Tainted carrot juice. 
[01:13:30]  They stink the media.  Why are they getting paralyzed by the carrot juice there, Danny?  Do we know?  She forgot to grind it up, and she just drank it as a whole carrot, and it got lives in her spine.  She drank it sideways.  You mean you're supposed to blend it first?  She said as she blew into a straw.  Was it from the waist down or from the neck down?  What type of paralysis are we talking about here, son?  Well, I don't know, but apparently, uh, it was, the carrot juice was tainted with botulism. 
[01:14:00]  Oh.  She had an allergic reaction to it.  To botulism.  Oh.  So this could happen with anything.  Yeah, exactly.  You could get botulism from pretty much anything.  Carrot juice, you can get botulism?  Of course.  I didn't know that.  You can get botulism from anything, right?  But how do you know if carrot juice has botulism?  Now I'm all paranoid.  You don't, Jimmy.  You just don't.  Remember the Quincy episode where he was the investigator and he went to the stadium?  Because millions of people will be here, Sam.  And then his humble, erotic Asian friend who would always help him.  You're doing great Jack Klugman.  I do, because I do the teeth. 
[01:14:30]  You can't see it.  You do the face.  Yeah, you make the face.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  That's a ridiculous story.  His left hand would always go out like a claw.  And then Sam would rub his back with scented marmalades and oils.  And he wouldn't put anything between himself and Jack Klugman as he straddled him on the autopsy table.  I don't remember that episode.  They would tip the fat banker carcass onto the floor just so Quince could lay on the table.  And Sam could straddle it and give him a good scented oil back rub.  Come here, Sam. 
[01:15:00]  Sam, my back hurts.  I remember Quincy went to the stadium and found that it was this tainted water and he saved the day as always.  Tainted water?  Botulism?  Yes.  There you go.  Like the tainted carrot.  All right, we got to get to the third one.  That is ridiculous.  Here's the second scary news tease.  I'm frightened.  It's like saying Christopher Reeve got paralyzed from a carrot because someone dangled one in front of his horse.  It's not the carrot, idiot.  By the way, damn carrots. 
[01:15:30]  By the way, we're not getting a lot of scary news teases from the rest of the country.  All I hear over and over again is Ernie Anastas.  Is it just the New York thing?  From Fox 5 here in New York.  Ernie is a whore.  Oh, he's the worst.  His hair, though, if you like Frankie Valli.  Shouldn't he be singing to Henry Hill and his date?  Enough of Ernie Anastas, that stupid hairdo.  Enough with Ernie.  Enough with Ernie Anastas.  Absolutely.  Now, Danny, how do they get their scary news teases? 
[01:16:00]  I like that he has an ass in his name.  That he is.  Yes.  Well, you can email your scary news teases to Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Thank you.  And everyone knows how to spell foundry.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  You know, if I had a website, I would make the name a little easier for people to figure out.  I'm so sick of spelling foundry for the last 18 years.  I like when you get to the front page of foundry and it's just those caricatures.  You don't know what to click first?  You have no idea.  It's a section for us. 
[01:16:30]  There's one for NASA.  It's just a bunch of everything's on there.  Just what?  Is there a link on opianathaly.com?  Who knows?  I do believe so.  All right.  That's a little easier.  Opianathaly.com.  Just get your scary news teases to Danny so we don't have to listen to Ernie Anastas anymore.  Because I'm sure the next one's going to be Ernie.  Probably Ernie again.  Or his partner there.  Probably.  And a sleep disease that can kill.  You may have it and not even know it.  Tonight, new devices that may save lives.  I know what it is.  A sleep disease that can kill. 
[01:17:00]  It's a Zalziflian.  You may have it and not even know it.  Oh, that's that thing.  That's apnea.  Yeah.  Sleep apnea.  Yeah, that's all that is.  Why is it a mystery?  A sleep disease that can kill.  How about just sleep apnea?  Sleep apnea and what they're doing to help people with it.  You know what it is?  Because everybody knows about sleep apnea already.  So if they say that, people will just tune out.  Yeah.  Why, and I say it a lot, why does the news have special language privileges when they are as rating-driven and as tabloids as everybody else? 
[01:17:30]  That's why they do.  As tabloids.  Way to make a point, retard.  I put an S after tabloid.  Tabloid is this.  I don't know why no one takes me seriously.  Oh, look at this.  Buried Jubilee.  Thanks, Ken.  Oh, wow.  We got some.  I have a Buried Jubilee in front of me.  Hey, hey, hey.  Why don't I got a Buried Jubilee?  You didn't request one.  Oh, because I called it on the blueberries, right?  What about the blueberries?  Oh, yeah.  I called the season. 
[01:18:00]  Certainly did.  Blueberry season is over.  Of course.  Unless you want to, you know, spend $8 for like a quarter of a pint of what?  Oh, so.  Because they have to get them from guac-a-wac-guac.  Of what?  Blueberries.  Un-effable.  Yeah, another funny thing she said.  I hate her.  Oh.  What happened?  Sorry to bring that up.  That's all right.  Wait, what happened?  Nothing.  You're un-effable?  Oh, yeah.  All for free, at least. 
[01:18:30]  I'd be surprised how people put those prejudices aside for a couple hundred bucks last night.  Oh, my God.  Fuck.  No.  Were you in violation?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of all the three of God's rules at the same time.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You're just on nightly benders now with ladies?  I just, I hate myself.  Do you?  Yeah.  And girls come in, and maybe they're given gifts of cash, and they make you feel better 
[01:19:00]  or worse about yourself?  Um, the one last night, better to a certain degree because it was a good experience, worse  because it just came to that and whatever.  Wait, wait, wait.  That it had to come to that was...  So, how long do you feel better after this before you have to do it again to feel better?  Right at cleanup time, you start feeling badly again.  Yeah.  Once the, uh, you know how it is.  Once, you know, your body has to kind of, like, adjust for a while and you need your relaxation  period.  Once that relaxation period and the mania starts again, then it starts again. 
[01:19:30]  You ever get two in one night?  I've done three in a day.  I've spent over a thousand in a day before.  Three in a day?  Yeah, yeah.  It's very rare.  Like, like, one in the morning, maybe, or afternoon, and then early evening, and then  again, like, at, later at night.  Are you, are you guaranteed one a day?  Wow.  No, but I mean, um, I wasn't doing any when I was, you know.  Yeah, I understand.  But now, because that happened, is it going to be one a day for a while?  I don't, I don't know.  Why? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  Why wouldn't, instead of three, you do two, and then at the end of the night, it's late.  Why don't you just, like, you know.  I know.  Why don't I just do that and save myself?  Take care of business.  You save yourself some money.  You're done.  You're, you're relaxed, whatever it is.  Is it that you need that, the person there?  It's a drug.  It is, isn't it?  Of course it is.  It's just an, it's a, it's a, it's some type of addiction.  Oh, yeah.  And anything to not face the, the hardness of who you are and the vacuum that can be filled 
[01:20:30]  with love and God.  So is it not so much the sex, it's the company?  The whole thing.  It's the whole picture.  The whole package.  It's like gambling.  It's not just Gamsher.  It's not just, it's not just the roll of the dice.  Right.  It's getting to Vegas.  It's the smell of the casino.  It's, it's, it's everything that encompasses the, the losing, the winning.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole thing.  I mean, it's the people.  It's the picture.  The cash.  Yeah.  The chips.  Yeah.  Right.  Wow.  Let me try to make you happy.  You're smiling a little bit. 
[01:21:00]  See?  Made me happy.  A little bit.  A woman got zapped.  They tase her?  Yeah, they tase her as she's singing, obviously.  Sweet home Alabama.  All right.  So what's the answer to the sleep apnea?  It is, it is.  Yeah, that's obvious.  They got new devices.  What's the device?  They got some kind of mask where it's new?  Dad, where is that?  That's an Uncle Junior mask you have to wear over your face? 
[01:21:30]  It actually blows air in.  It helps you sleep.  You look like an ass, but I mean, you sleep better.  How does your mom handle that?  I always thought about that.  When you had to do crazy stuff like that to go to sleep and stuff, if your partner gets  turned off and all that.  You mean when she wakes up and realizes she's sleeping with someone dressed for an anthrax  attack?  Right.  I mean, it might take, I'm assuming it takes the sexiness out of a relationship.  Yeah, the fact that my father is dressed like a Kurd right after Saddam hit them.  Probably that or his awful snoring, though, which I imagine was even louder than this. 
[01:22:00]  Because I've heard my father snore, actually, since they've been down by Atlantic City.  I've caught it a few times.  Really?  Oh, no, okay.  That's just a car spit out.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's something I've thought about over the years, you know, when you're in love  with somebody and something happens and now your significant other has to poop into a  bag or something.  You know, does that take the sexiness out of a relationship?  Or do you try to hang in there for a while? 
[01:22:30]  What?  That doesn't add to it.  No, I understand that, but like, you know what?  You've got an old bag.  You meet a model, and then three weeks after you get married, when you're 23, she's involved  in a head-on collision with a gas truck, and the next thing you know, she's wearing a bag  and, you know...  And a wig.  Yeah, she looks like Robert Anglin, and she has like the long, a skew wig.  I can't believe she was a model now.  She's a BV.  A BV.  A BV.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The old BV.  Oh, no. 
[01:23:00]  The perpetual all lips.  What happened?  Oh, no.  You can't leave right away because you don't want to be like a creep.  You've got to stuff it out for a while.  Constantly looks like she did when that truck was coming right at her.  Just eyes agape.  Here's what you do when someone has a horrific accident like that.  You've got to tough it out through their hospital stay, and then the first thing they do wrong,  you use as an excuse to end the relationship.  Like, I told you to stack the VCR tapes properly.  Pick up all your medication and get out.  Pick up your salve-covered cloths and get out of here. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Pick up your soothing salve-covered towels and beat it.  Ah, yeah.  I've got to fill out a change of address for the FedEx truck that brings the gauze every day.  All right.  I told it would be boxes of gauze and salve.  You ready for the last scary news tease?  Yes.  And, of course, we're looking for news teases that we could enter into the News Tease Hall of Fame here. 
[01:24:00]  This might be good enough.  We'll have to decide.  Are you ready?  Let's go.  Here it is.  Living a lie and a double life, is your husband gay what you should look out for?  Is your husband gay?  Do we add that to the Hall of Fame?  I think so.  What you should look out for.  How about if he burps and it smells like bleach?  That would be an indicator. 
[01:24:30]  How about if you kiss him and there's tapioca on your face?  Wow, they're running out of things to scare us with, huh?  Wow.  They're going that route.  If you have no children, yet it looks like one was eating a fudgicle in your bed.  Just things you should look out for.  Yeah, you know.  Is your husband gay? 
[01:25:00]  Is this a big problem?  I, uh...  Danny?  I guess for some.  For some, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  I really do enjoy the really subtle things that you should look for.  Oh, okay.  Like if your husband reveals that he's a bisexual, that would be a clue.  Well, yeah.  Isn't that pretty much saying, yeah?  Well, yeah.  This is what was on their list of things to look for.  And if your husband goes to gay bars...  What?  All right, man.  This is the dumbest report ever. 
[01:25:30]  What other reason could he have for going to gay bars?  Sam.  Yeah.  There was botulism in the water, Sam.  They got good chicken wings at the gay bar.  Goddamn Quincy impression.  Just the left hand.  I love it.  He does the teeth and the hand.  Oh, I need a video of that.  Sam, bring your camera.  What else is on the left? 
[01:26:00]  Well, one more subtle thing you might want to look for...  Yeah, subtle.  ...is if your husband watches gay porno with other men.  Wow.  Are you kidding?  Did they actually have those?  As subtle little clues...  There's a whole...  There's like a little checklist.  Wow.  We got to see the checklist.  You really got to be a detective to uncover those subtle little clues.  I want to hear it.  Can we hear it?  I mean, I'd love to hear that.  I'd love to hear that report.  Yeah, please find the full story.  What wife actually went... 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my...  You're kidding.  I didn't know.  He's watching gay porno with his friends.  Why?  Problem?  Yes.  Now the ceiling looks like...  No.  ...lactites on it.  He might be gay.  No.  No.  They're just helping each other out.  He wouldn't be gay.  He says he's bisexual.  Oh.  When did he say that?  Before he went to the gay bar.  Oh.  Amy in Pennsylvania.  Amy.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:27:00]  My husband has that sleep apnea, and he wears this hose that forces air up through his nose  every night.  And how old is he?  Mrs. Vader.  How old is he?  He's in his 40s.  Okay.  And what do you have to say about that?  It really just...  I mean, the sex life just pretty much died at that point.  Oh, no.  See, we got to get into this someday.  The dumb things that is going on in your relationship that takes the sexiness out. 
[01:27:30]  And I don't want to go for the obvious ones.  Like, unfortunately, someone's paralyzed and all that.  It's this dumb stuff that the doctor thinks will help you.  And, yeah, you're sleeping great, but now you're not having any sex anymore.  Let me ask you a question, though.  Is she still here?  Yeah.  You said your sex life has died off.  But why don't you just have sex before he pushed the mask on?  How many people start having sex once you're actually half asleep on your back?  Is that when you would climb on when he's sitting there struggling for breath?  With his mask on. 
[01:28:00]  I'm going to explain it.  I'm going to explain it.  She's got that visual in her head now all the time.  Right?  All of a sudden, you see your husband as the guy with the goofy mask on at night.  And the hose kind of hangs over the bedpost and the machine's on the nightstand.  Yeah.  How do you think he feels with your tampons when he goes to the bathroom and he has to  open the cabinet and see a box of Tampax and he knows it's going to be a lovely weekend?  How do you think that makes him feel when you have your stupid period panties that you 
[01:28:30]  have to wear once?  The ones that you only yank out for that?  How do you think that makes him feel?  Oh, there are certain ones.  Oh, my God.  He won't even let me get stuff in the bathroom.  But you know what I'm saying?  You have your stuff.  How do you think he feels when he sees Summer's Eve and he wonders why the cats are no longer  walking around your room?  How old a gal are you?  I'm 32.  32.  And how old is he?  40?  He's in his 40s.  42.  All right.  Is he fat or is he drunk? 
[01:29:00]  Sometimes both.  Yeah?  Is he fat guy?  Yeah, he's big.  Yeah, see?  That's why the sex life is going.  Lose some frigging weight.  You won't have that apnea also.  Thank you, Amy.  Thanks.  Yeah, but we should get into that.  There's got to be those dumb things.  Not the obvious ones, but.  All right.  We got Mike Rowe here.  We got to take a break.  Get him in with the camera crew and China Doll at 830.  Ooh.  And China Girl is a David Bowie song.  Someone corrected us.  No one will know when you say China Doll. 
[01:29:30]  No one will know who's coming on the show.  Yeah, it's China from the WWF.  Go ahead, Sue Anthony.  Remember?  And at this point, they don't even know China from the WWF.  Remember China from WWF?  I like her, though, because I love the porn video.  He rock knows.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember I enjoyed what she had.  Are there any taboo subjects that any publicist tell us not to talk about that?  No, no.  Yeah.  Oh.  We'll have some fun with her, I guess.  She's been cool over the years.  We'll see what she's up to.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

[01:31:30]  Why is Eddie filming us?  Well, Dirty Jobs has come to that point in its life where we'll put virtually anything  on the air.  And that's just where we come in.  Wait a minute.  Are you trying to say we do a dirty job?  I'm trying to say that, you know, we got camera, we got tape, neither one's expensive.  Somebody shoots something, you know.  Just keep shooting.  You never know what the hell you're going to get.  Anything can happen.  You're right.  You want something crazy for TV?  Yeah, sure.  What do you have?  Something dirty.  I don't know. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  There's got to be some old dried spit on these microphones.  Maybe, you know, somebody could clean it.  Oh, great.  Somebody has to clean it.  You had to say that, Mike.  That's true.  Late at night when no one's here, there's probably some poor schlub who crawls in here  with a handy wife.  You know what?  Just wipes out old spit.  Yeah.  I actually got something.  You do the show Dirty Jobs, which I love.  Thanks.  Anthony doesn't like messy things.  And the question I got today is, what is the dirtiest thing you would do? 
[01:32:30]  I know in the old days you got plenty dirty.  Yeah.  Because dirty didn't bother me.  I would crawl through.  The worst thing I ever had to do, and this is something that I think I could have gotten  like ill from, is crawling around in duct work in a hospital.  That's bad.  Where it was, I mean, the fuzz was on the inside of the ducts, a good three inches thick.  Yeah.  And I'd have to take this down and just stuff would fall out of it.  And you don't know what, it could have been a TB ward that it was connected to or something. 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  But that was really probably the most disgusting thing I ever had to do.  Hospital duct work.  Yeah.  It's the stuff you don't know.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, really, it's like a Petri dish.  And we've done some work in hospitals, too.  And it's, you know, I mean, you look at the insulation, and it's bad, and it's full of  fiberglass, and you know you're going to itch for a week anyway.  But when you start thinking about the diphtheria, the whooping cough, you know, the typhus, all  of that stuff is in there.  And it's, you know.  Yeah, those bathroom vents you see in hospital bathrooms. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  What do you think?  They just go into the ceiling?  Yeah.  They go into ducts, and those go into bigger ducts, and they go to an exhaust on the roof.  And you're the guy that has to, like, fix this or add a new one to the old one.  So now you're cutting a hole in this giant duct full of fuzzy waste from people's bathrooms  that have been there for, I mean, you know, decades of buildup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you'll love this.  Yesterday, you know, we're up here shooting as well as doing, you know, the normal routine. 
[01:34:00]  And we go to Trenton.  We get this call from, it's an environmental cleanup company.  Nothing to do with a hospital.  To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what it was going to be because we never really know.  And it's this old abandoned building.  And in front of the building is this little pipe.  And I'm thinking, what can this possibly be?  Well, underneath in New Jersey, there are, like, 70,000 oil tanks, okay, that hold old  heating oil.  And this one is about 5,000, 6,000 gallons.  It's been buried for 30 years, and it's three-quarters full.  And it's been sitting there like a time bomb. 
[01:34:30]  These guys dig this thing up, carve a hole in the top of the steel, go in up to their waist  in oil, suck all the oil out, then drag the old drum out of the earth, then cut it up  and haul it off.  And by the end of the day, I mean, it's just unspeakable.  You look and smell like something not in your own species, you know?  Yeah.  And, you know, they're just kind of whistling and cracking jokes.  It's the only way you get through that.  Yeah, it's just hell.  And that just reminded me of another thing that I had to do when I was in the wonderful 
[01:35:00]  world of air conditioning, heating, and ventilation work.  There was a mansion, North Shore, Long Island, that was being gutted and renovated into some  type of big tourist attraction.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember that place.  Yeah, big place.  I did the work on that.  Okay.  Had to go into the crawl spaces between, like, the basement and the house itself was this 
[01:35:30]  heating crawl area, dirt floor.  It was like old catacombs.  Rats?  And pull out rats, big rats.  What do you mean you pulled them out alive?  No, we had to pull out these heating coils from these big furnaces, and they were made  out of cast iron.  Yeah.  And you couldn't get them out.  They were put in there before the house was built.  They built around it.  Yeah.  So we had to bust them up on our bellies, swinging sledgehammers to break cast iron and get whatever's 
[01:36:00]  in them and all the old soot that would be in there would just cover you.  I had no idea.  Oh.  You've paid your dues, dude.  Oh, man.  Because that's...  Some of the worst jobs ever.  No, I know that job.  Okay, I got one for you.  Hurricane Barrier Cleaner.  It's another one of these things.  What?  Okay.  A month ago, I go to Stamford, Connecticut, right?  And I don't know if you've ever been up there.  They've got this harbor.  It's all very civilized and very nice.  But at the lip of the harbor, the opposing sides of the land kind of come together. 
[01:36:30]  It's about 50 feet apart.  Well, on the floor of the ocean sits this giant hunk of steel.  Picture the cover of a book that's closed, all right?  And if you very slowly open the cover, that's the way the hurricane barrier stands up.  So it's perpendicular to the ocean floor.  And it's about four feet wide.  It's about 60 feet tall.  And every five years, the Army Corps of Engineers has to clean this thing.  Why do they have to clean it?  Because the interior of it is a series of catacombs. 
[01:37:00]  Each steel cell is about six by six, okay?  And there may be 200 of them in there.  And inside of each one of these catacombs is a zinc anode.  And the anodes are there to create a small electrical charge which draws the salt water to it,  thereby eroding the anode and not the hurricane barrier itself.  Horrible, ridiculous, scientifically obtuse job, right?  So divers swarm all over these things replacing anodes. 
[01:37:30]  I go through a manhole cover in the top of the hurricane barrier and descend literally to the seventh level of hell  with the sweet little park ranger named Diane who is covered with muck and mire and dead fish and sediment.  And it is so unspeakably bad because you're surrounded by steel.  It's hot.  You're up to your waist in this stuff that surely must be toxic.  It's been in there for five years.  And, again, they're whistling while they work, you know, just pulling all of this stuff out, dead fish, starfish, dolphin, whatever. 
[01:38:00]  Everything swims into this thing and dies so that people in Stanford can be protected at high tide.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Who the hell knew that was going on?  Who knew?  You know, who knew?  That's what Dirty Jobs has become.  It's not just, oh, my God, that's kind of bad.  Maybe I'll put my hand in it.  It's like, who in the hell knew that you have to squeeze the poo out of a 24-hour-old baby chicken  to look at its butt to see what sex it is before you can sell it?  No one knows these things, but it's happening.  It's critical, Opie.  You know, you can't mess around with your chickens. 
[01:38:30]  That's great.  Jimmy tried to go to the hospital and find out what regular children were.  Same technique.  That's a boy.  What's the most obscure job you've come across?  The most obscure?  Like, just no clue this was going on.  Yeah, I mean, chick-sexing was a big one.  It was right up there.  Anything worse?  You know, worse, good, bad, favorite, and least favorite have all become interchangeable. 
[01:39:00]  You know, they've all lost their meaning.  It reaches a point of they're all just disgusting.  Well, good is bad and bad is good for our show.  You know, I mean, replacing a lift pump.  Well, the short answer is we've done 125 jobs, and there are basically three categories.  There's dangerous dirty, there's obscure dirty, and there's poo-related.  Now, poo-related has become, you know, and animal-related, I suppose, but you can't have an animal without poo.  So it's a terrible...  Circle of life, they call it.  It's actually a circle of feces, but let's not split hairs. 
[01:39:30]  The thing is, I would say replacing a lift pump in a wastewater treatment plant has got to be...  A lift pump is four tons.  It resides at the bottom of a five-story shaft.  When the lift pump breaks, the shaft fills with raw sewage.  The men who replace the pump need to get to the top of the pump through the bottom of the shaft.  So they literally crawl their way through just an unspeakable and disappointing series of fluids.  How do they find their way? 
[01:40:00]  By feel, mainly.  If I may bring up another great moment in tin-knocking history.  I had to install ventilation duct at a sewage treatment plant over the muck tank, I guess you'd call it.  There's various stages that the sewage goes through.  Comes in, and it's pretty liquidy when it comes in, and then they separate the liquid from the real solid stuff.  And the solid stuff is thick.  It looks like chocolate cake mix. 
[01:40:30]  Lovely.  It doesn't taste like that at all.  No.  No, I wouldn't guess it would.  I never took a slice and tried it.  I never did intentionally either, but it happens.  It does get flung around.  It can get flung around.  Then there's the different tanks that it goes along and gets more and more purified as it goes.  But even in the last one, before it goes to some underground secret place where it really gets purified, a lot of this is done outside. 
[01:41:00]  There's tanks with these skimmers on top that just are constantly spinning around, and any stuff that floats to the top gets spun off.  And that's where you see, like, oh, there's a condom.  There's a tampon.  And, of course, the ever-present, always-floating corn.  Yes, the corn.  I swear to you, it is amazing how much corn is just floating on the top of these things.  I have never met a creature with a colon capable of handling corn. 
[01:41:30]  No.  It is remarkable.  Isn't it an amazing kernel?  Yeah.  You don't know what to say.  One word about the device you're describing.  It's an aeration chamber, essentially.  And at a glance, it wouldn't strike you as remarkable, but the final step in processing the poo involves pumping tons and tons of O2 into the bottom.  It looks like a giant, a huge, bigger-than-olympic-sized swimming pool, and it's just a bubbling mess.  It's almost inviting in sort of a concluding jacuzzi way. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, at a glance, you could look at this thing and go, you know what?  I could sit in there and be very, very comfortable.  But here's the thing.  There's so much air in it.  If you fall in, you will immediately perish.  No buoyancy.  Because you cannot tread water.  They can throw you.  That's why they have life preservers all around it.  It still doesn't matter because it would be like jumping into air.  Except it's so full of moisture, you will drown.  But you will sink to the bottom.  You will fall to the bottom just as quickly as if you jump out the window right here. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, you can't swim in it.  And every year, every couple years or so, you read these stories about the old...  Someone goes...  What happened to Frank?  Oh, Frank.  Oh, yeah.  Filter, aeration chamber, a hell of a thing.  By the way, this is Ant's old life.  Now, you know, if a little kid leaves a booger on his couch, he gets rid of the couch and throw it away.  But, Opie, you know, I've got to be honest.  Sitting here, watching him talk about it, there's a certain...  Certain nostalgia, what the French would call ennui, a vertschmaltz, almost, that, frankly, I'm going to call it a yearning. 
[01:43:00]  He's a lot different now, Mike.  Maybe not a yearning.  He's a lot different.  I dropped by the old place a couple weeks back to see some of the old crowd, the old crew I used to work with.  Bittersweet, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Well, I had just picked up a brand new sports car and I had to take it by.  I'm sure they'd love to see you.  Rub it in a little bit.  I had to rub it in.  You didn't want to say hi to anybody.  Someone look, I've made something of myself.  Smell my hand.  Damn you.  Not a callus on here. 
[01:43:30]  It smells like cologne.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a bunch of people you made sure saw that sports car.  I was just there to say hi to the guys.  Some of them still same guys, just knocking it out, man.  What'd you buy, by the way?  Oh, a GT500 Shelby, the Mustang.  That's nice.  I like that sort of thing, I suppose.  500.  What do you drive, my friend?  I'm sure it's...  I got myself a 98 Solera Toyota, maybe.  Ah, well.  Sure.  It's a city car.  It bears the whips and scorn. 
[01:44:00]  Of the...  I said it the other day, though.  I found myself just doing stupid things.  You think that you get a car like that, and you're old and mature enough to know that you're  just getting this.  It's something you wanted as a kid, but now you can get one.  Right.  I've earned it.  So I got one and earned it.  And you drive around really nice, and you don't realize you find yourself on a Friday  night going, vroom, vroom, next to somebody, and you're going, my God, I'm in my 40s. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  What am I doing?  Well, you're becoming the car you bought, and that's what we do.  See?  That's very good.  You know what?  Move into a high-rise, completely tricked out, and suddenly you're walking around like  Tony Randall.  You know, get yourself a modest flat downtown, and you know, whatever.  You know, that's what we do.  That's what happens on my stupid show.  You know, suddenly, you know, through no conscious effort, you're just kind of trying to fit in.  You know, whether you're wearing Tyvek or Teflon, you know, there you are, covered with 
[01:45:00]  poo and trying to make the best of it.  Elbow deep.  Hey, before we lose these two calls, I want to go to the phone.  Jeff in North Carolina.  Jeff, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I do termite inspections for a living, and last year, one of the guys that worked  with me, they were crawling underneath a funeral home where they do the embalming, and the  pipe was busted, and there was the goo and the blood from all the embalming they had done  that day.  Oh, wow. 
[01:45:30]  That's a good one.  Have you done anything like that, Mike?  Any funeral home stuff?  Well, we've done a lot of termite inspections.  I've been under a lot of houses.  Funeral homes, we shy away from for the reasons Jeff is describing.  You know, plus it's the description.  So we found something you will not do.  Well, I'd love to do it, but in the end, we're trying to do a show that fundamentally  makes you laugh, and it's just hard to imagine.  It's a little depressing.  Yeah, you know, when someone's pancreas slips out and hits you on the back of the neck,  it's tough to know what to say.  You've got to know your viewers.  Our audience would laugh at that, Mike. 
[01:46:00]  Our audience would giggle.  I guess we know the answer to this next question, then, but let's go to it anyway.  Fuzzy in Connecticut, what's up?  Yeah, like you said, this is kind of along the same lines, but one of the nastiest jobs  I think I've ever seen or heard of are the people who go in for, like, the crime scene  cleanup or the post-mortem cleanup, like a 40-day-old dead guy.  Oh, yeah, crime scene or somebody just died.  Yeah, well, I did a crime scene cleanup.  You know, Dirty Jobs came out of a show I used to do in San Francisco, a smaller version 
[01:46:30]  of it, and that's one of the first things we did.  And, I mean, it's as bad as you think.  It's actually worse, you know, because the thing about fluids is, you know, the ones we're  all walking around, left completely untreated, they will seep through virtually anything.  I mean, carpet, wood, concrete.  And just keep going, like alien blood in the alien movies.  Yeah.  And just keep going through deck to deck.  I did a job with a roadkill picker-upper a couple of years ago, and he worked with animal 
[01:47:00]  control.  And a lot of times when cops get called to go to a crime scene, animal control will go  in first.  And it doesn't have to be a crime scene.  It could just be, you know, death by misadventure, whatever.  Someone's died.  The smell has made it apparent.  Cops come.  Animal control comes first.  Because so many times there's a dog that's been left, you know, at the scene.  Now, the dog.  It's one of our favorite stories of all time, by the way.  When the old lady dies and then the dog has to eat, so it starts gnawing on the old lady's 
[01:47:30]  ankle.  It's an old, horrible story.  Do you know how many pig farmers die each year from being eaten by their pigs?  They have heart attacks while they're feeding them.  Oh, my God.  And then the pigs just food to them.  They fall face down in the mud.  Food to them.  And two days later, no.  Farmers go.  Wow.  It happens more than you want to know.  And it's really too grisly to articulate or show on TV. 
[01:48:00]  But you should know it happens.  Yeah.  Oops.  Because I don't want this kind of information to myself, you know.  I need to spread this.  It's easier to bear.  That's an embarrassing way to go.  It's a rough way to go.  It's a very clumsy and awkward way.  So animal control goes in first to get the dog out there?  Yeah.  Are they gnawing on the bodies?  Are they just...  Depends.  You know, it could be this guy.  I mean, the story he told was so horrific.  He went in with a young assistant, got two of the dogs under control.  The person had been dead for maybe a week and a half and had bloated to three, four times their size. 
[01:48:30]  And one cat on the other side of this woman was just insane.  And the guy reached to grab the cat.  The cat leaped up, grabbed his face.  He panicked and fell face first into the corpse.  The corpse exploded.  Okay.  I hear the corpse, that they do explode.  Sure.  They'll explode.  And basically, this is the guy's second, third day on the job.  You know, he's face down in a cadaver with a crazy cat clawing his face. 
[01:49:00]  And it's like, you know, you hear that story and you think, how in the world do you put that on the television?  And, of course, you can't.  You don't.  You think, how do you not?  Yeah.  You should show that.  Sam, get out of the body.  Fell into the body, Sam.  Oh, is that awful.  Bad day to me.  Wow.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Patrick in San Francisco.  Patrick, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, now.  Mike is trying to give you guys sort of a sob story, but this guy used to work or co-host 
[01:49:30]  a show with one of the most beautiful women in the world.  Not talking about Malou.  You know Malou, right, Mike?  Malou Nubla.  Had lunch with her three days ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a sweetheart.  Hey, listen.  And what insight do you have about her?  Malou Nubla is one of the hardest working women in TV.  She's Filipino.  She's a dear friend of mine.  She's smart.  She's funny.  And it's a national crime that she doesn't have her own show. 
[01:50:00]  What does she do now?  Is she on a show at all?  Tupperware parties for the most part.  No, she's freelancing, you know, doing her thing.  Evening Magazine was the show that we worked on together in San Francisco.  It had been on, like, 25 years, and most of the narcoleptic audience that hadn't died  already continued to watch after I was hired to see something called Somebody's Gotta Do  It, which was the thing we started that eventually led to Dirty Jobs. 
[01:50:30]  But Malou was the girl on the show who did, you know, like the feel-good stories, and she  was always bright and happy and sweet.  And I was just this dark, troubled, bitter, world-weary guy who just kind of showed up  late and got dirty.  So we were this weird Bay Area couple.  Nah.  The salad days.  I miss that.  Yeah.  See?  Again, look.  See, nostalgia.  You know what?  It kills me.  Look back.  See, we paid our dues differently, you know?  Yeah.  Anthony, I mean, you came up, you know, out of the sewers with the insulation, and now 
[01:51:00]  here you are, driving a beautiful car, living the life of Riley.  That's nice.  I started, you know, selling awful things on QVC in the middle of the night, but at least  in a climate-controlled environment, in a decent suit.  Yeah.  Went on to host a very cool show in the Bay Area with a beautiful woman, and now I'm crawling,  you know, upstream in a river of poo.  Yeah, now look.  Yeah.  It's a hard road.  You got to bring that back around.  I'm working on it. 
[01:51:30]  No more poo.  Let's go to Anthony in Philly.  Anthony!  Yoo-hoo, Whoopi and Anthony.  Hey, man.  Jimmy McBleach, Brad Norton.  How you doing, my friend?  This guy sounds hammered.  Listen, Mike, there's two things that disturb me very highly.  Tell me both of them.  One episode where you're changing a pump for, like, a city, you know, waste place.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And the guy that you're with has got his ponytail hanging out, cigarette in his mouth, and you 
[01:52:00]  guys are just spraying poo everywhere.  I remember.  Yeah.  It was great.  And one other thing.  Mike, don't ever wear a suit, man.  Well, what about a Tyvek suit?  Yeah, right.  Give me that.  All right.  With that, we got to take a break.  We got Chyna here.  Chyna Dahl.  You know Chyna?  I believe she's a wrestler.  She used to be.  You might not want to say that. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, I didn't know.  She might pile drive you if you say that.  Hmm.  Well, we do got the video camera today, so that could be fun.  Worst things have happened.  And Mike, you know, like, as I point.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Interesting.  We're going to have to ask her about that as well.  She certainly will.  Charades on radio.  It's the best ever.  I know.  The best ever.  This is why we're trying to pitch that as an entire show, but it's not really.  No one's biting.  Charades on radio.  Where we don't talk at all. 
[01:53:00]  It'd be so cool to promote.  It'll become obvious after the break.  See?  I know how to tease them.  Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM.  On sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opiananthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  There's been a lot of laughing during the break.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:53:30]  Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs in studio.  The chicks are digging Mike, man.  Yeah.  Girls dig you.  Look, yeah, I want to date you.  Mike is hot.  They're all these.  Because you're one of those, like, man's man kind of guys, you know?  Very kind, isn't it?  He's not that rough and tumble kind of guy.  And we were talking about how he could have been the guy on The Insider or Access Hollywood.  He didn't need to go this route with the Dirty Jobs.  He's telling horrific stories of everything, you know, that he's doing.  And it's like, dude, couldn't you just throw a suit on for a day and do da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, we're going to bring out our next celebrity.  And, you know, go home, cash your check.  But, no, you've got to be in it.  Mike Rowe, you're just trying to bring you the latest from Tinseltown.  My goodness is our plate full tonight.  Who's up first, Anthony?  We'll tell you what Brad and Angelina are up to.  Hey, that sounds super.  Yeah, maybe getting bit by snakes is better.  Yeah, but instead he's telling us a story during the break about being bit by a snake.  He's showing us the scar from when he was doing the noodling. 
[01:54:30]  The noodling, I said it during the break, scariest thing ever.  Enough about noodling.  Who did we catch canoodling in a Los Angeles club last night?  We'll have the answer for you right after this.  That's got to be the scariest thing, though, this noodling for catfish,  where you're just reaching your waist high in a swamp, right?  And then you're reaching into these tunnels, or what do you call them, little caves?  Well, catfish are bottom feeders.  They live in the mud.  They live in rocks. 
[01:55:00]  And basically, noodling is the oldest form of fishing there is.  And it's just barehanded, all by touch.  So you stick your hand in a nasty, dirty hole, and if something bites you,  you grab its jaw, you pull it out, and congratulations, you've noodled.  I would never be able to do that.  You're using your fingers as bait.  That's pretty much it.  I've seen guys pull catfish out with their feet.  They'll use anything as bait, anything.  And then he showed us the scar.  He got bit nice.  Yeah.  And then the snake story was pretty good, too.  Kristen, the snake lady at Put-In Bay, Ohio, is going to be coming up next season, I guess. 
[01:55:30]  But she throws herself, throws her body on indigenous water snakes in an attempt to catch them,  take them back to the Ohio State lab, shove some sort of probe into their bottoms,  make them puke, analyze their vomit, and then release them back into the wild.  This is a bad job.  We federally grant the federal, so taxpayer dollars.  Literally hundreds of dollars, Anthony.  That's literally in the hundreds.  It's a major program.  In the hundreds of dollars. 
[01:56:00]  We're deep in four figures.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And, yeah, so you've got to kind of headlong charge these snakes.  You find a snake.  You see it crawl out of Lake Erie.  You charge it.  You throw yourself on it, and it bites you.  And non-venomous is the good news.  But they have teeth, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, not necessarily fangs, but they have a mouthful of teeth.  And they're snakes.  And they're snakes.  It's naturally scary things.  Every sane person in the reptilian part of our own brain knows, don't chase a snake. 
[01:56:30]  No.  And if you do, don't grab it.  And if you do, don't let it bite you.  So there are three fundamental rules you have to break in order to do this job.  And, you know, this woman does them hundreds of times a day.  I spend a day with her.  I'll never go back.  No, I hear, and I can't wait to see the episode, but I hear you might not handle this as manly  as you would have liked to.  It's not my finest hour.  And to suggest that I scream like a 10-pound baby girl would not be to overstate it.  All right. 
[01:57:00]  That I can't wait to see.  Yeah.  But on the positive side, I bleed a lot.  Oh, good.  That's always good for TV.  It's a sweet experience.  We're doing what we can.  Hey, with that, we've got to say hi to Chyna sitting over there.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Do you know Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs?  No, I don't.  Oh, my God.  Chyna, at the Discovery Channel, Tuesdays at 9.  Where have you been?  All over the place, really.  Quite honestly.  Yeah, he does that Dirty Jobs.  Yeah, it's been a crazy month for me.  Yeah?  Why has it been crazy? 
[01:57:30]  Well, I haven't been.  I'm sorry.  I haven't been watching the Discovery Channel.  Oh, that's okay.  I'm not keeping up with your work either, but I'm interested.  I've been out for like days at a time with my girlfriends.  Is that what you do?  Just hang out?  A lot of partying?  What do you do these days?  I have been doing a lot of partying, actually.  Well, I did.  I'm coming out with three movies.  I've got three big movies coming out.  One is just another romantic wrestling comedy where I actually do some of my last wrestling  there with one of my Japanese friends, Kenny Asuda.  And I did Illegal Aliens, easy for me to say, with Anna Nicole Smith, which is throughout 
[01:58:00]  the spring, I believe, and Surreal Life, and then another movie called The Cougar Club with  Faye Dunaway and Jolie Fisher.  Oh, so the Surreal Life.  And so I've been doing a lot.  So the Surreal Life, and it was kind of a change from the person that we had seen in  the ring.  Yeah, it actually was a total change. 
[01:58:30]  And, you know, there was a confrontation with the ex-boyfriend, and it was really...  Well, more so that in the ring, you came off, you know, like you did.  You're very powerful, very strong, intimidating, and on Surreal Life, kind of crazy.  Yeah, absolutely.  I went into Surreal Life thinking that I was probably going to be dead by the time I came  out.  Really?  Crazy and crying a lot.  Yeah, so I said, you know, if you thought you had two weeks to live, and you were in  a house, kooky house, and, you know... 
[01:59:00]  Wait, you really thought you only had a couple weeks to live?  You thought you were heading that way?  It was definitely heading that way.  Why?  What was the biggest problem?  Just everything falling apart in your life?  No, I was having such an issue with domestic violence with the ex-boyfriend that, you know,  it was getting bad.  I was going to end up in jail, and we were, you know, I'd wake up and...  That must just not be like regular domestic violence.  Like, that must just be...  That's surreal violence.  ...cares over the head, and...  Yeah, two wrestlers of domestic violence involved. 
[01:59:30]  That can't be good.  Was there someone calling it?  Oh my God, he just punched her in the eye!  It's the maid or something calling them.  Yeah.  The bouts.  Every time he hits her, the cop is looking the other way, and they...  King and J.R. are in the room.  Yeah, you can't just say that casually.  Like, why was your domestic violence, like, so much worse than the average domestic violence?  Well, I think, first of all, it probably wasn't so much worse.  It was probably very typical, except for the fact that mine was in the public eye, and, you 
[02:00:00]  know, it was a really difficult experience.  And all the laws had changed after the, you know, the O.J. Simpson, and...  Now, we were talking about X-Pac?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, I didn't know how to deal with all that stuff, and so it was very difficult.  Now, the odd thing is...  It was a long time.  It might sound weird that I kind of want to know this, but the fighting in real life,  as opposed to, like, in the ring, which, you know, you guys would get physical and stuff, 
[02:00:30]  but domestically, at home, with X-Pac, who was beating who?  Who, like, were you able to put a hurtin' on him?  No, you know, I was able to...  In the heat of the moment, I learned, like, you know, most people don't know this, but  after WWF, I trained with New Japan Professional Wrestling.  I trained for, like, a year, and then went to Japan, and I fought, actually grappled in  front of 82,000 people at the Tokyo Dome. 
[02:01:00]  And I think that really saved my life, because I was able to defend myself, and in the heat  of the moment, you know, he'd be so frickin' whacked out, and so technically good, and  stronger than me.  I mean, you know...  Yeah.  When you see me in wrestling, you think I'm, you know, six foot two and a jolly green giant,  you know?  Yeah, that's why, you know, you come across like, oh, she can take care of herself.  Right, and I did.  You know, I was lucky enough to be able to defend myself.  Well, the house must have been a wreck. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Just a wreck.  Well, I moved, like, three times.  There were holes in the wall.  I could just picture holes the shape of people through the walls.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, let me tell you a laugh.  Like, were the Terminators fighting in that hallway throwing you through the wall?  Yeah.  That's what I picture.  I mean, I'm sorry for laughing, but it's sort of one of those scenes that you kind of picture,  and you just, yeah, picture the roof coming down on top of you two.  Well, and it was, yeah, I wished it would have come down on the top of us, actually, many  times, but, you know, it was just so bad with all of the drugs and, you know, the manipulation. 
[02:02:00]  It was.  Now, how would you get into it?  Because, you know, you were riding high.  You really were.  I mean, you were top of your game with the WWF at the time.  And, like, where did it go wrong?  Where did it take that left turn and go wrong?  Well, I started noticing something strange, you know, probably about a year before my  contract ended, and I just couldn't figure it out because I was doing great. 
[02:02:30]  And then I noticed I started working more and more, and, you know, there was just this  odd kind of vibe.  But you were one of the most popular characters at that time.  Yes.  Like, you came out, everybody went crazy, you know?  And I was happy and doing great, and, you know.  So, and then I figured out that, you know, Triple H was having an affair with Stephanie  McMahon, Vince McMahon's daughter, and then I got the boot.  It sounded like a storyline. 
[02:03:00]  So, after that, you know, I didn't know what to do.  He's cheating on you, and you end up losing your job over it.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Good God.  And so, you know, overnight, everything was gone, and I'm like, okay, there's, you know,  millions of fans out there that are going to hate me because the rumors were that I was  asking for tons of money or that I was, you know.  Yeah, it was all like contract stuff.  Meanwhile, it was Triple H has to pick the boss's daughter.  Right.  So, I just tried to, you know, walk away the best I could with quiet humility and figured  no problem, just go do my thing in Hollywood, you know, and get some shows, and it just 
[02:03:30]  wasn't that easy.  So, it's been, you know, a real long time to get from, you know, that was 2000 to now,  you know?  Yeah.  So, I'm really proud to have this stuff coming out and, you know, working on some new reality  shows for me to jump to the next level and just for me, you know, and...  Was Xbox a bad influence?  Some music.  Like, did you hook up with him immediately after all that when you got the boot? 
[02:04:00]  No, you know, I was doing really great on my own.  I had gotten over the heartbreak and was starting from scratch and, you know, had my own place  and a roof over my head and, you know, everything cool, new cars, new everything.  And then he showed up on my doorstep one day and I was like, oh my God, you know, we've  been friends for so long.  He said, I got a divorce from my wife and, you know, I was in love.  I thought, gosh, he walked away and, hey, I'm the only one that's, you know, stuck to 
[02:04:30]  my guns and said, you know...  And how does...  But how do people that, like, are kind of into their physical health and everything get  into drugs like that, you know?  I didn't know.  I was not...  You know, during the whole time I was with WWF.  I mean, I was with Triple H.  I was with Paul the whole time.  So I would go, do my job, go back to the hotel room, you know.  I was totally naive to half the stuff that was going on until I got together with X-Pac.  And when I first saw X-Pac, he was in the best shape I'd ever seen him in. 
[02:05:00]  He was, you know, I thought, going to a different wrestling organization.  He, you know, looked great.  He was happy to see me and it was instant love.  And then a month later, he asked me to marry him and then, you know, and then I got clothes  lined over the kitchen table.  And I'm like, hey, I'm sorry, I'm not a good cook.  I made the steak.  Do you regret the release of One Night in China? 
[02:05:30]  Do you regret that?  It was horrible.  Do you know, he actually went to the country of China.  First of all, I consider that his tape because I had filmed like a bunch of stuff kind of  wanting to do a reality type of show because some of the stuff we did was so freaking funny.  So I had these tapes.  There was a little bit of, you know, kind of risque content on it that we had, you know,  played around and stuff, but nothing too big.  And then he actually then took off, took those tapes and brought them to, you know, 
[02:06:00]  Red Light District and sold them out from underneath me and made a deal for more content, basically.  And, you know, so then when I had him on my back and I thought other people were involved  in the porno industry, I mean, I was like, okay, well, I'm just going to finish this off  and then try and not let it come out, you know.  And he actually went to the country of China so that he could claim rights to the name. 
[02:06:30]  Did he, he had to go to China?  That's what he did, yeah.  To claim rights to the name.  And so I, you know, just, I have not collected a dime of it.  Really?  You're very thorough.  I'm putting it.  I don't want to see it.  It's in your credits, though.  And, you know, it keeps popping up there, you know.  I got a one sheet on China Doll and it says One Night in China, 2004, along with her credits.  Well, it's probably all credits. 
[02:07:00]  I'm sure even from her people.  For a while, I mean, it really, it really bothered me.  I mean, it was like.  You really haven't seen the movie?  No.  It's great.  I laughed.  I cried.  I felt great about myself.  It's the feel-good hit of the song, though.  Yeah, really.  I was a fan, I've got to be honest.  I'm not a wrestling fan.  I don't really watch as much wrestling, but I saw that tape.  I was really instantly attracted to it.  Very much.  China, I've got to explain.  Someone has to hear.  What do you got going on down there?  Oh, you're lovely. 
[02:07:30]  Jimmy is beyond happy.  Yeah, you're the greatest.  He likes when it's, you know, the size of.  Yeah, I was a fan.  I just was very, very much.  I didn't want to look at it.  I'm kind of embarrassed.  I just, it was a fantastic time.  You never came off.  I like when they're large, too.  Are you guys?  No, but.  I wasn't very impressed with the other guy.  I've got to be honest.  With him, I wasn't that impressed with a wrestler.  I was like, that's a wrestler?  I mean, that's, you know.  Well, yeah, it might be the steroids.  You never know.  We've heard the rumors that it shrinks a little bit when you're doing the roids, right? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, I was like, that's fantastic if you're 5'6", 1's 45, but he's a wrestler.  No, you were never shy, though.  I mean, you had done layouts in Playboy and stuff.  Right.  So, you know, you weren't shy about being nude.  It was just that was kind of taking it to the next level.  Yeah, well, it was taking it, well, I'll say.  Certainly.  You know.  The next 20 levels, let me say that.  Is that what they're calling it now?  Yeah, the next level.  You only date wrestlers, by the way?  No, I actually want nothing to do with that world. 
[02:08:30]  Jimmy just broke up with his girl.  You know.  And he likes, you know.  He's a comedian.  He's funny.  And you could beat the crap out of him.  Yeah, we had a bad breakup.  I'm very injured and vulnerable.  You know what you did?  Yeah.  Really?  I'm very wounded.  Yeah.  There were some bad things that were said.  Was this recent?  Yeah, a couple nights ago.  It's awful.  I'm so sorry.  Thank you.  Could you give him a hug?  Do you need some boobies to cry on?  Yeah, give him a hug.  Can you give him a little hug?  He's really sad.  It seems reasonable.  Look at his eyes. 
[02:09:00]  He has a sand.  It's okay.  It's like puppy dogs, man.  That's no for the hug, Jimmy.  I tried.  Wow.  I tried.  She hugged me and then just threw me through both of them.  Hysterical.  Laugh out loud.  Funny.  Yeah, whatever kind of funny you want.  Oh, my God.  We haven't talked before, but we haven't actually really.  No, we haven't seen each other in person.  No, we talked over the phone a few times before we kind of got fired.  We got fired a couple of times. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had to go to China.  We got thrown out.  Yeah.  Had to go to China to justify the name.  Oh, the humility.  That amazes me that he actually had to get a ticket, go to China.  What, did he have to, like, film the Great Wall or something and then throw it in there?  Or else Vince would have been all over him?  Yes.  Was that the whole thing?  Like, Vince owns the name?  You know, who knows?  Who cares?  That's what we're working on.  But besides, yeah, I mean, people still call me China. 
[02:10:00]  I know.  That's just it.  They call me Joe now.  It's ridiculous.  And China doll and whatever, you know.  But I don't know.  This really doesn't matter.  I'm cool with it.  Yeah.  Mike, you got a question for China?  I've been making a list.  An amazing story, right?  I mean, you sure you haven't seen the show?  He's wondering why she hasn't seen the show.  I'm just, I don't want to talk out of school, but I believe you'd like it.  I think you'd find things in it that are inherently relatable. 
[02:10:30]  I think you'd laugh.  I think it'd bring a certain measure of peace.  I mean, you know, it's a very cathartic hour.  And it's on the Discovery Channel, so, you know, it's good for the whole family.  Jumping snakes with teeth.  It's dirty jobs.  It's dirty jobs.  He does like jobs that no one else wants.  Why don't you marry X-Pac?  That sounds like it.  You know, I mean, we're coming into season three.  All bets are off.  Just for the record, he might be interested.  Oh!  You could burn the waffles and he could punch you in the face. 
[02:11:00]  There's something like that right there.  Really?  Yeah.  Really.  Interesting.  Well, not that you would ever admit that, but did he ever say, like, you know,  hey, there's a cool piece of equipment you could put around your waist and attack me with?  Maybe you could.  I'm just curious.  No, I think he probably had plenty of other volunteers.  Other, yeah, other gentlemen that may have been around the, um...  It's just nothing like the real thing.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they say.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Look what China is saying. 
[02:11:30]  A bit of a revelation.  The gloves are off.  Did he ever get a little hammered, maybe?  They were never on.  There you go.  Did he ever get a little hammered, maybe, and, like, tell you things like,  hey, there was one time this dude, me, anything like that?  No, but he used to say, like, oh, this guy hit on me, or...  Really?  You know, I think he was hitting on me, and then I started thinking, okay, something's  just not right here.  That is odd.  You know?  Guys don't usually...  Just... 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  ...speculation, but my intuition's pretty good.  Yeah.  You have good gay arms, actually.  And you're with him, yeah.  You know?  You're with him.  You know, how long were you actually with him?  Well, a month every day, and then I gave him back his ring, and I was like, ah, you know,  get away from me, but, and then I referred to him, a.k.a. the seed of Chucky, came back,  like, for two years.  I dealt with this.  Oh, kept coming back?  And it was just...  Wait, in the first month, you had domestic violence and a porno tape made?  In the first month, you guys were together?  No, the, the tape was made, actually, later, because I would take him back, and then go 
[02:12:30]  back, you know, whatever.  Oh, you were like, the textbook, uh...  It's a makeup sex.  Take him back.  From the makeup sex.  You know, because...  Might lose a wall or two, but the makeup sex was great.  It was tremendous.  You know, it's a bit confusing, because you're in athletics, you know, and you think, oh,  they, you know, they're hurting, or, you know, they're doing certain things because,  you know, their bodies are sore, or whatever, and that just wasn't...  That wasn't the case.  The drywall contractors crying when they finally broke up.  Oh, I was gonna put a wing on my house. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  Here goes the skylight.  Yeah.  Yeah, just...  That's probably what they just did.  Just kept putting in skylights.  Another skylight.  Wow, that just sounds like a brutal relationship.  Oh, man.  You know.  God.  But you were, like, you were a very well-known person.  And you couldn't just kind of get away from them, and not take them back, and find someone  else, and...  I couldn't.  When I started doing that, it was just...  It was bizarre, because we were in the public eye. 
[02:13:30]  And, you know, I didn't want to be aggressive and stand up for myself in public, because,  you know, then it would be me, because he was playing the manipulative, you know, I love  her, and all that stuff.  And I thought, I'm gonna get it if I go nuts on him, and then, you know, if I don't go  nuts on him, then it's gonna make it look like, you know, I'm with him, and I want to  be with him.  And it was very confusing, and I couldn't imagine how any woman could ever go through  that.  But plus, you know, I've been made out to be this, you know, monster, and I am... 
[02:14:00]  The truth is, is that I am very technically trained now, and I'm very good at what I do,  but, you know, I've never been physically violent ever in my life.  And especially after learning, technically, I wouldn't use that, just out of...  That is such a misconception, because you would think, like, there's no way she's being,  like, abused domestically.  Would you say you're more dominant or submissive sexually?  I'm only asking that because you're such, obviously, you're probably just a kick-ass person, 
[02:14:30]  and a lot of powerful women are very, very submissive in that area.  So would you say that you would go more submissive, or are you just like, what everybody would  think, which would be that you're very dominant?  I would say...  I would say a little both.  Hmm.  Sub-dominant.  Depending on...  Yeah.  Depending on who she's with.  No, I've never had a problem in that area.  No, I'm just curious, because, like, I tend to be very dominant, and I can't picture, obviously,  you know, dominating somebody like her, although I can certainly picture it, but I mean, I 
[02:15:00]  don't...  You can't stop picturing it.  No, I would be very submissive with her, though, I can imagine.  She has very lovely feet.  I'm not even into feet, but you take good care of yours.  I hope you show an awful club soda, Kenny, over there in the Tubbs jacket, if you showed  him your toes.  He likes feet.  He won't admit it, but he loves toes.  Do you have a foot fetish?  No, not at all.  But, I mean, yours are wonderful, and I don't notice feet.  Yes, you're very well-kempt.  Jimmy seems to be attracted to you.  Oh, you're fantastic.  Jimmy seems to be attracted to you.  Well, okay, I hear this all the time, but everybody says, so, are you surprised now seeing 
[02:15:30]  me, like, do you think that...  Am I what you expected?  Much better.  Yeah, much hotter than I...  You know, I only saw that...  I'm very pop culture ignorant.  I think you're...  Last I saw was Surreal Life, so I thought a real mess was going to be coming to that door.  Yeah, yeah, the truth.  I'm sorry to disappoint you.  I said, no, believe me, I'm happy for you.  I really am.  She's a bit intimidating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I find you to be very, very put together, very self-possessed. 
[02:16:00]  You seem to absolutely be firing on all cylinders.  There you go.  Well, I'm working on it.  I've been having some issues here lately, but I'm actually in town for the Dr. Keith Ablo  show, so Lord knows what issues are going to come up.  Dr. Keith Ablo?  Yeah, yeah.  I think I'm going to him later for a molar.  Oh, that was a different guy.  All right, what's the big plug there, China Doll?  We've got to get out of here.  We've got the three movies coming out, and look for a surreal life to be determined.  Working on some music. 
[02:16:30]  Hopefully next time I come here, I'll be able to throw you guys a diss, see what I'm doing,  playing bass guitar and keyboards, and a whole new Joni Lauer will show up.  Very cool.  Very cool.  Mike Rowe.  And Dr. Keith Ablo.  Yes, yes.  Mike Rowe, Dirty Jobs.  What else?  That's pretty much my life right now.  That's it.  Access Hollywood.  No access Hollywood, Anthony.  No, I'm taking a pass on that.  Hey, thanks for dropping by here.  Hey, any time.  Thank you.  All right, Jimmy.  Tonight at 9.30 at Comics Comedy Club on West 14th, I'm doing an American Cancer Society 
[02:17:00]  benefit.  Myself, Bill Burke, Colin Quinn, Fat Bobby Kelly, Keith Robinson, and Corey Kahaney, we're  giving away some tickets on the walkover.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2500 tonight.  It's for a great cause and a really beautiful comedy club.  There you go.  We continue on XM.  Have a great day.  Thanks.  See ya.  Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 
[02:17:30]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents, and you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless 
[02:18:00]  shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  That's what this song is, right?  The rest of my life with a cinema. 
[02:18:30]  That's the song, right?  Hey, let's get right into it.  Club Soda County saw it, too.  Hi.  There was love in Jimmy's eyes up there.  Let's be honest, Jimmy.  Yeah, she's really sexy, man.  I mean, she's really sexy.  Talking about China from WWF.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Well, we noticed that when we first watched the porno tape.  Right.  I was telling Mike Rowe in the elevator.  Like, our reaction was, holy shit, what the fuck is that?  And Jimmy's like, I'm in love.  I'll take better care of that than that fucking jackass she was dating with his fucking mediocre 
[02:19:00]  dick and his puncher-in-the-face routine.  Perhaps she did burn that steak.  Oh, she's lovely.  How tall is she, though?  She's not as big as I thought.  She used to wear big heels.  She's solid, man.  It's density.  It's both density.  She gave me a nice hug, too.  Yeah.  Nice hug.  She smells really good.  Lovely bosoms.  She used to wear big heels, I think.  Yeah.  Jimmy, is there anything we could do to help you out here?  Because you really, really are into her.  I saw it in your eye.  There's nothing. 
[02:19:30]  She used to...  No, it's not pleased.  You're thinking maybe you could get, I don't know, an afternoon out of it.  I'm wondering if I should do Pilates to help my abs.  She wrestled in front of 80,000 people.  Invite her to the show tonight.  Look at the...  Invite her to the show tonight.  No.  She wants to come.  She'll show up.  Yeah, she'll come.  A lot of fans.  She's getting a...  They're loving the China over there in the breezeway.  Wrestling fans.  Jimmy, what is it about her, though?  She creeps me out.  I think she's pretty.  I think...  I don't know.  I'd like to make out with her.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to make out with her?  Yeah.  Is there something...  Let me just...  I'll ask you this, Jimmy. 
[02:20:00]  China!  Is there something a little tranny about her?  Oh, yeah.  What isn't?  Yeah.  Jimmy wants to make out with you.  Her voice.  Remember Jimmy?  Jimmy got his hug, by the way, after the show.  Yeah, she was very...  I really go into it.  She was very nice.  Mike Rowe in the elevator is like, you showed a lot of restraint with that interview.  I'm like, you know what?  I wanted to say some things, and I'm thinking, I'm fast-forwarding my head, that I get beat  up, and I don't care.  I would be beat up by a girl.  Yeah.  I don't care that she's professionally trained and all that with Japanese guys. 
[02:20:30]  In the end, I get beat up by a girl.  I hate these fucking eBay autograph guys.  What are you talking about?  I don't mind you getting something signed because you want something signed because I love getting  shit signed.  Yeah.  But these guys that show up with 30 things for someone to sign, I'd like to fucking smash  their hands with bats because they fuck it up for the rest of us who buy stuff, who  get stuff that we love signed.  Let's do it.  These fucking jerk-offs.  Is this mic working?  Yeah, Mike's mic is not working.  Get Mike's mic working.  Get Mike's mic working.  I hate it. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, guy.  How many things do you guys bring?  Fucks.  Holy shit do I hate those motherfuckers.  I hate them.  30 things for the girl to sign.  You know what?  How about one picture for your own collection?  Jimmy doesn't care.  There's a guy with...  No, that doesn't annoy me.  They do it to everyone when it comes.  He's got a huge plastic bag and he just keeps pulling shit out of it.  Why would you keep signing that?  Just tell him to fuck off.  Rip.  Fucking cocksucker.  He's going to sell it all on eBay.  Jimmy's...  Oh, I hate those fucks.  Jimmy is... 
[02:21:30]  I know what's going on though, Jimmy.  Because she's doing that, she can't be over here talking to us.  Right.  And maybe some magic will happen between you and her.  Nah, she's going to leave.  She's not coming with us.  But they do it to everyone that walks out the door and they fuck it up for everybody that  wants a legitimate thing signed.  They're cock blocking.  And I mean her cock.  That's why celebrities don't want to sign shit.  Talk to China, Jimmy.  How many things did they just ask you to sign that they were going to...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Whoa.  Oh.  Wow.  I think there's a love connection. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, she is fantastic.  Wow.  What just happened there, Jimmy?  Uh-huh.  They dropped their pictures.  Uh-huh.  That was just crazy insane.  They were bugging me yesterday to sign all that shit.  Yeah, he really digged you, man.  Look at those two creeps go up all the time and they just sell it on eBay.  China, would you sit on Jimmy's face?  Yeah, not right now.  No, I can't do it here in the street, but back at XM I could.  Really?  Oh, I love her.  I have a tremendous crush on her.  I think she's fantastic.  Mike, would you like to see that?  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Would that be considered a dirty job, an interesting job?  What kind of job would that be?  It's the kind of job you have to wait before you pass any kind of judgment on.  I'd be curious to see how it plays out.  Yeah.  I know what kind of job Jimmy's hoping for.  Language.  I'm a fan, though.  She's great.  Yeah, he really...  We saw...  Wait, where's Club Soda Kenny?  Kenny hangs out with Jimmy a lot.  What did you see up there?  The look of love, the glistening in his eye. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  You're his type.  Really?  Yeah, he's got a thing for you.  Yeah, she's lovely.  This is the thing.  This is the thing.  And what type is that?  I don't know.  I don't have a type.  He just means I like you.  I wouldn't say I have a type.  I mean, I don't care.  Blonde, brunette, tall, short.  I think you being taller than him helps.  I think you're a powerful girl.  I think that helps.  She takes very good care of herself.  Yeah, you're very...  How sexy and...  Well taken care of.  How lovely is that?  Shonda, how tall are you?  5'10".  I was right. 
[02:23:30]  Okay, it's the heels there.  Yeah, that's right.  She's not...  Always got to wear the heels.  You know?  She's a little bigger than me.  It's because you have to stab somebody and look feminine at the same time.  The only problem would be the nudity thing because you're in amazing physical condition.  I'm working on it.  I'm trying to work on my abs and I'd be very embarrassed to be shirtless.  You know what?  You can always change the outside, but it's the inside that counts.  That's true.  Women say that when they're not fucking you.  That's what women always say when they're not fucking you.  Yeah, it's the inside that counts, but when you're in bed, it's a little different. 
[02:24:00]  Does Jimmy have a shot on any planet in the known universe?  Yeah.  You know what?  All guys have a shot.  They can be charming and, you know.  Jimmy is charming.  I'll give him that.  Yeah, she's a tremendous...  You don't find that too much these days.  She's very diplomatic.  Well, he has a shot.  I like to be romanced and have a good time and, you know, have some fun.  Yeah, I'm fun.  I like to eat a lot.  Do you like oysters?  I've been on an oyster kick lately.  It's all I eat.  I do.  I hear they help your libido.  They help your sexual drive. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  I do.  Yeah.  And the pearls in them, too, are awesome.  I've never found the pearl in them.  Yeah, we might want to start.  Maybe we can go out for oysters sometime.  There's a hell of an asking for a date there.  Good job.  The oysters?  Good job, Jimmy.  Maybe oysters.  I'm a little nervous.  Sometimes they like it when you're shy.  Jimmy, that's shucking.  That's not shy.  Shucking.  That's shucking.  What are you guys doing out here?  Are you out here picking up chicks?  Isn't this ridiculous?  They throw us out of that studio at nine, but we continue to do radio. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  We broadcast on, now we're uncensored at XM, which is why we can curse, and we walk over  and do uncensored radio on XM.  We do five hours a day.  Satellite radio.  Oh, thank you.  So we do broadcast radio, and then we do satellite.  So we're walking over to go curse, and wow.  Oh, we already started the fucking cursing.  That's when you get the chicks.  Yeah.  They can kind of let you see it all.  And the face plant, because Jimmy wants a face plant badly today.  What's a face plant?  Well, you want her to sit on your face, I guess.  Well, she's beautiful.  I mean, I wouldn't ask her like that. 
[02:25:30]  That's something that kind of comes in time.  You don't do that on a first meeting.  Well, you never know, though.  A couple of oysters in.  No, no, he's right.  He's right.  At least later on.  She's probably a nice girl, and she takes a little.  She has to like you a certain degree, and she doesn't know me well enough.  I mean, she's just looking at me and probably seeing like this pretty face and stuff,  but there's more to me than just my appearance.  I have nothing.  She dated Triple H.  How do I compete with that?  Is he packing, by the way?  Is he packing?  X-Pac, I was not impressed with.  Is Triple H packing?  That's okay.  Yeah, not what you'd expect, right? 
[02:26:00]  Actually, I haven't been disappointed in either one of those stories, but you know.  That's nice.  All right, so you're not a size queen.  You're more the guy, the whole package.  You like the whole thing, the guy, please.  She sounds like she's a size queen.  She wants bigger.  She's a little disappointed, but she's too nice to say it.  No, I mean, it was okay, you know what I mean?  But then, now that I started dating, and like, yeah, I was dating a guy for a couple months,  and it was a little different, you know, and I was like, whoa.  Oh, he was really, was he a wrestler, or no, just a regular guy?  No, he was actually a model.  Wow.  So. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, if she takes wrestlers and models, what am I going to do with her?  I went from, you know, wrestler to model to skinny little musician, so.  Is that your fellow right there?  No, that's my manager.  Oh, okay, good.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, should we start walking next, Sam?  Yeah, we'll take our walk.  All right.  We're going to walk.  Hello, sir.  Bye.  Thank you so much.  Very sweet.  Nice talking to you.  Yes, she's been great.  All right.  Thank you.  He loves you.  Oh, she's in love.  She smells really good.  You are in love.  Oh, yeah, man. 
[02:27:00]  She smells great.  Jimmy, I don't get it.  I know, but I think she's, I think she's really kissable lips.  I totally get it.  She's very kissable lips.  Dude, dude.  She is a female tranny.  And Jimmy loves the trannies.  Right.  That's.  And this way, he can be with a tranny without it being at all gay.  Without visiting Europe.  Right.  See?  Again.  You don't have to visit Europe.  You don't have to stay in America.  That's almost like, that's like going to like Little Italy.  It's already here.  Mike, you got it.  It's one of my favorite things recently. 
[02:27:30]  Jimmy, every once in a while, he has a nice hobby.  He kind of, he kind of has.  Mike understands.  Who doesn't love a tranny every now and again?  It's only a good man's fault, Mike.  Just to mix it up.  Just to keep it up.  Absolutely.  Just to feel silly.  But his good friend Patrice goes, now that means you're gay.  But Jimmy explains his way out of that.  Patrice said, how does that not make you gay?  And I said, look, just because you travel to Europe doesn't make you a European. 
[02:28:00]  You go, you come back, you're still an American.  But would you consider like dual citizenship?  No, no, no, no, no.  Good question, though.  No, no, no.  I don't spend enough time in Europe.  It's like a working visa.  Right.  You know.  You got a working visa.  You can stay for six months.  After that, you know, you're on your own, dude.  I was like, man, Patrice nailed him.  Finally.  Then he explained his way out of that.  No, no, no.  Oh, she is sexy, though.  I like to kiss her.  She looks like she'd be great to kiss. 
[02:28:30]  You want to kiss her?  Yes.  See, that's more than just a sexual thing.  You really have a thing for her.  Dude, I saw it in his eyes.  Yeah.  No, but kissing is part of a sexual thing.  I like that.  Look at her.  Would you kiss her?  But it's more intimate.  Yeah.  Like, it's even more intimate than just a quick, you know.  Full lips like that, man.  She'd wrap her arms around you.  Just be nice to kiss.  There's something almost mothering about it because she's bigger than me.  And I'm usually not a bigger girl.  Yeah, she's bigger.  She's got a huge set of tits on her.  And a beautiful pussy, man.  Oh, when I spend a lot of time on that.  I don't care. 
[02:29:00]  She needs soft implants.  A lot of collagen going on there, right?  I would take such good care of that pussy.  Really good.  Wow, you're really into this.  I would eat it well.  Were you feeling anything from her?  No, she's just nice.  Nothing, right?  I don't know.  You never know, though.  But she can pick and choose, man, because she is who she is.  Yeah.  So what am I going to do?  Fucking fat little gut.  Trying to do some crunches.  I did three sets of 25.  Oh, fat pig.  Don't set yourself short.  You're terrific.  Thank you.  That makes me feel better, Kenny.  Mike, Jimmy's lost a lot of weight.  He's hitting a heavy bag, and now he's beating himself up. 
[02:29:30]  But I mean, yeah, but when you start trying to fuck professional ex-wrestlers, you realize  that you have a little more heavy bag hitting to do.  Hey, what do the H's stand for, by the way?  This whole Triple H thing.  Oh, it's Hunter Hurst Helmsley.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's his wrestling name.  I guess his name's Paul.  Yeah.  Because that's what she said.  Hunter?  They all got their names.  Boy, it's not going to be on all the wrestling websites.  It's a China called X-Pac.  Outed X-Pac, pretty much.  That was awkward, man.  Wow.  But not a little like, oh, really? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I mean, I was kind of expecting you guys to just take that, but then I guess in  the interest of self-preservation, what do you mean?  Exactly.  We're not dumb.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah, we've got to leave that studio every day.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, we're kind of targets here, aren't we?  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  We had nothing to do with what she was saying today.  Like she did.  We just gave her the forum to say it.  Well, she had a mic on.  See, like if I took a Cialis, like my dick is not great, but it definitely looks better 
[02:30:30]  than you think it's going to look at my size, and she's been with those big guys who  you expect to have huge cocks and don't.  She would fucking dig me.  She would dig me a little bit.  You think so?  Smack it on our lips a little.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Cialis, are you ready?  I love a Cialis.  Three days later, your fucking dick is hard for no reason.  Dude, the pressure of that ad campaign is staggering.  Are you ready?  I mean, what a question.  Yeah.  It's huge.  What are we doing today?  Oh, I don't know.  I kind of like it out here today.  It's nice out.  I'm going to give away the tickets.  Oh, tickets.  Oh, tickets. 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy, you got tickets?  Yeah.  Who am I going to give them to?  There it is.  All right, well, I'll give some to Eric, and I can give a pair to Danny, and I'll give  some to Mike Rowe, and to China.  I should have invited her.  Not that she would have come.  Not a big crowd today for the walkover.  No, they were all stuck over there.  I hate that fucking...  Here's a big fan.  Oh, hi, sir.  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Can we give him tickets?  Yeah.  Tickets.  Yeah, give him eight.  Those fucking eBay guys, I fucking hate them.  Cocksuckers.  With eight things, they ask someone to sign. 
[02:31:30]  And how about this?  And how about this?  Fucking shithead.  That really upsets him.  Yeah, because you know what?  Then you try to get something legitimate signed, because you love the...  Right.  Because you want it for your wall, for yourself, and they won't sign it, because they're sick  of their shit being sold.  Because they're scumbags like that.  Mike, he's out of his mind.  And then DiMaggio and those guys got to fucking charge you for autographs, because these fucking  vultures don't have real jobs.  That's why guys don't want to sign baseballs for kids on the way into the fucking O2.  That's why I don't sign.  Cocksuckers.  That's not me either.  I hate them.  We all knocked that shit out of their hands when you see them. 
[02:32:00]  That dumpy motherfucker in his tower records bag.  Give me some of his mind today.  That drives me nuts, dude.  You all right?  For real.  It drives me crazy.  He also got himself all worked up with China.  You get a little blood flow?  No, I'm too fucking ultimately depressed.  He's depressed, Mike.  I was supposed to go with my fucking girlfriend in Vegas.  I've never been on a plane with a girl I'm dating before.  Now that shot, I got a fucking extra plane ticket.  Yeah.  What are you going to do with the empty seat?  I don't know.  Just look at it and talk to it.  Yeah.  Talk to your empty plane seat.  The flight attendant will be, why do you keep asking the empty seat why it's a cunt? 
[02:32:30]  Why do you keep saying that?  For no reason.  Yeah, well, that's going to be awkward.  That's going to be an awkward plane ride, Jimmy.  Oh, man.  Can't get the refund?  No layover.  I don't think so, man.  No, no.  Mike, do you want to get a free flight to Vegas?  Gee, that just sounds great, Opie.  Yeah, can I trust you and then you can emasculate me?  Can you do that, please?  You bet.  You can count on me, man.  Actually, call him a selfish old piece of shit. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, that really annoys me, man.  All right.  Yeah.  You're doing a little better today, though?  The break-up's very fresh.  It comes back and forth, back and forth.  It's only a couple days old.  Is that old?  Was it 48 hours, 72 hours?  Yeah, 48 maybe, something like that.  Very fresh.  You're still in shock, man.  Yeah, a little over two days.  You're shocking.  Two days, yeah.  He's still in the shock period.  Yeah.  Period.  Yeah.  But he's got the prostitutes to fall back on.  I had good sex last night, yeah, man.  Really good.  She wasn't even that hot at all, chick.  But it's not about the hotness, Jimmy. 
[02:33:30]  She had what?  We learned that about you.  It's all vibe.  It's all vibe.  He was going to say she had a weird face, but she smelled good.  And it was a massage, wink.  I threw her an extra 80, and she put a bag on me and fucked me.  It was pretty hot.  Good thing you said that then, and not two seconds later.  Why?  When the child was walking by.  Why?  Teach him about condom use.  To her.  Teach your kid about fucking condoms.  Be safe, kid.  Yeah, I couldn't curse too loud.  All right, well. 
[02:34:00]  Who should we get the rest of these tickets to?  All right, no one.  How about you?  You look like you'd like to have a few laughs.  That is a fucking awful, no-smiling thing that just walked in.  My God.  Wow, what does this guy want?  Oh, this guy wants tickets.  Oh, yeah, give him tickets.  Where's the tickets?  Who's got them?  Well, where's Eric?  Iraq!  Give the guy tickets.  No, pay attention to your stupid peacoat.  Is this the guy that blew the horn?  That's fucking...  I don't know.  Hog, hog! 
[02:34:30]  Thank you, sir.  Eric's jacket bugs me.  I hope he's not bringing that with him.  I need ample parking.  Dude, that was my fault.  That guy drives the tow truck.  He knows me.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  You see a guy in the city driving a truck or picking up garbage?  They know me.  They know you.  They know me.  You're the blue-collar man.  Yeah.  Every man.  They all know Mike Rowe.  Look at this poor girl trying to get around, and everyone's in her way.  Oh, fucker.  Walk around.  Let's go upstairs.  We got to deal with her.  We're fucking fetching at a woman's issues. 
[02:35:00]  Just fucking make a half a circle.  He's bitter, man.  Mike, can you sit on Jimmy's face?  He did the little thing.  Wow.  Because China didn't make the walkover, and someone's got to sit on Jimmy's face today.  I'll shave my...  Did they hear that?  That was really funny.  We'll see you upstairs.  Obi and Anthony XM-202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing? 
[02:35:30]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Obi and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  I'm...  Opie. 
[02:36:00]  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:36:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:00]  All right, settling in for the XM show. 
[02:37:30]  Some people saying that China sounded like Roland.  They were enjoying the fact that China sounded a lot like Roland.  The turkey chili report, none.  Again, now they're screwing with me. 
[02:38:00]  Now the guy's doing it on purpose because he's the Seinfeld soup Nazi guy  and he's doing a no soup for you to me.  But I want that soup.  Well, no live reads for them.  How about that?  That's what we say now.  No live reads for them.  Damn them.  Let's do like something dirty today, Mike.  All righty.  Seriously, what can we do?  Get somebody up here and have them dredge out the toilet after Jimmy's in there.  Well, I wanted to eat like a moist cookie. 
[02:38:30]  No.  A moist cookie from a child's hand.  Well, no.  We can say retard in front of Mike.  He's okay.  He's fine with that word.  Banana, sweetie.  What's that?  What word?  Retard?  Retard's fine.  It's a perfectly legitimate word.  To impede or otherwise slow the progress of a thing.  Retard.  Do you know it says that when you go to France and your plane is delayed?  It says retard.  Je regrette le retardation. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, look at.  Well, bonjour to you, too.  This guy's too much.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Je ne sais pas.  Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six.  C'est un, deux, trois.  Donnez-moi un casse de transvestite.  He's making fun of you.  No, he's not. 
[02:39:30]  I didn't understand that.  Yes, he is.  I know.  I speak only English.  I heard a couple of keywords there.  Oh, I didn't get that.  Oh, I didn't get that.  He basically said that you're from France.  Hey, hey, you're from France.  You like tranny.  You don't like America after all is basically what he said.  I'm saying to you.  I understand.  All right.  Anyway.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Settling in. 
[02:40:00]  Getting our electronics up.  Yeah.  That's all.  Let's say hi to Jay in Texas.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, man.  I got a question for Mike.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay.  On your new episode, since you're on the Discovery Channel, are you going to do an episode  of the Croc Hunter for Dangerous Shops?  Not likely.  Although there certainly has been an opening, but we're still kind of like, what the heck,  man?  It seems dangerous.  Yeah.  I mean, everybody's still in shock over the whole thing.  You know, Steve was an expert at everything he did.  I'm an expert at nothing.  So, you know, we're not the same guy, even though we do the same sort of stuff. 
[02:40:30]  That's a little perspective on things, doesn't it?  Yeah.  A little reality.  A little too much.  What's your take on that, though?  Because you are in the same field.  Do you think that the Croc Hunter was kind of, you know, pushing the Stingray a little bit  to get some good video, or do you think it was as freak of an accident as they're trying  to say?  No, it's totally as...  I mean, I've held those things that size, you know, one in each hand, and there's...  It hurts when they sting you, but that's just so...  You've been stung?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I've been stung by Stingrays.  Yeah.  Three, four times.  It's like three, four... 
[02:41:00]  It's like a heavy-duty wasp or a hornet sting.  Oh, God.  It hurts, you know?  Yeah, wow.  No, he didn't die from a sting.  He died from, you know, his heart was punctured.  Yeah.  No, I understand that, but I'm wondering if he, like, put himself into a dangerous situation.  More of a dangerous situation than what he was already doing.  You know, swimming over a Stingray can't possibly...  I mean, in relative terms, good guy.  I mean, everybody knows what the guy's done in his life, you know?  This was...  What we just did was probably more dangerous, you know? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, crossing the street in Manhattan.  I thought you meant interviewing China.  Oh, well, clearly.  I mean, clearly.  Her Stinger is roughly the same size of the barb.  From what we've seen...  Hey, do we have the one night in China?  We got a picture of it?  That was a juicy push, man.  Just put it up on there and let it run during the show.  Yeah, you gotta just see what's going on, and...  It's not a good...  It's not a great porno at all.  It's not well done.  All right, you don't have to defend your woman.  No, no, I'm saying the next part did not do a good job.  You don't like the cinematography? 
[02:42:00]  Absolutely.  I mean, the China wall shots...  The lighting wasn't good.  I saw the boom in a couple of shots.  That wasn't a boom.  Oh, it wasn't, okay.  Too small to be a boom.  The fuck is that?  That was no boom.  This was no boating action.  Continuing with the Croc Hunter stuff, okay?  Yeah.  Did you ever feel like you were in danger?  Yeah.  Like, holy crap, this is not a good situation.  Well, you know, the big difference is, especially with Discovery, you know, they've put experts 
[02:42:30]  on the air for years and years and years, and the biggest departure from my show and the biggest  thing to point out is that I'm really not an expert.  So, you know, I've seen experts in these weird situations all my life, and, you know, for  me, it's still a big gut check because it's like, you know, my instinct is not to run toward  the snake and grab it, you know, even though I've seen people do it.  So, you know, the whole thing with Dirty Jobs is to try and, you know, put one arm around 
[02:43:00]  the viewer and say, you know, come on along, and then impersonate a host and an expert at  the same time and somehow try and balance the whole thing out.  Yeah.  Which is a long way of saying, at any given time, I'm crapping my pants, you know?  I mean, wearing a shark suit at 50 feet and letting sharks bite you, that's just jacked  up, and I don't care who you are.  You don't do that, yeah.  It's just, you know, I mean, you do it as safely as you can, you make the point, and then  you cross it off the list, you know, and move on.  But, yeah, I'm scared nine out of ten times.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I'm scared right now.  I would be, yeah.  What you'll see in a few moments will frighten you.  Oh, wow, will it?  I can't believe it.  And Jimmy will get all excited.  World's Deadliest Catch.  Yeah.  Is that coming back?  Yeah, I'm going up next week, sorry, next month.  Yeah.  January 11th, we'll be in Dutch Harbor, season three of that show.  That is a great show.  Anthony turned me up for that one.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's amazing.  He came in one day, he's like, I saw this show, and I watched it ever since.  And the way I described it, I was like, you're going to call me crazy, but I watched an 
[02:44:00]  entire marathon over the weekend of a program that shows crab fishing.  Yeah.  Because it sounds like, who the hell would want to watch this?  Because not many people know what goes into that.  People don't have a clue.  They have not a clue what goes into crab fishing.  And it's one of the most deadly jobs on the planet.  Well, when I started, the network called, and they kind of laid it out.  And my dad's family used to fish for crab in the Chesapeake.  So I'm like, crab fishing, yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Sounds like fun.  We'll get some chicken next, you know, pulling some blues.  No, no.  They're like, no, no.  It's a whole other ball game.  And they sent me the actuarial charts, okay, for, you know, fatalities and mortality, whatever.  And I thought it was a joke.  The injury rate is 100%.  The catastrophic injury rate is 11%.  And the mortality rate is one a week.  One a week, right?  So I go up there for six weeks.  Everybody I knew got hurt.  Yeah.  Everyone's got to get hurt.  That's 100%. 
[02:45:00]  10% of the guys who I met on the boats got seriously jacked up, like finger torn off, shoulder smashed, you know, pelvis crushed, this kind of thing.  And six guys died in six weeks.  So literally, the actuarial chart was like, you know, it was like prophecy.  It was insane.  This year, they've lost two guys already.  Boat went down a month ago.  What do they die?  Do they fall off the boat or do they get crushed by something on the boat?  There's so many fun, interesting ways to die on those boats. 
[02:45:30]  Well, here's the thing.  A crab pot is 800 pounds.  It's cast iron.  Every corner is sharp.  You got 50 of them on a boat stacked up 40 feet high.  Seas are 40 feet tall.  Winds are blowing 60 knots.  You're going straight into this ridiculous weather.  Don't forget the ice yet.  You're walking around with a baseball bat knocking ice off of the rigging so your boat doesn't get so top-heavy it flips over.  And, you know, that's how your day starts.  Have you seen this show, Jimmy?  I have seen moments of it, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  I remember watching it get knocked around.  Didn't one guy fall in that they had to go in and get?  Yeah, Kevin.  Yeah, Kevin fell off.  He was in the water about 90 seconds, which another 30 seconds and he'd have been dead.  He's done.  You got two minutes in the Bering Sea.  That's it.  Wow.  That's it.  I saw the episode where the boat just went sideways and they pretty much said everyone's fucked, but then they were able to right the boat or something.  Yeah.  Right?  That's how that one ended?  And then the first season I saw, which might have been the first season, a ship went down.  Yeah.  The ships went down.  Yeah, it's a big valley.  Yeah.  How big is the boat actually? 
[02:46:30]  It's a big valley.  Crab boats, you know, the smallest one I saw was called the Lucky Lady and that was about 42 feet.  And you've got crab boats at 130 feet.  Why don't they get like a 500-foot steel battleship type one that's supposed to withstand those waters, get six or seven of these dumb companies together and make one big company, and now you've got to destroyer hunting crabs with giant pots making a military operation.  Nobody gets hurt.  Why is that so difficult?  And we get our crabs.  Because then we don't get a great TV show, Jimmy.  That's a good point.  But, I mean, why don't they do that?  Well, what with the current conflict, the funds have been allocated towards other... 
[02:47:00]  Mike, you're on the boat.  Yeah.  There are some...  Why didn't you get hurt?  I'm Mike Rowe.  Are you like, you know...  I don't know.  No, you know what?  He's down with a cook.  Are you like, you know, cooking the stew?  What are you doing?  No, I don't do the boat.  The boat mother.  I go out.  Not one injury.  Not even a bruise.  Nothing.  I stay on Dutch Harbor.  I do.  I'm the guy in the helicopter.  He's a panic down below.  No, no.  I'm in a helicopter flying over the boats going, you know, down there, the men aboard. 
[02:47:30]  You know, right?  And this year we're taking a submarine and we're going to go under the ice flows.  Wow.  Oh, Russia.  And we're, for the first time, going to try and use this underwater photography to get  these giant pods of crab that actually migrate 600 feet down on the floor.  Is that how they get it as a pod, like a bunch of crabs go together?  Yeah.  That's the whole trick is to lower the pots into an area where there's these huge, just  like, yeah, an invasion of crabs.  And if you hit the right spots, you're going to make it. 
[02:48:00]  How do you know you pull it up?  They go broke.  Yeah.  Well, you gamble, right?  I mean, it's total Vegas gambling in the sense that, I mean, it's like the stock market, too.  You know, when you're riding a bad stock, it's a panic.  And when you drop your pots and you let them soak for maybe 24 hours, right, which is usually  enough time, you got to know, is this the time to pull them?  Because if you pull them too early, for all you know, the crabs were 15 feet from them,  you know?  And if you wait too long, you know, tick-tock, the season's going and going and going.  How do they figure that stuff out? 
[02:48:30]  They got radar and all that, or that doesn't help?  The radar won't work in that depth.  Oh, okay.  Good point.  You know...  Wait, how deep is it again?  400 to 600 feet.  Can't they just drop...  Oh, wow.  Why not just pull one up and see if it's got crabs in it?  They do it all the time.  It's called a tester pot, you know?  So they'll try and get a sense of it.  But in the end, it's like voodoo.  It's instinct.  You know, some of these guys have been at it 30, 35 years.  They have to wear the same underpants because they've been lucky.  They're all going commando.  There's no underpants.  So why would someone do this job? 
[02:49:00]  Good hands on a good boat.  Are they that desperate or their lives suck?  Have you got into their mindset of these people?  Oh, it's real simple, man.  It's 35 grand a week.  Good hand on a good boat.  Hitting it right can make a fortune.  So, Opie, you'd be taking quite a pay cut in order to...  Yeah.  Wait, the guys make 35 grand?  That's what the boat makes.  No, no.  The guys.  An individual hand.  Things have changed.  Congress, believe it or not, just passed something called...  The Crab Rationalization Act to change the way the season ran. 
[02:49:30]  Because up until this year, they were basically running these seasons with no declared end.  Fish and game would call the season when their projection said that the quotas got hit.  So you've got 150 boats in the fleet.  You've got 20 million pounds of crabs up for grabs.  You know, if you're in a race and you don't know where the finish line is, you just run balls out until somebody says stop.  That's why, like, by day four, day five, you've got a crew on a boat who hasn't slept for 96 hours.  All right?  They're going full steam ahead. 
[02:50:00]  It's so frigging dangerous.  I can't even tell you.  They don't know when they're going to call.  You don't know when, so you can't stop.  Well, Congress finally said, look, this is just insane.  We're going to take the quota system.  We're going to apply it to the individual boats.  So now you guys don't have to feel like you have to kill yourselves.  Well, these guys, they don't want any of it.  They're like, no.  No, we like this insanity.  We want to work like this.  You know, a century ago, coal mining towns would essentially become company towns, you know, like when the companies essentially own all the hardware stores, all the land, all the mining rights. 
[02:50:30]  Same kind of thing is happening in the fishing industry where the processors are basically laying claim to the entire line of work.  So they're buying the boats?  Yeah.  Hiring the people?  Yeah.  And so, you know, a lot of the snap is going out of the job.  And for the old salts, you know, they're going to lose their crack at big, giant paydays, but the job is going to get a little safer.  So, you know, depending on what side of the fence you're on, it's good news or bad news. 
[02:51:00]  Nah, those guys want big paydays.  They want money.  It must be hard to take a nice, comfortable shit on an awful crab boat.  Your pants are wet.  Well, it's actually...  Your boat's rocking.  They're constantly wet.  Yeah.  These people are just constantly wet.  It's really quite simple.  You just don't take your pants off.  Just let it ride.  You just work, you know, just stand there, crap your pants, pull in the thing.  Let it fall out your cubs and fly off the side of the boat.  I would not doubt that happened.  I squeezed a piece out once on the way to school.  Me and Bill D'Angelo, I was walking, and I hate to take dumps anywhere, but home, and I squeezed one, and a little piece rolled, and it rolled down my leg. 
[02:51:30]  And I went, hey, Bill, and I kicked my right leg like a rockette, and it flew out.  True story.  Whatever happened to Bill?  Bill's in South Jersey.  The crab fisherman.  Yeah.  Drove him right to the boat.  Wastewater treatment.  Yeah.  He never shook it.  I want to get a copy of that episode.  I'd like to watch that episode of the whole thing now that we're talking about, because I've seen moments where I remember that guy falling off.  It's really cool.  It really is.  You know what it is?  Each boat is its own story.  You would think, all right, you see one boat. 
[02:52:00]  I know what's going on in this one.  The different size boats, different characteristics of the people.  Some boats, like some of the smaller boats, have the crazier people on them.  Oh, yeah.  And then the bigger boats are run a little more, with a little more organization, a little more of a rational skipper.  Yeah.  And the small boats are just, you know, woo-hoo, we'll drop these pots, and then they've got to go back, pick more pots up, drop those, pick up their other pots, drop those off where they stored the other ones, 
[02:52:30]  because they don't have enough room on the boats for all these pots, that these huge ships have plenty of room for, you know, all.  They could just grab them all, run out, drop them, pick them up.  But the small boats, those guys are running constantly, nonstop, and it does.  It drives them crazy.  They're like generals planning an assault.  You know, I mean, it's very, very meticulous.  You know, there's only so much crab to go around.  And, you know, the cool thing is, I mean, everybody's doing the same basic horrific job.  So when things really go sideways, you know, your boat goes down, you've got an emergency, these guys will drop what they're doing, 
[02:53:00]  and every boat in the area will come, you know, which is cool.  But, you know, absent that, life on Dutch Harbor, oh, my God, the most notorious bar in the world.  It's called the Elbow Room.  And if you go online, at least it used to be, it was the most notorious bar in North America.  And the night I got there, I walked in about, I don't know, maybe an hour before there had been a hammer fight.  Which begs the question, you know, who the hell walks around with hammers, you know, apparently fishermen, you know. 
[02:53:30]  But, yeah, you know, women sweeping the teeth up off the floor.  Oh, shit.  So you got, you know, I mean, the stories of life in Dutch back in, like, the early 80s.  There's a great book by Spike Walker called Working on the Edge.  They call the edge the part of the crab boat where you're constantly leaned over, pulling the pots up.  Oh, my God.  Is that the most dangerous part?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you've got a boom crane behind you.  You've got this 800-pound pot coming up full of crab. 
[02:54:00]  You've got a guy who's, you know, maybe asleep, maybe stoned, who knows what, operating this thing.  And, you know, I mean, it's just pandemonium.  You know, and I say stoned.  Look, these guys are on the straight and narrow now, but you read Spike Walker's book.  Oh, my God.  You know, more drugs came through Dutch Harbor in the 80s than Miami.  Really?  Oh, it's Dutch Harbor's the biggest port, the biggest fishing port in North America.  Where's Dutch Harbor?  I know I should know that.  It's right smack in the middle of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. 
[02:54:30]  So, you know, if Alaska, you know, you can picture Alaska.  It's like a tail that comes off from the south and heads far west and then curls up toward Russia.  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Dutch Harbor was bombed in World War II before Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, but no one cared.  Nobody cared because Alaska wasn't a state.  Except for a few friends.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I mean, but there are bunkers there built into the cliffs.  There's, you know, if you ever saw, like, the Guns of Navarone, there are all these, you know, encampments there.  And, you know, if you were a soldier in the 40s, you know, in the army and you got sent to Dutch. 
[02:55:00]  That means you did something where you really fucked up.  It's Siberia.  Let me forget.  The stories you were saying about how they all come to each other's aid when there's problems and they'll do anything.  It's highly competitive when everybody's in good shape, but they'll do anything for each other if they're in trouble.  But they're also known for playing some jokes.  I saw one of the episodes where they welded shut another ship's pot, one of their pots, welded it shut and put, what, a bra in there? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  And just another one put all their garbage?  Sure.  Took the ship's garbage, threw it in their big pot, and welded the thing shut and then re-dropped it.  So now you see the other ship comes up and they're all psyched.  All right, come on, we're going to see some crab.  Let's go.  Because they get all psyched on that first pot.  Heavy it is, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  And, you know, they get the guy, he throws the line, they hook it, they put it on the spool, the pulley. 
[02:56:00]  It comes up and they're just looking like, all right, who's the son of a bitch is that?  And then they had to pull a gag on them.  So, I mean, they're riding 40-foot frozen seas playing jokes on each other.  Wait, they leave the pots and then go somewhere else?  They don't just hang out all the pots?  No, you leave.  Hey, you know, why don't you just steal each other's pots?  Booze.  No, you still, I mean, honestly, they're, now you're talking war.  You're talking murder.  Yeah, you're going to kill.  Yeah, that's like the old hanging offense for stealing a horse.  It's wrestling.  That's still in play. 
[02:56:30]  That is.  You'd be killed.  You were dumb lobsters in Long Island Sound, man.  You don't mess with those freaking pots.  They'll kill you.  So, we just did a lobster show for Dirty Jobs up in down east Maine.  And, you know, same kind of mentality.  Same kind of work.  You know, slightly smaller scale.  Thanks, Kenny.  Let me ask you a question, though.  When you, when you're, when they drop a pot, right, and they put the dumb crab just waltz into it?  Do they, how do they tip it?  Do they tip it one way?  Why don't the crabs just go out?  We're in something.  It's like a roach motel.  No.  They're shaped like roach motels where you could get in, but you can't get out because of the shape of the entrance. 
[02:57:00]  And they got Mozart music.  Yeah.  The crabs love Mozart.  Love the Mozart.  Why can't you get out?  Yeah.  It's one of those things where it's like a ramp.  And they walk up it and then fall into the pot.  And now you can't get back up to walk out.  They're not bright.  They're crabs.  Yeah, they're fucking crabs.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm acting like the brain.  I'm acting like the men's students waltzing and falling.  Their eyes are like, whoo.  They're all over the place.  They don't even know what they're looking at.  They're pointing to the exit with that claw.  Over there, idiot. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  We came in that way.  They're all just crawling over each other like dopes.  That's it.  Plus, there's a big piece of rotten cod hanging there.  So they never leave the food.  They'll just keep eating.  They'll just suck the marrow out of the bone.  That's a small crab pot right there.  Yeah, that's nothing.  Let me see.  Hey, Katie, Jersey.  Opie, Anthony, Merton, always a pleasure.  Mike, hello.  Hello.  I just have a quick question regarding the Shark Week episode that you recorded, and you  did the sub-episode for Dirty Jobs, and you wanted to go play with the monkeys. 
[02:58:00]  Was there any play of that episode that was cut out that you guys didn't show us?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Monkeys.  When we were in...  Evil monkeys, I'm hearing?  Bad monkeys.  Oh, yes.  That was evil monkeys.  Bad monkey.  We were in...  Crazy lady, too.  Yeah, her name is Dawn McGowan, and we were actually in Cape Town shooting Shark Week.  The weather got ugly, and we needed something to do.  Had a few days to kill, so we heard word of this woman in KwaZulu-Natal, which is, you  know, picture nowhere, and then, like, you know, times 10. 
[02:58:30]  It's like a few hours in the bush out of, not John, but Durban.  Durban's a resort town.  Anyhow, look, it's in the middle of nowhere.  There's a woman who cares for troubled monkeys.  That's all we know.  Troubled monkeys?  It's a rehab center for monkeys.  Thank you.  Okay.  So, we're like, okay, crazy woman, monkeys, micro, dirty jobs, you know, we can get something  here.  Yeah.  So, crew and I fly to Durban. 
[02:59:00]  From Durban, we drive and drive and drive and get to this place, and, you know, I don't  know if you remember Doctari or, like, any of these old Wild Kingdom shows.  Sure.  Forget it.  This is the real deal.  This woman and her boyfriend of 29 years live in this, I'm going to call it a house, all  right, but in the house are monkeys, and the monkeys are lame and mangled, all jacked up,  one's crazier than the next.  They're crapping everywhere. 
[02:59:30]  They're masturbating everywhere.  They're dragging their nasty bottoms across the rug like, you know, a dog with an itchy  hiney.  How many about it?  Who knows, man?  They move so quick.  Two, 20, 50.  You wouldn't even know.  I don't know.  Two or 20.  We're there.  As soon as we pull up, a monkey jumps off the roof, lands on my head, and cuts my face  open.  On purpose or by accident?  Like, just put him to the landing.  So, it's a monkey.  It's hard to know what really drives the monkey, but-  That is a hysterical question.  Well, I mean, no, no.  On purpose or on accident?  I mean, did he jump on you, or did he swipe at you, or did he just, when he was landing, 
[03:00:00]  hit you by accident?  Yeah.  You know what?  It's both.  Monkeys have a really strict sort of hierarchy in their troops, you know?  And this guy was some alpha, subordinate, dominant male thing, or whatever.  He's like China, basically, right?  So, the thing jumps on me.  He's just freaking out because people are around.  So, I'm bleeding from my face, you know, and we're just unloading gear.  Remember, this monkey's wigging out.  His name was Patty, by the way, if it matters. 
[03:00:30]  Hi, I'm a monkey.  Patty jumps on Georgia, one of our camera girls.  Cuts her head.  Now, we're like, okay, enough about-  Everybody says, monkey's got a knife.  Drop the gear, get in the house.  So, we're standing in the house, and we're talking, you know, about, okay, this is what  we need to do.  Obviously, we've got to get the story, but look, let's just watch each other's backs.  While we're talking, the screen door opens, and I glance over, don't see anything  at all.  It's just, it's kind of, I figure it's the wind.  Then there's a gray dart that just goes streaking across the floor. 
[03:01:00]  Then there's screaming.  Then the door closed.  This monkey had run in, bit my sound man, Chris, in the calf to the bone, 31 stitches.  Laid him open, okay?  Monkey's out the door before the door can even close.  Chris is literally sitting there in a puddle of blood.  And now it's, now it's bad.  You can't drive in this part of South Africa at night.  Forget it.  You know, bandits are crazy on the roads, and the roads are hazardous.  We are, we are scuh rude. 
[03:01:30]  We're in the middle of KwaZulu-Natal.  There's a crazy monkey.  Now, we're thinking AIDS, rabies.  Yeah.  I mean, all of it, right?  Who fucked the monkey?  Who didn't?  We're in the middle of nowhere, dude.  We're in the middle of nowhere.  Man gets lonely in the bush.  Where are the people that own the house?  Her name is Dawn, and she's saying, don't worry, my son.  It happens all the time.  What we're going to do, don't stitch the wound.  And if you stitch it up, it's going to be very bad, because all the contagion will be trapped inside. 
[03:02:00]  So just let it bleed.  Let the badness bleed out.  Oh, my God.  And we're just like, what in the hell are you saying?  Do they bite her, too, or no?  She's covered with scars.  Her boyfriend is covered with scars.  The monkeys run the entire asylum.  Everybody there.  So really, now, my buddy Eddie Barbini is shooting this right now.  When he saw the footage, he was like, dudes, this isn't a story.  This is a mission.  This is kind of an adventure. 
[03:02:30]  And that's when Dirty Jobs took a turn, because I had a camera, and I just started shooting everything.  So we get back, and we look at the footage, and Eddie and I are like, what the hell are we going to do with this?  And basically, we just said, well, we'll just tell the truth.  This is what happened.  We can't.  This is what happened on our little day off.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to make the most of the network's money.  You know, we're down here for Shark Week.  We're going to go grab a quick, dirty job.  We're going to be heroes.  We were very, you know, the three of us are bleeding. 
[03:03:00]  You may have invented Monkey Week.  Imagine that, the horror.  If you thought the sharks were scary.  Yes.  Yeah, so anyway, that's a long answer to her question, but we shot stuff.  I mean, we had breakdowns within the crew.  You shot that fucking monkey is what you should have shot.  Honestly, Anthony, if I had got my hands on it, I'd have snapped his little verbit neck.  Well, do they, now do the people that run the thing, like the couple, do the monkeys stop  biting them after they realize they're feeding them and treating them okay?  No.  No.  That's the thing.  You've got 20 monkeys who they're sort of rehabilitating. 
[03:03:30]  You know, there are a lot of orphan monkeys.  Hunters will shoot a monkey on sight because they're like rats to us.  They're everywhere.  But then you've got truly wild monkeys who also live on the roof of the house.  Because we're in the jungle.  We're in the bush, basically.  So, you've got the indigenous monkeys who are just kind of there because that's where  they've always been.  And then you've got the sick monkeys who are in the house.  And then you've got us who are just, you know, trying to find a place to...  Invading their space. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Do they have that many monkeys down there?  You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a monkey.  Do they shit in the house and throw it in the house?  Sure they do.  Why would they have monkeys shit in the house?  What's the matter with people?  They're living there.  They're crazy.  Look, the single biggest misconception I can say to who's ever listening is, you know,  whatever you know about monkeys is wrong.  It ain't Lance Link.  It ain't Curious George.  They're not wearing diapers, walking around, juggling.  Cover rolls in an engineer hat.  No.  That's right.  The cutest thing.  Oh, they're adorable.  No.  Nothing cuter.  They've got bright red asses and erections. 
[03:04:30]  And they're running around the house crapping indiscriminately.  All right?  These things.  Jimmy pays for that.  Did the house...  Yeah.  Did they have dresses?  I'm sure we could work something out.  Hey, did the house stink?  No, man.  It smelled like flowers.  Really bad.  It was hot.  Where do the people go?  They have a panic room or something they could go into?  No.  They don't panic.  They like it.  They like it.  They're there.  They are there at the monkeys.  I don't think anyone's getting an understanding at how crazy these people are. 
[03:05:00]  Do they have a...  Wait, wait, wait.  What about running water and a toilet?  Cable?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Cable, computers.  No.  They got a toilet.  The water comes from the...  I sat on the couch and I itched for a month and a half.  There are things in the couch.  Oh, wow.  There are things in the couch.  Vermin.  Yeah, sure.  And also probably like lice and bugs.  Oh, yeah.  Everywhere.  You know crazy cat people?  Yeah.  All right.  Crazy monkey people.  Just cross out cats, put in monkey.  Crazy monkey people.  They're out there.  They're out there.  Wow.  Are they just having sex all over the place? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bunch of fucking monkeys.  Dude, it's like a German porno.  It's just poo and fluids and fur.  Wait, what do you do if you own a house and you want to go somewhere and the monkeys are  being territorial in your living room?  You forget about your security deposit, man, because it's gone.  Can I see video of this?  Pictures?  Anything on the web?  What's up?  Well, we put it on.  I mean, normally each episode of Dirty Jobs is one.  You do YouTube or they don't allow you to do that?  Eddie, do we have anything on YouTube? 
[03:06:00]  I don't think so, no.  They pull that.  No, no.  You got to watch.  It's a, I mean, normally Dirty Jobs is three jobs in one show.  This was one.  We just took one hour and just aired as much.  Are these seasons like coming out on DVD?  Yeah.  You guys doing that on Discovery?  Yeah.  But, you know, it's kind of lame, to be honest with you.  All they're doing is running, you know, the episodes that ran without commercials.  There's no real commentary.  What we're trying to do now, we're actually talking about going back and taking some of  these early jobs and expanding them into a half hour and adding new commentary and stuff. 
[03:06:30]  Because when we shoot, I mean, we got three cameramen.  We'll come back with 35 hours of tape for a 15 or 18 minute segment, you know.  So the stuff we leave on the floor would break your heart, you know.  And for fans of the show, we're like, you know, I don't want to do this in a DVD.  I want to repurpose it and put it on the air so we can see, you know, what it took to actually  make this.  Because all those, for as screwed up as that monkey thing was, I got the same story two 
[03:07:00]  weeks ago in Tennessee running a mule team trying to get logs out of the woods.  The stuff that went wrong and the danger, I mean, logging is, you talk about crabbing?  Logging is right there behind it.  Yeah.  We were all just lucky to get out of there with all our moving parts, you know.  And it's just, I don't know, man.  The whole thing is turning into a very, very unfortunate vacation.  It sounds like you're reaching that, how can we top this point in the show?  And that's when things get dangerous. 
[03:07:30]  Dude, I mean, I got bit by a shark last year, right?  Nice.  Three of them.  I don't know what to do this year.  Yeah, what are you doing now?  I mean, you know, we look at each other and we're like, well.  No, did that one.  Did that one.  Snakes, did it.  Ostrich, did it.  Monkey, yeah.  Yeah, bit me.  Shock jocks?  Shark, yeah, bit me.  You did the shock jocks?  Yeah.  What's the shock jocks?  We should be, we could be dangerous when we're not in bed.  Oh, you guys?  Yeah, we're very dangerous.  Let your calf open to the bone.  I know a dangerous job you could do.  How about you guys come in and film whoever has to clean my sheets after a breakup? 
[03:08:00]  Oh my God, that's the rubber ones.  Yeah, for the week following the breakup, whoever has to squeeze the DNA out of my fucking comforter.  Dude, just buy rubber.  It's so much simpler.  People are laughing just because you said logs and mules.  Our fucking audience are despicable.  We're getting the great stories out of Mike and all they care about is he said logs.  He said logs and mules.  People are hysterical.  All right, why don't we take a break? 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Let me see if Eric could stay there.  Eric.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  We'll go to you after the break, okay?  Okay.  Just stay there, please, for us.  All right.  And after the break...  I thought this was sadly.  Yeah, we take breaks, though, just to get in, like...  So he could piss or...  As long as we have to pee and stuff.  Oh, right, right, right.  Good, man.  Mike, we've been talking for an hour straight.  I've been peeing for the last five minutes.  Yeah, we left CBS like an hour ago.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Where does the time go?  I don't know.  Hey, wait.  Did you pet any of the monkeys?  Some of them had to be probably kind of cool and grateful. 
[03:09:00]  I mean, they aren't fucking primates.  All the monkeys sucked.  No, I'm doing a couple.  All right.  A monkey crawls up to you.  There's pussy discharge in both of his eyes.  There's blood on his teeth.  And by the way, they have mouths like German shepherds, okay?  It's partially erect, and its feet are covered with its own feces.  All right.  I don't want to pet him.  You've got to fix that partial part first.  China, get in here.  Wait.  You've got to work a little harder, Mike. 
[03:09:30]  What's wrong with you?  Oh, that's horrible.  Get in there.  Get the job done.  But this is the misconception that we all have.  Well, these are not gorillas, right?  These are not like silverbacks.  No, these are vervet monkeys.  Are these the ones in the trees and shit that are fucking just douchebags?  No, those are howlers.  Punch up a vervet monkey there.  Man, let's see what vervet monkey looks like.  Gorillas seem to be like, I mean, look, I've seen all the footage and stuff, some of it.  Jane Goodall and all that stuff.  They seem to be a little bit more understanding of your role as there as a human. 
[03:10:00]  And there seems to be a better understanding between people and gorillas than monkeys.  Right up to the point where they pull your arms off and beat you over the head.  Do they do that, though?  A gorilla, they're so strong.  Orangutans are so strong.  That's the cutest thing.  Oh, how awful does that look?  That could that do to you?  That is a vervet monkey.  Oh, my God.  He spilled his coffee.  He's spilling his coffee.  He's freaking out looking at the picture of the vervet monkey.  There's the son of a bitch.  There's the son of a bitch.  The crime of that picture is that its mouth isn't open.  Right. 
[03:10:30]  I've seen those monkeys yawn, and their teeth are giant.  Yep.  That fucking thing stinks.  Huge canine.  And look, you can see his red ass under that tail.  How big is that?  They're trying to camouflage that ass.  Look.  Yep, that's exactly what it is.  It's as red as that hooker that came over Jimmy's house last night when she left.  How big is that vervet monkey?  They can go about maybe three feet.  They're not huge.  Oh, all right.  Oh, that's a small little thing?  They don't have to be.  You've got quantity.  And they're fast, dude.  They are.  I mean, like crazy fast. 
[03:11:00]  Like blinding fast.  But some of them, do the people just love them that live with them?  I mean, they must love the animals.  Love them.  Do they eat them?  Do the monkeys have to know who they are?  Again, the monkeys, they're not retarded.  They have to start recognizing.  Oh, no.  I mean, Dawn, the woman who runs the joint, I mean, she is the dominant female.  You know, I mean, she's, I mean, literally the small monkeys, I'm sure they look to her  as, you know, as one of their own.  Yeah, sure.  Plus, she's covered in her own poo.  So, you know, she was throwing her own feces. 
[03:11:30]  Did the monkeys try to bite the older guy?  Why am I asking five-year-old boy questions?  God almighty, am I irritating?  Did the monkeys talk and did...  Fucking zero.  Did you pet it?  Oh, I really am an asshole.  Fluffy?  What was his name?  What was the monkey's name?  I don't deserve a relationship.  I should be prostituting.  Fucking no Pilates doing nothing.  It's a breakup, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's awful.  It's my fault.  It's her fault.  I'm looking back at my part.  I was also a big part of it. 
[03:12:00]  It hits you again.  Oh, don't you start blaming yourself.  I'm part of it.  I'm part of it.  Not all of it, but I'm part of it.  You little fervent monkey.  Sorry, I can't help it.  My feet were covered in shit.  Jimmy forgets for about...  You were partially red.  Yes.  I bit a clit.  My asshole was red.  Jimmy forgets for about 15 or 20 minutes, and then, you know, he gets...  Comes back.  You're on the roller coaster, man.  You're on the roller coaster.  Not your fault.  Any advice for Jimmy?  You must be this tall to get on the ride, and you are.  And you are.  Just hang on, dude. 
[03:12:30]  What good advice.  Yeah, just hang on.  You're just hanging on.  It's going to be some ups and downs.  Hey, you know what?  Ride will be over soon.  It's supposed to hurt.  I know.  I know.  You break your arm.  Mazarin said it best.  Love hurts.  Love hurts, dude.  You know, you break your arm.  Look, you put it in a cast.  You've got to give it time.  It's going to heal.  And it's going to be a pain in the ass for a while.  Jesus.  He actually had an answer for that.  I'd like to lay her back and fucking put on a catcher's mitt and go noodling and see  if I pull out any fucking condoms from two days ago.  See if she's been banging anybody.  I'm sure she has been.  I'm sure she's fucking thrilled that the gun is gone. 
[03:13:00]  A catcher's mitt, dude?  Yeah, just because it's big and the greater.  What about a batting glove?  What about a surgical mitt?  Catcher's mitt would be worse going in.  That's why nobody wants a catcher's mitt in their pussy.  Believe me.  You don't think she's already dating, dude.  I'm sure she's fucking already.  They always do.  Do they always?  Of course they do.  Is it the first thing they do?  Because they can.  Oh, wow.  A little too real.  Why don't we...  Jesus.  Bitches.  Yeah.  Is she listening now?  No.  Are you sure? 
[03:13:30]  Positive.  I wouldn't give a fuck she was, but she's not.  She's not.  Why would she?  That'd be supportive.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Jenny's throwing his own feces around the room.  Consider the monkey.  Yes.  You better watch out.  He'll bite your calf.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  We got a girl that was...  I don't know.  She wants to talk about something.  Aloise.  Or Aloise.  Aloise.  What's your name there, Charlotte girl? 
[03:14:00]  Hi.  I'm Aloise.  I'm originally from South Africa, and I watched the show that you did with the monkey woman.  Yeah.  She is crazy, but the monkeys are crazy, too, because they used to come into our kitchen  and steal our food off the counters.  Yeah.  They're dangerous.  They're absolutely crazy.  I got a question.  Yeah.  I got a question for you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, good question.  I'm waiting for the question. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, that was a good one.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 36.  36?  So you still remember the good old days, huh?  No.  I did not grow up like that at all.  Oh, you didn't?  Hey, do the monkeys ever bite you?  No, they didn't, but they did take a cat of ours, and we never saw the cat again, so...  They took your cat.  Your cat?  Yeah.  When a cat and a monkey face off, it's a bad day to be a cat.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:15:00]  Monkeys will fucking wreck it.  Monkeys just kicking cat ass, right?  Of course they are.  Cat with that stupid hissing monkey, a clutch face.  All right.  On purpose or on accident?  I know.  Did the monkey mean to hurt you, or was he being friendly and bringing you ice cream?  I'm going to just smear their own shit in my face.  Fucking question.  What time is it?  What time is it?  Oh, my God.  That's what I'm going to say.  Love you, sir.  Love Jim Norton.  Mr. Unlucky Louie.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Yeah, Lucky Louie.  That's another thing I need to mention.  You really need that.  Thank you.  You really need to mention that.  Another fucking horrifying aspect of my life. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, boy.  I can't even get a fucking show on the air for more than 12 episodes for a bag of shit.  Yeah.  That was bad.  It makes me feel so bad for him.  No, you shouldn't.  I'm very lucky.  He's doing so well.  He's doing great.  Dr. Phil.  Remember what Dr. Phil said.  That's right.  Mike, have you ever heard that?  What's a Dr. Phil say?  Well, when...  Can we just play it?  We should go some other time.  It's just...  You don't want to hear that today?  I don't care.  You can.  You sure?  I don't want to...  No, I won't bother.  You know.  Because Mike is kind of enjoying your misery. 
[03:16:00]  I just want to keep going for a while.  Dude, my heart is actually breaking.  It kills me.  But Dr. Phil has...  That's my own fault.  Believe me.  I'm a fucking self-indulgent pig of a human.  I brought it on myself.  All of it.  No, you...  Now it's all of it.  Now it's all of it.  No, no.  It's the truth.  It's the truth.  Self-will run riot, man.  I know what it is.  Now it's all of it.  Absolutely.  No, it's not.  Most of it, yeah.  No, it's not.  I can't feel sorry for myself.  It's true.  Yeah, but dude, I mean, you got to like yourself at the same time.  In the end, you're just left with you.  So it does you no good to do a total teardown.  You got to have something that, you know, you look back in the mirror, it's got to be 
[03:16:30]  something, you know.  Reminds me of a little poem I once read called The Man in the Glass.  Yeah?  Cool.  Uh-huh.  It's all about you have to like the man in the glass.  And the glass...  Would be a mirror.  A mirror.  That's right.  I thought it was a shot of whiskey.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Because I love The Man in the Glass.  The Man in the Glass, as you tip up the shot glass and look at him through the bottom of  the shot glass.  I like your booze lot.  Yeah.  How about The Man in the Boat?  We could talk to Shynan about that.  I certainly like that.  Dude.  The Man in the Boat has a huge water head.  He's a man, baby. 
[03:17:00]  There's a fucking crab pot she has in her boat.  Hey, you want to hear this?  It's up to you, Jimmy.  Yeah, if you want to play going into breaks, I'm going to go take a leak and fucking, you  know, maybe just see if there's a hole in the fucking bathroom stalls.  I can at least meet somebody.  Mike, this is one of my favorite things.  It's Jim's actual mom calling and leaving a message.  Jim's loving mom.  Yeah.  And this is a typical loving mother calling her son out of concern, compassion, and it's  just a typical mother.  And know why this is a good thing to play today? 
[03:17:30]  Because Jim ended up following his mom's advice for a very long time.  I absolutely did.  I didn't realize it was mother's advice that I did follow.  When this call came in, you didn't start your workout program.  That's right.  You didn't start your boxing.  You didn't start your dating.  Right?  You weren't hitting the gym yet.  No.  When did this call come?  I did a little bit before last year, and then I got fatter again when I was doing Lucky  Louie because there's food at craft services, man.  You just can't.  And the woman who ran craft services was just a fucking manatee. 
[03:18:00]  Just a, just a, but you want to talk about covering up some type of molestation.  Boy, did she do it.  Six pound cakes at a time.  She couldn't stop shoveling food into that fucking fat hole.  You called her a manatee.  She was awful.  You don't know how huge that is.  That's a tremendous thing.  Exactly.  She had slight propeller marks on her back.  She did.  You had to barnacle scrape it before she'd bring your coffee in the morning.  Fucking monster.  But, um.  Oh, you know what, though?  She was a good gal, and she had a good heart.  That's what really counted. 
[03:18:30]  She took care of us.  She bought us good food.  Fat cunt couldn't stop eating.  The song cheers up, Jimmy.  The food was really good, so.  It cheers up, Jimmy, but we can't play it all day because it's karma, karma, whatever.  It's a karma, karma.  I lost interest.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't care.  All right.  Here is a two-sexual mom.  Well, Tom, I was talking about prostitution on the air.  I tend to, you know, I exaggerate a little bit.  And my exaggerations are basically downplays.  Like, you know.  Understating it. 
[03:19:00]  And my mother heard a message, heard this, and called me and left me a message, and I just saved it.  It's a concern, Mom.  Are we done?  Hi, sweetheart.  It's Mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better. 
[03:19:30]  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother. 
[03:20:00]  And I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you.  And I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, my favorite part, too, Mike. 
[03:20:30]  Isn't that the sweetest thing?  Well, now they do.  Isn't that darling, though?  Yeah.  His mom called me like that.  That's why we have Mother's Day.  I mean, honestly.  You've got to put yourself in her shoes.  She had to make that call.  Yeah.  Otherwise, your name.  What goes through her head?  I mean, as a mother, you can't enable.  You've got to do something.  You've got to say something about that lifestyle.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  But the whole, you know, I'm not into it.  I like the end.  It's almost like she felt threatened at the end of that call. 
[03:21:00]  Like, I'm not into it.  I'm sorry.  Don't hit me.  I didn't realize she was going to stay in the air.  I would have waited.  Dude, she's fantastic.  Yeah, she's very nice.  My mother's very nice.  What's her name?  It's the sweetest call.  That's great.  Yeah, she is the sweetest lady we'll ever meet.  The way she was like, you know, I love you, and it's so, you know, I hope we see you for  Christmas and everything.  Just what a sweetheart.  Yeah, very nice parents.  I took her advice, too.  I took her advice.  I didn't mean to at the time, but all of a sudden I did.  I went to the gym and all this stuff, and, you know, dated a little bit here and there.  And this girl was the girl I broke up with. 
[03:21:30]  We broke up.  It was mutual.  We didn't know and dumped her with her.  She was one of my best friends for three years.  I never even jerked off to her.  I never thought about fucking her.  Really?  No, I loved her.  I didn't think about fucking her.  That's something.  I'm not sure that's love, dude.  Yeah.  No, for me it is because I'm such a twisted sexually.  Like, I don't know when I'm horny and when I'm not.  It's like an overeater.  You don't know when you're hungry.  You just shove food in your face.  I don't know when I want to fuck, when I don't want to fuck.  I have no idea what it's like to be connected with love sexually.  For me, sex is dirty.  You know, it's fucking, you know, you don't connect. 
[03:22:00]  I felt guilty.  Is that abnormal when you're making love to someone you care about to just go, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You sure you didn't see the monkey show?  Wow.  Getting a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That's an interesting thing.  The whole love-sex thing.  You can't put the two together because you've had such degenerate sex for so many years.  But I can have sex with somebody I like, but it's very hard. 
[03:22:30]  With her, it was hard.  Like, we had really good oral sex.  It was just kind of hard to get into the intercourse.  There was something too intimate about that for me.  It was hard.  It was getting to a point where I could have, but it was just fucking very difficult.  Have you ever felt that with a girl where you feel love and intercourse is fine?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it always takes a little while.  It's just a weird adjustment for me to find that balance.  It's a very weird adjustment.  It's usually with girlfriends.  I can like you and have good sex with you, but once I get past that point...  I can like you.  That's great.  Like where I'm...  Go out to the ball game. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Give me a blowjob.  Yeah, that's right.  I can fucking buy a hot dog.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll fuck you from the back and not want to choke you if that constitutes liking.  You know?  Well...  That's...  You know?  Wow.  That's why people write songs and poetry, I think.  He always has the right things.  Yeah, he does.  You make me not want to choke you.  Isn't it romantic?  That is sweet.  Oh, that's right.  He does a little opera.  Oh, yeah.  I did forget that, too.  Can you do a little opera going into break? 
[03:23:30]  And then we're going to talk about what you had to do to cows.  And also this great story coming from Channel 11.  Sex allergy story.  It's hilarious.  Sure.  Big laughs on the way.  Can you do a little opera?  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.  Nobody knows Jimmy's sorrow.  Nobody knows the trouble he's seen.  Glory, hallelujah. 
[03:24:00]  Wow.  Holy crap.  Nice.  Is Club Soda Kenny here?  Jesus.  We've got to get a duet with Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  Is he here?  Can we leave?  Because something has to destroy that.  Where is that horse's ass?  Did you do a duet with Club Soda Kenny?  Yeah, sure, man.  He does Secret Asian Man.  It's just terrific.  There's a man who lives a life of danger.  Well, let's hear your version.  Just the...  Oh, who did the original?  You can just do the hook. 
[03:24:30]  I don't even remember who did that.  Do we have Kenny?  You can do that acapella.  Yeah, Kenny's Secret Asian Man.  That's the toughest secret.  All right, look.  We'll set it up after the break so you can hear Kenny.  They've given you a number and took away your name, right?  Something like that.  Take it away, your name.  Well, you should let him sing it before he hears Kenny's version, and this way you can  make the comparison of the two, because Kenny had no comparison to go with.  Yeah.  Write down what Kenny sang, and then we'll have Mike sing it first.  Mike knows the song, so he'll probably recognize the...  I just need the lyrics.  Yeah, give me the lyrics.  I'll fake it.  I know the tune. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Yeah, get him the lyrics.  All right.  We've got lots to do after the break.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, Hockey, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is...  Fuck my shit, because y'all ain't give me no money.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, Cash Up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch. 
[03:25:30]  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Fuck you, bitch.  Hi, the O.B. and Anthony Radio Program.  We're back on the radio.  We have Mike Rowe in studio, and Nathaniel's handing things out.  The excitement is mounting.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm good.  You know how to bring a show back.  I certainly do.  Professionalism.  I got...  We just talked about the bridge with Mike Rowe, because he's from that area. 
[03:26:00]  Or living there, or whatever.  Yeah.  No, from Baltimore.  But I literally, right out my front window, I can see the Golden Gate now.  You know, and one of the first things I noticed when I moved up there was, you know, obviously,  people throw themselves off the thing, you know, once a week or so, and nobody ever reports  it.  You know, you always see these Coast Guard helicopters flying around, and whenever you  see that, it means they're plucking somebody out.  You turn on the news, there's nothing.  Oh, that's the world's deadliest catch, huh? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, you're not kidding.  Oh, gosh.  Well, grab bait.  Pull up another one.  Wow, they don't report it, though, huh?  Very, very rarely.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  I wonder why.  They just hose it down and move on.  Too negative.  Yeah.  Too negative.  A lot of positive, fun news they just want.  Well, it's kind of like the Disney thing we talk about all the time.  I mean, you know, kids are dying down at Disney, and they try to just hose it down and  open up the ride as fast as possible.  Kids, adults, whatever, yeah, they just hose it down.  It's a small world.  Yeah.  Hey, get that music cranker back up. 
[03:27:00]  Come on.  Sure.  Get the emergency crews out of here.  I want the smell of cinnamon, sugar, and roasted nuts in the air.  Right.  That vomit off the roller coaster.  Hey, Eric, he's been waiting on hold for a very long time.  Eric, what's up?  Very long time.  One thing for Mike, one thing for Opie.  Mike, I became a big fan of you after the first time you were on the program and watched  the show repeatedly.  Tell me how you really felt after you inseminated the sow.  You know, kind of relieved, and I'll tell you why. 
[03:27:30]  What you didn't see was me extracting the semen from the boar.  We showed part of it, but, you know, a pig's penis looks remarkably similar to its tail.  It's long, and it's curly.  Ew.  It's sort of like Jimmy's.  Yes, pigs have cleaner mules than I've seen them do lately.  Oh, boy.  But, Eric, man, it's long, you know, and it's very difficult to handle, and, you know, 
[03:28:00]  manipulating this thing is, you know, it's a...  You actually have to manipulate that thing.  Why don't we just say it?  You have to jerk a pig off.  You've got to jerk a pig off to get the sample.  You look pretty relaxed at the end of that thing.  Did you have a cigarette?  I had a cigar, actually.  I mean, the...  A twisted cigarette.  If you haven't seen it, you get a catheter, and you put the semen in it from the boar,  and then you sit backwards on this 600-pound sow, and you sit on her. 
[03:28:30]  She...  It's called estrus.  They go into a...  Standing is the colloquial term.  You know, they basically freeze up, which they do when the pig mounts her from behind.  So you have to sit on this thing to simulate the weight of the boar.  And they stop moving?  They stop moving, right.  And you take the catheter, and you slip it in through...  First of all, you have to wipe the poo off the vulva, you know, because...  Well, yeah, you don't want anything obstructing the vulva.  And it's got to involve poo in some way.  And she's got shit on her box. 
[03:29:00]  She is a pig.  You gotta love her.  So you're sitting on a pig, and you're putting the semen in, you know, backwards.  It's...  Yeah, Eric, you're right.  I felt odd.  Oddly dirty, yet liberated.  If we needed a boar's semen, we'd just jerk off Steve C.  All right, we got the secret Asian man for Mike Rowe.  He likes his opera.  What can I tell you?  Trained.  Professionally, right?  So who's... 
[03:29:30]  You know, actually, no.  I couldn't get in AFTRA or SAG back in 79 and 80.  You needed some work before you could get in, but you couldn't get in unless you had to  work.  Right.  But if you get in the opera, you join AGMA.  AGMA.  American Guild of Musical Artists, right?  Then you can buy your membership in SAG or AFTRA.  They're all sister unions.  Yeah.  So it was like this loophole.  I was like this saloon singer, you know, in high school.  So I like learned a couple arias and I went down and I just kind of crashed an audition. 
[03:30:00]  And the next thing I know, I'm like, you know, carrying a spear and singing, but I'm a total  imposter.  You know, I don't know what I'm doing.  You're a fraud.  I'm a total fake and they hire me.  And, you know, so I figured, well, you know, it's a great place to meet girls, first of  all.  And it's also really cool music if you give it time, you know.  So after a season, I figured, you know, I'm done with this thing.  There's not enough time in the world.  Dude, you're dressed like a pirate, okay?  It's intermission.  All the girls are dressed like, you know, Vikings, all right? 
[03:30:30]  And you're just kind of walking around.  And you got an hour and a half to kill.  Yeah.  You know, you're young, got the whole life ahead of you.  There's an orchestra playing, you know, this amazing music.  And, you know, they're the catwalks up there.  Keep trying to sell it.  It's still opera.  I don't know.  There's one opera song I like a lot, though.  They play it on the Sopranos.  I can't remember what it sounds like, but I like it every time it comes on.  I wish I could fucking mimic some of it.  Oh, so...  That's not good.  Can you give us, like...  Oh, so la mio?  Can you give us opera for dummies? 
[03:31:00]  How's that go?  Opera for dummies?  Actually, I mean...  Not with that one.  Wait, oh, so la mio.  How's oh, so la mio?  That's Elvis Presley's ripoff of It's Now or Never.  It's the same tune.  Oh, my God.  It's now or never.  Come hold me tight.  Oh, so la mio.  Right?  That's the same.  I just sang that in a rowboat in 800,000 gallons of liquid cow diarrhea on a dairy farm up in Connecticut.  800,000 gallons of cow shit? 
[03:31:30]  Why do they save it?  The guy heats his house with it, and he also makes these flower pots out of cow crap now.  So you can buy a biodegradable pot made completely out of crap, put your chrysanthemums in it, and then bury the thing in the backyard, and the pot dissolves.  Fertilizes it.  Fertilizes it.  Yeah, the guy's a genius.  How does he heat his house off of the cow shit?  Well, he basically has created a digester in his backyard, which is this like crazy Rube Goldberg sort of device, you know, and he collects all the cow crap, and it goes into a series of composters where you basically make an aerobic, then you make an anaerobic. 
[03:32:00]  You take all the stink and moisture out of it, and then you work with it like clay.  I mean, it's brilliant.  And if you burn it, if you burn the methane off, you can essentially heat anything.  He basically is lighting cow farts on fire and using it to heat his home.  Does it stink?  No.  No, it's incredibly efficient, actually.  I mean, it stinks, and the early process is unspeakable. 
[03:32:30]  And this lagoon, I mean, literally 800,000 gallons.  I'm not kidding.  It's this giant brown pool.  I mean, it's literally, I mean, you are up shit creek for real, you know, and I had to paddle across the thing to do some basic maintenance on the side.  So it's a, I mean, it's funny you mention that song, because as I'm paddling the boat through this giant river of crap, I'm, you know, singing this thing.  Well, it must have been like a gondolier from Hill.  Yeah.  Was there flies there?  Yeah.  What's that?  Was there flies around?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's another innocent little question from Don Jimmy. 
[03:33:00]  Were there flies?  Did it smell, mister?  A lake of shit.  Did you pet them?  Yeah.  Were the monkeys there?  No, that was the other story.  You know how kids can't distinguish between two stories you're telling them?  That's right.  Where were the monkeys?  No, that was the other story, stupid.  Why is the river brown?  Yeah, it's kind of like.  All right.  Club store to Kenny doing Secret Agent Man.  You want to hear that?  I want to hear Kenny.  Yeah, I love Kenny.  And then maybe Mike Rowe will treat us to a little rendition of himself. 
[03:33:30]  Here's Club Soda Kenny.  No, not yet.  Secret Agent Man.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  It's great.  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  With every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow. 
[03:34:00]  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Hey!  Beware of pretty faces that you find.  A pretty face can hide an evil mind. 
[03:34:30]  I'll be careful what you say, or you'll give it all away.  Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.  Here he goes.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Ah, the musical instruments. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  That's good enough, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's a good taste.  You get a little taste.  That's on YouTube, by the way.  That's big, man.  What do you think?  That's big.  I don't know how to top that.  He's got a hell of a voice.  Yeah.  He really does.  He's good.  Not professionally trained.  Believe it or not, I was just going to say that.  It's kind of hard.  You'd think he's a guy.  He was also in that union.  Yes.  Agma?  Yes.  Agma. 
[03:35:30]  Yes.  Agma.  No, agony, because that's what you fucking feel when you listen to him.  That stood for, oh, God, my ass.  Agma.  Yeah, sounds like someone's great grandma, Agma.  That was horrid.  All right, sex allergy story.  What is this?  Need a little background on it, or do we just play it?  Big laughs.  Big laughs will ensue.  All right.  Wrap in, kids.  Some women have an allergy to, really.  Is it sex allergy? 
[03:36:00]  Is it latex they have a, so they can't use condoms, or is it loads?  Oh, oh.  Well.  Because there are women with latex allergies that have a problem with condoms.  Right.  It's loads.  Ew.  It's loads.  They did this on the news?  And, yeah.  And it can be treated by...  More loads?  More loads.  I swear to God.  Wow, how great is that?  This might be one of the greatest stories ever.  Here it is.  Well, Connie, in theory, you can be allergic to anything that's foreign to your body. 
[03:36:30]  But could you imagine breaking up in hives or having trouble breathing because of sex?  Well, because of sex can make some people giggle, this allergy is certainly no laughing matter.  One excuse to break up with a guy?  You're allergic to him.  Allergic to another person?  Uh, I suppose it's possible.  Yes, according to new research, sex can cause a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.  The problem? 
[03:37:00]  A semen allergy.  The local reactions are burning, itching, discomfort, after intercourse, usually a short period of time, a few minutes to up to an hour.  That's how you know your wife has been out cheating, though.  She says she's going to play cards with her friends and she comes back with hives all over the lower part of her back.  Scratching.  Or on half her mouth and on part of her cheek.  And you can actually see the load pattern.  It just fucking burned into her like a scarlet letter.  Old fucking Hester Prynne took a load in the face. 
[03:37:30]  That's how the townspeople knew.  Oh, my God.  Dirty wife.  The albino letter.  Jimmy's angry, Mike.  That's a great allergy, though.  Fucking...  Yeah.  It makes you just want to cum in her face even more.  I can't.  It makes...  I know.  I know.  In severe cases, the woman can have difficulty breathing.  It's not the sperm that women are allergic to, but the protein in the seminal fluid.  Other possible triggers, medications, and certain foods like nuts can be transmitted. 
[03:38:00]  No, she didn't.  No, she didn't.  Good grief.  Are you kidding me?  That's tremendous.  She did say that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not the sperm.  It's the nuts, Greg.  The trouble breathing I've seen in slap-happy videos.  That's true.  She won't be able to breathe as she's puking all over the hog and having her hair pulled. 
[03:38:30]  That does make natural breathing difficult.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the seminal fluid.  Other possible triggers, medications, and certain foods like nuts can be transmitted through the semen.  One way to diagnosis?  Well, it goes away with condom use or abstinence.  So who does it affect?  Approximately half the women with this condition already have skin out of their yoga.  They did notice a correlation, though, that as soon as the allergy clears up because they're not having sex, the black eyes increase. 
[03:39:00]  That's horrible.  We got a chick that has this allergy.  No.  Yeah, hold on a minute, though.  Condom use or abstinence.  So who does it affect?  Approximately half the women with this condition already have skin allergies and hay fever.  And more than 40% experience symptoms the first time they have sex.  But, ladies, this is not a sentence for celibacy.  It can be treated.  Allergy doctor David Resnick says all it takes is a small, diluted amount of semen introduced to the vaginal tract repeatedly for several hours, 
[03:39:30]  gradually increasing the concentration.  So does he volunteer to do this procedure?  That guy needs his license.  Just a little bit.  Over a few hours.  Look, I got the solution.  Mrs. Johnson, relax.  There's hope.  This might hurt him.  Do you think to start with, like, some crazy doctor going, ah, I know what the solution is,  and he actually tried and went, holy fuck, this actually works.  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Come on in and we'll work on you.  And he charges her afterwards.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  A few hours.  That'll be $500.  At the end, the patients actually receive a full dose of undiluted semen, and they're considered desensitized.  And then the trick is to, yes, have more sex, at least two or three times per week.  This is a prescription both the woman and the man will enjoy.  I wish I was being allergic to somebody.  Yeah.  Are you allergic to me?  Nope.  Only girls can be allergic to guys. 
[03:40:30]  Because this potentially can be a life-threatening allergy, patients with it have to carry around an EpiPen and definitely have it available during sex.  Who thought she was going to say they have to carry around semen just in case?  Yes, semen or the anti-venin.  Right.  Quick.  Yeah, your wife is having trouble.  She's going into shock in the restaurant.  You've got to lift her legs up and pump semen into her box real quick.  You called a major D over.  Hold the leg.  Get a busboy out here now. 
[03:41:00]  Stat.  Is there someone with a heart on in the house?  Anyone.  Is there a pervert in the house?  Great.  The good news here.  Doctors say a semen allergy is not a direct cause of infertility for women looking to get pregnant.  Obviously, they have obstacles.  But one option is in vitro fertilization.  Jim and Connie, I am so surprised.  I've never heard of such a thing.  We learn something new every day, don't we? 
[03:41:30]  Can't take a Benadryl for this.  Well, I guess we know, but you like it.  Fucking shot deep, don't we, sister?  Let's talk about the weather.  Let's talk about the weather, because we can get in real bad trouble if we even elaborate on this any further.  Let's move on.  You can't take Benadryl for that.  Yeah, but you can't take a meat drill.  Holy shit, is this on ice?  Did I say that?  It would have been funny if the woman came back and the first thing the female newscaster said,  Would gargling with it help?  Back to you.  I'm allergic to sex, too.  When I fuck, my cock sneezes. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, here's Todd with the weather.  Test pattern.  Haven't had to use it in 25 years.  The Indian test pattern.  What a great allergy.  Absolutely.  Never heard of that one.  Mike in Cleveland, what's up?  You guys are going to ruin the next episode of House.  You're giving it away now.  I'm an all-new House.  Yes.  Semen allergies. 
[03:42:30]  House must fuck 20 women to save one.  With his game laid.  Yeah, with his cane.  He's fucking with everything.  As they're standing over the dead body,  Sam, that wasn't white paint in the carpet.  Quincy, right?  Of course.  Yeah.  It's the only Quincy impression I've ever seen in my life.  It's the finger.  It's all in the hands.  And the teeth.  Teeth.  You get the Jack Klugman going.  Oh, genius.  Well, Nicole has this allergy. 
[03:43:00]  Nicole in Jersey.  Nicole.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, I was thinking that I had this allergy,  and then when you guys are actually talking about it,  and there's a story on it,  I realize that I guess I do.  I don't have it as bad as the hives or anything like that.  But my boyfriend and I used to have sex all the time,  every day when I was at school.  Not a problem.  And now that we're both not at school,  it's only a little bit here and there,  and I get the whole painful, the burning, 
[03:43:30]  the uncomfortable, everything like that.  Excuse me.  Oh, boy.  That's not an allergy.  I could be, yeah.  You might be allergic to gonorrhea.  You're allergic to herpes.  No.  No.  No.  Or chlamydia.  It's definitely a real thing.  Why don't you get tested?  I just got tested.  I have nothing.  Wink.  I've been tested.  I've been tested.  I don't have anything.  Are both leaving pots in your pubic hair?  I don't have any there either. 
[03:44:00]  Just a thought.  The deadliest cat.  That certainly is.  Yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  So what?  You really think you have this allergy?  I don't think I have it to the extreme sense,  but I think I do have a little bit.  A little bit,  because when she was having a lot of sex,  I guess it was desensitizing now every so often.  Exactly.  It feels like.  So your guy there is not using a bag?  No.  No bag?  No, he's not.  Are you on the pill,  or does he just like to fill you? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I'm on the pill.  All right, you're on the pill,  and then you get all itchy down there?  After.  After?  Does it get red?  No, not really.  It's just extremely uncomfortable.  What do you have to use?  And it goes away after like a half hour, 45 minutes.  Do you use one of those back scratchers?  No.  What if you get some on your hand or somewhere else?  No, it doesn't affect anything.  Doesn't affect anything but down there.  What about your bottom?  Do you wind up looking like one of those monkeys? 
[03:45:00]  She's rubbing her asshole on the carpet.  She's biting people's legs.  She's cranky.  Biting cameraman's legs.  You mentioned the burning.  I mean, what do you mean burning?  It's like uncomfortable burning, itching,  and it's like even uncomfortable just to sit down,  to walk, anything like that.  And I've always told him, like I would tease him,  like I'm alerted to you,  and here I guess I am. 
[03:45:30]  Maybe he's sporting.  How big is he?  He's pretty big.  But I've never had this problem with him before.  Size queen?  No.  Are you a size queen, sweetie?  Size queen.  What?  Do you crotch surf when you're in the mall?  Are you a size queen?  No.  No?  No.  Does he noodle you?  That could cause the world's deadliest snatch.  Mark Saylor from the Bronx.  I think we know Mike's next dirty job,  applying semen to women for allergy relief. 
[03:46:00]  Hey, there you go.  That's Matt from New York City.  Come on.  Save it for sweeps.  Save it for sweeps.  That's a sweeps show.  All right, I don't know what we can do for you.  Yeah, well, now you know.  I don't know, but I just wanted to call in.  I'm a girl who has it a little bit, I guess.  You need a better dosage, a bigger dosage of semen.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Yeah, I guess.  I need it more often.  Who knows?  But how do you fill a prescription for semen?  The doctor said semen.  Yeah.  And if it's a doctor, you think there's got... 
[03:46:30]  Someone in the medical community helped me out.  Undiluted semen.  I bet you there's something you have to...  At first, it's got to be diluted,  and then kind of work your way up to undiluted.  And I'm gathering you must have a mate  or somebody that can give us a little sample  and then add it in to dilute it, whatever.  I don't think the doctor just unzips his blind  but the patient's...  I have an idea.  You know what they do?  I mean, if you have a rare blood type,  you've got to store up your own blood,  and you have to keep it handy 
[03:47:00]  in the event of a little misadventure.  An accident or something.  Why don't you have your boyfriend,  while he's away at school or whatever,  make a daily deposit  in some sort of airtight,  hermetically sealed container,  FedEx it to you,  you keep it on hand,  begin daily applications,  even while he's away,  you can treat the problem,  so when he comes home,  it's Jimmy Cracks born,  and I don't care.  She gets all these weird packages,  FedEx from his college,  fucking,  one day it's sheets,  the next day it's the sweatshirt of a fat girl, 
[03:47:30]  all these weird places his teeth have wound up.  What do you mean,  a gym sock?  Oh, look.  Ask what Brown can do for you.  Just rub it on it.  It's all right,  whatever it takes, honey.  All right, let's go to Fontaine,  Fontaine,  Fontaine, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I want to play,  what did we learn today?  Yeah.  I learned that Louis C.K.  is not the only person  ever to pull shit from a cunt.  Yeah, we did learn that today, yes.  Language.  Yes, sir. 
[03:48:00]  Did he get you?  Yeah, he did.  He was saying that Louis,  yeah, that's the story Louis told.  Oh, Louis told a great story.  Louis' story of child rearing.  Nothing funnier, man.  Unfortunate turn of phrase,  child rearing.  Child rearing.  Well, it's literally,  he has to, you know,  you don't think of the horrible things  you got to do  when you have a child  and he has a young daughter  and he pretty much  has to clean crap  where you would think  out of her ass,  but he says, 
[03:48:30]  no, crap gets everywhere.  Sure.  In her little vag and everything  and he's got to wipe it out  and clean crap  out of his young daughter's vagina.  Hallmark just doesn't make  a card for that.  No.  No.  Yeah, they do.  Roses are red,  violets are blue.  Kill yourself.  Poor stride.  I am big pentameter.  Let's go to Sean  from Atlanta.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I knew a girl that  if she was giving her boyfriend 
[03:49:00]  a blowjob,  her face would turn red.  You know, if any of the...  Was he holding her nose  while she did it?  I think that's the angry dragon,  isn't it?  Yeah.  It's like nose.  It rocks.  I know a girl.  Her face looked like red.  A girl who would turn red  when given a blowjob,  but it was because  it was her uncle.  She's a little embarrassed.  This is awkward.  Yeah.  Jesus, this is a little...  Let's go to Steve 
[03:49:30]  in Missouri.  Steve.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  I got a quick question  for Mike,  and then I want to know  if I can guess that sound  you guys were doing  the other day.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike,  you ever start one of those jobs  and just quit  because you just couldn't do it?  We've cut some days short,  you know.  I mean,  let's see.  No,  we finished everything  we've started,  but we haven't aired  everything we've shot,  you know,  because some of them  just go sideways  and get so weird  that, you know,  I mean,  I went to a skull  cleaning facility 
[03:50:00]  in Oklahoma.  These guys basically,  it's called flensing,  and they get,  they literally will flense  the skull of anything  from a bear  to a dog  to a human.  And, you know,  when you prepare a skull  for universities  or hospitals  or whatever,  the process of getting  the flesh off of it  is just hideously complicated.  They also create  these fully articulated  skeletons  of people's pets,  which is so friggin' weird.  Whoa.  But your dog dies,  you know, 
[03:50:30]  and you don't want  to get it stuffed  because that would be crazy.  Right.  It's creepy, yeah.  So you just get  the skeleton made?  You have a skeleton  that you can pose.  Anyway,  we go to this place,  it's called Skulls Unlimited,  and we spent the day there,  and it was,  it was just,  I mean,  it was amazing.  Does it stink?  Oh, no, no.  It,  it stinks when you get  into town,  but when you actually  get to this place,  it's,  it's way beyond anything  you can assimilate,  so your body just kind of,  shuts down.  Yeah,  it just kind of shuts down.  I mean,  they've,  they've flensed, 
[03:51:00]  you know,  they have human heads.  I mean,  they've got licenses.  Yeah, that's where the skull's  got to come from,  inside the head,  so what do they just  have,  heads?  Most of them come  from China,  where the 81%  of all executions  take place.  Falun Gong.  Skulls.  They just take the heads  and flends them up.  So you get there,  and you're confronted  with this thing,  and you know there's no way  in hell it can err,  but now you're there,  and you might as well do it  and cross it off the list.  Something you did.  How do they take the flesh  and the hair off a head?  There's a boiling process,  but mainly it's knife work. 
[03:51:30]  You go in,  and you just peel it  like you would.  Potato peel?  Yeah.  Yeah, basically.  Did that scratch the skull  up if you need it for research?  Well, that's the thing.  You've got to get really,  really close,  but not so close,  so you have to leave  a membrane on it,  and then you have to start  a series of boils.  And when you come in  in the morning,  now they do the same thing  with a horse.  When I got there,  they had two horses  in a kettle  about the size,  maybe five feet across  and five feet deep,  and it was full of this,  it looked like soup,  you know?  There were two entire horses 
[03:52:00]  in there that had been cut up  and they were just boiling  all the flesh off the bones.  Oh my God.  Oh my God,  that's right.  You open that door  and it's,  the first thing that hits you,  as bad as it smells,  it's not the stench,  it's the heat.  And then behind the heat,  it's like that thick,  wafting funk,  and it gets in your hair  and your clothes  and you don't smell right  for, you know,  a few days.  It's bad.  Wow.  Really bad.  So we shot it,  we sent it to the network,  they were like,  no.  Yeah, what are you,  insane?  No.  But we cut around it  and we got something,  you know, 
[03:52:30]  that we were able to air.  I am amazed  that somebody has a job  of taking  what amounts to  a potato peeler  and peeling the flesh  off of human heads.  I just didn't think  that was a job.  Bad job.  Wow.  Bad job,  and it's happening  in Oklahoma.  It's 2006, right?  Yeah.  That's what year it is?  Okay.  Wait, 81% of all executions  in the world  are in China?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  We gotta work harder  as a country.  We really do.  They're a lovely culture.  We've got to come together.  Come on, 
[03:53:00]  bring that number up,  people.  We can do it.  But don't they  fucking kill you  for anything there?  Like littering?  Oh, yeah.  It's like a capital offense?  Tax evasion.  Hey, where did that guy go?  Anything against the government.  He wanted to guess that sound.  You punch up 99.9%  of the websites you go to  and you'd get your head cut off.  There'd be somebody  with going,  I think I saw this guy  at a comedy club.  Yeah.  Give me the potato peeler.  Yeah, boom.  Go on.  Jimmy's head.  Yeah.  The guy wanted to guess  the sound,  but he's gone.  Mike, you want to try  to figure out what this is?  I'd love to. 
[03:53:30]  All right, let's do this.  What the hell is this? 
[03:54:00]  It's an execution in China.  That was the Chinese court  deliberating.  No guess?  Well, I mean,  there was a whistle,  obviously,  and then it was those  two quick click-clicks  that we're trying  to figure out.  A click.  We're trying to figure out  what that whole thing is.  The hell?  That whole, yeah.  Guess the sound.  A lot of people  are guessing tasing.  Huh.  No.  Let's go to Peter  in Boston.  Peter.  Hey, guys.  Did you let that line  go through  that Mike had,  the what can Brown 
[03:54:30]  do for you  when you talk about  sending in all the stuff  from college?  It wasn't going on.  Thanks, man.  That was a great line.  That was good.  When it absolutely,  positively has to be there  in a week or so.  All right,  let's go to Mark  in MD there.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Come on.  I found your show  by listening to  Toby and Anthony  the last time you were on  and I just wanted to tell  you how much I enjoyed it.  The first episode I saw 
[03:55:00]  was the one where you  kept getting sprayed  in the mouth  with the termite poison.  Yeah, it was a bad day.  It was a bad day.  I never laughed  so hard in my entire life.  Those guys you were  working with  were freaking knuckleheads.  Yeah, that's Bill Bretherton.  He runs a company  called Vexcon  up in Shreveport  where there are more roaches  per square foot  than anywhere in the country.  Why there?  Why not in Shreveport?  It's a high water table.  It's a low-lying area  and we basically went that day  not to deal with roaches 
[03:55:30]  but to kill termites  in a church  that had literally  eaten the foundation  out of this thing.  So we're crawling around  out of this church.  Bill's not a carpenter  but his whole family  gets involved  and it just turned  into a Three Stooges episode.  We're trying to shore up  this church.  Termites are everywhere.  Could you see the termites?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, little white  tiny little  little pieces of pus  crawling around  and they are  they're everywhere  and anyway  he's got this  I think it's called Termidor  it's this very toxic stuff  and we're  trying to apply it 
[03:56:00]  and the applicator's  all screwed up  and I scored it.  Hits me in the face  hits my cameraman  in the face  you know  this after he's  basically spent  ten minutes  telling us  don't let this  come in contact  with any area  that's sensitive.  Yeah, good stuff.  Did you see roaches too?  Oh sure.  That's gross.  How many roaches  have you seen?  You ever see a lot?  I see one every once  in a while  in my apartment  no big deal.  Well, I just went  to New Orleans finally  you know  I didn't want to go  down there for a year  after this mess  because I just  you know  the country doesn't need 
[03:56:30]  another schmuck  standing in the rubble  you know  acting like a hero  you just figured  it was time  I'll save you  You just figured  it was time  to party  I'll save you  Well, you know  we got  Juana is here  Oh God, yeah  So, we're gutting  houses down in  St. Bernard Parish  you know  and some of these  houses  a lot of them  were underwater  for over a week  and they haven't  been touched  in over a year  so the entire  inside is completely  like there's a  layer on it  and inside the 
[03:57:00]  layer are  I don't know  millions of roaches  you know  you just start  they're everywhere  man  You realize how  outnumbered we are  Oh, it's not even  close  and every house  you know  it's a  I mean  there's not much  new to say  about that  situation down there  but it's  Does it freak you  out when you  see that many  roaches?  Well, sure  but I mean  again it's like  you know  if one freaks you  out  a hundred's  gonna really  Wow  and a thousand  you'd think  off the charts  so where do you  go with a million?  It's like  your brain  can only get 
[03:57:30]  its notion  around so much  and you know  Roaches creep me out  They're awful  That's just  remember that  on Creepshow  I literally  see Creepshow  Sure  What's the matter  Mr. Pratt  Bugs got your tongue  Bugs got your tongue  And they come out  of his chest  and his mouth  In the sewer  I had to kill  about four or five  of them  that had crawled  down my jumpsuit  and were right above  the crack in my  ass  and the small  in my back  and they were  everywhere  and I had to  smash myself  against the wall 
[03:58:00]  I swear  and the  sewage guys  are like  high-fiving  because they're  like  every day  that's the only  way to kill them  when they get  in your clothes  you just need  to mash yourself  against the  closest hard object  Why do they  get into your  clothes?  Why not just  shore it up  so they can't?  Because you're  drenched in sweat  and anything you  use in the way  of tape  forget it  And they're  roaches  don't go anywhere  Are they big ones  or no?  Sure  I've seen  roaches as big  as my thumb  as big as  China's  what you call it
