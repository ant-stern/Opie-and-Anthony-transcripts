<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recurring bit featuring Mike Tyson, in a wildly aggressive persona, launching into a series of highly offensive and misogynistic insults directed at the British royal family (including Princess Diana, Prince Charles, and Sarah Ferguson).  Jim Norton and Adam Ferrar were present in the studio, joining in the laughter as Tyson described a violent, fictional altercation with British police. This transitioned into a discussion of "Stalker Patty," a fervent fan who had caused a disturbance at a previous show. The hosts shared a rambling letter from her, apologizing for her behavior, and then took a call from Patty herself.  She revealed she'd urinated from stress during Opie's previous confrontation with her.  The hosts continued to mock her.  The conversation then shifted to the upcoming appearance of "Limo Anthony" at a live show, with the hosts and callers brainstorming increasingly humiliating and potentially harmful pranks, including paintball fights and dart throwing.  Limo Anthony eventually agreed to have darts thrown at his bare back in exchange for promotional plugs. Stephen Lynch is mentioned as being present during this segment.


The show continued with a studio visit from comedians Stephen Lynch and Mike DiNicola, who shared stories about his radio experiences in Green Bay, Wisconsin, highlighting the tense relationships between on-air personalities. Mitch, a 7-foot tall former Harlem Globetrotter hopeful from Survivor, and "Annoying Laugh Anthony" from Top Notch Limousine were also in the studio.  A significant portion of the show involved a dart-throwing game targeting "Annoying Laugh Anthony," with each successful dart earning the show promotional plugs, with bonus points for darts that stuck.  The game resulted in Annoying Laugh Anthony being hit multiple times, drawing blood, leading to further on-air commentary. Listener calls followed, including a humorous segment with a caller impersonating an elderly man needing a motorized scooter.  There was also an extended, sexually explicit bit about a buxom ex-cheerleader's diary entries detailing alleged encounters with Regis Philbin. The segment concluded with Anthony recounting a disappointing date he arranged via CB radio, reminiscing about the CB radio craze.


The next segment began with a discussion of Dan Rather's emotional 9/11 report, which the hosts mocked, comparing it to comforting a grieving grandfather.  This led to a comedic skit where they impersonated Tom Brokaw, using a VCR to play emotionally charged movie clips (from *Terms of Endearment*, *Armageddon*, and *The Bodyguard*) to induce fake tears and boost imaginary ratings.  A call from a man with Tourette's Syndrome followed, inquiring about a Nevada brothel's services, resulting in a somewhat awkward conversation about his preferences.  Comedian Richard Jeni called in, but the hosts repeatedly put him on hold, forcing him to call back from outside the studio. Jeni, initially frustrated, eventually entered the studio.  The ensuing interaction included teasing and insults, with Jeni expressing discomfort at times.  Other callers voiced their opinions, some criticizing the hosts' treatment of Jeni.  The hosts eventually tried to smooth things over, and Jeni eventually relaxed, participating in the conversation about his stand-up act. The show concluded with Opie recounting a story about being caught masturbating by his girlfriend, leading to a lengthy and explicit discussion about masturbation with various comedic metaphors and impressions, including a "Judas Priest jerk."  The hosts and guests laughed throughout this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Digitally enhanced to cover the Austin area with real talk and Texas sports, the Jukes 1370.  It's Opie and Anthony on the Jukes 1370.  I won't piss them off any more than they already are, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, hey, you limy bitches.  Any of you limy bitches want to come in here and see who could take a punch like Robin Givens?  Come here, you bitches.  I'm gonna kick your ass. 
[00:00:30]  Come here, Opie, you're the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come here.  Get out of my face.  I'll punch you.  Come here, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me?  Why are they angry?  Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look.  It's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Oh, couple of body clothes.  Oh, you can't even take a punch. 
[00:01:00]  You're like Spinks.  You're like Spinks.  I came out of the corner and pounded him.  Now I'm gonna bend the queen over her chair and do her in the caboose.  Just like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was I banged.  I went to prison for that.  I want a man in prison.  Prison.  Why do I sound like the man dog?  I'm gonna make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you. 
[00:01:30]  You're gonna be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm gonna bang you in your big ears.  Come here.  Okay, here's a fine lady.  Now I want to talk sense to you.  I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  And don't look at me like that bitch.  What would I do?  I don't even understand. 
[00:02:00]  I'm like an animal.  He's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing him around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want like a water grapher or nothing.  They want to kill me.  Thank God they're all too much pussies to have guns over here.  Even the police don't have them.  Look, here's one of them bobbies.  That big stupid hat.  Look, I'm kicking his ass.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around.  Remember that King Kong movie?  He was in New York and he couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, come on.  The cops don't have guns so I can run rampant.  Come here, you bastard.  Look, I'm beating up the police.  Are they throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls.  That's all they got.  Look, I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace.  And they got them guards with the big fuzzy hats on.  You can't make them change the expression on their face.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now look at this.  Look, now it's a bloody expression. 
[00:03:00]  I made it change.  Now I'm going to take that furry hat and stick it in your keister.  And that's only to make room for my giant member.  Well, look, it's Prince William.  Look at that fine young little man.  I'm going to beat himself and abuse him.  I love England.  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer them like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them out there at once. 
[00:03:30]  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you limey whores.  Y'all got bad teeth.  Your teeth, they suck.  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's a cure.  You look at it.  You look at it, bitch.  Go ahead.  You ain't never seen on Netflix.  Where's you, Grant?  I'm going to do him, too.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut bag. 
[00:04:00]  No, I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young.  We're all the guy ramping through the city.  Lady Di was a slut whore.  Going out with a towel head.  Making her country all pissed off at us.  Look at me just smacking down.  He's mad at me.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway? 
[00:04:30]  I'm waiting over the people of England.  Well, there's still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they're all stupid.  They got two TV stations that suck.  Yeah, look at my Mighty Metal, you bitch.  They only got two teeth.  And that whole head.  I went to that, uh, I went to the London Zoo.  Yeah.  The other day.  Uh-huh.  And they tried to stop me from leaving.  Yeah.  Something about an escapee. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up.  Sam Ferguson is a fat bitch.  I don't care if she's on that weight watches or nothing.  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here.  Come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Yeah, now it don't.  Now you lose some weight.  You're a fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red.  Now so's your nose.  And now so's your ass. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, look, here's a queen.  Come here, queen.  Right in the face.  No dried up slut.  You're making Mike Tyson laugh.  Stop it.  Try to stay in character.  Man it up when Rick screwed up my sound of weight.  Now I'm gonna go climb Big Ben and swat at aircraft. 
[00:06:00]  T'was beauty killed the beast.  It's Fay Wray.  Take me back to Skull Island.  Nasty ass English people.  Got the big gappy old teeth.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs. 
[00:06:30]  You people suck.  Am I winning them over?  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Luftwaffe did.  They won with the aircraft back in World War II.  Look at this.  I'm gonna bite off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big ass ears that...  He is an ugly mother... 
[00:07:00]  Here you go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants because...  His wife, the whore bag, Lady Di was going out with a towel head.  People of England, your Lady Di was a whore.  How am I doing?  You're not doing too well there.  You had a muff like Don King's hair. 
[00:07:30]  You're gonna have a heart attack.  I need any more flack from you limeys and Prince Charles is gonna take it in the leather Cheerio.  Come here, Sarah Ferguson.  Bang over.  I'm gonna punch you in the rectum.  That's a low blow. 
[00:08:00]  Let me know if I'm welcome back any time soon.  You guys sucked at the Falkland Islands. 
[00:08:30]  A bunch of little Mexicans kick your ass.  James Bond's a pussy.  I better get inside.  I'm just starting to throw stuff at Mike.  That's Mike.  Tom, what's up?  All right, listen.  That was hilarious, I gotta say. 
[00:09:00]  But about what you said about Prince of Stianna, that was pretty bad, don't you think?  Well, she's a whore bag.  The chick was a slut.  Why do you think she was in the backseat of that car?  She was giving road head to her towel-headed boyfriend.  That gappy-toothed bitch.  That's all, y'all.  Oh, did he hang up?  He didn't like my commentary.  I hung up on him.  I didn't want anyone wrecking our buzz today.  Oh, lady dying. 
[00:09:30]  In the backseat, I heard that that towel-head boyfriend or her's member was in her hand, ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson.  That's what she would look like if it was one of my bros.  That's right.  She's screaming from the grave, that dead bitch.  I heard it was caught in her teeth.  Teeth.  How do you spell teeth? 
[00:10:00]  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  T-E-F-F.  T-E-A-F-F.  Tooth.  How do you spell teeth?  That's all, y'all.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:10:30]  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:11:00]  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  In the studio, Jim Norton, Adam Farrar.  Let's check in with Dallas.  Craig, what's up?  What's up, man?  Yo, man.  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday.  What's up, man?  What happened?  Y'all was bagging on D-Town yesterday.  Talking about y'all will never come to Dallas.  Why not, man?  Well, we're on in the middle of the night in Dallas, so it's kind of tough to do anything 
[00:11:30]  for Dallas.  I know.  That's the only thing that sucks, man, because I work at another radio station here in Dallas,  and I work in the daytime.  And I caught you guys one night, man, and I got hooked.  And I'm up until 2 in the morning every night trying to catch you guys, man.  That is so weird that we're on 10-P to 2-A somewhere.  Yeah, because they would rather bring in.  See, what happened is, let me tell you, there's a station down here.  Does anyone else care in America, though, what you're about to say?  No, I'm just asking. 
[00:12:00]  Seriously.  I'm a big Cowboy fan, dude.  I'm a big Cowboy fan.  And we'll go to Dallas, I think, when the Cowboys win two games in a row.  Craig, thanks for the support, though.  We appreciate that.  Hey, man, I love you guys, man.  I'm still listening every night.  All right, all right.  Hey, till then, till y'all get a better shot, man, holler.  All right, peace!  Yeah.  All right, we have lots to do.  We have a letter from Stalker Patty apologizing for her actions on the show the other day. 
[00:12:30]  Apology.  Do you see how lunatic this woman is?  This is what mental patients do to pull you back in.  Yes.  They make you feel sorry for them, and then, you know, you realize you're a human being,  and then you're like, okay, I'm sorry, and then they're close to you again.  I was shaking.  And, well, we could read this.  It's about a five-page letter.  Oh, my God.  And in the letter, she talks about...  There's no punctuation.  No, in the letter, she talks about being an ant, which is pretty interesting.  Being an ant.  You know, she thinks she's an insect. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Well, it was a while back, I believe it was Norton, right, that said, this woman has the  body of an ant.  She is.  She's very frail and fragile looking, and her body is very ant-like.  And we've been goofing on her about that.  Now she's acknowledging it in her letter.  She's referring to herself as an ant.  Yeah, you want to get everyone up to speed about what happened the other day.  Not the whole Patty story, because that's a nightmare.  Patty's just basically a stalker of this program, of Opie and more so. 
[00:13:30]  Thank God.  No joking.  She really is a stalker.  People are like, ha, ha, a little radio bit.  I hear this stuff on the morning zoo all the time.  Ho, ho, hey.  What makes her a scary stalker is she can lift ten times her body weight.  Right.  Very scary.  Right.  A stalker doesn't have to be the person that shows up at your door with a gun.  It's preferable.  But it doesn't have to be.  And Patty is a type of stalker.  And we learned stalkers stick together.  So there's a stalker in Chicago who decided to mail Stalker Patty all my personal info. 
[00:14:00]  And I was taking care of it behind the scenes, but Patty decided to tell my girlfriend, and  she lost her ass at the Beacon Theater, which made for a nightmare of a night.  So then I lost it on Patty the other day.  Not only that, though, but Patty at the Beacon Theater was all pissed off and upset that  she couldn't get backstage.  Meanwhile, it wasn't our gig.  It was Jay Moore's.  She was complaining to certain people, like looking at people that were backstage and going,  I saw people I didn't know back there. 
[00:14:30]  I've been involved at the show for quite a while.  Why?  Why am I being treated like this?  Four fists waving in the air.  She's more concerned about people she doesn't know being backstage and wants to know why  they're backstage.  Tiny abdomen shaking back and forth, hanging from that little thread-like thing between  the thorax and the abdomen, that little hair-like, whiskery piece of material that is just too  thin to support life.  I never realized how it worked. 
[00:15:00]  But on Patty, it's just shaking back and forth.  Why?  Right.  So she was, I have something real quick.  She was standing just outside the entrance to the dressing room, and she looked at me  and said, they're not letting me go up there.  So I said, I don't know, Patty.  I was standing there with six people that I brought with me that were members of the union  that I worked with.  They're very important people.  This one guy resembled Keith the cop.  He resembles him.  Mind you, I mean, you look at him, you know it's not Keith the cop.  She stood there staring at him going, Keith, Keith, and the guy, and the guy didn't answer. 
[00:15:30]  The guy was like, who is this?  Why isn't Keith paying attention?  I'm one of the family.  She was frightening, man.  Hey, what's this white powder in the envelope?  Oh, don't even.  It's probably dandruff from her pubic hair.  Worse than anthracs.  She addresses the whole trying to get backstage at the Jay Moore show at the Beacon and other things. 
[00:16:00]  We left it with basically making Salker Patty cry.  We're not proud of ourselves, but that's what happened.  No, no, cry is too nice a word for what she was doing.  We told her to get lost.  She was, like, bawling, hysterical, like when you see in the movie they tell somebody that somebody they love just died.  That's how she's crying.  And, as per Mary, our intern, she released fluids on herself.  She was so upset. 
[00:16:30]  There's no 100% guarantee with that, but she smelled very, very funny.  She smelled like someone that was at the Friars Club.  Right, like a diaper.  Yeah, exactly.  No, because we asked you to, she was so upset and losing it that we said, Mary, please bring her to the bathroom so she could kind of freshen up and get herself together.  I didn't.  What did we do?  I didn't do anything.  She was upset and you guys were laughing.  Oh, so you, okay, all right, all right, that's fine.  Why are you making fun of me? 
[00:17:00]  All it was was the fluid we used to bond the larvae together in the chamber till they hatch.  It has a urine-like scent, so it's how we keep the walls up in our holes.  I don't understand.  She was shaking.  I mean, shaking to the point where she couldn't walk from the bathroom to the studio.  Like, she was holding on to me.  You know, they do that just before they attack.  Yeah, they shake.  They do shake. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And they come out of everywhere with those huge mandibles.  They jump.  And what is that we're not proud statement?  We're not very proud of that.  You were very happy with that.  I've never seen Opie so pleased.  I was just trying to redeem myself because of the email I got the next day.  Oh, yeah.  Usually email doesn't get to me.  Some of it was...  I should have read some of that in the air.  One of them was from Cindy Williams.  She was really great.  Yeah.  And because of the Patty incident, I shredded my vocal cords, by the way.  Yeah.  Because of this.  Shut up! 
[00:18:00]  Literally shredded them where I might have to go to, like, a throat specialist.  That's like Muslim rage.  My voice hurts so much every time I talk now.  Yeah, that is Muslim rage.  This is like...  Picture the flags burning.  They're chanting.  All the beards.  There's filthy animals in the streets.  And then they're yelling...  Shut up!  Yeah.  I can see it.  That's not...  There's not a lot of distortion in that, by the way.  That's...  That's...  That was my voice.  Going past what your vocal cords are supposed to do. 
[00:18:30]  One more time.  Let's hear it.  Shut up!  Okay.  Yeah.  So Mary, when she walked Patty to the bathroom, she came running back in saying,  Hey, man.  Patty relieved herself.  She smells like, you know, a number one.  Right.  Like she did a number one on herself while weeping.  That's not what Mary said exactly.  Mary came back with her hand out and said, smell my fingers.  And who didn't?  Usually that's hot.  Everyone did. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Until you realize.  Smell my fingers.  Okay.  Okay.  It was Patty.  I don't know what to do.  All right.  Well...  She hit on Patty.  I will hand over the letter to Anthony so he can read it as Stalker Patty.  This is the...  Okay.  Latest installment of the soap opera that is Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Let me see the...  Just listen for the guilt.  Here it is.  And this is what mental patients do.  They give you the guilt and then you invite them back into the fold.  Oh, wait.  We need some music before you read the letter. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, play that sad walking away song from The Incredible Home.  Oh, and I and company.  This is in response to Monday's episode in the studio.  Please cut me a little slack.  You're judging me kind of harshly.  My life has been turned upside down in the span of less than a week.  And I had to move an entire room into storage, pack my bags, leave a place that was an illegal 
[00:20:00]  rental that I didn't know about under an immediate eviction, finding myself suddenly homeless overnight  and scrambling for temporary lodging, trying to relocate to a new home.  What does that have to do with anything?  With no money and conti...  There has not been a period yet.  And continuing to work my two jobs without taking any time off. 
[00:20:30]  You're right, no punctuation either.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I've gone to North through Solid Rock to see the light of day.  And she goes, on top of that, the two crooks I rented from for three months with no lease 
[00:21:00]  were threatening me over the phone at work because they wanted more money from me.  One was a blue oddball.  So, so they're...  They're trying to get more money from her?  She'll pay it.  Distortion is part of this letter now.  Right.  Last night I found a place, actually signed a lease,  and made arrangements to tag on an extra to the rent 
[00:21:30]  to make up for a security deposit.  The first page I just flipped over,  nothing about anything but her problems finding a place to live.  Well, that's what they do, though, man.  And now some of the stress I've been carrying  is beginning to go away as problems get solved.  All this was happening in the span of a couple of days  with no mental preparation of warning 
[00:22:00]  and not knowing what was going to happen next.  Plus, I was alone with my situation,  fending for myself with literal or no help from others in the colony.  With no help from others.  In an unforeseen situation that just heaped itself on me.  Some of that bottled-up stress expressed itself on Sunday night. 
[00:22:30]  I know I should not have gotten so upset  when I wasn't allowed upstairs after the show.  I'd been dealing with a huge situation all week  and merely wanted some company in a festive atmosphere  that would take me away from my circumstances for a couple of minutes.  Shut up!  Because I was not a stranger to some people upstairs, 
[00:23:00]  I didn't think it was a problem to come up and mingle a little.  Maybe I needed some people to be with me at the moment  and felt frustrated that I could not have a couple of minutes  to escape my situation.  There's the guilt.  There's the guilt.  She just wanted to come back  and have a little companionship.  As for our issues concerning the correspondence from Chicago, 
[00:23:30]  it was an error in judgment on my part.  I'd been concerned about it since I handed it in.  It was an additional worry  on top of what I suddenly found myself going through  a couple of times before.  And maybe someone from the show  could have reassured me  that I was okay  and being here  that I would not have felt the need  to mention it to the wrong person 
[00:24:00]  by mistake on my part.  Sometimes silence  and no feedback  can increase my anxiety.  and Mike gave me an impression  that it's worse than it was.  I merely wanted to know the status of the letter 
[00:24:30]  and what happened with it.  I didn't realize it was not good to tell Sandy.  She was the first one I saw  and I asked about it on impulse.  As a lot of  baggages on my mind,  that was one concern  I needed to be relieved from.  I had never gotten a letter like this before. 
[00:25:00]  Can laughter, always funny.  Sorry, go ahead, Anne.  And with no prior experience,  I didn't know what to think of this.  I felt I needed to ask anyone.  Please be fair to me.  I've done nothing wrong  that I can see  in a technical way. 
[00:25:30]  I've just been reacting  to stressful situations  that have been forced on me.  Walk it off, Dink.  That was stuff I didn't ask for,  or plan for.  I admit my behavior  wasn't the best.  Be more funny! 
[00:26:00]  As for our correspondence  from Chicago,  direct anger toward him or her.  They may have done something illegal.  Harassment.  Be it a letter or a phone hang-up,  it's against the law.  She knows that.  Who is this person?  And why did they do this  to begin with?  I'm losing my spiritual team. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, baby!  I'm not Super Lady,  a Wonder Woman.  Super Lady!  Has there been a Super Lady?  No.  Excuse me.  Has there been a Super Lady?  No.  With a body like an ant, 
[00:27:00]  Super Lady!  I'm buffing away.  I'm not Super Lady,  a Wonder Woman.  I'm anorexic, bitch!  Even with six legs  and the physical...  Now, this is real.  This is what she's writing.  Even with six legs  and the physical strength  to lift 50 times  my own weight  or with my  compound voice,  which I probably...  beats Opie's 2015 vision. 
[00:27:30]  I'm still a human ant  who is more sensitive  than most.  I do have feelings  when I go through  circumstances  that are bigger  than an average person  goes through.  please forgive me  my temporary  loss of sanity  and welcome me back  to your good graces  and company of the show.  Thank you.  It's the retarded combo. 
[00:28:00]  I got ya.  Sweet,  merciful crap!  That's right, Homer.  I gotta be honest,  Patty made sense.  Yeah.  The letter was actually  fairly coherent  and made sense. 
[00:28:30]  In what type of way?  Just that, you know,  she was well-written.  She rambles  on and on.  All right,  do you feel the guilt  in that letter, though?  Yeah, it's like,  here's all of my problems.  I don't need you  compounding my problems  by pointing out  my ineptness  and mistakes.  Nice girl,  but about as sharp  as a sack of wet mice.  I've had several  close friends  that when they start  laying stuff like that  on you,  you get rid of them. 
[00:29:00]  Bolt!  Yeah, but I keep  coming back,  you freaks.  Run!  Run!  Yeah.  Oh, that's the  guilt machine.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, Patty.  Oh, well.  The meditations  don't work!  There's the latest  on the Patty saga.  They can't believe  it's the letter.  Where's the rock  that was tied to?  Is that what?  Thrown through the window.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  You guys want to get rid  of Stoker Patty?  Tell her that she's...  Tell Dice that she  stole a bit  or drop a raid bomb.  Now, it's mine.  All right, very good.  Thanks, man.  Then I'd have to  get in touch  with Dice  through certain  correspondence.  That poor, poor,  pathetic mess  that she is.  Bill, what's up? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen, man.  You guys are cruel  and insensitive.  I mean,  you guys are bordering  on inhuman.  But, man,  you're funny.  Thank you, Bill.  I mean,  screw you.  I want to find out  if she wet herself, though.  I know.  Don't you need  to know that now?  Yes.  Faster than a speeding  bullet that's headed  towards Opie.  I'm sure she's up there.  More powerful  than a locomotive  that I wish  would hit Opie.  Able to leap  tall buildings  and hopefully  on the other side  land on Opie. 
[00:30:30]  It's Super Lady.  Super Lady.  Super Lady.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  It's pretty impressive  that Anthony knows  all the friggin'  anatomical terminology  to the ant.  He's the smartest  air conditioning repairman  I've ever seen.  I ran into a few  up in the ductwork.  Jack is.  Ants are pretty impressive.  When you step on their house  and kick them out,  they seem to find  a second house.  Every time.  See, Patty is just like an ant,  not only in body,  but it seems  time after time 
[00:31:00]  her little ant hole  gets kicked over  by some kid  or you'd pour some juice  in it or something.  And the next day,  what do you see?  Not a ran help.  They're right back there again.  moving on  just like Patty will.  And she don't think  of the psychological problems  the ant faces  when you kick  that nice straight line  there,  cracking a cricket apart  on one end  and the hole's at the other.  And her instinct  is to swarm.  Just swarm.  That's it.  The ant herself  is calling in.  How did she get  the hotline,  by the way?  Patty.  Hello. 
[00:31:30]  Well,  you sound very upbeat now.  Well,  yeah,  I got a place  to live now.  That's good.  Did another  swim take you in?  What?  Yes.  Well,  anyway,  I just used  the phone number  on the left.  Patty.  Patty,  you're upstairs,  right?  Yeah.  Of course you are.  Yeah,  Ronald and I  were both listening.  Ronald.  Yeah,  she just went back  to work  after we were listening.  So why are you  in the building today?  She heard there was 
[00:32:00]  Popsicle sticks here.  Why?  Because I wanted  to run up  and show Ronald,  you know,  what I was hearing.  At the news department  up at 1010 Winds,  I actually,  I heard that  Lois Lane  was falling  with a helicopter  from the roof  and Super Lady's  got to catch her  as she falls  to the street below.  Well,  anyway,  Opie yelled  at me so hard  on Monday,  yes.  I didn't even know  it, 
[00:32:30]  but I did.  What?  My.  I'm out of here.  I did.  Opie yelled at you.  I'm sorry,  he's so intimidating.  That is the best thing.  That's how I get  when I'm intimidated  enough.  Is that what it was?  If you're loud enough  and threatening enough,  yes,  I will be  intimidated enough.  No.  That's the thing.  Is that what you did? 
[00:33:00]  He intimidated you  and yelled at you  and you wound up  going all over yourself?  Well,  yeah,  I did.  I threatened  health.  I didn't even know  it until I left  and came up back.  Well,  everyone else knew.  Everyone else knew.  You must be taking  vitamins or something.  When the ant  feels threatened,  it secretes a must.  You get kind of scary.  You really do.  Shut up.  Wait a minute.  I'm getting warmer  in my crotch.  By the way,  Tom,  yes, 
[00:33:30]  Norton is on the floor  rolling around.  Norton,  you want to get off the floor?  That is like a scope,  man.  She tried to spray you  in self-defense.  That's one of my  superpowers  that  super lady has.  I'm not super lady.  Actually,  I am super lady.  And what I do,  one of my defenses  when one of those  super villains  come as I wet myself  and the smell  chases them away.  Just because  you're super lady,  you don't have to behave  like Christopher Reeve  since the accident.  Super lady. 
[00:34:00]  Flying away  on her maxi pad.  Very funny.  You're a mess.  How bad  do you leave yourself?  Not that bad,  but I did.  It was enough.  It was enough.  Patty,  since you didn't have  a place to live,  where'd you shower?  I stayed at  friends' places  over the last  five days.  I stayed on  leave.  Super friends?  Yeah,  I had a couple  friends on Staten Island.  They let me stay  overnight.  I made my home  in the North Pole. 
[00:34:30]  It's a big  frozen yellow castle.  Guess how I make it?  I don't know how.  Super lady flies  high above  the North Pole,  and I listen  Opie yell at me  and as I wet myself,  it lands on the  icy mist below  gigantic yellow  ice castle.  Then the smell  keeps the villains out.  Well, anyway,  I think I did a  very good job  for myself  getting a place  within three days 
[00:35:00]  and set to move  in Thursday.  And if Opie  really scares me,  I'm going to put  a brown roof  on the whole thing.  Super lady.  Super lady.  Where the hell  did you get that?  Super lady.  The emaciated mess  flying through the air.  Girls leaking  themselves,  always funny.  Cleverly disguised  as a 45-year-old virgin.  That'll be a good  lesson I learned.  Girls leaking  themselves, 
[00:35:30]  always funny.  You know,  I think I owe  Mary, the intern,  an apology.  I thought she was  exaggerating.  No way.  Just don't yell at her.  Say yes and good  and I didn't know  it until late.  Shut up.  She just wet  herself again.  Opie's like her  nemesis.  It's like kryptonite.  Opie's yell  just makes her  relieve her function.  It's like kryptonite.  Wow.  Oh, no.  A good hit  with kryptonite. 
[00:36:00]  I wish I had  that power.  You were right.  Yes, you were right.  I didn't know  for sure or not,  so I was right.  No, you were right.  Oh, my goodness.  I thought you were  exaggerating.  Lex Opie.  It's a bird  like Buddy.  It's a plain  looking woman.  No, it's  Super Lady.  Power's beyond that  immortal woman.  I can let myself.  Don't worry,  I'll swoop down 
[00:36:30]  on the villains  and level them  with my yellow fluid.  Flying on the wings  of a maxi.  Flying on my big wings  of a maxi pad.  I fly over the villain  and f*** yourself on them.  Can you breathe  my mind?  My hymen  is like lead.  I don't know  what kind of  Superman tie in that is,  but no one's  sure it,  no one's  seeing through it. 
[00:37:00]  It's Super Lady.  Able to open  stuffed jar lids  with her labia.  Super Lady.  You're going to love it.  She is never  a disappointment.  Super Lady stinks.  Dude, we've got to  get her a suit.  Literally.  It's around Christmas time.  We've got to get her  a suit for the Philly show.  A cape and a diaper.  Super Lady.  A cape and a diaper.  And then Ovi  could yell at her  on stage  and she could  wet herself.  Price of admission.  I thought we were  reenacting the carry scene 
[00:37:30]  with the soccer paddy.  Oh, are we going to  put her in a gown  and some pig blood  on her head?  No, this is better.  After talking it up  like she's going to be  the queen of the prom?  They're all off of you.  Look at your  dirty pillows  that's showing.  I don't have  any dirty pillows.  We've got to get  a Supergirl outfit  for her.  My hairy pillows  that's showing.  My hairy pillows.  That's what they are.  It looks like  the stuffing's  coming out.  I better  write some  care of speed  because she  can't get you. 
[00:38:00]  Nice.  We have to  take a break.  The Opie  and Anthony  Show.  This one's for the  kids.  The kids out there.  Yeah, because  you guys know  that I do a lot  of elementary  schools.  I do.  I like to come in  and sing some  cute little songs  to the kids.  You and Barney.  One thing I feel  is that I really  need to stress  to the kids  that they can be  anything they want  when they grow up.  And I tell them,  oh, I'm serious.  They can be doctors  and lawyers.  And I say it's 
[00:38:30]  fun to use  your imagination.  So I tell the kids  that they can be  a superhero  if they want.  Oh, very nice.  Any kind of  superhero they want.  Isn't that cute?  They can even make  up their very own  superheroes.  Okay.  So I play this.  This is for all  the kids.  Seriously, if there's  kids listening,  it's just for them.  It's really not  for adults.  If I could be  a superhero,  I would be  an awesome man.  I'd fly around  the world  fighting crime.  according to 
[00:39:00]  my awesome plan.  And if I saw  criminals trying  to lie,  hurting other  people and  making them cry,  I'd haul them  off to jail  in my awesome  van.  Because I would  be awesome  man.  Yeah.  When I say  kids, now you  know.  We all know  that when people  offer you drugs  and alcohol,  like me,  you just say  no, right?  If I could be  a superhero, 
[00:39:30]  I would be  drug-free boy.  Telling the world  of the evils  of drugs  and all of the  lives they destroy.  Well, I'd take  all the junkies  getting so high  with their needles  and bongs  and their sticks  made of tie.  As I burn them  alive, I would  squeal with joy.  because I would  be drug-free  boy. 
[00:40:00]  If I could be  a superhero,  I'd be  immigration dude.  I'd send all the  foreigners back  to their homes  for eating  up all of  our food  and taking  our welfare  and best jobs  to boot  like landscaping,  dishwashing,  picking our fruit.  I'd pass a lot  of laws  to get rid  of their brood  because I'd  be immigration 
[00:40:30]  dude.  Can I have  the kids imagine  what superhero  they would be?  They could be  any superhero.  If you could  be a superhero,  would you be  justice guy?  Making sure  people get  what they deserve,  especially women  who lie.  Like if a wife  left her husband  with three kids  and no job  to run off  the floor,  why was  some doctor  named Bob?  You could skin  them and drain 
[00:41:00]  them of blood  so they'd die,  especially Bob.  Then you would  be justice guy.  Or you could  be more subtle,  I didn't mean  to be vague,  give her the  mad cow disease,  let him die  of the plague,  as long as  they suffered  for their  horrible lie,  especially Bob.  Then you would  be justice guy.  Yes, then  you would be  a superhero 
[00:41:30]  like me.  Stephen Lynch!  There you go.  That one's for the  kids.  I like that.  That's cute.  You could just  picture them all  running around  like they're flying.  Listening to the song  with their cute  little blankets  costumes on.  Yeah, a little  cape.  A little cape.  Sure.  Maybe iron on  some letters  under their  little peaches.  Yeah.  It seems like 
[00:42:00]  every hole in  my body  is exploding  every liquid  imaginable.  Okay, everyone.  The radio station  Austin's been  waiting for is here.  The Juice 1370.  That could work.  Oh, my God.  The disgusting  retarded  Charlie's Angels  and Bosley.  I'm in.  Angels,  I have a mission  for you. 
[00:42:30]  Disgust Opie and  Anthony at all  costs, all the  time, forever,  forever, ever.  Anthony.  Hey, guys,  what's happening?  That Anthony  from Vinyl,  he don't need  you guys no more.  He's a big shot.  He's going on  other shows on  WNEW,  plugging his show.  What other show  you go on?  The sports guys  called me  in the morning  because that's  okay.  They called me,  brother.  They called me.  I didn't call them.  Now you don't need  them anymore.  That's not true.  You're a big tough  guy.  You get loud  with them. 
[00:43:00]  That's all right.  Opie's letting you.  He's giving you  enough room  to hang yourself.  What's your name?  It doesn't matter  if you want my name.  You can come see  me at the roadshow  tomorrow night, too.  Oh, my God.  Come see me.  Do you want to  beat people up  because we'll make  that happen on the stage?  We'll have a punching booth.  People can just come in  and punch you.  You don't have a bad ankle.  I'll try my best.  No, you want people  just to come on stage  and beat you up?  No.  Basically, because you know  what?  I won't come there  by myself.  I'll come there  with like 40 people  I know  and we'll all pummel  you together.  There you go.  We need like,  can we like,  I don't know,  we need to do  something with him. 
[00:43:30]  I tell you,  hang out over here.  Can we shoot paintballs  at you on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, you can shoot  paintballs at you.  I need a paintball company.  Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  But am I protected  at all?  You guys, wait.  You get goggles  and a cup.  That's it.  You're so cocky.  We're going to shoot  the paintballs at you.  Shoot paintballs at me.  Shoot paintballs at me.  And he has no flow.  He doesn't.  You have no idea.  How far away?  No, I don't.  Actually, I've never been shot.  It doesn't matter.  We could shoot you  200 yards.  You'd still hurt.  Still going to hurt? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  It'll hurt a lot.  You, um...  Well, you know,  you're the one that...  It's up to you guys.  You don't like me  in here anymore.  If I get a free pass  from now on  and come in here  whenever I want...  We didn't invite you.  You'll be very injured.  My last gun  did 125 feet per second.  It hurts.  It hurts, man.  Did you see Jackass?  No.  Did you see  what his legs looked like?  No.  It raised welts  the size of half dollars  and they were black.  Forget about it.  I don't feel like  getting maimed.  If you're going to go  far enough,  I'll...  You've got to know  what you're getting into. 
[00:44:30]  You're a pussy.  Only in the butt.  Only in the butt.  In the ass?  Yeah.  You act all brave on the radio.  Pussy.  I'll take it.  We'll do it.  How many shots?  How many shots?  20.  Absolutely not.  You're an ass.  How about a game  of asses up  at the road show?  He goes how many shots?  You know what?  One shot would do it.  So then you know what?  You'd cry like a little girl.  You know what?  I bet you I won't.  John, what's up?  Yeah, this guy...  The other day  I was looking  to the sports guy.  I thought to him every day  and he's on there  and they had some guy  who was coming in 
[00:45:00]  who was going to be  all drunk and hammered  because he hadn't drunk  for God knows how long.  But he was there  and he said,  I'll do you guys a favor.  I'll drive this guy home.  I'll give him my limo  and he was plugging  his company out the ass.  I'm allowed.  They called me.  You got a problem with that?  No, they didn't call you.  You were there.  How do you know  they didn't call me?  6.30 in the morning  they woke me up  out of sleep.  All right, scum?  Oh, whatever, man.  You're a C-dump Chuck.  All right, scum.  All of a sudden  he turned into T.J. Hooker.  I know.  Look how brave you are.  Okay, scum. 
[00:45:30]  No, but he doesn't know the facts.  They woke me up  at 6.30 in the morning.  I don't care  if you're on that show.  Don't have fun with them.  You're a busted scum.  They put on a good show.  I don't care.  You know what?  So what are you trying to say?  You don't want me here  to go with them?  You don't want to add  anything to our show.  Maybe they'll have better luck.  Dan from Hoboken,  of course,  Rick wants to do asses up.  Goddamn, Dan.  Let me get Psycho Mark  on the air.  Psycho Mark.  Have you talked  to your doctor  about Stacker 2? 
[00:46:00]  Hey, there it is.  What's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Dude, I got my paintball gun.  I'm going to freeze  some paintballs  and I'll have that thing  shooting around  300 feet per second.  You ain't doing it.  That'll leave wealth  on his back  like grapefruit.  I got my paintball gun.  Yeah, I can't, Jack.  He's backing out now.  Five shots.  I'll give you five shots.  Anthony, you are such a wimp.  Why don't you stand  like a man  and take 20 shots  right in the sack?  You know what?  Okay.  We only need... 
[00:46:30]  I'll take shots.  He said he'll take five shots.  Five shots will do the trick.  Yeah, but from how far away?  I know you'll be point blank  and put it on my skin  and shoot me.  Ben?  Not only that,  Mark has like the top  of the line paintball gun.  Yeah.  This thing is like...  You have never been...  Five shots, I'll do it.  Have you ever been hit  by a gun?  No, I have not.  I'll do it.  You're so stupid.  See, this guy,  Dan from Jersey,  is a genius.  He actually has a solution.  Why not kill  two birds with one stone?  Put the hair paint  in the paintball guns  and shoot Limo Anthony  in the head.  So it'll stick. 
[00:47:00]  All right, guys.  We'll see you later.  All right.  People coming up  with ideas for you.  And we want to do  one of these ideas  tomorrow night.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, Doug.  Perfect thing  for Limo Anthony.  Yeah.  Human dartboard.  No.  Oh, come on.  But you can round off  the edge of the darts  a little bit.  Can't throw some darts  at you?  All right.  Those big lawn darts.  How's that?  Hold on.  We'll make it...  What's a kill?  Doug, you're onto something.  I'm going to hang up on you  because we need to do  some wheeling and dealing.  Okay.  Matt.  I wasn't even coming  tomorrow night.  Listen. 
[00:47:30]  I wasn't.  Listen.  Go ahead.  You need plugs  for your stupid business,  right?  Yeah.  That is floundering.  It's not floundering.  It's doing very well.  The only reason you're  starting to call  the sports guys.  Let's be honest.  Okay.  You're wrong.  If you become  a human dartboard,  we could negotiate here.  Okay.  Plugs for darts.  Plugs for darts.  Right, Ann?  What are we going to do,  though?  Actually throw darts  into them?  Yeah.  We'll protect your spine.  Oh, thanks.  I've seen this done before. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  But it's done by those guys  that put the blockheads,  that put the nails  in their nose,  and put vice grips  on their nipples  and whatnot.  You really want to hurt me?  No, I want to see you,  you know...  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want  to make me cry?  I just want to see you  jump around in pain  for a little bit.  I'll do the paintballs.  I'll do the paintballs.  I don't think  they're going to allow that,  though, obviously.  Yeah.  Darts, though,  very easy.  We could do it here.  Now. 
[00:48:30]  How about you take one  from a potato gun?  That could kill them.  A potato gun.  I think it's just going  to be nice to me.  It just goes over the edge.  I'll take the darts.  You'll take the dart?  I'll take one dart.  How could you take a dart?  I'll put it...  Do I get to protect myself  in all my vital areas?  Man, you want to be loved.  Vital area.  You want to be loved so bad.  I actually didn't mean to...  Shut up, man.  He wants to be loved so bad.  I'm surprised  he didn't come in here  with a bandage  and an eye patch. 
[00:49:00]  You'll take darts?  I'm not allowed in here.  My girlfriend...  Never mind.  Your girlfriend  won't allow you in here?  Why?  She thinks you're over the edge.  Oh.  Hey, we got some darts right now.  Well, when she becomes of age,  she'll understand  what the show's all about.  She's 24.  Here, I got darts right now.  We don't have to wait  for the road show.  All right.  Let me see one of those.  Oh, my God.  For each dart  that hits your back  will plug your web...  Absolutely not.  Why?  One plug?  That's nothing. 
[00:49:30]  No.  There's four darts.  Ant gets two,  I get two.  Give me one of those.  Let me see how the tips are.  They're not even that sharp, Ant.  Look.  Feel.  Oh, that's nothing.  These things are worn down.  And you said you had a hairy back.  He got enough protection.  You barely get a quarter inch in you.  Here's the deal.  Go ahead.  Here's the deal.  For each dart we throw,  we plug your company.  Okay?  If we get one to stick...  If we get one to stick,  which is possible,  and a stick is like  it sticks and then falls out,  five plugs.  Five plugs for your company. 
[00:50:00]  Get out of here.  Look at what you're aiming at.  What do you think?  What?  Let's do it.  We'll do it?  Yeah, let me go get...  All right, someone's got to...  Honestly, someone's got...  Whoa!  I aimed for the wood.  I hit the wood.  Don't throw the door back.  Did you see?  Look at the mark on the wood.  I know you did.  I aimed for that, my friend.  All right, here's the deal.  Because this guy needs plugs bad.  I don't need plugs.  Fine.  Listen.  Listen.  No, Rick, you've got to listen.  We need to figure out  how to protect his spine.  That is really crucial.  Spine.  Gee, thanks.  Just the spine.  These aren't even going to go in. 
[00:50:30]  They're too blunt.  You got any hammerheads?  Mine?  Yeah.  Of course.  Mine's going in.  Yours is going in.  And something to protect his spine.  We'll take a break,  and you're going to take  darts to the back, right?  Next?  I'll take darts to the back.  All right.  What?  If it hits a rib,  he could get quite an infection  in the bone.  Who cares?  It's him.  Oh, I know.  That is not nice.  Why?  Why?  What have I done to you?  Trust me.  I will take great pleasure in this.  Wow.  God damn it.  Is he tall. 
[00:51:00]  I could hit his pinky from here.  Mitch from Survivor is here.  He's got to be 7'4".  Oh, my God.  He's...  He's...  Wow.  Is he going to throw one at me, too?  We forgot to tell everyone.  Mitch from Survivor.  Yes.  Australian Outback is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  He just showed up.  Ah.  And we're throwing darts at you next.  Finally, we've got a show.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, you probably shouldn't go for his back.  It might hurt something.  But the place you could go for is throw him right at his ass.  Why not his back?  Well, you've got to...  I'm a little worried about the back, too.  Yeah, you've got to... 
[00:51:30]  What if we kill him?  That's a good joke.  Just see if we paralyze him  and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair going,  Hey, no, I don't take it personally, guys.  You know, it's cool.  I still like you.  You need anything?  Um, all right, Keith.  Let's see if he's up for that.  He's up.  All right.  Listen.  On a respirator.  We're going to have to throw him at your ass  like a game of ass is up.  I'm not happy about it,  and I'm sure you're not,  but it's safe for that way.  Shoot for cork.  Who's going to shoot for cork?  You're going to have to pull your pants down.  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You've got to...  No. 
[00:52:00]  Like, we're going to enjoy that.  Hold on.  I'm having a hard time  just listening to Opie  ask Limo Anthony  to pull his pants down.  It's got...  No!  The darts will go right through the pants.  They'll go right through my skin.  You're going to be covered up.  Get a grip.  It's either this cloth  or none at all.  No.  The back...  If we're doing the back,  then you've got to take your shirt off.  I know I'm not happy with this,  but we're not throwing it through a suit.  No, no, not a jacket.  What's wrong with the shirt? 
[00:52:30]  No, take the shirt off.  I've got a T-shirt.  It's got to be the back.  Just bare back?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  No.  No plugs.  You don't get plugs anyway.  You'll never get another plug.  Never get a plug.  Ever.  It's armor.  Because now you're backing out.  Everyone was counting on, you know,  hearing you get darts to the back.  And now you're, like, you know,  fooling around with the rules of the game.  And help me out here.  Come on, Ed.  What, bareback?  Yeah, it has to be bareback.  What's the difference between bareback and a shirt?  You have the record for the most wine bottles. 
[00:53:00]  You think it'll hurt more?  I don't think it's going to effing matter.  Tell you the truth,  once it goes through the shirt,  which it will,  it's the same thing.  It's not like it's armor.  You're going to hurt me.  You just got to throw it harder.  Make sure it goes through.  Because Steve's trying to get video for the website.  It'll just be a...  I don't want that on the website.  Whatever.  No plugs ever.  Ever?  Ever.  We'll even change the codes.  We usually change the codes  when we, like, fire someone.  We'll just change them.  So this is it.  Either I walk out  and never be with you guys again 
[00:53:30]  or have to get darts thrown on my bareback.  Yeah.  Darts on the bareback.  T-shirt.  This guy's saying that he threw darts at his friend  and punctured his kidney.  You got two.  That rocks.  This is just...  It rocks.  It does rock.  This is just reminiscent of Eddie Haskell and Lumpy.  I swear to God.  Come on, B.  Lumpy is Eddie Haskell.  What kind of...  And poor Anthony is Lumpy.  What kind of...  To use the term from yesterday, Anthony,  what kind of underpants do you have? 
[00:54:00]  Boxers?  No.  I'm not.  It was a star-up, James.  See, I don't want to see that either.  I don't want you to see it.  If you had the boxers,  it was doable, right?  Garrett?  All right.  Stinky?  Oh, my God.  Trying to call you by your real name.  It's a little weird, I know.  All right, Anthony.  I'm just saying,  whatever he wants to do,  shirt or no shirt,  I mean...  Shirt's got to be off.  Because we've got to make sure  we're not hitting your spine  or anything crazy.  Oh, for that reason?  Well, that's good then.  Okay, yeah.  So that way we can...  No, because I want to see him topless.  No, I just thought 
[00:54:30]  because you wanted it to hurt more,  but I'm just thinking  it'll hurt the same.  Once it goes through the shirt,  it's over.  And it'll just be funny  to see his stupid hairy back.  And you don't want to ruin your shirt.  Exactly.  There's so many laughs  involved with this.  No, I mean...  It's just a hairy back.  I've been doing you  for two and a half years  to get me back.  I'm going to enjoy this.  I know you will.  And we're going to do it next.  So get ready.  Do we have the spine protector?  So now we're going just back?  Oh, he's taking the shirt off.  No, don't take the shirt off  until we're ready.  What kind of spine protector is that? 
[00:55:00]  Dude, you're giving us  a lot of credit.  That thing's like  just as thick as his spine.  Any deviation either way  and he's still apt.  You know what?  Five plugs is not enough.  I want unlimited plugs  whenever I can.  Like Louis Black.  No.  Come on, I've done a lot.  It's not like you got arrested.  We're just going to throw  a dart at you.  You know, come close.  Louis Black was in a jail cell  for 28 hours  or whatever it was.  You know that.  But you did it.  Almost.  All right.  See, you've got to understand 
[00:55:30]  you don't do this  no plugs ever.  You do this,  you get lots of plugs today.  And then you'll be known  as the dart guy.  What about plugs in the future?  Possibly.  Always have my mic on  at all times?  Annoying laugh, dart guy.  No, we cannot agree  to having your mic on  at all times.  Mic on at all times.  Oh, yeah.  Always shut it off.  No, you're playing  with the rules.  We're on.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  It's Opie and Anthony  on the Juice 1370.  This show is turning out 
[00:56:00]  to be better than yesterday.  Remember what that guy 
[00:56:30]  said earlier?  He said we should go home  because we're not  going to be at yesterday's show?  We took on the challenge  and it's shaping up  to be a good one today.  Is that your dart throwing music?  Yeah.  Good.  I love the crows.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Wait, I want to say  something to you.  I want to say something to you.  We'll get to you  in a second.  See what I'm saying, Mitch?  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that.  Constant attention is needed.  How long would he have lasted  on the island? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  Hard to say.  A day.  Maybe a day.  No.  If he was the one  that fell in the fire,  they'd have left him in there.  Thanks, Ant.  Ouch.  Or hated them.  Without a doubt.  Turn into Lord of the Flies.  You could have heated  the whole camp  with that blubber.  Sorry, sushi boy.  Whatever.  Imagine him running  after the pig  instead of Mike  to feed everyone  on the island. 
[00:57:30]  Would have gone hungry.  Got you.  Oh, man.  All right.  As you can hear,  Anthony is sharpening  Wait a minute.  Sharpening the dart.  Anthony's been sharpening  the darts for,  I don't know,  since we started commercials.  Let me spiel, Ant.  Let me spiel.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a dart.  All right, here.  Give him to Stank  so he could sterilize him.  These things  have been blunted  for a while.  Wait, I'll get to you  in a second. 
[00:58:00]  I'm going around the room.  You're last.  Stephen Lynch is in  Blade, son.  Stephen Lynch is in  the studio, Anthony.  Need a limo?  Say.  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  Hey.  I could capitalize  on this.  Yeah, if you put a tarp  in the back seat  so the blood spurting  from your orifices  doesn't fit all over me.  So here's,  we got some tape  of the limo  pulling up  to pick up Stephen. 
[00:58:30]  Wow, that doesn't  sound like a limo,  but what the hell?  Maybe it is.  Also, Mike DiNicola  in the studio.  We haven't seen him  in a while.  Very nice to meet you.  Where have you been, man?  I was on the road.  On the road?  I was doing all  the horrible radio spots.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was in Green Bay,  Wisconsin.  Green Bay?  Yeah.  Murphy.  Murphy in the morning.  Is that where they just go,  you know,  they say,  hey, Mike DiNicola's  in the studio  and then they want you  to be funny  for ten straight minutes  and then they have  to cut you off  because they have  a weather break? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It was the really angry guy  who's been there  for 40 years  and he's got the two  sidekicks that hate him.  Let's go to the weather.  It's going to be cold.  Yeah, exactly.  So what do you think  about the pack?  Oh, they look good.  They look good.  Yeah, they sure do.  They sure do.  I've been a cheesehead  for years.  But you're being too genial.  They're really angry  at each other.  You walk in the studio  and it feels like  you're in trouble.  Like, why does everybody  hate each other?  Oh, really?  Like mommy and daddy  have been fighting?  They've been stuck  in Green Bay 
[00:59:30]  for 40 years.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the two sidekicks  were young  and they were cool  but the Murphy guy  was just this evil,  hateful guy.  That's always the way.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he was like,  so why don't you  just be funny?  Do you think  you can handle that?  I'm like,  I don't need this  at 6.30 in the morning.  So what'd you say?  Yeah, how much do you make?  What does your wife  look like?  Yeah, I bet.  That's always a good one.  That's a good comment.  That shuts right up,  my C. Nicola.  We learned that today.  Also in studio, 
[01:00:00]  Mitch from Survivor.  Hey.  The 7-foot white guy.  Right, right, right.  Great way to describe.  Well,  an ex-Harlem Globetrotter hopeful.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we learned  that about him so far.  That's a good way  to intro him.  Yeah.  Also,  annoying laugh,  Anthony from  Top Notch Limousine.  Need a town call, Mitch?  I may, I may.  I'll have to get your card.  Oh, once you got the card, 
[01:00:30]  you're done.  It's a tracking device.  He actually put  an electronic tracking device  in his cards  when he gives them out.  I know where you are.  If you take him up  on his offer,  just, like,  make sure he picks you up  about a block or two  from your house.  Okay.  That's so wrong.  Anthony on the phone,  what's up?  Hey, limo Anthony,  you douche dyke,  I got a question for you.  Thank you, sir.  You ever update your website  that still says  Opie and Anthony FM Talks.  I know, I know.  It's okay.  FM Talks?  He's been there for two years.  I've been working with him  for two and a half years.  I don't have time.  That means I'm busy. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  What did you make your website  on?  MyFirstAOLWebpage.com?  Microsoft.  Hey, that's good.  Give him the eye,  hell.  Bleacher creatures, baby.  All right, cool.

Are we ready?  Where's the darts?  Where's Stinky?  Stinky.  Who's got the poison tip darts?  Wow.  That's a good question.  This is sick, man.  He's begging me  to turn his mic on.  Isn't this wrong?  What was it?  He's begging me  to turn his mic on.  No, I didn't.  I said get off the site.  That's what I said.  Your mic's on.  That's what I was begging.  No, it's not.  Get off the site.  Let me tell you,  you can't even get 
[01:04:30]  to Top Notch Limousine  right now.  TopNotchLimo.com.  It's getting pounded.  It's getting pounded.  Hey, Stink.  Grab his mic for a minute.  What do we do to sterilize?  You threw a pen at me, Anthony.  Good job.  I got two effing darts  I'm going to hurl at your back.  The Bic lighter  and then rubbed him down  with alcohol.  Sterile.  Thank you, Doctor.  Sterile.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Yes.  I imagine everyone  understands what's going on here. 
[01:05:00]  Annoying Laugh Anthony  will be removing  that sweat-stained shirt of his.  He'll be facing a wall  and we're throwing darts  at his back.  You are just a cruel human being.  I know, and I love it.  You are just the worst.  You just gave me  a great compliment.  Thank you.  I know that.  You know it, too,  and you love  to see other people.  All right.  So Randy's telling me  to double in, double out,  but I think I'm just  going to shoot for a cork.  Shoot for a cork.  Well, hit me  with your best shot.  All right.  Listen.  So here's the deal.  For every dart  that hits you in the... 
[01:05:30]  How many darts  are we allowed  to throw at you?  Four.  Just four?  That's it?  Yes.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  For every dart  that hits your back,  you get a plug.  No.  And with every...  No.  And anything that sticks,  I get ten plugs.  No, five.  You can't change  the rules now.  I heard five.  You're talking  here now, right?  I heard five.  Go home.  What are you doing?  Go home.  I heard.  I turned the  stinky cam around.  Where's Anthony  going to stand?  He's going to stand  over there.  I want our listeners  to be able to see this.  Stand against the wall.  Where are you 
[01:06:00]  going to be standing,  Anthony?  Are we micing him?  Turn your...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think it's time  to get up.  All right.  Well, let him stand  there, and then,  Rick, adjust the camera  quickly so I can  take a look  and make sure  it's okay.  I'm good.  I used to be  on a league, man.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Of course, I was  after like 12 beers  before the first  game started.  I don't know  how I play sober.  All right.  Take your shirt off.  No.  Stand just like this.  No, we've got to  make sure we don't  hit the spine.  That's the only reason.  Look at this. 
[01:06:30]  Make sure you  mic him because  the noise,  that's going to  come out of him.  These are really  sharp now.  I love it.  All right.  Are we ready?  Who's going to  wait, wait, wait.  Me and you  got to get odds  or evens  for who takes  the first shot?  One, two,  five, five,  five, five.  You bastard.  All right.  Hank goes first.  You're going to  throw from there?  Yeah.  This is like  a pretty legit  distance.  All right.  Get out of here.  Turn around.  Wait. 
[01:07:00]  We should give  the visual.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's give  the visual here.  The tool  is against the  wall.  The tool?  Don't call me  a tool.  You know,  I would avoid  turning around  like that all the time.  Yeah, I know.  He keeps  winging his head around.  Hey, make sure you  don't.  Hey, did I mention  my eye?  Okay, his spine  is covered.  But is it really  covered?  Well, I don't know.  I'm seeing like  a little out  of that left side.  I could probably  take out his foot. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, there is.  I think I see  the nerve  that goes to his foot.  Anthony,  vertebraes  seven and twelve  are exposed.  Okay, Anthony gets...  Stop moving.  Turn around,  mask it back.  Okay, I'm going  to get a double  lumbar for out.  Now, don't bend down.  That's good.  Maybe we can  arc it in.  Anthony, move  closer.  No, this is how  far a regulation  dartboard is.  All right, go ahead.  And... 
[01:08:00]  Remember, if it  doesn't hit your back,  you don't get the plug.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Is he bleeding?  Oh, there's a hole  in his t-shirt.  Come on, man.  Come on.  All right.  That was a great  shot, man.  Oh, yeah.  I put that right  in the shoulder blade.  All right, wait.  Right in the  effing shoulder blade.  All right, three to go.  This should be good.  Opie's pitching.  Opie!  Wait, he gets  a plug for that. 
[01:08:30]  I forgot where  I work the pain.  Vital transportation,  1-800-GO-VITAL.  God, you are a puss.  All right.  You're taking the mic.  All right, Opie.  Opie's pitching  from the Little League  mound, so this one's  going to hurt a lot more.  Yeah, Opie's  really close.  Oh, God.  No, because I know  what he's just saying.  He's going to...  Oh, don't turn around  like that, Anthony.  You've got to put an eye out.  Don't stop it.  I'm very injured.  Don't move your head.  Oh, your Rick's  pretty close, too.  Opie!  Wait, I want to go for...  No!  Don't, don't... 
[01:09:00]  All right.  That's a tough shot, oh.  It's a little low.  Ow!  You suck.  Oh, he nailed him  in the love handle.  Man, he nailed him  right in the love handle, man.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is the most fun you can ever have.  You see that guard bounce off that line?  I got a plug, right?  Yeah, you got a plug.  It didn't even stick in. 
[01:09:30]  No.  Top-notch levoncenes.  It's 516-756-1663.  Oh, look at you.  Radio voice.  Shut up.  Make it stick.  Make it stick.  Come on.  Ten dollars if it sticks.  No!  No!  Firehawk!  Come on, Ant.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It's caught!  It's caught!  It's caught!  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're fine. 
[01:10:00]  Ask the room officially to that one stick.  No.  No.  It's caught, but it didn't stick.  We have blood.  We've got blood.  You got one more.  I want this bitch.  You got one more.  That's tough.  You got blood.  Hey, wait, wait.  You get five plugs.  Oh, good.  What do you want to do?  You want to do them all in a bunch?  You want to spread them out?  He's bleeding.  I'm bleeding.  I got to be eating this shirt tonight.  Come on.  Oh.  Yeah, there's a little.  Oh, my God.  He's bleeding.  He's bleeding.  All right, you can take a break. 
[01:10:30]  You need to take a breather?  Oh, my God.  Put a little tissue on him.  Did you see it hang there for a couple of seconds before it fell off?  Briefly, it caught.  All right.  He's worried about his T-shirt.  He has a little blood, and he needs to get him in the same spot.  He takes his shirt tonight.  It's already wrecked there.  What should I do, Sensei?  All right.  Leave my fat rolls alone tonight.  We're showing you.  How's the anticipation, not knowing when it's actually coming? 
[01:11:00]  It's the worst in the world, I'm telling you right now.  I'm not terrible.  Opie.  No, come on, Opie.  That's some really skillful shots here.  Opie, you could get...  So much!  Not look.  Come on.  Just wait.  Come on, no.  Shut up.  Rick, shut up.  You'd make a great terrorist, Rick.  Shut up.  You're going to talk.  Shut up.  You don't know when it's coming.  Three, two, one.  Go!  Like when you go to throw the stick for the dog, and he goes to chase it, even though you 
[01:11:30]  didn't throw it?  I didn't throw it yet.  I have a...  What?  Go.  Can I get a request?  Yeah.  Can I come to a regular character for this show?  What a tool.  What a tool.  Definitely on three this time, all right?  Count it down.  Count it down.  Three, two, one.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  No!  No!  Oh!  You winged that! 
[01:12:00]  Oh, wait!  Did he get the same shot?  He drew blood.  I didn't draw blood, and it didn't stick.  I didn't wing it.  That's pretty close to the same spot.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Come back!  Come back!  Come back!  Hold on!  You can slide all those mics over now.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Where'd he go?  Hold on.  Get him back in here.  What did he get all mad at?  Get back in here.  All right, he's coming back in here.  You drew blood.  I drew blood, and he threw it really hard, and it was two of us. 
[01:12:30]  You threw it at the same time.  I didn't throw five of them at you.  Anthony, I swear to you, I did not throw another dart.  I threw two darts.  Who threw the other dart?  I don't know.  Someone else in the room.  Mitch.  It wasn't me.  Mitch.  He's blaming Mitch from survival.  I didn't throw one, though.  I wanted to throw one.  I didn't get to.  Let me see.  Pull the shirt down so we can see the...  No.  It's a hole.  No, I'm serious.  Let me see.  It's a hole.  Let's see the actual wound.  Yeah, we've got to see the actual wound.  I don't want to take my back.  Well, just pull the shirt up or something. 
[01:13:00]  Let the prisoner go, Rick.  He is sweating.  There's beads of sweat.  You're free!  You're free!  You try sitting there while he's throwing darts.  Two years with the hatred on me.  All right, so how many plugs...  I get ten plugs, and I'll pick and choose what I want to use.  Wait, there was not ten.  Ten?  There's no way.  Five for Anthony's stick in one.  How many plugs have you done already?  Two.  Two.  So five plus the one I did, six.  And we'll give you an extra one for that other person that threw it at your butt.  So seven plugs. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  There you go.  Well done.  After one, I'm very impressed.  We will play those plugs on the Sunday night show.  Let's see the back.  Wait, we've got to see the back.  Hold on.  Yeah, let's see a good shot of that back.  No, turn around.  I want to...  Turn around.  I've got to see it.  I've got to see it.  Not that.  How did it get the...  Let me see.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was a nice one.  And then Rick rips more hair out of his back with some duct tape.  Insult to injury. 
[01:14:00]  The one I threw up?  Yeah.  Did you see the way it hung?  Yeah.  For a little bit and kind of went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then it fell out?  Did you see the mark?  Yeah.  It was a good one.  Look at how happy you are.  Did you see the mark?  It left a good one.  You've got two of them.  I will think about this for the next two months.  When I'm feeling down, I'm just going to start laughing like a little school.  Isn't that great?  Something to just perk you up.  Yep.  Start a lead.  Bravo, Anthony.  Bravo. 
[01:14:30]  So, Mitch, a survivor.  Who's...  No.  We've got Mitch from Survivor.  We've got Stephen Lynch.  Adelphi University.  Go Panthers.  Basketball.  There's one of my plugs.  Six left.  You're using that as one of your...  Yeah, it's my...  Oh, my God.  My alma mater.  Prista.  Hi.  I just have to say something.  Yeah.  When I first started listening to the ONA show, I said, oh, you know, maybe they're a  little too sexist.  But now I have to say, all men and women on the Opie and Anthony show are created equal. 
[01:15:00]  No, no, I think I've got to change that.  I think the guys are treated worse than the girls lately.  Without a doubt.  Anthony, now, it's a good thing you didn't ruin that shirt.  Well, it might.  Where'd you get that?  This I got at, um...  I don't know.  Where?  Joseph of Boone.  Oh.  Five left.  TJ, what's up?  This should be the only way people get plugs out now.  You've got to get well with darts.  I agree.  I was going to say, I agree.  All right, guys.  You've got to see the blood on his T-shirt. 
[01:15:30]  It sounded pretty painful out here.  You might want to, yeah, plug up the hole or something.  Yeah, put something over that.  My love handle?  Hey, Uncle John wants to know something.  Uncle John.  Yeah, I saw that.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, Limo Anthony.  I just got a question.  Hi, Uncle John.  How are you?  Shut up.  I'm pretty good.  Thanks.  One quick question for you.  I'll tell you all for you a dozen plugs.  Will you take a lethal injection?  I'll do it.  All right, Limo.  See you guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, what's up? 
[01:16:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know in Full Metal Jacket, when they start whipping private piles with the bars of soap?  Yeah.  Limo Anthony, you know that these guys are not your friends, right?  I'm realizing that more and more by the day.  That's funny.  They'll call me when I need something, but when I walk in here, they hate my guts.  You're going to be tonight laying in bed, and you're going to start to cry.  Without a doubt.  I'm crying already.  You make me sad, bro.  I make myself sad sometimes. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, God.  That's good.  Thank you.  All right.  Ant's been good, though.  You want anything?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right, Ant.  Thanks for taking.  Now you'll finally talk to me after two years.  No, I just wanted to know, because you're very entertaining.  I wanted to know if you need anything to cover up your cut width that you got on your  back, or anything to eat.  I'm all right.  Something to drink.  I'm okay.  What are you getting at?  What are you getting at?  I'm just trying to be nice to him.  Okay.  That's all.  You want a beer?  Yeah, I do want a beer.  What beer have we got?  What do you want, Ant?  I want a bun.  No, no.  More left. 
[01:17:00]  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  Fun is close enough, man.  People all know what a bun means.  The more plugs left.  The best part was just listening to you roping it.  Knowing exactly what was going to happen.  Dude, it's a deal with the devil.  Greg, what's up?  You never get the wishes that are entitled.  Right.  That you're entitled to.  We're co-Satans.  Greg.  Hey, Greg?  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, man.  What's the matter with that guy?  I don't know, man. 
[01:17:30]  That guy is dumber than a bag of hammers.  Oh, Anthony, man.  You've got to get your head examined.  Anthony's dart did stick to the back of Young Laugh Anthony.  I laid that in.  You know what that shot was?  When I'm trying to double out and I'm shooting the bottom of the board, I need a six, and  I was shooting for the three, so you try to lob it in.  That was it.  And it was a perfect, like, it had enough arc to it that it stuck in at a little bit of  an angle and then ripped some flesh out as it tips back down.  Thank you.  I was very happy with that shot. 
[01:18:00]  I was smiling when you were doing it.  I certainly was.  But not as smart as Hopey was.  You really enjoyed it.  I love that stuff.  Especially with me.  God, I love that.  All right.  Good job.  Yeah.  Bravo.  All the plugs to other times, right?  Anytime you're on, you can plug.  Right.  You got four plugs left, and you use them wisely.  You didn't read the contract.  It's a time limit, you know.  Thanks.  All right, listen.  We got to take a break. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  So, lots to go.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Real talk and Texas sports.  The Juice 1370.  You've got the Juice 1370.  See, I think she even, she just took up fighting, too, less than a year ago.  Yeah.  Name's Layla.  She's 21.  Very proud of her dad.  Of course.  Who has been working with her and supporting her.  Ali, former great, the greatest, as they called him, kind of, kind of a little different 
[01:19:00]  since Parkinson's disease has taken over after so many punches to the head.  I am the greatest.  I'd just like to know how he's training her.  You think he's in there sparring with her?  Oh, Ant, do you think?  Ant.  Come on, Layla.  Yeah.  I'll put him up.  I'll rope it.  Oh.  Boy, you slipped that one through.  I bet you can't get enough. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, that kind of left a molecule.  Decon foregone.  Kills roaches.  Oh, my goodness, man.  Baby, you got to stop.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You got to stop hitting your popper.  Now I'll perform the rope-a-dope.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby.  Boy, if I had any sense left, you'd just beat it out of me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, the body blows is hurting me, but oh, one to the face. 
[01:20:00]  Maybe my reflexes ain't quite as sharp as they used to be since I did the decon foregone,  and they locked me in the room with some of the bug sprays, baby.  Oh, that one was in the nutsack.  Oh, you knocked your popper.  That's wrong.  Well, not as quick as he used to be, yeah.  Give me the bell. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, what round?  What round is it?  Okay, I'll come out fighting.  Oh, baby, you got to stop hitting your popper in the face like, oh, God, there.  Oh, baby.  Oh, the body blows is killing your daddy.  I float like a cinder block and sting like foam rubber, and oh, that was my jaw, baby.  I'm the thriller in Vanilla.  All right, cut it out.  Oh, you got it. 
[01:21:00]  I loved Ali growing up.  This is wrong, Andy.  Where's Smolder and Joe Frazier?  Boy, I feel a little woozy.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Between the peach and the blue knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what? 
[01:21:30]  Okay, terrific.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie and Anthony on the juice 1370.  Later, they caught me.  I couldn't stand it.  Fantastic.  You know, when you're there with joy for so many years and a voluptuous cheerleader comes  up, you've got to bang her, Gelman.  Who wants to bang a cheerleader?  I do.  Yeah, I know.  Well, if you read, she's got a hot little body on her, too.  You see the picture on the post? 
[01:22:00]  My God.  Her son herself with those huge, firm boobs.  Well, she put on a little bit of weight from her younger days, but it seems to have all  gone to the right spots.  She's definitely doable still, though, Anthony.  She's got, like, the big boobs.  And there's Regis, a picture of him next time.  Ha, ha, ha.  Look, I'm laughing.  They didn't have intercourse, is what she's saying.  Which, I'm remembering now when the whole Monica Lewinsky thing went down.  Yeah.  Went down.  With Clinton.  And they were talking about it on live with Regis and Kathy Lee. 
[01:22:30]  And Regis always looked a little squirmy as they were talking about it.  And everybody thought it was because, you know, Regis doesn't want to get really deep  into that kind of thing, and it embarrasses him.  But the truth of the matter is, he was in the same boat.  There's the married guy getting oral and giving oral.  It looks like they were doing a little 69.  And saying that it isn't sex.  That's a visual.  And it wasn't cheating.  To have in my brain. 
[01:23:00]  I love it.  I got buried my head in there.  I can't believe you.  Gilman, you got to move your head all around.  Get your face involved.  Come on.  My tongue is numb.  I know how to eat it.  Just grab a hold of that there.  Now shake it like a pom-pom, you bitch.  Shake it.  I guess he was, what, a cheerleading coach?  It just says the buxom ex-cheerleader.  Maria Majeric. 
[01:23:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Back in 1991.  B.  Aggressive.  B.  E.  Aggressive.  Let's read some of her diary, shall we?  I guess she didn't do well on her SATs either.  Mm.  October 27th, 1991.  I met him in his dressing room.  He was nice enough to take a picture with me.  There you go.  The first little encounter.  Mm-hmm.  And then a few days later, November 1st, wow.  Oh, she says wow.  Ripping us off, won't we?  You wouldn't believe this. 
[01:24:00]  Regis called.  He's so fun to talk to.  Such a dommer.  I guess Notre Dame fan.  That was only a couple of days later.  So I guess she slipped him her phone number for him to call.  And they talked.  And then April of 92, a few months later, after a Notre Dame basketball team played in  a New York tourney, he kissed me that day.  Ooh.  I was startled by it. 
[01:24:30]  I was both flattered and intimidated.  I was exhilarated by the fact of who he was.  I'm Regis.  Look at me.  I grab you and I'm going to shove my tongue down your throat.  You whore.  Come on.  Suck it.  And then two months later, in June, after a trip to New York to talk with a publisher  about a book on cheerleading.  A book on cheerleading. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  We went back to his office.  And before I knew it, he had his arms around me and kissed me.  It was great.  Yeah.  Suck it.  I love it.  Well, she came in with those huge cans.  You see, Joy?  She's a stick figure.  I need something with thighs to press against my ears, Gelman.  Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah, stick it in my face, you whore.  About four months later, after an October 8th football game in South Bend, 
[01:25:30]  as soon as I walked in the door, he was all over me.  I'm a madman.  Look at me.  I couldn't hold myself back.  It's amazing.  Defense.  Now, she had none.  How could you defend against the Regis member?  You just want it.  I pulled out my junk.  She went at it like my t*** contained oxygen and she was drowning. 
[01:26:00]  That old cat.  That old cat.  That's in the diary?  Uh, no.  No.  It says, uh, yeah, he was all over me.  We did every intimate thing two lovers can do except intercourse.  It might seem strange, but we were both married and we felt we weren't really committing adultery  if we didn't have actual intercourse.  Oh, hello.  Well, come here.  Come in.  Come into my room.  I'll just get...  Oh, there you go. 
[01:26:30]  Let me unleash this.  Oh, yeah.  Little prison lube.  I learned that from Gelman.  Now...  Suck it, you whore!  It's okay, Joy.  It's okay.  It's not intercourse.  For $32,000, what is sex without being intercourse and not cheating?  Oral!  Suck it!  You need a lifeline? 
[01:27:00]  Here's one.  It's in my pants.  And then after their last tryst in the fall of 93...  Wow, so that went from 91 to 93.  A couple of years, Regis got hold of me and told me, I'm in room such and such.  So I guess she went to his room.  We were very passionate, as always, and stayed together for hours.  He really made me feel like a woman.  All right.  Now, put two and two together there. 
[01:27:30]  He made her really feel like a woman.  Mm-hmm.  I do believe he's good at the oral.  Without intercourse.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, you gotta dig in!  You can't be afraid, Gelman.  You gotta get in there.  Use it all!  Oh, I love it!  Love it!  You missed the best quote.  Where's that?  Regis had me strip naked and put my fur coat back on.  Where's that?  He loved that coat.  We made love. 
[01:28:00]  It was pure, raw, raging sex.  Wait, that sounds like intercourse.  Lots of kisses everywhere and very passionate.  We didn't have intercourse.  Everything but.  I'm like the gif.  I wanted to give her anal, but I couldn't.  Because that would be wrong.  That would be cheating!  So I just dug in.  I dug in like she was a bowl of Captain Crunch.  Oh!  You think he did boogaloo-galoo when he was digging for the pearl? 
[01:28:30]  I was digging.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  That's right, Gelman.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  Mmm.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Let me get in the canyon here.  Hello!  Yodel-o-da-lay-hee-hoo!  Look at me!  I dive in headfirst!  I got my whole head in here, Gelman!  It's huge!  It's like a cathedral!  Boogaloo-loo!  I'm over here now!  Get me a snorkel!  I'll be down here for hours! 
[01:29:00]  All right, bitch.  Now your turn.  Suck it!  Suck it!  All right.  Time to go.  Look what I did to you again.  You cheerleader whore!  So it seems...  Who would think?  Could you picture that?  The girl's looking down and seeing Regis's head.  How you doing?  Hello!  How's it feel?  Well, tell me!  Put on the coat. 
[01:29:30]  You'll put on that coat, you whore.  Put it on!  Yeah, so that's why he looked kind of squirmy, I guess,  when they would talk about that whole thing.  I wonder if Kathy Lee knew,  and they talked about it.  Well, there's a couple other things in the story.  Uh, she also has in the diary Regis telling her  how much she hated Kathy Lee  and how she talked about the kids.  Oh, really?  Hmm.  Well, that's a gift.  So that's in there.  Well, yeah, I guess it is a gift.  Okay, now get around back.  Uh, this is called the Rusty Trombone. 
[01:30:00]  I love it!  I'm gonna, I'm gonna...  Let me dig in here,  and I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you a thumb!  Is that cheating?  Do you think both Regis and Frank gave anal to the same chick?  Kevin wants to know.  Well, he took the back door, I took the front,  and we played cards on the back.  Wonderful.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello?  Hello, sir.  I'm an elderly gentleman,  and I need a motor, a motorized scooter. 
[01:30:30]  They call my name's Bill.  What's your name, sir?  They call my name's Bill.  Bill?  Yes.  Have you seen any particular type that you like?  I like the little rascal.  The rascal?  I saw that on, on the, uh, TV.  I'm a little rascal in my little rascal.  Uh-huh.  Is what the woman said.  That's what the woman said, huh?  And it, it, it, she has, uh, she's getting around,  she's shopping and eating ice cream.  How fast does it go, sir?  Uh, the fastest is about five miles an hour. 
[01:31:00]  I flew a P-51 Mustang in the big one.  Yeah, it won't go that fast.  Oh, it won't?  No.  I need, uh, also a, uh, room in the back for an oxygen tank,  because I'm on oxygen.  Oh, I see.  And it's got to have good suspension,  because I don't want my colostomy bag dislodging.  No, you don't want that either.  No.  Yeah.  The bigger machines will have, like, a spring suspension in the front.  Oh, boy.  My friend Petey's got one, and it's a real chick magnet.  Yeah? 
[01:31:30]  He goes around, uh, at the bingo game, and he gives the girls rides on the back.  Can I get a two-seater?  No, you can't get a two-seater.  But I can't be jostled around too much.  I got a prostate like a porcupine.  Yeah, I see.  Yeah, that's kind of tough.  You can stop by our showroom.  We have, uh, three or four models on the floor, and, uh, we get them in.  Excuse me, sir.  How the hell am I supposed to get there?  Oh, you don't, you're not driving anymore?  No.  I drove in a lake, and they took my car away.  Oh, I see.  Can I take one of these, like, on major highways? 
[01:32:00]  No, you cannot.  Because my grandson lives far away, and I like to play some ball with him.  No, you can't do that, no.  I can't?  No, the furthest sail goes about 24, 25 miles.  Is that the furthest range?  Yeah, and they go about five miles an hour, so you'd be kind of lost on the highway, don't  you think?  I don't have much, I have nothing else to do.  What else am I going to do with my time if it takes me two hours to get ten miles?  I don't care.  Yeah.  Also, I lost my arm in the big one.  Oh, you did?  Do you have any kind of, uh, catapults, uh, I could play ball with my grandson? 
[01:32:30]  They could, like, a pitching, uh, arm or something?  No, no.  They call my name's Bill.  Could you just come over and shoot me in the head?  No.  I mean, hell, I was big once, I was in the war, I was a commander, and now I gotta drive  on a three-wheel battery-powered scooter?  Yeah, that's sad.  This is degrading.  It is degrading.  Sam, could you just shoot me?  Could you take a goddamn gun and shoot me in the friggin' head?  No, I don't think so. 
[01:33:00]  Please, I'll come down, put my head under the wheel of one of the scooters, and hit go.  I don't think it would do anything.  Could you do that to me, Tony?  No, I don't think so.  They just hit me in the brainstem with a ball-peen hammer, Sam.  Could you do that?  No, no, I don't think so.  I mean, hell, I haven't been laid since the Kaiser was in Germany, for Christ's sake.  I have big bologna breasts.  I haven't seen a naked woman in 42 years.  That's a long time.  Do you know what that's like? 
[01:33:30]  My pants are up to my nipples, and I'm calling for a scooter.  Now, what's your last name, Bill?  I have a wraparound eyeglasses that I look like the friggin' Terminator, Sam.  I've lived for 85 years.  It's enough already, for Christ's sake.  Kill me!  Could someone just kill me?  My name's Bill.  They call my name's Bill.  Oh, Jesus.  My teeth just fell out. 
[01:34:00]  My friggin' teeth.  I spit my teeth out of my head.  Oh.  Kill me!  Somebody just kill me, for Christ's sake!  What country you from?  What?  What ain't no country I ever heard of?  English and what?  What?  English, mother f***er!  Do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  What?  Say what again?  Say what again? 
[01:34:30]  I dare you.  I double dare you, mother f***er!  Say what one mother f***er!  Hell time!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah, destroy, destroy!  Yeah!  What much?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, you should pick up a little CB horse.  This is...  Come on, man.  Remember the big CB radio craze?  Of course.  I was like in my early teens. 
[01:35:00]  And it was a way to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay.  Breaker, Breaker 1-9.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah.  Breaker for a radio check?  You're coming in four by four, good buddy.  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there like, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10, 10, 10-8 on the side waiting for you, good buddy.  There. 
[01:35:30]  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know...  I'm double nickels all the way.  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some pretty seat covers here today.  Down the old backpack keeper between the ditches, good buddy.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  I'm just on the CB.  What was your handle, Ant? 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  I got to explain this.  It's just never...  Explaining never works on this show, does it?  I was living in California at the time, and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse, and I used to ride, and my handle, because I ran a rent string.  This guy I knew had a rent string, so he used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton that  wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend, and to guide him up in the hill, so I was like 
[01:36:30]  the guide.  And I'd take them up there, and then go down, and backpack down the hill, and get the next  batch, and bring them up.  And so I was the wrangler with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy.  The foot wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust? 
[01:37:00]  Bang!  That's worse than...  What's Diamond Dust?  That's worse than Butt Wrangler?  It wasn't Butt Wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  Because a wrangler was a guy on a horse that got together the livestock.  Diamond Dust?  I don't know.  Hey, you got the Diamond Dust.  Hello, Diamond Dust.  Buttplug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story. 
[01:37:30]  What?  Got your guns on?  This is a rubber duck.  A rubber duck.  What's it?  Big fan, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  For sure, for sure.  Oh, God.  Clean, clear the flag.  Oh, God.  Oh, Big Tim's water.  Shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely got the front door.  Yeah.  We got us a convoy.  We got us a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks. 
[01:38:00]  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, it's a chick in a roller skate.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels.  Up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy taking pictures.  Giving away invitations.  I'll be, uh, be back.  I gotta go 10-100. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us a Tijuana taxi.  Whoa, I just got passed by a crazy man on a crotch rocket.  You better watch out for the Smokies.  All right, come on, everybody.  All right, all right.  Meet you up at the Chokin' Pupers.  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this, uh, this girl that I used to, uh, communicate with on the Citizens Band. 
[01:39:00]  And her handle was Dreamweaver.  You dick.  Oh, Rick had to get the song and everything.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  And she sounded hot.  Yeah.  So I invited her, uh, down to, uh, ride horses. 
[01:39:30]  It's a key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What do you look like, Ant?  Oh, shut up.  All right, go ahead.  So, so I was all excited for my little date.  And I saddled up, uh, my horse and, and the other horse.  And, uh, kind of shut up.  Dreamweaver.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll meet you down at the stable at two o'clock in the afternoon.  This is the Wrangler, over and out.  Dreamweaver. 
[01:40:00]  It's the whole side.  You're an ass, man.  And so, uh, all right.  So I saddled up my horse and I spent time, you know, brushing the horses, making sure  they look all good and everything.  And then I saddle up the other horse and I, I take the reins and put her on the saddle  horn and I'm, I'm, I'm kind of trailer in the other horse, you know, down to meet her  by the river bed where we were going to ride.  Well, well, she comes, uh, walking up and I see kind of in the distance like, okay, that 
[01:40:30]  must be her.  All right, now, wait, wait, now, you did say that you had the 10 and everything and you're  hoping to score in the woods, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I, I packed like a whole thing.  Uh, uh, saddlebags are all packed up with some, a couple of beers and I had bed rolls and  a tent just in case things went well, because we had a bunch of hills to ride up in and  stop.  I'm going to camp out with my dream weaver.  Hey, Mayweather, tell your mom, um, you're going to be, uh, spending the night, dream 
[01:41:00]  weaver.  Tell her, tell her you're at a friend's house, because we're going to camp out.  This is the Wrangler, over and out of 10, 10, 10, 8, on the side, dream weaver.  Looking forward to my little date.  Yeah.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was gravely disappointed, the horse that had a carrier looked pissed.  I wasn't sure if I should take the saddle onto the horse, put it on her and let the horse  ride her.  Dream weaver. 
[01:41:30]  She was huge.  Dream weaver.  All the money you can get me.  Dream weaver.  All right.  Yes, I was, I was gravely disappointed.  Dream weaver.  Are you, are you a Wrangler? 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  Please don't be dream weaver.  I'm dream weaver.  All right.  Let's, let's go for a ride.  So we, we went like, uh, up and down the riverbed for about an hour.  I was like, Oh, look at the time here.  I had like bed rolls on the back of this thing.  It was like, I was paw Ingalls going up to the Walnut Grove.  I was going to go over the river for a week to go get supplies for the family. 
[01:42:30]  I mean, I had this thing packed out like a pack mule.  You were ready.  I was like a prospector.  I had crap hanging off the horses.  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready.  I was ready to rock.  Dream weaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt their food and I realized looking at it, I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know, we used to hunt.  We'd hunt little rabbits and stuff.  Feeding the heart would be, forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison left on the plane. 
[01:43:00]  I could live off your thigh for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed because she's talking that she, you know, oh, yeah, I look like Tatum O'Neill.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her, you know, let her off and she rode off into the distance.  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do a drive-by on horseback?  Well, what, I'm the only guy with two horses, one empty? 
[01:43:30]  Are you wrangling?  No.  No, just looking for another girl.  You should have tried to, like, meet her in town or something, did the drive-by.  The whole thing was riding up like Clint friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You've got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like, maybe 13 years old.  And this was mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me, this was in San Juan Capistrano, California, a very equestrian town. 
[01:44:00]  Used to ride.  This was what we did, you know?  And I'm, like, you know, I had firearms on me.  I swear to God, I had a pistol.  Just in case I had a fight for her honor.  For any bandoleros.  Meanwhile, they'd have been, you keep her.  We don't want her.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was, like, I was so pumped up for this.  And so was she.  Pumped up. 
[01:44:30]  But, yeah, it was very disappointing.  But to bring it all back to the beginning of the story, she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed at her in a while.  My eyes are teared.  This song brings back memories every time I hear it.  I got to tell you, to this day, when I hear Dreamweave, I think of the whole day, how happy I was and psyched and how disappointed I was riding back to the ranch that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story, Ed. 
[01:45:00]  Thank you.  It won't be.  It won't be.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I had the image in my head again of Al Roker eating sushi.  Yeah, we had some sushi today before the show.  Went to lunch, had some sushi.  Go to the little sushi place.  Yeah.  And Al Roker comes walking in.  Is that the funniest thing ever?  Al Roker eating sushi?  Like, hey, look, it's Al Roker, man.  And he was sitting at a table right across from us, like right next to us, kind of. 
[01:45:30]  And I had a good view of him.  You know, we go to that place a lot, and a lot of people around the station go down there, and they always told us, yeah, Al Roker's in here all the time.  Yeah.  Al Roker.  Al Roker loves his sushi.  And we're like, shut up, Al Roker.  Sushi.  Al Roker eating sushi.  Who are you kidding?  What, the Twinkies wrapped in rice?  What the hell kind of sushi is Al eating?  So he walks in today, and I was busting out laughing.  Yeah.  So, of course, everybody's looking to see what the hell Al gets at a sushi place.  Right. 
[01:46:00]  What the hell is Al Roker going to eat?  You know?  I think he ordered the baby seal.  They give him his own room in the back.  Yeah, where he could just, like, bat it around with his fins.  A few times before he swallows it.  Yeah, you've seen how they do that.  Yeah, they bat around the seal a little bit and play with their food until they just swallow  it whole.  Swallow it whole.  Swallow it whole.  Mm-hmm.  Everything.  Go right down.  That's what it looked like. 
[01:46:30]  It looked like when the shark ate Quint out of the boat.  Al was tipping up the big sushi train.  And he's done.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  A little tenderizing.  Swallow your own.  I'm watching Al Roker eat sushi.  All of a sudden, his eyes roll back white.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Ah, and then you hear the horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering. 
[01:47:00]  Damn, was that funny, man.  Al Roker eating sushi today.  Nighttime comes.  Al Roker comes cruising.  You hear the horrible high-pitched screaming and they just keep going down and Al Roker  just keeps his pounding and pounding.  Water turns red with blood.  Al Roker comes back.  And he keeps pounding and pounding.  Three hundred and fifty pieces of sushi went in. 
[01:47:30]  None came out.  Eleventh day of October, 1999.  See the scar I got here?  Al Roker.  I had a piece of sushi.  He fell on my lap.  He bit me.  You go in the cage.  Cage goes in the water.  Al Roker's in the water.  Our Al Roker.  I'll never wear a life jacket again. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, that's too good.  We made sure we ordered real fast before Al, uh...  Oh, my God.  Al ordered his sushi.  Look out, Al Roker's coming.  Farewell and adieu to your very Spanish lady.  I don't know if anyone else finds this funny, but... 
[01:48:30]  Al Roker can't go down with three barrels in him.  Come on.  You haven't seen funny until you see Al Roker eating sushi.  For God's sake, I wish he had it on video.  Look, this is not the time or place to perform a half-assed autopsy on Al Roker.  I'm not going to cut him open in this sushi place  and watch that little Kittner boy spill out all over the floor. 
[01:49:00]  And he thought we were star-struck.  No, we were looking at what you were eating, Al.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, that was...  I swear to God, that was some of the funniest stuff  I've ever seen in my life.  Smacking him around.  Al Roker at a sushi bar.  Smacking his baby ceiling. 
[01:49:30]  Hello!  O.P. and Anthony.  One is funny.  One is sex.  I hated my grandma.  Bitch.  Precious this.  The O.P. and Anthony.  I nailed it, man.  I go, oh, Anthony broke up with a girl.  Look at their girlfriend, huh?  Yeah.  I'm back.  Oh, is that what happened there, Anthony?  Annoying laugh, Anthony?  Yeah.  It was pussy whips.  The girl he was going out with didn't like the show,  didn't like how he was portrayed on our show.  I knew it. 
[01:50:00]  So does Anthony, you know, stand up to his girlfriend  and still hang with his pals?  No.  She folded like a sheep chair.  I knew it.  Bailed out.  She took care of my son, bro.  Come on.  You know the deal.  Get another babysitter.  How would I know that deal?  Oh, you know.  I have sons all over the place, of course.  I know that deal.  You've got to put your foot down, dude.  If a girl doesn't like the show,  you just sink it into her dumper  and make her listen anyway.  CNN bosses tell reporters it's okay to cry like Dan. 
[01:50:30]  Okay to cry like Dan Rather.  In the old days, there was no crying in news.  Baseball.  Oh, in baseball.  News, right.  In news.  You could not have an anchorman or anything that was crying.  Now, with the events of September 11th,  it seems like it's okay because Dan Rather got on.  David Letterman.  David Letterman.  And just grabbed Dave's hand like poor Grandpa  after he took the car out and crashed 
[01:51:00]  because he's losing his mind  and opened up to him and cried.  Kind of like, you know,  how you have to comfort Grandpa  after Grandma dropped dead of a sudden heart attack  Christmas Eve.  Yeah, just fight back the laughs  while he's sitting there crying.  Oh, jeez, man.  So, CNN News Executive Chris Kramer says  reporters should be allowed to show emotion  while covering the war in Afghanistan.  And he calls reporters who don't show any emotion  as being from the old fart school of journalism  who are in denial about the hours they're witnessing. 
[01:51:30]  What?  The old fart school of journalism.  Where is that?  Yeah, that's SUNY Geneseo, yes.  Is it?  Yes.  With Professor Bobo.  Went to the old fart school of journalism.  Hmm.  I don't want to see some blubbering idiot read the news.  I know.  It was acceptable because it was real.  Read the news.  Be stone-faced.  I don't want your opinions.  Read it.  But, you know something?  These guys are fighting over rating scraps.  Yep.  Over this war.  And, again, Rather grabs some headlines. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  CNN boss tells reporters it's okay to cry like Dan.  To cry like Dan.  Like Dan.  Not cry like anyone else.  Tom Goka, NBC Nightly News.  Again, Dan Rather making headlines.  Making the big, bold prints at the top of the page.  With the fact that he started weeping openly.  I thought it was kind of babious. 
[01:52:30]  I thought it was kind of amateuristic.  Like, because I'm a stiff-ass, solid anchorman.  Yeah, but, Tom, it's...  I don't believe you should be a pooh-ha.  Yeah, but it's helping his ratings, Tom.  With the Dan Rather crying on Letterman.  Well, I don't think this has not gone unnoticed by me.  Tom Goka, NBC Nightly News.  I think it's time I show the people I have feelings like a human. 
[01:53:00]  And I go home and drink some scotch.  Feelings like Dan Rather.  Hey, you know something?  Dan Rather.  I can show people I'm just as emotional as Dan.  Dan Rather kicking your ass because he's crying all over the place.  Okay, I didn't want to have to resort to this, but now I feel it's necessary.  Yeah?  That I show my human side.  You're going to show your human side?  Yeah.  On the Nightly News?  What the...  Tom.  I brought my VCR and some videotapes.  And I'm going to show that Tom Goka, NBC Nightly News can be... 
[01:53:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on, Jack.  Hold on.  Rose, please hold on to Jack.  Don't let him slip beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  Much like Leon Klinghopper off the deck of the Achille Laro.  Another terrorist event which happened many years ago to an American tourist. 
[01:54:00]  Tom, do I see a tear in your eye?  If only she'd move that fat ass over on the portal.  Well, maybe Jack could not.  They'd both go.  Look, I'm crying like Dan.  Grab me a clean...  Get me a tissue.  Well, never.  That's so sad. 
[01:54:30]  See, I'm crying just like...  Damn, s***ing rather.  Tom Jackson.  Look on the screen.  Jack is turning blue.  He's turning blue.  Oh, no.  They had such a love.  It was so short-lived.  Yet so strong.  They're feeling for each other.  On this faithful night in April.  It was like that.  It's all broken.  So, every scene night later, it was just so crazy to cry. 
[01:55:00]  Get me the dailies.  How are we doing?  I'm up 0.3.  Popping another tape.  It's working.  Well, okay.  Dan Rather, I'll show you.  I could be just a big pussy.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Look at...  The spirit had come back and protected her.  He came back. 
[01:55:30]  Death didn't overcome the love that they shared together.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Tom, I didn't...  I didn't know you were into ghosts.  Oh, it's so sad.  It's moving.  It goes by.  So, slow, slow, slow.  Not fast.  Look.  Like his spirit's right in front of her, touching your face.  And that single, to me more, tear that rolls down. 
[01:56:00]  Jake!  Oh, no, no.  God.  Okay.  Stupid.  How am I doing?  You're doing all right.  I'm up another point, too.  Dan Rather.  I could be just a big a pussy.  I'm a human being.  Tom Brokker, NBC Nightly News.  Wiping the tears from my eye.  From this very romantic, very moving chick flick. 
[01:56:30]  Showing you real emotion today.  It's what seems to get the rating.  What the hell are you putting in the VCR now?  Well, I'm just loading up another one.  Let me.  Look.  Look.  Tom, you all right over there?  No, this is my favorite.  Oh, no.  Tell us what tomorrow brings.  I love the love story. 
[01:57:00]  It's all present in the Jedi.  When Richard Gere comes in at the end and realizes he loves her, Debra Winger, and sweeps her off  with his feet like a knight in shining armor, I lose it every time.  Here comes a part.  He opens the door and everyone starts clapping as he brings her.  I got nowhere else to cry. 
[01:57:30]  I got nowhere else to cry.  I got nowhere else to cry.  He opens up.  Love, dexterity.  Love, dexterity.  Here comes Mayonnaise sweeping around his feet in the paper factory wherever he wants.  You want the paper factory?  I got nowhere else to do.  Okay, I'm doing well.  Give me another tape. 
[01:58:00]  All right, how about this one?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Your daddy saved you and your man.  Your daddy made sure that your love returned to you  and saved the world and sacrificed himself.  Oh, Liv, Tyler, don't cry. 
[01:58:30]  Leave that show, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I didn't know you were an Armageddon fan.  I love that movie.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Oh, God.  You got just a couple more movies there, Tom?  Ow, I do.  Oh, no, no, not this one.  Oh, my God, not this one. 
[01:59:00]  I knew this.  Oh, God, no.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  It's a lion, kid.  It's a lion, kid.  It's a lion, kid.  It's a lion, kid.  It's a lion, kid.  The circle of lava.  The circle of lava.  The circle of lava.  The circle of lava.  You know what I'm saying.  Oh, God, dammit. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I can't take that.  You're a real new one, Mr. Brokaw.  Can't you feel the other side?  You need a glass of scotch?  I need one, yeah.  Run, run Simba, Scar's trying to kill you.  Give me another, give me another one. 
[02:00:00]  Give me another, give me another tape, give me another tape.  I'm just working.  All right, all right, all right.  Oh, my God.  You're starting to catch up to Dan Rather.  The chick.  Oh, God.  This is the bodyguard.  Kevin Hosner is, you can tell he's a professional bodyguard,  yet you can see his love for Whitney Houston. 
[02:00:30]  But he had to keep his professional attitude, but he loves her.  He loves her.  I'll think of you.  I will always love you.  Oh, I will always love you.  Oh, God.  Here he comes, here he comes.  He's all running through the snow to the cabin to save her. 
[02:01:00]  He loves her so much.  I can't think.  How did I do?  Where are the ratings?  Let me look.  Oh, it's a ratings bonanza.  People seem to enjoy the whiny Tom Brokaw.  All right, Tom.  My darling in the middle.  Oh, my darling in the middle.  Tom Brokaw drying his red eyes on this NBC night playing here. 
[02:01:30]  You really have it out for Mr. Rather, Tom.  I've proven that I threw him a crybaby.  Yeah.  And now if a CNN boss wants to say, crying's okay, hey, f*** you.  I just put my heart out of my sleeve.  For the love of God. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, I'm a professional anchorman, but you could suck my f*** if you think I don't cry.  I cried.  I'm one of the biggest pussies around.  I'm a pussy boy on NBC Nightly News.  If you don't think so, you could f*** me right up the f***.  I swear to God, I'll take it.  I'll take it and I'll cry.  A single sphere will roll down Tom Brokaw's eye.  As you f*** me with your big f*** right in my f***. 
[02:02:30]  Alright, Tom.  We get it.  We get it.  Why are you putting it on the tape of the VCR?  We're done.  We're done.  Well, see, you brought up Rather and I lost it.  So now I have to get back to...  No.  Oh, no.  You did it, baby.  You did it, baby.  Nobody puts baby in a corner.  Look, they did the lift move.  They did it.  They practiced it.  And they practiced.  And now she's showing her father that she's a woman now. 
[02:03:00]  She's a woman.  And so is Tom Brokaw.  Oh, f***.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, baby.  You did it, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, no.  Shove your daddy.  You're a woman, baby.  Oh.  I'm so proud of you.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[02:03:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Join us tomorrow for NBC Nightly News.  As I watch Tears of the Terms of Endearment.  One and two.  All right.  We get the point.  You're a human like Dan Rather.  I'm human.  That's right.  Maybe we could have got the point a little sooner. 
[02:04:00]  Mr. Brokaw.  Hey, I could drill this into the ground another ten minutes ago, let's say, but I won't.  Ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No please, don't put on Richard Jennings, C.D.,  that's the saddest thing I ever heard .  HA.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You put yourself out there.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:04:30]  Good afternoon.  Hi, I'm going to be in the Nevada area in about a week.  I got your pleasure menu.  Could you hold on a minute?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sorry.  I have Tourette's syndrome, which makes it hard to communicate. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, no problem.  Do you need prices, hon?  Yes.  Okay, well, house minimum starts at $100.  That's for a basic one activity party.  $100.  Wow, that's pretty cheap.  That's where the prices start.  And then from there, the sky's the limit, because all the ladies are independent contractors.  You don't think the girls would mind being with a guy with a...  That's no problem, hon.  Handicap's no problem. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, good, good.  So I can come down and, you know, get a girl and climb aboard and start going...  Well, you have to come in and discuss that with the lady.  Okay, so for $100, could I put my head between her...  Could I do that?  Yeah, I'm not allowed to discuss that on the phone.  You have to discuss that with the lady, okay?  Oh, I just want to warn you that when I get in the room and things get hot and heavy, I can get a little wild. 
[02:06:00]  You know, when I get...  Is that okay?  That's no problem, hon.  Oh, do you take...  A mess card?  Yes, we do.  Could I bring a muzzle so I don't clamp down on anything I shouldn't?  That's fine.  Do you think a girl would mind if...  When I start...  She spanks me. 
[02:06:30]  You have to come in and discuss with the lady.  Are they pretty women?  Very pretty.  This might sound...  Work your time, okay?  This might sound like a strange request, but...  Do you have any...  Girls that aren't that attractive, babe?  All of our ladies are very nice.  I have...  Jungle fever.  Do you have any...  Black girls?  We have black ladies, we have Asian ladies, we have Oriental ladies. 
[02:07:00]  It just depends.  I have to go now because I'm very busy.  Do you have any...  Do you have a dwarf?  Um, no, we don't.  Not at this time.  Because I saw a dwarf in a movie once and it made me...  Goodbye, okay?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Kofi and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut. 
[02:07:30]  A four-hour parade of meat.  102.7 WNEW's best of 2001 continues with the best of Ron and Fez.  Oh, Fezzy, I just saw someone in the back.  I can't believe it.  Your favorite intern.  Hey, put it!  Put it!  Put it!  Put it!  Oh, God, put the blindfold back on me and get it on me.  Ron and Fez, Nights, 1027.  WNEW. 
[02:08:00]  It's Opie and Anthony on the juice, 1370.  I don't know.  It's just a generic fat, porno, hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the former...  It was just telling a story.  Oh, I thought...  Oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  That's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass on the door to the studio. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  And you talk that way.  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something?  How are we going to have Ron Jeremy in?  That was really funny, that thing yesterday.  It was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It'd be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old. 
[02:09:00]  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does.  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  We're so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  Then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show, because we're juvenile.  That's true.  Yeah?  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I'll be funny.  Oh, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here.  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Clinton.  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any knock-knock jokes? 
[02:10:00]  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock, knock.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Uh-oh.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny who?  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock, because I'm pistol-whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  Richard Jenny who? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, sorry.  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Both of you are just the worst host ever.  All right, hold on, Richard.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  What's up, boys?  On the air with Richard Jenny, who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Do yourselves a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday, and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did, but actually I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too.  Oh, he was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul, thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenny came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby, not for much longer. 
[02:11:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What is happening?  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff.  Come on, you're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right.  You're not having fun with this?  I'm funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny, and then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and  gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet. 
[02:12:00]  We'll have a long wait.  Richard, do you know what our show's about?  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the O.P. and Anthony show, Richard?  Nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No.  Are you from New York, or where are you from?  Originally from New York, yeah.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like Commonplace, and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had. 
[02:12:30]  Are we on the air right now?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  What?  You thought this wasn't on the air?  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm going to hang it up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Go see how that went.  He's right outside the door. 
[02:13:00]  What's the matter?  We were having fun.  Why is everyone coming in here?  What's up, stinky?  Stinky, what's wrong?  Nothing, nothing.  I don't fear for my life.  Is he okay?  Pacing a little.  Rick, go smooth things over, Rick.  Rick, you're the producer.  Take care of things.  No, we're going to go to the listeners and see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny, come here, sit down, man. 
[02:13:30]  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no, come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny, how are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh, he looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You'd spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right?  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  Just let's see how much we can screw a rip and drop.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger? 
[02:14:00]  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah, we're on the air.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  We've got a machine.  No, thanks.  Look what it did to you.  I know.  Would you like a beer or something?  No.  To listen up?  No, I don't need a beer.  No?  No.  It's not about needing it.  It's just, you know, you want to hang out.  Yeah, no, I don't drink.  You don't drink anymore?  I never started.  You didn't?  No.  You've never had a beer in your life?  I had a couple.  I've had beers.  I just never got a taste for it.  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  All right, hold on a minute.  Michael feels bad, too, now.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Listen, Richard, you're a real radio whore, aren't you? 
[02:14:30]  Well, me and your mom.  How many shows are you going to be on, man?  I mean, come on.  What's the problem?  What other shows would be on radio shit?  He's not funny, and he's, like, miserable.  He can't even go with the flow.  I mean, you know.  Well, we busted his balls the last two days, so.  Well, I mean, that's what comedians are all about, but I really like you anyway, man.  You're a good guy.  Thank you.  I don't care.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  Brian, what's going on?  Richard, I was thinking, just thinking back to some time when I was watching the UPN Network 
[02:15:00]  and your brilliant sitcom, Platypus Man.  Right.  Oh, that's right.  You were on that?  It did suck.  Well, no, finally somebody is, all right, I'll take that one.  It did suck.  Come on.  It was a bad show.  Did you see that, man?  But how big an idiot are you for watching it, though?  What do you have going on in your life that you were watching a show that bad?  Come on.  Stick a knife in your forehead.  Where are you from originally?  New York City.  New York City.  New York.  Brooklyn.  And you never made it out to the island when you were living here? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I did, but it was crappy then.  Right.  The governor was with a crappy club then.  Now it's gotten a lot better.  Now it's great.  Well, the beaches you went to out there, right?  You know what I did recently?  I went on, uh...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  For sure.  Opie.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies.  He, he's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Press and button.  Be more funny. 
[02:16:00]  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us and we can't take it.  I was listening, and Opie is a prick.  You don't have a sense of humor?  Can you say prick on the radio?  Yeah.  I say prick, sure.  People are changing it.  Really?  Yeah, you just can't use it in the context of a, um, a unit.  Right.  Like, I have a big...  Yeah, you could call someone a prick.  You could say, don't be a prick.  Okay.  But you can't say, I grabbed his...  Glenn.  And then use the word.  Glenn, what's up?  Oh, man.  You guys got to cut Richard Jennings a break.  We are.  The hanging up yesterday, and then waiting, having to wait out in the lobby. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, I haven't left this heart since Gary Coleman.  See, Nancy from Jersey.  Opie, you are such a rude, unfunny a-hole.  See?  See?  You're being bad to, uh, Richard.  See that?  All right.  People are mad at you.  All right.  What were you going to say?  I wasn't going to say anything.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  I'll be quiet.  We'll do it your way.  We're a big shot radio guy.  Let's not let him be funny on our show.  We're the funny ones.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We're only bringing the comedians to abuse them.  Don't say we.  I was being nice. 
[02:17:00]  I want to sit here.  I'm listening to what you're saying.  And we allow...  I hope he's being a jackpot.  We allow a lot of people to be funny on our show.  Yeah.  See, you didn't do your research.  We allow them to be funny.  Well, you know what I mean.  We allow them to be funny.  We have...  This is now officially turning uncomfortable.  We have this show, and people come in, and they're funny, and we don't care.  All right, okay.  All right?  So what were you going to say?  I forgot.  What were you going to say?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  What were you talking about, Ed?  I don't remember either.  You're being rude.  It was something about Long Island, right?  Yeah.  And governors.  Yeah.  And then you were going to say something.  I don't want to talk about this. 
[02:17:30]  Let's do whatever it is you do.  We don't do anything.  This is what we do.  We just sit here and do nothing for four hours a day.  We goof on people and make them feel uncomfortable.  That's our gig.  We have to abuse the comics.  No.  All right.  We're trying to...  We love the comics.  We've had a lot of comics on here.  We had Jay in here yesterday.  We had Jay.  We have Norton comes in all the time.  We've had Andrew Dice Clay in here.  Ron Jeremy's coming in a little while.  He's not a comic.  He's pretty funny.  He wanted to be a comic at one point.  He's got some comics. 
[02:18:00]  Have you watched some of those movies?  You watch his movies?  Yeah.  I've seen a couple.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen those back in his heyday.  Yeah.  He's great.  He's quite the guy.  He's...  I like...  I...  You know, people think that...  We should say this on the air.  That people...  This is a misconception that people have that men like porno, which is not false.  It's men's penises that like porno.  Right.  It's like any guy, no matter how stupid he is, he's going, this movie sucks.  It has a bad punch.  Any people, but the penis is going, it's genius.  It speaks to me.  I haven't seen performances like these in years. 
[02:18:30]  I must have it for my collection.  So I like Ron Jeremy.  He's a big, disgusting character.  Uh-oh.  Some people call him a hedgehog.  I got a porno dish.  A satellite dish that plays porno 24 hours a day.  Yeah?  Plays other things, too.  You like your porno?  You got a steady?  You got a steady gown?  You're never disappointed.  You never said they're going, gee, I didn't think it would end that way.  It was really good.  Right up until then.  Right up until the money shot.  And then the whole plot just fell apart.  What the hell happened there?  Tony Camacho, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Tony Camacho from Rascals in New Jersey. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Now, it's the only room that Rich is not working in the New York area and Jersey, whatever.  And I still got to say he's the funniest man on the planet.  There you go.  By the way, Tony.  The truth is go watch this man perform and then get some opinions because Rich is funny.  What's your act like?  I'm really, I haven't seen your stand-up.  Never?  Just like, no.  At HBO.  I saw him on HBO and stuff.  You are.  Yeah, he's very funny. 
[02:19:30]  You never saw me ever?  I swear, no.  You're the target demo, man.  I know.  I'm sorry.  You're an Italian guy from New York, aren't you?  I, I, I.  Are you Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  From Brooklyn.  Target demo.  Never saw the act.  It's, uh, you know, what can I say?  It's a rear act.  You stand there, you talk.  I stand there and I talk.  Is it filthy?  No.  No.  No.  Very clean?  It's a little filthy toward the end.  Yeah.  But the whole thing isn't filthy, no.  Okay.  No, it's not.  A lifestyle stuff?  It's, you wouldn't like it.  No?  It's not annoying.  It doesn't embarrass anyone. 
[02:20:00]  I like all forms.  It's not into humiliating anybody.  We like all forms of comedy.  Let's break them down like a rifle.  No.  We like Jim Norton, who's as dirty as they get, and we love Brian Regan, who's as clean  as they get.  And everyone in between.  Jay Moore and the rest of the guys.  So you just have to go through a certain amount of abuse until you get to be part of the Opie  and Anthony family.  Yeah.  I think we just got off on the wrong foot somehow.  I don't know how that happened.  That was Anthony's idea yesterday.  I don't know how that happened. 
[02:20:30]  I think it's maybe because we hung up on you, and then when you were here, we called you  from the lobby, which would be really funny if it wasn't happening to me.  Hey, I like that.  See?  It's always funny unless it's you.  Yeah.  It's always funny unless you're the guy.  Well, why don't we take a break and regroup?  All right.  We'll regroup, Opie.  And we'll, like, start over.  All right.  We'll start fresh.  If you start yelling at us, we're just going to turn the mics on.  I'm not yelling.  Yeah, be prepared, affiliates.  We might just pop the mics up. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, because if he's going to yell at us, everyone else has to hear it, too.  Right.  I'm not.  Richard, Jenny.  I think we should go to an Italian restaurant, all three of us.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And I'll forget my gun inside, and then it'll all be fine.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hello?  Yes, I'm calling.  Is it...  Yes, it is.  What can we do for you today?  Yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh. 
[02:21:30]  Because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What claim number did you get?  654.  654.  321.  321.  6J.  6J?  Yes.  Ooh.  Pretty excited, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You ever win anything before?  Never win anything.  Hold on, please.  Oh, okay.  Dude, tell us you won a European vacation.  Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation. 
[02:22:00]  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I wish I were you, as a matter of fact, because it's a European vacation for your family plus  $10,000 in spending money.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you psyched?  Yeah.  I'm, like, shaking.  This is, this is, oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hold on.  We have our supervisor here.  Okay. 
[02:22:30]  He's going to need, I guess, some information, maybe.  Hold on.  Hi, ma'am.  Yes?  Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor.  Can I have that number once again, please?  We've got to verify that you are, in fact, the winner.  Yes.  It's 654-321-6J.  6J?  Yes.  Oh, I thought you said A, John.  You thought, I thought it was an A.  Oh.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in, uh, jump.  Oh.  We've got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay. 
[02:23:00]  But, uh, your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  Oh.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the, uh, steak knives.  Oh, all right.  And that's $19.95.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh...  Uh, no, thank you.  Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  Well, thank you anyway.  Okay.  Oh, that was way too painful, man. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, poor girl.  Are you bastards ready to rock?  Opie and Anthony.  And you'll actually find them rubbing the feces on the wall.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Psychotic apes.  Is it for shock factor?  Oh, my God!  He went back to sleep and I'm howling because I've been caught many times.  Ooh!  Yeah, Opie got caught, uh, recently, uh, spanking it by his girlfriend.  We ran in rush hour because I never saw him when it was on Twitter.  But I couldn't call in. 
[02:24:00]  I couldn't call in.  And, uh, well, I'll just refresh everyone's memory because I, at least I have someone on  my side.  Come on, every guy has.  Yeah, but no one around here would admit it.  Every guy has.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I have never been caught.  You are being sexually harassed from the moment you wake up in the morning by your chick.  I swear to you, I've never been caught.  Bro, this is the third time for me.  Oh, it's been at least three.  It always causes big fights.  She flips out.  Really?  And I thought she was asleep because I looked, you know, you start with, like, you start 
[02:24:30]  slowly, you know what I mean?  And then you're like, well, I've got to get some friction going.  Well, what happened?  So, so I, I turned around because she was on the couch.  I've got some friction going.  Well, at first, like, oh, hey, look at this.  This feels nice, you know?  That old cartoon.  And then.  So at first, you could be in the mode, like, I don't want to be bothered.  Too much work, maybe.  And then the second you're getting into it, it's like, why am I not doing this all the  time?  Why am I not quitting my job and doing this full time? 
[02:25:00]  So when it really started, you know, I started getting into it, I looked behind me to make  sure, you know, she's still asleep.  And she was asleep.  Would you give her a little peek around?  Would you give her the fish eye?  Oh, yeah.  I turned around.  Yeah.  I was hoping with the fish eye.  Oh, wait a minute.  You got to understand.  She was two feet.  She was two feet behind me.  You're very quiet.  You get a quiet method.  And then we got.  You're quiet.  Just a real giant method.  Thumb movement.  Just maybe like the inside right here, like the wrist area. 
[02:25:30]  Thumb movement, light movement, and pressure with the pinky, ring, and middle finger.  So then I adjust the pillow.  I'm getting all set.  And I look behind me.  I'm like, all right, she's still asleep.  And now it's time to get down to business.  I guess I was shaking the whole room because she woke up.  Well, you know what happens?  Well, Joe, because we have, like, all these stupid things in my living room.  And some of the crap is.  Well, what happens in this situation?  It's sort of like going.  You know when you start drinking?  You don't realize you're drinking and having a good time.  So you start talking like this? 
[02:26:00]  Yo, I got to take your beat.  Do you see the Mets?  Why would you bring up your beat, guys?  He sucks.  He sucks.  So when you start getting into that thing, it takes over.  You're getting into the zone.  Right.  You're doing it right here.  So we got on the air the other day.  That's Chris Rock, by the way, that talks about the nobody's home jerk.  What does he say?  What does he say?  You get in the good nobody's home jerk where no one's home.  You can go to town. 
[02:26:30]  You can go to town.  You can do whatever you want in whatever room.  You can do the roast beef.  It don't matter.  Nobody's home jerk.  So it turns out.  That is a good jerk. 
[02:27:00]  When nobody's home.  The nobody's home jerk.  Ow.  Ow.  I've been shaking in the bed like a crackhead.  But it's okay because nobody's home.  I've been putting pillows together, making it look like a ass. 
[02:27:30]  And I've been doing the home jerk.  I've been banging.  I've put up other pillows, make them watch.  Say you're next.  I've put a satin pillow on the pillow kind of jerk.  I do every room in the house.  I don't care if no one's home.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge. 
[02:28:00]  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  On my donkey.  I'm going to get a donkey bottle kind of jerk.  I'm doing it in front of the TV.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  I've got pillows and how it is.  I'm going to hunt that.  Nobody a home jerk.  Come on, man.  Joe Rogan.  You ever hear that, dude?  Yeah.  He has a bit where he goes, the worst part about when you're playing, when you're doing the donkey, is you're like, and always when you finish, it's always like, what's wrong with me? 
[02:28:30]  You've got your donkey in your hand and just, what's wrong with me?  So what happened?  Nice head, dude.  To make a long story short, I thought I was safe and, you know, did the thing. 
[02:29:00]  It turns out when we got standing on the air, because she, I thought she caught me, but we didn't really want to talk about it around the house.  That's what you're talking about.  So I figured I'd bring it up on the air where, you know, it's a little safer to discuss things openly.  And it turns out that she did open up her eyes during the whole thing, and she was scared at what she was seeing, so she made believe she was sleeping for the rest of it.  So she has to sit there.  Good for her.  And make believe she was sleeping.  Good for her.  What to do.  What to do. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  All right, Brewer.  Wow.  Now let's get back to the job.  Oh, you're not off now.  Oh, come on, man.  We're past that.  Now I told my whole story, and you were listening, you were listening in the car with your lovely...  See you later.  ...your lovely wife.  Make sure you write us in a week.  We'll come back to the...  Grandma to the ramp.  No.  Why do you have to put your glasses on for this, so I'm sorry. 
[02:30:00]  Because it's embarrassing.  It shows me.  They don't want to look people in the eye when you're talking about being a filthy animal like that.  Filthy animal to yourself.  Cranking it.  You know how embarrassed you feel the second it's all over.  So you're in the car with your wife and your grandma listening to this crap.  Yeah, I'm listening, and I want to call, because I instantly started laughing.  Actually, Dee laughed even harder.  Because for...  I'm married eight years, man.  We've known each other a long time.  You do a lot of donkey playing. 
[02:30:30]  A lot...  There's a lot of times when you do it.  Well, a couple times I almost got caught, and she'd have a talk with me.  But a similar...  You look like your mom.  You really got to stop doing that.  If you want to, just come to me.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, all right.  Hi, how are you doing?  Listen, can we do it right now?  Because, you know, I want to.  Yeah.  And the time I got caught, the one big time, it turned into a big fight, because she turned... 
[02:31:00]  First of all, you feel like a dick that you caught.  You feel like a dick.  There's nothing more humiliating.  I will take stepping in human feces and bare feet.  Or you're standing there naked with your donkey in your hand, and you have another human being.  You're white.  Looking at you in disbelief, like, what is wrong with you?  Yeah.  So, I instantly took the defense. 
[02:31:30]  And I went, nothing.  I try to play it.  Oh, no.  So, I went, nothing.  I'm just, nothing.  Just like, so, there's that weird barrier of, am I going to get away with this?  No.  Can we just drop this?  Because you really don't want to go to battle here.  You were dressed, though?  Like you had something on?  How did you cover up?  The pants were off.  How did you cover up?  I couldn't.  I just, I jumped on the side of the bed.  I was next to the bed.  So, I leaned down like I was trying to take a nap real quick. 
[02:32:00]  I was napping.  I'm napping.  This is a labor excuse that I'll be.  Well, you had no excuses, though.  Well, you had no excuses.  You said, well, how do you get out of this?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Sleeping.  So, I lay down, and she's like,  So, there's that tense moment, like, please, you know what's going on.  She says, drop it.  Drop it.  All right?  Let's make believe we didn't happen, okay? 
[02:32:30]  So, what it, you know, and there's that weird moment, and she goes,  Are you playing with yourself?  Oh, no.  That's not, I'm really mad right now.  Oh, like, you're not humiliated enough.  I'm really mad.  I go, what, why are you mad?  She goes, that really offends me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So now, you know, this is when you lose it.  Oh, no.  This is when you go, well, it shouldn't offend you.  Well, it does.  How does it feel?  I'm standing here in front of you.  Do I, do I never give it to you? 
[02:33:00]  I mean, how wrong is that?  And you feel the need that you have to hide on me and touch and play with yourself?  That's disturbing.  Let's not forget, you're naked.  Yeah.  Let's not forget.  So then I...  On his side, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And then, first you take the, first I took the argument of, um, I attacked her like this.  I said, well, I didn't want to bother you!  Because you said you were tired last night because the baby got up early. 
[02:33:30]  What'd you say all day?  You got mad on me.  As soon as I woke up, you're like, I'm eating that today.  And I let you nap.  Did I not do that?  Yes, I did.  Turn it around.  And I said, you were really good.  And so, you said you were tired.  You went downstairs.  You said you were tired.  I thought you took a nap.  So I started playing myself.  No, all right?  Is that all right with you?  I'm trying to help you out.  You're making me feel like a dick.  I'm so true.  You guys know what I'm talking about.  Yes, I do.  Oh, try to spin it.  You try to spin it and get out of it. 
[02:34:00]  Turn it around.  But my wife, she knows me.  Look, the only human being that's ever going to know you your entire life better than you is your wife.  And the reason you get so pissed at her is because she's so on and right, but you don't want to face it.  So she goes, you didn't even think.  You know what?  I wouldn't be offended if you at least tried.  But you didn't try.  You just decided you're going to go up and play with yourself.  Why didn't you agree with your family mutton?  I'm not taking that route.  Yeah, well, you're there yelling at your wife now, just sporting naked, and you're sporting, and you're just standing there now. 
[02:34:30]  Like, is that pretty much takes you about five ticks down on the advantage scale, you know?  You're done.  Arguing naked, bad.  And what sucks for me is I've got three, I have weird room.  Oh, no.  It sounds worse than it is, but there's three mirrors.  Yeah.  It sounds way worse than it is, trust me.  So I've got two angles on me so I can see myself. 
[02:35:00]  And then I realize this while I'm caught in the middle of this whole thing.  Were you able to pull covers over yourself?  Look at me.  Oh, no.  I quickly, once we got over to the thing, I quickly put up my, you know.  But now she's standing there as you're putting pants on.  Yes.  Oh, my God, is that horrible.  No, I can't look at myself.  I lose.  I'm like, oh, baby, look in Mirror 3.  This reminds me of the dude in American Psycho when he's banging those two chicks, but he's  looking at himself in the mirror while he's flexing his thighs.  That's hilarious.  Huey Lewis and the News. 
[02:35:30]  This is Susudia.  This is Phil Collins.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  There he is.  The color is bone.  Bone.  Bone with a font that I picked.  I love that movie.  You've got to tell the last part where she caught you in the...  Which one?  After you did the concert and all that, and you're, you know, a little...  Which one?  What?  I need better language here, Ope. 
[02:36:00]  Help me out.  He's like, you know, if you guys could see Ope right now, he's just leaning his head to  the right and going, you know, when you...  That was my usual for, like, you know, being high, like, being a little under the...  Oh, my God.  Then you've got to deal with it.  Well, when you were downstairs, like you said, jamming, like Judas Priest or something,  giving yourself a concert and then decided...  Oh, no.  Exactly.  Exactly.  When I got some spare time, you always revert back to being 16. 
[02:36:30]  Always.  Yeah.  You know, Chris Rock, you're out of a second.  You've got to have a...  We call it the Rob Halford Jert.  Scream in the Dungeons!  Nothing better than the Rob Halford Jert.  Now, that's a good British digger, says.  Run to the hills kind of jerk. 
[02:37:00]  Rob Halford Judas Priest kind of jerk.  Wearing leather and a blue whip.  Now, this is what...  Talking about living after midnight kind of jerk.  This is like jerking after midnight.  There we go.  Jerking!  At the midnight!  Jerking!  To the dawn!  Till the morning! 
[02:37:30]  Then I'm gone!  I'm gone!  So you're having a concert with yourself.  Jerking!  Jerking!  Nice head, Pete.  See you again!  Jerking!  Jerking!  Wait, what's he say?  I come alive!  I come alive!  Yeah, he comes alive!  That's when my jerking goes all right!  At the midnight!  Jerking! 
[02:38:00]  To the dawn!  Fuck it off, Pete.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  The vine is going to get down when you're jerking at the Judas Priest.  You can't jerking if the music's too loud.  Jerking!  Jerking!  You're going to get caught jerking if the music's too loud.  I put that big ball in my mouth, and I start jerking like the jiff. 
[02:38:30]  And I put on it!  And I put on it!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Jerking!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  To the dawn!  To the dawn!  To the dawn!  When I'm home alone, 95% of the time I spend jerking!  Oh, here we go, wait!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I'm a gauntlet for you!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Wait, wait, wait!  What you're doing?  I'm gonna pull you! 
[02:39:00]  It's perfect!  Wait, wait, wait!  This has a good one!  Ah, my body's coming!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  There he is today!  Ah!  Landlord!  Ah, no, no!  I'm getting hotter by the hour, getting hotter by the hour. 
[02:39:30]  That's what I call the rock and roll dirt, and that's the good dirt.  When you get bangin' your head, leather of your spouse kind of dirt. 
[02:40:00]  We're talkin' love, fights, screamin' for vengeance, rubber gags, and zippers.  We're talkin' run to the hills, master of puppets checkin'.  Master! Master! Master of checkin' is pulling at me!  Jack from Philly checkin' in, he says there's no way out of it when you get caught beatin' it.  There's no way?  But there is a way to minimize the damage.  Look right in the eye while still stroking and say, 
[02:40:30]  Look what you're making me do!  Get down on your knees, start crying.  Look right now, man!  What have you brought me to?  I got no place else to check!  I got no place else to check!  Don't you make me stop doin' this!  Don't you!  I got no place else to check!  I ain't got nothin'!  And I believe that would be the close-up! 
[02:41:00]  That's the officer and the gentleman!  There's no man!  There's no man!  There's no man!  That's the Richard Gibbs jerk!  Oh, God!  Wow!  That hurt!  But, bro, you were under the influence.  You were jammin' Judas Priest or somethin'.  I can't get through this story, huh?  That's fine.  You're kidding.  Ah, we get the image. 
[02:41:30]  Oh!  Just the visual of your wife coming downstairs and there's a track in your eye naked.  Oh!  Dude!  I wasn't naked!  Was this before or after the other episode?  Oh, this is after.  Oh, this is after.  Oh, man.  So she must've been like...  Didn't we talk about this?  You have a problem!  Well, I honestly, what I did, I pulled that as a front.  I'm gonna say, I'm gonna get downstairs writing, you know...  Living at midnight!  Right.  Rock it like a rainbow in the dark!  Na-na-na-na-na!  Right, you have a whole concert.  Tearing it up in my basement.  And then, you know...  I wait until she...  I wait until she...  Oh, this is after.  Oh! 
[02:42:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:42:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Is there a problem?  I've got to go that route.  The problem, yeah.  Then now there must be a problem. 
[02:43:00]  That's it.  This is not getting better than that today.  There you go.  Bravo.  Wow.  I laughed that hard.  It's embarrassing, man.  But I usually get madder.  I'm like, well, you know, don't walk around.  You know that gets me out.  Well, can't you control it?  No!  I cannot!  That is why I've got to run in high.  It is worse than heroin.  When are you females going to realize that? 
[02:43:30]  It's a gene.  It's a fluid in our body.  You show us anything, and immediately it's like, where can I go?  Like an ape, yeah.  Throw my feces.  Come on.  You're all lying if it's not the truth.  No, it is absolutely the truth.  Oh, God.  That's too good.  All right.  How many people are going to do the Judas Priest jerk now?  See?  The Judas Priest jerk! 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  We better take a break, huh?  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I have a blast.  Too much fun.  And more on the way.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Viagra thing, though, we've talked about it in the past.  The guys love it.  They get a little older, and they're able to do it.  But the women don't have a drug for it.  You know, they can't get wet at Niagara Falls.  The old saying goes. 
[02:44:30]  But they are starting to say that the Viagra works on the women a little bit.  I don't know about that.  Well, that's what they're saying.  And they're all ready to go, the guys.  And what happens to these poor old women?  You know?  They're not ready for the company.  Let's say.  That's good.  What?  No, it's just like.  Well, you're talking about couples that haven't had sex in many, many years.  Many years.  They discover the Viagra.  Yeah.  And the guy's all ready to go, and the woman is just.  She's not prepared.  She's not.  Yeah.  For the visitor.  Yes.  She's not prepared for company. 
[02:45:00]  It's like if the woman was a house.  Let's just put it in those terms, okay?  You know, you go up to a house that's accommodating.  It's nice, right?  The lawn is well manicured.  Sure.  The outside's painted nice.  Oh, yeah.  Nice and shiny.  Nice.  The door works perfectly.  You ring the little bell.  Open the door.  Oh.  Oh, it smells beautiful.  It's a brand new house.  Yes.  Yes.  It's a brand new house.  Correct.  Guy's proud of it.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  He's out there all the time.  Bushes are all trimmed nicely.  Absolutely.  Bushes are...  The plumbing works.  Plumbing works just fine.  No leaks.  Don't have to call in a plumber.  Everything's fine.  There's no cobwebs in the attic or anything like that.  No leakage from the roof.  You go down into the basement.  Mm-hmm.  It's not musty and moldy.  No.  Not at all.  It's a new house.  That's right.  Everything is working just fine.  Ready for company.  Sure.  If they could drop it at any time.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  No, it don't matter.  Now you get the guys taking the Viagra. 
[02:46:00]  They're older women that they're bedding with.  They're not...  That house isn't ready for company.  It's not the same house, right?  The shutters are...  They're falling off the house, aren't they?  Sure they are.  Oh, the whole foundation's a little saggy.  Oh, the paint's chipping.  The paint's chipped.  The lawn is all overgrown with weeds.  Oh, all over the damn place.  Oh, but you can barely open the door.  It's creaking.  Don't even...  Has it been opened in how long?  Get back to the lawn.  You don't even know where the driveway is anymore.  You can't even see it.  It's overgrown all over the damn place. 
[02:46:30]  The plumbing.  Forget about it.  Yeah.  Leaking.  Matt, you try to open the door to get in.  What do you smell when you open that door?  Oh.  When the dust clears, it's just all musty.  Well, it's an old house.  Some rats could have died in there, you know? </pre>
