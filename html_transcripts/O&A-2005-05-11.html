<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recap of their experience at a Rolling Stones press conference.  They detailed the challenges of getting press passes, described the band members' appearances (Mick Jagger's fitness contrasting with Keith Richards' gauntness, Ron Wood's makeup and wig, and Charlie Watts's age), and mocked the quality of questions from other journalists, particularly a young fan's question about Mick Jagger's "sexy moves" and Jagger's response referencing the fan's mother.  Audio clips from the press conference were played.  The hosts also lamented their financial losses from a Citadel stock investment and Opie recounted a bizarre encounter with Peter Wolfe out of character.  A caller, Earl, pitched a radio show idea featuring black rock artists, sparking a discussion about the merits of remaking classic films.  The entire segment was liberally punctuated with profanity and crude humor.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Colin Quinn's acting career, specifically criticizing his role in *Rock Bottom*, and the inaccuracies found in online biographies, including a guest's purported incorrect death date. This led to a harsh critique of Adam Sandler's remake of *The Longest Yard*, comparing it unfavorably to the original and generally expressing disdain for contemporary film and television using strong language.  A significant portion focused on a go-kart accident involving Tony Danza and Rusty Wallace, with the hosts playing news clips and mocking the news anchors' reactions with crude and offensive language.  Their opinions on various television personalities were shared, including scathing remarks about Ellen DeGeneres' dancing.  Listener calls followed, one requesting a t-shirt and another anticipating a gruesome injury during the Danza segment discussion.  The hosts then discussed Don Imus, sharing anecdotes about his past and current radio show.  A listener, Pat from Minaki, detailed a humorous plan to advertise the show on his van, including liability concerns and a story about a stolen MiFi device. The discussion then moved to *American Idol*, focusing on Von Zell's emotional breakdown and Ryan Seacrest's handling of the Paula Abdul scandal, before returning to their analysis of the Rolling Stones press conference and Matt Lauer's presence. The reasons for older rock stars continuing to tour were debated, rejecting a suggestion of "inverse racism".

The next segment started with what appeared to be an interview or press conference segment highlighting the hosts' playful antagonism.  A caller made a joke about John Lee Hooker's death. The conversation then shifted to Comedy Central's censorship (specifically the bleeping of "trenchcoat") and speculation regarding the cancellation of *Chappelle's Show*.  A story about comedian Bob Kelly's knee injury during a football game followed, with a sound clip of the injury and graphic descriptions of the pain.  Numerous listener calls offered advice and anecdotes.  A large portion detailed the arrest of Florida weatherman Bill Kamali for soliciting a minor online, with the hosts discussing the case details and implications, using crude humor and sexually explicit references.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Bob Kelly's injury and recovery. Musician Sandy Kane was a guest, along with numerous listener calls.

The show then focused on a purported email from Jerry Seinfeld ("not you") before playing 50 voicemail messages from a woman to her ex-boyfriend, detailing erratic and desperate attempts at reconciliation, including self-harm and infidelity. A caller, Sally from Illinois, expressed disgust.  This transitioned to a discussion of Sandy Kane, a public access television personality and former peep show performer, who was scheduled to appear in the studio.  The hosts graphically described a large genital wart ("Twado") she possessed, comparing it to various things. Bob Kelly, also a guest, reacted with visible disgust and nausea.  The graphic descriptions and Sandy's display of the wart caused Bob Kelly to vomit and leave the studio.  A Gamefly.com commercial aired during this segment.

The final segment featured Sandy Kane performing her song, "Shove It Up Me," while engaging in sexually explicit and vulgar conversation with the hosts and Bob Kelly, who was still present despite the earlier incident.  The discussion centered on Sandy Kane's pubic hair, willingness to expose herself, and a dildo she intended to use in her performance.  Clips from her public access show were played.  The segment culminated in a partially clothed performance by Sandy Kane, with significant effort made to get her to remove her remaining clothing.  Robert Kelly's website and Sandy Kane's public access show were promoted.  The show ended with a rushed goodbye and further sexually suggestive remarks.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it goes!  Here it goes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  I want that back.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  Syndrome children.  Don't do it!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, good Lord.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  Okay, terrific.  It's impossible. 
[00:05:00]  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  Mom!  I love it, Lord.  I have to do this now.  Rupert.  I love that one.  Rupert.  Mom!  Mom!  Please stop calling me.  Mom!  I love it, Lord.  I have to do this now.  I love that.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart. 
[00:05:30]  All right, we're starting.  Shut the fuck up.  It's the only virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  I think this satellite radio thing is going to be the next big thing, Anthony.  Yeah?  You think it's taking off?  That's what I'm thinking.  It's like the hula hoop.  Just like it.  The hula hoop.  A little tired this morning, man.  Are ye?  Well, you guys were out gallivanting with the Rolling Stones yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we went to the Rolling Stones press conference.  Ah, you guys out there with the Rolling Stones.  Ah, me.  I was hanging out with Barry Shapiro talking about my finances and health insurance and retirement funds.  Yeah, we have people around us that just live a different life than Anthony and I, and I'm sure Jimmy as well, because we haven't talked to you about this. 
[00:06:30]  But we don't care, man.  These guys are opening up like, I don't know.  I don't even know, like, uh...  They're a bunch of little accounts.  Little accounts to save $2,000 here, $1,000 here, all legally and stuff.  Of course.  But it's like, why don't you call us and let us know how we can save a big chunk of money?  This is their job.  It's like they go through all these, these, I don't know, like, all these little things to save a grand or something.  Dude, I was looking at formulas and graphs. 
[00:07:00]  He came over with this stack of papers with pie charts and colored graphs and acronyms and plotting of diversification of your portfolio,  where you see these square boxes with X's in them, and then little dots in the corners of the boxes that represent high-risk, high-yield, low-risk, low-risk, low-risk. 
[00:07:30]  And he's going on, and I'm sitting there looking at this, just going...  You ever get too much information in a situation like that where your brain just decides to shut down?  It shuts down to the point where I'm looking, going, his briefcase is brown.  Like, I'm just staring, like he's talking, and I'm like, look at the latch on that briefcase.  It's like a gold-type, yeah, what? 
[00:08:00]  It's so true.  Yeah, no, I get it.  I'm understanding.  I've been in situations where you're following somebody and what they're saying, and they give you more and more info, and your brain is...  It just can't keep up at all.  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got...  You lost me.  You lost me, and then all of a sudden you just hear white noise.  Yeah.  Oh, look, that's an ice cream cone.  See, you want your alpha number to be low, because that is the volatility, but your beta number, you want to be high, because that... 
[00:08:30]  What?  What?  Alpha...  What?  Did you ask him the most important question yesterday?  What was that?  How to take our Citadel stock and make it a good thing?  Fareed, you fuck.  That's what you should have said to Barry.  Fix this.  Fix this problem.  Take this and make me some money, and then I'll be impressed.  You want to make fun of me and Opie?  Just check the Citadel stock, CDL. 
[00:09:00]  Check it on a daily basis and laugh along with us.  Yeah, laugh and laugh.  That plummet into nothingness.  It's at an all-time low.  It's in the 11s now.  We got in at 19, I think.  19 on the IPO.  Woo-hoo!  19 on the IPO.  Thank you.  It's safe to say that Anthony and I were banking on this one.  I was hoping this would be the one, Opie.  Yeah.  I was hoping.  We got together, Anthony and I, on our cell phones, and we're just going back and forth, going, this is a good thing. 
[00:09:30]  How much are you going to throw in?  Oh, please.  Oh, well, if you're going to throw in that much, I'm going to throw in that much.  Well, I'm going to top you then, and I'll put in this much.  And what are you going to do with all your money?  Oh, please.  I'm going to be on a beach somewhere in the Caribbean.  It's safe to say we are taking a massive beating from that stock at this time.  Ugh.  A massive beating.  Yeah.  So that's what I was doing yesterday.  That was my afternoon.  Right when I got home, Barry came to the door, and that was it. 
[00:10:00]  He really, really loves his job, too.  He certainly does.  He just can't get enough of it.  He was just talking about insurance, like health insurance.  It's a big issue, isn't it, with everyone in the country.  He knows everything about it.  He came over with sheets of papers that spelt out all kinds of benefits for health insurance from all kinds of different companies.  And I'm going through them, and he's like, I bring over all these just so I can show you what's available so you can make the choice, 
[00:10:30]  instead of me just going, this is what I think is the best.  And meanwhile, all I want him to do is show me what he thinks is the best.  I don't want to know.  Like, this one doesn't really offer that many participating doctors.  Well, then I don't want it.  Give me the best one.  You know what he should have done?  He should have just, like, color-coded all of them and held it up to you, and you go, blue is pretty. 
[00:11:00]  That's what I was going to get at.  I like the blue one.  The blue color is pretty.  Right.  I want blue insurance.  Give me blue insurance.  Because in the end, we don't know.  Just tell us.  Yeah.  Just tell us.  Unbelievable.  That's very funny.  Yeah, we went to the Rolling Stones press conference yesterday after the show.  Yeah.  It was an all-day affair.  It took all day.  God.  It took us, what, an hour, hour and a half just to get into the press conference? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, and that line on my black sweatshirt and my stupid jacket was awful.  Oh, yeah.  Ben and I are in T-shirts, and Jimmy shows up, and just made us all uncomfortable.  Why?  It was like 70 degrees out.  It was an outdoor thing, and Jimmy's got the...  The Richard Pryor black heavy sweatshirt on.  The weather is a little wacky, though.  It's chilly in the morning.  I think it's hot.  And then it gets hot in the afternoon, and what is a man to do?  Well, I asked him as we're sitting on and standing on the line. 
[00:12:00]  I'm like, Jimmy, do you check the weather ever before you go out of the house?  You were dressed like it was going to be, like, 40 degrees yesterday.  I know.  I never do it.  I never even look out the window.  I just leave.  If it's raining, I'm like, ah, why didn't I look out the window with an umbrella?  So we're just waiting on line with all the other schmucks, thinking we're somebody.  Heavy security?  Not really.  No?  I just hate playing that game.  I just hate it.  What?  Being like real people?  There was heavy security for the band.  Huh?  There was heavy security for the band.  Hence when Jim went running over trying to get his photo. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I know you did.  I certainly did.  But I knew I wouldn't.  My thing was this.  After that great shot in the post, by the way, when they're all walking over the stage,  they had massive security with them.  I just wanted Ben to take a picture.  You might be able to get them for a second.  Like you in the foreground and them in the background?  Or if you go, hey, Mick, did you, and they might look at you, and you go, cheeky, you never know.  You're trying for a phony photo op.  Of course I am.  But it was so, the security, they walked by really fast. 
[00:13:00]  There was no way to do it unless you had, like, you know, the type of things you photographed safaris in Africa with.  Running horses.  Yeah.  This is known as the suburban boob failing to get a photo with four legends.  And I was trying to talk to him, but I'm like, uh, Mick?  Ron?  Oh, could you touch their arm?  No.  Not even close.  No, huh?  The security guard, who I think rode over on the roof of a car, if anybody remembers that cartoon, was kind of keeping...  Was, uh, kind of scolding me. 
[00:13:30]  Get back!  Get back!  And I backed up like a half a foot, and then the other guy came over and goes, he just told you to get back, and you didn't get back.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's starting trouble.  No, Jimmy doesn't start any trouble ever, because he's always paranoid he's going to get kicked out of the event.  Oh, yeah.  Was he just the whole event thinking you're going to get thrown out?  Yeah, he was, I mean, he was, you're all right.  I had a little bit of a reason to be nervous, though.  You've been worse.  I get there, and we're all in line.  Well, I got to just say real fast, we're all waiting to get in, you know? 
[00:14:00]  And, of course, they're telling everyone with a, you know, a camera, a video camera, to get to the front of the line, because they want the video to go all over the world.  Jimmy has a serious problem with this, because he's all pissed off, because there's a lot of these people that were behind us in line.  We're just going in to watch.  Well, I guess we're talking about it on the air now, so it is helping the cause.  But, in general, you know, we weren't there to help the cause.  We were just there to just, you know, check it out, basically, and maybe get a photo or whatever. 
[00:14:30]  So, you know, all the videographers, they're telling to come to the front of the line and get through, and Jimmy's just like, of course.  Oh, boy.  Getting all mad.  All cranky.  All cranky.  Like, yeah, of course.  I figured this would happen.  And then, after that, they go with the, well, and then they go with just the regular photographers, you know, the paparazzi and the magazine guys that are shooting photos.  So, Jimmy's still pissed off.  I'm like, Jimmy, come on, stop.  And then we finally get in there, and, of course, there's a problem. 
[00:15:00]  Of course.  We're supposed to get three press passes.  There were only two there for us, for Ben.  And then I, Hughes and Sparks, and it was like every event, every high school thing, every grammar school thing.  What?  No little Jimmy Norton on that list, huh?  Dude.  We have a badge for Jimmy Robinson.  Helen's just coming.  A little Jimmy Norton.  Mick is asking for Helen.  Anthony, you walk up to the table, and you give your names and what company you're from, whatever, and there's a whole bunch of envelopes. 
[00:15:30]  You know, you've been in this situation, right?  Sure were.  And they're thumbing through the envelopes, and they get, oh, Ben Sparks, and then Ben's like, there should be one for Hughes and Norton.  Here's Hughes.  And then there's not much left in the stack of envelopes.  And I'm just playing.  I'm like, oh, for the love of God, please have an envelope for Norton.  Because we all know how he is.  Oh, yeah, he'll just lose his mind.  And sure enough, they get to the back, and there's none, and all of a sudden, Norton's like, figures.  I know it.  I know it. 
[00:16:00]  I know it.  It's supposed to be a diversion of records, too.  There's a couple of options.  There's a couple of options.  So thank you for whoever at Virgin was supposed to do it for nothing.  So then all of a sudden, they're like, well, maybe we could get you in.  Why don't you wait until everyone else is signed in?  And at this point, the line is still at least 100 people.  And so now we're standing there waiting when we could be up where the press conference is going to be and stargaze and check everything out.  And we're just standing there with Jimmy like, oh, God.  So you guys are kind of secretly pissed because you don't want to wait.  Of course.  And then at one point, I go, we're waiting about five, ten minutes, and all of a sudden, I go, hey, uh. 
[00:16:30]  I want to go check this out.  I'm going to check it out to see if we can maybe work something out here.  Yeah.  So I walk through the security guard guy that's checking.  I go up there.  And I'm hanging.  And I'm really debating if I'm even going to go back down to help Jimmy.  Well, I look up, and I see you looking over the ledge relaxing.  I'm like, what?  That doesn't seem like he's really seeing how it's working up there.  It seems to me like he's relaxing.  So then we came up with a little scam to get him in. 
[00:17:00]  Knowing that, we had three unbelievable seats reserved for us.  That was the other thing, though.  It said Opie and Anthony on three seats in the fifth row.  It was like a concept, though.  He comes down with Opie's pass and brings me up.  Yeah.  It always has to be some kind of scam going on.  Yeah, like we're 16 again.  We're sneaking a pass to him.  Yeah.  And then me and Opie, Ben had to sit between us at the Opie and Anthony seats.  And they're like, every time someone comes in, we have to lean in because Ben's got his jacket zipped up so I don't see that he's not wearing a badge.  Yeah, because we're in the fifth row.  We forgot to mention that. 
[00:17:30]  The fifth row.  We're right there, dead center.  Dead effing center.  And so we sit down, and Matt Lauer's there, and that was kind of cool to check out.  Peter Wolfe, of course.  Peter Wolfe was there with his wig.  Oh, it wasn't the wig.  That was very natural.  Yeah, sure it is.  Oh, my God.  His wig and hat.  I had an uncomfortable moment with Peter Wolfe.  I was telling you guys, Anthony and I flew out to L.A. for one of those Grammy junkets.  And we were staying at the Sunset Hotel there. 
[00:18:00]  What was it called?  Just Sunset.  The Hyatt.  Hyatt, right.  On Sunset Boulevard.  And he was staying there because remember he flew out?  Yeah.  And, you know, after you're done with your broadcasting and stuff, you go to the hotel, whatever.  Then maybe you walk down to Starbucks that's pretty close to there or whatever.  So I hit the street, and I turn a corner, and there's Peter Wolfe, I swear to you.  If he wants to sue me, well, so be it.  But this is what I saw.  I saw Peter Wolfe without the glasses, without the hat, and without the wig. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  Bald as could be.  Oh, boy.  And we made eye contact because we talked on the plane, remember?  Yep.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's Peter Wolfe without all his stuff on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What was he doing out without his stuff?  I guess he was, honestly, unless you just talked to him, like, five, ten minutes, you  know, prior or on the flight like we did, you probably wouldn't think twice about it.  You would just think it's some guy, some bald guy, whatever.  But we made eye contact, and it was obvious that I knew that it was him, and it was, like, 
[00:19:00]  it was a really awkward situation.  But he had his wig on yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's awful.  You got a photo with him, right, Jim?  Yes.  Yeah, that's just like getting a picture with the Rolling Stones.  Rolling Stones, Peter Wolfe.  He really was the next step down.  There was no one else there.  Matt Lauer, I don't care about.  Yeah.  There was a big step down.  It was the Rolling Stones and then Peter Wolfe.  Peter Wolfe.  Yeah, there's a few people in between there.  That would have been cool, right?  Yeah, anybody.  Anybody.  And then we're sitting next to all sorts of radio guys. 
[00:19:30]  The gang from YSP was behind us.  Oh, yeah, Cousin Ed and another guy he was with.  Yeah, Cousin Ed's cool.  Tim Savian.  Tim Savian calls Cousin Ed.  He's the PD at WYSP for the new listeners.  Yeah.  And Tim Savian absolutely loves us, wants us on WYSP, but the company just can't see it still.  Tim's great.  So I talked to Tim and he's like, why don't you go on the air with Cousin Ed?  It would be so cool, blah, blah, blah.  And then he talks to Cousin Ed and goes, make sure you don't get him on the air. 
[00:20:00]  I'll get fired.  So he's playing it both ways.  Like he's the cool PD, you know.  Why don't you just jump on the air with him?  Yeah.  Don't put him on the air.  Yeah, and then he tells Cousin Ed, make sure you don't put him on the air.  And we're really good friends, you know, when we're not doing this stupid radio crap.  Then all of a sudden it was time for the show, right?  Yeah.  And you don't forget, Earl came in and of course Earl sits with us in the Swiss media spot.  Oh, that's right.  You never got kicked out of that.  Yeah, Earl comes down in the fifth row, black Earl.  And the seat to my right is reserved for like the Swiss media, some Swiss media station. 
[00:20:30]  So I look at Earl, I go, unless you start bleaching your skin real fast, someone's going to know  if you're sitting in the wrong seat.  The worst seat you could possibly steal.  Exactly.  The Swiss media.  And then he has to tell me, there are black people in Switzerland.  There's not.  Yeah, show me one.  Show me one.  There are not.  So then the curtain drops down.  And we're right in front of the stage, right, Ann?  You know, five rows back. 
[00:21:00]  I'm stupid me.  I'm thinking, oh, wow, this is going to be great seats.  You know, fifth row, the stage is right there.  They drop the curtain.  Now you have to look up about 30 feet to see them perform.  They are so freaking high up there.  It was the weirdest thing, wasn't it?  So you could see them like way in the back, all the people that they had that weren't in the press area.  It's a really weird area because the press area we were at is very high up.  But you have to go down a flight of steps to get to the next level where the public, the regular, you know, non-important people.  There were thousands of people outside the press conference. 
[00:21:30]  Thousands.  There were people on the roofs.  It was really, really cool.  So those people could see?  Because I'm thinking no one else could see except for the people in the press conference.  Oh, no, you could see fine because the stage was so high.  What about the canopy?  That didn't block the view?  Nah, it might have been from a rooftop angle.  But if you're on the ground and you're looking up, there's a big wall.  You have to walk up the steps.  But if you're on the ground, you're looking up at a gigantic wall and then the press area is above you.  So if they were to put that at, like, floor level for the press area, no one down at the bottom would have seen it. 
[00:22:00]  But because they raised it up high.  Wow, they had it figured out pretty good then.  Yeah, it was smart.  Oh, okay.  Because I'm thinking it was a waste of time for all those people.  They weren't going to see anything.  No, because I saw the stage when we were down there.  And we were down that area getting the media passes I looked up.  Yeah.  From the back, you could see the stage well.  Yeah, as long as you were beyond that pool.  Right.  Yeah.  So then the Stones did three songs.  They did Start Me Up.  They did a new song called Oh No, Not You Again.  Which was great.  It was a cool song.  It's very poppy.  It's going to be a hit.  It'll be a radio hit. 
[00:22:30]  No problem.  Even though I guess the CD's not even done yet.  And then they did Brown Sugar.  They did three songs.  Oh, yeah.  But the guys, well, let's take them one at a time.  Let's start with Mick Jagger.  62 years old, Anthony.  Could still kick anyone's ass in the room.  Really?  His arm, he was so jacked up, it was scary.  His arms were jacked.  He kept like, he wanted to take his shirt off.  They're talking about it in the New York media.  Wait, give me the post really fast. 
[00:23:00]  Is the headline Wrinkled Rockers Return?  How many times I heard that on the news last night.  Oh, really?  Andrea Pizer, who we saw there, who said getting old was a drag flashing swatches of his absurdly  flat bare belly like a preconception Britney Spears and humping his skinny hips treacherously  close to Keith Richards.  Geriatric rocker Mick Jagger yesterday wowed New York like a porn star one quarter his age. 
[00:23:30]  So he wanted to show his abs because he's just ripped at 62 years old.  It reminds me of when Opal lifts his arm.  It's like you look down and the shirt lifts up and you're like, look, the area between  the top of the pants and like, it's just like, jeez, that's really, really good shape.  So the guy, I mean, he's just in really, really good shape, Mickey.  Then you go to...  And his voice, by the way, was phenomenal.  Dude, he was running around the stage. 
[00:24:00]  It was amazing.  Yeah, he sounded great, man.  And then Keith Richards, he's just skin and bones.  Not a hint of muscle tone with a beer belly.  I've never seen this in my life.  He does have the body of E.T.  Yeah, he's a mess.  He looks like an alien.  His legs are so thin.  His arms are so thin.  See the bones through the skin.  No joke.  And then he has this beer belly happening.  Then you had Ron Wood who came out looking...  But to go back to Keith, though, his guitar playing was right on him. 
[00:24:30]  He was ripping it perfectly.  Yeah, he did...  Well, I mean, Jesus.  I mean, he could do brown sugar in a coma at this point.  Well, he has.  And then you had Ron Wood who had...  That had to be a wig, right?  Or something.  Yeah, Peter Wolfe was out of sight when Ron Wood was on stage.  So I think that one of them forgot their thing.  Ron Wood had a...  Trading wigs.  Yeah.  He had a wig on, then kind of a lime yellow top on with a scarf attached to it. 
[00:25:00]  Ooh.  With, like, morgue makeup.  Anyone else notice how creepy his makeup was?  I noticed.  Yeah, like some kind of weird pancake makeup that made his face, like, even yellowish.  Wow.  Or maybe that was, like, his top there.  And then Charlie Watts.  What can you say?  I don't even think he's going to make the first night of the tour.  He doesn't dye his hair, though.  You've got to respect that.  A lot of people were looking at him like, how is this tour all over the world with the 
[00:25:30]  Rolling Stones?  Because he's the old...  About 60, what, 4, 65, something like that.  Oh, so you know Mick's hair is probably just that gray, too.  You know?  But it's real, though.  He's got a big head out.  Yeah, no.  Like, gray.  Yeah.  They dye their hair and stuff.  So they kicked ass, and then they came out for some questions.  And, uh...  It's so rigged who they give the...  I know they have to.  And he's...  Jimmy getting all pissed off.  It's like...  Because, no surprise, a question from USA Today, New York Times, Rolling Stone Magazine, 
[00:26:00]  MTV News...  MTV News, and, of course, it has to be little Jimmy Norton.  And BBC, but I wanted to ask a question.  I had a question I wanted to ask.  You know what, dude?  We messed up.  Why?  Because they had people going around as you raised your hand, you know?  And they're trying to see, you know, where you're from.  Where you're from.  We should...  Some...  Like, CNN, something.  I don't know.  Something that might have worked.  Because Jimmy got really close to asking the famous, you know, question that he does. 
[00:26:30]  I just wanted to ask about the energy of the show.  It was amazing to see these guys have the energy.  And I wanted to say, energy, you guys have such energy.  Do you attribute that a lot of the times because of, like, we have something like today,  and then you just got to come up there and do this?  What the fuck are you saying?  Well, there was one Mexican guy.  Oh, we have that.  Keith Richards was really funny.  Oh, we got all that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can start playing some of these clips.  They're really short from the press conference yesterday that we went to.  I think Mick looked at me once, though, while I was waving. 
[00:27:00]  Listening to the newscasters last night, too, talking about this, they all, like, come  back from the clips, and they're kind of rocking and tapping their pens.  Yeah, this sure does rock.  Yeah.  Like, trying to remember what it was like.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to go to one of those shows.  I'm going to go see that.  The Rolling Stones.  No, you're not.  We're rocking.  We're rocking.  I got to tell you, if yesterday was any indication, they could easily still do it.  Easily.  Well, the fans were great, but, of course, the area we were in was all press. 
[00:27:30]  And the fucking industry, no performer wants the industry there, because you're a bunch  of deadweights, but you just sit there.  Yeah.  Tapping your fucking two-hipped-to-be-there legs.  Right.  You know, as the Rolling Stones are performing, and the whole front eight rows and 50 wide  is dead, is enjoying it, but nobody wants to show any emotion.  We didn't stand up, because there was cameras behind us.  You couldn't, because you could do it with filming.  It was just so annoying.  Matt Lauer's there with his fucking suit jacket and his jeans. 
[00:28:00]  That's a nice look in 1986 in fucking South Beach, you idiot.  Yeah, he was tapping his feet.  He was tapping his foot.  Yuck.  Oh.  I'm sure he'll have something very interesting to say on the Today Show this morning.  Yeah, foot tap.  It was nice to see him just be a civilian.  All right, here's some Spanish guy asking a question to the Rolling Stones.  Listen to this.  All right.  Hi, guys.  Alberto Armendariz from Reforma from Mexico and La Nación from Argentina.  Hi.  You're, buenos dias, you're once again going to Latin America.  I was wondering what it adds, what it gives to you as a band. 
[00:28:30]  What's the inspiration that you find there?  And also, what's the name of the new album?  Well, whatever you said, yeah.  What do you think of the fans in Argentina?  Argentina, I'd love to go back.  Beautiful.  Fantastic fans.  Fantastic fans in Argentina.  Brilliant, loud, masculine, noisy, football-loving. 
[00:29:00]  Enthusiastic.  Yeah, and many of them, and we're very happy to go there.  Meanwhile, Mick's knocked up about how many girls from that area, like how many little kids  are there that he has in South America.  Seriously.  That's his mecca.  Yeah, exactly.  Of course he can't wait to get there.  I love it.  I love it.  I was looking at Mick, and I'm like, this guy has just banged the hottest woman in the  world.  I mean, he's just a, it's not a stretch that Mick Jagger's a rock star, but you look at 
[00:29:30]  him and you go, this is a fucking rock star.  Like, this is what.  Yeah.  I just played legendary rock star.  Anything.  Any chick's accessible to him.  Anyone.  This was the question that was asked, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Tony Senecal, Channel 11 News, right here in New York.  I was out hanging with some of your fans, and one of them had a question.  Her name is Shanna Valdemar.  She's 17.  She's been a fan ever since she can walk, and she wants to know, and I quote, where did  you get those oh-so-sexy moves? 
[00:30:00]  I've got to learn to run.  Off her mum.  Hello, hello, hello.  Woo!  Shanna!  Off her mum.  Hello, hello.  You've got the sexy moves from her mum.  Off her mum.  Which was...  That's where I got them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck it.  I fucked her mum.  That's what a fucking waste of time.  Oh.  Feel-good question, you non-journalist.  She's all like happy.  The biggest rock band in the world, and you ask that cute question to get a sound clip on 
[00:30:30]  your dumb show.  Where do you get those sexy, those oh-so-sexy moves?  Well, this is what's interesting, to see this whole process take place in front of us.  So that was how we answered that question, right?  It's really no big deal.  And we were there.  Everyone pretty much laughed, like, oh, that's kind of cute and funny, whatever.  You know, this Andrea Pizer from The Post, she writes her whole article based on that  question that was asked.  Yeah.  She says really fast.  And then as the Stones came out to answer questions, a cringeworthy moment arrived. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no.  A local TV reporter relayed a burning question posed to Mick by a 17-year-old girl who'd evidently  skipped school to hear the Stones play.  Where did he get those oh-so-sexy moves, the child wanted to know?  Members of the audience shifted in their seats as if faced with the mental image of Michael  Jackson, a choir boy, and a well-oiled game of Twister.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:31:30]  Oh.  She's good.  But Mick swallowed the bait without chewing, not missing a beat.  He said he learned the sexy moves about which the young girl asked off her mom.  Onlookers grew quiet.  We didn't grow quiet.  No one grew quiet.  Onlookers grew quiet.  The subject was immediately changed.  No, it wasn't.  We were all just having fun.  Everyone there was just having fun.  They got a laugh out of it.  I think Mick is mentioning the fact that they're obviously so much older than this girl, 
[00:32:00]  so he's kind of relating to the mom's age.  And so who cares?  It wasn't uncomfortable for anybody except you, stupid.  Because you needed a story for the post this morning.  There was nothing going on there.  No one cared.  It wasn't even that outrageous.  It was obviously just a silly little joke.  Right.  How could Mick answer that?  All right, let's answer seriously.  Where did we get our sexy moves?  Well, from dancing a lot.  How do you answer that?  I feel the music.  And, you know, to look like I'm not just standing in front of a microphone on stage, I move around. 
[00:32:30]  It wasn't a real question.  It was more of a statement that she'd love to make a statement just to get some attention,  but she couldn't because that was too obvious.  So she had to form a question.  It's a non-answerable question, of course.  Where did you get your, and I quote,  Oh, so sexy move.  I don't know.  Where did you get your oh-so-fucking-phony TV voice?  Idiot.  She was expecting a big applause when she said,  Channel 11 right here in New York. 
[00:33:00]  And it got a zero, and her fucking cornball question did, too.  Exactly.  Let's go to Pete in Miami.  Pete.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Pete.  Hey, who's playing bass with them?  Daryl Jones.  Daryl Jones.  He's been playing with them since Wyman left.  Okay, yeah.  Because all the clips, they never show the guy.  It's like, that guy's the lifelong side man of all times.  I mean, in all the pictures, it's the Stones, and there's, like, the black dude, right?  Yeah.  And visually, they make it clear that he's not part of the band, I got to tell you. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Because all the other guys were dressed like, you know, quote, rock stars in their rock star uniforms, what have you.  And then Daryl was off to the side, off to Keith's left, in the back, in a suit.  The guy's going to have a tombstone side man.  So, I mean, visually, you're looking going, oh, okay, he's not really part of the band.  He's just going to help it out.  When did Bill Wyman...  Piped in, you know.  Yeah.  When did Wyman leave?  After, I think, after the Steel Wheels tour.  Before, that was 89, that tour, and then Voodoo Lounge was a few years after that. 
[00:34:00]  He left after 89?  But I'll tell you one thing, Daryl Jones does fine financially.  They take care of him.  He does all right.  He doesn't get the chunk they get, but, I mean, he does fine.  They're trying to bring an outside bass player into the band.  A bass player?  Bass player.  Cook.  All right.  Any of these clips, any of these other clips worth playing, Ben?  I don't remember.  We have the Canadian question, the cash, final tour, tax reasons. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, the tax reasons, idiot.  That guy.  Oh, that's BBC.  Yeah.  This is a little Brit.  Yeah, listen.  Dry and dull.  Yeah.  Yeah, listen to this winner.  Hello.  Two more questions, she said.  Steve Evans from the BBC.  You're quoted as leaving Britain for tax reasons.  Where are you, Mr. Tax Reason question?  This sounds really boring question you're going to come up with now.  Only an Englishman can come up with one of these questions.  I'm a Welshman, actually.  Got it here.  You're quoted as leaving England for tax reasons because you didn't want to pay the tax and rehearsing in Canada for tax reasons. 
[00:35:00]  We love Canada.  We would never rehearse there for tax reasons.  How much is money driving you, and how much is music driving you?  Wait.  Let's get a big question.  It's not a very popular question.  We're going to pass on that silly question.  You can have the money, pal.  Better than the oh-so-sexy news question.  You hear the rest of the media, though?  Oh, God.  I didn't like it either. 
[00:35:30]  Because the Stones have money, man.  I mean, these are the Stones.  I mean, he was just trying to be a real journalist.  You always want more money, though.  Yeah.  If you've got money, there's always the quest for more, a lot of people.  It's a dick question, though, and he was doing it to be a dick.  It is a dick question, but it's a legitimate question.  Maybe, but he was trying to be the guy who didn't get caught up in the rock star moment.  He's a stuffy English twat.  Yeah, he really is.  He's a twat. 
[00:36:00]  The problem was, though, I mean, the questions for what do they answer, maybe 15 questions?  There wasn't anything.  There was maybe one question about the set list, what songs they're going to play,  or about they're going to have seats inside the stage.  No one ever knows what to ask at these things.  Jim does.  Yes.  Yeah, well, that would have been a treat.  We came so close, man.  I was so close.  I was ready to get up there, and you guys, the energy, and then finish whatever it was  up with, and then just boom.  I'd love to have had that dead silence.  What the fuck?  All right, let's get Black Earl on the air. 
[00:36:30]  Earl, what's up?  Brothers, what's happening?  Brothers, my brother.  You nailed it right on the head.  This is my second press conference, and the questions just seem to get stupider and stupider  as the years go on.  I'm more and more stupid.  Stupid.  Stupider.  Stupider.  It's early.  I'm sorry.  But Jim was absolutely hilarious.  Every time they would ask one of these really dumb questions, he would rip out this really  loud, obnoxious laugh. 
[00:37:00]  Hello.  Hello.  Thanks, Earl.  Yeah.  Earl?  Yeah.  Did you have fun at the press conference?  I had a lot of fun.  You get the pictures I sent you?  Yeah.  You were passing as a, what was he, Swiss?  Sweden?  What was the seat from?  He was passing as a Swiss, swiggy, Swiss.  Hey!  How about the guy that's sponsoring the tour of the cut-up? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I met a question.  Yeah, they had the guy, this corporate guy gets up, and it's just like, he just bombed  over and over again.  Yeah, he was coming up with those cute corporate jokes.  Do we have that?  That's the stuff we need to play.  He comes up and he goes, now, how is insurance, what was it?  How is insurance, like being a rock star, some awful question, everybody wanted him dead.  That was one thing we were universal on, even the BBC guy behind us.  Yeah, it was just really bad.  And then the guy from Rolling Stone asked him about the, because he said something about 
[00:38:00]  commercials being aired during one of the tours on.  Yeah, he's a jerk.  And then the guy from Rolling Stone asked him, and Mick's just like, that was a joke.  Right.  And I just totally slammed the guy from Rolling Stone.  Okay, everything that's wrong with regular radio, okay, I'm sitting next to some guy babbling.  That's Pierre from MMR.  We kicked his ass when we were on regular radio.  And what he's doing, well, this is why.  They introduced a new song, Mick's like, we're going to do a new song, and I hear him going,  a brand new song by the Rolling Stones.  And they're playing it, and it's good, and he fucking just won't shut the fuck up. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, God.  Shut your fucking mouth, you regular radio guy.  And you fucking hear it.  The whole, just trying to hit the post on a song he's never heard.  How about this?  Here's the new Rolling Stones song, I'll Shut My Fucking Face.  I'll say one thing.  You're looking at the latest painting from an artist, and this ass is like standing in your  way, basically.  It's got to be about him.  Right.  And I guess he's taping for his radio show back in Philly, so of course, regular radio, 
[00:39:00]  these idiots get nervous if they haven't talked in a minute or two.  Of course, so like, all right, you're listening to the, shut up, and let it play.  He wouldn't shut his, I will say one thing, though.  He was one of the guys who was really into the music.  Like, he really is a Stones fan, obviously.  Yeah.  He was kind of annoying me.  He was moving around so much.  But I respected that.  I'm like, at least he's not some stiff shirt like the rest of these assholes.  But he wouldn't shut up.  Oh, he wouldn't shut his fucking mouth.  God almighty, I hate that.  I used to hate when I tried to tape songs off the radio. 
[00:39:30]  And they would just keep yapping and yapping.  Let the music play.  No one is going, ah, let's tune to another station.  This is only the opening guitar riff.  Right.  Oh, here's the guy.  Okay, here's the guy.  Let's listen to the guy.  Fucking out-of-touch idiots.  It was funny.  All right, yeah, play that last one.  Let's see what this one was about.  Have you made any, has your account made any projections yet on what kind of cast you will  be bringing if you make a sellout tour?  How much money we bought?  What kind of projection you'll have in terms of cash flow? 
[00:40:00]  I love it.  Keith just chimes in with those in millions.  Keith just says like this, he just comes from way out of left field.  I'll play the final tour thing because Charlie Watts jumps in and basically said, yes, this  is the final tour because he just can't take it anymore.  Oh, you see, he's also, he's just going through cancer and, you know.  Cancer?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's had a rough, rough time of it.  I think throat cancer.  Earl, where does he have cancer? 
[00:40:30]  Uh, throat cancer.  Yeah.  Through smoking or you don't know?  Uh, don't know.  Wow.  All right, here's another who cares clip.  Cordelia Kretschmar from GMPTV in Britain.  Each time you do a tour these days, over here, each time you do a tour these days, people  say it's your last one.  Is this your last one?  Yes.  Well, every, Charlie, we never, Charlie might say, but I, you know, we don't really plan  the tour as a second, this is the last tour and we certainly don't announce the tour as 
[00:41:00]  the last tour.  I think that's, that's a trap, trap to sort of, uh, try and get other people to buy your  tickets and say, well, I'll never see them again.  We, we never said this is going to be our last tour.  We never think about it.  We, we take each tour as it comes to, uh, pre-order, please, I wrap.  Hi, um, yeah, I mean, uh.  That's a good question, though.  Yeah, Mick Jagger will be doing this for at least another 10 years, with or without the  rest of the guys.  70 in his 70s.  Oh, the guy is so ahead of the rest of them, it's obvious. 
[00:41:30]  He is in amazing shape and he sounded great, man.  He'll be doing it at least another 10, you watch.  Mick.  These guys will die off around him and he'll just continue, somehow, someway.  Yeah.  Oh, it was obvious.  Just surround himself with other musicians and keep going, trudging on.  All right.  I'll bet you those tickets, though, man, that, uh, Benson, they're playing the Beacon Theater  as well, I'll bet you those tickets are going to go for 50, 60 bucks.  It's going to be hard to get.  At least.  Earl, anything else to add?  If they're a dime. 
[00:42:00]  Um, actually, can I, uh, can I plug a show?  Oh, oh, oh.  What are you plugging?  Earl.  What is it first?  Well, uh, Saturday, May 14th at Symphony Space.  The, uh, the Black Rock Coalition will be appearing, doing a tribute to Ray Charles.  How timely.  Black Rock Coalition.  What is the Black Rock Coalition?  Well, it, uh, you know what it is.  I honestly don't.  Well, we, we know it as a radio show you want to do where it's.  Yeah, how do they do something live?  Wait, we haven't told the new audience about Earl and his dream. 
[00:42:30]  Well, not a, well.  Earl, give your pitch to Eric Logan, because he, Earl's been trying to get Eric, uh, Logan  on the phone for a while.  And, and, and all kidding aside, Earl is, uh, you know, a hard worker and, and, and, uh,  we'd love to have him around XM.  But, uh, Eric's not really, uh, returning your calls yet, is he now?  No.  All right.  And what's your idea?  Well, it.  He listens to us every day.  Go ahead.  I said it.  It's really sort of like an alternative rock show for black people.  Uh-huh.  And, no, it's like black, uh, rock, rock and roll by black people. 
[00:43:00]  So what, what, you're not talking about the usual stuff like hip hop that you would hear.  No, not at all.  That black people, uh, play.  So what, what type of bands would, would you play on this show?  What would your, uh, top five bands be?  Uh, right now, Mars Volta.  Yeah, true.  Uh, Block Party.  A great band out of England.  Uh-huh.  Uh, maybe a guy like John Legend, who's selling a ton of records right now.  Uh.  He's got some new names.  It used to just be Living Color. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Living Color and, uh, Fishbone.  Yeah.  And this is the Bo Diddley Weekend.  All Bo Diddley.  Uh, this, this amazing, uh, spoken word guy named, uh, Saul Williams.  Now you're losing us.  Now you're losing us.  After three on the rock station, you have to go to a guy who talks.  Spoken word.  As far as new stuff.  All word is spoken.  Well, that's true.  Why does it have to be the coalition?  Why does everything have to be so militant sounding?  It doesn't, I don't think it sounds militant at all.  It does too. 
[00:44:00]  Black Rock Coalition.  Well, the original name was Collective, but they thought it's too...  Faggoty?  How about just Black Rock?  Well, you know, every, you know how everything is.  It's a branding thing.  It's gotta be a coalition.  Yeah.  Like there's a big...  What, does this, is Living Color even together anymore?  Yes, they are.  Really?  Stones like them.  Yeah, they, uh, they opened up for them back in, uh, 89.  Yeah.  I mean, well, it's more of a, it's more than musicians. 
[00:44:30]  It's, it's photographers, it's writers, it's, it's, it's, it's a coalition.  Right.  Right.  All right, well, I think you really sold it.  Yeah.  Your phone should be ringing any second from Eric Lohan.  Well, I didn't, oh, it's early, guys, I'm sorry.  It's all right, well, this is your big moment to sell the show.  No, Amy, but there's all this amazing music coming out that no one gets to hear,  because it keeps falling under the cracks of, well, it doesn't rock enough,  or it's too R&B enough, and there's all this stuff that's out there, 
[00:45:00]  and we have, we would do the show that would feature all this music.  Now, hold on, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I'm looking at Matt Lauer interviewing Mick and Rich.  Get this audio immediately.  Look at, oh, my God.  Mick and Keith Richards.  He probably got them right at, that was right at the, right after the set.  Oh, my God, look at Keith's belly.  I told you, he's skin and bones with a beer belly.  I've never seen anything like that in my life.  You've got to see him without that jacket on.  Is he still smoking, too?  Oh, yeah, big time. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Wow, he looks old.  All right, Earl, we've got to let you go.  I just want to let you know, the show's May 14th at Symphony Space on 95th and Broadway.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Earl.  Randy Krueger.  I wonder if he got a picture with the band.  The black guy, they don't even acknowledge the black guy.  He would be on the Black Rock Coalition, though, right?  What's his name do? 
[00:46:00]  Not Woods.  Let's get a taste of that.  Ron Woods.  What does Ron Wood play?  Ron Wood plays guitar.  Oh, there's two guitarists?  Keith and Woody.  Daryl Jones plays bass.  Watts plays drums.  Mick occasionally plays guitar.  Dude, why don't they just introduce him into the band, then, if he's been there for so  long?  Like, Metallica doesn't have, didn't have Kirk standing on the side, or, you know, why don't  they just bring him in a band?  Well, why don't you call Mick and ask him?  No, but, I mean, that does make sense. 
[00:46:30]  He's not, I thought he was just a studio guy who backed up on stage.  I didn't realize he was the bassist.  Well, I mean, when they go on tour, they have a whole bunch of other musicians.  You know, like yesterday, that Brown Sugar version, there's usually a saxophone involved.  That was just them.  And, you know, they have backup singers for Gimme Shelter, they usually have two black  chicks.  Do you think Joe Wyman is rich now?  He got a divorce.  Remember he married that girl that was really young?  He married some young chick, and they hate each other?  He put out a great book.  He put out a great book a few years ago, and he collected all through, he saved everything. 
[00:47:00]  I mean, it was all the stuff he had saved.  It was pretty interesting, actually.  Why doesn't he go back to the band?  He doesn't need to.  He probably wants to just enjoy his life.  All right, we'll take a break.  Is that it right there?  Yeah.  No, I want to play this.  Here's an excerpt of the new song by the Rolling Stones, a song called, Oh No, Not You Again.  Oh No, Not You Again.  Oh No, Not You Again.  I can stand in pain. 
[00:47:30]  What's better to try to stop?  That's an hour again.  The setting's so romantic.  Love is in the air.  I'm a puppet.  I'm a legend.  Three birds and stare.  There you have it.  That's all they'll give us.  Obviously, that'll be a radio hit.  Of course.  All right, we'll continue.  See you on a show. 
[00:48:00]  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The O.B. & Anthony Show.  In case you didn't nudge.  The O.B. & Anthony Show.  Stealing roses disappearing into bones.  There's a dry mouth.  Breaking into parts of sealing our intention. 
[00:48:30]  And the sitting with an oil drying pretty hot.  And the toe of Sally Sutton.  Still you feed a slice from the tablecloth.  System of a down  On this fine whip them out Wednesday  Do you have your wow stickers yet?  Do you?  If you don't, you just have to go to opianthony.com 
[00:49:00]  For the info  Basically you send in a self-addressed stamped envelope  And we send the wow stickers right out to you  Very easy  You throw the wow on your vehicle  If the ladies feel like it  They will flash you on the highway  The side streets, in your driveway, wherever you're  You might even be at the mall, in the parking lot  You never know  That's how it works  But it happens all the time  But you have to be in it to win it  I gotta tell you 
[00:49:30]  It also supports the show by having a wow on your car  Because some of the women's groups really get pissed off by it  Just before we came back to the show  God, I'm having a tough time this morning  I'm so tired for that Rolling Stones thing  They showed Steve Martin on ABC  Doing King Tut or something  What was that about?  Obviously an old clip  But I like Steve Martin  He was very funny many years ago  Many years ago  He seems to be a bit smug and elitist 
[00:50:00]  And it's like  Dude, you were fucking  You did a mummy song  You didn't  You never did a fucking real thing on stage  I mean, he was  The fact that Comedy Central  Oh  Which, everything that's actually made me sick  I was watching an old tough crowd yesterday  Get him off my TV  I still want to spit in all their faces  Forgetting that show  Very funny show  It just never said a real thing at all on stage  No  It wasn't anything that thought-provoking in any way 
[00:50:30]  That would make you laugh  He put an arrow through his head  And this song was alright  It was enjoyable  It's my favorite hunky  Anyway, the point I want to make  Shut up  They show Steve Martin on TV  And I basically said he should be shot  For trying to remake the Pink Panther movie  Yeah  There are just some comedies 
[00:51:00]  That should not be remade  Yeah, that's one of them  You know, The In-Laws was just a brilliant comedy  With Peter Falk  Yeah  And the rest of the gang there  Alan Arkin, right?  I don't remember  Alan, I think, whatever  Yeah  And then Michael Douglas thinks  He could do a better job than Peter Falk  Yeah  When they remade that movie  Awful  And it sat on the shelves for years in Hollywood  And they finally, you know, released it  And it just obviously bombed  And it's one of the worst movies ever made  In my opinion  The Black Honeymooners, why?  I'll tell you why 
[00:51:30]  Because they're unoriginal scumbags  That's what all of you are  I understand almost  When they remake certain things for visual effects  You can almost understand that  But most of them are just such crushing, to call it, crushing bores  Yeah, you want to see some movies remade  Because they could use the technology of the day  To make it look better or something  Star Wars, perfect example  Yeah, Star Wars  The look of the new Star Wars is amazing  You look at it now  You look at the original first Star Wars movie that came out  And it's so cheesy as far as the effects go 
[00:52:00]  I would like him to remake the original  He probably will  Give him a couple of years of sitting around with no Star Wars project  And he'll be like  Eh, you know, I could take the first one  Instead of adding in some CGI and stuff  Let me just scrap it  I'll make an entirely new one  Maybe the storyline's a little different  So it ties in with the newer ones that he made a little better  And there's no loose ends and things like that  It would be so dark  Yeah, sure  It wouldn't be all cute  Oh, wouldn't it be great to see Luke's aunt and uncle  Getting hacked up 
[00:52:30]  Thrown on the fire  By the stormtroopers  Yeah, they'd just show the aftermath in the original  Uncle Owen!  Yeah, that's it  Uncle Owen!  Ah!  Yeah  Show them all bloody  That'd be nice  But they're doing this in Hollywood  Why?  Why would you remake the Pink Panther?  The original Pink Panther still holds up  It's hilarious  It's hilarious  And he's going to stink  He's going to put some unfunny French accent on  Rich Little, who did actually great impressions  Could never do the Pink Panther  It's not as easy as people think 
[00:53:00]  Peter Sellers was fucking brilliant  He's going to do the wild and crazy guy accent  Because we are too wild and shut up  I am the Pink Panther  And I'm not sure how I feel about the remake of The Bad News Bears  With Billy Bob Thornton  That can't be done  That can't be done  Well, you know  It's a comedy  There's nothing that's happened in the last 25 years  That merits a remake  The previews look pretty good, you know  Really?  But, I don't know  I think it's going to be another bomb 
[00:53:30]  Are the kids just tussleable?  That Tanner Boyle  They're getting a little weird, though  With the new Bad News Bears movie  I guess they're trying to be more politically correct  Because they've got a kid in a wheelchair  What?  Yeah  They've got a kid in a wheelchair  Instead of the fat guy that was the catcher  Now they have a kid in a wheelchair  Unless they're going to goof on him somehow  Because Billy Bob Thornton does seem like he does some rough shit  Yeah  It's pretty dark  So I'll almost give that one  But there's no reason to do it  Yeah  Make another movie  Yeah, make another movie  Stop fucking stealing  God, you're all thieves in Hollywood 
[00:54:00]  That's what you do  You're fucking thieves  You take one brilliant thing or original thing  And you spoil it  You ruin it  Like a bunch of fucking bloodsuckers  You just jump on  Suck the creativity and the idea out  And redo it  Rehash it  I'm on the internet movie database over here  And somebody turned me on to this  Jim Norton  Who is listed prominently  With all of his credits 
[00:54:30]  Tough crowd  Spider-Man is on there  Colin Quinn  American Dummy  You've got his notable TV guest appearances  Tonight Show  Last Comic Standing  Ed  Do they have the gynecologist and side splitters as well, Ed?  Yes, they do  The gynecologist  Rock Bottom  You played Diesel in Rock Bottom  Yeah, I was going to  It's a film I would never plug  Because the guy  It wasn't a good movie  Right  And I would plug  I used to want to plug it as a bad movie  All right  One of your credits 
[00:55:00]  It was a first project for the guy  I saw Rock Bottom  Yeah  Errors, Freaks, and Oddities  Errors, Freaks  Oh, that was Independent I did  Yeah  You were Paul in that  Yes, White Chicks Incorporated  Which is the worst thing ever captured on film  I don't see White Chicks Incorporated on here  There's a reason for that  It's awful  Really?  It's beyond awful  That's what Voss is  I get those reaction shots of Voss  Yeah  I'm the man  That one  Brokers, 1997  Yeah, wow  Yeah, I forgot about that  That was my first role  Homeless guy  Yeah  But I'm looking at your bio 
[00:55:30]  Has your birthday  New Brunswick, New Jersey  USA  I was not born there  I was born in Bayonne  No  But then it has details of death  7th May 2005  New York, New York  Age related  Someone sent me that  I got a real good laugh  This is the website  That you pretty much get all of your movie and star info from  And you assume it's correct  When you look 
[00:56:00]  You punch up someone like Tom Cruise  You'll get his birthday where he was born  A lot of trivia on him  But then I look up Jimmy's  And it's in parentheses  Age related  It's like how do they hack into that site?  Why don't they have a picture of me?  Yeah, where's the picture, Jimmy?  You've got to send them a picture  Oh, really?  Yeah  That's funny  I should send them the one I'm in my underwear  Very good  Let's go to Mark in New York  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good morning  Good morning  How about the remake of The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler? 
[00:56:30]  Oh  That's going to be ridiculous  And Chris Rock  Yeah, I don't have any faith in that one at all  No, it looks like it's going to be a huge bomb  Punch it out  I actually saw a still photograph of Burt Reynolds in a football uniform  Oh, I know  He's putting  I saw a clip  And he's putting a football helmet on and running out onto the field  And he's, you know, with his famous number 22 and everything  Stop it  It's like, what are you doing?  And you know he thinks he can still play football  No, you can't  Fool  Who are you going to get that's better than Richard Keel? 
[00:57:00]  I think I broke his fucking neck  Yeah  Who are you going to get that's going to do that scene better?  Or the ball being thrown right in the guy's cock  Twice  They're just going to do it again  They're going to do all the old gags over again with other people  And that'll be it  Who is it?  Eddie Albert played the warden?  Oh, yeah  Oh, very good  Yeah  He was great  I'm going to have to watch that movie  I haven't seen that one in a while  Caretaker?  Because they weren't grabbing just hot comics  What the fuck are they doing, man? 
[00:57:30]  God, they spoil  You know what it is?  It's all these 25-year-old jerk-offs  Again, with the jeans  And the stupid suit jackets  And the little, did no tie underneath  And you're just awful  You're all awful  Yeah  You're spoiled television  You're spoiling films  You're good for nothing  Nothing new  Nope  Nothing  Alright, moving on  The Tony Danza thing from yesterday  Remember I said that we've got to get like a montage of everyone talking about the Tony Danza accident  Of course  You want to set this up again, Ann? 
[00:58:00]  He was racing what?  Rusty Wallace  Rusty Wallace  Yeah, and it was the, oh, the name  The Daytona 500, he called it  Get it?  See, it's the Daytona 500  Norton's disgusted face  How do you?  He turns around all angry  And they cancel tough crowd  This is what America wants to watch  How do you, as a fucking man  As an ex-boxer  How do you go, look, you know what?  That's too faggoty  We're not saying that  It's not funny  It's not cute 
[00:58:30]  It's not interesting  The Rubes love it, though  The Daytona 500  Yeah, the Daytona 500  And it was him and Rusty  Racing go-karts  Around a little track that they put out in the street  By the studio  That they tape Tony in front  And they had hay bales and tires and stuff  Kind of marking off the course  And Tony, I guess, was in the lead into this turn  And Rusty kind of did what Rusty does  When he's racing NASCAR  He's called trading a little paint  And he tapped him a little 
[00:59:00]  And what he did was perform one of those pit maneuvers  That the cops do  To try to make a car spin out  And Tony spun  Hit one of the hay bales  When he was sideways  And flew upside down  Just tipped over  Looked like he cracked his head wide open  But I don't know how that guy walks away uninjured  How did he walk away uninjured?  His arm went underneath the go-kart  It bent away  And the arm shouldn't be bending  And this mook just gets up  His big, thick skull 
[00:59:30]  He just gets up  Yeah, I'm fine  No problem  Everything's okay  Dope  He didn't want to wear a helmet  Because you know that they  They were telling him that his hair looks better  Without a helmet on  Yeah  Tony, you've got to go back in  Maybe do, I don't know  You know, your hair  We're going to have to put you back in hair and makeup  It's going to take time  And he didn't wear a helmet  And I flew over  And this thing's been getting more media attention  So I guess every news station did a little thing on it  Yeah, here's  So some of the news people are going 
[01:00:00]  Oh, thank God he's okay  Yeah  And by the way, can I say  That that rusty guy  What a jerk off  Dan, I can't  When I saw that clip  I've never rooted for a spine to be cracked in half  As bad as I did  I can't tell you  Right  Kyle got his shiver thinking that spine has to break  But when you're a NASCAR racer  And you're running around with a talk show host  What the fuck are you doing bumping him like that?  Why?  What's wrong with you?  That is true  It's just like a harmless, fun little get-together 
[01:00:30]  And this guy's so competitive  He couldn't have Tony out in front of him  That's like Shaquille and him  Doing a couple of free throws or whatever  And Shaquille giving him a real elbow to the chest  Yeah  Or a real physical thing  And then slamming it  And like, yeah  Why would you do that?  Of course it would be funny  I'm not saying I wouldn't root for it  See that black elbow crashing into those awful cat teeth  A little hockey maybe  Play a little hockey  And then get up there and just put him against the boards  And just pummel him  Throw the gloves off and stuff 
[01:01:00]  Punching him in the face  The day Tony 500  Yeah, it was obvious  Dave from Ohio is going to say this  Rusty was pissed because he was losing  Yeah  Of course  That's funnier  And he didn't want to play along with the silly gag  Like, okay, we'll let Tony win  Yeah  No, he wants to race  Motherfucker, we're going to race  I respect that  So Tony Danza threw a montage of all the clips  Of everyone talking about him and his crash  And this played yesterday  For those of you who haven't seen it 
[01:01:30]  It was sort of in the news  Watch this  Let's show you this  And here's proof  You never know what's going to happen  On the Tony Danza show  I'm going to be on the show today  I can't wait to see him  I'm going to bring a first aid kit  That's amazing  That's scary  Not to wear a helmet  Near miss  That's one of those  Don't try this at home type things  I was freaked out, man  Because I thought my last year of racing  I killed Tony Danza  You know what I do  And number one on the hood  Gee, the Tony Danza show  Monday  Rusty Wallace and Tony Danza  In a go-kart race 
[01:02:00]  And Wallace Rubin's racing  Tony  They roll him over on the boy's head  Look at this  Look at Tony  Who's the boss?  Rusty Wallace is the boss  Tony  He's okay  And thank God  America needs him  There you have it  America needs him  He's a superhero  These stupid newscasters  Here's something you shouldn't try at home  Really?  Make sure you wear a helmet, kids 
[01:02:30]  Really?  They're just  You know what it is?  Because  The lack of  They're so dishonest  In what they're doing  It's so forced  They don't talk  With their real voices  It's just  They're fucking  They're awful  They really are  They're like radio  Most radio guys  They're terrible  Who talks like that?  There's a whole thing  Going on in this country  That we just don't get  I just don't get it  What?  You know  The people that enjoy  Like the Tony Danza show 
[01:03:00]  Oh yeah  That whole thing  You know  I just don't get it  I cannot understand  Everyone isn't watching it  To goof on it  You know  Of course  None of them are  Like we turn it on  And go  That's what I mean  People are sitting there  Really enjoying the hell out of it  They're enjoying it as entertainment  To Sid  And they enjoy the guests  They enjoy his banter  They enjoy the opening monologue  And Plinko  And all the fun things  From the show  I don't get it  I don't  Those are the people  You can never convince 
[01:03:30]  Or even sway  In an argument  About anything  Like any of your ideology  You can never  Even get them  To consider it  Because they're just  We're so different  As people  What makes us laugh  What's important to us  Things like that  Completely different  Right  They just want something easy  While they're cleaning the house  And looking after the rugrats  Yeah  Something they can peek over  The high chair at  And enjoy  There you go  I see it as people  Who have given up 
[01:04:00]  Just given up  There's so many people  That gave up  And just accept  Whatever's given to them  As you know  What's supposed to be  Entertainment  Is their entertainment  No surprises  No spontaneity  Everything's planned out  Like you want  You want some kind of  Surprise in your entertainment  But not people like that  Just keep it bland  Keep it milk toast  And I'm happy  Got my family  My kids  My life is over  This is now  What I have to do 
[01:04:30]  With my life  And no surprises  Like I like Ellen  I really do  I think her dancing thing  Just it's unfunny  It's uninteresting  It's beneath her  She's a comic  She's a good comic  She's always been funny  Yeah  You don't need to  Fucking do that  It's becoming  It's becoming like  Like Peter Finch  Where you do the one thing  And then they want to  Rope you in  And make you do it  Every night  That's what she's doing  She's dancing  And you know  It stinks  It's the old  Worn out catch phrase  It's you know  The prat fall 
[01:05:00]  That happens all the time  It just  It becomes mundane  The one minute  Clock  And I hate  The thing I hate  More of the dance  Is the little clock  They draw  That has like  Dancing legs  It's a dancing clock  Jimmy  You can't enjoy  The dancing clock  No  You know  Just the sound of that  Really makes her  Shiver and cringe  Yeah you know  She can't possibly  Be into that  Well just because  It's clock  Oh well true 
[01:05:30]  What do you want to put  No it's a clock  It's too close  Let's go to Joey  Joey what's up  Hey boys  Hey  Hey I heard another quote  From Eric Logan  Oh okay  Yeah he was saying  If they remake Star Wars  They'll probably get  A lot of geeky  Tech types coming out  No  But I  I know  I know what you're  Trying to do dude  And you can't make  Things up about Logan  You just gotta tell  The truth  Like  He made a good point 
[01:06:00]  About that hit station  Yesterday  And we talked about  The Stones thing  And he said  I bet you  When tickets go on sale  People are gonna  Sap him up  Alright  Ben in Maine  What's up  What's up guys  Hey  For that Tony Danza thing  I was waiting  For that Joe Theismann moment  Where just like  His spine would burst  Out of his back  On live television  You know that Joe Theismann  Where you kind of  Look away  But you have to look  We've all seen that  That is one of the  You see the pressure  Go on that leg  It takes a second  And then  Just splat 
[01:06:30]  And you see Rusty Wallace  Just kind of looking over  And then he just dries off  And watching the leg bend  Between the ankle  And the knee  Sideways  No  No  Even worse  Even worse  The knee bending backwards  Sometimes you see that  But yeah  Go ahead  Ben  The eye man  Yeah  Just busting your balls  And your brother's balls  Oh really  He said  He said he emailed  He's going  You know he has his hat  Pulled down  And he's chewing that gum  And he's leaned up 
[01:07:00]  Over the microphone  And he said  Where's my  Opio and Anthony  T-shirt  He said he emailed  Your brother  Did he really  He said Bernie  Did it like  Three weeks ago  And he got his T-shirt  He said he'll wear it  He's probably in prison  His brother's probably  In prison  In prison  That's all I know  And he gets  You could tell  They had to go to break  But you know  When he starts getting  Worked up  And everyone's  A scum sucking weasel  He was ready  So you may want  To get the eye man  Because he was saying 
[01:07:30]  How much he loves you  When he loves you guys  But he wants his  He wants his T-shirt  I want my god damn  I want my god damn  T-shirt  Have a great one guys  Alright thank you  That's funny  Yeah we have this weird  Thing going on with  I actually really  Enjoyed his show  When we were off  For two years  I watched him  Every morning  While I was drinking  Coffee and reading  The newspapers  That is brilliant  Pulling themselves up  That is brilliant  What happens if they're  Right though  They don't have a  Mass suicide  On this show  Forget about Sid  Poor Sid 
[01:08:00]  What a mess he is  But no reward  I think it's  Fairly clear  Sid you're a waste  Let's go to  John in Jersey  John  Sid actually  Hold on John  Yeah quickly  Sid went into rehab  Because he had a problem  He was in a hotel room  He was on drugs  He was thinking  Seriously considering  Jumping out the window  And he goes on  I miss his show  And he starts  Spilling his guts  About this whole thing  Saying how he really  Wanted to kill himself  And all he could do  Is think about his kid 
[01:08:30]  He had a picture  Of his daughter  Or something  Picture of his daughter  And he started crying  And he's crying  On I miss his show  And saying that  That's what pulled him  Back and got him  Into rehab  And I miss  Just in his  Inimitable style  Just goes  You know Sid  It would have been  A more interesting  Story if you  Had jumped  What a scumbag  That's why we love him  I love him  But the beauty is  When you got a guy  Like Sid  On your show  A mess  You gotta go with it  You have to  What are you gonna do 
[01:09:00]  Let's give our thoughts  And prayers to a Sid  No  Sports guys  Are never interesting  I'm sorry guys  But very rarely  Are sportscasters interesting  How do you not go  With that guy  He's phenomenal  You have to  And Bernie's hilarious  You just gotta goof on him  The stories  I used to hear  About Sid  In the bars in Brooklyn  Holy shit  I used to go  To this one bar  And the bartender  Is just telling me  How Sid  Would come in  When his wife  Was away  And just ask 
[01:09:30]  For money  To gamble with  Because he had  A big gambling problem  So this guy  Was like  I wound up  Giving Sid  Like 20 G's  Like $20,000  And he goes  Of course  I'd never see it  And then he doesn't  Come in anymore  And he goes  And I'm one of the nice guys  He goes  There are people  That just want to  Kill this son of a bitch  Because he owes them money  Right  Sid  A complete mess  Is that Imus' new studio  Or is that a special  That's you  It's in a fucking newsroom  That's gotta be awful  They moved him 
[01:10:00]  To the MSNBC  Facility  But he's in an open studio  Yep  Well he's messing  They're messing up his show  Because he's in  The MSNBC complex  Whatever  And then his other guys  Are back in Astoria  Or wherever they broadcast  Who?  So he has to look at them  Which other guys?  Sid  Sid is not in the same studio  As him  Oh right  Right  Right  He has to look at them  Through a monitor  That is the worst way  To do radio  Why are they doing that?  But his regular guys  Are with him  Yeah  Him and Bernie  Are the only ones 
[01:10:30]  And then the rest of the gang  Are back  Like that's back  At the other studio  Are you kidding?  That's terrible  What a horrible way  To do a radio show  Hey John  What's up?  Hey guys  How you doing guys?  Good  I screwed up already  Oh yeah  They were talking with Sid  And Sid said  He actually called you guys  And they were making fun of Sid  That  Iman said  If ONA don't call you back  Then you know  You got nothing going on  In your life  He's been calling everybody  Yeah  The other caller said  That he emailed your brother 
[01:11:00]  And was hoping for his ONA feature  Oh that's hilarious  Cool  Alright John  Thanks  Hey guys  Watch out  Yeah man  I just gave me a lot of advice  During our time off  He was really concerned about us  He was calling all the time  To the point I started  Blowing off his calls  You got to wear more denim  And a cowboy hat  That's his advice  He wanted us  Getting back on the air  He wanted us to do what he did  And go to like a small market  Yeah yeah  And be big again  That was it  And then come back to New York  I'm like  We are so done with that  I'm like  And I just don't have it in us 
[01:11:30]  To just do that again  Did he do that?  Huh?  What happened?  He went to Cleveland  Or something?  Yep  When?  I forget exactly how the story goes  He had some problems in New York  He got fired  And he  Because his drugs  And booze in  And  They fired him from  The station he was working in  In New York  I think it was NBC  Wasn't it?  I don't know  I don't remember the call letters  It might have been another station  It might have been before NBC  Yeah  I think there was another station  Really long ago  Like in the 70s or something  So they  You know  He got another job in Cleveland 
[01:12:00]  And built his reputation back up I guess  Until he got an offer to come back to New York  Right  He was like  Yeah that's what I did  Why don't you guys  You know  Find a market and go there  No  And it was funny  He was telling me  Because this is an old radio thing  He's like  Then I started getting the calls from  You know  New York radio  And they're like  We want to hear a show  You know  So he would give like  A greatest hits tape  Yeah  And make believe  I used to do that too  And make believe it's one show  It's one day  Yeah  Phenomenal  Every second is great 
[01:12:30]  And that's how he got back in New York  He said  He got together  A greatest hits tape  So it was NBC  Then went to Cleveland  And then back to NBC  He used to be  I'm just in the morning program  That's where I got that from  Program  It's something he's saying  W-A-N-B-C  He's a funny dude man  He always  Always made me laugh  I would never listen to Howard in the morning  I would always listen to Imus  Because my father listened to him  And he made me laugh  He's a funny bastard man  Yeah at work I had the AM radio  And listened to Imus 
[01:13:00]  When it was on AM  W-A-N-B-C  Hideous  I love when he says hideous  It's just such a natural piece of disdain  Coming out  He's so miserable  It's just  It's not forced  But it's such a natural speech way  Alright let's go to Donald  Donald  Yes sir  What do you got Donald  I got the  IMS audio from just a few moments ago  Oh okay  Talking about us  Good  It'll be about a 10 second walk up to the actual part  Where he starts talking about you guys  Thanks  Baby doll  Alright let's go  This is 
[01:13:30]  Where's my Opie and Anthony t-shirt by the way  Looking for it  Trying to get it for you  Looking on it  Here's the problem  It's all Opie's brother  You know  And we know what's going on there  Opie's brother designed these t-shirts  Yeah  And so you have to email Opie's brother  He's probably in prison  You can get a dime bag with your shirt  Exactly  Like you know some code word in there  But I have a feeling that they haven't even made the t-shirts yet 
[01:14:00]  So Rob orders the t-shirts  And then you're supposed to be able to  Oh there's a picture of me and Opie at some  It doesn't look like  Oh that's like a  Oh my gosh  Father of God  It's like a pride parade  It is  Holy smoke  What  That is very very  Homosexual  Inspiring  What are you talking about  Well look at you  Look at you  And Opie  And  Oh my gosh  I look pretty good  When it's a man with Opie  I love Opie 
[01:14:30]  The fact that he's standing next to an old queen  That's what he loves  I look like he's on the steps of the courthouse  Oh my God  What is it  What is it  What is it  What is it  What is it  What is it  What is it  Good Lord  That's disturbing  It is  Ouch  I love Opie  Anyway I want my Opie and Anthony t-shirt  I want it  I mean I'm tired of this  Sid why didn't you get it for me  I'm trying  I mean  Did you call him  I called him 
[01:15:00]  And no one  No one called me back as of yet  So I don't think  Even Opie and Anthony  Don't want to appreciate this kid anymore  That's unbelievable  Hey Lusa  When Opie and Anthony  I won't talk to you  You're really  You are  I'm a jerk  Very funny  So there you go guys  Donald in Detroit  You're a star today  Thank you buddy  I've been with you since day one  Since about 6-08  When you finally got it on the air  That first morning  Oh cool  Thanks Donald

[01:22:30]  Of course I like checking out all the new girls that are listed on there  And it's a lot of fun to check out the ones that get the least amount of votes  Because boy is that entertaining  That's what I was going to say  I mean I enjoy regular girls showing their boobs much more than like really really just over the top hot  Stripper  Stripper girls with fake boobs and all that  And I've noticed that we're not getting a lot of new ones at RateMyWow.com  So ladies from all over the country if you feel like showing us a little something something 
[01:23:00]  Go to RateMyWow.com and figure it out  Okay  There you go  Pat from Minaki is on the line Anthony  And we got his email in front of us here  Hello Pat  And he wants to help out the show  We love people that want to help out the show and market the show for us  Of course  Except I'm doing a better job marketing the show  But I think we could do a lot more  And Pat from Minaki has an idea  Pat what's going on buddy?  Hey guys what's up?  Hey guys  Hey how you doing guys?  It's Pat 
[01:23:30]  I love the Pat  Yeah we love Pat  I hear you got my email  Yeah  Yeah  Hmm  Okay  The top of his email  Yeah  In the subject  Because I guess it's his plan  He's got a plan for advertising the show  And helping himself out and things like that  And it says subject  Plan 9 toes from Minaki 
[01:24:00]  Because he's got 9 toes  In parentheses there  Because he lost a toe to the diabetes  Get it Pat?  Well let me read your email here Pat  Okay  It says my van is on its last legs  10 years old with 356,000 miles on it  Like me  I'll be getting a new one in the near future  Sooner if need be  It's got three wheels  I lost a wheel to diabetes 
[01:24:30]  Hey Pat  You've had this van for 10 years?  It's a 95 Ford  With almost 360,000 miles on it  And you own a  Do you own the business?  Yeah  It's called Philbin Transport  Philbin Transport  And he delivers things  Yeah  What's a day like for you in your van?  What do you deliver?  Anything from envelopes  To like a van load of boxes  Printed materials  Now why would someone call 
[01:25:00]  Philbin  Instead of  Let's say FedEx or something  Well actually  I work for a courier  Who gets like lots of work  And they give it to me  Oh  So you're like the overflow guy  Yeah  Well yeah  Like eggnog  Oh I see  He overflowed at the eggnog  Oh  Oh I missed that sound  So you're doing okay in your business?  Oh yeah  I turn down work 
[01:25:30]  Because a lot of people want to use me  Wow  Look at that  Yeah  Alright  Well let me continue with your letter  My question is  Do you think XM  Would consider advertising  The Opie and Anthony show  XM Wow  Designed by either  You know  Cage or Opie's brother  Or maybe a contest  On the new van  Only with your okay  Of course  Then he goes on to  I guess you've checked into  The cost of a professionally applied graphic  Yeah  Just a general  Inquiry 
[01:26:00]  Right  On that website link I gave  Now we're talking about  We've seen  Everybody has seen the van  The radio station vans  That drive around your town  And the graphic  Is applied to the entire van  And it's got  You know  Maybe a personality  From the show  The call letters  Some type of music  That they play  Maybe on the side  So you're talking about  Something that would cover  The entire van  Yeah something that looks professional  Something that wouldn't embarrass Opie  Right  It's got to be  Something professional  Not just you know 
[01:26:30]  Like your van now  With some Wow stickers on it  Yeah  Right  So he  I drive around  My windows down  I'm cranking the tunes  I'm cranking the show  I get looks  Like hey  Get a load of fatso over there  Yeah he is  He is a super fan  He's got stickers  All over his van  I guess we would do this  We just don't want any connection  To this  Just in case like  He has some kind of  Dark secret  Or other life  Well  That's going to come to light  My trailer  I'm certain XM 
[01:27:00]  Will look into  The legal department  Will look into  The repercussions  If Pat  Runs over  A family of five  With this whole  XM  Opie and Anthony  Logo on there  If we would be liable  For anything  You know  Obviously  They should have been  In the road  Get out of the street  But basically  Pat says  Here that he  Comes in and out  Of the city  All day  In rush hour  Traffic  You travel about  750 miles a day  Pat  Well no  That's like  The most I've ever done 
[01:27:30]  When the planes  Were down at 9-11  I went to  Like Filer City  Michigan  Like 15 hours there  I took like  A five minute nap  And then 15 hours back  So the average  Is about 150  To 200 miles a day  Okay  And a lot of visibility  Here in our fair city  And surrounding areas  And it would be  It would make sense  To have a van  Driving around  Like a mobile billboard  Advertising the program  I could show up  Like at concerts  Or whatever  Yeah  He could be one  Of the go-to guys  It's not a bad idea 
[01:28:00]  It's not a bad idea  But again  We would have to be  We couldn't be  Held responsible  In any way  Shape or form  For any of Pat's  Actions  While in this van  You know what I mean  So maybe it's just  I don't know  Some kind of graphic  That says  I'm a fan  Of Opie and Anthony  On XM Satellite Radio  Or the unofficial  Wow banner  The unofficial  Yeah that old gag  Or just some way  I'll cover things  When I run that family  At five over  Right  Just some way 
[01:28:30]  Where we wouldn't be  Well I guess  We're going to pass your idea  On to the marketing department  So we should hear something  By hopefully 2006  Pat  We  We like the idea  We like the idea  You have our approval  But now we have to go  Through XM Corporate  Oh  Uh oh  Which is  I feel like Big Kev  Right now  Yeah good luck to you  On that one  But yeah  It's free advertising 
[01:29:00]  For the show  I say we figure  Something out for Pat  How are things going  In the love life there Pat  Let me think  About the same  Nothing  Yeah nothing  Yeah you never  You never got  Back in touch  With that girl  From the Hard Rock  Uh no  I think she got  Hoof and mouth disease  And died  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Girl made out with Pat  At the Hard Rock  To win a MiFi  And sucked his toes  His nine remaining toes 
[01:29:30]  At the space  Where the toe was  Right  Yeah that was  Quite a treat  For all of us  Jesus  All right Pat  Uh we like it  We'll uh  Definitely get back to you  All right  Very good  Now I  The photoshoppers  On uh  Whackback  Get to work  And uh  Make what the  Design  What the van  Would look like  Yeah they also  Made me into  Tor Johnson  From plan nine 
[01:30:00]  I bet that's a pretty  Good fit  That's a funny  Photoshop  Didn't even need  Photoshop  Nick's a little  Smaller than mine  Yeah all right  All right  All right Pat  Well good luck to you  Oh thank you  There he goes  Are you working on  Another CD by the way  Of your appearances  On our show  Well actually uh  My MiFi got stolen  Uh last week  Your MiFi got stolen  Yes and I  And I'd record uh  All my mentions  Like after the Jimmy uh  Taping for HBO  And you mentioned me 
[01:30:30]  And stuff  I recorded all that  Stuff and it was all  On the MiFi  And I was going to  Transfer it to my  Computer  And it got stolen  In front of  Spark Steakhouse  That's not the worst  Thing that happened  There  How did it uh  Where was it  Uh I  Well I pulled over  On uh  I believe that's  46th Street  Right there  And I was going to  Do a delivery  To 733  3rd Ave  And I was looking  For the delivery  Entrance  So I got out  And I just  Like walked around  The corner for  And the van was 
[01:31:00]  Out of my sight  For like  20 seconds  Yeah  And these  People just  Took it  Grabbed it  Well I had my  Windows on  Because my AC  Isn't working  Oh jeez  You left your  Windows open  And the MiFi  Was where  On the dash  Uh yeah  Oh brilliant  What a brilliant  Direct connect  Thing so  And now it  Sounds like  A thousand times  Better  Jesus  So see  Well at least  At least one of  The brothers  Is listening to  Our show  Yeah really  You have to  Listen to a bunch  Of Pat from 
[01:31:30]  Munaki references  On the stupid  MiFi  Yeah  It's going to be  The latest rap  Phenomenon  It's a  Some melody  Alright Pat  Thank you  Alrighty  Bye bye  We're going to  Let you be  Let him be  There he goes  Pat  Alright Anthony  American Isle  We got the clips  In front of us  Here so  There was a  Meltdown  Von Zell  Had a little  Emotional breakdown  Okay but first  We got this  Dumb Seacrest  Joke  That he did  Last night  Oh  Well good evening 
[01:32:00]  Welcome to the show  My name is  Ryan Seacrest  How was your week?  Well  Let's just  Put it out there  Lots of shock  And outrage  Surrounding the show  And I just  Want to say  That's what  Happens  When you lose  A guy like  Scott Sable  Yeah  What does that 
[01:32:30]  Mean?  I don't watch  This show  He was  That's when I  Thought maybe  I should take  A peek at this  That clip  Reminds me  No you shouldn't  He was  Alluding to  The whole  Paul Abdul  Paul Abdul  Scandal  Obviously he was  Very uncomfortable  In his own skin  To make any  Reference to it  And joke about it  You could hear  Jimmy  Would you like to  Or should I?  What would I do?  Oh nothing  Do you think  That it was just  That Ryan  Had to address it? 
[01:33:00]  I'm still confused  Yeah  What happened?  What did I do?  Nothing  Do you think  What did I do?  Help me out  Let me in on this  And then just kill me  What did I say wrong?  You didn't say anything wrong  Actually nothing  At all  My thing is  I'm reading this  Hustler thing  And I actually did not  Hear the exact quote  But I know he said something  Oh I said address it  No no no  I didn't hear the quote  What did I say?  You didn't say anything  What Ryan Seacrest said  I didn't hear  Ryan Seacrest  Did I say his name right?  He was alluding to the  Whole Paula Abdul thing  I heard him say 
[01:33:30]  I'm Ryan Seacrest  I just kind of  Tuned out  You would think  That'll make you tune out  You would think it was  Talking about the  The Paul Abdul thing  Right  And he's  Everyone's trying to get  Is prepared for him  To talk about it  And he starts talking about  Who was kicked off last week  Right  Yeah  But how did I say it?  What you said  Was not even a problem  What did I do?  Nothing  It's not like you put  Another black mark  On the English language  Absolutely not  That's what I'm saying  Help me out  No  No no no no  Everyone else is laughing 
[01:34:00]  Out there  And I don't even know  What I said  I'm getting that feeling  Sorry  No no no no  What did I do?  Please?  Nothing  Nothing  You almost messed it up  But you just inked it out  Yeah  But why did you say  That  Just don't want to  Put a  You know  Dark blotch  On the show today  Absolutely  Saying something 
[01:34:30]  You got where you had to go  Dude  It was just  You walked a straight line  Right from one  Right  Right  Oh my god  I hate not being involved  I don't even know  What's going on  Could you write it down?  Dude I'm sweating  Help me out here  Oh well  That could be it  Oh Jesus  Dude  Oh  I am losing my mind  Oh my god  Oh it's the black marker 
[01:35:00]  Is that what you guys  Dude  It's covering your face  What is wrong with this thing?  Dude you have ink  All over your face  It was  He's like  And he goes  Should I  And I look up  And you got  It looks like a black  Feared drop  You didn't say anything wrong  No  Oh so  What I said was fine  Yeah yeah  Oh cause that's when  I get all paranoid  No no  Just show him  No show him  It's  You got one down here  There's a big blotch here  There's one over here 
[01:35:30]  Dude you gotta get a shot  It's hilarious  It's all over your face  It's just from the marker  Holy shit  Another black mark on society  Oh alright  That's great  Well let me see a mirror  Or something  This pen's been leaking  The whole morning  Get the fuck out of here  Steve comes in with a video camera  He's got like an Alice Cooper thing going with one eye  Oop could you slow down  Just so I can get a picture 
[01:36:00]  Oop just slow down  I just want a quick picture  Oop  He's hiding  They're running out to the bathroom  I was actually trying to get through the American Idol thing  And it was so distracting  I turn around to look at him  And he's looking at me  And I couldn't talk  Just looking at that big ink stained  For some reason  For some reason  When you said should I  I was like don't say anything  Yeah that's what I was thinking  Maybe some more will show up  He would smear  And he did  He smeared it all over his face  He got one 
[01:36:30]  It was one really  Dark line  A blotch  And then a streak mark  Down from the blotch  On one cheek  But then he started rubbing his face  And then rubbed in between his eyes  So he had like  It was Ash Wednesday  On his forehead  And then he rubbed under his other eye  And it looked like he had a black eye  What does he do  Just tap his face with a pen the whole time  It was probably leaky  It's one of those really  He's constantly fidgeting with everything over there  So he'll take a pen  And you'll hear  You'll hear through the shell like this  Like just this 
[01:37:00]  Right right right  Dun da dun da  And as he's doing that  The ink is flying out of the pen  Sometimes it gets on the console  In front of him  Puts his hands down  And then starts rubbing his face  And he's got like  Ink all over  He's like a four year old  With pudding  Yeah  It's all over  His little tray  And it's all over his mouth  Rubbing his hands in it  And you're like  A four year old  With pudding  Dude 
[01:37:30]  That is so fucking embarrassing  Isn't it funny  When you finally look in the mirror  And see what you had on your face  What were you guys going to tell me  I think during the break  You'd notice it  It was hilarious  Holy crap  I'm getting all freaked out  Thinking I messed up the English language again  No that was good  That was really funny  I looked like I was auditioning for  The Crow or something  The Crow  I was trying to get through the break  And you're looking right at me  And I'm like  I can't concentrate on anything I'm saying  I'm trying to remember what I said 
[01:38:00]  What word did I mispronounce  How bad am I going to get slammed this time  Oh  I was actually true  I did miss the Ryan Seacrest quote  I heard him say Ryan Seacrest  I was looking at this Hustle article  Yeah  When you hear Ryan Seacrest  You know you can safely tune out  Yeah  It's not going to be  Oh my god  Interesting or an important thing  In any way  Yeah so  That was his joke  What was the joke  I actually did  Do you want to hear it  He made it sound like  He was going to address  The Paul Abdul thing  So is this the first American Idol  Since the Paul Abdul scandal 
[01:38:30]  And she's back on the dope  Back on the dope  They pulled her off the drugs  Long enough when they thought  ABC was going to do an expose  On her drug use  Because that's what they thought  They were going to do  Okay  So Paul Abdul's lawyer  Actually called up ABC  And said look  If you mention  If you talk anything about  Drug use  We're going to come back at you  And ABC said  We're not even  Going in that direction  They called up  Very defensive 
[01:39:00]  About the drug thing  And it was about her  You know sleeping  With one of the contestants  So I guess during that time  They had taken her off the drugs  She was on the show  You could tell  She was sober  She was shaking  She was nervous to be there  Last night  Right back on the drugs  Eyes at half mass  Stumbling  Slurring her words  And generally incoherent  Why are they allowing this to happen?  I don't know  They have a formula that works  And they got too much money  Invested in the show probably  What kind of drugs 
[01:39:30]  Do you think she's on?  I think she's on something like  One of those pills  Like a valium or something  Or oxycontin  Yeah something like that  Probably the oxycontin  They love it out there  Yeah  Alright  Because she's just all  Extremely relaxed  And she tries to talk  And does things like this  To their mouth  Yeah  Really awful  Here's another  You know  Program that's just not honest  Jimmy  So this is the first live show since  And obviously they gotta say  Something about Paul Abdul  Because all of America 
[01:40:00]  Has been talking about it  So Ryan Seacrest  Starts his show with this  Listen to the  Uncomfortableness  Oh I know  In his skin  Scott's the guy  That got kicked off last week  Alright  Well good evening  Welcome to the show  My name is Ryan Seacrest  How was your week?  Well  Camera goes right on  Let's just put it out there  Lots of shock and outrage  Surrounding the show  And I just want to say 
[01:40:30]  That's what happens  When you lose a guy  Like Scott Sable  Woo  And then it was just this  Paula Abdul  Ass kiss fest  Where uh  You know  She's looking at the crowd  And they're holding up  We love you Paula  Signs  And Eric was there  You know  We love you Paula  Eric  Hawk  Eric  Remember he's  I like you  Paula Abdul  Man  You know ABC 
[01:41:00]  Handed those signs out  Of course they did  Okay you know  That happens right  I didn't know  If you meant  Eric  Or maybe  Something obvious  Was stated  Maybe Logan  Like an Eric Logan  Type joke  Yeah  Mr. Squidlow  Is calling  Opie  Old Rorschach  Oh that is the worst  Feeling  I had no idea  What  I knew you guys  Were  Whatever  It was fine  Alright  So then  Von Zell's crying 
[01:41:30]  See I don't know  This show  Well there's  Four contestants left  And  Von Zell's one of them  Obviously  And they sing  Two songs apiece  In the shows now  The first one  Was like a country song  They each had to pick  A country song  Which is just horrible  And then the second song  They had to pick  Was  From the Philadelphia  Sound  From these two writers  Don't even ask me  I have no clue  What their names are  Two black guys  From Philly  Back in the 60's  Wrote a bunch of songs  And it was for them 
[01:42:00]  To perform one of these songs  And Von Zell  Doing the country song  Was pretty weak  She didn't sound good  She was really off key  Very nervous  And then they stand  In front of the judges  And the judges  Tell them about their performance  The judges have nothing  To do with scoring them  It goes to the American public  Who votes by phone  But a lot of people said  The judges do influence  The American public  With their reactions  And they weren't too happy  And she just started  Busting out crying  She was an emotional wreck 
[01:42:30]  For some reason  Something's going on  In her life  But they didn't  Get into it of course  Because that would be  Much too interesting  So it's Von Zell  Losing her mind  I guess  How are you feeling tonight?  Um, you know  I just had a really rough day today  It's okay, sweetheart  It's okay, honey  But, you know  You just gotta pull through it  And I get a little choked up  When I see my dad over there  So  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Get us the money, baby  You're a beautiful performer  You're a beautiful performer 
[01:43:00]  You're heartfelt  You know, you're heartfelt  You wear your heart  On your sleep  You are a beautiful performer  And you've come all this way  And your grace  And your dignity  Shows every night  That you're on this stage  Thank you very much  Listen to that  Drug ramble  That drug babble  You wear your heart  On your sleep  And you're a beautiful person  Ugh  Grace and dignity  While a contestant's head  Is wrapped in her hair  Blah, blah, blah, blah  I think you should wear that outfit  Shut up  Blah, blah, blah 
[01:43:30]  Blah, blah, blah  Dumb whore  She's fucking a judge  And her advice  He's thrown off in three weeks  Yeah  What a dope  Uh  Well  I watched, of course  And um  You're still in there, huh?  Yeah  Man  I like the whole talent  End of the whole thing  Um  She  She kind of made a comeback  With the second song  Sounded pretty good  Uh  The bow guy  The rock dude  He did a pretty good job  That Anthony  Fedorov guy  Has got to go  He is horrid  He should have been gone  Weeks ago 
[01:44:00]  Hey, which one is  The blonde chick  The blonde chick  Is Carrie  Her name is Carrie  The country chick  The farm chick  Yeah, she's country  So her first song  Was the country song  She did a really good job  She looks the part  She's got the blonde hair  She's got the all-American looks  Um  But there might  There's nothing really  That special spark  Or anything with her  So  I don't know  But I think the public  Loves stuff like that  She's a good singer  She's a good singer  Got a good voice  Well, we got a taste of Anthony  Fedorov's the next one to go  Well, here he is  This is a little taste  Of his performance 
[01:44:30]  Last night for you, Anthony  Just this bland, like, blah, blah, blah  His voice isn't that bad  He was kind of off-key a few times  But, you know, can be super critical  But he's just boring  He's a boring nothing 
[01:45:00]  Look at John Tesh  Yeah  Just a douche with a mic  Awful  All right, well  There's your  You're not into it  I understand  There's your American Idol talk  There it is  And they didn't address  What happened with Paul Abdul once  Of course not  That's the point I want to make  Yeah  Of course not  Even if she just  Smashed the other network  One good quick shot  Yeah  Not one ounce of honesty  I don't understand why  It would hurt  If she did something like that  Attacked back a little bit  It's not what the show's about, Opie 
[01:45:30]  It's not what the American public wants to see  All it does is say she's guilty to me  That's all it does  Yeah  She is  She is guilty  Hey, moving on  We started the show today  Talking about the Rolling Stones press conference  By the way, Sandy Kane's here  We'll get her in in a little while  And Bob Kelly's on his way, I guess  To look at Twato?  Yes  Yeah, he's got to look  Okay  We started the show  Talking about the Rolling Stones press conference yesterday  And we saw Matt Lauer there  And then we saw Matt Lauer's interview on TV  So we want to just listen in 
[01:46:00]  And see what he did with the Rolling Stones yesterday  See if there's anything there  Because we thought it was kind of  He just looked out of place  Everyone else  Kind of was  I don't know  Everyone was looking the part  And he's there in his suit jacket  And jeans  And tapping his foot  Well, all these news guys think  For some reason  Because the Rolling Stones are old  And they've been around for a long time  That that's the one act  That when they comment on  They can be the expert  Like any other rock band  They can't really talk about it  Because their whole persona on the news  Is very stiff and stuffy  And we know  But for some reason 
[01:46:30]  They can let their hair down  With the Rolling Stones  Oh, I grew up with them  And it reminds them of, you know  When they were younger  And they all of a sudden  Start talking like they can relate  To the whole rock scene  It's just awkward  Inevitably  When you guys announce a tour  A couple of questions  Come off right off the bat  And one is why  And I read something you said  In an interview  That I thought was fascinating  You said  Why don't people ask that  Of a John Lee Hooker  Or someone like a B.B. King 
[01:47:00]  Or someone like that  That you almost think  There's an inverse racism here  That when the older white guys  Go out on tour  People say  Why are they going out on tour?  What?  What?  Are you insane?  They've got to try  To put some angle  On everything  An inverse racism  Thing going on  First of all  Racism is racism  There's no such thing  As reverse discrimination  Or inverse racism  You ass  If it's racist in nature  It's racism  Regardless of the race 
[01:47:30]  That's perpetuating it  The reason they ask  Why another tour  Is because they're  A much bigger  Commercial success  Than guys like  John Lee Hooker  And stuff like that  Those guys  You can look at them  And go  Wow, they really do it  For the music  These guys have been  Doing it forever  Yeah, sure  They made a few bucks  Doing it  But the Stones  It's a commercial thing  Much more than  You don't think  B.B. King  Is going out there  For money?  At this point  In his career  I think B.B. King  Is only going out there  For money  You think?  You see him 
[01:48:00]  Doing the commercials  What he's doing  Burger joint commercials  You can't defend that  You're right  Matt Lauer  Sitting there  Making it sound like  B.B. King  Or whatever his point was  The whole thing  That B.B. King  They don't ask  B.B. King  If he does it  For the money  Of course he's  Doing it for the money  Stop it  Maybe Mick  I don't know  What Mick's answer is  But to me  It sounds like  Mick was implying  Why are these guys  Maybe because  They're blues artists  Or whatever  Just seen as  Doing it for the art  But as a rock band  Or whatever  You understand what I mean 
[01:48:30]  Plus B.B. King  Doesn't have press conferences  Like this  Him and John Lee Hooker  Are not  I mean B.B. King  Is a legend  But if he called  A press conference like that  You think you'd get  That turnout  It's the Rolling Stone  And everyone knows  They're billionaires  They're probably  The wealthiest group  I mean maybe you too  But that's what they ask  They have the most  Profitable tours of all time  They're nameless  They sell out fucking stadiums  B.B. King can't sell out a stadium  No  He's a very famous guy  And a great artist  But he can't sell out a fucking  A baseball stadium  Multi-day shows at stadiums 
[01:49:00]  That are being sold out  Yeah  It's a stress just to bring  The racism in like that  I know  What are you doing  It's like Eric Logan says  You put these guys in a place  And you're going to sell  A few tickets  Why hasn't he called  To defend his quote  In Rolling Stone yet  Where's Eric Logan  Where's Elo  Or someone like that  That you almost think  There's an inverse  Racism here  In a way  That when the older 
[01:49:30]  White guys go out on tour  People say  Why are they going out on tour  And the jazz and blues guys  Go out on tour  No matter what age they are  You croak on stage  You know what I mean  So we're no really different  We're just musicians  I mean  It's other people's bags  That we get put in  And I mean  Right  Because we're white  You've made a lot of money  Why the hell  Would you want to do that  Because we love it  It's as simple as that  We are musicians  And we play  That's what we do  Okay  But  So we're the same 
[01:50:00]  As any other musician  That's what you do  That's your job  So that you want to do  Your job  That you enjoy doing  But  The other thing is  That the difference  Perhaps between us  And these other people  Is that we  Make a big lot of noise  About it  There you go  He is saying that  Quick press conference thing  Alright  I mean  It's a dumb question  If you want to ask why  But the inverse  Racism match  Stop trying to be interesting  It's a dumb question  That was a really bad question  When you talk about  The dynamic that exists  Between you two  And I watch you two  Sitting side by side 
[01:50:30]  I think Keith  You said something  It's not a quote  But to the effect of  You guys like to  Antagonise each other  Sometimes  But not too much  To get  Yeah  To get the blood  Flowing  Flowing  Yeah  And not flowing that much  Yeah  Just to get it rising  Exactly  You know  You know  You get to the point  Where you can go negative  On that  Because it sounds a little  Like the married couple  That fights  So that they can have  Great sex after they make up  Could be  Well I don't remember that  We've never got that  You think you would have  Remembered that  I think a higher time 
[01:51:00]  Even in the days of york  But um  No but  I think  It seems to work  Sometimes a mixed temperament  Is very different to mine  At times  But when we start to work together  We suddenly seem to have the same  Yeah  And it's  You know  I mean everybody's  I think we're both very passionate  About what we do  We have different ways of working  I think everyone does  You're probably right there  I mean if we didn't care  We'd say  I would just sling a couple  Of songs together  And see it  And throw them against the wall  You know  Yeah  What  All I can think of 
[01:51:30]  Is Pirates of the  What was Johnny Depp's movie  Yeah  Pirates of the Caribbean  Let's go to Kevin in Philly  Kevin  Hey uh  I was going to say  If John Lee Hooker  Had a press conference  They better bring shovels  Because he's been dead  For about six months now  That's right  I forgot about that  Oh okay  Good point  Alright I'll punch him  Oh nice  And Matt Lauer  Refer to John Lee Hooker  Right  That last question  Wasn't bad  The interview so far  Is not awful  It's not as typical  At least I'll say 
[01:52:00]  It's not typical  Alright we got another  Quick one here  You go out there  And you put yourself  In a line  And you make sure  You're as good  As you possibly can be  And you don't  And you don't  Rest on your laurels  And you just give  The best show you can  And even if you feel  Terrible  You've got a cold  Your back's aching  And all that crap  And you just do it  And because you are  Putting yourself in your line  And those people  Have paid whatever money  Good money to see you  And you better  Be bloody good  What did they bleep  I don't know  Probably said fucking  Oh cause this is available  For everyone 
[01:52:30]  On XM or something  Oh no  Oh this came right off  The Today Show  Oh okay  And also  Well you know what  I know why they beeped it  It reminded me  When I was watching  An old tough crowd  Last night  And I did a joke  About the Trenchcoat Mafia  And Comedy Central  Beeped me saying  Trenchcoat  Are you kidding  No I'm not  I have the clip  They beeped me  Saying Trenchcoat  Why would they bleep  Trenchcoat  Because standards and practices  Are all fucking women  Anyway  That's probably why  Nick said something like that  I'm trying to  I can't fathom why 
[01:53:00]  Trenchcoat  In Trenchcoat Mafia  Would that be  They didn't want to  Too specific  Making fun of  Too specific  Columbine thing  Yeah  Too specific  Unless you're a cartoon  You can't say that  We're a real network  With integrity  Eesh  I hope the problem  With Chappelle's show  Is the fact that  They are screwing  The deal up  And he goes somewhere else  I almost think  That that's not it  To be honest with you  But whatever it is  Is a part of me  Rooting for them  To lose that show 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  Only because  It's such a smash  And it would just  It would  I don't care what happens  It would do nothing  But shed an awful light  On the people running  The network  Right  I don't care why  You lose it  Unless he dies  You have a lot  Of explaining to do  You're inside  That whole circle  You know some of these people  What's the word  On the street Jim  Why isn't  The Chappelle's show  Being taped  I've seen  Mustafa who's his manager  Used to work  At the Comedy Cellar  Who takes care of Dave  Now he's his manager  And I haven't asked him  Just because 
[01:54:00]  It's obvious  If it's a personal matter  He's not going to talk about it  Yeah  I've heard that  Chappelle's kind of like  Having a tough time  There's a lot of pressure  Again that's what  Some people say  And you know  Look 50 million dollars  You've got a top season too  It's a lot of pressure  But I read too  That he's a little nervous  Because he's the guy now  He's in charge  A lot of people  Depending on him  Maybe it's stressful  I mean him and Neil Brennan  Were doing that  Neil he's known for years  They were doing the show  I think just the two of them  Were basically writing  All this shit  And then they brought  Keith Robinson on  And it's got Brian Tucker  He's the record  Maybe it's just too much 
[01:54:30]  Overwhelming  I don't know  I've also heard Comedy Central  It's a money issue  But for some reason  I don't believe  The money issue thing  The pressure  I mean as a performer  That's got to be it  Because I thought  The deal was already worked out  Like I can't see  How it could be a money issue  You're not negotiating  The deal  As you're taping shows  You know  Like I remember  The deal being sewn up  A year ago  And there was a dollar figure  And everything  And they took care of it  So I can't see  How it could be money  He probably wants more money  And it's not making him happy  That he's locked into  That contract  Right  Well I think the potential  Was 50 million 
[01:55:00]  That was kind of  A blown out figure  He didn't get 50  I mean that was like  The absolute max  And he did amazingly well  He probably got 20  I mean 30  Who knows  I honestly don't know  I mean I know Dave  But I don't know him  Well enough to call him  And go hey  Are you okay  On a real level  Right  So  So the mystery continues  Yeah I really don't know  I mean whatever it is  I want to see if the show works  I actually do like him a lot  And I like everyone involved  With that show a lot  But there's a part of me  Just rooting against  Comedy Central  And just to lose that show  I don't care why you do it 
[01:55:30]  You lost a fucking mammoth hit  The biggest hit  Yeah  You're going to have  On the network  Because everything else  Is bombing  Except the trailer show  What are they putting on  That's working  Drawn Together  The reality show cartoon  Reno 911  It's a hit for them  But I mean  Is it  Anyone watching that  It's a pretty popular show  But you know  It's just  It's silly  It is what it is  It's a silly parody  Silly  But you know  But you're so afraid  Of anybody getting upset  You're supposed to be  You're supposed to be different man  You're not CBS 
[01:56:00]  You're supposed to  Represent something different  They want a tough crowd  To be  An entertainment driven show  Fucking Britney Spears jokes  They didn't like  We would shit on each other's shirts  Oh that's kind of dumb  Don't do that  Don't trash each other  And because Keith Robinson  Put it best  The guys that run that network  Are the guys that sat  In the front of the school bus  The guys that shit on each other  Are the ones that sat  In the back of the bus  And teased each other  Those are the guys  That sat in the front  He had to sit in the back  Of the bus regardless  Many different reasons  So that's the problem 
[01:56:30]  And they wanted  They said that was dumb  And they didn't like that  Yet they wanted it to be  A fucking entertainment driven show  And Britney  You know  Like you know  Hollywood news  Yeek  Oh yeek  Like hot soup  Just shit  There you go  I watched a bunch of them  The other day  I just found some  Hot on a tough crowd  And it was a funny  God damn show  Yeah  Absolutely  God it's irritating  They fucking yanked that  Eric  That concept you were talking about  The entertainment show  They just announced  The new show that's going on  After the daily show  Of course  After the daily show  Of course  That's what they want 
[01:57:00]  It's exactly what you're saying  But it's hosted by  Stephen Corbett  It's going to be like  A mock entertainment tonight show  Right after the daily show  That's exactly what they wanted  Aren't they giving Adam Carolla  A show  Oh god he's funny  Good times  Good times  God fuck you  He does stink actually  He is awful  Ugh  Good times  Good times  Don't get pregnant  Good times  They're giving him a show 
[01:57:30]  That sounded like the show  That Stephen Colbert is doing  Sounded just like it  So there's going to be  Two shows doing that  Of course there are  I just hate them  Colbert is a funny dude  To him  Oh yeah  Stephen Colbert is really funny  Very funny  So whatever  But that's what they wanted  To replace Tough Crowd  Yeah  Because they didn't like  The opinion  That fucking Herzog  Went on and said  High production  Low ratings  Bullshit  Bullshit  No  You gave no promotion  To that show  Now it happened  Before Doug got there  But the no promotion 
[01:58:00]  At all  It was the opinions  Coming out of it  That's what it was  It's coming out  That Doug Herzog  Was behind Family Guy  Being cancelled  The first time around  Yeah I've heard that too  Exactly  I think I heard it here  Actually from you guys  Good move  I read it in a few articles  All right  Genius I guess  Yeah really smart  We're going to take a break  When we get back  We got Sandy Kane  Outside the studio  There she is  Yep  She's got a new song  I think she's got  Something she wants to do  With a dildo  Dildo  And uh  Oh my god  She's just awful 
[01:58:30]  Where's Bob Kelly  Still limping his way over here  Idiot  Got her dildo  I hope right now  He's crumpled on 57th street  In pain  Holding his fucking  Bad leg  Blown out knee  Do we have the sound  Do we have  Where's the sound clip  Of him cracking his knee  Yeah we were supposed  To have that a while ago  Definitely  Hawk  Isn't it on one of their websites  Yeah because they had  Live video of him  Messing up his knee  Yeah they had video  We were supposed to get  That audio a while ago  A couple weeks ago  Ben  Ben you got the audio  Of Bob Kelly 
[01:59:00]  Breaking his knee there  It's on Torgasm  It's on Torgasm  We can't lift that clip  To play it  I thought we already had it  Yeah we never  That's what I thought too  Yeah we never played it  I'd love to get that on the air  All right  I saw Matt Frost  Who was with him  He said it was  The worst sound  It was like an animal  Dying the sound  That he made  When this happened  Oh see I want to hear that  Oh my god  You got to hear that  Lift that sound immediately  Is it better than this  Oh good lord  Oh good lord 
[01:59:30]  Kelsey  People falling down  Always funny  I got to play  The grape lady  Going in a break  That's one of my favorites  Oh that's a good one too  She makes some  Interesting noises  I don't know guys  That's kind of mean  That's what I mean  There's a whole thing  Going on out there  I just don't get  The mentality of  I don't know where it is  A mock entertainment tonight  There you go  Fucking mindless garbage 
[02:00:00]  Mindless shit  No balls  No real opinions  Colbert is doing a mock  O'Reilly Hannity type show  A mock personality  Driven news show  They only want  What they consider  They want the hip opinion  The smart opinion  To be the one  Coming from the left  It is so  Fucking predictable  And it's not a knock on Colbert  Because I really do think  He's great  Alright  We're going to go to break  With this  The reporter falling out  Of the vat of grapes 
[02:00:30]  She was stomping grapes  Fell down on her neck  And her face  And this is what happened  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Stop  Ow  Ow  Ow 
[02:01:00]  But, you know, all right, okay, whatever. 
[02:01:30]  I got to go.  Please, I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that he placed on us.  How do you get to tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars, jumping, grabbing.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore. 
[02:02:00]  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn, sleep.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went to a time machine and I already did it.  Everyone should just kill themselves, Robin.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything. 
[02:02:30]  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  Wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw, like, say. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  That was, it wasn't even flat.  Yeah, girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented a traffic accident.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called the fucking flag.  It's not exactly somebody's fucking invention. 
[02:03:30]  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo-hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:04:00]  That's pretty wild, actually.  Yeah, it's further online, actually.  We're just waiting for Bob Kelly to show up, and then we'll get Bob Kelly in here with Sandy Cain.  Bah.  Still got to try to play a few more of these psycho ex-girlfriend phone messages, Anthony.  Yes.  And you were just telling me something over there about a weatherman in Florida.  Yeah, this weatherman in Florida.  Listen to this story, Jimmy.  If you could just get the news, look up Florida weatherman 14-year-old boy or something. 
[02:04:30]  That might get it.  And sexy.  Yeah, he's in prison.  They did an interview with him on some website.  And apparently he was like one of the most successful or popular weathermen down on Channel 7, I think, down there in Florida.  And he's apparently a gay guy.  He's on his computer one night at home, and he's tinkering away and goes into an AOL chat room that was called Fathers and Sons. 
[02:05:00]  You know, there's trouble right away.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Bill Kamali.  Bill Kamali.  Bill Kamali.  He got five years in prison.  Five years in prison.  Lifetime probation.  Lifetime probation.  So he's screwing around online.  He's in this chat room.  He strikes up this conversation with some guy who's presenting himself as a 14-year-old boy.  This weatherman says a few inappropriate comments, which might even be listed there. 
[02:05:30]  Things about, do you like to kiss?  I would like to kiss you.  Things like that.  The weatherman's story is he just went into this room assuming it was other guys his age, kind of role-playing, things like that.  That was the only inappropriate thing that he typed in.  The 14-year-old then comes off, starts coming off as this real troubled kid, talking about how his stepfather is with his mother just for sex. 
[02:06:00]  He doesn't get any attention.  Kind of playing the part of the troubled 14-year-old boy.  So this weatherman starts talking to him, trying to, I guess, give him some support, and gives him his cell phone number.  So now the kid calls, and he said the kid wouldn't stop calling.  All the phone records show that the kid made the calls to the weatherman.  Gave him the address to where this 14-year-old kid lived. 
[02:06:30]  And the weatherman said, well, I'll stop up there and see you sometime.  He was going up to check out some, as he's put it, hurricane damage in this area.  The kid lived there, kind of close, about a 100-mile drive.  So he decides he's going to drive up.  He was going to drive up now because a few weeks have gone by.  And the boy had kept calling him and saying, why don't you call me?  Or why don't you talk to me online anymore?  You're giving up on me just like everyone else has. 
[02:07:00]  I thought you were different.  All kinds of stuff like that.  So the guy decides, I'm going up there.  I'll drop in on the kid.  He drives up, gets out of the car.  Boom!  Christmas music.  The cops pounce on him.  Yeah, knocked him down.  What did they do?  No, they met him at a parking lot in front of a convenience store.  Parking lot of a convenience store.  They just, like, jumped him, arrested him.  And some reason, he says he regrets this now, he pled guilty. 
[02:07:30]  He said that, you know, during the interrogations, they kind of tell you that if you don't plead guilty,  you're going to get twice as long a term and stuff like that.  And he claims he was completely set up by this whole thing,  that you could look at the phone records, everything else.  A lot of people say, what the hell is this guy doing?  And the whole M.O. is wrong.  Like, he shouldn't have been doing this in the first place.  His argument is, I'm role-playing in my own house. 
[02:08:00]  He's never had any history of this.  And why can't two people role-play in this way on a website?  So he's assuming the guy he's talking to might be another adult.  Another adult acting like he's a little kid or something.  And if that's what you're into, you should be able to trade this back and forth, blah, blah, blah.  But then you get to the point where he is going to visit what he says is some kind of mission of mercy  to help a poor kid out.  But, you know, you're not supposed to be going to drop in on 14-year-old boys. 
[02:08:30]  Well, Anthony, the correspondence grew increasingly explicit until the two agreed to meet in Fort Pierce  to spend a Sunday afternoon together.  Here's Kamal's quote.  I can't wait to see you, buddy, and give you a big hug and a sweet, passionate kiss, Kamal wrote.  Hopefully, we will fall in love with each other and no one would know.  Wow.  That's a quote, huh?  Yep.  He's a pedophile.  And the cops probably did.  You know what?  They probably did pursue him, but they knew we got one.  This guy's for real.  He's a fucking kid-toucher. 
[02:09:00]  And he was probably fighting the urge.  I mean, I guess these guys fight that urge.  I mean.  He went to call one of his friends on the way up.  He was driving up to see this kid who he thought was a kid.  He gets on the phone and tries to call one of his friends to ask him, should I be doing this?  Can I get in trouble for this?  But his friend wasn't home.  Yeah.  So the whole way, he knew something was a little wrong with this whole thing.  He knew what he was going for.  That big brother shit, stop it.  Right, right.  Stop.  Mm-hmm.  You know, if he met this kid online and they had like a legit friendship or whatever, 
[02:09:30]  and then he went up, then I'd say, wow, you know what?  They did set him up because he didn't say, let's kiss and fall in love.  Yeah.  The only reason he wasn't saying, look, I've got to eat your asshole immediately,  was the simple asterisk of this could be a cop.  Right.  Guaranteed he was worried this could be a cop.  I talked to a girl about dating, about, you know, two adults hooking up for a hooker thing.  And I'm like, eh, let's make sure it's not a cop.  So I know if you're talking about a fucking 14-year-old, you're panicking.  That's the only thing that kept this guy from honestly spewing out his agenda, 
[02:10:00]  which was, I want to fuck you or whatever it is he's into with a kid.  They had a poll on the website, and three to one was saying that he's, you know, guilty and full of shit about him with this story.  What dummy would say he wasn't?  I mean, look, I never once wound up in a fathers and sons chat room.  If you go into the fathers and sons chat room.  Let's do it as a goof.  I do.  Fathers and sons.  Now, this is also...  How many Scott, by the way, from Modesto's are going to be in the father-son chat rooms?  How many Connors?  I don't want to, you know, just our luck. 
[02:10:30]  A ton of our listeners will get arrested today.  Get arrested.  You do that on your own time.  Just go in there and fuck with the pedophiles.  His other defense was the fact that this is going on on AOL, which is supposed to be, you know,  they go on TV with their commercials about how safe this is,  yet a lot of the AOL, exclusive AOL chat rooms are full of predators and pedophiles  and they're themed to attract these people and give them this, you know, stomping ground 
[02:11:00]  to get in there and pick up on young children.  And why would AOL have something like that?  If there's a father and son chat room on AOL, you would assume it's people looking for fathers and sons  and that type of relationship and a big brother, a mentor, something like that,  why would AOL have that kind of thing?  Can I tell you the beauty of why they should keep those things?  Because what it is, it's putting a light bulb in a dark area where these little fucking kids,  I don't care what kind of pervert you are, I really don't, I'm a filth bag, 
[02:11:30]  but when it comes to kid touching, they just lounge and they hide in the dark,  so you put that light bulb up, which is these chat rooms and these fucking vultures,  circle around that light, and you know what, the more cops they put in these places, the better.  I love it when these cops pull these undercover operations.  And if you're in that situation, you've got to be pretty damn desperate  because they've got those rooms pretty...  They're monitored.  They're monitored like crazy at this point.  You're always reading stories about that, you know,  and there's a story almost every other day about someone getting caught doing this exact thing. 
[02:12:00]  Here's another part of the story, Anthony.  Kamal admitted arranging the meeting but denied planning to have sex with the boy.  He told agents he wanted to love the boy as a father figure but admitted communicating with other children...  Oh, but he admitted communicating with other children over the Internet and possessing...  Dun-da-da-da!  Child pornography.  There you go. Bye!  On his computer.  Adios!  Under terms of the plea bargain, Kamal also agreed to forfeit his computer equipment.  He said his defense to that was he gets a lot of emails with a lot of attachments. 
[02:12:30]  Wow, you really know the story.  I read the whole interview last night online, and he says he gets a lot of attachments and opens them up  and then just deletes them, and somehow they ended up on his computer.  Oh, whatever.  What is this guy doing, a shock jock radio program on the side?  Who the fuck is sending a weatherman?  That's what I'm saying.  Why should he be so lucky?  I mean, that is terrible.  You know what?  I've gotten a lot of sick things.  I've gotten the shit in the mouth in the tub, put over the girl upside down with the liquid dumps spewing out of her. 
[02:13:00]  I've gotten the worst thing sent to me, and I've never gotten that kind of crap.  Even the listeners know.  Who's opening anything?  You don't send that crap.  Who's opening files from the listeners?  Jesus Christ.  I'll open.  Some of them are funny.  I have not opened one thing.  I haven't opened up a file like that in a long time.  Nope.  Send them to Steve.  I've got a great one.  Let him get in trouble.  Called worm.exe.  I'm like, that's got to be a really funny one.  This just in.  Bob is close, having a tough time walking. 
[02:13:30]  Can we get one of our guys out there to see where he is and walk him in with a cell phone so we can see how he's doing?  Dude, my leg.  How about getting into a cab, cheapskate?  Where's he walking from?  Do we know his route?  His route?  Shithead.  No?  All right.  What else is going on?  What's up with the runaway bride, Anthony?  Well, she seems to have a lot of few skeletons.  And she went into a mental hospital, right?  That's a safe face, I guess, so she doesn't do time over this crime, I'm assuming. 
[02:14:00]  It's the Pat O'Brien strategy.  Or is she really a kook?  You screw up, you get your ass into rehab.  Yes, she seems to be kind of a kook.  She's in there for mental issues.  They're not really getting specific.  But this happened right on the, it was perfect timing.  The same time her previous criminal record came out, she likes to steal things.  Oh, really?  She's a shoplifter.  Nice.  She's a shoplifter.  And they had three of her mug shots in the paper today.  And they all looked exactly the same. 
[02:14:30]  Her big owl bug eyes with the little ruler behind her.  I don't know.  The old burn victim eyes.  The first mug shot isn't that bad.  Which one?  Oh, the first one doesn't look too bad because she's not possessed.  She's not possessed yet.  And her hair is kind of in her face a little bit.  Can I interrupt you?  Look at this mess.  Is Bob here?  Yeah, look at this guy.  Bob, get in here.  Bring Bob in.  Bring Bob right in.  Bob doesn't have to.  Look at him.  Oh, you poor bastard.  Hurry up.  Look at him working it. 
[02:15:00]  Hurry up.  He's yelling at him.  You're working it, man.  Wow, Bob.  Look at him work it.  Nah, holy shit.  What's up?  You really screwed up, didn't you?  Um, I'm a fat ass.  I'm a fat, you know, I actually, they tried to get me to watch the footage.  Yeah, you can't do it?  No.  Well, they brought us all into a room to watch the footage.  Yeah.  And they're like, uh, I'm sitting there going, I relive it in my head like 80 times a day.  Right.  It wasn't the slightest bit like funny or anything. 
[02:15:30]  No.  This is just, this is something, one of those horrible things that happened to you.  Dude, it was probably the, one of the best days of my life.  I mean, being on tour, luxury tour buses, went to Niagara Falls.  I threw the executive producer's hat off the falls.  It was beautiful.  Yeah.  I ran.  He chased me.  And then we played football.  We're having a great time.  See, that's where you made your mistake.  Dude.  And they said that I jumped like eight feet off the ground. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  They said you, I can't believe how high for a fat dude you got off the ground.  And I just, all I remember is.  You heard a sound.  And me just going.  I broke my leg.  I broke my leg.  I broke my leg.  Dude, dude, dude, dude.  Really?  Oh.  Just screaming it?  Dude, I screamed.  I screamed I broke my leg for probably around 20 minutes.  Did it hurt?  Such an ass.  What a dude.  He's such an ass.  I'm so glad that it was with my L.A. comic friends, though.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Instead of my New York comic friends.  Oh, of course.  Because, you know, if Norton, Patrice, and Keith were there, it'd be like,  Dummy, get up, you jackass.  Walk it off.  You'd still be laying in a field.  Now, what exactly, you know, medically happened to you?  I tore my ACL and my MCL.  Yeah.  In English to our dopey listeners.  The side of my knee, the muscle that holds your knee so it doesn't fall off.  The muscle that holds your knee. 
[02:17:00]  I got torn on the side.  I mean, it ripped off.  Oh.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  And the ACL.  Yeah.  And the ACL that I think is in the front of your knee.  Yeah.  Got torn.  So your kneecap. 
[02:17:30]  Your kneecap is just like floating there, though.  Just floating kneecap.  Yeah.  Wasn't connected to anything.  Well, now it's tightened.  The MCL tightened up a little bit, but the first couple weeks, we were doing Penn State.  It was like 8,000 people, and I was all excited, but I had my cast on.  Yeah.  And just before he was about to call my name, my knee popped off.  Whoa.  I was talking to Dane, and we were like, we were looking out, and he's just calling my 
[02:18:00]  name, giving my credits, you know?  And it's like 8,000 people.  It's like Bon Jovi.  Yeah.  Come out, and I'm all excited.  And then Dane turned, and I just, I just, I put my pressure on my leg, and it popped off.  God!  And I just fell like a fat sack of potatoes.  And Dane, Dane was looking the other way.  He turned around.  I was just on the ground, like, ah!  Oh.  But the camera, you know what's so funny?  These camera guys?  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  They don't even help you.  They don't care.  They're just documenting it.  They don't want the footage.  I just look in, and he's trying to do it.  I'm here to record the story, not be part of it.  I was trying to get a two-shot of me and Dane with me on the floor, and that's it.  Nobody helps.  I mean, the sound guy and the camera guy are just looking at me.  Yeah.  Dane's looking the other way.  I'm on the ground, like, ah!  And I had to wait until Dane turned around to get help, because these guys are just freaking  oh!  And the bad thing is that you said it happened while they were reading your credits, so that means  you had no time to get any kind of help. 
[02:19:00]  How much help can you get in the time it takes to say, Carson Daly Show?  I've done other shit, you ass.  I don't think I'm using O&A as a credit.  You're out of your fucking mind.  Really?  I have people go over to me, too.  They're like, dude, I hear you're on the show.  I hear you all the time.  You're great.  I'm like, dude, I've been on, like, three times, you ass. 
[02:19:30]  I'm like, thanks.  They think I'm Jimmy.  So did you do the gig, or did you walk it off?  Dude, I was...  Let me tell you something.  As soon as it happened, I'm on the ground.  I'm screaming, and I'm sitting there going, dude, I'm not getting taken off this tour.  And they thought it was some honorable thing I was saying.  Like, you know, like I'm Rocky.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't kick me off, Mick.  Don't cut me, Mick.  The only thing I was thinking about is the fucking money.  I'm not getting half a paycheck.  Wow.  When that DVD comes out, though, you're going to be the star. 
[02:20:00]  Know how many people are going to watch that part of the DVD?  And then it's going to be thrown on the internet, and everyone's going to be laughing at you  all over the world.  You don't even know how bad they're going to be laughing.  I heard some of the audio.  I haven't heard it yet.  I want a clip.  When do we get the exclusive audio of this?  There's one part that I really hope you guys don't get.  I say, someone was holding my hand because the pain was so bad, and then they let go of  my hand. 
[02:20:30]  And I go, hold my hand, hold my hand.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Hold my hand.  Like he's in a rice paddy somewhere in the NOM.  Don't let go, man.  Don't let go.  What happened after that?  The doctor said, push, honey.  You're doing great.  Any man holding on his own kneecap can drink out of my canteen any time.  Take the pain.  Take the pain. 
[02:21:00]  I want you to look at this piece of shit.  Tag him and bag him.  And as soon as I said it, because I was holding, I think it was Jay Davis' hand.  I'm holding it.  And it was like, I didn't want to cry.  Yeah.  Because that would look really bad.  Because there was nothing on TV to motivate it.  No little midget proposal.  This idiot will cry at a midget who really should have been just killed at birth, and his leg  is hanging off and he won't cry. 
[02:21:30]  This is Bob.  I was thinking about the after.  I didn't want to cry and my kneecap was broken in half, and I didn't cry.  But a little midget gets proposed to.  And you're welling up.  And I'm like, oh, God.  Midgets.  You know, midgets remind me of kids.  That's what happens.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So it's like a little kid.  Yeah, like a little kid getting married.  That's cool.  But, yeah, I said, I let go of his, he let go for some, I don't know who would let go.  Because you probably realized in a moment of clarity, he's holding your hand.  Two men holding hands in a field.  Two men in a field, right? 
[02:22:00]  Bus full of people.  As soon as he let go, I went, hold my hand, hold my hand.  Okay, terrific.  And then as soon as I said it, I was like, ah, fuck.  Ah, shouldn't have said that.  The dumb Dominican that did this to me.  Well, he did it.  You know, kind of fucked me up.  Yeah.  I'm sitting there waiting for the ambulance.  I didn't open my eyes.  And they put my leg up on a stool, right?  All of a sudden, my knee is like killing me.  It pops off the stool. 
[02:22:30]  This fucking Dominican was tired.  So he sat down on the stool.  Son of a bitch.  I hear the guy go, dude, don't sit down, don't sit down.  I'm like, did you just sit down on my leg?  This fucking dumb Dominican sits on my leg.  How did it happen?  What were you going for?  Jumping?  Yeah, you know what?  I quit.  We were playing on gravel.  I fell earlier, and I had marks of blood just pouring out of my back.  It was sharp rocks.  It was sharp rocks and uneven ground we were playing on. 
[02:23:00]  And we started off as, you know, like a fun little touch game.  But you know, guys, as soon as somebody scores a touchdown, it's like, all right, motherfucker.  That's competitive.  I got out of hand, and then I quit to smoke a couple cigarettes, and I was done, because  I didn't want to get hurt.  I didn't want to fuck around.  These guys are getting too rough.  So then this dummy goes, go in for me.  And I went in like an ass.  But this Dominican guy, one of the camera guys, you know, he's not used to American-style football.  He's used to, you know, the game of the foot, the soccer. 
[02:23:30]  Soccer.  So he's going up, and he's like, you know, grabbing me, pulling me down.  And I'm not even getting the ball.  I'm like, dude, you got to relax.  You can't, you know, this is too in touch.  You can't grab me and push me like that.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby.  I'm sorry, you know.  So we went up for the ball.  He was supposed to get it.  I went up to block it.  And he's like eight feet tall, and I blocked it.  I must have went up like 80 feet.  I swear to God, I jumped like a superhero.  Yeah.  And when I came back down, his leg grabbed my leg.  And I came down all my 200 and fucking. 
[02:24:00]  And whatever, something comes, came down on this leg on a hill.  Oh.  Unheavened surface.  A lot of weight.  Yeah.  All I heard was this.  That's all I heard.  You heard a sound.  Was that the stuff just ripping?  It was the sideways, and then the back would.  Was it tearing like Velcro?  Tearing like Velcro.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And I couldn't get out of my head. 
[02:24:30]  I still think about it at least once a day.  Hear the sound.  Yeah.  The exact sound.  Just.  And I picture my knee.  I actually felt the side of my foot hit the side of my leg.  Oh.  God damn.  It's exactly.  That's the same response.  That is rough.  When Norton tells me about duties on his chest.  Yeah.  It's the same.  It's the same feeling I get in my stomach.  Equally disgusting.  You get a rod?  Wow.  Well, that sounds very painful. 
[02:25:00]  So how long are you going to be in the cast and all that?  Well, you know what?  I still haven't seen it.  I saw a doctor on the tour, but I have to go see a doctor Friday.  I still haven't seen a frigging doctor yet.  Are you kidding?  No.  This could permanently fuck you up.  Yeah.  You've got to get to a doctor.  I just turned into a Jewish grandmother.  Are you serious?  This could permanently mess you up.  Why are you doing this to yourself?  You're being a jack-o-knipes is what you're being.  Where?  You really are.  Where?  Where?  Go see a doctor.  Where?  Yeah.  Bob tore his kneecap off.  You're kidding. 
[02:25:30]  How did it happen?  Oh, no.  I came up like a bat out of hell.  A little pissant.  Oh, man.  Why don't you go to a doctor?  Yeah.  Why don't you go to a doctor?  That's not like...  I don't know.  I called for an appointment.  I wanted to go to a good doctor.  Yeah.  Because I have health insurance finally in my life.  That's exactly what it sounds like, you son of a bitch.  That's what it's...  Tearing muscle and... 
[02:26:00]  Sinew.  Maybe if you got a piece of Velcro that was more than a frigging two centimeters long.  Yeah.  A piece of Velcro.  What did that do?  Hold two buttons onto something?  Good sound effects.  Yeah, boy.  It really drives home the seriousness of the whole thing.  This is like old school radio, everybody.  Eric just ripped it off his sneakers.  So why wouldn't you see a doctor right away?  I mean, you need an operation and all that crap, right?  Because New Wave, the production company that put it together, and then there's Dane Cook. 
[02:26:30]  You know, Dane paid for most of this, probably most of it out of his pocket, you know, because  he owns it.  And there was an insurance, you know, who's paying for this?  I was like, you know what?  I'll fucking...  I paid 300 bucks a month for medical, so, you know, let me get...  I'll go.  But it took me...  These doctors are so good, I guess, that, you know, they get a lot of shit.  An appointment?  I guess a lot of people have ACLs that need to be fixed.  I don't know.  That seems like something that's just kind of... 
[02:27:00]  It sounds fucked up, right?  Maybe gets you right away.  It should have been taken care of already.  I went to the guy that I'm going to see website, and then I called this other guy who was going  to give me an appointment the next day.  Yeah.  And he's got, like, a flat HTML page with a picture that his, you know, daughter took  at a picnic.  Oh, my God.  You're in trouble.  And then my guy that I'm going to see has, like, awards he won from Harvard, and he's  Asian.  Well, you need that.  I mean, I might wait.  You know, Asian guys got his shit together.  Of course.  This guy's bald, you know, he looks...  But can't it heal all fucked up?  Yep.  I don't know, dude.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:30]  Wait a minute.  Norton, did you just say, yep?  It can.  Listen to me.  How do you know?  Well, Kaiser Soze, I know what happens.  How do you know?  Well, your knees go backwards naturally, you flamingo.  You don't have ligaments.  I'm just amazed you haven't taken care of this yet.  Yeah, that's...  I'm going Friday.  I can't.  You're going to be a gimp.  I can't.  No, I'm not going to be a gimp.  You might be.  I'm not going to...  What do you mean a gimp?  Yeah, you're going to have...  What are you saying?  You're going to have problems the rest of your life.  He's got his fucking...  Dragging your foot. 
[02:28:00]  Orthopedic white shoe.  Oh.  One sneaker, one white shoe.  One being dragged.  One heel bigger than the other.  Nothing funnier than going out on stage with those metal crutches that go around your wrists.  I was supposed to be on crutches.  Really?  But I'm so...  The night it happened, I just started eating.  Yeah.  And I haven't stopped.  And now what?  The crutches hurt your arms from...  Dude, I actually had to use crutches.  We came to New York for like a day, and they wanted to...  There's Master Pose walking stick.  Oh, Master Pose walking stick.  Fantastic. 
[02:28:30]  That's a nice...  Why does he need a walking stick?  He's in perfect health, Master Pose.  It's for beating people up.  Of course it is.  If you push a button on this, a sword comes out and a friggin' Chinese star's fly.  Samurai sword, yeah.  The phones have exploded.  A lot of people have advice for you, Bob.  Jeff in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  We're hanging with Bob Kelly today.  Yeah, listen, about three or four years ago, I kind of jumped off of a short deck and tore  my ACL, dude, first of all, I want to totally concur with Bob, that sound you hear, that  you like feel it in the back of your teeth, and it's so awful, and I didn't even get it 
[02:29:00]  taken care of at first, and when I finally went to the doctor, he's like, well, you know,  you're probably all right not taking care of it, whatever.  Now, if I walk down the street and just take a weird step or like a half step, my knee  will shift right up the side of my, you know, if it's enclosure and pop again every time.  It's awful, Bob.  Did you get it fixed?  No.  I'm getting mine fixed.  I'm not an animal.  I'm going Friday.  I'm just taking a long time.  Get it fixed, you fucking ape.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:29:30]  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What?  Hey, you, go.  What's up, Bob?  Yeah, I tore my ACL out, and I stressed my MCL as well.  That's what I do.  And, you know, I know the surgeon in Boston, the path surgeon.  Yeah?  He's the man.  He did carry while he was running for president and stuff like that.  When Kerry tore his ACL?  Kerry, no.  Kerry had his shoulder strain.  This guy's the best.  How hard is this guy to get in to see, Ben?  I got in to see him, and I'm just an average Joe. 
[02:30:00]  Really?  You're not somebody important?  Thanks, Jimmy.  I didn't say that.  That was Bob.  That was Jimmy.  Okay.  I know you're not important.  I wouldn't ask you.  I can send you guys pictures if you want.  I have pictures from the arthroscope inside my knee.  Ooh.  Wow, that would be exciting viewing on FandryMusic.com.  They have...  I have before and after, and then Bob, and Jimmy.  First of all, it doesn't heal on its own, you dumb piece of shit.  Dude, this is a serious... 
[02:30:30]  Can you stop misquoting me, you horse's ass?  I didn't say it did heal on your own.  I asked him why he didn't go to a doctor.  What are you listening to some other local show, and then just putting my...  What are you...  I didn't say that, sir.  Jesus Christ.  He did kind of say that.  I know what you're saying, dude.  He did kind of say that.  I said go to a doctor.  I don't care if they amputate the fucking thing.  I know it's not going to heal on its own.  Jimmy, what are you talking about?  Slobodan Milosevic was right.  Stop misquoting me, you bossing moron. 
[02:31:00]  Punch out, then.  Punch out.  Okay.  Punch out.  Bye, Dan.  You stink, Dan.  Punch out.  Mighty.  Let's go to Duke.  Duke's laughing his ass off.  Duke in Jersey, what's up?  Oh, Duke, uh, professional athletes get that shit fixed immediately so it doesn't get all  fucked up.  Who knows you haven't seen my torso, you shithead.  I'm not a professional athlete.  I'm a barrel-chested fatso.  That's what I was saying, fat boy.  You gotta get that shit fixed yesterday. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, well, you know what?  Apparently, friggin', the goop that I'm going to see doesn't have me on the friggin'  top of his priority list because I don't make a millionaire playing shortstop, shithead.  I'm a fatso that tells dick jokes in Jersey.  Uh-oh.  That's it, Danny.  Yeah.  Ow.  He's laughing.  He's laughing at me.  He's laughing at me.  He's laughing at me.  He's laughing at me.  Then why did Jimmy say that he does play shortstop?  I don't know.  I just decided, I actually said third base.  Oh, okay.  I apologize to Dan in Boston.  Let's go to John in Arizona.  Everyone has opinions about Bob Kelly. 
[02:32:00]  Go ahead, John.  Hey, Bob.  Hi.  Hey, it's not going to be right, man.  I hurt mine like May of last year, and I got my surgery in October.  I mean, I just had to wait, and they pull this tendon from like inside.  It's right by your stroke.  They pull this like two-foot length of tendon out and fix it.  From where?  It's like up in your upper thigh.  You say stroke them?  I mean, my bag hurt more than my knee after I had surgery.  Wow.  Your balls are connected to your back?  No, it's like they run this tube up, and they harvest a tendon, and they make you a new way. 
[02:32:30]  Did you say harvest?  Harvest an tendon.  They get a harvest a tendon from your scrotum.  From your scrotum, and then they put it in your knee.  Were you asking a girl to help you put a couch in the back of your van?  You put her in a cold pool, your knee bends.  It was a dirt bike accident.  I saw it.  It twisted all the way around.  You get out of the shower, your knee's all wrinkled and stuck to you in tight.  Yeah, I cried like a girl.  I did the same thing.  You cried?  I didn't cry.  I just asked for a hand, a little hand.  Yeah, Bob's on a hold of a man's hand. 
[02:33:00]  Bob's on a hold of a man.  He didn't cry.  He just put a cock in his mouth and said, all right, thanks a lot, guys.  But I'm telling you, it hurts.  I mean, when they pull this tendon out, I mean, my leg didn't hurt as bad as it did where  they, like, ripped this tendon out of my leg.  Why did it hurt?  Did you go to Mexico and they didn't put you under?  No, no, no.  It's a good doctor.  But I'm saying, the way they, have you seen the surgeries, how they, like, drip and pull  on your body?  It's like they just beat my bag the whole time.  You know, like a punching bag.  We were punching his scrotum for his knee for some reason.  Bob, be prepared.  They're going to punch you in the balls.  That used to turn me on. 
[02:33:30]  What is this guy talking about?  Jesus Christ.  No, I'm telling you.  No, listen.  They harvest the tendon from up in your ear.  Stop saying fucking harvest.  I'm not a goddamn cornfield.  They take it.  They take it from your thighs.  Jimmy said you were a cornfield.  He did say that.  He did.  I apologize.  Remember him saying that you were a cornfield.  Hey, look it up on the way.  I'm telling you.  It's not bullshit in here.  All right.  Very good.  Hey, John, punch it out, guys.  Yeah, I'm just going to punch it out a long time ago.  Punching his sack.  Let's go to what hospital is he at.  Hey, we've got to work on his knee, but, hey, why don't you 
[02:34:00]  punch his balls for a while?  This guy says you're going to be in a cast for five weeks.  Chris in Connecticut.  Hey, I did the same thing playing hockey last year,  and I was in a cast for five weeks.  Then they take the thing off, and they say I've got to go for major surgery,  and it was nasty.  It takes a long time to heal.  Did you get surgery and then put in a cast and then get surgery,  or did you get a surgery and then put in a cast and then surgery again?  I got put in a cast, then surgery.  And then surgery.  So it was a surgery, then cast.  No, no, no, cast, surgery, cast. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, right.  Cast, surgery, cast.  Yeah.  So that's what I'm...  Yeah.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You go.  They take tendons out of a cadaver.  Hey, out of a cadaver, right.  Yeah.  It's nasty shit, man.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Then you get weird dreams at night because you've got, you know,  a piece of a dead person in you.  Yeah, but that's...  You snapped your ACL off.  You're right.  I didn't do that.  I just...  I tore it.  I didn't tear it off.  It's not snapped in half.  This guy is saying you're going to have cock problems. 
[02:35:00]  Glenn in California.  Glenn?  You mean more cock problems?  Yeah, probably more cock problems.  All right, excited boy.  Relax.  I know.  Look at Glenn.  The guy that's going to have cock problems.  Yeah, more cock problems.  You're absolutely right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Chris Berman, delivery.  We can't hear you.  All right.  Slow down a little bit.  No, that tendon, like you said, is attached to the testicle,  and the testicle controls whether or not you can get a hard-on. 
[02:35:30]  Let me tell you something.  I'm trying not to cheat on my girlfriend, so I can't get a hard-on anyways.  Okay?  My penis is inverted.  I actually grew back my foreskin.  Oh, Jesus.  So I'm not worried about my cock.  I'm worried about walking so I get food.  Are you worried about walking?  Yes.  Listen to this guy.  What station are you at?  I know.  Are you on QVC?  Do you sell knives late at night?  We got 400 knives for 19 bucks. 
[02:36:00]  Totally.  All right.  He's out of there.  Let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Hey, what's up?  They're lying to you.  I had my whole ACL done.  What they do is they take part of your kneecap, part of your shin bone, and the middle ligament,  draw a hole into your thigh, a hole into your shin, and then put screws in there for the rest of your life.  I'd rather have somebody punch my balls.  What are you talking about?  Go to the punch-the-ball doctor.  He's better.  Definitely get the machine that you just lay there eight hours a day, and it flexes your leg.  Yeah, let me get one of those.  What is wrong with you? 
[02:36:30]  What do you think you're talking to?  What do you think I am?  A linebacker for the Cowboys?  Just one or two more here.  Tony in Miami.  Tony?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what I started doing is about a month after I tore my ACL, I started strength training,  so it made my recovery like ten times faster.  So, Bob, get your fat ass on a treadmill or something.  Get you a lot better.  Do some training?  What do you mean?  You mean walking?  No, the doctor even said it, because I was squatting like a lot.  But the thing is, I couldn't do any lateral movement, because your ACL controls your lateral movement. 
[02:37:00]  Right, and my MCL.  Don't forget my MCL.  Oh, your MCL.  But still, you need to do, like, so your recovery is going to be, like, a lot faster if you're strong going into surgery.  You know, because, you know, muscle memory and all.  You know, you guys don't know about muscle memory.  I have been taking around four craps a day, though, since this happened.  Yeah, maybe you'll get out of the bond cycle, too, get some muscle.  That's because of all the food you're eating.  Your body's trying to get rid of at least some of it.  You don't understand.  The worst part about this is not the walking, not all this crap.  I have to get fully naked to take a shit. 
[02:37:30]  What?  That's the only thing that I can make, is that I can't take, because the elastic band, when you sit down, both your knees bend, when you have your pants on.  Right.  I have to take my pants off.  Completely off and keep one leg straight.  I have to be completely naked, like I'm in Japan shitting into a hole in the ground.  Every day, at least four times a day.  I feel like just a creep.  That must be something.  It's the worst thing ever.  Sweatpants turned inside out at the bottom of the ankles, like hanging off.  I had to buy the sweatpants that pull off, so I just go into the bathroom, I rip my sweatpants off, and then it takes me an hour and a half to button them back up. 
[02:38:00]  What do you play for the New York Knicks?  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Going into the game.  Just nude on the toilet.  With that collapse, like the way he fucking Pyle collapsed out of the toilet before he killed himself.  That back smash against the septic tank.  There's something so dirty about being completely, you feel dirty being completely nude shitting.  Just want to know your pants are right there.  Yeah, if I have my pants on, I feel okay, but naked, I feel dirty like I'm doing something bad. 
[02:38:30]  Honest to God, that's the way I like to shit.  Like it's something sex-like.  You like to shit naked?  Absolutely the most comfortable way to shit.  No bullshit.  Not yet.  Completely naked.  I'm paranoid that my shirt's going to hang in the back and I'm going to get logs on it.  That's always a fear.  Bunch my shirt up under my fat tits.  Do you make the girl get completely naked or she can leave her underwear on?  Dominators will normally leave a bra on.  It's their one weird attachment to staying closed.  It's so truthful.  I was trying to be funny and apparently you took that deadly seriously.  I took it as a very serious question. 
[02:39:00]  Sorry.  All right.  Hey, let's go back to the phones here.  Rick in California.  Hey, what's going on, Owen A?  Hey.  Hey, little Jimmy.  We love you.  Thank you, Rick.  Hey, Kelly, if you've got to get a tendon,  and ask if you can get a tendon out of a cadaver from a black guy.  Long one.  Oh, sorry.  I'd have a big dick, right?  Maybe.  All right.  Ant's infected tooth from Canada.  Hey, Bob, are they going to put an escalator in the cellar  so it can carry you halfway up to the restaurant 
[02:39:30]  only to be embarrassed by a big star?  Making reference to the not you.  It was kind of wordy, but he actually pulled it out at the end, didn't he?  I kind of gave a good mental image of you on an escalator.  Leave it his name, Ant's Infected Tooth.  That's a long fucking name.  He is a wordy ass.  Actually, Seinfeld, I think, emailed me.  Really?  I swear to God.  Oh, hey, there you go.  Are you sure it was Seinfeld?  Dude, it said, not you.  Yeah.  And it said, Jerry Seinfeld.  That's it.  Give out his fucking email address.  Hang on.  I want to.  Oh, okay.  I'm just making sure you don't slip and give it out.  Well, it said, it said, Jerry Seinfeld at, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:40:00]  JerrySeinfeld.com.  Don't tell me, send not you to me.  I should give it out.  No, you shouldn't.  All right.  That's a bad form.  What did he say to you?  He just wrote, not you, but I went to the actual site.  It was his site from Sony.  Really?  It was his site, and it said, it was probably some jackass intern who, you know.  Maybe.  Something.  But if it's his site, now we all know the email address, because it's just Jerry Seinfeld.  Well, I'm sure.  No, no.  There's something else at the end.  Oh, there is.  Yeah, but I don't know.  Just adding that in so people don't.  No, I swear to God.  Yeah?  You'll never figure it out. 
[02:40:30]  No?  Yes, you will.  No.  Okay.  No, you won't.  You can't.  Guarantee he has his email address.  Ladies, if you want to contact Seinfeld, send your naked pictures to Jerry Seinfeld at  yellowtreats at AOL.com.  He will get them.  Right.  He also has a new one.  It's at robert at robertkellylive.com is his new other site.  Robertkellylive.com.  That was the sound right there.  I hate that sound.  We promised some psycho ex-girlfriend phone calls.  Oh.  Love them.  I'm just going to move on a little bit.  What number will we on when, uh... 
[02:41:00]  We're up to, uh, we did 10 so far out of 50.  You want to explain this to Bobby there?  This is a girl who, a guy and a girl broke up, um, and he recorded all these psychotic  messages she left him after they broke up, and he put them on the internet, and there  was 50 of them, and she is a crazy bitch.  She's a little needy, a little sad.  A little?  Uh, if you want to reach out and hold Jimmy's hand during some of these calls.  I'm sure you're going to get all worked up.  A lot of people said that you'd probably be crying if you heard these.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Because they're very sad.  I guess she worked for, uh, he worked for a phone company.  She had a problem with the phone.  Yeah.  I'm trying to get everyone up to speed here.  Only if her voice is high, like, squeaky like helium.  Ugh.  Ooh.  Like a little midget.  And she keeps saying how she's done with him, but she keeps calling back.  Yeah.  Faved message.  Wednesday, February, 7th, 10, 08 PM.  You know, as if I should even assume, I'm assuming you don't give a shit about me, and I'm assuming 
[02:42:00]  that since you're not taking my calls anymore, and I hurt myself, and you don't give a flying  shit, and, uh, from everything you told me today, and how you're not willing to work things  out, and how you're just, you know, how you feel in general, you just don't want to be  with me anymore, but you know what?  This is up and down.  I mean, every couple days, you know, this is what happens with you.  It's a roller coaster, and it's fucking torturing me.  It's killing me, and maybe it's doing the same to you, but you don't show it as well, and I pretty 
[02:42:30]  much need to know, so, because I'm seriously, I'm sure you can realize.  I'm going through a hard time.  Maybe you don't care, but you probably are aware of it, and I need to make a change in  my life, big time, and obviously, I have a thing here.  I thought I had you, but I don't have that, so, if I'm wrong, I would really like you to, um, 
[02:43:00]  call me, or step over, or do something, like, really impulsive, because, you know what?  I'm pretty much at the bottom of my barrel, and, you know, I've had a lot of patience going  back and forth with this, and, you know, continuing to chase after you, but you know what, Mark?  So many times, you chase after someone, you pretty much can't do it anymore.  There she goes.  And I guess what you're telling me is, yes, you don't want this anymore, and I can respect 
[02:43:30]  that, but I need to leave, because this is just not working out for me here, and, uh,  I thought you and I were working out, but we're not, and I, I don't have anything else  here, and I'm not saying this for any other reason but the truth.  I've fucked someone in Allentown.  I could get a job for a while, and I don't want to go, but I know that you don't care, 
[02:44:00]  and you don't want to be with me, and you treat me like shit, and...  She fucked someone?  That's why I can't sue me, sue me for even making this, yet another phone call, yet another  phone call.  What the hell am I doing?  Man, something is seriously wrong with me.  All right, I gotta go.  Bye.  Wow, she's trying everything.  She, she hinted at, uh, suicide yesterday.  Yeah.  And then said, oh, thanks for calling, I'm, I'm fine. 
[02:44:30]  No thanks to you, because you didn't call me, you didn't show any concern there.  Now she's using the tact that, uh, look, look, I'm leaving.  I'm going to Allentown for this job.  I'm moving on.  So if you want me, we gotta figure this out now.  Do you guys hear, I don't know if you guys got the mass email, it was actually pretty  cool.  Uh, Eric Logan sent out an ass email about these, uh, these, these tapes, and he said  that, uh, she's having a tough time with the breakup.  Mm-hmm.  That might have been better if I didn't say he sent out an ass email.  Ass email.  Yeah, he did say that. 
[02:45:00]  Where is Elo?  Why doesn't he call us anymore?  Very busy.  All right, you want to hear another one there, Bob?  That one was tame, I mean, they get better.  Yeah, that was, that was really, that was kind of creepy, though.  There's 50 of these.  I've gotten, I've gotten, that really, yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of the call that I think every guy has gotten at some point in his life.  That's creepy.  That's also the kind of call every guy's made at some point in their life.  Oh, sure.  That was fucking creepy, man.  Change message.  Wednesday, February, 7th, 10, 19, PM.  You know, you're making me go out of my mind, and I'm not kidding. 
[02:45:30]  Oh.  I'm not kidding.  I can't handle this like you can.  I'm begging you, as a human being, to please call me back.  Oh, man.  Please call me back.  Yeah.  Please call me back.  I'm not doing well.  Please call me back.  You know, as a human being, please, as someone who once cared about me, can you please call me back? 
[02:46:00]  Please.  Please.  Well, why?  To replay the message, please call me back.  I'm trying to use that phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[02:46:30]  Arrgh!  Hey, we got Sally.  Wow.  We got a woman on the line.  Sally from Illinois.  What's up?  I'd like to apologize for the whole female sex.  Yeah.  God, these are, you know, I just, I want to slap her.  You know, like that woman did on the airplane, in the movie Airplane.  Oh, yeah, big line of people waiting to smack her in the face.  Oh, my God, and she says the thing, if from one human being to another, I don't think she's human. 
[02:47:00]  There's something wrong.  Well, you know, Sally, it was like your brother Davey once said, you have to treat people with a lot of love and respect.  Oh, yeah, but you have to call me back.  What the?  Awful.  Bye.  Thank you, Sally.  Very good call from Sally.  Want to do another one here?  Yeah.  We'll only do five today.  Do you have one with a gunshot in the background?  That would be a perfect ending to this bit.  Mark.  Yeah.  Saved message, Wednesday, February 7th, 10th, 23 p.m. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, Mark, you know, I just want to tell you, I've never been like this before, so I don't think it's all me.  I think you're kind of helping it along, and I'm going to call my mother soon.  And I know she's sleeping and she's sick.  I know she's sleeping and she's sick.  And it's 11-23.  And I'm going to ask her to call you, because I keep telling her that you're going to take care of me. 
[02:48:00]  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  I don't want to do that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I don't want to do that.  I meant to do that.  So can you please call me back?  Okay.  How can you be so cold to me?  I know you are, but what am I?  Even if we fight, I have told you I love you more than anything.  More than anything in this world.  Well, well.  And I just need a friend right now. 
[02:48:30]  Your eyes are getting glassy.  Every time she comes back, someone else is sick.  My little cousin tore his ACL.  Why can't you help us out?  My uncle has hemorrhoids.  You're not calling back.  I thought we were two human beings. 
[02:49:00]  I have to deal with this all by myself.  My friend Bob ate bad pork and threw up, and I have to deal with it all by myself.  She told him about that pork.  Oh, did you not?  Yeah, he was telling us about you throwing up because of bad pork.  You ate old pork.  Wee cold pork.  Wee cold pork.  Lazy ass with a fucking busted dimple egg eating weak old pork alone in an apartment.  I didn't want to go to the ATM to get money to get new food. 
[02:49:30]  So the pork was in there.  Pork is safe when you leave it past its price.  If there's little white bugs on it, can you eat it?  Why can't I?  It wasn't the pork that got me sick.  It was the sauce that was on the pork.  Of course.  I thought it was your house guest at the time.  No, he had pork, and after a morning of cigarettes and coffee, it was pork.  Five dumps a day and throwing up.  Your body can't get rid of that shit fast enough.  It's got to come out of every hole.  I was just sweating.  I was hot and cold.  I was sweating. 
[02:50:00]  I turned pale white, and stupid Jimmy's like, come on.  I want to go get a frigging latte.  I want to go get a soy latte.  Let's go, stupid.  I'm like, dude, I think there's something wrong.  I'm going to puke.  Then I had a hobble, but I couldn't puke because I almost had to get naked to puke because my  knee wouldn't bend.  You can't kneel.  I looked like a frigging ballerina because I was on one knee with this leg sticking straight  out, puking.  He was doing that on my forehead.  You know that breathing you're doing here?  Oh, the breathing.  The pre-puke breathing. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, uncomfortable walk to the bathroom.  Yeah, it was brutal.  I don't think I've ever thrown up for any other reason besides drinking.  God, you're like, I've never thrown up for being sick or never thrown up from something  I ate.  It's only from drinking.  You ever had like a hand hold the back of your head and push it down too far?  My classic story.  No such thing as too far, Jimmy.  My classic story.  I was going to the ocean or whatever on Long Island and we went to the deli beforehand and  I got a nice ham and cheese sandwich with mayo. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  I swear to you, it was at least 90 degrees out and a little thing of potato salad.  To the beach.  Thinking nothing of it.  Good beach food, you idiot.  Only Doritos and beer.  Eventually got to the lunch when I got a little hungry, ate the whole thing.  All the potato salad and the ham and soy sauce with the freaking mayonnaise.  And then I was supposed to go, well, I did end up, but I had to go all the way out east  and my brother invited me over for dinner and he was making like a homemade crab cakes  and stuff.  I spent the entire night in the bathroom puking and shitting at the same time. 
[02:51:30]  That's rough when you got a pinwheel on the ball.  It got to the point.  It's a tough situation.  It got so bad that not only was I dry heaving because everything was out of me, but my body  was so sick.  I swear to you, I was still shitting, but nothing was coming out.  I was dry heaving from my butt.  It's a true story.  Like the muscles were still going, but nothing was coming out anymore.  That's how sick I got.  Dry heaving from his asshole.  I swear to you.  When it's just complete liquid. 
[02:52:00]  It's all just muscle control just trying to shove shit out of you.  Like a Selma fire hose coming out your ass.  And it was my brother and his new wife at the time and still kind of getting to know  her and all, you know.  And she's like, is he ever coming out of the bathroom?  No.  Dude, I couldn't even make it to the car with, you know, some action happening.  It was the worst.  We got time for two more of these calls today, and then we'll move on.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Sage message.  Wednesday, February 7th, 10th, 25th, AM.  Dear God, I'm just praying.  Please.  Please don't leave me a friend to me.  Please.  Okay.  Please.  I'm praying to God that you will.  Please just be a friend to me.  Why do you have to be so cruel? 
[02:53:00]  Why do you have to be so cruel to me?  Hello, exactly.  I don't know what I'm trying to do to make this work out.  I just want...  I just want...  Don't go ahead!  Don't go ahead!  Don't go ahead!  Don't go ahead!  Don't go ahead!  Help me.  I got nowhere else to go!  To reply!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[02:53:30]  I got nothing else.  You can act like a man!  Wow, she is distraught.  I can't get enough of these calls.  Saved message, Wednesday, February 7th, 10th, 28th p.m.  Maybe you're meeting another chick right now. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, boy.  Now the turn comes.  She turned again.  All right, why am I crying?  Fuck this guy.  Well, let me tell you what I'm going to do.  Saved message, Wednesday, February 7th, 10th, 28th p.m.  Maybe you're meeting another chick right now.  Maybe that's why you can't take these calls and check any more voicemails, huh? 
[02:54:30]  All I know is I wouldn't wish this on anyone.  And, you know, Mark, despite the fact that we didn't get along, I don't know why you had to do this to me.  And I don't hate you.  I love you.  Why did you have to do this to me?  I don't understand.  Someone check Bob. 
[02:55:00]  I think you got some teary-eyed balls, man.  Dude, I'm fucking...  I'm actually remembering.  I've gotten these fucking phone calls, man, and your balls sick to you.  How about on the mic there, bud?  Yeah, how about...  How about the rest of the country listeners instead of, you know, us three?  That's not where we were in my living room.  Guys, you know, thanks for coming over.  Thanks for the bun cake there, Opie.  I appreciate that.  Try the pork.  Would you guys like some pork?  Pork.  And some sauce?  What's the name of the fridge? 
[02:55:30]  You had it in his pants pocket?  A little pork.  Yeah, dude, this is just...  I mean, I'm remembering phone calls I got, man.  You know what?  It is funny, but, you know, this shit.  And, you know what, this guy's probably done this a million times.  This girl gives a fantastic head or something.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he went back, said, this bitch is nuts.  I got to get away, but went back.  This bitch is...  And now he's finally like, fuck this bitch.  You can't dump her, though.  And now she's...  Yeah, she's got... 
[02:56:00]  Something's wrong with her.  Should we do one more, or should we just call her?  I got to pee, badly.  You got to pee?  Yeah.  You want to do one more?  We'll do one more.  I'd love to hear...  Oh, let's do another.  What would you love to hear, Ant?  I'd love to hear another.  One more?  Okay.  Sage Message.  Wednesday, February, 7th, 10.  39 p.m.  Um, I would really like you to call me tonight.  It's now 10.37, and there's not much time left, and this night is fucked, and our relationship  is fucked, because you don't want to make it work. 
[02:56:30]  And, uh, oh, I know, it's fucked for a lot of other reasons, right?  But, uh, I don't want to make it work, but in any event, I have a ticket on hold for Friday  to go back to Ellentown, and I'm going to tell my boss that I can't make it next week  for this training, because I have a family crisis, and I, honestly, I can't do this anymore,  Mark.  I'm not fucking around.  I need to know that you care about me, and that this isn't just one of your, you know, 
[02:57:00]  valleys, and that you're going to come apologizing in a day or two, or maybe a couple days, and  you're going to be feeling bad, and feeling like you miss me, and feeling sorry for everything.  I love you, and I need to know that you love me.  I, I, I gotta get out of here.  I can't stand it anymore.  I don't want to be alone anymore. 
[02:57:30]  And it's just a risk of losing my job, and losing everything.  What do I got here?  Nothing.  A fucking lead that I'm going to have to break.  But I can't do it anymore.  And I know you checked your messages, so please call me back.  Please.  I don't want to have to leave.  But I, there's nothing here.  In other words, I don't want to have to leave you.  But you're not even fucking returning my phone calls. 
[02:58:00]  Please call me back.  The old Scott Peterson solution.  These calls are addicting.  Can we play one more before we take a break?  I only want to play a few today, but.  Page message.  This is your one.  Okay.  February 7th.  10.  42.  P.M.  Okay, well, it's done. 
[02:58:30]  I'm out of here.  And I know you checked all your, these godforsaken voicemails I've left you.  I called you, I don't know how many times again tonight.  And, um, well, I guess that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter that I'm going back, so I just thought I'd fill you in.  So, you have a good life, and I guess I'll catch you in the next one, maybe.  Bye.  All right, she's out.  Is that a good, that's a good place. 
[02:59:00]  She's empowered herself.  She's moved on.  How many more calls are there?  Um.  32.  I just got to do the math.  30, yeah, 32 to go.  All right, she's done.  She's moved on.  But there's 30 more, yeah, 32 more calls after that.  But that was the convincing call.  She's done.  Hey, I'm out of here.  Good luck.  We'll meet another life.  She had some taken off or whatever, but through a quarter or whatever.  There's actually more than that.  More than 50.  Yeah.  Should we stop there?  Because she's done.  Yeah, she's done.  We'll pick up tomorrow, I guess.  And maybe later today.  When we come back, can I discuss Ellen and how awful this is? 
[02:59:30]  Again?  Did she dance again?  It's even worse.  Yeah, it's getting really awkward at this point.  She's just got a bell on the dancing.  Oh, it's special.  She's been dancing for two years.  Oh, it's so special.  She dances.  The audience dances with her.  Oh, they're all happy.  Midwest rubes.  Yeah.  Why can't she tear something as she's dancing?  Now, that would be great TV.  All right, and Sandy Cain's going to join the program next as well.  Oh, yeah.  And, Anthony, we started on Runaway Bride.  Oh, yeah.  And then Bob Kelly hobbled in here, and we were thrown off track. 
[03:00:00]  So we might touch on that as well today.  Who's Sandy Cain?  That's her right out there.  She's silly.  She's silly.  Yeah, she's silly.  She's an old peep show performer.  Billy Burr in drag.  She's the worst.  I guessed her age.  She's going to be 60 or something, but she won't admit it.  Yeah.  She does a public access television show.  She's out of her mind.  And she sings.  She takes, like, old songs and puts new words to them.  She's actually a good singer.  And she sings about, like, Jerry Seinfeld. 
[03:00:30]  She looks like she'd be a good singer.  Yeah.  And she sings.  Oh, yeah.  She made an Opie and Anthony song.  Oh, yeah.  And she also has genital warts.  And she has a huge genital wart.  Is that that girl?  Yes.  Dude, I can't.  I'll throw up, dude.  We call it twado because it reminds us of quado.  Quade.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Quade.  Come on.  From Total Recall.  I don't know if I can look at that.  You can and you will.  You have to.  I can't.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.  Open your snatch.  You can walk out of the studio. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, if you want.  If you.  You know, that's up to you.  You have one leg, you ass.  How fast am I going to get out of here?  That's the point I'm making.  No, we keep her away.  I keep.  Ooh, this whole area is off limits.  All right.  She stays over there.  But you'll see it very plain and clear even from over there.  I don't like regular genitals.  You know what her genital.  It looks like a piece of cauliflower.  Here's twado talking.  Open your mind.  That's what twado said last time.  You know what twado looks like?  Remember that article that was in the news about a couple of years ago where they grew 
[03:01:30]  that ear on the back of the mouse?  They actually grew an ear.  They were able to take some kind of tissue and mold it in the shape of an ear.  They put it on the back of a mouse, and it actually grew living tissue around this form  to form an ear.  And they're experimenting on techniques like that to replace your ear or any other part  that might have been cut off of your body.  And her wart looks just like that.  It comes off of this little stem, like a cauliflower stem. 
[03:02:00]  Out of the pubis.  Out of the pubis, and then it's got this flat shiitake mushroom type form that's on top  of it.  Can we harvest it from my ACL?  Harvest it.  You're going to love it.  I can't.  I'm going to be able to look it.  Oh, it is so utterly disgusting.  You will vomit.  All right, Derek, hit that thing.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  The O.P.  The Anthony Show.  Cold-eyed bitch.  Just a kiss on the lips.  And I was on my knees.  I'm waiting.  Give me a cold-eyed bitch.  She was shaking her hips.  So that was all I needed.  Ah, we got lots going on today.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Sandy Kane about to come into the studio. 
[03:03:00]  What about this Gamefly.com?  We should get this out of the way so we can have some more chuckles and laughs, Anthony.  What are you playing these days, Bob?  I'm playing the PSP.  Oh, sorry, sorry.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  I'm playing the PSP.  PSP?  PSP, baby.  What game you got on there?  I got Tiger Woods and the Major League Baseball.  Tiger Woods is the most addictive game I've ever played.  I play it all the time.  Online.  You hook up.  You're playing online with people like me.  I love Tiger Woods.

She apparently, I guess, was talking about us on her public access show.  Yeah.  We're trying to get audio.  She's trolling through the video.  Trying to get audio.  Looking for that audio.  And we'll put that on when...  She just waited for an hour.  Now she has disappeared.  Sandy! 
[03:06:30]  Some of our clips.  Line them up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I don't...  Oh, wow.  Wow.  She comes.  Hey, I'm a black guy.  But, uh, you know, for the black guys.  Oh, Sandy.  How are you?  Doesn't show the dirt.  Right.  What's there a dildo for?  She just likes to show...  It rotates.  And it makes her happy.  She's not going to stick anything in herself, right? 
[03:07:00]  It's Mr. Dildo.  Are you?  Yeah.  You said you were going to show us how you use that dildo, right?  Right.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Are you a fag or something?  No, dude.  I'm not a fag.  Hey, Sandy.  Do you have any...  Sandy, why don't you pull that mic up toward your face?  I don't know that dildo.  Of course we don't want to see it, Bob, but that's what makes it cool.  No, this is a very...  Because this is radio, I totally set up, Bob. 
[03:07:30]  This is high-powered.  I put it in Show World, where I used to work.  Yeah.  And the guy remembered me, so.  Remembered you?  That's kind of funny.  If you went in and bought a new dildo, he remembered you.  Right.  Yeah, he said Ben Dover.  His name was Ben.  Ben Dover.  You're just like Joan Rivers.  That's great.  Very funny.  This is Joan Rivers.  Can we talk?  She doesn't stick a vibrator in her asshole, but I have to.  Sandy, do you have any pictures of you when you were, like, in your 20s or something? 
[03:08:00]  Anything like that?  I know my brother has a video of me when I was a twirler.  What's a twirler?  I was a major twirler in my high school.  Wait, no way video of you in high school?  Yeah.  What did they call it then?  Yeah.  What was it, a bird in the camera chipping something on stone?  Did your twirler have two black cocks on the end of it?  There's no, there was no video.  Yeah, that was my first.  There's no home video when you were in high school?  Yes, there was.  No, there wasn't.  There was probably film. 
[03:08:30]  There was home videos then.  There wasn't home.  How old were you?  What year were you in high school?  Um, in the 60s.  Was it captured on the Dumont network?  Yeah.  A kinescope of her.  Dumont.  Hey, Dumont.  Are you right?  Why is, I gotta interrupt everyone here.  Why is Paris Hilton giving Tony Danza some, oh, a waxing?  Yeah.  Paris Hilton is waxing.  Look at what she isn't wearing. 
[03:09:00]  No, it'll be as painless as possible.  Yeah, I'm not.  Hey, could you stick your pussy in my face?  With all the pain.  Are you doing the whole thing?  I'm a hairy bag.  It won't be any big deal, right?  You know that.  I had my ass.  Now, how come in certain cases she has big tears?  Hold on, hold on.  Shh.  I said you look great.  This is gonna be good audio in a second here.  He's gonna scream like a girl.  No, I'm in love.  And that's why I look great.  So, congratulations.  That's great.  Is she wearing anything under that?  You know what I say to you, Anne-Marie? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  I'm shaking.  You know how sticky that was?  A little more.  Yeah, that feels good.  It feels good.  It feels good.  It's okay.  Hey, look.  I'm shaking.  I'm shaking.  Yeah.  Yeah, watch this.  I ain't worried.  I ain't worried.  Watch this.  Oh, you.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Give me a chance to catch my breath. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Are you ready?  Oh.  All right.  That's the worst.  Tony Danza getting his back waxed.  Yesterday he was in a dunk tank.  Ew.  You're supposed to breathe in and then scream when they pull?  Yeah.  And she forgot to tell me that for a whole ass cheek.  Why are you getting your ass waxed?  Why are you getting your ass waxed?  Because I have it.  Why do you think?  Because I have no idea why you have hair on my ass.  Some guy in the rest area complained? 
[03:10:30]  I had wispy.  I had some hair.  Like, not a bunch.  But I had hair on my ass.  And I'd rather have either my ass hairy or no hair.  Not just mediocre little wisps like a balding Jewish guy's head.  Wanted.  No.  But who was looking at your ass that you really were...  That's what I'm saying.  I don't even know.  Me.  Me.  You.  I don't even know what my ass looks like.  It's nice.  I couldn't even tell you if they're...  Shut up, Jimmy.  Well, I know because of my TV show.  Because I once showed my hemorrhoid on television.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to Cindy. 
[03:11:00]  He doesn't believe you have one, by the way.  No, but it was really out at that point.  And I saw a close-up.  I said, close-up on my hemorrhoid.  So they closed up.  And it was cute.  He doesn't believe you have a hemorrhoid?  Well, it might not be out right now.  You got to show it.  Well, Twato is out.  Yeah, Twato's out.  Twato's always out.  Twato's always out.  We brought Bob Kelly in here, Sandy Kane, specifically to look at Twato today.  What is a phrase?  There's two things now?  Yeah, she has a hemorrhoid.  Well, she's got a hemorrhoid.  She calls it a hemorrhoid.  But sometimes it...  And I have a pussy.  Sometimes it runs away. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, start taking your clothes off, Sandy.  Yeah, let's get undressed, baby.  Yeah.  No, because out there you can't.  It was its cover-up.  I went to the ladies' room.  Cover-up.  What a body.  Yeah.  Thank you.  For 60, she's got a nice body, though, you know?  Yeah.  Not bad, huh?  Sounds like an old folks home in here.  I know.  All right.  And you're not so hot yourself.  Not you.  Not you.  Okay.  You are hot.  Okay.  What did I say when she was outside?  I said she looks...  No, Anthony.  I said she looks good for her.  I said she looks good for her.  I said you look good for her, baby. 
[03:12:00]  He didn't say that.  He said she looked like the crib keeper with tits.  I didn't say that.  She's nice tits, right?  I wish I thought of that.  There she goes.  All right.  I just...  You know, I definitely got pasty tape this time, so...  God, your boobs are in there like mercury.  Right.  Yeah, it looks like they could spill over the top at any time, man.  They are spilling over the top.  So, that's how you make your tits look bigger.  Yeah, if you wear two bras.  If you guys want to make your dicks look bigger, wear two jockstraps.  Oh, okay.  My dick is just fine, thank you.  Is it?  Let's see. 
[03:12:30]  You're a good delivery.  Sandy hasn't seen a cock in a while, I take it.  My father was a milkman.  Yeah.  Boy, did he deliver.  My father was a milkman, really.  Really?  And then he started selling melons.  He sold watermelons and cantaloupes and honeydews.  On a wooden cart down the street?  No, on a truck and in the market.  He was a melon salesman.  So, my mother always said,  because you have big tits because you ate a lot of melons as a kid. 
[03:13:00]  All you girls out there eat melons.  Really?  Everyone else is flat-chested about me because I ate a lot of melons.  I just sold melons in the street,  but there was video when she was in high school.  Apparently, somebody sold cauliflower in your family as well.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  What's going on with the pasties?  I'm a big cauliflower heir.  I might like my tits up.  I have brought matches just in case.  What do you mean matches?  She does a match trick. 
[03:13:30]  She's old school.  She's got the pasties and everything.  It's so old, it's new.  And inverted nipples.  But she has these inverted nipples that look like holes have been drilled into her tits.  And she actually takes the match and sticks it inside the inverted nipple.  And lights them up.  Bob, what do you want to see first?  It's a hot show.  Are you out of your mind?  Show her the nipple first.  Is that a dick?  I mean, is that an umbrella or what?  This right here?  Yeah.  It's a walking stick.  That would make a good thing for my twat for my show. 
[03:14:00]  Put this in your twat?  Can I borrow it, man?  Yeah.  You don't want to borrow it.  If you're going to take it and stick it in your twat, you're keeping it.  Show him the nipple first.  Yeah.  He wants to see your nipples.  Yeah.  Yeah, show the nipple.  Okay.  So show my nipple?  Yeah.  It is like a thermometer.  I have pasties on.  So take them off.  Oh, okay.  You know, you're a really good director.  Yeah.  He gave me a breast exam last night.  Oh, Bob, you want to feel a breast?  No.  No.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I'm sure.  He had rubber gloves on.  By the way.  He had rubber gloves on.  As Sandy gets rid of her bra and stuff, you know that you weaseled your way into our 
[03:14:30]  penthouse interview?  Take the bra.  Oh.  Get the penthouse.  No, Hustler.  I mean the Hustler, right?  That's going to make the Hustler people happy.  It's the same magazine.  We've got an interview with Penthouse coming out soon, too.  Oh, those are great, man.  Great.  I'll be the first one to buy it.  Look at that.  I'm so excited.  I mean, I'm...  What do you think?  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  That's what you want to hear when a girl gets naked for you.  It's not that bad.  They move like your kneecap does now. 
[03:15:00]  Dude, they're not that bad for getting a discount at the movie theater.  I mean, those are nice.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, Robby.  Hey, Keith Richards' body, take that pasty off so we can see your nipples.  Oh.  Oh, would you like to see me light my tits up?  Yeah.  Robert, man?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, light them on fire, honey.  Why don't you turn the lights out?  It looks really good.  Okay.  All right, turn the lights off.  It'll help everybody.  Yeah.  I look better in the dark.  Hey, turn that one off over there.  Please let the winkle up.  Make me Joan of this.  Please let the winkle up.  It's for you, Jim.  It's grand treasure, man. 
[03:15:30]  Grand treasure.  Can you pull the microphone up while you're talking to it?  I love you, Mr. Sheffield Knots.  All right.  We're getting video of this, and we'll get it up on our website.  Oh, great.  She's taking wooden matches.  Yeah.  Man, you think this is easy being made?  www.sheshouldhaveinaborted.com.  People say, doesn't it hurt?  It feels good.  Here come the pasty.  Look at those awful nipples.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Hey, baby.  It's all right.  If I saw your dick, I might say the same.  I doubt it.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[03:16:00]  I don't really doubt it.  Yeah, I don't know.  You can never tell with a man how big his dick is.  Were your tits in a fire?  She sticks a match in the actual place where the nipples should be.  There's no actual...  Are you getting that weird tingly feeling in your groin area when you see something that disturbs you?  How do you have a hole where your nipples should be?  How did you do that?  Because I was meant to light my tits on fire.  God meant for me to do this.  She has a nice camel toe today. 
[03:16:30]  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Anyone have a fire extinguisher full of gas while she does this?  Wouldn't that be great to just squirt it at her and watch her go up?  How great would that be to splash gas on her right now?  Delightful, delicious, and...  Wow.  Did you have your nipples done some...  What's wrong with your nipples?  What's wrong with your nipples?  Where do you want to start?  I was left out.  They're very teeny tiny.  The worst.  So you can't even see them.  I can't even drink my coffee.  All right.  Bye, guys. 
[03:17:00]  What?  What?  All right.  That's very good.  Well, y'all like this.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  Sometimes you really feel like two pieces of meat.  Well, that's amazing.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, we want you to show...  You've got to show the hemorrhoid.  Yeah.  Turn on the lights, because we've got to make sure the area is lit up nice for Bob.  The hemorrhoid, you've got to show the hemorrhoid.  For Robert.  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun.  Robin Kelly, baby.  Ow!  Ah!  No, did we meet in the supermarket?  Showed the hemorrhoid.  Yes, we did.  In the supermarket?  Yes. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  Remember?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah, you were feeling the melons, and I said, hello.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You were by the melons.  Yeah, I remember that.  I remember that.  So, I said, hey, I've got melons here.  I'm going to shut the fuck up.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing like...  That's the latest craze?  Those panties?  Boy short panties?  Those hot pants or whatever?  They're awful.  They're just awful.  Oh.  Those pants couldn't look bad.  Those would look better on Lee J. Cobb.  All right.  Why don't we get Robert Kelly close to...  Lee J. Cobb!  Robert Kelly, you're going to have to limp over there, because you've got to get a close 
[03:18:00]  up.  What do you want?  What happened, man?  We've all looked at it.  We've all looked at it.  I've got 20-20 vision.  You don't have to touch it.  You've got to look, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to.  Robert, I'm sorry, baby, but that showbiz.  What do you...  It must be bad.  If she's apologizing about her hemorrhoid, it must be bad.  It's, uh...  It's cute.  It's really...  It's not even out today, I'm sure.  Oh, you're going to...  If I would have known, I would have had...  I would have had Mexican food.  Oh, where should Bob go?  Oh.  Huh?  Yeah, I think Bob should be to your right, Jimmy.  Dildo, man. 
[03:18:30]  Right to the right of Jimmy.  You like him, or what?  No.  Jimmy, help him with the microphone for his reaction.  Don't be a dick.  Don't be a dick, Dildo.  All right, Robert.  You like this one?  Robert.  Sweetie.  Grab that mic, that's yours now.  Jimmy's moving over there.  My protection, my bodyguard.  All right, Sandy, focus.  My side dick.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Okay, thank you.  All right, show him the hemorrhoid in the back door first.  All right.  Bend over, show him the yellow box.  Do you have any music, maybe?  Any music she could dance to?  Yeah, anything she could dance to.  I love dick.  Can you play I love dick? 
[03:19:00]  Look at the bush.  Yeah.  I love how the bush comes out the side of that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  That's Twato's side, so...  All right, don't show Twato yet.  No, not Twato yet.  No, on television, I usually, you know...  You favor the other side.  I don't like the show Twato, but on this show, it's a must.  It's a must on this show.  I mean...  Doesn't it look like Larry Fine's head?  That's great.  The pubic fucking schedule of the Yeti.  Hey, I'm warning you.  All right, we got some music for you to dance.  Hey, I got a growth on my head, Moe. 
[03:19:30]  Are you turning off the lights there, Danny?  Turn back on, Danny.  Come on, Danny.  All right, we got music for her.  Sandy came to dance to.  Okay, good.  Here we go.  All right.  All right, the music's playing.  You ready?  I'm ready.  I'm just gonna kill you.  Cure me of what?  Whatever that's wrong over there.  This will cure you.  This will cure you.  Find him, Roy.  My asshole will cure you.  What do you mean cure me?  That's whatever's wrong.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around and cure the magic, Royd.  Nice.  When you see my asshole, you'll be cured. 
[03:20:00]  You gotta bend over and open it up, though.  Yeah, you gotta spread them now.  Take a look.  Look down there.  Hold on.  Bob.  Oh, no.  Bob's throwing up.  Get him a garbage pill.  He's in the garbage.  Look, Bob.  Look up there, Bob.  Bob, look, look up.  Bob's throwing up.  He's leaving the studio.  Bob's cured.  Bob's cured.  Bob's cured.  Down goes Bob.  Down goes Bob.  Oh, man.  Oh.  His face was beat red.  Fear factor here.  We got the fear factor.  His face was beat red and he ran out of here, clutching that cane. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, Eric.  Grabbing his leg.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, Eric, you wanna take the thing of vomit with you?  Yeah, get the dude fucking out of here.  He grabs the camera and leaves.  Holy shit.  Boy, the vomit smells.  What is this?  He's beautiful.  What a man.  Oh, my God.  What a man.  You made him vomit.  What a man.  Boy, he doesn't have a strong stomach.  Holy shit.  Wait, Eric gotta follow Bob out of the studio.  Now I'm gonna need therapy on this.  Hold on.  Eric, what's going on?  Holy shit. 
[03:21:00]  I'm escorting Bob to the bathroom.  He can barely walk and he's grabbing his face.  Oh, man.  Bob.  Bob, I wanna talk to ya.  Dude, that is the nastiest asshole I've ever seen in my life.  What's the problem here?  He's got a hairy asshole, dude.  So do you, dude.  Yeah, get your headphones on so you can listen to what Robert has to say.  That's insane.  Robert.  Yeah.  What was the problem?  You puked a lot, by the way. 
[03:21:30]  Ugh.  What's the problem?  Yeah.  You alright?  Did you stop asking what the problem is?  Yeah, come back in here.  We gotta show you Twato.  I don't wanna see Twato, dude.  I don't wanna see Twato.  No, that's the, like, you're leaving after the opening act.  You don't have to see Twato.  You gotta see the headliner.  Yeah, Twato is, honestly, it's just more silly than anything.  I gotta pee.  We actually tricked you.  We tricked you and gave you the horrific one first.  Twato's just kind of just silly.  We've all done it.  Twato, alright, hang on one second. 
[03:22:00]  I'm coming back in.  Come on back in.  Alright.  Just put her clothes on.  She got her shit back on?  Um, well.  Man, just cause there was shit in my asshole, that doesn't mean...  Oh, God, dude.  What was that?  There's video.  There's video.  Sorry, I didn't wipe.  The love of God.  I didn't wipe.  Sorry.  We'll have video up on OPNAnthony.com later today.  What a shitty show now that Sandy Cain's here.  That has to go up tonight.  No, I'm just saying.  Just because I...  Alright, Robert Kelly is now hobbling back into the studio.  Alright, Bob.  Just because I didn't wash. 
[03:22:30]  Do you feel better, Bob?  Holy Jesus.  Well, I know.  Your face was so red.  Do you need one of us to hold your hand?  I don't need...  I don't need a gynecologist.  I do the O&A show.  Yeah.  Oh, you have a bevy of...  A gynecologist, man.  Alright, Robert.  Get back on the microphone.  A bevy of people...  Don't be a pussy.  Sorry, baby.  He's the worst asshole I've...  Awful.  What's wrong with my asshole?  I look like my uncles.  Well, haven't you seen your uncle's asshole?  Ah, a couple times.  What are you going to do?  Why?  He's growing up.  He's got to get money for drugs. 
[03:23:00]  I don't know.  Want to take a nice hot girl to Olive Garden?  You've got to do what you've got to do.  What are you going to do?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, that's hilarious.  Oh, God, dude.  Maybe you were fucking your uncle in the ass.  Maybe that's what it was.  Her underwear.  I can't shake her image out of my head.  Isn't that awful?  You healed my knee.  The thing I...  The knee.  No, I got her friggin' that little...  It looked...  Her panties, the front of her panties, is smaller than her pubic mat.  That matted mess in the front. 
[03:23:30]  I have a very big vagina.  It's very big here.  It really is.  I have a very well in dad family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My brother and father were very well in dad.  Don't ask how I know.  All right.  Sandy, we're going to ask you now.  Sandy.  You better get the girl out of focus.  This isn't bad, though.  No, it's not.  This isn't like a fucking...  No, no, no.  Don't talk into my fingers.  You're cute.  No.  No, it's not bad.  Why don't we get the garbage pail in here, just in case.  It's really...  All right.  We've all seen Twado and it's just kind of silly. 
[03:24:00]  What is wrong with an answer?  Like I said, it looks like an ear.  Does she have to wake it up?  No.  It just sticks right out.  At least...  Hold on, hold on.  Before you do the big reveal, Anthony, you want to explain how big this thing is again?  I guess you said it.  I guess you're right.  Yeah, it's...  About a quarter.  But it's just to the left of her area there.  Sandy, if you would...  In the pubic region.  Bob, if you would just take the camera.  Can I have a drum roll?  Yeah.  Is there a drum roll here?  No.  No.  No drum roll? 
[03:24:30]  No, we don't do those.  That's kind of hacky.  We would do it as a goof, but...  Oh, you guys...  This is really...  Are you ready, Robert?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on Fear Factor.  You will be cured again.  Really, I'm telling you.  It might take a day or two.  Is it bad?  It's good.  Turn down the music so we get the reaction here.  Some men love it.  What is it I'm looking at?  Some men love it.  A genital wart.  We think it's a genital wart.  But she says it's not.  She says it's not.  What do you think it is?  Well, um...  Have you gotten it checked out?  Show it!  Show it!  Oh, she said...  They had a doctor show. 
[03:25:00]  Hold on.  She said that...  Don't show it yet.  Hide it then, stupid.  Yeah, hide it.  She said...  Stick it out.  Does it have a name?  Dude, it sticks straight out.  It'll pop right out.  The thing is, she says that she was shaving.  She nicked herself and then this thing started growing.  It grew.  That's what happens.  That's what happens.  Yeah, and then I was...  Being a naked dancer, it's really been weird because at Show World I had to dance naked  and there was this growth on me.  So it's really been...  You know, remember the time I put a...  It's like a shape of a heart. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, she painted it red once.  Yeah, it's like a shape of a heart.  And some guy came in on Ron and Feather's show.  And nibbled on it.  And nibbled on it.  And nibbled on it.  And put it between his lips and started sucking on it.  Ugh!  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's like Paul, right?  Yeah.  Are we ready?  Like a calcium deposit, like under your grandmother's armpit, that type of thing?  Could be.  Something like that.  How do you know your grandmother's armpit?  All right.  Sandy, turn to Robert Kelly and reveal Squado.  Reveal Squado.  For the first time for Robert Kelly. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, my...  Oh!  Here we go.  Look at it!  Look at it!  It's in the ear!  Oh!  Oh, no!  Look at it!  Bob, look at it!  Look at it!  It's the nastiest fucking thing ever.  Look at it!  It's a genital wart.  What is it?  It's a big nasty genital wart.  Don't put it away!  Put it out!  Pull it out!  Pick it up a little.  Flick it!  Ah!  No!  No!  No!  There he goes!  He's freaking out!  He's got a gif out of here with a cane! 
[03:26:30]  He hobbled out like he's 80!  I'm never having this removed.  If it was a genital wart, wouldn't I be sick or something?  Wouldn't I be sick or something?  Well...  I don't know.  Okay.  I got you.  Gear factor.  Yeah, I am sick.  Who's this?  It's Eric.  He's throwing up in the toilet.  Listen, listen.  Shh. 
[03:27:00]  Shh.  Shh.  Oh, he dropped his cane!  Oh, fuck!  He dropped his cane!  Oh, fuck!  Fuck it!  It's wicked!  He really can't take this thing.  Oh, fuck!  Fuck it!  It's wicked!  He really can't take this thing.  Oh, fuck!  He really can't take this thing!  He really can't take this thing!  He really can't take this thing.  Oh, man!  Oh!  Oh, fuck!  Oh, fuck!  That is the nastiest thing I've ever seen in my life! 
[03:27:30]  Oh, shit!  Robert, what's the problem?  Oh, fuck.  That is the nastiest thing I've ever seen in my life.  All right, Bob.  What the hell is that?  It's a genital wart.  It's a genital wart.  You hearing all this?  Yeah.  God, what is that fucking thing? 
[03:28:00]  Why didn't she get that removed?  I don't know why she doesn't get it removed.  And not have a great show?  Yeah, of course.  The beautiful thing is the way the panties are right now.  No, leave it.  It's kind of the panties are resting on it, and it's sticking out of the panties.  Oh, half of it is out of the side of the panties.  Look at the hair.  It's gotten bigger, too, man.  I know.  What's wrong with Harry Bush?  You don't like Harry Bush?  You like it shaved?  There's a medium.  There's somewhere between that and shaved. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, it looks like your vag is going through chemo or something.  Oh, it's all spotty, Bob.  Spotty.  Oh, God.  Would you like a shaved Bush or Harry?  Your pussy looks like Dan Haggerty's mouth.  It's awful.  I saw her pussy on film once.  Some guy fell off a horse up in the Pacific Northwest and filmed it walking through the woods.  67.  He's saying he can't come back in.  He's coming back in.  That's what it looks like.  It looks like one of those plaster casts of a Sasquatch footprint. 
[03:29:00]  Sasquatch foot.  You have Sasquatch foot on your vag.  Well, that's why I don't shave anymore because that's what happened.  That's really what happened.  Because I just don't know.  If it was a vaginal wart, wouldn't I be sick or something?  All right, why don't you do something with a dildo today?  Oh, what were you going to do with a dildo?  Bob's got to be in here for this.  Yeah, Bob, don't tell him, though.  Don't tell Bob.  What were you going to do?  Oh, man, what a soft stomach.  Weak stomach he has. 
[03:29:30]  Well, I thought I would sing a song and stick the dildo in because I have a song called Shove It Up Me, Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's do that.  Oh, okay.  Shove it up.  I like that.  Shove it up me.  You got the music for this?  Yeah.  It's on cassette.  On a cassette.  Sandy, are you insane?  I know, I'm old.  It's the 21st century.  I know, but I haven't told you.  Compact disc.  I haven't liked cassettes.  There it is.  How long will it take, Nathaniel?  Or can you play it from in there, maybe? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  I really brought two songs for you that I did in both of my show to say thank you for coming  home, coming back.  Wait, we have audio of you talking about us on your public access show, right?  Yeah, it's great.  It's all good, I hope.  Why don't we listen to this?  And Jim Norton, too.  All right, why don't we listen to a little of this just as they cue up your song for you,  okay?  We're going to have a hot show tonight, man.  We got, you know who's on?  Opie and Anthony is on.  We got a pastor from the John Stewart Church. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, I did an Opie and Anthony show the other day, and thank you, O and A, for inspiring  this show.  I did this song on XM for Opie and Anthony.  I think it's going on television.  Yeah, she's naked.  You're naked and you move your boobs around, right?  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  Not yet.  Can we get the video of this for our website?  I would love to see the video of it.  Yeah, that is really bad.  I'm so glad O and A are back here.  On XM satellite, I showed up my ass crack.  I'm so glad Opie and Anthony are back here. 
[03:31:30]  I showed up my fucking hemorrhoid in my fucking ass crack.  Is this what public access is supposed to be to serve the public interest?  Yeah, of course.  It's not late night.  It's there just to let people go on and educate people.  Well, educate that you're back.  Okay.  Do you have a crew? 
[03:32:00]  Do you have a crew?  Of course.  And a camera guy?  Of course.  And sound people?  And a director.  And what do they think?  They just, as long as they get paid, they don't care.  Right.  I mean...  I've checked out the show.  It's kind of funny.  Yeah.  That actually does not look bad the way you're dressed.  Leave it like that.  Just don't do it the way you're dressed right now.  Look.  Is that Bobby?  Robert.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  Bobby, no.  He's going gay.  He's going gay.  He's going gay.  I'd rather suck a cock that size.  She's got her clothes on.  She's not gay.  But look at the way...  Seriously.  Yeah, just look, Robert. 
[03:32:30]  Look at the way it's sticking halfway out of the...  I'm not.  I can't see it.  Robert, someone wants to know if you puked up your pain pills.  All right.  All right.  This is what's going to happen here.  I guess we got her latest song queued up.  All right.  The one she wants to play.  Shove it up.  O and A.  All right.  O and Anthony.  All right.  Robert, watch.  And...  We're doing this for you to make you feel better about your knee.  Really?  You couldn't get...  The times you have...  Jenny Jameson, you know.  Yeah.  Sticking shit in the twats.  You're unappreciative.  Oh, really?  Yes, you are.  Triple X.  This is triple XM. 
[03:33:00]  We set this whole thing up for you.  Just the way it's sticking out of the panties.  I'm not looking at that freaking lobe.  I'll just show my pussy in a second if you...  Hey.  All right.  And then everything will stink.  You've got to take them down so you can just...  Oh, yeah.  I just feel a little shy.  Hey.  My direction.  Sit down.  You've got to take them down.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't be shy.  I just feel a little bit...  I need a little something on.  He's a little self-conscious.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, thank you.  Trust me, you can be completely...  If you take your dick out, I'll take them down.  Dude, don't.  Listen, listen. 
[03:33:30]  Just pull them down.  Take your dick out.  Trust me, no one's looking.  All right?  I swear to God.  Trust me, no one cares.  I care.  All right.  Should we start your song?  Take the dick out.  Sandy, should we start the song?  Yeah, why not?  All right, here we go.  There's a body of a 20-year-old on Jupiter.  Robert, you better be a good sport and watch the performance.  You have to, Bob.  This is for you.  It's all for you.  It's for you, Robert, baby.  You're going to be cured after this.  Here we go.  Here's the song.  Either that or kill yourself.  All right, here's the debut.  Yeah, don't kill himself.  Shh.  You got a disorder.  Oh, my God.  Shut up. 
[03:34:00]  Here's the debut of the brand-new Sandy Kane song.  Shut up!  Wait, Bob can't sing.  Oh, this is a different song, but I can...  Hold on.  Hold on.  What song is that?  This is good, though.  This is really great.  No, we're running out of show.  We want to debut the other one.  So it's the other song on there?  Well, that one's a fast one, though.  It's a really good song.  It's dedicated to you guys.  Pull your thing down.  You got your clothes on.  You can't have your clothes on for this.  Oh, man.  Can I have an orgasm on XM or what?  Yeah, you can.  You got to pull a gun for that, though.  You have to. 
[03:34:30]  You have to.  It's part of the thing.  It's part of the thing, though.  You're a naked dancer.  Come on.  I used to be.  Exactly.  Just do it.  All right.  Okay.  Oh.  It's getting...  You're running out of time.  Okay.  All right.  What are we going to do?  This is called...  This is just dedicated to you guys.  The tape that I gave you.  Sorry, Rob.  No, I'm sorry, baby.  Are you apologizing for the twaddle or the smell of deli mustard?  This is what Paula Abdul is on, painkillers. 
[03:35:00]  Paula Abdul is...  Huh?  It's a second song.  It's awful.  Unless you want to do the first song.  They can't find the other song on the tape.  Do the first song.  Yeah, but this has to be played.  Yeah.  There's a special thing that's going to happen during this song.  Oh.  That fucking OB is so easy.  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The synth phone's even cutting out on one side.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  We're trying to find the song.  Derek's having a tough time in there, and he's brilliant at what he does, man.  He was handed this cassette that is from, like, 1982. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  Hey, where's he at the pasty?  Oh, God.  I hope you find that.  It made a breakthrough.  Oh, there he is.  It can't replace these.  All right.  We're going to try something here.  Oh, you got something?  Yeah, you can't.  All right.  We're going to try this.  Here it is, Sandy Kane.  Sandy, here we go.  He's dedicated to Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite.  Right, Dildo?  Nice round of applause, sir.  Thank you. 
[03:36:00]  I'll be an anthem, shoved it up me, shoved it up me, shoved it up my hairy pussy. 
[03:36:30]  I can't sing.  Yeah, turn around to Bob.  You gotta turn around and see if nobody can get away.  Oh!  All right, we're getting the guards pilled on it.  Relax.  Wow.  Look at that, huh?  Someone can kick that dildo right into her ass.  Just keep the panties on.  Wait, you need to be on mic now so you can sing. 
[03:37:00]  I say, shove it up, shove it up me, shove it up, shove it up me, shove it up, shove it  up me, my hairy pussy, Opie and Anthony.  Pull down the pants for the big finale.  Big finale, here we go.  Oh, God.  Down, down.  Down, girl.  That just feels like a shot.  I pulled it down, you know?  I'm a rarist of a shame. 
[03:37:30]  Really, my mother's listening.  All right, my mother gets back there.  I said, shove it up, shove it up me, Jim Norton and Robert Kelly.  Shove it up, Jim Norton and Robert fucking Kelly.  She's got eyes for you, Bob.  One side to the other side.  I love you, Bob.  I know it's a thing.  Hold on the other side.  Shove it up, shove it up me. 
[03:38:00]  Look, look, look, look, look, Robert.  Oh, I'm getting hot.  Uh-oh.  Look, uh-oh.  My pussy loves you.  Oh, God.  We're going to have a gangbang here.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Bob, take a sip of water.  We're losing Robert again.  We're losing Robert.  We're losing Robert.  Shove it up my hairy pussy.  We're losing Robert.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Ben's over.  I'll shove it up you.  All right.  Very good. 
[03:38:30]  Doesn't that look like a fucking joke?  Shove it up.  Oh.  Shove it up.  He was kneeling and he just put that in his mouth.  He said it had a rubbery texture.  Yeah.  He nibbled on it.  He actually nibbled a little bit.  Robert, get back on my...  What's wrong with you?  Who wants to smell my vibrator now?  Robert was saying outside that that's one of his fetishes.  So why don't you just...  You want to smell my vibrator?  Just hand it through.  One of my fetishes, too.  Crack a fucking...  Somebody over the head with my...  Don't...  Please, honey.  Honest to God. 
[03:39:00]  For the love of God.  Keep this.  Dildo, it's nothing personal.  I know.  I know, baby.  No, I'm talking to him, baby.  He's a little...  Yeah, talk to the dildo.  He's my side dick.  Pull on the side.  Yeah, I can't see.  Pull on the side.  Pull on the side.  Yeah, Robert, just look at Twaddo one last time.  Robert, just look one more time.  What's the big deal?  One more time at Twaddo, man.  You guys are sadistic.  No, it's me.  It's a body, baby.  It's a body.  It's a body.  It's a body.  Get dental floss, wrap it around that thing, and tie it in a knot until it dies and falls  off.  Maybe I'll take your... 
[03:39:30]  I'm just saying, honey.  Look at it hanging out the side.  Look at it hanging out the side.  Robert, don't...  It hangs out the side.  Don't mention dentistry to her.  That's all right.  It's a whole nother problem.  Yeah, it's a whole nother problem.  Why?  But, yeah, we don't have to get in.  Dentists are evil people.  Yes.  See, I showed it to a dentist, and he...  What?  Anyway.  No, I didn't.  All right.  Sandy, I guess that's it for you today, huh?  Thank you.  Hey, Robert, do you have a picture, man?  Yeah.  Stand with her, Bobby.  Stand with her.  Yeah, stand with her.  She wants a picture with you.  Oh, good. 
[03:40:00]  Why don't you take a picture?  Yeah, take a picture together.  Yeah, why don't you take a picture together, Robert?  You know what, baby?  Yeah, why don't you...  Come on, bring her over.  Foreground, background things.  Now, why don't you bring her over?  There you go.  Wait, hold the dildo, too, Sam.  Yeah, hold the dildo.  Don't hold the dildo.  Hold the dildo.  What's wrong?  That's funny.  It's funny.  There you go.  There you go.  It's silly.  I like it.  There you go.  No, I'll tell you, a lot of my head could just...  Oh, my God.  You just pulled her wig off.  I'm sorry.  Hold the dildo up and swing it. 
[03:40:30]  She doesn't hold the wig.  She doesn't hold the wig, so I can swing it off.  She panicked.  Let Bobby smell that thing.  This will be on her TV show.  Oh, my God.  Honey, please don't ever fucking do that.  Please.  I feel like I'm at the Carnegie Deli right now.  He put the dildo right under his nose.  Thank you.  No, he does.  That was in a few holes today.  All right, Sandy Kane, another fine appearance by you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Sandy, how long is your hair under that?  Here?  No, no. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, it's down to here.  Your real hair?  Yeah.  Why don't you just wear your real hair?  Next time I do the show, I will.  Oh, we've seen her with the real hair.  Yeah.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, all right.  My collies match my...  No, but my hair is, like, lighter now, but...  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that's what...  Right, dildo?  Are you satisfied now?  Okay.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Sandy, let's try to get your clothes back on as quickly as possible.  Yeah, why don't we throw the dildo away at this point?  And then put Mr. Dildo away. 
[03:41:30]  All right.  Yeah, turn.  And get dressed.  There you go.  That's fantastic.  Thank you very much, Robert.  My next husband here.  Loved it.  Bob loved it.  My next husband.  You're going to be having wet dreams about me.  You know what the weird thing is?  This is what Bob was saying before.  To take that thing off, you'd have to put the whole thing in your mouth and, like, bite  it at the stem.  Oh.  You'd have to sink your teeth into that fleshy stem, and it would come off in your mouth.  He's a real...  I bet you're a good lover, Jim.  I am.  Yeah.  But, you know, you make a girl have an orgasm?  I'll never eat chicken fingers again, I swear to God. 
[03:42:00]  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  It looks like a little chicken McNugget.  Oh.  Those little shapes.  You see?  Now he likes it.  I don't like it.  Now he likes it.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  Honest to God, honey.  Dip it in some little honey mustard.  We should have a fundraiser.  A little honey mustard.  Right up between your thumb and forefinger and just pull on it until it comes out.  Oh.  By the roots.  You pull on it, and it says, the cow on the farm goes, move. 
[03:42:30]  All right, well, Sandy Cain's getting dressed.  I thought you were very much like it.  I needed this, but there are people.  Oh, yeah, we've got to thank the Hard Rock...  Shh.  We've got to thank the Hard Rock Cafe for feeding the crew today.  Where's the food?  I don't know.  It's outside.  We've been on the radio for an hour straight that we didn't get to dig into the food,  but I'm hearing there's some great food from the Hard Rock out there.  There is a police tape line around the food.  Yeah, we all want some of that food.  We've got to grab some food.  Don't.  Nobody else goes near the food.  I closed the Hard Cock Cafe.  Ah, boy, you're filming.  The Hard Cock. 
[03:43:00]  All right.  What are we doing on tomorrow's show?  Does anyone know?  Is Stephen Lynch coming in tomorrow?  Cena.  WWE is John Cena.  Oh, John Cena's coming in tomorrow from the WWE?  That'll be cool.  All right.  Well, we had fun today, didn't we, Ant?  We certainly did.  We'll have more of the psycho ex-girlfriend phone calls and other things.  Bob, thanks for coming in.  RobertKelley.com, right?  It's always funny.  Yes.  Oh, RobertKelleyLive.com.  RobertKelleyLive.com, yeah.  All right.  Anything else you want to say? 
[03:43:30]  You've got the last 15 seconds of the show there.  Yeah, hey, watch my public access show.  Go to my website.  Send me pictures of your boobs.  Shut the fuck up.  And plug, too, Sandy.  Yeah, give plug.  We'll plug at the same time.  Shut up.  No, no.  Let her plug.  Go, fast.  Shut up.  Wait, what?  Say it again.  We're running out of time.  It's over.  Everybody go home.  Speak for being a mini show. </pre>
