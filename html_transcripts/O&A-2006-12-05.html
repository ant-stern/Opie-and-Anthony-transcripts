<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from West Palm Beach, Florida, began with a nonsensical bit about a virus before transitioning to a discussion of their recent trip to a CBS Radio manager's meeting in Boca Raton.  They recounted a bizarre encounter with several general managers, one of whom graphically described masturbating while listening to a radio program featuring a woman detailing a sexual encounter. This sparked a debate about on-air language.  The bulk of the show focused on the aftermath of their disastrous eggnog drinking contest, specifically the viral "Baby Bird Video" of Pat from Menachie vomiting profusely (over 1.1 million views on Break.com). This led to Pat's expulsion from the International Federation of Competitive Eaters (IFOCE), a decision formally announced via an email from George Shea, the IFOCE head, that the hosts mocked.  A phone interview with Pat himself revealed his disappointment but also a lack of serious concern about the expulsion.  The hosts debated whether he should appeal.

The show also featured a detailed recounting of the eggnog contest fallout, including Sergeant Magoo vomiting into a beer pitcher and then consuming it mixed with Froot Loops (also a viral video).  Pat Duffy, a participant who was vomited on by Pat from Menachie, described his resulting ear infection and the media attention the incident generated.  The hosts and guests repeatedly discussed the disgusting details of the vomit with humorous commentary.  Other topics included Jim Norton's girlfriend’s reaction to his comments about his body size during sex; his ex-girlfriend’s confused reaction to hearing herself on a past broadcast; and Jim Norton's and Eric's negative experiences with a Chili's waiter.  They briefly mentioned an upcoming video contest and commented on Al Roker's weight.  Steve's unusual chest shaving technique was also discussed.

The broadcast further included discussions on a man's unusual sitting posture and his apparent weather obsession;  a caller’s experiences with "Chubby Bunny" contests, prompting plans for the show to hold its own contest with E-Rock and female participants; a retired air marshal's speculation on a potential terrorist test run;  older people's sex lives, fueled by articles about online dating among seniors and STDs in older adults; an HBO show depicting elderly sexuality; and declining SiriusXM sales, speculating on the waning "Howard Stern factor."  They also discussed their upcoming appearance on Jay Leno, contrasting it with a supposed conflict with the David Letterman show, and  bacteria levels in airplane bathrooms, with vivid descriptions of a study's findings.

A listener submitted audio bits, including an impression of Anthony and a poorly produced "Gay Howard" remix, prompted further humorous commentary.  A "Bad Joke Minute" segment with Eric featured numerous offensive jokes, heavily criticized by Opie and Anthony and online listeners.  These jokes frequently involved crude sexual humor and offensive stereotypes.  A caller, Eric from O-Town, offered more poorly received jokes.  The hosts discussed Jimmy Norton's act being performed by another comedian, Kenny, and the differences in their styles.  Another phone call involved further discussion of Pat from Menachie's IFOCE expulsion, with George Shea himself joining the call (though plagued by technical difficulties).  The show also featured a segment on the "Old Sex Ladies Blog," filled with sexually explicit anecdotes and commentary from older women, punctuated by the hosts' crude and sexually charged remarks.

The show opened another segment with a discussion about a listener's experience with Viagra and a disappointing sexual encounter, which devolved into graphic descriptions of various sexual acts.  A female caller participated in the sexually explicit and crude jokes and storytelling.  A "Line of the Day" segment featured listener-submitted jokes, many highly offensive and sexually explicit, including graphic descriptions of bodily functions, sexual acts, and animal cruelty. The winning joke was about chlamydia.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned.  The hosts thanked staff members, including Jaime from XM.  The broadcast concluded with more crude jokes and promotion of the "chubby bunny" contest, with repeated mentions of sponsors like Bodog.  The airport x-ray machine revealing genitalia and a story about imams removed from a flight were also discussed.  Joe Rogan was mentioned as having suggested the "baby bird" element of the eggnog contest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Nothing else has the power to bring a nation to its knees like the consequences of a killer epidemic.  One goes in, millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Virus.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying.  Searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill. 
[00:00:30]  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Opie. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Ha!  Ha!  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No!  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today. 
[00:01:30]  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Why bzzz? 
[00:02:00]  Because we're still here at the buzz.  Ah!  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, morning.  Live from West Palm Beach, Florida.  Jimmy goes, eck.  Tired of being on the road already.  We leave right after the show back to New York City.  Literally, literally.  Our bags are packed.  We do a radio show and then run to the airport to catch a flight to New York City. 
[00:02:30]  Where it's a lot colder, by the way.  Yeah, I'm going to miss the weather.  It's only 64 degrees right now in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Only burr.  And some local morning lady is wearing a space suit.  That's all I know.  Yeah.  Eh, local news down here is a little funny.  She was wearing, literally, it looked like a space suit.  With a Sands helmet.  She must be covering up a world of hurt.  Yeah.  And you're supposed to not notice that she's a world of hurt because she's wearing a space suit. 
[00:03:00]  A space suit.  She's got to work her way up market by market.  Something tells me, West Palm, probably not where you want to just stop your newscasting career.  I don't know, man.  It can't be bad to live in warm weather all year long, right?  Yeah, but the warm weather thing is great, believe me.  But, I don't know, you've got to have some cold in your life in order to make it, I think. 
[00:03:30]  You know, New York.  It's kind of where media, the pinnacle of the media world.  New York's not that cold.  Talk to Chicago today.  Talk to Chicago.  I understand Chicago stinks as far as its weather go.  Talk to Buffalo.  Buffalo stinks as far as its weather and a lot of other things go.  It's people, it's hotels, it's food.  It's women.  I love Buffalo.  Anyway, we had a long night last night. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  Took a little ride down a Boca.  Boca.  Which would be in the middle of the night for us to go to the manager's meeting for CBS Radio.  Yeah, that was a laugh riot.  Walked in and got attacked by general managers from all over the country.  All over the place.  Just shaking it.  Thank God they were wearing the name tags.  Yeah.  Because I don't, I don't know.  Like a couple of guys, I was like, hey, you know, hey, Paul.  And I'd shake his hand.  And he'd be like, oh, you remembered my name.  I'm like, no, you have a name tag. 
[00:04:30]  And then I just pointed his name tag.  I have no idea who you are.  I was looking around the room during the cocktail hour going, oh, wow, he fired me in Buffalo.  He fired me in Boston.  Yep.  He had something to do with my firing in New York.  She was the one that did the internal investigation in Worcester back in the day.  Yeah.  Over the mayor gag.  Over the mayor's gag.  Yeah.  And everyone welcoming us back to the company.  I'm like, well, and then I looked around again.  Well, he hated us. 
[00:05:00]  He refused to talk to us after we got fired.  He may believe he never knew us.  Yep.  It was so weird.  Really is the strangest business.  Just what other job do you go to?  You get fired from.  People hate you.  And then a couple of years later, you walk in, you get your job back, and everything's hunky-dory.  Yeah.  Just doesn't happen.  And then the story of the night, it might have to wait till XM today.  And I'm not, you know, that kind of pisses off CBS radio when we say we're going to say something for XM. 
[00:05:30]  But in this case, we have to because of the language.  But a GM from a city that will remain nameless was pretty much telling Ant and I what he thinks good radio is.  What he thinks good radio is and maybe what we should be doing a little more of to make our show better.  He would like to hear more lesbians and more hot girls because he likes to have a you-know-what on the way to work. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  He was talking about driving to work once and listening to some programming where there was some woman talking about a sexual experience.  And as he's telling us this story, he's saying that he was sitting in his car getting himself in a certain state.  A certain state and he wouldn't stop talking about how much of a state he was in and how much more of a state he kept getting in. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  And that he didn't leave his car until this certain segment was over.  Was over.  And as he was leaving his car, other people that wear suits for a living also were leaving their cars because they also had this certain state going on.  Everyone had this certain state going on.  And it was the way he was describing it. 
[00:07:00]  It was like he was standing there saying, so I'm sitting in my car listening and I'm kind of getting in this certain state.  And by certain state, he's using the vernacular we all use when you get into this certain state.  Can we say this?  He said, no, I was getting rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Just play a little word association.  Good luck.  But what Ant and I were saying, you know, yeah, guys talk.  Guys will say, hey, that girl turned me on or that girl is really hot. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, the conversation was so hot.  I mean, I was, you know, really getting turned on.  You know, you talk like that as guys, but you don't use the actual.  You don't get so descriptive to one part of your body and what is happening to it.  Right.  You don't get like, I mean, the guy was describing every nuance of the state that he was in.  That it was so goddamn creepy.  It was so creepy, Jimmy.  Was it Tom Chiesano? 
[00:08:00]  No.  Describing the stalker patty?  No.  I wish it was.  No, it was, maybe we'll blow his spot up later this morning.  Maybe later.  But it's just, so, you know, and the more she talked, the, uh, I got.  And it's like, oh, geez.  And before you know it, you know, so, and it just kept going and going.  And I'm just getting, uh, uh, and, uh, uh.  And you're like, oh, and I'm looking just, oh, stop it. 
[00:08:30]  Stop it.  That's just not how guys talk about that.  You don't talk like that.  I don't care how hot the conversation is.  You're, you're not telling us about that part.  We don't want to know about that part.  You're telling us about you and your car.  And I swear to you, I thought the story was going to end.  Well, he wanted.  With him, you know.  Taking care of himself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Finishing business.  You know that's what happened.  Because he kind of stopped short.  Because, uh, how he ended it was like, and then the bit was over.  No.  No.  You were done.  You were done. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  You know, at the, at that point when I was, you know, I was at the buffet with a foot  long frank, I really didn't want to hear it.  Could you at least put sour cream on both ends of it?  Oh, God.  Sour cream on hot dogs?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Great visual.  It's a great visual, but I'm trying to think if I'd ever eat a hot dog with sour cream on it.  The whole thing was disgusting.  The hot dog, the conversation.  But he's just sitting there, just, I was rock this. 
[00:09:30]  I was, all right.  All right.  We get it.  Enough.  You know what good radio is because, because you have like a, a meter in your pants.  It was disgusting.  He's got the, the good radio barometer in his pants.  A little gauge.  A meter.  M-E-A-T-O-R-E.  Oh, but Jimmy just over and over again, we're like, all right, enough about the, blah, blah,  blah.  Yep.  We can't really say the word over here because, because Al will get nervous and dump out. 
[00:10:00]  Don't worry, Al.  Well, it's okay, Al.  We know how to do this, Al.  So it was an hour down to Boca and, uh, and an hour back.  And they got us hotel rooms down there.  Cool.  And they, they were having this, uh, God, I will not listen the next time this stupid  company claims that, uh, you know, they can't afford this.  They can't afford to, to hire a chef while we're on the road to West Palm Beach.  They got us rooms down there?  What?  Yeah.  They, they get, actually, they gave us one room to share. 
[00:10:30]  Like, that would ever happen.  That happened once.  Back in the day.  Our first remote we've ever, we ever did.  Back in LA.  Once.  In LA.  It was our first, we had been on the radio together a week.  And they gave us, and they gave us, and that was it.  It was over after that.  Yeah.  But they gave us a, like a room, I guess.  Just in case we didn't want to drive back to the S hole we're in.  I've realized that even though it's, it's a very nice place we've, we've been in the last 
[00:11:00]  It is wonderful.  Three days.  Compared to what they're, they're staying in down there.  I'm not going to listen to the, them claiming poverty anymore with this company.  The amount of money they have to be spending on this little get together so, so they can  play golf and drink their faces off and then look for hookers in the middle of the night.  It's all the, the, the, the, the big, big brass.  Huh?  It's all the big brass.  Yeah.  So they, you know.  Flying from all over the country.  They splurge.  They splurge for themselves.  I know we met people from every, uh, every state, every day, pretty much every city in 
[00:11:30]  America are represented and yeah, they had all fly in, stay at this beautiful hotel.  Then they, they had a great food.  I felt like I was walking into a palace.  Not that I've ever walked into a palace, but it was just that massive.  The lobby was like a hundred foot ceilings and just as big as a football field practically.  And that was just the lobby of this joint.  Unbelievable.  I didn't even know it was a hotel.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah.  I just, I didn't know what it was.  It looked like some kind of a theater. 
[00:12:00]  It was just, uh, very impressive.  Yeah.  And then this is the, you know, and then the company will try to do something down the  road and go, ah, ah, we can't get you that thousand dollars for the, uh, that contest you  want to do.  What?  We'd love to, but, uh, it's just not in the budget.  How about you don't fly the guy in from Des Moines?  How many, how many Gulf streams landed, uh, in Boca?  And are they really getting anything done the next few days?  I couldn't see that.  I guess they do this every year. 
[00:12:30]  They, they pick a really nice warm place.  It's an excuse to get away and just, uh, hang out for a few days.  Do a lot of golfing.  Yeah.  They yell at you maybe in the morning over coffee and go, all right, well, you guys are  hung over like I am.  So, uh, have a nice day.  Go play golf or something.  Yeah.  I can't see them, um, you know, getting anything done after a night of, of partying like that.  Yeah.  Waking up.  What?  Seven o'clock.  All right.  Let's hit the books.  Let's go over this.  No. 
[00:13:00]  I was sitting there hitting the snooze at 10 o'clock.  Lucky bastards.  I feel bad because, uh, in radio, it's, it's a man's world, especially in, in management  because, oh my God, you know what I'm about to say?  There are, uh, uh, general managers and general sales managers from all the radio stations  across, uh, the country that CBS owns, but it has to be hundreds of stations, right?  There's only about 10 women and you, you know, they're all getting hit on right about the  time we were leaving.  It was starting to get interesting because the booze was taking, taking effect. 
[00:13:30]  These poor women.  Not many women at all.  Amazing.  Just, uh, it's a, it's a boys club.  It's a boys club.  And the guys want, you know, they want to have that, they want to talk about, yes, I was  listening and let me tell you what was happening to me.  All right.  You're a creep.  I want to hear you talking about driving your car with no hands.  It was just, it was a disturbing conversation. 
[00:14:00]  He probably had to change his suit when he got into his office.  Just a mess.  Wish the windshield wipers were on the inside.  Oh.  And then he's like, he had to tell us his age.  He goes, I'm blank, blank years old and I like to F anything that moves.  Anything that moves.  So let me tell you what good radio is.  All right.  Go ahead, psychopath.  Yeah.  Then you move on to the next person and the next person goes, you know, in my city, the,  uh, the eggnog drinking contest, uh, you know, uh, a lot of people enjoyed it and they're 
[00:14:30]  checking out the, the videos and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, uh, I didn't like it.  I don't think that went over very well.  Right.  At least with me and a couple of people I talked to.  All right.  And then you move over to the guy who's cutting up like, you know, roast beef and then you  run into another general manager.  That eggnog thing.  That's what you guys got to do more of.  That's good radio.  Holy.  Every, everywhere we walk.  So you know what we do?  We're trying to tell us what good radio is. 
[00:15:00]  We don't listen to anybody.  Just do the show we do and have done.  And that's it.  Enough.  I just bring back money snatch.  Yeah.  Money five gallon drum.  Uh, the, the, the vomit thing, the eggnog, the, uh, homeless shopping spree, all the  benchmarks, bring them back and don't care about guy who can't stop talking about his  thing.  Jimmy, have you ever described that part of your body to somebody? 
[00:15:30]  Well, you, I guess, yeah, you know what?  He's not a good example.  No, no.  Because he shows us all the time.  So that blows our whole theory.  But I guess a guy in a suit where you can, you're supposed to kind of look at as, wow,  this guy is a responsible citizen.  I'm just doing it because it's hot.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But, uh, we were just creeped out by that.  The gift bag, by the way, they did give me one.  I saw Kenny.  Yeah.  I didn't go to this stupid meeting.  Uh.  They were all asking for you, Jimmy.  That's very nice of them.  You think the company doesn't know who you are, but they were asking about you. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Very sweet.  The Chicago GM very mad at you because, uh, they had front row tickets to your comedy gigs up  there.  Oh, yeah.  It would have been canceled.  Anyway, um, the gift bag they got, um, was just amazing.  Yeah.  Uh, there is a, it's a little day planner kind of book thing, notebook, but it's also, the  cover is a calculator.  It's a notebook with a calculator and you turn it on and you can actually punch in numbers 
[00:16:30]  on the cover of your notebook.  The whole cover is a calculator.  The calculator.  So, so on the cover, the little numbers are embossed and you touch them and, uh, calculate.  What nerds.  Why would anybody want this as a gift?  But wait, there's more.  What about the wonderful, uh, the other box in there contains a wonderful card holder. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's really cool.  For, uh.  All those business cards you pick up at the big meeting.  Right.  Ugh.  Nerds.  Oh, wait.  That's a business card holder?  Not in my life.  It's not.  Sure.  Isn't it a credit card holder?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  No.  What?  It's nice, though.  It's by Tumi.  Instead of buying your luggage, they buy the smallest thing Tumi makes.  It could be either.  Cheapskates.  Chiselers.  Cheapskate.  Wow.  That's very nice.  What's the matter?  Didn't Tumi make a rubber band to put your money in? 
[00:17:30]  Creeps.  Gifts suck.  Gift bags never.  They're awful.  I hear at the Oscars they're good.  You know what?  Yeah.  Any award show, they kick ass.  And if you're a real, like, star, you walk through and they give you, like, cars.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  We get that.  And now, well, that is a lovely shirt.  The extra large golf shirt, which, it's a collared golf shirt.  It's black and it has gold and white trim around the collar. 
[00:18:00]  The neck and the sleeves.  Yeah.  And it says CBS radio.  I must say that, of course.  Why would you wear this?  Would you wear that, Jimmy?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I would never wear this.  A lovely tote bag.  Yeah, but see, these...  Tote bags stinks, too.  Enough with the CBS radio.  We get it.  Who wants to wear branding stuff all over the place?  I'd only wear that shirt if I was golfing like Michael Skakel.  Ruined family Christmas coming up. 
[00:18:30]  Other golf shirts for the big GMs from all over the country.  He yells before he swings, whore.  The big GMs, what, gay men?  They love to drink and they love to check out the female general managers from the company.  These poor women.  That's fine.  God knows what happened after we left.  All right.  We got to step aside.  We got lots to do today.  Hey, we're live in West Palm Beach.  We're going to leave for New York right after the show.  What, Jimmy?  We taking a break?  Because I want to do a little calculating and jot some notes down in my calculator notebook. 
[00:19:00]  Well, now you have one.  That's right.  Courtesy CBS.  Line up, ladies.  Calculator notebook here.  These gift bags weren't for us.  Who are they for?  The stupid GMs that will be doing calculating and golfing with the stupid collared golf shirt  and the Toomey little thing for their business card.  Every computer has the calculator right there on your desktop.  Every phone does.  Everything does. 
[00:19:30]  Every phone does.  Tampons have them in them.  Why would you need a notebook?  It's amazing that you have a calculator.  By the way, dorks.  Every year we do the list of gifts.  If you get these gifts, it means the person doesn't give a crap about you.  Let's start it out with a calculator.  You get a calculator for Christmas.  Of any form.  The person doesn't give a crap about you.  If you get a little bonsai tree, they don't give a crap about you.  The ultimate chia pet.  The chia pet gift.  You get a chia pet gift this Christmas.  The person that gave it to you doesn't give a rat's ass about you. 
[00:20:00]  Not a speck of thought went into it.  What the hell is this?  Language.  Coffee.  Oh.  Of some sort.  I thought we were getting crappuccinos today.  I caught the virus, and it sure ain't the radio show.  What do you got, sweetie?  You sick?  My throat.  Mine, too.  Is done.  Mine, too.  Done.  Let's kiss.  Because I was in that Petri dish tube with wings.  Every friggin' time we fly, there's got to be some sick son of a bitch that's on that plane. 
[00:20:30]  There ought to be screening.  Screw the weapons.  Screen people for viruses and sicknesses and keep them off the plane.  Right.  And they're all foreigners, too.  Right.  Every time you hear about some kind of outbreak, it's always someone from Guatemala that decided  to come up and ruin the bathroom.  Some unclipped idiot that's family just came in a big boxcar.  They're just leaving a bunch of bacteria all over the whole bathroom.  Forget about a smoke detector.  Get a crap detector in there. 
[00:21:00]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, we got that story.  You know what?  We could do that story today.  What do you got?  What they found on airplanes.  Coldy's and Coldy's gum.  Coldy's gum.  I'll go with the Coldy's first, then the gum later.  That's just my opinion.  And any Chulis?  Plenty of options.  And after the break, we'll do bacteria in airplane bathrooms.  Thank you.  This is why you're getting sick.  This is why we're getting sick.  Because animals.  Animals are flying.  Listen, we're just getting warmed up, but we're live in West Palm Beach, Florida.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  On the way, listen to this. 
[00:21:30]  Well, actually, right after the break, we have to talk about Pat from Wynaki.  A big scandal.  The baby bird video, by the way, from our eggnog drinking contest.  Something happened since we went off the air yesterday and this morning.  It's up to 1.1 million views on break.com.  This video is taking over the world.  And I go to Steve.  I'm like, come on, Steve.  Something's going on.  He goes, no, man.  This is legit.  People are linking to this video all over the place. 
[00:22:00]  And it's now up to 1.1 million views.  It's hit that point.  On break.com.  Now it's just run.  That's only one website.  And then other websites like GorillaMass.net and even our sites, Opie and Anthony and Foundry Music.  This video is being viewed, you know, whatever.  Use your own adjective.  It's nuts at this point.  Like?  I was going to say like crazy, but I say that all the time.  Hotcakes?  It's being viewed like hotcakes.  No. 
[00:22:30]  I think the hotcakes is something else.  And they let you off the hook.  No sour cream on hot dogs.  Well, yeah, you're right.  But that's not hot.  It's still funny.  But no sour cream on hot dogs.  Because I'm thinking throughout my whole life, did I ever have a hot dog with sour cream on it?  I kind of had to.  Viewed like a crap house rat.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, because that's like crazy like.  No.  No, no.  Viewed like an empty boat.  No. 
[00:23:00]  And now there's a website called thebabybirdvideo.com.  Wow.  It's taking over.  I'm telling you.  What's on it?  That's right.  But here is the latest because, you know, the Opie and Anthony show is all about soap operas.  Philbin, that's Pat from Menachie, shoots his last load with the IFOCE.  Which, by the way, is the international food.  What's the O?  I don't know.  Overeating Club of America. 
[00:23:30]  I don't know.  What does IFOCE mean?  The International Federation of Competitive Eaters or Eating.  I'm fat.  Yeah.  Here's the headline, and we'll get into it next.  And we'll read this press release because we don't even know if this is real.  I've got to be honest with you.  It seems a little weird.  But basically, here's the headline, and we'll get into it next.  Pat from Menachie, because of the baby bird video from the eggnog drinking contest, has been kicked out of competitive eating. 
[00:24:00]  He's a competitive eater.  Every year, for the past couple of years, he's been at the big Nathan's 4th of July hot dog eating contest.  I believe he was ranked 15th overall in the world of competitive eating.  He goes all over the place, Atlantic City, for the meatball eating contest and potato eating contest.  All these things.  And they're sanctioned by this IFOCE.  Apparently, they had a problem with what he did.  And he has been thrown out of the organization. 
[00:24:30]  And we'll get into that next, okay?  We'll read this ridiculous press release.  But they mentioned the St. Pat's incident.  They mentioned the Rob Lowe video.  Yeah, so until we get an actual spokesman from this group on here to confirm this, I'm calling a little bit of what they call Bravo Sierra.  I'm very skeptical.  We're going to get Pat from Menachie on the phone.  We'll have an interview with him.  We'll be able to tell if this is real or not.  Because I know jackasses from maybe FBA or Wackbag or one of the other sites, they love to play little jokes on us that perhaps this is one of them. 
[00:25:00]  We don't know for sure.  Now look at us.  We're speculating.  We are speculating.  As to what the message boards are up to.  See?  It works both ways.  All right.  Well, we'll get into the press release next.  It's unbelievable.  But the headline, Pat from Menachie, has been kicked out of the competitive eating club, the IFOCE, because of the baby bird video.  Poor fat bastard. 
[00:25:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Live from West Palm Beach, Florida, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is so awful.  It's just great radio.  What?  Sure.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony! 
[00:26:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Live from West Palm Beach, Florida.  All right.  We got to get into this Pat from Menachie thing.  So we did the eggnog drinking contest on Friday.  It was a huge hit this year.  Pat from Menachie set the record at 75-76.  Double shots of eggnog. 
[00:26:30]  And then Joe Rogan, who was in studio from Fear Factor, came up with this idea to do what's now called the baby bird thanks to Than.  We had Pat Duffy, who's now an intern on this fine radio show starting in January.  Lean over a big, huge garbage pail.  He bent over backwards.  Yeah, he was like, lean back like you're, like you lean back to get your hair washed before a haircut.  And then Pat just unloaded bucket after bucket after bucket after a bucket of eggnog. 
[00:27:00]  And, of course, everyone's talking about the video.  Well, yeah, I'll clear it up, too.  Not out of buckets.  No, no, of course.  It was out of his stomach.  Yeah, of course.  He was just...  He vomited all over this guy's face.  I've never seen anyone puke more in my life.  Never.  Fire hosed him.  And, like I said, it's on break.com.  It's up to 1.1 million views.  And to be honest with you, we were going to start to move on from the eggnog drinking contest. 
[00:27:30]  We really were.  And all of a sudden, we're on our way to Boca, and our emails and our phones start going nuts.  And we got word that Pat from Menachie, because of the eggnog drinking contest and because he did this baby bird video, he got kicked out of the IFOCE.  See, I thought, like, competitive eating was just a goof.  I really thought it was just a goof.  Yeah, like anybody goes up, signs up for it.  They, you know, pick a few people.  You go up, and you shove a bunch of hot dogs in your face. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  And aren't they puking during these contests, by the way?  Yes, some people lose it.  But they don't make a big deal about it again?  They don't put the camera on them when it happens.  Right.  On a televised event.  So they keep that behind.  Yeah, they don't want that to be part of it.  They want the eating to be part of it, not the getting rid of it.  Right.  Yeah.  I know.  It's distracting, too.  Jim, Steve with his tank top and his freshly shaved where his chest hair meets his neck hair. 
[00:28:30]  Looks like two different torsos put together.  Smooth arms, like monkey chest.  Monkey chest.  Make me sick.  Here, Steve.  Yeah.  Love you, Steve.  So we're trying to get to the bottom of this.  So you got an email from Pat from Menachie?  Yeah, I just got the email that Pat was sent last night from the, I guess he's the commissioner of the IFOCE.  There's a commissioner.  Yeah.  Charles Hardy? 
[00:29:00]  Ew.  What is it?  Well, this guy is George Shea.  Oh, George Shea.  This is the guy that I spoke to the night of that, the St. Patrick's Day thing when we were going to do that egg eating competition.  Right.  And he stepped in and said, well, if you're going to do a competitive eating competition with our eaters, it's got to be sanctioned, and we need to get paid, and we need this fee, and we need these people on the staff.  That's not what it's about.  Yeah, this guy's like the Don King of competitive eating, apparently.  And I spent a half hour getting on the phone, getting schooled by this guy as to the rules of competitive eating, which I had really no idea about. 
[00:29:30]  Now, let me ask you something.  Was he serious when you were talking to him?  Quite.  Because this press release we're about to read is filled with, like, goofs.  Yeah.  Silly things.  Yeah, he was dead serious.  This is a, you know, they look at it as a sport.  And if you're going to have these guys competing in these eating contests, it's got to be, you know, you've got to have certain things in place. 
[00:30:00]  You've got to pay your fees.  You have to have certain people on hand to, you know, to monitor the whole thing.  But.  No, no, I'm listening to you.  So, yeah, so this is the email that Pat got from George last night, dismissing him from the organization.  And can I say, I'm reading this.  Yeah.  And George Shea, who is, I guess, whatever he does, this guy, he's so awful.  I'm reading this email.  He's like a parody of a jerk off.  Yeah.  The fact that this ass thinks this nonsense, this nonsense is a real thing. 
[00:30:30]  That has any type of dignity that needs to be protected.  The fact that this ass thinks that competitive eaters are somehow viable athletes or men to be taken seriously.  You are a boob, George.  You're a bunch of gluttonous scumbags who shove hot dogs down their throats so we can laugh at you. 
[00:31:00]  That's right.  That's what you do.  But somewhere along the line, they've decided to turn this into a serious sport.  A sport where they call the competitors, yeah, athletes.  Yeah.  It has to be sanctioned.  What do you win?  A gold colon?  Yeah, their trophies are pretty ridiculous.  What a bunch of dopes.  So, Steve, what is the email from Pat?  This is the email that Pat got last night.  This is the email that Pat got last night from George Shea.  And this is real.  This is not some guy being ironic. 
[00:31:30]  No, this is real.  This is...  If someone said you're going to be in a movie, be a jerk-off, this is what you'd do.  Pat, it is with great sadness that I must inform you that via edict by the IFOCE commissioner,  you are hereby expelled from the IFOCE for conduct unbecoming an eater.  Or and eater, sorry.  For unbecoming conduct unbecoming an eater.  Like Jimmy said, they're a bunch of gluttons.  Conduct unbecoming an eater.  What did he do?  Show restraint?  Have one ounce of self-esteem? 
[00:32:00]  You apparently got laid when you were a teenager.  That's conduct unbecoming an eater.  You douche.  A recent video in which you purposely engage in an...  Oof.  Efluvik?  Efluvik.  Efluvik.  Thank you, Keith.  What is that?  Efluvik.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  I've never seen that word.  No one has ever seen Efluvik.  Efluvik interchange with another individual breaches the IFOCE code of conduct in numerous  ways, and the IFOCE cannot condone this behavior by including you in its ranks. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, don't ever engage in an Efluvik interchange.  Well, can we look up Fluvik, please?  No, it's Efluvik.  I got lost coming here because I took the Efluvik interchange, and I was supposed to wait  and make the next break.  Actually, you might have to take tomorrow off because I think you've got some Efluvik in  you.  Efluvik.  I can't believe she got pregnant.  She had a refluviks tied.  This George isn't supposed to happen.  This guy is a boob squared.  What's the rest of the email? 
[00:33:00]  You are now delisted from the IFOCE rankings, and you are no longer qualified to participate  in IFOCE events or to call yourself a Major League Eater.  And this is why George Shea is a dope.  He capitalized the M, the L, and the E in Major League Eater like it's baseball or football.  Exactly.  You jackass.  It's a bunch of fat guys and a few soulless Asians shoving hot dogs into their face in  a gang-infested dump in New York.  Pony Island is a slum. 
[00:33:30]  It's a slum, George.  A bunch of fat pigs eating in a slum.  Just trying to fill up the sadness inside themselves.  It's the only thing that gets people to that god-awful boardwalk.  Right.  It's just competitive eating and riff.  It's either it's gang activity or fat people shoving hot dogs with water.  How do you eat hot dogs like that?  George, you are an ass.  The IFOCE cannot condone it.  Really?  Can't it? 
[00:34:00]  These slum.  These slum behaviors are not tolerated.  He's slum.  He's slum.  Wait till we read this part of the whole story.  But again, is that the other one?  One more sentence.  This unfortunate incident has sullied your reputation and besmirched the honor of all  eaters.  Do you know, besmirched, Jeffrey Dahmer is an eater.  Hitler was an eater.  He's smirched.  Oh, he has sullied his reputation.  And all the dignity you have, you know, when you're dipping buns and hot dogs in water. 
[00:34:30]  When you're eating pig intestines that have been tubed off and dipping them in water.  You know, all the dignity that brings you and your family.  How could you sully that?  Nonetheless, I wish you Godspeed and good luck in your endeavors.  Yours sincerely, George Shea.  Godspeed.  How fast can you go?  You've just eaten.  You're a fatso.  Fat pigs.  Well, the comments are coming in here.  On the instant feedback, we got Stephen S. from Bayshore.  I think the reason they threw Pat out was because he claimed to have a girlfriend. 
[00:35:00]  That would make him the first competitive eater in history.  Oh, no, an update.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  In history, to make the bold and unusual move.  Wow.  Do we know what effluvic means yet?  Well, I would think it's some type of fluid transfer, right?  Bodily fluid.  Well, he, uh, the family looked up effluvial.  Oh, okay.  Um, number one, a usually invisible emanation of exhalation as a vapor or gas, a byproduct 
[00:35:30]  or residue, waste.  Ah.  Which covers all of them.  The odorous fumes given off by waste or decaying matter.  An impalpable emanation and aura.  Uh, wow.  He effluvic.  He went deep for that word.  We learned today.  Of course.  All right.  Uh, I would love to get to, um, this, um.  So where was this posted, Anthony?  Do we know?  Uh, this is on a, uh, some type of IFOCE fan site. 
[00:36:00]  It had to be.  It should have been on, it should have been on doesn'tusecommas.com.  Yeah, I know.  What an idiot.  How about a paragraph?  Uh, Philbin shoots his last load with the IFOCE is the title.  And, uh, it goes on.  Pat from Munaki, the most colorful and controversial figure ever to don the IFOCE stripes,  had his brief but entertaining competitive eating career cut short after puking up what 
[00:36:30]  appeared to be a tidal wave worth of eggnog over a willing but demented participant.  George Shea and the IFOCE went on record as saying that this conduct goes down as one  of the most deplorable and disgusting acts ever performed on another human being.  And you can see it on break.com.  So that, that covers, uh, what happened in concentration camps. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, right, right.  What serial killers did to their victims.  And I'll tell you one thing, George.  I, I can, I have to correct you.  My hard drive says there's a lot worse.  Yeah, exactly.  By the way.  Oh, well, he did say human beings.  You know.  Wait for the, wait for the quote from the Bible.  It's coming up.  Yeah.  As Anthony continues.  Ew.  Yeah.  If Opie and Anthony were banned from radio for having, uh, sex performed in St. Patrick's  Cathedral, but then he has the wrong type of sex.  He has like above, above the waist. 
[00:37:30]  And if we say what type of sex, ow, he's going to have to dump out.  Well, he has above the waist type of sex, uh, quoted here.  And that never happened.  Well, it.  Just stop it.  Yeah, you could, uh, well, yeah.  Uh, then they should be permanently banned from this planet.  We should be banned from the planet, Opie.  For, uh, coercing Pat Philbin to perform such a despicable act.  How about this?  How about most of the competitive eaters be banned from this planet?  Or at least the uncles that molested them and caused them to need to fill this void. 
[00:38:00]  How about they be banned?  They shoved food down their throat.  Yeah, whoever touched you when you, whoever fumbled with you.  Yeah.  Commissioner Charles Hardy handed down the final verdict around 11 a.m. Eastern Time on December 4th, 2006.  A day that will live in infamy.  That's what it says here.  A day that will live in infamy.  Hardy had this to say, and I quote,  I gave him plenty of rope and he used it all.  I warned him not once but twice to lay off the eggnog, S-H, and then some blank lettering goes on there. 
[00:38:30]  A little salty language.  And he ignored my demands.  Heaving on another human being can cause serious repercussions such as AIDS or other communicable diseases.  What?  What?  What?  What?  All this time?  I didn't know it was that easy to do.  Yeah.  I could have just thrown up on people.  Hey, I don't mean to interrupt really, really fast.  Competitiveeatingnews.com has more dandy quotes someone is letting us know. 
[00:39:00]  Cody from Dallas, thanks for the heads up.  Hey, do you have to join that site?  Because I think that maybe a lot of our fans would have things to say.  What's the website on there?  Oh, the ONA pests are going to have a ball the next couple of days.  Competitiveeatingnews.com?  Yeah.  Let's go there.  I remember when Arthur Ashe puked all over Mr. Brady.  Are you looking for something, or shall I continue?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Yeah, I'm good. 
[00:39:30]  It goes on.  Pat Philbin is the first ever member of the IFOCE to receive what appears to be a permanent  ban from the IFOCE.  Shockwaves have triggered all over the eating community.  Shockwaves have triggered all over the eating community?  That's from them walking.  Yeah, as well as the sponsors that run ONA, including the infamous Wack Bag Crew and Foundry  Music.  What?  They're sponsors, you ill-informed idiots?  This guy's an idiot.  Eatsfeats.com, known as the hangout of the competitive eating list, was flooded with so 
[00:40:00]  many Pat from Wunaki comments regarding his termination that OJ Rifkin, OJ Rifkin had  to close comments for an hour because the wires were so backed up?  Is this a real press release?  The wires were so backed up?  What is this, a switchboard in 1860?  You don't understand this.  OJ Rifkin doesn't take any bunk.  OJ Rifkin. 
[00:40:30]  Sounds like a name of a whack bagger.  It's OJ is a killer, and Joel Rifkin is a killer.  There isn't an OJ Rifkin.  This is such a goof.  We're not buying this statement.  We've got to find out what's real and what's not real.  This is a post, by the way.  An hour, because the wires were so backed up.  Yeah.  Philbin had always considered ONA his bread and butter, even though they never paid him  a dime for his services. 
[00:41:00]  However, he has become sort of a cult figure, gaining immense popularity amongst the degenerates  of radio, making frequent appearances on the show while being mocked and ridiculed  in almost every appearance.  They've gone as far as poking fun at his diabetes, his skin condition, and his missing toe.  Commish Hardy will admit he is not an ONA fan.  Philbin had words with Opie this past March after they attempted to get Badlands Booker 
[00:41:30]  to participate in an egg-eating contest.  But, of course, we realized that that was Steve.  Yeah, I never talked to the guy.  And Opie sounds like a homosexual.  Easy.  Philbin is scheduled to be a possible guest on BB Corner's Christmas special coming up  in a few weeks.  Badlands Booker, I guess, Christmas special in a few weeks.  We'll certainly have a huge fan base ready to call in and voice their opinions regarding  his ban from competitive eating.  Many people thought that Pat's career as an eater always played second fiddle to his stints 
[00:42:00]  on ONA.  But there are reports that Philbin is quite upset and is yet to be reached for comment.  It appears that X-mas came early as the IFOCE handed him a Christmas present he will never  forget.  By the way, this is not the press release that we were reading yesterday in the car  down to Boca.  It's not a press release.  This is somebody's statement that they made on a blog or a message board. 
[00:42:30]  Where's the one where they were quoting from the Bible?  Yeah, where's that one?  It was on all our BlackBerrys.  Can we find that?  By the way, Pat's career as an eater, this is not a career.  It's not.  It's just disgusting indulgence.  If you go to WhackBag, I think that was on the first post on WhackBag.  Somebody couldn't paste that.  That's the one we really want.  Can we find that?  All right.  On the phone, Anthony, is Pat from Menachie.  Oh, thank God.  His first statement.  This is breaking news.  We'll find out what's real and what's not real after we step aside for a minute or two 
[00:43:00]  here, okay?  All right.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, live from West Palm Beach.  It's just those guys having fun again.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, live from West Palm Beach, Florida.  62 degrees down here. 
[00:43:30]  Cloudy.  We got a lot of controversy this morning.  Pat from Menachie has been kicked out of the IFOCE, if you're just tuning in.  Can you believe it?  Because of our eggnog drinking contest and because he did the baby bird to end the whole  competition this year.  And IFOCE, I guess, what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  They're taking themselves way too seriously? 
[00:44:00]  Apparently so.  The fact they capitalized Major League and Eater shows that they really think that they're  an organization that is of the same ilk as Major League Baseball or the National Football  League.  Right.  Yeah.  They're not.  Well, it's competitive eating.  That's what Pat did when he wasn't, you know, coming on our show or delivering packages  in his crappy van.  He did this.  It was all he had, by the way.  This is all he had.  And here's what they do.  Once a year at Coney Island, that slum that Jimmy was talking about. 
[00:44:30]  It's not once a year anymore.  I mean, well, that is, but they have...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just saying once a year, 4th of July.  That's like the Super Bowl.  They have that, right.  Okay.  And that is what is televised.  That's the only thing.  And it's a goof thing.  Like, they televise it and the commentators, like, goof on it.  And it's a joke.  But all year round, they're all over the country, I guess the world, eating other things.  Meatballs.  Right.  Pig's Knuckles. 
[00:45:00]  Calamari.  Yeah.  Whatever they could shove down their gullets.  Pretty much they have a record for every food now.  Yeah.  For every lobs.  Potatoes.  Because when the competitors come up for the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, he set the  record for whatever, hard-boiled eggs.  Yeah, hard-boiled eggs.  And room temperature.  But no one ever hears about this.  No one knows about it except for their own little group.  Right.  The only thing that gets any press is the Coney Island hot dog eating thing. 
[00:45:30]  And they think everyone knows about their organization.  No one even knows that that organization puts on that thing.  They think it's just something that happens at Coney Island.  Yep.  I thought Coney Island.  Yeah, I thought Coney Island or Nathan's.  Nathan's.  I thought Nathan's put it on every year.  Nathan's put it on.  They're just a big sponsor, I guess, right?  So they have this organization, the IFOCE, the International Federation of Competitive Eaters.  And Pat was, he joined because he wanted to be at the 4th of July thing at Nathan's. 
[00:46:00]  He qualified.  He got in.  He didn't do very well, but he was in it.  But he has a ranking as far as he's got a ranking.  Or used to, as far as the IFOCE goes.  Right.  So anyway, what's the breaking news?  Pat from Manaki expelled from IFOCE.  This is an official piece of news, right?  Oh, yes.  This is breaking news right from the, what website is this from, Steve? 
[00:46:30]  CompetitiveEatingNews.com.  CompetitiveEatingNews.com.  All right.  Where all competitive eaters or fans of competitive eating can go for all the news they need.  There are no fans of competitive eating.  Of course there aren't.  No one is, no one is going, like, wants to join the mailing list and, like, wants to get the, they don't have cards.  No.  I have a fantasy league based on it.  The greatest enemy of competitive eating is the stomach stapling.  And self-esteem. 
[00:47:00]  Well, here's what this one says.  Okay.  Breaking news.  Pat from Manaki expelled from IFOCE.  Sources report that Pat Philbin, a.k.a. Pat from Manaki, has been expelled from the IFOCE for conduct unbecoming an eater.  While Commissioner Charles Hardy would not discuss the issue, many believe it was prompted by the recent video in which Manaki,  they call him Manaki, like, that's his name, in which the entire town of Manaki engaged in an effluvic, effluvic, effluvic, effluvic interchange with another individual. 
[00:47:30]  In a portion of an email message obtained by CEN, IFOCE chair George Shea said, quote,  You are now delisted from the IFOCE rankings, and you are no longer qualified to participate in IFOCE events or to call yourself a major league eater. 
[00:48:00]  This unfortunate incident has sullied your reputation and besmirched the honor of all eaters.  Nonetheless, I wish you godspeed and good luck in your endeavors.  Yours sincerely, George Shea, reached at IFOCE headquarters.  Headquarters?  Is it headquarters?  Yeah, it's a Burger King in Ronkonkoma.  Pigs.  George Shea also refused to comment on the expulsion.  He offered, however, this in this time of trial. 
[00:48:30]  Pat may want to turn to 2 Corinthians, wherein he may find guidance from Paul's discourse.  On Suffering Fools Gladly.  This is the latest in a long stint.  String.  String, excuse me.  Of celebrity video scandals that dates all the way back to Rob Lowe's 1988 video,  Indiscretions with two women in Atlanta at the Democratic National Convention.  So this is the last in this line of video celebrities. 
[00:49:00]  Celebrities.  They called him Mr. Munaki.  You know, I think, obviously, his organization, you know, doesn't take themselves too seriously.  But the fact remains, they kicked poor Pat from Munaki out of the IFOCE.  He loved that competitive eating crap.  And without further ado, well, we got the echo.  Without further ado, let's get some echo, echo, echo.  Now eating.  Let me see if this works.  Pat from Munaki.  Number zero. 
[00:49:30]  All of them.  Tap.  Here he is.  Okay, we got him.  Hi, Pat.  Yes, Pat from Munaki is now on our phone.  Yesterday it was, hi, guys.  Now it's...  I'm feeling a little...  Pardon my voice.  I'm feeling a little stressed these days.  Oh, has stress gotten your voice all screwy?  I think so.  Were you weeping all night or something?  Maybe a couple tears slipped out.  How's your girlfriend? 
[00:50:00]  Fluid, fluid.  Fluid.  How's your girlfriend?  She's just fine.  Oh, good.  How do you feel about being booted out, Pat?  Booted.  I don't feel good.  One thing I wanted to point out, I was never warned not to do the eggnog drinking contest.  All I was told at the last egg challenge I did for Clerks 2, he told me, next time, let 
[00:50:30]  us know before you do it.  That's all they ever told me.  That's funny that you're asking.  That's just going to be his argument in front of the commission.  Look, no one ever told me not to vomit into the mouth of another man.  So this is real.  This is real, Pat.  You're definitely kicked out, right?  You lost your ranking.  You were ranked one in the world.  Yeah, I originally was 10th in the world, and then the last few contests I kind of tanked  in, so I dropped to 20.  They just re-ranked me at 24, and then I just checked the website, and I'm not even in the  ranking. 
[00:51:00]  Let me tell you something, Pat.  I'm happy they booted you.  It's the best thing for you.  Enough of the food obsession.  You want to work on this chick.  You like this girl.  You got to let this part of your life go anyway.  Enough with the competitive eating.  Your whole life doesn't have to revolve around food.  You've done it.  Screw this dumb organization.  They're capitalizing on your addiction.  It was his life.  No, it wasn't his life.  It was better for you, Pat.  I'm in the competitive eating, and it looks like the eggnog contest will get me out of  competitive eating. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, boy, Pat.  Short career.  How has the last 24 hours gone for you?  Getting a lot of phone calls, a lot of support.  What's going on?  A lot of press.  Give us a feel of the world of Pat from Minaki.  Oh, yeah, everybody's.  My phone messages have filled up.  I haven't been able to check any of them.  Stomach.  Yeah, I've been able to check it.  He never had to.  He never got one before.  Yeah, that's right.  He's got one in it. 
[00:52:00]  Every time he checks.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Pat.  Great press ready on the battle lines, willing to fight my battle for me.  Yeah, if we didn't think this was so despicable, the organization, we would try to get you  back in.  I'm still trying.  I'm still mulling this over, thinking, should we try to appeal this and get him back in,  or is it in his best interest to just find another hobby?  Yeah.  Isn't the IFOCE all about getting publicity?  They really love publicity? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, they're a marketing company, so that's what they're all about.  So maybe they're getting some discussions here, and maybe they'll bring you back into  the organization in a week or so.  Maybe.  Oh, yeah.  People have been reinstated.  So maybe they get a little publicity from this whole event, from the Baby Bird video,  and then they invite you back in, and then there'll be just another wave of publicity  for the IFOCE.  It's a growing sport, and I liked it. 
[00:53:00]  It's your call.  It really doesn't...  I've actually lost weight.  Listen to me.  Oh.  Listen to me.  First, A, it's not a sport, and B, you don't lose weight by being in a compulsive,  overeating organization.  Maybe because you don't eat properly.  You should be happy to be out of this dumb thing, and eat better, and you want this girl,  so get on with things.  You've done this already.  It was fun.  Just move on.  I say you move on, and you work on getting the chick, and even if you don't get her, 
[00:53:30]  you get another chick.  Like Mother once said, you put down one thing, and you pick up another.  Mother.  I think you're better off, Pat.  It's bad for you to be shoving hot dogs into your face to your vomit.  But this is all he had.  No, it's not.  Pat, this is all you had, right?  You have nine toes.  Oh, he says he's got nothing now.  Hey, Pat, what do you want the pets to do?  They're standing by.  You want them to write emails?  What do you want them to do?  Well, I don't mind them voicing their opinion.  I wouldn't really attack, but voicing your opinion, serious emails only. 
[00:54:00]  You still have hope.  You know what serious emails only mean on our show, by the way?  She knows.  What's that?  You do know what serious emails only means on our radio show, right?  It's a code word.  As far as I know, it means serious emails only.  No, it means screw with them to no end.  It's a code word.  It's a code, you ass.  It's like Torah, Torah, Torah. 
[00:54:30]  What do you want them to do?  Yeah, just express their opinion, and maybe that'll do me some good.  All right, where do they go to express their opinion?  There's ifoce.com.  Okay.  That's George Shea, Shea Communications.  And you'll see all the contact information there.  And there's a message board, eatfeats.com. 
[00:55:00]  Eatfeats.feats, F-E-A-T.  Not like, you know, eatfeats.  Pat, hold on.  Pat, hold on.  Eatfeats, E-A-T-F-E-A-T-S.com.  Right.  Not like what diabetes is doing to his feet.  Hey, Pat, have you seen the video on break.com?  Oh, yes.  My favorite one's the one where you see Anthony losing his stuff there. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, there's a lot of different versions of this.  We had a lot of cameras in the studio.  It's like the Puker film.  Yeah.  There's one version on break.com.  It's up to 1.1 million views, Pat.  You don't need this IFOCE anymore.  You're a star, Pat.  You're a star because of that video.  Well, it's a new day in the world of...  You're on the I-P-U-C-K.  Right, right.  All right, Pat.  I say that even if they try to reinstate you, you tell that guy to go jump in the lake until 
[00:56:00]  he stops using the word effluvic.  Tell him you won't be a part of any organization where the man uses effluvic.  Effluvic.  Did you know that there was a code of conduct?  And where is this code of conduct?  It's somewhere.  I don't know where.  He's the one out.  Well, I'll give you a good example.  They had a turkey challenge last year.  Yeah.  Where I was moving around and I was throwing turkey on my head.  Right, I remember that. 
[00:56:30]  They didn't invite me back and the guy on Channel 11 News was saying,  where's Pat from Unaki?  We need him.  Because nobody else would throw turkey on their head.  Yeah, you put the turkey on your head and it was really funny.  Yeah.  Pat with turkey on his head.  Yeah, and they're trying to have this kind of dignity.  Well, you're madcap antics, Pat.  There's no place for them in the IFOCE.  Yeah.  Turkey on the head.  Yeah, I see.  What's that?  Right. 
[00:57:00]  You're like the guy that does too much of the victory dance in the end zone, you know?  Yep.  Yeah.  You're a showboater.  All those guys are jerks.  Showboater.  Hey, are there any progress with the girl?  No, we just spend time together.  Everything's wonderful.  Have you told her you love her again?  Yeah, yesterday and I'm saying it today, too.  Every day.  Every day.  Is she helping you through this tough time?  Yes, she's consoling me. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I think we've got to let you go.  I think CNN's going to be calling any second, so.  Ooh.  Poor Pat.  Is the media calling you, Pat?  Are they knocking down your trailer door?  Yeah, the phone keeps beeping.  There's people on the other line.  Yeah, yeah.  People are telling me I've got to go.  Hold on a minute.  We've got Pat Duffy on the line.  Pat.  Baby bird.  Pat. 
[00:58:00]  Baby bird.  Can we get both of them in here?  Where's Pat Duffy?  Hold on, Pat Duff.  Pat Duffy.  What's up?  There you are.  Okay.  Ooh, baby bird.  What's up, boys?  What's going on, Pat Duffy?  Nothing, man.  I want to apologize for my mama bird.  Yeah, well, Pat Duffy was on the receiving.  Yeah, he was on the.  You hungry?  I am.  Oh, Pat.  Yeah, Pat was on the receiving end.  Pat Duffy was. 
[00:58:30]  Pat from Munaki's big puke.  Puke fest.  Puke fest is puking.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  Hey, Pat Duffy, question for you.  Would you ever do puke stuff again for our radio show?  More than anything in the world.  He's the great.  I absolutely do it.  I don't think he could ever top it, so I say retire.  No.  Sometimes you got to just retire when you hit the top.  What?  I think Pat Duffy's found his forte.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy rules.  Pat, has your life changed?  I'm talking about my forte. 
[00:59:00]  Pat Duffy, has your life changed since Friday?  Walk us through your world.  It's been ridiculous.  Like, everybody's been calling me.  It's just been crazy.  Like, I'm known as the puke guy now.  It's crazy.  He's the puke guy now.  I've had about over 150 MySpace requests.  It's just crazy.  Yeah.  You're Pat Duffy on MySpace.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Can I give it out again?  Yeah.  MySpace.com slash all-purpose cleaner.  Oh, that's right.  All-purpose cleaner.  All-purpose cleaner. 
[00:59:30]  That's Pat Duffy's MySpace.  The better I feel about myself.  When did your ear clear?  Because we found out later in the day that your ear was clogged from Pat from Menocki's puke.  I'll tell you what.  Every time my ear pops still, it, like, cracks and hurts a little bit.  Oh.  And I've had a nasty cough all weekend.  It's like if he's got an ear infection or not, because eggnog keeps dripping out.  Ew.  You got an ear infection, and you're sick from Pat from Menocki's puke. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Whatever Pat had, you now have.  Yeah.  Did you swallow any of that?  Yeah.  The first shot I swallowed, the rest of it I just spit out like a good one.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  It's just a natural reaction to swallow it.  And Pat Duffy, of course, you've seen the video on Break.com, right?  About a hundred times, yeah.  Yeah.  Something happened overnight, by the way.  This video has taken on a life of its own.  We were at about a half million hits after the show yesterday. 
[01:00:30]  This morning, as we sit here, it's over 1.1 million views on Break.com alone.  That's awesome.  That's amazing.  My ex-girlfriend actually called me up crying, telling me that it wasn't me, and she didn't  even know who I was anymore.  Not only was it you, but that's the same mouth you've kissed her with.  This is true.  Pat Duffy, that made you a rock star.  Don't you worry.  It's awesome.  I can't even believe it.  Overnight internet sensation.  Hey, listen, bro, my first big hit on the O&A show was getting arrested and going to 
[01:01:00]  jail for being on a bus with a bunch of naked girls.  I mean, it's the odd stuff that helps you, bro.  It's the weird little stuff.  That's right.  Well, that's my next step, though.  All right.  Good boy.  Anything else, guys?  That's it.  Pat from Anaki?  I just want to say I'm sorry to Pat.  I feel really bad, and I feel 50% responsible.  That's all right, baby.  You let me know when you're hungry again.  All right, I will.  Oh, yuck.  Yuck.  You know we'll do that in front of thousands of people someday.  Well, yeah.  Maybe at the O&A Traveling Virus next summer. 
[01:01:30]  Or maybe somebody throws up at a store and somebody eats it.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right, Pat Duffy.  Thank you, sir.  No problem, boys.  I'll talk to you later.  We'll see you in January when you start your internship, all right?  I can't wait.  All right.  Bye, Pat.  Oh, Pat.  Bye, Pat.  Ugh, get a cold.  And there goes Pat from Anaki.  He got sick, and he's got an earache.  Yeah.  By the way, that's another reason we might be sick.  Me and Anthony have both got sore throats because of all the germs in that room from  the puke.  That were floating around?  Yeah.  No. 
[01:02:00]  There's not germs floating around in your room.  Oh, my God.  Any people puke?  Yeah, there was 30, 10, 12 people vomited.  Why didn't anyone else get sick?  I think it was that damn airplane.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Steve is sick.  Every time I'm on an airplane.  Steve, you're sick?  Yes.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  You've been struck with the shaven arms syndrome.  I knew that was coming back.  Yes, you have arm AIDS.  Arm cancer.  I'm getting chemo in my arms, my shoulders and my forearms.  It's just nare. 
[01:02:30]  I hate that perfect line.  If you don't see Steve, he looks like he's wearing a tank top over a monkey sweater.  Why don't you just shave it a little unevenly so it looks natural?  You know what it looks like?  It looks like body armor.  Yeah.  Like you shaved body armor into your chest.  I was trying to make it look, you know, I was trying to, I didn't want to shave my chest  because I don't like the way I look when I shave my chest.  And you like the way you look that way?  No, I really didn't want to run out of shirts, but I ran out of clean shirts.  This was the only clean thing I had left.  Everything else was dirty.  Steve is hairy from head to toe. 
[01:03:00]  Yep.  Your chest hair definitely meets up with your beard.  Yeah, it does.  I have to shave.  So you have to shave in between to make it look, show people where the chest actually begins.  Yeah.  There's actually a line right here and then I nared everything else.  You truly are a bear.  How do you do your back?  Do you shave it or does Jane Goodall help you?  Yes.  I have help.  I'm in the midst.  They're checking you out on Pal Talk right now.  Oh, lovely.  All right, listen, why don't we relive the baby bird moments from the eggnog drinking contest. 
[01:03:30]  This is how it went down on Friday.  Maybe not.  Oh, Opie.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 77.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  It's happening.  The baby bird is happening.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, my God.  No way.  No way.  No way.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, my God.  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you.  I'm laughing so hard.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard.  He ran into the corner.  Oh, yeah.  A thunderous round of applause.  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface. 
[01:05:00]  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to top that.  It's impossible.  I can listen to that another ten times.  It's just an amazing moment.  The build, the slow build, the wave after wave that happened.  Oh, it was just disgusting to watch.  And the amount, the sheer amount that came out of him.  You know, that's our hit record, obviously.  All the videos from the eggnog drinking contest are up on opiananthony.com. 
[01:05:30]  But break.com has decided to throw up a second video from the eggnog drinking contest.  Yeah, that one's really hard to watch.  This is kind of like they're going for a follow-up hit.  I mean, the hit is the baby bird video.  But break.com is like, man, this thing is getting so much attention.  You know, let's throw up another clip from the eggnog drinking contest.  And that would be the clip of Sergeant Magoo puking into a beer pitcher.  And then pouring it over some Froot Loops.  And then he proceeds to eat the Froot Loops. 
[01:06:00]  See, the Pat from Unaki one, the baby bird, the comedy of it.  That transcends how disgusting it is.  Yeah.  You almost forget that it's vomit.  Because it's so funny to watch somebody getting sprayed in the face like that.  The pitcher full of eggnog vomit that Sergeant Magoo used to fill up in a bowl and put Froot Loops in.  Oh, my God.  And then eat. 
[01:06:30]  It's so hard to watch.  I can't watch it.  And we thought that would be the highlight of the eggnog drinking contest.  I cannot watch it.  I kept thinking things were the highlight as we were going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, that's the highlight.  Oh, no, that's the highlight.  No, no.  Yeah, and it ended with the baby bird.  But break.com, thank you.  It's on the front page.  Sergeant Magoo filling up the beer pitcher with puke and then pouring it over the Froot Loops.  And then proceeding to eat the Froot Loops.  And then other people, I guess, eating the Froot Loops.  And then the clip ends with E-Rock just puking.  They're trying for a follow-up hit.  Wow, it's up to 20,000 hits. 
[01:07:00]  It's only been up there a couple hours so far.  You can't take for granted that that's not – people are going to watch that.  That's awful.  Yeah.  No one's not watching a man vomit and eat Froot Loops out of it.  We're acting like it's old hat.  It's all old hat to us.  Or the old Froot Loops and your own vomit trick.  It's pretty cool that you can downplay that video because you have the baby bird video fresh in your mind, you know?  I think it's a wonderful follow-up.  So you think we got a second hit on our hands?  Maybe not at the same size, but it's still a great one.  Yeah.  I mean, God Almighty, I mean, why can't you have two great songs on the same album? 
[01:07:30]  That's what I'm hoping for.  That's what we're hoping for.  You think the police have one good song?  No.  No!  With the thriller?  What did they say about Billie Jean?  Oh, forget Beat It!  All right, hold on a minute.  All right, well, go to break.com.  It's on the front page.  I think that's...  They're both vile, but the thick...  I mean, even though it's his own vomit, the thick, stringy, mucousy texture of the vomit. 
[01:08:00]  The longer it sat in that beer pitcher, the thicker, lumpier, and more coagulated.  Oh, dude.  And, like, it got sour.  Yeah.  It separated.  Oh, yeah, it just started getting...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was clotting as we went.  Would you suck down one mouthful of that for 20 bucks, Ant?  20 bucks?  20?  I'm in.  I can't ask, Ant. 
[01:08:30]  20 bucks.  20 bucks?  Yeah, why not?  Hey, here's the audio from that fine moment.  Dude.  Talking to Magoo, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling a little queasy.  All right.  Well...  How many...  Shot, shot, shot.  There we go.  Another one.  What are we up to?  Chit-chat.  All right, guys, this is the 25th double shot of eggnog in the eggnog drinking contest.  Magoo, put that one right down.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  He's puking into the pitcher. 
[01:09:00]  And now you can measure it.  Oh, my God.  He's going to fill it.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Oh, it's getting chunky.  Look at the guy turning his back.  He doesn't want to see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  A little spittle.  He's filling up the pitcher.  He's filling up the pitcher.  Pitcher's full. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, my God.  That almost made me puke.  He filled...  Completely filled up a huge beer pitcher.  All right.  Yeah, we're back live here in West Palm Beach.  Oh, is that hard to listen to?  That one's a tough one to listen to.  That is...  Here's what that is.  It's reprehensible.  It's reprehensible.  He is really bringing that up from just a deep, dark place.  Magoo is just fantastic.  He's a champ. 
[01:10:00]  So then we had the pitcher sitting on the table, and like you said, it was getting thicker as  the morning went on.  Yeah, it was going sour.  Like oatmeal.  And this was one of...  Oh.  This is a really fast clip.  Then there's Pat Duffy with one of his many highlights from that morning.  Yeah.  This is what he did before the baby bird.  Hey, would somebody take...  Now, that pitcher is so awful.  Would somebody take a sip out of it?  Like without the Froot Loops, just a sip, just a nice, thick, yogurty sip.  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:10:30]  Oh!  Eric rocks down.  He rocks down.  He rocks down again.  Wait, we've got to explain, because it's just noise for people out there.  The intern took a big, mouthful sip out of Magoo's pitcher of thick, viscous-y vomit.  He took a Viking swig.  Pass up.  A Viking swig.  And it spilt over his cheeks and chin, ran down his shirt, and splattered on the floor.  Oh, was that... 
[01:11:00]  See, I forget about that, too.  See, that is way grosser than the baby bird.  He grabbed it.  Like, you ever see your buddy grab a pitcher of beer at the bar?  A stein of beer.  And he just grabs it and starts chugging out of it?  Yeah.  That's what he did with Sergeant Magoo's thick, chunky vomit.  And he couldn't...  He tipped it back so fast, thinking it was liquidy.  And it went in his mouth, but a lot of it went out the sides and tumbled down his cheeks,  beard, and again, right on the floor.  And there you go. 
[01:11:30]  That's going to be the follow-up hit to the baby bird video.  That is up right now on Break.com on the front page.  You can check out the video of what you just heard.  Have fun.  That is revolting.  It really is, man.  My stomach doesn't get turned easily.  I've watched beheading videos without getting nauseous.  They're upsetting, but they're not...  Yeah.  This is revolting.  Yeah.  Revolting.  All right.  Well, that was it.  The end of Pat's career.  Oh, God.  There you go.  All right.  We're going to move on.  We got Norton's ex calling your phone with some weirdness.  Just nuts. 
[01:12:00]  Really?  I heard the audio.  It's hilarious.  We'll get into that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, live from West Palm Beach.  It is an endless cycle of fiddling, and nothing is getting accomplished.  Just let this show die.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!

[01:13:30]  Al Roker is gaining his weight back.  What was that you that said?  Hi, Anthony.  You see ya?  I'm so happy.  Keep eating, fat boy.  Yep.  He lost a bunch of weight.  His head looked like one of the California raisins.  And now he's gaining it back.  See, Steve C., I saw yesterday, I was going out with my girlfriend for a walk on the beach,  and we walked by.  Young Steve coming out of the gymnasium after his hour-long workout.  Steve got the stapling, now he works out.  And aside from that stupid chest shaving, he looks good.  Well, a lot of these guys, they eat themselves through the operation. 
[01:14:00]  They get the operation, and then they slowly but surely, you know,  they didn't take care of the problem why they're over-eating,  so they eventually stretch out their stomach or what's left of their stomach again.  All the operation does is kill the capacity.  It doesn't kill the addiction.  So you have to figure out what's going on in your head before, you know,  and hopefully it'll all balance out, or you're just going to gain the weight back.  You'll just retrain yourself to eat ice cream and gain all the weight back.  Cool.  We should go on the circuit and speak.  Thank you.  Good luck with that.  You're right.  Shut up.  But no, how I did it by Steve C. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  Thank you, Jim.  All right.  We're doing it.  How to shave to look like a thin man.  Yes.  Whenever I wanted to lose weight, I would shave my arms and take off 11 pounds immediately.  You are one of the hairiest guys we've ever seen, Steve.  I know.  One of the hairiest mammals I've ever seen.  That's why I shave it all.  It's pretty unbelievable.  I donate it to primates going through chemo.  I have the body hair consistency of a rodent. 
[01:15:00]  I'm a small night feeder.  All right.  That's what you look like.  You have the body hair of a shrew.  A shrew.  What is a shrew?  Exactly.  Thank you.  It's a little, like, rodent thing.  It's a little night mammal.  It's tiny, though, and hairy.  Just picture what's on your bathroom floor after you shave with eyes and a tail.  There it is.  There it is. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, Jimmy, speaking of the girlfriend, girlfriend update?  Back to frolicking on the beach?  We did some frolicking.  We had our talk.  Aw.  You want to, like, maybe bring everyone on board from yesterday's conversation?  Well, yesterday, my girlfriend and I had had a conversation the night where I became convinced  I convinced she would be happier if I was a bigger boy.  I said to her, you'd like me more if it was bigger.  And she's like, what are you talking about?  And she didn't give me an answer, so I was thinking she didn't want to hurt my feelings 
[01:16:00]  because she likes the way I'm built and blah, blah, blah.  But if I was bigger, she'd be more satisfied.  And this was after a night of passion?  Great sex.  Between you two?  Yeah.  Right.  Best ever, I'm hearing.  Well, that was what she said.  Best ever.  It was an amazing experience for her.  She might just have to be polite.  But you couldn't accept that as just being that.  You had to think that she had a problem with, you know, your size. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  So I asked her, and I talked to her yesterday, like two days ago this happened.  I talked to her yesterday.  And she said the reason she didn't answer me right away was the reason she – because  I'm like, you just don't want to tell me the truth.  I'm like, you just don't want to hurt my feelings.  I didn't say tell me the truth.  And she's like, well, no.  So I'm like, oh, my God.  The answer is no, she's not happy with it, and she just doesn't want to ruin my self-esteem.  So I was devastated.  Devastated.  And then I talked to her, and she's like, no, the reason I didn't – I asked you, like,  what are you doing here is because you talk so much during sex, such weird stuff. 
[01:17:00]  I didn't know if this was part of your sex talk.  And so, like –  Oh, God.  Because the other night she had said to me, like, I don't want to hear things about me that you wish was different or different on other women.  Meaning, like, she wouldn't like to hear that in bed.  Meaning, like, why would you want me to tell you something about you that I don't think is good enough in bed sexually?  She didn't know if I meant for real or being sexual because she asked me that in the moment.  She's like, why are you doing this?  Like, what's the reason for this conversation?  So I thought she meant – am I being clear or no? 
[01:17:30]  Yes, you are.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  I'm thinking she means she doesn't want to hurt me when the reality was she was saying, like, I don't want to kind of go there talking sexually because it doesn't –  wouldn't do anything for me to talk about your body parts not being good enough.  Right.  And so we had fantastic sex yesterday.  Wow.  We made up.  We frolicked on the beach.  We both got massages.  She got a facial.  Oh, yeah?  Then she went down to the place.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  You know, give me those ribs, everyone.  Waka, waka.  Now, she got a facial downstairs.  We had a really, really good time and we were very loving.  Oh, that's sweet.  So you're back to normal, right?  See, I knew it.  Just a little bump in the road there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Just a tiny little pothole.  I'm crazy.  She knows I'm crazy.  You are nuts.  We had a nice talk.  I apologize.  We're all nuts, though.  It's all on me and I knew it was on me.  And I told her why I did it because I'm psycho.  So now you understand the whole situation?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  Hey, speaking of girlfriends, so your ex called you? 
[01:18:30]  Got a call yesterday from my ex right after the show.  Can we make it perfectly clear?  I love Jimmy's ex.  I do, too.  She's very funny.  And Jimmy loves his ex because she is nuts.  She's truly crazy.  She's the only ex I'm friends with.  She's actually a real friend.  I mean, I don't see her that often anymore, but she is nuts.  And you know you're nuts if you're listening.  Erin.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Know how they met.  She came in studio because Jimmy wanted to smack a girl in the face real hard.  Right.  Yeah.  And she was like, yeah, I'm up for that.  I'm up for just about anything. 
[01:19:00]  No, I was driving around New York.  Maybe she was in studio for something else, flashing or something.  And I hear over the radio, you go, Jim Norton, if you're listening, we have a girl for you.  Come in studio.  Oh, okay.  So I drove in.  This is when I was real new on the show.  And I was doing like two or three days a week.  And she's like she wanted to be slapped in the face for sexual purposes.  And you bet I complied.  And there's audio of me slapping her in the face.  Yeah.  And that night we went on our first date.  She came to the comedy cell to watch my show.  She borrowed 20 bucks to go out and cop drugs. 
[01:19:30]  That was Jimmy's first date with her.  I'm like, all right, well, I won't be seeing her again.  She comes back an hour later.  I'm like, what happened?  She's like, well, I got robbed at Knife Point in Washington Square Park.  So I'm like, fair enough.  So then I dropped her off.  She didn't tell me where she lived.  She made me drop her off two blocks from her house so I wouldn't know where she lived.  This is all going well.  Yeah.  And then I, you know, I showed her what a good boy I can be.  Yeah, in the car.  There was love there.  Yeah.  For a while.  Jimmy's like, wow, man, this girl's for me.  Yeah, we dated for a year. 
[01:20:00]  And the fact that she's a loon and I'm a loon didn't help.  Well, you broke up because you never found time for her.  Yeah, it was one of our complaints.  We talked about that on the air.  Like you were too busy doing your stand-up night after night after night.  And she just wanted you to take a day or two every once in a while and go do something  with her.  And she was too busy being obsessive-compulsive and a complete psycho.  I mean, we all have our own process together.  I understand.  Like, she wasn't the one to bring to a bed and breakfast.  She probably would enjoy that, actually, because there's not people for her to say awful things  around.  The more people around, the more chances of a major problem occurring. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  I saw her not long ago.  She came to the Comedy Cellar and I was being heckled by a family.  And she was sitting there and this guy and his stupid wife and his daughter were heckling  me.  And she started yelling at the family.  Nice.  Yeah, she's great.  She was yelling at the daughter.  She's like, go back to Jersey as they're walking out.  And the girl's like, we're not from Jersey.  And my ex goes, yeah, but your hair is.  Oh, she smashed him.  She's really vicious.  We love her, man.  She's a good ex.  I got a call from her.  She called your phone? 
[01:21:00]  No, I got a text message from her.  She called me and she goes, why is somebody, there's a girl on the air right now calling  you Muffin.  That's my nickname for you.  Why is somebody stealing my nickname for you and using it on the radio?  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Yeah, what?  She's like, someone, there's a girl on there talking right now about suing a boyfriend  and taking him to court and he's, she's using your nickname, my nickname for you.  She's calling you Muffin.  Why?  She was furious.  And I'm like, I can't, I couldn't hear her, but I'm like, you idiot, that's probably 
[01:21:30]  you.  It's probably an ex that replay.  A replay?  She's like, it's not me.  I know my own voice.  Five minutes later, I get a text.  Oh my God, it's me.  What an ass.  And I text her back, I know it is, you effing maniac.  And then she texts back, I was so, with a bunch of, I was so mad.  I'm like, it's you.  She was mad at herself.  She was mad listening to herself.  Thinking it was somebody else. 
[01:22:00]  Not knowing it was herself.  She had no idea, even in the context of the story.  And I guess she heard her name mentioned and then realized it was her.  Isn't she the greatest?  You know, I know a lot of people hear themselves on, on the air and it doesn't sound like them.  That's, that's fine.  But the story itself, the story itself has to be familiar.  Yeah.  You got to think.  On some level.  Wow.  You know, uh, that kind of sounds familiar.  That's not.  And then she, she, out of the whole story and what happened, she picks a nick, a little  nickname that she called you. 
[01:22:30]  That's what she remembered.  But she didn't remember that it was her.  She thought she knew it was her, but she didn't know it was her that said it.  She thought there was some other awful girl calling me Muffin.  And it just annoyed her that someone had stolen that nickname and used it.  So we got a couple of voicemails here.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Just the text.  Who said voicemail?  Oh.  That's a misunderstanding.  No voicemail.  What is this?  That's just the audio.  Oh, no, we don't need, that's what I was saying.  We didn't need that.  No, it was just a text.  This is the audio of what?  From what she heard that made her.  Oh, she heard this.  Oh, okay.  Every break, you have to take a leak drinking so much water and coffee and what have you. 
[01:23:00]  And all of a sudden, Aaron came stumbling into the men's room because she needed to take a leak.  And why not do it in the men's room, right?  What?  Yes.  Muffin likes to watch.  Muffin.  Did you just watch her take a leak?  Yeah.  No, he likes to watch me.  Yeah, I know.  I just, that's why I asked the...  Muffin?  Is that what you're calling her?  Yeah.  Cute.  A little muffin.  All right, so we replayed that yesterday.  Yes.  And she thought that was another girl calling you Muffin.  Oh, someone was calling me Muffin.  And it just annoyed her that someone stole that nickname because she probably figured they heard her say it. 
[01:23:30]  I'm going to call you Muffin now.  As you should.  Everyone calls me Muffin.  You can call me what you want.  Just don't call me late for dinner.  Get out of here, clubby.  All right, I guess we don't have to play the next one.  No, no, no, no.  It was just a momentary aside of just what, that's what my life is.  Having my new girlfriend convince me that my genitals are acceptable and my ex-girlfriend thinks that somebody is calling me Muffin and then she realizes, oh, it's me. 
[01:24:00]  That's what I deal with in my life.  Any of you that think you have problems.  The only bigger ass than my ex-girlfriend is me.  Yes.  Wow, that's rough.  And Eric sent me an interesting one.  I don't know if, can I mention this on the air, Hawk?  It was an interesting one you sent me.  I didn't know it was you.  Is that acceptable to mention or no?  Yeah, just mention it.  Well, I have to ask him.  I respect his privacy, if not his ability in radio.  Do you want to read what you sent me?  Because this is a little, will you two stop candoodling? 
[01:24:30]  Steve and Eric can't stop touching each other.  It's annoying me, just a couple of men who just can't keep their dirty little hands off each other.  This is the page I got, the text from Eric yesterday, but I didn't know it was him.  Yeah, it said, Jim, if you get a chance later, I got to tell you about going to Chili's today and my girlfriend almost getting denied drinks and how this stupid waiter acted throughout the meal.  Okay, so he sent me this.  I didn't know what was going on.  So you went to Chili's and you have a story to tell about your experience and you had it text Jimmy. 
[01:25:00]  He texted me with it, yes.  But I didn't recognize it was him because I didn't have his name entered.  Oh.  But now I entered it.  Did he tell you or do you know what it is?  Yeah, it was actually, that's why I'm bringing it up because I figured you want to tell the story on the air, but I didn't want to tell him.  So what happened at Chili's with Iraq and his girl?  All right, so we get there and the waiter, he's like 18, he starts IDing us for drinks and he's looking at her license and saying, this isn't you, this isn't you.  And she's getting all upset and saying, yes, it's me. 
[01:25:30]  How is this not me?  And then he looks at her and he says, okay, this is you, but this isn't your age.  So she starts screaming at him like, how is this not my age?  Finally, he doesn't want to deal with it.  He gets us drinks.  He comes over after every time he brought something to the table, he's doing like that waiter in Office Space in that Tchotchkes movie.  He interlocks his hands.  He's doing, that's awesome, with two double thumbs up or snapping the fingers and pointing at you.  Just all these stupid little, like, hey, guys, have a good time, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:26:00]  And it was just driving us nuts.  We were just thinking Jimmy would lose it on this guy.  Hey, Club Story Kenny, did any fans show up today?  We had a couple outside, didn't we?  Yeah, it's the usual suspects.  Another fine collection of dullards.  A few guys?  Yeah.  One's worse than next.  Oh, my God.  How uncomfortable are you, E-Roc? 
[01:26:30]  Dude.  He told me the story, too.  Yeah, he did.  With all the hand motions.  Let me tell you something.  When I heard that, I'm going to see if this text puts me over in text and I get charged extra, you're paying me back for the time.  Out of principle, you're paying me back.  On that awful story, I wanted to throw hot coffee on him.  Not that it was bad just to mention in conversations, but the fact that he texted me, like, Jim, sit down first. 
[01:27:00]  Does anybody remember last day?  Well, Stephen, from Bayshore, he writes, change E-Roc's name to Z-Z-Z-Z-Rock.  That could be the worst story ever.  It really is a story with no...  It's not even a bad story.  Okay.  It's just nothing.  It's a vacuum of a story.  It's just a block of your life that you have to lose when listening to it. 
[01:27:30]  Like, for instance, this is something that's on par with that story.  Yes.  My girlfriend and I called room service yesterday, and I wanted to get potatoes, but she wasn't sure if she wanted vegetables, so she wound up getting the vegetables, I got the potatoes, and normally we'd split something like that.  Here's my story.  Get back to the hotel room, and I got to get to sleep, but I like having water next to the bed, and I didn't have any, so I had to wait to call room service so they could bring the water up so I could have it next to my bed. 
[01:28:00]  When I slept, and the guy that came up and brought it was, like, really jovial and happy, and it was just, like, it was driving me nuts that he was so happy to just be bringing water.  That's just terrific.  You want to hear my story?  Yeah, sure.  After the show, me and Keith went to lunch.  I had a hamburger.  He had a chicken panini sandwich. 
[01:28:30]  You rock?  Here we go.  Got one?  Right now, Eric, your story is fourth on the list.  Club Soda is his first because we just did so much mystery involved.  Anthony's second because he's got the sexy I'm in bed angle.  Bill from Waterford, if that E-Rock story included a recreation of the baby bird, it still would be the worst story ever.  He texted me with that, like, Jim, remind me.  Please remind me.  You're working on a show idea? 
[01:29:00]  Here's episode one.  Oh, hey, Lauren, that story would suck if it ended in everybody being shot at the restaurant.  That couldn't be a good story.  It would still stink.  There's no way that story, and then she looked out the window, and we saw the Hindenburg crashing.  That would have made the Hindenburg story uneventful.  That story needed a ta-da!  It was awful, but not even awful like bad.  It was awful in the sense that there's just something missing. 
[01:29:30]  There's no substance to it.  Exactly.  All right, come back strong.  Give us one of your screams.  Off mic, though.  Come on, Hawk.  Off mic.  We love the E-Rock scream.  He screams until he runs out of air.  It's just terrific.  By the way, as he gets ready, changing gears a little bit, London, Ontario, Laurie writes,  Sorry I'm late.  Took this long to get to my computer.  A lady died at our county fair this year in a marshmallow-eating contest.  How would you like to tell that to your grandkids?  I want to see if that story's true. 
[01:30:00]  How would I, incidentally, to answer your question, I'd love to.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right, E-Rock?  Good.  It's the E-Rock scream, everyone.  Ah!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, live from West Palm Beach, the home of E-Rock's parents  and a lot of repressed memories.  We used to play, put the spider in the bikini. 
[01:30:30]  And I'd tell you to a spider in your bikini, you'd pull off your bikini shorts.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  Oh, hey!  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerate shopping for Christmas presents. 
[01:31:00]  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless  shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bye!  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:31:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show live from West Palm Beach, Florida.  We fly to New York right after the show.  And we're looking out this fine window here where it has been sunny and bright.  And, boy, that changes quickly.  It is just dark clouds.  I see some lightning. 
[01:32:00]  It's looking a little grim.  And look who's happy.  A big smile.  The only person happy in the room is Club Soda Kenny.  He can't wait to check the website and just do something.  Here's how you talk to Kenny when you go, how are you tomorrow?  He'll go, I'm really good with a chance of showers.  Yeah, he's already called the airline.  Yeah.  We're on theweatherchannel.com right now.  Of course, that is.  Why wouldn't we be?  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  And, Kenny, you can see out the window.  What does that look like?  It doesn't look promising.  But, you know, the Florida weather moves, like, really quick.  Yeah.  Are you trying to be an optimist on us?  I know.  What is he doing?  Yeah.  I don't know.  What's protocol, though?  You see these dark clouds coming in.  What are you going to do now?  We're checking out.  And theweatherchannel.com says cloudy63. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, those are clouds.  That's right.  Yeah.  So they got about as much information as I do.  They're horrid clouds.  They're dark clouds with lightning in them.  Well, you know, CBS could have flown you guys out earlier.  I talked to them.  Yeah, Kenny, that's what we're getting at.  Kenny, stop looking at the weather.  We don't need a weather forecast.  We're looking out the window.  This is what we're saying to you today.  You see the dark clouds coming in.  So now what?  Do you call the airlines?  You've got a whole thing you usually do with your OCD.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's a little too early.  It's only 8 o'clock. 
[01:33:30]  All right?  Maybe by another hour, two hours, I'll start to panic.  You'll start worrying about it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But as long as there's no, like, lightning in the air, we should be good.  Yeah?  Lightning, they shut the airport.  Oh, is that it?  Yes, they do.  Okay.  Those guys, those guys that load the baggage and everything can't be out there if they  get hit by lightning.  Oh, that's why they close the airport?  I think.  Yeah, the planes can't.  I think.  First of all, I don't like the fact that he just shut me down with authority. 
[01:34:00]  Yes, they do.  Why?  Because the baggage guys are going to shock.  And then, I think.  Really?  I don't think so.  Ew.  I think.  What are you talking about?  Can't believe I just bought into his acting.  Yeah, no kidding.  No, because if you say something with authority, people believe me.  It worked.  I tried it.  It didn't work.  I would assume airports probably have some of the best lightning prevention equipment.  Bar none.  Yeah.  I would assume. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, no, they probably got good stuff.  Hey, speaking of airports, thanks, Kenny.  Good stuff.  All right.  What's up with this x-ray thing?  You were a little worried about this x-ray thing this morning.  It popped up a while ago, but it's kind of making a resurgence.  Weapons, they want to run people through these x-ray machines.  And weapons show up really clearly in these things.  But so does the rest of you.  You kind of show up like a marshmallow figure. 
[01:35:00]  Very white.  And the weapons show up very dark on you.  So you can see a gun if someone's hiding it, explosives, anything.  But you could see your junk.  And you could see women's, you know.  Boobies.  Boobies.  It looks like you're walking through this thing naked in a very overexposed kind of negative.  But you can see very clearly your private areas. 
[01:35:30]  So they had a picture of a guy there on Drudge Report.  On the Drudge Report.  And you saw a gun.  But you also saw his junk.  So I'm just thinking how embarrassing that would be to walk through.  Because now you've got to try to, you know, present yourself a little better.  You've got to maybe, before you walk through, kind of maybe get your girl.  Maybe get yourself to kind of work it.  They should have fluffers at the airport, perhaps, to cut down on the embarrassment factor. 
[01:36:00]  Would you really be bothered by it?  I could care less.  You could care less.  I think if you're hung like an acorn, then you're like, oh, God.  But there are some times you are.  And then sometimes, you know, you're of the proportions you're supposed to be.  And then sometimes you're well above.  Depends on your mood, the temperature, your nerves.  A lot of people get nervous at the airport.  Security, that whole thing gets them a little nervous. 
[01:36:30]  And there could be some shrinkage.  And you don't think they're going to save some of these pictures and go, yeah, look at this guy.  Look at this.  Look at this pathetic mess.  But they can't match it up with you because you don't know what the person really looks like after he's gone.  I don't know.  Critics, including the ACLU, of course, say the machine can display graphic images of nude bodies and its use will pave the way.  Once again, a bunch of douchebags and the slippery slope argument will pave the way to widespread abuse of the images taken with some possibly being posted or traded onto it. 
[01:37:00]  We have penises.  Sorry.  It's a part of our bodies.  Women have vaginas and breasts.  So what?  I would rather have somebody see my wiener than be blown up on a plane at 30,000 feet.  God, are we that uptight?  Are we that uptight about our genitals that we're afraid someone's going to see an image of them? 
[01:37:30]  And first of all, who is posting this x-ray crap when you can get anything you want pornographically?  You can download Paris Hilton and somebody's going to want the penis of a man who went through an airport screening?  You might have a special fetish, Jimmy.  I don't know.  You're into x-ray photos.  But you can't identify by faces.  No, no.  That's ridiculous.  If we're going to prevent people from smuggling or, God forbid, a C4 eventually being inside, I don't know.  I don't mind if they see my little dingle.  And while we're on the subject of airport security, we were driving down to Boca last night. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And Anthony was watching Hennedy and Combs on his little phone.  Just a terrific little piece of gadgetry.  Oh, I love it.  You were doing that.  Just like Fox News.  And I was playing GTA Vice City Story.  You've got to stay entertained.  I didn't feel like knowing what's going on in the world.  So much into Hennedy and Combs.  And they're doing a story on these five imams.  Imams.  Yeah.  Imams.  Whatever they are.  Whatever they are.  Clerics.  These highly religious Muslim peoples that apparently a while back got in a bit of trouble. 
[01:38:30]  They were praying before they were boarding a plane.  So they're in the airport.  They pull their rugs out.  And they face Mecca.  And they start praying.  And they were denied the flight.  They were pulled off the plane because passengers were nervous.  Good.  Then they start this whole thing where they're going to sue.  Blah, blah, blah.  Their rights were infringed upon.  Now the police report came out.  They pulled out the rugs where? 
[01:39:00]  At the airport.  Right at the airport.  Right at the airport.  Before they boarded the plane.  They did this.  You know where you're sitting in your seats waiting at the gate?  Right.  They pull their rugs out.  Where you're waiting at the gate and you're looking around going, uh.  Yeah.  Which one?  Yeah.  All right.  This isn't a bad crew.  I think we're going to be all right.  Everyone looks suspicious.  Yeah.  Right.  They pull out their rugs.  Five guys pull out their rugs.  And that's pretty much what the news printed.  They want to make that perfect.  That's crazy, man.  That's what the news printed.  Now, here's what the police report has in it.  And here's a few more details that weren't printed in the news. 
[01:39:30]  Of course.  Five guys, one bag between all of them.  All of them one-way tickets.  Don't know where it was to, but all of them just one-way tickets.  Maybe they were going on a mancation.  Mancation.  Yeah, mancation.  So, uh, one of them has a ticket for first class.  The rest don't.  So they all board with the first class guy.  And then distribute themselves around the entire aircraft. 
[01:40:00]  Then they ask for seatbelt extensions.  Where none of them need seatbelt extensions.  They're not fat.  You know, fat people need the seatbelt.  So now they got what amounts to a nunchuck.  It's a strap with a heavy belt on the end of it.  Some type of weapon.  You could choke someone out with that easily.  Choke someone out.  Easily.  Put it this way.  You have just a little bit more than everyone else has now to swing around and do this.  Regardless now if it was all innocent or not, there are enough red flags going up in this 
[01:40:30]  situation that five passengers, separate passengers, alerted the pilot, some of the flight crew.  The pilot then came out, talked to these people.  And it's his decision.  It's his ship.  He makes the final decision.  No, I don't want them on the plane.  And the whole cabin started applauding as these men were stood up and taken off the aircraft.  Apparently also during their prayer, they were heard by multiple passengers saying down with 
[01:41:00]  America, saying positive Saddam Hussein things along with their prayers that they're entitled  to be able to do at the airport or wherever the hell they want to.  It just, enough red flags there popped up.  Like, you'd have to be an idiot to sit there, watch this happening, and not say something. 
[01:41:30]  I don't believe those guys.  I think they were doing something to have a lawsuit.  Hey, that's what they said last night too.  That's what they said on Hannity Incomes.  Very smart of you, Gene.  They're just testing the system.  They said they were either going to do something, or they're making trouble trying to get this  ACLU and make a suit and do something like that.  Real terrorists would never behave that way.  They look like Americans.  They would never be over the top that way.  And you know what?  Look, I'm sorry for most Muslims, but other guys who are doing stuff in the name of Islam, 
[01:42:00]  what do you expect?  How are we supposed to?  They're the ones saying we're doing this in the name of Islam.  We don't say that.  What do you want us to do?  When you're in a plane that's plummeting, heading toward the ground, the last thing  you want to do is go, you know, I should have done something.  I should have said something because I felt there was a problem.  Where was this story, by the way?  This was in the news a while ago, maybe a couple of months ago initially. 
[01:42:30]  But then some details started coming out that it wasn't so innocent.  And Hannity just shut that guy up last night.  I heard that in the car last night.  Oh, there was one guy and he's like, this is the slippery slope.  And, you know, these people have a right to religion and you're making people paranoid.  And he jumped out right on top of Hannity.  Hannity turns around and goes, hey, hey, I haven't even introduced you yet.  Quiet.  How great is that?  Like, jumped on him.  I started laughing my ass off.  Isn't it amazing?  Like, good for you, Sean. 
[01:43:00]  The ACLU screaming, these people have a right to religion, are the same people that scream  about separation of church and state.  I know there are different issues, but they just have no allegiance to anything.  They say it's their allegiance to the Constitution, but they're just phonies.  How about this?  And this x-ray screening thing will pave the way to widespread abuse.  How about this?  You pass a law that says you can't post this or you can't do that.  And then if it gets abused, you deal with it in court.  Yeah.  How about that?  Hey, is this possible? 
[01:43:30]  Someone on the Instant Feedback, Scott, he writes, this was a feeler mission to see  how far they could get away with things.  I've thought that, too.  They were scouts gathering information.  I've thought that, too, but I don't believe that.  Why dress like that?  Exactly.  Why pray at the, you know, they should have been.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're gathering info, you're not going to start by dressing the part.  You don't want to raise eyebrows again.  Right.  That's the last thing Islam wants to do.  Not Islam, but the guys that are plotting things don't want to test it by raising eyebrows.  You'd be testing other scenarios, not the obvious one like this.  They'd be testing, like, if one guy. 
[01:44:00]  Like, maybe, hey, maybe if I wear a New York Yankees hat.  If one guy is weird and they throw him off.  I thought one time there was a guy, a Muslim-looking guy behaving so weirdly.  He's, like, looking over his shoulder.  Remember that guy, Kenny?  I'm like, this guy is a distraction.  He wants people to look at him for that guy and that guy.  I got a little paranoid.  But look, you know, when it happens time and time again with the same group, you're going to get paranoid.  Yeah, of course.  Don't be mad at us.  But look, when old Jews or Chinese people start taking down planes, believe me, I'll look at them, too. 
[01:44:30]  Yep.  It's human nature.  Hey, really fast, we talked about this before the break.  Woman dies after marshmallow eating contest.  Oh, it's the greatest story ever.  I know we just threw it into reverse here.  I understand.  But we found the story.  A woman is dead after choking during a marshmallow eating contest at the Western Fair in London, Ontario.  The 32-year-old woman died in hospital Wednesday, a day after collapsing offstage during a chubby bunny competition.  Chubby bunny competition.  Speaking of Al Roker. 
[01:45:00]  Coming to the Opie and Anthony show, the chubby bunny contest.  What is the chubby bunny competition?  Well, it says the contest features people stuffing one marshmallow at a time into their mouths, then saying chubby bunny until they can't say it anymore.  The person who gags, chokes, or spits out the marshmallows loses.  Can we do a chubby bunny contest tomorrow in New York City?  I say we do.  Tomorrow.  Apparently it kills people.  We have to have, we'll have any, I guarantee they didn't have any medical personnel on set. 
[01:45:30]  It said emergency crews who arrived on the scene tried to help the unconscious woman.  So, yeah, probably not nothing on scene, but couldn't remove the blockage in her throat.  Yeah.  She was revived at the hospital, but later died.  What an awful little body she has.  Chubby bunny, chubby bunny.  I can't breathe.  Chubby bunny.  And then, okay, she said it.  Shove another marshmallow in your mouth.  Yeah.  Chubby bunny.  Another one.  Dudes, look, it's not original. 
[01:46:00]  Let's go right on record, but we have to do the chubby bunny.  You want chubby bunny contest?  We have to do it.  God, if someone died.  We need EMTs on scene.  We got those guys.  They're part four fans.  They'll show up.  They're not chewing or swallowing.  They just got to kind of...  No, that's the problem.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  I guess one full of, like, spit toward the back of her throat, like one of the first ones  she put in.  Yeah.  Kind of, they get slippery, slip down her throat, and lodged in a windpipe. 
[01:46:30]  Maybe she was fat and nobody wanted the Heimlicker.  Give her a Heimlicker.  You can't get your arms around her.  Yeah.  You got to do, like, ten people doing a ring around the Rosie around her.  All right, pull.  Looks like Hands Across America.  All right, look.  Take this back to New York with us.  Throw a big bunny.  Let's run it through the Institute.  See if it works.  Yeah, we'll throw it.  The O&A Labs.  Exactly.  We'll try it out at the O&A Lab, and we'll see if we bring it to the public.  Eric, we may use you as a guinea pig as a punishment for that story. 
[01:47:00]  You're going to have to do chubby bunny, but not with marshmallows.  We're all going to stand in front of you.  All right, here's the...  Jimmy, you got it, though.  Tomorrow in New York, you're testing out the chubby bunny live on our show.  We're not even going to do it in the lab.  We're going to try it out in front of everybody.  Right out in front of everybody.  I want someone there to make sure that Eric doesn't choke.  Well, we can.  Yeah, we'll get the EMTs.  I don't want young hawk dying on the air.  I don't need that on my conscience.  So the deal is you throw a marshmallow in your mouth.  You're not chewing or anything.  You're just getting it in there, and then you have to say chubby bunny. 
[01:47:30]  And then once you do it, another marshmallow goes in.  And then another.  And then another.  Another.  And you can't swallow any of them or chew them or nothing until your mouth is so full  that you can't say it.  But it's a competition.  And here come the marshmallow jokes for me.  Yeah, of course.  I'm sure.  Oh, boy.  Of course we all remember.  Oh, I did not try the chubby bunny another way back in Geneseo, you asses.  Chubby bungee.  I have to use the restroom.  What?  I have to use the restroom.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  Oh, is that what you grabbed the paper for to do a little reading? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Can you tell the Duchess of York behind me that I'm going to be squeezing by him with  that awful sitting pose?  You can see Club Soda Kenny right now.  Hey, Rula Lenska.  I got to go to the bathroom if you don't mind.  Rula Lenska.  Oh, my God.  He crosses his legs?  His legs are crossed, he has a hand on one knee, and his big right arm, his big phone  book head caver in her, is propped up on the back of the seat, and he's resting his  head like Da Vinci is going to paint him, like he's a Rubenesque woman. 
[01:48:30]  That sitting pose, if I ever catch you doing that again, I'll throw my waist on you.  He's ready for his portrait.  That's exactly what he looks like.  It's awful.  People are pointing out, though, that he is monitoring the weather.  Yes, he is.  Of course he is.  He's sitting by that window.  He's obsessed.  And the worse the weather gets, the happier Kenny is.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  All right.  Club Soda Warhol.  I'm going to go use the rest of them.  Adam on Long Island, what's up?  I have participated in Chubby Bunny Contest. 
[01:49:00]  Adam.  Wait, this one.  There you go.  How you doing there, Adam?  What, terrific.  How about you?  Good.  All right.  What do you got, Adam?  I, too, have participated in Chubby Bunny Contest.  We've done over 20.  Nobody has ever gotten hurt.  Nobody has ever died.  Nobody has ever choked.  However, the spit-ups have been pretty horrendous.  You've got to be a loser to die from a Chubby Bunny competition.  Hey, where do you guys do the Chubby Bunny Contest? 
[01:49:30]  Actually, it's been a group of friends, mostly drunk, hanging out.  You know, it just seemed like a good idea at the time.  You're bombed off your butt.  And people gag on it?  No, I haven't seen anybody gag.  I mean, there's a little bit of confidence involved.  And usually, you know, when the marshmallows come up, it's pretty horrendous.  Oh, they're all wet and ick.  You have no idea, man.  It is heinous.  It is heinous.  But if you want me to come down, I will be more than willing to come up against Jim in a Chubby Bunny Contest. 
[01:50:00]  I am dropping a gauntlet.  Oh, shut up!  No, we've got it, my friend.  Chubby Bunny with guys not hot.  We're looking for girls to do the Chubby Bunny Contest.  What we are going to do tomorrow, though, is we're going to have E-Rock try it out to see what we need to do for the actual contest.  All right?  Mikey in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, you guys are talking about how those five guys are so obvious being, like, you know, dressed up like Muslims and everything else? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  They're playing work.  You guys paid attention to the five idiots that dressed up like it, but you didn't see the other three idiots that got on board.  Yeah, but the plane landed.  Maybe that was a distraction.  But the plane landed safely.  Maybe it was test.  I'm a retired air marshal.  Oh, okay.  And the crap that they pull.  Shoot the hostage.  I'll tell you, there was times I was on a plane, I just wanted to walk down the aisle and just drill a guy on just general principle. 
[01:51:00]  How are you a former air marshal?  How old are you?  I'm 48.  Oh, I was going to say, what did you do wrong?  No, nothing.  I retired.  That's what I did right.  All right.  All right, so you think it was a distraction, but the plane ended up landing safely.  Yeah, but it could have been a test run.  A test run?  A test run?  Like I would see if that worked, yeah.  Oh, that's a good point.  Everything that they do that you think is, like, stupid and retarded is a test.  They do so much stuff every day all over the place.  You don't even hear a third of an eighth of what goes on at airports. 
[01:51:30]  Do we have to have this discussion before we fly today?  Ah, you keep an eye out, and you know something, they better have a whole goddamn plane full  of them then, because any shenanigans get started, and that's when people get killed  in the planes.  People sit on them.  The whole crew gets up and starts punching people in the face.  That's, you know, that's like these LL Airlines, Israeli Airlines and stuff like that?  Yeah.  You, if you got up and you started mouthing off to a stortus, the entire plane would kick 
[01:52:00]  your ass.  Right.  And the stortus would look at you and go, what were you thinking?  And then they'd all try to represent him in a case.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mikey.  Have a good one.  All right.  There you go.  We're going to step aside here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Live from West Palm Beach, Florida, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is so awful.  It's just great radio. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Why?  Sure.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Went all right for you, Jimmy.  Let's just say this.  It looked like two of the three temptations.  And with that, we say hey.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, we've done a lot today.  We've got more to do. 
[01:53:00]  Kind of looking on the prep sheet here.  We've got to decide.  We've got Stephen Hawkins, or Stephen Hawkins, saying humans must leave Earth to survive.  We've got NASA.  They're building a base camp on the moon.  They're saying that this is going to be done in 20 years.  Old people still do it.  Of course they do.  We just don't want to hear about it, right?  How many old people are really doing it?  Dude, the Viagra.  Yeah, but...  They had the stories come out where... 
[01:53:30]  They've got to have women that are willing and able.  Well, that's the problem.  The women have been coming out of the woodwork going, oh my God, I curse Viagra because my  life was fine.  I spent many, many years having sex with my husband, and it was great, and we had kids,  and we had a great, healthy sex life.  But then, you know, you get older, and you kind of fade into some other stuff with your  relationship.  And then they invent this Viagra, and then the guys are back at it with them, and they're  just not into it anymore.  But you fade into other stuff like, what, cancer?  Good for these old guys. 
[01:54:00]  Guys, let your golden years be filled with humiliating her like you did through your younger  years.  Old codgers.  Exactly.  That just reminds me of those HBO shows again.  Wow.  You know, whenever they do that real sex on HBO.  Do they still do real sex, by the way?  I don't know if they're still doing it or just rerunning old ones, but they seem like  they're all the same.  Yeah.  They have the one with the elderly, you know?  Like, they go to a place, because they always have to go to someone's house that seems to 
[01:54:30]  be the know-it-all.  Some hippie freak.  Some old, yeah, hippie broad.  And the old people go there, and it's to, like, rekindle their love life, because their  sex life has gone down the tubes over the years.  And they go there, and they're all together in one room, laying on a floor.  And the woman, the know-it-all hippie broad, is telling them what to do.  And they're naked.  They're all just nude, looking just like awful, like material hanging off the end of a table. 
[01:55:00]  Like doilies.  Their bodies.  And they're, like, rubbing each other.  Now, give your husband a back rub, and just these translucent, veiny hands, rubbing this  back with skin tags all over it is just not sexy.  She's the sex coach, right?  Yeah, she's the sex coach.  And then they show, you know, them getting into areas that are a little more sensitive 
[01:55:30]  than just their back.  And that's when the grandpa's laying there, and he goes, like, oh, oh, and you just hear  this room of grandpas moaning, and these old broads putting their hands where they haven't  been in years.  Oh, that's it.  Very good.  Very good, Myrtle.  Myrtle, you're doing a fine job.  Oh. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  She got the grandchildren's charm bracelet dangling.  Eight grandchildren tingling away.  Jingle, jingle, jingle.  Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.  Oh, they're going to have to be washed, because one slipped and kind of went somewhere stinky.  Why do you have one black grandchild?  Ah, forget it.  Hey, we should get into those shows.  Watch them every time.  They highlighted a couple little sentences, but this thing is worth reading from the beginning.  They're looking for love and learning some harsh lessons. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  The truth about elderly sex and the consequences.  Elderly slam.  November 30th, 2006.  At the pinhole?  Pinhole?  It looks like pinhole, but it's at the Pinhole Senior Center in Northern California.  There are lots of gray-haired folks huddled around the computer these days.  Uh-oh.  What do they do?  Contrary to expectations, they're not there to learn how to email their more tech-savvy  grandchildren.  No, these grandmas and grandpas are looking for love on the internet. 
[01:57:00]  How about they have some dignity and just go online and search for burial plots?  Work out the inheritance and move on.  Selfish.  Betty Pluck.  Ew.  Or Pleek.  I don't know.  You pronounce it.  P-L-E-I-C-H.  Betty Pleek.  Ugh.  Betty.  Ugh.  Betty.  Ugh.  Betty.  A 75-year-old widow is open to the possibilities of internet dating.  Bet she was hot when she was nose art on a bomber. 
[01:57:30]  Enough with Betty.  She says she couldn't imagine her grandmother searching the web for a beau, but this generation  is different.  I think we want to get out and go, Pleech says.  We don't want to sit back in the rocking chair.  We want to spread our wings still at this age.  Yeah.  And those are wings with gravity.  Ugh.  Old dusty wings.  And she's, you know, I'd always heard that colored gentlemen were built a certain way. 
[01:58:00]  I joined this website and they certainly are.  It was all so forbidden back then.  Now, I'm open to anything.  Yeah, one in the front.  Two.  Each hand.  You can be a five-hole.  Just a disgusting whore of a granny.  Hey, whatever happened to our old stripper friend?  Wasn't she in her 70s and still stripping and we got her to do it in front of a live audience 
[01:58:30]  a few times?  What was her name again?  Which one was that?  Not Sandy.  There was another one.  Not the piano player.  That held up for her age anyway.  Remember she had like really nice boobs for a 70-something-year-old and I don't even think  they were implants?  I can't remember.  I'm sure Steve still has the videos up on foundrymusic.com somewhere.  Sandy actually held up for her age if she's 600.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I was waiting to get that one out. 
[01:59:00]  That was a...  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  Oh, that was...  That was...  You might want to go back into the bathroom and see if you could plunge up your sense of  humor.  That was...  Geez, I thought that was...  If she's 600...  Okay, terrific.  Well, hey. 
[01:59:30]  Kenny's hair actually blew by after that joke.  All right.  He recovers.  Of course I do.  I hope it rains on that stupid head of his so we can see that afro.  I know he has an afro.  Of course he does.  When you add water to that hair, it just goes boom.  I know.  He's not a cop anymore.  He's starring in Cooley High.  I'm Lauren Sheldon Jacobs.  Hey, you want to go on with this here?  Yeah.  Love lessons.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  The online dating class is taught by Connie Acton and her boyfriend of eight years, Tom 
[02:00:00]  Bowie.  Connie is 74.  Tom is 70.  Nice.  They met when he attended her basic computer class.  Ew.  I remember when I was a kid and I looked at my mother.  She remarried when she was 49 and I thought, what for?  You're 49.  You're almost dead.  Now I'm looking at her and thinking she was a kid almost at 49.  With their full active and busy lives, today's older adults want a partner to share it with.  Active and busy?  Yeah.  So busy about being a burden.  Exactly.  I'm busy walking in a circle and calling people who'd rather not hear from me because I'm a 
[02:00:30]  reminder of their mortality.  Hey, hey, hey.  They're saying 70 is the new 40.  Yeah, is it really?  Yeah, they're saying that, Jimmy.  Good, then I can't wait to see these 40-year-olds in coffins because I'm tired of them.  Busy.  Slow driving.  Putting flat spots on tennis balls on their walkers.  That's what they're busy doing.  That also means having a robust sex life well into their 70s, 80s, and even 90s.  No way.  Stop it. 
[02:01:00]  You want to have a sex life?  Check yourself into a home and then lay face down while the orderly makes his rounds at  two in the morning.  How's that?  A guy that looks like Bubba Smith will tear off your awful jammies and straighten you out  better than your husband ever did.  You think in some of those situations, the old broad goes, ah, what the hell?  What the hell?  Of course she does.  What am I going to do anyway?  Fight him off?  Feed tube in her mouth.  Ah, let's see. 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  It also means confronting a harsh reality of the modern world.  Sexually transmitted diseases.  Stop it already.  Grandma's getting the crack.  There are barely any diseases going on with the old people as far as the screwing goes.  Yeah, when you get everything dried up, you know.  Unless they're transmitting osteoporosis through their seed.  Wear a condom.  I don't want to get Alzheimer's.  Have unprotected sex. 
[02:02:00]  Next thing you know, you're forgetting everybody's name.  Here we go.  Safe sex after 60.  I see older people who think sexually transmitted diseases are for the young, says Dr. Blah,  Blah, Blah, Blah, Assistant Blah, Blah, Blah, at Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.  Here comes a stat.  We don't get gonorrhea.  We don't get chlamydia.  We don't get HIV, her patients tell her.  However, Dr. Blah, Blah, Blah says, that's a fallacy.  Patients often are too shy to ask their doctors difficult sexual questions.  So doctors need to ask them directly, she says. 
[02:02:30]  I say, how is your sex life?  And then wait for the answer.  And that normalizes and makes it much easier for an older woman to say, well, there's some  issues that I want to talk to you about.  Every time I sit on a seat, the cushion comes up with me.  Is that unhealthy?  Dr. Blah, she has this book, What Your Mother Never Told You About Sex.  It's Blah about asking her patients if they're practicing safe sex. 
[02:03:00]  It could save their lives.  But you're 70, you're 80, you're 90.  Age is going to waste his time on you if you're 85 years old.  Age will have mercy for you.  We'll just show up and sit there.  I love this.  Stats show that although the highest number of new HIV cases is people in their 30s and 40s,  there are now more patients being diagnosed in their 50s than in their 20s.  Well, of course, there's a little more education with people in their 20s and people in their 
[02:03:30]  50s are in that prime age where they were banging unprotected when, you know, it was really going  on back in the 70s, old disco thing, a little snort, some unprotected sex, Studio 54.  70s?  Those people aren't that old yet.  Let me think.  If they were in their 20s and the 70s.  Then they're mid-50s?  Yeah, then they're in their 50s.  That's what they're saying.  Oh, okay.  More people being diagnosed in their 50s than in their 20s. 
[02:04:00]  I missed out the show there, Ian.  I'm sorry about that.  I was thinking more speakeasy time for some of these people.  So once they're practicing safe sex, Dr. Hutcherson says it's time to make sure they're having  enjoyable sex.  Sex is lifelong, she says.  You can never give up on something that is so important.  That surprises many old people who've been led to believe their sex drive lessens or dies  out later in life.  It surprised Joan Price so much when she fell in love at age 57 that she was moved to 
[02:04:30]  write a book.  It's titled Better Than I've Ever Expected, Straight Talk About Sex After 60.  Can I say the one line back here that you jumped over this paragraph and it just creeps me out?  Yeah, go ahead.  The book has gone to a second.  Printing it also led to a blog in which middle-aged and older men and women write for some straight  sex talk, everything from when is too soon to become intimate with a new man after a  spouse dies to reclaiming sexuality after cancer.  Wow, that is hot stuff. 
[02:05:00]  What fun reading that must be.  Well, why don't we have that reading in front of us?  I would love to know.  Why don't we have that reading in front of us?  Let's try to find that blog.  And to answer the question, how long do you become intimate after a spouse dies?  I say an hour.  I say, while you're still crying and wailing on his chest in the hospital, an orderly should  come up behind you.  That's right.  Back to the orderly jokes.  We never leave them.  We only place them aside for a second.  Oh, I can't believe it, Irving. 
[02:05:30]  What are you doing, sir?  Now 63, Joan is a newlywed.  She met her husband, Robert, when he took her line dancing class.  Yeah.  When he took her to a line dancing class.  The sex, well, she's happy to report that it's never been better.  At 63, her sex has never been better.  You're a liar.  She has had an awful life of, what, rape everywhere she goes?  Like, everything was just a rape.  Well, once my husband Attila died.  Yeah, what the hell? 
[02:06:00]  At 63, better than ever.  Stop it.  I had expected as a young person that old people, A, didn't have sex.  B, if they did, they didn't enjoy it because it was something that young people did, she says.  And then when I fell in love at age 57, I was amazed at how wonderful it was, not only being in love, but also our sex life.  Oh, I hope her husband's one of those guys that bilk old broads for their money.  Yeah.  It just leaves one day.  Hey, did you just say, eh?  Yeah.  That's how this...  No, he said bilk.  Well, you went, eh. 
[02:06:30]  Did I?  Yeah.  Well, I asked that, Jimmy, because that's how the article ends.  Oh.  If anyone out there is saying, eh, about older people having sex lives, Joan Price says, just wait.  And Dr. Hutchison admonishes people to never give up on love and sex.  It should never, never be something you just lock in a closet and say, those days are over.  We got to find that block.  Never, huh?  Do you see some of these people walking around with the walkers and on the little rascals? 
[02:07:00]  You think those people can't just say never and forget about it and think of it as a thing of the past?  Granny walking around with a four-pronged cane.  Those orange bright tennis balls on that walker.  The new walker with the handbrakes so Granny don't go rolling down the hill.  Hey, the walkers help, though.  Yeah, but...  She can lean forward nicely.  Oh, you're thinking for a sexual device?  She's ready for a doggy anywhere she goes.  Oh, nice.  Anywhere she goes.  You and your eight friends get behind her. 
[02:07:30]  Could I have a package of condoms?  And I need some KY and 14 tennis balls.  We're really going to wear them out tonight.  Just sliding on the linoleum.  Yeah.  Let's go to Josh in Florida.  Josh.  Her mangy poodle watching the whole thing.  Hold on, Josh.  Hey, go ahead, Josh.  That's all right, Josh.  Go ahead.  I just wanted to let you guys know, you guys were talking about how old people don't get  sexually transmitted diseases.  There was an outbreak of, I think it was chlamydia, at a retirement town called The Villages a couple months back. 
[02:08:00]  The Villages.  Really?  Well, we've got to find that now, too.  I've got to learn about this.  Here's the stat I love.  Thank you, sir.  The one that says, you know, the elderly are the fastest growing population getting HIV.  Yeah.  And it's like, okay, let's look at the stats.  And they say, well, it's, you know, up 100% from last year. 
[02:08:30]  And then you look and realize, one had it last year.  Now, two have it.  Two have it.  Yeah, that's why stats stink.  Stats are ridiculous.  If you go inside the stats a little and just look around, you realize how ridiculous stats  are.  Take a little peek.  When you're in your 70s, if you have chlamydia, all you've got to do is cough and it falls  out.  Hey, it's not going to get better than that.  We've got to get out of here, man.  Yeah.  We're going to do the walk to that fine balcony out there. 
[02:09:00]  Check out the dark rain clouds here in West Palm Beach.  Is it cold out there?  And then we'll come back in in about 10 minutes and we'll continue on XM Satellite Radio.  All right.  Hey, tomorrow on the show, we're going to do the Chubby Bunny Contest.  With E-Rock.  He's going to try it out and then we're going to get some girls to do the Chubby Bunny  Contest.  All right.  I want E-Rock to be monitored.  I want him safe.  Yeah, we got some EMT guys in New York.  They'll come by and see what's going on. 
[02:09:30]  Also, don't forget the second video from the Eggnog Drinking Contest has made its way  to Break.com.  We're pushing Break.com big time because they were there for us when we needed them.  That's right, man.  Unlike YouTube, YouTube panicked and just canceled all the Eggnog Drinking Contest videos and  now they're finally deciding that the videos are okay for their fine sight.  Go screw.  Ooh, language.  Go S in your hat.  Ooh, language.  So we promote Break.com.  The second video, that would be Sergeant Magoo filling up a beer pitcher with his own puke 
[02:10:00]  and then pouring it over Froot Loops and then eating the Froot Loops.  Not only did he do that, also Pat Duffy ate Sergeant Magoo's puke Froot Loops concoction.  Well, the video is now up on Break.com on the front page.  How cool is that?  Very cool.  Very cool.  All right, guys.  We had a lot of fun down here in West Palm Beach.  We're going to continue from here, but we've got to say goodbye to the locals, obviously.  Yes.  And the gang at the Buzz.  They really, in the end, they were really, really good to us, man. 
[02:10:30]  And thank you to CBS, by the way, for that gift bag.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I just can't wait to use my calculator slash memo book.  I'd like to smash your face with it.  Whoever's idea was to get those gift bags, I'm going to smash your face.  That's for general managers, you know.  They live boring lives.  How awful.  Number crunching.  They've got a golf shirt that has the CBS logo on it.  They're very excited today.  How about next year you give everyone shotguns with toe attachments and CBS on the barrel? 
[02:11:00]  All right.  We're out of here, man.  We'll see you back in New York.  If you're not joining us on XM, we'll see you in New York tomorrow.  Thank you.  We'll see you in New York tomorrow.  Thank you.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, live from West Palm Beach.  It's just those guys having fun again.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We're back on XM Satellite Radio, live from West Palm Beach, Florida, as the rain moves  in here.  Getting a little rain.  It's going to be an interesting day of flying.  Hopefully no delays getting out of here.  You know what's above all this?  Nice sunny day.  Oh, isn't that the best?  Nice sunny day when you get up there.  When you leave the crappy weather and all of a sudden you break through the clouds and 
[02:12:00]  it's always sunny up there.  Then you've got to come back down into...  Never a cloudy day up there.  Ever.  Once you get up there, it's nice and clear.  Right.  You keep going and then it's out of space.  Hey, I've got to say hi to Bob Hates You from New Hampshire.  Bob Hates You?  On the instant feedback, he writes,  I was just in my car and did not have my satellite radio, so I was stuck listening  to regular radio.  I turned you on and heard the worst 20 minutes of radio ever.  All right.  Do us all a favor and die. 
[02:12:30]  I am now home and have my Sirius on.  This is so much better.  Ah.  A, how would he know where to send this if he wasn't familiar with the show?  Right.  B, why would you listen for 20 minutes?  See, Bob's a liar.  That's why I don't like Bob.  Bob, you are a lying sack of shit, my friend.  You obviously listen to this program.  Like Jimmy pointed out, how do you know where to go?  Why would you even comment? 
[02:13:00]  If you just listened for three minutes and didn't like what you heard,  you would turn it off and then just go about your business.  Find something else, go home and turn on your crap unit and listen to that.  Yeah, he made believe he just stumbled on our show.  I stumbled.  Whoa, whoa, what is this?  I got to listen to 20 minutes.  Speaking of Sirius, you see the bad news?  No.  Lowering expectations.  Aw, they're up.  Oh, boy.  What happened to the Howard factor?  They said that their sales for so far since Thanksgiving for the Christmas season, 
[02:13:30]  not quite what they thought they were going to be.  Yeah.  You laugh every time.  Yeah, retail sales since the Thanksgiving weekend have been less than expected.  Good Lord.  Good Lord indeed, Mel.  They're going to be seeing less subscribers by year's end than they expected. 
[02:14:00]  And Mel, Mel Karmazin had to say in a statement,  this year's retail sales results since Thanksgiving weekend have not been at the pace we had anticipated.  Good.  Aw, what happened?  Where's all those millions of listeners?  Howie's bringing in.  I want to know how could you focus on that statement from Mel Karmazin when you're too busy just checking out those crazy eyebrows of his.  Oh, I know.  How do you look at him?  It's like, what are you saying? 
[02:14:30]  I'm looking at the caterpillars above your eyes.  So there you go.  The Howard factor is officially over.  What happened?  And even the company is admitting that.  They're moving in new directions from what I read.  They're not emphasizing Howie as much.  Mel himself has said that Sirius, it's not all about Howard.  Ah, there's plenty of great stuff.  Yeah, great.  It's not all about Howard until the bottom line comes out and you realize how much they're paying him. 
[02:15:00]  And it is all about him.  And they got a huge ad campaign that hit the airwaves and they don't mention Howard at all.  They realize they got to move on from the stupid Howard thing finally.  They got to try to get new listeners for other reasons than just Howard.  For a year, they've just been pushing this Howard thing.  What happened was the hardcore, dedicated fans that still call up radio shows and Larry King and say ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, they are the ones that signed up. 
[02:15:30]  Once that happened, after a couple of months, they got some stragglers and then it just dried up.  They thought they were going to get these new listeners out of somewhere.  Where is Howard getting new listeners from?  Everyone knows his act.  Everyone knows what he does.  It's not like a whole batch of new people are going to go, oh, I've never heard of this guy.  Let me check it out.  So it's done.  So now they got to, yeah, what they're doing now is kind of steering away and going, okay, we realize that. 
[02:16:00]  Let's concentrate now on music and other things that we can put on the air.  Football, which stinks on radio.  Why would you buy a football package when there's only 16 games a year, you dumb motherfuckers?  Baseball, there's 160-something.  You're driving on a Tuesday, you listen to the game.  No one listens to fucking football on the radio.  You have Dish Network or whatever you have and you watch it at home.  Nobody fucking listens to football.  It's hard to listen to football on the radio. 
[02:16:30]  I love hockey.  That's really hard to listen to on the radio.  It's impossible.  Baseball is pretty much the only sport you can listen to on the radio and really visualize what's going on.  It's the right pace.  Yeah, it's just the right game for radio.  Because there's so many of them.  It's a weeknight sport.  So a lot of times you're driving the kids or maybe you have to go.  There's a surprise ass fucking somewhere.  You got to get there quick.  Hey, I got to go back here.  Scott from Japan.  This is why we have the greatest listeners on radio.  Because when we miss an obvious thing, they pick right up on it. 
[02:17:00]  Good for them.  And they're right there for us.  Scott from Japan writes,  I think that instant feedback user complaining about you and praising Sirius has an outlying embedded joke.  He couldn't bring the Sirius with him because it was in its own IT room complete with cooling fans.  And that's why he was in the car without his satellite radio.  Yeah, why doesn't he have it in his car?  Maybe his trailer hitch broke.  And by the way, I inadvertently mentioned Dish Network, and we're not on Dish Network. 
[02:17:30]  No, no.  We're on DirecTV.  Yeah.  So let me say for the record that I think that Dish Network is just a bunch of cunt faces.  But we do live reads for that other company when we're on regular radio.  Oh, do we?  Do you?  That's the football pool.  I say cunt faces with all love.  Yeah.  I love cunts.  I've met people from Dish Network.  I lick their faces.  We laugh and laugh.  They gave us $10,000, so you might want to give them a little love. 
[02:18:00]  10 G's?  That's nothing.  I spend more than that on a prostitute.  Spit on that money.  I give her a fucking eight grand just to eat my ass and finger it and laugh about it later.  There you go.  Why did I say that?  It wasn't funny.  It was just dirty.  But now that was.  So you set up your own funny.  Hey, just want to remind people we're going to be on Jay Leno December 21st.  Mm-hmm.  And now there are rumblings.  This is just the greatest, how things are spun constantly. 
[02:18:30]  Now there's rumblings that Howie's going to be on Letterman possibly the same day.  Oh.  And now they're saying the reason we're not doing Letterman a second time is because Howard  swept, you know, swooped in, whatever.  Are you shitting me?  And they bumped us to get the king of all nothing.  Right.  That's what happened.  On Letterman.  Yeah, that's what happened.  No, there was a huge battle that went on behind the scenes.  And in the end, Ant and I decided that, hey, we did it on Letterman.  We're going to see what we can do on Leno. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Why can't we just do both?  We have no problem with anybody.  And Leno's been trying to get us on for over a year, maybe even longer than that.  And Leno's been a supporter since day one.  And, you know, Letterman, they promised us we'd be back on in December, but they never  gave us a concrete date.  And then when they found out Leno was going to, you know, throw us on on the 21st, well,  the date was a little, was it going to be the 18th or the 21st?  It turns out to be the 21st.  Then Letterman's people came aboard and said, well, hey, hey, hey, we'll throw you on on  December 21st. 
[02:19:30]  That is the real story.  You're going to hear other bullshit as as we move on.  And I'm going out there with you.  Yeah.  Yes.  Great.  Yep.  And again, I said yesterday, I'll say it again today.  There's no reason for me to be out there, but it's Christmas time.  Right.  And I want a free trip.  So what do you think of that, Hugh?  How about them apples?  Jimmy, you're cordially invited.  Cordially.  But I can't even pretend.  So who's, Anthony was so nice. 
[02:20:00]  I said, I want to go out.  He goes, you could be a liaison.  Liaison.  You don't need a liaison.  Between me.  A show.  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  Liaison.  In all honesty, all I will be is one more person standing in the dressing room eating off  your fruit plate, which is a euphemism, by the way, from eating your cock and balls.  Once again, when you lack humor, go for cock and ball jokes.  Fucking one trick faggot pony.  With that, let's go to Chad in New York.  Chad, what's up?  With a gay joke.  I suck dick. 
[02:20:30]  Cricket, cricket, cricket.  Chad, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, Bobby, Anthony?  What's up?  That other iammer, he's listening for 20 minutes because he's waiting for his series to warm  up.  Yeah, the tubes.  That's very funny.  It's an old tube reference.  Very nice.  I like tube jokes like anyone else.  Who doesn't?  Hey, so we're at the manager's meeting.  I didn't forget.  I didn't forget.  If you weren't listening earlier this morning, we had to keep it clean for regular radio. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  So there's this general manager.  It's CBS flew all their general managers and general sales managers down at Boca Raton.  For this big manager's meeting, flying these guys in first class from all over the country.  And then when we ask for $1,000, they say they can't afford it.  Bullshit.  That's what we say today.  So we're schmoozing down there in Boca.  Had to drive about an hour from where we're at here in West Palm Beach.  And so this general manager, who we know very well, they'll put the pieces together. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let them speculate all they want on the message boards.  We know this general manager very well.  So think syndication back in the day.  It's not Tom Chiusano.  No.  And he comes up to us and he tells this story about being turned on by the radio a bit.  A bit where this lesbian was talking about her experiences.  I guess maybe her first time lesbian experience.  Uh-huh.  And he's telling Anthony and I, and he's going, I got so hard listening to the radio. 
[02:22:00]  And as the bit went on, I got harder and harder and harder.  The way he was saying it, though, was, was, was like, I'm sitting in my car listening to this and I'm just sitting there in the parking garage and, and I got a hard on.  And I'm listening to this more and more.  And as she's going into it, well, like I'm just getting harder.  And, uh, you know, I'm really getting a hard on. 
[02:22:30]  A raging hard on.  I was sitting there.  I'm getting rock hard.  And all of a sudden I'm feeling really uncomfortable and just dirty.  He's a creep.  He goes, I just wanted to walk away from this situation.  I want to know about this guy's fucking hard on.  He's a creep.  He goes, I'm 46 years old.  Another clue, by the way.  I'll tell you when the clues come.  I'm 46 years old and I like to fuck anything that moves.  So, so, so I'm sitting in the car listening to this, just getting harder and harder. 
[02:23:00]  I had a hard on like I've never had before.  And, and I are looking at each other like, what is wrong with you, you creep?  Guys don't talk like that.  We'll say a girl turned, you know, a girl turned me on or whatever.  But we keep it kind of like vague where you understand what that means.  Yeah.  But he had to just keep talking about his hard on.  And then he said he couldn't get out of the car until he said the bit was done.  But we're thinking that he jerked off in the car before going to work.  I'm thinking he would have said he did.  You think?  Like, like, that's what I was, I was totally expecting.  I was thinking messy suit having, how to, you know, turn, uh, uh, throw out his underpants 
[02:23:30]  in the bathroom before going into his, uh, his general manager's office.  Another clue.  What kind of accent did he have?  What do you sound like?  Do an impression of him.  Like what city's accent?  Yeah, like, well, just, no, just like, how do you talk?  It's not Ken Stevens.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Everyone's going to speculate wrong. 
[02:24:00]  It's an accent you don't like, uh, Jim.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you know.  Really?  Yeah.  Ah.  You've met this guy a few times.  He's a younger guy.  Oh, he's 46?  Yeah.  Accent I don't like.  Uh-huh.  What's going on down there?  Huh?  What's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  What's he doing down there?  Can you go up there, down there?  What's going on?  What do you want to do? 
[02:24:30]  You want to go over the bridge?  Maybe go to Cinnamonson?  But guys shouldn't be talking about their hard-ons with other guys,  is what we're getting at.  Absolutely.  Just show it.  Good old creepola.  Just show it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least Jimmy shows us, and it's just a goof at that point.  I was just kidding.  You know, it's just silly.  Ah, it's silly.  At that point, it's silly.  Anybody want to see it?  Not really.  Not really.  No, you're right.  All right. 
[02:25:00]  We were going to talk about this about two hours ago.  I had a scratch.  Sorry.  Bacteria in airplane bathrooms.  Oh.  Because you guys are claiming you got sick from the airplane.  I didn't know it.  The flight down to West Palm Beach.  I didn't know it.  I need cough drops.  I'm sick now.  My throat.  It's a little scratchy.  Feeling sickly.  It's not Tim Sabian.  No.  He don't work.  We're guessing on instant feedback here.  Yeah.  No.  He said Tim was a program director.  Although I can picture that hard-on through those tight slacks that he used to wear. 
[02:25:30]  And his tasseled shoes.  And that just looked huge.  Right.  I just...  Remember his ass cheeks just freaking moving separately as he walked?  Very disturbing.  I just got a text from my girlfriend that I'm giggling.  Sorry.  Can you share with us or...  She wrote, should I eat?  And I wrote, yeah, I got a meal for you in my pants. 
[02:26:00]  Bop.  Bop.  And she wrote back, die.  I'm glad to see the relationship is going well, Elijah.  No, it's not Oedipus.  All right.  Here we go.  We got sterile swabs from an accredited lab.  We took a couple of flights and hit the bathrooms, swabbing the sink, faucets, and door handles according  to the lab's directions.  Then we took the samples back to the lab and had them tested for total bacteria levels and 
[02:26:30]  also E. coli.  Now we're getting a little bit more specific.  Now we're talking about bacteria fecal origin.  There we really don't want to see anything.  That's right.  Fecal matter on the faucet handles and in the standing water around the sink.  Oh, great.  Well, after people shit, they use their dirty fucking shit fingers to hit the goddamn thing  to wash their hands. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  How do you think you'll wash your hands?  Dude, wash shit on your hands, though.  I don't know.  How do you not?  Can't help it.  You're wiping those little bacteria bits.  I know.  A fleck.  You've got to be really careful.  You ever got a shit fleck on your hand?  Oh, no.  I've had shit flecks on every body part.  Oh.  If I was a super...  Great.  Now I've got to sit in my seat and not go to the fucking bathroom?  Yeah, that's why I play this.  Ever again?  Purell.  You bring Purell.  No.  This is low. 
[02:27:30]  An American Airlines flight looked very clean, not a crumb on the floor, but the bathrooms.  We sampled one shortly after takeoff and then again an hour later.  The results?  Exactly what I would expect, that there's an increase.  A big increase.  He sounds like a fecal creep.  He's a fecal...  He's a fecal eater.  He's a fecal expert.  A fecal freak.  Yes, I was happy to report that we found fecal everywhere.  Thank God, I found exactly what I expected.  That's why I went into this business. 
[02:28:00]  I found shit everywhere.  I love shit.  Shit on the door handles, on the toilet seat, on the faucets.  See, he comes out, it's smeared all over the place.  Matter of fact, I put a black light on the mirror and they even spelled shit with shit on  the mirror and he's a superhero.  What a great day for me.  His name is the fecal kid.  He comes out with a brown mask and a big F on his cape.  The fecal kid.  That's right.  But he doesn't fly over things. 
[02:28:30]  He flies through lawns and on floors.  Yeah.  And people are reminding us about something here.  Eric in New York, go ahead.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, boys.  If you remember, Tracy Morgan talked about splooging on the door handle.  Yeah.  Remember that story?  He was flying and he decided to leave some sperm on the bedroom door knob.  And then left it on the door handle.  Great.  All right.  Let's go back to the fecal expert.  There's an increase. 
[02:29:00]  A big increase.  We got to hear.  There's an increase.  Is that all he said or is it a little more?  Would you?  Yeah.  Exactly what I would expect, that there's an increase.  A big increase.  The fecal bacteria in our sample count jumped from zero to a half a million parts.  You can see that anybody using that restroom then at the end of the flight is probably going  to contaminate their hands and their clothing and whatever else they touch. 
[02:29:30]  God, can he sound any more excited than anything else they touch?  I'm jacking off as I tell you about the fecal that I found.  Up there, cock.  If you shove a finger up your ass in those bathrooms, you might catch something.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What a glorious day for me.  Oh, is that horrible?  The fecal kid?  The fecal kid.  The fecal kid.  FK is his name.  This is my nirvana.  What a...  So, I guess go at the beginning of the flight and that's it. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Be the first one in.  Be the first one in.  Sure.  Because at the end?  Or use the paper towels to like, you know, turn everything.  Oh, believe me.  I'm like, I become a magician in there.  Use my feet.  Man, I laugh at that crap.  I laugh at germs in bathrooms.  I don't.  I use my mouth to open the door.  I'll grab the handle with my lips.  The toilet seat, you lift it up with your tongue.  My tongue.  At this point, your mouth's got to be immune to the fecal.  No.  No?  Oh, yeah, maybe.  It's kind of like, you know, they tell you when you go away, you got to drink the local 
[02:30:30]  water.  Gives me the munchies.  To get a, you know, to be immune.  It's just a big flying, you think, it's a big flying germ tube.  And you think you go in there and you wash your hands, but then you got to touch things.  The paper towels that you're drying your hands on.  Oh, boy.  Probably got shit on it.  James Gumb.  Gumb.  James Gumb.  From Pal Talk.  Opie, cough if the guy with the raging heart on was. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, wow.  You got it?  Got to give it to the guy.  What the hell?  All right.  Here's the last part of the story.  American Airlines said they clean their planes after every flight.  They suggested we would have had a different result if we had sampled more than one flight.  Delta objected to our methodology and said we might have gotten similar results from any  public bathroom.  Most healthy adults can withstand those levels of bacteria, but just to be sure.  In the toilet? 
[02:31:30]  Use a paper towel.  Use it on the faucet.  Use it on the sink.  And even on the door handle.  Then you've gone a long way keeping nasty germs out of your life.  She's there in the bathroom with the fecal.  Nick from Western New York.  Is the fecal kid clubster Kenny's alter ego?  I told them it would infect everything.  You know?  Very unsanitary.  How's it looking for us getting out, Kenny?  Got an update for us? 
[02:32:00]  Those clouds are getting darker behind you, Anthony.  Hold on, hold on, Kenny.  There you go.  So far, so good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Been in constant contact with the airline?  Yeah, we're going to be fine.  All right.  Just want to make sure.  Yeah.  Don't want to be late.  No.  Well, now where the problem's going to arise is tunnel traffic getting in rush hour when  we land.  Ah.  Go get us a helicopter.  Helicopter.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm sure they'll spend $3,000 an hour for one of those. 
[02:32:30]  They flew these freaks in from everywhere so they could talk about their hard-ons in front  of us.  Get us a helicopter.  Ooh.  Isn't rush hour, uh, it shouldn't be that bad, right?  Uh, going into the city?  It's always bad.  Tunnel.  Either way.  Tunnel, yeah.  Tunnel traffic going into the city when you think everyone's leaving the city.  It's just, it's almost, it's almost worse, Anthony.  Why?  Uh, Jason in Chicago.  Oh, I know why.  Yeah, I'm not worried.  They close up some of the tubes.  I'm not worried about that.  Less options going in. 
[02:33:00]  Uh, go, Jason.  Yeah, I'm not worried about the bathrooms on the planes.  I think they should take a blacklight after the blankets on there.  I know I've soiled more than one of them with the wife on board.  Oh, the little blue blankets they give you?  Oh, yeah.  They don't wash them, man.  Postage stamp pillow?  Ugh.  Just plop it under your ass?  All right, thank you, sir.  I'm, lay a batch out on that blue blankie.  We got listeners that showed up at West Palm Beach here.  They're down the hall again, right? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  And one of the guys brought his own bits in?  What's this about?  What, whoa.  I don't know.  That's ambitious.  He's just so anxious to see everyone.  That is ambitious.  Is he good?  Are they convinced?  What does he do?  What kind of bits?  I don't know, but he's got a gift for you, Jimmy.  Did you listen to this?  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock will be doing the Chubby Bunny tomorrow.  Let's remind everybody.  That's right.  With cocks.  And we're going to bet to see how many marshmallows he can get in this fat face.  E-Rock, compared to your chili story, how good are these bits? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, my story is stellar.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, what's the deal with the bits?  A couple of them, he wraps around just on-air bits that Anthony's did.  He just introduces them, plays Anthony's bit, and said, that was Anthony, master impressionist.  Ew.  That's it.  Isn't that how you do best of?  Yeah.  Worst of?  Whatever of?  And the other ones, he does, his name is Eric from O-Town.  He does the Bad Joke Minute.  He tells topical jokes using sound effects from our show. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  And that's what you want us to play right now?  That's what he's asking.  And what's the Gay Howard remix?  It's really, the quality is so bad, I wouldn't even play it.  Well, is the first guy here?  Yeah, he's there.  Can we get him in so we can look at his dumb face while we're playing these?  Come on.  Yeah, that's half the fun.  Making fun of somebody to their face.  I don't know if it's going to work, though.  Uh-oh.  Let's see.  That's Eric.  I know him.  Take two.  Yeah, well. 
[02:35:00]  You know that guy?  I've seen him before.  He's got your shirt on.  Yeah.  Doesn't seem to be working.  Got a Jimmy Norton shirt, Monster Rain shirt.  Put on the headphones and talk into the microphone.  Jesus, Kenny.  They're nervous enough.  Hey, how's it going?  Can you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Speak when you're spoken to.  Oh, sorry, Kenny.  Sorry, Kenny.  Yeah, you want to be in radio, bro?  I'd like to someday.  Yeah, you got a little...  Get next to the microphone.  Okay.  Is it on? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, it's on.  So what's your deal?  You got the Jim Norton Monster Rain shirt.  These guys have pointed that out, yes?  Yeah, correct.  I got that when he was down a couple months ago doing the West Palm Show.  All right.  And you brought in your own bits.  Yeah, I was just working on a few things.  Some of the Paltzot guys gave me some ideas a long time ago.  And I had this one thing I was doing for Anthony for the Master of Impressions because he does so well with it.  Thank you, sir.  And that's like one of the things I like most about Anthony.  Oh, who doesn't?  Especially, of course, the Stern stuff and all that stuff.  It's great. 
[02:36:00]  So, yeah, but you're not really doing anything that's yours on this.  No, it's just stuff that I was making, you know, just like production pieces I was trying to practice with.  Oh, so he's showcasing his production prowess.  Well, here it is.  Let's give Gary Busey a chance.  Yeah, here we go.  He was thinking first nation.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  He's Anthony Kugel, Master of Impressions.  Today, Jerry Seinfeld and Kramer.  Kramer, you've got to stop apologizing. 
[02:36:30]  You're ruining everything.  I'm trying to sell season seven, Kramer.  It doesn't matter, Jerry.  The f***s don't buy this.  That's buying Martin and other f***ing shows, Jerry.  Kramer, you're a beloved character, Kramer.  What are you doing?  Just stop talking.  Whatever show you get on, you're screwing up.  I'm not screwing it up, Jerry.  I'm apologizing for this.  I'm not supposed to.  Don't get me started again. 
[02:37:00]  Look, there's another.  There's another.  There's another.  And it's you.  Be sure to tune in next time for another edition of Anthony Kugel, Master of Impressions,  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I think you need a little more treble on a piece.  Kenny, tell him not to laugh so hard.  Sorry.  That was a little nervous.  Did you hear what Opie said?  Yeah, don't laugh too hard. 
[02:37:30]  Or if you're going to laugh, back up.  Okay.  People are suggesting, can he throw this guy off the balcony?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What made you go with the in a tin can sound?  I was trying to use the line in, but it wasn't working, and I could not figure it out why.  So I just had to use the mic, and I couldn't figure out.  So you just put a mic on a speaker?  Yeah.  I use it.  That's always the best way to get a good sound.  I didn't put it directly next to it.  I put it a few feet away with a louder volume because...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So it got a good, nice room echo. 
[02:38:00]  That's how Steve does all his production.  See, I'm still kind of practicing with it.  I mean, I'm not really good with technology.  I'm just learning, practicing.  Yeah.  Kenny, tell him on this show we don't chew gum when we're on mic.  Did you hear what Opie said?  Yep.  Spin it out.  Swallowed it.  Oh.  Wow.  What a good date.  That's good.  Wow.  All right, what else do you want us to play from this bit disc? 
[02:38:30]  We hear the Gay Howard thing is so bad we can't even play it.  Yeah, it is horrible.  No, I mean, quality-wise, you can't.  Yeah, it's bad because I forgot to edit.  I actually didn't even attempt to edit that one.  In fact, I didn't even know I put it on there.  We got to hear it now.  We got to hear it now.  Now we have to.  That's the beauty of us.  This is something we shouldn't play on the radio, but now there's an interest.  All right, here's the Gay Howard remix.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  Hi.  Howard Stern.  What's going on?  Where do you measure from?  Well, how many inches?  Are you very small?  Let me ask you something.  You have the look of love in your eyes, but I'm an ugly man.  I know this.  You couldn't be physically attracted to me, could you?  That's Gay.  You need a father figure like me.  All right.  You know what we're going to do to solve your problem?  I'm going to have sex with you right now over the radio.  Good.  Oh. 
[02:39:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Good.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus.  Disgraceful.  We should be taken off the air.  I'm brilliant every day.  Every single frigging day.  Thank you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:40:00]  Get ready.  Yeah, you might want to.  Get ready.  No.  Kenny, tell him not to wreck my bits.  Now I can't do it  Apologize  Sorry, Hopi  No, that wasn't sincere enough  Oh my God  That was so bad  Yeah  I can't even look at him  Including the news of my grandmother's death 
[02:40:30]  That's the worst thing I've ever heard  Oh  All right, try to save yourself  What is the Eric in O-Town bad joke minute?  Well, I remember in the pal talk room  I used to go in there all the time  And Eric, they always called me like the cancer of comedy  Yeah  And so one day I was like, what the hell  I'll do a bad joke minute  Because I remember you had this formula once that said  Benny Hill music equals funny  Always funny  I was like, I bet you I can make it where it's not funny 
[02:41:00]  Did you have a line in for this one?  Or did you also do it in the bottom of a pool?  Yeah, it was in the bottom of a river, Jim  Oh  River  Even harsher water  This is your moment  And you know you blew it, right?  Yes, I know  I'm really nervous at first  It doesn't just play out in your head 
[02:41:30]  Like if I was trying to get someone's attention  You know, trying to get into the radio and stuff  I would have made sure my stuff was crystal clear at least  I know, I just couldn't figure out how to get the quality good  So why wouldn't you just maybe wait?  Because I was going to tell E-Rock to just listen to it  And I was going to send you guys a better coffee when I edited it  Oh, that would have made all the difference  Someone wants to know how their really nice crystal clear XM turned into shitty AM radio  There's got to be someone in the industry coming up with that one 
[02:42:00]  All right, well here's the Bad Joke Minute with Eric in O-Town  Hey everybody, this is Eric in O-Town with the Bad Joke Minute on the Duke Lacrosse Trial  Hey, how do you guys get a group of Duke Lacrosse players off a rape trial?  Simple, have the black women tell the story  The rest of the mundo  Yeah, apparently it's said that she had sex before going to the boy's house  Saying it was a boyfriend  Well, if you're giving money for sex, that's not a boyfriend, that's a client 
[02:42:30]  Oh, good lord  And the woman has changed her story about six times about who it is  Well, how do we make you tell the truth?  Give you a bucket of fried chicken and some Colt 45, you stupid whore?  Yeah, finally, you know, if these boys are innocent, I hope they sue her for fucking slander  What are they going to take?  Everything she owns  A crack pipe signed by Whitney Houston  Hello, exactly!  And in the future, for any white people that want a stripper, make sure she's white and not black to avoid scandal 
[02:43:00]  Oh, man  I want to apologize for the listeners out there, Gary  This is the home version of the O.P. and Anthony show 
[02:43:30]  Wow  We should have a home version of the show  That, I  I  Um  I  I  Uh, Jimmy  I got nothing to say to that  About, I  Humor  Reacts to you the way air does  On a plane when a hole is blown in the side of it  Like 30,000  Couldn't agree with you more, Jim  At least let him get it out before you say you couldn't agree with him more 
[02:44:00]  It might be, uh  Yeah  Yeah  Humor reacts to you  I, I concur  Yeah, timing is very important to comedy  Nightland  You want to try another one?  Uh, Bad Joke Minute number two  E-Rock says yes  Oh  Oh, please  What does E-Rock know?  We have to  Strap in, kids  Oh, yeah  There it is  At least the audience is digging it, though  Yeah  Yeah, the PalTalk people  Uh 
[02:44:30]  What are they saying there?  Oh, nothing but rave reviews  Yeah  You're getting, uh  Jump out the window  Eat a bullet  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, boy  Kill myself after a Nancy Grace interview  Stop it  Don't worry  I lost all my tears in high school  Well 
[02:45:00]  Hey, everybody  This is Eric in O-Town  Once again for Bad Joke Minute  Today starring Heather Mills  You know how much of a pain in the ass it must be  When she's going to the airport  And there's a whole fucking line of people  Nothing but the fucking alarms going off  Whoa, whoa, whoa  Stop right there  It's just fucked up the phone, didn't you?  Yeah  All right, wait a minute  Wait, wait  Wait, wait  Could you please explain that joke? 
[02:45:30]  I was actually drunk doing this one  That's not an explanation of the joke  Listen, warrior  Yeah, listen, Dr. Octopus  Oh, sorry  Yeah, I remember that, Jimmy  I remember  I want to know  They usually say Bernie Lomax  But that works  No one says Bernie Lomax  Who is he?  Who's Bernie Lomax?  Weekend of Bernie's  Uh-huh  What's going on in your mouth now?  Throat's dry  Yeah, you are really, like, nervous  He's got, like, more white shit 
[02:46:00]  In the corners of his mouth  You have awful pasty, like, breath  No, I chew  Don't chew a lot of gum  Hold on  Here, she's going to  Throat gets really dry a lot  So why would the people have to wait  With all the alarms going  What alarms are going off?  See, that's the part I realized  I didn't understand  I was just like  I don't know  I was thinking of something else  I don't know what was going on  On that particular one  Oh, yeah  Well, the fucking alarms  Were fucking going off  Yeah, yeah  I was thinking of maybe 
[02:46:30]  If she had, like, the fake leg  With the metal in it, maybe  Yeah  Like a prosthetic  That could have maybe been  What the clue could be  Yeah  Man, you know what  You know what you got to do?  Yeah  Actually, take that joke  I'll rework it for you  Okay, go ahead, Ant  You and a friend are at the airport  And there's a woman in a wheelchair  With two legs over her shoulder  Oh, yeah  And you turn to your friend  And say, I wonder if she's flying standby  Now, that's funny  Yes, it is  That was great  I saw that one  I give that to you 
[02:47:00]  By the way, yesterday on our ride to Boca, Jimmy  We were treated to Kenny doing your act  Kenny doing your act  Yeah  Would you allow him to do a piece of your  Well, it's your newer material  It's a tribute to you  Because he  I was actually laughing  And it was Kenny doing it  Kenny can only do material  From a yellow discipline  Or trinkets I own  Made from Gorilla  Yeah, you don't want the new stuff, right?  That's right  Especially not the way he'll butcher it  You got some of the older stuff?  I would have to listen to it 
[02:47:30]  To refresh my recollection  All right  I want to hear Eric's mouth a little bit  Yeah  Like what?  Like this?  Oh, God  Is he a wreck?  Dancing feedback  Going crazy here  I usually only  Sorry  Kenny  You got nothing from Kenny that time  What?  No  Someone reprimand  I told him to have water  Before he went on  All right 
[02:48:00]  Hold on a minute  It's worth it  All right  Here we go  Sorry for the delay  What's the matter  Sweetie Pie?  No, it's updating so fast  This guy from Long Island  I bet this guy actually pretends  To be on the show at home  I bet he's got a mic  Hanging from somewhere  That doesn't plug into anything  And he just like  Talks like he's part of the show  Chimes in  Downloaded one of the sound boards  Yeah, plays like  So he's got the car crash  And  Yeah  Eric, can you do this? 
[02:48:30]  I can  Does it all from the comfort of his tin can  All right, should we continue with this?  Oh, please  Your mouth is really pasty  Yeah, I heard that  Heather Mills was giving a standing ovation  At a PETA speech  Only when she stood up  She fell flat in her fucking face  Yeah, well, here's one for you  Well, when Heather Mills is having sex 
[02:49:00]  She can't spread eagle  Since she's a leg short  She comes up spreading sparrow  Wait, sparrows have two legs  Of course  Well, it looks like I better get out of here  I think I'm killing my welcome  So I'm going to haul ass out of here 
[02:49:30]  That's the arriving sound effect also  And why would a sparrow  They have two legs  Like spread eagle  Why  Why a sparrow?  I'm just thinking something else  A very small bird  Instead of an eagle being something big  You know, like a sparrow being something little  Yeah, but wouldn't a one-legged thing  Right  Something  I don't  Maybe pick a bird that  I don't know  Stands on one leg  Or a spread  That would still be a stress  A spread flamingo 
[02:50:00]  Right  Because they stand on one leg all the time  You know, something like that  But the spread sparrow  I  I want to  I want to punch you  I wouldn't blame you  Oh my god  You are awful  When god was handing out  Talent and charisma  What did you do  Besides hide  And yell  None for me  Thanks  I stuck my head in a toilet  And hoping I would drown  Stuck my head in a toilet  And hoping I would drown  He's so nervous 
[02:50:30]  What if Hank spit anything out of his face  Dude, you can just spoke in any term you wanted  I know  Wow, you're really devoid of humor  He's a nervous Nelly  I'm a nervous Nelly  I really am  Look guys, I think we've heard enough  I'm sure you don't want to hear  Bad joke minute number three  I'm obsessed with bad joke now  I have to  We really need to take a break  Don't you think?  I have to hear this  I want to hear that  Open that window, I'm going  If there was bad joke number one thousand 
[02:51:00]  I want to hear them all  We'd miss our flight back to New York at this point  Is that what you're saying?  This is so bad  It went from so bad  To not even being funny bad  Holy shit  To worse  Actually, going with what you just said, Anthony  Mighty Casey from Mudville, yes  Eric even fails at being unfunny  Yes  You're just nothing  You're devoid of humanity  It's a humor vacuum 
[02:51:30]  It's a bell jar  That had humor in it  And a small compressor gets turned on  And sucks the humor out  Just in case you have to do experiments  In a humorless atmosphere  That is what you do  Holy shit  Well, let's listen to the last  Bad joke  Don't pull me out again  It's disrespectful  Thank you, Kenny  Number three 
[02:52:00]  He doesn't know if you should  I told him to use a line in  Sorry  Hey everybody  This is Eric in O's  With another bad joke  By the way  Just so you know  Yeah  Might be a little too inside  But I started the track  And then we had to wait five seconds  Watch  Oh  Go  Yeah  It's Eric in O's  With another bad joke  A minute  Regarding something about  Cock in the ass 
[02:52:30]  You know  Elizabeth Smart was on the news  And the reporter kept asking her  About her kidnapping  What she should have asked is  Did Elizabeth ever have a cock in her ass  Shut the fuck up  Yeah, apparently  I knew this girl  When she was a teenager  She said she had nightmares  About being molested by an uncle  But in reality  She woke up  And she actually did have a cock in her ass  Yeah, on top of that  If some girl doesn't want to give up  Any pussy to you  All you gotta do is just 
[02:53:00]  Punch her in the face  Bend her backwards  And fucking put your cock in her ass  Shut the fuck up fat man  Now just as a public service announcement  If anybody is gonna commit a crime  And you're gonna go to jail  Just remember  Always keep the soap on a rope  Because if you do end up  Dropping the soap  You're gonna  That's right  You're gonna get a cock in your ass  Shut up, Demi  Content-wise 
[02:53:30]  It's not much different  Than what Steve does  You just punch her in the face  And put your cock in her ass  Razzle dazzle  At least a little bit of laughs  No, we're not  No, no, see  We're not laughing at you at all  Jimmy took your shit  And formed it into something  And Steve  That resembled humor  Okay  Wow  Would you mind if 
[02:54:00]  Club Soda Kenny  Gave you a wedgie  Yeah, I would  Because it's gonna hurt  Well, you hurt us  I know  Actually, you know what  Kenny  Go for it  Oh, wait  Do you have gifts?  Yes  Oh, what kind of gift  Yeah, let's see the gifts first  Eric's a good boy  Before the wedgie  Okay, I'll take it for the team  I deserve it  What would you like to give first?  Opie first  Alright  Thought it'd be good  What a good boy he is 
[02:54:30]  This is for Opie  This is something I've had  For a long time  Okay, I'm sorry  Go ahead  I'm like  It's an old Nirvana tape  It's like some concert stuff  It was a really hard find  That I got  I've had it for a long time  Cool  And I know you were a big fan  I said  There's only one person  I'd give that to  And that would be Opie  What songs are on there?  Like, where is it from?  That actually seems like  A pretty cool gift  Wow  VHS tape  God, I love Nirvana  Yeah, VHS  Featuring  Man, I kind of like this kid now  Featuring  It's from 1994 
[02:55:00]  This is very rare, Anthony  Wow  Live Tonight sold out  It's not a bootleg  No  Cool  It's featuring the songs  Aneurysm  About a girl  Dive  Love Buzz  So this is very early stuff  Breed  Smells Like Teen Spirit  Probably performed for one of the first times, right?  Mm-hmm  Well, not if it's 1994  Negative Creep  Come As You Are  Territorial Pissings  Nice  Something In The Way  Lithium  Drain You  Poly  Sliver  And on a plane  Very nice  What else you got? 
[02:55:30]  I don't know what to say  Do you have a  I see you a  Oh, Jesus  Who the fuck has a VHS these days?  VHS?  That's a rare tape, though  It's in the box  It's very rare  Yeah, because I couldn't find it on DVD  Because it doesn't exist on a DVD  Sure it does  Oh  Well, he can burn it  It doesn't exist on VHS anymore, either  Oh, jeez  Oh, oh, oh, no  Use the claw side  Yeah  Eric wins his 50 bucks  Oh 
[02:56:00]  Yikes  Yeah, that'll  Oh, it's choking the fuck  There it goes  That time it came apart  What do you have  A reel-to-reel  Frantening  And an 8-track for me?  No, actually  For Jimmy  I remember  Hold on, please  There it is  You could transfer that  On to DVD  Yeah  Now that it's out of the case  Who has a VHS?  No one has a VHS player anymore 
[02:56:30]  Oh, I know  Thank you  I guess it's the thought  Yeah, the thought  Counted  Good point  Somewhere  When is that good  Until that yogurt?  I don't know  I want to  Where's my spoon?  You want to use mine?  I'm done  What's  I want to know  What Jimmy's gift is  Well, do you guys remember  A long time ago  When the fan sent you  The drill with the cord?  Yeah  Well, I got you, Jimmy  A cordless drill  Oh, look at that 
[02:57:00]  The 7.2 volt  Black & Decker  Cordless drill  For drilling  Anywhere  Any time  Charges in about an hour  Comes with two batteries  And  It's got an adjustable chuck  Does it?  Keyless  Two-speed trigger  Do you like it, Jimmy?  Use it around the house  Hanging pictures  Anything from  Hanging pictures  To drilling holes  In young Asian boys' heads 
[02:57:30]  Before you send them out  To have the police  Send them back  Into your house  So you can kill him  No, it's nice  Because  When you do a bit  And someone brings you  Something two years later  Yeah  At least he's timely  You like it?  Yeah  It is nice  Are you going to bring it  Home with you?  No  Can I have it?  It's good  Just more stuff to pack  What do you mean?  Can I have it?  No  Why do you want it? 
[02:58:00]  I just want to see it  You won't hurt it, will you?  No  No  You promise?  First of all  I gotta say  I've done a lot of work  On job sites  The Black & Decker  Is probably  Indestructible  Yeah  So I would love to even  Give it a try  I defy you  Alright  To even injure that thing  From the balcony?  It is  Fucking Kenny  Captain Obvious  Oh Kenny 
[02:58:30]  You wet their lips  And stick them to the wall  Kenny, Kenny, Kenny  Wow  Thanks for the punchline  Before we did the joke  Well thanks for that gift  Oh no problem  Hope  Hope you sir  See Ant was setting me up  Nicely  Knowing there's a balcony  Kenny  And that would have been  The dramatic ending  To the Jim Norton gift  And you know something  Would have seen a drill  Really come apart 
[02:59:00]  Right  See but now  That you said balcony  There's no way  I could possibly  Go out there now  With the drill  I think Kenny  Should yell at himself  Why not  You could still do it  Ah a little voice  Yeah  But the joke  Is kind of done now  Yeah  See we like the element  Of surprise  See people would be like  Wow well how could he  Possibly  Break the drill  In studio  You know  Think of the first time  He had a hard time  Breaking the VHS tape  With a hammer  How would he possibly  Get this done 
[02:59:30]  And then it would be up to me  To surprise everybody  Kenny think of the first time  Gallagher  Came out  With that watermelon  Right  And no one  In the front row  Knew  Now they all bring  Raincoats  And plastic  But that first time  When he put that  Watermelon out there  And people looked  And he went  Wow look a watermelon  And if Kenny stood up  And said  He's going to smash it  With a mallet  They all would have went  Oh hey hey  Kind of takes the element  Of surprise out of it  You know  A little bit  Alright I'm sorry 
[03:00:00]  Just a little bit  And it would have  Broken apart good  That would have  Come apart  Yeah  See a drill  Come apart like that  Oh well well  We'll just leave that  At the point  That's how it's  For laughs at you  They'll use it for something  What do you got for Anthony  Well thank you for the gift  What do you get  It's hard to bring  Now Anthony  I'm sure they told you  Why would I talk  I had to do this  For a living  I'm thankful  You leave my feel free  Right and just jump right in  I was wrapping up a thought  But why wrap up a thought  When you have a brand new one  Okay  You look like you  Could be E-Rock's  In prison brother  Like you got the hair 
[03:00:30]  For it and everything  And you actually bring  The same amount to the show  Yeah  I bring nothing  Oh poor E-Rock  No I actually have your order  Oh  Speaking of the Nirvana thing  Someone spent 20 seconds  On Amazon  And found the same thing  On DVD  Oh yeah  On DVD  Yeah so there you go  What do you think Eric  20 seconds  There you go  One of my friends  Told me he didn't find it  So now I'll beat him  When he gets back  Which one of your friends  My friend Eric  You have no friends  Dummy  Everyone named Eric  In this room is a dummy

[03:01:30]  Good quality stuff  It's from the store  So obviously  It's a rhetorical question  It really didn't  It kind of meant like  You know Nazi or American  See when people  Would have thought  I meant American  Yeah  So it's a DVD  Yes it's a big  Let's look about  An 8 or 10 disc collection  Oh  Alright well  Wow  A lot of footage  Great  Wait see we don't  Have any interns here  Send it up to New York  Alright  Thanks  Well thank you  What's your name  Eric  Thank you for the thing  I don't have  Eric  Yeah Anthony's  Thanking you  But I'll  I'll look forward to it  In the mail every day

[03:08:30]  Outside  Just trying to  Barrier off the spill  Thinking it was some kind of  Petroleum  I fucking spilled a load  Last night into a bag  It was like  The tip was drooping  Over the side  It looked like a stocking cap  My fucking  It was  The cock before Christmas  My balls kept going  Bah humbug  Bah humbug  I fucking  That reservoir tip  Is the shit  I fucking bought these  Lifestyle 
[03:09:00]  Because she's going on  The  I shouldn't be giving  Her personal shit away  But she doesn't have  XM in the van  So  She's going on the  Birth control  She's very responsible sexually  It really annoys me  She will not do anything risky  Yeah because you're using condoms  I mean if you're  A faithful listener  To this program  Jimmy just hasn't done it  Jimmy doesn't believe in that  Probably didn't even know  How to use it  I fucking  I put it on my fingers  I'm like what is this  He lapsed it  His fingers and toes  I gave myself away  When she's a user  I put it over my balls  I'm like let's go honey  And she's like  She made us both get tested  And 
[03:09:30]  And  And we're both good  And then she's like  No because she's going on the pill  So she's like fucking bags  Until I'm on the pill  That's it  She's not getting knocked up  So  Oh my god  So that's probably  Now how long you gotta wait  A month  But I mean whatever  But I mean now wait a minute  There's gonna be that first time  Right  Without anything between  It'll be fucking like  Alright let me just put  No  What if she does an oopsie on you  And goes  Oh I thought that was

[03:10:30]  To fuck with a rubber  I've used them plenty of times  But they're just annoying  Lube safe for latex  Yes  Some lube break down latex  Of course she checked  My friend  Now  Not the one  Not  Fucking  Alright  Not Dr. Spock with breasts  That I've been dating  She fucking checks everything  And we put some lube on my dick  And then you slip the condom  But it's still been annoying  But these lifestyle ones  They come in a round compartment  And they're fucking 20% less thick than condoms  It's like  She's running her fingers over the back of my dick  And I can feel it  Like it's amazing 
[03:11:00]  There is a certain brand of condom  That is kind of tight around the  The end that goes kind of against your balls  You know  Yeah  The end against your body  And then as it goes to the tip of your dick  It gets wider and wider  To the point where it's not even holding snug to your cock  It looks like  It looks like a hot air balloon on your dick  So when you put it in  It's actually moving over your dick 
[03:11:30]  It's not like you just got this fucking rubber  Right  Slapped on your cock  It's like loose  Yep  Over it  Better than just regular condom  It is like a little balloon  Around the clit in 80 days  It's fucking  I can't believe the load I dumped  I can't believe the fucking load I dumped  Really  It's almost embarrassing  Just come out the sides of the cock  It's running down your balls like a rabid dog  It wasn't a shot  It was like 
[03:12:00]  It was like somebody vomiting cottage cheese  Out of the side of a stroke mouth  Blarka, blarka, blarka, blarka, blarka  It wasn't a shot at all  It was dribbly tapioca  Blarka, blarka, blarka, blarka, blarka  Out of the side  Normally I'm like  Oh shit  And some girls  You know normally when I  Blarka, blarka  When I shoot  I fucking shoot man  I shoot to the back of the throat  I'm like  I fucking shoot a load  But when it's been a fucking long time  Blarka 
[03:12:30]  It sounded like a fucking  It sounded like a foghorn going off  Blarka  Filled my fucking reservoir tip  You ever stand up  And the reservoir tip dangles between your legs  It was like an elephant trunk  I played games  I went  Blarka  And I took it off  And slapped her in the mouth  Walked out of the bathroom  And stabbed by your knees  I swung it like a medieval mace  And cracked her in the mouth  And we laughed  It sounded like so responsible 
[03:13:00]  It sounded like you had a great night, Jimmy  It was wonderful  Oh shit  Hey, speaking of sex  Well, we got the blog of  Of the old people having sex  What is the name of the website?  Maybe we shouldn't give that out  Do you want it?  We had the story earlier about how old people are still doing it  And then there's a blog where I guess these old people could go on  And share their experiences  Well, it's one talking about stuff  And then others obviously will post  So here are some previous posts from old sex ladies blogs  Yeah, I'm going to want to go to this site in a little while 
[03:13:30]  And see who's posting  What's it called?  Yeah, what is this site?  What is the site?  So it's maybe old gravy leg composed  Connor  Dude, this is  The whole gang  Before we destroy this website  Get all the good stuff off there  Yeah  Because there are some amazing  We could do this for a month  Some of these blog entries  Previous post from old sex ladies blog  She talks about reclaiming sexuality after cancer  Too soon to be intimate with new men after spouse dies 
[03:14:00]  That was something Jimmy was talking about  Yeah, yeah, yeah  She also talks about autumn of love  Autumn of love  We're having hot, fabulous sex after 60  How do you handle sex and dating?  A man asks about sex after prostate cancer  Yeah  Thank you readers  Uh-huh  What juicy younger women need to know about sex and aging?  Juicy younger women?  That means when you have to dump fucking tomato paste into your cunt 
[03:14:30]  To give it some kind of lubrication  Because you're 78  What used to get wet naturally  Now has to have tomato paste rubbed around the sides  Like you're fucking  You have to get some Pam oil  And lift your fucking meat flaps and spray in there  Come on honey, time to sit in the old Crisco  Hey Teflon cunt, get in here, I'm horny  Guys, take what's in front of you  What's with you?  And put it to the side for now  Oh  Why, Opie?  Something must be 
[03:15:00]  Opie, what's going on?  Something must be happening  Ladies and gentlemen  If you weren't listening earlier  Pat from Minaki was kicked out of the IFOCE  Because of the baby bird video  That is being viewed like crazy on break.com  And other fine websites  International Federation of Competitive Eating  He got kicked out because of his conduct  During the baby bird video that everyone has seen at this point  Pat was in the Nathan's 4th of July hot dog eating competition 
[03:15:30]  So he's been in, you know, the big ones  So he traveled to Atlantic City and other places  For potato eating and stuff  He was really into this  And he'd been in it for about a year  And it was a big part of his life  It made him very happy  Well, from the IFOCE  We talked about him earlier this morning  It's George Shea  George!  Hello!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  Thank you for having me  George Shea  What is your exact position?  What do you do with the organization? 
[03:16:00]  I'm chairman  Chair of the IFOCE  Chairman  So you oversee all the rules and regulations  And make the decisions?  I do  Also, obviously, you know  We have a board and a commissioner  And this type of stuff  But yesterday's decision  I was certainly involved in  And I understand there's been  Quite a bit of discussion  Yes, a lot of discussion  A lot of controversy  And, you know  Two sides to this whole story 
[03:16:30]  We were very surprised  That you could actually get kicked out  Of a competitive eating league  Well, you know  It seems like a goof sport there, George  No, no, no  I mean, you know  If you guys  You mentioned Nathan's earlier  And certainly there are other major events  Where you have, you know  Literally  A billion media impressions  You guys know all about this  Coming out of something  And when you do that  It's certainly a real thing  It's a powerful thing  And people are involved  And in our case  Not a lot of money  But nonetheless  You know 
[03:17:00]  We were at the IFOCE  And I have a major announcement to make  But I will preface that by saying  Pat has always been an asset to the IFOCE  We deeply feel that he is a national treasurer  And he's a treasurer of our organizations  Because he brings levity  And he has a certain  I don't know  Demeanor  That's very nice to be around  However, we were disappointed by the video  Which we felt  Went against the good taste  Okay  However  However  Based on an enormous outpouring 
[03:17:30]  Of support  By your listeners  Which who have reached out to us  With many, many emails  Asking that Pappy reinstated  We are going to review  The expulsion  Oh no, no  Oh no  Oh no  Why did you  He was just going to say 
[03:18:00]  Oh no  Oh is  Is he back  Because there might be some phone calls  From people who are concerned  Yeah  George  Hey Pat  George, you there  George  Pat  Pat  Pat Frumanaki  Pat, you know  Listen  Listen  You know the deal  We're on the road  West Palm Beach, Florida  The equipment's a little  Oh, the phones  It's not what we're used to  And something  Seemed to 
[03:18:30]  Seemed to  Got awry  Something happened with the phones  I don't think my picture  In the IFOC  Is too bright  So I don't know what George  Was about to say  Maybe George could call back  Is there any way we can get him back  And Pat could maybe talk  Because it sounded promising  Pat  Yeah  I heard that click  Why don't we  Something happened  I'm back  I feel so bad  George  George, there he is  I'm sorry  I don't know if that was us or you 
[03:19:00]  But there seemed to be a cut out  We had problems with the phones  We're at  In West Palm Beach  At a station  Down here  And not at our usual  Place that we broadcast  From in New York  So the phones  Are a little screwy  We've been having trouble  With them the whole day  And we apologize  For that  Especially  For something as important  As this  That this is to Pat  Because he is a great friend of ours  I will continue  Because I think this is a matter  Of significant importance  Yes  Absolutely  And what is that sir 
[03:19:30]  We have decided  He was going to decide something  I really love competing in Nathan  You guys  Or Pat  I've also decided something  I want to shove a Nathan's hot dog  Up George Shades' ass  Oh no 
[03:20:00]  Someone is calling  Dogshit Sniffer  You guys are binge watching  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside  Opie you are the hawk  To the baby bird  Oh  He was just ready  To make another  Big announcement  Decision  Alright  The stupid phones  Are so irritating  I hate this  Yeah  Nothing could be more frustrating  Pat hang in there  We got the engineer  Here in West Palm Beach  I was so close  To being back in  No he's doing some tweaking 
[03:20:30]  As we speak  The engineer down here  In West Palm Beach  Well you know  Maybe  This should be done  Maybe this should be done  Before the show  Is on the air  And we should have  These phones fixed  Right  My goodness  Yeah there's a little  Bug in the system  A little bit  If you will  Yeah  Is there any way  To get George back  On the line  Yeah make sure  I feel bad about this  Maybe give him  A different line  Or something  Yeah  Were there any listeners 
[03:21:00]  That wanted to talk to him  Yeah I'm sure  I don't think you guys  Are giving the support  It's the respect it's due  Hey Pat  Before we get George Shea  Back on the line  What do you think  Of George Shea  I think he's  One of the wonderful  Characters  Of competitive eating  Oh  That's not what you said  Earlier there Pat  Gee I was kind of groggy  Before  What did I say  George Shea  Yes  Hi George 
[03:21:30]  What's up  Again I gotta apologize  This is embarrassing  On our behalf  We're trying to  You know  Get to the bottom  Of this  And hear what you  Have to say about Pat  Pat's very excited  For what he's heard  So far  But the phone  Keeps  Petering out on us  And again  I have to apologize  I'm sorry  Well apology accepted  Thank you sir  Now as you were saying  Are there  Is there a consideration  Being made  A special circumstance  Perhaps  And can I jump in  For a second  Because George 
[03:22:00]  You did say  That you were getting  A lot of people  Sticking up for Pat  And what  Emailing and calling  The IFO CE  We've had an enormous  Number of emails  Saying that he's  A great eater  I mean people know  That he's a great eater  He went to the big contests  Yes  Well we got one of those  Guys that's stuck up  For Pat  From Inaki  On the line here  It's Steve  Steve from  I can't believe this  Steve  Yellow  Oh Yellowstone  Steve from Yellowstone  Alright  You're on with  George Shea  From the IFOCE 
[03:22:30]  Oh my god  Hello  Is this Mr. Shea  Yes  Hi  I've been a big fan  Of competitive eating  And I just want  It just really seems  Like the whole  Sport of it  Has taken off  And become quite popular  Have you noticed  That the whole  The razzle dazzle  Of everything  Is really beginning  To pick up  In the public eye  Well I haven't seen that  It's sort of been  Steady in my mind  George Shea  Shea  And if we  Are you  The change  With  Robert Reed  Robert Reed 
[03:23:00]  Eating is not a competition  It's a way  To cover up  Monestation memories  Robert Reed  Robert Reed  Nathan has the same  Nutritional value  As the feces  Of a cancer patient  Wow  George  I'm here  Comment  I couldn't  I couldn't  Understand it  But  He was  He sounded 
[03:23:30]  He sounded  Very energetic  To say the least  Well clearly  This is an incident  That's produced  Great emotion  He's still on the  Again the phones  We obviously  Can't hang up  On  Pranksters  Either  Shut this  Coney  Jerk  Off 
[03:24:00]  So George  What  What can  We look for  As far as  Pat's future  Goes  With the  Organization  Well you know  I think it's best  That I email  Over a full  Statement  Oh  Well that would  Be nice  And that way  You can  You know  You can  You know  Review it  And see what  You're doing  But I gotta  Tell you something  Though  Pat is on the  Edge of his  Seat over here  Because the 
[03:24:30]  Whole rest of  It is full  Of junk  You ever  See his  Place  But he  Really would  Like  We have  Established  An independent  Panel of  Eating veterans  Which we  Call the  Baby bird  Study group  To review  The entire  Incident  And to  Issue a  Full report  Which if  You like  We would  Literally  Send you  A written  Report  Yeah  With  Recommendations  And we feel  That there  May have  Been a rush  To judgment  Enough with  The jokes  Were you guys 
[03:25:00]  Really offended  By the  Baby bird  Video  Well I've  Been around  For a long  Time of  Competitive  Eating  I found  It a  Little  Disquieting  I'm  Thinking of  Hiring  Al  Sharptong  Or Gloria  Olfed  Olfed  Sharptong  Wow  He's a  Funny guy  He used  Food references  With lawyers  Wow  Very good  How do  You not  Want this  Guy  To  Represent 
[03:25:30]  Your  Organization  Absolutely  Even though  Pat's more  Like Johnny  Bomren  What I have  Found most  Appealing about  Pat is his  Dancing  His dancing  Yeah  Well yeah  I think  The I  F  O  C  E  Needs  Pat  From  Winock  Yeah  Well you know  It broke my  Heart  Because I was  Involved in  This  And I  Will say  That there  Has been  In addition  To  Your  Listeners  Organization  Breaks  Hearts  What  What 
[03:26:00]  See  Get it  They eat  So much  Break  Heart  Reach  Yeah  We want  Pat  Back  In  All right  Well gentlemen  I'm going to  Email this  Over to  Your producer  That we  Hope to  Have a  Full report  And a  Final  Decision  In days  Because the  Issue is  He may not  Actually have  Violated  I think that  The panel  Suggested he may  Not have  Violated his  Contract  And the  Question is  Code of  Conduct  And they  Want to see 
[03:26:30]  If there  Are mitigating  Circumstances  They made  Me do  It  Well what  Are you guys  Going to be  Looking for  In the  Video  Well the  Issue is  The video  I think  The contents  Of the  Video are  Clear  The issue  Is  Does it  Violate  The  Contract  Which in  My initial  Reading of  The contract  It doesn't  But the  Question is  Code of  Conduct  Was it  Behavior  On becoming  An eater  And if  So  Did it  Warrant  A full  Expulsion  Or  Perhaps  A more  Moderate  Penalty 
[03:27:00]  I think  It was  His own  Time  You know  Sure  And since  It's his  Own  Time  There's nothing  Wrong with  A little  Vomit on  Another man  During your  Own time  And Pat  Has done  Nothing but  Talk up  The competitions  He speaks  Very highly  About them  He doesn't  Mock what  They're about  I mean  He's always  Had very  Positive  Things to  Say about  Them  Even though  I'm wearing  My  Contest  As we  Speak  He's very  Proud to be  A member  There's no  Question about  That  There's no  Question about  That  He's a  Good member  Yeah 
[03:27:30]  Well that  Is certainly  What would  Be taken  Into  Consideration  Guys  I'm going  To send  This over  And we  Literally  Will produce  A report  In days  That we  Will send  Mr.  I have a  Question about  The thing  Do you  Think  That a  Code of  Conduct  I mean  Like I  Understand  That every  Organization  Has to  Have one  And you  Guys do  Have one  Correct  Yes  So do  You think  That when  They say  Take a  Code of  Conduct  Do you  Find that  As the  Competitions  Become more  Popular  And the  Eaters  Become say  More  Verbose  Has that 
[03:28:00]  Made  Things  Like  You know  Like when  You go  Back over  The whole  History  Of the  Organization  Would you  Say that  That's the  Difference  Yeah  I'm sorry  Meaning  Meaning  That it's  Right  Yes  Why  You know  I've given  It a lot  Of thought  I think  That Pat  Is a  Great  Example  Of the  Evolution  Of the  Sport  He is  Wow  Because  He's a  Celebrity  Really  Celebrity  First and  Foremost  And in  Some ways  Almost  An  Eater  Second  Oh  Yeah 
[03:28:30]  Person  34th  But you  Know  There's a  Deep  And abiding  Love  Of Pat  Here  I mean  I think  You'll find  To a  Person  In the  IFOCE  Whether it's  On the  Staff  Or in  The  Members  They love  Pat  There's  No question  About that  How do you  Not  He's a  Lovable  Guy  All right  We'll send  Over a  Report  And I  Hope to  Have a  Resolution  Of this  Within  The  Week  Before  The  Weekend  Thank  You  Mr.  Shea  We  Appreciate  That  Very  Much  Thanks  George  There  Goes  George  Shea

[03:36:30]  I  Knew  That  She  Liked  Sex  Last  Weekend  We  Went  For  Dinner  After  Dinner  She  Wanted  To  To  Go  Back  To  My  Place  For  Well  As  It  Turned  Out  It  Was  The  Most  Embarrassing  Time  I  Ever  Had  All  Because  Of  A  Misconception  Some  Women  Have  About  Impotency  Oh  No  I  Took  A  Viagra  After  We  Got  Yeah  I  Took  A  Viagra  After  We  Got  Back  To  The  Motel  Hoping  It  Worked  Fast  It  Did  Its  Normal  Thing  And  Got  Me  Sexually  Aroused  But  Not  100%  Oh  Boy  He  Was  A  Little  Mushy 
[03:37:00]  As  Jim  Florentine  Would  Say  He  Had  A  Soggy  Six  The  Old  Soggy  Six  She  Knew  I  Had  To  Take  It  Because  Of  The  Prostate  Cancer  Killing  My  Prostate  Here  Is  Where  The  Misconception  Comes  In  Here  Is  Where  The  Misconception  Comes  In  It  Seems  that women who do not know about viagra seem to think if you take it you just get ramrodding  hard and they do not need to do any stimulation well that's just plain wrong well this woman is 
[03:37:30]  uh not helping out right men still need stimulation along with the viagra the drug is not a sack of  cement installer okay now it makes sense the drug is not a sack of cement installer god is that  terrific and and uh i was not about to masturbate myself in order to get it hard not in the  presence of a woman she wasn't willing to help him out she's fucking just expected the viagra she's  like come on old pudding prostate let's get going the guy the guy's fucking got a wet noodle yeah and 
[03:38:00]  he's not that's not embarrassing yeah the guy won't masturbate in front of her that's a little  might give it a few cranks see what happens get the fucking job done there billy bob guy's prostate  it looks like a rotted grapefruit and he's he's making demands on this woman suck it i'm not  jerking off fucking idiot billy bob is his stupid old man pride not in the presence of a gal a gal 
[03:38:30]  i brought her some silk stockings and she still didn't jerk me off world two reference no pardon me  you just showed you i don't like doing a high iq so as it turned out she turned  me off instead of on what a bummer it was so disappointing i had looked forward to our  meeting for some time and the possibility of finally enjoying good sex with someone  that likes sex i was trying i asked her if she'd put it in her mouth instead she put on her heels  and kicked me in the prostate  a good swift kick to the prostate if you can't fuck me i'll kick the cancer out of it 
[03:39:00]  what do you think of that billy bob stupid billy bob take that little piggy tail you call a cock and hit  the bricks fella tell your story walking tell your story no tell your story limping  tell your story fucking bow-legged limping that fucking just saw an awful prostate well let's see 
[03:39:30]  what this old broad has to say uh billy bob ends with all a woman needs to know about the drug is that  you do things as normally using stimulation together so please tell your readers what my experience was  billy bob thank you for sharing this experience viagra helps when there's a physical cause for lack of  erection as you know but it doesn't increase a bit uh libido sorry or substitute for all those  other crucial components of good sex that you and i and probably everyone reading this crave  touching kissing bonding stimulating each other physically and emotionally enjoying each other's 
[03:40:00]  pleasure as well as our own would it be funny she put something really like awful in there like  not realizing it yeah touching kissing fisting bondage nude nude pictures of children stimulating each  other physically  oh shit in this thing open mouth shitting right exactly golden shower roman shower brown shower  like a noodling laughing gay belching gay big gagging  gagging and puking oh 
[03:40:30]  uh it sounds like most of this experience was missing for you what a bummer i agree  i'm sorry you didn't feel you could communicate your needs and desires to your partner i don't  know maybe she would have been happy to help you get aroused if she had understood it's hard to  understand why she didn't seem interested in stimulating you just as part of the sex play  with or without the viagra since that car take half the bottle and crack her hip  snail her oh fuck him too he's not willing to yank his own awful crank you're the one with the 
[03:41:00]  fucking problem pal fucking be willing to work a little bit not in the presence of a lady  jacket well maybe she said i'm not i'm not gonna suck that thing not in the presence of modern  medical science he got himself into that predicament exactly she's fucking smoking cigarettes out of  his prostate all those years did in bed get the job done buddy uh since that's a good part of the  fun of sex i know you were too embarrassed to masturbate in front of her when she didn't help  arouse you but as a woman i just i find it very pleasurable and exciting to watch a man stimulate 
[03:41:30]  himself yeah as a woman i don't know if your partner would have reacted this way but i'll bet  she would have yeah because all of them want to watch a 64 year old guy just jerk off on the sofa  and you know she's old where they probably have the plastic on the couch and his asshole would  leave a sweat stain the little crank he's cranking it while his taffy balls are hanging  just a foggy like outline like the shroud of turin of his ass and balls what if the sofa was made of
