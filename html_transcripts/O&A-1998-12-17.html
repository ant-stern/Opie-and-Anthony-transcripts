<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the Iraq War, specifically the bombing of Baghdad.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, used crude humor to comment on CNN's war coverage, focusing on the "big penis building" and speculating about Saddam Hussein's location.  Their commentary also included sexually explicit jokes and references to the Clinton impeachment scandal.  They played listener faxes, one requesting a Scud missile be launched at them, and boasted about accurately predicting the Baghdad bombing in a previous segment.  Musical interludes punctuated the show, and they promoted their recently released CD, "Opie and Anthony's Demented World," highlighting its controversial parody of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer."

Red Peters, a musician and friend of the hosts, joined them in the studio.  He promoted his own CD, "I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies," and performed songs live, including "How's Your Whole Family" and the explicitly titled "Blow Me."  The conversation included discussions of Restaurant Records, their record label, and its owner "Owen Money," along with numerous commercial sponsorships, such as a cigar-of-the-month club and Super Libido, a male enhancement supplement which Peters was apparently using on-air.  The hosts also discussed their frustrations with their record label representative, who showed up with only promotional t-shirts instead of addressing the low sales of their CD.  The discussion frequently devolved into sexually suggestive and crude topics, including references to transvestites and the John Wayne Bobbitt incident.

Peters continued his musical performance with the sexually suggestive song "You Promised the Moon, But I Preferred Uranus."  The hosts then engaged in humorous speculation about Peters' fictional collaborations with various musicians and singers, all with obscene names.  Their conversation shifted to a recollection of their trip to Atlanta during Freaknik, describing it as a chaotic and potentially intimidating experience for white people.  The broadcast concluded with a call from "Lamb Chop," the sock puppet, who, in character, used highly offensive language to express bitterness towards his deceased partner and recount a negative experience filming a Hanukkah special.  The show also advertised an upcoming show featuring Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf and a Black Crows giveaway.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I hope I get a monica on this happy Hanukkah.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  What's up?  What was that in the CD player?  Hey man, Ralph Dettore ended his show with the Hanukkah song.  He's new here. What am I going to do? Beat him up already?  I hate that.  It's his first week. We've got to let it slide.  If he plays next week though, we're going to beat him up.  All right, what's up, man? 
[00:00:30]  Not much.  How you doing? Did you watch any of the war today?  Yeah.  The war show on CNN?  Yeah, it's kind of boring.  Yeah, it's typical Clinton.  You know, when Bush was in office, the war show was good.  The sequel isn't panning out as good as the original.  Well, you know sequels are never as good as the original, Anthony.  I know. Well, except for Godfather 2.  Right, that was very good.  All right, but Jaws 2, you know, the lethal weapons after the first one.  The Gulf War, the war show? I don't know. 
[00:01:00]  I like the original one where they showed the same infrared camera of Baghdad with the big penis building.  Which is still standing, by the way.  Still standing.  I guess there's no weapons inside the penis building.  I guess not.  That's probably where Saddam's hiding.  He makes it through every attack, the big penis building.  Just take out the penis building and you'll find Saddam.  Yeah, Saddam's in the big penis building.  But you saw the big penis building and all the bright flashes during the first war show.  And now it's like, you know... 
[00:01:30]  Well, there you have it.  Another raid.  Well, you know why? Because precision bombing.  Well, we had that back then, too.  But now they're saying we're even more accurate than back in 1991.  Yeah.  But Saddam just doesn't have the stuff anymore, I don't think.  He doesn't have as much anti-aircraft weapons.  He doesn't have the surface-to-air missiles he did during the first one.  I mean, he was all stocked up.  What about the Scuds?  Scuds.  I heard there's, like, one Scud left in the back of an old Iraqi U-Haul. 
[00:02:00]  And they're trying to move around the desert on two flat tires.  The Scud capability.  Israel bracing for a possible Scud attack.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  One of the best lines about the Gulf War back in 1991, it was from Sam Kinison.  He was talking about the Iraqi technology.  Yeah.  And he says that, you know, the Iraqis, they blow off these Scud missiles and then they turn  on CNN to see where they landed and where they hit. 
[00:02:30]  That's their technology.  Of course.  That is so true.  It's ridiculous.  But, yeah, now Congress is getting together.  They're going to go ahead with the impeachment vote.  Well, that lasted for a day.  That helped out Bill.  Kept the impeachment from being voted on today.  But, yeah, it's going to go ahead.  They're going to have some arguments tomorrow and then the vote on Saturday, it looks like.  I don't know where Bill's going with this.  Where is Clinton going with this bombing raid?  He's going to stop short once again. 
[00:03:00]  And what's the follow-up here?  Do you make the full commitment that we are not leaving until Saddam is removed from the  leadership of Iraq?  Well, that's what he's been saying today.  Well, how are you going to do that?  Good question.  And then he's talking about not bombing during the Islamic Holy Days.  Which is 40 days.  Yeah, that are coming up.  Why can't we bomb during that?  It's war, for God's sake.  Right.  Holy days don't count in war. 
[00:03:30]  That's why it's war.  There's no rules.  Right.  Oh, make the commitment.  Well, he says he's going to make the commitment, but can we really believe anything he says at  this time?  President Wiener.  That's the problem.  That's all I see when he's on TV.  And we have to show Saddam Hussein that.  And I'm just like, my Wiener.  My Wiener.  Hey, it's my Wiener.  All right.  Well, we're ready to rock today.  We're not going to bitch as much as we did yesterday.  Got a bunch of complaints from the faithful listeners.  Ah, screw them. 
[00:04:00]  I'll bitch if I want.  I kind of like when we bitch.  There was plenty to bitch about yesterday.  That's true.  We have fun, too.  Lighten up.  We did have some fun.  Lighten up on our bitching.  The Clinton Christmas songs were hysterical.  Very fun.  We'll be playing those today.  We're getting so many requests for The Grandma Got Run Over by Reindeer Song from the Demented  World CD.  Not the original, of course.  No.  Who wants to hear that?  Crap.  And everyone wants a copy of it, so let me look at the clock here.  We'll play it in the 4 o'clock hour.  How's that?  Then you can tape it.  Yeah.  Oh, we're back to infrared camera of Baghdad. 
[00:04:30]  Baghdad Live, 11, 18 p.m.  And it just looks green.  Yeah, there's just a lot of smoke and stuff.  There's nothing going on.  Come on.  They can't pull this off and make it look as good as the last one.  All right.  Well, we'll keep you updated.  They've got the TV on in the studio.  If I was somebody in Baghdad, knowing that CNN is showing all this, I would fire off a  bunch of bottle rockets out of my window just to make it look good.  Oh, my brother. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Fax line, 212-957-WNEW.  The instant feedback is all set and ready to go.  If you're online, drop us a note.  Just go to the WNEW website and click on our baby pictures, and you go from there.  Okay?  On the way, we've got some ZZ Top, some Stone Temple Pilots, and Kenny Wayne Shepard next.  Anthony, I've got our first fax of the show today.  All right.  It says two words.  Pork man.  Can you bring a little more specific, please?  Pork! 
[00:05:30]  All right.  Here's Kenny Wayne Shepard.  This is Blue on Black.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Interstate Love Song from Stone Temple Pilots.  Don't forget, beginning tomorrow and all weekend, we've got the latest box set from the Black  Crows.  Plus, we've got a chance for you to fly to Atlanta to see them live.  The winning starts tomorrow at 10 a.m. on that one.  Okay?  Oh, I hope I got an instant feedback here from Josh.  And he says, I wish I could have taken a bet yesterday when Anthony said at least one 
[00:06:00]  major newspaper would have a picture of the penis building from Baghdad.  Needless to say, no penis pictures.  Well, I don't know.  The picture on the, um...  Let me see.  Which one?  I got a news day, but it's kind of dark.  It's too dark is the problem.  I think that's the penis building in the background.  You know, I got to be honest.  I don't think it is.  Really?  What about the daily news?  Yeah.  Where's the daily news?  Do you have it over there?  Yeah, I got it over here, actually.  Take a look, because I can't believe that one paper at least didn't put the penis building 
[00:06:30]  on the cover.  Oh, no, huh?  Oh, no.  What's wrong with these papers?  It's the universal signal of Baghdad.  The penis building.  No.  The post really blew it.  What is that supposed to be?  What is that?  What is that?  It's just black.  Yeah.  Oh, and it's supposed to be a picture of the city in the back there.  That's what it's supposed to be, the penis building.  That's what I'm assuming.  I don't know.  Well, Josh, you're right.  Okay.  All right, Josh.  I blew it again.  So we didn't call that one.  Wow, my bets. 
[00:07:00]  I lost a bet.  We were the only radio station in New York that called the bombing yesterday.  To the hour.  Everyone else is doing their music sweeps and giving away Furby dolls, and we went on  the air and said that we're bombing Baghdad within the hour.  That's right.  One guy writes us an instant feedback and says, man, where do you guys get your information  from?  The CIA?  I mean, we all knew that it was going to happen.  Of course.  But we put our necks on the line, Andy.  Oh, sure.  That really put our neck on the line. 
[00:07:30]  Being the journalist that we are.  Yeah, we don't want to come out with something that isn't really going to happen.  No.  Yeah, we wouldn't do that.  All right.  On the way, we got Metallica doing Turn the Page and some Zeppelin 2.  102.7 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Metallica.  Turn the Page from Garage Inc.  Those guys make a scary-ass video.  Yeah.  Have you seen the video to Turn the Page?  Yes, I have.  What is that?  Ginger Lynn, ex-porn star? 
[00:08:00]  Is that who that is?  It's Ginger, right?  Mm.  By the end of the video, she's getting beat up in a cheap hotel.  It's like, oh.  She's a dirty girl.  I thought it was a happier song than that.  I thought it was about a guy who's on the road.  He's a little lonely, but he's, like, having a good time and partying and stuff.  Well, that's their interpretation of it.  They interpret things a little differently.  That's okay.  Hey, can't they ever work out that damn delay over to Baghdad?  How many screw-ups did you see last night of the anchor guy trying to talk to their reporter in Baghdad? 
[00:08:30]  And they're just stepping on each other.  It's like a three-second delay.  I love when they ask the question, and you just see the person just waiting.  He just stands there.  So, how does Baghdad look tonight?  Well, I just...  Well, I just...  Ugh.  That's exactly what's going on over there, right?  It's hysterical.  Just shut up and let the guy finish.  Larry King was talking to somebody, and he was stepping all over.  Yeah.  He was talking to her, Christine Amapour, who was ever over there. 
[00:09:00]  And just stepping on her.  Here's Dave.  How's it look?  Well, Larry, it's...  Have Dave's comp...  Larry?  Calm down.  Are you...  Have Dave's calmed down there?  As you can see, I'm on...  Building...  Does it look like it's...  It's a mess.  Get that figured out.  I just love the blank stare the reporter gives as they're waiting, and there's like three  seconds of uncomfortableness, and like a dog when you play a whistle. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And the head tilts, man.  What, Larry?  What did you say, Larry?  I didn't hear you.  Oh, too much fun.  All right.  What are we doing here?  I think we can play some more rock and roll for you guys.  Yeah, let's rock.  It's a rocking day.  Yes, it is.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  Okay.  What is Pepsi One, Anthony?  Opie, it's a one-calorie cola that doesn't taste like a diet cola.  You've got to be kidding.  I'm not...  Would I kid you? 
[00:10:00]  You've never kid me in the past.  That's right.  Okay, Pepsi One.  Who is it for, Anthony?  Okay, anyone who views diet cola as a compromise.  Now, what do you mean by that?  I mean, say you have to lose some weight.  Maybe.  Uh, you can't drink sweetened cola.  It's cola sweetened with sugar.  So you go to a diet.  And what happens?  You're compromising.  Because they taste like crap.  Mm-hmm.  Then you turn to Pepsi One.  It's got a brand new sweetener.  What does it taste like?  It tastes pretty damn good. 
[00:10:30]  It tastes like cola.  I was pretty surprised that it's a diet cola.  You can drink it without thinking, oh, I'm drinking something with one calorie.  Okay.  That's it.  Where do they get Pepsi One, Anthony?  Go to every store.  You'll find that.  Really.  Let me put it in terms you can understand.  If you're a fat slob that's got to lose weight, or if you're just a skinny guy or a skinny gal that wants a good tasting cola with one calorie. 
[00:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  Try Pepsi One.  Pepsi One.  It's Pepsi One, everyone.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Live Rush, the spirit of radio.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Want to send a fax today, 212-957-WNEW.  We're getting some good ones today, Anthony.  Yeah.  This one reads, drop a Scud missile on Opie and Anthony.  Drop a Scud missile on Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Rebuild, uh, rebuild WNEW with Dave Herman and Scott Muni. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Rebuild?  Rebuild.  All right.  That's, uh, kind of impossible.  Uh, the changes that have taken place at NEW are a big mistake.  Liked my rock and jocks the old-fashioned way.  Hey, they can be old-fashioned way.  A long-time listener, and he's got long, underlined, a lot.  He's a real long-time listener.  I guess so.  Well, don't worry.  You've got only a few weeks, and then you could, uh, listen to the Scott Muni siesta on 
[00:12:00]  2104.  Mm-hmm.  That'll be a lot of fun and exciting radio.  Sure.  And I'm sure they'll probably, uh, hire, you know, Dave Herman soon.  They're hiring all the has-beens over there.  Let's see.  Uh, Opie and Anthony, guess what I heard?  What are you laughing at?  You.  Just tell me like I seem to.  Of course.  Uh, Opie and Anthony, guess what I heard?  Hillary Clinton's, uh, gay.  You always see her with that dark-haired lady.  That's the word around town. 
[00:12:30]  Have a good day, Bonnie.  That dark-haired lady?  Who's the dark-haired lady?  I don't know who that is.  All right.  Let's try this one.  Can you please wish my girlfriend, Gail Rudolph, uh, happy birthday?  She's a big fan of the show.  She listens between three and five.  No.  No, we cannot do that.  No.  Okay.  That's great.  That's our faxes today.  Keep them coming.  Hey, you know what I hear, though?  Huh?  I hear you're getting a new mailbox.  Yeah, I am. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We get, we, when we first came here to NEW, we had the mailboxes way at the bottom because  obviously they had, uh, the older staff here for many years.  Mm-hmm.  And they had rated to get the top mailboxes in the mailroom.  That's what goes on around here.  Yeah.  Instead of doing good radio, it's, uh, it's how long you've been in the building.  Yeah.  So if you've been in the building 30 years, you get the big mailbox.  You get the big mailbox that fits a lot of stuff.  So I moved up to the big mailboxes, I think, a month ago.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And now you, Opie, are getting the Muni mailbox. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah!  You have just been informed that you are getting the Muni mailbox.  Now, where is the Muni mailbox?  In the mailroom.  Okay.  I'm going to have to maybe go in there and, uh, see what's in there for you.  Well, we got to empty out his mailbox.  Yeah, we'll empty it out.  Take over his mailbox.  And then maybe do a little exorcism.  I feel, I feel honored to have his mailbox at this.  All right.  Cool.  Then we'll, we'll have to, uh, investigate what's in there.  Is there a phone in the mailroom?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll call from the mailroom and, uh, see what's in his mailbox. 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  Also, I'm hearing rumors that Lamb Chop might be calling in tonight?  Yeah.  Lamb Chop, I think, is calling in to plug some, uh, Hanukkah special that's on Channel 13 tonight.  All right.  We haven't heard from Lamb Chop in a while.  No.  That'd be fun.  Hanukkah special.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Okay.  And also, a lot of people calling in for the Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer song.  The Demented version from our CD, Opie and Anthony's Demented World.  Yeah.  And, uh, a lot of people still having a hard time finding that CD and time for a holiday. 
[00:14:30]  I don't blame you.  So, what we're going to do is we're going to play it in about 15 minutes so you can get  a tape of it and play it for your family and friends.  Okay?  Very good.  So, if you've been patiently waiting to tape that, stick around.  Hey, are you still searching for the ultimate holiday gift, are you?  Mm-hmm.  Well, look no further.  It's a monthly cigar membership from Cigars Around the World, the original Cigar of the Month  Club.  This is a perfect gift idea for the cigar aficionado in your house.  Yeah, this is very cool.

[00:16:30]  Ben, what are you bringing in?  Hey, Ben.  How you been, man?  Everyone wants to know how Ben the fag is doing.  I swear to God, we're getting so many calls about Ben the fag.  He's not a fag.  What are you bringing in?  He's not a fag.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Wait, it's a package from our agent.  Is it really?  Yeah.  This is the first time we've heard from him since we've gotten here.  So have you gone home with any transvestites lately? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Transsexuals.  Transsexuals?  I'm sorry.  That's right.  They still have their penis.  You opened your package?  What are you, crazy?  All right.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah.  10% of my pay, and I get pretzels and popcorn.  Thanks.  No, really, Grant.  That's great.  A little gift package.  Oh, hey, there's gummy candy in here, too.  That's cute.  That must have cost $2.50.  Thanks.  That's great.  Thanks.  Thanks for the effort.  Thank you.  Appreciate it. 
[00:17:30]  Now pick up the phone and give us a call.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right.  What were we going to talk about?  Now I forget.  Oh, we've got to play the grandma song here.  Everyone is sitting by.  They want to get a tape of this.  Anthony?  All right.  See, the agent could help us distribute our Dementor World CD, because obviously our record  company has decided to blow us off.  Oh, of course.  See, an agent will put the heat on and get things done for you and I.  I'm too busy getting together these gift packages.  Cropcorn and pretzels? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  There's something in there.  All right.  Well, thanks.  Anyway, a little Christmas ditty.  Got to give my brother credit for this one.  Yes.  Can't take it.  Brother Joe wrote this.  Yeah.  Well, I was going to talk about grandmas real fast.  Oh, yeah.  Because the holiday season is upon us and I love my grandma.  You finally see grandma again from last year.  Yeah, pretty much.  I see my relatives once a year.  They all get together.  I mean, I love my grandma, but aside from a holiday, when you go over there, where are you 
[00:18:30]  going to go over there to talk about?  Not much.  You sit down.  Hi.  How you doing?  But my grandma's cool.  Last year, she has 30 grandkids and I don't know, about six or seven great grandkids.  She gave us all lottery tickets last year.  Oh, really?  Now, that's a cool gift, right?  Instead of a stupid pair of gloves or something that you're never going to use.  What?  Yeah, but my grandma's cool.  It's like, oh, no.  My grandma's not cool.  Hell, yeah.  She's cool. 
[00:19:00]  My grandma's good.  It's like the girls that talk about their cats.  My cat's different than every other cat.  No, honey, it's still a cat.  No, man.  It's like, oh, it's, my grandma still goes to Atlantic City and gambles.  She's 88 years old.  She's still cool, I'm telling you.  She shows up at, you know, our Christmas party.  Yeah.  With a t-shirt that says, Grandma got run over by a reindeer and there's like a hoof print  up her whole body and stuff.  She's got a sense of you.  Oh, come on.  She's 88. 
[00:19:30]  She's trying.  I get it.  She's trying it.  She's still asking how, you know, junior high is?  No, she's pretty, she's pretty with it.  I got a few ants that get my information all wrong.  So, so how's Buffalo?  Buffalo?  Turn on your radio.  I'm on, I'm on in New York now.  Still going out with that girl, Christine?  No.  Dumped that bitch about five girls ago.  Hey, how's that on the cord?  You just bought that, right?  No, I bought that in 1986. 
[00:20:00]  I remember my, my grandma on my father's side, God rest her soul.  She's not with us any longer, Opie.  But me and my brother had to be in our early 20s and she's giving us Christmas presents,  little marionettes.  She, she would bring us things like we were eight frigging years old.  It's just, oh God, what, why bother?  That's pretty cool.  No, it's not.  It's sad.  It's just sad. 
[00:20:30]  So what do you do with the gifts after you leave the party?  I don't know.  You just got to put them in the closet.  It's embarrassing when you open it up and it's like, oh gee, that, yeah, see, you could,  you know, have them play with each other.  And I got, I got some, I got some relatives I see every year.  I say one thing to them.  Hey man, can you move your car?  I got to go.  You're blocking me in.  That's about all I say to him.  We all get together and stuff and I see him once a year, but also I was like, hey man,  we're leaving.  Can you move your car?  Yeah, there's a couple of those. 
[00:21:00]  That's the truth though.  All right.  So you want to play this thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little ditty.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Kiss from Psycho Circus.  You wanted the best.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, on the way today, we got our pal Red Peters coming in.  Yeah.  We haven't had him on the air down here yet.  No, very good friend of ours when we were at another station.  Yeah, we've known him for a bunch of years.  He's the guy that does How's Your Hole. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Family.  That's the guy.  And I think he's going to do that live for us today and I think he's also going to do  his Christmas song, Holy Ass It's Christmas.  All right.  So please stick around for Red Peters.  Who's bringing him in?  Someone from our record label because we're both on the same record label.  Yeah.  You can find Red's CD in all the stores.  Right.  You can't really find Opie and Anthony's The Men In World in all the stores yet.  We'll see.  We'll have to talk to them about that.  I don't think they're brave enough to send the big boys. 
[00:22:00]  No?  No.  It'll probably be like a Restaurant Records lackey or something.  Damn.  So we won't be able to confront them on why our CD isn't in the record stores once again.  I thought they were all lackeys.  Well, Red Peters calls the owner of Restaurant Records, Owen Money.  And we always thought it was just like a cute little joke.  Hey, I thought that was a joke.  Hey, Red, come in here.  Come here. 
[00:22:30]  He's in the hallway.  Oh, is he here?  Yeah.  Come on.  Come in, Red.  Hey, how you been?  What's up, brother?  Look at you.  All right.  Hey, Red.  What kind of t-shirts you got?  I've been looking these around for a day and a half.  They got Opie and Anthony's The Men In World t-shirts.  How you been?  It's a start.  Where's the representatives of Restaurant Records?  I don't know.  They're stuck in traffic. 
[00:23:00]  Red, they're stuck in traffic.  Hey, Red.  I know they're not stuck at the bank withdrawing money to give us.  Red, why do you have name tags?  Well, we're visitors.  Get out of here.  They gave you tags.  Visitors.  They're making you put name tags on.  Opie and Anthony.  Visitor.  This Iraqi crisis is getting a little out of hand.  Oh, is that what it is?  You got to put name tags on.  It's not unusual to get strip searched.  You got strip searched, Red. 
[00:23:30]  They give you the pipe.  The lady at the front desk with the plastic gloves.  The gloves.  Really?  I didn't mind, but the lady kind of.  Hey, Red.  We were just talking about the owner of Restaurant Records and what you call him.  Owing money?  Yeah, there it is.  See, we thought that was a joke for all those years.  I don't know what's going on, but he was supposed to be with us.  He says he's going to be here.  He's not going to make it.  We thought that was the funniest thing when you called him owing money right up until the  time we were under contract with him, under a recording contract. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe you can get the subtle hint, you know?  Yeah.  You were calling him owing money for years, and then we're like, ha, ha, that's really  funny.  Yeah.  But hey, look.  You got the T-shirts, didn't you?  Yeah, we got the T-shirts.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Yeah, he gives us some T-shirts.  That'll hold you over for a couple of days.  Well, Red, what are you going to do on the show today, man?  I don't know.  I got to rest for a minute.  You know, we got lost on the way here, and I'm going to go through my bag and see what  I can dig out.  All right.  We'll give him some time.  We'll give him some time.  Actually, let's play his track off our Domeno World CD.  He contributed a track to our CD, Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  We felt honored.  Babe Marino, right?  Yeah.  This is his auto dealership.  That's where he did the ad for his dealership.  Babe's here right now.  All right, Zopi, it's Anthony and it's Red Peters, who's enjoying our gallery magazines.  Yes, indeed.  We only put out the best for our guests.  I don't usually see this sort of thing in my travels, you know?  You know, I'm doing the, I've been asked to do the Lilith Fair, but I don't know if  I'm going to, I'm going to do it or not.  But, and some of the Christian rockers want me to do something, you know? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, really?  Sure they do.  Just, well, just sort of, I don't know what they're trying to prove, but.  Somehow I can't picture that one.  So, but you can with the Lilith Fair?  Yeah, yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  No, I mean, I'm.  As you thumb through galleries, girl next door issue.  Yeah, well, I mean, that's just, I wasn't, I was just reading the stories.  It's going to be the roast beef issue.  Well, this is going to be very exciting.  Red, in a little while, is going to sing a few songs for us. 
[00:25:30]  A lot of favorites on our program.  He's going to do How's Your Whole Family Live for us.  You're going to do Holy S, It's Christmas Today, Red?  If I can find one here that has the S word bleeped, but I'm not sure if it's bleeped or not.  I don't know.  Oh.  All right, we'll figure it out.  I guess we all want to scream with that word to say something else.  And then he's going to do the Blow Me song as well.  Ah.  Another favorite on our show.  For our president, I guess Tom Brokenjaw called up and requested it, didn't he? 
[00:26:00]  That's one of my favorite songs.  Tom Brokenjaw.  NBC Nightly News.  Live from Bagsat.  Tom, wake up, man.  The hardest thing in my broadcasting career ever to say was the Achille d'Oro.  Why the hell couldn't they be on the Queen Mary?  It had to be the Achille d'Oro. 
[00:26:30]  All right, stick around for the mess to continue.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Tom Cochran, Life is a Highway.  Anyway, it's Opie and Anthony and our pal Red Peter is in the studio today.  Right here with the Rock Buffet.  Yeah, that's...  You know what it is?  Well, what do you mean, Red?  What are you talking about?  You know, I'm pretty hip to the format.  What's this format?  This is classic hard rock, right? 
[00:27:00]  Is that what it is?  No, you were right the first time.  It's kind of like the Rock and Roll Buffet.  Rock and Roll Buffet.  Rock and Roll Buffet.  I like that.  Yeah, you know how it is when you go to a buffet.  Yeah.  It's a lot to choose from, a lot to pick.  Right.  You pass by certain stuff.  Right.  You personally might think it stinks.  But then the next thing smells pretty good and then you eat it.  But the next guy might think what you thought didn't taste good was pretty good.  Yeah.  Right.  Are we still talking about the same thing?  We've got to get a new liner for the station. 
[00:27:30]  1027 WNEW, The Rock Buffet of New York.  The Rock Buffet of New York.  That's a good way to explain it, I guess.  Yeah.  For sure.  Well, Red, we're still trying to figure out the music.  How's that for an answer?  Well, yeah, I think you're doing a great job doing that.  Okay.  And the contribution you make to the music is exemplified by your president, you know,  the standing there talking to you.  Well, thank you, Red.  Yeah.  What the hell did he just say, Anthony?  I think it was a compliment.  Okay. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, it was definitely a compliment.  Oh, thank you.  Well, we play a lot of tracks off your CD.  I laughed.  I cried.  I fudged my undies.  Appreciate the spins, fellas.  Congratulations.  You could actually find your CD in the record stores.  We're on the same label.  Yeah, we're on the same label.  But for some reason, your records are in the stores and ours are not.  Well, look, let's just go back a little bit.  All right.  Don't you have the T-shirts we just brought over here?  We got a bag of T-shirts.  We got a bag of T-shirts.  What are we going to do with Open Anthony's The Better World T-shirts? 
[00:28:30]  I told him, I said, look, what can we do for these guys?  I can't go there empty-handed.  So you brought a bag of our T-shirts.  Great.  Yeah.  I've been lugging them around for like a day and a half, you guys.  That's good.  Babe, poor babe.  No, really.  You sell, you know, 60,000 CDs in Boston, and we get T-shirts.  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's starting to pour in, the benefits.  The benefits are definitely coming in now.  Pouring in.  Great.  A little bit of light clothing. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, Red, you ready to sing a number for us here?  Sheesh, I'd love to.  All right.  You're going to do How's Your Whole Family Live?  Sure.  Is that even possible?  I'm going to try.  I haven't sung yet today, but I think I can do it.  Okay.  Sure.  The band is all set up in the corner here.  There we go.  Are you ready there, Red?  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Whenever you're ready, Chief.  Opie, How's Your Whole? 
[00:29:30]  Fine, Red.  Family, how's your whole family?  Anthony, how's your whole family?  Just great, Red.  Family, how's your whole family?  How's your whole family?  Family, how is your whole family? 
[00:30:00]  Babe, how's your dick?  Well, not too good today.  Tation Machine, how's your dick?  Tation Machine, how's your dick?  Tation Machine, how is your dick?  Tation Machine, everybody now.  Take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Take your pants down to the cleaners today. 
[00:30:30]  Take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Whoa!  Oh, look at Opie dancing.  I like this song, man.  He's doing like a jig.  Look at him go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Won't you do my ass?  Astrological chart, won't you do my ass?  Astrological chart, won't you do my ass? 
[00:31:00]  Astrological chart, won't you do my astrological chart?  Uh-oh, here we go.  Suck on a stiff cart.  Suck on a stiff cart.  Sail with me, sock on a stiff cart.  Sail with me, sock on a stiff cart.  Sail with me.  I think someone bleeped out that first line.  All right, everyone, come on, join in.  Even the listeners out there in traffic, whatever, let's go. 
[00:31:30]  Let's all join in.  How's your home?  How's your home?  Family, how's your home?  How's your home?  Family, how's your home?  How's your home?  Family, how is your home?  Family, how's your home?  Family.  Wow.  There you go.  All right.  Red.  Red Peters live in the studio today, obviously.  Thank you.  Off the CD, I laughed, I cried, I pudged my undies. 
[00:32:00]  That's the How's Your Whole Family song.  What line?  Line five has a question for Red.  All right.  All right.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  I'm going to beat my children because you played that song again.  What's the problem with the song?  Well, you've obviously impacted on someone's life through your music.  If the kid can just forgive me, you know, that's not the reason why I sang it, to see an innocent 
[00:32:30]  child get beaten.  Hi, N.E.W.  You've touched somebody.  Hopi.  Yeah.  Owen Money.  Oh, no.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Owen, this is Red.  What a time to be asking me, how's my whole family?  Well, what happened?  I got arrested.  You got arrested?  Yeah, I got one call and I'm calling you.  Well, we're going to keep you in jail.  Why?  Huh?  Why? 
[00:33:00]  Anthony and I want to know where our CDs are.  Yeah, where's our CDs?  Music Plan, Sam Goody, Tower Records.  Where?  Beirut?  Oh, they can call 100-270-2299.  They can get Red Peters and Opie and Anthony, and they can get a special.  You got T-shirts there.  I know.  We got the T-shirts.  So what's the phone number to order our CD and Red CD?  1-800-270-2299.  All right.  And if they act now, they can get it before Christmas. 
[00:33:30]  And what's the marketing plan for there on the Opie and Anthony Dementor World CD?  Um, hold on.  Let me look here.  No, but your sales, this was the biggest week you ever had in New York.  How many?  You sold 89 in New York this week.  Wow.  89 in New York this week.  And Red Peters sold, oh, I'm sorry.  Can I say this over the air?  Yeah, go ahead.  Red Peters sold 1,029.  Wow.  Look at that.  In New York? 
[00:34:00]  Uh, yes, that's correct.  Oh, man.  We see who rates in the record company.  Well, that's directly proportional to how many CDs are in the stores.  Reds, you go into a store, you go, where's Red Peters?  The guy goes, oh, right there, around that corner there in that section.  No, no, no, no, no.  That was sold just on the street corner in Manhattan.  We would even be happy for that.  All right, Owen.  We got to get back to Red.  Okay.  All right.  Owen, are you coming over or what?  Uh, call me. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  All right, thanks for that.  Yeah, he's not coming over here.  Oh, and money.  If we see you, we'll honk as we drive by.  All right, Red, you want to do the Blow Me song in a few minutes here?  Sure I do.  Have you ever performed the Blow Me song live on a radio station?  Never, not since the last incident, you know.  Is, uh, is it easy access out of here if we have to run?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  If we have to run?  No problem.  Well, radio stations get fined for playing the song.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and we're hanging with Red Peters this afternoon on the program. 
[00:35:00]  His CD is called, I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies.  We play like, I don't know, five or six tracks from this on a regular basis.  Red?  Yeah, that's what I've heard.  I've heard through the grapevine.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Big supporter of the Peter.  Right on.  Right on.  We've known the help I can get.  We've known Red for many years now, Red.  Many years.  As a matter of fact, remember a couple Christmases ago, I had that reunion with the New Christy  Hamsters.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  In Boston at the station there, and, uh, you know, you guys surprised me. 
[00:35:30]  You know, I was coming on around Christmas time.  I come in.  Yeah.  And who do I see?  I see the three New Christy Hamsters there, uh, Bruce, who was it, Bruce Godfrey, and  Raleigh.  And I looked at him, and I went, oh, forget it.  I got like, oh, I'm shielding, and I should, no, I'm not shielding.  But you pulled it together like a professional.  Hey, Red.  Hey, Red, can we have the number of your dealer?  You're seeing some good stuff, man.  Where can I score some of that? 
[00:36:00]  You're seeing hamsters and stuff?  No, no, no.  You know my song, uh, Holy Kick, it's Christmas with the New Christy Hamsters.  Right.  Okay.  And you know the premise of the song.  I went in, and they, uh, they effed with my head.  They taunted me.  They were, you know, uh, they were making fun of me, and, you know, they, you know what  I mean.  They, I just don't, don't like them.  They bummed me out then, and I said I would never work with another animal act.  And, oh, and money, listen to this.  Oh, and money.  Oh, and money.  Try to get me to do a, a duet with Babe. 
[00:36:30]  Uh-huh.  This last summer, right?  I said, look, no, forget it.  Okay.  All right.  So you sing songs with hamsters.  That's kind of cute.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe we can, maybe we can hear it later.  Well, you will play it, uh, a little later.  Thank you.  Right now, you're going to do a song that'll probably get us fined, which is all right by us.  That's good.  All right.  Why not?  Who cares?  Uh, you may recall, I recorded this with the Alan Pinchloaf Singers.  And, uh, and the great Babe Marino sitting right beside his orchestra, his orchestra, 
[00:37:00]  and, uh, with the help of Alan Pinchloaf.  And, uh, it was actually the first, my first tune that I recorded.  The first one that really took off for me.  Okay.  Really?  So, uh.  Has a Frank Sinatra feel to it.  It does.  Right?  Yeah.  And, uh, I think we could send this out to the president.  Of course.  This is, I hear he plays this, uh, he used to, before the trouble.  Okay.  And, uh, now he can't get away with it.  All right.  Without further ado, it's Red Peters, everyone.  This is very special for me. 
[00:37:30]  Hi, Dick.  Hi, Bob.  Pretty good, thanks.  You too.  Below me.  You hardly even know me.  Just set yourself below me and blow me tonight.  My hand, it would certainly be dandy, but it's not enough to slow me. 
[00:38:00]  You gotta blow me.  All right.  When you part your lips that way, ooh, I want you night and day.  When you squeeze my balls so tight, I wanna blow my load with all my might. 
[00:38:30]  So blow me.  Wow.  You hardly even know me.  Just set yourself below me.  You gotta blow me tonight.  All right, everybody.  Come on.  Blow me.  You hardly even know me. 
[00:39:00]  So blow me.  You gotta blow me.  So blow me.  Blow me tonight.  Yeah.  All right.  Red Peters, everyone.  Very good.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Well, look for somebody else here.  Three to sevens on N.E.W. starting tomorrow.  Another song that will be banned from our radio program.  Thank you, Red.  Hey, did you see my word sheet here?  Yeah.  What do you got there?  This is signed by John Wayne Bobbitt.  Oh, it is?  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Red, don't lose your head.  Sleep on your stomach.  John Wayne Bobbitt.  He made a little career of having his schlong cut off.  Check this out.  Look at that. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, and he puts a knife.  He underlines his name with a knife.  That's really his signature, huh?  That's the way.  Yeah, it is.  That's pretty cool.  I don't know.  That's something.  All right.  That's a favorite of his show.  I think Red has one more in him.  I got one more in me.  We'll do the Christmas song next, okay?  Sure.  It is the holiday season, Red.  That would be fantastic.  All right.  Stick around for Red Peters.  All right.  More with Red Peters in just a bit.  Everyone enjoyed that last one, Red.  Hey, thanks.  Okay.  That was good, man.  We got to explain our new club to you.  Yeah, now, what's that all about? 
[00:40:30]  We'll explain in a few more.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Live Pearl Jam, elderly woman behind the counter in a small town off there, live on Two Legs CD.  It's hoping Anthony and Red Peters in the studio, our pal.  Yo.  He's on the same record label as us.  We feel privileged.  He's the top gun at our label.  Yeah, the Titanic label.  We're all going down on it together.  You have the flagship album on the label.  Yes.  Who else is on the label?  Who else do we got? 
[00:41:00]  Actually, a very talented rhythm and blues singer.  Glenn Jones, yeah.  Glenn Jones.  Yeah, he's great.  He's excellent.  Who?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Glenn Jones.  Actually, he's very big down south.  Then he is to be in Sha-na-na.  Well, Red's CD is called I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies.  And unlike our CD, you can find his in the record store.  Congratulations. 
[00:41:30]  I want to know what deal you made.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Don't you need to plug a few things?  Pharmaceuticals?  Remember?  Pharmaceuticals?  Pharmaceuticals.  You know, do you mind if we plug a couple of things?  We get paid for it.  We need the money.  All right, go ahead.  Sure.  You know I have penis.  The external penis remedy.  I'm working on that.  No, because we're talking about the money.  I'm trying to, you know, make ends meet.  Right, right.  And we have, from Rouge Pierre, it's a cologne called JHS. 
[00:42:00]  I told you about this, didn't I?  No, no, no.  It's sent JHS, short for Just Had Sex.  It's a new man's cologne.  It's going over real big.  From Rouge Pierre.  Yeah, from Rouge Pierre.  And we get that, the Viagra stuff?  No, Super Libido.  Yeah, yeah.  Super Libido.  It's like a Viagra type drug. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, really?  It's a natural stimulant.  Okay.  Really?  What's the difference?  And you roll it.  No, no.  That's not it?  That's not it?  No.  This is in pill form.  Oh, oh.  You have to take it for a month.  Unfortunately, I'm on anti-Logino.  Let's forget about the pharmaceutical thing.  I'm mixing the products up.  Which I do, which is easy to do.  I don't know if that's ever happened to you.  500 bucks out the window, Red.  With this pill here. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, Red, how high are you right now?  So, you know, just normally, the normal amount.  You might remember hearing Red doing a lot of easy, wider, rolling papers ads on the radio.  Right, right.  There's a reason they picked him.  Let's just say that.  I was amazed that they picked me.  I don't know why they picked me.  But I was very, very excited.  You know, as you can imagine.  They took care of you, huh?  Yeah.  Sitting there cleaning your weed and the phone just rang.  You guys, you're getting t-shirts, which, you know, I have plenty. 
[00:43:30]  Thanks.  Yeah.  But, you know, they pay me in, you know, papers and...  Oh, that's fun.  Lighters.  Yeah, lighters.  Zippo lighters.  Yeah, and things you can't use, like clothing.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, just what I want.  All right.  You know, to get pulled over in.  Yeah, to get pulled over.  You know, you have an easy wider hat on.  Hey, officer.  What's up, man?  Officer, why the attitude?  All the paraphernalia. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, what do I do?  Hey, Red, we haven't talked to you in a while.  Yes, sir.  Did you hear about our new club we started?  No, no, no.  You know that Blow Me song you just played for us?  Yeah, right.  That's our theme song for our club.  And what's the club?  It's called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  And what is...  Every Tuesday, we encourage the ladies...  Yeah.  ...to give their man a little hummer.  Hummer?  Humming action, yeah.  Do we have any...  Have any of the stats come back yet on how successful you are?  How very successful.  I remember the Whip It Out Wednesday. 
[00:44:30]  The Whip It Out Wednesday.  Oh, Ixnay on the Whip It Out Wednesday, eh?  We'll have to explain that maybe when the weather gets a little nervous.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  That was very successful.  As a matter of fact, I still see people, you know...  At the Wows and stuff?  Sure.  ...knowing for the Wows, yeah.  That's on the way.  Watch for that.  Watch for that in the future if we're still here.  But we noticed a lot of people are miserable in their relationships.  They've been married for 10, 20 years, and the wife has...  They both have kids now, and the sex life goes down the toilet.  Yeah.  So we just said, look, guys, when you go home, tell the women about the Tuesday Night Hummer 
[00:45:00]  Club and have them induct you as a member.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, people started doing this all over the place.  Really?  They're doing it everywhere?  Yeah.  And the guys were happier and happier.  And did you see that little point where the stock market went back up after that big  dive?  It was right when we introduced the Hummer Club.  And I know.  It brought optimism to everything.  Which today?  Thursday.  That's what I thought.  Anyway.  But listen, seriously.  Oops.  We were saying today how happy people seemed in New York. 
[00:45:30]  See?  That's the reason, Red.  Part of the reason, I think.  We're putting smiles on everyone's faces, so.  That's fantastic.  Well, you want to play the Holy Assets Christmas song here from I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged  My Undies?  Sure.  Why not?  I mean, it is that time of year, right?  All right.  Are we going to be looking at a follow-up CD coming out soon, Red?  We're trying to clear up some legal problems right now.  But once we do, we're very confident that we will in the next few weeks.  We're going to begin working on a second album.  We already have all the songs in our head. 
[00:46:00]  In your head.  That's the only safe place for them right now.  Because if they come out of our heads, then you know what happens.  All right.  Obligation.  All right, Anthony.  Cigars around the world.  The original Cigar of the Month Club.  Great gift idea for Christmas, Opie.  Isn't it?  Yes, it is.  Do you know a cigar aficionado?  I know a few.  You do?  Yeah.  And wouldn't this be a good thing?  I do believe it would be.  And it's easy?  You don't have to go to the mall and park your car, walk through those crowded stores? 
[00:46:30]  You could do this right from your house.  Which is a pleasure, Anthony.  Oh, please.  For only $24.95 per month, plus shipping, Cigars Around the World sends five fresh hand-rolled cigars,  sends you a newsletter, a free cigar cutter, gift card, and more.  The cool thing is, if you don't have a lot of money or you do have a lot of money, they've got memberships that'll suit your needs.  Two to 12-month memberships available.  Just call 1-800-FRESH-66.  That number, 1-800-FRESH-66, and they guarantee that your gift will be there in time for the holiday. 
[00:47:00]  Well, that's good.  All right?  You don't want them getting there late for your cigar.  You want to wake up Christmas morning, unwrap your cigars, sit back, and light one up.  Light one up.  There you go.  All right, stick around.  We've got one more song from Red Peters on the way.  And Red wants the number for that other sponsor, Red?  Something about I came in late, something about hand-rolled something?  No, it wasn't something about some hand-rolled gifts?  No, it wasn't joints around the world, Red. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, he thought he was going to get, like, hand-rolled fatties sent to him.  No, it doesn't work like that.  Is that it?  No.  Oh, what a mess.  I wanted to do it.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony and Red Peters and Eddie and the hamsters in the corner that Red is seeing as he visits with us today.  No, I'll tell you, just hearing their voices again, it's sort of like an acid flashback. 
[00:48:00]  Really?  Well, I'll tell you, you know, I don't like, I don't know about you guys, I don't like getting embarrassed, you know what I mean?  No, no.  And have three little rat-fink hamsters, you know, make fun of you, make you look like a dick, you know.  It's embarrassing.  Of course.  Now, where do these hamsters live, Red, that you're seeing?  I don't know, I don't know.  They're somewhere.  I think they live in New York, actually.  Yeah.  They don't live on your person?  No, I guess.  Somewhere in my pocket.  I guess for professional hamsters, it's the only place you can get work down in New York, you know. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Right, Red.  Well, Red's on our record label.  The same record label as us, I should say.  His CD's called I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies.  And because of Red's appearance on our show, according to Owen Money, who owns Restaurant Records, which our CD's on with Red's, orders are coming in for our CD, Anthony.  Are you kidding?  Sam Goody's just put in a huge order for our CD, Anthony.  Really?  How many?  850 units.  Whoa! 
[00:49:00]  That could help us out if you're trying to find Open Anthony's Menor World CD.  Wonderful.  Tower Records in Carl Place just put an order in, Anthony.  All right.  Uh, Record Town Stores just put in an order.  I like that.  Wow, I feel like we're getting a tote for Jerry's kids.  Right, right.  And McDonald's coming in with a million dollars, Jerry, for your kids.  That's fantastic, fellas.  I'm proud of you.  And I just found out we have an 800 number for your CD and our CD.  That is correct.  1-800-270-2299. 
[00:49:30]  Mm-hmm.  And then he puts on here that to order Super Libido, and he's got a phone number for that.  I thought you were kidding.  No, as a matter of fact, I'm on it right now.  Now, Red, what is Super Libido again?  It's an, uh, I guess it's an, uh, well, that's what they're telling me.  I'm hoping, because I'm taking, I'm ingesting this stuff.  All right.  And it says something about a doctor approved on it.  I didn't, uh-oh.  My glasses, uh, I didn't need.  Dr. Kiborkian, probably.  No, no, it's, uh, the lettering is very small on the bottle, but it says something about that  it's good for, you know what, your, uh... 
[00:50:00]  Wait, it's on, wait, it's on your organs.  Just say it.  It's like Viagra?  It's like Viagra, yeah.  This is real stuff.  This is real stuff, yeah.  And, uh...  Super Libido.  I'm trying it, and, uh...  You're on Super Libido right now?  I'm on it right now.  Well, that explains it.  Wow, okay.  Really.  Well, the blood's rushed out of his head.  I see.  I am feeling, I guess I would call it a tingling sensation.  All right.  Oh, great.  And there's a room full of guys, so...  Perfect time to have taken it before coming to do our show. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, when that thing pops, could you, like, leave the studio?  I may have to.  I don't know, man.  Super libido.  So this stuff is real.  It's real, yeah.  All right, to order super libido.  The show's turning into one big plug.  An infomercial.  1-800-845-8694.  Yep.  Red is feeling a tingle.  Feeling a tingling sensation, I have to say.  I don't know if it's working, or maybe it was that chick that I saw yesterday.  He's blown up like a party balloon now. 
[00:51:00]  Going to make a giraffe head.  Luckily, I'm wearing my big package jeans right now,  because to make room for that super libido.  All right, Red.  You want to sing us out here?  One last song from you?  This is, you know, I'm trying to think of, you know, something that's topical and that sort of thing.  We have the space program and this sort of thing.  And this actually was used, although there was not a big deal made of it,  to wake the astronauts.  Oh, really?  Up in the John Glenn's mission.  Right, right.  Wow.  You know, shake, rattle, and roll, get out of bed, what do have you. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  You know, and this sort of thing.  And I guess it was Clinton's idea, I guess, to, you know, it was a little gag for the guys.  All right.  And what's the name of the song?  All right.  It's called You Promised the Moon, But I Preferred Uranus.  And again, this is with the great Babe Marino and his orchestra, with the Alan Pinchloaf singers.  You know, this reminds me of the Alan Pinchloaf singers, how privileged I've been in my career thus far. 
[00:52:00]  I've worked with some of the most fantastic people.  Really?  I mean, you guys, I think, with me, the show I did with the Hey Would You Blow Me singers.  Yes.  Yes.  Very talented.  Very talented guys.  And what do you call it?  Dog Named Stains.  I did that with Smelly Water and the Dickner Brothers, some of them.  The Dickner Brothers.  Ivan Heben, Youben Dickner.  Ivan Heben, Youben Dickner.  The Dickner Brothers. 
[00:52:30]  And I worked with the Joy Kingoff singers.  I remember, I never went anywhere without Joy Kingoff for many years.  Let's see.  Remember I did that rap song with Sir Scratch Your Ass a lot?  Remember that?  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  How can we forget that one, Red?  I was trying to think of somebody.  Fudgy Johnson.  Don't forget Fudgy Johnson.  Yeah, he was on that.  Fudgy Johnson.  What are we in third grade again, Red?  Oh, I know who. 
[00:53:00]  Remember I did the duet with Hugh Jorgen.  Remember Hugh Jorgen.  And I don't know.  There's some of the people.  Well, you sure have made the rounds.  Oh, remember Bob Frapples.  He was great.  He was great.  And I don't know.  I've just been very fortunate.  Very good.  So you're going to sing this lovely little tune.  This is You Promised the Moon, But I Preferred Uranus. 
[00:53:30]  You Promised the Moon, But I Preferred Uranus.  Because Uranus looks good tonight.  The moon was in June.  How it inflamed us.  A beautiful sight. 
[00:54:00]  And Uranus looks good tonight.  Hey, I'm not queer.  I'm just experimenting an idea.  The feeling's unrelenting when you're near.  That feeling starts extending towards your rear.  And ain't it clear?  I just want to phone you.  Have no fear.  I'm not full of bologna.  You and I could fly to Uranus tonight. 
[00:54:30]  This is a lady's choice.  All skate.  All skate.  All skate.  Reverse.  Groovy.  Yeah, that's a great Peter and Anus song guitar.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:00]  And I do.  Oh, yeah.  When you're near.  That feeling starts extending towards your rear.  And ain't it clear?  And ain't it clear?  I just want to phone you.  Have no fear.  I'm not full of bologna.  You and I could fly so high in the sky, in the night.  Well, all right.  Yeah, you buy it.  You and I could fly.  You and I could fly so high.  You and I could fly to Uranus tonight. 
[00:55:30]  Tonight.  Yeah.  We'll fly so high in the sky.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, man.  Woo.  There's Red Peters off the CD.  I laughed.  I cried.  What's my name?  You should have been a Rat Packer, man.  Oh, man.  I'll tell you.  You're a mess.  You should have been a Rat Packer.  I'm just hoping that maybe I can catch the wave on the swing thing, you know? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  Something's swinging.  I think you're right.  It's that super libido.  Bravo, Red.  I like that song.  Well, Red, it's always a pleasure when you stop on by.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  When you're back in New York.  I'll be back.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We definitely appreciate it.  FU Friday is tomorrow. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  Make sure you get your FUs in early.  Ralph DeTorre is on before us.  He'll make sure he stacks up the pile of FUs so you can send them early if you like.  Fax line is 212-957-WNEW.  Also tomorrow, the winning begins with the Black Crows thing.  All weekend long, you've got chances to win the Black Crows box set.  And we're going to have a grand prize winner that we're going to fly to Atlanta to see the Black Crows live.  That is very cool.  Atlanta, huh?  Hotlanta.  Go to Atlanta.  Goddamn.  You know, we went to Atlanta a little while. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  When we got fired and stuff, we were being flown all over the country for gigs.  Yeah.  Like you interview with radio stations.  Right.  And they fly you in and, you know, hang out.  And we flew into Atlanta during Freaknik.  Freaknik.  Freaknik.  Yo, gee.  Freaknik is a bunch of black students from various colleges go to Atlanta and party. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  And it is just the biggest crowd you've ever seen.  If you're white, it scares the crap out of you.  Yeah.  It closes down the city.  Yeah.  And, you know, the locals were telling us that they are scared S-less.  They close their shops.  They board up their windows.  No joke.  This is what they told us down there.  And there's a bunch of these Southern people.  I remember when we got on the plane to leave.  Yeah.  I was sitting next to some white guy.  And he turns to me and goes, you getting out too, huh? 
[00:58:00]  We were booked on this flight.  This guy was fleeing Atlanta.  There are a little more races down there than up here in the north.  He was fleeing Atlanta because of Freaknik.  But it's crazy.  All of a sudden, you'll be driving down the street.  And a car in front of you will stop.  And girls and guys will just start getting out and dancing on top of the car.  Yes.  And you're like, oh, you can't beep.  Well, they showed a special on Freaknik on MTV.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  Cars will just stop in the middle of the roads. 
[00:58:30]  And they'll just, they have these huge, like, boom boxes.  And they'll just crank the music and start dancing around in the middle of the highway.  And what are you going to do?  Excuse me.  Could you get out of the way?  Hello?  It's a big mess down there.  The locals want Freaknik to go away.  But it brings in so much money for the economy down there.  They don't know what to do.  Yeah.  That was our little trip to Atlanta during Freaknik.  So we decided not to go to Atlanta.  So you guys are stuck with us.  Yeah.  The funny thing is, when they were trying to sell Atlanta on us, Anthony and I are truly 
[00:59:00]  from New York.  A lot of people still think we're from somewhere else.  But we're not.  We were born and raised down here.  That's a long time.  And they knew we wanted to go to New York bad because it's like going home.  Mm-hmm.  So they tried to tell us that Atlanta is just like New York.  Ha-ha.  Yeah, right.  So Anthony and I would go into the local gin mills to see what was going on.  Yeah.  There's no bars like that up here, Anthony.  No.  Well, Atlanta itself was very urban.  Mm-hmm.  But not like New York. 
[00:59:30]  No way in hell.  The second you leave and you're on the outskirts, it was like you say.  We walk in a bar and you,  Hey, y'all must be from the city, huh?  You stupid northerners?  Northerners.  Concrete walking city boy.  You, you're just a, a stupid city folk, ain't you?  You automobile driving.  Mm-hmm.  Concrete walking.  You, you, you, you gap wearing. 
[01:00:00]  Look at you.  Concrete walking.  Living in a house with no wheels person.  And we're like, oh yeah, this is just like New York.  Boy, I, I could get right on the air and sound like I, I'm from here.  Yeah.  And the New York humor would really fit in, in Atlanta.  You made a joke about no teeth.  It's not very funny to me. 
[01:00:30]  So we didn't go to Atlanta.  No, we didn't.  All right.  Before we leave it, by the way, I must say, you never know what you're going to hear when  you listen to our show.  Of course not.  Yesterday we had a very serious political discussion about, uh, the crisis in Iraq.  Iraq.  Talking about the president and should we impeach him and the politics.  It was pretty intense yesterday, right?  Heated discussion.  I like that.  And then today you tuned in our show and, and what'd you hear?  Third grade humor.  Well, we like doing that. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  That's how life is.  We like to mix it up a bit.  Sometimes it's serious and you got to do what you got to do.  And then sometimes you hang out with your friends and get stupid.  Right.  We got to thank, by the way, Red Peters for stopping by.  Yeah.  All of ours.  Oh, I like the email we got.  Red Peters was hysterical, almost as funny as he was on Howard Stern yesterday morning.  Who's on deck for tomorrow?  Hank the Angry Dwarf?  All right.  I got to give you that.  That's pretty funny.  That is funny.  We can't help it if, uh, we're friends with Red.  I know.  Sorry.  Jeez. 
[01:01:30]  And if I was Red, I'd go on Howard first, too.  What kind of name do we have in New York?  Not much.  Yeah.  But you just wait.  You wait and see, okay?  And, uh, tomorrow, yes, Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf.  All right.  Well, anyway, on the phone really fast here is Lamb Chop.  Lamb Chop?  Yeah, Lamb Chop.  We haven't heard from Lamb Chop in a while.  What's Lamb Chop calling in for?  Well, uh, everyone remembers who Lamb Chop is, of course.  The Shari Lewis.  The sock puppet from, uh, Shari Lewis.  The late Shari Lewis. 
[01:02:00]  The late Shari Lewis.  And last time we talked to Lamb Chop, he was pretty psyched that the bitch was dead.  Wasn't that his exact word?  Something like that?  Something like that.  Yeah, it was.  He was a little bitter that for so many years, Shari got all the recognition and he was the  big talent.  Yeah.  That's what the whole story was.  Yeah.  But, uh, I guess, um, there's a Hanukkah special on tonight that, uh, he taped with Shari  Lewis.  Really?  It's an old special and he's stuck promoting it.  Ugh.  So he figured he'd call our show and, uh, and promote his lovely little Hanukkah special  tonight. 
[01:02:30]  We owe him that at least.  Hey, Lamb Chop!  Hi, guys!  Happy Holidays!  Happy Holidays!  Happy Holidays to you!  I hear you want to plug your Hanukkah special that's happening tonight, uh, on Channel 13?  Yes, yes, it's great.  It's a Hanukkah special.  Lamb Chop special Hanukkah.  Lamb Chop.  I, I thought you really wasn't into the Lamb Chop gig.  No, no, this is great.  I, I think it should be seen by all the boys and girls.  Hey, Lamb Chop, cut it out, man.  We got a tape of you saying that, uh, Shari Lewis is a bitch. 
[01:03:00]  Uh, I think the word I used was, uh, all right, look, the solo act hasn't been doing too well  these days.  Uh-huh.  Things are like that hag's fist is in my ass.  No one wants to book me.  All right, get to this special.  What, what can we see tonight?  Oh, well, it's, uh, great.  Eh, really.  Before Shari dropped dead, we pumped out this gem.  I can't believe I got a hawk this s**t.  I'm not even Jewish. 
[01:03:30]  My name's Artie Borelli.  I'm Catholic.  She had me wearing a yarmulke and spinning a dreidel.  In between takes, she's down in Minashevitz like it's water.  So by lunch, this tanked up witch heaves like a filter fish on my head.  After an impromptu sponge bath, this lush decides I'm gonna like the menorah.  Well, for those of you following at home, I'm a f**king sock puppet.  And this sauce to Betty's hand is about as steady as Richard Pryor's. 
[01:04:00]  Well, then the rag ass bumps into the candle and sets my fleece on fire.  And she's laughing.  The f**king bitch is laughing.  I'm burning.  God, I'm glad she's dead.  All right, well, catch me tonight on Channel 13.  All right, Lamp Chop.  I think I'm on after that homo Elmo.  He's gay, you know.  He's gay?  Yeah, he likes to fist up his s**t. 
[01:04:30]  All right, bye, boys and girls. </pre>
