<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The February 4th, 2014, Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts sarcastically addressing listener dependence on the show after their day off.  They transitioned to a discussion of the Super Bowl, with Opie claiming he'd correctly predicted the Seahawks' victory despite others' contradictory assertions.  This led to talk of a supposed (but denied by Opie) Super Bowl party at his house, fueled by rumors spread by E-Rock and Roland. Opie then recounted attending his son's school auction, where he was astonished by the high prices fetched for children's artwork.  The conversation shifted to SiriusXM layoffs, contrasted with the lavish expense of Howard Stern's birthday party. Jenny Hutt, a guest on the show, called in, describing her experience at the party, including meeting celebrities like Lena Dunham, David Spade, Rosie O'Donnell, and Dr. Drew.

The show then tackled the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, focusing on his alleged addiction struggles despite a public image of sobriety.  They extensively discussed Dylan Farrow's open letter accusing Woody Allen of sexual abuse, reading excerpts and expressing shock and disgust at the allegations.  The discussion concluded with speculation surrounding the story of shipwrecked José Salvador Alvarenga, questioning the veracity of his account due to inconsistencies and the death of his companion.

A subsequent segment delved deeper into Hoffman's death, speculating on the circumstances, the quantity of drugs found (estimated at 70 bags), and potential legal ramifications for dealers, referencing Alan Dershowitz. Callers shared personal experiences with addiction to various substances, including heroin, crack, and prescription painkillers.  The Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, was briefly discussed, questioning whether the Chili Peppers lip-synced and noting the absence of Flea's visible bass cable.  Callers mentioned Hoffman's roles in *Love Liza*, *Along Came Polly* (introducing the slang term "sharded"), *The Savages*, and *Flawless*.  Anthony revealed a recent dental mishap, with a tooth falling out during a prior show.  The segment concluded with the announcement that Pat Cooper would be a guest.


The post-Super Bowl discussion continued with Robert Levy, expressing extreme displeasure with the game and halftime show using highly offensive language.  They speculated on the evolution of Super Bowl halftime shows.  The conversation touched on Super Bowl commercials before Colin Quinn joined, offering his perspective on the game and sharing a personal anecdote about knowing Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Jerry Seinfeld's Super Bowl commercial and the absence of Tom Papa were also discussed.  Bobo then joined, suggesting ideas for an upcoming road trip, some of which were met with criticism.  Discussions about the road trip and potential activities, including a “movie star map hawker heckling fest,” dominated, including further celebrity impression and joke ideas.

Pat Cooper then arrived in the studio, launching into a vulgar and highly critical rant against Howard Stern.  He vehemently criticized Stern's personality, birthday party, and perceived lack of integrity, using extremely offensive language. He shared personal anecdotes illustrating his conflicts with Stern, Letterman, and other celebrities, criticizing his views on comedy, family relationships, and his own career.  He also criticized other comedians like Dice Clay. The conversation remained highly combative and emotionally charged throughout Cooper's appearance.

The final segment further focused on Pat Cooper's long-standing feud with Howard Stern, characterized by intense animosity and insults.  Cooper recounted past confrontations, alleging Stern was a bully who mistreated those who opposed him, citing Sam Kinison as an example. He criticized Stern's fans for blind loyalty.  The conversation touched on Jay Leno's Tonight Show run, the perceived lack of dignity in modern society, Cooper's family conflicts, and legal battles following a divorce. A bizarre anecdote about a woman burying her son in a Mercedes was shared.  The discussion also included Oprah Winfrey and Woody Allen. Bob Levy called in to support Cooper. The hosts discussed the fallout from Stern's birthday party, to which they weren't invited, fueling Cooper's anger. Cooper continued his verbal assault on Stern, culminating in accusations of being a "terrorist" and a "cocksucker." The hosts expressed amusement at the volatile, yet entertaining, interview, concluding the show by planning for the next broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Stop of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning everyone.  Time for another live show.  Yes.  Lucky audience.  Tuesday, February 4th, 2014.  Took a little day yesterday. A little day.  They were a little angry.  Yeah, were they?  Some people were...  Good for them. Go outside and do something.  Stop depending on us.  Holy fuck.  It's creepy. 
[00:00:30]  Are you fucking good? I can't even come in.  It's fucking creepy. Stop depending on us.  It really is.  Can you say that to me?  Yes!  I love a lot of different things.  So if one of my things isn't happening, guess what?  I move on to the next thing.  Something else, another thing.  And I don't tweet to people going,  Ah, where are you?  We pay your salary.  You get that one sometimes.  Really, do we?  My subscription price.  Shut up. 
[00:01:00]  Isn't it nice that we weren't here?  Because then it means you go and do something else?  You go see a movie?  Or go sledding?  It snowed?  Spend some time with the wife and kids?  Read a fucking book?  Do something?  Book?  I don't fucking know.  Get up on a podcast.  Play a video game.  Help a sick child.  Help a sick child.  There you go.  There you go.  See, he hates the listener. 
[00:01:30]  I talked to him.  Which message board?  Which one can I go to right now?  Well, they say it like a joke, but it's true.  Oh, yuck.  I'm only talking to an extremely small percentage of our audience, by the way.  Extremely small, yet fast.  Small.  Small, yet fast and vocal.  Because that gets confused, too.  Yeah.  I was just discussing the very tiny, tiny portion of our audience. 
[00:02:00]  No, he hates us all.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  And I'm glad we weren't here.  That Super Bowl was a fucking bust.  All that hype.  All that hype.  But you know what?  All that hype.  I think it set a record.  I think it's like the most watched TV event ever or something.  That is.  111 million.5 or something.  Why would that be?  It's different teams. 
[00:02:30]  Peyton Manning.  People wanted to see it together.  A young Seattle team.  I picked Seattle, by the way.  I finally picked one.  Finally.  Didn't you have...  You said Denver was...  No, I swear to God.  I think he said Denver was...  No, no, I swear.  You will not find tape of me saying the Broncos were going to win the Super Bowl.  I bet without even really much work...  This could be the first one I've picked in a long, long time.  Um, I bet...  No, man, because... 
[00:03:00]  You could find a clip that would save...  The one reason why I have such a horrendous sports curse is because I go underdog a lot.  Yeah.  I love underdog.  And not many people were picking the Broncos.  No.  I absolutely picked the Seahawks on this one.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think you did.  Do you remember?  Find the tape.  I'm kind of remembering...  Find the tape.  I'm kind of remembering you saying that the...  Find the tape.  The Broncos.  And give me a hundred when you lose.  Yeah.  Find the tape.  Oh, my God.  That hater thing. 
[00:03:30]  I just fucking threw out my voice.  That's my...  I wish I...  That's one impression I can't do that I want...  If I could do any impression, it would just be that voice.  Ooh!  That's extremely small.  Oh, yeah.  Percentage of the audience I'm talking to.  And then there were rumors I was having a Super Bowl party.  I wasn't having a Super Bowl party.  Last minute, Sam and Jess came over, and we had nothing for them.  Oh, Super Bowl party.  But supposedly, uh... 
[00:04:00]  Sounds like a shindig.  Supposedly, Eric told Roland...  I'm so sick of the bullshit behind the scenes.  I didn't have a Super Bowl party.  The Rock told Roland, and then Roland's like, oh...  Sam's nodding his head.  I'm a piece of shit.  So you're in on this?  Yeah.  I didn't have a Super Bowl party.  We ordered pizza in the first fucking quarter, and there was nothing to munch on.  That sounds like a party to me.  Pizza, there's other people, other people over the house.  Big game being played.  Yeah.  That's a party.  The Roland's like, I wasn't invited to his Super Bowl party. 
[00:04:30]  I couldn't make it through it.  I apologize.  I didn't invite you.  I didn't invite anyone.  I was unable.  I already committed, so I apologize.  I left the gun.  I kind of didn't want...  I just wanted to watch the game by myself.  Well, that didn't work.  Well, no, it was still all right, but...  I gotta make you feel good, Sam, right?  Well, I...  No, I know what it is.  It's...  It's...  Lynn...  It's Obi's wife...  It's the girls.  ...calling Jess and being like, oh, you guys should come over.  Yeah, they're good friends.  Because they're like besties.  Right.  Sam and I had nothing to do with this. 
[00:05:00]  You're basically...  You're the option to utter nothingness.  Right, right.  And he'd rather have the nothingness.  The nothingness.  Or it's a close call.  Right.  Obi and me live tweet sitting next to each other.  Oh.  Yeah.  And...  Oh, that's fun.  I play Legos with the kids.  Aw.  Yeah.  I was a little more social than usual.  I think so.  I'm working on it.  Than usual.  I'm working on being a little more social, so.  Yeah, but then I was confused because I got a text from Roland that was like, oh, I didn't  get invited to the party.  And I was like, what? 
[00:05:30]  Like, this is a party now?  I thought I was just tagging along with Jess.  It's a little private party, I guess.  But this is how all that bullshit starts.  Some people are persona non grata, I guess.  Yeah, but Travis texted me and he's like, I can't go to Obi's party.  Is he going to be mad?  I'm like, dude, he won't care.  Just tell him.  I feel like back to him.  I'm like, it's cool.  You mean because he was invited and couldn't show up?  Yeah, but he had already committed to answer.  So he's like, I want to go, but I feel bad.  I'm like, don't worry about it.  There's a bunch of fucking hens that work here.  Are they just clucking at each other?  They're clucking and there's rumors and speculation and it just grows and grows. 
[00:06:00]  So that's why I wanted to be like.  It's like E-Rock was the troublemaker.  I don't know.  But I didn't have a Super Bowl party.  Period.  Jesus Christ.  That's what you say.  Yeah, it sounds to me.  Pizza, people over, laughs.  People over, pizza, the big game.  That's a party.  I was actually debating going to your house, but the night before I was at an auction for  my kid's school where people were spending. 
[00:06:30]  Couldn't help yourself, huh?  No, never.  Blacks.  Oh, Jesus.  Blacks.  No, it's a bill.  Oh.  Oh.  And an auction where fucking people are dropping major fucking bucks on bullshit.  On what?  What were they?  Well, each class did a project.  And some of the projects were really nice because they had adult supervision.  Yeah.  And then it's like, here is this class's project. 
[00:07:00]  And it's like artwork.  Oh.  And one went for like $17,000.  Gold spray painted macaroni?  They've come a long way from when we were doing art.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah, yeah.  A long fucking way.  Glue doilies on construction paper?  They basically did a pollock.  Really?  One class basically did a pollock.  Like, you know, that fucking just throwing the paint around?  Yeah.  And I guess if he does, he's a genius.  But if four-year-olds do it, they're just idiots.  Just being kids. 
[00:07:30]  But I swear to God, it looked just like any fucking pollock I've ever fucking seen.  But that one thing, I think it went for $17,000.  Are you kidding me?  No.  That's what I'm trying to say.  What the fuck?  So my point, I was out a little late.  So then I was like, I'm just going to fucking sit around for the Super Bowl.  Damn.  17 G's.  My son's class, his only went for like four G's.  Uh-oh.  I was like, what the fuck?  What's wrong with our fucking...  Oh, no.  What's wrong with our fucking class project?  What was it?  Hand turkeys? 
[00:08:00]  It was like a fucking block of like tree wood with like the continents on it.  Oh, boy.  With string though and stuff.  It was pretty cool.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it was all right.  It was way better than anything we ever made growing up.  Yeah.  All of our stuff was the old hack kid stuff.  But these fucking people were dropping...  Like an ashtray.  They were dropping bucks for junk.  That was my problem.  Junk.  It went for a good cause, I guess.  I guess they give like one kid a scholarship every year and then they feel good about themselves.  It's like a lottery. 
[00:08:30]  Jesus.  They say they give a lot of scholarships out, but I've been in the school enough to know  which ones are the scholarship kids.  They're not giving a lot of scholarships out.  Oof.  But they're spending a lot of money and raising a lot of money for the scholarships.  Just so they can feel good about themselves.  Yeah.  Everyone likes feeling good about yourself.  What could we do, right?  Did you want to go to that on Saturday night?  It was kind of cool, actually, because I know a lot of the parents and stuff now.  How long was it?  I got to drink a little bit.  It was like three hours.  Wow.  Yeah, so...  But... 
[00:09:00]  Did you invite them to your party?  Hell nah.  The big suit?  Hell nah.  I would have bid on something, but it was nothing worth any value.  So I'm like, what?  I'm going to spend all this money and then take this project home and hide it with all  the other shit I don't like hanging up in my apartment?  Like E-Rock's Gifts?  Well, yeah.  E-Rock's Gifts is at my brother's garage right now.  Poster?  Well, it is a poster.  Or your Sugar Ray Leonard boxing glove, which is actually used to spar with it.  I might have to give those to the listeners soon. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Because I just don't treat them well.  No.  Give it to someone that'll appreciate it.  Someone will put it in a case and display it.  Well, I gave away my autographed Mike Tyson book recently.  Oh, you finally gave that away?  I saw some people begging for it.  Yep.  I gave it away.  Yep.  Actually read by the Opster.  Signed by Mike Tyson.  You should have signed it, too, because you read it.  You read it.  Read by the Opster.  Start signing other people's books because you've read them.  How bummed would someone be?  I think this Opie guy used to be famous. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not really sure.  Well, we know Mike Tyson.  He's a boxing legend.  But there's other autographs.  I'm not really sure about it.  That's how I felt when we were signing Jimmy's book.  Yeah.  I hate signing other people's shit.  I can't sign it.  It's Jimmy's book.  That was understandable.  No, it's not.  We were all together there.  It's so weird, though.  It was a way for them to get an autograph of all of us together.  But you put all the work into it.  It was a fucking amazing job.  And then it's like, oh, yeah, let me just write that down there.  Yeah, but you guys give me the audience.  It would have been a lot of work.  I would have been selling it to eight people if it wasn't for this radio show. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  So it was fair.  I hate to sign your book, but I made sure I made my signature a little bigger than yours, Jimmy.  Oh, that was fine.  You have a nicer signature than I do.  Mine stinks.  That'd be great.  You sign over his face on the cover.  Oh, we started doing that on lines.  Remember on lines?  I would sign it over Ann's face or wherever he does his face.  We were terrible with the signing of the autographs.  Screwing each other.  You know, because like I said, I'm so sick of rumors and speculations.  The other thing, thank God we have a radio show.  I, and I'm sure, I think I could speak for all of us. 
[00:11:00]  None of us sat around and listened to Howard Stern's birthday party on the whole level.  That was awesome.  Wow.  Holy fuck, you fucking losers.  That just like to start bullshit.  I bet you're listening.  Why the fuck would I listen to that?  I wouldn't listen if it was my own birthday party.  I don't listen to anything.  Who cares?  And then I threw a couple of tweets out there.  Oh, you're just jealous.  No, I was actually trying to go for a funny tweet, actually. 
[00:11:30]  Believe it or not, that's all it was.  That's all it was.  I especially love going after egomaniacs, so this was perfect for me.  A couple little goofy fucking tweets just trying to be funny.  That's all that was, people.  Yeah.  No, you did because you're just bitter munch.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  All out on the fucking table.  Yeah.  No Super Bowl party.  And no, I did not sit around listening to the birthday show. 
[00:12:00]  I heard it was a huge success.  Congratulations.  Congratulations, SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  I guess they also, what did they do?  They shut off On Demand.  Yeah.  Why did they do that?  Why not?  Wait.  Was it the pump up numbers?  Did they do that so everyone had to listen to that one thing?  Rumor had it they needed the bandwidth.  Because I asked about that because I do pay attention to the real listeners and they were  fucking pissed off.  So, I made some phone calls and they're like, well, we need all the bandwidth. 
[00:12:30]  That's what I was told.  Because I guess the On Demand didn't work.  Which was too bad for us because Friday we had a killer show and a lot of people wanted  to check that shit out.  Yeah.  So, that's what they told me.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  I think it's like to not give anyone else any options.  That's right.  You have to listen to it.  You have to, of course.  It's like when you fucking open your subscription, you have Channel One.  Right, right.  And it's just that thing over and over again.  I think it was to push everyone over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  And then, you know, whatever. 
[00:13:00]  What do you want to do today?  No, I guess I got to stick up for some fine people that just got let go.  Pretty much on the same day, they put a shitload of money into the birthday show.  People got let go?  Yeah, a whole bunch of jocks on like the 50s on, the 5s on 50s.  What?  The 50s on 5 and the 90s on 9.  What?  Got rid of more jocks. 
[00:13:30]  Any guys we knew or just Jim Carrey?  He's pretty much a legend in the business.  Oh, he used to be on 104.5, right?  Jojo Morales, Norman Knight, Jim Kerr.  Those are the big headline names, but I think they let go a bunch of others.  And they said budget reasons.  Uh-oh.  Which drove me insane knowing how much money went toward the guy.  I mean, it's great if you're him.  It's terrific if you're him, everything that's happening.  But for everyone else, it's not so good.  No.  Budget cuts.  They got rid of a whole bunch of guys. 
[00:14:00]  I mean, if they had a couple less limos to the birthday party, they could have kept these  guys who are really good at what they do.  I'm not a fan of the music jock in general, but these guys know how to fucking do it.  Yeah.  So.  I saw on Twitter, Jenny Hutt was there taking a lot of pictures.  I did see that.  A lot of pictures.  She is the worst brown nose.  Oh, is she a brown nose?  It's uncomfortable.  It really is.  It's uncomfortable that the people that just are begging for attention from Howard, begging. 
[00:14:30]  And if you know anything about the guy, he doesn't give a fuck about anybody.  You'll get nothing back.  He barely cares about the people in his inner circle.  You'll get nothing in return.  You think Jenny Hutt's going to be, you know, Howard's pal?  She was working that room, apparently.  She was sucking a lot of you-know-what.  Oh, man.  You see the pictures of her with everybody?  It's uncomfortable.  Poor Jenny is hanging onto this business by her fingernails. 
[00:15:00]  I don't blame her.  She's just, Jenny is, she's one foot out the door.  I'm just kidding.  What do you mean you're just kidding?  Yeah, right.  Who knows?  She's not making any money.  That's why she's.  Tell that to Jojo Morales.  Well, those guys are making some actual bucks.  Yeah.  That's why.  Budget cuts.  On the same day, they shoved a shitload of money.  That had to cost a lot, huh?  I was trying to do numbers in my head.  It's got to be just millions. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  In the end, it's got to be millions.  And then they have this come out that said these guys are being let go because of budget cuts.  Budget cuts.  Hey, I've said it many times, you know, it's their business model.  We're just fucking.  Long for the ride.  We're just a cog.  Yeah.  Wow, Sam Roberts, what are you going to be doing?  50s on five?  Yeah, you're going to pick up a couple more shifts, I guess.  A couple more shifts, some 90s channel.  Yeah, his voice is wrong for those.  Yeah.  For the 80s.  Here's Kajagoogoo.  That's perfect. 
[00:16:00]  Kajagoogoo.  And then the Philip Seymour Hoffman.  What happened?  Damn.  This guy loved, loved heroin.  Oh, my God.  Did he love it?  He loved it.  A lot of it, too.  He wanted a lot of heroin.  We're up to 70 bags they've found.  It was 50 yesterday.  Now they're saying 70.  Man, when you've got a lot of money.  He was all in.  A heroin addiction.  But the weird part is.  Matter of time.  They said he was sober for 23 years.  Yeah.  And a lot of people that just go out to dinner in New York know that Mr. Hoffman was absolutely 
[00:16:30]  drinking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw him at a place called Quality Meats.  And I was like, holy shit, that's Philip Seymour Hoffman at the bar drinking.  He was drinking.  Yeah.  And I asked the people there, because I go there once in a while, a few times a year.  And they're like, oh, yeah, he's here all the time.  He loves this place.  So when the.  He's always here.  But when the papers, you know, are saying that he was sober for 23 years, he wasn't.  No.  He was definitely drinking. 
[00:17:00]  This is a few years back.  So I could I could honestly say a few years back, Philip Seymour Hoffman was absolutely  drinking.  So I don't know what this 23 years sober and this came out of nowhere thing is.  Are they talking about heroin?  I'm guessing.  Yeah, yeah.  But Jimmy, Jimmy's in a program.  I mean, that's not that's not sober.  Not as I would define it.  No, I think it's it's pretty much any minor mood altering.  And people say, what about coffee?  Really?  Yeah.  They just people like to play cement.  Can you not see the difference between coffee and fucking drinking into a plow into a family? 
[00:17:30]  Do you really see no difference between those things?  Never had some espresso and then drove down the wrong side of the fucking parkway.  People just like to try to be clever.  It's like 13 year old Jim Norton arguments.  Ice cream's got sugar.  You're right.  You win.  You win the debate.  13 year old me.  I've never heard that before.  Even coffee.  Hold on a minute.  We'll get back to that.  Needy's on the phone.  Oh, no.  That could be one of fucking 50 people. 
[00:18:00]  Colin, what's up?  Lady Di.  Uh-oh.  Phones now?  What?  God.  What's wrong with the phones?  You dropped your mouse.  Why?  Your mouse fell down.  Why wouldn't the phones work?  When's Mars coming back for real?  17.  What?  Because whoever's setting up the studio doesn't know how to set this shit up and test things.  Is he taking every day till further notice?  I don't know.  Amazing.  Yeah, he's having a talent implant.  Thank you.  He keeps rejecting it. 
[00:18:30]  Jenny Hutt, everyone.  Oh, Jenny.  Hi, Jenny.  Good morning.  How are you?  Oh, Jenny.  Are your lips chapped?  Are your lips all chapped from the party?  Just smooching a lot of ass?  Yeah, you get the taste of Howard's ass out of your mouth?  Yeah, yeah.  You came across a bit needy in your...  A little needy.  In your pictures there, Jenny Hutt.  You enjoy a good celebrity photo, don't you? 
[00:19:00]  Oh, do you ever?  Yes, I do.  Yes, and we know that I'm needy, so that's already been asked and answered.  Who is the coolest picture you got there that you're happy with?  Lena Dunham.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Lena Dunham.  Sure, sure.  And actually, the only reason I met Lena Dunham was because Spencer walked me over.  I was invited by Rosie O'Donnell.  It wasn't like I had her.  Whoa!  Can she throw out any more names?  Look at her go.  No, I wasn't.  Whoa!  Oh. 
[00:19:30]  My point is I wasn't invited by the serious side of things.  I was invited by her to be her danger.  Okay.  Not only were we not invited, we were told to...  To stay away.  To make sure we stay away.  Even people that aren't on the air that is associated with this show.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, you can't come.  Someone said don't come.  What happened?  Was that bad to say?  Yeah.  No, I'm saying like they can't...  I'm not talking about you.  Oh, you...  Jenny.  We'll get back to you in a second. 
[00:20:00]  Okay.  He was trying?  No.  Iraq's wife went, but she wasn't allowed to bring Iraq because he's associated with this  show.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  His wife went, but he didn't.  He wasn't allowed because he was associated with this show.  What's he going to do?  Was he texting her?  What's happening now?  He probably would have enjoyed that.  He would have told every secret we have to whoever would have listened.  Oh, yeah.  If he had Gary's ear for two minutes, he would have just blabbed secrets. 
[00:20:30]  He would have gone to the party with a stack of resumes.  Oh, my God.  You had to hand them out.  If you guys ever need someone to call in about Doctor Who, we would do a Doctor Who break.  So where were we with her?  What happened?  Oh, well, she was just going around.  I saw David Spade.  She had a picture with David Spade.  So David Spade, well, let me tell you why.  Oh, story.  Years ago, a little bit.  I was in California with my husband, and we were walking in a hotel, and there was David 
[00:21:00]  Spade, and I saw him, and I couldn't control myself, and I said, I love you, I love you,  I love you.  It's a very appropriate thing.  My husband was standing by my side wanting to die.  A very attractive husband.  And David was, I think, horrified.  So I just went up to him, and I was like, here's a cup, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, wow.  I'm sure he cared.  Yeah.  I saw your picture with him.  Here's that.  Yeah.  There it is.  Here's that.  Little David Spade picture.  Who else does she have there, Sam?  She has Rosie.  A lot of pictures.  Of course, Rosie, her day. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  You got Donnie Wahlberg.  Donnie Wahlberg.  Who's that?  Who's the plastic face?  Is that Jenny McCarthy?  Yes.  Wow.  Is she looking plastic?  Little Jenny McCarthy, huh?  Jenny, you're looking pretty hot.  You are looking sassy.  Who's that?  Yeah, man.  You got some good TV makeup on.  How sexy is Rachel Ray?  Rachel Ray is fucking hot, man.  Yeah?  She's not good.  Her vibe is really sexy.  I don't see it.  No, I didn't either until I met her.  I'm telling you, it's an in-person thing. 
[00:22:00]  I was shocked.  I believe you, but I just don't see it.  Oof.  I was surprised to see through your pictures, too, that they allow murderers at this party.  What?  Who was the murderer?  Dr. Drew.  He was there.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Wait, what?  You know, the killer of celebrities.  First of all, I think...  We love that he's allowed to continue walking this earth.  Can I tell you guys...  Guys.  It's not amazing that he's still on TV.  It's amazing that he's allowed to walk free.  He's a free man.  Holy shit. 
[00:22:30]  Regarding Philip Seymour Hoffman and alcohol...  And Dr. Drew gets to be all over TV because of Philip Seymour Hoffman, right?  Yeah, the minute that I heard of the death, I texted him.  What, did you run over to the apartment to get a picture with the body?  Is that what you did?  Yeah.  Were you hanging outside, you tool?  You see her just thumbs up by the gurney with the sheet covering him, and you're smiling.  Did you try for that shot?  You know what I learned, you guys, though?  I learned that when they say 50 or 70 bags of heroin, they're not giant Ziplocs. 
[00:23:00]  They're little teeny tiny pill bags.  Oh, that's okay, then.  What are you talking about?  What's wrong with you?  They're little glassine.  They're like little fucking, you know, one-hitters.  I don't know much about heroin, but I would assume 70 bags is a shitload.  He's not fucking...  He's not trafficking in heroin.  It's just fucking...  Yeah.  It's for his own use, but that's a lot of your own use.  Even if they were single dosages, that's 70 dosages of heroin. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there you are with...  Who's that?  Sarah Silverman.  Oh, Sarah Silverman.  Boy, you sure like hanging out with the power ladies, don't you?  Jenny, did anyone say no or no?  Sarah Silverman is making a movie based on my sister-in-law's book, so I had an opening  opening with her, too.  On who?  On who?  What?  Sarah Silverman is making a movie based on my sister-in-law's book.  Who's your sister-in-law?  So I was able to...  Amy Koppelman, my brother's wife. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  Your sister-in-law's book?  It's starting to shoot like that.  Sounds awful.  What's the book?  Yeah.  What's the book about?  It's called I Smile Back.  It's about a housewife who's destructive, self-destructive, and fooling around, and  blah, like just a lot of drama.  It's sad.  Wow.  I'd rather see the bridges of Madison County.  Is she filming for Lifetime?  Yeah.  Was that a Lifetime movie?  No.  No, a real movie.  But Sarah Silverman's attached to the lead.  So I was able to say hi to her because of that. 
[00:24:30]  She's got so many catchphrases and a little industry inside.  I love that she's justifying every picture.  Jenny Hutt.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Natalie Maines.  Oh, she used to be in the Dixie Chicks.  Oh, okay.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I geeked out of her.  More like the Dykesy Chicks.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice, right?  Here's some good ones, Jenny.  Fucking Jenny is exactly what I would have done.  Oh, yeah.  Jenny takes a good selfie, too.  I take a fucking horrible one.  You do a good selfie.  She does. 
[00:25:00]  Did Lena Dunham do everyone a favor and keep her clothes on for this thing?  Aw.  She loves getting naked on TV.  Well, and we don't love seeing it.  No, huh?  No.  She's kind of a flatsoe, right?  Well, but everyone will talk about how courageous and sexy she is.  She's sexy.  She's sexy.  By the way, I don't think it's freeing.  I think it's good for her.  What?  Good for her.  I think good for her.  I would never do that.  Why good for her?  I don't understand that. 
[00:25:30]  I don't understand that.  Why?  Because she's so secure she could do that.  Oh, God.  That's exactly what we're talking about.  Nah.  She's comfortable in her own skin.  There's so much of it.  Yeah, I don't know what that feels like.  Oh, come on.  If you had a movie role where you had to show off that fiery red bush of yours, you'd do it  in a second.  In a second.  You'd grow that in old school.  There's no need.  There's no need for that.  How do you know Rosie to the point where she invited you?  Rosie I met five years ago and became friends. 
[00:26:00]  Actual friends?  How did you meet and become friends?  How does that happen with the celebrity of the likes of Rosie O'Donnell?  She liked the TV show I was on called Whatever Martha.  I was big and fat.  Oh.  We know.  We know.  We remember.  We're happy for you, though.  Remember your dumb treadmill fucking videos.  It was weird.  When I look at old pictures of you now, I feel like it's you in a fat suit.  It's strange.  Is there any online?  It doesn't look real.  Could you find a fat Jenny Hutt picture? 
[00:26:30]  It's like Shallow Hal.  I know.  Oh, right.  It is, right?  Yeah.  That's when they called you Jenny the Hutt, right?  A couple of people probably associate with your show.  Yeah.  Wow.  Isn't that strange?  Fatty.  How much did you lose?  Jenny, how much?  I'm sorry.  How much?  70 pounds.  Wow.  Around 70 pounds.  That's great.  Good for you.  For real.  Wow.  I can't front on that one, yo.  Good for you.  Yeah, she looks good.  Thanks.  Dude, people used to say, you could tell she's got such a pretty face. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  It's a very, it's horrible thing to say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But were you all like, did you own it?  And you're like, I don't care.  I'm going to be me.  And then all of a sudden, once chubby people lose the weight, they're all of a sudden like,  yeah, this is the best thing I ever did.  But before that, they're all like, oh, no.  Oh, different body types.  And blah, blah, blah.  They make excuses.  No.  Me?  No, I was miserable.  First of all, I wasn't that fat my whole life.  I was like 20 pounds heavier.  Yeah, says you.  And then I blew up like a balloon.  But I was miserable.  And I don't believe in fat serenity. 
[00:27:30]  And I don't believe for me in fat acceptance.  For somebody else, great.  Good for you.  But for me, on the way.  It doesn't even look like you could have killed someone then and then lost the weight and gone  on the lamb.  No one would have caught you.  You don't even look like you.  You're kind of hot with a full face, though.  You're all right.  If you're into that kind of thing.  Yeah, you're all right.  I would have had no problem with that.  Yeah.  You'd have been a good fatty to lay into.  I had a big, big ass.  Did you?  Was it smelly? 
[00:28:00]  No.  Trouble keeping clean.  I'm a clean girl.  That's good.  People want us to ask you about Run-DMC at your Sweet 16.  We've done that already.  Yeah.  This broad is so rich.  She had Run-DMC at her 16th birthday party when Run-DMC really mattered, by the way.  You were like a My Super Sweet 16 girl.  Exactly.  Like an MTV.  I was.  I was not obnoxious.  I didn't even manage it.  That's another says you.  Yeah.  We kind of want to believe that you were pretty obnoxious.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Did you get a pony?  And your real dad brings you that stupid fucking karaoke.  And then you ran over like fucking retard feet and fucking hugged the stepfather's pony  and then laid under it like a girl in fucking Seattle.  I guess you didn't see that movie.  I guess you didn't see Taken.  Oh, well.  It's a great scene.  Yeah, I didn't see Taken.  All right.  Well, say hi to Dr. Drew for us.  Yeah.  I will.  And rest your lips because I'm sure they're very worn out from all that smooching. 
[00:29:00]  Did you take home one of the party favors, one of the little kittens that they were giving  out?  Hey, that was my joke.  I know.  It was funny.  Oh, thank you.  See, I was just going for a joke.  Yeah.  I said everyone leaving the party was going to get a kitten and mouthwash to get the taste  of Howard's ass out of their mouths.  It wasn't his word he put on Twitter, by the way.  Right.  I crafted it for Twitter.  Jesus.  What happened, Jenny? 
[00:29:30]  I said the gift bag had a Kindle Fire in it.  Whoa.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Just for people on that, like people like Rosie.  I was, again, just there.  Oh, on that level.  She included herself.  Yeah, I know.  She did.  You got one.  Yeah.  I took her.  I took her gift bag.  Did you have all access?  I kind of did.  Oh.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  Someone rates around here.  Did you blow Steven Tyler in the dressing room? 
[00:30:00]  I tried, but I didn't know it was someone else.  He looks like a pedo now, man.  I don't know what happened with him.  What do you think of Woody Allen?  Why?  Why'd you bring that up?  I think he's guilty as fuck.  Yeah, he sounds...  It doesn't look good, man.  Because his son is a very intelligent kid.  I follow him on Twitter now.  I like him a lot.  What's his name?  Dylan Rowan.  I'm sorry, Rowan.  Rowan.  Rowan Farrow.  Ronan.  Ronan?  Ronan Farrow.  No, wait.  No, Rowan. 
[00:30:30]  I believe R-O-W-A-N.  Yeah, he's got a good Twitter account.  Ronan, you're right.  Ronan Farrow.  I believe every word this guy has said about what happened.  Did you read Dylan's open letter?  Yep.  Boy.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  Does she not like toy choo-chos anymore?  Oh, boy.  What were the highlights of the letter for the people out there, Jimmy?  She basically came out and was talking about all the praise of Woody Allen and how, you 
[00:31:00]  know, this is what he did to me.  And this is, according to her, was that she went through the abuse.  I had heard years ago that he had put his face in her lap and smelled her.  And that was all I had ever heard.  And then she was saying that he did that.  And then she kind of highlighted, like, saying that he would take her away from her mother  and spend time alone with her and do this creepy stuff and make her suck his thumb.  And she felt weird about it.  And then she detailed this incident where he took her and laid her...  Turn it this way, Sam.  Sure.  We're safe, because we'll never be in... 
[00:31:30]  You put her on her belly.  Yeah.  I have her in front of me, Jay.  We're safe.  We'll never be in a Woody Allen movie, so we'll give you the real facts here.  Well, we have to read it.  I mean, it's...  Of course.  It's, uh, what's your favorite Woody Allen movie?  Before you answer, you should know.  When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like  attic on the second floor of our house.  He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set.  Oh, jeez.  Then he sexually assaulted me.  He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, 
[00:32:00]  promising that we'd go to Paris and I'd be a star in his movies.  I remember staring at the toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in a circle around the attic.  To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.  And then, in parentheses, she put, that one scene in The Sopranos really bugged me when  Bobby Bacala got killed.  I just made that last part up.  For as long as I can remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn't like.  I didn't like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings, and friends to be alone 
[00:32:30]  with him.  I didn't like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth.  I didn't like it when I had to get into bed with him under the sheets when he was in his  underwear.  I'm just remembering this.  I didn't like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe  out.  I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters.  But he always found me.  These things happen so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from my mother that would  have protected me had she known that I thought it was normal. 
[00:33:00]  I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters.  But what he did to me in the attic felt different.  I couldn't keep the secret anymore.  Should I read the next?  Yeah, yeah.  Jeez.  When I asked my mother if her dad did to her what Woody Allen did to me, I honestly did  not know the answer.  I also didn't know the firestorm it would trigger.  I didn't know that my father would use his sexual relationship with my sister to cover  up the abuse he inflicted on me.  I didn't know that he would accuse my mother of planting the abuse in my head and call her 
[00:33:30]  a liar for defending me.  I didn't know that I would be made to recount my story over and over again to doctor after  doctor, pushed to see if I'd admit I was lying as a part of a legal battle I couldn't possibly  understand.  At one point, my mother sat me down and told me that I wouldn't be in trouble if I was  lying, that I could take it all back.  I couldn't.  It was all true, but sexual abuse claims against the powerful stall more easily.  There were experts willing to attack my credibility. 
[00:34:00]  There were doctors willing to gaslight an abused child.  And I guess, how much more is there?  I don't want to spend an hour on this.  The end is pretty poignant.  Where should we pick up from?  Just keep going, man.  All right.  You're doing good.  This is a huge story.  Go down a little bit.  No, no.  Go to the top, to where we were.  Okay.  After a custody hearing denied my father visitation rights, my mother declined to pursue criminal 
[00:34:30]  charges despite finding of probable cause by the state of Connecticut due, in the words  of the prosecutor, the fragility of the child victim.  Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime.  That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up.  I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls.  I was terrified of being touched by men.  I developed an eating disorder.  I began cutting myself.  That torment was made worse by Hollywood.  All but a precious few, and in parentheses, she writes, my heroes, turned a blind eye. 
[00:35:00]  Most found it easier to accept the ambiguity to say, who can say what happened, to pretend  that nothing was wrong.  Actors praised him at award shows.  Networks put him on TV.  Critics put him in magazines.  Each time I saw my abuser's face on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television.  I could only hide my panic until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.  Last week, Woody Allen was nominated for his latest Oscar, but this time I refused to  fall apart. 
[00:35:30]  For so long, Woody Allen's acceptance silenced me.  I felt like a personable, I'm sorry, it felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and  the accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away.  But the survivors of sexual abuse who have reached out to me to support me and to share  their fears of coming forward, of being called a liar, of being told their memories aren't  their memories, have given me a reason not to be silent.  If only to let others, if only so, others know that they don't have to be silent either. 
[00:36:00]  We're almost done.  Today, I consider myself lucky.  I'm happily married.  I have the support of my amazing brothers and sisters.  I have a mother who found within herself a well of fortitude that saved us from the chaos  a predator brought into our home.  But all, but all, but others are still scared, vulnerable and struggling for the courage to  tell the truth.  The message that Hollywood sends matters for them.  What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett, Louis C.K., Alec Baldwin? 
[00:36:30]  What if it had been you, Emma Stone?  Or you, Scarlett Johansson?  You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton.  Have you forgotten me?  Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault  and abuse.  So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen.  Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name.  Imagine a world that celebrates her tormentor.  Are you imagining that?  Now, what is your favorite Woody Allen movie? 
[00:37:00]  Wow.  Yeah, that was fucking...  And I tell you, the only...  That was fucking the day of Philip Seymour Hoffman's death.  Yeah.  So that was the only thing that I think kept it off the...  Oh, God.  But that was on a New York Times blog.  That's still...  That's not going away.  No.  It'll come back a little bit, but yeah.  Woody Allen was knocked off the front pages by Philip Seymour Hoffman, that's for sure.  So what do you think of it, Jenny Hut?  You brought it up.  Yeah, I think he did it.  I mean, she's right. 
[00:37:30]  We sort of give him a pass to be such a genius filmmaker, and he doesn't look...  I'm doing air quotes, like a pedophile, but I suppose he does.  Kind of does.  He does look like a pedophile.  Glasses and nebbishy.  He absolutely looks like a pedophile.  Yeah, but you're looking at me, he's so insecure and neurotic.  What do you think pedophiles are confident?  What do you think pedophiles walk around and hear the theme from Saturday Night Fever playing?  You know, I don't...  It's hard to...  I don't want it to be true because I love Woody Allen. 
[00:38:00]  That's the reality of it.  I don't want it to be true because I love the genius of what he is.  But it's hard to discount what she said.  Like, when you hear a specific thing like that, it's really, really hard to write it off.  Well, you could separate the two, can't you?  Some of those movies are terrific.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone has a problem in theory of separating the two,  other than he just got this Lifetime Achievement Award.  So then talk about his whole life.  Like, talk about the fact that he's a genius filmmaker and also a giant creep.  Yeah, he is a bit of a creep. 
[00:38:30]  I think the genius filmmaker stuff goes out the window when you have allegations like that.  But Hollywood, if they're willing to overlook stuff like that,  like, it's like racism, they're not.  A homophobia, they're not.  But look what Roman Polanski absolutely did.  And they line up to work with him.  Oh, yeah.  They can't not work with him.  And look, I know Woody was never convicted, so it's like, I understand benefit of the doubt.  But it seems like Hollywood never, again, like the way they would have, like with Mel Gibson.  Yeah, yeah, Mel Gibson.  Who had some shitty anti-Semitic views. 
[00:39:00]  And I don't like his views.  I think he's a brilliant filmmaker.  But look at the penalty he has suffered for his views.  Yeah.  Whereas a guy like the allegations against Woody were pretty heavy.  And he has only suffered embarrassment.  No real penalty in Hollywood.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think Woody is so entrenched in Hollywood and so beloved that I think he'll actually skate this, too.  Here's what's interesting.  I don't know.  It's when you're calling out, I'm sorry, guys.  Hello, but.  He has not responded to allegations in recent years until now. 
[00:39:30]  And now he put out a statement, I think yesterday, saying it's all untrue.  And that more will come.  He'll say more.  He has to.  He has to, because basically she's saying it's not his quote unquote crazy ex-wife.  It's the girl.  And you can't just come after her like you nut.  Yeah, yeah.  That looks bad.  It's very specific what she's saying.  And the whole thing about suck my thumb and the staring at that fucking train going around. 
[00:40:00]  It's so gross.  The suck my thumb is disgusting.  Yeah.  Although, that is kind of graphic and creepy of the thumb.  And, you know, it's almost like when she's calling out specific actors.  To me, the worst one there was Diane Keaton because she said, you knew me when I was little.  Have you forgotten me?  Yeah.  What does that mean, right?  That's heavy, man.  That's fucking hard for anyone as an actor to read.  Right.  Definitely throwing some guilt around.  But, yeah, it's, you know.  I'm not going to say I wouldn't work with them.  I would take my children to school.  Otherwise, I would stay on the school. 
[00:40:30]  All right, Jenny.  Oh, no, we were done, too.  Thanks for having me.  Bye, Jenny.  Bye, Jenny.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  You're wonderful.  Jenny Hutt, everyone.  I wonder if she still can smell that doody on her lips.  Like, she's got a scrub, a scrub, and it's like, it's still a little there.  Yeah.  I went to Baby Diaper Mustache.  It was just her and her pictures.  Yeah.  What are they going to do this year at the Oscars?  Are they going to fucking...  Have they come out and said this guy's a fucking fraud yet?  The castaway guy?  I know, right?  Zach Galifianakis.  He's a fraud. 
[00:41:00]  And he's all fad.  What kind of fat guy have you been shipwrecking?  You're not going to get that fat on...  He said he ate fish.  Yeah.  For over a year.  What happened with this guy?  He's a castaway.  His boat fucking...  The engine broke or something.  Yeah.  And he got to a little island, right?  And he lived there...  14 months.  He lived there for 14 months.  And then what happened?  How did he get off the island?  He got left to the airport.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to come out.  He's a fraud, right?  It's gone.  As soon as I saw him, I'm like, this is not possible. 
[00:41:30]  And then there was another guy with him that died.  He's too fat for being on a fish diet.  Huh?  Another guy that was with him that died.  Really?  So that could be some shenanigans.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, like five weeks or four weeks into the ordeal, the other guy died.  And he just kind of rolled him off the boat into the water.  And then he continued to live for another, you know.  So maybe they had some kind of crazy fight.  Maybe something's going on, right?  He fucking kills that guy and goes, well, fuck.  I'll just say I'm shipwrecked.  I'll just say the engine fucking went.  I got to hang out somewhere for a while. 
[00:42:00]  I got to lay low.  I don't know.  But they're comparing him to Tom Hanks and Castaway.  This is very suspicious.  Very, yeah.  It's fishy.  Where's the story?  I'm trying to see if we got all the details on this one.  I think we pretty much have it, right?  Yeah.  I just don't know how he got rescued.  That's all.  That's the part I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know how they found him.  Mystery at sea, they're calling it.  And he's fucking like.  Turns up 5,000 miles away. 
[00:42:30]  He's got a bunch of weight on him.  Oh, well.  The door, who are anxiously awaiting his return.  Oh, boy.  His mother, Julia, says she never believed her son was dead  and can't wait to take care of him and have the family together.  He will likely be reunited with his family soon.  For now, he is recovering from his ordeal.  What is he recovering from, though?  I mentioned that Alvarenga has been traveling with a companion, a teenager.  Teenager.  He apparently refused to eat the fish and birds and turtles they were catching. 
[00:43:00]  So Alvarenga says he died four weeks after they drifted off course.  He refused to eat.  This is not the end of the story.  Do you believe it?  I think what we're all sitting here with this look like, I'm just not sure.  What big bitch hasn't refused to eat?  Oh, no.  13 months eating just turtles makes you look different than that guy.  Yeah.  That's the big sticking point there.  Good for you, News.  That's what sticks with me.  I just imagine him looking much different.  He looked a little dirty.  What's next?  Do you rock saying he was in a concentration camp?  If I recall, there was a story years ago of three fishermen from Mexico who kind of charted 
[00:43:30]  the same course and survived.  It's a little chunky.  Did the currents actually go?  All right.  Good for that.  Poor kid.  They're suspicious as well.  All right.  Good.  Yeah.  No.  It's going to.  Yeah.  They're going to close in on them and forget the real story.  I mean, if you're if you're stranded like that, you're not going to refuse to eat.  Yeah.  That seems a little odd.  That goes against your whole human nature.  Yep.  I mean, looking at a fucking turtle and going, oh, Jesus, I got to eat this to survive. 
[00:44:00]  But you're going to eat it.  Yep.  Right.  You shove some of that in your mouth.  And fish isn't that bad.  Fresh fish.  You ever eat fresh fish right after it's been caught?  Not really.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what this guy was fucking eating before.  You know?  Right.  Living in the lap of luxury.  I doubt it.  I guess.  He killed the kid for whatever reason.  Now he's like, fuck, I can't go home.  So I need a fucking story.  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, I ate fish and turtles and birds and he didn't want to eat this shit, so he died and  I threw him overboard. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  Isn't that what they just said?  He's not saying why he did that.  Why?  Wouldn't you keep the body?  I don't know.  It might start stinking.  Yeah, but I think you have no choice because if you just throw the body overboard, people  are going to think, you know, did you murder the kid?  A little doubt there, you know?  Yeah.  Now he's got the doubt.  Big holes in his story.  Yeah.  All right.  We got food.  We're going to take a break.  Just getting started.  Stay there.  Yeah.  He was great. 
[00:45:00]  Fucking just a terribly good actor, man.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great actor.  He rued the day.  Rued the day he came up on extremely fucking strong heroin.  He was probably our best actor, right?  He was pretty goddamn good.  Gary Oldman's up there as far as a guy who can play anything.  Who else can play anything?  But even in a bad movie, I was trying to think of a bad movie Philip Seymour Hoffman was in.  Twister.  Yeah.  Well, that was early in his career. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  But his performance was always great, no matter what movie you're watching.  I watched a couple of his movies that were just complete dullards.  Dullard shit.  But his characters were great.  What was the one with the old age home?  No one saw this movie.  Oh.  Do you know the movie I'm talking about?  But he was amazing in that.  Cocoon?  Is it the Ben Stiller movie?  The Ben Stiller movie?  Wasn't he in one of those ones?  Something about Mary.  Along Came Polly.  Right? 
[00:46:00]  He was in that?  Along Came Polly.  He was in Along Came Polly.  He was in that.  I'm talking about a real just dark fucking movie.  Oh my God.  Where his mom, I think, was put into a home or something.  Anyone?  Magnolia?  I just stopped the floor with a fucking conversation for nothing.  Yeah, whatever.  It'll come to me.  He was great in doubt.  He was amazing in doubt.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Jimmy saw him recently.  At Louie's house for Thanksgiving. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, that's right.  It's the only time I ever met him.  He was...  Was he cool?  He was very nice.  Yeah, but it was just his children were there.  That's the first thing I thought of when I heard he died.  I was like, God, he had three kids.  That's a little selfish.  He was conversational and friendly to people.  He wasn't a dick.  He wasn't standoffish.  No.  He was talking to Parker Posey about some project.  And he went out and I could tell he smoked.  So I was like, I didn't...  He's kind of heavy.  He's smoking.  Right.  But he was friendly to everybody.  And it's just, you know, regular dude. 
[00:47:00]  And Ant just said he was a little selfish.  Oh, yeah.  That's kind of crazy.  Very selfish.  Well, a lot of people get mad if you say that.  Well.  You know, because he was an addict.  You know, he couldn't help himself.  I don't know, man.  I think when you have kids, you try to put your shit together.  You really try, whether it's eating a little better or exercising or maybe deciding not to do heroin anymore.  What were his demons?  Well, that.  I mean, being an addict, that selfishness is a big part of it and self-centeredness.  Yeah.  Well, I was reading up on him a little bit. 
[00:47:30]  He was from Fairport.  He was from Rochester.  Whoa.  And Fairport is a really nice area of Rochester.  Yeah.  And he was like all in with drugs back then.  He stopped doing hard drugs at, what, 23 years old?  Something like that?  Yeah, that's what I heard in an interview that they were playing.  But he went from Fairport to NYU and, you know, he had a pretty solid upbringing in life.  So that's a very good question.  I don't know.  I don't know what his demons could have possibly been. 
[00:48:00]  Sometimes you just get turned on to something.  It's like, you know, I had a good life growing up and somebody just, you know, you're doing well.  And they'll tell someone, hey, try this.  And you're like, fuck, I love it.  It doesn't always have to be anything bad in the past.  And that's all it takes, right?  It can, I guess.  Yeah, sure.  You just like being high.  You like being away.  It does seem like that if you do have kids, though, and a life like that, like, just the fact that you like doing something doesn't seem like it's enough to go past that.  You know?  Like, if you have some kind of fucking, I got to do heroin because I got to get this out of my head that's constantly fucking eating at my brain, then I could see, you know, hey, I really don't have much control over this. 
[00:48:30]  But just that, hey, it feels good.  Right.  That seems like a pretty shitty thing to sacrifice your family over.  But once you're addicted, it's like once you cross that line, nothing before it, Matt, like once you're hooked, you're hooked.  It's almost like, well, I'm just kind of, I was, life was great and then I got hooked on it and I'm still doing it is the same as I had a horrible upbringing and I'm getting rid of those demons. 
[00:49:00]  Because once you're addicted to it and you fucking need it to come around physically and just have a normal day, it doesn't matter.  You're, you're in, you're in.  Yeah.  That's true.  Does that scare you, Jimmy?  It terrifies you.  Of course.  I mean, I never did have one, but a guy sober or whatever.  No, that's what I was thinking about you because you've been sober a very long time.  February 1st was my anniversary.  Congratulations.  February 1st of 87.  87.  Wow.  So 13, 27 years?  Jesus.  27 years.  So you're around the, well, Philip Seymour Hoffman, they said, was sober for 23. 
[00:49:30]  And then out of nowhere, this pops back up, pops its ugly head back up.  Yeah, it scares me a lot.  And then obviously it went all in.  70 bags they're up to, that they have found.  And, and, and, I don't know.  Anxiety medicine?  And then who has to, who has to tell the press that they found a needle in his arm?  That came out immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah, and he was found with a needle in his arm.  But I guess you would assume that, right?  If you, if you got a bad dose or whatever the fuck happened.  I don't know.  That's fast. 
[00:50:00]  While you're in the middle of doing it.  Yeah.  Jesus, that's fast.  If you fucking can't even get the needle out of your arm.  Well, he might have just sat there and like passed out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever, heart attack killed him or some shit.  Wow.  Terrible.  I mean, but it does kind of shed light on, there's a lot of untalented people that are dropping  dead like this every day, too.  Yeah, a few people were pissed off the fact that the NYPD said they're going out and looking for  this dealer that's selling this killer heroin.  And some people were like, hey, you know, there's been a thousand people that have died 
[00:50:30]  from the same heroin.  No one gave it a second thought to go out and, you know, try to find the dealer.  I'm sure they've been looking for the dealer.  Yeah.  It's not like the NYPD ignores heroin dealers.  Yeah, that's true.  There was a back and forth on the news.  Dershowitz was involved and somebody was saying that, you know, the dealer should go away for  life because he killed Philip Seymour Hoffman.  And then they're basically saying any drug dealer should go away for life if they're  the ones that sold the dope to the person that OD'd or whatever.  And Dershowitz was like, that's fucking crazy talk. 
[00:51:00]  Absolutely.  That should not happen.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Well, I mean, it should be the penalty.  It can't be higher because somebody OD'd on your product as it would be if they didn't  OD on your product.  But it's illegal product.  Yeah, I understand.  But would that help the drug problem a little bit if dealers know they could go away?  If that's a good point, if someone ODs on their shit, you know what, dude, people are  getting 25 years anyway.  It's like the penalties for heroin dealing are pretty stiff.  And if you're a two time offender, you're going for life anyway in California. 
[00:51:30]  I don't see that as being a deterrent because nobody does shit with the plan.  I'm being caught.  Right.  So I don't know if that would matter.  And to me, it's like alcohol companies have no penalty at all.  Right.  And I know the legality of it, but considering the damage their product causes, not one ounce  of culpability.  It really is amazing.  Way more damage.  Way more.  Way more.  It really is.  Alcohol causes way more deaths than heroin.  It's really the only product that is sold that isn't held responsible in like any lawsuits. 
[00:52:00]  I never heard like, oh, Seagram's is being sued for the death of the...  It's never a case.  Yeah, it's a legal product, just like smoking, but smoking is constantly being...  Well, then again, cigarettes lied.  They brought that on themselves by lying for some years.  Car companies, though, you know, it's like, oh, they made an unsafe car, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a problem with this or that.  Like, but booze is just like, yeah, that's what it does.  Right.  And they're not responsible for anything you do once you start pouring it down your mouth. 
[00:52:30]  Which is technically, I guess, correct.  Right.  They shouldn't be.  I guess so.  Let's go.  The phone's just lit the fuck up.  Chris in New York.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  This Philip Seymour Hoffman, I think he had daddy issues.  I'm pretty sure his father wasn't around growing up.  It was just a single mother with him and like two or three other siblings.  Right.  I did hear that.  You're right.  The mom raised four kids alone.  Right.  And that's got to be fucking crazy.  Well, that fuck, yeah.  I mean, I brought seven kids with two parents, and that was insanity. 
[00:53:00]  But then there's some of us that wish we were raised by one parent, so.  I never, the guy, loved him as an actor, but when you're that fat and your blood pressure  is that bad, the last thing you need to be doing is messing with something like heroin.  Yeah.  You don't really ask it for.  Well, logic certainly would state that, but, you know, who knows what goes on in your fucking  head to justify it.  That's how strong it is, though. 
[00:53:30]  Like, I think of Geraldo a lot who overdosed and had three sons, and I'm like, I would  love to smash him.  And I'm sure if he was alive, he would go, what a dummy I am.  How can I do that?  Like, he would be so fucking angry with himself if he knew that he was going to abandon his  three sons.  And he was extremely intelligent, Greg Geraldo, and we watched him suffer through this shit.  Right in front of our eyes, he was trying to tell us, well, I don't want to speak ill  of him, but we, you know, he was trying to tell us one thing when it was obvious to everyone  it wasn't true, but that just shows the struggle that was going on in his own head. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  Thanks, buddy.  Do addicts lie a lot, Jimmy?  Every time their fucking lips move, it's nonsense and bullshit.  The old joke, an old joke is an alcoholic will steal your money, but an addict will steal  your money and then help you look for it, which is just an age-old fucking joke, but addicts  lie a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.  Thank you. 
[00:54:30]  Let's say hi to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Anthony's teeth are falling out, by the way, like Goldblum on the fly.  But they're still falling out?  Yeah, I go today.  And did they really fall out during the big Joe Rogan, Ricky Gervais show?  Yeah, right at the end during, like, yeah.  You didn't tell anybody.  Why wouldn't you tell us?  That would have been hilarious.  Because I just wanted to keep the, you know, shit going.  My teeth fell out?  That would have been an okay stop.  My teeth fell out.  Well, just one tooth popped out.  I was like, and then I put it in. 
[00:55:00]  I'm trying to do wreath.  Can we hear that?  Well, let it fall out.  Who cares?  Let me see.  Did it fall out again?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  I'll leave it off.  But it's not really ground.  Yeah.  You said it was grounded down or whatever.  It's a little bit ground down.  A little bit.  It's just reshaped.  So you get your big falsies today?  That's cool.  They're not falsies.  Good for you.  They're laminants.  Laminants.  They're permanent.  Okay.  I know they fancy up the names these days.  No, it's not a fancy name for dentures.  It's laminants.  We'll be the judge tomorrow, sir. 
[00:55:30]  They're my teeth.  They laminate over them.  Right.  Don't put up pictures of horses.  Oh, no.  Sam, you're a smart ass.  No, that's what comes up in Google image.  You put laminants.  And George Washington's teeth come up.  We learned that the other day.  Boy, did we.  We got a lot of guys and gals that went in on this hurling thing.  Let's say hi to Matt.  I guess we said hi to you, Matt.  What do you got, buddy?  Just as far as him, you guys talking about how he possibly could have got hooked.  But you snore a couple of bags for two or three days. 
[00:56:00]  On that fourth day, you're either going to suffer or you're going to continue using.  It's that easy to get strung out on dope.  You know?  Yeah, they say it's a very fast.  Yeah, it's really, it grabs you.  You know, you can think you're just going to use it for a couple of days.  And then all of a sudden, you're like, holy shit, I feel like hell.  And you're in.  And, you know, you've got to go get help or keep using.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  Were you on it?  Matt, were you on it? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How did you get off it?  Or were you still on it?  I was lucky enough to get arrested back in 2009.  And I've been in the program ever since.  But, I mean, I wasted 30 years of a good life.  And I shouldn't go from pills, powders, whatever.  And you said in there you were lucky enough to get arrested.  That's a very interesting comment there.  Yeah, you know, and as they were cuffing me up, I knew there was a lot of suffering heading my way. 
[00:57:00]  But, you know, in jail, they, you know, you've got no choice.  You suffer.  You go through it.  And then you're out.  And, you know, you've got to decide that, oh, of course, this happened to me at age 50.  So, I was in jail with a bunch of savages.  You got arrested at 50 years old?  Yeah.  What were you doing?  Was it the drugs or were you charged with something else?  I was smoking crack.  But I got charged from selling two Xanax on a New Haven green. 
[00:57:30]  And I needed gas money.  I was all about it.  Two Xanax?  Two Xanax on a New Haven green just to get some gas money.  And, yeah, they locked me up.  What, did you sell to a cop?  I sold to, you know, some kid who was informing for the cops.  So, it was recorded and videoed.  So, I was like, you know.  And, hey, after we drove away from the green, they pulled me over, just took my info.  And I thought I got away with whatever they were, you know, whatever they were pulling me over for. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And, like, a month later, a warrant came out.  And they got me.  And that was that.  How long did you go away for?  I only stayed in jail for, like, 45 days.  That's a long time for two Xanax.  45 fucking days?  Wow.  Seems like they had you.  They wanted to give me four years at first.  And I was like, no.  Oh, no.  You can't just say no.  Yeah, so that's not a good legal defense.  No.  Did you have priors? 
[00:58:30]  Did you have priors?  That's the thing.  I hadn't been arrested in, like, 18 years.  So, I thought, I'm good.  And the first word out of the bitch prosecutor's mouth was, your honor, he's got priors.  And I said, really, 20 years ago?  But that was the whole thing.  I was in jail before.  Once you've been in, your first options are not, you know, probation or this or that.  Let's lock them back up.  It's just a question of how long.  Xanax.  50 years old.  He's in for two Xanax.  What a bitch. 
[00:59:00]  You must have been a bitch.  I was laying on the top bunk listening to all the mania going on.  And he's a huge storm with 500 people blacked in their samba music.  And security guards, they can't read.  There are correctional officers that don't know how to read.  I got a college degree.  I'm not saying I'm the greatest guy on earth.  I think you are.  You're no Andy Dufresne.  I was in music.  Oh, it sucks. 
[00:59:30]  But, you know, the worst day in my life, getting arrested that day, it turned out to save my life.  Very good.  And where are you at now there, Matt?  How old are you now?  I'll be 54 tomorrow.  That's inspiring.  No, I'll be 55 tomorrow.  55.  55 tomorrow.  You should celebrate with some heroin.  That's not a good suggestion, Ant.  No?  It's not helpful.  It's not helpful.  You're not helping him.  I'm not yet.  You guys are not helping.  All right.  All right, brother.  Happy birthday.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Matt. 
[01:00:00]  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  I can relate to this heroin issue.  I mean, it is so out of control.  I bought a place in Dobsburg, New York, about six years ago.  And the first thing you do is you check your neighbors out.  You're like, all right, let me see what kind of neighbors I'm living next to.  I had a family of four upstairs from me.  Two young girls, the mother and father.  And in a matter of six years, it spiraled out of control.  I can relate to Chris, the first caller, saying they had no father figure. 
[01:00:30]  The father died, and the daughter went nuts.  She went completely nuts.  And she OD'd last week, and they found her dead in her car.  Jesus.  Huge story.  Yeah, no care.  Yeah, she's 28 years old.  You know what?  It's so bad.  I mean, I saw her spiral out of control over the last year and a half.  The cop must have been called probably about 18 to 25 times in the past six months.  Let's get to have some happy, successful drug stories. 
[01:01:00]  I'll deal with it myself.  I mean, I'm not a cop caller.  Right.  But, you know, my fiancée just moved in, and, you know, she was petrified.  She didn't know what was going on upstairs.  They go on, she'd go on like a four-day bender, and she would never go to sleep.  Like a good bender.  Right.  Oh, she was, I mean, it was terrible, you know, but, I mean, for her to pass away the  way she did, I mean, the poor girl, they found her in her car dead with a needle in her arm.  Everyone's got the needle in their arm.  Never get that fucking thing out.  Needle of the damage done.  Oh, boy.  All right, John. 
[01:01:30]  Terrible, man.  Thank you.  Let's talk to...  Hey, take care, guys.  Thanks for taking my call.  All right.  Darla in Baltimore has a story.  Darla.  Hey, hello.  What's up?  Darla Hood.  What?  So, my husband, he was addicted to heroin for 20 years.  When I met him...  Wow, you must have been a real bitch.  It's the only way you could handle her.  Sorry, Darla.  Sorry.  He was sober when I met him.  When I met him, he was sober about eight years.  He's 20 years older than I am. 
[01:02:00]  So, he was telling me, we've been talking about this Hoffman thing, and he said, you know,  from the minute you decide to put heroin in your arm, you know it's poison, and that you're  already a broken person.  I mean, he was a white middle class kid.  Would you say, shut up, I'm watching TV?  Yeah.  White middle class kid went to all Catholic school and started shooting dope when he was  like 18 years old.  And basically rebuilt his whole life at age 40. 
[01:02:30]  That's good.  I can't imagine fucking needle.  But how do you...  Fucking dealing with a needle.  And how did he survive 20 years doing that shit?  He's pretty damn lucky, right?  He's lucky to be alive.  He had overdosed a couple times.  Jesus.  Was arrested.  Had warrants out in different states.  And what he had going for him was he had a really high IQ, and he could write really well.  So, he would just get out. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, it was just, you know, he was just lucky.  Lucky.  I'm his fourth wife, too.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Just lucky number four.  Yeesh.  I've been married 15 years, and we have a child together, and everything's great.  He has a master's degree.  So, you can turn your life around, but he is an unusual case.  Right.  It's inspiring stories today.  Inspiring.  Don't do heroin.  Well, it certainly gets everyone thinking. 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  I'm happy I never did that one, man.  Never.  It's just needles scare me, and I hate being nauseous.  I know that that vomiting was a huge part of heroin.  It was like, that's frightening.  Is that part of the treat?  Yeah.  It's nasty.  He said he had to go in the hospital, but he had, like, pus.  He had, like, sores all over his feet and pus, and, you know, he had infection.  They thought he had AIDS.  You know, I keep, when you see him today, he, he.  And this was all turn-ons for you?  I don't want to see him today.  Busy.  I guess you met him after all this, I'm thinking. 
[01:04:00]  I met him in college.  I was, you know, I was.  Wait, he's 20 years older than you.  Oh, you were in college.  Gotcha.  Okay, okay.  You scared me for a second.  Yeah, right.  When I, when I met him, I was 32, I was 47, 48, 17 years older than me.  Okay.  Grounding.  Gotcha.  You know, yeah, there were some red flags, but he had some other stuff going on that was  all right.  Right on.  Big talk. 
[01:04:30]  All right, Darla.  Thank you so much.  Bye.  Love your show.  All right.  Let's go to Nick in Syracuse.  Nick.  Hey, hey, what's up, boys?  I just wanted to talk about as far as, there's actually, you know, a psychedelic, there's  actually a couple of them, ayahuasca, you've probably heard of, there's one that's called  a boga or ibogaine, and, you know, Joe Rogan talks about it a lot.  He's talked about it a lot.  People have used that, those drugs, it's got like a 90% cure rate for any addiction, not 
[01:05:00]  even just to like, and for even the worst, most highly addictive drugs, like crack, heroin,  all that, all that shit.  Oh, yeah?  Is it reasonable?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  It's not even allowed.  It's illegal in the U.S. for whatever reason, but it's legal in Mexico, so people go to clinics  down in Mexico.  Yeah, they fucking, yeah, you trip your balls off, I guess, for like a couple days.  You puke and all that shit.  But, and then, I don't know, whatever it does, basically, it cures you.  I had a buddy who had definitely worked with, he tried to go cold turkey from opiates. 
[01:05:30]  You know, his thing wasn't heroin, it was like the pills, the Oxy-80s, but he couldn't  do it.  And then he tried the Suboxone stuff, which is like the treatment they give you in the  U.S., which they, you give it this Suboxone, which is just another opiate, and they try  to weed it out.  So what about an Anthony-it?  Nah.  That's good.  Wait a minute.  I'm fucking Norton-it.  Well, no, not according to the intro.  Oh.  You didn't fix that? 
[01:06:00]  It's not fixed?  No, I wouldn't.  Fix it.  I thought it was fixed.  Yeah, but it's fucking, I don't know, man, but it's just kind of weird, like, that it's  not allowed in the U.S., but yeah, it's, um.  But Rogan, all right, I got you.  So Rogan talks about this, and this is a way to maybe get off drugs, get off some of  these hardcore drugs.  My question is, though, like, what does that do?  Like, it might help the physical thing, but the personality shit that makes you an addict,  they're all the, like, when I quit smoking, the nicotine, hold on.  Hold on one sec, Nick. 
[01:06:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Like, what does it do for that?  Because, like, when I quit smoking, a big part of it was drinking water, and that's why  people put weight on, because the act, it's the physical act of putting hand to mouth  and in front of the computer.  There's so much psychological stuff that goes with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're totally right about that.  And what it does, actually, is when you take it, your hallucinations, you're going to  hallucinate very, you know, it's going to be crazy.  And what it does is, it makes you face whatever that core issue is.  They say that basically doing that is worth about, like, 60 years and heavy therapy you 
[01:07:00]  can get in about three days from that, because what it does is, your own mind, like, whatever  hallucinations and nightmares and horrifying shit that you might see, like, you're going  to go through hell.  You're going to feel like you're in hell.  Sounds like some wacky, yeah.  I would imagine you still need some heavy therapy after you use that drug to get off  the hard drugs.  90% of cures, the other 10% eat at baby's feet and jump in front of the train. 
[01:07:30]  The FDA will not approve it.  Yeah, it's not exactly.  I feel bad for the other 10%.  But, yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  But, I don't know, it's very odd that it's not allowed on the U.S.  And what's it called again real fast before we let you go?  There's two names.  The medicine name for it is ibogaine.  It's ibogaine.  I'm not really sure how to spell it, but the plant it comes from is called iboga, which  is, like, an African shrub or something. 
[01:08:00]  But it's all just forms of DMT, just like, you know, the same shit that's in mushrooms  or any other psychedelics.  That was a simple question.  What's the name?  All right, sir.  I'm going to do more research on this.  That's yappy.  Maybe find the podcast Joe Rogan did where he discusses this.  Yeah, bring that shit up, because it could help a lot of people.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He loves to talk, that guy.  Well, yeah.  We got a lot of people, man.  Yeah.  On the, uh, let's see how to Rick in Canada.  Rick.  Hi, Rick. 
[01:08:30]  Good morning, boys.  Thanks for taking my call.  I think this dark movie that Opie's thinking of is called The Letter.  He's married to a woman who committed suicide, and she leaves a shield envelope for a suicide  letter.  Oh, you talking about this Philip Seymour Hoffman movie?  Oh.  Love Liza, where he starts sniffing glue, and he goes on the...  No, he sniffs model airplane fuel.  Yeah, oh, fuel, right.  It was a weird movie.  I didn't love it because, uh...  But he was great, and he was amazing.  He was a little too slow and, like, pointless.  And I shouldn't say pointless, but a meandering, I think. 
[01:09:00]  But it was still, it acted really, really well.  Well, he took a lot of...  He had a lot of brave choices.  Yeah.  He just didn't go for the hits all the time.  In his underwear.  Yeah, love Liza.  Cool.  I don't know...  Love Liza.  I'm sorry.  That's it.  Right.  It was very sad that his wife had left him this suicide note, and he couldn't bring himself  to read it.  It was really a terribly sad fucking concept.  Right.  He liked taking those sad roles.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Doug in Syracuse.  Doug. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, let's talk about the brave role of a long-came Polly.  For Philip Seymour Hoffman.  See, I never saw that.  Yeah, that movie was...  I didn't like it.  No, it's a terrible movie, and he plays Ben Stiller's best friend in it.  Oh, okay.  Is that the line...  Wait, is that the one...  There's one really funny scene where he...  The first time I ever heard sharded was from Philip Seymour Hoffman, where he goes, I sharded.  We got to go, man.  Let's go.  I sharded.  That's the first time I ever heard that that made me laugh, so I thought of that recently. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, I didn't like a long-came Polly.  I guess you're right.  There's a bad performance in a bad movie.  I'm sure there's been some terrible movies he's been in.  Sure.  But you can't really think of any of them.  You guys are welcome.  Punching out.  All right.  Wow.  Jeez.  Look at the interesting stuff he was doing, and look at the roles De Niro takes.  Like, almost like...  And De Niro's got twice the time in that Hoffman does.  Yeah.  You know, he's really just taking all these weird choices and trying to be different things.  All right.  Let's say hi to Daniel.  He's calling from Korea. 
[01:10:30]  Jesus.  Hi, Daniel.  I think he calls every once in a while, now that I think about it.  What's up, buddy?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  First and foremost, the other movie you were talking about was called The Savages, where  he was a writer and his dad got put in the home or some shit.  I think that's the one.  I absolutely think that's the one.  It was about one of his parents being put in the home.  This thing was so dark, and it was filmed in just dark colors, and it was deeply depressing.  And I remember seeing the movie going, wow, he's a great actor, but what is the purpose 
[01:11:00]  of this film?  It's just getting everyone sad.  Sometimes those, they put them out just for that.  I believe that's the one I was thinking of, yes.  Yeah, well, I work drug suppression team up in northern New York when I was up there with  the army.  And when they say he had 70 bags of heroin in his house, they're not like Ziploc bags  or shit like that.  They're called stamp bags.  They're about the size of, well, shit, a postage stamp.  And they just, it's for individual use when they smoke their heroin. 
[01:11:30]  That's what I assumed, small bags.  Yeah, but how many highs is that?  It's just a fucking one high.  I mean...  One high for the 70 bags?  No, not for the 70 bags, per bag.  That'd be 70 highs.  But that's still a lot, then, if that's 70 highs.  Uh-huh.  Oh, no, there's no saying that it's not a shit ton of heroin in a ridiculous amount,  but it's not like he was fucking getting ready to go distribute it.  Oh, we all know that.  We all know it was for his individual use. 
[01:12:00]  That wasn't in question.  Yeah.  Well, yes, Kenny.  Oh, no.  Hold on, yes.  Some addicts could have a 10-bag-a-day habit.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  That could have just been for a couple days.  Yeah, so for a weekend, you could easily do 20, 30 bags.  The paper said there was 23 empty bags.  Jesus.  Do you think, why such lousy housekeeping?  Yeah.  He's obviously a housekeeper.  Like, why would he leave that shit around?  That could have just, like you said, been for a weekend or three days.  What would you do, Kenny?  Crack their teeth and run their pockets? 
[01:12:30]  I don't know what you're referring to.  But here was one of my favorite movies with De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He played a tranny in Flawless.  Flawless.  I didn't see that either.  1999.  It's a good one.  It's good?  Yeah, you got to watch it.  De Niro does a good role.  I didn't see Flawless either.  It's a good one.  I'm going to look it up.  I recommend it, people.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, you had me a tranny.  A penny pick.  Thank you.  One last thing.  One last thing, boys. 
[01:13:00]  When Jimmy talks about it on his show sometimes, apparently Philip Seymour Hoffman was getting  treated for an injury, and he got back into the drug addiction and whatnot from opiates,  painkillers, things like that.  You got to be so careful with that.  They scare the fucking shit out of me.  Whenever I have a pain, I'm not a martyr.  If I'm truly hurt, I will take one.  But I take them so carefully.  I take less than the recommended dosage.  And I talk to people.  I'm always talking to people.  They really fucking frighten me.  Because that could just be the trigger right there, right? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  And years ago, a guy named Jim, who really pretty much saved my life, was a guy who would  always say, motives are everything.  You always know what your motive is deep down.  You can lie to everybody, but you have to know what your motive is for doing something  right.  Yeah, if your motive is to take the pain away, you know, physical pain away, that's  one thing.  If you're like, hey, I kind of like the buzz this has given me, ah, that's the problem.  Hey, I'm kind of, if you're trying to sneak one in, you're just lying to yourself with  who you're lying to.  Right.  Yep.  All right.  Thanks, Daniel.  All right.  That's all I got, boys.  Thank you. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  That's quite enough.  Thank you.  Yeah, no kidding.  We're going to go on to happier things in a few more minutes here.  But first, Andy in Boston.  Andy.  Hey, a couple things real quick on the movies.  Yeah, Along Came Polly was a shitty movie, but if you're going to laugh in that movie,  it's really only when Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it.  I thought he was hilarious in it.  And how about the Hannibal movie?  When he was the reporter, he got his face bit off and then lit on fire in the wheelchair.  You remember that?  No, I saw that, but I don't remember him in it. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Yeah, I was fucking 16.  He was in a ton of movies.  A few really cool, a few scenarios in my life.  All three of these happened before any of us were 20 years old.  One of my really good friends at 17 was hooked on heroin.  He just couldn't deal with it anymore.  He went home, grabbed his older brother's gun, because he was a police officer.  Went upstairs while his older brother and father were just sitting at the kitchen table.  Just blew his brains out.  So that was a victim of heroin. 
[01:15:00]  Secondly, a kid that was pretty good in school, good athlete, gets out of high school, gets hooked on oxys, gets hooked on heroin.  He robbed the local CVS with a fucking glue gun in his pocket for oxys.  He did six years.  And now he's in and out of prison pretty much, in and out of being an addict.  So that's a sad case.  But the happiest story was my older brother.  He was hooked on heroin for five, six years as a teenager. 
[01:15:30]  Same thing as some guys set a few calls ago.  They found him on the side of the road, half dead, with the needle in his arm.  And getting arrested, I think, is one of the saving grace for any of these people, because it is true.  They told him either you go to prison or you go to rehab.  And, you know, 15 years later, not only is he sober, but he's one of these cases that can actually go out and drink.  And, Jimmy, you might – have you ever heard of that?  Because, I mean, I know addicts have to give it all up. 
[01:16:00]  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Some people do it.  I mean, that's up to them.  Personally, I don't consider somebody sober if they do that, if they're still smoking pot or still doing it.  But, again, if they – that's not my job to tell them what to do.  I personally, I don't feel that that's being sober at all.  Yeah.  Well, he was completely sober.  Like, he smoked cigarettes.  I mean, when he quit heroin, he doubled up on his cigarette habit.  We'd much rather see him do that, obviously.  But he went probably five or six years without drinking. 
[01:16:30]  And then he would – you know, and still, he socially drinks.  He doesn't get bombed.  He doesn't drink a lot.  You know, only once in a while.  And I thought it was weird, too.  But he still tells me – he's out in L.A.  And he does trailer editing for HBO and doing really well.  He doesn't get the kids apart.  But he still tells me every once in a while.  He goes, oh, of course I'm scared.  I'm scared to death of heroin.  Like, he's just scared that he'll trip over it again one day.  So I think that'll never leave.  Well, I don't know why he's drinking then.  Like, if you're really scared of – because, you know, it doesn't get you until it gets you. 
[01:17:00]  Like, I don't see how someone can stand on the train tracks like that.  Like, you know, people say, like, I'm a good drunk driver.  I don't ever hit anything.  Yeah, until you do.  You never hit anything.  It's not like life has lead-ups.  Like, you don't – like, well, in the law of averages, you're going to, in your car, drunk drive, first into a guardrail, then into a telephone pole, then into a child.  You don't get that linear progression.  Sometimes you're just driving home one night, and all of a sudden there's a fucking dead family attached to your car, and that's the end of their life, and that's the end of your life. 
[01:17:30]  Like, there's not always the lead-up signs.  I tail it away from that scene.  Back up and keep going.  That's what you've got to do.  Right to the car wash.  Right.  But, you know, so hopefully he'll be okay.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  So anyway, that was a good case.  But I'll tell you, I think heroin, it's got to be one in ten at best that survive it.  Oh, maybe.  If I'm an addict, I would say.  Watch out, guys.  All right.  Thanks for sharing.  Holy fuck, Andy.  Jesus.  Joe in New York.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:18:00]  Hi, Joe.  I just wanted to say that the way that these – the way that the bags are, so many bags is – the way the bags come is in ten.  So ten bags is a bundle.  Ten bundles is a sleeve.  So most likely they're going to find –  Some heroin.  Or he threw out 30 bags.  A lot of mortem of heroin.  And, you know, I actually called Jimmy.  He showed a couple months ago that I kicked a five-year habit.  Since then, you know, I've been back and forth a couple of times.  But it really is a crazy thing. 
[01:18:30]  And I'm going to assume also that they're going to find that he was mixing stuff.  Because it usually starts off where it's heroin.  But most of the time, heroin's not going to kill you straight up.  You probably mix it with a bag of Coke or whatever the case is.  Because I've had, like, three or four friends die.  It's always that.  They found RX meds, too.  I don't know what that exactly is.  But who knows?  You could just have a heart attack.  It could be so many things.  Why do you end up mixing?  Well, because, you know, eventually you can only get so much heroin when you start losing your money on heroin. 
[01:19:00]  So you say, let me try to mix it.  I mean, I never personally mix it.  I never even shot it.  I always just put it up my nose.  But people who shoot it, I've been around plenty of people, and they say that you can't get the same high.  So rather than spending $500 a week to try to keep the heroin habit going, you grab, you know, $50 of heroin and $50 of Coke and mix it together.  And it's supposed to be this, like, phenomenal thing.  I don't know.  I never did it.  So I couldn't tell you.  And you're saying they're going to find more than 70 bags in there?  Yeah, because 70 is a weird number. 
[01:19:30]  It's either going to be 100 or it's going to be 10.  And you're not going to just go buy seven bundles.  You know what I mean?  You're going to buy a whole sleeve.  Well, he may have bought those.  He may throw them out when he's done with them.  Yeah, he might have already started cleaning up here and there.  Right, exactly.  And the way the needle's always in your arm is because it becomes such a – you're not even shooting up to get high anymore.  You're just – it's just part of the day, just like smoking, Jimmy.  You know, like after you have a – after you eat, you've got to smoke.  After you do this, you've got to smoke. 
[01:20:00]  It's the same thing.  You just – you know you're supposed to be shooting.  It's maintaining.  Shooting and keep shooting and keep shooting and you don't even realize that you're not getting high anymore.  You're just not being sick.  So you're – you spend your whole life not being sick.  And then eventually it either – you do too much and this is what happens or you start mixing it or whatever the case is.  And Xanax and heroin is a bad combination because it's just the downer on top of downer on top of downer.  And Xanax can kill you by itself.  So Xanax and then shooting up, you're guaranteed to go. 
[01:20:30]  It's like 99%.  Yeah, when you're just doing that just so you don't get sick, it's almost like – we talked about Mickey working bar flight the other day.  Yeah, yeah.  Put the tie around his neck like just to stop shaking.  Like when you're at that point, it's like it's – there's no fun.  You're not enjoying it.  It's not like, wow, party time.  No.  You're like, well, I don't want to vomit on my easy chair.  Right, so you don't feel like shit.  Wow.  But honestly, you lose the fun of it.  The fun is gone after a month, literally, if that.  Depending on how much you do, the fun part of it is gone after a month and then it just becomes not being sick. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  Seriously, your whole life revolves around not being sick.  I mean, you go to work and you're thinking about when you're going to get your next fix because you're already feeling like shit six hours after you just did something.  I mean, you can't go two, three hours without having something.  So someone like him who's got money like that, the shooting never stops because once you're that far gone, you could go 10 minutes, 12 minutes, you start sweating and feeling like shit and you need more. 
[01:21:30]  When you look at like – when you look at people who are sober, like nice heroin addicts or people that we know that are sober, these are all the same people.  Like maybe like the same group of people that would smash an old lady's fucking teeth in to get high.  Yeah.  And it's like you look at what it makes people do to get it.  Like look at how – some of them are animals and completely, you know, worthless.  But there are people that when you look at them when they get clean and sober, it's like, wow, that's a decent enough guy.  Yeah, yeah.  But that guy also would have picked up a rock and fucking caved in somebody's head to get money.  To get money, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  You see how far it takes people away from their humanity.  Yeah.  It's a crazy thing.  It really is.  It's just a downward spiral and, I mean, you know, stealing money from your parents.  You know, I mean, if I could tell you stories for hours, guys, it's not even worth it.  But I'm sure everybody can.  So whatever.  Yeah.  The phones are ridiculous.  They are just lit.  All right, guys.  Have a good night.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  No one's ever found with the joint still in their mouth.  No.  Oh, and he was found with the joint still in his mouth. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, I get it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Weed.  Hey, first, I wanted to say I will be seeing little Jimmy Norton at the Borgata.  Oh.  Oh, which one are you coming to the 14th?  Good, buddy.  We'll all be there.  All right, Jimmy.  I think it's a little hypocritical.  Well, as we all know, if you do a drug, the actual chemical in the drug is not what gets you high.  It releases endorphins or dopamine from your brain.  That gets you high, which is the same high that you get when you are with a prostitute. 
[01:23:00]  So for you to say that you don't consider somebody sober because they smoke pot, but you still feed your own sexual addiction and impulsion.  So you should.  It's not hypocritical.  No, no, no.  It's not.  I'll tell you why.  You're self-sober.  No.  Well, you know what?  In a way, you're right.  Sober, to me, being a sober person has a certain spirituality to it and a certain evenness and calmness.  And a lot of that I don't have.  So you could say my sobriety needs a lot of work, and you'd be right.  But people who compulsively overeat who also get that dopamine drip, I consider them sober. 
[01:23:30]  We're talking about from drugs and alcohol.  Like, I'm not justifying it morally, saying I'm better than the heroin addict, but you typically, we know the difference between what people do when they're high and drunk and what it causes you to do, and what you do when you compulsively overeat.  Like, again, we can play the semantics game.  Yeah.  But have you ever seen anybody fucking eating pound cake and run into a family of eight?  Yeah, there's a difference between an endorphin or dopamine fucking high and drinking or doing drugs. 
[01:24:00]  You know, it's not the same exact thing.  Yeah, I don't go through DTs when I don't jerk off.  Yeah, I get cranky, but I don't vomit.  I don't get dope sick.  Well, somebody who has a food addiction could have a heart attack behind the wheel and kill somebody.  Again, yeah, if you want to play semantics games just so you can win the argument, sure.  But you do know the difference.  I win any arguments.  16-year-old Jimmy.  Okay, that's the point. 
[01:24:30]  You know the difference.  You'd be saying I'm being hypocritical.  You know the difference between someone drinking and getting high on heroin and somebody jerking off a compulsive overeating.  I'm not saying morally, but you know the difference.  My point is chemically, when it comes down to it, you're having that same release in your brain as somebody who is getting,  high off the drug.  Okay, maybe you're right.  It is different.  There is a gray area there, but okay, I just wanted to point that out.  No, that's why I consider it.  I'm not trying to say that I'm more sober than that guy because I'm better. 
[01:25:00]  If I was drinking beers, I would not be sober.  I wouldn't be sober.  If I was smoking pot, I wouldn't be sober.  Are you still there?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm still here.  Are you going to still see a little Jimmy Norton at the Regatta?  Of course I'm going to still see a little Jimmy Norton at the Regatta.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  If I was going to, if I was sexually sober, quote unquote, and being healthy, then yeah,  jerking off is a relapse.  Sex addiction is a weird fucking sobriety. 
[01:25:30]  But jerking off would be considered a relapse in that situation?  That's so weird to me.  It depends on what you are.  They have something called bottom lines.  Right.  Which it's different.  It's not all or nothing.  Like it's not all or nothing with food.  It can't be all or nothing.  But instead of acting out sexually where you're banging all these broads behind your wife's  back or girlfriend's back, but now you're not doing that, but you're jerking off.  That's, that's not.  It depends on your addiction.  It's so weird.  It could be like getting high.  Right.  If you're jerking off for six hours and you're supposed to be fucking picking up your kid  from school, then there's an issue. 
[01:26:00]  If you're just spanking one out, you know, to get rid of the poison, as you say.  That's why sex addiction and food addiction are very hard.  Really strange.  Yeah, they're really tough, man, and you kind of need both those things as a human being.  Yeah, because you can't not think about sex.  Right.  And people who don't do it at all, who are like sexually anorexic, I mean, that's not  fucking healthy either.  Right.  No.  Wow, the video of the body leaving the apartment.  There he goes.  Always creepy, huh?  Yeah, black bag.  That's how you go out in a black bag. 
[01:26:30]  Wonderful.  Let's get it.  Thanks, Chris.  We're going to go on to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  Morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hi, buddy.  Well, we're a little down right now.  I've heard.  We're going to turn this thing around, though.  I promise you that.  Keep your chin up.  After the break, we'll do something fun.  Well, first of all, let me preface this by saying, I guess I swear I'm just lucky in  life.  I've tried almost every drug at one point or another younger days, and I've never been  addicted.  Cigarettes is the only thing I've been able not to kick.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  But I remember hanging out with a couple girls, meeting some guys, and I never knew, you know,  everyone says, I'll never do heroin.  Now, this girl says, I'm going to go to Trenton and get some white.  And I'm naturally assuming it's coke.  I never even heard of anybody doing heroin around me.  In my head, at 18, I thought heroin was only something you shoot.  I didn't know you could snort it.  So she comes back with a couple wines, and we're all drinking. 
[01:27:30]  I take a little bump and wait five minutes, or not even five minutes, two minutes, do  another little bump.  And I put my head back, and I said, man, what fucking kind of coke is this?  And the chick just laughed and said, oh, that's not coke.  That's H.  Within-  Hulk?  I don't know.  I thought it was coke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry.  Somebody puts white powder in front of you and says, snort it.  And you think it's coke.  And within two minutes, I just started throwing up everywhere. 
[01:28:00]  And I'm thinking, oh, yeah.  Did the camera fall over?  That idiot.  Oh, God, Tucker, Max.  Why do you have to bring that up?  Ah, shit.  Now, this chick.  Oh.  All right, so you threw up.  Then what happened?  Now, I have a goatee.  I fucking, without even-  That's a good call.  Being able to get my bearings.  Next, I know this chick is on me, kissing me, and she pulls back, and she's got fucking 
[01:28:30]  puke all around her lips.  Sexy.  And she's licking her lips.  And then she fucking wanted to suck my dick.  Now, dope dick is the reason I don't think anybody should ever get addicted to heroin.  I could not get hard.  She sucked my dick for, I don't know, an hour.  I guess it makes you a trooper, though.  What a horrendous scene.  He's got puke in his goatee.  She's got puke all over her face because she's making out with the dude. 
[01:29:00]  Now, she's sucking his dick.  Sucking his limp dick.  I wish it ended there, but it doesn't.  I can't get hard.  The whole time, she's sucked down my dick.  I can't get hard.  So, I'm like, well, I've got to do something.  So, I start fingering her.  She's laying towards me, and I'm eating her out.  And she looks back and goes, oh, my God.  No one's ever done that.  I was like, you never got fingered?  She goes, not there.  And my fuck, I'm two fingers deep in her ass.  Oh, no.  You are a disaster. 
[01:29:30]  That was my wake-up call, man.  I said, oh, fuck that.  Oh, fuck.  I figured to brighten up this dreary fucking heroin subject a little bit.  There you go.  Love it.  It's a heavy topic today.  A heavy topic.  Thanks, Eric.  Take it easy, gentlemen.  How unbelievable is it?  What an attentive lover.  No kidding.  There's a million other calls, but we can take it, Bram.  Go on to something else.  We can come back to this.  But very fascinating that he kicked a lot of drugs, but he can't kick cigarettes. 
[01:30:00]  Cigarettes, they're a tough one, yeah.  That's a hard one.  Yeah.  Because they're not considered drugs.  They're, you know, for the most part, accepted.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to break.  Pat Cooper's coming in today.  Didn't he retire?  Yes.  So what's this about?  I guess he's not retired from show business anymore.  Oh, okay.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  That was a matter of months ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Pat Cooper's coming in in about a half hour.  Yeah.  All right.  That should be quite interesting. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  To say the least.  Mm-hmm.  So he's got something to talk about.  And yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  So why were the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the Super Bowl?  Because Bruno Mars can't, like, cut it just by himself.  I don't think the.  I think that's what the Super Bowl people were thinking.  Yeah.  The wow factor.  Not quite there like a Madonna or a Beyonce.  I'm not a huge Bruno Mars fan, but he certainly did great.  Yeah.  He was good.  He did great.  And then also the Red Hot Chili Peppers did Give It Away. 
[01:31:00]  It just didn't.  I'm like, why are they there?  That song fucking stinks.  Oh, I like it.  Oh, I give it away.  I give it away.  Give it away.  Give it away.  Oh, you loathed it.  Did you see Flea wasn't even plugged in?  I was about to say that, Charles, you son of a bitch.  That's where I was going with this.  He wasn't wearing a wireless?  Lip sync.  It's a cut down to all the mocky mock.  Flea plays the bass, and he was not plugged in.  He was playing air bass.  I could have used him back in college.  God damn it.  We need a good air bass guy. 
[01:31:30]  Because they do have wireless units.  You sure he wasn't wirelessly plugged in?  Yeah.  He wasn't plugged into anything.  They're saying he wasn't plugged in at all.  Maybe he was just playing acoustic in front of a giant crowd.  And I guess the guitarist wasn't plugged in either.  Yeah, that's what they're saying.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing there in the jack.  Wait, what's that wire under there?  Well, that looks like a wireless jack.  Yeah.  That's not this.  What?  Yeah.  That could be...  They could have...  Who knows?  No, that...  Oh, that's a picture of when he is plugged in wireless? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Okay, so that's where he is playing.  Because it's a different bass.  Yeah.  Unless there's a new technology.  We don't need that thing.  You know, unless they can make it flat against the guitar so it doesn't hang down and just  paint over it?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  But this hit yesterday and no comment from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  They haven't said a word about this.  You would assume they would say, fuck you.  I absolutely was playing.  It's not like it's the 90s where they need some fucking grunge credibility here.  Were they lip syncing or no?  I guess the point is we all know they lip sync, but they have always played along. 
[01:32:30]  But now it's like you don't even have to...  Did he say most motherfuckers don't give a damn?  Well, most motherfuckers don't go downstairs.  I told you, brother.  They don't go downstairs.  Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare.  Right.  That's another one.  I think that's the real one.  I guess they cut that out.  Oh, they did?  Well, they probably didn't sing it.  I think that would be a scandal. 
[01:33:00]  Another scandal for the Super Bowl.  Why don't they lip sync?  It's like you're a fucking rock band.  McCartney didn't lip sync.  He sat there and he sang the songs.  Everything has to be perfect.  You know that.  I guess for time.  What do you mean for time?  The song is the song.  No, I mean for setup and takedown, it's like it's really quick.  There's no sound checking you have to do.  You don't have to check the instruments and equalize the drum mics and all that horse shit. 
[01:33:30]  You just fucking fake it.  Right.  They wheel you out, wheel you away.  Yeah.  But Bruno was great.  And I think Anthony Kiedis is still in shape.  I'm not really sure.  He's bigger than he was.  Well, he's got muscles on top of flab or something.  Like he's thicker now.  He is thicker.  But he's always a thin guy.  Right.  I don't know.  But he's, you know.  All right.  He's got a little of that middle age weight.  Let's see how that Bob Levy.  Bob.  What's up, man?  That was the worst Super Bowl ever, man. 
[01:34:00]  Didn't like it.  That was.  And I like, thank you, Opie, for telling us to take Denver, you fuck.  See?  I didn't take Denver, you motherfucker.  Opie's saying he wanted to.  I took fucking the Seahawks.  The Seahawks.  But I say it was.  I finally got one right.  I haven't picked a Super Bowl in years.  I want to find audio of that.  Motherfucker.  I remember Denver.  I heard you saying that, man.  Listen, guy. 
[01:34:30]  Listen, guy.  Hi, pal, fella.  That shit ain't working with me, guy.  I took the Seahawks.  I know I did.  Did you think that guy Bruno was good?  Yeah, for the music he does, sure.  As a performer, you could go, okay, he did great.  What kind of music is that?  You know?  It's not for you, Bob.  Yeah, it's pop.  He had a retarded fucking haircut.  He looked like a retarded Ricky Ricardo.  And the fucking, they got all the little girls dancing in front of the stage.  I was hoping the stage fell on him. 
[01:35:00]  So it's all about.  It's fucking a horrible set of bullshit.  It's pop music for the little girls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrible.  Dude, it's to keep people watching, like, it's almost geared at a different demo.  Like, you know, like McCartney is for Super Bowl people, but like Bruno Mars and Madonna,  they're geared for people that are probably not giving a fuck about the Super Bowl that will stay on that station for that time.  Well, it worked.  It did 111 and a half million people, making it the most watched event ever in the U.S. 
[01:35:30]  They expected a good game out of that.  And fucking Manning couldn't hit a fucking pass.  Everything was left, right, high, low.  And fucking they could read him so easily.  I was able to read the plays they were going to fucking do.  Well, you know, he's got a stiff neck, though.  You know, you can't really fake shit when you've got that stiff neck.  He was a bust.  I think that after that snap went over his head, that just put the whammy on that team where they just were like,  everything is going to go wrong.  And it did.  Wow.  And let's not forget, the Seahawks are amazing. 
[01:36:00]  They're an amazing defensive team.  That's why I picked them.  When they hit guys, did you hear those fucking hits?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it was amazing, their defense, how they were fucking on them,  and the hits that they were fucking putting on Denver.  Like, nobody wanted to take a chance of even trying to catch the ball.  That's probably why they were dropping them all.  You know, they only lost...  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, Bob.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  No, I'm just saying that's probably, you know, even though you're strolling a little left and right and that shit,  you reach for it, you're going to get hit. 
[01:36:30]  And the refs ain't going to call shit in the Super Bowl.  Well, the weird thing is, it was a blowout, as we all know,  and it was the most watched event in the U.S.,  and they said only 5% of the people tapped out in the fourth quarter.  Oh.  Why?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to put on?  There's nothing else on it.  Yeah, you just kind of leave it on.  Just leave it on in the background?  Pre-show.  Also, because it was Manning.  When it was Peyton Manning, you still think, like,  this guy is capable of a four-touchdown quarter.  All you need is one touchdown, and then a fumble recovery run back in, 
[01:37:00]  and they're right back in the game.  So that's why people stayed.  I just don't feel like he had a chance at even that.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, the game was...  You knew it was over right off the bat.  You knew that game wasn't even going to be fucking close.  Right.  And he played as bad as his one-eyed, retarded, fucking downtendom brother in that stadium.  Jesus.  And it was fucking horrible.  The offensive language I hear.  My God.  From Robert Levy.  My God.  I don't think we need to bring people's handicaps into a... 
[01:37:30]  Yes, sir?  That was the worst fucking game I've ever seen in a Super Bowl.  That's a fucking disgrace.  Nobody wants that halftime show.  It was 30-something minutes, I'd say.  30-something minutes for the players to sit back in the back and get all fucking...  You know, they've got to stretch the whole fucking time to get back in the shape.  You don't do that to players.  Play football.  It's not a fucking concert.  Play the concert before the fucking show.  We don't want to see those fucking cunts. 
[01:38:00]  Well, I think it's a little too late for that.  I think we all...  I think it's...  We've all accepted that.  That's a losing battle, man.  Yeah.  I think society has accepted a very long halftime for the Super Bowl now.  Didn't they used to just bring out, like, a college fucking band?  Oh, fuck yeah.  And they'd march around and make shapes.  Here's your trivia question for today.  I don't know the answer.  When did it change?  From the basic, who gives a fuck halftime show to, hey, man, why don't we do something with this?  And what band was it? 
[01:38:30]  Does anyone know?  I'm going to say...  It was probably in the 80s, I would say.  This goes all the way back to the 80s, you think?  I think maybe 80s, early 90s.  Yeah.  There's your trivia question today.  When did it all change and with what band?  Where they said, fuck, we could really showcase halftime.  You're with a lady there, Rob.  And why would some of these advertisers that advertise, like, you know what I mean, like Coke and Pepsi, 
[01:39:00]  why do you want to spend all that money when that's what people buy anyway, you know?  You're preaching to the converted.  It's brand recognition.  I guess if they don't keep that brand recognition up, they feel like their sales will drop.  I agree with you.  At this point, I think we all know, you know, Coke and Pepsi.  Yeah, and fucking Doritos.  Like, I'm going to go out and get a fucking bag of that bullshit.  Go fuck yourself.  I remember the time that commercials were kind of, dare I say, fun to watch and stuff. 
[01:39:30]  I don't remember the last Super Bowl where I sat there and went, oh my God, did you see that commercial?  I think out of habit we all just say that and think the commercials are that amazing still.  I think there was one funny one yesterday, but I forget what it was, and there was only one.  The best commercial ever was the one with the horse that the guy, you know, grew up with,  and it came running to him at the end, and it reminded me of when Beth met Howard. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, jeez.  He goes, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  He just goes, sorry.  Sorry.  He had to say it.  I love you guys.  Sorry.  He just quickly goes, sorry.  I think the commercials that you really liked was the Sarah McLachlan making fun of herself.  That was pretty good, I thought.  Oh, I didn't see that one.  I don't even remember that one, but there was one good one that made me actually laugh, man. 
[01:40:30]  And the other ones were like, this is like, it was just such a fucking bad five hours that I want back my life from the fucking NFL.  No, they didn't send them a video chat.  No, that ain't going to happen.  No.  I know.  All right, Bob.  I think the first time they went with it for halftime, I'm going to go with Super Bowl 27.  I'm going to go with the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. 
[01:41:00]  No.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck!  That wasn't the first one.  No?  They started fucking around with the thing back in 73.  No, what?  They added Andy Williams to the marching bands.  Oh, Andy Williams and the marching bands.  Right, so they start fucking around a little bit.  So, technically, that's the answer.  Who the fuck is watching that drivel?  But then they were going back to the marching bands and kind of coming up with People performed two years in a row.  Up with People was a big thing. 
[01:41:30]  That was 81 and 82.  What's up with People again?  Oh, yeah, they're just being people.  It's a bunch of dumb fucking young white kids singing, I think.  Oh, all right.  It might have been black, too.  I don't know.  And then they kind of gave up on the whole thing in 87 when it was George Burns, Mickey Rooney, Grambling State University, and the USC marching bands.  Holy shit.  What a delightful show.  That was 1980s.  And Disney characters.  That was 87.  Then 88, it was Chubby Checker and the Rockettes. 
[01:42:00]  But you could see what they're doing slowly.  Yeah.  Chubby Checker.  Jesus.  89 sounds terrible.  Why?  Elvis Presto and the South Florida area dancers with 3D effects.  All right.  That was 89.  That's like 89.  That doesn't make sense.  That sounds like shit from the 70s.  Right.  It's not, you know.  All right.  Keep going.  When was the big...  91 was NKOTB.  When did we get A-listers? 
[01:42:30]  I mean, NKOTB in 91.  New Kids on the Block?  That's it.  That's right there.  That's the A-list.  That's the one.  New Kids on the Block in 1991 changed it forever.  What was the year before?  Who was the year before?  The year before was Peter Fontaine or Fountain.  I don't know.  He does not get that halftime show.  Doug Kershaw, Irma Thomas, Nichols State, Irma.  Oh, there's a university marching band.  All the way to 1990, though? 
[01:43:00]  And then 91, New Kids on the Block.  They had a bunch of hits.  That was the big one right there, then.  Yeah.  It was New Kids.  Yeah.  Let's say it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  So it was 91.  Oh, I heard that before.  The right stuff.  So that's 23 years ago.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Colin Quinn.  Colin.  Oh, Colin.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Colin.  I just had to join in on a Super Bowl conversation.  I think it was a blowout from early on, you know?  Yeah.  I think they got off on the wrong foot with the safety. 
[01:43:30]  And then, you know, it just got worse from there.  And then second half started off.  Oh, yeah.  That fucking run.  That was the end of the game.  You can come back from 22-0 or whatever.  But that run back, they were finished.  Yeah, if you can't change that momentum.  They scored six touchdowns.  They might have came back after that.  But then they scored another one.  You had another one in the other quarter.  I don't know.  I know it sounds like kind of rudimentary, like people are crashing into the fucking  turnpike right now.  So to me, I think it's important. 
[01:44:00]  And then everybody also commented on how lucky everybody got with the weather.  Right.  Oh, thank God.  We missed it by a day.  We were in a deep freeze.  Holy fuck.  We did have bad weather.  God, we were all praying for yesterday's weather.  And it was a very mild day for the Super Bowl in Jersey.  And then the snow didn't start until yesterday.  So it all worked out for the best, didn't it? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  You better change this fucking subject right now.  Do a little Super Bowl wrap-up talk, huh?  Super Bowl.  That's right.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  Yeah.  We could talk about Philip Seymour Hoffman.  We did.  They found 70 bags of Huron.  I know.  Little fucking tiny bags.  Little teeny little starter bags, right?  I think one would have been enough to kill him.  Sure.  That's all he needed.  Very tragic.  Another genius.  Was he an American treasure? 
[01:45:00]  Uh, well, I actually knew that guy, so I really did like him.  Oh.  Now I'm uncomfortable.  Let's see.  Now we're talking about one of your...  Well, you told us to change the subject.  Well, you're funny until it's somebody you know, right?  Did you really know him?  Did you know him well?  No, not that well, but I knew him a little, yeah.  How'd you know him?  Just from around...  Yeah, I met him in SNL a few times.  I knew some friends of mine, so I ran to him a bunch of times.  Hey, what'd you think of Jerry's commercial?  Yeah, that's your pal.  Well, I thought it was brilliant and amazing. 
[01:45:30]  In fact, that's what I said to Jerry as I sat next to him watching.  Oh, that's right.  You did watch the big game.  I was at Jerry's house for the big game.  What was I going to go?  Ah, you've done better, Jerry.  Oh, you bet.  That's it.  What great...  The only funny one the whole time.  So you...  Now, was Tom Papa there?  No, Tom P is in L.A., I think.  Oh, okay.  Oh, he's finally in L.A.  I know he moved there, but then all of a sudden he was in New York more. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That was very confusing for a while.  First of all, I was the one who introduced Tom to Jerry to have him open for him many  years ago.  Oh.  But, you know, I'll speak off the record.  Tom is semi out of the loop with Jerry.  Yeah, he is, right?  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, I kind of control Jerry.  You know, I mean, I don't control Jerry, but I'm saying I have the inside dope.  Right.  You know everything that's going on.  Yeah, you control his car when you're pushing it down Mineta Lane.  What's that now?  I said you control his car when you're pushing it down Mineta Lane.  I'm sick and tired. 
[01:46:30]  Can he stay on Twitter every asshole?  That's what you get.  I don't know what he told that story until he became the time.  He's always pushing Jerry's car now.  Yeah, who do you think told Monster Rain?  Nobody snitched on me.  I told it.  Now it haunts me.  What kind of snacks did Jerry have?  I bet he had a good spread.  Oh, he had a lovely spread.  Yeah.  Delicious shit, actually.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah, I kind of, I thought that was, you know, Seinfeld-y.  It was kind of nice. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  I watched the extended six-minute version online.  Was that better?  What's the matter?  You weren't really a big fan there, Ope?  I'd never really watched the Seinfeld.  Of the whole thing, yeah.  Yeah, I'd never watched the Seinfeld.  What the fuck, Opie?  Well, I was doing nights in radio back then, so it was tough to.  That's true.  And you couldn't really DVR things as easy.  You had to fucking get a VHS tape and fucking, I don't know, run it.  I think you had to run it all day and hope you got Seinfeld. 
[01:47:30]  Remember, you used to run it all day and go, wait, this is a six-hour tape, so hopefully  I'll get it.  If it ever comes out on repeat on any stations, I'm going to get you a watch.  Well, I understand it's out there, but if I didn't catch it for the first run, why would  I now jump in?  Well, it's a brand new show now for you.  I've seen a few episodes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What you would have to do with the VCR, by the way, is set the timer that would always  cut off the beginning or end of the program. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  It was very annoying when you'd be watching a show and you see, like, it went over a couple  of minutes and you're like, oh, come on, don't click.  Cuts the end of your goddamn show off.  It happened to me with Duke and Syracuse.  I'd take the whole goddamn game the other day and then Overtime came and I missed it.  Oh, fuck.  Well, sports especially, we all know now, you've got to, like, record the show coming  on afterwards.  Right.  That was a rookie mistake, Colin.  I think people know that now. 
[01:48:30]  A rookie mistake.  That's a rookie mistake.  Somebody explained to Lady Di that I'm not in on Friday.  I said to, like, five DMs and she goes, so are you in?  I go, I'm in New Mexico.  Oh, I'll see you then.  I'm in New Mexico.  I'll see you Friday then, Carl.  Oh, God.  We're very disappointed.  We understand, obviously, but you're not going to be here for Super Show 2, which is Friday,  which means we're just going to have to do another Super Show sooner than later.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  When everybody can go.  I'm excited.  Yeah.  Can't wait.  I'm excited about listening to the Super Show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It won't be the same without you, Colin.  Well, Jimmy, Jimmy's not going to be there.  I know.  No, we kind of want to cancel it, but it's sponsored or something.  Will Daniel Bobo Curlin be here?  Oh, yes.  Great.  Wait, who?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah, that's right.  Bobo's here.  And I got some new pictures for the road trip.  I also noticed that Ohio is where the Football Hall of Fame is. 
[01:49:30]  Why don't we have Lady Di dress in full football gear and see who could run across it?  Do they got a football field by the Football Hall of Fame?  I think they do.  We should try to have everyone that's in the van run across it and try to take a hit from Lady Di.  You know, he should be a pitch guy for you, Carl.  Yeah.  Any ideas you have that has to be pitched, Bobo should do it. 
[01:50:00]  I think you've got to get him in front of Seinfeld because Seinfeld can get things done.  Yep.  I think he could be the new guy.  Take Tom Papa's place.  Yes.  I think I could.  But also I have for Branson, Missouri.  Oh.  You notice how Branson, Missouri, you can't buy beers in Branson, but you could bring beer from outside.  Why don't we bring a bunch of assorted beers and me be the booze master of Branson? 
[01:50:30]  That's a great idea.  That's a great idea.  And by great idea, yeah.  The first one I thought was a little bit, you know, disrespectful to the Lady Di, but this one...  Well, yeah, that one's a good one, though.  Be the booze guy of Branson.  Very good, Bobo.  Thanks, guys.  I'll see you later.  Very good.  Bruce B.  Bear in mind, I respect Lady Di, right?  Well, bear in mind. 
[01:51:00]  I know that.  But we got...  But I just thought that'd be funny to her.  But I also thought...  Jukebox Hero?  Let's keep four of how many beers she drinks.  That's Tommy Shaw, though.  Yeah.  Wait, why is...  Hold on a second, guys.  Do we have another super group on our hands like Asia?  What do you think we do?  Sorry.  Fox News has Tommy Shaw, but then they have a guy that's not the guy from Foreigner singing 
[01:51:30]  Jukebox Hero with Tommy Shaw on guitar, so we were just trying to figure it out.  That guy's voice is fucking crazy good.  Yeah, it was great, right?  And who are the other guys there?  Um...  The other guys?  Yeah.  Wait.  Because who is that?  All right, we'll figure that out another time.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Bobo.  I really apologize that we took up Bobo time.  That's okay.  But anyway, I would say we've got to keep score of how many Natty Ice's Lady Di drinks on the road trip.  Keep score? 
[01:52:00]  Now, what good would that do?  Well, let's see how much Lady...  Because you know how Lady Di has a Natty Ice.  Yes.  But why would keeping score be fun or funny or anything?  I want to see the rate of how much she drinks this stuff.  We've all heard about it.  I'd like to see it.  Well, I disagree.  I'd like to see Lady Di...  When we say Lady Di, there's no drinking on the trip.  She'll do it anyway.  She won't realize...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, if you see a new Lady Di emerge... 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, maybe we'll let her smoke pot if we go to Colorado or something like that.  Uh-huh.  Otherwise, just her in like a pleasant blouse, a peasant blouse, you know, some nice jeans and flip-flops, just kind of being Lady Natural Di.  She's into you, though.  That's right.  She's into you, Carl.  Yeah.  And then also, when we get to L.A., we'll do a movie star map hawker heckling fest.  A what?  What?  You know those Gideons that sell the movie star maps?  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Well, sure.  Heckle them.  You want to heckle?  Like, how would you throw out a heckle like you would?  Remember that message?  You have to heckle and smash it.  Hey, Richard, asshole.  Nobody wants your rats to stalk the celebrities.  We want to leave the beat, let the fuck alone.  Yeah.  We?  That's a good one.  We want to be left alone.  We?  Did you say we?  How about if we just go up, and you go up there and just kind of go, hey, I'd like to know, you know, like, where's Hayden Panettiere's home or something? 
[01:53:30]  And you play a stalker.  Right.  Exactly.  Or I could say, hey, do you know where Charlie Sheen buys his Coke?  That's a little edgy.  A little edgy.  Well, that can be a little, you know.  It can be over the top.  It'll give it away.  But if we say something subtle, I'm saying, like, hey, you know, I really like Scarlett Johansson or whatever.  Right. 
[01:54:00]  Yep, I know.  Scarlett Johansson.  And do you know which actresses love to, I don't know, go tanning in the nude in the backyard?  Yeah, that's a little telegraphic.  Yeah, you're going to want to be subtle about it, Bobo.  Colin works so well with idiots.  Oh, yes.  Just amazing.  And then we can have our little commentary about the very Sars and the Walker thing.  Yeah, how would that go?  Yeah, how would that go?  Well, maybe, let's say, let's say, I'm going to think, I'm trying to think, give me a name of a star of the Walker thing that maybe we could say something about. 
[01:54:30]  All right, Cary Grant.  Cary Grant.  What was she known for with movies?  What was she known for?  I would Google her.  Yeah, she did a lot of movies.  I may have seen the movies, but sometimes they don't know the name, but.  Yeah.  All right, what about Paul Newman? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Paul Newman.  Paul Newman, we could say, man, that's a guy that lives on the fast lane of the edge.  I would have walked that road with him on the L.I.E.  That guy, that guy would have got me through traffic.  Colin Munson.  Where were you saying that?  Yeah, where were you saying that?  On Hollywood Boulevard.  I would say that at each, like, when I'm right by the stars.  Yeah.  He would see a name and then he would just riff.  Well, I don't know.  Let's go, let's go, let's go Bruce Lee. 
[01:55:30]  Now you're on Bruce Lee's song.  Bruce Lee.  Well, Bruce Lee, yeah, man, that guy would kick some ass.  He'd be like, oh, no, you mess with me.  You're trying to break my neighbor.  You're trying to court some problems, prove down property values.  I'll kick your ass.  All right.  I'd go topical with that, too.  Say, hey, what are you guys putting me in a commercial for right now?  I've been dead to 25, 30 years.  Ah, that's a good one, right?  Keep it relevant.  And now you're walking and, oh, oh, here's John Wayne's star.  John Wayne.  Yeah, John Wayne, that's a man. 
[01:56:00]  That man could, that man could, like, be at the West.  He'd be like, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to create this town.  I'm going to kick your ass.  And that guy would probably serve his country.  And he'd kick those bad guys.  Like, like that, that, that, uh, Ahmad Denejad guy and stuff.  He'd be dead like that.  He'd be on the plane doing like that.  All right.  How could you, he wouldn't be afraid to smack his wife.  Wait a minute.  How can you screw up so many simple things and you pronounce Ahmad Denejad? 
[01:56:30]  We all think that.  How the fuck does that happen?  Oh, shit.  Half the newscasts in the country stutter.  Yeah, yeah.  He sends it out like he speaks, like he's a Persian, you know.  It's amazing.  Yeah, but the thing is, what were you trying to say?  He said Ahmad Denejad accidentally.  Yes, yes.  Now, Bubba, what would this do? 
[01:57:00]  He was trying to talk about that slave ship movie years ago.  Retardation is cruel because that, that was supposed to be used to tie his own shoes, but  it comes out another way.  Comes out a whole nother, yeah.  Right.  A whole nother talent.  Oh, I really thought of that, that that guy would kick some ass.  All right.  Right.  That guy would kick his ass.  Yeah.  So we have one more celebrity.  Robin Williams does John Wayne in that commercial, in that football commercial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should we go one more celebrity?  One more.  We're walking.  We're walking.  We got, oh, Marilyn Monroe. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, Marilyn Monroe.  Oh, what do you think, Bubba?  Man, that is some smoking hot beauty.  I would love to go into a time machine and bang that.  She was like, that was like classy and freaking smoking hot.  I'd love you to bang her now.  You would fight off Joe DiMaggio?  Yeah, I would.  I'd say, yo, Yankees suck.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I'm sure that's what she said right before she got a shiner. 
[01:58:00]  I think she said that after an 8-1 loss to Baltimore.  Fucking took a knuckle sandwich.  Well, this sounds great.  It's gearing up to be a heck of a trip.  Yeah, the road trip is, all right, well, we're in the planning stages, but it's going well.  Yep, it's slated for June.  Slated.  Slated for June.  What happened in March or April?  Well, Colin has a lot of schedule, a lot of gigs all over the place.  Oh, he's got to make some time. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to be flexible.  He's trying, Carl.  Come on.  Yeah, Carl.  You're difficult to work with, Colin.  I appreciate it.  Oh, my God.  Bobo was in a tizzy all weekend because apparently he inadvertently blocked me on Twitter and then unblocked me.  But then I had to then re-follow him.  And I hadn't re-followed him in a while and he was just in a tizzy.  Yeah, well, what happened was I was trying to buy all the food for the Super Bowl, me and some friends and some relatives. 
[01:59:00]  I'm buying all the stuff for the chili that I'm kind of stressed out.  They don't have the stuff in the supermarket, get crowded like a motherfucker.  And I was already in a, I was in like a stressed out mood that day.  And then all of a sudden I'm just trying to, and I'm finally watching the Super Bowl and I'm relaxing.  And I'm just trying to tweet a little bit into some of my friends on Twitter that are from Seattle with two people. 
[01:59:30]  Don't worry.  I'll send you your posters in this New York exclusive.  It's a cool poster with every Super Bowl ring.  This is just something I'm doing on Twitter.  I just want to be nice to some people.  But anyway, what happened was...  What is he doing?  I have no idea where that went.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What?  Did you blast him on that?  No, it's a phone call.  I was just trying to send a nice tweet to Anthony.  I was saying, hey, I'm having a great time here.  All right.  Wow.  And I hope you're having a great time, too, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you blocked Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  That's what you did.  You blocked him by accident.  And I clicked on the wrong button when I was talking about it.  Yeah, yeah.  You blocked him.  So what?  Block him.  But what are...  Posters.  I was trying to send a tweet.  No, what it is is I found these posters when I was picking up one of my cousins at the airport.  They were giving out these cool posters that had an image of every Super Bowl ring.  Wait, so you're giving out free posters to people in Seattle that follow you?  Yeah, I just wanted to be nice.  All right.  I just wanted to show a nice little appreciation.  Okay.  For what? 
[02:00:30]  For following me.  All right.  It's a nice little appreciation, Anthony.  It's bribing people.  All right.  We've done enough here today.  We certainly have.  Great.  All right.  Yeah, great.  They're going to open up a free course.  But you have a good day.  I'll see you guys at Super Show 2.  And it's a shame Colin's not going to be around.  You'll be dearly missed, Colin.  Well, I appreciate that.  You're doing great.  Thank you.  It's just the way he says things. 
[02:01:00]  It's amazing.  Of course.  All right, Colin.  Thank you.  Bobo hung up.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye, Carl.  Please.  Yeah, bye.  I love that.  I love how he was critiquing Bobo's ideas.  Right.  You know, telegraphing it again.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Pat Cooper next.  I was asked to make sure he doesn't trash Howard Stern.  Oh.  What?  Why?  And I just want to go on record and say that I said I would try. 
[02:01:30]  Right.  But Pat Cooper's Pat Cooper.  Yeah, he's very outspoken, as they say.  I said I would try to the best of my ability to make sure that doesn't happen.  Yeah.  Right?  Pat Cooper.  Uh, here he comes.  What is he doing?  Oh, and his little pal.  His handler.  He's got about his little pal.  His handler.  Hey, how you doing, Pat's handler?  We still don't know your real name.  Yeah, how you doing?  His mishandler. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, mishandler.  Fuck yeah.  Hey, Pat.  Pat Cooper.  Hello, Pat.  Sit down.  Welcome.  Good to see you, buddy.  Have a seat.  Nice to see you.  My friend.  Nice to see you, Mr. Cooper.  Absolutely.  And fight them all.  Oh.  A nice bottle of water if you're careful.  I'm good, Pat.  Yes.  How are you?  Don't pamper me.  Oh, you know, you're a guest.  Never pampered.  Never pampered.  How are you out there in America?  Everyone is great today, I guess.  It reminds me of my pecker. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, his mic's a little limp.  He's long and black with a silver tip.  His mic's a little limp.  I'm deaf anyway.  Yeah, well.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Pat.  Good morning, O.B.  What's up, Pat Cooper?  How are you?  Nothing is up.  I just had nothing to do with snowing.  Yep.  It certainly is.  I was taking another hour in bed.  Yeah.  But I, your show needs help.  Well, we're doing good.  Pat comes in to help us.  And what I found out was very shaky.  What happened?  Uh-oh, what happened?  That you guys can be heard 24 hours forever.  I'd rather fucking kill myself. 
[02:03:00]  I think this country has now proven they're in the toilet.  You don't deserve that, and he don't deserve that.  What the fuck?  We figured it would be better if the show just replayed.  It's not better.  It's a fucking tremor.  Your guy's starting wars.  It's beautiful.  We need better music.  Meta music?  We need better music.  Nice stuff.  Violence and harps.  We don't want to hear this bullshit anymore.  It's over.  Plenty of time for harps.  No, no. 
[02:03:30]  No, well, you're not going to go there anyway.  That's true.  He's got a shot because he has kids.  You should start adopting.  Nah, nah.  I'm good.  He takes up kidding him.  He knows why you got kids.  Because you feel, you know, you want to be loved.  What's wrong with that, Pat Cooper?  No, nobody fucking loves you.  I live in the same neighborhood.  He goes past the sandwich shop.  They close the door.  How you been?  Good.  How was your lasagna?  The last time I saw you, you had all sorts of bags and you were making lasagna. 
[02:04:00]  It was so good.  It was photographed.  Yeah.  I make good food and I give it away because I have no hobby.  I have no hobby.  Yeah.  So I do maybe 22 cutlets.  I do.  I do lasagna.  I make a ton of soup, but I go, I get a Jewish chicken.  See, people don't know about Jewish chickens.  I go down to Delancey Street and I get a schmatzke.  A big Jewish chicken.  It's got a big beak.  It costs about $3 more, but the fat, when you put it in the water, the fat just comes 
[02:04:30]  off the chicken and it's soup.  Ah.  It's soup.  When you get an Italian chicken, it's for roasting.  It doesn't give off nothing.  Ah.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to put oil on there, a little basil, a little oregano.  But Jewish soup is the best.  I don't care.  And then what do you do with all this food?  Excuse me?  What do you do with all that food?  Well, there are people who play golf.  Uh-huh.  There are people who go swimming.  I like to go in their kitchen and break balls.  All right.  I got a double freezer because in case we have snow, I'm covered. 
[02:05:00]  So you stock up?  It's called giving of yourself.  Not listening 24 fucking hours of your life.  I wouldn't pay $12 to listen to you for five minutes.  But I'll tell you what, I'll give you $1,000 a week to cut it off.  That's what I call friends.  But why are you on the show then?  No, no.  This is not a show.  Oh.  This is aggravation.  If you fucking think this is a show, you guys are jerking off. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  We've been tricked into thinking it's a show for a long time.  Yes.  A show is watching a movie.  A show is going to the theater.  Yeah.  This is aggravation.  This is grumpy.  You represent grumpy.  Yes, they do.  I don't like it.  Don't ever interrupt me when I finish.  Jimmy.  You're absolutely right.  I was just trying to add an aside, but that was technically an interruption.  Ah, shit.  Anyway, what's important is to pick up a paper a couple of days ago. 
[02:06:00]  And I read the paper like anybody else.  And then I start getting phone calls.  What do you think of Howard Stern's birthday?  And I says, well, I don't think about it.  And who gives a shit?  It's none of my business.  All right.  He said, was you invited?  I says, no.  He would never invite class.  He invites horse shit.  I said, number one horse shit is Jimmy Kimmel.  See, they all hate Leno.  Right.  Because Leno happens to still have the numbers over all of them. 
[02:06:30]  So they're jealous of numbers.  Always remember that.  Kimmel is a coward.  I mean, Kathy Griffith, who attacks everybody, either her mother and sister and aunts,  but ain't got the balls to attack Howard, because Howard is the leader of shit.  And they analyze shit.  Oh, boy.  Now.  Oh, boy.  Now.  Now.  He's in there now talking about his birthday.  He trod.  I don't.  I don't have Cyrus. 
[02:07:00]  Not because I don't want it.  I don't give a shit.  I'm deaf.  So I have a reason.  So you can't hear it.  I mean, I can't fucking hear my records.  I gave them away.  So what I do is I understand who I am.  Howard don't know who the fuck he is.  Jimmy, don't have a raise.  That means you're going to go to the bathroom.  Well, I just wanted to say, I heard it was a great, great birthday party, Pat Cooper.  You heard wrong.  I heard it was a terrific time.  You know why you heard that?  I also heard it was a great broadcast.  Listen to me.  I hope the president would have went this center of my fucking business. 
[02:07:30]  I'm still talking that a man that had that birthday party is still full of shit.  And he's not a nice man.  He don't know how to be nice.  And the people who support him are scared of him.  This is how Hitler started.  Oh, wow.  He's scaring people out of their fucking bread, bitch.  Hitler's stern.  Now, he's got guys now urging him on in the room.  This is supposed to be a talented man.  They've got to be careful what he says because he's associated with NBC, which is called nice 
[02:08:00]  spin cock.  That's what that stands for.  Nice big cock.  So he's turning around and he wants people to say, I can't say that.  No, I can't talk about sex.  So he gave up his base.  He gave up his soul, this fucking dog.  That's what he did.  And I tell you, all those people that would get on a plane, I would rather go to the Bahamas.  At least I get a suntan.  He said, and now getting back to you guys.  Had I turned around and been in your shoes, I'd have fucking climbed on him because he's 
[02:08:30]  got no right to tell you guys how the fuck to live in our great country.  This is why I turned around.  I started to like it to see if you had any balls to go after this guy and tell him to  go fuck himself.  I think we've climbed on him.  No, you've got to stand up for your dignity.  What the fuck else do we have?  Dignity.  That's right.  Now, we get divorced, we fuck broads, we do this, we do that.  What do you do?  That's what we do. 
[02:09:00]  You can't say, oh, I didn't do that.  I did it.  When they say to you, hey, David Letterman proved the point.  We understand that you fucked around behind your wife's back.  What did he say?  Yes.  And they forgot about it.  They forgot about it.  Nobody said nothing.  None of them said, did you eat pussy?  Yes.  And that was the end of it.  They go, shit, now we can't go after pussy eaters.  Why?  Because he made it dull.  Yeah.  You see?  Now, the curse words don't mean shit anymore.  Point. 
[02:09:30]  I'm watching your buddy there, Dice Clay.  I like Dice Clay personally.  He was funny when he did the poetry.  I watched him on television a couple of weeks ago.  He's terrible.  He's the fucking worst comic that ever walked out with a jacket trying to be Italian, and  he's Jewish.  Oh, shit.  And I said, I'm talking to the set.  I said, son, son, listen to me.  You lost it.  But he was wonderful in the Woody Allen movie, so he's got to go to that.  Stay away from comedy, because you're a disgraziator. 
[02:10:00]  And a disgraziator, ladies and gentlemen, means you're not funny.  You're a disgrace to comedy.  How fucking dare you go out and say, excuse me, son, is that your wife?  Did you eat a pussy?  I said, who gives a shit?  First of all, the ugliest thing in the world is a pussy.  It looks like a bunch of rolled rubber bands.  That's what you're trying to fuck.  So why are we getting nuts and talking about who's getting laid?  Pat Cooper's getting bad pussy out there.  Now, my friend Anthony here went to a tremor with his marriage. 
[02:10:30]  It's over.  Don't hate her no more.  Just hope she gets a cramp.  I never even think about her anymore.  Yes, you do.  You thought about her just now.  That's right.  When you heard the word pussy, your fucking hat went up.  Well, you reminded me of her.  No, I don't remind you of you.  I had a wonderful time.  Let's talk about the day you said, I love you.  Let's talk about the day you said, I'll kill for you.  I was drunk.  All right, I'm drunk now being on this show.  This is what Cornflakes does to me.  It was great. 
[02:11:00]  No, but when I'm a bad hat.  Now, every paper picked up on the Stern party.  Sure.  But this actor that died, we lost somebody that had a fucking feeling, that had a great acting ability.  And to wind up with the drug shit, and Stern, without drugs, is on drugs as far as I'm concerned.  So they're worried about Stern, giving him paper shit, and about his story.  What has he done in this country that we got to stand up and salute him to being a genius? 
[02:11:30]  He's an evil son of a bitch, and made money on it, and I would love him if he say, I am.  Burn a fucking prick.  But he's got no balls, and now he's got people helping him talk.  He's got people helping him talk.  He don't want to lose the NBC shit.  So now he became who he was.  He's not being bullied by a bigger name called NBC.  He's got to do what they say. 
[02:12:00]  So he's a fucking coward.  How about that, you fucking fans?  He's a coward.  Are you raising your hands again?  I'm raising my hand because you can't hear.  Who can't?  I was told, can you try and not have Pat Cooper trash Howard Stern?  I shouldn't do it.  I don't care.  Who said that?  Listen to me.  I'm not trashing him.  I'm telling you he's full of shit.  He told everybody he was full of shit.  He went after people's family.  You go after his family, he cried. 
[02:12:30]  He's a fucking baby.  I'll go after him 24-7, and I don't give a fuck what fans you had.  I was his best fucking guest.  The only one that didn't take his shit, and he's a spy.  You see that guy that's in Russia?  He's not a spy.  He's an American.  This guy, Howard, is a spy.  He has people out there finding everybody's personal life.  If you talked about his children, he went fucking crazy.  Now he don't want nobody to even know he has children.  Now he's separating his life.  I don't have a family. 
[02:13:00]  I'm not Jewish.  I'm just me, a blob.  And the people are following a fucking blob.  And you people in America who like him, that's your privilege.  I did his show.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I was the best fucking guest to tell him.  You were a great guest back in the 80s and 90s, and you didn't get an invite?  No, but I learned a lesson.  I quit.  And I said, Pat, it's over.  Now you've got younger guys.  It's a new world.  Howard wants so fucking bad to be recognized. 
[02:13:30]  I don't think he paid for that birthday.  I think they chipped in.  What's that?  That's what I think.  Am I right?  I think the company paid.  But wait, so he retired from Howard's show, and that's why we got him.  No, no.  I will never.  This is my last.  I'll be.  This is my last time here.  No, no, no, no.  That's it?  You're retiring?  You said that last time.  No, no.  No, I didn't say that last time.  I knew it had one more coming.  Oh, yeah.  So fucking hope you don't get it.  Nobody understands.  Here's a man on my left.  I mean, he's a funny, a wonderful man.  Thanks, Pat.  He's still got class. 
[02:14:00]  There's no class out there.  And again, with Dice Clay, I personally, I like him.  But Dice, you're a good actor.  Get off that comedy.  You're a disgraziata.  I disagree.  Dice, and I'm not saying that because he's my friend.  I love him as a comic.  I really do.  Well, because you're lonely.  That's true.  I am lonely, but I do love him as a comedian.  Listen to me.  I love you.  You have a right to love him and like him.  But what I saw on that television, I'm not a prude.  I've read all the language.  But he has no rhythm. 
[02:14:30]  He has no feel for being funny.  He ran out there like he wanted to.  And I'm saying, wait, you're not getting the laughs you're supposed to.  You can't go back to the old shit.  Now, the kind of money he made, he should have got a whole brand new act.  So go for a million fucking dollars.  That would bring him another 20.  But he's a cheap son of a bitch.  He don't want to change.  I would turn around.  I don't need a writer because I'm a brilliant fucking comic.  I got things to say 24-7.  I should get a network.  Not these fucking guys.  These guys should be on slides. 
[02:15:00]  And see how many people would turn them on.  Slides?  See, if they came in this building now and looked at you two, they would never believe you're  Opie and Anthony.  Why is that?  They would believe you're Phil and Toto.  That's who they would believe.  Why?  Because you don't look like an Opie and Anthony.  Well, he looks a little bit like an Anthony.  You don't have no Opie and you.  Well, of course not.  It's a kid's name.  Yeah.  I fucking hate the name.  Well, you are a kid.  Well, I try to be a Pat.  But your kids are wonderful.  Now, I got to tell you.  Thank you, Pat Cooper.  You've got great sperm.  I make good kids, right?  He does have great sperm.  Might be more my wife than me.  But that's the story. 
[02:15:30]  It's delicious.  So now, when you're 60 at birthday, you go on and you put it on television.  Was it on television?  I don't know.  On radio?  Whatever.  Because he wants to be loved.  They want us to step in.  He's got to first start with his family to love him.  What are we going to do?  When you start with your family to love him.  I think his family still don't know what the fuck he does.  Why are you looking at that for?  Well, they want us to step in every time we're talking about Howard.  So I'm trying to step in.  Oh, we said that.  All you've got to tell them is, if they don't like it, turn it off.  I told them, look, you're your own person and you're going to say whatever you want. 
[02:16:00]  You can't tell a guest what to talk about.  Listen to me.  I'll say it again.  They've got a right to like who they want.  Sure.  If a guy said to me he likes Hitler, that's none of my fucking business.  I won't like him.  You're sitting two people away from him.  As a Jew, it should be your business.  Opie.  Yes, Pat.  What's wrong with this country is happening when we lose a man on drugs 46 years old.  That's what's wrong with this country. 
[02:16:30]  There's no more character, no more dignity.  Howard was trying to prove a point that I was not a nice man.  I'll never be a nice fucking man.  And the only one telling me is Pat Cooper because Pat Cooper's got the balls to stand up to me because I'm not big with Pat Cooper.  I'm a snail.  That's what it is.  So if his fan base loves him, God bless you.  Where did it go wrong with you two?  Where did it go wrong with you and Howard?  Oh, it's obvious.  I found out he's full of shit. 
[02:17:00]  It took you a long time.  And wait a minute.  And wait a minute.  One day I was on his show and he said, I heard you talked about me.  I said, yeah.  And he played what I said.  He said, did you say that?  Well, how would you?  Of course I said it.  You got it on tape.  And who the fuck are you to go around taping people?  I remember that.  I remember that episode.  No, but I'm saying, why are you going around?  Look, I mean, that's unfair.  Like if I talk to you on the phone, and you say to me, you know, yes, yes.  And then two days later, you come in and I don't know you take my conversation. 
[02:17:30]  That's wrong.  That's why if the people of the Howard clan don't like me, because you're a bunch of fucking cowards,  you believe that nobody's against that man.  He's not a fucking man.  He's a pussy and I don't want him so pussy.  I don't want him so pussy.  He's a disgraceful little fucking, whatever he's worth.  He's nothing.  How many texts do you get?  But you people don't see nothing.  Phone lighten up?  Oh, boy.  And remember this.  Remember what I'm telling you. 
[02:18:00]  Right now, he's got teachers.  He's right now teaching him how to operate under the new Howard Stern.  The new Howard Stern is rotten because you can't give up who you are.  You cannot say I'm white if you're black or if you're black or if you're white.  You're a fucking phony and you're a disgrace.  And all you people who went to his party, that's your privilege.  But you know what's wrong?  You know what's wrong?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't know why they like him. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, is that it?  I don't think they know why they like him.  I know why I liked him at first.  Yeah?  Because he wasn't busting my balls.  He didn't give me any of that shit.  I didn't agree with some of the stuff he said.  Uh-huh.  But this man is 60 years old.  I want to know if he wakes up and says, holy shit, my time is starting to pass.  Uh-oh.  And I am 85, brother.  And I said, hey, Howard, if God makes me 85, you're lucky you're 60.  There must be a saint up there who wants to live to go till you fucking rot. 
[02:19:00]  And you will rot.  But you see, he don't want to hear it.  Because only he said it.  Only he could talk about your mothers, your sisters, your uncles, and your aunts.  And again, I say, wait a minute.  My father.  Huh?  All right.  My father.  He talked about your father?  Oh, yeah.  Did he?  What's wrong with your father?  Well, he's no longer with us.  And he thought that was hilarious.  But continue, Pat.  But you see, had you turned around and punched him in the nose, they wouldn't have defended you. 
[02:19:30]  His fans would have said, how dare you touch Howard?  If they can explain to me why is Howard Howard, the people don't know.  He's a piece of garbage.  He's a walking garbage.  He married a lovely girl who, unfortunately, is a lovely girl.  I met her.  But she's blind.  So what I did, and I swear to God, I donated $110,000 to buy two dogs for the blind people.  She's going to get one of them.  I did.  I donated that. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, there goes the phones that were ringing.  When did Howard donate anything to help anybody but himself?  Right, right.  And here's the irony.  You're all on the same floor.  Yes, we are.  It makes it very uncomfortable every day.  I would come here at 2 o'clock in the morning and lock his doors.  I wouldn't let him in the fucking building.  And I would say, I'm going to tell you, I don't want to prick him in the building here.  And to me, you're a prick.  Go get the cops.  Get me arrested.  And I want you to come to the cops and say I'm a prick.  He ain't got the balls.  Because he's a fucking coward. 
[02:20:30]  You see?  If he saw a policeman, he was shitting his pants.  You were a big part of that show.  You probably should have been invited to the party.  I don't want to.  Look, look, look.  Oh, you're reminding me.  He's just jealous.  He's just jealous.  Oh, you're reminding me.  I quote him.  I quote him.  Yes, Pat.  I says, Howard, you know, why don't you be roasted by the friars?  And he said, well, here's my conditions.  I said, yes.  I will be roasted by the friars if, yes, all the people that hate me, I'm quoting him, are on the dais. 
[02:21:00]  I said, we'll need another building.  He said, everybody that hates me, I want to be on it.  Never went to a friars roast until, until Matt Lauer.  That was my worst roast.  I did a minute.  And people said, what happened to Pat Cooper?  The reason I did a minute, I closed it.  But Tom Cruise, another ball breaker, he opened the show and did 55 fucking minutes. 
[02:21:30]  It was getting dark outside.  What?  And this was a fucking luncheon.  He did 55 minutes.  I swear to God.  And it was not a roast.  He's not that interesting.  It was a corporate.  All the television people were talking about each other.  I said to Matt Lauer, I said, Matt, when it gets to me, I'm going to do one thing.  Goodbye, because I showed class.  Now, here's where Howard was in.  This is what you want to call a prick. 
[02:22:00]  Gets up and tries to get on the dais uninvited.  And they told him to get the fuck off.  And he got the fuck off because they told him he was a piece of shit.  Not verbally, but telling him to get off, he found out that not everybody loves him.  That's when I started to realize, Mr. Prick, I showed up.  Now, we did another roast.  This guy, this director, the guy, the bastard, he wrote the bastard shows.  Inglourious Bastard, Quentin Tarantino.  Quentin Tarantino. 
[02:22:30]  Quentin Towers.  All right, I closed that show.  Howard is in the audience with Robin.  I don't know this and I don't give a shit.  I'm hilarious.  Howard turns around and tells people I was terrible.  Robin Quivens, who I give credit to, says Howard, you're wrong.  The man was great.  And then he said, well, yeah, you're right.  Because you don't want anybody to be right who stands up to him.  He's a fucking warden.  He's a fucking prison.  And he's a prisoner.  He's everything that's crime. 
[02:23:00]  He's a criminal, what he did to people.  And all you fans out there, understand, I got a right to knock who I want to.  And if you don't like it, you're not decent people.  You're fucking lowlifes.  You can love him and not love him, I don't give a shit.  But don't put me down.  Fuck all these.  No, no, never.  Wow, Pat.  At least you worked it out with Wayne Newton.  You and Wayne are good.  Wayne Newton was a nice man.  Hold on a minute.  What?  Wayne Newton was a nice man.  He worked it out with Wayne. 
[02:23:30]  I could get a problem for a while.  Wayne Newton was a giver.  Right.  I bet.  Wayne Newton had a tremendous ego, but don't punish him for that.  On the stage, he delivered him.  He outdrew Sinatra, because he worked there, that town, 45 weeks a year.  Liberace outdrew Sinatra, who was there for...  So, you know, with all due respect to Sinatra, and I love Sinatra, and I love his singing.  Wayne Newton and Liberace outdrew him.  The difference was, Wayne Newton didn't bring in gamblers, nor did Liberace.  Ah, but Frank brought in the heavy hitters. 
[02:24:00]  And Frank worked it three months a year.  Yeah.  He brought in millions and millions of dollars.  Sure.  Wayne Newton would do 45 weeks a year.  He brought in $35.  But that's all right.  That's all right.  But that's all right.  But Wayne was an entertainer.  See?  And now the kids today...  I mean, what's his name?  Beep-a-boo-ba-ba-ba?  The fucking kid.  The Beep.  I think what happened when he was born, they threw away the body, and they kept the spine.  This fucking kid is nuts. 
[02:24:30]  He deserves a spanking, a smack in the fucking mouth, and to walk the straight line, and go  to Canada and move to where it's cold.  Oh, just stay up there in his native Canada.  Why is he breaking our...  You know why?  Because Canada don't take that shit like we do.  No?  We take shit.  Remember?  Oh, no.  Remember?  Sharon Stone was hot as a pistol?  Uh-huh.  And Letterman put her on, and he told Howard he wants Howard, and Howard says, I go on 
[02:25:00]  first, or I don't go.  And I looked at Howard, and I said, what's the fucking difference?  He said, I go on first.  And he told Letterman, and Letterman made him go on first.  And when I did Letterman, I says, why do you allow anybody to tell you how to run your  fucking show?  That was the end of me and Letterman.  Wow.  We're not on Letterman either.  Huh?  We're not on Letterman anymore either, because a call was made by Howard.  That's a true story, too.  He made a lot of calls about hurting.  I mean... 
[02:25:30]  He made a call behind the scenes.  What about our friend there, the joke man?  Matt Lee.  Jackie.  Jackie.  Why didn't he invite him?  Jackie's a good soul.  He didn't get invited to the birthday party?  I find it hard to...  They didn't invite him.  What are you looking at him for?  The man's taking a fucking nap, and you're looking at him?  No, only because he just starts talking with no microphone.  All of a sudden, I hear a sound in the back.  Get over here, yeah.  Because you're a genius.  You can handle it.  Oh, thank you, Patrick.  But you know what I'm saying?  Jackie Matt Lee.  When you talk to Jackie and he wasn't invited, that's kind of great.  Let me ask you a question.  How come you got fans here?  All right.  How come the fans, when they knocked your father, didn't defend you? 
[02:26:00]  They did?  They probably did, right.  They did?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Why don't they do it now?  Hold on a minute.  Why don't they call back now and say, Pat's right?  They were great.  Pat's right.  You know why?  Because you know why?  They're off the wall.  They're semi-retards who love this man because they don't know what they love.  Listen, I told my daughter, my own daughter, you don't know your father.  Cut the shit.  You don't know who I am.  Cut the shit.  Just because you're my daughter don't make you fucking right.  And she was going to come here with my son-in-law and two producers to do my documentary. 
[02:26:30]  And I told my daughter, you're going to spend $100,000 for what?  You come to New York with these two guys, I'll fucking lock your ass up.  That's quote by me.  How can you say I'll put you in fucking jail?  Jeez.  Wow.  Now, wait a minute.  Huh?  Now.  I guess, uh...  Wait a minute.  When she was 16, she wanted to leave the house and go with her girlfriend who was a  piece of shit girlfriend. 
[02:27:00]  What the hell is that all about?  But my daughter didn't see this.  Right.  So I said to my daughter, you're 16, you walk out of this house, I will have your fucking  ass in jail because I'm responsible for your upbringing until you're 18.  Uh-huh.  And she didn't know what to say.  And I reminded her the other day, your mama's going to shove you in jail in Vegas, so shut  up.  Wow.  I said, I'm responsible.  Yeah.  Now it's your...  You got your own responsibility?  I give you money and you want to spend it on me?  I could have got a documentary for nothing, you sick bastards.  How dare you spend the $100,000 that I give you? 
[02:27:30]  Why don't you buy your daughter a candle?  I can't.  We respect you more.  Pat, is there anybody you haven't burnt a bridge with?  Anyone in the business that you haven't completely nuclear blown up a bridge?  You guys.  Us.  Oh, us.  We are the last...  Woo!  Are we the last people that will professionally speak to you, Pat?  Let me put it to you this way.  Joe Biscopo wanted him on, but he wants to do you.  Yes, Pat.  I am very observant, not a genius. 
[02:28:00]  There's a man called Mario Cuomo who was our governor.  Mario.  All right.  Let me bring out something that this fucking country don't pay attention to.  He was the number one to run for president.  When they figured this guy was going to run, they picked on his dead father and said his  dead father was a mafioso.  Uh-huh.  Wait a minute.  What did Mr. Cuomo do?  He says, you don't fuck with my dignity.  Fuck the presidency.  And he walked away. 
[02:28:30]  That's a fucking man.  You're fucking with my father?  He's dead?  He's a mafioso?  Ladies and gentlemen, would Howard Stern do that?  Howard Stern wouldn't stand up for his fucking family.  Just when I thought we were out, he pulls us back in.  We tried.  Yes.  I think the people have noticed we've tried.  I'm right with you.  I'm trying to calm you.  Pat, I hear you.  I'm caressing pets.  You're not sure if you like me yet.  Oh, I love you.  Don't laugh.  I love you.  My phone's vibrating.  Do you understand?  I think I could calm it's vibrating so much.  What happened to dignity in our country? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  No one cares about it.  If Howard would have turned around and said, I'm Howard Stern, I'm the shock crop,  I'm the crappy shock, whatever the fuck he is, and stand by it, that would have gave  him the country.  Now he's telling you, you see, Kim Kardashian would put cement on.  His body, Howard's body can't handle cement.  It can handle horse shit.  But if he put horse shit on his face, all over his body, he would smell and he would  say, I saw that's perfume.  He should have.  He should have invited Jack in the joke, man. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Why?  How come?  I love my God.  Listen, I love Jack.  Jack joke.  May he's a giver.  He's got a good heart.  But Howard is a terrible.  What about all the other people that walked away from him?  But yeah, he's got the stuff.  Oh, one of his quotes was.  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, Jennifer.  Jennifer Aniston and our boyfriend are really in love.  He never heard the word love.  The fuck is he?  I want to yell to Howard. 
[02:30:00]  What does love mean?  What does love mean, you sick fuck?  What does love mean?  He wouldn't go.  Because you have no love.  You're a fucking walking limp.  And I want to tell you something.  He's going to prove me right.  I know.  Will you stop laughing?  I'm on a roll.  You're the only guy in this class.  I'm right here with you, Pat.  No, no, no.  You're smart.  You play with that shit.  This is laughter of joy.  Oh, yeah.  I love listening to Pat Cooper.  No, that's all right.  You know why?  I'm the last of me.  Yeah.  This is your last appearance on our show? 
[02:30:30]  No, he said he's the last of him.  No, but he also said this is it.  Why is this it?  Well, probably because Tim won't let him back on.  Oh.  They tend to do that.  They won't let him on Martin.  Listen.  Just know that it wasn't us.  Listen.  Yes, Pat.  Yes, Pat.  Howard's fan base don't want to know anything against this man.  They really, first of all, don't know him.  They really don't work on the air like I was with him 10 years.  And I didn't double cross him.  I just told him, you've got to tape.  Who the fuck are you the taping people? 
[02:31:00]  And who is these 18-year-old kids walking to sleep?  Do you remember what you were saying that got him upset?  No, yeah.  I must have called him a prick.  I don't know.  But I didn't call him behind his back.  I said, you're wrong.  He went after what's his name?  The guy who used to talk worse than me, yelling and screaming, who died in a car.  Sam Kinison.  They were friends.  All right.  Sam.  Sam, nice man.  Yeah.  All right.  And when Sam stood up to him, Howard said, take a fucking walk. 
[02:31:30]  You're finished with me.  Sam begged to give back.  I went and begged.  I said, fuck you.  Who are you talking to, you piece of shit?  Who the fuck are you to tell me I'm not on your show?  I'll come after you.  I'll bite your balls.  Because he would say that to people.  But a coward.  A coward.  He's a fucking bald bully.  And you people who love him, love bullies.  And let me tell you why we never had gay people a hundred years ago.  We had no closets. 
[02:32:00]  We were hanging our clothes on the doorknob.  That's why these people couldn't come out no fucking way.  That to me is important.  And why am I a natural funny man?  Because I'm scared shit.  Is that it?  I know.  You guys play me?  Yeah.  If they finish this?  Don't play me no more.  Tell your fucking audience you want greatness or bring them back.  If you want to waste our fucking time, go to Howard.  Because he's another.  And play with his balls with his birthday.  I hope the fucking.  I hope the cake had torch shit in it. 
[02:32:30]  That's what I hope.  That's what I hope.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Now they're all up.  Now they're all up.  Let's go against Leno.  I mean, Leno.  Who figured Leno would last 22 fucking years?  22.  You gotta give him that credit.  Wow.  Alright?  You gotta give him credit.  Ratings right to the end too, Pat.  And I guarantee you, if they would have let him alone, he'd have done 30 years.  Yeah.  You see?  Oh, easily.  He's an honest stand-up comic.  He never said I'm an actor.  He never said this.  He was a stand-up comic. 
[02:33:00]  And he lasted 22 years and they throw him up.  He's got the highest rating and they throw him to the fucking rules.  That's the business.  Now.  Now we know that.  Watch Leno.  And Leno's in his six.  Where the fuck's he going?  I mean, how many times can you wash your cars?  You know, he's got about three.  And when he dies, you know, that's his problem.  He's gonna get sick finding out when they tell him, you know, you can't keep your cars.  You're gonna die.  You can't take a car.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I had a friend of mine, my own to God.  The wife hated the daughter-in-law.  The wife. 
[02:33:30]  She buried the son in the fucking Mercedes.  Wow.  And the wife says, where's the Mercedes in the wheel?  She goes, you dig him up.  She buried her son in the fucking thing like this.  Behind the wheel and into the fucking dirt.  That's creepy.  And the guy's still there.  That's so creepy.  That's a mother.  That is a mother.  You're goddamn right.  Well, Leno's not gonna retire.  He'll go somewhere else, Pat.  Huh?  Leno's not gonna retire.  He'll go somewhere else.  CNN.  He's been offered anything he wants.  Right.  But, but, people are very, very into what they like for 22 years. 
[02:34:00]  You take him out of that desk, it may not look like the same desk, the same drapes.  People say, well, it doesn't, they'll find wrong with it.  I don't think, I don't think people give a shit.  We got too many talk people.  You got Wendy Williams.  Then you got this other girl from Florida, from California.  Queen, uh, Queen Mafa.  What's it?  Queen Mafa?  Queen Mafa.  Queen Mafa.  Queen Mafa.  Queen Mafa. 
[02:34:30]  You got her.  You got, uh, who's the other one?  You got another one.  You got somebody on Shackle.  There's a new thing called Shackle.  You got Bethany.  Bethany's doing it.  No, what about the girls that's gonna do the, uh, who?  That's gonna do the, uh, Academy Awards.  Ellen.  Ellen DeGeneres.  Of course, Ellen does well.  She's got great, great things.  She's a giving woman.  She's funny.  I mean, Oprah, Oprah.  Oprah.  Oprah was generous.  Mm-hmm.  And she gave up her big party.  Right.  You know why?  Why?  Because she didn't want to fight with Stern. 
[02:35:00]  Had she would have went and had the party, she should have went the same time.  Here goes the phone again.  She should have had it right opposite him.  Where's the Hammerstein?  Where's the Hammerstein building?  West side.  It's close.  Like 34th Street on the west side.  34th Street.  You're Penn Station.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's what, see?  Near Penn Station.  And let me tell you, wait a minute.  Yeah.  I'll tell you how strong Howard was.  Uh-huh.  They had to stop the trains until the party was over.  No trains could go underneath.  That's big stuff.  Come on.  Of course I'm kidding you.  I'm kidding you.  Sit back. 
[02:35:30]  Gotcha.  You gotcha on that one.  Yeah.  A little slow to get, huh?  A little slow.  I don't understand how you don't bump into each other.  Well, there's, uh...  We have occasionally in the hallway.  Huh?  We have occasionally.  Let me say hello.  Not really.  I've never even seen him.  I've never even seen him in the building.  You say hello and he talks about his father.  Well, not in the same moment.  You can't be who you are.  No?  To him.  You got to be who he wants you to be. 
[02:36:00]  I think they turned off the electricity.  You see that?  Lights are going off.  They probably would.  He's got that kind of...  I'm telling you.  He's got the power.  He has the power still?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Around here, they love him.  They absolutely adore him.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  It's all about Howard.  No!  We learned that a long time ago.  But it's the money!  No!  And they certainly don't like when people bash him.  Anthony, if they love him, it's the money.  I tried.  Yeah.  I did.  It's the fucking...  You heard of my voice, right?  Snapples loves him.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:36:30]  Or whatever advertisers are paying.  I can understand you love him.  You're in a business.  If I was advertising the furniture business and he was a fucking piece of shit and he's  selling my furniture, that's business.  Right.  So I'm not mad at the people who sponsor him.  But if they all walked away, if the dollar stopped, you'll see how fucking fast the dollar  they say, how, how, who, who?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  But that's all right.  He can't take it with him.  But he can take his hate with him.  Oh.  Because he has motherfucker hate. 
[02:37:00]  Motherfucker hate.  The best.  That's deep shit right there.  The best.  Yeah, huh?  That's right.  He hates the best.  Because he wants to get paid for hating.  We have dictators we blew out of the fucking water.  You hear?  Nobody's blowing this guy into the water yet just to teach him a lesson.  You can't badmouth people unless you're ready to be badmouthed.  And he don't want to be.  I wrote a sign out here about a year or so ago that he was full of shit.  He had the thing erased to paint over.  That's right.  I would have put it on his balls. 
[02:37:30]  Because when you hate, I'm going to talk about hate.  I don't hate him, but I want to get him where I want to get him to let him know you  said disgrace.  I took pictures of it, though.  They painted over that?  Maybe they were just painting the wall.  I took pictures.  Maybe they were just painting the wall.  Steve Malsberg on his last day said we're going to paint the Howard saw and he's painting  the walls.  Hey, Pat, what are you working on?  What is he working on?  No, no, no.  Please answer me because he don't know what I'm working on.  What are you working on, Pat Cooper?  Nothing.  I thought he was working on something.  Not allowed to say anything.  Okay.  You're not allowed to say nothing. 
[02:38:00]  No.  You're not retired.  Stop with this retiring crap.  Here's what he wants to do.  What?  He wants me to roast the fucking world.  I got no time.  I got no memory to roast the fucking world.  I want to roast one thing.  I want to roast the fryers because I think that would be hilarious to let the fryers know  what I think of them in humor.  See?  That's a great idea.  Pat Cooper roasts the world.  Yeah.  And you get, you have the memory.  You just, you talk about a few pop culture figures. 
[02:38:30]  You do it as a one hour either show.  My writer.  My fucking writer.  No, let Pat go.  You do a one hour.  It's either a show or a podcast or a half hour and you edit it down so you can kind of  free form and go wherever you want.  Let your brilliant mind go where it wants.  I would, I would want to, see, but what I would do was mention the names.  Of the fryers that I know are not on the money with humor to get my point across.  I would do it, but where am I going to do it? 
[02:39:00]  You know what would happen if I told the fryers, I want to roast the fryers.  They would tell me, do it here because you know why they need the fucking money and they  got a problem with the train going underneath the building.  They got the fucking second air in your subway, which got, which got sirens that'll blow your  balls.  More concerned about the train than Woody Allen's daughter.  All right, here, here.  That dumb toy train she can't look at.  Front page.  I kind of, I like that.  Jesus.  She didn't even let it sit there for a second. 
[02:39:30]  I know.  Let it sit.  It might work.  Well, you know something.  Yes, Pat Cooper.  Listen.  What do you think of Woody Allen?  We got a nice email from Woody Allen.  I don't think of Woody Allen.  You got a nice email from Woody Allen.  Pat sent him a book and Woody told him that he was one of the most hilarious comedians he ever  had.  Oh, wow.  So you're looking the other way.  Listen.  Woody Allen, I'm not his lawyer.  Uh-huh.  I got a family of 50 years old, 50 years, still calling me a piece of shit.  Right.  So they're still calling him a piece of shit.  And it's not going to stop.  So you're insulting the guy. 
[02:40:00]  Whether he did it or not, it's 30 years too fucking late.  Uh-huh.  The train left the station.  Well, the train got a little bit of trains.  The train did leave the station for this, rounded round.  But that kid to come out and even bring this up, how she brought it up when he was seven  years old, that's okay.  But now when she's in her 20s.  Now you think she'll...  Ah, but you know what, though?  Well, where can you bring it up when you're seven?  Yeah, when something like that happens, it's weird.  You go your whole life trying to forget it or to move on.  And then you're constantly reminded because of Hollywood.  I got my family.  I forgot.  It's 50 fucking years.  I got a divorce.  And I did, listen, I obeyed the court's ruling. 
[02:40:30]  Whatever I paid, I paid.  That's from the school of walk it off.  But my mistake was I became popular and they got pissed off.  Old school.  What is your answer?  I think it's different.  You're from old school.  Yeah, Pat's old school.  Old school.  You're old school.  You're like, ah, walk it off.  What's the matter with you?  Get over it.  When I'm sleeping, I don't dream.  I yell.  You're yelling, you're asleep.  You're fucking right.  And here's how I sleep.  I go, and find them all, and then I start to dream. 
[02:41:00]  One of his kids tries to come on here, and I just said, go away, man.  No, you should have come on.  It's the son that wrote the book.  Oh, I don't know.  The kid doesn't understand.  I think he finally gave up.  He was brainwashed at four years old.  I'm a prick.  Oh, shit.  No, my big mistake.  I got successful and they couldn't handle it, and they didn't know what the fuck to do.  So they hate.  I got grandkids I'll never see.  They're hurting the kids.  They're hurting the kids.  Would you like to, if you could make up now and let bygones be bygones, would you? 
[02:41:30]  I'd throw a fucking hand grenade in there.  My fucking hate is permanent.  But I don't want to hate.  I just wish them well.  I mean, I got a daughter.  Wasn't even one years old.  I only saw her when she wanted me to pay for her college.  And I said, fine.  Then she comes into the lawyer's office, walks past me, says to the lawyer, is he paying my college?  Lawyer said, yes.  She walked out and never said hello.  I said to the lawyer, fuck up.  What were these kids told about you?  Yeah.  Huh?  What were they told?  What were they told?  What were they told about you?  Well, divorce is going to be nasty.  I'm a piece of shit. 
[02:42:00]  I deserted.  I lived across the street when I walked away.  I deserted.  They took me to court every five minutes.  Now I'm on Gleason.  They take me to court that Tuesday.  And I showed up.  Now let me show you the mentality of people.  I'm over there and there's a woman going, you son of a bitch.  You piece of shit.  Think you're playing with my granddaughter?  I'll fucking hang you, you piece of shit.  And she says, Pat Cooper.  Oh my God, I love you.  Come over here.  And he's hugging me.  She's calling this guy a piece of shit. 
[02:42:30]  Or the daughter or whatever.  And she's calling me a wonderful guy.  And I'm saying, honey, they hate me.  The same as you hate her or him.  Oh, fuck him.  But you're a good guy.  I said, I didn't understand that.  But that's people.  She's not saying whether I was right or wrong.  Fuck you.  He's a prick.  But you're a better guy.  I paid 21 years each.  I made money.  I made fucking money.  And made money.  And every time they try to get it, I said to the judge, here's my taxes. 
[02:43:00]  What is it?  $390,000.  All right.  What's the next tax?  $487,000.  What is she getting?  $130 a week.  So I said, your honor, I think that's the law.  And I looked at her saying, stupid.  Fuck this court.  Let me do what I want to do.  I want the docket number.  Now, the docket number means when you send, the docket number hits and then they send it to her.  Then one day, I missed for some reason. 
[02:43:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  She got it the next day.  But meanwhile, they had a warrant for my arrest.  Where do you think they sent my warrant?  To a girl called Pat Cooper, who was in a play called Boys from Syracuse.  I should never see my grandkids.  It's all documented.  A girl called Pat Cooper.  She got my summons in her box.  And she calls my lawyer.  She says, I didn't do.  Who's Pat Cooper?  He said, well, she's coming.  Well, I got the thing that he's got to show up in court for lack of payment. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, shit.  And my lawyer comes and says, did you?  I said, you're fucking nuts.  So that Thursday, she already got it.  She never called.  I said, I got it.  So I went to court with the girl.  Oh, you went with Pat Cooper?  No, yeah.  And I said, where's Pat Cooper?  And the two of us stood up.  And the fucking judge says, is this some kind of a charade?  I didn't know what a charade meant at that time.  And my lawyer said, that means they know what the bullshit.  Okay.  And she goes, Your Honor, I got it in the box where I work.  I'm on bus with Syracuse.  What is this a joke?  The fucking judge.  Is this a fucking joke?  And this woman yells out, one of the sisters. 
[02:44:30]  What is he paying you?  What?  Oh, shit.  All right?  Oh, boy.  You talk about sister-in-laws that were tough.  And they ruined it on this girl because she was a good girl.  But she, listen, she was the baby.  And she blew everything.  All right?  So there's your fucking hand.  And meanwhile, I'm wrong that I got to the point where I said, fuck all he is.  You see?  When you say, you know, I love when they go, Pat, I heard about your wife.  And I heard, I don't get that.  Some guy's daughter dies.  I heard about your wife.  Oh, somebody's father. 
[02:45:00]  I heard about your father.  None of them ever called me when my wife called.  So I'm walking them down the street.  They go, Pat.  I go, fuck you.  Fuck you, you motherfucker.  What?  Oh, and your son died.  Didn't I call you?  I gave you my condol.  My wife died.  Oh, he said I was on the road.  You're on the fucking road?  My wife died.  Are you on the fucking road?  That's how it's starting fans would tell you that.  We're back.  Oh.  Eh.  All right, you're finished?  Is that it?  Well, we got to take a break. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know.  Take a break.  You tell us when you're finished.  I am the break.  Yes, you are.  Do you have any gigs coming up, Pat?  Are you doing any gigs at all?  You did quit.  I quit.  I don't lie to you.  I know.  No, I don't lie to you.  I don't feel anymore because it's enough.  I'm 85.  Your body doesn't do what you want.  Amazing.  My mind ain't what it used to be.  Really?  I can sit here for hours and be funny, but I don't know.  We'll get on a stage, and I got to go.  I hope I can remember this thing.  Well, you know, I made a few dollars.  It's over. 
[02:46:00]  It's fucking over, and it's tough to be over.  Then how about a good stage show would be Pat Cooper.  That's the world, yes.  And somebody else in chairs talking, and you could call it a discussion with Pat Cooper.  Oh, yeah.  And then you guys go back and forth and kind of get you on subjects to talk about because  it's still entertaining to hear you discuss something.  So the audience would be there knowing it's not a stand-up act.  It's a discussion.  No, I would do that, my buddy.  I would do that tomorrow.  But what I don't want to do is some routines and shit. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, you don't have to.  No, but I never did the same show twice.  I've told the same stories.  Of course I did.  But I've always injected something different because I was tired of saying the same.  If I sat on a chair and had an audience in front of me, and they told me to say the true  subject to subject, I think I could probably flow because I got a funny flow.  I think I could handle it.  I want to do it for the friars because I have a little hard-on for them.  And the minute they knew I had a hard-on for them, they took my picture off the wall. 
[02:47:00]  How do you call about that shit?  How do you call about that shit?  Pat Cooper's a black cloud.  They took my picture off the fucking wall.  A black cloud.  So here's what Steve said.  Just raved all around them every day.  Here's what Steve said.  What the fuck?  What Steve?  He said, if you're on Broadway or off-Broadway, as you walk out, you have a picture behind  you, and they take the picture off and walk off.  Because they proved to me that they don't respect dignity. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  And I'm going to get them comedically.  I'm not angry at them.  I hope the fucking train breaks down under the building, and I hope the fucking elevator  breaks down, that they're over there, because they're not...  And guess what?  Larry King is now the dean.  Yes, he is.  What?  Yes.  Yes, he's the dean of the friar.  This old fuck who has no fucking talent, who's a pest.  He's one of the United States pests.  How the fuck he lasted on CNN.  Let me tell you something.  Many years ago, I went to Washington when he had a show, 12 to 6. 
[02:48:00]  I was on six fucking hours.  Me.  He said, I never, never saw a guy could do six fucking hours.  He said, I'll never forget you.  I'm about maybe six, eight months.  I'm walking down some of the street.  Hey, how are you?  Huh?  Now they make him the fucking dean, who don't make shit to the friars, but the friars will  make anybody a fucking dean.  I mean, Jerry Lewis, I understand. 
[02:48:30]  Jerry's a great, great genius talent.  But what the fuck did he do to the friars?  I tell you.  All right, listen to me, my buddy.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  Stag, you're married eight years.  You're dead.  Everything about you is fucking dead.  Put the suspenders on your balls.  That's where you got to put them.  How fucking dare you?  And how fucking dare them name him as a dean?  Freddie Roman was a great dean.  Freddie, I hope you're well, and that's why you're not the dean anymore.  Now they need a Martin, so I'll have a Dean Martin. 
[02:49:00]  All right, yeah, there you go.  That would work.  Dean Martin would be the dean.  I ain't coming in no more, because you're getting on my fucking mind.  Yeah, I hear you.  Is this his last appearance, Steve?  Pat Cooper.  Yes.  Not as long as you want him.  Oh, no, your Pat's...  Pat comes back.  He'll come anytime you want.  Yeah.  All right, good.  Listen to me.  Don't say that.  You can't put your...  Don't say that.  Your F2A doesn't perform anymore.  Don't say that.  There you go.  Don't give me carte blanche.  I don't want carte blanche.  You don't have that.  I want you to call me.  I think this might be your last appearance.  The phone blew up.  Right, because we want you.  Of course we want you. 
[02:49:30]  But I don't want to force my greatness on you.  Because I say things for a fucking hour.  How many of your guests can hold you for a fucking hour?  That's true.  And your fucking friends, and you Stern fans, you're a disgrace.  Because you're college.  You don't want to hear two sides of a story.  We know what that makes you?  Animals.  Oh, wow.  Wow, well...  Animals.  How's your phone?  My phone is...  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to miss you.  I'm going to pass it.  Maybe Tim will bring him on.  Let him.  Yeah, all right.  But you've got a good idea.  Pat Cooper. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Let the record show that.  Bob Levy's been on hold the whole time.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  Go into that.  Yeah, have both of them.  Sure.  Bob, I don't know if we can handle this today, Bob.  Bob.  No, listen.  I just want to think about Pat.  Are we finished?  No, Focal.  He's one of the last great American heroes, okay?  Wow.  What time do you guys quit?  We quit a year ago.  You should have quit a year ago.  I beat you to the joke.  I beat you to the joke.  Thanks, Bob.  Let me tell you something, Pat.  I met you in there.  Hello.  They sent me in there to do a roast of me. 
[02:50:30]  Wait a minute.  Remember that stupid fucking bit they did?  And you told me.  Don't ever take a piece of paper.  Bob Levy.  I can't hear.  I can't hear.  Wait a minute.  Oh, you're turning that up?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  He's a comedian.  He's just saying that you're the last of the greats.  He's praising you.  Muscle tough.  That's Italian.  God bless you, Levy.  I got somebody, and I got my friend over here.  I got my friend.  I confuse you with North.  You are North.  Oliver North and Jim Norton.  It's fine.  North.  North.  N-O-T-H. 
[02:51:00]  That's the actor.  Great actor.  Oh, Chris Norton.  Oh, yeah.  No, that's fucking.  Hey, Levine.  I love you.  God bless him.  Thank you.  I got a winner.  I got somebody that cares.  He's trying to tell you something.  He's trying to tell you something.  Go ahead, Bob.  Let me tell you something.  You were so right about, Howard.  I quit his show to go on Opie and Anthony because it was the same bullshit over and over.  And he turned into fucking a cat woman all of a sudden.  Now he's got 100 cats all of a sudden, like a cunt he is.  And fucking him and Jared had me ban from the building saying I attacked security, these 
[02:51:30]  lying fucks, so I could not go on ONA and get in the building.  That's what kind of piece of shit they are.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to have a talking, too?  Thank you for having the balls to say it.  That's how the Nazis started.  Oh.  That's how the fucking Nazis started.  That's it.  That's how they fucking started.  This piece of shit.  Maybe we can rappel down the building.  Maybe we should be able to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Parachute.  You know, it's like.  Jesus-ass motherfuckers.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll see you next time.  Thank you, Bob.  Bob leaving.  Thank you, Bob Hitler.  I got a fan.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't wait to find out how that ends.  When you call Bob Levy a fucking asshole.  I got a fan.  Yeah, for 10 minutes.  Send me your picture.  All I want to say is we tried, but Pat Cooper's going to be Pat Cooper.  Boy, was that entertaining.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The ramblings of a madman, right?  Perspiring.  That's it, Pat.  I'm going to go give Pat Cooper a hug. 
[02:52:30]  Are you finished, you guys?  Yeah, we're going to be back now.  I got to take a piss.  No, but you're at 24 hours.  Once you go home, then we'll know the difference.  I like the way you think.  The great Pat Cooper.  Thank you.  All right.  In this fucking country.  I want to speak.  Don't let nobody.  Don't let nobody bullshit you that I can't talk about fucking Howard.  I'll stand by you until I fucking die because now this fucking Howard is a bully to have  people call up this studio while I'm on and not to talk to this cocksucker. 
[02:53:00]  He's a cocksucker to have you even saying that I can't talk in America, you fucking  hooah, you piece of shit.  You're disgraciada, fucking lowlife.  Disgraciada.  And you who's running the show, I'm coming after you, you fuck.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself interrupting my stardom, you cocksucker.  I'm telling you this.  You hurt my friend, Opie and Anthony.  This is fucking war.  Oh, shit.  I'll sit on your fucking lawn.  You tell that prick that you work for, he's a fucking piece of shit. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  Gee, thanks for telling him, Steve.  I guess Steve told him.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  No, he's not.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, Jesus.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I am so fucking mad.  This is how people, this is how people attack the fucking enemy.  You're worse than a terrorist, Howard. 
[02:54:00]  A terrorist.  You are a fucking terrorist.  Wow.  You're a disgrace.  I'm going to call up Netanyahu from Israel.  Oh.  And say, here's a fucking terrorist.  Piece of shit.  Fucking threatening my friends.  Disgracia.  Yeah.  Why don't you put a gun to my head and threaten me?  I'll die before I hang up that motherfucker.  Oh.  Howard, you're a piece of shit.  And there, uh.  Look at him.  There goes Pat.  Thanks for having us over the last night.  Yeah.  Take it in.  I'm a Nazi motherfucker.  Nazis.  Nice, Steve.  I'm so.  Nazis.  I really appreciate you told him that. 
[02:54:30]  Holy.  You're kind of keeping it vague, but.  Holy shit.  Well, is that it?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I am so turning my phone off today.  Wow.  Where were you at?  Well, I was saying Valentine.  Why not?  Why not be back?  I guess we got some spleening to do.  Why?  Look, man.  We were asked to, uh, you know, control Pat and make sure he doesn't trash Howard Stern.  Which, by the way, is literally impossible. 
[02:55:00]  No offense to the person who wrote this, although most know who wrote it.  I said, look, Pat Cooper's going to be Pat Cooper.  He's his own guy.  And at that point, what do you do?  You cancel his appearance?  Fuck no.  He's his own guy.  Because in the end, that was great radio.  That's all I give a fuck about on a daily basis.  That was hilarious.  Yeah.  And I understand the thinking behind, hey, we're trying to move things forward.  But the reality is, like, I'm not going to ever ask a guest.  I mean, I'll ask him not to make a fucking gun threat against a political figure.  Right.  But as far as that's concerned, I'm not going to ask a guest to not say anything because 
[02:55:30]  other shows aren't asked to ask guests to treat us better.  Oh, God, no.  Has any show ever said, hey, look, let's bury the hatchet with Opie and Anthony?  No, no.  It's been a one-way street for years.  That's just my issue.  Uh-oh.  Did I get crazy glue on the tip of your pen?  What?  Oh, is that what it is?  You creep.  Goodbye.  You're crazy gluing your teeth.  I was trying to write with it.  It was nothing.  Sorry, Jimmy.  There's a lot of cum in it, too.  So I guess you'd be digging that in your teeth. 
[02:56:00]  Crazy glue and jizz.  Look, here are the facts.  Howard Stern, there was a birthday party.  The company put a lot of time, effort, and money behind it, okay?  Yeah.  We were told that we will not be attending and we will not be getting the invite.  So that's kind of insulting right there.  If we did get the invite, I absolutely would not have gone, to be honest with you, because  we're just not on the same fucking page, obviously.  We've gone to all the other serious events.  Right.  And, you know, as an event, it was a complete, it was a huge success for the company. 
[02:56:30]  Who's that?  The dentist.  Who the fuck is that?  He's on the, he's fucking busy.  Stop fucking calling.  Hi, hi, hi.  What?  What?  He can't, he's busy shitting in someone's mouth.  Can he call you back?  He's trying to shit in my mouth.  Can he get back to you?  I'm on the air.  So that's like, everybody's going on.  Yeah, it's the shit in the mouth show.  I have, what time is my appointment, three? 
[02:57:00]  Exactly.  Okay.  Nice job on those fucking x-rays.  Teeth are falling out.  Like he has fucking cancer of the gums.  Yeah, tell her that the teeth have been falling out.  Yeah.  How temporary has it been cracking?  They're terrible.  I had to glue one in with crazy glue.  Yeah.  What are they, fucking chicklets with duct tape on them?  I did.  Horrible job.  Boo.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't suggest crazy gluing your teeth back into your mouth?  No.  All right.  Thank you, dear.  Boy, where do I go to get mine done?  Bye.  I just had to confirm my appointment.  I don't know if they didn't hear that.  It doesn't work because she's a fan of the show. 
[02:57:30]  We learned that last time.  Yeah, they know, so it doesn't even matter.  Yeah.  So, you know, as far as a broadcast in Atlanta, I heard it was a huge success.  I absolutely did not.  Your son's a big success.  I absolutely did not listen to a minute of it.  I had no fucking desire.  That's a fact, too.  Okay?  And Pat Cooper, you know, hates Howard just as much as I do, which is fucking terrific.  And, of course, he's going to come in here and fucking run away.  A lot of venom.  Right.  That is a lot of venom. 
[02:58:00]  So, those are the facts.  What are you going to do?  If it's a big company event, the company could have said, look, let's bury the hatchet between  the shows.  Would you guys be on your best behavior?  They didn't even ask.  It wasn't even considered.  The thing is, obviously, not bringing anyone up on stage.  Oh, God.  You know, that's crazy.  Right.  And, again, I absolutely, I wouldn't have gone, but the fact that we weren't even allowed  to speaks volumes.  Oh, no.  It was told to us that we'd make sure we stay away. 
[02:58:30]  But, you know, whatever.  That's what it's been.  That's what it's been for years and years.  I mean, I'm used to the segregation that goes on here between shows, and I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  But they get a little nervous when someone like Pat Cooper comes in, who had a relationship  with that show about years ago, was a huge part of it, and now speaks his mind.  Right.  Which goes back to my first point.  It was great radio.  And that's all we care about.  Oh, my God.  It was amazing.  Who's not listening to that shit?  Is there anyone that that motherfucker is still on any good terms with? 
[02:59:00]  Believe me, we'll be next.  Oh, yeah.  And those sons of bitches, O.P. Anthony, and that Jimmy.  That Chris Note that they have with him.  You're absolutely right.  That's how that shit works.  Oh, yeah.  You get excited, like, oh, fuck, he's on our side now, but that shit always bites you  in the ass.  And he's somebody that just, I don't think there's one person, professionally or personally,  that he hasn't completely fucking fallen out with. 
[02:59:30]  It's really, it's amazing to listen to.  I think his goal is to die with nobody liking him.  Well, the point was made, like, we're turning, I don't know.  It doesn't help our cause if Pat Cooper, you know, trashes Howard.  It's our cause.  As we try to advance our situation.  I don't know what any of this means, because we don't see any of this happening.  I don't know what it causes.  I mean, we're in a good place right now. 
[03:00:00]  I think the show and the channel is sounding better than ever.  We got a real true radio guy behind the channel now, so there's some very positive things  happening, but the company sees it how they see it, and there's nothing we can do to  change that.  They can't take away my dignity, because the greatest love of all, it ain't happening in  me.  There's hate.  You're a disgrace.  And we did okay, but then Steve, the tattletale, told Pat, after the appearance, what was 
[03:00:30]  going on behind the scenes.  And man, that, I've never seen anyone angrier.  That was Pat at 11.  Oh, yeah.  He was at 11.  How did those aged blood vessels not just rupture, as he's yelling like that, those  fucking, his veins and arteries must look like pretzel rods. 
[03:01:00]  They're just ready to just crackle.  That's 85.  Oh, my God.  They love him on Twitter.  They're fucking out of their minds loving Pat Cooper.  That's 85.  The energy that guy has, it's amazing.  And he looks damn fucking good.  And he's got plenty of time.  I don't believe that his brain's going, like he tries to say.  I don't believe it.  He can't really hear.  His hearing's shocked.  No, the hearing thing is a big issue with him.  But he even took time out of his Howard bashing to shit all over Dice, which I thought was  nice. 
[03:01:30]  He, you know, for him to take some of his hate for Howard and, you know, shovel it another  direction.  And spread it around a little bit.  Spread it around a little.  Pat doesn't go for the really dirty stuff, though, because he loved my Monster Rain special,  but he goes, that thing at the end with that big pussy.  You didn't need it.  You didn't need it.  And I wasn't mad at him.  I was like, well, that's just not his thing.  For him, that's ultra vulgar.  But to me, that's, you know.  Dignity.  Those guys would have talked about that in the 50s and 60s if they could have. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  That's what it is.  It's a different generation.  Yeah.  So I think that's, you know.  And obviously, we weren't going to, you know, stop Pat Cooper.  No.  Pat Cooper's going to say what Pat Cooper wants.  I think that was pretty obvious.  He's 85 fucking years old.  We're going to stop him and tell him he can't say anything he wants to.  He's earned the ability to say whatever the fuck he wants.  But no.  Don't worry, SiriusXM.  You had an amazing event.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  The event went great.  I think it's pretty obvious to everyone.  Everyone loves everybody.  Amazing event.  Okay.  It's a wonderful time.  It was very successful. 
[03:02:30]  Don't you worry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know it was amazing.  I wasn't there and I didn't fucking listen.  Period.  I just, I was reading people's tweets.  Yeah.  So there were people tweeting.  I know about it because of Jenny Hut and her neediness to get a celebrity picture.  Oh, that needy henna head.  That's about all I know about the damn thing.  Yes.  Yeah.  Because believe it or not, we don't sit around worrying about this shit.  Yeah.  We've carved out a nice little career for ourselves.  Did Tim go?  But it's not as good as his. 
[03:03:00]  Shut up.  Nobody was allowed to go that was concerned with the show.  No, no, no.  That's great.  That's a fact.  Travis?  No?  You didn't go?  No.  I'm telling you the guy's honest truth.  Travis wouldn't be invited to a thing done by this program.  Yeah.  Because he's fucking, he knows.  Yes, that's true.  He knows what I'm doing, what happens.  Were you invited to OB's Super Bowl party?  I didn't have a Super Bowl.  What?  Yeah, I just, I didn't go.  I went to yours.  I heard you had a big party.  There was pizza.  There was pizza and guests.  The game was on. 
[03:03:30]  I was there.  I didn't have a Super Bowl party.  Sam knows because he was there.  Oh my God.  I didn't ask.  I would have gone, but I already committed to go to yours.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  I do want to speak for myself.  Pat Cooper spoke a lot of truth today.  Boy, did he speak a lot of truth.  Well, he was there in the heyday.  That's me talking.  He knows.  Not the show.  Me, personally.  He was there.  I know for a fact there was a lot of truth in a lot of things that were said today. 
[03:04:00]  That guy's sharp.  Fuck.  All right.  He just unloads.  I have to plug.  Yes, Jimmy.  Yes.  I have great ticket sales.  Finally.  I'm very happy.  The Netflix is helping a lot.  Five straight sold out shows.  DC is totally sold out.  All shows.  Wow.  Nice.  Atlantic City is sold out, except for the late show on Saturday, which we just added.  And there are tickets available February 28th in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Music Hall, but  it's selling much better than I thought it was going to. 
[03:04:30]  So, late show at the Borgata on the 15th in Pittsburgh, and more dates being added soon.  Bravo.  All right.  Very cool.  I ain't taking any phone calls today.  Nah, fuck it.  Let's all just relax a day.  Let's all have a chew.  Let's all just relax for a day.  Howard will make his calls yelling and screaming like he always does.  Don't worry about it.  Everyone relax.  He'll make his yelling and screaming calls behind the scenes. 
[03:05:00]  We all know that.  Right.  I don't need a sweaty program director running and chasing me out of the building.  Jesus.  This is an issue.  We all know how this plays out.  Let him yell and scream.  Relax.  And then we'll sit down and discuss our side of it.  And hopefully we'll reconvene here tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Okay.  That sounds good to me.  And Jeremy now works with him, so.  Oh.  Remember the time Jeremy yelling and running down the fucking streets sweating. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, right.  Making us stop something that wasn't even going to happen.  Because someone was a bit paranoid.  A little panicky.  All right, y'all.  Yeah, yo.  See you later, y'all.  Label.  There you go.  Okay.  There you go.  You're welcome.  Here you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Bye.  Hayat?  Bye.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:06:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
