<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the Virginia Tech shooting, marked by the hosts' typical irreverent and often offensive banter before shifting to a more somber tone.  They harshly criticized President George W. Bush's response, contrasting it unfavorably with President Reagan's handling of the Challenger disaster, focusing on perceived emotional deficits in Bush's address.  Clips of both speeches were played and analyzed.  The discussion extended to criticisms of Virginia Tech's delayed response to the shootings and the media's coverage, deemed exploitative and sensationalistic by the hosts.  They highlighted the disparity between the extensive coverage of the Virginia Tech tragedy and the relatively swift fading of the Imus controversy. Listener calls included a Virginia Tech student's firsthand account, discussions about gun control and ownership, and complaints about the media’s focus on trivial news stories even amidst the tragedy.  Examples of these trivial stories included light-hearted segments on chocolate and an astronaut running a marathon in space.  The hosts also noted the irony of a news segment preempting a graphic image of a gun being fired with a "graphic content" warning.

The show then featured a call from Jenny, who described a sexual encounter involving her current and ex-boyfriends, leading to sexually suggestive jokes and encouragement from the hosts for her to repeat the prank call.  This was followed by a discussion of a *Daily News* photograph of an injured Virginia Tech student, focusing on humorous speculation (and vulgar language) about whether the student's genitals were blurred. A friend of the injured student called in to confirm his identity and provide a condition update, providing graphic details of the injuries.  The hosts further criticized a CW11 news segment featuring a lighthearted belly dancing report, juxtaposed with the Virginia Tech tragedy, using offensive language to express their disapproval.

The broadcast continued with more listener calls reacting to Jenny’s prank call and the Virginia Tech shooting, interspersed with discussions about Richard Gere's controversy in India (and the absurdity of the resulting effigy burning), and excerpts from the Virginia Tech press conference, punctuated by the hosts' crude and offensive commentary. A listener criticized their approach to the news coverage, leading to further discussion about their style and relationship with the media.  Another caller detailed their experiences moving to Brazil, focusing on the prevalent prostitution and contrasting the ease of accessing sex work there with dating difficulties in the United States.

The show's main event was the in-studio appearance of Mikey, a chimpanzee, with his handlers Judy and Greg, along with Jimmy Norton.  Mikey engaged in various antics including interacting with the hosts and Norton (showing a preference for Jimmy), peeling a Band-Aid from Opie's hand to put on Steve's, playing with poker chips, and generally causing a ruckus in the studio.  His handlers discussed Mikey's intelligence, strength, and the challenges of managing his behavior, referencing a previous "awful" MTV pilot with Jimmy Norton and a dispute with Poker Share over unpaid funds and unauthorized image use from a poker event. The hosts frequently punctuated the segment with crude jokes relating to Mikey's behavior, including references to defecation and his immense strength.  The segment also included discussions of a sick co-host, a "line of the day" contest, a stand-up comedy show promotion, and mentions of photos and videos taken during Mikey's visit.  The segment ended with further amusing and bizarre interactions between Mikey and the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM 202, featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Before you get pissed off at us, man, we have nothing to do with this.  What? What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore. It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police. 
[00:00:30]  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize. I probably can't apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Hi.  This thing on.  Here we go.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A very sad day.  Oh, a very somber day.  Watch the news.  Oh, my God.  Did you just, like, watch all the news coverage of the shooting?  All day long. 
[00:02:30]  All day long.  That's all I did.  I got a really heavy cold, so after yesterday's show, just laid on the couch for, oh, about  12 straight hours.  Yeah.  And there was some fine TV to watch yesterday.  Watching the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  That kid's cell phone coverage of the shooting?  Yeah.  Yep.  Saw that about 800 times.  The police guy answering no questions.  The president of Virginia Tech.  Kind of clueless. 
[00:03:00]  A little clueless.  No one really, um, no one really had any answers.  Except President Bush.  Did he piss you off?  You know, he's got a way about him when tragedy strikes this country of just getting up there  and pulling everyone together with his, um, profound, heartfelt speeches.  I was screaming at the TV after he talked, you know, because they kept promoting, uh, the  president will have a statement on the Virginia Tech, uh, shooting at 4.07, 4.10, whatever. 
[00:03:30]  I like before that, how they go, um, and we're, we're getting a news in that the president  has been informed of this.  He has been informed.  Really?  I've been informed of it for about five hours now with all the news coverage.  You mean Bush was just told?  What happened?  I wasn't watching, uh, the TV.  He's probably playing, like, badminton or something.  And then they had to, like, run onto the badminton court to inform him.  Trying to find a new war czar. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I didn't know what happened.  But he, uh, he had his statement.  And I just, uh, I wrote just a nasty email.  Get me his statement for tomorrow's show.  And Anthony brought up a good point in the office.  Remember President Reagan?  Reagan.  He was a great actor, so he, like, had that crap down, you know?  Not a great actor, but at least he was an actor.  And, uh, when the challenger, uh, blew up.  And when he got on and gave his speech about how the, uh, the, uh, crew, uh, touched the face of God. 
[00:04:30]  And he had a bunch of really, like...  Amazing.  Yeah, good stuff.  Had, like, his eyes welled up a little bit.  Yeah, just enough.  Oh, just enough.  Where it didn't look weak, but it looked like, wow, he's got, you know, he's feeling for this whole situation.  He wasn't going to bawl in front of America, but he understood that you'd need to show just a little bit of emotion.  And it came off as heartfelt, whether it was or not.  We should get that speech today, just to compare. 
[00:05:00]  Because President Bush, he was just a robot.  Slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.  God.  Well, what, Nancy Hosh.  Didn't he...  Almost cursed.  Did he walk off, uh, the podium and then start hugging the family members and all that?  Yeah, he just knew how to do it.  He just knew how to, like, comfort the nation.  Bush is reading this statement that he has to keep looking down at.  Like if you...  Like if he said, like a robot.  I don't, I don't get it, man. 
[00:05:30]  You know, if you're the president of the United States of America, and you can't go on live TV and just talk from your heart without a statement?  Just wing it.  Who gives a crap you mess up a word or two?  Just get up there and talk to the country.  Instead, they, the reason they, they said he'll be talking at 415, he had his writers and his people trying to get the perfect statement.  Yeah.  The right words and words that will tug you a certain way.  But won't be too controversial in some way, shape, or form, and this, and that.  It's just, uh, that's what we become. 
[00:06:00]  It's unbelievable.  I need this down.  Well, they called Reagan the great communicator, I think, which was his nickname.  Yeah.  He had a knack for talking.  He got stuff through Congress that were a lot of Democrats.  He was just a great speaker.  Yeah.  Well, here's his statement in case you missed it.  I was just, like, riveted.  I was like, well, thank God we're in good hands.  And picture, he was just looking down at a paper and looking up and looking back down at his paper.  So just, like, insincere.  Please tell me he doesn't say anything about it.  I did not see the speech. 
[00:06:30]  I got an email from you last night.  I said, I'm not going to watch it.  I want to hear it.  Mm-hmm.  Did he say anything about resolve?  Uh, I don't know.  Well.  Resolve.  It was just, it was just babble.  It was just like a robot up there.  The laundry detergent?  Why would he?  No, but you have to show our result.  You know, just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, here it is.  Here's the perfectly, uh, the perfect statement from President Bush.  All right.  Our nation is shocked and saddened by the news of the shootings at Virginia Tech today. 
[00:07:00]  The exact toll has not yet been confirmed, but it appears that more than 30 people were killed  and many more were wounded.  I've spoken with Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech and many across our nation are praying  for the victims and their families and all the members of the university community who  have been devastated by this terrible tragedy.  It's terrible tragedy. 
[00:07:30]  Any time someone says, I'll pray for you in your family, no, you won't.  Yeah.  You never do, you just say, it's a thing you say.  Could you see Bush there on his knees in his little, in his little pajamas with that  little hat on?  His little pajama pointy hat with the pom-pom on the end?  His little night caps in there at the edge of his bed?  And dear God, I won't pray for the victims at Virginia Tech.  I told them that my administration would do everything possible to assist with the investigation 
[00:08:00]  and that I pledged that we would stand ready to help local law enforcement and the local  community in any way we can during this time of sorrow.  School should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning.  On a limb.  When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every  American community. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  This statement isn't as bad.  Is this the original one?  This might have been like the second one he did or something.  It's still just not, it's using all the catchphrases that you want to use and all the things.  Like, of course, I'm going to open up my administration and law enforcement to any help you need.  Like, he's going to say, you know, like, like they're going to say, you know, we could  really use kind of an FBI team down here because they got their resources.  No, no, they're busy. 
[00:09:00]  You know, of course they're going to have resources.  We got Jim from Philly.  What the F is he supposed to say, you douchebags?  No, but he's supposed to.  I don't know.  Maybe show some kind of like human emotion.  Why you got to make fun of Bush.  Here we go.  We're just attacking.  Jeez, I really didn't want to.  And look, we defended Bush very often here, but it's just a bad.  It might offend somebody like I am.  Hey, Val.  It might be over.  Hey, Val.  Val.  Yeah.  Who are you talking to?  Yeah, you weren't talking to us, so start over.  We just put you on the air. 
[00:09:30]  We let you talk, so don't worry.  I don't know how you guys got a bag on Bush like that.  He's got to be careful with what he says now.  Nowadays, it seems in this country that it won't take the war in Iraq going to hell to get Bush fired.  But it might be something wrong.  You can't get really fired from the presidency.  Yeah, dude.  You're not going to get fired.  Yeah, it's pretty tough.  They threaten impeachment all the time, but it never really happens.  Clinton was impeached.  Yeah, he's fine.  But he was able to keep his job.  That's what I mean.  It never really goes to the end.  You know what it is, sir?  It's a hacky political speech. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And there are times where you expect that, but from Bush, you've kind of gotten a lot  of the same speeches, like, I'm right already.  We get it.  We're saying the right things, quote unquote.  And this is a speech his father could have made, like, years ago.  But I think as a society, we're much more media savvy, and we just need a little more from  the president of the United States.  Like, genuine emotion.  Yeah, this horse crap doesn't work anymore.  It might have before the internet and blogs and video phones and all that, but we're way 
[00:10:30]  more in touch these days.  And you want someone to get up there and just speak from the heart without a paper in front  of us.  Just fake empathy.  Saying all the catchphrases that you expect from him.  Well, I understand that.  But really, after about, what, almost eight years of this, you really expect anything better  from Bush.  Just let him ride it out and get the hell out.  You know, there was a time where I liked Bush a lot, like, as far as emotion is concerned.  I thought he showed, like, after 9-11, I thought he was very human, and I liked the way he  had himself that.  I thought he was great. 
[00:11:00]  When he was with the emergency workers down at Ground Zero, that was like a moment where  it wasn't written.  He kind of gave this off-the-cuff speech to the guys.  That was kind of cool.  But now everything's just written down and make sure you say the right thing.  Then again, with the president, maybe I'll play devil's advocate here.  When you're talking, and you know, especially in the, like, hopes of the day, the blogs and  the internet, everything you say within 30 seconds is everywhere in the world. 
[00:11:30]  Him.  Maybe it does put an added pressure, like, that you cannot have a misstep, or it's everywhere  in the world immediately.  That's true.  I think you've got to take a chance, man.  You know, you expect to hear something that might comfort you just a little bit from the  president, and this is just, this is horse crap.  It really is.  It means nothing.  Brian in Tennessee, what's up?  Morning, fellas.  Hey.  Hey.  I don't buy it.  I think O.B.'s absolutely right.  He's pausing in his speech exactly where he pauses in every speech he gives. 
[00:12:00]  He gives, he says four or five words and stops.  Four or five words and stops, and that's it.  Either he can't talk any other way because he's too dumb, or, like you said, it was pre-written  for him, and he just can't do it.  I guess there was a time our president, you know, you really looked up to him, and they  had the right thing to say, and they had human emotions.  I guess that's long gone, and maybe I'm expecting too much from him, because it's not  even, it's not even a personal attack, to be honest with you.  The next guy's going to have the same type of statement, and the same bullcrap, you 
[00:12:30]  know, speech to the nation.  You know, you want someone to just get up there and talk to you.  Like, you feel like he's talking right to you as a human being.  Exactly.  And you just don't get that from any real political, any political leaders anymore.  The old fireside chat.  Right.  Right, sure.  That's what I want.  You just don't get it.  They can't do that anymore, because they'll get hung out to dry, because they're politically  incorrect, or they'll offend somebody. 
[00:13:00]  Right, right.  But go National Predators.  We'll see you guys later.  Right.  Today, our nation agrees with those who have lost loved ones at Virginia Tech.  We hold the victims in our hearts.  We lift them up in our prayers, and we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering  today.  Loving.  Thank you.  What?  What does that mean?  That's like, you could put a rap beat behind that, and you've got a hit song. 
[00:13:30]  It almost rhymed.  It was almost a poem.  Loving God.  I don't know.  We just showed the Hulk movie, and no, no, but they said who was going to be the new  Hulk, and it looks like your buddy there from Fight Club, Edward Norton.  Oh, cool.  Well, that's what they just showed.  I'm sure if we talked to him on the phone, he wouldn't have any clue about it.  There's one story here. 
[00:14:00]  This guy, this kid who got shot in the arm, and he said that the guy walked in and started  popping people.  Everyone in the front row got in the head, and he shot a lot of people, and walked out,  and there's a few people that weren't shot, and this guy was smart because he barricaded  the door with his foot.  He, you know, weds his foot.  Yeah.  And the guy came back.  Yeah, tried to open the door again.  He started, like, just firing shots through the door.  He tried to get back in.  Yeah.  Yeah, they interviewed that guy on the news last night, saying he's kind of a, you know,  a hero.  He saved a few people's lives.  They did not handle this. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, two hours.  How do you do that?  Yeah, that's the big thing.  First, you get the shooting in the dorm, and that seemed to be, the police said, a domestic.  They thought it was, you know, a boyfriend-girlfriend situation.  The girlfriend and RA were shot and killed at that point.  And everyone knows it's a Chinese national by now, right?  Yeah.  Here on a student visa, and I guess he had some kind of girlfriend.  Yeah.  And she was seeing some other guy, and he went into the dorm. 
[00:15:00]  This is the, it's still, like, kind of, we're only getting pieces of the whole thing.  But then he, like the aunt says, he shoots the girlfriend and the RA, right?  Yeah.  In the dorm room.  Yep.  Was she seeing someone else, or did he just think she was?  Well, they don't know.  We don't know.  I mean, that's basically what's out today, this morning.  And then he disappears, and the cops show up and start an investigation, but there isn't  any word to the students, no lockdown, no nothing. 
[00:15:30]  That's kind of an odd thing when the shooter isn't there.  Two people are dead on a college campus.  They don't have the shooter, and you don't kind of alert the staff.  Did you hear what the excuse was?  There's so many people, and it's a big community.  No, no, no.  A lot of buildings, a lot of people already going to classes.  I heard three different excuses.  I heard the other excuse, too, was they thought the guy not only left the campus, left the  state.  Yeah.  That's assuming way too much right there. 
[00:16:00]  It's a huge school.  Something like 23,000 or so students and faculty, over 100 buildings.  So it's like a town.  That was kind of their excuse, too.  It's like not just a small school.  This would be shutting down like a small town.  So they had the police there investigating that shooting.  But then two hours go by, and this guy, if it is the same guy, which, you know, that's  almost 100%, but they're not saying it is. 
[00:16:30]  He pops up at the other end of the campus.  He walked.  Yeah, remember.  He walked across campus.  This huge campus.  Two hours later.  It wasn't dorm and, you know, building right next door.  He walked pretty much through campus.  To the engineering, an engineering class.  Yep, classroom.  Without shooting anybody on the way.  So there were people that passed this guy, saw him.  Someone probably bumped into him.  You know how it is when you're walking.  Yeah.  I had no idea that this guy was strapped and shooting people.  Ready to go.  And then that happened. 
[00:17:00]  So they're taking a lot of criticism right now as to why they didn't take the first shooting  a lot more seriously and take the people's safety in consideration by, you know, at least  alerting them that, hey, there's a shooting.  We don't know where this gunman is.  Uh, you might want to be careful.  They probably should have handled it better.  But you got to say, like, almost in defense of them, most times when a shooting happens,  you don't think the gunman's going to go to lunch and come back two hours later.  You just got the hell out of there and took off.  School shootings are different, though. 
[00:17:30]  They've always been different and handled different.  When you get a school shooting, it's usually lockdown, make sure everyone's okay, kind of a thing.  This one, though, seemed to be like it was a shooting just in a town.  You know, no one knew about it.  It's one of those things, oh, what's happened over there?  Oh, there was a shooting.  It's on a school campus.  You'd think they would really kind of take more time and warn the students, maybe even  lock everyone down until they check the entire campus. 
[00:18:00]  It's big, but, I mean, Jesus.  Have they confirmed it's one shooter?  They haven't even really confirmed that it's one shooter, but they're just assuming at this  point it is.  Last night I heard...  One of the possibilities is that it's two different incidents.  Yeah.  And one of those just crazy coincidences.  Last night from the police spokesman they had on, he said that they have a person of  interest in the first shooting, and it's unrelated to the second shooting, which is odd.  But then I heard this morning that they think more that it's the same guy that did the first 
[00:18:30]  one and the second one.  It's like, what's this person of interest thing?  That's all I heard, though.  He came back three times to that classroom.  Yeah.  Three times.  He wanted in.  And what was he looking for?  The boyfriend?  I don't know.  More people to kill.  There's still a lot of confusion here.  If it's two shooters, then we still don't know the motive of the Chinese...  That might be it, too.  You know what?  That's a good point.  Maybe the boyfriend or the guy that he thought she was banging or whatever was a student, 
[00:19:00]  an engineering guy, whatever, who was in that building.  Yeah, he went to the dorm, found her, but didn't find him.  I don't know.  There's a lot of questions still that'll be answered, I'm sure, today.  You need to start shooting everyone like that?  How angry...  Like, I've been mad at women, and I've been depressed at relationships, but how...  I don't understand how you start with just picking off other people.  I don't get it.  And there's anger.  And there's, you know, a bit of premeditation there.  I mean, the guy obviously was loaded up, ready to go, had chains and locks. 
[00:19:30]  He locked up the doors from the inside, so the cops had to get bolt cutters to open up  the doors, and the kids couldn't get out.  They would jump out of third-story windows.  Like, a lot of the injuries that are being treated in the hospital, people with broken  legs and broken arms from jumping out the window.  So, and, yeah, locked the place up.  He had a lot of time in there.  That's why so many people were killed. 
[00:20:00]  Amazing.  All right, we're going to take a break.  It's going to be a different Opie and Anthony show once again today, and that's just fine  with us.  We'll go to the phones.  They're lit from all over the country.  We'll talk to you guys and see what's going on.  See what you're thinking here today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:30]  Opie and Anthony!  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  They heard that?  Yeah.  I said, that'll get us screwed.  Idiots.  I'm not going to read certain jokes that are being made today.  Idiots are already telling jokes on the instant feedback.  Try to keep our job at some point.  What can I tell you?  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's go right to the phones.  People calling from all over the country.  We got Matt in Virginia.  Matt, you went to Virginia Tech? 
[00:21:00]  I still do.  You still do?  So what's going on?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  We woke up yesterday and I wasn't going on to campus until about 10.  Then we got that email.  We got the first one about 9.30ish.  By the way, they did send out an email.  Two hours late, yeah.  Was it two hours late?  Yeah.  It was at 9.26, I think, was the official.  Right before the shooting started, they sent out an email.  What was the first?  And the email just said, you know, be cautious, look for suspicious.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, like the first one, it was saying, you know, there's like a shooting that's in one 
[00:21:30]  of the dorms on campus.  But, I mean, that was pretty much it.  It gave like some phone numbers and saying, you know, if you've seen anything suspicious,  report it to the police.  Now, does anyone know when the first shooting occurred?  Seven-something, right?  Seven-15.  So, man, most of the students were home.  When does first class start?  Classes start about eight.  Buses start running.  Holy cow, man.  Why do they just say, like, stay home until further information? 
[00:22:00]  Well, I can kind of understand.  I mean, you were saying, like, it's a small town.  You know, like, shutting down a small town.  That is a lot of...  But any type of shooting on a campus, you just got to tell everyone, stay home until  we figure this out.  I'm sorry, man.  And I think that's an obvious one.  That's not playing, you know, Monday morning quarterback or whatever.  Yeah.  That just seems pretty obvious.  There's going to be a lot of, you know, people going back and saying, well, why didn't  they do that?  Oh, yeah.  They're already calling for the president of the university to be fired. 
[00:22:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like you saw them on TV.  I mean, they look beat.  I mean, this is like the...  Oh, yeah.  ...the police said it's like the worst thing he's ever seen.  Well, it's the worst thing just about all of us have ever seen except for, of course,  the 9-11 stuff.  But as far as, you know, shootings go, this is the worst in U.S. history.  Why fired?  Should he be fired, though?  I mean, I don't know how many he should be.  Absolutely he should be fired.  There was a shooting on campus, and he didn't do enough.  Yeah, they're saying that the campus police didn't do a good job.  They're really pointing fingers now, so...  You can't keep your job after 32 people are dead. 
[00:23:00]  You just can't.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  I mean, you know, I don't want to make any type of comparison, but you got I.M.  saying some dumb thing on the radio.  He lost his job.  So I would assume the president of this, you know, college has got to go.  When you have the first shooting where two people were dead and you don't kind of lock  down or make sure that they didn't know where the shooter was.  If it was a murder-suicide, let's say, that's one thing.  But, you know, you got to sort that out.  When you got a dead girl and then the dead RA and it doesn't seem to be suicide, there's 
[00:23:30]  no gun laying around, you know, perhaps you got to say, hey, there's a gunman that's loose.  We don't know exactly where he is.  We think he might be off campus, but we can't be sure.  Or maybe you should, you know, lock it down at that point and make sure you know where  this gunman is or make sure you know he's not on campus and then go back to business  as usual.  But someone dropped the ball here. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, Matt, were you on campus at all during the whole thing or?  Well, I was actually getting ready to go on campus and catch like the 10 o'clock bus on  and we got, like I said, that first email, like it was, you know, formatted right, like  punctuation, everything, phone numbers and stuff.  And then the second one came out at 9.55 and it was like somebody just, you know, sent up  an instant message.  Like it was just written up, you know, stay where you are, keep away from the window.  So that kind of scared me to death.  Me and one of my roommates, I was on campus.  Me and one of them were still here in the apartment.  The other two were on campus. 
[00:24:30]  So we called both them real quick to make sure they were all right.  And, you know, sit down, turned on the news and shut all the windows, got air weaponry  out and kind of sit in the living room, locked up and stuff, just kind of hanging out and  wait and see what happened.  And so we were just watching the news all morning.  And when we heard, you know, it started out just one shooting in the dorms.  There was one person dead.  And they started saying, you know, like six people injured.  Then it went up to nine.  And then out of nowhere, it seemed like it jumped up to 20. 
[00:25:00]  And we were just like, what is going on?  And so that's when all the phone calls from my family and friends and everything started  coming in.  And so we talked to my roommate.  Nobody I knew was, well, nobody that I knew at that time was in Norris.  Like I talked to all my friends I could on like AOL and call them and stuff.  But cell phones were hard to get through.  So we were just, you know, talking to everybody that we could.  One of my roommates made it home.  The other one, he was in one of the buildings that they were taking. 
[00:25:30]  The kids actually jumped out of the windows, too.  Yeah.  And so he was helping out with like the EMTs and stuff there, just like with the broken  ankles, broken ribs and stuff.  So we finally got a hold of him.  So we were, you know, glad he was safe and everything.  And so, I mean, all we could do really just sit and watch the news.  And I mean, the media kind of made me mad the way that they were just getting the kids  are still in shock and trying to, you know, to.  Yeah.  All they could do is grab up as many of these kids as possible. 
[00:26:00]  And then they're commenting on like, I'm amazed at how calm a lot of these kids are.  They're in shock.  They're in complete states of shock.  And they're grabbing them for interviews.  They couldn't fly Geraldo down there quickly enough.  And Shep, Shepard Smith, they got him down there.  And they're interviewing these kids.  They're dragging them in front of cameras, having them talk about how their friends were  shot, having them talk about. 
[00:26:30]  They had one girl that Geraldo brought up and he's asking her, do you know anybody that's  missing?  And of course he does.  He knows that what the answer is.  And she said, yes, we've been calling.  And he hasn't called his parents.  We haven't been able to get him on the cell phone.  We've checked the hospitals.  We can't find them.  Well, it's looking a lot like he's one of the 30 that are up in that classroom that are  dead.  And Geraldo's just like questioning her and maybe just leave the girl alone at this moment. 
[00:27:00]  The media, their whole job in a situation like this is to get down to that campus immediately.  Oh, yeah.  Get students on the air and make sure they cry.  That's the only thing they're going for.  And that's what they were doing.  That's pretty harsh, I understand.  But that is their job.  They don't care about these people as individuals.  They have a job to do, and their job is to get someone on camera that is shedding some  tears.  That's their whole job.  Because the second they start choking up a little or their eyes start welling up, they'll 
[00:27:30]  ask more questions, deeper and more personal.  They know they're almost there.  Like, oh, this must just be such a tragic event, knowing that so many who may be your  friends are dead.  Right when they see them welling up, they ask them things like that.  It's like, yeah, well, obviously.  But they just want that emotional, like, the emotional money shot.  Yeah.  They're vultures, the press.  Vultures.  Absolutely.  Matt, anything else to add? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  So, I mean, we were all just kind of in a, say, disbelief, you know, in shock.  And I hadn't been on campus all day, so this was still something that seemed like it  happened pretty far away from me.  And then last night, probably around 9, we got some news about, like, my roommate from  freshman year was one of the 30 people.  And that just kind of made it really hit home a whole lot harder.  And I don't know, just it's really good to see everybody coming together.  Like, there's a ceremony today at 2, and everybody I've talked to, even if they don't know somebody 
[00:28:30]  that it has directly affected.  You know, I mean, even though we're 26,000, we're still a pretty close community.  And it's just going to be good, I guess, to get together and see everybody and know that  everybody still is proud to be a Hokie and that we can still come together after something  like this.  Yeah, you guys are going to have some kind of big memorial service, I'm sure.  And I can't wait to see what politicians try to weasel their faces in on that one.  Yeah, that's what I'm kind of waiting for.  Yeah, because now it's like, now it's not, you know, getting together with the Rutgers 
[00:29:00]  basketball team.  Now it's going to be every politician rushing down there to be seen at a photo op, consoling  one of you guys.  It's so annoying, man.  This puts everything in perspective.  Who's looking at the Rutgers women's basketball team as victims?  Yeah, exactly.  Go away.  Scarred for life, really?  Are you?  How about some of the kids that were at Virginia Tech?  That, to me, is scarred for life. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Not, you know, being called a bad word.  By an aging shock jock.  Yeah.  Thank you, Matt.  That's about it?  That's all I got.  We just want you guys to talk today, so...  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Matt.  You know what you do?  You grab yourself some Jaeger and a few beers.  Yeah, yeah, that's kind of what we were doing until...  Maybe a doobie.  Awful news and that kind of thing.  Maybe a smoke a little doob.  All right, Matt.  There's Matt from Virginia.  Let's say hi to Mike in Buffalo.  Mike, what's up? 
[00:30:00]  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  I go to UB here, and, like, I was going to say, it's kind of tough to lock down a whole  school.  We had, like, an incident last semester with a rapist on our bike path, and we got, like,  a sign on the door that says, like, oh, just be careful.  Yeah, heads up.  Heads up.  There's a rapist loose.  Rapist loose.  Yeah.  That's bad.  But, I mean, a rapist and a guy who's actively shooting people are kind of...  Yeah, it was brought up on the news last night.  In this day and age, you know, every kid has a cell phone for the most part, and they're 
[00:30:30]  all on them constantly.  Yeah.  There's got to be a better system.  It's easy to say that now, but maybe some changes will happen because of this.  Who knows?  This is an interesting part of the story I was listening to last night was the Internet  being used more so than any other time during tragedies like this.  Actually, the students themselves helped each other out.  Yeah.  That actually really helped the situation.  There was a big exchange of information on the Internet.  They would just be locked down in their dorm rooms or wherever they were, and obviously access 
[00:31:00]  to computers, and just, you know, going back and forth, looking for info, going to the  news sites, and then trading information with each other like that.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jack in Los Angeles.  Jack, what's up?  Here, Jack.  Hi.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hate you.  Hate the show.  Thank you.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  Well, the good thing is this is going to take the focus off of Imus.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  A lot of people are saying, you know, if this happened last week, Imus still has a job.  That is the truth in how the media and media frenzies work.  Imus messed up on a very slow news week.  If this was last week, I mean, not that it matters in the overall scheme of things, but  Imus definitely would still have a job.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the way it is.  The point is that, like, where there's a bigger body, that's where the vultures go  to.  Right.  And if they didn't feel they could feed on Imus, they would have flown to this and fed  here.  Oh, they would have flown off the Imus controversy like that. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Speaking of what Stephen asked from Bayshore, this is the kind of story that deserves full  national and international media attention.  Right.  Not a non-issue like the Imus story.  I say to all those brave people that were all over the news last week, why don't you take  on this issue?  Yeah.  Why don't you take on this very controversial issue?  Guns in America.  Good luck.  Have fun with that one.  Have fun.  Take on a real issue.  Let's see how brave you really are.  Why don't you get on Meet the Press and all the news programs and discuss this one? 
[00:32:30]  Well, I think that's what you're going to see.  Yeah.  You're going to see a lot of that.  We'll see.  There won't be any real name politicians going after anything like that.  They'll go after video games.  Well, I think you'll have more Democrats probably.  Well, you can't go up to guns on this one, but it's hard to defend guns on this one.  I don't care how you do it.  It's kind of tough.  It's easy to defend gun laws.  That's what it's all about. 
[00:33:00]  I don't think a Chinese national that is in this country on a student visa is allowed to purchase a gun.  So the second he got his hands on the guns, they were illegal weapons.  Illegal weapons.  I'm against illegal guns.  Believe me.  I think any legal gun owner is against illegal guns.  And most crime is committed.  You don't buy a gun, register it, go through the waiting period, sit there, especially in a state like New York where it's six months at least before you can get a pistol license. 
[00:33:30]  You don't go through all that and then shoot a bunch of people and commit crimes with a registered handgun in your name.  So illegal guns.  Yes, let's do whatever we can to get illegal guns out of people's hands that will do things like this.  Because legal guns help situations.  Wasn't it an illegal gun?  Of course it was.  The guy is a Chinese national.  He's not allowed to have a gun. 
[00:34:00]  I'm just asking because it made the news yesterday that Virginia is one of the easiest states to get a gun in.  It is.  If you're an American citizen, you have proper ID, there are channels you go through.  They're saying it's an easy state to get guns in.  So they're saying people buy the guns and then they drive them up to places like New York.  Immediately becomes an illegal gun when you cross the state line.  It's easy to get in Virginia.  Okay.  Again, how many legal guns are being used even if bought in a state where it's easy to get a gun? 
[00:34:30]  Legal gun, you buy it, is being used in crimes.  It's not happening like that.  These are illegal weapons being used by people that are crazy.  The only thing is a legal weapon would have been used in something like this too because when you snap, you're not thinking of the legality or the traceability.  When you snap over a relationship and you're killing people and you know you're going to kill yourself.  I'm not saying it never happens.  If you have a legal gun in the house, you walk in and see your wife having sex with somebody and you start rattling off some rounds. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, legal gun was used.  I'm sure that's happened.  Absolutely.  Positive.  But in these cases, you don't hear politicians and everyone coming to take away your Second Amendment right over cases like that.  It's always these or guns in New York is a big thing like get the guns off the street.  There's too many guns.  There's this, that, the other.  How many gangs are going in and registering their handguns and illegal modified weapons to use in crimes? 
[00:35:30]  It's not happening.  Now, and this argument comes up a lot too.  Obviously, it's a college campus.  So whether you're allowed to carry on college campuses, you're allowed in Utah.  You're allowed, if you're on a college campus, to carry a gun.  That's a whole other issue.  On a school ground, it gets a little iffy.  But if somebody had a registered gun for their own protection and a concealed weapons license in that situation, you know, you shoot the guy. 
[00:36:00]  You know, if a couple of people had registered handguns for protection, this wouldn't have happened.  If you look at, here's why I disagree with that.  Okay.  You're right.  You are right.  But if you look at the amount of college students in this country and the amount of college shootings, you know, you can't say high school because they probably would never allow this.  No, no.  The statistics are probably very low.  I mean, extraordinarily low.  Yeah, it is. 
[00:36:30]  So, but if you had it legal for all those students or as many as possible to illegally carry guns, I think that you find a lot more in just rage incidents, jealousy incidents, or things that break out in fights or have violent interactions would end that way.  I think you have a lot higher number because, you know what I mean, like –  Maybe, but we'll never know that because they'll never allow people to do that.  It's one of those situations where – and it's not like just start handing out guns to people. 
[00:37:00]  I'm not saying that either.  Like, hey, you're registered for our school.  Here's your gun.  It's – you want to have a better screening process.  I'm for that.  I'm for, like, you know, people have to go through – I think you should go through safety courses and know exactly what they're doing with a gun before they're able to have it.  That's fine.  You know, put those things in place.  But it's – what this does is make it harder for people that want to legally own guns. 
[00:37:30]  And then – and this debate's been going on for years.  And there's more and more gun control every year.  There's more and more gun control.  It doesn't stop this.  How hard was it for you to get your guns?  I have rifles, so it's not that difficult.  But for a handgun, it's taking months.  It takes at least six months in Nassau County, New York, in Suffolk County.  In the city?  Forget about it. 
[00:38:00]  You think you're legally owning a pistol in New York City.  You better be squeaky clean.  And even then, you know, you might screw up something on the application.  It just – it takes forever.  And these are people that legally want to own handguns for their own protection.  Well, this is not allowed to.  Obviously, this is going to be argued both ways for the next week or so.  Let's say hi to Mike from Pearl River.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Mike.  Hey, I'm with you.  I'm one of these quote-unquote legal gun owners in New York. 
[00:38:30]  It took me six months to get it.  I have a permit to carry.  And it took me six months to get it after fingerprints in the background.  Yep.  And then if you wanted to go get another pistol in New York, you'd go buy one, but then you've got to go back and get another permit.  It takes two weeks.  You've got to get – yeah, for every gun you buy, you have to go to a precinct and fill out paperwork, take it back to the gun store where they validate it or do something, take it back to the precinct, back to the gun store, and then you finally get your gun. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  If I want to take – let's say I have a pistol.  I'm in Nassau County, and I want to go upstate New York.  Before I enter New York City limits, I have to unload it, put it in a locked box in my trunk, and not stop in New York City limits.  So it can't be stolen.  So it can't – not so it can't be stolen because I'm not allowed to carry it.  It's not – it has nothing to do with being stolen.  It's so – because I don't have a permit to have a gun in New York City limits. 
[00:39:30]  If you get pulled over, would you get in trouble for that?  No.  No.  It's illegally on gun, but I would have to tell them where I'm going, maybe even prove where I'm going, that I'm not going into New York City and staying there.  I can't stop at a friend's house.  I can't stop to get something to eat or drink in New York City.  I have to keep driving until I exit New York City limits on the north side, and then I could again take it, load it, and conceal.  But you're allowed to – like I'm saying, you're allowed to – if you put it in the trunk, you're allowed to drive through New York City with it, but you can't stop. 
[00:40:00]  Cannot stop, which would be great in New York City.  Could you imagine getting carjacked and going, excuse me, can I get in my trunk for a minute and unlock my box, load my gun so I could maybe have a chance here at surviving this?  Amazing.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Really fast.  Let's go to Nick in Jersey.  Nick, what's going on?  Believe me, that law I just told you is not helping us stem the crimes that are committed by illegal handguns and gangs and riffraff on the streets. 
[00:40:30]  All right, Nick, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  You guys were talking about the reporters and how they kind of swarmed to these scenes and everything like that, and it broke back memories for me.  I was in the Seton Hall fire back a couple of years ago over in South Orange.  Right.  Yeah, how many died?  Three people died from the fire.  But, I mean, it was, for the next three or four days, it was just chaos.  I mean, reporters everywhere.  And a friend of mine, his roommate had passed away in the fire, and these reporters, they found out about it.  They got a hold of him.  It was this woman reporter.  You know, they're asking him all the tough questions, getting them all teary-eyed and everything like that. 
[00:41:00]  As soon as the interview's over, they turn the camera off.  The reporter turns right to her cameraman.  My friend's still standing there.  She's like, oh, I got my promotion today.  You know, cameraman high-fives and everything.  It was like a crowd of kids.  We're all standing there like, you know, we're all shocked from that shit.  But, I mean, they didn't care.  Oh, sorry.  I bet.  They didn't really care about it at all.  Like, the woman celebrating her promotion that she's going to get because she got this kid to cry, you know, and his friends just passed away.  It was just chaos from these reporters.  Yeah, what was the, was it a Michael Moore documentary where they really showed the reporters and what they really think, how they're, all they care about is how good they look on camera. 
[00:41:30]  They were doing a story about a dead girl.  A dead girl and, and they show a reporter doing take after take and he's like, ah, not, ah.  He's trying to be real somber and he's putting on this face and going like, tragedy today as we, and then, ah, he'd go, all right, all right, wait a minute, I'll do it again.  We gotta do it again, we gotta do it again.  And then, and he goes, how did my suit look?  And he starts laughing.  And he's combing his hair, making sure he looks perfect.  Does that look good?  Does this, how's this shot look?  Oh, that guy looked like the biggest douche. 
[00:42:00]  And he's like, okay, let's try it again.  And he gets a little somber again.  Yeah.  Tragedy.  They don't, they don't care.  It's obvious they don't care.  They're scumbags.  I mean, they, they, and there's a line between, you gotta detach to be a journalist.  They do a lot of dangerous things.  They go into war zones.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Some of them, sure.  Some of them are genuinely nuts.  And they go to places I would never go to get your story.  See, they're very needed, but then there's this vulture, this disgusting, blood-sucking angle to them, which has gotten, the more ratings driven, it's become the worse.  Yeah, well, that's obviously the companies, the Fox News, CNN, it's so competitive. 
[00:42:30]  Speaking of which, the local news here in New York, they're doing fluff pieces today.  I mean, to all the news stations, we have fans at all these stations, you're hacks.  If you can't just turn on your station and do some, like, real, real news today, what use are you?  What use are you to us?  You know, the story obviously has been pounded all night long, but there's plenty of opportunity for discussion, local angles, and all that stuff. 
[00:43:00]  But instead, we got examples of, you know, the astronaut running the marathon in space.  Did you really need to do that story?  You drop all that stuff today.  I get it.  You do the fluff pieces because it makes people watch a little longer.  But if you can't just turn on your station and do just basic reporting and get to the bottom of this, like we're doing today, we're shock jocks.  Shocking.  I mean, we don't like that label, but we're shock jocks. 
[00:43:30]  And we could, like, we could completely turn that off for a few days and get right to the bottom of this.  Shocking.  And instead, they're doing, they did a piece on how chocolate gets people more buzz than kissing, the old couple that took a taxi to Arizona.  That's great stories.  What is wrong with you people?  Great stories.  You drop all that stuff and you do nothing but coverage on this.  I, uh, yeah, I was watching the local news and they don't know what to do.  They don't know what to do.  I think they know that Fox and CNN does all the heavy lifting. 
[00:44:00]  Does the heavy lifting so they can do the fluff pieces.  Well, look, there's news stations out there.  We could just do the same thing.  Ah, ah, our listeners will just go to a news station today.  No, it's important.  You got to, you got to do it this way.  And about the shuttle marathon thing.  Um, she's in a vehicle doing about 25,000 miles an hour.  So I think she wins.  She finished the marathon in 0.2 seconds.  0.2 seconds.  Someone do the marathon.  I don't know.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no, no, no.  That was, I already got Steven S. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, do like dog do.  Wisconsin.  Jesus.  Maybe you could use your real name today.  Um, first 911 call at 7.15 a.m.  Police respond.  Perform initial investigation.  For all they know, it was a murder-suicide.  By now, it's 8, 8.15.  Everybody already on campus for 8 a.m.  Start of class.  How do you notify students who are on their way?  It's simple.  You got a system in place where maybe, maybe if you want to be part of this network, uh,  they, they, they give you the option.  Give us your cell number.  If any, any emergency happens, we'll, we'll send out a text. 
[00:45:00]  Because all you have to do is send out a few hundred texts to, to the students.  Yeah.  Trust me, the word gets out like that.  I also want to ask that guy.  Did he say they weren't sure if it was a murder-suicide at that point?  All they, all they know it was a murder-suicide.  All they know it was a murder-suicide?  No, they don't.  It wasn't.  Where, where was the gun?  If, if somebody shoots somebody and then shoots themselves.  It's usually right in his hand.  Usually the gun is pretty close.  Right.  You could tell if it's a murder-suicide. 
[00:45:30]  The gun is still in the, in the person's mouth.  It, it, it's clenched in his hand.  It's pretty, it's hard to get rid of the weapon after you shoot yourself in the face.  Well, you know, sometimes, you know, the, uh, your big toes on the trigger.  Yeah.  Depending on the weapon.  But in this case.  It's easy to look around the room.  Unless it's two different, uh, incidents, uh, you know.  The, the, the gun wasn't there.  Yeah.  All right, we, uh, we'll take a break.  We gotta show you some of this fluff news.  The local news is just an embarrassment.  Yeah.  And also, um, we played Bush's statement to America, which, uh, we quite frankly thought 
[00:46:00]  was a joke.  And it reminded us of, uh, uh, Reagan and how he talked to the nation after the Challenger  explosion.  And it was so much more, like, conversational and sincere sounding.  Regardless of if it was or not actually sincere.  Right.  You know, because, uh, does it really matter in the long run?  And, but the guy was able to really kind of conjure up, uh, I don't know if someone  that cared and we just heard a clip of a leader and I don't really, uh, I don't really  see, uh, a script.  I see a president that just, uh, knew the basic bullet points and just talk to America. 
[00:46:30]  And we actually found that.  And I think it's worth, uh, kind of, you know, comparing to it.  Yeah, definitely.  So we got a lot to do.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's kind of a different show today.  Good morning.  And we're, we're fine with that.  Why would I just hand in a nude picture of David Beckham? 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Completely nude.  He's doing like a Jesus Christ pose.  And, uh.  Looks like he tied a turnip around his belt loop.  Wow, they sure do things differently in Europe.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Tim in Virginia.  Tim, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Um, just calling.  I actually live about 30 miles from Tech.  Uh, to say it's kind of unreal to see, uh, every news organization here and, and watching 
[00:47:30]  them and knowing they're that close is, um, is just still kind of, uh, the whole situation  is just kind of unbelievable.  But I, I am a little upset, I think, with some of this, uh, Monday morning quarterback  in about what the campus police.  I think unless you see, really see how this campus is and how big and just everything that  is involved, I'm not saying they did everything right, but I, you know, just, uh, the people  that are pounding, they're taken by some of these students.  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but, uh, during break we were talking about it 
[00:48:00]  and I was, I was saying that they, they talk about how this is like a small town, this,  uh, college.  It's very big, a lot of people there, 26,000 people.  Uh, you, you think that after, uh, Columbine and other school shootings, uh, that there would  be something in place that would alert, especially, I think it's more important if the school is  larger, that you have something in place like an emergency, uh, alert system where at least, 
[00:48:30]  at the very least, all the faculty can be, um, texted, uh, at one time or emailed, uh, or there's  some kind of, uh, an emergency broadcast system that, that lets the people know what's going on  and what they should do at a moment's notice.  Well, how about an emergency alert thing in every class?  You walk into a deli and you can get sports scores on a scrolling thing.  Right.  How about one of those in every classroom?  Just something like an EMS, uh, EBS system. 
[00:49:00]  We don't go five minutes without checking our email in this day and age.  Yeah.  Five minutes?  So if students have, uh, their email on file with, uh, with the school, the school could  just do blast out a mass text that tells people what's going on and what they should do.  And I think that should have been done after the first shooting.  You would think that there would be something like that in place, whether you could blame  the cops, uh, the campus cops.  I don't know, because a system like that isn't in place.  So they were doing, I'm sure they were doing what they thought was best. 
[00:49:30]  But, um, one thing I got to say about the campus cops though, treadmills.  Well, that's the, that's why I just said, oh boy, they're showing the same fat guy with  the, uh, with his, uh, M16 or AR, AR probably he's, he's like, he, he is a fatty.  And then the other guy that's hiding behind a tree and he's just as wide as the tree.  Well, that, that, believe me, uh, there's plenty on the fourth of those.  Uh, they do have an email blast.  They do have that system in place. 
[00:50:00]  So I, I understand maybe about the siren or some sort of warning system.  Yeah, but what I heard was that email blast went out like three minutes before the second  shooting started.  Two hours after the first, two hours after the first one.  I'm just saying, and of course it is hindsight, but after that first one on a school campus,  you have a shooting regardless of the circumstance.  And especially when you don't know where the gunman is, which they didn't, it wasn't murder  suicide because there wasn't a gun lay in there.  So, uh, you know, alert the students to that. 
[00:50:30]  There, there could be a gunman loose.  You know, I, I went to college and if, uh, you know, I got a text or something that there  was a shooting on campus, I'm simply not going to class that day.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So just, just send it out and let the students decide.  And you have the Monday morning cornerback dude.  This is, this is not a creative decision.  You know, when there's a police thing involved, you have to, what are you going to say?  Well, you can't rethink it and do things next time.  And I have to.  And I think your professor would understand if you decided to take the day off and maybe 
[00:51:00]  missed a test or missed handing in a paper, you'd have a pretty good reason.  Like, look, I got the text that someone was shot in a dorm.  Yeah.  I was a little nervous.  So I decided to stay home today.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I understand.  And like I said, I know that the investigation, you know, it just, some of the grandstandings  what really annoys me, I guess that I know, um, you know, when, when all is said  and done, you know, tragically, maybe some of this could have been avoided.  I just, I think some of the coverage and then again, you know, we can blame it on them, 
[00:51:30]  but what was, I was blue to the TV all last night.  Uh, so I guess it's just sort of a vicious little thing.  Yeah, we do.  We do like accuse the media of being vultures, but then we just sit there and watch it all.  Oh, yeah.  You know, we, we eat it up.  Yeah.  It is kind of a, like you said, a weird little circle.  Well, both of those things can go hand in hand.  Them doing their jobs and actively covering a big story.  No one's knocking them for that.  It's, it's not about that.  It's about worrying how they look.  It's about them trying to get people to cry.  It's, it's about that, that scumbag element they bring to it.  That's about this fat guy with the AR. 
[00:52:00]  I just saw it five times since we came back from break.  They just show him.  Over and over and over again.  That are that big.  So trust me.  Yeah.  Believe me.  That's a very good representation of our police.  All right.  Thanks.  Hey, if you're on hold, you got to get right to your point because everyone wants to get  in today and we're trying to get some other things done as far as this goes.  Thank you, Tim.  Mike in Syracuse.  Thank you.  Cops thought he left town.  This is what you get for thinking.  Yeah.  Where's the proof that this guy left town?  That's what I'm asking today. 
[00:52:30]  Where's the proof where they're like, okay, this is a murder, suicide.  And we're assuming he left campus and left the state.  It was an assumption.  And he may have left campus.  It was two hours before the next shooting.  Left campus and maybe came back.  Got his chains that he used to lock the doors with.  Got the locks.  Got everything else he needed.  Loaded up on ammo.  Whatever he wanted to do.  He could have left campus.  That doesn't necessarily mean he's not coming back, which this guy apparently did.  Why don't you just alert everybody? 
[00:53:00]  I got caught, by the way.  Moe Golden from Brooklyn.  Uh-oh.  Ha-ha.  When Opie went to college, there wasn't even beepers.  Yo, hit me on the hip.  And then someone else.  Opie, text messaging wasn't yet invented when you were in school.  Good point.  Good point.  I did think of that, but I didn't know.  I thought I could sneak one by everybody.  If I would have been to college, they would have sent a carrier pigeon.  Right.  Hey, uh.  Western Union warnings.  Flash.  Gunman on campus.  Stop.  Anthony, get out of the classroom.  Stop. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, well.  Once again, here's what Bush had to say.  Just a, just a, we started the show with Bush's statement to America, which was just so lame.  Here it is again.  Just a piece.  Today, our nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at Virginia Tech.  We hold the victims in our hearts.  We lift them up in our prayers.  And we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering today.  Thank you. 
[00:54:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know what?  I'll say this for him.  I like the fact that he mentioned God, because a lot of politicians don't want to get a little  uncomfortable with that.  But maybe he's just, he's never been a great speaker that just, it just, he's just maybe not good at conveying that.  I just feel like it should come with the job.  It's one of the, I feel like it should be one of the qualifications.  You need to be able to talk to America.  You need to be able to communicate with this country.  I really, I truly feel that that should be one of the job requirements. 
[00:54:30]  Clinton actually had that talent.  He was able to kind of get up there and talk whether people liked it or not.  You know, he was able to communicate with the country like a regular guy.  Maybe we're too close to this.  We're communicators for a living.  So to me, it's like, to me, I want my president to be able to like, you know, talk from the heart.  Not use a script.  I mean, that was perfectly worded.  And if you put that to music, you've got to hit song on your hands. 
[00:55:00]  You really do.  The AC stations would eat it up.  Get Kelly Pickler or somebody to sing it.  And you got a hit on your hands.  We pulled the Reagan speech from back in the day just to show you the difference.  When the challenger exploded, the nation again grieving.  And like Amp brought up, whether he was sincere or not, I don't know.  Who knows?  But man, it gave you just a bit of comfort.  Yeah.  You got the guy in charge, like, you know, to talk to you.  He was like a father figure there, just kind of talking to you. 
[00:55:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union.  But the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.  Today is a day for mourning and remembering.  Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger.  We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country.  This is truly a national loss.  Do you hear the difference?  Yeah.  Do you hear the difference?  And you got to bring your wife into it a little bit.  When he said Nancy and I, it was just like Nancy are just out of the core. 
[00:56:00]  The families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy.  But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much.  Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace,  that special spirit that says, give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.  They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. 
[00:56:30]  They wished to serve, and they did.  They served all of us.  God, I'm getting chills.  And this happened how many years ago now?  That goddamn guy could talk.  Holy crap.  Maybe he was a special communicator, and I'm just asking for too much.  Maybe we're setting the bar a little high.  Look at the goosebumps, man.  I know.  It's so like, it brings you right back.  Holy crap.  The goosebumps today.  And then, oh, now we've got to hear the last two clips. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the...  See, and the schoolchildren watching the live coverage.  Yeah.  That was pretty much what was happening yesterday.  There were school kids all over the world watching this coverage yesterday.  And Bush gets up there and reads.  Reads keeps looking down at his dumb paper.  And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff.  I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. 
[00:57:30]  It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.  It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.  The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted.  It belongs to the brave.  The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  That's some good stuff.  It really is.  That's some good stuff.  Because of...  I think her name was Christy McCullough.  Yeah.  I think that was her name, but she was a schoolchildren.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  So he was probably speaking almost directly to our students.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who were in a classroom.  Yeah.  But, you know, you learn when you go into this profession, you've got to kind of picture who you're talking to.  And the president needed to just picture who he was trying to talk to yesterday.  Such a natural speech pattern he had, too.  Yeah.  It wasn't like that robotic, read a line, pause, read a line.  It's a very natural way he spoke, which probably was because of his acting career, he was able to do that.  But, man, if that doesn't sound sincere. 
[00:58:30]  And, look, people are beating us up like, hey, he was an awful...  They're saying he was an awful president and all that.  He was an awful.  And it's like...  I won the Cold War.  I'm just pointing out that he knew how to talk to us.  That's all.  I'm not talking about policies or anything like that right now.  I'm just making a comparison that I noticed big time when Bush spoke yesterday afternoon.  They said there was a grandfatherly quality to him that made people feel safe with him.  Like, even people that didn't like him, when it came to things like Libya, which was the big one, you know, and Muammar Gaddafi, you at least felt safe with him. 
[00:59:00]  Like, you knew that he was going to take care of things even if you didn't like him.  And people are screaming on instant feedback.  He was an actor, boys.  But Ant brought up that Clinton was really good at talking, too.  Whether you liked him or hated him.  But when he got on TV, you kind of listened because you knew it felt like it was coming right from his soul.  And you know something?  I didn't really get goosebumps watching Bedtime Brabanzo.  So whether he's an actor or not really doesn't, you know, this is good material for him then. 
[00:59:30]  I'll tell you another person.  Rudy Giuliani, love him or hate him.  Man, when he was talking during 9-11.  Wow.  If it wasn't for that dopey lisp of his.  We felt like, here in New York City especially, when he got on the news, we felt like we were in good hands.  We really did.  And people hated Rudy Giuliani on, you know, September 10th.  The old joke.  September 9th.  People really did not like Rudy in general in New York City.  They forgot all about that, a lot of people.  Because when 9-11 happened, he got on the TV and you really, really felt like we were in good hands. 
[01:00:00]  You want a leader that is a leader.  That sounds like one, looks like one, and acts like one.  And finally.  And that's what those guys had.  Finally, this will give you the real goosebumps and you might need a tissue.  I think this is the famous quote.  The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us for the manner in which they lived their lives.  We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them this morning. 
[01:00:30]  As they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye.  And slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.  Thank you.  Wow.  Wow.  That's how you bring God into a speech, by the way.  How do you toss surly into there, though?  He got it in.  Wow.  He got it in.  It worked.  He got surly in.  And then you got the dopes on instant feedback.  You know, no one cares.  This didn't affect me personally.  Move on.  An hour and a half is enough on this. 
[01:01:00]  I got another great leader that has a speech.  You want to play it for me?  See his name on the disc?  He could move people, too.  No?  You don't want to play that today?  Maybe Friday?  What?  Oh, my God.  I told Anthony, too, yesterday.  I told Anthony.  Teasing, of course.  I told Anthony yesterday off air.  He was mentioning that, what, Hitler's birthday is Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  And I go, oh, boy, something really bad is going to happen.  I swear.  Tell everybody. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I said it yesterday during a commercial break or in the office.  I'm like, great.  Something really bad is going to happen.  I swear I said that yesterday.  Well, there are things that happened, like a Columbine happened.  Eight years ago.  Friday.  Friday, right.  Because of his birthday.  Right.  That's why they did it.  It wasn't a coincidence.  It was two idiots.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt.  He's a student at Virginia Tech.  Matt, what's going on?  Yeah, I was just calling, talking back about the guns that you were talking about.  Yeah.  It's actually illegal on campus, even if you have a license and concealed a carry permit 
[01:02:00]  and all that, you can't.  Yeah, and this was just recently up for a debate, wasn't it?  Yeah, I think so.  Like, this just came up for Virginia Tech, where they were having discussions on whether  students should be able, if they're licensed gun owners, to carry on campus.  And they struck it down and said no.  Yeah.  And oops.  The other thing, too, they had another shooting the first day of school this year.  Yeah, the whole big Morva thing.  But that wasn't really localized on campus. 
[01:02:30]  That was Morva.  Yeah, that was off campus, and then the guy kind of ended up near there.  All right, Matt.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's all I got.  And they've been getting bomb threats for the past couple of weeks, and they're suspecting  that maybe this...  Just in the royal office, people trying to get out of the piss.  Yeah.  It's almost like a cry wolf kind of thing, too, because they've been getting these bomb threats.  And people are starting to speculate that this gunman was making the bomb threats to, one,  test the security at the college and see how good the security was, and to get a cry wolf 
[01:03:00]  syndrome going, where the police force would get like, all right, we got a bomb threat.  It's another one.  Another one.  Okay, we know these are fake.  And then they get a report of shootings, and they're like, what?  What is this now?  Yeah.  You know, and it kind of puts everybody, it lulls everybody into this, you know, state  of complacency where you're just kind of hanging out and not really taking it seriously. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  So the guy, if that's the case, the guy had been planning something like this for quite  some time then.  Put some effort into it.  Let's go to Kevin in Pennsylvania.  Kevin, what's up?  Love you guys.  Love the show.  By the way, Kevin has a very good observation that we all missed here in studio.  Go ahead, Kevin.  I got to call you out, Opie.  A murder, suicide, and he left town?  That's good.  Well, that's what they were saying on the news.  You're right.  How do you leave town if you just committed a murder, suicide? 
[01:04:00]  Very good, Kevin.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  All right, let's go to Mark in Lindenhurst.  Mark, what's up?  We can all relax.  Sports Radio just reported that no basketball or football players got killed.  Okay.  That's their angle today?  That's their angle.  It's very important that everybody knows that no basketball or football players got injured.  We can all move on to our daily lives.  We were kind of joking during break that Mike and the Mad Dog, they're filling in for Imus  for two weeks, and they're just known as a sports talk radio show.  Every once in a while, they'll talk movies or some big story, but they just kind of touch 
[01:04:30]  the surface.  They're in a tough position today.  It's morning radio now.  They're used to doing afternoon radio also, and they're doing both shifts now.  Now, and afternoon radio, you don't really hit on stories like this because it's just  been done all day long.  But morning radio, you got to hit all the...  You got to hit this stuff.  ...the big news.  So, you know, I don't know how used to it they are, but they got to just be sitting there.  What are they talking about?  So we were imitating Mad Dog during the break.  Shooting.  Virginia Tech, how is this going to affect the Stanley Cup playoffs?  I have no idea. 
[01:05:00]  What about you, Mikey?  Mikey, wake up for God's sake.  Wake up.  It's a very, very busy news day.  Busy news day there, Mikey.  So what do you think?  Gun control.  Yes, no.  Taking your calls.  I'm sure he's using bad call, you know.  Bad call by the people in charge down there, Mikey.  Well, you know, you can't give them any credit for taking care of the kids.  Bad call.  Bad call.  And we're taking your calls. 
[01:05:30]  What should they do?  Should the cops have gone on a diet?  I'm looking at this fat bastard over there.  What do you think, Mikey?  Damn hours.  I'd love to see Mike just, like, hitting that alarm clock in the morning.  Getting up, scratching his undercarriage, walking to the bathroom.  Son of a bitch.  I hate this fat.  Hire Imus back, for God's sake. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  People need a chuckle this morning, so we go to break with this, with no explanation.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  When we get back, we should announce the tour dates again for the Opie and Anthony Traveling  Virus Comedy Show.  Tickets go on sale.  I'm starting to hear pre-sale might happen Thursday.  Oh, I don't know.  We'll have some info on that.  But, uh, we've got a break with this.  How about this?  You don't f*** them.  There's a f***ing chimp in the building.  You bring them in something.  You just bring them.  Oh.  Ew. 
[01:06:30]  We got a little squeaky.  You're a f***ing chimp.  You sound like the door at the Addams house.  Yeah, like things, the little door.  Yeah.  When he opens his...  A little hand just popped out of his f***ing way.  Mails in.  Thank you, thing.  Holy crap.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got our ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  It's happening.  We got one date done already. 
[01:07:00]  The Vegas Show was a huge success, and we announced the other dates.  Maybe one or two more cities to be added.  But Jimmy's got the quick lineup here.  What we have is, we're doing Jones Beach here in New York, June 16th in Long Island.  The Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, June the 30th.  The Tweeter Center in Mansfield, Massachusetts, which we could not get access to last year.  We have it this year.  July 21st up for the Boston Market.  And we screwed up yesterday.  The DTE Pavilion in Detroit, August 4th. 
[01:07:30]  The Nissan Pavilion in Virginia, August 18th.  August 18th, PNC Bank Arts Center in Homedale, New Jersey, August 25th.  And then wrapping the whole shindig up September 15th at the Tweeter Center in Camden, which is for the Philadelphia people.  And after last year's unbelievable show at the Tweeter Center down there in Philly, we figured we should just end the tour there this year.  Yep.  Of course.  All the info is up on our website.  Tickets go on sale Friday, 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  I was talking to Pete yesterday, though. 
[01:08:00]  I think there might be a pre-sale starting Thursday.  Thursday morning.  We'll have more details hopefully tomorrow.  Oh, and I forgot.  Eight or nine comedians, by the way, that you know and love from the show.  We got the ONA Village videos.  It's just a whole experience.  And the main show, they're actually doing a whole big thing this Friday at the Kukilau.  Jimmy.  What?  Stop.  But don't be.  We'll do your plug later.  Okay.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  So everyone's talking about the shooting, obviously. 
[01:08:30]  And we came in to prepare for the radio show, went right to the local news, and once again,  they completely, completely disappointed me and the staff here on the Opie and Anthony show.  They're just useless is what it comes down to.  They really are.  And the local news, and we're talking about New York, but it could be in your city.  It doesn't even matter.  I know our local news is just like your local news in Buffalo, just like your local news in Pittsburgh.  It just doesn't matter. 
[01:09:00]  They all follow some dumb format, and they can't think out of the box, and they all compete for ratings and think they're the better news channel when you don't even know the difference between any of them.  No.  I mean, the only people that do are the ones that work for the number one news station in town.  But the number one news station in town is just like the number two news station in town.  There's really no difference.  And I just hope when something like this happens that they can just completely throw their format right out the window and just go with it.  Impossible. 
[01:09:30]  Just go with it.  But why did they have to do, like, fluff pieces this morning?  That's what enraged me.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  You're doing a minute piece on some dumb thing?  That could have been a minute you maybe just took live phone calls.  I don't know.  Just do something different.  Yeah, do something a little different, something that, you know, they got this big situation going on.  Mix it up a little bit.  Right.  And one person decided, one news station, Fox 5, decided to go to a firing rate.  We'll get to that in a second because that is just hilarious in its own right. 
[01:10:00]  But so, you know, the shooting's happening.  We're trying to get ready for our show.  And we do, like, bathroom humor here.  And we were able to throw that aside for today.  This is what they were doing.  Show us how good we are.  But this is what they were doing.  They had to do their fluff pieces.  We rule.  This is Channel 11 in New York.  And people do tend to work harder when there is a bigger reward, even if it's only implied.  An experiment in London used subliminal images showing a pound and a penny on a computer screen. 
[01:10:30]  Participants were told to squeeze a hand grip when each image was displayed.  Participants squeezed the hardest when they saw the more valuable pound coin.  I swear to God, this is from this morning.  This is from this morning.  What?  You're an embarrassment.  You really are.  We talked about that yesterday.  Like, if you had to squeeze something looking at money, would the denominational change make you squeeze harder?  Remember?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we did a whole, uh...  We had to be 40 minutes on it. 
[01:11:00]  All right, so that's an isolated fluff piece, right?  Yeah.  And one astronaut aboard the International Space Station had a great race.  Expedition crew member Sunita Williams took part in the Boston Marathon from 210 miles above the Earth.  Williams qualified for the 26.2 mile race last year.  Her biggest challenge wasn't completing the run, but staying harnessed to this, uh, specially designed treadmill.  She finished in four hours, 23 minutes, and 46 seconds. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  That's dedication.  That is incredible.  Just on a treadmill, that is wild.  I guess they had to keep her harnessed so she wouldn't float off, right?  That's a good part.  Yeah, so that's a great time, and check that out.  Look at her hair.  I know the hair is off.  That's hysterical.  Well, good job.  Yeah.  Oh, and by the way, 32, uh, people died at Virginia Tech yesterday.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, yeah.  Forgot about that.  Uh, another person that...  You ought to put that cop up on the space shuttle and have it strapped into that, uh, treadmill.  I've, I've seen that footage so many times, I think he also completed the Boston Marathon. 
[01:12:00]  And incidentally, four hours and something is a, uh, a crap time.  So that's a good time.  No, it's not.  It really isn't.  If you're Heather Mills, it's a good time.  Yeah.  If you're an astronaut, it stinks.  Plus, you're not really getting tired, so I think you could do it a little faster than that.  And I like the fact that the one reporter said they keep her harnessed in, uh, like,  he, he had to explain why she's in...  What do you think it is?  Yeah.  But people see what's going on here.  This is what they're doing this morning. 
[01:12:30]  Why fluff pieces today?  Here's another one.  In today's Fit for Life, can you get buzzed off chocolate?  Well, according to British researchers, chocolate jumpstarts the heart more than smooching your sweetheart.  Couples in their 20s were hooked up to heart monitors and had electrodes attached to their scalp.  They were given a chunk of dark chocolate to melt on their tongues and then told to kiss.  The chocolate provided a stronger buzz that lasted four times longer and increased their heart rate more than locking lips.  Well, I'm sure in front of those researchers, it couldn't have been that comfortable. 
[01:13:00]  You're an embarrassment.  Chocolate or a kiss.  This is what they're doing.  Why don't they show you the rush you get when you kiss someone for the first time as opposed to the same pair of dumb lips you've been staring at for five years?  You understand?  That's kind of a biased test.  It's a sugar, first of all, yeah.  It's a rush.  Caffeine, too, in chocolate.  Amazing, right?  Stupid story.  And then filler.  I mean, we could do this all morning, but one more example.  Well, Bob and Betty Matas' big adventure is finally over.  Listen to this.  After six days in a taxi, they have finally made it to Arizona. 
[01:13:30]  The Matas' hired a cabbie to move them from Queens to their retirement home in Sedona because they didn't want to take their two cats on an airplane.  They paid the cabbie $3,000 plus gas, meal, and lodging money.  At least they got one of those nice new hybrids.  At least.  Right?  Yeah.  I guess it was as comfortable as it can be.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good conversation.  Yeah.  Coming up, Nick, much more on that campus massacre at Virginia Tech as the university begins a day of mourning and investigators search for a motive. 
[01:14:00]  There you go.  Good segue.  We did the taxi story and the cat.  Thank God we got the taxi story out of the way first.  A humorous note on that cab.  Meow.  How about you take your cats and you put them on the plane and you smack their faces and say, shut up.  Stop whining.  You buy them $500 worth of catnip.  You're still ahead $2,500.  You know how that story started to an old couple.  They're like shopping and it's rush hour and they had to get back to Queens, which no cabbie wants to do during rush hour. 
[01:14:30]  And this guy pulled over and was like, oh, I'll take you.  And they struck up a little friendship and then they decide that this is the way they want to go from New York to Arizona.  I bet you they realized it was a horrific idea somewhere around, I don't know, Ohio.  Yeah.  Like, what were we thinking?  It sure seemed like a good idea.  He was a radical Jew hater.  Yeah.  All he wanted to listen to was NPR.  Haitian cabbie Jew hater. 
[01:15:00]  Hates Arizona.  Thinks all faggots live there.  That's all you're talking about for 2,800 miles.  God, this guy's awful.  How only queers like dry heat.  And, of course, I said that that was the last one, but this one, we can't ignore this one.  Jeremy's adorable, furry new celebrity experiencing some growing pains.  Little polar bear Newt was taken off public display at the Berlin Zoo today because he's teething.  The four and a half month old cub was put on antibiotics and sent to rest. 
[01:15:30]  Zoo officials don't know if Newt will be strong enough for public appearances in the coming days.  They say the little one is not a machine.  What is the logic?  What is the logic behind these fluff pieces on a day like today?  I was saying that in the office.  I was agreeing with you until I realized we're having a chimpanzee on today.  Well, yeah.  We're doing the chimp segment.  Well, we aren't the news.  No, that's true.  Now you're making us look silly, but yeah.  That's what I was trying to do. 
[01:16:00]  They were already en route, and it was a chimp that Jimmy worked with.  That's Jimmy's friend.  Mikey the Chimp is going to be on our show later on today when we're on our next set.  Little Mikey, I'm so excited.  And you did some research on this?  I did.  I saw in our email.  I saw he got a little guest one sheet like we get for our celebrity guests on what he's done.  And I went to his website, and I checked out on YouTube, Little Mikey playing poker.  Apparently, it was Little Mikey that there was a little controversy on a World Series of Poker this year 
[01:16:30]  because somebody wanted to enter a monkey, a chimp, some poker website.  And that chimp was Mikey.  So they did this whole video of him and some poker player playing poker.  And Mikey's just awful at poker.  He doesn't know what the chips are.  He throws them at the dealer.  He was throwing the chips at the dealer.  And eating them, right?  And eating them, and the dealer at one point had to say, don't eat the dealer button.  He's got it in his mouth.  And then he was punching the guy that he was playing poker with. 
[01:17:00]  Just like, because the guy that he was playing poker with was yelling at Mikey.  He's screaming at him.  Going, what are you doing?  You're not even betting right.  Like, he's yelling at him.  And then Mikey would lean over and punch him in the head.  So I guess you shouldn't yell at Mikey when he comes in.  Well, other than that, if he's having a bad game, he's never been a good card player.  We discussed that before.  Yeah, he hates it.  He likes goldfish.  He likes to play goldfish and then throw feces at whoever beats him.  He was throwing the chips at everybody. 
[01:17:30]  And then he would just grab the chips off the table and throw them on the floor.  He's really a rambunctious little chimpanzee.  I know.  I can't wait to see him in a radio studio.  There's nothing there that can get broken.  Oh, no.  Great.  And he does seem to like to take his fists and pound on, like, the tables and stuff.  Great.  And he stands up on it and does that jump thing where they just jump up and down and slam.  Yeah.  He's adorable.  We're going to put him in Ron and Fez's office.  Let him just crap all over the place. 
[01:18:00]  This was Jimmy's idea.  I hope the chimp bites a part of your body off you.  I know.  I know.  I'll probably, like, I'll think, like, I hope he remembers me.  They say he always remembers people that he likes, but it's been a couple of years.  So I'll probably go to, like, say hello, and he's just going to take his chimp fist  and drill it into my stupid lipless mouth.  There you go.  I can't wait to hear this.  Where's the chimp?  Oh, he's filling out paperwork.  Yeah, no kidding.  He's got to fill out paperwork.  Let's go to Amelia in Rhode Island.  Amelia.  Hi.  Hi.  Did you guys notice a news anchor when you did that taxicab story? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  The male news anchor goes, ah, after the woman said more about that shooting in Virginia.  Yeah.  And none of you guys commented on it.  Oh, he went, ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're useless.  They really are useless.  I mean, the network news makes the local news look just, I don't know, like preschoolers,  whatever, whatever you want to say.  But it's just, you can't even compare the two. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you, Amelia.  Greg wants to defend the news.  Greg.  Greg.  What news station do you work for?  None.  How do you defend that they're doing fluff pieces this morning?  Well, first of all, some of the fluff pieces and everything are made a couple of days in  advance or whatever, so they don't know what's going to be the big story.  That's true.  You know, like you said, they jumped on Imus and everything.  That wouldn't have been a big story if it happened this week.  Yeah, Imus would still have a job, but Greg.  And you said at the very beginning of your show that how many times have you seen that 
[01:19:30]  same video?  How many times have you done this or heard that or whatever?  You know, there's no new development.  They got a four-hour news program.  You know, they got to fill it with something.  We're talking about mixing it up, though, a little bit.  Yeah, wait a minute.  You're taking a new angle on things.  Greg, we have a four-hour radio show.  This is the easiest show you can do.  You just go to the phone and let people talk about it.  And as far as the fluff pieces being produced ahead of time, that's all well and good, but  they didn't have to play them today.  They could save them for later in the week or next week. 
[01:20:00]  The chocolate story is not going anywhere.  Right.  Do you understand that?  Okay, here's another little thing there.  Yesterday, you said you were so tired, which, you know, is understandable and everything,  that you were just going to call it in and go home early and whatever.  But see, you have something to help that along.  You've got people that you can, you know, plunk down the phones, you know, people coming  in, you know, some kind of, you know, diversion going on. 
[01:20:30]  So do they.  So do they.  Hey, you know how many people work on a news program?  What's that?  We've been interviewed by a lot of local news people.  You know how many people are behind the scenes?  And you have all those people and they can't figure out how to make this more relevant  today?  I completely disagree with you.  I mean, I understand, like, the basic stuff.  Like, here in New York, we're dealing with floods.  So that's a big story.  You've got to hit on that.  You wanted to hit on some sports.  You want to hit on the weather.  I get all that.  But I'm talking flat out the fluff pieces.  Get rid of them.  That gives you another few minutes per newscast to really get into this a little bit. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, you know, this story is just developing and stuff so that, you know,  that maybe there's just no news right now, you know, so.  You know what, though?  They fill it in with a couple of minutes of fluff pieces.  But soon as I mean, we watched the fluff pieces today because we really want to make,  you know, kind of a statement about that today on our show.  But the average person, I think, when they see a fluff piece, they're gone.  So they're not even doing themselves a disservice, actually.  You're telling your viewers, ah, we don't really have much on this. 
[01:21:30]  So why don't you go to CNN or the Fox News channel or MSNBC?  Did you enjoy the fluff pieces, sir?  He's a fluff piece fan.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Thanks.  You're vehement about your defense.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  That guy was out of his mind with the fluff piece.  Obsessed.  Loved him.  That's all he wants.  He wants to talk about that newt, the stupid polar bear.  What about the kick?  Yeah.  We just like to see how...  I'm going to kick the little guy.  Newts are queer.  We just like to see how the local news handles this type of thing. 
[01:22:00]  And it's very interesting if you really, really pay close attention.  And then Fox 5, their angle was to go to a shooting range and I guess show the weapon that was used.  I guess the weapon they assume was used.  Which is what?  A 9mm.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the warning before the...  Handgun.  The warning that this broad, this news broad gives is...  Kind of funny.  It's ridiculous.  Listen to this. 
[01:22:30]  And keep in mind, by the way, because she dramatically intros her piece.  Yeah.  Knowing full well that all we've seen for the last, I don't know, 12, 16 hours is bloody, bloody bodies on TV.  Yeah, they've shown dragging out the bloody body.  The video phone where you could hear the shots.  Yeah, you know what is happening each time you hear one of those bangs.  So we saw all that as viewers, but she felt like she had to give this dramatic warning before her piece. 
[01:23:00]  Well, we came out here to a firing range in Queens because we wanted to talk to an expert.  But I have to warn you here.  Some people watching may consider the video you're about to see graphic.  What do you think you're going to see?  Graphic.  What do you think you're going to see?  Hopefully her on the shooting range with a bullet tearing through her accidentally.  And she goes, wait.  Here's what I actually thought they might have shown.  I thought they had another video phone.  No, no, because they said they were at a firing range. 
[01:23:30]  I thought they were going to show some kind of maybe a like pig carcass.  Because they do this on like Mythbusters sometimes.  Like a pig carcass and take a 9mm and show the type of damage a bullet can do.  And that would be kind of graphic.  Because I'm trying to think.  And that's like the first thing that popped in my head.  But I'm trying to think, what could be graphic at a firing range?  Yeah.  And then she explains what is so graphic.  Well, we came out here to a firing range in Queens because we wanted to talk to an expert. 
[01:24:00]  But I have to warn you here.  Some people watching may consider the video you're about to see graphic.  The very first thing you're going to see is a gun being fired.  That was 25.  That's it.  That was the warning.  That they were actually going to show footage of a gun being fired.  So they show a side view of a hand holding a gun at the range and pulling the trigger and firing.  That's graphic? 
[01:24:30]  That was graphic.  Meanwhile, they showed that photograph of a person, whether they're alive or dead, I don't know, but full of blood.  A bullet hole in their side, a bullet hole in their thigh, being carried out by four police officers.  What about 30,000 times I saw that?  What about the big student?  You don't know if he's alive or dead with the blood on his leg?  Is that one of those?  Yeah.  But they haven't even told you if that guy lived or not?  No.  There's like three guys trying to carry this person out?  And I haven't heard anything about that being graphic. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  And she goes, now I have to warn you.  This is graphic.  Like, are people that crazy where if they see a gun being fired, they just lose their mind?  They're just out of touch.  They really are.  It's her way of getting you to watch a little more by keeping it interesting.  Yeah.  Graphic.  Graphic.  Warning.  Graphic is the front page of the Daily News today.  Left to die.  32 slaughtered on VA Tech campus.  As security breaks down.  And that's the picture I just referred to.  Actually, it's four people carrying the student out. 
[01:25:30]  Blood everywhere.  All over his legs.  Bullet hole in the thigh.  Bullet hole in the side.  Is that a bullet hole in the side of his chest?  Yeah.  That I'm looking at?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's graphic.  Yeah.  That's a lot of graphic.  And we all saw this on TV yesterday.  God, I just, I can't tell you enough.  Oh, belly dancing.  Well, now they're doing belly dancing.  On CW11 News.  Well, CW, this is actually deep for them.  Yeah.  Oh, there's an ass wiggle.  Oh, that's funny.  Look, the news girl's doing a funny little belly dance. 
[01:26:00]  This is terrific.  Oh, some kind of bikini teeny.  And some kind of tranny making some kind of drink.  A tranny.  What the hell is that?  Yeah, cheers to you.  The cameraman's all mad.  She's got a drink on his lens.  The Asian girl's trying to move her ass.  Yeah, but we all know.  It's just there's no way to get something that flat.  Yeah.  It's an awful ass.  She really has a horrid ass, that girl.  You want to hear the rest of this firing range story? 
[01:26:30]  Please, it's graphic.  That was 25 bullets firing out of a 9mm gun.  The same type of gun the shooter unloaded on the classroom, killing 30 students.  But he didn't have just one 9mm.  He had two.  John DeLuca owns Seneca's boarding range.  An 18mm?  What?  And he says you can empty a 9mm semi-automatic in seconds.  That's as soon as you squeeze the trigger.  The gun will go off as fast as you can pull that trigger.  By the way, let's go a little deeper with this. 
[01:27:00]  The only reason they did this fluff piece from the firing range, because the news program saw that kid's cell phone footage, the shaky footage, because he was completely freaked out as he pushed, you know, record.  Yeah.  And the news went, man, we almost had it.  We almost had something really, really good.  But you know what?  If we go to a firing range and use the same gun used, that would be pretty dramatic for our viewers.  Yes.  Don't you think?  We'll put a graphic disclaimer.  How does that help? 
[01:27:30]  Puppies!  Oh, puppies on the news now!  No, puppies!  Oh, the church challenge!  When was the...  What was the question?  The most recorded rainfall or something.  Oh, really?  And then they give you years to choose from.  All right.  Tyra's got a kangaroo on!  Aw, and the other news station has a cute dolphin story!  The kangaroo is hopping.  What's going on with the dolphin?  The kangaroo is hopping.  I want to bring a kangaroo on, and I want it to jump up and kick Iraq in the chest.  I could kill him.  By the way, coming up on CW11, they're modeling new summer swimwear. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, sexy.  Oh, my God.  And they look at us and, like, put their noses in the air like, shock jocks.  Really?  We're doing more heavy lifting than you, idiots.  The, uh...  You want more of this story, by the way?  Don't tell me there's more.  Just a quick report.  The reporter finds out how long it takes to reload.  And he had to stop and reload.  How much time are we talking about there, and how much thought process has to go into that? 
[01:28:30]  A split second.  He dropped the magazine and reloaded the next clip.  The next magazine into the firearm.  Now, the university took two hours to notify the campus about the first shooting, and they did so using email.  Security expert Michael McCann believes that that will be a focus of the investigation.  In my experience, the quicker you notify people, the better.  Even if you don't have all the information, get a message out to people telling them what's going on, that it's being evaluated, it's being investigated, and at least they know, and that they're not walking into an unknown. 
[01:29:00]  All right, well, they got...  That's kind of a non-story.  Yeah, they got some info out there.  What can I tell you?  Hey, let's say hi to Steve in Philly.  Steve, what's going on today?  Hey, Owen, how's it going?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, you know, I'm listening to your show, man, from the afternoons over in Philly during 9-11.  And you guys, your show was cutting edge, and you were all comedy and all, but man, you were so professional.  And I couldn't listen to any news station.  And I had to listen to you guys because these a-holes that were on the news were doing the same thing that they're doing now. 
[01:29:30]  So hats off to you, man.  You did a great job.  You got to know how to just shift gears when it's really important like today.  I mean, that seems to be pretty obvious, but I guess maybe it's not to a lot of people.  Thank you, Steve.  I really appreciate that compliment.  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mike, what's going on?  How are you guys doing today?  All right, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  I just wanted to give a quick point of The Simpsons.  When Ken brought his talk on his story about, like, a kitten having a bunch of kittens,  and he's like, oh, by the way, the Pope got shot seven times more than 11. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, The Simpsons did a very good job with the fluff pieces.  Absolutely.  That's right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I saw a guy last night on the news.  I guess we'll talk about it.  Did you hold up your little break sign, Dan?  Yeah.  Oh, goody.  Yeah, we'll talk about it after that.  But it's a guy that would not stop, no matter what they talked about, about violent video games.  He had brought it up and was being questioned by the press about this situation, and he  would not stop.  No matter what they asked, he'd turn it around into violent video games or other cause. 
[01:30:30]  They couldn't get that out of their mouths fast enough last night.  That's the hard-hitting part of this whole problem that they'll focus on.  Oh, for this they're talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  Not the fact that he's Asian and he's obsessed with this girl.  I don't know why Asian is doing it, but he's an obsessed foreign national who just  couldn't handle a breakup.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let's go to the Outer Banks.  Violent video games.  By the way, how do they, like, the Civil War, that type of vicious murder, what was  that blamed on?  Yeah, exactly.  Stop it.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Joe from the Outer Banks.  Joe?  Yeah, I've been switching back and forth only because some of the news stations are bringing  the update that I guess he was a student and that's how he got in the dorm.  Yes.  One, because he was a resident of that dorm.  Okay, yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah, and two, one other thing just quick.  You know, there's a lot of questioning on why didn't the students try to, you know, subdue  this guy?  And I've been shot at before and I think the only thing that goes through your head is  get to the safest place you can without getting shot. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, there's...  Wait, sorry to interrupt you.  Who's been questioning that they should have subdued him?  A lot of people.  Really?  That's another thing coming out of the news.  Like, why didn't they, like, you know, tackle the guy or something?  If you got a room full of people, you'd figure, you know, somebody's going to make the big  rush, but they don't.  Who wants to be the front line?  You guys get behind me.  I'll take a few in the building.  Yeah.  We all think we'd be a hero in that situation, but I don't know about that.  I think we're all, you know, just taking care of ourselves.  You need equal footing, which means a gun. 
[01:32:00]  Gun versus gun.  Gun, and then you just...  I'll tell you one thing.  If a classroom full of people had guns, a guy'd be Swiss cheese, laying on the floor,  mission accomplished.  It just doesn't happen the way people would think it would happen.  Like, oh, you're going to subdue it.  You know what?  For the kids that, you know, put their feet up against the doors and did what they could,  you know what?  God bless them, because those kids, I mean, did way above and beyond what, you know, anyone  else would have done, and it's really amazing. 
[01:32:30]  And what happened was just terrible, man.  Terrible.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  He came back three times to that classroom.  That was terrifying.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, I was watching the Situation Room yesterday, and they had that guy, and they were just waiting  for shit to happen, and they had this doctor come on explaining how, like, gunshot wounds  happened, and they were sitting there talking about it for, like, 20 minutes.  The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.  At least Wolf Blitzer has a situation in the Situation Room.  Yeah.  Because most times when I turn on the Situation Room, there's not really a situation going 
[01:33:00]  on.  It's really who cares.  It's who cares stuff.  Just the fact that that horse's ass had to name it something in a music bed.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da.  Situation Room.  I think, Wolf, you can't have a situation every day.  That's why that doesn't work.  We have a situation.  We could call this the Situation Room today, and hopefully by the end of the week, we'll  be doing poopy humor again.  Uh, well, sir.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Now that he listens to himself.  All right.  Let's take a break. 
[01:33:30]  We'll continue.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  You know, we could touch on a couple other things.  The Richard Gere story is pretty interesting.  Yeah?  Yeah.  India is pissed.  Can you get the Richard Gere story?  Do they worship gerbils?  Uh, it's, it's, it's even...  Nothing on that?  All right.  It wasn't a great joke.  No, it was pretty good.  Okay.  It was kind of corny.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  It was a little hacky and old and dated.  Good Lord.  All right.  I'll accept that. 
[01:34:00]  There we go.  Okay.  Terrific.  Back goes Griffey looking up.  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  I have a better joke.  Yeah.  All right.  Why are they mad at him?  I know why.  He didn't behave like an officer or a gentleman.  Oh, no, no.  Beanie wearing Jew boy. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  Wow.  How about one more?  Hold on a minute.  Because he, uh, he said he just had to kiss that pretty woman.  Halfway rebound.  God.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'm telling you something.  How does that not go in?  I know why.  Because the first thing he did when he got there was he raped a hamburger. 
[01:35:00]  I was only joking.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  What a dope that guy was.  I'm a bad boy.  No one believed him.  Dude, he never had.  Day one.  No one believed him.  He never had sex with her.  He just flung it out of, like, multiple MiGs and she drove by.  Hit the windshield.  All right.  Uh, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. 
[01:35:30]  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Excuse me.  What was that?  A little flegum.  Yeah, a lot of us got sick from the Vegas trip.  Uh, the O and A virus spreading across America and spreading, spreading throughout my lungs  as we speak. 
[01:36:00]  Uh, Jim Norton's going to be leaving us again this weekend.  No, no, I'm with you for Friday, though.  But I'm here Friday because I'm only doing it.  Friday.  Friday.  You're here?  Yes.  Uh, and Friday night I'll be up in the, uh, uh, uh, Hooky Lao.  Hooky Lao.  And Chick-A-P-E Mass.  Ugh.  Why is it called Chick-A-P-E?  I don't know.  We lived up there and I always...  Chick-A-P-E.  I always thought to myself, that could be the silliest name for a town.  Sounds like an Indian tribe.  It's awful.  Chick-A-P-E.  Chick-A-P-E Indians.  I don't know.  What do I know?  Thai restaurant.  I'm doing whatever. 
[01:36:30]  Two shows.  What is this?  What?  I'll be selling my new Frunkist shirts.  Yeah, the Frunkist shirts.  They went over well at the, uh, at the show in Vegas.  The Frunkist shirts.  The brand new Jim Norton T-shirts.  We should, uh, try to find the silliest town name in America.  Can you beat Chick-A-P-E?  Hey, how about that, people?  Can you beat Chick-A-P-E?  Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, let's say hi to Ron.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  I hope you're doing Anthony and, uh, Jim.  Love you guys. 
[01:37:00]  I got XM Radio in my work truck.  Thank you, Ron.  Thanks, Ron.  Thank you.  I wanted to make a comment about the violent video games.  You were saying, uh, it's exactly true that, uh, your eye and the hand and eye coordination  for shooting a weapon will be excellent.  And also, you will be able to learn how to get away with four stars.  And, uh, I believe that's a very serious thing.  There you go.  He was making a little, um, Grand Theft Auto joke.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dennis in Philly.  Dennis, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, so I'm, uh, driving, uh, to, we just got those, uh, Bud Light libraries in Philly. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Which we all love.  But, uh, advertising Bud Light in the morning is, if I'm the only one that thinks that's insane.  It's part of a complete breakfast.  You have your cereal and, uh, toast, juice, and a Bud Light.  You know what, though?  It, it, it might, uh, sound insane at, uh, you know, six in the morning.  But, you know what?  After the day's over. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Subliminally, you're going to be picking up a Bud Light and you're not even going to know why.  I got a fridge full.  When I go home, pop one open.  Because we put the thought in your head in the morning.  That's how we work.  All right, Dennis.  Thank you.  All right.  Good observation.  Hey, we got the girl from Sexy Estate on the line.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Anyone else think about this yesterday when the whole streaming thing went down?  Oh, yeah.  Got to explain for this side of the, uh, the show.  Yesterday over at XM, we had this girl, Jenny, and this guy, uh, who cares what his name was. 
[01:38:30]  Is it Jenny?  Vince.  All right.  Jenny and Vince called up.  And they wanted to play a little game we like to call Sexy Estate.  Yep.  And basically, you know, uh, they do the deed.  And then we decide if it's sexy enough to be, uh, be called Sexy Estate in America.  Yeah.  And while she called up with a very unusual one, she was at her, uh, ex-boyfriend's house.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, her new boyfriend was home. 
[01:39:00]  Uh, or at work.  Or at work, somewhere.  She was at work.  She made the excuse that she was out with her friend Heidi.  Heidi.  But she wasn't out with Heidi.  No, she was with Vince, her ex-boyfriend.  And, um, she said she, uh, sees Vince sometimes because Vince is much better.  Much better and much, uh...  Much better in, you know, action and, uh, physically.  That's right.  He's better.  Uh, than her current boyfriend. 
[01:39:30]  But we don't really understand why she's with the current boyfriend if she still likes the, uh, the ex-boyfriend.  Well, Vince doesn't want to commit, was her excuse.  And the other guy kind of pays her bills.  Yeah.  Pays the bills.  So she's kind of got the best of both worlds.  Oh, she does.  She's got the guy, you know, paying her bills.  And then she goes and makes excuses and she still, uh, has sex with the ex-boyfriend.  So, they called the show and who are we to stand in their way?  They decided they wanted to do it for us and our audience.  And we thought it'd be kind of fun to actually have her call her new boyfriend while she was having sex with her ex-boyfriend. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-huh.  Literally calling during the act.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was on the phone.  And we're like, act normal.  And she was trying to explain where she was and that she'll be home soon and to get, what, sushi and wine.  Yeah.  And.  Yeah, they had a conversation about dinner and what they were going to have.  And she was talking about, like, yeah, I'm feeling better.  And, um, as, as she's saying all this, you could hear when certain things were happening because she wasn't able to, uh, carry on a normal conversation without, uh, like certain barking sounds coming out. 
[01:40:30]  Her voice changed.  Her voice would change during certain moments.  It sounded something like somebody was rapidly punching stew.  I want to laugh so hard that I would have heard.  Jimmy, don't do that.  No laughs today.  So we got an update because, uh, I don't know, when the school shooting happened and we heard it was a domestic thing and we're like, oh my God. 
[01:41:00]  Because they did call, by the way, from, uh, down there.  Somewhere.  Yeah.  Somewhere in the D.C. area.  Uh, let's see how did Jenny get an update.  Jenny from D.C.  What's up, Jenny?  Hey.  You were the star of the radio show yesterday.  Oh, that's, uh, I guess.  Yeah.  I feel really bad.  You felt bad?  Well, um, remember how I told him I had a headache?  Yeah.  When I came home, he'd gotten me flowers.  Oh, what a guy. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, because I gotta explain, hold on, I gotta explain.  While Jenny was, uh, having, uh, sex with her ex-boyfriend, while she was on her cell phone with her new boyfriend,  and the guy obviously realized something wasn't quite right, so he's asking her, you know, what's wrong, and she's, Jenny was saying she went out drinking with Heidi, and she's got a little hangover, a little headache.  So when you got home, there were flowers waiting for you.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Let me tell you something.  And this idiot you're dating, he's a cuckold.  He's a cuckold, and, uh, what you ought to do is tie him up, and then make him watch you and Vince, and then rip his stupid flowers up and throw them at him. 
[01:42:00]  And then Vince will leave, and you can untie the boyfriend, and, uh, he'll still stay with you.  And, um, before I went for work this morning, he told me I was wonderful.  Yeah.  Did you, uh, and him, um, have, uh, sexual relations last night after he gave you flowers?  Twice.  Twice.  That's good.  So he, like, so, so, yeah, you had sex with your ex, and then, and then you had sex with, uh, your, your current boyfriend. 
[01:42:30]  I think Anthony wants to know, did you, did you take a bath and do a headstand and then take another bath?  Yeah.  Did you, did, did you shower?  Yes.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Um, anyway, um, so that's, uh, huh?  A whore.  No kidding.  I mean, lover.  We love you, Jenny.  Our, our audience loves you.  Well, someone made the observation, because we were all listening in on this thing that was beyond unbelievable. 
[01:43:00]  We haven't had a bit like that in a while.  And a lot of guys called going, look, guys, this is what sucks about this bit.  We're not the ex-boyfriend.  We're the sep at home.  Yeah.  And then everyone was calling yesterday going,  and when that whole thing went down, we, uh, we're, everyone was looking at their cell  phone, praying that their cell phone wasn't going to be the one ringing.  Don't ring.  No, he doesn't listen to the show, so I knew it would be all right.  So he's a queer.  Good thing.  Yeah, see?  He doesn't listen, so good for him.  He thinks you're immature. 
[01:43:30]  Good, you're cheating on him.  Ew, does he?  Anyway, I have to go to work.  Wait, wait, wait.  He thinks our show, hold on a minute.  He thinks our show's, uh, immature?  He thinks, yeah, he thinks the show is silly.  Well, could you call back and do the same exact thing, you know, soon?  Absolutely.  We'll take it to the next level, though, just a little bit, a little bit.  This time on his birthday.  Yeah.  All right?  I want you to be doing something, and he goes, why do you sound really weird?  And you go, well, I'm in the dentist's office getting a checkup, and I got all sorts of 
[01:44:00]  instruments in my mouth, but I love you so much, I had to call you in the middle of this.  I'd want something else.  Yeah?  I'd want her, uh, with maybe her voice muffled a little because her face is in the pillow.  Yeah.  Oh, he said-  And Vince is staring at the back of her head.  Absolutely.  He actually said we're immature.  Uh, promise us, Jenny, you'll call soon and do the exact same thing with, uh, with Vince,  and, uh, we'll, we'll take it to the next level.  Okay, I will.  Love you guys.  All right.  There goes Jenny.  There's the update.  Hey, by the way, I got really- 
[01:44:30]  A little slut whore.  Oh, she's great.  I got really distracted, and I don't think anybody else is gonna, uh, come up with this observation  that I just came up with.  Ooh.  Just came up with.  Look at this picture right here.  Mm-hmm.  I know what you mean.  You notice?  Yep.  Did you notice?  Okay.  You go to the Daily News, or, you know, the New York paper, it's on the, on the, uh, front  page of the Daily News.  Oh, my God.  It's a picture of one of the students being carried out by, by four, uh, officers.  Okay?  They got, um, you know, each guy has a leg, and then each guy has an arm. 
[01:45:00]  He's the guy in the red shirt, really bloody legs, really bloody abdomen, a bullet hole in  the side of his chest, right?  What the hell is that?  Listen, Ant.  I just saw this exact picture on the news, and they blurred out his crotch area.  So, immediately, I'm like, why are they blurring out his crotch area?  So, I picked up the front page of the Daily News.  They did not catch this before they, uh, got the paper out to everybody.  That's his junk.  Hold it. 
[01:45:30]  That's his junk.  Where?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  No, because there's a couple of things happening here that I don't get.  Like what?  This?  Up top?  Yeah.  What's this?  That, I don't know.  Dude, what is?  What?  A belt, probably.  No?  A belt?  It's either a belt, or he's, uh...  Wow.  Or he's really...  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  What is that?  What is that?  Well, because...  They did blur it out, though, but they might have...  That looks like... 
[01:46:00]  Dude, I have an awful, awful suggestion here that it was shot off, kind of.  No.  No.  And that looks like some debris up top, and it kind of is...  Because what is this?  It's hanging straight down.  It looked...  That's not his penis.  That's his belt.  It just...  It's just not...  He has a belt?  Whatever it is, it's...  Honestly, it's too long hanging down.  Yeah, it is.  It's not a penis.  But this up here is?  Absolutely.  On the front page of the Daily News today, you see the guys... 
[01:46:30]  I don't want them dumping out, so...  You see...  Penis.  Penis.  They're going to dump out them, bro.  Why?  You can say penis?  I hope so.  You never know with these guys.  But anyway, on the front page, the guy's junk is out and flailing in the wind, and they  just...  They just...  Cubed that out on the news.  There's two...  Now, I'm wondering if the news saw that and then said didn't know what it was, so  cubing it to be...  Like, Travis, what are you showing? 
[01:47:00]  What are you doing, Travis?  Making copies of it to hand out to people?  Yeah.  No, uh, the exact photo in the post doesn't seem to have it.  What?  They photoshopped it.  Did they photoshop it out?  They absolutely photoshopped it.  You can see where they, uh...  Oops, oops.  ...edited the background graphs.  Let me see.  What page?  On page nine.  Front page of the Daily News, it is what it is.  It's the guy's junk, and in the post, they actually photoshopped it out.  Oh my god, they did. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  Here, can you show this?  Did you show this to the pal talkers?  The violent image is okay.  Yeah, the blood and guts is fine, and the bullet holes is fine, but we better photoshop the  penis off this picture.  Amazing, right?  That is absolutely photoshopped out.  Isn't that wild?  No, wouldn't it be ironic if this one was photoshopped in...  Yeah, somebody...  Some creep.  Anyway, but I saw on the news, they cubed out the area of this kid.  I'm like, what is going on? 
[01:48:00]  And I reached for the paper, and sure enough, I missed it when I saw it this morning when  I got in.  That's a little...  I don't know which one's more unethical.  The one that left it in, or the one that photoshopped it out.  Pretty wild, no?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we got White Guy on the line.  White Guy, what's up?  What's up?  Guys, I was just going to say, imagine if that thing hanging between his legs was his junk. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, that's a belt.  No, it's a belt.  You could see it in the...  You could definitely see it in the New York Post version, that it's a belt, because it's  a closer shot.  Yeah.  Great show, guys.  Love you.  I want to see this thing I zoomed in on.  I think that is what that is, though.  It's kind of an awkward angle, though, but...  Let's go to Pat in New York.  Pat, what's up?  That's terrible.  What's up, man?  Hey.  I tell you, that girl's a slut and a half, bro.  That's not right what she's doing.  Yeah, well...  Can I get a number anyway?  No, dude.  The bottom line is this.  He's not a fan of the show. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  He deserves it.  If he was a fan of the show, then we would tell Jenny to stop immediately.  Cut the malarkey.  But the guy called us immature.  He has no idea what his girlfriend's doing.  And we broadcasted the whole thing for everybody over at XM.  Rob in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey.  Listen, dude, love the show, man.  I got to tell you, since that whole Jenny thing, though, she's a great guy.  I wish I could meet her.  But every time my girlfriend calls me now and says she's with her friends,  I got to think a little bit harder now.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  All right.  I hate her for doing that.  I hate her for doing that now.  My girlfriend, last night, I told her how we did this. 
[01:49:30]  And she's like, yeah, my friend just invited me to Rome.  This girl, she knows.  She lives in Rome.  No way.  Yeah.  I mean, I...  But for the 18th to the 22nd, like, leaving, like, tomorrow for four days,  because her best friend lives in Rome now.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, my girlfriend stayed at her grandparents' house tonight.  Yeah, great.  Wait, no, no.  Hold on now.  And then her best friend has a fiancé, so it's not like they'd be out in clubs every night.  You know?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:50:00]  So she might go to Rome.  And I'm like, but isn't that, like, romance?  She's like, no, I've been there.  It's a very romantic city out here, Jimmy.  Yes.  Oh, that's going to just drive you nuts.  It's going to be some...  She's going to come back, walk you with a limp, and, like, humming, Mamma Mia, dirty girl.  Not going to Rome.  Rome.  By the way, for the rest of the country, it's on foxnews.com.  I believe the same picture we're looking at today.  Oh.  It's pixelated.  Thank you, Kat from New Jersey.  Not cubed out.  Thank you.  Thanks for correcting me, all right? 
[01:50:30]  Hey, by the way, we might know the kid that's on the front page of the Daily News.  Are you kidding?  No.  My, one of the kids that writes for my site just called me and said, yeah, that guy that  you guys are talking about, he's my friend, Kevin.  And so Travis is getting him on the phone right now.  That guy.  He's okay?  He's okay.  From what Josh was just telling me, a kid got shot twice, but he's been in the hospital  all night with him.  Oh, we're not going to get him on the phone, are we?  I don't think we'll get the kid on the phone.  We're going to get Josh on the phone to talk about him. 
[01:51:00]  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Oh, here's Josh right here.  Uh, Josh.  Hey guys, what's up?  You know the kid that's on the front page of the Daily News?  Yeah, that's my friend Kevin.  Is he, uh, how's he doing?  Um, we left him last night around 10 or so.  And he's doing a lot better now.  He's still in ICU, but they think he's going to be fine.  What are his injuries?  Uh, he was shot twice in the upper thigh.  The second bullet split, I forget the exact medical term, but it split an artery. 
[01:51:30]  And, uh, so he lost a lot of blood and he blacked out the scene.  Uh, do you realize, I mean, you go to foxnews.com, you realize your friend's, uh, junk is on display  for everybody, right?  See, I hadn't realized that yet.  Uh, the first connection we had made was we could see his beard.  And that's how, uh, we first thought it was him.  Right.  Oh, that's a beard?  Yeah.  I thought he had, like, some kind of, like, a weird tourniquet or something around his  face.  I could see his mustache.  I didn't realize that that big, that's a big beard. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, he has a huge beard.  And so we thought immediately that that was probably him when we couldn't find him.  Oh, wow.  And then when we got to the hospital, we found out it was him.  Wow.  I mean, that's the picture, that's pretty much the picture that's defying this whole thing.  Defining this whole thing.  Um, whenever we couldn't find him, I was looking on the CNN front page and I saw  that picture and I just thought, wow, that's really tasteless.  And then I found out it was my friend, so.  And it's beyond tasteless because now you see what he's, uh, you see what he's packing. 
[01:52:30]  That looks like a cloth thing around his head, like he's wearing a black.  Yeah, that's a big beard.  I see it now, too.  I don't.  I still can't figure it out.  You don't see this face?  You still think it looks like cloth, right?  Yeah, no, I can't figure out anything.  It looks like his face is completely obscured.  Well, you can see his mustache.  You can see his nose, his eyes, and that.  Really?  Yeah.  And his beard.  Absolutely.  Help me out.  Well, actually, look at that picture, Ant.  That picture's easier.  Look at the picture on the website.  Mustache, nose, and those are his eyes. 
[01:53:00]  That's his mustache.  All right.  And that looks like he had that.  And he has a very, he has a very full beard that's a lot longer than the average,  the average beard, obviously, whatever.  He's wearing some kind of a garment that was hiked up over.  Yeah.  But you were with him all night.  Yep.  Is he talking?  Did he tell you what happened?  Actually, he was one of the lucky ones.  Even though his injury was pretty serious, he came into the hospital talking.  And so he's pretty low on energy, but he's told us a few things. 
[01:53:30]  What did he say to you?  He said that from what he could remember, he was in German class.  And that the Asian kid came in and started looking around, and he walked back out.  And then he came in about three minutes later and started shooting.  Wow.  Just out of nowhere, starts shooting.  And did he say what the reaction was of everybody?  If they just started running around in circles, screaming, or what was going on?  He didn't mention that too much.  He was just giving us the basics. 
[01:54:00]  By the way, Paul from Delaware, it's not as junk.  On MSNBC, the same picture, and you can clearly see it's a belt or strap.  We're not talking about the belt or strap.  A lot of news organizations have pixelated or photoshopped this kid's junk out of the photo.  The front page of the Daily News, and if you go to foxnews.com, it's very obvious that they caught the kid pretty much with his pants halfway down.  It looks like they pulled the pant leg up, and that belt thing is a tourniquet that someone put on. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that's what that – all right.  That explains – yeah, because he's – thank you, Josh.  Josh just explained it.  It's some kind of tourniquet because he was losing a lot of blood because he got a gunshot to the artery.  Yeah.  That's what that is.  It's a tourniquet to keep him from bleeding to death.  So maybe the other piece is at the other side of the belt because it looks odd to be a guy's junk.  It's just the way it's facing.  It doesn't look like a natural position.  I don't know.  That is so his junk, Jimmy.  They photoshopped it out on that, so they might have, like – 
[01:55:00]  They just don't know.  – thought it was –  There's no doubt in my mind.  Hey, Josh.  Yeah.  When he gets better, ask him.  He might not know.  What?  When he gets better, when your buddy gets better, ask him.  Okay.  Say – has he seen the picture?  Does he want to see that picture?  Oh, yeah.  I thought I was talking about that.  He was pretty embarrassed.  Was it?  Well, so you did talk about the picture and what you see in it.  He still hasn't really seen the picture yet, but we were talking to him about it, 
[01:55:30]  and he was just embarrassed that the entire nation's now seen him like that.  Right.  When is your friend getting out?  We're expecting it to be about two weeks.  Wow.  Because where the artery burst, they still haven't removed the second bullet yet.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right, Josh.  Anything else you want to add?  What was that?  My phone's –  Anything else you wanted to add?  I think that's it.  I think this speaks for itself. 
[01:56:00]  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks.  Ooh.  And that guy's credible, Steve?  That's the guy, right?  Yeah.  That was his friend?  Yeah.  Josh emailed me last night from lockdown saying I – because I knew he went to Virginia Tech.  He said, I'm okay.  They're just locked us all down in a common area.  So, yeah.  I saw it on YouTube, so it has to be true.  Yes, exactly.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Florida.  Brian.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hey, I'm looking at the cover of the Sun Sun Sunil down here in South Florida. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And that picture's on the front page, and that's definitely his junk hanging out.  Yeah.  I think –  I mean, it's clear as day, dude.  Well, the Post definitely said – the Post realized, and they photoshopped it out, but  the Daily News here in New York, front page, you can see it clear as day.  Yeah.  Go to sunsendal.com because it's on the front page of their paper, and it's a huge picture,  and it's – I mean, it's clear as day.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day.  Let's say hi to Melissa in Buffalo.  Melissa.  Hello.  Hey. 
[01:57:00]  You guys were talking about how, you know, all these news organizations are doing the fluff  pieces and everything because in light of this Virginia Tech thing.  Yeah.  I just wanted to point out that you guys are overlooking one very important thing that's  going on in your city.  What's that there, Melissa?  Your islanders are in the –  Oh, what happened to her phone?  I think she was –  What happened?  I think I heard what she was saying.  What happened?  What was she saying?  Your island –  Yeah, something like that.  What, Jimmy? 
[01:57:30]  What?  I don't know.  I didn't hear her.  All right.  Congratulations to the Sabres.  Are they winning or are they winning?  No, they're up two games to one.  You know what?  I do one more game and it's 2-2.  We're 3-1.  Depends on how you want to slice it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break now that I'm sad.  Oh, honey.  We got the Richard Gere story.  This is –  Wow, sexy.  This is an unbelievable story.  And we got the audio of the belly dancing story they had to do today.  Great.  So we'll try to get that on before we move on to the other side of the show. 
[01:58:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Ah, dare I dump it.  Oh, we still have stupid people that work around us. 
[01:58:30]  Stupid people.  Moron.  God.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Get the Richard Gere story.  Listen to this one.  This actually is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very big deal in India.  After Richard Gere stirs up some bad publicity in India, 
[01:59:00]  Gere kissed Indian actress Sylvia Shetty several times at an event to promote AIDS awareness.  The two have been ruining a safe sex campaign that's ongoing there.  India has the world's largest number of people living with HIV.  Yesterday, mobs of men burned an effigy of Gere and kicked the smoking remains in the city of Kanpur,  saying what he did goes against Indian culture. 
[01:59:30]  Lovely culture.  Yeah.  Do they realize how non-threatening that actually is?  Yeah, exactly.  Do they know anything about Richard Gere?  Although, I guess you're not allowed to show any kind of affection toward women in public or something.  Is that it?  Something like that, yeah.  That whole Bollywood thing.  Can people stop burning effigies?  That's something white people don't do.  Around the world, we don't burn.  And because the effigies are never good.  It's always like six pillows with a wig on it. 
[02:00:00]  Could they at least either, A, get someone who knows how to make an effigy look like the guy.  Or a big dopey papier-mâché thing.  It always, always looks the same.  They have a bunch of effigies, and they just tell you who it is while it's on fire.  Yeah.  They always burn their head first, so you can't see that effigy looks nothing like the person.  I want to be an effigy maker.  I want to make good effigies in the Middle East.  Effigy.  Don't say it.  You say it too much.  It sounds weird.  Effigy.  Effigy. 
[02:00:30]  Sounds like you're abbreviated.  I'm going to go effigy.  Hey, everyone's talking about the shooting, obviously.  Except for CW11 here in New York.  We kind of referred to this, but just in case you didn't believe us, this went on this morning.  While all hell broke loose yesterday, you would think they would get their crap together for today's news programs.  Oh, no.  They decided this was very important to do today.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I like that.  How about a little shake with them Moroccan fries? 
[02:01:00]  Belly dancing may just be the perfect way to satisfy both your hunger and your visual appetite.  It's truly belly-licious.  Shake off all your inhibitions, because the Lower East Side hotspot, Katra, is looking for belly dancers.  Girls with beautiful personalities, beautiful looks, girls who can shake that booty. 
[02:01:30]  Can I say that?  I know someone like that.  Am I doing it?  See, I don't have those angles.  You don't need a magic carpet for this exotic getaway, with hookahs, candles, silk furnishings, Katra,  mixes up just the right, sultry Moroccan ambiance.  From the decor to the food, to the drinks, to the dancers, it's basically like you just don't have to go to Marrakesh.  You have it here in New York City.  You shouldn't be learning this your first lesson. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, you're more advanced.  They're drinking.  Dinner and belly dance package, and you can satisfy your belly inside and out.  This is a great workout.  Working everything.  They're just ridiculous.  That was, like I said earlier, we're labeled shock jocks, and we know what the thing to do today is.  And they're doing a whole piece on belly dance, and then they go back to the studio, and they talk about a drink called the hip shaker, and back in the studio, 
[02:02:30]  oh, all the anchors are trying to belly dance.  Of course they are.  They have to be silly.  The whole nation pretty much is in mourning, if you look at the networks, and they'd rather try the belly dancing live on their news program this morning.  And to help grease up those hips, a house special drink, appropriately called the hip shaker.  I'm going to use some B2 vodka, which has caffeine and serene, so it gives you some shaking all night long. 
[02:03:00]  Here's to you.  You and to you.  And if you're scared that your jiggle may lead to some giggle, rent out your own private safe.  It's just an isolated.  You're moving, and your hips move because of that.  But you never know.  After a few lessons, you may be ready to spin into spotlights.  Katra is located in downtown Manhattan at 217 Bowery.  If you're interested in taking belly dancing lessons, or if you want to try out to become a belly dancer, 
[02:03:30]  they're holding auditions all this month.  For more, meet us on the web at GW11.com slash Julie Julie.  And now, you guys are in luck because your belly dancer outfits are still at the cleaners.  So I just wrap this arm and take it arm clean.  That's cute.  Sideways, whip the left arm around, yep.  Circle back twice.  Circle front twice.  Okay.  Are they all belly dancing now?  The chest out.  By the way, 32 dead. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Let's not forget.  Nice, guys.  Is this the whole, like...  You think you're taking your hips, but it's really your knee.  Just like that, guys.  What are they trying for here?  All right.  Up next to the hot ways and kick moving.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here's the best part, and then we'll get into it.  It's quick.  Just like that, guys.  Take it away, baby.  All right.  Up next to the sweet little puppies.  Up next to the sweet little puppies.  They're up for adoption.  We'll be right back.  Stay tuned.  You're watching the CW 11 morning news.  News?  They said morning news.  Did you say news?  I actually said the morning news. 
[02:04:30]  There are so many issues to be discussed here with this shooting.  Whether you want to talk about, you know, the gun control issue, the stupid video game  thing.  You know, there's plenty of other issues.  Security in schools.  There's just room for debate here.  There's for serious news.  And they're belly dancing and getting the whole team up to be wacky.  There should be a disclaimer that basically says, look, we're just a bunch of talking 
[02:05:00]  heads that know how to read real good.  Yeah.  We can't really think on this program, so maybe you should go to the network today.  And how?  And now they got the freaking...  Bathing beauty.  Bathing beauties.  But how do they get...  Let me ask you.  How come they have certain FCC leeway that we don't?  That is not a news show.  No, that's not a news show.  We talk about the news probably more than they do.  Oh, yeah.  They get better guests than we do.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That is not a news show.  They get...  And yet, meanwhile, they would have language freedom or somebody slipped on the air and 
[02:05:30]  dropped an F-bomb.  They wouldn't get a thing because it's a live news broadcast.  Yeah.  They have all that FCC leeway that we don't.  And it's crap.  The Geico Caveman always makes me laugh.  That should be a funny sitcom.  Hey, I love looking at hot girls like anyone else.  But today's not the day.  They said coming up, you know, the ladies...  Bathing beauties.  Bathing beauties for this summer.  Well, you could look at them, but it's not on a news program.  Yeah.  You're not on a news program. 
[02:06:00]  You go to the internet.  I don't have much more respect for a wolf in this situation room because there's a part  of me that says, well, as disgusting as this is, that's a more honest thing of what  the news is.  CW, to me, in a weird way, it's honest news.  Hi, this is what we are, asses.  We're idiots.  There's a team of writers that tells us exactly what to do.  We didn't make up this belly dance thing.  They told us to do this.  Oh, but next time we screw up, they can't wait to tell the whole world how awful we are 
[02:06:30]  as human beings and insensitive and stuff.  And they're doing belly dancing stories.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia.  Brian, what's up?  Next time we screw up.  Hey.  Yeah, I just, uh, I don't think I've heard of that or not yet, but how ridiculous is  Hillary going to see if she talks to those Rutgers girls about their hurt feelings?  Oh, sure.  Thousands of kids will probably know somebody got shot yesterday.  Yeah, Hillary's in a tough spot, that's for sure.  She'll be okay.  No, no, she'll do.  And you know what I've said to us or about us has affected our lives. 
[02:07:00]  It'll never be the same.  Yeah, great, great, great, great, great.  I got to now take a plane to Virginia.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Busy, busy, busy, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  That's the reality of it.  I mean, come on.  Who's thinking about the Rutgers women's basketball team now?  Listen to Mike and the Mad Dog.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  And I say this today to Reverend Al Sharpton.  No one's listening to you today, buddy.  Out of the news.  So long, Rev.  So long.  Were you cringing last night when this thing first happened? 
[02:07:30]  I was kind of going, oh, this turns out to be some kind of black-white thing.  Oh, is it going to be bad?  Oh, yeah.  Like, I thought it was just going to increase the racial tension.  Race stuff like that, though.  Very rarely do you see, like, a racial mass murder like that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's something that you see.  Well, Colin Ferguson on the Long Island Railroad was one of them.  You definitely see it.  But something like that, to that extent, we've never seen before.  That's why it would have been such a huge racial event if it was a white guy at a black school 
[02:08:00]  or a black guy at a predominantly white school.  And incidentally, like we said and like Patrice predicted and like we've been talking about,  one of the stations here, the one that Al Rawlings is on, I just know that because he's  my friend, is a black hip-hop station, I think.  And they're not going to play rap with certain lyrics now.  So to you dummies in hip-hop who are smashing Imus and happy to see him go down and blah,  blah, blah, and weren't defending his free speech and all that nonsense, what did you 
[02:08:30]  think was going to happen?  Now some of your music is not going to get played.  Yeah.  Good.  That's what you get.  Hey, I've got to interrupt you, Jimmy, because Taylor from Nebraska says, don't let her go  to Rome.  Why, Taylor?  Because it's just like you're going to Brazil, man.  No, it's not.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I had to tell Jimmy that today.  I'll tell you, first of all, she's not going to Rome for trannies.  Second of all, wow, did I swing and miss on that one?  I thought that one hit a lamp.  I didn't go for that.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  But no, here's the difference.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I despise you.  No, she has a friend, her best friend, who is engaged to be married.  So it's going to be kind of like a hanging with people who are responsible.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And it's not going to be like her sleeping with anybody or doing anything that she shouldn't  do.  All right.  Hey, Will the Trucker. 
[02:09:30]  Hey.  What's going on, Will?  I got a call.  I hope you out this morning.  Why?  He just said that he likes looking at girls as much as the next guy.  But just yesterday, he said if you sit there and say you like to do something, you really  don't.  Oh.  Okay.  There you go.  I hope he does like looking at girls, though.  Many times he and I have sat on the sofa under a blanket and looked at pornography together.  That was the biggest stretch of the day right there.  Yes, it was.  And for that, you get this.  This is Friday, April 20th.  The Hucky Lou.  It's the Comedy Connection in Chickpea Mass. 
[02:10:00]  First time ever there.  And two shows, 7 and 1030, 413-593-5522.  413-593.  Oh, is that awful?  What a pleasure. 
[02:10:30]  That's great.  That's what you get for your dumb observation.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  It would be all nice because when you saw him the first time, he would grab your hand, you're saying, and walk you around? 
[02:14:30]  As every chimp does when it loves a boy.  Oh, but you don't want him to come in here and just kind of look at you and, what, how do you know if he even remembers you?  Like, how do you know if a chimp knows you?  I don't know.  They might because I'm going to say this, for smell, like dogs recognize your smell, so I imagine chimps can do that, I'm guessing.  And also, I mean, they're like...  Was it just one day years ago, though?  It was a couple years ago.  It was a couple years ago for one day, yeah.  One day?  Yeah, I don't know.  He might.  He seems to think he will.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  We'll get into that a little bit, but we got the Virginia Tech president doing a press conference.  As we move forward, we're here this morning to provide you with the latest information involving the tragedy yesterday.  Captain Flincham and State Police Colonel Steve Flaherty will provide you with the latest information on the investigation,  and we'll continue to work with law enforcement agencies to notify family members of the deceased.  So as we do that, and as I know many of you will approach some of these families, 
[02:15:30]  please keep in mind the terrible tragedy that they're experiencing.  I have some additional information regarding how the Virginia Tech community will move forward  and begin recovery in the next hours and days.  First of all, Virginia Tech will cancel all classes for the remainder of the week  to allow students the time they need to grieve and seek assistance as needed.  The university will reopen administrative operations beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, April 18th. 
[02:16:00]  Understanding that some faculty and staff may wish to take additional time off this week  to cope with this tragedy and to deal with their fellow colleagues and friends.  We ask individual employees to communicate with their supervisors of their schedules for the balance of the week.  We will close Norris Hall for the remainder of the semester.  Staff are currently working to arrange alternative locations for the classrooms and for faculty offices. 
[02:16:30]  Counseling and other resources are available for students, faculty, and staff.  And students may receive counseling at McComas Hall, and counselors will be available for extended hours.  Employees may receive needed support by going to the Brush Mountain Room in the Squires Student Center throughout the day.  Now as you know, the university will be holding a convocation this afternoon at 2 p.m. in Castle Coliseum. 
[02:17:00]  This is the first time the university community will come together since this tragedy has occurred  and to share our collective sorrow.  President George Bush and First Lady Laura Bush, Governor Tim Kaine and Mrs. Kaine,  members of our Board of Visitors, members of the clergy, our stewards, and poet Nikki Giovanni  are going to share some messages of condolences to the family and friends of victims  and words of hope to all of us as we move forward. 
[02:17:30]  Again, we want to encourage all the members of the Virginia Tech community to attend  to the Coliseum before the event we hope will be brought to the table.  Did they give out any pertinent information?  Not yet.  This is 25.  I know that the Virginia Tech community and certainly the world at large  continues to struggle with these horrible events.  Get the cop on.  And we hope that some of the steps that we're taking today and in the coming days  will help that healing process.  Thank you.  That was it?  Bring the cop on.  The guy that doesn't answer anything. 
[02:18:00]  I'm Chief Wendell Flincham, the New York Police Department.  We have new information to release concerning the ongoing investigation  into Monday's face issues.  Here's what I want to hear.  State, local, and federal investigators work through tonight collecting, processing,  and analyzing evidence from within Norris Hall.  I would like to take a minute to recognize the outstanding professionalism of a fact.  Why do they do this?  Like an award show.  Again.  Since that initial 911 call came into our dispatch center.  Fucking stop it.  I wouldn't be thanking anyone. 
[02:18:30]  I also want to commend the response and dedication of those officers and investigators  with the Blacksburg Police.  What the fuck is this new trend?  State police, FBI, and ATF, along with other local jurisdictions.  B.I.  Based on their hard work, we have been able to confirm the identity of the gunman at Norris Hall.  And it is?  That person is Cho Song-hui.  Cho Song-hui.  I knew it.  I was a 23-year-old South Korean here in the U.S. as a resident alien. 
[02:19:00]  Cho was enrolled as an undergraduate student in his senior year as an English major at Virginia Tech.  Cho was in the U.S. with a residence established in Centerville, Virginia,  and was living on campus in Harper Hall.  A 9-millimeter handgun and a .22 caliber handgun were recovered from Norris Hall.  Ballistic tests on the evidence seized from Norris Hall in the West Ambler-Johnston residence hall scenes 
[02:19:30]  were conducted at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Lab in Maryland.  And?  Lab results confirmed that one of the two weapons seized in Norris Hall was used in both shootings.  All of the deceased have been transported to the medical examiner's office in Roanoke  for examination and identification.  The names of the 32 deceased students and faculty will be released once all victims are positively identified 
[02:20:00]  and next of kin are notified.  Dr. Fierro, the chief medical examiner of Virginia, will go into more detail into that in a minute.  I want to follow up on discussion from yesterday about the person of interest from the first shooting at the residence hall.  That individual was an acquaintance of the female victim that was killed at West Ambler-Johnston Hall.  He was stopped in his vehicle off campus and detained for questioning.  As officers were interviewing him, the shootings at Norris Hall were reported. 
[02:20:30]  We are still looking to him for information as the investigation continues.  We also have no information at this time to relate the on-campus bomb threats made in the last two weeks to either of yesterday's events.  Good morning.  I'm Colonel Steve Flaherty.  I'm the superintendent of Virginia State Police.  And first and foremost, I want to say to you that the men and women of the Virginia State Police, 
[02:21:00]  we have the families, the staff here at Virginia Tech,  the law enforcement agency involved in our thoughts and prayers and hope that you will as well.  This is truly, truly a cooperative effort among law enforcement at the federal, state, and local level.  And you have the agencies represented here,  not only the law enforcement medical examiner's office and staff at Virginia Tech,  but you also have agencies that are working beyond Blacksburg and other parts of the states.  We want to keep all those people in mind. 
[02:21:30]  I want you to understand that the scene that we've had to deal with,  we've had dozens and dozens of investigators, special agents from various agencies,  detectives from various agencies that have been working around the clock on a horrific crime scene.  And you all have reported that this is the most horrific incident that's occurred on a college campus in our country.  And the scene certainly bore that out. 
[02:22:00]  What went on during that incident certainly caused tremendous chaos and panic in Norris Hall.  As a result, it's greatly complicated our being able to process the scene,  if you can imagine, that at the crime scene, that the personal effects were strewn about the entire second floor at Norris Hall.  So it made it much more difficult for us to identify students and faculty members that were victims.  Victims were found in at least four classrooms as well as a stairwell. 
[02:22:30]  We know that there were a number of heroic events that took place in some faculty alike.  Within minutes of this tragedy unfolding, the gunman was discovered among several of the victims in one of the classrooms.  He had taken his own life.  Now I want to further explore just a bit this idea of additional shooters or accomplices or whatnot. 
[02:23:00]  What has just been reported to you is that the ballistics test says that one of the weapons used in Norris Hall was also used in the AJW shooting.  We have not, the evidence has not led us to where we can say with all certainty that the same shooter was involved at both instances.  So we are now exploring that evidence and trying to make that trail. 
[02:23:30]  It's certainly reasonable for us to assume that Cho was the shooter in both places,  but we don't have the evidence to take us there at this particular point in time.  We also have no evidence to indicate that there's any accomplice at either event,  but we are exploring whether or not there was someone that may or may not have helped Cho at any point  during his planning or during his execution of this particular event.  What we are doing, we are doing very carefully, very meticulously, 
[02:24:00]  because, quite frankly, we have the one chance to get it right.  So we're working very hard to make sure that the information we bring you is absolutely accurate.  Thank you.  Good morning. I'm Dr. Marcella Fiora.  Ah, she's a midget.  I serve as the Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth.  She's got a bump on her head?  First, I would like to say that our staff...  She's throwing a ball into a closet full of ghosts. 
[02:24:30]  Fucking creepy little lady.  Friends...  I can't even see her head.  ...and those who survived, those who died in the event.  Give her a boost.  They're as heartbroken as they are.  I've been asked to speak to the process of what we will be doing with the victims of this crime.  We will be working first...  You know, what's creepy is two things...  When something like this happens, I mean...  I guess because I have a girlfriend now.  The first thing you think of is, like, imagine that's your chick in a fucking classroom shot. 
[02:25:00]  Like, you said goodbye.  Like, alright, I'll talk to you later.  Just fucking gunned down.  Pretty awful.  And, uh, imagine being that guy...  That guy has roommates somewhere.  Yeah.  Who said, uh, you know, something to him that morning.  Yep.  You know, what are you doing?  Ah, nothing.  Alright.  And you go out and he's fucking shooting up, uh, rooms full of people.  Well, Asians have been stressed out at colleges lately, man. 
[02:25:30]  Asian culture stresses college a lot.  They usually hurl themselves out the windows when their grades are, you know, A-minus.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Chosung...  Chosung Hugh.  Hugh.  Someone on Instagram.  We, I thought.  Oh, is it we?  We.  So it's, uh, what?  Chosung.  Chosung We.  And then someone on Instagram feedback said,  isn't that where Jimmy is performing this weekend?  Yeah.  Chickapé, Massachusetts.  Yeah, it does sound like it.  Jesus.  Pookie Lau.  That's like an Asian version of, uh, John Wilkes Booth or Lee Harvey Oswald. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  Even he has the middle name.  But it's like when you, when you set out to do that, like, you're walking to your girlfriend.  She's done.  Let's see, uh, poltergeist lady.  Good morning.  I'm John Marshall, Secretary of Public Safety from Commonwealth of Virginia.  Governor Kaine was deeply saddened when he received the news about yesterday's tragic events.  He continues to keep the victims and their families and the students here at Virginia  attacking his thoughts and prayers. 
[02:26:30]  Yesterday afternoon, the governor declared a state of emergency, directing state agencies  to provide whatever resources and equipment that are needed to address the situation.  Are we done with this?  Yes.  Yes.  The Virginia State Police.  It's done with this.  It's been on site.  All right.  We'll monitor.  15 minutes to go.  We'll monitor the whole thing.  So, so why can't they confirm that it's, uh, one gunman yet?  Ah, that's cop talk.  That's just basic, uh, that's cop talk.  That's a technicality.  They know.  They know it's the same guy.  Just a technicality. 
[02:27:00]  They just can't say it yet.  Hey, uh, Joe Compton from Boston.  Very mad at us.  Hypocrites.  Hypocrites.  Hypocrites.  Who died and left you three?  The news police.  I tune into O&A for comedy.  I tune into O&A for comedy.  Thirty-three people die and the country cries.  How many Marines will die today?  Will you guys devote the rest of your shows to our fallen Marines?  We have commented.  I said that this morning.  We've talked about that quite a bit, uh, stupid jizz bucket.  We've commented on, on, on that a lot.  That's been an ongoing theme with the show.  We, we talk about how the news just blows off the fact that, uh, our boys and, and, and, 
[02:27:30]  and girls are dying over there.  Well, with the, uh, pretty much civil war going on, I was this morning looking at that  saying, imagine that every day.  And that's living in Iraq.  Like, yeah, that's what's going on over there.  People drive up with car bombs and boom, you know, 30, 60, a hundred people gone.  We do comment.  I mean, the, the way we do it is all of a sudden like that Anna Nicole Smith story was  massively huge.  And we're like, oh yeah, by the way, six dead today.  We do it all the time.  And, and the reason we, uh, are the, not the news police is because when this show was 
[02:28:00]  removed by the, uh, uh, from the airways, those dummies got it wrong, did what they  wanted and didn't check facts.  So there's a particular hatred of the media, which has not lessened in the two and a half  years or whatever, since the show's been back on.  Yeah.  We never forgot.  Look what they did to, uh, I miss too.  I mean, it's the hatred of the same shit, same shit.  They get one little sound bite out of context.  They don't explain, you know, ah, whatever.  And they guys know the story.  The bottom line is they will win. 
[02:28:30]  The media will always win.  You're not going to beat the media as a whole, but to know that you've made some of their  lives miserable and that one douche got fired.  I mean, there's certain things that you can't take solace in because they're awful.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bill in Charleston.  Bill, what's up?  Hello, Bill.  Guys love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you wanted to listen to this bullshit, I would turn on Fox News, NBC, ABC, or anything  else.  I want to listen to you guys for comedy.  You got to realize though, dude, one reason we're playing that is because it is a live thing 
[02:29:00]  and we're not that out of touch that we're not going to play it.  And there are people who might be driving and listening to the show, not knowing it's  on.  So kind of as a courtesy, we play it.  We have five hours a day.  Yeah.  And we don't want people just to go somewhere else for it.  If we give it to them, this is a few minutes.  Get over it.  You guys have, you say you have five hours a day.  I don't get some of these listeners ever.  30 minutes worth of walkover hiatus or whatever, 30 minutes worth of old bits and old pieces 
[02:29:30]  and everything else and probably an hour worth of commercials a day.  You don't get commercials if you listen on XM, sir.  You get bits.  And I guess you're just not satisfied with the service, so you should just cancel, I guess.  Yeah.  What do you want to tell you, dude?  I don't know what to tell you.  We play the news conference.  32 people, shut up.  32 people got shot yesterday.  We play the live news conference where they released the guy's name, and you're saying  that we should have, what, done a bit?  Like, I'm not saying that it's wrong to be funny today, but it's like we play the conference  as it happened.  We've had some comedy.  But, like, what do you want, dude?  How do you fucking win in this situation? 
[02:30:00]  And we have a chimp coming in.  We do a live show every day.  You know, there's a group of listeners out there that expect way too much from us.  We're responsible for officially six hours of programming a day.  Of course, the last hour is mostly some old bits lately from the WNEW days.  People assume, like, if we don't carry the news conference, we just have a hilarious  bit just ready to go.  Hilarious.  You know, or if we decide that we need to replay that Jenny and Vince bit, because we 
[02:30:30]  figured it was really hot yesterday and a lot of people haven't heard it, and because  we got the update on the first half of the show that it would be very smart to replay  it on the walkover.  But it was a little long, so people are bitching about that.  What do you want from us?  We can only do a certain amount of new material every day.  We're responsible for six hours a day.  An hour of that, we know we're playing bits that most of the audience has never heard.  We ruled right up until yesterday.  Right.  Now, you know, what happened?  We do the fill-in bits instead of commercials. 
[02:31:00]  We do sometimes a longer bit on the walkover to settle in or because it makes sense.  We throw in a news conference because we think that'll entertain the people a little bit  or keep them informed.  You know, what do you want from us?  All right.  We're not going to have the special moments every day.  I would love for that to be the case, but it's not going to happen.  Where's the monkey?  Who's that?  Who are you?  I just visited.  I'm the only walkover person today.  Ah.  Well, you're representing a lot of people, so you better laugh extra hard today.  Who are you? 
[02:31:30]  What's that?  Who are you?  My name's Al.  Where are you from, Al?  Al.  Al.  Where are you from?  I'm originally from here, but I've been living in Brazil the last year.  Cool.  Were you mad when Brando cut your head off in Apocalypse Now?  He looks just like chef.  I'm an associate.  I'm an associate.  The meat was gray, man.  You've heard that one before?  Uh, too many times.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  Jimmy's on it, then.  I'll hold this.  And why are you in Brazil there, Al?  Uh, my wife dragged me down there.  She Brazilian?  Is that? 
[02:32:00]  She Brazilian?  Yeah.  Nice.  Oh, Drake.  You're going to have a lip.  Yeah, they're great.  You can talk about Rio if you want.  You speak Portuguese?  Fala Português?  Eh, sim.  Uh, uh.  Foto de Braia means go back to work.  Um.  I'm a boss.  I love, uh, how is it?  Abre a boca.  Wait.  A boca?  Yeah.  Oh, the mouth.  But whenever they piss in your mouth in Brazilian point, it's, uh, it's like, uh, how do you say  open?  Uh, Abra.  Abra.  Ah, Abra Boca.  Or Abra Boca.  It's sucking so hot.  Abra Boca.  Abra Boca, baby.  Open your mouth. 
[02:32:30]  But you can just try to say that this is from Brazilian porn.  Yeah.  Yes, they could spit in your mouth.  All right, we'll go with it.  Or piss in your mouth.  Oh, no, no.  I never had a girl say that to me.  Like, I don't know what Boca means.  I'll go with it.  I'd wind up in Florida with an old Jewish lady tingling on me.  But, uh, no, I watched some Brazilian stuff.  That's fucking hot, man.  Abra Boca.  Wow.  So she dragged you down there?  Yeah.  We bought, uh, we bought a ranch.  Uh, ranch down there.  We have, like, you know, cattle and stuff.  How much was that?  Like, nothing?  Uh, $150,000 American. 
[02:33:00]  $150,000 for how much land?  Uh, 70 acres, three houses, cows, horses, all that crap.  Ah, that's hysterical.  They have satellite TV, so it's just like being in America.  Look at that.  I brought my satellite radio down with me.  It doesn't pick up in South America.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Online you can get it, though, right?  I'm sorry?  Online you can get it on a computer.  Or direct TV.  Yeah, yeah, I download it.  They probably have direct TV down there.  This is, like, the last thing on my list before I go back was to stop by here.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  What, um, what part of Brazil?  Uh, eight hours north of Rio. 
[02:33:30]  It's called Mian Juras.  It's, uh, it's cow country.  It's like Tennessee up there.  But is it like, uh, like, Iowa, when you're in Rio, man, it's dangerous.  Like, there's a lot of, you know, obviously the favelas and all that stuff.  Really bad, really bad projects.  It's really wild west out there.  It's great.  Do you have that where you are?  Like, that type of poverty?  It's, uh, it's like real farm community.  It's, it's, once you get out of the cities, it's different.  Those favelas, they're the things that ring around the, uh, the cities.  You know, all, all the rich people in the middle and on the outsides of favelas.  And they're sort of like, it's a big gang thing down there. 
[02:34:00]  It's the gangs mixed with the politics because, uh, um, well, they burn buses on you and stuff  like that if you're on the bus.  So, nice, nice place.  It's a lot of fun.  Drug dealers run fucking the cities, man.  Yeah.  Are you ever scared?  Uh, I lived in, uh, South Central.  I used to work in the South Bronx.  It's all the same.  How do you, uh, like, what, you, you just decided to leave the United States?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, uh, you know, I moved around a lot. 
[02:34:30]  I like this stuff, you know?  Wait, did you meet?  It's my wife's idea, though.  Did you meet her here or in Brazil?  Yeah.  I've been married to her for like 10 years.  I'm not here in New York.  Why did she want to go to Brazil?  Did you explain that?  Uh, we got thrown out of Hollywood.  For what?  Uh, she made, was perceived as an anti-gay remark.  And she was working in the business over there, like, uh, the music business.  And she said, and she got fired, and she got blacklisted from everything.  What was the anti-gay remark?  Uh, I don't want to reveal who the act was.  Okay.  But, like, she was doing styling. 
[02:35:00]  And one of the guys, who was an assistant, who was a gay guy, he walks up, he goes, do  you think her husband has a problem with gay people?  She goes, I don't know.  He might.  I don't know.  And she just left it at that.  The guy went back and, uh, told the star that, uh, my wife hated gay people.  And said that your husband hates gay people.  So they fired my wife and gave that guy her job.  Wow.  So, and we haven't been able to get a workout there since.  So we said, fuck this.  Let's just go find a place real cheap. 
[02:35:30]  We sold the house, made a big profit, went down there, and now I'm living like a cowboy.  It's all right.  150 grand for all that land down there, man.  They said we paid a lot.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it new or is it all, all, all property?  The place is like 300 years old.  It's like 400 years old.  But it's gorgeous?  It's, it's still in good shape?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  You can put your fist for the wall because it's like graham crackers now.  It's like, but, you know, it's pretty nice.  Is it bugs, roaches and shit?  Is that?  Is it roaches?  Roaches, all these are the problems.  We got scorpions and snakes and, uh, anteaters and monkeys and, uh, all kinds of stuff. 
[02:36:00]  You got fucking aardvarks attacking you?  Yeah.  How awful is it to be attacked by an aardvark?  Like some fat creep with a long nose fucking snipping at you.  No wonder it's so cheap.  Yeah, here.  Oh, yeah.  It's like you get eaten by bugs and shit.  I'm just so glad to be up here so I'm not being eaten.  I have, like, welts all over me from ant attacks and, uh, hornets and, uh...  Oh, hornets?  There's a lot of bees down there and shit?  There's everything down there.  It's like nuts.  It's like...  What are the ant attacks about?  Are those the dangerous ones?  They just stand on their road.  They make a road, like, miles long. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And they're like a stream.  It looks like a highway you're standing on.  And you stand out.  They go right up your leg and down your pants and up the other pants.  They go right for you, right?  They eat you the whole time.  Yeah, I've seen that on the Discovery Channel.  Yeah, yeah.  I just got the heebie-jeebies.  They go right for you, man.  Yeah.  Like the ants in America.  They might all of a sudden get on your shoe, whatever.  These things are aggressive.  No, they'll all pack up and say, like, you know, if it's, like, they don't like it's  too dry there, like, 10 trillion of them will just get up and eat their way to the next  town.  And you see it.  It's just a lot of ants going for miles, right?  Ants everywhere.  They eat everything. 
[02:37:00]  It leaves like a moonscape.  Can't you just fucking step on them?  I would fucking tap dance all over that little army.  There's so many.  Trillions of them.  Well, just run, man.  You got to pour gasoline in trenches and, like, you know, light it on fire and kill them  by the billion.  Really?  That still doesn't really do it.  Big ant holocaust.  How about if you put up a sign that says, um, ant treats and then put an arrow one  way and send them to the left.  What's my goal?  Ant treats.  Ant.  You spell it wrong.  You put, like, one of the letters backwards because that's how an ant would write.  Just don't spell it A-U-N-T. 
[02:37:30]  Jesus.  That's funny, actually.  Yeah, that's pretty interesting.  That's my Brazilian adventure.  But I came back up here because, you know, I got to have some civilization once in a while.  Have you spent any time in the, uh, what are they called?  The termos?  Is that what they're?  The what?  Oh, termos?  Termos, yeah.  No, I'm not allowed to go there.  What's that?  But I hear a lot of stories about that.  Those are, like, the Monte Carlo, the Brazilian whorehouses.  They have a thing down there called the Dupla.  A Dupla is two girls for two hours for, like, $120 American.  Yeah.  That's, like, 60 by 69.  And these girls are, like, unbelievable. 
[02:38:00]  Like, these are the girls you would never get a date with up here.  Yeah, they're smoking, man.  That's what Patrice and Jimmy and everybody else that has come back from Brazil has said.  Now, uh, I think if your wife moves you to Brazil, uh, you should be able to go to those places.  I think so, too.  But she disagrees.  Well, the thing is, I saw a girl in the Brazilian, do some of these girls dance in the, in the, in the termos.  And they make money, and you bang them for 60 American.  But if they were dancing, like, in scores or any of these plays, one little girl would brace this.  She's probably 20 years old.  I mean, literally, she could walk out with $800 American dollars a night just for dancing in this country. 
[02:38:30]  Like, she wouldn't have to fuck anybody.  Incredible.  And at 6 o'clock in the evening, you know, I was there with my family, so I really couldn't really do anything like that.  So they'd know I'm cool about it.  But at 6 o'clock, they all get off the subway.  And all of a sudden, the street is flooded with thousands of prostitutes.  And they're all beautiful.  Or they come off the beach.  Because on Rio, it's like, it's like Miami Beach.  It's a city and beach together.  And they all hang out on the beaches all day trying to pick you up. 
[02:39:00]  You know, they're getting the suntan.  They're wearing like nothing.  And then come 6 o'clock, when all those things open up, all the people get off the streets.  All, like, school children off the streets.  And all the who's and all that come, like, flooding into town.  Sorry.  I'm looking at a little chimp.  You're getting upstage by a chimp.  Look at it.  Did he get bigger?  Yes.  Mikey is adorable.  He is very cute.  Oh, my God.  We're going to have a chimp on the show in a few minutes.  Wait, let's finish up with this guy. 
[02:39:30]  And then we'll break him.  Let's sit here.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm done with him.  No, he's fine.  He wants to sit here in the end.  All right, bro.  Thank you for your stories.  Oh, look.  He wants to shake Sam's hand.  Look how cute Mikey is.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Why don't we take a break when we get back?  Oh, he wants the microphone.  It's Mikey the Chimp that worked with little Jimmy Norton.  He's a good boy.  He's shaking hands with people like a human being.  That's a little strange.  It's adorable.  All right.  We'll pet the monkey.  All right.  We'll be back.  Now good.  Onions. 
[02:40:00]  Why does my crotch smell like onions?  I don't remember eating onions.  Did I sit in onions?  Did I sit in onions?  Oh, Ian Anthony.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I get it, Danny.  I'm a monkey.  Oh, good one. 
[02:40:30]  Very good.  It's the O.P. and Anthony's show.  Mikey the Chimp is here.  And we were just playing with him outside during our little break.  He is so cute.  He's right.  Also, I didn't know Mick Fleetwood was stopping by today to help us out with the interview  with Mikey the Chimp.  O.P. had a Band-Aid on.  It was so weird.  Well, let's start from the beginning.  We go to break and the Chimp's out there and I'm thinking, all right.  It decided how to shake everybody's head.  It's got to shake everyone's head.  But what he does is he takes your hand and then smells it. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Like he'll pull it right up to his nose and he smells your hand so he kind of gets to  know you.  So he did that with everybody.  And O.P. had a Band-Aid on his hand.  So he smells his hand and then sees a Band-Aid and starts picking at the side of the Band-Aid.  And then he peels the Band-Aid off real gentle.  Very gentle.  Until your boo-boo is exposed.  Because one of the handlers goes, he notices that you have a boo-boo.  He wants to make sure you're okay.  So he then sees the boo-boo and he gently starts touching like your boo-boo, gently touches 
[02:41:30]  it.  And then he peeled the rest of the Band-Aid off.  And then later on, Steve came over and he goes to shake Steve's hand and smell his hand.  And he noticed Steve had like some kind of a boo-boo on his hand.  And he looked at it.  He touched it a little, found the Band-Aid.  He had taken off an O.P. and slaps it on Steve's hand.  It's Dr. Chimp.  And then he went in and went over some of Steve's production work and made a few corrections  on when he did. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, he's in there right now editing the whole system.  And actually, he's on a phone right now trying to get us guests for today's show because of  this Virginia Tech shoot.  Are we going to get him in?  Yeah, let's go.  Let's bring the young fella in here.  Yeah, we should bring a little.  Wait, Jimmy, so explain.  You worked with Mikey the Chimp?  Yeah, years ago, it was a pilot we did together for MTV.  It was not actually for MTV.  He was probably the same guy that directed, I think, some of Ozzy's or some of Atel's  Insomnia.  And, you know, we did one episode.  It was awful. 
[02:42:30]  Really?  It was awful.  But you liked your time with Mikey.  Oh, yeah, it was cool.  He doesn't remember me, and I didn't expect him to.  I mean, it's been too long.  It was only one day.  It wasn't like we did a movie shoot together.  But you've been talking about him off and on.  Yeah, because he's so cute.  Now you can see the whole vibe.  All right, let's bring in Mikey the Chimp.  Was it a new BJ and the Bear?  You go around getting blowjobs with a monkey?  Yes.  Me and Steve.  Here he comes.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, boy.  He needs some water.  He's thirsty.  He's drinking water.  He drinks a prima donna. 
[02:43:00]  Look at that.  He drinks...  What?  He drinks...  I don't like the way that Dan whispered that with no confidence.  That was a pretty good one.  He's got a little leash thing on.  Yes.  All right, here they come.  She said he's got the power of, like, three men.  Three men.  Yeah, he's very strong.  Look at little Mikey.  You want to sit in a chair, Mikey?  Mikey, come on up.  I like the fact that he just hops up into the chair.  All right.  There you go.  Now he's on the console.  He's hanging with Jimmy.  Yeah, he's very good boy.  Oh, is this on PalTalk?  The mirror's feeling.  It's a little... 
[02:43:30]  Mikey, you want some water?  All right.  Here you go, little fella.  Here you go.  Look at the little guy.  You want some water?  No?  All right.  No, he's out of them.  Go ahead.  Do you want to talk?  Yeah, he wants your mic, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  I'll share it with you.  Can you strap on a few extra leashes, just in case?  Oh, he's nice.  Look how cute he is.  Hey, let him run the board so the message board people can really goof on you.  Give some raspberries. 
[02:44:00]  What is he doing?  He's very sweet.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Hey, fella.  You want to give some raspberries?  He's by Jimmy.  Look.  Look.  He likes Jimmy.  He's staring right at you.  I hope that's not what he does right before he attacks.  Right before he de-eyes you.  No.  You thirsty?  I was watching some of the videos from your site.  What's the website?  It's, um...  God, I can't remember it.  It's mikeythechimp.org.  Mikeythechimp.org. 
[02:44:30]  And I was watching some of the videos of him working with, like, block puzzles and stuff.  And he's amazing.  Isn't he amazing?  Yeah.  Like, he's putting shapes in the various holes that were the same shape as the pieces that he was taking out.  He's so smart.  He has quite a bit of cognitive skills.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And then the thing with the Band-Aid was amazing.  Like, to me, that is just astounding.  He peeled off Obie's Band-Aid, saw that Steve had a little injury, and went to, you know, Dr. Mikey, put the Band-Aid on Steve. 
[02:45:00]  That was really nice.  Yeah.  It was sweet.  Is he taught things like that, or he just kind of figures out, like, when he sees a Band-Aid, he knows that there's something, a boo-boo underneath?  Yeah, he knows there's a boo-boo underneath, you know, of course, because he's had boo-boos.  Yeah.  So I put Band-Aids on him.  Really?  Yeah.  He doesn't just peel them off?  Well, yeah, he does, but I hold them on him.  How do you get the Band-Aids on with all that hair?  Look at his arms around Jimmy.  They're sharing water. 
[02:45:30]  Look, he's helping Jimmy drink.  How adorable is this?  You're killing me.  Jimmy, you better make sure you drink quick.  You're killing me.  See the shock jocks?  We're not that shocking.  Look at him.  We find it adorable.  Who doesn't have a soft spot for a chimp?  Apparently he does.  Look at him.  He's got his hand on Jimmy's head.  Now, where did you pick him up?  Like, how did you get Mikey?  We adopted him from a foundation, and also adopted his smaller brother, so we would have two of them. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I saw him on the video.  Yeah, yeah.  And it must be, because everything you hear, and it makes sense, they don't make good pets.  They're not like people can go out and get them like a dog or a cat.  So how do you keep them, and what makes you guys qualified to have Mikey, as opposed to somebody that just wants to have one as a pet?  Okay.  Well, first of all, if anyone even remotely thinks that they're pets, that would be a warning sign right there, because right now Mikey has a strength of three adult men. 
[02:46:30]  We are USDA licensed, which is through the government.  I also have a degree in animal behavior, and we first started out with monkeys and then with chimps.  They're very, very highly intelligent animals.  They have their own minds, obviously, as we can see, and they choose to do what they like to do.  So, you know, there's a lot of people that do work with chimps, and they don't quite understand their behavior. 
[02:47:00]  It is a thing where you have to know their behavior in order to be able to understand them and be able to handle them properly because of their strength and because of their independent ways.  Yeah, I guess each one is very individual as far as their personalities go.  Yes, they are.  Mikey's very outgoing.  You know, he's very energized.  His little brother is very calm, kind of likes to sit around. 
[02:47:30]  Is it hard to overcome the, like, the instinctual part of what he's all about with being pretty much domestic, I guess, because he's in a facility with you guys all the time?  But do you notice a lot of the instinctual animal instinct that comes out in him?  Oh, yeah, he still has that.  Yeah.  With food, he doesn't like to share food.  Now, he'll share food with humans, but when he goes to share food with his brother, no.  Really?  No. 
[02:48:00]  That's not permitted.  His mouth is dripping.  He's got a mouthful of water.  Spit it at Jimmy.  No, don't spit it at Jimmy.  I would laugh my ass off.  He's using that cute little chimp part of his mouth, the bottom part, to hold the water.  Look, he's helping you get your mic back up.  I know.  Even he knows that I talk off mic sometimes.  Yeah, come on.  Use the mic.  You hear, like, you remember the guy who got, like, attacked, but they weren't by his chimps.  The guy who was going to give cake to his chimp and the two adults.  Oh, that was an awful story.  Yeah.  That's not something that would happen with your own, right? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, absolutely not.  No, they were not his chimp.  That was not his chimp that attacked him.  Unfortunately, the facility didn't lock the caging, and the chimps, that's what I was referring to with the food.  That's an animal instinct.  Yeah.  The other chimps saw that they had brought cake, which is food, for the other chimp, and, you know, they obviously wanted some of that.  And, you know, male chimps have normally a problem with males, with men, because of the domination thing. 
[02:49:00]  And so when the man was there, and he brought food, you know, the other chimps, of course, that's two factors there that, you know, they weren't happy with.  If he was giving that cake up, would they have attacked him?  Yes.  If he handed it over, oh, they would have attacked him.  Is that chimp-proof?  Yeah.  Is that a chimp-proof bottle?  What do you got, buddy?  He's trying to open up Jimmy's mucinex.  Mucinex.  I saw something on the Discovery Channel about that incident and a couple of other incidents of chimps. 
[02:49:30]  They were showing how powerful they are and how awful a pet they would make.  And very smart.  They actually were conspiring with each other to use each other's strengths to open up the gates.  They figured out how to open up these gates that were holding them with their own different talents that they each had.  It was amazing.  Really amazing.  But how do you keep Mikey kind of when you have to keep him in a certain spot?  Well, he has a habitat. 
[02:50:00]  And I think it all depends on where they are also.  His habitat is very large.  It has a lot of climbing apparatuses and swinging.  He's happy to be there.  And he's happy to be there.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  And he's not in there all the time.  You know, he does come out with us and he interacts with us.  He interacts with some of the other animals that we have at home.  What other animals you got at home?  We have ten monkeys.  And then we have a baby bear.  We have some birds and one reptile. 
[02:50:30]  So, you know, he does get to interact with other species.  What's your name?  I don't even know.  Judy.  I don't know if we were officially introduced.  But Judy was telling me that their living arrangement is very unusual.  They live among the animals.  Yeah, instead of having the animal at your house, they live at the habitat.  Like, could Mikey just jump on your bed whenever he wants?  No.  No, he didn't.  So it's kind of like locked.  That would be interesting.  You're trying to sleep and just get a big chimp foot in your face.  Well, now, the chimps used to sleep with us.  They used to take turns. 
[02:51:00]  Mikey slept one night with us and then Louie slept the other night with us.  Oh, thank you.  But then Mikey would get up in the middle of the night and get into things.  He's pushing my head to the mic.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mikey apparently thinks that I should talk.  And he's actually guiding.  I've done this so many times in cars.  He's actually guiding my head onto the mic because I talked off mic.  That is so funny.  Steve, you're fired.  Mike, welcome aboard.  He's a big fan of Mike.  He's a big fan of little Jimmy.  He wants Jimmy to talk a little more.  Now he's reached out to Anthony.  All right. 
[02:51:30]  Here comes Anthony.  Oh, okay.  Oh, now he's going over to Opie.  You're going to go say hi to Opie.  He's looking at your boo-boo again.  Oh, I just have a boo-boo.  He's looking at Opie's boo-boo.  Okay, you're going to go over again.  Be careful.  Don't knock it.  Don't rip my head off.  Oh, he's very nice.  No, he's a good boy.  Don't knock anything over.  Look, he's a good boy.  He's very nice.  He won't bother you.  He's over there on Opie's side now.  He's on Opie's mic.  Mike, you want to just sit down?  Push that button.  Push these buttons.  Just showing it.  Oh, no.  He's turning mics on and off with his feet.  That's hysterical. 
[02:52:00]  He's doing good.  He's pretty mellow today.  Just watch the scissors.  He didn't turn your mic off.  I know he did.  He turned Jimmy's mic off.  I swear to God, he did.  That's hilarious.  Where are you going?  All right, he's just kind of taking a look.  He's got a little harness on.  Oh, he's typing for pal talk.  He just typed.  Oh, he wants to wash his hands.  He's banning people.  It's all right.  It's okay.  All right.  Oh, he uses the antibacterial.  No, no, no.  Don't drink.  He's drinking Purell.  He wants you to put some on his fingers.  He knows.  Like this, Mikey.  Okay?  That's Purell.  Yeah, he wants you to put some on his fingers.  No, just put some on his hands, yeah. 
[02:52:30]  There you go.  Okay, go ahead now.  No, no, no, no, like this.  Rub your hands together.  He's a clean monkey.  He's a good boy.  He's a chimp.  There you go.  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  Does it smell good now?  There you go.  Okay.  Oh, he knows about poker chips.  Uh-oh.  Mikey, look, what is that?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Poker chips.  Here he goes.  Let's bring him over here to Jimmy.  And he'll make less of a mess with him than you did.  Exactly. 
[02:53:00]  All right, he's going to bring him over to Jimmy.  Come here.  Let's bring him over here to Jimmy.  Well, he wants some water first.  All right.  He shares his water.  He's very nice.  Thank you.  There you go.  Want to play with the poker chips?  You're hysterical.  People, he's giving, he's giving Jimmy water out of his water bottle.  I hope you were thirsty, Jimmy.  People are confused.  They have to go, aren't you a germaphobe?  But not when it comes to, uh, adorable animals.  No.  There you go.  Little chimps.  He's, he's, he's, he's so damn cute.  Oh, he's very nice.  He's like relaxing, having some water.  His hair is so coarse. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, could you guys, uh, hand out the frying pans?  I want to cover up my nuts.  Why?  No.  Why, you afraid he's going to kick them?  I don't know.  Judy, if you only know.  If Judy, you only know.  Mikey.  Poker chips, Mikey.  Some poker chips.  What do you want to do with them?  How much, uh.  Say, I want to eat them, or I want to throw them.  You like to play and throw poker chips around?  Nuh-uh.  Sit down.  Please throw the poker chips.  You want him to throw the poker chips?  Oh, yeah.  We've done it many times.  Oh, okay.  Here, Mikey. 
[02:54:00]  Go ahead.  Throw them.  Whee!  Pick them up and throw them.  How do I know this is a new answer?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You want to pick them up and throw them?  Mikey.  Go ahead.  You can throw them.  There you go.  Look.  Go ahead.  Whee!  Whee!  Why'd you rile up the animal?  Yeah, get them all agitated.  That's hysterical.  Come on up, Jimmy.  Mikey.  Oh, Mike's a good boy.  All right.  He got a little too excited with the poker chips.  He got all excited.  All right.  Now he's, I don't know where he's going. 
[02:54:30]  Now he's attacking Steve.  Yeah, Mikey.  He's too excited because he has.  Good gracious.  How much water are you going to drink?  He's a thirsty guy.  His little pot belly.  He just spits them back in and didn't want it.  So you drank them back.  Don't give that to Jimmy now.  He's sitting them back in the bottle and giving it to Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  He goes, all right.  Just show me how much you really like me.  I insulted him by not drinking his backwash.  Oh, now he's drinking it up off the console.  He's a good boy.  He's having fun. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, jump, jump.  He likes the mirror.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at him go.  This thing.  Yeah, way to rile him up with the poker chips.  He was all mellow.  Yeah.  He was all mellow.  Did you like iced lattes?  We'll get him something.  He's jumping.  We have a mirror on the ceiling.  He just saw himself.  There you go.  Had to jump up and touch himself.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Mikey, clean it.  Clean it up.  All right.  He's cleaning up the water now.  There you go.  The poker chips everywhere.  Thank you, Father.  All right.  He just attacked Butcher.  All right.  Oh, he's just playing. 
[02:55:30]  Good boy.  He's just being silly goose.  Oh, hell.  There you go, Mikey.  Mikey, you want the paper?  Mikey, you want the paper?  There you go.  You want to read the newspaper?  Read the paper?  Oh, yeah.  That's a terrible, terrible thing, huh?  Yeah, that's a bad paper.  Yeah, that's a bad paper, huh?  He's actually rifling through it.  Yeah, he's looking at it.  That's more show prep than we do.  He's rolling around in the newspaper now like a nut. 
[02:56:00]  Wait, my mic is off.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my headphones are off.  You're on, bro.  He's so damn funny.  Yeah, he's just getting all riled up.  He's all eyes up at the newspaper.  Okay, come on, back up.  Is he all right?  We don't want to, like, we don't want to push him.  I've seen Mikey on some news shows.  Ah, yeah.  And it's so funny that everybody just starts doing what we are doing, laughing hysterical 
[02:56:30]  because he's just, he's so funny.  He'll stand on their news desk and just start pounding up and down.  It's called the bunny.  Is it?  Yeah.  Hey, Mikey.  Mikey.  Mikey, you want to do the bunny?  Want to do the bunny?  Come on, let's do the bunny.  Do the bunny.  Do the bunny.  Come on.  Let's do the bunny.  Come on.  Do the bunny.  There you go.  Do the bunny.  Yeah.  Jumping.  Then he just flings himself off the console.  He's so nimble.  Yeah, he just has fun.  He likes the poker tips.  He does.  He likes to have fun. 
[02:57:00]  You know what?  You can see the straightness.  Oh, he's a problem.  Believe me.  He's a major problem.  Yeah.  He's going to talk.  So did you guys see the video with the Bill Filmes?  I heard someone talking about it earlier.  Yeah.  The poker video?  Yeah, the poker video.  Oh, yeah, with the poker video.  It was hysterical.  He was very, very calm, Mikey.  Yeah.  Considering the fact of how much he was getting screamed at.  That guy was just yelling.  Wasn't he yelling?  He was trying to get Mikey crazy, though. 
[02:57:30]  I think that's why he was yelling, to try to get him nuts for him.  Yeah, Mikey's trying to open up a CD cover now.  Mikey started throwing the poker chips at the dealer.  I was laughing my ass off.  It was so funny.  Check, check, check.  Turn this on.  We'll give him his own mic.  Yeah, you're talking to him.  Mikey, you want to talk into the mic?  Mikey.  Mikey's talking to the mic.  Oh, boy.  All he likes is raisins, does he?  No raisins.  No raisins.  That's not part of his diet, I guess.  There you go.  You can have your own mic.  There you go.  You can talk.  Talk.  Here, hold it up.  There you go.  Now talk into it.  Blow him a raspberry. 
[02:58:00]  Now blow him a raspberry.  I'm looking at it.  Mikey.  Blow him a raspberry, honey.  Him just doing that noise is more than we normally do on the XM side.  Oh, my God.  How many jokes do you have in your head right now that you can't tell?  I know.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  No, right here, honey.  No, I'm a kid.  Little knuckles.  He's a little, like, human hands.  Mikey for third mic.  A lot of people are asking, if he has the strength of three men, what do you do when he does get out of control? 
[02:58:30]  Is there a way to, like, calm him down right away?  Well, because I know his behavior so well, I don't allow him or I don't let him get to that point of getting out of control.  And I see Daddy over there give him some hand signals every so often if he gets, like...  Yeah, we do hand signals.  A little rambunctious.  Yeah.  And how do you communicate with the hand signals for the most part?  Um, no, actually, just speaking to him.  Does he understand English or he just understands...  He understands probably 99% of what we say. 
[02:59:00]  That is something.  What are considered aggressive acts?  Like, I remember years ago you told me you don't smile at him with your teeth because that's, like, an aggressive thing for a chimp.  Or, like, what don't you do that people would normally do that you think would be fun and he'd think that was a...  Well, like, when he's being sympathetic, I noticed out there, Opie, when you had a boo-boo and Mikey was being sympathetic to you, someone had laughed at him.  And he turned around and just the look on his face was like, you know, don't laugh at me.  Don't mess with me.  Yeah, he doesn't like to be laughed at when he's being sympathetic towards someone. 
[02:59:30]  Really?  Because he is.  He's very sympathetic.  Some of the other things, he does not care for children and most chimpanzees don't care for children.  How do you not love that?  They're very loud.  They move around very quickly.  I love this.  How do you not love the fact that he doesn't like kids?  Good boy.  Hey, can we do...  Good boy.  I love him.  Can we do monkey cam?  Where's the...  Well, there's a cam, right?  Is he on?  He won't throw our camera, will he?  He might.  No.  All right, give him the camera for a minute.  This is monkey cam.  Monkey cam with Mikey the chimp. 
[03:00:00]  Mikey.  Hold on it.  Does that one work?  No, Mikey, over there.  Here, buddy.  Here.  Oh, my God.  Here.  Oh.  He's going to...  Oh, you mean giving him, like, the real $2,000 camera to hold for, like, a minute?  It's not going to hurt it.  I'm going to...  Okay.  Mikey, take the camera.  All right, we'll put monkey cam on our website later today.  Here's Mikey the chimp.  Okay, here you go, buddy.  Working the camera.  Look.  Mommy, I want you to hold it like this.  Okay?  And then hold this here.  Hold it.  Can you hold it?  My camera. 
[03:00:30]  Okay, now look in there.  Oh, look.  Okay, hold it.  Hold it.  Now look through there.  He's looking through the camera.  He's eating the viewfinder.  Look in there.  Look.  See Jimmy?  Oh.  I like how he just...  No, you don't kiss Jimmy.  He eats the viewfinder.  He's trying to kiss Jimmy through the camera.  Aw.  Because he saw Jimmy in the middle of the...  Here, here, here.  A little kiss for everyone.  All right, maybe he doesn't want it.  That's okay.  Hold it.  All right, we're trying to get it here.  Here.  Hold on to it.  Monkey cam with Mikey the chimp.  You got it?  You got it?  I'll do it like this. 
[03:01:00]  See, he looks through it.  You can't see anything, though, through this.  How do you...  Shut the screen.  Well, give him the...  Jesus.  Give him the screen.  Jimmy can't even use it.  There you go.  There you go.  Here you go.  Go ahead.  Hold on to it.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  How do you just show him how to do it?  Good evening.  He's looking through the viewfinder, and he sees Jimmy.  That's so funny.  He doesn't know how to squint, though.  That's too weird.  It's freaking out.  He's got to jump now, Mark.  That's freaking him out. 
[03:01:30]  It's too weird.  I see him through the lens.  He's not happy about that.  I know.  He rolls around on his back and grabs his feet and just goes wild.  What?  He can't comprehend that?  What's this...  What is he doing?  He's like Kubrick.  He didn't like the angle.  Yeah, how would you like it?  Yeah.  He's being goofy.  Like some kind of wacky technology.  Yeah, he's trying to just mind his business.  He sees me, and he touches...  Hey, I got scissors.  No.  Give scissors.  Give him the camera.  Give him the instigator.  What happened?  Instigator.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Pick up those chips and throw them at OB. 
[03:02:00]  Go ahead.  I would love that.  So is this...  Good evening.  Here, look.  Is this funded, or is this out of your own pocket, like your studies that you do?  I don't know how to my own pocket.  It's all out of your own.  Wow.  Here, look.  Mikey, don't eat those.  Throw them at him.  Throw them at him.  Go ahead.  Go.  Here, take them.  Throw them at him.  Go ahead.  Here, I'll show you, Mikey.  There you go.  Throw them at him.  Just throw them at him.  He tumbled off the console. 
[03:02:30]  Sit down.  Mikey.  Thank you.  Mikey.  Have some chips?  Go.  Go.  Go.  Oh.  Oh, he's great.  Not the big thing.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Go.  Go.  Go.  He's just kicking them and throwing them.  He's like, I didn't really mean to you.  But now he's.  Oh, Lord.  I love you.  Oh, you're adorable.  Look how cute. 
[03:03:00]  He really want to throw them.  He's just going and hugging Opie now.  Yeah.  He feels bad.  He's looking worried about your cut.  He's worried about your brudel.  It's okay.  He's.  He's.  Oh, poor man.  He really is sympathetic.  Yeah, he's nice.  He's amazing.  All right.  He's real matchy.  Anyone over there?  He said, I didn't really want to.  We're getting plenty of video of Mikey.  He's a very nice little fella.  What else could we get Mikey to do?  Do you ever have to give him a haircut?  No, that's the way their hair grows. 
[03:03:30]  That's how their hair grows.  Yep.  Yep.  That's great.  Sort of like a Michael Jackson cut.  Mikey.  He's there.  It's like a kid.  You keep thinking he's going to fall off and hurt himself.  No, he's not.  I know.  Absolutely.  Because he'll roll off on his back.  Yeah.  He's very, very strong.  He has a very hard, like, back.  It's like, it's all bone and muscle.  Look at the definition in his shoulders and his triceps.  He's so strong, you know.  Well, you figure he can hang from his habitat from one finger. 
[03:04:00]  No kidding.  And hold his entire body up.  Yes.  Wow.  How old is he now?  He's five.  Okay.  How old was he?  I guess he was like two in this one.  He is bigger, too.  How much does he weigh?  He's 52 pounds now?  56 pounds.  56 pounds.  Yeah.  And he's going to get up to five feet, you were telling me?  Five feet tall?  Five feet.  Yeah.  Five feet.  He could be up to 200 pounds.  Does anybody have any questions?  And he won't, like, he'll always listen to you, though, because he'll see you as both, 
[03:04:30]  like, mom and dad.  Yeah.  Mom and dad.  Yep.  But they always are respectful.  They don't, like, overtake, like most shitty human teenagers do.  Don't even start on that.  Yeah, don't start on that.  We have three of them.  Now we wish that we had stayed with the chimps.  What?  He's like, I know.  That just cracks me up when he goes like that.  He just likes to jump around.  He does.  So funny. 
[03:05:00]  Now he's back on Jimmy's mic.  He's making noises into Jimmy's mic.  Can you give kisses?  There you go, Mikey.  There you go, Mikey.  There's another piece, please.  Read the paper, bro.  Read the paper.  He really enjoys just ripping up.  And that's what you should do with the post.  There's water everywhere.  There's something I'm sure he'd like to do on the post, but he's wearing pants.  That's what I like to do with the post.  Yeah, I just got to put these, uh...  Yeah, it's all right.  Oh, Mikey. 
[03:05:30]  He's just being a chimp.  And you haven't, uh, you know, given him a handshake or anything lately.  I'm shaking his little hand.  Why don't you shake his hand?  What's the matter, you?  Here, can I have that?  Thank you.  Hi, Mikey.  Hi, Mikey.  Oh, good boy.  You're going to go give him a kiss.  He's a good boy.  Where are you going?  Ed's going to get one of these.  No.  This is perfect for you.  Hi, Mikey.  He's adorable.  Yeah, he really is.  Little guy.  He really wants to talk to that mic.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I've seen shows where, like, they get really close to almost communicating like a human  being with, uh...  With the hand...  With the, uh...  American Sign Language?  Yeah, Sign Language.  Well, Mikey does, um, I tried to teach him American Sign Language when he was younger,  but there's just ways...  He jokes on fan.  Nobody's allowed to leave the room.  Yeah, whoever leaves the studio gets jumped on, so...  That's right.  Um, but the hand, the finger signals are just too much for, for teaching, I think. 
[03:06:30]  So, Mikey has learned, uh, hand signals for our family.  Oh.  What do you got there?  There's a little sniff, and now another microphone.  I'm going to give it a kiss.  Now.  Oh, that one's for me?  Talking to this one.  Oh.  Hey there, Mikey.  Hey there, Mikey.  Hey there, Mikey.  Hey there, Mikey.  That one works?  There we go.  That's better. 
[03:07:00]  What's it?  You want to talk?  Wouldn't it be funny if he did speak, and he said, stop doing the filler?  You want to talk?  What's up with the water?  Where you going?  Watch out for the water.  Whoa.  He's out on the ground again.  This is hysterical.  Mikey.  Mikey.  More water, buddy.  Mikey.  Here you go.  More poker chips.  There you go.  Good boy.  There you go.  How come you put his pants on backwards so he doesn't start fumbling?  Because he takes them off.  Mikey.  He takes them off. 
[03:07:30]  Mikey.  He'll put your pants on backwards, Jim.  That's the secret.  He's wiping his...  I gave him a tissue.  He wiped his mouth and his nose with it.  He knew exactly what to do.  Yeah, he's smart.  Watch, watch, watch.  There you go.  Like that, Mikey.  Watch.  I hope he's going to demonstrate.  Perhaps more than that.  All right, now you wipe your face.  No, or drink the water.  He'll be peeing the whole ride back. 
[03:08:00]  Want me to take that?  Want to give it to him?  Yeah, what does he wear?  Wear a little diaper under there?  Yeah, he has a pull-up one.  He's a big chimp now.  Does he...  Yeah, he's a big chimp now.  That was cute.  How often does he need a change in?  I don't know, six, seven times a day.  Really?  Except for when he's outside.  You know, when he's outside, he doesn't need a diaper.  Yeah.  Speaking of outside, that's what we're working on now, his outside habitats. 
[03:08:30]  For both him and his brother.  And...  How much property do you have?  We have five acres at our facility.  Five acres?  And there's a...  I heard someone say that they were on the website.  Yeah, I went on the website and took a look around.  Did you get a chance to see the Prima Dome?  No.  That's the habitat that we're working on building for them.  So it's going to be real nice for them out in the yard. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, so that'll be outside, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, great.  Because they don't...  Right now, all they have is an inside habitat.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I see you take them for walks outside and stuff.  Yeah, we take them for walks, and we put them on...  ...and play in the yard out back, because we have an eight-foot fence.  Uh, but what we really would like is the outside habitat.  Do you have neighbors?  Jimmy's not allowed to talk anymore?  Yeah, I guess he was, uh...  Mikey, give Jimmy...  He's eating the raisins.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Well, I hope no one really wanted those raisins for lunch. 
[03:09:30]  Well, that's okay, yeah.  Here, Mikey, let's give Jimmy back his microphone.  He likes those raisins.  By the way, what are we promoting today?  So you guys, uh...  I mean, you obviously do this to kind of get some kind of message out there, no?  Or...  Um...  We're not really.  Or is he doing something that...  Yeah, the mic should work.  Your mic should work.  Where's the one sheet on Mikey?  But Mike's working, isn't he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You are.  Okay.  Oh, whisper.  What?  Whisper.  Write it down.  Okay.  She wanted...  Have Mikey tell us, Opie. 
[03:10:00]  Uh, she wanted to ask me something, but she's going to write it down.  Okay, thank you.  Sorry, but it was so obvious I had to...  We'll just play with Mikey.  Yeah, yeah.  He's really sucking those raisins down.  Yeah, yeah.  He likes those raisins.  I've never been a big raisin fan.  Well, Mikey is.  That's all that matters.  Can I, uh...  Who gets to clean the diapers?  That's got to be just horrific.  Let's be honest.  I don't do.  You do?  Come on.  My husband.  Be honest.  At first, it was probably, oh my God, and you got used to it, right?  Well, no, because it's not even hard.  It's always mushy.  And then time, it's green. 
[03:10:30]  That embarrasses him.  Yeah, he just got embarrassed by it.  I was talking about it.  Oh, yeah.  Look, he's embarrassed.  I love how he puts the raisins all in that front chimp lip.  Yeah.  That bottom chimp lip.  Like he's chewing.  Yeah, like he's got some tabacky in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His little ribs.  They're feeling his ribs.  He's laying down on his side now as Jimmy scratches his armpit.  Everyone likes being scratched.  You know, Jimmy and Z's get B.O. too.  Do they?  Under their armpit?  Yes, they do. 
[03:11:00]  Really?  If he goes outside and plays, he sweats, and then he gets B.O.  A little stinky.  All right, here's the communique I got.  Oh, you're going to read it out loud.  No.  Hey, you're just like anyone else in here.  It's okay.  We love you.  Can I talk about Poker Share and how they ripped us off?  Yeah.  What's that about?  Yeah, of course.  I can.  Of course you can.  Wait, I don't even understand.  What happened?  Well, Poker Share is a company that hired us.  Is that Doody or Raisins on the console? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, it's Doody.  Why?  You want a piece?  I just got to tell you it's green and it's mushy.  I was just making sure.  All right.  So, yeah, what's that about?  Tip Doody.  Poker Share is a company that hired us to go around the country with Mikey and play poker.  Sure.  And then they hired us.  They hired us to play in the World Series of Poker, Mikey.  So, they paid for his entry of $10,000 to play poker against all the other poker players. 
[03:12:00]  So, I spent months and months and months teaching him how to play poker.  Texas sold him.  Does he kind of know how to play, by the way?  He kind of does, but I had a script that I was told to say to all the media.  And, I mean, I was on all sorts of shows.  Sure.  And I had to stick to the script, which was written by Poker Share.  And didn't the animal rights activists give you guys crap because you're playing poker?  Oh, my God, yes.  And we are still living. 
[03:12:30]  We are.  I mean, we're still on PETA's website.  Wow.  Yes, for Mikey playing poker.  Animal rights does not agree with using great apes in entertainment.  Now, I agree with them, and then I don't.  I do agree with them because there are a lot of great apes that are being abused in the entertainment business.  However, obviously, you can tell that Mikey is not abused at all.  Tip-tuff.  But, anyway, so they drug Mikey and I all around the United States doing all these things. 
[03:13:00]  And then we went to Vegas.  And the night before we were supposed to be doing the World Series, a newspaper gentleman came up to me.  And he said, you know, they're not going to let Mikey play.  And I said, why not?  And he said, well, because he's not 21, and it doesn't have anything to do with that he's an animal.  It's just that he's not 21 years of age.  Didn't anybody tell you this?  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, no, they didn't. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, Poker Share really made me believe that he was going to be able to play and that I was going to be able to sit next to him.  So I learned how to play.  So what I did is I taught Mikey how to pick up cards, lay them down, push his chips.  I was going to make the decision as to when he was going to bet and when he wasn't.  So during the big press conference that we had the night before, they had $10,000 worth of cash laying on the table.  And one of the newspaper people asked us, asked one of the representatives at Poker Share, if Mikey isn't allowed to play, will you donate the $10,000 of his entry money to Mikey? 
[03:14:00]  And they said, absolutely.  Also, they made an agreement with me that they would do two things for Mikey if I allowed Mikey to do this, one of which was that they would donate enough money for his habitat.  The habitat is the Prima Dome, which is $60,000.  That was one of the stipulations why we did this. 
[03:14:30]  The second was that they would put a donation button up on their site so that that way anyone that was gambling on their site could take some of their winnings and donate Mikey some money.  So we went out and we got a 501c3, a nonprofit, just so that, you know, the bettors on Poker Share could do that for us.  Well, they have not put a button up.  They've not given us any donation money towards the Prima Dome and the $10,000 entry form money. 
[03:15:00]  Well, we don't know where that is either.  And they also have a blog up on the Internet that's called Mikey's Blog, which they have no permission to do.  And they've used Mikey's images on two websites.  Now, I have animal rights that is all over me about, you know, what I've done to Mikey by bringing him around and, you know, exploiting him. 
[03:15:30]  And the only reason why I did it is because here I thought, you know, they were going to donate $60,000 towards his habitat.  And now we've ended up with nothing, and they're still using his image.  And we've contacted Poker Share several times, and, you know, they keep saying, yes, yes, yes, we're going to put the button up for you.  We never promised you any money, blah, blah, blah.  And still, even since last September, we still have not seen anything.  So why did they back out? 
[03:16:00]  Do you think it's because they couldn't get him to play poker?  That's why they had to back out?  No, it's because President Bush passed the bill of no more online gambling.  So they didn't have a use for Mikey anymore.  In the U.S.  In the U.S.?  Yep.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I've just been looking at him the whole time.  If you kiss him, is that bad?  Oh, no.  I don't want to just put my face by him.  Oh, no.  He loves to be kissed. 
[03:16:30]  Okay.  Give Jimmy a kiss.  Mikey, give Jimmy a kiss.  Jimmy, don't slip him the tongue.  Mikey, give him a kiss.  Only if he wants to.  Give him a kiss.  Only if he wants to.  No, Jimmy a kiss.  Give him a kiss.  He's shy.  No, he's not.  He doesn't have to.  It's a little weird to kiss another man in front of a couple of men.  I don't blame him.  He doesn't like kids and he doesn't want to kiss men.  How do you not like Mikey?  You're used to touching a hairy back and give him a little kiss.  He's no fruit.  He's a very sweet little chimp.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  He's a good boy.  Well, is there anything like a website or anything that you want to promote that people can donate or anything? 
[03:17:00]  Um, www.mikeythechimp.org.  Okay.  And that is our non-prof.  And, uh, uh, we're working on his outside Prima Dome, which, you know, now we have to do it on our own because, you know, the people that had promised us that they would help us are not helping us now.  Is there something on the website that you can donate or, uh, yeah?  Yeah, there's a donation button on there.  I think it's cool because it, like, it does, some people would say it's bad, you know, you're using him for entertainment. 
[03:17:30]  But just to take him around and show people, uh, what, what he's all about and stuff kind of makes you, you know, sympathetic toward the animals.  And appreciate the species.  Yeah, and want to, uh, you know, have him around a little longer.  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's really cool.  Got a question coming in from Dean from Indiana.  Does, uh, Mikey have a sense of humor?  Like, what does he find funny?  And how do you know he's finding something funny?  Lucky Louie.  Believe it or not, that's really a good question because Mikey does have a sense of humor. 
[03:18:00]  Chimpanzees do laugh out loud, which probably 99% of the population does not know that.  Um, he likes to watch movies and when he does and he finds something funny on a movie, he does laugh out loud.  Yeah.  Um, when we tickle him, he laughs out loud.  Um, so if the gentleman would like to hear him laugh, I can certainly do that for him.  Absolutely.  What did he find funny?  What was the last movie he found funny?  Or the last movie scene?  Um.  Or the last TV show?  Oh yeah, The Animal.  He loved The Animal?  He loves The Animal. 
[03:18:30]  He's like everybody else.  He just loves films about himself.  You know what part he liked?  He liked it when he went into the water and he was pretending like he was a, um, a dolphin.  Who did that movie again?  Rush Nighter.  Rush Nighter.  Number one with chimpanzees.  Rush Nighter.  That's fantastic.  Rush Nighter finally found his audience.  He made $50 and $2 million bananas at the box office.  Hey Mikey.  Mikey.  Here.  Let mommy help us.  We're going to tickle Mikey. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, we're going to tickle Mikey.  Show mommy where you want me to tickle you.  Someone could lose their testicles any moment.  Show me.  Show me.  Right there.  Right there.  Greg, I may need you to help me.  I had that microphone and wires.  I'm going to tickle.  I'm going to tickle.  Now stop him.  We're asking where. 
[03:19:30]  Where do you want to tickle?  Where to tickle?  Oh, not down the path.  Oh no.  Oh no.  Poor Mikey.  He's having a ball.  He is.  Look at the big smile.  He's got good teeth.  Thank you.  He brushes them all by himself.  Does he brush his teeth? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, he does.  Wow.  Good boy.  Get E-Rock in here.  Show him.  He's got a red nail.  I'm kidding.  Shut up.  Okay, come on.  He's like, oh, I wanted to be tickled a little bit.  So that's Mikey's laugh.  And he does laugh when he watches something.  Now, Greg's a big boy over there.  Can you control him if you had to, if you went completely out of control?  Maybe to a point.  Maybe to a point.  Wow.  I guess the trick is to not, you know, have him out of control.  Right.  When I worked with him, he was getting all antsy during the day. 
[03:20:30]  He was running around the cafeteria, which was such a gigantic room.  I remember you guys were trying to chase him, but it was so hard to get a hold of him.  Get running at the corners.  He was being so bad.  He was being bad that day.  I was so happy.  He was happy.  He hated that stupid script as much as I did.  And then they wanted him to stick a fork in his ear, and I'm like, what is up with that?  Oh, to eat.  That's right.  Yeah.  You know what?  Unfortunately for you guys, people would love just seeing him run around like a lunatic  because it's funny and entertaining to watch, but you guys have to go home with him. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  But for everybody else, it's just, ah, look at him climb the walls and do whatever you want.  And we have to worry about what he's going to break and what he's going to get into and,  you know.  Did he ever eat anything that was, like, really bad, like, dangerous that he shouldn't have  eaten?  No.  You know what?  Chimpanzees are very intelligent when it comes to eating things.  They know that if it's not food, they're not going to eat it.  So they're not like...  They're not like children at all.  They're not going to eat chips or whatever.  Like public chips, you wouldn't eat them.  No.  No.  Absolutely.  Put him in his mouth a little bit.  If it's not food, he's not going to eat it. 
[03:21:30]  Very good.  Just looks like he's going to tumble on his head.  All right.  That's great.  Probably take a break.  Yeah.  Take a little break.  And the website again?  www.mikeythechimp.org.  There you go.  And you can check him out.  We have videos on there of him learning things, their habitat, and...  Sam's scared of him.  The photos.  Why are you so scared of Mikey, Sam?  Sam, he's tired of you already. 
[03:22:00]  Come here.  I don't blame Mikey.  He's had enough of Sam.  Hey, Mikey.  Sam has candy in his head.  He does.  He does.  You have candy in your head.  Oh, Mikey.  Look at his head.  Tell me he doesn't have candy somewhere in that skull.  Look at his rosy cheeks.  His rosy cheeks.  The fitness just wants to come out.  Yeah.  Yes.  And look at his hair.  He doesn't think he's human.  He's got like some type of...  I don't know what that is.  I apologize ahead of time, but this has come in a bunch of times.  Does Mikey, you know, with himself? 
[03:22:30]  No.  Like our audience does.  No.  Like our audience.  Oh, look.  Mike.  He's giving Jimmy kisses.  He kisses Jimmy.  How adorable.  Oh.  What a good boy.  Because he banged me with his elbow, so he felt kind of bad.  Oh.  An accident.  Yeah.  Pop up an accident.  No, he doesn't do that.  He's fixed number one.  Oh.  He's missing out.  Come on.  Yeah.  I think they...  He's missing out.  I didn't think they did that with the chimps.  Yeah, they do. 
[03:23:00]  Fix them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have no intention of...  Oh, look.  It spins.  Oh, he's getting all rambunctious.  What?  He said enough of you.  What do you want?  He pulled your mic down like, let me be the star.  Here, Mikey, give this to Jimmy.  Oh, look at that belly.  Give this to Jimmy.  Give that to Jimmy.  I just want to even look at him.  No, give it to Jimmy.  He doesn't know what to do with it.  You're going to stick out your tongue.  You're naughty.  He really is.  He is.  Get a poker chip in there.  Can people take him off half on?  Yes. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  All righty.  We want to thank these guys for coming by.  Absolutely.  Thanks for coming down.  Thank you very much for having us.  He's so adorable.  MikeyTheChimp.org.  There he goes.  MikeyTheChimp.org.  Mikey, thank you.  Thank you, Mikey.  Thank you, Mikey.  You're a good boy.  Mikey, go.  Ooh.  Good boy.  Ooh.  Come on.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  No, you're not going to tell him?  Not in the mood, huh?  No?  No.  Oh, he wants to jump on sand. 
[03:24:00]  There he goes.  He's flipping upside down.  He's really tall.  He looked at sand like he's a tree.  He thinks sand's a tree.  Look at him climbing up on sand.  Let him climb up on you.  We got video of all this, so it's really hysterical.  This will be on the safe.  Yeah.  Climbing up big, dumb sand.  Good for him.  He's like, you know.  Wow.  He's jumping up there.  That's so funny.  He's looking at him like, you don't do nothing.  Just going to climb up you.  Good boy.  Let me get this guy going. 
[03:24:30]  He wants to flip over backwards.  That's holding him by his feet.  Hello.  Be careful now.  Everybody's as strong as you.  Enjoying using you as a jungle gym.  You don't drop him.  Then he comes over to Jimmy for loving.  Yeah, he does.  He just looks like a big, dumb fan of the tree.  And when he needs real chimp contact, he hugs his friend.  He knows who the big, dumb tree retard is.  All right, he's opening the door. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Hey, honey.  Hold on before you.  Okay.  Gotcha.  I'm going to clean up his mess.  All right.  We got interns.  Mikey's done.  He's holding the door.  He's opening it.  Go ahead, Mikey.  Open the door.  Blow him a kiss.  Blow him a kiss.  Blow him a kiss.  Blow him a kiss.  Blow him a big kiss.  Big kiss.  Come on.  Big kiss.  He's blowing kisses.  Blow him a kiss.  Give him a raspberry.  It's raspberry.  What do you want to say?  Raspberry. 
[03:25:30]  Now, show him your tongue.  Show him your tongue.  Show him your tongue.  Show him your tongue.  Tongue.  Tongue.  Tongue.  You can do that.  Hey, buddy.  Raspberry.  He's just kind of looking at the camera.  Come on, raspberry.  Come on, raspberry.  Squeeze.  All right.  He's kissed the mic.  All right.  That's funny.  The mic gets a kiss and the fan just jumped on.  Tongue.  Tongue.  Tongue.  Tongue.  Tongue.  Good boy.  Wiggling his tongue around.  Looks like he has good technique.  All right. 
[03:26:00]  We've got to take a break.  I want to thank Judy, right?  Judy.  And is that your husband?  Yeah, that was Greg.  That's Greg.  He's a cool dude.  And Mikey the Chimp, of course.  Mikey.  What a mess this place is.  Are you sure?  Oh, no.  Don't worry about it.  We've got people.  We've got people that are much dumber than a chimpanzee.  Yeah.  We're not listening.  We'll be right back.  We're even more or less important than the chimp.  Yeah.  All right.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you?  Find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off. 
[03:26:30]  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  That virus you're always talking about.  El Vido se Opie and Anthony.  All right.  That was very...  Glad we were able to get our jokes in.  Yeah.  I had to go out and see him because as he's leaving away, he's making kiss things.  I got to go out and give him a kiss.  He adores Jimmy.  I thought it was going to be like Jimmy was going to be disappointed that Mikey didn't 
[03:27:00]  remember him.  But after a little while, Mikey did nothing but want to give Jimmy kisses.  Yeah.  I didn't think he would either.  I was like, I was going to text my girlfriend.  He's ignoring me.  You'd love this.  He wanted no part of me.  I felt like a fat chick out there trying to talk to the chimp.  And then, yeah, something clicked there and he was giving you hugs and kissing Jimmy on  the lips.  Yeah.  They were lip kissing.  I'm going to go home and kiss my girlfriend without brushing.  And then I'm going to take my hand, which I won't wash, and cup her face and let her  smell the animal. 
[03:27:30]  Smell chimp on you.  What you were hanging out with.  Absolutely.  Chimp.  We all got pictures taken.  Now you know what I got to deal with.  We all got pictures taken and I thought Sam was the most scared, but it turns out Travis  more scared of little Mikey than Sam.  Why are you scared?  I don't know why everybody's saying I'm scared.  I wasn't scared of Mikey at all.  Did you see that?  Look, we have photographic evidence.  And by the way, I was taking video on my camera that I will pop up there.  You are like stiff and your arms are away. 
[03:28:00]  You wouldn't put your arms around little Mikey.  Did I put my arms around Mikey?  You did.  You were petrified.  Why don't you just make believe it's that big hat, hat, that big cat in your homo picture.  Oh, fuck.  I said hat.  Look, damn it.  My good insult.  Look, we learned Mikey the Chip has the strength of three men.  At least we would last ten seconds, okay?  That's what Travis was thinking.  Not even a second.  Travis was like, well, how many is that in women?  Oh, oh, that'll hurt.  Oh, boy.  Hey, let's get line of the day out of the way. 
[03:28:30]  Mikey got it.  He went...  He likes to be tickled.  He can't help himself.  He really did like being tickled.  He wasn't.  We got a runner-up line of the day.  Sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Mixed martial arts action.  Bodogfight.com.  Here's a...  Sam was only half scared.  Oh, shit.  That is...  When you said...  Oh, never mind.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, they had a conversation about dinner and what they were going to have, and she was 
[03:29:00]  talking about, like, yeah, I'm feeling better, and as she's saying all this, you could hear  when certain things were happening because she wasn't able to carry on a normal conversation  without, like, certain barking sounds coming out.  Her voice changed.  Her voice would change during certain moments.  It sounded something like somebody was rapidly punching stew.  I want to laugh so hard that I really hurt.  Punching stew.  I got to do that just to hear what it sounds like now, right? 
[03:29:30]  We obviously...  We don't even need to listen to the line of the day.  We know what it was.  It's obvious.  Oh?  It's your joke.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  It's funny.  Bodogfight.com.  Here is your line of the day.  You know the third one that I did on the course.  Sorry.  Here comes the line of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day. 
[03:30:00]  Wow.  Does he brush his teeth?  Yeah, he does.  Wow.  Good boy.  Good E-Rock in here.  Show him.  Yeah, show him.  Yeah, show him.  Yeah, show him.  Yeah, show him.  Yeah, show him.  Yeah, show him.  I stuck with the formula I know that works for winning line of the day.  All you got to do is goof on E-Rock and the boys will pick you. 
[03:30:30]  Am I the only one going through, like, chimp withdrawal?  Oh, I feel bad now.  I know.  Like, I just want to play with him.  You want to just hug him.  My arms feel empty.  Oh, Jimmy.  What's your thing?  You're going to have to sell for a girl.  I want duty chimp, Mikey.  Duty diapered.  Duty diapered Mikey.  Imagine, like Ope said, having to change that.  Must have been like, oh.  I've watched him do it once.  He's got a little foot up on the wall.  It's so arrogant.  He just pops his foot up like, go ahead, dummy.  Change me.  Change me, human. 
[03:31:00]  Who's dumb now?  So it's MikeyTheChimp.org.  And that's when you realize it's not adorable to own a chimp.  No.  And you have to clean up that.  You're cleaning that up.  He's really sweet, though.  He's so cute.  I got great pictures of Danny.  There you go.  I got a pic.  Danny looks pretty comfortable with the chimp there.  Oh, look.  I got like three pictures with him.  All adorable.  Can I have a video?  I want to copy that video tomorrow if I could on a CD. 
[03:31:30]  You know, we're related because the Sicilians.  Oh, brother.  Well, it's been a fun show.  All right, guys.  We got to get out of here.  Feel better, doll.  Yeah, back to bed.
