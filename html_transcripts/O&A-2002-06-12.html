<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a series of commercials for car dealerships, a night guard for teeth grinding, Priceline.com, and Stacker 2 fat burner.  Opie recounted his sales team's apprehension about him creating commercials featuring them.  The hosts then detailed a previous day's stunt where they repeatedly stapled their legs, showcasing the resulting injuries (redness, swelling, pain) and promoting a video of the event on foundrymusic.com.  Listener reactions, ranging from amusement to disgust, were aired.  A new contest, “Whip-Em-Out Wednesday (WOW),” was announced, encouraging listeners to display “WOW” stickers on their vehicles for a chance to have female listeners show their breasts on air. One caller expressed dislike for a particular song.

The show then centered around a planned “staple gun roulette” game for nine studio contestants, where the winner, avoiding being stapled, would receive a trip to a WWE event.  Extensive discussion ensued about the pain, rules, and potential injuries, referencing the hosts' prior self-stapling experience. A lengthy discussion about nudity in men's locker rooms followed, featuring graphic descriptions and numerous listener calls detailing various awkward and humorous encounters, including one caller’s bizarre story about his grandmother discovering a dead man in a bag, and another about finding men masturbating in a sauna.  The conversation delved into the hosts' personal views on masculinity and grooming habits, specifically male pubic hair removal,  with graphic descriptions of shaving and stubble.

The preparation for the "staple gun roulette" continued, with the arrival of Lewis Black, a comedian, as an in-studio guest who shared his experiences and discussed his upcoming performance.  Numerous commercials aired during this segment, including for Comcast, Red Bull, 7-Eleven, and various car services, along with promotion of WWE events and musical acts. A caller recounted a bizarre encounter with women in Japan splashing water on each other's genitals before entering a communal bath.  More commercials aired, including for Amstel Light, *The Bourne Identity* and *Undercover Brother*, several car dealerships, Hotwire, ReMax, Miller Lite, Joseph A. Bank, and Strauss Discount Auto.

The "staple gun roulette" game commenced with ten male contestants and Melissa Ann and Alexis Winston (former Penthouse Pets representing Looks for Less) operating the staple guns.  The winner received a trip to WWE's King of the Ring. The segment involved crude commentary from the hosts and contestants, with frequent references to body parts and much audience laughter.  The game played out over a significant portion of the broadcast, punctuated by more commercials and banter, referencing past show segments and FCC issues.  Further commercials aired, including for Mitsubishi cars, Modell's, Best Buy, Remax, Consolidated Credit Counseling, Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, and Pennsylvania's adult basic health coverage.  A significant discussion with Melissa Ann and Alexis Winston followed, covering breast augmentation, personal experiences, and Opie’s unusual method of age-guessing involving examining a woman’s genitals.  The show concluded with the final round of "staple gun roulette" (resulting in an injured contestant and a winner), additional discussion, and the usual end-of-show bits.

And I describe it this way  It feels like I got a booster shot  Yeah  Remember when you were young  And you had to get the booster shot  And it was just all numb  And just awful  In your arm  Yeah, it felt all swollen  And gave you that nauseous feeling  If you pushed on it too much 
[00:12:00]  Get all queasy  Drink to your leg  Drink to your leg  See that scar?  Staple competition  Opie and Anthony show  Yeah, I get home  And I sit down on the couch  I got shorts on  And my girlfriend wants to say  She goes, all right, let me say  So I show her the good leg  And I go, look, you can barely even see a scratch  I go, there's one there  And I'm just pointing at nothing  Yeah  She goes, oh, God, that was nothing  I go, yeah, but this leg really got it  She's like, oh, no  Oh, no 
[00:12:30]  Looks like I have a leg  I have an attack of the prickly heat  The prickly heat  It does look like prickly heat  What is prickly heat?  I don't know  Something that, I don't know  That was told to me many times growing up  Oh, you got prickly heat  It hurt pretty good last night  And they were really red  Really red  And then today  They're pinking up a little bit  Yeah  It's a little pink  A lot of fun, though  That was a lot of fun yesterday 
[00:13:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, kids?  Hey  Hey, question for you  Yeah  Actually, new contest  New contest today  Let's see who's got the most different colors on their legs  From the bruising  The what?  How many colors do you guys have showing up on your legs  From the bruising from yesterday?  Oh, he's trying so hard, Opie  Yes  Okay, sir  Hey, Chris  What city are you calling from?  This is Cleveland  Oh, boy  You just represented Cleveland 
[00:13:30]  Oh, and Cleveland's got a lot of really big fans  Oh, boy  Cleveland's going to have to make it up to us today  All right, thank you, Chris  All right  Gomez from D.C.  Yeah  Best video ever  Goddamn, I watched the video on foundrymusic.com last night  Of the two of you shooting staples into your legs  I laughed until I passed out  I got to say  The video is really  Yep  Really funny  Very funny  A little bit disturbing  But very  A little  Very funny 
[00:14:00]  A little  There's one point  It hurt so much  That one of the staples I took  I take my headphones off  I just throw them right in the garbage  Yeah  Right next to me  And just ran out of the studio  The clips are getting pounded  People are downloading them like crazy  You go to foundrymusic.com  You can see the video  Of the whole staple gun thing  That Ant and I were doing yesterday  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  That's our underground website, okay?  Yes  And you can get to it  Through opiananthony.com  But it's not too obvious right now  That you can go to foundrymusic.com 
[00:14:30]  Yeah  There's a little tiny little thing  On the top of the page  The last clip of you  Just putting the staple in your leg  Is brutal to watch  You just put the stapler down  There's a long pause  A couple of false starts  You know what the best part of that clip is?  And I didn't realize this was going on  When we were doing it on the radio yesterday  I finally just do it, right?  I start screaming  And I guess the scream got very contagious  Really fast  Because everyone started screaming 
[00:15:00]  Did you notice that?  And then the camera's moving up and down  Because Steve, I guess, is laughing so hard  Or he's screaming too  But the camera just starts shaking like crazy  It's hard to watch  And I hear tell there's going to be some people  Experiencing that very pain today  Well, there was a reason we went through that yesterday  We had to take one for the team  Because the lawyers were getting involved  With another one of our bits  And we're like, look, man  If we take a staple  It's no big deal, see? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  And then it got a lot more involved  Than that yesterday, obviously  But because we took one for the team yesterday  We will be doing staple gun roulette today  And the winner will walk away  With a trip to see King of the Ring  In Columbus, Anthony  The WWE pay-per-view that is happening  I was wondering how many drunks  Are going to try to do that  When they're out at a bar  Or hanging out at their friend's house  The newspaper thing  Because that's how it worked yesterday  Well, I've seen that done a lot  With that  With the newspaper? 
[00:16:00]  Well, the backyard wrestling and stuff  They go right for the skull and stuff  Yeah, but you know something?  They're a bunch of degenerates  I'm just talking about  And we are  Yeah, I know  And you and I are  The thing is  This is  This is something that  It started off fine  Because the newspaper  We laid a newspaper over our leg  And shot the staple through the newspaper  And into our leg  And then each time we passed the stapler back and forth  We would remove one sheet of newspaper 
[00:16:30]  And after a while  The paper got really thin  And I don't know what I was thinking  I didn't think we'd get that far  That it would really, really start hurting  You know what it was?  But it's a great game  The adrenaline just took over  Yeah  You had to go  You had to take the next shot  I was freaked out  It hurt  But it was more the adrenaline  Was just like  Oh God, we gotta keep going  We gotta keep going  It was like a drug yesterday  Uh-huh  So  But you gotta check out the video clips 
[00:17:00]  Go to foundrymusic.com  We gotta pound that site today  Because it's really funny  Oh yeah  And I can't wait to just see  Some of our listeners in here today  Experiencing that very pain  Yeah, so we got  Nine guys so far  That have arrived  We're waiting for one more  Let's do electric shocks next  No we can do  No  Don't they have those machines?  I'm not gonna  I can suggest something  I don't know if I have the balls to do it 
[00:17:30]  But I'll just throw it out there  The torture chamber  Oh  There's something that we could all do  And we'd be safe doing it  But it would be so effing nerve wracking  Uh-oh  Remember when you were a kid  And you by accident  Had your little fingertip into a socket?  You can't do that  You can die  I stuck tweezers in a lightsaber  Remember just  But you would just touch it really fast  And you'd get that  Yeah  It's called electrocution  Let's see who has the balls to do that on the show 
[00:18:00]  I did when I was a kid  I took tweezers  And I guess I was six years old  And I shoved them right in the goddamn electrical socket  And it was only because I was holding them at the tip  Like at the very end  The opposite end that went into the wall  And it shorted out before it hit my fingers  But it got really hot  Because it's short now  You know  But if I was touching them  Like down where two separate pieces of metal were in my fingers  Oof  Wouldn't be here  A little barbecued six-year-old laying on the floor 
[00:18:30]  For mommy to find when she gets home  Comes in the room  There I am  Maybe that's what happened to my hair  Go frizzed up like a goddamn Angela Davis afro  Hey Jared, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, man  Jamie, Jamie  He eats the sandwiches  Yo, man  I totally missed it yesterday  But I just saw the clip  My legs hurt  That was ridiculous  Total cringe radio at its best  It really did hurt  The video clip is really funny 
[00:19:00]  We played the video clip  How many times in the back office?  Like 10, 15 times?  I had him  I was driving stinky nuts  Because I kept saying  Dude, dude, play it again  And then  Because it's foundry music  He has to go through this whole process  To get it to play again  And every time we played it  We were laughing that much harder  You've got to be careful, though  With the stapler thing  Because my friend, Mabel King  Had really bad results  Mabel King  All right, Jared  Thank you  Okay, thanks, guys  Bye  Bye  He gave me  the name of jared he loved the way with sandwiches hooray for abes

[00:48:30]  there's a club of them at the gym i go to and they all walk around with their junk flapping  around in the breeze we got a lot of email on uh your observation as far as the men's locker rooms  go i i covered all the bases i said all all men that walk around the locker room naked now i'm not  talking about in the shower you you're naked in the shower that's fine not my cup of tea i'm not 
[00:49:00]  participating and i got one for you what if you want to get an accurate uh weight if you're weighing  yourself no you know something what what what what kind of thing are you going through how  crazy are you that the weight of the towel is going to screw up your weight you just want an  accurate weight stop it just get dressed throw the towel out when you're done and subtract it says  right it says 166 and you know you're 165 and you're thinking the wet towel a one pound towel  stop it it's nothing there is no reason men should be walking around the locker room of the health 
[00:49:30]  club what if you have uh one period one towel and you just took that shower and now you have to dry  your hair get another goddamn towel there are plenty of towels the places there's a whole counter where  the guy's only job is to give you a towel and you could ask for another towel there's the places that  you put the towel when you're done the place where you get the towel there's no towel shortage  there's the reason there's no guy walking around nude going i can't find a goddamn towel i'm naked 
[00:50:00]  how about this you're drying off and yeah and you got hairy legs and you're like oh man i got to dry  off my legs use the one you just used on your head but you only have one towel no you have you there's  two towels there's plenty of towels but see the gym i go to you you only get one towel no you don't  and no they don't there is no way you can't get two towels what if you're in the shower and your  towel is hanging outside your shower and you you get out of the shower and there's a towel thief look 
[00:50:30]  i said the shower thing is fine no that the towel thief it happens in a lot of these gyms you know  they think towel thief they think it's it's all fun and games to take your towel while you're showering  now what do you do well then towel thief guy is uber gay and guy that walks around is uh is gay too  well is it okay to uh to waddle from the shower to the towel area just holding no no covering your  package no there are plenty of towel i don't know what gym you're speaking of what there are plenty 
[00:51:00]  of available towels in these gyms you grab a couple and you're running and your towel falls off well fire  i gotta uh you know something even then you grab the goddamn towel what if it falls off and there's  people behind you and you're afraid if you stop you'll have to bend over in front of men with towels  around their way die naked in a fire then there's no reason that a guy should be walking around the 
[00:51:30]  locker room naked you take your shower you take your towel you dry off you wear your towel back to  your locker where the the clothing is and then you get dressed there's the area in front of your  locker okay right there okay you gotta be naked there because you just got out of the shower  the shower area okay you gotta be naked there whatever you know it's the shower area anywhere  in between in that no naked man's land you should not be naked if you are you are a gay man if you ever 
[00:52:00]  have been naked in the area between the shower and your locker you are a homosexual you are a gay man  because there ain't no chicks showing up in the men's locker room if you're walking around naked  thinking you're gonna score some hot chick because you're gonna see your hog no just men you are  walking around where only men will see your nudity anthony oh what's up oh and hey hey all right anthony  i got one for you you gotta help me out here basic training 60 guys we all shower together and only 
[00:52:30]  one talent don't ask don't tell but no not even that but does that make us gay for no no you know  why you are being forced to only have one towel or shower with a bunch of guys if you're forced to be  gay you're not really gay right so no no because they're not making the choice they're being told how  to shower the choice no one's telling the guy you will walk from the shower to your locker completely  naked no one's gonna ask them to do that the military it's a different story so my heterosexuality 
[00:53:00]  is preserved you are still hetero thank you sir all right goodbye what if you're in a nazi prison camp  and the shower they put you in doesn't have water coming out again they are following orders  and of course that is horrific and uh but they are not gay oh boy craig what's up hey what's up  anthony norton uh first time long time um i'm calling out from philly and i just wanted to say i 
[00:53:30]  wanted to chime in not to beat a dead horse but i i think norton's being a big puss with not taking  one for the team you think that oh i mean uh he he talks about sticking uh a balloon now that's just  stupid can i tell you something craig out of all of us uh jim norton is the one that will not  fold to uh peer pressure nope well it's not peer pressure it's just taking one for the team  wait dude if i was here i would have done it i wasn't so i won't because that's a lot of sums that 
[00:54:00]  up i would if you're a liar if all the guys were doing it i would have done it all right lois what's  up hey how's it going hey lois hey uh we i'm on the akron right now down by cleveland and we got  these four girls in this convertible wowing everybody wow just wanted to inform all you  guys about that everyone listening what road what road uh about 77 going north from akron up to  cleveland oh they're giving everyone a show today in cleveland cool thanks lois two of them are 
[00:54:30]  thunder chunks and tell norton to stop being a pussy thunder chunks thunder chunks oh i got it but they  have youth on their side dave what's going on hey i belong to one of those country clubs and and all  you get is these old guys with their junk hanging out all over the place all i do is walk around  naked yeah the old guys at the turkish taffy yam bag slapping off their knees called old man  or paul from boston saying at the gym uh he goes to there's a tv in the men's locker room i come in 
[00:55:00]  from where i got there are fat naked men all sitting around watching tv what the f is that all about  and they're discussing the news and as and their junk is laying on the chair it's effing awful see  there is no reason naked men should be standing around or sitting there watching television or the  conversation guys hey i'm completely naked i could get dressed but i choose to stand here talking to  another completely nude man that is what what is the purpose of that is it there that there's so 
[00:55:30]  confident in their masculinity and so so uh confident that they are so hetero that it doesn't matter that  they could stand there and look at another man's nasty bird nest with a junk just ugh ugh that they could stand  there and look at it oh sure you look them right in the face but your peripherals pick up this big blotch 
[00:56:00]  yeah stop it there's no reason for that hey here comes naked guy look i'm not looking at him but in  my peripheral vision uh mike wants to know what about the guys that shave and brush their teeth naked  gay they're preoccupied with something else no they're not really looking for action wear the  towel no they're all looking for action let me ask mike they're looking for the guy to come up and go  nice see mike go ahead yeah i was just saying like you guys said but uh the other thing that that uh 
[00:56:30]  tops it off is like there's a guy you suspect may be gay and then uh when he walks by you know you're  not looking but he's completely shaved and like that is that is not right completely yes shaved guys  walking around it's disgusting all right you guys brushing your teeth is all right but it depends on  what you're brushing your teeth with if you're brushing it with bob you know that might be gay  i'm dead i'm just saying there's no reason for it besides wanting okay besides wanting other men 
[00:57:00]  to see your nude body maybe you're hung like a horse and you're like you just want to like rub it in  like look what i got you know and you don't got one of these you know what let the ladies go oh he's  hung like a horse why he's supposed to put your a little cover over your porsche just because  there's guys around now you drive it right by the way it should be with a big delicious thick  girth ridden c show everyone let them all laugh and be jealous so you're making a comeback jim

[00:58:00]  they do remember anthony john wants to know uh if you could give yourself a uh you know what  yeah you could give yourself treats is that gay um if you can give yourself treats is it gay that's  an interesting question yeah this is one of the you know what of the ages a question for the ages  because and i will not be answering because either way you're gonna be this is a question  that is for the ages because uh a lot of uh guys that have sat around naked in locker rooms have 
[00:58:30]  discussed this now a lot of people that you get it with your group of friends and and i guess the  subject has come up at some point or another sure can you have you would you well my opinion on the  whole thing i'll be is if uh oh boy if you were let's say you're just experimenting with even jack in  it right everyone's slapping the console gun i'll stay for right now i i never have i never have 
[00:59:00]  you've never what i've never done the oral treat on myself oh okay i'm saying if you were able to  and you're at that point where you're just cranking it every two seconds and it's not like you can  you know leave a junior high and get a girl every other night maybe that would be considered  experimenting what do you think jim anything there if i could do it not only would i but i would grab  the back of the back of my own head and make myself take it on the face  and i'd have no problems with that at all slapping yourself after i really was spitting

[02:42:30]  lemon or a lime before you can drink them is it because these beers are a little deficient in the  flavor department oh i'm sorry when it said beer on the label i actually thought it would taste like  i don't know beer of course there's always amstel light which has the perfect proportions of barley  hops and yeast did you notice i left out fruit now i have nothing against the hard-working lemon and  lime producers of the world but when i want a beer i'm not looking for some bizarro mango kiwi surprise 
[02:43:00]  i want something that tastes like beer like amstel light they don't need to pull some cover-up of  watergate proportions to distract you from its taste amstel light tastes good because it's from  amsterdam and it's made by people who have beer in their blood so next time you're ordering a beer  tell them to skip the fruit cocktail and give you an amstel light always satisfying never watered down 
[02:43:30]  amstel light the beer drinkers light beer imported by amstel usa white plains new york  jameson if we're going to get the best buy account our research needs inside substance so what have we  learned about the young people of today well it seems they want pony rides oh sir only rides you  see what i was actually sir they like best buy because they can try stuff out like portable stuff  for summer mp3 players pdas car stereos no mention of ponies no sir no ponies doesn't that strike you as

[03:17:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Staple Gun Roulette on the show today.  We're down to, what, four contestants?  The guys are making their way back into the studio.  And why don't you explain real fast?  Maybe people just tuning in.  They got out of work late today.  I don't know.  We started with ten guys and ten Staple Guns.  One of the Staple Guns full of staples.  The other nine empty. 
[03:18:00]  And each one would come up, pick a Staple Gun, and one of our lovely penthouse pets would take that Staple Gun,  put it against their ass, and hit it.  And whoever got the Staple was out for that round.  We are now down to four contestants, four staplers, three of which are empty.  One has staples in it.  And we continue.  The winner is the guy that does not get hit with a staple.  Now, we were talking to the ladies during the commercials, and they were bitching, 
[03:18:30]  because one of these guys, is the guy still left in the contest?  One of the guys was kind of sporting and showing his mule.  His mule, they said his mule was sticking straight out.  Yeah, I saw your fur.  You might not have realized it, but he did.  Get it where you can.  I was going to say, I don't blame the guy.  When's the next time you'll be able to do that without getting arrested? 
[03:19:00]  Good man.  All right, that's Pets of the Year.  All right, Anthony, we got, like you said, we're down to four staple guns on the counter.  One is loaded.  Three are not.  Who's up next?  Carmen?  Carmen.  No more shout-outs, right?  All right.  This is for the trip to see King of the Ring, Anthony, in Columbus, Ohio.  Columbus Beckins, WWE pay-per-view.  You also may notice the staple gun may hit a different area of your body. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, we forgot to tell everybody.  Because this is the finals.  This is the finals, so you guys have to make it harder.  So, drop them lower.  We're going lower.  Oh, my God.  Oh, dude, the guy's naked.  Jesus.  All right, let's be quiet, though.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's be quiet.  Here we go.  Listen.  Oh, God.

I think he's more bummed that he just lost a trip to Columbus.  Come on.  You all right?  Yeah, he's okay.  He seems bummed.  You all right?  He's bummed that he's out.  It didn't hurt too bad?  Yeah.  I think he needs to give a shout-out now.  Any last shout-outs there, bro?  No, look, he's bumming.  He's really bummed that he lost the contest.  All these guys are going to get some parting gifts, so don't worry about it, okay? 
[03:20:30]  Parting gifts?  I don't know.  Lewis, Slack, Town Hall, Friday.  Tickets from Ticketmaster.  What do you want me to say?  You've won the Datsun B-210.

Sean, you get to pick.  Rob gets the remaining stapler.  Are you sure you want that?  Here it is. 
[03:22:30]  Comes down a 50-50 shot.  All right.  Sean has picked a staple gun.  That means Rob has the one that is remaining on the counter.  Hold on.  We've got to make sure we mic this very well.

[03:31:30]  These are huge.  Sorry.  Look for less helps me out.  I wanted to do it for the same reasons, not for my career.  How big were you originally?  I was a D.  And now what are you?  Like a G.  No.  No, I'm not that big.  Wow.  All right.  Now just remember, like I said, keep in mind, I just had a baby.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Can I see the other?  Wow.  Boy.  Wow.  Wow.  My, my, my, Lois Black.  But see, this is what this company is for. 
[03:32:00]  People like me who have kids and they're not in our business making the money to pay  $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 for breast augmentation.  Right.  They can pay $2,000.  You know, dollars.  A little discount.  $2,900.  You can't beat that.  Do they actually make your mule bigger or do they just shrink your hands?  No.  Well, see, you would have to.  I don't know about that because I don't know.  Like Voss.  I don't go down there.  Look how big it is in my hands.  I know.  These girls could be talking about physics.  You guys just be, uh-huh. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Anthony and I do not like having hot girls in here because it just ruins the radio show.  I mean, we love looking at hot girls, but it just, we're getting nothing done.  Except for us, too.  We're good sports.  Well, you're crazy if you want to do anything to those.  You guys have a bond with us.  Huh?  Because you have a bond with us.  Yes, we do.  Because we were on the show when you guys were syndicated that day.  That's right.  We hosted the Pet of the Year party last night.  We have been with you the whole way.  And you know, we'd like you to come to our Pet of the Year party tomorrow night. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, really?  We'd like you to join us.  We'll pick you up.  We'll pick you up in the limo.  We'd like you to come.  Oh, the limo with the penthouse pets.  Yeah, there's like 12 penthouse pets in town.  We'd like you to come.  To the party, right?  Yeah, come to the party.  Look at Lewis Hyde.  Hyde.  The one that you hosted last year.  Yeah, we say that.  I wonder who's hosting it this year.  I wonder who they go to after you two.  Ah.  It's not going to be as good.  Smokey.  Yeah.  Smokey.  Smokey. 
[03:33:30]  Smokey.  Smokey's hosting.  All right, Melissa, you talked about this thing, but you've got to give out the phone number.  Oh, yeah.  So people know where to go.  Yes, you're right.  1-800-842-8424, extension 1.  It's very easy.  Call it up, and they have great people there to help you.  And there's a website, too?  All 50 states, there's a place.  So it doesn't matter where you live.  Just call that number, and they'll help you out.  And the website is looksforless.com.  Looks for less.  See my picture on it.  Is it number four or words four? 
[03:34:00]  Looks.  Four.  Look for less.  F-O-R.  Less.  Ah.  And like I said, you'll see my picture.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  All right, don't get your boobs done.  No.  I really, you guys, I really didn't know that.  You asked her, Pete.  You asked her, Pete.  She plays with Mayan all the time.  You know, we gave you the opinion.  It's completely wrong.  Really?  I'm serious.  Well, I just don't get it.  I've never understood it, because they end up...  Well, see, I didn't need them, but I'll be honest with you, when I got them, it  was the best thing I ever did.  Seriously, personally, I just... 
[03:34:30]  They're a very, very nice nan.  Can I just tell you, in a sexual matter...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Certainly.  Everyone be quiet.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Yeah?  Ever since I had them, you do not...  I don't even have to have sex to have an orgasm.  Oh, really?  All you have to do is touch them and tongue them, and I am there.  Wow.  But I'm like that.  There it is.  Hey!  There...  What did they install?  Did that make the radio?  I'm kidding.  What did they install?  Ah, wow.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  She basically doesn't need to have sex to... 
[03:35:00]  Right.  ...to...  Thanks, too.  Okay, oh, wait, yeah, right.  And then being done, I swear to God.  That was very nice.  That's wild.  And usually...  Yeah, you'd think it would take away the feeling.  You'd boast to, because...  Anything else wrong with you guys that you want us to check out?  You know, you can look at my website, alexismunston.com.  You can see her in many positions there.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can guess my age.  What's my age?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't...  No, I'll be asked to look at your taint to do that.  No, she didn't.  No one heard it.  No, she didn't.  What happened?  She didn't tell her age.  No, you did. 
[03:35:30]  Okay, so look at your taint.  How old do you think I am?  There's a whole thing I do.  But you said you're 28.  Yeah.  She's...  I don't know.  Oh, she did?  Then I can't do it.  Because I don't want people to think I fake her.  Who cares what they say when you're looking at that?  I really don't...  Yeah.  I don't know, but someone will call me out on it.  So what?  Let them.  What?  I know what it is, but I'll tell you if it's right when you guess.  Do you really honestly think you're going to get to check her age?  Does it really matter?  No, it's the way Opie does it. 
[03:36:00]  Okay, go ahead.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  He is actually a miracle worker when it comes to this.  Oh, I want to know.  How many girls have come in?  Make eye contact and tell her how you do it.  How many girls have come in, Opie?  How are you doing, Opie?  How many girls have you got the age on?  I think I'm like seven for seven.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, seven for seven to the year.  It's amazing, but...  You'll have to be completely naked.  He looks...  Really?  Okay, so I have an issue of Penthouse that I'm in this month, the August issue.  I'll show it to you.  Because it's not just naked.  Yeah, but it's a little furry down here.  Tell her what you do, Opie.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:36:30]  Opie's going to tell you what he does.  Tell her where you look.  I would use the magazine, but with some airbrushing, it's going to throw off my powers.  No, Penthouse magazine does not airbrush nothing.  It's not close enough, and you can't see what he has to look at.  She does have a skirt on, so that will be easier.  Oh, I'm curious.  Opie, tell her what you have to look at.  No, you can tell me with clothes on.  How old do you think I am?  No, but that's not the game.  It's not the test.  What do you look at?  The taint area.  You're seven for seven.  What?  He looks right at a girl's taint.  What's a taint?  What's a taint?  It taint the front, and it taint the back.  Is it the cookie? 
[03:37:00]  Right in between.  Right?  It's right in between.  It's right in between.  I can tell a lot about a girl.  What?  How is that?  Yeah.  Does it glow?  He has never told anybody.  It's just something that has been passed down from my dad.  Yeah, like the rings on a tree thing.  Are you serious?  Your dad showed you that trick when you were young, didn't he?  He's amazing.  I'm totally serious.  Are you serious?  Yes.  By looking at that.  I will be within a year.  You're seven for seven.  Guaranteed.  Come on, let him do it.  So if I show you my cookie.  No cameras.  No cameras.  You'll tell me how old I am? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I need about 15 to 20 seconds.  Okay.  You're staring at it?  Let's do it.  I need about 15 to 20 minutes.  I might pass out.  No, you'll be fine.  All right.  No, no, you got to...  You're the other way.  Look at them guys.  Look at everyone shifting in the studio.  You got to turn around.  I'm not wearing panties.  Hey, what happened?  Penthouse pets don't wear panties.  What happened down there, though?  I got in a treadmill accident.  Oh, okay.  A treadmill.  What happened?  Listen to you.  What happened down there?  Yeah, you got to turn around and that way.  Oh, good God. 
[03:38:00]  Who cares how old she is?  What?  You got to bend over and lift up.  Yeah, and then he looks.  No cameras.  No, no cameras.  But now look, Opie.  That's what he's got to look at.  That's what he's got to look at.  I think you should know.  I think you should be able to tell from my cookie.  I think you should just be able to tell from my cookie.  Well, I saw the other.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  You can see from there.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  How old am I?  I'm curious.  Come on.  How old am I?  You can tell, say.  You know what?  I know what you're looking at, and it's great.  You have probably the best one I've ever seen. 
[03:38:30]  Wow.  There's no problems there.  Look it out.  I have friends that I noticed.  I noticed.  Oh, my God.  I know girls.  I know what you're looking at.  What am I looking at?  I know.  Well, I don't know if I'm saying that.  Okay.  What am I looking at?  What?  I think you're looking at the girls.  I think you're looking at the parts and how well they've been used.  I think it's called the songs.  And that's with age.  No.  He never tells anybody this.  Yeah, and I think that that's what you're looking at. 
[03:39:00]  And I know that mine's funny.  And I'm ready.  You're ready.  What?  Do you want to double check?  He's good.  Yeah, I'm going to double check.  I'm going to double check.  I'm going to double check.  Look at Norton who comes running by here.  Can Louis see this?  No, no, no.  This is just for me and you.  But he doesn't get to see this type of thing.  No, this is just for you and me.  All right.  It is.  All right.  I've got to do a little subtraction.  I don't care.  I don't know.  Okay.  I'm there.  You got it?  How old is she?  How old am I?  Oh, boy.  Twenty. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, that's going out on a limb.  Yeah.  And notice that I'm shaved.  And this month in Penthouse, I'm not.  So it's a little different.  Okay.  All natural.  They're going to dump out.  So don't say anything.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  Oh, you heard me on the air.  I did not.  You got it again?  Twenty-six.  Son of a bitch.  Every time.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Our first ever Penthouse pet.  Wow. 
[03:40:00]  Teen's guessing of age.  But you need to tell us the secret.  I can't.  Yeah.  Well, we want to use it.  There's something down there that's telling me.  Well, you see, like you look at that.  And you subtract.  You're looking at something.  Stop pointing.  You subtract that and that.  And you add that.  You add what?  Wait, wait.  You add what?  That.  This?  No.  Down more.  You count this.  The thigh or the thigh?  No, you count this times two minus seven for that.  And that.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six. 
[03:40:30]  Positive.  It's hot, huh?  It's very hot.  Very hot.  Trust me.  It's very hot.  Yeah, it's hot.  Okay.  Yeah, you get it.  Wow.  Melissa's amazed over there.  I am.  I'm, like, taken away right now.  We only do that little thing with special girls.  Very special, yeah, because it rarely ever happens.  Because they won't let you look at it, probably.  No, you're right.  It only hits me every once in a while.  It's a weird thing how that happens.  Sometimes Ann wants me to guess, and I'm just not feeling the power. 
[03:41:00]  One time he actually said, and I swear, I don't remember who it was, but he guessed the age,  and it was a year lower than the age, and then before anything he went, no, no, wait a minute.  You, your birthday's in December or something.  Like, he knew that it was close enough, and then he put the age over where it was supposed to be.  Like, he looked again and then realized.  That's impressive.  So he can tell within months, I think, sometimes.  Why are you doing this for a living? 
[03:41:30]  He should be in a carnival.  Why are you doing radio?  He could do this for a living.  Look at Lewis.  You're amazed, right?  He's jealous.  He's jealous.  I wouldn't be doing radio, okay?  I would take this act on the road.  I could be like one of those.  I'd be going from village to town going, you know, ha, ha, ha.  I could do the guess your weight game.  You could do the guess your hoo-ha.  Go from village to town.  What year are you living in, Lewis?  I go from village to town to hamlet.  Here, here, here, here.  Here, here, here, here.  You talk like a Paul Revere speech. 
[03:42:00]  I'm like, is the bruise okay, though?  Okay, so you guys, do you guys want to know what happened?  Yeah, she's got.  Oh, my God, it's so bad.  Dude, she's got a huge bruise on the ground.  Okay, so I have a huge, okay, so you guys want to hear the messed up story, seriously?  Of course you do.  I'm running on my treadmill.  Yeah.  And I get distracted.  James, stop this crazy thing.  I get distracted by somebody whipping me with a dog leash.  Oh.  Okay, as I'm running, so I fall off the treadmill.  And keep in mind, treadmills keep going.  They don't stop.  So they keep going. 
[03:42:30]  The treadmill keeps going.  So I'm jammed in between the wall and the treadmill.  Oh, my God.  And it, thank, I'm, thank God it didn't hit my cookie because I was a bit of an insult.  So I have a bruise there.  Yeah, I have a bruise.  It's on my cookie, and I can't shoot for a while, but.  And then he started running on the treadmill.  Wow.  Well, now I'm kind of a little scared of the treadmill.  But yeah, so I've got the bruise there, and it was jamming me.  And I have a scratch on my back from it, too.  I have a little.  Oh, my God.  That's a big scratch.  Like, it jammed me against the wall. 
[03:43:00]  And was the treadmill going, eeeh, and rubbing on you?  Oh, my God.  And I was so upset because I'm like, this thing won't turn off.  It doesn't realize that I'm against the wall.  You know, whenever you've imagined, I wonder what type of accidents penthouse pets have.  Really?  There you go.  Well, yeah.  Was it making this noise?  Brr, brr, brr.  Yeah, it was so messed up.  I finally, like, rolled over and got away from it.  But I'm okay.  And it didn't hurt my private parts, so I'm fine. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, thank God for that.  Like a sail on a windy day.  It's like a work-related injury.  You all right in there?  Who was whipping you with the dog?  Why didn't they help you?  No.  That's a little, that's the odd part of the story.  No, actually, no.  A friend of mine was, like, messing around.  We were, it was just, really, it sounds weird, but it was just like a joke.  And I obviously can't concentrate and run at the same time.  I have to do one or the other.  Yeah.  Why didn't they help you? 
[03:44:00]  It was too funny.  I was just going to say that because it was a little bit too funny.  So I, so I, it was, it all happened so fast.  Oh, that, like, just the thought of that.  Yeah.  Very painful.  So do you see what we modeled to have to get through while we work out?  That's our next contest.  We're having 10 girls coming with treadmills.  I, I, wow, you're beautiful.  Thank you for that.  You're welcome.  That was a lot of fun today.  Usually I hate doing that.  Well, thank you for having us.  Thank you for having us.

A big shwoogie from Boston.  It's nice to see that Opie's curse is alive and well.  And then he has my quote.  Opie's saying, I think Smokey's going to win the whole thing.  Seconds later, Smokey.  Ah! 
[03:52:30]  Very good.  Today I learned it's only gay if you paint it black and force yourself on it.  That's Kyle from Philly.  Nice.  Bleacher Anthony.  Today I learned when you shave your yam bag a week later, it feels like a pin cushion when you slam your chick.  Alex, one leg.  Today I learned that in the summer, summer, excuse me, we are no longer interested in hockey, but we're interested in having extramarital affairs.  Todd from Buffalo.  Today I learned I better not be taking a drink at 345 tomorrow.  Very good.  He also learned there's no such thing as small breasts and naked crunches, never good. 
[03:53:00]  Ugh.  Todd also learned Jewish kids either have asthma or ear infections.  Bleacher Anthony again.  Today I learned according to Opie, all men must leave a little bush around the tree.  We should ask the girls.  Should a guy like shave his...  Shave.  Shave it.  Absolutely.  Shave it.  Hey, wait.  Let me ask you this.  Now I'm looking good, right?  Do you like a clean...  I looked a little stupid a few hours ago.  Do you like a clean...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  With a little...  With a just a little... 
[03:53:30]  You know something?  Why does it have to be one or the other?  Why not a little variety like one...  Oh, it doesn't show much...  I'm not talking about, you know, the big pool rack full of Afro hair.  It's alive and going much better without...  Well, I'm just talking like...  Why does it have to be always shaved a certain way?  Oh, not a certain way.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, cleaned up, yes.  You don't want that big mess.  I want to ask the Pets of the Year.  Yes, ma'am.  Let me discuss this to you. 
[03:54:00]  Smooth?  Smooth, because when you're...  When you're down...  Right, right.  You're absolutely smooth.  Imagine just smooth.  Okay.  Too much information.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We'll use the Razor, boys.  Girls like it.  Definitely.  The Pets of the Year think I'm normal, Anthony.  There you go.  The Pets of the Year.  That's right.  Take it from us.  Now, every guy is going to do it.  They'll go home to their nasty housewives.  They'll go, you sick son of a bitch. 
[03:54:30]  She was the Pets of the Year in 2000 and the Pets of the Year in 2001.  And okay by them that I, Opie, make it smooth.  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh, and can we see it?  We'll do it for you.  Yeah, we'll do it for you.  We'll do it for you.  Wow.  Look at that offer.  All right.  When did those offers used to pour in?  Oh, I got more Penthouse Pets of the Year on the phone wanting to shave me.  Penthouse is a huge fan of Opie and Anthony's out. 
[03:55:00]  We are a huge fan of you guys.  We love you guys.  All right.  I've jacked many years to Penthouse.  Sure.  Let's just don't make any more Anna Kornikova mistakes, okay?  All right, ladies.  And then that.  It's all about Alexis Winston right now.  No, Melissa Ann, thank you.  Okay.  All right.  I guess we're done for today.  I want to thank all the guys that got stapled.  Yeah, sorry guys.  Eight for eight.  You're eight for eight now?  Yeah.  Good job. 
[03:55:30]  Great job with the taint kissing.  What are you going to do with those shaplers now?  Okay, I guess we're done.  I'm talking to the instant feedback group right now.  You have nothing.  What do you mean?  They're trying instant feedback.  What do we learn?  But, you know.  Are the EMS guys have plugs?  Got a plug?  Can we pull a Jimmy Norton real quick?  You're going to be at an accident scene where?  You're right.  We want to say hello to the guys over at Station 60 of Staten Island.  A couple of Staten Island guys here should be screaming and yelling outside. 
[03:56:00]  Thanks for letting us out.  Oh, great.  Jimmy, I'll give you the final word today.  I'm not going to take that kind of pressure.  Oh, man.  I remember in the old days.  All right, I'll give the final word.  Lewis Black this Friday, Town Hall.  The Lewis plug.  Thank you, Lewis.  Always a pleasure, my friend.  Thanks a lot.  I guess we'll see you tomorrow.
