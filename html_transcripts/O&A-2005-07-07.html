<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in offensive banter, quickly transitioning to a discussion of NASA’s Space Shuttle repairs.  Studio guest Colin Quinn discusses his upcoming shows, insults a female audience member's hair, and the conversation shifts to the London bombings, marked by darkly humorous commentary and criticism of media coverage from Fox News and CNN.  Anecdotes about encounters with homeless people, a visit to Robert Kelly, and a detailed, disgusting description of human waste in the studio parking garage (provided by Charlie the Trucker) are interspersed with further cynical commentary on the London bombings.  Jim Norton recounts an offensive anecdote about an airport employee reading a book on Islamic law.  Listener calls from Oklahoma City (regarding media coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing) and Montreal (on the prevalence of terrorists) are featured.  The segment ends with a homeless man's song and more morbidly humorous, offensive jokes.

The show continues with a caller, Mitch from Montreal, detailing a threatening incident with Quebec police, followed by the hosts' mocking criticism of Mitch and offensive jokes about his mother.  This leads to a “Blame Canada” parody filled with vulgar lyrics and a prolonged, juvenile bit about the size of "Ben's hog."  The hosts then discuss office banter and their habit of re-enacting funny workplace conversations on air, including crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  A segment compares original movie dialogue with sanitized TV versions, using examples from *Die Hard 2* and *Dogma*, generating a list of comically-sounding words.  Paul Field and his wife, Denise, are introduced as guest newsreaders, but the segment quickly devolves into a highly personal and sexually explicit account of their unconventional relationship, including online interactions, phone sex, and details of living with Denise's then-husband.  The interview concludes with Paul's humorous anecdote about a sexual encounter with a paralyzed woman.

Another segment features Anthony recounting a graphic sexual encounter with a paralyzed woman, punctuated by crude jokes from Opie and Jimmy.  Jimmy then shares numerous explicit anecdotes about his own coerced sexual experiences, followed by Denise's addition of equally explicit stories and details about her mother's unusual sex education.  The conversation includes graphic descriptions of various sexual acts and uses offensive language.  Brief updates on the London bombing casualty count are interspersed throughout.

A recurring segment with Paul and Denise involves a sexually explicit stunt where Denise attempts (and fails due to technical difficulties) oral sex on Paul under the console. This is accompanied by crude and sexually explicit jokes, homophobic and racist slurs, and a story about Paul having sex with Denise in front of a friend.  The segment includes news reports (interrupted by sexually suggestive banter), stand-up from Brian Regan, and a prank call, along with a phone call from the "Boy Butter" lubricant inventor.

Paul and Denise continue their sexually explicit anecdotes, including Denise's encounters with multiple men, one being a Black soap star.  Paul discusses his "Boy Butter" product line. A caller, Jay Moore, discusses his experience on "Dinner for Five," mentioning Michael Rapaport's intoxication. The conversation moves to online forums with racist images, and the relative fame of Pat Battle and Sue Simmons.  The hosts discuss Jay Moore's continued support, the show's online message boards, and the absence of other guests like Dice and Brewer. The show ends with further sexually explicit jokes, a listener suggesting a ridiculous word ("cattywampus"), and mentions of a fan-sent pillow and Vince Van Patten's travel habits.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes! Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want? 
[00:04:30]  You have the tears to come out of my eyes?  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Mom!  Please stop calling me.  Quiet.  Stop it!  Mom!  I'm not going to.  I have to do this now.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[00:05:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  What the fuck is that?  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  That's what I love about this part of the show.  We just fuck around with clips until one makes us laugh.  Yeah.  That's all that is.  What the fucking lotion on a blouse?  That was one pissed off lunatic.  Can I hear that again? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, I love that one.  What the fucking lotion on a blouse?  A blouse girl.  Good morning and welcome to another Opie and Anthony program.  XM is doing their job by giving us this national platform.  Right.  And now you do your little job.  If you like what you're hearing, you tell a buddy.  And then he tells a buddy. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  They give us the technology.  They give us the machinery.  They've given us like uplinks to satellites and everything.  Isn't that amazing?  Putting all that responsibility in our hands.  Thinking we can just use it and entertain people.  Yeah, we haven't really discussed this before.  How does it feel, Anthony, to be, I don't know, talking through a satellite that's just kind of orbiting around the Earth right now?  It's quite amazing, Opie.  If you ask me, which you just did. 
[00:06:30]  There's some kind of thing up there and our voice is...  There's a satellite up there.  And our voice is just kind of, you know, just transmitting away.  And we talk into the mics and then somehow it comes out people's speakers.  But in between, there's a whirlwind of technology going on that we just don't have a clue about.  No.  Little satellites.  I hear we're in the space shuttle business again.  Wednesday.  Not XM, but I guess we're launching the space shuttle again.  Space shuttle back up after a couple years off.  That old gag.  They hosed that one down for a couple years. 
[00:07:00]  Hosed down the launch pad and let's give it another shot.  Let's move it on.  Give it another shot.  Boy, that's a little scary for the crew going up.  Being the first guy back.  Make sure the concrete and the memorial is all dry.  I hope not.  Yeah, I've always been a big fan of the space program growing up.  Always liked it.  Always kept tabs on everything that was going on with NASA.  And I'd like to see them get back in it again without any big clusterfucks like the last one. 
[00:07:30]  Now, they had two years off, so I'm assuming that we're going to see a brand new space shuttle, right?  You think?  No.  It's the same thing.  It's like some state-of-the-art.  Dude, you think it's going to be different.  You think because it's NASA and the space program, it's going to be different than maybe you driving your car?  But, no, it's the same thing.  They just, they've given the astronauts what amounts to patch kits.  Remember when you were a kid and you got a blowout in your bike tire and you had that patch kit, a little rubber, and the little top with the little cheese grater thing. 
[00:08:00]  You had to rough it up.  That was my favorite thing.  And then the glue that you'd get high off of.  Did that do anything?  Of course not.  The cheese grater thing.  Roughed it up.  Makes for better adhesion.  It rubbed down the wound.  Yeah.  Your tire wound.  Better adhesion.  Well, that's the same thing.  They've given the astronauts, like, patches and the ability to look around the bottom of the shuttle.  So, if there's any missing heat tiles, they can go out there and fix it and patch it up with glue. 
[00:08:30]  Shut up.  No shit.  With tiles and glue.  Yes, I read this in Popular Mechanics.  And they can now get out there because the problem was they were never able to really see the bottom.  Any damage done to the shuttle, they would have to look at films of the shuttle taking off.  And after it was out of sight, they were pretty much stuck with whatever was wrong with it.  And there was a problem.  They lost tiles on, like, the leading edge of one of the wings.  Came in. 
[00:09:00]  Burnt up.  So now, should we be losing tiles in the year 2005?  What's with the tiles?  Where's our force fields?  Where's the force field?  Like Star Trek.  Like stupid, like, bathroom tiles?  That's what they look like.  They're bathroom tiles.  What about Star Wars?  They're zooming up, back, same ship, no boosters, nothing.  Are you trying to tell me the space shuttle's going to look exactly the same to me?  Exactly the same to you.  It's going to look the same.  I ain't watching. 
[00:09:30]  I don't think, I think they're doing away with the foam on the outside, the foam insulation on the outside of the booster, too.  Because that's kind of what broke off and took a bunch of tiles off of the shuttle itself.  Oh, it shakes a lot.  It shakes a lot.  Also, it's frozen.  It's like frozen solid when they take off.  And then that starts thawing out and cracking off.  So they've done away with that.  That might make it look a little different.  I don't think it's going to look as orange.  All right.  Good luck to you.  And Godspeed, I say. 
[00:10:00]  Godspeed.  Mm-hmm.  In studio.  I don't know why.  Colin Quinn.  Colin.  I'm here because I'm lonely and I'm insomniac.  You're an insomniac now, too?  Nah, but, you know, I actually have to leave.  I'm jetting out today to Vegas.  Where are you?  Vegas?  Yeah.  What are you doing there?  I'm doing the Palms.  The Palms?  Nice.  But let me promote.  Next week, I'm doing Caroline's with Keith Robertson, I think his name is.  Oh, my God.  I scored him last night. 
[00:10:30]  That's a huge score.  I think Jim hit it best when somebody said, drop it.  And I said, Keith dropped it.  And Keith goes, I dropped what?  And Norton goes, the ball in 1989.  You're doing Caroline's next weekend?  Mm-hmm.  Next Thursday through Sunday or whatever?  And this is a message.  Please, Lady Diane Marion, I love you.  Don't show up, you ruined lady.  Hi, Colin!  Hi!  As I walked on stage, I was like, ah!  Yeah, frightened. 
[00:11:00]  Well, because they like to wave at their comedian friends.  Screaming, ah!  Why are you trying to do your act?  That's why we call it the retard Laverne Shirley.  No way to miss Marion's hair out there in the crowd.  You just look.  All it needs is like...  Come sail away.  She looks like Dennis DeYoung or Viking from Bad Boys.  Viking.  That's right.  I want to get her in here and just get a football helmet face guard and some Jets decals and  just slap it on the side of that hairdo.  Because I bet it would look very authentic Seahawks. 
[00:11:30]  I bet it would look very authentic.  Face mask.  Yeah, so Colin just kind of stumbled into the office as we were preparing today.  You got an umbrella.  You look like an English gentleman walking in.  Well, look at that awful thing, speaking of England.  Yes!  Our brethren over there in England.  Yeah, well, one guy that has our back.  Right.  We're watching the coverage as we speak and it looks awful.  Lots of explosions.  Sean Alvinport, Tokyo Rose.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't stand her. 
[00:12:00]  So what's the deal?  A series of blasts in London's transportation system.  That's all we know so far.  Down in what they call the Tubes.  The Tubes.  It's called a subway.  What's with their wacky...  Speak English over there.  Could you help us out?  It's the Tubes.  And some explosions there.  And then on their wacky double-decker buses.  Yeah.  They've had some explosions on those.  One bus they showed ripped apart.  The whole upper level was gone.  They're talking about some casualties.  People dead.  What about you saying today about what the news here is going to do? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're taping the news and we're hoping our faithful listeners will help us out all over the country  because they will make this a local story.  Oh, of course.  Bombing on London subways and trains.  How safe is our transportation system?  We'll let you know.  Oh, you just want to reach through the screen and choke somebody.  And they don't even have subways in Iowa, but they'll still do the same story.  Subways, yeah.  Yeah.  They'll figure out a way to make it local to everyone so we could all be scared today. 
[00:13:00]  One thing I'm learning.  From the eyes of your Iowa field capable of exploding.  Yes.  Cornfields exploding.  They have cameras everywhere.  That's what I'm learning here about England.  They are showing closed-circuit TV every road, every sidewalk, everywhere.  You're being recorded.  Oh, that's great.  On something.  Don't they have that so something like this doesn't happen?  Don't they have it?  Where's the guy putting the bombs in the buses?  Where's that video?  Isn't that the reason that they want to watch this 24 hours a day? 
[00:13:30]  I'm sure it looks like.  I think it was suicide bomb.  You think it was suicide?  I think they can find that out pretty quickly.  And no one's said anything yet about it.  No speculation here.  We got Fox News, the alarmist news on.  I was listening to CNN because I have XM satellite radio.  That's the beauty of the satellite radio.  And I was listening to 1010 Winds, which is your regular AM, your amplitude.  Modulation frequency on my radio driving in.  And I wasn't getting the information I wanted. 
[00:14:00]  It wasn't enough.  I'm hearing, you know, ball scores and stuff.  And there's, meanwhile, bombs going off in England.  So I quickly switched to XM and take 15 minutes going through 120 channels to try to find the fucking CNN or some news goddamn channel.  Well, if you knew the service, it would be very easy to find.  I don't know the service.  And why do I have to know?  Can't there be a search feature somewhere where I put C in and CNN comes up?  How about you preset some channels? 
[00:14:30]  I only have so many presets.  My whole one is taken up with, I have top tracks.  I have the 60s, 70s, 80s.  I have Ethel.  I have 90s.  I have New York traffic.  And then on the other one, I have Ethel, Mrs. Trumbull, Ricky, Fred.  Everyone knows it's channel 122, Anthony.  You do not.  You just looked over at Eric and put it up on the...  See, 122.  122?  I started at our channel because I knew it was high up somewhere. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  So I had to go from 202 down 100 channels.  They're not hiding CNN where they hide us.  By that time it was done.  It was old news.  You're talking about crumpets.  You don't think that they thought 202 was just a nice channel number for us.  It was strategically done to hide us.  Well, 201 is remixes of Clay Aiken.  Yeah, they surround us with shit no one wants to hear.  Right.  I have a question, too.  If you put in the search function and you put in C, do you think CNN and then CNT, which  is the Lifetime channel, would pop up? 
[00:15:30]  Well, I was looking for CNN.  Yeah.  And I got Fox News and just the alarmist, speculating Fox News.  They had no information, really.  And a bunch of people without the English accent talking about what could happen, what might  happen.  And then I finally find CNN.  And you have the English accent people from England talking about what they're seeing.  So I'd rather go to CNN.  Well, you know what I did on the way in?  I was also listening to the coverage on XM satellite. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, you were?  On Deep Tracks, Anthony.  On Deep Tracks.  And they went very deep into the story.  Did they play some Pink Floyd?  And it turns out that the tracks very deep in the ground were not affected.  Oh, Deep Tracks with subway systems.  Yeah.  See, I went the other way with that.  You zigged.  Meanwhile, Norton comes in here like, what happened?  Something in London?  No.  Yeah, you had no clue.  You had no idea.  I didn't.  Why would I walk in going, what happened?  Something in London.  Why don't you take over your shades? 
[00:16:30]  What?  It's raining.  It's the most overcast day.  He walks in.  And he walks in with shades at 6 in the morning.  Can't help it.  I want to be recognized and bothered.  You know how it is.  Somebody on the street.  Fancy and popular.  Colin just looks at her and goes, it's raining out and it's nighttime.  He's just jealous because he can't find sunglasses that fit around that fat skull.  Shut up, you dinosaur little baby pinhead.  Dino Spot's head.  He was just destroying you before you got here.  I know.  There's nothing worse than when you walk in and you look in the glass and you see stupid  Colin leaning and then you two just laughing and looking as I walk in. 
[00:17:00]  You know it's not here comes our friend Jimmy Norton.  Colin made it okay to have a big head today.  Because obviously he has a big head.  But he's like, yeah, I don't have a big head.  Who cares?  And then he decides to talk about how awful your head is.  It's cute.  It's a small head, though.  He said he has a little, what did you say?  A little baby head.  A pinhead.  Dino.  He looks like Dino from the Flintstones.  He's got spots like Dino on his head.  I happen to resent that.  Why don't you get those colored in?  Different colors on the liver spots. 
[00:17:30]  Come on.  Don't you have a U.S. air flight to catch to Vegas?  The biggest insult of all from this idiot because he goes out every gig with that serious mock, serious tone.  Like, is that worried about him?  Continental.  It's kind of a continental.  Or I'm not going.  Youngest fleet in the nation.  Yes.  Well, next to JetBlue.  But I'm talking to the majors, of course.  I'm talking to the majors.  The ones you can get first class in also.  Absolutely.  JetBlue.  All, you know, everything's fine and dandy with JetBlue, but try to get a first class seat.  I hope this is not taking the wrong way, but I hope you're on a continental flight and you get blown to smithereens. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  Colin, we'll probably all be sharing that flight.  Yes.  No, you won't.  Unless you're being blown in a good way.  Some chick just leans over.  I enjoy you.  Oh, Colin sent me.  Oh, look, bark.  Gets a mouthful of smithereens.  Did I tell you about that?  You want to hear a first?  Did I tell you guys about that?  I swear to you, and this is not, I'm not making it up. 
[00:18:30]  About a month ago, I go to LaGuardia.  The lady checking me is wearing like a, not like a burka, but like an Islamic top.  Oh, boy.  She's reading a book, I promise, I swear on anybody, my mother, she's reading a book that says,  while she's checking, women and Islamic law regarding fatwa, fatwa, the death warrant.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  Is that hilarious?  You are kidding.  No, I swear to God.  How is she allowed to do that?  That is alarming the passengers.  That would alarm the passengers. 
[00:19:00]  That's amazing.  I know.  Like she's not going to let a few things slide, perhaps.  You know what a fatwa.  Can't you read Louis Grizzard?  Yeah.  Well, that other famous Islamic book, Clits and Why They're Overrated.  How to dig them out with a spade shovel.  That's horrific.  Oh, that's cool.  Wow, that would, uh, I wonder if somebody said something to her.  After you, of course, you're just as big a pussy as we are. 
[00:19:30]  I was like, oh, la, la, la, la.  You should have said something.  I'm like, hey, you still got on that flight, though, I bet.  I sure as heck did, because I figured, what are the odds?  What are the odds?  If we stopped getting on?  They stopped the guy in front of me, because they said, no smoking, sir.  He said, leave my shoes out of this.  Fatwa.  Do you think Bruce Kelly's crying over the bombing?  No.  No, he's crying over the who.  He's hoping the who is okay.  They weren't in the subway or on the bus. 
[00:20:00]  Something like that.  As long as the magic bus is okay.  That didn't blow up, right?  By the way, I hope someone pointed out that we blew it yesterday.  First of all, we don't even remember being here.  I don't remember the last hour of the show, and I'm not kidding.  We really don't.  I was so goddamn tired.  We shouldn't take four days off in a row.  I mean, we had the weekend and then a couple of extra days.  It just throws us into the regular schedule thing again.  Anthony admitted to me in the back office.  He goes, dude, I don't even remember the last hour of the show.  I got up and walked to the parking garage. 
[00:20:30]  When I was on the sidewalk, I'm walking, and I was in such a daze.  I got passed walking by one of those shuffling homeless guys with a big backpack on that do like .1 mile per hour down the sidewalk.  I couldn't move.  By the way, can I say one thing about the homeless on this block?  Yes.  That fat idiot on the corner.  He's been there for like two years.  The guy with the big potbelly sticking out of his shirt.  He's right under the thing.  Yeah.  One day, I'm walking there with a woman, and he goes, Saturday night dead. 
[00:21:00]  He heckles me while he's home.  You were heckled by that guy?  And I go, fuck you, you fat pig.  I'm yelling back at a homeless fat guy.  Fuck you, you fat pig.  You got a heckle of my homeless guy.  Saturday night dead.  He yells it at me as I'm walking by.  Ray, you motherfucker.  It's the middle of the day.  He had no shirt on.  He was fat.  It was hot.  We love our homeless around here.  They're classic.  That guy's laying down there today.  His pants were down so low, you could see the fat over his dick, his upper dick fat was 
[00:21:30]  hanging out of the top of his pants.  And then, for some reason, it's a big thing for everyone to hose down the sidewalks here  in the city in the morning.  So, one guy was bringing the hose out, and the hose just went right over the guy, and  the guy with the hose didn't even care.  Like, he just pulled the hose.  It went right over the sleeping homeless guy with the big gut.  Speaking of, that defines New York right there.  They just don't care.  Yeah, they care more about their stupid sidewalk than...  Clean it off.  ...in a homeless person a lot.  Holds him down. 
[00:22:00]  Speaking of fat guts, hanging out.  We went to visit Robert Kelly last night.  He was pretty fat.  Ah, how's Bob?  How's his leg?  He's in bad shape, but it was funny.  On stage last night, because he slammed me, and then I slammed him, but while he was  being slamming Bob Kelly on stage, he goes, yeah, he's just laying there like a fat  Hawaiian.  I want to go to his house and shove an apple on his fat pig mouth.  No, we visited him.  He did look pretty fat.  He did look pretty fat.  He has a haircut, like a sling blade haircut.  I swear to God.  It's really the worst haircut I've ever seen. 
[00:22:30]  He just had that little bit on the back, like a weird...  Yeah, I heard that Colin was telling us that he was kind of like doing you on stage last  night at the cellar or something.  Yeah.  I was doing the pretentious pause, the profound teacher on stage.  The profound teacher.  Yeah, it's gone a little bit far now.  And then when he went up, idiotically, he hadn't watched my set, which is bad.  As a comedian, he should be studying the master.  Why would I?  I wanted to stay awake. 
[00:23:00]  And then when he went up, he actually did it even worse than usual.  He goes, I've been...  I've been...  Lately, I've moved to a new apartment.  And it's like, the crowd's like, you know, time is money.  These are 10 minutes sets.  We paid for a certain finite amount.  And a new apartment.  It's like, oh.  Then he started slamming me, and they loved it.  He started imitating me on stage, going...  I just leaned against the wall and mumbled. 
[00:23:30]  The self-important idiot who you couldn't quite understand, but you knew he was saying something  remotely funny.  No, see, but I'm self-important, but at least I'm hurrying through my set.  You're standing there like...  You know, breathing in the air.  You know what I mean?  Like you're standing on a balcony in some South American dictatorship.  You know, people.  You really are becoming a pompous ass.  I have to pause when I'm testing material.  I always go very, very slow.  Actually, I do it.  Yeah.  I don't know how you do it, but that's how I do it.  Ooh.  Nice and slow. 
[00:24:00]  Ooh.  I missed that one, damn it.  Still very funny.  You never get out at night.  What?  I never...  I would love just to watch the shenanigans that take place between new characters.  Well, I always know...  That's the fun times.  When I'm going on after him, and I walk through the bathroom, I walk through the club last night,  and he's like, ugh!  And the crowd just laughs.  I'm like, all right, I know there was some shit talking going on.  Because they all know us by now.  Of course.  So when I walk on after him, I'm like, was he bad-mouthing me?  And the whole crowd's like, yes! 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, they rat him out right away.  No loyalty.  Hey, the listeners want the craziest updates on this show.  Let's go to Charlie the Trucker.  Charlie, you need an update.  Yeah, say, I was wondering whatever happened to that turd that's sitting in the corner of the parking garage.  Ah, the homeless turd.  Yeah, I was keeping track of this thing.  About, I guess, it's been probably four months now, when I went to the parking garage one day,  there was a fresh, big log that a homeless guy had just taken a dump right there. 
[00:25:00]  And you could tell what he did when the garage, the big grate, the big door in front of the garage was shut.  When they were closed, they closed that door.  He used that to prop his back against and take the dump kind of in the corner.  So, as I'm walking in, I look, and it's fresh.  It's right there, and you could tell it's not an animal.  Well, it is an animal, but of the human variety.  And it was there.  So, now, for four months, I've been looking at it every day and watching it decompose 
[00:25:30]  to the point where it just turned into this dry, almost paper-looking, like onion paper shredded type of thing.  And I've got to tell you, whoever asked that question, needing this turd-on-the-street update,  it is pretty much now just fragments, little pieces of it, that are sitting there waiting to just blow away with the wind.  Just the string remains.  The string?  That was very poetic, though.  Yeah, there was nothing.  It's almost like charred corn husk is laying there now. 
[00:26:00]  And that's just the stringy materials left from that fine meal that I'm sure he grabbed out of a dumpster somewhere.  That's it.  We've got lots to do today on the show.  Paul Field and his wife are coming in to do the news at 8 a.m.  Isn't he an English gentleman?  Yes, he is.  Maybe he can have some insight on this story out of England.  He and his wife do all my merchandise, and they're very, very capable, qualified people.  Yeah.  It'll be awful.  No dipping into the till with them? 
[00:26:30]  You can trust them?  Yeah, no, no, I think that they're pretty legit.  Yeah?  Yeah, let's hope so.  It's a pretty wild business, that t-shirt and video and stuff like that.  Well, not my merchandise.  It's pretty simple.  I don't know.  T-shirts.  You know, money's made, money's given to you.  Who knows where some of it goes, perhaps.  It's all done out of an account, all out of a PayPal account.  We both go into the same account.  It is.  I have a complete list of all transactions, and I think they're very honest.  I'm not accusing them.  Let's hope.  I'm not accusing them.  I'm just saying, you know, you've got to watch yourself.  I've sold according to that. 
[00:27:00]  You've got to be honest than you selling that drivel.  What?  It was very accurate.  That you call merchandise implies a necessity.  It happens to be very, very popular stuff.  I can't help it.  Look, you want to go to eatabullet.com or jimnorton.net?  Can't go to jimnorton.com because of the slopes that fucking own it in Hong Kong.  You stop leaving me alone.  I am off as you eat.  That's who owns it?  Hong Kong?  Yeah, it was some guy in Florida that had jimnorton.com.  I talked to Bob yesterday, and he did what he could.  It was just, and it was bought by these fucking cyber squatters in Asia, and I just, I fucking 
[00:27:30]  hate them.  Why would they buy jimnorton?  Because they're awful, savage, rotten people, and that's what they do.  They buy jimnorton.  They bought my name.  We buy jimnorton.  Yeah.  How are everybody locking?  They probably thought it was the steakhouse, those fucking non-English-speaking dummies.  Look, guys, I've got to get out of here.  I've got to catch my flight.  I've got to go.  But thanks for ruining my big serious radio thing.  It was infinity.  I made a mistake.  It was infinity I had a meeting with.  Okay.  But they broke it off anyway. 
[00:28:00]  What are you going to be, David Lee Roth's sidekick?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, Diamond.  I'm going to call him.  Diamond Dave.  The Diamond and Colin show.  Rumor is Diamond Dave taking over for Howard on K-Rock in New York.  That will be a disaster.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, exactly.  Shut up.  I was telling Colin in the back office, like, these guys that are celebrities to begin with  that go on a radio, they don't understand what they're getting into.  They think it's easy.  And then when you start realizing you've got to come up with 20 hours of original material 
[00:28:30]  a week, you probably have a great time.  You completely lose it.  You probably have a great time thinking this is going to be the greatest, easiest gig ever.  And then a week goes by, two weeks, and you're going, wait, I've got to still do this?  Right.  I thought, like, you know, I had two weeks, I came up with stuff, and now what, I've got  to come up with more every day?  And your listeners don't care if you had a great show, because now you have to worry  about tomorrow.  No.  They'll be telling old Van Halen stories and bad-mouthing Sammy Hagar.  Dan, dan, dan, dan. 
[00:29:00]  We should get a list of celebrities that try to do radio, and you'll see it's just a disaster,  an absolute disaster.  David Lee Roth can talk, though, like, he's one guy who can just yap, I've seen him at  the cellar, he can go.  So he might have a shot compared to most of them.  I've interviewed him over the years, he's very entertaining.  No.  Are you guys going to do it?  No.  No.  First of all, let me explain one thing to you about comedy, principle one, nobody wants  to hear your positive, uplifting message.  Exactly.  You know, something nasty to say, shut your trap.  Anyway, guys, as I was saying, Sirius is very serious, ma, about me, and Infinity, 
[00:29:30]  well, there was Infinity, so it wasn't Sirius.  It was the wrong network, I don't know what goes on in the world.  Wow.  It's the wrong technology, dummy.  Yeah.  You were off by 80 years.  What?  What happened?  Satellite.  All right, let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I'm not sure, just wondering whatever happened, but Paul the pilot.  I guess we're doing random updates today, Anthony.  What did happen to Paul?  We know he was in a pretty bad car wreck, but he pulled through it. 
[00:30:00]  He was in a horrific car wreck.  He was in a coma for a very long time, and he ended up calling us saying he's okay, and  that he was going to fly again.  Yeah.  I hadn't heard anything.  And we were getting email from people basically saying the guy wasn't going to make it.  Yeah.  But one day, he did call us out of the blue, and it sounded like he was doing much better  and that he was planning on flying again.  And that was the last one he heard.  What are we going to see some wild battles again?  Ah, well, we'll have to try to hunt him down, sir.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  Thanks a lot.  All right, Dave.  Punching out.  Colin, do you want to just leave again?  Yeah, I'm leaving.  Guys, take care of yourselves.  Thank you.  It's my last time on.  I've got my new Infinity Radio show.  Colin's like when Frank used to show up on Carson.  Yeah.  You know, he'd just pop in, sit on the couch, talk a little, and then you think he's going  to just slide over?  Yeah.  And let, like, George Goebel sit down and have an interview?  No, he's getting up, he's leaving.  He's too busy.  He's got things to do.  I've got a flight to go.  I'm opening at the Sands. 
[00:31:00]  I've got to go to the farm.  I've got a big gig.  Yeah.  He's in the middle of filming a movie.  He's got to go right there and there.  He's got to go.  Yeah.  Norton's like Frank, too.  Frank Gorshin, that is.  Dead.  That's exactly what you should leave on.  You'll rue today, you said that to me.  He's got his umbrella.  Look at him.  See you later.  That is the worst umbrella I've ever seen.  But it's a nice shirt in 1967.  Beat it, stupid.  That umbrella could cover a family of six as you're walking down the sidewalk.  What?  What's that? 
[00:31:30]  One of those assistants gave me an empty CD of those things I took yesterday.  An empty CD case?  Yeah.  What was the CD called?  Colin's Greatest Hits?  Beat it.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Beat it, kid.  There he goes.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Colin.  Colin was here.  We got in the office, I don't know, a quarter after six, and Colin was here.  He was already here.  I saw him last night, and he goes, I'm going to come in every day until it's uncomfortable.  Mission accomplished. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, he came in complaining that one of the CD cases, one of the DVD cases he took yesterday  was empty.  And the one that wasn't empty was shit, he said.  It wasn't very good.  That's classic.  You take free stuff and then complain about it once you get home.  Let's not forget, Colin will be at Caroline's next weekend.  Pat from Boston.  I think he just left the studio.  I wanted to ask Graywolf, what's up with Tippi Tom?  You think Colin sounds like Graywolf?  Do I?  Do I? 
[00:32:30]  Our homeless friend that has an unbelievable voice.  Yeah.  All right, thanks, bro.  You know, why don't we play that going into break?  Graywolf.  I wish that was longer.  I actually like that a lot.  Yeah, that's a really good song.  Graywolf is a homeless guy, and he was singing a song about Tippi Tom, who's a homeless gay  guy with AIDS.  Only on this show.  And made it sound beautiful.  I got it.  So, uh...  And Drew Boogie mixed it.  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  I gave Graywolf all the credit for that one. 
[00:33:00]  Actually, Drew Boogie, yeah, made this into a song with music in the background and stuff,  because Graywolf just sang it a cappella or whatever.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, Drew Boogie threw the whole thing together and made it sound like a real  song.  And we were talking about the homeless and stuff in this break, so why don't we...  Sure.  Why don't we go to break with this little ditty?  Yeah, you.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got it right now.  I'm going to break with this.  Oh, this is nice. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yo.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night, but his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through his train station, and I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Sippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, yo.  Oh, yo.  Oh, yo.  Just laid that night, and now you have no fear to go. 
[00:34:00]  My money's gone and off to all my friends, and the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here, and he says, and you don't have an angel, and he says, that angel.  We have no fear to go.  Shelter to me from the falling rain. 
[00:34:30]  You have no fear to go.  You have no fear to go.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter to me from the falling rain.  This is my life, I'm living with so much pain, that's just a little piece. 
[00:35:00]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  News teases, not even a news tease, just your local news just getting, this is what we're  looking for from the rest of the country, your local news getting wacky, your local news  scaring the shit out of you with their teases, yeah, anything else, and anything else out  of the ordinary, I guess. 
[00:35:30]  Right now, on the Insider and Entertainment Tonight.  Two teenagers attack, is it the work of one killer shark?  Get ready to be an insider.  Could there be a real-life Jaws on the loose?  Latest on young Craig, as little Jamie is about to be laid to rest.  I'm a shark, Betsy.  I just want to eat your pussy.  I want you to bite Betsy's leg off and swim around with her blood all over your snout. 
[00:36:00]  If you like this idea, just don't evolve for 60 million years.  I just want to take my mouth and latch on you like a pilot fish.  I just want to latch on underneath your lip and eat your scraps.  I normally don't do this, but I don't know.  Let's just go fucking crazy.  Let's just eat the Kintner boy.  Let's just have a license plate in their stomachs.  I just want to put on a suit jacket with anchors on it and close the beaches. 
[00:36:30]  If you're into this, bite some Italian guy's leg off with a perfectly tied sneaker on it.  I just want to go fucking crazy.  If you like this, just look at me and roll back your eyes and your feet.  I'll do drugs.  I'll drink to your leg. 
[00:37:00]  Come on.  But you got to act like you're into Robert Shaw.  You got to act like you're into Robert Shaw.  Stupid Pat O'Brien.  He's the worst.  I love that.  O.B. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Are you breathing?  Are you breathing?  Now, now, wake up. 
[00:37:30]  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the refugees.  Now, someone is going to die.  When you listen to me, listen to me, die.  Listen to me, die.  Say, wake up.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the refugees.  Now, someone is going to die.  When you listen to me, listen to me, die.  Listen to me, die.  Say, are you breathing?  All right.  We got lots going on today.  Paul's here with his lovely bride, Paul Field, and his wife are doing the news today.  Why, I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  Why not?  I don't know.  Well, report coming in on Fox News Alert.  Group claims attacks in the name of Al-Qaeda.  Of course.  Our old pals, Al-Qaeda.  Yeah, always making life fun with their little unplanned attacks.  Well, London has such a problem there, too, because all these radical clerics,  because they have a huge Muslim population.  Yes, they do. 
[00:38:30]  A lot of people don't know that.  These radical clerics, like Richard Reed, the shoe bomber from American Airlines in Paris,  was from Britain.  There's a lot of them are from Britain, and these radical clerics always find a sanctuary there  because there's such a huge following.  Yeah.  So hopefully England will start really cracking down there.  Crack down like we do.  Don't listen to the people that are whining that these people aren't being treated nicely.  Do what you've got to do to protect your law-abiding citizens.  Are they saying 90 deaths in that one location?  No, 90 casualties.  I think that right now all they're saying is two confirmed dead. 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  I think that bus looks like it's just shredded.  So I'm sure that death count will go up.  And that's just at one location.  They said two casualties and 90 injured and two dead.  Right.  Let's say hi to Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark, what's up?  Anthony, Timmy.  Hey.  How's it going there, old Jerry Schiavo Cohen?  I was wondering, when we had the bombings here in Oklahoma City, you guys were talking about the news thing there. 
[00:39:30]  You guys had the 9-11 thing happen.  I swear to God, every day it seemed like they were saying, can it happen again?  Just scaring the shit out of everybody here.  Well, we're going to start taping our local news because I guarantee in New York they're going to ask everyone, is our subway safe here in New York City?  And I sent your racial collectible to you guys last week.  Hopefully you'll be getting it this week.  It's just that Ken's sign. 
[00:40:00]  It says, Picaninny Watermelon Ice Cream.  Oh, yeah.  I remember talking about that last week.  And, Jimmy, do you want a Pat Battle movie sequence?  Oh, Pat Battle movie what?  A Pat Battle movie sequence.  What is that?  Yeah.  Or, you know, when you say you put Pat Battle in the movie.  Anyway, sorry about that.  People have got something so good there.  Sorry about that.  That's what we should do today.  Yeah.  How is your city going to tie into this? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, somehow.  New York is obvious, you know.  Subway and buses, they're going to be talking about the security.  Bless you all.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  I hope you brought up a pretty good point in the office, too, saying, and it's almost  awful, but it's very human.  Watching it on TV, and it's not the magnitude that the 9-11 attacks were, but you're kind  of like, eh.  I hope he goes, this is kind of easy to watch, you know?  I mean, it's not as, when it's not your country and your city, you kind of watch like it's 
[00:41:00]  a news story.  It's terrible and everything, but you don't get that personal effect that you got when  it was planes crashing, you know, around the corner from you.  Yeah, because it turned out we knew a lot of the people that died.  Simple as that.  When you see it overseas, you're like, oh, wow.  God, look at that.  It really sucks, but you don't have that, like, underlying fear within your own body.  Yeah.  Obviously, this could happen again in New York.  I know that, but the feeling that you were fucked with, you know?  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Like that, it's kind of like, oh, wow, that's pretty bad.  All right.  It's England.  It's kind of different when it's someone else, I guess.  Yeah.  The rest of the world was more scared than we are.  Like, when they saw it happen, like, the U.S. get hit, they were, because Patrice  was over in England, I think, and he was saying that they were afraid that Bush was going  to drop nuclear weapons.  I mean, the whole world was fucking really panicking.  We should have.  Right.  Yeah, I'd love that.  All right, let's go to Adam in the Bronx.  Adam, go ahead.  Good morning, fellas.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hiya.  Morning.  What's up, Adam?  Why am I not a fella? 
[00:42:00]  I just wanted to make a point that not only is the media going to make it a local story,  what they're going to do is they're going to let all the terrorists and everybody know  exactly how to get into the system and make it happen.  You know, they always do that.  They make it so easy for them by letting all of us know how they're going to do it and how  they're going to do it.  The news is classic for that, you know.  Some homemade bomb happens to go off in some school somewhere or whatever, and then they  pretty much show you how it was done.  And they'll do, like, we sent our reporter with this suitcase, and it was left unattended on 
[00:42:30]  a train for hours.  This could have been a bomb.  Oh, thanks.  Great.  We all know, first of all, that our rail systems are just fucked.  Amtrak?  How many people ride Amtrak on a daily base, take that commuter thing to Washington, to  Boston?  It's got to be 300 or 400 people.  Good point.  You know, I might say maybe even a couple more.  But there is zero security. 
[00:43:00]  Zero.  Who doesn't know this?  You take something on board, one of those trains, a suitcase, is it ever looked at?  Is your suitcase ever looked at?  No.  No.  I hate saying it, but it's not like, you know, I'm not breaking any new ground here.  Are you trying to say, like, you can buy a ticket to Washington, get on in New York,  and then maybe throw the suitcase up above, and then maybe get off in Philly?  There you go.  How about that, huh?  Without your suitcase?  Does anyone keep tabs on luggage and who's coming and going with it, whether they're 
[00:43:30]  getting off a train and leaving luggage on?  No one keeps tabs on any of the luggage on Amtrak.  Or maybe they have some secret security we don't know about.  There ain't no secret.  Yeah, just like the missile, anti-plane missile batteries that are on the rooftops, all the  buildings we all heard about.  Remember that old gag?  Oh, man.  You know, it's got all kinds of anti-aircraft stuff on tops of buildings.  If any time any plane tries to get in or a missile or something, they shoot it down.  Yeah.  Sure they will. 
[00:44:00]  That didn't work too well.  All right.  So that's what's going to happen with the local stories today.  Oklahoma City will have the Will It Happen Again here.  I wonder if they could tie in any other cities today.  If you got one, you call the show, all right?  They'll talk to people in Oklahoma City, and they'll be saying,  Oh, it brought back such bad memories watching the news today from London.  Yeah.  They love that local angle.  Well, I guess London was too busy trying to get the Olympics.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Boy, they were so jubilant yesterday, and now it looks like they had their guard down a little bit.  I wonder if that would have happened specifically in London, or I wonder if they had that planned  for whoever got the Olympics.  That's what we sort of said in the office.  No way.  If they could have blown up Paris, New York, and London at the same time, you'd think that  Al-Qaeda's just going, Oh, well, they got the Olympics.  Well, all right, take the bombs out of New York and London and Paris.  You're probably right. 
[00:45:00]  I'd say maybe they had a plan ready for all three.  Whoever got the Olympics was going to get hit, and the other ones are going to get hit,  obviously, in a different way.  They seem to operate.  What, like at 8 o'clock Eastern time?  No, no, I don't think it's going to happen today.  No?  They're saying that this is very similar to the Madrid bombings.  That's why they're pointing the finger there at Al-Qaeda.  Yeah, that's what we know so far.  Oh, this is, I remember this.  Just keep talking about how we're treating them poorly at Guantanamo, and how we're flushing 
[00:45:30]  a Koran down the toilet.  Just keep bringing all that up, and this will keep happening.  It's great stuff.  Let's go to premarital sex from whackbag.com.  A fine, open Anthony message board.  What's up, premarital sex?  Hey, do you guys remember the time the, remember, Geraldo Rivera got booted off MSNBC for basically,  you know, he drew out like our American military operation plans in the sand, like how we were  going to attack the, uh...  Yeah, he was like, kind of telling what the positions of the soldiers were. 
[00:46:00]  The media is just ridiculous in general, and that's why, once again, we love the assaults  on the media, and making a mockery of what they do, because they're a bunch of scumbags.  Exactly, and I plan to do a few more, you know, to join that contest, you guys are holding  this month.  Oh yeah, we should talk about that.  The best assault on the media in the month of July is getting a My Fine, some other fine  prizes still to be named.  Yes.  Do we have anyone that has officially done one since announcing the contest, Anthony?  Well, we have quite a few contestants.  We have a guy named Danny, a guy named Nathaniel. 
[00:46:30]  Well, the problem is, Danny's now an employee of the Opie and Anthony show, or he would be  in the lead.  Or employees aren't allowed to do assaults on the media.  We had an assault on the media yesterday on the Today Show, behind Matt and Katie.  Yes.  That was a very good one.  It was.  Thank you, premarital sex.  Well, all I want to say is that me and Boston Struggler are ready for battle.  All right, good luck to you guys.  Watch out, man.  The other thing is, what was the other story where we were invading, and the TV crews were 
[00:47:00]  waiting for them on the beach as they were coming ashore?  Someone help me.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And all the news crews were set up on the beach.  It was supposed to be some kind of surprise attack, more or less, and they had all the  TV lights on and everything to get the first shots of the...  I think it was in Haiti, Iwo Jima.  Iwo Jima.  It might have been when there was some unrest there in Haiti, and there were soldiers going  to rescue some of the people that were Americans that were there. 
[00:47:30]  I'm not sure.  It was one of those Caribbean...  But they figured out where the troops were going to land, and they had all their TV crews  set up on the beach.  Oh, Jimmy knows.  Bay of Pigs.  Bay of Pigs, right.  That's what it was.  And they were standing there with their dicks in their hand, and there were a lot of pissed  off people, Mr. Garrison.  Yeah, they actually...  We always do this stuff at night, American troops, because we can see in the dark.  It's amazing.  We rule.  And they were coming up, and all of a sudden the press has all their lights on, and they're 
[00:48:00]  videotaping these soldiers hitting the beaches.  And they were being yelled at by the soldiers, and the soldiers were completely within their  right to just shoot these people.  They should have just shot them.  Bastards.  All right, let's go to Doug Out, Doug.  What's going on, guys?  Faithful listener of the program.  What's up, Doug?  If you guys want to do about 20, 25 minutes of radio this morning, go ahead and plunk up  the audio for Fox News Channel.  That woman doing the coverage of the London bombings is fear-mongering like you wouldn't 
[00:48:30]  fucking believe.  Already?  Well, Fox is the fear-monger network.  They just reported a preliminary report that the bus bomb was indeed a suicide bomber.  Can it happen here?  Did they say that, or did they say a homicide bomber, to be all politically correct?  You're right.  That's right.  That's right.  Fox News, it was a homicide bomber.  Homicide bomber.  Like, any bomb that goes off that the guy can be smoking a cigar somewhere in Cuba, it's 
[00:49:00]  a homicide bombing.  It is a difference.  Suicide bombing is when the guy kills himself doing it.  Stupid Fox.  Yeah, I know.  I hate that.  They're trying to rush hour already in D.C.  They're saying everybody needs to be on alert and on watch in D.C. and New York City for  rush hour.  Well, when did it happen?  Eight o'clock in London?  Eight o'clock London time?  Yeah, it was eight o'clock.  So, everybody, the big countdown for eight o'clock in all the major cities here? 
[00:49:30]  So, also, since it's completely impossible for me to do a totally serious call, Ben's  hog is so big, there's two dead and 90 wounded.  Punch it out.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm still worried about Y2K myself, Anthony.  Y2K, you know, some people, remember after Y2K, people were still worried, well, it could  happen days later, like the whole thing just fizzled out, but they couldn't stop trying  to scare you.  That was probably the greatest fear bust ever in the history of man.  Nothing. 
[00:50:00]  They got us all scared about Y2K.  Capone vault of fear, that was nothing.  And then we all counted down with good old Dick Clark.  I'm for me, for my family, and then we're all sitting there, all hammered on our champagne  and our marijuana cigarettes, our reefers, our reefer madness, and what happened with 
[00:50:30]  Y2K?  Absolutely nothing.  I'll tell you what happens.  I lost a fine joke.  You had a Y2K joke, did you?  One of the problems that they were saying was going to happen was that the computer systems  were going to backdate 100 years.  Yeah.  Because the old one flip, they would have went back to 1901.  1900.  And I said, that's going to be great.  It's going to help me in my big court case.  What are they going to do?  Prosecute me for having sex with a girl who's 114?  Yeah.  I want more.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:51:00]  That was a good one.  Wouldn't that make her younger?  Well, it didn't make perfect mathematical sense.  Yeah.  That would have happened.  Right when I got that, it's like if she was 14 in the year 2000, let's say, if it was  then 1900, she's not even born yet.  Well, let's be happy that you weren't in the audience.  For the three years I was doing it beforehand.  You never talk about Y2K since, you know, 1971.  Yes, they were.  Wow.  Glad I brought that up.  How will it affect your pong game?  We'll tell you.  1971? 
[00:51:30]  That was pretty good.  Let's say hi to Bill in Florida.  Bill?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That attack in the assault on the media, if you will, it was, I believe, in Somalia.  When they came on short, all the guys were waiting.  Oh, was it Somalia?  Yeah.  And that, you know, I think you're right.  They should have just started shooting at them.  That worked out well, too.  That whole operation worked out very well for America.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  That was us.  By the way, that was our last attempt at helping Africa.  So, yeah.  Good job. 
[00:52:00]  Let's say hi to one of our favorite Canadians, Anthony.  Mitch in Montreal.  Montreal.  Hey, Mitch.  Mitch in Montreal.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  We're doing fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're fine there, Mitch.  Yeah?  Hey.  How's it going there?  You're concerned about, like, the terrorism and stuff, hey?  We're not afraid of terrorists here because they all fucking live here.  They do?  Yeah.  Montreal was, after September 11th, they discovered that Montreal was one of the biggest safe havens 
[00:52:30]  for terrorists in the world because of Canadians' lax laws for immigration.  Right.  Canadians.  And it still is.  So, anyone who's in the U.S., I'd like to tell you, if you come to visit beautiful Montreal  and you take a taxi, I'd say a 1 in 25 chance you're going to be being driven around by a terrorist.  Well, same here.  New York cabs?  No.  Because in New York, you have something called security. 
[00:53:00]  You know, our border guards at the Canadian border do not have guns.  Did you realize that?  You ever cross the border?  You guys don't know how to use guns yet.  Yeah.  When's the last time we shoot out with terrorist suspects at the border anyway?  They sneak through.  And you know something, my friend?  Your border guards are in the same place our border guards are.  So, I don't care what's slipping into your country.  We care what's coming into here.  And as long as our guys have guns and aren't afraid to use them, I feel better.  Just admit it.  You guys stink. 
[00:53:30]  We suck so bad that I wish you'd drop a nuclear bomb here.  Just call me a week before and let me move and just blow us all out of the fucking...  Mitch used to be rah-rah about his country.  I know.  This is what I love about satellite radio.  We could change your minds in fucking weeks.  Poor Mitch.  I'm stuck here, guys.  They're just handing terrorist Molson at the border.  Hey, I have a Molson, eh?  Yeah.  You're right.  It's all about it.  Yeah, who's Mr. Akbar?  Where's he?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Enjoy the sight.  You could see a moose.  Do you guys want to hear something funny?  What?  All right.  Hold on.  Something funny?  Hold on.  Are you guys ready for something funny?  All right.  I'm putting on my laughing hat.  All right.  I like to get ready before I hear something funny.  I put on my laughing hat, and I'm using...  I never do this.  I'm using the chin strap for it.  Because it might just fly off my head.  So let me buckle it up.  I already got a little funny in me.  All right.  Well, I'm buckling it on this time.  Because usually, I don't have to worry about it flying off.  But this guy...  This has got to be funny. 
[00:54:30]  Wait.  Why doesn't mine have a strap like that?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Because you have no chin.  I just felt like being Captain Obvious today.  Oh, yeah.  You did.  All right.  Go ahead, Mitch.  Okay.  I have a little...  I own a garage.  Not yet?  I just like the way he said garage.  Wait, Mitch.  What's funny about owning a garage?  Well, I had a custom...  We specialize in air conditioning.  I had a taxi driver come in, an Al-Qaeda cab driver come in.  And he didn't want to pay his bill. 
[00:55:00]  And I sort of...  So I bit him.  So I gave him a beer, eh?  And he was off now.  So...  He threatened to grab me.  He says...  Because I called him a motherfucker.  And he threatened to grab me.  And he said,  I will hold you until you cry like a little child in my country.  You know what we do to people like you?  You will disappear.  You will cry like a little child in my arms.  And that's what he did. 
[00:55:30]  And that's not so funny.  And have the car crash come in right now.  I'll see the car crash.  That's not the funny part.  That's not the funny part, though.  I didn't get the funny part yet.  Oh.  Okay.  What was it?  The funny part?  Wow.  I didn't get the funny part was then I got upset because I don't like to be threatened, 
[00:56:00]  you know?  Especially from terrorists.  So I called the cops.  And the cops came down and they were going to arrest him.  And he told the cops that since I called him a motherfucker with such a big insult from  his country that I should be given a ticket.  That's what he told them.  And believe it or not, these ignorant Quebec cops, they had told me if I want, I can press  charges, have them arrested.  Mitch. 
[00:56:30]  But it's my fault.  Mitch.  It's pretty loud.  A lot of our regulars are bombing today, by the way.  Wow, Mitch.  There's a thing that happens here.  I see all the phones that Danny screens from the other room.  And I see Mitch in Montreal.  And I'm like, Mitch is a lot of fun on the show.  We go back and forth a little bit.  We get some laughs out of Mitch.  We make fun of him a little bit.  I've got to tell you, man.  My appearance today was awful.  So the next time I see Mitch on the screen, I don't know if I'm going to go to it.  No. 
[00:57:00]  That's how it works around here.  Doug out Doug.  We still go to his phone call.  Yes.  That guy, Mark, from Oklahoma City, he did the same thing to us today.  He stunk on ice.  Joe from Whack Bag is saying, the only way this story can end funny is if his mother  gets AIDS and dies.  How did they know that?  Now, that's funny.  Can I not call back anymore, guys?  I'll call back, Mitch, but just make sure you have a little more admonition.  That's right.  Okay, I'm sorry, guys.  I didn't mean to slow down the show.  That's right.  Slow down.  You hit a wall with it, but that's all right.  Mitch, you call back any time you want, because we love making fun of you. 
[00:57:30]  That's right.  Okay, I'm sorry, guys.  Mitch.  I'm depressed now.  Nah, let it go.  Let it go.  I'm going to go kick a Frenchman.  Mitch.  I'm going to go kick a Frenchman.  That's it.  I'm going to go find a Frenchman to kick.  Oh, we heard it the first two times it bombed.  I like the way EBG reversed it.  I'm going to go kick a Frenchman.  No one heard it.  I'm going to go kick a Frenchman.  Oh, they didn't like the order.  I'm going to go find a Frenchman to kick.  All right.  Left him out sooner or later here in Montreal.  Montreal.  Now they're saying at least seven explosions reported. 
[00:58:00]  They don't even know.  They don't even know.  Mitch.  Thank you.  Okay.  Sorry, guys.  I'm on a date with Carla Homolka.  Times have changed.  Our kids are getting worse.  They won't obey their parents.  They just want to fight and curse.  Should we blame the government or blame society?  Or should we blame the images on TV?  No.  Blame Canada. 
[00:58:30]  Blame Canada.  With all their beady little eyes and clapping heads so full of lies.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  We need to form a full assault.  You need to form a full assault.  Don't blame me for my son Stan.  He saw the darn cartoon and now he's off to join the clan.  And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf.  But now when I see him, he tells me to fuck myself.  Well, blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along. 
[00:59:00]  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  They're not even a real country anyway.  My son could have been a doctor or a lawyer, Richard Drew.  He said he burned a black-a-peggy on a barbecue.  Should we blame the matches?  Should we blame the fire?  Or the doctors who were loud and you'd inspire?  Heck no!  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  With all the hockey hummer below.  And that bitch Ed Murray too.  Blame Canada.  Shame on Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada. 
[00:59:30]  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Blame Canada.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  They went down to the CBS FM Oldies Rally, Anthony.  You see that one sign that was down there?  Ben's hog is so big, there's still snow on it in the summertime. 
[01:00:00]  Ha ha, I got that email, too.  That guy, how long is that email?  I saw one.  Ben's hog is so big it has casters.  The fact that this guy took whoever it is, I mean, how many pages is that thing?  Like ten pages?  Ben's hog is so big he has to call it Mr. Ben's hog in front of company.  Ha ha.  Ben's hog is so big it won't return Spielberg's calls.  Ben's hog is so big it graduated a year ahead of him from high school.  Ben's hog is so big, there was once a movie called Godzilla vs. Ben's hog. 
[01:00:30]  This is what we're going to do all day.  Ben's hog is so big it has an elevator and a lobby.  Ben's hog is so big it votes.  Ben's hog is no big, no big.  It's so big no matter where Ben goes, his hog always gets there first.  The one above that's even funnier.  Ben's hog is so big, Hank Aaron used it, it hit his 750th home run.  Ben's hog was once the ambassador to China. 
[01:01:00]  Ben's hog is so big it has investors.  Ben's hog is so big it has feets it.  Ben's hog is so big it has an opening act.  Ben's hog is so big it has its own Wheaties box.  Hawk, do you want to read one?  Why don't you read one?  The inside of Ben's hog contains billions and billions of stars. 
[01:01:30]  Ben's hog is so big it has elbows.  Ben's hog is so big that we're all a part of it and it's a part of all of us.  Ben's hog is so big it violates 17 zoning laws.  That's a good one, that's funny.  Ben's hog is so big it has stairs up the center like the Statue of Liberty.  Ben, you want to read one?  No, Ben.  I saw last night.  No time.  Talk about CBS FM.  I'm wrong.  Please. 
[01:02:00]  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right.  We're getting ready for some news.  We had a lot of fun with this bit and it kind of died. 
[01:02:30]  We're going to bring it back, I guess.  Just ordinary people from all walks of life doing the news for us.  Today it's Paul Field and his wife.  We don't even know who Paul Field is, but he's going to do the news.  He's one of Jimmy's friends that Jimmy forces on everybody else.  All I know is I ended up in a sushi restaurant with him and his wife and you and I think  it was my brother.  And this guy is like one of the most racist guys I've ever met in my life. 
[01:03:00]  Well, it wasn't Brett, it was Quinn.  Quinn?  Quinn.  Talking about the blacks.  Wow.  And there happened to be some blacks in the sushi restaurant.  And even Jimmy.  Was he using that term?  The blacks?  I don't know.  He was just really loud.  He's just really loud.  He's not racist.  We all say stupid shit, but most people look around and see who's around.  I see my windows rolled up tight.  This guy doesn't care who's hearing him. 
[01:03:30]  He is the loudest person.  Right?  Yeah, and he can't hear us right now.  So, my favorite thing about him is that he's British, but he can't say his THs.  He says them as Fs.  So, if you ask him a question like, how old was Christ when he died?  He'll say 33.  33!  Like that?  Like that?  Because some English people do have that kind of wacky speech thing.  I thought Christ was 27.  No, no, no, no.  He was 27 when he finally got into the Union.  The opium, Anthony.  Anthony.  Is it like Cockney accent? 
[01:04:00]  I don't know.  That he's got where they talk like this and say, oh, I don't give a fuck if he's 33 or not.  They do that like, fuff, fuff.  Every, uh, TH is a F?  I don't know.  And everything?  Just try to get him to say a lot of words with TH.  Yeah, let's do that.  I gotta put my shades on.  That's what I do radio from now on.  I see that.  But if you want to make people laugh, you should do it upside down.  You should put your glasses on upside down.  Yeah, and then no one ever get anything done.  Every time you talk, you'll look over and a fucking big gig will come out.  I'm laughing.  All right, before we get to the news with Paul Field and his wife, they're preparing. 
[01:04:30]  Paul Field is his real last name.  What did I say?  I'm kidding.  I said Field.  Oh.  Oh.  Is it Field or Fields?  Field.  Just Field.  No S.  It's Paul.  I don't care.  Oh, I tried.  All right, Anthony.  Field.  Before we get into the news, a lot of great things in the news today, by the way.  I hope he has the Britney Spears story.  Ooh.  They're starting to say that Britney Spears is going to have twins. 
[01:05:00]  Holy shit.  Oh.  Just ravaged the body.  That's a great career move.  Just ravaged that body.  Your whole career depends on being really hot.  Go get knocked up with twins.  That's brilliant.  I like it.  Jesus.  You were talking about her tits in the office.  Yep, yep.  Saw a picture of her yesterday.  As pregnant as she is.  By the way, why are we even doing a radio show anymore?  Why?  Everything we talk about on the radio is about what we're talking about in the office.  So shouldn't we just be rolling tape in the office? 
[01:05:30]  And then we wouldn't have to, like, tell all this stuff again.  Well, hopefully, when people leave and this is all cleared out, we can do that.  We can just turn on whatever recording equipment we're lounging around in our huge lounge area.  You know what?  For now on, a new rule.  Uh-oh.  When I see you in the morning and you see me and we see the rest of the gang.  No words.  No words.  We just sit around that office and just kind of nod at each other.  Because a lot of the stuff we say in the office is really funny, but then we have to reenact it. 
[01:06:00]  You've got to reenact it.  Well, okay.  And then you have to pretend.  I heard she's pregnant.  And then you have to pretend you haven't heard it yet.  And I have to do the same with you.  I go, really?  You went to Atlantic City, Anthony?  Even though I know all the details of your stupid trip.  Yes, Mr. Hughes.  I went to Atlantic City.  Went to Atlantic City.  We're good actors.  The listeners don't know that we're really good actors, actually.  Actual. 
[01:06:30]  How many stories have we told where I know every detail, but I have to sit there as the straight man and go, really?  Oh, I do the same thing.  I hope you'll say something.  And I'll ask a question knowing what the answer is.  Right.  You went to his house?  What's it like?  Well, I know.  I have a blueprint of it in front of me.  You're leading me on.  Oh, of course.  You're leading me down the road I need to be on.  You know what it is, though.  To get my cute little laughs in.  We understand.  But when I'm playing that part, I am the voice of the listener who wants to ask these questions, yet he is stuck on the outside of the radio. 
[01:07:00]  So we must ask those questions.  I love when we tell an old story.  Yeah.  And we make believe we're hearing it for the first time.  Oh, I know.  Dreamweaver.  Oh, and then, Opie, I grabbed the horse, and guess what?  The chick was fat.  Right.  Oh, no, really?  Good old rich in the tree for it.  Oh.  We go down that road where we tell our stock stories.  Yeah.  And I'll pretend I'm hearing it for the first time.  You're pretending to hear it for the first time.  Even though there's like ten versions of that same story already out there on the internet. 
[01:07:30]  One day I'll change it and just say I grabbed Richard by the hair and said, suck my cock, bitch.  Suck my cock.  Cop.  Jesus.  Forget it.  In a bit.  Suck my cock.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we put a siren on that car?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Oh, dear Lord.  I don't have a button.  I want one.  Poor Jimmy.  He just needs that one.  Where's my machine?  I love it.  Oh, good one, Jimmy. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  It was just me doing an impression.  Yeah.  So what was I getting at with that?  I have no idea.  Office stories.  Oh.  You were talking about the Cleveland Odeon, July 23rd.  And the fact that my second show is on sale now at Ticketmaster.  Oh.  I got it.  We bring her right back around.  Britney Spears and her boobs.  And her red titty.  Saw a picture yesterday.  She's very pregnant.  And her shirt was very see-through.  See everything.  And her tits are starting that descent.  Starting their final descent. 
[01:08:30]  And they were flattened out, like, from top to bottom.  Sort of flattening out, laying down on her pregnant belly.  And the nipples were pointing kind of to the sides and starting to become misshapen also.  They're not round anymore.  They're oval shaped.  And, you know, kind of remember what they looked like through her see-through clothing before she was pregnant.  They don't look like that no more. 
[01:09:00]  It's all baby food in there.  Two babies.  Friggin' Gerber food shoved in there now.  And it's just over.  The gravity pulling down on it.  Unbelievable.  Boy, Kevin really pumped a potent batch into her, didn't he?  He certainly did.  He didn't want just one check a month.  He wants two.  Give her a good helping.  Yeah, well, she's going to get that ripply, friggin' doily belly.  She's going to wear her little hip huggers. 
[01:09:30]  And her belly's going to be sticking out.  But it's going to be a little, you know, the stretched skin down there.  You know what, though?  The money she has, the workouts they do.  Like, a lot of those girls have a kid.  Skinny girls can.  Yeah, but the point I'm making.  With a little bit of meat to them, like she's always had.  The point I'm making is now we're hearing that it might be twins.  That's tough to come back from.  I don't think you ever come back from twins.  Twins.  Because that's double the baby in there, obviously.  Double the mass.  Two of them coming out of there.  That's right. 
[01:10:00]  Right when the first one stretches it out, the second one comes out there and just...  The second comes out nice, loosey-goosey.  Just slides right out.  Like a water slide.  Right.  Water park.  As soon as the vag closes, Tor Johnson comes barreling through, banging on the walls.  A baby of his size would have trouble eating your vagina.  That was very good.  All right.  Good luck to you.  We're going to change gears.  So hopefully Paul Field and his lovely wife there will have the Britney story.  They're up to 160 casualties now. 
[01:10:30]  Casualties?  Casualties and injury.  Yeah, that's injuries.  Doesn't mean deaths.  Okay.  See, there's a bunch of people getting nice Mylar blankets and white blankets now.  Showing them all.  This is nothing compared to the Blitz.  Look, see?  They're in little Mylar blankets.  What are those for?  I don't know.  They're like shock blankets or something.  What, do they just run a marathon?  Yeah.  They put it over you.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  What you got?  Clean movie clips. 
[01:11:00]  Ah.  We went down this road the other day and who took it upon themselves?  This guy Joe.  This guy Joe has been getting the original movie and the clean edit movie to compare what  they're doing with these films.  Yeah, we hate the fact that when they put a movie on regular television, they cut it up.  They take the language out.  Anytime they say the F word, they put in freaking or some other stupid word or the S word or  something like that.  And it's ridiculous.  We've seen the movie. 
[01:11:30]  We know what they're really saying.  What's the problem?  So we've got some examples here of the original part of the movie where they actually do use  the harsh language.  And then the TV edit, which is the ridiculous edit.  Yeah, we had fun with this last week, but now we've got some great examples.  Die Hard 2, Anthony.  Die Hard 2.  We all know and love that movie, right?  Of course we do.  I love the whole Die Hard series.  Well, here's some original dialogue.  Yeah, I'm there.  Victor, Victor, Victor.  Yeah, what's up?  Did you pack the Radio Max from the shoe with what you put them in your carry-on? 
[01:12:00]  Are you crazy?  I wouldn't let those assholes check them in.  I love you.  Give me one of the receivers.  Now, that seems pretty tame.  Assholes.  I wouldn't let one of those assholes check them in.  No, of course.  That seems like something you could allow on TV these days.  Asshole.  Even the cable channels that are...  There are channels that will allow that, right?  Of course.  They won't.  He's not saying, stick it up your asshole.  Right.  He's using it as, that guy's an asshole.  And that's the difference.  Right.  Anthony and I were very good with the FCC regulations. 
[01:12:30]  That's actually acceptable.  You can say asshole on regular radio.  But you'll probably get fined these days.  But you can't say, stick that banana up your asshole.  But you can say, that guy's an asshole.  That's right.  I bet you I know what they covered it up with.  All right, let's take a listen.  Yeah, anyone want to guess?  I'm going to guess Airhead.  Airhead?  Airhead.  Um, one of those...  I haven't heard it, so I don't know.  All right, wait.  Now I've got to listen to the original clip.  Let's hear the original again.  All right, Airhead's good, Jimmy. 
[01:13:00]  I'm going to say Antler.  I'm going to say...  Of course I'm not.  I'm going to say Aborigine.  I hate you because you just took my bit.  Why?  Because I was going to say Poopyhead.  That's even more ridiculous.  I like how you took it to the next level.  I've got to add Poopy to the list of ridiculous words. 
[01:13:30]  What are we up to so far?  Are we up to a list of ridiculous words?  Yeah, it just started the other day.  Poopy?  I didn't even know this was going on.  This is your list.  No one knew about this, but you...  I'm not writing a list.  A secret.  It's just a little list I keep.  Poopy, Heiney, and Crazy Radio Hose.  Yeah.  How do you spell Heiney?  Insane list maker.  How do you spell Heiney?  H-I-N-E-Y.  Of course.  N-E-Y.  Heiney.  And didn't we add the word...  I don't know.  There's an E in there somewhere.  H-I-N-E-Y.  H-I-E.  Didn't we add the word... 
[01:14:00]  I before E except after Heiney.  Didn't we add the word...  H-E-I?  What?  It's not H-E-I unless it's a German dumper.  No, it's...  Das Heiney.  Yes.  Heiney.  Didn't we add the word Sav to this list too?  Salve.  Salve.  Salve.  What's that L?  There's a very funny bit done by a guy named Frank Santorelli about words like that and  Sav is one of the words he uses.  Oh, really?  Salve.  He's Georgie on The Sopranos.  Okay. 
[01:14:30]  The guy who gets beat up every time?  Of course.  So, it's the list of funny words.  Mm-hmm.  Funny sounding words.  Do we add Sav to the list?  Salve.  No, that's just a weird one.  All right.  So far, it's Poopy and Heiney.  So, you didn't just...  You just started this list.  I wanted you to read off the list and you just started it.  I will read it off because, you know what?  You're like a crazy person.  When I hear a funny word, I'm not even going to acknowledge it.  I'm just going to write it on my list.  Jot it down.  And then one day, I'm going to have an actual bit to give to everybody.  You hear a funny word, just write it down. 
[01:15:00]  Jot it down.  All right.  Someone wants to guess...  That's the way you were talking, though.  You sound like Oscar Schindler.  All right.  I'm going to just jot this down.  Open it up.  You did one word on it.  I could have had more.  I just started the bit.  I could have had one more word.  One more word.  I just started the bit.  Give me time.  Poopy and Heiney so far.  That's great.  All right.  Sexy words.  Do we have to now play the original clip?  Because people have like 80-day and then short-term memory problems in the show.  I think they heard it.  I think they heard it.  All right.  Let's see what they replaced the asshole with. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, what's up?  Did you pack the radio mics from the show or did you put them in your carry-on?  Are you crazy?  I wouldn't let the...  Check them in.  I love it.  Oh, I should have thought animals.  That's easy.  It's a bad cut.  Oh, it's an awful cut.  Isn't that great?  Animals.  Just stop.  All right.  We got another example from Die Hard 2.  Here's the original dialogue.  Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.  What sets off the metal detectors first? 
[01:16:00]  The lead in your ass or the shit in your brain?  The lead in your ass or the shit in your brain?  The lead in your head or the stuff in your brain?  Do you remember this one?  No, not at all.  I'm just saying.  I don't know.  Hopefully it's dubbed in as anything but Bruce Willis.  He's great.  He's corny.  Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.  What sets off the metal detectors first?  The lead in your head or the junk in your brains? 
[01:16:30]  Look at how bad the voice is.  What was that?  The lead in your hat?  That was Pete Willis.  What was that?  The best part of this bit, when they replace it, it doesn't make sense.  Where's the lead in their hat?  The lead in your hat.  Or the what?  What was the other thing?  Or the stuff in your brain.  The stuff in your brain.  That was actually Bruce Hornsby.  Stunk.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Tom in New York.  Tom? 
[01:17:00]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Your funny word yesterday from your list you left out was lozenge.  Lozenge.  Oh, yeah.  Lozenge is a funny word.  Oh, lozenge.  That was your word yesterday.  That makes the list of my funny words.  Lozenge.  Lozenge.  You know, sir, you have some real lead in your hat.  Yeah.  Lozenge.  Yeah.  Stuff in your brains.  Yeah.  I'm punching out, guys.  See you?  That's more a nerdy word.  Like, do you have a lozenge?  That's so awful.  The guys get lead hats. 
[01:17:30]  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get lead hats.  We got a homework assignment for somebody.  Dan, go ahead.  Yeah, Darren in Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, Dan.  Go ahead.  Real quick.  I know you guys are playing a montage and everything, but probably the worst movie edit ever is Smokey and the Bandit when Jackie Gleason's cussing out his son.  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't even match up.  It's just horrible.  If somebody could put that together. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, someone has to do the Smokey and the Bandit edit.  That would be a really good one.  Big Kev had a little trivia to that also.  The voice that is taking place of, what's his name?  No, Jackie Gleason's voice is the fake Fred from the Flintstones.  Oh, no kidding.  Same guy.  Fake Fred.  Hey, Barney.  All right.  Awful.  Horrid.  That didn't even fit.  Didn't fit.  The voice was different.  I love these.  Well, we're going to do Smokey and the Bandit next. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, this will be an ongoing bit.  Do we have Smokey and the Bandit?  Not yet.  We got Die Hard 2.  Damn it.  I like that one.  Here's one more from Die Hard 2.  Before we move on to Dogma, which is a classic.  Dogma was a good one, too.  Yeah.  Die Hard 2.  Here's the original dialogue.  Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.  Ah, yes.  That is a famous line from the first one.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Why?  Do the movie.  It's fine.  It's an action movie.  They're fun to watch.  You don't have to put the yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, back in.  I bet I know what they covered up with.  Yeah.  Yippee-yahoo, motherfucker.  I didn't see that coming, Jimmy.  That's the beauty of your comedy.  Probably not even mother something, right?  I have no idea.  Let's just play it.  All right. 
[01:19:30]  Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon.  What voice was that?  Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon.  Yippee-ki-yay.  I am Bruce Willis.  That was awful.  Horrid.  Awful.  And some fat mom is sitting there with her son going, this is family entertainment.  Now we can watch it.  Family entertainment. 
[01:20:00]  Yuck.  Yuck.  All right.  We got some examples from Dogma.  Yuck.  Every time there's an edit, my face should just show up on their screen and go, ugh, with my fat neck.  Why is that frog ooking us, mommy?  I don't know.  All right, here's Dogma.  Some original dialogue.  Are you protesters?  You mean those dickheads with the signs and pictures of dead babies?  Shit, no.  Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.  Women's bodies are your own fucking business. 
[01:20:30]  But what are you doing hanging around?  Well, we're here to pick up chicks.  Excuse me?  We figure abortion clinics are a good place to meet loose women.  Why else would they be here in this lake to fuck?  Wow, now that's going to be tough to cover up for a tough one.  Let's get right into it because that was a lot of dialogue.  Wait a minute.  Are you protesters?  You mean those longheads with the signs and pictures of dead babies?  Hell no.  Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice.  A woman's body is your own freaking business.  But what are you doing hanging around? 
[01:21:00]  Well, we're here to pick up chicks.  Excuse me?  We figure abortion clinics are a good place to meet loose women.  Why else would they be here unless they're freaky?  Now, obviously, they did a second little reading with the same people.  It kind of works, though.  Well, it's because it's the same guy.  See, because nowadays, it's obvious that they redo some of these scenes knowing that eventually it's going to be on TV.  But in the old days, they had to get something to do that hopefully sounded like the original actor. 
[01:21:30]  And that's why those, I guess it's more fun to do with the older movies is what I'm getting at.  A little older, yeah.  If we're going to go down this road, you know?  Because that scene almost makes sense.  Yeah, it's ridiculous, but at least it's the same voice.  Let's try another one here.  Before they stoned my ass.  You were martyred?  Well, that's one way of putting it.  Another way is the set was bludgeoning the shit by big fucking rocks.  I mean, white folks...  White folks.  You were martyred?  Well, that's one way of putting it.  Another way is the set was bludgeoning the shit by big freaking rocks. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, white folks only want to hear the good things.  Life eternal, a place in God's heaven.  But as soon as you hear that you're getting this good stuff from a...  Stuff.  Stuff.  It wasn't that bad, though, again, because they used Chris Rock.  Yeah.  But you could tell he was uncomfortable saying freaking.  Like his brain stopped for a second.  And he had to think about it because he's used to saying fucking...  And the sound is different a little, you know?  They don't use the same air.  Yeah.  These aren't as bad.  We've got to get the old movies.  It's called...  What's it called?  Room something.  Room something.  Ambience. 
[01:22:30]  No, that's the word they use.  Sound or...  We're taking something.  Everyone on the set has to be quiet.  Oh, right, right.  Room tone.  Yeah, it might be room tone.  Room tone.  Yes, yes.  Apparently, I'm not a very good actor.  I don't know that.  Taking...  Go back to your paper at you, Mighty Duck fucks!  Snoogans.  Did you see that shit, man?  I know they were just kids where we kicked their fucking pubes asses.  Pubeless asses.  Freaks.  Go back to your paper rats, you Mighty Duck punks! 
[01:23:00]  Paper rats.  Snoogans.  Did you see that there, man?  I know they were just kids, but we kicked their pubis heads in.  Pubeless heads?  Pubis heads or something.  Pubis...  Wow.  Oh, brother.  You want one more?  It's not as good as the old movies.  No, it's not.  We'll do one more, though, here.  Not hard to believe.  Check this out.  When you were five, you let a kid from next door piss in your head. 
[01:23:30]  Ew, you did that shit?  You're nasty.  I know.  All right, that's the original?  There isn't much I don't know about you.  I find that hard to believe.  Check this out.  When you were five, you let a kid from next door spit in your head.  You're nasty.  Wow.  Spit.  All right.  You need the old ones.  The old ones are better because the voice changes.  Yeah.  It's just really awkward and dumb.  Got to get the Smokey and the Bandit one.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we want to thank Joe for sending that in.  He did a great job with that.  Wait for Joe. 
[01:24:00]  Obviously, that took a lot of time and effort, so thanks, Joe, for helping out the program  today.  Okay?  Okay.  As opposed to good...  Where were you at the kick-ass club?  I'm going to do some impersonations from now on.  I do good impersonations.  Sometimes you close your eyes, you think he was the real person.  And people know how a white girl could fall for me.  Is your buddy ready for the news?  Is it Nat King Cole over here?  Old Lego person here?  Yes.  Oh. 
[01:24:30]  What are they preparing?  Look, they're highlighting things.  Yes.  Husband and wife team.  Is he thirsty?  Is she a fucking limey, too, or what?  No, no, no.  Huh?  No?  She's American.  They were fighting already.  He asked, he's like, can I get some photos taken while I'm reading the news?  She goes, you are such a geek.  They were nice enough to invite you up here, and you're going to be doing that, and they  were already arguing.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Are they ready?  Yeah, they're ready when you are.  All right.  So we'll take a break, and we'll do the news.  I got a tinkle.  I don't know about you, but I got a tinkle.  Anybody else?  Hey, Fez.  I don't have to go, but I'll hold it for you. 
[01:25:00]  What's up with Ron and Fez?  Hey there, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  I don't know.  Frank.  Frank, you're on Ron and Fez.  Hi, Frank.  Hi, Frank.  Rumor has it.  Yeah, rumor has it.  Fez.  Rumor has it we're going to be expanding things on this channel in the near future.  But it's rumor and speculation.  Of course.  That's pretty definite.  Of course.  But it's, you know.  I love screwing with those message board people.  Oh, it starts whole things.  They're up to Ron and Fez 5 or 6 on the message board. 
[01:25:30]  Really?  Like for different topics.  They got a Ron and Fez 6, and it just fills up whenever we talk about it.  Oh, it was nice seeing Fez, by the way, at my DC show.  He came.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Hey!  Yes.  Yeah.  See, we do things differently on XM.  We actually get talented people that we're not scared of.  People that have done radio and proven themselves entertaining on the medium.  Not just, hey, that guy's got a name.  He's been in the news.  Let's hand him a few million and throw him on the air. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, exciting things right around the corner.  Some celebs, maybe?  For Channel 202.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's bad guy.  He's not true to himself.  He's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't drop it.  He's asshole.  Eric Dagle is this bisexual and competent radio guy, believe it or not. 
[01:26:30]  I don't like love that he's down.  He's not really that smart.  He's here, I can go fuck himself.  So be it.  Dread no more.  To take two pieces, to prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again with the words that you will evermore.  All right. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  All right.  We're getting ready for Paul Field and his wife rearranging the studio.  Who is Paul Field again, Jimmy?  I can't hear my stupid headphones.  What happened? 
[01:27:30]  Well, you've got to plug it in there, Jimmy.  There you go.  Oh, there you go.  I'm a little closer to Ant right now.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  All my CDs and stuff that I sell on my website is shipped by Paul, who was a fan.  He used to work for a company, a VCR company, contacting me.  He used to smash JVC.  And when we were off the air, and I said I wanted to do some CDs or something, he offered  to help me sell them.  And I pay him, and he sells on my site, and he does a good job. 
[01:28:00]  He also runs wowfans.com?  Yes.  Or .org or . . . something.  C-U-E.  They're good, though.  And he laughs a lot at his own awkward moments, which I love.  He's just a classic.  Really?  The guy's just a fucking classic.  Yeah, he can't hear us right now.  No, he can't.  We're going to make him try to say a lot of words with TH and . . .  You'll hear this on the replay.  That's right, stupid.  You don't say your THs properly.  You say Fs.  That's right.  He will listen to this. 
[01:28:30]  Absolutely.  The old days, we got away with murder, man.  We would just abuse people, and then . . .  Ah, we did that show, and it's just gone.  Out there in the heavens somewhere, unless we're taping it on a cassette.  Man, now I hear from people.  I didn't know you said all that shit about me before I came into the studio.  Now I'm going to get a bunch of empty CD things shipped out.  People complaining.  You fucking thief, Norton.  Getting sued.  All right, let's get him in here.  Get him in here, Hawk.  Quickly open that door.  Paul Field and his wife with the news.  You thief.  I hear Dee Dee's in town, by the way, speaking of the news. 
[01:29:00]  What is she doing?  She's doing here in New York.  I think she might stop by either today or tomorrow.  Is she busy?  We haven't talked to Dee Dee in over a month.  That's not good.  She gives us good radio.  Hi, Paul.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  What are you doing?  Mrs. Paul.  Hey, how are you?  Just call me Denise.  Denise.  Denise.  And Paul.  What's going on?  Hi.  Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  How'd you guys meet again?  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  As soon as we walk in the room, we're set up. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, right?  Well, back before the internet, which I know Anthony will know about as a university guy,  we met on the old local bulletin boards.  Actually, I was in England and she was in America.  And we met on the Chat Chalet BBS in Rochelle Park, New Jersey.  The old bulletin board.  Yes.  The hell's up?  2,400 BBS.  What?  2,400?  Yeah.  Wow.  International.  I was like...  It's like a chat line where a bunch of people just go and talk.  It's like 300. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  It was the worst modem ever.  I was losing...  I was playing trivia contests online.  And I couldn't even get text to transmit quickly enough.  It was awful.  I was a geek.  I had a computer way back when before modems were really fast.  Is that what you had to see prompt on?  Yeah, it used to, you know, when you're loading from your cassette loader, C-load.  Because programs came on regular cassette tapes like that you would put in a cassette player. 
[01:30:30]  It would take forever to load.  Yeah.  How old are you?  I'm 34.  How old?  Just turned, 34.  Wow.  Last week.  You seem too young to be on...  What?  Ask her how old she is, because that's the twist.  How old are you?  I'm 10 years older.  I'm 43.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're doing something right.  You seemed like a good idea at the time.  You know what I'm saying?  You're like the older one.  When did you hook up? 
[01:31:00]  How long ago was it?  11 years.  11 years ago?  Yeah, he was 22.  When I was 22 and she was 30, I'm like, yeah, that's cool.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You were 22 and...  So I was just 32.  I was 32, yeah.  And I was married at the time, too.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow, really?  Yeah, yeah.  One of those, you know, little internet romances going on.  Wow, the husband must have been happy.  And so you're how old?  34.  And you're 44.  Or to be the chef.  Yeah, I'll be 44.  Wow, look at that.  And what happened? 
[01:31:30]  You're on the internet for whatever it was back then.  We started talking.  And he was calling me on the phone.  And I guess we got into some pretty heavy phone sex.  Why was he calling on the phone?  I was in England still.  Yeah, he was in England.  It went from internet to talking on the phone.  And your husband had no clue about this?  Yeah, no, he did.  He did?  Yeah, he knew.  He knew.  We were...  He said, I'm moving out.  See ya.  No, no, he didn't say...  Actually, that's what I told him.  He was oblivious. 
[01:32:00]  He didn't care.  He didn't care.  He didn't care.  I mean, that's why I was on the internet searching for someone.  He was fine.  As long as the Mets are winning.  That's what he cared about.  Yeah, right?  The Mets are winning.  Why are you naked with the other guy in the other room?  Really?  Oh, believe me.  And that's...  Well, that's gone on.  Wait, you were in the same house?  Actually, for a while, yeah.  We had gotten back together, my husband and I, for a while.  And Paul came over to America.  And he needed a place to stay.  And he stayed with us.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So he's at work and I'm taking care of business. 
[01:32:30]  What was the excuse you gave him?  Yeah.  What did you tell the husband?  There's a lot going on.  I know.  I'm not getting as many details as I need.  We're not just throwing the news folder in the garbage.  We want to be here today.  Believe me, we have a story all of our own.  All right, hold on.  Let's back up a little bit here.  All right.  Let's get this.  I want all the info.  Message boards.  Oh, my God.  Because you were looking for something else because you were miserable in your marriage.  He's in London across the...  Well, I was bored, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Across the pond.  You're bored.  But now, did you tell your husband, hey, I'm talking to this guy in England?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he knew.  And he knew.  And everything was fine.  He didn't care.  In fact, a lot of times when he was over, I mean, he would help me and the kids and  he'd walk us out the door.  He didn't care.  So, I'm like, fine.  Well, that's the way you want to be.  It kind of didn't start off, you know, as a romance.  It was a lot like a friendship.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, officially.  Oh, come on.  We can talk about it now, can't we? 
[01:33:30]  Wait, and then you started having phone sex.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  So, you have the phone sex.  I'm officially quitting my job now and not going back there again.  Everyone's sitting there listening to me.  What kind of phone sex?  Hot.  From England?  Hot.  Oh, yeah.  Well, hello.  Would you love the phone on your twat?  No, no, no.  That must have been expensive.  No, no.  No.  A lot of heavy breathing.  Heavy breathing going on.  It was hot.  All right.  Hot phone sex.  Nice.  And now, you're coming to America.  Yeah.  What was the excuse? 
[01:34:00]  Like, all of a sudden, you just came to America.  Me?  Well, I came.  I'd been to America a couple of times before, but all of the women I, like, talked to, you  know, that I'd been interested in, turned out to be fucking blimps.  Oh, my God.  So, you know, you know how it works.  Jimmy's on AOL.  Well, he knows.  He's had a few knock on his door and say hi.  He knew some of the ones that he hung out with.  All right, wait a minute.  Some of them would have had to have been cut out of the house.  You know what I'm saying?  You were coming to America just to meet some of the women you were talking to online?  Not just that.  I've always wanted to come to the States because I'm not really big on the foreign languages,  so I really wanted to come from England to somewhere and spoke my language. 
[01:34:30]  And I'd really been interested in America, and I came over here.  So now how did...  No, no, no, no.  American women were easier.  That's what it is.  Yeah, well, you know, the British accent seems to work pretty well.  Where were you going to stay?  Well, I was actually staying at a friend's house for a while.  And, you know, and then just moved around a bit.  But how did now you go to...  You have to go to your husband and say, hey...  Well, they were separated when I first talked to them.  They were actually separated.  You left your husband.  Yeah, I left.  No, when we first started talking, I was there, but I was looking. 
[01:35:00]  And then when we decided that we were going to hook up, you know, I moved out.  Got my own place.  Got your own place.  Yeah, and that's when he...  You two hook up.  It's no more phone sex.  It's real sex.  Yeah.  And then you get back with your husband?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Good question.  Because the rent was due.  No.  I could never work for it then.  I couldn't provide...  A little cash, right?  Yeah, that's right.  You forgot the photo story when I sent the photo because we didn't... 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my God.  We didn't know what each other looked like when we first started talking.  And then I believe I sent my picture first.  Yeah, you did.  And then she changed the phone number.  I mean...  But her picture was hot, you know.  I'm like, wow.  I'm looking on the back thinking, you know, this is going to be a cutout of a magazine I'm getting here, you know.  You know, that was the 2400 BPS, 150K download of a GIF file.  You know what I'm talking about?  So it was taking forever.  That was the longest hour and a half of my life.  Okay, I can see the top of her head now.  Is it going to suddenly get wider? 
[01:36:00]  You're worried about what the bottom of the picture is going to look like.  I'm like, it's okay to the shoulders.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I was a lot skinnier then.  Crossing my fingers, please.  All these days alone in my room and British women are just fucking hideous or just stuck-up cunts.  So you Americans go over there and you think they're cool, but us British guys, there's only two kinds of English women. 
[01:36:30]  There's the good-looking ones and the fat bitches that think they're good-looking.  And that's really it.  There really is nothing else.  Really?  The men aren't too much to speak for either.  And I brushed my teeth, just to clear that one up for you.  Right.  I mean, I brushed my teeth.  I want to understand now, you got back with your husband.  Okay, yeah.  For whatever reason.  Yeah, why did you go back?  Well, he moved in the way you moved in.  I think actually, no, no, no.  To tell you the truth, I think it actually was because he had nowhere to go. 
[01:37:00]  He had nowhere to go.  Yeah, we had given up the place where, you know, we were together.  And he found himself, I guess, kind of out on the streets.  And of course, it was me.  I mean, you know, I'm a sucker.  I took him back in.  So now, when you took him back in, it was more like a roommate than it was a husband and wife.  Yeah, you know, it was.  And it was like that for a long time.  So that's why you were able to bring...  You were sleeping in the same bed?  I was on the couch.  Yeah, well, like I said, you know, we had two kids. 
[01:37:30]  Wait, were you as husband and wife back together?  Were you still having sex, sleeping in the same bed?  Yeah.  Whore.  Fuck off.  Listen, here's a funny one.  There's nothing funnier than when I was there, and me and her would be on the computer on  the chat room at night, and whatever days he's trying to get laid, he'd stay up until  about mid, and I'd just sit there looking interested, waiting for her to get up.  Waiting for her to come to bed so he can have some sex.  Yeah, every other night he'd be in bed sleeping at 10 o'clock.  Oh, man.  He's like, wow, what does she call on slash greater than sign mean? 
[01:38:00]  Oh, brother.  So you're still having sex with him as your now, whatever he would be, boyfriend or whatever,  is sleeping on the couch.  Well, actually, you were out and about your own time, you know?  So you were going out.  Yeah, he was going out.  He wasn't always there.  We're back together.  You can sleep on the couch as a friend.  Right.  Did the husband know that you guys were involved or no?  I don't think he really realized that we did it.  I don't think he really realized that we actually were together, we'd ever been together. 
[01:38:30]  What's that?  I don't think he ever knew that we'd really been together, even though now we will probably  deny it.  But, I mean, I remember before he came back in, hiding in the shower while he came over  to pick up the kids.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we were pretty bad.  He comes over to pick up the kids.  You guys are, I guess, involved.  I'm like, please don't let him need to go to the bathroom.  Go what?  I'm standing in the bathroom.  You know, I'm standing in the bathtub and he's like, you know, there's nobody here.  You know, just take the kids.  See ya. 
[01:39:00]  Thanks for stopping by.  Shit, if he needs to take a piss, I'm fucked, you know?  Or it dumps even worse.  You've got to just sit there and resign the shower.  Oh, listen to him and go, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, yeah.  The funniest twist of it all is he's the world's biggest Howard Stern fan, so this is a big  stab in the balls for him.  He's getting fucked over on the OPN Andy show.  Ooh.  Are you still in contact with him?  Yeah, you know, actually we are friends.  Yeah, we have two beautiful daughters together.  I'm, you know, we're friends. 
[01:39:30]  Still friends.  He's got his thing, I got mine.  You know, it just didn't work out.  He's banging some girl called Denise.  He doesn't want to change the stationery.  That's true.  And I'm not joking.  That is true.  Who's married and what's her address?  I don't know.  She's married and has two kids.  All right, so are you guys married now?  Yeah, yeah, we've been married.  It'll be eight years.  And you have a kid together?  Yeah.  A little girl.  Yep.  Wow.  That is such a story.  Actually, uh, our eight-year-old was a bridesmaid at our wedding.  And there's a twist because the divorce didn't come through until after she popped. 
[01:40:00]  It's ironic.  He wouldn't file or pay for the divorce.  But getting pregnant and getting a, you know, a $10,000 medical bill pretty much kicks  the divorce into going, you know?  Ah, yeah, he didn't want to have to pay for that.  He had to pay for it, though, because of these...  I was still under his insurance, though.  Wait, wow, you're under his insurance having a kid with...  Oh, my God.  But the divorce was followed rather quickly when I had a cup.  I would strangle someone.  Oh, someone's got to be choked.  Someone has to be dead.  Someone just had to be choked.  So you're banging your husband. 
[01:40:30]  He's on the couch.  Were you banging both at the same time?  I'm not going to say.  Not in the same fucking bed.  I'm feeling to incriminate myself.  The divorce is over, though.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Once the divorce is through, we've moved on.  I was banging them every chance I got.  I hope you mean me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Jimmy is totally quiet, just staring at you.  Well, I've told Jimmy many of my little...  Yeah, I know a lot of it.  I don't know all the different details.  I don't think she didn't know about this.  No, she's told me.  Okay, so anyway, on with the news. 
[01:41:00]  This is great.  You're a class act.  Yeah.  That is something.  All right.  I think we've just scratched the surface of these two.  Yes, we definitely have.  I'm sure this thing is going on.  I mean, I can tell you stories about him, that would.  All right, give us one.  Yeah, please.  Well, talking about his desperate days of getting laid.  What?  You know, I mean, he used to be on these phone chat lines.  Oh, my God.  And he met this one girl from Oregon named Diana.  Okay?  I mean, nice girl, whatever, but she was paralyzed from waist down. 
[01:41:30]  Lawsuit.  There you go.  Lawsuit coming.  Can I get a waiver on this one?  She may have XM.  I don't know.  Well, put it this way.  I mean, you know.  I thought you were talking about a different one.  It does lose the heart.  I didn't think you meant that one.  Christ.  He had a little romantic escapade with her.  This is when you guys were hanging?  Yeah, this was when we were hanging.  In fact, one time she thought she was even pregnant.  This was actually while this was going on.  Oh, brother.  She got back with her husband at the time I was off having a bit of fun with that. 
[01:42:00]  With the old paralyzed dog.  With the old paralyzed dog.  You were in a chat.  I would have said to him, I mean, what's it like, you know?  Did you feel anything?  There were some chat phone systems back in the day.  So you would hang out in those?  I didn't think anyone hung out in those.  This is way back when.  This is like 93.  99, what was it, 976?  These were 515-something.  So you would just call into this number, these party lines, and just hang out there?  It was just for a bit of fun.  Yeah, I'd go into all these separate little rooms they had.  I met a few people and, you know.  And you met this girl? 
[01:42:30]  You pretty much figured out why they were on chat lines when you met them.  I just want to get right to the point.  So you banged a girl that was paralyzed?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, the funny thing is, you should tell her it was when they were in the motel one time,  right?  I mean, hotel, whatever.  What hotel was this?  Oh, okay.  This is a story you told me.  Motel?  I'm not that cheap.  I don't know.  Hotel, motel, wherever.  You flew out to Oregon?  No.  Yeah?  No, no, no.  I didn't fly.  I took the two-and-a-half-day fucking Amtrak.  That was exciting.  You took a train for two-and-a-half days?  I was fucking broke. 
[01:43:00]  I was broke.  My parents are still paying that visa bill now.  This guy came out totally broke.  And you know, Amtrak, those assholes, they make seats that don't recline enough for you  to sleep.  I'm sure you do.  You guys are obviously in first class, you fucks, in your beds.  You're still not getting at the good point.  No, I'm skipping over it rather quickly.  Yeah, skipping over it.  Yeah.  Just to rub it in, we don't have to bang chicks that are in wheelchairs either, Paul.  A wheelchair.  Although we would.  Although we would, just.  So she's in a wheelchair. 
[01:43:30]  Just to have the story.  Yeah, they're in a hotel.  Did you, wait, wait, did you know she was in a wheelchair when you're talking to her on  the phone?  Not at first, but she told me.  She told you when?  Before I went out there.  Oh, before you went out there.  Yeah, it wasn't like, oh, by the way, I'll be at the one at the station in the fucking  electric wheelchair.  I'm like, oh, sorry, that train's been canceled for the next six months.  Bye.  So now you knew she's in the wheelchair.  So now what did you think?  Did you think, oh boy, I'm not going to get laid or it's going to be weird?  I thought my chances were higher.  Yeah.  It wasn't an electric one. 
[01:44:00]  So she can't get away from you.  Right.  So you get there, you meet up with her.  How long?  Was she hot?  Besides the fact that she was in a wheelchair?  Can I plead the fifth because my wife's next to me?  Oh, she was hot.  Oh, was she hot?  She was better than expected.  Well, as I said, most of the chat room girls were like, you know, 9,000 pounds.  Yeah.  She was hairy.  Anything under 200 was fine.  She was hairy.  How the fuck do you know?  Did you eat a box?  I saw pictures.  Did you eat a box?  How do you know she's hairy?  Oh, God. 
[01:44:30]  No, I would prefer unshavened ones.  Thank you.  I mean, shaved ones.  Shavened.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jimmy, you prefer the shaved ones or the ones that haven't grown hair yet?  So you do the girl thing?  That time?  Well, I'm not saying that I do.  I mean, I've had a little experience.  She once in a while drops hints.  And if you're a lesbian for a day plan, it's still going.  All right.  So let's get back to the story.  Anthony went down a nice road here.  So you show up and she wasn't that bad and she was in a wheelchair.  Completely paralyzed from the waist down? 
[01:45:00]  She in a car accident.  That's what it was, yeah.  Yeah, so.  That's terrific.  Where are we going here, by the way?  How long did it take from the time you meet her at the train station?  Did you meet her at the train station?  Yeah.  All right.  To the time where you're actually having sex with her?  It was a couple of days.  It was a couple of days.  Yeah, it didn't start off that I was going to get any.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was on the couch again there.  On the couch.  That doesn't seem to work too long.  Usually he goes for the first night.  Now, she lived alone, I guess?  She had a roommate, but he was cool. 
[01:45:30]  You know, he was just a roommate.  A guy roommate.  Yeah, I think he was queer.  A little queer guy roommate.  All right.  So you hook up.  And now how do you make the move on a paralyzed girl like that?  You put your hand on her leg because she doesn't notice?  Slowly move up?  I'm like, she wakes up, her legs are in the air, she's getting banged.  What's going on?  Can I kiss you?  And she says no.  And I'm like, you know, when I pull my hand out of her twat.  And is it rape if you can't feel it?  That's right.  There you go. 
[01:46:00]  Now I got a signed waiver on that one.  So you're just hanging out with her, I guess.  What are you doing?  A little activities?  Yeah, actually, we just did the tour of Portland, Oregon.  It's a pretty nice city, actually.  A little tour of Portland, all right.  So what did you see in Portland besides every place without steps?  A bunch of ranch houses?  Everywhere you could see from a car at 35 miles per hour.  At what?  Everywhere you could see.  Don't fucking car crash me. 
[01:46:30]  No, I didn't hear what you said.  No, I was saying everywhere you could see from a car at 35.  Oh.  See, it wasn't funny the first time.  It was a good one.  Oh, it was good.  It was just, yeah.  Anyway, go ahead.  Hey, can I change the subject now?  No, no.  So you get to know each other.  You get to know each other a little more, just hanging out.  Now, how is the move made from a friend dropping by sleeping on the couch to romance?  Well, my wife hasn't heard these stories.  Can she remember the roof of the room at this point in history?  My 8-year-old said a home guy, look, daddy's on the radio. 
[01:47:00]  What, he fucked a cripple?  It's a lot.  Daddy, you fuck cripple?  It's a long time ago.  Yeah.  Her legs are fine now.  I don't care.  She's gone.  I'm here.  We were up in the overlook of the city, and it was sunset and bullshit.  All right, a little romantic.  It wasn't planned.  Did you have a few drinks or something?  No, because we were driving.  She wouldn't need it.  She didn't feel anything anyway. 
[01:47:30]  Right?  She was feeling no pain.  Yeah, she was feeling no pain.  You guys did it in the car?  No, no.  We just made out.  We did it in the house.  All right, and then you make out a little during that romantic little sightseeing there,  and then you go back to her place, and it gets a little more involved.  All of a sudden, now, I'm not sleeping on the couch anymore.  Right.  Now you're in her bed.  Yeah.  I know exactly where this is going.  You go to the bed.  No, no.  Dude, none of us have experience with banging a chick that's powered.  Did you have to help her from the wheelchair into the bed? 
[01:48:00]  When you were on radio in Buffalo, that's 40 all you could get, though, wasn't it?  Did you have to help her into the bed, or did she have that down?  Uh, it was like, let me get myself ready, and you hear, you know, things folding up, and  springs, and fucking winches, and bullshit.  Oh, my God, you're more pathetic than I thought you were.  A winch, and springs clicking, and snapping.  Holy shit.  You see the floor come up to the level of the bed, and she flops in. 
[01:48:30]  So, Jimmy, how does this compare with the rib-willed hookers you get?  I've never had a cripple in my life.  Is that going to be the next thing?  Dude, you're not done.  You've got to watch out.  I've got to know.  Now, you ought to be thinking.  Now, obviously, you were experienced pleasing a woman.  You had been, uh...  Oh, yeah, a real experience.  You would have had some women before that.  Was that your second one, ever?  Was it?  Actually, no, no.  Was she the third?  You were the second. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, I was the second?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  So, I had a few lessons, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, okay.  Well, anyway, you kind of knew what a girl needed.  Yeah, a cock.  Right, there you go.  I didn't have money, but I had a cock, and pretty much I covered it.  So, how did you...  Did you kind of think, like, hmm, this is perplexing, because if she's numb down there,  what the hell am I supposed to do?  If she says that's a huge fucking dick, when it's in there, I'll be like, hmm, I wonder  if she's lying, you know?  Wow. 
[01:49:30]  So...  She'd definitely be lying.  Why are you laughing and car crashing me?  That's not fair.  You laughed.  I was laughing.  You're right.  It's like that car crash.  So, now, having sex with a crippled girl.  What is that like?  Does she...  It's like a sack of potatoes, but with the top half's talking back to you, and the bottom  half's not arguing.  So, yeah?  Did she enjoy it?  Like...  I don't know.  I wish I tried anal thinking about it, because she never would have known. 
[01:50:00]  Did you grab her ass?  Why bother?  Because you're doing it?  No, but I heard you had to lift her legs up for her.  What?  You did?  Did you have to lift her legs up?  Well, geez.  Yeah, it was pretty mechanical, you know what I'm saying?  Hold on, let me push a button.  Okay, legs are up in here.  Were they atrophied at all?  Okay.  Like, you know, kind of...  I did high school, but I can't remember what atrophied was.  It's like she's holding those two awful turnip roots.  Yeah, like skinny toothpick legs, because they haven't been used.  Or do they feel different than a person that... 
[01:50:30]  Thank you.  Did they feel different when you flopped them up?  Did they feel different?  No, they just felt like there was nothing moving them around.  Like dead weight?  Yeah.  Was it like holding arms, those thin, muscler-less calves?  Two white shoes on?  Fucking nurse shoes?  Useless shoes.  Never...  The soles never get dirty?  Pristine sneakers.  Still have that, like, news sticker on the bottom?  It's because you're clean. 
[01:51:00]  Because imagine that scene from I'm Gonna Get You Suckerware to go put some legs up on the nightstand.  But they were real.  Fuck.  You didn't know.  Ovie just fucked me up.  I do a good job.  Yeah, I know.  That's the problem.  All right, so...  Wow.  What happened what?  I'm done.  No, no, no.  That happened in the hotel.  I just gotta ask you again.  I mean, did she enjoy it?  Was there any signs that she was enjoying this process? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, she...  You're just slamming her and she can't feel a thing?  She said she could feel something down there, but I don't know if that was just a...  Yeah.  She just wanted to be held and she was just happy you were there.  Right.  It must be nice not to have a metal holding you up.  So what happened to this broad?  That was one and done?  Or did she do anything to you, extracurricular?  Any, you know, below?  No, really?  Shut up.  You'd think she would be really good at blowjobs.  I know.  I was just thinking that.  I don't remember.  Like, you know how people...  I guess she wasn't that good at it.  They lose their legs and they build up their upper body strength. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  And they got, like, big arms.  You would think if she loses the sensation down there and the vag, you know, you work that  mouth to do everything you possibly can.  It'd be like getting blown by Lieutenant Dan.  Three or four tries at Doggy Star, but as the fucking pedos get falling off the bed and  shit, you know?  Fucking hang her up on the balcony and go get a ladder.  Someone's calling you the British boss.  Did you go down on her?  No.  I've only had two car crashes and I've been here 20 minutes, so fuck off. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Did you go down on her at all?  Yeah, did you?  Why bother?  Why bother?  Why bother?  I could be licking her fucking knee.  Oh, it feels so good, you lying cunt.  Licking her knee.  Jesus.  Her hairy knee.  So that was...  You can press C word a lot a couple of times right before we come in here.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we know the English love that word anyway.  So, uh...  I saw many of them in the country a lot.  So you got a story...  You got something on her?  Some dirt?  Oh, yeah.  Now she's fucked because she told me not to tell you this.  What?  But, uh...  Yeah, well, this might get you some phone calls or maybe just nothing, but... 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I can give some techniques.  I'm...  How old were you?  17?  She's lying.  When she was 15, her mother taught her how to give blowjobs on a banana.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm pissed off she doesn't have any strawberries because maybe she tickled my ball bag a little.  I said...  I wrote that three days ago.  I'm like, please let me use that.  But, uh...  But, uh...  Yeah.  Maybe you can find out if other people had their moms show them how to do stuff.  Your mother took a banana and showed you how to give head.  Well, actually, she gave... 
[01:53:30]  No, actually, she drew a picture first of a penis.  Yeah.  And she explained what each part was.  And she told me, you know, she told me how a guy liked to be held.  Did she draw a peeler or did she draw a, uh...  No, she drew a one with a nice heart, you know, head.  All right.  You know, nice helmet.  All right.  And she did, you know, she did.  She drew the diagram and she said, okay, you know, uh, this is how, you know, you give  a guy a blowjob and she was telling me, like, you know, you first take your tongue and you 
[01:54:00]  lick all the way from the bottom all the way to the top, you know, kind of like swirl  your tongue all around the, you know, the head, you know, and then, of course, with your  hand, you make a, you know, nice motion up and down, you know, tickle is...  You're really embarrassing me.  Did she tell you like this or did she explain it like a human?  Let me go get your father and we'll practice.  No, my mom was really cool about sex. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, I used to have...  Did she actually do it to the banana?  Well, she said, you know, you know, the banana came in...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  She, so she has a banana in her hand.  Did she give you one and you just did what she did?  Is that what was happening?  No, no, no.  The banana came into part when she started talking to me about guys who were uncircumcised.  Yeah.  Okay, and that how you have to peel down...  Peel it like a banana?  Well, yeah, you got to peel it down, you know, you got to remove it down to, you know, expose 
[01:55:00]  them, you know what I mean, bring it out.  Then she got out a bigger black banana.  Well, let me tell you something, you know what, you might laugh.  This is what, if you want some money, this is what you'll have to fucking suck.  Bring mommy some shopping money.  It's the worst.  Move on to eggplants.  Wrap your mouth around this.  In more ways than one.  I don't care, mom might have taught me, but you know what, I've never had a complaint yet. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  You had to give a couple of refunds, though.  I must say, a guy will rarely complain that a blowjob is going poorly.  Rarely.  What about the wood chipper?  Well, the wood chipper, yeah, teeth, that's rough.  You don't even deal with that, though.  But you'll deal with it, because, yeah, you don't want to go away angry.  She doesn't know anybody, they're just coming in.  Right.  Probably the braces, anyway.  These two are a class act, I got to tell you.  You two are something, man.  That's very positive, is it? 
[01:56:00]  Nah, that's a good one.  I hope so.  I got to like it in a good way.  Believe me, complete opposite.  Really?  You guys will move to the studio so we can't find you again.  You were a geeky guy, though.  You were like computer geek.  I was?  I mean, let me tell you, the first time I saw him, when he stepped off the plane, I said  to myself, what the hell am I doing?  Yeah.  Why?  Because, I mean, picture this guy.  I had the glasses, the whole drill.  Okay, greasy, black hair, you know, parted to the side.  Rectangle glasses, okay?  Short sleeve shirts with the pocket, the button gown, you know, like, those, like, pocket protectors. 
[01:56:30]  Pocket protectors?  I don't know about a fucking pocket protector.  Yeah, you did.  What the fuck?  You were a class act.  I got off the plane, I said, MILF, that was the end of me.  MILF?  Yeah, that's right.  I wasn't lying.  I mean, he was.  Took me two hours.  And he had this nervous laugh all the time.  Two hours.  And that includes check-in and driving to the house.  It took me two hours from the plane to her vagina.  Yes.  Two hours from touchdown on the runway and we had to taxi for 20 minutes. 
[01:57:00]  He had a lot of practice on the phone, okay?  It wasn't like I just banged him the first day I met him.  You know, I mean, he had to warm my engine up.  Oh, that's hysterical.  She's like, wow, that doesn't taste like a banana.  Or eggplants.  No, and we still don't.  First day.  You're right off the plane within two hours, you're inside.  Yeah, the plane landed at, like, 9.50 and 11 o'clock.  I was right in the happy highway.  Wow, you checked into a hotel and that was it. 
[01:57:30]  No, no, no, I had my own place.  Oh, your own place, close to the airport.  No, no, no.  No, it was pretty close.  It was like driving distance.  Wow, that is something.  Thanks.  Well, we just like, I like this whole, everyone's relationship's a little different.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's nice.  I like women.  Jimmy likes anything.  I like girls.  Hey, I like Jimmy.  All right, well, the phones have exploded, obviously.  Of course, I come here, so you guys can fuck me up.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass. 
[01:58:00]  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if her mother told her to just suck the head.  Don't put the whole thing in your mouth.  Well, we've got to get, hold on, I'm sorry.  Eric, Eric, you've got to find some kind of, should we find, we've got to find some good  headphones for these guys.  They're broken right now.  What?  Yeah, get the good headphones.  Any headphones.  Actually, the phone calls, they have to be on.  Yeah, why don't they have headphones?  No, because the ones were broken before, that was my thing, because they weren't, they weren't.  Because you guys were expecting tons of car crashes, and you didn't want us to hear.  Yeah, that must have been it.  Her mother, we live, actually, her mother lived in Munaki, and her name was Pat as well, 
[01:58:30]  but we're funny.  I'm not bloated.  You just had to be there.  So now we have to stall until these guys get headphones.  I mean, my mom, like I said, my mom was so cool.  I mean, I'd have a boyfriend over in my room, and she'd knock on my door, and she'd be like,  do you need a towel?  I mean, you know, she knew I was having sex in the room.  She didn't care.  What time is the bus taking the Negro back to Newark?  I told you.  I've been controlling myself, because none of us sexual escapades involve minorities at this point. 
[01:59:00]  At this point, do they?  I'll never tell.  I said mine.  Let me clear that one up.  Yours.  You've banged the black guys?  Well, put it this way.  I had one do me.  What?  That I banged.  What?  The guy's moving, and you're just laying there saying...  No, no.  Did he attack you?  No, he...  I can't even hear myself with that. 
[01:59:30]  He cornered me.  He cornered you?  He cornered me, yeah, in a restaurant.  In a restaurant?  Yeah.  A black guy?  Yeah, a famous one, too.  A famous black guy.  Not from this country.  He cornered you in a restaurant.  Pele?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  He was an English soap star.  This one was Pele Black.  I thought he was like...  An English soap star.  English soap star, yeah.  We were doing...  We were doing, um...  Jesus.  Like a fan club.  A fan club meeting.  Yeah, she was the prize, obviously.  Yeah, we were... 
[02:00:00]  And the guy came over from England, you know, to meet everybody at this fan club meeting.  He said, hi, I'm famous Negro.  Suck this.  We all had a bit of drinks.  Yeah.  I went up to the bathroom.  And I'm in the fucking place with my kids sitting there going, well, she's in the...  I'm just going to take a piss, okay?  Oh, wow.  Why is that Negro escorting you to the women's room?  The next thing I know, he had me bang up against the wall.  Yeah.  In the ladies room?  You know, drag me into a bathroom stall.  Yeah.  And...  Happened. 
[02:00:30]  And had sex with you.  Yeah.  Wait, and this was after you guys were together?  Yeah.  After you had a kid together?  Yeah.  Wow.  How long ago?  Oh, this was before we got married, though, right?  Yeah.  You're fucking better, Ben.  I'll kill you at 12.  Wow.  Now, let's not go there, okay?  Let's not go there.  You go to a place where you end up having sex with a black guy in the bathroom.  Oh, no.  I didn't have sex with them.  I blew them.  Hang on a minute.  You blew them?  I blew them.  You had some niggas cock in your mouth.  You better have been to the fucking dentist. 
[02:01:00]  What the fuck?  Hey, I had a few drinks with me.  That's not all you had in yours, is it?  That's a little chocolate milk.  In a big, black, meaty spear.  Holy shit.  We've got to give these two their own show on this channel.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  What's up with the Negroes at 11 p.m.?  Wow.  Hey, let me tell you something.  That was the first time that I ever saw a black cock, and it was big. 
[02:01:30]  I mean.  It was big?  Yeah, it was big.  Thank you.  So you, did he pull it out first, or did you, like, he had you pinned, did you slowly?  No, he pulled it out, and he, like, shoved it in front of me, like, shoved it at my mouth,  you know?  Yeah.  I mean, what am I supposed to do?  I was, like, scared.  I was in a situation where.  Say, hello, I'm white.  No cash is transacted.  I'm locked in a bathroom stall, okay?  I see no way out.  Well, your boyfriend is downstairs with your kid, right?  Yeah, I didn't know about the story. 
[02:02:00]  And I'm sitting, and I'm thinking, like, all right, what do I do?  Do I just, like, blow this guy a little bit, and let him get off, and just, like, he'll  leave me alone?  That isn't a little bit.  That wouldn't be a little bit.  Once the guy comes, that's blowing complete.  You know, then I can go back to, like, normal life, you know?  Were you turned on doing it?  Watch it there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Blowing a little bit stops when the mace gets sprayed in his face.  I have had many situations like this happen to me.  This wasn't just the first time this happened to me.  No, not black niggers, or whatever. 
[02:02:30]  I don't use that word.  What's a black nigger?  Whatever.  You're really giving it to me, aren't you?  I apologize.  You fucked me over completely.  I haven't even started doing it.  All of a sudden, I think all of our listeners aren't feeling as bad as the bombings, about  the bombings in England today.  All right, hold on.  So, you've had many what?  Finish your thought.  I've had many situations like this happen to me in my life.  Where you give head because people just kind of come up to you?  No, not where I give head where I've been, like, cornered.  You just sit there and someone pulls a dead dick out and says, here you go, I hear you're 
[02:03:00]  good at this.  No, where I've been, like, cornered sexually.  Yeah?  You know, and I always found myself at that point, like, I'd freeze.  You should move out of the whole house.  You know, like, I didn't know what to do.  I mean, you hear so many of these things where if you don't give in, you know, you'll get  raped or something.  So, I think...  So, give in.  Yeah, so, give in.  Fuck it.  It's only another six.  Hey, you know what?  I walked away alive each time, so...  Ah, there you go.  I can't be all that wrong.  So, you got that going for you.  Wow.  It's so dick or be killed.  What else happened?  Give us one more experience like that. 
[02:03:30]  Okay, let's see.  I was at a bar.  I was around 20, 21.  She was 12?  I was at a bar.  I was talking to the bouncer.  Uh-huh.  And we were just, you know, talking and I was mingling and stuff like that.  It was towards the end of the night, closing, I went into the bathroom.  The next thing you know, somebody walked in, turned the lights off, locked the door, and,  again, cornered me.  Could you see it's just his teeth?  No, I knew who it was.  You know, when I turned around and I realized who it was, you know what I mean? 
[02:04:00]  I was like, what the fuck?  I mean, you know, again, what am I going to do?  So, you know, here I am.  I mean, I came to the bar by myself.  You guys weren't together then?  No, no.  This was long before.  So, you came to the bar by yourself.  This bouncer comes in.  I was like 20, 21.  Locks the door.  Yes, we were together.  Yeah, right?  I wish.  Locks the door.  Hi, teacher.  Locks the door.  And now what happened?  He pulled my skirt, pushed me up against the bathroom stall door.  Lifted the skirt up.  Lifted my skirt up.  Were you wearing panties? 
[02:04:30]  Probably not you, whore.  Yeah, of course I was wearing panties.  Yeah, I was wearing panties.  So, he pulls your panties down.  Yeah, pulls my pants down and gives it to me.  And starts fucking you.  And starts fucking me.  And then he just walked away.  Did you like it?  Turned around and walked away.  Did you like it?  Oh, I think at any moment where there's like sex involved, whether somebody doesn't want  it.  No, whether somebody doesn't want it or not.  There's a little bit of an arousal.  I mean, it was kind of exciting, but at the same time, it wasn't. 
[02:05:00]  Did he let loose inside you?  No.  No?  What did he do?  What about the black guy?  No, he just like did it on my ass.  He pulled out and did it on me.  Oh, you were turned around?  Yeah, I was turned around.  I was like this up against the back.  So, your face is to the wall.  So, he's banging it.  He pulled out and came on your ass.  Yeah, and then turned around and walked out the door.  Don't you love this?  And that was it.  That is fantastic.  And that was it.  And getting back to the black guy, did you swallow?  While Paul was downstairs with your little daughter?  You swallowed it, didn't you?  That cost me a lot of money to get that done. 
[02:05:30]  I'm married to her.  You swallowed it, didn't you?  Yeah, but sweetie, you know my rules.  What are the rules?  She wants me to get that sweet release shit, because apparently the British stuff tastes like  chlorine.  What the fuck?  It smells like chlorine.  I'm sorry, but I'm like a neat freak when it comes to...  She still goes in the swimming pool.  No, when it comes to hygiene, I am...  Don't go under water.  It smells like my dick.  He likes her cum to taste good.  You guys know any of that sweet release you used to advertise?  Wait, are you trying to say his...  I won't go down there if it stinks.  Sorry.  What? 
[02:06:00]  I won't.  And his stinks?  No, it's just like chlorine.  Oh, my God.  What?  I mean, have you ever heard of from under cheese?  She was.  Yeah, thanks.  Wow.  She wasn't going to try that sweet release.  You know that apple thing you guys used to advertise?  Yeah.  How was the black guys?  You want to know something?  I didn't taste anything.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  Fuck.  It must not have been too bad, because I was able to take it.  Was it chocolate sauce?  So what happened?  I just want to know.  You swallowed it now.  During the course of that same evening, did you guys kiss at all? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, God.  Well, I rinsed my mouth out and had a stiff drink afterwards.  So you got a stiff drink beforehand.  So hold on.  So then you blow the black guy.  Mm-hmm.  And you do whatever.  And then you go down to your daughter and your new boyfriend, Paul, there.  And you say nothing.  God, you're making it seem like I'm such a whore.  No, I'm just asking.  Thank you.  You are for that one.  Thank you.  Well, so are you, asswipe.  So, no, like, what happens afterwards?  You have to now go downstairs, and there's Paul and your daughter, right? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, and I mean, to tell you the truth, it was really hard, because in my mind, I  was, like, saying, holy fuck.  I bet it was really hard.  You know, guess what just happened to me?  You know what I mean?  And I couldn't come and say it, because, I mean, here's this famous guy, okay?  I mean, he's really well-known in England.  Is he really famous in England?  Yeah, he is.  He was in the number one soap in England.  Give us a comparable American actor that would be...  A top actor in a U.S. soap.  As famous.  Any soap.  A soap star.  Yeah.  Well, there's fewer channels in England, so their soap stars may be more famous than ours.  It was on regular TV, like Channel 4, equivalent of. 
[02:07:30]  It was on BBC.  He's probably more famous there than a soap guy would be here.  The BBC?  Yeah.  Wow, that's, uh...  So, like, John Black from Days of Our Lives or something.  Can you say his name?  That was his name.  Can I say his name?  Why not?  Yeah, we don't care.  What the hell?  Yeah, why not?  It's in England.  Who cares?  Well, actually, ironically, he's in the West End and he's supposed to come to Broadway to  do some show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, go ahead and say that motherfucker's name.  What's his name?  That's good.  Just give his first name.  Les, wasn't it?  No.  Des.  Des.  Des.  Alright, his first name's Des. 
[02:08:00]  There you go.  Yeah, it's a black guy with a British accent.  Fucking confusing.  Hello, I'm looking for a guy that speaks like this.  It can't be you, Mr. Black Man.  Can I talk to the white man?  Oh, hello, that's me.  We've learned a lot here from these two.  We certainly have.  Christ, maybe the phone's going to be better.  Paul and Denise.  Put the phones on shit.  Wow.  All you've got to do is find her in a bathroom and...  She's a good egg.  Why do you think we wanted the bathroom?  Thank you.  Hey, you know what?  I do my community service.  Well, you're very, uh...  Because people are asking.  You're very voluptuous.  You've got the... 
[02:08:30]  Voluptuous.  You've got the...  Thank you.  Yes, I'm proud of my 36 double D.  They're real.  36 double Ds that are just sitting there.  Voluptuous.  What do you want to see?  Mocking everybody.  Hey, I told him if you guys asked, I would show him.  All right, you might as well show us your boobs in front of Paul.  All right, you want to see them?  There you go, there you go.  Jesus, 44-year-old boobs.  Wow.  Really?  Those are 44-year-old boobs.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  Yes.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Didn't even have to go to the bathroom to see those.  See?  Well, I'm going to tell you.  You've got to go to the bathroom and stick a dick between them. 
[02:09:00]  Jimmy thinks I don't know, but I know she emailed a picture of him a while ago.  Did you send me your boobs?  I don't remember.  Yes, I did.  I don't remember.  I sent you a picture of me wearing the girl's baby doll.  Eat a bullet dot com t-shirt with a fucking set of tits.  Oh, gee, what are they looking at?  Oh, I'm going to order a t-shirt.  I kept telling, put them up.  That'll sell.  That's not a bad thing to send all that.  Yeah, it actually would sell.  Wow.  It doesn't have my face, so I don't care.  Ironically, Jimmy's got some respect for me.  So anything else?  Yeah, you think so?  No, not really. 
[02:09:30]  I wouldn't trust him as far as he could throw.  I've got a rod right now.  Yeah?  Do you?  Yeah.  You're looking at Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Anything else you guys want to get off your big chest?  Yes.  No, could we leave now?  Yes, no, no, no.  I have been trying to get out with this girl who was crippled.  What?  You want to go back to the crippled girl?  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to get empty.  Oh, there's a detail we don't know about?  Yeah, there's a little detail.  When they went on their little Boston escapade together. 
[02:10:00]  Boston?  You missed that part of the story.  Well, yeah, because we never got to it.  She went to Boston like a couple of months later.  Anyway, he gets up.  He goes to the bathroom to find that he can't go back into the room because she had an accident  in the bed.  Yeah, don't come back in.  It's a little bit runny in here.  Oh, my.  And this was an ensuite bathroom, too, so I had, like, no options at that point.  I'm like, okay, how long would I have to wait here?  The crippled girl shit in the bed.  How'd you forget that part of the story? 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  Oh, man.  I had years of therapy to block it out.  That's the Kaiser Soze reveal of the story.  You guys owe me a lot of money.  $20,000 worth of therapy.  You guys owe me.  I have to go through again now to block that shit out.  Literally.  Wait, you guys had what?  What?  You had what?  Had you had sex with her that night?  Yeah, I think that's what dislodged it.  Were you anal?  No.  Oh, you had sex.  Then you went to the bathroom?  Might have been.  Who the fuck knows?  I wasn't looking.  You guys have had what?  Therapy?  No, no, no.  I'm just saying I should have had therapy to forget the shit in the bed thing. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Right, of course.  Let me clear that one up before you go down that road.  That's hilarious.  You were in Boston.  You had sex with her.  And then she shit alone.  On the bed.  What'd she say from the bed?  She said you can't come back out now.  And then, like, I kind of figured out later what had happened.  And you said why?  Hold on.  The maid's coming through.  She'll be 20 minutes.  Stay in the bathroom.  Why was the maid coming through?  For what?  You asshole.  I know.  You fuck her.  He's special with my speech now.  Why?  For rude.  Why was she coming through? 
[02:11:30]  To change the bed.  What excuse did she give you, I'm saying?  Oh, she just said something happened.  She didn't, like, specify.  Something happened.  Yeah.  Which, at that point, there's not many possibilities, really.  Yeah, you gotta think about it.  I just got feeling back in my leg.  Stay in the bathroom.  I fell off the bed and the futon went up my snatch.  It's so baggy because there's no muscles holding it together.  She gets famous actors and you're getting shitting crippled. 
[02:12:00]  That's wonderful.  Yeah, and the worst part is the actors were all my friends, past tense fuckers.  Wow.  Let's go to the floor.  Is that your friend, that soap star?  Well, then, until I found this out afterwards.  So you want him to get sweet release?  Yeah, apparently.  I told him that I would take it any day if it tasted right.  She takes it after a bottle of Chambord, but apparently with Negroes that are famous,  she just...  All it takes is a bathroom stall.  I think it's just a situation.  And a Diet Coke.  No, because I used to...  How humble?  Here I am.  I'm going to let something else out again. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Oh, her ex-husband.  Oh, I want to go back to this.  No, no.  Her ex-husband is a huge Peter Gabriel fan, and he came out and said,  you can fuck Peter Gabriel anytime you want.  No, that's not what I was going to say.  So I'm going to go back to this back in famous people.  I was going to talk about blowjobs and give them.  All right.  What were you going to say?  Sorry.  Okay, no, I was going to say...  How big was the black guy, by the way?  I would probably say about a good 10 inches.  Five foot seven?  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, he was big and wide.  I was like, whoa.  Just holding the arms like two feet apart.  You really enjoyed that.  Yeah, I did.  You know, what the hell? 
[02:13:00]  What the hell?  What the hell?  I didn't have to play to have a wisdom teeth took out after that job.  It's just fat on the floor.  No, I'm just saying, I always found it easy to, I guess, swallow in weird places, like situations.  I mean, when you're like...  Like the back of your throat?  No, like when you're doing it at home.  No, listen, when you're doing it at home, you know you've got to do it.  Call from Notting Hill.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, and you're like, you're sitting there, and you wait to the point, and it kind of like  just takes it out of, you know...  But when you're in the bathroom...  But when you're in the bathroom, or you're in like a public place... 
[02:13:30]  Sperm of the moment.  ...or somewhere, yeah, it's like arousing, and you don't think about it.  Arousing.  Now, you brought up two instances where that happened.  Well, there was one more.  Was there another one?  You might as well get them all out then.  I was like 19.  This is all before I met her, though.  I was 19.  I was managing a shoe store, and my district manager, he had the hots for me.  Yeah.  And she went in a race.  And he, uh...  Al Bundy.  Well, he, uh, you know...  Exactly.  He kind of, like, asked me to, like, give him a blowjob in the back stockroom.  Such this equals $5 more a week. 
[02:14:00]  Asked you?  Well, he kind of, like...  Yeah, he asked me.  I mean, you know, we were, like, into some heavy petting, and the next thing you know, he's  got my head, and he's pushing it down.  You've got his head.  You know, and he's pushing it down there, and I just dropped on my knees and took care of  business.  Wow.  You know?  Hey, it got me...  What a good employee.  I know, really.  That's right.  It got me...  Yeah, how old the guy was he?  It got me a head.  He was actually...  He was married, and he was...  And what was his name?  What was his name, please?  You want to know something?  I don't even remember.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure. 
[02:14:30]  Was it?  Joey.  What name did the check say on him?  Joey.  Joey.  His name was Joey.  That's all I'm going to say.  And how old the guy was he?  He's married.  How old was he?  Yeah.  Oh, he was, like, in his late 20s.  Late 20s.  Yeah.  So he gets you back in the stockroom, and you drop to your knees.  And that was right before I was marrying...  I wasn't married yet.  I was just engaged.  It was that week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, you know, I really seem like a slapper, don't I?  You're such a bike.  Well...  It's a British thing.  Did you measure his cock with that shoe measuring thing?  It was all hard.  Make fun of it. 
[02:15:00]  Look how wide it is.  Yeah, he took a narrow...  He had a narrow width.  Did you swallow with him or no?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  I did.  I don't...  For some reason, I can do with everybody else, but I can't do it with him.  Why?  It must be this English thing.  I don't know.  So you must miss swallowing, huh?  I don't know.  I'd have bent you over and shoehorned my cock into her ass.  I don't know if I missed it.  You weren't just, uh...  Here we are.  This will fit.  It's a little smug.  Walk around with it.  See how it feels.  Pull it out.  It looks like a Buster Brown.  Hey.  We can't let our daughters listen to this.  Some poor little kid buys some Batman slippers and wonder why one of them sticks to his foot. 
[02:15:30]  That's funny.  Holy shit.  This guy's a class act.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian and Dallas.  He's negative.  Brian, let's go.  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to know what bar she hangs out in.  What's that?  What bar?  I want to know what bar she hangs out in.  You corner her.  Same one as your mom.  Oh.  Oh, hey, Paul.  TJ on Long Island.  I'm just kidding.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm that bouncer, man. 
[02:16:00]  Ah!  That was me 20 years ago.  Are you fucking serious?  No, you idiot.  No, you're not.  You're not.  You're not.  You're not.  Because the asshole gave me craps, too.  Oh, shit.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  TJ, you're just joking, right?  Yeah, I invented bathroom rape, Robin.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, sir.  Hoo-hoo.  Well, JV from Westfield, Jersey says, if this chick wasn't such a slut, she would have been  raped three times.  And this guy gave you craps?  Halfway through fucking, she says, ah, okay, and then they just don't rape anymore.  Officer, why don't you tell them how you lost your virginity? 
[02:16:30]  You want to get into it.  Is that the guy?  No, that ain't even a nice story.  I know it's not.  That's what I'm saying.  That's, that's, that's, that's.  Turn that monitor around.  Have them confirm.  That's fucked up.  Yes.  Yep, that's him.  Wow.  He's a high-class Negro.  Looks like Will Smith.  He's a little from here.  I was going to say, it looks like Will Smith, yeah.  It's a little pencil, uh, mustache.  So which guy gave you a craps?  The shoe store?  No.  Or the bouncer?  The fucking bouncer in the bar.  The bouncer in the bar bathroom gave you a craps.  And the funny story of it is, is like, a couple weeks later, he wound up dating my 
[02:17:00]  sister.  You know what's really fucked up?  What?  She's the hot sister.  Yeah.  Normally you'd think you'd upgrade, but I guess there's actually a sister in her family that's  more slutty than her, would you believe?  Wow, really?  Hey, I'm not a slut, alright?  You're slutty.  I'm not a slut.  I'm not a slut, and I just blew 15 guys in the last 10 minutes you've talked about. 
[02:17:30]  Yes, you are.  Or you were.  How could you say I'm not a slut after talking about six bathroom rapes that you liked?  I bet you.  And went back two more times.  I bet you that there are other girls out there, okay, who have found themselves in  the same situation and have probably done the same thing.  And they're pressing charges against Kobe Bryant as we speak.  Kobe Bryant wrote a check to the last one.  Wow.  Yes, and my problem is I don't get paid for it. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, the fucking mortgage doesn't count, guys.  You know that?  Wow.  Wow.  Man.  I had a question, now I don't even remember.  Obviously it wasn't that important.  Where were we?  There was something going on there.  The bouncer gave you crabs.  Yeah, crabs.  Yeah, he gave me crabs.  And then he fucked his sister and gave her crabs, too?  Did we miss that part?  I don't know, but my boyfriend from college thought he gave it to me.  Yeah.  So I let him think it.  She didn't clear that one up.  She didn't say, hi, I'm a slut.  She said, I'm the only one that you fucked in ten years.  He was an ass.  How did he think he gave it to you unless he was fucking somebody else? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Because he was, right?  Exactly.  He was up at college.  I wouldn't know any better.  The fact there was no argument for him trying to give that away.  I was always faithful.  She was faithful except for sucking cock.  Always faithful.  I was.  Let me tell you something.  I was always faithful to these guys.  It's not cheating unless it's anal.  Is that true?  Yeah, whatever.  Fuck off, all right?  You don't even want to go there because I could start shit on you, babe.  Before we're married, let's keep that in back then.  Yeah, you better fight back because you're losing the battle here.  Yeah.  Ball's getting the upper hand.  Let me tell you something.  I got some shit on him, okay?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  So did the cripple girl.  If I was to let it out, it would destroy him.  It would destroy his job, so.  Yeah.  Destroy his job?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, babe.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, tell that story right after I get a new job, okay?  He wasn't jerking off in a bed with Rich Voss, was he?  No.  Now, this was a paying job.  Yeah.  He was paying his dues.  Was another guy involved?  No.  That I'd like to see.  That's not going to happen.  Oh, my God.  I always thought that most women don't want to see that.  No, because he goes on and on about me having sex with a girl.  That's hot. 
[02:19:30]  So I said to him, I said, hey, that's fine.  You know what?  You want that?  Then I want to see you blow another guy.  So, obviously, I'm never going to see lesbianism ever.  Yeah.  Because there's no fucking way any ball bags will come up with me.  Hey, equal.  Well, maybe you'll be in a bathroom.  Yeah, that's right.  Maybe I can get one of those fucking scary movie masks and say, hello, I'm from down by  the river.  Fucking sales, you'll blow me.  Your husband's outside.  Oh, you know.  Oh, you're fucking dead.  She's been a good girl since she's been married, as far as I know. 
[02:20:00]  I have.  I've been very faithful to you.  What does very faithful mean?  Is there anything better than very faithful?  How about completely faithful?  Very faithful.  I only slid once a week.  What does very faithful mean?  I have been fairly faithful.  Those days are gone and behind me.  So was that guy in the fucking bar.  Let's go to Dan on Rhode Island.  Dan somewhere.  All right, hold on a second there. 
[02:20:30]  Dan, go ahead.  Dan.  Hey, I got a question for the broad.  Yeah.  I was wondering if I came down to the studio, if she could suck my dick for me while I kicked  her faggot-limey boyfriend's teeth out of his mouth.  You're getting confused.  Wow.  Husband, sweetheart.  Husband.  The faggots are the French who just got kicked out of the Olympics, so fuck off.  Let's go to Rooster.  Sorry, I don't do charity anymore.  Rooster the trucker.  What's up, Rooster?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  Hey, I nailed this chick whose legs were cut off, and I thought I had a good story. 
[02:21:00]  And you thought you had a good story?  Yeah.  I thought I had one talk with some of these guys, man.  I'm telling you what.  Girl with no legs, huh?  How long had they been cut off?  Did he cut him off with the truck before he met him?  No, no, no.  Trying to catch him?  No, she had him cut off in some kind of car accident.  You weren't driving, though, right?  You talk about uncomfortable trying to not make eye contact with them nubs.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Hey, I'm punching out.  You guys have a good day. 
[02:21:30]  You too.  Let's say hi to JR.  JR?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, you know, blowjobs are just like handshakes.  There's no cheating involved, though.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Oh, it's just like saying hi, how do you do?  Thank you, Mr. President.  All right.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Actual audio from the bathroom, I see.  Drop it.  I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town.  That was me when I found out right there. 
[02:22:00]  I wish you guys get that recording.  There's a live-  Hold it.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  I think you already got it.  Wow.  You guys are a class act.  Oh, God.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, hey, what do we do now?  Should we just take a break?  I got a tinkle.  I got a tinkle.  I have to take her in the bathroom.  Yeah, Jimmy's going in the bathroom first.  Take her to the bathroom.  You better watch, Jimmy. 
[02:22:30]  How long is this break?  We get two minutes each.  You know, we might take a-  A 20-minute break.  I might need an escort.  I don't know what happened.  I went into the bathroom.  Next thing, I had a cock in my mouth.  You know what?  I just slipped and fell onto your dick.  All right, why don't we just take a break?  All right.  When we get back, Paul and his lovely wife, Jimmy.  Hey, you know-  You just fucked yourself over completely there.  Paul and the woman he's putting up with.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  She's a good girl. 
[02:23:00]  She's a good girl, though.  You're lucky that you have somebody, okay?  So experience-  He looks as good as me.  Ugly fucking geek.  I'm going to get some shoe polish and put it on my cock and see if she'll blow me in  the bathroom, man.  See you guys after the break.  Wash it first.  Oh, wow.  I got to tell you, this could be the funniest hour we've done on XM.  I got to tell you.  I love it.  Well, I love the stories.  I guess we won't be in one of those best-offs, then, will we? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  It will be.  That is funny.  Wow.  Wow.  I hope he's-  You have sex with anyone else that was famous?  No.  Famous at any time?  No, but I told Jimmy if he ever wanted to, you know.  Yeah.  Right, babes?  I can't do it, though, because my merchandise will all wind up fucking sent to the wrong  place.  Yeah.  3,000 people suing me.  I'm only kidding.  I'm a good girl.  I'm totally faithful to my date. 
[02:24:00]  All six of them that's left.  Oh, my God.  How many people have you had sex with in your life, you think, Denise?  Total?  Yeah.  Last time I asked her, it was 29.  I'm hoping it hasn't gone up.  No, I wouldn't say 29, maybe 23.  About 23?  About 23, yeah.  And everyone lowballs that number one ass, so.  Well, lowballing doesn't count, apparently.  I know.  I would definitely say probably around 23.  Blowing count? 
[02:24:30]  The night number?  Does that have interest?  Yeah, like, is that just...  Is that full-on fucking?  I mean, that's not even serious relationships.  I mean, relationships, I'd probably say maybe I was in maybe about five.  How many two-point conversions?  Hey.  We're talking clerks rules here.  Let's talk about you, sweetheart.  How many of you had, huh?  I've never given or received...  Well, actually, I've given anal to you.  That's about it.  Let me clear that one up.  Very carefully.  See?  So, one.  That champagne cost me a ton of money.  Yeah, right. 
[02:25:00]  Wow.  Okay, then, play music.  Break, break, break.  No, we're just taking a breath here.  Taking it all in.  Yeah, I need one.  I need a fall.  God, I look like a real slapper.  Slapper?  You just sound like one to everyone in Radio Land.  We'll play this technical version PSA as we go to break.  Yeah, right.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal sex. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two.  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future.  The virus is ready.  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone. 
[02:26:00]  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly,  the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus. 
[02:26:30]  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Fox News is, the official report out of England is two dead and a couple hundred injuries. 
[02:27:00]  Now, Fox is reporting through Sky News that at least 45 are dead  and 1,000 injuries with 150 serious in the London explosions.  I'm sorry, sorry, Jimmy.  Fox is probably right.  Because on the tsunami count, they were the ones, if I remember correctly,  they were the ones that were going up first.  It was like they kept finding out.  They kept giving them much higher, much higher counts. 
[02:27:30]  They turned out to be correct.  And there's still people trapped underground on the subways, they're saying.  Wow.  This is going to be a biggie.  I bet you there's no more than 100 dead.  I don't mean that that's nothing, but considering it's an all-out rush hour Al-Qaeda attack,  London may have gotten off.  And how about this, too?  Al-Qaeda in Iraq says it's killed Egypt's top envoy in Iraq.  Remember, this guy was kidnapped a few days back.  It was Egypt's envoy to Iraq, the guy that was pretty much opening up relationships  between Iraq's new government and Egypt, and they snatched him off the street, 
[02:28:00]  yelling, you're an American spy, American spy, and now killed him.  I wonder if they beheaded him or shot him, fucking Al-Zarqawi.  Isn't that wonderful?  Oh, I got a smoothie menu.  Opie, I'm getting a smoothie.  I'm so excited.  You should not get a smoothie.  Why?  Do you know how many germs are in smoothies?  No.  I don't care about germs.  Oh, by the way, because people are wondering, Paul's wife is still in the bathroom. 
[02:28:30]  Uh-oh.  Everybody left to go to the bathroom.  They left her in here, and then everyone else left, so just I was in here.  And she sucked my cock.  I just got it.  All right, let's go on.  Paul, your wife's still in the bathroom.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, there's a line.  See, it's not fair.  I like you guys.  I like Andy's girlfriend, so I'm not going to be nasty.  It's not fair.  I'm having...  I want the strawberry, banana, orange, non-fat yogurt, and low-fat milk smoothie. 
[02:29:00]  Is that in order for my wife in the bathroom, or is that actually food?  She's getting a smoothie in her face.  Yes, really.  Here it is.  There it is, sir.  Denise.  Why are you saying shh?  I don't know.  I was told to shut up.  She wasn't shushing.  She was wiping something off her lip.  No, just spitting out.  Holy crap, you're quick, bro.  Paul is quick. 
[02:29:30]  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  I have a request.  I want Paul to make New York the sexiest state.  I live in New Jersey, tall.  I want...  I want...  I want to make London the sexiest state.  I want...  I want the fat chicks instead of the people that got hurt today.  I want you to have oral in the studio.  Oh, you want to know something?  I swear to God, I had this feeling something like that was going to be...  Show us what you got.  Not a bad idea.  Prove it.  We don't want to see Paul's junk, but speak for yourself. 
[02:30:00]  Maybe...  I don't want to hear...  Did you want to go in the pictures, Wink?  Let's see what we can negotiate here.  Thank you, Greg.  I don't want to hear stories.  I want actual proof.  No, the stories are great, actually.  Maybe you could go under the console to see if he's even in shape to get a little BJ.  I'm not one of those public guys.  Nothing's going to happen over here.  No, she goes under the console.  No one sees nothing.  I'm going to sit there smiling at you guys.  We're just...  Someone's tickling my boss.  We're just...  She's ready to go, I can tell. 
[02:30:30]  Jimmy, I'm giving you the car blonde.  She can go under your desk.  Ooh.  You're allowing me to do that?  Okay, I get a credit.  Jimmy's hooking me up.  Wow.  No transects.  Oh, yeah?  If we get that going on, that could be kind of interesting.  I can't, because if he ever regrets it, I'll have fucking thousands of dollars worth of  merchandise flushed down a fucking floor.  Somewhere in Fork and River.  No, we'd never do that.  It wouldn't say, I stink anymore, that's for sure.  It wouldn't say, I suck.  I think you guys already have an agreement that she could do him. 
[02:31:00]  No, Paul's policy is this.  If you touch it, you buy it.  And I don't care how much money you have, after getting that apartment, you don't have  enough left.  So you want to at least go...  Are you saying she's expensive?  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  I paid my house off, I still got a mortgage, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I don't spend unless he allows me to.  I am.  I'm a good girl like that.  Sure.  All right, can we mic Denise?  She's going to go into the console, just to see what's going on down there, the smells.  Go by, Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're going by, not me. 
[02:31:30]  Wait a second.  No, sweetheart, I am married to you, all right?  I'm not doing anything that's going to come back on me, sweetie.  It's got to be Paul.  Nothing's getting on zip over here.  It's got to be him.  He's my husband.  Paul, we could set you up where no one sees shit.  You don't have to unzip it, she's just rubbing your mule.  I just want the reaction.  That's okay.  I just want Denise's reaction when she goes down there to see what's going on, because  you said it stinks and all that.  Oh, God.  Wait a second.  Well, he showered this morning, so.  All right, well.  He did shower this morning.  All right, can we mic her somehow?  Yes, yes, we're doing it.  You guys are killing me. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, you got the thing?  The liberator.  I'm not a fag, and I'm on a liberator.  Eventually, we're going to get to some more news with these two.  We're just getting out of the microphone set.  Oh, is that why we were here?  Let's demonstrate mom's technique.  Yeah, dude, you don't teach your daughters how to give BJs, do you?  No.  Like your mom did?  No.  They're too young, right?  No, just full penetration and hitting the G-spot.  I have one daughter who's 18.  You have a daughter, but you're not going to do what your mom did, right? 
[02:32:30]  No.  No.  No.  The only thing I tell my daughters is just be safe, know what you're doing, and I tell  them, don't get yourself in situations that I got in.  Get the cash up front.  Don't forget, mommy's 10%.  You've got to be kidding me.  I'm supposed to hold this big thing?  No, no.  That was in a bathroom in the village, wasn't it, with that Negro?  All right, she's talking about the mic when she's...  Yeah, let's clear that one up quickly. 
[02:33:00]  Quickly?  Wow.  All right.  All right, now what am I supposed to do here?  Whatever you want.  You're just going to go onto the console and see what's going on down there.  And then see if I can give it...  Listen, she obviously likes giving BJs.  That's very obvious.  And it sounds like she hasn't really given one in a long time.  Department of Youth and Family Services are looking up our address right now.  My kids are not listening to this.  Yeah, that's why the XM's on 202 at the house recording this right now on the Wi-Fi. 
[02:33:30]  Just blasting through the house.  I'm just going to get in there.  Blasting through the house.  Is there any way we can push him back?  Because I don't think I can get in there.  You look at the little kid with his feet sticking straight off the liberator.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, listen, Paul, you've got to be a good sport.  We really don't want to see your junk.  But she's got to get in there and see what's going on.  So you want to get a sheet or something?  How are we going to do this?  What?  A sheet.  I don't know.  That's because he's afraid to...  They can video if it's not being unzipped.  No videotape.  Don't worry about that.  All right, baby.  Go on.  Lay down.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  So now we've got Denise in front of Paul, her husband.  Oh.  She's...  Lay down.  Can I get a microphone?  Okay.  All right.  There she goes.  She's now kneeling between his legs.  All right, we've got a mic, Denise, too.  Get that mic in front of her there.  She's already told me the price.  There's nothing else she's going to say.  You will be paying for this later.  Trust me, baby.  All right.  Wait.  Do we want to cover up Paul?  Because Paul...  Yeah, get a sheet.  I'm sure Paul's got one in his suitcase somewhere. 
[02:34:30]  Like the pointy white hat he wears.  Okay.  A conglomerated.  A lot of fun girl.  I can't do anything over your pants.  It's good enough.  Trust me.  No, that's what...  Nothing's going to happen with some...  Nothing's happening, man.  Kid Toucher and two frigging radio people on the 60s looking at us.  I just feel like a pile of junk here, you know, both squishy and...  Come on, baby.  I don't know where you come from, but I thought you used your mouth.  Maybe that's why it's so successful.  You want me to use my mouth on a pair of pants? 
[02:35:00]  Whatever.  No, no.  We've got to do the real thing.  So you've got to cover them with something.  He's...  I'd probably do it if I was him, either.  I can't do anything.  Get something that will cover his whole lower half and her head and everything.  So she looks like one of those, like, 19th century photographers or something, where  you've got to put the blanket over your head and...  Yeah, that's a great idea, actually.  Paul, trust me, no one wants to see that, so we're just going to cover both of you so  we can get something going on here.  Definitely nobody wants to see that. 
[02:35:30]  No.  Wow, you are really...  That's positive, isn't it?  You know, she sounded so upbeat about the black guy's penis.  No, no.  Let me tell you something.  I'm very content and very happy with what I've got at home.  Yeah?  Yes, definitely.  She makes the deposits.  And I will say this.  No, no.  I will say this.  No guy who I've ever been with can please me like Paul.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a platinum card.  You know, that's why we're...  No!  That's why we're as long together as we have been. 
[02:36:00]  A couple little things in the bathroom are pleasing, but not as pleasing.  No, no, no.  Hey, that's past tense.  Right.  I'm very happy with him.  All right, we're...  Okay, and then let's do the news now.  No, we're stalling because we're...  We're trying to find a sheet or something.  Steve's opening up cabinets.  He's looking for things.  We don't have a sheet?  We don't have, like, a tarp, anything?  Ah, there we go.  What is that?  What is that?  It's Ben's condom.  Oh, we...  Ben's condom.  Oh, look, and we got a big...  Wow.  Thank you, Mars.  Mars to the rescue.  Mars brings in a big black...  I'm not doing it yet.  Big black sheet. 
[02:36:30]  All right, let's get him under the black sheet.  Well, it says wow on it.  Or something.  Jesus Christ.  Well, now, you...  You can go all the way now that this is covered.  You can do whatever.  It ain't covered yet.  All right, cover up.  Wait, don't smother them.  Give them some air.  No, that's good.  Hold on, they're still moving sheets around.  There's a ghost blowing them in.  There's a black ghost.  All right, well...  A spook.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, let's... 
[02:37:00]  Not too bad today.  Not too bad today?  Wait, what do you mean?  What do you mean?  Meaning, like...  It tastes like chocolate, I guess.  Fuck.  All right, what's going on, Denise?  Make sure she's completely mic'd.  Does she have a headphone on?  No, I don't.  I don't have nothing on.  But you're not moving the sheet to put them on.  I'll tell you that right now.  You want to hand me something on Denise, Thor?  It's all right.  Nothing's going to happen with ten guys with microphones and cameras pointing on my face.  Sorry, I could never be in porn.  Sorry, Steve. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  Denise, what's going on in there?  Well, I'm trying.  Let's listen in.  I'm trying to...  She's under the sheet, obviously.  Get him a bit aroused, but I think he's a bit nervous.  A bit nervous?  I never have this problem at home.  Give it to your best, and let's listen in.  I'm on the Opeani show.  Which went from reading the news to my wife blowing me on the console.  How does it smell?  You want me to tell...  What?  How does it smell?  You said he had a nasty smell.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It kind of smells like fresh washed trout. 
[02:38:00]  What the fuck?  Fresh washed.  There's definitely nothing happening under here now.  You might as well just take the camera away.  It's not going to happen.  It doesn't matter.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Everyone be quiet.  Let's...  She's such a lying twat.  She doesn't make any of these noises at home.  She just chings the coins together as I pay her. 
[02:38:30]  This is all her.  There's the stuff in hand.  I got some guy with a teddy bear shirt holding a Sony point at me.  What the fuck?  It's going to get off.  Steve.  You're not 12 inches.  What the fuck?  What?  Who else has a bear shirt, Jimmy?  You have to explain that.  Good point.  Why don't you just shut your eyes and relax.  Make believe you're not here.  Yeah, really.  And I look, I wake up when the sheet's gone and there's five people laughing.  Just relax and make sure you guys are alone.  She's working on that pigtail you call a cock. 
[02:39:00]  The best part is the sheet's going up and down right now.  Yeah.  Up and down, up and down.  Oh, this is not going to...  Well, it's working a little.  It's all right.  Ah, there you go.  It's not going to go...  Looks like a scene out of Abu Ghraib.  I'm getting...  With a sheet on her head.  I'm getting blown and all I can see is some kid touching her with headphones.  And that's Jimmy, by the way, in case you can just play.  Denise, how's it going down there?  It's going okay for me.  I don't know about him.  Oh, keep going. 
[02:39:30]  You fuckers.  I got set up so bad.  Oh, come in and read the news.  Yeah, how terrible.  We're getting you blown.  That's awful.  But I can get this at home when I haven't got to have guys watch me.  That's true.  I'm taking credit for his wife blowing them.  Yeah.  Listen to you.  Wow, the head's really moving up.  I know.  The sheet's moving up and down really fast.  Still nothing happening.  I'm looking at...  I've got Andy, Opie, Jimmy, Steve, and...  Steve, you got to get...  Eric and Nathaniel, I think. 
[02:40:00]  He's not holding a sign and getting some chink fired.  What's going on, now?  He's behind with the wow sign right behind me.  You getting any action there whatsoever happening?  It ain't going to work.  Sorry, guys.  I just like...  That's pretty sad, Paul.  Why is it sad?  I've got ten guys looking at me and Steve holding a Sony looking at me.  What the fuck?  Yeah, but they're...  All right, Denise, why don't you give it the old college try?  Here we go.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, my God.  She's moving now. 
[02:40:30]  She's moving up and down really fast.  Hear that at home?  That's the sheet.  Eric, why are you telling me to shut up?  She's biting my balls.  You guys don't get laid at home, do you?  I swear to God.  What's wrong with you people?  Where's that waiver I signed?  I need to destroy it.  Actually, I didn't just sign one for this fucker.  I don't think so. 
[02:41:00]  Ouch.  Oh, look, a terror alert.  There's nothing going to happen here.  It doesn't matter how good you are.  She's trying.  I got my heroes looking at me getting blown.  Come on, what is this?  I feel like a groupie.  What the fuck?  She looks like she's from Iraq with the black sheet over her.  The burka.  The burka.  That's great.  Would a burka be an improvement from a wheelchair? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  All right, we can give up now.  There's nothing going on here.  Nothing.  Denise?  Denise, you can...  Huh?  He knocks on her head.  She's under the blanket.  He's like, Denise knocks on her head.  But she just goes, anyone home?  She doesn't want to give up.  No, she's going to have to.  Yeah, nothing going on there.  Denise, nothing?  You look like Taliban.  Mm-mm.  All right, come on.  No.  No.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy, have a turn.  All right, get out of there, Denise.  Let me jump in.  I knew that was coming.  Can we zip it up before you... 
[02:42:00]  Something's coming.  All right.  Wow.  What was going on in there, Denise?  Denise?  Well, it was kind of like...  You know those little water worms that slide in your hand back and forth?  That doesn't sound good.  You know?  With those little...  Yeah, it doesn't sound good.  It was like that.  It was like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard with people watching.  Of course you were.  That was the problem.  It wasn't.  Well, actually...  Paul doesn't have a problem with that, because there's another story I can tell you.  They have to have vaginas.  Wait, you got one more?  No, no, no.  Eric, give her the mic, please. 
[02:42:30]  Do you have another story you can tell?  Yeah.  Well, actually, one time when we were dating, Paul thought that he would be a little bit of  an exhibitionist, and he took me in front of one of his friends.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Had sex with you?  Mm-hmm.  In front of one of his friends?  A guy friend?  Yes, male friend.  That's weird.  The best man from our wedding, ironically.  Wait, how did that come about?  I can't even remember.  Oh, God.  I think it involved a cash payment to me.  Yeah, something that I didn't know about.  Oh, you didn't know that the other guy was looking at? 
[02:43:00]  I didn't know what was going to happen.  No, we were all just hanging out at the house, and the guy's just laying back on the couch,  you know, just relaxing.  We're on the floor, you know, and we're just hugging each other and stuff like that.  Next thing you know, he's all over me, and he's, you know, pushing himself on top  of me, and I'm like, Paul, you know, the guy's right there, and he's like,  oh, so what, you know, and there he is.  He's, you know, doing me in front of his best friend.  His best friend was pretending to sleep.  I thought he was asleep.  No, I don't think he was asleep. 
[02:43:30]  That's my out.  I think you knew.  That's my out right there.  I think he was a male thing, you know?  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so, you know.  That's a little gay.  Well, he didn't touch him.  He didn't touch him.  I don't have sex and have a guy watching.  I know, right?  Well, believe me.  All right, Jimmy, I know you don't agree.  No, no, no, I don't think it's a gay thing, though, because I've been on a few trains  myself, which, you know, and sometimes you're showing off, but it doesn't mean you want  the other guy to touch your dick or show him your dick.  All right, let's...  I think that's the way you're showing off.  Yeah, Jimmy had both tickled his balls. 
[02:44:00]  Well, he knew also that the guy wanted me.  He knew that the guy also had, like, a crush on me and stuff like that.  Well, that isn't the first time it happened, right?  There was also the guy...  Oh, that was only the first time, yeah.  No, the guy watching that you usually give a buck to, and he gives you a mint and dries  your hands.  Yeah, really?  No?  No.  All right, let's go to John.  The washroom attendant.  I liked it.  Let's go to John in Oklahoma.  John, go ahead.  Hold on, hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  Go ahead, John.  You guys have been the most exciting 30 minutes I've seen, or heard, in forever. 
[02:44:30]  I've been sitting at my office waiting to go inside until the boner would go down.  Oh, you thought the last hour was hot.  Hot.  I'm telling you, it was exciting.  All right, very good.  So go in your office, go in the bathroom, find a secretary.  We found some keepers.  Paul and Denise are keepers.  There are people coming on our show.  We know that it's one and done, and we'll never see them again, but these two will be  back.  Just leave it like that for now.  We're going to take a break in a second.  All right, why don't we do this, Ant?  We're going to regroup.  We'll break, and then they're going to finally do the news for us, John and Denise. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, that's why they came out.  John and Denise.  John.  Why am I saying John?  Paul.  Paul.  Where did John?  Oh, John.  John, Paul.  Oh, Ringo, George.  Jesus, yeah, right?  I thought it was a hooker reference.  I was just thinking that.  John, Jesus.  I'm not many John.  I know, Paul.  I'm sorry I did that.  Okay, as we go to break, Anthony, one of our pals was on Conan O'Brien last night.  Yeah.  Oh, my smoothie's here.  I just wonder how much I owe him.  I already paid the tall fetus.  Jimmy! 
[02:45:30]  Thank you.  All right, as we go to break.  A smoothie.  One of our favorites, Brian Regan was on Conan O'Brien.  Hey.  So why don't we take a listen to part of his set or most of his set or all of his set?  I don't know.  Just by...  Oh, you got it.  Listen to this.  Hey.  All right.  Thank you very much.  So I flew out here and the security area at the airport.  What is the deal with the businessmen who make way too big a deal out of their computers? 
[02:46:00]  You ever hear these guys?  Excuse me, I have a computer.  I have a computer here.  I don't know how you're going to handle this.  My computer.  Oh, is he from the future?  It better run a while, pal.  I want to do that with an extra sketch, you know?  Excuse me, my laptop.  I need a new computer, man.  I know that they've made some advances since I got mine. 
[02:46:30]  My friend has a new one, and it anticipates what you're writing.  He let me work on this thing.  I had never seen a computer that anticipates what you're writing.  I write, M-O-N.  The screen pops up.  Monday?  Yeah, Monday.  F-E-B.  February?  Write again, Kemosabe.  It looks like I'm trying to write a letter.  Do you need help?  Yeah, write the damn thing. 
[02:47:00]  I go home to work on mine.  Mine tries.  It's not very bright, I guess.  And I write, M-O-N.  Mongoose?  Monday.  F-E-B.  Fabrice Fabric Freshener?  February.  February.  It looks like I'm trying to write the Magna Carta.  Do you need help? 
[02:47:30]  I can write my own Magna Carta.  I'm not smart enough, man.  How do you get smart?  I've been trying to watch this Nova thing on PBS.  Have you seen this thing?  They had a thing on string theory I was watching that.  I started watching that at 8 p.m.  And at 8.03, my brain exploded.  They said string theory is the stuff that the physicists are figuring out now that Albert Einstein was not able to nail down in his theories. 
[02:48:00]  So I'm thinking, well, if Albert Einstein didn't understand it, me on the couch with a bag of potato chips don't have a shot.  I see what they're talking about.  That's right.  Yeah, you've got to incorporate gravity. 
[02:48:30]  I wonder why he didn't do that.  They say Albert Einstein was a genius.  And how come any time anyone calls you that, it's an insult, you know?  Oh, you don't know where you parked the car.  Good job, Einstein.  I don't think we're honoring him properly.  So I've been watching too much TV, man.  I've been watching, you know, these shows where people talk to dead people.  I mean, something's got to be said about that.  I mean, I don't like to step on people's beliefs, but, well, here we go. 
[02:49:00]  If you believe in it, that's fine.  But for me, they're always doing it in front of a group, which just shoots their odds right through the roof.  Did anyone here lose a friend or family member?  Or know someone who did?  You did in the mezzanine.  Yeah, I was getting a strong signal.  And this person passed on recently, 25 years ago.  That recently. 
[02:49:30]  Then I'm going to be extra sensitive.  I'm getting an M.  The letter M.  His name was Bo Ziffer.  Mr. Bo Ziffer.  And he died of natural causes, yes?  He was shot in the face by a bazooka, so naturally he'd be dead.  You guys are great.  Thank you very much.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before? 
[02:50:00]  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O.N.A. Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O.N.A. Party Rock!  The O.N.A. Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O.N.A. Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every party rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, 
[02:50:30]  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O.N.A. Party Rock is, is, is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone taking the face?  It's real, the pain you feel. 
[02:51:00]  You trust, you match, you're fast.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  And we're back.  Latest for the Foo Fighters right there.  The numbers are going up.  At least 45 dead, Anthony.  1,000 injuries with 150 serious.  Yeah.  That's from Sky News.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Boy.  Animals.  All right.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Oh, the ticker tape.  Right.  That would give me some indication I'm supposed to be reading it.  What am I supposed to be doing next, you know?  Going down on her?  Is that what we're doing next?  I'm not really sure what we're doing at this point.  I was hired to do the news. 
[02:52:00]  Yes.  What we have going on here is Paul Field and his lovely bride, Denise.  Not John.  At least not today.  And they're going to do the news for us, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  Want to hit the ticker tape?  You can after that.  I'm all completely flustered from that, so you have to bear with me now.  Yeah, right?  And now with the news, Paul.  We don't need to do the London one, because you pretty much talked about that already, right?  Well, someone might have just tuned in.  That's a top story.  Yeah, am I right or wrong?  Jesus.  He just throws the top story on the floor. 
[02:52:30]  Like the news isn't talking about it every two seconds.  Exactly.  So what do I need to do it?  They've done it 50 times.  You might as well.  You weren't around November of 63.  Well, I guess you guys heard there was a shooting in Dallas.  But on to the Cowboys school.  In other news, right?  Yeah, that would be an interesting thing to do one day.  What else happened on that day?  Because no one knows.  What was the news that day?  What was the other big story?  What was the second biggest story on November?  What comedian was booked on Sullivan for his first shot? 
[02:53:00]  Rich Voss.  Whose life got completely fucked?  Rich Voss.  November 22, 1963.  What was the number two story?  Number two story.  That's a very good question.  Yeah.  Look that up.  What?  You look that up on Yahoo, right?  Someone will.  Yeah, who has that?  Yeah, Eric is great at this.  He will in a second.  Eric, get to it right now.  All right, go ahead, Paul.  Okay, six blasts rocked London.  I don't know if this is out of date now, because obviously the numbers have changed.  But this is how the news read right after it came out. 
[02:53:30]  Half a dozen explosions rocked the London subway and tore open a packed double-decker bus  during the morning rash hour Thursday in London.  The blast killed at least two people and injured scores, which a shaken Prime Minister, Tony  Blair, said was an act of barbaric terrorism.  Blair made clear the attacks were designed to coincide with the opening of the G8 summit  in Scotland.  The Prime Minister said the meeting of world leaders would continue, but he would return  to London.  Bloodied and bandaged witnesses reporting panics, crowds fleeing the blast sites. 
[02:54:00]  A witness at the bus explosion said the entire top of the bus was destroyed.  He said, I was on the bus in front and heard an incredible bang.  I turned round and half the double-decker bus was in the air.  And then she started sucking my dick.  Fuck that story.  How long have we been?  Well, that sounded like real news, though, with his accent and stuff.  Yeah.  It almost sounded like a BBC report.  Yeah.  Should I stop and do it stupid now?  Is that how you want it?  How do you want?  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  That's what I'm feeling.  Okay.  Can your wife be topless for the news?  Ugh.  Ugh.  Hasn't everybody seen that now?  Everybody.  Everybody.  I think they want to see it again.  That's the point, right?  Everybody.  Okay.  Whatever.  I don't care.  I don't care.  There she goes.  Okay.  Oil prices, top $61 per barrel yesterday.  Fuck's sake.  No pictures.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy's like, woo!  What story are you doing?  Fuck.  Jimmy, the price per t-shirt just went up, motherfucker. 
[02:55:00]  Shipping's $19 each.  And you still make money.  Sell more stuff than Vostas.  Anyway.  Here we go.  The end date.  Okay.  Yeah.  So yesterday, yesterday, oil prices passed $61 a barrel due to the fact that they were  worried about production with Tropical Storm Cindy.  In other news, Citadel stock closed at $11.79.  Fuck you.  We got in at $19. 
[02:55:30]  We shut up.  But you only have like 10 shares, so it's not a problem.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Stock's going down faster than your wife.  Put them away now.  They're done.  They've had their fucking time.  Put them away.  Time's up.  News is over.  All right.  She's covering up.  Relax.  No, no, no.  We'll do halfway.  How about it?  I like that.  Like a Tarzan thing for one tip.  That's cute.  Wow, you stink at doing the news.  No, I have a story that I think something just happened on and it's out of date. 
[02:56:00]  So, anyway.  Is that how it's there, Eric?  What, the number?  No, it's today.  No, I know that.  But they just said someone got killed.  Okay, I didn't know if this was...  Go ahead.  Okay.  Taliban friends to kill U.S. commando.  A purported Taliban spokesman reiterated a claim firstly that his group is holding a  missing U.S. Navy SEAL and said insurgent leaders had decided to kill him.  He offered no proof to back up the claim.  U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant Cindy Moore, reacting to the claim, says, 
[02:56:30]  We hope he's not in harm's way.  We are making every effort to locate him.  The purported spokesman, Mala Lekif Hayemi, said previously that the Taliban are holding  the commando who has been missing in Afghanistan for 10 days.  Hakimi frequently contacts news agency to speak on behalf of the Remils, but in the past  his information has proven to be exaggerated or completely untrue.  The death you're talking about was not that one.  No.  I wasn't.  I just saw it in a quarter of my eye.  All right.  The next story by...  Denise.  Denise, who's half topless.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[02:57:00]  This is about Lil' Kim.  It said,  A Grammy-winning rapper, Lil' Kim, was sentenced Wednesday to a year and a half in prison and  fined $50,000 for lying to a federal grand jury to protect friends involved in a 2001 shootout  outside a Manhattan radio station.  It says,  While many rappers have served time in prison, Lil' Kim is the first big-name female to do so.  The rapper told the grand jury that she did not notice two of her friends at the scene of the shootout. 
[02:57:30]  Her manager, Damian Butler and Salt Jackson, known as Gutta, both have pleaded guilty to gun charges.  Gutta.  Gutta.  Gutta. 
[02:58:00]  Griega.  Lil' Kim's group confronted the others about the...  Oh, my God.  You're going to do it all day?  Yeah, really.  The bang-bang song, okay, that contained an insult to Lil' Kim.  And it just said one man was hurt in the shootout. 
[02:58:30]  Okay, here's one for Jimmy.  So, next time he goes on vacation, this will be pretty relevant.  City may end speed limits in high crime areas.  Rio de Janeiro legislators voted to end enforcement of speed limits in part of Crime Plague City at night to cut down on attacks on slow-moving cars.  There you go.  Which is pretty much Jimmy.  The city's legislative assembly passed a bell on 30 to turn off the cameras to enforce the 40 miles per hour...  Sorry, 40 kilometers an hour, which is 25 miles per hour, in accident-prone part of Seaside City.  Many drivers already ignored the signals late at night for fear of being robbed. 
[02:59:00]  That city is one of the world's highest murder rates.  Earlier this month, the legislative assembly also decided to put walls along the edge of the highways to avoid people getting hit with some shootouts between drug gangs.  But then, uh, they said that that was, uh, racist and they threw it out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I do that, uh, uptown or, uh, in Brooklyn, some parts of Brooklyn.  You just don't stop the lights, no speed limit, nothing.  Cabbies go right through them.  We were in Rio, and they go right through the red lights. 
[02:59:30]  Throw down, make sure there's nothing coming, and go.  That's it.  Why would you stop?  Well, the Midtown Tunnel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's gonna get you in there?  Yeah.  That one robs you in the tunnel.  I don't think anyone's ever...  Oh, you mean outside the tunnel?  Yeah.  In the morning when you're taking that little nasty U-turn or whatever.  Are there even tunnel bunnies anymore?  Remember them?  Are they like jungle bunnies?  Hookers.  Oh, my God.  Hookers that used to hang out outside the tunnel.  And then they'd get in your car, and they'd give you a blowjob in the tunnel. 
[03:00:00]  Drive me in.  And then you'd let them out on the other side.  And then they would get a ride back the other way, doing the same thing.  Chappy, Jimmy's on MapQuest right now, looking for those directions.  No, what are they gonna do outside the Lincoln Tunnel?  There's nowhere to do it.  I guess this was back when there was a place.  Probably in the car.  Why are you driving?  There didn't used to be, like, you know, 20,000 cops and armed security outside of the tunnels.  It used to just be nothing.  So, yeah.  Girl jump in, I guess. 
[03:00:30]  She jump in.  She suck your dick through the tunnel.  And then she gets out.  The cop goes to the other side and waits for somebody going the other way.  Let's be a pray for no traffic.  If you're born alone, you don't want to sit with her for 20 minutes.  You must drive pretty slowly, too, right?  How are you doing?  Come through there in three minutes?  Yeah.  How about this traffic?  Yeah.  So, where are you from?  Scratching her arms.  All right.  Let's go.  This new segment is lagging.  We might have to go back to the sex stories.  Yeah, I think so. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Well, President Bush collided with a local police officer yesterday when he fell during a bike ride  on the grounds of the Glen Eagles Golf Resort while attending a meeting of world leaders.  That's good enough.  Throw that away.  Don't need that no more.  Throw that away.  Anyway, he just suffered mild to moderate scrapes on his hands, and he was more concerned  about the officer that he ran into.  Okay.  Suspects held a new Pakistan rape case.  Police arrested seven men who allegedly kidnapped and gang raped a married woman in retaliation 
[03:01:30]  for her cousin's affair with one of the suspect's daughters.  What a deal.  Wow.  Yeah.  One suspect was angered over a relationship between his 17-year-old daughter and the victim's  20-year-old cousin.  So, him and his friends got together and fucked their mom.  Okay.  I hear she blew the whole thing, though, by actually accepting it and just going through  with it.  It's not rape, it's okay.  It ruined it for them because they wanted to rape her, and she just, you know, agreed  with it.  Yeah.  Where am I going? 
[03:02:00]  It was fun just watching you meander down the dead end.  Out of my peripheral vision, I just see Jimmy's teeth, so I know he's smiling.  Yeah, I'm just bummed out of here.  How much longer are I going to keep this fucking...  Scotty, what's up?  One wheel left on that car.  Scotty, go ahead.  Hey, how about a little bit of bed music, a little bit of porn music in lieu of the teletype  for the young lady there reading the news?  Yeah, not a bad idea, actually.  We should have porn music instead of the regular... 
[03:02:30]  That's going to go well with this story.  Oh, yeah?  All right, one more.  Well, I've got tons more.  You want a sexy one?  No, there's one more.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  Okay, hold on.  I've got one.  Hold on.  Give us your best story because this is like...  Give us the Britney Spears one.  This is really dying.  Well, you can have the Britney Spears one.  Okay.  And then, but before that, I want...  Britney's celebrity news.  Yeah, celebrity news.  You do that.  Since I'm well-known for doing celebrities.  Oh.  All right.  Well, they're saying that Britney Spears is pregnant with twins. 
[03:03:00]  And that her husband has been spending just a bit too much money lately.  He says he spends money like water.  He has no job to speak of.  I spend money like water.  You spend water?  Yeah.  Spends money like water.  Hmm.  Like it's water.  What are you...  And has no job...  They say that she's keeping Kevin on a leash and that she's beginning to think and start  waking up that, I don't know, I would say that he's basically sponging off of her. 
[03:03:30]  No job, no, yeah, no job, no.  Not really.  Let's compare their incomes.  Okay.  Here's one for Jimmy.  Women stripping in forests to foil police.  Women in eastern India are stripping naked to distract police to help criminal gangs who  are illegally chopping down trees.  You'd think really that the smell would put the cops off, but anyway.  Fucking Indians.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Okay.  Be nice.  Be nice.  You need to fart.  Uh, two more. 
[03:04:00]  Real slips.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Alcohol has been banned in two small Australian Aboriginal communities to stop young people  from a nearby alcohol-free township from risking their lives by swimming across a crocodile-infested  river to get a drink.  In the recent past, young people have been known to swim across the Moe River from a restricted  area in order to drink.  That's really it.  Okay.  Last one.  Police in Germany thought they had an open and shut case of drunk driving when they found  a dazed and confused owner of a wrecked car who was badly hung over.  But, in fact, a 54-year-old man was a victim of a car theft. 
[03:04:30]  He was actually sleeping in the trunk when somebody else stole the car and then crashed  it.  And, uh, here's the last one.  I thought that was the last one.  No, she stole one more.  Oh, this is pretty neat.  Okay.  Oh, it sucks.  Yeah, really.  It takes a strong stomach to eat curry or chocolate ice cream out of a toilet bowl.  Evidently, in Taiwan, there's a new restaurant out in which they serve their food out of a  commode.  And that's it, really. 
[03:05:00]  What's the name?  What's it called?  The rock and roll deli?  Which ain't connection!  Oh, it's good time.  It says the food arrives in bowls shaped like Western-style toilets.  Or, as they would call, squat pots.  Squat pots.  Just don't order the stew.  That's pretty much it.  That's blue.  Oh, you want to do the gay marriage story, Paul?  You can end with that.  Okay.  Spain's gay marriage story.  I mean, I actually got a really interesting news story.  It's one of our bits coming to life.  Yes. 
[03:05:30]  Okay.  Spain's gay...  It's the story of the day.  Well, that was trumped by, obviously, what's going on overseas.  But this is one of those goofy stories of the day.  Go ahead, Paul Field.  Okay, Spain's new gay marriage law hits its first slag Wednesday when a Spanish man says  he can't marry his Indian partner because India does not allow same-sex marriage.  The dispute erupted Tuesday six days after Spain's parliament made his country the third  in the war to legalized gay marriage.  The others are Netherlands and Belgium.  I bet France can't wait.  Faggots.  That's it. 
[03:06:00]  I'm fucking done.  Fuck all of you.  Yeah, you're definitely done.  Yeah, I know.  Took the sex out of the show.  I apologize.  Those stories were fascinating.  They stunk.  Stunk, they did.  You know what it was?  If it wasn't for all that other stuff before, they would have been okay.  Well, you know what it was?  The regular news couldn't follow the real-life escapades.  Yeah, the trauma-escapades.  The real-life news you guys got.  No, I got a really good story, actually, and it's one of our bits come to life.  A goofy bit that Anthony and I did, I don't know, maybe seven years ago. 
[03:06:30]  Whenever the, who was it, Packers?  The Green Bay Packers and the New England Patriots were in the Super Bowl.  We were in the Super Bowl, yeah.  So we made some prank calls to Wisconsin there.  Had some fun with one of these things we did.  And now there's a story in the paper which is very similar to this bit we did, which was a complete goof, obviously.  Yep.  You want to read this one, Anthony?  Sure.  All right.  Pittsburgh.  Opie, this is from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
[03:07:00]  Of course it is.  James Henry Smith was a zealous Pittsburgh Steelers fan in life, and even death couldn't keep him from his favorite spot.  In a recliner in front of the TV, showing his beloved team in action.  That's right.  Smith, 55, of Pittsburgh, died of prostate cancer Thursday, but his death wasn't unexpected.  His family was able to plan for an unusual viewing Tuesday.  The Samuel E. Costin Funeral Home erected a small stage in the viewing room and arranged furniture on it, much as it was in Smith's home on game day Sundays. 
[03:07:30]  Smith's body was on a recliner.  His feet crossed, remote in his hand.  He wore black and gold silk pajamas, slippers, and a robe.  A pack of cigarettes and beer were at his side, while a high-definition TV played a continuous loop of Steelers highlights.  I couldn't stop crying after looking at the Steelers' blanket in his lap, said his sister, Marianne Nails, 58. 
[03:08:00]  He loved football, and no one did anything until the game went off.  It was just like he was at home.  Long-time friend said the viewing was a celebration.  I saw it and couldn't even cry, she said.  People will see him the way he was.  Smith's burial plans were more traditional.  He'll be laid to rest in a casket.  Mom and Dad, I hope you're listening.  If I was to die, I'd hope to be propped up with a black, questionable gender creature with blonde hair bobbing up, calling me Dead Dick Daddy. 
[03:08:30]  Dead Dick Daddy.  I think your parents would do anything for you after what you said you're doing with him?  What?  Bury him in the garden, don't you remember?  Bury him out back.  Yeah.  Wow, that is a diehard Steelers' blanket.  I think it's a Pittsburgh Toast fucking skill note, idiots.  Kind of similar to a little prank call we did that's featured on our Demented World CD.  Yeah, we were just goofing around, and this guy took it seriously.  So why don't we go to that tape right now? 
[03:09:00]  Hello?  Yes, may I help you?  Okay, my name's Artie Milo, and my father recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes, yes he did.  When was that?  I don't know, two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family, and we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, temporarily prop him up in the big chair,  so when the family comes over he'll be okay until after the Super Bowl, and then we'll bury him? 
[03:09:30]  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl, and we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would be, you mean not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do and, you know, preserve him until after the bowl.  No, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl. 
[03:10:00]  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping, and I don't think he's going to make it until Sunday.  No, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully no one.  But we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and maybe open up his hand so we could put a beer in there.  No, we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home.  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position.  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard. 
[03:10:30]  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later?  No, I'm afraid we can't.  We'd even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  Do you see the pack in the bowl with his family, and we've got the big screen TV and the chair for him, and he went up and died?  We will not do that.  If your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to do that.  So you have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away. 
[03:11:00]  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin?  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able, you know, like if there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right.  And could you put like a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack, well, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house, depending on how, you know, how well he preserved he was, 
[03:11:30]  and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down.  Right.  Okay, do you think that's, like, degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  I really like that one a lot.  Ah, very good.  Pack in the bowl.  Mm-hmm.  Go pack, go.  You guys didn't have the Mariah Carey story. 
[03:12:00]  Mariah's sister?  What was that in?  Huh?  Which paper?  Ah, a little paper called the New York Post.  Yes.  It's a big story.  Celebrity news.  It wasn't on the website at 4 a.m. when I left my house.  Mariah's sister in hooker arrest.  God, I like that.  Why?  It's just dirty.  Mariah Carey's troubled HIV-positive sister.  Uh-oh.  It just got hotter.  Jimenoza has been arrested for prostitution for a second time.  Suffolk County Police said they picked up Allison Carey, 43, after she solicited an undercover 
[03:12:30]  cop at the West Shore Marina in Huntington, Long Island on June 13th.  Hey, Huntington.  Where's the West Shore Marina?  It's right there by the water.  Yeah.  It's in Long Island.  She offered to engage in sexual conduct for $250 in cash.  The nerve of this bitch, by the way, with AIDS, to still want $250.  $250, and she's got AIDS.  You've got to mark that down a little bit, huh?  Is she using the Mariah Carey angle?  Ah, there's a whole thing going on. 
[03:13:00]  Shit, I could have been rich.  How much is a sister?  What does she look like?  Let me see her picture.  She looks like the Mariah Carey if she was retarded.  Yeah, definitely.  That's what happens with celebrity siblings.  They look like the celebrity if that celebrity was retarded.  It's called the Patrick Swayze syndrome.  That's right.  You ever see Patrick Swayze's brother?  Looks like Patrick Swayze with Down syndrome.  And the Stallones as well, right?  Yeah, Frank Stallone.  Stallone's Tom Hanks.  Except Sylvester's the dumb-looking one. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, true.  She looks like Mariah Dennis.  That's what her name should be.  Pulling little pins out of her map.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Pat and his big hog don't want to go to Europe because he can't get her passport.  Isn't Nicole Kidman's sister hotter than her?  Did you see Nicole Kidman's sister?  Really?  She's in Australia.  Oh, really?  All right.  It was Allison's second prostitution arrest.  She was previously busted in April at her Huntington home, police said.  She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in that one and was fined $200 on June 2nd.  Eleven days later, she was back on the streets, police said. 
[03:14:00]  The new charge carries a maximum of three months in jail.  Allison Carey has been out of tune with her family for years.  She has claimed in interviews that she started turning tricks as a teenager and that her work  paid for limos that took her younger sister to her early gigs.  Ah, so she's blaming it on Mariah.  In the early 1990s, Allison was so broke and strung out that her mother got custody of the young woman's son.  She gave birth to another boy and spent years in welfare motels and sleeping in a car. 
[03:14:30]  But she later lost custody of that boy as well.  In 2000, she shopped a tell-all book about her life and her famous sister, whom she called a vain and heartless multimillionaire.  The book was never published, if it was written at all.  Mariah's probably over to hell, but this dumb bitch won't stop smoking dope.  Stop!  Die already.  You guys missed it.  She made $50 profit on that.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, $250.  She got fined $200.  She's anticipating the fine.  Yeah.  Oh, is it too... 
[03:15:00]  How much is it if she hasn't got AIDS?  Is it less?  For the fine?  Jimmy, what did you pay?  E-L.  Yeah, anyway.  E-L.  Yes.  Is that your name?  My name is E-L.  E-L.  E-L.  E-L.  E-L.  Yeah.  A nice Hebrew name.  E-L?  E-L.  We were here at 845 this morning in London.  E-L.  What's up?  E-L.  You are the inventor of boy butter.  Right.  Boy butter. 
[03:15:30]  We had some of this stuff in here.  Who brought that in, Opie?  Do you remember?  No.  I don't either.  I think it was one of my friends from Deluxe Distributors.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I can't remember who it was.  I'm not sure, but I was a little...  I saw it.  It looks like butter that you would buy in some kind of...  In a supermarket.  It just looks like a big thing of butter.  Something that's come from a large butter distributor.  Right.  And when you look at it, it says boy butter on it, and the logo is a man's hand wrapped 
[03:16:00]  around a butter churn handle.  And we asked what this was all about, and we were told it was a lubricant that is used  mostly in the gay community.  Yeah.  Well, I launched it in the gay community about three years ago.  And it could be used anywhere, but what it is, it's a blend of vegetable oils and an organic 
[03:16:30]  silicone that's used in hair products, hair gel, stuff like that.  So the stuff lasts and lasts and lasts.  It never dries out.  You don't want it drying out, especially the gay guys.  Believe me, gay men use much more lube.  I mean, they get laid much, much more than straight guys.  So lube is important, you know?  Certainly is.  And by they, are you saying that you are not a gay guy?  I am absolutely a gay guy.  Oh, you are a gay guy.  Yeah, but I have to speak for, you know, I have to speak for them. 
[03:17:00]  Jay, hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jay Moore just woke up in L.A., Jay.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're talking to the inventor of boy butter.  Oh, God.  That must be like the Holland Tunnel for that guy.  It's a lube.  I know what it is.  I use it all the time on my shelf.  You do?  I think, well, this guy, he's a gay gentleman, and he invented this product for the gay community.  It's called boy butter. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, what was wrong with the regular lubricants that were around that made you say, hmm, I've  got to come up with something better because this just isn't working?  Just like anything, like sometimes things just dried out.  And then you want it, or sometimes things would never, ever dry out.  Yeah.  And you couldn't get them off with, like, industrial solvent.  Yeah, let's be honest.  You wanted to make fisting that much easier, right?  If it dries out, you get the pink sock. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, you ever pull out of someone's ass, and the skin comes with a little bit, the pink  sock?  Oh, Jimmy.  As opposed to good?  I've been listening.  Every time you say that, you go, damn it, Jay.  Because it's so goddamn funny.  It's all I think of.  It's a couple beautiful girls.  We do that impression all the time.  Yeah, so, I mean, what else can you tell us about the boy butter? 
[03:18:30]  Well, listen, listen, I watch it in the gay community.  It's not a loop just for gay people.  Actually, almost a third of my clients are just women, and I sell to, like, almost all  women's stores.  Yeah, because guys aren't buying boy butter.  They've got more places to put it, if you know what I mean.  No.  No, no.  Not at all.  Yeah, what do you mean?  I don't know at all what you mean.  Yeah, you know what?  Listen, every time a lady gets this stuff from me, I always tell her, listen, you can put 
[03:19:00]  it anywhere.  You can put it.  It's perfect for all your lips.  So...  How old is it?  Wouldn't it get all over the teeth?  What?  Well, you're confusing me, sir.  They guys always do this to me.  They get talking, and then they talk in circles.  Next thing you know, I'm taking one in the shitter.  You're not going to fuck me hard, are you?  As opposed to slow?  Now, now, E.L. 
[03:19:30]  I get raped every day.  Now, because this one, with a penguin suit, the church puts up a reward.  It's a record.  Why did you invent the lubricant just for the gay community?  Don't you think that heterosexuals like to stick things in their ass, too?  I don't think that's exactly why.  I didn't do it for the gay community.  I launched it within the gay community, because since gay people have more sex, it would spread.  What?  It would spread, pun intended, it would spread within the gay community much faster. 
[03:20:00]  I don't think it would use it with gay people and spread.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, after that, gay people started using it, because once gay people started using it,  it would spread much faster to them, because it's a smaller community.  And then it would spread like, well, you guys are talking about it now, so it obviously, you know, made the leap.  We're still talking about boy butter?  Yeah.  It's a new commercial.  Boy butter, robe not included.  I want to know what the development process of this was. 
[03:20:30]  What did you try before butter?  Yeah, exactly.  I was using olive oil.  Olive oil?  Yeah, I'm just, I'm crazy about the kitchen.  What were some of the names before you finally hit on boy butter?  I didn't, you know, I never thought about, I never thought about making a lube until I came up with the name boy butter,  and that's just a euphemism for cum.  So, I thought, what would be, you know?  I thought, it's like baby battle, you know?  Right.  It's just, it's just a pun for cum, so I thought that'd be a great, it's something that could sneak under the radar and it would pop up. 
[03:21:00]  We got this shit in, like, Save On or, you know, like Rite Aid in here in LA.  So, the funny thing is, you've got this thing that means cum and it's being folded like drugstores.  Boy butter, right.  Don't you think it's unfair, so, that gay guys get to go to the gym and use the same locker room as the people they want to fuck?  I believe it's totally fair.  And I bet you're a muscle-bound asshole.  I am, I'm huge, I'm gorgeous, and I'm fucking hot. 
[03:21:30]  Alright, take it easy.  You know, you're going to the gym and you're just going to the women's locker room and you've done bench press and then some girl's shaving her pussy and you're like, oh, hi, hi, I'm about to go do chest.  You're like, oh, so am I, what a coincidence.  Yeah, just sitting in the locker room.  Yeah, because you don't work out for your health.  You work out so you look good while you're fucking.  You know, let's be honest.  You catch yourself in the closet mirror and you're like, oh, I can totally do porn.  This looks great. 
[03:22:00]  And then, you know, you just, you know, all that degenerate into Colin.  Again, Jim, Jim, shut up.  You're like that magnanimous.  Colin.  Colin starred in the show today, so.  Very good.  Well, what else?  Who's the girl in there?  Denise, it's, uh, Denise, she's got 36 double D's and she likes, uh, giving head to black guys.  And celebrities.  In bathrooms.  Hey, hey, hey.  Ew.  All right, are we going to let.  Black was a one-time thing. 
[03:22:30]  Well, are we going to let y'all go?  I want to know if he's working on anything else.  Any other new inventions, uh, you're coming up with?  Well, listen, I'm coming out with a, uh, a four and eight ounce size.  Girl butter.  It's going to be all over New York soon.  What's that, y'all?  I'm coming out with a four and eight ounce size and there's going to be a squeezable, like a French's mustard squeezable.  That's going to be coming out for Hanukkah.  Oh, my God.  For Hanukkah.  He's back, isn't he?  Jesus.  And then, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.  Next year, we're going to come out with a water base called You Won't Believe It's Not Boy Butter. 
[03:23:00]  So, you guys got to.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What do you call it if the date's over 15?  Coming down the pike.  I just want to, I also want to give a shout out to my friend Scott Kaplan here in L.A.  who just got a new job.  Congratulations.  What kind of job did he get?  He's a, he's a, he's a, he's like a talent agent out here in Hollywood.  A talent scout?  Yeah, an agent for like people in TV and stuff.  Is his name Coughlin?  It's Scott Kaplan.  Oh, Kaplan.  I thought he said Coughlin. 
[03:23:30]  Not from the famous Kaplan brothers.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I'm serious.  We know the Kaplan brothers.  Well, maybe you can hook them up.  They did the Silence of the Lambs, the musical there.  All right, all right.  All right, E.L., we got to let you and your boy butter go, I guess.  Yeah, I took you a listen to anybody watching the information.  There's a trainee in the background.  It's over there in the yellow box.  Thank you.  All right, thank you, E.L.  Bye, E.L.  Ciao, bye.  There you go.  Wait, what's going on, Jay?  I was talking to my boy.  Oh, I thought I was yelling at him.  Jay talking to his kid.  Jay.  Oh, I thought. 
[03:24:00]  I'm talking, I'm talking to my son about boy butter.  Hey, Jay.  Yes, sir.  I was watching IFC the other night.  Independent Film Channel.  And I checked out, what was that, Dinner for Five?  Yeah.  And you were on there?  Yeah.  That was some very, very funny shit, man.  You know what?  They kept talking about Deadwood, and I had never seen an episode of Deadwood, and they  just dominated the table with Deadwood talk.  You know something, though?  That really didn't make the cut as much as, because I watched it, and there was some 
[03:24:30]  Deadwood talk, but some of the funniest shit was just you guys beating the crap out of  each other.  Rappaport and, what's his name?  I must see.  Oliphant.  Yeah, Deadwood.  Holy shit.  Rappaport was completely baked, so it was mine.  Thank you.  He was out of his mind.  Oh, Michael?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was really stoned for the whole show.  I'm like, wow, look at you, dude.  You're freaking out.  He was, they all, like, they're drinking.  Mm-hmm.  They're hanging out.  The mood is super good on that show.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, they're all, they're, they're talking, and then you see Jay just shoved his big fork 
[03:25:00]  full of shit in his face.  But it's very funny.  It's just a bunch of these guys just sitting around talking about their movies and other  actors and shit, and just, like, ragging each other.  Very funny show.  I like that.  Thank you, Anthony.  I like the pictures of you as the lead singer of Queen on the Photoshop forum.  I'm a big fan of it.  Oh, great.  It turned into just a giant page of racist photos.  Exactly.  It's like a bunch of fucking pests. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, it was, I mean, they might as well just wear a hood.  Yeah, we're-  Just pictures of black people.  I mean, Pat, what's the best, what's the real deal with Pat Battle?  Why, why, how has she become such a celebrity?  There is absolutely no reason for it.  You know how some sensations just take off with, for no reason?  Pat Battle is one of those.  It's just something about her and her name.  Yes.  The whole name, Pat Battle.  It's just a, it's a great name.  Who's more of a, who's more of a, who's on top, Pat Battle or Sue Simmons? 
[03:26:00]  Pat Battle.  I don't know, Sue Simmons is pretty on top.  Nah, she's a, she's a raceless idiot.  We don't know what she is.  She's a conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel newscaster.  But Pat Battle.  I'm going to go up, because Jim, oh, go ahead, Jim.  No, it's okay, Pat, I said Pat Battle, we're just obsessed with her.  I'm obsessed with her, I don't know why.  I hate it.  Why?  I hate the Pat Battle thing. 
[03:26:30]  I don't know, Pat Battle, I don't know what she does.  Well, you don't want to see her.  Hey, where did your wife go there, Paul?  I guess she had another line in the bathroom.  Fuck.  Oh, God.  I don't really, we just wrote a note.  Have to pee, wink.  Jay, we got a great hour out of this husband and wife team, Paul and Denise, in the studio today.  Hey, what's up, Jay?  All right, Paul.  She's blowing black eyes with him there?  She blew a black soap star in England.  British soap star.  Get back on primetime.  That kind of looks like Will Smith and the guy had a ten-incher. 
[03:27:00]  Just went into the bathroom, he walked in after, kind of pinned her against the wall,  and she kneeled down and just hobbed it.  So, why is it Paul to smack her around?  I don't know.  I actually learned a few tricks from it, I guess.  He was waiting downstairs, uh...  With my kid.  Fuck.  With his kid.  With the kid waiting for her to come back.  You gotta grab her by the throat and say, bitch, don't you ever disrespect me?  I feel no better than ever.  What's wrong with you?  I don't ever call her a bitch.  I call her a cunt.  It happened in a... 
[03:27:30]  What are you?  You let your wife do that?  It happened in a bathroom stall while he was downstairs waiting for her.  I have to tell you.  Well, I think a black guy, you're gonna get ahead.  Of course, that's what happened.  A big fucking spear coming towards our chin.  Yeah, now he's, like, trying to be one of us.  Like, and meanwhile, he's, you know, he's beaten off to his wife being a slave to black cock.  I've seen the website.  Well, we used to own a few.  You know what, Paul?  She was getting nigged.  Yeah, really? 
[03:28:00]  That's horrible.  You would knock the fuck out.  All right, boy, why don't you say cypress?  I actually, I called Billy Mac because I had to make fun of him about the, uh, his gay boat.  His gay boat.  I, and that was fun.  I had a great time on there.  Uh, it wasn't one of the gay cruises.  I'll have to go next time on one of those gay cruises.  And then, uh, I'm up early with the boy and I got the girlfriend.  We're making a little breakfast.  Ah, very nice.  Hanging out.  Very, very nice.  She goes back to work in a week.  I don't know what I'm going to do. 
[03:28:30]  Ice sculpture is shaped like a cock in the middle of the food.  What?  What?  I don't know what the limey's saying.  Yeah, I was saying.  You fucked it all up, though.  Yeah, I know.  Really.  Where's my car crash?  Get me out of this now.  Yeah, that doesn't even deserve a crash.  Who's that?  All from Munaki?  Yeah, really.  No, I was saying there should be a huge penis ice sculpture in the middle of the food if it was a gay cruise.  Remember, at a boat trip?  Oh, he said it again.  Oh, my God.  I give up.  Double-decker bus you should have been on.  Yeah, yeah, really.  Yeah.  Some tow hitter pulls himself up on it. 
[03:29:00]  He does stuff for Jim Norton.  He's my merchandise guy.  He ships all my merchandise.  Him and his wife ship my shirts and my CDs and stuff.  He actually did a great hour of radio, and he's been awful ever since.  But he told a story about banging some cripple.  The girl was paralyzed from the waist down.  That was a good story.  And then the wife came back with the big story how she sucked black cock in the bathroom while he was downstairs.  It was an hour of great entertainment.  But then he trumped her because the second time he had sex with the cripple, she shit the bed and he had to wait in the hotel bathroom. 
[03:29:30]  I can't stop that one.  While old fucking dumpster legs had to have the fucking maid come in and clean up, change the sheets while he lurked in the restroom.  You think it would have been better if she was disabled on the top half?  I mean, the bottom half?  And then Denise's mom taught her how to give a good blowjob when she was a kid.  So we got some good stuff out of them.  How old is your kid?  I have three.  Yeah.  You have three kids?  I have three.  She's not teaching the BJs. 
[03:30:00]  No.  Denise's mom taught Denise the BJ thing.  All right.  So it was a lot of, it was good stuff.  And then another guy took her in another bathroom on another occasion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe she should tell the story of how she was a stripper for a couple of days, but she says it was a dance club.  But you don't go up on a stage with a fucking pulp.  No, no.  It was a dance.  I swear to God, I was 18.  I lived in Florida.  You notice every story that she tells, she gets younger and younger.  Yeah, I know, really.  The first one I was like 25. 
[03:30:30]  I was 12 when I met Jim Norton.  21, then 19.  No, no, no.  And now you're 18 stripping.  I didn't suck, fuck, or do anything at 18 with anyone.  So what's new?  When did you lose your virginity?  17.  17.  And it was a bad story that we're not getting into, huh?  And when did you first give a BJ?  Uh, maybe 16.  16.  That's funny, because you said your mama taught you at 17, you liar.  No, I'm 16.  Hey, I didn't say I knew how to do it then, but I attempted.  Yeah, I said 16, she didn't. 
[03:31:00]  Does that guy have a British accent?  Yes, she does.  Yes, Mr. Moore.  Yes, Mr. Moore.  He was having phone sex with Denise, and then they decided to hook up and get married and stuff, I guess.  Oh, British phone sex.  You could feel their bad breath for the phone line.  Hello.  She says that Paul's bag smells really bad, so.  What's the hell?  Not to date, though, apparently.  It smells like what?  It smells like shepherd's pie and a cadaver. 
[03:31:30]  And that he has bad-tasting spunk.  Yeah.  Yeah, if anybody else can tell...  And this is your husband?  Yeah.  You got it made, honey.  As opposed to black guys.  As opposed to what?  Hey, it's not the size of the tool, right?  It's how you use it.  Thanks a lot.  I just said something.  You look at some rolls of black tar paper in bathrooms and your husband's bag smells like  shepherd's pioneers.  Come on.  She's really burying you, man.  Let's talk about that Nikki Cox. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  She's a lovely girl.  That's right.  She's lovely.  Yeah.  Denise, is he hung?  Is he hung?  Yeah.  Paul?  He's uncircumcised.  That's true.  Unclipped, as we say.  Unclipped.  Unclipped.  You flaggedy Americans say to him...  His parents are poor and they didn't want to spend the 40 pounds to continue it.  So what do you think?  Is he hung or what?  I'll plead the fifth.  Just to think about it.  Plead the fifth.  That's not good.  Tell the truth.  Yeah, tell the truth.  Yeah, it's okay.  Six inches is average, right? 
[03:32:30]  Let's just clear that one up first.  We're above average.  Well, then he's five.  What?  Come on, I want to go.  Come on, let's get the tape measure out.  You know what it is?  After 12-inch black fucking big piece of meat in your face, anything looks small.  Wait, you don't think he's above seven?  No, I don't.  I think he's about five.  You're a fucking idiot.  I'm above seven.  I do.  All right.  Don't get these dicks to get the tape measure out.  You're seven and she says you're five.  Well, I said after fucking 12 feet of spear in her fucking chin. 
[03:33:00]  You know, you're looking at the Tower of Inferno and then there's a white guy going,  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just pay your bills and I'll suck it, bitch.  But how wide is it?  Do you have a girth?  Oh, she was talking about Wi-Fi.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, so that's the update, Jay.  These two are a class act.  So what about you, Jay?  What are you telling us?  Jay has told many stories.  I just want to tell you guys, I listen every day.  I listen to the replay.  And I don't know if you've ever noticed that when you listen to the replay, no matter when 
[03:33:30]  you get in your car, it's the same 15 minutes.  Isn't that weird?  We have talked about that.  I had to listen to you talking about Jethro Tull fucking eight times yesterday.  Dude, we don't even remember doing that break.  We were so tired yesterday.  That's so weird that our buddy Jay is just listening to us in L.A. like it's nothing.  Always.  And then Billy Mack called and I said, I've got to get the whole band done together.  Right on.  Yeah.  When are you coming back out to New York?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I'll be here through the summer.  I'm just relaxing.  Jay, let me tell you something. 
[03:34:00]  Let me get serious.  Let me get serious for a minute.  I want to thank you for never forgetting about us.  Other people have kind of forgotten us as we try to get our radio careers back together  here.  You're my friends.  The latest is Dice.  Dice has decided he doesn't need to come on our show this week.  He's playing Caroline.  Playing Caroline.  We always have Caroline bring the comics over here.  And Dice, I thought, was more of a friend of the show where even if his show was sold  out, he would still come in, drop by, and say hi. 
[03:34:30]  But apparently he has said no.  He does not wish to come here.  And he said the reason is that the tickets will sell themselves.  Yeah.  You know, when I was on the show the first time with you guys, it had been a long time.  And I went on those message boards that I always look at because I love them and they  make me laugh.  Yeah.  Congratulations to everybody that posts in the Photoshop.  By the way, the guy that does Hulk Hogan, you can't see me, brother.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Hey, what is that one?  Huh?  What is that one?  It's just this photo, like, when you post and you have, like, one guy who's got Bunny 
[03:35:00]  from Platoon.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a fake pic.  Like, they all have their own little fake pics.  One guy who's Jimmy and Dice are skaters.  Yeah.  One guy who's got Hulk Hogan with his hand in front of his face and he tagged it himself.  You can't see me, brother.  It was a photo of Shatner and Voss of Star Trek.  Star Trek.  An adult.  Oh, that's a funny one.  I laughed at that Hulk Hogan photo like I was stumped. 
[03:35:30]  You can't see me, brother.  Like, I called people into the room to look at it.  You can't see me, brother.  Have you seen it?  No, now I've got to look for it.  It's so funny, dude.  If you just leave it there, it gets funnier.  So it's kind of a bummer.  Dice has decided that he doesn't need us, which is whatever, but I thought, you know,  we're all friends, you know?  Well, you learn that you're not.  So, it was a bummer to hear that. 
[03:36:00]  He said that he doesn't need us to sell the tickets.  Well, I was bummed out.  I'm sorry.  I took the long way to my point.  I had to give out props to the past.  But when I came on, I was reading those boards, and they're like, man, it was funny, but  I'm going to have to listen for another year or two before I judge whether or not Jay's  back with the show for real.  They're just saying he had to call when he was doing shows, which I wasn't.  They're okay.  I had nothing to promote when I came on.  And then Brewer, you guys talk about him getting a show on that Doggy Network. 
[03:36:30]  And then he hasn't been on.  And on the message board, you're like, hey, you guys are going to see the family.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  I'm like, why does Brewer get a free pass?  Well, Brewer calls me stoned a lot and says, hey, man, I can still do your show.  And I'm like, all right, then come on on Monday, you know?  And then it never happened, so.  Does the show start yet?  I guess.  I guess.  He called me a lot about that for advice, and I told him it was a horrendous move, and  he just wouldn't listen. 
[03:37:00]  I said, we'll throw you on our channel, and you can ride with us a little bit and get  your sea legs, and he decided against that.  It's too bad.  Well, at the time, you know, everything comes out in the wash.  You know who your friends are, and I'll always call you guys because you're my friends.  And the reality is, you never came in here just to promote.  I came in because it was the most fun I ever had in my life.  Yeah, the faithful listeners know that. 
[03:37:30]  I mean, you know, there was times we all did business together, but the reality was  you would come on no matter what.  I got the sigpix now.  You can't see me, brother.  That is really funny.  Holding his hand in front of his face.  I haven't seen no one yet.  Very good.  All right.  Far track.  All right, guys.  Have a rest.  Hey, we'll see you in L.A.  We're coming to L.A. in early August.  All right, good.  But Jimmy, if I wanted to watch you do stand-up comedy, where would I go?  You'd probably Cleveland July 23rd if you happen to be around me.  I don't know about the Odeon gym.  I mean, after that. 
[03:38:00]  After that, I have no days planned because I have to go out to L.A. for Louis C.K.'s thing,  so I don't know how many other days.  I'm an actor.  Big old jet airliner.  Are you going to take my boys away?  All right, so you guys are coming out early August?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're doing the X Games out there, so.  Wow.  All right.  Well, I'll see you when you come out here.  We'll all roll.  We'll roll.  Cool, Jay.  We'll rock and roll.  All right, Jay.  Have fun when you see us.  All right.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, big dick daddy.  There he goes. 
[03:38:30]  A true friend of the show, Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Just calling because he wanted to.  All right.  Are we out of here?  2-2?  What does 2-2 mean, Hawk?  Stop whispering.  We need microphones.  2-2.  4-2.  2-2 means 4 minutes.  Why isn't 4 minutes 4 minutes?  Yeah, why are you Chuck Woolery all of a sudden?  What is 2-2?  2 minutes to the 2-minute warning.  So why don't you just say 4 minutes left?  We'll understand what that means.  We understand.  Does that mean it's 3 minutes to the 1 minute?  Is it 1-3?  1-2 now? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, listen up, you bag of douche.  If you said there were 4 minutes left and someone said,  when's the 2-minute warning?  Nobody would go, well, for Christ's sake, how long until that happens?  Now we've got to do math with you.  We do some subtraction.  2-2.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ron the Trucker.  Ron?  Yes.  Hey, Ron.  How you doing?  All right.  Hi, Ron.  I just want to tell Opie that you've got to use the category button on his radio  to get to his news channel.  Oh, that was Anthony.  All right.  That's me.  I don't know, no category. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, you hit the category button.  What category button?  And then it goes to the news channels, the rock channels.  Mine's built in in the Escalade.  The whatever channel.  Yeah, you use the category button, you tool.  Mine's built in.  I don't have a Sky-Fi or nothing like that.  You probably have a category button, though.  I don't think I do.  He doesn't.  All right.  Well, wow, this show just, uh...  No more lies about Anthony's radio.  Self-destructed.  After that crazy...  No, it was fine.  It was good.  All right.  Guys, you have anything?  You learned anything today?  Uh, I know.  I hope Dyson shows like a black graduation, a bunch of empty chairs and just two 25-year-old 
[03:40:00]  kids.  You are indeed a true racist.  And I just like to say fuck you to my brother-in-law's ex for asking him for $1,000 a week in fucking  alimony.  To who?  Her brother just got a divorce and his wife wanted $1,000 a week in alimony.  How much?  $1,000 a week.  Well, how is she supposed to afford that?  Who's afforded you a $1,000 a week?  Who's...  Fuck off. 
[03:40:30]  Wait, what relative is it?  Her brother just got a divorce.  We're not going to mention names.  My brother.  What?  Her brother.  Her brother.  Her what?  Her ex got a divorce, you dicks.  I just want to know how much a week.  $1,000.  To her brother?  Not to her brother, to my ex.  Her sister-in-law.  Ironically, there are no blacks in her family.  Not that we know of, anyway.  Left on a church doorstep, hopefully.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Eric on Long Island. 
[03:41:00]  Eric.  Oh, two minutes, Eric?  Is this the two minutes now?  One and one, people.  One and one.  No, now it's 1.56 since it started.  Is it five minus free?  Free.  Free.  Yeah, five minus free, Eagles.  Four minus free.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, thanks, Hawk.  Thank you to the girl that sent that pillow yesterday.  I don't remember your name.  I don't have it written down, but thank you so much.  I got your pillow, your lovely Bed, Bath & Beyond gift.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Yeah, a big Bed, Bath & Beyond box came for Jimmy yesterday, and I guess there was a nice  feather pillow in there.  No foam.  A lovely pillow and a lovely pillowcase. 
[03:41:30]  I think I'll think, I'll remember your name tomorrow.  It's written down.  You know who else travels?  Thanks, Ben.  Ben and his giant cock just rolled in here, and he said he had Regina written on the helmet.  Do you know Vince Van Patten travels with his own pillow also?  During his World Poker Tour thing.  We saw him outside of the hotel out there in Los Angeles after the poker tournament, and  he's got his bags, and he's holding a big red pillow.  That's just weird.  And it's like, why do you, it was all a hotel pillow, I'm in a lot of hotels, and the pillows  really suck, and Jimmy's just as crazy as Vince Van Patten. 
[03:42:00]  That fact should be in a book called World's Worst Trivia.  Like, who gives a flying fuck?  What does Vince Van Patten travel with?  Hopefully an illness that has no cure.  Let's go to Eric on Long Island.  Go ahead, Eric.  Yeah, I got a ridiculous word for the list.  All right.  Cattywampus.  What is cattywampus?  I have no idea.  I've heard people use it.  It's a word.  It's not a word.  It's a little too obscure for my list of funny words.  I like whirling dervish. 
[03:42:30]  So far, we got poopy, hiney, and lozenge.  Whirling dervish is pretty good.  Whirling dervish, but that's kind of two words.  Yeah.  Dr. Gonzo from Wackbag.  Today I learned that the subway wasn't the only thing from London that bombed today.  Oh, they didn't bomb.  They didn't bomb at all.  They did very well.  They were great.  Very funny line, though.  Chris from Boston.  He learned.  Hey, guys.  Today I learned Jimmy has a dinosaur baby head.  Proper grammar is I before E, except after hiney.  And sometimes when you pull out of an ass, you get a pink sock.
