<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them. The show began with a discussion of the movie *Downfall*, listener reactions to its portrayal of Hitler and drug use, and subsequent film recommendations like *Conspiracy*.  This segued into a critical assessment of the Star Wars prequels, particularly targeting Jar Jar Binks.  Interspersed throughout this segment was a seemingly staged, recurring advertisement for "Suits in Staten Island," a poker establishment, with Opie persistently urging Anthony to visit.  A listener-submitted song about Michael Jackson was played, followed by commentary on its audio quality.  Other topics in this early section included a news story about a bagel shop's subway-themed decor facing legal action, a discussion about awkward photoshoots, extensive commentary on Jay Leno's (and David Letterman's) Michael Jackson trial jokes, a listener's story about a "Saving Private Ryan" extra scene with Vin Diesel, the hosts receiving high-end poker chips and several sets of pornography playing cards, and criticism of Britney Spears's comments on the Michael Jackson trial.  Listener calls were frequent, some employing offensive language.  Drew Carey was mentioned as a possible guest, though his presence in the studio remains unclear.  "Ben," a staff member, was also mentioned as being present.

The show then shifted to Anthony's unreliable Saturn car, leading to jokes about his driving and female passengers. The conversation progressed to Howard Stern, Beth Ostrosky Stern, and criticisms of Howard's alleged control over Beth's career.  This transitioned into a discussion of Robin Quivers' unlikely talk show aspirations.  The hosts then performed their own crude song about Michael Jackson, followed by discussion of an upcoming live broadcast and the show's reduced length to three hours (with taped segments filling the remaining hour).  A fabricated, graphic, and humorous *Los Angeles Times* story about a gerbil-related accident involving a homosexual couple was presented, sparking a discussion about various sexual acts and cuckolding. The conversation took a surprising turn towards physics, specifically terminal velocity, prompted by a discussion of Mythbusters and elevator physics.  Opie and Frank (likely a producer) debated the physics of a falling elevator, expanding into a broader discussion of falling objects and terminal velocity. This led to a discussion of a high-altitude jump and Roswell conspiracy theories.  A "What Did We Learn Today?" phone segment followed, focusing on the gerbil story, the newly learned term "felching," further vulgar jokes and calls, Jim Norton's appearance, and promotion of WhackBag.com.  Opie recounted a story about Jim Norton's childhood game, "Monster Rain," involving oral sex, and a listener-created song based on the story.  The show's format, lack of office space, and overuse of George Carlin bits in commercials were also discussed.  The upcoming live broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe was mentioned again before concluding.


The final portion featured a raucous, sexually explicit song, "Monster Rain," by Chemistry from whackbag.com, based on a Jim Norton story.  The hosts discussed the song's graphic lyrics.  A listener-submitted audio recording, "Robification," depicting a woman with a dildo attached to a drill, was played.  The show covered technical difficulties with studio equipment, upcoming events (receiving a "lesbian couch" and Halloween plans), Opie's move to Long Island and trick-or-treating, Steve's clothing choices, listener complaints about show sweepstakes, negative comments from a building resident, Anthony's Florida improv shows, a listener prank about an early show ending, a newly permissible Jay Leno Michael Jackson joke, and a news story about a man who killed his wife and hid her body parts, including the head in a bowling bag, and a lengthy, expensive divorce case.  Numerous listener calls occurred throughout this final segment.

[01:23:00]  He's going to go to work for Panzerfaust.  No, I'm not working for Panzerfaust records. 
[01:23:30]  Himmler, shit dick.  Ted from Colorado.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, sweet Ted, how are you?  I'm better now, thanks.  Not you.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Anthony, I wanted to know if they portrayed Hitler doing all the methamphetamines and  shooting up dope.  And that's why he was so crazy, you know.  No, they didn't go into it. 
[01:24:00]  In the movie where they're portraying him as a human being.  No, they didn't go into any drug use.  I don't know how.  Hitler, I don't think, was using drugs.  I think toward the end the doctors were giving him stuff because he was insane, yeah.  But I don't think he was doing things like heroin.  The guy was kind of a health nut.  He was a vegetarian, which really proves Bernie Getz's point of people being very peaceful  if everybody was vegetarians.  Meanwhile, Hitler was a vegetarian.  You don't even have to go there.  Bernie Getz proved it himself when he lost his mind. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Those vegetarians, you've got to watch them.  They showed Hitler, though, eating and complimenting the chef on his cheese raviolis.  You know, the guy liked cheese ravioli.  That does sound good right now, actually.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  I love the Hitler.  I'm going to have to go see that movie.  What is it called again?  Downfall.  Downfall.  All right.  Let's say how to Tad in San Francisco.  Tad?  Hey, I can barely hear you guys, as you know.  But I just wanted to make a quick movie recommendation for Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  And that's a movie called Conspiracy.  It was done by HBO a couple years ago.  And it's about the meeting that the German high command, not all of them, but a few of  them, got together to lay out the final solution.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Stanley Tucci and Kenneth Branagh.  And it's probably the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life, that these people could  sit in a room and just lay out this plan to kill millions and millions of people. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Sounds like a feel-good movie.  Was it scarier than a grudge?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  All right.  Thanks, Tad.  Toolbag from New Orleans.  No, I totally understand, Anthony.  It bugs me, too, when I try to exterminate a race and just can't get it done.  What?  I wasn't saying.  No, I know.  Why am I being painted like this?  Yeah, it's great when you try to humanize Hitler. 
[01:26:00]  That always works.  Yeah.  You're going to get a lot of people on your side.  The Sarge, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, little Jimbo.  Hello, The Sarge.  Hey, there's a book you were talking about, reading a book about a movie and then watching  the movie and going back and forth about Saving Private Ryan.  It was a part that wasn't in the movie.  And it was played by a soon-to-be career-killed Vin Diesel's character, Caparzo.  And he's like, you know, Sarge, these beaches remind me of West Palm, where Jim Norton's 
[01:26:30]  going to be performing it, March 18th through the 20th, the Palm Beach Improv.  Very nice.  No, that was kind of a really, really bad one.  That was a good one.  It would have been good for his.  I would give props when it's good.  I didn't see that coming.  That was awful.  Yeah, it was so roundabout.  It was so out there.  That's why I kind of liked it.  An extra scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Vin Diesel?  I'm like, what?  Vin Diesel.  He was in that?  On the beach.  It was like...  I just, I didn't see it coming.  I saw something stupid coming.  That's what the problem was. 
[01:27:00]  I didn't see a plug, but I saw something stupid coming.  I didn't.  Really fast, because we're talking about movies.  We were going to talk about this Friday, the Star Wars trailer.  Yeah.  Saw that.  Looks pretty good.  It does look good.  It looks good.  You know, he's disappointed before, though.  Some of the trailers looked pretty good, and it turned out to be a stupid kiddie movie.  That first one was a goddamn kiddie movie.  He stinks.  The one he made with the little kid and the goddamn speeder race.  That stunk on ice.  The second one was Dawson's Creek in Space, which is that whining ass and what's-her-facey 
[01:27:30]  there.  Now it's looking dark, evil, a lot of death, a lot of destruction, high body count.  So it looks like it's pretty good.  I'm not one of those that says, I love the people that say, that's it, I'm not seeing  him anymore.  Because you know you're going to see it.  Right.  You know you're going to see the Star Wars movie.  Except Jim.  I haven't seen any of the new ones.  I'm no interested in that crap.  Have you seen the old ones?  Of course. 
[01:28:00]  See?  And I couldn't stand the stupid Ewoks.  They're awful.  Ruin that movie.  And the first one of the remakes was, you know, visually I love them.  They're great.  But the stories just stink.  Little Annie.  Hey Annie.  You're going to win the speeder race?  Ugh.  It was awful.  Jar Jar Binks.  He's a boob, George Lucas.  I'm sorry.  It was terrible.  But this last one looks like the dark one that it's supposed to be.  If you're setting up the prequel to the first one that was shown, the one with, you know, 
[01:28:30]  Luke Skywalker and stuff, there's no other way it could be than a dark movie.  Because, you know, they're all, they're in a pretty crappy situation in that first one.  And you've got to set up for that.  So it's got to be dark.  I think he knew that.  I think he took some of the criticism from a lot of the fans.  The fact the other ones were too light-hearted, nice, and, you know, kid-like.  Yeah.  And make it nice and dark.  Looks good.  High body count, you know.  Well, Anakin goes out there and he kills a lot of Jedi. 
[01:29:00]  So it can't be a light, fun movie.  Just the fact that there's no Darth Vader yet, it's like, all right, get on with it.  He's Darth at the end.  And he's kind of the beginnings of Darth Vader.  Still the best.  It's one of the best bad guys ever created in films, ever.  It ends with him being Darth, though.  You can't, like, jump ahead.  That's the whole thing.  I'm sure it is, but you've got to put more Darth Vader footage.  That would be interesting.  But there is at the end of the movie.  He's got to become Darth Vader.  You show him.  And he is Vader in this one. 
[01:29:30]  He's just the Vader before the costume.  Yeah.  It shows how he turns into the evil bastard.  How about by part two they do that, and then part three is all new Vader footage.  Yeah, how about that?  Stop with the faggity characters, you weak-chinned, irrelevant idiots.  Didn't you feel bad for Vader when they took the helmet off and he was kind of crying for Luke at the end?  Kind of felt bad for him.  An old guy looking at his young son and like he couldn't.  Peter Cushing came in and said, look, I know you told me to destroy the planet, but I just couldn't blow it up.  And he dropped a little tear.  Millions of lives snuffed out in an instant when the Death Star blew up the planet. 
[01:30:00]  But I kind of felt bad for him there.  I did, too.  Anthony, before we go to break, I noticed next to your computer those poker chips.  Yeah.  I got to bring those home.  What do you think?  I like them.  Really cool, right?  They're pretty cool.  They're very pro.  Yeah, somebody...  Carrying case.  If I take my game on the road.  Yeah, somebody sent you the top-of-the-line poker chips.  Top-of-the-line poker chips.  Huh?  Ooh.  Just somebody thought Anthony might, you know, like poker chips. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  It comes in and what, like a nice metal case?  You saw it, right?  Metal case, a couple of decks of cards.  Right.  Yeah, that was very cool.  Have you heard of sweets and...  Or sweets or suits?  Suits, I think.  Suits in Staten Island?  Suits in Staten Island?  Because I know you like the poker.  Yeah.  You got the...  Here they are, the poker chips.  Never heard of it.  Eric brought them in.  Ooh, open that case up.  And I got an anonymous present from one of our listeners.  It's top-of-the-line poker chips.  Look at that.  Oh.  Here, I want you to...  Geez.  Listen how heavy they are. 
[01:31:00]  Nice, right?  These are the real deal.  And you like your poker, right?  I sure do.  Got the place for you, man.  Yeah.  It's called Suits in Staten Island.  Yeah.  And...  It's a little out-of-the-way place.  You can't really...  What?  Well, you're liking the poker chips, right?  I definitely dig the chips, yeah.  Here, make that noise again.  Look how heavy they are.  They're very...  See?  Top-of-the-line.  Real clay chips.  I like them.  Well, I just know this place.  It's called Suits in Staten Island.  This... 
[01:31:30]  I love when you hear this.  You walk into a casino, and you hear this sound, just amplified by a hundred people doing  it.  That sound just gets me.  Can I see one, Eric?  I love this.  You like, though, right?  Yeah.  And you like your poker.  Yeah.  I found the place for you.  Oh, and...  It's out of the...  It's out of the...  You got any connection to this place?  Have you been there?  How do you know about it, Opie?  Why are you plugging it on the show?  No, it's just that I just know you like poker, and, you know, we're friends, and I  figured, you know, Suits in Staten Island is the place for you. 
[01:32:00]  Is Spider making the drinks?  It's just...  It's just out of the way.  You know, it's not a very obvious place.  Uh-huh.  I'll give you the address after the show, if listeners want to maybe, I don't know,  play a little, like, poker, or maybe the slots that they have in the back back.  They got slots in the back room.  A couple blackjack tables, but it's mostly a poker place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I should go there? 
[01:32:30]  I was thinking.  You want to send me there?  Well, it...  I...  You know, I just know you're a poker fan.  Yeah.  I think it would be a very, very cool thing for you to check this place out.  How about I just have a friendly game with people I know in my house, and I don't go  to...  Where is this?  You don't want to go to Suits in Staten Island?  In Staten Island?  Nah.  You sure?  Nah.  Staten Island, too much water around Staten Island.  Too many opportunities to maybe slip off the edge of Staten Island and end up in a river 
[01:33:00]  somewhere.  Nice little place off Toad Hill Road?  Yeah.  Nice.  You gotta ask for...  You know, you have to ask for somebody.  You can't just, you know...  You have to go...  Oh, really?  Around back?  Well, you park your car around back.  Say, Fat Anthony sent me?  I'm not...  I don't think...  I shouldn't use Fat Anthony as a reference?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  you don't...  No, no, no, no.  Fat Anthony has nothing to do with Suits in Staten Island.  Right.  But I think you would enjoy it.  Maybe on a Friday night you go up there, play a little, just a little, and then maybe, 
[01:33:30]  maybe, I don't know, you come back on the show next Monday and just, you know, tell me  how it was.  Talk about it?  Yeah, just a little bit.  Talk about it?  Just a little.  They got a nice game going on.  Uh-huh.  Nice game.  Mostly on the weekends, but we could get a little private game going if you want.  All right.  I'll have to look into that.  Suits.  Suits in Staten Island.  You like the poker chips, right?  Oh, I dig them.  Why, where'd they come from?  You like them, right? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  No, here, here, here's your poker chips back.  Just enjoy, okay?  Hey, here's your poker chips.  Enjoy.  There you go.  Consider this a gift.  There you go.  Someday, and that day may never come, you may be asked to play poker at an establishment.  All right, glad to hear it.  Suits in Staten Island, if, you know.  I'll give you the address off air.  I just think you're unlucky.  Huh?  What?  No, I'm just talking about the, uh...  Your casinos lose money. 
[01:34:30]  All right, we should take a break, Anthony.  Don't talk to a man like Mo Green like that!  Mike!  And you walk...  When he walks...  The dancers will kick your tongue out.  These evil angel cards are so sexy.  Yeah, well, Anthony got the real, uh, the real playing cards, and then someone also sent  in a, uh...  Yoshi, I'm sure.  Someone sent in, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  The evil angel, the porn company, they have these cards. 
[01:35:00]  They're hardcore, oh my God.  Yeah, hardcore porno playing cards.  Wow, these are great.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Walk, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Oh, Jesus.  Anthony, why don't we take a break?  All right.  You like the poker chips, though?  Oh, I really like them.  I'm digging them.  Cool.  And you would, you would at least consider going to suits instead, aren't I?  Yeah, consider it.  Okay, good.  Um, when we come back, you know how we talk about that gerbil story? 
[01:35:30]  It's something we talk about from time to time on the program?  Uh, yes.  In retrospect, lighting the match, blah, blah, blah.  Who hasn't gotten that one in their email years ago?  Well, we found, um, we found an actual, you know, newscaster that did the story as real.  As a real news story?  That started the whole phenomenon.  Oh, my God.  Where people thought this was a real story, even though it was like some kind of urban legend thing.  I'm all in.  That went, uh, mainstream.  Where's the Ace of Spades, Eric?  So, we'll get into that. 
[01:36:00]  We got to talk about these guys in the paper doing the homo picture.  Oh, these guys fell for it.  They fell for it.  We'll explain next.  Listen to your pal's O&A and never fall for that gag.  That old gag.  Also, uh, Jacko Tahacko at Boyd today.  What?  That's the latest, uh, headline on Michael Jackson.  Jacko Tahacko.  Oh, wow.  These idiots in the paper.  That's the New York Post.  They love that.  It rhymes.  Yeah.  Jacko Tahacko. 
[01:36:30]  They can't get enough of the Jacko headline.  Well, Jacko's...  They love it.  Jacko's team is going to be, you know, cross-examining the, uh, the accuser.  The Post loves doing that.  Look at the Ace of Spades.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus.  Figures it's the Ace of Spades.  There's a young girl about to enjoy a penis, which happens to be dark, with a pink head.  And you can't even see the guy in it.  The dick just cuts across the entire card.  It's really frightening.  You've got to respect this guy. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  Yeah, he shows up.  His body is on, like, the two.  Hey, Ben, we have the Sunday papers?  Yes.  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  All right, they had, they had some of Leno's, they had some of Leno's lines.  He is just going all out with this Jacko.  Dude, I'm telling you, Leno's the guy.  He's basically doing pedophile humor every night on NBC.  And I'm starting to, I'm starting to believe that he's the man.  I didn't like the Leno.  Dude, he, the fact that he will do that, Letterman, you watch the way Letterman will tap dance around this and do a top ten list, which is irrelevant to what's going on. 
[01:37:30]  Top ten reasons Michael Jackson can't buy brown shoes.  Ha ha ha!  Oh, he's a hoot.  Yes.  Do we have the post?  Because it's going to be a...  Number two, he's bad, but not as bad as he used to be.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  The post just looked for a wacko reference.  A Jacko.  They love the Jacko.  All right, we'll find it after break. 
[01:38:00]  But they just, they did some of the best lines that he's done so far, and I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  And you wonder why the Tonight Show has just beaten the dog shit out of it.  It's great.  They're killing Letterman.  Well, here's a little sample from Leno's monologue.  This is when he had the other comedians, you know, standing in for him.  Check this one.  I think this is the Drew Carey one.  Well, according to a story just released today, Michael Jackson is broke.  Really?  ABC is reporting that he is not able to make his payroll for the Neverland Ranch.  Give me a note how broke he is. 
[01:38:30]  Last night at the dinner table, the kid said, llama again?  Sticky.  Now, as you know, I have been called as a witness in the Michael Jackson.  They're ruling on my gag order tomorrow to see if I'm allowed to tell jokes.  Oh, really?  Because I am not legally allowed to tell Michael Jackson jokes, but I can still write them.  So we are now bringing in surrogate comedians.  All right.  Guest comedians.  Please welcome a great stand-up comic.  Next Thursday, he'll be in Albuquerque watching the U.S. play Honduras in soccer.  Did you know that?  Please welcome a good friend, Drew Carey.  Drew, come on out. 
[01:39:00]  Nice to be here.  Thank you very much.  You know, Michael Jackson showed up in court late today wearing his pajama bottoms.  You know what?  We find the kid wearing the pajama top.  We have another court case in our hands.  Yeah, he showed up in court.  He was looking stiff, awkward.  He had difficulty moving.  Hey, maybe he is really white.  The official word for the Jackson camp is he has a hurt back. 
[01:39:30]  Hey, kids are heavier now.  What are you going to do?  What does Michael Jackson call a school bus?  Neals on wheels, everybody.  You know where Michael's two favorite places to go on vacation are?  Youngstown in Boise. 
[01:40:00]  What does Michael Jackson never say after having sex?  Why don't you grow up?  This is really, this is disturbing.  This is disturbing?  Disturbing.  This is going to be disturbing.  The accuser's brother testified that Michael Jackson walked around naked and aroused.  And here's the creepy part.  It was at Chuck E. Cheese.  That was the creepy part. 
[01:40:30]  Yesterday, we heard testimony from the accuser's younger brother, or as Michael calls him, plan B.  Yeah, observers say that Michael rarely looked at his accuser on the stand.  And, uh, well, of course he didn't.  The kid's 15 now.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar. 
[01:41:00]  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth.  Anthony and Anthony.  XM202.  You've got to save that shit for the air, bro. 
[01:41:30]  Ben.  There are some message board people that hate you, Ben.  Why?  Hate you.  There was one guy just bitching about Ben and how he doesn't belong on the air and you suck.  And, and how Rick, uh, Rick was a better producer because he wasn't on the air as much as Ben is.  And that's when I was just like, get the fuck out of here. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, my God.  Who signed it?  Uh, R.D.?  Oh, God.  I love when Ben's on the air.  I do, too.  I know.  He only comes on the air when he has something really good to add.  What do you have to add today?  Now that you're in studio in front of a mic.  That's right.  Turn on the mic.  Can someone turn on Austin Powers' microphone?  Austin Powers.  Young, young Austin. 
[01:42:30]  It's not bad.  This is very bright.  It's nice and colorful.  It is very colorful.  The weather's getting nice, Jim.  That's true.  What's up?  It is.  Yes.  Oh, it's open window weather, Ben?  Dude, that office was about a thousand degrees when I got in there.  A thousand degrees.  Metal was melting.  It was hot.  For some reason, our office was hot.  How hot was it?  Top ten reasons it was hot.  Ha, ha, ha.  Don't talk about the pedophile on fucking trial.  Fucking love Leno for doing that.  Beautiful. 
[01:43:00]  Leno, very funny.  Bring in Letterman's monologue.  Let's compare the two and see who's really addressing what's going on.  Yeah.  All right, we'll do that tomorrow.  Leno is attacking that pedophile.  Good.  Very funny.  That's what he is.  He's a fucking pedophile.  This stupid country has overprotected him, and it's just great to see Leno going after  him like that.  Good.  Good for Leno.  Yeah, we'll do the old comparison tomorrow.  I'm not saying that Letterman wasn't a good comic or doesn't have good jokes, but it's  just such this misnomer that Letterman's like the hip New York guy, and Leno's a square, 
[01:43:30]  and here he is in L.A. doing this edgy pedophile shit on the same time slot while you look across  the street.  No victims in the jokes on this side, guys.  That's true.  New York adds to it.  No victims.  You don't think it might be CBS that's cramping his style, or you just think he's an unfunny  boob?  I don't think, I would say maybe it was CBS having something to do with it, but you know  what, they have the same type of advertisers as NBC does.  Gotta give it to NBC, though, man. 
[01:44:00]  They are letting Leno get away with some really risque, pedophile jokes.  They let the last comic standing comedians do it.  I've dealt with them.  They're great.  As long as it's not an FCC and it's not too over the top, they're great.  They're by far the best network.  CBS and ABC just really dropping the ball at comedy.  I remember you doing a rape bit or something.  Yeah, well, there was one joke the censor asked me to take out.  He's like, that's a little too great.  I'm like, yeah, no problem.  And I think he was right.  He was like, yeah, that was a little much for prime time.  Whatever.  It was fine.  Leave it to you to find the line.  But I didn't mind it. 
[01:44:30]  It made sense.  I mean, I'm not a moron.  I mean, I know you can't say certain things, but it's just great to see a comic just doing  that.  That's what a comic is supposed to do.  All right.  Oh, it's fantastic.  You want to talk about the bagel guys really fast?  Yeah.  And then we got to get to the story of the weekend.  The whole, uh...  Oh, the old guy.  Yeah, the old guy and the, uh...  And the old nagging wife.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  And her getting her comeuppance.  Oh, yeah, she did.  Yeah, she did.  Comeuppance.  Comeuppance.  I was eating my bagels, so maybe this is a good little segue. 
[01:45:00]  There's a picture in the New York Post today.  It's called Shmear Campaign.  Shmear Campaign.  I get it, because it's a bagel story.  Here's the story.  Let's see.  Fareed.  Fareed.  Fareed.  Fowad.  Asad.  Uh-oh.  Guilty.  What is going on in this bagel shop?  Uh-oh.  Fareed and Fowad didn't know they were tangling with the MTA when they adorned their bagel shop 
[01:45:30]  with Subway memorabilia.  So they have this bagel shop, I guess, in Brooklyn.  It's called F-Line Bagels.  Are you plugging this, Opie?  Nah.  Fuck these guys.  Oh.  Okay.  Language.  I don't need a plug.  I got a great bagel shop.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah, I do.  Brooklyn?  We'll get into that later, and it's probably, yeah, the competition of F-Line Bagels.  Let me tell you.  F-Line Bagels.  Right.  Okay.  Suits in Staten Island.  Yeah.  Ask for Vinnie Dice. 
[01:46:00]  Vinnie Dice is the guy.  I was trying to remember who you have to ask for when you bang on the back door.  Vinnie Dice.  Uh, bagel shop locks horns with MTA.  So a Brooklyn bagel shop may have to fork over some dough to the MTA because it looks like  a subway station.  So, you know, these guys come up with a good idea.  They're going to sell bagels, but they're going to make it look like a subway stop.  That's a great idea.  And they call it F-Line because all the subways here in New York are letters like the A-Line,  the C-Line.  Yeah, exactly.  So they decide to call theirs the F-Line.  The owner of F-Line Bagels, uh, has ordered the deli, all right, so the, uh, the MTA 
[01:46:30]  has ordered the deli to change its name and remove subway memorabilia or pay them a fee  to avoid trademark infringement.  Are you kidding me?  These poor bastards are just trying to eke out a living with a business.  And they come up with this little niche, they think it's a little niche, it's a clever  idea.  Well, could they call it something else that might reflect the subway, like a late and  overpriced with chimp employees?  Would that be an infringement on the MTA, you dickheads? 
[01:47:00]  Scent of urine?  Yeah, perhaps you could, uh...  When was the last time you rode a subway that you would even know what's going on?  Well, apparently I rode one pretty recently if I yanked that one out.  All right.  I didn't think we were doing anything wrong, they said.  The whole thing is odd.  Why are they going after us?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Look at your first names.  Yeah, exactly.  That was the excuse to get into the bagel shop to make sure nothing's going on there.  Yeah.  So, uh, who cares?  That isn't even the story.  It's really a who cares story.  I could care less about this stupid bagel shop in Brooklyn. 
[01:47:30]  But a little advice to these guys, because, uh, I don't know, a quick look at them.  They look like they're heterosexual men.  Regular guys.  Regular guys.  Regular guys.  Trying to make it, and they probably have a lot of people that are, a lot of family and  friends that are seeing their photograph in the paper today.  They got their company shirt and hats on.  Right.  Good exposure.  Good exposure for the place.  But the problem is, the photographer told them to do something, and they went for it. 
[01:48:00]  And they did it.  And I saw this picture, and it just reminded me of many, many times where Ant and I have  been photographing or a story or something where the photographer or the interviewer,  you know, has this great idea.  I heard that one too, Jimmy.  Is that a fart?  No.  No.  He's laughing at photographer.  The photographer.  Photographer.  Yeah, or that.  Jimmy just looks and starts cracking up. 
[01:48:30]  I just looked at Ant for a second to make sure that I did hear that correctly.  I think you could use the word photographer, though.  Can you?  Ah.  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  The photographer.  You sure he didn't fart, though?  No, no, no.  Not to totally get it off me.  No, I did not fart, bro.  Probably the egg whites or something.  I did not guess.  Someone have egg whites?  Yeah, I got egg whites.  Yeah, why does egg whites smell and fart?  Egg whites just stink like farts.  All right, so.  Anyway, they got a photograph of these guys. 
[01:49:00]  And it reminded me of.  A photographer?  Yeah, I know.  And it reminded me of many times where these guys wanted us to do something wacky for their  article.  They always want the wacky picture of, well, when we're photographed, of us interacting  somehow too closely.  Can you guys sit on the couch?  Maybe you could sit and, Anthony, you can maybe sit on Opie's knee.  Right.  Or do something that ridiculous.  Could you sit on his lap?  Yeah.  Because we can't get you both in the frame. 
[01:49:30]  What?  We can't get you.  How about you guys?  What?  Guys, put your arms around each other and put your cheeks together and smile.  And every time we've gone, no.  No.  No.  No.  Well, the most recent one.  Yeah.  There has been the ones after the whole, you know, Sex with Sam thing.  Yeah.  Could we get a picture of you guys in front of us?  Having ass sex in a church?  Right.  In front of the church.  It'll just be in the background.  Yeah.  And you look all sad and serious.  And there'll be a picture of you two. 
[01:50:00]  And then, you know, St. Pat's in the background.  Yeah.  Where then someone decided, well, can we get you guys in pre-s outfits?  Yeah.  And we'll take your picture.  No.  What, Jimmy?  You're wrecking my whole bit.  Well, I'm not wrecking you a bit.  Go ahead.  Not that it's a great one, but.  Go ahead.  I'm not.  What are you pissing off at?  And why would Ben hand it to you in the middle of the show?  Just to get you really annoyed.  Ben, what are you doing?  You trail maker.  What's going on over there?  Just an instant feedback about Jim and his Leno comments.  It was funny.  Oh, go ahead.  What was it?  Some guy said I was full of shit that Leno sucks. 
[01:50:30]  I just.  Well, let me tell you something.  I thought you were.  You know, because I've hated Leno for many, many years.  I always thought, like, Letterman was the hip cat and more of a natural.  But, you know, Leno's been impressing me with this Michael Jackson stuff.  Jimmy is such full of shit.  Leno sucks.  Someday he'll realize he's as fake as Gene Simmons.  His same delusion, which he spells D-I-L-U-S-S-I-O-N.  Dude, I think.  Jay from.  I think Leno after the.  Dope, Jay.  I think Leno, you know, kills Letterman as far as the monologue goes and the joke telling, 
[01:51:00]  you know?  Obviously.  It's not even close.  But then after that, I agree with him.  Leno is like, it's all just so calculated.  And, you know, he's trying to have that same thing that Johnny Carson had going where, you  know, he just went with the flow.  Yeah.  You know, I think Letterman does a much better job with that.  Maybe Letterman's better in certain areas.  Much better.  As a stand-up.  You know, the main thing is tomorrow.  We're talking stand-up.  Well, we'll compare tomorrow.  We'll compare tomorrow and see what's going on in the two camps there as far as the Michael 
[01:51:30]  Jackson humor goes.  So, Anthony, so they wanted to get us in priest outfits for an interview.  And then recently, we did this in Proper or something it's called, Way Out East.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Remember what they wanted to do?  I forgot what they wanted us to do, but I remember her saying something and us going,  no, it shan't happen.  She brought it in.  What was it?  She wanted us, the female interviewer, to put on an oversized shirt.  Oh, with both of us in one shirt. 
[01:52:00]  Both of us in one shirt.  Like, I'd put my arm out one sleeve, Opie would put his arm out the other, and our heads  would go through the neck, and we'd be in one shirt.  And they get so disappointed when we don't want to do any of this stuff.  That would ever, ever happen.  Imagine on what planet is this woman going to that we are doing that, because it is  not Earth.  Anthony made one mistake when we first started.  He just didn't know any better.  Oh, the famous fire extinguisher picture.  Our first publicity photo.  That wasn't a publicity picture, though.  Oh, they used it?  They were taking a bunch of pictures of us, and that was one of many. 
[01:52:30]  When we first started doing radio together, we went up to AAF in Boston.  Yeah.  That was, so what you decided...  It ended up on the website.  I didn't pick and choose that one.  There were 20 pictures of me taken that day.  One of them was me with, like, my hair like a complete ragged afro, and I was, like, scrunching  up my face, and I had a fire extinguisher in my hand, and I pointed at the camera, and 
[01:53:00]  they put that up on the website, and when we got fired, every news agency decided that  was the picture that they had of me, so they pulled it off the website.  There's that wacky photograph.  Oh, it's awful.  Where Anthony's pointing the fire extinguisher hose at the camera person.  At least it's not as bad as, like, two of us doing something stupid.  Wow.  Like, it's not as bad as...  It's bad, believe me, but it's not like this with the bagel guys.  I'm trying to remember if there's any other really bad shots out there.  I'm sure the freaking fans will find them and post them. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  But anyway, so getting back to these bagel dudes from F-Line Bagels.  So, you know, they do the story, and they got the two guys, I guess they're the co-owners  or whatever, and they want a photograph in front of their joint.  Yep.  So, I know it wasn't their idea.  No.  No, they wouldn't do...  This is something they wouldn't do on their own.  The photographer said, hey, guys, how about...  How about you guys both have a bagel in your hand?  Yeah.  And you feed each other the bagel.  Feed each other the bagel, like a newly married couple. 
[01:54:00]  So, there they are.  And this guy looks...  Cheek to cheek, just about.  This guy looks completely awkward.  It's like...  It's awful.  Yeah, go ahead, Ann.  They're just about cheek to cheek.  They're holding the bagels, crossing arms over each other's arms, and one bagel is in  one guy's mouth, and he's taking a bite, and the other guy has his mouth open,  waiting, waiting, yearning.  Waiting for his...  Waiting for his big bagel to end up in his mouth. 
[01:54:30]  It looks so gay.  This looks like a gay wedding story, if you look at it.  And I just hope their family and friends are just abusing the piss out of these two guys.  Look how you look, my friend.  You look like sissy, my friend.  Look how stupid you look today in the post.  But that's those photographers.  They always want to get the goofy angle.  Yeah.  And they will always use the goofiest picture they can take of you.  They could take 500 pictures where 499 of them will look pretty cool, where you would  look at it and go, okay, any one of these would be fine. 
[01:55:00]  That one picture that's all goofy or a bad shot, that's the one they'll use.  That's the one they'll run.  Look at every picture of Hillary Clinton that the post has put in.  They only print that picture of her with her mouth open and her eyes open real wide, like  she just walked in on Bill getting a blowjob.  That's her exact face.  Eyes open wide, mouth in an O.  And that's the only picture they use of her.  Yeah.  So if the press is ever trying to take your picture, a little public service, never listen 
[01:55:30]  to the photographer.  If your instinct is, no, that's stupid, it's stupid.  Then the photographer always gets bombed as far as you and I are concerned.  We're like, no, just snap away.  Snap away.  That's all you're getting today.  Snap away.  Occasionally, I'll give them the eyebrow.  I'll give them the people's eyebrow.  Yeah.  We'll go with that.  All right.  Before you do that, can I just finish up the Michael Jackson thing?  This is everything that's wrong with celebrity, and they're just garbage, these people.  Britney Spears advises Jackson to toughen up. 
[01:56:00]  She's offered him some strange advice to Michael Jackson to get his life back together.  He should get drunk and start a fight in a bar.  Toxic star Spears believes that Jackson needs to adopt a more masculine persona and get embroiled  in a punch-up to help toughen him up, regardless of whether he is guilty or not of the allegations.  She tells American Magazine Allure, if he did these things, I feel sorry for him.  I feel like he probably feels alone and that he needs some help. 
[01:56:30]  Is she insane?  This fucking pig.  Is that the best you can say about a guy who's been molesting children for 20 years?  Is that what you have to offer, you middle-of-the-road twat?  If he did it, she feels sorry for him.  Oh, and then he needs someone to be like, okay, let's buck you up, let's give you a mustache,  let's rough you up, let's go to a bar, get drunk, and be a man.  So she's saying the punishment should be a makeover.  Basically, yeah.  That's pretty much what she's saying.  Well, then she says, and if he didn't do these things, I feel sorry for him.  Either way, he needs to get in a fight. 
[01:57:00]  Just what fucking drivel.  That's like feeling sorry for a crying Hitler or something.  Yeah, it's silly.  That's insane.  You know he's guilty of these crimes, and yet you still feel bad for him?  Preposterous.  He told Tito to smother the children so they couldn't do anything,  and Tito came in and said, I couldn't kill them.  I couldn't kill them.  Michael's all upset.  Maybe a tear rolls down his eyes, and you feel a little bad.  Sure.  It's just that's what she has to say about this whole thing.  It's just everything that's wrong with celebrity in this country. 
[01:57:30]  Got a little song from Pappy.  Pappy?  About the Michael Jackson case.  All right.  I haven't heard this yet.  Do you want to take a little listen?  See if it's good?  Uh-oh.  We haven't heard it?  Uh-oh.  Could be a disaster.  Could be a disaster.  Could be good.  All right.  Jack-o-likes kids so young.  They make the king of pop pop his spring.  And every child he...  All right.  Is this going to be a problem out there in Radio Land?  That sounds weird to me, too.  It's only in one channel. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, it is?  It's only in one channel.  It is?  It's only in one channel.  It is?  It's only in one channel.  It is?  Where's that other copy of the song, Eric?  Hawk.  No, it's not right in front of me because...  Oh, all right.  You make me feel so young.  I love that song.  Stupid Regis.  I was on a plane and I actually heard the Frank Sinatra version of that.  Yeah.  And I started laughing when he started singing it.  Because all I could think of was the Regis version.  You make me feel so young.  I'll stick my dick in your bong. 
[01:58:30]  All the dopey lines we came up with.  Let's see if there's a better version.  Jack O'Lex, kids so young.  I hear it in both ears.  What?  I do, too, but it sounds different.  I hear it in both ears.  Huh?  I only hear it in one side.  Really?  Turn it on.  Let me hear it.  I'm not going down this road.  No?  Because I know what's going to happen.  And then if it turns out to be a really good song, everyone's going to be like, hey,  dicks.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah.  Let me hear it.  Sounds good there.  Jack O'Lex, kids so young. 
[01:59:00]  I hear it in both ears.  They make the king of pop.  No way.  Pop is spring.  You don't hear it in one ear?  No.  Every child he fills with gin.  Through one ear it comes in great, and through one it sounds, the vocals are tinny.  Interesting.  What can we do?  Feed each other bagels.  Oh, my God.  Are you just guessing?  Feed each other bagels.  Very loud and distorted vocals.  Just a heads up.  No.  I'm not even going to chance it.  It'll drive us nuts, and we're trying to, like, not be nuts.  Yeah, we're trying to bitch less.  We're trying anyway. 
[01:59:30]  We'll see what happens.  Good luck with that.  See if you can get a better copy of that.  Or tell Pappy it's got to be in both, uh, screw this stereo crap.  Screw the stereo crap.  Just get it in both, uh, Pepsi.  Oh, our coffee.  Oh, more coffee?  You guys are just ridiculous with your coffee.  I'm only having two.  I've been trying to cut down those.  This is only my second.  I know.  I do five or six a day, but this is only my second.  And then I wonder why I can't sleep.  Dude, once we move to, like, three to seven, I don't want to shut up. 
[02:00:00]  That's the strategy.  An hour at a time.  Believe me.  You know, if you put, uh, what do they say?  If you put a crab in boiling water, he'll move around like crazy.  But if you put him in cold water and slowly heat it up, he'll just sit there until he cooks.  That's what we're doing.  An hour at a time.  Little incremental changes.  And then before you know it, we're doing afternoon drive and people are like, weren't they in morning?  Wait, the crab doesn't move? 
[02:00:30]  Yes.  If you heat the water up real slow.  Is it less painful?  The crab will just sit there and won't even notice that it's boiling before he cooks.  He knows a little bit about everything.  But if you throw him into boiling water, of course, he's going to be like, hey, ow.  How long does he move around for in boiling water?  Not long at all.  Oh, it's quick.  I don't like to eat seafood.  By the way.  Seafood, eat food.  By the way, the boys in the other booth are always looking for ideas for promos.  Yes.  A promo about Anthony knowing a little bit about everything.  Ah, a little bit about everything.  A little tad, a little chip of knowledge about every little thing. 
[02:01:00]  It just comes out of nowhere half the time.  People are saying the song sounds fine.  I don't know, man.  Some people, but remember last time some people said it was fine.  I know.  Let Eric go into the other room and see if he could fix it up a little bit.  You just stirred with that pen, Opie.  How do you stir your coffee with a pen?  Guys have been chewing on that pen.  And I wonder why I had the flu for three weeks.  Yeah.  I can't understand it.  It helps the immune system.  What are you stirring your coffee with?  It's a little toilet brush. 
[02:01:30]  What's the matter with you?  I still have a little something three weeks later.  All right.  Well, we got this stupid little thing.  You want to listen to this real fast?  No, there's that stuck in my head.  You make me feel so young.  Want to hear a little some-some?  Sure.  I like it when they trade down, like, I was saying to Baba Buhai, like, if Beth and I  broke up, and then I read in the paper she was dating, like, but if she was with, like,  Mark and Brian or Imus, that would suck.  You know what I mean?  You don't want anybody in radio. 
[02:02:00]  No.  That would really, really blow.  There's Beth-O and Mancow.  Yeah.  Like, that would suck.  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, look who's there.  Or where's even Beth-O and Anthony?  You're right.  Yeah.  Opie.  Beth-O and Opie and Anthony.  Beth-O and Anthony.  The new show.  Right.  That, come on.  That would kill you, wouldn't it? 
[02:02:30]  You're laughing.  You're laughing.  No, you know what?  I'd fuck her.  Good.  That would kill you.  I don't want that.  I'd give her a good tooling.  Jesus Christ.  Beth-O and Anthony.  Unlike you, Howard, Anthony's got a huge hog.  Oh, forget about it.  It's one of those fat Italian ones.  It's like a Foster's can.  I haven't seen it live, but just the reaction when women look at it.  Jesus Christ.  It's like when they see Kong for the first time, chained up on stage,  knowing it could just rip you to pieces if it's unleashed. 
[02:03:00]  Get out of here.  Beth-O.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I'm going to put a bridle and saddle on her.  That was some rider.  That was some brilliant, clever, entertaining radio.  That was good.  I don't think we could repeat with that.  Beth-O and Anthony.  And then playing, like what, some kind of psycho music?  I think that's, wow, that's impressive.  Would I have to go out to the Hamptons with her every weekend or she'd be all bitchy at me? 
[02:03:30]  Maybe you could just...  Howie used to take me to the Hamptons.  Maybe you could just banger in the huge stretch black Escalade limo thing that he's driving around trying to be incognito.  Does he even drive anymore?  No, he doesn't drive.  He doesn't drive his own vehicle like he's driven everywhere?  No, no, no.  That must be nice.  No.  That's got to be nice, though.  Your car pulls up, you jump in, and it takes you where you want to go. 
[02:04:00]  And then when you're there, you don't got to park, you don't got to do anything.  You just jump out and go to your event.  It's a great way to keep in touch with your listeners, you know?  Yeah.  It really is.  It gives you more time to keep in touch with them because you don't have to worry about driving and what the average driver goes through coming into Manhattan for a morning show like Anthony does.  Yeah.  Well, can't relate.  No, I think he can relate more because he has more free time to relate to the listeners.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  You know?  I'd like some more free time to relate to the listeners because I have no time in my Saturn to relate to them at all. 
[02:04:30]  Oh.  I'm putzing around town trying to find whores in a family sedan.  Fucking loser.  Do you lease or did you buy?  I bought.  It paid off.  You bought?  First time I ever owned a car.  It's all paid off?  Yeah, yeah.  Three years.  And what are you going to?  Are you going to keep it?  Or are you going to upgrade it?  I have like $30,000 on it, dude, but it's having some problems.  It is already?  Only because in New York, the city driving is so brutal on a vehicle.  It really beats up a car.  It kills you.  But it's the first time in my life.  As of like six months ago, I've never had a paid off car before in my life.  That must be a nice feeling.  It's fun to not have to pay, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  What about your insurance, Jimmy?  Is that high?  Eh, it's $15,000 a year or $1,000.  I don't even remember what it is because it's not that bad.  I haven't got a ticket in so many years.  Another city really blows.  Yeah, I don't mind.  I'm not going to get a new car until I move back out to the suburbs.  That's still what I waited for.  I'm going to beat the crap out of my car now because it just gets dinged.  You know, some of these work trucks park right in front of you and their tools fall right  on your hood.  They don't care.  Side view mirror is gone.  You should see the crap that's on the hood of my car.  I'm like, what is this?  Did they drop bricks on it today?  Yep. 
[02:05:30]  The city's the worst place to have a vehicle.  A new car.  A new car anywhere.  Yep.  You want an old piece of crap.  Yeah, I just, it's running a little bit sluggish.  It's kind of, I brought it into the same Saturn dealership like 30 times and I'm still having  like these weird little problems.  It's like, just make it run better.  My fucking engine light won't stop coming on.  It's running sluggish because it's a Saturn.  It's a three-year-old Saturn.  Oh, are you kidding?  My other Saturn, I've had this one.  I got 160,000 out of my other one.  Really?  Dude, I've never, this one has only not started one time.  I've had great success with these cars. 
[02:06:00]  That's why I buy them.  Only not started one time.  That's one time too many.  No, but it was a, but this is why I like Saturn.  It was a battery.  It was like some kind of a.  What did you do?  Did you hit your OnStar and go, my car won't start and they send somebody and fix it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But my OnStar is even better than yours because it comes in my pocket and Sprint does it.  So I just, I pick it up.  No, actually it's twice it didn't start.  Once it actually just broke down.  Yeah.  I really had enough of this fucking Saturn.  Three years and you already have it breaking down on you.  Yeah, this one's not as good as the other ones, man.  I don't know though, dude, you beat the crap out of your cars. 
[02:06:30]  Not really, dude.  I got less than 30,000 on it in three years.  I used to do 30,000 a year when I was living in Jersey.  90,000 by this point is what I would have on it and it was still going good.  It's tough city miles though.  Yeah, that's true.  How many brake jobs have you had?  I think only one.  One?  Yeah.  30 miles driving in the city?  Yeah.  30,000 miles, I mean.  Sometimes I'll go out and do gigs or whatever, but most of it.  Is your door all scratched up from Tranny's fake nails hitting the side of it?  Yeah, like two feet down from their big mules banging into the side.  Right. 
[02:07:00]  Dent in your door.  Yeah, you got a mule dent.  Hi, Daddy.  Sometimes I only crack the window so I get lipstick prints on the very top of my window.  So I won't open it because they'll put their thieving hands in.  What could I do for you, Daddy?  Their big lips.  Dance.  What are you doing, Daddy?  Oh, lipstick marks on your window.  You open the window like an inch just so they can chat into it.  Like an old lady's coffee cup.  Hey, Greg, what's up? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, Anthony, don't dismiss being with Beth so quickly because she's not going to be stretched out.  You know, because, you know, Howard doesn't have a very big one there.  All right, there you go.  At least that's what he keeps saying.  So she should be nice and tight.  He's ripping me off, my girlfriend.  Yeah.  Stop.  I invented having girlfriends, Robin.  You know, she made the worst career choice, by the way, too.  Yep. 
[02:08:00]  Because when it comes down to it, you know, Beth is, she's okay.  She's not that hot.  And FHM does this thing.  It used to be Jenna Jameson and Isaac from The Love Boat.  They give, like, sex advice.  Yeah.  And Jenna Jameson, she's blown up to the point she's not doing it anymore, so they had to get a replacement chick.  Yep.  And they got Beth to do it.  Yep.  Ugh.  Yeah, here's the problem.  Ugh.  Here's the problem with Howard.  You have that big-titted monster porn star just beyond hot, and then you got Beth who's, she's okay. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  She's nothing special.  Yeah.  You know what it is with Howard?  Whenever you align yourself with him, whenever you latch on to his coattail, you can guarantee you will never, ever be bigger than him.  He just won't allow it.  He will not allow anyone in his crew, and that includes his own girlfriend, to be bigger than him or have a career that outshines him.  Or even a moment, not even a career, because you'd have to be pretty big to outshine Howard as far as career goes. 
[02:09:00]  The guy's had a very decent career.  Jesus Christ.  But he won't even let people have their moment in the spotlight, because that's the kind of guy he is.  And that's why all his cronies who've been with him for years will never gain any higher level than they're at.  Period.  They've tried.  They've all tried.  Unless you escape.  Stutter and John escaped.  Yeah, there you go.  He escaped.  Well, Jackie escaped, but look at where that got him.  No, nowhere.  Bad move.  And who else?  Like Robin wants to do that talk show thing. 
[02:09:30]  You heard that being batted around a while?  That ain't happening.  That ain't gonna happen.  That ain't happening, and they're not really talking to her.  She took a stupid TV meeting like Aunt and I have taken.  We've taken a million of those meetings, and they're all just a go in a boardroom, you talk to some creative people.  Hey, you ever thought of doing a TV show?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  And then it goes nowhere.  We've done 10 to 12 of those, but we don't call the papers every time we do one.  She's not gonna have a fucking TV show.  What's a TV show gonna be? 
[02:10:00]  Her just sitting there in front of the camera laughing for a half hour every morning?  I'd watch that, though.  That'd be fun.  I'd tune in a couple of times and just watch it.  Oh, Howard.  Shut up.  How about Anthony and Beth?  Oh, jeez.  Great.  Good one.  You got me.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All righty.  And we'll get into some other things.  Jack-o.  Oh, we can take a break. 
[02:10:30]  We might have a better version of that Pappy song.  We don't even know if it's good or not.  Jack-o-likes kids so young.  They make the king of pop pop his spring.  And every child he fills with gin.  To see some hog by.  A toasting java log.  The creepy white-faced freak.  Likes to pretend he's nice and meek. 
[02:11:00]  But you'll get trapped inside his lair.  If you have no body hair.  Coo-coo guy.  Keeps on ducking the cops.  Spins kids around on busy rides.  Mixing them up to forget his cock.  Jack-o.  Likes kids so young.  They make him feel that he's well hung. 
[02:11:30]  Balls to be swung.  And a smooth little butt to be stunned.  But when that kid grows up, he'll say.  It might be me, but that dude is kinda gay.  Cause Jack-o likes kids so young.  Want to hear more?  Spooky man. 
[02:12:00]  It's alright.  He pretends he sleeps on a cot.  But sneaks in their beds that wacko.  Sticking it up tots in their balloon knots.  Jack-o-likes kids so young.  Want to play the rhyme game?  They make him feel their schlongs to be schlunk.  Boys to be tongued.  Some purple thing in your bone.  But when they're twelve years old, he'll say. 
[02:12:30]  We can no longer play Monster Rain.  Because Jack-o likes kids so.  He reads them porno.  Jack-o likes kids so young.  And do not tell your mama.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:13:00]  It had potential.  The organ music is great.  Yeah, the bad music is funny.  And the guys' vocals are pretty accurate.  But, I don't know, it had potential.  You know, you wanted it to work.  Yeah, well, we could start encouraging listeners to send in their Michael Jackson songs.  That was awful.  Yeah, he's not going to make it on to the next round. 
[02:13:30]  No, no, no.  You know, FHM was supposed to do a little something on old Jimmy Norton.  Really?  Really?  What happened?  I don't know if I talked to the guy or not.  I forgot.  FHM?  Yeah.  I like that magazine.  I like FHM.  Wow, we only have a half hour left in the show.  No, I'll be.  I forgot to tell people we're only doing three hours a day now.  We're lazy.  But you won't know because at 10 o'clock it'll sound like the show continues.  Oh, really? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we just played a taped segment at 10 to 11.  We're not really live.  Don't a lot of morning shows replay bits and stuff like that?  Like, I remember when I used to listen to Imus, like, I guess they covered different  listeners at 7 and 10 or whatever or whatever.  Yep.  Yeah, I was thinking about that, but with the replays we can't do that old gag anymore.  I don't think you should.  He played a million times.  Oh, Imus used to do that years ago.  I remember that.  Hey, now another Moby Worm bit we did earlier.  Here's a Moby Worm. 
[02:14:30]  And then all of a sudden he played again and again.  You don't know who Moby Worm is?  Moby Worm was a giant white worm that used to roam the streets.  Oh, jeez, this is awful.  And Imus would do, like, a blow-by-blow description of where the worm was, so, like, and he'd pick  a neighborhood off the map somewhere.  So it would be your town one day.  So it would be your town, yeah.  One day he'd be like, well, Moby Worm's working his way up the Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway 
[02:15:00]  out there on Long Island.  And now he's, oh, we're getting reports out.  Moby Worm just made a lift on Jericho Turnpike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got it.  And it's coming up to, you know, to talk at high school.  And he'd give, like, little landmarks and say Moby Worm was coming.  What was the point of Moby Worm coming to your town, though?  I have no idea.  It was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  It was for people to be, like, driving around at the intersection of, like, 135 and Jericho  Turnpike.  And having them crash because they're looking to see if there really is a giant worm following 
[02:15:30]  them.  And they'd be looking around, like, wow, I'm exactly where Imus says Moby Worm is.  Nice buzz.  Moby Worm.  There was no end to the bit.  That was it.  Yeah, it was pretty much it.  And then he'd, like, end up at a high school.  See, that's hack stuff.  At least maybe every day you give that town, you send a van out there and give them all sorts  of stuff.  Yeah.  There needs to be an ending to the bit.  No, there was no giveaway, no end.  That's all it was?  Yeah, it was just Moby Worm.  And he would tease it all morning?  Oh, he would tease it. 
[02:16:00]  He would talk about where Moby Worm was sighted.  You know, oh, he's coming out of the, you know, he's coming out of the water down there  on Fire Island.  And now he's working himself up the causeway.  And Moby Worm coming to get you, baby.  And that was pretty much it.  And then he'd play another lame song.  Wow.  And then he'd come back.  80s.  Oh, wow.  Maybe mid-80s.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did the Reverend Billisall Hargis.  We're going to replay the Hargis bit. 
[02:16:30]  That was before Rob Bartlett was there or no?  It was just about the time Bartlett came on board with him.  And Bernie?  And before Bartlett, yeah.  Yeah.  Bernie's funny, man.  Hey, is Rob Bartlett still with him or no?  I don't know.  I haven't heard of him in years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He used to be a stand-up, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was, and he would do all the impressions, I think.  Yeah.  Tyson bits and stuff, which were really funny.  Yep.  Back in the old days.  Yeah, Moby Worm coming to get you.  And then he would just destroy things and Imus would talk about it.  That was a lame-ass bit. 
[02:17:00]  Did they ever realize that Moby Worm was attached to a Herky producer?  That's why no one could find the worm.  He just put it back in his, faded into the front jeans.  We ought to do that.  Benny's Worm coming down to get you, baby.  Down 57th Street.  It's herkyin' and jerkyin'.  Look out.  Look out if you're 57th and 7.  Here comes Benny's Worm.  St. Paddy's Day is coming to the hard rock, baby.  There was, by the way, a St. Patrick's Day parade yesterday in Baltimore.  What a dumb time to have a parade.  Yesterday afternoon. 
[02:17:30]  Well, there was one in Huntington.  And then every town has their St. Paddy's Day.  New York City has it on St. Paddy's Day.  But then the rest of the towns, they do it.  A bunch of them happen over the weekend.  And another bunch will happen this coming weekend.  But why not just do it on a day?  Because people have to work.  But it'll be.  And then I guess, especially in Huntington, right?  They had the one in Huntington.  I guess they think if they had it on St. Paddy's Day,  a lot of the people from Huntington would go to the city.  Exactly.  To see it and they'd have a parade for no people.  Yeah, because the city has the Mac Daddy parade.  Oh, okay. 
[02:18:00]  And we'll be broadcasting live Thursday at the Hard Rock Cafe.  7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  Our kegs and eggs.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We haven't done one in front of a lot of listeners in a long time.  So we'll be a little rusty.  But it'll be a good time.  Anthony, I got the gerbil thing.  The gerbil story.  Oh, yes.  This is legendary.  Yeah.  This was an urban legend.  You might remember years ago.  Remember when the dittos used to make their way around the office instead of just emails?  They were little dittos would be passed around with these weird little urban legends on them. 
[02:18:30]  Now they come in emails.  But back in the old ditto days, there was one that was making the rounds.  And it was about a couple of guys that ended up in the hospital.  They were gay gentlemen.  And it was a mishap with a gerbil being up one guy's rear and the other guy trying to get the gerbil out.  Toilet paper tube.  Yeah.  With toilet paper tube involved.  A lighter.  The gerbil. 
[02:19:00]  And it was a horrible accident.  Because the guy had a lot of gas in his ass.  Yeah.  And apparently the gerbil blew out the guy's ass.  But the guy explains the whole thing in the story.  This is just one of those urban legends that is so fake and so phony yet was reported as real news.  Yeah.  It was picked up as a real news story.  And when these things made their way around the office, somebody would always go,  No, man.  I swear.  This is real.  Shut up.  Listen to this real news guy telling this ridiculous story.  Here's a fax from Cooter in Orlando who sends me a copy of a story that appeared in the Los Angeles Times. 
[02:19:30]  He says, A prestigious newspaper, not the off-maligned Weekly World News.  See, he's already selling it.  Kind of legitimizing it.  I know what you're about to hear is completely ridiculous, but it was in the LA Times, so it has to be true.  Not the off-maligned.  This isn't the Weekly World News, which we all know is filled with fake stories.  Next story, Bat Boy.  Right.  It's seen again.  Unlike your LA Times where there's nothing but real true stories.  True news.  Well, Cooter from Orlando is always a good news source. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, I know, right?  Because you should believe everything you read in your local newspaper.  That's right.  They don't exaggerate the facts at all.  They don't lie to you at all.  The Weekly World News does, but not the LA Times.  Come on.  Here's a fax from Cooter in Orlando who sends me a copy of a story that appeared in the Los Angeles Times.  He says, a prestigious newspaper, not the off-maligned Weekly World News. 
[02:20:30]  Rub-oam.  Quoting the story.  In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake, but I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil.  Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the severe burns unit of Salt Lake City Hospital.  Tomaszewski and his homosexual partner, Andrew Kinky Farnham, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong. 
[02:21:00]  What's felching?  I don't know.  After a felching.  Felching.  I believe felching.  I think I know what felching is.  All right.  Isn't it when, like, a gay guy does his thing and a gay guy's bung and then takes a straw and...  Sucks it out.  Sucks it out.  Yeah, that's supposed to be felching.  Yeah, when a guy, one guy fills the other guy's rectum with loveliness.  I don't know if you suck out your own felch.  I guess so.  What in the F would you do that ever?  I don't know. 
[02:21:30]  Let's not judge.  Because you're a gay guy and you like the man-ass and you like the jizz.  Dude, I'm getting, like, what is the thrill in that?  What is the thrill in that?  I don't know.  What's the thrill for a husband when they know that their wives will come over and have sex and they want to just go down on them after you're done banging them?  That ain't going to happen.  Oh, no, but, I mean, I've had that.  You've done that?  Yeah, with a woman who wants you to bang her, and then she goes home and tells her husband, and then he goes down on her. 
[02:22:00]  Oh!  That's a gay guy, by the way.  No, no, no.  No, it's a gay guy.  No, it's a gay guy.  I disagree.  There's nothing you're going to tell me.  I'll tell you what.  You are not going to tell me any different.  It's about the utter humiliation that she's giving him.  It's not about the guy's dick that was there.  It's about the absolute worthless cleaning utensil he's being used at as to service her and clean her vagina out.  It's not about wanting a dick in his mouth.  I don't believe.  I really think it's about being a cuckold, about just her going, you're such garbage, you're so worthless. 
[02:22:30]  Now, a real man fucked me and I'll lick this.  That's more, I think, what that's about.  Wow.  Being subservient to her.  You think that's it?  I do, yeah.  Otherwise, these women would be going, look, would you come over here and hook up with my husband?  You know what I mean?  It's not about that.  The guy obviously enjoys having man juice in his mouth.  Not necessarily.  No, I don't know if that's it, dude.  That is really creepy, Jimmy.  I think it's more, I'm not saying that can't be the case with some guys.  I'm not saying some bi or gay guys don't hide it behind threesome fantasies.  But I've talked to women who have told me some of the stuff their husband's doing. 
[02:23:00]  And to me, it's not a gay thing that they're doing.  They just want to be humiliated by a woman.  And what better humiliation as a man than to have your woman go out and fuck somebody else  and not only not lie to you about it, but say, yeah, I did.  I must say, it's humiliating.  Clean this out with your mouth.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you for summing that up.  Yeah, I don't get it either.  It's not my thing.  All right, well, back to the story.  So, a felching session went awry. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggett, our gerbil, in, he explained.  As usual, Kiki shouted out, Armageddon!  My cue, he'd had enough.  I tried to retrieve Raggett, but he wouldn't come out again, so I peered into the...  Wait, that was the safe word for the couple or something?  Yeah, yeah, if he says Armageddon, get that gerbil out of there.  Why, he doesn't want the gerbil to hear the signal? 
[02:24:00]  Why didn't he just say, pull the gerbil out?  Yeah, I know.  Take this gerbil out of my ass.  Yeah.  Ixnay on the cardboard tube A.  Let's go to Sean in Staten Island, the home of Suits.  Yeah, Suits is that out.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, ma'am.  Hey, Sean.  No, I just want to tell you guys about the finching thing.  It's not really called finching when you suck the...  He said felching.  It's called shrimping.  Oh, shrimping?  Yeah, that's what...  I don't know what finching is, but...  You're felching, you jackass. 
[02:24:30]  Felching, not finching.  Open your fucking ears, jackass.  I don't know.  Finching?  You know, whatever.  Is that something finster does?  Finching?  Finster, finster baby.  That's when you suck the come out of a bird's ass.  A little finch.  Finching.  That's a little straw you need.  Oh, look, the little coffee stirrer.  A little swizzle stick.  You have to put, like, the little twisty tie on his bird wings so he doesn't fly. 
[02:25:00]  Clip those wings, because Finchie is never enjoying this.  Sweet.  No, they never like when you finch them.  You've got to hold it down.  He tries to peck you with his little beak.  All right, so I guess this couple had a safe word.  The gerbil's up there doing its thing.  The guy can't take it anymore, so he yells Armageddon.  Armageddon.  That's what I'm thinking.  Which is a...  What?  I had a thought, and I just couldn't put it together.  As usual, Kiki shouted out, Armageddon!  My cue that he'd had enough. 
[02:25:30]  I tried to retrieve Raggett, but he wouldn't come out again, so I peered into the tube and  struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.  At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next.  The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and flame shot out the tube, igniting...  You know what the best part of this is?  Yeah.  He's believing this is a real story. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I know.  And that he found radio gold with this thing.  And that there's a press conference at this hospital about some guy that had a gerbil  shot out his ass.  The one fag yelled, Armageddon and Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler ran in and did a scene for an  awful film.  Well, Ben Affleck was dreamy in that.  Ben Affleck was in that.  Igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair.  Uh-huh.  Sorry.  Gotta just yell out bad Ben Affleck movies to get that gerbil out of there.  Come on! 
[02:26:30]  Good Will Hunting!  Good Will Hunting!  Jersey Girl!  Daredevil!  Daredevil!  Igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face.  It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers, which in turn ignited a larger pocket  of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Jesus. 
[02:27:00]  I'm getting a kick out of this.  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon!  Armageddon! 
[02:27:30]  This guy's losing his mind.  Enjoying the story much too much.  Did you guys hear about the one guy who went turtle-duving?  That's when you come all over a pear tree and a partridge sucks it out.  Fucking idiot with your phone call.  Finching.  Finching.  Finching. 
[02:28:00]  Tomaszewski suffered second-degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil.  But Furnham suffered first and second-degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.  Time again!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[02:28:30]  Oh, there you have it.  Oh, Armageddon.  That was reported as a real story many, many, many, many, many times.  Yeah, that one's pretty much been dispelled. 
[02:29:00]  You don't see that one around anymore.  But there are plenty more like it.  I'd like to see Mythbusters go after that one.  I love that show.  I watch Mythbusters all the time.  I don't know why I don't like it.  I want to like it, too.  They blow stuff up.  It's cool.  I know.  They always use a mannequin.  It just annoys me.  What are they supposed to do?  No, no, I know.  I know.  He's a real person.  I just don't know why I don't like the show.  I wish I did.  All right, why don't we take a quick break?  They had the old jumping in the elevator gag.  They did that one where somebody said if your elevator is plummeting to the basement, 
[02:29:30]  if you jump at the last minute, much like Bugs Bunny did in the plane that was crashing,  if you jump at the last minute, you'll be fine because the elevator will kind of crash around you.  And that was disproven.  Of course.  Absolutely.  You probably can't even jump.  If you can't, he's going to come up an inch.  Yeah.  Well, the thing is all relative speed.  You know, if the elevator is plummeting at, let's say, 60 miles an hour,  you have to be able to jump 60 miles an hour in order to cancel out the speed of the elevator. 
[02:30:00]  But then you would...  Obviously, you're not jumping 60 miles now.  Yeah, because then you would bang your head.  Then you'd bang your head.  Very good hope.  You wouldn't be able to jump, though, because as the elevator is going down...  You wouldn't be able to jump because it's all relative.  Relative to the inside of the elevator, your speed is zero.  So you can jump.  He knows a little bit about everything.  No, no, but I've tried to.  Going down, it's harder to jump because you're going down.  During the acceleration period, once you reach the speed that you're at, you're no longer accelerating,  and you can jump because your relative speed to the elevator is zero. 
[02:30:30]  Okay.  But your speed relative to the elevator shaft and the floor coming up at you is 80 miles an hour.  Do the math.  Do the math.  You guys, a few years ago, there was an elevator in the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  It plunged like 40 stories, but there's something called a governor on an elevator,  which would grab it and stop it from actually plunging.  But it went 40 from the 80th to the 40th floor, the 52nd to the 12th.  It plunged 40-something floors, and then the governor's finally worked  and stopped it from crashing 400-something feet, it fell. 
[02:31:00]  Did all those people get a little shorter?  No.  No, no.  They all came walking up.  Hey, how you doing?  Amazing.  How's the cartoon?  Well, did you read the headline?  In hindsight, pressing L for lobby wasn't a good idea.  All right, we've got to take a long break.  That's why Ben's in here, right?  Hi, Ben.  Why are you in here, Ben?  Do whatever you want.  Wow, do whatever we want.  Wow.  What a concept.  It's a new attitude he's got with his later hours.  Do whatever we want.  Do what you want. 
[02:31:30]  I don't care.  What do you want to do?  Ben Sparks.  What do you want to do, Ant?  We can do whatever we want.  Whatever we want.  Can we leave?  No, of course not.  Whatever we want.  Take a break.  I don't want to take a break.  I want to chit-chat with my friends.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're just true.  Chitting and chatting.  Shit.  Little chat.  Chit dash chat.  I throw out a chit, you throw out a chat.  Uh-oh.  Anthony.  What?  We might have found the first thing you're wrong about.  What's the problem?  Go ahead, Frank.  Problem?  If I could barely hear you, that would be great. 
[02:32:00]  But, Anthony, how does an elevator going down stop accelerating?  If it's continuously going down, there is no acceleration period that stops.  No, when it starts, let's say right when it starts dropping, it's going to accelerate  to whatever speed it's at, unless it hits the floor before it finishes its acceleration.  It will reach a certain speed, my friend.  It's not going to keep accelerating up to a billion miles an hour if it's got a long enough  elevator shaft.  Obviously not a billion miles an hour, but if it's going down, its continuing momentum 
[02:32:30]  will continue it to accelerate once it hits the floor.  That's when it stops.  Yeah, Anthony.  It depends on how long the shaft is.  It's going to reach whatever its terminal velocity is.  There is no terminal velocity on something continuously going down.  Yes, there is, you shithead.  There absolutely is something called terminal velocity.  I don't know.  It doesn't stop accelerating on a downward motion.  The momentum will carry it all the way down to the bottom.  That's when it stops.  Perhaps in a vacuum in space.  How about friction of the rails it's on, or the cable on the pulley, or air itself 
[02:33:00]  in the shaft?  It will reach an absolute speed and then stop accelerating.  No, it certainly won't.  It absolutely will.  You are wrong, Frank.  It's okay to make you wrong.  You are wrong, Frank.  Length times width equals area.  You are wrong, Frank.  All right, Anthony.  Yes.  Click.  He got me there because he knew he didn't have me on the other thing.  I can't believe he was challenging the beautiful line.  Don't challenge me.  I don't know who's right, but I do know that in an airless room, a feather and a brick  fall at the same speed.  Yes, they do. 
[02:33:30]  But the brick is heavier.  But Opie, no, no, no, you don't get it.  Yes.  How could a lighter thing fall like a heavy thing?  That's, well, the air.  It's more heavy than a slight thing.  I know, like, here's the thing.  When you fall, let's say you skydive, do you continue to pick up speed or is there a  speed you finally bottom out at?  No, you reach terminal velocity.  Which means that's as fast as you're going to go.  That's as fast as you are going to fall.  You can fall no faster.  That's just it.  That's the way things are. 
[02:34:00]  I just want to know why.  Because gravity doesn't shape.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just want to know why the coyote never dies when he goes over the cliff.  Very interesting, because cartoons aren't as prone to gravity as real people.  Sure it is.  He's falling like anyone else would fall.  He's always looking for the smoke.  But the weird part is, like, the bottom half of his body starts falling first, and his  head just stays in the same place.  Cartoon characters affect it very differently.  Also, if you're cartoon, you notice a ledge can fall out from under you, and you will hang  there for a while, long enough to pull a sign out that says, oh, no, on it. 
[02:34:30]  And then you'll fall, and like you said, feet first.  And the sign is made by Acme.  Acme, usually.  Acme products.  Very good.  Bullshit.  Who carries signs like that?  Stupid.  You could have, because cartoons actually have these limitless pockets in their pelt, and  they can just pull anything out of it.  But why pull out a sign when you can pull out, let's say, a parachute?  Or just yell Armageddon.  Armageddon.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt?  What's up, Fuck Nuts?  Hey. 
[02:35:00]  Well, what actually happened is if the cable broke and the elevator started accelerating  at its greatest rate of speed immediately, you would hit the ceiling because the elevator  would go down faster than you, so you wouldn't be able to jump.  And then when the elevator hit the ground, you would just smash face first.  Why would the elevator go down faster than you?  Instead of it just came to its greatest rate of speed without an increase.  It's like it's the G-forces.  When you...  You are equal.  You are exactly equal to that elevator.  You would not lift off the floor.  If you were attached to the elevator.  Exactly.  But you are falling at the same exact rate as the elevator. 
[02:35:30]  If you were attached or holding on.  No.  No.  Dropped out from under you.  You're affected by gravity the same way the elevator is.  You're falling at the exact same rate.  And since you're in the elevator, there's no wind resistance on you.  You're going to stay on the floor.  Unless the elevator is pulled down faster.  If you go to that ride in California, Disney MGM, they got the Tower of Terror.  You sit in the seat.  It's an elevator drop.  But in order to give the good illusion where you actually come off the seat, they have 
[02:36:00]  to actually pull the elevator down faster than gravity, which they do.  And you get pulled out of the seat.  If they just let it free fall, you would not come out of the seat.  You would fall at the same rate.  I think this guy was just saying, though, if there was no buildup, I think he was saying  if it automatically just went to that fastest speed possible without a buildup to it,  then you would come off the ground.  All I know is...  Like all of a sudden, if it was just going fast, fast, then all of a sudden, camera velocity,  like that, then you...  Yeah, well, in order for it to do that, it would have to be pulled out from under you  with some other force.  It can't just happen naturally.  No, no, I know.  So, yeah, then you would come off the floor if there's a motor pulling it down. 
[02:36:30]  I believe terminal velocity equals 33 FPSs.  No, no, no, no.  It's a bunch of crap that's been disproved.  Which I think is about 120 miles per hour.  Nope.  If I think about it, really.  That's quicker than that.  I don't know if I've heard that, too, but it depends on the weight, right?  Weight has to match terminal velocity.  Well, it all depends on the FPS.  So...  Yeah, well, terminal velocity through the atmosphere, through the air in the atmosphere,  is different for something like a feather, as it would be for a rock, because you get wind resistance. 
[02:37:00]  Sure.  And the air is thinner, higher.  So you're going to come faster.  Would you get a nosebleed?  I don't know.  I've always wondered why, when parachuting from, like, 30,000 feet, when you set your thing off,  why doesn't it just rip your torso in half?  Terminal velocity.  30,000 feet?  Who the hell's parachuting from 30,000 feet?  Well, I'm not off...  Well, there was one guy that did it.  Actually, I saw footage.  They were saying it might have been a log-log crash.  Well, he was in a space suit.  Yeah.  He did it from, like, 80,000 feet, just as they were testing the effects of bodies falling, 
[02:37:30]  and he had a parachute, obviously.  And he yelled Armageddon just before he jumped out of the plane.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  There's a camera mounted in the hot air balloon, and it's, like, a special one that can go up  to, like, you know, the end of the atmosphere.  And he's in a space suit, and he's outside of it, and he just drops back, and he's from,  like, the edge of space.  And you see it's like Earth from space?  Oh, yeah.  This was because they think that this is what happened in Roswell, was that these were the bodies  that they found were these test dummies they had.  I don't know if that's true or not, but they had test dummies doing this, and they actually 
[02:38:00]  had live guys.  They were aliens in Roswell.  Possible.  Possible.  I know.  They were aliens.  Well, they were small.  They could have been Mexicans.  I'm not saying they weren't.  How pompous are we to think that we're the only life form in this damn universe?  Well, let me play devil's advocate, Greg.  But they may not have said that we're the only life forms, but, again, Earth is kind  of hard to see.  There's nothing here that would be indicative of life on the planet that you'd see from  that far away.  It's hard to see clouds and water from X amount of thousands of miles.  You're not going to see it from 20 million miles. 
[02:38:30]  Why would the guy jump from 30,000 feet, though?  Wouldn't you get the same feeling from a really good blowjob?  Um, no.  Well, they're thrill seekers, right?  Oh, so you're saying he would...  Why would you go through all that when you can get the same feeling by just getting a  really nice BJ?  Because you don't have to kick the sky out of your apartment when you're finished.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the Oaday virus.  We've got to get wheelchair Fred on the phone.  Yeah, we really do.  Wheelchair Fred.  He's getting all upset. 
[02:39:00]  This guy was in a motorcycle accident years and years and years ago.  Really racked up his legs bad.  Didn't hurt his spine, so he's not paralyzed, but his legs got so messed up, he didn't have  health care coverage, so they massacred putting it back together, he ended up in a wheelchair.  Not paralyzed, but he ended up in a wheelchair.  But his legs don't work.  His legs don't work.  And his voice box got crushed, so he don't like that.  And he sounds retarded, but he's got all his wits about him.  Fred?  Yeah, you want me? 
[02:39:30]  What?  I got to tell you one thing.  In the back door, I liked it.  You liked it in the back door?  You liked it in the back door.  Yeah, but I see the light.  No more guys for me.  Oh, no more guys for you, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sick to the dildo.  And you're stuck with the dildo, right?  You guys.  I really think you need to show people out there your plight and how desperate you really 
[02:40:00]  are and what you have to do to get satisfaction.  And I think that might help your life.  How would he do that?  I'm thinking, you know, he might want to give us a little demonstration today.  Fred, why don't you roll into the bathroom and get your dildo?  No, I've got a little more class than that.  It's a little more class than that.  He took one in the ass from a guy he met at the deli.  Let us know what you're doing, Fred.  It's all lubed up.  It's all lubed up. 
[02:40:30]  All right, Fred.  Well, you know what to do with it now.  So go ahead.  Explain what you're doing, Fred.  Well, we're cutting up my butt now.  You got it up there, Fred?  Yeah.  How's that feel?  It's interesting.  I've met.  He has, his voice changed.  His voice changed.  Your voice got higher, Fred.  What happened?  I'm going to hide your string now.  His voice got higher. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  This is horrible.  We'll do the silent game to him.  So, Fred, how's it going in there?  Oh, marvelous.  I'm picking up speed, nice and fast.  Make it count.  Oh, mercy, I've got nothing to lose. 
[02:41:30]  I need a girl from a bitch for me.  Are you there?  Are you guys there?  For God's sake, say something.  Well, let's go.  I need to get out. 
[02:42:00]  It's awful shit.  So, ladies, come on down and do me.  For God's sake, do me.  Okay, I don't know what I've heard you guys are.  Ladies, I'm going to go now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  Anybody else have a hard on?  Oh, man.  A.B. and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  XM 202.  The A.B. and Anthony Show.  Wow, this show flew by today, man. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Getting ready to play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  Very educational program.  Very educational.  We'll go to the phones and read your instant feedback in just a few minutes.  Science!  Something that you learned today, please give us a call.  Hey, thanks, Anthony, from Morristown, who works at the place that may help my vehicle.  You're a fine man.  Ooh.  All right.  Before we get into what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony program today, yes, we want 
[02:43:30]  to debut a brand new promo from Steve, from Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  He came up with another concept promo.  He did.  Can we do the, hey, I can't hear you guys promo?  I can barely hear you guys, by the way.  Hard to hear us.  Hey, man, I can't hear you.  Yeah.  I can barely hear you.  The listeners for the last five months off and on have been saying, I can't hear you.  I can barely hear you.  To the tool in Washington who doesn't think that I know how to run the equipment. 
[02:44:00]  Fix the dick and dick and dick and dick and dick and dick and dick and dick and dick.  Nice.  Wow, that's angry.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  Or that stupid XM, the stinger they do.  Pew, pew, pew.  Oh, whatever it is.  That's terrible.  This is horrible.  What is it?  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  The worst piece of music.  They want us to, they want all our promos to end with that.  They love that thing.  They love that thing.  Well, how does it go?  They love it. 
[02:44:30]  Be, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  It's depressing and horrendous and it's never being on the show.  Isn't it depressing?  It's awful.  Why is it depressing?  Because it's terrible.  Where is it?  Well, it's because there's a bunch of programming geniuses that work at XS.  Well, it is.  They know better than us.  Oh, and I hear...  Ah, what the hell is that?  Those are logos.  Well, Eric, where's the thing?  Yeah, where's the one we wanted?  Hawk!  Let's hear that. 
[02:45:00]  Just hit it.  Just hit it.  Hit it, sweetie.  Wow, Eric, you're usually good,  but you just failed miserably.  You stink on ice over here.  Eric!  You failed miserably trying to find what I want.  Hawk!  Hawk, find what Opie wants.  I ain't going to be that one.  That's ten seconds long.  This thing is only a two-second little stink thing.  Hawk.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  XM 202.  Mar, mar, mar.  All right, let's go to the phones and play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  Let's say hi to Curtis.  Curtis, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Great to have you back.  Hey, Curtis.  How you doing? 
[02:45:30]  I'm doing great, sweet cheeks.  Thank you very much, gentlemen.  I learned that, you know,  even bilateral wheelchair people can even take it up the ass.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, they replayed that today?  Cool.  Yeah, that was freaking hilarious.  I work on a wheelchair, man,  and I take all the retards around,  and, you know, that was absolutely hilarious.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Thanks, John.  Thank you.  Great to have you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let's go to Mike in Maryland,  and Mike, what did you learn on the program today?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hi, man.  Jimmy, just want to let you know you killed in Baltimore.  Oh, thanks.  You're great.  Thanks for signing my CD. 
[02:46:00]  Thanks for coming.  And I learned what felching was.  What's felching?  What is that?  Oh, he doesn't know, though.  Ooh, he lied.  All right, let's go to Rick in Boston.  Rick, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  What's up, guys?  I learned that finching is when you suck,  come out of a bird's ass.  Finching, yes.  We did learn that.  Finching.  Yeah, that's funny.  It could also be if you come in Atticus's backside.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  That's right.  Finching.  And you suck it out while he's defending a black gentleman.  Very good.  All right.  Punch it out.  What an education we got.  Yes.  Doughboy from Wagbag.com.  He learned Anthony has a fat Italian hog and that I'm being strong-armed by the mob.  Uh-huh.  Why not?  Oh.  Just mentioned a few places that I liked.  Enough with the plugs.  Uh, Mormon from Jordan.  Mormon from Jordan.  Jesus.  Mormon Jordan from Utah.  I learned Opie would rather have ass cancer. 
[02:47:00]  That's not what I said.  That's what Brother Weed said.  Tony.  Uh, you should go to Dr. Kennedy.  He's good.  Let's, uh, say hi to Waldo.  Waldo, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  Where are you?  Yeah, I'm actually in Philadelphia, gentlemen.  All right.  Oh, well, there he is.  What's going on down there?  Found him.  It's a little cold.  All right.  Anyways, I learned today that Jim Norton is a little overweight, just a tad.  Did we really learn that?  Yeah, well, I went to Eatabullet.com and I saw his picture and I was like, wow, he could 
[02:47:30]  use a little weight loss, but.  I know.  Just plug the website.  There's a little backhanded compliment there.  Thank you, fella.  Waldo, why are you worried about how other guys look?  What's going on?  Really?  I'm going to be honest with you.  I think he has some potential.  If you look at his face, he's got some nice facial features.  His cheekbones are nice and solid.  I mean, I think he can't some potential.  You're looking a little too closely at our little Jimmy.  I say let this gentleman finish.  Go right ahead, sir.  I like him with the long locks that he's wearing today, though.  What's going on in Philly? 
[02:48:00]  Going on.  He gets a little makeover, put a little hair in there, a little gel, you know, run a mile  or two a day.  He's good.  He's good.  You know how awful I'd look with spiked hair, gelled hair?  Ooh.  Like a fool.  All right.  Like a fool.  Let's go to Rich in Philly.  Rich, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony program today?  Yo, guys, I learned that the body is on the tube of space.  Oh, yes.  We did learn that today.  Very good.  All right.  I want to remind people that this coming Thursday, Anthony, we'll be broadcasting live 
[02:48:30]  at the Hard Rock Cafe for St. Paddy's Day, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  It's called Kegs and Eggs.  Hoping everyone gets there this Thursday at the Hard Rock Cafe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Hit me.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:49:00]  The O-N-A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Anthony, when we were off on hiatus, I've got to tell you, I was traveling around the country  with a lot of these comedians and stuff.  And, you know, I followed Jim Norton on tour a little bit.  And I've got to tell you what happened.  I don't even think Jimmy knows what I'm about to talk about here.  I was at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Oh, yeah.  I missed that one.  And a lot of the guys we know and love were up there.  It was me and Rich Voss and a few other guys. 
[02:49:30]  And, you know, Jimmy's like, I'm going to do this one show.  So I'm like, yeah, I'll check it out, you know.  So we go over there and I'm in the audience.  And all of a sudden it was something where, I don't know, comedians were not only doing  their comedy, they were doing, like, confessions.  Like they were doing, like, confessions or whatever.  Yeah.  Like weird stories that happened to them while growing up and stuff.  But they made it funny, you know.  And, you know, most of the stories were kind of cute and stuff, whatever.  And Jimmy gets up there and he starts telling the story about something that happened to 
[02:50:00]  him when he was a kid.  Yeah.  And what's wrong?  Nothing.  Oh.  And all of a sudden, Jimmy starts telling the story when he was a kid that he used to  play this game.  Yeah.  This game called Monster Rain.  I never heard about this.  Yeah.  It's a little game.  What is Monster Rain?  Do you want to explain it or do you want me to explain what I saw?  I'll explain it.  Dude, it was the greatest thing, you know, the greatest thing that happened while we were 
[02:50:30]  off the air for two years.  For Revelation?  Well, I don't know.  You know, so I'm sitting in the audience and Jim proceeds to tell the story that when  he was a little kid, he would go under the porch when it rained with all the little boys  in the neighborhood.  Right?  Yeah.  And the storm would be coming and the rain clouds and things like that.  And I guess Jimmy would yell Monster Rain and that was the cue for everyone to run under  the porch or in this case him and his little friend.  Yeah.  And then they would proceed to blow each other under the porch.  Get out of here. 
[02:51:00]  Well, when Monster Rain is coming, the only thing you can do, I guess, is hide under a  porch and take a little bald peenie in your mouth.  It tends to protect you from the rains.  You would have oral sex with little kids under the porch.  I didn't play this two weeks ago.  I played it when I was five and they were five.  So, I understand, but why was it called Monster Rain?  I don't know.  I guess we couldn't confront the fact that we were engaging in homosexual behavior at  that age.  So, I would yell Monster Rain and that was just, look in hindsight, I realized it was 
[02:51:30]  just an excuse to get under the porch.  An umbrella would have been more prudent.  So, I'm sitting there in Montreal at the show.  Confessing it, by the way.  Jeff Singer's show, Confessing It.  Oh, Confessing It.  And Jimmy's telling the story and I'm thinking, I know eventually you and I are going to be  back on the radio.  And sure enough, we are here at XM Satellite Radio.  It's getting more gooder every day.  Right.  I think we're up to like our 20th broadcast or something like that.  And all of a sudden I yelled to the waitress, get me a pen. 
[02:52:00]  And I wrote it on my hand to remind myself I did not want to forget this one.  And when we got back to New York, I wrote in my little book of things we were going to  eventually do on the show.  So, there you have it.  Yeah.  A little embarrassing.  Yeah, that sounds like...  Jim's Monster Rain story.  And he told me, he's like, I will remember that.  And I don't even remember how long ago this was, but it's a while ago.  I mean, it's got to be 15 months ago, something like that.  It was like last summer, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, there's no way he's going to remember that. 
[02:52:30]  And you certainly did.  And you take him under the porch.  And then what would you say to each other after it's done?  Wouldn't it be a little awkward or weird?  I don't remember, actually.  I'm sure there was a lot of avoided eye contact, especially when we walked outside.  There was dry grass.  And there was dirt with no mud on it.  No rain at all.  Yeah, we realized we'd been bamboozled again to sucking each other's penises.  Is that the secret story you've heard?  That's pretty twisted, man.  That's Jimmy.  I told that and confessing it.  I felt you had to tell a true story.  That was embarrassing. 
[02:53:00]  And that was both.  Monstering.  By the way, I'm sitting here and I'm wondering when the F are they going to get to our office?  Actually.  We got here in New York and they said they were going to give us an office.  And they started building it a couple weeks ago.  But they haven't been here in weeks.  Don't get it done.  So we have to hang out in the studio to prepare for the show.  Then we do the show.  Then we do meetings in the studio.  If you want something a little more pertinent to bitch about, enough with the Carlin bits.  All right?  If I have to hear another goddamn George Carlin bit when we go to commercial break, I'm going to shoot myself. 
[02:53:30]  Enough.  Do we have other comics we can play aside from George Carlin?  I've heard that.  What was it?  The House of Blues one?  8,000 times.  Enough.  I never thought I could get sick of hearing a Carlin bit, ever.  Ever.  I know.  But now, how many times?  There's got to be other stuff.  We have other comedians loaded on that thing, don't we?  How come it's always the stupid Carlin bit?  I don't get it.  They explain that we have to throw this stuff into the computer like two weeks in advance. 
[02:54:00]  I don't know.  So supposedly they're going to get more comedians involved in the whole thing and more variety.  But we're stuck with the George Carlin bits.  We're stuck with no office still.  This is our 20th show.  And we thought, you know, we would have everything set up.  It'd be nice to get done with the show and be able to go to an office instead of hanging  out in here for another hour after the show is done.  I don't care where we sit.  As long as Tuesday night, game one starting, American League Championship, and the Yankees  are going to smack the fucking Red Sox right in the face. 
[02:54:30]  Absolutely.  Oh, here's Ben now.  Sure.  Jackass.  Nice.  Then what do you think of your Sox chances this year?  Shoking jizz bags is what they are.  Yeah, we'll always blow it.  We always blow it.  We always blow it.  That's true.  I'm glad you're very familiar with the situation.  It's all about the Pats.  You're a well-trained Boston Red Sox fan.  Pats.  A little early.  Yeah, that's all right.  Pats, my friend.  Yeah.  What do they have?  Two in a row?  There's no way.  Absolutely not.  They're finished.  All right, Anthony.  Yep.  In honor of the Monster Rain story that Jimmy just told, I got a song. 
[02:55:00]  Ooh.  I got a Monster Rain song.  Already.  Wow.  That was quick.  Certainly was.  Who did this one?  Who's chemistry?  That's quick.  Who the hell's chemistry?  He came out with that one.  Already?  Already?  Yeah.  You told this story five seconds ago.  Wow.  Chemistry from Whack Bag has a Monster Rain song already? 
[02:55:30]  That was, Jesus, quick.  I really love that Whack Bag, man.  They've supported us.  Absolutely.  Unbelievable.  I mean, I go on there every night, and no one complains about the show ever.  Yeah.  They're just so psyched to have us back.  Yep.  It's great.  We had to take two years off, so they really, really appreciate what we do on a daily basis.  And it's just been a pleasure to go to WhackBag.com after every show and just read the appreciation threads.  And they're just loving the new show.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Even though it's a work in progress, we've still got a lot to do to get it in shape, you know?  Right, right.  I wish someday they would get us off this stupid premium crap.  I think it's a joke that we're even on the premium.  Yeah, well, I don't see that happening.  I don't really care.  We can do whatever we want here.  It's fine.  Yeah.  If we come off, we're going to have to tone down the show.  There's no way we're going to do that.  I just can't take the hours.  But we've got an audience that's the size of, I don't know, like a college radio station, you know?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  It'd be nice to actually talk to a lot of people.  And I think this premium channel crap is really holding us back. 
[02:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  But they're not even listening in Washington at all.  They just will not listen to what we're saying.  I don't see us ever getting off of this premium.  But anyway, so this guy, Chemistry, from, I guess, Whack Bag, has a Monster Rain song?  Already, yeah.  It's called Jimmy Says.  Huh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[02:57:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah, I said it, crawl under the porch.  The Monster Rain's coming, the sky's gray, my pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house. 
[02:57:30]  Y'all know the game.  Monster fucking rain, it ain't a damn thing.  Change.  You're all under the porch, your friend fellates you.  Crawl under as two digits masturbate you.  I alleviate the stress with a cock caress.  I explode on my friend's neck with a monster mess.  Just two little toys, no need for vagalube.  Suck on a little clock toward a slight lack of pubes.  We gotta keep it quiet, make sure mom don't find out.  I'll finish you off quick so I can pull mine out.  It's just a little pleasure with a lot of shame.  Who cares?  I gotta blame it all on the Monster Rain. 
[02:58:00]  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Pull, pull.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Pull, pull.  Yeah, I said it, crawl under the porch.  The Monster Rain's coming, the sky's gray, my pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Jimmy Norton, get your cock out.  Jimmy Robinson, get your cock out.  Willie D'Angelo, get your cock out. 
[02:58:30]  Everybody, get your cock out.  Hey, that's not bad, huh?  That's pretty funny.  And fast.  That is pretty funny.  Chemistry from whackbag.com with a Monster Rain song.  We were just talking about that story that Jimmy told up there in Montreal.  And Chemistry was up there in Montreal, saw Jimmy's act,  and thought he'd write that song.  That's pretty clever.  Yeah.  You know, we get to use it.  Now we get to use it and play it on the show.  Yeah, I notice you're playing with these really, really cheap poker chips 
[02:59:00]  that someone sent in.  Why don't someone send in some good poker chips?  These are the cheap little plastic ones.  Right.  Look, they're in a round little case.  And they don't look like the Vegas chips.  They're red.  No.  You got red, white, and blue.  Yeah, red, white, and blue.  Ugh.  Ooh.  Listen to this.  Listen.  They don't even sound heavy or anything.  Those are awful.  They're just brutal.  Yeah.  What are we going to do with these poker chips?  I don't know.  No.  Hey, Ben, just throw it to the side here. 
[02:59:30]  Just put it in front of me.  Yeah.  Can you grab Noah, please?  By the way, when is that girl coming in with the lesbian couch  as we rebuild the Opie and Anthony program?  Yes, we need a lesbian couch.  Remember that girl?  I forgot where she's from.  I think up near somewhere in New England.  She's coming down with the lesbian couch.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  I think this is the second time we're supposed to have somebody bring a couch.  And they've not come, so I'm not holding my breath.  Well, I can't wait to get the lesbian couch back into the Opie and Anthony studio.  Then we can start inviting the girls to come down. 
[03:00:00]  I wonder if somebody around here is going to complain that a couch is being brought in.  Yeah.  Complains about everything else we do.  Oompa Loompa.  Yeah.  Jeez, enough.  The miserable old guy downstairs that freaking lets us in in the morning.  Oh, he's the worst.  Yeah.  Oh.  I hate that guy.  Yeah.  What a curmudgeon.  Fat's always asleep.  Looks like Pat Cooper.  Well, last week we got the Jägermeister machine, so we're getting the place back in order here.  Psyched.  Got the Jägermeister machine.  We'll get the lesbian couch. 
[03:00:30]  I think it's next week, hopefully.  I don't drink.  Huh?  I know you don't drink, but it's great for the show, though.  It listens everybody up before they come on the air with us, so, you know.  Yeah.  All right.  Psyched about Halloween?  Not really.  Coming up.  I'm a little psyched.  What?  Me and my chick.  I don't know.  We're, like, psyched about buying some candy and, you know, new neighborhoods, so we used  to live in an apartment, so it's going to be nice living in a house to have kids come  around and knock on the door and, you know, giving out their Halloween candy.  Yeah, but now that you're living out on Long Island?  Yeah.  You just moved out there, what, a few weeks ago? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  I'm trying to think?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Just the last month.  You're going to have to get the good candy now.  Yeah.  You're in the neighborhood.  I'm not going to get those little ones.  I'm going to get the full-size candy bars.  Because when you used to live in Brooklyn, you know, no one was really coming to your  door for candy.  No one came to the door in Brooklyn.  But now you're going to have to be Mr. Halloween Guy this year.  That's what I'm looking forward to.  It's part of suburban living that I'm actually very excited about.  Hand the candy out to the little.  We're looking at the little costumes coming to the door.  Trick or treat.  And I'll give them full-size candy bars. 
[03:01:30]  It'll be all nice.  Nice neighborhood, so I don't have to worry about riffraff or nothing.  It's going to be nice.  Are you going to dress up this year?  Anthony always dresses up for Halloween.  I don't always dress up.  Occasionally, if we go to Halloween parties, I'm going to dress up because it's a party.  You dressed up as, what was it, a pirate or something?  I wasn't a pirate.  I was some type of renaissance gentleman.  Renaissance faggot.  I had a sword and a frilly shirt.  And it's one of these guys that still dresses up for Halloween.  Only if I'm going to Halloween parties.  I refuse to dress up.  And I had it laying around. 
[03:02:00]  And I will not be dressing up this Halloween again.  I'll do it for the kids.  Like, I'll spray my mule nice and blue and then tell them it's cotton candy.  Very nice.  I'd turn all the lights off and hide because they're ringing the bell and I'm too cheap to get candy.  Now, you used to have to do that if you ran out of candy.  Yeah.  You would hide and have to live like you're a hostage in your own house.  Right, right, right.  But now, no, I'm very psyched.  You know, it's going to be kind of a new thing, living in the suburbs. 
[03:02:30]  And I'm kind of excited about it.  Unlike an apartment building where, you know, you knock on the door, you think it's a kid trick-or-treat,  and all of a sudden it's home invasion time.  Right, right, right.  There goes your computer, television.  You're left tied up and raped.  Fort Dominicans with, like they're wearing pillowcases over their heads and they have hammers.  Dude, we've been promising for the last three or four days this drill-do bit.  We've got to finally play.  All right.  We've got to finally play it. 
[03:03:00]  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  This came in.  I don't even know if it's going to sound good or whatever, but basically this guy, how's  the story go?  He had a drill.  He put a dildo on the end of it.  A dildo on the end of a drill.  And I guess he used it on his chick.  Right.  And he taped the whole thing.  He's like a faithful listener to the show.  Some guy named Robification.  Oh, I think that guy's on Whackbag.  Yeah.  Another guy from whackbag.com.  Robification.  Uh-huh.  Or Robification, something like that. 
[03:03:30]  What is his name?  How do you spell it?  R-O-B-I.  That would be Robification.  Robification?  R-O-B-E.  It would be Robification.  These early hours are killing me.  I can't speak right.  I'm not sleeping.  What are you complaining?  I just stand up at night.  I get up at 5.11 this morning and I get to bed at like 1.30.  Getting up every morning at 3.30 a.m. is just killing me.  It's hard to get used to.  It's absolutely killing me.  I can't focus.  Having a tough time, you know, pronouncing these big words.  Oh, sweetie.  Afternoons ruled.  But anyway, so Robification or Robification, whatever the hell his name is. 
[03:04:00]  He used this drill dough thing on his chick and we got the audio.  Steve says it's amazing.  Yes, it's a.  Anyone else notice about Steve?  I'm starting to notice a weird pattern about him.  Yeah.  I might be going out on a limb, but anyone else noticing that he's starting to wear clothes  that have like flames on it?  He's been doing that for a little while now.  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Because I remember him, you know, when we were working at WNAW, he would just wear like  concert shirts and stuff.  Yeah, concert tees, any kind of like hard rock bands on his shirt.  But now he's going for this flame thing.  Flame thing.  But it's very kind of subtle.  It's like maybe once, twice a week, all of a sudden he comes in with something that looks  kind of flamey.  Yeah, like a shirt.  Yeah.  Or he'll come in with a hat with some flames on it or something.  I think it's his look.  I think he's going for a look.  I don't know what it is, but.  I'll tell you what it is.  It's Chelsea. 
[03:05:00]  I don't know.  Stupid fruit.  But I noticed something that's going on with him.  Yeah.  Definitely something's going on with him.  The reason I like wearing flames is to keep me warm.  What?  Flaming Steve.  Flaming Steve.  Hmm.  I smell promo.  Flaming Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  Anyway, speaking of Steve, the sweepers.  What the, what is wrong with them?  They're all, you know. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, they're, yeah, yeah.  The woman, the violence against women sweepers.  They're all making us look, you and I look gay.  Yep.  Gay and beat up women.  And beat up women.  That's pretty much it.  It's the only sweepers we get.  I think he has issues with women or something.  Oh, I thought you were actually saying that he should, like, encourage him.  Good job.  Job well done.  More women hating promos.  Right.  That's the weirdest thing, though.  It's like, that's all he has is two forms of promos.  The gay promos for you and I, and, you know, promos about women get beat up. 
[03:06:00]  You heard the one about the boss and stuff.  Yep.  What the F?  Dude, you know, when am I going to get an Insta-replay?  I don't, I don't like the, I don't like the fact that only you get to play the sound effects.  You don't get one.  All right.  Well, we got to play this drill dough bit.  Supposedly, it's really good.  Steve, that's, oh, that's where we're going.  Steve says, uh, this is really, really good.  All right.  Really good audio.  He was taping his chick as he was using this drill dough on her.  Excuse me.  Let's take a listen to this, and we'll be back with the opening it. 
[03:06:30]  What?  Ah, he got you.  Shit.  Here's the drill dough bit.  Maybe not.  Maybe if some of this freaking equipment will work around here.  Are you kidding?  Again?  Hit the button, sweetie.  Yeah, that's the problem with the new studio.  I swear to God, this is driving me absolutely fucking nuts.  By the way, that intern is a fag.  I'm sorry.  He's too handsome to not be. 
[03:07:00]  When is DC going to fix the fucking studio?  Language, young man.  Easy.  There we go.  All right, let's try it again.  Because you don't need timing and comedy or anything.  No, no, of course not.  Let's hope not.  Oh, God.  Here, I want the drill.  Oh, please.  Should I tie it on?  Here.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I want the whole thing.  Oh, God. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What did I just do to you?  Treating me like a whore.  How did I do that? 
[03:08:00]  By using the trail on me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh fuck yeah  Oh fuck me with this  Oh yeah  Oh my god  Oh  Oh my god  Oh fuck me  Oh  Oh my god  Yeah 
[03:08:30]  Oh fuck yeah  Oh yeah  Oh fuck  Oh  Oh fuck yeah  Oh god  Oh my god  Oh my god  Don't stop treating me like a whore  Please  Oh my god

[03:18:30]  and I threw all  the poker chips  at her  yeah but didn't  you remember  she brought  the poker chips  I know  I know  yeah put the  poker chips  she's gonna bring  over there  so when she comes  we can throw it  at her  well your acting  was so good  you should have  said I hate  these chips  hope someone  brings them  today  I didn't think  you know  people were gonna  study everything  wait okay  they gotta be  you know  this has to be  live because  they just blew  the poker chip  thing because  she did bring  them in  and I didn't  think people  know the show  that deeply  that was the  beauty of that  and hey  I love when you  said Steve  is wearing  some flame  stuff once  or twice  a week  once or twice 
[03:19:00]  yeah  I mean it's  starting to be  like a thing  I don't know  I'm noticing  a pattern  perhaps in a  couple of months  it will be  a big thing  not gonna make  fun of it yet  because we don't  know what it's  about  it's just very  rare  it's amazing  I even noticed  it  have you guys  noticed that  as well as a lot  of other things  that might cover  a month coming  up in 30 minutes  Chad from LA  what's up  oh we just lost  him  he waited too long  alright why don't  we take a break 
[03:19:30]  we've been having  fun with the  Jay Leno monologues  we have another one  we were backed  up a little bit  oh cool  this is when  Jay Leno  finally was able  to you know  go back to  telling jokes  full time  because he was  having everyone  else fill in  for him a little  bit  because of the  court order  the gag order  whatever  so here's  Jay Leno  Michael Jackson  jokes and then  we'll come back  and do one more  segment for you guys  today  new hours  7am to 11am  on the east coast  for the Opinette  program  the judge has  he lifted the gag order  we had a gag order  we couldn't do  any Michael Jackson  jokes  in fact  I was quite honest  today he cited  a line in the 
[03:20:00]  constitution  in my defense  show the constitution  look at this  see that  no  congress will make  no law  forbidding a man  with a big chin  from telling jokes  now the gag order  is lifted  I can finally say  what I have not  been allowed to say  all this time  Michael Jackson  is my father  as you know  yesterday 
[03:20:30]  Michael showed up  at the courthouse  late  or as he likes  to call it  a little behind  actually  actually  when Michael  finally did arrive  he was looking  disheveled  wearing pajama bottoms  and walking stiffly  which is how most  boys usually leave  Neverland Ranch  save your applause  as a million of these  I mean come on  isn't that strange  showing up to court  wearing pajama bottoms  and a t-shirt 
[03:21:00]  I mean is that  really a smart move  you're being accused  of child molestation  you're sitting there  wearing your  granimals  I don't think so  in fact the worst part  was when the kids  saw the pajama bottoms  and said  hey those are mine  you know what  see I think  Michael got confused  I think he saw  all the kids  waiting to testify  and figured  oh this is some  kind of sleepover  I must have  missed out  but there was  no court today  no  no the jury  the jury  they had today off  actually they were  given three days  so their skin 
[03:21:30]  could stop crawling  that's basically  what they do  they'd come back  on Monday  see a lot of people  thought Michael  was faking it yesterday  they did  but people know  Michael says  he does have back  problems that flare up  from time to time  like when he's on  trial for child  molestation  when you hear about  this suicide  a lot of people  think Michael  may be suicidal  that's the latest  theory  in fact last night  he swallowed  an entire bottle  of Flintstones  chewables  did you hear the testimony 
[03:22:00]  it was pretty graphic  it's pretty creepy  the prosecution  said Michael  is very manipulative  like according to  accuses testimony  Michael Jackson  told him  masturbation  was important  and Michael  told him  this is actually  what Charlie  said he once  knew a boy  who didn't masturbate  and the kid  wound up having  sex with a dog  and today  Prince Charles  said hey  leave my wife  out of this  learn to play  poker  with the  Opie and  Anthony show  no 
[03:22:30]  oh god  he spilled  my shit  I'm sorry sir  Opie  now clean it up  that's right  be a poker player  just like your father  the Opie  and Anthony show  are you happy  now Opie  are you happy  XM202  I'd rather die  to give you control 
[03:23:00]  bow down  before the one  you serve  you're going  to get  what you deserve  bow down  before the one  you serve  you're going  to get  what you deserve 
[03:23:30]  hey Todd  what's going on  today buddy  good morning boys  how you doing  good what's up  good morning  fucking wasp  hi  I want to let  you guys know  how bad  you fucking  got me  first of all  you gotta understand  that I've been  listening to you  every single day  driving a truck  over the road  since you guys  came to XM Radio  because I spent  so many hours  out on the road  there's quite a few  days where I  listened to you guys  two or three times  and I was so  pissed off  that I actually  ended up calling  the FU line 
[03:24:00]  and cussing you  guys out  on the FU line  you guys got me  so damn bad  wow we actually  got someone  I'm sitting there  yelling that you  guys need to get  your asses back  on the air  the dang fair  and what not  this is probably  one of the best  shows you guys  have ever done  just because of  that stuff  it was alright  I don't know  I hope I think  that our acting  was a little better  than you think  it was  my acting  was really good  in the beginning  because I made  my voice sound  really tired  I came out  of the break  going like  hey  I just low keyed it  to me  I gotta tell you 
[03:24:30]  this is the first day  doing the new hour  7am to 11am  east coast time  I feel like a different  person already  I really do  this is going to  help me tremendously  feel like a new man  a new man  but Anthony thinks  it's all relative  and eventually  we'll just fall  into the same crap  absolutely  the only thing  that isn't relative  is if we were on  from 3 to 7  afternoon drive  what an easy day  that was  oh it's noon  hey guys  I can't really hear you  so I'll just start talking  alright  yeah you guys 
[03:25:00]  almost had me at first  but then  I started looking at  my phone  it says  Opie and Anthony live  so I'm starting to realize  yeah this has got to be  total bullshit  yeah I guess  the little  whatever they put  on the MiFi  the display  the display  it changes  if we're in best of  and you know what  I missed the first week  of the show  like when you first  when you guys  first came out  so you guys  started talking  about Monster Rain  so I'm thinking  okay this must be  best of  and I'm still  looking at the screen  it still says  Opie and Anthony live  so I'm just waiting  for you guys  to come back on  but you know what 
[03:25:30]  Opie did  he told the Monster Rain  story when the reality  was he mentioned  Monster Rain  and I actually told it  yeah Jimmy told the story  and believe me  I hope he told it  better than it was  told this time  because that was  an awful  reaction to that story  he's Opie's just like  they would yell  Monster Rain  under the porch  and blow each other  correct or wrong  right or wrong Jim  right or wrong  yep that's affirmative  yep I confirm  but we were trying  to make it a gag  you know what I mean  we weren't trying  to be that believable  that's not true  I'm a good actor  Tony what's up  Tony  hello 
[03:26:00]  what's up  hello  what's up  yeah  alright he's out  he said he was full  let's go to Bill  the trucker  Bill what's up  you guys got me  hook line and sinker  and I'm even thinking  that when I called in  and somebody answered  the phone  they said  we're not here right now  anyone  what if you want  to leave a message  and I pressed one  and it's like  oh I must have  got the recording  anyone that uses  the phrase  hook line and sinker  should be gotten  that's right  hook line and sinker  the only one I want  to hear using that  is Scott Peterson  alright 
[03:26:30]  before we do  get out of here  we gotta talk  about this  Lady Joanna  whose head  was found  in a bowling bag  nice  this story  happened over  the weekend  the New York  Post is reporting  and it's just  unbelievable  she wouldn't  stop a yapping  yapping  the battle  of bowling  sleigh pair  yeah  a tightwad  husband charged  with hiding  his spouse's  hacked off head  in a bowling ball 
[03:27:00]  bag and stashing  her body parts  in the walls  of their home  may  it says  may have snapped  may have snapped  may have snapped  during a fight  over renovating  their house  renovating their house  but see  no  this is called  the last straw  how could you  still not be sure  if the guy snapped  or not though  oh he snapped  using the word  he may have snapped  he snapped  oh no he snapped  right  Ron  snapped  Ron Savino  allegedly broke down  and confessed to cops  Friday that he killed  his wife Joanna  better known as 
[03:27:30]  Pixie  after she threatened  to leave him  over his refusal  to revamp their home  Pixie  see  she just wanted  a little home  improvement  Anthony  she wanted a home  improvement  he's like  get away from me  shut up  and she just kept  I'm gonna leave ya  and he goes  you know what  cut your fucking head off  oh no you're not  neighbors said  that Joanna  who was missing  since January 17th  was always nagging 
[03:28:00]  the husband  to fix up their  dilapidated  Jersey City home  which had no heat  and only a hot plate  for cooking  nagging  wow really  she was a very clean  person and it bothered her  she didn't want to live  like that  he was tight with his money  they used to fight  a lot about money  he was a mean  weird kind of guy  she was going to leave  him after Christmas  I hear she was really  pissed off  because they went out  to LA once  and he rented  this real cheap  rental car  and she wanted  to rent the Mercedes  but uh 
[03:28:30]  and I hear just  she was yapping  about that  and he was like  shut up  well sure  perhaps  well what kind of car  did he get  some Nissan  or something  some real  crappy rental car  sensible  a sensible rental  sensible rental  and she was pissed at it  and they call him  a tightwad  in that story  oh very funny  uh 
[03:29:00]  he was a mean  weird kind of guy  she was going to  leave him after Christmas  Savino told friends  that his wife  had gone to  New Mexico  or Florida  because she preferred  warm climates  because now  the neighbors are like  hey where's your wife  the skinflint  suspect  skinflint  what year is this  warehouse worker  damn pinch penny  plastered the neighborhood  with missing person flyers  ah that old gag  the crime was exposed  after cops went to the house  and found  the victim  sawed off head  and limbs 
[03:29:30]  damn it  why didn't I have that  sound effect ready  he said  well you know  we don't have to  freeze his whole body  we can freeze his head  oh  that's horrifying  they found her head  where did they find it  in a bowling ball bag  in a bowling ball bag  he hid the rest of her body  in the walls of the house  yeah  why did he save the head  I wonder  he could just like  look and say  I told you to shut up 
[03:30:00]  like every so often  just yell at her  that's a good point  you hide the rest of the body  in the walls of the house  but you save the head  in a bowling ball bag  why do you save the head  in a bowling ball bag  guaranteed he was  looking into it  every so often  and going  I told you you bitch  Edmund Kemper  who was the co-ed  killer in California  who eventually  murdered his mother  would talk to his mother  with a fucking skull  in the bowling bag  he killed some chick  and he cut her head  and put her in a bowling bag  something weird  anti-social about that  a little bit  like beyond just the killing  just want to remind people  it all started  with a nice wedding somewhere 
[03:30:30]  oh yeah  I'm sure  these two got married  it was nice  this is a nice ongoing bit  we like to do on the program  this started out  as a nice little wedding  I'm sure both families  were very happy that day  and  how old were they  uh  it doesn't really say  I read somewhere  he was in his 60s  yeah  alright  if they're  she looks a little bit  on the  older couple  like yeah  sure why not  so  and they were together  for a while  right  and just  he couldn't take it  he snapped  her head had to go  in that bowling bag  what a mess 
[03:31:00]  that's gotta be  god  hacking up a person  gotta just make the scene  really messy  and then on the  do that  then on the same page  in the paper  longest divorce  in state history  is finally over  Anthony  yep  they've been at war  for 21  years  can you imagine  going through a 21 year  divorce  mine took  I think  3 years  3 years  and that seemed like  an eternity  of hell  it was a nightmare  for 3 friggin years 
[03:31:30]  21 years  it has raged  for more than  21 years  and cost  hundreds of  thousands of  dollars  but now  New York's  war of the roses  the state's  longest and  most bitter  divorce action  is lurching  to an end  Nicholas  a former  partner  at Wall Street  powerhouse  Bear Stearns  and his ex-wife  Barbara  have been  slugging it  out  since 1983  83  wow  what was she  trying to  greedily get  her fucking  non-working  mitts on  it was a fight  over assets  that has spawned 
[03:32:00]  thousands of  hours of  courtroom testimony  the couple  have been  legally divorced  since 1988  but the battle  has endured  another 17  years  him trying to  hold shit  that he bought  and worked for  and her trying to  dig her fucking  housewife lay on  your back  claws into it  that's what it was  her head belongs  in a bowling ball  bag  certainly does  that'd be nice  you understand  right  you know why  they put it  on the same page  you know  I wouldn't do it  but I 
[03:32:30]  understand  he's accused  he's accused  her of humiliating  and demeaning  him and calling  him a bozo  in front of  the kids  a bozo  whoa what  harsh language  she is  something  so it just  went on and  on  what a drip  and now the  guy has to  sell his  dream home  in Staten  Island  the house  is worth  like 2.5  million dollars  it's a 17  room mansion  he's got to  sell it  he has to  sell the  house  why to  liquidate  it  to give  that  yep 
[03:33:00]  fucking  ugh  don't you  hate it  yeah  but you know  what  in a way  I do  and in a way  you know  what  you guys  deserve  what you  get  especially  now  anyone  that's  getting  married  now  why  would  you  do it  without  signing  paperwork  she's  going to  challenge  it  anyway  but why  would  you do  it  you would  still  get  screwed  even  with a  prenup  because  you'll  still  go to  court  they'll  try to  fight  it  you'll  get  the  you know  what the  best  rule of  thumb  is  eh  not  getting  married  nope  that's  it  that's  it  love  you  darling 
[03:33:30]  that's  why  I was  smarter  than  you  I'm  smart  hey  what did I  think  I was  broken  20 grand  in debt  what the hell  was she  going to get  half my  debt  good  get divorced  and go  okay  you owe  10 grand  I own  10 grand  why would  why would  the guy  have to  pay for  the lawyer  of the  why  I don't  understand  that's  how it  works  oh I  had to  write over  a big  fat check  to Dominic  Barbara  why though  because I  was responsible  for paying  for her  because that's  the way it  is  believe me  I asked  why  a thousand 
[03:34:00]  times  I asked  why  why  why  I was  like Don  Geronimo  in the  shower  crying  why  why  watching my  checkbook  get run  over in the  driveway  alright  I didn't  prep for  the story  it gets  even better  okay  but first  let me  really fast  say that  the battle  lasted so  long  this divorce  case  that four  of the  dozens  of jurors  who've  heard  evidence  have since  died  died  died 
[03:34:30]  so okay  they get  divorced  in 83  like I  said  right  yeah  but they've  been fighting  since  uh  did I say  1988  something like  that  they've been  divorced  in 88  but started  no no no  don't confuse  the issue  oh  they've been  slugging out  since 83  in a fight  over assets  that has  spawned  thousands  of  okay  you're  right  divorced  since  1988  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  for 19  months  the wife  said she  uh  wait  for 19  months  says he  adhered to  the terms  of the  agreement  okay  so there 
[03:35:00]  was an  agreement  and he  adhered to  it  okay  for 19  months  for 19  months  it was  $3200  a month  in maintenance  and child  support  while continuing  mortgage payments  for their  former home  on Longfellow  Avenue  whatever  sounds reasonable  but then  more than  reasonable  then the  husband  made millions  from a public  offering  of Bear Stearns  stock  Anthony  son of a  bitch  this is after  the divorce  after the  divorce  that's what  happens  the paperwork  is signed  yep  but then he  gets this  windfall  makes millions 
[03:35:30]  of dollars  from this  Bear Stearns  stock thing  so she goes  back to court  of course she  does  to win a  ruling  that the  1983  separation  document  was not  legal  even after  the couple's  divorce  was made  official  in September  1988  so the  battle  all of a sudden  continues again  because all of a sudden  he on his own  made some money  after their divorce  after their life  together  their life  together  is done  officially  by the court  system  comes swooping  in like a  vulture  is she saying 
[03:36:00]  that because  whatever caused  them to allow  that windfall  started when  they were married  oh I'm sure  that was it  yeah  so a new  round of the  it's the weirdest  last name I've ever  seen  Purpura  P-U-R-P-U-R-A  Purpura  oh no Purpura  Purpura  he doesn't know  I don't know  anyway  so a new round  in this case  began in March  2003  and finally  concluded with  the order  for the dude  the husband  here to sell  his home  but 
[03:36:30]  the husband  says he'll  go on fighting  good  they can  sanction me  all they want  and perhaps  take my home  but I'll never  give up  until I have  a fair  hearing  why  why should  he have to  sell his  home  why should  he have to  sell his  home  why  at the 20  years  can this  fucking  bitch  go to  work  you  vulture  and contribute  something  vultures  them and the  scumbag lawyer  that she  hired  yep  the laws  in this  country  the divorce  laws in this 
[03:37:00]  country  oh my god  it gets even  better  what happened  the once  wealthy  you know  husband here  who spent  more than  a hundred  thousand dollars  on six different  divorce lawyers  has appealed  so many times  that he is now  representing himself  he has no more  money left  he has no more  money left  oh my god  this divorce  has destroyed  me financially  I lost my job  because of this  and my second  marriage too  the husband said  but I won't  stop fighting  even if I have  to live in  a pup tent  wait wait  how much  did he spend  a hundred thousand
