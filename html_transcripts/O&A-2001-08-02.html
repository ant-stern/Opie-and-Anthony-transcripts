<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into MTV's 20th-anniversary special.  The hosts and callers relentlessly mocked the VJs' appearances (Nina Blackwood's hat, Sporty Spice's weight), on-air personas (Carson Daly's failed "ghetto" act, a new VJ's disastrous Huey Lewis interview), and the overall decline in music video quality and airtime, focusing heavily on the short video clips and censorship.  Jesse Camp's MTV past was also a target of ridicule. This segment included a lengthy, graphic discussion of various sexual positions, featuring creatively vulgar names coined by the hosts and callers. A significant portion was devoted to a *South Park* episode featuring shocking content, including depictions of child sexuality and animal abuse, with guest Lewis Black providing commentary on the episode and television censorship in general.  Audio clips from both the MTV special and *South Park* were played throughout.

The show transitioned into a loosely connected series of calls and in-studio conversations.  Initial calls covered Tommy Lee's drum solo and hairy armpits at a Grateful Dead concert, segueing into discussions about men's perceptions of women and the pursuit of sex despite unpleasant social situations. A caller recounted a disastrous opening act performance for Ray Charles, followed by another detailing a similar experience opening for Chicago due to excessive swearing.  The conversation then shifted to a technical glitch-plagued man-boob contest on the show's website.  Lewis Black, still in studio, discussed his encounter with Jenna Bush, who asked him to cease making jokes about her on the show. Craig Kilbourne called in to offer further details about this encounter.  The discussion also touched on Lewis Black's upcoming shows, the Chandra Levy case, and his experience on *Homicide: Life on the Street*.  Other calls included a report of a couple having sex in a department store during the "Sex for Sam" contest.  Extended promotional segments for Sam Adams beer and the "Sex for Sam" contest punctuated this section. The segment concluded with a discussion of Kevin Smith's *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back* and GLAAD's criticism of the film, provoking further offensive jokes and listener calls.  A humorous call to a caller's mother to reveal his homosexuality was also featured.

The next segment featured a caller initially feigning distress over a suicidal girlfriend before revealing he was gay.  This led to a discussion of Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, with exaggerated descriptions of its effects.  Malik, a self-described hip-hop fan, called in suggesting more black urban content, sparking a conversation about race, a proposed "rape contest" sketch, and further mockery of Carson Daly's attempts at connecting with black culture (including a played audio clip). Malik also suggested using "peace" instead of "goodbye."  Mario Cantone then called in, sharing negative opinions of his experience hosting *A&E Biography Goes Ape*, delivering impersonations of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (before and after strokes), and making jokes referencing *The Planet of the Apes* and *South Park*.  Cantone promoted his upcoming stand-up show.  The show proceeded to "What's in My Pants," a game involving a female caller, Chrissy, describing her pubic hair style via sounds created by rubbing her phone against herself.  The hosts and callers then guessed the style, using highly sexually suggestive language.  Playboy and Penthouse were mentioned.  The hosts then discussed "Sex for Sam 2," playing a clip highlighting a couple's failed attempts. The broadcast concluded with the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, featuring listeners sharing their takeaways, mostly centering on sexually explicit jokes and pop culture references.  Throughout the entire show, various sponsors and upcoming events were promoted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the ONA show. Red rocket. Red rocket. Red rocket. We got lots to talk about today.  A couple phone numbers for y'all. For y'all. Y'all. For y'all. New York. The New York area. Give us a call. 877-692-1027.  Everywhere else. 866-2774. Wow. We should post these phone numbers on opieandanthony.com so we don't have to give them out every day. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah. And all the radio stations that are picking us up, they should post these phone numbers. Absolutely.  Because the participation is very, very important to this radio show. Oh, jeez. I don't want to get the eights, fellas.  That's the eights. Well, we can talk about South Park. We can talk about that MTV mess last night.  Ugh. Here's something, MTV. Why don't you pay your VJs a little bit so you can get some talent on TV.  Oh, my God. Holy S. What an abomination of entertainment. Oof. Awful. We'll get into that a little later, I guess. 
[00:01:00]  In a coffin. Anyone else notice Nina Blackwood wearing a huge, puffy hat to hide her fatness?  She was wearing a huge, puffy everything. And she talks like Liza Minnelli now.  Yeah, she was completely insane years ago when she was first on MTV.  Now, it just seems like she's completely lost her mind, and she's gained a lot of weight, 
[00:01:30]  and she doesn't want to come out on stage looking all fat.  Okay. So, uh, she wears this thing. I don't even know what era in American or world history it's from.  I think that's from the Roosevelt era, I think.  Is it? I would go back further to, like, the stagecoach days.  She looks like early 1900s.  Yeah? Sure.  Woodrow Wilson?  Woodrow Wilson?  Yeah.  1910, let's say.  Yeah, you're right. So, like a Woodrow Wilson era.  And it's all black. It's like, you know, ugh.  Looks like she was at her own funeral. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah. And all you saw was her puffy jowls hanging from below that hat.  Awful.  It was, uh, it was bad. It was a mess last night.  Here's something. You got Aerosmith? Let them play their song.  No, they had to cut away so they could, um...  Do a 60-second promo for...  MTV.  MTV, and have various, uh, husbands, uh, sing Happy Birthday.  MTV has gotten so paranoid that they don't even play, um, a whole video when they decide 
[00:02:30]  to play videos.  No.  It got to the point where they don't play videos anymore, but now when they do play the videos,  it used to be you could see the whole video.  Now it's like, oh no, we can only give you about 40 to 45 seconds.  Yeah, and then it's gone.  It's like this show.  We come back from commercials, we're only giving you the hooks to the song.  Maybe it works. Who knows?  Maybe they're taking the lead.  What happened to, uh, Sporty Spice?  They cut away from Aerosmith.  All of a sudden they go to the Happy Birthday MTVs. 
[00:03:00]  And I bet you a lot of people didn't even notice, because she went by the screen so freaking fast.  Yeah, Melanie, uh, Sporty Spice there.  Oh, looks like she gave up the sporty.  Woof!  I'm exhausted and I'm starving.  I'm just gonna sit here and eat.  She puffed up real big.  Yeah.  Portly Spice, they call it out.  I'm Portly Spice.  Loaded Spice. 
[00:03:30]  It was just a mess last night. It was a train wreck.  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, that was the first time I saw MTV play a video in 10 years.  What video did they play?  Just clips like Blondie Rapture.  Oh, yeah, all that stuff.  What a mess that was.  Well, you know, then they have MTV2 now that plays videos all the time.  But the problem there is they have a tight rotation.  The best thing I saw was V821 Kiss behind the makeup.  Behind the makeup.  Yeah.  It's like the dopey radio station.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:04:00]  It's got its own sound effects. I like that.  It's like dopey radio stations.  Their playlist is so tight.  They replay the same 10 songs on M2 over and over again.  Right.  Oh, it's all videos, but you're seeing the same ones.  Do we have audio of Carson Daly acting ghetto?  Yo, G.  Yo, you were funky, fat, and fresh.  Yo.  I like you because you don't front.  You aren't frontin'.  Frontin'.  Yeah, go ahead.  I got to be biased because I've been at MTV a long time, 
[00:04:30]  but this guy right here has got to be my favorite.  I mean, come on.  Man, I'm not doing anything.  Anytime MTV need me to do anything, I'm there.  But you don't front.  You don't talk about it.  You have to be there.  Talk about it.  You're the man.  And the music is so real and so good.  But I try my best, man.  I try my best.  I try my best.  Carson, you're white.  Act it.  You don't front.  You don't front.  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, yo, my man.  My man. 
[00:05:00]  Yo, give me some cheddar.  Hey, I'm Carson Daly.  Hey, I'm Carson Daly, and I'm a complete tool.  But Carson, did he just look at the other VJs and go, okay, this is for me down the road.  Here it is.  I'm next.  What's going to make him any different than any of the other people on MTV?  MTV is a meat grinder.  They go in.  They get spit out.  You never see him again ever, ever, ever.  Who's the new guy?  The bald, fat kid. 
[00:05:30]  He sucks.  Oh, my God.  He looks like our old intern, for Christ's sake.  Eesh.  It's like they give Matt Pinfield a lobotomy and throw him out on stage with a few more tats.  This guy is just a complete zero.  Unbelievable.  He's trying to talk to people.  He doesn't even know what they're saying.  Oh, you got the clip?  He doesn't even listen to them.  He's not listening to them.  We got the clip where he asked Huey Lewis a question, and he doesn't even let Huey answer it.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  So what's going on with you guys now? 
[00:06:00]  You guys are good?  You're having fun?  You're getting drunk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're getting drunk.  Right now, we're going to look at more MTV exciting moments from 86 to 90.  Do join us.  He doesn't even let Huey finish.  The best was Huey.  He was dumbfounded.  He's looking into the camera like, uh.  Hey, you're getting drunk?  Uh, well, um, yeah, he's getting drunk, and, you know, we'll be back with more.  Oh, he asked him, like, three questions, like, hey, how are you?  How's everything going? 
[00:06:30]  I figure he's going to talk about any projects he's working on.  And he's just like, you're getting drunk?  All right, cool.  Yeah.  Mikey, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  Hey.  Did you listen to Jesse Camp and how we're all waiting patiently for his new album and all this new stuff that he's working on?  Yeah, his Southern Blues record.  Because he's off the dope now.  Because this Hanoi Rocks, uh, thing didn't work too well a couple years back.  You know what?  This is a pure case of this, uh, waste of space.  Jesse Camp.  He was on MTV.  He had this little gimmick to get himself on. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, Misa a retard.  You know, he'd act like a complete buffoon.  Hey, Misa gonna play in a band?  Yeah, he was a retard.  So he'd get up there with his retard act.  And they bought it.  They, uh, uh, voted him the, uh, VJ thing.  They made him a VJ for a year.  Right off the streets.  With his little act.  And he's done.  He was an A-hole.  They threw him away.  And that's it.  Now he comes back and it's like,  All right, look, I'm Jesse Camp.  And, uh, really, if I knew, uh, being that big a retard was gonna, uh, totally put any career I would have dreamt, uh, on hold. 
[00:07:30]  See, that's, uh, that's like a publicist or something getting in the way.  Like, all right, let's, uh, let's flatten out the hair.  Let's tell everyone that it was the drugs and the alcohol.  Yeah.  You're sober.  You're straight-laced now.  Hey, I'm, I'm, uh, clean and sober now.  Doing some, you're gonna be doing some soulful stuff now.  My new album?  This is your whole new image, man.  You gotta work with me here.  Work with me.  It's soulful.  Okay, Jesse Gray, let's go to this clip.  Hey, this Gray, I'm at the beach.  Oh, we got a good time. 
[00:08:00]  It's so much fun.  It's so, I don't even know how to talk.  I talk like a baby.  You know what, though?  They didn't work too well on dressing him.  You see his stupid boots?  Those nice boots.  He still has to, uh, dress like that.  He should go right back on the drugs.  It's Pauly Shore on crystal meth.  Mr. Korea gonna die?  All right, Mike.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Rick.  Hey, Rick, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Listen, didn't downtown Julie Brown look like a freaking mannequin? 
[00:08:30]  She scared the F out of me.  Well, time hasn't been kind to downtown Julie Brown.  But she was standing to the hottest piece of ass.  It's so funny, because they're bringing back all the old VJs, and you go, oh, yeah, remember  that one?  Yeah, I doubt it.  Like, Dan Cortez was as huge as Carson is right now, and you're like, oh, yeah, Dan Cortez.  Oh, he's huge.  He was huge on that channel.  Yeah, but I doubt it was the hottest one.  Time has done her justice.  Who?  Who?  I doubt she was standing next to downtown Julie Brown.  She barely looked at the camera, but she's a Spanish hot piece of ass. 
[00:09:00]  Nice.  Cafe latte.  All right, boys.  Hey, what about Adam Curry?  Did you see that mess?  Adam Curry?  I didn't see him.  No, I didn't see him live, but they keep showing the old clips, and he's just got this, you  know, lion from...  Oh, I need...  Yeah, but see, he's probably the only one that knew what it was all about.  He's like, hey, I did this thing, and I moved on.  He's like an entrepreneur.  He's worth, like, millions of dollars.  Really?  Millions.  Yeah, that's true.  But he married, like, an older lady, though. 
[00:09:30]  People Magazine did a great little thing on MTV in the first 20 years.  And Adam Curry, I think he's, like, 28 or 29.  His wife is, like, 51, 52 years old.  But he's...  I found me a toy boy, kid.  Kid!  I married a millionaire.  But he pretty much doesn't want anything to do with him.  He knew it was just a stage in his life, and he's moved on, and he's made an incredible  career out of...  with himself, you know?  You know what my favorite part of the night was? 
[00:10:00]  What?  Watching their news guy.  What's his name?  What's the news call?  John Norris ruined his complete credibility last night with Dave Navarro going, hey, you  got an album coming out.  His album's been out for, like, a month and a half.  It was such a big push on it.  Yeah.  And he's their news guy.  Moron.  Oh, man.  I started cringing at home, like, oh, my God, dude.  The album's been out.  Oh, no.  He doesn't know it's been out for a while.  Pretty much every alternate rock station in America is playing the cut, too.  Loser.  And it was so great to see, you know, Deborah Gibson and Cyndi Lauper and even, oh, the Hanson. 
[00:10:30]  Did you see Hanson?  Oh, my God.  The singer one, the middle one?  The middle one should come out of the closet.  He just has to come out of the closet.  He's got a new David Spade look.  That's working well for him.  The little one now isn't so little.  He's getting a little doughy.  And he looks more like Shaka from Land of the Lost than ever.  And Frank and Hanson looking like, what's his name? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, from Charles and Charles.  Right.  He looks like, uh, Willie Ames, right?  Trying his best Willie Ames impression.  Oh, but he will never, uh, crawl out from under the Frank and Hanson moniker.  And now he's like the shortest one.  Yeah.  The other ones, uh, got bigger than him.  But he was always Frank and Hanson, the one you know the chicks weren't really after.  Oh, um, bop.  Oh, bop, Lily.  Grandpa, we're gonna sing um, bop. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, um, bop.  Eddie, Eddie, play the drums on um, bop.  Now, Lily, we're playing um, bop, Lily.  Um, bop, bop, um.  Uh, Eddie, I have to go to the parlor.  We're playing um, bop.  Grandpa, sit in while I'm away.  on umbop grandpa okay umbop i'm gonna drive dragula down to the parlor

[00:26:00]  app let's just let's just throw it all out you got legal you know we can't say those words every  so often i say one of those words you go well you can't say that word say that louis you can say rat's  ass but you can't say that word and they uh but legal economy central every so often i'll do something  like oh no you can't you can't say donkey well now if the litmus test is uh is south park well i mean  yeah and i think i don't i don't see how they get this stuff through i don't either unless it's you  know how i think matt and trey have gotten to the point where they they might even want to just stop 
[00:26:30]  doing the show yeah but instead of just pulling it they they're saying look let's just make each  episode worse and worse until they just throw us and go look guys it's over well yeah what are you  doing andy how's it going good yo the red rocket segment that was the funniest thing i've ever  ever seen me back it me back it me back it red rocket red rocket red rocket red rocket red rocket  and you just see it blast off right there it blasts off big drops and stuff yeah just like wham it was 
[00:27:00]  right there the dog goes ah they thought they were milking the dog that's what they thought they thought  they were milking the dog because the older kids told him if you do that you'll get dog milk  that's what they were saying so they saw nothing wrong with it so they're going watch guys comment's  like what's this guy and he starts doing it the kids are looking out like what are you crazy yeah  he starts doing that the dog's freaking out and all of a sudden bam there it goes

[00:28:30]  the bucket of aids chilly dog he's naming all sexual positions sexual to the kindergarten class  he shows the kids how to roll a condom on and he's got like this uh phallic this little phallic  thing on his desk sticking up and he goes uh first undo the condom wait i got the audio oh you got it  good well they let us play on this that's pretty clear yeah i'm going to show you the proper way 
[00:29:00]  to put on a condom first of all you remove the condom from its package this in front of the  kindergarten then you find which way the condom rolls out put it in your mouth handle five  he did it like the hookers do it when they have to put it in their mouth so you so uh that you don't  know they're rolling it on ruins the moment when they do that it's a real talent uh if a girl can put it  it in her mouth and roll it on put it in your mouth yeah that's phenomenal put it in your mouth

[00:38:30]  yeah right well uh listen what i want to talk about was is the fact that like with tv and with  the radio and everything like all the jesus junkies like to make this big fuss about what they can say  on the radio and what they can't what they can say on tv and tna and all that other stuff like what  people really want is tna and cursing and everything else i don't see why sponsors can't figure that out  well because uh there's a few people out there that uh are the loudest that don't like it like the 
[00:39:00]  majority of people people can never understand why critically acclaimed films uh do poorly and real  crap breaks records consistently because people love crap just like whole country yeah i mean they just  pile on to what crap how else can you explain uh the success of this program  so the country loves crap you love all the dirty nastiness but the people that make the most noise 
[00:39:30]  are the people that um you know the religious people uh the special instrument anyone with a  a letterhead well we're yeah we're too busy watching it to talk that's right exactly we're watching  the stuff they're out there going they're not they've got a lot of time you know why you enjoy  just going through life and watching your tv or listening to your radio doing your fun things  who the hell has time or the mindset to sit down and write letters and be an activist uh against 
[00:40:00]  uh entertainment you know who's got that retards but who do the advertisers listen to retards  yeah no it's you know and then they feel like they know for everyone else yeah i hate that they're  they're going to speak for everybody well it's because they know more than you do well it's family  product you get that procter and gamble thing you know as soon as you say prime hallmark cards you  know it's like it you know it's like and then if you know procter and gamble is you know brought to  you by jesus you know by jesus who didn't really care i love them but you gotta love those jesus people 
[00:40:30]  because otherwise we don't exist right thank god for them well without them we're in a vacuum  you know what i mean we it's just us but if you got somebody who actually thinks what we're doing  is bad then you feel even better about it you're like cool i'm pissing someone off yeah that's our  whole goal this worked anthony hey what's up hope anthony lewis how's it going good man yeah i got a  real class maneuver for you guys i can't wait it's called the roman war helmet uh-oh all right listen  listen uh anthony because we want this on the radio i i i'm really good i'm good at it i got it

[00:53:30]  like the big just picture a big oily hairy man hand sweating pulling that big metal iron brake on the  locomotive sparks flying out between the wheels of the track  that's her when she hits the stage that's her the cold tender flies into the locomotive 
[00:54:00]  oh awful awful the cold tender flies  no she was put on that bill so you could go to the bathroom or get another beer is that it oh yeah  it's like the song that the band does when everyone finally sits down you didn't want to miss jay  moore or jim brewer or or dane cook i think was on that yeah yeah they had a fine lineup why don't  the bands leave out the song that everyone sits down to huh why don't they just leave those songs 
[00:54:30]  out i've seen some bands uh that have hit after hit after hit they leave some of the big hits out that  everyone would love and in their place they put these lame songs and it's the everyone sits down  song you know where you're all standing you're kind of pissed because you were you had a good seat but  the guy in front of you standing and everyone's standing and you're standing now you're like all right i'm  comfortable with this and then all of a sudden oh this one you just watch everyone  doesn't the band look out and go holy crap they're sitting down they're not digging this we better 
[00:55:00]  break out free bird early yeah it's not a breakout free bird no one wants to hear our stuff from  the 1999 days no one wants to hear the new stuff that's so funny every concert has that lull period  i call it they come out and start off strong for about 20 minutes everyone's standing and then yeah  they get into the material they're always a sit song it's always a ballad yeah it's always that  you know i saw her yeah and everybody did four guys woke up stage to shoot up during that period 
[00:55:30]  you know i'm just going to do something acoustic now this is one you know we like doing it uh it was  the b-side off of oh everyone's sitting already oh my god they're all sitting now the beer lines are real  long now oh oh no this is our 12 minute epic oh stp that doesn't happen ben i see no that  ben head of the sdp fan club oh ben loves sdp but at least the bands have figured out that the whole  drum solo thing just doesn't work anymore it was very big in the 70s they don't throw that 
[00:56:00]  harry over into the 80s they don't throw that crap down our throats and big in the late 60s into  the 70s you know then anything was entertaining who wanted to sit for the drum solo except drummers  yeah and they would even get bored you would sit there the the drummer would go into some 20 minute  drum solo time for the bass drum boom boom boom and then they get like on the cowbell 
[00:56:30]  that's the part you sit down during the drum solo yeah there's a part of the drum solo that  everyone sits down yeah and then they go but then what i love is when they do that change from the  thing you think that hitting it bigger the whole more acid over here please more heroin how about the  bass player coming out for a solo just bass solo our bass player wrote this rock and roll but that was  but the reason drum solos are big is drugs always determine what the music is right that's true the 
[00:57:00]  drugs do you know and we on acid you know you could they could have actually just they could  have left the stage nobody louis you ever go to a grateful dead show oh yeah and then six hours and  sit through the drums and space oh i was six hours in colorado that with a fever with a fever which  is the only way to see them really for six hours and they yeah right and i'm like doing them doobie  after doobie after doobie and watching and they got to that section and i danced for an hour and a half 
[00:57:30]  during the second that's how far gone i was you have to be far gone to sit through drums and space  with the dead and they would just go on like a 40 minute mess just a musical mess and they they  what did they call it because it was freestyle they they had nothing planned they just went with  it live yeah it was like it was it was the worst oh all that you know and then there'd be like you  know and then and then jerry be playing like oh my god not just for like 20 seconds how do you 
[00:58:00]  sit through that same thing for maybe 10 straight minutes 45 minutes 45 minutes you have to be on  drugs hello what else what else could get you through it and i did i literally at the end of  the concert my my fever had broke and that was the only they cured you how sick is that night and to  this day i think you know uh they cured me that they cured me fantastic you know but i didn't get in  a truck and follow him around for the rest of my life now which which could have happened back then 
[00:58:30]  jay what's going down what's up guys hey remember van halen concerts where they had a friggin a half  hour bass solo oh my god you know that's right when we're talking about the solos that's what i was  referring to i just didn't want to call the band out because i really do like those guys but they  would have a section of their show where who didn't want to eddie who didn't want to hear eddie do  a guitar solo but the problem you had to sit through um uh what's his name on drums and alex  and then uh michael anthony would be playing that long bass solo and then finally eddie would come 
[00:59:00]  on come on and rip it up yeah thank god for drugs huh all right yeah yeah take care guys all right jay  awful uh aaron's gonna explain drums in space oh thank god thank god aaron hey what's up guys hey  how are we doing today good um yeah with drums in space the dead i mean they would play they would  play drums first half the guys would go off the stage get all high and they come back and they  have to go off and they play space that's the only reason they put them back to back for really  yeah come on 
[00:59:30]  that's all i got guys just so they could get high yeah man they were already peaking though  yeah you gotta keep it going though who could forget in the 80s tommy lee had to outdo his  uh self every uh tour with the new drum kit and he had the one that was on the gimbals  and he would spin the whole one levitate him up in the air and then it would spin out into the  audience yeah it would push him out over the audience and then he would go upside down  and right side up spinning with his drum kit as he does his solo you know what that rocks  that rocks yeah it brought us something new to the drum solo he's over the crowd spinning doing his 
[01:00:00]  drum solo who didn't want to see it and then but the drug at that time in the 80s is you've got  cocaine lots of coke lots of coke and juice you know people are doing alcohol and coke so that's perfect  yeah i love that that's great i love that yeah you're looking up all coked out grinding your  teeth to knobs going look at tommy lee man holy yes rich hey man i'm over at the garden 87 and 88  and i saw tommy lee get strapped into the system and spawn and put over the the uh uh crowd yeah i 
[01:00:30]  remember uh uh peter chris doing all sorts of 10 000 year 50 minute drum solo my god how much  drinking did you need to do oh kiss is uh drum wow peter chris had a special drum solo where his  drum the whole drum set would go 100 feet in the air that was fantastic that was his thing man if you  ever wanted to see hydraulic failure i sure did i want to see him pummeled plummet back to the earth  another guy wants to talk about drums in space rob hey how you guys doing good the best part about 
[01:01:00]  drums in space was watching the chicks with the hairy armpits spin in the lobby yeah oh that was just the  worst man hilarious i know the julian sweat i knew this uh girl that went to uh quinnipiac college  up in connecticut and she was like a severe deadhead and i could not be bothered with the grateful dead  ever i was never into it i never went to a bunch of shows love nothing loved it and i'm hanging out  at this party and all of her deadhead friends are there dancing to the dead i'm sitting there drink 
[01:01:30]  firmly in hand and uh just looking around going what the hell am i doing here here's these girls with  the long skirts filthy black feet hippies just dirty feet and the hairy armpits spinning around to the  dead i'm like jeez and you're thinking you're thinking i'm gonna get laid tonight no i'm like  yeah well right that's why you said through it you know you're absolutely right you're waiting for the  pay off why the hell would i sit if it was guys doing that i'd be on the merit parkway so fast 
[01:02:00]  because back then it was also like you know well you know i'll put up with anything put it up with  it just you know because it might happen so what if she's you know she's she's carrying like uh canary's  nuts in a sack she's so weird you know i'm a wicked all right that's cool that's hot what are my chances  you know i got to assess the situation you know really i i mean that thing where you you see you're  on that you know you'd be sitting with women now in retrospect who would just be talking gibberish 
[01:02:30]  actually you know and you would you would listen oh you're listening some big stupid grin just  because you know yeah i'm gonna get boobies i'm gonna get boobies bravo there's a payoff in the end  there's got to be a payoff for the effort i'm putting in because this is work i clocked in man  i punched in for this it is it's really true it's amazing and you would sit there of course blah blah  blah blah fascinating yeah so interesting you know you're fine you know i hate the entire race of jews 
[01:03:00]  really that's no problem so do i i'm a self-hating jew really i've never had a problem with that  just as long as you touch me as long as you touch me touch it touch it  uh david hey how you doing guys good i went to a boy pound concert in 72  and buddy miles was appreciating act and they had contract problems and everybody had done down so  by the time stop boy brown came on at two o'clock the entire audience was asleep 
[01:03:30]  great there was only about four people awake and you knew they didn't see yeah classic  thanks david i opened for uh you know playing you know i've been only two or three times that i open  for like a in a big stadium for like a ray charles before i really had really my chops were i was  good but not i didn't have the total chops down it certainly should have been in front of 12 000 people  and i got a half hour to fill and that's my contract a half hour a half hour in front of 12 000 
[01:04:00]  that's brutal and that are there to see ray charles they're there to see ray charles and not only  that because ray only does 55 and i'm saying ray because you know we got close um because you know  so you got to do a half then there's a break for 20 minutes and then you know he comes on so  the concert will end at 10 and it'll look like something happened so i'm talking about the stuff  and about and i kind of going through this stuff that because the war you know the iraq the the  the gulf war thing was going on and i do this section that's really about you know how stupid 
[01:04:30]  it is to cover the war in iraq i'm not talking about our presence there just the coverage you know  oh they didn't understand and then all of this i can hear rumblings of the crowd and then i'm thinking  but basically i'm i'm feeling pretty good and the from the moment i walked on stage i said don't ever  get quiet once as soon as you get quiet they're going to snap so i i i'm drinking i go i gotta have some  water so i grab some water as soon as i stopped you're the most unpatriotic son of a bitch we've  ever seen oh no and so half the crowd starts screaming that's right you suck you suck and the 
[01:05:00]  other hand's going shut up he's good shut up and it's like and i have no crowd control experience  yeah and i'm just saying to you can't we all be friends can everybody hold hands really i said it's  only 10 more minutes and ray charles will be here please please don't break down on me now it was like  and i literally had to hold them together for another 10 minutes it was the it was like it was  like being a professional fighter when i was done i walked off stage it looked like i'd been in the  ring with muhammad ali you shouldn't have taken that sip of water no it was stupid because it just 
[01:05:30]  takes one guy and then the rest of the chicken craps that are in there here one guy like yeah yeah  let's get our pitchfork and torches and kill this guy the mob mentality absolutely perfect america  oh america you know what god don't shed his grace on me you know i hope did ray do that  patriotic he did that he did you know georgia you know of course and then and all i wanted to do  was meet the ray letts but you know that was that didn't happen probably from your last name he 
[01:06:00]  probably thought you were black yeah you were booked no doubt yeah i opened for chicago and was  basically let go by them because i swore on stage really you never told me and i said are you and i went  berserk the guy says to me what do you mean he said well you shouldn't be swearing we're a family  show i said are you nuts i said i you start out when you're 18 we're all doing drugs to your music  i'm the same age as you are you a kid i said what is the matter with you i said you don't want me to 
[01:06:30]  swear you tell me before him well we thought you had some self-control i said what kind of self-control  have you idiots shown in your lives you were a great fan and now you stink okay i was like so angry that was  the end of that hey joe what's up hey guys hey worse than any solo or when anyone sits down  is when everyone stands up and starts to sway all the chicks sways on and the hands in the air  lighters like just want to rip their arms off unless you want to sleep with one and then you'll sway

[01:22:30]  you know he redefines idiot you know you had bill clinton and then this schmuck is a complete moron  he doesn't know how to do it he doesn't even know what he's thinking you're not supposed to  kill him first of all that's a kennedy move it hit the paper that he doesn't remember what he did  on the pain that shot or let me disappear you know finally you know finally like what an idiot  you know and then plus you know if you had you know it would be one thing it was you know if  he just had the affair with her and he was like keeping that on the slide but he's had an affair  with like you know anyone who seemed to walk in front of him you know oh here's a stewardess i'll bang 
[01:23:00]  her yeah you know you know it was like whoever wandered into his office yeah and uh now he's saying  did he actually say that he doesn't know what he did the paper uh yeah oh my god i don't know  what i was doing there's certain times during the day that he didn't know what he was doing doesn't  somebody in his position usually have a schedule of events and whatnot things written down that he  did yeah but i guess his climbing gear was on you know that left leg was just shaking and he he  forgets what happens then what's the latest on the rumor that she's buried under a parking lot yes 
[01:23:30]  that was under construction around the time she disappeared yeah right that hit the paper today as well  yeah the uh they got a tip that it's somewhere in virginia some constructed uh parking lot that's  being constructed on near an army but at the time it was near an army base and they're not going to  pursue it because they've got to put it on hold because there are other tips they have to follow  up oh that's what they're saying yeah yeah this was just another put that one on hold it's just  another tip that they got though to this website how accurate is that going to be yeah that anyone could 
[01:24:00]  type it in yeah but yeah she's uh it was uh colonel mustard he did it in the study with the candlestick  yeah really and you know the tough thing about you know you did the tough thing about making jokes  about it is i mean there are guys who can do it but i i just is you know with her she's jewish right  that's all you care about if it isn't a jew you can make jokes about it but when they're in limbo  when you don't know you know if she were dead then then about ten let the laughs fly and you

[01:33:30]  yeah  ralph what's going on today man hey what's going on boys i heard you uh talking about kevin smith there  and uh his problems with uh g-l-a-a-d yeah i'm glad yeah oh what a bunch of tools they are  when he put out chasing amy they were all applauding at the fact that he wrote a  movie that uh dealt with the whole lesbian gay thing right you know and so he comes out with 
[01:34:00]  this movie and and jay and silent bob and jay goes around calling things gay and that's gay and this  is gay and you're a fag right you really look at the subtext i mean there's been a number of times  if you saw dogma see more or less oops yeah jay owes more than anyone else on earth and half of the time  he's thinking about guys right okay so there's the fact that jay might be gay right so and then 
[01:34:30]  also when chasing amy they state the fact that uh at the end of the movie you realize that uh jason lee's  character banky might be gay because he he's constantly calling when he's playing uh uh what is  is it sega hockey he's like oh come on you faggot you know stuff like that and elissa jones played by  uh what was her name joey lauren adams is uh well you know that's just your feelings of of of you're a 
[01:35:00]  homo more or less yeah you know and then supposedly excuse me supposedly in in this movie at the end of  the movie you see that banky jason lee is now dating the black character the very gay black  character from chasing amy hooper so i mean it for them to get up in arms in this is really ridiculous  well it's uh another case of uh being politically correct and uh glad uh trying to use their letter 
[01:35:30]  head you know yeah it's it's really sad but um thanks ralph all right guys let's you want to read  the letter yeah the actual letter that kevin smith got he's got um he's got his website and his website  has a message board and he posted this on his uh message board but get this dear kevin oh  two colleagues of mine from glad joined me last evening at a screening of jay and silent bob 
[01:36:00]  strikes back three gay guys going to the movies i slowly cut a hole in the bottom of my popcorn  box and put it in my lap as he grabbed popcorn until he got to the wonderful surprise at the bottom of  the box i was disappointed the concession stand didn't serve cosmopolitan that's the universal drink  of the homo no that's not in the letter oh it's all good yes two colleagues of mine from glad joined me 
[01:36:30]  last evening at a screening of jay and silent bob strike back we were overwhelmed by the potential  negative negative impact impact oh jeez i had to want to get the eggs fellas  it's a big dick black  hallelujah it looks like you're just about to roll it over your wiener friggin fag you want to make 
[01:37:00]  out or something  it's a big dick black yeah hey ma'am say beautiful  we were overwhelmed by the potential negative impact for the film with what we would assume  is a large share of its target audience teen and young adult males it looks like a morag  it's in the hole oh boy buffalo testicles 
[01:37:30]  we will be public and aggressive in our condemnation and will provide substantiation  for our opinions it's a threat right there here are the points to which we will object  and our reasons for doing so here it is  whoo yeah virgin 
[01:38:00]  howdy  how about a nice bucket of eggs  whoo everybody  it's raining man hey everybody we're all gonna get laid  we're gonna get to you again  hot carl  hot carl  hot carl  oh yeah 
[01:38:30]  the wraparound butt grab  the wraparound butt grab  the wraparound butt grab  hot 
[01:39:00]  it's raining  hot carl  Here are some of his objections.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  It's coming right for us.  Ah, fantastic.  Well, we're waiting, Eddie.  Yes.  Here are some of the points that we will object to. 
[01:39:30]  Doggy?  As one of the principal characters states, the film is a big gay joke.  But the joke is at the expense of the stereotype category of people.  Stereotypes rule.  Right.  Hey, what happened to our song?  It ended.  It ended.  It ended.  Oh.  No money shot or nothing.  Oh, my God! 
[01:40:00]  It's raining men.  Start it again?  All right.  Great.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Yeah, one of the principal characters states, this film is a big gay joke.  But the joke is at the expense of the stereotype category of people.  Can we go back to laughing at ourselves?  No.  Holy S.  All references to gay men reinforce them as objects of acceptable ridicule and dehumanization.  We don't want your aid.  So, I guess, yeah, all the references to gay men are negative. 
[01:40:30]  Specific epithets for gay men include not only traditional slurs, but also have the potential  to introduce and expand vocabulary of defamatory words and phrases.  Guys, I'm so glad we got new sound clips.  There's going to be new words for gay people.  Nice head, dick.  Who's that? 
[01:41:00]  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Yeah.  So, they've come up with new terms for gay people, huh?  I'm never hearing that.  Yeah.  And when sympathetic characters substitute the word gay for something that is wrong or stupid,  it validates a common slur used by school-age youth to mean anything unacceptable.  Wait, Ed, I love going off on tangents. 
[01:41:30]  Listen to that Mickey D.  Mickey D.  Yo, turn the music off.  Why?  I can't drive with my windows open.  Forget it.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody's smiling.  Give me the wink here.  That's gay.  Yeah, if they're listening with half an ear, you're sitting there going, hey, man, I'm  listening to Opie and Anthony.  They're really cool.  This is what's coming out of your radio.  Oh, yeah, it's absolutely wonderful, Tyler.  I'm loving it.  All right, Mickey D.  See you.  We ought to do that from time to time.  Just all of a sudden crank a real gay song so the people driving around with their tops 
[01:42:00]  down and the windows open really look gay.  That's a great thing.  So people could look at you in your car and call you a fag.  We like being interactive with our audience, even when we're screwing them over.  It's raining, man.  Woo!  Get me another Cosmo, Rick.  Oh, how's that for a popper?  They're all pink on the inside.  Yeah, they're upset that the word gay in the movie is being used for something that's 
[01:42:30]  wrong or stupid.  Don't, haven't we been doing that for years?  Don't people just say that?  Oh, dear, that looks so gay.  Andrew.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Turn this off.  People think I'm listening to Jay Thomas.  Is he dressed like a sumo wrestler?  Like in his commercials?  We found a new bit.  How many people right now in their cars listening really, really low to the show? 
[01:43:00]  They're just boiling in their hot cars.  We're making everyone close their windows.  They can't roll the window down.  New bit.  And we'll just pull that out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, we'll be talking about something, and the gayest song will just be blasting.  Oh, and we have our ways to do it, too.  You'll have to crank your windows up real quick.  We'll have you where your radio's cranked because of something cool, and we'll go right  into this.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Continue.  YMCA or something will just come blasting. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, Phil, what's up?  Oh, guys, I'm out of gas station right now trying to throw up my tank with gas, and I  hear this on the radio.  I have three guys staring at me right now.  Yeah.  This is hot.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to appreciate the rest of my life.  Don't mess.  Want to have sex with me?  Woo!  Huzzah!  Oh, that's how it ends again.  Oh.  Well, I'm still reading the story.  Start it up again.  Get your balls out. 
[01:44:00]  Slap your ass up.  Slap your scrotum.  It's today.  Though it may not be anyone's birthday.  And it's not near the 4th of July.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We, of course, are familiar with your work as a writer and director and understand the  satire is, large part, an object of your expression.  The intentional excess of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and over-the-top characterizations 
[01:44:30]  and situations are fundamental to its nature.  However, we believe that satirical sophistication is not a fundamental expectation of an audience  bombarded by fag jokes and gags revolving around genitals and simulated sex acts.  What?  How's that for a topper?  Put down the dis-dis-dis-disaurus, faggy. 
[01:45:00]  Also, the inclusion of various other potentially offensive material.  Example, the bits about the acronym,  It's raining!  The acronym, um, C-L-I.  And then there's another letter there.  It's a consonant.  Kind of tucked down in the alphabet.  Uh, they're upset with that.  Racism and child abuse that are, uh, depicted in the movie.  For laughs. 
[01:45:30]  Does an excuse or dilute the omnipresent backdrop of the big gay joke?  They're very upset.  Is there any retribution or remorse for gay-bashing humor?  And they don't want him to write off the behavior of the lead characters,  especially Jay, with what do you expect from someone so dumb?  Uh, shrug, truly trivializes the impact.  So this, uh, gay guy in the group, very upset with the movie. 
[01:46:00]  Now, we've seen Kevin Smith's work.  The guy's, uh, brilliant.  And I think he's made movies like Chasing Amy that show gay people in a very nice, uh, light.  And then he's depicted as a tree-hugging liberal, uh, uh, anti-religious person for dogma by the right.  And then the left accuses him of being a homophobe during this movie.  The guy, hey, the guy's putting out entertainment. 
[01:46:30]  That's it.  There's no agenda.  If there was an agenda, he wouldn't have made dogma.  And if you're offended, just don't go see the movie.  Yeah.  That's it.  Enough people don't go see the movie.  We'll be out of the theaters very quickly.  So get...  Blah, blah, blah.  Get the follow-up on this.  First of all, he says, uh, Kevin Smith says that a lot of his friends, gay.  He goes, uh, his brother's gay.  Kevin Smith said his brother's gay.  I'm sure his brother's happy about the fact that Kevin Smith's telling him when he's gay. 
[01:47:00]  He says, I've said in many an interview, this is from Kevin Smith,  I've said in many an interview from Chasing Amy Onward  that the only reason I never dabbled in homosexuality when I was younger  was because I wouldn't know what to say to a guy after he blew a blank in my mouth.  Hey, what do you say?  Rick, comment.  Hallelujah.  And then he goes on to say that he talked to the guy on the phone. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, uh, Anthony, I know what you would say, though.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What's that?  Uh, well, I got a...  Um, well, uh, yeah, here it is.  Timing is everything.  Of course.  Got some funky-tasting spunk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So guess what Kevin Smith does?  He calls the guy up, gets him on the phone, explains his point.  The guy goes, well, uh, you know, there's not really much we can do now about the film, 
[01:48:00]  you know, because Kevin's not going to change the film for this, uh, gay group.  He goes, uh, how about you make a donation to, um, that, uh, fund for the, uh, the gay  guy that got beat up there on the Midwest?  Matthew.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  That guy.  And, uh, he goes, okay, how much?  He goes, well, Miramax should, uh, give, like, $200,000 to the, uh, foundation.  So he's like, I'm not Miramax, and my pockets aren't that deep.  He goes, how's $10,000?  So Kevin Smith goes, okay, you come in here Tuesday, meet with me, I'll give you a check 
[01:48:30]  for $10,000 for this foundation.  Uh, Matthew Shepard.  That was it.  So, well, all said and done, everything's fine.  All of a sudden, uh, Entertainment Weekly reporter calls him up and says, uh, this guy  from GLAAD is saying you're a just raging homophobe after he promises to give him $10,000  and that you were giving him $10,000 is an admission of guilt on his part.  So now he's just like, you know, take the $10,000 and shove it up your, you know, might 
[01:49:00]  be enjoyed, might be enjoyed depending on how loosely or tightly it's wrapped.  So, again, it's an entertainer who just can't win because groups, uh, they have letterhead.  They have a stationery and love sending letters out.  No, he's going to win, though, because he's getting all this publicity for the movie, and  you know what, more people are going to go see it now.  I want to see it anyway.  Yeah.  But then the French people that probably wouldn't go see it are going to go check it out now.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Billy, what's going on?  You know what, I am so pissed off about those idiots at GLAAD. 
[01:49:30]  I'm gay, and I am just so embarrassed by them.  They will scream about something, these intimidation tactics by saying, oh, you're an admission  to guilt because you won't give the money.  Yet they get behind a gay pride march with a reinforcing of a negative stereotype parading  down Fifth Avenue year after year.  But that's okay.  If there was a straight guy that made a film based on the parade that goes down in Greenwich  Village every year and showed a bunch of flamboyant gay men over the top, touching each other, 
[01:50:00]  GLAAD would come out and say, oh, my God, you are stereotyping.  No, no.  They would say that they were stereotyping gay men by dressing them up like this.  Well, I'll tell you two things.  One, first of all, as far as the gay community, we apologize for Marco.  We're sorry.  Hey, Marco's flaming.  I love it.  We like Marco.  He's out.  But, you know, I'm a middle-of-the-road guy, gay guy, late 30s, white, working class, and 
[01:50:30]  I've said the same thing over and over again.  The only way we're going to get anywhere on a legislative front, and we're not looking  to take over the world, just some basic human rights, is by representation, by being  just a normal person, working, not drinking Cosmos.  By the way, all gay men don't drink Cosmos.  I drink Amstel Light.  Yeah, but we love stereotyping.  Amstel Light and Gabe here?  No, but what I'm saying is we have to lead by example, guys.  You know?  There's not many people that will openly admit to a lot of people that they love stereotyping  it, and I do on a daily basis. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, can you stereotype?  Billy, can you open the...  I love your Rip Taylor and your Charles Nelson Reilly.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Why don't you do any Paul Wynn?  He was as big a flavor as they come.  Yeah, he was pretty good.  You know how he died, right?  Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  Well, he died with a couple of hustlers.  He was doing poppers.  Yeah, he was doing poppers.  Poppers, but he was hanging in all sorts of crowds.  They were choking him, and he was whacking, right?  That's right, Sam.  That was like the...  Hey, that's my point. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, glad I can go cram it, because they're just a bunch of idiots that scream about having  these rights that we should be able to speak and do what we want, yet they elbow everybody  to get what they want.  It's ridiculous.  You make a great point today that they back that mess of a parade every year.  I apologize to the heterosexual community for that parade, because it does nothing but  reinforce a negative stereotype.  It doesn't show the normal working class, normal gay couple just kind of, you know, getting 
[01:52:00]  along.  Supposedly, you know, what that reinforces is that gays never stay together.  I have a relationship for 19 years.  19 years.  19 years.  Jesus.  And, you know, yeah, it does work.  And, yeah, you know, I don't like...  I don't do hair.  I can't color coordinate.  I like sports.  You know, I prefer contact, but that's another issue.  All right, Billy.  Hey, listen, can you do more of your mom from Boston, please? 
[01:52:30]  It kills me.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm sure there'll be news stories.  It'll be great.  What does she think of the gay community?  I don't like the fad of us.  You know, I don't mind going out in Boston, but sometimes I see some fags.  Thanks, guys.  All right, you fag.  Hey, Rick, can you bring in the next stripper?  No, you don't, Billy.  Bring in the next stripper as per the quote in Time Magazine.  Hold on. 
[01:53:00]  Speaking of the next stripper, Chrissy?  Hello?  Chrissy, hold on.  We're going to get to you next, okay?  Okay.  Now everyone needs to know, what will Chrissy do for the Opie and Anthony show today?  Randy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Remember me?  Yes, you were the guy that wanted to hook up with Marco.  And he never wrote back.  And Marco blew him off.  Not in a good way.  Can you believe it?  Yeah.  You know, I don't know what's worse.  People from GLAAD complaining about how, like, how, like, tough it is for us gays or dicks  like that who say, oh, you know, we're trying so hard to, like, fit in. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, why?  You, uh, don't like...  Oh, that guy came off as more of a dick than the GLAAD people.  Why?  Because he's, like, trying to become heterosexual.  No, he's just trying to live his life in a similar way to a normal society.  No, no, you know, that's why he was like, I've had a 19-year relationship and all this  stuff and I've got a job.  It's amazing.  You know, screw your job.  Who else is going to do hair?  Something I learned recently on this show, it's amazing.  Black people don't like other blacks because they're not black enough.  Gay people don't like other gay people because they're too gay or not gay enough.  Or not gay enough.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  What's the problem with that guy just trying to, you know, live a normal life and kind 
[01:54:00]  of just, uh, you know, uh, as we say, fit in.  Yeah.  Because that's the same guy who's, like, sneaking around behind the scenes molesting kids.  No.  Because he's not getting enough at home.  It's true.  Well, see, just because a guy's gay doesn't mean he's molesting children, Randy.  What about Fez?  Well, that's a different story.  But anyways, no.  I mean...  All right, why do you think GLAAD is a bunch of retards?  Well, they're, I mean, I just listened to this story about how they extorted money from  Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  That looks pretty bad.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I understand why we have... 
[01:54:30]  You know what, and I think, because we've talked to Kevin Smith, I think he was just giving  the $10,000 because he thought it was a good cause.  Right.  I don't think he was thinking, oh my God, they're blackmailing me and maybe if I give  money, this whole thing will go away.  He wouldn't sit there and give it to the GLAAD and write a check to GLAAD for $10,000  as extortion money.  Yeah, the guy brought up, hey, how can I make this better?  And they brought up the foundation, the Matthew Shepard Foundation.  He was just trying to work with them a little bit, that's all.  I don't think he really cares what GLAAD thinks of him and his movie. 
[01:55:00]  No.  And now they're saying it's an admission of guilt, like he's saying, okay, I'm sorry  for the movie, but I'll do this to make it better.  And he said, no, I'm not sorry for the movie.  What you said before is totally true.  All gay guys hate each other.  Really?  You're all a bunch of little bitches.  True.  You're all whiny.  All right, Randy, we got to take a break.  This is getting a little too gay for us.  Take care.  All right.  We're trying to have open minds and stuff, but we're going into the gay zone.  Hey, as long as your mind's the only thing that's all open, there you have it.  Well, we should play, what do you want to play, High Mom, I'm Gay, or If I Were Gay 
[01:55:30]  by Stephen Lynch as we take a break here?  I like the High Mom, I'm Gay.  Can we get that real fast, Rick?  Just for the accent alone, it's great.  Mom, darling, I'm a rope swallower.  Chrissy's up next.  I think she wants to play What's In My Pants.  Becky, the 18-year-old girl with the huge firm boobs from yesterday, let us down.  So I think we could go along with this.  What's in my pants today?  Well, she didn't let us down.  She just didn't want to play.  By the way, people checking out her pictures in record numbers.  Oh, absolutely.  If you didn't listen yesterday, we had an 18-year-old lifeguard come in with really, 
[01:56:00]  really nice breasts.  Really nice.  They're replaying the MTV from last night, that mess that we talked about earlier.  Yeah.  And they're interviewing Hanson, and I just started laughing.  Oh, Munster.  Look at the older one.  The oldest one is still Frank and Hanson.  He doesn't look as bad as he used to, though, because he got rid of the braces and things.  Herman Munster Hanson.  But he still looks like Frank and Hanson.  He's still the one that you know the chicks ask to meet his brothers.  Um-bop, Lily. 
[01:56:30]  Lily, Lily, I need my drum set to play um-bop.  Where's my guitar, Grandpa?  Marilyn, Marilyn, why are you going after my brothers?  Lily, I'm going to the parlor.  Where's Eddie?  Hi.  Yike.  As we break, Anthony, a little game we like to play from time to time called, 
[01:57:00]  Hi, Mom, I'm Gay.  Right.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  You've got to try to convince her, man.  All right, I'll do my best.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, darling? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It's Barbie.  Barbie?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah?  Well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I've got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous.  Something I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Barbie, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me? 
[01:58:00]  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Barbie.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Barbie?  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I had to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Barbie, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell you faster than that.  I'm not even going to bring it up. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Barbie, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me.  I haven't had enough heartache.  I think, you know, good God.  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Barbie, what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No. 
[01:59:00]  I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  You do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arm's reach.  Barbie, don't give me that balloon, please.  You break my hat when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She's got to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey, Bob. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah.  I'm a twinkie, Bob.  That's how I got the throat this bad, Bob.  I've been swallowing too many ropes.  Hey, Bob.  Bob.  You sitting down, Bob?  Oh, man.  Hold on.  You want to call your mom back and then call us?  Yeah.  I got to get her head out of the oven.  All right.  We'll recognize your voice.

What do you got for the show?  Yo, who this?  O.P. and Andy?  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Yo, what's up, fellas?  O.P. and Andy.  O.P. and Andy.  Damn, man.  Yo, I'm a new time listener, man.  I just started listening to y'all last week, and you guys got me hooked already.  What made you say, hey, I want to check these guys out on a regular basis?  You know what?  Because I'm a Hot 97 fan.  I'm a hip-hop fan.  But, yo, they suck, because the music they play is too commercial.  It's too MTV.  It sucks.  I want to hear somebody that's going to make me laugh, something fresh.  Wait, can I ask you something about Hot 97? 
[02:03:00]  When do you know when one song ends and the other one begins?  You don't, because they all suck.  I'm just too white.  Because, you know, I'm a radio junkie.  I'll tune in on all the stations, see what's going on.  Hot 97, they play the same song all day, I think.  That's why I stopped listening to it.  They need to put my demo in there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  You bust out some rhymes.  Yo, you guys are funny, but I'll tell you what you need to do.  You need to open up your audience to more of a black urban crowd.  Yeah.  We're trying, but we're two white boys. 
[02:03:30]  Nah, come on.  I'm telling you.  Look, this is how you pull the brothers in.  All right.  Remember the young chick we had up there yesterday?  They're going to dump out of that, unfortunately, yo.  Yeah, can't say the T-T word.  I got a good sketch for you guys.  Hold on.  So, that girl yesterday, Becky?  Yeah.  With the nice big boobies.  You haven't seen them yet on the internet?  Nah, I'm about to go check them out in, like, 20 minutes.  You got to steal yourself a computer and look.  I got a computer.  I just never, you know, I never looked on there.  But you guys need to...  Does it still have the serial number? 
[02:04:00]  Yo, that's messed up, yo.  That's messed up.  I'm thinking it's fat, yo.  Yeah.  Nah, nah.  You guys need to do a sketch where you're hooking brothers up with white girls.  That's off the hook, yo.  You need to do that.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah.  That's not a sketch.  That's a nightmare.  No, let me tell you.  That would be the funniest thing.  That's a reality nightmare.  That'll be our rape contest.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:04:30]  We don't have a pepper spray sponsor yet.  I went down to your show.  I went down to your show in Asbury Park.  You had it at the Stone Pony.  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you, I live, like, two blocks away.  Wow.  I started seeing the cops out there.  It's time to go.  Yeah.  Everyone was cool down there.  Hey, were you there for Greek Fest?  Of course.  How was that?  It was terrible.  What's your handgun of choice during Greek Fest?  I like the 9mm with the semi-auto hollow tips. 
[02:05:00]  Isn't that nice?  I like the Glock.  Yeah, Glock 19s are big.  They're all right.  But you know what?  The Glocks are old school.  They don't shoot straight.  I like some nice specials, too.  You don't know where that Glock is going to go when you shoot it.  You guys are hilarious.  You guys are the best.  But you know what?  You need a nice Smith & Wesson.  I'm trying to sound like Carson.  Now, see, we're totally mocking on the fact.  We talked about Carson earlier.  You noticed that last night as well.  He's trying to act like a wigger.  You know what killed me?  Is that this faggot, he has on, he has black nail polish on. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  Sitting there like, yo, B, I really like your style, B.  You're the best MC I've ever heard, B.  You're a faggot talking to the hardest cat in the ghetto, damn, yo, B.  What's up with that, man?  What about when he goes, hey, I like you because you don't front.  Stop.  Was he wearing fubu?  I get embarrassed when Carson does that crap.  He's trying to fit in, you know, too much.  And he talks to, like, the black rap artist and he makes believe he's one of them.  Let me tell you, two white boys like y'all, I'll sit there and smoke hash and weed with y'all all day. 
[02:06:00]  Nice.  Hey, cool.  Hey, we got the Carson clip.  Listen to Carson trying to, you know, sound like he's in.  Like he's down with it.  Down with it.  I see this guy on the deuce.  Hold on.  I'm going to punch him so hard in his face.  What's on the deuce, man?  40 Deuce.  42nd Street.  Oh.  The deuce.  Of course.  The deuce.  Strong with you.  Come on, aren't you guys from New York?  Yeah.  Broadcasting from the deuce.  I'm just trying to work the word cheddar into my everyday vocabulary.  How come that's not 50 seconds or 30 seconds? 
[02:06:30]  What do they call 30 seconds?  Nah, it's 57 seconds.  I get at you at 57 seconds.  Hey, I want to know why 42nd Street is the deuce.  Why is it the deuce?  Yeah, and why isn't 52nd the deuce?  Because it's, because 42nd, Times Square is the most popular place in New York.  Oh, so you just assume that it's 40 and the deuce, too.  The deuce.  When you say the deuce, everybody in the hood knows the deuce.  I'm down with it.  Hey, I know what they call 8th Avenue.  What?  And I swear to God, this is the truth. 
[02:07:00]  They call it 8th Avenue.  What?  Hold on.  You can't say that.  Why is that?  I never heard that one.  I was reading a book.  And that's the nickname for 8th Avenue.  Swear to God.  I never heard that one.  I couldn't believe it myself.  You guys are hilarious.  Hey, here's the clip.  Carson trying to act black.  Here it is.  Yeah, I gotta, I gotta be biased, because I've been at MTV a long time, but this guy  right here has gotta be my favorite.  I mean, come on.  Man, I'll do anything. 
[02:07:30]  Anytime MTV need me to do anything, I'm there.  But you don't, you don't run, you don't talk about it, you're happy to be there, and you're  the man, and the music is so real and so good.  But I try my best, man.  I try my best.  He was really laying it on.  You don't front, you don't talk about it.  The music is so real and so good.  It's so real.  What is he doing, whacking off to the music?  It's so good.  So real and so good.  What is up with this guy?  You know what? 
[02:08:00]  I'm telling you, you guys need to have some brothers on your station.  I'm telling you, you guys will get that.  We have the brothers on every so often.  We got Black Earl.  Yeah.  He's not a brother.  You know what?  Let me tell you.  The brothers hate Black Earl.  You guys need to invite a real, look, you guys need to invite a real nuclear to the station.  Hey, Black Earl's good.  Don't play a hate, play a participate.  Look, I could do that too if you hooked me up with some of them Italian sisters you got.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's the only reason I came out there and checked you guys out.  You like the white girls? 
[02:08:30]  What?  You do all right.  Nice.  All right, Malik, we got to let you go.  You check in, all right?  You're all right.  Definitely.  You guys be cool.  You're right.  Peace.  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah, you guys are funny too.  Yeah.  Yo, look, you guys have to say this now.  Instead of saying goodbye, you got to say peace.  What do you say peace a little bit?  Peace.  We just sound too white and stupid.  You got to come.  Look, man.  I'm doing it as a joke with Old Dirty, but I know how ridiculous I sound.  Come on.  You can't.  You can't.  Do you go peace or just peace? 
[02:09:00]  You can't diss Old Dirty.  No, we like the Old Dirty.  Look, D-Rocks.  He gave us a bunch of great scams to try out.  You got to love the man for that.  Definitely.  My word.  That's my word.  You guys got to say that.  Peace.  All right, we got to let you go, Malik.  All right, fellas.  Peace.  Peace.  Okay, Mario Cantone is on the line.  Hey, Mario.  Mario.  Yeah, thanks for putting me through that.  What?  All right.  You know what?  I'm going to tell you something.  This is the truth, too.  Yeah.  I was walking up the street one day, and I had just been given a gift, and it was a 
[02:09:30]  yo-yo.  It was an actual Dunkin' yo-yo.  Yeah.  And this, seriously, I'm playing with it on the street, and this guy goes to me, this  young kid, black kid, he was like, yo, man, is that a yo-yo?  I said, I have been waiting for the day for you to put the word yo with yo-yo.  I've been waiting for the day.  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Omar.  Hey.  A friend of mine's here.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony show as we speak right now.  Yo-yo.  So just sit down and wait.  You're with the star.  Yo-yo.  Yo-yo. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  So what are you doing?  What up, fellas?  Well, um...  Yo, is that a yo-yo?  Yes, it's a Dunkin' yo-yo.  Well, we just got in some feedback, and some guy said that you were doing an A&E bi-  Yeah, I hosted A&E Biography this week.  Biography?  Yeah, it was A Biography Goes Ape.  Oh, what?  And it was Charlton Heston and Tim Burton and...  What happened to the Mission Impossible guy?  What do you mean, what happened?  Peter Graves?  Yeah.  Peter Graves took a rest that week, and it was me and my mean... 
[02:10:30]  It's a good thing I didn't see the movie yet.  Have you seen the movie?  Yes.  Just kill me!  You liked The Planet of the Apes, huh?  Helena Bonham Carter looked like Janet Jackson.  Yeah, we said that.  She looked like Maybelline Monkey.  She looked like Revlon Chimp.  Hellacious.  Yeah, it was awful.  Awful!  What about the one that looked like Paul Abdul?  Oh, what about the one that looked like Jocelyn Wilderstein?  There was one Ape that had, like, work done. 
[02:11:00]  It was really weird.  It was very strange, and I'll tell you something.  I love Tim Burton, and I was just very disappointed.  Yeah, Tim.  Well, our expectations were really high, obviously,  but I don't think he got the job done.  Yeah, me too, and I thought it really sucked.  Thank you, Cartman.  I love you guys.  Cartman, did you...  Did anybody see it last night?  Oh, my God.  It was porno.  See, it was porno.  Mario, you should have been here today,  because this is all the stuff we've been discussing all day.  No, you know, I didn't know.  With Cartman, how could we say it on the radio?  He was giving a handy to the dog. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  I know.  I know.  Red racket, red racket, red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  Come on, red racket.  Red racket.  Red racket.  And Butters is priceless in that one.  Oh, Butters is really...  Yeah, I got to put it on.  Here, listen to this.  It's all gooey.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the H, fellas.  When he ever says P-A-D.  I know.  Because I do everything with that.  Like, you know, I just saw that new show,  The Tick, Tick, Boom. 
[02:12:00]  The show that the guy that wrote The Rent.  The Tick, Tick, Boom.  The Rent.  The Rent.  He wrote The Rent Show.  And, you know, he died very young.  He didn't have the AIDS or the cancer,  But he died very young, unexpectedly.  He's got the big casino, Tony.  He's got that, oh, the Tick, Tick, Boom.  It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  You guys.  So, children of the corn,  I'm going to come back and see you soon.  Yeah.  Right now, I'm very busy making motion pictures. 
[02:12:30]  What are you doing now?  I'm doing a movie called Last Request  That I saw at the end of August, beginning of September.  And you know what's so funny?  I'll have to tell you the story.  Wait.  Okay.  I was supposed to go to Amsterdam last Wednesday.  That's right.  But I couldn't because I had to film the biography thing on Saturday.  So, I changed my flight and everything.  I'm in Amsterdam at the Casa de David,  which is a little Italian restaurant.  And this couple next to me, Julie and Jack.  Jack and Julie were my little girl. 
[02:13:00]  So, they came up to me and they were like,  the guy was a big fan of mine and he swore from your show.  Him and his wife were like,  oh, my God, we think you're great.  We visit you on O&A and da-da-da.  Wow.  So, I was very recognized in Amsterdam, ironically.  That's so cool.  Because of your show.  Nice.  In Amsterdam.  And slamster slam.  Now, about this biography.  What?  You were doing one on Chuck Heston?  I did one on Chuckles, yeah.  Chuck Heston.  Chucky.  Chuckles, I called him.  And people said that you were just dying over the Gladiator movie scenes that he would do. 
[02:13:30]  He blows.  Don't even talk to me about it.  Let me tell you something.  My taste is a little better than Chuck Heston.  What about young Chuck Heston?  The young, he was all right.  He liked the Mocky Mock.  Damn you.  What about young Chuck Heston?  You know, before I got old and did Soylent Green.  You know, the one where I said, let my people go.  Damn you.  Damn you, Mario Cantone. 
[02:14:00]  Didn't I look good in a loincloth?  You looked great in a loincloth.  You're damn tootin'.  Yeah, you did.  With that bitch on the back of my horse stealing the scene.  That point in your career when you were plowing Shelly Winters.  Yes.  It plowed me really good.  Can I get you a loincloth?  Before she got Poseidon Adventure fat.  I can't wait for that picture.  Wow.  I was there before that.  Wow.  That is a great Shelly Winters. 
[02:14:30]  I was there before that.  I was doing like my own.  And my roommate.  Wow.  Oh, that's, I can picture her sitting next to Carson.  Oh, sheesh.  Who's in her effing mind?  Do a line from the Poseidon Adventure.  Mary, Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not.  Give this to the kids.  I'm going to swim in.  I tried all my leading men, you know.  Every one of them.  Every one of them.  Every one.  Jane Francesca, Tony Francesca, Laura McCall. 
[02:15:00]  Every one.  Laura McCall.  Here's the prettiest one.  Even, what's his name from Chico and the Man that you were in?  Harold Hamilton.  Yeah.  No, he was too skinny.  Well, his penis was.  God damn.  Marty Quinn would have probably told me he was good.  Who the hell does Shirley Woods is?  Only me.  That's right.  You boys are quite marvelous.  You really are.  So, I'll be coming back to see you soon. 
[02:15:30]  Yes, you do that.  Hey, Marita.  Yeah.  I hate to put you on the spot, but we're in a bunch of new cities right now.  You've got to do just a touch or a little taste of Judy Garland.  You know, you boys really have a model show.  Like years ago when I used to do my show.  Lorna, Lorna, could you get me those, the candies in the left drawer?  No, the blue one.  Lorna, Lorna, sing with me. 
[02:16:00]  Lorna has a little bit of talent.  Eliza has a whole lot of talent and a good supply of suppositories for her irregularity.  Who knew?  Who knew?  You're marvelous.  You kids are wonderful.  You really are.  You're good actors.  You're good actors.  I don't know.  She just got out. 
[02:16:30]  That's my mouth.  I mean, that man will live forever, you guys.  Thank you.  My name is General Cartman.  This time, we're going to kick ass.  You can't say that.  This time, we're fighting for the glorious ass.  That was one of the best episodes.  It is one of the best ones.  The Civil War one.  It is.  General Cartman.  We've got to talk about Mariah Carey.  I thought you might have something on that.  She's having a breakdown now.  Wait till the movie comes out.  When it comes out, she will flash it all.  Yeah, it seems she completely lost her mind and started breaking stuff. 
[02:17:00]  Her mother had to call 911.  How much would you have paid to be in the room watching her lose her mind?  I'd give anything.  Wouldn't you?  Right at that moment where she's screaming?  And you know how she sings, so the screams are probably like that high-pitched screech she can do.  Oh, I would love to have been there, though, and just watch her lose it.  I would have, too.  Crying, pulling her hair out.  Johnny McCullough, you son of a bitch!  You ruined me! 
[02:17:30]  Well, you know, when Glitter comes out, I'm going to have about ten minutes' new material.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You beat me!  I'm sorry, America.  All right, Mario.  I apologize, America.  My children of the corn.  If you ever get the chance to see Mario Cantone, run.  Yes.  August 26th, I'll be at Caroline's again.  When?  August 26th.  26th.  Sunday night at 10 o'clock.  You're coming in before that?  I'm going to come in before that.  Cool.  All right?  All right, Mario.  I love you guys.  You're brilliant and funny, and you give me, you give Miss Crawford the respect I'm entitled to. 
[02:18:00]  That I would get from any fan on the street!  You literally embarrassed me in front of a reporter!  It's Barbara Bennett from Red Book, Christina.  I want you to behave.  Oh, Christina, I'd like to see you, please, in the other room.  You know what's messed up about Mario when we brought this up?  Oh, that's great. 
[02:18:30]  He does the Joan Crawford.  And Faye Dunaway.  And then he does the Faye Dunaway Joan Crawford.  Yeah, I do them both.  Yeah, I do.  Can we hear the original one?  All right, the original Joan Crawford.  Well, that was Faye Dunaway.  Yeah, yeah.  Could I see you, please?  And the real Joan Crawford is like this.  When I'm on a set, I want my set at 58 degrees.  If it isn't at 58 degrees, I leave.  And at the end of the day, if it's a good one, I turn to the crew and I say,  Bless you. 
[02:19:00]  Bless you all.  Miss Crawford!  And we did the Betty Davis after the stroke, which is my favorite impression in the world.  I could do that all day and just channel it.  All day.  Miss Crawford really, you know, she was a bitch.  Her breasts were a different size every day during the filming of Baby Jane Hudson,  which I was robbed of the Oscar.  Post-toe.  Robbed of the Oscar.  Yes, Miss Crawford campaigned against me.  She went to everyone and said,  If you don't win, please let me accept. 
[02:19:30]  Well, Miss Bancroft won, and she swept by me, clutching the Oscar to her breast as if it were her own.  I love the post-stroke.  She's horrible.  The book was true.  Oh, man.  Of course, the book my daughter wrote about me was totally and utterly untrue.  And it broke my heart.  It was worse than the stroke.  It really was.  Mario, make sure you come in before you can't let me.  I promise.  I'll be in the day before.  I'll be in the Friday before.  And Mario, the Shelley winners.  I think I called her Shirley Winters. 
[02:20:00]  That guy is hysterical, man.  Yeah, he's playing Carolines in late August, like you said.  And for everyone else everywhere in the other cities, if Mario comes to your town, you've got to see him.  He's manic on stage.  He's just like a madman.  He's all over the place.  Really funny.  Okay.  I think we have to take another break, huh?  Shelly Winters.  Holy Jesus.  He does all those old star women when they're past their prime. 
[02:20:30]  This is very...  Who the hell does Shelley Winters impression?  The post-stroke...  Betty Davis.  Betty Davis is the best one.  You can do the before-stroke, but it's not as fun as when she's slurring her words and drooling out of the side of her mouth.  Remember you used to see her, like, on Dick Carson?  On a Merv or something.  Yeah.  Or Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  She'd come out...  And that lip is sagging and drool is coming off.  You're like, ah!  She's Hollywood Legers anyway.  I'm a legend.  Yeah.  Chrissy's still on hold. 
[02:21:00]  Chrissy.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry we left you hanging so long.  I have been waiting here listening to Anthony Sagan.  It's raining men.  Wow, you have been on a while.  All right.  Can I send Rick my phone bill for this?  Are you on a cell phone?  No.  Oh, okay.  Because it's been an hour and 20 minutes.  Hold on.  Wow.  Hold on.  We'll get to Chrissy next.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys that drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball bat. 
[02:21:30]  The weekend's coming and I don't have any money.  No money, no problem.  Saturday night from 7 to 10, it's Brother Wheeze absolutely free.  I don't have a date either.  No dates, no problem.  At 10, Eddie Trunk plays the best hard rock and metal on Saturday Night Rocks. 
[02:22:00]  I'm a total freak of nature.  Saturday night, kick it off with Wheeze at 7.  And at 10, spank your junk with Eddie Trunk.  You dateless punk, 1027.  I need a tissue.  W-N-E-W.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony, Saturdays, 11 to 3, 1027-W-N-E-W.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Let's check in with Cleveland again, Anthony. 
[02:22:30]  Fiona.  Yeah?  21 years old, driving around Cleveland, right?  Uh-huh.  What's going on?  No.  You're on the radio.  Well, I just wanted to ask you guys, you know, I haven't seen any WOW stickers around here.  I was wondering when they're going to come out because I am already the flashing people and there's no stickers.  I love how this is developing.  It's developing nicely.  Yes.  The whole WOW thing takes time, Fiona, but basically the guys are starting to write WOW on the back of their car in homemade signs.  And hopefully the radio station will get some bumper stickers out there for everybody. 
[02:23:00]  And you'll start seeing the WOW.  I've been to a few concerts already.  I saw the X-Screen team, you know, the guys that represent the radio station here for you guys.  And I don't have any stickers.  Now, do you have nice breasts?  Hmm?  Do you have nice boobies?  I've been told.  You've been told.  Look at this, Ant.  She's been told.  She's ready to WOW, though.  And no stickers anywhere.  Or homemade WOW signs.  Guys, I'm telling you, this works like a charm.  Trust us on this one.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Get a homemade WOW sign, put it on the back of your car, and Fiona may just pull up to you on the highway and go,  Here you go.  Woo!  Show you her 21-year-old boobies.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's actually whip them out whenever, but yeah.  We focus on it on Wednesdays.  Thank you, Fiona.  You are very welcome.  Let us know if, you know, you end up doing it because you see someone with the WOW sign, okay?  Okay, if I see someone, I'll call back in.  All right, cool.  All right.  There goes 21-year-old Fiona from Cleveland.  Chrissy.  Back to Chrissy.  Sorry, Chrissy. 
[02:24:00]  It's all right.  We've been busy doing a radio show.  Dedicated fan.  Where are you calling from?  Jersey.  24 years old, Anthony.  Are you at home?  Yes.  Upstairs in your room?  Yes.  Live with Mommy and Daddy?  Yes.  Are they downstairs yet?  No.  Not home from work yet, huh?  Right.  What kind of posters you got in your room?  I'll have my WOW, my WNEW poster from one of your shows.  Okay.  SQP, of course.  Okay. 
[02:24:30]  Bouncing Souls.  And you want to play What's in My Pants?  Sure.  Yeah, I was getting ready for the gym, and I figured, you know, an hour ago.  Yeah.  I know.  Things kind of happen.  Sorry about that.  What do you look like, Chrissy?  Um, about 5'4".  5'4".  5'4".  Dark short hair.  Dark hair.  Dark complexion a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  What nationality are you?  Um, Port Spanish.  Nice.  Nice.  Hope you like that cafe latte. 
[02:25:00]  What is it?  Well, that's with the African princesses.  African princesses.  All right.  Well, I stood out in the sun long enough.  Yeah.  I like my Puerto Rican girls to look Spanish.  Yeah, right?  Ma'am, does it look like a wallet down there?  A wallet.  So, I don't think some of the cities out there have been introduced to this yet, right?  No, Rochester has never heard this one.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, they'll be very happy with this little game. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  And we haven't played in a while, and I think we owe everyone What's in My Pants from yesterday.  Yeah.  So, I think everything is lining up quite nicely.  What kind of body do you have?  What kind of measurements there?  Um, well, on the petite side.  Yeah.  Like, uh, how much do you weigh?  110.  Oh, nice.  110.  Okay.  What about the cup size there?  Um, B.  Sporting some B's.  Nice.  Very nice.  Mm-hmm.  How about that ass?  Can you back that ass up?  Spanish ass, yes, sir.  You got a Spanish ass?  Uh-huh.  So, it's a little bigger in proportion than the rest of you? 
[02:26:00]  Right.  She's got ghetto butt.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, kid!  I might have a bigger ass, but I'll tell you one thing, I look good.  Hey, it works for Carson Daly.  We got to start talking more black on this show.  Yeah!  Yeah!  You ain't frontin', yo!  Yeah, don't be frontin'.  She be back in.  I'm jumpin' in my hoopty.  I'm comin' to see Chrissy.  What would you say your, uh, hip measurements are?  Uh, 36.  36.  36. 
[02:26:30]  36.  This baby got back.  That's what I was on my way to the gym.  Gotta get those, gotta get those big old jeans around the butt.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Then you cinch up the waist with the belt.  What do you got, the skinny waist?  Yeah.  You got the skinny waist, and then it comes out and be that nice, yeah.  I like big butts.  I like that.  You got a lot of brothers that walk by, when you walk by, they go, mm-hmm, that looks good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  God damn, that looks good.  Uh, Matt, you ass on line eight.  Hey, guys, is it really a girl this time?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  It is, Matt.  Yeah.  I hope.  Oh, man.  Really.  Oh, man.  All right.  You know how to play, right?  Oh, definitely.  You want to explain it for the new audience, Anthony?  Yes, Opie.  Chrissy, on the phone, will take her phone, and as per our instructions, rub the phone.  In a certain place, let's just say.  And we will try to determine, just by the sound that comes out of that phone, and you  can play along at home, what hairstyle is she sporting?  Here are your choices.  It could be a standard triangle. 
[02:27:30]  Well, the landing strip or mohawk, which is shaved in on the side, the Hitler mustache,  which is the mohawk, but it has also been shaved top to bottom, so it's just a little  tuft of hair, a Hitler mustache, or completely gone, which is the wood floor, or as we also  like to call it, the JonBenet Ramsey.  Chrissy?  Yes.  You ready to play?  Sure.  Now, don't give us any clues, any hints that might give us some help, and don't tell 
[02:28:00]  us until after we guess what you have in your pants.  The theme song, as you get ready.  Okay.  Get ready for the game.  All right.  Oh, it's not cued up.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The song.  Oh, no.  The song wasn't cued up.  You can't play the game without the theme song.  You need a theme song to play the game.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, guess what's in my past?  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my past?  All right, Chrissy.  If you're ready, let's do the up and down motion.  Okay.  Spaniard.  Okay.  It was up and down.  Spanish girls have that coarse hair.  See?  Ah.  Coarse hair.  I just want to throw a tip out there for everyone that's playing at home. 
[02:29:00]  How about side to side?  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Pauly on line three.  Chrissy was on hold so long, she went from wood floor to making Jiffy Pop popcorn in her  panties.  I think we need that side to side, a little more pressure, and slower side to side.  Okay. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  This is a tough one.  I hope we're not getting duped again, man.  Why?  Did you think you heard a schlong?  I think I heard chest hair.  No.  No.  Do the circular motion, a lot of pressure, and slowly.  And do it a couple of times.  Okay.  All right.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  There's definitely something there.  This is tough.  No, it's not.  It is so not tough.  You have a tough thing?  Listen to side to side.  Side to side.  Side to side.  A lot of pressure.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  There is no doubt in my mind.  You need to hear one more?  Just the up and down again.  Okay. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Do it a couple of times, though.  Go up and down, up and down, up and down.  All right, all right, all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a pole rack filled with afro hair, my friend.  That is a full triangle.  Without a doubt.  Really?  So, you're saying she has the corey stringer?  What?  He's dead. 
[02:31:00]  How did it happen?  Oh, no.  I was just talking to him.  Um, Chrissy?  Yeah.  Make sure you don't tell us any hints.  All right.  I will say, I'm going to have to go with the wood floor as I heard it.  It might seem weird, but, Opie, I'm going to have to do that.  Joe, on line three, it sounds like a canvas tarp blowing in the wind.  Yeah, sometimes that's deceiving, but, uh, Rick, since you're in here. 
[02:31:30]  I'm a little nervous about this one.  You got to guess?  I got to hear up and down again.  Up and down?  We did the up and down a lot.  Yeah, I did.  I got to hear it again.  It's deceiving.  Do, like, the circular motion or something.  Okay.  Again.  Come on, guys.  It sounds like the tide is coming in.  Yeah.  No, I'm sticking with my way, guys. 
[02:32:00]  I'm going to go with, um, final, well, not really, finally, trend, uh, triangle.  You're doing triangle, too?  I got to do triangle.  Triangle, triangle.  Ben?  Ben, you want in today?  Would you hazard to guess?  Ben?  Hitler mustache.  Ben's saying Hitler mustache.  You just didn't want to play today, did you?  So he just threw one out there.  I'm like you.  I'm just scared.  Hitler mustache.  I'm a little nervous myself.  I can't lie, but it's a big C.  All right, uh, Chrissy?  Yes?  What is in your pants?  Well, it's a combination. 
[02:32:30]  What?  It's a combination.  What is it?  Um, finely trimmed triangle, which is shaved underneath.  Finely trimmed triangle.  Triangle.  But, but you, you, the, the hairstyle is a triangle.  I know what she's doing.  Right.  I know what she's doing.  Those are those weird things that look great when they're standing up with their legs real  close together, but the second they're laying on their back, it's like, why is, why is that  there in the middle of no man's land?  It's like this tuft of hair might as well be growing out of her belly button.  Is she talking that it almost looks like the Van Halen's, uh, logo? 
[02:33:00]  No.  No.  It's kind of, um.  You know what I mean?  The, the, the, yeah, the V, with the thing growing off of it.  Here, it looks like this.  Come on.  There it is.  There it is.  Look.  VH, man.  So, I think there's a couple winners here.  Yeah.  I think, uh, the full, well, I said it was really grown in, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's a triangle.  It, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a triangle.  But those are the weird ones, man. 
[02:33:30]  Like, when they're standing, I've seen this in, uh, Playboy and Penthouse.  When they're standing up, and they're almost, they got, they're leaning up against something,  they got their ankles crossed, kind of, and they're leaning, and everything, the thighs  are pushed together.  You're like, wow, okay, that's a very neatly trimmed triangle.  Then they got the shot of them laying on their back with the legs akimbo, and you're looking  going, why did you leave that?  It's like you missed something, you know?  It's just in the middle of her belly, it looks like.  And you go, is it supposed to be that low?  What is it doing there? 
[02:34:00]  I think your junk is too low.  No, wait, do you guys, all right, do you guys understand where, what's going on?  Completely, Chrissy.  The underneath.  Right, the underneath.  Your undercarriage.  It's shaved.  Yeah.  Yes.  How do you do that?  What do you use?  Just a razor.  A razor with a blade?  Well, yeah.  You must, uh, it must be like a nice cherry stone clam.  You know what I mean?  It was.  Tight?  Wait, wait, wait.  Chris.  Mm-hmm.  Who was, who, Malik?  Yeah.  Oh, that's who, okay. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, that scared me a minute.  Oh, my God, I had a heart.  I thought it was her going, no, it's just a big C.  Hey, Chrissy, listen.  Oh, I thought we were ahead again.  I am the master of mommies.  Let me tell you something.  Why, you think Chrissy's a mommy?  No, he's saying.  Yeah, she just said she was a mommy.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Yeah.  I blocked that out.  A mommy, like, with a kid?  Huh?  A mommy, like, as I have a kid?  No, as in, as in Puerto Rican.  Oh, Spanish chick.  Come on.  Come on.  Say, B, go mommy.  See, it proves how white we are.  I'm thinking that she never said she had a kid. 
[02:35:00]  No, man.  She said she was Spanish.  Me neither.  That's what I thought.  Now, listen.  Yeah.  You have a muff.  That's what you do.  Right.  Because that thing down there sounds like you haven't gotten to it in about three years.  No, it's just recently.  Well, listen.  That's not bad.  It's all good.  No, that's good.  Malik wants you, Chrissy.  Yeah, Chrissy.  Actually, I tell you, I have a thing for O'Day.  Huh?  Sounds like the Playboy Ebony channel.  Tell this.  You got a muffin. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, no doubt.  Look, listen.  He's in the muffin room.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Mm-hmm.  Where in Jersey?  Well, Malik.  Malik, you making a date?  This is not a date of service.  Malik, you got the benefits?  Who?  Do you have the benefits?  You got the benefits?  Of course I got the benefits.  I'm a brother, man.  All right.  You don't need the benefits if you're going to get that chick.  We're going to let everyone go.  Okay.  All right.  Chrissy, thanks for playing What's In My Pass.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Love the show. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, Malik, thank you.  Yeah, you guys are awesome, yo.  All right.  There they go.  Peace.  Chrissy and Malik.  Anthony checking in.  Wanting to know if what she was describing was a vag mullet.  Yeah.  Long and then shaved in the back or something.  I don't know.  Tony.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  I think you guys got a new category.  Huh?  The Van Halen.  The Van Halen.  The Van Halen.  You just named it, dude.  We might have to call it the Van Halen.  Shaved on the bottom.  The Van Halen logo. 
[02:36:30]  The top Van Halen logo.  Van Halen logo.  There you go.  All right.  Now you made me go and have inspiration to go to my girlfriend and go shave that in there  a little.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Okay.  Anthony, we've got to take a break.  Then we'll come back and play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  We haven't played that game in a while.  As we go to break, we want to play another clip from last year's Sex for Sam.  New one.  Sex for Sam 2 happening tomorrow.  Jim Cook in the studio.  Yeah.  It's going to be a great show.  You're not going to want to miss that tomorrow.  All right.  Oh, this is Ben's couple?  Which one?  I don't know what it is.  Oh, the loser couple. 
[02:37:00]  This is Ben's couple calling in from some other restaurant where he's just drinking.  Oh, this was at the end of the competition.  Well, this thing's a pretty good setup.  All the couples we had last year doing Sex with Sam, having sex all over the city for  the points and stuff, were doing really well.  It was very heated, and we didn't know who was going to win right up until the last minute.  Yeah.  But Ben's couple never got things going, and it got progressively worse as the day went  on.  The other couple's just going at it like rabbits all over the city.  Ben's couple, just sitting there drinking because the guy couldn't perform in the ATM 
[02:37:30]  the first time he tried.  No, and he would try.  Well, that was the whole thing.  He was like, I think I need to relax.  So he had a drink, smoked some weed, and we continued to do this, and it just never  worked.  Is this the clip where there's just really sad music in the background, and the guy's just  drinking away his sorrows, and the girl's really frustrated?  No?  Didn't get that far yet.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Ben's couple, not even on the scoreboard.  Not on the scoreboard yet.  Ben.  What's up, guys?  All right.  What's going on?  Well, we're in a theme restaurant.  We found a really good secluded area, and Mike's having a lot of problems. 
[02:38:00]  We had a couple drinks, and he's just still having a lot of problems.  He's still having problems?  Still, he did some shots.  He had a couple drinks, but just trying to loosen up.  See, unlike other sporting events, drugs and alcohol, we don't care if our contestants  use them.  Yeah, yeah.  There's going to be no drug testing.  No drug testing on the Sex Olympics.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Sex for Sam. 
[02:38:30]  Unbelievable spot.  I mean, we found the best spot in this restaurant, and just no luck whatsoever.  I cannot believe the problems Mike is having.  He seemed so confident.  He's so bummed, too.  He's like whacking his head.  He's just all pissed off.  Well, you know something?  After a while, this snowballs, and it gets harder and harder.  Well, not harder.  It gets more difficult and more difficult to get the job done because of the psychological  pressure coming into play.  Well, let's talk to Mike and Sharon.  Yeah.  Let's get Mike on the phone. 
[02:39:00]  Okay, here he is.  Hello?  Mike, what seems to be the problem?  I'm sorry?  What seems to be the problem, Mike?  I really don't know.  I really don't know.  No one ever admits it, but I really haven't had this problem before.  Yeah.  I guess just being out and about, and there's people in cabs next to us.  Yeah, that's where the problem of pressure comes into play, maybe a little shy.  I think so.  You know, the funny thing is, she's the shy one.  I beg for this.  That makes me look totally foolish. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, well, you know something?  Put it out of your mind.  Let me see if I can help him out a little.  All right.  Put it out of your mind.  That was good that you did a couple of shots or a couple of drinks.  Loosen up a little.  Well, concentrate on the world that is right around your girl, right around Shannon.  Don't think about anything to your peripherals.  Just look at her, concentrate, and go to town.  All right.  Hopefully, that'll help you, Mike, and get some points on the board.  I'm looking to score.  Mike, you're still in the hunt. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  You are.  Hunt.  I'm glad to hear that.  That definitely helped.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.

Time to play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Tony.  Hi.  I learned two things today.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  I learned that flying camels, they're funny.  Flying camels equals funny.  Very good.  I learned that people love crap on the radio, on TV, and on their Pasadena mudslide.  Yes.  Bravo.  Simication sucks.  No, we love the simication.  Come on.  Took so long to get here.  Kirk, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  Today I learned when my girlfriend gives me that look, it's called a fish eye.  A fish eye.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  I'm going to listen to myself on the radio.  All right.  Cool.  Like a dog's eyes.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:42:00]  Brian.  Hello.  Hey, Brian.  What did you learn on the show?  It's Brad, man, from Delaware.  Hey, Brad.  Oh, I learned that Comedy Central was a fan of the Red Rocket.  Yeah, that was an unbelievable episode.  Hey, man.  You guys told me a good thing about the work day, man.  Take it easy.  Hey, thank you very much.  I gave her the fish eye once, came up behind, slipped her the shocker.  She turned around, looked into her eye.  It was a black eye, lifeless eye, like a doll's eye. 
[02:42:30]  And then I kept pounding and pounding, and there was that high pitch screaming and hollering.  Hey, Paul, you're next.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  I learned that South Park ripped off Jim Norton.  Oh, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Oh, jeez.  Here comes the Olsen twins.  No penetration.  No violation.  All right.  There you go.  See you guys live.  Cool.  Here's the line he's talking about.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  Oh, no.  Where's the bucket of AIDS?  That was one.  That's a classic Norton line. 
[02:43:00]  By the way, we said it earlier.  If you haven't checked out South Park lately, they have lost their effing minds, and you  really should see the episode they had on last night.  They'll run it a couple times, as you know.  How about a nice bucket of AIDS?  There you have it.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy learned today on the show that Jesse Camp is the Jar Jar Binks of MTV, Anthony.  Oh, that's right.  Mesa going to be on their 20th anniversary?  Bye-bye.  Kathy writes, today I learned I have to walk around New Brunswick to find out where Louis 
[02:43:30]  Black is playing tonight.  Where is he?  The Stress Factory?  Yes, it's the Stress Factory.  Yeah.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Mesa needs a job.  Jersey Gary.  Coming up with great stuff every day lately.  Never, never use the hot tub at the hotel after a Star Trek convention or gay week at  Disney unless you like egg drop soup.  I also learned the new special at Paisano's on Mulberry Street is the Roman War Helmet.  You ask Joey.  And those of us who like ONA just love crap. 
[02:44:00]  I learned Louis Black killed Chandra Levy and buried her in a parking lot.  Yes.  Rick's freaking out about Sex for Sam, too, which happens tomorrow.  You need a couple more couples, Rick?  Yeah, we need more.  Let's get more couples.  Let's have more people having sex in New York, for Christ's sakes.  This won't be a complete failure tomorrow, will it?  I hope not.  That didn't sound convincing.  Thank you.  It's your head if it is, Rick.  Might be too late to get more couples, no? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, never too late.  All right, you're going to be teamed up with Marco and doing the goddamn bit yourself.  Put it that way.  Coffee, tea, or me?  Where every stop is the two points.  Yikes.  Ron learned that some black people don't like black people because they're not black enough,  and some gay people don't like gay people because they're too gay or not gay enough.  Right.  You did learn that, right here. 
[02:45:00]  That does amaze me, though.  That's something I learned recently.  Inter-gender, race, and sexual racism.  Whatever the hell it is.  Turkish.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I learned Gary Connett should have got her drunk and threw her in the pool.  And I learned Louis Black is an anti-Semite.  Ah, very good.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe.  That's insane, Joe.  Hey, what did you learn?  I learned that drugs make the music, and I learned that Colonel Mustard killed Sandra 
[02:45:30]  in the study with the candlestick.  Very good.  Later, guys.  Thank you, rule.  Thank you.  Thank you, does rule.  I'm expecting him to run in and do his woo.  Yes.  Hey, Paul.  What did you learn today?  Hey, I learned that Dead Bill references are always funny.  And Opie, you're definitely the mean one for that.  Dead Bill references.  We love Dead Bill references.  Oh, no.  All right, thanks, Paul.  All right, take care.  We don't have to play that anytime soon, do we?  No, I think after we pick up a few more markets, maybe in the very near future, they're called cities. 
[02:46:00]  Cities, Opie?  The markets get really pissed if you call them markets.  When we pick up some new ones.  Some new cities.  Some new cities.  Some new towns.  It'll be new to just about all of them.  What?  I hate when we play the Bill's Dead thing.  Jennifer.  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[02:46:30]  Hey.  Hey, I learned today, I learned the weather forecast for the rest of the United States for the next couple of months.  What's that?  It's going to be raining men, my friends.  It's raining.  Woo!  She did the woo.  All right, guys, take care.  All right.  Have fun.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  To some cities, it'll be like a retrospective.  I know.  Come on.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hey.  Big.  He tries every day.  Every day. 
[02:47:00]  All right, Anthony, we've got to get out of here.  Tomorrow is Sex for Sam 2.  Yes.  Jim Cook will be in the studio.  And we're going to have a lot of fun with that.  I can't wait.  It's always so much fun when he's in.  And Rick needs a few more couples to call.  Right?  Couples call.  Call now.  Call me now.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  We'll see you all tomorrow.  Thank you.  Daddy, touch my dirty place.  This is what we do every day.  We just get teenage girls naked. 
[02:47:30]  Anthony.  What are we going to do next?  We go to schoolyards and sell ecstasy.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony, goldenpalace.com.
