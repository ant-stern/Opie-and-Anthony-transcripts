<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony after-show, hosted by Sam Roberts, opened with a mention of CM Punk and Dan Soder (as Macho Man Randy Savage) having previously contributed to the show's intros.  The hosts launched into a scathing critique of *Silver Linings Playbook*, deeming it overrated and questioning its Oscar nominations, particularly the supporting actress nomination. This segued into a broader Oscars discussion, offering predictions and opinions on nominees like Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Daniel Day-Lewis.  The conversation frequently detoured, touching on a planned comedic fart stunt involving Bobo and Jimmy, allegations of racism against George Lucas, a comparison of the cinematic portrayals of mental illness and intellectual disabilities, and the excessive use of the N-word in *Django Unchained*.

A substantial portion of the show focused on complaints regarding Sal, the phone screener, whose mumbling and abrupt treatment of callers were heavily criticized by both the hosts and callers themselves. This criticism extended to other show staff failings and the lack of interns.  Other bizarre tangents included Linda Ronstadt's alleged transformation into a pig and discussion surrounding DJ Who Kid's success. Bobo participated via phone, offering uninformed opinions on the Oscars and nominated films.  The possibility of William H. Macy appearing on a future show was mentioned, and a commercial break for Stephen Singer Jewelers occurred.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts engaged in numerous humorous exchanges and made various off-color jokes and comments.  The entire show was peppered with these shifting topics, creating a chaotic and rambling, yet characteristically Opie and Anthony, broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is CM Punk, and you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts.  As if you didn't already know that.  Thank you, CM Punk.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  We should get more people to do those.  So far, we only got CM Punk and Dan Soder to do them. 
[00:00:30]  And Dan's not even himself.  No, he's doing Macho Man.  Oh, Tarantino did one.  He did? I didn't get it then.  Troy sent it to me.  But I think Tarantino just said, you're listening to Sam Roberts.  I think that way I can use that forever.  Use it on Sunday, too?  Sunday? I mean, I'm looking forward.  You know what I'm saying?  You can take that with me.  That goes in my back pocket.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW.  Well, if you learn something on today's Opie and Anthony show, it's a very educational show. 
[00:01:00]  We learn a lot about Bobo.  We learn a lot of stuff.  I can't believe...  What, Sal?  I learned that Jimmy's going to fart on Bobo.  Yeah, yeah.  And get tickets in return.  Bobo wanted Jim to fart on him for WrestleMania tickets.  So that's going to be cool.  Jim's going to get to see WrestleMania.  I can't believe this Silver Linings playbook is nominated in every category at the Oscars.  I saw that movie.  It was alright.  Right?  It's just an alright movie.  It was alright.  The acting was shit, but the dialogue was okay.  It's fine. 
[00:01:30]  The movie's completely fine.  But it's not good.  It's not great.  No.  Like, it was nice looking at Jennifer Lawrence's ass in dance pants for like an hour and a half.  Yeah, she's pretty funny.  But beyond...  It doesn't sound...  It doesn't sound real when you say it's out.  Don't even try.  It doesn't say...  It just sounds weird and like you're putting something on.  Nobody wants to hear that.  Yeah, it's very forced.  Thank you, you rock.  But it wasn't like nothing about that movie.  I didn't even leave wanting to see it again, let alone thinking it deserved... 
[00:02:00]  It wasn't the best movie of the year.  It wasn't the best directed movie of the year.  It wasn't the best written movie of the year.  Bradley Cooper didn't act in it better than anyone else.  Jennifer Lawrence didn't act in it better than anyone else.  Neither did Robert De Niro or whoever the old lady was.  The old lady got nominated for best supporting.  For what?  De Niro's wife...  What does she do?  I don't know.  She plays the mom.  She wasn't even in the movie that much, so...  That's right.  She's a supporting actress.  It was awful.  It wasn't a good movie.  I think if you put De Niro in a film, they naturally are like, oh, we have to honor it. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, really?  I didn't see Meet the Fockers getting honored.  I didn't see Rocky and Bullwinkle, as Opie brought up earlier, getting honored.  I think everybody knows at this point Robert De Niro is in it for them.  Checks.  Machete didn't get honored.  Machete was a better movie than Silver Linings Playbook.  Machete should have gotten honored.  But no, you got Silver Linings Playbook, and...  Machete was this year?  No, but it wasn't nominated a couple years ago when it came out.  Okay.  They're doing Machete Kills.  They're making the sequel.  Nice.  Lady Gaga's in it.  It's her first acting. 
[00:03:00]  Her first movie that she's doing is Machete Kills.  Is she gonna be naked in a pool like Lindsay Lohan?  That was a fake Lindsay Lohan, though.  Yeah.  They've got a body double to do the nudity.  She only does nudity in classy movies, like that movie where she played the twin strippers  or whatever.  I Think I'm Dead or something like that.  I Killed Me.  I Think I Know Killed Me.  I thought you meant like The Parent Trap.  Yeah, that's what it was.  It was a pole dancing scene in The Parent Trap.  But yeah, that movie wasn't good.  And they did this thing where I guess because it's about bipolar disorder and that's the 
[00:03:30]  new thing, like mental illness is the new retard, that it becomes this thing that everybody  pays attention to.  But like I know bipolar people.  There's no way mental illness at the end of the day is that charming.  Like you know what happens?  A bipolar love story is these two realize, these two start falling in love with each other  and they become obsessed with each other.  And then they both realize they're going through manic episodes and they end up beating the  shit out of each other or something.  Nothing.  It doesn't tie up in a nice bow at the end like it does for De Niro and the fam. 
[00:04:00]  It's ridiculous.  They emphasize the point so much.  You know they have bipolar, right?  Yeah.  Both?  Both of them.  They're crazy.  And now they're in love with each other.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's a terrible movie.  And see, and this is what happened.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but now that it's being praised like this, I say now it's  terrible.  Now it's awful.  Because now all this praise has soured me on it. 
[00:04:30]  I thought it was okay.  And now I'm completely soured on it.  It's the same thing that happened with Crash.  Although I didn't like Crash.  I really didn't.  I never liked Crash.  I thought it was stupid.  It was pretty fucking stupid.  And I know Jim likes it a lot.  Really?  He loves that movie.  I've had a couple conversations with him about it, but I hated that movie.  And then when it got all these Oscars, I just got upset.  Let's go to 570.  You're on after Opie and Anthony live.  How you doing, Sam?  Jay and Tampa.  Sorry about the voice.  That's okay, Jay.  It sounds sexy.  Anyway, I learned today that Anthony is not very observant. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  We started the show today with Opie saying, I'm missing something.  What's wrong with me?  And it took Ant about 10 minutes before he realized Opie wasn't wearing headphones.  Mars forgot to put Opie's headphones out.  Show is falling apart.  Yesterday, it was E-Rock not giving any prep sheets to anybody, so they just sat there  and said, hello, everyone.  Every day, something new.  Yeah.  Today, it was Mars with no headphones.  I'm telling you, us as a staff, and I'm including myself, we are making ourselves look more and 
[00:05:30]  more obsolete every day.  Like, the more we do nothing and just sit there and not do the basics and then brush it off,  like, oh, you guys are fine, makes them realize that, yes, they are indeed fine.  They don't need a staff.  As long as they have one of those Homer Simpson bird.  You remember when Homer Simpson was working from home?  Oh, the bird that drinks the water?  Right.  And he just...  Just pressing the any key?  Pressing the Y key.  Just Y.  That was the joke.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  That's all they need.  They need a bird that drinks water in there to hit the button when they need it to.  And that's it.  But we've tricked them into thinking that they need us, too.  Although, I'm greatly needed to host this after show.  William H. Macy just walked by.  I guess four days a week.  Oh, yeah.  William H. Macy may or may not be a guest on this Sunday's Sam Roberts show.  Wow.  Isn't that a coincidence that he's going to be here and Sunday?  Now and Sunday.  631. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, hi, Sam.  How are you?  Good.  I learned that George Lucas is a closeted racist.  I don't know if he's a racist.  He's marrying a black woman.  You never know what could happen.  That's true.  You never know what could happen.  And this lady doesn't leave the toothpaste cap on tight.  Who knows what comes out of that man's mouth?  He did create Jar Jar Binks, after all.  If that's not a racist character, I don't know what it is.  3-1-2.  Hey, Sam.  Scrambler, Chicago.  What's up, buddy?  Do you think that the silver lining playbook, like the mental health issue, kind of, you 
[00:07:00]  think like, I don't know.  It's like a make people aware kind of thing.  They feel good about themselves for nominating it.  Yeah.  Like that's Hollywood's cause du jour this year.  Like with the year Crash won, they were getting, you know, everybody, they wanted everybody  to pay attention to race and all this stuff.  Now mental illness is the big thing.  And of course, and you know, with everybody bringing it up involving the shootings and  all that stuff, it's becoming a thing.  This year mental illness was a big thing. 
[00:07:30]  And so they've just decided to shower every award conceivable with this movie that has  something to do with mental illness.  Yeah.  I think that's exactly what it is.  And there's, I never like a movie that gets nominated in every category.  There's no way any movie could be that good.  I mean, how could...  Even the best movie can't be everything.  Yeah.  You gotta be, you know...  Like, like, even your very favorite movie, even supporting actor, even that little character, 
[00:08:00]  that guy was that good?  I don't think so.  Spread the wealth.  Thank you, buddy.  You think The Ringer would have been nominated had it come out this year?  What's The Ringer?  The Johnny Knoxville movie.  Oh, about the Special Olympics?  Special Olympics?  Yes.  Yes.  I think 100%.  But that was about, like, retards, not about people who have mental illness, right?  I'm telling you, Iraq, you pay attention to me and watch what happens.  Mental illness is the new retardation.  They're gonna remake What's Eating Gilbert Grape, except it's gonna be like a bipolar schizophrenic 
[00:08:30]  instead of, like, you know...  Does the mom still die?  Yeah, the mom's gonna die, of course.  Rosie O'Donnell's gonna do, like, my sister on the bus, except she's gonna be lighting the  bus on fire, because she has mental illness.  She's not retarded.  As the bus goes speeding into a mall.  Exactly.  They gotta have a little action.  Gotta get those Hollywood dollars.  205, you're on the show.  Hey, Sammy.  Jim from Alabama.  How's it going, buddy?  I learned today that Sal's pretty much giving up on the phones. 
[00:09:00]  When he's in studio, you can understand him.  Mm-hmm.  But when you call the show, it's a barely audible, mumbling licknob.  And then when you tell him, I can't understand what you're saying, he fucking hangs up on you.  He hangs up on you because you don't know...  It's the worst ever.  All he's gotta do is answer the phone and be like, hey, it's the O.B. and Anthony show.  And now that he's, like, a mini-celebrity for terrible reasons, people might be like, hey, it's Sal.  You're that fucking idiot.  You know, something like that.  What's the problem with this guy?  Basically, what happens is, when you're screening calls, you just mumble. 
[00:09:30]  You go, like, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, what's your name?  And they go, what'd you say?  I can't understand you.  And you're like, I don't have time for this shit.  And you hang up on them.  I mean, that's certainly a possibility.  Why?  Because if the phones are blowing up, I need someone who's attentive and awake and who's gonna respond right away.  Why don't you be attentive and awake?  I am.  No, he just...  Sorry, buddy.  He just said...  The caller's still on the phone.  He just said that you're not attentive and awake.  That you're mumbling and people don't know what you're saying.  Well, what was the call that he had that was... 
[00:10:00]  You were chewing on your tongue.  Okay.  Don't chew on your tongue when your phone's screening, Sal.  I said, I can't understand you.  I said, look, I've got another proposition, another deal for, uh, for Jimmy with Bobo.  And you went...  I said, what?  He sounded exhausted by it?  I don't understand you.  Why wouldn't you let him through?  He's got another deal for Jim and Bobo.  That was a thing.  Oh.  Bobo's on the phone.  I'm gonna get to him in a second.  Not a great phone screener.  Okay.  All right.  Well, the only people you can tell us that are the callers. 
[00:10:30]  They're the ones you interact with, right?  Yeah, they're all...  They're all crazy.  Every caller's crazy?  No, there's...  There's some callers that will...  They'll have a call that's just genius.  Mm-hmm.  And it'll actually, like, genuinely make me laugh.  Mm-hmm.  But 99% of the time, it doesn't happen.  You hear that, guys?  All you out there listening to this show, calling in, you're not making Sal laugh.  You gotta step up your game.  You're not impressing Sal.  Because the thing is, if the phones are blowing up...  And you know what happens when Sal's not impressed?  He doesn't come.  So that's something you need to work on. 
[00:11:00]  No, but if the phones are blowing up, and I say, O&A, O&A, who's this?  And I do it a few times, I'm hanging up on you.  There's no way I'm gonna wait there.  But what if they can't understand what you're saying?  What if they're like, I don't know what you're saying?  You're like, ah, no.  Never mind.  Yeah, pretty much never mind.  The problem can't be mine.  The problem's yours.  When O&A needs to take the call, the person needs to be on point, like, ready to speak  right away, not friggin...  Like, if I knew we were gonna have this issue, we would put Roland on the phones.  That's why we don't put Roland on the phones.  People don't know what you're saying.  You're okay with that.  I know.  I hang up on people, too.  Right.  You just hang up on people.  You're not interested in a good call or a bad call. 
[00:11:30]  All I hear is, hi, this is, I just hang up.  I've got enough of you.  505.  You're on after O&A and Anthony Live.  Hey, this is Josh.  What's up, Josh?  Actually, I have two things now.  The first one, I don't know what it matters, what he says when he answers the phone.  It's been the same thing for years.  It's always O&A, who's this?  So what the fuck difference is it with what Sal says to him?  That's true.  For everybody out there, here's a little lesson.  No matter what Sal says to you when he answers the phone, just tell him what your name is,  where you're from, and what you'd like to talk about on the show. 
[00:12:00]  You have no idea how...  And you could throw in, like, at the end, you throw in a little, by the way, Sal, you're  a fucking idiot.  That's fine.  Something like that.  I would be completely fine with that, but the problem is no one does that.  And everyone goes, yeah, I'm calling in to talk about, to comment on that.  Yes, I fucking know that.  Just tell me your name, tell me where you're from, and the quicker you tell me exactly what  you want to say, and not in a, you know, three-page essay form, in a sentence.  Of course.  It's got to be quick, concise. 
[00:12:30]  Sal's not going to break down your shit.  And then you can get through quicker.  It's that simple.  All right.  What's your second point?  Going back, on a Simpsons episode, where's the any key on a keyboard?  Yeah, where's the any key?  I don't see any any key.  Let's go to 352.  Or 325.  Oh, shit.  Now he's not even screaming.  This is better.  I'm Bob from Texas.  Yeah.  I learned that Linda Ronstadt turned into a fucking pig later in life.  She did.  I didn't know that. 
[00:13:00]  That was a shame.  Yeah.  Google Imager, 2012.  Do I learn today?  Yeah.  Some of their Oscar picks were way off.  What did you think of the Oscar picks, Roland?  You're a big movie guy.  It's going to be Hugh Jackman for Best Actor.  Over Daniel Day-Lewis?  Yeah.  No, it won't.  I bet you.  How much?  Ten bucks.  All right.  Let's do a $10 bet.  A lunch.  Because it's a lunch.  Okay.  We'll do a lunch.  You're going Hugh Jackman.  Hugh Jackman over Daniel Day.  Can I say anybody but Hugh Jackman?  Yeah.  Okay.  So it's Hugh Jackman. 
[00:13:30]  And if Hugh Jackman wins, I owe you lunch.  Lunch.  Yeah.  If Hugh Jackman loses, you owe me lunch.  Yeah.  Because basically.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because he's just playing.  It's like when Ray with Jamie.  He just plays the same character.  I think.  It's like an impression.  But nobody knows what.  There's no audio or video of Lincoln.  I know.  But still.  How can you do an impression of Lincoln?  Four score.  Seven years ago.  It's acting.  That's like saying.  You know.  What's his name?  Wolverine went to see Les Mis on Broadway. 
[00:14:00]  He did.  And did an impression of the actor in the play.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Roland's going off the impression done on Bill and Ted.  Yeah.  Be excellent to each other.  Now that's an Oscar performance.  And.  Party on!  Who knew that his voice was not that deep?  I love Les Mis though.  You do.  That's why.  It's just a favorite of yours.  Yeah.  And Hathaway will win too.  You think so?  Oh yeah.  I think she'll win Best Supporting.  Definitely won't be that bitch in Silver Linings Playbook. 
[00:14:30]  Did you see that movie?  No.  But she's.  She's still young though.  You would like.  No.  No.  No.  It's the older woman.  Jennifer Lawrence got nominated Best Actress.  Not Supporting Actress.  I think she won't win that.  No.  She was not going to win that.  It'll be Jessica Chastain.  Chastain.  Chastain.  Whatever.  She'll win.  She's awesome though.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is me.  Bobo.  All right.  Bobo.  I'm glad you're finally on.  What did you think?  Yeah.  I mean it was a little controversial.  The Oscars came out.  Ben Affleck not nominated for director. 
[00:15:00]  A lot of people thought Argo.  It did get nominated for Best Picture.  Not for Best Director Ben Affleck.  Yes.  Bobo.  What say you?  Oh.  I think.  I think he should have been nominated.  How did you find that film?  Did you find it.  Did you like it?  Did you think it was exciting?  Would you have preferred a little more historical accuracy?  What did you think?  I enjoyed it.  I don't mind if someone wants to like little.  Change a little thing.  I don't know.  A little poetic license.  Right.  Right.  I know about you and your poetic license.  What was your favorite part of the film? 
[00:15:30]  Well.  I don't really have a favorite.  Right.  Did you see it?  Or no?  Well.  I got.  I got to.  I got to see it.  You did?  Yeah.  I think he's thinking of the movie Hugo.  Are you thinking of Hugo or Argo?  No.  I'm thinking of Argo.  Argo.  Okay.  Okay.  Argo.  Go fuck yourself.  Right, Bobo?  I guess you could say that.  Double guns.  Double guns indeed.  There's a line in the movie.  Bobo did not see the film. 
[00:16:00]  It said throughout the film.  Well.  What about Les Mis, Bobo?  Were you surprised?  Do you think, after seeing Les Mis, do you think Hugh Jackman will take the award?  Do you think Roland is right?  Bobo, the movie expert for After Opie and Anthony Live.  I did not see.  So you think he will take it?  I did not see that movie.  Okay.  So he won't.  Bobo's on my side.  Bobo's saying he won't take it.  And Silver Linings Playbook, Bobo.  We started this show talking about my somewhat outrage over the fact that this average at best 
[00:16:30]  movie is nominated in literally every major category.  What do you think about that?  Well.  I don't know.  I think it's just ridiculous.  All right.  I don't know.  It's just, I think Hollywood just feels that they just need to just automatically give  it to the things.  Oh, it's about some sort of mental illness.  Just give it, just give it the nomination.  That's exactly right, Bobo.  I'm surprised.  You and I are lining up exactly the same there.  So I'm glad, I'm glad about that.  What movie do you think was snubbed this year, Bobo? 
[00:17:00]  I'm not sure if movie snubbed, right?  I didn't get to see, go see that many movies this year.  Right.  Did you, he thinks Wreck-It Ralph got snubbed.  Wreck-It Ralph, Bobo.  I think he got nominated.  What about, yeah.  I didn't even, I didn't even see that for animated.  You missed Wreck-It Ralph.  What got nominated for animated?  I think the only movie I went to see this year, I think, I can recall, I think the last  movie I went to see in the theaters was, uh, was the, was the Dark Knight Rises.  Dark Knight Rises. 
[00:17:30]  Snubbed.  A lot of people surprised that Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane did not get nominated for  either Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor.  Bobo, did you see that coming or did you think he would be nominated?  I thought he would be nominated.  I thought he did a good job as Bane.  I did too.  That's a, that's a very strange thing.  And what about this?  Anne Hathaway, that name pops up, but shocks the world.  It's for Les Mis.  Did we forget she played Catwoman?  Bobo, were you surprised that Catwoman was not the nomination for Best Supporting Actress? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I'm, I'm surprised about that.  Yeah, me too.  Me too, Bobo.  Me too.  Roland, are you surprised or did you think it was going to be Les Mis?  I, I was, I had a sneaky feeling.  You thought it, you thought it would be Les Mis.  I think the PR campaign was going, do you know what?  Did you catch the Avengers, Bobo?  Did you see that this year?  Yeah, I did.  Not one.  Roland, how many nominations for the Avengers?  Five.  Five?  No, I'm just kidding.  Hey, Dave, what was, what was the one nomination?  Uh, I just saw it, hang on a second. 
[00:18:30]  Effects?  Yeah.  What was the effects?  Um, Achievement and Visual Effects.  Yeah.  Nothing for Mark Ruffalo?  Nothing.  Huh.  Bobo, no Best Acting nominations for any of the Avengers.  I'm shocked, I thought they did a good job of portraying these iconic characters.  I'm shocked as well.  Or maybe he could save the money from not going to the movies and buying a better phone.  That's true, you could.  You could do that, Bobo.  What about Django?  Django got nominated Best Picture. 
[00:19:00]  Christoph Waltz for Best Supporting.  He could win that one.  He was awesome.  They love Christoph Waltz in Hollywood.  They do.  Bobo, do you think...  I didn't even get to go see Django yet.  I'm going to go see that this weekend.  Do you think that the amount of N-words used in that film will make the Academy say,  I don't know if it's Best Picture.  I think there's nothing wrong with that, right?  That's how they spoke at that time.  And if I know you, Bobo, an old phrase of yours has always been, there's nothing wrong  with an N-word, right?  Right. 
[00:19:30]  He's got it tattooed.  I'm not used in that contact, right?  No, I don't.  That's right.  He's got it tattooed like Tupac's Thug Life.  Right across his abdomen.  And Bobo's right.  You do have to make sure the word is used in the right contact.  Yeah, that was.  They used that word like crazy at that time.  Yeah, sure.  So they're just using it the way it was used at the time.  That's the contact of the movie, so of course you used the word, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  What got nominated for Best Animated?  Best Animated Brave, Paranorman, The Pirates, Band of Misfits, Wreck-It Ralph, and Frankenweenie. 
[00:20:00]  Ice Age.  Snubbed.  Yeah, but that wasn't the original.  Ice Age 4.  It was great.  They were pirates.  Did you see it?  Bobo, can you believe Ice Age 4 not nominated for Best Animated?  I can be surprised, right?  I like John Licuizano as a...  That's right.  John Licuizano's acting. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, and he's only using his voice, which is incredible.  And Dennis Leary does well in all the Ice Age movies.  Ray Romano.  Ray Romano.  Really a lot of shockers.  Plus, did Nicki Minaj get nominated for Best Supporting for Ice Age 4?  Did you check that, Eric?  No, she did not.  She didn't?  Roland, I thought you said Nicki Minaj a favorite for Best Supporting.  Yeah.  Bobo, can you believe that?  Oh, I can't believe that.  Quite a lot of shockers. 
[00:21:00]  What do you think, Bobo, was the biggest shocker about this year's Academy Awards?  I'm not sure there wasn't anything that was really a big shocker.  There wasn't the Batman shockers?  I don't usually watch these awards shows so much.  This year, I'm kind of watching because of Seth MacFarlane's hosting.  For you, is he hosting the award show or did he host the nomination?  He's doing both.  He's doing both.  What a slut.  How do you do both?  You're not supposed to... 
[00:21:30]  If you're the guy, you're not supposed to do the warm-up show.  Like, that would be like if I was hosting the main show and the after show.  Right?  Well, he is Seth MacFarlane.  Can you believe that, Bobo, can you believe that Ted did not receive one nomination?  I can't believe it, all right?  Seth MacFarlane's freaking excellent in that movie.  The guy's a freaking genius.  He's a machine, isn't he?  Yeah, exactly.  No, Bobo, that's wrong.  He's a bear. 
[00:22:00]  You obviously did not see the film.  No, I know Ted's a bear.  Oh, okay.  I know Ted's a bear.  As a matter of fact, they got proof by seeing the movie.  Oh!  I will sing the Thunder Buddy song for that movie.  Please do.  All right.  When you hear the sound of thunder, just say these magic words.  Fuck you, thunder.  You can suck my dick.  You can't get me thunder because you're just got spots.  Bobo, I want to thank you for your call today.  You were great.  You were great.  Thanks.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  What a thespian. 
[00:22:30]  Bobo.  Did you say lesbian or thespian?  Thespian.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's Bobo, everybody.  The new movie guy for after Opie and Anthony Live.  We'll go to...  You like how he just forgot why he called in the first place?  You confused him to a point.  He's like, I don't even know why I'm calling him anymore.  Right.  He's just talking about...  Sam, we got something to say.  They're like, well, what do you like about Argo?  Well, Argo...  He didn't see Argo.  Robert in Birmingham.  Yeah, hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy? 
[00:23:00]  First, let me say that I hate Bobo's fucking guts.  However, having said that, I think you've got a new segment on the show that you have Roland take Bobo to these screenings.  And he comes back, he does a full review, and he gives it however many misshapen penises rates.  Yeah.  Like, how many Bobo-ners do you give it?  Yeah.  And it will be horrendous.  And it'll make me want to poke my eyes out.  But it'll be funny.  And by the way, Sal's a dick.  Thank you very much, Robert. 
[00:23:30]  That was a perfect phone call.  He said, uh, Roland, do you think you can get Bobo into some screenings?  Yeah, I'm not going to put my neck off for that guy.  All right, well, then maybe what we'll do is we'll just ask him to go see movies.  We should take him to the theaters that have the old matinees.  Or, like, years ago.  Yeah, take him to see older movies.  Yeah, like movies that have been out for a year.  What did you think of Big?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I didn't see a cubby when he turned back into a kid.  Or would you just tell him it's a premiere?  Has he covered it?  Like, I'd say him on a Friday night.  He won't know the difference.  He won't.  He won't.  You're right, Roland. 
[00:24:00]  I'll buy him popcorn.  Brandon in Kansas.  Brandon.  Hi, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  How's it been going?  Good.  Okay, Heather.  All right.  I'm going to go ahead and hang up on you.  He was probably about to compliment me.  He sounded like he was about to say something nice.  I think he sounded like he was going to say something racist.  But, yeah, he was all fucked up.  So, you know.  It happens.  I mean, his opinion was his opinion.  Hey, Sam, I got to tell you something about these.  Opinions are like assholes.  They all stink. 
[00:24:30]  Paul on Long Island.  Good morning, Samuel.  Hi, Paul.  I learned on the show that if you call the phone screener repeatedly and insult him, you  threaten to block your phone number.  He doesn't have the technology to block your phone number.  Then I guess I could continue to call him and harass him then.  Do you harass our phone screener?  Well, only when it's Sal because he's a non-coming faggot.  And he doesn't go into the office and call you at home?  That's weird.  So, how often... 
[00:25:00]  Who would do that?  How often do you call Sal?  Just, you know, when I feel like insulting him, you know?  Just when you want to get something off your chest.  That's great.  Sal is like a stress ball for the audience of the show.  Like, all Opie and Anthony channel listeners, you could look at Sal like a stress ball.  Like, you know, you've got to squeeze it when you're just feeling like,  ah, I've got the weight of the world on my shoulders.  Well, instead, call up Sal.  Tell him what an asshole he is, you know?  It feels great, really.  I recommend it.  I call him.  If he's listening now, which I'm sure he is, 
[00:25:30]  Sal, you're an asshole!  Thank you, Paul.  It feels great.  Can you hear that?  Okay.  Did Sal...  Somebody called you an asshole.  Can we get some confirmation?  Did Sal hear...  He did.  Yeah.  What did he say about that?  He said, yeah, I heard it.  That's it?  What's his opinion?  What's your opinion?  It's fine.  Okay.  You want to know why I didn't mind it?  Why is it?  Because when he called up, he gave me his name and where he was from,  and he gave me the full statement, and I put him on hold right away.  That's all you need?  That's all I need.  You could say whatever the fuck you want to me.  I don't care.  Do we have interns coming back? 
[00:26:00]  No, because someone dropped the ball on that.  Who dropped the...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Eric, did you drop the ball on the interns?  Was the printer jammed?  Yeah, because Sal is leading me to believe that the reason we don't have any interns right now,  because obviously it's between semesters.  Anthony was our sole surviving intern from last semester.  He left before Christmas, so we're down to just Sal as the phone screener.  That's why he's in there every day.  Yeah.  You dropped the ball on getting new interns? 
[00:26:30]  No, we got new interns.  They're just not allowed to start until later in the month.  Why is Sal blaming you?  Because Sal doesn't know what he's talking about,  so he thinks he's going to fit in with the guys by taking a shot at me.  Is that right, Sal?  No, no, no, hold on.  This is kind of awkward, though, because me and Eric have to share a mic in here.  But, uh, no, it was just Eric didn't...  Do we have to share a mic in here?  Now he's touching me.  Uh, Eric just didn't inquire early enough that we have this long delay of not having him.  Really?  We've only been running your dumb promo for three months.  He doesn't act well in the promo, does he?  No, in fact, you point that out in the promo. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  So the problem is that, Eric, that you didn't send the email quick enough?  No, I sent everything perfectly fine.  We approved people.  So where is Sal getting that information from?  He's making it up.  Sal, you make that up?  I'm making it up.  It's just that Eric should have asked to get the interns earlier.  He never asked, therefore they started normal time.  Well, in Eric's defense, other departments are not getting their interns until later on, too.  We got turned down for having them early, like we usually do.  This is the first time ever that it's happened.  Yeah, other departments got turned down, too. 
[00:27:30]  You did ask, Eric, and you got turned down.  Exactly.  Sal doesn't know what he's talking about.  No, not at all.  Well, Eric didn't tell me that.  Keep talking about nothing you know about.  Well, Sal gets put in his place again.  Speaking of getting put in your place, don't get put in your place.  Stephen Singer?  You got to know the inside scoop on what's going on.  The inside scoop is Stephen Singer.  Sorry.  My favorite thing is that he said, whoop, before he turned off the mic. 
[00:28:00]  I was writing down the Stephen Singer time.  Whoop.  Nagel style.  Here's the inside scoop.  Ro, this is what I was trying to give you.  All the hints, all the tips.  The inside scoop on Stephen Singer and Stephen Singer Jewelers.  Stephen is a genius.  I know you're sitting there going, no, he's not.  He's half retarded.  When it comes to helping you select the right gift for that special someone.  He's silver lining and retarded.  He's like Rain Man, Roland.  Like, this is his specialty.  He's not smart at most stuff. 
[00:28:30]  But when it comes to picking out the right gift, he's the man.  You messed up with your Christmas gifts, didn't you?  Don't worry about it.  Stephen will guarantee that you hit a home run for Valentine's Day.  Did you like that Foley?  I did.  Thank you, Roland.  I believed it.  He's got the perfect, you're looking around, where's that baseball?  He's got the perfect gift for Valentine's Day starting at only $69.  It's a real long stem rose dipped in 24 karat pure gold.  You ever heard about these?  They last forever. 
[00:29:00]  My mom loves them.  You'll get credit for this gift for a lifetime.  Roland's still getting credit from his mom.  Yeah.  Why talk about Valentine's Day so soon?

Or use that internet.  Go online to IHateStevenSinger.com.  I think the sound needs to listen to Blake Shelton's new song.  I think he needs to listen to the Thunder Buddies song again.  If you did.  The Thunder Buddies.  Do you have it?  Yeah.  You want to hear it?  When you hear the sound of thunder, you say these magic words. 
[00:30:00]  Fuck you, thunder.  You can suck my dick.  You can't get me thunder because you're just God's fucks.  I got to tell him one thing.  That Boston accent is untouchable.  He sounds like the Ted at the end of the movie when he's been retarded.  After he gets sewn back up.  That was a funny movie, Ted.  I loved it.  I mean, it was very much like, yeah, that's the voice he does.  Like, he only knows how to do the one family guy voice.  But I laughed. 
[00:30:30]  He'll probably use that a lot in the Oscars.  What?  Like, when he does the opening.  Of course.  He's only got the one.  I think my favorite Seth MacFarlane observation ever was Patrice O'Neill.  I mean, the wisdom that came out of Patrice O'Neill's mouth on every topic he talked about was untouchable.  But I think it was at the roast when he said,  Seth MacFarlane is jealous of his own cartoon characters.  When he said, and he's right.  Like, Seth MacFarlane is jealous that Family Guy is bigger than Seth MacFarlane is. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  You know how badly Seth MacFarlane just wants to be a standout guy on his own?  Because when he does Stewie, the crowd goes nuts.  That's all they want is Stewie.  Yeah, you could do a movie, but maybe, you know, Peter.  Like, I don't want to hear anything else.  He had to work that line into the dialogue of the movie.  Which line?  Remember, there was a party going on.  I think it's when they met the guy from Flash.  Oh, yeah.  From Flash Gordon.  Yeah.  And he said something along the lines of,  why does everyone keep thinking I sound like Peter Griffin?  Right. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Because.  He had to work it in.  Of course he did.  He was like, oh, if I explain it, then it's not like, you know, me whoring myself out.  This is a funny movie, though.  Chris in Nebraska.  Hey, Sal might be an asshole.  Yeah.  I don't think he's ever on air said he'd sell his wife's pussy to Anthony Cummio for money.  No, I didn't say, Chris, I didn't say that I would sell Anthony a night with my wife for $5 million.  I said I would consider it.  $5 million?  $5 million tax-free. 
[00:32:00]  $5 million in my hand.  Aunt will take care of the tax.  She'll get her dream home.  You know what I mean?  I said I would have a conversation with Jess about it.  For the $5 million?  Yeah.  Times are tough.  Okay?  I'll fuck Eric for $1 million.  You would fuck Eric for $1 million?  Yeah.  If we, Eric, would you allow, if we could get a million, uh, if we could get $250,000 for you, would you allow Roland to fuck you?  No, not if he's getting a million.  How much money would it take for Roland to fuck you?  A million?  Yeah, probably, at least a million. 
[00:32:30]  So a million in peace.  I got a house to pay for.  So, Steven Singer, we need $2 million from you, and Eric and Roland will fuck each other.  Throw in a couple of those roses, too.  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of pints of Haagen-Dazs and, like, a nice ball of rose.  If Steven Singer throws in some gold-dipped roses with the $2 million, Eric, will you take a couple up the ass?  Yeah.  With the roses?  No, just the stems.  Take a couple up the stems up the ass?  No, take a couple of the roses.  Like, take the roses themselves.  Yeah.  And Roland can put them in your asshole, but you get to keep the roses. 
[00:33:00]  For $2 million?  No, you get $1 million, and Roland gets $1 million.  Still, that's an attractive offer.  Right.  And, I mean, Roland's an attractive guy, so.  What's up?  Garth in Indiana.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  Goddamn, this show is fun.  Alright, dude.  So, please tell me for the fucking WrestleMania tickets that Bobo's supposed to win.  Please tell me that Jimmy's gonna do this butt-naked streak, fucking get some fecal matter on Bobo's face.  Bobo's not winning tickets.  Yeah, Bobo tripped up on his words a little bit.  I think that his goal was to win tickets. 
[00:33:30]  But the bit as it stands is, Jim is gonna fart on Bobo.  And then Bobo is gonna give Jim tickets to WrestleMania.  That's the bit, correct, Eric?  I believe so, yes.  Okay, yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  Fucking A.  Alright.  So, he may be naked.  Rich on Long Island.  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  What's up, buddy?  I thought Bobo was the fucking retard, but it's really fucking Sal.  I'm still waiting for my signed ribbon.  What?  Yes, I'm still waiting for that thing. 
[00:34:00]  Sal, you're a fucking idiot.  And, E-Roc, you rule.  Good.  Thank you, sir.  Good for you, Rich.  Me and DJ Who Kid signed one of my mother's ribbons before the holidays for you, Rich.  I know.  I'm still waiting for this fucking thing.  Sam, you may want to have Sal give you an update on that.  I know a douche.  What a douche indeed.  Yeah, Sal, can I have an update on that, please?  Yeah, it was before the break, right?  Like, the day before or two days before.  Of course.  It was a Christmas ribbon.  Why would it be here after?  I think Anthony put it in the office somewhere, and I'll just look for it today. 
[00:34:30]  Anthony, the intern.  Anthony, old intern, yes.  You'll look for it today?  I want a wow sticker with that fucking thing.  All right, we'll give you a wow sticker, sure.  And you hear this, Rich, though?  You've called about this before.  Yes, I have.  This is the third time I've called.  He's a fucking retard.  Right.  Sal says, I'll look for it today.  I'll look for it.  I don't promise I'm going to have it.  Dude, that's the fucking defeatist attitude I'm talking about.  When I was an intern, or when I was just starting out in my first couple years, still to this  day, god damn it.  How am I going to procure it if it doesn't exist?  You make it happen.  Or get something else, and then get re-signed. 
[00:35:00]  What did Yoda say?  There is no try.  There is do.  Seek?  Right.  Sounded just like him, Roland.  That was a fantastic impression.  You look kind of more like an Ewok, but you sound like Yoda.  Let's go to 336.  Hey, Sam.  I wanted to stick up for Sal.  Good.  It's starting to get really uncomfortable the way Opie is always beating him down.  I don't know how much of it, you know, just for the show, but it's just starting to get 
[00:35:30]  a little uncomfortable.  You can also, you can kind of tell at times, it's like, maybe Jimmy, you know, sticks up  for him, and even Ant some, but it's just...  Well, Jim and Ant feel, I mean, they don't like him.  They just feel bad for him.  But you're right.  And I think it started when we brought it up here on the after show that I was picking  up.  I was like, wait a minute.  Opie's going very hard on Sal.  Hard on.  And then all of a sudden, every day now, no matter what's going wrong, just yesterday,  E-Rock did not have the prep sheets for this show until 7.30 in the morning. 
[00:36:00]  The show had been going for an hour and a half by the time E-Rock brought his prep sheets  in.  Sal got yelled at for that more than E-Rock did.  Yeah, it was pushing.  It didn't matter what Sal did.  He was going after him.  I mean, it's...  Anyway...  You see it now.  Yeah, I do.  Absolutely.  Thanks, Sam.  All right, buddy.  I can't wait to see what happens with it.  I would like to see how Sal adapts.  How it affects him.  I want to know how Sal thinks he's going to get out of this rut. 
[00:36:30]  Because the bottom line is, there's two names on that wall.  50% of the people that are listed on that wall can't stand Sal.  Can't stand him.  What about SiriusXM?  SiriusXM goes with 50% of that wall.  So, you know what I mean?  If 50% of that wall doesn't like somebody, SiriusXM doesn't either.  It is what it is, Roland.  Eric, you've got to be happy that somebody's taking some of your shit, finally.  Like, you know, the shit that...  Because, like you said, shit gets rolled downhill. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And the rest of us, and by us, I mean specifically me, have figured out ways to just jump out of the way of the shit so it just hits you most of the time.  Yeah.  You, Eric, have come out of the trenches.  You're starting to avoid some of that shit and let it pile on top of Sal.  That's the way it goes.  It feels good, doesn't it?  I can see why you guys enjoy it for so many years.  You can.  Yeah.  You understand now.  You're more at peace with what we do to you.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Things are good.  Good. 
[00:37:30]  Have you seen WhoKid's Instagram of 11,000?  WhoKid's been in Vegas.  It's insane.  DJ WhoKid's over in Vegas for the CES convention.  And he's just been tweeting out pictures of him winning cash.  Is the company paying for him to be there?  I don't know, but yesterday.  He was 50 Cent and Tyson.  Yesterday he had an Instagram.  One Instagram picture was him hanging out with 50 Cent and Mike Tyson, like Roland just said.  And the next Instagram was him holding $6,000 in cash.  This one's $11,500.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to hang out with him more off the air.  What if we did another tournament?  Poker tournament?  Yeah, and had him be one of the celebrity guests.  Oh, my God.  He'd be a rock star there.  I love, I've loved watching the audience turn around on WhoKid.  Because at first.  The audience, the hosts.  The hosts, too, yeah.  Opie and Anthony, Anthony specifically, are going, who the fuck is this guy?  Why does Sam keep bringing him on the show?  This is not Shade 45.  This is not hip hop.  But give WhoKid a couple, give him an hour. 
[00:38:30]  And he'll win you over.  Every time.  Now all the channels want to get WhoKid on the air.  Have you heard about that?  Everybody wants a piece of WhoKid now.  Howard after Howard.  Howard.  How about everybody remembers?  Sammy.  Who brought WhoKid to all the white people out there?  I'm not saying I broke him.  I'm not saying I made him famous.  I didn't Carly Rae Jepsen him.  But, I mean.  I launched him into another plateau.  That's right.  That's exactly right, Eric. 
[00:39:00]  We've got a lot of stuff for tomorrow.  Do we say which guest is coming in?  Yeah.  David Duchovny coming back.  Yeah.  You're a huge David Duchovny fan.  I love David Duchovny.  California Cation is coming back?  Yeah.  Why do you like David Duchovny so much?  Fox Smulder.  Fox Smulder.  Mulder.  Is his last name Smulder?  Was he one of the guys that you dressed up?  Because Roland used to go to school.  Dressed up as his favorite characters.  He doesn't even really like wrestling.  Yesterday he told me that he once went to school in a hot rod t-shirt and a kilt. 
[00:39:30]  Is that a true story?  We need a photo.  Do you have any photos of you in costumes as a kid?  My mom may have them.  You used to dress up as Indiana Jones and go to school thinking you were cool.  Yeah, my brother just goes, you're a fucking idiot.  And then what would your classmates say?  My two best friends go, you're awesome.  And then the rest of the school disagreed.  And they pushed me down.  Would you ever dress up?  Now, Fox Smulder, though, how old were you when The X-Files was on?  I forget.  What year was that? 
[00:40:00]  It would have been probably...  I think it started like 93.  Yeah.  Yeah, going to high school.  Did you ever dress up as Fox Smulder in high school?  I wore a suit and everything, yeah.  With a tag?  No, I just wore the suit that he had.  You wore a suit to high school?  Yeah, I wore a suit every day.  That's some weird shit that you'd hear.  You're like that little kid in Modern Family.  Yeah.  I had some weird shit you'd hear about on the news later on.  And then people would be like, well, of course he went crazy.  He used to wear a suit and have people call him Fox every day.  Yeah, because they're like, look, it's Fox Smulder. 
[00:40:30]  And I thought we were awesome.  Were you?  Me and my three friends dressed in suits.  And were you guys awesome?  No, we were pointed at, laughed at.  Last call of the day, 509.  He hung up.  That's it for the calls.  We gotta go.  We gotta go.  Fox Smulder on the show tomorrow.  Bob Kelly tomorrow as well.  Oh, Bobby's gonna be here?  He'll be here.  Oh, and the Millionaire Matchmaker, I think, is gonna be on the after show.  Oh, yeah.  Patty Stanger?  That's Bravo, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it premieres tonight.  Oh, good.  So I'll watch it and then I'll talk to her about that.  Yeah.  Everybody watch that tonight. 
[00:41:00]  That's her homework.  So we can all experience the joy of the Millionaire Matchmaker when she's in here tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Make sure we give Sal some tips.  Yeah, we'll give Sal some tips.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
