<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of E-Rock's lateness, attributed to his girlfriend's emergency gallbladder surgery.  This led to a detailed, and highly inappropriate, recounting of a Lifetime movie plot (initially misremembered as featuring Tom Wopat, later corrected to Joe Penny) involving a dentist who rapes his patients.  The hosts shared anecdotes about hospital waiting rooms, including Anthony's experience watching more inappropriate Lifetime movies while waiting for his girlfriend's surgery.  The conversation also included a gruesome description of a cancer commercial with unintentionally funny background music, the absurdity of hospital waiting times, and a promotion for "Whip'em Out Wednesday," complicated by outdated promotional stickers. Listener calls were interspersed throughout.  Guests mentioned as potentially appearing later included Bob Kelly, Louis C.K., and a confirmed appearance by Maury Povich, with a preview of an upcoming segment about a person's phobia of cotton balls. The segment ended with a rapid-fire list of Lifetime movie titles.

The show continued with a humorous bit about a fictional Lifetime movie, "Your Baby Is Black," followed by listener-submitted ideas for Lifetime movies featuring their staff and various personalities (e.g., "A car battery for Fat Boy," "A bear in chaps," "A boyfriend, a Nazi").  This transitioned into irreverent and offensive jokes about the death of Phil Rizzuto, contrasting his arrival in baseball heaven with other deceased baseball figures like George Steinbrenner, Babe Ruth, and Thurman Munson.  The hosts then launched into an angry and highly offensive rant against Don Imus and Curtis Sliwa, filled with personal insults and mockery.

Maury Povich then joined the show in studio.  The discussion with Povich covered paternity tests, fear-confrontation segments (including the infamous "Cottonball, man" segment), and humorous anecdotes from his show.  The hosts and Povich discussed Povich's on-air persona versus his off-air personality.  Following Povich, Rob Zombie joined the show in studio.  The interview focused on his upcoming Halloween movie remake, his friendship with Tom Papa, Opie's admiration for Ozzy Osbourne and Malcolm McDowell, and discussion of Rob Zombie's work and casting choices.

A later segment revisited the Rob Zombie Halloween remake, featuring a call from a superfan, Sam, who had a Rob Zombie tattoo. The discussion included the movie's violence, scares, and cameo issue, compared to other horror films. Sam's extreme fandom and peculiar dietary habits were a running joke. The conversation shifted to a bizarre lawsuit against Michael Vick, detailed in a handwritten complaint with outlandish claims. Anthony then called in from his car, angrily describing his frustrating driving experience in New York and New Jersey with frequent expletives.  Jim Norton and Louis C.K. were also in studio during this portion.


A subsequent segment devolved into extremely crude and sexually explicit humor involving the hosts, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., and Bob Kelly.  The conversation included suggestive descriptions of sexual acts using props, a discussion of Bob Kelly's sexual fantasy involving a female program director, Tracy.  Tracy was then brought into the studio, resulting in flirtatious banter and sexually charged comments.  The segment also involved the promotion of a sex toy, the iVibe Rabbit, and a bizarre game involving used baby wipes, prompting disgust and vomiting from Bob Kelly.  Highly offensive language and sexually explicit jokes were pervasive throughout.

The final segment featured several loosely connected discussions. It began with a contest involving fecal matter, followed by a personal anecdote about a disturbing sexual encounter. The hosts then commented crudely on a news story about a father tased while holding his baby.  A phone segment featuring a vulgar exchange of insults and sexually explicit challenges for Velvet Revolver concert tickets followed.  The segment concluded with the announcement of a "line of the day," further discussions about Britney Spears, a promotion for a comedy event called "Car Crash Comedy," and a musical piece by Drew Boogie.  No guests were explicitly identified as being in studio during this portion, aside from the hosts and Drew Boogie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  Boom!  They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this there?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, the dramatic music has begun.  Oh.  That means you're going to hear something, boy.  I tell you.  Something important is going to happen.  What is going to happen?  Let's just sit around and wait and see what happens.  Oh, that means we have to make it happen.  Oh, isn't that odd?  Yeah, we can't just sit and go, all right, go.  Let's hear what happens.  Wouldn't it be great?  We just sit here and go, all right, something important is going to happen.  We've got to make it happen.  We just sit there and watch. 
[00:02:00]  We all just stare at the door for about three hours waiting for something important to happen.  Why isn't something happening?  Oh, we're responsible.  Oh, yeah.  We're the action stars.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, and that's us.  Someone jump out that window.  Oh, would that be great?  Bobby?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  877-212-ONA.  Ant just arrived.  It's one of those crazy days.  E-Rock just arrived.  Bob Kelly's here because we didn't think Anthony was going to arrive.  Louis C.K. might be here, but he might be here later.  Yeah, it was.  Please don't compare me with E-Rock being late also.  Like, Anthony's late.  E-Rock's late.  All right, why don't we take care of E-Rock first?  Same level of importance.  And same level of late every day.  I am promptly here every day.  Right.  You have a reason today. 
[00:03:00]  E-Rock, I don't know.  Maybe we should start the reason why E-Rock is late bit.  But it's official.  We do have a sweeper, so.  Oh.  E-Rock's late.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's late.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's late.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's late.  E-Rock.  on the Obi-N-Habby Show. 
[00:03:30]  He's just shaking his head.  He's just shaking his head over there.  Wake up, E-Rock.  Wake up.  No, you gotta get up.  Well, the guys behind the scenes 
[00:04:00]  have been keeping track of how late  E-Rock is every day. On a daily basis.  And it kind of came to a head today  because he called in with some kind of weird  problem. And we all just kind of laughed  because we're like, you're late every day. You're finally  calling today to tell us you're going to be late?  Wow. And then Tim ran into his  production room and made a sweeper, so  there you go. What happened to you, E-Rock?  What's the deal?  My car battery's dead.  I do absolutely nothing around here.  Oh, so you figured you could 
[00:04:30]  come in late. Thanks.  So your car battery's dead.  What year is your car?  It's 2001.  Yeah.  Yeah, that happens.  It's like a 1978 excuse.  Yeah.  My Gran Torino didn't start.  All right.  Card and start.  Was it completely dead or was it...  There's a couple of kinds of dead.  There's the...  And that's like there's a chance. 
[00:05:00]  And then there's this one.  Oh, that is the worst.  Which is pretty much you're screwed.  And then there's this one.  And that's real bad.  Just the click.  The nothing, the key turning.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  There's a problem.  That's almost better, actually.  When you're going through that whole process, though,  you're like,  I think I should...  I'm going to try it again.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Don't kill it. 
[00:05:30]  Okay.  If I pump the gas.  All right.  If I pump the gas.  I'm going to wait five minutes.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  You start yelling at the person.  Stop.  There's still a chance.  Then you just got to give it the shot.  I think you just got to give it the shot.  It always ends because you're being conservative.  You hear it, and you're like,  oh, man, I'm not ready to fully give it a shot. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just save a little.  And then, yeah, you just go nuts until it's just clicking.  Make sure everything's off.  Turn my radio off.  Turn my air conditioner off.  Everything's off.  Don't push down on the gas.  Max power to the engine.  You're going to flood it with gas.  Don't push down too much.  Flood it.  Of course, a car that hasn't been made that could be flooded since the 70s.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Flooded.  When was the last time your buddy had to go,  it's flooded.  You smell gas all around.  It's like a high school excuse. 
[00:06:30]  Damn it, flooded.  Pop the hood and hold down the choke.  You have to have a friend.  No, it's a special way.  Put your finger in there and keep the butterfly valve open in the choke a quarter of the way.  Boom.  Now you get like a pop of flames comes out of your carb.  Ah, the good old days.  And then it goes completely dead.  You're like, hey, you got jumper cables.  Jumper cables.  Cables.  What? 
[00:07:00]  You got to flag someone down.  Anyway, we got Kevin from Connecticut.  He writes, E-Rock should be woken up by the Buffalo rapist every morning.  Oh, God.  I'm not telling that story again.  With his hoodie on.  People, I'm not telling the story again.  I mean, you know, you're either in or not in on that joke.  Very good.  Kevin from Connecticut.  And then Matt, the therapist from South Carolina, writes,  Opie, it wasn't the car.  It was his brain.  Oh, did that need a jump start? 
[00:07:30]  So, E-Rock, do you feel good that you got a sweeper, though?  Not really.  I think it's kind of cool when Tim finally gives you a sweeper on this video show.  It's like a badge of honor.  What time did Eric get here?  How late was he?  Got here about 5.30.  So basically, it was only 10 minutes late today.  Yeah.  That's no big deal.  You got a jump?  No.  What happened?  It's still sitting there on the side.  On the side of what?  By the way.  Where I parked.  Oh.  Hey, by the way, what time did you say you got here? 
[00:08:00]  About 5.30.  Yeah, actually, you got here at 5.33 and 58 seconds.  They keep track every day.  They really do.  So it's 5.54, you round it up.  5.34, right.  5.34, sorry.  My girlfriend.  That was 5.54.  Anthony got here at 5.54.  I got here at 5.54.  Anthony got here 10 minutes ago.  So it was like a NASCAR event driving in today.  Oh, my God.  So I'm doing more traffic.  I'm doing the natural seg.  But your lateness has nothing to do with dummies lateness. 
[00:08:30]  So I'm on time, usually.  So what happened?  Well, my girlfriend had to have her gallbladder taken out.  It was inflamed and had gallstones in it.  It's like a little satchel of marbles.  Like a marble bag with Aggies in it.  So they had to do that.  Yeah.  And, you know, like I said, when you're on hospital time, it's just a whole different animal.  Hospital time in real time just doesn't. 
[00:09:00]  When someone goes, it's going to be a couple of minutes, usually.  Usually it's like a couple of minutes, five minutes, like that.  But the hospital's like, it's going to be a couple of minutes.  We're going to get right to the problem.  And then you're like, why are they moving in slow motion?  What happened?  Let me get the surgeon and he'll discuss things with you in about 16 hours. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  How do you do that?  Why?  Why does it have to be 16 hours?  He's got other patients to tend to and he does it very slowly.  I heard that on the replay.  I'm like, people are going to think we're just slowing down a tape or something.  That's actually Anthony.  That's how it sounds.  That's an amazing impression.  And you sit and wait.  So she was supposed to go in there at like, I guess, three o'clock. 
[00:10:00]  And they give you a beeper.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But you were supposed to do it Monday.  Oh, yeah, it was supposed to be Monday.  And then it was three o'clock yesterday.  What time did the surgery finally happen?  And it was three o'clock yesterday.  Well, they give you a beeper.  They give you a little beeper.  And say it's time?  Like you're waiting at like TGIF?  And that's what they said.  It's like Applebee's or something.  They give you a beeper.  The Cheesecake Factory or whatever it's called?  You go to the Cheesecake Factory.  You're sitting outside with your stupid big beeper?  Your beeper.  So they give you a beeper in the OR waiting room. 
[00:10:30]  So there's people there that are just like, you know, they're waiting for things as simple as, you know, my girl's operation is pretty routine.  Right.  The gallbladder thing.  And she's young and healthy, so it's not a big deal.  And then there's people sitting there with doom and gloom on their face waiting for the doctor to say alive or dead.  So it's just horrific to have to sit there.  So I didn't do it.  So wait, I've never been in the OR.  Oh, our waiting room is just.  Oh, wow.  There's like four rooms and there's all families sitting in each of the rooms. 
[00:11:00]  So some of those people are having that death surgery.  Dude, yes.  Remember that guy, that creepy guy that used to advertise on our show about the cancer of the neck, throat, eyebrows, eyelids?  We are here for stereotactic surgery for cancers of the neck, liver, chest, leg, goiter, tongue, eyeballs, hair.  Armpits.  Armpit.  Stereotactic radio surgery puts seat implants for prostate, leg, anal, and whatever cancer you have, we will try to take care of it. 
[00:11:30]  That was the guy that also did George Harrison and decided it was a good time when George Harrison had old pudding brain to go in and have his guitar sign.  So I think he had a little ethics problem there and now he's, you know, he's clipping toenails somewhere at an old age home.  And we were the problem.  Yeah, we were the problem.  And we were the problem back in the day.  We had to run these stupid commercials.  Because they had the cancer.  Piano music behind.  It was like.  It's like. 
[00:12:00]  Does a loved one have cancer?  Cancer of the neck.  Nostril.  Nostrils.  Back of head.  Tailbone.  He'd like list a bunch of places and you're like, I can't see for the tailbone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of the spine.  It's like, we all know what kind of cancer you get, but this guy like.  Oh, he came up with one.  And it's so many more to worry about.  Cancer of the teeth.  Cheeks.  Eyelids.  Nostrils.  Right.  Sinus.  Gums.  Yeah.  A little ball bag in the back of your throat. 
[00:12:30]  Adam's apple.  Yeah.  Fingernails.  Yeah.  Fingerprints.  Cancer of the fingerprints.  Is that even possible?  So, you know, so back in the day we're playing these commercials and Ant and I finally had it.  We're doing afternoon drive.  We're supposed to be happy and entertaining people.  So we take his stupid commercials and we start playing music behind him to like to see how the mood changes.  So we started playing like Benny Hill music as he's talking about these horrific cancer of the neck, head, chest. 
[00:13:00]  It was like, wow, OK, this is more of an upper.  And then we try.  Feels better.  I remember we tried porno music.  Porn.  Oh, it was everything.  We tried all sorts of different music beds.  And then, of course, a guy in a suit.  I don't even remember their names anymore.  They come marching into the studio and they give you that finger thing like, come here.  Come here.  The doctor's very angry.  Follow me so we can yell at you, even though you guys are adults.  He comes in and works on these pieces.  And you guys are putting different music behind it. 
[00:13:30]  He works on this, chooses the music and everything.  All right.  Enough.  Worry about it.  Put the Beatles music behind it.  Yeah.  Little George Harrison.  So there's that room.  So you're supposed to go in the room and you can take the beeper if you want to go get something to eat.  It covers the whole hospital.  Right.  So I'm wearing the beeper and I'm not going to sit in the room.  I don't want to hear people.  And then they have off the room are the little private rooms where it goes doctor, family, consultation rooms. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, boy.  So you just know troubles going on in there.  And then you look to the side and there's like the chapel and the priest is walking around like, oh, this is the bad area.  The bad area.  So I decided to go into onto the other end close, but the other end of the hallway.  There's a big glass room and this family's sitting in there and they don't seem so sad.  And there's TV in there.  So I go in and I watch and I'm sitting down and Lifetime is on. 
[00:14:30]  A Lifetime movie is on.  And there's women sitting in there.  So I'm like, I'm just going to sit.  I'm just going to watch this.  It was so embarrassing to sit there.  You think Lifetime is a safe thing, but it was a movie about a dentist played by Tom Wopat.  Tom Wopat was the dentist and apparently he was raping his patients.  And I'm sitting there with these old ladies and I have to watch this and I'm looking up and there's Tom Wopat. 
[00:15:00]  And a woman is under anesthesia and Tom Wopat's hands going up like our thigh and he's unbuttoning the shirt.  And I'm looking nervously over at the women.  He raped me.  It was so embarrassing, dude.  I was turning red.  I kept looking over my shoulder out the window like, is a doctor coming to consult with me?  Because I didn't want to look at the screen. 
[00:15:30]  Why would they watch Lifetime in a hospital?  There was one rape victim and she had no one to back up a story.  So Tom Wopat just said, look, it's consensual sex.  He got her pregnant.  So they did the DNA testing and Tom Wopat's baby.  It wasn't.  He said, well, no, we had an affair.  She's a married woman, but an affair.  She's like, hey, right.  All right.  How did he get caught?  They always get caught because that's the women's channel.  They guys are all scum on that channel.  Well, his lawyer was very good.  It was what's her name?  Wonder Woman. 
[00:16:00]  That Wonder Woman was his lawyer.  Linda Carter?  Yes, Linda Carter was his lawyer.  And then I believe, who's the Emmy Award winner or the Emmy nominated but never won actress?  Susan Lucci.  Susan Lucci, I believe, was the other lawyer.  And they figured with the rape victim, the original one, she found another woman that was raped.  So they go into court figuring this is a slam dunk.  But this private investigator for Linda Carter comes up. 
[00:16:30]  She was an actress, you know, and a budding, aspiring actress.  What did he find, the private investigator?  Nice little video and pictures of her early modeling days.  So threw her out.  Couldn't use her as a witness because she was doing porno.  Well, why can't you use someone as a witness just because they did porno back in the day?  Ah, dumb, Maddox.  Because Tom Wopat's lawyer, Linda Carter, was fantastic.  I hate that crap when you read about cases and stuff.  Oh, this person was thrown out because, you know, they went to a kegger once in college. 
[00:17:00]  Well, that's what they do.  I mean, it's like.  They do.  So they figured what they got to do is plant cameras.  They still saw her in the car accident.  I mean, give me a break.  Doesn't matter.  Not a credible witness.  They planted cameras in the office and got a female cop that was attractive and needed dental work.  What are the odds?  He gave her a good cleaning.  All of a sudden, oh, look, my face and hair are clean, too.  That's what he was doing.  But so they have the cameras on him.  Wait, so she had big boobies and.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like a and a and a food pocket that needed. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Cleaning out.  They they had a tender moment where she didn't want to do it.  So the rape victim had to sit her down and say, we can't have this happen to another woman.  And she's like, well, I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.  You need to be strong.  She goes, but what if he touches me and stuff?  We'll be there for you.  We'll the other rape victim.  And then she told the story.  She goes, I understand.  Because when I went into my first teaching class, I was scared, too.  It's like you're in a classroom with kids.  It's not some dentist who's zipping his fly down. 
[00:18:00]  Jesus.  That has the nerve switch going off.  The same level of importance on this whole thing.  Boy, didn't she have other cops watching?  No, no cop.  Yes, they did.  They had cameras and cops in the next room and everything.  And she still didn't know if she could do it.  She's in the wrong profession.  So they give her the anesthesia.  She's laying there.  She gets into the recovery room.  And then Tom Wolpat comes in and starts putting his hand down her shirt.  But he starts taking off the heart monitor stuff. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  But then he kisses her.  Why do you need heart monitor stuff?  I don't know.  It's dental work.  But it's Tom Wolpat.  I don't know.  So he starts kissing her.  But then a nurse walks in.  And they're like, damn it, we don't have enough.  Damn it.  So it ruined the whole thing.  But then they figured she had a little residual pain that night.  So they sent her back for an emergency visit at night when he's alone.  And there's no nurse in the office.  So he goes in.  Brilliant.  Puts a rundag, gets her in the recovery room.  And then he really starts going at it.  And this is where I was completely embarrassed. 
[00:19:00]  I'm sitting in the waiting room, a bunch of old ladies.  I'm watching this stupid Lifetime movie.  And Tom Wolpat goes to town.  Unbuttons her shirt, her sweater.  Opens it up.  There's her ample breasts and a pink little bra.  Just heaving.  Heaving.  Whoa.  And then he pulls her skirt up.  And then Tom Wolpat, you see, he takes his shirt off.  And Tom Wolpat's hairy chest from the chest up, you see.  And then you hear, zip.  Oh, yeah.  Then what happened?  And then the walkie-talkie from the cop.  All right, make the move. 
[00:19:30]  Go, go, go.  And the whole time, the rape victim is actually sitting next to the cop watching the video.  Like, she'd be allowed in.  And all she's doing is these uncomfortable squirms going, no, no.  Holding herself like, oh, no.  Watching the monitor.  Then what happened?  The cops burst in and go, freeze, police.  All right.  And they arrest Tom Wolpat for the dental rapist that he is.  And then they had sex with the cop because she was still out.  She was still out, so the two cops banged her.  That was great. 
[00:20:00]  And then she woke up and said, oh, it was ugly.  It was horrible.  Blamed it on Tom Wolpat.  Get yourself to a doctor.  Stupid Tom Wolpat.  And the title was like something.  And then it was subtitled, she woke up pregnant.  And, of course, they had the big controversy between her and the husband.  Oh, yeah.  Who was like now bitter because she's pregnant when some guy's a baby.  The dentist rapist.  And he's like, I don't know how to handle this.  I walk around.  I'm in the joke of the town. 
[00:20:30]  So how did that end?  I don't think they got back together.  Oh, no.  You know, there's some residual collateral damage in those movies.  It's so embarrassing.  The old ladies are watching.  And I'm looking.  And I'm looking at Tom Wolpat's hand going up her leg.  And I'm looking at her.  And I got my hand up her thigh because I'm just looking, watching the movie.  You should just unzip your fly.  Start just cranking.  I love this movie.  If someone's crying, you'll shut up.  I'm trying to keep my rod.  Keep it down. 
[00:21:00]  Pipe down.  Why would you watch Lifetime waiting for a loved one to have some horrific operation?  Because it's on.  Like, I had no choice.  Not you.  I know.  Why did I?  You didn't have a horrific operation.  Yours was, you know, your girl's operation was, you know, it's one of the ones that is kind of easy.  But I'm sure, you know, not everyone in this situation had an easy operation waiting for the outcome.  No.  There was people being wheeled by, I swear, with their heads, like big scars down their shaved heads.  Like, there's brain surgery going on right next door. 
[00:21:30]  And I'm watching Tom Wolpat.  Yeah.  And then after the Tom Wolpat movie's over, the woman goes, you could change this if you want.  Because straight, gay, or taken was coming on.  Where the woman's got to guess if the guy's straight, gay, or taken.  It's a game show kind of thing.  She goes, you could change this if you want.  Could I change Tom Wolpat?  So I put on Leave it to Beaver.  You should have watched straight, gay, or taken.  I think she didn't want it on.  She was offended by it.  And I'm sitting there watching Tom Wolpat diddle. 
[00:22:00]  Leave it to Beaver's better than straight, gay, or taken?  I love Leave it to Beaver.  Yeah.  It was the accordion episode.  It's great.  All right, who wants to do the beaver joke?  Just kidding.  That's it.  I watched Tom Wolpat just before.  Why am I watching it now?  All right.  Straight, gay, or taken, how would she tell us?  She would just smell the guy's breath?  Chlorine.  All right, we'll get part two of the story, because we don't even know when the surgery happened.  Of course.  It's supposed to be three o'clock in the afternoon.  You're going to tell us the time.  Yes.  Quick, maybe a quick bet for everybody out there.  A bet?  A bet? 
[00:22:30]  Oh.  All right, I'll put money down.  Oh, damn, I know the answer.  I'm a shoo-in.  All right, they're going to guess what time the operation was.  Yes.  Considering you got here as Ecstasy of Gold was playing, I imagine it was pretty late  in the day.  Wrote up like Clint.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got Bob Kelly here.  Of course, Jimmy's here.  I think Louis C.K.'s coming in.  It's one of those weird days.  But it will be a fine, fine show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:23:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  And we finally can get some energy behind this Whip'em Out Wednesday again because Tracy,  the new PD here in New York City, 92.3 KROQ, she finally got the brand new Wow stickers  printed.  And I guess we'll be all over New York City and Long Island and Jersey.  And we'll go up to that Westchester County that we don't know much about, and we'll start 
[00:23:30]  getting those new stickers out there.  Of course, she likes Wow.  She's got 36 double D's.  Is that who I think it is?  Yeah.  The Matt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did.  Wow.  Yeah, Bob Kelly has a little crush.  Do you?  He's a little crush.  What are we in?  Hey, you can still.  In your high?  He just said that.  You got a little crush.  He whispered that, dude.  You're actually on.  Oh, yeah.  There's a few people listening to this, including your girlfriend.  Hey, man.  You can still window shop. 
[00:24:00]  You're not buying anything, Bobby.  Yuck, do I hate that?  Hey, I can still window shop, you know.  When a girl goes, I don't care where he gets his appetite.  As long as he knows where to come for dinner.  See?  Exactly.  We'll fret, you meatloaf.  We'll think of steak.  What?  I just realized I couldn't say what I was going to make.  That would have made that a joke.  So I just said words. 
[00:24:30]  As long as he comes home to me.  All right.  We guess.  You're a new age girl.  My girlfriend doesn't care.  She's like, have sex with whoever you want.  Just, I don't want to know about it.  What?  That's what I tell myself.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's hope that's what she says.  She says, just wipe the glitter off before you come home, please.  Not the glitter.  The guy who invented the glitter and the scrunchie stinks.  Yeah.  They always leave a scrunchie at your house.  Right.  A scrunchie. 
[00:25:00]  This isn't mine.  Hey, by the way, I was thinking about these WOW stickers.  WOW, of course, is whipping out Wednesday.  People get very excited when they can throw one of these WOW stickers on their car.  Because there are women out there.  Maybe we should take a few calls from the women today.  To prove this is going on.  Women are driving around.  They see the WOW sticker.  They will flash you.  But I was driving around over the weekend.  I was all over Long Island.  There are old WNEW Opie and Anthony WOW stickers.  Yep.  There is XM Satellite Radio WOW stickers. 
[00:25:30]  There's Free FM WOW stickers.  When this station we're on right now did the talk thing for a while.  And now there's going to be 92.3 K-Rock Opie and Anthony WOW stickers.  Yeah.  We are confusing everybody out there on the road.  I know.  They're going to be all over with all different locations for us.  Some of which we are not at anymore.  I like when they write it with their finger in the dirt in the back of the truck.  That's the best.  Cool, right?  But I'm hoping that maybe you guys could update your stickers because it's very confusing out there.  Sticker updates.  Yeah.  If you got an old one, maybe you get a new one and throw it right over the old one. 
[00:26:00]  Help us out a little bit.  When we were driving up Saturday for the fun of the Renaissance Fair, we were stopped just before that by a big fireman.  We're doing this thing where they were stopping cars and asking for money.  You know how they do that sometimes.  Yeah.  So they have these buckets and all the guys had WOW stickers on them.  Very cool.  So I pull up, you know, I throw them some cash and I go, what's the, wow, what's that sticker?  Oh, Opie and Anthony's show.  And then they named the station here in New York, said 92.3 K-Rock. 
[00:26:30]  I was like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I go, you listen to them guys?  Yeah, yeah, every morning.  I was like, oh, okay.  Take it easy.  Maybe he didn't recognize you because you were dressed like D'Artagnan.  Perhaps that was a problem.  I didn't think of that.  Well, I stopped.  Anthony couldn't possibly be this big of an a-hole.  I stopped chasing guys on the LIE that have WOW stickers because they think I'm a creep.  I was like.  Or a chick wanting to WOW you.  No.  Wow them. 
[00:27:00]  I would be sure.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  I would drive on the LIE.  I would see a WOW sticker.  So I would speed up and, like, get all excited.  Like, hey, that's me.  Hey, that's me.  And they would just start driving faster.  Like, what's wrong with this creep?  I'm looking for chicks, you queer.  Because you're pointing down.  They think it's like you're pointing, like, into the lap.  Like, hey, I'll pull it in my mouth.  So if you have a WOW sticker, I'm out there.  And I appreciate it.  But I'm not going to be honking anymore or chasing you. 
[00:27:30]  I'll just let you live your life.  Like, just get a little excited.  Leave him alone.  Right.  Well, I asked.  You got the guy and he actually pulled him over.  And you're like, it's me.  He goes, I know, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  Whatever.  Embarrassing.  Oh, how funny would that be?  I'm late.  I'm late for work.  I'm late.  I get it.  Jesus, man.  It's not even my car, man.  I'm borrowing it from my brother.  All right.  What do you got there?  It's the second half of the hospital story.  I got to correct my mistake.  Certainly do.  It was not Tom Wopat.  I always got Tom Wopat confused with Joe Penny. 
[00:28:00]  Did you?  As you were trying to scrap at three in the morning alone?  When you were fantasizing about what man would take you?  Shut up.  That was Tom Wopat's hairy chest?  Well, it was Joe Penny's hairy chest.  And then he zipped, unzipped.  Who cared?  It was just embarrassing.  So you're watching the Lifetime movie.  Yeah, nothing else to do.  And then a commercial came on for a new Lifetime movie where none other than lovable Kevin Arnold,  Fred Savage, is on the screen. 
[00:28:30]  And they play nice music.  And then all of a sudden, he's with some chick.  And everything's going fine.  And it's a typical Lifetime thing.  Everything's going dandy until they really start hooking up and getting together and knowing  each other.  And then he's just beating the crap out of this chick.  And she's like, is this love?  Is this what you call love?  In a very special Lifetime movie.  White Snake, is this love? 
[00:29:00]  Let's go, Iraq.  It's Fred Savage.  No, we need that Lifetime crappy, like, sap music.  In a new Lifetime movie starring Fred Savage.  He's moved on from being Kevin Arnold.  And now he's a real douche.  And he's just beating this woman.  Why do you?  You said you love me.  And he's choking her against a wall.  It's like, that's how you get credibility if you were like Tom Arnold or Kevin Arnold. 
[00:29:30]  Tom Arnold.  If you were Kevin Arnold.  Yeah.  A little Fred Savage.  And you want to kind of get that behind you.  You do a Lifetime movie and play a rapist or someone that just beats women.  And then at the end you get burnt in a bed or shot or something.  There you go.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I was Kevin Arnold.  I used to beat Winnie Cooper like this.  Well, it was very embarrassing in the waiting room. 
[00:30:00]  But like I said, I was in the hospital there.  Because my girlfriend had her gallbladder taken out.  It was supposed to happen Monday.  Then it was supposed to happen yesterday at 3.  Yesterday at 3.  So they go, oh, we're going to take her down in there a little early.  I go, good.  They give me the beeper.  You could go anywhere with the beeper.  So I'm just sitting there.  And now you're waiting for the beeper to go off.  You know?  You don't want any problems.  You don't want any complications or anything like that.  So about an hour and a half went by. 
[00:30:30]  And my beeper goes off.  I'm like, oh, that's quick.  That's a little quicker than they said.  So I rush down there.  And the woman goes, oh, no.  No, I just wanted to tell you that they just started.  Like, what?  Why the?  Oh, Jesus.  How long of a procedure?  It takes about two hours.  So it's like they just started.  So now it's 3.15.  And they had just started.  We just started the operation. 
[00:31:00]  It was supposed to be at 2.30 and then 3, but now it's 3.15.  What?  It's 3.  What?  So she reboots my beeper and says, they just didn't want you to worry, but they started  now.  When they rebooted your beeper, did they say smoking or non-smoking?  Yeah.  What do you want?  Do you want a booth? 
[00:31:30]  Try the dessert.  Have a cheesecake.  Where are you going to be?  Are you going to be at the bar?  Are you going to be waiting outside?  Bar.  I wish there was a bar.  I had to go back to a stupid lifetime.  Yeah.  But no, they give you a beeper and you got to wait for it and then the beeper goes off  again a little later and I'm like, okay, it's done.  No, it's just time to turn in the beepers.  Now you got to wait in that area.  You can't mosey around anymore for the doctor.  So I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.  Did you go in the chapel like Rocky and just pray for her? 
[00:32:00]  Hey, you know, hey, Mickey.  Did you go in the room and read to her?  Someday you will come back.  And she gave birth to a wonderful gallbladder.  I want to thank you.  But Mickey's not here.  Give me!  Hey!  Maybe me and you and the gallbladder go to the zoo.  I like the tigers.  Sheck is.  And yeah, I went back there and had to wait for the doctor now to come in. 
[00:32:30]  And this whole time, it's just ping, ping, ping, ping, text, text, text, text, everybody.  What's happening?  How's she doing?  This, that.  I had to take phone calls from relatives.  I, you know.  Why don't you like taking phone calls from relatives?  I barely talk to my own family.  I understand that.  I love my family.  Don't get me wrong. 
[00:33:00]  I love my mommy.  I love Dorney.  I love Sal.  Christmas shoes.  Joe.  My media family.  Right.  You know, I don't, I don't, I'm not used to dealing with girlfriends' families.  I usually come from girlfriends that, I don't know, their family was wiped out in some cataclysm.  Or the father left and that.  So, you know.  But I got to deal with family members.  I do that.  As part of the thing.  I deal with Jen and Buddy, her sister and brother-in-law out in Colorado. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  And then she was nice enough to make the family calls after I got the info.  But they come out and one, one, one doctor comes out and this woman comes out and now  they're talking right in front of me because I can't leave that area.  Right.  And you know me with hospital stuff.  I don't like watching ER because it's too gruesome.  You don't like getting just stuff on your hands in the morning.  No.  You get creeped out by all this stuff, germs and things.  Um, things went well. 
[00:34:00]  Things went well.  You're hearing them talking to an attorney.  Another family?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Things went well.  We removed a liter and a half of liquid from his chest cavity.  Um, what we had to do to make the cavity smaller because the liquid keeps forming in there.  We put a drain in and we had to rough up the rib cage.  I used like a, and he's saying this, I used a, um, a file and we roughed up the rib cage.  So now, uh, when it heals, the lungs will adhere to the rib cage to, uh, diminish the size of that pocket that the liquid was. 
[00:34:30]  He used a cheese grater on the inside of his ribs.  You know what it sounds like?  Uh, if you ever take a peek at those, uh, cooking shows, they're like, all right, so how'd you make the cake?  This is what the, I had to listen to this.  This is what the surgeon sounds like.  I'm getting all woozy because it's, it's just, oh, I'm picturing someone taking a cheese grater to the inside of your rib cage and it's horrifying me. 
[00:35:00]  And it's, it's like, he goes, it works like a Velcro.  The lungs will stick to the rib cage now and eliminate the pie.  She goes, but there's, he's there, he goes, there's going to be a drain in there.  Yeah.  And you're going to have to have a home nurse that comes in every two days is going to have to pump that liquid out and pump the liquid, pump the liquid because, but we didn't find any, um, tumors or anything.  And they talk in tumors and I'm just like freaking out.  And then they, uh, what I think when you hear that type of thing, there goes that guy's sex life. 
[00:35:30]  It's over.  Who the hell wants to bang him when, when the person knows that a nurse has to come and drain his chest?  Drain that chest liquid.  Banana juice could actually go all over your chest while you're having sex with him.  Yeah.  Nothing, nothing takes the sexiness away from sex.  When you realize that the person you're supposed to have sex with had, had their ribs, uh, cheese grated.  So the lung sticks to it.  And it can leak out on you during sex.  Oh, look at that.  I'll just tape out a goodie. 
[00:36:00]  What happened?  You typed goodie?  Goodie.  What?  It's my baby.  Oh.  My girl.  So then, you know what took so long?  Why there was a delay?  Huh?  You know why there was a delay?  Why?  Because during all this whole thing, she's been given blood, taken, they take blood, they take urine, they take, uh, uh, uh, tests of everything.  Uh, uh, you know, checking for, uh, everything.  They wheel her in for the operation and look at the chart and go, oh, we never gave her a pregnancy test. 
[00:36:30]  And she goes, don't worry about that, I'm not pregnant.  And, uh, no, she wasn't.  But they, they had to give her a pregnancy test before she went in and, and got the, uh, operation done.  So it's sitting another hour waiting.  Oh, we'll get that pregnancy test right away because this is top priority and we better make sure you get out of here quickly and back to the recovery room.  Because this is a hospital and people have to be taken care of. 
[00:37:00]  Holy mother of God.  Hey, I think we got a good combo here.  You talk really slow and then my sick laugh.  It's probably, it's probably creeping people out, out, out there.  It is creepy.  Damn, I gotta smoke some more pot to listen to this.  Very meticulous.  So she's in there.  Pregnancy test takes seconds, though.  It's a little.  Not in a hospital.  Just gotta see a strip turn blue or whatever it is.  Blue, paint.  No, they don't. 
[00:37:30]  What do you think?  They use that store-bought crap?  Why not?  They take a blood sample and use that.  They give it a kick to the abdomen and see if anything pops out.  Just stand over this white tarp.  There it is.  We have one stewed tomato.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Sorry.  That's the test.  Kick, and then the doctor cups his ear and listens for the kerplunk. 
[00:38:00]  So they did that, and more time goes by, and then a doctor comes by.  A woman doctor comes by, and she looks in the room, because I didn't want to be in the  room with the families and stuff like that.  So I'm standing outside the door, kind of leaning against the wall, screwing around with  the iPhone, you know.  I got a signal, so I was able to go on the web and just scroll around.  And she goes, oh, Mr.  Kumia?  I was like, yes.  And she goes, okay.  Everything went fine.  We took the gallbladder out. 
[00:38:30]  We were able to do laparoscopic surgery, which is good.  You know, they don't take the machete and slice open her abdomen.  They poke a few tiny holes.  They do something.  Three or four holes, right?  It's not even a hole.  It's a little incision with these little micro stitches, and you don't even see scars.  And then the belly button.  They go inside the belly button and cut that, and then stick something in there.  They put a camera in the other hole there, and they kind of, like, peek around. 
[00:39:00]  And then they pull the gallbladder out of the belly button like an alien.  Nice.  Like that Mexican witch doctor?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're pressing and pull a cotton ball with blood on it.  You are cured.  How do they untie the belly button?  You don't untie it.  It's just there.  Look at your belly button.  It's tied.  God, she's got an alien.  It'd be impossible, an Audi.  Just squeeze it like a zit.  But, yeah, they took it right out of there.  Maybe she has an Audi now because that's the gallbladder. 
[00:39:30]  No, I saw it.  I was actually going to look.  Yeah, the gallbladder's hanging out.  Hi, baby.  Wait, what'd you see?  I was able to look.  At what?  At the incisions and the thing because they were just covered up with, like, this clear  little Band-Aid.  I thought you were able to watch the surgery.  No, they were just, like, three little Band-Aids.  Like nothing.  Can I, there's an observation coming in.  Oh, of course.  We like when the audience participates.  There's an observation coming in.  And this guy didn't leave his name, unfortunately.  But he's noticing that you're a different person. 
[00:40:00]  He goes, Ant, you're a fag.  If Jennifer, which is Ant's ex-wife, sorry to bring that up, Ant, was in surgery, you would  have been in a hot tub with a chick with braces.  All right.  I don't know if I can deny that.  I really don't know.  There's a lot more concern these days.  The old days, you would have been like, ah, call me when you need a ride home, sweetie.  Yeah.  You should have been the obnoxious boyfriend screaming that you better not have scarring  or you're not going to be able to F.  Better not be any scarring. 
[00:40:30]  Take care of that.  And hey, Doc, how about an extra stitch?  Oh, wait a minute.  That's for the pregnancy.  See?  So what time was the surgery?  People bet out there.  Finally got to it at 3.30.  Oh, that's not bad.  That's when it was.  But she was supposed to be in early.  Right.  Like they were like, hey, we could take you early.  So they wheeled her down there at about 2.15.  So I'm like, all right, great.  Going to get this done with early.  And didn't start until an hour later or so or an hour and 15 minutes. 
[00:41:00]  But then they go, okay, you could see her in recovery.  And recovery is always fun because the person is so effed up.  They give them, you know, the drugs.  And she's like, how are you doing?  Everything went fine.  I woke up.  I didn't know who anybody was.  I was like, that's because they're doctors and you don't know them.  It's not the drugs.  You just don't know them.  We don't hang out with doctors.  We've never seen these people before in our lives. 
[00:41:30]  I was scared because I didn't know who anybody was.  And then all of a sudden they'll be like, well, they took the.  Like, baby, are you sleeping?  Oh, baby.  Hi.  Yeah, I was just here.  You all of a sudden got Alzheimer's for a second.  Hold my hand.  Oh, that's a nice icy hand.  Yuck.  I can't really talk.  My throat is so drunk. 
[00:42:00]  Ask if I could have some water because I'm.  And then the nurse comes over.  Oh, we'll get her some water right away.  Any second now, there'll be plenty of water for you.  Your friend.  She's thirsty.  Hi, baby.  Ah, number three. 
[00:42:30]  You're up a third time.  Oh, the guy.  And the nurse comes over.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Just going to give her a little something for the pain.  Yeah.  Because I thought that's what she had.  Yeah.  We just can't give her a little more because.  She's a very tender tummy and stuff.  And they inject it with something.  She's just.  That was the same stuff.  They go.  She's gone.  We're going to wheel her up to the room in about an hour so you can see her then.  So I go up to the room and I'm just lounging around up there watching TV and finally they brought her up about an hour later and she's fine. 
[00:43:00]  Fine and dandy.  As a matter of fact, her last text that just came in moments ago.  They are still planning to send me home today.  So they're sending her home this morning.  And my answer was goody.  Goody.  I answered goody.  I didn't have time for goody, goody gumdrops.  Well, you will because we're going to take a break.  Oh, good.  I'll find out what time.  I'm in your face right now looking at you.  But Anthony hasn't slept in like three days. 
[00:43:30]  The sleep is bad.  And I've slept on like chairs.  But you can't sleep in a chair.  There was one thing.  She had to go for one of the tests Saturday or Sunday where they do.  They make a drink, some radioactive stuff, and then they put some scanner over for two hours.  And I'm sitting in this chair.  And the room is freezing cold to keep the equipment cool.  So I'm covered with hospital blankets in a chair.  And it's a regular chair, a hard surface chair. 
[00:44:00]  And I'm turning, trying to get comfortable in this thing, leaning my head on the back of a chair.  And you know how like your normal office chair is kind of soft on the top.  So you can actually lean your head there and maybe catch some cushioning.  This was a slice of wood about a quarter inch thick that was carving into the side of my skull.  Were you sick of saying, I'm not the patient?  I'm not the patient.  I just look horrible.  Stop trying to wheel me away.  I'm not the patient. 
[00:44:30]  Stop it.  Hey, Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Did Ann take the gallbladder home as a tasty treat for Jack Jack?  A little Jack Jack.  No, it was full of marbles.  And Hector from Georgia.  The reason the surgery took so long was her parents needed to sign her permission.  Look, consent form.  Wait, my thing is if the gallbladder stones are hard, how do they have to squeeze it out  through that little laparoscopic surgery?  Well, I'm sure it stretches open a little bit.  And then they can hack it up if need be and kind of take it out in pieces. 
[00:45:00]  It's not like I'm going to save it like a little sack.  Well, the stones aren't that big in the gallbladder.  No, no, they're not that big.  Your kidney stones get pretty big.  They're not that big.  But it was like full of the little gallstones.  And if they clog up one of the little ducts to one of the tubes that are in there, that's  what the problem is.  Make one of those Indian medicine bags.  Yes, medicine bag.  I love it.  You blow it up and harden it and make it a maraca.  Could you keep it if you wanted to? 
[00:45:30]  No, they don't let you keep biohazardous waste anymore in the hospitals.  Go figure.  And the ducts just don't smoke in the hallways anymore, Bobby.  What year is this?  All right.  We got to take a break.  All righty.  Lots to do.  We got Rob Zombie coming in today to talk about what?  Halloween.  Halloween.  Very cool.  And they're releasing it early.  They're releasing it in a couple weeks, right?  Good.  Yeah, it's an odd time.  Usually these Halloween movies are around Halloween.  But in this case, I think they are going early with it.  Good.  Maybe early September.  I'm not sure.  And also we got Maury coming in at 7. 
[00:46:00]  I want to talk to Maury.  Maury Povich coming in at 7.30.  He has a lot of fun when he comes in because he doesn't deny anything.  We like Maury and his latest, that whole fear thing where he takes people and just scares  the bejesus out of them with whatever their phobia is and laughs.  Can we play Cotton Man?  And it's covered under the guise that he's actually helping.  Can we play Cotton Ball Man next?  Please.  All right.  We'll do Cotton Ball next.  Just a little taste of that to get everyone ready for Maury today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Rock and roll. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, good morning.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Maury Povich will be here in a few minutes.  Nice.  Can't get enough of his phobia shows.  Hey, want to play Cotton Ball Man again?  Cotton Ball Man for the woman that was afraid of cotton.  Well, let's do the quick clip from Carolyn here.  Or is it Caroline?  Carolyn, Caroline, Brian.  Whatever.  No.  We should make a new rule.  It's the same freaking pronunciation for both of those so we don't have to be confused 
[00:47:00]  every time we have to say your name.  Carolyn is afraid of Cotton Balls.  This is her nightmare.  I have a nightmare of a man who is made of Cotton Balls and he is trying to kill me by  putting them in my mouth.  And I've had this recurring dream for as long as I can remember. 
[00:47:30]  I have a one-year-old and he has toys that I can't even play with him with.  Or when I go to change his diaper, I'm scared that the cotton is going to come out of it.  The brown cotton.  I don't want to deal with this anymore.  She'll put you in a microwave.  We keep playing this clip.  We keep playing this clip.  The bird clip is just as good.  So Maury decides he's got to cure her fear and he brings out a guy that is completely covered 
[00:48:00]  in cotton balls.  And he looks very...  You would think that would look funny, but it's like surgical cotton he was covered in.  So he looks like the mummy.  Yeah.  And very scary looking.  Like if this thing was walking around on the street at night, you would run in fear.  It's a very scary cotton monster.  He would make a great killer in a movie.  Cotton man.  Cotton ball man or whatever.  So...  And that's Maury's idea, though, of curing her of this whole thing is to just bring the 
[00:48:30]  one thing she is most afraid of and then laughing at her.  Remember the last thing you're supposed to do to a person like this?  Oh, of course it is.  He just makes it the first thing.  Baby steps.  One single cotton ball 20 feet away from her is the way to start.  She's not Batman.  You must face your fears.  Put it in the cave in the well with the bats.  If you're scared of cotton ball, man, that's like years of therapy to get all the layers  out.  You got to dig deep.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  It's not going to be cured in 10 minutes on a...  10 minutes?  On a talk show.  Yeah.  Like five minutes with an audience full of cretins laughing at you.  Including the host.  Yeah.  Like how ridiculous it is.  She's scared of cotton ball.  You're an idiot.  You're stupid.  David, why are you living?  He's just cracking up at him.  It's insane.  That's why we love him.  All of a sudden, cotton ball man comes walking out from the side. 
[00:49:30]  She runs the other way.  And oh, Maury's got that figured out.  There's another cotton ball man on the other side.  Running out after her.  Right.  Cotton ball man was running after her.  All right, we got to play the clip one more time.  So this is what happened.  This Maury is a sick bastard.  I got pictures of cotton.  You're upset at those?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell me about this.  They're making that noise.  What noise?  They're just making the noise.  Cotton doesn't make a noise.  It does.  I got to find something.  Oh, God. 
[00:50:00]  Wait, wait a second.  Carolyn, don't go back there.  You're going to see more cotton than you want to see.  Don't go back there.  There's a lot of cotton back there.  Carolyn, come here.  Oh, my God.  This is one.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Get back.  I'm going to hit you.  I'm going to hit you.  Get back. 
[00:50:30]  No, I'm going to hit you.  No, I'm going to hit you.  Get back.  You're more than 11.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I can't believe it.  It just can't be good.  It can't be good.  I'm helping.  Move back, guys.  Move back.  Move back.  Okay.  We got it.  We got it.  All right.  All right.  Go on.  We got it.  Okay, we got it.  They all left.  We got the shot.  We got the shot.  I mean, we got the help.  We helped her.  Here come the ratings, baby. 
[00:51:00]  And Cottonball Man moves like a monster.  Like a monster.  His hands are out in front of him.  Arr.  Arr.  So there you go.  Scared the hell out of Winona Judd.  Yeah.  We're getting ready for our visit with Maury Povich in about 20 minutes.  We can't wait.  We got Lifetime movies in front of us.  These are just the movies that start with the letter A?  Yeah, because Lifetime is known for their uh-something movies. 
[00:51:30]  It's always uh-whatever.  Very dramatic.  Well, how about this?  A Child's Cry for Help.  Where's our Lifetime movie?  Music.  Lifetime.  A Child's Cry for Help on a Very Special Lifetime.  A Dad for Christmas.  That must have been a good one.  Yeah.  A Daughter's Conviction.  Uh-oh.  A Face to Kill for. 
[00:52:00]  A Father's Choice.  A Friend's Betrayal.  A Job to Kill for.  They're the same titles.  Uncreative asses over there.  A Killer Upstairs.  A Little Thing Called Murder.  A Lover's Revenge.  A Nightmare Come True.  A Piece of My Heart. 
[00:52:30]  A Touch of Hope.  A Vow to Kill.  A Woman Hunted.  Abduction.  Abducted.  All She Wants for Christmas.  Alone with a Stranger.  Ambulance Girl.  Wow.  An Unfinished Affair.  Any Mother's Son.  As Time Runs Out.  Awake.  To Danger. 
[00:53:00]  A Child's Wish.  A Crime of Passion.  A Deadly Vision.  A Face to Die For.  A Family Lost.  A Father for Brittany.  A Friendship to Die For.  They love that to die for thing.  I gotta slow you down.  A Father for Brittany.  Now that one sounds hot.  Yeah.  I like that one.  You're My New Daddy.  A Killer Within.  A Kiss So Deadly.  A Life Interrupted.  A Long Way Home.  A Perfect Murder.  A Town Without Christmas.  The Town You Live In, Anthony. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  A Town With A Lot Of Menorahs.  I like A Town Without Christmas.  Abduction.  A Father's Love.  Hmm.  Above Suspicion.  American Tragedy.  An Unexpected Love.  And Never Let Her Go.  Another Woman's Husband.  At The Mercy of A Stranger.  The Worst is the Last One. 
[00:54:00]  Aurora Borealis.  Isn't that the thing with the lights?  Yeah.  It's a light thing.  It's not a movie.  I don't know.  You missed your head involves some guy who looked like cool and like a good boyfriend.  She went and told her girlfriends that he was a great guy.  And then halfway through, he like punched her face.  And all she could see when she opened her eyes was stars and the Aurora Borealis.  Hey, you missed one, by the way.  Oh, which one?  Your Baby Is Black. 
[00:54:30]  I didn't think that was a Lifetime movie, was it?  Can we play the trailer?  We haven't played this in a while.  That sounds like it could be a Lifetime movie.  Yeah.  Your Baby Is Black.  Is Black.  Nothing you have ever seen before.  A real trailer.  And nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you for the shock of...  My Baby Is Black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never 
[00:55:00]  before told on the screen.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My Baby Is Black.  All right.  Hey.  You know, I don't want to blow it, but I know Lifetime was interested in doing some movies  about our staff.  Really?  They certainly were.  And you got a few of those?  What was that?  No, I just, I heard one.  I heard one.  Oh, okay.  Well, it could start something.  I mean, the instant feedback, they're looking for something to do today. 
[00:55:30]  I don't know who this is for, but they're doing one.  They said, a car battery for Fat Boy.  Well, the Steve C. story's coming in from Steve and S. from Bayshore.  A bear in chaps.  A C for Steve C.  A boyfriend, a Nazi.  A car crash. 
[00:56:00]  There goes Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's at the wall.  She's gone.  The Mac man delivered.  No.  What are they saying?  I was only joking.  Halfway.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'm telling you something.  How does that not go in?  Wake up.  That wasn't even close.  That was a whiff.  Three strikes.  I didn't even connect.  Ah, you're tired, though. 
[00:56:30]  I don't know.  I thought, ah.  And maybe if someone else would have said it.  Yeah, I think that was a problem.  Yeah, but you said it about yourself.  Yeah.  And then you clicked your heels together.  Maybe I was talking about somebody else.  No, you got to start with, ah.  I got to help out the instant feedback.  You got to start with, ah.  Although, Kevin, okay, from Marblehead Mass.  My baby is Canadian.  The Rich Voss story.  Oh, here's one.  A salad forgotten. 
[00:57:00]  You got to guess who they're for.  Puffy from Wagbag.  A fish stick for Sam.  A special boy wants nothing more than a fish stick.  Jason from Rye.  A bottle of Jack for Danny.  A neck pouch full of fish.  Hey, Phil Rizzuto died, man.  Ah, the scooter.  A coffin for scooter. 
[00:57:30]  For scooter.  He was 90, man.  He was born in 1917.  90?  Where's the tragedy?  He was an amazing shortstop.  No one remembers that because none of us were alive.  I don't even think our grandfathers were alive for Phil Rizzuto's shortstop days.  Good defensive shortstop.  He was an amazing shortstop.  Was he a great hitter, though?  He was an aggressive shortstop.  One of the first in the game.  With those big glasses?  Geez.  He'll be forgotten, though, because a jeter will always be remembered.  Yeah, yeah.  The first that they ever had.  Well, I think the rest of America knows who Phil Rizzuto is by now. 
[00:58:00]  Stop, of course.  Hey, George.  Steinbrenner had something to say.  Oh, see?  We're on the same page.  Steinbrenner.  I love when they do this, when someone near and dear to our hearts dies.  Yeah.  George Steinbrenner said, I guess heaven must have needed a shortstop.  Heaven must have needed a shortstop.  Then why would they take cheater?  He's young.  Exactly.  Why would Scooter's 90?  Yeah, I don't think heaven needs a 90-year-old shortstop.  I guess heaven needed a guy to leave in the sixth inning while the game is still being played. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, why would they take him?  I guess God doesn't believe in winning.  There's no winning in heaven, obviously.  God always picked a fat kid in school.  Right.  I guess Phil Rizzuto is playing with a fat kid at first.  This is a way to go to a deal.  This is one way to do this.  Like a nice young Thurman Munson is at the plate.  Right.  You know, catching.  And he's all excited because, you know, he finally gets the word that he's finally going  to get a shortstop for his heaven team.  Right. 
[00:59:00]  And it's 90-year-old Phil Rizzuto.  What am I doing?  What the F?  Can I trade?  Billy Martin's in the heaven dugout going, ah, this is BS!  How did I get this guy?  God, the Red Sox are going to kill us up here in heaven!  Ted Williams' head's at the plate.  Right, right.  We're playing Ted Williams' head today and they're giving me a 90-year-old shortstop there,  Mikey!  I guess heaven must have needed an announcer for the money store.  Heaven must have needed it.  Why don't you shut up, George?  That is just so hacky. 
[00:59:30]  We all know you just die and you rot.  They can't get anybody out on the field because they're all smelling jolting Joe's fingers.  I guess when Joe died, he said, I guess Marilyn must have needed a black eye.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Heaven needed a shortstop.  They certainly didn't.  When Munson died, did heaven need a pilot?  Shut your face.  Where's Pepitone when heaven needs a bag of... 
[01:00:00]  Corey Lytle's on the mound.  Right, right.  He said, Pepitone.  Joe Pepitone.  Oh, that is really awful.  Bill from Waterford.  Wow, I guess heaven needed someone to incessantly say holy cow for no reason.  Holy cow, I'm dead.  We have that money store.  A toothbrush for Eric.  Still coming in.  Poor Eric.  They went by too fast. 
[01:00:30]  Can't get it.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Yeah, so I guess heaven needed a shortstop.  That's what George Steinbrenner said today.  Oh, so if God said, we need a shortstop, let's go take this scooter.  Yeah.  He's doddering in a circle anyway.  That would be perfect for the team.  It's like very romantic, isn't it?  Picked for God's team.  Yeah.  Snap.  Exactly.  We thought we had God's cat when I was a kid.  We thought my cat was God's cat.  Oh, is that what you thought?  God's got like a thousand billion cats.  No, my cat was just a thing that lined up in a box in the yard. 
[01:01:00]  It's dead.  Well, better than my smoke.  He ended up full of maggots on the side of the road, flattened like a pancake for me  to come across because I smelled dead animals somewhere.  At least you got to bury your cat.  Well, yeah.  It was a sad day when you realized that that daddy wasn't taking the family pet to live  in some farm.  No.  In the middle of upstate.  He's dead.  And then you realized that that daddy was too cheap to give the family pet a proper  goodbye.  A proper burial.  And he was in the woods somewhere with his frozen eyes. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  I found my dog dead on the railroad tracks because my stepfather got mad at my mother  and kicked him out.  Was he cut in half?  No, he was just hit.  Yeah, he was just hit.  Got thrown to the side.  How did he not see the train coming?  That dumb dog.  Stupid dog.  What did he think it was?  A dumb dog you had.  He probably thought it was Bob riding a bike with a light on it to come get him.  Train just smashed him.  All right.  All right.  Look.  We kept it fun, but, you know, it always has to go there.  Oh, no.  Jason from Rye, because, you know, heaven needed a shortstop. 
[01:02:00]  Well, Jason from Rye writes, Lou Gehrig is at the plate wheeling his little ALS legs  around the bases.  All right.  Look, man.  Oh, my God.  Hey, but if you're following the logic of that George Steinbrenner, that would be a  mess of a team.  God's coaching baseball up in heaven.  Yeah.  All right.  He gets the old bloated Babe Ruth.  Great.  With the voice box. 
[01:02:30]  Wouldn't he just be taking everybody in their prime?  Mm-hmm.  Just in their prime.  That's it.  Yeah.  God, did he do the shortstop?  No, he didn't.  A shortstop for heaven.  God doesn't play sports.  What?  Silly.  Hey, speaking of Phil Rizzuto, he was a terrific announcer for the Yankees.  For the money store.  And he did those dumb commercials, yeah.  Here's some of his memorable quotes, or calls, I should say.  Ow, my prostate hurts. 
[01:03:00]  With the score tied 4-4 in the ninth inning of a game, Rizzuto offered this about squirrels.  In the backyard, we got a lot of trees.  In our home, I've watched them leap from limb to limb.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Oh, God.  Is that jackass, stupid F doing an Imus impression?  Can we please get that?  Oh, God.  It looks like someone's jealous again.  Oh, what's the matter?  Curtis and Kobe.  Perhaps your job's in jeopardy?  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  You're going to be fired. 
[01:03:30]  Curtis and Kobe were against him?  Yes.  They're against everybody.  They're against, because he's too cool for the room, man.  He thinks it's racist, because he's so full of guilt, and he tries to come off like he's  some kind of, uh...  Who are we?  Curtis.  Curtis.  He tries to come off like he's Mr. Love Everybody and hates anybody that's controversial.  Can we get the Curtis clip?  Let me hear his Imus impression.  I'm sure it rules.  And I want what he said about us after our last controversy. 
[01:04:00]  He's a douche.  He basically wants to beat us up.  Do ya?  Take another cab ride early in the morning with a pal.  Gonna drag you in the back seat.  What we just saw, because Imus, everyone knows by now, it's a big headline.  He settled with CBS, the station, the company we work for, for $20 million.  And immediately after, by the way...  Yes.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  The Rutgers Center is suing him.  As soon as the dollar figure came in, the poor victim couldn't wait to sue. 
[01:04:30]  And now where does she file?  In the Bronx.  The same ones that convicted Bernie Getz.  Oh, well, of course.  Shooting those innocent men.  I wonder why.  Like, you get a fair trial there.  I wonder why.  She ain't gonna get a dime.  Change of venue.  She shouldn't.  She's not gonna get a dime.  She doesn't have a case whatsoever.  She just doesn't have a case.  Doesn't matter.  Unless they don't want to fight this and they settle for some dumb...  Doesn't matter.  She's got a case or not.  She has no case.  You try this in the Bronx, it's done.  It's done.  Dude, you're...  She was a public figure. 
[01:05:00]  She has no case.  Dude, it's a race...  It's a racial battle.  This has nothing to do with justice, no case, the truth.  This is a race battle.  It's a battle between black and white.  They are gearing up to have black support and Imus is just gonna go in there, you know, with  a lawyer and try to duke it out, but he'll have to fork over money.  He shouldn't.  He should give her nothing. 
[01:05:30]  Nothing.  She said that she's bringing the case because she's been disparaged and it's ruined her  credibility and said, no, no one knows who you are.  If you walked in front of me, I wouldn't know who you were.  Most people still have no clue.  I wouldn't recognize her.  I have no clue.  No one cares.  Who's the six foot five broad?  That's what you're saying.  Hey, by the way, so Curtis and Kubi, what we just saw, stupid Curtis, who's an ass.  He is an absolute ass.  Do I just stop myself because we're on regular radio?  Yes.  Look at me with responsibility, Bob.  Stupid Curtis has to wear the Imus cowboy hat today and he's mocking him. 
[01:06:00]  And he put the Imus headphones on and he was doing an Imus.  Just another jealous radio show host that never went anywhere in his radio career.  Curtis is a cornwall.  This is the angel guy, right?  He's been a wannabe his whole life.  He was a wannabe cop.  He's been sitting in mornings for a long time, just kind of rotting.  No real buzz about him.  But as soon as someone gets in trouble like Ant and I with our latest thing, he's all  over TV saying he's going to beat us up if he ever sees us.  Boy, I'm scared of you.  He needs to upgrade that satin jacket. 
[01:06:30]  And the beret.  Yeah, satin jacket.  Satin isn't tough anymore.  This dumb beret that, you know, you show when Dinkins was in office and crime was running  rampant, perhaps it was refreshing to have and you felt safe having a guardian angel on  one of the subways.  But now it's, you know, it's a little passe.  Say Giuliani kind of put a stop to that whole thing and made you insignificant.  When you see those guys now in New York, you kind of push them out of the way.  Like, could you get out of my way?  I'm trying to get on the subway. 
[01:07:00]  Excuse me.  There's a soldier with an M16 right next to you.  Your cute little satin jacket.  You know, what is that going to stop at this point?  Members only jackets and berets.  And there's a bunch of guys that are just out of shape.  It's like, I get it.  This isn't 1979 anymore.  Can you move out of my way?  I'm late for a meeting.  They all have bunts.  Yeah.  Just little fat stomachs, little flat asses.  Hey, Curtis, go bitch out the mob again.  Go bitch out the mob and see where that gets you.  With a few more holes in your belly.  He's a boring radio guy.  Dope. 
[01:07:30]  He's a boring radio guy.  He says things like he rhymes with the mobsters with the, we get it.  You're an old neighborhood Joe.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm a just, hey, I'm just a neighborhood tough guy.  You know, neighborhood tough guy on the air.  Local boy.  I make good.  Local boy makes good.  Shut up.  They're always looking for promos for our show.  Opie and Anthony, they love the mob.  There you go.  Mob never did me wrong.  Mob always took care of me.  My grandfather did a great job.  I hear tell he was a numbers runner. 
[01:08:00]  Eh, low level stuff.  But it was fun.  And then I have another guy.  I think it was, who the hell was his name?  Uncle Jakey, maybe?  And he used to come by with furs all the time.  And these trucks.  And he used to come by with a bunch of stuff and go, could I keep this stuff in the garage  for a while?  And I'll be back to pick it up.  And he'd like put all kinds of stuff in there.  He goes, take what you want.  Dude, back in the day I caddied for a lot of mob guys.  They treated me like a superstar, man. 
[01:08:30]  I would caddy for a mob guy over anybody else.  They know how to pull out some green for you.  Gotti's neighborhood.  Safe neighborhood.  That whole neighborhood was safe.  He used to have the big fireworks show.  Big barbecues for the neighborhood.  Ah, the good old days.  So, Curtis is mocking Imus today.  Just showing his jealousy once again.  He rhymes.  What a douche.  He is a douche.  All right, we got to take a break.  We'll get back into the Phil Rizzuto thing because people are commenting on other things  that heaven obviously needed. 
[01:09:00]  The Benoit jokes are coming in like crazy.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Chris Benoit jokes are coming in because, you know, heaven needed a shortstop.  Well, heaven needed some other things.  And they're having fun with that on the Instant Feedback.  We'll read some of those in a bit.  But next, Maury Povich.  Oh, thank God.  Maury Povich will be on that couch.  Nice.  We can't wait.  It's been a while.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  We got a full house today.  And one of our favorite guests is in studio. 
[01:09:30]  Maury Povich.  Maury.  Oh, my Lord.  How are you, sir?  I don't know how this relationship started with you because we're like, Maury's not going  to dig our show.  Oh, yeah, I do.  And then you came in that first time and we laughed so hard and we realized that.  I don't get this.  Opie, you keep getting younger.  Thank you, sir.  And Anthony, you and me.  I'm getting more gray by the moment.  See, he's got that hair color that the grays don't really show up in.  Well, and I didn't stay up all night.  His girlfriend had minor surgery. 
[01:10:00]  My girlfriend had gallbladder surgery.  So he's a mess.  So I've been up for days.  She doesn't need the gallbladder.  No.  Nobody needs gallbladder.  Nah, you get that right out.  She was afraid of the gallbladder.  She was fearful.  I wanted to book her on your show.  Yeah.  And you could have shaken her of that fear of the gallbladder.  I'm not surprised there aren't more, you know, ambulance chasing gallbladder surgeons.  I got to tell you a little something about his girlfriend.  She's the first one to have her gallbladder removed before her tonsils.  She still has her tonsils. 
[01:10:30]  That must be nice.  I went a little younger than my own age, Maury.  See, that was a young girl.  I know.  All right.  All right, Maury.  We all got our removed at five.  Yeah.  I'm very relieved that Maury came in here with his gray hair because we've been making funny.  I'm like, dude, your hair is way too dark for your age on TV.  But you don't understand.  See, my audience, like your audience, is the youngest viewing audience in all of television.  So what am I supposed to be?  The mountain man?  You don't need grandpa out there. 
[01:11:00]  Exactly.  Maury looks good.  So in the summer, when I vacation, and we have a home in, believe it or not, Montana.  Montana.  For 10 years, we go away to Montana from June to August.  And I come back looking like a mountain man.  What do you chop wood and stuff?  Do you do all that?  Only in the winter.  You have people to chop your wood, don't you?  Yeah, look at Maury.  He hasn't had a haircut in two months.  Two months.  How about haircut?  Maury's looking relaxed.  You can confirm to everybody because there's substantial numbers of people who think I wear a wig. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  You've got more hair than anyone in this studio.  Maury's got a nice full head of hair.  You look relaxed, too, after being on vacation for a while.  It's great.  What does a Maury do on vacation?  I watch my son fish.  He goes on the lake up there and fishes.  I mean, I'm not a fisherman, but I try to be interested in what he does.  What kind of fish does he go for?  He gets lake trout and white fish and things like that. 
[01:12:00]  He doesn't do that.  Well, everybody else does, you know, fly rods with all these, you know, going for the trout in the lakes and the rivers, you know, and the river runs through it.  He's out there with this big bowl trying to get 38-pound lake trout.  You don't get lost in the woods.  I was looking at the loons.  I was picking berries.  The kid learned to drive a car at 12.  See, if you have enough property out there, you just...  Yeah.  Yeah, just give him the car.  He's not going to run into anything anytime soon, right? 
[01:12:30]  Better not.  I hate fly fishing.  I've never done it, but it just looks ridiculous.  It's difficult.  I can do it, but it's difficult.  That looks hard.  You should fish.  But, you know, I'm the typical city guy who goes out fly fishing.  I have to have somebody else put the fly on.  I don't do that.  I know.  Yeah.  Like going out on a boat and dropping that line straight to the bottom and picking up some dinosaur from the bottom of the ocean.  That's what I like.  That's right.  They have that deep sea fishing.  Do you know that there are more dinosaur spottings in Montana than any other state?  Montana?  Yeah.  Really?  What are you smoking? 
[01:13:00]  Oh, you're talking like the fossils.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Could have made an old Maury joke there.  Yeah, right.  Only when Maury's on vacation.  Most dinosaur spotting.  I'm teasing, of course.  I thought Maury was seeing dinosaurs walking around.  What I want to get into immediately.  I've heard.  Cottonball, man.  Is your show.  This whole, not just Cottonball, man.  It's the whole thing.  Now, the paternity shows are fantastic.  Those things are through the roof.  People love them.  That's a soap opera in eight minutes.  It's amazing. 
[01:13:30]  The angry couple, one accusing the other of being, being, or not being the parent.  Right.  And then they drag them both out.  They argue for a while.  And then Maury comes out with the results and seals it.  That's it.  Here is definitive proof.  Right.  And they freak out.  The woman, if it's not the father, the woman runs off the stage.  Yep.  I immediately have to go and console her.  Yes.  And the guy does flips.  Flips dancing.  He's dancing around the stage that he's not the dad. 
[01:14:00]  And Maury's got to be, it's okay.  There, there, there.  Consoling Maury.  One of the best things on television.  In Maury's head, he's doing flips, too, because he's like, oh, man, this is good TV.  This is my ratings.  But, you know, it's great.  But there was one dramatic decision that we made early on, and I don't know why I made it.  I don't know the answers.  Oh, so you don't even know them until.  I don't know the answers until I open up the envelope.  That's kind of good.  And it's the same thing on cheating. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know the answers to that stuff.  Have you gotten good at speculating just by looking at the people?  It's the pause.  Yeah.  You know, that moment when I open the envelope, and I know, but nobody else does.  Have you gotten good, though?  Have you gotten like.  Yeah, it's a Jack Benny pause.  It's pretty good.  You kind of know.  You go, I know this guy's the father.  I know it.  But I get, I get, I get surprised all the time.  Really?  Oh, absolutely.  You can't figure it out until you open the envelope.  Yeah, because sometimes I'm positive.  I'm like, oh, that's got to be the kid. 
[01:15:00]  How about the woman?  I never slept with anybody else.  She took my virginity.  Yeah, yeah.  You are not the father.  Yeah.  How is she just lying there?  Immaculate conception.  She went to the dentist.  Good call back there, Bobby.  Now, I got to talk about the fear shows.  Cottonball.  Cottonball.  These shows that.  Cottonball, man.  You have people facing their fears.  Before that, though, the primordial dwarf thing.  I just want to point out something.  Tyra Banks is now doing primordial dwarf.  She is. 
[01:15:30]  And the first thing I was saying is, ah, boy, he did that years ago.  He invented the primordial dwarf thing.  He discovered him.  He went to like some small island somewhere and discovered them.  We finished those shows like in year four.  Yeah.  We're in year 20.  Yeah, yeah.  And what we love is how you played hide and seek.  We got to bring up the hide and seek again.  I love that one.  Hit him in the cabinets and in the wastebaskets.  Come on, now.  But she wanted his Tammy.  Where is she?  I'm over here, Maury.  Oh, you're in the bookcase.  Anthony, you remember that bit. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, I loved it.  It's one of our favorites.  I loved it.  She's in the bookcase with all Maury's Emmys.  Hiding behind all of my Emmys.  I loved it.  And I'm like, no, he put her in a bookcase.  That's a long time ago.  Oh, yeah.  That was a while ago.  I'm tired of thinking she discovered something new.  You know, that must have.  That happened in Opie and Anthony 1, I think.  Yes, phase one.  Phase one.  That happened before our first firing.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a while ago. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, but talking about that, I see your buddy's coming back.  Imus.  Yeah, Don Imus.  I mean, yeah.  We work for the company that fired him, so we can't be too excited.  Bad Imus.  Bad.  Bad Imus.  Oh, that wasn't good what you did.  That $20 million they paid out could have gone to our show.  Now we can't get anything.  No advertising budget for us.  The only thing I was surprised at was I didn't know he was making that little.  They paid him, it looks like half of what they owed him. 
[01:17:00]  So, you know, we're happy for Imus.  The I-man.  And he'll be back doing his thing.  Lucky, lucky best.  How do you do that?  But more, you got to...  It's like me, it's like, you know, I always wanted Geraldo to return, and he never did.  No, never came back.  Unless he left talk.  What's it?  He wanted to go legit, and no one's ever heard of him since.  Off to, uh, yeah.  When you open a safe and there's nothing in it, eh.  That was one of the biggest faux pas on television.  I don't know what he did after that, to be honest with you.  Well, he gave away our positions to the enemy on Fox News, I do remember that one, where 
[01:17:30]  he drew in the sand in Iraq, where the enemy positions were in Afghanistan.  See, I always wanted Donahue to come back.  See, there are a lot of fossils.  Yeah.  Not only in Montana, but elsewhere.  Didn't he try to come back?  He came back on MSNBC for a little bit, and then he was, like, too political for them  or something.  I think you guys are kind of, you know, in there.  Like, you got this niche where you're in there, and it's kind of hard to bring people  back, because it's like, what?  He's so, God, it's so old news and everything. 
[01:18:00]  Well, you see that, I have, I want to go out.  Here, I have one hero on this.  Mm-hmm.  I want to go out the way Carson went out.  Oh, yeah.  Once you leave, nobody ever sees you again.  That's it.  You do not appear.  They want to give you, they want to give Carson all these special awards.  Right.  Bring them back.  Do this big special.  A cameo on the Oscars.  Yes.  Do this special thing.  He refused everything.  The only thing he did, when Letterman started, he walked out on the stage, sat down. 
[01:18:30]  Do you remember this?  No.  He sat down at Letterman's desk.  At CBS.  And kind of, like, looked around and said, nah, nah, and then got up and left.  That was an amazing thing.  That was the last, and that was the only thing he ever did.  And that must have been 15 years ago.  Yeah, when Letterman went to 1130.  But Carson did walk out on that stage basically to show, look, he's my successor.  And we love Leno, but, you know, that's what Carson did for Letterman.  Well, they said he was kind of forced out, Jake, Jay's manager or whatever, the NBC kind  of forced Carson out.  So why would he go back and take awards for them when he probably felt like he got squeezed  out?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  NBC would call him up every year.  Like, Johnny, we want to do a special show right in sweeps, of course.  And Carson said, I'm out.  I made a, I swore to myself, I would never appear again.  Done.  Oh, he's rich.  The guy must have made 80, 90 grand a year.  Hey, perhaps more than that, Jim.  Did you get the DVD set of Carson?  Yeah, it's amazing.  No, I just watched the commercials.  Yeah, you watch the commercials.  It's pretty much everything.  No, it really is amazing.  Oh, it's great.  Great box set.  I remember watching that on the way to San Francisco, and I had to take the, I was such 
[01:19:30]  a blubbering zilch when Bette Midler was singing to him at the end, and I had to take my headphones  off because I was tearing up on the plane.  Oh, Jimmy's sensitive.  But she's not crying.  She's looking at me like, you, Nancy, how do I sleep with you?  It was really sad.  Hey, so you got our attention again, Maury, because the fear shows we can't get enough  of.  Yeah.  The phobias.  The phobias.  The phobias.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering, did you consult with maybe a psychiatrist, a psychologist?  Therapist. 
[01:20:00]  To see if this really is the best way to cure people of their phobias.  I heard that, Anthony.  You know, you have a good point there.  Yeah, because I'm kind of like.  Just shock them.  I'm shocked them.  With a seven foot tall cotton ball, man.  Cotton ball, man.  This woman that's afraid of a single cotton ball would throw her into a tizzy.  You don't start with the cotton ball 20 feet away from the room, from her in a room  with a therapist going, there it is.  Now, calm down.  Calm down.  You, you attack her with a cotton monster.  And I, and I want to tell you something, I don't know where they're coming from, so 
[01:20:30]  I figure if, you know, he's coming out in one, on one wing of the stage, okay, I'll handle  that.  And she runs the other way.  And we got a, you know, we got an entry, one in one A over there, the other side.  Uh-huh.  And there's another guy.  Dressed up.  As cotton ball, man.  But the best part, Maury, is that you're mocking them.  You're laughing your ass off.  I'm not mocking them.  I'm not mocking them.  And you think it's hilarious that they're in there. 
[01:21:00]  Could I drag them on the show?  No.  Haven't they seen other phobia shows?  I would think they would.  Aren't we just answering these desperate letters?  You don't have to.  Very good.  Wait, you don't have to laugh so hard.  Let me play Maury.  The laughter is killer.  Hold on.  I love it.  Come on.  Defend yourself here.  Let me play the Andrea, who's afraid of birds.  And Maury, you just kind of bring out one lousy bird.  But listen to Maury.  Just listen to Maury losing his mind in this clip.  We have to have you face your fears, Andrea. 
[01:21:30]  Let's bring out the birds.  Ominous music.  And you go, and your voice changes.  Bring out the birds.  Bring out the birds.  Bring out the birds.  It sounds like a guy trying to get to first base on a date.  Like, oh, listen, this is what you do.  Bring out the birds.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a second, Andrea.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're sick. 
[01:22:00]  Wait a minute, Andrea.  She wants out of the situation.  Like, no way.  I need good TV.  Get back here.  I love it.  Two of the people jumped the entire grandstand in the audience.  I mean, jumped over the grandstand.  Oh, yeah.  Thankfully, of course, they signed this waiver.  You guys know how to work these things.  Don't do this.  It's one little bird.  It's one little bird.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  She's losing her mind.  Now, of course, here's the worst part. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Many viewers, people in the audience, think it's fake.  Really?  They think this is all staged.  You can't stage stuff like this.  She's losing her mind.  Who said on our show they thought it was fake?  I'm like, this is not fake.  Lori finds these crazies.  I'm telling you, none of it.  You can't stage that stuff.  No.  She is hyperventilating.  She's screaming.  And we got medics all over the place.  Oh, do we?  Just in case someone drops.  Of course.  Lori doesn't need lawsuits.  We got EMTs. 
[01:23:00]  On every side of the god.  There's no therapist, but there's medics in case she dies.  Yeah, it's really EMT.  Consulting physician, Mengele.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm ran.  I'm ran.  One bird.  One bird.  One bird.  A pterodactyl.  Oh, my God.  Listen to her.  You think she's getting out?  You think she's acting out? 
[01:23:30]  I don't think so, man.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I proved myself right.  Basically, he wants to say, isn't this great TV?  Exactly.  I think so.  Then, of course, there was the pickle lady.  And that showed up on YouTube forever.  Yep.  Yep.  Pickle lady afraid of pickles.  If you don't know, the mustard, the mustard lady, scared of mustard and not, I'll say this.  She did have an every man attitude.  It was French's mustard she was afraid of.  Wow.  Not Grey Poupon. 
[01:24:00]  Not afraid of Grey Poupon.  Just French's mustard.  And, of course, we bring out this breaking tray.  We have, no, we have mustard man, you know, in a squeeze bottle.  No, no, no, we don't know.  No!  You should have done a little Nickelodeon thing and just, like, drop the mustard from the sky  on the poor person.  What was the reasoning?  Did she give a reason?  It was the color.  The color of mustard got her.  And she didn't like, you know, when you take the squeeze bottles and the sound it makes 
[01:24:30]  when you push it on a hot dog or something like that?  Yeah.  It just sounds like a fart.  Yeah, sure.  So, anyway, that was mustard lady was big.  We got the pickle audio.  Pickle.  Oh, gosh.  Mariah describes her fear of pickles.  Maury sends her to a pickle factory.  Maury asks why she's so afraid.  Oh.  All right.  And then, of course, you have to bring out a giant plate of pickles.  The really big ones, you know, in the old days, the ones that were in the barrel.  Yeah.  The big, scary pickles. 
[01:25:00]  Or you can't get your hand out of the jar when you're trying to get your pickle.  You don't have to be a shrink to figure out why it's, you know, it's pickles with mozzarella  balls.  They just terrify me.  But how about the coach, you know, spends 13 minutes with them.  And they're cured.  Cured of their pickle phobia.  Sure they are, Maury.  You don't think so?  No.  No?  No.  I think it goes a little deeper.  I think like Jimmy was saying.  I think if a girl is afraid of pickles, she probably also doesn't like razor stubble and 
[01:25:30]  whiskey breath late in the night.  Something tells me.  She also doesn't like hot dogs.  Yeah, hot dogs.  But we can be cruel.  We can be cruel.  No.  Yeah.  My personal, my former personal assistant, a great woman named Sarah Drew, was scared  of mice.  And unbeknownst to her, we brought the mice in.  Taped it.  She went nuts.  Taped it, of course.  Look at Maury.  He loves this.  Maury, you.  Afraid of anything?  You got a phobia of anything?  Snakes.  Snakes.  But that's what everybody is.  Let's bring the snakes on. 
[01:26:00]  Look at the snakes.  That'd be great.  My son, now, my 12-year-old, he loves snakes.  I hate snakes.  Yeah.  Snakes, not fun.  Not good.  Montana, any poisonous snakes?  No, actually, not in my area.  No?  But there are a lot of rattlers elsewhere.  Yeah.  Not in my place.  My son sees some snakes.  When he was about six, he saw the snake, and he has a six-year-old friend next to him.  And he says, stay here.  I'm going to get my net.  I want to capture the snake.  He's going up for a butterfly net.  And the girl's going crazy. 
[01:26:30]  And the snake slithers away.  And the girl's going nuts.  And my son comes back and is ready to kill her because the snake's gone.  And then he went, Dad, I got a great idea for shows.  Right.  You scare the crap out of girls.  When do you start taping the new season?  Like a week from today.  Are we going to do something?  You ready?  Well, we did it before, right?  Yeah.  Oh, and by the way, I see you got the cell from South Park.  You're going to auction off.  What happened? 
[01:27:00]  No.  I sent you a member of South Park.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A member of South Park.  Oh, that's hanging in my new place.  Oh, really?  Iraq's got it.  You were supposed to auction that thing off.  Iraq's got it.  Is that what you did with all the Katrina stuff?  Here it is, right here.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Just use it.  Honestly, we raised a very good amount of money.  We did pretty good for the victim.  $55,000, somebody told me.  Yeah.  $55,000 is more than that.  What happened to this?  This was supposed to be auctioned off.  He's right.  You're going to do that.  You've got to find the next cause.  We didn't sell it because it wasn't signed by Maury. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, we've got to sign now.  We held on to it.  Oh, well, now.  My best, Maury Povich.  That's a real, you know.  That's when South Park did this classic show on us.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And it's a sell from that actual show.  In fact, I called them up right afterwards, and they said they wouldn't answer my call.  They thought I was going to sue them.  So I said, they finally answered.  I said, yes, Mr. Povich.  I said, look, can you send me some of those cells that you made this show from?  I would love to have them in my office. 
[01:28:00]  So they sent us some.  So what are we?  We got new stuff, but I don't know what it is.  See, as soon as I leave you, I go down, the producer tells me.  But we've got to have something new.  I mean, we've been living off our rep for so long.  Yep, yep.  Some new stuff.  Yeah.  Well, you tape, how many shows do you tape?  Do you tape like five or six a week?  We do six a week.  Two a day, three days a week.  Usually Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.  Wow.  That's a nice schedule.  The most diverse studio audience.  Yes, indeed.  Indeed.  In fact, NBC, you know, owns us. 
[01:28:30]  So they wanted to move the show to 30 Rock.  I said, I don't think you want my diverse audience up there at 30 Rock.  It really is.  How do you?  It doesn't, you know, fit with that NBC.  How do you get such a full audience like that, too?  They love it.  They bust in there.  They just, it's amazing.  They come from all over the country, but a lot of them are local, and they just love  to come down.  Yeah.  That's great.  The worst audience, Ant and I saw, we were on John McEnroe's Vail Talk Show.  Oh, were you?  Oh, my God, yeah.  You were on that?  Well, technically we were.  Yeah, like the last show, I think. 
[01:29:00]  But if you're on a show and no one saw you, then were you really on the show?  Let's be honest.  Twilight Zone.  But we walked out, right?  And these people had no clue who we were.  They bust them in.  Half of them looked like they were recovering from some kind of drug overdose.  My guys are like my best friends.  They call me Murray.  Come on.  Right.  I love you, Murray.  Yo, Murray.  Murray.  Let me tell you.  I could do a whole bit.  You know, that's it.  That's what I got to do.  www.themaurishow.com where all this stuff, you can see all this stuff.  I'm going to just a litany of all the mispronunciations of my name. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, that is good.  Yeah.  By my favorite people in the audience.  By the audience.  Murvy.  Murray.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So we'll have to figure out something for you.  We could send a bunch of our guys.  Yeah, we'd like to do something.  We could send a bunch of our guys your way.  We've got some freaks.  Big A.  You've got to do something with Big A, man.  Yeah, Big A you can do something with.  Make a little makeover and maybe a night out.  Yeah.  Well, that's why the paternity shows have gotten so big because one of my friends told me,  he says he plays golf and he was in the caddyshack and all the caddies are watching the show 
[01:30:00]  on the tube in the caddyshack and one guy was saying to the other,  anybody ever accuse you of being the father of your child?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  All the time?  I mean, back home, people say, oh, yeah, all the time they accuse me of being the father  of their babies.  Well, what do you do?  I says, I tell them all the same thing.  Well, what do you tell them?  He says, I ain't the daddy till Murray tells me I'm the daddy.  Have you been around longer than Springer and Montel?  Briefly.  I mean, like when I say maybe a half a year to a year, I started, they had one of these 
[01:30:30]  slow rollouts, you know, where you start in part of the country, but not all the country.  And that happened the same year that I went full blast.  That was 17, 18 years ago.  Wow.  You did all the gossip shows, too.  Oh, yeah.  Current Affair.  Current Affair, of course.  Yeah.  That was...  You started all that.  You remember the first Marty show, what the subject matter was?  It was really bad.  Was it?  Yeah.  Really?  It was just so boring. 
[01:31:00]  You've got to kind of get into, you know, and feel where the show has to go.  When should you talk to your child about sex?  Oh, boy.  Was that the first show?  Something like that.  Something like that.  And I'm wearing a suit, tie, you know, all dressed up.  The Tom Brokaw view of Tom.  Well, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  You also do the shows where the teens gone wild.  They're the...  Where they are just out of control teens. 
[01:31:30]  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  They're backstage.  I love the backstage camera where they're just mouthing off to the camera, showing how  hot they are.  Right.  Then I bring out D-West.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just, like, talks all kinds of crap to them.  Those girls, you just want to grab them by the throat and smack them in the face.  Exactly.  And the parents of the mother is just crying.  And all the mothers in the audience are going, you give me three minutes for that kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like the mother's crying. 
[01:32:00]  You're like, Murray, Murray, she beats me up.  We have fights.  I'm like, how does this girl beat this woman up?  I know.  Or the little ones, you know, the ones that weigh 75 pounds.  Yeah.  They're 13.  They haven't had a morsel in their mouth for two years.  And the mother, who, by the way, is bigger than this couch.  Yeah.  Always.  Why don't you tell them that the show is going to be Teens Gone Wild, but then call it Horrible  Parents.  Right.  And sit them down and yell at the parents why they're not parenting these children. 
[01:32:30]  Because our parents wouldn't allow it.  Oh, my God, if I even mouthed off once.  It was over.  It was over.  And I would not do it again.  Yeah.  I don't understand how they sit there crying, going, she won't do it.  And then the kid comes out, yells at the audience, and the audience yells back, and  then starts yelling at the mother.  Right.  And the mother cries, see, see, Mikey, she just yells at me all the time.  Mervie.  Mervie. 
[01:33:00]  Listen, we got to take a break.  All right.  We got Rob Zombie here as well.  Yeah.  I mean, you could hang Maury.  What do you want to do?  I got to go.  Why?  Maury's a nutty man.  I got to get my hair colored.  Don't make it too dark on TV.  It's getting a little creepy.  You think so?  Yeah.  It looks great.  It looks great right now.  A little salt and pepper.  Yeah.  Tell him to do a little salt and pepper job for you.  Distinguished.  Distinguished.  You got the girls trying to come on to Maury.  A couple of the girls going, hey, Maury.  Hey, he's a married man.  He's very well known to be married.  I'm not saying that he's doing anything. 
[01:33:30]  I'm just saying.  So you got any groupies?  Maury groupies?  No.  Yeah, a little.  You got a nice distinguished look.  You got a power base there.  I bet you're lying.  By the way.  Well, we have a videotape of you.  I love the show you did with your wife there.  I know it didn't do too well, but I was watching it.  Oh, the MSNBC.  That was the show.  I watched it every week.  Then, of course, the problem is, you know, so she gives this.  She can't sing a lick.  Oh, my God.  I remember that right.  We haven't talked to Maury since then. 
[01:34:00]  Remember that?  The song that she sang at the end.  To say goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks for the memories.  It was too brief, the song, though.  It was too brief.  She did the fabulous Baker Boys falling off the piano.  Oh, yeah.  And everybody thought that she had, like, imploded.  Yeah.  That she had gone nuts.  Exactly.  And they start writing these stories about what has happened to Connie Chung.  Well, I would call people to watch the show on, when was it on?  On the weekend or something, right?  It was on the weekend.  Saturday or Sunday.  Come here.  Come here.  I don't think they know they're on TV. 
[01:34:30]  You've got to watch those things.  That was pretty much the gist of the show.  Exactly.  I was like, do they really like people watching this?  Is this a hidden camera show?  Everybody goes crazy.  Leno had the best bit.  He brings Connie on to explain the song that she sang.  And Connie says, well, I can sing off-key perfectly.  And Leno goes, and you've mastered it.  You guys both have a great sense of humor.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun.  And you can tell you guys have a really nice relationship.  But it was fun to watch.  It was great.  Well, that's what happens when people that are legitimate news people for so many years 
[01:35:00]  show that they're human and have a sense of humor.  All of a sudden, it's like, they're off their rockers.  Of course.  Lost their minds.  Yeah.  They have no sense.  You can't show that emotion.  Was there ever a weird thing?  This is like, because she is a very legitimate, quote, unquote, journalist.  Was there ever a time where she said, look, what are you doing?  I'm an anchor.  Why are you dragging me into your world?  She would look at me funny sometimes.  Yeah.  Don't take me down this road.  Was there ever anything weird? 
[01:35:30]  No.  No.  Hey, we're running really late.  Thanks, guys.  Maury, we can hang with you all morning.  Thanks so much.  Let's do this.  Let's do it like a home and home.  A thing.  A thing, man.  All right.  Absolutely.  Good to see you all.  We'll throw some ideas by you.  See what you want to do.  Check your, as my PR people would say, check your local listings.  Local listings.  The orange show.  Some big markets, they're on three times a day.  Just like Opie and Anthony on XM Radio.  All right.  It's Maury Povich, everyone.  Rob Zombie next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[01:36:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Greetings.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Rob Zombie making his way into studio.  Tracy leaving the studio.  Oh, I can't even look at her.  What's the matter?  You were a mess.  I don't know.  She just does it for me.  And by the way, she said there are 38 C's because someone said she had 38 double D's  or something like that.  I said 36 double D's.  36 double D's and 38 full C's. 
[01:36:30]  She could have one that's an A and one that's a double E and I'd still like her.  Yeah.  Rob Zombie, everybody.  Hi, Rob.  Hello.  Rob.  We haven't talked to you in many, many years.  We go way back.  We used to talk to you when we were at WAF, but I don't think you would remember that.  Yes, I do.  And then we talked to you when we were doing afternoons for a while.  Yeah, it was a while ago, though.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  We've had a few screw-ups since then.  Been around.  Shuffled around.  Always land on our feet. 
[01:37:00]  I'm very jealous of his friendship with Tom Papa.  Tom's a comedian.  Really?  You are?  Oh, it makes me sick.  I want to wreck it.  Because Tom's like the cleanest cut comic.  He's like, you know, he tours with Seinfeld.  He's like a Letterman guy.  And him and Zombie are really close.  And it really bugs me.  How did that happen?  How did you meet Tom Papa?  I don't know, but everyone keeps asking me that.  That was like a big topic yesterday, too.  Like, how would you know Tom Papa?  And it's a simple...  I couldn't even remember how I knew Tom Papa, because I was kind of thinking, like, yeah,  why do I know Tom Papa?  You're saying the same thing.  Why would I know Tom Papa? 
[01:37:30]  Tell me you're going to lose your number.  We both flew across country to this...  Not together, but we ended up at this wedding together that was so boring that we just started  talking.  And, you know, we just sort of bonded over the misery of being at this wedding.  And then we, you know...  It's all it takes sometimes.  He's a funny guy.  Yeah, he's a really good comic, but it bothers me that somebody I'm friends with is friends  with a rock star that I like.  Well, Jimmy, you being a comic also, you would think that you would have friends like that.  You have, like, Sully from Godsmack. 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  As a friend of yours.  Yes, he is.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Has no idea I'm alive.  You know...  Now, Sully's all insulted.  You said you don't know any rock stars, so he's like...  No, Sully, I'm an Ozzy fan, and I watched him the other night, he performed on the top  of the hard rock.  And me and Florentine stood for an hour and 20 minutes and waited for him to come out the  side door.  Really?  Like, what's wrong with me?  You already have...  Like a kid.  I know!  You already have pictures with him?  You have every single thing you could possibly have of Ozzy.  There's nothing...  Rob, we gotta explain. 
[01:38:30]  I mean, he has to get pictures with everybody that's famous, and Ozzy especially.  He's like an Uber fan.  He's got multiple photographs with Ozzy.  He's got...  We go with him.  Audio.  He's got...  How many do you need?  Exactly.  Thank you.  Where's this going?  It's not happening.  Thank you.  You're not going to become friends with him.  Yeah, there's nothing...  How many times?  Thank you, Rob.  That is his fantasy.  That is his fantasy.  He doesn't want any friends.  This is what I want.  But Rob is right.  Where is this going is pretty much what I was saying to myself at 1130 at night.  I'm 39. 
[01:39:00]  And I'm waiting for a British alcoholic to walk out so I can just go, hi, remember me?  I didn't think you would.  Take care.  He even has a picture with all of Black Sabbath when they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But here's what I want from Ozzy.  I want Ozzy to one time walk out, and I'll go, hey, and they'll go, hey, Jim, and keep  going.  That's all I want.  It'll never happen.  I know.  You could be on tour with him for a year, and it would, you know...  You've given him a new hope, though.  He's hoping someday it's like, Jimmy, isn't this a boring wedding? 
[01:39:30]  It's so boring.  And it's mine.  I'm right.  You don't whore.  Sit down, Oz.  Let's get out of here.  Tom Papa will come in and C-block you from him, too.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe Tom Papa, you know, he'll hang out with you.  Yeah, he'll hook you up.  Hey, you do...  I'm really...  I'm also...  This is another thing that makes me very jealous and sick is that you get to work with Malcolm  McDowell, who's one of my all-time idols, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  You get it bad, don't you?  Yeah.  I'm just an envious total fanboy.  Did you...  Who does he play?  Does Malcolm McDowell play the Donald Pleasance boy?  Yeah, he plays Dr. Loomis.  Oh, wow.  We're talking about Halloween, obviously. 
[01:40:00]  We should be going up to speed.  The remake of Halloween, directed by Rob Zombie.  Are you considering it a remake, or is it a new vision?  I don't know.  Everything's just a new term for the same thing.  It's a remake, I guess.  There's a lot of new content, so a remake makes it sound like, you know, it's like a  shot-for-shot redo, which it's not, so...  It's...  But, you know, it's the same story.  Yeah.  We have a lot more backstory and a lot more stuff added.  What about, I gotta ask you, the Captain Kirk mask?  Is that still part of the...  Yeah, we...  I mean, that's really the only... 
[01:40:30]  You know, if you lose that...  It's constant, yeah.  Well, what the hell is it?  No, we...  It's like Jason making a new Friday the 13th with a catcher's mask on or something.  You should have it, yeah, a William Shatner mask of what he looks like today.  Yeah, but today it's the Priceline Shatner mask.  Right, right.  Age the mask like Shatner aged.  Why Halloween?  Like, when did you say, all right, this is a movie I just want to redo?  Or do...  Well, I didn't...  I never thought about it before.  It just was one of those opportunities that came up, and somebody offered it to me, and at  first, I didn't want to do it. 
[01:41:00]  I just thought maybe it was kind of a stupid idea.  But, you know, I went away and thought about it for a couple months and came up with a  way that I thought it could be done.  You'd do it differently, and then, you know, what the hell?  Jumped in on it.  Why is it coming out?  When's it not coming out on Halloween?  It's coming out in September, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  August 31st?  August 31st, it comes out.  I mean, I don't know.  That's fine with me.  If you come out...  I think that's smart, because then you'll get another little boost at the box office right  around Halloween.  Yeah, I mean, if it came out on Halloween by November 1st, everybody's like, eh, I'm over it.  Yeah, you're done with Halloween stuff.  Yeah, you're sick of it. 
[01:41:30]  I always thought that it was stupid to have these movies come out right a couple days  before Halloween.  That's why every Christmas movie comes out in November, because if it came out on Christmas  the next day, once Christmas is over, it's over.  Nobody's going to see the Santa Claus 3.  It's the build-up to the holiday, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  December 26th.  It's the Santa Claus 3.  All right, good.  I'll show you that I'm in show business for 17 years, and I know nothing.  Why not just release it on the same night?  All the kids will go.  Explains the Aussie scenario.  Is it the same music?  Is the same music in it?  The same theme?  Some of it, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we took the same music and redid it a little bit, so it's a little different, 
[01:42:00]  but it's pretty close.  Rocked it up a little bit?  Not really, because whenever we tried to jazz it up or anything, it sounded kind of like cheesy.  Oh, really?  It's so simple and so perfect that when you kind of try to overdo it, yeah, when you  overdo it, you go like, why are they ruining something that's perfect?  So we kind of left it the same, and then we tried to do other new cues that had the  same vibe.  Did you do any cameos?  Did you get any Jamie Lee Curtis face in there or anything?  No, no.  Playing the teacher or something?  I love when they do that.  I didn't want to do that. 
[01:42:30]  Good.  I hate that.  It breaks the reality.  You're watching the movie, then you go, oh, why did they?  I don't need that.  Awful movie that I thought was awful, the remake of Lost in Space, which is just horrible.  And they had a cameo of everyone that was still alive from Lost in Space, and it does.  It just takes you right out of it.  You're like, oh, there she is.  There's the mother, and there's Adam Warner.  They had to throw her a bone.  Yeah.  Major West.  Look, he's playing some guy that isn't Major West. 
[01:43:00]  He's playing an old guy.  I'm just imagining his version of Halloween, a lot of hot chicks, right?  Well, then, yeah, of course.  A lot of busty, busty, hot teenage girls.  Bodacious, busty broads.  It's hard to find normal girls to be in a movie.  Yeah.  It is.  I always liked the regular normal, like, girl next door chicks in those movies.  We're always better than the busty blonde.  Oh, yeah, no.  I tried to find people that looked normal, because you watch that, and you're like, oh, it's  Haddonfield, Illinois, and here's the high school girls. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Like, you're all out of Hollywood.  Or they have a lot of plastic surgery in Illinois.  How violent is it?  Because you seem to like gore.  It's not that gory, but it's pretty violent.  More than the original?  Yeah.  But, I mean, the original is pretty tame when you watch it now.  Gore doesn't get people these days as much as this weird kind of suspense, jump out at  you, crap.  Like, things that scared me, I'll tell you what petrified me was The Ring.  Yeah.  Either the original Japanese version or even the remake, American version. 
[01:44:00]  That kind of crap that, like, just comes out at you, or that old-time black-and-white weird  movement.  Yeah.  I mean, gore's not that scary.  No.  And if it's too much, it's laughable.  Yeah.  People start laughing.  Yeah.  No, I kept that to a minimum, and I just kind of, you know, want it to be real.  You know, so it's just the actors selling the scares and the suspense.  Yeah.  Also, you don't want to see the monster too much.  When you start seeing the monster too much in a movie, it takes you out.  You're like, you want to be surprised when he's just jumping out of nowhere. 
[01:44:30]  That was the best part about Halloween, though.  You'd see him walk by a window.  Real fast.  And then you wouldn't see him for two minutes.  Yeah.  And you forgot that he walked by a window.  She didn't see him.  And then all of a sudden, he's right behind her with that mask.  Oh, my God.  And he never ran, but he caught everybody.  It was like, Michael Myers is the slowest walker ever.  He's like, and all of a sudden, she's running, and then five minutes later, he's right there  with that stupid, tilted head.  He was horrifying.  That's how he knows all the shortcuts.  Yeah.  He runs the wrong way.  He just kind of goes.  He's a speed walker.  That creepy outfit.  Yeah.  What scariest film you've ever seen, would you have to say? 
[01:45:00]  Scariest film?  I always thought Jaws was the scariest movie I've ever seen.  That was the only time I ever remember being scared.  But I was also in third grade, so.  The extras didn't scare you.  My girlfriend saw that recently with me.  She'd never seen it.  And then she's like, no, it was good, but it wasn't scary.  Nobody ever thinks anything's scary.  It's annoying.  I'll fess up to being petrified at a lot of movies.  I can't even take ads on TV.  It's late at night.  It's dark.  I'm thumbing through the channels.  And then that stupid, the grudge ad came on.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  And I was like, goddamn little kids.  And those two girls in The Shining, every time.  I cannot look at them way down the hall.  That Kubrick shot of them way down the hall.  Come play with us, Danny.  Whoa.  I can't look.  The first half of The Shining is just scary.  That's all.  Yeah.  Well, so does the second half.  Well, I thought the second half is more funny.  Grady and him in that bathroom scene is a scream.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside party into this situation. 
[01:46:00]  I thought the first half was really scary because of the whole transformation of his character.  And then he was what he was for the second half, like a complete lunatic.  But watching him losing his mind in the middle of this hotel.  I saw it recently.  And the way Grady changes in that bathroom, of course, it starts out with,  Oh, let me get that hole from you, sir.  And then when he's like, you know, you chopped up your wife and kids.  And then Grady knows the jig's up.  It's like over.  And then he just gets this attitude like, you know, you know what you have to do. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Perhaps a bit more.  Needs a talking to.  I like a talking to or perhaps a bit more.  Either have a chat or chop him into pieces.  And the beautiful thing is that Nicholson catches him.  He goes, no, no, no.  You chopped your wife and daughter up.  And then you blew your brains out.  Like, aha.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Like Grady's going to go, you're right.  I did commit suicide.  Let me get the avocado off the jacket.  Thanks for mentioning it.  That was one of the classics.  Hey, we should change gears slightly here.  You know how we were talking about Ozzy with Jimmy Norton? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  He's an uber fan of Ozzy.  Yep.  We have an uber fan of Rob Zombie in this room right now.  And you met him.  Oh, yeah.  It's the same thing that you were saying about Jimmy.  It's not even a joke.  But you don't have an Ozzy tattoo, do you?  No.  This guy has been freaking out about this.  This is Sam.  This is Sam.  This is Sam.  Our own.  Hello.  Yes.  And think how he was panicking because my girlfriend had a gallbladder surgery last night. 
[01:47:30]  So I was calling up everybody going, look, I might not make it into the show.  And when I don't make it into the show, we usually don't do the show because it's kind  of awkward and stuff.  So this show was almost going to be canceled and his little heart was going to break if  he didn't get to meet you or see you here today.  We met before.  Yeah.  We met at Comic-Con.  And I remember.  Oh, look at that.  Wow.  Unlike the Ozzy scenario.  Yeah.  I, yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  Hello, Jim.  Well, it doesn't get any.  Hello, Jim. 
[01:48:00]  And then there's someone he knows named Jim behind you.  Not you.  In Sam's eye.  Move, you're blocking Jim.  Yeah, Jim, get this blue guy out of the way.  In Sam's eyes, though, it doesn't get any bigger than you, Rob.  Yep.  It's true.  Right?  There's no one bigger in your mind.  What about Vince McMahon?  Yeah, Vince.  That's true.  Rob, zombie beats Vince McMahon.  Wow.  It's true.  I don't have a Vince McMahon tattoo.  Tattoo.  Today's the one day you don't have a zombie shirt on.  He wears zombie shirts every day. 
[01:48:30]  I went through my whole closet.  Have we seen his tattoo?  You don't want to overdo it.  Have we seen his tattoo?  Have we seen your tattoo?  I've never seen it.  Where is it?  He has to take his pants off.  Your arm?  Yeah.  That twig?  That's the.  You're hiding it behind the mics.  Look at that.  Do you know what that reminds me of?  When Bart Simpson got a tattoo.  Yeah.  And it was inappropriate because it was a child.  What was Bart's tattoo?  Something weird.  Yeah, it was something weird.  Mother, I think.  Was it mother?  Oh, just a moth.  A moth.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, right.  Stop. 
[01:49:00]  And that's it.  Where'd you get the autograph to it?  Well, he did an autograph signing when he came out with Educated Horses in Times Square.  Yeah.  And I signed with a tattoo gun.  Well, now that's terminus.  Separates the real fans.  I said, oh boy, we're going to be here a while.  It's been 10 hours and he's only on the second person.  Look how rosy his cheeks are right now.  Oh, yeah.  I had to drive home from Syracuse because that's when I was going to school.  Yeah.  Just for the one day.  Like, I drove home that morning so I could get there. 
[01:49:30]  I had my girlfriend wait online at the Virgin store with all the people for a bracelet.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's just like, he's never liked it.  Wow, I love seeing this.  And then so, you know, I finally decided at the last minute that I would just ask him to sign my arm.  And then we went to the concert, which is the Nokia Theater, right after it.  And so I had to take another day off school to go to the tattoo shop as soon as it opened the next day and get it signed. 
[01:50:00]  And you went, go right over this.  And by the way, Sam.  Don't you screw up.  Your hero doesn't eat like an eight-year-old.  You know, you should change your eating habits.  You know, someone that's into Rob Zombie like this, you'd think you'd eat a little more, I don't know.  Cooler?  Cooler.  The guy eats like an eight-year-old.  He eats like an eight-year-old child.  This guy eats just like an eight-year-old.  Like Anja said.  How is that?  I don't remember how an eight-year-old eats.  Well, watch.  We have no idea what he ate last night.  Sam, what did you have for dinner last night? 
[01:50:30]  It was an Elio's last night.  Elio's pizza.  And some more celery.  Celery sticks.  Celery sticks.  And he eats like fish sticks and chicken fingers.  Yeah.  And he eats like finger food that you give a little kid.  Right.  And they make a mess.  And he doesn't want to eat much.  And then he washes it down with a big glass of milk every night.  Big glass of milk.  And for dessert, he'll have like gummy cola bottles.  They taste like cola.  Wax tips.  But they're like gummy.  Yeah, wax tips. 
[01:51:00]  What was your dessert last night?  Drink whatever that was out of it.  We got more ice cream.  So I got to have ice cream last night.  Oh, sweet.  Any topping on there?  Sprinkles?  No, we still don't have any toppings in the house.  Oh, that's a shame.  We'll have to buy you something.  It's weird that you like Rob Zombie, like with Lionel Richie being your dad.  It's just weird, isn't it?  He does look like the head from the hello video.  Do you want to ask Rob?  The clay head that the blind girl made.  Oh, God, yeah.  Didn't even look like him.  Looked like Neanderthal man. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, Jesus.  But the whole point was, even though she's blind, she knew exactly what he looked like.  Goddamn.  Well, the guys prepared questions.  The caveman from the Geico ads.  The guys prepared questions for Sam to ask Rob Zombie.  Ah, thank God.  Look at his rosy cheek.  You're getting to talk to your hero in an equal setting.  Look at Rob.  He's like, oh, come on.  This isn't going to be good for anyone.  This is crap now.  Believe me.  It's different than the average interviewer, though.  We try to do things differently.  I'm glad he's a realist and not working this up to something good. 
[01:52:00]  Right, right.  This is going to be a lot of fun for everyone.  Rob, I want to apologize.  This is going to suck.  Rob's like, whatever.  Can you at least promote Halloween?  Halloween is coming out.  August 31st.  Go ahead, Sam.  These are questions.  How would you rate your remake of Halloween on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being really cool,  10 being ridiculously awesome?  11.  Wow. 
[01:52:30]  Why did you skip the...  Oh, you already know the answer to the first one?  Yeah.  The first one was, do you remember me?  Do you remember my tattoo?  But all right.  We have established that.  Yeah.  That's weird.  What do you think about the current direction of Hard Rock?  Oh, God.  It's coming back a little bit.  There was like a five-year period there.  No.  A little shaky.  Dude.  It's still pretty shaky.  Yeah.  What do you think?  My theory is that it all died with the grunge rock. 
[01:53:00]  Do you think Bret Michaels' new show is going to help?  The Rock of Love?  I don't know what is going to help Flava Flava, I guess.  Yeah.  Help him get more girls.  It's Flava Flava with a white guy.  I know.  He makes up with every chick on the show.  Just tongue kisses him off.  Rob, I happen to think Sam is getting to the bottom of a lot of things for you right  now.  Yeah, let's go.  Let's get to the issues.  Barrel.  Go ahead.  What do you look for in a friend?  Well, I look for someone who will stand outside a building in the rain waiting. 
[01:53:30]  By the side door.  Whether or not I'm there.  There you go.  There's a little clue for you.  Yeah.  So, what's next for Rob Zombie?  What a typical ass question.  What's next?  I'm going to get the hell out of here as fast as possible.  Good choice.  Actually, ask him the next one.  Okay.  What did you have for dinner last night? 
[01:54:00]  I had pizza.  Cool.  Wow.  We're on the same page.  Look at that.  But he went to a grown-up store for his pizza.  Pop some Elios in a toaster, three-year-old.  You like to make scary movies.  What scares Rob Zombie?  Well, this is doing a pretty good job.  I want an honest answer.  That small desk that separates everyone. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Go to the last question.  So, let's get him out of here.  Okay.  A very busy man.  Yeah.  Did you ask Maury Povich these questions?  The same ones.  Would you have been as successful if your name was Rob Vampire?  And he goes, not mine.  Not my question.  I want to still remain cool.  Sam is shaking.  I've never seen you nervous. 
[01:55:00]  Sam, hold your hand out straight.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  You are a mess.  When I went to Comic-Con in the press room, I tried to take a picture with my iPhone.  But it's hardly, you can't even tell because it's completely blurred.  We'll get a real picture hopefully for you.  Luckily, my girlfriend is there with a real camera.  You're doing some kind of tapping thing with your leg too, I'm noticing.  This is my one, I told him, this is my one vulnerability.  This is weird. 
[01:55:30]  He's holding on to the camera.  You are his kryptonite.  Walk out from there.  Someone catch him if he falls.  Look at him.  He's so vulnerable.  He's so vulnerable right now.  Did you get your picture today?  Yes, I did.  And what happened?  Well, yeah, I asked him.  Look at him shaking.  He's got to lean on something.  He's very uncomfortable.  Oh, is he uncomfortable?  This is great.  I asked him if you'd be so kind to sign the other two pictures I had with him and then asked 
[01:56:00]  him to sign the third one, at which point he asked if there was anything we were doing  in this picture that would make a difference.  Good for you.  Good for you, Ron.  Jeez, what an ass.  Well, let's get the pictures.  We'll compare.  Yeah.  Where are they?  Is there anything you want to ask, Ron, that you really want to know?  Yeah, one last question because we have to take a break here.  It's your own.  Yeah, sure.  What creatively did you get to do differently as a solo artist that you didn't get to do  when you left White Zombie? 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  As the lead singer of White Zombie.  Truthfully, I creatively sort of stayed the same.  I just didn't have to argue with everybody anymore.  Makes sense.  That's, you know.  How did you get all that dust off of you?  You used to be very dusty.  A little mini-vac.  Remember that time?  That was awesome.  All right, Rob, we got to take a break.  So Halloween.  Halloween when?  Coming out August 31st.  August 31st.  We're really excited about this remake.  We think it's going to, what I'm hearing, it's going to be just a smash. 
[01:57:00]  I'm very happy Malcolm McDowell was in it, too.  That's a great choice.  Awesome.  Yeah, you should get Malcolm McDowell.  He's not here when we're here.  He's here when we're off.  Anything else you want to say?  Websites?  Anything you need?  The only thing I get, actually, the reason I know Tom Popper is we did this animated movie  together.  Did Tom ever mention that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which made me also sick.  They were collaborating creatively.  Oh, that's right.  I remember him.  He was so upset about it.  He told me about this.  No, it's called The Haunted World of El Superbisto.  And Tom Popper plays El Superbisto, the alcoholic hero.  And Paul Giamatti plays the villain. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  Tom Popper is the best friends with Seinfeld.  Oh, he just falls right into it, doesn't he?  Oh, he just falls into this.  You know what?  I have to, like, kiss ass for months.  People still hate you.  Friends with Colin Quinn.  And he's a loser.  Who hangs with Clint Eastwood that you guys know?  Tom Popper.  Tom Popper.  Are you kidding me?  No.  What is this guy doing?  Clint Eastwood loves Tom so much that he has him do private parties.  Yeah.  He flies him out for private parties.  And they walk around.  Oh, no.  Trust me.  I've heard the Clint Eastwood stories.  What the hell is he doing?  Clint Eastwood walks around the ranch. 
[01:58:00]  Clint Eastwood and Clint making dinner together.  Yeah, they walk around the ranch together.  And Clint just tells Tom how funny he is and stuff.  I know Clint Eastwood and Rob Zombie.  My head's huge.  An interesting guy.  He's a very funny comedian.  But he's not offensive.  I love Tom Popper.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Rob.  It's always a pleasure.  Good to see you.  The movie comes out August 31st.  Halloween.  We're all going to go see that.  Word.  All right.  More to come.  It's Opie and Anthony.  If you're checking out Opie and Anthony, here's something for the people that just sat through  the commercials. 
[01:58:30]  We got a pair of tickets to the Virus Tour at the PNC Bank Art Center on Saturday, August  25th, featuring pretty much everyone that's in studio and another four or five guys, courtesy  of Blades of Glory on DVD, in stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th.  We'll take a random call for the tickets if you're in the New York, New Jersey area.  I think even if you're in Philly, you would drive up for this one.  Phone number 877-212-ONA if you want these tickets.  We'll give them out to a random caller.  There you go, fan. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Good morning.  Yeah.  We just kind of invited a bunch of guys in because we thought Anthony wasn't going to  make it in today.  And we were just going to come in and just screw around.  But Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm a trooper.  We talked about Phil Rizzuto's death.  Scooter.  The scooter.  You know how old he was?  I mean, we all remember him calling Yankee games, right?  Here in the New York area?  Yes.  How old was he?  Well, he was 90 when he died, but this is how long he was, like, calling baseball games. 
[01:59:30]  Listen to this.  Waiting to see if Maris is going to hit number 61.  Here's the windup.  Fastball hit deep to right.  Looking in.  Way back there.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Did a holy cow for Maris' 61st home run.  Wow.  That was a good call.  That was a good home run call.  And then this really fast before we move on from CW.  Rizzuto was an entertainer calling Yankee games, reading birthday greetings, and speaking 
[02:00:00]  about anything during the action.  High fly, and while it's in the air, happy birthday to Daphne Lappazan.  The young Greek boy back there, George Plattis, from Sheepshead Bay.  He wants to say hello to the boys at Castle Harbor, where he's, oh, that's going to be up the alley  for extra bases.  Oh, why don't I shut up?  That was pretty funny.  See, nowadays, all the baseball announcers, they have to be over the top professionals. 
[02:00:30]  You don't get that, like, personal touch like Rizzuto gave you.  You don't get that doddering.  Yeah, but I like the doddering, man.  Shut up.  I hate that.  He used to give, like, restaurant reviews, like, ah, I was at this restaurant in Brooklyn,  let me tell you.  If he'd look at the game, he'd see that maybe the pitcher's, you know, ready to pitch,  and he should shut up.  Nah, I liked it.  I really did.  Because it was different.  How many times do you need to hear he's, you know, pitching from the stretch?  Yeah.  Plus, the guy's looking like he might steal.  Plus, you're watching it, too, so you're like, I know what's really going on in this game. 
[02:01:00]  I want to hear some interesting talk.  You missed the wonderful call.  George Steinbrenner said that, uh, I guess heaven needed a shortstop.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I think heaven would pick a better shortstop.  He'd just kill Alex Rodriguez or something.  See?  Well, I mean.  He's not a shortstop.  He used to be.  I know.  He could play short in heaven.  In heaven, he'd probably be good.  Yeah, exactly.  Come on.  Who's playing now if he needs him?  Christopher Reeve? 
[02:01:30]  The ball has to be hit and bounce perfectly into his mouth.  And he has to spit it.  Hey, it's heaven.  Anything can happen.  Christopher Reeve doesn't walk in heaven?  No.  He's a lump in a chair.  He's got a really crappy wheelchair.  Oh, that would suck.  Oh, I'm in heaven and I can't.  What?  He always strikes out.  He's got a really lousy wheelchair with, like, a number of spray painted on the back, like  the ones at the airport.  That's all he's got.  All he does is whiff.  He's a loser there.  Once in a while, he'll walk because they're afraid of hitting the chair, so they'll just,  like, pitch around him.  But they always double him up easily. 
[02:02:00]  Easily.  Before we leave this part of the show, we should get into that Michael Vick lawsuit.  This guy is insane.  And I don't know, I don't even know why this made the papers, but some guy is suing Michael  Vick for 63 billion, trillion, trillion, billion, trillion, billion dollars.  Well, he wrote it out in relief.  Plaintiff seeks 63, and then it's followed by 3, 6, 9, 10, 11 zeros. 
[02:02:30]  11 zeros.  It's not even right.  Well, because the commas are, like, 63, comma, three zeros, comma, three zeros, comma,  three zeros, comma, then two zeros.  And then it says...  So it's really a trillion hundred.  Right.  63, and then all those zeros, and then it says in print, billion dollars.  So he wants that.  But he wants it backed by gold and silver, delivered via UPS.  What is he, a bond villain?  United States Parcel Service to the front gates of FCI, Williamsburg, South Carolina, collected 
[02:03:00]  from defendant Michael Vick.  It's hard to read this, because it's in his own handwriting, this complaint against Michael  Vick.  Delivered via UPS.  And someone wants UPS to put gold and silver, billions upon billions of dollars.  Hey, read this first part, the actual complaint there.  This suit is a Bivens action and civil rights violation by the Constitution, a laws of the 
[02:03:30]  United States, and federal tort claims inflicted by that included, but not limited to injury  to wildlife, conspiracy, illegal dogfighting, extortion, racketeering, gambling, copyright  infringement, identity theft, fraud, threats to commit violent acts, brutality, and tax  fraud.  And I always throw that tax fraud in there if you've got a lawsuit.  Just in case you can get them.  You're looking at paying taxes on all that that you just did. 
[02:04:00]  And then violated on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendment of the Constitution  for Relief Plaintiff Seek 63, whatever this tool is.  The 2nd Amendment?  He won 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.  Wait, the 5th Amendment?  Isn't that your right to not self-incriminate yourself?  And the 2nd Amendment, the 1st Amendment is freedom of speech. 
[02:04:30]  1st Amendment is speech.  2nd Amendment is guns.  2nd Amendment is guns.  Like the right to bear arms.  Yeah.  3rd Amendment is the right to paint a scrotum any color you wish.  Oddly, it is.  He's just willy-nilly throwing in amendments.  The 4th is the right to rape, which people are totally, totally neglected.  You know, well, people are interpreting it different now, thinking the forefathers weren't  into that.  But they were.  Of course they were.  By the way, how funny it would be if Michael Vick decided to settle out of court for $58,000  trillion? 
[02:05:00]  Calling up the UPS.  How much does the package weigh?  8 billion tons.  Dude.  It's gold.  You gotta read some of this.  Michael Vick is a quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.  On April 20th, Mr. Vick stole two white mixed pit bull dogs from my residence in Holiday,  Florida, and used them for dog fighting throughout the Richmond area.  Mr. Vick damaged my RFID chips in my dog's collars, so I will not be able to track them.  These two dogs were used for fighting on April 23rd, 24th, and 26th.  On April 28th, Mr. Vick sold my dogs on eBay, on an eBay auction. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, this is great.  And used the proceeds to purchase missiles from the Iran government.  Oh, you had me until then.  Yeah, it was sounding like, okay, he kidnapped the dog.  This is all over the paper today, by the way.  It's amazing how you could just do this.  Who wants to read number two there?  Can I read it?  Oh, I lied to read it.  All right.  I was a good reader in church.  Michael Vick continued to harass me on May 4th, 2007, by stealing my identity from my coat. 
[02:06:00]  From my coat.  He left his identity in his coat?  His pea coat.  My identity was used to open new store account cards to PetSmart and Doggy Warehouse  to purchase food from Mr. Vick's illegal dogfighting operation.  Oh, my God.  How did he have time to rush for that many yards last night?  Well, why wasn't he working on these missiles?  Now, this is what I wanted to know. 
[02:06:30]  Where did the copyright violations come in?  Yeah.  Apparently, here's his number three.  Michael Vick violated my copyright laws by using my copyright name on his personal football outfit  and casual clothing without paying before use.  This conspiracy started January 10th, 2001 until the day this suit was written.  Mr. Vick uses my name to sell t-shirts. 
[02:07:00]  Jonathan Lee Rich's mugs.  Mr. Rich's hats.  All right.  Where did this come from?  I'm like, where does he think?  It's coming from, you know, a spaceship.  That's what this is coming from.  Can I just read what's at the very bottom of the whole thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Due to restrictions on typewriters, this suit was handwritten.  Restrictions on typewriters.  Yeah, the restrictions are there's no longer any typewriters out there.  My mommy won't let me use the typewriters. 
[02:07:30]  Typewriters.  Is he a convict?  Go with four.  I don't know.  He's a convict.  Four is the big get here.  Four is great.  On February 10th, 2007, Michael Vick pleaded allegiance to Al-Qaeda.  Plead his allegiance to Al-Qaeda, excuse me.  Michael Vick subjected me to microwave testing.  The old microwave testing.  Yeah, this guy was wearing a tinfoil hat for sure.  Michael Vick used drugs in school zones.  That's a biggie.  That's very illegal.  And Michael Vick is in the business of illegal steroids. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, everyone's pile on.  All these hot topics.  I'm not sure that he's the victim of that.  What would be better if this was all true?  All true.  Every word of it.  Every bit of Al-Qaeda.  If Michael Vick made a statement today conceding all of these points.  Look, I absolutely did all this.  Hey, I got to get your attention here.  Someone is telling us on the SFV back.  On the copyright thing, look at the beginning of the suit.  The first paragraph.  He has his name written with a copyright mark after it.  Yes, there is a little C.  His signature, too, at the bottom. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  Yes, he's copywritten his name.  All right, and then what's the last one here?  Plaintiff prays this court to give relief on these issues.  Yes.  And then plaintiff, go ahead.  Plaintiff prays this court will issue a temporary restraining order against Michael Vick  so he can no longer sell my copyrighted material.  Michael Vick can't steal any more of my animals' dogs, in parentheses, for dogfighting.  As opposed to a cockatoo that he would steal for dogfighting. 
[02:09:00]  This guy's a silly goose.  Michael Vick has to stop physically hurting my feelings and dashing my hopes.  He has dashed his hopes.  And then he signs his name with the copyright thing.  Respectfully submitted.  Yeah.  Douglas Niedermeyer.  Yeah.  Then he has the copyright after his signature.  Jonathan Lee Riches, copywritten.  Physically hurting my feelings.  And then it says...  It's true I have dashed the hopes of one Jonathan Lee Riches on several occasions, and I'm sorry 
[02:09:30]  for that.  I think that...  And then it does say Jonathan Lee Riches, copywritten.  And then if you notice, number 40948-018, FCI, Federal Correctional Institution in Williamsburg.  So yes, he is in prison.  I gotta say, I don't think that this lawsuit is really well-grounded.  I think it's probably...  You know what, though?  He was able to file it.  It's filed and has to somehow be dealt with by the court. 
[02:10:00]  Whether it's just a two-second reading...  To write, if I did it, of all these charges.  Like a book of...  If I did it.  Now, I would have microwave-tested by putting the sensors in his attic where he would never  see them.  If I did it.  If I did it.  We got our music.  We got to...  I got a heart on it.  We got to step out.  Oh.  Hey, RobertKelleyLive.com.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got?  The Comedy Central Presents taping August 24th at 6 o'clock.

I've not seen it yet.  A lot of people calling every day.  They've seen it every morning, yeah.  And I apologize, but I am going to have to miss the second portion of the program. 
[02:11:00]  What?  I have to go pick up my gal.  What's going on?  Where is she?  She's going home.  Right away?  Yeah.  Well, it takes me an hour to get there.  But she's ready to go right now.  And then they check out.  That's pretty crazy.  Yeah.  Can I use your kazoo?  No.  Make sure the kazoo and all my things that my mouth goes on get sterilized and packed away  like they usually do.  How about just baby?  Oh, you keep that filthy dirty, Jim.  Love it that way.  It smells like mushrooms, Frank Link.  All right. 
[02:11:30]  We'll do.  We'll fool around a little bit next.  Fool around.  Maybe I'll call in.  How about you call in from your car?  That's always fun.  I'll call in from my car and you can listen to me drive home.  That's always good.  We'll do that next.  Give me the hotline number.  All right.  Guys, if you're not joining us, have a great day.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wowed.  We'd tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is spreading.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony maybe in a car soon.  It's Jim Norton.  It's Louis C.K.  And, of course, it's fat Bob Kelly who needed to go smoking between shows, and now we can't find him.  Fat, fat, smoky Bob Kelly.  Stupid Bob Kelly has to go smoke. 
[02:12:30]  Stupid, fat.  And possibly jerk off because we brought Tracy in, the new PD, and he lost his mind.  He turned into, what, a 15-year-old.  Yeah.  Oh, the girl with the shorts?  No, no, no.  She's an intern.  Oh, okay.  Tracy is the PD here in New York City.  Way to notice, Lou.  I know.  Wow.  You know the shorts with the legs?  Go all the way up to them.  Tracy's the new PD here, and she came in last week when Bob was in for Jimmy, and Bob lost his mind. 
[02:13:00]  And soon as she left, he goes, that's my type.  Oh, my God.  How are you?  That's my mind.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Bob.  I was just outside talking to Tracy.  See?  I told you.  What was she talking about?  The fact that you're going to come in, and we're going to do something, and it's just awful.  Well, actually, I told her my fantasy.  Did you really?  I was actually on the money with probably four to five.  Really?  What?  Do you get to kiss her toes?  No, that she doesn't want me to speak at all, and she wants me out before the birds chirp.  She said that to you?  No, I said that to her. 
[02:13:30]  My fantasy is almost like I come over late.  Yeah.  I get the call.  Yeah.  Just come over.  I go, okay.  I show up.  There's like a silk robe, panties, high heels.  For you to wear.  Laid out.  She's standing there smoking a long cigarette saying, put them on, faggot.  She has a strap-on cock.  Apparently, we're on XM, and apparently, you knew my fantasy.  Yeah, and then we come in, and there's candles lit, and- 
[02:14:00]  Why are you whispering?  Just talk.  Yeah, I'm not sure this is really exciting.  No, no.  He's really worked up.  All right.  The one thing I want to start by saying, when she came in, and you had a little interaction  with her, you lost your mind.  You couldn't look at her.  You were stammering.  You were like-  Yeah.  You didn't know what to do with your hands.  You were trying to make believe you were eating food, but there was really no food around.  I knew what to do with my hands.  Trust me.  Yeah, she's-  You haven't-  There's just that type of woman.  That type of girl that does it for me.  Oh, my God.  What does it? 
[02:14:30]  The big natural boobs she's got?  Just that she's a woman.  I love women.  You love women.  All right, well.  The women, and I like the little freckles up here from-  Too much sun?  Yeah.  I like the little freckles, the chest freckles.  Yeah.  And, oh, sure.  Her outfits are driving me nuts, and that long hair, and the beautiful lips, and those eyes,  and that little attitude she has.  She's probably very good as a lover.  Well, you couldn't look her in her eyes, though.  No, I can't.  You tried. 
[02:15:00]  I made you.  I made you very uncomfortable.  I'm like, look in her eyes.  And you were able to do it for like a second or two, and then you had to look down again.  Yeah, I got to look down.  Plus, she's a very powerful woman in here.  She comes in with a presence.  You know what?  Is she going to spank you?  What?  Actually, I think that if I was with her, no, I wouldn't want- I don't like to get spanked.  I actually spanked myself once by accident.  Yeah, but you would take a spanking from her.  I would take a spanking.  Yeah.  I'd take a spanking from you.  But even if it's not your fantasy, if she said, I want to spank you and shit on your bald head and rub it in, you'd do it, right? 
[02:15:30]  If she said nothing, either I don't touch you or I just shit on your head and laugh at you, you'll be like, well, I get to see your ass.  Is this your fantasy or is this her fantasy?  Yeah, my fantasy is her doing that to you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And Bob, what is she wearing?  She's wearing just a silk robe.  The silk robe, the panties.  With no- nothing on top, but her breasts aren't showing.  They're covered.  You understand?  Almost like-  Taboo, like Kate Parker and Taboo. 
[02:16:00]  Exactly.  And a little panties, because I don't want to see everything right away.  No.  But then she cuts a hole in the panties and shits out of it onto your head and then molds the shit into, like, a hairdo for you.  Into a shit hat.  So that you look like you got a shit hair.  A shit hat.  You're wearing a shit hairdo.  We're looking at shit hat videos.  How do we-  What is a shit hat?  Don't even get us there again.  Oh, she shits so much she molds it into a beehive.  That's right.  Like a fucking- a net footage shallow.  Yeah, he looks like he's in hairspray.  I just want to- 
[02:16:30]  I don't-  We saw a shit hat video.  There was so much shit on this chick's head that she couldn't keep her head up straight.  It was, like, tilted to the side.  But has anybody ever shit on somebody's head and then- like, a bald guy like him that's clean, bald, and then fashioned it nicely so it looks like a doll with plastic hair like Bob the Builder?  I would love to have that guy.  Like Bob the Builder.  Yeah.  I just shit right on my head.  Yeah.  Actually get, like, a comb and kind of make comb lines through it.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  That's what I mean.  Nice comb lines like Play-Doh hair.  You talked to her about this outside the studio?  Well, I kind of just told her. 
[02:17:00]  I asked her if she wanted hair, and she said, I'll go.  And she said, you know, she put a couple rules down.  There's no, you know, no intercourse.  Which I-  His voice is shaking.  He's really dispected by this.  Wait, which I'm into.  Wait, why no intercourse?  I don't want intercourse at all.  I don't want to-  One of our first meetings with her, she told Ant and I, I haven't been late in 12 years.  12 years?  Maybe she didn't want people to know that.  12 years?  Come on.  Was it 12 years?  Don't tell two radio hosts.  Months, maybe.  Wait, no. 
[02:17:30]  What did she tell?  It's not 12 months.  It's not 12 months.  You can't be that hot and-  Wait, how long?  12 months.  Why is she measuring her not laid, like the way people talk about their babies?  12 months.  I'm in my second trimester of not getting a kink in my pussy.  She hasn't been with a white guy in 12 years.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Wait, she's got to come in here now, because now I'm not sure.  No wonder Bob doesn't want to.  You can't follow that.  12 years of black.  Dude, I can't follow you.  It's true.  I got a rod right now.  Oh, you do.  Say Alice.  He's got a big piece. 
[02:18:00]  All right, let's-  Let's talk about-  So, do you think she shades or no?  What?  I think she shaves everything.  Why are you whispering now?  Yeah, why is everybody-  Why are you going to whisper?  I hope not.  I don't like a-  I do not-  I hate a shaved pussy.  I want a little patch.  I hate it.  I fucking hate it.  I want it to be fucking bald.  I want it to look like a profile of Alfred Hitchcock's face.  Just that fucking meaty fucking- 
[02:18:30]  So, basically, what you're saying is you want a cock with no hair.  No, I don't-  All right, Bob.  Yes.  So, what else was-  What are some of the other rules?  No intercourse.  No intercourse.  And I have to leave.  I can't stay.  So, what are you going to get done with her?  I'm going to get done a lot.  I, you know, use some toys.  Did you explain that part?  Use some toys.  All right, you'll use-  Actually, put one in my mouth.  You clear?  Oh, God.  What's wrong with this guy?  Do you want to be a cuckold for her?  Like, what's a cuckold?  It's just so weird that a beautiful woman inspires you to put on an egg lache and fuck your own mouth with a dildo. 
[02:19:00]  Look at her tits.  I want to fuck my own face with a rubber cock.  Louie has a gift.  How nice her tits are.  What are you-  You're probably-  You're probably good at Sudoku, too, huh?  Just putting the pieces together?  I don't know what that is.  You want the dildo in your mouth and then you're going to work her over that way?  No, it was actually a joke.  I wouldn't put the dildo in my mouth and work her over.  I'd just suck it.  Wait, would you be a cuckold for her?  Like, what the hell is a cuckold?  I'm explaining to you. 
[02:19:30]  Okay, sorry.  I didn't mean to jump in your throat.  It's a guy who likes to be humiliated.  Like, if she's with black guys.  She likes black guys.  No.  He likes to be able to watch and be taunted.  I've been watching videos like that.  I've never been into interracial porn.  But, boy, am I into it lately.  You mean, so a woman is with a black guy and then there's another white guy there going,  look at you.  Look at you with that black guy.  No.  Is that what it is?  Her father's just holding his chest like that.  No.  The guy watching has a relationship with the girl that's getting banged.  Right.  She's being fucked by a big cock and she's taunting the guy a little bit.  And some girls are corny. 
[02:20:00]  Who's taunting?  She's taunting.  The woman is taunting the white guy.  Oh, Sam, look at how this-  Even if she's fucking another white guy.  It's not the racial thing.  It's just the idea that she's being such a slut and humiliating the guys.  But this one girl is so good.  I forget her name, but she's always like, you like that?  You like watching me, little bitch?  You like watching me, bitch?  And she's fucking taunting this guy.  It's so-  And she's sucking this giant dick and taunting the guy she's with.  It's really fucking-  Just when I think you can't go any further, Norton, you find something out.  You actually have to go backwards now. 
[02:20:30]  Are they all actors?  I don't-  See, that would take me out of it.  I would need to know that there's some kind of realism to this thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They have to prove that they're actually a couple, and then I would maybe get into that.  Especially if the sexual thing is psychological.  You watch them, you see that they're really people.  They're not really actors.  Some of them are porn actors, but the majority of them are not.  They're average looking people.  Yeah, because anytime you watch a porn and they're doing that thing, especially porn now,  at least back in the day, they would actually act out the scene as best as they could.  And now they'll do the scene half-ass, and then she'll laugh, and she'll say something 
[02:21:00]  funny, because she just improv-ed the line.  Yeah, they giggle the whole time, because they're about to fuck.  Yeah.  There's no real-  Yeah.  All right, we're trying to get Tracy in studio for you.  Did you ever see porn bloopers, by the way?  We were talking about porn bloopers about two weeks ago.  There's such a funny one.  They do a scene, and it's actually well-acted.  This girl was blowing this guy.  Two girls sucking cock.  One girl had the cock in her hand, and then just out of no, it just takes this huge cock and  just slaps the other chick in the face with it.  It's fucking hilarious.  I would love to see porn bloopers. 
[02:21:30]  I've never seen them.  It's on YouPorn.  Type in porn bloopers.  This chick just sucking a cock.  She goes, crack, and the other goes, ooh.  My friend, she does porn, and I forget what-  Oh, is he on the other phone?  Yeah, we've been trying to get to him for five minutes.  Sorry.  Anthony.  I was just listening to the conversation, and when those movies are real and not movies,  it's called a home invasion.  There you go.  I don't like Anthony.  Already missed.  The seat being empty. 
[02:22:00]  That's weird.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ant, we're doing a little ... Everyone's moving up a chair here.  Jimmy, why don't you move over to Anthony's?  All right.  Louie, why don't you move over to Jimmy's spot?  And Bob, why don't you go to the couch?  I'm going to have to ...  Go to the couch, Bobby.  All right.  Nice talking to you.  If I had Anthony's button, I'd push it right now.  Someone's fucking up the program already.  Someone's fucking up the program.  Look at this idiot.  No, no, no.  You fucked up.  I get to go. 
[02:22:30]  Asshole.  I fucking hate New York this time driving.  Why?  Speaking of ...  This is not acting.  This is Anthony every day of his life driving home.  Anthony, where are you?  This fucking guy.  I'm on Van Damme.  Right.  And this dumb fucker was trying to make a left turn, so he blocks the entire lane that  I'm in by trying to make a left turn.  Nobody likes a tattletale, except of course me.  Oh, my God.  No.  Can you get next to him and get him to talk on the air? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, he already hit the turn.  I'll get people to yell, believe me.  I get people yelling at me all the time.  The savage fucking drivers that drive these black cars.  Right.  Taxi and limousine service.  Not the yellow cabs, but the black car drivers.  Yeah.  They are, of course, the town cars.  Horrid drivers.  When they get shot and they are found slumped over a wheel, I laugh.  Because I cannot stand them.  They are way worse than cabs.  Fucking paperwork. 
[02:23:30]  They're filling out paperwork.  And the light's green.  It's an arrow.  There's a gap of five cars in front of them.  And I miss the light because this guy is fucking filling out.  I had to go to blah, blah, blah, blah.  They're whining.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jimmy's working your buns.  I don't want to shut the audience right now if Jimmy has that sound effect machine. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, it's going to be a long, long hour and a half.  But that, uh...  Well, dude, are you still in the actual intersection?  No, I got past that.  Dude, I don't sit and fucking...  I don't sit there like...  You lack discipline.  I'm just sitting there.  I'm sidewalking it.  I do whatever it takes to get around fucking assholes.  I am above the law.  I don't pay attention to lights. 
[02:24:30]  I don't pay attention to speed limits.  Yep.  Hey, why is your phone grabbing out?  No, it's weird.  Like, Anthony was just here 20 minutes ago in a very happy mood considering that, you  know, his chick went through some minor surgery.  Now he's in his car and this is like...  Your whole mood has changed, sir.  Outside of the Holland Tunnel, miserable.  Yeah.  This fucking...  These New York and Jersey cocksuckers that have no concept that there are other people  on the road that want to get somewhere. 
[02:25:00]  Well, you know it's them.  You know it's them.  You are never to blame.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  That's terrible.  Like, no fads anywhere to be.  They're just out here to fuck with me.  Why don't they drive fast?  How come if they...  Do they ever look at the flashing walk-don't-walk sign and realize that light's going to turn  fucking red in a minute or in a couple of seconds?  Why don't I get through so that the guy behind me maybe could get through, too?  No, but they leave 18 car lengths in front of them. 
[02:25:30]  And the second it turns yellow, they hit the gas, and they get through, and I get stuck.  Why don't they...  Silence, whippersnapper.  What?  Go ahead, Ant.  Hit the gas earlier, and we can all get through.  But these...  What?  What?  Oh.  Got a boring...  I hit the wrong button.  No, I meant to hit...  How do I switch banks on this fucking thing?  No one's helping me.  I was trying to hit...  What?  I was trying to hit what?  What?  That was it.  Very complicated. 
[02:26:00]  What?  Oh.  Sorry.  Now, here we go.  We get on the expressway, and of course, on this on-ramp that's as long as a runway,  you have to do 20 miles an hour, because...  Arrgh!  It's the highway.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  You know, this is like...  This is like your traffic report, and it's an irritated fucking guy who hates people.  Let's see what's going on on the roads.  These motherfuckers!  Louie, we used to tape ourselves coming to work.  Oh, it was a lot of fun. 
[02:26:30]  Dude, you want to beep your horn?  I like this.  Then they'll move.  Anthony.  You fucking...  You fucking...  Jersey cunt.  This guy looks at me.  He thinks he's going to be all set.  He wanted to cut in front of me.  I didn't let him.  And now he's looking at me like I'm a fucking douchebag.  You fucking...  Oh, if I could use racial emphasis.  Lean out the window and go...  Good evening.  Now he's nowhere to be... 
[02:27:00]  Come on.  Come on, douchebag.  Dude, you gotta relax.  You have a heart attack.  Just relax, man.  Just tell the guy just to relax and...  Try the wine.  Have a drink together.  I'm in the...  I'm in the white painted like part where you're not supposed to be.  There we go.  Nope.  Stay there.  There we go.  I don't like people that can come up on their ass and right when you decide to go around  them, they decide it's time to get out of the way.  Well, that scared me.  I heard a siren. 
[02:27:30]  I thought I was being pulled over.  So the other guy's bothering you, right?  He stinks and I don't like it.  We lost you.  What?  We lost you for a second.  Oh, I'm still here.  I said I'm never around the problem long.  I yell and then I'm 80 miles an hour past them.  You just, you just, after someone fucks over, you just kind of go, go ahead, go on, leave.  Leave, I pardon you. 
[02:28:00]  I bet you that they're fucking, you know what it is, dude?  They're driving expensive cars.  God damn rich country.  So childish.  Those fucking rules.  Is there a lot of cars out there, Ant?  What do we got going on?  Uh, yeah, it's packed.  Uh, watch yourselves in.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  Uh, but, uh, I seem to be moving along at a pretty good pace right now. 
[02:28:30]  They seem a little more relaxed.  You're on your way.  Are you in the tunnel yet?  Expressway.  Uh, I'm okay.  Except for these cabs that are in the left lane for no reason.  Doing, let's see, 50 miles an hour.  We're on the expressway.  70 at least.  And they get this attitude like, I'm going fast enough.  No, you're not.  Look how close I am to you. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, no, if there's somebody behind you that's close to your bumper, you're not going fast enough.  Yeah.  Oh, could you get out of the way?  Holy Jesus fuck.  Get out of the way.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck you, hunk.  Hunk nigger.  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[02:29:30]  Dude, you know what?  You got to relax, dude.  You're in traffic.  You just, you know.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  That's the place to be.  And I'm not in traffic.  I'm in like cars that don't know to get the fuck out of the left lane.  You dick.  Shut up.  I, I, this cab has got to move.  You dick.  I love this button.  I don't have to say anything.  You know what I'm afraid of?  Jimmy is not going to want to give that up. 
[02:30:00]  I don't already.  Yeah.  It sucks.  It sucks.  I fucking love this machine.  And he was calling the guy in your way a dick, by the way.  Yeah, not you.  Not you.  We'll give him, we'll give him a machine with one button that works.  Just one.  One lousy button we'll give him.  Why not just call?  I, I actually want my own machine.  I think I can really contribute.  No.  I know how to do this.  Thank God.  No.  Hey, uh, Jimmy, um, Jimmy's like kind of sitting at your seat, eh? 
[02:30:30]  He's also fiddling with your, your whistles and stuff.  No, don't fiddling.  I swear.  I'm going to just have to call them and then I won't use them until I get to the last.  Dude, I'm not doing.  Oh, wait.  What do you need?  Just make sure the girl doesn't come in.  Oh, all right.  Uh-oh.  Your bell is going to get rung by his little, little Willie bell ringer.  Oh, he's ringing the bell with his penis, Anthony. 
[02:31:00]  He's ringing the bell with his mushroom head.  I couldn't, I couldn't stop him.  His big mushroom head was pounding down on your bell.  He just checked into the hotel with his cock.  Oh, no.  He just paged the bell boy with his panacea.  Anthony.  Use it with a fart.  Huh?  No, I didn't fart.  Oh, dude, you've got to make the whistle blow by using a fart.  No, I'm not.  I don't have to fart.  Well, us. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, let it be known that.  Hold on.  Let it be known that Steve just handed Jimmy the whistle.  Oh.  The whistle is in his ass.  The whistle's in his ass, Anthony.  I try to stop him.  He's going to make a whistle.  Make a whistle.  He's going to try to make a whistle.  Let's go.  It's roller skating time, everybody.  I don't have to.  I'm not going to make a whistle.  Make a whistle.  Why not?  Well, we're taking pictures of Anthony's whistle  and Jimmy's butt crack.  Oh, God.  Dude, you can reuse this.  Oh, you can hear the little balls.  He just dropped it out of his ass without using his hands. 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  Oh, it's now on the couch.  Can you fart hard enough to ring that bell, I wonder?  No, I can't.  I don't have to cut a gasser at all, actually.  No?  Can you shit and let it drop on top of the bell?  Oh, what's that?  What's that, Ant?  Does he have a gasser that can blow the whistle?  No, I was going to try that, but I didn't.  So, for myself.  What if you use the horn with the bubble in there  and blow air into your asshole with that horn?  And see if your eyes bulge out. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And see if it farts back out again.  Our anus.  No, I don't want to mess with that, because that's expensive.  What is?  I don't want to fuck with this bullhorn.  Oh, yeah.  Don't mess with the bullhorn.  Just the bell.  Yeah.  Just the bell.  Believe me, I will send out a lowly intern and make him get me new everything.  We already knew that, but we figured it would be fun for five minutes for the show.  Wait, what is he doing now?  He's putting his balls inside of the bell of that horn. 
[02:33:00]  He's blowing the horn onto his balls.  He's got his two peaches stuffed in your horn.  Stuffed in, like a couple of hairy melons in a tuba.  That was almost like a cartoon.  Oh, my God.  That's how bugs would stop the guy from beeping the horn.  There you go.  All right.  Well, you might want to throw that on the couch, though.  I freed it up.  What?  Yeah.  Throw it all away. 
[02:33:30]  It gets thrown away.  Well, you can reuse.  You should reuse that whistle, though.  That would be a fucking great moment.  You can sell that on eBay, that horn.  It's had your balls in it.  When I put it in my mouth and say how familiar it tastes.  All right, Ann.  How's the ride?  Good?  Yeah, we're doing good.  I can just sit here and, you know, you guys do a show.  I'll chime in.  All right.  Hold.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we bring Tracy in here?  All right.  And Bob, in between shows, talked to Tracy about his little fantasy. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Obviously, Bob's got the girlfriend and stuff, but this is like that window shot.  You're just kind of taking a peek and speaking your mind a little bit.  No, it's not like, you know.  But it's funny because we didn't do this on the radio, but in between shows, Tracy did  come in and Bob did lose his shit.  Yeah.  He really lost his mind.  Huh?  Was it like Sam, Bob's zombie?  Close.  Yeah.  I hope he described the Sam thing for everybody.  He looked kind of like a newborn fawn. 
[02:34:30]  He couldn't stand up without holding on to anything.  Little rickety legs.  He was shaking so bad, his knees were just wobbling.  Knees bending outwardly.  Yeah.  His mother's licking afterbirth off his face.  Shaky, kind of nervous thing.  That's what he looked like.  Right.  Oh, by the way, Anthony, good news.  We got a sweeper.  Anthony's fucking traffic report.  It just came in from Tim.  Let's take a listen to this here.  Uh, it's Anthony's fucking traffic report on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:35:00]  There you go.  All right.  Hey, Tracy, why don't you sit on the couch there?  Tracy, our fine PD here in New York City for 92.3 KROQ.  You're on the XM show, so you get cursing stuff.  Well, that's good because I really can't control my language.  So they, Bobby said that he had discussed, um, his thing with you.  Oh, it's more of my fantasy.  His fantasy.  He said that he was sharing some of his fantasies with you.  And what exactly was it?  What did he say? 
[02:35:30]  You better get your head and your ass wired together or I will take a giant shit on you.  No, that's not exactly what he said.  No, that's, that's way off.  Hey, Bob, will you look at her, please?  I'm trying to.  Bob was nervous.  He said, uh.  Are you about a size 14?  But it was very, it was very generous, I think, that you let him share it with you.  In front of a whole bunch of people, too.  That all.  Wait, how did it go about?  He walked up to you and just said, this is my fantasy?  No, no, no, no.  What did you exactly say?  I can't be on the mouth. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  She, she, I was outside smoking and she actually turned the corner and, uh.  She turned the corner?  Yeah, she turned the corner.  Why, why, why?  Yeah, he sees it so dramatic.  Was her hair blown in the wind?  Yeah, actually, there was a little breeze, which is weird because there's no breeze out  there today.  And, uh, she turned the corner and she said, uh, she goes, she goes, you got a light stud?  Then she started singing the song, you better wake up or something like that.  Like grease, I think.  But, no, then she, uh, she turned the corner and I just, I, I, you know, I said, uh, I have 
[02:36:30]  a fantasy.  Can I tell you?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  Don't let me turn my ass, dude.  I was close, uh, close, not right to that point right away.  I mean, I kind of, you know, um, I said, uh, she said, yeah, go ahead with kind of an  attitude, which actually made me more turned on.  Like, you know, if you say the wrong thing, I might punch you in the face, which I liked. 
[02:37:00]  Um, look at her, not me.  I can't, because Norton's, does she say anything or lack thereof is in the way.  Did she say anything to you?  This is a giant cock.  No, she didn't say that.  Trust me.  You've seen my cock.  He told me it was the size of a thumb, which kind of just ruined the whole thing at that  moment.  So.  Oh.  Yeah, well, no, I mean, it's, it's a fist and a thumb, maybe.  Hey, you told us, uh, it's been a while since you had sex and I, I might have blew up your  spot by saying it's been 12 years and I, I guess that's wrong. 
[02:37:30]  12 years.  12 years.  20 months.  20 months.  All right.  20 months.  12 years is way too long.  Why 20 months?  Because I'm picky.  Okay.  Because you're what?  I'm picky.  Oh, picky.  It's the voice too.  You hear the voice?  Yeah.  You like the voice, Bob?  Oh, she smokes like a pack a day.  So when you were telling her all your fantasies, what are you doing with the blueberry that's  stuck in between your teeth all morning?  Do I have one?  Yes.  Can I just say something though?  It's not like that's going to detract from my face and my tits. 
[02:38:00]  You got a big ass blueberry skin on it in the middle of his teeth.  That's actually going to help me.  It's going to actually detract.  It's going to make her focus on that dumb tooth rather than my tits and my stomach.  Oh, come on.  You look good, Bobby.  Relax.  You're a swell looking fellow.  Hey, Bobby.  What size are your tits is what I want to know.  I actually have.  Oh.  No, it's all right.  I like that.  It's nice.  We can play around.  We can, you know, have fun.  But, um, I have, uh, one, there's no need to get mean, but geez, well, that's what she 
[02:38:30]  was getting at.  I was trying to protect you, but you said no problem here.  So there you go.  I was talking about your man boobs with Tracy.  Oh, you don't have to fucking turn on me either.  I'm probably, and I'll go in with you.  Bob and I probably have legitimate bra sizes.  We just don't know what they are, but I'm sure that, I don't know.  I'm probably a 34 B or something.  I'm probably a 36 B.  Yeah.  I mean, once a month, let's see.  Uh, what at?  Did we have some?  Anthony, we couldn't hear you, bro.  Anthony.  Yeah, this is going just like the, uh, fantasy that, uh, Bobby was spelling out before, uh, 
[02:39:00]  the break.  Uh, just like it.  Talking about your man tits with the girl instead of all that, uh, that sexy shit you  were talking about earlier.  Yes.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, the keyword would be fantasy.  So, Bob, why do you like, uh, Tracy?  Tell her to her face.  It's, it's, she has, you know what she has?  Stand up, Tracy.  And, and, she has this, remember back, like, um, who was the chick that was in Superman?  Oh, Margo Kidder.  Margo Kidder.  You remember how hot she was? 
[02:39:30]  You mean Margo Kidder was a dog?  No, I'm going to tell you.  She took her teeth out and one.  A dog.  What is wrong with you?  Let's, uh, let's, let's.  Tracy, I apologize for our friend.  Let's, let's, let me finish.  Margo Kidder was a kook.  Hang on.  Yeah, she's a kook now.  She took her front teeth out and hung out in people's backyards.  Yeah, now.  Shit in the pools?  No, no, there's that look of that woman when they had, it was, it was like, uh, the, the  natural hair and long and it's, it's, it's, she's just all natural, but she's a woman. 
[02:40:00]  There's something just, she's, she's just gorgeous.  You know what I mean?  And it's laughing at you.  She's all natural and she's a woman.  What are you, like all natural men usually?  I'm kind of nervous.  Yeah, obviously.  She's actually standing in the pose that I had in my fantasy when she opened the door.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like that.  All she's missing is the robe.  Yeah.  No, she's, uh, completely sexy.  You're right.  Yeah, there's something about her, man.  That's just, it's, look at her.  Well, because also she's, uh, I mean, I don't know, we gotta be, I don't want to. 
[02:40:30]  I guess you're nervous too.  No, I just don't want to, because some women don't like to hear it, but because she's older,  she's, she, you're not 21.  Right.  So she owns the sexuality.  She just goes, you can tell that when she put these clothes on, she said, these are  going to make my tits look nice and these shoes make my legs very fuckable.  So I put them on.  Way to phrase it, Lou.  But she owns it because, uh, it's her power and she's not, uh.  That's what Bobby says in the morning.  What?  Bobby says that when he puts his shoes on, they're going to make my legs look fuckable. 
[02:41:00]  Oh.  I don't look at Tracy like that.  We work together, it's a professional relationship and I respect what she does as the program  director.  Okay, I think I'm being a really good sport here.  Yes, you are.  I don't, I just want to, I don't want to do that.  I just want you to open the door in that outfit and, you know.  Tracy, not to change subjects, but did you have a problem with Miss Jones?  Did I have a problem with her?  Yeah.  Not at all.  Well, with, do you know, uh, black voices at AOL.com? 
[02:41:30]  Tracy, last name, former, uh, big wig who ran Hot 97 is portrayed as a low down lying,  celebrity seeking bitch who often criticized Miss Jones' show without offering any tools.  What is that?  And?  Is there something there?  No, she's trying to sell books.  Who's that?  Miss Jones.  Oh, you're in her book?  Yeah.  And what does she say about you?  Basically what you just said.  What? 
[02:42:00]  Who's Miss Jones?  Oh, we're going to get into that on the other side.  She's, uh, she's a radio host here.  Oh, you just gave us a nice little, little thing to talk about on the other side.  Who threw Todd Lynn to the fucking, what is she?  The tsunami.  Fast, yes.  Oh, we'll get into that.  Tsunami song.  That was that chick.  You got, you got something.  Listen, I've been trashed in so many books and on so many radio shows at this point,  it doesn't even matter.  Yeah, but you got some pit bulls now.  Trust me.  We're going to have some fun with that.  So I got some backup?  Sure.  You got some pit bulls.  Are you going to have a lot of fun with what I just read in the coming weeks?  Well, Miss Jones, Miss Jones. 
[02:42:30]  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it.  There you go.  Exactly.  For the record, I didn't say that.  No, no, no.  All right, so let's wrap up this fantasy thing.  What else there, Bob?  You like the boobies?  What else?  The hair?  Well, you got, it's exactly what it is.  Oh, he likes your freckly boobs, too, he said.  Oh, just the chest.  I like those little freckles.  Like, because you've been in the sun, you know, you like, you lay it in your backyard or on  your roof or something like that?  Topless on Reese Park.  Are you kidding me?  No.  I might. 
[02:43:00]  Wait, you go topless in a what?  On Reese Park.  Where is that?  It's right between Brooklyn and Queens.  Where?  Can you give me a Kingsley and Google it?  You're on directions?  Wait, is it?  And I want dates.  Hold on, hold on.  Is it a nude beach?  No.  Anywhere in New York, it's legal.  Do you see the kids kind of hanging around you?  There's other topless women.  Does it bother you that there's vans of old men with popcorn just staring at you?  No.  No?  It turns around.  So if a guy stares at you while you're out naked with topless, I should say, and a guy,  you know dudes are looking at you, you have no problem with that. 
[02:43:30]  I'm kind of oblivious to it.  I'm just like in my own world, not paying attention.  Does it?  Honestly, please answer me.  Is there any part of you that was like...  Wait, you're oblivious to people looking at you as you're topless?  Why is that such a lie?  I'm serious.  I'm sitting there reading or listening to the station.  I'm not paying attention.  You know guys are looking at you if you're topless.  Yeah, but she's a strong and self-possessed woman, so they don't have any power over her  with their looks.  Like, it's one thing.  If a guy can look at a woman's tits and make her feel differently, that's him having power  over her.  But she is perfect.  She's a strong person who doesn't care. 
[02:44:00]  It's like somebody looking at your face.  Like, I don't care if you're looking at my face.  I don't give a shit.  She's got perfect.  Her tits, she knows they're great.  She puts them in the sun.  Perfect.  She enjoys the feeling of the warm sun on her tits.  They're perfect.  That guy can go fuck himself.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  Fuck him, too.  That guy's me, but fuck him.  Bob wants...  Bob is turned on by that indifference, also.  Hold on.  We got info on this park.  Iraq, you know something about this park?  That she...  The sunbathes topless in?  Yeah.  It is actually kind of common where it is.  It's over in the Rockaways. 
[02:44:30]  Thank you.  Wait, it's a common thing for the girls to be topless in?  Yes.  Yeah.  So it is a common thing.  I've heard that.  Can guys take out their stamenkies?  No.  What?  And that's all you got, Iraq?  And are there pervs just kind of hanging around there because they can see topless women?  It depends on the time of year because sometimes there's a lot of families around that area,  but for the most part there is a lot of older gentlemen just perusing the beach with their metal detectors. 
[02:45:00]  That's true.  But they're there the night before dropping a shitload of nickels.  Yeah.  Ooh, I found a nipple ring.  A lot of nipple rings on that beach.  I imagine.  You don't have any piercings, right?  I do.  You do?  Can I guess where?  You can guess.  I don't think I'll be able to tell you, but you can guess.  She doesn't wear a bra, so obviously no nipple rings.  I would say ears and belly button.  Nah, she goes a little crazier than that.  I would say clitoris.  Clitoral hood.  I would say above the labia. 
[02:45:30]  I would say just...  Are you expecting me to answer?  No, you can do whatever you want.  Okay.  I told you.  She goes belly button, obviously, right?  Ears and belly button.  You got a little belly button ring.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Oh, look at that stomach.  That's great.  Look at that stomach.  Are you out of your mind?  Look at Bob Lawson.  God, that makes me angry.  Why?  She's a lovely lady.  I want to bite a pencil.  That friggin' stomach is just insane.  She's just...  And she's a woman.  Yes.  Imagine showing up.  You know she'd have some cool music I never heard of on. 
[02:46:00]  Some tribal beast.  Yeah, some type of jazzy tribal thing she got when she visited Africa on a tour whenever  she was there and...  Oh, God bless.  And everything about you is natural.  Can I say that?  That or the last time she went to a Puff Daddy party.  Oh, Jesus.  Negative.  She likes the...  She likes the, you know...  What?  She likes the blacks?  She likes blacks.  Oh, you like black duds?  Yeah.  Well, I'm definitely...  We'll definitely not have sex then.  That's her fault.  We weren't having sex anyway, but...  It's not like the fact that she's doing black guys is what ruined it. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, but if you're...  Yeah, if she's doing black guys...  You are three black dicks away from fucking...  You could officially have sex with her and...  Three black dicks...  Three black dicks ago she would have...  What are you saying?  My dick is small, her vagina's huge.  I don't know what you're saying.  Is there a reason for that?  Or is there something you always like?  This is a giant cock.  Is there a reason for black guys?  Or are you just the guys you always like?  No, it was just that that was the social circle I moved in.  And that's who I met.  And this was a long time.  So when you...  Those are the people you deal with.  Those are the people you meet.  Those are the people you end up dating.  Right.  So what are you dealing with now? 
[02:47:00]  Nobody.  You have no social circle.  20 months she went.  20 months.  I have a rabbit.  A rabbit?  Prison?  Prison?  Yeah.  Is he still on the phone?  Yeah, he just said, is your social circle is basically prison?  What, do you work in a cafeteria?  I had a hairnet on.  So do you like white guys too?  Or is this just...  Yeah, I mean, sure.  She likes a rabbit right now.  That's convincing.  And we're talking about these...  I don't know why she isn't hooked up in 20 months.  What's the name of your vibrator there? 
[02:47:30]  The iVibe Rabbit and it's purple.  The i what?  iVibe.  Is that the rabbit?  The iVibe Rabbit.  Do you have any glass dildos?  No, I don't.  I swear to God, I thought she meant an animal.  No.  The rabbit is a very popular sex toy.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, there's many different versions.  I have.  You're doing it with that thing?  That looks scary.  What thing?  We got a copy of the iVibe Rabbit.  Look at this thing.  Blue.  That really looks like a cell phone.  It looks like a cell phone.  It looks like you called somebody on that fucking thing. 
[02:48:00]  She's fucking the original cell phone with the battery pack?  Yeah, how many minutes you get with that thing when you're not...  Jesus, you can make a smoothie.  Rubbing your clit off.  You can make a smoothie with that.  It gets caught on the piercing, though.  You could crush ice and make a little smoothie.  It looks like you bought it from a Mr. Softie truck.  She just gave you a little tip where the other piercing was, but you weren't listening.  I already knew where it was.  You're a bad listener.  I knew where it was.  I called it.  All right.  Well, wow.  What do you do with that thing?  I mean, that's crazy.  Do you fight gladiators with that? 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  Do you ever feel...  No one's getting great at those buttons.  Do you ever feel silly when you're using the iVibe Rabbit's vibrator?  Silly.  Why would I feel silly?  What, does it tell jokes?  Well, because it looks kind of...  It doesn't...  It looks kind of robotic.  See, that's how...  Yeah, hence its appeal.  But it has a big, like a square box of...  That shows how...  That's how unvisual women are.  It does.  She doesn't...  That's how little appeal a penis actually has.  It could be fucking purple with gray buttons on it.  Yeah.  And an LED display. 
[02:49:00]  It is purple.  And it's just as good as a cock.  It is purple.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Pantsy talk.  Pantsy talk for a four.  It could actually have Don Knotts' face on it.  Yeah.  It wouldn't matter.  She's like, fine.  As long as it didn't have yours, Bob.  It's not like a...  Wait, wait.  Go back to that picture.  It looks like a...  Why are we gonna...  Jesus.  It looks like you're gonna cut me out.  I mean...  It looks like a remote for your TV, too.  How many...  How many...  Can you change your channels with that thing in between sessions?  You can program it to change your cable and open your garage.  What's the hype?  It's a vibrator designed after the iMac computer. 
[02:49:30]  Hey, Lou, you like the iMac, right?  Yeah.  All right.  And comes in the same array of colors.  The iVibe Rabbit.  Oh, it's like the old...  It's like the old blueberry iMacs when they were like blueberry and raspberry colors.  Has advanced IC chip technology that allows you perfect control over your pleasure.  How it's supposed to be used.  Although it does make a pretty centerpiece, you kick back, send it in, turn it on, and  enjoy all its wild pleasures.  Send it in, UPS.  And the best parts for...  First and foremost, it's power. 
[02:50:00]  Power.  If wanted to, those rabbit ears can go all crazy on your clit.  Speaking of the rabbit, it has been attached to the shaft so it can flex back.  Now you can insert all seven inches.  You go for all seven?  I'm not answering this question.  All right.  All seven inches of the shaft.  Hope goes okay.  You want to keep going over there and there's two of them taped together?  I'm not really sure how...  On the end of a broomstick?  I'm not really sure how far I can tape this.  I was just trying to add funny to funny.  Don't take it that far because Tom will kill me.  Guilty Lily a little.  Yeah.  We can't. 
[02:50:30]  We can't.  Yeah.  We're not really sure how far we can take it because technically she's our boss.  Yeah.  Come on, Bob.  Actually, she would never give us a problem.  It would be Tom.  But Tom would give us some kind of joke.  Do you want to hear my fantasies about Tom?  Hold on.  Let me...  Yes.  I fantasize about his tie.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Seven inches of the shaft without worrying about whether or not the rabbit ears will lie up  against your clit.  A major improvement from the classic jackrabbit.  Do you agree?  That thing was such a pain in the ass, right?  You had to worry about how the ears...  You hated the jackrabbit?  You know what?  The batteries kept dying really quickly.  This one has more staying power.  It's a convenient all-in-one toy. 
[02:51:00]  There's no separate controller or battery compartment to keep track of.  It's all at the base of the vibrator.  Her neighbors think she's been doing renovation for ten years.  What is she doing in there?  Hey.  Hey, you gotta...  And they suggest you hold on to it Harry Carey style.  They're suggesting you use the vibrator Harry Carey style.  Harry Carey...  Oh, I see.  They have ones with remote controls, too.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, those glass dildos are great, though.  How far away do you get from your vagina that you need a remote control? 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Now we're taking...  Across the room?  A little bit too far.  What a remote control?  Jesus.  How many black guys have you been with?  You're talking about a remote control vibrator.  Can I take it off?  Am I supposed to ask you about the weather after that?  Any follow-up to that question is disgusting.  You know, Lou, you have to realize that you can't...  We can't...  She's our boss.  We can't talk to her.  I don't work here.  Fuck you.  I don't work here.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Sorry.  You're right.  All right.  Keep going.  Is there anything else on this page worth mentioning? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  At some point, I actually have to go and do some work.  Yeah.  She's uncomfortable.  She's a little...  Yeah.  She's going to go.  No, I'm being really good about this one.  Oh, you're fantastic.  And that's why I love you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Say, music's playing.  You're cool.  This is what K-Rock's playing.  Say, you're all right.  Oh, boy.  Green Day.  Haven't heard them in a while.  Ah.  Hey, when do you take...  Yeah.  Doesn't sound anything like their old stuff.  No, no, no.  Hey, a lot of work to do today.  All right.  Yes, all right. 
[02:52:30]  Date Rape, play 11.  When do you take over the music?  What do you mean?  Are they still programming out of Los Angeles?  No, no.  She's been doing it.  Okay.  Her big decision is what to follow up the Green Day record with.  Should I go with Red Hot Chili Peppers today, or should I do some Sublime?  I like the playlist.  They play Sublime too much.  No, I like the Sublime.  Too much, though.  It's good.  Oh, no, Sublime.  Too bad enough song.  I want to hear Eben.  I just want to hear Date Rape.  Sublime needs to be heard by many more people.  They never got their proper due.  Well, they have now that he overdosed. 
[02:53:00]  How many songs are you playing by Sublime?  We heard Date Rape this morning.  I think there's like five in the library.  That's not bad.  How many Aussie songs?  You know, I don't know.  Okay.  I would like an answer.  And by the way, that's not what I'm spending my days doing.  It's trying to find other air personalities.  So we have some other people in the air.  You're screaming at me.  Representative from California.  What happened?  Nothing.  He's pointing up.  No, I wasn't.  I was pointing to this because you whapped that.  Yeah, I know.  I whapped it anyway.  Bang. 
[02:53:30]  All right, Bob.  Are you done with her or what?  Yeah.  Well, first of all.  Are you done abusing me?  I haven't abused you.  I hope you know that.  How about a hug or something?  I haven't abused you at all.  I hope you know that.  How about a hug?  I've just explained.  And my fantasy wasn't like I was holding you down and pulling your hair and making you say...  Yeah, that would have been interesting at least.  Well...  Ooh.  Oh.  I was actually...  If you got what I was trying to say, I was actually saying that.  That's exactly what I wanted to do. 
[02:54:00]  But apparently you didn't get the joke.  I didn't.  Oh, we lost Anthony.  He must have made it to the hospital there.  But, yeah, I mean, she's just amazing.  She really is.  All right, what about a hug or something?  We've got to end this with something nice.  I don't...  She's going to make her touch.  Ooh, is that skeeving you out?  Yeah, don't make her touch him.  See, this is the thing.  See, this is where you suck, Opie.  No, I don't suck.  Hang on one second.  I'll tell you why.  Because she actually would actually give me a little flirt here and there.  The smallest amount that would actually do me for, like, the weeks that I probably  don't see her.  But now she's, like, treating me like that fucking hunk of shit. 
[02:54:30]  In other words, I played perfectly.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Good job.  Good job.  His job isn't to help you enjoy yourself.  Give a shit about your pleasures?  By shitting on your face.  She's treating me?  You fucking red-headed asshole.  Ooh.  Wait, wait, wait.  You rock.  Ah, Jane says. Nice choice. Very good.  We like Tracy very much.  Tracy, I'm going to admit something. 
[02:55:00]  I hate women in radio, and we've talked about it for many, many years.  And you got the big eyes, and you got shocked.  But I'm going to say something nice. We respect you, and we like working with you so far.  Thank you. I like working with you.  Because people have asked.  Because, like, dude, you guys had awful things to say about women in radio all these years.  I'm like, yeah, she's got a little edge to her, and she's doing good so far.  I'm not really like other women in radio.  No, well, duh.  She's not bad to look at, either.  That wasn't why I was hired, believe it or not. 
[02:55:30]  She's actually better than a poke in the eye.  You're saying she was hired for her tits?  What are you saying, Bob?  Why would they hire somebody for...  Because the fact that, like, at the virus shows, you have women walking around with no clothes on.  Nobody's even talking to them.  Right.  Like the strippers at the virus shows.  Yeah, I know.  Excuse me, I'm trying to get a glass of water.  Could you get your tits out of my way?  It's like, nobody cares?  I ignore those dumps in the virus shows.  Why give a key position to a woman for her tits when the tits are, like, laying around like dirty socks?  Right.  Exactly.  Jesus.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:56:00]  No, I agree with you.  Okay.  I knew she was the real deal, because the first time she came in here, Bobby, was a Wednesday,  and she was going to flash us for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Oh, God.  And she's our boss.  That's pretty good.  And Tom said, don't fucking do that.  Why would Tom do that?  Bob prevented her from flashing us.  You know what?  She suns her tits next to the BQE all day long.  Yeah.  How much does it really matter?  Let's Google Earth.  Everybody going to Queens.  When are you laying out?  From three to five.  Let's Google Earth and try to find you. 
[02:56:30]  How funny would that be?  How much is it going?  There you go.  Oh, that'd be funny if we just all showed up with vans of freaking pests, stared at you,  and you tried to eat.  Thank God this summer's almost over.  And she got us the stripper pole.  Nice.  So far, only guys have used it, which is a problem, but we'll work on that.  We have a penthouse chick coming in, I think.  Tomorrow.  Or today.  What happened?  Can she sit on top of it?  Maybe tomorrow.  Are you really going to have a girl in there?  Finally, yeah.  And she got the new wow stickers made, and she got the pasties made. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know why we need 10,000 pasties, but she got them made.  I didn't make 10,000.  Yeah.  I thought pasties on parade, you know, could be fun.  Sure.  Yeah.  You should have done a car crash.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  All right, how about a hug?  How about one little hug?  Just come over and give me a hug.  An innocent hug.  He's got a girlfriend.  Can I go?  Yeah.  Can I go, too, to the bathroom? 
[02:57:30]  All right.  A very, like a hip-hop hug, not a real one.  Easy with your...  All right.  What's a hip-hop hug?  Are you good-looking?  That's where you shake hands, and you put the shaking hand between the bodies.  All right.  You have to keep some contact.  I really do have a crush, but, you know, I mean, come on.  Look at you.  You're sweaty.  Let's not get carried away, Trace, okay?  You're sweaty.  All right, you got the blueberry out of your teeth, so this is good.  Did I really?  Yes.  All right.  I'm approaching you now, Bob.  Here she comes.  Bob's...  Now he's stuffing more blueberries in between his teeth. 
[02:58:00]  There they go.  Tracy.  Their bodies are going to touch.  Look, she's taking his hand.  She's showing him how.  Ew.  She doesn't want anything to do with you.  Oh, that was really sad.  Oh, Bob.  How bad was that?  Let's be honest.  She didn't want anything to do with you.  You're acting like this is the first time it's ever happened to me in my life.  You're like the elephant man with a burlap sack over your head.  I am not an animal.  There goes Tracy.  Bye, Tracy.  Take care, sweetie.  Goodbye.  Oh, now you're all...  Take care, Bob.  Take care.  Take care, sweetie.  Hey, baby doll.  Hey, doll face.  Good for you, huh? 
[02:58:30]  Hey, good.  Go get yourself something.  So how'd her appearance go?  She was very badly raped, you see?  I guess we lost Ann.  I think he's at a hospital right now, so...  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  I'm doing good with these buttons, I think.  You're terrific.  And if you knew the gasser, I just passed up.  Oh, God.  I didn't know it.  I didn't do it.  Well, no, in a second.  My lungs are processing your shit.  My lungs are taking particles of your shit and dispersing them into my bloodstream, into  my brain.  Atta boy.  You're welcome. 
[02:59:00]  Yep.  All right.  The station's running fine.  Hey, this was made for you, Jimmy.  On the next Opie and Anthony show, Opie and Anthony face their toughest challenge yet.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  Listen as one man describes an addiction.  Wherever there were cocks, there was me.  And how he went from one cock to many.  I was taking a hundred a night.  What do you think of them apples?  Then you'll hear a horrifying tale of a bukkake party gone wrong.  Blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka, blurka.  All over my fat, colorless stomach. 
[02:59:30]  You can't tell where the cum ends and my skin begins.  Blurka, blurka, blurka.  Plus, an ending you won't want to miss.  That's right.  I see a couple of men do some docking and settle this.  It all happens on the next Opie and Anthony show.  That's not bad, man.  Who did that, Dirk?  Dirk did that.  That's a good job right there.  That's pretty good stuff.  All right.  I would have watched that movie.  We got Louis C.K.  We got Bob Kelly.  I would have started.  We got Jimmy.  Nothing. 
[03:00:00]  I like you on the buttons.  You finally used it correctly.  I'm enjoying the buttons.  All right.  We'll regroup.  You look like a button.  Do I?  How about a little variety?  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia have announced.  We hate women and we butt sex at each other.  No, we shouldn't be doing that.  One of you guys can eat my ass right now.  It's fantastic.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[03:00:30]  Anthony, of course, went home early today, but he did a fine job from his car for a while.  Bob Kelly in studio.  He was picking his gal up from the hospital.  Yeah.  Jim Norton in studio.  Louis C.K. in studio.  And there was something I can't remember.  There was something with Bobby that I was thinking about in the bathroom.  Oh, your sick contest you want to do.  Well, the...  Why don't you explain?  Because I'm going to sound like an ass if I do it. 
[03:01:00]  What?  The baby wipe?  Yeah.  He wants to do a baby wipe contest.  What is that?  Well, that's where you get a thing of baby wipes and then you just randomly, everybody  picks one and you have to take one swipe of your ass and see who has the cleanest or  dirtier ass.  Why the fuck do you want to...  I actually like that.  How about let's go to a ball game and hang around or something?  I don't want to do it for an afternoon.  Louis, I don't want to do it for an afternoon.  I want to just take one swipe and see what happens.  What do you... 
[03:01:30]  What do you...  Oh, in that case, everything in moderation, Bob.  Sounds awesome.  And then...  You're acting like the show doesn't fucking do that every day.  I don't want to scrutinize a baby wipe that you just fucking rubbed on your asshole.  And then what happens?  Apparently, he's not confident in his asshole.  We just hurt.  But then what happens?  Do we just laugh at the person that has the messiest ass?  How does it play out in your mind?  No, actually, the person with the...  You could go two ways with it.  The person with the dirtiest ass could win.  But it wouldn't be us.  It would be like, you know, when you bring the guys in to play those... 
[03:02:00]  Like, what the hell is that?  Right, right.  You could have them do it.  Because, you know, we...  It'd have to be people that the listeners know really well.  And Jimmy can't be in the contest because he has to clean his ass, so...  I know where you're getting at.  What?  I know...  Don't!  What?  Go!  Oh, that's all right.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  All right, hang on.  The last time I'm going to ask you...  Where am I going with this, Bobby?  Huh?  You trying...  You want to play now?  I don't know.  Me and you?  Go head to head?  I...  I'll play right now.  My asshole fucking squeaked. 
[03:02:30]  You could eat lima beans.  I said that already.  Really?  I know.  Yeah, he's...  Jimmy's not gonna...  Jimmy's gonna come out clean.  I'll still do it.  Why all the time?  Because I'm a fucking clean guy.  I'm a hairless asshole.  Would you girls love to sniff and lick?  Bobby, why don't you start the contest off?  No, you're out of your mind.  Go get some fucking clean ass.  Why don't you start the contest?  You really need to work on it.  You know, you used to be so good at that.  Now you just like...  And then you start singing and you're giggling and you don't...  You kind of look away.  Bobby, you're really weird, dude.  He's figuring out my poker face.  I hate you for that.  Get some, Bob.  No, it's funny because he suggests it. 
[03:03:00]  He goes, how about if we rub baby wipes on our assholes and show them to each other?  But hey, don't make me do it.  Yeah.  Bobby, why don't you start the contest?  No, you're not gonna get...  All right, I'll do it.  Hey, if we all jerk off, it's fun.  If I just jerk off, it's weird.  I understand, Bobby.  Bob brings a good point.  I do.  I raise a good point.  Bobby, if you do it, I will do it.  You know, I have a tattoo.  Actually, a friend of mine said that too, and he never got one.  So go fuck yourself.  All right?  How's that sound?  Don't get pissed at me.  Don't use my needy and my fucking wanting to belong against me. 
[03:03:30]  But don't get pissed at me.  You suggested this.  I didn't suggest it for us.  I suggested it, you know, you could do it.  No, no, no.  The first time you told me it was for us.  Yes, this all began with you saying, we all...  I'm sitting here watching it come out of your face, those words.  We all put baby wipes on our assholes.  And then you started to feel weird, and you changed it to the people that come in.  Actually, Opie, the original plan was for other people, but Opie used his mind skills. 
[03:04:00]  No, you said it, though.  Yeah, because I didn't want to say it, though.  Oh, good.  Guys, let's do some asshole wiping.  All right.  Bobby, start the contest.  I'm not doing that.  And everyone's...  Why are you doing it?  What?  Why?  I don't need a reason not to wipe my asshole and show you what was on it.  Yes, you do.  All the guys are doing it, Luke.  Yeah, well.  Let's go to...  Hold on.  Jake and Buffalo.  Go, Jake.  Try to get in here.  Yeah, we can place bets on whose ass is the 30th or the cleanest.  Well, they're already betting on pal talk and some feedback. 
[03:04:30]  See, Bobby, you might be on to something.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Opie, you in?  Yeah, if you do it on it.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  You got to...  No, we all have to view it.  You can't just wipe your fucking...  I'm not viewing Jimmy fucking wiping his ass.  I saw him do it.  You just got to make sure.  I do.  Dude, please.  Get a look.  I don't want to...  I don't want to...  You don't need to ask twice with Jimmy.  Twice with the same paper.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  There you go.  There you go.  Wonderful.  Jesus.  There we go.  Here we go.  Twice with the same paper. 
[03:05:00]  All right, Bobby's wiping...  And I dug it in there.  Bobby's wiping his ass.  How deep did you get it?  Did you go inside with the finger?  No, I just rubbed it.  I'll go with the finger.  Hang on.  It's caught in my fat ass.  Hang on.  I'm actually...  He's going to pull out an umbrella.  He's so happy.  He looks so happy.  This is what he wanted to happen, and it's happening.  Oh, he's pulling out a hair.  I pulled out one of my girlfriend's hairs.  I hope it is a girlfriend's hair.  There you go.  Is it clean?  It's pretty clean, man.  There you go.  It's pretty good.  Wonderful.  Lou?  It's pretty good.  Good for you.  Yeah, enjoy yourselves.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  How awkward do you feel now?  I'm not doing that.  If I did it by myself, I'd feel awkward.  But if little Jimmy, me and him play a little game...  Jimmy...  Oh!  Jimmy...  He's throwing it on Craig.  I just missed Craig's head.  But it was clean, though.  I dug it right on my crack.  Yeah.  I loved it.  I had a clean month.  Wow, that was...  Hey, Bob, that was a great game.  Well, who won?  I killed two minutes.  No, look.  I'd say if you get a few people in here that maybe have a dirty ass...  You have a dirty ass?  I think Lou's ass right now.  Oh.  It's fucking...  It looks like fucking Katrina. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, he hasn't showered since his last show.  Dude, I got butterscotch pudding once again today.  I'm not doing it.  Oh, come on.  Just do it.  It's leaking out.  Just test it.  I love that.  Test it.  I want to see your...  Too much wasabi with my sushi, I think.  How about E-Rock?  E-Rock?  E-Rock.  What do you say, E?  What do you say?  Come on.  Just clean.  You probably pulled out.  There's a light on it.  Oh, you shot it already?  Adult wipes.  Get some homemade mustard on that wet nap.  I would have too much homeless guy dick blood on mine.  Oh, I hear you.  I hate that.  Are we going to do...  It's kind of embarrassing. 
[03:06:30]  Come on, Ope.  Wipe one down.  Let's see what you got.  Come on.  Just do it.  It'll be fun.  I'm doing an extreme male camel toe tomorrow.  Don't worry.  I'm bringing in my strides.  Oh, just whip it down.  That's my thing.  I'll do that tomorrow.  Give it a swipe.  Just take a swipe and let's see what you got down there.  Be a man.  Get Steve or Danny.  He'll do it for you.  Someone else has...  I want E-Rock to do it.  Someone else has to do it.  Yeah, E-Rock's doing it.  There you go.  Is this used, this one?  No.  Are you sure?  I threw it out.  Relax.  That's clean.  We're going to reuse him.  You can't reuse him. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  He's going to have a shit shroud of tauren on his...  All right, wait.  But you got to get it nice.  You got to get from the taint all the way up to the ass crack.  Why don't you assist?  Go do it for him, Bobby.  Nice.  Why don't you help him out there?  Hey, look.  I made the game.  I want it to be done correctly.  Rub it in there.  Get it in there, sweetie.  You got plump little buttocks.  It's cold.  Yeah, it's cold.  I know it's cold.  Actually, stick your finger in there a little bit.  Come on.  Stick your finger in.  Somebody wrote, it's wipe it out Wednesday.  What do you got?  There's some hair, but it's clean. 
[03:07:30]  We're a fucking very hygienic show.  Dan?  Yeah, I'm very good.  Dan?  What do you got in there?  All kinds of stuff.  Is it bad?  No.  You got a dirty crack?  What do you have?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Someone's got to wipe their crack.  What the fuck?  Craig.  Craig, why don't you wipe your crack?  Craig, wipe your crack.  Craig is the star of the dodgeball video.  Most likely, it is going to be dirty.  Really?  That's the joke.  No one wants to clean assholes.  Clean assholes are boring.  It's going to look like you just ate chocolate chip cookies.  It's going to be like dog food. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  He's getting in there.  He's getting in there.  He's actually.  This kid ain't shot.  He's squatting.  He's squatting like I tell my daughter to when I have to wipe her in a parking lot.  That's clean.  Wow, Bob.  This is a terrific bit.  Well, I'm sorry that nobody has a dirty asshole for you.  Oh, for six.  I'm telling you.  I say, oh, you should give it away.  Oh, you got a nice hot mustard sandwich down there.  And I say you should take it out.  It's bad.  I'm not.  Get your goddamn, get your Frenchie's mustard right on that napkin.  Just the one.  It better be a cool, refreshing wipe. 
[03:08:30]  Your ass will be clean.  Everybody you know, you got a clean ass.  If Lou does it, I'll do it.  All right, Lou.  I'm not doing it.  Oh, well.  Lou's good.  Is your ass really dirty?  Yeah.  No, I mean, it might be.  I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, look, if you want to say my asshole's dirty, go ahead.  I think Lou.  Okay, your asshole's dirty.  There you go.  Enjoy that.  No fucking tricks aren't going to work.  I actually took a shit in my pants just now.  Louie wants to be legit.  He doesn't want a story coming out that he was wiping.  Oh, I don't look.  Have you seen any of the videos on his website?  Yeah, we were playing them yet.  He's talking about his videos, first of all, going to be some of the funniest fucking videos. 
[03:09:00]  You guys are welcome to start saying that I'm gay right now.  Who says anything?  But I just don't feel like putting my hand with a wipey in my asshole and showing it to Bob Kelly.  All right, we got somebody else.  Oh, Danny, this could be really ugly, man.  That's funny.  You know he just ate hot wings and drank a ton of beer last night.  He's going to be a tequila worm on it.  He's going to have five different color hairs on it.  All right, Danny, what do you think?  Well, my gases haven't been pretty this morning. 
[03:09:30]  What?  So it might be a little...  Does it look like baby food carrots?  My ass is so wet.  I know mine's bad because it's been kind of itchy all the time.  You got to be careful, though.  Sometimes it's not shit.  Sometimes it's just that oily prostate fluid that seeps out.  A little tahini sauce.  All right, where do I need it?  I got to go in the bathroom.  Well, everyone's been...  What everyone did, Danny.  Yeah, we're going to make you happy.  Yeah, everyone else has just been kind of like sneaking a swipe while everyone kind of  talks. 
[03:10:00]  Get in there.  Just dig it in.  Get your two fingers.  There's rules to this.  You got to get your two fingers, wrap it around there, and take a nice swipe up the door.  Let's all wipe our assholes and show it.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You know what?  You're what they call a party pooper.  No pun intended.  Yes.  Exactly.  Party pooper.  Oh, look at you.  Did you get in there, though?  Yeah, no.  Get down at your...  No, Danny's going to do the right thing.  You got to bend down to open it up.  Danny will do the right thing.  He's...  Now swipe it.  He's the real deal. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  Did he get stuck?  I got a little something.  Oh!  Oh, God.  What are you?  I got a little something.  And now Bob's going to throw up.  Come here, Bobby.  Why did...  This is what he...  Bobby, go show him.  He wanted to throw up.  Go show him.  I want to show him.  What's wrong with this guy?  Bobby, come over here.  Danny just wants to show you.  Danny doesn't...  He's throwing...  He's going to throw up now.  Yeah.  He's throwing up.  He's fucking vomiting.  Why do you vomit so easily?  But you brought the whole thing on yourself, you fucking freak.  Take a look at it. 
[03:11:00]  Take a look at it.  Bobby, smell it.  You're battered like you wanted.  What does it look like, Bobby?  Jesus Christ.  What's wrong with this guy?  Look, it's a new game.  I didn't know it was going to make...  You made it up.  Dude, you made up the game.  You wanted this to happen.  Bobby, just smell it.  Just smell it.  Just smell the paper.  You're out of your fucking mind.  I'll give you a bucket.  Bobby, you're mine.  He did exactly what you told him to do.  Smell it.  Bobby.  Bobby, what does it look like?  What does it look like?  Everyone in the radio?  He's eight.  Just describe.  He's got...  Hang on one second. 
[03:11:30]  It looks like he...  Please throw that away.  Jesus Christ.  Just show him.  Hold it up, Danny.  He's got to describe it.  He can't remember.  Jesus Christ.  I've got to better look at it.  It's...  No, take a look and then describe it.  Keep it right here.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Take it.  Yeah, it's very nasty.  Oh, God.  It looks like...  He ate a hot fudge sundae or something.  It's a little...  Bob, you need fucking help.  It looks like someone took a baby wipe  and then tried to pick up a Hershey kiss with it. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, that's sweet.  Bobby, there you go.  There's your contest.  Bobby, five bucks if you put it on your head.  Five bucks to put it on your head.  I didn't know that was...  Ugh.  No, you didn't know.  Because you told him for a half an hour  how to take two fingers  and make sure he gets every bit of it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're amazed  that there's a little bit of shit on it  that made you puke.  That's right, Dad.  Fucking relax.  Jesus Christ.  I bet you if Louie swiped it,  it would look like a paintball accident.  It would.  We got a call from Canada.  You know what that means.  Oh, no.  What?  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys? 
[03:12:30]  Hey.  Hey, your country doesn't matter.  Steve, Toronto.  Damn it.  I figured this is Bob Kelly's way  of losing some weight.  Why don't you go eat a decoded piece of crap?  Canada never disappoints.  Yep.  It has been pointed out  on some of the fan sites  that Canada calls suck.  Canada's...  But thanks for standing on guard for thee.  Whatever the fuck that means.  That's all right,  but you gave it a shot.  Thank you for not mattering above us.  We don't even pay attention. 
[03:13:00]  There's a million easy ways  to get into this country.  Whatever, dude.  Have fun.  All right.  I got the latest news coming in here.  We got some things happening in the world.  Nature's fury.  A heat wave blamed in nearly a dozen deaths  continues to bake large parts of the South.  People are dying from the heat in the South.  Yep.  I was just...  The Phoenix was 115 degrees.  And you were jogging.  Yeah, I was jogging.  Yeah.  It felt good.  But all those people...  Imagine if he wiped his ass 
[03:13:30]  after a 115 degree jog there, Bobby.  It would have smelled nice.  Yeah, it would have smelled like snake shit.  It would have been fantastic.  Are you coming back to life?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I was just thinking of something.  What?  Another contest?  No, I mean, look,  I'm just trying to add to the show.  That's all.  It is.  It's a weird...  If you could do a weird form of bulimia,  like you try to get yourself  to a place where you...  Like it's weird kind of sexual humiliation  and then vomiting  because of some guy's shit.  That's how Bob feels about himself.  It's so weird.  Well, it's actually... 
[03:14:00]  And then you regret it immediately.  It's a weird cycle.  It's really interesting to watch that happen.  Well, I didn't think I was going to puke.  I've never really...  You're assuming that shit just makes me puke.  I don't see shit all the time, Lou.  Do you ever hold it in your mouth?  Wow.  Do you ever hold shit in your mouth?  What the fuck was that?  Hold shit in your mouth like a cigar?  Like just hold it there?  No, like you're on your back  and they drop a log in your mouth  and it stands up  and then kind of tips over  on the side of your face  and you go, uh-huh.  Oh, God.  Have you really done that?  No, I didn't say I have. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  Exactly.  I didn't say I have.  And what are you going to say to him, Lou?  Talk to him.  Go ahead.  Well, he knows what he wants.  That's the thing.  Like he just goes to a woman  and says shit in my face  and I'll hold it in my mouth for a second  and then watch it fall like a tree.  He just does that.  But you go, let's have this contest  and then you go,  I don't want to do it.  You pretend you don't want to do it  for a minute  and then you really get into it  and then you see shit  and you vomit.  And he's rooting for a dirty asshole  the whole time.  He's rooting.  Yeah, rooting.  Yeah, you were kind of disappointed, right?  He was.  Even Danny's ass was relatively clean. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  Well, not really.  Imagine licking Danny's ass  without that fucking light thing  and that bad of a smell.  There was shit on the thing.  I didn't get a good look then.  It's not even near clean.  I didn't get a good look then.  Ours was relatively clean  because there was a couple of hairs,  maybe a little ass oil.  I saw like a light crayon-like thing.  It was a brown smudge.  Smudge.  Yeah.  You know, years ago  when I got blown  in a condemned building  on 23rd Street  on a dirty mattress on the floor  by some woman 
[03:15:30]  with chunks out of her hair  and then her boyfriend  tried to beat me up  and I ran away.  Why?  And then I'm standing outside  because the whole point was  suck my dick,  take my $10  and then mug me  and take everything else.  I don't know why she was  fucking bothered to blow me.  You almost were part of that shit.  Yeah, it was really bad.  See, but anyway,  when I was standing outside  and my dick felt weirdly gross  from having been blown  by this woman,  I might be dead in the ear  from what I just caught.  I almost just died  and I'm covered with sweat.  I realized  I was after this feeling right here. 
[03:16:00]  Like,  every decision I made  was just me wanting  to feel this fucked up.  Wait, did you come?  Did you come?  And wrong and...  What?  Did you come?  Yeah.  Now,  how did you know  the boyfriend  wanted to beat you up?  Because she said,  like,  get him or something.  Like,  I came out of the room  and he was standing there  and she said,  hey,  get him quick  before he...  And I ran away  and I had to run away  from both of them.  How slow were they?  I got out of the building.  You just came.  They were dumb.  Yeah,  they were dumb.  Yeah,  shouldn't you have had  wobbly legs still?  Yeah.  No,  I can't...  Was he big?  He was scrawny  but,  you know, 
[03:16:30]  nothing to lose,  kind of dangerous,  you know?  Gross people.  But anyway,  what I'm saying is  this is what Bob does  with his legs.  Hold on,  what was the turn?  He gets himself  in these situations  where he feels bad.  But Louie,  what was the turn on there?  She was a mess.  Yeah,  and you were in a really,  like,  awful,  like...  It was a bad,  bad scene.  Yeah,  I'm just wiping my ass.  You're fucking an AIDS whore  in a fucking condemned building.  She has patches of hair missing  and her boyfriend's watching,  you fucking faggot.  How the fuck am I?  No,  he wasn't there  while I was being blown. 
[03:17:00]  Jesus Christ.  What was through up  after somebody showed you  their shit  that you begged them  to show you?  Well,  I didn't know  I was going to puke on shit.  In a contest.  I really don't know  what's going to make me puke.  That's what the thing is.  You puke at everything.  Ah,  just shit makes me puke.  We haven't given you  one thing that I want to puke.  You don't know  what makes you puke  except for shit makes you puke.  Shit makes me puke.  And you begged the guy  to wipe his asshole  and show you.  Let's not get carried away.  I'm not a fucking audience member,  Lou,  like you asshole.  I fucking didn't beg him.  I wasn't going to blow him. 
[03:17:30]  I'm not trying to make you feel bad.  I'm just fascinated.  You brought up this idea  like people don't know this.  You have brought this idea  up with me  a few times off air.  Bob's getting a little upset, Bob.  Well, I'm sorry.  Why are you upset?  I don't mean to upset you, Bob.  It's fascinating to me.  Not really?  Okay, good.  It is.  All right.  You're one of my favorite guys, Bob.  I love you.  I love you too.  I love you too.  I love you too.  I love you too.  I love you too.  I love you too.  I once had a rush  swat over my chest  and I told her  you didn't use suppositories  and she said no  and she went to shit 
[03:18:00]  and a fucking suppository  bounced off my chest  and then a fucking  a pile of wet meatloaf  fell onto my stomach  and it reeked.  It reeked of fucking  like ethnic food.  You've never seen life  until you've seen  a fucking suppository  bounce off your own chest.  A pile of digested  couscous  and lamb.  It looked like pot roast.  I don't know what it was.  It had an awful  like a sour  foreign food stench to it.  It was horrendous. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, God.  She had some Ethiopian elk  just a wet pile  on my stomach  and I'm like  what happened  when I was younger  that caused this  to be the way  I jerk off.  What are you jerking off?  What else am I supposed to do?  Fucking read  and miss the whole thing?  You miss the whole thing.  I just don't.  I'm a fighter.  Pardon my French.  I'm going to open  this hole like this.  Robert,  you want anyone else  to wipe their asses?  No, I'm good.  You alright with that?  I'm good. 
[03:19:00]  I'm good, Ope.  Thank you.  I'm good  and that's my last idea  I'd give you.  Hey, it gave me something.  It would have been great  if you turned everything  against me,  you son of a bitch.  He never wants  to team play.  Hey, this is a good idea.  No one wants to hear  team player.  That's true.  They really don't, Bob.  That's true.  Alright.  Alright.  At about 1.30 in the morning  on April 12th,  William Lewis walked  down the hall  at Texas Women's Hospital.  That white bundle  in his hands?  His four-day-old  baby girl.  Several minutes later, 
[03:19:30]  a Houston police officer  shot Lewis with a taser  and the baby, Carla,  crashed to the floor.  Officer David Bowling  and the sheriff's deputy  claim they thought  Lewis was kidnapping  his baby.  Lewis contends  he and his wife  just wanted to leave  the hospital  and simply  did not follow  hospital rules.  So the guy  got tased.  He got tased  for leaving the hospital  with his baby  without a wristband  or something.  Yeah, well,  they don't know.  I mean,  they try to talk  to the guy. 
[03:20:00]  There's a history  with this guy  of domestic violence  with his woman.  How do they know?  What, do they look him up  before they fucking tase him?  I don't know.  That might just be  stuff I found out after,  but the guy was being  entrenched.  They got a baseball card  for his wife beating?  But wait,  look at his stats.  Let's tase this motherfucker.  We need more in the story  because it gets to the point  where they're tasing him  as he's leaving the hospital  with his cousin.  The babies have little bracelets.  It's really genius,  so you can't steal babies.  Yeah, but did they tell him  put the baby down  or put the baby back  and he kept walking?  I think they did.  I don't know.  They were trying to talk to him.  He wasn't being cooperative, 
[03:20:30]  but they didn't just go yes  or hit four  and then zap him.  You don't take somebody  who's fucking holding a baby?  I agree,  but he's a big guy.  It doesn't seem right  when she says the baby  crashed to the floor.  It's a baby.  It's not a crash to the floor  like a bunch of tin cans  and a...  Yeah, it's a little baby.  The 22-year veteran officer  appears to arrive  at the incident  holding his taser.  Under this circumstance,  when you know  you've already got  an issue up there,  you've already got  a large male suspect  who's already agitated  and already threatening,  you'd already come up 
[03:21:00]  with your taser.  After a couple of minutes  of talking,  Lewis Bowling  shoots his taser.  When the Houston father  went down,  the baby did as well.  Lewis claims  the newborn fell on her head  and suffered severe injuries.  After the fall,  officers handed the baby  to her stunned mother.  She has since spoken out  against the officer  and defended her husband.  Wow.  I've got to wonder  what kind of a moron  would tase an adult  holding a baby,  said George Kirkham,  a former police officer  and criminologist 
[03:21:30]  at the University  of California, Berkeley.  It doesn't take rocket science  to realize the baby's  going to fall.  Yeah, man.  You're not going to hold  on to the ball.  Yeah.  Hold on to the ball.  Hold on to the baby.  When the guy's tased.  The guy's dying  to use that taser.  The elevators would not move  because wristband sensors  on each baby  shut off the elevators  if anyone takes an infant  without permission.  Yeah, you can't get out.  You can't get out.  How come the father  wasn't wearing a wristband?  I don't know, but...  Because they always give  the father a wristband. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, perfect, Jimmy.  Perfect.  I still have my wristbands  from when my daughters  were born so I can go  steal babies.  Why not?  Fuck them and eat them.  Wow.  The thing is,  they don't turn it off.  I could have two for lunch.  Wait, here's this guy.  Brooklyn Ace knows  a little more.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, I have a feeling  I have the same article  in front of me as you do  because I sent it in to Steve.  The part that I found him  using was Child Protective  Services has custody  of baby because of a history  of domestic violence  between Lewis and his wife,  Jacqueline Gray.  First of all,  why does she have  a different last name?  Sounds like there's  a huge issue here.  But it's like...  What?  Right.  Now, you're raising a point.  No, it's not.  My wife and I  have different names.  No, but he's ready.  This guy's right, though.  Why would you... 
[03:23:00]  All right.  All right, Brooklyn Ace.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  That's right.  Hey, K-Rock's doing something  because their phones  just exploded.  Let's see what they're doing.  Can we answer their phones?  Oh, come on.  How do I get over here?  Hey, K-Rock.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Why are you calling?  Win the concert tickets?  Yeah, what concert tickets? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, shit.  What concert tickets?  Larry, you can't curse.  You're on the radio.  Yeah, what tickets  are you calling for?  The Velvet Revolver one?  Ah, yes.  For the Velvet Revolver tickets.  That's right, sir.  What caller do you need to be?  This is Heath from Long Island.  I didn't ask your name.  I don't give a shit.  They don't pay me enough  to know you.  And what's the magic phrase  that pays?  Hurry, hurry.  We've got to move on.  How do you get your tickets?  Hmm? 
[03:24:00]  All right, next.  K-Rock.  Hey, am I calling 92?  You are calling for what?  Calling for the Velvet Revolver tickets.  And what did we tell you to say?  What's that?  What's the magic phrase?  Yeah, you have to say something  to get the tickets.  Eh.  Hurry, hurry.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Ah, I don't remember.  I'm going 92.  You're calling 92.  You won the tickets 
[03:24:30]  as long as you say...  Shit in the mouth of Christ.  K-Rock.  Hey, you're right there.  Hey, what's up?  How are you, sir?  Why are you calling us today?  I'm trying to win some tickets.  That's right.  What tickets?  All right, I'm hoping Project Revolution.  Asshole!  Project Revolution.  And what caller do you have to be?  Number nine.  Yeah, you're number eight. 
[03:25:00]  I'm sorry, sir.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, hello.  Hello?  Hello, yeah.  Did I win?  Hello?  Is the caller there?  Hello?  Yes, hello, yes.  Hello?  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  Hello?  What's your name?  Yeah, Mike.  Mike Pasolov.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes, hello.  All right, cool.  So what caller are you?  The phrase that pays, right? 
[03:25:30]  What?  Yes.  What caller are you?  I'm caller number 93.  What tickets are you looking for?  You're right.  You're calling 93,  but we're looking for caller 92.  Thanks for calling.  Sorry, sir.  Hello?  Did I win?  That depends.  Oh, he's one of ours.  Hello?  Hi, am I calling 92?  Hey.  Hello?  How you doing?  Hello?  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  The caller's there. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, what's going on?  How are you?  Hello?  Hi, this is Lenny.  How are you?  Okay.  How are you?  I'm great.  Am I calling number 92?  Am I calling number 92?  I don't know.  Somebody said this is caller 92.  What's going on?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  So who's the caller 92?  Do I call a 92?  Who's this?  My name's Pat.  What? 
[03:26:30]  No.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is the caller there?  Yes, I'm here.  What's going on?  Hold on one second.  Hello?  The caller's here.  Hello?  Hello?  Is the caller there?  Yes, I'm here, man.  What's going on?  Hello?  Oh, hello?  Is the caller there? 
[03:27:00]  Yes, it's here, Lenny.  What's up, man?  Where's the female?  Hello?  Is the caller there?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay, yeah.  Is the guy there?  Yes, the guy's here.  What's up, boy?  What caller are you?  Is the girl there?  92.  Is the girl there?  Yes, yes, yes.  Is the guy there?  I'm here.  Guy there?  Can't hear him.  Yes.  Girl there?  Yes.  You ready to go on the air?  You ready to go on the air right now?  Yes.  All right.  Get ready.  Here we go.  Time for the prize patrol.  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:27:30]  92.3 K-Rock, who do we have on the line?  Lenny, what's going on, man?  How are you?  Is the girl there?  Yes.  Is the guy there?  Yeah, man.  Girl?  Hello?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  This is great.  Come on, man.  Who's going to get him?  You've got to fight it out.  Will it be the girl or the guy?  Come on, man.  Come on.  I'm at work, man.  I can't.  Let's go.  Where are you?  I'll come down and get the tickets right now. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  How about this?  Insult contest.  Let's go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Info contest?  Yeah.  What do you got to say to the broad?  What do I got to say?  I don't know.  You said info.  What kind of info do you want?  I'll give you some answers.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  Is the girl there?  Yeah.  What do you have to say for yourself?  What?

There you go.  Are you serious? 
[03:28:30]  Yes.  Go ahead.  Well, why the hell should she get him since I was the first caller in 92?  Boo.  That wasn't that good.  All right, girl.  It wasn't.  I don't know.  Girl, come back.  Let's go.  What do you got for him?  Hello?  Yeah.  Insult the guy on the line.  Insult the other guy and you win the tickets.  You don't know who she's at, man.  Come on.  This girl doesn't even know.  She's not even in the city, doesn't it?  It doesn't sound like she's got some accent from Long Island or some dick-ass accent.  Come on, man.  What do you got to say about that, lady? 
[03:29:00]  Look, she doesn't even know what planet she's at.  About what?  She's not paying attention.  Miss, you got to.  Come on.  We're having an insult contest.  Hello?  You got to insult the guy.  Yeah, we're having an insult contest.  He's beating you up.  What do you have to say to the guy that's on the phone with you?  Hello?  Hey.  She has nothing to say.

You have to insult the other guy, and if you say something mean, you win, twat.

You're the fucking retard.  Sorry.  I'm ruining it.  They still think they're on the radio.  What are you doing?  You're on the radio, miss.  You have to insult the guy, and you're not insulting him.  You're just being the silly hole that you've always been.  Whoever does the best insult, you two shitheads, wins. 
[03:30:00]  That's right.  Wipe your ass with a baby wipe and hold it up.  If it's got a log on it, you win fucking tickets, and Slash will shit in your mouth.  Come on.  Come on, you guys.  We're telling you of what do you want to hear.  That's right.  I, I, I.  Guess the phrase that pays, and Ted Nugent will kick you in the cunt.  Come on.  K-Rock rocks.  Come on.  That's not the phrase that pays your fucking, you silly, titless nothing. 
[03:30:30]  Hey, what's, what's the girl's name?  We got an idea from Nate Sack.  Uh, girl's name, what's your name?  Pat.  Hey, hey, Pat, can you repeat after me?  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I sucked what for K-Rock?  No, I suck cock for K-Rock.  You hear it perfectly except for the word cock.  Dumb reet.  What?  You can't put that on the radio.  Yes, you can.  We're going to beep it.  It's okay.  Yeah, we're trying to be a little edgier with the, you know, the station, so we'll bleep 
[03:31:00]  that part.  So after me.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I suck what for K-Rock?  Again.  Perfect pitch hearing.  Hear me.  Except for the thing that's constantly in her mouth.  I'm a professional DJ.  Repeat after me.  Are you ready?  Okay.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I suck cocks for K-Rock.  Wow.  You're bad.  You're bad.  Sir, it's your turn.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Let's let the other guy get an opportunity.  Now the guy has to say it. 
[03:31:30]  What's your guy, what's your name, sir?  You talking to me now, sir?  Yeah.  Yeah, what's your name?  My name is Lenny, man.  Do you have a sucker guy's cock?  I'm going to get some laughs out of you guys.  I'm not getting some tickets, obviously, but at least this is entertaining.  Well, Lenny, why don't we do this?  Why don't you repeat after me, okay?  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I refuse to say that, man.  Hell no.  You don't want the tickets, then?  I want them.  I want them.  Hold on, you silly hole.  We're talking to Lenny.  Pat's going to get the tickets unless you say the phrase, Lenny.  I'm not saying that phrase. 
[03:32:00]  I'll say all the phrases at that.  I don't go that way.  All right, how about that?  We've got tickets.  We've got backstage passes.  We also got a limo to and from the show.  And your mother's cunt in a box.  Yeah.  Exactly, boss.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then we're going to fuck you with a broomstick.  Or a broom.  Or if we have a broom, we'll use that.  What the fuck is that?  B-R-U-M?  We have a broom.  All right, we obviously got a problem here.  We got two winners on the line.  We can only give it to one.  All right, let's give these.  How about we have a masturbation contest? 
[03:32:30]  First person to come wins the tickets.  What do you say, guys?  Come on, I said what you wanted me to say.  I should win.  She feels dirty now.  Yeah, she does.  Do you feel a little dirty?  I hope some of this makes it on the radio, at least.  This is not bad.  All right, whoever said it.  My husband and my son would kill me if this makes it on the radio.  Really?  No, you shouldn't have said it then, you fucking titless junk.  Who am I?  Exactly.  Sonny boys didn't know you suck cock for K-Rock.  What do you think of them apples?  Hi, I hope you enjoy Velvet Revolver, Sonny. 
[03:33:00]  I fucking drank a set of seeds for it.  That's right.  Set?  Seeds?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You guys are nuts.  What's your favorite radio show in all of New York City?  92-3 K-Rock.  That's a station, you stupid twat.  Oh, we're talking about a radio show.  What show?  What show?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ugh.  All right.  How are you? 
[03:33:30]  Fuck you.  Sock off.  You suck off.  Fuck off.  You fucking useless act.  You piece of crap.  Jesus Christ.  Why does everyone like them?  Here's what you win.  Tom Petty's going to staple your pussy lips.  All right.  Hey, what's your name, Pat?  Is that board over there?  All right.  Listen, we're going to put you both on hold, and we're going to try to do something with  you, all right?  Just hold on.  We'll be right back.  Hold on to the line.  Do not hang up.  We're going to pick one to give the tickets to.  Or we might give them to both of you.  That's a good idea.  All right.  Just put them on hold.  What's your favorite station to suck cock, Tuck? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, God.  That's where you have to say the call letters.  All right.  Ready?  We're rolling tape.  Here we go.  Rolling tape.  What's your favorite station to suck cock to?  K-Rock.  Still trying.  Damn.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  Hold on to the line.  There they go.  All right.  ....com.  Oh, they're in commercials over there.  Oh, God. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll do line of the day next and get the fuck out of here.  Oh, my God.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  I think we've done enough damage here today. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  We didn't even get to talk about Britney being a lesbo.  Is she a lesbo?  No.  She looked a puss.  Yeah, there's going to be an article coming out.  How do you think she got pregnant?  In OK Magazine.  Sure.  Somebody fucking spilled a load into her by accident.  They walked by and tripped with a beaker of a tube.  She kept this.  A beaker.  At least 15 women in her life.  Porn stars coming forward.  She supposedly hit on Jenna Jameson. 
[03:35:30]  So what?  Also, Tara Patrick has a story or two, supposedly.  Oof.  And Anonymous, former employee, has sources.  I wonder if Britney broke wind in Tara's face or Tara broke wind in.  That's my fantasy.  Yeah.  See Britney.  I love that people are acting like that's ripping her down from some great.  Like she's the president.  Yeah.  She ate a pussy.  Oh, that whore ate a pussy.  I'll never not buy her music again.  No one's going to be buying anything she puts out from this day forth like it cares.  Like it matters, I mean. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  Let's do a line of the day.  I agree.  We used up all the energy in that last 10 minutes.  I like the seat, by the way.  Yeah.  Here's the first runner-up line of the day.  I still have my wristbands from when my daughters were born so I can go steal babies.  Why not?  Fuck them and eat them.  Why didn't that win?  That should be number one.  But that just happened, you lazy fucks. 
[03:36:30]  That's a second to her.  Why does the line of the day always happen the last five minutes of the show?  What did he say?  Dan's fucking calling you stupid.  No.  No, it's a great line.  But I'm very suspicious when the line of the day or runner-up line of the day comes from  the last five minutes of the show.  That's all.  May I borrow this, Bob?  Sorry.  It's actually more difficult to throw this together at the last minute.  Ooh.  Yeah.  All right.  That looks so.  Why?  And who's going to argue with him?  He could knock your teeth out with one spin of his cock.  Fucking Kung Fu Leroy.  With his fucking long, smooth cock. 
[03:37:00]  And his doll eyes.  With some fucking bumps at the base.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Right.  63, and then all those zeros, and then it says in print, billion dollars.  So he wants that.  But he wants it backed by gold and silver, delivered via UPS.  What is he, a bond villain?  UPS.  United States parcel service to the...  Fuck, I stepped over and scrape line.  Damn it!  Try harder. 
[03:37:30]  Note to self.  Take away a star.  It'd be funny if the next runner-up was what you just said.  And I write it down.  Listen better.  Say, yeah, God, do it.  Listen better.  All right.  Very good line from Anthony, who hopefully will be back tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's picking his girl.  She's okay.  And then we got Washington live show for our day.  Washington.  Washington.  Lots of things going on for the Washington.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say the XM.  We're having the car crash comedy.  It's going to be played, actually, on Free FM.  Or whatever the fucking terrestrial thing is down there. 
[03:38:00]  So come down for car crash comedy.  You get to go up and do...  You have to email our own gay, Sam.  It's sam at foundrymusic.com.  But in the heading, you have to write car crash comedy, faggot.  And that's how he knows to take you seriously.  Otherwise, he won't even read it.  He won't even know what...  He literally doesn't understand things that aren't addressed.  It's a great concept we did in Philly, man.  These guys, none of them have been on radio to begin with.  They do it in front of about 20 listeners.  And so they tell jokes? 
[03:38:30]  So the pressure's on.  And then we sit there.  And if we don't like a joke, we car crash them.  They get three car crashes.  And then they're out.  It's a great concept, man.  And it's in front of the whole audience?  Oh, no, no.  It was in front of like 25 people of listeners.  Before the show.  But they're going to get to...  No, no.  They're in there watching.  It's like a room like this with people.  Just imagine this room with 25 people.  And you're a guy that's never really done radio.  But you think you're funny.  You step up to the mic and try to tell jokes as everyone's staring at you.  And you try to last for three crashes.  Try to last as long as you can.  That's great.  It's either what?  Two minutes or three crashes.  Right.  And the winner will get to go on the Traveling Virus show and perform in front of a bunch 
[03:39:00]  of people.  So they're all comics.  But they're new comics.  They're young comics.  So a guy will get to perform in front of 10,000 people.  And I've got to call Kid Chris because the guy that won Car Crash Comedy in Philly wants  out.  I know.  He doesn't want to do the show?  He's scared.  He's panicking.  The kid...  The kid.  He's old.  Guys, he's 56.  He's up there.  But he's afraid to work for 10,000 people.  Yeah, but he's funny.  He's funny.  He's four foot eight.  Yeah.  About.  He's diminutive.  He's what?  Diminutive.  He's like a little...  He's like a little thing.  Little fella.  He's a rapable pejoria man. 
[03:39:30]  He's a wee fella.  A wee fella.  He's a wee one.  Before we get to the line of the day, Robert, thank you for some great radio today.  Oh.  Sometimes.  What the fuck was that?  I don't know, dude.  That was so weird.  I was thinking about some other shit.  Were you?  I was just thinking about something else.  No, you weren't sure if I was serious or not.  Yeah, but you gave us great radio again today.  All right.  All right.  Robert Kelly live dot com.  Yo.  Whatever the fuck you're doing.  Yo.  Awesome.  And for me, you can go to my page.  Buy Happy Endings because I'm selling it if you want to. 
[03:40:00]  Sell it on your page?  Still on the bestseller list.  All right.  Thanks for my copy.  It's time for your...  You don't have a copy?  No.  Fuck you.  It's time for your...  Fuck you.

Line of the day.  I don't look at Tracy like that. 
[03:40:30]  We work together.  It's a professional relationship, and I respect what she does as the program director.  Oh, that's weird, because I want to fuck her face.  Kennedy.  That's pretty good.  Louis C.K., Line of the Day.  And Louis's got a big tour he's doing.  It's called Chewed Up.  Chewed Up.  Coming to Kansas City and Madison, Wisconsin, and all sorts of shit.  All the hot spots.  Oh, yes.  Every shitbox city you live in, Louis will be in.  I'll be there.  And please buy Shameless, my DVD on Amazon.  Because Louis wants to do another fucking special, so come out and watch him perform. 
[03:41:00]  I'll do another special.  Come watch it.  Yeah.  Drew Boogie's been just sitting there minding his own business.  Drew, we're going to play your You Need to Be Corrected thing.  That could be like a real song.  You know that.  And you did it with chemistry, right?  Yes.  No, I know it's a real song, but I mean something that you can maybe almost farm out to real  radio stations, not this crap.  Like stations that would play music.  The dynamite.  Yeah.  If they're into playing all the references from this show, yes.  I know, but it goes past that.  There's something about it.  It's cool. 
[03:41:30]  I've not had it.  You haven't heard it?  We're going to end the show with it.  What else you got going on, Drew?  That's it.  Other than that, I'll be back with some other remix.  Here's Drew Boogie.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  No, it's him.  I want my man, Drew.  For you.  And Stacy J.  Yeah.  Get them all for a break.  You're looking for yellow treats, let me hear you say.
