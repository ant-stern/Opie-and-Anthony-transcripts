<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties affecting Anthony's microphone, prompting on-air troubleshooting.  A caller informed them that Lex and Terry's show had spent hours discussing them, which Opie and Anthony dismissed, highlighting their listeners' online retaliation against Lex and Terry.  The recurring "Whip Him Out Wednesday" segment followed, featuring listener anecdotes about displaying Opie and Anthony stickers on their vehicles.  The hosts then launched into a prolonged mocking of Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's speech patterns, employing derogatory language. They graphically described and commented on a news story about a “mermaid baby” with severe birth defects, using crude and offensive humor.  Bob Kelly was expected as a guest later in the show.

The next segment opened with the hosts using highly offensive language to describe unattractive women, followed by a caller, Dave from Detroit, recounting a story about a client born without an anus.  This transitioned into a discussion of a baby born with a parasitic head, again using derogatory terms.  The hosts further insulted an intern for failing to bring paperwork.  They then graphically detailed a case of conjoined twins, speculating on their lives and relationships. A caller mentioned another instance of conjoined twins and a horrific bus crash video.  Two topless women, body-painted to simulate business attire, arrived to promote a film channel, prompting sexually suggestive comments from the hosts. A caller described his Elephant Man-like neighbor.  Jerry then called to discuss his son's hypospadias, leading to more sexually explicit jokes and comments about the women's bodies.  Bob Kelly's increasingly uncomfortable reactions culminated in him vomiting.

The following segment started with crude jokes about a woman being painted, focusing on her breasts.  The focus shifted to a lengthy, humorous audio clip of Bob Kelly describing a football injury, with his cries of pain, especially "Hold my hand, man," becoming a recurring joke.  Callers shared their own injury stories.  A phone interview with Jennifer Tilly followed, discussing her career and boyfriend's poker playing, including her role in "Seed of Chucky". The segment concluded with more banter about Kelly's injury and the upcoming DVD release of the footage.

The next segment opened with one of the hosts (possibly Ed) farting on air, attributed to nervousness about Jennifer Tilly's call.  A discussion about an XM facility party ensued.  A significant portion focused on a news story about a woman tased by a police officer in Florida, including racial slurs and highly inappropriate language.  The “Liddy” yogurt lid joke evolved into a running gag with a foil puppet.  A news story about a Long Island man keeping his wife chained up in the basement with free-roaming leopards was discussed, using excerpts from an interview with the wife, prompting further inappropriate commentary.  A discussion about Neil Armstrong's hair being sold was followed by a search for the source of a particularly pungent fart in the studio. A listener called, and they played audio from Britney Spears' show.  Patty, an in-studio guest with a birthday gift for Opie, became the subject of sexually suggestive jokes and comments, with attempts to get her to expose her buttocks.

The final segment began with ribbing of Patty about her attire and weight, featuring crude jokes about her appearance.  A discussion of a "free coupon" for an "elixir shake" ensued.  The conversation shifted to Howard Stern's alleged role in firing Jack Bronstein from FHM, claiming Stern used his influence after on-air complaints about Bronstein's comments on Beth Ostrowski.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips related to this story and criticized Stern's hypocrisy. The segment ended with a plug for a comedian and mention of the audio clip online, interspersed with fart jokes and crude humor.

[00:03:00]  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  And yeah, we're back.  And yeah, we're back.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for proper.  Here it goes, here it goes.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  The OPN Anthony.  The OPN Anthony.  The OPN Anthony Show.  The OPN Anthony.  The OPN Anthony.  The OPN Anthony.  The OPN Anthony.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it!  That's terrible.  We will be in the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All of the radio rips me off. 
[00:04:30]  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes? 
[00:05:00]  Mom!  Mom!  Please stop calling me.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  You're just a tool.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:05:30]  It is, right?  Wednesday?  It is indeed Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  Your mic sounds totally different today.  How is that?  Is it any good?  Uh-oh.  Is it good?  Is it working?  You sound like you should have that Darth Vader mask on.  I am your father.  Oh, my God.  Is that good?  I don't know how it sounds in Radioland, but through my headphones, it's very deep and silky.  Well, I hope it works, because yesterday I was having problems. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Well, this might work.  Sounds low.  I was...  Oh.  It sounds like volume low?  No, you got a lot of bass in that mic.  A lot of bass.  Well, it was the volume yesterday.  Oh, it's getting driving nuts.  It was kind of screwing with me.  Oh, it's nice.  The volume.  Do you like it?  Sexy.  That's good.  I don't know.  The volume was screw yesterday.  I was listening to the replay on the way home.  Yeah.  And I was getting all mad.  Like, we talk.  That's what we do here on a daily basis. 
[00:06:30]  And then I would do like a little, you know, like a grumbly thing on the side, because it's  too embarrassing or nasty or racist or whatever it is to say at full volume, but usually you  could hear it.  But yesterday, I couldn't hear it.  It's like these little asides.  I can't tell you how many of my great lines no one ever hears.  Why?  I don't know.  I think it's a technical problem.  Is it technical?  Yeah.  I think there's something they have to tweak.  A little tweakage. 
[00:07:00]  I think they need to tweak my brain.  A little tweak.  Tweak your brain.  Let's go to Brad in New Jersey.  Brad, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I just wanted to let you know that you totally have just been ripped off by hoo-hoo-hoo.  He, remember the promo you did where everything you guys said was bleeped out?  Oh, yeah.  He just did the exact same thing.  They had a voice impersonator, supposed to be Tom Chiasano, and he said, remember this  classic, and everything was bleeped out.  So, I guess he doesn't care. 
[00:07:30]  I guess he's having a lot of fun listening to that XM satellite radio and that Escalade,  huh?  Exactly.  All right, Brad.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  I don't want to talk too bad about Howie today.  I don't want to be fired or anything.  Jesus.  It still says, it sounds a lot bassier.  It's way bassier.  Slightly muffled and a little quiet.  And then Big Rich from Jersey says it needs to be louder.  It's absolutely awful.  And a bit clearer.  There's too much bass, Anthony.  Yeah.  Can we fix that on the fly or we have to wait for the end of the show? 
[00:08:00]  Bassier.  Dude, it's really bassier.  You can't hear that in the headphones?  I hear it, yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of like it.  I kind of like it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boop, boop, boop.  Yeah.  You're going to do.  All right.  Anyway, it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I'll do a little thing like this so I can listen on the replay.  Let's hear this.  There we go.  I can hear that.  Yeah, you can hear it.  I can hear it fine, too, because the headphone volume.  Like, I could crank my own headphone volume up so I hear myself, like, really loud. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  But then you listen on the replay, I don't know what's going out over the air.  It could be blasting us out of the studio.  But on the air, it could be.  Anthony, we're fixing your microphone on the fly.  I think we should knock them down to about 400 HZs.  Let's start there.  HZ?  Are you looking at the gauge over there?  Yeah, let's go to 400 HZ over there.  The radar over there, the radar screen.  And let's drop the dB a couple.  Let's get that down to about, let's give it a plus 10. 
[00:09:00]  A plus 10?  Yeah, why not?  You're an ass.  And that graph is a little wacky.  Please don't do anything he's suggesting.  He knows not of what he's doing.  And that wave up there, you can't surf that wave.  Make it a little steeper there.  Is that it?  There you go.  Oh, the gain.  Yeah, let's knock that down a couple.  A couple, uh, a couple, uh, uh, um, things.  A couple of gains.  Yeah, we'll knock that down.  A couple of gain units.  We'll knock that down a couple of gains. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, and yeah, let's keep the phase off.  I think that would be very smart.  The Opie and Barry White show.  The Opie and James Earl Jones show.  It sounds like you have a pillow over your face.  It sounds like you're in the background.  Uh, it sounds like you went through puberty overnight.  It is really weird.  It sounds a little better, so I don't know.  It sounds like Ant's talking through a paper towel tube.  It's not as bad now, Anthony.  I think whatever you were...  Trying to get out from under the counter and taking your mouth off Jimmy's cock. 
[00:10:00]  Well, okay, that could be a problem.  Oh, that's better.  Feels good, sounds bad.  How could you resist?  It sounds a little better.  All right, we'll deal with it.  So, can we go through our BS that we do every Wednesday and tell everyone it's Whip Him Out Wednesday?  Whip Him Out Wednesday!  It's just a great promotion, basically.  Anthony, you want to explain it this time?  Oh, it's so easy.  Maybe explain it differently this week.  It's so easy.  Let me tell you. 
[00:10:30]  You put a wow on your vehicle.  Anywhere.  It could be one of our sanctioned bumper stickers.  Or it could be a sign you made all by yourself.  And then you drive around with it and all of a sudden you're gonna...  You drive around with a wow on your vehicle.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of the stickers or anything.  Well, the stickers also promote the show.  They do.  We love driving around and seeing our names on the back of cars and trucks and stuff. 
[00:11:00]  It's kind of fun.  It's not just for wow.  Yeah, it supports the show.  I like to walk around New York City and just point out to the wow stickers and go,  Hey, that's me.  That's me right there.  That's my name.  You do that too?  Yeah, that's the only reason we have this wow promotion.  It's a clever ruse to...  It's an ego boost for us idiots.  To get you guys to put our names on your vehicle.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  I point at the Anthony part and I go, that's my name.  I go, not just my name.  Like, you know.  Right.  Like Anthony, if you see it somewhere.  I go, but that's my name.  I'm that Anthony.  It's a great way to pick up checks.  You walk around like, that's me.  Hey.  Look what that guy did.  Look at him now.  You drive around with a wow on your vehicle.  And before you know it, some girl sees it, knows what it's all about, and she'll flash you.  Right.  You get a free little view. 
[00:12:00]  It's, uh, you're driving home, you're in traffic, you're miserable, and there it is.  All of a sudden, boom, you see a girl flashing you.  You go, why the, who the, what the?  And then you realize, ah, I got a wow on the back of my car.  And you had been wowed.  That's how it works.  Yeah, it works perfectly.  Beautifully, I should say.  And if you want a wow sticker, just go to opandanthony.com.  You send in a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we send out the wow stickers immediately, okay?  That's how it works.  I think we need some kind of promo that says all this stuff, so we don't even have to bother with it. 
[00:12:30]  We don't have one of those promos running?  When we go, the promos they have running, it's just ridiculous.  I hear Rich Voss advertising gigs he's done already.  Right, right, right.  Why not?  All our hat comedian friends promoting gigs in the middle of nowhere.  My brother whoring out his cover band.  Right.  I hear it.  How about a promo for the wow?  Wow, because the wow thing, it does work, and it helps market the show as well.  All right?  Yeah.  We're mentioning Sync Magazine this month.  Jeff in North Carolina, what's up?  Good morning. 
[00:13:00]  How are you doing?  Pretty good, bro.  I got a magazine this weekend in my mail, and it's called Sync.  Have you ever heard of it?  Yeah, I actually like Sync Magazine.  Okay, on page 30, there's like a comparison chart of what XM has, what Sirius has, called  Battle of Satellite Radio, and there's a listing that shows you guys' picture.  Anthony's in the studio.  You're right next to him.  Anthony's flipping off the bird, and I got some bad news.  They got you listed as shock jocks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shock jocks. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, because the media is lazy.  Yeah, but...  They just need a label for everything instead of like maybe doing some slight research and  homework and maybe tune in the program, and then they would find out, yeah, there's a  shock element to it, but there's also a lot of other things going on in the program.  Our man on the street today is going to take dumps on the sidewalk and see what the people  do.  Right.  Well, like, isn't that like a typical dopey shock jock thing?  Just wanted to say that I'm a new listener.  Shock jocks don't really just sit around and chat about life events.  You know, one of the things they try to get me to do in Buffalo, and we talk about some 
[00:14:00]  of the stuff I had to do in radio.  I was working in Buffalo, and they wanted me to dress as some kind of varmint.  Oh, Jesus.  Never good.  And they wanted me to pop out of a manhole.  Ooh.  Are you kidding?  And, uh...  Like a rat or a...  A gerbil?  What?  A gerbil.  I guess it would be more like a groundhog.  A groundhog.  But the problem is you can't really find a groundhog costume, so it would have been some 
[00:14:30]  other varmint that looked kind of like a groundhog.  Uh-huh.  And they wanted me to pop out of a manhole cover in, like, downtown Buffalo or something.  And then I would be broadcasting live at the morning show, and then we would see if  I saw my shadow.  Well, I just wanted to say...  Oh, hold on, sir.  We have to recover from that.  If you did that, the only shadow you should see is the truck heading towards your skull. 
[00:15:00]  See, I did say no to some things.  Wow.  That is awful.  Go ahead, Jeff.  I just wanted to say I'm a new XM listener.  I've had it since January, and you guys are great.  I'm getting ready for work right now, and you guys are always on the XM.  Let's go to Tom in Kentucky.  Oh, jeez, oh, me.  He was complimenting us.  You are horrible.  That guy just needs a wake-up call.  We definitely appreciate your listening to the show. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  But people get really bored when you start kissing our asses.  We only let you kiss our asses when we're feeling down about ourselves.  We're feeling pretty good today, so we don't need you to kiss our asses.  But that could end.  Let's go to Tom in Kentucky.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  What's up there, sweet pants?  What up, yo?  Hey, man, did y'all know that y'all are supposed to be calling Lex and Terry because, you know,  they need y'all, y'all need them, and the only way that they'll quit tooling on y'all 
[00:16:00]  and quit messing with y'all is if you call and be their friend.  They spent two and a half hours Friday.  They knew y'all were off air.  They were talking about how their people were listening to XM, how they were listening to y'all,  how their interns had to keep running downstairs and talking about how, on Thursday, how y'all  were messing with them, that y'all are nobody, that you've only got five listeners, and come  October, get this, come October, y'all are going bye-bye because that's when Stern comes 
[00:16:30]  on.  Wow.  I think you just set the record for the most y'alls in one phone call, first of all.  I, you know, that's Kentucky folk, we do that, you know.  I gotta tell you, man, I hate this Lex and Terry war, I mean, because if you're not number  one in Jacksonville, Florida, you really haven't achieved much in radio.  That's right.  That's right.  That's where you want to be.  Second of all, don't they realize we slapped them around a bit and now we're just moving  on, it just doesn't matter?  And also, our ONA army, our pests, they attacked Lex and Terry big time and those pussies couldn't 
[00:17:00]  go with it.  Nope.  They screened every one of our listeners, you know, off their program.  So I don't even, we don't even need to acknowledge those phonies anymore.  We don't acknowledge them.  If they're such great radio hosts, why didn't they let one of our listeners through?  Not one.  Not one.  You could tell.  It was just really, really funny because they were trying to make it sound like, you know,  like, oh, they don't bother us, you know, we're bigger than that. 
[00:17:30]  And it's just, they kept, like, two and a half hours, they kept going on.  I was laughing.  My hat was so funny.  Did we spend more than five minutes on them?  I mean, watch this, Tom.  This will be the only phone call we take about Lex and Terry.  They talked about us for two, two and a half hours, like you're saying.  That's playing right into our hands once again.  We just love when people mention our names because it's making us bigger every day.  Simple as that.  And they're a bunch of phonies.  If they really want to take, you know, take on this show, we'll start with our listeners.  This is one of those battles we just let the listeners take care of.  They do just fine on their own. 
[00:18:00]  They don't even need our help.  But unfortunately, those guys screened every one of our listeners' phone calls.  Sorry, I saw you point you down there and I want some of that food.  I'm joking.  I know.  I'm trying to make a great point here and I'm thinking I might have to do the Heimlich.  I'm like, Anthony, Jesus.  I took a bread and the toast is very toasted.  That's how much Anthony cares about Lex and Terry.  He's too busy eating his toasting.  Toasted tuna fish sandwich.  He doesn't give a fuck.  No, the toast is very toasty. 
[00:18:30]  So I took a bite and inhaled at the same time.  It got gravel in my lungs.  A little flick of bread.  Well, I hope Lex and Terry enjoyed their little national exposure.  There you go.  Now it goes away and we move on to other things today.  Stool softener in Indiana.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Morning, Norton.  Hi, mister.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know that early this morning I got my first official wow.  Ah, very nice. 
[00:19:00]  Awesome.  The chick pulled up beside of me.  I'm driving and I'm looking down and she's totally butt-ass naked.  Wait, totally?  Totally.  Or topless?  No, she's totally naked in the passenger seat.  Sounds like a lunatic.  And on the back of my truck it says, wow, O and A, XM Satellite Radio.  And she took a marker out and wrote around one nipple, O.  The other one said A. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, that's a perfect wow for you, Stool softener.  No doubt.  Well, congratulations.  I'm telling you, this wow definitely works.  We've been doing it for many, many years now.  All you have to do is get a wow in your car.  We like seeing the bumper stickers, actually.  So just send a self-addressed stamped envelope into our studios here in New York City  and we'll send them out to you, okay?  The address is up on opiananthony.com.  Thank you.  Thank you, Stool softener.  No problem.  Punch it out.  All right.  We've got some great audio that came in.  Oh, yeah.  Steve just handed in of the mayor of Boston. 
[00:20:00]  Menino.  Our old pal, Mayor Menino.  The life mayor over there.  Jesus Christ.  How long has he been mayor?  Forever.  I know.  The guy just...  The guy's been mayor forever.  Well, we moved to Boston, I think, in 95 maybe?  Uh-huh.  Somewhere around there?  Yeah.  So that's like 10 years ago.  And he was already the mayor?  Yep.  And I think he had it for a while before we even got there.  Yeah.  He did.  They're afraid of change up there.  But how does that work?  I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  There doesn't seem to be any kind of a term limit up there for a mayor.  I don't know.  Are there term limits for mayors anywhere?  I thought you could only do it for a few years.  I don't know.  If they want you, I guess they keep voting you in.  I guess there is because Giuliani couldn't run again.  So it just goes by...  I guess by, you know, city by city, whatever the hell they want to do.  Or city, whatever.  State, Jesus.  Yeah, each city.  And he's been mayor of Boston.  Forever. 
[00:21:00]  Doesn't seem like he's leaving anytime soon.  And he is a blithering idiot.  The guy is retarded.  We point it out all the time.  He has what amounts to a calf's liver for a tongue.  It's just this giant piece of flesh that knocks around in his mouth and obscures everything he tries to say.  Couple that with him being retarded.  The guy is... 
[00:21:30]  He's not very bright.  And his speeches are a joke.  Everything he says.  Everything that comes out of that fat, blubbering mouth of his is...  It sounds retarded.  And Steve found some clips.  Oh, these clips are just great.  The mayor just talking at all these press conferences.  I love it.  Talking at, you know, at...  Well, reading, you know, in class to kids.  Oh, that's what politicians do.  You know, all the stuff that a mayor or a politician would do. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We got audio of him doing.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just awful.  Yeah.  And Steve goes, look, this is the first 13 clips.  Oh, he's got plenty.  He says he could have up to 100.  He could have up to 100 clips of this.  This is like...  This is radio gold.  Love it.  Let's take a listen to the first one.  Are you almost done?  One more little bite.  I'm starving in the morning.  Why can't we...  What?  Why can't we get our food before we get on the air? 
[00:22:30]  It happened once where I actually finished before the mics went on.  Wouldn't it be good to do a show where we're not eating during the show?  Maybe if we actually interviewed people before we had them work for us.  Maybe.  It would really help us out.  I think we should definitely eat before the show because I can't...  First of all, I'm incapable of sitting here and looking at my food.  I would be completely distracted and that would ruin the show.  So I eat and ruin it that way. 
[00:23:00]  It seems logical.  I mean, we're here at 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  Sometimes a little before, so we have a whole hour.  Why don't we eat before the show?  It's very funny because that ecstasy of gold starts playing from the movie The Good, The Bad, The Ugly  because we get a lot of email on that.  And that's when the food arrives to the studio.  That's when the food gets here.  And I have to eat.  I understand.  Nigga, gotta eat, yo.  All right, so here's some clips from...  You get questions about where that song's from?  All the time. 
[00:23:30]  All the time.  It's one of the most frequently asked questions.  Ooh.  Yep.  All right, so here's some audio of Mayor Menino, the mayor of Boston.  And someone else asked if he'd be interested in running for Senator Kerry's seat.  Should he win the nomination?  Let me just say, I will not be a candidate I'll seek if I'll accept the draft.  I will not be candidation.  I will not seek.  Or seek. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  I will not be candidation.  That is fucked up on a whole nother level.  I will not be candidation or seek.  He was obviously trying for the old Johnson speech, I believe it was, where it was, I shall  not seek, nor shall I accept the nomination of my party for President of the United States  of America.  And he just completely screwed it up. 
[00:24:30]  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you.  Notice how Jimmy and I just nodded like, yeah, of course.  Johnson.  Of course it's the Johnson speech.  Well, I think that's what he was going for.  Of course.  We're trying to not say anything, hoping the radio audience thinks that all of us kind  of knew that.  Yeah, of course.  I'd play that role on a daily basis.  That's what you do when I have to talk to this guy.  Oh, that's like it's famous.  Well, of course it's the Johnson speech. 
[00:25:00]  Not accepting the nomination speech.  Would it be cool?  You know.  Oh, the term limits for mayor are in place in New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.  Nowhere else.  Nowhere else.  Is that it?  That's what I'm getting off the instant feedback from Professor Rev from Wackbag.com.  All right.  Well, let's listen to that clip again here.  And someone else says, if you'd be interested in running for Senator Kerry's seat, should 
[00:25:30]  he win the nomination?  Let me just say, I will not be a candidate, I'll seek, but I'll accept the draft.  And why are they laughing?  You got to laugh at him.  Hopefully they're laughing at him and not with his, I think, joke that he was attempting  there.  Oh, I think they were laughing at the draft joke, but wow.  Wow.  This is the mayor of Boston.  Candidation.  I'm about getting the job done.  I want to work on this and get it done in a peacefully way. 
[00:26:00]  I want to get it done in a peacefully way.  In a peacefully way.  Oh, this is the guy that got us thrown out of Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mayor Menino.  Listen to this next one.  Like I said, it's about reinforcing the economic lessons that taught, that taught during the  school day.  Reinforcing the economic lessons that taught, that taught during the day. 
[00:26:30]  What?  What point is he even trying to make?  I have no idea.  Why are you guys playing these clips?  It's hard to understand what he's saying.  Because it makes me look smarter.  This guy is the mayor of Boston.  Yeah.  We've got a few more here.  Listen to this one.  Commissioner Evans is going across the pond.  That's true.  The pond. 
[00:27:00]  Well, that sounds like a misspeak.  I'll give him that one.  You'll give him that one?  Yeah.  Will you give him this one?  I know that Billy Bollinger is president of University of Mass now, of which I am alumnus.  University of Mass, of which I am alumnus.  Alumnus.  I don't know what the word is.  I had no idea. 
[00:27:30]  I'm an alumni.  Alumni.  Right.  Alumnus.  I don't know.  He might be right on that one.  I don't know.  He's got everyone bamboozled up there.  Three non-colle...  Oh, you went to college.  Yeah.  Believe it or not.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to say it like I was shocked.  It came out wrong.  Did you finish high school, Jimmy?  No.  No, I didn't either.  Almost, but what happened...  Wait, you didn't finish high school either?  No, I was doing really well.  I was with a D average.  And you know how it is when you slip on a razor and you wind up in rehab? 
[00:28:00]  You know, you have to drop out.  A little hard to go back to school.  Yeah.  Your little slit wrists.  A little bandage wrists.  My wrists are surrendering.  LOL.  I kind of remember a chick, though, in high school that tried to slit her wrists and she  came in with bandages on her wrists and like everybody thought she was kind of cool and  wacky and easy to have sex with because of it.  I came back a month later and I just was too far gone.  Really?  It was just nothing?  Like May. 
[00:28:30]  God, what a great way to get out of homework, man.  Yeah.  Just slit your wrists, kids.  I didn't even deal with where it was just I didn't like school.  Didn't like going.  I was doing okay up until I met my first marijuana cigarette.  Then it was all downhill from there because I'd rather just get high.  And I stopped going to gym class.  And a lot of the reason I didn't graduate was because I didn't have gym credits.  Jesus. 
[00:29:00]  Gym credits.  I had my social studies and my mathematics, but because of gym, I couldn't graduate.  And the dean said, well, come back next year.  You know, maybe you need a little time away.  You're doing nothing around here and the rest of the year is a wash.  Why don't you go out and get a taste of reality and then you come back?  And he expected I'd come running back and, oh, I don't want to be out there in the working  world and, you know, give me another year here.  After a year of being on my own and, you know, making money and not having to go to school 
[00:29:30]  and no homework and stuff, I really didn't come back.  That strategy backfired.  Do you now drive by the dean's house in your limo and wave?  That's what I do, Opie.  I limo past him.  I think he's senile in a wheelchair now.  What was his name?  Pete Polina.  It was Pete Polina at John Glenn High School out there on Long Island.  And, yeah, he told me not to come back.  Did you just toot your horn as you drive by his...  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  As you drive by his residence.  Pistol Pete Polina, they called him.  Thanks for the advice, buddy. 
[00:30:00]  It worked out fine for me.  Thank you.  Did you get married on TV and then have him apologize to you in front of the whole nation?  We were wrong about you, Anthony.  We were wrong.  You were right, Anthony.  Mom!  I knocked it over and I have to do this now.  I love that part of the movie.  Do you know who this is?  No.  Who is it?  Who are you bringing in?  This is your old high school principal.  Is that amazing how insightful that is into the psychosis of a person? 
[00:30:30]  Like, we all want to be apologized to publicly, for Christ's sake.  Can somebody just admit that I'm a something?  Somebody from the past?  Somebody?  Oh, that scene is great.  King of comedy.  They bring the principal out in his delusional mind.  We apologize.  I was wrong.  That's what I need.  And you were right.  And you were right.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes? 
[00:31:00]  That's what I need.  I need pistol people, Lena, to apologize to me.  Anthony, you were right leaving.  I was wrong.  You're a professor.  You seem to be well-educated.  You're doing well in life.  I was...  We were all wrong, Anthony.  Oh, God.  Let's...  Oh, God.  Let's go to Missouri.  Maniac, what's up?  Hey, I was just curious. 
[00:31:30]  I think I just heard Jim say O-L-O instead of L-O-L.  Ha, ha, ha.  I think I said...  L-O-L.  He's busting on the mare's chops there, so I just thought...  I just barely caught that.  I wasn't sure.  I think I said L-O-L.  If I didn't, well, I'll eat crow.  All right.  These guys are just listening and waiting to pounce.  I know.  That's right.  Those are mispronounced something.  They're all over you.  Ed in Oklahoma.  What's up, Ed?  Hey, man, when did Voss run for mare?  I love that Oklahoma gets the best, Voss. 
[00:32:00]  He's a turd.  Yes, he is.  I'd love to have me, Emilio, and Steve talking.  I don't really think I...  One with perfect diction.  The other one just stumbling over his fat tongue.  Let's get back to these clips from the mayor of Boston.  You go to any neighborhood of Boston, there's oddest living space.  Oddest lofts.  There's so many parts of this, the architectural, the media part. 
[00:32:30]  What?  He's gross to listen to.  Isn't it disgusting?  He's gross to listen to.  I believe he was trying to say how diverse Boston is.  Yeah, but it sounded like he was going to say colored.  We've got the colored living over there in this corner.  And we've got the Jews we keep over here.  It's like the libertarian.  Boston is not diverse.  Mumble.  They all have their sections.  Oh, their sections.  Listen again.  It sounds like you want to say the colored or something colored. 
[00:33:00]  You go to any neighborhood of Boston, there's oddest living space.  Oddest lofts.  There's so many parts of this, the architectural, the media part.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute, dude.  You're on to something.  There's the colored that are over here.  All right.  He was talking about, you know.  There's so many parts.  Parts.  And then he says the color.  The color.  What other word could that be?  Because I wouldn't put it past him to have that slip out anyway.  Well, it is Boston. 
[00:33:30]  Let me hear that again.  What other word could he have been trying to say here?  You go to any neighborhood of Boston, there's oddest living space.  Oddest lofts.  There's so many parts of this, the architectural, the media part.  The color.  The color.  Is he trying to say what he's trying to say?  Is he trying to say condominium?  The colored.  We keep the colored over here.  It's our test.  Wow, man.  Listen to this next one. 
[00:34:00]  This is how we will continue to grow the city's job base.  By being proactive, strategic, smart, and aggressive.  How we'll continue to grow the...  By being, babying.  Didn't he say like he said babying?  Instead of saying by being proactive, he said babying.  And not this is how we're going to...  Listen to the beginning again.  This is how we will continue to grow the city's job base. 
[00:34:30]  By being proactive, strategic, smart, and aggressive.  Smart.  To grow the city's job base.  Isn't that how you would say that?  Let's go to Hex in Rhode Island.  He's a retard.  What's up, Hex?  Wow.  I can't believe this.  How did you guys get fired for making fun of him, for pretending that this guy was dead?  He's already dead in office.  Yeah, I don't know how...  Idiot.  Maybe he didn't even want us fired.  He personally got us fired.  No, he was the one that personally got us fired. 
[00:35:00]  Let's see.  Oh my God, listen to this next one.  He's reading to the school kids here.  Dear Farmer Brown, the barn is very cold at night.  The barn...  The barn...  He's reading to children, right?  Is that what he's doing there?  Like they're going to the schools?  The beyond...  The beyond...  The beyond...  The beyond...  Oh my goodness. 
[00:35:30]  What a retard.  I feel secure with my speaking ability today.  Dear Farmer Brown, the beyond...  The beyond...  The barn is very cold at night.  The beyond...  He flubbed barn reading it.  Barn!  And he's reading it.  But I also say, anyone who does this work, it's not for money.  I don't do it for money. 
[00:36:00]  Let me tell you that, my friend.  You know, I see my friends and what they're doing in life.  I say, my God.  You know, I grew up in the streets of Hyde Park.  My father wasn't...  My father worked in a factory, so I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  Isn't it born with a silver spoon in your mouth?  Yes.  I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  It was born with a ladle in his mouth, and he still has it in there.  What a muttering, stuttering ass. 
[00:36:30]  That is wasn't born with a golden spoon.  This is the mayor.  The mayor.  This guy has been the mayor of Boston for years and years and years.  They will not throw this guy out of office.  That is some city up there, man.  Boston is a minority, majority city.  A minority, majority city. 
[00:37:00]  What could that possibly mean?  That the majority of the people are minority?  What?  That could mean that, but I don't think that's accurate.  I don't think it's accurate either.  That's the whitest city in America.  No, they know where to keep their ethnic people.  They keep them out of the really popular areas,  so when you walk around, you see mostly white people.  That's what it is. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe it'll catch on around the country.  Reagan believes the buck stops here.  Those of us, while leaders, live by the principle as well.  By the principle.  First of all, Reagan is not the one who said the buck stops here.  No.  FDR.  Am I wrong with that?  I think you're wrong.  Of course.  But it wasn't Reagan.  I'm half right.  It was Harry S. Truman.  Right.  It was FDR.  Of course it was Harry S. Truman, Jimmy.  Harry S. Truman.  Jesus. 
[00:38:00]  But I was right about it.  Buck stops here.  I'll accept responsibility for that.  I'll use it as an example.  It's my fault.  We all knew it.  That's why.  What's wrong with you?  FDR.  That's all I am.  It's like Jimmy Carter said,  speak softly and put your dick in an intern's mouth.  Let's go to Ass Water in Connecticut.  Ass Water.  Ass Water.  I love that one.  Ass Water.  Yeah.  How many Starbuckses do you think he stops by every day?  I think the mayor stops by at least six Starbuckses. 
[00:38:30]  Starbuckses.  Somebody photoshopped it on the live track.  I saw that.  I saw the photoshop.  Later, boys.  It says Starbuckses with the logo.  I just feel better about my speaking abilities today, though.  I feel we need more Starbuckses.  All right.  Let's go to this one.  Well, if there's 9-1-1.  If there is something suspicious out there, call 9-1-1.  That's the emergency line in the city of Boston. 
[00:39:00]  That's all that one is?  All right.  That was no big deal.  No.  All right.  A little over-explaining what 9-1-1 is.  Yeah.  I think that's what they were going for there.  It's a unique thing.  Emergency number in Boston.  And finally.  Don't try to use it in another city.  FDR said.  Close enough, though, you know.  I don't know.  It wasn't like you said Ford.  I wanted Anthony to impress, though.  I know.  We're all just sitting here hoping to impress Anthony. 
[00:39:30]  What a good presidential quote.  You had the Johnson one.  I'd have this one.  I can't believe two presidential quotes came up in one show today.  That's pretty cool.  Deep throat thing.  Yeah.  Good news.  Back yesterday.  Yes.  Deep throat.  Deep throat.  Deep throat wants coffee.  I told Anthony he looks like Lloyd Bridges.  He does.  All right.  It's like I picked a bad day to stop sniffing glue.  Yeah.  He definitely, you know, doesn't. 
[00:40:00]  I was reading some of this story, and he used to be like a silver-haired ex-Nazi hunter.  And now look at him.  He's just, I think I wet myself.  Oh.  We say it all the time on this show.  Time is a bitch.  Deep diapers.  Deep diapers.  You know, I asked for a paper, like the post, to look at it.  Yeah.  And I didn't realize.  Like, why is Deep throat out on the cover? 
[00:40:30]  That's because they handed me May 19th.  You have the May 19th paper.  Thursday, May 19th.  That's great.  And Eric is just sitting here laughing instead of helping you out.  He thinks it's just hilarious.  Get him a fucking post.  Yes, sir.  Please.  Please.  Eric's laughing his ass off, and I think it's his responsibility to make sure the studio is set up.  I don't mind the paper occasionally.  It's off by 12 days.  12?  Well, that's got to stay there so Sweetie can read it, because it's a thought starter. 
[00:41:00]  Give him that paper over there, the one that says, Lindy made it.  I don't want to do any more presidential on time.  I'm right.  All right.  Hold that one over your head.  The one that says, Dewey defeats Truman.  Oh, wow.  Here we go.  Dave from Boston knows what the mayor was saying about the coloreds.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  This should be enlightening.  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Deeks?  What's up?  Hey, listen.  He's talking about all the oddest Boston crap like that up in Boston. 
[00:41:30]  And when he's saying colored, I think he meant to say all the colored buildings.  Colored buildings?  Or culture?  Is that where they live?  College.  Roxbury.  College.  All right.  Cauliflower.  That's right.  Those buildings are all green with black seeds on them.  All right.  All right.  We have one more clip for today.  Aw.  We'll go to this bit from time to time, but I'm sure.  One more clip from the mayor of Boston.  We all know that's completely a major project like this takes real teamwork. 
[00:42:00]  So let's start by thanking our federal and state partners along with our congressional delegation for standing by us.  Delegration.  Oh, good.  I thought I was hoping for a good one.  I thought they just played that for his little stumble at the beginning, but the delegation.  Ah, federal delegation.  What a maroon.  There you go, Boston.  There's your mayor.  That's your mayor, Boston. 
[00:42:30]  Have fun.  Great.  You got yourself, well, they got themselves a championship baseball team.  That's all that really counts when you think about it.  And football.  Yes, Ben.  Thank you for reminding me of that, Ben.  Of course.  Let's go to Timmy.  Hey, Timmy.  What's up?  Hey, man.  And I was wondering, you got the clip of him saying, I want to go home?  I want to go home.  That's great.  All right.  There's your mayor.  That's okay.  The cops shoot, they kill students with beanbag guns. 
[00:43:00]  But, you know, you got your mayor for life.  Life mayor.  Why don't we take our first break, Anthony?  We have lots to do today, by the way.  Bob Kelly is coming in studio in about 15 or 20 minutes.  We're going to play the audio from yesterday.  You left to go move.  I know.  And then Ant and I went off on this, I don't know, hour tangent about dumb shit instead  of playing the audio.  So now we get to play it today with you in studio.  I have to admit, I'm secretly happy.  Of course you were. 
[00:43:30]  I'm secretly happy.  So we'll definitely get to that as soon as Bob gets here.  We won't delay on that at all.  Bill from Waterford, New York, is asking, if you call up Deep Throat now, does he answer,  who is this?  There's been a break in.  Where?  Where?  The Watergate Hotel.  You're kidding.  Oh, no.  How did it happen?  Well, you know, Lydia was involved and the plumbers and they broke in and they were trying  to steal secrets. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, no.  Where?  Watergate Hotel.  Jim and I were talking yesterday.  That's one of our favorite things on the show now.  Oh, boy.  I don't believe this.  Nixon was involved.  I was just talking to him.  Oh, no.  Makes me happy.  Who is this?  Who is this?  Who is this? 
[00:44:30]  Who is involved in that break-in?  The plumbers.  They called the plumbers to plug up the leaks.  And Liddy.  I had nothing to do with this.  Oh, Liddy.  There he is.  It's Liddy.  G-Yogurt Liddy.  There are posts about Liddy on Whack.  Liddy, what do you think of Deep Throat revealing himself?  Oh, you know.  Oh, you know.  That's all you get out of Liddy.  That's all you ever get out of Liddy. 
[00:45:00]  Well, it looks like he doesn't have much of a brain, so I don't expect much from him.  Liddy's throat is pretty shallow.  Isn't that a good little comparison?  There's Deep Throat.  But Liddy, he doesn't really have a throat, Liddy.  How do you eat?  Well, I know.  It's not a lot of tough things.  Well, Liddy, you stink.  Liddy can be the worst character on our show.  He's a great character.  It's awful. 
[00:45:30]  FDR.  Liddy's the worst.  All right, we got someone pissed off at us.  Teresa, what's wrong?  I am so tired of trying to get through to you guys, and every fucking time a little peon says,  okay, thank you, bye.  Okay, thank you, bye.  Oh, Teresa.  What the fuck do you think you got women listeners out here?  I'm in Texas.  I got a girl online that we don't even know to your website, but we both love you.  She's in California named Star, you know, and I swear I've called you at least 15. 
[00:46:00]  Anyway, Anthony, imagine how pissed she is.  Imagine how pissed she's going to be when she stops yapping and waits for an answer and  realizes she's been hung up on.  And I think, hello, hello, motherfucker.  That was her chance to say something.  She finally got through.  You are just evil with that cursor.  I don't know.  I see it hovering over the hang-up button and then click.  All right, why don't we take our first break? 
[00:46:30]  We got lots to do, I'm telling you.  Neil Armstrong wants his hair back.  We got, well, that's the tease.  That's what people out there are saying.  What?  I can't go to the Deep Tracks channel.  I got to find out what that's about.  Right.  And then we got the Florida Taser story, which is really funny.  There's a couple of cute little stories in the news, too.  They're helping out the mermaid baby.  Have you seen that story?  Aw, that's so cute.  Isn't that an endearing little thing for a child? 
[00:47:00]  The mermaid baby.  Dude, have you seen this?  I love when they give these cute little names to freaks of nature that should just be shot  in the head and buried out back.  I buried the little feller.  Poor little mermaid.  Poor little...  What kind of box do you put her in?  Are we getting the stripper surprise story?  I put her in your shoebox.  No, I mean, we're getting the audio because they got the interview.  Oh, cool.  We'll do that, too.  Poor little feller.  Poor little feller.  Oh, you haven't seen the mermaid baby? 
[00:47:30]  No, I guess we're not breaking because I have to find out now.  It's the baby that the legs are connected from, I guess, the snatch all the way down to the ankles.  You got two leg bones, but everything else is fused together.  What is this in a real paper?  I swear to you.  Yeah, he's right.  Did it say AP?  No.  It's right there on...  Look.  Uh-oh.  On 1010wins.com. 
[00:48:00]  So you know it's true.  It has to be real.  It's funny you said all the way from her snatch.  Well, that's how I have to describe it.  But it's like, you know, they give these cute little names.  Mermaid Baby.  Oh, my gosh!  Little Ariel.  Holy crap!  That can't be real.  Kid with water on the brain.  Oh, look.  It's little Pez dispenser kid, we call him.  You know, you got to give cute names to him.  All right.  So-called mermaid baby undergoes operation. 
[00:48:30]  Peruvian.  Peruvian surgeons.  We're going to cure the little kid with elephantitis of the ball sack.  But we call him hippity-hop balls.  No, we're going to give him glasses and make him a producer.  Muss his hair up a bit.  Give him 20,000 cups of coffee.  So they have to, like, slit her legs up.  That was the operation they did?  And, yeah, they say that she's got 15 years of surgery to go. 
[00:49:00]  What?  They have to.  Yeah, because the bones get fused, and everything gets, like, fused together.  So they got to slit her, and then as she grows, I guess they got to do things to her leg bones.  That's all cute, but let's get really into this.  Are they going to make her a vag?  Are they going to slit her a slit?  How about an answer to some of the questions that we don't know about that they never give?  Right.  Is it fused all the way up to her snatch? 
[00:49:30]  It has to be, or she would be bloated by now.  And now, what do you do?  Do you build her a new one?  Is that, like, inside her thighs right now?  And you've got to cut it and then build one?  And who decides how tight it's going to be?  The doc.  How big the lips are.  All right.  Jesus, Jimmy.  So you can't put these on.  They'll see them through panties.  I know.  I want you to model them after these bratwursts. 
[00:50:00]  Slap these together and take a look.  That's what we need.  Two bratwursts with a grape on them.  I want you to use Abner Louima's lips.  Just slap them in there.  Oh, Christ.  Yeah, they had a girl on one of the talk shows yesterday.  Who had had the surgery done years ago.  And she's, you know, her legs look really weird. 
[00:50:30]  Like her thighs were really skinny.  But her calves were really fat.  Ah, good, good, good, good, good.  She had, like, the Popeye thing going on.  But I guess, you know, it's better than having to go through life as the mermaid person.  Not much of a mermaid look to it, though.  The mermaids are hot.  The best freak baby ever, though.  We did, like, three hours on it.  Baby without a face?  No.  Baby without a face?  No.  Jimmy, anyone else want to guess? 
[00:51:00]  Faceless baby was the worst thing to look at.  That thing was popular a few months back.  And everyone was emailing it around.  And you click on the picture and just, it's baby without a face.  And the father is holding it up, like, nuzzling.  This just chopped meat, pile of chopped meat in the front.  Oh, God, that was awful.  There it is, Opie.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Okay, it's a tax.  I don't see any ass.  I don't see no ass.  Where does it crap?  Wow, that's got, wow.  Does it crap out of a little hole like a fish where that brown string just comes out? 
[00:51:30]  I think it's all collecting in the little baby's thighs.  Look at that.  That's all, that's all, like.  Do you see ass?  No, no ass.  There's no ass crack or nothing.  No.  It's fused all the way from the hips down.  Oh, wait, no, no.  It's just an Asian baby.  Go to the next one.  Oh, it's sideways.  I didn't look.  Well, let's go to Tony the trucker.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  We're having a good time.  Hey, yeah, y'all just touched on that.  I was just going to mention that show that was on TV about that mermaid baby. 
[00:52:00]  They had that older girl, I guess, that had gone through the operation.  But, yeah, that was pretty messed up, man.  It had some fucked up looking legs.  But y'all already touched on it, so I'll just punch out and listen.  All right, thanks, Tony.  Let's go to Free Rider.  Free Rider, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  The urinary tract and the genitalia and all that stuff is fused together as well.  So they have to construct their own genitalia.  So how does the baby get rid of any waste? 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  The reason she's been waiting so long is she's had so many urinary tract infections  that they've had to wait to kind of fix it, make sure all the infections go down first.  Well, how's this stuff getting out of her?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Maybe they put a bag on her or something.  I'm going three days without any movements, and I look like a bloated Ethiopian kid.  And I can't imagine that she's going a lot longer than me.  They squeeze her like toothpaste, and it comes out this little slit in her ankles. 
[00:53:00]  All right, punch her out.  All right.  Anyway.  She blasts one here down by her feet.  Because her feet aren't fused together.  So there's like, it looked to be some type of opening by her ankles.  No, that can't be.  Take a look at the picture.  No, I know.  There's a little hole in the back that just trickles out of.  You think?  There's got to be some little clumsy, messy back legs.  Where do you get pampers with just one hole for the leg? 
[00:53:30]  One big hole.  A pamper.  A pamper.  Why can't they address that?  You know what I mean?  We want to know.  What's going on there?  We want to know.  Anytime there's some kind of medical malfunction like this, they never answer the things you  really want answered.  You see Siamese twins that are connected from the hip up, where they share everything from  the hips down.  I want to know how they deal with having sex and stuff.  They have two different brains.  All right, there you go.  You finally figured out the craziest freakish baby ever. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  The two-headed twins are, I don't even know what, I don't know if they're officially twins.  With the crab, they look like a crab.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, those were the brothers in Chicago.  The brothers were connected at the hip and their torso, but they had four legs.  Right.  And four arms.  Right.  So they're two different people up top.  They fuse into one person, and then right at the hips, they come back into two people.  Right.  So they had four legs, and they showed them playing baseball. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  And they were running, and it looked like some freakish crab running down the baseline.  Frightening.  The best part was the one brother would hit, and the other brother would catch.  Yeah, he was the catcher for the team, while the other brother hit.  And the guy was out every time.  Oh, you silly goose, you're out again.  You just have to throw it to the brother.  He's right there to make the tag.  Right.  The brother, throw it to me.  I'm on him.  And of course, the dumb announcers have to say stuff like, you could be whatever you want. 
[00:55:00]  You could play ball.  My dream is to play for the Chicago Cubs.  Yeah.  Really.  Sure it is.  Jesus.  They're going to put some freakish crab man, two-headed crab man on the team.  You know what, though?  Sell tickets.  I was going to say, attendance would go way up.  Mm-hmm.  Mr. What was his name there?  Vek?  Yeah.  He knew.  He knew.  That guy knew.  Freakish.  What is that you're showing me, Eric?  That's another picture of the baby.  The baby's cute, though. 
[00:55:30]  Cute little baby.  Anthony, anyway.  What?  A little Malagros.  Let's see.  Weighs 14 pounds.  Measures 25 inches long.  About the size and weight of a normal six-month-old baby.  Um, but, uh, Malagros has suffered frequent urinary infections because, hold on, kids, her  urinary tract, anus, and genitals end in the same opening, almost like a sewer. 
[00:56:00]  It says it right here.  Almost like a sewer.  So, is it like a bird?  Like, birds have, like, one thing just come out of liquid and solid.  Yeah, when it hits your car, it's just shit and piss.  Right.  It's all over your windshield.  Yeah, it's probably the same thing.  This whole, yuck, just comes out.  In the last three months, doctors inserted a silicone bag filled with saline to stretch  the skin so it would be able to cover her legs once they're cut apart.  She also has a deformed left kidney.  Very small right one. 
[00:56:30]  Located very low in her body.  What happened here?  I don't know.  If this mother didn't deserve a push down the old staircase, the old hacienda.  Wow.  Let's go to Ken in Jacksonville.  Ken, what's up?  Just bouncing off the paracotta tile floor.  They figured out since the baby can't shit, they nicknamed it Old Gravy Baby.  Punch it out, boys.  That's almost really funny.  Old Gravy Back.  Old Gravy Back. 
[00:57:00]  Old Gravy Leg.  Wow.  All right.  So it's called mermaid syndrome, huh?  Yeah, they have to give it cute names.  Condition occurs in one out of every 70,000 births.  One in 70,000?  That sounds kind of common.  And there are only three known cases of children with the affliction alive in the world today.  They probably die right away.  Something tells me that isn't the only affliction.  Well, Anthony, yes, the deformity is almost always fatal within days of delivery due to serious defects to vital organs. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  But Milagros, whose name means miracles in Spanish, has survived.  Of course it does.  Yeah, that's a real miracle.  Thank you, Lord.  Deliver that mess.  I saw a lady in the comedy cellar probably about a month ago upstairs in the restaurant.  She was the most awful looking person I've ever seen.  Really?  She had, it looked like, she looked like a scream mask. 
[00:58:00]  Her mouth looked like it was three or four inches, maybe two inches wide with buck teeth.  And it looked like someone had taken her face and stretched it like taffy and then caved it in.  It was like a half a parenthesis almost.  It was, her chin might have been an inch wide.  I'm like, how did she make it to adulthood?  And who was her friend out with her pretending that, yeah, it's nice to just have coffee with you and look at that awful face.  Holy Jesus.  I couldn't even laugh at her. 
[00:58:30]  At the comedy club?  Dude, I couldn't, it was upstairs at the restaurant.  I couldn't even elbow a comic and go look at that.  There is something so heinous out there that you can't, yeah, you can't laugh.  I can't even look sometimes.  It's really horrible when you, and they sometimes get you by surprise.  You're just wheeling your shopping cart at the supermarket and you're turned down an aisle and you're staring horror right in the face.  It's like, oh my god, what happened?  Teeth that are sticking straight out at you?  What?  What happened? 
[00:59:00]  I really want to take this one home and bang her.  Just out of mercy.  Put it in that awful mouth?  Yeah, we'll just caress that bent face and little tiny chin.  Caress old tiny chin.  And when she gets you a little tear in her eye because somebody is finally holding her the way she wants to be held.  Oh no.  You drill your fist into her face and go, now get out, ugly.  Oh, you're horrible.  You're just not nice.  Oh my god. 
[00:59:30]  Let's go to Dave in Detroit.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing today, guys?  We're having a lot of fun today.  Hey, no doubt.  I used to be a rehabilitation counselor, how people get jobs.  So you need to get all the specs on these people, what their problems was.  So I had this report coming on this guy that he had a job where he had to be right next to the toilet all the time.  So when he came to my office, I asked him why.  He said, well, I was born without an asshole.  And essentially, instead of having a colostomy, his dad had a doctor's drill in there.  So he had no way of controlling his shit.  It just would go whenever because he had no muscles there. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, he had no, like, sphincter or anything that, you know, keeps you from just crapping when you have crap there?  You could just fall out.  So what, he would go to the bathroom when he just felt like he was coming on?  Whenever he couldn't control it.  So he basically had to be able to work.  He could run right to the toilet at that point.  The guy also refused to wear any type of diaper as well.  It's pretty bad.  Are we ready to call shenanigans on this guy?  That sounds a little odd.  I would think there would be a colostomy bag on that guy.  And he hung up. 
[01:00:30]  And he hung up.  Yeah.  All right.  What is Parasite Head all about?  Parasite Head?  AJ in Delaware.  That doesn't sound like an endearing, fun little name for a child.  Go ahead.  Yeah, the other day on, I think it was on Oprah or some nonsense, they had a baby with a parasitic head.  It had an additional head, but no body attached to it.  Oh, I saw that.  It was like half the Siamese twins.  Freakish.  It was like almost half a head growing out of the other head.  Like that character in South Park?  Yeah, yeah.  Where it had, like, conjoined twin head. 
[01:01:00]  And the eyes kind of tried to open every once in a while?  Dude, the eyes, yeah, the eyes were open.  And the mouth and nose would twitch and it would move.  But it couldn't talk or anything?  No.  I wonder if there was a brain in there going, ah, this blows.  It was just retarded.  Big retard head.  Oh, and it had a little thin mustache and couldn't get food orders right.  Oh, no, I didn't know you wanted flavored oatmeal.  I wanted to take that piping hot plastic cup of oatmeal and throw it in his dumb face yesterday. 
[01:01:30]  I'm like, give me some oatmeal, maybe some cinnamon or something.  He brings back plain oatmeal.  It was like a melted brain.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  No, I'm sorry.  Ricky.  Oh, boy, was I tired of that.  He will be remembered as probably one of the worst interns ever.  People.  We can't remember him yet because he forgot to bring his paperwork in, so he has to come back.  Of course.  Are you shitting me?  Of course.  When?  Today or tomorrow.  I thought we were done.  I want to see him.  Tell him to come in at like noon. 
[01:02:00]  Noon.  I'll miss him.  Oh.  All right.  No, it didn't look like music for you.  So that was on Oprah?  The head was just sticking out?  I didn't know if it was on Oprah.  I saw it online.  Anyway, the freakish, the best one ever was the two little girls, two heads on one body.  Oh, yeah.  One complete body.  I think 20, 20 or 60 Minutes, one of them did a whole piece on them.  We talked about them for hours.  Had wider shoulders than a normal person.  Right.  And had two heads on one body. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  They had everything.  Besides the two heads, yeah.  Oh, another bus beating.  Hold on.  Another bus beating.  Or is that the same one?  I love bus beatings.  Why would you do that with the camera rolling?  The kids taking pictures.  Oh, nice.  Right.  God, every day it's great.  Every day you get the video of the day and the crash of the day.  Why does it always seem to be ethnic?  A bus full of ethnic people.  What is that?  I couldn't tell.  It all blurted out.  I can't like it.  Do we have the other bus beating? 
[01:03:00]  We never played that.  Strapping Ecuadorian driver with shorts and that awful, like, almost three-quarter long-sleeved  shirt to his elbows.  I got it.  Yeah, we have a bus fight audio.  Yeah.  Well, I want to talk about the two-headed girls, but...  Well, are they both thinking separate, like, heads?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, they were totally there.  Had, yeah, complete brain function and did what normal girls do.  Oof.  And the only difference besides the two heads, like Anne said, they had broader shoulders. 
[01:03:30]  But everything else went down to a V and they had two legs, two arms, and they swam.  And now, you know...  The creepiest scene ever, they showed him on a bike, just riding a bike with two heads,  like, woo!  We're having fun.  That was really weird.  What do you do?  And that night...  Yeah, that's what we were saying.  It's like, can you imagine one girl is like, you know, like, wants to save herself for marriage  and the other girl's a slut?  Or how about they both fall in love with two different people and get married? 
[01:04:00]  And what do you do?  How do the guys handle it?  Right.  You're sharing a snatch.  You're sharing the snatch.  You're kissing one of the heads.  You're playing with one tit.  And then the other guy is sleeping right next to you because he's married to her.  And then you climb aboard, do your stuff.  What are they, flip a coin?  You're involved.  And then when the one you're banging dozes off, do you go to the other one?  Psst.  Just suck it. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, you're like, as you're banging, do you turn to the other head and go, I'm fucking  you now.  You just let her know.  Like, hey, hey, no, you're not.  Yeah, I'm fucking you now.  It doesn't make any sense.  Those are the questions you need.  One on your balls, one on the helmet.  There's a lot of stuff you can do with that.  Date that creature in a second.  Two mouths, no way to creature.  Take that creature.  How come I always have to eat the ass first? 
[01:05:00]  Hush, hush, now.  Flip her over, stare in the back of two heads in the pillow.  One's going, ooh, and one's going, ouch, ouch, I don't like this.  Take it all.  Those are the questions.  That's the questions.  You need answers, too.  Those are the questions.  You're right.  Glenn on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Hey.  Sweet tits.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I got this guy by my house.  He looks like the elephant man. 
[01:05:30]  He's got his freaking eyes all out of place.  He's got part of his brain hanging out.  And I'm telling you, I'm right on my bicycle with my daughter.  He sees this guy.  She starts screaming.  He's freaking unbelievable, man.  He's fucking scary as anything.  Did he get shot?  I didn't get shot.  No, did he get shot?  I mean, why is his head all messed up?  I have no idea.  He just looks like one of these circus freaks.  Oh, wow.  You know, and I keep walking around with the digital camera waiting for him to come out again. 
[01:06:00]  He walks around in, like, a hospital uniform, you know, like he's an outpatient or something.  He's really, really free.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  Let's go to George in Jersey.  George?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Wasn't one of those heads a country singer?  Oh, that's the other.  That was sick.  Talk about exploitation.  That was the other one where, uh, oh, my God.  They used to wheel the one short one around on, like, a tray down the street. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  It was, like, the other side of the other one.  Thank you, sir.  I think this segment's over.  Holy shit.  Take it out, boys.  What the hell is...  We have, uh...  Do we get to take pictures of these girls so we can share with our listeners?  Those girls are naked?  Those girls are completely naked with, like, uh, that body paint on them.  They're wearing thaw underpants.  Oh, is that what it is?  But they're topless and it looks like they're wearing, like, uh, like, business suits or something.  Oh, my God. 
[01:07:00]  Shirt and tie.  Shirt and tie.  Shirt and tie.  They've got, like, suspenders, belts.  Oh, my God.  White shirts.  Little ties.  Wow.  They've just painted on them.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  They're lovely.  I don't remember what we were talking about, but, uh, we're going to take a break.  All right.  And we'll get the girls in that are completely naked outside the studio.  They have body paint on.  Well, what were we talking about, anyway?  What?  Huh?  Oh, is that what they're dressed as?  What?  That's what they're dressed as.  Reservoir Dogs.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Very nice. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, Mr. Pink.  As opposed to good?  I wish Jay was here.  As opposed to good?  I can't even think of Harvey Keitel anymore.  It's all stupid Jay doing Keitel.  It's all I can think of.  Kit Kat Club.  Smokes of grass.  I left.  I got that for a month.  Smokes of grass.  Kit Kat Club.  Kit Kat Club.  Yeah, that's funny stuff, Jay.  All right.  We're going to try one more before we go to break.  Oh, no.  He hung up.  Oh, what about Jerry?  He hung up.  Oh.  Jerry.  What, sweetie?  What?  Tell me.  Jerry.  Yo.  Jerry. 
[01:08:00]  It's my pride and joy.  Jerry, what's up, man?  How are you doing today?  Hey, yeah.  Mikey was born with something called  a hypospadia or something like that.  A what?  A hypospadia.  And what is that?  It's where your penis is split from the tip to the base when he's born.  Oh.  So what do you do?  It is, first off, very disturbing when he came out.  You're looking at it and you're like,  there's something wrong here, Doc.  And he's like, yeah.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:08:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Wait, so it's split like a wound or it's healed?  It's healed, but it looks really like if you take a bra first and you cut it in half.  And it kind of curls?  Yeah.  Kind of curls away from itself?  Yes, it does.  It's really disturbing.  Oh, and what do they do?  They're going to have surgery at the end of this month to get it fixed.  Do they have one little urethra?  Does he, like, urinate out of one side of it? 
[01:09:00]  Actually, the hole that you pee out of his urethra is down.  So when he pees, he pees down.  Oh, I thought you're constantly cleaning off the wall.  No, no, no, no.  This pees, it's really disturbing.  White men speaking with four cuck.  You get douche chills, that's all.  Well, is it a big one?  Um, no, not really.  You really can't tell because it's in two pieces.  So has the doctor, like, shown you pictures of what this looks like after they fix it?  Um, if they haven't told me how they're going to fix it, 
[01:09:30]  then I really don't want to know how they're going to fix it  because it's just a little bit too, ugh.  Like I said, whatever you start talking about it,  you're getting up to put those nice chills down your back.  Holy jeez, what kind of drugs did you or your wife do?  None, that's the worst thing.  And they couldn't see that in, like, a sonogram?  No, they didn't see nothing like that until it was, uh, too late.  Holy mother of God.  Well, it's not exactly what you're expecting.  Can he get a rod?  I don't know.  Test it out.  He's not that far. 
[01:10:00]  He's only five months old, so.  Jesus.  Well, no, without being dirty or anything, kids are known to get rods.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, but, you know, like I say, I'm just disturbing.  I'm sorry.  We've got to take a break because these girls only have a limited time.  And I'll put you out, guys.  Later.  So we're going to take a quick break, and we'll get to the girls that are, uh, naked.  Why are they in a rush?  Because they're promoting all over the city today.  That's great.  This is a real big deal.  They're going on a bus.  They're going on, like, a voyeur bus.

No, not  My hemorrhoid or my twatel  The other thing, yeah  Because you got it  Ladies  It's nothing bad 
[01:24:30]  It's just kind of odd  And they're women  See, we don't have that many women in the studio  It's more good odds  Maybe a girl  Let me tell you  I feel more  Maybe a girl could be a better judge  As to what it is  I feel more comfortable with men  Going naked  I hate women  I'm in the steam room  I always cover up  Show them  All right  We're topless  What do you think  Oh, you're topless  Girls, what do you think this is?  I don't know  I don't even know  What is that?  Wait, you got to show her  What is it?  It's not bad  It's not bad  But the guys, no  Don't touch it  Oh, my God  Show the guy from the post  Is it a penis in an Audi?  It's a big one  Wait, Sandy, Bob can't see it 
[01:25:00]  I don't want to see it, dude  I don't want to see it, please  Don't do it to me  Look at it  For the love of God, don't do it  Look at it, Bob  No  No  No  No  No, Sandy, Sandy  Is it a penis?  Dude, what is that?  Do you know?  Cut it off  Cut it off  Wait, I'm going to be on the shelf  If I cut it off  That's why I'm here  Get on mic  Wait, she's really shocked  Mrs. Pink is really  Stupid  Bob had to leave 
[01:25:30]  What is it?  You know how  I don't know  Truthfully, one day  It was there  I thought maybe  For all my sins  Let me explain what's going on  These girls are so hot  Bob was enjoying himself  We forced him out of the studio  He is left to go puke  Sandy Kane just showed  Twatto to the fine  Topless girls  And they all have a comment  Mrs. Pink  Cut it off  Cut it off  That's a good suggestion  Then I'll never do the show again  What does it look like?  Keep it  What does it look like, ladies?  A used to be penis 
[01:26:00]  Somehow  It's growing  It's coming back  Yeah  I really don't know  It looks like a lot of gum  Yeah, a lot of gum  You chewed up a whole big pack  Of Hubba Bubba  And then  You know what?  My one comment is just  Wow  That's very interesting  Work it  I say work it  You got it?  You got to use what you got  You ever see the movie  Total Recall  With Arnold Schwarzenegger  Who Goes to Mars  Remember the character  Quatto  It was like  A little creature 
[01:26:30]  That came out of a guy  And it was living  That's why we call that  Twatto  Because it's like  A whole other entity  That's growing out of her twat  So we call it Twatto  It has a name  So where did it come from?  It just showed up  She says one day  She was shaving  Years and years and years ago  Back in I guess  The 30s  Before film  Before film  Before film  And she was shaving  And cut herself  And then after that  This thing grew  Out of where she cut herself  I get you  Maybe it's HPV gone mad 
[01:27:00]  You think?  I think you're right  Yeah  Genital warts  Maybe it just grew  And grew and grew  I don't know  Yeah well that's what  A doctor said  On our show once  I think  Unless you were shaving  With an old tuna lid  From a gutter  I can't see  Why that would grow  They had five doctors  On with  They said it was cancer  No they said  It was a genital wart  And you also have  She has a hemorrhoid  In the back too  She likes showing people  But we'll spare you that one  Excuse man  We'll spare you that one  That is a cute  I saw that one  Ladies would you like  To see the hemorrhoid?  No  No  I didn't eat Mexican food 
[01:27:30]  So it might not be out  It's only out sometimes  Oh  Well that is beyond  Is that always out though?

You know, what's so funny is I forgot  I don't even know what this is going to  I don't even know what I said  Oh, it's awful  I was going to wear like a blue Jack LaLanne jumpsuit  Just to take the focus off how bad I'm going to sound  No, there's no way you can take the focus off it  You're awful  I heard a minute of it, it sounded pretty cool  I know, you son of a bitch 
[01:44:00]  It's like, you know what?  It brings back memories of being a kid  And when another kid down the block would fall off a bike  You'd just hear like his screaming  And know something was wrong  From a grown man, it's a little odd  But, you know, I understand  You understand, I heard my leg snap  Yeah, no, I understand  Believe me, there's a lot of pain there, I guess  I mean  Twice  We're going to play the audio next  The audio?  Yeah, we're just wasting time now  Dirk, get us out of here  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze 
[01:44:30]  Squeeze the bread  Squeeze the bread  No shit  It's real, real soft  Almost like pudding  Almost like pudding  Yes  It's a hot piece of ass  Quite a handful  Yeah  The nipples are so sensitive  Yeah  That a mere tweak between finger and thumb  Will give a perfectly good result  The Opian Anthony Show  In case you didn't know  Oh, God 
[01:45:00]  We're back with the Opian Anthony program  We like to call it the O-N-I  O-N-I  O-N-I  O-N-A virus spreading across America  By the way, the Spread the Virus t-shirts have been made  Ooh  And they're being mailed out as we speak 
[01:45:30]  If you order a shirt  Bob Kelly in studio  Bob Kelly in studio  Yeah  And Ben ran in here in a panic  I mean, he's doing his job  But basically, there's a whole bunch of people from Washington up today  Because we're doing a big thing at Lincoln Center later tonight, I guess  And  Were you invited to that, by the way?  Yeah, we're invited  And I guess we want to paint Sandy Kane  And  I don't know what happened to radio  Now we have to make announcements  We have to  You know, put up all sorts of tarps and stuff 
[01:46:00]  So no one sees nudity  Why can't we just  No one can be offended  Why can't we have a huge sign on the door  If you're entering this area  You may see nude people  Right  We will have that eventually  This is  Look at this  They've got to stretch a tarp across  Motherfuckers, man  Enough  Doesn't anyone  Even resources  Don't  But we're the only ones  We're the only ones working  We're the only ones working today  Everyone else are just observers  Make an announcement  If you don't like this 
[01:46:30]  Get out of the offices  Get out of the studio area  Leave  And who wants to look at Sandy Kane anyway?  Exactly  They're not going to be looking at her  If they looked over there  They'd probably think it was an autopsy  A really, like, a dead person's pubes  It's awful  And they don't have much, like, meat to them  Dead person  I'm frightened of how you would know what that looks like  Yeah, I've seen a dead person  Dead person pubes  Sandy Kane needs some conditioner in her hair, too 
[01:47:00]  Jesus  Oh, man  She looks like an old rock star  You know what her hair looks like?  Remember the taxi episode when Elaine Nardo got her hair?  And Ted Danson did it all red and awful?  Anybody?  Oh, there's going to be a scene  Anybody remember that one?  If you do out there, you'll know how old it is  Alright, well  Why don't we get to the Bob Kelly audio?  This show has just turned into another clusterfuck  Watch language  Sorry  It sounded like that  We're about to curse every once in a while  We use it when we need it, not because we have it  Am I right around?  I'm trying to 
[01:47:30]  I'm trying to just look at what's going on outside  So I can describe it to the listeners  Not because I want to  Sandy's out there  She's talking to one of the painters, I guess  One of the guys that's going to paint her up  And  Can we get a mic out there?  Yeah, we have a mic out there  It seems to be important  Eric  What's she saying?  Alright, we're on  Like Sandy's talking  Hello  Alright, Eric is outside the studio  Hello  Eric  So cute  Ask her what she 
[01:48:00]  What are you doing later?  Alright, you know what  See, that's not  Eric, how are we supposed to talk to Sandy Kane if she can't hear us?  You are Keith  Gorgeous eyes  But that wasn't it  The thing was to just sneak the mic in there  What she was saying to the guy that's going to paint her up  Shut up  Now everyone's on, you know what I mean?  It's supposed to be like some  I gotcha  Yeah, now it's just nothing  I don't really care about it  Alright, we're just  Forget it  We're not even going to go there  It's going to be a waste of time  Poor airbrushing guy  Oh, that guy  He had such a great morning 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  And now let's just go to right  I hope he throws up  If he throws up  You know what's really funny right now?  Eric thinks we're still interviewing Sandy Kane  Yeah  He's holding the mic in front of her  Mm-hmm  And we gave up on this bit  Yeah  And Sandy's still babbling  Well  Her headphones are all screwed up  She's got  She's got mummy hair  Oh my god  Get my mother's hair  Alright, listen 
[01:49:00]  Can someone tell Eric to stop putting his fucking hat on his head  Like he's one of the Bowery boys  He doesn't wear a hat  He just places it on his head  And traipses around like a sissy  Like Satch  Ben, let's get her painted  He's Vic Morrow in Blackboard Jungle  Fix that hat  Yeah, come on, teach  Okay  Wait, wait  What's the matter?  Mars  You're panicking  Alright  Alright, listen  Alright, that's another visual that no one gets 
[01:49:30]  I'm laughing  I'll be right back  Tell Sandy  We got to get started with the painting  Yeah  We want to paint her up  Why is she wearing two bras?  She just took one bra off  She's got another bra on  One to absorb the sweat  Alright, she's getting naked, I guess  Now the painter  Slowly but surely  Look at the painter's face  Poor guy  He had  Now he's laughing  He just looked over like  Oh my god  My morning was so promising 
[01:50:00]  You've got to take the bra off first  Okay  Thank you  You're welcome  Alright, she has  She has taken off her second bra now, Anthony  She's wearing pasties with tassels on them  Like it's the thirties  These are real  Yeah, obviously  Oh, you've really got to say that?  There's no real question there  Huh?  That girl's tits  Are phony  Let's just say it  Can we take the tassels off her? 
[01:50:30]  Should we leave the tassels on?  Can you not ask the same question he just asked?  Take the tassels off  She doesn't even have nipples  See, these are real tits  They hang  Alright, we did  They always hung  So they have real tumors in them  Look at those veins in them  It looks like a football player  They always had veins, too  I've had veins since I was 14  Yeah  And not my legs  We've all had veins since we were 14  Yeah, it's part of how blood gets from the brain to the body  Stupid 
[01:51:00]  Way before that  Okay  Somebody threw water on you finally  And you became a person  I do believe you said it's how blood gets from the brain to the body  Yes, I meant the heart  I just knew they'd call you out here  Well, the brain also uses veins  What do you think the brain does?  Send a note to old vein heart?  It's a fucking combination  So technically that's correct  Alright  Then again, the heart does pump all that blood  The brain to the body, though  Okay  Good point  What if you're Dracula?  That fucking vampire out there 
[01:51:30]  Escarp, yeah  Alright, sleeping dirt  Why does she still have the tassels on?  I don't know  Why hasn't she been shot at one point in her life?  She's fucking awful  Do you have an erection?  No  It looked like he had an erection, you know, Eric  Those big tassels  Sorry, and he has paint by his fly  Remember those things that were hanging on the bottom of the curtains in King Kong  When they lifted the curtain up  Those big tassels on the bottom of the curtains  That's what she's wearing on her tits  They're huge, like  Men notice men more than women do  Big curtain tassels  And Kong bent over and spread his ass 
[01:52:00]  With a big roid  Oh my gosh  She's taking her  Look at her nipples  Penis envy  Alright, we're going to fade them out  They're going to start painting out there  He just opened up a can of Dutch Boy  And a roller  And a roller  He's out there with a screwdriver trying to pry the lid off  Hopefully this paint has lead in it  You know how they should paint her?  Put her on the hood of a car in an auto assembly line and just send her through  Hold your nose, whore 
[01:52:30]  You ever see Blue Collar?  Yeah  The way Yafit Kodo died?  Oh right, in the paint room  Yeah  Alright, can we play some of the Bob Kelly audio?  Of course  Is it a Bob Kelly?  Oh, from your CD?  Yeah, from my CD  Jeez, son of a bitch  This is the audio that everybody has been waiting to hear  It's so funny  I listened to when you guys called me up on the bus  Yeah  And I was on mic and out of it  Oh, you were completely out of it  But when you guys, as soon as you guys were like, ah, that's cool, man 
[01:53:00]  And then you got back on with Dan  You were like, you gotta get us that audio  Just the evil  Oh, yeah  So  You need the audio  You need to get us that audio  Yeah, we were all caring and stuff  And it's like, oh my god, when do we have it?

[01:53:30]  But you know  You know, stupid Dane  Had the camera lady  She was  You gotta talk in the mic  Yeah, Bob  These mics are fucked up today  If you don't talk in the mic  You're gonna not hear yourself in the replay  I mean, we have  Uni or Army Directional, right?  Huh?  What?  I don't know what it is anymore  They  Just when I got hurt  The camera lady  She was a lady  Yeah  You know she wanted to stop filming  Yeah  Because it was pretty bad  But you know, Dane was in the background  Just, you know, spinning his hand in the air  Keep rolling, bitch  Keep it rolling  Keep it rolling  Alright, give us the setup, Bob 
[01:54:00]  Once again  Because we are getting new listeners every day  Right  Well, we're on the tourgasm with Dane  We had a day off  We were playing a little touch football  Just for shits and giggles  As they say in Long Island  And it started getting a little serious  I jumped out  Smoke a butt  And then one of the guys  There was like a couple plays left  The exec producer  Told me to jump back in  I did  This six foot three Dominican  Who doesn't know how to play football 
[01:54:30]  He knows how to kick a soccer ball  We both jumped up for a ball  He wrapped his leg around my leg  And his weight and my weight  All came down on my right knee  On a slanty hill  And I'm not talking about a little Asian kid  And my leg snapped backwards  And snapped sideways  And I pretty much believe I felt  On the sideways one  I think I felt my heel hit my quadricep 
[01:55:00]  I swear to God  I don't know if it happened  But I think it  I think I felt my  Oh my God  Yeah dude  And  That hurts  And the sound  I mean you could hear it  Like  Ripping  You know what hurt  It hurt like nothing  I almost passed out  But  The visual  Because I  I kind of felt  The movement of my leg  So I had the visual  That kept repeating itself  Yeah  With the sound  Yeah 
[01:55:30]  That would not stop  I thought my bone popped out  I literally thought my leg  Was probably  Just my  At my knee ripped  You were going to look at it  And just see like  White bone popping out  Yeah  It was just going to be  You know  The Terry Fox story  You must have had to take in  Like four Tylenol for this  Yeah  I almost got addicted  Hold on a second  Four Tylenol aren't going to help Opie  Isn't Vicodin great  Dude I had to  You just take it  And  And like  The pain  Goes away 
[01:56:00]  It's just gone  And you sit there  In this fog  This  Euphoric fog  Where you just  Everything's cool  You're kind of in slow motion  You're all tingly  Great drug  I was waking up  Shaken though  I had to stop  I was waking up in the morning  My hands were shaking  Because you needed another Vicodin  It does make you shake  And it makes you itch  Like my head was itching  Really  And it said  One of the side effects  Could be itchiness  Oh I hate itchiness  You feel itch  But you don't care  Because you're on Vicodin  And it's great  I never took one 
[01:56:30]  I couldn't remember anything  People were asking me stuff  And I was just like  I don't know  When's your next show  I don't know  I don't know  You don't know anything  You go up  You get up to take a piss  And you're all wobbly  You can't even walk  Through the hallway  Oh it's great  Great drug  The dreams are pretty wild too  Yeah  The dreams are like reality  Yeah nice  Psychedelic  So that's basically  What happened  Oh  Okay  Well we got the audio  Yeah  Let's play a little  I think we have the actual  Play and everything

Did you really say I need something to squeeze?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Huh?  Yeah?  Geez, I didn't hear that.  Yeah, I didn't either.  Oh, we'll probably have to listen again.  Yeah, we're gonna have to get to that part again.  Uh, Anthony, did I lose you?  Yeah, I lost him.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Alright, Jim in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, Bob, thanks a lot, man.  My knee, which hasn't bothered me for two years, is screaming listening to that audio.  Can you hold my hand? 
[02:14:30]  And guys, you gotta make that video available.  Uh, the video will be available, right?  Cool.  Later, boys.  Alright, it's gonna be the big, uh, the big thing on the DVD, I guess.  Yeah, a tour game.  It might be actually a TV show.  Oh, good.  And it might make it into a reality TV show.  What channel, Bob?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Independent film channel?  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Hey, boys, I just got one question.  Uh, hey, Bobby, who won the football game?  That's the important thing.  You know, I actually, I'll tell you right now, that, that catch, if that Dominican got 
[02:15:00]  that catch, they would've got another play.  But not only did I block the ball from him catching it, I also snapped my knee to end  the game.  So we did win.  That pretty much ended the game?  Yeah, that was my whole plan.  Really?  Good point.  I'm gonna snap my knee so the game ends and we win out of four minutes.  Go ahead.  Let's see the old Darryl Stingley play.  Oh.  I should've just said...  At least you said it with a mouth full of tuna.  You bet I did.  Is that Liddy?  Ah, you know, the guy fell. 
[02:15:30]  Liddy stinks.  Oh, God.  That's the worst.  What the fuck was that little thing you had in your hand, a puppet?  That's Liddy.  No, that's Liddy.  That's Liddy, man.  That's G-Yogurt Liddy.  That's a new character on the show.  New character, but he really has improv skills for a little lacking, man.  Yeah, nice knee.  That sucks.  So the video's done.  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  Is that Liddy?  That sucks.  That sucks.  So the video's not available.  It won't be available until the DVD comes out, probably, or the TV show? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Torgasm, whatever it's going to happen.  Because I know people are going to try to find that thing.  People want, like James wants Steve to make a promo with the Hootie and the Blowfish song,  Hold My Hand.  And, of course, the Beatles, I want to hold your hand.  Things like that can be used, I guess, with the audio.  And people get to work on that.  All right.  Let's go to Eric in Montana.  Hey.  You know what?  Hang on it.  Hold on.  You know, we have, like, a lot of audience participation that goes on with this show.  Take that audio and do something fun with it and send it into the show. 
[02:16:30]  Do something.  It doesn't matter.  We'll get the audio up just by itself and you guys go have fun with it.  Could be that.  Could be Psycho X Girlfriend.  Could be Pat O'Brien.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever you want to do with that.  Whatever you want to do.  That'll be your next project as a listener of the show.  Eric in Montana, what's up?  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  Sounds like some male soft porn.  And if you could do me a favor, could you measure twaddle?  Me and the roofing crew have a little bed.  I'm thinking it's about three inches. 
[02:17:00]  My foreman thinks it's one by one.  It looks like a small ear.  I think it's between both of your measurements there.  It's about two by two, I'd say.  It depends how hot it is, though, too.  It's hot.  It swells up.  It expands.  It expands.  It stretches like bubble gum.  Oh.  Oh.  Turkish taffy.  It starts hanging and ready to separate from the body, but it just doesn't make it.  That's great.  Like the old Turkish taffy.  You could freeze it and knock it on the counter and it shatters. 
[02:17:30]  But that little fleshy stem just holds it on.  Oh, the stem.  That little...  It's like a little piece of flesh stalk.  Like a mushroom root.  A little fleshy stem.  The stem.  Sticking out of the pubis, just holding it on there.  A little...  You know what that is?  It's just probably cancerous.  It's cancerous.  It's a cancerous genital work.  That's what she has.  But she's had it forever.  But it's got to be cancerous.  The doctor said that little fleshy stem that holds it on.  All right.  The phones have just exploded.  Let's go to Fresno. 
[02:18:00]  Kevin, what's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to ask Bob, you know, did he ask anyone maybe finger his ass to take some  of the pain away and get his mind off what's going on?  I think he whispered it.  Don't act like I wouldn't actually do that in real life.  I'd do that myself.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You want to smell my finger?  Hey, Chris from Boston has a good observation.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, do you think Joe Feisman asked Lawrence Taylor to hold his hand after he snapped him  like a twig?  Let's just get this straight.  I never claimed to be a friggin' man. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  Let's go back to the audio.  Oh, no.  Just make sure my slip isn't showing.  I'm showing.  Oh, no.  Did you get my skirts from the laundromat?  I broke my heel, man.  Sandy Kane's trying to get our attention.  Trust me, Sandy.  We'll get to you.  Relax.  She's all done out there, Anthony, as we could all say.  Anyway, more audio of Bob Kelly in pain.  I can't do anything.  I could do anything.  Wait. 
[02:19:00]  What's that?  I can do anything.  Is that all you want me to talk about?  You want me to go?  I can't do anything.  I can't do anything.  I can't do anything.  All right.  Give a smile.  I'm not going to drool.  They pulled the plug on that. 
[02:19:30]  Jesus, what a mess.  Thank God he pulled the plug.  I sound like an old Kawasaki.  One of the minibikes.  A couple of whales communicating.  Let's go back to the tape here.  Oh, a chair.  It has to be higher than that.  Want a chair?  No, we need to elevate the knee about the heart.  Can you see?  Where's her? 
[02:20:00]  I don't know.  It's on the side.  It's on the outside.  Danny's getting a chair.  Oh, God.  Hey, you guys.  Hey, man.  The whole thing is to have it higher than the heart.  That way it doesn't get old. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  All right.  You've got to help us here.  We've got to lift your leg.  Oh, my God.  Right there, right there.  There we go.  More, more, more.  Put it right here.  Down here.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  You've got to go.  There you go.  Fucking man.  Fuck.  You've got to be shitting me, man.  God, that fucking hurts.  Came down with the ball.  That's all that matters.  A little joke.  You want a pillow? 
[02:21:00]  You want to raise your head, Bobby?  You want this under your head, bro?  Maybe you should keep his neck straight.  No, no, no.  Keep the head straight.  Yeah, no.  Keep the head straight.  Okay.  Okay.  Just try not to move on too much, bro.  Look.  Can we take some aspirin?  I think you're supposed to wait on that.  Yeah, maybe we should wait.  Because they might want to give him something else.  They gave me Stella breaks when that happened to me.  What?  Jamie and me?  Yeah.  Well, that's what they did.  And then the swelling went away.  And the swelling was in a couple of days. 
[02:21:30]  But, boy, we're going to have to mobilize the knee.  That's the main thing.  Stereotyping.  And that's how it ends.  Good shape.  Wow.  Yeah, we're going to get the audio up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com  so the listeners can have some fun with that audio.  That does seem painful.  Well, I've got to say, you know, you can't downplay that. 
[02:22:00]  I really am a figure.  I really don't know how to take pain too well.  The old pain threshold a little low on you?  You know, we're comics, though.  It's not like we're out there playing football every Sunday on a league.  Right.  You know, pretty much we walk upstairs and hold the microphone.  Yeah.  More emotional pain you guys are used to.  We have little thin fingers, no calluses.  You guys can take a lot of emotional pain.  It's the physical pain you guys really can't take much of.  Well, I can take, I just, yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Well, yeah, I guess that's it.  Like when Jerry Seinfeld says, not you.  You feel hurt, but you're not going, ah.  Right.  Well, I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Perhaps when Jerry went, not you.  You went, ah.  Jerry, hold my hand.  Hold my dignity.  Hold my dignity.  Oh, you'll deny it to the end, but I saw Dumbbell choking up again.  I wanted to, I never wanted to splash hot coffee in his face as badly as I did the other day.  We were at his apartment watching Anger Management at the end. 
[02:23:00]  It was one of those corny speeches, like Adam Sandler, and he talks to the chick in the crowd.  I love you.  I can be right for you.  And I see Fucko batting his eyes quickly.  Stop those tears from flowing.  I wanted to mace you.  Just come in, Fucko.  His eyes were music.  He was going to cry.  He was doing the fast eye blink.  Oh, God.  Not while he's here.  Flutter, flutter.  Flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter.  He's out of his mouth.  Taking a heel to the side of his knee.  First of all, there was dust in the air.  Right.  I wasn't crying. 
[02:23:30]  No, you almost did, though.  I was laughing at him because he just went, he saw the emotional part of the movie where  music kicked in, and he looked back at me, he goes, you faggot, if you cry, and he just  walked off on a tangent just to stop my emotions in their tracks.  But I was actually laughing at this jackass just slamming me.  It's funny.  He didn't laugh at all.  There was no ha-ha or woo-hoo.  It was bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  Classy-eyed jizzbucket. 
[02:24:00]  It's kind of like you on stage.  You choke up at movies?  Huh?  You choke up at movies a lot?  You know what I did?  I don't.  I cry with kids.  Yeah.  Apparently midgets.  Apparently midgets.  They look like kids.  Anybody under three feet?  And forget it.  Waterworks.  And I cry at Rocky.  Rocky?  Rocky makes me cry.  What, at the end?  At the end where he goes, and the hat comes off and she runs up and they hold each other.  And I cry at two, two.  Number two when he hugs Mick.  Rocky two? 
[02:24:30]  He's tearing up right now.  Or is that Rocky three where Mickey dies?  Yeah.  That's Rocky three.  That didn't make me cry.  But you know what made me cry in that one?  Where, you know, it goes, she wakes up.  Yeah.  He goes, what do you want me to do?  Wind.  Ding.  That's part two.  Oh, that's part two.  That part makes me cry.  That's part every movie.  Rocky, you can't do it.  Rocky, don't do it.  Rocky falls into this depression.  He stinks.  He doesn't have the oomph, the eye of the tiger, whatever it is.  And then Adrian finally gets some sense knocked into her. 
[02:25:00]  He goes, Rocky, do it.  Bong.  The training montage, the fight, Rocky wins.  When did you cry during that one?  If that was a real Italian from Philly, she would have got a sock right in the eye.  Of course.  Shut up, bitch.  I'm a little fighting, Whitty.  When did you cry during part two when he was actually auditioning and reading and you  realized that he was a better actor than you?  This, let me tell you, this is great.  It smells mainly.  It smells mainly.  Could you, Mickey, could you hold my hand?  Yes, let me squeeze it. 
[02:25:30]  Cut me, Mickey.  Ow, ow, ow.  All right, let's get Sandy Kane in here because Ben wants to wrap up this segment before the  corporate people show up.  We got a lot of corporate people coming to New York today for the big grand opening of  the New York City facility, I guess, at the Lincoln Center.  Yeah, we're going there.  What time is it, Opie?  I don't know, like 5, 5.15 around there.  A lot of celebrities.  It's going to be fun.  Can I get my picture taken with some famous people, Opie?  You sure can, Jimmy. 
[02:26:00]  Here she comes.  Looking just as hot as the girls we had in from the IFC channel.  That's right.  It's Sandy Kane in body paint.  Why do they do you up like the sound of a train in the Bronx?  As lovely as I think I am, I think I'm better looking than those girls.  You're not.  Oh, wow.  Hey, I'm better looking than Storker Patty.  I feel like we're just in a time machine.  Okay, hello.  Nothing.  So, how's your leg?  How's your leg?  Your middle one.  Ah, I get it.  You look like an apple that was left in the sun too long. 
[02:26:30]  You does look like a shrunken apple.  Well, she's got wow written on her titties.  I'm just wondering, should I light my tits up with the wow in it?  You should do, but you should start with the top of your scalp and just dump gas.  Like they do in jail.  One guy walks by with a balloon full of gas.  Yeah.  Drops it on your head, and the next time I walk by with a match and throws it on you.  Lights you up.  Yeah.  Do you think I'll explode if, um...  All right, let's just describe what she looks like.  We got the video.  It will be up on opianthony.com. 
[02:27:00]  You know what it may be?  Let's get her the hell out of here.  She's got wow painted on her boobs, right?  The letters are about six, eight inches high.  Mm-hmm.  Probably even ten if you go from the W, top of the W to the bottom of the O, written on  her boobs, yet they don't touch her nipples.  Like it's all just on...  Your boobs are so long that they wrote wow on it in eight-inch letters, and it's not touching  your nipples.  She does look like a deflated Macy Day float. 
[02:27:30]  By the way, why isn't she walking around with...  We got to put little nipple covers.  Why isn't she walking around advertising for this program on Broadway like they do?  I mean, you're allowed to do that.  Yeah, why don't you walk up and down the sidewalk?  No, I'm done.  Get the tassels back on.  Yeah, we might as well, right?  On 42nd Street and 8th Avenue.  What about that?  We're going to get you...  Right down 57th.  Right down 57th.  Listen, I'm going to turn her mic off because she's going to babble.  Can they paint Opie and Anthony on the back?  I think they should paint Opie and Anthony on the back.  Absolutely.  Her hair covers.  Yeah, her hair. 
[02:28:00]  No, it's good enough.  It says Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio, the WOW logo, and then IFC for whatever reason.  And we'll have her walk up and down 57th Street, and we'll have Eric or somebody on  a cell phone, and we'll get the reaction of the horrified commuters.  Right.  You can just break some of her hair off like spaghetti.  Your hair's a little dry.  I think you need conditioner.  Do you use conditioner?  Yeah.  You should use mayonnaise.  I think I need...  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's why I like to wear a wig.  You know what?  You need a haircut from Alzar Kelly. 
[02:28:30]  Who's that?  Jim, you go beneath my legs.  I listen.  I'm just saying, Jim.  I know he's funny, but sometimes...  Anthony, we're going to take a break.  He's so deep for me.  We'll get Sandy Cain out on the streets of New York completely topless with this paint  job that they did.  They did a great job with the painting, by the way.  It's great.  Excellent.  And the tits are great.  Anyway.  You don't think?  Anyway.  I don't think you like my tits.  Anyway, we'll get back and we'll do some more stuff.  We got the...  They're double Ds.  We got the lady getting tasered.  Divine and delightful. 
[02:29:00]  I think that was in Florida.  She's still babbling, Anthony.  Wish we had a taser here.  We also have, well, lots of things to get to.  Lots of audio.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Also, if she can hold on, Jennifer Tilly wants to say hi.  She's on hold.  I got to take a leak.  I'll never make it.  Unless someone else wants to talk to Jennifer Tilly.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We'll go to Jennifer Tilly.  I love Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer?  Hold on.  Are you guys ready?  You're not Jennifer.  Where's Jennifer?  Jennifer, you're not her.  Your voice is deep.  You're not Jennifer. 
[02:29:30]  Jennifer Tilly.  Whoa, hey.  Hey, is this Opie and Anthony?  Hi, Jennifer.  How are you?  I'm good.  Thank you.  I just had XM Radio installed in my car.  And when I'm looking for my channel, I always school past Opie and Anthony.  And I always wondered who they were.  Oh, well, now you can stop on it.  Now I'll stop.  We actually talked to you in L.A. at the World Poker, what was it?  Oh, right.  I remember that.  You had that whole room set up.  Yeah, we were.  You were trying to play tricks on the contestant. 
[02:30:00]  You were trying to get somebody to, you're trying to get everybody to feel somebody's arm.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was Jimmy.  That was my arm.  You were the only one that wouldn't feel my arm.  Yes.  I was too clever.  Yes.  You were definitely clever.  I totally remember that.  Are you still playing poker, obviously?  Yes, I am.  You know, my boyfriend is a professional poker player, and we're leaving next week to go to  the World Series of Poker.  Wait, who's her boyfriend?  Phil the Unabomber lock.  That's your boyfriend?  Yeah, he's my boyfriend.  The Unabomber's your boyfriend? 
[02:30:30]  He's teaching me everything I know.  Wow.  You're going to be really good at poker then.  Well, you know, it's like I'm really competitive with the men that I go out with, and so my  friends say it's a really terrible trait of mine.  They say, let Phil be the poker player, because now I'm determined to be the next Doyle Brunson.  The next Doyle Brunson, except for with breath.  Well, you're not that old.  The lovely ones.  And I just wrote an article for Bluff Magazine.  It's a poker magazine, because that's what the poker players do.  They play poker, and then they try to expand their profile by writing articles about what 
[02:31:00]  good poker players they are.  And so I wrote an article that's in the current Bluff Magazine.  Hey, Jennifer.  Yes?  How does Phil feel about that commercial that they keep playing and playing, and him getting  totally beat out on that Bluff?  You know what?  He kind of doesn't mind it, because there's no such thing as bad publicity, but it sort of  annoys him, because he said, this is how he talks.  He says the math just wasn't there.  He said it wasn't a bluff. 
[02:31:30]  He didn't, I forget what it was.  He said he, for some reason, he tells this story, and I don't remember, because it's  not too important to me, but he tells this story like he didn't make a wrong move to  throw away that low pair.  So there's some reason where he absolutely made the correct move, but it makes him look  like a doofus.  Yeah, it does make him look really bad.  And they play it like a thousand times every time you're watching the channel.  Yeah, you know what?  But that's good publicity for him. 
[02:32:00]  Are you going to play in the World Series?  Yes, I am.  I'm going to play.  The main event there, they're limiting the participants to 6,600 people.  Limiting it to that many.  Limiting it.  I ran it.  When I was at the last tournament, I ran into Mel Judy.  He said when he started out, there was 150 entrants in the World Poker Tour.  Yeah.  And not the World Poker Tour, in the World Series of Poker.  Now there's 6,600.  It's almost insurmountable odds to be the winner.  But somebody's going to do it.  Even if you get to the final table, you've got to be really good or really lucky. 
[02:32:30]  I think really lucky.  Yeah?  You think it's more luck than the skill?  We just got back from a tournament, and Phil died on the bubble, which means if you're  number 28, you get no money.  If you get out of 317 people, if you're number 27, you get $18,000.  So, of course, he busted out number 28.  Ah, so he got nothing.  He looked down at pocket aces.  The flop came up, ace, rag, rag.  So he had trip aces. 
[02:33:00]  And then on the very last card, the other guy got a flush, and so he was out of the  tournament.  No money.  Yeah, that was a sad...  Does he ask you for money when he loses?  No.  It's like, yeah, Jennifer, I need some money.  I've got to play poker, and I'm out.  He has his own money.  He's like a squirrel.  He has a squirrel away, like every casino in America.  He's got these little lock boxes, and he goes and gets his money out.  I'm amazed that, like, the poker players now are such celebrities that they're getting 
[02:33:30]  the likes of Jennifer Tilly as their chicks.  I can't believe that I'm going out with a poker player.  No, these guys, and you know this, before all this really took off, poker players were  known as, like, lowlifes.  Even though they weren't, but the perception was that they were, you know, lowlifes on the  skids, trying to scam for a living.  And now they're celebrities with endorsement deals and Hollywood chicks.  Yeah, no, it's true.  He said four years ago, if you said you were a poker player, girls would be like, ew. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, they'd hide their money.  Yeah, he says, no, they're like, hey, you know, like, well, there's a perception, too,  because of all the publicity the poker's getting, that all the poker players that are recognizable  have millions of dollars, and that sounds...  I know it's not true in Phil's case, but, you know.  Yeah, girls go where the money and fame is.  Not myself, of course.  Girls after him all the time, though?  Yeah, there's poker groupies out there. 
[02:34:30]  Poker groupies.  Come on, really?  Yeah, that's why I have to travel around.  A poker groupie, man.  Wow.  That's rough.  It's true.  It's a whole other world.  Damn.  And how is he dealing with you, you know, your acting?  Good job.  Well, you know, lately I haven't been working much.  Why not?  Well, because I've reached the point in my career, and this is God's honest truth, where  I don't have to work, and so unless I get offered something that's interesting, I'm not  really willing to go away for two months in Romania, for example, and, you know, be away 
[02:35:00]  from my man and my friends.  And a lot of the stuff I get offered is stuff I'm not too interested in doing.  I just finished doing a movie with Terry Gilliam, and that was great.  And I love doing Cedar Chucky, which I guess I should talk about.  Of course.  We only have ten minutes.  And, yeah, so if something's interesting to me, I'll do it, but lately the things I've  been offered haven't interested me.  Maybe I'm just getting all bludzy.  I think I'm having a midlife crisis a little bit early. 
[02:35:30]  You're obsessed with poker, too.  You want to be the best you can be.  Yeah, that's true.  That's a new career for you.  That's my new career to become a poker degenerate.  Is Phil considered a chippy for you?  A chippy?  What's that?  You know, when you say you're going through a midlife crisis, are you picking up like a  younger guy?  No, no.  He's not.  He's really a great guy.  Yeah?  He's not.  It's not like he's an Ashton Cushter.  Ashton Cushter. 
[02:36:00]  Or whoever that is.  Oh, okay.  Who do you play in Seeds of Chucky?  Shut up.  I want to know who she plays.  I can't believe you guys have not seen Seeds of Chucky.  No, no, no.  Not you guys.  Jim Norton hasn't seen the movie.  I haven't seen it.  I just...  Jim, are you the person whose arm I wouldn't touch?  Yes, that's me.  Okay, I knew there was a reason.  No, I'm a good egg.  I just...  I haven't seen it.  Seeds of Chucky?  Chucky's chick.  It's a great thing because Seeds of Chucky is coming out on DVD and I believe it's going  to be a very big cult movie on DVD. 
[02:36:30]  In fact, I'm hoping...  I play two parts.  I play Tiffany, the homicidal doll that kills people.  Yeah.  And then I play Jennifer Tilly, international star of Scream.  Mm-hmm.  She's got a dual role in the movie.  Wait, wait, aren't you supposed to say international star of...  Oh, stage and screen.  Stage and screen.  Stage and screen.  I knew there was two things.  And yeah, so I have a dual role and Tiffany is obsessed with me.  So she's sort of stalking me.  She's my biggest fan because people have told her that she sounds just like me and she actually 
[02:37:00]  thinks she looks just like me.  And so she's...  And then her and Chucky decide I would be the perfect receptacle for their spawn.  And so in this movie, I get artificially inseminated with the seed of Chucky.  Um, I give birth to two beautiful, bouncing baby boys.  You, as Jennifer Tilly...  Me, as Jennifer Tilly.  ...get impregnated by Chucky.  By Chucky's sperm.  And actually on the DVD, you'll see something that you did not see in the film, which...  Your vagina.  No.  You don't see... 
[02:37:30]  You never see my vagina after my contract.  But you do see, um, Chucky's little plastic...  Um, oh, can I see penis on saddle?  Yes, you can.  You see his little plastic penis.  Chucky, Chucky junk.  And I see Chuck is played by, uh, Brad Dourif, who everyone knows was Billy Bivitt in Cuckoo's Nest.  Yes, and on Deadwood, nominated for an Emmy on Deadwood, and he's an amazing actor.  He's great.  And, um, he's actually, when he was doing Chucky, he put a lot of work into it.  Okay, the...  Every now and then, they crack the door, and they come in, and they sort of wave their arms, 
[02:38:00]  like, wrap it up, wrap it up.  Oh, yeah, they do that.  But I have one more thing I want to say, because I'm nominated for an MTV Award for Most Frightened  Performance.  Oh.  And I never get, I never get nominated for anything, except for Oscars and stuff.  But I never win anything, so everybody has to go to MTV.com and vote for me.  Most Frightened Performance.  All right.  Because I was, I was truly, truly frightened when I was making this movie.  I, I think you're great, and a friend of mine is, like, a really big fan of yours, and  he was saying, like, because a lot of your work over the years, he was saying, has just 
[02:38:30]  gotten, like, whereas a lot of people will kind of, like, not go into the right direction  and taper, he was just kind of, like, saying that your stuff has never kind of had, like,  that type of an effect, like a, you know, boom.  Well, what kind of effect were you trying to take?  No, that's a good point, actually.  Well, it never had, what kind of effect?  Just, just that your stuff has never really tapered off.  You've gotten, like, very stronger and stronger, whereas a lot of people will do a certain  amount of stuff that is strong, and then all of a sudden, when it comes around to redoing  something or coming back to it, there's just never that time. 
[02:39:00]  I, I, I agree with that, actually.  Well, I'm not quite sure what you said, but I think, uh, it was very nicely put.  I think you're great.  Hey, Jennifer, real fast, uh, what else is on the DVD that we can look forward to?  Well, they have...  Any good extras, or...  All kinds of extras.  There's an audio commentary...  Well, we got that.  ...with myself and Don Mancini.  There's a, a slideshow, like, a little thing that they, they filmed all these  extra things.  I made a short video for Jay Leno about my experiences in Romania.  That's on it.  My Chucky diary is on it, where I give you all the backstage scoop. 
[02:39:30]  There's tons and tons of stuff, because Don Mancini, the producer, he's a big video geek,  and he put, he knows when he buys a DVD, he likes lots and lots of extras.  So this, um, DVD is crammed full of extras.  All right.  All right.  Well, we have to let you go.  It's, uh, Jennifer Tilly.  Thank you.  The DVD, Seed of Chucky.  That comes out, I guess, very soon.  I don't know...  The 7th at a, at a video store near you.  Oh, my God.  We got to leave the studio.  Jimmy just farted.  Bye.  Bye, Jennifer.  Boots always bring this, uh, show to a hall. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, screeching hall.  I'm going to play it.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is beautiful.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Wow, that's cool.  How about the woman that took me?  Turn off.  Ah, yeah.  Sexy girl.  Sex, sexy girl.  You have sorry. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  Or else you'll move.  Move.  I see boobs.  Move.  Yes.  You just got a wow.  Wow.  Hey.  That was amazing.  That's nice.  Bopey and Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  Wow.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Can't see your report.  Oh, dear.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Huh?  Uh-huh.  That was your point, thanks.  Oh, wow.  B and Anthony.  XM 202.  No, baby.  It's what I got.  I said, remember that.  Love is good.  It's what I got.  I said, remember that.  Love is good.  It's what I got.  Oh, my God.  What's up, Bob?  The discussions we have while the commercials play. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  But I don't care what you say.  It's too bad.  It's a little bigger.  It's too bad we have to take leak breaks or we just leave the mics on.  Thank God we had to that time.  Why?  Thank God we were going to break before we went to the Jennifer Tilly.  That way I knew right when the interview was over I could leave the studio because when  that fart hit me, I had to leave this studio.  It was awful.  If we had just come back from break, I would have left the studio.  He put it in a cup and threw it in my face.  No, not a cup in my hand.  He took it. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy has the worst farts ever.  So he grabbed it with his hand, like grabbed the lump of air, and then threw it into Robert's  face.  Thank you for calling me, Robert.  I know.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Thank you for that.  I was trying to keep this technical.  His name's Bob.  Why don't you call him Mr. Kelly?  It's the times.  Mr. Kelly then took the full brunt of the fart, which then kind of hit me.  In the face.  You're kidding.  Oh, no.  Bob, by the way, you're from Boston.  Yeah.  We have a new bit. 
[02:42:30]  We have audio from Mayor Menina.  Oh, that retard?  Exactly.  He's the worst.  Mispronouncing everything.  If you missed it, it'll be on the replay, obviously.  He has his tongue.  He has that big, like, Down syndrome tongue.  Big cow tongue.  He can actually lick his own nipple or swat a fly out of the air with it.  Sticks it up his nostril to clean it out.  He does that, like, Down syndrome.  Yeah.  I think I'll hold the job like a pope. 
[02:43:00]  Big, fat tongue.  Big, retard tongue.  Yes.  That's okay.  I'm just listening.  We're listening.  We're just listening.  What happened?  We're enjoying it.  All of a sudden, Ed stops and goes, what?  I was being looked at all strangely.  Not at all.  All right.  So, whatever.  I got scared.  We played that earlier.  Yeah, no more farting, Jimmy.  You got really bad ones today.  Jennifer Tilly was on the phone.  I got nervous.  Is that what it was?  I wanted to yell, yay, and it just creeped out. 
[02:43:30]  What did you eat?  What are you eating that it makes you?  I don't know what.  It smells like that.  Exactly.  What are you eating?  I had some yogurt this morning.  And, um...  Too much...  Oh, Liddy.  Liddy, what type of yogurt were you on top of today?  I don't know.  It had a flavor to it.  He's got nothing.  The worst new character ever.  His fart actually battles the Lysol in this movie.  Oh, I know, yeah.  They're fighting it out.  You smell a little Lysol.  You smell a little fart. 
[02:44:00]  You're hoping the Lysol wins, but...  Oof.  All right.  Ooh.  Bad.  I'm going to go to the new XM facility party tonight.  Meet some celebs.  Celebs?  I'm going to bring my camera and get some pictures.  What type of celebs?  Oh, no.  I hope I brought my stupid charger.  I'm thinking out loud in the air.  I'm sorry.  You know what you're going to...  What, Ant?  You know what you're going to get?  Where?  It's going to be jazz people.  I don't care.  Is that what's going on there?  It's a jazz thing.  Are you going?  You wouldn't go.  You're supposed to go.  I know I'm supposed to. 
[02:44:30]  That's why I'm not saying I'm not going.  Oh, you're going, right?  But I am so not going.  You've got to go to Boss of Sex.  Dude, you're supposed to go.  No one pull me shit.  You want to fucking face Ben Sparks tomorrow morning if you don't go?  You know what?  When is it?  5.15.  5.15.  5.30.  We're out of here at 11.  Yeah.  I'm going to sit around.  Get a hotel.  Six hours.  I'm not going to...  I don't have a hotel today.  Get a car.  We'll get one.  And I'm not going to get a hotel.  Drive back in.  Take a nap in the park.  And I'm not driving back out to Long Island and driving back in.  Leave it 4 o'clock. 
[02:45:00]  You've been in 4 minutes.  Because I have a Barry Shapiro meeting.  Go to Barnes & Noble.  Get a journal.  Write some stuff.  Yeah, why don't you jot down some thoughts?  Yeah.  Maybe me and Bob can just hold hands until 6 o'clock.  Help me.  Help me.  You do a good impression there, Jimmy.  I do a good impression of a fat nobody injured on a rock.  That'll get me far in the business.  Fighting his homosexuality was just creeping out.  My leg is broken.  My leg is broken.  Bob, do you need medicine or a doctor? 
[02:45:30]  No, just take that out.  Put it on my face.  I just want to smell it.  Just rest your balls on my cheek.  Just rest them here.  Just warm them up.  Make them hot.  Make them mushy.  Make them mushy like elephant nuts on my cheek.  Just let them rest.  Well, the Bob Kelly audio is now available for your downloading pleasure on opianentony.com.  I broke the masculine wall, man.  Hey, guys, some lady got tasered in Florida. 
[02:46:00]  Hi, Opie.  And here's the story.  How would you like it if you were tasered by a cop?  Well, this happened in Florida to one woman, but police review all the cases where force is used.  They say this one was justified.  You'd be the judge.  For speeding.  You're doing 51 miles an hour.  The speed limit down.  See, Chris, it's equal to 35.  Pointon Beach Police Officer Rich McNevin pulled the driver of this Isuzu over for speeding. 
[02:46:30]  He finds the driver, Victoria Goodwin, also has a broken windshield and a brake light out.  Officer McNevin then learns that Goodwin is driving without a license and returns to arrest her.  I'm going to put your cigarette out to the vehicle for me.  But Goodwin stays in the car, talking on her phone.  Officer McNevin reaches in to pull her out.  He's arresting me.  Stop.  Don't touch me.  The policeman is, you're going to shoot me.  He's got a gun and he's going to shoot me.  Three times, Officer McNevin warns Goodwin that he will use his taser. 
[02:47:00]  Get out of the car or I'm going to tase you.  The next street off the secret.  The officer hits her with his taser a second time.  Goodwin screams and cries for two more minutes before officers move her to the squad car. 
[02:47:30]  The Palm Beach Post often Boynton Beach training Sergeant Sedgwick Aiken to offer a police perspective.  Why use the taser while Goodwin was in the car?  She pulled away from him.  Basically, she escalated the use of force.  Why then was the second taser used while Goodwin was already on the ground?  We haven't patted it down.  No one searched to see if she has any weapons or anything on her person. 
[02:48:00]  And if you go in and rush her and try to place hands on her, place on her wrist, she can injure an officer or become an injured herself.  All Boynton Beach police get tasered as part of their training so they do understand what they are doing to people when they do use their tasers.  Wow.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Good job, officer.  Get out of the car, whore.  They asked the officer why he tasered her, and this was his response.  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel. 
[02:48:30]  Holy crap.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Slim Pickens is the cop.  Cop talked like that.  Hold it.  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me. 
[02:49:00]  Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  Incidentally, that wasn't even the cop doing anything.  He had just held up an employment application.  What is wrong with you guys?  What the hell is wrong with you, man?  What the? 
[02:49:30]  How do you know she's black?  I actually don't until they said I had no idea.  She was like, I don't know who I've never been tainted before.  Just because you pour syrup on it, don't make it a pancake, officer.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  That's torture. 
[02:50:00]  That's torture.  Don't choke.  That's hilarious.  How'd you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Dave in Queens.  Dave, what's up?  What's up, guys?  No, that nigga getting tasered.  All right.  Oh, God damn.  Hold on.  Man, why?  Why go there?  Why?  We can zig and zag through things here on the show, and then the goddamn listeners kind 
[02:50:30]  of just...  And he has a good line, too.  And using a line out of a movie, like playing a Slim Pickens line is funny because it's  a movie line.  Dave, go ahead.  Try again.  I'm sorry.  That woman of African-American persuasion getting tasered sounds exactly like your  cajones thing.  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me, love. 
[02:51:00]  Someone's suggesting it also sounds like the hot dog screaming from the LSD PSA.  There we have that one.  Good.  I broke my relish, man.  The hot dog said, don't hike the ball.  My leg hurts.  Hold my bun, man.  I've been tasered, man.  Put some lotion on it, dude.  I took a bite out of the hot dog, and it asked me to hold its hand.  I called it a faggot and stepped on it. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, that is just a great story today.  Well, it's fine.  She was all cocky on her cell phone.  Oh, that's great.  He's going to shoot me.  He be, he be, he be.  Yeah, is that what she was?  Oh, she was on her cell phone.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  You really were a blubbering ass in that clip.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[02:52:00]  You haven't heard that in a long time.  She's on the banana phone.  Oh, that was funny.  All right.  Everyone calm down.  I'll be on the banana phone, and I plead to offer to be coming. 
[02:52:30]  Bob, what does that mean?  What the hell are you trying to do, Bob?  I'm just saying, Bob.  Jesus.  I don't like that kind of language.  I happen to have my young son in the car, and he's wearing diapers, and Michael Jackson's holding it.  Daddy, my hat fell off.  I hope your goddamn leg was in it.  Oh, that's so funny.  Lieutenant Bob. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  Just hold my hand, Gump.  That was good.  Well, that seemed justified.  That's one of the big stories today.  What was she not?  Was she not getting out of the car?  Yeah, she wasn't getting out of the car.  She was on her cell phone.  Because there's always a problem.  There's always a problem.  If you don't want the cops screwing with you, do what they say.  Just do it.  Derek has a clip of something.  I don't know what.  They pull you over. 
[02:53:30]  Does this need a setup?  What is it, kid?  Just play it.  What's wrong?  Ics are afraid of the water.  They can't swim.  We drown.  That's why every day we pray for rain.  What?  Hold on.  Did Derek actually get enough to try to explain this?  Look how happy Nathaniel is.  Well, yeah, Nathaniel, stupid Nathaniel.  When Derek is getting ready to play his clip, Nathaniel looks at me and us and goes, like, 
[02:54:00]  with the no, shakes his head no.  But he didn't say it because he wanted the clip to bomb.  Good boy, Nathaniel.  Of course he did.  So maybe Derek has some more clips.  Derek, where are you?  Derek is taking the rest of the day off.  Well, is that a clip of?  He just gave up.  He's looking down.  He doesn't want to look at anyone.  I thought Ricky had taken the seat for a minute.  Let's see how to Brian.  Wow.  I think that was a good clip, but you guys just aren't giving it a chance.  Is that it?  I think that clip deserves another listen.  That's just my opinion.  Brian.  I think it was a good one. 
[02:54:30]  What's up?  Hey, man.  I isolated the audio, and I can hear something at her while he's tasing her.  Uh-huh.  Your name is Toby.  I'm out.  Wow.  That's a good reference.  All right.  Well, 27 years ago.  Yeah.  There you have it.  The Florida story.  You just got to do what they say.  My uncle's a cop.  He says...  They pull you over.  Do what they say. 
[02:55:00]  He says, when a cop pulls you over, put your hands on the steering wheel and leave them there.  Because every time you go up, they don't know if they get shot.  They don't know.  They don't know.  That's why.  Make their life easier.  What I like to do, I pull over immediately.  None of this driving around for a while.  You know, you pull over.  While he's doing what he's got to do, I make sure my license is out already.  And if it's nighttime, I turn on the dome light so it's all lit up inside the car.  And put my hands on the steering wheel.  Roll the window down already. 
[02:55:30]  Everything's ready to go.  I take my cock out a little bit and show it like a PBA card.  I'm like, here's my license.  And I hold it right over my cock.  We could do something about this.  Yeah.  Looks exactly like the guy in the picture.  Yeah.  Thought maybe we could take care of this right here in Brainerd.  They go, show me your ass.  Show me your ass.  You want to go to jail?  Show me your ass.  Where are you to a Kit Kat club?  Where you break a little college? 
[02:56:00]  What you got there, a broken leg?  Oh, show me how you break your leg.  Your leg's going to be okay.  Come on, say it.  He's my leg bad, man.  As opposed to good.  Fuck, where's Jay?  He's in town, too.  We've got to get him back on the show.  Don't point that broken leg at my daddy.  I can't do any of the impressions he can do.  I'm nervous.  All right, we've got another story.  You're going to hold my hand all day, little dog? 
[02:56:30]  Or are you going to take an Advil?  Look at Advil.  Who did that?  An Advil.  That's awesome.  I know your leg is off.  Have an Excedrin.  Then the guy that had to talk about his knee injury while you were just losing your mind.  That was the guy who did it to me.  What an ass.  They gave me saratis.  Okay, listen.  Long Island Man keeps wife chained while leopards roam free.  This was a story I hit yesterday, and we got some audio.  You heard about this on Long Island Man. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  This guy's, uh, I call it him being a problem solver.  Yeah?  That's it.  Got a wife mouthing off a bit, maybe?  You chain her up in the basement.  Yep.  And let the leopards roam.  Police say Anthony Barone's two very wild leopards were never caged and, in fact, were living in the family's basement.  Investigators say the only chain Barone used was around his wife's neck.  And today, Anastasia Barone told us she's been abused by her husband for years, and she's just lucky to be alive. 
[02:57:30]  I passed out, and I was in a pool of blood, so to speak, literally, and they could smell that, because they're carnivores.  They eat raw meat, and, you know, I'm sure they could smell it, and they were, my son said that they were banging on the door.  Is that Mayor Menino's daughter?  I'm paraphrasing an exact quote.  So to speak, literally.  So to speak, literally.  Moron.  That's all we care about in that whole clip.  It doesn't matter that she was in a pool of blood and chained up.  She's been beaten up with leopards roaming around, and we don't like that. 
[02:58:00]  Technically, it was a dangling participle.  A dangling participle.  Well, you pulled that one out of thin air.  Nice.  God, is that great?  I wonder what her wedding song was.  It all starts with that nice wedding song before it goes bad.  With Tony Barone?  Look at his name, Anthony Barone.  Yeah, something stupid like that.  I had the tiger, he was saying, because it's roaming around.  I just wanted to sing it.  Here she is. 
[02:58:30]  Is that what this is?  I had the tiger, man.  Yeah.  Watch out, Bob's going to get all teary-eyed thinking about fighting his way to the cops.  Police say Anthony Barone's two very wild leopards were never caged, and, in fact, was living in the family's basement.  Investigators say the only chain Barone used was around his wife's neck,  and today Anastasia Barone told us she's been abused by her husband for years,  and she's just lucky to be alive.  I passed out, and I was in a pool of blood, so to speak literally, 
[02:59:00]  and they could smell that, because they're carnivores.  They eat raw meat, and, you know, I'm sure they could smell it,  and they were, my son said that they were banging on the door.  The animal is capable of taking down prey twice its weight. 
[02:59:30]  They could leap approximately 10 feet in the air, and they could leap out horizontally about 20 feet.  You almost start crying when she went to pick up the dog food in the pet store  and almost dropped borscht on the floor.  He was crying during the first one, not during the wind scene, but when Rocky was in that meat locker 
[03:00:00]  because those things hanging reminded him of himself.  I thought you were going to go another route, but that was funny.  Why are you hurting the meat?  Police say he would even let the leopards on occasion roam freely around his four children.  Anastasia says she would never let the leopards get near the kids.  Yes, my husband tortured me and chained me up because he's a sick man,  but it was never the case of leopards running around my children. 
[03:00:30]  That's where she drew the line.  That's where she stood up.  Hey, not around my kids.  Okay, put the chain back around my neck.  Yes, if you want to blow it, I'll stay here with you.  She's been there for years, too.  Years.  Yeah, years.  He just chained her around the neck and threw her down there and beat her up.  Years, had kids.  Ah, chained.  Well, we've got Chad in New Jersey.  He knows what the wedding song was.  Go ahead, Chad.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  I heard that the wedding song was the Unchained Melody. 
[03:01:00]  Punching out.  Kind of funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Or maybe it was, hey, break these chains.  Thanks, lady.  That's funny, Liddy.  Actually had a line that time, though.  Exactly.  What's wrong with that?  Liddy's on fire.  He's on fire.  Liddy.  Now someone's suggesting cat scratch fever.  I hate Liddy.  Jeff Leppard?  Who's that? 
[03:01:30]  I don't know, but I don't like it.  Who's that?  What is that?  Hey, you're ripping me off.  They're having Lid Wars.  Oh, he's got his own little lid.  I hate Liddy.  Oh.  I'm the anti-Liddy.  I have a goatee.  Oh.  Oh.  You're worse at ventriloquism than Otto and George.  A worse what?  That's Tom Tom.  That's worse at ventriloquism.  Oh, okay.  But it was, ventriloquism's a hard word.  You know, when I came into yogurt, the lids were doing nothing. 
[03:02:00]  The Mayan Menino was a hard word.  Look, and now that Liddy's got some competition, he's on fire.  Now he's got the lines.  Shut up, fuck face.  You know, that's almost sociopathic.  Uh-oh.  The lids are fighting.  It's hilarious.  You guys get, this is what you do for a living.  Where's my lid?  This is what you do for a living.  I have foily.  I'll just sit here and go, oh, shit.  All you do is mess up plans.  Here we go again. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, fuck.  Excuse me, can I point something out?  Why are you trying not to move your lips on radio?  I know.  I'm trying to go over and come across her.  He really thinks he's a talent scout in the other room.  Look at that kid in the fucking foil.  Sign him.  I'm just like an ass.  I had to find something to use as a puppet.  Yeah, I'm going to use foil.  Like I had to find foil.  Like I couldn't say I have a lid, too.  Yeah, well, I would have fucking ratted you out in a second.  Here's how many lids.  Just flush your hands. 
[03:03:00]  I grabbed toilet paper like I was supposed to be involved.  Talk through the tube or something.  I'm Rolo Man.  There we are.  Is this a bad Adam Sandler bit or what?  You guys do this for a living.  Don't tell anyone.  Oh, I think I broke my fruit on the bottom, man.  Most shows is guys preparing the day before.  Oh, I know.  You guys just take yogurt and fold up the lids, too.  Anthony and I are out of here at 11.02, man.  We've been calling it in for, I guess, the whole time we've been here. 
[03:03:30]  Big Doody's Jay from Jersey wants to know if Opie's evil Liddy has a goatee like Spock did.  That's what I said.  He said goatee.  Oh, we did?  I wasn't listening.  I was trying to craft my puppet out of foil.  Deep Throat got a five-second mention.  Yeah, they found the guy.  We don't even say his name.  Liddy is getting a 20-minute fucking beat.  We really are idiots.  Is it true that some high school kid found out who the Deep Throat guy was?  I don't know.  He was the first one to tell everyone who Deep Throat was?  I believe a kid. 
[03:04:00]  And then the guy had to come out?  One of the children, either his or Woodward's kid, was in camp and told somebody else.  But he's always been a suspect.  Oh, he has been?  Yeah, over the years his name has come up, but he denied it.  Yeah, and now he's saying that.  Yeah, it was me.  Mark Felt.  W. Mark Felt.  Did the reporters confirm it, though?  The two guys?  Yeah, yeah.  Woodward and Bernstein. 
[03:04:30]  Yep, that's the guy.  Wow.  He was the number two official at the FBI in the 70s, number two man.  He was a Nazi hunter after the war, and he used a lot of the spy techniques that he learned  during doing that to get in touch with Woodward and plant those little signals, like the planter  out on his porch and the little clock face on page 20 of the New York Times and things  like that.  He learned in the spy trade.  He could have done it, just mailed him a letter. 
[03:05:00]  He probably loved the whole, yeah, cloak and dagger thing.  He could have just sat on a park bench and had yogurt lids and went, I believe this goes  all the way to the top.  Yeah, there's a break-in.  Like me, a lid, it goes to the top.  See, it's going to go on top.  That's how Norton holds the lid up to the microphone, like there's sound actually coming  out of the lid.  Yeah, I know.  No, I'm holding it up in the middle.  Before you were doing this.  Norton puts it to the mic.  Yeah, well, maybe because you do not want to fucking hear Liddy?  Fine.  I don't care. 
[03:05:30]  I won't hold it up.  There you go.  You can't hear Liddy.  Fuck, you don't know anything about radio.  He'd have Woodward take cabs in the wrong direction, get off, walk, get another cab,  go back to this parking garage where they would sit and stand and talk, and he'd give them  the info.  Well, he was actually mad at Nixon, too.  Yeah.  Because he was passed up for FBI director after J. Edgar Hoover, you know.  So now they're saying, you know, maybe he had an ax to grind. 
[03:06:00]  He certainly did.  And let out a bunch of info.  So, but then Woodward and Bernstein are saying, like, you know, the myth of him has made him  more important to the whole thing than he actually was.  They're not saying that he wasn't important, but there was, it was so much information from  so many sources.  He was just one of them.  But the whole thing of him being so anonymous over the past, what, 30 years, has it been?  Why did he fucking pick Deep Throat?  Probably it was a hot porno.  It was a porno of the day. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, that was like.  Too bad it didn't happen today.  I am Sperminator.  It's 30 years.  All right.  We were talking to Slap Happy, Volume 6.  I am Black Pussy 5.  That's a good bit, man.  You know, I am, uh, shit, I couldn't think of a good tranny movie.  How about I am a tranny?  No, no, no, Liddy.  Oh, Liddy.  Liddy.  Get on mic, Liddy.  We can't hear you.  All right.  Someone's reminding us about the bus driver assault. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, that's another thing we've got to play.  Well, there are a lot of little things we started talking about and then stopped for  some reason.  Well, there's another video.  I don't know if it's the same one that's shown on TV today.  Another bus driver assaulting a kid.  And the kid fighting back and it's pretty good.  This happens a lot nowadays.  There's cameras on the buses.  Yep.  You see these videos.  Some of the most fun videos you can watch are either animals killing each other, fighting  on the buses, or accidents.  Have you seen the accident one where the bus rolled over? 
[03:07:30]  No.  And because it's a camera inside the bus, on the back of the bus, it's relative to the  bus.  So you never see the bus tip over.  But you see the hair go flying up in the air and stuff.  But you see all the kids fly over to the right side of the bus and they're all  piled up on the side in a big stack.  Oh my God.  Did you guys see the cab video?  That cabbie sleeping one?  Yeah.  You talk about that.  No.  Which one?  One of the listeners said that it's a cabbie.  He has the camera in the cab.  Yes.  He falls asleep for literally like a half a second.  You just see him going. 
[03:08:00]  Boom.  And he shuts his eyes and he just wakes up and something is right there.  You can't see it.  He's just doing this.  Oh my God.  But then he gets thrown left to right in midair.  And then he just goes, and he's in the back seat with his head out the back window.  And you just hear, ugh.  I said this to him.  Oh, it's hilarious.  My leg.  Ah, it broke my fucking knee.  Hold my meter, man.  I think you can hear it from what I'm whispering.  You can hear me going, I'm gay. 
[03:08:30]  I can't tell my mom.  Oh my God.  I love cock.  I'm staying.  I'm gay.  And I only took torgasm to see if I could suck a gun.  Jesus.  I think I broke my leg.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  All right.  Here's the audio of the bus driver assaulting a kid.  This way.  This is the person of the bus.  That's the way you think.  Don't you tell me what to do. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Get up here.  Get up here.  You're in trouble.  I need a deputy out here on Cleveland Circle.  Now get up here.  Help.  Hey.  Hey.  What the fucker?  What the fucker?  Hey.  Hey. 
[03:09:30]  You better get off him.  Get off him.  Get off him.  I'm not going to go through, boy.  Get off him.  Hey.  You better get off him.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  You better not study.  You can't get my.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  You done now, boy.  You better get off.  I'm not going to go through.  I'm not going to go through.  I'm going to go through.  Please go in circle.  You're going to hit him.  Yes.  Get down.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off.  Get off. 
[03:10:00]  Try me.  Try me.  I swear to God, I'm not too bad to run up.  I'm going to go through.  Try me.  Try me.  Leave him alone.  No.  You're already by.  You're going to jail, boy.  Yeah.  Don't let me off.  Get off.  Let me off the bus.  Call that deputy.  Call the deputy.  Hurry up.  Come on.  All right, well.  Is there a video of that?  If you're the friend, leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Say, Jimmy, did he say deputies?  Yeah.  We got distracted because Eric started playing the cab video.  He found it.  It's up on foundrymusic.com and openanthony.com. 
[03:10:30]  It will be.  It will be up on the web.  Lots of stuff to check out after the show today.  We got the Bob Kelly audio ready for you so you can make bits out of that and send them  into the program.  The guy tried to, he fell asleep and it looks like he tried to get out of the way of something  when he woke up and started fishtailing.  And then he must have gotten into a spin and hit with the back passenger side of his car  into something because he just flies into the back seat.  The car flipped over.  That's grass.  Oh, the car flipped over too?  Yeah, it had to. 
[03:11:00]  That's fantastic.  He had no belt on him.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  No belt.  No belt.  You got to wear those seatbelts.  Did this guy survive?  I don't know, but you hear him at the end go, oh, something, he says something at  the end.  Oh, boy.  That looks survivable.  My leg, I broke.  He, uh, but his face, I mean, how many times have you been there, though, driving home  late at night?  Oh, please.  And just for that second, you fall asleep and you wake up, oh.  And then you're completely awake for like a minute.  Yeah.  Oh, all right, now I'm awake.  Yeah.  And then you find yourself just nodding off. 
[03:11:30]  You roll down the window.  You got to punch your leg and smack your face.  Smack your face.  Jerk off.  Take your sock off and cum in it.  Roll the windows up, put the heat up.  That makes you really wide awake.  That works.  Have a couple more beers.  Put on a Yanni CD.  Give a tranny a ride back to Jersey.  Good point, Bob.  Listen to her deep voice the whole way.  And work with tough tonight, Jimmy.  Hi, big dick daddy.  Big dick daddy.  Stay awake, baby.  Stay awake, daddy.  I know how to drive, Jerk.  You don't want us to have an accident like in the beginning of Injustice for All. 
[03:12:00]  Hmm.  No.  No, the hooker.  Hey, we got audio.  Yeah, we got audio of Britney's Chaotic Show to get to.  Just trying to clean up some business here in front of us.  Get rid of the big stack of audio we have.  Well, also, did you hear about Neil Armstrong today?  What, Opie?  One small snip for Neil Armstrong.  One giant payoff for his barber.  Haircutter Mark Sizemore gave a trim to the lunar legend last year, then sold the locker room for Neil Armstrong. 
[03:12:30]  One small snip for Neil Armstrong.  One giant payoff for his barber.  Haircutter Mark Sizemore gave a trim to the lunar legend last year, then sold the locks to a Connecticut collector for $3,000.  Three grand.  Neil doesn't have a lot of hair to begin with, though, right? 
[03:13:00]  He's probably just little clippings.  Tiny, tiny little clippings.  The move infuriated the intensely private Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon.  Really?  Armstrong, 74, is now suing to recover the hair or at least get the $3,000 donated to one of his favorite charities.  He asked me to pursue trying to get the hair back, Sizemore said.  I called the person I sold it to and told him he was not interested in giving it back.  I called Neil back and told him that.  Then I got this letter from his lawyer.  He's probably pissed at that barber. 
[03:13:30]  Who wants hair from somebody?  How much I love Ozzy, I wouldn't want his hair.  Hair?  He collects hair from famous people.  Oh, okay.  That's his, like, oh, my God, who farted.  I honestly did not.  Eric, did you fart?  Sneeze.  Come on.  No more.  I'd admit if I farted.  No more farting.  You're smelling it?  No, but I don't want to either.  I don't smell it.  Eric, that is, there's no way that's me, dude, because if it was me, I'd say it.  I swear to God, at least own up to it.  Have I ever not admitted a gasser?  No, no.  You do for two seconds. 
[03:14:00]  Don't spray by over here, because I want to.  And start smiling.  That is not Jimmy's fart.  We've smelled enough of Jimmy's farts.  I swear to God.  It was not me.  It was you.  You're turtling.  Eric.  And I don't smell it over here.  I don't smell anything.  I swear to God.  It's only you and Hawk.  You're turtling.  You have a little nervous duty.  A little nervous duty.  Eric, why can't you admit?  Just be one of the guys and just admit you farted.  Jesus.  Why didn't you admit it?  I didn't fart.  You're looking at me.  I didn't do it.  Wow.  Oh, hold on.  Get this mic going.  I think that you did it.  And Opus is saying you did it.  Go ahead. 
[03:14:30]  Quit lying.  Be a man for once.  Bob.  Yeah.  Why are you setting us all up?  Someone farted.  I didn't do it.  I know Anthony didn't.  It wasn't me.  If I did it, I'd tell you.  How did the pilot, co-pilot seat work out for you, Opi?  How did this happen?  I don't know.  Where you are now like sitting a foot and a half away from another man for the entire show.  If you were any closer, you'd be a foot.  Oh, look at that, Liddy.  Is that Liddy?  He's incorrigible.  All right, well, there's the Neil Armstrong story. 
[03:15:00]  Blam.  So we got some audio from Britney's chaotic show, Gamefly.com.  Wonderful.  We'll get to that in a second.  He allegedly screwed up his quote, by the way.  I don't know if he's admitted it or not.  Really?  But originally he had rehearsed it so many times and it was supposed to be one small step  for a man.  A man, right.  One giant leap for mankind.  Kind, and he's saying that it was just the transmissions didn't catch the uh.  The uh part.  But he just messed it up.  You think?  Yeah.  I think it works both ways.  That was on a studio.  It never happened.  I think it kind of works both ways. 
[03:15:30]  You don't need the uh in there.  You're right, but I mean.  You know.  One small step for man.  One small step for a man.  For a man.  Much better.  You think for a man is better?  Yeah, yeah.  This is one small step for a man.  One giant leap for mankind.  But it means the same thing.  One small step for a man.  Like for a man, it's small step.  You just kind of make a step.  Well, when you're referring to man without the uh, or the, you're referring to mankind.  It's like saying one small step for mankind, one giant leap for mankind.  For mankind.  It doesn't matter because we never. 
[03:16:00]  I'd rather have the lids have this conversation.  Yeah, we never made it to the moon.  We never did it.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  We never made it to the moon.  The sea rock.  The sea rock.  Because the flag, you could tell it was like blown in the wind or something.  There was some kind of gravity thing happening.  And there was also like a weird M in the back.  Yeah.  We're serving burgers.  You ever hear Cronkite screw it up?  Wow.  You just.  Oh.  That was.  Liddy.  That was mine.  Don't blame me for that, clunker.  That was fat tits.  All right, easy. 
[03:16:30]  Jesus.  You smacked Liddy like it was.  I'm talking about.  You smacked your lid.  You mind your business.  You smacked your lid to tell him to calm down and stop talking.  You mind your fucking business, especially when it concerns me and Liddy.  Concerns me.  Concerns.  Hey, watch out.  This concerns me.  Concerns.  Concerns.  You ever hear Cronkite repeat it right after he said one small step for man, one giant leap  for mankind?  He said one small step for man, one giant feet for mankind.  He did. 
[03:17:00]  He probably meant one giant.  Oh, maybe he was thinking of the mermaid baby.  Like he thought it was a feet.  Oh, no.  Not like Bigfoot.  Like a big feet.  Like it was a giant.  F-B-A-T.  A feet, yeah.  Some big accomplishment like that.  And that's what he said.  One giant.  Then he corrected himself.  Just a little tidbit of historical trivia.  Well, I heard of it.  Aristotle.  Oh, fuck.  Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I think that's a little trivial to be a professor.  Who the fuck knows that?  Except Anthony. 
[03:17:30]  Anthony knows a little bit about everything.  I love this face program.  I knew how to smell feet.  Bubbling liquid behind you in different colors.  Mr. Wizard.  Kids, did you know?  Where?  Tennessee.  F-B-A-T.  Actually, Walter Cronkite got that wrong when he first quoted it, Tennessee.  Well, Neil actually said when he got off, this is one big motherfucking step.  And he fell wrong on the moon.  He went, oh, my leg.  Oh.  I just hurt my knee, you son of a... 
[03:18:00]  How'd you hurt your knee, Bob?  I don't know.  I just popped something.  Well, you came down on it with the weight of another man, and whoopee, the leg snapped.  Mr. Whoopee, you're the greatest.  That guy, he knew everything.  Ever watch Tennessee Tuxedo with a kid, Jimmy?  I remember it, but I don't.  And they'd always have to go to Mr.  You farted just now.  All right.  Now it's getting out of hand.  Did you fart before, too?  No, I would tell you.  Just that.  You know what, dude?  You know what?  Just don't spread me with that. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Why so many farts?  It's out of control.  Whenever I get nervous, my body tenses up, and it just comes in.  It's actually fear leaving me.  I hate your farts.  Oh, God, please, yes.  I will take this.  I will spread the mic.  Bob, we're doing a radio show here.  Why don't you quit clowning around?  Get over here.  I smelled it on the mic.  So what?  You get it back over here.  Get back over here.  Why don't you be a man and talk into the mic.  Oh, my God.  It finally hit over here.  Hey, it's all out of, boys.  This one is horrific.  Way to take it off.  It's so bad. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm just fucking leaving.  Where are you going, Opie?  That's why he has no body hair.  It just burns it off.  It just burns off to the roots.  You really are like a burn victim from your ass.  Wow, Jimmy.  That's like, I can't understand what you, it's got to be all the coffee and then yogurt and  then what, oatmeal and just.  Don't forget the lawns.  And a lot of scared thoughts.  Scared thoughts.  What do you eat for dinner? 
[03:19:30]  Is it like meat?  A lot of meat?  I had dinner with my neighbor last night.  We went out and had some nice kebab.  Really?  Yeah.  Who's your neighbor?  Ha, ha.  I upgraded with neighbors.  I went from you to Ope.  Oh, you know me.  He's like a block and a half from me.  That's right.  I'm his new neighbor.  That's right.  I'm on a cell phone.  Where do you want to meet?  Meet you there.  All right.  We met in the corner in a minute and a half.  We not went to dinner.  We just took me to Starbucks.  Uh-huh.  Well.  Now we'll be watching movies together and there will be no crying.  No.  Neither one of us will get all teared up. 
[03:20:00]  That's right.  No tissues needed for movie night at Jimmy's.  Except for wiping up the load up each other's chest.  Choked up.  Frigging homos.  Oh, the devil.  That's the most disturbing face I've ever seen.  The face he made?  What the fuck is that?  That was fully committed to that.  I will say.  You did not just fart again.  No, I didn't.  I was going to say that.  No more until 11.  I can't even knock Bob for crying in certain movies.  I just don't like your mood.  All right.  Do you guys want to hear the...  What did you... 
[03:20:30]  Why?  What did you choke up over?  Cuckoo's Nest.  Cuckoo's Nest?  What, the end?  Almost every time I see it, yeah.  Yeah, that scene is sad.  It gets the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have one that I...  It's the only movie I ever, ever got a lump in my throat over and went like, oh my God,  what's happening?  Like, you don't even know what's happening?  It's like the first time you jack off.  And it's like, what the hell is happening?  It was feeling good up until this whole thing happened.  It usually comes out like a marshmallow.  Now it's all creamy.  I'm confused.  Yeah, it was one of those... 
[03:21:00]  And it was, um...  What the hell scene was it?  It was...  I already sensed myself ready to throw something at you.  Are you?  No, because it was very sad.  It was the scene where the one single tear came down Demi Moore's cheek in Ghost.  That was...  I'll tell you a much better one than that, which is the same type of a tear as Denzel  in Glory.  That was a cry scene.  When he's getting whipped and he just drops out one tear, that was that one on the Oscar. 
[03:21:30]  That I could see.  But Demi Moore's...  I'm not even going to start with the jokes.  Well, but...  Of course not.  You know what I mean.  Of course I do.  You know.  What?  Nothing.  Ghost was a chick flick.  It was...  Yeah, I mean, I could see some sad moments.  It wasn't even so...  It was just the Demi...  The Demi tear.  Oh, when she went ditto or some shit?  What the action?  I don't even know what she said.  She was making a face.  You know what she said?  They were chasing the killer for a while.  For me.  He kicked a can on the train.  I did it!  Yeah.  Don't even start making fun of my choice of movie. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, at least he doesn't have to have a life-threatening injury to cry.  He can just watch a little chick flick and drop a tear.  He doesn't have to be completely hurt and in genuine pain.  Right.  All right.  Do you guys want to hear the Britney audio?  Do we want to hear the Britney audio?  What moment did you cry at, Opie?  I want to hear what you cry at.  Yeah, what did you choke up at, Opie?  I've never cried at a movie.  I don't buy it, you blue-eyed stud.  Get a little teary.  Get a little misty. 
[03:22:30]  A little misty.  You blue-eyed stud.  I laughed through, I'll tell you the movies I laughed at, about Schmidt, I laughed through  the whole damn thing.  The whole fucking movie.  About Schmidt.  I laughed when you were-  The depressed fest.  People were crying around me and I was openly laughing really hard.  When he drives up to what he thinks is his childhood home and it's a tire store.  That was one of the biggest laughs I've ever had in a movie theater, ever. 
[03:23:00]  How about-  He's driving across country to what?  To see his daughter or whatever?  To see his daughter's wedding.  And he decides to go back to his hometown and see his house that he was brought up in  and his life has just got-  It's a tire dealership.  And now he's walking in the tire store trying to figure out where his bedroom used to be.  And nobody cares.  No one cares because they're too busy selling tires.  And I remember there were women around me just losing it and I openly laughed at the  screen.  I thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever. 
[03:23:30]  Uh, Schindler's List, you're cracking up.  We can't have-  We don't have any more room?  I cried at that one, too.  End of Saving Private Ryan.  No.  Where he said,  Tell me I was a good man.  No.  Well, that's-  I'm just reading them off of here.  I know, sweetie.  Uh, the Mr. Squidlow chokes up at the part in American History X when the guy's mouth  is on the curb.  Oh.  You fucked with the wrong bull.  Oh, my God.  Is that brutal?  That is one of the worst scenes ever.  That's a really good movie.  Wall Street was kind of sad when Charlie Sheen was talking to his dad and Martin cries in 
[03:24:00]  the-  Because he can't talk in the hospital.  That was great.  Yeah.  He was crying because his son can't act.  His son's a whore-monger.  A hong-monger.  A hong-monger.  Have Liddy say it next time.  Yeah.  Picks up a lot of girls.  All right, Liddy.  Let's go to James in Illinois.  James?  Yes, sir.  Well, Rocky found Rocky 2 in the hospital and Adrian tells Rocky to win and the theme  song comes on. 
[03:24:30]  That was the one that got me.  Really?  All right.  Yeah.  I also got a little misty when Hitler had to poison his dogs in downfall.  And he, you know.  Yeah?  Yeah, you felt bad for Hitler.  Yeah, of course you did.  You know, you're an old sap like that.  A guy kills six million people, he's got to kill a dog.  No wonder you're upset.  He had to put his shepherds down and put the little cyanide in their mouth and clamped  down on their snouts and they went like, and Hitler got a little, you know, teary.  Here's another movie I laughed at openly.  Jason in New York City. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I cried during Cast Away when Wilson floats away.  No, you did not.  I actually laughed when it turns out that Tom Hanks isn't going to get back together with  his chick there.  Yeah, that's right.  I thought that was hilarious.  Chris from Virginia, Kevin Costner at the end of Field of Dreams, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Well, what happens at the end of Field of Dreams?  He realizes that he's not a good baseball player and then he says something racist to James 
[03:25:30]  Earl Jones.  Get in the weeds.  Something.  He didn't say that.  Look at Jim.  Jim, he goes, he just looked around and went, oof.  But then Bob went, he didn't say that.  You were kidding, right?  I was kidding.  Yes.  I'm going to fight Tyson too, you jackass.  All right.  Why is Stalker Patty outside the studio?  Why haven't we played the Britney Spears audio yet?  Oh, she wants her body painted with some fake tits.  Oof.  Very funny, Jimmy. 
[03:26:00]  What droopy.  What does her body look like?  Pains her kids up with one of those little bottles they give you to paint models with.  Her body like tapers on both ends.  It's like it's fuller in the middle and then it gets narrow.  It's like a piece of shit.  All right.  Let's get Patty in here.  What's your name, shit body?  You're shaped like a piece of shit.  No shit.  No shit.  A shitty mannequin. 
[03:26:30]  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  What's with you?  Wow, you are sporting some camel toe today.  Look at her snatch.  Don't be shy.  Don't cover it.  Yeah, Patty, you stand up.  It's just tight.  Don't be shy.  You see that camel toe?  Look at her snatch.  Don't be shy, divot box.  I'm sorry.  I want to swipe my metro card through that thing.  It looks like you walked in and surprised Jack Torrance. 
[03:27:00]  That's good.  Is anybody home?  Hello?  Chocolate sells me.  Chocolate sells me.  That could be her litty.  That's what they call me.  Hey, Patty.  Stand up, Patty.  Just stand up.  I'm going to be shy.  Don't be shy.  Let's see your twat.  Let me...  Jesus.  Don't...  Wow.  Don't pull your pants...  No, no, no. 
[03:27:30]  Move that Chinese...  Be proud of that camel toe.  That's it.  I'm throwing these pants away.  Are they a little tight?  Yes.  Yeah.  Are they chick jeans?  I don't know what they are.  What kind of jeans are they?  I don't know.  They obviously don't have a place for chapstick in the pocket, do they?  Jesus, lips.  Yeah, Patty.  All I do is try it on.  If it fits, I wear it.  Yeah.  Well, that fits all right.  It should be your campaign slogan, stupid.  Right?  Your crack.  Yeah.  Wow.  So what do you got, Patty?  Yeah, what do you have?  What do you got? 
[03:28:00]  Happy belated birthday to Opie.  That's nice.  Oh, it's some chocolate.  That's not just a chocolate.  That's Godiva chocolate.  Godiva.  Some of the...  Very expensive.  Did we sing happy birthday to Opie?  No.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, Patty.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Opie.  Happy birthday to you. 
[03:28:30]  Liddy?  How old are you?  Patty.  Hold on.  Liddy?  Hold on, Patty.  Good addition.  Patty?  Yes.  What did you get me?  Well, why don't you open it up and see?  Oh, Patty.  What a tease.  What kind of chocolate did you get me?  Some of them are truffles, and there's things that are in the bottom of the box that I know  you'll like.  Speaking of bottom of the box, nice pants.  That's really nice, Patty.  Thank you.  That's really nice.  I'll give you a hint. 
[03:29:00]  Truffles and jockeys.  Chocolate-covered strawberries.  Jesus.  I just throw them on the floor.  Oh, man, they're all going to be all over the place.  I know.  I throw them in the garbage.  I don't eat chocolate anymore, but thanks anyway.  You don't.  You got it, is it?  You got it right in the garbage.  Say me happy, happy.  Thank you.  Why do I get the little box?  You got it right in the little box.  You got the little box?  You're looking right at me.  Because the big fat one's in her pants.  No.  Patty, don't sit back down.  Oh.  Stand up.  Yeah, don't be, don't be. 
[03:29:30]  Come on, who cares?  Be proud of that stink wrinkle.  Yeah.  I don't need chocolate anymore.  Wow, what are these, Patty?  They're truffles.  Those are good.  Can I have them?  They're the spring truffles, yeah.  Spring truffles?  What's the difference?  They're seasonal.  That is fucking good.  Just grab one and pass it over, Bob.  Yeah.  For God's sake, I'm fine over here.  Fuck them all, you cocksuckers.  I love these things.  Can I have one?  Grab one and pass it over.  No.  Pass it this way.  Can I have one?  Pass it this way.  God damn it. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, man.  I only want one more.  This one stinks.  These are actually good.  What kind do you want?  Good stuff.  The one by your left pointer finger.  Left.  This one?  Yeah.  This one?  No, up.  This one?  Two over.  This one?  Two other.  This one?  No.  I know he's fucking with me, but I'm such a fat appendix scar pig, but I'm playing along 
[03:30:30]  hoping you won't step on them.  There you go.  Take the two real dark chocolate ones and put them across Bob's nose so he feels at home.  Some Dominican.  All right.  Well, thank you, Patty.  That was very nice of you.  Very nice, Patty.  And, Patty, thank you for bringing me some chocolates.  The guy that appreciates them the most.  I would have paid you for a box of chocolate.  Well, I can. 
[03:31:00]  Here, you want this box that's in the garbage?  Ooh.  Why don't you open them up and at least see what they are?  Why don't you open them up?  Why don't you bring some?  I made some dessert cups for you.  Dessert cups, Opie.  Yeah, with fruit and everything in them.  Chocolate covered strawberries.  Yeah, I have that in there, too.  Wow.  Good stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  You'll never buy my love.  The devil.  That's great.  And just a great camel toe today.  Yeah.  Well, I'm two days away from mine. 
[03:31:30]  Your period?  No.  My birthday.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  The big 50.  We were supposed to get her laid.  Wow.  It's only two days?  I remember when we first started talking about this.  It was like six, seven months ago.  Wow, Patty.  You're going to be 50 in two days?  Yeah.  And never knowing the love of a man.  Should we get something going for her 50th on Friday?  Yes.  Patty, you want to get laid for your birthday?  What?  What can we get done in two days for you, Patty?  I don't want to get laid.  You want to get laid.  What do you need for your birthday besides a gallon of spackle to cover that hole? 
[03:32:00]  I've got some people taking me out for my birthday.  I don't know where they're taking me.  Yeah?  Joyce is going to take me to lunch.  Where does a girl go for her 50th birthday?  I don't know.  Joyce is going to take me for lunch and then someplace in the city shopping.  And then there's going to be some people later on we're going to meet that night.  I wonder if they can.  What kind of place do you think you're going to go to?  I have no idea.  It's going to be a party night, though.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Strip club or something.  Who are these people from work?  Well, no, no.  You know Joyce from under the console. 
[03:32:30]  Right.  Yeah, she's going to take me out.  Maybe Chippendales?  Ooh.  I don't know.  I wish.  I would love to go to a place like that.  Yeah?  I would.  You would?  You'd like to go to Chippendale?  I've always wanted to go to one of those places.  I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.  Oh, my God.  Well, I think for 50 years old, I'm in great shape.  You really are.  You've got a nice dumper, if you don't mind me saying so.  You will.  Do you want to show Bob your dumper?  Is it nice?  Considering that Patty is a disaster in a half a parenthesis, she actually does have a nice 
[03:33:00]  and set her body in shape like a piece of it.  Really?  We'll turn the camera off.  Is this a trick?  No, it's actually a nice ass.  I mean, for Patty.  I'm not even kidding you.  It's all right.  Why don't you just watch the video of Krusty the Clown?  Because I don't have the video in my house.  It's Opie's birthday, and he wants you to do that for his birthday.  I broke my homo, Opie.  You broke it.  Yeah?  He's like a bat out of hell.  The telephone cord came in like a cannonball. 
[03:33:30]  Hit me right in the pussy and split my lips apart.  Now I've got a camel toe.  All right.  Well.  Why don't you show Bob your honey?  Yeah, show Bob your honey.  Can I say it, please, Ben?  We'll turn off the camera, because we already have video there.  Turn off the camera.  Turn around so it's just your ass.  I know.  We all are.  We're not talking about your delicious meat.  Oh, don't worry about your luge chute.  You can just pull your pants down and show the back.  Remember, she's 50 in two days there, Bob.  Really?  Wow.  I fell in there.  I know.  You're following Sandy Kane, okay? 
[03:34:00]  You're going to be fine.  Trust me.  I threw up.  It's not great, but it's not as bad.  Just pull it down for Pete's sake.  All right.  Wait.  Let's see your underwear first of all.  Lift your shirt.  You've got to bend over a little.  Can you lift up your shirt and pull those off the underwear down?  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Pull the underwear down.  Tuck in those pajamas.  All right.  Now bend over.  Lift your shirt off.  Bend over.  Bend over.  We're 50.  That's not bad.  That's not a badass.  I wouldn't mind.  That's because I take care of myself.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  You have the worst underwear ever, by the way. 
[03:34:30]  Would you get those off a laundry rack in 125th Street?  No.  Pull your pants down a little bit.  Are you trying to be sexy for once for Tuesday?  Her pants are pulled up to her nipples.  No.  They are.  Patty, come on.  You're getting a little hippie, Patty.  What happened?  You eating a lot of chocolate?  No.  Patty?  I actually lost weight.  I'm 109 pounds.  Yeah, but see right there, Patty?  What?  Look.  See right there?  You're not looking at me. 
[03:35:00]  Look at me.  See right there?  Right where?  Put your hands on your hips.  Now go down.  Right there.  See right there?  Yeah.  That's getting a little hippie.  I think you're eating chocolate.  You're eating a lot of the chocolate of Godiva?  Not really.  I started drinking the elixir shakes, which reminds me that's a free coupon for an elixir  shake.  It's a free coupon.  Mike can make that for you.  For an elixir shake.  It fell off a building and landed on a telephone wire.  It's a new thing we have, you know. 
[03:35:30]  Elixir?  You know, Mike can make that for him.  That's like what a snake oil salesman sells at the back of a covered wagon in the 1800s.  He's doing Warcraft.  This elixir will grow hair and cure the vapors.  All right.  Well, Patty, we don't have anything for you today, so thanks for coming.  It heals Camuto.  Camuto.  This thing...  Oh, man.  I couldn't think of the word elixir.  How about elixir?  No, no, no.  Oh, Liddy.  Oh, pass in that mouth, Liddy. 
[03:36:00]  He's a real chatter lid.  He's grinding his teeth at you.  That means he's angry.  Now, what are you off to, Patty?  You done working, or you've got to go to work?  Well, I came from work because I had taken a shipment at 6 o'clock this morning,  and I have to go back to Earth and close.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  One show up.  While you're closing the store, how about closing between your legs?  Yeah.  Jesus.  That's open for business.  You really do have a huge camel toe. 
[03:36:30]  Just have her hold the Lysol can in there, and whoever Jim Fartre just pushed the top of it.  Well, maybe Han Solo can land the Millennium Falcon in there when they're running away from space pings.  Space pings?  From space pings.  Evil people in space.  Yeah.  Very good, Patty.  Well, thank you.  You're welcome.  I hope Opie shares some of his birthday present.  Christmas.  Where the fuck am I?  I know.  Give him his birthday present with me. 
[03:37:00]  We can skyhook in the barrel.  Oh, I'm sure you will.  Yeah, as soon as we get it out of the garbage.  Yeah.  Garbage picker.  Garbage picker.  All right, Patty.  Thank you so much.  That was wonderful.  You're welcome.  Bye, Patty.  I'll see you.  Be good.  Thank you.  Take the headphones off.  There she goes.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's do it.  All right.  Now we can't get to the Brittany audio, Anthony.  Oh, how did that happen?  Look at the time.  How does the time come play so quickly?  We also have the audio of the dude that got fired from FHM. 
[03:37:30]  That's a huge story, too.  Oh, that was in the post today.  It was the headline in page six of the post.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  I get people fired, Rob.  Well, hoo-hoo does a lot of awful things behind the scenes.  That's what a brave man does.  This is a typical thing that he did behind the scenes that we've seen done plenty of times,  and we were at the receiving end of it.  Howie likes to make it sound like he's a tough guy on the air and takes on all comers. 
[03:38:00]  And I remember years ago, he would beat up on jocks, and it was very fun to listen to and funny,  and they wouldn't fight back, or they'd try to, and it would be lame.  Those are the people Howard fights.  Anyone that has any talent or anyone that speaks the truth that upsets Howie in any way whatsoever,  that's not confronted on the air.  That is confronted behind the scenes by going to bosses or people you know and having that person dealt with off the air.  He's a hypocrite. 
[03:38:30]  Has been for years.  A lot of people don't see it because they're fans or they're just taking someone else's word for it.  You know, we've said it plenty of times, but who are we?  You know, someone's not going to take our word for it.  Well, here's just another example that actually made it into the paper of hypocrite Howie.  Howard Stern really must be the king of all media.  Just hours after he complained on air about FHM editor-at-large Jack Bronstein's assertion  that three-time FHM cover girl Beth Ostrowski is only famous because she dates Stern. 
[03:39:00]  Bronstein was fired!  You're fired!  Fired!  Fired!  Guy goes on G4 TV, I guess a show called Attack of the Show,  and they asked him about Howie's little girlfriend that's on the cover of FHM.  He says some things, and honestly, it's really no big deal what the guy said.  Howard goes on his stupid show, complains about it, and soon after, the guy is fired from his job. 
[03:39:30]  Mark my words, phone calls were made.  That's how Howie works.  That's how he operates.  The guy really didn't say anything bad.  He said that she really was a nobody before she started going out with Howard.  And she was!  Who knew who this girl was beforehand?  You know, she starts going out with Howard, she gets a name for herself, and now she's doing a lot more.  That's fine!  Was that you again, Jimmy?  No.  You farted.  Yes, you did.  Okay.  Jesus. 
[03:40:00]  Unbelievable.  We're just trying to get to the end of the show.  And whenever I see her on television, she seems like a nice enough person.  It's not like he was bad-mouthing her or anything.  There's really not anything to badmouth.  She's nice enough on TV.  Hey, but the truth of the matter is, who the fuck was she before she started going out with Howard?  So the guy was honest.  He said something like that.  And Howard didn't like it.  Bitched about it on the show.  And then what?  It's coincidence that the guy gets fired after that?  Believe me.  You want your magazine promoted on my show? 
[03:40:30]  You want Beth on your cover anymore?  You want me to talk about your magazine?  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Jimmy, we're trying to be serious here.  Holy...  I want to hear the rest of that point.  That's a very good point.  And he's sitting with his both legs up on the table like a golem.  Like a golem.  He gave birth.  He gave birth to that last fart.  His legs up.  I don't know what Anthony was saying.  You're right, dude.  What happened?  Holy shit. 
[03:41:00]  This is the only time we were trying to be serious on the show today.  Let's be serious.  And you just killed us.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what's coming out of you.  I don't know what could be bubbling in there that is making these gases.  I do.  It's kelp.  We're running out of the show, Anthony.  So basically, a lot of people are trying to get their hands on the audio.  And lawyers are getting involved and shutting down websites and stuff.  So we got the audio of the guy talking about how he's a girlfriend.  Yeah.  Listen if this is a firing offense. 
[03:41:30]  Tell me about this month's issue.  What can we find?  This month's issue has our entertainment guide.  But more importantly, it has the lovely Beth Ostrowski on the cover.  Who?  I'm sorry?  Wait.  No, here you go.  Here's the qualifier.  Who is it?  She is Howard Stern's girlfriend.  There we go.  There we go.  Making her third appearance.  And actually, she outsells people like Holly Berry when she appears on our cover.  Wow.  So she has some pool then.  She does, yeah.  Now, the question is, did anybody know about Beth O before she became Howard Stern's girlfriend?  Nobody knew about Beth O before she became Howard Stern's girlfriend. 
[03:42:00]  Ah, so that was a good move on her part.  It was a good move.  So when you do, because you do write-ups on the girls, you know, when you have pictures  and I believe there's text, which is why I buy it.  Sure.  The articles.  Elegant writing.  Yeah.  You've got some great writers.  Sure.  So what do you ask her?  Do you say, so what's it like being Howard Stern's girlfriend or do you have to pretend  that you care about, you know, what her favorite foods are?  Well, the first time around, because she's been on three times, you're, it's a delicate  situation.  Right.  Because you definitely want to know about Howard, but you're kind of like, so what do you think 
[03:42:30]  of Howard?  Right.  You know, what do you think Howard's favorite foods are?  Exactly.  But by number two, you just keep it real.  You're like, so what's the big guy up to now?  And damn, you're hot.  Gotcha.  And then by number three, actually, she is, she said this time around she didn't even want  to be interviewed.  She interviewed herself.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And not a bad spread there.  Where was this one shot?  Do you know?  This one is Florida, I believe.  Very nice.  Somewhere.  There you have it.  Nothing. 
[03:43:00]  There was really nothing there.  He was answering the guy's questions.  The guy's the one that was saying.  The guy was really the instigator.  Yeah, he's just going, yeah, good move.  And he was like, you know, who was she?  Well, she was nobody.  The guy was just being honest, answered it honestly.  Yeah.  Not really trying to attack anybody.  And Howard complained on the show.  And soon after, the guy was fired.  And the guy's fired.  But that's how this guy works.  We've said it for years.  Tell him, Fred.  Said it for years.  That was so not a dick thing the guy said.  Yeah.  Of course not.  And Howie, you know, makes some calls, I guess. 
[03:43:30]  And the guy gets the boot.  That's how the hypocrite Howie works.  All behind the scenes.  All right, Bob.  We'll get to you.  Bob Kelly.  All right.  I really did huff and puff.  Anything to plug?  I have a heartburn.  Anything to plug?  Yeah, I'm going to be at Nick's Comedy Stop in Columns and Saugust in Boston, the 17th and 18th of June.  All right.  And the audio's up online.  Have fun with it and send in your projects.  And I'll be performing.  Program complete. </pre>
