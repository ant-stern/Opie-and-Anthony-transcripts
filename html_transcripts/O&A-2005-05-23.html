<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a comedic evisceration of Rosie O'Donnell's performance in "Riding the Bus with My Sister."  Comedian Bill Burr was a guest, joining Opie and Anthony in relentlessly mocking O'Donnell's portrayal of a mentally handicapped woman, using derogatory terms like "retard" repeatedly.  They dissected clips from the movie and an interview, focusing on what they considered poor acting and stereotypical representation.  The discussion veered into a story about a previous guest with Down syndrome, Corky, and included commentary on O'Donnell's online photos. Listener calls added to the comedic critique, speculating on the movie's plot and offering their own offensive jokes.

The show continued with more merciless mockery of a low-budget film featuring an "overweight, retarded" female protagonist named Rosie and her "retarded black boyfriend," Jesse.  The hosts and callers employed numerous offensive terms while dissecting the film's plot, characters, and acting.  Specific scenes involving Rosie's loud walking, family drama, and interactions with other passengers were highlighted, along with the film's frequent fat jokes and intolerance.  A significant portion then transitioned to a discussion of "After School Specials," with callers recalling and humorously critiquing various plots and characters from these programs, often with offensive commentary, focusing on topics like drug use, teen pregnancy, sexual abuse, and eating disorders.  A caller also shared a humorous, albeit offensive, story about his mother-in-law.

Tracy Morgan then joined the show.  His segment began with sexually explicit conversations about masturbation, his son's masturbatory habits, and his own prolific sexual history.  He recounted anecdotes from his life, including a celebrity softball game where he pitched in his underwear, a shoving match at a club, and an offensive account of a planned trip to Harlem.  He also made offensive comments about Whitney Houston and Bridget Nielsen.  A clip of Mike Brady from "The Brady Bunch" discussing his first kiss was played, followed by further offensive commentary.  The conversation touched upon a celebrity golf tournament, Benoit Benjamin's testimony against Jason Williams, and a hypothetical scenario involving the Harlem Globetrotters and cocaine.  A call from Colin Cosell (Howard Cosell's grandson) recounted a story about Morgan showing pornography to an intern at *Saturday Night Live*.  Morgan also discussed his time at *Saturday Night Live*, his cancelled TV show, controversial comments about the showâ€™s treatment of black talent,  his work on a "comedian's anti-doping committee", and the Michael Jackson trial (including speculation involving Bubbles). A caller inquired about purchasing steaks from Morgan's "meat man" character, leading to a discussion of his friend "Spoonie Love" and the invention of the term "pop-off."  Dee Dee, another guest, then shared a bizarre story about waking up married to a British man in Las Vegas after a drug and alcohol-fueled blackout, only to discover his money was counterfeit. The hosts delved into the details of her experience.  The show concluded with a "Hi, Mom" prank call segment, a humorous description of a fictional "Opie and Anthony's Funhouse" radio segment, and post-show chatter between Patrice O'Neal and Vinny Brand, featuring a heated but friendly argument.


The next segment featured a chaotic discussion primarily centered around Patrice O'Neal's upcoming performance at Vinny Rand's Stress Factor club, filled with insults and crude jokes.  A significant portion focused on a conflict between Patrice and Vinny concerning ticket sales and the quality of Vinny's restaurant food (described with highly offensive terms). Patrice criticized the club's lack of black patrons and made racist remarks.  Anthony was dealing with post-dental procedure numbness and pain.  The hosts and Vinny repeatedly insulted each other.  Vinny Rand was a guest, along with country singer Travis Tritt, who joined later.  The conversation shifted to Tritt's career, including anecdotes about early struggles, fans throwing quarters onstage during "Here's a Quarter," and his relationships with other country stars.  A contentious relationship between a radio personality "Voss" and his girlfriend Bonnie was also discussed with vulgar and disparaging comments.  The segment included further off-color jokes about comedians and a mention of a previous Travis Tritt interview on other XM channels.


The final segment featured Travis Tritt recounting positive experiences working with Ray Charles, including a phone number and friendship. He praised Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning performance in *Ray*.  He shared his experience filming *Blues Brothers 2000*, expressing awe at working with musical legends like Eric Clapton, B.B. King, and Jimmy Vaughan, contrasting this with a negative experience with Yoko Ono at a Rolling Stones' Rock and Roll Circus.  A caller asked about a supposed feud with Alan Jackson, which Tritt denied, clarifying that the controversy likely involved Billy Ray Cyrus and Tritt's dislike of "Achy Breaky Heart." The segment concluded with a series of sexually explicit and vulgar voicemails.

[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:00]  It's live tomorrow at 7 a.m. on the East Coast. 
[00:04:30]  But in the meantime, we're going to give you a few bits that we love, we like a lot.  This ought to hold the little fuckers for a while.  And Bill Burr is still here.  And Bill Burr is still here.  I don't even get why.  I don't know.  But he's a friend, but he's a friend, but he's a friend, and we like when he stops by on an announce.  No, it's Monday.  It's Monday.  No, it's Tuesday morning.  I'm going to blow the lid off this.  Yeah.  This scandal.  This ruse.  Yeah.  Bill was on the show about a week ago, and here he is helping us out with this. 
[00:05:00]  Rosie the Retard, Anthony.  Yes.  Remember Rosie O'Donnell was in that Hallmark movie playing a woman with mental handicap?  Riding the bus or something like that?  Riding the bus with my sister.  Sponsored by Hallmark.  Ick.  Yeah.  She talks about her role on the Danza show, and we get a little preview of her retarded  character acting.  Oh, wait.  This is not...  Okay, this is not after the actual movie.  This is actually before.  This is before. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, this is going to be a part two to this bit.  This is when we were first on to it and going, ah, there's something here.  We poked fun at it?  I don't remember.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think we might have poked a bit of fun at it.  Good nature, though, I hope.  If you get a chuckle out of part one, stick around for part two, because it's very, very  funny.  But first, Rosie the Retard, part one.  Pishoo, pishoo, pishoo.  Lasers, you know?  Nice, right?  Yeah.  That worked.  All right.  The worst of Mokie and Anthony.  I know. 
[00:06:00]  What do we, ah, you want to do the Rosie O'Donnell clips?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  From Tony Danza yesterday?  Of course.  There's an ad right here with her picture, riding the bus with my sister, and it's just,  just, it makes me angry.  The ad itself is a Forrest Gump-looking rip-off thing.  They have her sitting on a park bench, a bus bench, whatever it is, with the, like, clouds  in the background, the same type of Forrest Gump look.  I guess she's going for her Emmy.  Is that what this is?  I was hoping for an Emmy.  Anybody that plays a retard on a TV movie is really gunning for that Emmy. 
[00:06:30]  Yep.  Had her on Tony Danza yesterday.  Somebody on one of the message boards popped up a website also.  She has a photo website.  You know how people have photo websites?  You can post your pictures of your vacations or family get-togethers or whatever it is.  She has one of those.  And I went to it, and it's just her, like, if one of her girlfriend there and her laying  in bed together, a picture of a girlfriend's face looking all like they just woke up in  the morning, picture Rosie's face on the pillow. 
[00:07:00]  Rosie's a big, fat mess, but she did well for herself.  Yeah, she didn't look that bad at all.  I mean, her chick.  I mean, if you're going to be a lesbian, I mean, she did all right, man.  She did all right.  And then she's got her pictures of her kids on vacation.  It's like, she's just got this need, I guess, to open her life up to the public like that.  Like, out of nowhere, all of a sudden, she came out of the closet.  Now, everything.  Look at these pictures.  They're just like anyone's pictures that would be online.  What kind of an idiot would put their pictures all over the...  And she writes all personal stuff in her blog. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, right.  Whoa, what kind of idiot would do that?  Yeah, man.  Her...  See, look at the picture.  There's the two of them in bed.  Where?  Where's the bed picture?  That was it.  That's the one?  The bed.  No, back up.  Back up, Eric.  Walk back.  Down.  Yeah, right there.  The two next to each other.  You see Rosie's on the pillow or something.  That's creepy, yeah.  She's kind of a porter.  Oh, yeah.  Her girlfriend's a porter.  Wasn't she...  No, that's not her...  That's her other friend.  That's not the one she's sleeping with. 
[00:08:00]  That's the chick...  I hate to admit this, but I...  You know who that is?  Yeah, she used to work on the Rosie O'Donnell show.  What, faggot?  I know, I know.  I know.  That's really bad.  Which is the one that she's...  Which one is she...  That one right there.  Yeah.  The much thinner one.  Yeah, it says, us in L.A.  That's her.  Us.  She's a hot little blonde.  If you keep going, I think there's better pictures of her.  Yeah.  But she was on Tony Danzy yesterday.  Plugging her show.  Her movie.  And I...  I have been a fan over the years of made-for-TV retard movies. 
[00:08:30]  I love them.  Can't get enough watching people try to act retarded.  And like Jimmy has said in the past, for some reason that's totally acceptable.  It's fine.  People watch.  They do little goofy things.  There's always these comic moments where they're screwing something up in a retarded way.  And the audience laughs along.  And that's fine.  Right.  But Jimmy gets on stage and does a retard joke.  And, you know, you're the Antichrist.  You suck.  You stink.  You should burn in hell.  Do a cute little reference about like, yeah, hey, there's a retarded person. 
[00:09:00]  Let's pick up a stick and molest it.  So what?  The lacrosse team wants to do a little...  Have a little fun with her.  Yeah, so what?  They throw milk bunny on her chest and they're finished.  There's no skill in acting retarded, too.  None.  None whatsoever.  None.  We've all done it our whole, you know, our whole lives.  Why is it looked at like this big acting challenge that is so amazing when they do? 
[00:09:30]  It's the easiest thing to do.  They all put on the stupid retard voice and walk around stupid.  Tom Hanks and Forrest Gump, he did a good job.  Ben has been doing it for years.  You've got to give him credit.  But a lot of these other movies that come out, I'm just reminded of being in high school with my friends.  And we all did the retard voice and stuff, right?  I want to be like a normal person.  There, give me a fucking Emmy.  If Rosie wants to win an Emmy, she should act thin.  That would be impressive.  Act thin and act like you love dick. 
[00:10:00]  Who's the thin chick with the cock in her hand?  That's Rosie.  Give her an award.  It's amazing.  So she's got this movie.  It's coming out Sunday.  Do we have the Corky CD?  We've got to get the Corky CD.  Corky.  Oh, Corky.  Singing Poison Ivy.  Now that guy should win an award.  Because that's a real retard acting in a TV series.  How they got him to do anything is amazing. 
[00:10:30]  You see some of these guys, they're just banging their heads.  Going crazy.  And they actually, you know, you follow direction.  Well, I bet you, if you look behind the scenes, right off camera, there's the director and his parents holding cow prods.  It's like, if he didn't say his lines right, he got a good shoulder and a fat thigh.  Gave him a teaching.  We've been a real Corky over the years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You, um, I remember I was at the studio at BAB once.  And it had a door with a little glass window in it. 
[00:11:00]  A little glass window.  I'm so proud of you that you remember this one.  Oh, this one was a shining moment.  And this guy is peeking in the window.  He looks in the window.  And obviously...  And he's just like, ah!  He has Down syndrome.  And Opie points at the window.  He goes, hey, look, Corky's at the window.  Joking.  Because we start laughing.  Yeah, because that's what...  Every time you see a retard, you go, hey, Corky.  It's Corky.  And, um, lo and behold, it was Corky.  He was there to do an interview. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't know it at the time, though.  I really didn't.  But what are you supposed to do?  So, we invited him in, and, uh...  It was just awful radio for five or ten minutes.  You do have a similar look.  You know.  Was he nice?  Actually, he was really cool.  I gotta admit.  You didn't ask about the script or the plot lines.  Do you like cookies?  That was pretty much it.  Blow a pinwheel in front of his face for 15 minutes and then send him on his way.  Ooh!  He was doing a children's CD at the time. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Remember the creepy guys that were, you know, his handlers or whatever you want to call them?  Weren't they following him around?  A couple of musicians that, um, took him under, under their wing and, and had him singing songs?  Oof.  That was another thing.  Two guys decided they were gonna hook up with Corky and, um, have him sing on their, uh, on their CD.  It was just awful.  What were they doing?  Songs like Poison Ivy?  Yeah.  We used to have the CD, but it's like, Poison Ivy comes a creepin' when you're, 
[00:12:30]  Hey, you're bad at baby!  They could just throw in this bad line every so often.  Ooh.  Then they took him to Romania and put a little hat on him and made him dance to make tourists happy.  With a muzzle on so it doesn't bite anybody.  Or talk and ruin your day.  What?  What is he talking about?  What the hell is he talking about?  That's funny.  He's a great idiot.  All right, so we got some clips.  Tony Danza and Rosie O'Donnell talking here. 
[00:13:00]  A retard.  Yeah.  Here's like an intro clip.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love.  Yeah.  And Andy McDowell's in the picture.  And, um, and, you know, uh, it's Rosie playing a, uh, a special person.  Yeah.  Ah!  And.  Ah!  Ah!  Retard!  Playing a special person.  Ugh.  You know Tony Danza's like,  Hey, you're just playing a fucking retard, you know?  Yeah.  A special person.  I can't wait until she thanks him for being the inspiration in the film. 
[00:13:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Hey, you're welcome, all right?  Uh, jackass.  Tony's hungry today.  People just sound stupid and uncomfortable when they're trying to be politically correct.  A special person.  He sounded completely uncomfortable.  Playing a, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a dumb, uh, a special person.  Special person.  What does that mean?  It's not special!  I understand you want to say they're special.  If you're the parent of a, a mentally disabled child, I'm sure you want to say they're special. 
[00:14:00]  They're not special.  They, they got a problem.  They, something happened.  Why is it only in that case where something that's not good is special?  Right.  Special is always good.  Oh, look, my special girl.  Right.  Oh, look at that special, special, uh, gift I got.  Yeah.  It's very special.  Look at my special child.  Oh, the boy's an honor roll.  You're doing an HBO special.  That's right.  It's special. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, and there it kind of fits in.  Ha ha ha ha.  Yeah, but when it's bad, you know, because, uh, your kid, your kid came out, uh, with a  couple of chromosomes.  There's a lot of people out there that would say that's not a bad thing, that they had a  special kid.  Really?  Yes.  Ooh.  That it has enriched their lives.  Oh, I know what they got.  Whatever gets you through the day, I understand.  Whatever you got to pump through your mind to make it, so you don't jump out the window.  I understand.  I understand why you say special. 
[00:15:00]  We all like lemonade, don't we?  Mm-hmm.  Because if you don't say special, you'll lose your mind looking at the kid next door that  came out perfect and plays baseball.  Yeah.  And doesn't try to eat it.  Ha ha ha ha.  I understand.  Believe me.  But it's not special.  And hearing Tony Danza say special, you could just hear it in his voice.  It's uncomfortable and not natural.  And you don't have to say, hey, look, I hear you're playing a dummy.  But he could have said it like, uh, hey, Rosie's playing a retarded person. 
[00:15:30]  There's nothing degrading about saying retarded person.  Growth, your growth mentally has been retarded.  Retarded.  That's what it is.  Your growth has been, like, well, in that case, it should be a stopped person.  Because retarded implies that there's still some growth there.  So you're reversed.  Yeah, but they don't like retarded because it implies that there's no room for growth  there.  That they don't have the potential.  And of course, they're special and do have the potential.  They're not retarded.  That they are advancing on it. 
[00:16:00]  Retarded.  Say retarded.  Everybody knows.  All right.  So getting back to the clip, Tony Danza, starting to talk about the movie with Rosie O'Donnell.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love.  So, and Andy McDowell's in the picture.  And, you know, it's Rosie playing a special person.  And I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is.  As...  All right. 
[00:16:30]  Who heard that?  I heard it.  You guys heard it, right?  Okay.  Fat housewife.  Oh.  Oh.  Look how dear she looks.  Oh.  She's sitting there on a...  She's wearing light blue shorts.  And one blue sneaker and one pink sneaker and socks.  She's her own girl.  She sure is.  Yeah.  She dresses herself.  And she has fat legs with no bend marks on them.  And it bothers me.  Old clay legs.  So, they show the picture to the audience. 
[00:17:00]  And you hear one lady.  We backed up.  Go, oh.  Oh.  What's the reaction should have been from the crowd?  Ah!  Ugh.  Ugh.  Oof.  Or, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, hysterical laughter.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, it just shows me there's a whole section of society I just don't get.  Oof.  I just don't get it.  Yeah.  If you're awing this picture, just shoot yourself, please.  Oh. 
[00:17:30]  And here, I have a picture.  First of all, here's the character.  Look at this.  Here she is as Beth.  And I was knocked out, Rose.  I really, I was, you know, first of all, this is a risky job.  You take this job, you go, this is either they're going to tell me what am I thinking or the other way.  I think you've done the other thing.  It's a, it's an incredible love story about siblings, first of all, which I love.  And, um, let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be familiar.  He's a fucking dummy. 
[00:18:00]  It's an incredible love story between siblings, which I love.  I love to Sibyl.  I do that a lot.  I enjoy it.  The art of Sibyling.  What a retard.  He's a retard.  Ugh.  Trying to sell this like it's a big challenge, you know, taking a chance to.  No, it isn't.  What else is Rosie doing?  And her dopey audience will eat this up.  Just lap this crap up. 
[00:18:30]  She's wearing a hat that she stole from the set of Blossom.  Wearing like a My Little Pony t-shirt.  She's got Harpo Marks hair.  Yes.  What a wreck.  Stereotyping.  And this is, I swear to you, it is so stereotyping retards.  It is.  It's a stereotype of a retard.  The voice she does.  Her mannerisms.  It's not like she's a great actress and studied retards and, you know, got every detail down.  This is her, back in Comac in high school, goofing on a retard. 
[00:19:00]  It's pretty much what she's doing.  And they're filming it.  She probably had the same character during Powderpuff.  Yeah.  Did you guys have Powderpuff in your high school?  Where you do goofy skits for the rest of the school?  It was called the talent show.  For some reason they called it Powderpuff.  At Harborfield?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Awful.  I know.  Powderpuff.  Powderpuff.  Why would they call it Powderpuff?  I have no idea, man. 
[00:19:30]  How gay is it?  Well, who put it on?  The drama department?  Well, the skits were pretty, yeah, the skits were pretty gay.  Powderpuff.  It was pretty gay.  It was pretty awful.  It was pretty stupid.  There is not one drama department in one school anywhere in the world that is not run by gay people.  Not that there's anything wrong with it.  That's right.  Yes.  Powderpuff.  Oof.  When I was a little boy, I was in the school play, and I only had one, like a couple lines.  I don't remember them, but it was about a boy who was dirty, and I said, maybe we should have him dry cleaned. 
[00:20:00]  That was my acting line.  Did people laugh?  I don't remember.  I was so scared.  I stunk.  What play was it?  I don't know.  Did you have poopy in your pants?  I'm sure I did afterwards.  Little rusty drawers.  Flat and shite.  Flattened from nervous boys sitting in it.  Maybe we should have him dry cleaned.  Maybe you should be dry cleaned.  You stink.  I crap myself.  All right.  Back to the clip here, guys.  About siblings, first of all, which I love. 
[00:20:30]  And let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to this.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  No, not Britney.  I'm so bad.  And you're a dog.  I'm a retard.  I'm on the bus.  La, la, la, la.  I'm on the bus.  She's doing fucking Pee-wee Herman.  What is that?  Good morning, Mr. Blackface.  What was that? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, God damn it.  And Tony Dance is giving her props.  Yeah.  This is amazing.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's hear a little more.  Let me show you a clip of this.  Let me show you a clip of this so I can be forward to this.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  Ha ha! No, not Brittany.  I'm Cole Best, and you're a adult, and you're new. 
[00:21:30]  How do you know my name?  You're new, because I know everything.  Ha ha! Listen, you have to stop on Calden Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen-up leg,  and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So stop on Calden Street, Rudolpho,  and listen to me, because I only tell you two times.  That's it. Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Backfest! 
[00:22:00]  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  I pity the boy fool who don't eat my cereal!  Goddamn, was that funny?  It's the same glimpse!  Wait, I've got to compare these though.  Stop!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  What a mess! 
[00:22:30]  It's the same!  She's doing pee-wee!  I would love to talk to the crew of this movie.  That way, that scene was hysterical.  No, the movie.  Wait.  Where you're doing the Mr. Cheese cereal.  I pity the boy fool!  Play that clip again, and then we'll play the Rosie,  the first part of the Rosie clip.  Morning, Mr. Backfest!  Ha ha!  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the boy fool who don't eat my cereal!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, what is this? 
[00:23:00]  Britney Spears?  Ha ha!  No!  Not Britney!  Ha ha ha!  And you're a Redolfo, and you're new!  How'd you know my name?  You're new!  Cause I know everything!  Ha ha!  Listen!  I'd like to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because  Miss Pack has a swollen-up leg,  and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So, stop on Carlton Street,  Rudolfo, and listen to me,  because I only tell you two times!  That's it!  Then you're on your own! 
[00:23:30]  Morning, Mr. Backfest!  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the boy fool who don't eat my cereal!  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Great!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Her great acting job as a retard  is Pee-wee Herman.  She's ripping off Pee-wee.  Hoo-hoo!  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  Where's the bus gonna stop?  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, my God! 
[00:24:00]  Look who's on the bus!  Cover Curtis!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I can't wait, kiddin'!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Captain Carl!  Captain Carl!  Here comes Mr. Vod, Captain Carl!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ah!  Unbelievable!  It's Pee-wee!  It's Pee-wee Herman!  I bet you, too.  I haven't seen the clip that she's not getting on a short bus.  No.  It's a regular bus, yeah.  It's a regular, like, city bus.  Oh, city bus.  Okay.  I wasn't sure if she was getting picked up for school or something.  Oh, my God.  I do like the fact that the driver scolds her. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  It's not a stop!  Not a bus stop, ya tard!  That would be worth it if everyone in the movie talked to her like that, no matter what  she said.  No, it's not!  No, it's not, dummy.  Good try!  I'm sure you'd have that little chit-chat if that happened in New York City with one of  these New York City bus drivers.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure he would be just as polite.  You know what you'd hear?  Pshhh!  Qurrr!  Qurrr!  Qurrr!  Qurrr!  Shut up!  Shut up and sit down. 
[00:25:00]  I'm awake.  We have to stop!  We have to stop it!  The other stop is...  No, we just shut up!  Shut up!  Sit in your seat or I'll throw your dumb ass off.  Right.  There's no chit-chatting going on.  Chitting and chatting.  Shut up!  You and your fat stretch Armstrong legs.  No bend marks.  No bend marks at all.  Not even a dimple.  So what do you think is going to happen to Rosie in this movie?  We should take bets.  Oh, how does it go?  You know, there's going to be that dramatic moment where maybe she gets lost or something,  and now she's all confused looking at the big buildings. 
[00:25:30]  That's definitely going to be insane.  Where she gets lost.  Gets lost, starts looking at the big buildings,  and eventually I bet you they find her at the end and everything's going to be okay.  I think that's just a sub thing.  I think the whole thing is going to be the fact that somebody will think that she's not capable of doing something.  Maybe even her sister will think that there's some kind of shortcomings because of her being a retard,  but then she will show everybody that she is indeed capable and inspire people. 
[00:26:00]  I think what's going to happen is that Rosie doesn't know how to express herself,  and they're going to wander through the whole movie,  why does she buy tacos and then just rub her face in them and go,  It's going to be a story of inspiration.  Maybe the other sister, Annie McDowell, has some kind of illness.  Ah, maybe. 
[00:26:30]  They don't work.  Oh, I'm trying to use the phone!  That's when she's at a pay phone, I think.  Oh, these are more clips of Rosie.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, these are more clips.  I thought we only had the one.  And then I guess she gets into an exchange about who the bus driver is,  and the bus driver doesn't know who she is.  I know you are, but what am I?  That didn't make sense.  I meant to do that.  Okay!  There you go.  Okay!  And she has some fun in the movie, too. 
[00:27:00]  Then she can't really hear the bus driver, I guess, at one point.  Well!  Well!  I cannot wait to see this movie, by the way.  Dude, I can't wait for this show.  For how I'm bashing this, cannot wait to see it.  I just want to know what the conflict's going to be.  There's going to be some stupid conflict.  Yeah.  Dumb conflict. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  All right.  It can't just be her riding the bus the whole movie, can it?  No.  That would be perfect.  I hope there's a little problem.  I hope there's something.  Does she do a crying scene, you think?  You think there's a retarded crying scene in it?  No, but I'm sure Bob Kelly will be crying when he watches the movie.  Him and his bum leg.  Jesus.  That's right.  You know, it's so sweet, the siblings, and I love that.  Blubbering Gimp will be on the couch eating ho-hos, just going through tissues.  We're halfway through this scene. 
[00:28:00]  Dennis Hopper's going to call.  There's a retard on the bus.  If you don't hand over the money, I'll have her talk until everybody kills himself.  Okay.  Did they chat a little after the clip?  Yeah, yeah.  We got that.  Here it is.  Here it is.  The fake laugh.  And then he laughs like a retard.  Yeah, this is where it picks up right after the clip plays, obviously.  They're going back to Tony live.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:28:30]  Sweet.  Very sweet.  Don't feel out, man.  Yeah.  I haven't been able to watch it.  You haven't watched it?  No.  I watched some of the early cuts when Angelica was putting it together, and honestly, all  credit of this movie belongs to her.  That woman is not only the best actor we have in America, but she's an amazing director.  And I had to cry a lot of this.  I was very scared of playing a role that's so challenging.  And she made it easy.  Let me just give you a minute.  This is a kid who, her life becomes whole when she starts riding the bus. 
[00:29:00]  All the buses.  She has all the bus drivers, all the passengers.  She knows everybody and everything about them.  Right.  And that's sort of all she does.  She has a form of mental retardation.  She falls somewhere in the autism spectrum.  And she will only do the bus.  When the buses are off on Sunday, she just waits at home until the bus is, she's the first  one at the stop every time she tells people who's been on, who's been off, and she knows  everything there is to know about the buses.  Did you meet the real Beth, or? 
[00:29:30]  You know, I didn't.  But she's a real person.  She sure is.  And her sister, Rachel, takes care of her.  And Rachel sort of felt it would be very disruptive for Beth to meet new people.  And so I didn't meet her.  But I have a friend who has a sister named Cynthia, who is very much like Beth, only instead  of the buses, she loves Broadway.  So she knows everything about Broadway, what show was on where, and what theater on what  day.  And so I went to see a few shows with Cynthia.  And a lot of my character is based on Cynthia, as well as a tape that I saw of Beth. 
[00:30:00]  But I never did get to meet her, although her whole dream of her life is to go to Disney  World.  So when the movie wrapped, I got her four tickets on the sleeper bus, the Greyhound bus, to  go to Disney World.  Yeah, she'll meet new people.  Right, she'll meet people on the bus, is what I thought.  I hope it ends up on the side of a ditch on 95.  You know, they have to wait until she's in a place where she understands that she's going  to go, and her therapist will go with her.  But I hope she gets to do that.  I wonder if they put her on the bus so the fucking dummy didn't charge the cockpit. 
[00:30:30]  Put her on a bus.  That's great.  That's great for the poor minimum wage Disney employees down there having to deal with that.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Thank you, Rosie.  A sleeper bus.  You're just a wonderful American.  You always do the right thing.  I got to tell you.  Like it's not bad enough to be on a bus either, you know?  To be on a bus, and this nut's got to be on there.  Oh, little kid at Disney. 
[00:31:00]  Mommy, who's wearing the dumbbell costume?  Now, now.  Now, now.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, that ain't good.  Oh, that bugged me.  What a method actress.  Yeah, I watched the tape.  Way to throw yourself into the role, fatso.  Didn't even meet the girl.  I guess she would have been, like she said, to, which only goes to show you, she's probably  eight billion times more crazy in real life than Rosie's playing her up to be.  Rosie's going to play her up to be, you know, oh, look how sweet, and look how functional, 
[00:31:30]  and she should have got ready for the role by sniffing glue.  Before every take, just put that bag up to your mouth, paint, glue, paint thinner.  Jesus, De Niro would have done it.  Hey, how did you prepare for the role?  Well, I crawled into my mother's womb, and I had her drink.  Big bag of lead paint chips, just chowing down. 
[00:32:00]  Seeing some stupid movie, making believe it's popcorn.  Oh, cutting her own oxygen off for way longer than she should.  And when I start to black out, take the bag off my head.  Hey, you know, De Niro would have done it that way.  Right. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone knows what he did to get ready for the Raging Bull.  That's a real actor.  That is a real actor.  Look at this, she watches a tape of a retard, and she's got it down.  Goes to a Broadway show with someone who just ruins the play for everyone.  Right.  Why is that person doing that?  Oh, just the shushes that must have been going on.  And that's pretty.  That dress is up.  Shh.  Shut up.  Dolt. 
[00:33:00]  Imagine getting stuck behind that head.  Big, giant head.  Can't see the set.  I had to wait a year to get these tickets.  Anything.  Anything.  Daytime hack just gets front row.  Oh.  Steve C's there.  I really, I just wanted to say, I thought you did a wonderful job.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Could you cut some liners for us?  Steve C's a big Broadway fan.  No, is he really?  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Goes to a lot of shows.  He doesn't.  Yes, he does.  Let's go to Zach.  Yo.  Come on, Zach.  Hey, I know the dramatic event in Rosie's movie.  Huh.  Bob Kelly's going to take her to the basement and hold a rock over her again until she puts  out.  Bunch it out, boys.  Have a good one.  You know.  What are you doing?  Ha ha.  I'm being gang banged.  Ha ha ha.  We haven't explored this emotional side of Bob Kelly.  We have to call him and see if this is the type of movie he would cry over. 
[00:34:00]  Hmm.  If he knows that we're all looking, he probably wouldn't.  Yeah.  Because he'd fight it, but alone on his couch.  If he was home alone, he'd be blubbering.  With that dumb leg up, smoking a cigarette.  Dude, Bob will do this.  This is what Bob does.  He rehearses what he's going to say.  This is what a bore Bob is, and I hope you're listening, stupid.  You'll show up, and he'll just sit down, and he'll be like, you know what, dude?  And he'll just start talking, and it's like, you rehearsing motherfucker.  Don't have these.  He rehearses, like, just conversation.  He, Bob wants to be smart, and he'll walk around the house, and he'll just go, you know,  dude, I, I, and he'll, like, pontificate and sound smart to him, because he's an idiot. 
[00:34:30]  And then you sit down, and you're like, you are fucking, what is this droll nonsense?  You're firing at me.  You're looking at the government.  Shut up.  Ha ha ha.  Shut your mouth.  Ha ha.  We've got to get Bob Kelly on today.  Ben's listening.  He'll try to get it.  I want to punch him right in his bad knee.  Right in that ripped tendon.  I want to just drill my fist.  You're calling him good.  Waylon from Georgia.  Yes, sir.  I have a little thing. 
[00:35:00]  I say we hang her, then we, then we scare her, then we run her over.  I'm not even going to wait for him to finish.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was doing a lot.  All right.  Pat from Boston.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I think on the bus, she's going to get her period, and her sister's going to show how  to put on a pad, and then everything will be okay.  The pad.  She's pushing out.  Now, make sure you roll it up in tissue paper and put it in the nearest waste paper basket. 
[00:35:30]  And wave it in the bus driver's face.  Just slap him in the face with it.  Blindside him.  While you're putting your fare in, just pull out your used pad and whack him in the face  with it.  And we'll see what kind of patience the bus driver really has.  Smack it over his mouth in a mock kidnapping.  Joe from Chicago.  What's cracking, boys?  What's up, Joe?  What's cracking?  I've been listening to you guys for about two weeks now.  I am infected.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you, Joe.  Oh, isn't it me? 
[00:36:00]  Those roses look like I have a retard already.  Rosie.  I don't know if y'all already have Down syndrome.  She kind of has that look, the big fat head.  They had to keep stopping her going, look, could you look a little smarter?  You know, this girl isn't really this stupid.  I think, uh...  The only good ending for this movie would be if she gets hit by a bus.  That's the ironic ending.  Yeah, go for the ironic ending.  She actually gets hit by a bus.  The bus runs over her retard head and breaks its axle.  And she survives. 
[00:36:30]  You see that big thing pull away.  What happened?  What an annoyance.  You're trying to go to work, read the Times.  Dang, tell us, oh, shut your face.  Ugh. 
[00:37:00]  Alice, some retard got on my bus today.  Just yapping.  Yapping, yapping, yapping.  Big head takes up that whole mirror that they get to look in the backseat with.  You move that fat thing.  You private dust.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  You're a retard.  Oh, holy crap.  Clear the field, some men are going to drive some retards around. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, stupid.  A mere bag of chromosomes?  Just wish I could do the voice.  I don't even have, I don't do the voice.  Gee, I never knew Davy Crockett was so dumb.  Harvey, Harvey, I got a friend, Beth, smarter than you. 
[00:38:00]  One of these days, pow, right in the fat tongue.  Because you're a mongoloid.  A mongoloid. 
[00:38:30]  Mr. Faber-Sham, if you think I'm driving that retard around, it's out of the question, out of the question.  Beth, you've come back.  Oh, my head.  All right, let's move on here.  Let's go to Mandy. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, Mandy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Mandy?  Nothing.  I want to tell you that this is based on a true story.  Yes.  Yeah, Rosie was sort of saying that in that last clip.  It was based on a true story, so I know how it ends.  Oh.  So if you guys want to know.  Hell yeah, we want to know how it ends.  She gets a bum leg, while Rosie, the retard, she gets a bum leg, and her sister has to come, and it ruins her life.  And then the bus driver takes over and takes care of Rosie. 
[00:39:30]  So the bus driver takes care of her?  Yes, she gets a bum leg, and she can't walk.  She has to be wheeled around, and the bus driver comes to the rescue and takes care of her, and she lives at his house.  Oh.  So it's not that great of an ending, but.  Liz is the bus driver's house.  Geez, what's happening there?  Yeah, what is up with that?  A little diddle.  As long as she can take a little diddle.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right.  Bye-bye.  That's what he was saying to her.  Her little dumb face in the pillow, she's confused. 
[00:40:00]  That's right.  Earn your keep.  Earn your keep.  What is Eric having?  I didn't know what the rest of this was.  Oh, I think I know what he's saying.  Oh, okay.  Eric from Staten Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a big peek of the movie.  The subplot is the bus gets a flat tire, and Rosie, with her retard strength, picks up the bus because she didn't have a jack.  Watch it out.  With that retard strength.  I got it. 
[00:40:30]  This bit is picking up momentum, boys and girls.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris.  You're on the Opie and Anthony program.  How you guys doing?  We're having a good time today.  I hope someone's enjoying this crap.  Hey, I'll tell you what, man.  The retard stuff is not funny, but I was laughing my ass off.  That is some funny shit right there.  Oh, all right.  We turned you around a little bit.  Hey, get a load of retard over there.  Mom, Mom. 
[00:41:00]  Yes, honey?  You know when we were talking yesterday?  Yes, we were.  Do you know about periods?  Yes.  What about periods?  Do you have periods?  Yes.  All women have periods.  Tell me what happens.  Blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Do you have a question, Jill? 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  I want to know if Susie has periods.  Susie?  Yes, Mom?  Jill wants to know something.  We want, Jill.  Susie, do you have periods?  Do I have periods?  Jill, all women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  When I'm on my period, blood from inside of my body comes outside from an opening between my legs.  Susie, what about my teacher?  Does Ms. Jones have periods?  Yes, Jill, your teacher, Mrs. Jones, does have periods. 
[00:42:00]  All women have periods about every four weeks for three or four days.  Well?  Well?  That's from the Trainables audio, yes.  Good morning, Mr. Tampon!  You should see.  Did you get a chance to watch the clip of the period video?  I still have not seen the video.  It's up on foundrymusic.com, right?  Who the little girl in this, the retarded little girl that they're teaching look like?  And then I realize, because I watch Close Encounters, like one of the aliens that come off of the ship. 
[00:42:30]  Her face has that same look.  Okay.  And the older sister is telling her about periods, pulls down her pants, and shows this used pad, this big old 50s pad.  You can get to the video clips by going to opianthony.com.  Yes.  I'm a little distracted because the listeners are taking over the bit slightly here.  Joe in Jersey.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  My favorite part of the movie is when Eric Logan takes her to his barber.  Punching out. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, God damn.  Oh, over the fence with that one.  The listeners are taking over, Anthony.  Let's go to Tom on Long Island.  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jimmy, love you.  Thanks, bud.  Hey, I heard the sequel to this takes place in Israel, and Rosie's wearing a big puffy coat on the bus.  Punching out, guys. 
[00:43:30]  Wow.  Duke in Jersey.  What's up, Duke?  Duke?  Yes, I'm here.  What's up, Duke?  Oh, I was just going to say that Rosie has to go and rent out all of Giovanni Ribisi's movies to restart your retard role.  Yes, Giovanni Ribisi.  Extraordinaire.  All right.  We have a third clip, Anthony, from the Tony Danza show from yesterday.  Is this another clip for the movie or the same clip? 
[00:44:00]  No, it's the same clip.  Oh, hold on, buddy.  It's the same clip, but without the Tony Danza stuff around it.  It's just the clip from the movie.  Oh, man.  Man, we're going to have to wait until Monday.  I can't believe we have to wait.  Monday, we're going to have probably 20 clips.  Why couldn't we get a screen or copy of this?  They wouldn't send one over?  We should be able to see these in advance so we can comment.  We're probably going to give this show great ratings.  People are going to watch it just to see Rosie's standout performance as a retard.  You know, it's going to be hilarious, the confusion at the hallmark offices when they get the overnight ratings. 
[00:44:30]  Why is this show number one, men, 18 and 34?  We made this movie for, you know, middle-aged housewives.  Housewives.  That's wonderful.  Let's listen to the clip one more time, then.  This is the only one we got.  I know.  I can't wait.  What is this?  Britney Spears?  Okay.  No, not Britney.  I'm Cole Bess.  And you're a adult, and you're new. 
[00:45:00]  How do you know my name?  You're new, because I know everything.  Listen, you had to stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen-up leg, and she has to go to the doctor at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolpho, and listen to me.  Because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Beckfest.  Can I have some Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay.  I pity the boy, fool. 
[00:45:30]  Don't eat my cereal.  All right.  The pack has a swollen leg.  Aw.  See, they're making Beth look like she's the helpful one.  Right.  She knows everybody in the community.  How could she be retarded, yet she knows everything?  She could remember the names of the passengers and the bus drivers and the bus routes.  It's amazing.  It's special.  And the only thing she enjoys is riding the bus.  Riding the bus. 
[00:46:00]  And that's the only thing she can't do anymore.  There you go.  Because she has a bum leg.  She's got a bum leg.  So she can't ride the bus?  Yeah.  And that was her whole life.  It must be like, what?  What kind of bum leg?  A Mabel King bum leg?  Because that's a bum leg.  What kind of bum leg?  But she can't ride the bus and the bus driver takes her.  Oh.  You know there's something going on there.  Absolutely.  His poker buddies come over.  They'll jump on.  Hey.  Um.  George?  Hey, guys.  What's up, George?  Hey, the interview between Tony and Rosie. 
[00:46:30]  Which one was the idiot?  Or the retard?  Ah, fuck.  Punching out.  You, son.  You are.  Wow.  You had a good one.  You had a stuttering prick, you?  Which one's the first?  Your first one?  Nervous.  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  Nervous zilch.  I'm going to.  Hey, everybody.  This is your old pal, Greg Proops.  The specky one from Whose Line Is It Anyway?  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Nice tit.  Whose tit is that?  Eric. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  I thought you were looking over there.  It's great.  Eric, during the entire show, we'll just go to Mr. Skin and pop up.  Random celebrities.  That's all he does over there.  That are topless and nude.  Oh, my God.  How many times have I been sitting here going, wow, look at that.  It completely takes me out of the game.  Who is that?  I'm not complaining yet, but it does take you out of the game.  That's some, who is that again?  Sophia Marceau.  Yeah.  And she was in a bunch of foreign films.  Can't fire or something?  Foreign.  Her boob fell out at the Cannes Film Festival.  Is she European?  Get it?  The Cannes Film Festival. 
[00:47:30]  Hey now.  Hey now.  Hey now.  All right.  We're not here.  We're going to be back tomorrow for another live Opie and Anthony program.  But in the meantime, it's Rosie the Retard Part 2.  This is where it gets really, really good.  Yeah.  That's all we need to say here.  Get it.  We talked about, wait.  The Hallmark cards?  Shut up.  I had a perfect eye out there, dude.  Shush.  Shh.  All right.  Let's redo that.  No, we're not redoing it.  Just listening.  Redoing it.  It's your mistake.  You look like the idiot and it stays.  I want to look professional. 
[00:48:00]  Impossible.  Just listen to this.  All right.  Hear it.  You shut up.  I want to get the hell out of here.  Okay.  Sorry.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh.  Who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  What do you want to do?  Riding on the bus?  Yeah.  Let's get into that a little bit.  I just think we should watch where the jokes go.  I think that let's not target the mentally challenged.  I agree with you.  Take the high road. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I like how actually, even though it's radio, he puts the serious face on.  You know, guys, there's not even a hint of a smile.  I'm a method actor.  He's acting.  He really has to get into the character.  You know, all right, let me really think that I don't want to make jokes about this.  All right.  All right.  I'll wait.  Okay.  Okay.  Here was Rosie O'Donnell. 
[00:49:00]  I got to admit, I took a peek at the family guy.  Ugh.  It was not just an awful movie because of the content.  Rosie O'Donnell being a horrible actress and just running through as a parody of a retarded  person.  The movie itself, taken just as a movie, was so bad.  It was so disjointed and cliches left and right.  They kept throwing in these little things that lasted for a second that were supposed to make 
[00:49:30]  you think about something, I guess.  I don't know.  There was one part where they tried to get into this little story of this pervert that  drives around and gives Rosie O'Donnell's retard character a stuffed animal in the car  and goes, here you go.  And he looks all ratty and he pulls up slowly as she's walking on the sidewalk and she grabs  the stuffed animal and then walks a little like, oh no, and puts it in the garbage and  goes, that guy always tries to give me things.  And then that was it. 
[00:50:00]  Dude, it lasted for like five seconds.  Like, oh, the retards have to watch for the perverts.  Yes, okay.  I understand where they were going.  Because that's what's happening out there.  Yeah, yeah.  What is the pervert retarded to?  When you looked at.  I think that you're missing the message, Anthony.  Yeah, what was it?  That's the message to the parents, where if you have one of these, this is what you should  do with it.  Walk right outside, lift the lid.  Toss it in the garbage.  But they tried little things like that, like they were trying to make these points, but 
[00:50:30]  they were covered so quickly, like, okay, let's cover the pervert trying to pick her  up.  All right, let's get the mean, intolerant people on the bus.  Like, she gets on the bus and there's the bus drivers, which are all, every one of them,  very tolerant, very nice to her, very understanding.  And then a couple of passengers that, as viewers, you're supposed to hate.  Because they're like, what is she doing on this bus?  She doesn't have the proper past.  She's annoying.  And they're saying all this out loud, like no one would ever speak this shit. 
[00:51:00]  You say it under your breath and you kick them while they're not looking.  Things like, fun things like that.  Pinch their side fat.  Yeah.  Oh, get away from me.  And then one of the most unrealistic parts of the movie, when somebody getting on the  bus needed a nickel, didn't have a nickel, and a black gentleman actually gave a nickel.  And I saw that scene.  I'm like, stop it.  I was Rosie's sister there.  He looked like a thug.  He looked like a thug, but he's very charitable.  Well, then she tries to give him a dollar.  And he's like, yo, lady, you can't buy anything for five cents nowadays. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-huh.  Something like that.  And then there was one intolerant black woman.  Rosie gets on the bus, and she starts making retard faces at these two black children that  are sitting there.  And the black woman saw that the children were making faces back.  And she kind of takes him by the hands and moved her seat.  She went to the back of the bus, which somebody on Whack Bag went and wrote, well, I guess  old habits die young. 
[00:52:00]  Or something like that.  Old habits die hard.  Oh, I suck.  But apparently.  What's your favorite song?  Only the good die hard.  Only the good die hard.  What a tool.  I stink.  Now we know what you mean.  Yeah.  So did I.  Fortunately, it came out of my mouth like diarrhea.  That's all right.  Jim in Philly thought the movie wasn't that bad.  Jim?  What?  Yes.  Hey, Jim.  All right.  Howdy, faggot. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, I'm a faggot.  Hi, Jimmy.  I bought your new CD.  It's pretty good.  Thank you very much.  Why are you breathing like you just ate it?  Because I'm a fat fuck.  That's honest.  Well, there goes that question.  You like the movie there, Jim?  Yes, I do.  I had a retarded sister, and it brought back a lot of pain.  Did she ride the bus?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  No.  So it brought back a lot of what?  Like a lot of memories?  A lot of bad...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  A lot of bad...  My brother and I were constantly in fights, you know, protecting her, and, you know, because  people would make fun of her.  That seemed very unrealistic.  Yeah, what would they say to your sister?  What would they say to her?  A lot later.  Hey, you fucking retard.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Okay!  Yeah.  But she didn't talk like fucking Pee-wee Herman.  No.  Nah.  Is she still around?  She didn't talk like Pee-wee Herman, but she died when she was 26.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
[00:53:30]  Hello?  Yes.  What did she pass away from?  Well, they said natural causes, but I suspect it was sleep apnea.  Why a lot of retarded people have the sleep apnea?  Well, she was heavy, too, and I have sleep apnea because I'm a very heavy person.  I thought it might have been that big, thick tongue getting in the way while she was sleeping.  Oh, God.  I could have been.  She ain't heavy. 
[00:54:00]  She's my retarded sister.  That's true.  And I do drive a bus in Philadelphia.  We do get a lot of retarded people.  You do?  Are you the tolerant bus driver?  Sometimes, sometimes not.  Yeah.  Wow.  When they stand up at the bus and they start fucking hollering and screaming, you know, you've got time to put an answer.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, that's great.  This guy had a sister.  He had a sister that was retarded.  He's not tolerant. 
[00:54:30]  You just want to get through your day driving a bus, and you get this in the back.  Ah!  Ah!  Make somebody stop at that other bus stop!  Ha-ha!  But the one truth in the story was that a lot of them that get on do know everything there is to know about buses, bus lines, and everything.  Yeah, that's quite a resume stuffer.  Great.  Well, most of them don't work, or they do menial jobs for the IRS.  Why do they choose?  Wait, wait, wait.  Who do they work for? 
[00:55:00]  Uh, I get a lot of them that work for the IRS, International Revenue Service.  International Revenue Service.  Ha-ha-ha!  Did you say the International Revenue Service?  I did.  I deserved a car crash on that.  Of course you did.  That was a bus crash, because A, retards working for the IRS was the joke, and international, they don't tax us in Greece and Europe and here.  It's internal, sir.  The International Revenue Service.  All right, well, Jim liked the movie.  Yeah.  And I appreciate you touring on me. 
[00:55:30]  All right, Jim.  Bye, Jim.  Jim has a...  Have a good one, guys.  See you tomorrow.  I like those Die Young movies.  The three that came out.  Bruce Willis.  Old habits Die Young.  God, that ass.  All right, here we go.  God.  Riding the bus with my sister.  What else were you going to say about this movie?  A lot, another thing that was going on during the whole thing, and I don't know if this was just part of Rosie's story.  Rosie's contract, or the character, was supposed to be like this.  She was eating in every scene.  Eating in every single scene. 
[00:56:00]  And she was unhealthy.  She went to the doctor, and the doctor told her she's overweight and stuff.  And somebody pointed out on the message board that this woman is, this doctor is bashing Rosie's character, yet it's still Rosie that she's telling is unhealthy.  The only difference is this retarded character didn't wash her hair.  That was like the only difference between the retard and Rosie.  So this woman's saying how unhealthy and fat Rosie is as the retard.  Meanwhile, she didn't have padding on her or anything. 
[00:56:30]  She's just fat.  Oh, that's great.  So they're pounding her.  That's awesome.  Yeah, fat clay legs with no Ben Marchant.  Well, and, you know, I know it's very, you know, hack, as a comic, to talk of the big head gag.  The big head.  That's a big head.  You know, but her head is giant.  She has this, that big, fat head.  And at one point she was getting a hairstyle.  Her hairstyle, her sister took her, and they formed her curly locks into a perfect mullet. 
[00:57:00]  Could not possibly have made her look more retarded.  You know who should cut her hair?  David Ferry and Clay Shaw.  Oh, oh.  Hmm.  Eh.  Yeah.  I'm thinking.  Yeah, I, I got it.  JFK.  Yeah.  I got it.  Didn't really go over well.  All right.  You want to play some clips then?  You didn't say die young.  Well, he did.  Here's Rosie's character on the phone, I guess. 
[00:57:30]  I'm trying to use the phone.  No, that's peewee.  Yes, darling.  Hi, honey.  You okay?  Yes, I'm okay.  I'm okay, because I'm the sheriff.  Okay.  Yeah.  You have to take me to Super Save tomorrow, because I have a sale.  Okay, I'm going to pick you up at 6.  Yeah, 6.30.  I love you.  I have to go.  I have to go catch a bus.  Oh, wow.  I have to go catch a bus.  Oh, you are a bus, you pig. 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  Why are you so tolerant of the record?  I'm the sheriff.  No, you're not, stupid.  I'm the sheriff.  Somebody had the storyline all wrong, also.  They told us that at the end, she gets a bum leg.  Yeah, yeah.  And has to live with them.  And then I realized that was the storyline of Bill.  Somebody was trying to fool us.  Oh, okay.  That was the storyline of old Bill.  We don't have our Bill clips.  Mickey Rooney played a retard.  We have to get the Bill clips.  It was, I had a bad leg, and I have to live with Barry. 
[00:58:30]  And that's what happened.  He had a bum leg.  He would have had to go back to the home.  Oh, okay.  So he lived with the...  Someone got one past that, huh?  I know.  I didn't realize it until last night, when I'm like, hey, wait.  It didn't end like that.  That's one of our favorite comedies.  Of course it is.  How did it end?  I didn't see it.  Well, it ended the sister...  Well, the father that she's talking to on the phone, he dies.  He winds up dying.  And now he took care of Rosie's character, for the most part.  Rosie lived alone, but I guess he helped her out, whatever.  So now the sister, who is a very successful career woman, has to now come and kind of 
[00:59:00]  take care of her a little bit, and leave her job for a while, and she winds up breaking  up with her fiancÃ© because of the problem with the sister.  Yeah, that would happen in real life.  Yeah.  Of course.  Because...  She's a mess!  Sorry.  And now the movie is pretty much the sister trying to get a better understanding of her  retarded sister, because they haven't been together in years. 
[00:59:30]  She's been a busy career girl, you know.  Doesn't even acknowledge she's got this retard for a sister.  What's there to understand?  Nothing.  This movie was so shallow, and it had nothing to it.  They can't even watch the same TV programs.  So they drive on the bus together, and then Rosie tries hooking her up with the bus drivers.  This is my sister, and she's broke up with a boyfriend, and she reads books, and she...  Oh, and she just kind of smiles, like it's okay, instead of slapping her on the face and  telling her to shut up like any normal human would do. 
[01:00:00]  She should have pinched the back of her arm and just said, shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Ow!  Here's the argument on the stairs, Anthony.  What was this about?  I don't know.  I couldn't even understand the movie.  I was a retard watching it.  What do you think you are, a hippopotamus?  The way you clomp down the steps every morning?  Some people are still sleeping.  Not you.  You're not sleeping.  You're complaining.  That's what you're doing.  You're the hippopotamus! 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, that was her walking downstairs.  Wow, there's a lot of fat jokes in this movie, huh?  Well, yeah.  Well, she's fat.  Hmm.  Yeah, a big black woman is yelling at her for clomping down the stairs.  Every day, you're a first person on my bus.  Yeah.  You'd kill somebody to get on first.  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't kill.  She's got no place to go.  She just rides around all day.  So, it's a free country.  I'm a person.  I buy my bus pass for 40 bucks, and I'm first always, so that's why I'm first. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, you're doing it on the government dole.  I want you to do something useful in your life.  Okay, Henry.  Where is Beth going today?  I'm going to go to Elma.  Now, I'm going to catch a bus with Rick.  Ah, Rick is your new favorite.  Yeah, because he has a green car and he's cute.  A green Mustang.  Very classy.  Yeah.  I think he's going to take me for a ride in it.  What about your boyfriend?  What about Jesse? 
[01:01:30]  Jesse's delicious.  Yeah, so he's going to take me today to get a new toilet seat because mine got broken.  It was sliding.  So, I would fall off a bit like, whoa.  Fat ass.  Fat, retarded ass broke the toilet seat.  Why did somebody cut Henry off?  I really liked him.  Henry was telling it like it is.  She had a boyfriend, by the way.  She had a boyfriend, Jesse, who was this big, retarded black guy.  So, she, and apparently they were having sex and everything.  Was he saying, come on. 
[01:02:00]  Come on.  Come on with glass dildos.  Come on.  Yeah, that was another, you know, this whole thing was just full of this politically correct  drivel.  Just awfulness.  Like the people in the bus, the angry people, you know.  Why don't you get a job instead of being on the government dole?  And you're supposed to look over and go, yeah, that person's mean and awful.  Oh, and it's like every two seconds these little things were popping up.  The intolerant gang of white guys that beat up the black, that were trying to beat up 
[01:02:30]  the black, her black boyfriend on the bicycle.  And he knows Taekwondo.  Yeah.  The retarded black boyfriend.  So, he kicked ass.  And he got the retard strength, too.  Yeah, he had the retard strength.  And he kicked ass.  Got to be kind of stupid to take on a guy like that.  People started getting ready to attack him.  And Rosie goes, it's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  And he ran over in his Taekwondo duds.  They criticized her, and he went, you motherfucker.  Chris on Long Island. 
[01:03:00]  Chris.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Don't think that Rosie sounds like Barney Gumbel from The Simpsons.  All right.  That's good.  Sometimes it's peewee.  Sometimes it's Barney.  It's just minus the burp, right?  That's good.  The worst part of it is I was only able to whack my bag twice during that.  Peace out.  Very good.  The guy had a really good call.  So wait, not only was Rosie a retard, but she was in...  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  A two-time disappointer of the family.  Oh, my God.  Father's like, it just couldn't get any worse.  Daddy, me.  I stand corrected.  Okay, it can.  That's nice.  And both races will be destroyed.  They'll create a mongrel race.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, it's great.  Andy McDowell was the sister. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  She was the sister.  And I guess the beginning shot, the opening shot of the movie was pretty good.  She's kind of laying back on the bed and her nips were showing through the sweater.  So that was like the best part of the movie.  Oh, my savior.  Oh, I'm not your savior.  I'm just Beth.  Cool Beth.  Beth, my girlfriend.  Oh, my boring clothes.  What, am I scaring you?  What, am I scaring you?  Boo, boo, boo!  Beth.  Yeah.  There are no mind. 
[01:04:30]  It's a harmless retard.  It's don't make eye contact.  I'm having you!  That is hilarious.  Oh, is that the best line ever?  Another intolerant person on the bus.  Meanwhile, to me, those are the best people so far.  Of course.  Hendry and those two.  Hendry.  It's an intolerant person.  It's just a harmless retard.  Don't make eye contact.  Absolutely true.  Oh, wow.  Big dummy with panda legs.  That's what she has. 
[01:05:00]  Legs like a fat white panda.  She should be tugging a windbreaker through a cage.  Fat whore.  Panda.  I'm hearing you!  Bye.  When are you going to take me for a ride in your car?  In a green car, my case worker.  Oh, Olivia, huh?  Yes, Olivia.  She's pretty and she's nice.  Oh, that's a house where me and Eugene live. 
[01:05:30]  I think he's a jerk.  You think he's a jerk, Rick?  I don't think he's a jerk.  I think he's a little impatient.  Yeah, well, he put up that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it.  That didn't stop you, though, did it?  No, because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom.  If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody.  Yeah, that's great.  Employees work all day.  Sometimes I go in there if I don't have to go to the bathroom just to wash my hands and make them mad.  Just to wash my hands. 
[01:06:00]  How stupid can one person be?  Sometimes I just wash my hands.  You work hard and that dummy walks in and takes one of her retard dumps with gum and pennies in it.  Little shards of glass and fur. 
[01:06:30]  Gum and pennies.  That was part of the movie was that she ate everything, which is good for Rosie O'Donnell.  But as a kid, they did a lot of flashbacks where they showed her as a little kid, which is great for the kid's image as an actress.  You know, you're really good.  You're a fat retard.  Here you go.  You're the fat retarded girl.  And she was eating everything.  She was outside eating dirt.  They had her eating dirt. 
[01:07:00]  They had her eating paint.  The paint.  She was trying to do a little painting and she was eating the paint.  And that's what Rosie grew into.  Somebody that just...  Oh, my God.  The inside of the toilet looks like Dreyfuss' living room in Close Encounters.  This means something.  I've got a big...  There's a mountain in my toilet.  I don't know. 
[01:07:30]  Maybe if I put some lines in the side, it'll ring a bell.  Be realistic, Rick.  Open your eyeballs and you can see that he's a little bit of a jerk.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, Shanae, you're growing.  Yeah, I'm big as a truck. 
[01:08:00]  Mom, sit here, sit here.  You want to feel them kick?  He's a pregnant woman.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Put your hands on my tummy.  He's moving all over the place.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Rick.  Rick, you want to touch that?  I'm driving here, Beth.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have something to show you.  Oh, yeah?  Look.  Oh.  These are my niece and my nephew, Alex and Maddie.  Adorable. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I love him so much.  I never met him, but my brother says, come bring him over, Bobby.  Sure is.  He's cute.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Is the pregnant woman patting her own stomach and looking at the retard and then look you  up going, please, guys.  Please.  Please.  Hey, Rick, what are you doing?  Stop singing that song.  It's going to get you fired.  Oh, man.  Oh. 
[01:09:00]  Wow.  Man.  Okay, Jesse, here they are.  I like the fishies.  What do you like?  Uh, this one.  This one.  This one's so retarded boyfriend.  Oh, but Jesse, that one's ugly.  Nobody wants to sit on that.  You know me.  I'm fussy.  Sit on.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  We need some help.  I've got it.  Can we have assistance play the road number one for toilet seat? 
[01:09:30]  Hello?  Toilet seat assistance is road number one.  Thank you.  Okay.  I love this joint anyway.  Well?  Well?  See, we.  Yeah, and, um, sweet corn smile from Syracuse.  Rosie sounds like the Saturday Night Live skit Amy Poehler does as the little girl.  Yeah.  Rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack, rack.  Hey!  Over here! 
[01:10:00]  Ha ha!  Oh, she is awful.  Oh, this is great.  It is so bad.  It's such a bad.  You can't get over the put-on retard that she's doing.  This over-the-top bad.  That's what I saw.  Oh, it's horrible.  So far, Henry and those other two guys are my favorite characters on television.  That sounds like the cookie monster a little bit, too.  C is for chromosome, which I do not have. 
[01:10:30]  Ha ha!  Today's show is sponsored by the letter U.  Ugh!  All right, I guess this is where the movie gets very dramatic, Anthony.  The father has a heart attack.  Hangers are more for just than hanging your clothes.  Hangers are used for things other than just hanging your clothes.  The father has a heart attack? 
[01:11:00]  Yes, this is where the father dies, I guess.  They have to call up Rosie, and she runs to the hospital,  and it's trying to be a touching scene, and it was nothing but humor.  It's just funny.  When was the last time she saw her father?  I talked to him all the time on the phone.  He was much too busy to visit her?  No, no, I guess he would visit her, too, and give her things.  So, you know, I guess they were close. 
[01:11:30]  What?  I tried to meet you at home, but I missed you.  You must have already left.  Yeah, well, I was here.  Would you like a cookie?  It's chocolate flavor.  Very nutritious.  Eating again.  No, thanks.  But, um, is there some place we can go?  What for?  Beth, your dad, uh...  Yeah, I'm afraid your father's had a heart attack.  Oh, no.  No.  Oh, lady, I'm not taking me to the super saver.  I'm going to go get rich.  What?  Beth.  Ow.  Beth. 
[01:12:00]  Um, slow down.  You've had surgery.  I think you might...  You might just want to...  Beth!  Beth!  Beth!  Beth!  Beth!  Excuse me, sorry.  Excuse me, I just got to...  What's wrong?  The panicking retard.  Beth's dead in the hospital.  Massive heart attack.  You okay, Beth?  Yeah, time to start the bus.  No, I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Ah, you've got slow, Rick.  I'm going to report you.  Beth.  No.  No, love you.  Everybody has a schedule. 
[01:12:30]  I've got a schedule.  We're going to Happy Timmy's bus today.  That's why it is.  Beth, can I call someone for you?  Rick, you're cute, but your clothes are faded.  They're not very nice.  But you look at my clothes.  They're very bright.  I give everybody lots of color.  Oh, where is he?  St. Matthew's.  Beth, listen to me.  No.  Your dad's in the hospital.  Yeah.  I have to go to the hospital.  I'll take you there.  No, you're rude.  There's other people on the bus, by the way.  And he's just going to, you know, hey, we've got to go to the hospital. 
[01:13:00]  That would happen in real life.  Excuse me.  That would happen.  Fired.  Where's your pass, fatso?  I don't have it.  Then get off.  You would be fired for that.  Of course.  You can't take the bus off the route.  All right, now she's visiting her father in the hospital.  So, yeah.  Oh, no.  Where's Simon?  Where's my daddy?  Where's my daddy?  Oh!  Running through the hall.  He's in a coma.  He's unconscious.  He won't even know you're here. 
[01:13:30]  Yes, he will, because he's knowing.  I think it's important for Beth to see her dad.  No!  I want to see him!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Father's, like, finally in peace.  Oh, daddy!  I didn't want you to say it this way.  He's just pretending he can't hear her?  Oh, daddy!  Does it hurt you?  It's me, the sheriff!  Dad!  Can you hear me?  Oh, dad!  You're going to take me to the super safe today!  You have to wake up! 
[01:14:00]  You have to wake up!  It's you, me!  Dad, we make a good team!  It's you, me!  He's not going to die, is he?  Okay!  Beth, please, not so loud.  But he's not going to die, right?  Maybe you'd like to come outside and sit down.  Baby, you should do something!  You just stand there, you're doing nothing!  Beth, please, calm down.  It's time we let your dad rest.  No, it's not time!  I'm going to stay here!  It's not time!  We'll have to cooperate.  You are not my mother! 
[01:14:30]  You're not!  That doesn't mind how I...  I was, I'd have thrown myself down the stairs.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was the heart-tugging scene.  That was the...  Rosie crying.  Now she's got to move on and get along without her dad to help her.  So that's where her sister is.  I mean, there's a ton of clips still to go here.  Which ones do you want to go to?  No.  Let me see.  What do you mean?  They all stink. 
[01:15:00]  Birthday party on the bus.  How about the ones where bees sting her fat legs?  While she rolls around confused in the yard.  It was just such a horrible movie.  It's just her walking around pretty much doing what we've already heard.  This bad retard voice put in situations that garner her no sympathy whatsoever from the audience watching.  She's just an annoying...  Oh, well, there's the Hallmark retard commercial. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  They were...  Now, during this whole movie, which was sponsored by Hallmark 29...  Sponsored by Hallmark, every commercial break, there were like two of these drama commercials.  They went on and on forever.  And it was supposed to, you know, be feel good.  And one was how this little boy comes home from school and his teacher gave him a card because he was nice to another student who was like developmentally challenged, I believe.  And the mother's very proud of her son for helping. 
[01:16:00]  And another one was this woman who was very successful comes back to visit a teacher that taught her this old man.  I guess it looked like he was retiring, too.  Gives him a card and stuff.  And he says, wow, you've done very well in life.  What are you, a stockbroker or a lawyer?  And she goes, no, I'm a teacher.  And then Bob Kelly bursts into tears.  What do the cards say?  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Thanks for wrecking our family photographs, you genetic disaster, you. 
[01:16:30]  And then there was this one.  All right.  Which was, I guess, this woman.  She's in her office.  She comes across as a very stuffy, all business kind of woman.  She leaves the office and goes to, I guess it's her brother, her retarded brother's house.  Yes, Jimmy? 
[01:17:00]  Oh, no.  I was just thinking of another card he gives to the retard.  It's a picture of a dumpster in the back of a Planned Parenthood.  And the card says, wish you were here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:17:30]  I'm crying.  yeah so uh she goes over her brother's house i guess it is and uh he's uh got down syndrome  he's very self-sufficient that he uh she gives him the card it's a heart interacting with her  retarded brother  hey dave hi tris come on in you show me around sure this is my living room great and this is my tv 
[01:18:00]  and down the hall that's where i jerk off 23 hours a day this is my bedroom  and this is my kitchen what are you cooking over there oh i'm making vegetable soup  you look good hungry i'm always hungry not for your vegetable soup sticky nasty fingers in there  vegetable soup it's a bowl with three of the presents 
[01:18:30]  i'm so proud of you reading the card  i'm proud of you too tris  they had a close-up of his hands as he's opening the card right and you would think that they would 
[01:19:00]  have told him hey clip your nails he had these these ricky the intern nails they're big and pointy  and they were on the ends of fingers that looked like you ever see a gecko the lizard like they got  those fat fingers on the little stubby that's what it looked like is like gecko hands his hands were  laws his hands were all burnt because he wasn't heating up the soup he was eating up his own  just stirring it with his hand 
[01:19:30]  i call the carrots bob  shut up stupid hallmark cards god they got cards for everything now they got cards for retards  you just learned to wipe your bottom happy 35th birthday  uh bingo pants from whackbag.com bingo pants  how you doing guys what's up  i want to see if uh since hallmark uh produced this thing do you think they're now going to have a section of cards for retards  like they can get uh their own parents and anniversary cards in 
[01:20:00]  do you guys thanks for not taking a hanger to me  yeah  that'll be good too late um and i noticed a couple more clips here that we want to play  all right let her rip  well uh beth wants to have a baby  oh right  well  this might be worth uh playing  yeah yeah she wanted to have a baby because she's uh she's in love with a boyfriend jesse the black uh retarded guy  and they are having sex  but they had a flashback scene where apparently the um the sister there and the father were a little leery of this whole thing 
[01:20:30]  so um they uh they had her tubes tied  and she couldn't have a baby and she was uh very disappointed with that  yes  smart parents  absolutely  smart father and uh sister  you should have given her a hysterectomy  but i i stopped myself short because i didn't have anything else  and i was actually hoping the clip would play  and then you stopped it i'm like

[01:22:00]  later on in this scene  i guess it's in the clip  as they're wheeling her gurney through the hospital  she has a few comments to me  i also have to know  did the camera pan to her legs  and the baby legs  and you couldn't tell which was which  big fat dimpled knee  the thing is you could get pregnant if you're not careful  and everyone knows you're not very careful  i'm sure this jesse guy is very nice  but do you really want to have a baby  i must  babies are not dolls 
[01:22:30]  they're not puppies or kittens  babies get sick  they need constant attention  how would you manage that bathroom  you can't even hook your own bra  do you really want to take that chance  do you want to have a baby  hook my own bra  they make them without hook  can't hook her own bra because she's too fat 
[01:23:00]  big pig  has nothing to do with being retarded  then they  they show her  getting her tubes tied  do we have that  i don't know  what track is that  i don't think  i don't think  you better have that gurney  wheeling down that hallway  i don't know if we do  with her  her comments  let me try this  there's a conversation about  getting her tubes tied  all right let's hear that  i don't know if this is  i don't know  i'm glad with kids  that's why i say  because it's true  that's right bed 
[01:23:30]  and kids love you  yes  i can't have any kids  that  that's true  that my tubes tied up  tied up  but that's okay  because then i don't have to worry when i'm with jesse  you know what i mean  do you like marshmallows  i love marshmallows  me too  we got something in common  the kind with the sugar on the top  i haven't had those  yeah i have them sometimes  they're holiday

[01:24:30]  hey keep wheeling her right through  sink your decision to make stupid  i don't care what the birth certificate says  mind of a six year old  and they clip her anyway  all right then it's beth and rachel say goodbye  and then beth back to riding the bus  everything's all  oh it ends happy  all nice  yeah it ends  same way  it ends actually with the clip that we played  on friday  we're done with this  there was nothing to this  this was a non-movie 
[01:25:00]  aside from her  walking around sounding like peewee retarded  oh two just  imagine her and that black guy  just going at it in bed  but you know what  you gotta think  it's probably pretty cool for them  it's just pure pleasure  there's nothing  nothing rattling around in that head  to distract you  that genital mix  it probably smells like a reuben  to unwashed fat dopes  coming up next on opie and anthony  jim norton  sing  forget me not

And you know what?  You'll pack me up and send me home.  Or else your wife will yell at you.  I want to go home.  A new after-school special.  On ABC.  Oh, I'm home?  Part two of I'm home?  I want to go out. 
[01:45:30]  Let's go to Tony on the phone.  Tony.  Hey, do you remember that after-school special where the guy always peed his bed and the mom  left his sheets out?  Oh, that was the Michael Landon story.  Very good.  The Michael Landon story.  He was a track star and he peed himself.  That's a true story.  That's what happened to Michael Landon when he was growing up.  He was a track star.  He peed his bed and his mom used to hang the urine-stained sheets out the window for the  whole neighborhood to see. 
[01:46:00]  Bedwetter.  Bedwetter.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Dave.  I guess we got to take a little breaks.  Breaks?  Yeah.  A breaks.  I put on the breaks.  A breaks snowboard.  A breaks.  Hey, what's up, America?  This is Tracy Morgan and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Don't get it twisted.  Well, I got something to play for you.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  Because you guys do have this obsession with Mike Brady.  Oh, it's an obsession.  Pretty obsessed with him.  Maybe.  Sure.  Here's him describing the first time he ever kissed a girl.  Really?  To one of the kids.  Yeah.  In the Brady bunch.  Hi, sweetheart.  You like my dress?  Mom, can I talk to Dad for a minute?  It's kind of a father-son thing.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, since I don't really know where to start.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Long pause.  Well.  For Christ's sake, say something.  Excuse me, Bobby.  Bobby?  It's a father-son thing, Dad.  Stop.  Come on, Bobby.  Come up to the bathtub with me.  Let me smell your breath. 
[01:47:30]  Long pause.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Ah!  Yeah, I kind of remember that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I throw up.  Her father walked in the room.  I found him much more attractive.  So he's stuck in my keister, and look at me now.  I'm losing weight rapidly.  Oh, it's the story of a man named Brady, and he's wearing pants that get looser by the 
[01:48:00]  day...  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Yeah, I kind of remember that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Their father walked in. 
[01:48:30]  I mean, how'd you feel?  Like, did you see skyrockets or something?  Oh, skyrockets came later.  Right up my ass.  Well, not skyrockets, exactly.  Uh, a few little firecrackers, maybe.  Well, if you did see skyrockets, would that mean you're in love?  I mean, your father had to take out.  I mean, that depends, I suppose.  It could.  People who are in love get engaged, right?  Yeah, well...  And then they get married. 
[01:49:00]  Well, I think in your case...  In some states.  Yeah, well...  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case I'd recommend a long engagement.  How long?  About ten years.  Some love and marriage and engagements, it's a wonderful business, but you want to make very  sure about those skyrockets.  Make sure.  Thanks, Dan.  I'll keep in touch.  And by the way...  How can you do that? 
[01:49:30]  Those weren't firecrackers, they were T-cells exploding.  A little something for you guys and your obsession with Mike Brady.  Yeah.  Because of Mike Brady thing.  We can't stop talking about him.  This is hilarious.  Oh, with his little robe and slippers, last days, walking around the hospital, 65 pounds.  Why couldn't I have liked girls? 
[01:50:00]  Hi, this is Dominic Canese.  You're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Opie.  Jimmy is sleeping on the couch, the lesbian couch.  Getting ready for another fine Opie and Anthony program.  But why is he sleeping on the couch if we're not even here today?  Stayed.  You stayed all weekend? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  How are you feeling?  I'm very tired, but while you guys are gallivanting, I'm kind of looking after the forge.  We're getting ready for another fine Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  We've got to intro a few bits here, and then we're going to get some more bits on the air  that we have to intro because we're not here today.  Right.  I'm in Florida celebrating my birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  I noticed a date on the paper here.  It's my birthday.  How about that?  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Angel.  Thank you, Anthony.  Remember when Tracy Morgan was in studio?  Of course. 
[01:51:00]  He gave us some hilarious radio.  Hilarious.  And that's all I have to say about this.  I don't remember anything else about it.  So why don't we just play Tracy Morgan in studio?  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you.  What, what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are we doing a baseball game?  Tracy.  What is up, Tracy?  Tracy Morgan in studio.  His first visit on the brand new show.  He's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday.  212-757-4100 for ticket information. 
[01:51:30]  But, I mean, you've blown up so big, we don't even have to sell these shows, right?  When?  Wow.  You've blown up, bro.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know, I'm still out there getting them pregnant and stuff.  Yeah?  Yes.  You don't wear bags?  Nah.  Never.  But, hey, where's Kim?  Let me, let me, can I smell Kim?  Thank you.  Sniffing Jimmy's fingers?  Yes.  That's great.  I think she said her name was Kim.  She had a wig and a Colby jersey.  I hope it was a she.  It's good to be back here with you guys, man. 
[01:52:00]  I miss you.  Yeah.  Been a while.  Word up.  Definitely.  Last time we saw each other, we went through, what, 30 cases at the baseball game?  I was pitching.  Yeah, we first met Tracy.  Jim Brewer introduced us to Tracy.  See, Brewer was talking about Tracy Morgan for years, and we finally got to meet Tracy  at our celebrity softball game.  Brewer just brought him along.  He wasn't really doing our show at that point or anything, and Tracy just freaking stole  the show.  I had a great time, man.  At one point, I was in, like, the pool naked with, like, two chicks, man.  You got to understand, we do these celebrity softball games from time to time, and there 
[01:52:30]  were 6,000 people at the last one.  No exaggeration.  It was sold out at a minor league stadium, and Tracy decided he needed a pitch, so he walks  out of the dugout in just his tighty-whities.  It was a jock, right?  With your pair of jeans.  Yeah, it was just a jock strap.  That was all he was wearing.  Jock strap and cleats.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books now.  I mean, they open up the Opie Anthony show.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books.  You know, no Fugazi here.  Dude, those pictures have circulated around the internet for years.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  For years.  They pop up every once in a while when I'm doing searches.  Yeah.  You pitching in a jock strap in front of 6,000 people.  With a gut.  With a gut.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're a lot thinner.  Speed bump.  You got that Hollywood thinness to you now.  What happened?  You trimmed down a whole lot.  Man, I got on some no-carb stuff.  You know, I'm a carnivore.  I'm a New York guy, man.  I love my carbs, man.  You know, it's just crazy out there, man.  But I'm having a good time.  I'm partying.  Yeah, you're a Hollywood slim now.  Nah, you know what I mean?  I still drink my beer and all that.  My brewage, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  Got it.  I just got into a shoving match at the club the other night.  Get out with who?  Yeah, with my cousin.  Really?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I don't drink Cristal.  No.  I drink brewage.  Yeah, I drink brewage.  Why is my bill $1,600?  And why is it coming to me, dude?  $1,600?  I had like two platinum chains, and they got ripped off my neck and everything.  So wait, your cousin is drinking the Cristal?  No, he was drinking brew, too. 
[01:54:00]  He just ordered it as a gag.  Are you kidding me?  He ordered it as a gag?  He said, you're rich.  You got a TV show.  I said, no, this show got canceled, dude.  Can't order stuff like that now, man.  And they come up to you with a bill, and you get in a shoving match with your cousin.  Yeah, man.  Did you kick his ass?  Nah, no punches were thrown.  We just grabbed each other's shirts.  A few buttons popped off.  That was it.  Yeah.  I broke a nail, though.  I'm Hollywood now.  You got to watch out.  I don't eat carbs. 
[01:54:30]  I'm Hollywood.  I'm La Brea.  You know, getting back to the celebrity softball game.  The best part of the celebrity softball game was afterwards.  We were in the locker room.  That's what Michael Jackson touched me, but y'all didn't know that.  That's what Michael Jackson touched me.  And you were hammered, man.  You had to have half a case of beer easily.  And a little of this, you know, a little this.  Yeah, for dolo.  That's marijuana, not coke.  Then you were trying to rally the troops to get a trip going to Harlem. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  You wanted to, like, get all the white boys together.  And let's go up to Harlem.  Yeah, a little field trip to Harlem.  I had a couple of strippers that I wanted to introduce you guys to.  That's right, yeah.  Young, fresh, and green.  I've never laughed harder in my life.  No exaggeration.  You are so on talking about how white we really were  and that we needed a field trip to Harlem.  No soul, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Get you guys some afros and stuff like that.  We'd have been great.  You know, shake a few people down. 
[01:55:30]  We'd have been great.  Harlem ain't like the old days, though, now.  Good cop, bad cop.  You know what it is.  They're kind of, I don't know, they're reworking Harlem.  They're fixing everything up.  Well, what happened was a Starbucks appeared.  Yeah.  That's what I knew was going down.  That's the beginning, right?  Yeah, the Genovese and the Starbucks came to the ghetto.  Genovese and the Starbucks, that's when it's going commercial.  And then who bought the Apollo and fixed that all up?  Wasn't it like white people?  Mm-hmm.  Like some white people bought.  Some white people bought the Apollo.  You know that. 
[01:56:00]  We didn't have the money.  We didn't have the bread.  No.  I think this white dude bought one of Whitney Houston's Grammys.  I went next door.  It was Whitney Houston's neighbor.  I went to his crib.  Really?  And I seen a Grammy sitting on the coffee table.  I said, sir, how did you get that?  He said, don't you worry about it.  And then I looked on the wall.  He had my prerogative platinum album on his wall.  I said, how'd you get that?  He said, don't worry about it.  Yeah, they knew that.  I said, there's a garage sale out over there.  You know Whitney Houston lost a tooth? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah?  Really?  She lost a tooth, man.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  How do you think she lost a tooth?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hope Bobby ain't smoking.  I don't know.  It's either Bobby knocked it out or she chipped it with a crack pipe.  I don't know.  Man, she just looks like a crackhead these days.  You got to leave that Coke alone, man.  It's 99 and 0.  You can't win.  Nah.  Yeah, you can't win.  She sweats like a pig.  You see Bridget Nielsen?  Yeah.  Whoa, she used to be a hot chick.  She's on the Coke you think?  She used to be a hot chick, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Probably, man.  She used to be bad.  That just might be time, though.  I still get a pregnant, though.  Oh.  I still beat that.  Nah.  I get a pregnant and a heartbeat.  What?  That's Bridget Nielsen.  Oh.  She dating Foofy Foofy.  That's over, though, because she ended up marrying the Italian dude.  She did?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  The Italian midget, they call him.  So, you don't wear bags at all.  I don't like wearing bags.  Do you like when they tell you that you don't have to pull out?  Like, I like that when they tell me that I'm on the pill and you don't have to pull out.  There's something really sexy.  Why?  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Because we old school, man.  We are old school.  I can't take the time out to rip a package and all that.  Come on, man.  I'm 36 years old.  My concentration's got to be right there.  Yeah, but you don't want to.  It's like when you masturbate, everything's got to be quiet.  The pillows don't touch my arm.  I don't want the pillows to touch my arm.  I get everything straight.  I've got to set everything up.  I've got to do, like, six push-ups.  You know what I'm saying?  Just get everything straight.  Fix the track, get in the contrast on the TV.  No music playing in the background.  No music. 
[01:58:00]  Everything's got to be silent.  You ever notice when you masturbate, everything sound like a car door slamming?  What, outside distractions?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's awful.  I can't do it, dawg.  I can't do it.  It's like when you have sex with your woman after you've been with her for, like, ten years.  You know, you've got to concentrate and you've got to focus on that dead roach in the corner.  You've got to focus on that ball of dirty socks.  Oh, my God.  Complete concentration.  You know what the aroma is when grown people have sex?  You ever walk by a room after, like, two grown people have sex? 
[01:58:30]  It smells like coffee.  It smells like potato chips and pretzels.  It smells like butt, testicles, Bacardi and Coke, Marlboro lights, and Doublemint.  That's the smell of love.  Dirty socks and tears.  But, that's what, you ever, like, my son is 19, right?  And all he does is masturbate at this point. 
[01:59:00]  You know, I've got to get him something because he's going to go pop.  He might kill me and his mother, you know, and say that the devil made him do it or something.  I've got to get him laid.  I've got to get this dude laid.  But, you know, his room smells like, right?  Bust off in socks.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  He's 19.  I caught him.  He was humping my leg the other day, man.  I beat him with a newspaper.  Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?  I don't know.  The dude is into his academics.  Really?  He's into academics.  That kind of gets in the way sometimes.  He's into academics. 
[01:59:30]  I say, oh, man.  That gets in the way, bro.  You don't know, brother.  You've got to get off that stuff.  When I was 19, by the time I was 19, I had an empire ready.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had several kids.  Several kids.  Of which I never claimed.  How many kids do you think you've got?  Between 12 and about 35.  I told you, I don't use bags, man.  Never.  We don't pull out.  I think that's a real woman when she says, no, you don't got to.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  Well, maybe she's just looking for the Tracy Morgan money.  Well, you know, whenever I need income taxes and stuff like that. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, some deductions?  You know me, man.  I'm like Jim Brown, baby.  I'm in the Hall of Fame.  As a matter of fact, I'm doing a celebrity golf tournament.  What?  While I'm in town, yes.  It's a benefit for women with C-section scars, man.  I'm trying to raise some money for C-section scars and stretch marks.  That's my thing.  Are you a golfer, Tracy?  No, but we just put together.  And the key note speakers will be Al Sharpton.  Benoit Benjamin will be speaking.  Sharpton is a golfer? 
[02:00:30]  Benoit Benjamin.  Who's that?  Benoit Benjamin testified against Jason Williams for the Nets.  That's right.  Really?  Benoit was sleeping on his couch and he testified.  See, if I was Jason Williams, I would have said yes.  I would have just implicated the Harlem Globetrotters.  I would have kept putting the word cocaine and Globetrotters together.  Because they'd be loved.  And I know a lot of people in that jury, in the jury box, loved them.  So I would have just said yes.  Yes.  I admit.  I was doing cocaine with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Yes.  Yes, me and the G-Trotters was doing coke. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  I didn't mean to shoot nobody, but yes.  Metal Lock Lemon brought four eight balls.  Yes.  Yes, Curly McNeil.  Yes.  I was sniffing with Curly.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Do some tricks.  Yeah.  Distract the jury a little bit.  Sure.  There's someone on the phone that has a Tracy Morgan story.  Uh-oh.  Let's go in here for a second.  Colin in Connecticut.  Colin.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Well, we have Tracy Morgan in the studio.  He's playing Caroline's all this weekend here in New York City.  Well, I was an intern at Saturday Night Live five years ago. 
[02:01:30]  And, Trey, I don't know if you remember me.  My name's Colin Cosell.  Oh!  What's up, Colin?  That's Howard Cosell's grandson.  I've actually met him, too, I think.  That's my dude.  That's my dude.  Wait.  Howard Cosell was your grandfather?  Yeah.  Jimmy and I did stand-up.  We did in New York together.  Yeah.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  What's up, bro, bro?  How you been, man?  I cannot complain, my man, but I've got the best Tracy Morgan story ever.  Shoot.  They brought in a new intern one day, and this kid was completely starstruck, and Trey's 
[02:02:00]  just like, yo, Colin, go and grab this kid, bring him down the hall, and tell him Trey  Morgan's got something to tell him.  I was like, all right.  So I grabbed this kid.  I think his name was Winston.  I said, Winston, Tracy Morgan wants to see you.  He goes, really?  And his jaw drops, and his eyes are big, and he cannot wait.  Bring him into Tracy Morgan's dressing room, because Trey used to let me go.  Don't smoke cigarettes in there.  Thank you very much, Trey.  Right on, baby.  And sits him down, and he's got a chair right there, and he pops in this orange videocassette. 
[02:02:30]  Now, he's got an orange videocassette.  It's either a Disney film or a nasty-ass porn.  And he pops it in, and lo and behold, there's this black dude with this 18-inch bone, and  this white girl dressed as a cheerleader blowing him.  And this kid's fucking eyes blew out of his head.  Blew out of his head.  That's right.  Remember that scene?  Oh, dude.  That was just awesome.  Just to loosen him up, right?  That'll loosen.  Real people do real things. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Go outside to smoke a blunt, and people will ask for his phone number, and he'll say,  Colin, take this and walk the other way.  Mm-hmm.  I gave the guy the tape, too.  Oh, man.  What a guy.  That kid was crazy, man.  We had a good time, though.  Yeah, we did.  But the fact that this is Howard Cosell's grandson.  I know.  I haven't really...  That was my dude, man.  We used to go to lunch together, man.  He used to tell me stories about his grandfather, you know?  Yeah.  How old were you when he passed away?  That was April 23rd, 95.  I was 15. 
[02:03:30]  So 15.  So you had some time with him.  I mean, you remember him.  I had a lot of time with him.  No, he was around constantly.  Who has the toupee?  I've heard rumors that someone has the toupee.  That's impossible.  I used to put the tape in for...  When my grandmother passed away, I used to put the tape in that thing for him.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, we were very, very close.  Hey, did you ever meet Ali?  Oh, of course.  Oh, man.  You want to hear a great story.  I was six years old, and that was the first time I met Ali.  Six years old, and I wake up to this big black man shaking me and saying, 
[02:04:00]  Come on, little man.  Your grandfather wants to come have lunch with us.  And I wake up.  There's this gigantic black man shaking me.  And I'm like, what in the fuck is going on?  That's all you know at the time.  He walks me out, and I'm shaking.  I'm like, hi, Papa.  Who's this?  You met Muhammad, I see.  I'm like, yes, I did.  He said, Muhammad is a good friend of mine and the greatest of all time.  I was like, okay, this means nothing to me. 
[02:04:30]  That is a great impression, dude.  Wow.  Well, he's.  Well, I grew up with him, man.  I used to listen to him screaming at the television.  We got him into hockey.  And he used to yell, John Van Beesbrook.  We taught him that his nickname was Beezer.  So he'd sit there going, Beezer.  Beezer.  I can't wait for halftime.  I need to take a tinny.  And they're like, what?  Look at the thing.  Isn't that funny?  This guy's just like, that's his grandfather.  Everyone has their, like, kooky grandfather stories, but this is how it goes south. 
[02:05:00]  He has an impression and all.  Hey, dude, they should put you on Saturday Night Live, man.  I wish they would.  I'd lose the work, god damn it.  Right on.  Well, we got to get you in here.  I would love to go in there, man.  All right.  Hell yeah.  Well, hold on the line.  We're going to get your contact info and have you in.  Oh, Jimmy's shaking his head no?  What?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't want you in here.  Jimmy's like, no, that's not true.  No, I actually liked him.  We met at New York.  He was a nice dude, man.  I liked him a lot.  And actually, my friends were so excited to meet Jimmy that Jimmy was just moving to 
[02:05:30]  his new apartment, and I introduced my friends to him, because they were big fans of Jimmy  Norton.  Who isn't?  I mean, how can you not be?  He's gorgeous.  And they ended up having a conversation about how to hang a mirror on sheetrock.  That's right, because I was worried.  I bought an apartment.  They should have just lined cocks up that I could lick on the way into my door.  I bought candles and little rocks and a mirror.  Bed, bath, and beyond, Jimmy.  Bed, bath, and beyond, right?  All right. 
[02:06:00]  So, off air, they're going to take your information and stuff.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, we'd love to have you in, Colin.  I'd love to come in, guys.  I'd love to.  All right, cool.  There he goes, Colin from Connecticut.  Colin, be good.  That's pretty cool.  Cedric from Tennessee wants in.  Cedric.  What's happening?  What's up?  Hey, man, I just want to know if Tracy got any steaks for sale, man.  I'm having a barbecue this weekend.  Ah, you're talking about the meat man character I'm playing.  Hell yeah, man.  You know me, man.  But I'll be at the barbecue, baby.  Yes, word, man.  Hey, I'm going to invite you to little brother Spoonie Love in, too, man. 
[02:06:30]  You got it, man.  Let me tell you something about Spoon, man.  You know, Caligula invented the, he invented the orgy, right?  But Spoonie invented the pop-off.  You know, the jump-off.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  How about your boy?  Have a good barbecue, man.  Hey, word.  All right.  You're speaking some kind of code language.  I understood that.  We don't quite understand.  White people, white people.  We just heard nothing, nothing, nothing.  Caligula.  Okay.  It's good black stuff. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, you call it black pro.  How long have you been off SNL?  You've been there for a long time, man.  Yeah, I was there for seven years, but I've been off for about two now.  Off for two?  Do you have SNL or do you want to go back now?  Nah, man.  I'm good.  I'm moving forward.  I'm out of daddy's house.  The last two or three years, you just blew up.  Like, for a while.  My show got canceled, man.  I went out to L.A.  No, but I mean the last couple of years of Saturday Night Live, you just blew up.  Yeah, I mean.  I'm like, all that talent was just sitting there for all those years, and then finally they used you.  Yeah, it took them about four years.  It was unbelievable.  It was like steaming Willie Beeman for many given Sunday. 
[02:07:30]  Where was Brian Kello?  My career was going, man.  Where was Brian Kello?  You had some unbelievable characters the last couple of years there.  And I'm thinking at home, all this was in them, and they're not using them.  They didn't use them for many years.  I don't think Lauren, and I'm sure you love Lauren, but I personally don't think he uses black talent very well, to be honest with you.  And I've heard that complaint from other performers, and it was like, I mean, Murphy blew up when, you know, I think Ebersole was there.  Yeah, Ebersole was there.  But, you know, I never looked at it like a color thing. 
[02:08:00]  Excuse me.  I never looked at it like a color thing.  It just takes time for people to know your voice and the writers to get to know your voice.  And I'm from a different world anyway, so, you know, I just leaned back for the first couple of years.  I played my cards right, let them cast me and stuff, you know what I'm saying?  Let them put the lipstick on me and the dresses on me and all of that.  Cut my balls off, you know, and all of that stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  But then after a while, then all the heavy hitters started breaking out, so I just said, you know, I stepped up.  I stepped right in there.  Yeah.  And I'm glad it happened like that because, you know, then I got my own TV show, which got canceled after 22 episodes. 
[02:08:30]  What happened?  You did 22, though.  I don't know.  You would have to ask NBC.  I got 22, but, you know, when I went out to L.A., my vagina was nice and pretty.  Now I look like a orangutan back there.  You know, the big pig orangutan cootie cat.  I got the big baboon cootie cat now.  Red and sore.  I mean, you know, it was nice and pretty when I got out there, you know.  I saw you on Sharon Osbourne's show cooking, what were you cooking, like little beans and franks? 
[02:09:00]  It was really funny, man.  Pork and beans and franks with grape Kool-Aid.  It was really funny.  That's a ghetto delicacy, man.  That's a ghetto delicacy.  It's called franks and bean casserole with grape Kool-Aid.  Grape Kool-Aid, of course.  With a little slice of lemon in it.  And I got to cook a sweet potato pie because when you get these TV shows, you do a lot of press.  Yeah.  I mean, you amp up.  I mean, NBC pulled out all the stops. 
[02:09:30]  You know, I was the next Cosby show and all of that stuff.  So I got to cook a sweet potato pie with Bo Jackson and everything.  Really?  You know I'm on the anti-doping committee for comedians.  I didn't know that.  So if you're smoking marijuana before you set, I'm going to see you out there.  You're going to be tested in these clubs.  You know who's going to be the surprise witness in this Michael Jackson case, right?  It's going to be Bubbles.  I know.  They're very distracting, aren't they?  What are you guys doing?  The chimp.  Just leave all that shit alone right now.  The chimp going to pull the zipper down. 
[02:10:00]  It's going to be Jim Brewer.  It's going to be Jim Brewer in the chimp suit.  You're going to see Michael Jackson.  The bailiff is going to walk Bubbles down the aisle.  And Bubbles is going to glimpse at Mike.  Mike going to turn the defense table over and say,  You banana-eating chimpanzee witness protection program.  You be eating bananas in Alaska.  I'm done with you.  What do you think, Mike?  And Bubbles is going to say,  No, no, I've seen it all, Your Honor. 
[02:10:30]  I've seen it all.  Yes, he touched one of them boys over there by the teacups.  Yeah, one of them little boys by the giraffe enclosement.  You went for a year on the show.  I actually didn't see it.  It's great.  Did they write stuff that you didn't like?  Or were you happy with the final product and it just didn't get ratings?  I didn't see it.  Of course.  I was a black dude.  But what I'm going to say.  They wrote stuff that you thought was like this.  I'm quite sure the slaves didn't want to pick cotton either.  Well, slaves didn't make 30 grand a week.  I bet you the slaves were smoking weed. 
[02:11:00]  They used to stop in the middle of picking and go,  You see all this cotton we've got to pick?  Get high, man.  We can't pick all this cotton sober.  You're looking at that Egg McMuffin there, huh?  That's a sausage.  That's a sausage.  So much for no carbs.  It smells really good.  No, thanks, man.  Wait, someone is saying that you had the funniest line ever on SNL.  What?  Scott in Chicago.  If it's about Brittany.  Hey.  Hey.  I think Tracy delivered the funniest line in the history of Saturday Night Live. 
[02:11:30]  I love you.  God bless you so much.  When you did Astronaut Jones and she was the alien asking for help to save her planet.  I said, why don't you turn around and show me that big fat ass?  Big fat ass?  Remember the whole sketch?  I was like, yeah, right.  I said not stop.  What was that like?  Was she pissed about that or?  Who?  Nah, they loved it, baby.  They loved it.  Didn't you improv that?  That wasn't the original line.  You added to that line.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did a lot.  I used to do that all the time.  And Brittany didn't have a problem with that? 
[02:12:00]  Nah, I tongue kissed Brittany about six, seven times.  That whole week.  Because I was doing, but that wasn't that.  When I used to do Woodrow, which was the guy that lived in the sewer.  He got the girls, but you know, I got to kiss him.  I kissed Lucy Liu.  And I would, like, try to put my tongue in they mouth.  Like, at the time, she was dating Justin.  He was standing right there, and I dared him to say something.  You know the reason why Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston broke up, right?  Me.  Yep.  Stop calling the house, Brad. 
[02:12:30]  Leave it alone, okay?  It's over.  Stop calling the house.  She's pregnant by me.  Leave it alone.  Just leave it alone.  Walk away, Brad.  Would you smell her ass, Jennifer?  Come on, man.  Jennifer Aniston could fart in my mouth.  I'm a freak, baby.  I'm a freak.  He's old school filthy.  I love Tracy.  I'm a weedy, beedy, bing-bong freak.  Come over here and fart in my mouth.  That's great.  Get over here.  Hud J. Law at the same time.  Poop right in my mouth.  I'm a weedy, beedy, bing-bong freak. 
[02:13:00]  What do you think about Britney being pregnant there, Tracy?  That's my child.  Really?  That's going to be a surprise.  Everything's going to come out.  All the facts are going to come out.  That's going to be a surprise.  That body's getting ruined, though.  Nah, that's the way I like it.  Yeah?  Stretch marks and all that.  It's the mark of womanhood.  I like cellulite.  Any woman that go against cellulite is going against womanhood.  That's all about it.  Hey, that got to be jelly, because jam don't shake like that.  You like a woman after she's had a kid or two?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't like nothing new. 
[02:13:30]  No?  But my money.  I want a woman that's been through the fire.  Through the fire.  Really?  You don't like them all nice and tight?  Hey, listen.  I'm not a scorer.  I'm a rebounder.  If you're coming out of bad relations, come see me.  I'm Matt Catalans.  Come see me.  Hey, I take kids.  I accept kids.  All of that.  Forced to care.  Come see me.  If you're getting social security checks with one of them kids, give me half. 
[02:14:00]  I'll take care of your life.  Well, you don't see many guys like that.  Yes.  I'm a rebounder.  I'll dive over the scoring table for a rebound.  Happy lessons.  I'm with it.  I like it as a bonus if you've got crust on the back of your feet.  Oh, God.  With that little black welfare toenail at the end.  That is really nasty, man.  See the women wearing the sandals or something in the store?  They're shuffling along, and there's just that big calloused, crusty thing on the back of their heels. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, you like that?  That's sexy.  It's like yellowish, white.  You know what you mean?  You ain't made love until you had a woman that's in a vegetated state or something.  I don't like resistance, man.  I like to get straight to the point.  Like a Terry Schiavo kind of?  When your fucking alarm just flop over the side of the bed and doubles.  You know, that's what you like to be dangling over your shoulders and stuff.  I had this one chick that was, you know, one crippled chick.  That was my thing.  Really?  Hey, man.  And sex is a sexy thing when you sneak up into ICU. 
[02:15:00]  Sneak up.  Yeah.  And have sex with a woman with IVs hanging out of her arms.  That's sexy.  Yeah.  You know what they say?  Sometimes white guys like to drive around and find black prostitutes and break their arm.  Really?  Sadistic white dudes from the suburbs.  Break the arm.  Break that arm.  Why?  When they get having oral sex, they just break that arm.  Some guys, some white guys get off on that.  I never heard that.  I've never heard that in my life.  It's tragic.  You never seen a prostitute with a cast on? 
[02:15:30]  I've seen some prostitutes with their cast.  Cause, yeah, the jaw broke her arm.  That's cause a white guy?  That's a jaw broke her arm.  I always assumed it was the pimp or something.  No, the pimp don't care.  He sent her to the hospital to get that cast on.  Then all the other chicks on the strip signed her cast.  You ever seen a baby with a cast on?  That's dark, right?  I love dark.  That's pretty sad.  Dark.  You always assumed it was something bad.  I was the one that told Luke Skywalker, F. Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Really?  We're going to hang out with the Emperor and Darth Vader. 
[02:16:00]  That's where the party's at.  We're going to the Death Star.  I booed Star Wars.  Why?  Cause Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Yeah?  Damn, man.  The Force be with you.  Come on, man.  Emperor, Darth Vader.  You seen that suit?  You seen Obi-Wan Kenobi's suit?  Did you see Darth Vader's suit?  Darth Vader got fashion.  He probably redid that.  Fuck.  Sean John made that Darth Vader suit.  You know Papa Smurf was a bad drinker? 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  He has two domestic violence charges for putting his hands on Smurfette.  He drove a cutler's Sierra.  You can change directions.  He's all over the road today.  He knocked down two or three mushrooms over in Smurfette trying to park that car one night.  Don't we got to play for Tracy?  Do you know Batman and Robin really didn't get along?  Um-be-know-ins.  Um-be-know-ins.  Because Robin smoked Smurfette lights and he burnt the hole in the bat seat in the passenger  side. 
[02:17:00]  And Batman begged him.  First of all, there was a lot of resentment there because Robin didn't ever have a belt.  No, he didn't have an utility belt.  He hated Commissioner Gordon.  He thought Commissioner Gordon was a jerk.  This is what Robin, he said he's a jerk.  Yeah?  He keeps putting the bat signal in the air.  How do you think you're joking him?  No, we coming.  Why don't you just use the phone?  That's why Verizon installed him.  He had a big cock, by the way, Robin.  Yeah.  Legendarily big cock.  He had to wear two little things to keep it from bulging out.  Oh, really?  Come on. 
[02:17:30]  It's like Janet Jackson.  You know, one titty popping out?  Come on.  That's comedy.  If both would have popped out, we would have been like, oh, that's sexy.  But one is like, oh, a titty popped out.  That was, for me, I mean, America went crazy.  But that was just like two black chicks having to fight.  You know, whoever titty popped out, that's the winner.  She went for her.  She went for her.  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, Hagi, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas. 
[02:18:00]  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is fuck my dick,  because they ain't give me no money.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Radio, Cash Up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop punching me.  Fuck you, bitch.  Squeeze in one more bit here, Anthony.  Dee Dee.  We love Dee Dee.  Dee Dee, who thought the first time we had Dee Dee on the show  that she was such a freak?  Did you know, didn't she come across as a very wholesome,  very withdrawn kind of girl?  Very shy? 
[02:18:30]  We were wrong.  She's got stories that rival sailors.  She talks about this time she was so fucked up.  No, no, that's the beauty of what they wrote on this one, too.  Dee Dee, crazy stories.  The boys dig deeper with Dee Dee and find out that The used to be a big druggie who once  got so fucked, she woke up in Vegas, married, and didn't even remember.  How do you get so fucked that you go that far west?  Was the guy just jamming at homes and they were moving across America like six inches 
[02:19:00]  at a time?  Yeah.  To the point she got so fucked that she ended up in Vegas?  He fucked her all the way to Vegas?  That's what I'm saying.  Is that what they're saying here?  Well, that's what it says.  The boys dig deeper with Dee Dee and find out, I'll fix the typo here, Anthony, find  out that she used to be a big druggie who once got so fucked, she woke up in Vegas, married,  and didn't even remember.  That's fucked.  That means she was on her back all the way from Washington to Vegas.  To Vegas.  Six inches at a time.  She decided to stay with the guy anyway to see if it would work out. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  Here it is on The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  In studio, we have Dee Dee.  Hello.  Hey, Dee Dee.  Dee Dee's back.  Now, you were telling some kind of crazy story in the other room, and everyone's like, you  got to hear the story.  Well, way back when, about 10, no, 11 and a half years ago or so, I was living in L.A.  at the time, and I used to go to Vegas a lot, so I took a trip to Vegas one weekend, woke 
[02:20:00]  up one morning to find out that I was married to a British guy.  It kind of came out of an alcoholic, drug state of mind.  Wow.  I know.  I look over, and he's like, so how does it feel to be married?  And I guess the day before, I was at the courthouse, ended up married, had no clue, and my fucked  up mind at the time thought, well, he's cute, he has an accent, he's from England, this could  work.  So we went back to L.A.  He had a lot of money on him, cash in the house, and he was leaving for a ski trip.  He told me to keep the money safe, so he left, and I didn't feel safe with it in the house, 
[02:20:30]  so, you know, take it to the savings account, right?  So I'm at the bank.  The bank teller's like, wait a minute, next thing I know, I'm dealing with the Secret Service.  It was counterfeit money.  And then, needless to say, he's back in England.  Wow.  But you know what, I'm thankful, you know, I'm grateful to the Secret Service, too, because he's  like, you gotta get your shit together, or else you're gonna end up dead, so I haven't  had a mind-altering substance for 11 years.  Ooh, good.  Wow. 
[02:21:00]  All right, wait a minute, there's so much to this story.  Yeah, yeah, I'm glad you laid it out there, but now we gotta dig in a little bit.  Just a bit.  Just a bit.  Vegas, all right, you're in Vegas for what?  You're just there?  Just there to hang out.  Now, you aren't with this guy?  No.  So you met the guy in Vegas?  I guess so, I wasn't, you know.  You don't even remember meeting this guy?  Have you ever been in an alcoholic blackout?  Well, you don't recall anything, it's like a part of your life that never comes back.  Steve, put your hand down.  Yeah.  Jeez, Steve's all like, yeah, me, I have. 
[02:21:30]  Ben's saying nobody's in one now.  No, so I don't recall, I don't even remember being at the courthouse.  Let me ask you something, I'm not to interrupt you, but you could have actually said something  like, something, something, party rocks, and you wouldn't even remember.  I couldn't be having a conversation right now, and I would never remember.  Yeah.  So, you were in Vegas, you're getting a little drunk.  You went there just for the weekend to gamble and stuff?  Among other things, yeah.  What kind of drug was your drug of choice back then? 
[02:22:00]  Coke, crystal meth, stuff like that.  Crystal meth?  Yeah.  You know, L.A., California.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Coke doesn't really get you where you don't know what you're doing.  Yeah, but crystal meth was cheaper then, so.  Crystal meth.  Yeah, even that, though, kind of gets you alert.  It doesn't, you must have been really drunk.  Yeah, but then, like, I was, the alcohol.  What were you drinking?  When I used to drink gin and tonics.  Gin and tonics.  Wow.  Midori.  Would people consider you a lightweight or a heavy drinker, like?  See, I was a functioning alcoholic.  Yeah.  Where I could go through the week fine, but I black out when I drink, so I'm an alcoholic. 
[02:22:30]  You don't have to explain it.  We know.  So you didn't know all about functioning alcoholics.  So you completely black out where you're walking around, you're talking, you're doing  things.  I'm functioning.  But you have no clue what you're doing.  Exactly.  And you wake up the next day.  I get married and, you know.  So you were packed.  Did the English guy ever tell you how you met or?  Yeah, at the roulette table at Circus Circus. 
[02:23:00]  So you must have been drunk and playing roulette, and he walked over, and did he fill you in?  It was sometime in the afternoon, like around, I don't know, maybe one, two in the afternoon.  In the afternoon, and you're smashed to the point of not remembering anything.  Right.  It was Las Vegas.  Wow.  Of course.  D.D., party rock.  Party rock.  Wow.  So apparently this guy comes over and starts talking to you.  And, wow, you sound like, in those states of mind, you may have been a bit promiscuous. 
[02:23:30]  I guess so.  I guess so.  He was in my bed, so, and I was married to him.  Oh, yeah.  Well, now, did you do anything before you got married?  Like, did you have sex with him, as far as you know, and then get married?  Or did you say, I'm not doing this unless I'm married?  I don't know.  I was, like, blacked out.  But still, to this day, he never filled you in on a timeline?  Didn't you say, hey, hubby, could you tell me how this? 
[02:24:00]  Well, he just said, you know, we met, and we had some fun, and I'm like, let's get married.  I'm like, okay.  So, yeah, you met, had some fun.  Did you really get married, though?  Yes, I'll bring in the, I'll make a copy of the marriage.  Well, obviously, it's been annulled, I mean.  Well, obviously, you can't if you did the deed, so no.  Wait, you can't annul it even if you did it in a passed out, drunken stupidity?  Well, because in my fucked up mind, this was going to work.  He was my man.  Oh, so instead of getting it annulled, you figured, let's make this work.  Right.  I was so fucked up on drugs, I thought.  Because it was based on something so pure and honest and loving. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, he's cute.  He has an accent.  He's from England.  This could work.  That's all you need, really.  Who did he look like, as far as maybe somebody that we know, celebrity-wise?  Anyone?  Even close?  Probably looked like Captain Morgan.  No.  Wearing a pirate suit.  I don't know.  God, you know, I'm trying to think.  Who did he match up with?  So you go back to L.A., how long did you live with him? 
[02:25:00]  A few months.  A few months?  Yeah.  Wow, she really tried to.  So you were banging this guy, huh, when you got back to L.A.?  Hello, here's my husband, yeah.  Was he any good?  He's English.  Oh, here's my husband.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He was English, though.  Was he any good in this act?  Yeah.  See, I have a thing for accents.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Wow, how about that?  This chick is just amazing.  You're amazing.  You really are.  You're married, and he had a house in L.A.? 
[02:25:30]  I had the place.  You had the place.  He was from England, so he had nothing.  Wait, he had nothing?  He had counterfeit money.  He had counterfeit American cash.  That I didn't know.  So you take him back to England.  You didn't ask him where he was staying when he was in the U.S.?  No.  How long was he in the U.S. before?  When you're on drugs, you don't care.  Wait, you don't even know how long your husband for a few months was in?  You never sat down with him and said, hey, how long have you been in America?  No, you don't understand.  Where did you live before you married me?  I don't know.  I was so fucked up. 
[02:26:00]  I didn't care at that time.  You don't understand.  That was a different time in my life.  I was really fucked up.  Amazing.  I didn't care about a lot of shit.  I am amazed at this.  So he moves into your place.  She's going to give Jim Norton a run for his money.  I know.  The deeper we delve into this, Jim, you are a freak.  So you go, he moves into your house.  Yes.  Were you, I know you were all fucked up, but were you troubled by anything?  The fact that maybe he didn't work or?  He had money.  He had money. 
[02:26:30]  I didn't know it was counterfeit, but I guess he was involved with things I didn't know.  How much money did he have?  It was a lot.  How much?  How much did you take to the bank with you?  Well, I took like 10 grand in cash.  Uh-huh.  Pop in a savings account?  But he had a lot more than that?  But it would be safer there in the savings account.  That was my mentality back then.  He goes on drugs.  So all of a sudden he's like, I'm going.  He should have said, you know, I'm going on a ski trip.  Keep this money safe.  By the way, it's counterfeit.  He left that out.  So he went on a ski trip?  Yes.  All right.  And he had a bag of dough there? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Why didn't you go with him?  Because I was working.  Oh.  What were you doing at the time?  I was working on a show called The Mo Show, Mo Gaffney.  She's a comedian actress.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And she had a talk show at the time.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So.  Wow.  So he goes on a ski trip and there's, how much money was in the house, do you think?  Ten grand.  Oh, it was just ten grand.  Well, what I brought to the bank was about ten grand.  But how much was.  How much total counterfeit money did he have?  Oh, I don't know.  He had a lot.  Was it.  There was something.  Hundreds of thousands or a million or.  There was a lot. 
[02:27:30]  How much?  Over a hundred thousand?  I don't know.  There was a lot though.  He was living.  It's a lot.  Comfortably.  Was he printing it in the States or.  I don't know.  Distributing or printing.  You didn't see anything about it.  Secret Service never told you how far into it this guy was.  No, he.  The Secret Service dude was like, you know, obviously had no clue that it was counterfeit  because why would you bring it to the bank?  Yeah.  It was really cool.  Kind of a dopey move for somebody that knew it was counterfeit.  I'm going to get interest on this.  And he's like, well.  Well, he knew I was fucked up.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  He could see it.  Sure.  So he's like, you got to get your shit together or else you're going to end up dead.  And then I got my shit together.  Right after that?  And I'm not dead.  I'm here.  Right after that you got your shit together?  Well, it took about a month and then, yeah.  And then I was at home crying one night because I knew I had a problem and I called 411 and  got the number for a 12-step program.  You did?  Yeah.  And it all worked out for you?  And the female Stuart Smalley.  Yeah.  Wow.  So was this guy in jail overseas or anything?  He had to go back. 
[02:28:30]  Deported.  Yeah.  But that's all that happens to you if you're called with counterfeit money?  He was in a little bit of trouble, but he just went back.  He couldn't come back here.  Do you miss him?  No.  They probably won't extradite you for something like that, will they, from England?  Like send you back to face trial here?  I don't know.  No, they didn't do it.  I don't know who he knows, but he had just to go back.  Wow.  You were hanging with James Bond, I think.  James Bond.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he was, yeah.  That's a great story. 
[02:29:00]  My past.  This is the night.  That is your past, isn't it?  Wow.  Yeah.  And do you have pictures, a wedding picture and stuff?  I'll bring in a picture of him.  I got it.  Not a wedding picture, but of him.  A picture of him?  Yeah.  God, your story continues for the Opie and Anthony program.  Next time we run into you, we've got to see the wedding photos.  Got to see the picture.  All right.  Well, are you ready for the news?  Sure.  I don't have to do that.  People are asking, did you ever tell these stories on XM Kids?  No.  When you were broadcasting.  Hey, kids.  No, because I was a good kid show host. 
[02:29:30]  I was in a drunken stupor.  That's a pretty roulette wheel.  Let me tell you the time cricket muled heroin through Columbia.  Oh, no.  I feel better about myself, because I really thought we were responsible for you losing  your XM Kids gig, but now I see that you have such a shady past that it was just a  matter of time.  Just a matter of time before they caught on.  She's helping John Malkovich stockpile cash so we can murder the president.  Yeah.  I thought she was sweet and innocent, and we brought her down this road.  She's been on this road for years. 
[02:30:00]  And I'll tell you about my threesome with Pat O'Brien.  Great.  Her book is all, it's called Puppets, Coke, and British Cock.  British Cock.  And now we know where that came from, too.  Down the mirror.  What are you laughing at?  I'm not laughing.  Yeah, so.  What a story.  Yeah, my mom knows that I was married, so. 
[02:30:30]  She knows the reasons why, because of your drug use and stuff.  Yeah, she, yeah.  And then I went back home to the Joliet for help, so.  Yeah, and that's where you kind of dried out, went back home.  Dried out, yeah.  To dry out.  Wow.  And you haven't drank or anything?  For, um, celebrated.  March 10th was my anniversary.  March 10th, 1994.  We got to get her drunk one day.  No.  Do you ever have the urge?  No, in the first few years, yeah, but no, no. 
[02:31:00]  First few years.  Wow.  Yeah.  There's got to be other things that have happened to you during these blackouts where you woke  up and went, oh my God, what am I, what am I doing?  How about we save it for the next hour?  Oh, come on.  I got it.  The face she's making is like, uh-oh, there's a basketball team involved.  Do you ever come out of it naked and go, wait, you're not white.  Hey, neither are you.  All right, you want to hear another one?  I definitely want to hear a blackout story.  Yeah, give us one more blackout story. 
[02:31:30]  I was working in Philly.  God, she goes right into it.  Oh, bam.  Bam.  She's doing them alphabetically.  I was working at Philly one time at Eagle 106 back in the day, and friends of mine were  working in New Orleans, and they're like, oh, it would be great to see you.  I'm like, yeah, you too.  And the next thing I know, I don't remember booking the flight, getting on the plane, but  I'm in New Orleans.  And the reason why I knew I was there is because all of a sudden I hear a knock on the door,  and I'm like, where am I?  Obviously, I had to use the bathroom. 
[02:32:00]  I'm in a gas station in New Orleans, and that's how I found out I was in New Orleans.  I'm like, how long have I been here?  So you're just in a gas station, someone knocking on the door because they've got to take a leave.  I had to use the bathroom, yeah.  And that's when you came out of your blackout, and you looked around and went, where am I?  Yeah.  And what did you walk out and go, where am I?  Pretty much to the gas station.  How did you find out you were actually in New Orleans?  He told me, the gas station attendant.  That is a good buzz.  And then I called my friend, and I'm like, I'm here. 
[02:32:30]  And she's like, yeah, I know, but we lost you on Bourbon Street or whatever.  Oh, wow.  Holy Jesus.  She's just like quantum leaping all over the country.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, just wake up.  That's got to be something.  I've never blacked out.  I've never.  You're not an alcoholic.  I've passed out, like I've been maybe feeling sick, and you go into the bathroom after a night of all tequila or something like that, and then you wake up with a tile floor impression on your face.  Like, wow, I passed out here in the bathroom. 
[02:33:00]  But you know that you were in the bathroom getting sick and everything like that.  But the thought of, like, hours going by, plane trips, different cities, Bourbon Street, and then you just snap out of it in a bathroom in a gas station.  Wow.  Yeah.  You're getting your money's worth out of that booze.  I feel cheated.  Well, I guess it was a hurricane.  She's perfect.  Oh, a hurricane.  Those are great.  Those are strong again.  She's perfect for this radio show.  We call it the Ben's hair.  The Ben's hair.  We found another misfit.  Yep.  Hi.  No, don't be sorry.  Be proud. 
[02:33:30]  It's the worst.  There won't be an Anthony.  Anthony, you just reminded me of something.  It's a quickie.  All right.  A quick hi, mom.  Which one is that?  Hi, mom.  I got fired from work for masturbating.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play hi, mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  All right.  Relax.  What?  Jim's pointing at me.  Is that your voice?  Yeah, it is.  Oh, God.  I started radio when I was 12.  Yeah, listen to that.  Hey. 
[02:34:00]  Hey.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, we got your mom on the phone.  That was very hurtful, Jim.  I just didn't sound like you.  I couldn't believe that was you.  You weren't sure, and you're pointing at me.  Is that your voice?  Who is that?  I'm like, yeah, it's my voice.  Hey, we're the only station that really rocks.  You're listening to Hobie and Anthony's show.  The Ethel Merman and Anthony show.  Things are swell.  We got your mom on the phone. 
[02:34:30]  Well, I don't know.  I think when we used to record stuff back then, it recorded just slightly fast.  Is that it?  Because there's a lot of old stuff that just sounds sped up a bit.  Oh, high voice, Jim.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play high, Mom.  I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Hello?  What's the problem now? 
[02:35:00]  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Good luck.  All right, all right.  All right.  Autumn turns to winter, and winter turns to spring.  It's not just season, you know, it goes for everything.  Where's Opie's part?  Is that him?  Yeah, no.  You've got to take a lesson from Mother Nature, and if you do, you'll know. 
[02:35:30]  When it's time to change, then it's time to change.  You've got your mom on the phone.  When it's time to come along for the ride, don't you see?  When it's time to change, then it's time to be arranged.  When it's time to change, then it's time to change.  What you're going to be?  Chana-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Chana-na-na-na-na-na-na.

A girl's a woman, too.  And if you want to reach your destiny, you're the one you've got to do.  Dad has AIDS, you know.  Dad has AIDS.  I'm like the guy's going along for the ride.

You'll be dead by spring.  Easier to bury you in summer because the ground isn't frozen.  Oh, it's time to change.  Change.  You're the worst at rhyming.  I wasn't supposed to rhyme.  I know.

[02:40:30]  We're going to have some yummy treats, too.  Angel dust.  Acid.  LSD.  Cocaine.  Car.  ACP.  Calent.  Cracking.  Today, we're going to learn all about...  A whale's vagina.  And a special surprise for one lucky audience member.  Oh, yuck!  It's a doggy-poo.  So come aboard, kids.  Put on your laughing hats and tea bag of relatives.  It's Opie and Anthony's Funhouse.  You fucking puppet.  Isn't that lovely?  You guys are enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're going to have another live show tomorrow morning. 
[02:41:00]  We took a long weekend here.  To relax and enjoy our lives.  Am I right or wrong?  Right.  We had to recharge the batteries, as they say.  Good point.  Do we actually have batteries, though?  No.  That need recharging?  No.  Where did that term come from?  I think so.  That saying?  It was probably taken after batteries were invented, and somebody compared themselves  to the appliance and said, when I recharge the batteries, the appliance works better.  It works a little better.  My body is kind of like a battery if I recharge it.  Yeah.  We're a little like the appliance.  Did I say that?  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  You said appliance.  Appliant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was nodding.  Yes.  Anyway, Patrice, friend of the show, was in with Vinny, a friend of the show who owns  the Stress Factory down there in New Brunswick, and Patrice and Vinny just went at it.  Why?  They came into the studio kind of having a little tension there.  It's a really weird psychological thing.  Patrice is an abrasive asshole, and Vinny loves confrontation.  That's who they are, and they actually like each other, but Patrice doesn't get along well 
[02:42:00]  with almost anybody, and Vinny, I once saw bite a man's finger, because Vinny is a psychopath.  You wouldn't know it, but he is a psychopath.  Really?  Loves confrontation.  So this is like trying to mix vinegar and that other thing.  Whatever makes a douche, that's exactly what those two are.  Vinegar and a thing with a nozzle.  That's who you have with those two.  Another stupid saying.  It's like trying to mix vinegar and oil.  Trying to mix oil and water.  I bet you it's never going to mix.  Oil and water don't mix. 
[02:42:30]  Less, of course, to the minivan that's going backwards into a lake.  Then oil and water do mix, along with tears and wispy blonde hairs.  All right, listen.  We're going backwards.  Hey, we're going backwards.  Patrice and Vinny go at it on The Worst of Opian Anthony.  Say, Jim, what nice feels.  The Worst of Opian Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  I say, don't you know?  You say you don't know.  I say, I say.  I mean, you're a celebrity, Norty. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, whatever.  Vinny, over there.  We're back with the Opian Anthony program.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  Good morning.  I'm not a celebrity.  A very, very, very, very funny guy.  Good morning.  Who's playing the Stress Factory all this weekend.  Tonight, tomorrow.  7-3-2-5-4-5.  Ha-ha.  H-A-H-A.  And the owner of the club is in studio, Vinny.  Yes, Vinny Brand, also a comic and a good friend.  Very funny guy.  In his own right, yes.  And he was making fun of Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:43:30]  Basically saying, Patrice, say something because you're not selling tickets.  Mm-hmm.  That's what you get.  I can't figure out how to be a celebrity.  Dude, do you know how awful I was?  I went on sale at the Bogota.  Do you understand that, like, an hour and a half later, there were still 40 tickets left?  I'm like, what do I have to do?  Hi, you dick.  It's a shame.  I've been on.  Look, if this was the 80s, somebody would know me.  No, no one would know you.  Not even in the 80s.  Oh, look at that awful haircut Vinny has.  I'll tell you, they can't see that radio, you fucking idiot.  Yes, they can.  They can feel my pain watching that stupid bull cut. 
[02:44:00]  The Frankenstein head.  Oh, Vinny.  That really is a prank phone call kind of head.  Oh, it's a prank call, buddy.  Leave me alone on the fucking phone call.  Without the phone call, your show sucks.  That's the owner of the club telling the headliner he stinks.  He stinks.  Wow, way to sell the show this week.  Here's the part that bothers me.  Matrice is definitely funny.  Nobody fucking cares or knows.  Whatever he's doing, it doesn't fucking help. 
[02:44:30]  I don't get it.  I do not get it.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Tomorrow's sold out.  We have a Sweet 16 party coming in.  150 people.  Great.  Are you serious?  They'll never come to the club again.  So you can get sued.  Is that the wrong crowd for him?  I'm only kidding.  I mean, I wouldn't let him come in.  I would not let him come in.  There's young girls in that party.  Well, there you go.  Patrice is not a nice person.  It's the best of both worlds.  Vinny's a comic and a club owner.  This is beautiful.  Patrice has an inside track on all the hackness.  Patrice has been on a self-destruction mode lately with the clubs, too.  I love it.  Just chasing people out.  Two weeks ago.  I love it.  Two weeks ago at the comic strip, I'm on the showroom. 
[02:45:00]  I swear to God, a girl left the fucking club crying.  Not just crying.  She was boo-hooing.  She was running out.  And her boyfriend walking out with no balls whatsoever.  You walked how many people that night?  One.  Two.  No.  Her.  No.  Four.  All right.  There were six people in the audience.  Going to comic mode when we were at the comedy clubs doing comedy.  No comic counts that.  Just for that, I'm going to walk the 30 people that are going to show up this weekend.  And it's not a matter of not being funny. 
[02:45:30]  It's just that they are offended and upset.  It's not that the jokes aren't good.  It's that he's just a cocksucker and nobody likes him.  No.  That's true.  The people that stay have a great time.  I told you I was in the hospital.  There was a candlelight visual for my death.  They were praying for my death.  Oh, believe me.  As soon as you woke up, people were like, fuck.  Fuck.  Fat motherfucker.  Prayer ain't shit. 
[02:46:00]  You know how many comedy shows and comics are going, come on.  Taking bets on my death.  No, not me.  I'm just paying you.  Why do you and your friends hate me so much, Vinny?  I don't hate you as much as you think.  But I am paying you with a check this weekend in case you drop on Monday.  Oh, Jesus.  And you know what's piss making me mad?  That cocked this mother...  He tried that out on me.  Really?  You don't try material out on me and then...  You never said it?  Yeah.  There's two fucking things I want.  Number one, if you drop on Monday, that wouldn't be terrible. 
[02:46:30]  And I'd like that little recorder.  That little fucking Sony recorder.  I'd like that to be mine.  And the funny thing is, I heard it last night when I was there.  He said it again.  He certainly did.  I had a baseball bat to the back of your head.  Come prepared.  Oh.  See, that's a tough crowd reference.  Him and his smarmy friends all used to say, I never was prepared for a tough crowd.  What is Anthony Clark doing outside the studio?  Who is that guy?  That's a little scary.  Well, Patrice was in the hospital.  That's right.  You're all good now?  Yeah, I mean...  Taking care of yourself?  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  No, you're not.  You're not.  You're going to eat like a fucking pig.  You have no control.  No, I'm not.  Wow.  You have no fucking control.  I'll tell you how I'm going to live.  Doesn't like you.  Not eating that awful food at your goddamn place.  Right or wrong.  That's not...  That's fucking wrong.  Why don't you have the guy pick the fries up off the floor against me?  With his fingers.  Look at his face.  He's trying to laugh, but he's like, come on, dude.  Don't mess up my fry business.  Jackass.  Oh, 100% pure olive oil.  Yeah, you jackass.  Let me tell you, I'll be feeding you fries and wings and all kinds of fattening shit.  That's right.  I'll write that check. 
[02:47:30]  Have a fucking order to go.  Drink this.  What is it?  It's just grease.  Go ahead.  It's fine.  It's fucking melted lard with a straw.  Apply that to your heart and go to sleep.  This is just awful.  He's just not selling tickets for you, huh, Vinny?  Well, tomorrow's good.  Tonight'll be good.  He'll sell tickets tonight.  Black people don't reserve an event.  They don't fucking plan.  And I'm the only one of one and a half black people Vinny has in the club. 
[02:48:00]  That's not true.  I use Wally Collins, too.  That's the half.  One and a half.  One and a half black guy in the year.  Jesus, Vinny.  No, that's not true.  I use a lot of black comments.  Vinny's got a great club.  I like Vinny's club.  And the food's good.  Is it not good, Obi?  There's a pay phone on the wall.  What are you going to do?  Dude, that fucking phone really rocks you.  That really upsets you.  You can't file a goddamn prank phone call.  I hate that stupid...  I don't have to.  The middle has to, and I feel bad for him. 
[02:48:30]  Vinny sees it at his own club, and he does a prank call before he leaves the stage.  Hello.  Yes, Mrs. R.  Mrs. R.  This is Johnny from the...  This is the police...  How many police...  R.N.  New Brunswick.  Every day he's a cop.  I'm a policeman.  Uh-oh.  Speaking of mumbling.  Welcome back to the O.B. and Vinny show.  Thank you.  That's Vinny from the Stress Factor.  That's Vinny Rand.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:49:00]  You didn't recognize me?  I'm trying to care.  He really wants you out of his seat.  Vinny, sit in your old chair.  Get out of Anthony's seat.  Who told you to sit there?  We did put you out there on purpose.  You want your chair back?  I'll fucking move.  I have to.  Anthony doesn't know what to do with himself when someone's sitting in his seat.  Look at Anthony's fresh new gums.  Mary Jane Rodden Keith. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, my God.  You feel better?  Oh, that's amazing.  Oh, man.  How number are you?  Here's the picture.  Ooh, that doesn't look good.  Nice and white, though.  Which one's the bad one, both?  The second one down.  Yeah, there's this one.  That's the bad one?  Yeah, right down there at the bottom.  Oh, yeah.  He's emailing me this.  He missed a nerve.  How can you miss a nerve?  Did he leave it in on purpose, or is that like a mistake?  The dentist fucked up.  My old dentist must have been a, this is going to be really fun to talk like this. 
[02:50:00]  He can't feel his bottom jaw.  Look at him.  My first dentist was a hack, I guess.  Really?  This guy's good.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  How can you tell that this thing down?  Yeah, well, I was in pain, I'm not.  I went to him.  He's fantastic.  He's the best.  Pain's gone.  He's great.  How can you tell that this right here is something?  So it looks just like a shadow.  He knows.  He knows, huh? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Training.  How numb are you?  He's a doctor.  Your throat?  No, like, like, the whole right side of my bottom jaw up to, yeah, the back of the  jaw.  Not the throat, though.  Now I've got to go for Root Canal right after the show.  But wasn't that a Root Canal?  Right next door.  Oh, you're going to stay in the city and do it here?  Yeah.  The specialist?  Yeah.  Wasn't that a Root Canal?  The thing he's saying is a problem was a Root Canal? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, but they didn't go far enough down.  Twelve years ago when they did it.  You know, it's going to really hurt.  Oof.  No.  Yeah, it's going to really hurt.  Now, once the nerve is gone, it's a wrap.  It's going to hurt.  It won't hurt.  I know.  I've had those.  No, it's going to really hurt.  You're not scaring me.  I've had them before.  You've had them?  I've had them.  Anthony, listen to me.  Crest?  I understand.  Or Listerine?  Just something.  Do something to your mouth.  Will you just...  I understand.  I've had a couple of Root Canal.  You know, you joke about piss, but it really does clean you right out. 
[02:51:30]  Does it?  Nor does it complain.  Ding!  No cavities ever?  I had one.  That's why I'm joking with you, because you're in pain.  You have to.  But, you know, I had mine happen in, like, I was out of the country.  It's in third world country, and I had one of those.  In Brazil, right?  Yep.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Like, three in the morning, I went to, like, one of those favelas.  It was the City of God to have them.  I went to the City of God and had them.  Little dice.  Little dice was digging a hole in my mouth. 
[02:52:00]  I went there, it was like three in the morning, and I found a...  I had to.  It was that much pain.  LZ, DTS.  No Novocaine, right?  No, cocaine.  Yeah.  Coke.  Just rub coke on your gum.  Rub coke.  And right down to the Monte Carlo.  Archaic instrument.  They distract you.  A little poor boy tries to steal your wallet when you go, hey!  They just fucking pull your tooth out.  You have to have the doctor fill out a form to ask if he has AIDS.  A little country. 
[02:52:30]  You only have one cavity in your life?  One, yeah.  Wow.  That's amazing.  With genetics, but I got high blood pressure.  Yeah, I was going to say, you're going to take care of anything else.  Yeah, that's the, you know.  And the coffin, your teeth are going to look great.  Look at his teeth.  They're fucking beautiful.  Beautiful.  His heart's enlarged, but his teeth are fantastic.  Look how big his heart is. 
[02:53:00]  Patrice's always had a big heart.  You missed out.  These two have been just going at it.  Yeah.  Because he owns the club, and he's not selling tickets for them this weekend.  Oh, my God.  So they're just killing each other.  Oh, boy.  Patrice, that's the stress factor this weekend.  This is Vinny.  He tells me, ah, this is Vinny.  April's the worst.  Ah, who, who?  April's the worst time in a month.  It's just the worst time of the year.  That's why I booked you and didn't put pressure on you.  Aren't you booked famous people, you jackass?  Book me in the good months.  I thought you had a shot.  You have no shot.  Well, I don't.  No, you don't. 
[02:53:30]  That awful racist community you live in.  Yeah, New Brunswick, known for not liking black people.  They don't.  New Brunswick, Newark, Camden, they all hate black people.  They're known for black people being there, but not for liking them.  Well, maybe those two things go hand in hand.  Oh, my God.  Look at Vinny, upset about the fries.  Vinny, don't worry.  Not upset about the fries.  He has delicious fries in the back.  They're a fucking good fries.  Vinny's, I will say, all kidding aside, Vinny's food is good. 
[02:54:00]  And if you don't like it going down, believe me, three hours later, it's great coming up.  How much of my food has been shit under your chest?  Wow!  The funny part of that joke is he thinks I'm a rookie and I waste it on the chest.  What, am I an open microphone for shit?  His chest was two years ago. 
[02:54:30]  PassÃ©.  Oh, shit on the chest is so 98.  Oh, God.  Shit on the chest.  Vinny, you should headline your own club this weekend.  Screw Patrice.  He does quite often.  Yes, he does.  All right.  Maybe it'll snow tonight, Patrice.  You'll get off.  That is the worst, though, when you headline.  Except for this last time I did okay in Baltimore, but every other time I've had 30 people there  on a Saturday.  And you just look at the staff.  What are you talking about?  Like, when you're in a club, if it's empty, which the Baltimore improv for me has been 
[02:55:00]  brutal a couple times.  Well, are you on in Baltimore?  Now we are.  It's okay.  Yeah, that's why they don't show up.  If you're not, anywhere that they don't listen to the radio, who knows you, stupid?  That's what I'm saying.  You're about as unknown as me if it wasn't for Opie and Anthony.  That's not true.  He did Spider-Man.  He was in the movie Spider-Man.  I mean, I couldn't be as unknown as you.  He's six foot eight and invisible.  No one knows me. 
[02:55:30]  How does this happen?  Actually, I think no one knows me unless I did the Opie and Anthony.  I'm unknown.  In the 80s, I'd be somebody.  It's amazing how...  Why do you keep saying in the 80s?  Because hacks in the 80s, I'm saying...  Are you a hack?  Wait, this is people in the business talking.  I've done four movies.  I've been on Conan O'Brien about six times.  You sound like a whiny bitch right now.  You sound terrible. 
[02:56:00]  Just start saying funny shit.  Maybe people will come see you.  I'm trying to sell tickets to your stupid hat club, Vinny.  Have you done six Conan?  You sound like you're begging.  Who's booking that?  Who's booking Conan?  That's the awful comedian interruption.  Who's booking that?  Damn it.  I'm not whining.  I'm just saying.  Now, people know you're selling tickets.  I'm really busting your balls.  It's going to be good.  I know what your stupid hair do.  Just shut up.  Was that doctor a bob or two at the same time?  Root canal and a trim, you jackass.  There's nothing wrong with Vinny's haircut. 
[02:56:30]  If you're on a stage singing,  Put me on the ribs.  There's nothing wrong with that.  You really do have a hat head.  I can't believe I'm watching a fucking dying black man give him dental advice  and you give me hair advice.  What is upside down about this fucking world?  You have no head to speak of.  God almighty.  Before you insult me, can you just pick up a receiver?  It makes no sense.  It says unless you pretend you're a cop. 
[02:57:00]  Hey, Norton, Leobald.  Here's two free tickets.  Y'all ready to laugh?  732-545-4242 for tickets.  Thank you, Jim.  Ha ha.  Stress factor.  Yeah, stress factor.  It's going to be good.  It's going to be very good.  We have a very special...  That sounds convincing, Vinny.  No, let me tell you something.  It's actually...  It's a good show.  Big Jay is also very fucking funny.  Yes, Jay is.  He killed last night.  Jay Oakerson is a very funny dude.  As much as I find him annoying offstage with his awful fat face and smoking habits. 
[02:57:30]  Between Jay and Patrice, this is the fattest show I've ever bought.  This is a fucking really...  I'm really scared of the food bill this night.  I can't eat food at your place no more, Vinny.  It's a wrap.  You can.  No.  You even fry your lettuce.  Lettuce.  Give me a fried Greek cheese and fried Caesar salad.  Vinny dips his Caesar salad in flour. 
[02:58:00]  He's right.  He's right with the saying about my phone.  You're cutting below the belt right there.  Oh, sorry.  Folks, it's a delicious fried Caesar.  He takes pride in his food there, Patrice.  Please.  What'd I miss?  We've just been doing this for an hour.  We gave up on the show, I think, at 8.30.  Anthony's a trooper.  Another hour of Betty Davis mouth over here.  Jesus Christ.  I can't feel a thing. 
[02:58:30]  I know I'm just going to wrench down on my tongue and have to go to the emergency room.  Did he give you some pills for today?  No, I've got to go fill a prescription.  But that'll, that'll, that'll, will that stay right for you until the end of the show, at least?  Uh, yeah, so, let's ask Anthony.  That's all they say.  Thanks, Olson.  What was that thing Mary Poppins said?  Yeah.  Supercalifragilisticexicalidocious.  Maybe I should come back and sit in that chair.  Because you really can't contribute to your ass.  You really can't do shit.  Oh, man. 
[02:59:00]  Where's Bonnie?  Where's Bonnie?  That's Bonnie.  My fiance.  My clever.  That fucking worm Voss.  We were doing Albany together, and that phone rang 30 times, and that cocksucker picked it up every time.  He's, he's, he has changed, Voss has changed, man.  We've seen it, we've seen it.  But he changed, you know what, he changed her.  You know her?  Yeah.  He's changed her too, man.  Really?  She's not, it's not just like Voss is in love, they're both like, in this weird love.  And I think because they're both degenerates, and this is their first time that they've been loving to another human being. 
[02:59:30]  And they just, they're losing their minds.  They're really running with him.  I can't wait till she dumps him.  I can't wait till she's cut over the feet of his feet.  She's got to wait for some more change.  She's got to wait for Voss to make her funny.  He would be heartbroken.  What I can't wait is till they fire him from the show they have together.  They keep her up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And she'll have to go, look, I love you, but I have to think of myself too.  It's for us.  I'll do it for us.  I tell you, I thought it's lasted a long time so far.  I thought it'd be over, but, you know. 
[03:00:00]  No.  I'll be there to pick him up.  Don't worry, Vossy.  All his friends.  I don't know Bonnie that well, but Voss is in love.  He really is in love.  Voss is really in love.  It makes me sick.  But he's 57.  He got his credit just cleared up.  He bought his first house connected to another house.  He bought his first town, I own my townhouse apartment.  It's Simeon's home, fucking zilch.  Get out of here.  Get something with a yard, you're 80. 
[03:00:30]  Jesus Christ, with your rented home that's disguised as ownership, you idiot.  Oh, there's wheels on it, in case I want to move it.  Anybody want to buy my Rolex?  Oh, you jerk off.  Oh, he's all happy he just got credit at 57.  Just got it.  First love and first comfort.  Voss is out of high school.  He's 42 years removed from everything.  He's the only guy that had his children cosign for his townhouse. 
[03:01:00]  Date of birth of Signee, 86.  One, four, 86.  I'm going to ask Bonnie to wear my pin.  Will you marry me?  And he bought her a second-hand wedding ring or a pin.  Not a good deal.  It makes me sick.  Did you hear his awful proposal story?  It was in a Best Western, like near Newark Airport.  They flew it.  Oh, it's fucking...  Joel Steinberg was more romantic, but he was fucking chaining Little Lisa to the thing 
[03:01:30]  and punching her head in the throat.  Did you hear what he said to her?  Did you hear what he handed her to the box and said...  He turned around and walked away and said,  You can say no if you want to.  How fucking sad.  How fucking unbelievably sad.  What a low self-esteem.  You think he was the same size kneeling down, asking to marry his wife?  Little fingers putting the ring on him.  Oh, the awful hands.  She probably jumped twice before she... 
[03:02:00]  Oh, all right, I do.  Just don't touch me no more.  All right, all right.  Yes.  He has awful claymation hands.  They don't bend.  Take doll fingers.  Just leave the ring on the pillow.  I'll grab it.  I can't wait until Bonnie leaves him.  I just can't wait.  All curled up in the shower.  Washing off.  Trying to hold his face with his little Davy and Goliath fingers.  Back to the pipe.  Back to gambling.  Back to booze.  Oh.  I cannot wait until Balls is back.  Put him right over the top.  Oh, sell this house for a... 
[03:02:30]  Sell this house for a hit.  Sell that connected to another house.  Mansion.  Hey, Patrice, I think I found out why people don't like you.  You're not nice.  You're not a fucking nice guy.  Like, you don't have a nice thing going on.  One of my favorite tough crowd moments was awful, Patrice.  Jeff Garland was on the show.  Oh.  And Jeff said some joke that just bombed.  And Patrice was like, you're on a fucking improv show and that's the funniest thing you can say?  And Jeff just broke out and goes, what are you, going to fucking bust my balls? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, I hate that Fred Flintstone head.  He's really buzzing.  Every time I see his smarmy giant head.  Makes me want to try to get candy out of it.  That fat...  He's going to curb your enthusiasm, really?  That makes me laugh about as much as a lamp.  I've never seen it.  I've never seen the show.  By mistake, I think.  Is it overrated?  Nothing much working except for HBO.  Is it overrated?  Oh, whatever, man. 
[03:03:30]  You know, you can't even talk about certain things in your career.  People are like, oh, it's a curb.  Whatever.  That moon head.  I like to shove his head right in the toilet like Mickey Rourke.  Did you get to the, um...  I can't even say it.  Oh, the trainable?  No.  Trainable.  Well, we can do that.  We have to end the week by getting rid of this.  The trainable audio.  And don't play the ones we've heard.  My head hurts.  We've got four that we haven't played yet.  But first, I mean, Patrice O'Neal is going to be playing Vinny's Club this weekend. 
[03:04:00]  Stress Factor.  What's the number again there, Jimmy?  And I like the way Vinny did this because what happens is you incorporate part of the mood  into the phone number, which I thought was just a super idea.  It's 732-545.  Ha, ha.  That's like a hospital going, call us at 1-743-Ow-Ow.  1-800. 
[03:04:30]  That's...  1-4-1-2.  And leave off the last tumor for savings.  5-4-5-4-2-4-2.  But that comes in a ha, ha, ha.  That is absolutely fantastic.  What a coincidence.  Yeah.  I paid extra for that.  Yeah, and he fought hard for that.  We said, well, we got giggle, giggle.  Do you want that one?  No.  No.  It's got to be ha, ha.  Ha, ha. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, you're fucking stupid.  I can waste too many numbers.  Hey, when Keith Robinson works, he said, you have to change to 5-4-5-Z-Z-Z-Z.  Oh, man.  That's another black guy.  Two and a half.  Two and a half.  Two and a half black guys.  Oh, they're doing...  Oh, this...  I love this.  I'm in the stress factor.  I stopped by this and I'm pissing.  And I look on the wall and they have advertisers for shows coming up.  And Vinny and Keith Robinson are doing a Father's Day show. 
[03:05:30]  What's it called?  Father's Day in black and white.  Father's Day in black and white, yeah.  Like one black guy, one white guy.  You know, both dads.  Probably different points of view.  And fucking Keith's credits.  Because this fucking finished idiot.  Hammer it, you fucking moron.  Hammer it.  Next Thursday.  Keith...  I've already sold more seats than you, you cocksucker.  It's a great...  I have a fucking 150 on the book for Thursday.  That's a great show.  Thank you.  But Keith's credits on that fucking wall, I wanted to throw that paper into the urinal.  He said he was on Star Church a couple of years ago.  A couple of years ago? 
[03:06:00]  Did he say a couple?  Yes.  Like Keith is this up and comer.  Keith is 46 years old.  It's the new one on PAX.  That's what he's talking about.  We still have a headshot that says Pudge him on it.  Fucking Keith's first sets now are on the Game Show Network.  He is fucking...  An old Finnish man.  He really is an old man now.  That credit list is awful.  You look at all these impressive credits and then you realize, oh, those are the people  he's open for.  I told you, every time he's on stage, after he finishes a joke, he reintroduces himself. 
[03:06:30]  He's a big MC.  That's brutal.  That's brutal.  Anthony, you all right over there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's just wiggling his tongue around him.  I'm like, it's like stroke face.  And the worst part is, I know it's going to wear off.  And the pain will come back.  How long did he say it would stay?  Two hours.  At least until you get to the other place, right? 
[03:07:00]  You go to the other dentist.  Yeah, but that wears off, too.  I got it.  Yeah, but when there's no nerve, man, if they get the nerve out, you can't feel anything.  It's not going to exist.  The pain is going to be gone.  I think the penicillin's got to kick in.  You get pain medication, though, from the other place.  They'll prescribe something.  You'll be fine, man.  You'll be fine.  Vicodin.  Tell him to take that nerve out, Anthony.  Get it out.  And then you'll be like, out.  Out.  Let's go to Mark.  Yep.  Mark, what's up, buddy?  Not much.  I'm wondering if Jimmy Norton, when you call a hoker, do you call 1-800-HO-HO? 
[03:07:30]  Oof.  I wouldn't have minded.  I wouldn't have minded so much if you didn't call her a hoker, you fucking idiot.  A hoker.  A hoker.  A hoker.  Are you a hoker?  I just thought I was saying, right?  Oh, that poor guy was waiting for hours.  Oh, he was.  I'm going to crack them all up.  They're going to love this.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neil.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really. 
[03:08:00]  You know, when you think about it.  It's M202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  This next bit.  Yeah.  Travis Tritt in studio.  Washington loves this interview.  Really?  They love it so much that I'm telling you right now, I've heard this interview five or six times.  Already.  Five or six times.  Why are we replaying the Travis Tritt interview?  We've never replayed it.  We've never replayed it, Anthony.  That's the answer to this guy.  How did you hear it?  Other channels have it.  Other channels have it.  It's been all over the XM platform because they thought our interviewing skills were just on, oh boy. 
[03:08:30]  Fire?  Fire would be good.  How about that?  On point.  On point would be good.  On the money.  No, there's something else I'm trying to come up with.  Our interviewing skills were...  Impeccable?  Impeccable.  Flawless?  Flawless.  A force to be reckoned with?  A force to be reckoned with.  A force to be reckoned with?  Unrecognizably good?  Sure.  That too.  I didn't mean that.  I meant to say undeniably good.  Oh, undeniably good.  I said unrecognizably. 
[03:09:00]  We pulled this interview out of our back pocket though, man.  I mean...  Of course.  Who thought Travis Tritt was going to be a good guest on this show?  I remember panicking going, Travis Tritt, we don't know much about country, I've heard  the name, and for some reason we all just got along and it was a lot of fun.  I'm annoyed I missed him too.  He's a very famous guy.  That would have been a great photo op.  Oh, of course.  I was away.  Busy, like.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Awful.  Girls Gone Wild, reality TV style. 
[03:09:30]  Just the miles and miles of those girls gone wild.  Freaking hard, using daddy's credit card.  Mama Holla's stopping that child.  Don't you know the girls gone wild.  I like it, Anthony.  I like it a lot.  Travis Tritt, outside the studio, making his way in.  Yeah.  He's playing the House of Blues here in New York City tonight.  House of Blues.  House of Blues, yes. 
[03:10:00]  Here he comes.  Popping on in.  There he is.  There he is.  Travis Tritt, everyone.  How you doing?  Good, good.  How you doing, man?  Doing great, man.  Yeah.  Got stuck in some of the city traffic.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you're in New York.  What can you expect?  That sucks.  That's kind of the deal.  It really does.  It's really not much different than Atlanta, though.  I'm from Atlanta.  Oh, boy.  We got something in common.  You know?  We almost took a radio job down in Atlanta, and they were trying to convince us that Atlanta 
[03:10:30]  is just like New York City.  It really is, brother.  In some respects, I mean...  We didn't see it.  I got a...  They took us to some redneck bars.  Anthony and I, we've seen a lot in our years, and we were kind of scared.  Well, I think they call it like the New York of the South, and believe me, you know, years  ago when I first got into the music industry, you know, everybody kept telling me, you know,  you need to move to Nashville, which at that time, Nashville had no sports teams whatsoever. 
[03:11:00]  They had no good restaurants.  They're still working on that, you know, and they're trying to get that together.  But it was just...  I said, what in the world am I going to do up here, you know?  So I stayed at home, stayed in Atlanta, and at least had decent sports and decent restaurants.  At least you had music, though, in Nashville, you know?  Yeah, well...  Like, if you're going to Nashville, at least you got music.  Which, you know, the surprising thing, Music City, USA, and there's no places to go,  or at least there weren't at that time, to go hear live music...  In Nashville? 
[03:11:30]  Really, anywhere.  It was surprising.  Really surprising.  You would think, you know, the whole image you have in Nashville is every corner, you're  just...  Well, Music City, USA.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's on every sign going into town, and...  We got to tell you, Atlanta has so much crazy stuff going on, too.  Oh, yeah.  It fascinates Anthony and I.  It really does.  We were down there interviewing, just really fast, maybe get your take on this, this whole  freak Nick thing that happens.  Yeah.  Dude, holy crap.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I have to say is, holy crap.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were stuck in traffic, because three cars across the whole highway we were on were 
[03:12:00]  stopped, and people were dancing on the cars.  Yes.  And we're like, oh, boy.  I'm surprised they were just dancing on the cars.  Yeah.  We saw some stuff that might have looked like dancing.  Yeah, exactly.  This is how it was told to us.  It's spring break for black colleges, and they go to Atlanta, and they'll just, yeah, you'll  be on a road, a highway, and they'll just stop in the middle, because they are feeling the  music.  Yeah.  And then they jump up on their cars, and they're dancing and stuff. 
[03:12:30]  They're dancing around, and some of the dancing, it looked like guys were just having  sex with girls.  Well, that's basically, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty much.  This must be a few years back, though, because the fact is...  They've thrown it down?  No, they stopped it.  Wow, did they?  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, and they couldn't actually come in and just say, we're just going to shut it down.  But I think the Georgia State Patrol, sitting on I-75, watching every single car that came  into the state from any outside borders, automatically, if it's loaded up, they're going to pull them 
[03:13:00]  over, and probably somebody's going to jail before they ever even get to Atlanta.  So they sort of discourage people from coming in and doing that deal.  You've got a taillight out, boy.  You've got one of those good old boys.  You in a heap of trouble, boy.  I love that.  And nothing better than that nightstick coming out and cracking that taillight.  Yeah, there's a whole thing going on. 
[03:13:30]  The shopkeepers were boarding up their businesses, and they told us.  They told us flat out, get out.  You've got like two days.  Yes, everybody, I mean, you know, you think about the people that live there, you know?  I mean, people coming through town and coming through their yards at all hours of the night,  you know, and using their shrubbery for restrooms and, you know, I mean, waking up in the morning,  you know, and there's somebody having sex on your porch, you know?  It's just not fun. 
[03:14:00]  Not fun.  Absolutely not, man.  All right.  Well, it's great to be here, guys.  Thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  Thanks for coming.  We really don't get that many big stars coming through here.  We had Ozzy Osbourne came through, which was cool.  Oh, cool, yeah.  Ozzy's quite a character.  He is, man.  Yeah.  And we had Sunset Thomas today at Sunset Thomas.  Sunset Thomas.  We had Porn Star of Sunset Thomas.  Porn Legend.  Man.  Sunset Thomas.  Last time I saw her, now this is a weird story.  Last time I saw her, I was in Las Vegas about a year or so ago, and Carrot Top was doing 
[03:14:30]  a show out there.  Of course he was.  Carrot Top was doing a show, so I've known him for quite a few years, and call him up  and, yeah, you've got to come out to the show tonight, so we'll go see the show.  Afterwards, we go back in the dressing room, and there's this barrage of what looked like  the circus had come to town, you know, of people coming down the hallway, and I start  recognizing someone.  I was like, that looks like, although I wouldn't know really what he looks like, but that looks 
[03:15:00]  like that might be that guy Ron Jeremy right there.  And then, you know, the whole group, Sunset Thomas, I mean the whole bunch, man, they  were back there.  Ron Jeremy, we've had him on the show a lot.  He's a lot of fun.  Oh, what a trip, man.  Must have been the porn convention.  I don't know what was going on.  I think they were just in town to see Carrot Top, which, yeah, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't know what the association is there.  I don't know what that's all about.  Maybe they like Carrot Top's buff body. 
[03:15:30]  I've never seen a guy that spends more time on his body than Carrot Top.  That shouldn't have to.  No doubt.  Like, you're goddamn Carrot Top.  Why do you have to be the strongest man in the world?  How much arm strength do you need to hold up a toilet seat and make a joke about it?  Jesus Christ.  He was sick of people making fun of him.  I guess so, you know.  When you're Carrot Top, you've got to be able to kick some ass, I guess.  No doubt.  That's great.  I was looking through your bio a little bit, and first of all, a couple of things in common  that I have in common, the divorce thing. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I saw that.  But I saw it twice.  Yeah.  And any time I see this, I've got to ask, how did you get suckered into getting married  after one divorce?  Well, you know, I got married the first time when I was just a kid.  I was 18 years old, right out of high school.  I got married more than anything else to get out of the house, you know, and also to prove  my father wrong, who said, this is going to be a mistake, son.  And it's like, well, you know, I'll prove you wrong. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, well.  Guess who was right?  Yeah.  He was.  But I got out of that thing about two years into it, and then it was sort of a, you know,  turn around on the rebound.  And I had just come out of that divorce, and I also had changed the way I made a living.  I was working for a heating and air conditioning company up until that point.  That's the second thing that we have in common.  Yeah.  Did you do that?  Duck work, man.  No kidding?  Really?  That's what I did up until 94. 
[03:17:00]  I'll be darned, man.  Addicts, 200-degree addicts.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Pumping units up there.  There you go.  Duck work.  There you go.  Cutting your hands on clinch collars.  Oh, yeah.  I still got scars, man, all over the place.  Yeah.  Everywhere.  Everywhere.  You just come home with your hands like chopped meat.  It is just thankless work, man.  And that's because you chose not to suck cock.  Well, that's what Son said, Thomas.  And now we've got to explain to Travis.  Son said, Thomas is in.  And she said at one point she's eating ramen noodles and living on a mattress in some room 
[03:17:30]  somewhere.  Yes.  And she was at the crossroads of her life.  Yeah, the crossroads of her life.  And that's when she decided to go into the porn industry.  And Anthony, before that, said, well, I was doing the same thing.  I was eating ramen noodles and living in my car.  But I didn't have the option of, you know, sucking cock.  Thank you, Opie, for this so eloquently.  You know, I had to go and then decide I was going to have to work for a living.  And I got into sucking cock to start sounding like a good idea when you were in some of these 
[03:18:00]  attics.  Jesus Christ.  You know, when you have your dreams and stuff, because everybody does, and I'm sure you had  your dream of becoming a star with music.  I had mine, too.  I was in bands through my whole life, and working your ass off, hump and tin up in these  attics.  That's a fact.  And you just have this, you know that there's got to be something else out there that you  look at your co-workers, a lot of them are cool guys, but you look and go, this guy is  just cut out for this job. 
[03:18:30]  Absolutely, absolutely.  He will never go any farther than this right here.  Right, right.  This is his life.  But, and I don't want to sound like I have this overinflated self-image of my, but there  was always something that said, I am not meant to do this until I get older.  There's like a dream, and you want to do something else.  Mine, I did always want to do radio or do something in music.  Yeah.  And, you know, how did you get the break where you were able to get out of doing that?  Well, you know, after that first marriage ended, I decided, you know what, if I go out 
[03:19:00]  and try this thing now, and if I fall flat on my face, nobody is going to suffer but me.  You know, I'm the only one.  So, I figured, why not?  You know, as they say in Vegas, no balls, no blue chips, you know?  So, it's like, go for it.  Give it all you got.  And I quit my regular job, went and took a gig playing in a club, just doing a solo acoustic  thing, and I think the booking was for like a month, and after that, I didn't know where 
[03:19:30]  the next paycheck was going to come from, you know?  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, you've got to do that.  You've got to go out and give it a shot and try.  If all else fails, you're back in the attic.  There you go.  That's one thing they always said.  Get yourself a trade, just in case.  You know, I understand.  My mother was always saying that.  I appreciate your dream and what you want to do, but get yourself a trade.  It's like, thanks for the vote of confidence, Mom.  Thanks, Mom.  Something to fall back on.  Something to fall back on.  Yeah, that's it.  You ever heard that?  You can do anything you want.  Don't sell your tools.  You can do anything.  Yeah, I still keep WD-40 in my snips. 
[03:20:00]  But I went in and they used to have Marlboro cigarettes used to have a talent contest years ago where they would go around from in all the major cities where they had this big concert tour.  And they had all these different people in the country music world.  I think at the time they had like the Judds and Randy Travis and Ronnie Millsap and different ones that would headline this concert.  And they would do a competition, a talent competition, in each city.  And if you won that talent competition, you got to open for that band or that concert. 
[03:20:30]  And you had to send in a professional tape.  I had no money.  I had no connections to anybody with a professional recording studio.  But I did have a friend of mine who was an electrician.  And he was wiring up a studio, a home studio for a guy.  And he said, listen, he called me one day and said, I think I can probably get you some free studio time as a favor to me.  And it's something how things work out.  I go in and I record this thing. 
[03:21:00]  I just did like three songs that I had written.  And as it turned out, the guy who was having the studio done at his house was a vice president for Warner Brothers Records at the time.  And he'd been working Madonna and Prince Records and Rod Stewart and the Doobie Brothers and ZZ Top and you name it.  And he's got all these golden platinum records hanging on the wall.  And I walked in and he came in about the second song in as I was recording. 
[03:21:30]  And when I got done in the control room, I walked back in the control room and he said, where have you been all my life?  And you said, oh, yeah, one of those guys, he might be in the porn industry.  No, it was one of those situations where, you know, he said, you know, I really think you could could maybe do something and go somewhere.  And we ended up recording a little album in that in that studio over the course of the next year. 
[03:22:00]  And he took it out to to L.A. and played it for the executives at Warner Brothers.  And the rest was sort of history.  Amazing how stuff like that works.  Yeah, man, it's just, you know, one of those.  It's truly a lucky break.  Right place, right time.  Right place, right time.  Did you take care of that guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made a lot of money.  I can imagine.  He made a lot of money.  Who, the electrician?  No.  The guy that hooked you up.  The guy that hooked me up.  Yeah, I took care of him, too. 
[03:22:30]  I took care of him, too.  Yeah, I took care of him, too.  Yeah.  He's putting flex on clinch collars and stonatic right now.  Goddamn Travis Tritt.  He's got my old job.  He brought me this stinking X-Lex watch.  He's supposed to take care of me.  He was going to come on the radio, son of a...  Goddamn, that's something.  We got a call earlier from somebody that said, you don't do the quarter song live?  Oh, yeah.  No, I do. 
[03:23:00]  You do?  You know, I had to threaten not to do it.  And we actually have an announcement now every night before the show.  Actually, Larry the Cable Guy recorded it for me.  And he came out on the road and did several shows with us a few years back.  But it's one of those things.  I was on stage.  When I first started doing Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares, somebody got the bright idea that the thing to do would be to pitch quarters up on the stage.  What is this, Rocky Horror, you freaks? 
[03:23:30]  It was the electrician.  Yeah, it was the electrician trying to beam you.  You know, the weird thing is, is that apparently this is something that's kind of gone on.  I was talking to some of the guys from Leonard Skinner, you know, Gary Rosnan's a good friend of mine.  And he told me that years ago when Skinner had a song called Give Me Back My Bullets, which was basically talking about give me back my bullets on the radio, you know, on the chart.  You know, if you're moving up the chart, that's number five with a bullet.  Well, that's what the song was talking about.  But they basically, they came in and people thought it was talking about live ammunition, which they brought to concerts and then threw up onto the stage. 
[03:24:00]  It was mad, man.  Can you believe that?  And somewhere that same mentality transferred over into this song.  And when it first started out, it was actually kind of cool because we were playing little small clubs and stuff.  You know, it wasn't anything really, really huge.  If you threw from the back of the room, that's probably about 50 feet.  So, you know, that's not a big deal.  But, you know, you start playing big arenas and stuff. 
[03:24:30]  You try to get a quarter from third row balcony to the stage, you've got to hurl that son of a gun, you know.  So, I was on stage one night in Bristol, Tennessee and playing a big arena up there and somebody threw one.  I don't know where it came from, but I got hit just above the left eyebrow and I thought I'd been shot.  I mean, it just literally, it was like one of those things I could picture my head going back. 
[03:25:00]  It looked like JFK in the Zapruder film, you know.  And I immediately, you know, I thought, what in the hell was that?  And I looked down at the front of my guitar and there's just blood just, you know, gushing down the front of my guitar.  Wow.  And so I turned around and I ran back to the drum riser and I grabbed a towel and I put it up on my head.  I thought, well, okay, I'm going to be all right.  This is going to stop any second.  Consummate professional must go on.  I'm thinking I'll walk back up there and start singing, well, you know, you can't stop the blood. 
[03:25:30]  And I walked back up to the microphone and now I'm starting to get dizzy.  It ended up stopping the show.  And for a while I thought, how are we going to deal with this?  You know, this is one of the biggest hits of my career at that point and, you know, at the very beginning.  How am I going to...  I'm like going out in a suit of armor playing this one.  I'm going to wear riot gear, Kevlar, put up the chicken wire like in the Blues Brothers movie.  There you go.  That's it, man. 
[03:26:00]  But we actually, we started, my manager at the time told me, he said, you know, let's try making an announcement,  basically just letting people know that, you know.  Oh, that never works.  Because it's such a huge song.  It's not one of your songs that you could just, ah, we just won't play it anymore.  Yeah.  Like a B-side or something.  Exactly.  It's one of those that people are going to want to hear.  Yeah, so, you know, we basically just put the word out that, okay, look, if that does happen again,  obviously it stops the show.  And, you know, really you people are the ones screwing yourselves because, you know, I've already gotten paid, 
[03:26:30]  so it doesn't make any difference, you know.  But it actually did work, surprisingly enough.  We do a lot of stuff in front of our fans.  Yeah.  And when we have to make these silly announcements.  Different fans.  And the manager of the club or the place we're at is always begging us, no, you have to tell them this.  And as soon as we tell them, it just gets worse.  If we told our audience, people, please keep breathing, they'd all hold their breath until they drop dead. 
[03:27:00]  They really would.  That is the type of audience we have.  That's the difference in audiences.  Just dedicated to the old F you.  Oh, yeah.  You know, they don't care.  I was surprised, actually, that it did work, but I was glad that it did because we've been able to do the song ever since, you know.  Yeah.  But country's a way different audience.  It's people from 8 years old to 80 years old that are in these country shows.  Yeah, but they all have quarters.  When's the last time you saw an 80-year-old woman heave a quarter from a third balcony?  Did you guys collect a lot of money, then?  Wrap it up in our pennies.  That was the cool thing. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  It's the beer money, right?  The band and the crew would go out, you know, and take the money, rake the money up off the stage every night.  Of course.  And buy either, you know, beer for the bus, or they'd buy, like, video games for the bus, or, you know, whatever.  You know, Sunset Thomas videos, you know, whatever it may be.  That kind of thing.  Did you ever go through a point where you were still working for a living, but you heard yourself maybe on the radio, or had you cut clean from the working world?  I had pretty much gotten completely out of it at that point, but it was, I still remember the first time I ever heard myself on the radio, man. 
[03:28:00]  It was just, and to this day, it's still something that, quite frankly, I can tell you everywhere I was, exactly where I was, when I heard any of my singles on the radio the first time.  Really?  Because there's still something new about that, you know?  You know, it's just the greatest feeling in the world to be able to know that that was something, I mean, when I was a kid growing up, you know, listening to the radio, and that was a dream. 
[03:28:30]  That was making it.  Yeah, I never ever thought I would ever be amongst those people, you know?  I never thought I would ever even get a chance to meet half of these people, and much less get played on the radio.  So, for me, it's kind of like, I feel like I won the lottery every day, you know?  I'm a lucky guy, and it all goes back to that first time, man.  I remember, you know, the band and I, we were going up to do a showcase in Nashville.  We had all packed into this, into, like, two rental vans that we had, panel trucks that we had rented, and we were driving back from Nashville, and we just about had lost the radio station there, just about completely faded out. 
[03:29:00]  But they came on and said, coming up next, that new single from new country artist Travis Tritt, and we pulled the vans over on the side of the road, on the side of the interstate, and sat there and waited for them to play the song.  And it was just like, this is as good as it gets, you know?  That's it.  You're on the road. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  You're playing music.  It's on the radio.  That's it.  Were you humping your own gear at the time, too?  Oh, yeah, man.  Doing everything.  You know, it's funny, because when we hire people now, you know, and regardless of whatever job it is in my organization, I tell them, I say, you know, there's not a single thing that you guys, that I'm going to hire you guys to do or expect you to do, that I haven't done physically at some point.  Rig your own lighting and everything.  Oh, yeah, man.  Run your own soundboard.  Rig your own lighting.  Shlep your equipment in and out of the place, you know?  There's a greater appreciation for what the other guys are doing now.  Absolutely, man.  Absolutely.  You don't treat them like shit when you've done it yourself. 
[03:30:00]  Ant's got a similar story about hearing himself on the radio the first time.  Yeah.  Because you guys do have a lot in common.  I'm noticing you.  I always loved radio.  I did a lot of song parodies with my band that I had years ago, and they'd be played on the radio.  And I used to go on Opie's show.  He was on BAB out on Long Island.  And the morning guy.  Yeah, we started working together, but I couldn't get him, you know, a board yet.  So he was like, kind of.  So I was still up in the attic.  Doing the attic.  And I'm not content and stuff.  Right. 
[03:30:30]  So for some reason, the morning show guy would take Opie's show, like funny parts of Opie's show, and play him on his show.  Really?  Like give him some time.  You know, notorious radio guys.  They're all a bunch of pricks.  Whatever they could get that'll burn another five minutes.  And he would never say where he came from.  Never give credit for it or anything.  Oh.  So this was like one of my song parodies, and I hear it kick up in the morning.  I'm under something, you know, just probably tarring of this fixture that's going through a rooftop. 
[03:31:00]  You know?  And it's just, I'm in hell.  And I hear myself on the radio.  And I'm like, this is pretty cool.  No recognition.  No name that it was me.  Nothing.  Oh, man.  He just comes on.  All right, we'll be back after this.  Go to the commercial.  Oh, my God.  I'm sitting there, cut up, covered with tar, just sitting there going, with a tear in his eye.  I'm like, why isn't this as cool as I imagined it would have been?  Thank God things, from that point on, got a little better. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, thank goodness.  A little different than Travis's story.  You get a kick in the ass every so often.  I think it just gives you a better character.  Well, you know, I think that's how we, I think we become better people.  Better performers, yeah.  People that are handed the whole thing on a silver platter, or they're just, they're  a created personality.  They're bound for failure.  It's going to be very short-lived, and they're not going to be able to handle it well.  That's exactly right.  They're not going to work with their people well.  You can't be treating the people like crap.  You can't, you know, be a prima donna all the time. 
[03:32:00]  You know, sometimes these sons of bitches have to...  You've got to keep them in line.  Not about the evidence.  You get carried away like a Mr. Humble here.  You know, it just makes it better, it makes it easier to work with people.  Yeah, I think, you know, there's so many people...  But you've worked for a living.  In this industry especially, there's so many people that the only thing they know is they  want to go to Nashville or wherever, they want to go to Los Angeles, they want to go 
[03:32:30]  to New York, and they want to be a star.  Right.  And that's just pretty much as far as the dream goes, and it's not really well thought  out, and it's not...  They don't know anything beyond that.  And I think that's where a lot of people, you know, you get, especially in our industry,  you get a lot of people that come in, and you have people at record labels or whatever  in all their infinite wisdom that try to basically say, you know, you need to do this, you need  to dress like this, you need to sing like this, you only need to do these type of songs,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And so many of these people sort of go along with that because they don't really know any 
[03:33:00]  better.  Well, also, it must be rough, though, early on in your career when you really are close  to that making a point, and you're like, I might not want to screw this up by telling  this guy no, you know?  Did you have to deal with it?  I did.  When I first started out, you know, I had the long hair, you know, my hair was down,  I looked like Greg Allman, you know, it was a long hair thing, and all the rest of the  guys, I came out in 1989 with Garth Brooks, Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, you 
[03:33:30]  know, all these guys, clean-cut guys, wearing the pressed jeans, looked like, you know, come  out of a, you know, cowboy catalog, you know?  And me, I looked like, you know, something out of a biker bar.  I had long hair, wore black leather, completely different than any of those guys.  And I had a lot of grief from a lot of record executives and stuff that said, you know,  we need to do this, we need to cut your hair, we need to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I resisted it for a long time, but at the same time, you know, you're young, you're 
[03:34:00]  new, and you don't want to rock the boat too much.  You're kind of glad you finally got an in.  Right.  You don't want to screw it up.  So I sort of went along with it.  I went in and got a haircut, did that whole program.  I think you're going to be back in that attic going, what did I do?  Oh, my God, man.  What did I do?  I was so ashamed of myself because I compromised, you know, at that point.  And after the first album hit and we had, you know, we had success and, you know, we 
[03:34:30]  had like platinum albums happening and that sort of thing, then you can come back in and  say, okay, now I'm going to start calling some shots.  Yeah, here's the way it's going to go.  You know, and that's sort of been where I've come from.  I'd make him cut his hair.  I would have, but he was bald.  Did you ever meet any of these legends that were probably heroes of yours? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, God, man.  You know, I've been so lucky.  I've had a chance not only to meet them, but I've had a chance to work with them.  Well, now you're like, you're one of their peers.  So, and you probably think, you know, these guys are the legends.  Oh, yeah.  But now you're looked at as one of their peers.  That must freak you out.  It's really, you know, I pinch myself, man, because the fact is, is that, you know,  you know, growing up, you know, guys like Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson,  Hank Williams, Jr., Merle Haggard, George Jones, Ray Charles, huge, huge fans of all these 
[03:35:30]  guys.  And I've had a chance to work with, meet, record with, do movies with, all of these guys.  Yeah.  And it was just, you know, it's like a dream come true.  The last one was Ray Charles.  I, I, for years, I wanted to work with Ray because more than anybody else, I thought  he really affected the way that I sing. 
[03:36:00]  What comes out of my mouth when I sing was more influenced by Ray Charles than by anybody.  And I always wanted to work with him and, and came like this close, you know, numerous  times.  And for whatever reason, at the last second, our schedules would screw things up and it just  never happened.  Um, we finally, about, uh, almost three years ago now, got an opportunity to, uh, to work  together to do a, uh, a special together for, uh, for country music television.  And, um, I went out to his studio in Los Angeles and the two of us just really hit it off. 
[03:36:30]  We came back in, we did this, uh, one hour concert work together.  And then, uh, the, the really cool thing was after it was all over with, you know, I, I was  just, uh, I was really happy that everything had happened the way that it did.  And, uh, and I'm getting ready to leave.  And, uh, his, uh, one of his tour managers came up to me and said, listen, Ray wants to  see you back in the dressing room.  And I go back in the, in the dressing room and he says, listen, he said, I'm going to  give you all my phone numbers. 
[03:37:00]  He said, I want you to call me.  And I said, well, that's very nice.  I appreciate it.  And he said, no, no, no, you don't understand.  He said, I'm not the kind of guy that says, call me.  And then says, you know, I hope he doesn't, you know, I want you to really call me.  And so we did, we, we became really good friends.  We stayed in touch.  We called each other, you know, and talked to each other, uh, at least a couple of times  a month.  He would fly out to, uh, shows from time to time to see me play.  And, you know, it was just a great thing.  I mean, you know, I, I said I could die tomorrow.  Happy guy. 
[03:37:30]  You know, I got to work with everybody I ever wanted to.  What'd you think of the, uh, the movie?  Oh man, I thought it was fabulous.  The first time I saw it, as a matter of fact, we were doing a,  a, uh, a concert for, uh, uh, a foundation that, uh, Ray had started to, um, to raise  money for, uh, Morehouse College down in Atlanta.  And, uh, Bill Cosby hosted this thing in LA and I got to be a part of that.  And, uh, we were one of the first to see the film.  And I said, right off the bat, I said, if Jamie Foxx doesn't win an Oscar for this,  something's wrong. 
[03:38:00]  And of course he did.  I was really, really thrilled.  He, he got the whole essence of Ray down, everything.  Yeah.  It was perfect.  At the expense of his sanity from the, uh, acceptance speeches I've seen him have.  Jamie Foxx, great job, but you're insane.  Talks to his grandmother at night.  I don't know the half of it.  They yelled, cut.  Step out of the carriage.  Step out of the carriage.  He's kind of a crazy person.  Hey, the phone's a jam.  We should get a few people on the line with Travis Tritt here before we get out of here. 
[03:38:30]  Uh, Bubba, make it fast.  You're on with Travis Tritt.  I just wanted to ask how it was playing with, uh, B.B. King and all of them and the Blues  Brothers Keep Out.  Oh, that was really cool.  You know what?  I, uh, I, uh, I got to do that thing.  We went up to Canada a few years ago and, uh, and shot that film and, uh, getting to be  on stage with, you know, people like Eric Clapton and, uh, and, uh, you know, just all  the greats that were in that film, man.  It was, it was like a who's who of, uh.  Can you imagine playing with Eric Clapton? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  You're sitting, you're on stage going, oh God, don't look at me, don't look at me.  I was, I was, I was standing over, you know, in the guitar section of this big band for  the Blues Brothers 2000 movie and, which I thought the best part of that movie was the  music, you know, the script I think was a little lacking, but the, the guitar section,  I'm, I'm standing between, uh, Jimmy Vaughn and Eric Clapton and, you know, I mean, we've  got Billy Preston behind us playing keyboards and B.B.  Kings over here and, um, Bo Diddley and, God, just a, and, uh, and Yoko Ono. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, God, no, please.  Yoko didn't, thank God Yoko didn't ruin that moment.  Thank God.  Thank God.  We started the show with this whole thing with Yoko, so.  Oh, yeah.  Just bring it all back around.  What movie is that from?  Uh, Rock and Roll Circus.  You ever see that with the Rolling Stones?  No, I missed that one.  And for some reason, yeah, Clapton's playing, the Stones, they're all on stage together, the  drum from, uh, Jimi Hendrix Experience.  Jean-Luc, uh, uh, help us here.  Fiddle guy. 
[03:40:00]  Fiddle guy, yeah.  Jean-Luc Ponte.  Ponte, the violin.  He's playing.  And, you know, it's just a moment in history.  Yeah.  A nice jam.  Yeah, a nice jam going.  And Yoko pops up to the mic and just starts caterwauling into this thing.  Oh, no.  And it's ruining the moment in life.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  So, thank God, uh, it ruined that moment.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's frightening.  It's like a woman taking off her clothes and, oh, my God, it's a penis.  If you missed it, the replay's going to start soon. 
[03:40:30]  You can hear what we were talking about.  But first, uh, let's go to Art in Florida.  Art.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Travis.  Hey, Art.  What's happening, brother?  No, I want to hear about the outlaw days.  Like you said, after the, you grew your hair back, weren't you and Alan Jackson fixing to  have a fight?  No, man.  Where'd you get that?  I don't know.  Something back when I was younger, I remember, I thought you and Alan Jackson were going at it  back then or something.  No.  You were outlaw days.  No, never, never.  Alan and I never had any problems whatsoever.  No big east of the Mississippi, west of the Mississippi battle? 
[03:41:00]  No.  You know?  You might.  Oh, okay.  You might.  Sorry for the.  Oops, sorry.  Go ahead.  You might be thinking about, uh, about the Billy Ray Cyrus controversy.  That's what you're thinking about.  After Billy Ray Cyrus came out with that big, huge record, which was, you know, being played  everywhere, uh, ad nauseum, uh, achy, breaky heart, you know, and I, I came out and basically  said at the time that I didn't care for the song and boy, you know, someone had to say  it, you know, I, I was, I was working in rock radio and they made us play it. 
[03:41:30]  Really?  Thinking this was going to be that, uh, yeah.  The crossover.  The big crossover thing.  It was awful.  It was just one of those things where it just, it, it, it, it, it struck me right off  the bat as being exactly what it was, which was kind of a novelty record and, and, you  know, God forbid somebody come out and say that at the time, you know, but I, I did and  I said it unfortunately right at the time when it was, you know, at its hottest point.  So, um, the press took that and ran with it and, um, you know, but I, I've always been 
[03:42:00]  the kind of person and, you know, I say what I think and, you know, let the chips fall  where they may.  That's it.  Travis Tritt, thank you so much.  My pleasure, guys.  That was a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Thank you.  Hey everybody, this is Travis Tritt and you're listening to the worst, and I do mean the worst,  of Opie and Anthony.
