<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with a "Club Soda Kenny" hosted "In Memoriam" segment focusing on a recurring bit where the hosts, along with Troy Kwan and several callers, hilariously misinterpret the meanings of country song titles like "Alyssa Lies" (initially mistaken for infidelity but revealed to be about child abuse and death), "Settling," "Stand," "Wasted," "Anyway," and "Stupid Boy." This segment was rife with explicit language, misogynistic, racist, and ableist slurs, and dark humor.  Comedians Greg Giraldo and Bob Kelly were interviewed, discussing their experiences with relationships and marriage, including infidelity and marital difficulties, with Giraldo offering his characteristically dark humor.

The show continued with a comedian recounting a complex relationship where his infidelity was surprisingly tolerated, leading to a discussion about love versus lust and the role of compatibility in relationships.  This segued into a segment featuring the recurring character "Tippy Tom," known for his unpleasant odor.  Tippy Tom engaged in antics involving a walk through the studio audience and an on-air "prostate exam" by Dr. Steve.  Porn star Brie Olsen briefly appeared, and the hosts played a song from Steve C.'s former band, Foundry.

A lengthy discussion ensued about Steve Carr and Foundry, focusing on the band's awful, clich√©-ridden lyrics (including "I want to punch a girl in her vagina") from their CD "Pendulum" and Carr's questionable stage attire from "Elaine Bryant, the fat woman shop." The hosts relentlessly mocked Carr's weight, musical abilities, and lyrics, punctuated by listener calls with varying reactions to the music. George Carlin joined the show, discussing his radio career, the state of modern media, political correctness, and social commentary, sharing anecdotes and opinions on censorship and societal decay.

The show then shifted to several loosely connected conversations. The hosts expressed their dislike for certain Baby Boomers, commented on a Dennis Hopper retirement commercial, and discussed their perception of America's image abroad, blaming reality TV and the post-Cold War lack of a clear external enemy.  They also shared a pessimistic view of the future concerning the Muslim population's growth.  George Carlin's son was a studio guest, discussing his career choices, including a short-lived TV show and his preference for writing.  Tippy Tom recounted a supposed encounter with Barry Manilow, sparking humorous banter about their sexualities.  A significant portion focused on Steve C. wearing women's capri pants to work, leading to extensive ridicule from the hosts and Sirius XM staff, including a segment from another show's hosts (ALQ), using highly offensive and sexually charged language. Steve C. defended his choice, revealing they were expensive designer pants bought by his girlfriend.  The show concluded with a discussion about the supposed death of recurring caller "Bobo," fueled by a false MSNBC report, and a subsequent fake Bobo voicemail, leading to further comedic speculation.

A "Bobo tribute" segment followed the supposed death, focusing on a prank where Bobo was stood up for hours waiting for a Giants game ride.  Multiple callers claimed to be Bobo, resulting in chaotic impersonations and attempts to verify their identities using details from past calls (borough, mother's name, dog's names).  One caller's long pause before answering the dog's name led to his dismissal as a fraud.  The segment also discussed Bobo's supposed boyfriend, Kurt Love, included Dick Clark audio, and culminated in a rambling, nonsensical video message from Bobo (supposedly proving he was alive), which had a low like-to-dislike ratio, prompting disbelief, amusement, and frustration from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Channel presents  I will remember you  A tribute to the friends we've loved and lost through the years  Will you remember me?  Here to tenderly guide you through their most unforgettable moments on the show is your host, Club Soda Kenny.  In Memoriam, an Opie and Anthony special starts now.  Hello, my name is Club Soda Kenny, and I'm hosting the In Memoriam, Opie and Anthony special. 
[00:00:30]  We look back and remember the friends of the show that are no longer with us.  But I'm here with my producer, Troy Kwan.  How you doing, Troy?  I'm okay.  Good.  Troy, what does Memorial Day mean to you?  A day off from work.  But Troy, Memorial Day is a United States federal holiday, which occurs every year on the final Monday of May. 
[00:01:00]  Let's begin.  Patrice O'Neill.  Once again, we review the top 10 country songs at the time with Patrice O'Neill.  The guys dissect what the songs are about solely based on their titles.  This is the fourth and final time we did this bit with Patrice. 
[00:01:30]  All right, we got country songs in front of us.  It's an interesting bit we do because we don't know shit about country music.  And I think the truckers and, I don't know, some of the country fans out there, they enjoy this bit because we're just clueless.  Well, they can relate.  Because they like it.  And they know what the songs are about.  And we don't.  Yeah, they know these songs like the back of their hand.  I mean, they should be proud of that.  But I'm looking at this list, and I'm trying to be honest with everybody. 
[00:02:00]  There's not one of these songs I've heard.  Nope.  Every once in a while, I'll hear a country song.  I don't know any of these.  So we go through the top 10 country songs.  We give the title of the song.  And then we try to guess what the song is about.  What the song's about.  Because country songs always have a story.  And it's very obvious.  Because the story, maybe not the title, and what it means, like what the story's about, what this game is all about,  is us trying to guess what the story's about just based on the title. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  But the song itself usually has a very obvious story as opposed to some abstract kind of rock song or something  where you can't really guess what it's about.  It's black and white there.  Well, no, it's all white.  It's all white, right?  It's all white.  We want to do this with the top rap songs.  And Patrice made a good point earlier that it's just way too obvious when you can't do it with rap songs.  What was your example again?  I'm going to fuck your bitch in the mouth.  Yeah, it's like, well, I think that's a song.  I think it's some double entendre going on here. 
[00:03:00]  Yes, the mouth is a metaphor for society.  And the dick would be...  Ain't no innuendo.  The song is, I'm going to fuck your bitch.  Nigga, if you walk up on me, I'm going to tell you something.  I'm going to fuck your bitch in the mouth and I'm going to shoot you in your face.  And that's about...  First song.  We don't have to do all of these because some of them, who gives a shit?  In 10th place, Jason Michael Carroll, a song called Alyssa Lies. 
[00:03:30]  Easy.  It's about Alyssa.  And she lies.  And she lies.  She told me she'd love me.  I gave up my goofy redneck shit.  I gave up my horse, Calvin.  Calvin, the bitch was allergic to horses, so I gave up Calvin the horse.  I traded in my really good...  What's some other redneck shit?  I traded in my really good trailer for this shitty little car she wanted to drive. 
[00:04:00]  And then, you know what?  Alyssa fucked my neighbor.  This bitch lie.  It's a this bitch song.  This funky bitch lie.  This fucking bitch, you think?  This fucking bitch song.  Now, do you think it's him?  Because I'm agreeing with you.  It's pretty obvious Alyssa lies.  Yeah.  She's definitely doing some lying.  Yeah, she's lying.  I don't think it means she lies down or something.  No.  Maybe...  But maybe...  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Can I have a second guess?  Uh-huh.  A redo or a second guess?  Go redo. 
[00:04:30]  This is stretching it.  Yeah.  It could be...  I think Alyssa's a guy.  Oh, she really lies.  It's very...  It's a very redneck-y...  You gotta stay redneck-y.  Yeah, you gotta get in a redneck mindset.  All right.  Now.  Okay.  All right, now.  Hey, hey, Jim.  I met this girl.  Her name's Alyssa.  Yeah.  Alyssa.  Alyssa.  Alyssa McGillicuddy up the street.  Dude, this is gonna be my fucking answer, you bastard. 
[00:05:00]  All right, go ahead, Mitchell.  I swear.  Finish it up.  Go ahead.  That is Buddy.  He's telling his buddy.  Be careful.  Watch it, because Alyssa lied.  That was gonna be my fucking answer.  That is very...  That is way out there.  Yeah, it is.  I thought it was a little out there, too, but I'm like...  It is possible.  I think it could be he's talking to a buddy.  We might be giving her too much credit.  Yeah, yeah.  But hey, man, be careful, because that's what I heard.  Don't fall for this bitch.  Alyssa lies.  All right.  But, uh...  Well, she's gonna tell you that she blah, blah, blah, but remember this fucking cunt lies. 
[00:05:30]  But that's not redneck-y.  I don't know, Dan.  All right, let's find out.  Like telling your buddy?  What are you guessing?  I just went for the goof guess.  I went for She's a Guy.  She's a Guy?  Just to keep it goofy.  I don't know.  I asked for a Snapple, and the bitch had an Adam's Ample.  I don't know.  That's fucking Alyssa lies.  All right, here we go.  Alyssa lies.  He's really Jeff.  Jason Michael Carroll. 
[00:06:00]  I met a girl, met a new friend.  New girl, new friend.  Just the other day.  On the playground at school.  What?  Between the tires and the swing.  But she came home with tear-filled eyes.  And she said to me, Daddy, Alyssa, what the fuck is this about?  About what?  Well, I just brushed it off at first.  Cause I didn't know how much my little... 
[00:06:30]  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  What?  Hold on.  What?  Without knowing any more than this...  Daughter in school.  Daughters in school.  She comes home crying, saying, Alyssa lies.  That mommy and daddy aren't together anymore.  Maybe.  What?  And the kid at school knows through the parents.  And she told Alyssa...  She told the daughter that, hey, mommy and daddy aren't together anymore.  Your mommy and daddy are divorced.  And she said, no, Alyssa lies. 
[00:07:00]  And now he's got to tell her, no, we're not together anymore.  These crackers are getting complicated.  Fucking, what the fuck?  Holy shit.  Actually, Alyssa's telling the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be like...  I guess I got to tell you now.  No.  Your daddy's a queer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see what this...  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, I just brushed it off at first.  Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt.  Or the things she had seen. 
[00:07:30]  I wasn't ready when I said you could tell me.  And she said...  Alyssa lies to the classroom.  Alyssa lies every day in school.  Alyssa lies to the teacher. 
[00:08:00]  What?  If you're looking at instant feedback, I'm going to fucking...  You bastard.  Child abuse.  No, I'm serious.  No, it is child abuse.  Yeah.  It's child abuse.  He just said trying to cover every bruise, but what is she lying about?  Alyssa's coming to school with a lot of bruises, and she's making a lot of excuses.  And she's lying because she's getting beat up all the time.  Oh, this is way...  What is this shit?  How the fuck are we supposed to guess that?  What are rednecks doing trying to elevate? 
[00:08:30]  What happened to honky-tonk, badonky-donk?  What happened to...  All right, hold on.  An achy-breaky heart, you motherfuckers.  Enough of you trying to...  This is My Name is Luca, country version.  Someone is...  Ah, Krista in Jersey, what's up?  The song's about child abuse, and she actually died, so it's like she lies with Jesus.  Wait, what...  No.  No, listen to the whole song.  That's it.  At the end, is she dead?  She dies, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  All right, she dies of the child abuse, but now Alyssa lies with Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  Alyssa lies dead.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah.  Go to the end of this fucking song.  Enough of you.  I gotta hear this piece of shit.  All right, now we gotta hear more.  All right, go ahead.  What happened to fucking...  Spin your partner round and round, you fucking crackers?  What the hell's going on?  Enough of this.  So everyone wants to know where Alyssa is, and she's dead, and...  She lies.  Her daughter's asking questions, and now the father's gotta say, look.  So it's not even... 
[00:09:30]  She lies with Jesus.  It's quadruple entendre.  It's like Alyssa...  We have the lyrics?  That makes it a lot easier.  This guy must have made it all the way to the sixth grade.  Johnny Stairs.  What do you mean, with his eyes, or he fell down the stairs, or...  Yeah, what the fuck?  Oh, jeez.  I'm Jason Michael Carroll.  I write a very sensitive song.  I forgot we have to have the Schwarzenegger.  Alyssa lies.  It makes sense now.  I don't even know why, but...  Oh, my God. 
[00:10:00]  You got it?  He's making it very difficult.  All right, let's hear the end of this a little bit.  Because Alyssa lies to the classroom.  Alyssa lies every day at school.  Alyssa lies to the teachers as she tries to cover her bruise.  I had the worst night of sleep in years as I tried to think of a way to calm her fears.  I knew just what it was I had to do, but when we got to school on Monday, I heard the news.  Oh, no.  Let's hear it.  Wait, wait.  We got it queued up.  All right, go.  My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad. 
[00:10:30]  The lump in my throat grew bigger with every question that she asked.  Until I felt the tears run down my face.  And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today.  Oh, no.  Why not?  Why not?  Tell me, please.  She doesn't lie in the classroom. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-uh.  She doesn't lie anymore at school.  Oh, boy.  Where's your life?  Alyssa lies with Jesus.  Because there's nothing anyone to do.  Tears fill my eyes.  When my little girl asks me why... 
[00:11:30]  What the fuck?  What a morbid song.  What the hell's going on with country music?  What the fuck is going on?  Stop whining.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  He beats me up and kills me.  Oh, my God.  This is the new rap.  Yeah.  These guys are more pain than rappers now.  We got nine to go, so let's move on.  Killing children.  Enough with Alyssa lies.  How about...  We're going to have to do all of these. 
[00:12:00]  Well, yes, we...  Now we have to investigate because he made country music step up a notch now.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go with Sugar Land in ninth place.  Top country songs in America.  These are songs we've never heard before.  Settling.  Settling.  What's that about?  Settling.  That is about a junkie.  And the cocaine settled in his system.  You are really...  He couldn't shit it out.  Who knows?  Who knows anyone?  Now we're all flustered.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, you know what?  I am not going to say that all rednecks are like this. 
[00:12:30]  This guy is sick of settling.  They bluffed us.  It's all about what am I fucking doing?  My job sucks.  My whole life sucks.  I'm sick of settling.  Nope.  I'm moving on.  Yes, but...  I'm going to Kansas City.  The only difference I have is this.  He's not talking about him.  Because remember, the whole world's getting fagged up.  He's talking about...  He's telling the story of this group.  Because I think the lead singer is a girl. 
[00:13:00]  It's the story of a woman who's settling for a guy.  No guy would ever go, I'm tired of settling for these funky bitches.  Only women are allowed to say, I'm settling for a guy.  So she's sick of settling.  She's sick of...  That's the only difference I have with you.  All right.  Let's move on.  You got anything?  Settling...  Settling...  Settling down.  Yeah, that's it.  He's just settling down.  Settling down.  We found the right girl.  There it is.  Sugar Land.  Settling.  Settling.  It's like... 
[00:13:30]  Upbeat.  Is this emo?  Shut up.  15 minutes left to throw me together  For Mr. Right Now, not Mr. Forrest  Don't know why I even try  When I know how it ends 
[00:14:00]  Looking like a novel  Maybe we could be friends  I've been leaving it up to fail  It's my life  So it's mine  So maybe I ain't settling  Just getting by  That's enough so-so  For the rest of my life  That's an easy one.  She ain't settling for it.  She ain't settling.  Yeah.  That's a whatever one.  She's just a whore  But she ain't settling. 
[00:14:30]  I ain't settling for anything  Less than everything.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Good luck to you.  Jesus.  That was a little burst of evil for me.  She puts the cunt in country.  That old gag.  All right.  Let's move on.  The eighth top country song in America  Is Rascal Flatts  A song called Stand.  Is it worth it?  Ugh.  I don't know what you want.  I don't want to look.  Nah.  Stand is whatever, right? 
[00:15:00]  Let's just move on to the next one  Because we got a lot of them  Carrie Underwood  Yeah, it's generic.  It's generic?  All right.  Wasted?  Yeah, Carrie Underwood wasted.  It can't be about drugs or alcohol.  Nah, she's too goody two-shoes.  She's like too goody two-shoes.  I know that much.  So I'm going to say wasted  On life and positivity  And how well her life is going.  I know.  I'm thinking she wasted time  Or someone's wasted their life or time  In some way, shape, or form.  I agree with that.  Yeah.  It's definitely a story of someone who wasted 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, wasted.  Because she's very Jesus-y  Yeah.  And this is somebody who didn't  Is not into Jesus  Yeah.  And they're just wasted  They're wasting their time  Wasted their talent  Wasted their  Wasted their life  Whatever it is.  She has to have a follow-up  That's a little more positive  Because she had that  Jesus take the wheel  We talked about  So  She's just  High on life  She's wasted, man  Just wasted on love  Yeah, she's just  Well, you know something?  Who are we to say yes or no  With these fucking country people?  You never know  So let's go to  Maybe it's about Alyssa's father 
[00:16:00]  I tell you  She gets wasted  And beats Alyssa  Alyssa Lies really took me  Jesus, that threw me for a loop  Yeah, no shit, man  This was supposed to be a fun bit  I want to play that one for Sal  Watch him cry  Like the Christmas shoes, Ro  Did you hear Alyssa Lies, Ro?  It's so sad  I was crying  Like the Christmas shoes  Let's get into  Carrie Underwood  Wasted  Hit it 
[00:16:30]  Oh, boy  Not good  Not a happy guitar lick there  Sounds a little  Dark  And the fiddle comes in  Ladies and gentlemen  Carrie Underwood  On Country 105  Standing at the back door  She tried to make it fast 
[00:17:00]  One tear hit the hardwood  It fell like broken glass  She said sometimes love slips away  And you just can't get it back  Let's face it  Yeah  For one split second  She almost turned around  But that would be like pouring raindrops  Back into a cloud  Back into a cloud  So she took another step  Said I see the way out 
[00:17:30]  And I'm gonna take it  Another abusive guy thing  I don't want to spend my life jaded  Waiting  To wake up one day  And find  That a lot of his years go by  Wasted  Yeah, there you go  Another glass of whiskey  She didn't write that  But it still don't kill the pain 
[00:18:00]  So he stumbles to the sink  And pours it down the drain  He said it's time to be a man  And stop living for yesterday  Oh, it's a bunch of little stories  A bunch of little stories  About courage  See, the first one's the bitch  And she's maybe in a bad relationship  So she don't want to waste it  So she walks out the door  And then this is a guy  And he's a drunk  And he fucking pours a whiskey 
[00:18:30]  Down the drain  Well, she's in love with the guy  But he's a drunk  I don't know  Does the story relate?  I think it's just individual stories  Really?  She's 21  Yeah, what does she know?  Why is she singing about that?  It's metaphoric  He's an alcoholic  And she doesn't want to spend her time  Wasting time with this guy  Because it's going nowhere  Because his drinking  No, but he gave up the drinking  He gave up the drinking  Now the next verse  Will be about someone else  She's not buying into it  The next verse 
[00:19:00]  Will be about someone else  I bet  It was just symbolic  But he's not really giving up drinking  His drinking  Has affected the relationship  He has finally realized that  And now he's going to try 
[00:19:30]  To not drink anymore  Because he saw the effect  That he had on her  She was leaving  For the last time  I want to tell you  To be honest with you  Country people  They have a high attention span  They don't have the ADD  Because  Unlike pop  And some rap  Right?

[00:27:00]  That's why  It's been so good  Because you  You would think  It would be  The obvious answer  Boy  Maybe he wouldn't  Call himself a boy  But here we go  Let's listen  Get a little feel  More sadness  Yeah  Of course  It's country  Oh my goodness  Fucking people  White people  She was precious  Like a flower  Yeah  Yeah  Right  She grew wild  Wild  But innocent 
[00:27:30]  Yeah  Perfect prayer  In a desperate hour  She was everything  Beautiful  And different  Stupid boy  You can't fence that in  Stupid boy  It's like holding back  The wind  She let her heart 
[00:28:00]  So ride in your hands  And you stole her  Every dream  And you crushed her plan  That's  I mean  That's in the same  She kind of ditched her  She had a choice  And that's what happens  When the only voice she hears  Is telling her  She can't  Stupid boy  Isn't this what I said?  Well yeah  The second  The chorus explains it 
[00:28:30]  I only read the first part  Jesus  The first part  Wait  I want to defend myself though  The first part  It's very close to what you're saying  It makes it sound like  She's unattainable  Like you're stupid for thinking  That this unbelievable girl  Would be with a guy like you  Ah  And then  Then the chorus pretty much  Makes it  That you're right  I thought  When I heard the opening there  I thought  He was stupid  Because this girl really  Likes him  And he's like 
[00:29:00]  You know  Not giving her the time of day  And he realizes  What he missed out on  Which would have been  You know  Close but different  From what I said  It was like  It was all in the same avenue  You know what I'm saying  Shit  I'm so glad  I'm not a fan of this shit  So if I ever meet Keith Urban  Like I don't know him enough  To not ever have to say  Anything nice to him  Like if I met him  Yeah  And it's like  Wow you're Keith Urban  You know  I listen to a lot  Your shit stinks  Like I don't have to like Keith Urban  It's like I might meet him somewhere  Bumping to him  And it's like  I just  Hey stupid boy

[00:31:00]  And he's kind of  Waiting and watching  And seeing what happens  So he can grab her up  You're not looking  At the spelling  Alright  He's looking through a window  And he's jerking off  To a Chinese girl  Yeah that was my first choice  And I should have  Stuck with that  Well I'm watching you  I'm watching you  I'm watching  I'm watching you  I'm watching Johnny Yu  And I'm being my dick  This song is for Bill Murray  In Caddyshack  He's watching  Watching you  Actually it's  He talks about  Looking through

[00:32:00]  So he's kind of watching  Over her  Watching her  He's got her back  And waiting  No fucking way  It's as simple as what he said  He's watching  He is watching a chick  These low self esteem  Country music guys  Are all  He's watching a girl  That he likes  And he just can't find  He can't make the move  And he wishes he could  Can't make the move  There's no way  But the song's gonna end  With a little hope  Oh good  Maybe she smiles at the end  She dies  All right  Any other answers coming in  Yeah that's about it  And the end of the song  He's gonna be

[00:40:00]  Who died  While serving  In the United States Armed Forces  Next  We have Greg Giraldo  And Bob Kelly  This is from 2010  A lot of people don't know that  Comedians Robert Kelly  And Greg Giraldo  Discuss issues they had in their relationships  Leading  Up to marrying their wives  As well as stories  Since being married  This was Greg Giraldo's 
[00:40:30]  Last appearance on the show  Yeah I think I just broke up with my  With my new girlfriend-y kind of person  Which is not good  But we do it a lot  Girlfriend-y kind of person  Yeah  Oh I thought you were breaking up with her  It's constant  It's a constant  Actually at one point  She  I thought she  I thought she had killed herself  Because she lives down in D.C.  And I called down  You know  But it turned out she was kidding  Oh Jesus  Just light heart  I was kidding  I didn't know what to do 
[00:41:00]  I'd been up all night  And she turned all her phones off  And everything  And I couldn't track her down  And I thought  I don't know  So finally in the morning  It was like hours ago  I couldn't know  I didn't know what to do  So I called the cops  In her community  She lives down in Virginia  And they said  They sent out cops  And they said  Okay we have to also  You know  You're going to have to file a report  With your local precinct  Because I guess to prevent harassment  And stuff like that  Well what do I need to do  And they said  Well just call your local precinct  In New York  And just get a form  They'll know exactly what it is  It's a form  It's very proper  So I called the precinct 
[00:41:30]  In New York  And they go  Well I don't know  What you're talking about  They said it would be a form  You know  Dude I'm not saying this  To say it  But we don't care  What happens in Virginia  Well  Fucking New York  Anytime there's a fight  At one of the clubs  Like they'll just go up  To both guys  You're both going to jail  Unless you both  Fucking drop it  Shut the fuck up  No it's very proper  Everyone will know  Any precinct does it  It's a matter of course  It's a proper form  The guy's like  Dude we don't care  What happens down there  Really  I mean if she's dead  What am I going to do 
[00:42:00]  From up here  Andy Griffith's  Being all cordial  And meanwhile  NYPD doesn't want  To fucking hear it  So why would you think  That she would do that  You were fighting  I just always assume  Everybody kills himself  If we stop talking  For any extended period of time  No  Yeah we were fighting  We've been fighting  You know  It's just all crazy  You know  Who knows  Does she want you  To think that  You think  Yeah well she told me that  I didn't just make it up  Out of the blue  Yeah  Yeah but  You called her  Your girlfriend-y  Kind of thing 
[00:42:30]  That's a real commitment  Well that's part of the problem  I guess  But you know  My divorce still isn't even final  So it's hard to get all excited  About anything going forward  Because I don't even know  How much I'll have left  Alright so you're going  Through that process  Yeah  Alright that explains a lot  No no  I understand completely  Yeah  That is probably  One of the most stressful  Just ugh  Miserable  All consuming things  That you have to deal with  Yeah well especially  If you feel guilty about it  Like I felt guilty  Going into you 
[00:43:00]  You go in with this  Why you felt guilt  Well because of like  Getting divorced  And she would have wanted  To stay married  I guess  Although she  You know who knows  But you know  I just blame myself  For everything  So I think  Alright I'll give her everything  It'll all be fair  It'll all be reasonable  And then over the course  Of the year  Mediation  Thinking like you entitled twat  You know  Yes  What the fuck do you think  You're in  Really  So you never work ever again  And just because  Because of why exactly  Because you  The lifestyle that they've  Become accustomed to  They have kids though  Two of you have three kids  Well no but that part's fine  The child support and everything  But yeah their lifestyle  They're accustomed to 
[00:43:30]  Which I always say like  You know it's always  What about my  What about the lifestyle  That I was accustomed to  No I'm not going to be able  To live the lifestyle  I'm accustomed to  Because you have to stay  With the one you were accustomed to  Yeah that's why I always say  If I ever get married again  I'm moving into a crack house  We're going to live in a crack house  And then enjoy  Enjoy the life  That you're accustomed to  Would you ever  Do you think you'd be  One of those two timers  I want to say  No I was married before  I got married when I was 23  I was married for two years  Oh okay  So this is number two  Yeah I'll definitely  Get married again  Not that I want to  But I will  I know I will  Really  It's out of your hands man  Larry King syndrome  You can't stop it 
[00:44:00]  It's out of your hands  It's out of your hands  There are certain kind of people  There are people that manage  To have kept their perspective  On women  You know  Somehow guys like Jimmy  And you know  People who manage to  To not just succumb  To the forces of it  And then there's people like Bobby  Who he doesn't want to be married  But he's got no power over it  He's right  He's absolutely right  Is that right  I fought  I fought  I fought my wife for 12 years  I fought her off  No you did pretty good  All things considered  Wow  You fought a good fight  But for me it's like  I don't even remember  Wanting to be married 
[00:44:30]  I don't even remember  Wanting to move in with people  And then somehow  It just happens  Clothes end up at your house  Yeah what the fuck  And then you can't even  It's just like  Takes on a life of its own  Were you  Bobby  Were you given like  A subtle  Or is it like  A covert  Or overt  Ultimatum  With marriage  No  That means a choice  I know what it meant  I know  Actually  I'm such a dummy

[00:46:30]  Or I gotta go  And I was like you know what  I'm gonna try to get my shit together  And if it works great  If it doesn't  You know  Then I know  So and then I  So you're talking  Some kind of infidelity  Might have taken place  Yeah  Alright  I mean that usually happens  When you're in the marriage  Yeah  Nobody cheats before  Well when you cheat  I mean  What I got caught doing  Was like serial killer shit  Do you know what I mean  Like she found like  Fucking like a box  Like Dexter  With blood samples  You kept souvenirs

So the marriage thing  Like you went to therapy  Yeah  But this is what  Fucks me up  Is like  I see guys  Before I got married  I would see guys like you  I even asked you  I'd always ask everybody  Who I know  Like you know  Were you ever  Fucking happy?  Like you know  I remember you  You were happy dude 
[00:49:00]  I remember at a point  I would see you come in  And I would see guys like you  And be like  Dude that fucking  Looks good to me  That shit looks good  Him and his wife  Will be at the bar  And you  I remember your wife  She was really cool  Was she?  Well yeah  Back then  I think Greg has a different opinion  We had a decent little run  When the kids started coming  You know  Like that's when things  There was like a three year period  Which is normally the hardest part  With kids  You know  You start having kids  You're not sleeping  It's a nightmare  But we had something  We were sharing in common  And it felt okay for a while  And I had my shit together 
[00:49:30]  And everything was fine  But you know  For the most part  No  Like I went into my marriage  Miserable kicking and screaming  I didn't want to do it  And it was one of those things  Where like you didn't even know  Consciously  Like she didn't manipulate me  Into doing it  She even says like  She didn't even want to get  Somehow they trick you  Dude I was a fat  I was  She didn't cry at the wedding  I did  I was a  And she walked up like  Hey what's up  And kissed me  I was a fucking  I was a pussy  So I wanted to get married  And I  Oh I thought you were crying  Cause you know  What  Cause I pretty much  Was crying at my wedding  But I was crying 
[00:50:00]  Because I was like  What did I just do  That's a good way  To spend your wedding night  My wife's attitude  Was like I got ya  At the wedding  Like yeah I'm cool  What's up  What are you doing dude  I think she called me dude  And then kissed me  What's up dude  Dude  I'm sitting there  Like a tear in my eye  Boom we kiss  You take this man  You take this woman  Bam we're married  Boom  There was no point  Where you fucking looked down  And went I love this  Not during my marriage  Not during my wedding  I was actually blacked out  During a lot of my weddings  At the time  I didn't even remember  I wasn't even conscious 
[00:50:30]  Of why I was doing it  You know  This was just the beginning  Of the end  I just got worse and worse  But I really didn't  Wasn't ready to do it  Didn't want to do it  Shouldn't have done it  In fact  When I was moved in with her  I had a sitcom  And this was in like 96  And I was subletting her studio  And she was working on some movie  In Florida  She came back  I was living in LA  We were dating  It wasn't even  And I had a sitcom  In fucking 96  I thought  This is not  She's in New York  I'm in LA  And I didn't want to cheat or anything  I was telling her  I don't want to have a girlfriend  And I were breaking up  I'd been married before  It was too soon  And she's like  You love me 
[00:51:00]  You don't want to lose me  You know  You really don't  I know you love me  You don't think so  But you do love me  And the thought  You really think you want me  With other guys  Oh fuck  She didn't play that one  Without being like too  But that's what happens  And somehow  You start to picture her  With other guys  And you're like  Fuck man  It becomes a possessive thing  Right  Yeah  And then you just think  Well shit  I can't handle that  So what do I do  I'll kind of try to  Just more or less  Keep it going  And next thing you know  You're married  But it wasn't like  She consciously  I mean yes  There were moments  That I thought  Like when I got engaged  I literally just got drunk  One day  It was raining  I got wasted 
[00:51:30]  I got on my motorcycle  It was raining  And I pulled it up  On the sidewalk  In front of Tiffany  Are you a Billy Joel song  Riding his motorcycle  In the rain  You want my hat  I might be  I might be crazy  And then I pulled up  And I left it there  And walked in  And just bought it  At fucking Tiffany's  It was ridiculous  Overpriced  Stupid waste of money  And rode back  And thought that was  Going to be the most  Romantic thing ever  Like I'm just  Wasted drunk  Soaked  Did she cry  Or she was like  She was excited at the time  And it did buy a little piece 
[00:52:00]  For a little while  How long were you married man?  I was married 10 years  Wow okay  Yeah see  Another one  Just hung in there  Well you had  Kids  Yeah the kids  The kids thing  Gave it hope  For a little while  And in fact  That's why I thought  We did have a little team  Going for a while  And then  But really  In her mind  It's all because  Of my substance  You know  My lifestyle issues  You know  I buy a lot of pens  Yeah I know  Those are expensive  Right now  I'm into mechanical pencils  Those are hot  Yeah yeah  I don't even bring that up dude  I can't take it  I bought a drafting table  Guys seriously  Guys seriously 
[00:52:30]  I bought crayons  And I molest children  What?  What?  I hate both  I'd rather fuck  A crayon than a kid  Sorry  Yeah see  I went through  The whole thing  With like nine years  Of just being miserable  Yeah  Just to keep  The status quo  And not have to go through  You know  Divorce  And bullshit like that  And then I was just  Starting to do radio  And thought 
[00:53:00]  You know  Oh good  I could throw myself  Into this  I don't have to  Think about  The marriage aspect  And then  You know  Things happen  Someone else  Trots along  Into your life  And goes  Oh  And you realize  Oh okay  I'm willing to give  All this up  Yeah  I want to fuck that  Yes  It is worth it  Sometimes  Yeah sometimes  And then in the long run  They just  Turn the screws on you  Yeah  And you pay through  The nose  But I don't know  Why I stayed  In it that long 
[00:53:30]  Like  I have no clue  Why I just  Stayed there  That long  Without  Kids  Without any  Mutual property  I didn't have a house  I didn't have anything  Yeah  You just start to think  That that's it  You know  This party  That just thinks  Well this is as good  As it's going to be  And it's  You know  It's got to take  A lot of pain  You know  If you weren't  The kind of person  That would tolerate  A lot of mediocrity  You wouldn't have  Gotten married  In the first place  Yeah  You know  Yeah  I like being married  The only thing that fucks  And sucks about being married  Is that I want to bang  On the broads  I mean that's the only part 
[00:54:00]  Yeah but that's a substantial  That's a substantial part of it  Yeah I know  Besides that one  Besides that one  Besides the only thing  That defines marriage  It's a perfectly  Yeah  What else is there really  Yeah but  I'm married but I want to  Eat more lettuce  Yeah but it defines  You do the dishes  I take out the garbage  I want to fuck other girls  There's other marriages  Out there that you can  Fuck on the broads  It just defines this  Our religion  Our religion  What marriage is  I mean  I want to fuck on the broads  I try  I really fucking fight that shit  But it's like  If there's a time 
[00:54:30]  Where my shit just dies  Where I don't  I'm just  Because I did a lot of fucking  In my life  I've been fucking  My whole life  Especially when doing drugs  And all that shit  Being young age  It doesn't build it  It's not like fucking runs  In one ball game  And the next day  They carry over  It does  Get out of your system  Every day  Get out of your system  You're not getting it  Out of your system  If you fucked a lot early on  It's not that you get out  Of your system  But as you get older  Your hopes and dreams  Just die  And you kind of just  You know  You look at yourself  In the mirror  And you're like  I don't want to listen  To her at a bar  After a show  I already know 
[00:55:00]  The scenario  So it's like  Ah fuck it  I'll go back to my room  And just fucking  Play with my pens  You know what I mean  And draw  But yeah  I mean  It doesn't get out of your  System  But you know  How it goes  So you play it out  In your head  And say fuck it  Ah fuck it  I'm done  I'm not going to do this  I do that with like  Movies that I've seen  And you go like  Oh I want to watch this  And then you play the movie  Real quick in your head  And go  Nah fuck it  So you do that with girls  You think  Ah I got to talk with her  At the bar  I got to do this  But then  There's always those 
[00:55:30]  Steven Seagal movies  That you'll fucking sit through  No matter what  But at any point of the movie  I'll watch it  You need the Steven Seagal  Of bitches  There's that girl  That frightens me  That fucking Jersey chick  Who's got a kind of  A fucking big nose  But a really good body  And oh  Well you really are  Holding out for the  Cream of the crop  No I don't  That's my problem  Big nose Jersey chick  So you're safe  Because what are the odds  You're going to come across  That she's an ovarian cyst  Gem  She wears a Mets hat  She wears a Mets hat 
[00:56:00]  You can see that  I don't want to cheat  But every once in a while  There's that girl from Jersey  With the big nose  That kind of walks  She lost her legs in a fire  Look in the car next to you  At any jug handle  And you'll fucking  Jug handle  Jug handle turns  And a stupid jug handle  Make a left you faggot  I fucking like those chicks man  A little dirty  A little greasy bitches  Like rock and roll  You know what I'm talking about  I absolutely know  What the fuck you're talking about  My point's not that  Those are skanks  But that they're not 
[00:56:30]  Exactly hard to come by  You make it sound like  You're okay  Except for one of these  When one of these  Crosses your path  One of these rare gems  Everything is fine  Just occasionally  A girl from Jersey  Comes into your path  And then what  Like that'll never happen  You know the sick thing  Every gig  Yeah exactly  It's not bad  If you see a girl from Utah  Because you're never there  Occasionally  You bump into one of these  Singaporeans  You're playing on  Staten Island  You don't think Jersey  Some big nose  Jersey girl  Is going to be  In the fucking clock 
[00:57:00]  Where am I playing  Aren't you playing  In Staten Island  Well it was Saturday night  Yeah  Uncle Vinny's  You scared me  Uncle Vinny's  That's the  Uncle Vinny's in Staten Island  You're playing there  In 1987  I might be closing it  This weekend  It might be the last weekend  I might be just  Shutting the doors  This weekend  I don't know  I get nervous man  I see you guys  Because you had to be  Happy at one point  And I'm just going to  Be fucking divorced  No you seem pretty happy  Actually  Relatively speaking  You seem really  Happily married  I mean the main thing  Is really loving the person  Being best friends 
[00:57:30]  With them  It's such a cliche  But if you really feel that  Then the rest of it  Kind of plays itself out  The girls thing  Because like you said  Especially if you're sober  You know  The fucking chicks thing  Does get old  At a certain point  I mean you do have to  Like them  You do have to be able  To listen to them  You do have to be able  To tolerate them  And that gets harder  When you're sober  So if you really like  The person  You know it kind of  Goes through  But my problem is like  You know  I don't know  This last girl  She would bring girls  She was totally cool  With me fucking around  How do you break up  How does that break up  Wow  Yeah  How does that not  That's when you realize  You're really a fucking asshole 
[00:58:00]  Like wow  Breaking up  Wow she was cool  With fooling around  Not only cool with them  She used to bring  Sometimes she would  Meet girls from AA  And bring them around  Just to keep me sober  She's not even in AA  Is she a vampire  You had a girl  At least she's not codependent  Who was going to AA for you  And meeting girls  Wow  No no no  Fantastic  She had friends  That were like  You know  They were sober  Whatever  I was doing this gig  In Florida  It was like a really stressful  Like a hard party club  Type of thing  Down at the Hard Rock  Down there  She was coming with me  And she said  I know it's going to be hard 
[00:58:30]  For you  She goes  You know  I know a friend  That moved down there  She's been sober  A long time  I'll have her meet us  I think she'd think  You were really cute  And we could all hang out  This way  You have something  To be excited about  You don't think about drinking  And I'm like  Nice strategy  Nice strategy  And somehow I fucked that up  Is she cool with  You being with someone  In front of her  Or  Oh yeah  Oh part  Okay  She likes to  Fuck you  Either way  And not even that  Then I said  At one point  I even said to her  I said listen  You know  I said  But I'm not comfortable  Talking  You know  Like if I'm on the road  And she's not with me  And I want to fuck around  Or something  I don't even want to  I feel like  I feel sleazy 
[00:59:00]  You know  She goes  Well you don't even  Have to tell me  Because that's part  Of the turn on  You could just lie  And I thought  Wow  That doesn't make sense  Yeah I don't know  It's very strange  That's part of the turn  You could lie  Wow  Yeah  Because I'm like  The man  You know  I want the man  To be like  So in charge  That you know  You don't have to  Answer me  And I thought  Wait but weirdly  Now I am answering to you  You know  You are telling me  You are strangely  Controlling me anyway  These fucking psychos  Somehow find a way  Whatever's wrong  In that relationship  Fix it  Fix it  And videotape it  Fix it  Good sweets  Good sweets 
[00:59:30]  Yeah that really  Was one of those  Where I'm like  Wait what are we  Breaking up about  Exactly  Like what  You know  We could do anything  And it was all  Because like  I had taken so long  With my divorce  And it didn't look  Like we were going  Anywhere  Which is ridiculous  Because I was  I did think  I was trying to get  The divorce done  And I did think  We were moving somewhere  But I'm just too  Fucked up  You know  I just can't  I can't seem  To do anything right  I just have my pens  The whole thing  With marriage  And getting married  Like Bobby says 
[01:00:00]  You're happy in your marriage  Yeah  You love your wife  Yep  Now I'm really getting  Kind of disillusioned  With this love thing  I'm not sure it's real  I think 99%  Of the relationships  I've ever been in  Have been 100%  Lust related  Love is compatibility  That's all it is  Well  Love is  There isn't  Listen  Is that on a little  Hummel  You fucking fairy  No dude  It's that  If you can 
[01:00:30]  It's got like  A little boy  And a little girl  And their noses  Are rubbing together  A butterfly  On one of the guys  Arm  It's dependent  I wear around my neck  It's just silhouettes  Of little kids faces  Love is compatibility  No it's not  There's no such thing  As love dude  It's like he said  That you can be  With a chick  For more than  Three hours  And not want to  Fucking stab her  On the neck  With a pencil  My wife can sit there  I can be with her  Day after day  And she doesn't  Get on my nerves  We don't have to talk  Like she'll be over there  Doing something  I'll be over here  For hours  But is that  The definition of love 
[01:01:00]  It's compatibility dude  That sounds like  You stay away from me  I'll stay away from you  And we'll be able  To cohabitate  No no no no  I'm just saying  That you can be together  And not fuck  All the chicks  I've been with  Fucking ten minutes in  I'm like  I can't wait  To fucking dump my load  And leave  I can't stand her voice  Yeah how many chicks  You've been with  But then there's  That chick  Or a couple of them  That you've been with  That you're like  I can hang with this chick  All the time  So that's  There was something  About your wife  That transcended  Just fucking  Yeah  We weren't dating for  We lived together  For like a year  And we're friends 
[01:01:30]  And then we  I left  I went to New York  She went to LA  And like we were  Friends for a long time  For twelve years  We were friends  What do you have  Friends like that  With a girl  Well we were on and off  Like I'd move in  We'd date  And then we'd  I'd leave  You'd have sex with her  During the friendship  Yeah  Then that ain't just  Fucking friends  But then I'd leave  For a year  And she'd leave  You know we'd talk  And we'd come back  You were a sailor  Being a merchant  I was  Bumped heads there  I was in the peace court  He was a merchant  He'd go off  And fight a war  Somewhere for money  Then I'd ship out  Never knowing 
[01:02:00]  Whether I'd return  You always tell  In a serious conversation  I don my cap  As soon as you  Missed her in Burma  As soon as you say  Something serious  And you're like  Oh boy  I see  I can feel  The fucking  You guys are like  Not the fucking lions  But the fucking  The fucking  Hyenas  Jackals  Are waiting for  A piece to fall off  Are waiting for  A rotten piece of meat  That's all we do  Then you say  Love is compatibility  Dude  And three light bulbs  Go off  It's just 
[01:02:30]  I don't  I don't get  The love part  Anymore  I thought I did  I thought  I knew it  I thought I  I did  But I realized  It  It came down to  I was in lust  I liked fucking  And I  Didn't  I didn't  Like the idea  Of her  Fucking  Someone else  Mix it all  Together  And that was  Anthony's version  Of love  That is the  Furthest thing  From fucking love 
[01:03:00]  Oh I want to  Marry you  Because I don't  Want you to  Fuck other guys  And I like  The way we  Fuck  And  I'm probably  Going to be  Sick of you  In a few months  I've had  That same  Sort of dynamic  And that's  That's a problem  That's a problem  With us  Because there are  People  And actually  I've had  Situations with  Girls since  Where I felt  Like  Okay  This is like  A friend  Now I get  What people  Are talking about  I just wanted  This is somebody  Who knows you  Exactly for who  You are  Because the other  Thing is  If you live  Like I'd lived  Before then 
[01:03:30]  My wife  She didn't know  Me really  She had this  Idealized version  Of who she  Thought she loved  And that guy  Wasn't the person  If you know  She loves this  Perfect dude  Who's not that guy  Then you know  It's the whole  Dishonest thing  All of a sudden  You meet people  That really know you  That know exactly  Everything you've done  Wrong in your life  And they still like you  They're like dude  Like you can meet girls  That are like your friends  Like a dude  That's hot  That you like to fuck  You know  Like Bobby  Yeah  And uh  Like wait a minute  I'm the guy  You want to fuck  Yeah  That's right  That's right  I better watch  How you sit  Around this place  Oh shit 
[01:04:00]  Fucking shit  God damn  What do you got  Like  Cause the girl  Let's you  She's like  I want you to lie  It's kind of  Which is very hot  Yeah  So what does she  Get mad at you for  It's gotta be something  There's gotta be  Like a trade off  On the other side  Like she's really cool  In this direction  But is there one direction  Well the thing is  It's hard to tell  But right now  It's cause it's long distance  She lives in DC  I live here obviously  Well she's got a cock  She has a cock  At the beginning  I thought that possible  Cause she was just too perfect  On paper she's too perfect  She's too perfect  There's nothing wrong with her  She's the hottest girl  I've ever seen  The coolest  You know  Like just ridiculous 
[01:04:30]  But you know  Ultimately it was like  I wasn't making enough moves  To get my marriage done  To be  You know  And she wasn't  And it wasn't even like  She pressured me about that  It wasn't even consciously that  It was just kinda like  I'm not sure what it was  It's the long distance thing  You know  Like she's not gonna move here  Until we  You know  Until we're really  Ready to move in together  But I don't know  That I'm ready to do that  And with the kids  And a whole bit  It's just a giant clusterfuck  Right  But I probably will regret it forever  Cause I think that  That this could've been  You know  This could've been a bad move 
[01:05:00]  But ending it you mean?  Well it's not even up to me  I mean it's kinda like  We're collectively ending it  Cause what am I gonna do  Get divorced instantly tomorrow  It's a big pain in the ass  To go through that whole process  But also  Like that sounds good  Like you said on paper  It's perfect  But I think  As  What if you did hook up  You're living together  That just doesn't sound like  Something long term  That would work  Well the thing about  The other girls  Thing is that's a minor part of it  It's almost like  Weirdly enough  Once it didn't matter  It's not like every day  It wasn't like  Some rampant crazy sex craze thing  It was like 
[01:05:30]  When we're together  We'd go on the road together  And it was always like  If I wanted her to go meet girls  Cause she was into girls  If she wanted to be  But she wouldn't care  We wouldn't see each other that much  So when we would hang out  It wasn't like  It was a crazy  Sick orgy from morning to night  It was just two people hanging out  When you don't feel that fear  That holy shit  I'll never fuck another girl again  Strangely  It goes away  Kind of  It becomes like  It's the same  That's something I went through  For years though  It was the oh my god  This has to be the last girl  That's ever gonna fuck me  What horrid self esteem 
[01:06:00]  To just think that  And that's why  You know  Saying I love you  Would come out of my mouth  Like do you wanna have coffee  I would just be  The second my dick came out  I'd be like  Hey I love you  And that just was  The end right there  The second I would say it  Would just be the beginning  Of the fucking rollercoaster  Of doom  For the relationship  It would take a long time  It was a hell of a long  Rollercoaster ride  But  Because I wasn't in love  I fucking love my wife 
[01:06:30]  I really do  I could cry  Looking at my wife  I'm sure she feels the same  Again  I knew  I knew  Wait wait  It comes in threes  I'm not fucking  I'm not moving on  Go ahead  By the way  I actually don't even feel bad  Like this is the last girl  Is this the girl  I want to fuck me  I actually feel worse  For the woman  It's like  I've seen myself new  And I got side fat  And a penny scar  She has to look at this  Yeah but Dawn met me  Just doughy tits in her face  For the rest of her life  Dawn met me  13, 14 years ago 
[01:07:00]  When I  Oh my god  When you were sexy Bobby Kelly  Oh he was delicious  And now in the last  You know five years  I kind of  Hey let's  And she's like  Alright well I guess  I  Now I'd be going back  On my  What I was saying  But yeah  I'll stick with you now  Does the sex thing drop off  See that's the fucked up thing  And then new girl  Oof  You're fucking five times a night  Yeah  Marriage  Years go by  I'm going to watch the game  I'm going to watch this 
[01:07:30]  I'm going to do something else  I'm going to play video games  I'm going to  New girl  You can't get your fucking hands off of  Yeah  Although I got to tell you  I never really got tired  Of having sex with my wife  Like that's one thing  That kept us going  For such a long time  I always thought like  This is actually alright  You know like  It must mean something  You know like  All her friends  Husbands weren't fucking them anymore  And all that kind of stuff  You know  And she's like  Well we fuck all the time  We must be in love  I guess we are  Maybe we are  Maybe I was  But that's what  Like you said  What does love even mean  What does it matter  Like maybe we were  Maybe that is what love was for me  You know but for some reason  It wasn't enough 
[01:08:00]  Yeah I tend to think  And it's so stupid and sappy  I tend to have thought  That it was like this  You'd know this thing  It would be magical  Yeah  Oh it's love  Oh this is it  Oh my god  And then you realize  No  It's just a combination  Of a bunch of things  That if mixed right  It turns into something  That is labeled love  But it's not this mystical  Magical connection  Between two people  Bullshit  You're fucking  You know  You're cohabitating 
[01:08:30]  Every so often  You'll duke it out  Over something  You'll fuck  Hopefully it's good  You'll be able to tolerate  Each other for a few years  I can't  I just can't see it as  What?  I just love you  Jimmy I'm so broken  I am a busted human  All I'm thinking is  As you're saying this  You fuck him  You kick him out  You got a gun on  In your own house  You're out of your fucking mind  He's insane  You gotta wear the gun  In your house  Someone's gonna come in 
[01:09:00]  You can't ask him  You know  Wait for me to get my gun  You are right  You know  Most of the idea  Of romantic love  Anyway  Is  It's considered totally sick  By modern standards  You know  The idea of like  It's all like  Totally dysfunctional  Crazy codependent  Like Romeo and Juliet  All these truly romantic stories  That people kill themselves  Over each other  And can't be a part  We can't be a part  That's sick  That's like  It's not  So what the fuck is love?  It definitely is  This obsessive thing  You're obsessed with a person  To the point where  You know  You're not acting rationally 
[01:09:30]  That's  That's love  No  Come on  My wife's a soldier  Dude  She's been with me  She's let me do  So much fucked up shit  And stood by me  She's been there  She's like  Probably the friend  It's like  So love is  Is putting up with  So much horse shit  And not leaving  Well you  Wow that sounds romantic  No but you get  I don't get it  You're saying  It's either or  There's a bunch of  Fucking good shit too  It's not just  I was  I treated  I kicked her in the  Fucking stomach every week  And she put up with it  We had a lot of  Fucking good times 
[01:10:00]  Pen shopping  No she doesn't like that  I can't  Fucking came home with a $300 pen  Why  Why do we need that  I bet you couldn't  You couldn't stop using it  Just to prove it  She was a good buy too  He'd probably wear it  Behind his ear around the house  Yeah I wanna write something down  Boom  No it's too big  You wanna write something down  Boom  Boom  You got your pen right here  Boom  You got a fucking iPhone  A Macbook  Everything else you can type on  What do you need  A phone number  Boom  The cartridge for the ink  Across the napkin  The cartridge for the ink  Costs 20 bucks  And it runs out like every week  I would fucking hand you $300 
[01:10:30]  And then break that pen  In front of you  Really  It'd be so worth it  I'd peshy you in the neck  With it  Exactly  A good Mori-ing  With the fucking  Hope that Bob would never  Shut the fuck up  About this pen  Casino  Casino  Casino  And he's jabbing him  With the pen  I was actually looking  At the pen  Like what kind of pen  Is that  Yeah that was  The best part of the movie  For Bobby  It's a fucking pen  It's great  Even outside of marriage  Is fucking depressing  Like you can't buy yourself  A couple pens  She looks at it  A $300 pen  You make all the money 
[01:11:00]  Like you know that guy  Mike Campbell  From Tom Petty  And the Heartbreakers  Guitars from Tom Petty  And the Heartbreakers  In Rolling Stone  Last month  Or last week  He said he bought  This new Gibson  Les Paul  It was like a $250,000 guitar  Jesus  Changing his sound  He's a fucking rock star  He's played  The Heartbreakers  And he bought this guitar  And it changed his sound  It changed his whole thing  And he said  He had to clear  After clearing it  With the wife  Like you're a fucking rock star  He's still got to clear it  With the wife  You know  Is it okay for me  To rock star  To buy a guitar  And you know  Do you think she's  Bringing in all the bucks  I got a big fight  About the iPad  I was like 
[01:11:30]  I'm gonna look  She's like  Look we don't need  I'm like  Big fucking fight  And then I got  I got her one  I was like  You'll fucking get one too  Fuck you  Did it work  Yeah she loves it  Sitting every night  I go you like that huh  Wow you really showed her  I love it  You got quite a strategy  I'll buy you one  She's smart  She knows how to work  This idiot  I'll just object to it  I can buy anything I want  As long as I get her  Something really expensive too  Bobby got it for me  I'm sitting here  Boom  I'm done  I'm playing through my yaps  I got it 
[01:12:00]  She talks like that  I'd punch her in the face  Imitation of your wife  Yeah no  Fuck you dude  If she talks like that  I'd punch her in the concert  I like  Shut the fuck up  I love the iPad though  The eye  It's all just fingerprints on it  Looking at it  It's enraging  You can't do anything with it  It's all fingerprints  Yeah  Bugs me  Swipe it off  I know  But you want to watch a movie  Swipe it off  It's fucking annoying  Open my laptop  I hate the iPad  You don't hate it  You'll have one  Guarantee you will

[01:13:00]  Well you were pretty Bobby  No I was on my second fat  I got sober  I was in shape  Because of rehab  I was in rehab for a year  And I came out really shredded  And then I got fat  Because I literally  Didn't know how to talk to women  I got out of rehab  And I remember trying to talk to this girl  That lived next to me  And I was telling her  All my emotions  Like yeah  I mean I don't drink a drug anymore  But you know  God is good  And I pray to God  But it's not like God God  It's like a higher power  Like you can believe in 
[01:13:30]  Whatever you want to believe in  That is compatibility  Fuck  Dude she fucking ran  How fast did she get run  Just gone  I remember the only chick  That would fuck me  Was the chick behind my house  And her pussy was so big  It just went  Flip  Flip  Flip  Flip  And I wanted to throw up  Every time I fucked this bitch  Was it big like meaty  It was  Every time  Flip  Flip  Every time I pushed my  I would love that  Small dick into her  I would love that  Made me want to puke

[01:36:00]  Let's see  Something else is breaking down  And plus I stubbed my toe  And that's what bothers me the most  So can you fix the toe?  Sure  Absolutely  Let's see your feet Tom  Yeah let's see him  By the way who's working the pal talk cameras?  No  I may stick the place up  No one's working the pal talk cameras  I got my new socks on  Yeah  Yeah dad you know how to do that  And I have to keep them on  That's right where Tommy  My doctor told me  Because I stubbed my toe 
[01:36:30]  All right Dr. Steve is listening to his heart  Steve you gotta give us commentary  Okay  I'm just listening to his heart  And it actually sounds pretty darn good  You can take this working huh?  Yep  Oh  That's good  That's good  Take a deep breath for me  Take a deep breath  Oh boy  Emphysema for everyone  Occasionally  Well I mostly smoke other things 
[01:37:00]  I'm just gonna feel it  I smoke corn silk  Corn silk  How is his lungs?  Where do you get that in the city?  How is his lungs?  They get in a cornfield in Jersey  Where do you think you're gonna get it at?  All right  They got it in Long Island too  Steve?  Okay  Now Tom you know your liver's a little enlarged  I think my liver is a little enlarged  Oh that's not 
[01:37:30]  Can I see your  Can I see your  What you're feeling Steve is the help me sign  The liver's holding up  Oh the ankle no good  Ankle no good  Yeah this is where it gets serious  Well this one's not too bad  No Tom  No this one uh worse  Yeah Dr. Steve is looking at  Well I gotta cover it up  Tippy Tom's ankles  But they're not too bad  I can still walk  Yeah  So obviously everything is Steve  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve's been happy  Well they go up and down you know 
[01:38:00]  Yeah  You know some days up some days down  Dr. Steve it's been about a year  Really?  That I've seen it like that  Yeah  Well  You get shorter breath when you lay down?  No  Okay  All right  What do you think that means this ankle?  When you have big ankles  It can be from a lot of things  But it's always fluid  And it's just the question  Edemia?  Edema  Edema I mean?  Yeah where is the fluid coming from?  Now  In his case  What this really looks like 
[01:38:30]  Is a thing called venous stasis  Which is just  It's from gravity  Pulling on the veins  In the legs  Yeah gravity  And then  I did not know that  And fluid  Now I know  Fluid leaks out from the veins  And  We'll talk about that after the show  But if you elevate your legs  When you're laying down  That'll actually help that  That is true  Yes  Elevate them  That's what I do  Yep  Oh good  Yeah  Yeah  But you know  I lay on concrete 
[01:39:00]  Because it helps my back too  Because I got a bad back  Okay  So I lay on a flat surface  And elevate my dukes  My dukes  My feet  And that way there  The blood circulation run right  So because when I wake up  If I go to sleep  If I'm lucky  Then I wake up  Or get up  When I'm getting up  When I'm done laying down  So I can walk  You spend most of the day  On your feet  Because I like to walk  Around town  Yeah 
[01:39:30]  Now the thing  That I'd like to do next  Is what we talked about earlier  Is to check your prostate  And check your rear end  My prostate lens  Yep  Well that might be a job  You want to go up my ass?  Yep  What we'll do  Is we'll have you  Drop your drawers  And I'll have you  Bend over the table  And we'll bring up  Right here?  Yep  We'll bring up  A sheath  So that nobody can see you  So something  A camera?  No  And I'll just use my finger  And we'll just test you for blood

He's just got a lot of fluid in there 
[01:45:00]  And when the skin stretches out like that  Blood can't get to the capillaries  And it causes a thing called stasis dermatitis  Which is just a thickening of the skin  And you know  He can crack and break  And he can get infected  And it can cause some problems  So he needs to get looked at  He needs some elastic stockings  How does he cure that?  Getting off his feet  Part of his problem is  He's probably on his feet  16 hours a day 
[01:45:30]  Right  Can he lose his legs?  Because that's what we worry about  If he got an infection there, yeah  Oh wow  Yeah, it's a possibility  Alright  He's got  Poor circulation too  Poor circulation, that's what it is  It's Memorial Day  And we're reliving some of our favorite moments  With friends we've lost  Whole lot of fucking going on here  In memoriam

[01:47:00]  He was a great guy  But I didn't talk about his band for years  Maybe other people have  But I haven't  That's the difference  But now  You will finally get to hear the music of Foundry  This is the debut of the smash single Pendulum  Steve, where's your music?  Yeah  Here it comes  He goes right here  Oh, he looks so sad  Come on, Foundry 
[01:47:30]  No energy  He's like, oh, it's right here  Where is it?  Give me that CD  Before he thinks about taking it back  No, I can't take it back  I want to enjoy the whole CD  Give it to me  Alright  The cover art  The name of the CD you guys put out was  What Kills Me?  That's right  Our own Steve  Very aggressive  And you were the singer?  Uh-huh  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not? 
[01:48:00]  How'd your parents die?  I'm never talking to you again, Jimmy  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Did you hand this CD to Aunt and I  When we were working at AAF?  I might have  I think I  Probably  I'm caught with a group called Foundry  It was very hard to find and navigate  Come here  Oh, oh, oh  I probably did  Because I used to work those beach parties  That you guys did at  What was that?  Fitchburg Center?  Fitchburg  Whatever that stupid indoor hockey arena was  The indoor beach party  In Fitchburg, Massachusetts 
[01:48:30]  Because I would work security at those things  Where's all the other guys?  Could you just give this a listen?  I guarantee you  Steve right now is secretly hoping  That there's a big talent scout listening  No, I'm not  Who will recognize that Foundry was a band that was overlooked?  Trust me  I've heard enough  I've heard enough  Demo CDs  And befriended enough of the guys  That I grew up listening to  To know  That this is not going to be  Isn't it exciting though  When you finally get the package in your hand  And you're a band  And you're like  Yeah  Here it is, man  It's going to make it, man  You guys all listen and tap your toes 
[01:49:00]  At the time, ten years ago  Yeah, you're ecstatic  You're like, wow  Guys  You guys weren't looking at this closely  Oh, no, what?  I'm bummed that you guys don't have thank yous  Yeah, those are always fun  I thought we did  But Steve, would you like to let everyone know  What your rock name was?  Oh, my God  Oh, yeah  Steven Carr  That's right  Let me clarify one thing  Oh, boy  I forgot about that  If I find out  If you spell the C-A-R-R 
[01:49:30]  Yeah  I'm going to smash  Did you?  into your face  Yes, I did  Fucking cucks  Grr, grr  Steve hybrid it is now  It's Steve Carr  Let me try to start myself  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  Yeah, I'm out of gas.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is Steve Carr on vocals.  I forgot about that.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Was Steve Douche taken? 
[01:50:00]  Everybody in the band had, like, a very antiseptic, cool-ass name,  and I was the one guinea in the group.  Steve Carr.  I said I had to fit in.  Carr, yeah.  That's fucking horrendous.  It's better than Steve Lisi.  Oh, exactly.  Steve Lisi or Steve Carr.  Oh.  Oh.  It's a good name.  It's a good name.  You're.  I Lisi my.  Hold on.  I got to tell myself it was a good one, too, you bastard. 
[01:50:30]  Steve Carr.  I wish I would have seen that.  I didn't get it.  Well, there it is right there.  C-A-R-R.  R-R.  Foundry is Stephen Carr, lead vocals and guitar.  Stephen Carr.  I bet you a dummy practice his autograph.  Steve.  Yeah.  Oh, I did.  I used to.  And the last two R's trailed off.  Ah.  No, the T used to intersect every other letter, I think.  Yeah, it was awful.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  That was close.  Steve Carr. 
[01:51:00]  Grr.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  Thank you, sweetie.  Oh.  Steve.  Oh, let's see your autograph.  Come on, Steve Carr.  We should do old-time concert commercials for Foundry.  Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Steve.  Love all the stuff.  Featuring Steve Carr.  Steve Carr.  Carr.  Carr.  Carr.  Carr.  How many times did you rehearse the speech at the Grammys?  They normally don't recognize this kind of music.  I'm sure I had those conversations with myself, like, you know, in the shower or at night. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, would I win that Grammy?  Large boy.  Oh, all 400 pounds of me.  All right, Steve.  Imagining, like, Jeopardy, having a question, like, this lead singer of a popular band is  actually named Steve Carr-Lisi, and everyone knows it.  Who is Steve Carr?  Steve Carr is correct.  That's right.  Yes, Steve Carr.  This band actually put out one CD, and it sucks a bag of ass.  Whose favorite?  Wow.  This was everything to this guy back in 97. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what song should we play?  Steve Carr should have gone to the junkyard to be crushed.  Steve Carr should have carried Harry Chapman on his back.  Steve Carr should have baby seats in the back backing into a lake.  Steve Carr should have a hose taped to the side of his face.  Oh, this is really awful. 
[01:52:30]  Steven Carr.  Steve Carr.  I used to wear these awful get-ups with, uh, I had, since I was sore,  so big I couldn't buy stage clothes in normal, I couldn't buy off the rack, so I was going  to Elaine Bryant, the fat woman shop.  Oh, my God.  The fat woman shop.  Steve Carr gets his clothes from Elaine Bryant.  We'll tell you more in this issue of Tiger Beat.  And I had this, uh, yes, indeed.  Oh, God damn.  How did this go so long?  How long have we known Steve?  I have kept this intentionally. 
[01:53:00]  Eight years?  Very, yeah.  Eight years I've kept this muffled.  Oh, my God.  All right, so you would go to Elaine Bryant, and what would you buy for your crazy stage outfit?  A 3X leopard skin blouse.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  I had that.  I had, uh, I had gold sequined Doc Martens.  I had, uh...  You're divine.  Yeah.  You are divine.  Yeah.  I think...  I think I had, uh... 
[01:53:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's more than terrible.  My girl wants to borrow my shirt all the time.  Steve Carr.  Oh, you stink.  It was awful.  I had...  I wore black eyeliner when I was, uh...  We gotta blow up the lyrics, because they're really ridiculous.  Oh, are there lyrics?  Why didn't I look at that?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're too...  You're just not observant, Jimmy.  What kills me. 
[01:54:00]  Wow.  Music by Stephen Carr.  Lyrics by Stephen Carr.  Ew, you were Stephen Carr?  Like that was like...  Stephen Carr.  Like Stephen Tyler?  Right.  It's hard to read.  Can't be Steve Carr.  Stephen Hawking Stephen King?  Did you think about it?  Should it be Steve Carr or Stephen Carr?  What was the big...  I probably did.  I probably...  What was the big hit?  What kills me?  Uh, I'm trying to think.  Yeah, that was one.  The hit.  That was the hit.  I want to live.  I want to dream.  I want to fly.  I want to die.  I think there was one.  I think the one that was called Tell Your Story was, uh... 
[01:54:30]  was the one that...  And by hit, we are just leaving the S off the front.  Yeah, exactly.  They're all crap.  Please blow up the lyrics so we can hear it.  We can sing along.  And the course of my existence isn't yours to compromise.  I was written by...  I want to love.  I want to hate.  I want to punch a girl in her vagina.  I want to do promos that nobody gets.  I want to turn and deviate.  Play the hit, Ramone.  Bring me a cloth. 
[01:55:00]  A little taste.  What song do you want us to play?  You can play the first one.  That's fine.  Pendulum?  Yeah.  Pendulum by...  They all have long...  As performed by Stephen Carr...  Stephen Carr.  In the band Boundary.  Swings back and forth like a pair of balls when you're wearing a Lane Bryant dress.  It was a blouse, Jimmy.  A blouse.  A blouse.  Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr.  Wow.  We're waiting for the lyrics to be blown up. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  We want to sing along.  Oh, people are just...  They're suggesting photoshops now that are just ridiculous.  I'm sure.  I kept this so under wraps for so long.  I knew that it was going to come out.  Ted Kennedy should drive you into Chappaquiddick.  Steve Carr crash.  Oh, man.  Strap in.  Yeah, just strap in.  I remember Jimmy... 
[01:56:00]  When I told Jimmy about this,  he looked at me and he just was laughing.  And I said,  What are you laughing about?  He said,  I'm just trying to decide if we're going to get one or three hours out of this.  You knew it had to be.  You're getting thrown under the car.  What are the rest of the boys doing in the band?  I think one of them is still playing in bands in Boston.  The other guys all had day jobs.  And that's what kept everybody in Boston.  And I was just like,  I don't want to do this anymore.  And I moved back to Jersey.  Because there was just...  The scene in Boston was Godsmack and everybody else at that point. 
[01:56:30]  I think Stained was just starting up at that point, too.  Godsmack and Foundry would be a good...  Foundry.  Nice double bill.  Sully and Stephen Carr posing for a magazine.  Stephen Carr.  If only.  That's what he wanted.  Yeah, that's what you want.  That's what you wanted, right?  At 22, that's what I wanted.  I wanted to be...  I thought I wanted to be a rock star.  And then I came to the realization that everybody...  You get copies for everybody?  Godsmack and Goddreck.  Here, Jimmy. 
[01:57:00]  God, you've been blown up.  The lyrics are beyond tiny.  Very tiny.  Had to fit all of my creativity in a very small space.  Oh, we were broke.  We recorded this in two days in a...  I think it was in Austin or something like that.  Some studio.  Wow, here's a number that went undialed for bookings call.  What will that number get you now?  I have no idea.  It's probably residential.  We should call it and say, can we book a foundry?  Is Stephen Carr there?  You know what?  You should send this down to Washington and get this on the Unsigned Channel. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Stephen Carr.  You guys have the fucking worst names.  Stephen Carr.  And then there's Alan Stratton.  Write that number down.  See if anyone answers.  And if they want to, like, come on the radio.  I guarantee what you're going to hear is it's going to be a voicemail.  Hi, this is Steve.  I can't come to the phone right now.  It's just his cell phone.  It's going to ring in his pocket.  It's going to ring on my hip.  Right.  All right.  Here comes from the lyrics.  So we're going to play Pendulum by Foundry.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  With Stephen Carr on guitar.  All these songs are pretty close. 
[01:58:00]  There's somebody out there.  You guys ever play a show?  Yeah, a bunch.  Did you?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  I don't even get the first line.  What's the first line?  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day.  Another condescension.  Oh, just another.  It says day.  Mock you.  Shock you.  Going to lock you down.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Pendulum will swing at the center of attention. 
[01:58:30]  How does a pendulum swing?  Everyone's looking at it swing?  I guess, yeah.  All right.  Did you just look for things that rhymed?  No, I did have a rhyming dictionary.  Pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow, and the pendulum will get you.  It's the pendulum that will get you.  Show you.  Mow you.  Going to throw you around.  Ew.  Show you.  Well, mow you.  Mow you.  How appropriate.  Maybe we shouldn't pay this place.  God, I can't take this picture of you, though. 
[01:59:00]  It should have been Stephen as big as a.  Wait till you see line three.  This is where the writing gets good, Stephen.  Oh, okay.  Hindenburg.  You did the crime, but not the time.  You went there, didn't you?  You did the crime, but not the time.  Don't do the crime if you can.  Do the time.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the crime you committed?  Impersonating a retarded person writing lyrics?  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear. 
[01:59:30]  My back is going to break if you push me in the rear.  Push it in my rear.  If you push me one more time.  It doesn't even rhyme.  It does.  If you hear the rhyme scheme at all.  My back is going to break.  Exactly.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  Sting.  I was 22.  It's like one of Jimmy's poems.  It really is.  You make me look like fucking mammoth.  No, I don't.  It wasn't a poet, but you get it.  You change me into something that I just can't control. 
[02:00:00]  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  Got no choice in the matter.  Yeah, exactly.  Shaped like a bulldozer.  If you see me coming, put on certain glasses and you'll see me pass in front of the sun.  Because the pendulum is swinging back the other way.  Pendulum can take only so much yelling, but he'll do next. 
[02:00:30]  What he'll do next?  What he'll do next?  There's no telling.  Like dog shit, this song is smelling.  Bump you, chump you, gonna dump you out.  Pendulum will break under too much tension, breaking down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking, balling, kingdom falling down.  And that is all the words to Pendulum.  So now you can follow along at home with the actual music from the band Foundry, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:01:00]  Listen to the words.  Is there a little intro music?  Yeah, all of our songs had very long intros.  Very long intros.  Electric drum triggers and everything.  Oh, great.  What instrument did you play, Sweetie Pie?  Guitar.  Eric, here's the man.  As that tiny little thing in front of me would indicate.  Oh, I see.  Blown up bigger, and so is Steve in this picture.  Wow, you are just a shell of your former self.  I am so proud to look at you now.  Thank you, Anthony.  When you were giant.  How much did you weigh back then?  1650. 
[02:01:30]  Pushing 400.  I mean, at that point, who's counting?  I really was huge.  I have like a 50-inch waist, I think.  All right.  Pendulum.  Okay, good.  All right, here we go.  Get ready to rock.  Cut off the top of Pendulum.  Here it is, people.  Foundry.  On the only station that really rocks.  That's right.  This is Foundry.  Pendulum.  Featuring Stephen Carr on lead vocals and guitar.  Stephen Carr going to be joining us in studio later on. 
[02:02:00]  Crank it up.  Talk about his new album.  This is Pendulum on the only station that really rocks.  Yeah.  This is so good.  I repressed this. 
[02:02:30]  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  This is a grind and not the time.  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You're better on.  That all I can take of all you screaming in my ear.  Back is gonna break it.  If you push me one more time.  I, I, I, I, I.  My heart's getting heavy. 
[02:03:00]  My blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  You see me come and let's get out of my way.  Can?  That's, that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Why not?  What are you doing in my house?  Get the fuck out.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  I can take over so much, girl. 
[02:03:30]  And what it'll do next?  Let's go down.  And I'll both do a champion.  Gonna come be right.  I can't take it, man. 
[02:04:00]  He's tapping out.  I'm on my side.  I, I, I, I.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control.  Maybe you see me come and let's get out of my way.  But fans, I love you swinging back the other way.  Yeah.  Obligatory guitar. 
[02:04:30]  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buried in reverb.  wild stallions  yeah bring it down every bad boy has a soft side  that's terrible i'm sorry 
[02:05:00]  why not 
[02:05:30]  there you go foundry pendulum on the only station that really rocks you know what it wasn't it's not  that bad you gotta be you gotta be honest with the guy it's not that bad it's not it's not that  good either no it's not that bad considering it was we were hoping it was a lot worse trust me 
[02:06:00]  uh let's see um well the instant feedback doesn't uh think so yeah i'm sure they don't  i'm sure they're savage animal oh yeah he sings monotone too  um really like what i sing jingles all the time you've heard me sing steve from philly  is this singer a great big fat person he sounds like um the announcers uh the news announcer from 
[02:06:30]  south park okay sing a little something acapella i know you can who's fronting the band kim jong  eel kim jong eel from team america a lot of people thrown in the south park reference  steve once bit the head off an ostrich on stage is that true  i got a question hungry enough do you got a slow one uh yeah but power ballad no no power ballads  no what no but you slowed it down i slowed it down i slowed it down on one track that i wrote for  my sister but i don't want to play that you can't play that oh all right the honey pot is swinging 
[02:07:00]  back the other way what other one you want to play there steve uh let me see let me see the  thing thank you i'm telling you i haven't heard this in years quite intentionally he makes them  play at parties my mother my mother plays this at her house and she's good because she's so proud  she's like my son did this and i'm like mom turn it off she couldn't be proud she probably does that  when people are like gonna eat and they shouldn't eat she puts it on it just wrecks their appetite  oh let's see when you're all blocked up and you can't shit they have this in the bathroom 
[02:07:30]  she plays it when she wants to empty the house yeah when she wants the company to leave yeah the  company needs to go home this is crank up some foundry this is my son haven't heard anything  like that since the song from boogie nights hello exactly but the magic that's on that tape is ours  we look like assholes man you could do i'm steven carr i'm trying to think which one has the more  cliche lyrics you could try it try five or seven let me see which one would tell me the name's on yeah 
[02:08:00]  because that might just be he might be a one-hit wonder yeah with the pendulum something tells me that  it's uh i'm spewing cliches left and right he was very uh he was very confident with uh pendulum yeah  he was like oh play play pendulum tell your story or burned those are burned let's look at the lyrics  what's it about what was but what should happen to these cds nothing who are you to force my hand  i can barely understand this battle that i'm going through is raging between me and you 
[02:08:30]  i've got a feeling that you keep me kneeling when you see me coming don't run this war has only begun  and you can tell your story to the man in the moon he's the only one listening to you  and you can plead your insanity until you turn blue but he's the only one listening to you  the man in the moon funny how you speak your mind to the scum of humankind the little bit i try to do  is all i need to bury you ominous all right someone read uh burned where is it i'm afraid i can't get 
[02:09:00]  through that was scary wasn't it where's burned i see it there it is sweetie so take another piece of  me it takes you where you want to be it seems you'll win at any cost because there's another  friend you lost oh challenging observation steven  steven  mondo talentless  i challenge you to not throw up while these songs are playing sexy steven car 
[02:09:30]  in his leopard print blouse raising the temperatures all right you were taking it all  but you still wanted more and you never knew what hit you till they found you on the floor oh when the  hammer came down you had your back turned they should have told you when you started the fire you 
[02:10:00]  were gonna get burned  wow that stuck and whoever got hit by that hammer can consider themselves lucky that their listening  experience was over and uh m boogie from upstate new york said what's my problem you're in my  fucking blouse  so do we try burned oh there's only a little bit more now all right go ahead somewhere your life got left 
[02:10:30]  behind your avarice was on your mind you say that money's all you need well that's not wisdom  that's just greed of course it is you want to know if the rest of your band was brock landers and  chest rockwell  and if you cover the song i'm a winner  so you take a so take another look at you you did just what i said you'd do i guess you wanted any 
[02:11:00]  cost because that's your only life you lost wow steve man you got you know something i got to give you  credit because this is really hard this is not easy but why i think steve is secretly proud of  this are you not camping no he's secretly a foundry ten ten years ago i was quite proud of this but  now in retrospect there's a guy on the line that actually liked uh the song we played cool but first  mike in new orleans mike well i was wondering i got two questions for steve one i wanted to know uh 
[02:11:30]  when he went to lane bryant did he get the braziers to snap in the front  one other question was uh did he ever when he was leaving the gig get approached by a guy wanting  to help with a bad hand trying to help him get a chair to me you're about signed 300 let's get a  help over there someone who actually likes his uh yeah let's go to billy smithtown then we'll get to  that guy billy yo what's up billy what's going on guys i wanted to know if on steve's uh rider he  requested a live barrel of salmon every night a live what barrel of salmon mondo stomachless

[02:22:30]  an opie and anthony special  continues  hey we're back  with me clubby  memorial day weekend  opie and anthony in memorial special  we continue  george carlin  2007  this is mr carlin's last appearance on the show  he was in promoting what would be his last hbo special 
[02:23:00]  and dvd box set of all his hbo specials  we also discuss mr carlin's years in radio  see it was written we also discussed george's years in radio but like that's not respectful  so i improv'd and changed it to mr carlin  that's what i'd do  so to continue  we also discuss mr carlin's years in radio  and how horrible 
[02:23:30]  the news is  i don't know what news so you better listen  you're checking out the opie and anthony show  we're already having a great time with george carlin and we're just getting back on the radio  now we gotta say all the stuff we were saying during the commercial break there george  i'm just watching fan move the microphone in front of carlin like he doesn't know how to work a mic  oh fan trolling for fish or something  we want to say we want to say it to your face uh we get we're fortunate enough to interview a lot of people with this uh radio show 
[02:24:00]  and uh every once in a while someone comes through that door where we're like starstruck and uh a little freaked out  and you're one of those guys and and it's only a handful of times this has happened over the years  thank you now calm down  well right we're all obviously huge fans and we love everything you've done  very nice i really appreciate it 50 years right 50 years since i went into radio in 1956  wow 40 was just starting rock and roll was just starting i was 18 
[02:24:30]  and i had the advantage of uh having a car down in shreveport i was a shreveport luciana i was in the air force  and i could go out at night and tell the chick  hey you want to hear a song tomorrow i'll dedicate it to you what do you want  you know it was magic magic man two two paychecks didn't have to do anything on the airbase  just do my show that's why it's just never changed as far as that goes that's why  that's why there's a way to get girls that's why most people got into radio was for the free cds well 
[02:25:00]  free cds now whatever free music and and and hopefully picking up a few extra women on the side  trade-outs with the sponsors right right yeah the whole plugola the payola  what was uh radio must have been a hell of a lot different uh back then than it is now especially  did you have freedom to yeah really talk and and and say what you want you didn't have a pd up your  it was the first stage of top 40 so personalities were still in play and you had a kind of an  a persona on the air and they they'd set your pictures out you know and all that and i was a 
[02:25:30]  young guy so they wanted you know we we had a lot of young listeners naturally and um and and so they  wanted to have a like a fan club and all that stuff and yeah uh the thing about it was our radio  station was a daytime take this it was a day timer and that is to say i went on the air in the morning  went off in the sundown because uh that was the way you did it some of them a thousand watt and we 
[02:26:00]  had to gain our audience back every morning and we had a 52 hooper in a nine station market a 52  percent share of the audience in a nine station a hot radio markets report they had a big cbs station  with louisiana hayride had a lot of great radio stations and uh we we were number one but yeah uh we  had an owner who who hated rock and roll but he played it but he also played ray anthony and stuff  like that so it's schizophrenic yeah you could choose everything you wanted you know you had 30  top 30 you had the newcomers and then you had oldies and dusty discs and all that but it was up to you 
[02:26:30]  you know you can make you would pick it and then what about like talking between the records get some  of your personality in there it wasn't just time and temperature and label an artist right it was you  talk about whatever you felt like and you could play around i used to all any live spots i always  had fun with them i would do them in foreign accents or i would do them as characters you know so  yeah it was a lot of freedom yeah now yeah it's it's a bit it's a business which uh yeah i think 
[02:27:00]  ope says it uh a lot when when he got into it even uh you know it's a bunch of guys just kind of  hanging out especially fm radio fm radio they hired you because it because you smoked pot  no i'm serious in the like the album oriented rock stations in the uh the 70s especially they  hired you because you were one of the guys and you would smoke pot and play whatever the hell you  wanted and and then someone decided figured out whoa we can make money off this that's right which 
[02:27:30]  uh turned out to be a bad thing in the end they called it underground radio for sure it was  underground radio radio i used to listen to old air checks and you hear these guys they're  completely stoned looking out looking out the i mean you hear it on the radio they're like i'm just  watching the snowfall they're just completely gone and and and this was cmf i got to listen to some  old air checks and fast forward a mere 10 15 years and there's consultants and there's pds running in 
[02:28:00]  and the general managers and it's a whole different you know ballgame now we test everything and they  send out hooks yeah they actually have people listen to hooks yeah to see which hooks they don't  bother with the whole record you like this little section okay that's a good one yeah if you like  two seconds of this song our station's gonna play it how ridiculous is that and i was one of the guys  my first start on radio i was the guy that had to play this little hook for people at home while  they were trying to eat you did that i was i was an intern that was my job yeah and i would just 
[02:28:30]  fudge the results because half these people would be cursing me out saying f you i'm eating  don't ever call again i'm like all right they like the song yes right on the air so you know and the  consultants would take all this research seriously but they would give it to interns to do of course  they're not going to you know work that hard at uh doing that well it's it's just it's just another  sign of the absolute disintegration and decay of this country it's been in its death throes you know  since world war ii it's on the way it's going away man people think it's good it's going away 
[02:29:00]  if you can't smell that if you can't see that you ain't paying attention man you've said a lot of  things have been really controversial with some people and that's that's one of them uh i happen  to agree with you yeah i think we're doomed as a nation we're going to go down in history as one of  those uh empires that kind of peaked and then kind of went away overreached yeah selfish arrogant  ah and have and now we have things like uh tequila lollipops you know and i counted i would in the 
[02:29:30]  in the car wash about a year a couple of years ago by now i counted of all the ways you could  change the smell in your car from things you hang on the window to beads to sprays to they had several  delivery systems for this stuff i counted over 200 different things you could do to change the smell  in your car and one of them was called new car smell and i mean it's over it's finished take a look 
[02:30:00]  you know one of my favorite things is like as the years have gone on you're you're less good at  hiding your revulsion for everything which is is what's so it's great thank you i love it as it's  gone on uh it's just gotten like just angrier and just yeah less trying to be polite to them and just  assaulting the people that are actually sitting and you know i want to just if i may for a moment  correct the word anger even though it's an understandable word to use when you describe 
[02:30:30]  some of that stuff i do it's really a disappointment and a disillusionment and a contempt for  people this country and our and the human species either one you want to take the american nation  or the human species we were given great gifts this this mind this brain that we have these uh as  humans and the wonderful gifts in this country and we have squandered them made all the wrong  choices organized ourselves poorly ourselves poorly we we believe there's an invisible man in the sky  who's running things and and all we want is the latest gizmo we want a cell phone that'll make 
[02:31:00]  pancakes if we can get that we're going to be fine and it's just absurd and what it is it's if it's  frustration you know it's not an anger it's you intensify it on stage and it reads as anger i know  that but i don't live an angry life and and i look at this and it's an amusement to me this big world  this big round globe is theater in the round to me i'm just here for the show and you got an outlet  you could go on a stage and kind of yeah spew what you're seeing out there and we have an outlet we get 
[02:31:30]  to do a radio show and we point out a lot of stuff that's going on immediacy going for you you can get  right on it the next day i think i would go insane if i wasn't able to just like go on the radio and  talk about all the craziness that's happening around us i really do we we were talking about  the news and how it is just deteriorated from you know when when i was growing up as a kid you'd see  uh walter cronkite on the news it was a desk it was a clock it was walter and you you pretty much 
[02:32:00]  you you pretty much believed him you know what he was saying you you felt he wasn't trying to pull  something over on you whether he was getting accurate information or not he was just reporting  the news he never got up and danced i never saw him get up and dance he never needed flashy graphics  and he never teased what was coming up next with some kind of deadly disease or or uh there's a toy  in your house that could kill your child we'll tell you about it in four hours as your kid plays with 
[02:32:30]  toys it's just this thing this business to get people to tune in and keep tuning in yeah it's  an entertainment show now i once heard a seven o'clock news uh tease that said a prominent  senator no it was during the entertainment hours it was during prime time like 8 30 something like  that they said prominent senator dies find out who at 11. you know i i wrote it down it was so  right right yeah hey uh you know we have to play some of these news teases for george i think you 
[02:33:00]  would really appreciate it oh a couple of the hall of fame ones that we picked we make fun of the local  news and they're news teases right george and uh you might want to put the headphones on so you can  hear this or put them close to you there whatever you want to do i'm not going to tell george carlin  what to do but tell me what to do yeah uh but what we do is we collect all the news teases that come  into our show and then we make a hall of fame oh the best of the best so far okay we've only been doing  this about two years and we i think we got like six we'll play a couple for you like like this one  one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three block area problem is it could be right 
[02:33:30]  next to your house all the sex offenders three block area right next door to you right next door to  you small city right that's fantastic and who wants who's running on that platform yeah like who  wants to do that we will have the sex offenders every one of them one three block area that's  great then you got this one how a twist on the predator law could shut down religion 
[02:34:00]  you let's hope so yeah please but just one little twist and that's it for religion that's it that's  all it's gonna take after all these years right complete anarchy could frequent hiccups be a sign  of cancer watch news 8 and 10 that's on the money it's always that fear of your health and the music  they got that that's the exorcist music yeah is it like playing underneath it sounds exactly like 
[02:34:30]  tubular bells or something playing under there we can't get enough of this george here's uh here's  another one are you normal thursday at 11 on news 8 are you normal don't go by us what a set on these  doesn't that sound like something from kentucky fried movie or snl but it's really the news yeah  we only got a couple more real fast could your house be making you fat tomorrow cbs two news at five  we collect these like baseball cards they are just too much fun to own and we take it very seriously 
[02:35:00]  we debated on the air should this one be in the hall of fame we're not sure yes you know it it takes  a lot to get to the hall of fame and the ingredients in shampoo that can make a boy develop breasts  give it to the girl send them to the neighborhood with the sex predators uh  might as well play it out we got two more this one go go yeah sex offenders may be in your house  in your house especially if you're one right and then finally the problem solvers have uncovered 
[02:35:30]  sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes do you really know who's living down the hall  could this happen to your mother just the thought you sure they're not making fun of themselves they  gotta be at this point just the thought of your mother being ravaged that's pretty much what they  wanted you to get your mom's laying in a nursing home barely breathing and being ravaged by some  predator by some predator that you didn't know about in the uh that's what a great project when did 
[02:36:00]  it happen it's like and and and i talk about the downfall of the the society the whole time i i'm  constantly saying we're doomed we're doomed but i don't know what did it is it the the nation as a  whole with uh getting greedy is it just the leadership is it a political correctness uh the world just  opening up and getting more info you know used to be kind of us against the soviets but then when  when information started being spread a little more easily they they kind of figured out what was 
[02:36:30]  going on i don't know no but it's it's just it is depressing and just disappointing it's kind of  entertaining when you look at you know you when you're born in the world you're given um a ticket  to the freak show when you're born in america you're given a front row seat and some of us have  notebooks and that's as simple as that you and all of us in this room we have notebooks and we make  little no other well some of the freaks are self-appointed michael jackson mike tyson certain 
[02:37:00]  ones and other ones are thrust into it leona helmsley you know uh it's just an interesting thing to watch  that i mean from the standpoint of personalities alone but i i don't know what i i think it's a  cascade you know yeah it builds on itself and they say hey as you say it reminds me of a line from um  fireside theater hey we can make whiskey you know hey we can make money like you said of it that  once they find out there's an extra dollar or two to be squeezed out they do it yeah you have this 
[02:37:30]  great i'm sorry george you have a great knack of of taking the way people are thinking and just  really making you doubt your own point of view like with voting it's such a brilliant point you  made about how people say ah you can't complain if you don't vote and then you point out how like  the people that voted are the ones that put these people in office so you have every right to complain  because you're not a part of it you stayed home that day well of course i'm complaining i didn't  do this it wasn't my work the greatest the greatest ability to narrow everything down to one simple  beautiful point like anorexia i i think it's probably my favorite thing you've ever said is 
[02:38:00]  anorexia rich seas don't want to eat f them yeah i mean what a beautiful i had a friend in my  neighborhood jack heaney we call him billy heaney he was bill john and um and he had that reductionism  he could do that and i sort of like liked that and i think i must have picked some of that up from him  he had a way of looking at something and really presenting it to you in bare bones and of course he 
[02:38:30]  he went into a different field but i was able to use it in my field you know it's it's just a way  of not not bsing yourself looking at the thing and saying hey wait a minute what is this really  oh yeah here's what they're doing you know when it stand up becomes so likable oriented too uh it's  really like annoying how they're focusing so much on people being likable and people being like a sweet  and kind of cuddly for an audience in what respect where well just like on television it seems like  they just want to take like the balls out of anything oh yeah uh especially stand-up performance 
[02:39:00]  wise well i think everybody's running really scared and i think any any voice that sounds  a little scary to them is is going to be neutralized or uh compromised or or you know  yeah it's just it's it's a it's a it's a it's a stupid if you're talking about commercial television  forget it commercial anything i mean that's all that's all it's about is selling goods  there's all that other stuff nothing the stuff in between doesn't mean anything it's just a delivery 
[02:39:30]  system for sales and uh and and you're not going to get anything worthwhile in between the selling  you've you've been uh linked to the um fcc now i mean forever you will be forever uh linked with the  seven dirty words and uh which is now 700 but it's gone it's gone so far beyond that now because now  we don't only have to adhere to fcc regulations we have to adhere to nice regulations we have to 
[02:40:00]  it's political correct uh little interest groups that'll uh like reverend al sharpton and and and  people that will just uh fire off some letterhead to your boss and they will then give you another  list of words that you can no longer use uh on the air uh this disgusts me sure it it it completely  uh takes the it takes your your your balls away you can't do the show you want to do no once  advertising is involved once the cash register comes into play everything else is subordinated to that 
[02:40:30]  and has to be unfortunately that's that's just what they do but i i just think it doesn't it it would  never pan out to where the advertiser really would have to worry like like you say something on the  air uh a group comes up and says all right we're gonna boycott i would love for someone to go go ahead  let me see if this affects you know coca-cola's bottom line at the end of the year let's let's see 
[02:41:00]  how far this yeah let's see how far this really would yeah but they get so scared we're talking about  the imus situation obviously like you know when you do a radio show you follow the fcc guidelines  you have to or you're gonna get fired and get the the company fine but now like aunt said it's not  about that anymore you have to now be nice on the radio you can't offend you can't offend a rutgers  basketball player woman's basketball player people think they have a right to not have their feelings  hurt i know they actually think that's a given right that the forefathers wrote in that said 
[02:41:30]  your feelings um they can't be hurt right and that is you you could say whatever you want as far as  hurting someone's feelings they could come back at you and say something else but that's that left  wing paternalism big big white oh yeah big white daddy knows best uh yep that came you know everyone  we all got to understand that we could expect censorship from the right wing over time we 
[02:42:00]  know that's where that's where it's going to come from but to expect it from the left wing from the  from the politically correct people in the campuses especially the eastern ivy league campuses um that  that that caught me by surprise i mean isn't that the guy the guys the people you grew up with that  we're gonna you know really change things and and you know had this uh a freer thinking and then it just  turns out to be a bunch of phonies just like you said paternalistic the conservatives have always 
[02:42:30]  hid behind like uh family values and religion and it seems like what the liberals hide behind is things  like hate speech like that's how they get you to kind of not say what kind of smashes their ideology  yeah it's this this country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall now it's just you know  we're waiting for the for the big bang to have and it's so wonderful what nature is doing to smack us  back this this this arrogant species who overbuilds overreaches overuses wastes just completely lays 
[02:43:00]  waste and despoils everything it touches three-wheel vehicles all-terrain vehicles we're going to go  everywhere there's some sand we're going to make a mark and we're going to make an ugly mark and then  we're going to not worry about it we're going to come home and we're going to barbecue you know it  should it's just a sick sick it's disgust in my voice you're hearing  you had a great take on the beheadings everybody's like oh how horrible they are and you said the 
[02:43:30]  beheadings when you said f them stay out of another man's country jack i'm like god damn it  that was a good point you don't go to iraq you don't get beheaded so now you know that put that  on your list of stuff stuff not to do yeah what a great thing to say though again boiling it right  down to the simplest of things that's why when i hear you say something like the big invisible  thing in the sky that people well we did a whole bid yesterday uh you know the harry potter books being 
[02:44:00]  banned because there's wizardry and it's not good for the kids and then and then jimmy made a  brilliant observation about you know our own jesus christ there and the wizardry that was involved  with that story that was quite similar to some of the stuff you're reading in these harry potter books  yes yeah walking on water changing water to wine healing people it's wizardry lazarus yeah you know  you're not dead i'm doing a bunch of stuff you're going to like in this next hbo show  the final uh part the last 12 i don't know how long it is really is a series of things on civic 
[02:44:30]  customs and civic beliefs and slogans and things that i question and that i i never have believed in  that i but but basically i'm talking about questioning them i'm not trying to reject them  outright i'm holding them up for question um proud to be an american uh god bless america uh swearing on  the bible taking off your hat when the flag passes by um uh the last one is uh rights the fact that 
[02:45:00]  you really don't have rights you know they're imaginary rights are an idea they're like the  three little pigs they're like pinocchio or the boogeyman we made them up we made that up you know  we have 10 rights in the bill of rights in this country britain has 13 why is god changing numbers  on people the germans have 26 the swedish have 29 i have six the belgians have 29 why would god give  different people in different countries different numbers of different rights so that's again it's 
[02:45:30]  that reduction to the obvious you know and it's it's a wonder i i just love when i get to that part  of the show because i know i'm going to have a lot more fun even than what has come before you know  well i walked in and i and i saw george in the in the green room and i went my favorite thing he's  ever done is you are all diseased it's just just to me i can't stop watching it and you close a live  hbo special and you close on a bit how there's no god and you say that at the end of the joke like  the bit's very funny and at the very end you're like there is no god never was not one i'm like what 
[02:46:00]  balls close a live hbo special saying that and i think i said and if there is a god may he strike  this audience day and i put it on myself and i said see you know he's afraid he don't want to  kill me or whatever it was it was it was such a great great way it's a lot of fun to throw it  down in front of them and then step across it you know hey george can we uh continue with you or you  got a place to please continue with me it's the worst of the open entry show hey let's get right back 
[02:46:30]  to it we got george carlin in studio we don't want to waste a minute with george can i say one of my  favorite things uh is that i was just thinking in the break you've never become pompous as a comedian  like like i love so much the fact that your subject matter i mean it's it's by far the most brilliant  uh social commentary any comics doing but then there's also like silly things and fart jokes  it's never become too hip for the room um it's just whatever is funny to you yeah the room was  never hip anyway the room was always lame i was always hipper than the room even when i was a kid 
[02:47:00]  yeah yeah george could go real deep and real silly like yeah your whole thing on moving and stuff and  yeah that whole i love that there were three areas actually four areas now that i kind of draw from  language itself just for its own sake talking about words and phrases and stuff um words hurt george  we had to read a pamphlet here to do our radio show a whole pamphlet  uh i didn't mean to interrupt you but you just brought up something that i'm just i think you 
[02:47:30]  would appreciate i think you would appreciate this that's why i jumped in here yeah we uh with the  political correctness and stuff yes they handed out this pamphlet about how words hurt called words  hurt and we had to read different stereotypes and how they're used and we shouldn't use them and  that you know we're at a point now on regular radio where i can't go into chinatown and speak to  somebody and then convey the conversation here using the accent of the asian gentleman because  an asian group will write in and say i'm doing a stereotypical accent no i'm i'm imitating the guy 
[02:48:00]  at the store i was at yeah you know you can't say that so i could go i could go to any other store and  go yeah i was talking to a salesman and he said well that uh shirt uh looks a little big on you  that's right i can do that but i can't talk about how the uh egg foo young isn't done yet right so  so this words hurt it was the pamphlet we read every word on the air really yeah and made a huge  joke out of it and then we get in trouble for making a joke out of it we're like you're gonna  drive us insane we can't take this stuff seriously in in in what we're doing on on our radio show 
[02:48:30]  words have become so um yeah so empowered people have become very very nervous where are the four  places you draw from though uh well english language um social commentary kind of i think  that's the best word for some of that stuff because it's not political really more like social  and um silliness you know uh and um observations you know like about stuff things things that 
[02:49:00]  universalities things we all know and uh and therefore you have half the job is done with the  audience because they already know the premise and all you have to do is kind of like then  take care of business i think i started throwing stuff away after uh listening to your stuff bit  like you know we just collect stuff that just means it's it's nonsense well there's an interesting  thing about something that someone gives you um you know you you it's very hard like a year after 
[02:49:30]  your aunt gave you a bad looking clock or a dumb thing for a lamp a year later two years later  ten years later it's really easy to be in storage and say get that out that goes in the big pile over  on the left that's going to salvation army or goodwill or whatever but you you know what's  really hard to do throw it away the same day she gave it and it's the same clock and you feel the same  way about it but your conscience won't let you take it and put it in the dumpster when she leaves the 
[02:50:00]  house it's very interesting enough time has to pass and then you feel okay i can throw this away now  you're so right that's really right throw it out with the gift wrapping still on it that's right  yeah say or try just watch it meet me in the back meet me back by the garbage cans when you get to  the house because i got on it to make it easy for both of us i throw stuff away now and people get  outraged like you just got that for your birthday my god they they will never know that i just threw  their stuff out i'm not i'm not going through maybe that's where they're getting this stuff yeah going  through the dumpsters what you know what is it about just the passage of time that makes certain 
[02:50:30]  things okay when immediately it's just not i was brought up the um the titanic you know being just  a horrific thing a ship sinks kills thousands they sing and then yeah you fast forward a few years  relatively speaking a blink of an eye and there's a an inflatable ride at kids parties that is shaped  like the titanic sinking into the lawn with a hose and little kids slide down the deck and it's like 
[02:51:00]  now it's a ride and they give you some smokestacks too so the kids could bounce yeah they could bounce  off the smokestacks and you're like this was a horrible tragedy where people died in horrifically  painful ways but enough time goes by and it's a kiddie ride now and they wonder why it's all ending  yeah what's wrong with our country that's why uh after 9 11 uh i i brought up that same thing i go 
[02:51:30]  how my how much time has to pass before they have a ride based on that horrific disaster and uh then  people call up hey hey hey what do you say you're sick well the titanic come on you don't think those  people had family friends loved ones that and now it's a kiddie ride enough time goes by people just  seem to want to forget and it's all different people yeah yeah all different people and i've  i've also found that um it's okay to show dead people if they're far away yeah or if it's old 
[02:52:00]  in black and white like old world war ii stuff it's fine you could show japanese people just burnt to a  crisp from flamethrower um and you can show dead people now as long as they're a certain uh a few  a few miles away yeah you can't show them here like they won't show american dead people  in a car wreck or shooting the newscast tells me uh you you you may this coming the footage we're  going to show may be too graphic for you yeah and i you know and i think not for me 
[02:52:30]  what else do you have in there you must have some more i start show me the raw feed i start licking  my chops all right i know you're lying where's the raw feed i don't like that's an edit and i you know  something else i don't like when these local newscasters say there's a woman in los angeles  and she said after any accident or most accidents the ones that follow the description i'm going to  say right now she'll say well thank goodness no one was hurt and i don't agree with that i don't like 
[02:53:00]  that's an editorial remark save that for the editorial page maybe it's it's good some people  got hurt maybe there are people who deserve to be hurt you know maybe we should have more people  hurt well how who is she to decide this for me yeah tell me what happened lady that's right i want to  know that's why i tuned in here i'll say thank goodness they weren't hurt or good for him right i hope  he's dead yeah they might be horrific people yeah i like getting carlin reports like once in a while 
[02:53:30]  you'll see like a comic that will go to see you as you're working through the special it's always  funny to hear like the things that cause certain people to walk out of the room and occasionally  over the years i've gotten them from people like yeah he was doing this thing on abortion and some  woman screamed f you george and walked out it's funny to know like even you and as who you are you're  still getting this crap on the road occasionally it's funny that people will buy a ticket who only saw  you on the johnny carson show in the 1980s or 60s or 70s or something yeah there there are people who 
[02:54:00]  that's why i i really don't like las vegas audiences i go there for for sound reasons for my own um travel  unless my markets kind of breathe a little you know i go out 80 90 dates a year that's a lot of every two  years i go out to a place and so i like to let them breathe and i go to vegas to earn some money and  um i've always told those audiences saying there's three kinds of people here tonight i come out and  i'd say this in the beginning we have three kinds of people we have we have hardcore fans the kind of 
[02:54:30]  people and some of them cheer when you do that hardcore fans the kind of people that'll drive from  buffalo to cleveland to see your show they're fine i said then you have casual fans people who've seen  you a few times and they saw you in college in the 70s and they've heard a couple of your albums and  they're okay with you but they don't really know what it is you do i said and then there are the  schmucks there are the schmucks and the a-holes i say these are the people who uh one of them is 
[02:55:00]  from thailand i'm sorry thai people one of them is from thailand the other guy has on short pants and  and and socks and is scratching his nuts and he has a coupon and these people if these people are  sitting near you don't be influenced by their reactions please you know i i used to give them a  great little about five minute pep talk because you couldn't trust those audiences they go either  way on you aren't they dumb but isn't it there's nothing more aggravating on stage bombing is  acceptable but when you know you're bombing on content because they object to the content like 
[02:55:30]  oh there's nothing that drives jimmy nuts i i would rather just get stared at i respect them  staring but i hate when they try to throw their just it's like an acting job for the rest of the  audience yeah yeah yeah no and i don't know why they go out i don't know why they go out  to aggravate you it should be open if you go into a theater of any kind should be open you should  be there for wonderment and a new experience and surprises yeah that's right things like that not  not oh oh i have to leave i can't even be in the same room as it's like you're physically beating 
[02:56:00]  them they can't take the audio that is going into their ears it freaks them out too much what kind of  friggin close-minded ass leaves a room because they're hearing something that yeah they they  don't really like let's go to the phones a lot of people really experience it really want to talk  to george chrissy and jersey what's up we got george carlin in studio hi i just wanted to say that i love  the f word the shit that he does about the f word thank you i am obsessed with it it's the probably 
[02:56:30]  the funniest thing that i've ever seen in my life and i every time like i have a couple of friends over  i showed the skit to him and it's probably by far the funniest thing that i've ever seen in my life  i love it you sound like a nice group thank you very very much chrissy what what's that about there  george just for the people i think she's talking about the f please uh no i'm sorry chrissy the f  word she said yeah you just do a whole thing on it yeah different uh yeah it's always funny 
[02:57:00]  variations in usage you attack the baby boomers i don't think anything makes me happier than when  you really slug the baby boomers it's just such an accurate yeah awful and i'll have them in the  audience they're such pigs and it's not just a demographic thing it's a certain type of boomer  it's i mean some guy in rural minnesota who's of that you know age group obviously doesn't fit the  description but the stereotypical baby boomer who was you know all in favor of free love and peace and  and and screw authority who became a banker you know and now is kicking people out of homes and shit 
[02:57:30]  you know what i like i like that uh commercial the retirement commercial now with um oh who the  hell is in it ah uh yeah yeah yeah um the guy was an easy rider yeah oh fonda hopper no dennis  hopper oh hopper thank you dennis hopper is trying to be like cool man and he's but he's talking about  your retirement plan man and how you got to go keyword is dream yeah yeah they think if they say that 
[02:58:00]  that gets him in the door all the way right right your dreams didn't die man yeah your dreams  don't retire man come on man and and you're like wait a minute this this is the guy who was smoking  pot and yeah a wild man you should have that then pan to an old lady being beaten by a black orderly  by the way uh during the break you were talking to george about uh you know just going about your  life and seeing stuff and going wow this is why the rest of the world hates us yeah yeah and and i'm 
[02:58:30]  one that like i just kind of skip through life with my shoelaces untied i know i kind of have a good  time i like having fun you enjoy sucking up all our energy and i i drive a enjoy big cars disgusting  gas guzzler i have a sports car that even uses more gas i don't care i really don't care i'm on a  roller coaster ride and i could give a crap if the sun exploded tomorrow i'd actually feel better  about it because i'd get to watch absolutely true you know that's how i feel that's how i feel about 
[02:59:00]  the whole thing but i do understand watching television shows and seeing things that happen  around at least i know what i'm doing uh i see why we're hated by the rest of the world it's it's  some of this reality programming uh things like like you bring up anorexia uh the news you just  watch certain things and go you know we have no clue how like france and spain uh other countries  are looking at us and just going oh malignant narcissism americans what's that malignant 
[02:59:30]  narcissism that's what we were guilty of we're narcissists we see our own reflection and we were  entranced by it well we were the big you know we were the big kahuna on the block for quite a while  and we were pretty much the world's saviors uh keeping everyone safe from the dreaded commies  for so long you can get into the details of a lot of that well i'm talking about perception here you 
[03:00:00]  know it's it's as far as uh especially americans go uh we were raised thinking oh my god these awful  communists are here uh they're taking over the world and we're the good guys so when that whole thing  came down uh we ended up with no one to really uh have as an enemy right and i think we really  started turning on ourselves yeah then we found then we found the uh the moslem religion to turn  on yeah yeah well win by the way i say that in some of my shows yeah yeah the moslems are going to win 
[03:00:30]  because they're going to out reproduce us they're already doing that they will definitely have more  babies than we do and they don't care you see they have nothing to lose i learned very early  growing up in west harlem you don't necessarily if you have to you have to but if you don't necessarily  get into a fight with some guy who doesn't give a an f a guy a person who has nothing to lose will  always beat someone who has things at home that he wants to protect always always always always they 
[03:01:00]  don't care they don't care and there's more of them and they're going to be more and more and more  europe is already becoming moslemized that that stuff is over white race is on its way out we don't  even reproduce a replacement rate no we we can we kind of fairly replace ourselves because we actually  think about it sometimes they go can i afford this is this well my career is a little more important  how many kids can i afford you know college costs are so high i guess we could do two i really 
[03:01:30]  wanted five or seven yeah i agree with you because i i yeah because it's it's a long game we look at  it as like this generation yeah right this they're in for the long haul man that's right they're in for  the time is on their side and we're so anxious to look at the next quarterly dividend  they could wait a thousand years folks that some of you are going to be alive to feel the blade  it's going to be wonderful they certainly can wait a few hundred years yeah because especially in 
[03:02:00]  america everything is uh add everything is instant gratification they don't think on that level they're  like we'll take our time here what do we got got some sand you got a little fire going okay man we're  good for another hundred years yeah we'll wait this one out as they're concerned about getting  their latest phone that cooks pancakes like you said that's right yeah and rub your nuts man i thought  the exact same thing i'm like these guys are going to win because they're not about this generation 
[03:02:30]  about getting it done right now right this is a long-term thing doomed we're just doomed you uh you  ever regret going after anything or no like anything you went after that you're like i shouldn't have  no i've never i don't remember ever feeling like that no no i sometimes i wish i had uh done some  things extra you know some some i wish i had thought even harder about something because i hear  people like that so much why didn't i get put more work into that you know that kind of feeling but  nothing on the other direction no good and uh well you're acting kevin smith has put you in a 
[03:03:00]  few movies yeah yeah very entertaining that was it's fun and kevin's a good good dude and it's a lot of  fun but um it's a waste of time because you sit around all day for someone else to tell you  what to do about something another guy wrote right a different guy wrote it one guy wrote it one guy  directed it and you all you do is you just show up and repeat and i'd rather be sitting there writing  stuff and going out and saying hey listen to this you know what do you hear this yeah look like yeah  you don't seem like the kind of guy that wants to just sit around and i started a trailer and 19 and 
[03:03:30]  had real tough good acting coaches in new york good teachers good course you know i really learned  technique and all that acting would have been a great life but that didn't happen and you can't  just say oh i'll do that too in my case you can't yeah guys do it some guys pull it off very well  george carlin's show lasted i think one season was that was that i'm sure it had some was the writing  difficult because of what they were telling you above was it hard to go where you i knew it probably  wouldn't have much of a chance but i was i think i was 55 then and i said to myself you know i've had a 
[03:04:00]  lot of offers from different directions about sitcoms over the years and maybe i ought to at  least give this one shot so i don't say someday gee i should have tried that i mean i hadn't really  turned into as good a writer as that was 15 years ago and i'm a better i didn't know i was a good  writer then i mean i've had three books since that thing failed i'm so glad that show went away when  that guy called me from fox i said thank you thank you so much for doing this because i was afraid 
[03:04:30]  this would drag on for another year and then come to an end you know um we i had a i had a showrunner  creative partner sam simon who was a brilliant uh brilliant brilliant comic talent but famously  disliked by his colleagues in the business and he admits that and he was very difficult for me and i don't  i think the cards were stacked against me i wasn't part of the club you got to be part of that club  that's a hollywood club and you have to work your way into it in certain ways and coming in from the 
[03:05:00]  outside like that uh uh it didn't work and and they didn't back my show fox didn't really back it  so so that's fine but um i wanted to give it a shot i wanted i didn't want to walk away saying i'd  never tried that yeah well that music means that we are ending this side of the show damn it um  we're definitely plug uh george so happy you came in man by the way for the trick-or-treaters  we're we're healthy sally and i are health conscious the kids come to the door they get a b12 shot

[03:11:30]  who came into work one day with what he thought were new pants  it turns out they were really girl capri pants  and also had flowers on them  i i don't like what was written here  he thought they were new pants  well if he bought them new then they were new  maybe he didn't know they were girl pants  but that had to be for like a fat chick 
[03:12:00]  and i don't want to offend anybody by saying that  and then uh  it says here we took him around sirius xm  to have his pants critiqued  i don't know who we is because it wasn't me  so you better listen  we got some uh breaking news  backstage with o and a  oh  and now backstage with o and a  here is primetime sam roberts 
[03:12:30]  i'm primetime sam roberts  and steve c the developmentally disabled executive producer of the opian anthony show  showed up to work wearing effeminate capri shorts  we went to steve to get the scoop  steve what are you wearing  shorts sam  no those are capri shorts  aren't they really i thought they were just shorts  no they go too far past the knees and they're tight  they're effeminate capri shorts  and they're fringed at the bottom  they're fancy  do you ever like look at yourself in the mirror and think 
[03:13:00]  how can i make the guys make fun of me today  um no i actually look in the mirror and go  i have no idea if this has any fashion relevancy whatsoever  then i turn around and i look at my  i have to stop this  we never stop the backstage with o and a bit  we let it play through  yeah  steve is always thinking fashion  and failing miserably every time  oh hell yeah  he doesn't fucking put on capri pants thinking they're just shorts  is he wearing them today  yes 
[03:13:30]  call him in here immediately  i have to see his legs  all right here he comes  oh my god  hold on we'll get  let me get the rest of this backstage  he's wearing mary ann's pants from uh gilligan's island  that's exactly what those are  and he has the skipper's body  before we get him in let's get the rest of this backstage  but he's lying through his teeth  wouldn't see whatsoever  then i turn around and i look at my 15 fiance  and i go who fucking cares what they think  right i could just wear her clothes  no not quite  she actually bought them for me so  she says they're trendy  i have to believe her 
[03:14:00]  yes they're a huge trend in the gay culture right now  are you making that up  no  fair enough  as steve sees mask of heterosexuality slowly slipped away  we went to ona staff members  erock mars  travis and danny  to get their take on steve's pants  i just saw these  you just saw what  these awful shorts  they're great shorts  do you think those are jeans that a straight masculine man would wear  i don't think most gay people would wear those either  hey mars did you see what steve was wearing today 
[03:14:30]  uh i noticed yes  what did you think  well at first i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt  i thought it was uh long shorts until he sat up  and i saw these fuzzy knickers  knickers  yeah i think they call them knickers  travis did you see steve's pants today  i tried yes i did see them  what did you think  i thought they were quite gay  danny did you see what steve was wearing today  yeah  do you think steve purposely wears things that people think are gay 
[03:15:00]  just leave the guy alone man they're they're sexy they're fashionable they're coming back this year  i think they look good  that's weird  i suppose everyone's entitled to their opinions but if steve's pants aren't gay they're certainly heavily bi-curious  it seems the only thing steve does worse than producing a radio show is convincing people he's attracted to women  i'm primetime sam roberts and this has been backstage with o-n-a  wow  oh damn  steve's right outside the door  damn 
[03:15:30]  here comes steve now  i didn't notice these before  okay  steve  yeah steve  you were lying  what  you're always thinking about fashion  i'm always thinking about vanity  i'm a  like i don't know if vanity and fashion  you put those on thinking they were long shorts  and you have no clue what a capri pants is  i don't know what capri pants are  i really don't  i'm just fixing the back  thank you sweetie  everyone knows what a capri pants is  i really i know what long shorts are and i've got a handful of pairs  so you think those are long shorts  yeah  they're not  no  no  not even close  i'll fully admit i'm a vain egocentric prick 
[03:16:00]  but  let me tell you what long shorts are  long shorts are shorts that are long  yet  the leg doesn't taper  they're very baggy and long  okay  like uh  over the weekend  i was wearing long shorts  but so okay  so technically if these were long shorts they should end at the knee  no  they should be big  they are  big around  they are so much thinner  at the end of them  than they are  at like mid thigh  okay  they should just go down  if they go down all one side 
[03:16:30]  those  if you watch  gilligan's island  yeah  marianne  is wearing those exact  same pants  this is not helping  no  these are designer  like long shorts  steve  i don't think  i don't think there's a guy out there that can pull off the capri pants  no  honestly  they are horrendous  they couldn't be gayer if they came with cum splattered on the back  jimmy you don't like them  would you wear those 
[03:17:00]  no  i wouldn't  steve  steve's pants look like something that  sasha baron cohen would wear as bruno  like that's what he would wear  and that's trendy  right  and very gay  i think evan's got the uh the long shorts on today  which  you know  does he  okay so they'd have to go  abercrombie and fitch  kind of baggy  they stay big  let's say  okay so they go just below the knee  yes  those are like  those are considered like  sort of long shorts  they got like cargo pockets on them 
[03:17:30]  they don't get all tight around the knee area  exactly  those are guy pants  yours are very tight everywhere  like  very tight  and  and  and even around the bottom  where they're caprid  hoffman from virginia  you couldn't find caprid  you couldn't find those pants  in the men's section  could you  no i couldn't  but i did find them in the women's  yeah  there they are  and it's the brand that he's wearing too  holy shit  women wear caprid pants  why would they make them in this size though  a lot of women  why are you sweating so profusely 
[03:18:00]  what i sweat all the time  uh  you're sweating like crazy  i always sweat though  no  women are wearing caprid pants like crazy right now  guys not so much  no  a lot of gay guys are  for real  yeah there's a big thing in that  with very  but it's a very gay look  like it's a very effeminate like  i work in the fashion industry  i'm the gayest guy you've ever seen  like a bottom  it's a bottom look  definitely  yeah  thank you sam  very gay  alright i'm on the men's  shorts  alright  and there's nothing that looks like those 
[03:18:30]  the closest thing is right there  but that comes up to  the guy's knees  alright so it's about  it's about two inches below the knee  but in all fairness  no it's not  but in all fairness to steve  they're not  they're not making caprid pants  that big for women  yeah  they're really not  they would be fucking huge  wow  so i don't know if this is funny  i have a feeling it might be  it says uh  and if you are wearing those jeans  hold on hold on  you're wearing 216 dollar shorts  wow  my chick bought them for me 
[03:19:00]  so  jay from huntington  does anyone else picture steve  getting dressed to goodbye horses  why is that funny  it's from uh  silence of the lambs  silence of the lambs  oh  i'm crying over you  oh right right  okay  i knew there was a reason  why that would be funny  you like these capris  would you fuck me  i like these capris  neither would i  i fuck me hard  steve shorts are made by  victoria's secret  ffs  they're true religion  yeah  true religions  not many guys can pull off 
[03:19:30]  the true religion  religion thing  voss wears true religion  yeah exactly  bobby kelly wears them too  doesn't he  yeah  the beacon of masculinity  bobby kelly  eric's got something  getting voss with  a white problem  fucking purse  bobby's sexy point look  eric's going to the mic  thought steve might want to  just complete the outfit  what is that  a lame brian shirt  yeah  nice uh  animal pattern  lame brian shirt  from his glory days  i think  would you wear that  i i have worn it 
[03:20:00]  give me the thing  how are you going to put it on  good  glitter on it  that's right  prove them wrong steve  put on this shirt  oh please i'm already  now tuck your penis  between your legs  i'm already in the hole  look at the pockets  they're like little sweet buttons  steve you don't have to wear  everything your girl buys you  sometimes you gotta say  i can't wear this  yeah my girl buys me stuff  i'm like what are you insane  i can't fucking wear this  my girl brought me  rubbers i won't wear them  sometimes you have to say  you know nice thought 
[03:20:30]  but i'm uh you know  i'm returning this  women don't buy things  it's an old hack point  but oh boy  wow this is  this is sparkly  that's a 3x  that is so gay  fucking hot  i'm kind of um  everyone  get your cameras  everyone noticed your cover  by the way  my girl bought them  but she did  but that doesn't mean  you go on  and wear it to work  the next day  the hole in his story  is that he's like  oh i don't know  i don't know what they are  i don't know what they are  but he knew that they were  designer jeans  oh i know now

[03:28:30]  way too  much about  the gay  lifestyle  well part of  my job is  to keep in  touch with  the cultures  that opie  and anthony  might not  keep in  touch with  that way  this is  a well  informed  radio show  so the  only thing  i'm guilty  of is  doing my  job well  yeah but  you've also  kissed a  bunch of  guys  yeah but  that was  also for  the show  is that  the greatest  gay picture  ever  come on  there's a  fat ass  guy wearing  daisy dukes  up his ass  crack  half the  bottom of  his ass  is hanging  out

[03:31:00]  they really  don't  they really  don't  they don't  like being  interrupted  what  their show  why don't  wait till  they're on  break  get someone  who they  like more  mars  they love  mars  oh yeah  oh yeah  let's get  mars  that's where  men are  from  i'm getting  i'm getting  word  i'm getting  word from  travis  that we heard  from liam  who's the  guest booker  here  and he's  saying that  alq  has already  mentioned steve's  capris on their  show today  no way  whoa 
[03:31:30]  have they really  for real  that's what i'm  hearing  steve is the  gayest  wow steve  they said that  it is not hot  i told you  they're not  in fashion  mars get  in here  mars  mars  mars you're  making friends  with the  alq guys  yes mr  larry flick  larry flick's  all right  he's a friend  of mine  flick  flick  yeah  how's he a  friend of yours  i'm sure they  didn't rhyme  that in  school  so uh 
[03:32:00]  larry flick  is on the  show  yes he is  how do you  know larry  uh he came  through the shop  and uh  someone introduced  me to him  what shop  the engineering  shop  there's an  engineering shop  around this  i thought it was  a gay club  yeah  the shop  going down to the  shop  bunch of men  with no shirts  and shorts  and wrenches  the shop  so what  can we get one  of those guys  in here on the  break just to  talk about  steve's pants  we could try  but the last time  i spoke to him 
[03:32:30]  they were annoyed  with us a little  bit  why  because we had  some thugs  in the corridor  stopping him  from going to  his show  we're trying to  get to know  people that day  sam  sam he weighs  110 pounds  sam's a thug  how much you weigh  sam for real  i weigh 135 pounds  he's a twink  no you don't  alright 130 pounds  you're a twink  he did use that  uh word  thug  let's say hi  to craig  craig  hey what's up guys  hey  yeah this is uh  get some providence  town there's this  thing called 
[03:33:00]  bear week  it would be  perfect  steve  we did  i guess it's  all the  yeah  we did a whole  break on uh  the gay cruise  the gay bear cruise  because they had  all sorts of events  remember all those  crazy events  they had  oh god  look at the bears  oh no  the provincetown  bears  oh look at these  guys  look at steve  yeah  look at steve  look at steve  this guy's just  bears  big beards 
[03:33:30]  and hairy chests  oh god damn  so happy to be  touching each other  these guys  fuck each other  all weekend  oh my god  bunch of man  on man kissing  yes  wow  oh steve  well come on  why are you  ucking lemon party  what's wrong with you  guys  just three old guys 
[03:34:00]  helping each other out  no he's yucky  because he got lost  on the way to that  guy's house  there's supposed to  be four of us  did we ever figure  out who the gayest  guy is in this  picture steve  i don't know  it's definitely  lemon party rules  the guy laying back  getting his dick sucked  and kissing is pretty  gay because but  the guy sucking the  dick is probably the  gayest  but somebody said  that kissing another  guy is gayer than  blowing another guy  maybe  well  the guy laying on  his back if he  wasn't kissing the 
[03:34:30]  other guy he probably  would be the less  less of the dudes as  far as the gay thing  goes  the one guy who's  kissing the gay the  guy on the back and  then he's holding his  chest gingerly  he might be yeah  because the guy's  sucking dick he's  yeah whatever we've  all made mistakes  how do you decide  which one is the  gayest guy in that  picture  we've tried to  distinguish this before  and it's got to be  the kissing hand on  chest guy  i think it might have  been louis ck i think 
[03:35:00]  but i think he had a  brilliant answer for  this one and it was  the guy taking the  picture  no i think that  question was who  would you rather be  in this picture if  you had to be someone  who would you be and  it was the guy taking  the picture i'm  thinking the guy  taking the picture  you know got right  back into that uh  into the action into  the scene he's like  oh i gotta take a  picture of this but  then he jumped back  in i'll bet just one  of them who took  it was probably on  an auto timer i'll  bet you it was the  guy uh sucking the  dick like the other  two were just kissing  and he ran and set 
[03:35:30]  the auto timer and  then just jumped down  and popped that hog  in his mouth and  it went ching hold  on i have it set  that comes over  hall or actually  he said it wrong it  was set for two  hours ago when they  were all wearing  clothes and smiling  they didn't plan on  getting caught  blowing each other  john hall from  boston the siriusxm  engineer shop a bunch  of guys no shirts  flip-flops sexy  capris and making  docking sleeves because  they all got their  foreskin clipped  all right well i don't 
[03:36:00]  know steve yeah yeah  we can't i'm trying  to help figure it out  i know capri look is  a little rough they're  long shorts and just  because your girl buys  it doesn't mean you  have to wear i know  that i always feel bad  but i go look i can't  i know i i can't wear  this i got shit on  hangers in my closet  that i will never take  off the hanger and  it's you know old  clothes that my my  chick bought me years  ago yeah don't let  him get away with the  my girl bought me 
[03:36:30]  thing because he's  over there defending  them talking about how  fashionable they are  and how expensive they  are and how fancy  yeah he likes them  it's not anything to  do with his girl  buying them maybe i'll  just cut two inches  off the off the knee  thing and then  they'll be no because  then that fringe that  they put on for you  will be ruined okay  people buy shirts  every picture of gay  people of uh you  know gay people they  uh they're just  shirtless with their  arms around each  other is he brushing  that guy's nipple with 
[03:37:00]  his um arm around  him yeah i think he's  brushing both  gentlemen's nipples  what a time what a  time they're helped  they're all having  why don't we start  with this sam took  steve and his capri  pants into out queue  the gay channel here  at sirius xm the  guys don't really like  us well they changed  their opinions a little  a little bit yeah  all right and uh how  did it go it went  well they uh were also  not approving of steve's  wardrobe choice really  yeah they thought he  looked like a giant 
[03:37:30]  asshole not in those  words but not in a good  way we got some  highlights steve going  on out queue with his  capri pants and the  question that that began  our last hour was if  you're a big old butch  straight guy why are you  wearing lower petri pants  okay why is it suddenly  1962 when you're on the  dick and dyke show  okay what's up with  that what's what's your  damage heather so he's  here say hello wait what  the fuck's going on they  just call steve a heifer 
[03:38:00]  a heifer shit is funny  so they were talking  about steve yeah they  did before we went they  did a break early this  morning apparently because  they saw steve walking  around near their studio in  his awful capri pants and  so they were trying to  figure out why somebody like  steve would dress in those  pants and that was their  break earlier today all  right all right now we'll  play this audio and the  question that that began  our last hour was if you  were a big old butch  straight guy why are you  wearing lower petri pants 
[03:38:30]  okay why is it suddenly  1962 when you're on the  dick and dyke show okay  what's up with that what's  what's your damage heather  so he's here say hello  introduce yourself to the  kids at home  fucking assholes  you walked in  you walked in  wearing capris  wearing capris  okay i'm wearing  wranglers and i'm the gay  guy in the room but go  ahead for the record this  will be the last day hi  i'm steve i'm the executive 
[03:39:00]  producer of the ob and  anthony show so that's how  the executive producer of  the ob and anthony show  makes his presence felt for  the very first time on  lq how he was introduced  yeah and the gay guys  wearing wranglers yes  great great steve anyone  notice that the gay guy  sounds like a muppet steve  kermit steve explains his  pants when so we go to  get coffee we're minding  when steve said fucking  assholes was he commenting  on what they were doing  when he walked in  yes he meant that as a  fucking verb not an  adjective 
[03:39:30]  so we go to get coffee  we're minding our own bi  business trying to get  back in the room before  christine w stops singing  her song like good old  queen should exactly and  there he is in and  they're homemade okay  capri pants you know why  they're homemade holy  shit did he make these  pants and that's why we  can't find them on the  fucking website no he's  claiming that they were  purchased he's adamant  wait a minute he had his 
[03:40:00]  chick uh hold on a minute  these guys are saying  they're homemade danny's  been looking at the true  uh true religion website  all morning we can't find  the fucking pants steve's  wearing the website has a  similar pair but it is  definitely not the pair he's  wearing it is not the pair  he's wearing yeah his  fiance called their show  and did say that she  bought them  so for what it's worth  so we go to get coffee  we're minding our own bi  business trying to get  back in the room before  christine w stops singing 
[03:40:30]  her song like good old  queen should exactly and  there he is in and they're  homemade okay capri pants  you know why they're  homemade because honestly  we're not supposed to have  capri pants because  honestly boys our size they  don't make them for us but  i got these i these are  these are true religion  like guy shorts or are  they lane bryant did you  buy them at like a fat  woman's store uh no  really let's break it  down i think they were 
[03:41:00]  actually to be completely  honest my uh my fiancee  bought them online your  fiancee yeah you know  i think i learned to  bet oh damn looks like  looks like some radar  went up in that studio  fiancee yeah all right  holy shit he's getting  his ass kicked he thought  he's just gonna go in  there and like the gay  guys are gonna talk about  his fashion oh my god  smashed to bits bought  them online your fiancee 
[03:41:30]  yeah you know i think i  wouldn't have bet keith to  how how long he would  mention his female partner  oh that's all right but  clearly clearly she has her  own plan right now because  she's letting you walk  around like that but that's  another story because  honestly hey nobody gonna  do okay don't worry about  the chicks hitting on your  nose capris baby  maybe they're girls capri  pants that's what we're  thinking that would have to  be a big girl yeah they're  big girls they make plus 
[03:42:00]  size now i'm saying we  can't find these uh capri  pants i'm telling you  danny's still looking we  can't find them i'm looking  on ebay thinking well maybe  they've been discontinued  find them maybe they were on  sale but the the guys  ralke were saying that  they're homemade i think  they're true religion  fucking jeans and and then  they were cut up to look  like capris i hope not but  if they were last seasons  they're probably not going  to be online all right she  brings up a point i love  shopping they continued just 
[03:42:30]  killing steve yeah so at  what point my i guess the  question is at what point do  these become shorts ever or  if i took a scissor above the  knee above the knee above the  knee so if literally i took a  scissor and cut these things  they would become shorts and  then you would be and then  you would be the guy wearing  shorts at work with sam  disagrees with very very tight  shorts well they're not that  tight because honestly keith  should i say it wait let me  say it no package oh  oh the room just got cold 
[03:43:00]  no package oh the gay guys say  steve's got a little dick they  are fucking tearing him apart  did steve punch at all no  did he get any lines in steve  got no lines nothing not one we  all know how good he is at uh  improv improv improv he's the best  oh geez oh you when would these  be shorts i'd like to take the  comedy bit and make it  informational  he did the same thing he does in

[03:49:30]  i saw it on msnbc  i heard it from you on twitter  i just retweeted what i heard  i heard that bobo passed  i uh i know uh as much as we hate him  he did some good stuff for the show  so i figured fuck that kind of sucks i guess  i mean i didn't actually see the msnbc clip  but somebody screen capped  from msnbc so  oh so it's got to be uh  real then  it's the news  sam's literally crying  sam is literally crying  are you still busted up about it  yeah 
[03:50:00]  you do realize that  we've been on the radio  two and a half hours  and we had a lot of funny stuff so far  but you haven't laughed once  at kurt love  he's laughing at kurt love  this fucking creep hasn't laughed once  and now he's crying  he's laughing so hard  over a dumb throwaway line  it is just throwaway  because you're just starting a rumor  about somebody who nobody knows who it is  it's just taking a person  exactly  and this is their whole public identity  like the only thing anybody knows about kurt love  is they've heard his name mentioned in reference to  being bobo's significant other  oh so it's like a it's like a gay friendship 
[03:50:30]  it's no they're dating  kurt love's dating bobo  well they were  they were  like bobo leaves behind kurt love  he leaves behind  he's survived by kurt love  exactly  survived by kurt love  did kurt love try to jump in the coffin at the funeral  he was really emotional  i've heard i don't know  try to get right inside that coffin with bobo  oh yeah  all i know is  was there some type of message  what message  yeah  what are you talking about  there was somebody pretending to be bobo 
[03:51:00]  oh  left a message to kurt love  oh that's cruel  i don't know about this  wait we have the message  oh yeah  wait wait wait let's let's  hold on  so bobo died over the holiday  yes  and he's been in love with kurt love  and kurt love's been in love with him for some time now  and he survived by kurt love  yes  his boyfriend  yes  someone  but now what  played a cruel trick i guess  yeah  and uh imitated bobo  and called him 
[03:51:30]  yes  no he called  yeah he called bobo's lover  kurt love  his former  what did he die of  what  yeah what did bobo die of  i don't know  i just saw the screen cap from msnbc that said he had passed on  why would msnbc pick up that story  i know we're  he's a celebrity  because we're a big radio show i guess  yeah  oh and he's kind of known for the show  yeah  oh okay  i mean remember when he used to call and he would say you know everybody noticed me at the mets game  right  his neighbors recognized him  yeah  so where does the fake bobo come into this  i don't know  someone's just being an asshole 
[03:52:00]  so someone's being an asshole trying to claim that bobo didn't die  yeah  and that msnbc had it wrong  yeah  i'm so confused  i don't know  i don't know  well are they covering on howard show  because i know there was  he has been doing howard show i guess  oh yeah right  that's true  yeah i saw the  that's another one i saw the screen grabs from  see there's the  oh yeah that's real  fuck  breaking news  msnbc screen cap  nation mourning the death of celebrity daniel bobo curlin  radio star  fuck  see if you look in the right corner it says uh msnbc 
[03:52:30]  right it's right there it says it  file photo  that's obviously real  file photo  so at this point  and he's under an umbrella  yes  so at this point i gotta assume that bobo's gone  well why would msnbc report  i mean they report you decide  so does the fake bobo sound like  nation mourning  like how bobo sounded  yeah but i mean you know  bobo impressions are so easy to do  can we hear this  yeah  all right let's let's hear this  sad 
[03:53:00]  oh you want to play it through here  i think he's queuing you  oh this  is this  play it  well i gotta  you gotta start at the beginning  oh  this is uh  kurt love  fake bobo  see i guess kurt love wanted to get back  at the fake bobo  so he decided to put this voicemail left for him on youtube for everybody  oh okay  that makes sense  because this is again bobo's lover  kurt love  right  okay  lover  hello  hello jeff it's me gobo  somebody uh 
[03:53:30]  on ms  someone must have told it  msnbc that lie  that i'm dead  you know damn well i'm not dead  you know damn well  something's wrong  i need a phone number to msnbc  somebody's better get their phone number  because i'm gonna have a word with them  i'm gonna get whoever televised that lie about me  fired  i will go after the person who televised that lie  and believe that lie 
[03:54:00]  ugh  it ain't gonna be pretty  there's gonna be some punching  i'm going after that guy  whoever did this  if it's that asshole cuss bitch jordan  or that fat fuck door that he rock  oh shit  go down  there's gonna be some hurting going on  yeah  i can't find out who did this 
[03:54:30]  right  please call me back  let me get a chance  let me get a chance  then he just moans at the end of the call  just like the real bobo used to do  my favorite part is he goes  i'm gonna have a word with dumb  with dumb  with dumb  it's just draining  they're having a word with dumb  it's draining  it really is 
[03:55:00]  it's draining  that's the only word for it  it is draining  but let's be honest  that's a pretty good impression of bobo  yeah  i'll give it to that guy  that's why i'd upset kurt love so much  he thought the love of his life  was gone forever  and now this impersonator  is just toying with him  yeah  everyone say that's a good bobo  oh well  well  my thoughts do  yeah we'll get like a tribute together  thoughts and prayers  what do you want to give him five minutes 
[03:55:30]  if that  we don't have that much stuff  three minute tribute  hello  eric's got a good 45 seconds  you got 45 seconds eric  yeah let me see if i  oh you know what  we can just play  when he broke characters  the fuchsia  fucking favorite one ever  i wonder if that fake bobo  will call our show  that'll be creepy  i think that would  that would just be insulting  i'd be able to break that guy down  it's morbid  do we have anybody on the phone now  looks like one of those lines is going 
[03:56:00]  do we have anyone on the phone now  no i don't think so  oh  have the audio if you'd like  oh should we do our bobo tribute now  yeah  yeah  this is the bobo tribute  in memoriam  that everyone's been waiting for  especially kurt love  all right  the bobo tribute finally  uh fugitive  can  can i ask you  um  what  what borough of new york do you live in now  no

[03:58:30]  no it really is  it really is me  phobo  it can't be you because msnbc  uh reported bobo's death  i saw it on the news  i also saw it on cnn and fox news  so  yep  no i saw that  there was nothing there about me  on any of those news  i saw it  we all saw it  were you saying that uh uh  i didn't see it  uh i looked  i looked at every news channel  the wood fake  fake bobo  what are you trying to do here  really

[04:00:00]  apparently uh  before his demise  someone told bobo  to wait outside  his house  holding a sign  with his name on it  yeah  and that they were gonna drive by  and take him to the giants game  what  what happened  they told  somebody actually told bobo  yeah  bobo  go outside your house  hold up a sign  that says danny  because his name is daniel  of course  bobo  and uh  we're gonna send a car for you  and that's how the car driver  is gonna recognize you  to pick you up 
[04:00:30]  and take you to the giants game  he stood out there for how long  i don't know  i was too busy mourning  hours  there were hours between tweets  hours on end  and then his  when he finally realized  he wasn't getting picked up  for the game  what did he tweet  you do it  got screwed again  that is the cruelest thing to do  who would do that  i know  it's the cruelest thing  proven once again  they don't get what we do  but  uh fake bobo 
[04:01:00]  why are you calling back  it really is me  right  they feel like  i did get screwed over  that  hold on a minute  who's this uh  also on the line  this is bobo  oh see  it's another guy  doing bobo  see what i'm saying here  people  i'm a real bobo  this guy is lying  well he sounds like bobo  see everyone is trying  to do the fake bobo  now  see he's the fake bobo  i'm the real bobo  yeah i think this guy  sounds better  i am  which one you want to pick  as the new bobo  now that the real bobo  is gone 
[04:01:30]  i am  i'm the real bobo  no i like the other guy  i'm the real bobo  that guy sounds good  yeah i like that guy  i'm the real bobo  this guy is lying  ah see he says that  uh to a t  i'm not lying  nah  phobo's too over the top  yeah  i like this real bobo guy  the other guy's a little  more subtle with his  impression  i would do anything  for the show  ah see  no i know that  what fake bobo

[04:04:00]  anything else you  you want to say before  we say goodbye to you  say the same thing you've been saying  for 20 minutes  go ahead  again  you're alive  repeat it  i really am still alive  right i really am  ah  ah  oh  it's raining  why did i not know you would  how every time does it happen  right and i felt victim to that damn scam last sunday  what kind of dummy stands outside with a sign 
[04:04:30]  waiting for an anonymous person to get them for the giants game  i don't know if i could trust anybody that says they got giant tickets  yeah i mean why why wouldn't you that sounds like a really smart deal that somebody would give away $300 tickets or whatever to some blithering idiot in queens 
[04:05:00]  i don't know if i could even trust my own friends  what friends  oh believe me there's lots of them  oh yeah  yeah there's others  and it's not just any people that listen to this show  all right fake bobo thank you  i can't trust anybody  fake bobo thank you  we gotta move on  yes fake bobo come on  i will admit  i really would do anything for playoff  fake bobo thank you  i will admit that the uh the impression is right on so we'll give you that much today 
[04:05:30]  yes fobo  i really hand it forward  oh fuck  bye  just training  impossible  there's eight more bobo's on the line  it just never changes  his same droning bullshit  just dumb  i don't think you could train him to work at mcdonald's  no  no  no  he would ask every customer for giants playoff tickets 
[04:06:00]  yeah he'll be a burden to whoever has to care for him for the rest of his life  well i mean he's dead though  well that's true  no he says he's alive but  i'm more confused now than when we started  oh  kurt love's okay with this though  no  being his boyfriend and all  boyfriend lover  lover  everything  every you know they are each other's everything  his lover  kurt love  it's just nonsense  no one knows who kurt love is 
[04:06:30]  do you think that's why his name is kurt love  i i don't  yes  yeah  his last name is  zbobo  pretty funny  what a dolt  fuck him  giant's tickets

[04:07:30]  for an audience  he just did it  no just to fuck with him  just to be a dick  how did uh  how'd you get the picture of  him with the sign  he twittered it  because he had to prove to the guy  that he was outside  oh god  oh god  i don't know  i thought it was a good idea  uh yeah  no just kidding  uh  uh  fantastic  we have a video response  what  is there something else here  or is this 
[04:08:00]  or we did the whole thing  no  oh  you haven't done that yet  oh  it was a youtube channel  of course i forgot  what  well  oh  and you're not the only one with a youtube channel  so he has a video response  of course he does  so what  why wouldn't he  the courts of his death  wait so  he's trying to tell the world he's not dead and he made a video  is that what's going on here  Sam  yeah  yeah  okay  god  hi everybody  this is daniel boba curlin  you all know me from the opiate anthony show 
[04:08:30]  all know him  and  i'm in right now  in  nyack  out of all those places  in nyack  out of all places  probably not a place you'd expect to find boba  i just haven't been  not a place you'd expect to find boba  boba boba  i know you  can't even say his name  i know you think it's impossible  but jimmy actually bites his own teeth  yeah  i've never seen  it's mind boggling  he  jimmy  i've never seen a face like  the one jimmy makes  when he's really annoyed  jim's not alone  this video has 4 likes 
[04:09:00]  and 24 dislikes  no one  expect to  fight a boba  what got you jimmy  just the whole  thing  with this  fucking  idiocy  like how he's trying to prove  that he's alive  but he has to sidestep that  and talk about how you might not  expect to find boba  i enjoy him sometimes  well you know what  i expect a boba to be in that  part of the world  yeah  sure why not  i wouldn't expect that either  you wouldn't expect that  no  no  no  no  yeah i mean that's a 
[04:09:30]  car ride away from  queens  i know  so you don't expect him to be a car  ride away  car ride  no  who would expect to fight bobo  yeah  in the next town  you know where i would be surprised  to see him on a college campus  high school graduation  employed  yes  all right well here's uh  the video of him trying to prove to  everyone he's alive i i'm still not  buying it  well places probably not a place 
[04:10:00]  you'd expect to find bobo  but i just haven't been  visiting here  but i'd like to let you guys  all know  there's been rumors around me  that i'm dead  guess what assholes  i ain't dead  i'm alive  i'm alive  well  and that's right  alive  this dummy is still alive  and i'm still about to wreak havoc  and i know there is somebody who made up a lie that i'm dead  if i find out who made up that lie if i find out who it is the name of that person that guy will get his ass kicked and will be sued to the highest extent of the law 
[04:10:30]  i will beat his ass anyway i can beat him on pot i'm allowed to beat him up  anyway i want him to regret he lied about my death  he will regret that lie  i will make sure  and if i have to  i will make sure  if it's possible 
[04:11:00]  i want that guy raped by a black man  jesus  so  how long is this video  whoever believes this lie  oh you paused  okay  i thought it was that  oh no  i know  it looked like it was like another fucking hour  the way sam has it  it looked like it was 40 more minutes  this blithering idiot  babbling and rambling about nothing  self as usual  so i guess  that person  i don't know  whatever 
[04:11:30]  it's all very confusing  yeah  i guess what's not confusing is uh kurt loves his boyfriend  that's the only thing we know for sure  that's we know that for sure  kurt love is just a listener to the show  yeah  who happens to be or he was or he is whether bobo's dead or not i don't even know at this point  yeah  but regardless the love of bobo's life is kurt love and vice versa  and that we know for sure  yes  they have  they have or had  all right  a passionate sexual relationship  oh wow 
[04:12:00]  all right  at least we know that  it's a fact  did he actually say he's gonna reach havoc  okay  yeah reach havoc  i thought i heard that  he's a tall guy  you're gonna be sued to the highest extent of the law  of course  and he's only gonna beat the person to the point  he's fucking like a true lawyer  where it's still legal  did he say  and if possible he'll be raped by a black man  right  yeah if possible  uh according to snopes that video is fake so  oh wow  snopes checking in  yep  dopes  dopes  dopes 
[04:12:30]  and will in houston writes  i think bon jovi handled the death rumor better  my favorite part is looking at jimmy  jimmy's eating his face  i'm just  he's just a fucking idiot  i can't even have mercy on someone who just falls to the same thing every time  every time  every time  you mean if i plunked him down right now 
[04:13:00]  he would he would do the same shit  there's no way  no  fake bobo  yeah this is actual bobo  actual  what do you want to tell the world  no  dummy  what do you want to tell the world  you know what i ain't gonna say  i ain't gonna say anything about this rumor  all right  i already know  i already know it's fake  all right  not according to snopes  yeah snopes is saying that  the video is fake  well  well the thing is i think  what do you want to tell the world  fake bobo  i think i think you 
[04:13:30]  what do you want to tell the world  fake bobo  you as anyone else  all right  that's what we do  just mumbling and not getting to it  what  get to it  oh it drives me  fucking drives me nuts  i i i apologize  oh it's  because you asked him a question  what do you want to say  will you stop fucking starting over  just say it once  it really is a chore  i apologize  because i think i'd do it just to see your reaction 
[04:14:00]  oh it drives me crazy  i think that's all the only reason i do this  because it drives you nuts  oh he's just a idiot  he falls  but every time  he's the worst  oh  god bless  godspeed  godspeed  bobo  daniel bobo  curling  why didn't he take uh kurt love's name  bobo love  or  or was kurt love supposed to take bobo's name 
[04:14:30]  uh kurt love  they switch  they're switch hitters  i've heard  would he do a daniel bobo  curling hyphen love  that would be good  if he hyphenates  ah  and then he would be  kurt love curling  which is true  and his name  yes  all right  it's so inside  yeah  oh no  and that's what makes you laugh  that is so inside  it's so ridiculously inside 
[04:15:00]  and that's  well why does that make you laugh  oh  because it's just like  there's no reason to take  someone as  nondescript as kurt love  and to just drag them through the mud  for no reason  except for your own personal  right  because no one else  no one even knows who he is  everybody just goes  why is he saying kurt love  i don't understand  hey so uh  happy memorial day  and thanks for listening to
