<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with callers sharing risqu√© anecdotes about their sexual experiences, including humorous tales of unexpected encounters and post-coital surprises.  The conversation then took a sharp turn into a highly offensive and graphic satirical portrayal of President Clinton's visit to Vietnam, using racist and violent language.  A caller then confessed to stealing from a Niagara Falls hotel, escalating the story to a fabricated kidnapping of a maid. This was followed by a discussion of Don West's departure from the Home Shopping Network, punctuated by comedic audio clips of West's infamous sales pitches, including one seemingly hawking virgins, and a humorous McDonald's-themed parody.

The show continued with numerous listener calls, many from military personnel recounting embellished stories of near-misses with submarines.  One caller, Rudy, described soiling himself due to a submarine surfacing unexpectedly close to his boat, while another, Wayne, recounted firing artillery over a fishing vessel in Vietnam.  A significant portion was dedicated to comedian Richard Denny, who was initially subjected to prolonged teasing before being allowed into the studio, resulting in further awkward interactions.  A bizarre segment involved "Stalker Patty," a 46-year-old virgin, and Ron Jeremy, who was present in the studio, engaging in a crude game involving a hidden twenty-dollar bill.  This segment included explicit descriptions and numerous crude jokes, culminating in Patty receiving U2 concert tickets and money.  A brief mention of a call about Tom Brokaw's birthday was also included.

A failed attempt to connect with Ronald Reagan on his 90th birthday followed, with the hosts blaming various technical issues and personnel (Rick, Jack, Ken Stevens) for the unsuccessful call.  Opie's impersonation of Reagan was eventually revealed.  This segment was interspersed with comedic bickering between Opie and Anthony, with Anthony making repeated exits to supposedly fix the phone lines.  The show then featured "Jackie the Knife Girl," a stripper with a knife fetish, in the studio.  Rob, a show staffer, engaged in a graphic knife-across-the-body act with Jackie, while other staff members, including Drew Boogie, Jamaken Mike, Big Kevin, and Hot Wax Shannon, were present.  The segment ended with a continuation of the knife act and a song parody about O.J. Simpson.

The show concluded with a phone interview with 92-year-old Buddy Epson, a former actor from *Barnaby Jones* and *The Beverly Hillbillies*, promoting his new book, "Kelly's Quest."  The interview was hampered by technical difficulties with Epson's hearing aids, resulting in frequent interruptions and unclear audio.  Epson shared anecdotes from his career, including his unusual use of the term "carpet muncher," which became a recurring joke.  Audio clips showcasing the deterioration of Epson's voice were played, including his iconic "Well, Doggies" line. The show ended with a discussion of a submarine incident involving a civilian crew and a fishing trawler, marked by further offensive language and racist jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Back there. I have no idea what's back there. I consider myself pretty clean. I try to shower a lot and things like that.  Middle of the summer, I come home. My underwear some days looks like it, like we say, a shoeshine rag, okay?  So, I can't even imagine this, man.  I don't know.  Well, cannot imagine.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, ONA. How's it going?  Pretty good.  I have to agree with that last caller. It is the best feeling in the world.  You're a gay guy, right? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  But you know what? I mean, hello?  Yeah.  But that guy has one thing that, that guy, his girl can't do one thing. I mean, maybe she can, but my boyfriend's always got like a five o'clock shadow going.  It is like, it is like sandpaper, and it is just the most amazing feeling in the world.  Tell me more.  Oh, my God.  Just in case there was a doubt on my sexuality, I just.  Nope, nope, still straight.  Oh, if you hear this one, you know the shocker is when you have your pinky and your index finger? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And that's the shocker?  Right.  There's something called the spocker, which is you do the Vulcan salute, now you have the ring finger and the pinky, and your middle finger and the index finger.  The spocker.  That's from Froy. How do you know that?  My brother tells a great shocker story.  I think you heard it.  The girl woke up with fur all over her body.  Oh, it's a great story. 
[00:01:30]  What, she was hairy?  No, no, no, no, no.  She woke up with fur all over her body.  He needs to tell a story, but he's got a, he's got a big ass black dog that sleeps on his, you know, his bed.  So the bed has a lot of fur.  And after they were done, it was just a sloppy, sloppy mess, and they're rolling around that she had fur all over her.  Like sweat and dog hair.  Nice.  But there's more to it, because he shocked her, and it was funny.  At least then you'd have an excuse when you've got to do that awkward...  No, it's dog hair. 
[00:02:00]  A big, thick, curly dog hair.  He had to do the walk of shame to his bathroom window, mirror, because he knew he was going to do it.  It's a great story.  The walk of shame?  He calls it the walk of shame.  Well, when you're embarrassed about who you're with?  When you know you're going to, you know...  The walk of shame is many things.  You've done the walk of shame, right?  Like you're out all night, and you have sex with a pig.  Right.  And then you have to do the walk of shame, you know, at like 8 in the morning back home. 
[00:02:30]  Your dark clothes, like you're from the nightclub, you're in your dark clothes, you're like three hours of sleep, you reek of booze.  You're just ashamed of yourself.  You know, you just did the wrong thing the night before, and you do the walk of shame home.  Can't look at yourself in the mirror as you're passing by.  Just bad.  Oh, yeah.  You catch a glimpse of yourself through your periphery, and you're just like, you disgust me.  Your roommates are up, getting ready for work, they've got their suits on, and they've got their coffee, and you smell like brew, and you're just a mess, and you don't have a job. 
[00:03:00]  You just did this pig last night.  You're stuck to your underwear.  Yeah.  Isn't that the most painful thing?  You got to take your underwear down.  Ow!  Oh, yeah.  Now I got the sprinkler.  Take me to my happy place, please.  I'm a disgusting mess.  Let me go to Joe.  We're just about done with the tuchus lingus.  Uh, Joe, what's up?  Okay, guys, listen, I'm not gay, but I did have this one girl who used to do, uh, she used to give me oral treats, as you would call it. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  And I'm the kind of guy who, when I'm getting that, I'm very quiet.  I just kind of grab onto whatever I can.  I'm just like, hey, you know, I just...  Enjoy the ride.  Right.  Well, one time, she started moving her way towards the back porch, if you know what I mean, and wham, I started getting it.  And I tell you, at the point of O, I sound like a donkey getting hit by a whiffle ball bat.  I was like, you know, you know, you know, and she had the nerve to ask me, she had the nerve to ask me if I'm all right.  I'm like, you have your meh and my meh. 
[00:04:00]  Pray to God, man.  All right, man, the bag and nuts are always supporting you guys.  See you later.  Thank you, Joe.  The, uh...  Well, that's kind of a shocker.  More of this crap on the way.  All right, we'll take a break, right?  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Man, the president was in Vietnam. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  I saw that on the news.  He's taking this little trip to Vietnam.  And I guess it's some kind of goodwill trip that he's taking.  This, he's just wasting time, you know.  It's so obvious that this guy is, he's out, you know, regardless of who they put in there now.  But that whole debacle looks like it's going to be Bush as early as tomorrow.  Well, we'll see.  Watch.  Watch what happens.  It'll go on and on forever. 
[00:05:00]  But, uh, Clinton now, he would never have done something like this to this extent.  Because, um, he's, he's, you should get bashed for this.  The guy is, uh, is a disgrace.  And the veterans that served in Vietnam ought to, uh, well, they already can't stand him.  But they really should be up in arms now.  Because, uh, what the hell business does he have going over there and shaking these people's hands?  And smiling and laughing with them.  And I was thinking about this.  It's as if, uh, you get a bunch of your friends together, right? 
[00:05:30]  And they're going to fight, uh, with this, uh, bunch of other guys.  And then one of your group of friends runs away from the fight.  And your friends, uh, get their asses kicked.  Then a little while later, you go over to the guys that, that beat up your friends and start shaking hands and smiling.  Taking pictures.  Then your friends look like, they turn around and go, what?  You effing tool.  Does this have something to do with Clinton being a draft dodger?  Hey.  Oh.  You're quick now today.  Look at that. 
[00:06:00]  The big yellow ones.  The sun.  I had the firm and I was going to school.  But now, 30 years later, he steps off Air Force One, uh, and, and now he's in the NOM.  This, ooh, scary.  Wow, look at this.  Ooh, look.  A place selling McDonald's and Coca-Cola.  Petrifying.  Landing in a, oh my God, Air Force One.  It's a hot LV.  Hot LV.  Red smoke.  No, there's nothing going on.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  No, no, you missed all the action, uh, Mr. Clinton. 
[00:06:30]  I got my little radio here.  I'm like the radio man.  Hot.  Zips in the wire.  Hold that parameter.  Snake and ape on my paws.  No, no, none of that's going on anymore.  Goddamn slopes.  No.  Play the music when we come in to, uh, the airport.  No, Air Force One.  Play the music.  Drive the slopes crazy.  See that one running?  Go ahead.  Put the pontoon right up the road.  Yeah.  I'm going to smoke me some weed. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, this is great.  You ever do a shotgun?  I swear, this is great.  Look, we're here in our, uh, our bunker.  Let me just crack the, uh, crack the shotgun for you.  There we go.  Look, now I'm going to blow the smoke in through the, through the magazine.  And you, you just, you just smoke it out of the barrel.  Go ahead.  Hey, this ain't your show, Elias. 
[00:07:30]  This ain't your show.  Look, I'm firing out the door of Air Force One.  Down on the last caddy.  This is like, as no one shoots back.  I'm busted.  Mr. President, how can you shoot innocent women and children? 
[00:08:00]  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  God damn, this is a blast with no one shooting back.  God damn, look at that goop.  I even shoot the water buffaloes.  I don't care.  Whatever it takes.  Leave that goddamn door open.  This is so much fun when I know they can shoot back.  Hey.  That's right. 
[00:08:30]  Psycho Mark's right here with me.  Where's that little, that little napalm slope girl running down the street?  I'll take her out.  You're a little too late.  What?  Mr. President.  What happened?  Where'd everyone go?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Now, the war's over, you idiot.  Smells like victory.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:09:00]  Sorry to talk to me.  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane Bruttenkopf, through her pretty pink panties, are over.  No, no, don't tell me that.  I'm the President.  Hey, look who it is.  Dylan.  God damn.  Come on, everyone goes home.  No one left behind.  No one left behind.  Where's this Charlie I heard about so much?  I love it.  Open up that front door. 
[00:09:30]  Let's go, boys.  Yeah.  Woo.  God, I love this.  Shut up, you dink.  $10 love you long time.  Come here.  Yeah.  I thought that gook had a grenade.  But it was just a Big Mac and a peace offer.  But hell, these things happen in wartime.  Unbelievable. 
[00:10:00]  Go on enough.  No more yanking my cranky.  I love this.  Knee deep in the rice paddy.  Oh, wait.  What's she going for?  Oh, it was just a piece of rice.  Sorry.  Come on, let's do the whole village.  Let's do the whole village.  Holy ass.  You ever see a head come apart like that?  You're a racist. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  30 years late.  I'm in combat.  This is great.  Why did I miss this?  It's so easy.  I don't know what I was so scared of when they told me to report.  And I ran off to England because this is just a piece of cake.  You take your big jet plane.  You fly low.  Look at this.  There's another five.  I just laughed out of it.  Okay. 
[00:11:00]  Groovy.  Why would he pick Vietnam?  He's got two months to waste and he goes over there?  I'm going to call in an airstrike.  Come on, one.  Come on.  Oh, look at that.  It's beautiful, man.  It's beautiful, man.  Unbelievable.  This is alive.  Get the claymores.  Nothing's going on anymore, you idiot.

Jesus, man.  I can't do much.  I can't do much.  I can't do much.  I can't do much.  I can't do much.  Thank you for calling. 
[00:12:00]  This is Tom just speaking.  How may I help you?  I stayed in your hotel in Niagara Falls about a month ago.  I was on my honeymoon and stuff.  And, uh, well, I stole a few items.  And, uh, well, recently I found God and, uh, I'm feeling a little guilty about it.  Um, hold on.  Let me try this for the corporate services.  Okay.  Corporate service group.  My name is Dean and I understand there's a matter of some items from one of our hotels?  Well, I, uh, I stole some items while I was staying at the, in the Niagara Falls region. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  And, uh, I found God recently and I'm, uh, feeling a little guilty about it.  Okay.  Uh, I stole, uh, uh, the bottle of shampoo and conditioner and the free shower cap and hand  lotion.  All right.  And a couple of the towels.  Okay.  As far as, um, the consumables, the shower cap, the, um, shampoo and conditioner, et cetera,  um, those items are for your use and you are free to take those with you if you'd like.  As far as the towels, they do ask that you don't take the towels with you if you'd like  to return.  I can provide the address for the hotel and you can send it to them. 
[00:13:00]  Well, I wish I stopped there, but I didn't.  I also stole the coffee maker and, uh, we were going on a long trip, so I figured I needed  the blankets and pillows.  Okay.  All right.  Those items should be returned to the hotel.  I can offer you that address.  And the sheets, because they got a little messy.  I was embarrassed to leave them behind.  You said you stayed at the sh** in Niagara Falls?  Uh, I, well, I'm a little nervous, so I don't really want to give too much info.  Okay.  At this time.  Well, I don't even have your name, sir, and there are several hundred people that stay 
[00:13:30]  in that hotel a day, and I can provide you that address without ever knowing your name.  Uh.  You can send it to them anonymously.  Well, I also, uh, stole the lamp and the TV remote.  Oh, I'm sure the management would appreciate those items being returned.  And, and the fax machine.  I feel a little better that I'm at least telling somebody about this.  And would you like to return the items to the hotel?  Honestly, I, I still have the, um, would you like that address?  And if so, which hotel was it?  Well, um, if, if I told you, it'd be very obvious, because we also, um, uh, took one 
[00:14:00]  of the courtesy buses on a little joyride.  It wasn't easy to get the ice machine in that, but I, I guess I just needed to tell someone  this.  I, I, I really can't afford to actually replace the items.  Hello?  Yes.  I mean, I could possibly, uh, turn the couch, I guess.  That's still in my living room.  How much do you think all these items would cost?  That I do not know, um, as far as how much an ice machine costs, I do not know.  I can offer you the address of the hotel, and that would offer you an outlet to return the 
[00:14:30]  items you still have.  Um, well, actually, I could use that address, because, uh, Consuelo, the maid, um, she's going  to need to find her way back to the hotel.  Well, I, well, I kidnapped her, and I, I, I let her go today, she was in the basement  for a month.  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Oh, Black Betty, Bama Lam, whoa, Black Betty, Bama Lam, Black Betty had a child, Bama Lam, 
[00:15:00]  the damn thing gone wild, Bama Lam, she said it weren't none of mine, Bama Lam, the damn  thing gone blind, Bama Lam, I said, oh, Black Betty, Bama Lam, whoa, Black Betty, Bama Lam,  whoa, Black Betty, Bama Lam, whoa, Black Betty, Bama Lam, she really gets me high, Bama Lam,  you know that's no lie, Bama Lam, she's so rock-spitty, Bama Lam, man, she's always ready, Bama Lam,  I'm floored here.

[00:27:30]  Now, Buddy, we haven't talked to you in a couple of years.  Great to see.  Well, you're still around.  That's good.  I'm not only around, but I'm still, you know, doing things.  Like, you know, creating something.  I see that.  Last time we talked to you, you were painting.  You're still doing the painting?  Painting?  Yeah.  Are you real?  I feel like I'm not fully connected here.  Yeah, I'm getting that, too. 
[00:28:00]  Are you getting a full voice?  Oh, the sound?  Yes.  How's this?  Is this better, Buddy?  That's a little better, but it seems to cut out when I talk.  How's this, Buddy?  Is that better?  Yeah.  Let me try another hearing aid.  I've got it over here, like, uh...  Yeah, pop another hearing aid in.  Talk to each other for a moment.  All right.  Pop another hearing aid in, Buddy. 
[00:28:30]  Opie, Buddy?  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  There we go.  Opie, um, Buddy's going to try another hearing aid.  Buddy's going to pop in another hearing aid and tell us all about what he's working on now.  Wait a minute.  Oh, what's that?  What, Buddy?  Buddy?  He's just, he's still...  I think he said it'll be another minute.  Hello?  Buddy!  You're there?  Yeah.  Well, that's what happens when, you know, when you're 92, you know, you have to, things happen to you, like, uh, when you see a pretty girl walking by and your pacemaker starts to open the garage door and then, you know, things happen. 
[00:29:00]  Buddy, how many electronics do you have on you?  Any electronics?  Yeah.  What do you got, the hearing aid?  You got a pacemaker?  A pacemaker and a hearing aid.  And that?  But I, you're not cutting out now.  That's not too bad.  Uh, last time we talked to Buddy Epson, he was, um, uh, entering the internet.  Yes, you had the, uh, BuddyEpson.com website?  Oh, yeah.  Well, now we're selling a book on BuddyEpson.com and also on, uh, uh, let's see, uh, First Books. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  FirstBooks.com.  Okay.  And also the, uh, uh, Barnes & Noble, which is a bricks and mortar, uh, bookstore.  Buddy remembers when the wagon used to come around with the books.  A wagon used to come around with the books.  I don't quite remember.  I wasn't in the book business in those days.  Hey, uh, Buddy, what's the name of your book?  Uh, Kelly's Quest.  You know, it's, it's a very strange thing. 
[00:30:00]  Uh, it happened.  I mean, I was in show business for 75 years.  Yes.  I thought I was just, you know, entertaining folks who, uh, uh, but I didn't realize I  was gathering material for a novel.  Yeah, you had enough material for, uh, for a novel.  Sure.  What?  That's kind of...  It happened.  One day I was inspired.  I worked on a set of, uh, Barnaby Jones, and it was very busy as usual, and there were  a bunch of very, very efficient, uh, crew. 
[00:30:30]  There, and there were, among them, there was one girl.  One girl.  And she was beautiful.  Uh-huh.  But she was a stagehand.  I mean, she had, uh, done reason, uh, and, uh, the, uh, the tool belt, and she was doing  her job in such a way that nobody could find fault with her.  Yeah.  And she fascinated me.  And so, I wrote a novel about her.  You, you were all, like, hot on this girl.  I, uh, well, I was just curious.  You were a, you were like a kid of, uh, 65 back then, too, right? 
[00:31:00]  Buddy?  Uh, it's difficult to convince my wife that, uh, I didn't have a romantic.  A threesome.  Hey, buddy, buddy.  Huh?  Uh, did you, uh, wanna, you know, uh, have some of that sex with this Kelly girl?  Well, uh, yeah.  Uh, secondarily, first of all, I was interested in her life.  In her life?  Okay.  Yeah.  And so...  And you don't have to tell us.  ...I put together the rest of her story.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  It turned out to be Kelly's question.  What she is, is looking for a man, uh, she's looking for Mr. Wright.  You know who Mr. Wright is?  Oh.  You know, whatever girl's looking for, a guy that, uh, she would, uh, you know, like her  to be the father of her children.  Now, buddy.  Yeah.  Did that, uh, young, uh, whippersnapper that played, uh, Jedediah Jones?  Uh, where?  I don't know what happened to him.  Did he, uh, get Kelly?  Uh, no, no.  Well, he disappeared.  He sure did. 
[00:32:00]  He's, he's off the scope.  So, I don't know what happened to him.  I try, you know, he has no forwarding address, nothing.  Goddamn, that was a great show.  He disappeared.  Barnaby Jones.  Yeah, can we get a Barnaby Jones line out of you there, buddy?  The what?  Uh, can you say something from, uh, Barnaby Jones for us?  Uh, something from Barnaby Jones.  Yeah, we like when you recite some dialogue from the old show there.  Oh, good evening, ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand yours, but went out to buy the evening paper one night ten years ago, and you want me to  find him, because his supper's getting cold. 
[00:32:30]  You got enough?  That's enough, buddy.  But you know something?  You know what I want to hear?  Now, this is obviously from the classic show, The Beverly Hillbillies, which everyone has  just grown to love you, uh, from, and, uh, I, I gotta hear your famous line.  Here it comes, though.  The well doggy.  Yeah, you want to hear that?  Yeah, let's hear it.  That's two words, you know.  It certainly is.  You ready?  Yeah.  Well doggy. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Buddy, that's it.  There you go.  It's a puppy.  You know, everyone's been waiting for that, buddy.  The what?  Everyone's been waiting, uh, here, uh, you do the well doggy.  Well, I'll tell you what I'm thinking of doing, I'm thinking of putting it on a watch.  On a watch?  And then, like, every hour, it'll go well doggy?  You think it would go well?  You didn't pop a vocal cord, did you?  It did.  No, but my voice is a little off today.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you're busy now.  You got a book out, and, uh, you're doing a lot of press for the book. 
[00:33:30]  Sure.  You're talking a lot.  Can we, can we, can we...  I'm really talking too much.  Hey, can we see, can we hear the well doggy one more time?  Yeah, I'd love that one.  One more time.  If we hear it too much, I'll get tired of it.  No, no, no.  I've been hearing that since, uh, I was a kid.  All right, uh, this is the last time for well doggies, but it's, uh,  there are two of you there, and there's one for each one.  All right.  Here we go.  Well, doggies!  Yeah!  Okay. 
[00:34:00]  Buddy.  Buddy, that's much fun the second time, so I will only do it once.  No, I think that was better than the first one.  Hey, uh, buddy, we're hearing that, um, you have, like, a song parody?  You do a little something to the Beverly Hillbillies theme?  Uh, something from the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  Let me see.  Supposedly he has reworked the song, Anthony.  Oh, really?  You kind of, uh, rewrote some of the words or something?  Oh, uh, come and listen to the story about a man named, uh, 
[00:34:30]  poor Montaner, barely kept his family fed, and, uh, that's it, wasn't it?  And, uh, and then one day, oh, he, uh, but he never, when I, when I, I'm still writing it,  when people, I'm sorry.  Uh, uh, uh, and, uh, you shouldn't have asked me, but that was just, uh, yeah, no, we got, yeah, that's okay.  That's all right.  We were, what the hell?  We were told that, uh, you had, uh, you, you worked up, uh, worked up a little ditty. 
[00:35:00]  Now, buddy.  Yeah.  You remember, um, Miss Hathaway from the...  Miss Hathaway?  Yeah.  I remember.  Now, uh, was she...  Wonderful, wonderful actress.  Yeah, she was, of course.  She was in a lot of, uh, things back in the 60s and, uh, in the 70s and whatnot.  Now, was she, um, you know, you know what I mean, right?  The goers?  I know what you mean.  You know what I mean.  Was she, did she like some of the...  Did she like Kelly also?  Uh, would she have liked Kelly?  Uh, well, I think they would have gotten along. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, huh?  Uh, but, uh, I wouldn't say that, uh...  I think she was a dyke, buddy.  They were not, uh, they were not similar personalities, I would say.  I, I, I'm, I'm guessing Miss Hathaway, carpet muncher.  You know what I mean?  She what?  I'm thinking she was a, uh, carpet muncher.  You know what that is, buddy?  A carpet muncher?  A carpet muncher.  A vegetarian.  You know what I mean?  Uh, you know, kind of into the girls.  I don't know, you're speaking another language. 
[00:36:00]  We are.  Uh, you know, kind of like, uh, into girls more than guys.  Uh.  You know?  She's like digging for the pearl.  I never investigated that possibility, but, uh, um, she was a nice lady and she acted well  and that's all that, that, uh, you know, that's as far as I went in investigating.  Ah, you talked to Max at all?  Max, of course.  What do you mean I've talked to him?  I say, hello, Max, and I now shut up for 20 minutes because he keeps talking.  He doesn't shut up, huh?  Uh, you know, he's a wonderful guy. 
[00:36:30]  Jethro.  I should never have given him a set of dominoes for Christmas.  Dominoes?  Yeah, he just saw them in an absinthe roll and look what happened.  He's just building a, some kind of a gambling casino.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  A Jethro gambling casino?  Yeah.  Uncle Jed, Uncle Jed, I'm going to make me a casino.  I can see it.  It sounds like one of his little schemes that he was always trying to do.  I'm going to be a double-naught spy.  It's one of my favorites.  Yeah, I can see you're fans of his, and it's improperly, so he's a wonderful guy. 
[00:37:00]  Well, let me tell you, a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillies.  I always enjoyed that.  And now you're a novelist, which, you know, 92 years old.  And it depends on how many people buy the book.  So I want you guys to get busy and plug it, please.  I'm going to go out on the street with a cart and sell it myself, buddy.  Stay right on the machine there.  The machine.  You can get Buddy's book through his website, buddyepsin.com.  Is there anything else on the website, Buddy?  I don't know. 
[00:37:30]  You might find some other stuff on there.  But any of that?  The book is the thing that I want to plug right now.  All right.  There's none of that porno on your website?  No.  There's no porno on there.  Porno is a thing of the past.  You have to get to the real story now that I got on Kelly's Quest.  All right.  Very good.  Buddy Epson, thank you so much for coming on the air with us again.  You're very welcome, and I enjoyed it.  Thank you.  And we look forward to talking to you again.  Bye. 
[00:38:00]  Thank you, buddy.  Anytime.  Thanks, buddy.  Right.  Bye.  All right.  The great Buddy Epson.  There goes Buddy Epson.  He's a novelist.  Go to BuddyEpson.com.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You know, I thought last time we talked to him was a little, you know, rough.  Well, now we've got to compare.  Well, Rick, can you, Rick, please get those two.  Also, isolate the clip of him saying carpet muncher because that is carpet muncher.  When he said that, carpet muncher, he goes, carpet muncher. 
[00:38:30]  What is a carpet muncher?  I think we found a new sound.  Hey, carpet muncher.  Poor Buddy.  Well, you know something?  If you could even do that at 92.  God bless him.  And write a book and whatnot.  God bless him.  What not.  Definitely.  Him trying to sing the song.  How uncomfortable was everybody?  It was Prince Radio at his best.  I was trying to shut up, but then when it got silent, I had to jump in and say something.  I was like, well, I'm really uncomfortable here, buddy. 
[00:39:00]  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's going on?  Congratulations, boys.  I'm getting the last interview with Buddy.  No.  Stop it.  I had to hang up on Pete.  Stop it.  That's not nice.  Come on.  He's fine.  We said that last time, and that was two years ago.  He's still kicking.  Jay, what's going on?  Guys, you guys have to be careful.  I think that's considered elder abuse.  I'm not too sure.  We were very nice to Buddy Epstein.  Well, you know, and Buddy's publicist told us that he sings a good version of the theme  song.  I don't know who the publicist was thinking about. 
[00:39:30]  Maybe back in 1974.  I don't know why.  He specifically wrote it in a note when he sent the book over.  He says, hey, Buddy has this great parody that he does to Beverly Hillbillies.  Have him sing it.  He does it all the time.  Well, he's got two and a half lines out, and he goes, I'm still writing it.  Other part of that was the thing, and then he's listening to us.  Well, I wish you didn't ask me that.  Oh, boy, Buddy. 
[00:40:00]  We leave you with the sounds of Buddy Epson.  Buddy used to be very healthy and vibrant.  Heard his voice.  Sounded just like it did on the Beverly Hillbillies.  Now it sounds like a combination of a modem and tires squealing on a road.  Wow, that's close.  Yeah, it's really, really deteriorated the poor gang.  All right, Anthony, why don't we start with Buddy Epson saying carpet muncher. 
[00:40:30]  Ah, all right.  Here it is.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  Wait, can I have some Sandy Kane sounds?  Did you ever think you'd hear Buddy Epson say carpet muncher?  That's the weird things that I like.  Yeah, I love this show.  I smell bit.  Eh, eh, eh.  I smell a Sandy Kane Buddy Epson remix.  Oh! 
[00:41:00]  A carpet muncher.  Eh, eh, eh.  A carpet muncher.  Ah!  A carpet muncher.  I don't blame it.  A carpet muncher.  Oh!  Oh!  All right, that's carpet muncher.  You got me, man.  Ah, here's Buddy Epson doing a famous line from Barnaby Jones.  All right.  Good evening, ma'am.  My name is Barnaby Jones.  I understand you went out to buy the evening paper one night ten years ago, and you want  me to find it because the supper's getting cold.  Ah!  I don't remember that episode. 
[00:41:30]  Good evening, man.  It's Barnaby Jones.  He was old then.  Remember you say, wow, look at Barnaby Jones.  He's like the geriatric gumshoe, you know.  He's just kind of walking around.  He's an old guy.  And that was back in, like, 74.  I was going to say, like, 75.  25 years ago.  It's Barnaby Jones.  Hello, ma'am.  Your husband left.  Oh, wait.  I'm your husband?  Let me get my hearing aids.  A different one.  Here's one that is just tragic.  Buddy Epson trying to sing the Beverly Hillbillies theme song. 
[00:42:00]  There's more of this, though, right?  Yeah, we're going to add to it, but Rick was running real fast to get this done while  we were in commercials.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely  kept his family fed, and then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when  people, I'm sorry.  Oh, my God. 
[00:42:30]  The horror of getting old.  And people say, well, I saw Jeannie in the room, and then you came back, and I don't  know where she went, and it was there, but now Major Nelson is gone.  It sounds, a lot of people are saying it sounds like Buddy said, crumpet muncher.  Oh, yeah, that's what the phone call's about?  Yeah, Jay.  I was reading feedback.  That's all right.  Jay.  Yeah.  Hey.  Sounds like crumpet muncher to me.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Sounds like an English guy or something.  Crumpet muncher?  All right, let's see that, yeah.  A crumpet muncher?  A crumpet muncher?  A crumpet muncher?  It does sound like crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  Jose.  A crumpet muncher?  That doesn't even matter.  I'm just going to call Dykes crumpet munchers now.  They're not going to know what they have by me.  Got it.  Who's running to opf3.com to steal that screen name?  I'm crumpet muncher.  I'm crumpet muncher.  A crumpet muncher?  Maybe the girls he's been with lately. 
[00:43:30]  A crumpet muncher.  Jose, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Yeah, I was going to say, when he says I'm sorry, he sounds so dejected, like, so defeated.  I got to hear it now.  I got to hear it now.  We got to add to this, because then there's a line where he goes,  Maybe you shouldn't have asked me to talk about it.  Maybe you shouldn't have asked me to talk about it yourselves.  Let me try another hearing aid.  All right, here's the song again.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, poor Montaner, barely kept his family fed. 
[00:44:00]  And then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Don't laugh at that.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened, Bill?  I was just talking. 
[00:44:30]  Some guy put Buddy Epson's info into deathclock.com, and it came up, he should have been dead November 3rd, 92.  You're laughing out there.  That's not funny.  And you hear it in the middle, he's like, I'm still writing it.  He said, I'm still writing it.  All right, let's compare the well doggies.  All right.  This is a very popular feature on our show.  We've been doing this for years.  Okay, we have the first time we ever talked to Buddy Epson when he was 87 years old. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Five years ago.  Here it is.  Well doggies.  You hear that?  Not a crackle in there.  87.  87 years young.  Well doggies.  Something happened.  Well doggies.  Nice.  So his voice box.  Okay.  Anthony.  All right.  We fast forward to when he was 90 years old.  Well doggies.  All right.  You hear the well.  It's all chewed up.  He almost gets the doggies out. 
[00:45:30]  It's still all bashed up.  Well doggies.  All right.  Why don't we compare?  87, Rick?  87?  Well doggies.  Well doggies.  90 years old.  Yeah.  One more time.  87 years old?  Well doggies.  90 years old.  Well doggies.  All right, kids.  Hold on to your seat.  All right.  Okay.  This is 92 years old.  Buddy Epson.  Well doggies. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  I've got to go home.  We've got to go.  We've got too far.  Oh no.  I've got to go home.  Oh, poor buddy.  Holy S.  Oh, that is horrible.  Now this is just a couple of years.  Let me give mine.  No, no.  Let's go right back to 87 years old.  87 years old.  Well doggies.  90 years old.  Well doggies.  92 years old.  Well doggies. 
[00:46:30]  That's not even funny, you ass.  We doggies.  And two years from now.  It gets gone higher and higher.  We doggies.  Well doggies.  I need to hear that one more time.  87 years old.  Well doggies. 
[00:47:00]  90 years old.  Well doggies.  92 years old.  Well doggies.  That's my joker from Jersey.  When you guys asked him to say well doggie again, I was waiting for him to say, why I did  it right the first time.  Get me a jury.  All right.  We better take a break.  Poor buddy.  That's awful.  God age.  I want to leave with the song.  Where do we go?  Because I think, oh you got it? 
[00:47:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  As we go to break, Buddy Epson.  Sing it.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jed Boer Mountaineer.  Barely kept his family fed.  And then one day, oh he, but he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm  sorry.  Hugo.  After hearing that, all I have to say is, I hear dead people. 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  Hugo, cut it out.  Oh, he's rocking.  Buddy Epson.  92.  God bless him.  O.P.  Anthony.  102.7 WNW.  See what was on the news?  Huh?  The submarine thing.  That's a pretty wacky story. 
[00:48:30]  It's getting better and better every day, too.  Well, like I said, new details come out every day.  They just trickle a few things out.  I'm sure the military would love to just keep everything quiet with this thing.  But they can't.  There were civilians on board the sub, and they were off of Hawaii somewhere in the Pacific,  and they did one of those power surface maneuvers they do.  They just blow the ballast tanks, and the thing comes up like a fish, doing that, like a dolphin. 
[00:49:00]  And, uh, oops, Jack Trawler was right above him.  You could say Jack, uh, Rick.  It was an acceptable term back in the 40s.  So was colored, but I guess we can't use Jack.  You could use Jack.  Jack Trawler.  I hate political correctness.  In the water.  It wasn't Chinese.  It was Jack.  Rick, they were Jacks.  Rick writes Chinese.  Look at how politically incorrect you are.  I don't care.  They're just jinx.  They have slanty eyes.  They have slanty eyes.  It's all the same. 
[00:49:30]  That was a Jack Trawler.  And the sub comes up, and, uh, what luck, the sub came up right underneath the boat.  Oh.  Sunk it in, like, nine minutes.  Now, it just sounded at first, like, oh, that's tragic, you know, the sub comes up.  Then it turns out there were some civilians on board.  But they said, yeah, on board the sub.  Yeah.  But they said they weren't near any of the controls or anything.  Then it comes out that one guy is at the helmsman station,  but they were, like, soldiers or, uh, uh, the seamen behind them. 
[00:50:00]  You said seamen.  Then both posts up by the helm were taken by civilians.  Then it turns out, it seems every post was manned by a civilian,  but there were, uh, one of the guys that was supposed to be stationed there  right behind him watching.  The guy that actually did the, uh, ballast blow maneuver was a civilian.  He, he pulled the lever.  So, they said they checked.  They looked through the periscope.  They did their sonar check. 
[00:50:30]  The sonar check, an hour before, showed the boat.  It was there.  They knew it was there.  Then the sonar guy left.  They're saying he was distracted by, oh, a civilian on board.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oops.  Uh, here's my theory.  Uh, they're having a little fun.  They've got some civilians on board they want to show.  Does your theory have anything to do with O.J. killing anyone?  Yes.  O.J. was working the captain's head because he had cut it off like a puppet.  Of course, reverting back to him. 
[00:51:00]  Staff is a ship.  Who cares about the slanty-eyed bastard?  It's O.J. and Joel.  Reverting back to the beginning of the show.  Okay.  Go ahead.  So, uh, I'm thinking some civilians on board.  You want to show off a little bit?  You're commanding a sub.  You got all the guys in there.  Wouldn't it sound cool?  It's like, hey, watch this.  We are going to pop up in front of this trawler and scare the bejesus out of these, uh, Japs.  Just watch.  Just for a great.  For a goof.  For a goof.  Imagine that.  You're sitting in the trawler.  You're like, oh, very good.  We learn, uh, fish.  We learn, uh, put net in water. 
[00:51:30]  Bring up, uh, a flipper.  And, uh, fewer seers and other things that Americans find cute and don't want feared.  Bring up in net.  And then, uh.  So for a chuckle, why not?  Imagine that, though.  You're just out in the water.  And for a goof.  And you would S your pants on the spot.  Oh, my God.  You're just sitting there.  All of a sudden, this huge submarine comes flying out of the water in front of you.  Godzilla!  Oh, no!  Godzilla!  Oh, no! 
[00:52:00]  Run!  All right.  Sorry, continue.  You know, just scare the hell out of him.  Be a goof. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  But since the sonar guy wasn't right there,  I guess they figured, well, it's got to be close by.  It can't be right over us.  Oops.  Wrong-o, right over him.  And took a big chunk out of it, and it sunk in like nine minutes.  A bunch of people had died.  A lot of people lived, though.  There were some survivors.  A lot of people lived, and they were like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:53:00]  A huge camera toll in the side of our boat.  When we get to America, you will be in the Yankee Cranky shop, 
[00:53:30]  or in their surrounds, or work at sushi restaurants.  What the hair was that?  It was so nice when you draw me on the ship.  You like a naked drawing I do of you?  You like a naked picture?  Yes, but why you make a rag so short and ass so frat? 
[00:54:00]  That's how you look.  You all look that way.  Ring there.  I am the emperor of the world.  This is a short movie.  Nine minutes wrong, and we sunk.  Crap.  Not even time to send up a frat. 
[00:54:30]  Not even time to whip up a fried rice.  Yoshi on the...  Oh, Yoshi on what?  Yoshi go both ways.  Chinese and Japanese.  Oh, we all went in the water.  Boat went down nine minutes.  That's when sharks come cruising.  I guess about seven o'clock first ones came.  And it's thought they're pounding and pounding. 
[00:55:00]  You hear high-pitched screaming and harrowing.  Horroring.  But they just keep pounding and pounding.  Riferous eyes like a geisha girl's eyes.  Whoever you are, I believe that she's a hot dog.  Someone needs a rocking chair once.  I will not stand by as you perform something out of a hot dog. 
[00:55:30]  See, on a piece?  I won't stand here while you cut that thing open and watch that little tongue-cunched whang boy  pour our door over dark.  A rice bird dead ahead.  What a tragedy.  Uh-oh.  Shots come cruising.  I'll never put on a rife jacket again. 
[00:56:00]  Are you ready to go back?  To turn one, jump one, jump one, jump one.  Oh, come quang!  Big shark.  Look like a big hand roll.  Come cruising.  Caves go in the water.  Chang-chang go in the caves.  Farewell in the door.  Do you fare chang-chang-bang radio? 
[00:56:30]  And amazing.  As the ship went down, the band kept praying and praying.  The band prayed on.  Many died that day.  But there were some survivors.  I dedicate this song to the brave men and women of the SS chung fa. 
[00:57:00]  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung!  Chung fa!  Oh, that's my heart will do.  Chung fa!  Oh, that's my heart will do.  Very dishonorable.  Sub came over a doll out of water  I crapped myself  Very dishonest  Let's go to the phone side 
[00:57:30]  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey  Every time we had civilians on board  We used to go crazy showing off  Wait, you were on one of those subs?  Yeah, I did eight years on a ballistic missile sub  So you would show off on the civilian  Watch this toss on out of your mind  This one's great  So you would show off for the civilians  What would you do?  Well, we used to do what they called angles and dangles  We used to go down really fast  And go deep  And then pull it back up  And one time we had such an upward angle  That we lost all our navigations 
[00:58:00]  Everything went offline  Because we had too steep of an angle  Ah, who cares?  All right  It's like, ah, what a ride  Who cares?  We need navigation  It's the sea  There's nothing out here  Watch the civilians arrest themselves  They used to be crazy  Oh, that's funny  You horarian  Very funny  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Crack the port open right fortune cookie  What up?  Hey, man, I was in the Navy for four years  And when you come back from Hawaii  It's like San Francisco  It's called a Tiger Cruise 
[00:58:30]  And you can bring like three of your family members  A ride on board  And you got little kids driving the ship  You got the old geriatrics  Oh, my God  This is great  What did this do?  Oh, my God  Hey, how were you  Son Wesker the way  We started selling pieces of the trawler  On the home shopping  Yeah  All right, buddy  Let's go to Chuck  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I was in the military for four years  They let my father drive an aircraft carrier  He's a phone man  He's a phone man  Come on 
[00:59:00]  Is that true, though, Brian?  Yeah, man  They, like the guy said, man  They take you from Hawaii to San Diego  Where I was stationed  And on the way back  They do a bunch of tours  They took him up to the bridge  The guy watched him  And there he is  He's got pictures and everything  Of him steering a thousand-foot  Billion-dollar aircraft  Look, I'm driving  What's that?  All right, guys  You rule  All right  Later  Tragedy 
[00:59:30]  At sea  Who's driving boat?  Who's driving submarine?  It's Eric Cartman  Rudy, what's going on?  In 1982, I was running a 148-foot supercruiser  Off Montauk Point  About 100 people on board  We had a submarine come up right in front of us  That's great  And I know I shit myself 
[01:00:00]  Oh, hey, oh, hey  Hold on, hold on  So a submarine came up in front of your boat  And you crapped yourself  Yeah  That's got to be intense looking  We're doing about 26, 28 knots  On a 148-footer  I do believe we have audio from that day  It's probably right for us  No  How close was it?  Came up about  Within 100 yards  Wow  Had my feet up  You've got to think they do that crap on purpose 
[01:00:30]  Because they're bored out there  That's not  They're supposed to put up a warning before they come up  All right, thank you  All right  All right  Japsub slam two torpedoes into our sides  Pay back a bitch  If I knew that would happen  I'd go to a reef  I'd turn around  Chief, what's going on?  You guys make me rock so hard  I'm going to drop crouching tiger in me  Come on up  Let's go to Marianne  Marianne, what's going on?  Hey guys, how are you?  I just called because I knew I kept my mouth shut long enough 
[01:01:00]  About wanting to hear some Yoshi bits  That he'd eventually turn up somewhere  And there he was  On the fishing ship  Who knew?  Yeah, Yoshi on the Titanic  I was just delivering some time  My little bicycle on the deck of boats  I was going to peddle back to Manhattan  Oh, that's my man  I love you, Jack  Yes, I know you love me 
[01:01:30]  There's plenty of room on that door you're floating on  I never understand why you won't arrest me on  And then when we all die  We end up back on Japanese trauma  Or young again  Waiting for another submarine  Very good 
[01:02:00]  Very touching tribute to those people  God damn  Oh, sugar stays out to the waist  Oh, they were hit with a boatload of semen  Well, they was  Oh, they're all as skinny as Alice  Look at the chinks  Well, they is  Rob, what's up?  Hey guys, how's it going? 
[01:02:30]  Good, man  Anyhow, I was in Coronado  I was coming back on a tiger cruise on Destroyer  About 400 guys or so  We let somebody's  The captain's father actually drive the ship  So we're coming through underneath the Coronado bridge  And this other boat was coming right for us  Coming right for us  He's coming right for us  So anyhow, we're coming right through it  And the captain goes  You know, we're telling the captain  He's getting a little close  And he's like, no, he'll move  This guy's coming right for us  And sure enough, they hit us  The whole thing goes all the way down  So now we stop the ship 
[01:03:00]  Now we stop the ship  And then we stop  Everything comes in  Everybody comes over  Trying to get this guy out  But it is a true fact  They do let people drive the ships  On a tiger cruise  That's just amazing  Yeah  I guess it happens every time  But when they come up  And nail a Japanese trawler  It's pretty bad  All they would have had to do  Is feed some spinach to the ship  Right in the engine  Would have kicked the subs' ass  Wait a minute  Hey, Stinkski  Load up my bowl 
[01:03:30]  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, man  Listen  I was in the Navy  During Nam  And I remember  Being at sea  In the North Atlantic  And firing salvo rounds  Over top of a rushing fishing ship  Just for the hell of it  Because, you know  They were out there  And we were firing rounds  Over top of them  They were on the radio  Talking back to us  And rushing  We had no idea  What they were doing  I was on the quarterdeck  Listening to this  Were you on the weed?  Were you on the weed?  Listening to Jimi Hendrix music 
[01:04:00]  Blasting and firing rounds  Hendrix a little bit  You know  Hendrix a little bit  Of deep purple  You know  And  You take away all the death  And destruction  Nam just looked like  One big party  It was unheard  Some cool equipment  And plenty of drugs  And nice rock music  There you go, Daddy-O  I swear to God  You know  And you know  As long as you still talk  Like you live in the 70s  People leave you alone  I swear to God, man  All right, Wayne  Thank you  All right  Let's take a break  Bye  Bye  There's a man 
[01:04:30]  Who pedals into danger  If you eat Chinese food  This guy's no stranger  He's weaving down the block  What you ought to be for a block  The man will risk his life  To bring you egg rolls  Little Asian man 
[01:05:00]  Little Asian man  He may just get run over  While bringing you low, man  His bike's a piece of crap  His basket's rusted  That's what I got to do  The seat is wrapped in tape  The brakes are busted  He uses shoes to stop 
[01:05:30]  That's when he hits that cop  Who still finds bits of rice  Inside his holster  Little Asian man  Little Asian man  He may just get run over  While bringing you low, man  Out of the way, musty river  You're fast where you go  Do you have a pity or shit

I had a bit in there about fat hairy guys 
[01:08:30]  Getting all kinds of women  And he comes up to me and he goes  You were talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, no  It was just a generic fat porno hairy guy  It wasn't really you  When you tell that joke on stage  Do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the form  It was just telling a story  Oh, I thought  Oh, I thought you said  That's something you do in your act  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone  Like you are now  And then you step up to the glass  On the door to the studio  Right

At first I was  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go  That is just so asinine  I have to laugh at it  But if you're going to get mad  At something like that  Maybe you shouldn't be on our show  Because we're juvenile  That's true  You know?  Well, it's up to you  I'm just hoping you put me on  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny

It's not annoying  It doesn't embarrass anyone  I like all forms of comedy 
[01:20:30]  It's not into humiliating anybody  We like all forms of comedy  Let's break us down like a rifle  No  We like Jim Norton  Who's as dirty as they get  And we love Brian Regan  Who's as clean as they get  And everyone in between  Jay Moore and the rest of the gang  You just have to go through  A certain amount of abuse  Until you get to be part of  The Opie and Anthony family  Yeah  I think we just got off  On the wrong foot  Somehow  That was  I don't know how that happened  That was Anthony's idea yesterday  I don't know how that happened  I think it's maybe because 
[01:21:00]  We hung up on you  And then when you were here  We called you from the lobby  Which would be really funny  If it wasn't happening to me  Hey, I like that  See?  It's always funny unless it's you  Yeah, it's always good  Unless you're the guy  Well, why don't we take a break  And regroup  All right, we'll regroup, Opie  And we'll, like, start over  All right  We'll start fresh  If you start yelling at us  We're just going to turn the mics on  I'm not yelling at us  Yeah, be prepared, affiliates  We might just pot the mics up  Yeah, because  If he's going to yell at us 
[01:21:30]  Everyone else has to hear it, too  Right  I'm not  Richard, Jenny  I think we should go to  An Italian restaurant  All three of us  Yeah?  Yeah  And I'll forget my gun inside  And then it'll all be fine  We'll be back with  The Opie and Anthony show  Stay there  Today, I'd like to talk to you  On a very serious note  Because this is the story  Of a man overcoming  Monumental physical pain  And suffering  Because I went to the DMV today  And it was really, really ugly  There's nothing funny  About what you're about to hear  Everything was organized  I went in there 
[01:22:00]  That's such a part of just being like a man  I was going to motor vehicle  Well, Anthony, I'm not a man  Work with me, son  So I get to the lady  And I must say  The nicest DMV lady ever  Ever  She wasn't the problem this time  The last three times  They were the problem  All right  So she's going through all the forms  Like, okay  We'll get you out of here  In a jiffy  Right  And she's going through all the stuff  And I'm like, all right  Finally, fourth time  Going to the DMV  To get my vehicle registered  This is it  I'm finally going to have  New York plates  Fools be told  Today's world can be 
[01:22:30]  Namby-pamby  All of a sudden she says  Okay, I just need a  Copy of the title  Is this the title?  I started panning  What to do?  What to do?  So I had to get  The leasing company on the line  This was the last time I went  To send me the power of attorney  Basically saying  It's okay to register  The car in New York State  All right  Uh-huh  You would think that people  When they're sending that  Would send a copy of the title  Knowing I'm going to need that  As well, Anthony  No, you can't expect them 
[01:23:00]  To do that  So I don't have the title  So now I can't do it  So now I'm ready to go home  Which means I'd have to go back  To the DMV for the fifth time  No, no, no  So then the lady  Sees the panic on my face  She goes, look  Can you get the leasing company  To fax it over  The title  If I get a fax of it  Boom, you're out of here  In two minutes  I'm like, no problem  He realizes he's got to get it  So I go out in the hall  It's key to the story  That you know  I only had 70 cents in my pocket  I call the leasing company 
[01:23:30]  And I explain my situation  I need my, you know  The title faxed over to the DMV  The lady says  I can't do that for you  You have to talk to Judy  Judy is busy  With another customer  You'll have to call her back  Click, hangs up on me  No, no, no  I don't have enough money  To call damn Judy  So what do I do?  I drive all the way home  He figures  What the heck?  And I call Judy  And I give her a piece of my mind  I say, Judy  Listen  You have to fax  A copy of the title  To DMV 
[01:24:00]  Right now  Will there be a problem?  She says, oh, no problem at all  Will you do it now?  She goes, yes  I go, okay  I am going to leave my house  For the DMV  I expect that title  To be faxed  When I get there  That is beautiful  All right, it gets better  So I go back to the DMV  Everyone knows now  Because I was there an hour before  Or whatever, okay?  I spend 20 minutes  Staring at the fax machine  Waiting for a copy of the title  To come through  What to do?  What to do?  20 minutes later  It's not coming through  The fax machine, okay? 
[01:24:30]  He said it would not work  After 20 minutes away  In the DMV  I'm like, okay  There's a problem  Now I have to make another call  I don't have any change  No, no, no  So I'm at the customer service  I explain, look  The lady was supposed to fax  It 20 minutes ago  I've been staring at the fax machine  There's a problem  I need to use your phone  She goes, there's a phone  In the lobby there  Or whatever, right?  I said, no  I have one nickel  I can't make a call  The lady  Supposedly part of customer service  Goes, you'll have to talk  To her supervisor  His arm arose  I go, it's a goddamn phone call 
[01:25:00]  Give me your phone  Sir, you're building bridges  You're making friends  Now the real friendly teller  Heard me screaming at the lady  And she goes  And she goes, here  And she hands me a cordless phone  I go, thank you  And then I turn to the customer service lady  And I go, was that hard to do?  He got up and got one  So I call the leasing company again  I go, hi  Remember you said you would fax it in 20 minutes?  I've been staring at the fax machine 
[01:25:30]  Guess what?  Nothing is popping out  What's the problem?  Oh, I'll fax it right over  I made a copy of it  It was too light  Blah, blah, blah  I'm like, will you fax it right now  Before I come back in here  With an automatic weapon  And shoot everybody?  And did she?  She did  She did?  15 minutes later  She sends it over  You've got moxie  And don't let anyone ever take that away from you  And then I paid my $72.50  So I wrote the check  And I got out of there  Young man  Do you ever look back  And wonder what would have happened  If you'd just given up 
[01:26:00]  If you hadn't followed your dreams?  I took five trips to DMV  To get my license and my registration  And I think we've all learned a lesson from this  You've showed us that while no man is an island  The one man can make a difference  And now I'm registered in New York  Pretty cool  I'd say you are very cool  A very cool cat indeed  WNEW  It's the Opie and Anthony show

What's the problem?  No, it's just...  It's Ron Jeremy.  He's called all the right spots.  Get it out of the way, and there's something waiting for you.  This is for 20 bucks, so you can enjoy the U2 show. 
[01:39:00]  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  Patty, after you do this, we're going to show you where that's been.  Roll a few videos.  You've got to go near there.  You can't escape touching it.  I don't think I...  Higher, higher.  Go get it, Patty.  Come on.  How did you pull my hands out of there?  Patty.  I'm going to leave you for a while.  Put it around there.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to lift up where it's hidden.  You have to lift it. 
[01:39:30]  You have to lift it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You're going to bleep it.  Hold on.  Yeah, hold on.  Patty, Patty.  What?  Patty.  What is the problem?  Yeah, what's the problem, Patty?  I don't know what I got to.  I've never done anything like this before in my life.  Anita has Ron for 20 bucks.  She's a new one for both of us.  Anita has Andrew Jackson.  All right, she's back in there, Anne.  Back in.  To your left.  My left is the third way.  Yes, go to your left.  That's it.  That's it.  Now go underneath.  You're there. 
[01:40:00]  Go a little more underneath.  You've got to get it out of the way, honey.  You can't avoid it.  Come on, honey.  You have to go underneath.  Come on, grab.  Don't be afraid of it.  It's not going to bite.  Just nibble.  Come on, Patty.  You're real close.  It's very close.  Keep going.  Patty's like right there, under there.  A little more.  Patty.  You've got to use it.  Oh, my God.  She's right in there.  She got it.  She got it.  She got it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:40:30]  Why does it look like it's got strudel icing on it?  Oh, that was done on me.  That's where we're at.  It's perfectly clean.  Oh, my God.  There's nothing more.  Well, there's nothing I have that she hasn't grabbed.  Let's put it that way.  Patty, I feel it's so much closer now.  Don't you?  Patty, that was the first time you've ever been in that area, right?  Yeah.  How did it feel?  How did it feel?  Weird.  It felt a little weird.  Would you ever let a guy fish anything out of your bottoms? 
[01:41:00]  No?  Not yet.  Tomorrow.  How about for another 20?  This keeps going.  Patty.  For another 20.  If we put a 20 down the front of your pants and Ron fishes it out, we'll give it to you  also.  This keeps going until she's bleeding from the black.  And he's behind her going, do you want popcorn or don't you?  Do you want refreshments or not?  Make up your mind.  Stinky, go get my wallet.  Go get my wallet. 
[01:41:30]  I got a 20.  I got one.  You pay me later.  Okay.  Yeah.  You want another 20 much, Patty?  So far, she's fished out.  But it's going to be an eight-man interracial dwarf.  Here it is now.  Who's going to break Houston's record by the time we leave today?  Want to pass that on over?  There you go.  That's the clean one.  Okay.  All right.  Patty.  You put it in your pants real deep.  What you got to do is put it in an area, the same type of area Ron had his 20 in.  It's got to be right there. 
[01:42:00]  Look, I'm manicured.  See?  Manicured.  Don't put it in the front.  It's got to be right on the undercarriage, if you know what I mean.  And not interfered by any clothing or anything.  And then Ron will go in there and grab the 20 out, and that 20 will also be yours.  I'm saying.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to stand up.  You'll really be shaking later.  You've got to stand up.  You've got to.  Should I kiss it back to your neck when I do this?  All right.  Yeah.  Give her the reach around.  Get her with the reach around.  I'm not the reach.  Wait.  Wait.  Turn around.  You don't want Ron to know where you're putting it. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I won't look at it.  But, Norton, you make sure she's putting it way under there.  All right.  Patty, you've got to stand up.  I'm not looking.  Patty, that's got to go right on the Mason-Dixon line.  You know what I mean?  Take the blindfold off.  Go ahead.  You've got to go under the panty.  Right on the equator.  I don't care.  I've got to put it down.  Deep down.  Deep down.  No, Patty, that's still in front.  You've got to go right under.  Underneath.  Under.  Make believe it's a Maxie.  Oh, my God.  Flying on the wings of a Maxie.  Patty, 46-year-old virgin.  Let's blindfold Ron.  Okay. 
[01:43:00]  It's only fair.  It's only fair, Ron.  It's only fair.  It's not worth my stuff.  I should be able to find it.  I can't really.  Where's the blindfold?  Where's the blindfold?  It's broken.  Count Ron's rings.  Make sure they're all there when he pulls his pants back out.  I would secure that.  Oh, you took them off.  I don't want to lose them down there.  Of course.  We're blindfolding, Ron.  Patty has hidden a $20 bill.  Yeah.  Right on the undercarriage.  We're talking right where every automotive needs rust-proofing. 
[01:43:30]  The 46-year-old virgin Patty.  Okay.  All right.  Patty, you ready for this?  All right.  All right, Jim.  Jim, make sure you mic Patty.  All right, Ron now searching, going down on the belly.  He is now finding the panty line.  There he goes.  Oh, my God.  Patty is freaking out.  I'm not ready yet.  Oh, my God.  Patty can't believe it. 
[01:44:00]  She's in shock.  Ron Jeremy turns firmly down her pants.  She's buckled over, doubling over, her mouth agape.  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen Patty like this?  This is unbelievable.  She's like, dude, she's enjoying this.  She just had to know.  I think she just owed.  Oh, my God.  I'm almost there.  She's almost got it, Patty.  She's almost got it.  You got to stand up. 
[01:44:30]  She's almost got it, Patty.  You're going to U2.  You're going to have $40 spending money, Patty.  I'm so surprised Ron can't find it.  Yeah, Ron.  You can't find it?  I thought you were an expert at this time.  Oh, my God.  I think you lost the ring that time.  She's twitching.  She's twitching.  This is one small step for a minute. 
[01:45:00]  She's on the floor.  Oh, no.  Did you get it?  He got it.  He got it.  Oh, my God.  Okay, wait a minute.  That's 210.  She made change.  Hey, Richard.  What happened there?  Patty, wait a minute.  I certainly earned that.  Now, how much will you give me if I smell Jeremy's fingers? 
[01:45:30]  Now, Patty, I got to ask you.  Put it on close to Patty.  How did that feel?  Where?  It's weird again.  Listen, I got to say in all fairness, I wasn't too much there, but I could tell she was a little on the excited stage.  Is that true?  Patty, did you feel a little excitement there, Patty?  Be honest.  You got a tingly feeling?  Yeah.  She did.  That's a tingly.  The roof of my mouth.  The roof of your mouth.  That's where it starts.  Well, Ron could take care of that. 
[01:46:00]  I was going to say we have a cure for that.  There's a protein paste that takes care of the...  She wasn't totally unexcited.  Let's put it that way.  You can tell, right?  Yes.  I think she might be sticking to the seat as we speak.  Patty, now, did that feel kind of good and kind of different?  What do you think?  Patty?  It felt different.  Different, but...  Different good or different bad?  Different...  I don't know why.  Different than a different denomination? 
[01:46:30]  Different weird.  Patty, have you ever had that done to you?  No.  No.  And it's Ron Jeremy's the first guy to touch it.  Matt, are you going to be disappointed after today?  I think we should all join hands and sing We Are the World.  Right.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I cannot believe the first person to touch her piece was Ron Jeremy.  How often has she been in the studio?  She's been coming in here for three years, just about.  Yeah, but it's how she really did **** in here. 
[01:47:00]  Ow.  Get those pictures up on the website immediately.  Yeah, and usually virgins are like that, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  They get some done very easily.  Oh, God.  Fantastic.  Well, Patty, you not only got U2 tickets and $40 to spend at the show, but you got...  Now, guys, let me ask you this.  If she puts another bill down there, I attach crazy glue to the ****.  Okay, just kidding.  Patty, you felt something there that you never felt before, though, right? 
[01:47:30]  Fishing for dollars, right?  You felt something you never felt before.  Oh, yeah.  And it was kind of exciting.  It was kind of strange.  Do you shave?  I mean, do you shave, like, for summer for bathing suits and stuff?  Yeah, I do.  Because it wasn't a big...  It didn't seem like a virginal, though.  Like, most virginals usually like a lot of hair.  She did not have that much.  No, she's all ready to go.  You're shaving for bathing suits.  The car's gassed up, pointed in the right direction. 
[01:48:00]  She just stopped putting it in dry.  Have you seen her below the waist?  No.  Yeah, we have.  We got pictures of it.  Totally nude?  Yeah.  She's a nice physique.  Well, it's a photo of me in the whipped cream bikini.  You're very sexy, honey.  Some guys will be very happy when he finally plays a game of hide the bacon with you.  And shoot the sherbet and drain the main thing.  He's a very happy fellow.  That's un-effing believable.  Who thought the day would come?  Three years ago, when Patty first came in here, we said, in three years, Ron Jeremy's 
[01:48:30]  going to put his hand down the front of your pants and touch that area.  She would have said no way.  Anybody here would have got, except her in the future.  Ron, you may leave the studio and pass the first homeless guy she sees on the bench.  Ron, you don't even know how great that was.  I was having a good time.  You don't even know.  Yeah.  Hey, glad to be with assistants.  Rick is previewing some of the pictures.  It's nice.  Get those on the website.  Patty, you enter a long, illustrious line of ladies that have had that done to them. 
[01:49:00]  Listen, I think right now, he could put a dollar there.  I should probably do it for that.  No.  I am so amazed that that ever even happened.  For one dollar, he can get it like five sticks of bubblegum.  So what do you say?  Wow.  All right.  We should take a break.  If you pay us 20 bucks, I'll fish for it.  Let's take a break and hose off.  Yeah, we got to get Richard Jenny out of here.  He did a great job.  See, Richard, it turns out okay.  We got off to an obnoxious start, and it turns out really well. 
[01:49:30]  May the Lord squat on your life and spray his blessings upon you.  That's Richard.  Richard Jenny.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  We'll be back in just a bit.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is  This Station, 1027 WNEW, New York.  We'll be right back. 
[01:50:00]  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  I don't say it!  Hi, Anthony, if I can.  Yeah.  The great Buddy Epson, singing. 
[01:50:30]  Come and listen to the story about a man named Paul Montaner, barely kept his family fed.  And then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people,  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:51:00]  We got a lot of negative email on that one.  Use it on music.  For the record, the publicist told us, or said that Buddy sings a very interesting version  of the song.  Oh, I thought you were going to say the publicist called and was pissed.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  They encouraged us.  They say, hey, have Buddy sing.  He does a good version of the theme song.  Yeah, we thought he had some kind of a parody version, you know.  So we asked him, and that was what we got. 
[01:51:30]  All right, let's go to the phone.  212-757-1027.  Stan, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to let Anthony know today's Tom Brokaw's birthday.  Is it?  How old is Tom Brokaw?  I don't know.  I just know it's his birthday.  I figured I'd say happy birthday.  All right, thank you.  Maybe we could talk to him later.  I wonder how old he is today, huh?  I don't know.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:52:00]  I'd like to thank everyone here at NBC Nightly News  for throwing me this fabulous birthday bash  on my 61st birthday.  Tom, would you like a hit for your birthday?  I'm 61.  Sure.  Let me pass this over to you, will we?  Let me get that.  There you go.  Oh, wow, that's some good crap. 
[01:52:30]  Unbelievable.  I plan on going out through a couple of raves tonight  and take some eggs.  I'm going to hook up with some ladies  and get my F on  and bust three nuts  because that's the kind of guy I am.  Who wants to be Tom's B.I.? 
[01:53:00]  I'm going to go out with J-Lo  and shoot up some places.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Last night, Tom Brokaw shooting up a bar  with his new girlfriend, J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  I love that booty.  Your voice is effed up today.  That's a great eff.  Well, if I wasn't doing the QVC Shop at Home card guy, 
[01:53:30]  perhaps my voice wouldn't be so effed up.  Don't forget Dudley Moore.  Wonderful.  And everyone else.  Mr. Brokaw.  Yes.  It's a busy little day for Tom Brokaw  here on NBC Nightly News.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  I see Ronald Reagan's on the phone.  Oh, really?  I wonder what he's going to sound like today.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Ronald Reagan's birthday. 
[01:54:00]  Damn, I can't say that right.  Ronald Reagan's birthday.  Yeah, birthday.  Joey Big Arms from Fairlawn.  Prior to talking with Ronald Reagan,  Anthony, make sure you go to the bathroom,  and Rick is handling the phone systems  so there are no problems.  Then you can finally talk to one of your heroes.  That would be nice.  Wouldn't that be good?  Is he on the phone?  Well, let's pick him up.  Okay. 
[01:54:30]  Pop him down.  All right.  Would you like to talk to the former president?  Yeah.  Finally, Anthony?  Pop him down.  It's kind of strange.  I'm always the one interviewing him.  I know.  You're nowhere to be seen.  All right.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan, how are you today?  Hello?  Hello?  Hmm, he's not there for some reason.  I hear noises in the background.  Maybe he fell again.  Or maybe they're waking him up so he can talk to us today.  I hope it's not a problem with the phone equipment.  Maybe I should go out and make sure that Jack is connected. 
[01:55:00]  No, I think Rick could handle that, Anthony.  Can Rick handle that?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Right, Stinky?  Rick's working on the phone to make sure it's okay?  He's playing with it.  I don't know.  I better check that out.  No, no, no.  We really want you to talk to Ronald Reagan today.  I would love to.  It's an honor.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan.  Yeah.  How are you on your 90th birthday?  I hear the phone.  I hear it, too.  But, see, he's there.  I don't think...  I think it's a problem with the phone line.  I better go and make sure that Jack is plugged in, because I know it. 
[01:55:30]  I've seen this phone before, a lot of problems with it, and I know how to fix it.  Why don't you just tell Rick to fix the phone?  All right, let me go back and tell Rick to fix the phone.  No, no, no, Anthony, no.  I'll go back.  What?  No, no, no, no.  Ben, Stinky, come here.  Maybe I should go and tell Rick.  I want to prove this once and for all.  It's like a Superman episode.  Can you get Ben in here?  I mean, Rick.  I'm sorry, Rick.  Yeah, Rick?  I'll get him.  No, no, no.  I want you to sit here for once. 
[01:56:00]  What?  Hey, Rick?  Rick, how you doing?  Can you fix the phone?  Anthony talks about...  What is it?  What?  It's because of the computer system that we have hooked up with, and I know I look really  good with computers.  Yeah, see, I know I can do this.  No, no.  Perhaps I can do it.  Scott is gone?  No, no.  I think he might be my best bet to try and get this in.  Why don't you fiddle with it a little bit?  I really want Anthony talks.  Is that Ken out in the office?  No, no.  He's waving at me.  No, wait.  One second.  No, I've got to talk to Ken Stevens. 
[01:56:30]  I want you...  For a second, but I'll be back to talk to Ronald Reagan.  No, I want you to talk to the former president for once.  I will.  I'll be right back.  And there seems to be a problem.  By the time we fix it, I'll be done with Ken Stevens.  I am sick of carrying your ass and doing all the interviews.  No, no, Anthony.  I'll be right back.  No, wait, Anthony.  No.  I'll be right back.  No.  No.  Two seconds.  I'll be right back.  Ken.  Ken Stevens.  I see Ken out there.  All right.  All right.  Well, come back in.  How much longer do I have to wait for this call? 
[01:57:00]  Hello?  President Reagan.  Yes.  Could you hold on a minute?  I want you to talk to my buddy and my pal, my partner on the radio, Anthony.  Yes, I know Anthony.  He's a very, very talented young man.  Even with my Alzheimer's, I can say.  No, he's not that talented.  That man is fabulous.  No, he's not.  He's marvelous.  Listen, you know, it's my birthday today.  Yes, it is, sir.  Stinky, hold on.  Stinky.  Yes.  Where's Anthony as I talk to the former president of the United States? 
[01:57:30]  He's out there with Ken.  Where?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll be like two seconds.  I'm right here with Ken.  What are you guys talking about?  Wait, the president is on the line.  I can't take this.  If I'm not, I'm busy.  And, well, it's my birthday.  Sir, we wanted to wish you a very happy 90th birthday today, but I want Anthony to talk to you.  You're one of his heroes.  Yes, I know.  Did I say how much I admire that man? 
[01:58:00]  He's a fine American.  He's not that great.  And on this mind, well, 90th birthday, I'd like to say, God bless Anthony.  Because he, oh, wait a minute.  Nancy's calling me to open a gift.  You bastard.  You bastard.  Could you hold on while I open a gift?  Sure.  Because it is my birthday.  All right, I'll hold on a second.  Anthony, we're talking to the president.  Ken just had a little problem.  All right, well, he's on the line. 
[01:58:30]  Talk to him.  I was talking.  Hello?  He's not here.  What do you mean?  I was just talking to him.  Where did he go?  I don't know.  Mr. President, it looks like you don't need that home gym anymore.  Mr. President?  Hello?  He said he was opening up a gift or something for his 90th birthday.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  When he gets back on call, I'm just going to finish up with him.  Ed, Ed.  What a swell gift.  No, I know it's you now, Anthony.  It's you.  It's a set of golf clubs.  No, Ed, I am convinced. 
[01:59:00]  You know, I play one hole of golf 18 times because they're all new to me.  Ed, you use that line every goddamn time you imitate Reagan.  I know it's you now.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I know it's you.  Don't you insult Anthony.  You bet.  That man is a true American hero.  No, no, you, Anthony.  Oh, hold on.  They're cutting the tape.  It's my 90th birthday.  And if I don't blow these candles out, the whole place is going to go up. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  So hold on.  All right.  Anthony, don't forget to add that line about how big your wife's head is.  All right, Ken.  I'm doing a job.  Holy smoke, this guy.  Can he get it?  I'm doing a show, Ken.  Opie, I'm sorry.  Try to stretch it long enough.  Ed, Ed.  What?  I know it's you.  Everyone knows it's you now. 
[02:00:00]  You look silly.  What a dandy cake.  Ed, Ed, I just saw you.  You were right there.  I know the phone that you're talking on is like 20 feet away.  Look, you young prankster.  Don't be saying things like this about my good friend, Anthony.  I'll send secret service over there.  Well, you won't be happy.  What are you going to do?  Oh, look, another present.  Let me, I'll open this one on your show.  Ed, if the listeners listen closely, they can hear you as Reagan out of breath because 
[02:00:30]  everyone knows you're not in shape.  No, I just blew out the candles and there were 90.  What a little bit.  Hold it.  Oh, what a great gift.  It's a set of golf clubs.  I've always wanted these.  You know, I play one hole of golf 18 times.  I know.  It's all new to me.  Yeah, exactly.  See, that's Alzheimer's.  Anthony, they're all waiting for the lines about how big Nancy's head is.  Might as well get it out there.  I don't remember ever saying that.  Now we're going to go play Pin the Tail on the Democrat. 
[02:01:00]  One of my favorite games.  Yeah.  Could you please hold on?  Of course.  Now Anthony's going to come back in the studio.  Opie?  Ed?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Wait, you're not in the studio.  Where are you?  I'm sitting right in front of you, you jerk.  You're not in front of me.  No one's going to believe...  Hello?  Hi, it's me again, Ron Ray. 
[02:01:30]  Hello?  Wait, Mr. President, this is fabulous.  Speaking to you is an honor.  Well, Anthony, you've always been one of the greatest Americans on the face of this earth.  And I've got to tell you, I don't appreciate your friend Opie making some kind of a wacky gag out of the fact that you were me or...  Well, I don't even know what he was saying. 
[02:02:00]  I'm incoherent myself sometimes, but that boy...  I know, Mr. President, it gets a little rough having to deal with him on a daily basis.  I see you!  What?  You're talking to yourself!  What are you talking about?  I'm here talking to yourself!  You're in front...  I'm in the studio.  You're here.  You're talking to yourself.  Mr. President, I apologize for this.  It's an honor to speak to you.  Hello?  Hello?  Well, yes, that boy is very rude, and I can't believe he would pull some kind of shenanigans like this on my 90th birthday. 
[02:02:30]  I just went in the studio and saw you talking to yourself.  What studio?  We're in the studio, and I'm sitting in front of you talking to Ronald Reagan.  What's wrong with that boy?  I don't know, Mr. President.  It's out of hand. 
[02:03:00]  Well, you better fix him, because I'm not going to stay on the phone with him in the same room as you.  I know, in the same room as me, Mr. President.  Can I continue my birthday party now?  Yes, sir.  Yes, Mr. President, whatever you wish to do.  And finally, what an honor to talk to you.  And what an honor to speak to you, Anthony.  Godspeed, and God bless.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And there he goes, Hopi. 
[02:03:30]  Bastard, I hate you.  I was in the studio.  I saw you talking to yourself.  Now you're running back into the studio.  What are you talking about?  I've been sitting here the whole time.  You're such a bastard.  You bastard.  You bastard.  You bastard.  What?  Sorry, I'm out of breath.  I was so nervous talking with the president. 
[02:04:00]  That was exciting, Hopi.  Finally.  Finally.  I hear next, Chris Jericho and Moongoose McQuaid are coming in.  I think that was our, who's on first bit?  Hopi, suffering from Dr. Bellows disease.  You bastard.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  I don't care how.  I don't care if it's really you or not. 
[02:04:30]  Whatever.  But however you just pulled that off, that is going to be the damn funniest things you  guys have ever done on this radio show.  I don't care if it's you or not.  That was hilarious.  No, of course not.  Thank you, Matt.  Well, I guarantee you, Rick helped him out on that.  I give up.  I give up.  I saw him talking to himself.  I can't prove that.  I wasn't.  This is radio.  You see?  Guys, I've got to go listen to myself.  I can't prove it. 
[02:05:00]  But you were there?  By yourself?  Talking to yourself?  Yes.  No one's going to believe me now?  What?  Please.  I was speaking from right here in front of you, and you were trying some wacky bit.  I think you finally lost it.  Scott, what's up?  Oh, I'm so happy that you finally got to talk to the president.  I know.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you so much, Scott.  It must be an honor to talk to the president.  It was.  It just warmed my heart to hear how I know how sick he is now. 
[02:05:30]  I hate all...  I hate you all.  I hate you.  Don't hate.  Don't hate.  The president.  I left this studio.  I went down the hall where Anthony was doing his clever rules.  But I went through the hall, and the genie was...  Major...  You were there.  But then I saw the...  You were there.  Major Nelson.  You were there.  Genie went...  But then I saw the...  And I heard...  Carolyn.  Carolyn.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys could do that little skit on the XFL show,  so maybe if we see it, the acting would be better. 
[02:06:00]  Thank you, Carolyn.  You're welcome.  Very funny.  All right.  All right.  Well, let's take a break.  Oh, okay.  Whew.  This is pretty good.  I love obscure references.  Andrew from Jersey.  And come on.  We all know Ken is still out on his lunch break.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Hello.  Can I speak for Mr.  Uh, this is he.  How you doing?  My name is Jessette, and I'm calling for...  What's happening, Jessette?  How you doing?  All right.  My name is Jessette, and I'm calling for...  Cabinery Facing.  Right on, Jessette.  And the purpose of my call is to tell you about a service that we are providing for home owners.  Ow!  Oh, man, that hurt!  Oh!  Damn! 
[02:07:00]  Ow!  Oh, you still there, Jessette?  Yes.  Oh, sorry about that.  I just burnt my hand on the stove.  Ow!  F***!  All right.  Sorry about that.  I'm sure you would agree that the kitchen is one of the most important rooms in your home.  I would totally agree on that.  How old are the kitchen cabinets?  I'm about 25 years old.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  Would you be interested?  Ow! 
[02:07:30]  God damn!  Ow!  I just closed the door on my hand.  Of the cabinet, actually.  Oh.  Sorry, go ahead.  Would you be interested in our service?  I'm interested in a painkiller at this moment in time.  Jessette, where are you located?  Well, my office is located in Palm Bay. 
[02:08:00]  Do you have anyone in the b***ing area?  Because I could really use some beer.  Excuse me?  I could use some beer.  Well, we don't supply that.  Well, I'm in pain.  I need some beer.  Well.  Anyone in the b***ing area, maybe they could come over and show us what this whole cabinet thing is all about and give me some beer.  Well, what I could do is I'm going to call an expert to your home.  Um, that's not a bad idea.  Excuse me? 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  Continue.  What I could do is I could send a pull-up an expert to your home and they could take a look at your kitchen cabinet and they could...  Oh, God!  Ah!  You want to see us?  Hello, Jessette.  O.B. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  212-757-1027. 
[02:09:00]  The O&A Show.  Thanks.  Finally, we get to Jackie the Knife Girl.  Finally.  It's been long enough.  Let's go.  We got Drew Boogie in the studio, our new friend.  Yeah.  Jamaken Mike is here.  Big Kevin's here.  Yeah, Jamaken Mike.  A hot, wax Shannon is here.  She's got a little present for us.  She's going to bring it in a little while.  But, uh, why don't we get to Jackie the Knife Girl, Anthony?  Yes.  Do you want to, like, set this up really fast?  I was called up yesterday.  I don't know what we're talking about, but... 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Called up yesterday.  We found out she has a knife fetish on the phone.  And a roommate over here was dragging knives across her.  And she was squealing with delight in such a way that, uh, I think every radio is tuned in and the guys are having problems driving.  The guys really like that.  Oh, no, never be sorry about that.  They don't want to crash cars.  No, no.  That was the whole goal.  Yeah.  That is always the goal.  It worked.  Of this show, to get people to crash cars.  So, she was cordially invited to come in today and have various knives dragged across her to see what this, uh, is like live. 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  You know?  A fine looking lady.  Sure.  She's a stripper.  Dancer, huh?  Yes.  You want to plug where you're a dancer?  Yes.  I work at Cabaret in, uh, Eatontown, New Jersey.  Eatontown.  Yeah.  Yes.  You're going to have a lot of people showing up.  It's, uh, right by the Mom's Mall.  It's on Highway 35 North.  It'll be great.  You'll get fans.  They'll follow you to your car at night with knives.  Oh, wonderful.  Fascinating.  This is great.  All right.  Why don't we get into this, Andrew?  Yes.  Why don't we? 
[02:10:30]  All right.  Uh, now, who do you want to do the knife thing?  You want Rob to do?  I trust him.  You trust Rob?  Let Rob do it, man.  I'm afraid everybody else is going to stab me.  All right.  Rob's got the, wow, Rob's got the Rambo knife that Scott brought in earlier.  And his, uh, you got the other knife, too?  The bagel knife?  Give me that mic.  I gotta move on.  Don't confuse bagel knife with, uh, with little butter knife.  Bagel knife is big, long, serrated knife he used to cut the bagels in the bagel stores.  You ever see those guys?  You need a machete, man.  All right, Jackie?  A machete. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, a machete.  Really?  Jamaica, what's that?  A machete.  A machete?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That means something else here.  A Jamaican Mike, just be quiet.  We got a girl that's stripping.  Yeah, Jamaican Mike, what are you going to say to chase her out of here?  Yeah.  Make a slap you and run.  We're just moving some taking it easy to live.  Jackie, you can get more comfortable if you like.  Looks like you have some nice panties on, under those leather, uh, pants.  Jackie's getting naked, Anthony.  Stinky's got the field mic. 
[02:11:30]  It's Jackie the knife girl.  She gets turned on by having, um, knives rubbed all over her body.  Wonderful.  Her roommate, who she's not having sex with, uh, Rob, is going to do the, uh, the deed.  As a matter of fact, hi, Rachel.  Ah.  Oh.  So there's a guy named Rachel involved here.  That's what I'm figuring out.  It's, uh, his fiance.  I'm teasing, of course.  All right, so Rob wants to make it perfectly clear that he is not having sex with Jackie the knife girl.  You know, this moment looks very dangerous.  Look at this. 
[02:12:00]  This looks like the beginning of a snuff film.  Yeah.  It really does.  Rob, can we trust you?  Because that's a Rambo knife.  We're not playing with bagel knives anymore.  Actually, the bagel knife is far better than the Rambo knife anyway.  If you stab her and kill her, syndication's put off by, like, what, two months?  That would suck.  Uh, five to ten.  Syndication from Zing's, five to ten?  Yeah.  Syndication.  When we get out of prison.  Don't fall with those knives in your head.  Oh, my God.  It almost, like, took her head off. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  You've got to work the Rambo knife, too.  And where's the Freddy Krueger glove, just for laughs?  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  He's already starting.  Oh, no, Stinky.  Stinky just hit the knife with the mic and almost went through her.  Stinky, get near her mouth more.  Yeah.  All right, Rob is working the bagel knife all over her body.  And we had a lot of requests to be completely silent for this for a second. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:00]  He's picking up the Rambo knife. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy S. 
[02:15:30]  He just picked up the pretty girl.  He just picked up the pretty girl. 
[02:16:00]  He just picked up the pretty girl. 
[02:16:30]  She's got like knife marks all over her belly.  Her belly is like big. 
[02:17:00]  He just picked up the pretty girl.  He just picked up the pretty girl.  He just picked up the pretty girl.  He just picked up the pretty girl.  You're listening to the sounds of a knifing. 
[02:17:30]  They don't usually bring you the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife.  Watch that knif.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's working.  Oh, my God.  He just plunged the knife into the couch. 
[02:18:00]  That was scary. 
[02:18:30]  She's got a knife down her panties.  You could fillet her up real nice.  It'll tenderize and down you go.  I'm going to stand here and watch him cut that thing open and have that little Kittner voice spill out all over the floor. 
[02:19:00]  This isn't a place for comedy.  Shut up.  Crown zero.  This is a turn-on. 
[02:19:30]  Go for her throat.  Oh, you wrecked it.  Hey, I ruined it.  You ruined it.  I ruined it.  You know, what a way to end, though.  Bravo!  Wow, nice.  Let me be the first to say the most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life right there. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  That was something.  My God.  You've got to be kidding me.  I've got to try it.  Steve.  Yeah.  Get to that mic.  You've got footage, right?  I have tons of footage.  That was some of the steadiest camera work I have ever done.  Soundrymusic.com.  Later on tonight, you'll get to see the video of that.  But Rob.  Rob and Jackie.  Holy ass.  But you didn't have to have O.J. come in.  I can't possibly compare to O.J.  No, no, no.  Now, my machine didn't last that long. 
[02:20:30]  Wait a minute.  I was in and out.  You've got to come back here for a second.  Yeah.  Look at her body.  Wow.  I saw.  I was right there.  There are knife scratches all over her body.  She's all pink.  No, it's not just.  No, and it's not like she's pink.  It's like a cat.  You know when you get clawed by a cat?  It's all over her belly, all over her legs.  That's what I was saying when I saw her laying there.  They're like just fine scratches all over her body.  Bravo.  How was that, Jackie?  Very nice.  Very nice? 
[02:21:00]  I don't know what else to say.  That was just amazing.  Anthony.  What are you thinking?  That was nice.  But where's the guy that brings her sunglasses?  Wow.  Hey.  I ruined it.  Well, you can put your clothes in.  Anthony.  What?  Anthony, you dick.  You dick.  Usually I call and break up these bullets, but you dick.  Hey, I ruined it.  Obscure reference.  I'm sitting here.  I'm spraying Florida, killing Jesse.  Bush wins.  Bush wins.  And O.J. shows up. 
[02:21:30]  I was ready to say you're the best, Anthony.  I love you, but you dick.  What did you do?  It was a perfect ending.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We might have an encore before we get out of here, okay?  Yeah.  I don't know if her body can handle it, though.  This is like scratches everywhere.  Hey, do you ever see the movie Seven?  Yes.  Yeah.  What about that contraption that guy was wearing for Lust?  Oh, yeah.  That was some pretty cool stuff.  You like that?  The big knife on the strap-on thing, and you just rip the girl in two? 
[02:22:00]  I wouldn't like dying.  No?  No, I'd prefer to stay alive.  You think you're not going to like the finale of this show?  All right.  Wow.  Everybody loved that, except Big Cat was a little disappointed.  Big Cat said it was sort of like watching a movie and then walking out on the end, because  he's used to maybe plunging the knife into a chest or something.  Right there, Kev?  Yeah, that's right.  It was a lot neater than I'm used to.  Yeah, see?  Should we do like a quick encore? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, quick encore.  What do you guys think?  Quick curtain call.  Got a little left in here or what?  Absolutely.  No problem.  The top looks okay.  I suggest gloves and a black hat.  Remember the coat?  Yeah.  And then give everything to Robert Kardashian.  And then take a plane to Chicago.  That's an OJ, man.  I think Jackie the Knife Girl and Rob are ready.  And Hot Wax Shannon Topless. 
[02:23:00]  Can she get in a little better position so when she leans over the camera isn't...  No, not you.  Oh, not you.  No, the one with the fine-looking chest.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Now she's got two knives working her body, Anthony.  Yes.  Make move.  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, everyone's mesmerized.  Dick.  Everyone, everyone jumped.  God damn it, that's funny.  What the hell, did we change roles today? 
[02:25:30]  You ruined it.  Oh, no. 
[02:26:00]  You ruined it.  You guys, let's hear it for Jackie the Night Girl.  Star of the show.  Star of the year.  I love it.  People probably have their radios turned up real loud in the car so they can hear it.  Good.  I would bet money that someone got in a fender bender over that.  What a performance, Star.  What a performance. 
[02:26:30]  I'm sitting in Los Angeles jail  And the judge won't let me post my bell  Now this could be the end of me  Cause California's got that death penalty  They're gonna electric shock, oh, Jay  Electric shock, oh, Jay  Toast my behind 
[02:27:00]  Nicole, I really loved that girl  But she had the worst look in the world  I was only cleaning my knife  I accidentally stabbed for 36 times  They're gonna electric shock, oh, Jay  Toast my behind  Like that cherry plummet 
[02:27:30]  Ooh  They're gonna electric shock, oh, Jay  Roast my behind  Looks like I'm a guilty man  Love got swimming  Now I'm gonna have to love my hand  Oh, what's worse  Don't make me flip my lips  I hear Michael Jackson is watching my kids 
[02:28:00]  Oh, I know they cut me some slack  I'm an athlete, movie star, and I'm black  While lawyers argue over my head  By baby warming up that electrical chair  Ooh  They're gonna electric shock, oh, Jay  Toast my behind  Like a flounder fillet 
[02:28:30]  Ooh  They're gonna electric shock, oh, Jay  Roast my behind  What?  Woo  Ow  Oh  I didn't do nothing  Ooh, that hurts  Hurts  Give me a car  Give me the hell out of here  What?  Woo  I wouldn't even need that  Woo  My hand  Wait, my hand's curling  Woo 
[02:29:00]  That hurt  What?  Don't make me flip my behind </pre>
