<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a satirical conspiracy theory about the bizarre initiation rituals for newly inaugurated presidents, involving exposure to government secrets like alien encounters and details of past presidential assassinations.  The bulk of the show then consisted of a series of listener phone calls featuring a parade of recurring characters, including "Believes Everything Other Radio People Say Guy," "Bringing Nothing to the Show Guy," "Beat a Joke to Death Guy," "Calling the Wrong Show Guy," "Gets Offended and Can't Take a Joke Guy," "Stone Guy," "I Want to Be a Character on the Show Guy," "Crash My Car Because the Show is So Funny Guy," "I'm Talking to the Phone Screener Guy," "Are You Trying to Be Suicidal and Only My Favorite Radio Guys Can Save Me Guy," "I Want to Provide Stuff for the Show Guy," "Call of the Show Totally Off-Topic Guy," "Gets Disconnected in the Middle of the Story Guy," "Lie Your Ass Off to the Call Screener Guy," and "Saying Hello and You Rule to People That Aren't There Guy." Opie and Anthony frequently interrupted and mocked these callers.

The conversation then shifted to a discussion of the changing depiction of nudity in movies, comparing modern films to those of the 1970s, leading to a segment focused on Russ Meyer's "Mondo Topless."  Numerous audio clips from the film were played, showcasing Meyer's distinctive, over-the-top narration and the film's topless women in various San Francisco locations. Opie and Anthony imitated Meyer's voice and vocabulary, and the segment concluded with a discussion about body hair preferences.  This "Mondo Topless" segment included further clips highlighting the announcer's flamboyant narration style and the dancers' brief, often nonsensical, interviews.  The hosts speculated about the announcer's identity and the possibility of a future interview. A listener called in to describe how the announcer's voice had become a recurring part of his daily thoughts.  The show also incorporated a soundbite of a skateboarder dramatically reacting to a broken arm and a humorous bit imagining a boxing match between a columnist and a "beast."

Finally, the show included a phone interview with Robert Clary of *Hogan's Heroes*.  Opie's repeated insensitive and offensive jokes about Clary's sexuality and Holocaust survival led Clary to hang up multiple times. Anthony repeatedly apologized for Opie's behavior.  Clary discussed his career and experiences in Nazi concentration camps before ultimately hanging up permanently.  The hosts expressed shock and remorse at Opie's actions and debated whether this was the worst segment in the show's history.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  The few times you do see them, so much time has gone by that you're like, what the hell? 
[00:05:00]  What happened to that guy?  Well, whenever you see pictures of or footage of the president in his first few days of office,  they look totally, they look totally, because all of their hair goes well, they go to the mountain and see the burning bush at some point during their presidency, come down with a shock of white hair.  I've seen God.  And you think something that happens, they take them to a room in the basement of the White House and say, here's what really goes on.  All right, here's everything. Oh, my God, that's true. Fill them in on all the seats. 
[00:05:30]  Tell them everything. Tell them everything. Okay, first, you have to drink some of Kennedy's blood.  Here's exactly who killed him. Here's the video of it. Yes, we had video back then.  Exactly. We'll take a break, we'll take lunch, and then we'll show you the alien.  And then you'll eat some poor people.  Yeah, eat poor people.  We'll show you the alien. We'll fly you around in the ship a little bit.  Yeah, exactly.  And then you come out and your hair's white, and you're just going, die, die. 
[00:06:00]  And here's proof there's no God. All right, well, you got four years. Have fun.  Yeah.  Have fun with it. Just talk about the economy and make a war if you have to, just anything.  Whatever you got to do.  But just keep all this stuff on the QT, because let me show you what happened to the last guy  that said he was going to say something.  Oh, we even got video of Abraham Lincoln getting assassinated.  Yeah, we had video back then. That was us, too.  We spun that nice.  And here's John Wilkes Booth, because we've figured out immortality.  Right, yes.  We have to keep him down here, because he'd just yap. 
[00:06:30]  That's a great way to look at it.  It is.  And they have white hair, they find out.  The white hair.  There's lizards running the country.  There's all this excitement.  You're going to be president of the United States.  Oh, totally.  And then they bring you down to the base.  Do you believe...  Wait, you actually think that the people voted you in?  What are you in?  Oh, okay, okay.  Come on.  Get in the elevator, you daffy bastard.  I think that's what happened to Bush.  Do you remember after 9-11?  First of all, he shows up the first time on camera in some weird place in Nebraska, 
[00:07:00]  looking like there's a guy with a gun to his head right off camera.  Right, yep.  Yeah, the hostage footage.  The next time we see him, he's crying a little, like his lip is quivering.  Yeah.  He's starting to, like, come unglued.  Because they told him, yeah, we did this.  It's just for money.  He ran the planes into the buildings.  We're just...  It's like busting out in a restaurant for insurance.  You had to.  And if I could hold this up...  Yeah.  You signed off on it.  Yeah.  Your signature at the bottom.  And then he showed up with a bandage on his head. 
[00:07:30]  Do you remember this?  This was right after 9-11.  Yeah, I believe they removed something.  No.  He had a bandage on his head, and they said the story was that he choked on a pretzel  and fell over and hit his head on a coffee table.  Which, if you've ever been in a writer's room or any kind of pitch room, that's a pitch.  That's people going around going, okay, how did he get...  Because what happened was he said, I'm telling everybody that you guys did this.  I'm telling them.  And Dick Cheney punched him in the face and said, shut up, you little bitch. 
[00:08:00]  Play along.  And then they all said, okay, what happened?  A pretzel.  Use the pretzel gag.  We're going to go with the pretzel.  And then Bush went to the mirror and started looking at his temples and going, it's white.  I swear this was just brown hair.  Oh, that's a great way to look at him.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On hold, we have Believes Everything Other Radio People Say guy.  Oh, yeah?  And this guy wants in.  Hi, who's this? 
[00:08:30]  Hey, what's up?  This is really boring.  Brings nothing to the show, guy.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I saw South Park the other day.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  I like South Park.  I'm a South Park fan.  I remember once I watched it with my sister.  Yeah.  And it was really funny because we were both watching it.  Yeah.  And we laughed.  And she laughed and I laughed.  And sometimes when she comes home from school, we watch a taste of South Park.  It's funny.  Oh, all right.  You're not really bringing anything to the show.  But I watch South Park.  And sometimes my mom watches it, too. 
[00:09:00]  And she watches.  And all three of us watch.  And it's really fun because it's like a family thing.  And we all watch it.  It's like really fun because South Park is funny.  You're totally, you bring nothing to the show.  What happened?  I thought I'm funny.  I'm not funny.  You're boring and you're not bringing anything to the show.  Oh, man.  Oh, but did I mention that I watched South Park?  Yes, you did.  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm sorry that I sucked today.  I'm sorry.  But I'll call back later with another story.  All right.  Well, great.  Thank you.  Bringing nothing to the show.  Oh, I apologize. 
[00:09:30]  Sorry.  There you go.  Guy?  Oh, goodbye.  He brought nothing to the show.  Absolutely nothing.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, I'm a be the joke to death guy.  No, we just had that guy on.  Yeah, look, I got my radio on and I'm boring and not funny like everyone else who calls  the show.  Look, my radio is on.  Ha, ha.  I'm at Roosevelt Field.  Look at me.  I am so cool.  Ha, ha, ha.  Beat a joke to death guy.  All right.  You're really beating that joke to death.  Hey, look, my radio is on.  I'm at Roosevelt Field waiting for you guys. 
[00:10:00]  Look, I can hear myself.  He, he, he.  Look at me.  I am so cool.  I can make Opie laugh.  He, he, he.  Listen, you're really beating the joke to death.  Yeah, enough.  But that's my job.  I beat jokes to death.  Look at me.  I am boring and not funny.  All right.  There he goes.  Beat a joke to death guy.  Man, a lot of people want to be a new character on our show, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's really annoying now.  Oh, my God.  Is this a brand new character for the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, we love new characters.  Who's this?  Hey, am I caller 100?  Uh, I think you might have the wrong station, sir.  Wait, I didn't get my big-ass card yet.  Oh, you're calling the wrong show, sir.  Yeah, I want to pledge 30 listeners from my office.  No, no, no, no.  You're calling the wrong show.  What about the Donna Summer tickets?  Uh, that's actually, that's kind of our show, but...  Eh, F Jackie.  All right.  See ya.  I think that was calling the wrong show guy. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  That could have been.  Yes, that was, uh, calling the wrong show guy.  I guess I should read this email from, uh, from, uh, who is this from, uh, nope, nope,  nope, nope.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Uh...  Oh, Breon.  Breon from Chicago, uh, from...  Breon from Philly.  Okay.  Guys, I tried calling today about 40 times and no one answered.  I mean, I'm listening to your show right now.  It's about midnight here in Chicago.  Come on, guys.  Answer the damn phone.  Syndication guy.  He wants to be syndication guy. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Syndication on delay guy.  Right.  All right.  Here's, uh, gets offended and can't take a joke guy.  What's up, bro?  Uh, hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I mean, really, I understand you guys are all about comedy, but with the homeless,  it's just not funny.  I mean, you guys don't understand what it's like to be homeless.  I used to work with the homeless.  It's just not funny, guys.  Don't you think, baby?  I mean, there's a line you don't cross.  But it was kind of funny to have them in a bunch of, a mall with a bunch of people.  No, no, no.  Guys, you really don't get it, do you? 
[00:12:00]  I mean, you really think that this is wasted.  No one's laughing.  No one finds this amusing.  It's really, you cross the line.  You get offended and can't take a joke guy.  I'm just offended.  And by the way, I'm also...  I'm assuming that you can't take a joke because you were once homeless.  Am I right?  Well, I, I, yes.  And I once worked with, and I also now work with the homeless.  I'm also pretty upset at South Park because they're blaming it on that Puerto Rican guy.  I work with a lot of Puerto Rican guys who are always accused.  It's just not funny because it's really sad when it happens, guys.  I'm sure I'll call you guys back later. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  It's gets offended and can't take a joke guy.  Yeah.  I don't like that character.  No, no.  You know why?  Because we had that guy on the phone so many times with different voices, different names.  But since we got here, believe me, enough calls from him.  Hi, who's this?  Hello.  Yo.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  It's Paul.  But I've got a character for the show.  All right.  Really stone guy who calls up with something that he thinks is really cool to say on the air  and then forgets everything he was going to say when you guys put him on the air. 
[00:13:00]  Stone guy, you're on the air.  What do you got, man?  I don't know.  Just hanging out at work.  No, you can't.  Sorry, BS.  Now you're a curse guy.  Hanging out at work doing a whole lot of nothing.  Your character sucks.  Your character sucks.  We didn't like yours.  His character sucked.  He was sucky character.  And you can't call up and say, I'm going to be such and such character.  You just got to be the character.  Be the guy. 
[00:13:30]  Don't you get it?  He's, I don't get the want to be a character on the show guy.  Oh, by the way, I don't answer to my name guys calling back.  Uncle John.  Hey, Uncle John, what's going on?  Uncle John.  Uncle John.  I hear something in the background.  John, you there?  Uncle John.  John.  Jim, what's his name?  It's Uncle John.  Uncle John, you there?  Hello?  Hello?  I hear something in the background.  Hey, if you're on the phone right now, say hi.  Say hi.

Well, now you're answering to Uncle John.  Who's Uncle John?  I'm Fred.  I think you might have.  Oh, that's it.  Very good.  Thank you, Uncle John.  But then he answered.  We caught him, Anthony.  Hey, I got a character.  All right.  I want to be a long-winded wow story without a point. 
[00:14:30]  You know, like the other day, I was driving downtown, 7th Avenue, and I wasn't sure which  way I was going to get out of the city, and it was Wednesday.  You know, Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Right.  And, you know, I was going to go through the Lincoln Tunnel, but then I thought maybe I'd  go through the Holland Tunnel.  And, you know, I was driving along, and I saw a blonde and a red convertible, but, you  know, she didn't wow me because she drove past me.  So, you know, instead I went through the Battery Tunnel because I realized I actually had to go out 
[00:15:00]  to Staten Island for something.  And, you know, there was another chick driving by.  She had a Volkswagen Cabrio Lake.  You know, it's real cute.  Georgia!  I don't think she saw my stickers.  Georgia!  And, you know, she didn't see me, but, you know, I was, like, still driving.  That's bad kid.  Oh, my God.  And then, you know, I said, all right, maybe I'll go to the mall because it's nice out.  Maybe some chicks will be out by the mall.  So, I was driving out to the mall.  Oh, this guy's a little too good.  Long-winded wow story without a point guy.  Thank you. 
[00:15:30]  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  We'll save you from the train.  You've got to just be the guy, though.  You can't say you're going to be, you know what I mean?  Right.  Exactly.  We go right to the phone, and you're the guy.  Just be the guy.  Just be the guy.  You don't have to announce it.  Makes it fun for everybody to guess what guy you are.  Right.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How you guys doing?  Hey, good.  Pretty good.  What do you have for the OPN Anthony show today?  Well, guys, let me let you guys know.  You know, every time I'm listening to you guys, like today, when you guys are talking  about that part, I drove my car right into a pole. 
[00:16:00]  It was so funny.  It was a hidden pole.  And the other day, when you guys went to the mall with those homeless guys, and I laughed  so hard, it crashed right into a pole.  I keep crashing my car.  You know, when that woman was licking Fanny Cain's clothes?  Yeah.  That's what I did.  Yeah.  It crashed right into a pole.  I'm going through cars like crazy listening to you guys.  I'm assuming that you're crashing my car because the show is so funny, guy.  That's who I am.  I'm the guy that crashes, I'm going through cars like crazy, guy.  He's crashing his car.  You know what?  I bet when I listen to myself right now, I'm going to laugh so hard, I'll probably hit 
[00:16:30]  another pole.  You're going to crash your car.  Yeah.  I'm going to crash my car.  No, I'm going to crash my car.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  Crash my car because the show is so funny, guy.  Yeah.  How many times have you heard that one?  Hi, who's this?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, who's this?  What's up, man?  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony.  No, no, no.  I mean, I called the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.

It's the...  Do you want to know what I want to talk about or what do I do now?  No, you're on the air, so now you should just say what you want to say.  Yeah, but I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Hello?  This is...  I think I'm still talking to the phone screener guy, Anthony.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  I think I'm talking to the phone screener guy.  Jerry, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what's going on? 
[00:17:30]  Hey, Jerry.  My life sucks, man.  What's the matter?  I'm thinking about taking it.  Taking what?  My life, man.  Yeah?  I can barely do it anymore.  What's the matter?  Are you depressed?  Just everything sucks, man.  You know, and I don't have an Xbox.  You don't have an Xbox?  Are you trying to be suicidal and only my favorite radio guys can save me guy?

We're talking about the contest tomorrow.  You don't call up with a GameCube comment.  Contest?  But, man, Xbox is advertising like crazy.  You're ruining the guy's bit because now he's on topic.  Yeah, true.  Sorry.  I'm going to Texas to listen to myself, guys.  All right, bye.  That's possible, though.

Hey, you're talking about the guy that delivered the guy that was in the Lost in Space robot suit.  Not the voice.  The guy that was in the suit.  Probably the best guest we've ever had on the suit.  And Dr. Smith, right?  Yep.  Joe, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, I'm an incredibly boring guy. 
[00:20:00]  How about your turn down the goddamn radio guy first, you tool?  I'm the guy that's going to turn down the radio because I'm the head-shaking news guy.  What is he talking about?  I don't know, man.  Unbelievably true head-shaking news guy.  Unbelievably true.  The stories that you just hear them and you just shake your head and say, I don't believe it.  So you're the unbelievably true head-shaking news guy?  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  I don't think that character's really going to take off.  Oh, my God.  You guys are going to wreck our bit, sir.  You're going to wreck our bit.  Yeah.  I don't think.  We need this bit to last another day or two.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He just was.  No.  I heard him.  No.  You did, too.  No.  Let's go to Peter.

I saw this car on the screen and everything. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And so I get out of my car and then I...  Hello?  Peter.  Peter, what happened?  We need to know the end of the story.  Peter?  Peter, is he gets disconnected in the middle of the story?  Yeah.  I think he...  Yeah.  Yeah, that was it.  But you're still connected.  You're supposed to hang up, I would think.  You have to have confidence in your bit.  It's ruined the bit guy, too.  You just ruined your own bit.  I tried.  He wanted to stay on the phone and he didn't want to make that supreme sacrifice of really... 
[00:21:30]  We don't hold for an hour.  You don't want to hang up right then.  All right.  I'll give him that.  We should have.  I mean, every day we do have that guy.  I've been on hold for two and a half hours, guy.  And I have nothing to say.  Chris, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just became lie your ass off to the call screener guy.  Why?  Why?  Sometimes you've got to do everything to get through, man.  You're lie your ass off to the call screener guy. 
[00:22:00]  So now you got through because it says on the screen that you're going to be representing New Orleans.  I don't hear a New Orleans accent.  He was up.  I didn't even have a phone number to give him.  He says he's up here with the military.  I smoked another one.  So you lied.  And now I'm on your show.  And you have nothing, though.  Hey, but I have a pot.  But now you're the character.  I'm the character.  Guy, that doesn't sound like he's from New Orleans. 
[00:22:30]  You get really tired of these new characters.  You guys rock, man.  All right, bye.  That's pretty funny.  That's funny.  Hi, who's this?  What's up, bro?  You've been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes.  Hey, Norton.  What's up, Norton?  No, Norton's not here today.  Norton, you rule, man.  No, Norton's not here today.  He has something to do.  Mario Cantone.  What's up, man?  Take your ball out.  No, it's Opie and Anthony.  No.  You waited an hour and 20 minutes to do this.  Brian Regan?  No, Brian Regan's tomorrow. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  All right.  I can't figure out who he is.  You guys suck.  Hold on.  I'm going to give you something for being on hold the longest.  Oh.  All right, thanks.  An hour and 20 minutes for that.  Adam Forrest.  No.  Adam.  Hold on.  None of those guys are here.  No.  Ben, what do we have for this guy?  Is this saying hello and you rule to people that aren't there, guy?  No, it is.  Okay, I think it is.  We have an Aerosmith prize pack for you, sir, all right?  You get that for being the guy on hold the longest today, all right?  Hey, boss.  No, no, no. 
[00:23:30]  Bits over.  Thank you.  Stop, boss.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to give you the prize.  That's for real.  Let's go to Oscar to start.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oscar, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I learned that today I just became.  I'm really getting sick of all these new characters, guy.  You're not alone.  And it really stinks, especially since I called in before as a can't-take-a-joke guy.  Take it easy, pressure.  He's two guys on the show, guy.  This is from guy who instant feedbacks what I learned today but doesn't get read as much 
[00:24:00]  as Dan from Hoboken, guy.  And he writes, today I learned, ah, why bother?  It's not going to get read.  Look at Steve P.  He says, Anthony is easygoing guy, except when he's explaining why he's easygoing guy.  Absolutely.  Hey, you're in your car going to work, and we're on vacation, so we rule. 
[00:24:30]  I don't want to endear us to the audience.  That's nice.  Who wrote this?  Speaking of Whip Him Out Wednesday, we got the Mondo Topless clips.  Yes, Mondo Topless.  Finally.  From the 70s, Russ Myers, man.  Yeah.  This guy was the guy in the 70s for putting out porno.  And it wasn't like the real hardcore porn.  It was kind of like he was trying to be.  Well, this predates porn. 
[00:25:00]  Well.  60s or 70s?  There was porn in the 60s and 70s.  This was early 70s, maybe late 60s.  Yeah, but porn was, you know.  Like bootlegging.  Yeah, it was, you know, 8mm film.  That you kind of like, you had to meet some dude on the corner in the middle of the night.  Right.  And he would hand you a brown paper package.  This was actual, you know, commercialized.  This is stuff you saw in theaters that played exclusively, you know, dirty movies. 
[00:25:30]  You know, the X-rated movies.  And they had like little stories or they weren't hardcore.  Not like now where it's, you know, you're going to be seeing some heavy duty work going on.  These are PG-13 now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like nothing.  Just bosoms.  It really is like PG-13.  Yeah, exactly.  Stan just did it.  It's like when a woman pushes her chest out and shakes it back and forth.  Yeah.  You know.  Ooh.  You know what, though?  I went and saw the new Will Ferrell movie last night, Talladega Nights, the story of 
[00:26:00]  Ricky Jones, whatever.  Ricky Bobby, Bobby Ricky.  Bobby Ricky.  Whatever.  Ricky Jones.  The movie was really, really funny.  Will Ferrell has another hit on his hands.  But I think we were saying this yesterday, how they've taken the breast shot out of movies.  Remember every movie you would go see, whether it was like almost like a Disney film up to  an R-rated, they always had to have that one scene.  Gratuitous breast shot.  Where the girl is just naked for no reason or topless for no reason.  And we were just discussing this yesterday, that they've pretty much taken that out of  the ballgame. 
[00:26:30]  You don't get the quick topless shot anymore.  No.  And in this movie, there's a scene where a girl is flashing Will Ferrell.  And this girl, I guess, becomes his wife.  I'm not giving much away.  Trust me.  But as she goes to flash, and the whole theater is expecting, all right, here it goes.  The topless shot that every movie has.  They go in.  They go in the back.  They go in for a close-up, and they just show her face as she's flashing.  And I'm like, man, we were just talking about this yesterday, how they've taken the breast 
[00:27:00]  shot out of movies.  Do you think, though, that that was done on purpose?  Because that sounds like something that's so annoying.  Like, you go, goddammit, why?  Like, they almost did that, like, on purpose.  To piss people off?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Just to be irritating.  It could be, because Will Ferrell likes to screw with you a little bit with his movies.  He's, you know, but I don't know, because we were just discussing how...  Animal House, Porky's...  Yeah, you get that fun, you know, scene of the girl...  Paddy Shack.  Hekid or Topless or something.  Who could forget Lacey Underalls.  Lacey in bed with Noonan. 
[00:27:30]  That was sexy.  Yeah.  Anyway, getting back to Mondo Topless.  So this is a Russ Myers film.  This is Smales in the Shower.  Loof of my stretch marks.  Loof of my stretch marks.  So, I found this Mondo Topless film years ago.  Yeah.  And we used that palaver drop in the intro.  Yeah, that's Russ Myers.  Actually, our new intro, we're not using it.  And it comes from Mondo Topless.  I heard it today.  This Russ Myers... 
[00:28:00]  Do we have it in the new one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I think it's become a staple, if I mind.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, Steve.  There was...  Eh, whatever.  So, we got more clips from Mondo Topless today.  And it kind of makes sense to play these today, because we're now being heard on Free  FM in San Francisco.  Yep.  And this...  He filmed his movies, a lot of them, in San Francisco.  Right.  And I guess, you know, back then, that's where you got your free-spirited women who were willing  to do this.  And they got Topless, and it's Russ Myers narrating. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, the whole movie's just girls, Topless, dancing to rock and roll music.  Yeah.  Bad old rock music, groovy music.  Fake rock and roll music.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't use the real rock and roll music.  He got huge with Super Vixens in the 70s.  That was, like, his movie.  And then when cable TV really was in its infancy, and they would show, like, the same movie over  and over again at night.  Well, they needed the soft porn.  Yeah.  Late at night, like, one in the morning, they would show things like Cheerleaders and Super 
[00:29:00]  Vixens, Last Tango in Paris, like, anything that had some type of porn in it.  They had really bad dubs, like, when the line had to be redone, like, where, like, they  didn't get sound from the room.  Oh, yeah.  So you'd be talking about something, and then you'd hear the voice, like, that obviously  didn't come from that mouth.  It wasn't that person.  Yeah.  It didn't matter, though.  But you'd sit there and, you know, flip over the big Cinemax switch or the cable switch  and turn a key.  It was like the big involved thing you had to do. 
[00:29:30]  Is that after Wameco?  Wameco Home Theater, WHT, the movie network.  You know, that was Cinema 100 out on Long Island, and you did.  You had this box with a switch on it and a key, and you have to turn the key, flip the  switch, and there you are looking at smut.  I gotta tell you, I am so distracted because E-Rock is playing the Vixen trailer.  You can find it on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  It is so erotic.  Erotic.  It really is nuts. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, there.  So, anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  No, no, I'm...  Russ Meyers' Vixen.  Vixen.  And then there was Super Vixens and Super Vixens 2.  He kind of put out a whole series.  Yeah.  But it was all just about very well-endowed women just having sex scenes.  It was great.  Right.  He got me through the early years.  All right, so why don't we play some clips from Mondo Topless. 
[00:30:30]  They're all short clips.  Well, Mondo Topless begins with girls just driving around Topless in San Francisco.  Yeah.  And they show some of the monuments of San Francisco.  And then I think it's Russ Meyers actually doing the voiceover.  He talks about these structures like they're some kind of sex object.  Everything he talks about has a little sexual twist to it.  And I can't get enough of the guy's voice.  I think it's hilarious.  He's so excited.  This guy is so into his work.  And that trailer is really sexy.  I'm telling you.  The women are sexy.  They are like voluptuous. 
[00:31:00]  They have large breasts.  They have really, really hips.  Really sexy.  They're very 60s and early 70s looking women.  And they got those bodies that were in fashion.  Full fun hairdos.  Yeah.  Before the anorexia and bulimic look becomes so much the rage.  You know they're not wearing business suits.  Like a girl you can pick your teeth with when you're done.  The type of girl that, you know, she wastes a meal right after you shove it down her throat. 
[00:31:30]  I like that.  I hate myself.  That a girl.  Wear a short skirt when you're vomiting out the car window.  I can have a little peeksy.  Just think of it as a celery stalk.  And it could throw up later.  You know, screw our radio show today.  There you go.  I repeated that because I stumbled.  Go to YouTube and just get the Russ Meyers trailers.  Because now I'm watching Beyond the Valley of the Dolls trailer.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was Beyond the Valley of the Super Vixens was another one.  They just got through Super Vixens.  Just throw Russ Meyers into the search engine of YouTube and you'll have fun this morning. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Here's Mondo Topless.  So here's Russ Meyers beginning of the film talking about the cable cars of San Francisco.  San Francisco.  San Francisco's bulging peaks and deep canyons lend themselves admirably to its own form of rapid transit.  The surging, swaying cable cars, death-defying and rampaging up and down Hill and Dale,  digesting and disgorging humanity at will. 
[00:32:30]  I love the piano, and that's my favorite part of that.  Yeah.  It's like an old silent movie piano playing in front of the screen.  He's talking about sex.  He's talking about girls that are well-endowed.  Pulsating over Hill and Dale.  This has nothing to do with the cable cars of San Francisco.  Yeah, he's trying to make cable cars sexy.  And he did.  And the hot rice-a-roni picture ad on the back.  Listen to what he has to say about Coit Tower.  San Francisco is a city of religious respect and authority. 
[00:33:00]  And democratically, there are those who are in disagreement.  San Francisco's art colony is dominated by the arrogant and imposing Coit Tower,  thrusting its bulk majestically to the sky,  with the Broadway tunnel offering a yawning orifice through which to enter fabled North Beach.  A yawning orifice.  Is he talking about tunnels and towers?  I think he's talking about some chick that's passed out cold. 
[00:33:30]  One of his vixens.  Yeah.  And then he finally starts getting into the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  Is there art to topless?  Yeah.  The way he puts it?  Uh, no.  The art of the topless.  That just didn't catch on, unfortunately.  All natural girls, too.  Yeah.  You won't find any implants in any of his movies.  They're all natural.  They're all fantastic, natural, like the big teardrops.  Yep.  Not a bee among them.  Very big.  And they run.  Yeah.  They play in the mud. 
[00:34:00]  They play in the mud in the dirt.  They're not afraid to get, like, their feet dirty.  They giggle.  Chuckle, chuckle, chuckle.  And they shake in a lovely fashion.  I love it.  Here's, uh...  Dirty horse.  The topless.  Dirty horse.  San Francisco.  A Spamoni-like hodgepodge of wild architecture, harboring wonderful old-world restaurants and  emporiums of pleasure.  Exploding from dust to dawn with the way-out craze of the topless.  Formed and nurtured by staid and stolid San Francisco. 
[00:34:30]  And cut loose to rampage across the USA and even Europe.  National publications such as Life, Playboy, and Esquire have documented the topless.  The phrase and the craze that is changing the mood and the mores of people everywhere.  The mood and the mores.  And the mores.  What was the opening line to that?  It was really great.  The something-something hodgepodge.  A Spamoni hodgepodge. 
[00:35:00]  It's like it's the hodgepodge.  San Francisco.  A Spamoni-like hodgepodge of wild architecture.  Harboring wonderful old-world restaurants and emporiums.  A Spamoni-like hodgepodge.  The year was this.  Like 1800s emporiums.  What does Spamoni mean?  Spamoni, I know, is some kind of Italian-like ice cream thing.  That's all I know.  He's got a lot of words in there I've never heard in my life.  Doesn't it? 
[00:35:30]  I don't like it.  We've got to imitate this.  I'm a bad guinea.  We've got to imitate this voice and do promos for our show with these way-out words.  It's a mix of different flavors.  Here's a...  We have to get different people because ours, you know, Spamoni-like hodgepodge.  That's not the way to do it.  Steve should take a lesson from Russ Meyer.  O-N-A.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get a show on the road.  Get a show on the road.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:36:00]  That's palaver.  I'm sorry.  Here he describes the Mondo Topless movement.  Mondo Topless captures the basic quintessence of the movement.  With movement.  Way out.  Wild movement.  Here, go-go girls, in and out of their environment, will be revealed to you in scenes that can only  be summarized as a swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Mondo Topless is believably real in Eastman color. 
[00:36:30]  But unbelievable just barely describes all of Russ Meyer's discotheque discoveries.  Fantastic women.  Fantastic dances.  Featuring the world's loveliest boxatics.  You've only dreamed there were women like these until now.  But they're real.  Unbelievably real in Mondo Topless.  He is worked up, man.  He is psyched about his movie.  He's frothing.  He loves his job. 
[00:37:00]  It's Mondo Topless.  Is it him doing the announcing, we think?  Yeah, it is.  It has to be.  Yeah, somebody checked on IMDb.  B-Rock is killing me.  I'm just watching Russ Meyer trailers from YouTube.  Aren't they great?  Buck-Sotics.  Oh, my God.  Buck-Sotics.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but it's all I want to say from now on.  Buck-S...  That girl is quite Buck-Sotic.  Well, they're Buck-Sotics, the two of them.  I mean, they're busty.  Well, this is where it gets really good.  He starts introducing the girls.  I think on the walkover today, I'm just going to talk to all the people on the street like 
[00:37:30]  Russ Meyer.  Let's do that.  How are you today, you Buck-Sotic?  Welcome to this palindrome of pleasure.  Enough of this palaver.  Where are you going?  That's right.  Whore.  Enough of this palaver.  Why don't you walk on the road?  Did you take...  No.  I couldn't think of anything we'd say outside, so I bothered.  Did you take the bridge or one of the slippery, lubricated tunnels until Manhattan?  Until Manhattan.  Until... 
[00:38:00]  There's nothing worse than when you took and sustained an injury, and while your friend  is laughing at you, he also hurts himself.  I fell and injured myself over my own words.  All right, here we go.  Cool.  The introduction of the ladies.  Feast your eyes on functious Pat Barringer, buxotic Darlene Gray, luscious Sin Lanet, delicious  Dollar Paris, yummy Diane Young, exciting Donna X, and bouncy Babbitt Bardot. 
[00:38:30]  Yes, for the very first time, you will hear actual on-the-spot recorded tapes consisting of  sensitive comments and opinions by the very topless dancers wildly gyrating before your eyes.  Pearls of wisdom based upon guarded personal experiences all played against a backdrop of  compestuous, soul-stirring rock-and-roll music. 
[00:39:00]  Classic.  Can I say my favorite part of that whole thing is that there's a stripper named Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington.  That's the worst name for a stripper ever.  I'm Pat Barrington.  I got to help you.  Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington.  By the way, all these clips are from the first ten minutes of the film.  Yeah.  And it's just pictures of San Francisco and topless women chasing each other around, dancing,  shaking.  With just beautiful, perfect cones.  Yeah, like untouched by silicone or anything like that. 
[00:39:30]  Natural girls.  Is he in the rest of the movie, too?  He's never in the movie.  No, not me, but the narration.  His narration.  Oh, yeah.  Through the whole thing.  Yeah, it goes out through the whole thing.  And look at this one.  The movie goes on for, I don't know, I've never gotten to the end of the film.  No, you rarely do.  As soon as you've got to go for a towel, it's time to stop.  That's it.  You don't hit pause, you hit stop.  Hit stop.  Hit stop on the tape and on on the shame.  As cleanup time begins.  A friend of mine, I was talking one time about when you know I was trying to put that part 
[00:40:00]  of your addiction away.  He goes, you know, one time I was in my parents' house and I was 30 and I was shuffling with  my pants around my ankles to the bathroom and I'm like, what am I doing?  All right.  Yeah, you sometimes give a thought like, ah, come on, enough's enough.  Because the high is over, that moment of clarity is there.  You can only touch the doorknob with one hand and you're like, what am I doing with my life?  This is cute when you're 18.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. 
[00:40:30]  Damn, that's funny.  Here's where we got the palaver drop.  But enough of this palaver.  Palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Reving up on runway number one is Bumpuous Pat Barringer.  A magnificently configured female skilled in the art of the topless.  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say.  She's so skilled in the art of the topless that it's just wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, 
[00:41:00]  coming out of her mouth.  Even Rush knows it.  She's a blathering idiot.  It's Russ knows what guys want.  Oh, that Pat Barrington, you just can't concentrate on the words.  Pat Barrington.  It's the greatest stripper name ever.  This guy just loses his mind.  How many Pat Barringtons are going to turn up on the message boards now?  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  It's only a man's name, but it's a bland man's name.  Yeah, it's awful.  Hi, Pat Barrington, here to close that big deal.  Are you?  Dan, you're going to have to get more drops. 
[00:41:30]  You're going to have to.  We love Rush Meyer.  We have, like, five more drops.  They're all really quick.  It's him just introing each girl.  Each girl.  So that was Pat Barrington or whatever.  Yeah, Barrington.  Barrington.  Barrington.  Well, here he introduces Darlene.  Ah.  Ready to entertain you as buxotic Darlene Gray.  England's answer to the biggest and the best.  What do you say, Darlene?  He, like, turns around and asks her, what do you say, stupid whore? 
[00:42:00]  And, of course, these girls just have nothing to say.  Bill from Waterford.  How is someone skilled in the art of the topless?  I know.  That's what we've been saying.  The beauty of him.  Like.  It's great how he uses his words.  The art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  He's a stripper.  The art of being topless?  No.  The art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  I've studied the topless for many years.  I'm quite skilled in the art of the topless.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Here's the intro for Sin.  And away we go with luscious Sin Lene.  Self and lithesome.  Give us a word, Sin.  Sin.  Lithesome.  Give us a word.  He's just in heaven.  Yeah.  He's just in heaven.  Guy was a filthy man making a living.  Here's Darla.  Try to follow delicious Darla Paris vivaciously voluptuous.  Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea. 
[00:43:00]  His old World War II lingo.  That's right.  Kilroy was here and here on these voluptuous ones.  Now we show you a woman who looks like she's got two Kaiser helmets on her chest.  And all the ships at sea. 
[00:43:30]  He's great.  And under her shirt are two Jews who start all the wars in the world.  Hey, at the ONA Traveling Virus, we're going to be in Worcester Saturday, DCU Center.  Is there any way we can play Mondo Topless as people are coming in?  This Saturday.  I mean, how does that work?  Your wish is my command.  Whatever you want.  What do you guys think?  He's a genie now.  We're going to have big screens there, right?  Big stupid lamp he's got to crawl into.  I can't fit.  My leg won't go in. 
[00:44:00]  His head goes right in.  His head goes right in.  It slips right in.  A tiny head.  My nose will get stuck.  We're going to have the big screens there, right?  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Can we play this?  Just have it playing as people are filing in before the show?  Just ask to make sure that they can show that.  I don't think it's anything that dirty, to tell you the truth.  No frontal nudity.  No, the girls aren't bottomless.  Topless.  It's the art of the top.  By frontal nudity, I think they usually mean some kind of bottom thing going on. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, let's find out.  I think topless is kind of okay.  All right.  I'll get an answer for you.  We'll work on it.  Yeah, I mean, they don't even, yeah, these girls are not bottomless.  I'll get on my magic carpet.  Your wish is my command.  It's just.  It could be really funny to have playing.  Yeah.  As people are filing in.  Kenny has the driest hair I've ever seen.  It's like, I wash it. 
[00:45:00]  I'm not saying it's not clean, but it's just.  Do you use a conditioner?  Yeah, it's all in one.  Ah, see.  That doesn't work.  Good old pert.  Yeah.  Doesn't work.  And then.  Are you that, like, pressed for time?  You can't throw another, like, batch of.  He doesn't even rinse it.  He just puts it in his hair and leaves without even a shower.  It's all bubbly as he's driving down the highway.  Bubbles popping.  I'm very good on time management.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Find out about Mondo Topless.  Taste makes waste.  Good point, Ken. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you.  Write that down.  That's a keeper.  You think he has nothing to say?  It's a gem like that.  I'm going to finish up here with Russ Meyer.  Here he is introing Diane.  Settle back and let yummy Diane Young entertain you.  Blondely beautiful.  And while you're about it, lend her your ear.  Yeah.  I want to hear what some of these girls have to say.  Because I'm sure it's worthless babble.  Well, that could be the next thing we do.  Yeah.  Because they talk about their toplessness.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  The art of the topless.  That's not a bad idea.  Relax and enjoy exciting Donna X.  Juno-esque of proportion.  Listen closely to what she has to say about topless.  About topless.  Juno-esque.  He's losing it.  Juno-esque.  He's running out of adjectives.  Is he?  And finally, this is the last one for today.  Hang on, men.  And zero in on bouncy Babbitt Bardot. 
[00:46:30]  Babbitt.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babbitt baby.  And he finishes strong.  Best one.  50-50 where it counts.  French and Swedish.  Yeah.  That's good because the French are known for, you know, their mouths.  Right, right.  And I guess the Swedes are known for anything below the waist. 
[00:47:00]  But they should have thrown a little Greek in her, I think.  Hey, let's hear that again.  33 and a third where it counts.  Let's hear this one again.  Hang on, men.  And zero in on bouncy Babbitt Bardot.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babbitt baby.  Babbitt baby.  Love that guy.  Oh, he's a really good egg.  We've just touched the surface.  That's the first 10, 15 minutes of the film, basically. 
[00:47:30]  It goes on.  I've never seen the end of the film, so maybe we can see what...  Maybe we can all watch it together later.  What all the hubbubs about.  I'm telling you, as people file into the ONA Traveling Virus, it can be fun to have on the huge screen.  I'd go to a reading that he was doing.  No kidding.  It's the ONA Virus spreading across America.  WXRK New York.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The worst. 
[00:48:00]  O.B. and Anthony.  I know.  But back to Mondo Topless.  The art of the topless.  We get to say hi to Babbitt Bardo.  Babbitt Bardo.  Hang on, men, and zero in on bouncy Babbitt Bardo.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babbitt baby.  I try to project a childlike to a woman quality because I do believe that men, they're not like so much odd sex. 
[00:48:30]  They like softness also.  So I try to project both sexuality and also gentleness.  So I do always start my act more or less in a very gentle way.  You know, any one of these girls, you'd have to, foreplay, you'd need a machete.  Because we all know what the style was back then.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Au natural.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's Babbitt Bardo.  I hate when they don't shave.  You don't like that?  It stinks.  It's coming back.  Not in my life, it's not.  I see one hair, it's duct tape.  Really?  Absolutely.  Everything old is new again.  Yeah.  It's coming back around.  It's back in style.  It's coming back around.  Eek.  No, the hair is never coming back. 
[00:49:30]  Get rid of it.  It's got to be well trimmed, but I'm not offended by any hair.  It was here for 10,000 years.  But leave it for a little while.  How about that?  It was in for 10,000 years to be unshaven chimps.  How about giving us a break, would you?  How about that?  Legs, armpits.  Everything.  Just shave everything.  I don't mind hair on the armpits as much.  What?  Now that.  Now your argument. 
[00:50:00]  Out the window.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  I don't touch the armpits.  Yeah, but you see it.  Who cares?  I'm saying if a woman's going to have hair anywhere, if I had to choose.  I'd prefer she doesn't, but that would be the least offensive to me.  Armpit hair is least offensive.  Compared to legs or everything else?  Yes.  Because I don't touch the armpits.  Oof.  Yeah, but you've got to look at the whole picture.  Aren't you a visual guy?  Very much, but the armpits don't capture a lot of my attention.  Oh, my God.  It just would take me out of the game.  They had a one-hand.  They would completely take me out of the game.  But your head's kind of up there during certain acts. 
[00:50:30]  If you're yourself.  So it's during certain acts.  It's kind of up in that area of face-to-face, face-to-shoulder.  How would you even go?  Things like that.  So if you see a little tuft coming out from under an armpit, it's just going to be a turnoff.  I'm not into that.  In some cases, yeah, but in some cases it wouldn't bother me.  Am I insulting somebody you know?  Not at all.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  Everybody I know in my life.  I just want to make sure.  Let's just say, no, no, no.  It looks like someone just took an infant and lifted their arms up and said, look at 
[00:51:00]  these pits, kiddo.  Steve, you shave under your arms, too?  Waxes.  No.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Hold the fuck.  We all know Steve likes to be clean.  Squeaky clean.  I don't like all the body hair, so I need to get rid of it, especially when I have to  get the tattoo finished.  I get it.  I have to shave that armpit.  Hairy Lebanese, usually, but you shave down a little bit your arms and stuff.  The arms.  I did the chest a couple times.  Sometimes it's really irritating because you have to, I go through about two or three 
[00:51:30]  razors when I do it.  Two or three razors.  Two or three razors for one shaving?  Of my chest, yeah.  Ew.  Yeah.  How hairy are you?  Extremely.  Let me see.  Yeah, you could see like that, that probably grows in like a carpet.  Yeah.  It's the whole thing.  Jesus.  It's on the sides and everything.  Dude, it's everywhere.  I'm Italian and Lebanese.  That's the worst combination to have.  You're this close to being like that werewolf kid.  The werewolf kid.  We saw him on the news recently.  You're really close. 
[00:52:00]  How high does your hair go up on your face?  About mid-cheek?  Well, yeah.  I could kind of see mid-cheek.  That's not bad, though.  And then from, let me see, down from the bottom of your beard to your chest hair.  It's completely connected.  Yeah, it's completely connected.  If I let it go, it would be completely connected, as would my hairline and my eyebrows.  It would be completely connected.  His hairline and his eyebrows and his beard and his chest hair.  Do you shave your forehead?  What?  No, it's like right here where my eyebrows would go.  They do this weird thing when I go to the barber. 
[00:52:30]  They take a piece of string, some kind of diamond, and they just tear your hair out by the roots.  What kind of diamond?  What the hell are you talking about?  I've had it done a couple times.  It hurts like a bitch.  It's a special string.  And is it sticky?  No.  The string isn't sticky, but somehow it pulls the hair.  It makes like a knot.  It makes like a knot.  I kind of think I know what you mean.  It makes like a cat's cradle kind of thing.  And then he just yanks it in one direction, and it uproots a whole bunch of hair.  It could be like wax string or something like that, for all I know.  Why don't you just use wax? 
[00:53:00]  Wax strips.  I've done that, too.  I just use a little scissor.  If you push up on your eyebrow, like above your finger, they'll all pop up.  And the ones that are bigger, you just kind of go...  Why don't you just use a pistol?  All right.  Let's get back to the...  Yeah, but that won't.  Let's get back to the art of the topless.  We get to say hi to...  I don't know who this is, actually.  Let's see what this is about.  Sure, she's buxom.  It's the type of audience that finds more enjoyment from a dancer than you give them dancing.  If they find more enjoyment from slower movements and more suggestive movements than you give them that. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, she's explaining her, the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  At least they're talking about actually dancing.  How about we do one of these updated now?  Mondo topless for this century.  I don't know.  I'm working to, you know, just go...  I'm trying to get money for school.  I don't know.  I'm just going to stand here and not dance.  I'm going to squat down and talk to guys. 
[00:54:00]  Get up and dance.  Get up and dance.  Show us the art of the topless.  Get to the pole, bitch.  Strippers bug me.  Hate them.  The horny moves.  Hate them.  He he he he he he.  Shut up.  Just cannot stand that...  They have forgotten the art of the topless, Hopi.  Yeah.  I do believe strippers of this day and age, it's all about, give me 20 bucks so I could  sit in your lap.  The art of the grabbing your cash. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Big dumb implants.  No sex appeal at all.  Their lap dances are awful.  One more stupid hair over the lap thing.  I'm going to rip it out by the root.  Wouldn't that be great?  Just grab a big handful of bleach blonde hair and pull out two big fists.  Yeah.  You just got blonde hair wavering as a big bouncer punches your face in.  But as he's pulling you out, you refuse to let go?  Yeah.  Dragging her.  So she's being dragged out?  All right.  Here's the bimbo talking about personality.  Well, I feel that personality has a lot to do with it and I think that I have been able 
[00:55:00]  to present a personality that is a little different than a lot of girls have.  She's sexy, man.  Is she?  Yeah, she's sexy for a voice.  Yeah, a voice.  Well, this next girl, she says she's full of the devil.  She's full of the devil.  The devil.  And it influences her art of the topless.  The topless is quite different from the exotic field because there I am vivacious and alive 
[00:55:30]  and full of the devil.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm sometimes vivacious in my exotic work also, but there are two different type of moods  entirely, where in the exotic field, everything is done with slow, enticing movements and a  teasing type form, where in my topless, I am just vivacious and full of warmth and like  we'd like to have some fun.  So the art of the topless is different than being a stripper. 
[00:56:00]  It's like whore exhibit A and B.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess they could rationalize going home and sleeping a little easier with the topless  than the exotic.  Well, when I'm in the topless, I'm disappointing my parents this way.  And in the exotic, I'm humiliating them publicly that way.  Oh, I see.  I think the exotic, dad puts the shotgun in his mouth.  The exotic.  The topless, he just tries not to make eye contact with the neighbors or any friends. 
[00:56:30]  Or he feels guilty for whatever he did that made you do this for a little bit.  Right.  Right.  Exotic.  Daddy did something to you.  The art of the topless.  That uncle did something to you.  Your uncle did once, but he was from out of town, so he didn't have enough opportunities  to ruin you for life.  There you go.  Back to the voiceover guy.  What must a girl possess to measure up as a topless dancer?  She must have a body well above the average in physical beauty, unblemished by an uneven 
[00:57:00]  suntan, together with a bust line that is firm and youthful.  The topless dancer's face as well must bear an equal burden with the body, encouraging  sensuous and provocative expression, supplementing her physically exciting figure.  Wow.  Exciting figure.  Guy does know.  Hey, you know this guy that did the voiceover apparently is still alive.  Yeah.  We got to get him on the phone.  Get him. 
[00:57:30]  It's going to be one of those bad interviews, though.  Book it.  You mean me?  Yeah.  We had an interview one time with a guy that did cartoon voices for everybody.  Yogi Bear, Ranger Smith.  You mean me.  Ricochet Rabbit, like all that genre was all this guy.  And we were very excited to have him on our show when we were in Worcester, Boston.  And he got on and, oh my God, he was senile.  We're asking him, you know, hey, could you just do some Ricochet Rabbit?  What do you mean me? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What else do you think we're talking about, you idiot?  Then he passed away very shortly afterwards.  Yeah, it was a very uncomfortable interview.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the last interview.  All right.  Here's the last clip for today.  Mondo Topless, voiceover guy, introing another girl, but there's no voice of this girl.  So you'll just hear a really, just another fantastic intro by this guy. 
[00:58:30]  Love him.  Completely topless, completely uninhibited, this way out craze that began in San Francisco  has now vaulted across the ocean to Europe.  Every sin sinner has embraced this swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Let's jet to Belgium and look in on the famed Moulin Rouge,  where the buxom bombshelled Veronique Gabrielle performs her heady,  hedonistic dance of the leather belt.  An incendiary art calculated to ignite the flames of passion within the male spectators. 
[00:59:00]  Her fabulous figure is the envy of women and the delight of men.  There is no one better.  Whoever wrote this is brilliant, by the way.  Yeah, that is great writing.  Incendiary.  Incendiary.  Right.  Oh, wow.  From San Francisco to Europe.  Kind of a long way around.  Yeah.  Shouldn't it sweep the country first?  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  It probably took a loop around Canada. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, okay.  Passed right by those boring Canucks.  I'm sure it skipped like Iowa.  Or to the topless, eh?  Yeah.  And there you go.  That's it for today.  Mondo topless.  We'll have more in the coming weeks.  Love him.  Got to get him.  See if he still is alive.  We'd love to have him.  I have to tinkle.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Steven asks from Bayshore, you guys realize that all those Bucsonics are now in their 60s.  Yeah.  Ugh.  There's not much bounce left.  The art of the saggage. 
[01:00:00]  It's bouncing off their knees.  Wonderful.  I defy you to a listen to a word she says as an orderly as changing her diapers.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Let's talk about the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  Volume three.  Possibly ten volumes.  Really?  Yeah, that's a lot.  At least another three, right?  Yeah, I'm halfway through.  We're still looking for this guy, too? 
[01:00:30]  I hear the search is on because the guy that did the narration for this is still alive.  And boy, would we love to talk to him.  The art of the topless.  Dave from Phoenix.  He might be a new listener.  He was naked in front of Opie.  What the F does that queer want?  A gay porn involving you two with no homo at the end?  Hmm.  Good point.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  All right, Mondo topless. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, it's one of these videos that were out in the 70s.  This was porn.  This was porn back then.  And it was just, it's pretty much women dancing topless.  Some nude, but they kind of cover up their naughty bits with little prop items.  One is one of those hand warmers that women would carry around.  You ever see those things?  They're like rabbit fur, and they look like a big yodel, and you'd stick your hand in each end to keep your hands warm. 
[01:01:30]  And they call it a muff.  You ever see those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And one woman is covering her naughty bits with this hand-warming muff and talking about it.  And that's supposed to be like sexy.  That was porno back then.  And they're topless.  You could go deeper to find like hardcore stuff.  It doesn't matter what year you lived in.  Yeah.  But as far as like going to the theater and stuff, this was porno. 
[01:02:00]  You think they had porno in like 1830?  You have never seen some of that stuff?  Well, not 1830.  Every once in a while you...  Paintings.  No.  Well, early, early...  I've seen the early...  1900s and stuff.  1900s and like classic porno.  Well, who did that?  I guess Hustler used to put in a picture or two from classic porn, they'd call it.  And you'd see like...  Porn over the years or whatever.  Some guy with like a big curly mustache.  And they're all wearing masks.  And he's just...  Some woman.  Yeah, yeah.  Hardcore style too.  And you're like, whoa, they were doing this back then. 
[01:02:30]  She's got that Miss Crab tree from The Little Rascal's hairdo.  Only problem, the sex would be in fast motion.  Of course.  Whole thing would take 10 seconds.  What's this?  Great stuff.  It's still porn.  So even though Mondo Topless was the thing to do in the late 60s, early 70s,  you could go deeper to find the rank stuff.  Was he trying for a documentary with this?  Some kind of documentary on the topless dancing craze? 
[01:03:00]  Maybe he had to pass it off as art or as an expose.  Yeah, maybe that way so he wouldn't be labeled a pornographer.  I think he was saying bodacious baby.  Baby.  Lovely babette.  Are you ready for Mondo Topless Volume 3?  Please.  So for the new listeners, well, basically, it's just girls topless with this over-the-top  announcer describing what's going on.  And then they get to speak a little bit and what they say is just so thrilling.  Well, the trouble with the pasties. 
[01:03:30]  The pasties.  We'll start here.  Listen to this.  To wear pasties, you know, you have to put on all that glue.  And it's so hard to get off.  And sometimes the pasties slip.  And then the glue shows.  Sometimes they fall off.  That's terrible.  Don't be broad.  Sometimes they fall off.  That's terrible.  I like that as a woman, though. 
[01:04:00]  Like, that's the type of woman I want to date.  It is.  Just a 34D and a dope.  A complete idiot.  A big dummy with a little waist.  Babbling buffoon.  Huge bosoms.  Who does nothing but stand there with her hands in front of her privates.  Pat Barringer.  Just an ass.  A complete idiot.  What are you doing?  Challenging myself to listen to a word you say.  You're an adult.  It's hard to hear you.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:04:30]  This fine performer of the art of the topless.  Yes.  Didn't need to wear a bra in junior high.  And she has to tell everyone about.  Oh, please.  Love her.  I like men.  Well-built men.  Skinny, scrawny men.  No.  But he men.  Look like men.  And I don't like the long hair look at all.  I can't stand guys around with long hair. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't really need to wear a bra until I was halfway through junior high school.  It all came late, but it was there, boy.  No denying it.  That's so dumb.  Wonderful.  All right.  We'll get the announcer on.  I need a copy of this movie.  It's great.  I have to see this.  I was telling the guys in the office today, I've seen the first half hour about 20 times.  I want a copy of this today.  Please.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  Here we go.  Please.  A topless dancer must always concern herself with more than one angle of view.  Exposing her body as she must in Go-Go Discotheque, she must attractively present herself  to the many eyes of her admirers.  Go-Go Discotheque.  What the hell is that?  She's going to look good from every angle?  Yeah.  Is that it?  She can't have like a shotgun wound to her back?  It's the art of the topless. 
[01:06:00]  Art of the topless.  That's what makes it an art.  You've got to be able to show all angles.  Topless.  Well, they're not going to dump out if I say t***, right?  No.  I hope not.  Who knows, though, these days?  Foreign woman not allowed to t***.  Yeah.  She explains this in this clip here.  For example, you have the pelvic movement, which excite a man quite a lot.  But just you can't go too close to a person.  You have to stay in the middle of the stage. 
[01:06:30]  But actually, a very slow and sensuous movement from the pelvic will excite much more men than  hard bumps and grind.  This I've always found.  And then, naturally, if you, you cannot touch your bust at all.  But if I want with very, like, carest a bust, this would excite a man, I believe.  But you cannot do this on the stage.  Shouldn't she be telling people just to go on that their belongings will arrive separately?  It was moose and squattle.  Right.  Well, she's talking about the man. 
[01:07:00]  I thought she was talking about how she can't when she's doing art of the topless.  But she's talking about the horned up dudes in the audience trying to touch whatever they can.  They're trying to get a slap of flesh.  Trying to grab.  And some things never change.  Of course not.  Because you see that at the club all the time.  And a guy sitting there trying to get a grab.  And then the bouncer's got to come over and set him straight.  Have some respect for the ladies.  Yeah, shut up.  Unlike herself and her entire family.  Good point.  Stupid strippers. 
[01:07:30]  Some.  A little hat dance.  Shut up.  Some men want to get involved.  The women become very jealous, which is natural.  But they realize, I think the woman is smarter than the man.  Because the woman realizes that it's only a dance.  And it's only a form of entertainment.  Whereas the man, the male, becomes too...  We get it.  Possibly his imagination runs away with him.  And he thinks that, oh, isn't this wild?  And he has visions of becoming involved with the person. 
[01:08:00]  The man is smart because you spend your whole life trying to be demure and to be a lady.  And he goes, here's a buck.  And your shirt comes off.  That's stupid.  All those lessons your parents taught you.  Here's a buck.  And the shirt comes off.  Can't get past the fact she really thinks it's an art form.  Yeah.  And that women understand this. 
[01:08:30]  But some guys want to get involved.  In their imaginations.  And their imaginations are going wild.  And back when this thing was made, you know it was a buck.  That was it.  These girls are dancing around for a dollar.  Period.  That's it.  Now, you know, you get these girls, even in the local stupid strip clubs around your local little town.  That used to just be, you know, overpriced beer.  But a dollar would get you, you know, a dance in front of you or something like that.  Now even they're trying to fancy it up. 
[01:09:00]  20 bucks they want for a lap dance.  It's a corner gin mill.  Yeah.  It's a corner gin mill strip club.  You're not like a gentleman's club, so stop it.  I hate those cabaret places.  I've never been in one of those cabaret places, like the higher class ones, where anything sexy has ever happened.  No.  The girls are way too hot.  But they're like plastic, not attractive, hot.  You can't touch them at all.  Their lap dances stink.  They're overly perfumed with glitter.  It's like, oh, buzz off. 
[01:09:30]  You want really good looking regular girls.  That's what you want.  Good looking, hot, regular girls.  Not over-the-top stripper girls.  For the art of the tablers.  And in your corner strip club, stop trying to charge 20 bucks for a table dance.  Table dances suck.  One dollar, don't stand over my bottle of beer.  That's got to be, I remember, like, when I used to work for a living, I used to go to the strip clubs for lunch. 
[01:10:00]  A lot of times, a lot of the guys on the job sites, we'd go to the strip clubs.  And one thing I remember, which had to be so degrading to the girl, when she's walking along the bar, trying to get a buck from everybody, and the guys would just kind of slowly put their hand over the top of their beer as she would step over each drink.  And then, you know, you pull your hand back.  As Bob Seger's playing.  Yeah.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  No, that was for the rug act, where she would take her quilt from her bed from junior high and, like, spread it out on the stage and do the rug act, where she would lay down and do something to a slow little ballad. 
[01:10:30]  The sad part about the...  Who needs tomorrow?  The sad part about the rug act, you know, Grandma, like, quilted that for her.  Oh, yeah, made the quilt when she was in junior high, maybe turned 13 or something.  Or she has, like, an old Wonder Woman one that she turns upside down so you don't see the Wonder Woman on it.  She's had it for years.  Why did you handle this?  Because it looks like me? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  No, it looks like me.  No, see?  Really?  This is porn from the ages.  Classic porn.  But she looks like me, with the hand behind her.  Look at her face.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Jim with a wig on.  Jimmy with a wig on.  And, you know, I was just going to say, she's kind of, like, hot if you chop her head off.  She looks like...  Oh, my God.  ...like me, with, like, an awful, like, an 80s hairband wig.  Oh, my God.  That's what I would look like if I sang in Winger. 
[01:11:30]  Can we get this on the website?  That is hysterical.  Yeah.  It's Jimmy with the Quiet Riot wig.  That's the guy's wig.  Moody Sarzo.  We need this on the web with the split screen of Jimmy Norton, because that is your face.  But there you go.  Porn from the ages.  This has got to be, like, the turn-of-the-century porn.  That's disturbing, because her body isn't really that bad.  But then, with the Jimmy face and the 80s hairband wig... 
[01:12:00]  Man, no muscle tone, though.  That's great.  I like that.  No muscle tone.  That's good.  She's a little sloppy.  That was in.  But she had, like, a juicy body.  Like, a really feminine body.  Back then, they didn't know about working out or anything.  They didn't know what carbs are.  I'm trying to lose weight, so I'm only eating bread.  Oh, okay.  The Nautilus was just some wacky ship that sailed the seas 20,000 leagues under it.  All right.  We're working on getting that up on...  Excuse me?  ...the website there.  Never against crashing myself for a bad reference. 
[01:12:30]  Let's say hi to Josh in New Jersey.  Josh, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Josh.  I've got to tell you that ever since you guys have been playing this Russ Meyer stuff,  I've got a running commentary of this guy in my head all day long.  Oh, you can't get enough of this guy.  When I get up, it's ridiculous.  Like, watch Darlene as she makes a PowerPoint presentation.  It's just ridiculous.  Yeah, the voice is in your head.  I've said Pat Barrington many, many times in the last week or so.  All right, Josh.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Speaking of the announcer, here's another little thing from him. 
[01:13:00]  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, a Nordic nymph whose paltitude is unrivaled by any showgirl in...  Her what?  I don't know.  I couldn't get past...  Greta Thorwald.  Holy shit.  Wait, I've got to start this over.  He came up with a new name for boobs. 
[01:13:30]  The...  What?  I love this guy.  Listen closely and tell me what the word was.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, a Nordic nymph whose paltitude is unrivaled by any showgirl in Denmark.  Paltitude.  Her youthful bosom, flat stomach, firm hips, and smooth, lithe legs all seem to unite in her wildly exotic dance, which she delivers in a burst of uninhibited frenzy. 
[01:14:00]  Greta Thorwald.  That could be the new name.  That could be the new name.  I love Greta.  How do you not love it?  The Dormwalds are here.  She's life.  He loves that word, too.  Life.  Yeah.  What is she called?  The Danish nymph?  Did he say...  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic...  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic nymph.  The Nordic nymph.  Oh, is this terrific.  Oh, wow. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, this might be a little inside.  New Yorkers should get it.  Bill and Waterford.  This announcer is the white-walled Clyde Frazier.  Oh.  He's always coming up with some crazy ways to describe things.  All right.  Back to the chicks.  They aren't foam rubber.  Oh, no.  This should be good.  Groovy.  People will say,  Ah, she's phony.  That's all foam rubber.  I go, honey, believe what you want.  I don't care. 
[01:15:00]  No, that paltitude is real.  It's real.  Greta Dorwals.  I can't get enough of this, Mondo Topless.  Pat Barringer.  Sure.  We just aren't girls with names like this.  We wanted to show this at the O&A Traveling Virus, and we were told no at the last second.  We wanted this on the big screens as people were filing in. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, who wouldn't want to see this?  It's just topless girls.  Why can't you show that?  What's the problem with topless?  We can't show topless there?  I don't know.  It's the art of the topless.  We need a meeting.  We got to, like, readjust some things for the next O&A Traveling Virus.  We want Mondo Topless on the big screens.  Does the Live Nation own these places?  I don't know.  We'll get into it with Pete a little bit.  All right.  Back to the girls.  There were several times people that have been drinking a little too much would get up and stand next to the stage 
[01:16:00]  and start dancing and taking off their clothes and everything.  It's hilarious trying to get topless like I was.  The music puts me into a feeling of sex, and this is what I feel.  I don't feel anything around me.  I don't want to feel anything around me.  I want to feel only the music going through my body.  Whoa.  Men taking off their clothes so they can be topless like you? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, what?  I know, right?  Then I bit into the hot dog.  And it started screaming.  Back to the announcer.  May need to set up to avoid a dump.  This is the dance of the muff.  Right, right.  We talked about this before now.  This girl, what she is doing is holding a hand warmer.  They are known as a muff.  You see them at ski resorts.  Ski resorts.  They're made out of usually some kind of fur, maybe rabbit fur. 
[01:17:00]  They're rolled into a little roll.  And you stick your hands in each end of them to keep your hands warm.  Ladies do this.  The name of it is a muff.  And that's what she's referring to.  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  Here's the announcer.  The France has embraced the topless with wild enthusiasm.  Let us tarry for a moment in the provincial French city of Nancy, noted for its gates of gold, and drop in on dark-eyed Denise Duval, the voluptuous exhibitionist at Le Cabaret Sexy. 
[01:17:30]  Her tempting, teasing dance of the muff, spotlighting her breathtaking body, never failing to bring male blood pressure to a fever pit.  Yeah.  He is much better than the girls.  You get a little something out of the girls, but it's all about the announcer, man.  Yeah.  The guy is the best.  God, did he do anything else but this? 
[01:18:00]  We've got to find out.  We have to.  All right.  Back to the women here.  Calls her bathing suit a jockstrap.  In the walk, two seats are very brief, and I have several which I change.  It's mostly a bikini bottom, or what we call a jockstrap, which slips just the front and the back.  It's called jockstrap.  That's sexy.  Really?  Oh, let me put on my jockstrap.  Boy, they just didn't have the lingo down back then.  No.  Like, now they've got it figured out to make it sound all hot, you know? 
[01:18:30]  Way to take the sex out of the art of the topless.  Yeah.  A jockstrap is the art of the shortstop.  Stupid.  When I put in my cup, it covers my...  You're making a split screen over there, right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  You've got to get a picture of Norton for the new listeners, but we're getting the old photograph up of this girl that looks a lot like Jim Norton in a wig. 
[01:19:00]  There's the picture.  It's almost up.  All right.  The music makes me feel sex.  Not sexy.  It makes me feel sex.  Sex, right.  I have trouble getting dresses because if I buy a dress, I would have to buy it big enough to fit the top and then take the bottom in.  Like, say, a size 14 dress I'd have to buy and then take in the bottom to size 8.  Almost any type of music makes me feel sex. 
[01:19:30]  Also, color makes me feel sex.  Color makes me feel sex?  Yeah.  Wow.  She likes the black dudes.  I think it's all about the acid she was dropping to forget about what she's doing.  The art of the what?  Yeah.  It sounds all nice, but yeah.  You've got to think these girls were doing some kind of...  These days, it's, you know...  Kind of dope.  It's cocaine and champagne.  Hey, champagne.  Champagne cocktails.  High in the Sierra Mountains. 
[01:20:00]  Back then, it was all about just, you know, smoking the weed and a little acid to get their mind off the fact that maybe Daddy did something and now they're in the art of the topless.  Let's say hi to Josh in Dallas.  Josh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  At the beginning of the Muff Dancer skit, it sounds like Lil Jimmy playing the drums.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  Sorry, Jim.  No offense.  Yeah, we'll go to a break with Back in the New York Groove if we can, if we can find that. 
[01:20:30]  She said that any music makes her feel...  Sex.  Sex.  Sex.  I wonder if any fire songs would make her feel sex.  Where's the fire?  Where?  Where's the fire?  Do you know how many people are annoyed that that got stuck in their head?  Of course.  I'm so happy.  It's horrible.  Spoil everything for you.  We'll play that next after the break.  Back to the announcer.  He introduces Lorna.  Lorna.  Lovely.  Without artistic...  Is it going to be lovely, luscious, or life, lovacious, something? 
[01:21:00]  Lorna.  Lorna.  Lovely.  Luscious.  I didn't say luscious.  Oh, no.  Luscious Sin.  Oh.  You already said luscious.  He'll use this luscious again, though.  Let's see.  Lifesome.  Luscious.  Lifesome.  Lovely.  Lovely Lorna.  Nah, he's too good.  He's going to get something better than that. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  He can make lovely sound really good, though.  He just, like, favor pitch.  I got to go with luscious.  Luscious?  Yeah.  I know it's been used, but I can't think of anything else.  I'll go with lovely.  All right.  Luscious.  Lovely.  Without artistic surrender, without compromise, without question or apology, an important motion picture was produced.  Lorna.  A woman too much for one man.  Nothing?  It's Lorna too much for one man.  Without a bastard. 
[01:22:00]  A woman too much for one man.  It's star was an incredibly voluptuous young actress.  The embodiment of physical allure.  Her name?  Lorna Maitland.  She was chosen with the aid of the film you are now viewing from 132 applicants who responded to an advertisement in daily variety.  Advertisement.  After filming was completed and the film Lorna was released to the motion picture theaters, Miss Maitland had reason to be proud of the results and is now looking forward to a long and successful career as an actress. 
[01:22:30]  Let's listen to some candid post-production tape-recorded comments from Lorna Maitland.  Yeah, please, let's.  Wow, big setup.  She must be terrific.  Lorna Maitland.  She's got to be terrific.  Here she is, Lorna.  Yeah, I didn't actually notice anything at all from anyone.  In fact, I guess I wasn't thinking about it.  It wasn't on my mind.  I was working and as far as I thought, everyone else was thinking the same thing, you know. 
[01:23:00]  I found no reaction from anyone.  By the way, that's Than on the piano.  I remember the reaction on the ladies' faces.  I think they were staying there with their husbands and they were a bit shocked, I think, at first.  You think?  A bit shocked at first.  Brian from Boston.  Guys, why is it not okay to show boobs at the traveling virus, but Jim Norton's naked ass on a jumbotron is perfectly acceptable? 
[01:23:30]  That's a good point because one is sexy.  Jiggly Jimmy Norton.  His bodacious backside.  Veal like Norton.  The art of the homo.  Wait.  Oh, sorry.  Smooth amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts.  Shaved like a booksom baby.  As hairless as a toad. 
[01:24:00]  I think I enjoyed that scene quite a bit because  it gave me an opportunity to show another part of this Lorna character that we were trying to bring an image about.  And I enjoyed that because I like to bring variety into anything.  I think it's the spice of life and the spice of Lorna.  She's come up with that herself.  Variety is the spice of life.  Did you just say that, you dumb bim?  And then she said spice of Lorna. 
[01:24:30]  Spice of Lorna.  They all have that affected voice.  It's so odd.  Well, that doesn't disappoint.  There you go.  Mondo Topless, volume three.  God, I love it.  We'll get another one on maybe next week or so.  The ladies.  They're all lovely.  The announcer is so much better than the ladies.  I think they compliment each other.  You think?  Gotta say.  I like his setup and then their little chatting about nothing.  It just shows how stupid they are.  I like the Nordic nymph. 
[01:25:00]  What was her name again?  Greta.  Donna.  Greta.  What?  Dard.  Look how quickly we forget.  We're a bunch of dummies.  That's a tough name.  Which one was it?  Walt Thor.  Now I'm thinking Walt Thor.  Listen to him.  Tickle the ivories.  Luscious Nathaniel Bryant.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chester Rockwell. 
[01:25:30]  Smooth Lebanese arms.  Let me just play this.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big buxom bear.  Gourring at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying yes.  Yes. 
[01:26:00]  Chest shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom.  We're trying to get the listeners to produce some of this stuff for the Opie and Anthony show.  Have you gotten any yet, Steve?  You just got the one from Coke Logic, right?  All right.  I just want to play this again because I got to get her name.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience. 
[01:26:30]  Greta Thorwald, the Nordic nymph.  Thorwald.  Pulchritude is unrivaled by any showgirl in Denmark.  Her youthful bosom, flat stomach, firm hips, and smooth, lithe legs all seem to unite in  her wildly exotic dance, which she delivers in a burst of uninhibited frenzy.  Greta Thorwald.  Just remember, door and a wall.  And just throw a D at the end of it.  Thorwald D.  Thorwald.  You made Greta Thorwald sound sexy. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Greta Thorwald.  Greta, you know where Greta Dorwald must be right now?  Looking like a Greta Dorwald in an old folks home.  Greta Drywall.  Just sitting.  Trying to get someone to listen to her now.  I used to be a star in the art of the topless.  The what?  Back when we did it, it was an art form.  Not like now. 
[01:27:30]  They used to call me bodacious.  Now they call me saggy.  Pantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini Steve.  Hope earrings.  Greta Dorwald is dead.  Oh, is she?  There's your reality check.  I don't know.  She's got to be.  She's got to be.  Really?  Think about it.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:28:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3.  K-Rock.  You're about to listen to another funny bit during the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Here it is.  That should keep them listening longer, huh?  Yes.  Yet another hysterical segment from the Opie and Anthony Show archives since, you know, we're not here.  We'll see you after the holidays.  I hope it was good.  All right.  We got a quickie here.  Skateboarder breaks arm, screams, cries like a little girl. 
[01:28:30]  These are always fun to listen to.  And then we may have a nice little surprise.  Oh.  If you want to do this today.  But first, this.  Here's the skateboard.  Don't get to somebody.  Please.  Dude.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:29:00]  Dude.  Calm down.  Are you sure?  Yes.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I know.  I know.  It's going to kill me.  Dude, this is still going in our tape, man.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  How did Bob Kelly get in there?  Those are the real sounds from the tree fort that night. 
[01:29:30]  Ah.  I wish I knew I'd have quit you.  Ah.  Well, that's a good one right there.  Wow.  Very good.  He did kind of bitch it up there, didn't he?  I love his pals, though.  Oh, this is so going in our tape.  So going in our tape, dude.  All right.  Do you want to do Mondo Topless Volume 4?  Wow.  Wow.  The final volume, I believe.  Ironic, by the way, because I got my copy of Mondo Topless yesterday. 
[01:30:00]  Mondo Topless.  One o'clock in the morning, I had to throw it in for a few minutes.  Yeah.  I watched like 15 minutes of it.  Those girls, they are really sexy, man.  All natural.  Oh, my God.  The one who's driving the car in the beginning?  Yeah.  God, they're like two missile silos.  It takes place in San Francisco, and she's driving up and down those hills in this old car, obviously, because it's back in the, I guess, early 60s.  And she's just moving from side to side, so her boobs get a little more action. 
[01:30:30]  They did the worst dances to showcase their bosoms.  Oh, yeah.  Every time they dance, they look like Hepburn in UnGolden Pond.  You know, ah, do the loons.  That's where you stand there when your husband gets lost looking for blueberries.  Did you see Mud Girl?  Ah, yeah, yeah.  They're sexy, man.  Just rolling around in the mud with her huge boobs.  That's the girl on the beach.  She was psychotic, though.  The girl on the beach doing the wacky dance, and they kept cutting back to just this reel-to-reel tape recorder playing the song. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  What the hell are they thinking?  What are you plugging in on the beach?  What the hell are you at the beach?  Well, it was sort of porn for the day.  That was before porn, right?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Guys in the theaters.  As far as mainstream porn goes, because porn was always there.  Yeah.  Guys in the theaters must have been going nuts watching that.  Yeah, because all it was was girls talking about their boobs with rock and roll music.  They called it The Topless.  The Art of The Topless.  The Art of The Topless.  It's an old Russ Meyer film. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, and the guy, the narrator, has a very fun voice.  He kind of gets into the whole thing, narrating it.  Yeah.  He gets very excited.  Very energetic.  He's the guy that says, but enough of this palaver.  Yeah.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's how we still all start, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  So if you've heard that, you've heard that guy's voice.  All right.  So you're ready for Mondo Topless, Volume 4?  I couldn't be more ready.  I think we played Mondo Topless when we were on vacation.  I think that made the replay. 
[01:32:00]  But here's Volume 4.  Brand new material for everybody.  And the last volume.  So we'll start with this clip.  I was wearing beads, as I recall, around the neck and a black patent belt at the waist  with a rather scanty bottom G-string.  And I was doing some sort of wild Watusi or something.  The wild Watusi.  Just really unsexy dialogue and the greatest stripper names ever.  Pat Barrington.  Or is it Baringer? 
[01:32:30]  Pat Baringer.  Pat Baringer.  Pat Baringer.  Pat Baringer.  And the buxom Pat Baringer.  He always has some word to describe the girl.  My favorite was the Nordic Nymph.  Ah, Nordic Nymph.  The Nordic Nymph.  50-50 word counts.  Speak to me, bad bet.  Bad bet.  Bad bet.  Baby.  Baby.  Well, here's the announcer.  Paris, seductive female that she is, has played mistress to the world for centuries. 
[01:33:00]  Saints and sinners from all corners of the earth have been lured to her bosom by her siren song,  eager to indulge in her many sensual pleasures.  Let's high away to Blas Pigat, the wild and lustful monument to sexual eroticism,  and drop into Los Finks, and thrill to the wantonest of Gigi Latouche,  the girl with the throbbing guitar.  Throbbing guitar?  Gigi Latouche. 
[01:33:30]  I like when he drops a little French accent in there.  Yeah.  Color it up.  Just has a way with words.  Wonderful.  He knows how to use his words.  With the ever-increasing popularity of skin diving,  it is only reasonable to conclude that the topless would become a very important adjunct to the sport.  With very little training, the novice can learn to use her breathing apparatus below the surface of the water quite readily.  And many relaxing and satisfying moments can be achieved, 
[01:34:00]  particularly when amateur motion pictures are employed to record the pleasureful event.  Skin diving.  That was just an excuse to get the girls in water.  Underwater.  Yeah, of course.  Are they doing some snuba?  Snuba.  The topless.  Just getting, uh, just coming up with excuses to get the girls topless in all these situations.  In bouncy cars, underwater, in mud, running through the forest, the dance of the muff. 
[01:34:30]  Do they show any bottom of it or just top?  Uh, no, it's the art of the topless.  Yeah.  They don't want to mess it up with the art of the bottomless.  When I'm doing the topless, it's different than my exotic.  That's the girl from the beach, right, with the little pigtails?  Yeah.  It's different.  I could be wild and free with my, when I'm doing the topless.  The topless.  There's a whole thing.  Who knew? 
[01:35:00]  All right, back to, uh, one of the girls.  Here's a European girl.  Ooh.  Talking about her art of the topless.  Good.  In Europe, men and men and women are together.  Men and men?  And they feel like make love.  They aren't going to make love.  And in America, well, they go in a roundabout way asking, well, you want to see my stamp collection?  If he wants to see a stamp collection, fine.  But if he wants to make love, well, they should tell him.  There shouldn't be no shame in wanting to make love.  Like, there's no shame in wanting to eat steak or drink water or milk or liquor or whatever. 
[01:35:30]  On the other hand, I do not like a rude approach.  A man can always be very romantic.  And a man can, um, always seduce a woman if he knows how.  Because most of the time, a woman gets seduced much more mentally at first.  But if that's what he wants, he should seduce and not talk about his stamp collection.  What is this stupid **** talking about?  What?  She doesn't want to hear about your stamp collection. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Something about stones, though.  That's what I heard.  She's talking about rocks?  Yeah, because...  In her head.  The stones weren't that popular.  No, okay.  They were just coming onto the scene.  She was talking about the Rolling Stones?  No, I don't know.  I thought she was talking about, like, rocks or something.  Yeah, she's...  I couldn't understand a word she was saying.  She might as well talk out her ****.  All right, back to the announcer here.  Berlin today is a city divided.  With the eastern sector under the cruel domination of communism and West Berlin part of the free world. 
[01:36:30]  Located only a stone's throw from the fashionable Kurfürstendamm, the Broadway of Berlin,  we encounter the Fair Lady Film Bar, where a Bunda Vita, the bosom bountiful, is about to begin her act of...  The bosom bountiful.  Is that what he said?  I think so.  I think I gotta go back.  The bosom bountiful?  Ah, tongue, baby!  The film bar, where a Bunda Vita, the bosom bountiful, is about to begin her act of primitive passion. 
[01:37:00]  In the capacity crowds flock to see a Bunda Vita fantastically developed exercise her magnificent pectoral pulchritude  as she wantonly entertains the sporting crowds of Berlin with fierce intensity.  I love it.  How can that not be your favorite film ever?  Like two V-2 rockets on her chest.  We wanted to play this movie during the ONA traveling virus as people were coming in, but we can't do it for some reason. 
[01:37:30]  It's so harmless, man.  It really is.  It's not porno.  It's not like guys and girls together having sex or anything.  It's just chicks dancing ridiculously.  With their bottoms on and their tops off.  That's all it is.  Can't have that kind of nudity in a state-run building where the union takes 30% of marriage.  How about this?  How about we do a Mondo Topless showing in the parking lot at the Tweeter Center before the ONA traveling virus?  That'd be good. 
[01:38:00]  Where could we do it, though?  Well, you've just got to get a hold of the pest.  We'll give them a copy of the tape, and then they do it upright.  Will the troopers patrolling the parking lot have a problem, though?  Showing smut.  Is it smut, though?  No.  It's like from 1960.  I know.  How do you even look at that?  I don't even know the year of the film.  Well, no, but the thing is, in a state-run building like that, you can't show toplessness  because you're too busy serving alcohol, which will cause a lot of your patrons to drive home 
[01:38:30]  and kill a family of six.  Yeah, there you go.  So don't show breasts because they might be too busy drinking.  Yeah, perish the thought.  They think about bosoms on the way home.  On the way home.  Keep drinking.  We've got to show this Mondo Topless tape because it's hard to get.  You must see it.  I went into Tower Records recently.  That's where I got my copy.  Yeah.  Can't find it.  And at the time, it was the only, you know, it was the only Russ Meyer film available. 
[01:39:00]  Who's getting money from that?  Like, you bought it.  Who got the, like, buck royalty from it?  Someone bought the rights probably in the 70s and was just eating it.  Yeah.  Like a check comes through and goes, who the hell bought Mondo Topless?  Why are all these people buying it now?  Yeah, all of a sudden, what the hell?  In these 22 markets.  A resurgence.  Chris from Illinois.  This tired Mondo Topless BS wasn't funny the first three times.  Enough already.  The narrator has a unique voice and the sluts are dumb.  We get it.  Move on.  Okay, so how about this? 
[01:39:30]  We're going to finish the bit.  Why don't you turn something else on in Illinois?  Yeah, Chris, why don't you go check out Eric and Kathy?  Yeah.  Just leave, idiot.  I'm sure they're doing riveting radio today.  Yeah.  So if you don't like it, turn on our competitor, whoever that is, and don't come back.  What do you think of that?  Because we love this stuff.  Right.  Here's another girl.  Show is for us.  That's right.  Not you.  That's right.  You don't get it.  Are we almost done?  I don't want him to.  I don't want him to.  Don't leave.  Don't leave.  Come back.  Come back. 
[01:40:00]  I was kidding.  Guys that don't know how to dance, and they should, whenever they come over to the apartment,  I'm always trying to teach them new steps on how to dance, and they're very inhibited.  They always feel a little self-conscious, and they want to have a few drinks first.  Who wants to dance in your stupid apartment?  No kidding.  I'm a gambling idiot.  They're trying to bang this girl, and she's like, you got to take your two arms and throw  them back towards you.  Shut up.  I did the whole dance thing. 
[01:40:30]  It was just to get in the apartment.  I didn't really want to learn to dance.  Trying to bang this broad, Hendry.  Joe, I'm prejudiced against the poker.  All right.  Back to the announcer.  Talking about Heidi Richter.  Hamburg is the second largest city in West Germany, and continental Europe's most vital  harbor.  Let's journey uptown to the Casino de Paris, the perfect place to cast Anchorage for pleasure,  and peek in on Heidi Richter, a tall, blonde, Aryan beauty of perfect proportion. 
[01:41:00]  And watch her as she squirms and rides topless on a luxurious bed, contorting her supple body  in a manner which defies description.  Come on now.  How can you not enjoy this?  You're a jackass if you don't love what that guy just said.  How do you not love him?  I can listen to this guy all day.  Defies description.  He doesn't even try. 
[01:41:30]  Contorting her...  What did he call it?  A fancy bed?  Some kind of bed.  A what, buddy?  Luxurious bed.  Bed.  She dialed 1-800-MATRESS.  See, you get all the plugs and it works that way.  I like that.  Watch her photograph herself and look at it on her power book.  She had two giant tweeters, not unlike the tickets going on sale for lawn seats at the 
[01:42:00]  tweeter center at 9 a.m.  Steve's a...  Double D MCO.  Don't forget about stacker two.  XPLC.  Oh, stacker two.  Two large stacks.  As she writhes around, contorting her body.  Leaving slug trails all over her 1-800-MATRESS. 
[01:42:30]  But that's okay if she needs another two-hour delivery.  I don't even take the old mattress for you.  Leave off the last S for a slug trail.  We have a girl here talking about her first photo shoot. 
[01:43:00]  He just wanted to take some pictures of me at first.  And then all of a sudden he asked me, would you like to be a playmate?  Or try for Playboy magazine.  And so I thought of her, so no, never, you know.  But then I don't know what changed my mind.  But I just tried for it and I didn't make it.  The reason being that this is what they said.  That my bus line was too big.  No, he probably didn't want to sleep with half. 
[01:43:30]  Who wouldn't want to buy this buxom broad a Fidelity Diamond?  Her boobs were too big for Playboy.  Was that it?  That changed over the years, huh?  These girls were sexy, man.  I watched some of this footage and these girls were just natural.  Their breasts were, they were just amazing.  Yeah, very natural girls.  Heavy.  Yeah.  Teardrops.  Yeah.  Shutting out in a seductive.  Oh, wow. 
[01:44:00]  You're good.  I can't help it.  Mondo Topless 2.  Yes.  You can narrate.  Giant teardrops.  All right, we're almost done.  Here's another European.  Watch Mondo Topless on a Panasonic plasma television.  The TV is flat, but these broads aren't.  Your flat screen goes three-dimensional when these dummies walk you to the frame. 
[01:44:30]  These double-D dummies.  All right.  European girl talking about how some men just fall asleep while she's doing the art of the topless.  What?  I don't buy it open.  How could that happen?  There are men who do not respond.  Some of them either talk or look there to fall asleep.  So I believe either they don't like girls or I don't know what's in their mind.  They do know this is burlesque.  So naturally, I try to ignore it.  Although, you know, I find this pretty frustrating. 
[01:45:00]  This happens so seldom, but naturally, it does bother me when it happens.  I see men falling asleep while they're talking too much.  Exactly.  They watch you do the topless, and then when your mouth opens, they doze off.  You idiotic European melatonin.  And they come over to my apartment, and I try to teach them to dance.  Do ya?  Here's the dance I want to do.  The shut up and blah, blah, blah.  You take two steps, Neil. 
[01:45:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's how that dance goes.  Mondo dignity-less.  Mondo tea-sellers.  All right, we're almost done.  Here's the announcer.  Place Begale has no corner on the thrill market of Paris.  Just as naughty and nice is the Etoile area,  which boasts such famous night spots as the Lido, Le Sexy,  and the piece de resistance of niteries,  spotlighting the topless.  The world-famous Crazy Horse Saloon. 
[01:46:00]  Witnessing the passionate performance of vivacious Yvette Legrand  is a never-to-be-forgotten delight.  So let's look in on this buxom brunette,  the most curvaceous cowgirl in the Western world,  as she tempestuously tosses her torso  in the most sizzling, topless spectacle  ever brought to the Crazy Horse Saloon.  Wow.  I want to go.  How do you not want to go?  What a build-up.  Tempestuous.  And she's just some whore up there. 
[01:46:30]  Of course she is.  Like, what happened?  This guy made it sound so good.  Doing an awful dance.  Just some horrible dance.  With the arms going straight out, back and forth, back and forth,  and then just the breast shaking.  And that's the topless.  The art of the topless.  The art.  Some bad old Watusi dance or the swim.  Look.  See, people either love this bit or hate this bit.  We got Rich from Queens.  Every time we play this, I'm late for work.  This is the funniest thing ever.  I can't stop listening. 
[01:47:00]  Some queer from Illinois doesn't like it.  Who cares?  Love it or hate it.  I can't stop there already.  You're gonna get it.  That's right.  You'll have a dumb Midwestern accent, so drunk drive into a wall.  Stupid.  It's our show, and we'll do whatever we want on it.  We don't care about ratings.  We're self-indulgent idiots.  All right, one more from the European Union.  Listen as they plaster a smile on their face and plow through this one more time. 
[01:47:30]  That's right.  Eric and Kathy, that tempestuous dummy and his stupid whore of a sidekick.  Witless banter with music.  All right, here we go.  Listen to this deaf, idiotic reporter babble through another special interest retard baby story. 
[01:48:00]  Illinois, leave off the last S.  It's silent, you retard.  Another European girl.  Mondo Topless.  I have perfectly good control of my boss.  I can move them, and I can do also tassel walk, but with this, I don't believe it's very sexy, so I don't do it.  I try to do movement like a man and a woman are in a bedroom, and the woman is being seduced, and I try to do very soft and also sensuous movement. 
[01:48:30]  I have no idea what she's saying.  Yeah, these girls are...  Something about bosom control.  Ah, is that it?  Something about bosom control.  She can move them?  Yeah, something about...  Independently of herself.  All right, finally, the last clip.  The announcer signs off.  Oh, no!  Mondo Topless.  The end is done.  Well, Mondo Topless measures up.  The unmistakable Russ Meyer touch makes this more than a gang of great gals. 
[01:49:00]  It makes it move.  We sincerely hope that you enjoyed the flick.  Hey, I love the, uh...  Nice.  First of all, what year was that?  Do we know, Than?  And also, what's that guy's name?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, we don't know.  There's no way to Google it?  No, we tried.  We're trying to get him.  Yeah, he's old.  He's older than...  He's gotta be, like, 90. 
[01:49:30]  He's older than dirt, man.  Just because he's alive doesn't mean he could talk.  I'd love to get him on this show.  Part of the Topless.  Yeah.  Part of the Topless.  John what?  John Furlong.  John Furlong.  John Furlong.  Is he living?  Look him up on IMDb.  Yeah, he's supposed to still be alive.  He's dead?  What?  You're kidding!  We've been looking for him, and Roland's gotten one response that said he's still alive,  another that said he has...  That he has...  Did he die in 2001 of pneumonia? 
[01:50:00]  Sure, Jimmy.  Dead and alive.  50-50 where it counts.  That's right.  In the casket.  Hey, uh...  Look him up on IMDb.  It says he's still alive there.  Go back, Iraq.  Yeah.  They had the...  Go up.  Uh...  Babette Bardot.  Oh, the girls.  She's gotta be dead right now.  Her real name is Bouncy?  Bouncy Babette. 
[01:50:30]  All right, whatever.  They have their real names and their stage names, and you can't tell which is the real name  and which one is the stage name.  All right, we're gonna take it.  That's exactly what the scene would look like if that idiot columnist there...  What was his name?  Bill Gallo.  Yeah.  If he got in the ring with this beast, it would look just like Clubber Lang bitch-slapping Mickey. 
[01:51:00]  Ah, rock.  Ah.  I'll...  I'll get him, rock.  Here he is.  Come on, get in the ring.  Oh, ow, ow, ow.  Hey, ow, ow, hey.  Oh, no, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  And Rocky wants to help him the whole time, but...  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  But Mickey's like, no, I can handle this one, rock.  I can handle it.  You just sit there and watch what I do to this, punk.  I'll get this, punk.  We'll fight fair and square.  Come on, punk.  Put up your dukes.  Hey, Vicky.  He brought a shovel into the ring, Rock.  He's caving my skull in, Rock. 
[01:52:00]  Don't worry, I can handle this one.  My head looks like oatmeal.  I don't think that's allowed in the ring, sir.  Apparently it is.  I just like the visual of him taking him on,  and Rocky's not allowed to do anything  because Vicky just thinks he can handle this punk.  Come on, Vicky.  He's picking me up.  Oh, no, he's trying to work.  Oh, God, Rock. 
[01:52:30]  Rocky's just waiting for the call.  Come on, let me get in there.  Hey, let me in, Vicky.  Maybe I can help you out with the guy.  No, I'll handle him, Rock.  I'll handle him.  My wool cap is full of stew, but I could... 
[01:53:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Whoa!  Oh!  Stupid Anthony's doing old-school radio.  What, do you want to, like, do the horse toys, too?  I need coconuts.  He's running me over with a horse, Rock.  Rocky, he's running me over with a horse. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, no, Rock.  He's picked up a dolphin.  He's hitting me with a dolphin.  Ow!  Not a sheep!  We're not even close to the water.  How's he doing this?  Mickey, any time, you know, you want a little help, just kind of chime in, or maybe I'll punch 
[01:54:00]  the guy or something.  I've been training for this fight.  Looks like you could use a little help.  I hate a tiger, Mickey.  I hate a tiger.  All right, Rocket.  Why am I at the end of a bowling alley?  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, he's bowling intent to me.  Ow!  What do you mean, is it safe?  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  He's drilling my teeth, Rock!  Rock, he's drilling my teeth! 
[01:54:30]  Ow!  Oh.  Now he's offering me some oil of clove, Rock.  Just say the word.  No!  I'll handle him, Rock.  Just raise your hand or something.  No, not there!  The dolphin again!  I just love the signal.  Just raise your hand and I'll help you, Mickey. 
[01:55:00]  Ow!  Oh, no, not there!  He hit me with a horse, Rock.  Oh, no.  What's he pulling out of his pocket, Rock?  I'll get him if you want.  No, I got him!  He tased me, Rock. 
[01:55:30]  Just say the word, Mick.  I got your back.  I got him, Rock.  You want a piece of me?  You want a piece of me?  That's exactly what it would look like.  With all these people that are brave enough to take this punk on.  80-year-old columnist is going to beat up this guy.  Oh, man.  Is that...  Very funny.  Why would he hit him with a dolphin?  Like, people would just accept that and watch it.  Like, here's the thing. 
[01:56:00]  The dolphin would have to be sitting somewhere for him to grab it.  Like, no one would question why there was a dolphin by the side of the ring.  But he's just pummeling the old guy with it.  Yeah.  He picks up this endangered animal and hits an elderly man with his gloves on.  How do you do that with your gloves on?  I don't even know how you'd hold them.  They're slippery.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[01:56:30]  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Can we move on to our next guest?  Oh, brother.  Is this another installment of Has Been Corner?  It might turn out to be.  Yeah.  What is this guy pushing?  Remember LeBeau?  The French guy that always made the strudel for Schultz?  So he would let him do things? 
[01:57:00]  A gay guy.  Is he gay?  French gay.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no.  The French guy from Hogan's Heroes.  What's his real name?  Um, God.  Robert Clay?  Clay?  I don't know.  Well, uh...  Robert.  Well, plunk him down so we can...  So we could, uh, say hi to him.  Robert.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Who are you?  Are you Opie or Anthony? 
[01:57:30]  Uh, we're both on the phone right now as we speak.  I know, but the one who's talking right now, who is that?  Oh, that's Anthony.  That's Anthony.  Yes.  Lovely name.  How are you?  I'm fine, Anthony.  You know, I, uh, remember, uh...  I look back, uh, with such fondness on Hogan's Heroes.  Wow.  And, uh...  I'm trying to remember which one he was.  Oh, that's Opie.  That's Opie.  Yeah, I'm trying to remember which one you were.  Well, why don't you just look at the book or just watch it tonight, then you know who  I am.  Opie?  Were you, uh, the gay guy on Hogan's Heroes?  Oh, Opie, don't give me that dumb thing. 
[01:58:00]  Opie, stop it.  Just stop it with gay guy.  There were no gay guys.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Is that your train you gotta do?  That's what Opie's like.  I'm sorry, Robert.  Well, he didn't tell him to shut up.  You know, shut up, Opie.  You know something?  I don't think he was as big a fan of Hogan's Heroes.  It doesn't matter, but he doesn't have to say those dumb things.  No, the guy one, the guy with the...  Shut up, Opie.  Let's Anthony talk.  The guy with the, uh, the little...  The beret.  The beret.  The cute little gay hat.  No, it was...  Opie, stop it.  What's your problem, Opie?  No, I'm just asking if that was you.  What is your problem, Opie? 
[01:58:30]  Tell me.  Was that you?  No, just tell me first.  What is your problem about gay people?  Really, Opie?  Oh, you're really gay?  That was just...  No, you're really gay because you keep on mentioning it.  Right.  Opie.  I just said you were the gay guy at Hogan's Heroes.  Let Anthony talk to me.  Robert, I apologize for Opie.  I didn't know you were really gay.  I just thought you were the gay looking guy.  Gay is something that was very happy years ago when I was a young kid.  And if you want that kind of interpretation, yes, I'm very happy.  So you're a very happy gay fella. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, shut up, Opie.  Opie enough.  Leave Robert alone.  And he's laughing.  He's laughing at his dumb jokes.  See, he's laughing.  The dumb jokes I've ever heard.  Thank you, Robert.  Nobody cares about gay or not gay these days.  Right.  Just shut up, Opie.  Robert, are you going to bring in a gingerbread house for us?  Was that Opie again?  Yes.  I'm not going to answer it.  Good.  I'm just going to talk to you, Anthony.  If you make sense, I will answer you.  If you don't make sense, just too bad. 
[01:59:30]  No, I understand that.  I apologize for Opie again.  Like I said, I was the big fan of Hogan's Heroes.  Got herself superior to little...  Opie.  Enough.  You know what's going to happen.  If he continues like this, I'm just going to hang up.  See?  It's not worthwhile.  No, Robert...  That's not why I'm doing this interview.  Of course.  I have written a book that is very dear to me.  See?  And he's going to make fun of all this shit, these things.  Who cares?  Then I'd better hang up.  Now you've got Robert cursing. 
[02:00:00]  Exactly.  Yeah, Robert, don't curse.  I appreciate the work you've done.  And like I said, you've brought joy to so many people over the years.  I loved...  Oh, you like that, don't you?  Hello.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Would you stop it?  Opie is being a jackass, if I may.  Well, he is a jackass.  If he's not being one, he is a jackass.  Yes.  There's no doubt about it.  I don't even know what he looks physically, but he is a jackass.  Because nobody will keep on doing those things that he's saying.  I know. 
[02:00:30]  I apologize.  I'm much more polite than you are, Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to be quiet and let somebody with intelligence talk to me.  Robert, I...  Thank you.  I made a grave error, and I apologize to you.  I was a big fan of Hogan's Heroes.  It was a great show.  It was odd.  I just want to know a little something about how you were cast in that show.  Now, and your opinion of it being not many people know...  You're a kid toucher!  Opie.  Not many people know that you're Jewish.  Yeah, well, I never hid that I was Jewish. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  When I first arrived in America, I never hid that because I'm very proud to be Jewish.  Right.  The Well got cast in a show.  I was in Los Angeles, and my agent went to see the producer, the producer at film, and  he was asking who else he needed for the pilot.  And the producer said, see, I need a Frenchman.  And my agent said, Robert Clary is in town because I was living in New York at that time.  Don't just stare at it.  I think that's exactly who I want, and I didn't read.  The next day, I went to see it at film, and he said, the part is yours. 
[02:01:30]  Ah, there you go.  How did you feel, though, about being in a sitcom that, you know, had Nazis and swastikas on  the set?  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's an old actor.  And the actors, most actors work very little.  They have very few highs, very lots of lows.  Right.  And you accept jobs because you're an actor, you're going to accept.  Secondly, even though I was in concentration camps, and I was for three years practically  dying through the Nazi-ism.  You were in a concentration camp. 
[02:02:00]  Now, you were captured by the Nazis.  I was arrested by the French policemen, sent to camps in Paris, and then sent to Germany  to, yes, by the Nazis.  And my parents were...  Opie.  Opie.  And you were sent to, uh...  You know something?  I'm going to hang up.  I really cannot stand that kind of thing.  It is not my cup of tea. 
[02:02:30]  I don't like those kind of jokes.  I think it's...  If he makes fun because I was in concentration camp, he makes some laughing tracks, then up  his...  Robert, I understand.  I...  This happens...  I don't need that to plug my book.  I've worked my...  I've worked a lot of years to write something that I believe in, and truthfully, and if I'm  going to...  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I don't need him.  Exactly.  I don't need him.  That kind of thing I will resent.  I apologize because, for some reason, this happens every time we get a guest on the phone. 
[02:03:00]  He's got to be a jackass.  Well, I think he's got to be a dick.  I try to...  Let me ask you a question.  Do the public who listened to your show likes what he does?  No.  I mean, who does he cater to?  The five-year-old kid?  Go and ask yourself!  Pretty much, Robert.  It's...  Well, then let me find a kid show a person, and let me be happy with that.  He's got what they call a sophomoric sense of humor that I don't appreciate personally.  It doesn't work for me.  I have much more class than that, and I can offend people like him. 
[02:03:30]  I am not only interested in Hogan's Hero Stories, but the From the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes book, the autobiography of Robert Clary that...  Man, you are one thing better.  I'm telling you, I'm going to hang up.  You're going to feel sorry.  I really need one more laugh out of you.  See?  I'm hanging up because I really don't care.  Exactly.  And, well, you shouldn't.  Opie, just shut up.  You've been...  I know they're very, very mean right now.  You've been through quite a bit.  And you've made quite a name for yourself. 
[02:04:00]  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to self-mean you.  Yes, Robert.  Yes, Robert.  I'm sorry.  It was very nice talking to you, but I really don't want to...  Very nice talking, guys.  Robert.  Robert.  Robert.  Hello?  God, is that awful?  There it is.  I'm sorry.  It was an interview with Robert Clay. 
[02:04:30]  He liked me.  Good DJ, bad DJ.  Why don't you call the publicist and see how long...  Stop!  Don't even!  God!  And I will give you $100 on the spot if you get him back on the phone.  And you don't, because I can't take this anymore.  Dude, when you played the can laugh, and he just stopped in his tracks.  Worse than playing can laughs after someone says their mother died of a bleeding stomach. 
[02:05:00]  Well, I think we should...  The guy's telling about how he was captured by the Nazis.  Well, I think we all should go to his restaurant in Brooklyn and make it up to him.  He's got a restaurant?  Oh, that's the other Frenchie.  He's not with you, idiot.  Holy Jesus Christ.  Robert?  Yes?  I was talking with Opie during the time since you hung up and now, and I'm sorry, and I believe he owes you an apology. 
[02:05:30]  He owes me to close his mouth and not open it.  Right.  That's what it is.  And if he does this, I will continue.  Otherwise, forget it.  I will hang up again.  I completely understand, right?  I am not a slave.  I am not a moron.  I'm not a kid.  Exactly.  And he can have his jokes with somebody else, not with me.  You know, somebody who's been through as much as you doesn't...  He shouldn't have to put up with juvenile...  Even if he doesn't do anything.  ...juvenile shenanigans. 
[02:06:00]  It's the easiest joke in the world to call everybody a f***ing one, is that?  Exactly.  It's terrible for the homosexuals to do what he does.  He's an idiot.  Yeah.  I understand.  And I hope that's on the air.  Now, well, let's...  You know something?  Let's smooth this over and get back to talking about you, your book, your career.  Because I'd rather talk about that than dwell on what an idiot Opie is being.  I hope so. 
[02:06:30]  I hope you...  I hope he's not going to say anything.  I'm telling you, I will hang up again.  I understand.  What other things can we look for on the book?  Because not many people know you have a very interesting life.  The book is my life story.  My youth in France.  In France.  My huge family.  I'm the 14th of the last children of my parents.  Very poor family with a great childhood anyway.  You had a great childhood.  Now, wasn't this at the time that the war was going on?  Well, I was born in 1926, and a war started in Europe in 1939. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Which means I was 13 years old when a war started in France.  Yeah.  When the German occupied France in 1940, then in 1941, we Jews had laws.  We had rules.  Right.  We had to wear a yellow star of David.  We had curfews.  We could not do anything.  And suddenly, eventually, we got all arrested and sent to concentration camps.  And mostly, to gas chambers.  Oh, my God.  So...  And I have like 12 or 13 of my immediate family was deported.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  And I'm the only one who came back.  I was lucky to survive the three years of spending concentration.  Now, how did you get the...  How did you escape?  Well, I was young.  I was 16 years old when I was arrested.  Good-bye.  Open.  Oh.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  All right.  Look.  Turn that off!  Wait a second. 
[02:08:00]  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Holy...  Holy...  Holy...  Holy...  Well, he was stupid enough to call back.  How bad does he need to promote his book?  Hold on.  I can't for you.  Hold on.  He was the lead singer of, uh...  Of, uh...  Ramstein.  This...  Before, uh...  Holy...  Holy...  Holy...  Holy...  I...  I am more...  I cannot believe... 
[02:08:30]  You played...  You played...  You know, I was expecting something.  I...  We don't even know.  I never expected that.  I don't know what that was.  Holy...  And let's keep it that way.  He thinks he knows.  Uh...  Look at this instant feedback we're getting.  I'm amazed it took this long for a Frenchman to give up.  He surrendered his phone call.  Jesus Christ.  That was probably... 
[02:09:00]  Let me just say this.  I said this a lot.  I am going to say it for the record.  That is probably the worst thing you've ever done.  That right there.  Worse than anything.  The dead friend with the old lady.  Telling the kid there's no Santa.  Nothing has been worse than what you just did.  I am stupefied.  What about the Shirley, though?  Don't even try to come up with something.  Cindy Williams.  It's not even close.  There's not even a close second.  What a...  No. 
[02:09:30]  He doesn't have a sense of humor.  He was in Hogan's Heroes.  All right.  You know something?  I'll buy that.  I'll buy that argument.  The guy did.  He went through what he went through.  But then he went on a situation comedy about a Nazi prisoner camp.  But that's the worst thing you've ever done on this show.  You know worse than Dr. Smith?  Nothing.  Compared to what you just did.  Matt from Long Island.  The most uncomfortable radio I have ever heard.  Never heard.  Jim, what's up?  Oh, man.  I got to go to church just listening to that. 
[02:10:00]  Holy Christ.  You're out of your mind.  Oh, Jesus.  I feel like...  Well, I don't care if I'm in hell because you guys will be there.  But Jesus.  Woo!  I'm reading instant feedback from people that are horrified.  Hitler's speech went beyond anything you've ever done.  Oh, my God.  And that's Tuttle.  That guy's a scumbag.  Wow.  He insulted me.  He insulted you? 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  Right?  Fine.  However you sleep at night. </pre>
