<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, likely from late 2013, centered around a chaotic Christmas party atmosphere in the studio.  The show opened with a discussion surrounding the Phil Robertson controversy from *Duck Dynasty*, debating free speech versus corporate responsibility, with varied opinions expressed by the hosts and a caller highlighting perceived media hypocrisy.  This segment featured numerous musical interludes, often chosen ironically, and recurring jokes about a nonexistent dance floor and Dunkin' Donuts.  Guests present throughout much of the broadcast included DJ Dennis Falcone, Bobo (a frequent caller and Jeff Gordon fan), Lady Di (who recounted a drunken fall injuring her knee), comedian Colin Quinn, and Sean F. (who performed a Christmas song). A call to Jeff Gordon arranged for Bobo was underwhelming.  The segment concluded with a humorous, profane reading of “’Twas the Night Before Christmas.”

The Christmas party atmosphere intensified, with Lady Di, heavily intoxicated and smelling strongly of cigarettes, dressed for a supposed meeting with Paul McCartney.  The conversation frequently digressed into tangents about car accidents (recounted by Lady Di and co-host Marion), and interactions with Sandy Kane, a woman who had previously sued the show multiple times.  Sandy Kane was eventually called and agreed to come to the studio.  A heated, profane argument erupted between Marion and caller Bob Levy.  Other guests present included Colin Quinn and Lee Dye.  The highly offensive and vulgar language continued throughout this segment.

The party continued with numerous guests including Bobo, Lady Di, Colin Quinn, Jim Norton, Stalker Patty, and Sandy Kane.  The conversation was highly informal and included frequent interruptions and vulgar and sexually explicit topics. Recurring themes included Bobo's penis size, Lady Di's potential for a tit lift and job search, Stalker Patty’s job hunt, virginity, and a genital wart ("Twato"), Sandy Kane's past lawsuits and work as a naked cowgirl, and numerous off-color jokes and anecdotes.  Attempts were made to show Sandy's "Twato" to other guests.  Multiple guests shared personal stories, often interrupting each other.  Musical interludes and mentions of Paul McCartney, Jake LaMotta, and Rodger punctuated the segment.  A phone call with Marion was attempted but interrupted by the studio's chaos.

A chaotic and highly sexually charged conversation ensued, focusing on callers Marion and Lady Di.  Their conversation included crude sexual innuendo, discussions of drinking, and a heated exchange about a past incident involving Marion's workplace and African-American coworkers.  The discussion veered into Lady Di’s employment history, her relationship with Patty, and descriptions of physical injuries.  The hosts and other callers frequently used racial slurs and engaged in sexually explicit banter.  A caller, "Who Dat," briefly joined, along with Bobo and Mike Pichetti. A humorous, offensive re-enactment of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" was performed.  A prank call supposedly from Paul McCartney further added to the chaos.  The conversation remained highly vulgar and lacked cohesion.


The after-show segment featured a chaotic reunion with Sandy Kane.  The conversation centered on their past legal battles, with Sandy explaining her comedic motivations for the lawsuits.  Vulgar banter ensued, referencing past incidents involving the Naked Cowboy and Sandy's legal actions.  Bobo, Mike (Bichetti), and Lady Di were also present.  Sandy Kane premiered a new country song, "Hurricane Sandy."  A planned video featuring the guests answering "What is your life's greatest accomplishment?" was repeatedly derailed by vulgar conversation. A live read for Pajamagram was punctuated by sexually suggestive comments. The show ended with calls from Joe DeRosa and a final plug for Steven Singer Jewelers.  The segment maintained the show’s highly offensive and sexually charged nature.

[00:07:30]  000 likes the the boycott a and e page well a lot of people are supporting the duck dynasty guys um  but i think a lot of people are very very confused by it yeah uh i finally had explained on my facebook  page op radio fans that i don't agree with anything the guy said i don't agree with what  phil robertson said whatsoever i i i think the complete opposite i think but he has the right  to say it i'm defending his right to say it we need to defend his right to say this period it's as 
[00:08:00]  simple as that people are so used to only defending the guys they agree with right and that's why when  you when you talk you you stick up for a guy like this the papers are saying like well conservatives  and religious groups i'm neither of those things right you know it's like you get the front page of the  paper i'm like wait a minute i'm not a conservative don't fucking lump me in there i'm a free speech  guy and he made it clear when he was saying what he said that it was just his opinion right like he  specifically said this is what i think and it wasn't even part of a and e no it was an interview for 
[00:08:30]  somebody else has nothing to do with the the reality show and i was kidding i don't give a  fuck if a tv show i like if one of the guys thinks this way who gives a fuck if i like the show i like  the show period i agree it's like i don't care what like what religion or political ideology a  baseball player is or a football player so why would i give a shit i'm sure there's terrible people in  baseball football and whatever sport you're into i don't give a fuck as long as they're not uh breaking 
[00:09:00]  any uh laws right right he's not encouraging people to go out and hurt homosexuals or you know  he's allowed to dislike him that's his opinion i don't agree with it but fuck it who cares let  him let him think what he wants and it's not even like he's acting out of character like he's a  uber religious hunter with a giant beard well one of my tweets yesterday i said uh i would like to know  what any thought his ideology was yeah what do you think they pray at the end of every show right  they wanted them to take jesus out of their prayers right and uh we they the family said 
[00:09:30]  we'll walk if you can't let us show our prayers we'll walk sure the family does church sermons  every week like they're the most religious family on television yeah and then so you get this and  then there's some part of their religion that you don't like okay fine distance yourself by saying that's  not the network's opinion but don't fucking penalize the guy because he's kind of following right  the strict tenets of his religion which i think is silly but he doesn't and this  was outside the parameters of the fucking uh duck dynasty show that's what's bothersome too 
[00:10:00]  completely so and you wait and see if anybody cares by seeing if the ratings are well no people  said hey the free market has spoken no they haven't no one you allow the show to continue and if so  many people are bothered by what phil robertson said they're going to stop watching the show and then  a and he goes look you fucked up man we got to get rid of the show because you know the ratings are  horrible right and and we could pretty much point to the fact that you said some shitty things but 
[00:10:30]  they don't even give that a chance and what scared me yesterday as we were not scared me but i was like  any will buckle because there's too many people fighting back right but then it was uh it's of  course they're owned by a parent company which is disney ouch disney won't buckle i don't think  he owns 50 percent wow okay because disney can take the hit sure but a and e's this is a big show  for them yeah on disney's fucking radar who gives it means nothing does this fall under like religious  discrimination like can you can you hire him for his religious beliefs because you can't you know 
[00:11:00]  that's a great question it's going to get complicated yeah is my answer that's a very that's  a great question he was kind of quoting the bible right well yeah i mean and in their statement they say  you know he was expressing his religious beliefs which are constitutionally you know yeah that's a  very sticky one that's why i think so many people are so angry right is that he wasn't on some anti-gay  like you know hey man gays are just awful he was quoting that's his faith the bot which again i hear  that on the outside i'm like oh how stupid how could you think that way but you can't you you can't fire 
[00:11:30]  someone for their religious belief i mean it's it's a protected right well that's why i think they went for  uh suspended maybe you're right you know they probably already knew that and now they're trying  to figure out what do we do what do we do but i mean you know his family's not going to go on with  this show without him period they don't need the money they're just not going to do it their family  is way tighter than a dumb tv show they've kind of proven that there's 1.3 million people on the 
[00:12:00]  facebook page that says boycott a and e right like a day and a half not even it's a little bit  and this is what we've uh hoped for for a long time with uh with this type of thing where the  fans finally fight back and fight against the corporation because usually this happens and  everyone just they either don't know what to do or they don't get active but in this case they're  all about it so good for everyone that uh is a duck dynasty fan i personally am not i watch it here  and there i take a peek you know but i don't there are people that love this show and people keep 
[00:12:30]  telling us like hey guys they have the right to a we know a and he has the legal right to like we're  not saying that yeah and we're bothered by that why do you want them to get like why would anybody  want him fired and the reason why they do it time and time again is because the fans don't fight back  but for once they are so maybe this will change uh some things as we move down this road and what's  crazy about the whole thing is not only are these views never reflected on the show but the show is like  the most family value show on television right they finally have a show that's promoting family 
[00:13:00]  values that a lot of people are watching and they're still just oh we gotta get him over here  a lot of people saying it's unconstitutional for a need to fire him it might they might be right  because uh it's it's not just religious but he was really quoting the bible right um and you know  it's i don't want to bash liberals for because i guess look if i was i get i understand why glad would  make a statement coming out and going look we think this is awful this guy sucks but you can't  silence the guy because you don't like him right and that's what they do is they pressure behind the 
[00:13:30]  scenes and a and he buckled instead of just saying hey we uh we don't agree with what he said but  he's allowed to let me say hi to tommy on long island tommy yeah this guy by everybody uh this guy's  getting in trouble what he said you said i think the exact opposite wasn't his big complaint that he  thought a vagina was better looking than a man's asshole he did say that yeah why yeah  oh we just said i think the exact opposite oh oh good one he didn't say that this guy goes 
[00:14:00]  it's a vagina and they they can see that's where he's not quoting the bible he goes it's a vagina  that's where though yeah get around the religion let me make it easy for you tommy i love vaginas okay  man's asshole still but enjoy vacation all right but you know i support gay fucking rights  period you like gives a fuck you like vagina but you support people's rights to  like a man's asshole better than a vagina yes exactly people are allowed to like whatever hole  they want exactly i just don't understand how why people don't like i really don't like i've thought 
[00:14:30]  of it like how what is it about gays that bothers people so fucking much and maybe because we live  where we live and we interact where we interact and we've lived the way we've lived but you know  maybe it's like you just get so used to dealing with people it's like it's nothing anymore if i'm on the  phone it's way the norm in new york city to accept it we just happen to live in an area where it's way  more acceptable i mean way more acceptable than even long island where i'm from i saw a big difference  between you know accepting it and not between those two areas but new york city they're all about it 
[00:15:00]  there's still areas though where people think it's like contagious well of course where you can be  influenced into becoming of course you know i'm not gonna sit here and try to convince those  fucking people it's insanity right that's how they feel period we could debate it i guess but you  let them be you don't want to take them out of their livelihood but they seem like like this guy  this is a real nice family unit like they seem like really nice people and that they they believe  in whatever they believe in but like why that why does that part have to come into it and be shitty 
[00:15:30]  like you you're a nice family unit and you believe in love and all this stuff right but with with this  group you don't well they believe in love as long as it's their yeah their definitional yeah  so it's kind of uh silly but there's a lot of people that think like phil robertson period so  i find it irritating and i find that i would respect any more if they would just come out and start  going after the the religious uh places that these things come from but they never will no  you can't do it so there you go that's it's a massive fucking story because the whole debate 
[00:16:00]  gets confused about whether you're whether you disagree with him or whether you disagree with  with that he can say that and we know the difference between the constant i know the  constitution does not prevent uh a and e from firing him no one people on twitter you just can't  explain it 140 characters i know that my point is why do we want it why do you want a guy you disagree  with penalize it's so stupid it's ridiculous let him say what he wants it's fucking ridiculous dude 
[00:16:30]  this guy doesn't influence me at all i don't give a fuck what he's into as long as it's a good tv  show that i'm entertained by i don't give a fuck absolutely he's not breaking any fucking laws  and they want reality and they want honesty from these people no they don't that's what you get  you know they like maybe they may believe that but they they absolutely don't want that whatsoever  uh dennis you got something for us or what wait you know what were you playing music that whole 
[00:17:00]  time no oh he's just ready in a pinch right give us one of your rants i don't know phil robertson's  not gonna like this song yeah give one to phil robertson out there this is called disco sand  a little take off on the village people it's holiday express as we get that boogie going these  guys came from new jersey yeah let's hear from the tri-state who came from new jersey holiday  express oh all right let's get that dance floor moving now no reason to be sitting down come on

[00:21:30]  What song was playing in The Godfather in the background when Luca Brasi was getting ready?  That's a very good question.  I do not know.  No, it couldn't be this.  Yeah.  What year is this from?  This is from 1963.  Oh, okay.  This is an old fucking song.  It is my favorite of all time, Dennis, so thank you very much for this one.  This is my favorite Christmas song, I'm telling you right now.  More than the Garth?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck Garth.  Don't say that.  Where the hell has he been?  He's going back on tour.  He's been on the Sam Roberts show. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, good for him.  What did you have him on?  I had him on the phone a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's good, man.  So we also have Bobo here with the donuts.  Yeah.  And also scheduled to appear today.  Oh, we have quite a list.  Lady Di.  Without Marion, though?  Just Lady Di.  Uh-oh.  We're taking this act solo.  Uh-oh.  She's ready to branch out.  Uh, Stalker Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Mike Buschetti again.  Well, thank you.  We're bringing him out real fast.  And the great Colin Quinn. 
[00:22:30]  Colin's very excited.  We're doing this whole super show for Colin Quinn.  He's probably awake already on the train or on his way.  Just biting his knuckles.  Yeah.  He can't wait to get here.  He's a hypocrisy lady.  He died.  Let's say hi to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Morning.  Merry Christmas.  Hi, Peter.  Merry Christmas, Peter.  What's up?  Uh, yeah, I'm just thinking about the hypocrisy of, uh, the media.  Time Magazine, uh, names the Pope, Man of the Year. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  But, again, the, uh, Catholic Church's view on homosexuality pretty much mirrors what Phil  Robertson said, uh, in his interview.  I mean, they see homosexuality as a sin against God and, you know, and all that.  But nobody's complaining about that.  But, again, this dopey TV show gets all this attention when it's just a, just a regular  guy expressing his opinions.  I just think it's completely, the hypocrisy of the media is just, is just, uh, it's glaring 
[00:23:30]  in this game.  You're right.  Well, certainly they have, uh, very similar views on those topics, but one guy looks like  a freaking animal, so I guess it's easier to go after him.  Right.  It's safer.  And you won't have, you can't make...  Much safer than going after the institution.  Or the Pope.  Right.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  The institution itself.  Go after the wild man that looks like he lives in the woods.  Yeah.  The TV guy.  Right.  And, and eats roadkill.  Yeah.  Guy who makes duck shit for a living.  Right.  It's so much easier to go after him than really take on the Pope on his views.  Yeah.  So, you're very, uh, you're very correct there, Peter.  Have a good Christmas, you guys. 
[00:24:00]  Thank you.  Although, as far as Popes go, I kind of like this guy.  I love this guy.  I'm not, I've not, I haven't been a fan of Popes or anything like that, but he's doing  things a little different.  Yeah, he's already, he seems like he's a, he seems like he's a genuinely humble guy.  A little different.  Maybe he'll push some things forward.  Who knows?  He made them take a statue of him down.  Right.  Somewhere, he's like, I don't want to be worshipped.  I'm not, you know, he's, they said, this really got to me too, they said he moved, he dresses  like a regular priest at night sometimes.  Right.  And goes out and ministers to the poor.  So people don't know it's him.  They don't even know it's him.  No.  They have to know it's him. 
[00:24:30]  No.  You know what?  If it's really late at night and you're dressed like a regular priest and maybe have a hat or  something, he might not be as.  Right.  You know.  Or maybe he can't do that anymore, but I kind of respected him for doing that.  Sure.  Dennis?  I want to try to win Jimmy over today, you know.  I've got to get Jimmy into the holiday spirit.  Oh, that's not fair, dude.  This will do it.  Look, now Jimmy's tapping his toes.  That's right.  Of course I am.  It's a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebration.  That's right.  What?  What?  No rant, though. 
[00:25:00]  I don't want to ruin this for Jimmy.  That was almost the perfect ramp up to it.  I don't want to ruin this for Jimmy.  You know, this may be a tease for later, but while we're talking about music, there is a  Christmas song made just for the show.  What?  By Sean F.  Well, can we hear it right now?  If you'd like to, we can hear it now.  Yeah, Sean F. had a very good year as far as this show goes.  He certainly did.  He wants to end on a high note. 
[00:25:30]  He became a star this year, this Sean F.  A household name overnight.  What is he, Mondo270 on the Twitter?  Yep.  How do I know that?  I know that because he's now a star.  And if you want to get him on SoundCloud to listen to all his great E-Rock songs, it's  Sean-F-1.  Is he getting away from the E-Rock?  I hope so.  Let's move on, Sean.  Well, this song is called No Self-Esteem, A Christmas Song by Sean F.  Oh, boy.  I can only imagine.  What do you think?  I don't think he's over the E-Rock thing yet. 
[00:26:00]  I'll have one more for the year.  All right.  He found his niche.  Sure.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Hoagies and goldfish and watching The Simpsons.  Calling out sick when he's showing no symptoms.  Sitting for hours, not doing a thing.  E-Rock's a fatso with no self-esteem. 
[00:26:30]  He's not even here.  Big fat and lazy and he's always tardy.  Only Coke Zero at his Christmas party.  That's true.  Being an asshole is kind of his thing.  E-Rock's a fatso with no self-esteem.  Dr. Who shit, flabby mantis.  Always eating crap.  He simply will eat just about anything. 
[00:27:00]  Cause E-Rock is really fat.  Bravo, Sean F.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  Bravo.  Merry holiday-ish.  Yes, of course.  Obviously, he was inspired by that live Sound of Music show.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in Louisiana.  Dave.  Merry Christmas, guys.  Merry Christmas.  Right on, man.  Hey, dude.  I'm born and raised in Louisiana, man.  And I'm going to tell you, it's not that being, there's a lot of gay community. 
[00:27:30]  There's a lot of gays in New Orleans, actually.  There's a big Mecca.  So it's not like it's unheard of there.  And I think that's the problem with our country.  I mean, God, our kids can't even say Pledge of Allegiance in freaking school anymore, man.  You know what I mean?  Whatever happens to the right of not agreeing.  And I'll use a good example.  Yesterday, you guys were bagging on Jim because he's a KISS fan.  Well, it's only his opinion.  I mean, it's nothing.  It's not like you hate him for it. 
[00:28:00]  Thank you, sir.  You have to beat the shit out of him, you know?  Yeah, we can laugh at him for having horrible musical music taste.  Of course.  But I want him to enjoy his horrible music.  You'll fight to the death for my right to listen to this.  That's right, I will.  I don't understand why you would like KISS so much, but with that said,  Yeah, you can't be an individual, Dave.  I get it.  Thank you.  And I'm a KISS fan, too, man.  So, rock out, Jim!  Thank you, buddy.  It's Peter Criss's birthday today. 
[00:28:30]  Whoa, Peter Criss's birthday.  Let me guess how old he is.  I'm going to guess he's 66.  88.  Oh, I was off.  Yeah, a little bit off.  68.  Is he?  Wow.  Yeah.  It's funny, that guy, yeah, that we just took that phone call,  because I picked up my young son at school yesterday,  and one of the teachers is done for the year.  She's starting her Christmas holiday early,  and a bunch of parents are there getting their kids,  and she goes,  Well, this is my last day.  I'm going to be going on a trip actually in an hour from now, 
[00:29:00]  so I'm not going to see you guys.  And then she said,  So happy,  so she got all flustered.  She goes,  Happy, so,  this is exactly how it went down.  Happy, well,  a good new year.  Happy new year.  New year.  And I just went,  Merry Christmas.  Jesus Christ, just say it.  The C word.  But I felt bad for her,  because she obviously has been told.  She's just a teacher in her mid-20s, 
[00:29:30]  but she couldn't say Happy Holidays.  She didn't want to say Merry Christmas,  and she pretty much had a tough time saying,  you know,  Happy New Year,  because some of the kids in the class,  I guess,  have a different new year.  They can't say Happy New Year.  They can't say Happy Holidays.  I don't know what it was about,  but she got so flustered,  because she realized,  Oh my God,  what do I say here?  Because, you know,  the parents picking up the kids,  yeah,  they weren't all,  you know,  fucking lily white like me.  You know,  you got a little diversity there.  But what's the thinking?  But I finally said,  Merry Christmas! 
[00:30:00]  And then she kind of,  she didn't say it back,  she kind of nodded,  and like,  you know,  kind of,  kind of walked away.  I can't,  did you hear what he just said?  That's right.  But I'm like,  you gotta be shitting me.  What are we doing to each other?  Everyone is afraid.  It's so silly.  It's like,  we were afraid of that awkward moment.  Well,  I'm Jewish.  Oh,  okay,  well,  Happy Hanukkah.  Yeah,  it was still well wishes.  It wasn't like it was a mean.  And wouldn't the true diversity be,  because we were discussing this in our house yesterday,  wouldn't the true diversity be to just  celebrate all the fucking holidays then?  I don't care. 
[00:30:30]  I don't give a fuck if my,  then my son learns about a Muslim holiday  or any other fucking,  I don't give a fuck.  I want him to at least,  you know,  learn the differences between the holidays  instead of let's,  let's all make believe there's no holiday.  Not one Christmas decoration in his classroom.  It's blowing my mind.  Yeah,  it's really,  in an effort to be comfortable for everyone,  they've just gone so overboard,  and like,  wipe the slate clean!  Ha ha ha!  It's like,  everybody's just panic stricken.  And this is the norm in New York City,  is the problem,  because I already feel 
[00:31:00]  I've got to get him out of that school,  to be completely honest with you.  It's a two-year program,  I think I'm going to start looking.  I can't do that to it.  I can't do it.  You should bring him to my daughter's school.  Why,  it's the complete opposite?  You know who's coming today?  Santa Claus,  right?  Santa Claus.  Oh my God,  they would lose their minds  if Santa Claus showed up at this school.  You know what they have in the lobby?  They would fucking probably take him out.  A Christmas tree.  No,  none of that,  I'm telling you.  There's one hint in the lobby,  there's some snowflakes that are hung up.  That's it.  So it could possibly be winter. 
[00:31:30]  Unless you're a celebration winter.  Classrooms,  no,  no,  no,  no.  It's like,  they're so afraid that the kid who feels isolated,  they can't just tell him,  oh,  this is what the majority of people do,  like,  you're welcome to,  there's no,  the people don't have to explain anything to anybody.  It's not good,  I'm telling you.  And,  you know,  these people are supposed to be way smarter than us.  They're not that smart.  You remember that father who called up and said that,  the story of the kid who got suspended,  and then the father went and complained,  and they immediately unsuspended the kid.  Yes. 
[00:32:00]  Everyone's so afraid of that confrontation,  or that conversation.  Everyone's so mentally lazy,  they just don't want to have it.  Well,  because,  I mean,  this is,  you know,  it's one of the nicer schools,  so I guess they're scared that maybe,  maybe the school will go well,  and your kid can't come here,  or whatever,  but who cares?  I've spoken up already.  You know,  I'm not getting any really good answers.  They refer to the handbook.  Well,  in the handbook,  it says,  it's amazing how marvelous.  I can't do this,  because a kid might be slighted.  Yuck.  Well,  if a kid is slighted. 
[00:32:30]  But no one's rubbing any of this shit in their faces.  Like,  ah,  you don't celebrate Christmas.  Can't people explain to a kid that this is,  like,  you're slighted here,  but you won't be slighted here.  Yes,  the girl didn't give you a Valentine's Day card,  but,  you'll get your math,  and you'll fucking discover Microsoft.  Yeah.  Right.  You know,  believe me,  no one who got pussy in high school  discovered fucking Microsoft,  or Apple,  or the computer.  And that motivated you to discover Microsoft,  because you were mad that there was no pussy to be had.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  It's,  it's,  uh,  I think it's too much for me and my family.  I don't know if we could,  you know,  continue down that road,  so,  we're gonna start looking elsewhere.  I,  it's,  it's so ridiculous to me.  My dad used to dress up as Santa Claus when I was in elementary school and come to school.  Really?  I just remembered when Travis said that.  Oh,  God,  the Roberts,  they're just so fucking perfect.  Every Christmas.  They're such wholesome people.  Oh,  my God.  It's awful.  That's why you shouldn't have been making fun of the jammy song.  I guarantee,  if,  if technology was better when you guys were growing up,  you, 
[00:33:30]  your,  your family would have had a jammy song.  Or if they had talent in the family.  Exactly.  They probably wouldn't have liked the risque nature of some of the lingo in the jammy song.  So I'm extremely surprised at the angle you took on that.  I would have been so,  Your mommy baked fucking personalized Christmas cookies for everybody.  Your dad dresses as Santa Claus.  Of course you guys should have made a jammy video.  Yeah,  but I would have been so embarrassed by it now.  No,  you wouldn't have.  Are you kidding me?  Secretly,  you love all this stuff.  No,  you would have loved it.  You love that mommy scrubs out the fucking shit stains in your underwear. 
[00:34:00]  She washes them by hand.  So make sure you got really nice looking underpants.  And all the semen stains out of the back.  Right.  She just washes and doesn't ask any questions.  I put my own laundry in the washing machine.  At her house.  Oh,  you do that now?  Yeah,  in my apartment.  Oh,  she doesn't do your laundry anymore.  No,  we stopped that several years ago.  What happened when you got married?  Your wife was like,  look,  we can't have her.  No,  it was even before we got married.  Jess at one point was like,  it's enough.  You're like 25,  26 years old.  But you had no awareness of that. 
[00:34:30]  And then I was like,  yeah,  you're probably right.  Maybe it is enough.  You had no awareness.  No.  I would love for my mommy to still be doing my laundry,  but you know,  it comes a time.  You got to realize how weird that is.  Sometimes somebody close to you has to say that.  If your mom is like enabling the behavior.  Right.  And that you're like,  well,  she doesn't mind doing it.  She kind of likes it.  So I don't see what the problem is.  And Jess is like,  well,  I'm going to marry you.  We live together.  You're supposed to be a man.  She's right.  She probably still says that.  I married you.  When she's trying to, 
[00:35:00]  you know,  get something done at night,  you have your fucking footie pajamas on.  Going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced this week.  What the fuck?  Let's get the party going one more time.  Bring it on.  Daryl Hall and John Oates.  Let's rock.  These two.  There's a little dance floor over there,  I think.  There's no dance floor here.  I told you that.  I want Denny to DJ a party in like Brownsville, 
[00:35:30]  New York.  There you go.  Hall and Oates.  What a big Christmas hit.  Was this a hit for them,  Denny?  Yeah.  Yeah,  this was.  Is that why it's on the hard drive?  It gets a lot of airplay this time of year.  It does.  It's one of the Christmas format staples.  Yeah.  What's your favorite Christmas song?  My favorite Christmas song.  Don't tell us.  Play it.  Oh, you want to play it?  Don't tell us.  Play it.  Tell us through the music, Denny.  Tell us through the music.  That's right.  Well,  I think if you're going to really talk about a classic,  and this might have been the one that Jimmy was talking about in the Godfather movie. 
[00:36:00]  Mr. Sinatra.  You might be right.  Let your heart.  This was a big one in the Hughes household growing up.  Is this couples only, Denny?  Slow dance, sure.  Should we turn down the music?  Turn down the lights for this one?  It's bright in here, yeah.  What year is this?  This goes back to the 1940s.  No way.  Really?  Yes, it does.  1940s.  But it doesn't sound right. 
[00:36:30]  This was in the, Judy Garland had the original from the movie Meet Me in St. Louis.  Yeah.  Meet Me in St. Louis.  What do you think?  Maybe the four of us guys each pick a partner and do some slow dancing?  What the fuck?  Why not, right?  It's Christmas.  Our troubles will be miles away.  Opie, Mars was just in the corner and he announced, I got Ope.  Did you really?  Yes.  Thank you, Mars.  Call a dibs on the Ope.  Because I got Ope.  We were all thinking it.  I love knowing that I still got it.  Thank you. 
[00:37:00]  Every one of us was looking in Ope's direction.  Who's he going to pick?  Who's he going to pick?  This might be the, what was that?  Because it was such a lonely scene.  Christmas is so fun and Luke is just packing a gun alone in a fucking shitty apartment.  Nice juxtaposition.  Yeah.  Hey, one of the participants in the super show today is Bobo.  Oh, yeah, he is.  And I heard he called the after show yesterday.  Well, yeah, we had a surprise guest on.  Jeff Gordon stopped by. 
[00:37:30]  He's a huge in the world of NASCAR.  I know, we don't really know NASCAR on this show.  No, and.  Sorry to say.  I do.  I know that disappoints a lot of our listeners because they're big into it, but.  Well, one of our listeners who's big into it is Bobo.  Yeah, I know.  He used to wear those racing jackets.  Or he still does.  Yeah, he still does.  He fucking loves Jeff Gordon.  Okay.  He's the biggest Jeff Gordon fan I've ever met.  So does he have a Jeff Gordon question yesterday?  Yeah, we called him and said, you've got to call the after show because Jeff Gordon's 
[00:38:00]  going to be on.  Okay.  And what did he say?  We got it?  Yeah, we got it.  It was.  Well, it was a Bobo question.  I want you to make somebody's dream come true here.  Awesome.  Because we have a guy who's associated with the show.  And he's been associated with the show for a few years now, who is the biggest Jeff Gordon  fan ever.  And this is legit.  I'm going to put him on the phone now.  Great.  I didn't know you were coming in today.  Otherwise, I would have had him in the studio for you to hang out with him.  I'm glad nobody told you I was coming in today.  Wow.  He's got a stuffy nose, huh? 
[00:38:30]  Trust me.  I would have been too...  Oh, no.  Hey.  How are you doing, Jeff Gordon?  This is Daniel from Queens.  Biggest Jeff Gordon fan in New York City.  I love it when he introduces himself and just says, hey, I'm making this announcement  right here before you guys even come to me or ask me a question.  And you know why he's taking it seriously?  Because we know him as Bobo.  Yeah, he's Bobo.  But when he's around you, he's Daniel from Queens.  He wants you to know.  I can't call you Bobo?  Well, that's just a name I go by on the show. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay, but that's not...  That's your alias.  It's not your real NASCAR fan being when you're at home.  Yep, exactly.  I just heard of him who's the biggest Jeff Gordon fan in the city of New York.  Awesome.  So, Bobo, you have Jeff Gordon here.  Here's your opportunity.  What's your one question for Jeff?  Don't mess it up.  Well, one thing I've been wanting to ask is that, is there ever going to be a chance  they're going to bring NASCAR into New York City one of these days?  Oh, my goodness.  Bobo, you could ask anybody that question. 
[00:39:30]  That's a terrible question.  If we can get the Meadowlands to build a track out there, that's as close as we're going  to get to New York City.  You know, I would love to see the skyline of New York as the backdrop of a NASCAR race,  and so would NASCAR.  And you know what?  You've got to find a place to drive the cars.  There are far more NASCAR fans here in New York than anybody realizes.  You know, it's just that it's not all the top, you know, marketing executives and people 
[00:40:00]  that, you know, love stick and ball sports, especially New York stick and ball sports.  So, you know, we have our nice niche and love to hear some loud roaring of NASCAR engines  out there to track somewhere.  But we've got to build a track first.  Yeah, you need to drive the car.  We're not going to be racing through Central Park.  Bobo, he's on it.  Don't worry.  Yeah, you blew it, Bobo.  Real quick, before you go, Bobo, I wanted to ask you to tell Jeff Gordon, what is your 
[00:40:30]  dog's name?  No, no.  Yeah, my dog's name is Mr. Maloonican.  He's a schnoodle.  All right.  I thought his name is Jeff Gordon.  No.  Thank you, Bobo.  He should have lied and said that, Jeff.  Yeah, no, it's Mr. Maloonican.  Much worse than anything you could imagine.  What did he say, a doodle?  He's a schnoodle.  Schnoodle.  Of course he is.  Oh, Jesus.  Jeff Gordon seems like a nice man, though.  Yeah.  It was the most polite way you could possibly say whenever there's a track. 
[00:41:00]  There's no track.  Of course we can't race in New York.  Of course.  Let me translate.  Jeff Gordon was saying, where do you think, asshole?  There's nowhere to do it here.  But he's just a nice guy.  How about never?  Yeah.  No place to drive the cars.  Are they going to build a track to connect the Freedom Tower to other tall buildings in  race?  No, stoop.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Today, it's Bobo, Lady Di, Stalker Patty, Mike Machete, and Colin Quinn.  It's a super show for our last show of the year. 
[00:41:30]  Dennis, take us to break here.  You've got to talk, though.  I would like to wish you and you and you and everybody at home listening to us this  morning on the Opie and Anthony Festival, and especially Mars, who helped us out.  Feliz Navidad.  Oh, that's crazy.  You told me you didn't want me to, you know, this is a Latin flavor Christmas song.  But what's-  Jose Feliciano and Mars helped me out this morning with the setup.  The Opie and Anthony Festival?  Yeah, a little festival.  A holiday festival.  Festival of lights.  Festival?  Oh, can you just say Christmas?  Well, I don't want to offend anyone. 
[00:42:00]  I don't want to offend anyone.  Jesus Christ.  You got another one?  Because I fucked it up.  Oh, that's okay.  Oh, this-  Oh, come on.  This one.  This one.  Time to bring in the chipmunks.  What's that?  Dave Saville.  I know you know the words, so let me hear you sing along.  Let's go.  Oh.  Okay, Theodore.  Oh.  Okay, Alvin.  Alvin.  Alvin!  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents 
[00:42:30]  A Visit from St. Nicholas.  Narrated by Big A and Stalker Patty.  Twas, twas, twas the night before Christmas  when all through the house  Not a creature  Was  Not even a mouse 
[00:43:00]  Um, let's  Let's  Let's  Let's  Let's  Let's  Hawkins 
[00:43:30]  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  By the chimney  With a care  In hopes  That St. Nicholas  Soon  Will be here  I mean  Will be there  The children  Were nestled  All snug in their beds  While visions of sugar plums  Danced in their heads  And Mama  In her kerchief  And I am my cap  Had to settle our brains  For a long winter's nap 
[00:44:00]  When I  Uh  Went out on the  Thorn  There rose  In such a clatter  The moon on the breast of the new falling snow gave luster of midday to objects  And  And  And  And  And  And  Threw up 
[00:44:30]  And threw up the sash  The moon on the breast of the new falling snow gave luster of midday to objects  Below  When what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer  With a little old driver  So lively and quick  I knew in a moment  It must be  Be  St. Nick  More rapid than eagles 
[00:45:00]  His  His  His  His  Corsers  They came  And he  Whistled and shouted  And called them  By name  Now Dasher  Now Dancer  Now Prancer  And Victim  On Comet  On Cupid  On Donner  And Blitzen  To the top of the porch  To the top of the wall  Now dash away  Dash away  Dash away all  As  As dry  As dry leaves  Before the wild hurricane fly 
[00:45:30]  When they meet  With an obstacle  Mount to the sky  So up to the housetop  The horses  They flew  With a sleigh full of toys  And St. Nicholas  To 
[00:46:00]  And then  In the twinkling  I heard on the rope  The prancing  And pawing  Of each little hoop  As I drew on my head  And was turning around  Down the chimney  St. Nicholas  Came with a bounce  Ah  Fuck  He was dressing all  He was dressed  All in fur  From his head  To his  Foot  And his clothes  All tarnished  With ashes 
[00:46:30]  And soot  A bundle of toys  He had flung  On his back  And he  And he  And he  Looked like  A peddler  Just opening  His pack  His eyes  How they twinkled  His dimples  How merry  His cheeks  Were like roses  His nose  Like a cherry  His droll  Little mouth  Was drawn up  Like a bow  And the beard  Of his chin  Was as white  As the snow  Of the  Of the 
[00:47:00]  Of the  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  Thump  Of a pipe  And he held  Tight in his teeth  And the smoke  Encipled his head  Like a wreath  He had a broad face  And a little round belly  And chuckled when he laughed 
[00:47:30]  Like a bowl full of jelly  He was chubby and plump  A right jolly old elf  And I laughed when I saw him  In spite of myself  A wink of his eye  And a twist of his head  Soon gave me  To know I had nothing to dread  He spoke not a word  But went  But went 
[00:48:00]  But went  Straight  To his work  And filled all his  And filled all  And filled all  The  Harkings  And turned 
[00:48:30]  A jerk  And laying his finger  Aside of his nose  And giving a nod  Up the chimney  He rose  He sprang to his sleigh  To his team  Gave a whistle  And away they all flew  Like the Dan of a thistle  But I heard him  Explain  Ere he drove out of sight  Happy Christmas  To all  And to all  A good night  This concludes 
[00:49:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show's  Version of  A Visit from St. Nicholas  If you lasted  All the way through it  Congratulations  The Opie and Anthony Show  Continues  Funky  Funky  You know I know  You're sitting there  And you just want to get up  So it's time for the  Cha-cha slide  Let me hear you  Get those hands together  Come on now  Clap  Clap  I told you  There's no dance  All you need to know  Is you're right from your left  Very simple  Yeah  There's no dance floor  We're not doing the dance floor today  I like having a dance floor though  There's no dance floor

[01:02:00]  Where is she?  Is she out?  Yeah Marion  Will you explain this fender bender please?  What happened?  You're driving  And you'll  I was driving  And I was controlled with a car  And I hit the curb  Did you get distracted?  Were you texting?  What happened?  No I was not  You don't just drive  And all of a sudden  The car gets away from you  How fast were you going?  What happened was  The sun was in my eyes  And I didn't see  A curb  Oh a curb came up  That's all  It was a curb 
[01:02:30]  A curb thing  So you just plowed stupidly  Straight ahead to a curb  Was you blinding this?  I didn't get hurt  Didn't hurt nobody  Thank god  You just hurt the car  That's all  The car guy from Fast and Furious  Is dead and she lives on  Right  I wasn't speeding or nothing  I was going  I was just the son of my eyes  Have you guys  Have you guys vetted this story?  This is not just some flimsy excuse  Not to come in  I know  No she's got to work  She's responsible  She's at work  But Colin  Very good news  Lady Di  She's all dressed up 
[01:03:00]  As you can see  I see that  We told her to get dressed up  And that means wearing  A Jim Norton t-shirt  And what's the jacket from?  The jacket?  It's cold outside  Oh where is it from?  What is that logo?  This used to be Marion's jacket  She gave it to me  Oh  The Newark Bears jacket  Nice  This is what she thinks  Is being dressed up  For Paul McCarty  She's going to meet Paul McCarty  What?  Really?  Yep  I love it  I love it  I would love to meet him  Yep

McCartney is no Bon Jovi  Right  She's a true Jersey girl  Yeah she really is  Marion how fast were you going  When you hit the curb  You think?  I was going about 20  But I didn't  That's not an accident  When you're going 20 
[01:04:00]  Exactly  She's got a need for speed  She lost control of the car  Just a line of angry people  Behind her all laughing  When she went straight  They're all bearing left  Old fucking hippo  Plows straight ahead  With her Simpsons wig  Who loses control of a car  Going 20 miles an hour?  An ox  That's who  I didn't see the car  That was in front of me  Oh no  The sun  Oh the sun  Right  You guys never got into a car accident 
[01:04:30]  Good point Marion  Yeah good car  I wish it was like a Thelma and Louise moment  I got into a car accident  I bet you did  I'm only saying  I really  What kind of car accident  What happened?  Make sure your story's better than Marion's  Now were you driving  Or were you in the trailer  With your head out the back?  I was driving  Well give us the details  Usually it would happen on a highway  Why would you wait?  What Marion?  What a catastrophe  What are you guys going on vacation? 
[01:05:00]  Hold on with the pertinent questions  Well that's an amazing question  We're two days from Christmas  Why don't you try to figure it out?  Yeah  Churchill was going to tell his car accident story  Right  Go on a cruise  What?  She's going on another cruise  Right  She did already  She had an accident  Great  And I'm going again  That's great  Lady Di  Tell us about your car accident  Usually they happen  Where's your cruise?  Usually they happen on highways 
[01:05:30]  They happen  Usually  Usually they happen  I have done maybe two cars  Nine out of ten times  But I was in the middle of a gymnasium  After I crashed through the wall  Ninety percent of the time  You're on highways  Why are you counting?  I'm counting the accidents that I had  Oh boy  She's up to four  I'm right here  She's up to four  No no no  I had three accidents  Right  No  What was your best accident?  My best one? 
[01:06:00]  When I wrecked my Pontiac Firebird and it was totaled  Oh yeah  What happened?  What are the details?  Oh god  Why can't these people get details?  I saw that one  It was called fucking Smokey and the Bandit 2  What kind of details?  I ran into another car  Don't tell Louise  I ran into an SUV  Why?  Why did you run into the SUV?  The P-I-G  Because the SUV  I should be coming  What?  Do you want me to explain the detail?  Yes  Thank you  The Pontiac Firebird  My car 
[01:06:30]  Okay  I was going down the street called South Avenue  And all of a sudden the SUV was  You know came right in front of me  Eastbound a down  Looted up  Oh you T-boned him  Did he go through a light?  No  There was no light there  So whose fault was it?  Actually it was both our faults  I'm serious  It was both our faults  Okay fair enough  You know because this lady  She just came out of nowhere from a driveway  And caught my hitter  So how many beers did you have that day?  You can tell us  Oh I don't remember  It was a long time ago 
[01:07:00]  She doesn't know whose fault it was  But  I can't remember how many beers she had  But it was both our faults  Yeah it's both our faults  You drunkenly  Go ahead  It's your turn already  Why would you wait while someone's talking?  What'd you say?  And then when you ask what  Nothing  You're like a fucking cannonball in a Hummel store  This was a while ago  Alright but  Marion what?  That was a very long time ago  That she did that 
[01:07:30]  Oh  Thank you  Well obviously she's changed her life since then  I missed my firebird  So obvious to all of us  I do miss that car  I'm sure  I'm sure  It's in a better place  Believe me  Yeah  I do miss that car  You miss it?  So did you get hurt in the accident?  No  So go visit it at the junkyard  No one got hurt in the accident  Nobody got hurt  Are you glad the car got totaled?  No  Did your airbag go off  Or did you use your big belly?  I didn't have it  It's a 1984 firebird  I didn't have any airbags in it  No airbags  So the belly  The belly helped you  Probably saved you  Yeah maybe 
[01:08:00]  Could be  Did the cops show up?  Uh no  Why?  That sounds like an accident  The cops should have been  You probably had the insurance covered  And everything right?  Yeah  Were you happy or sad?  Oh yeah  I was sad that I lost my car  You were?  Yeah  Did you miss it?  Yes  Oh  What about the beer in your hand?  Were you able to save that?  I don't drink and drive like that  I don't  Like that  Like that  She takes you literally  Like I don't tip my head back  Right  What's that?  Save me  Save me  Oh Lady Di  You're doing great

She's got the text  From who? 
[01:22:00]  Hi Kenny  Clubby  Oh what's up Clubby  Clubby said he's not happy  She'll be fine  Doesn't think it's a good idea  Why?  How you doing Mike?  Oh because why?  Why?  Mike  It's in line with everything else we do isn't it?  You're talking to a photo on a computer screen  What are you doing?  I think she  She's right between the lines  He can hear me  He can hear me out there  Somebody's missing  Oh  Bobo and Bichetti  Mike and Bobo can hear me  She yelled at the computer  How you doing Mike?  No she's waving at the computer 
[01:22:30]  Like that's video  Like it's a video phone  Like live  Yeah  It's not a video  It's just a photograph  I know  Would you go out with Mike Bichetti?  No  I don't think so  Why?  Just sex?  I don't know  Just casual sex  What's the matter with you?  I mean I don't know  I don't know  I don't know the guy that well  You're two melons in a pod  Oh  You're saving yourself for Colin right?

Kenny texted  I don't think it's a good idea 
[01:23:30]  It's the season for  Kenny  Forgiving  It's a voice of reason  Right  How many more times  Do you want to go down  To the courthouse?  That's kind of entertained  To be honest with you  Because guess what?  Getting out of here is easy  Getting out of here is hard  Right  I personally think  That if she calls up  And says look  I want to come back in  I don't think there'll be an issue  Because she's calling  Requesting to come in  And you know  How about the fact  That when I got there  To check in  The girl behind this goes  Naked cowgirl  Was just here  Trying to get up 
[01:24:00]  Oh really?  So they know  See?  She's made a name for herself  Yeah  I think it's hilarious  That she just called the show  She sued us  We had to go down  To the courts three times  They finally gave up  On the case  Because she wouldn't show  Yeah  And she admitted  That she's a bitter bitch  That's hilarious to me  I'm busy man  I'm busy man  She's been  She's had some rough times  You know  She can be very entertaining  Yeah  When she's talking to hot girls  And critiquing their bodies  There's nothing that makes me happier  That was funny  Than her shitting on hot chicks  That was a good one 
[01:24:30]  She's the best  She'll shit on Lady Di  Which will be fun too  Oh boy  Kenny I think we have to do this one  It's the last show of the year  We have to  Take care of yourself man  Right  It's up to you  You just can't help yourself  I'll never forget that song  That she sang about Jerry Seinfeld  What song?  That song she sang about Jerry Seinfeld  Jerry  Jerry baby  That one  Oh yeah  That was a while ago  That was a good one  Yeah  No one knows what you're saying 
[01:25:00]  Jerry  Jerry baby  Dennis take us a break  We'll figure this shit out  I'm pretty sure  I'm pretty sure it was that  Talk to us  I know you said there's no dance floor  But in my mind  There's always a dance floor  So we gotta keep this party going  With one of the biggest songs  Of this past year  Robin Thicke  And those blurred lines  And Pharrell is in the house  On the Opie and Anthony  Christmas party celebration  The Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM

[01:26:30]  On O&A show  And she  She  Colin says  She looks like a little kid  You look like a little kid  It's O&A show  On Twitter  O&A show  Sorry  Yes  On Twitter  And don't forget  That Lady Di  Has a plug she has to get in  What?  Yeah I do  I have a plug I gotta give in  What happened?  Rich Voss is gonna be at  Yakov's tonight  What?  Rich Voss  But we're not talking about  Rich Voss  How did this come about?  Yeah what the fuck?  He told me on Twitter  Fucking Rich  Fucking Rich is using 
[01:27:00]  Rich is using you  To plug his gigs  I don't see him as using me  I just  I'm just doing a favor  That's kind of brilliant  Fucking Voss  That's too smart for Rich  I think  Yeah that's probably  That's too smart  That might have been Bonnie  He knew I was coming  On the show  So  Who didn't  Yeah  The word was out  That you were coming in today  It's a big deal  For everybody  Yeah I know  And you were talking  About exercising  I noticed  Oh boy  During the break  What was that again?  Three years after I had my son  I started to jog  Okay  Every other day 
[01:27:30]  Around 8 miles  Where to the deli?  Oh I'm serious  I started to jog  And I lost a lot of weight  Just by doing that  So then what happened?  Yeah  Isn't your son  Like 20 something years old?  My favorite drink back then  Was vodka  And I used to drink at night  It was not beer  Not in a day like now  So this is what happens  When you drink a lot of beer  Right  Um  Dennis to you  Got a little Jay-Z to rock this out  I know Sam the man loves some Jay-Z  Yeah  The Panjom EMC is in the house  Beware the boys  The nephew's in the house  Yeah

[01:29:30]  Couldn't be less amused  Very festive  That's the first time I ever saw you smile  And give me shelter  When the hell's angels watching me  Kenny really doesn't want us to have Sandy Cain on the show  He's nervous that's all  Kenny he's on record saying  Kenny  As the main security guy here  That we should not have Sandy Cain  This is a hunch Kenny has  Police hunch  Kenny's gut is telling us all  We gotta pat her down at least  Although she probably laughs at that 
[01:30:00]  Because she can make a weapon on anything  Yeah  Also Sam  What are you saying about this tale or broad?  Well we've had her  We had her in last on Tequila and Donut Day  But she does a show called Wake Up with Taylor on Starz  Oh I remember her  Yeah  She's got an open door policy today  She's posted flyers and stuff in the hallways  She's doing her own Christmas party on the air  Okay  And she wants everybody to stop by  So I figured I'd bring Lady Di over  Absolutely  Oh he's got the flyer there  We're gonna bring you to another radio show

[02:08:30]  Shut up  And that was my way of making money  And it was your journey  You were a naked cowgirl  I'm a naked cowgirl  So he started like  Fuck, fuck  I went  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck  It's on the internet  It's a big YouTube  Sandy, you might be my favorite person on the face of the planet  Yeah  Oh, great  Thank you, Taylor  And I like you, too  But yeah  She's got to show Twato  Tell me about yourself  Someone tell Sam  She's got to show Twato  I'm Patty  I'm from Staten Island 
[02:09:00]  And I was helping out on the radio station  When I met them  You know, for something  Like an event that was going on  Where were you sleeping?  Oh, yeah  Oh, God  Sam's questions always scare me  Well, about 10, 12 years ago  I was out of the apartment  And living with friends  And I decided to do like a contest on the show  Where you had to get naked and pick up money  And I was needing money at the time 
[02:09:30]  And this is not my personality  Something I normally do  But I said, let me try and see what I can do  And, you know, the friends didn't like that  And because of that, I, you know, couldn't stay with them anymore  Patty, you're a great storyteller  Are you like a warm-up guy from Night Night?  And I ended up kind of like without a place to live  Fucking droning  And, you know, before I went to live in a shelter for six weeks  Oh, girl, you should go with Sam  You know, and then I did a couple of  But the first couple of nights 
[02:10:00]  So that I'm not streetwise  Wait, Patty, look what's going on  Sorry to interrupt the story  There's a lot happening in the studio  Excuse me  Oh, Twato and Taylor  Tara Twato  I like you so much  But we need to have some sort of boundaries  Oh, it's so close, Taylor  Yeah, we need an electric fence, Taylor 
[02:10:30]  Because that thing is on you  Show her, show her, Pat  Don't show me  Wait, Taylor, think about this  Why don't you describe it?  It's any, you're a woman of words  I can tell  Just look at it once  I believe you can describe it even better  Than I could even understand it visually  This is something you've never seen before  Right, and you'll never see again  I don't know that I can do this today  But it's a Christmas party  How did I get Twato?  One day I shaved my pussy  I was working at a strip club on 47th and 8th in Las Vegas  And everyone had their pussies shaved 
[02:11:00]  So I shaved mine  And Twato came up  And I never shaved my pussy again  I can't  Sandy, we're just having so much fun and connecting  And if I see your vagina, it's going to ruin everything  I can't believe it  I can't wait for you to see it  It's crazy  It looks like a little penis  Yes  It's bigger than Bobo's 
[02:11:30]  It's a genital wart  Is that what it is?  Yes, it's a genital wart  They showed I was going to die from it  Oh, but you're not  Okay, Sandy, can I finish my story?  She's a little dick  You've got to get back to the story  You've got to get back to it  She didn't get the whole story  No, no  Okay, thank you, Sandy  I appreciate it  Yeah  But anyway  I'm probably going to lice all my whole body when you leave 
[02:12:00]  You didn't touch it  It made me nervous, Sandy  That was horrible  You should get it removed  Why not?  But why?  Why not, but why?  Well, I mean, great question  There's got to be a few reasons why, right?  How does it work when you're, like, getting romantic and making love to a gentleman?  Well, what was horrible  A blind gentleman  No, what was horrible was I had to work as a naked dancer at Show World  With Twato?  Yeah, with the fucking wart on my fucking pussy 
[02:12:30]  And it was really, it was embarrassing, to be honest  But I, you know, got to make a living  And, um, the guys would look  And so they just don't know if they pussy  They didn't give a fuck  Wow, daddy's a true story  I mean, we do things to make money in our lives  And I'm a Jewish American princess  And let me tell you  It wasn't easy doing the shit I've been doing  You know, Taylor  The sexual history of Sandy Cain and Stalker Patty are very different 
[02:13:00]  You haven't asked Stalker Patty anything about the men that she's been with  Okay, Stalker Patty  None  Zero  You're a virgin?  Yes  I love you!  I love virgins!  And I'm fine with it  I'm happy with it  I'm comfortable with it  What's wrong with it?  Why do you become a nun?  You've done the hardest part  Well, I'm not into that  I'm not a big religious person  See, I love Dick  I love Dick  He's sweeter than ice cream  He's sweeter than ice cream  I went with a dick  I have a famous dick in my life 
[02:13:30]  And no, people don't realize  Like you've hooked up with a lot of famous men?  Dick Sean  Do you remember Dick Sean?  No  Dick Sean, he was in The Producers  Or Patty  He was in Mad Mad World  No one ever knows Dick Sean?  No  No, no, no  He hasn't come up in this show in a long time  He hasn't come  But anyway  He hasn't come up  He was impotent, by the way  But  He really was  He used to take amyl nitrate  So you don't know Dick Sean?  No  I guess  I don't know you know Dick Sean  Maybe he's not as big as you thought he was 
[02:14:00]  He's very impotent  Very impotent  But he has some sass on you  I like that  A virgin with some sass  I like that she's a virgin  I'm not  But I like that you're a virgin  Well, I wouldn't think so, Taylor  You're so hot and gorgeous  You know what  And bold  Yes, well, thank you  You're bold, girl  And you were at the same fucking time  You just nailed me  Yes  See, we're best friends again  Stay over there  Yeah, but fucking Twato  But you're not a lesbian or anything  Rosie O'Donnell would have liked it

They don't like this company  I don't know  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm just nervous right now  It is very ugly  It's all I'm saying  I had to work with you  We've become the conscience of the show  In the clubs  Yeah  And it was embarrassing  Aw  It was embarrassing  But then you paid dues to be where you are, Taylor  Yeah  Not like that 
[02:15:00]  But yeah  Okay  Yeah  Alright  You didn't blow anyone for the job?  No  No  Okay  No  Okay  It happens  It does happen  It does  Not for me  But it happens  Okay  Let me just finish my story  The one about the friends and the competition  And the naked and the living in that shelter  Well, anyway  I'm not street wise in the least  And don't know anything about that  So  Before I was able to get into like a temporary place  You know  Oh my god  You gotta hurry up

[02:41:30]  Where do you hang out in Times Square?  Where are you going?  46 and Broadway.  46 and Broadway.  Okay, I've seen that a couple times.  Oh, that's fascinating.  Really adding a lot.

[02:42:00]  Marion, I got to do it.  How's that pussy feeling?  Well, he's...  Why?  Well, he heard your...  Come on.  He heard your pussy's leaking or something.  Right, Bobo?  Not me.  Hey, I'm not leaking.  That's Diana.  I want to have the leaking problem.  That's Diana.  I want to have the leaking problem.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  She don't...  I ain't got the leaking problem.  You better clear that up, because everyone thinks you have the leaky pussy.  Right.  Not me.  It's Lady Di, huh?  Yeah.  She's the one that's got the problem, not me.  Have you squirted today at all, Lady Di? 
[02:42:30]  Have you filled your underpants with custard?  No, I'm not squirted today at all.  She's the one that gets nervous.  Huh?  She's the one that gets nervous.  No, the only time I got nervous is when I came into the city and I was taking a cab,  and I'm like, 1221 Avenue of the Americas.  But Diana, last time we were there, you got nervous.  That's what you said.  Don't get nervous.  Yeah, I know.  I'm in my party.  Please don't.  Somebody needs a fuckberry to their afro.  Fuckberry to their afro.  I got nervous coming up here. 
[02:43:00]  Huh?  I got nervous coming up here because I wasn't sure where I was going.  Oh, God.  Stop peeing every five minutes.  She won.  What?  Stop peeing every five minutes.  These two bitches don't shut the fuck up.  Somebody's getting D-bagged.  I'm not peeing at all.  Get your bladder checked.  Yes, I already had it checked.  Wait, you pee every five minutes?  Diana, you sound like you're peeing every five or ten minutes.  No, that's only when I drink beer.  Okay, what's the other day?  I'm drinking beer right now.  I told you, go for the wine. 
[02:43:30]  I'm going to try to go for something else than that.  I'm going to try to go for something else.  Wait, her best friend is telling her how to solve her alcoholism is to go to the wine?  Go to the wine.  Oh, okay.  Red wine and club soda.  Red wine and club soda.  Instead of beers all day.  We have two bottles of wine at home.  One is in the refrigerator, and the other one is under the sink, under the kitchen.  What a classy joint.  This does not allow me to have quite an inane, useless babble that goes on between these two. 
[02:44:00]  Why don't you just go ahead and drink my cup with club soda?  Are you married?  No, I'm not married.  Oh, what a surprise.  What happened to your husband?  What happened to my husband?  I divorced him.  Oh.  What about the father of your son?  What happened to him?  What actually happened to him?  What happened to him?  Don't start that again.  That was so long ago.  What was that?  He started.  Yeah, guys, this is the holiday.  Don't, don't. 
[02:44:30]  Well, what happened?  Just because who dat doesn't know.  Yeah, I don't know that shit.  Hey, who dat?  Hey, what's up?  What up, nigga?  What up?  Hey, buddy.  What up?  What's up?  How you been?  I'm drinking some of the dyes to rock here.  Yeah.  Hey, what about Joey?  Is it marrying that girl that said nigga?  Don't start that again, please.  Why?  Don't start that.  That's my girl.  Oh, shit.  Obviously, the girls have talked about that. 
[02:45:00]  Lady Di, what's the problem with that?  Tell me, what happened?  Why do you want us talking about that?  That's money, a business.  That's money, a business.  Oh, man needs to know.  I have no comment.  That is, that is none of your business.  Does that cause kind of a problem with Marion, you think, saying the N-word?  Oh, bro.  You guys don't need to know, so let's not go down.  Oh, wow.  It's a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.  Two, by the way.  Huh?  Two, by the way.  Tell us, chicken shit.  How did you almost get in trouble?  Yeah, you have no one to get in trouble with.  You have no one to get in trouble with. 
[02:45:30]  You have no one to get in trouble with.  Even on Twitter called me all kinds of names.  It doesn't matter.  They call everyone names.  Right?  That's Twitter.  Hold on one second.  Hold on, Marion.  Marion, hold on.  Take the headphones off, Ty.  Maybe one or two people.  Ty, take the headphones off.  All right.  Now, Marion, I can't hear you.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah.  No, it's none of your business.  With what?  With people on Twitter?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, we can't hear you.  One person called me a racist.  No, what happened with Marion?  What the heck happened?  You got a bunch of threatening calls from Sharpton?  Well, we didn't get any threatening calls from anybody.  What happened with Marion?  What happened with Marion?  I can't hear you.  Well, she works with a lot of black people at work. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, she got in trouble?  Oh.  You know, and it was not comfortable for her.  Oh.  Well, who was playing that clip for the people at Sharpton?  Where the heck does Marion work a Popeye's?  They do be bad niggas over there.  Oh, they're not just a Popeye.  A location with bulletproof glass in front of the cashier.  Oh, man.  No, no.  You don't want to talk about it. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, but it was a one-day niggas thing.  Yeah, it was just one-day niggas every day.  Right, every day.  Okay, put your headphones back on.  I'm American here.  Yeah, it was a good day.  Put your headphones back on.  Holy shit.  Right, right.  All right, Marion, we got to the bottom of it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know she ain't racist.  Marion?  Oh, no.  That was so long ago.  That was back in the summertime, so.  Yeah, that's a real long ago.  Marion?  Marion.  Okay.  So they blew your spot up there.  Yeah, she kind of blew up your spot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  No, Marion shouldn't worry.  We got a white guy in the studio.  He gave you the pass that day.  Who dad?  Who dad said it was all right that day, remember?  Racist is the nicest thing you can say about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about it.  Keep it in the pan.  Keep it in the pan.  Can I let her know that the number one record in the country is called My Nigger?  Yeah.  By YG.  That's the number one record.  Yeah.  There you go, Marion.  So you're cool.  I sing that shit every day.  Yeah.  You do?

I brush my teeth to that shit.  Even Bobo's down with his nose, man.  I brush my teeth.  Come on, man.  Holy fuck.  Bobo's a nigga now.  Oh, God.  Man, that's funny.  Oh, wow. 
[02:48:00]  You look like a funny-looking nigga, though.  Oh, yeah, Bobo.  Bobo.  Oh, look at that.  Lady God's rubbing Colin's back.  Oh.  That's good.  You should reciprocate.  Yeah, do you want...  You wanted to go out on a date with Colin, right?  Sure, why not?  I think Colin's about ready for this.  Okay.  Yeah.  You ready for that Christmas moisture?  Oh, that'd be nice, right?  Yipes.  Yeah.  What's all the bite marks on your arms?  Uh-oh.  Who?  Mom or hers?  She got hungry.  This over here?  She got hungry.  I don't know. 
[02:48:30]  A fly bit me one time.  A fly bit me.  Let me see.  What can I tell you?  A fly bit me?  Wait, let me see.  Where are they?  It's probably a bed bug fight.  Oh, no, bees fly.  Oh, yeah.  You play a bed bug.  Or fleas.  Like a wasp.  Marion's done.  She hung up on us.  She's mad at you.  Yeah.  She's mad at you.  Hey, what did I do?  She told...  I don't know.  She said to me that she's pissed off at you and she hung up.  Okay.  You told the story about the black people she works with and how mad they were. 
[02:49:00]  Keep that shit to yourself.  At Popeyes.  Right.  At Popeyes.  Well, call it back.  No, I don't think that's a good idea.  Yeah, you got bed bugs?  What?  You got bed bugs.  You might have bed bugs.  If I do, I don't know about it.  That's a bed bug bite.  Okay.  Let me see.  Or fleas.  A bed bug should be the first thing.  A flea.  It's like a flea.  It would take you.  No, with the other arm.  I thought you'd be able to sniff him out, Roscoe.  Are you shooting up heroin?  No, no, no.  I don't shoot.  I don't shoot.  No, they're not.  They're fly bites?  Yeah.  Those are bed bug bites. 
[02:49:30]  No, they're too big.  It's flies.  Flies.  Flies.  And some flies come in.  Oh.  Where do you live in?  Fuck on the Serengeti?  Oh, no.  I live in Elizabeth.  She answers it really.  No, no.  I don't live in the Serengeti.  I'm glad you cleared that up with a real answer.  They smell the pile of shit.  Fuck on the Serengeti don't bite.  Wait.  Oh, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You look like the story, child, but you look like Sally Struthers.  A fly doesn't bite.  What?  No. 
[02:50:00]  Stalker Patty does not like Lady Di.  They just land on you and go, but they don't bite.  How do you know?  How do they eat?  They bite.  How do you eat?  Yeah, you little fly.  Anything that would give you a scar like that would be a mosquito.  A bed bug.  All right.  All right.  A mosquito.  And it was a mosquito.  Not in the winter, it's not.  It's a bed bug.  You have fucking bed bugs.  Look at her arms.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Lady Di, let me see.  On your right arm.  You have bed bugs.  Let me see the back of your arm.  Yeah, there's a lot of bites.  You're fitting up pretty good.  Those are bed bugs.  Those are bed bugs.  Yeah, bed bugs.  I'll check when I come home, okay? 
[02:50:30]  When I go home, I check.  When I come home.  That's a mild case of a skin rash.  That's all it is.  Yes.  Caused by bed bug teeth.  Maybe you got eczema, seborrhea, or psoriasis.  Maybe you got the shingles.  Congenital warch.  Can we talk to Patty?  Because Patty really doesn't like Lady Di.  Oh, she's holding back.  Patty, what's going on?  Let it all out.  She bothers you, though, right?  I don't dislike anyone.  I'm just a little surprised at you that after all these years, you still haven't found employment. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, boy.  Even though you keep saying you are.  I'm a little disappointed in you.  Comment, comment, Lady Di.  I don't know why she's a lazy fuck.  Fuck, yeah.  I'm still looking.  It's not that easy.  Especially where I live at.  Ten years.  It ain't that easy.  You have to go out of where you live.  It's not that easy because you're drunk.  I started in the city.  You know.  You have to go out of your neighborhood then.  Right, yeah.  You take the bus.  Holy fuck.  What do you think, Patty?  I don't need to take the bus.  Why?  I have a car.  Oh, jeez.  You can't fit on it. 
[02:51:30]  You scare every potential employer every time you say, and I'll show you my boobs.  Oh, man.  Boobs.  I don't know what to say anymore.  Yeah.  Well, Patty's really giving me the business.  Patty is, uh.  I don't know.  That's fine.  She's not happy with you.  I'm still looking for her job.  She doesn't like lazy people.  Yeah, Patty.  Patty's not lazy.  I can't tell you, I can't imagine waking up and not going to work.  Oh, man.  You know, it's just something you look forward to every day. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That's something I look forward to every day.  Real shit.  And Patty, I want to acknowledge you dressed really nice for our Christmas party.  I noticed.  Very nice little glittery sequined shirt.  Well, I'm going out of town today.  Whoa.  Where are you going?  I'm going to go to my brother's house.  An older brother.  He, you know.  He's probably going to get that dick.  Where is he?  He's in, uh, he's in, uh, New Jersey.  Wow, you're really.  South Jersey.  South Jersey.  Oh, so you are traveling.  He had a stroke, you said?  No. 
[02:52:30]  Well, he did, you know, and he's, you know, he's doing much better, so I can't wait to see  how he is.  That's a nice little holiday.  What's going on?  He's about nine or ten years older than me.  Oh, shit.  Is he a virgin, too?  I don't know.  Well, he must not be, because I have two nephews.  Wahoo-hoo-hoo.  Okay.  Fucking Patty.  What are those, Uggs?  What are you wearing?  Just plain boots from Kmart.  Cheap Uggs, you know, but I don't mind.  No, you're looking good.  You got glitter on your very holiday-like. 
[02:53:00]  Thank you.  What'd you say, Bubba?  See, I'd make a nephew with Patty.  Oh, boy.  What are you talking about?  He'd make a nephew with Patty.  I think he's implying he'd stick his fucking excuse for a cock in her.  That probably wouldn't work.  Well, it's not going to work, because it's never going to happen.  Whoa!  Denied!  But it's okay to dream.  Oh, wow.  Look at the confidence on Patty now.  She's fucking working. 
[02:53:30]  She's been working for years.  It's not like, you know, that lazy lump of shit over there, right, Patty?  And she got that good pussy that she ain't good at.  Well, but it's accurate.  I guess.  Defend yourself.  Yeah, come on.  Stick up for yourself.  That's not nice.  I'm looking for a job.  How long have you been looking?  I'm not looking hard enough, I guess.  I have to look a little bit harder.  How long have you been looking?  Huh?  How long have you been looking?  I don't know.  Since the summertime.  Sandy Kane could pimp you out.  It should have been since years ago.  You know, she should have been.  I would have been working by now. 
[02:54:00]  I was working here so she could be a cowgirl.  No, the last job you had.  What did you say?  You've got to find a mic with these brilliant lines.  What year?  Maybe you could say it would be a naked cowgirl.  Around four years ago.  Leave that pesky girl part off.  I could soon be a naked cowboy with that face.  Four years ago.  Put a fucking hat on her.  From Sandy.  Put a fucking hat on her, man.  Put a fucking dick in her.  How long were you there when you were there?  Two years ago.  I told the naked cowboy, why don't you put a sock in your underwear? 
[02:54:30]  He said, I already got a sock in there.  Oh, wow.  Put a fucking hat on you, man.  Man.  Put a fucking hat on her.  It was only two hours a day and I had too much time in between.  You couldn't give them more availability.  Too much time on my head.  You couldn't make a cabaret.  Why was it only two hours a day?  You should have told them you were available more hours.  That's a crossing guard job.  How many kids got killed while you were there?  No, there was nobody, nobody.  But you fell asleep once and the kids had to cross the street by themselves because you 
[02:55:00]  fell asleep.  That's why you got fired.  You teach them in their parents' suicide.  Isn't that true?  Isn't that true?  No.  Mike, what do you think of all this?  Mike Pichetti.  Mike Pichetti.  Mike is in a fucking ass.  What kind of job skills do you have?  You have many jobs.  What kind of job skills do you have?  Well, I worked at the Bush for a long time.  How about into the mic?  Make believe it's a natty ice can.  Get your face up against it.  What'd you do?  Drive a truck?  Sampling.  You got to work.  He's setting the fuck up.  Get on the mic. 
[02:55:30]  I never drank on the job.  I remember people who worked for an Heiser Bush years ago, full off the fucking beer truck  years ago in the 80s.  No, no, no, no, no.  I had friends who went to school.  Treat your mic like the roommates didn't get on it.  Did you have sex with him?  I haven't had sex in a while.  I mean, I'm out of practice.  You know what I mean?  Did you masturbate?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Day and night.  Oh, good.  Do you look at pictures when you masturbate?  No, I've got a good memory really.  Fucking therapy session here.  Who do you think about?  Anything that comes up.  I just dweck it about all kinds of whores and stuff. 
[02:56:00]  I really don't care.  You know, I've got a good imagination.  Okay, good.  Oh, boy.  That conjures up an image, doesn't it?  No, I used to work production lines over there.  Oh, okay.  In the brewery.  In the brewery.  Yeah, we know.  Well, that's what I used to do.  If Patty doesn't believe that you can't get that Patty, you've got to...  Yeah, yeah.  How far did you go education-wise?  High school.  Me, too.  Did you graduate high school?  Yes, I did.  All right.  Hey.  High school.  High school.  The train would roll by here. 
[02:56:30]  Why?  Why, Bobo?  It's like a jump in front of that shit.  All right.  Dennis, take us out.  It's obvious we need a break.  We'll be back to finish this mess up next.  Hey, I'll do it.  Yeah, we're going to get this party moving one more time.  Take it back in the old school.  Run DMC and Christmas in Hollis, baby. 
[02:57:00]  One more time.  Get on that dance floor.  It was December 24th when Hollis Evans had dark.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Sirius XM.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve. 
[02:57:30]  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, I believe.  Oh, she's rocking.  She's been drinking too much eggnog.  Oh.  And she left me on the counter.  Drunk mother.  But she forgot her medication.  And she staggered out the door into the snow.  Snow.  When we found her Christmas morning. 
[02:58:00]  Oh.  At the scene of the attack.  Oh.  She had hope prints on her forehead.  Oh.  And my foster father stuck it in my crack.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  Oh.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  Through my tiny eyes, I watched my mother leave. 
[02:58:30]  Now we're all so proud of Grandpa.  He's been taking this so well.  See him in there watching football.  My uncle said he'd kill me if I tell.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer. 
[02:59:00]  Oh.  And we just can't help but wonder.  Should we open up our kids or send them back?  Send them back home.  I want to open them.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Oh.  Nice.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  Aw.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  One more time, everyone.  Oh, there's more.  Now the goose is on the table. 
[02:59:30]  Counter.  Oh, shit.  And the pudding made a fig.  Uh-oh.  That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's place.  I've warned all my friends and neighbors.  Better watch out for yourself.  Oh.  They should never give a license to a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, look out.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Sing it, Grandpa.  Oh.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  She picks it up.  Yeah.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  She looks like she's going to pass out.  I know.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa. 
[03:00:30]  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Merry Christmas.  Oh.  That is.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Continues.  Oh.  We are all in the Christmas spirit.  This party is rocket strong.  So we're going to get that jingle bell going now.  Jingle bells, jingle bells. 
[03:01:00]  Dennis.  Yes, sir.  No.  You didn't make it.  What do you mean I didn't make it?  That was a little forced.  No problem.  You're going to get that jingle bell going?  All right.  I tried.  It was a little forced, though.  It is party time.  We are back here at the Opie and Anthony Show celebrating Christmas 2013.  So, you know what?  If you got a bell, let me hear you jingle it.  Oh.  A little kiss.  Got it.  You kissed it a little bit.  I kissed Barry.  I want to thank Dennis Falcone for playing these amazing songs during the break.  Hey, back, Madeline's got a daughter named Bagel. 
[03:01:30]  Beagle, hey, Bagel.  Sammy.  Lady Di's on the phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She just came back from break saying, hey, I'm on pills right now.  She's on the phone, Barry.  She's on pills?  She just told the person on the phone.  She's on pills.  I don't know.  She's talking about it.  I don't want to get one.  Sammy K goes, what kind of pills?  I want to get one.  I used to do drugs in the 80s.  Now I do them in any temperature.  I would love to fucking do some drugs. 
[03:02:00]  If not, when I came out, I would have had some cocaine.  You still do cocaine?  You still do cocaine?  If you have any.  You really still do cocaine?  I would like some, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  Damn.  That's amazing.  Just a little bump.  Yeah, man.  A little bump to get you through the morning.  I heard you have a flask in our office.  You took a couple swigs.  Yeah, I did.  What do you got in the flask?  Jägermeister.  Nice.  I got Jägermeister because when I was in Germany doing my movie, he just... 
[03:02:30]  German Scheissen form.  It's a fucking hit movie, baby.  She just keeps talking as she's walking around to the microphone.  I have a movie out called Peaches Does Herself.  Oh, cool.  And we filmed it in Berlin, Germany.  So right before it was a play first, Peaches Does Herself at the Hebel Theater in Berlin.  And right before we went on...  You're still trying to figure out which was the biggest atrocity that came out of Berlin. 
[03:03:00]  We went...  You could Google it.  Sandy Kane, Naked Cowgirl in Berlin singing I Love Dick.  Oh, fuck.  I love Peckers.  I love fucking Peckers, man.  Shake those almonds.  I love the Peckers, baby.  But anyways, I love Dick.  Fuck yeah.  So I'm singing I Love Dick for these Germans.  But before we went on stage, we won't take a big swig of Jägermeister.  Oh, that's always good.  So I...  Jägermeister.  That's always good.  Fuck yeah.  Would you like some?  Anyone like some Jägermeister?  Hey, what happened? 
[03:03:30]  Would you like some, Opie?  Oh, my headphones.  Do you drink, baby?  Hey, what happened?  Oh, I drink.  I go fucking...  Hold on, hold on.  What happened with the chair?  Were you two kind of fighting over who was going to get to sit in the chair?  No matter.  It's all right.  What happened?  Oh, nothing.  The headphone just smacked you in the face.  What kind of pills did you get?  What kind of pills?  Thyroid medication.  I was like...  Thyroid medication.  Woman always should first.  I don't care.  All right.  See, here's what happened during the break.  Marion, Lady Di called Marion to see if Marion was actually mad at Lady Di. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  So they're on the phone for a little while, and then Marion said, I want to talk to stalker  Patty.  She gets on the phone with Patty, and then Lady Di limps over the chair, sits down like  an old grandpa.  She goes, ah, and starts talking about how her leg is injured, and then I'm listening  to that conversation, and Patty talking about her surgery and her thyroid and everything  on the phone with Marion.  It was just a disgusting conversation.  It was falling apart.  Like blood loss and all kinds of things.  Yeah, it's a family show. 
[03:04:30]  They took care for that.  It's like a comedy of errors.  I just got a text.  I just got a text from my friend, Lindsay.  She was just saying that Sadie looks like a gremlin.  Yeah, there's a picture of a gremlin there, Sean, on Twitter.  She looks like the female gremlin.  You're going to take that shit?  Is that good?  You're going to take that shit?  I'm going to sue her motherfucking ass.  Of course you will.  Enjoy the court system over and over again until she finally lets up on you.  I'm just saying, is that good, gremlin? 
[03:05:00]  What is a gremlin?  What is a gremlin?  Oh, here she goes.  Gremlin is one of those little creatures.  They made movies out of them.  Oh, really?  It's a toy.  It's a toy.  Holy shit.  Look at her crooked glasses.  Is that good?  Is that an abominable woman?  What?  She's an abominable woman.  Like a flying fucking dome.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know that, dogs.  They made a movie out of gremlins.  They're ugly little bitches. 
[03:05:30]  Okay.  I don't think I look like a gremlin.  You don't think they're ugly, die?  They're ugly.  I don't think so.  It's not Gizmo.  Gizmo is very cute.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  So is that what I look like?  No.  Uh-oh.  Not the Gizmo one.  Not the gremlin.  You look like the ones that ate after midnight.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Hey, I mean, lawsuit.  Okay.  It happened.  Lawsuit.  Man, man.  She knows how the court system works. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, I did, but I didn't show up because I love you guys.  And punitive damages you give me.  Well, maybe you should have told us not to show up.  That would have been nice.  Oh, I could be very litigious.  You have a lot of fans down there, man.  But if you love us, that's why you didn't show up.  Maybe you should have told us not to show up.  It was kind of a real pain in the ass to go down there three times.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But hey, it was my comedy bit.  Well, it worked.  Fair enough.  That's what I'm saying.  All right, you got me back.  Did you always do comedy bits on me?  I said, well, this is my fucking comedy bit.  You know what?  I respect that.  How are you feeling about de Blasio as mayor of New York? 
[03:06:30]  Well, I love Bloomberg.  Yeah.  And de Blasio, it seems like he's going to be all right.  I think he's going to be all right for everybody down there in Times Square.  You think so?  I heard he's going to close and everything.  He likes the car thing and stuff.  I don't know.  I think it's going to go back to the old porn theaters and everything.  Oh, good.  I think you might be able to reprise your role as the dildo fuck show.  The dildo fuck queen.  The dildo fuck show.  I'd love to show my pussy again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't, right?  Yeah, live sex. 
[03:07:00]  That's right.  Right in Times Square.  Yeah, you know.  Book is cool.  Yeah, baby.  I'll get laid again.  Ah, yeah.  See?  Hey, wait.  Can you do a sex show for Mike Buschetti?  Sure.  Because Mike hasn't really had any action lately.  Come on, Mike.  And Boobo, too.  Pee in a cup.  We're allowed to do a sex show as long as, like...  Pee in a cup.  Go ahead.  I had a guy pee in a cup for me.  You should show...  Hey, hey, lady, die.  You should show him your boobs.  Yeah, show your boobs to Bobo, too.  I did that one time already.  Is that a horrible word?  Well, you know if I do a what again, die, die?  You know if I do a what again? 
[03:07:30]  One more time, right?  One more time what?  What are you going to do?  Tell us.  Show him my boobs.  My boobs.  What are you doing for Christmas?  Bobo, you got a jersey.  What can you expect?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at Mike.  Look at Mike.  Well, yeah, baby.  Okay.  She's a skank, right, Mike?  Yeah.  Bobo, take a look.  Bobo, take a look.  You got to show Bobo.  You got to show Bobo.  He loves it.  He loves some boobs.  Bobo looks so sadistic right now, right?  He don't want that pussy.  He don't play.  What do you think, Bobo? 
[03:08:00]  Bobo's looking at that pussy.  It looks like some things don't age well.  It looks like some things don't age well.  It looks like some things don't age well.  You need a Victoria's Secret Hour.  Mike Pichetti liked them, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You suck at this.  Oh, man.  You want to suck a titty.  You got to suck a titty.  Oh, man.  I don't want to tear you.  You suck those fucking tits, Mike.  Which one has the light beer in it?  The left one or the right one?  Suck a titty.  I love you, Jim. 
[03:08:30]  You're the devil's advocate.  Live sex show right here on Opium Answer Show.  No, no.  I don't want to.  Suck those bed bug bite tits.  What do you need for your live sex show?  Huh?  What do you need?  Like a water bottle?  We got a Coke bottle.  What do you need?  I should have brought my red, white, and blue dildo.  Oh, right.  A lady died just grabbed her Coke bottle.  Saying, you ain't using my Coke bottle for no sex show.  A whole fatty arm buckle himself over there.  No, I used to use a Coke bottle at times.  You did?  Yeah.  You don't care what you got to do.  He said, just give me a fucking tip. 
[03:09:00]  That's sexy.  No, the time the guy wanted me to pee in a cup.  And he drank it.  He did, huh?  Oh, fuck.  God damn it.  Jesus Christ.  Still on then like that, man.  Yes, you're next to one.  Five hours a tip.  Yes.  Five hours a tip.  Jim's grandfather.  Back in the day.  Grandpapa.  Before he went off to fucking Europe with the rest of the doughboys.  And he drank it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  He drank it.  No, that was, hey, that's five hours a day.  What year was that?  70s?  70s?  80s?  I can't drink this.  I saw that anymore after here. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, wow.  It was still going on, man.  Jesus, that's crazy.  Drinking urine.  Damn.  Isn't it salty?  Like when you drink that?  You're in New York.  No.  It's like salty, right?  I've never tasted urine.  Oh, okay.  No, but I've never tasted it, but.  Yeah.  I hear it's salty.  Yeah.  He might have tasted it because he sounds it.  Fuck yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Shit.  No, hey, when you eat a pussy, though, and there's urine there, you can taste it.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, hello.  He eats out.  He's a lesbian.  He's a lesbian, man. 
[03:10:00]  You eat out.  You eat out.  You eat out.  Lady Diah.  Lady Diah has something to say.  The same thing when you suck a dick.  Yeah.  You can taste a little bit of urine.  Oh, God.  Okay.  I guess it is salty.  I'm so not sexy.  Oh, you're going to engage you on your phone now.  It's starting to make a lot of sense now.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He always wants to come on the radio show, and then he's on the show, and he's just reading  his text messages.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo, what the fuck's wrong with you?  No, you're not paying attention.  You're not paying attention.  I was hearing you say, I just got, I just got, I just got scored for life. 
[03:10:30]  No, he's just on his phone the whole time.  Not even listening, he doesn't care about the radio show.  No, no.  I was hearing what he was saying.  It's all about him.  Yeah, it's all about him.  I was hearing what was being said.  What was being said?  No, you were telling a story about, about your, about everything you did on your, back  at your dildo fuck show back in the day.  Yes, right.  Oh.  You were saying how someone drank, drank, someone asked to drink the drink of urine, man.  They paid me for it, too.  They paid me 20 bucks for urine. 
[03:11:00]  Pay me, bitch.  All right, man.  You tip me, you drop it, we mop it.  That was the motto.  That was the motto.  You drop it, we mop it.  It was a mop, guys.  They would mop all the cum.  Right.  They would mop the cum.  Yes.  But it was a job.  Bunch of fucking peckers out there.  Lady Di could have that job.  That's a job, at least.  I should take it again.  Right?  Lady Di, you want to mop up cum?  A jack joint.  You could mop up cum. 
[03:11:30]  A jack joint.  You're like the cooler in a porn show.  You would clean up cum in a fucking jack-off place.  You got the tongue for it.  You got the tongue.  She'll take it.  Well, I don't think they would hire her.  They had certain men that would, like, you know.  They had certain standards?  They had certain men that would mop cum.  What do you do for a living?  I mop cum.  What kind of individual mops up cum? 
[03:12:00]  You drop it.  Yeah, what kind of guy was, like, doing that?  You drop it.  We mop it.  They had, like, a microphone up there.  Hi, guys.  Come on in.  What kind of guy did the mopping?  It was just, you know, they weren't white.  Nothing white.  What did they use?  That's all those.  No, they weren't white.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Not that I'm a racist, but none of them were white.  They were more Latin guys or, you know.  Are you talking about peep shows?  Yes.  Peep shows are great.  She is so perceptive.  All right, so you want to mop up cum at peep shows?  How much do they pay? 
[03:12:30]  I don't know.  More than you're making now, which is nothing.  All you can eat.  Exactly.  I don't think they still have that, do they?  Patty.  Hold on, Patty.  Come here.  What's up, Patty?  Patty's not happy about this.  Come here, Patty.  Come on.  The virgin is in the house.  Good job, baby.  Fucking virgin.  It's a good job, right?  It's a good job.  Someone has to do it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You would want a normal job like anyone else.  It's not a normal job.  Patty's a feminist.  I love this.  She's so normal.  What are you doing here without me and Anthony? 
[03:13:00]  They give you a mop, and then you just mop it up.  And then you mop it up.  But it's cum.  I don't have to know that.  Absolutely not.  They probably asked your autograph.  Hey, it's Dippin from Clockwork Orange.  I don't have to do that.  I just mop like I would my own house.  That's it.  I don't have to know.  It doesn't cum all over.  Yeah, she just wouldn't.  It means on your back, you're in on cock.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in on cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It can happen.  It can happen, man.  Yes.  It can happen.  Holy shit.  Just disgusting. 
[03:13:30]  Shit on a cock.  Nah.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  Santa Cain.  He fucked someone else in the ass before.  Okay.  Listen, man.  This is a family show today.  Stop that.  It's a family show.  How'd you get that family?  It's a Christmas show.  Christmas miracle.  No, people always say that.  You know, I'm topless in Times Square.  People say, I got a family.  I said, how'd you get that family?  Not with your top on or your bottom.  Eee.  Right.  Have you had to argue with anyone in Times Square yet?  Always.  Some have their top on and they get a family.  Eee.  Excellent point. 
[03:14:00]  Wow.  Couldn't stop.  Not their underpants on.  Not their underpants on.  What do people say to you that you like this?  No.  Not their underpants.  What do people say?  You're shameless.  That's disgusting.  And what do you say?  And I say, my child is here.  So I go, how'd you get that child?  Do you have a curse at them back?  Oh, fuck.  Ha.  You do?  And I do say the N word.  Wow.  No, because let's face it.  There is prejudice in the world.  When blacks see you white bitch making money, they don't like it.  So what do they say to you? 
[03:14:30]  If I was black, they'd be bitch.  I hate that shit, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Give me an example.  What happens?  No, I just say, hey.  What do they say to you?  Yes, they don't say it.  You know, they just say, hey, bitch.  They circle you.  You know, a lot of times, like a lot of black kids, they circle you.  Right.  And they go, bitch, why are you doing, why are you naked?  Yeah.  Why are you naked?  And then what do you say?  I say, uh, you know, and then, you know, I look around and then I do say sometimes the N word.  Nigger.  That's a real shit.  Nigger's, get the fuck out of here. 
[03:15:00]  And then they go to the cops.  And then they go to the cops and then she did a racial slur.  They go to the cops?  Yeah, they go to the cops.  They go to the cops.  But she did a racial.  They did call you a white bitch initially.  Yeah, they totally did.  White bitch.  What the fuck?  Why are you naked?  And what did you say?  I'm naked because I'm naked money, bitch.  You know?  Yeah, and just don't surround me, man.  Don't surround me.  Yeah, they'll play the knockout game.  Yeah, yeah, it's like, it's very scary.  They don't touch you that way. 
[03:15:30]  She's like a grandma Tupac or something.  I've been touched.  I've been touched.  You know?  Hey, can I touch him?  She?  No, no, shit.  I heard about the knockout game.  The eyes on those cops have been scarred so much they won't answer the call anymore.  Oh, my God.  I do hear.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  What are you saying, lady?  There's nothing funny about that.  I said I heard about the knockout game.  I don't see anything funny about that.  I agree.  Oh, man.  Good point.  Good point.  She plays it with a bottle every night.  I just do feel if I was a black cowgirl, they wouldn't be saying this shit.  Oh, they might. 
[03:16:00]  They'd be like, damn, I'm a little fine and shit.  You're fine, bitch.  I've got nice titties.  Yeah.  No, but show us your pussy, bitch.  Oh, fuck.  What do you say?  It was more like, hey, why are you naked?  And then what do you say?  Hey, make money.  You see this money?  Yeah.  But, you know, blacks hate whites to make green.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Saturdays.  Oh, no, but I'm not, though, because I think they're, you know, but I'm just saying, this  is what happens in Times Square.  Sandy, Sandy.  It happens in Times Square.  When you make money, where do you put it? 
[03:16:30]  I put it in my hole.  Where?  My hole.  I have a hole in my guitar.  Oh, wow.  But I have been robbed.  No, but before I did that, I was robbed a few times.  How did that hole get there in your guitar?  How did they rob you?  They robbed me.  They just fucking robbed me, man.  On Times Square?  Three times I was naked in Times Square with everything stolen, no clothes.  How did they take your, what do you mean?  They stopped.  Well, I had my purse years ago.  Damn.  So now I have a hole in my guitar, thanks to the naked cowboy.  Did you see him, though? 
[03:17:00]  Did you see him?  They got to rob you?  Well, I was standing there, man, and this guy, the tourist saw him.  They said, yeah, he took your bag and put it in a black garbage bag and ran away.  Did you get a description?  He was black.  But of course.  But of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was black.  And they put it in a black garbage bag and ran away with it.  Yeah.  And, you know, the cops, forget it, the cops don't care.  They didn't help you?  Fuck.  No.  No.  Cops, could you do some Janis Joplin?  I think I was naked with a guitar. 
[03:17:30]  Could you do Joplin, Janis Joplin?  We love her.  I said, come on.  I just was fucking wrong, man.  Oh, man.  What are they doing?  Do you stand naked in this weather?  No.  Not usually.  It's 50 degrees today.  But now you've got it.  You take the winner off?  Yes, unfortunately.  It's 50 degrees today.  Yeah, it's very nice today.  It's nice out today.  What do you mean it's nice out?  50 degrees.  What does this have to do?  Hey, ready for love.  The weather blob has spoken.  50 degrees.  I'm just a black.  That's great. 
[03:18:00]  But it's amazing.  She's not really racist because she had black dick from,  the Southland Show Show.  Yeah, I love black dick.  Le Mans from Sam Branson.  He was a celebrity, though.  Yeah.  I got to be honest.  No, but hey.  And he did come in here.  I like celebrity dick.  You said he came in you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he shot a load in you?  Definitely.  Speaking of celebrities, where's Paul McCartney?  Where is he?  I thought he was supposed to be here today.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Yeah, me neither. 
[03:18:30]  I'd like to find out.  I'd like to meet him.  Did he fuck for this music?  That would have been hilarious.  I like O.B. and Anthony myself.  I'd rather meet them.  Thank you, Santa Candy.  I do.  I really mean that.  You know what he's...  You fuck that monster, Le Mans?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You come in early, y'all.  Hell yeah.  You came in me, baby.  I should have saved the comment.  She looked like a negative of Honesta.  I'm not sure you heard about this, too, kid,  but Sandy here allegedly got raped by Richard Pryor.  I did.  That's right.  I think I'm a black dick.  You didn't have a big dick, Pryor? 
[03:19:00]  Very big.  Hold on.  We got Paul McCartney in the line.  No.  Yes, we do.  Oh, okay.  Hold on a minute.  This would be a great way to end this.  Sir Paul.  Happy holidays, my friend.  Holy shit.  Sir Paul McCartney.  What's up, Sir Paul?  What's that nigga?  Oh, my God.  I'm looking forward to meeting y'all later  and having a good time.  You know what you're lad.  You seem like a lot of fun.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di, grab the mic.  Lady Di's in studio.  She got all dressed up nice to meet you today.  Hi, Paul.  How you doing, Paul?  Lady Di, how are you? 
[03:19:30]  Nice to meet you.  Very good.  Sing something.  Oh.  What do you want me to sing?  Anything.  Anything.  All my loving.  Please sing it.  All my loving.  All my loving.  All my loving.  I will give to you.  Wow.  That's the fucking, that's the Paul McCartney we all know.  That's that nigga right there.  All my loving.  I love you, Paul.  I love you, Paul.  I mean, Paul's my favorite.  I always loved the Beatles.  And I always, and Paul, you're always my favorite.  You're my favorite.  Wait, let Lady Di talk to Paul McCartney.  Actually, actually, Paul Ringo was my favorite.  But it's like, no, really. 
[03:20:00]  I like them all.  Why would you say that to Paul McCartney?  Really?  What are you saying?  He was at least.  Ringo was no one's favorite.  It doesn't sound like Paul McCartney.  Lady Di, I mean, you know, you say you're a big fan of mine, and you're talking about Ringo.  So, like, he better put something like that.  He doesn't set up.  I like all of you guys.  Oh, Ringo was hilarious, though.  Lady Di's playing with her hair.  She's twirling her hair.  I always twirl my hair.  You know that.  Like a fucking flustered little girl.  Is this really Paul McCartney? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, it really is.  Are you kidding me?  He's in the building.  He's in the building.  Come up and visit us.  Yes.  He should.  Can I get a hug from you?  Huh?  Look, Lady Di, can I get a hug from you?  Sure you can.  That'd be nice.  You come up here, you'll get a hug, all right?  Oh, boy.  I probably won't let you go.  I'm the fucking man before, you fucking animal.  I knew it wasn't him.  I knew it wasn't him.  Oh, now you know.  Oh, now you know.  Now you know.  Now you know.  Now you know.  She's ready to suck that dick.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Bunch of beetle peckers.  Good impression, though, but I knew it was not Paul McCartney.  All right.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Bob Webby again, huh?  We should wrap this shit up.  Yeah.  What a great holiday extravaganza.  I pulled the pictures of you, Bob.  Okay?  On the internet?  Yeah.  You're a good looking guy.  Way to fight back. 
[03:21:30]  He's gone.  He's gone.  He is.  That bit spread if it's in small doses, so.  He's got garbage.  All right.  I think we're done, man.  What a great time that was.  I don't know what the fuck we did, but.  Oh, I'm not quite done.  Yes.  Neither am I.  Oh, my loving.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Tonight, tomorrow, Mount Kisco, New York.  I'll be at the Comedy Den at the Holiday Inn.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  December 27, 29, Vegas with the Hard Rock. 
[03:22:00]  Wow.  And then San Diego for New Year's Eve at the American Comedy Company.  Oh.  North Carolina, Georgia, D.C. and Atlantic City.  Go to my website, jimnorton.com.  Wow.  And all ticket links.  That's sick.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's right there.  Fucking great.  Chip photobombed you.  In every picture.  Yeah.  No.  All right.  Almond shake.  Dennis Falcone, thanks.  Oh, yeah, Dennis.  Did a great job today.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  Thanks for coming down today.  One more time.  Can we try to get somebody on the dance floor? 
[03:22:30]  Merry Christmas.  Happy New Year, everybody.  Diane, what about Mike?  Wait, Dennis.  Yeah.  Go around the room and thank everybody that was here.  That would be the easiest way to do this.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  We've got to thank Houdat over there who came down today.  Houdat.  The new kid here.  Right.  We've got Lady Di who came down today.  We have the Naked Cowgirl.  We have Bobo who's here.  Mike Machete is here, right?  Stalker Patty in there in the corner.  All right.  And, of course, I've got to thank Mars who helped me out today.  Sent me a big time. 
[03:23:00]  Thank you, Mars.  Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Sally Boy.  Sal.  All right.  And, of course, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yes.  And to you, the listener.  Merry Christmas.  Have a Happy New Year.  See you guys next year.  Merry Christmas.  I'm telling you why.  Santa Claus is coming to town.  Santa Claus is coming to town.  Santa Claus is coming to town. 
[03:23:30]  He's making a list.  He's checking it twice.  He's going to find out who's blowing ice.  Say that Claus is coming to town.  Say that Claus is coming to town.  Say that Claus is coming to town.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over. 
[03:24:00]  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After O.N.A. Live is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Jesus Christ.  This is why Who Kid is afraid of white people.  Because of situations like this. 
[03:24:30]  Most of us are still here.  He wasn't scarred.  Sandy Cain's out there?  What's Sandy Cain doing out there?  Sandy Cain's out in the hallway.  Bobo's trying to talk jive to DJ Who Kid.  Everybody in his room has been scarred by Twaddle.  Oh, man.  The lady dies here.  I didn't see it.  Mars is trying to clean up.  It looks like a mushroom.  I don't know.  Oh, Mike Machete's still back there.  I see you, Mike.  One in here.  Should I take that?  Mike. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, sure.  Sure, sure.  Obie's still here.  Oh, he's writing checks.  Is Who Kid on the list?  No, I didn't make it.  I don't know.  You didn't make my list.  You didn't make my list.  What's great about Who Kid is if he's not on your list, he'll just rob you.  So it's no problem.  Get that money.  Man, what a show today.  Fucking Sal gets a full share this year.  That's bullshit.  There's no way he's done a full.  Like, I understand him getting a full share, but I feel like, number one, there's less employees 
[03:25:30]  than there used to be.  There's no doubt about that.  We've trimmed the fat in a major way.  Hey.  And number two, yes, Sal can get a full share, but maybe those of us that have been here  a little longer, maybe up our share and maybe realize that those who decided to take the  week before the week off, off, maybe they don't get a full share.  Makes sense.  Maybe they don't get that full deep check.  You know what I'm saying, Lady Di?  Yeah, I don't know anything about checks lately.  I write out checks.  You know why you don't know anything about checks?  Yeah, because I haven't been working. 
[03:26:00]  Well, you're very lazy.  You want to pay checks?  Very lazy.  Can you turn Lady Di on?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know, it's a weird question.  That's why, though.  I mean, don't you think, like, maybe you did a little work, stop being such a lush, you  would have some checks to cash?  Say that one more time.  No, I don't even worry about it.  You know what I'm saying, DJ.  Who kid, right?  Bobo, you get what I'm getting at, right?  What was your favorite moment today, who kid?  Seeing a leathery Dorito chip.  You're talking about Sandy Cain's Twatto? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Sandy Cain in the fucking house, right?  All right.  How's it going?  It did look like a leathery Dorito.  It did.  That's what Twatto looked like, a leathery Dorito.  That's the best description ever.  I mean, we've heard it described in many ways, but I think that could be the number one ever.  Oh, shock.  I remember sitting at home as a listener when Twatto was unveiled, and I was sitting there  like, I don't get it.  I remember that.  Di, you were there.  Shut up.  I'm talking about my experiences.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't always have to be about you.  I mean, that's the lesson of the day. 
[03:27:00]  What's that?  Sometimes you can shut up.  It doesn't always have to be about you.  Okay.  You know?  I'll shut up.  Thank you.  I mean, I don't blame her.  Lady Di is gorgeous?  Thank you.  You might want to get your eyes checked.  Yeah.  Is the cataract sitting in?  You might want to get Twatto checked and your eyes.  Yeah.  Boobs.  The genital warts are moving up to your pupils.  Genital warts.  She does have boobs.  So I heard.  She has the boobs.  Did you know coming in today, Lady Di, that you exposed yourself three, four times?  Yeah, I kind of figured that.  You knew that.  How the fuck would you know that coming in? 
[03:27:30]  There's no way that you knew that coming in.  Nah.  That was a lie you just told me.  It's not the first time I showed my boobs.  No?  When was the first time?  Oh, but you know that, right?  What?  What?  What do I know?  It's not the first time I showed my boobs.  What do I know, Lady Di?  It's not the first time that I showed my boobs.  Are you trying to get me into your alcoholism?  What now?  Well, she did say that she's drinking alcohol for her throat, so I'll give her that back.  You're finally admitting you were drinking alcohol?  Yeah.  No. 
[03:28:00]  No.  No, it's not really.  Seriously.  Dude, she's been nursing that same bottle of Coke all morning.  I wanted to drink it up because I don't like to take the Coca-Cola to the bathroom.  Yeah, but you've been nursing it.  You're not taking big gulps.  And when you go out of the studio, you take it with you, and you won't accept another Coke.  I'll get you a cold one.  Fresh.  Fizzy.  That's fine.  You don't have to.  You know why you don't want it?  What?  Because I'm not going to pour vodka in mine that I'm going to give you.  Okay.  You got vodka in that water bottle?  No.  A little rum?  What do you have in the Coke bottle? 
[03:28:30]  Just tell us what you have in the Coke bottle.  No, it's obvious her friend...  Oh, shut up, Bobo.  We're not doing that bit anymore.  Yeah, Bobo.  Bobo, I think Bobo had his time.  Holy fuck.  That's it.  What?  All I had was Coke.  And bad breath, then.  Yeah.  Because it smelled like something.  I don't know.  I guess.  I don't know.  Is Denny done partying for the day?  Yeah, I guess so.  Disconnect him, then.  Disconnect him.  What do you think?  Can we play my Dick song?  Yeah, give me this.  What do you need?  Hurricane Sandy.  We'll play the Hurricane Sandy.  Let's play Hurricane Sandy. 
[03:29:00]  I don't know.  Because now I see your eyes.  Right.  It's a brand new song.  We're on the after show now.  Right.  And that means if you break this CD, I'm going to get dragged into a lawsuit.  I learned my lesson.  I don't feel like going out of the court system anytime soon.  I learned my lesson.  Trust me.  Who would have thought that Sandy came and be back?  She got me back.  What a Christmas miracle that Sandy came and returned to the show.  I never thought you'd be back, Sandy.  I never did either.  Well, that's because you sued Opie and Anthony three times.  Why the fuck would you do that?  Well, it was one time, but she made us show up three different times. 
[03:29:30]  What was the thinking behind that?  Opie and Anthony have given you a large part of your livelihood, a lot of the fame.  No, not really.  You don't think they gave you a lot of fame?  No.  I never got a job from the Opie and Anthony.  He's talking to that much.  Yeah, but we pumped up your profile.  No, that's...  I would call comedy clubs and they hang up on me.  I'm Sandy came from the Opie and Anthony show, click.  Hey, Sandy.  I'm sorry.  When you got into your shit with Naked Cowboy, who's the show that backed you?  Them.  Opie and Anthony.  That was a big one.  That was a big one.  Who got you on the air and got a lawyer defending you and took a massive shit on the Naked Cowboy? 
[03:30:00]  Remember that lawyer that was calling people character?  Yes.  He was on your side.  I know.  And what do you do to pay back the favor?  Right.  You take him to court.  Right.  In what mind would you think that was an appropriate thing to do?  You went to court.  Dude, I showed up three times.  Get the fuck out of here.  She didn't show up.  No.  And because she didn't show up.  I did the first time.  Hold on.  Because she didn't show up, they kept postponing it.  We're like, could you just drop this stupid, silly thing?  And they go, no.  So once a month or once every three weeks, we had to go back down.  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[03:30:30]  And after the third time, they finally said, all right, fuck.  We'll dismiss this thing.  She's not showing up.  She's a maniac.  It's a real pain in the ass to get down there.  I knew it would be my comedy bit, though.  That's not funny, though.  No.  Why would you do that?  Well, because they did comedy bits on me, so this was my comedy bit.  You said, I get you back.  Yes.  I don't have a show, but what I do have is some forms.  I can take you to small claims court.  I have a bus ticket to City Hall.  Well, I went to the police.  I did.  You went to the police.  Hey, they traumatized me.  That traumatized me.  Are we on better terms now, though? 
[03:31:00]  Oh, definitely.  Because Opie said, we left someone out.  They said, this one's going to be on that way.  He said, but we let someone out.  And that was God saying, bitch, get up there.  It was funny, the comment.  I'm aware I wasn't talking about her.  She really thinks I'm talking about her.  But you made the comment that there's not a sight out of mind for me.  You don't remember?  You don't remember?  I remember saying that.  There are people.  I was thinking about Big A, actually.  To be totally honest with you.  No, I'm just saying that the minute I tuned it in, it said that that was Jesus.  That was a sign. 
[03:31:30]  And that was the police spirit.  Does Jesus appreciate the dildo sex show?  Or is it the dildo fuck show?  Dildo fuck show.  Does Jesus appreciate a good dildo fuck show now that you found Jesus?  You have to do what you've got to do, Opie.  I mean, I bet you don't sometimes want to come in, and you come in here because it's  your job, and you do it.  I love coming in here.  It's amazing.  That's clear to everybody.  Thank you.  On a day-to-day basis.  Especially lately, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, thank you.  Well, that's a great thing.  I got a new attitude.  To love your job.  Right.  Me as a naked cowboy, I love that, too. 
[03:32:00]  It is funny that you mention that there's something about this show that there are people  associated with it that are convinced that when you're talking on the radio, it's a direct  conversation with them.  Oh, it's scary.  Yeah.  Trust me, it's scary.  I would imagine.  But maybe it really was Jesus.  Jesus has been anywhere near this show for a long time, Sandy.  It's too bad Jesus wasn't talking to Lady Di when she had that fucking car accident.  Yeah, Jesus would have taken the wheel that day, didn't he?  When you don't know what God is, when certain things happen, that's what it is.  And I'm here because he worked his magic. 
[03:32:30]  Is that how you set your tits on fire?  Because, you know, he did work his magic because you probably should have died of AIDS  20 years ago.  Do you miss us?  I'm amazed you're still alive.  Holy fuck.  That's Jesus.  I should have died from AIDS, but Jesus.  No, I don't want you to die from AIDS.  Me neither.  Don't fucking confuse it, but I'm amazed you didn't.  Well, you can't get AIDS from a dildo.  But I'm amazed you didn't.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't want you to die from AIDS.  I bet you could get a little AIDS leftovers on a dildo.  You can?  I bet you could.  You can't believe that shit.  Get out of here.  I bet you could.  So, Sam, I want to make one video with these guys. 
[03:33:00]  I want to ask them one fucking question.  The same question.  With Bobo and Mike and Lady Di.  It's Bobo, Mike, Lady Di, Sandy Kane.  Is that all we got left?  Yeah, Stalker Patty took a hike.  She had to catch a bus.  She actually has work to do, Lady Di.  We got four, though.  That's good.  What's one question I could ask these guys?  Well, I think people would be curious to find out what's the best thing that happened to him this year.  That's what I think.  I think that's the question.  You think that's the question?  Why is my soul ringing?  That's a terrible question, Lady Di. 
[03:33:30]  The video would be over in no time.  I'm talking to myself.  That's a horrible idea.  Okay.  What's he doing?  I think it's an amazing idea.  Lady Di, where do we set this up?  I don't do logos anymore.  Fuck the logos.  What?  Fuck logos.  It's your logo.  I know.  I don't like it.  Don't like it at all.  It sends your name on it.  Yeah, fuck logos.  Who Kid, have you ever seen anything like this before?  I've never heard of this before.  Hip-hop loves logos.  Fuck logos.  I'm putting that shit on my shit.  Hip-hop, who kid doesn't wear any clothes unless they're paying him to wear them. 
[03:34:00]  Fuck that shit, right.  Fuck logos.  Where else can I film this shit?  Is his name who kid or who dat?  It's who dat.  It's who dat.  I don't know why he's saying who kid.  Well, permanent.  I messed up all the time, Lady Di.  That's who dat.  Sometimes I do, too.  That's why I was asking.  That's hard to believe.  Yeah.  So, the best thing that ever happened to us this year?  Yes.  Don't answer.  Or how about we go ever?  Ever.  Ever.  Let's go forever.  That's some Jesus attorney shit.  What is your life's greatest achievement?  Damn. 
[03:34:30]  That's huge.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  Bobo, you thinking?  You got...  Your life's greatest achievement.  That's pretty good.  And we could shut the curtain over here and do it in the studio still, but in front of a  curtain, there's no logo.  Yeah, fuck logos.  That's right.  Even if it's your own.  Right.  What?  It makes no sense.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  Does everyone have an answer yet?  Are we thinking?  My life's greatest achievement.  Do you have one?  Maybe we can include Denny in this, too.  I know mine is... 
[03:35:00]  I mean, I know he's not quite full on.  Bobo, you got one?  Yeah, I got one.  All right, don't say it.  You got one, Lady Di?  Yeah, I do.  Bichetti, you back there with one?  Yeah, yeah.  You got an accomplishment?  But you guys, you gotta explain it, though.  You can't just say, like, you know, whatever.  You gotta answer in, like, a full sentence, like, documentary style.  Well, my life's greatest accomplishment is, and then tell the story.  And then explain why.  Should I give him an example?  Yeah.  Yes, fuck who, kid.  Or who dat, or whatever the fuck.  Who dat, what's your greatest accomplishment in your life? 
[03:35:30]  Well, I met Nelson Mandela, hung out with him in South Africa.  That's huge.  And I'm a nigga.  Okay, well, that's two things that you can really chalk up to having a fulfilled life.  Fuck yeah.  Plus, I was going to think that your number one accomplishment would be that you fuck bitches.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's normal, ain't it?  Not for me.  Not for me, who kid.  It's normal, as long as I don't have a twaddle.  I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?  Would you have sex with Sandy Kane?  Yeah, I would.  You would? 
[03:36:00]  Let's go.  Come on.  Fuck this shit.  He goes, fuck this shit.  Let's go.  Sandy Kane's about to have a new all-time life accomplishment.  He's a very cute.  I mean, she's going, he's going.  Very handsome guy.  All right, where are we going to do this shit?  He is a handsome guy.  He is.  No longer.  I like his personality, too.  We can do it right in front of there.  Good.  Okay.  Shut the curtain.  Shut the curtain.  Okay.  All right, let's get an intern to shut the curtain.  In the meantime, I'm going to talk to you about a guy, while we set this up, I'm going  to talk to you about a guy's winter dilemma.  Yeah.  You know about this.  She wants to bundle up, and you want to see some skin.

Well, everybody heard you sing I Love Dick on the Taylor show this morning. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  We got that one out there already.  What was your favorite part of the show today, Opie?  Do you need time to process it before you can pick a favorite?  Yeah, I really do.  Actually, the interviews with Taylor were amazing.  She did a good job.  Yeah.  What about the phone calls with Marion?  No.  No.  Those were obviously the least favorite.  Not so much.  Yeah.  Terrible.  The least favorite.  No, that's...  Yeah, it wasn't that great.  Really?  You can die to face reality.  I probably enjoyed Taylor finding out that Lady Dye's baby daddy jumped in front of a train 
[03:39:00]  while she was trying to do a fun Christmas show.  That was a great story.  That was a great moment, though.  In the context.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  In the context of everything.  But it's not funny.  But it was a great moment.  We got to admit it was a great moment.  It's black comedy, right?  Yeah.  It was a great moment, and it made for good radio.  Right.  Yeah, good radio, baby.  It was good radio.  When it happened, it was fantastic.  Exactly.  That's what I was getting at.  He lost his dad.  Oh, baby, I see.  I don't know what's funny about that. 
[03:39:30]  So should we play Sandy's song now?  Yeah, well, it's your show.  Hurricane Sandy, she's in the house.  What is this?  This is your Sandy relief song.  Hurricane Sandy relief song.  Yeah, all the proceeds go to the Hurricane Sandy relief fund.  Yeah, but what if it doesn't make any money?  What do you mean all proceeds?  They don't accept change?  Yeah, they won't.  But I said the last winter recording it twice in Nashville.  They don't accept empties?  Sandy.  No, I mean, I always write songs about other people.  I have an O.P. and Anthony song.  Wow, I'm going to see you for that. 
[03:40:00]  So you're going to tell me that I love Dick song is on this Hurricane Sandy show?  It's on the Hurricane Sandy.  All right.  Is it on iTunes?  Not yet.  Oh, physical CDs.  Perfect for 2014.  Well, a lot of the other stuff.  Dick is on iTunes, but this is a brand new thing.  It just came out.  All right, we'll get up on iTunes.  We'll get up on iTunes.  This is a premiere on the O.P. and Anthony show.  No one has ever heard it.  You want to hear this?  It's for the hard drive of hits?  It is.  All right, all right.  Why don't I play this for you, Sandy Kane?  It's cool.  Yeah, let's do it.  Welcome back to the show.  Please don't sue me. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  It's country.  I recorded in Nashville.  Sandy, we got it.  Here's your Hurricane Sandy relief song.  Country.  I'm a bird.  I'm a plane.  I'm a hurricane.  I'm a bird.  I'm a plane.  I'm a...  Don't mess with me, Sandy Kane.  I'm a freaking hurricane.  I will mess with the grind.  I will drive you insane.  It's a night to wind.  It's a night to rain.  I am a hurricane. 
[03:41:00]  Hurricane Sandy Kane.  Hurricane Sandy.  That's perfect.  Really well done.  Really well done.  Really well done.  That was great.  I like the first verse.  Yeah.  I would say the vocals are a little low in the mix.  The first hook.  That was like an iTunes sample for everybody.  And if they like it...  I'll buy it if they want it.  Yeah.  You don't want to get the...  They're going to record it off their radio.  You don't want to get the whole thing away.  They're going to record it off their radio.  I want to hear at least one verse.  No.  Because you don't want to...  I am a hurricane. 
[03:41:30]  Hurricane Sandy Kane.  Hurricane Sandy.  She is in the room.  Sandy likes the music that goes boom, boom.  Hurricane Sandy is in the studio.  She likes the wizard.  She likes to blow.  Don't mess with me.  Let the record show that Lady Di just went to Sandy Kane and said, I really like this  song.  But she doesn't have headphones on.  She doesn't have headphones on, so she can't even hear the fucking thing.  The monitors aren't playing.  She didn't hear it. 
[03:42:00]  But she's telling Sandy Kane that she likes it.  Yes, I did.  Sandy, she's got to hear the Sandy Kane.  I'm freaking her rookie.  I'll take gas and fly away.  It's hard.  I will drive you insane.  Cause I'm like a wind.  I'm like cocaine.  I am a hurricane.  That's beautiful.  Beautiful.  Sandy, well done.  Sandy has the greatest tits.  She's a superstar.  Okay, that's a lie.  She's a super bitch.  Nice.  See?  Lookit, you're a rap expert. 
[03:42:30]  She's a superstar.  We got it.  We got it.  Super star.  You're a rap expert.  Where is that?  Where is that?  On all-time lists.  Tupac.  Like, she's smashing Will Smith.  Will Smith is fucking out of here.  He is.  Fuck Will Smith.  He's great.  That whole record is like, fuck Will Smith.  Period.  What do you think about Will Smith?  He's lucky.  What about?  Lucky nigger.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's out of line.  That's out of line.  She's real.  She's real.  She's a real dude.  To me, it's out of line.  You don't think Will Smith is a little lucky, don't you? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, he's lucky, kid.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Yeah, you know, you could take anyone and walk the street and do as good a job as him.  Wow.  That's how I feel.  Jesus.  Bitches.  You think we can get our situation?  I liked Will Smith in Men in Black 2.  What about Men in Black 3?  That one, too?  No, I never saw that one.  Oh, thanks for your fucking life story about Will Smith.  Really appreciate it.  And he's married to Jada Pinkett.  Oh, she's a bitch.  I've got a queue in Wikipedia here.  Jada Pinkett is a bitch. 
[03:43:30]  I met her.  The worst.  Oh, for real?  Another lucky woman.  Oh, wow.  Don't you think that she's lucky?  I'm surprised she didn't want to talk to you.  Yeah.  What'd she ever do?  She wasn't nice to you?  Jada Pinkett?  You're usually so charming.  Real twat.  Real twat.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  No, I'm just saying.  She wasn't nice.  She wasn't nice.  You want to try this video?  She's pretty, though.  You want to try to do this video?  Sure.  Why don't we do this?  So we're going to go one at a time with these people?  Yeah, we could do that.  And we'll mic them.  We need a light on the set.  Okay, so where are they going to do this? 
[03:44:00]  Do what?  You know what we could do?  On the couch?  We could even have them on that mic.  What?  And you get the door in the background.  No logo.  No logo.  No logo on the floor.  Nice.  So we could each...  Look, Sandy, I don't want you suing anybody.  We could have them each take turns being in that middle spot.  I need a Quaalude, please.  I'll bet you do.  Yeah, for what?  Fucking Quaalude.  For Opin's video.  Your greatest accomplishment.  Don't say what it is, Di.  I'm not going to say what it is.  Very good.  By the way, you look beautiful today.  Thank you very much.  Mars, we need a set. 
[03:44:30]  No, look at the glare.  There's a glare there.  A little glare.  What do you think about just putting them in that middle seat there?  Middle seat of the console?  No, middle seat of the console.  There you go.  That's a keeper.  What do you mean, I'm the console?  Like sitting right there where Sandy is.  What?  You don't like that.  How about they sit on that fucking couch?  Denny, get your bullshit out of the way.  Whatever you got.  Denny brought the whole equipment up here.  Denny killed it today.  Yeah, Denny did kill it.  One of the greatest moments of today's show.  That's where you've got to listen to the whole replay and get it on demand.  Fuck that. 
[03:45:00]  We're going to put it on a podcast, Sam Roberts.  We are.  But the way the show started.  Can you go a little bit less than that?  Because I want to buy two of them.  With Denny.  Would you shut the fuck up?  I'm trying to broadcast.  She's buying fucking Sandy Cain CDs.  You're paying for it.  Sandy.  Pound it out.  Why two?  Bitch.  Pound it out.  The bitch.  That's a business, baby.  That's business.  One for Marion.  Oh, you've got to buy one for Marion.  Yes.  I thought she didn't have a job.  What other jobless alcoholic would be sitting here buying Sandy Cain CDs?  I guess if she wasn't an alcoholic, she wouldn't be spending it. 
[03:45:30]  It's fucking real.  I'm going to give you two.  So I have one in there.  All right.  Oh, she just got hustled.  She buys $10 a CD.  How much money is this fucking money?  No, no, no.  I love it.  Sandy, I'm on your side.  I could only give her some money.  Wait, what happened?  It's $10 a CD.  Yeah.  Lady Di says, I love the song, I want to buy a CD.  Yeah.  She gives Sandy a $20 bill, and Sandy goes, no, I'm going to give you two.  I have another one.  So instead of getting change and just buying one, that's two.  Pound it out, Sandy.  Get that money.  Make that money.  She knows how to fucking hustle, bro. 
[03:46:00]  Get that paper.  It is real out here.  She fucking hustles.  I like it.  Get that paper.  Get that paper.  Get that shit.  Look at you with the legs spread.  Well, let's watch it put the money in the hole now.  She says she puts money in the hole.  Nice.  Yeah, I don't need to see your pussy.  It's a rough one.  I got to be honest with you.  Sandy, can I tell you something?  Thank you, Sandy.  I would hit that.  I need money.  I would hit that.  Hit what?  You.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You hit that with an uppercut.  There you go.  Look.  With a size 10. 
[03:46:30]  Look where she's putting the money.  Pasty.  Right on the pasty.  All right.  So where are we going to shoot?  Right there in the fucking corner.  Right there in the corner.  All right.  Get me some light there, Mars.  Does that one work?  Let there be light.  Let there be light indeed.  Let there be.  Whoa.  Very nice.  Yeah.  That's a porn light.  It is.  That is.  That's a casting couch, isn't it?  What's the question again?  The question is, what is your life's greatest accomplishment? 
[03:47:00]  Are we miking them?  Yeah, Mars.  Can you hook them up with a mic?  Yes.  And then we'll actually, Opie, be able to give you the feed of this.  So you're experiencing the audio live now as it happens.  And later today, you get to experience the visual element.  And we'll cut out all that microphone fucker you're hearing right now.  That's not great.  Mike Buschetti, this is not a professional show.  You know that by now.  You know that by now.  Should we start, who are we going to start with, Mike?  Why don't we give him the nice, cushy chair?  Okay.  Okay.  Let's go. 
[03:47:30]  Up, up, up, up.  Up, up, up.  Mike.  Oh, boy.  No, we need that.  By the way, just a little taste while we're setting this up.  Big things planned on this channel for January 6th when we return.  Big things.  Sandy.  What?  You listen to the Opie and Anthony show every day?  Every morning.  Wait till you tune in on the 6th of January when we're back.  Relaunching the entire channel.  Get the fuck out of here, bro.  Okay?  Yeah.  Big thing.  It means big things are popping.  It means it's going to sound different. 
[03:48:00]  It means there's going to be some programming changes happening.  Mars might have a heart attack.  He's breathing really heavy over here.  Oh, boy.  Mars is not used to him.  You actually asked him to do some work today.  Well, he's not used to manual labor.  He's out of shape.  Do you know, I gave up my TV and I only listen to Sirius, whether it's the Opie and Anthony  show, or I like the old-time radio.  I gave up my TV.  Well, you remember when it was on live, the old-time radio.  Well, not that old.  You get it, Mike.  I got that right away.  But they were in the 60s.  20s on 20?  Dude, she's got her nails cut in such a way that they're weapons. 
[03:48:30]  Did anyone else notice that?  Let me see.  Is it sharp?  Yeah.  You sharpen those shits.  No.  They just like that.  You're street smart.  Look at your thumbnail.  Yes.  That's friggin' jagged.  Those are claws.  Green and red for Christmas.  Opie's always looking.  He knows Sandy can't be trusted.  I'm going to take short nails with the Blasio as mayor.  But this is when I finger-fuck myself.  It's good.  It's your inch.  All right.  Quiet on the set.  That means you, Lady Di.  Yes.  And we'll start with Mike Bocchetti as we film Opie's next... 
[03:49:00]  Hold the mic.  I want the mic to make a fucking video.  Okay.  We film Opie's next viral sensation.  I don't want the fucking video.  Okay.  It could look all right if he's talking into the microphone.  No, it wouldn't look all right.  It'll look professional.  I don't want the radio bit.  Fuck radio.  Okay.  That's where you've made your living.  Yeah, I will.  I'm just going to fuck radio.  I love radio.  What's the question again?  Some of us are still trying.  The question is...  Your greatest life.  Your life's greatest accomplishment.  Mars is holding the microphone like a boom mic in case there's any... 
[03:49:30]  Mars, I don't...  It's in my shot.  It's not in the shot.  We've got to hear him.  You'll hear enough.  This isn't just video time with Opie radio.  Are we ready?  Radio.  We've got to get this done in 10 minutes, by the way.  Fuck you.  No, fuck you.  I'm kidding.  Go on, Mike.  My greatest life's achievement has been able to make...  Hold on.  Start over.  Okay.  Take two.  My greatest life's achievement...  Now, look at the camera.  My greatest life's achievement has been for the past year or so, I've been able to make  people laugh on the Artie Lang Show. 
[03:50:00]  You guys bring me here at Open Anthony.  I'm just happy to be doing stuff on a national level and super blessed.  And who's the hottest chick you ever banged?  I'm still waiting on that one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I got champagne and caviar taste when it comes to a woman now.  What do you want to do to her?  Just fuck her all night and suck those tits and bang that whore and just slap her on the  ass and take her.  That's a big array.  I'd like to hear that.  My kind of guy.  Huh?  The answer wasn't fun enough.  My kind of guy.  Lady Gaga, what are you talking about my kind of guy?  Nobody's fucking you. 
[03:50:30]  That's crazy talk.  Okay.  Not yet.  But what if we have some serious answers and then like one of these people is going  to be fucking crazy.  And so it's like Mike's, oh, that's nice.  And then Sandy comes out and says something like, what the fuck is she talking about?  Something like that.  That could be the twist.  Let me try someone else.  All right.  Sandy, get over there.  All right.  She's going to show you how it's done, Mike.  Sandy, keep in mind, you're giving your life's great accomplishment, but this has also  got to be for entertainment value.  You know what I mean?  You know how to entertain the people.  I think being honest is what is funny. 
[03:51:00]  Being honest, but being a little, uh, a little triple X extreme.  A little bold.  A little bold.  Be bold and mighty forces will come to you.  Right.  Go.  Mike's greatest accomplishment is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, forget this video.  It's not working.  It's not working at all.  He doesn't, Opie doesn't want the ONA plug.  Okay.  Talk about the greatest dick he ever had.  No, no, the dick, no.  You got something else?  You look great, by the way.  Thank you.  Um, yes.  Sandy, there's more than just Opie here. 
[03:51:30]  I lost the baby weight.  Did you notice?  Well, you lost the baby weight.  Yeah, I gained it.  Thank God you didn't, uh, lose the dick.  No, I got it.  That's right, Sandy.  You didn't lose your dick, Opie.  Thank God.  You still got it.  Okay.  The dick, I mean.  My greatest accomplishment is being the naked cowgirl in Times Square and also just doing  the movie in Berlin, Germany, which is out in theaters all over the world, uh, with my,  um, I love dick.  So anyway, I am naked in Times Square and I finally, um, am making money in my life. 
[03:52:00]  I never made money.  Uh, I've been a stripper all my life with the dildo fuck shows.  I never made money.  I just made enough money to, you know, to, you know, sleep in the street a lot of times.  It was horrible.  They say strippers make a lot of money.  They don't.  But me as a naked cowgirl can go out there fucking, uh, titty naked and, and, and, you  know, just really, uh, stuff like put money under my titty.  Yeah.  Who would ever think that I could actually go topless in Times Square?  And it's so great because I have these wonderful double D tits and I do all kinds of things with 
[03:52:30]  them and I, I just jerk them around.  I show my ass.  I show my ass crack sometimes.  And the cops, they say, the cops allow this?  Yes, they love tits.  They're far from wonderful.  You know, they say, cops like this shit.  It looks disgusting.  So, you know, they, they get off on, and now there's the, I don't know if anyone has  seen these other girls in Times Square.  They, their body painted totally naked with the twat out and everything.  There has been actually naked women in Times Square pussy out and it's, that's it, man. 
[03:53:00]  That's great, lady.  I mean, Sandy King, what's the difference?  Why not?  And, and, you know, let me just leave you with this.  The naked cowboy thinks he was the first one.  I was there before him, inside, at the Metropole Cafe, the Mardi Gras.  I was in every strip club up and down Broadway before I ever, but now it's out in the street  and God bless New York.  She completely ripped him off.  God bless New York.  Freedom. 
[03:53:30]  Bravo.  That was, uh.  Thank you.  That could be made into something.  Yeah.  Lady dies next.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is always not working.  It's not really working.  No, it's not.  Holy fuck.  No, it's not.  We need a better question.  I don't think it's the question.  Maybe we ask him about Santa Claus and Jesus or.  They're all like.  You like that one, Mike, right?  Yeah.  You like that?  Santa Claus.  When I was like 10, we found out.  I told my dad.  That's why we found all the little fucking shitty gifts from you after. 
[03:54:00]  That's a good one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I got all the shitty gifts.  Oh.  All right.  Lady Di is in the hot seat now as Opie films his video.  Yes.  My greatest accomplishment in life.  Start over.  Go.  My greatest accomplishment in life is having my son.  I need you to say that.  All right?  And that was 24 years ago right now.  23 years ago.  That is probably the greatest thing.  Shit.  Couldn't have been that weird.  And let me see.  His dad jumped in front of a train. 
[03:54:30]  Can I say, fucking people are getting too serious.  Yeah, like stop being serious.  Holy shit.  How could it be that great?  Of course that's your greatest accomplishment.  We're going for the goof here.  What about this?  Your greatest accomplishment is that time you whipped out your titties.  My greatest accomplishment was finding out there was no Santa Claus to bring.  She fucked my dad.  He was that idiot.  He lost all that goddamn money.  What about where were you when you found out Santa Claus did not exist?  I was crying my ass with him because I knew the gifts were fucking horrible my dad gave.  He lost all goddamn Christmas presents to a poker game.  We're not going to be able to shoot this while the show's on. 
[03:55:00]  Come on in, Nicole.  Hi, Nicole.  You look great pregnant, by the way.  Doesn't she?  You look amazing pregnant.  Sit down.  How's Taylor doing after the onslaught?  Taylor is Nicole's best friend.  Oh, really?  She's a little bit of trouble.  Is her program director is not happy?  She's not that thrilled.  Why not?  I don't know.  I'm going to find out.  She's still in there getting yelled at.  Is she?  Are you kidding?  Oh, yeah.  You're not kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  That was amazing radio.  I didn't hear it.  I just heard it was...  If you do that every day, okay, I could see where maybe they would have a problem because that's  not the type of radio they do, but as a one-off, who gives a fuck?  What's going on here?  I'm a little nervous of what I just walked into. 
[03:55:30]  It must be nothing.  Opie's flirting.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  It must be nothing.  She was the girl of the other radio show, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because Lady Di showed up and started talking about her baby's daddy throwing himself in  front of a train.  Okay.  And then Sandy Kane showed up and started showing off her pussy.  Okay, cool.  She showed Taylor her pussy and talking about her dildo fuck shows.  And Stalker Patty showed up and started talking about being a virgin.  And apparently that's bad radio?  That's crazy. 
[03:56:00]  I feel left out.  I didn't get to see any pussy this morning.  We should have brought her by the mashup.  That's my fault.  I did not say anything about him.  Hey, Sandy, will you show Nicole Twotto real quick?  Oh, no.  Have you ever seen Twotto?  It's not my pussy.  Hey, talk to the mic.  Get the mic on the thing.  Have you seen Twotto yet?  Twotto is not my pussy.  You've never seen Twotto?  I've seen her around, but I mean, we haven't really gotten to be this close.  Yeah, I don't walk around with Twotto out.  Wait, is that the name of your pussy?  No.  Oh, my God.  You don't want to know.  You've seen Twotto after all these years?  I've seen her.  We haven't actually gotten to.  No, Twotto's a whole thing.  Oh, Twotto is the. 
[03:56:30]  No more talk, Sandy.  You've never seen this?  I need you to show Nicole Twotto.  I'm scared.  Am I going to have nightmares?  Oh, yeah.  Just keep the baby inside, please.  I don't want to have to live with that.  Is this going to send me into early childhood?  Your baby's screaming.  Oh, my God.  Your baby's screaming.  You've never seen that before?  What the fuck is that?  It's a leather Dorito.  Get that removed.  What is that?  We've been trying for 10 years.  Why bother?  Why bother?  Why bother?  To genital wart.  She's about to give birth.  Wait.  No, it's not.  We're thinking it.  It's been there for years. 
[03:57:00]  A very large skin tag or something?  It looks like a happy year, right?  But I know.  Or a leather Dorito.  I was not born with it.  Because sometimes I say, how the fuck did I ever get that on my, you know, it's not vagina.  It's right over here.  Sandy Kane says that it's an ingrown hair.  No, that is not a hair.  No, all I know is I shaved my pussy.  Yeah.  And that happens.  It's for, I know, I know.  Maybe you should look into waxing or lasering.  I think it was God saying someday you're going to be on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:57:30]  I'm going to give you a nice little piece of crap.  Look, Sandy, we only got a couple minutes left.  Should we pick up the phone?  Why?  I don't want to leave him hanging.  He's a good guy.  We're on good terms.  I want to end the year right.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Joe DeRosa.  Joe DeRosa's on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  He moved to Hollywood to help Pete Holmes out.  Oh, great.  Opie, that kind of hurt.  I heard you say why.  See how things change, Joe.  You see how things change.  Now I have your back. 
[03:58:00]  Sorry, Joe.  Yeah, no, Sam, I appreciate it.  You know, that was nice.  I thought my old pal Opie would go, you know, hey, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  How are you?  Happy holidays.  It sounds like a crowded house over there.  I like your Seinfeld bit on Pete Holmes.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, he's only been on the show for a couple months.  He's already got a bit that's gone viral.  And people get mad because it doesn't sound quite like Seinfeld.  Who gives a fuck?  The bit itself is hilarious. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, I like it better because it sounds like DeRosa.  Right.  It's like, I know that.  I'm glad that you pointed out the flaw.  In the bit?  How long did it take?  Oh, I just assumed you weren't trying to sound like Seinfeld.  No, if it sounded exactly like him, I don't think it'd be as funny.  You know what I mean?  What's the name of the bit for the people that haven't found it yet?  Called New Material Seinfeld.  Yeah, that's great.  It's a puppet that just works new material.  It's a puppet of Seinfeld that just works new bits out on Pete. 
[03:59:00]  It's fun, man.  It's really fun to do.  We just get to write these Seinfeld bits.  We actually, we got no time.  How's Hollywood?  We got to go.  Hollywood.  We got to let Ron and Fez come on.  Oh, Joe, we got to go.  Hollywood.  Guys, listen.  It's Ron and Fez's last show on our channel.  Is it really?  We're still pals, though.  They're going to be on Raw Dog.  Okay.  It's going to be great.  That's all.  And we'll still, like, you know, be pals and stuff.  It's going to be awesome.  Don't worry.  All right, Joe.  Guys, I miss you.  Love you, Joe.  Well, Merry Christmas. 
[03:59:30]  I'll talk to you later.  Oh, he sounded sad.  He did sound sad.  Now, before we go.  He's a very lonely man.  I also wanted to remind everybody.  This is our last show before the holidays.  The time is running out.  Oh, God.  The reason it's our last show is because Christmas is just days away.  You know about this, Opie?  If you don't know what you're going to do yet, here's a quick and easy solution that she's  going to love.  What are you going to do?  What do you think it is?  What?  Do I say?  The gift for Christmas for a lady.  I should give a gift for a lady.  Okay, you got to go see Steven Singer, Sam.
