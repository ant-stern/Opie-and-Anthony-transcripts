<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory.  Opie expresses his dissatisfaction with the results, revealing he bought an assault rifle in anticipation of stricter gun control under an Obama administration and plans to post videos of his time at the gun range. Anthony appears more apathetic.  They dissect various reactions to the election, including international responses and misremembered comments attributed to Jesse Jackson (initially thought to be directed at Osama bin Laden).  The hosts lampoon the news media's emotional, rather than analytical, coverage of the election.  A significant portion of the show centers on a running gag about Opie owing Anthony $100 from an election bet. Anthony, refusing to pay, satirizes Obama's policies by claiming he's redistributing the wealth.  This leads to a humorous power struggle where Anthony, leveraging his perceived authority, avoids repaying the debt.  A studio EMT is present and checks Anthony's blood pressure during this exchange. No other guests besides the EMT are mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:00:30]  What a great, great night last night.  An incredible night.  What a great victory.  God, I couldn't be happier.  Why?  The Islanders beat the Rangers last night.  That's what I was going to say, actually.  I was going to say, I know the Islanders won.  I couldn't be happier with the victory last night.  Actually, you know, it wasn't expected.  No, no.  So, the Islanders, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  So glad your mic sounds good today.  Does it?  It's not that, it's not an important day or anything.  Does it?  What is it doing?  It's muffly.  Yeah, it isn't as loud or something.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Good.  I say good.  It'll probably just keep us out of trouble.  You should probably shut it off.  Just shut my mic off.  Keep the show out of trouble today.  Ah, yeah, man.  I can't get, I, I, I.  Can we shut all the TVs off, please?  Why? 
[00:01:30]  Where you have to, like, be informed.  I didn't really mean to do that.  Obama's making history.  Literal Iraq.  Of course he's making history.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  My mic sounds way better than Anthony's.  What?  I don't know.  It's just the way it is.  It's a little off.  Because they did something to it to, you know.  I don't know.  I can't even think.  I'm, I'm, I'm still in shock. 
[00:02:00]  Not that I didn't see it coming.  I knew it was happening.  Did you really?  But, uh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  But the, um, watching the aftermath, uh, was a little too much.  Well, everyone was excited.  No.  Not everyone.  Believe it or not, not everyone was excited.  Just watching the aftermath.  I liked the, um, the world reaction. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they killed a bull, I think, in Obama's honor.  Of course they did.  They, they, they, uh, a few of his, uh, relatives, actually, um, sacrificed some animals over in  Africa.  Well, that's what they do.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they do.  Where's PETA?  Did PETA come out against that yet?  Are they, uh, all up in his grill about, uh, uh,  is, uh, is family sacrificing animals? 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Here's the new national anthem.  What are you doing?  Let's all, what?  Isn't it?  It's a change.  I'm waiting for the change.  I don't know.  He didn't tell me what the change was going to be.  Just a change.  This could be it.  I don't want to hear that I'm getting in trouble for anything.  Anything that I say.  Because it's a whole new world we live in.  That's what, uh, Obama was saying. 
[00:03:30]  Whole new world.  Not just the country.  The whole world is, uh, is going to change.  France sent over a little, uh, tidbit of information that said they couldn't be happier.  Oh, this is fantastic.  And when the French say things are great, there's a problem.  The French.  When have they ever agreed with anything that went on over here?  The French. 
[00:04:00]  Well, it's about time we're on the same team with the French.  Right, Jimmy?  Really?  Oh, boy, yes.  Yeah.  Really?  Same, it's about time we, we, what?  The world loves us again, yes.  Yeah, of course they do.  You got, you got France congratulating us, you got Jesse Jackson crying.  You know, oh, oh, what, he doesn't want to slice off, uh, Obama's, uh, uh, manhood?  What are you talking about?  Like he said, well, it was a very short time ago.  Oh, that's right.  Uh, we caught, uh, Mr. Jackson. 
[00:04:30]  With the live mic.  Live mic on, uh, one of the news channels, and, and there he was.  Saying he'd like to cut off, uh, uh, Osama's, uh, he used a different word for it.  Obama.  Obama.  Obama.  Obama?  Did I say Osama?  Yeah.  Jeez.  You really should get the president's name right.  Yeah.  Do you know that was a real mistake I just made?  Yeah.  I wasn't even joking.  I know.  I wasn't even joking.  I swear to you.  Yeah.  Honest mistake.  It'll happen time and time again, I'm sure. 
[00:05:00]  There's crying Jesse.  I didn't get to cut his...  Well, it's off.  All's forgiven.  Is it?  Yeah.  He's happy.  He's seen a lot of, he's seen a lot of struggle in his lifetime.  It'd be nice watching the Biden daughters grow up, I guess.  Is that them?  What?  That's a...  Paraded out on stage?  That's a newswoman.  What is it?  Where are you looking at?  I don't know.  Everything's happening too fast.  Is anyone working today?  No. 
[00:05:30]  No one's working today?  Look at them banging drums.  What is that?  Just banging on...  Where is it?  They're just banging on some pots and pans, Ant.  They're banging pots and pans.  Did anybody notice?  Who is the...  Who did...  Did Biden bring George Washington on stage?  It was the oldest person I've ever seen.  Who was it?  McCain's grandmother.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  I've never seen an older human.  Change we need.  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  So where's the change?  Oh, here.  At least they're showing some pictures from the good old days. 
[00:06:00]  There it is.  There we go.  Now, they're interviewing only black people, which is wonderful.  The press should summarily be taken out and hung.  And just hung.  They are so divisive and are more responsible for dividing this country than anything since slavery.  Look at this.  What is that woman doing? 
[00:06:30]  What?  She's dancing.  Yeah, dancing.  Some type of dance.  This guy's got two empty beer bottles.  Yeah, two empty beer bottles clanging them together.  Dude, it looks like the party scene before the machines attacked in the Matrix.  Where they're all in the big cave there.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do with myself.  So yesterday, I did the only thing I knew what to do. 
[00:07:00]  Go to the gun range.  I bought a new gun.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  But a wonderful new rifle that is going to be impossible to get very shortly.  Wonderful.  I believe they call it an assault rifle.  I bought one of those.  Went to the range.  That's how you celebrated?  You got an assault rifle yesterday?  So I spent election day, bought myself a nice new, you know, I bought some merchandise that my Second Amendment tells me I can get. 
[00:07:30]  And then I'm not going to be able to.  So that's going to be my thing.  I'm going to take all the money that is going to be taken away from me, and instead, I'm just going to buy guns with it.  By the way, the gun store, again, packed.  Packed with people.  They are selling out.  Obama has sold more guns during his campaign than even Clinton did.  This I heard directly from the owner of the gun store. 
[00:08:00]  And the workers at the gun store.  That Obama has sold more guns.  They can't even order more.  They can't make them fast enough.  They've sold out of what they call assault rifles.  Because people know they're just going to be taken away again.  Why are you depressed?  Why?  You have a good life.  Because I have a president that does not represent me.  I have a president now that will be inaugurated in January that does not represent me or my interests. 
[00:08:30]  Or that of a lot of the American people.  That's why.  And that's an honest answer.  It doesn't.  And the Democrats seem to have taken over.  They did a good job.  I blame it squarely on George W. Bush and his eight years of shenanigans.  This Barack fell into a perfect storm to get him into office. 
[00:09:00]  Because we had a jackass in the White House for eight years that did nothing but perpetuate a war that mission accomplished was supposed to be over years ago.  And did nothing else.  An economy that turned around and is floundering.  And he was able to walk right in.  A Sarah Palin.  That was a good choice. 
[00:09:30]  You know what though?  I don't even think that would have helped.  Tell you the truth.  I'll be honest with you.  That wasn't helping.  Sarah Palin wasn't running for all these Senate slots.  Congressional slots that got taken over by Democrats.  People were sick of George W. Bush.  Sick of that.  But they were able to attach George W. Bush to McCain and, you know, the same old policies, the same old white guy.  Yeah.  Poor America with stupid old white guys in charge. 
[00:10:00]  Been a nation of pioneers, inventors, top of the food chain in the world.  And that had to be changed, I guess.  So we're down to the president's family sacrificing animals and clips that, I swear to you, from Africa that looked like National Geographic channel.  Well, the world's happy, Ant.  The world's happy.  The world is very happy.  Well, half the country's miserable.  You weren't caught up in any of the excitement last night? 
[00:10:30]  I was disgusted by the excitement.  What about the crowd?  Because the press did nothing but pander to African-Americans and shove microphones in their face and get a response that was based on nothing but emotion and not about leadership in this country, about what's actually best for the country.  Is George W. Bush best for this country?  F no.  Don't even make the mistake of trying to pin that one on me because it's not. 
[00:11:00]  He's not best for this country.  But is Barack Obama?  No.  Well, we don't know yet.  No.  You know something?  He hasn't even done a day in Washington.  I do know.  In the White House.  He's going to have pretty much a rubber stamp to do whatever he wants.  And his ideology is socialist.  And already they're talking about Corazine as being his treasury secretary. 
[00:11:30]  Tax him Corazine.  From Jersey.  Old tax him Corazine.  The guy was in office, I don't know how long, a few days.  It would have been sooner if he didn't almost kill himself in that car wreck.  And he wants him as treasury secretary.  Because they want a good tax him guy in there.  Carolyn McCarthy wins again.  On Long Island for Nassau County.  That's good.  Oh, buddy Gary Ackerman's back in. 
[00:12:00]  Gary!  He's holding the job like a pope.  Good old Gary Ackerman.  I mean, is this a bad time to ask for my $100?  For what?  What do I owe you $100 for?  Do I owe you $100?  I'm just asking.  Is it a bad time?  I don't know.  You're a bit too fair.  A bit too fair-skinned for me to give $100 to.  My money, I feel, is not going to be going to you, Opie.  But, you know, you're good for it, right?  What?  Maybe I should ask you tomorrow or Friday.  You're not getting anything from me, including a wedding gift. 
[00:12:30]  I'm a little strapped these days.  I'm a little strapped.  But aren't you a man of your word?  What did I say?  Well, we go back in time for this clip.  Well, the obsession with Palin is unbelievable.  The paper, that's all they have in the paper.  She's nuts.  Palin this, Palin that.  I'll bet...  She's nuts.  I'll bet $100 right now that McCain wins.  All right.  She's...  Let me get my $100 now.  You are a man of your word.  That's right.  $100 for each of us.  What? 
[00:13:00]  I was there.  Did I bet everybody?  Yes.  Well, I don't know.  We're going to continue with the clip.  But, you know, is it a bad time?  I need change.  Is it a bad time?  I need change.  Is it a $1,000 bill on you?  Change.  How rich are you?  Change we need right now.  I want crisp bills, too.  I need change like Obama.  Wait, let's listen to the rest.  What is this?  What fire are they putting out?  What happened?  Let me listen to the rest of this clip, see how much money you owe today.  All right.  She's...  Really?  Yeah.  I got that with you, too.  I've got $100.  She's nuts.  Who's that?  Every photo she has, her eyes have that 1,000-yard stare, that psycho girl, just her eyes are 
[00:13:30]  wide open, looking right through her.  How much money do I owe?  She's a fruitcake.  Yeah.  I'll take the $100 bet for a goof.  What the hell?  Will you?  All right.  We'll bet $100 on the election.  I'll take it, too.  You want to do two?  I think Kalen's going to really mess up.  Did you...  You want a piece of the action there?  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  McCain wins, I give you $100.  Obama wins, you give me $100.  You can't lose.  Just don't forget the 21-point spread. 
[00:14:00]  What's the VIG?  I think he covered the spread.  I'll bet $25.  Wow!  All right.  All right.  So I'm in for $225.  Two and a quarter.  Go $100.  $100.  $300.  Go $300.  Giving me the money when McCain wins.  Giving you money while you're just lying.  You probably get it changed into one so you can throw it in your pool.  I'll throw it and get paper cuts on my schween.  All right.  We're back live.  Jimmy, you need a better manager or something.  I'd like my $25, Anthony.  I owe $225. 
[00:14:30]  I'd like my $25.  I'm seeing your hands.  Give me.  With the new administration, there's change.  Yeah.  Change is in the air, and I'm changing the bet.  You can't.  Why?  You're a betting man.  You're a man of your word.  That's right.  I think it's hilarious that Jimmy only bet $25.  I only said $25 because it's a line from Cuckoo's Nest.  Opie.  Yes.  We have to spread the wealth.  All right.  I'm taking the $225. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  No, no, no.  That I'm supposed to give you.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no, no.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  This is what you got to get used to.  No, see?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  You might not think it's fair, but you better get used to it.  I'm taking your $100, and I'm giving it to someone less fortunate than you.  Me.  Well, how about...  No!  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll take your $100.  No ifs, there's a must.  There's no one to argue for you.  Hold on.  There's no one to argue for you anymore.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll take your $100.  What?  And I will promise you this.  I will leave the studio immediately, and I will hand it over to the darkest, 
[00:15:30]  this guy I can see on the street.  No!  That's not how it works.  You don't get to say where it goes.  See?  This is how it works.  But you're not the president!  This is the change.  Give me my $100!  Nope.  Jimmy, demand your $25.  See?  I'd like my $25, please.  Get used to it, fellas!  Anthony.  I'm not going to have it, because I have to...  I fall into the category where my wealth has to be redistributed.  But not to you.  He's not the...  Hey?  You fall in the category.  Now I have to give it to less fortunate. 
[00:16:00]  Sorry!  You lose!  He's not the president yet.  That's it.  He's not the president yet.  I'm the president of me!  I'm the president of me!  He's not the president yet.  Give me my $100!  President of me!  Give me my $100!  Sorry!  Give me!  Sorry!  Give me!  Going to less fortunate!  Give me!  Not you!  Me!  Sorry!  Me!  Ain't gonna happen!  He's not the president.  Why don't you go to somebody...  We're still under the old rules here.  Go to somebody...  There's no new rules yet?  Go to somebody that you can take it up with and try to get it from you. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's right.  The Democrats run everything, so you won't be able to get anything either.  There's no one here to defend you or change things.  So what I say goes.  I got a rubber stamp.  I'm giving it to the less fortunate.  You're really not getting it.  You're really not gonna give me my $100?  No!  But that's not like you.  Get used to it.  No, it's like Obama.  I'm with the change.  He's not in yet.  He's in.  Not yet.  He doesn't become president until what?  January or whatever.  Yeah, thank you.  Oh, stop.  January 21st.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:17:00]  It sure does matter.  I'm enacting his policies right now.  Right now.  Really?  This is the big change.  You want to start paying more taxes right now?  Well, apparently I am.  No, not yet.  Because I'm taking the money that is supposed to go to you, but you're too well off.  I'm too well off, so I give it to the less fortunate.  I'm spreading it around.  All right.  Who are you going to give it to?  Joe the plumber.  Where is he?  I don't know.  I'll look for someone with plumber butt crack outside, and I'll shove it down like a strip club.  We have an EMT guy here.  You want your blood pressure taken? 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Is he here right now?  Oh, he's here.  I want to see if Anthony's staying calm today.  Give me, uh, I'll take my blood pressure.  See what it is.  What do you usually, uh, you're normal.  1,000 over 6 million.  You're usually what?  120 over 80?  Yeah.  That's about normal?  Yeah.  Let's see.  How you doing, sir?  That's Jim.  You want to do left arm, right arm?  What do you want?  He's an EMT guy.  He's going to take Anthony's blood pressure.  Here we go.  All right.  You can give me the 100 while he's doing it. 
[00:18:00]  Double or nothing on my blood pressure.  Oh, that, that.  This feels good.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to get a reading any second?  I think you're doing all right.  Surprising.  Your blood pressure's nice.  It is, isn't it?  10 over 70.  What's that?  110 over 70.  110 over 70. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  I'm running a little low today.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Oh, Christ.  All right.  The phones are lit.  I need more heroin, though, to keep it down that low.  The phones are lit.  877-212-ONA.  Lots of audio to play.  God, where are we going to go next?  So much going on.  I have some YouTube videos I put up last night, too.  I used my flip, my little flip down at the range yesterday, so you could see my array 
[00:19:00]  of pistols and whatnot.  It was a lot of fun.  Fired off my laser, my little laser sight on my SIG-45.  It's kind of fun to watch.  And I did, like I said, I went into the gun store.  I bought what is labeled an assault rifle, and I will be picking up more, just because  there'll be collector's items.  Won't be getting those no more.  Got a lot of guns, my friend.  They'll enact that.  I'm a collector.  You got a lot of guns.  I'm a collector. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  We're going to go to the phones next and see what the people are saying today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. </pre>
