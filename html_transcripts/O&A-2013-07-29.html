<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an interview of professional wrestler Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka.  Snuka discussed his autobiography, detailing his life in Fiji, his wrestling career (starting in Portland, Oregon around 1969), his time in the WWF (now WWE), his extensive travels, numerous extramarital relationships ("ring rats"), struggles with cocaine addiction, and his signature move, the “Superfly splash.” He also talked about his relationships with other wrestlers, including criticizing Hulk Hogan and mentioning Jesse Ventura.  He proudly spoke about his daughter, Tamina Snuka, also a professional wrestler. The interview included graphic sexual content, vulgar language, and a detailed account of a tragic accident involving a woman's death near his car and the subsequent investigation.

The show then transitioned to “Jocktober,” a recurring segment featuring listener-submitted photos and stories, many of which were sexually explicit and offensive.  A large portion focused on ridicule of radio host Terry Clifford, using extremely offensive language targeting her weight and appearance. This continued with further discussion of Jocktober submissions and hosts' commentary.  This segment also included further discussion of Terry Clifford, recounting an encounter with one of the hosts, leading to more crude jokes about her weight and appearance.  Past Jocktober segments and listener responses were discussed, revealing extreme negativity toward Clifford.

The conversation then shifted to prank calls, with hosts and a guest, Jimmy, recounting offensive and potentially illegal prank calls from their youth, including bomb threats.  They reminisced about using AOL, dial-up internet, and the challenges of prank calling in the pre-cell phone era, including accidentally sending inappropriate texts.

Michael Clarke Duncan then joined the show in studio. After briefly reminiscing about a past WrestleMania encounter, they discussed his career, including a period of homelessness, his work as a bodyguard, and his thoughts on other famous bodyguards like Mr. T. Duncan elaborated on his career path, starting with early life aspirations, a brief period on welfare in Los Angeles, and eventual success in the entertainment industry after working as a security guard on sets (including *Living Single* and *Jamie Foxx*). He shared a funny anecdote about carrying Queen Latifah on his back to a set and discussed his acting journey, including working with Larry Moss, and films like *Armageddon* and *The Green Mile*. He also discussed his role in *The Finder*, his relaxed attitude towards reviews, and his girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault from *The Apprentice*.  He also shared anecdotes about filming *Talladega Nights*, including an ad-libbed line with Will Ferrell, and encounters with Keith Sutherland and Dennis Rodman. The hosts presented Jim Norton with a surprise birthday cake, leading to discussion about a topless basketball team and their appearance on the show, followed by an extended and somewhat awkward interaction with a female guest from the team, focusing on her hairstyle and attempts to get her to remove her top. Jim Florentine's marriage was also briefly mentioned.

The next segment focused on Jimmy Norton's birthday and the female guest, "Dice," promoting her show.  The conversation quickly became sexually explicit, with crude comments about Dice's body.  A bizarre incident occurred where Jimmy Norton's shirt was cut open near his breasts at his request, leading to further sexually charged discussion of her body. The hosts then engaged in a discussion about the sizes and features of female genitalia, using vulgar language.  A physical altercation interrupted the conversation when publicist "Lainey" was hit by a door opened by staff member "Kenny."  The conversation then shifted to hygiene, specifically using a sock to clean urine, leading to a lengthy and explicit call-in segment with listeners sharing experiences and opinions.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Norton's birthday "gift," Lainey's injury, and Opie sharing an embarrassing anecdote about picking his nose in an elevator.

The final segment started with a discussion about bodily fluids, including graphic descriptions and anecdotes, featuring a caller who collects snot.  A large booger was also described and shown.  The hosts debated the repulsiveness of various bodily substances, including a digression about masturbating while driving.  Olive, a previous guest, called in, discussing her experience with Ian Halperin, clarifying she's an actress and model, not an escort, and detailing her compensation for appearances.  The hosts then discussed Halperin's behavior.  Halperin called in, explaining his previous appearance as research for a book on Craigslist, addressing the fallout from the show, including Anthony’s desire for a boxing match (which Halperin declined). He also briefly discussed his book about Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The show concluded with a discussion about past employees, including racially charged comments about "sassy black bitches," "sassy Puerto Rican" women, and generalizations about black people working in customer service. A positive experience at a “gay supermarket” was contrasted with negative experiences with black female employees. The conversation ended with an anecdote about one host's mother, a strong black woman, and her interactions with retail employees.  The segment was filled with profanity and racially charged language.

[00:00:30]  Damn.  The legend himself.  Back in studio.  Superfly.  The Jimmy Snooker stories.  The book that's out now.  And I guess, what does this cover?  Your wrestling days or your entire life?  My entire life, brother.  Entire life.  Yeah.  From the early days before wrestling.  I don't know much about you before wrestling, pre-wrestling.  What can we expect in the book about you growing up?  The young, the young Superfly.  Right.  What happened?  It's all in that book, brother.  It's all in there?  Yep.  What was it like growing up?  Where did you grow up?  Well, actually, I started out in the Fiji. 
[00:01:00]  I was born in the Fiji Islands.  Fiji's nice.  Yes.  Is it nice this time of year?  The Fiji?  Fiji's nice.  Fiji's nice, right?  Oh, it's lovely, bro.  I don't know if you like the hot weather, brother.  Love it.  I love the hot weather, brother.  Love the heat.  There you go.  Dan, I love Fiji.  I got to get my ass to Fiji one of these days.  So you were a bodybuilder before you started wrestling?  Is that what you were doing first?  Right.  I was a bodybuilder and a martial arts, you know?  And so that's how I got involved into wrestling.  You know, I started out in Honolulu, Hawaii, you know? 
[00:01:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And then what finally, like, how did you connect with, like, Vince McMahon and all that?  How did you finally get into the main spotlight?  Well, I was wrestling for a while there in Hawaii, then from Hawaii I went to Portland, Oregon.  About what year was this?  When I went to Portland, Oregon, it was around 69.  Oh, wow.  Portland, Oregon.  Big wrestling scene in Portland?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Who knew?  That was my first territory that I ever wrestled in.  Pacific Northwest. 
[00:02:00]  Yes, sir.  In the house.  Yep.  So I've been there for, like, good eight years.  Uh-huh.  And I've been traveling in and out to all different parts of the countries, whatever, you know,  the referees, I mean, the management, you know, the...  I hear you.  You know, the...  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah, you know, the promoter in Chicago, you're saying.  Where they take you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wherever...  They call up Don Owens.  He's the one that the promoter in Portland, Oregon.  So they'll call him up and say, hey, can we borrow this guy, you know? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's how it was before Vince, like, brought everything together, right?  Exactly, bro.  And then brought out what I call the golden age of wrestling, which is...  It was like the slave trade back in the...  Yeah, right.  He's borrowing people like that.  And then, of course, your heyday in the WWF, what it was at the time.  I mean, we all remember some of these great off the corner, off the ropes, you flying through  the air.  Just fantastic. 
[00:03:00]  What were those days like?  A lot of traveling, of course, you see in the world.  What about girls?  Were there a lot of girls, a lot of groupies?  There's a lot of them.  There's like a, you know, a train behind your car following you.  Really?  Really?  It's crazy.  Hot girls.  Superfly.  Did you sleep with any of them, or did you tell them to get out of here?  I've got wrestling to do.  You know, but I thought that's exactly what you said, you know?  You put up numbers.  I've got wrestling to do here, but, you know.  You put up some numbers, didn't you, Superfly?  I bet he put up some numbers.  You know, it was pretty nice, you know, nice. 
[00:03:30]  You stick any pigs?  I loved it.  Oh, Jesus.  I had a good time.  Yeah, yeah, I don't doubt it.  I don't doubt it.  Any pigs?  Any pigs in there?  Oh, jeez, Opie.  Well, sometimes the pigs will give you the best lay.  Superfly knows?  You stick any pigs?  I bet they were very attractive girls.  Every single one was attractive?  Back in the day.  Yeah, that's what they called them.  Ring rats.  Ring rats.  Ring rats.  Ring rats.  Oh, and they'd hang around after the matches and suck their dick.  They know exactly where you're staying.  Yeah.  I mean, it's amazing, brothers.  Any of those stories in the book?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Get into that a little bit.  We've got some in there.  Why do you think his nickname was Superfly?  Oh.  Pulling down that fly.  I don't think that was it, Opie.  Showing the cock.  Oh, jeez.  What is that necessary for, Sam?  What happened?  Sam.  I speak his language.  Look at him smiling like a lunatic over there.  Love it.  Love it.  And you were very open about, like, you know, things kind of went bad for a little while  with the drugs and the partying.  I mean, it happens.  Got caught up in that lifestyle?  Oh, yeah, brother.  I can't lie about that.  I mean, it's right in front of you, you know. 
[00:04:30]  How long of a period did that last, and when was that?  Gosh.  You know, I guess I must have maybe back in the 70s, 80s.  Oh, 70s, 80s?  What was your poison, Superfly?  What's that, brother?  What was your poison?  What did you like?  What kind of drugs?  Were you doing a little tuning?  Well, you know, I mean, brother, it was all over the place.  Like, you know, I like to have a little medicine, you know?  A little medicine.  Yeah.  Superfly like medicine.  But, you know, everything was everywhere. 
[00:05:00]  You know what?  Those times, I mean, everybody was getting into it.  It's incredible, brother.  And especially that you're in the limelight.  You're a star.  What was it?  Was it drinking?  Was it cocaine?  Was it heroin?  Were you smoking the crack?  What was your poison?  I wasn't smoking any crack.  All right.  Good for you, Superfly.  No, not at all.  No.  No shots.  No nothing.  Little nose candy.  Little nose candy.  Little nose candy.  Everyone was doing it.  Sam Roberts has been known for it.  What did you do last week? 
[00:05:30]  On a ring rat's nipple?  It was only when he was in, you know, WWF.  Only WWF.  Of course.  Ferris Bueller's friend.  I'm the co-author.  I'm the co-author.  Co-author.  Author.  What?  Ah.  Is that it?  Okay, sure.  So what were you saying?  Did you ever before a match?  I'm Jimmy's Asian.  Okay.  You ever do it before a match?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  I guess it made it taking bumps a little bit easier.  You got to, man.  You know, I mean, them days was crazy.  So I said, hey.  Oh, man.  Hey, the first time you super flied off the top. 
[00:06:00]  Super flied.  Well, yeah, but did you.  That's what it was.  Did you plan on doing that or did that just kind of happen and you're like, hey, that worked?  Well, brother, you see, I started, you know, how I got that super fly name is that I used to dive off cliffs in the islands.  Oh, cliff diving.  You were a cliff diver?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Respect.  And so when I got broken into the business, the wrestling business, then I said, well, that's what I'm going to do.  I don't see nobody doing it, so I'm going to do it.  So you weren't afraid to jump like that from that height? 
[00:06:30]  You can't have no fear.  That's a joke, right, from that?  You got to go.  After doing it from a cliff.  That was good.  Did you do that when you cliff dive?  You put up your fucking hands like that?  I'm going to fly like a bird, man.  Yeah, huh?  You ever hit any rocks on the way down?  Oh, man.  Hey, so those guys, who rocks on the way down?  I don't think you can...  I don't think you can ask that question of anybody.  Because I think if they hit the rocks, they're dead.  I don't know.  Maybe he fucking took out an ankle or something.  Oh, man.  God forbid.  What's the worst injury you had jumping off on?  You must have got hurt or missed somebody or hit the knee by mistake. 
[00:07:00]  You know what, bro?  To be honest with you guys, I never really got hurt.  Wow, lucky man.  Lucky man.  You ever do any of that muck diving?  It's got to be done right, brother.  You know, can't muck get around.  You got one body.  Take care of it.  Right, right, right.  Do it right, man.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, exactly.  You did in there?  That's...  Wow, what a career.  What a career.  What did you do right after wrestling?  You wrestled for those years.  What happened?  Is it hard to kind of go back to civilian life after being this superstar, 
[00:07:30]  and then you just kind of live in day-to-day after that or a normal life?  How hard is that?  Yeah, just a regular normal life, bro, you know?  Like when I went back to Hawaii, I just took some time off, too,  and just go surfing, you know?  Oh, man.  I like that.  Yeah, I love to surf, bro.  20 feet waves.  Really?  Right in Sunset Beach, Hawaii.  And people would be like, hey, that's Superfly out there.  Don Morocco lives right there, too.  Don Morocco?  Yeah.  Are you guys friends?  Oh, yeah.  You guys...  We know each other when we was back in Hawaii.  Wow.  You see any sharks when you were surfing? 
[00:08:00]  A lot of sharks out there.  Oh, yeah.  That's all the time, brothers.  He's got the shark tooth around his neck.  I see that.  Shark tooth necklace.  Fucking rustle that shark and take that tooth.  Oh, he probably frigging slammed him, right?  Woo!  Just got up on a wave slam.  He got up on top of a wave, dove off on the shark.  I'm taking that tooth.  Yeah, the ref goes in.  Man!  He's out.  And then he's right back in the fucking surf.  Oh, yeah.  That's right, brother.  Yeah.  Are you still friends with Bob Backlund?  Oh, I'm friends with all of them.  You know, Bob?  Yeah.  I love them all, bro.  What about the Polish Hammer?  Well, I have a Polish Hammer.  Ivan Putzky.  Ivan Putzky.  Putzky. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, he's a putz.  Really nice guy.  Putzky.  Do you still watch wrestling or do you not like to watch it?  Oh, yeah.  I watch it every Monday, whenever it's on.  Yeah.  You know, I have my daughter on there now.  Oh, man.  You know, so I get to watch that.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Wait, his daughter's in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, your daughter's wrestling?  Yes.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  That's pretty good, you know, keeping the name going, right?  The legacy.  They wanted it, and I said, all right, it ain't going to be easy.  No, huh?  So, you know, I took her into the ring, you know, gave a few points on how to wrestle 
[00:09:00]  and use psychology and everything else.  So, anyway, we went into the ring, and she superfied me like four times.  Oh, man.  All right, here's the ring.  I moved out, like, say, about a couple of feet, maybe from here to here.  Then she dove on me on this first rope, in the bottom one, and then I moved out some  more, and I told her to go up to the second rope.  Then she dove, you know, and nailed me again. 
[00:09:30]  That's great.  Here it comes.  Here comes the third rope.  All right.  I moved all the way back, and the way into the center of the ring.  Yeah.  So, now you can go to that top.  Damn.  And she did.  Brother, I was.  Proud moment.  Does she put her hands up?  Does she put her hands up?  Better than the superfly.  Does she put her hands up like that?  Oh, yes.  Really?  Keeping the legacy going.  I did, brother.  I like it.  What's her wrestling name?  What name does she wrestle under?  Penina.  Penina.  Tamina.  Tamina.  Tamina Snuka.  Tamina. 
[00:10:00]  Tamina.  Tamina Snuka.  Yeah.  Tamina Snuka.  Hold on.  You got a picture?  Wait, man.  I'm going to tell you something there, Mr. Superfly Snuka.  Lovely.  Attractive daughter right there, huh?  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Do you agree?  I know all your brothers in love with that.  Oh, man.  What are you going to do, right?  Twist your dick right off.  Imagine that.  You want to go out on a date.  You got to go meet Jimmy Superfly Snuka at the front door.  I don't know about that.  That's like, hey, brother.  I'm really proud of her.  Hey, I got a wrestling question.  Very nice.  Wouldn't you agree that the intercontinental belt is just a waste? 
[00:10:30]  What?  Oh, B.  What?  Come on.  How about some knowledge before you spout off something like that?  Is that a waste?  My God.  It's bullshit.  It's a championship belt.  The intercontinental is a...  What?  Was he the champion?  The IC champion?  Were you the IC champion?  Intercontinental.  Intercontinental.  You were an IC champ, were you?  No.  See, then it is a waste.  If it's not the championship belt, why would you fight for it?  Were you...  Did Vince want you to kind of be the top guy, but the stuff on the side was to... 
[00:11:00]  Was your personal life in turmoil, and that kind of kept you from...  Who was it that came in there at that time?  Hogan.  Were you supposed to be the top guy, and then Hogan came in?  Well, you see, at the time, before Hogan came in, me and Darren carried the whole territory.  That's right.  Yeah.  And then when he made that movie, and then, you know, it came out, I guess...  After Rocky III.  Right.  Exactly.  Right, right. 
[00:11:30]  And that's when he came into the business and everything else, you know, and...  And fucked over Superfly.  Oh, fuck Hulk Hogan.  Hey, buddy.  Fuck him.  You were the man.  You were the man.  You were the man before Hulk Hogan.  Fuck that guy.  Thunder Lips.  Thunder Lips.  He knows.  Thunder Lips.  Thunder Lips is a queer.  Oh, Jesus.  Did you see Hulk's sex tape?  Did you see the sex tape with Hulk Hogan?  No, I didn't.  Oh, my God.  Scandalous.  Very big penis.  Scandalous.  Very impressive. 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  Very impressive.  Yes.  That's a scandal you don't need to get involved in there.  No, no.  Superfly Snooker.  We don't know how he kept that in his type.  It's the best movie he ever made, though.  Yeah.  That's true.  Oh, shit.  You didn't like the one where he was wearing the tutu?  Oh, wait.  That was a rock.  Hey, we like the rock, though.  Don't mess with the rock.  Do you do any movies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A bunch of movies.  I got two of them.  One is...  Oh, man.  I did one up in...  Canada, I believe.  Buffalo, New York.  Buffalo. 
[00:12:30]  That way, yeah.  Good stab at that one.  Uh-huh.  Yep.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  I didn't see...  I've never seen a movie.  Sam, you want to help me out?  Yeah, I think...  What movie?  My wife, she knows the name.  Yeah, you're going to...  IMDB, I could have done that.  You should know.  You're the wrestling guy.  I bet Fezzy would know.  I'll lose something, man.  Lose that competition.  He was in the King's speech.  What?  No, I'm just...  Ah, funny.  Funny guy over there.  Yeah, I got two words for you.  Jesse Ventura.  Go.  Oh, what do you think?  Nice, brother.  Yeah, you like Jesse?  Good, brother.  Big fans here. 
[00:13:00]  We love that guy.  We started out together in Bull and Oregon.  I think he's batshit crazy, but, you know, what are you going to do?  I think everything's a conspiracy.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  Jesse the body.  Yeah.  Well, he was a lot of fun, though, in the ring with a feather boa, very flamboyant.  Those days were a lot of fun.  I mean, I appreciate what goes on now in wrestling, but when you guys are out there, there was some  great storylines, a lot of fun going on.  I bet a lot of cow snapping in the locker room. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, the old school days, brother, you've got to be here that you want it, or you don't.  Right.  Step out.  Yeah, yeah.  That's got it.  Truer words have never been said.  You were right in the middle of it.  Right out there.  But I came in at the right time, brother.  You ever knock heads with Vince McMahon?  Everyone's had their little battles with Vince McMahon.  We've spoken at Triple H, and a bunch of guys that at some point or another have had  some words with Vince.  You ever have any trouble with Vince?  I've been pretty good with him, you know? 
[00:14:00]  A couple of times, maybe?  Well, we don't argue anything.  You know, we just...  Jimmy, get in here!  What the hell do you think?  Yeah, I always call him Vinny, you know?  Vinny?  Vinny, yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't think Mr. McMahon appreciates that.  Brother Vinny.  Yeah.  That's fun.  I might want to call him that if I ever see him again.  Yeah.  Brother Vinny, shut up!  Do you get recognized everywhere still?  Everywhere you get recognized, right?  Yeah, brother.  You know, I'm very blessed.  Walk down the street, you hear, Superfly! 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I love it, man.  I love him, brother.  Very cool.  Where do you leave off in the book?  Like, does it open for a sequel?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing these days with yourself?  I'm still wrestling.  You're still wrestling?  Still wrestling.  This is insane.  I've got a lot of raising fun, you know, independence, wounded warriors, you name it, brother.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Wounded warriors.  Yeah.  God bless you, Jimmy.  Yeah, I love it, brother.  Superfly.  I love it.  So you're out there still wrestling?  Still going, brother. 
[00:15:00]  Holy mother of God.  Still flying around.  That's crazy.  You still jump off the top rope?  Oh, yes.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's all they want to see, brother.  They don't care about anything else.  Jimmy doesn't do that.  They're like, wait a minute, something's missing.  Yeah, I hear you.  They just want to see me climb up there and ba-boom.  How high up do you go these days?  Probably whatever high it can go.  Really?  Let's do one.  Oh, man.  Let's do one.  No, we're not going to do one in here.  Why?  Right off the counter?  Yeah, off the counter.  That's not that high.  That's like second rope shit. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  He's super fly.  No.  Lovely, lovely.  That's crazy.  How long do you work out every day?  How often do you work out?  I don't work out as hard as I used to, but I still maintain, you know, my training and everything.  Yeah, you look like you're in very good shape.  In case I've got to go back wrestling and stuff.  Yeah, Jimmy still looks like he's a fucking, he's thrown out.  Yeah, absolutely.  You'd be a problem.  I've got to tell you something, Mr. Superfly.  We had you on the show probably 13 years ago, in 2000, on the show. 
[00:16:00]  You seem a lot more, like, healthier and, like, into what you're doing and with it.  More so than you did 13 years ago.  Thank you.  What's the change?  What happened?  What's the difference?  Brother, there's no change.  The Superfly is still the same, bro.  I like it.  When I go in there.  I'll make you happy.  Hope for us all.  When I go in there, the brother's going to tune it up, man.  Tune it up.  You got it.  That's what I hear.  And are you mentoring these young kids, some of the young kids in wrestling?  Oh, yes, all the time.  They always come around when I'm there and pick on my brain a little bit, you know, and 
[00:16:30]  what can I do, you know, what can I not do?  It's like talking to the legend when you're in wrestling and stuff.  You're having to talk to Jimmy Superfly.  Snooker like that.  Amazing.  Get some pointers.  Oh, yeah.  I love it, brother.  You were a great showman back in the day, as I'm sure you still are now and everything,  but, like, that was, to watch you launch off that top rope, fantastic.  Thank you, brother.  That's fantastic.  What is your ring?  You got a couple of really great rings.  Yeah, one was from the WWE Hall of Fame, and this one here was from up in Amsterdam, 
[00:17:00]  New York.  Oh.  You know, Hall of Fame rings.  Oh, man.  Hall of Fame rings.  That's like you stole someone's Super Bowl ring.  Thank you guys very much for that.  Yeah, I looked at your Super Bowl ring.  Thank you very much.  You stole someone's Super Bowl ring.  When he puts those fingers up like that, you get to see the shit.  That's right.  Lovely.  Lovely.  Lovely.  I love the voice.  Yeah.  Jimmy Superfly.  So, do you, do you, uh,  do you, have you cut down on the unhealthy activity?  Because you look very good.  Yes.  He doesn't know more drugs or any of that stuff.  Right.  Right.  All that is gone. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, okay.  Good man.  Good man.  Good, good, good.  Them days were, you know, sickening, man.  Hey, you know what?  Probably a day or two was pretty fun, though.  Oh, you know, there's some fun times.  Probably a couple of days, maybe you had a good time.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to, brother.  Of course, Mr. Superfly, Jimmy, Superfly Snooker.  Are you a married man there?  Yes, sir, I am.  How many years, sir?  Right now, me and my wife, I think about 15 years now.  All right.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  That's pretty good.  Younger lady than you?  Oh, she's much younger.  Oh, Mr. Snooker.  And even better looking than I am.  Get out of here.  That's hard to believe.  That's hard to believe, sir.  Come on.  How old of a gal is she?  18.  18.  After 15 years.  Very good, Superfly.  That's fantastic.  I'm so glad.  Are we doing book signings or anything?  No book signings?  Yeah.  We have a book signing in Yonkers on Saturday.  Yes.  He's returning to Stanford at 5 o'clock on Saturday also. 
[00:18:30]  To do it.  At the Barnes & Noble.  Oh, Stanford, yes.  The headquarters are out there, sure.  And then a week from Saturday, he'll be in White Plains, New York.  Okay.  Is there a central website people can go to?  Because they're driving right now.  Where can they go to find out where the book signings are?  What's your website?  Is it JimmySuperflySnooker?  Yes.  JimmySuperflySnooker.com.  And you do address, which I like in the book, the situation, obviously this very sad situation 
[00:19:00]  where the girl died.  You don't shy away from that.  You do talk about it in the book.  I'm going to be honest, brother.  What happened that day?  You opened up.  That's amazing.  That's great.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  What happened that day?  It's in the book.  We were driving down to Highlandtown for the TV the next day.  Yeah.  So the girl, you know, wanted to use the bathroom, you know?  Right.  So she got out and went to go use the bathroom, pulled over to the side. 
[00:19:30]  And I guess after she got done, she came back over like a stream that was there.  She jumped and slipped and banged her head.  And I thought she was okay.  I'm waiting in the car.  Sure.  And then sure enough, I looked out and I go, my goodness, what's going on here?  So, you know, when I got in, brought her back in the car and took off, went to Allentown  and called up the ambulance, bro.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are the odds?  Freak accident, huh?  I was going nuts. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, man.  What's she doing now?  What?  What happened?  Jesus, Opie.  What?  I don't know.  She didn't make it.  She died not there, though.  No, no, no.  It wasn't there.  It was next morning.  Next morning.  Oh, man.  That's tragic.  And were you a suspect at all?  Wow.  Did they suspect you?  I had no idea.  Well, they were asking me questions and stuff like that, you know?  And I had to tell them the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Jimmy didn't talk about it for years. 
[00:20:30]  Right, right.  Well, first of all, it's sad.  It's tragic.  It's a sad thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And in this book, he just wanted to because, you know, obviously, if he doesn't address  it, then everyone's going to assume that it's a lot of shit.  No, that's good.  You know, and you've moved on.  Some years have passed.  You want to get that out there?  Sure.  Like everything in the book.  I like that.  Open, honest.  You want to find out everything you want to know about Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  It's right there in the book.  Exactly.  How about when Roddy cracked you in the head with a coconut? 
[00:21:00]  Holy Jesus.  But he did.  Now that you've mentioned that, I'm getting a heady.  Oh, man.  Terrible.  Back to fun.  Yeah, it was a perfect interview.  It was meant to be, brother.  That's how we started our whole program.  And that's the way it started, from the coconut on the head.  The coconut on the head.  Can you imagine that?  Yeah.  It hurts.  Oh.  Wow.  Did you know he was going to do that?  No.  No, he just did it?  He did it.  Were you mad at him? 
[00:21:30]  Well, brother, I have to get mad at him.  Yes.  Of course.  Soon or later, your body's going to be mine, bro.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Jimmy, is that your pickup line, too?  I love it.  I love it.  Yeah, bro.  Oh, my God.  That's how everything all started.  Our view and everything.  And, brother, we were just, like, selling out everywhere, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It was crazy.  I mean, those were, like, downtown, brother, you know? 
[00:22:00]  The big glory days right there, right?  It's amazing.  Well, you know, I got to tell you, it's great to have you.  You look fantastic.  You sound great.  I mean, like I said, we had you on here back in 2000.  Right.  And, you know, we were starting to wonder.  Yeah, we were very worried about that.  And now, I'm very happy, because I was feeling like, uh-oh, we had a dozen or so years to  what we had last time you were on, and I was thinking it might be a little depressing.  We can tell you the truth.  Look at us.  We look like shit. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Compared to you.  How did you get better looking and we get worse looking in 12 years?  What happened?  I don't know.  I like this.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm very happy that you're healthy and happy and everything.  Thank you, brother.  It's fantastic, man.  We appreciate coming up.  You're inviting me.  It's fantastic, man.  The book is called Superfly, The Jimmy Snooker Story, and you can get this, obviously, in  bookstores, and Jimmy's doing some signings.  Go to his website and find out the date.  We wish we had a sheet with the dates, how I'd read them, but we don't.  So go to the website and go and meet Jimmy Snooker, a really nice guy. 
[00:23:00]  Absolutely.  You know, I figured you'd be in.  I never met you, but you're a very nice man.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Thank you, bro.  Now you get the hell out of here.  Yeah.  Right now.  Are we done?  Thanks, man.  I believe we're done, right?  Are we doing line of the day, or we don't have to today?  Yeah, you'll do line of the day.  Do it on your damn show.  My show is next.  The Jim Norton show is next.  Oh, no.  Jimmy's today.  Jimmy, continue listening for Jimmy's show.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot it's Wednesday.  Yes.  Hey, you can do this, Sam.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker's a pleasure, sir.  Fuck.  I'll do it. 
[00:23:30]  Real Jimmy Snooker on the Twitter.  What am I doing?  Oh, okay.  Here you go.  You want to have Superfly do it?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Why?  What?  Yeah.  Do you need some reading glasses?  Yeah.  Let's do this, bro.  Got it?  Because I can't read anyway, bro.  Oh, crap.  Okay.  It's reading glasses.  Give it a try.  Give it a try.  It's in the first chapter.  What?  Jimmy has difficulty reading.  Yeah.  You can't read?  No.  I knew that.  That's why I didn't want to hand him a goddamn read.  Are you dyslexic?  Have you ever?  Because a lot of people who are dyslexic have a hard time reading.  I'm Superfly. 
[00:24:00]  Or have you never read?  No, bro.  I mean, like, I didn't even go to school.  Holy shit.  It was cliff diving, for the love of God.  Yeah, I mean, I went to school, but cliff diving all day.  You know?  Yeah.  I was always in the jungle every time, you know?  Holy smoke.  Yeah, bro.  I mean, my life was different, bro.  I always liked to be alone in the jungle there with the animals.  To become a star like that?  In the jungle.  The hell of a story.  I can't wait to read this book.  In the jungle.  That's crazy.  You're like, when you wear that headband and stuff,  that's like the real deal. 
[00:24:30]  You were out there in the jungle.  You are Tarzan.  Wrestling animals first, probably, right?  I love it.  I love it.  Get a goddamn, get a tiger and a figure four.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some real Tarzan shit.  Right.  Make them give up, brother.  Shit.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I love it.  I love it.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Anthony.  This is a Superfly, Jimmy Snooker, and you, uh...  Okay, let me start.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  This is Superfly, Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Uh, you want to say anything?  Hey, this is Jimmy, Superfly, Snooker.  One more time, and I'll edit that in.  This is Superfly, Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Superfly, Jimmy Snooker, on your radio doll.  Excellent, boss.  Thanks, man.  Okay, brother.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:25:30]  Sirius XM.  Very happy.  Today is Terry Clifford Day.  No way.  Today?  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, nice.  Which means I will not be able to call Brother Weas for at least a month.  Yeah, he, uh...  He begged me.  He goes, look.  The last time I saw him, he was like, please, just don't do Terry Clifford.  And you're like, brah, you know I gotta.  Yeah, I did say brah, I gotta.  Most of the...  He's in the same town as her.  They're in the same circles, because it's a small radio market, you know, as far as the 
[00:26:00]  shows and all that.  She really doesn't do much on the Bee Morning Coffee Club.  There's already a link flying past me.  Oh, no.  It's just, they don't waste any time.  She doesn't do that much, so most of this Jocktober is focused around one story that  they just went on for hours about.  Yeah.  It's, uh, what is it called?  Today's Country?  W-B-E-E?  It's, uh, W-B-E-E, 92.5, Today's Country, out of Rochester, New York. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-huh.  Rochester.  All right.  Here's Today's Jocktober.  I just received word from the new president of the Livingston County Farm Bureau.  sent me a note saying that, uh, he's got a lot of feedback.  I did a great speech last night, so in your faces.  Oh, good for you.  Oh.  Yeah, that makes me very happy.  As well it should.  And you know what that means?  You'll be doing another one a year from now.  Yeah, that's fine with me, man.  They were great people last night.  I had a really good time. 
[00:27:00]  And I ate about eight pounds of prime rib.  Hey.  Hey.  Awesome.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  What was that about?  The guy gave a speech and they liked it.  That was doldrums.  That was really bad.  Yeah.  Oh, I'll be awesome.  Damn.  She thought the ribs were awesome.  Oh, my God.  You got to eat a bunch of ribs and she was like, awesome.  Was that on the radio?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That sounded like it would be something you would just say before the mics went on.  No, right in the morning. 
[00:27:30]  That who gives a shit stuff.  There's some other Facebook is getting a lot of weird photos on it.  What do you mean?  Like what?  Well, there's one guy with a vacuum cleaner hose attachment.  Well, he's trying to make his dick bigger.  Yeah, he's got the shaft of his dick sucking into the vacuum hose.  Well, how else do you fucking stretch it out there?  It's a picture of a small one.  Keep the cop photobombing in a photo frame.  All right.  Nice.  A Jocktober approved banner with my face.  A girl holding up a sign that says E-Rock.  Ah. 
[00:28:00]  And making a face.  Oh, there's a cartoon picture of a house with a tree on top of it.  But the tree is growing out of the roof.  Right.  It's like there's a tree on their house.  I got a tree on my house.  See?  A tree on a house.  I got a tree on my house.  That's disgusting.  Another photo on WBEE Rochester Facebook page.  And this is two women making out, but there's shit between their mouths.  Yeah, there's two Asian women, and they're totally making out, but there's shit just squeezing  out from between the lips.  Of course, the classic Game of Thrones guy with a brace yourselves. 
[00:28:30]  Jocktober is coming.  Right.  Yes.  A robot with tank legs and a penis for a nose.  Why?  Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  I don't know, but I don't like it.  Chopped me coming out of a vagina.  Yeah, it's bad.  Ronald Reagan Dice.  Ronald Reagan Dice.  What the fuck?  Ronald Reagan Dice.  Yes.  That's a good one.  Chip Chibberson.  Jellier Jam, You Decide.  Well, we're still trying to figure that one out.  Sure.  Elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.  Oh, boy.  Happy Jocktober with a dark brown Indian-looking gentleman with a swastika t-shirt. 
[00:29:00]  Bob Kelly is a baby.  Coke float in my cup.  Very good.  A lot of stuff going on on Facebook.  We don't realize we share the same listeners.  Very strange.  Some crossover.  Well, Terry Clifford tells a story about getting confronted in the makeup aisle.  It's going to be gold.  Yeah.  The nerve of some people.  I have to say that I was stunned.  I was in the makeup aisle yesterday looking for...  I was stunned. 
[00:29:30]  I was stunned.  I got to say I was stunned.  As she was telling this story, she is a beast, right?  Yeah.  She's a very fat woman.  I had to take my headphones off and ask Travis if Terry Clifford was doing the show just for me.  I realized the story she was telling.  Well, shouldn't the people in the store be stunned that she was in the makeup aisle?  Yeah, really.  That she could fit in the aisle.  Right.  The nerve of some people.  I have to say that I was stunned.  I was in the makeup aisle yesterday looking for a couple things. 
[00:30:00]  And a woman came up to me.  And she was pretty heavily made up herself.  And she was older than I was.  And she says to me, you know, hon, if I were you, you need something to clearly define those eyebrows of yours.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe it?  What the fuck is...  I thought she was going to tell her to get a face transplant.  I've come a long way with that lately. 
[00:30:30]  Let's see what's going on in this Facebook wall.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, I didn't even know.  This must be a WBEE ad campaign.  Okay.  Because it's a man with a sheep.  Saying, baby, can we do it in the pooper?  WBEE.  There's a picture of a dolphin with Hitler's head.  And it says, hey, look.  Adolphin.  Adolphin.  Adolphin.  Adolph.  Clump Joe to Kenny dressed as a disco man.  Well, that would be John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever.  Hey, it's a woman.  A woman and a horse having sex. 
[00:31:00]  A woman having sex with a horse.  That's great.  A woman having sex with a clown.  Wow.  There's a Troy on my house.  There's a Troy on my house.  And it's Troy Kwan's head on the roof of a house.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  There's a Troy on my house.  It's Anthony with a Nazi field hockey team.  Oh, no.  They're ice hockey.  No, that's a female ice hockey team.  Yes.  But Nazi.  Oh, yeah.  That's a real picture.  A woman with a black penis. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, that's nice.  On her lips.  In her mouth.  I love you to do that.  Oh, it's a great party.  A great party.  I got shit on my radio.  A Scott Shannon quote.  Yeah.  Opie saying, good luck, bro, pointing a pistol towards the onlooker.  Oh, this was last year's thing.  It's Jocktober, but it's everybody with jocks.  There's me eating out Jim Norton's ass.  Amazing.  Opie smelling a jockstrap and touching himself.  E-Rock, very fat. 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  And Anthony, yours.  I'm just nude.  Your penis doesn't fit the jockstrap.  No, no.  The cup is dangling off the head of my immense pecker.  Off the tip.  Yes.  But the thing is, this is all on the Facebook page of WBBE.  That's weird, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do they allow that from their listeners?  Let's go back to the clip we were playing.  Ron, there's a...  Terry Clifford's in the makeup aisle.  It's E-Rock's head on a fat woman's body eating some food that says Real Florida BBQ.  Florida BBQ.  BBQ. 
[00:32:30]  You know, hon, if I were you, you need something to clearly define those eyebrows of yours.  First of all, I'd let them fill in a little bit.  They're way too thin.  And then I would paint...  At least something on you is.  There's a Troy on my ass.  And fill in a little bit.  They're way too thin.  Yeah.  And then I would paint the remainder of them in.  You...  And she used this...  She used this phrase. 
[00:33:00]  For such a full face, you need harsher eyebrows.  Now, I've got a problem with two ends of that sentence.  Don't tell me my face is full.  Oh.  Well, it's your stomach?  Yeah.  He's got a full face.  Face is full.  It is full.  You know what they were trying to say?  You have a full face.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  That's way more polite than a lot of these photos.  And more...  I mean, there's a Troy on my house. 
[00:33:30]  It's been posted many times.  Well, it's a good one.  The Clubasaurus Kenny.  Clubasaurus Kenny.  It's a black woman.  It's Kenny's head on a Brontosaurus body.  It fits.  It looks good.  It's a picture of Troy when he was in that band.  Oh.  All gangsta.  Roland with the Energizer bunny ears on that says, don't get the panda angry.  Oh, God.  Two erect penises touching each other.  One is a little smaller than the other one.  Yeah.  The other one's kind of bigger. 
[00:34:00]  If you're going to touch penis heads...  You want to make sure they're the same.  You got to make sure they're the same size, right?  Back to Jocktober.  W-B-E-E in Rochester, New York.  The B-Morning Coffee Club with Steve Newman and Terry Clifford.  Terry talks about how stunned she was.  Same story?  Same story.  With the full face?  With the full face.  In the makeup aisle?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Now, was this like a Wegmans employee?  No.  Were they featuring makeup or something?  Are you kidding? 
[00:34:30]  They can't feature anything in that store.  It's so crowded.  Good grief.  It was just a random shopper unsolicitedly started to throw her two cents.  Oh, my God.  It was her to makeover.  I was stunned.  I was, first of all...  She sounds fat.  How are you stunned by that?  She just sounds fat.  Huh?  Her voice sounds fat.  Doesn't it?  She's got a fat-sounding voice.  Yeah, of course.  You know what's more stunning than that scenario?  Huh?  A rhino projectile shitting on their Facebook page.  Now, there you go. 
[00:35:00]  Now, I'm stunned.  That's great.  If you're a big gal, how are you stunned that someone references your full face?  Your full face.  How are you stunned by that?  You're lucky they said full.  Takeover.  I was stunned.  I was, first of all, I was silent.  I looked at her.  I went...  I mean, my mouth was open.  Yeah, because you're eating.  I went, well, thanks for the advice.  I didn't know what to say.  Because I wanted to say, how freaking rude.  Yeah.  But I wasn't going to say that. 
[00:35:30]  You don't think people notice your fat face?  Why?  Because I did not say that.  Why would you say that?  If she's...  How freaking rude.  I would so say that.  Someone takes a shot at you in public and you're...  Yeah.  Don't you go right back at them?  These folks are getting resourceful.  There's a picture of a very young, felt, sexy Opie with his brother in front of the Magic  Castle there in Disney World.  Holy fuck.  Where did they find that one?  I don't know, but you are looking like a million bucks. 
[00:36:00]  Where did that one come from?  Wow.  Sleeveless shirt.  No, it's not sleeveless.  They used to roll up the sleeves so I could get an even tan.  Even cooler.  Yeah.  Good point, Travis.  Even cooler.  Oh my God.  It's a horrendous photo.  That doesn't look like the Magic Kingdom Castle.  It is, though.  It is.  I went down there...  It's weird.  It's off to the side.  I went down there with my brother many years ago.  Wow.  Where the fuck did they find that picture?  Flowing blonde locks.  That was before I met Ant. 
[00:36:30]  Wow.  That long ago?  About.  Jesus.  Why don't you know why you're at Disney World?  About, I think.  This guy is at Disney World because this guy knows how much young pussy there is in Disney  That's right.  That's right, Sam.  Yeah.  You tell him.  By the way, I'm getting word that Phase 4 could be complete.  Well, we didn't even hit Phase 1 yet, so let's see.  Let me click the old reload and...  I'm hearing Phase...  We're in the process of reloading.  We go straight to Phase 4 today.  Phase 4 is complete. 
[00:37:00]  What's Phase 4 again?  Complete shutdown?  It's complete shutdown.  It went from Phase 0 to Phase 4 immediately.  No, just take the fucking pictures down.  No, nothing.  That's it.  Oh, and Terry Clifford has shut down her personal Facebook.  We didn't even get a chance to look at that one.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's a shame.  His brother, he's on vacation this week.  I hope he is.  Oh, wait.  I don't want to deal with this today. 
[00:37:30]  I clicked on Steve Hossman, who's the guy on WBE.  And under Friends, he's got two.  And one is a guy named Mark, and the other is Brother Weez.  Oh, no.  Your radio mentor, Opie.  What does he look like?  He's right there.  Not Weez.  The other guy, yeah.  I don't see any pictures.  Voice sound a little familiar, and I'm not even...  Oh.  Do you know this guy?  He's got an iPad.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He used to work...  He's trying to be a hipster.  He used to work with Weez.  What else does he have?  Yeah, he used to work with Weez. 
[00:38:00]  So did you.  Yeah.  And look what's happened.  I've actually done radio with that guy when I visit Rochester.  He used to be on Weez's show.  You like him?  Yeah, he's all right.  He's no Terry Clifford.  No.  All right, moving on.  I want to wear a wrestling knee pad.  Okay.  And I'm thinking a brooch.  A big spider brooch.  Going with the hipster bits, though.  Yeah, hipsters have to wear two really odd things.  And then they fit in.  And then no one acknowledges them. 
[00:38:30]  And then no one questions anything.  No one questions it.  You're a hipster, man.  Yeah, I probably wouldn't notice if you did that.  No, why would you?  I'm just being cool like you, everyone else.  Exactly.  Here in Williamsburg.  All right, why don't we go back to the B-Morning Coffee Club starring Terry Clifford.  Starring.  Last we left you, she was in some kind of makeup aisle in Wegmans.  In Dullsville.  And someone said that she has a full face and she should do a few things. 
[00:39:00]  Look at her picture.  And she was absolutely stunned that someone would actually reference her as having a full face.  She does have a full face.  And when you're discussing makeup, I would gather that the size and shape of your face is important.  And I've heard about these people that are so nice they will not, like, go back at you.  Yeah.  Even though that person is insulting you.  I've heard people are that nice.  Uh-huh.  Where they can control themselves.  Sure.  She said it would be rude to talk back to her.  That's rude.  After this lady said she had a full face.  Full face. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Let's see how this concludes.  And here's Boone's favorite saying, and he used it again on me last night.  You gotta stop being such a welcome mat.  Oh, and that aggravates me when he says that.  Oh.  But I just was stunned that someone would say that to someone they don't even know.  And secondly...  Why?  It's our whole job to make you look better.  Right.  So they gotta tell you...  That's what those makeup girls do.  You're an idiot.  If there's something to compliment, they will compliment you.  But if there's nothing to compliment you with, they'll go with the full fucking face thing. 
[00:40:00]  Look at her face!  Holy shit.  She has a fucking Andre the Giant face.  Her eyes are a little too far apart.  Oh, my God.  Is she the weirdest looking thing?  And she's wearing a tag that says Big Easy.  Big Easy.  That's who she is.  Oh, God.  Oh, is she terrible?  Is that a full face?  Yeah, that's a full fucking face.  You would swear that's a guy.  Yep.  You would swear.  You would go, that's a guy.  Holy fuck.  You think that's the type of remark that hurts her feelings when she talks to Brother Lee? 
[00:40:30]  Shut up.  Oh, God.  How do I do this?  I like going to Rochester.  Oh, man.  It's just a matter of time before I run into her.  I can't wait.  I didn't have to play that part where I didn't mean it and all that shit.  But you did.  You meant all of it.  Of course.  I mean every single fucking word.  Weasel will be like, Terry, this is Opie.  Oh, you.  Oh, now you.  Oh, Terry.  It's just for the radio.  You didn't mean to me.  No.  You've been.  No, no.  You have.  Tell you the truth.  Listen to the tape.  It was all Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that's it.  I've used that one before.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You got to.  That's the best part about having a radio duo.  You're able to blame the other party for everything.  Gets you out of a lot of jams.  I really had nothing to do with that one, Terry Clifford.  He's obsessed with making fun of fat people.  Right.  I try to stop him.  If you listen to the show, you'll hear.  I'm a big fan.  I kept stopping the audio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I kept.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, let's get back into Terry Clifford being stunned, amazed, all sorts of shit. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Terry Clifford.  Someone's monitoring and saying the show has not talked since this whole thing started.  Oh, boy.  Why?  Do your show.  I don't know.  They get very upset.  They go into battle mode.  They just shut down, batten down the hatches.  And secondly, my eyebrows look fine.  I get them done professionally once a month.  Why bother?  I mean, honestly, why fucking bother with.  I don't understand fatties.  It's the people like ourselves that are borderline good looking. 
[00:42:00]  You got to take care of your shit.  Yeah.  But if you're in the sub-borderline good looking category, why bother?  You're absolutely right.  Why bother?  No one's going to look and go, wow.  Her eyebrows look fine.  Her eyebrows.  I thought you were a two, but now that you got your eyebrows done, I'm going to give you  a three.  And the retard bangs ain't cutting it.  They really are just too high.  It must be helpful today.  Short.  Yeah.  We're being helpful. 
[00:42:30]  The perm.  This is helpful.  The perm is way too tight.  The perm's too tight.  Natural hair.  If it is, then grow it out.  Get those curls a little looser.  The bangs that go completely straight across your forehead, four inches above your eyes.  Way too high.  It's not happening.  Okay?  She does not have one redeeming quality.  Could someone Photoshop all our faces into her hair?  How do we do that?  Before we work on the hair too much, how about she loses two people worth of weight? 
[00:43:00]  Right.  That's the biggest thing.  It's her.  Oh, guys.  We got to have her lose some weight.  Honestly, if you don't want people to notice your full face.  Throw a neck?  No.  Get some breast implants.  Oh, she is a flatso.  Guys like looking at titties.  She's a flatso.  Show some cleavage.  They'll leave your face alone.  I don't know what to do with the linebacker back.  I always assume fat people can just open the closet and just grab anything and put it on  and not look because they don't have to worry about looking good. 
[00:43:30]  They could just put on fucking a gunny sack and go to work or something because no one's  going to look and go, oh, she fucking looks great in that.  That must be freeing.  Let's ask E-Rock.  Is that why he's wearing a skeletal shirt?  Well, it's the flow chart.  I can't help it.  I was going to say so.  I don't make the rules.  There's an E-Rock flow chart around here.  Right.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  Jesus.  The hair is just too tight. 
[00:44:00]  That's terrible.  The bangs are too high.  She does have nice eyebrows, though.  Sexy.  They are terrific.  Give her those eyebrows.  A nice arch.  A nice little arch to them.  Yeah.  Nice punching targets.  Her ears are like in her head.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got those inny ear lobes.  Where her head is just naturally trying to consume them.  Yeah.  Like a fucking sign that's too close to a tree after like 25 years.  It just starts eating the sign. 
[00:44:30]  That's what her ears, her head is eating her ears.  Yes.  There's an earring that's like getting engulfed.  That is shit.  All right.  Let's continue with this clip.  Her in the makeup aisle at Wegmans.  Secondly, my eyebrows look fine.  I get them done professionally once a month.  Well, now you said that she was a little made up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There's a guy that was almost honest.  Almost.  He's like, he wanted to say right there, you're delusional. 
[00:45:00]  He was a split second away from honesty.  Yes.  And then had a bail.  And a giant blowout.  Because the show doesn't say starring whoever this guy's name is.  It's starring Terry Clifford.  She should turn her ear.  She should twist her ear and have Arnold's head in there.  She really has a big fat head.  It's Terry Clifford's morning coffee club with the others.  With the others.  Terry Clifford is the marquee performer.  Does she dress up as the two weeks broad for Halloween? 
[00:45:30]  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Can we do the two weeks?  Fat head.  Can you find that picture?  Split screen it?  Yeah.  Very similar.  Yeah, she does have that fat head.  Well, now, you said that she was a little made up herself.  Why didn't you just come back at her and say, well, what about your look?  Well, because I don't want to be confrontational and get in a fight in the middle of the aisle at Wegmans.  She said, what tribe are you, man?  See?  Believe me, I could have come up with enough zingers, but I just... 
[00:46:00]  But you didn't, so shut up.  I hate these people.  You either do it or you don't.  Could have.  That could have shit sucks.  Oh, God.  I could have, really?  It's the same broad.  It really is.  That's the same broad.  Oh, God.  It's the same broad.  Oh, that's frightening.  See, but the two weeks broad has the longer hair.  See how it kind of softens her look a little bit?  Two weeks.  She's got a very big head.  It covers up the ears that are being swallowed by the skull.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:46:30]  She was scary.  All right.  Let's see.  We got the two weeks broad on our screen.  Now, let's...  Oh, God.  I can't...  Oh, you.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There it is.  That's good.  That works.  All right.  Come on, Sam.  That works.  Come on.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can see it.  There's some similarities there.  Definitely.  Oh, God.  Islet Wegmans.  She said, what tribe are you in?  See?  Believe me, I could have come up with enough zingers, but I just wouldn't do it. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my word.  I was stunned.  I was absolutely stunned.  And then I got so mad at myself, because I was so stunned.  I just got in the aisle, paid for my stuff, and left.  I never even bought what I was after.  So as a result today, I'm not totally made up.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  No one noticed.  Thank God you said that.  No one noticed.  No one cared that you're not made up.  Sorry.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Oldie time deep sea diving helmet plus tap shoes equals Williamsburg hipster. 
[00:47:30]  And then you just meet your friends, like, in front of one of the Asian fucking restaurants  in Williamsburg.  And you're having a great time.  Sure.  Yeah.  Sam wrote this, because I'm going to have to deal with wheeze eventually about this.  Sam writes, more on this dumb lady.  I want to get back at her on your behalf.  Actually, I want you to get back at her. 
[00:48:00]  But I shouldn't live that way.  That's not a nice way to live.  Well.  You think you could have taken her?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, duh.  Look at me.  I could have sat on her.  Ah.  You think you could have taken her?  You're saying nobody.  She could take half the fucking guys in Rochester.  Nobody notices whether she's made up or not when she has to sit on two desk chairs to broadcast  next to each other.  Get the ones with happy arms on her.  That's not a nice way to live. 
[00:48:30]  Well.  You think you could have taken her?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Would you hit her first in the stomach or go right for the jaw?  Yeah, how would you do that?  I've never considered that.  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word.  You know.  You're fantasizing.  Tell the people you'd punch her in the fucking face.  I got to tell you.  That clip made me think of something. 
[00:49:00]  That's how Fez would sound if he had a sex change.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How do you know?  Huh?  How do you know?  I don't know.  I just had a visual.  Oh, why do you say this?  If Fez had a sex change, you know what else heard that?  He had a rough day the other day.  Just the last part.  Maybe we should just.  I want to get back at her.  Hold on.  Last part, though.  Humor me.  Didn't he have a tough day the other day?  Yeah, how would you do that?  I would have never considered that.  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word. 
[00:49:30]  You hear it.  Oh, no.  You hear it.  You hear it.  Oh, no.  You hear it, though.  There's something there.  If there was some hormones introduced that would raise the voice a little, let me hear  it again.  I knew you would hear it.  I know.  I knew you would hear it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, how would you do that?  I've never considered that. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word.  I'm saying if you had a sex change, that's not going to happen, so you should be all  right with that, right?  It's a standalone fruit.  You know.  You know, it's.  I got to say, maybe I'm getting soft because now I'm a father or two.  Terry Clifford sounds like just a nice lady.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:50:30]  Was that before or?  She just sounds like a nice lady.  Was that before or after you commented on her retard bangs?  I didn't say retard bangs.  I said retard bangs.  But then Opie said we should Photoshop all our faces into her hair.  That would be a good carnival game.  That would be fun.  And then said as if it were.  Could someone do that?  And then said as if it were factual, not a joke.  Let's all be honest.  Terry Clifford looks like a man.  What's the matter?  What happens when you leave the studio?  No, no.  It's when I go to Rochester. 
[00:51:00]  I got to deal with.  Oh, okay.  So that's.  Oh, all right.  You're just covering for the next trip to Rochester.  I could just hear that she's a nice lady, though.  Is she?  Yeah, man.  Oh, I would just get her.  She allows people to basically say.  With my words.  To tell.  To point out her fatness right in front of her.  And she doesn't even.  Yeah.  Respond.  Yeah.  She is a fat lady, though.  That takes a special person.  She is a big fat lady.  I bet she does a lot for the community.  I bet she does.  And charity.  Yeah, but E-Rock works for you.  And you call it fat.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Good point. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, but E-Rock's like, you know, fat.  I bet if she.  I bet if she did Jocktober and goofed on a radio station, they could never say, well, I bet  she doesn't do anything for the community.  Right.  Right.  Because I bet she does.  A lot.  Yeah, she shopped at Wegmans.  That's doing something.  I bet she's very community active.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if she's active, but she does a lot for the community.  What do you mean?  She probably sits around a lot.  Doesn't do much.  Oh.  Active.  Yeah.  Well, you see, she's so overweight.  Well, I think she did it to herself, though. 
[00:52:00]  Why would she bring that story to the show?  That's what I was talking to Travis about.  Why on all days, the day that I'm recording you is the day that you're bringing up the  fact that somebody came up to you, a stranger came up to you and said, you have a very full  face.  Why would you do that?  Terry Clifford, learn.  Like, you're not a good-looking woman.  But you probably have other qualities that are nice.  Can you imagine what this is doing to her if she got so flustered at Wegmans that she  didn't even end up buying what she wanted?  Right. 
[00:52:30]  Just because of that one little comment?  I mean, God bless her for trying and all, but...  And then you could hear the guys.  They're like, are you really telling this story to us?  Do you think that they all know how fat she is?  Yes!  Yeah, I bet they do.  The one guy paused because he wanted to say, you're delusional.  Of course.  Of course she should say that.  Yeah, you have a full face.  It's full of cake.  It's full of roast beef.  It's full of whatever you can get your hands on.  Whatever you can shove in it.  Yeah.  She's probably trying, though.  Oh.  Oh, now. 
[00:53:00]  Listen, we've been following Terry Clifford for five years.  We've done five?  Yes.  She was there for the first of October.  Wow.  And?  She's been fat ever since.  Yeah.  The Twitter's now down.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened?  And supposedly they haven't gone live in ten minutes.  Oh.  She's probably crying.  You made her cry, Opie?  I hope not.  Last time she cried.  There were tears, right?  And then she'd have to wipe her tears and go back on the air and do that show. 
[00:53:30]  Because that's the kind of professional she is.  Wait, she said that?  Right?  I think that was another person who said that.  Oh, I thought it was her.  No.  Oh, well then, fuck it.  Oh.  Just another casualty left in the wake of Jocktober.  Yeah.  Let's take a look.  Hang on.  But if we've done it five years in a row, she must know it's coming.  She's the queen of Jocktober.  Put it on your calendar.  She thought maybe this time she had made it through.  Because it was kind of late in October.  We only got another week and a half.  And plus, Opie had been, you know, she knew. 
[00:54:00]  She talked to Weez and said, hey, tell your boy.  Weez was campaigning for her hard, man.  In the middle of the summer, by the way, I'm up in Rochester having a good time.  And she goes, hey, brah.  Terry Clifford's a really nice lady, brah.  I see her all the time at Wigman's.  We go to the same restaurants, brah.  He sees her in Wigman's?  All that shit.  He goes, please.  I'm like, he's the one who said it.  I go, I don't even know.  I go, that's months away.  I don't even know what we're going to do this year.  Relax.  Did he say she had a full face?  Is he the one?  Oh, no.  He never said it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  Jocktober 2012 is the Twitter name for this person.  Oh.  It's got a picture of you guys, but I don't think you have anything to do with it.  Uh-huh.  Because this person on Twitter just wrote,  at Terry WBEE is a fat cunt who should die of AIDS.  Oh, Jesus.  Of the cancer of the AIDS.  Which is just like.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  So, I mean, die of AIDS of the cancer of the AIDS is just such a terrible way to go.  What does that even mean? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, man.  Why would you even read that one?  I know.  That's really bad.  And I'm not even saying that so you read more.  I'm like, why would you read that one?  Just to tell you what's going on.  I had to shut down my Facebook wall.  Hashtag fat lady tweets.  Come on.  Terry Schiavo, greater sign, Terry WBEE.  But she got that big check for all the bullying, right?  Terry Clifford?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I think.  What?  No.  I'll be here confused. 
[00:55:30]  That was Rochester?  That was her.  That was Terry.  What?  That was a bus monitor.  That was a large, dumb, fat woman.  Oh, shit.  I thought it was the same person.  Yeah, no.  That wasn't.  Oh, I thought like.  The kids weren't making fun of her?  I thought in the end she did well because she got the big check.  Yeah, no.  That wasn't her.  That was her.  Oh, look.  She has pictures where she's doing all this nice stuff.  Doing good stuff for the community.  Oh, she went to.  Like we don't do, ever.  She went to Goodwill.  You don't care about the community.  We don't care about the community.  At all.  Oh, not in the least.  She's as big as those two people together. 
[00:56:00]  So big.  And those two people are fat.  Yeah.  They're also flat-sos.  And she wears sensible clothes.  She just wants to wake up.  She wakes up happy in the morning.  In a good mood.  Ready to put on a good show.  With her Andre the Giant hair.  She dresses like someone working in a hardware store.  Just trying to find out if anybody wants a peanut.  She's terrible.  Pulling up to the studio with four white horses.  Yeah.  Are we done?  I think we're done. 
[00:56:30]  This was uncomfortable, this one.  Well, for you.  I didn't feel good about this one.  Yeah.  Blame it on the show.  You shouldn't.  Blame it on the rest of the show.  It's just the show, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  I used to do meme prank calls.  Me and my buddy Tyler.  I would just call Indian people out of the phone book.  Oh, no.  But this is way before Star 69. 
[00:57:00]  And I would just go like...  I remember some guy's name was something Patel.  And I'd be like, hey, is this Mr. Patel?  Yeah.  I'm going to get you, boy.  I said, I'm going to kill you.  Get out of town.  He would go, who is this?  Who's calling me?  And he would know I had his name from the phone book.  So I'd say his name.  I'm going, we don't need you around here.  I'm going to kill you.  It was like these things that could get you in so much trouble.  It's horrible.  Those are like threats based on race and things like that.  I was really high and drunk one time. 
[00:57:30]  And I made a prank called my school and said there was a bomb somewhere.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  It's not a prank.  That's a bomb threat.  That's a bomb threat.  Yeah.  When does a prank become a bomb threat?  But I may have said something like, and if you think this is a joke, then start laughing  and hung up while me and my stoned friends were around giggling and I heard they evacuated  the school.  What's the statute of limitations on that?  That's like 1985.  Yeah, I think you're all right.  And by the way, if you think this is a joke, then start laughing.  Yeah, that was the line.  That's what a crazy person would say. 
[00:58:00]  No, it doesn't mean anything.  No.  Like, instead of acting, laugh.  If you think that's a joke, start laughing.  I used to call all these fucking, we would go to my buddy Scott's house and I would get  fucked up.  And I used to call, like, these, like, these, like, nuns that would help, like, wayward  runaways, and I would just always talk about being raped, and I was getting, like, raped  and stuff, so I needed help.  But my prank calls weren't clever or funny, they were just disgusting and mean.  Yeah.  Aw.  Hi.  That's hilarious. 
[00:58:30]  Hello?  I'm gonna kill you.  Click.  He's just threats.  Yeah, I was just a jerk.  You are a jerk.  By the time I called the bomb threat to the White House from the library.  What?  I was probably 12, 13 years old from the North Brunswick Public Library.  I might not have got through to the White House.  I think I just called the operator and I told her to put me through to the White House.  Because I was gonna bomb us or something.  That's hilarious.  I was young.  I didn't know it was bad. 
[00:59:00]  I thought it'd be a big laugh.  Oh, Jimmy.  What the hell was your thought process then?  I don't know.  Weren't even any jokes.  You were just calling up and threatening people.  Yeah.  Threatening their lives.  I wish I could remember all of them.  They were not clever.  Can you imagine what the operator thought when a 12-year-old kid is asking to be transferred  to the White House?  Give me the White House.  Come on.  Yeah, from the North Brunswick Public Library.  Fucking dork city.  I was simple with the prank calls.  Like, just, you know, call up random numbers. 
[00:59:30]  A lot of random.  When you didn't have to, you know, there was a time.  And let me tell you a little more about history, young Sam.  There was a time where if you were calling a number in the same area code as yourself,  you did not have to dial the area code.  Really?  So if I'm calling a friend, I would just dial, you know, 261-5437, something like that,  instead of putting the area code in front.  Well, I mean, now it's just you just click the name. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, right.  No one even has phone numbers anymore.  This is true.  You just click the name in your phone book.  You just click the name in your phone.  Right.  But you used to have to, actually, yeah, you didn't have to dial in that.  So you could dial random calls very quickly for prank phone calls.  You could just dial seven numbers.  Right.  You'd use the first three from your neighborhood or some friend's neighborhood or something  like that nearby, and then you'd just dial random four numbers.  And somebody would answer.  Yeah.  But if you wanted to get creative, then you would look in the phone book, because then 
[01:00:30]  you'd have the name and be able to, like you said, you know, you have his name.  Hello, Mrs. Johnson.  Why, yeah.  That's me.  Now you could get a little personal.  When I was a freshman in college, me and my buddy.  My buddy and I.  Oh, you're right.  Oh.  My buddy and I sat in my dorm room looking up people in the college directory with sitcom  last names.  Oh, shit.  And calling and asking for sitcom characters.  That's hilarious.  And my phone ran out of battery, so he started using his phone. 
[01:01:00]  And then somebody filed a harassment charge against him on his phone.  Because, obviously, it's like 2002, people will call our ID.  Oh.  He got in so much trouble.  I didn't take any blame.  The harassment charges?  Yeah, because you can't, you know, you can't look up the name Winslow and then call them  up with a black woman's voice and say, you're Harriet.  Where's Carl?  That's pretty good.  You know?  That's a good one. 
[01:01:30]  So.  Yeah, there was no Star 69.  People, like, back then would have to just hope that you stopped calling.  Remember heavy breathing?  People would call you and just breathe.  Ah, fuck you.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, fuck you.  That's so hopeless.  They would, the way you just said that, you just have to hope that they stopped calling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really hope this person stops pranking.  Change your number.  I'll take it off the hook for a while.  I'll take the phone off the hook.  And then you'd do that, you'd have to get past the point where the dial tone, and then 
[01:02:00]  it would go, and then it would just go silent after a while.  But then you couldn't get phone calls from anyone else.  No, because there was no call waiting or anything.  No.  Nothing worse than, like, trying to call someone in a busy signal.  Remember a busy signal that would be, like, for an hour?  Yeah, yeah.  An hour and a half and you're like, oh, the guy's mom's on the phone.  An emergency breakthrough?  Do you remember emergency breakthroughs?  High operator, could you do an emergency breakthrough?  You'd call for an emergency breakthrough.  And the operator would say, so-and-so wants an emergency breakthrough. 
[01:02:30]  It's like, who's on the fucking phone that long?  With the very beginning of, like, AOL, you used to call people's house and it'd be busy  for hours because they were on the internet.  Right.  Yeah.  14K.  I'm not talking about that.  No, this is way before, Sam.  I wasn't alive.  Moms used to spend so much time on the phone.  People's, like, my mom, I know my friend's moms, they were constantly on the phone for  hours on end.  Just jabbering like broads.  Exactly.  Fucking jabbering broads talking about nothing.  I knew it was going to be, like, I wasn't going to be able to use, and you weren't able 
[01:03:00]  to use the phone.  Like, if mom was on the phone, you had no contact with your friends, you didn't know  what was going on.  So it sucked when, you know, the phone would ring and my mom would pick it up and be like,  hello?  Hey, how the hell are ya?  I'm like, oh, fuck.  This is going to be hours for a how the hell are ya.  And they didn't want anything.  It was just a long conversation.  They just would talk.  Now you only make a phone call if you have the specific purpose to, like, I need you  to do something, or, you know, you needed me to do something. 
[01:03:30]  Never just for conversation.  My friend Richie Jones used to call me every day in fourth grade, except he never wanted  anything.  What a moe.  And I would always be like, okay, I got to go.  And he'd be like, why do you have to go?  Ew, he's a fucking couple.  What a needy guy.  I just don't want to be on the phone anymore.  Oh, he's needy.  Yeah.  My mom didn't let me go to his house because he lived in a low income, you know.  He was from lower stock area.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I miss you, too.  I would talk to a couple of my buddies growing up, and you just spent hours on the phone. 
[01:04:00]  Like, it wasn't girlfriends.  It was just you and your buddy yakking about nothing.  Just talk about nothing.  Falling asleep chatting.  You fell asleep chatting with your guy friends?  Just buddies, yeah.  He's talking to your friends.  Oh, my God.  Very gay.  Is it gay?  That's very gay.  That is kind of gay.  We're just talkative.  Falling asleep with your buddy.  But it wasn't a love thing.  Whispering sweet nothings in your ear.  No, no, no, no.  That's very, very gay.  So you're in bed now?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you wearing?  Do you wear pajamas?  No, it wasn't that.  Touch yourself.  It wasn't that type of talk.  Touch yourself. 
[01:04:30]  Can I tell you something, Jim?  Yeah.  I don't wear anything when I sleep.  No, we never had that.  I'm naked right now, Jimmy.  I'm naked, Jimmy.  I'm going to fall asleep.  Yeah.  Although we're saying...  Are you asleep yet?  We're saying the guy...  Jim is gay for talking to his friends and falling asleep.  This is the same guy who was blowing his friends when he was seven.  But I'm denying...  No, it's not.  It's right.  Very manly.  I got in big trouble once with a girlfriend.  Oh.  Richard?  Yes, Richard.  Richard Schepanski. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I was having a tiff with a girlfriend.  And back then, especially, boy, Anthony never got in tiffs with the girlfriends.  It was always girlfriend mad, Anthony crying, please stop, and apologizing to girls.  Really?  You were still in the crying phase.  Well, no, I wasn't really crying, but I was very sad.  Yeah.  I would never really get into it with a girlfriend, like yelling or even...  Like, I would be like, yes, I'm wrong, please love me. 
[01:05:30]  Because you wanted her to be liked so bad, you were afraid if you fought back, she wouldn't  like you anymore.  She was going to fucking ditch me and fuck my friends.  Oh, no.  That sounds terrible.  Which, to me, was like a fucking sentence worse than death.  The old girlfriend fucking your friends thing.  So, we were discussing this on the phone, and I was laying down on the bed, talking on  the phone, and we were having a very in-depth discussion.  And the next thing I remember, I woke up to a silent phone, like, hours later. 
[01:06:00]  And I'm like, oh, no.  She's going to hate me.  And then I just, I didn't know.  I woke up at first, like, I didn't know what was going on.  And I'm like, what?  Wait a minute.  I was, was I on the phone or something?  Oh, my God!  No!  We were talking!  Oh, shit!  I didn't finish the conversation!  She must have...  And I'm just picturing her going, hello?  Hello?  Like, I played the silent game with her.  And back then, you can't, you have to wait until the next day for closure. 
[01:06:30]  It was pretty much...  Well, I had...  No, you can't just text her.  Sorry.  I had to call her back.  Wasn't it late?  It wasn't that late.  Oh, okay.  But, yeah, it was like...  It was like 8 o'clock.  She was so mad.  She was yelling at me that I...  How dare I fall asleep in the middle of such an important conversation?  Oh, was she pissed.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, sweetie.  I'm sorry.  Were you always like the groveling apologizing? 
[01:07:00]  Yes!  Did it work out?  No!  She fucked my friend.  I swear.  Fucking cunt.  She fucking went off with Frank.  I'll never fall asleep on the phone with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, you fucker.  Justin Stengel just texted me and said when he was in high school, a heavy breather called  and his mom answered.  Oh.  And his dad was traveling, so his mom thought it was his dad just messing around, and she  was talking to him for five minutes while he was jerking off. 
[01:07:30]  And then she remembered his dad was on the plane, so she hung up immediately.  Holy shit.  So she's just talking to him.  He's jerking off.  And she's like, oh, shit, his plane hasn't landed.  Oh, that's correct.  Let me break Justin's fucking bubble.  What happened was his mother was having phone sex, and when Justin walked in and said,  Mommy, who are you talking to?  Oh, it's your father.  She built that excuse.  Yes.  What she was doing was, she probably was standing by the counter, and she had a fucking roller, 
[01:08:00]  and as she was talking, she was probably grinding her cunt into the roller.  Oh, my God.  No, I mean, with pants on.  No, I'll do respect you.  I love Justin.  She was probably grinding her crotch, I should say, into the end of the fucking, what do  you call it?  Is that what you call it?  The roller?  The rolling pin.  She was just grinding her fucking clit and groin, talking to this stranger.  Because her favorite book was, A Stranger Calls Me.  She would read it, and she had it dog-eared for all the sexy parts. 
[01:08:30]  Ooh, I'm reading A Stranger Calls Me.  And then she would rub kitchen utensils on herself?  On her vagina, yeah.  You think they used the rolling pin women?  Yeah, or the ice cream scooper.  Like, if she was at the table, she would probably use the bottom side of the ice cream scooper  over her slacks.  I didn't know that.  All the Stangles were eating soup.  I'm sorry, Justin.  The whole Stangle family.  Yeah, they had no idea.  Like, where's the ice cream scooper?  And then Mom would sheepishly pull it off from under the table.  We want dessert. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I bet a woman wearing tight pants would like a nice whisk.  You take the whisk and just, in your lap.  Like you're whisking eggs.  Just scramble them.  Whip it up some butter.  Yes.  And you hand it to your boy, and he licks the beaters.  Licks the egg beaters.  There's a fucking hair on it.  And leg sweat.  Like a thick meringue.  Ooh, that's wonderful.  You never want to think about your mom talking to a guy through a jerk. 
[01:09:30]  No.  She was fucking talking to a guy through a jerk.  She was jacking off.  Oh, no.  Yeah, anything.  It was very difficult to get a good jerk in when you lived at home like that.  Not just because it was hard to get time alone, but you never wanted to equate what you were  doing with the rest of your family, you know?  Like, because it was always like, oh, Mom's got to do my laundry.  So, you know, where's the jizz going?  It's going in the sheet or somewhere. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  Or you're jerking off in your room and, like, she's got to go in there and clean.  It's just a weird situation with that.  And then I used to steal her Cosmo magazines.  I used to steal her Cosmo to jack off to it.  They had a Cosmo Tells All in the back, and it was always a nude shot.  Really?  Yeah, some nude picture.  Some of them were kind of, like, blurry, but other ones were like, yeah, it's a nude shot.  Do you miss the days when you could just jerk off to a naked lady in Cosmo?  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  How nice of that.  Yes.  We were so less desensitized back then.  Oh, you could just fucking, anything, anything would be fucking stiff as a board right there.  Any picture.  Oh.  Even reading Penthouse Forum.  Oh.  Just reading Penthouse Forum.  Imagining it in your mind.  Now you need fucking three people, a donkey.  Yeah.  What kinds of shit going on?  It's terrible.  When I used to steal magazines, whether it was Wii or Penthouse, Playboy was always corny. 
[01:11:00]  But I would steal them out of the fucking machine, the vending machine.  Wii was good.  But a good ass shot would make me fucking crazy.  I could come to that in a second.  Yes.  And then now you just get older and get jaded and it doesn't do it anymore.  You've just seen so much shit.  To jack off to something, boy, do you need a virtual three-ring circus of porno.  Yeah.  It's not exactly a treat to find something now.  No, you've got to have a fucking computer keyboard set up like Emerson Lake and Palmer all around you. 
[01:11:30]  You're fucking working the mouse, the fucking touchpad, you dick.  You're just trying to find something.  No, I'm going to come to that.  Wait, no, I'll get something better.  I know there's something better just around the corner.  Five hours later, you're still edging.  Penthouse Forum just looks like a blog now.  Like you can just read everything.  It's hard to, you know, no one's going to go out and buy that when there's so much.  Penthouse Forum, George.  You can go to like these big sites now that are these super sites of stories. 
[01:12:00]  I'll take the sites.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to jerk off and I forgot I got the soup and everything.  Yeah.  Being able to read something like that, like Penthouse Forum was fucking hot.  Yeah.  When I was younger and would read that.  Great.  Great shit.  I love that.  They're all real.  Turned my pod to it.  No.  Yeah, no.  All these stories are real.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I mean, nobody's going to write them in if they're not.  Yeah.  True.  But the worst was when you get a magazine fiction. 
[01:12:30]  An issue that had no good stuff in it.  No.  Sometimes you would just get one and there was nothing good.  Like no good seduction stories.  Yeah.  I like the good seduction story.  You'd need like, yeah, like some, some, oh, what is this?  Yeah.  Oh, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Oh, I never liked the bondage ones.  They stink.  Yeah.  She parted her legs and I could see her underpants.  Not a fan of the bondage.  Even now? 
[01:13:00]  No.  Bondage stories do nothing for me.  I don't get it.  Not bad.  Unexpected encounters.  What?  I don't get it, the bondage.  Like I, I, there's some people like the idea of the tying and tickling is a weird one that  does nothing for me.  Tickling?  Oh yeah.  Tickling's a big fetish.  What does that?  Must be the helplessness.  Sounds stupid.  Can I ask if anybody out there would call in that has experienced a tickling fetish?  And don't just heavy breathe on the phone.  We want to talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I'm serious.  Tickling's funny.  Some people like it.  I don't get it.  It's not sexy. 
[01:13:30]  I've seen it in video a little bit.  I don't think I've ever known anybody who was into it, but I've just, it's just weird  to me.  Dr. Steve checking in.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I used to beat off to Betty and Veronica in the Archie comics if nothing else was around.  Ha ha.  Yuck.  So much for the good old days.  Yeah.  Now he's, now it's fucking, he's lying.  It was probably, he wanted to be in a threesome with Jughead and Big Ethel.  Like he would dream that Jughead would make, would make him wear the crown while he sucked 
[01:14:00]  Jughead's cock and Big Ethel fucked him with a strap on.  And then they could hear the Archie's band rehearsal through the wall.  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah-yah.  Ah-yah.  Yeah.  It's good to me.  Where's Mr. Lodge?  I have a fetish for older gentlemen.  I want Mr. Lodge to come in my face.  He wanted Mr. Lodge.  He wanted Mr. Lodge to fuck his shitter.  He says, thank God for the internet.  Yes.  The internet changed everything.  When we used to watch those, you old enough, Sam, to remember the scrolling pictures? 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Uh, where you get AOL and, uh, bing, you've got mail.  Yeah.  They're like, ooh, someone sent me one.  And, uh, you download it.  It would take forever to download one picture.  I used to go into chat rooms and try to trade with people, but I wouldn't have anything,  so I would just rip them off all the time.  I did that too.  You would do it, right?  You sent first.  Okay, sent at the same time.  Fucking asshole.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Do those chat rooms exist anymore in AOL or no?  Not really.  Are there AOL chat rooms?  Who would fucking go there? 
[01:15:00]  AOL was like internet training wheels.  That's what it was.  It was like, let's get everyone kind of into this to know what it's all about.  And then, after a while, you realize, wait a minute.  If I'm hooked up to the internet, I can go and browse websites by myself?  Nobody knew what a browser was.  I don't need to stay in AOL?  I forget.  I was looking at something.  It might have been like a movie cover.  I don't remember what it was, but it had the old AOL keyword dot member.  Before anybody had a website, all the big companies had an AOL keyword. 
[01:15:30]  AOL keyword.  Yeah.  AOL keyword.  Because they all had Sony.  They all had AOL pages because you used to have to click through the AOL pages.  Yes.  And I remember when I first started coming on the show, I would go to AOL profiles and stuff.  Yeah.  And I would search Opie and Anthony.  And whoever had a girl that had Opie and Anthony in her profile, I would try to talk to.  Oh, man.  Hi, I'm Desperate Jim.  Oh, that's hilarious.  What a great way to get some chicks.  I don't know if I ever... 
[01:16:00]  Did you ever score?  No?  But look at how, in that last 10 years, how fucking different it is, man.  It's amazing.  I really don't watch my TV anymore.  I never thought that I...  If the iPad didn't have such cocksucker, typical pussy Mac volume, I would watch the  iPad.  I watch all, like, the whole fucking Boardwalk Empire watch on the iPad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could absolutely do that.  Looks great.  You pop in your earphones, Jimmy.  It's not even loud.  Really?  On a plane, Mac volume is so shitty with the iPad.  Even on a plane, when I have Bose earphones and I can't hear it because of the engine noise. 
[01:16:30]  It can't compete with the jet engine.  Yeah.  It's annoying to me that they do that.  Yeah.  They want you to buy external speakers.  Yeah, absolutely.  I used to go to the, uh, go to AOL, uh, go in those rooms, um, and trade shit on, like,  my brother's computer.  It's like, fuck him, let him get in trouble.  I was, I was 12.  Oh.  So I used to...  You could have taken pictures of yourself and just sent them.  I would, now I know I could have made money.  But, no, I used to be kicked off AOL all the time and they would call my dad because I always 
[01:17:00]  got terms of service warnings for pretending to be wrestlers.  What a jerk walk.  Oh, my God.  You have the worst rebel stories.  I know.  That's terrible.  Who would you try to be?  Goldust.  Were you ever Bob Backlund?  No.  And you were doing the knee walk around the AOL chat room?  No, I'd pretend I was Goldust.  What would you do?  Because my screen name was GDust1.  And my profile, I filled out my profile and it said, like, name, Dustin. 
[01:17:30]  And I filled it out with, like, just things that, alluding to me being Goldust.  Oh, my God.  How did they find out?  Well, the minute that you say that you are him, somebody can just copy the conversation  and send it to terms of service.  Why would they do that, though?  Who cares?  They always, I always got busted.  It's a bunch of rats running around there, huh?  They would actually call, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got kicked off AOL twice.  I think I had two strikes.  Wow.  Because they're pretending to be Goldust.  Not for downloading porn.  No, no.  What would you say is Goldust, though? 
[01:18:00]  I would just be, I would keep answering things.  Like, they'd be like, are you really Goldust?  Maybe.  Why do you ask?  Oh, God.  And then eventually I'd be like, yes, I am.  Yeah, I am.  Do you really hate Razor Ramon?  Yeah, I can't stand the guy and blah, blah, blah.  You're really gay?  I am.  Yeah, I'm gay.  I'm the gayest.  Sam's an idiot.  Embarrassing.  So are you looking at chat rooms?  They were the rooms that used to just say, like, GIFs, and you'd go in there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, that's the way you traded.  Yeah, you can still do chat rooms.  You've got to download AIM, and I guess people are still on AIM. 
[01:18:30]  I have AIM.  That's crazy.  I'm sure I have one, too.  I mean, I would have to remember my...  I don't really use it, but I have it.  Do people still on AOL?  I have an AOL account.  I still have Yellow Treats, but I don't use it anymore.  You do?  Because I have some emails from years ago that I saved, but I've got to go back through.  I'm going to dump my AOL, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're cocksuckers.  I got hacked, and they wouldn't help me unhack until I paid for the service, because it was  free.  Wow.  They're such scumbags.  AOL are scumbags.  I'm really glad that they're going to be...  Isn't it free now? 
[01:19:00]  I mean, obviously, you don't pay for it.  It has to be.  They're not doing anything.  There's no reason to.  I remember people like, wait a minute, what do you want, AOL?  I go, no, I just have Roadrunner service, you know, high-speed internet.  It's hooked up all the time.  You don't even have to dial up.  What?  What?  He goes, but how do you, like, see stuff without AOL?  I go, no, you just got to pop open a browser.  You pop open Netscape.  Oh, what?  Netscrape.  And it's great.  What?  But then where does it go?  How do you get your mail? 
[01:19:30]  What do you do?  It was weird when you left the fucking AOL compound.  But then you had to get, like, Hotmail or Yahoo mail.  Yeah.  I had ExciteMail.  I got Yahoo.  Is Hotmail still used?  It is, right?  Yeah, a lot of people still use Hotmail for some reason.  Is it still big?  Yeah.  Gmail's big, though.  Gmail's the best.  Gmail's, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's the biggest.  Yeah, you're still.  It is.  I'm Yahoo, and I'm also me.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people have me.  What's that mean?  From Mac?  I will never use iCloud.  But now it's at iCloud instead of at me.  They're fucking horrible. 
[01:20:00]  What was the last one before this that they did that was automatic syncing?  It was two or three years ago.  Yes.  What was it called?  I would lose phone numbers all the time.  It would wipe out, like, a month's worth of phone numbers.  I fucking hated it.  Really?  Yeah, it was the cloud.  It would sync three and four times the same numbers.  It was so enraging.  i-something?  iLife?  Was it i-?  No.  iLife?  No, but I'll never use them again.  People can hack your text messages.  If you program it for your text messages to be saved through iCloud, people can hack that. 
[01:20:30]  I don't like that.  So stupid.  I know with backing up shit, it's pretty fucking easy.  I back it up.  I know, because you get a new phone, and it just pulls the shit off of the cloud.  It comes from the clouds.  You don't need it.  It's backing up to iTunes.  You don't have to plug in anything.  You know what I don't like about that that I can never figure out?  You plug some shit in.  You want to sync something.  You want to back up your phone.  And then it's like, all this will be erased.  All this.  If you continue with sync, this will be gone.  Like, I don't want anything to be gone. 
[01:21:00]  I hate calendar conflicts.  Yes.  You old Billy Baruch.  Don't stop it.  Inadvertently.  I never know what fucking calendar conflicts are, which one I should decide with.  Do you want to resolve this now?  No.  Some other day, I'll have a big calendar conflict party and have my friends over.  Certain contacts I have, it's listed four times.  Jesus Christ.  You sync it up, it's like.  Do you, and it asks you if you want to, like, erase stuff.  It's like, you know, it'll be eliminated from this computer if you sync with this. 
[01:21:30]  It's like, why can't I just fucking, don't give me any warnings that I'm going to lose some shit.  You know?  Yeah.  Like, but that's the idea of sync, is like, it replaces everything.  Yeah.  You can't just be like, I just want what's on there, on here.  Right.  And then with everything else.  Yeah.  You want everything.  Right.  No.  Exactly.  There's some, I don't know, I got some ideas.  You do?  Yeah.  About what?  Some ideas.  J'ai une idée.  Like apps and stuff.  I remember that from French, when I took French fucking thing.  J'ai une idée.  What's your idea?  Like, I have an idea or something. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  It was when I had summer school for French, we had to do like a little play.  Yeah.  Ja.  Wait, maman, j'ai un sauté.  Mom, Jack insulted me.  Oh.  Maman.  Sorry, guys.  Jack insulted me.  Hey.  I took the bus to summer school for France, for French.  You took summer school?  For high school French.  For high school French?  You had to go to summer school?  So I could graduate or I could get out.  Yeah.  Or so I could move on to the next grade.  I graduated in summer school.  Oh.  No, no.  I didn't graduate.  Oh, I did. 
[01:22:30]  I didn't graduate senior year.  My father.  Jack m'a un sauté.  Wow.  Sorry.  You got a good inflection there, too.  Thank you.  It's very important.  That must sound horrific to a French person.  I'm sorry.  What were you saying?  Oh, no.  For like certain apps.  I was looking for one.  You ever texting?  Sometimes you can't overtly text the wrong person.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Isn't there a button that you could do like that will have, say, like, are you sure you 
[01:23:00]  want to send this text?  And you could program it to various, like, contacts.  I'm sure it will be that.  It should be that.  Right?  So that way you type the text in and then you hit the button and then, you know, if maybe  your girlfriend or something, you don't want to fucking, you know, send something inadvertently  to her.  I once sent a text that said, good morning, sweetie, to one of the publicists at WWE.  Who's meant for Jess.  But how did you do that?  I've done that a couple of times.  But considering the odds of doing that are so astronomically low. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  I've sent, how are you doing, sweetie, to Ange.  And Ange is like, well, not too bad.  I'm here at your house.  Didn't you send Than a text like years ago?  Yeah, yeah.  That was meant for...  I think I was sexting Than.  Oh, my God.  I did do that.  Yeah.  To Bob Saget.  No way.  It's one of...  Did you misread faggot and you were going to send it to her?  Yeah.  No, I was... 
[01:24:00]  Dude, and Saget told the story in Montreal this year when he brought me on.  I was sending it to a girl.  She would massage me and she would go...  I would go like, I really could use a hand, which was meaning she was going to come over.  She had a fat pussy.  She was sexy and she was going to jerk me off.  Oh, man.  But that was our weird little co-word.  Saget would have done that too, though.  But I...  Yeah, he probably would have.  But I sent it to Bob Saget.  I'm like, oh, God, I meant that for a girl.  Oh, man.  What did he say?  He laughed.  He must have thought it was hilarious.  Yeah, that's one of his favorite stories.  Yeah, yeah.  It all depends on who gets it.  But let's say you got your girlfriend or you got a multitude of, like, three chicks 
[01:24:30]  or something in your phone.  You program the app or whatever it is to those three names.  So not everybody.  You don't have to verify for everybody, but just those names.  Are you sure you want to send this to Sam 5087?  It's like, yeah, and it gives you a heads up, and then you can hit yes.  There is an app for that, actually.  I've never seen it.  I'm creating it.  Well, it would be a great one.  No, I looked.  Believe me.  There's Ask to Send, but that's on jailbroken phones. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  This is the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of O.P. Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Michael Clark Duncan.  Has entered the studio.  Thanks for being here.  O.P. Anthony.  How you doing, sir?  How's it going to be?  Oh, man, you are a big guy.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he is. 
[01:25:30]  We briefly met many years ago at WrestleMania.  Oh, man.  Oh, man, that's right.  Back in Anaheim, years ago.  Love WrestleMania.  That was a long time ago.  Vince McMahon used to take care of us.  He gave us the nice VIP treatment to WrestleMania.  And where was it again at?  Anaheim.  You were in Anaheim.  And you were pretty much sitting in the same area as we were.  But you got involved with the action.  Yeah, just a little bit.  And we're trying to remember who you were involved with.  What was the storyline? 
[01:26:00]  Was it Undertaker?  Was it Undertaker?  No, they just told me they were going to give me some shit when they came out.  Yeah, so they kind of, some guy got your face and you stood up.  Yeah, and everybody went crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, ah, it's going to be some shit.  No, no, no.  That was it.  That's good that that was the extent of your wrestling thing.  I don't want to do that.  Those guys are good.  Goddamn that voice.  Way more athletic.  That's a nice voice.  Did you do a lot of voiceover work?  A lot.  You have, right?  But you know what?  I went to school at the Academy of Radio Broadcasting in Los Angeles.  And actually, I was doing this. 
[01:26:30]  Really?  And an audition for Armageddon came up.  Got to take that one.  Yeah, I took that one.  But this was my first love.  That little movie.  Just one little audition.  We're just the opposite.  We do this because we failed at everything else.  You're forced to do it.  You're forced to.  You're going to pay rent.  You guys look relaxed up here.  Yeah, you know.  New Yorkers have a different attitude.  It's more of a real attitude.  You know, I was in the store last night.  A dude just walked past me.  He just said, respect. 
[01:27:00]  And I was like, that's cool.  That's not like in L.A., man.  Nobody says just respect.  Right.  And you know what he meant.  And it's just a different mentality up here with New York.  Yeah.  Because, see, I'm cold.  You guys aren't cold.  I'm freezing.  Oh, yeah?  I have the big cold.  This is easy.  This winter is easy.  Are you serious?  It hasn't been that bad.  We're lucky so far.  What is it, 40 degrees out, maybe?  Yeah, it's nothing.  That's easy.  I don't like it at all.  I don't like the cold at all.  I don't either.  Yeah.  Now, how do you guys make it through every winter? 
[01:27:30]  The bad ones, it's just you just got to suck it up and go outside.  So you know what you have to do.  Yeah.  You huddle over your steering wheel while you drive.  For some reason, when your nose is against the windshield, that's supposed to keep you warmer when you're driving until you heat off it.  You know how you deal with it?  I lived in Buffalo for three years.  Oh, that was worse.  So you go and live somewhere else where it's worse, and then you come back to this, and  now it's easy.  Where is that single digits up there?  I'm from Chicago.  Oh, so you know.  What are you talking about?  I've been in L.A. for 15 years. 
[01:28:00]  It's a big difference now.  But you have to remember, though, Chicago.  Chicago's got to be way worse than even Buffalo.  You know what the thing was?  When I was trying to decide what kind of career I wanted, I said, it's only two places to go, New York and L.A.  And 15 years ago, I just, I was sitting, I was homeless, and I said, well, I'm not going to no place cold anymore.  And I went to the West Coast, man.  Good choice, man.  Yeah, well, for me it was.  Wait, did you say homeless in there?  Yeah, I used to be homeless, man.  I was homeless twice in my life. 
[01:28:30]  December 24th, 1996, I was on the lakefront, on 47th Street in the lakefront, homeless.  I had four White Castle, two large fries, an apple pie, and an orange drink.  I remember it, because I thought that was going to be my last meal.  That was it.  And it was really a trying time, and I was in this 67 Buick.  I had three garbage bags full of clothes.  And I said, well, this is it for you.  This is what has come to.  Everything that you've done in life has got you right here.  Now, what are you going to do?  I said, first of all, stop crying. 
[01:29:00]  Too big to be crying.  Nobody's around.  What are you crying for?  But can I ask how it got to the point you got homeless?  Just making bad choices in life.  I never smoked, never drank, nothing like that.  But just, I thought that, man, I thought I was the greatest lover in the world.  So I thought, hey, shoot, I should be taken care of, you know.  It just didn't work out that way.  Oh, there's nothing sadder than someone who expects to be, like, sugar mama.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's what I was making.  Oh, wait till they get a load of this.  They'll pay my rent. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, okay, my friend, this is a good gig right here.  And unfortunately, some people get tired of that when they're going to work every day.  You just let them, hey, guess what happened with all my children?  Yes, you'll never believe who came back.  What are you doing?  You're 6'5", 300 pounds, and you're watching all my children?  Oh, that's funny.  So after that, I just said, you know what, I got to get out of here.  And a friend of mine called me, and she said, hey, we got an opening for security.  She said, but you got to travel.  And I'm like, I'm good. 
[01:30:00]  I'm good to travel.  She said, but we leave next week, and the owner would like to see you.  So I went down to the Every Crown Theater, met Shelly Garrett, who at that time had Beauty Shop on the map.  He was traveling, and he said, I need an extra security guy.  I said, I'm ready.  You're the guy.  I left the Buick at the lakefront and hopped on these custom coaches, and we toured for a year.  And our last stop was Los Angeles.  And also, didn't you work for Biggie, too?  Yeah, I was supposed to work for Biggie Smalls the night that that happened. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  And a friend of mine called me and said, hey, you want to switch?  I said, well, who you got?  He said, I got Babyface.  I said, oh, that's cool.  I said, yeah, let's switch.  So we just switched information.  And I went to Soul Train Music Awards with Babyface.  Is your friend okay?  Was he shot or was he okay?  No, he was in the second band.  Wow.  The first band went through, and the other two security things got stopped at the light.  And I know me.  When I work security, I always sit shotgun. 
[01:31:00]  I never just have a person.  Like, if I'm with you, I'm not going to let you sit right there.  That's just not me.  So I would have sat that side.  But once that happened, and he called me the next morning.  He said, Michael, you never guessed what happened.  It happened so quick.  This happened.  I said, are you serious?  He said, yeah, I quit security.  Wow.  That was my last day working security.  That was it, huh?  And I just said, it's not for me.  Yeah, because you're technically with guys who can be targets.  That's why they have security.  And you have to jump in front.  Yeah.  It's like Secret Service. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it is.  If you're ready for that.  Wow.  But you're not physically trained.  Right.  Like a Secret Service.  It's just like you're going out there and carrying a gun.  You're not really trained.  Yeah.  So how do you do that?  And if your mentality isn't there to go push you out of the way and meet you in the shot,  it's no insurance on that.  It's no, you know, you just have a gun.  You just have a big gun.  It's just like a crazy gig.  It really is a frightening job.  It is.  Yeah, without all that training it takes to automatically do something like it's second nature. 
[01:32:00]  You have to see things before it happens.  You'd be like, fuck this.  I'm not doing this.  I would just make believe I was getting in the way.  I would just make believe that I'd try to make my move.  That you move that quickly.  Yeah, just die.  I would act like I didn't see it.  Like, what happened?  I'm looking at that guy.  We're supposed to look at other people?  I thought you said I was okay.  No, you can't do that, man.  Mr. T is another bodyguard.  Chicago.  We're on to become a huge star. 
[01:32:30]  What was he in?  Everything.  Wait, was it Citizen Kane?  No.  Rocky III.  Did you look at him and think, wow, that's kind of a cool career move?  With Mr. T, he set the standard for bodyguards.  He set the standard for bouncers.  Remember, they used to have the old bouncer competitions.  Bouncer competitions.  Where they had to throw a midget and bring through the door.  They only had it one time.  It was hilarious.  That was the first reality thing, I think.  It was like on the Wide World of Sports or something.  Yeah, it was.  And Mr. T came out with a tuxedo, but he had the arms cut out. 
[01:33:00]  We were a tuxedo.  Yes!  I forgot that.  He's got a tuxedo with the arms cut out.  Nobody thought of that.  And for him to be on there with a mohawk and the jewelry.  Badass.  He worked at Dingbats on the north side.  And everybody went up there to Dingbats just to look at Mr. T.  Really?  Just to look at this unusual character.  Right.  We did bodyguard work, but nobody thought to cut the sleeves off and wear a ton of jewelry.  God was an innovator.  Yeah, we all looked the same.  We were cookie cutters.  But Mr. T was this big mansion.  And next thing you know, he's gone to Hollywood. 
[01:33:30]  We're like, that's T.  That's T.  So it was a big thing.  He went to Dunbar High School.  He went to school actually with my sister.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And she used to talk about that he was one of the best football players to come out of Dunbar High School in Chicago.  Is he a big guy like you?  I've never seen him as person.  He's not as tall as me, but he's physically imposing.  Oh, yeah.  Just anything Mr. T does, I like him.  I remember when I first got to Los Angeles, I was on the bus going somewhere.  I think I was going to get some.  I had the nerve to go get aid.  I'll tell you that story.  But I looked out the window, and there's Mr. T in a red Rolls Royce convertible. 
[01:34:00]  I'm like, that's what I want to do.  Oh, man.  But I walked in this.  What are they called when you get money from the government?  Welfare.  Welfare.  I had the nerve to go get welfare because I was hungry instead of L.A.  Not working.  And I walk in this office, and everybody looks tore down.  And I'm sitting up there, and they're looking at me like, you should be playing football somewhere.  What are you doing sitting here trying to?  I felt so bad.  I just got up and ripped my application up, and I left.  Because those people really needed it. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't really need it.  At that time, I was just lazy.  And at the end, seeing Mr. T on the way there.  Yeah, and I said, I got to do something else.  So here I am.  Nice car.  What was the first thing that got you like, wow, I think I'm getting a good foothold in  here?  You know what?  It was being on the set of Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, working with Martin Lawrence, being  security, and seeing how these guys were working a living single with Queen Latifah, who  was so much fun to work with.  I mean, you don't know.  I had to give her a piggyback ride every day to the set. 
[01:35:00]  She's like, come on, Michael, get over here.  I'm like, oh, man.  And I just, you know, you're in security, so what can you say?  No.  So I just get down on all fours, and she's like, let's go.  Come on.  I'm like, hey, okay.  But once you get on the sets and you see that these people are so good at what they  do, I would just say, hey, man, get me in the scene.  I'd say, well, you got to get a resume.  And this guy told me, hey, put anything on your resume.  I was like, anything? 
[01:35:30]  I've never done anything.  He said, what grammar school did you go to?  I said, Shakespeare.  He said, put down you went to the Shakespeare School of Acting.  I said, okay.  And I put it down.  That's funny.  I put that down.  You're not going to check?  Yeah.  He said, just put stuff down.  He said, did you do a play at Shakespeare?  I said, yeah.  It was fifth grade.  He said, Shakespeare School of Acting.  That sounds good to me.  So I put that down.  And slowly, Jamie Foxx put me in one of the episodes.  And I was so nervous.  You know, everybody broke for lunch.  I didn't know what to do. 
[01:36:00]  I sat there on the set.  The lights go.  And I'm just sitting there like, uh, uh, it's a, if we eat lunch now, or I have a trailer  to go to, and it wasn't no trailer, and I just sat there until everybody started filtering  back in.  I didn't know what to do, so I just sat there.  But I did that.  I did Married with Children.  Did a lot of, a lot of stuff.  Did you ever take formal acting classes, or no?  You just...  No.  My first acting coach was Larry Moss, and he's big up here now.  He's in New York.  And if you ever, if any actors out there really want to go into something really deep, look 
[01:36:30]  up Larry Moss, because he's the one that took me to those levels in the Green Mile.  Warner Brothers hired him to work with me.  And I had just got to do an Armageddon, so I thought I was an actor.  I mean, you can't tell me I don't know how to act.  So I walked in Larry Moss's office.  He lived in Santa Monica.  And I'm like, who's this guy?  He looks weird to me.  And I read the first couple of lines from Green Mile.  He said, hey, that's okay.  He said, you don't have it.  Oh, shit.  And I said, well, wait a minute. 
[01:37:00]  I just read 409.  He said, you just don't have it.  And I'm thinking, Armageddon's getting ready to come out in a couple of weeks.  Do you want to see what I got?  I got it.  You've got it.  But it was two different types of movies.  Completely different types of movies and characters, too.  I didn't understand that.  When he said you don't have it, he didn't mean you didn't have talent.  He meant you didn't have this guy.  Just this guy right here.  As opposed to when they say that to Jimmy.  Yeah, with your Jim, you don't got it.  And then you wind up here.  So I went back and he gave me another chance. 
[01:37:30]  I begged him to give me another chance.  And he explained to me, this is what this guy has to be.  He has to be five years old.  You can't be this big overpowering.  That's not this character.  So I went back and I did a little better.  He said, okay, I can work with you.  And we worked together like four days a week.  That was the best part of the character is you just see this imposing man come in.  And he turns out to be a kitten.  But the thing was, we were going and there was this young lady coming.  She was taking Larry Moss, too. 
[01:38:00]  And we would talk at the elevator.  She'd be leaving.  I'd be coming in.  And she'd say, yeah, he's a weird dude.  But he's cool.  He knows what he's doing.  And we didn't never get each other's name.  And finally, I'm at the Show West Awards show.  And the girl says, Michael.  And I say, what's your name?  She's like, I'm Hillary Swank.  We work with Larry Moss.  It was Hillary Swank.  She was going for Boys Don't Cry, in which that year she won every award.  So Larry Moss is a legend.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now I know who I can look up and I can blame when I don't get something.  Larry Moss. 
[01:38:30]  And the show, I only saw part of it because the link I had was, they gave us links.  Right.  And there was a problem with the links.  So I got, it was like the first, I think, 20 minutes.  And it's called The Finder.  Yes.  And it's a one-hour procedure.  Yes.  What's the procedural?  You know what?  That gets me, too.  No, I've never heard that term.  Procedural.  But you play, I don't want to say, is it a cop or a detective?  And it's got like a weird vibe, like John Fogerty.  It's like a 70s show almost.  Yeah.  Where they have this singer looking for some of his items as guitarist all. 
[01:39:00]  And Fogerty sings a little of his own music.  I play Leo Knox, a character that Walter Sherman is good friends with.  I'm a lawyer.  I own the bar, the ends of the earth bar.  I'm his bodyguard, his confidant.  I'm his best friend.  Leo Knox came into Walter's life because at a time my family was killed and I was going  to kill the people that murdered my family.  And Walter came into my life and stopped me from doing that.  And I used to weigh like 400 pounds and he got me to reading books and things like that.  So now I'm Walter's guy.  So no matter what he does, I understand him. 
[01:39:30]  He has this weird gift that he can find anything.  And in one of the opening scenes, he finds John Fogerty's guitar pick.  Right.  That's all he wants.  He doesn't worry about money.  I take care of the money.  He wants the most unusual thing.  So that's the first episode is going to be really good.  And it airs Thursday.  Now when you do something like this, do you start worrying about reviews or a movie or  anything or do you not even care?  No, I let it go.  You have to let it go because if you start worrying about that, you're going to drive  yourself crazy.  And I have a saying that the world is won by those who let it go. 
[01:40:00]  If you don't even think about it, you can't worry because it doesn't change anything.  Right.  What's going to happen Thursday and then week after that and week after that is going  to happen.  I let it go.  I let it go right after I bitch at the guy.  Yeah.  Really?  You let it go up here too.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, before I let it go, you son of a bitch.  Yeah, you just let it go.  Yeah, right after I mail a Unabomber package to him, I let it go.  And it's just to promote what it's on too.  It's called The Finder.  Yeah.  And it's on tomorrow night, which is Thursday, 9 o'clock on Fox. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  And that's a great time slot to have.  I'm annoyed that I couldn't see the entire show.  Stokes is The Finder.  And somebody, we were doing press the other day, and somebody made the mistake of saying  he looked like Tom Brady.  And I had to hear that.  Oh, no.  And I had to hear that.  And he texted me and said, just remember, I look like Tom Brady.  I'm like, don't look like Tom Brady.  He just told me.  But some woman said, oh, he's cute.  He looks like Tom Brady.  And I'm like, oh, shit.  Did you shoot this in Miami?  It looked like Miami.  A lot of Miami, a lot of L.A. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, okay.  A lot of both places.  That's a great life to have.  You're in like two phenomenally warm places in the middle of the winter.  Miami was just the greatest place to film.  It was really nice.  How many episodes did you guys do?  We're on episode.  I'm still working.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Yeah, we're on episode 11 of 13.  By the way, was that not a question of somebody who just doesn't do a lot of acting work?  Oh, you mean they don't shoot it in real time?  We're an absolute idiot.  No, man.  You guys are good, man.  How are you liking TV?  I love TV.  I love TV.  It's a lot faster, though.  It's like a blitz, and you're a rookie quarterback, and the starter got hurt. 
[01:41:30]  And everybody comes up to the line, barking, and they're, I'm going to get you.  I'm going to mess you up.  And I didn't understand it.  The first episode, I was always writing stuff down to try to keep up with my lines.  But you have to study differently.  You have to allot yourself time.  Over the holidays, about four days into the holidays, they sent me the new script, Script  11.  So I started breaking my script down, and I studied over the holidays, because I take it  seriously, and I think that's what you have to do. 
[01:42:00]  What do you do when you look at a script, or you look at a character like Leo in this?  Do you say, okay, this is who this guy is, and kind of build a backstory, or do you just  kind of do it as yourself?  They do the backstory, but I will take the character.  Like Leo, in the first episode, the backdoor pilot, as we called it, to Bones, I didn't  like the way my character looked.  I didn't like the way I looked.  But I was like, I said, I'm going to change everything about this character.  This character is going to be a no-nonsense type of guy. 
[01:42:30]  In the backdoor pilot, he was kind of goofy, and he, you know, to me, I didn't like the  way it was going.  And I told Hart Hanson, who created Bones, and who created this show, I said, I'm going  to take this guy in another direction.  I want him to be a badass, really.  He doesn't smile a lot.  He has his own way of doing things.  He's very serious.  So I took it in a whole nother direction, but I think you guys will like the direction  I took Leo Knox in.  So they had, had you started shooting yet, or are you just from reading the script and  doing the read-throughs, you're like, I don't know?  No, I had done the backdoor pilot with Bones, and actually David Boreanaz and Emily DeChanel 
[01:43:00]  are wonderful over there at Bones.  Oh, man, I call them varsity.  We go on the lot, we look at their trailers, ooh.  Look at their trailers.  So it's a big deal, because they've been on seven, eight years, and they've been number  one in their time slot, and their trailers are just, like, humongous.  Yeah.  And then we go to our trailer, and you're just like, oh, wow.  Yeah.  Something to work for.  There's nothing to work for watching somebody peel off to a better trailer, and you're in  a honey wagon.  We go there and rub it.  We rub it.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  We have to step up.  One day.  One day.  You ever have the ones where you get to pee in the sink?  I've had quite a few of those.  I haven't had that in my early days.  Yeah, I don't feel like going up the steps.  I do that at home after some nice, you know, little.  Well, I wish you a lot of luck with it, too, because I know it's always scary when a series  starts.  You know, you want, are people going to watch it?  Are people going to like it?  Yeah.  The networks nowadays don't give it, like years ago, MASH was not doing well.  Seinfeld, like a lot of these shows that turned out to be these amazing shows.  Yeah, they did.  They judge shows a little bit too quickly now.  They do. 
[01:44:00]  They do, because there's so many out there, and there's so many things that have been  written that are just waiting to take your place.  Right, right.  You guys could be on the hot seat.  Somebody's out there waiting.  Jeez.  Yeah.  You just got to stay on top.  You know what I like about TV shows, though, especially ones that go a few seasons, is the  character development that you don't get with a movie, because the movie's pretty much  not done chronologically.  Right.  Sometimes a character in the first season will be completely different.  From the second season, third season.  Second, third, yeah.  They kind of grow with the show, and that's, I've always liked that as opposed to movies 
[01:44:30]  where you get the character at the beginning of the movie the same as at the end.  I think, when I looked at it, I wanted to do like 24.  You guys remember 24?  Sure, yeah.  I wanted to shoot people in the head.  And they were like, Hart was like, no, it's not that type of show.  I said, well, just let me, you know, let me shoot somebody, get some information out  of them, and just, you know, do the, that's what I wanted to do.  And they said, no, it's really not that type of show.  I said, well, can I just have a gun?  Can I just point and say, give me that information?  I just want to do that one time. 
[01:45:00]  That's all I want to do.  You just want to be cool.  I just want to be cool like Jack Bauer was.  And I told somebody, I said, well, I went to meet the directors and the producers over  at 24.  They were thinking about casting me.  So I said, okay, be cool, don't get excited, you know, because I can get amped up.  So I'm over there and they're showing me CTU and I'm like, man, this is cool.  I got, this is where so-and-so got killed.  This is where they let the anthrax go to them.  I'm like, you know, this is really cool. 
[01:45:30]  And so we're getting ready to leave and a van pulls up and out jumps Keith or Sutherland.  Well, I'm seeing Jack Bauer and I'm like, that's a white van.  That's how they always come out.  And I rush up to him.  Hey, how you doing?  My name is Michael Clark Duggan.  I'm the eight.  You remember when you shot Roger Cross?  Roger Cross is a friend of mine.  For 30 seconds on the inside, I'm like, Michael, dial it down, dial it down.  I couldn't.  I went through every episode, every scene.  Oh, man.  You remember when the president got shot?  I thought you were going to kill that guy.  And I'm going, and he's like, okay. 
[01:46:00]  He must have been to get security.  They never, you never saw me again.  That was it.  There's our promo up there.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at that.  You don't have to be here.  Yeah, you can just.  Oh, yeah, I know these people.  Yeah, that's my boy Jeff Stoltz.  The Finder.  There it is.  Tomorrow night, 9 o'clock on Fox.  At least they're going to promote it right.  Oh, hell yeah.  So now I've gotten a lot cooler when I meet celebrities.  I don't.  Yeah, I like the fact you're not that jaded, though.  No, no, I've never.  I stay the same.  Stay the same.  I don't want to ever get like jaded or think I'm real cool or, you know, you don't touch me. 
[01:46:30]  They have a joke on set.  They say, Michael, by season two, you'll be telling people don't look at you.  And that's why I tell them, did you eyeball me?  Out of here.  I want him out.  He just looked at me.  So that's my joke on set.  I've heard guys are like that, too.  There are some guys, they don't want you looking at them.  They don't want you, you know, speaking to them.  They don't want the extra, the background people.  I go to speak to all the background players because they helped me.  I did background ones.  Do you think the humble beginnings and going through a point in life where you were homeless,  that that stays with you, doesn't it? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, it stays with you.  And you never take it to where you don't think it can't happen again.  Right.  You got that constant little thing over your head going like, I remember that.  Always in the back of your mind.  I remember that.  Everything, you could lose everything in an instant.  Yeah, yeah.  So you should be kind to people regardless.  No, but it's nice to remember where you came from.  It is.  You come from a, it's almost like, hey, if life was fair, would I be doing this?  Right.  I don't need to philosophize for you.  So that's why I'm pretending I'm him.  That's what I'm saying.  You guys are nice.  You guys are cool.  Yeah, we try to be.  We've been run through the mill.  That's why.  We remember. 
[01:47:30]  I got to ask them.  Yeah, go ahead.  Are we a lot of mentioned?  Who, my baby back there?  Omarosa?  Oh, man, that's my girl.  Are you guys?  That's my girl, man.  That is my girl.  That's Omarosa from The Apprentice.  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  She's the new.  I'm a big fucking fan.  She's the new editor of the West Coast Magazine, Reality TV.  Really?  Oh, man.  So she has a lot of meetings up here.  And actually, she came in a couple of days earlier to do her press.  But, yeah, she takes care of me.  We knew she was going to be here with a rigged the ceiling tile to fall or something.  Okay, watch it. 
[01:48:00]  Watch it.  Do not do that.  That's my baby.  That's my girlfriend.  I hear you.  But, damn, that was hilarious.  Do you know how great it would be if he just picked you up and threw you through the window?  Right in the window.  Well, I just keep staring at Omarosa, man.  No, she's beautiful, man.  She's beautiful.  She is gorgeous.  Beautiful on TV, but I got to say, even more beautiful in real life.  We got up this morning.  She met me here.  And it's a joy.  Just rolled out of bed, right?  It's a joy to have somebody.  That's how you look when you roll out of bed.  To have somebody that understands what you do. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  You know, and people get the misconception that, I mean.  And I told her, I said, babe, you built up a certain image that people can't forget easily.  It's just like nobody forgets the green mile.  That's what I'll always be known for.  Sure.  It doesn't make a difference what else I do.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  There's nothing wrong with that.  So, a lot of people don't know how kind she is, how sweet she is.  She cooks for me.  Oh, man.  I can't tell you what this woman has done for my life.  You're embarrassing her.  I know.  I like to do that.  She gets nervous when I start talking about her.  You should turn around because she's giving you looks like. 
[01:49:00]  That's my baby, man.  I didn't see the show.  Did you come off kind of.  I did not see that show.  You didn't see Omarosa?  That was like the time when it was kind of the biggest.  Yeah.  That was the biggest season, I think, ever.  I'm already wrapped up in my own loneliness.  I just didn't see it.  Oh, okay.  She didn't take anyone's shit.  Oh, you were harsh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, she was.  No, she is.  She can be that way.  But she's very sweet.  But very sweet.  What season was that?  God damn, it was early on.  It was, right?  Oh, you were on the first season?  I wasn't sure if it was first or second. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Did you like.  I'll just ask you in general.  Were you happy with the way they edited it as a reality?  Because you hear so many people when they do something like that.  They come back and they go, ah, they didn't portray me right.  They edited it wrong.  Or they totally changed the picture.  I'd have been happier if I won.  Okay.  Oh, well.  A lot better at it.  Did it help you, though, right?  Helped you a lot?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  But you turned out all right, baby.  You turned out all right.  Did all right.  Look at this.  How a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are.  She does.  But to date a woman who's got fame and who's beautiful, you have to kind of be on Michael's 
[01:50:00]  level.  You can't just, you know, a guy like me.  Can't be you.  I didn't want to say it like that.  Don't do it, Mike.  Don't worry.  I will.  You can't be me in a stupid t-shirt with my fat stomach.  We're getting the wrap-up, unfortunately.  Oh, man.  Well, I have one question that is coming in here.  Go ahead.  A big fan wants to know, in Talladega Nights, when you guys are doing the scene, don't you  put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby, how many takes?  Because it's obvious you were laughing so damn hard during that.  Ad-libbed.  Really? 
[01:50:30]  Ad-libbed.  I mean, when you're working with Will Ferrell, I mean, they go off on, I mean, I'm at home  in my hotel room.  I'm studying.  Okay, he says this.  I come in, I say this.  I'm thinking it's going to be like that.  They get out there, and it's just whatever.  It's just whoever says this, you just got to know when to come in.  And I'm looking at Will, and I'm like, he didn't say that.  And the director's like, go ahead, go, go, go, get in there, say something.  And I'm like, hey, don't you put that evil on me.  The first time I said, I said, don't put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby.  And the director's like, cut, he said, Michael, come here. 
[01:51:00]  He said, go in on him.  He said, I want you freaking mad.  You go in on him.  You are not about to go in on him.  So I go back out there, and that's what I did.  And it was one take.  One take.  Yeah, and you could see you guys were almost dying laughing.  Oh, the whole night thing.  Die and laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  They were just Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And, oh, man, Sasha Baron Cohen, you get those four together, it's hard to do a scene  and not laugh.  It is funny, man. 
[01:51:30]  Off camera, when Will Ferrell was running around in his underwear, he did it off camera.  And he was just running, he had these dirty underwear, and we're like, you can't help but  to laugh.  He is a funny guy.  Yeah, he's funny in everything he did.  Everything, man.  Even bad movies.  You know, you're not going to have all of them.  No, but I mean, it's fair enough.  He's funny, man.  He knows what to do.  But not every movie you're in is going to be great.  No, no, it's not.  But even the ones that are so-so, he's hilarious.  He is, always has been.  That's all I'm trying to say.  I'm not trying to kill the guy. 
[01:52:00]  I love Will Ferrell.  Oh, he's good.  We've had John C. Reilly, and he's amazing.  Oh, funny.  He's funny, from Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  Is he a Chicago guy?  Yeah.  I love him in Boogie Nights.  Oh, man, wasn't he good?  Yeah.  I love working with guys like that that just have talent.  Like you guys.  Now, who's the most talented?  Oh, my God.  He's very polite of him to ask.  Now you're going to cause problems.  Obviously, that's why we're together.  Okay.  Now you're going to cause problems.  Is Howard Stern up here?  He's across the hall down the hill, yeah.  He took all the green rooms from you guys?  And all the green.  And all the green, yeah.  Paper green, the green rooms. 
[01:52:30]  He was here first.  We were on satellite first.  He gets the green room.  And our guests, we have the thing that window washers use.  Yeah, I went in that thing right there.  We have our guests actually sit outside with the window washers.  It's time you guys stand up for yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah, come on.  A metal chair for our guests.  What is going on?  You guys got to stand up.  You are right.  How about you stand up for us?  That would help.  I'm going to tell you how to do it.  You just call serious and say, hey, look, if this doesn't change, we're out.  We try that.  And then we'll have a lot of time off.  That's great.  Are you going to hire us, Michael?  Once you throw that card down, you've got to play it. 
[01:53:00]  Michael, remember when you were talking about rubbing the trailer?  Right.  That's exactly what it's like around here with us.  You have to go in that green room and we'll be here one day.  We go to the honey wagon.  And then the security says, hey, get away from us.  You saw our green room.  It's our office.  Yeah, that's cool, though.  You're sitting in my seat or aunt's seat.  Humble beginnings.  Remember that.  Humble beginnings.  We've been at this 17 years, sir.  Yeah, humble.  This combo is 17 years.  In five years from now, each of you guys will be making $85 million.  I'm going to put it out there right now.  And when I come back, I'm going to say, wow, I remember Opie and Anthony.  They're big timing now. 
[01:53:30]  Maybe if you could go down the hall and breathe some flies into one of the management's mouths.  I will tell management on the way out, you guys deserve a raise.  We're going to hire you to be our muscle.  Hey, man, do it.  Let's do it.  October's coming soon, man.  We're hiring you for muscle.  This is New York.  Why don't you speak for us?  Just be our agent.  It's amazing to have an agent that actually talks for you.  It would be really nice.  That would be nice.  I put my foot in my mouth in Chicago.  I went there to see the mayor of Chicago, and he was going to give me an award or something.  It was just during a teacher strike. 
[01:54:00]  And I always believed that teachers should be making the $250,000 a year.  I mean, everybody here had teachers they remember, and we would not be where we are.  Well, maybe.  You guys have different type of teachers, but, you know.  No, I agree with that teacher stuff.  It's unbelievable that they're so underpaid.  They don't get paid the money that they deserve.  And I stood up and I said that in Chicago, and the mayor just looked at me.  Oh, no.  And he was just saying, but I didn't care because it was the truth.  Right.  And I can remember all my teachers' names and their grades because they played a profound way of the way I was raised. 
[01:54:30]  And, boy, when I got back to my room, I thought I was going to get this nice plaque that said, hey, Chicago's on.  I got a book of Chicago.  A book of Chicago.  Like, I don't know where Chicago is.  It's like me giving you a guide to New York.  Right, right, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, this is your guide.  So that's all I got.  So you think he was a little upset with your, maybe that's been a big political thing.  Maybe just a little bit.  He had probably just cut the budget for the teachers or something.  I thought you were jabbing them.  I just think teachers deserve a lot more than what they get paid. 
[01:55:00]  Going to those classrooms with some bad kids sometimes, I couldn't do it because I'd roll a coffin in.  Whoever cries, whoever curses, go lay in the coffin for 15 minutes.  This is going to be your life if you don't listen to me.  That's the way I do it.  Bravo.  With that, we've got to get you out of here.  The finders.  Yeah, we're going to check it out.  I liked what I saw, but I just need a better link, which, you know.  Yeah, come on, man.  Step up.  Step up, baby.  We like this Michael Clark Duncan.  You've got to come back and see us.  Anytime for you guys.  And Omarosa, what do we got?  Twitter or something?  Yeah, Michael's on Twitter.  Official MCD. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, listen to that voice, man.  What about your Twitter?  I'm Omarosa on Twitter.  But he's official MCD.  Look at her.  She always plays.  Is he going to be following you on Twitter, at least?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, good.  All right.  Yeah, we follow you on Twitter.  We do, man.  And if you just happen to want to buy Reality Weekly magazine, that would help me out a lot.  She's the West Coast editor.  She's sexy.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Can you just don't...  That's another time.  Yeah.  I will save that for another time.  Sorry.  I appreciate you guys, man.  I really do, man.  All right.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:56:00]  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Fuck.  Sirius XM.  You realize it's Jim Norton's birthday today, right, Dice?  Why do you think I'm here?  All right.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, thank you.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Hello, madam.  It's melting.  Oh, okay.  It's melting because you're carrying it, baby. 
[01:56:30]  I tell you that much right now.  It looks like the inside of my boxers.  Get the bun out of your head.  Do me a favor.  You don't like that?  What's that?  No, I mean, look at this.  She's all beautiful.  This is what I'm saying, but she got the bun.  She got a knot.  Yeah, Dice doesn't like the hair up is what he's saying.  No, we just had a whole discussion about it.  I mean, you're a beautiful girl and everything.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm going for the Robert Palmer look.  Well, don't.  Do yourself a favor.  You know what I mean?  You had to hang down. 
[01:57:00]  You know what I mean?  Next thing you know, you're in a bar with some new guys.  She's lovely.  She's very nice.  Thank you, miss.  Happy birthday.  Oh, you don't know her, Norton?  No.  We've never met.  Well, say something to her.  What's your name?  I'm Adrian.  Oh, with Rocky.  Oh, that's a good one.  I didn't know he was at home.  That's a great pickup line.  I hear it all the time, so it's fine.  Oh, okay.  Where are you from?  From New York.  No, I mean a club or something?  Yeah, from HQs.  I'm on Dennis Rodman's topless basketball team, so. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  You ever bang Dennis?  No.  Would you?  Never.  Business and pleasure are different.  It should be about you and her.  Forget about her.  I want something to jerk off to later.  That's brilliant.  And the idea of her and Dennis.  We're going to be having a show in Vegas.  Like, that's where we're going to be based on.  Can we see what Dennis saw in you?  Yeah.  We didn't see anything yet.  Have you given him a lap dance before?  No.  Did you just get on the team?  Excuse me?  Did you just get on the team?  No.  No.  We've been promoting it for like four months, so.  It's topless basketball. 
[01:58:00]  We've been in the Post.  It's been on the Today Show.  Okay.  This is very good.  See, I got it at.  I don't go to regular basketball games.  No.  But I got it at.  You got it at.  I got it at.  You got big dudes, so.  You know what I mean?  All that helmet pitching in the.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, it sells.  Yeah, yeah.  You want some?  No, thank you.  I really shouldn't.  What is it?  Ice cream cake?  Yeah, it's fucking good.  Dice, you can't.  Are you going to be topless?  Sorry.  I mean, you play basketball?  You know what?  I can't have that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's too early.  Obviously. 
[01:58:30]  Nice.  No topless?  I don't know.  I'd love to see Topless.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Throw one out there.  Come on.  We'll get a basketball.  Throw one out there.  You know what?  Throw one out there.  I'll take my dick out.  What do I care?  Dim the lights a little.  Give her a little music.  Let's calm the situation down a little bit.  Yeah, what if we got your basketball?  This is right.  You want a girl to just walk into the office over here.  You got the lights on like you're doing surgery.  Everything is lighting.  That's how I came up with the lava lights. 
[01:59:00]  The LCD lights in the closet.  What's better than that?  Dice.  But you want to look good in bright light.  You don't want to look good in dark.  Let's lower the voices.  Let's see what happens here.  All right.  So look at me, honey.  What do you got going on over there?  Look at me.  Talk to me.  It's your birthday.  Where are you going?  That's not how you say it.  Where are you going, baby?  Yeah, that's right.  Where are you going, madam?  Oh, no.  That isn't it either.  Where are you going or something?  How did you get recruited for this? 
[01:59:30]  I'm friends with the owner that owns HQs.  Microphone.  I'm friends with the owner that owns HQs, and he's best friends with Dennis, so he's  introduced me to Dennis.  I mean this gig, bringing in the cake.  Yeah.  How'd they commit you?  Oh, just the publicist.  And just...  Oh.  So you get a free plug for Topless.  Oh.  Where's this tape from Topless?  She didn't care?  I don't know.  See, when they just throw the hair in the bun, Anthony, they're not caring. 
[02:00:00]  Right, right, right.  If she really cared about Norton and his birthday, the hair would be down.  The down hair.  You know what I mean?  You walk in a certain way.  I hear you.  It's like, here, big boy, all of a sudden, he's popping wood, and everybody goes on a  winner.  I hear you.  So you don't think she would go on a first date with her hair in a bun?  Yeah, if you went on a first date, would you wear your hair in a bun?  No.  Um, it depends.  No, don't, don't, don't post it.  I have a beautiful face, so why does it matter if I have short hair, long hair, like, whatever? 
[02:00:30]  Because women, women, and I agree with the beautiful face, that's why I'm saying, God  gave you the beautiful hair to let down, to make the guys drool.  But then if I wear my hair down, then you can't see other things, and it's just...  Oh, we're not going to see anything anyway.  What can I see?  The back of your neck?  I'll get to that later.  That's the fun.  You've got to move it out of the way, and then you just chomp it.  Oh, my God.  You know what I mean?  Like a leech hooking on.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, romance stuff.  No winners here today, Dice. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, there's no winners here today.  She's not going to do nothing for him.  I don't think so.  But she's not a stripper.  We know that, but...  No?  You know, when you play...  But if anyone's hoppers in front of a hole...  If you have a basketball...  You've danced before?  Yeah.  You had the...  Who got you to bring me a cake?  Like, where'd the cake come from?  Who brought the cake in?  I made some cake.  Something about a cake?  Get rolling.  Yeah.  Rollin set this up.  Who brought the cake in?  Rollin got a girl...  Yeah, Rollin, get in here.  You know what?  My friend here, Jim Florentine, he's getting married.  Yeah, so he's married, but it's not, like, in a week yet, so... 
[02:01:30]  So who had...  I'm sorry, how did we work this out?  Who's the...  Yeah, what happened, Rollin?  She brought the cake?  No, I brought the cake.  Thank you, Rollin.  I went all the way down to the east side to get...  Thank you very much.  What's up with her?  She doesn't want to...  We have no winners here today, Rollin.  How did you recruit...  No, I'm good.  How did you get a girl for this?  Yeah, we have no winners.  No winners.  No.  You what?  Oh, Lainey.  Yeah.  Oh, I love Lainey.  Oh, okay.  Lainey probably didn't do stuff now.  Lainey usually gets someone that... 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, goers.  ...will make winners.  Yeah.  Out of everybody.  He's a birthday boy today.  Yeah.  Do you want cake?  It's amazing.  Yeah?  Doesn't it always feel good when it's your birthday?  I want to blow my brains out.  I hate my birthday.  What?  Really?  Oh, boy.  I hate it.  Well, come over.  Oh, where are you going?  Oh, my gosh.  I'm trying to make a sneak run.  No, let her go.  Let her go.  Let her go.  Let her go.  Yeah, we don't need it.  She don't want it.  Yeah, don't let her go.  You know, I don't beg for it.  There she goes.  Hang on a bad foot.  Yeah, right here.  Why do we do that?  You have that nice...  You like that thick look.  She had that thick look.  Get Lainey in here.  Let's run Lainey through them. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, bring Lainey in.  You know what I liked about it?  You know what I liked about it?  She had some mass.  She was sexy, but...  I don't know if she wasn't.  You know what I mean?  I like a chick with a little mass.  Hi, Lainey.  That was a lot of mass.  Thank you.  Lainey, we're disappointed in your choice today.  That girl was awful.  She was cute, but she wouldn't even take her top off.  She's going to have topless basketball.  In front of a crowd.  Yeah, you're saying it to a whole world of human beings, and then you don't, you know,  drop a tit on the table.  It's a birthday.  She dances at headquarters, so she probably wants people to come into headquarters and 
[02:03:00]  see her there.  Why would anybody go see her there?  She can sell herself.  After that horrendous...  There's six guys in here.  Here's a cake.  I'm leaving.  She didn't have to...  Here's a cake.  I'm leaving?  Yeah, it was awful.  She wouldn't even show her breasts.  You know what?  Some of these chicks get intimidated until they're actually bouncing up and down on your cock.  But it's like everybody loosens up when that's happening.  I don't think that was it, though.  No, it wasn't.  She just came in.  We failed Jim Norton today.  You know what?  She did it like...  No, you didn't.  You did not fail me.  She did.  You know what you're saying, Norton?  She did it like it was just the job.  I've had people fucking... 
[02:03:30]  She hated being here, Dice, right?  No, she was excited to me.  She wasn't excited.  She actually was looking at all her stuff online, Jimmy.  My doctor was sexier when she fucking told me I had herpes.  No.  Well, you know, I got a beautiful...  You know, I love when they get that, like when you're going out, you know, and they go,  well, she's got a nice face.  I go, for what?  Punching?  You know what I mean?  Don't tell me I'm nice.  I'm seeing your fucking face.  Draw your tits out there.  Make an event happen. 
[02:04:00]  Did you make her feel welcome?  What?  She's very pretty.  She didn't want to show her breasts.  Very pretty.  But she didn't want to show her breasts.  And then we're like, did you ever dance?  And she's like, well, I have.  Duck mouth.  Like, ugh.  Yeah.  It's like when you're banging the chick in the ass.  I thought she was sexy, but...  You're banging the chick in the ass, right?  And she's going like this.  I used to be really good at this.  Oh, my God.  She's probably so intimidated by you.  She's not intimidated.  No, she just was one of those...  She didn't want to be here.  She didn't want to be here.  She obviously...  I know one thing that doesn't intimidate her.  Donuts.  If you guys want to see a girl who will not take her top off, feel free to go to that club 
[02:04:30]  and watch her.  Lainey's usually really good for us.  I am.  You really are.  I am.  But, you know, she's a dancer.  But go get another one.  Go on.  Go on.  Get somebody else now.  But that's why we never...  I mean, I love Lainey.  Get another birthday treat for him.  But that's why we don't take dancers.  That's why we don't have them come in, because they always pull that shit.  The dancers do.  It's not like we wanted to touch her or anything.  No.  None of that stuff.  We just want to see her tits.  But, like, you're going to play topless basketball.  Trill the viewership.  You dance naked.  Trill the viewership.  And you won't show your tits in a room full... 
[02:05:00]  Trill the fucking viewers.  What the fuck do you think you're doing in here?  Exactly.  Because she's so fucking smart.  You know who I miss the most in moments like this?  Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, boy.  Would he have been a treat with that?  Yeah.  Oh, he'd have laid out the scenario perfectly.  That's why we don't like dancers.  I don't think she's probably used to this.  She's going to play new basketball for Dennis Robin.  Of course she's used to it.  I think it was her first time on national radio.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:05:30]  Don't listen to me.  Go out there.  You've got a whole floor full of chicks.  Go find another one.  Go make some calls.  Throw one in here.  They flash the tits.  Everybody goes home a winner.  That's why we never...  We love Lainey.  It's not Lainey.  This is the opening.  No worries, guys.  We never take dancers.  That's why.  Exactly.  They always do shit like that.  They always do that.  What do you mean you don't want to?  Why?  I'm not going to grab you?  That's why I never even got into going to strip clubs.  Because I know it's just all a fucking show.  It's all shit.  You know what I mean?  It's all professional.  Like, we're comics.  We know what the...  They come in there. 
[02:06:00]  They give the fake seduction.  Yeah.  And it's not interesting.  No, no.  Not at all.  Not fucking interested.  I want a real ho that really likes opening her fucking legs and just...  Right to your fucking yam bag.  You fucking pig what you are.  Somebody that cares about what happens.  Lady, thanks for putting your hair down today.  Yeah.  Unlike your friend.  Not here.  It's $1,500 in your right pit.  I love you guys.  I'm sorry.  I'm disappointed.  I'm sorry.  I'm disappointed.  It was awful, but it's not your fault.  Jimmy, I'll make it up to you next time.  You don't owe me anything. 
[02:06:30]  Do it now.  Do it now.  You don't owe me anything.  When are you going to make it up?  Thank God his birthday's every day.  I woke up for this.  Thank God for that.  I woke up.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  We failed you.  You didn't fail me.  We failed you more.  If you guys want to go watch a girl who won't take her top off, go to the club and watch  her.  I'm sure she's terrific.  Look at the anger.  I'm sure she'll take her top off.  That's literally like me getting hired for a fucking...  They say, hey, could you go in and tell a joke to someone, and me walking in and go,  yeah, you know, this Zimmerman thing is really sad, and turning around and walking  out.  Right.  That's the fucking equivalent of me refusing to do a joke. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Jim, don't you tell jokes?  Oh, I have.  Blah, blah, blah.  And it's not like she's retired.  She's going to be in front of crowds topless.  She's going to play topless basketball.  Maybe if you guys eased into it a little bit.  We did.  That's what it is.  You're supposed to do like one second.  How is Dennis Rodman going to ease into it?  You've got to warm her up a little bit.  Take your tits out and make a jump shot.  How is she not easing into it?  Where is she now?  I don't know.  She wasn't embarrassed with that gut.  I would figure crying.  I thought she was very afraid.  Did she flee the building of no rules?  I was attracted to it.  Or no laws. 
[02:07:30]  No laws.  The building has no laws.  The building of no laws.  Duck bill mouth.  No, Dice likes that.  I was attracted to it physically.  He didn't like the thick look on that.  I was attracted to it.  No, it bothered me because a thick girl shouldn't have her hair tied up to a fucking knot.  Yeah.  It wasn't even a bun.  It's worse.  It's a different level when it's a knot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The knot just says, I don't give a fuck.  That wasn't a bun.  It was a knot.  You're right.  And that's what I like to make a living.  She's got to jump up and down with her tits bouncing like on a trampoline.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  You wear the hair down, you go to a bar on a Saturday night, some sucker's going to pick  you up, start lacing you with his load.  Next thing you know, you're married with three fucking kids.  Yeah, them what?  Your hair's in a knot.  You're on a basketball court going, look at my dopey tits.  Look what personality my tits fucking has.  We got an update, Sam.  White strippers suck.  I tell you, black or Spanish girls.  Black or Spanish, always.  Always go with the ethnic.  Hold on.  Sam has something.  We got up just doing some eavesdropping.  You want to quote?  Yeah.  Well, I would have if they weren't so rude. 
[02:08:30]  That's bullshit.  That's bullshit.  That's always a great excuse.  We've been at this game for a long time.  That is such bullshit.  He's been at this game for a long time.  Dice fucking lowered his voice and was a gentleman.  He's been playful.  I lowered my voice because he's been doing this.  You are a gentleman, Dice.  You are a fucking gentleman.  Everybody was.  You were talking about Dice Clay.  What are you saying?  Dice was rude.  I think she was referring to Dice.  Oh, Dice was rude.  This is a comedy show.  Can we bring her back in to Dice?  This is a comedy show. 
[02:09:00]  She wasn't doing it anyway.  Kenny's got intel.  She's got intel.  Hold on.  What happened?  What happened, Kenny?  She might have been insulted by the bunt comments.  Too bad.  Is she still out there?  You want to make nice with her?  You want to know something?  Let's make nice with her.  I'm not the one that told her to go in the bedroom and put your hair in a fucking knot.  That's right.  Can you make nice with her?  I have no problem.  Why does it make me?  Let's make Dice.  Let's make Dice.  Why am I a problem all the time?  Dice wants to make nice with her. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  Come on.  I think this will work out well.  He's got a point, though.  Oh, wait.  Roland's just making a face.  Oh, no.  What happened, Roland?  The cake was good, Roland.  Thank you.  Yeah.  But you let us all down.  Yeah.  Again?  No.  Roland never lets anyone down.  Aw.  Where is she?  Are they gone?  Let's make nice.  We don't want her to leave.  Where is she?  Where is she?  Tell her Dice wants to make nice.  Yeah, we don't want her to leave.  Come on.  Plus, it's my birthday.  I wasn't rude to her.  I was very nice to her.  We still got a chance to get winners here.  I'm the one who's nice to girls in here.  Of all the guys in here, I'm the nicest to chicks, and they treat me like shit. 
[02:10:00]  Fuck them.  White strippers stink.  You didn't even look at her.  That's why I like trannies.  I should have just thought that and not said it.  I kind of thought it might have been.  You started eating the cake.  You didn't even pay attention.  It was melting.  I was being a gentleman.  I was trying to help you.  Someone left the cake out in the rain.  I don't think that I could make it.  And it took too long to bake it.  I never had that recipe again.  No more.  Goosh.  No, but that was a gentlemanly thing to do.  Like, hey, I'm not making an object out of you. 
[02:10:30]  I'm enjoying a piece of birthday cake.  Right, we were easing into it.  But at least look at her tits now and then since she feels good about it.  That's what I'm fucking mean.  She's probably got them big cow nipples.  You know what I mean?  Yes, I do.  I love that shit.  I do too.  Let's smooth things off.  Big Polish tits.  Instead of when they're like little men nipples.  Yeah, like big tits.  Like a fucking cow when they hang there.  Ugh, shit.  Just splooge up.  Yeah, fuck.  Yeah, big Polish tits.  Who's better than you? 
[02:11:00]  Could you get her in here?  We gotta smooth things off.  I just want to apologize.  Let's turn the lights down.  Let's turn down the surgery lights.  Let's be romantic.  Maybe she took her hair out of the bun.  What's her name again, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Yeah, okay.  Let's do things over with the headquarters girl.  Flamentino, like, introduces us.  I'm sure it's a great club at all.  We'll just meet.  What's her name?  We'll start it all over.  Fran.  Joanna.  Okay.  Jo-Fran.  The lights are down, Dice.  So, let's make nice.  We got a chance to get winners here.  Alright, here we go.  Alright, where is she? 
[02:11:30]  But she went, now what?  Now what?  Making a shit.  Dice, don't care.  Dice.  Be patient.  I can't smoke, but now it's like a ventilation problem.  Here she comes.  Make nice, Dice.  You ready?  You ready for this?  You good?  Everybody be cool.  Alright.  Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Remember, I like Dice cool.  Yeah, I know Dice cool.  Dice cool.  Remember, we want Dice.  Hi.  There it is.  Sure.  We got, we got, we got.  She got headphones or something?  Something.  I need headphones.  Joanna.  This is my friend, Andrew, over here. 
[02:12:00]  Andrew, this is Joanna.  Listen.  Listen.  I'm sorry, what?  Over your fucking head.  I'm trying to be Joanna.  It was Joanna.  He told me your name was Joanna.  It's Fran.  Oh, Fran.  Fran, I'm sorry.  Adrian, you're out.  Adrian, you're out.  Remember?  Yeah.  Don't be an edge.  Why are you doing that?  I told you it was Joanna.  I told you it was even.  I'm not Russian.  Sorry.  He did that.  We knew it was Adrian.  It's Adrian like Rocky.  We knew it.  What's her first name?  Adrian.  Adrian.  It's Adrian, right?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Look, my friends were a little out of line before.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, they sort of put the pressure on me to talk about the bun because they know  I have a thing about that.  I lost many girlfriends over, you know, when they would screw up and go into the bathroom  and put their hair in a knot.  Because it's, you know how, like, you could look all beautiful and go into the bathroom  like Marilyn Monroe and then Marilyn Manson walks out.  You know how that happens?  So when I see a bun, when I see a bun, I get flashbacks of this stupid fuck and I warned 
[02:13:00]  her.  You know, I would say to her all the time, I go, what's with the fucking knot?  Yeah.  Well, I'm washing my face.  You know what?  Don't wash your face.  You put the makeup on your face for a reason.  Yeah.  So you look like a human being.  That's fuckable, right?  And now you come out of there, no fucking makeup, a bun in your head.  You look like my eight-year-old kid.  You know what I mean?  So maybe it was my fault, sweetheart. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  See, that's just apologizing.  It is Norton's birthday.  Maybe I was a little out of line.  Like earlier, I had a fight with Franny.  You know, and that was a misunderstanding.  You know what I mean?  So, uh, so now take your dress off for something for Norton.  It's my birthday and stuff.  It is his birthday.  He's, uh.  Okay.  No, no.  I don't even want her to take a top down. 
[02:14:00]  That's fucking wrong of you guys.  You know what I mean?  I mean, we're in a fucking radio state.  Even if she got undressed.  Yeah.  What's the fucking thrill with nine guys standing around computers?  It's going to get weird real fast.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Like everybody's going to make an excuse to leave or something.  Yeah, you get a chick like this.  You get a loan.  You get her like in a bathroom where there's nobody hanging out.  A bathroom.  So you can.  Well, because we're in a no-law building.  You know, you lock the door.  You get her in a corner a little. 
[02:14:30]  You go, let me see over here now.  You know, putty, putty, putty.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  Nice.  But Dice, we're confused by the topless basketball thing.  Right.  That was a confusing part.  We're very confused.  We thought if you did topless basketball.  Why not?  And you would dance before.  Be topless for Jim Norton's birthday.  Like that.  You could be topless for Jim Norton's birthday.  Yeah, that's the whole thing.  But it's the whole principle of how you ask somebody and don't be rude about it.  That's right.  Oh.  Be respectful.  Be like, oh, I would love to see your great big boobs.  Don't be like, hey, like you're the, you know what I mean? 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  Who did that?  Who did that?  Who did that?  A little bit of this, a little bit of that.  Who did that?  It was a few of us.  What did I say?  Yeah.  What did I say?  It's just people's mannerisms, you know what I mean?  What did I do?  Well, his mannerisms were okay.  It's the way you talk to people.  What did I do?  You're not being very nice.  You get more out.  Wow, Anthony.  Did I do something?  That's right.  I didn't even realize that he was rude, too, right?  I was very polite.  Wait, what did I say?  Or something.  What did I say?  What did I say?  Really?  I want to see some pussy.  What did I say?  No, no, stop.  It's just like the way you talk to people.  My cock's so hard.  Adrian, who was the rude one?  Was it Anthony or was it my friend over here? 
[02:15:30]  I'm just saying in general, when you want something from somebody, be nice.  My buddy used to say, Chip, I don't be rude.  You know what it is, Ethel?  I'm feeling I'm being accused.  I feel like there's an organization here.  I got to say a name to know it.  What's her name?  What is your name?  Adrian.  Ethel.  Just call me Ethel.  No, Adrian's okay.  Why'd you tell me Ethel?  I was thinking of my aunt.  It's Joanna.  It's like, it doesn't matter.  Do you know what does matter?  I don't want to say the wrong name.  Does any of my mannerisms come off as offensive or something?  But he gets told that a lot, though, because when girls come raised. 
[02:16:00]  I do not.  He behaves rudely.  No, you know what it is?  I don't think I did.  You know what it is?  Are you looking at my aunt?  Yes, I am.  Of course I am.  Why else do you have a aunt?  Is that rude?  No, but I admit it.  No, because I acknowledge it and he answered correctly.  He didn't feel like, no.  You know, but the thing is, I'm a guy and she's got a very lovely leg.  You know what?  And I was thinking of her underpants.  Why is she laughing at that?  Of course you are.  A beautiful buxom.  You're a rude guy.  Why don't we just play strip poker and just play? 
[02:16:30]  We don't want a game.  We just want you to take your shot off.  Oh, I'll show my penis, but nobody wants to see it.  It looks awful right now because I have to tinkle.  Ew.  Yeah, I know.  What's it doing?  It's like a twisted pigtail.  It's not good.  But I mean, I would, not that nobody wants to see it, but no winners.  Are your feet dirty?  No winners.  Because Dice doesn't like dirty feet.  No, she's got clean feet.  I can see it right from the get-go.  That isn't an offensive thing.  We were talking about her earlier.  Do you have dirty feet?  No.  She really doesn't like Anthony.  I don't know. 
[02:17:00]  Damn it.  I'm just asking her.  No.  Well, you're covering them up and it's 100 degrees up.  She's got a good point there.  Come on, you got it in here.  No, I have.  It's 100 degrees and you're covering your tits up.  Oh, I came in here with a woven shirt.  That's not how you talk to a lady.  What the fuck do I?  Wow.  We want to see, as Dice is calling them, your big cow nipples.  Oh, man.  I was just making a statement about the female. 
[02:17:30]  You guys have never seen big boobs before?  No.  Yeah, right?  What have you never?  But you don't even know.  But we've also had pizza before.  You know what?  It doesn't stop us from having more pizza.  That's a good point.  You guys deal with girls with probably boobs in B ranges, in your normal, personal way.  Well, usually they're A-cups, you know, they haven't gotten them yet.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You know, the little A-cups.  Wow, you don't think small-breasted women are attractive at all?  You know, I am doing a club tonight.  I've never had small boobs.  Wait a minute.  No. 
[02:18:00]  Shut your mouth a minute when I'm talking.  Dice is performing tonight at Governor's in Leavittown, Long Island.  Two shows, eight at 10.30.  But what I'm saying is, maybe Alexandria here could be sitting in the front row.  I could say something about, you know, the cow nipples.  Right, right, right.  And I'll really make it up to you, because I'm a Megatron star, and people will listen to me.  And if I say, you know, go see Joanna.  No.  I don't know.  She's lying to me about her name. 
[02:18:30]  Adrian.  You know, at the basketball, her and Rodman will be topless.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Maybe Rodman's got to ask nice.  Is Rodman got to ask nice?  Everyone probably does, right?  It's a business.  What is this?  A fucking playroom?  It's a business, too.  We conduct business here.  It's a radio show.  All you guys aren't my teammates or aren't my coach.  But we're here promoting something that you want to promote.  Like it's a real game.  It's quid pro quo.  Well, if you're not basketball, I play somebody one-on-one. 
[02:19:00]  Do you live out on the island?  Yeah.  No, I live in the city.  Literally, tit for tat.  You live in the city.  I live, like, right around here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What happened there?  You can cut it.  What's going on here?  Because I can't get out of it, and I'm not getting in my panties, so I told Jim he can  cut my dress off.  No, don't cut a dress.  That's all wrong.  No, that's not a nice thing to do.  No, I said it's cool.  Wait, we might have winners here today?  That's actually sexier.  That's all wrong.  We might have winners, though.  That is pretty sexy.  We might have winners.  He can cut me out of my dress.  We'll give her that. 
[02:19:30]  We might have winners.  He's going to cut the whole dress off?  No, just like...  The top.  Just the top?  Cut it down?  We might have winners.  Turn down the lights.  We might have winners dice.  Wait a minute.  Sam, what's going on?  Are we going to have winners today?  Are we going to have winners today?  What's going on?  No, I said that you could cut...  You're going to cut her shirt.  Okay, if she's...  Cut her shirt open.  Not all the way off.  And then...  Just like sexy.  Right between the breasts.  Because I have to take it all off.  Right.  Right.  So that'll leave enough room for your shoulders and stuff to get there, right? 
[02:20:00]  Well, Lainey must have...  Go ahead, Norton.  Do your thing.  That's some terrific stuff.  So where am I cutting from?  But do it sexy.  You know what to do.  Come on.  Do Norton.  What about the bun?  We're good with the bun?  Yeah, the bun's fine.  I don't care if she's...  What am I doing?  Jimmy's got scissors.  I don't know.  You tell me.  Where should he cut?  Well, just don't cut my...  Because I have cleavage.  Just show him around the area to cut.  Cut right up through our cleavage.  I got stabbed three times.  I'll start here.  All right.  Now, Jimmy's cutting.  Why are you nervous? 
[02:20:30]  No, because I don't...  It's scissors towards my face.  See, he's not running.  I'm not running with them.  I don't have Down Syndrome.  I'm nice.  I'm standing here.  I know, but if anybody bumps you...  No one's going to bump me.  No one's bump me.  Look where my hand is.  It's blocking the scissors.  Because it's going to go...  No, it's not going to...  That's never happened to you.  Jim, make sure you don't cut the bun.  All right.  Jim was voted the scissor cutting key in.  Why are you so gentle?  You're supposed to be like...  A second ago...  She's a psychopath.  A second ago...  This is what...  How crazy she is.  A second ago, she's fucking turning her head away. 
[02:21:00]  He's going, don't cut me.  And then she goes, why are you so gentle?  What are you...  Well, I mean...  Be the gentleman.  Here it is.  It's very, very nice.  We're back on that thing again.  All right.  There it is.  All right, good.  Now, a little further.  Now you rip it open a little.  What do you think?  Well, he's got to get through the material.  Do Norton.  Okay.  Wait, oh my gosh.  Not too crazy.  She's got to leave here with it.  He's got to make a...  I'm saying.  I'm going to cut your breasts.  Oh, man.  Here we go.  Oh, my gosh.  There's like more people in there.  All right.  Oh, it's okay. 
[02:21:30]  That means you're on a basketball team where there's 20,000 people watching every night.  Well, speaking of basketball, it does look better that way.  Yeah, that looks pretty good.  Yeah, we got winners now.  Now, did I not do a phenomenal, gentle, cutting job?  I also do that when I...  Let him do the ripping if you're going to do more.  What are we ripping here?  I don't know how much.  Can I tell you something?  Oh, look, you do more.  That's nice.  Thank you.  She's got a nice boob job.  She started out with big boobs, but she didn't like...  No, they look natural. 
[02:22:00]  No, it's like...  They do, right?  Nice.  Like in the microwave.  Oh, man.  They're getting bigger.  Yeah.  Oh.  I have to say...  Wow.  Are they nice?  Jimmy's squeezing them.  They are...  Phenomenal.  ...extraordinarily...  No, they feel really real.  They're bouncing.  Thank you so much for this, because, you know, Jimmy was disappointed.  Wow.  This is nice.  This is a nice gift.  This is a nice gift.  Sometimes at the end of heartbreak, there's always something beautiful.  A light at the end of the tunnel, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  That's my fetish. 
[02:22:30]  I love large nipples.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jimmy.  I can't.  I'll show you.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  That's fair.  It's okay.  It's okay.  But what happened?  She doesn't understand it's an honor to show me.  Don't trip and fall.  That's okay.  Jimmy's looking at him now.  No one else can.  Wow.  She has really, really large, thick nipples.  Oh, good.  They're very nice.  Thank you.  Why don't you show me your vag, too, and he can talk about it to us.  Wonderful.  Great for the rest of us.  She's probably embarrassed about her vagina, because a lot of women...  Yeah, not at all.  Native American women typically have larger vaginas. 
[02:23:00]  Do they?  Yes, they do.  They have bigger pussy lips.  It's like a papoose.  No, but I'm saying that in a complimentary way.  No, you know what it is?  It's not that they have that peppercorn in there.  It's like a cornucopia.  Is that what you're saying?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We're establishing something here.  Yes, Jimmy.  Native American women typically do have larger vaginas.  And I mean bigger or thicker.  Am I correct?  I've read that.  You're right.  Like your natural geographic.  Like big lips.  Big lips.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Now, what were you saying no for?  They're big, like they're thick, but not long?  Now, what was I wrong about it?  You almost said I was wrong about something.  No, you're right.  I had to think, but you're right.  Large clitoris?  Yeah.  I'm like, what is this?  It's a good question.  That's what it is.  Wow.  You're being right.  This is an excellent interview.  Damn.  Yeah, Jimmy's doing a great job.  This is the point.  I happen to think that's very sexy.  There's nothing sexier than it.  Some guys like it.  What's that?  Some guys like it.  Some guys don't appreciate it.  Look at them big fucking monkey lips between them legs when they get like that.  How great is that? 
[02:24:00]  Some guys, with the fucking sap coming from the pores.  We're going for winners now, you know what I mean?  We're going for winners now.  We ain't seeing anything.  We ain't seeing anything.  I see, like, the outline.  You know what?  I think him cutting her shirt, that's a winner right there.  Got her there.  Got her there.  Now, are you...  You know what I mean?  It made her feel a little sexy.  Are you visible through your panties or no?  No, there's flowers on them.  No, but can you see the outline normally?  No.  Oh, who are you bullshitting, Sarah?  Come on.  Sarah.  Are you scalped down there? 
[02:24:30]  I don't think she knows what you're talking about.  What are the panties made out of burlap?  I don't think she knows what you're talking about.  No, he wants to know, like, if you're in your underwear, can you see, like, whippage  or something, right?  Are you scalped down there, or does it look like a beaver pelt?  I have a fucking 80s bush, okay?  Nice.  I like that.  You're 18, 18, 80s.  I claim it.  Europeans coming back.  I hope it comes back.  I hope it comes back.  Europeans back.  Let me tell you something.  Do you have hair down there?  They realized that it was great fucking decoration.  Why not?  A little bit.  See, he's happy now.  You can eat them and floss at the same time. 
[02:25:00]  Wait, see, she's saying she's bald down there, Dice.  You know what?  That don't interest me.  I would love to see that.  Do you be partially happy?  Nah.  Could he go under your dress?  It's like an undeveloped box.  Adrian.  Adrian.  Andrew doesn't like it when it's completely shaved.  Because I don't like when it's complete because it's like underdeveloped.  No, I know what you mean.  It's sexy.  It's underdeveloped.  Yeah.  It's like throwing some fucking hair.  A landing strip.  The landing strip.  You know, that's old news.  You got to go more with like a little island.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of island?  What shape?  No, no.  What shape of the island? 
[02:25:30]  You can keep the box lips nice and clean, waxed out, bleach, whatever.  Put it on.  Who gives a shit?  But above, you need the box hair just so a guy's got somewhere to cushion his cock in  between.  But why would you want, why would a guy want his face and like hair?  You know, the excitement of sticking your face in somebody's box.  You know what I mean?  And then you, how big are they?  But let me ask you, do you like a guy like completely shaved down? 
[02:26:00]  Like you got to do like scrubbing before you even go anywhere.  No, serious.  Do you like a guy shaved down or just natural?  Not shaved down, but not like, oh my gosh, like this is disgusting.  I'm totally about it.  Yeah, but how many guys are really that disgusting?  No, guys that shave like this.  Guys, guys.  I shave.  Yeah, I don't want to talk.  You're supposed to be merely.  Men are supposed to have hair, like chest hair.  Exactly.  Not back hair.  Exactly.  You have some wispy, Jimmy.  I have no hair at all.  You have wispy hair on your arm.  I'm like a nude child.  A tall, nude child.  So are your lips really long and thick, or are they just short?  Oh, please.  You can just tell me.  I love that. 
[02:26:30]  I love that.  It makes me very happy.  It's my birthday.  Can Jimmy see your lips?  It looks like buffalo meat drying in the sun.  That would be hot.  I'm just using an Indian analogy.  I happen to like that.  I like when the lips get a little wallady.  I like that.  Wallady.  What do I mean?  Wallady.  Wallady.  You could show them.  When they get that little alligator feel to them, like they've really been through something.  An alligator wallet?  Left out in the sun a little bit? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  They could really take a fucking beating.  You know what I mean?  Take a beating.  Or have they been thrown in the pool?  Would you show me and I would just report to the guys?  It's like you almost want your balls to feel like both of us got to get through that little  hole.  Condoleez-a-rice or something?  Yeah.  That they fight.  Okay.  Did you shoot out right into a fucking box?  Like I'll sit over there.  We need Patron.  And you could show me.  Can you show Jimmy the lips?  Only Jimmy.  I'm very respectful.  I wouldn't.  Yeah.  Jimmy would be the winner.  Sit down?  Yeah.  No, I'll sit down so you can stand in front of me so you don't have to feel like everybody's 
[02:27:30]  looking.  Yeah, just do the pull-away.  Just quickly for Jimmy.  It's a birthday boy.  The panty pull-over?  Yeah.  The panty pull-over for Jimmy Norton for his birthday.  Jimmy, you've got to go over there.  I'll be nice.  And then, you know, I'll be nice.  I've got to go over there, Reddy.  What are you waiting for?  And then we all go home happy.  Take a seat, Jimmy.  And it turns out to be a big misunderstanding.  I've got to have a fucking cigarette.  I'm sweating in this room.  Oh, man.  Now, you don't have to sit.  Jimmy, first birthday.  Jimmy's sitting down.  Get a microphone on Jimmy.  He's got one.  You're going to do a little thong pull-away.  And a thong pull-away for just Jimmy.  So I could see.  Just for Jimmy.  I'm pulling my panties over?  Yeah, so I can look, but I won't touch. 
[02:28:00]  I'm not pulling my panties over.  Why am I sitting here, then?  Maybe if you waited a half a second.  Well, you could do that.  I would like to see.  Give yourself a wedgie.  A pussy wedgie.  Jim, she might have a thing.  Oh, you got your thing?  No, I don't have my thing.  The best part is watching Lainey mime to her.  Just pull him up.  Just pull him up.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Lainey, let me ask you.  Lainey's a pimp.  Lainey, we're good with you, by the way.  You don't have to try so hard.  Now, Lainey, what is going on in your head right now?  You see this as being...  I'm not thinking. 
[02:28:30]  Give her a mic.  Somebody's got a mic there, or no.  You might have the mic.  Mike?  See, I'm not like, you know, it's nothing.  No, but I want to see him.  I'm not going to show Mike.  Why not?  Because that's too much.  What's too much?  You're silly.  Why?  Who cares?  I was promised the legitimate interview.  And there's a lot of kind of behavior going on in here.  I was promised the legitimate interview.  You want us to Charlie Rose, your ass.  This is an unsavory moment.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, Lainey, do you see this as being an appearance that kind of went... 
[02:29:00]  Like, you saw this was about to become a tremendous disaster.  Yes.  Yeah, it was heading down that road.  Well, I've been down that road.  Yeah, you have, Lainey.  But we treat girls who are really cool.  I told her that you guys are great.  We've had a couple run out crying, but, you know, that was a misunderstanding.  Out of all the girls, to have just two or three run out crying...  Honestly...  That's not bad.  You know what went wrong?  No, you're good.  To be honest with you, the fact that Kenny would not let me come in with her...  Oh, boy.  I think, like, she came in alone...  Oh, boy, she's blaming Kenny for this whole thing. 
[02:29:30]  No, but you're...  Kenny's been told...  Here's the thing.  Kenny doesn't know that you...  You're actually one of the ones who can come in.  Kenny doesn't know that.  We told him no publicist.  You're different.  But he's seen me come in with the girls.  It just made me...  Nah, but he's a big joke.  I have to do a do-si-do with him every time I come in.  Oh, wow.  She just has a problem with me.  Wait, first of all, is Laney okay?  I didn't know she was standing there.  Laney, sit down.  You're right, sit down.  What happened to Laney? 
[02:30:00]  Are you okay?  She always has a problem with me and has to mention my name every chance she gets.  Sit down, Laney.  Don't yell at her.  She just got smashed with the door.  The door went right into her back.  Sit down.  He didn't mean to do it.  He can't see it.  Oh, my God.  This is fucking crazy.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Well, that took a turn for the worse.  It got dark.  Yeah.  Is that normal?  Yeah, she okay?  Yeah, but you can't see you coming through the door.  I know.  It was an accident. 
[02:30:30]  Kenny came in like fucking Kramer.  He's a big guy.  That was scary.  All of that weight against the door.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm okay.  Quarantine, a comment?  You got a comment?  It's just fucking...  What a show, huh?  It's like one of Anthony's all relationships.  It's fucking...  It's thought of great, then it's fucking ugly, and then it's all right, and now it's just...  Now it's just fucking weird.  That was just the glass being thrown at me in that jacuzzi.  Yeah.  So does Lainey have a problem with Dice?  With Kenny? 
[02:31:00]  Sorry, Dice.  No, it's just...  I usually come in with the girls, which...  I mean, I've been coming in with the girls for a while, and he stopped me and told me  I couldn't come in, and it's just...  It usually helps a lot if someone's new to the show to see them just sitting there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it always works, and...  Watch that door.  It might swing open on you.  Once before, he, like, didn't...  You know, for some reason, when he's there, he doesn't want me to come in.  It's crazy.  I don't know.  Is your back okay?  I'm okay.  Man, you took a fucking hit. 
[02:31:30]  I'm okay.  We're gonna have to build back up to the pussy.  I don't know how we do that at this point.  I can't believe it's turned to violence.  That's what I mean.  If you would have done the legitimate interview, none of this would have happened.  The big Charlie Rose thing, you know.  We need Charlie Rose.  Now I gotta feel bad.  People are getting hurt, and, you know, their clothes ripped off.  Scissors and doors being thrown.  Yeah, there was a lot of weird stuff there.  Clothes were cut off with scissors, and... 
[02:32:00]  Man.  Lainey's a trooper because she kind of made that happen.  Like, I know you didn't really want to do that.  No, I wanted to do it.  Yeah, we want to thank...  I told her I don't feel comfortable taking it off, but I'll...  Why are you not comfortable taking it off?  Honestly, are you insecure?  Is that why there's a little insecurity?  No, I just felt like...  You got a bad scar?  No, I don't have scars.  No.  Well, we're trying to find out why.  That's all.  Got to ask the question.  I just feel like, you know, some things are, like, sexier, not, like...  Yeah, in a radio station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:32:30]  You go home with the guy.  It's his birthday.  You said that before.  You're right.  Yeah, that's what you're doing.  What are you going to do here?  I swear...  He's going to see the boobs, the box, the whole fucking nine yards.  You know, but yet he can't lay the pipe because we're standing in a place that's surrounded.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony with TVs on, lights, cameras, surgery.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to say something.  Yeah.  Probably one of the best Dice appearances ever.  Ever.  Today.  Dice, you're fucking hilarious. 
[02:33:00]  Ever.  Well, I'm trying to help a lot of people.  I know you're trying to help, and that's what you do.  You helped a lot of people.  You helped people.  I think there's a lot of winners.  Holy shit.  I feel bad for Lanny.  You know.  What about Ethel?  Hold on.  No, no.  Kenny's going to feel bad that he hit it with the fucking door.  No, he's not.  Dice, listen.  Listen.  Careful.  But then again, how bright is she?  She's standing in front of a fucking door.  Has she ever gone through one before?  You know what I mean, boy?  Oh, let me stand in front of a solid metal door so the biggest guy in the building can 
[02:33:30]  smack it into my back.  He makes a good point.  She should have moved out of the fucking way a half hour ago.  You're right, Dice.  I don't stand in front of doors without windows.  I said something to play the tape back.  Never.  Never.  You're right.  Dice, listen to me.  You're right, Dice.  I swear to you, we got to go because we're running a ton of God at Fez time, even though  the clock says differently, but we got a lot of shit we have to get in by 11.  Yeah, do what you got to do.  So why don't you tell everyone who the winners are today and the losers?  How you see it.  Is the show like the show?  Is Jim Gordon a winner for being his birthday and how that worked out? 
[02:34:00]  Well, he's a winner and, you know, with a little pressure and, you know, my finesse,  we got her tits out of a shirt.  So she's a winner.  You're finesse?  Yeah.  Remember when you were yelling at her?  I said, you got to chill out.  You got to charm the chick.  Oh, I like how your box lips look, drew your pants, things like that.  We're all cool now, right?  That's right.  Yeah, we're fine now.  Because when that argument was going on, there was no chance of never seeing anything.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all right.  Hey, you know, is she a winner now that she showed her tits? 
[02:34:30]  She's a winner, she's a champ.  Okay, good.  Thank you.  So she don't play the games.  I had a great time.  You know, once she was relaxed and no doubt.  Happy birthday, Jimmy boy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Is Lainey a winner for taking a door in the back?  Lainey took a door in the back.  Winner, winner.  You know what?  She's sitting there.  She's laughing.  Obviously, she's not hurt.  She's good.  Obviously, there's no lawsuit because she's sitting there laughing, having a great time  again.  Oh, boy.  So she don't get a fucking nickel.  You know how much we're going to have?  We're going to owe her a lot now. 
[02:35:00]  Jim Florentine.  She now has the upper hand.  Fuck!  Jimmy Florentine.  Jimmy Two Bulls.  Married.  Jimmy's been great.  Beautiful wife.  Beautiful kid.  The winner of the week, I'd have to say, right?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Winners?  Definite winners.  Oh, thank you, guys.  They're doing so good.  I feel like the studio feels bigger this time.  It does, right?  It's a nice-sized studio.  I don't know if it's the way you lit it.  It's a little small.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM. 
[02:35:30]  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  I'm still embarrassed from yesterday.  Why?  What happened?  Oh, I told you guys in the car about the...  Oh, God.  When I read that, I'm just like...  What?  Read it?  I told you in person.  Well, reading it is a different thing, because then you see other people's reactions.  Wait, what?  You were howling.  You were laughing so hard.  Oh, okay.  I just didn't know what you meant.  After yesterday's show, after the Donald Sutherland interview, we were all feeling good 
[02:36:00]  and all, and I got in the elevator by myself.  I lost you guys, and I decided, wow, man, that went so well.  Yeah.  And then I decided to go for a pick.  Oh, boy.  A deep pick.  I was in the elevator.  It's a long ride down the lobby.  No pick.  I decided to go for a nice pick.  Yeah.  Thinking about the Donald Sutherland interview.  Does that give you physical pleasure?  Is that how you reward yourself for a good interview? 
[02:36:30]  Is that how you're doing?  With a good nose picking?  You're digging your nose after a successful interview?  I'm just trying to wrap up the story.  No, I do not do that, actually.  But I found my finger in my nose.  Let's just put it that way.  And then all of a sudden, I feel the elevator slurring.  Was it just in the beginning of the nose?  Oh, no.  I was digging, man.  You were way up there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was some coverage in there.  I had to remove.  And all of a sudden, I feel the elevator kind of slowing down, which should have been a  clue that it's stopping on another floor.  And I'm in the elevator by myself. 
[02:37:00]  Doors open.  I swear to you, I'm fucking deep in my right nostril.  And the doors open.  And probably the hottest girl that works in this building is waiting to get on the elevator.  I wrote in my tweet a supermodel.  She was pretty much close to a supermodel.  I thought it was Fez.  See, I'm kidding.  And she stares at me in complete and utter disgust.  Of course.  I was mortified.  Of course.  She gets on the elevator.  Then I'm thinking, do I go for a joke?  Do I try to fucking get myself out of this shit? 
[02:37:30]  There's no joking your way out of that.  No, why?  Because she immediately turned around, didn't want anything to do with me and my fucking  nose picking, and just stared at the elevator door about a foot away from the door.  Should have wiped it on her back.  Yee.  You should have went, mmm.  Like the yummy sound.  And then it was the longest ride down in the fucking lobby.  Yeah.  Oh, it was horrendous.  I felt like a fucking idiot.  What an idiot. 
[02:38:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  You want to put a burger in my mouth?  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  Do you want to eat mine?  But, yeah, that happened yesterday.  Yeah.  That was a real moment.  It was humiliating.  I have to address another tweet of yours.  What did I do?  What did I do?  You have to be honest.  Do you do this?  What happened?  You said, retweet if you also...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  If you also...  I did well with that tweet. 
[02:38:30]  ...clean the piss off of the toilet seat with your socked foot.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  Now, please elaborate on this, because no one I know does this.  You're lying.  No, you're lying.  This was something that you presented like, oh, everyone does this.  And I was like, I know no one.  I wanted to know, and a lot of people said, hell, fucking yeah.  No fucking way.  Dude, I'm not talking if you just spray the entire scene and it's a complete mess, 
[02:39:00]  because I don't know what the fuck happens.  Because, you know, a little couple drops, yeah.  There's toilet paper right there.  I don't feel like bending down.  I got herniated discs.  I use toilet paper, never my sock.  A sock, but then you're walking around with piss foot.  No, because it's not, like, soaked.  It doesn't matter, even a little trace.  It's a couple drops, so I'll lift up my foot and just do a quick little wipe.  With my sock.  Never.  Not every fucking time.  No, never, actually.  Never.  Not every time. 
[02:39:30]  But you're walking on, like, your floors and your rug or something.  I guarantee if I took off my sock, you wouldn't even know I did it.  I'm not sopping up, like, gallons of piss.  There's a couple little drops that hit the seat or something.  Do you hit the floor when you piss?  Like, do you look in front?  Like, I always look in front of the seat.  I guess I spray, and there's always something on the floor.  Oh, God, no.  What's going on there?  I always hit the floor, too.  Why?  I don't know.  That's why you've got to just lay it right in the toilet.  Like a pipe.  Yeah, mine's big enough. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, of course it is.  I'm being called a fucking animal.  What is called a deep two?  A fucking animal.  I'm being called a fucking animal now.  When I read that, I'm like, I don't know one person.  Yeah, but I knew you.  That does that.  I knew you didn't do it, because you're really strange with fucking bodily fluids.  I do use toilet paper.  Sometimes it's quick and easy.  I do use toilet paper.  What if it's not a fresh sock?  What if it's a sock you've been hanging with all day anyway?  Your chick has to fucking do the laundry.  She's got to pick up a piss sock.  Well, that's point Opie, then.  That makes me want to do it. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you.  You want to go to the phones?  All right.  I got my people.  You got your people.  I got my people.  All right.  My people are different than your people.  This guy says he uses the knee of his jeans.  Oh, God damn, no.  I'm telling you.  Come on.  Well, logically, the toilet paper's there, but sometimes you're already up high, so you  just take your foot, and you don't want to leave anything on the seat for anybody else.  Up high?  It's right there.  It's barely.  It's probably right even with your hand. 
[02:41:00]  And then you got to bend down maybe a foot.  I got lower back problems at times, bro.  Too much?  Too much sometimes.  I do what my sock and my bare foot, this guy's saying.  Oh, God.  Do you want these guys, or do you want me just to read what they're saying?  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Here's a guy totally old.  My chick caught me sock wiping the toilet rim just the other day and shit a brick.  This is the first time you're hearing of this, by the way?  First time, and I swear to you.  First time I've ever heard of this.  Ever.  They're calling me archaic.  It's never occurred to me. 
[02:41:30]  I've done everything with piss you can do.  Right.  Literally everything, frozen it.  Scott and Quagertown.  Now, wait, Jimmy lets girls shit on his chest, allegedly, I don't know, and is afraid of  a little piss on his sock?  That's the beauty of me.  All right, good.  Hence the irony of my life.  Because we got all the info out.  I would just think you'd be...  That's the first time you heard of that.  And what if you do it more than once in a day?  Then it's...  No, no.  Then you're getting a lot of piss on the sock.  I'm not...  No, I'm not a...  No.  No.  Every once in a while is what I'm saying, and that's for real. 
[02:42:00]  I've never heard of it.  And yeah, sometimes I will use the toilet paper, but sometimes I'm just up there.  There's a little drop or two, and I go, yeah, fuck, and just take my sock foot and just  fuck it.  Usually my right, by the way, if you need to know.  Sometimes if I notice...  That's why all my socks have a whole...  Yeah?  If I notice the seat...  Because the seat goes up.  So the rim, not even the seat.  If I notice the rim is getting a little, you know, dirty, like dried up little blotches  there and whatnot. 
[02:42:30]  Well, if you don't use your foot and you don't wipe it off, sometimes you come back in and  take another piss, and the rim itself has...  But that's more disgusting that you don't wipe it off at all.  No, no, it's not.  Because then you...  I've never had dried piss on my home seat.  You kind of spray a little bit on it to loosen it up, and then you take the toilet paper and  wipe it off, using it like an ammonia kind of cleaner.  No, I use toilet paper to wipe it off.  Look, they're across the board, but I do have...  I use the knee of my jeans.  We said that.  Knee of the jeans?  I use my sock if I do it on the floor. 
[02:43:00]  What?  I do it with my sock and my bare foot.  Opie's the man.  Yeah, I am the man.  This is craziness.  Thank you, friend DC.  That is fucking disgusting.  I do it all the time.  So far, one out of ten is saying it's disgusting, and then I got nine guys that are saying they  do it too.  Yeah.  I'm not talking like...  You don't have to be.  I don't even...  You don't have to talk any more than a couple of drops.  I just think it's...  The nose thing, that's bad.  Put a little sock foot on the toilet seat every once in a while is... 
[02:43:30]  Stop doing gross things with your extremities.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  Take better care of your toes and fingers.  Snot on the fingers, piss on the feet.  Exactly.  I use chimp.  I use boxers and socks.  Oh, my God.  You got to hear from these people.  Let's go to Mike in Hoboken.  I'm just amazed you've never heard of this before.  Never.  Never even a fucking glimmer that that might be going on.  You never even thought about it?  Never thought about it for a second.  Wow, that's weird, I think. 
[02:44:00]  It's probably weird I do it, but it's weird that you never even heard of this before.  Never.  I don't know anybody that's done this.  Yellow.  Mike.  Yes.  I'm with Opie.  Now, we're not talking huge puddles of pits on the seat.  We're talking little tiny droplets, and if my back hurts, I just dip my knee onto the  seat and swipe it clean, fellas.  Yes.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  That's where you lose me.  No, I know I wouldn't use my jeans.  You wear dirty sweats.  Who are you kidding?  No, I do smell the seat of my fucking jeans to see if I can get another day out of them. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, my God.  That was going to be the next week, by the way, of my new...  Do they really stink?  What?  Do the jeans will smell?  If you wear them a few days in a row.  And I do a lot of walking around.  I'm sitting in the seat for five hours.  Sure, it could stink.  You're in dirty cabs?  Of course.  How many days do you wear your jeans?  I'll wear them four days in a row.  It will never smell.  The ass on my jeans never stings.  One day.  You're a one-day...  One day.  What's wrong with you?  And it goes in the fucking laundry. 
[02:45:00]  Why?  Because...  You could easily get two days.  But why if I don't have to?  True.  Like, I could put it in...  Now, why?  Because the second day, my jeans feel a lot better.  They feel a little stiff the first day.  They loosen up a little bit, and they just feel better.  No, I just...  I don't know.  One day, I take them off.  One day?  I think that's weird.  No, because I can.  Because, like, you know, Ange comes over.  She does the laundry. 
[02:45:30]  But it wears out your clothes faster.  All that washing.  That's all right.  I guess I've got to realize I have money.  It's not like fucking...  You know, she's not out banging them on a rock in a river.  It's a modern washing machine.  I've got to start realizing I've got money, I guess.  Yeah, it's just kind of, you know...  This is all old school shit.  When I couldn't do laundry, of course you wore your jeans four or five days in a row.  Of course you did.  Hope he needs ShamWow socks.  Oh, Bob Kelly does a bit on wiping the sea with his sock?  No way!  Does he? 
[02:46:00]  And if he does, please find him for the break.  Well, he's a fucking animal.  Yeah, that's because he can't...  If he bends over, he might fall like a lamb and not be able to get off his stomach or back.  That's true.  You know what, dude?  You take your foot, you swipe it, boom.  You put your shoes back on.  Oh, God.  Now I'm being called a Nancy boy, old lady faggot because I wear socks in my home.  Are you kidding me?  A lot of people wear socks in my house.  I don't wear my shoes in my house.  I don't wear shoes in the house, but of course I wear socks.  I like sliding around on the marble floor.  Somebody tweeted, I let my wife's ass wipe it off the next time she tingles. 
[02:46:30]  What's better than when your chick sits in your piss?  Jesus, that's just not right.  See, that's why I use my socks.  Oh, that's fantastic.  There's nothing better.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  That's it.  There's nothing better than a girl sitting in your piss.  Pick a seat up in your piss.  I sat down here.  I sat in your fucking piss.  Oh, there was a gun.  Good.  I'm also being called a filthy animal because I just don't lift the seat up. 
[02:47:00]  Sometimes, like, my aim's good.  Maybe a drop or two gets on the seat.  I'm like, ah, fuck.  And then I take my sock foot and sure.  Don't you hate touching the bottom rim?  I hate touching under the rim.  Oh, never.  And then you see that fucking whatever the original lip is before you put the seat down.  That's got shit caked on it from the 80s.  So I'm fucking really careful with that.  You're going to fire hose that.  Darren, does Robert Kelly have a bit on this?  Hello?  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[02:47:30]  Does Robert Kelly have a bit on this?  I'm not helping him.  No, Robert Kelly did a bit on it on stage.  I've seen him do it like two or three times.  What's the bit?  He does exactly what you said.  He pisses on the rim of the seat in the middle of the night.  Wow, we got something in common.  I've seen Bob Kelly a lot.  Wow, okay.  He did it at the Virus store and I've seen him do it at Caroline's and a few other places.  You've seen him do it?  You might want to ask him where he can get it.  He's probably just doing one of his albums or something.  Yeah, man.  You're walking around with basically a rag on your foot.  You could do all sorts of shit with that sock foot. 
[02:48:00]  Just put fucking strap Kotex on the bottom of your feet.  Look, if you drop something on the floor, like maybe, I don't know, like I'm pouring a lot of milk these days because of my son.  And if a couple drops go on the floor, I'll do the same thing.  Oh my God, you got milk and pee and ketchup.  As long as it's not a lot, yeah, I'll just wipe it, you know, just kind of rub my foot over shit.  Not shit, not shit.  Oh my God.  See, yeah, this guy does it on the, and you're going to lose on this one today. 
[02:48:30]  I don't, I don't.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I'm a, I'm a big guy and I, uh, I kind of sprinkle a little bit and I use my sock all the time.  I don't want to hear the white bitch at me about it.  Well, use toilet paper and fucking wipe it.  I'm too lazy to bend over to get that toilet paper.  It's a little quicker if you just pick up that sock foot in, I'm telling you.  That's crazy.  Hey, listen, don't get your whack off yet.  You use your sock to clean up sometimes.  I don't do that.  No, that I don't do.  When I was a kid.  Nah, man, that always freaked me out using socks and shit. 
[02:49:00]  I would, I would always prepare ahead of time, get the toilet paper or tissues or something.  Yeah, yeah.  I never used a shirt or a fucking sock.  I always thought that was fucking gross.  If you're in a gas station or something like that on a long road trip and they're out of fucking toilet paper,  I've used my undies.  For what?  To wipe.  I think you just throw them away.  Well, you got to do something.  Oh my God.  You could get away with going commando.  So you could do that trick once.  It's like having a fucking engine go out on a 767. 
[02:49:30]  You're okay, but you can only, you know, you can only lose one.  I don't know if I've ever done that.  I'm trying to, I don't think I have.  No?  Nah.  Well.  It's the emergency fucking procedure.  You got to improvise, adapt, overcome, hoorah.  Yeah, you got to just kind of like get your...  It's a Semper Fi wipe.  You got to just, you got to open your asshole in such a way where you hope it doesn't get dirty.  Well, that's just it.  You got to wipe.  You got to get it looking like an opera singer.  Oh!  Uh, here's the guy with the bare foot, eh? 
[02:50:00]  Called J.G.  Wentworth.  Look at you, fucking opera shit.  Yes?  What happened?  Good morning, Bill.  Hey, uh, yeah, I don't know why.  I just, I saw it as logical, but I'm standing there.  See some pee.  Lift up my foot.  Regardless of whether or not I have a sock on there, and I wipe it.  And then my wife sees me, and she totally wigs out.  As well she should.  Nah, it's just piss.  I mean, sipping stuff all the time was the big deal.  And the best thing is, I don't wash my foot, I walk around the house barefoot afterwards. 
[02:50:30]  Who cares?  See, that's, you lose me with the bare foot.  Yeah.  Because you're just smearing the pee now.  At least the sock foot will soak it up.  I am fucking baffled here.  It's just pee.  Don't you worry that it's going to, at some point, get on your rug when you're walking around?  I'm talking, seriously, it has to be just a little.  It doesn't matter.  If there's a lot of damage, then I'm going to take the toilet paper.  And clean it properly.  And when I get the dude, I'm just too goddamn lazy to reach over the one foot and bend over 
[02:51:00]  my fat stomach to get the friggin' toilet paper.  The friggin' toilet paper's right there.  See, I didn't, I didn't, I'm just surprised you didn't know this was going on here.  That's all.  I had no clue.  You know, you learn something new every day.  That's fucking disgusting.  I do it all the time.  I'm being called the disgusting fuck.  Oh my goodness.  Let's hope he put more stress on his back, wiping it off, than using paper.  Yeah, you're on one leg.  You're like a fucking stork.  This guy uses boxes. 
[02:51:30]  Go Pelican.  Go ahead, Dave.  Fly Pelican.  Fly Pelican.  Look, he's picking up his piss with his foot.  Yeah.  They're going to put the sock back in his shoe.  Dave, South Carolina.  Oh, Pete.  Yeah, man, I'm with you.  I use my sock, and then after I get out of the shower, I use my boxers and my white feet  to clean the baseboards.  My chicks do fucking lazy to do it.  Get it done every time you get out of the shower.  You wipe down your baseboards?  Yeah, the fucking cubic hair and all the other shit that's laid at the bottom. 
[02:52:00]  What the fuck?  These chicks are doing the laundry.  Chicks are doing the laundry.  They don't touch anything.  What?  Yeah, throw it in the laundry and be done with it.  Fuck it.  I got some minority that does my laundry anyway, so fucking a fucking big hazardous waste bag.  Oops, fired.  So fired.  Oh, my God.  Let's get some people agreeing with Anthony, please.  Someone in D.C.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, I'm just glad finally there's something I agree with you about. 
[02:52:30]  It's gnarly.  Gnarly.  Yeah, that just seems a little much.  I've never heard of it.  It's wrong.  It's like two steps away from being like, you know, a hoarder with diapers in the corner.  Do you think?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I've watched hoarders and it's kind of a, you know, iffy situation.  You think?  Shit in the bathroom or piss on your socks.  Just a little.  I don't know.  I know what you're saying.  It's just a couple drops.  Just a couple drops.  But that's even too much.  That's even too much.  Just a couple drops.  That's too much. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  I did it at the in-laws' house over the weekend in Philly.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  I want to make sure the seat's properly, you know, wiped down.  Oh, God.  No.  And my socks are nice and thick.  I keep my socks nice and thick.  I think I don't know who else's fucking goop is on there.  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  That's not my, uh...  I don't roll like that, yo.  No.  You know what bit we should play?  Bob Kelly's bit on the fucking socks.  Oh, we could do that, but it reminds me of Jay Moore's bit, which is one of my favorite 
[02:53:30]  Jay Moore bits of all time, and I don't think he does it much these days.  I love that one.  Somebody's correcting me.  What?  If a man spills his seed on your belly, you use your tongue to wipe it up, faggot.  Our listeners are just mean to us.  I know.  Jay Moore's magic soap.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good bit.  He's in the shower, the family soap, and the entire family's using it to fucking clean  armpits, their fucking big, hairy muffs, their assholes, and you're just assuming that the 
[02:54:00]  soap's okay.  Yeah.  You don't even question what the person did with the soap before you.  Yeah, he's saying, like, uh...  It fits great.  You think of the last place you wash, and the first place you wash, and then you come  in and just use the soap.  Yeah, your mom's washing out her hairy fucking muff, and you get in next, and you wash your face  right away.  That's why I use a Worsh cloth.  Do you Worsh with a Worsh cloth?  I use a Worsh cloth.  I think that's why you just put soap on your face and help wash the muff.  You know, straighten.  Flop, flop, flop.  Cuss down on soap. 
[02:54:30]  You look like a rabid dog.  Yeah, you guys don't understand.  This guy, I agree with him, Joe and Jersey.  Piss is sterile.  Yeah, whatever.  It really is.  Yeah, it's fine.  Weren't we going to drink piss on our show?  It smells like piss.  And then what happened?  Piss smells like piss.  What happened?  We weren't allowed to drink the piss on the show?  Yeah, they don't like us doing things like that.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, there you go, man.  You started something.  Well, I definitely want to hear the Bob Kelly bit, because I want to hear his take. 
[02:55:00]  This guy wants me to sit down on the toilet.  Do you change your tampon with a sock, too?  Change the tampon?  I love that fucking cross-section drawing on the back of the tampon boxes, where she's  got her foot up on the toilet, just pushing the little applicator in.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  And they show, like, that cross-section, like she was cut in half with a samurai sword.  Whoosh.  What side is this?  How many times?  Remember when you used to have to grab something to read, though, when you took a dump like 
[02:55:30]  that, and sometimes you didn't have any reading material, and I would grab anything that was  close to the toilet.  Of course.  And sometimes it was a tampon box, because you've got to read when you dump it.  It's just some kind of Pavlovian thing that you need to do to get the shit moving.  And I would just grab anything.  And sometimes it was a tampon box, and I'd be like, oh, look at that, the applicator.  Now, use that.  And then the toxic shock fucking warning and everything.  Now, though, you go in, and you got your iPhone, and you're just fucking tweeting, checking 
[02:56:00]  emails, stocks.  Even on the toilet, you're just...  All that shit.  Same shit.  It's amazing.  Here's the Robert Kelly bit.  I swear I don't remember this bit, but good enough.  Let's go.  She also gets mad.  This is another she gets mad.  She gets mad when I go to the bathroom, because sometimes I dinkle on the seat.  Whatever.  You know, not the whole time, like an ass.  Just ha, ha, ha.  I hate you.  I am the piss god. 
[02:56:30]  It's just a couple drippy drops at the end, you know, when you get a shake.  But I really can't see my pay use, so I just...  I assume it went in.  I don't have time to do this.  When she gets mad, just pick up the seat.  No.  This aggravated me.  She actually got a poem to help remind me to wipe the seat when I'm done.  It says, she put it right over the toilet.  It says, if you sprinkle when you tinkle, be a sweetie and wipe the seedy.  That made me so mad, I wanted to pee in her pocketbook. 
[02:57:00]  Just fill it up.  Hey, honey, you got a poem for this?  I don't need a poem to help remind me, okay?  I'm fine.  If I want to wipe the seat, I have socks on.  He'd love to make that motion right now if he could.  This is two bobs ago.  The girls don't like that joke.  But the guys are like, he's a genius.  Did you hear that?  He just made his foot into a Swiffer, dude.  He has great tits and he's funny. 
[02:57:30]  I love this guy.  Wow, so he does it, too.  I didn't know that.  He wouldn't have said it if he didn't do it.  Of course.  He does it.  Yeah.  I've never heard of this.  I'm enlightened and disgusted all at the same time.  Why are you freaked out by bodily functions?  Because they're bodily functions.  Obviously, they're gross.  But even your own bodily functions, you seem to be freaked out.  I have a hierarchy of disgust relating to anything that comes out of the human body. 
[02:58:00]  And my own, also.  What's the worst one for you?  The worst one, the one that gives me the most heebie-jeebies, but this is on your own body.  Yeah, yeah.  Because other shit will always drive you nuts.  It annoys me the most, also, is snot.  I have such an aversion to mucus and boogers and any snotty thing.  When I blow my nose, it's a fucking procedure that I have to be in front of a mirror when I do it  and make sure every bit I take the tissue when I'm done blowing my nose 
[02:58:30]  and wad it up and put it in there and twist it around and make sure everything's got to be out of there.  Why is it?  And I can't look at it.  I pull it out and I feel one coming out and I'm like, I won't look.  I'll kind of look in the mirror so it's at a distance, make sure I have it,  and I'll quickly fold the tissue over and crumble it and put it in the garbage.  I can't look at snot.  It makes me, it's disgusting.  You're missing the little joys in life, you know that, right?  No, that ain't a joy.  Sometimes you look at that fucking toilet paper or that tissue  and you get very impressed by what you're capable of doing. 
[02:59:00]  I cannot deal with snot.  Do you eat a booger and get it on the top of your teeth?  Oh, you have, though, right?  You've got to stop this.  I have.  You've got to stop this.  Sometimes I have to floss my teeth after I eat boogers.  I can't even imagine eating one.  I've gotten them on the top of the teeth, never in between them,  but literally in the back teeth I've got a booger.  Sometimes they'll stick to the teeth in and then you've got to take your nail  and you've got to kind of scrape your own booger off your front teeth.  No. 
[02:59:30]  What are you doing?  I don't want to listen.  I'm going to fucking.  You're earmuffing.  You're earmuffing.  That is so disgusting.  No, snot to me is, I'm completely disgusted by it.  And then I guess in second place, coming in a close second would be shit.  Shit second to snot?  Yeah, because you don't really have to.  Shit is disgusting.  I just assumed that would be everyone's number one.  No, because you're not handling shit.  You're not really seeing other people's shit. 
[03:00:00]  You're not, you know, other people will pick their nose or blow their nose and show you the fucking thing.  I don't see other people's shit, really, unless you walk in a stall and it's there, and that's disgusting.  Do you ever have a finger pop through the toilet paper?  During what?  Wiping?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Probably years ago when I was a kid, maybe.  But now I make sure I wad the paper up in a certain fashion where there's no accidents can happen.  No accidents can happen.  What's this about, Jimmy?  I just don't want shit on my finger.  What a wacky guy I am.  I don't want my stink finger. 
[03:00:30]  Because that doesn't come off.  That's true.  No one wants that.  I'm just asking if it ever happened.  It's like Pepe Le Pew.  You could shampoo him and everything, but that stink fume little thing will wave over.  That is terrible.  What's number three?  Number three.  It's not over shit.  Yeah.  That's really surprising.  Number three, coming in at number three, we have vomit.  I don't like vomit.  Yeah, vomit's got to be number three.  Yeah, vomit's brutal.  And then what?  Four is pee?  And then four would be piss. 
[03:01:00]  And then five would be your cum?  I don't have a great aversion to piss, believe it or not.  I just think it's odd to put it on your sock and then walk around your house with it because  of the smell alone, I would think.  Now, I know you're saying it's just a drop or two and it doesn't affect anything.  Yeah.  But in my own mind.  I would love to pump this up and say I'm soaking up like a lot of urine with my sock,  but that's not the case here, sir.  Well, in my own mind, I just can't get past the point of it being on the bottom of my  sock and then walking around the house or getting up on the couch and your foot being 
[03:01:30]  on the couch.  Where are you at with earwax?  Earwax is fucking disgusting.  Do you check it out after you wipe your ears?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I make sure, you know.  No, but I mean, do you look at the Q-tip and go, wow, look at this.  No, no, no.  Look what I got today.  Again, I will just throw it away.  You never go, look what I got today?  I'll look to make sure I got some.  These are the joys of life.  And see when it's clean, but I'll throw it away pretty quickly.  I won't ponder it.  You won't?  Yeah.  And go, wow.  Yeah.  And by the way, all bets are off during sex. 
[03:02:00]  Like, then everything goes.  I'll lick an ass.  I'll fuck it.  Yeah, then I don't care.  I'll lick where the piss comes out of.  I don't care.  I don't even fucking give a shit.  But when it comes to sex, all bets are off.  I'm good.  This guy agrees with you about snot.  Nothing better than.  Let me go to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey, go ahead. 
[03:02:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I love, especially when I get a night in this season,  a nice allergy season, going to the shower after a long night's sleep  and putting a nice big fucking air hockey right in my hand.  Oh, God.  What?  An air hanky right in his hand.  I totally can relate to this.  When you're in the shower and you've got to blow your nose,  and you know you've got a lot of action in there.  No fucking way.  Instead of just blowing a snot rocket in the shower,  not on the wall or anything,  you could obviously aim it toward the drain so it would be nice and clean. 
[03:03:00]  I will do it right into my hand to see what I get.  It's like Christmas.  Yeah, you look at it like a fucking eye.  And then you put your hand under the shower  and watch it just kind of like go away.  I can't.  I can't even.  You ever sneeze and get some on the fucking...  Have you ever sneeze and see like a flick on the wall?  Like a piece of blood booger on the wall?  Blood booger!  Right into my hand.  No, I mean from a sneeze or something.  Like you don't mean to.  Yeah.  Well, you fucking blogged on that many times.  I was never...  I'm with this guy.  I'll do a hand hanky.  Bopey.  Yes.  God damn it! 
[03:03:30]  What?  Sam!  It's earwax.  What, Mike?  It's a blood booger.  Everything you know, get a nice big one  and put it in your ear for later.  In your ear?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You know, I can't...  Sam.  You lost...  It's earwax, dude.  I'm just gonna come over there  and smash that computer.  Nice.  Look at it.  It's a big fucking blood...  Why is it bloody?  It's earwax.  It's earwax.  It's not bloody.  What's the red part?  It's probably a shadow.  It's dark when it...  Oh, really?  It's dark.  Mine looks like peanut butter sometimes.  It's because it's hit the oxygen.  What?  Oh, God. 
[03:04:00]  It's because it's hit the oxygen.  When earwax is deep in your ear,  it's like black  and then once it gets more closer to the edge  where it hits more oxygen,  it gets lighter.  When can you make a candle out of it?  But, like, this is deep and hard.  Like, that's like having a rock in your ear.  Ansel, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You don't like earwax either?  Way deep back in the canal.  No, I don't like anything  that comes out of the fucking body.  This guy wants to know,  Ed, if you've ever jerked off while driving.  Oh, see?  No, no.  I've never jerked off while driving.  That's fucking crazy.  That's a fucking adventure. 
[03:04:30]  Waited to happen.  How can you concentrate on anything?  Well, I mean, it's a long ride  from Long Island to Buffalo  and Rochester, New York.  Stop at a rest stop  and get yourself a blowjob  from some gentleman.  Absolutely.  Why do you think they make drills  with batteries in there?  A nice hole saw.  Your legs go stiff like...  Oh, my God.  It's an adventure.  You've never done that either?  No, I've never jerked off driving.  These are little joys.  That just doesn't seem like anything that...  These are little joys  that you're missing out on.  Look at this earwax.  It's got the peanut butter around it, 
[03:05:00]  but then it's got the dark...  I can't fucking look at any of that.  Solid chunk of earwax.  Thank God for the mic flags  because I could put it right there  and not have to look  at your computer screen.  I could just move.  Look.  I'm bobbing and weaving, Sam.  For the new listeners,  because this guy's questioning this,  so maybe he just heard this.  Let's ask your questions.  And actually did toss out a couch  because of one booger.  Yes, a kid wiped a booger on it.  That is a true story.  I couldn't find it.  He couldn't find it.  He was looking for it. 
[03:05:30]  And they were like,  oh, you know, I can't find it.  And the kid's laughing  and his father's just like,  oh, well, oh.  I was like, that's it.  Get this fucking...  I wanted to show Bob Kelly this video.  I'm not watching.  The other day  and I couldn't find it.  I'm not watching.  It's weird.  Oh, just look at it.  It's not that good.  It's called  Guy Gets Nose Professionally Picked.  I don't need to watch that.  And it's subtitled  Wait For It.  Wait for this.  I'm not waiting for anything.  I'm not watching it.  Please watch.  I'm not going to watch it. 
[03:06:00]  Please watch.  Nope.  Doctor's in there.  Nope.  Why would a guy have to do that?  Look at how much comes out  of his fucking...  See, I'm not watching.  That's an oyster.  That looks like a tuna.  And it was as big as an oyster.  No joke.  Look at that.  Oh, great.  Look at that.  Can you please look at it?  How could he not?  I wonder if that's post-surgery.  And for the show.  For the show,  can you please look at it?  Please.  Can you imagine eating that?  Go back.  Go back.  Yeah, just...  You gotta look at it for a second, dude.  It's...  For the show.  For the show.  It's more...  It doesn't even look like a booger.  It's bizarre.  It's...  It's the size of an oyster. 
[03:06:30]  Don't try to talk it down.  Please.  Just go fast forward a little bit  so he doesn't have to watch the whole thing.  And please look.  It looks like it's fake.  For the show.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Doctor's in there with his, like,  tweezer-y things,  whatever the fuck they're called.  He got a hold of it.  Now he's slowly pulling it out.  Look at this.  Yeah!  Goddamn, you son of a fuck!  What is that?  It's as big as an oyster.  What is it?  Do you know what that would smell like  if you held it under your nose?  That looks like a baby mouse  that was just born.  That looks like a fucking... 
[03:07:00]  It looks like a small, wet rock.  That's fake.  No, it's not.  No, it's not fake.  Look, they show it afterwards.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  No, it's got fucking blood and mucus in it.  Yeah, man.  Ant is completely creeped out.  I can't...  Oh, where are you at with spit, Ant?  Good question.  Spit and pus, and then we can move on.  Oh, my God.  Pus is really fucking disgusting.  Pus isn't that bad, actually.  Pus is so disgusting.  I can't watch those...  Oh, God.  Zit-popping videos?  I can't...  I won't watch that.  Any of those big zit-popping videos. 
[03:07:30]  And boils.  People are popping and lancing online.  And spit...  Spit is the weirdest thing.  It's in your mouth.  Right.  You could even collect a bunch in your mouth and swallow it, and it doesn't bother you.  The second it leaves your mouth, it cannot return from whence it came, because that becomes  disgusting.  You would never, like, spit it out in a glass and then fucking drink it.  I'm not watching. 
[03:08:00]  But when it's in your mouth, it's fine.  But it's the same thing.  We got tablespoons today?  Let's see how many people on staff could spit into a tablespoon, and then, you're right,  put it back in your own mouth.  Why is that?  It's disgusting, but it shouldn't be.  Right?  So let's spit into spoons and then put them back in our mouths.  I'm not watching that.  No?  Come on, Steve.  You don't want to do that?  Nah.  Well, I won't do it.  It's not that bad, but, like, why do it?  Yeah, I guess.  You know?  But it's not like snot to me or anything. 
[03:08:30]  Saliva.  You know?  We should break, because we've got to talk about this Trayvon.  Trayvon!  Latest news on Trayvon Martin.  Yeah, I found his Twitter.  All right, we'll talk about it next.  I found his Twitter, and I was looking at a bunch of posts.  And I heard you were having fun with that yesterday.  Yeah, I was actually retweeting with comment on some of his tweets.  They were very gangsta-ish.  By the way, another guy that can relate.  And he said, I jerked off driving to Rochester just last weekend and missed my exit. 
[03:09:00]  He's a concentrating guy.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Right here.  On Sirius XM.  Now, what the fuck?  Like, Ian didn't pay her, is what she said?  Ian did not pay her?  He said he gave her the exact text that she sent to me. 
[03:09:30]  All right, hold on, zombie.  Hold on, hold on.  Because I don't want to lose this.  Stay in the line.  This is Olive.  Olive.  Olive.  Hi.  Hi.  You are one of the goddesses.  What the fuck?  You guys are waking me up.  What time is it?  It is very early, and we apologize.  But unfortunately, this is what time we have to do this stupid show.  Very important stuff.  We got the ECW zombie on the line.  Ian Halpern is threatening Anthony with a boxing match.  And of course, you were one of the fake goddesses on Friday. 
[03:10:00]  And we're trying to get to the bottom of this story.  Is she the goddess I just saw the picture of?  No fault of yours, though.  No fault of yours.  We realize, you know, what you were doing, and that's cool and everything.  We were hoping you were going to blow up his spot live on Friday, but that's all right, I guess.  We just want to know what the deal was with the...  The goddesses woke me up, too.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry, zombie.  We just want to know what the...  Hold on, hold on there, zombie man.  Zombie.  Hold on.  I'm going to put zombie on hold there.  Zombie doesn't sleep.  He's undead. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, he sure is.  He's friggin' something about radio.  Unknowledgeable.  I have no idea what I'm trying to say.  That's all right.  Hey, Olive.  You're thinking about the fight.  Olive's...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did Ian say that he was going to give you?  Did he say he was going to give you money?  Yeah, it was something like that. 
[03:11:00]  Something like that.  And what we're hearing from the zombie is that you weren't compensated for your appearance  here on the show, right?  I mean, I pretty much got some breakfast out of it, and that's about it.  Breakfast out of it.  Breakfast in a dress.  And, of course, the company for the day with the amazing Ian Halperin.  Oh, yeah.  Awesome.  It was awesome.  I had an awesome time.  Now, what is that like when you're hanging out with Ian?  Give us a little bit of, you know, obviously we saw what was going on here in the studio 
[03:11:30]  and having a lot of fun with it, but what was it like hanging out with him when you weren't  here on the show?  I mean, it wasn't that bad.  I mean, he's not that bad.  Yeah, but did you...  He has a ribbon of in your ass, but he's not that bad.  Did you answer a Craigslist ad?  My friend hooked me up with it.  My friend hooked me up with it.  What was the ad?  What did it say?  Yeah, what was the ad promising?  I don't know.  She hooked me up with it.  She was like, hey, come up here with me or whatever. 
[03:12:00]  Our opinion is Ian doesn't really like to have sex with girls, but we don't know for sure.  That's what I would think.  So...  No, he tried to put the moves on me.  He's not gay, guys.  He was trying to put moves on you, but he wasn't paying you enough for that shit, right?  I'm not a hoe, guys.  I'm not a hoe.  Are you not?  Okay, we have to ask this.  You're not an escort?  Yeah, because a lot of people are thinking you might be a hoe, so it's good you're saying  that to clear your own name here. 
[03:12:30]  No, I'm not a hoe.  Are you an actress?  I'm not an escort.  Yes, I'm an actress.  Okay.  Now, what was the attraction of the gig for you?  Did you think there'd be money, or what exactly did your friend tell you that it was going  to be?  It's going to be fun.  Get a little bit of cash out of it, whatever.  And I was like, oh, you know, I heard that you guys were raunchy assholes, and I kind of  got a slick mouth, so I was like, yeah, let me go on the air at 8 a.m., show these motherfuckers  what it's about, whatever.  Yeah.  And then, like, all I got out of you guys was black jokes. 
[03:13:00]  That's all we got, really.  Like, I wasn't, like, yeah, I'm like, okay, so let me go on air at 8 a.m.  Tootsies and Hootos, guys.  Who did that?  I was gone.  I'm so happy I was.  Oh, of course.  Anthony, you motherfucker, you.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know, I'm trying to keep it classy.  You know, I got my all-white, angelic outfit on.  You guys are lucky.  I know.  I was trying to be nice and ladylike.  I'm the resident racist around here, so, you know. 
[03:13:30]  You wanted to go ghetto.  You wanted to go ghetto on your ass.  Yeah, you guys are the first people to actually recognize that I'm black.  Everybody else thinks I'm Spanish, so.  Yeah, well, I think the other goddess kind of, you know, was kind of a, oh, okay, two black  chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you had a, did you know that, did you know the other girl?  Yeah, yeah, she's my friend.  Oh, okay.  So, you guys had to make believe you were high class, kind of going for your master's and 
[03:14:00]  all that bullshit.  No, we are high class.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, I do have degrees.  I do have degrees.  Oh, okay.  So, you guys were like, I was about to say it, but then she's like, oh, no, yeah, whatever,  but I really am educated.  Now, madam, you and I, I did not meet, so I didn't get a chance to talk to you.  What, what is your degrees in?  And how old are you?  Uh, I can't tell you my age, because models never tell their age.  Okay, fair enough.  But, um, media studies and psychology was minor in Spanish.  Oh, cool.  Are you a good actress?  I'm an awesome actress. 
[03:14:30]  I mean, you were fooled, right?  I was in here.  No, we weren't fooled at all.  We knew something was going on.  But that was more on the part of Ian.  We were really frustrated you didn't blow up his spot on Friday.  Were you getting, like, kind of skeeved out when he was kissing you so much?  Uh, no, no, not really.  I mean, it comes with the territory.  Uh, that's some territory.  Did you kiss him back?  Close mouth.  Oh, did I?  Yeah, no tongue.  I never saw your tongue.  I don't remember.  It was so fucking early, man. 
[03:15:00]  It was early.  When did you tell...  I don't remember.  When did you tell Ian to beat it?  Yeah, buzz off.  Yeah, how did this whole thing end?  I mean, after breakfast, it was like, okay, see you later, have a good one, whatever.  I mean, it wasn't like, it wasn't like, oh, get the fuck out of here.  Was he talking about, like, oh, that went really well, that was great, that was good? 
[03:15:30]  I love your impression of it.  Oh, priceless.  Ah, shit.  Fuckin' Ian, man.  Good times.  What did you have for breakfast?  I had, what, then or now?  Then.  Then or now?  No, no, then.  With Ian, where'd you go?  Oh, shit.  Some fuckin' early guy.  That's all right.  Blue Finn, it was nice.  It was nice.  He wasn't cheap.  He's not cheap, okay, so...  Oh, wow.  But he didn't give you any money.  I did get some nice stuff. 
[03:16:00]  Wait a minute.  I did get some nice stuff.  Olive, do you think he gave you a friend money and she might have shortchanged you?  Oh.  No, no, no.  It happens.  I think it.  No.  All right.  Yeah, he got her a dress and some karaoke and some burgers and breakfast.  Olive's very pretty.  Sounds right.  I like your photo.  Oh, thank you.  You're very lovely.  Yeah, Jimmy likes Olive.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Jimmy is attractive to Olive.  There's a picture of you with two creatures. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, the dumb fuckin'...  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I met Timmy doing a shoot on Sunday.  And I was like, man, I met a guy named Club Soda Kenny.  Isn't that an awesome name?  And he's like, Club Soda Kenny.  Opie and Anthony, right?  And then we realized that we know all the same fuckin' people.  I met the Elmo monsters, not the...  Oh, not the zombie monster.  Oh, my God.  You have a picture here with Elmo.  Fucking YouTube.  Giant Elmo.  YouTube, yeah. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Who filmed the Elmo video?  Some clown.  And I looked you guys up on Twitter.  Some fat fuck saying, oh, my God, those cunts are hideous.  And I'm like, you know what?  You think that these cunts are hideous because you've never seen a cut, you fat gay motherfucker,  you.  Right.  Sounds like the person I was talking to yesterday.  Whoever the fat motherfucker is on Twitter saying, those cunts are hideous.  Every fan we have.  Oh, my God.  Please.  You're talking to about 10,000 people at one time.  I know you're listening.  With that comment. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I know he's listening.  I know he's listening right now with his finger up his ass saying, who, me?  Who?  Yeah, this chick's ghetto, man.  Do you have a Twitter, Olive?  No, I don't Twitter.  No.  No.  Oh, wow.  Why not?  Don't Twitter.  Can we give your phone number to Jimmy?  No, don't give my phone number out.  My phone number is for special people only.  Oh.  Oh.  That's awesome.  People.  Give it to Jimmy Neurton.  Well, you were all right on Friday. 
[03:18:00]  We were just bummed you didn't blow up his spot because that would have been great for  us.  But it was funny.  Because he's such a phony with everything.  It was goddamn funny.  And over the top.  He gives us great radio.  And it was a Charlie Sheen thing.  It was a Charlie Sheen thing.  And he interviewed all Charlie Sheen's goddesses.  So it makes sense for him to come on the show with goddesses.  Of course.  Right.  Did you guys...  I thought you guys were catching on.  Did you guys sleep together?  Any of that shit?  In the same bed?  Any sex?  Anything going on? 
[03:18:30]  I might have to punch you out.  Oh.  That's a definite no.  That's a no, right?  Olive is saying she did not give up the booty to Ian Hubbard.  No.  And that's essentially what we need.  All we needed to know.  Remember, I like to keep it professional.  Did you not just call me this morning and I was like, hey guys, I want to keep it professional.  Yeah.  And you're like, oh, it'll be fun.  And I'm like, yeah, let me have some fun at the dressing hour.  Oh, believe me.  Compared to the last time you were on, this is the utmost professional.  Wait.  Yeah, that's why we're asking these questions.  Because, I mean, Ian wanted everyone to think that he was just having sex with you two all 
[03:19:00]  night long and, you know, staggered into the studio after, you know, pulling it all  night or so.  It's good to get your side of the story.  I did party all night, though.  That's why I didn't have any makeup on.  Yeah.  Ah.  And you are beautiful, by the way.  So, whoever is saying that on Twitter is ridiculous.  I don't, I only saw one picture of you, but I have to say you're very lovely.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  I would like to link arms with you. 
[03:19:30]  You'd like to link arms with me and frolic and skip down the sidewalk as we eat ice cream  and lollipops?  I was thinking more of chicken to a motel and do golden showers in the tub, but I mean,  that sounds fun.  Well, we can start there.  Yeah.  The way you said it sounds nicer.  Oh, what the hell?  We have a few hours to do.  Frolicking with lollipops?  Sure.  Before that.  So, have you been in plays and stuff?  Olive?  Olive? 
[03:20:00]  Hello?  Olive?  Yeah, can you hear me?  Yeah, now we can.  I have an iPhone.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you, have you?  I don't do, I don't do plays and theater.  I do mostly, like, modeling, print work and stuff.  Like, I've been in a couple of lookbooks and I do a lot of promotions.  Like, I've done everything from Nestle's and Espresso to, like, what else have I done?  And Self Magazine and Pop Chips and all kinds of stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  So, she's working.  Yeah, that's pretty much, yeah, that's pretty much how I make my money. 
[03:20:30]  I mean, I don't, if you want to call it a real job, I don't have a real job.  I don't nine to five it.  I mean, I make enough money doing this.  I don't have to work that hard.  Yeah, she's working.  Yeah, but Ian didn't pay her.  Yeah, wow.  That sounds like Ian.  He didn't give you actual cash at the end of it for your time?  No, but I mean, I'm cool with, like, the clothes thing.  I've worked, I've done trades before.  Like, I worked for, like, a buttload of makeup.  I worked at a trunk show and they gave me a couple pieces.  So, I consider that compensation, but cash would have been nice. 
[03:21:00]  How much did you want?  Uh, I can't disclose that because my prices vary depending on the client.  Yeah, but, um, uh, you can, you can disclose how much for a general thing like that.  I don't think that's a, because that was a, that's not.  You make a sound, you make a sound, you can disclose for a general client who just wants  a rub, rug and, rub and tuck.  No, no, no, I don't mean sex.  I don't mean, I don't mean sex stuff.  I mean, I'm trying to say it in a way, like, that's kind of a potential gig for you. 
[03:21:30]  You, you're hanging with a guy, but it's not like a modeling gig, which you pay a lot  more.  Yeah, all day to hang out and make, like, you're some guy's, uh, girlfriend for a radio show.  Like, that's probably a lower-end paying gig as a parent.  So, like, if you were modeling for something, you would obviously get paid more.  That's a, a more legit gig.  So, I'm just, I'm just trying to word it like that.  My day rate, my day rate's like 800.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  So, you would have, if you want me, if you want me for eight to ten hours, then you're 
[03:22:00]  going to have to pay me 800.  So, what he did, if he would have just handed you, like, unless we're, unless we're cool.  Right, right, right.  Or unless it's going to lead to other work or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  How tall are you?  I mean, I'm just, uh, 5'8".  Is that the right size for a model?  Just short.  No, you're supposed to be 5'9".  You're supposed to be 5'9 with 34 and shit, but I have way too much junk in the trunk,  so, I'm not, like, considered, I'm not considered agency model.  Okay.  Agency standard, but I get mad words. 
[03:22:30]  I look more realistic, so I get more of, like, the promotional side.  I target, I market myself more as, like, that target, gaffled, navy type of look.  Like, if you've seen my book, like, most of my stuff is, like, smiling, sweaters, and  jeans, like, jump shots, stuff like that.  I don't really do a lot of lingerie, and I don't do any nudes and stuff like that.  Do you have a big hiney?  Because you said junk in the trunk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she got an ass on her.  Have you seen it?  I know, I think I wasn't here.  Yeah, Jimmy wasn't here.  I was away.  You missed the best ever. 
[03:23:00]  I actually, I'm a dancer, and I was on the road.  I was in a dance troupe, and we traveled.  Oh, were you at Concomania?  You work at Chippendales?  I want to come see you.  No, no, not that kind of dancer.  I do, like, what's that?  Yeah, I do modern art, and, like, kind of interpretive dance.  I don't get interpretive dance.  Like, it's just, I'm like, what's going on here?  I don't know.  Even when I'm smoking a joint, I don't get it.  That's stupid.  Yeah, it's like, you know, just, you think of a dance like you interpret it. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  There's a picture of your hiney now talking to one of the blue creatures, and you have  money.  There's a picture of you.  Yeah, I gave him, yeah, you know what?  I was like, look at these Mexicans out here in Times Square hustling.  So, you know, I'll give them a dollar.  These Mexicans.  These little Mexicans in their dumb little hot suits.  Yeah, unbeknownst to me, I'm getting videotaped from behind, and that's the same asshole who's  like, those cunts are hideous.  Yes, I did my research.  Oh, damn.  Wait, the same guy who said you guys were hideous is the same one that posted? 
[03:24:00]  The same guy.  He was like, he was like, I've seen him on OPNS, me, and with those ugly cunts, and I  got video of him falling for the Elmo scheme, whatever, some stupid shit like that.  And I was just like, what an ass.  Yeah, I don't think that you're ugly.  I just, I need more photos of you.  I only saw the one, and you look rather cute.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I hear you're a lovely girl.  There's nothing wrong with her.  There she is.  And your personality.  Walking away with Ian.  Oh, yeah, she's...  You said there's nothing wrong with me.  I've got personality over here.  The only thing that was wrong was I'm walking away with Ian. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, walking away with Ian.  Ian, that's the hard part to swallow.  Yeah, she's pretty.  Like, oh, I can see...  Can you go back a little, Danny?  I think there's a little profile view, a side view.  When you walk away, you can see where the hiney is.  Yeah.  Juicy.  Yeah, very lovely.  You got a lot of juice.  And, oh, yeah.  And I'm a white guy, so I typically, I date white girls.  And I, I mean, I'm a typical white dude, but I like...  You like a little juice.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  It's okay.  It's okay if you're down with Brown.  I mean, I get it.  Oh, no, I'm not ashamed of it.  I just...  I just...  I'm just saying...  Are you the in-house racist?  What's that?  Are you the in-house racist?  Oh, and it's not down with Brown.  No, that's Anthony.  No, he's not down with Brown.  He won't even use UPS.  Most of those guys look like they're wearing long pants.  What's that about?  They only hire, like, Brown at this point, I think.  UPS?  UPS, yeah.  Yeah, oh, I'm so fucked up.  Do you date white guys? 
[03:25:30]  You know what?  It doesn't really matter to me, but I prefer Middle Eastern.  I don't know why.  I got this thing for A-Rabs.  Do you really?  Really?  Wow, that's weird.  You like when playing...  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  What do you like about the A-Rabs?  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know.  The dark eyebrows.  They always sound sexy.  I don't know what it is.  Do you like when you get on a line, how everybody just clears away, and you can immediately  go to the front of it with them? 
[03:26:00]  So you like the dark Middle Eastern, like, Mediterranean-type guys?  Lebanese.  Lebanese.  The guy that I was talking to you about.  Yes.  Do you like hairy guys?  Yeah, they got a lot of hair.  No, he's not hairy.  He's not that hairy.  Like, the ones that I've been with aren't that hairy.  Do you prefer them uncircumcised?  Ew, no way.  Cut that shit.  Cut that shit.  I'm not touching it if it's hiding from me.  If I have to go play hide-and-seek with it... 
[03:26:30]  Cut that shit.  See, I was...  I was circum...  I know, she's acting like it's a tag on a sweater.  I was circumcised, but I kind of wish I had my foreskin back.  I resented.  Why?  What?  Because you're born a certain...  I was circumcised, and I kind of wish I had my foreskin.  Are you kidding?  No.  Why would you want that?  Because I've beaten my penis up masturbating so much.  I feel like it's a boxer without that fucking protective helmet.  Like, if I had the foreskin, maybe I would have been a little gentler with it, and I'd 
[03:27:00]  have some more sensation.  Sensitivity?  Yeah.  Oh, God, no way.  And then you would not find a chick, like, worth it to roll that shit down and put her  mouth on it.  No way.  Well, if you keep it clean...  I mean, I'm not saying I would be unclipped and dirty.  There's no such thing as keeping that thing clean.  I don't care who you are.  There's no such thing as keeping that thing clean.  Lint gets in there, inevitably.  Lint.  It's like primetime real estate for Lint and, like, whatever stuff goes on there.  Gack.  Oh, you don't like that? 
[03:27:30]  Gack.  Gack.  Normally, what would be absorbed by the front of the undies after you take a leak or something  maybe is now just pooling up in there and rotting?  Does that shit smell, Olive?  What does it smell like?  Oh, God.  I only got close to it once.  I was just like, oh, my God.  What is this?  I'm not touching it.  I don't know.  I can't explain that to me.  It smells like something old.  It smells like something old.  I think I know it.  I'm like, what is this?  Like, butter gone wrong or something? 
[03:28:00]  I'm like, oh.  It smells like a belly button.  A belly button.  Yeah, yeah.  God, Olive.  Damn.  I think we got a new friend of the show.  With a little bit of a piss smell.  I'm like, what is this?  A little bit of a piss smell to it, too.  It happens that you try to shake it.  That last little drop hides under the fleshy hood.  Jimmy might be jerking off to you later.  Clip that shit off.  Would you come in and see us again?  Maybe.  Yeah, you should.  Maybe if you guys are nice to me this time. 
[03:28:30]  We're not paying.  Yeah.  You were just collateral damage for the bombs that were flying over to Ian.  Yeah.  Yeah, because when he comes in, we just get confrontational.  It's all about just going at him.  I knew it.  I mean, I know there's nothing personal.  You guys just have to be assholes on the air because that's the only way you can make a check at the end of the month.  Well, there you go.  She just described our show.  That's our job.  How sad is that?  That's what our boss has said to us.  That's actually in the contract.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Be assholes. 
[03:29:00]  Make complete assholes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just others around you.  Yeah.  Yes, it's really weird to look at a contract and see here within and assholes in the same sentence.  That's legal jargon.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should come in because I didn't get a chance to meet you and you seem very, very cool.  I'm very, very cool.  Yeah.  I'm cool as I...  I'm 42.  That's my idea of a compliment to a girl.  You seem very cool.  Like I'm 11.  If I give you a gum, will you come in?  I suck.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Just keep in touch, guys.  All right.  All right, Olive.  Thank you for calling and sorry we woke you up and all that.  Yeah.  Go back to sleep.  All right.  Bye, Olive.  For sure.  Later.  Bye-bye.  And the whole time the zombie's been listening in.  Hey, he's been listening in.  ECW zombie.  Say brains.  He's gone.  Oh, he's gone.  Aw.  He's like...  She was very nice.  All right, Kim, what's the deal?  I believe her.  I think she's an actress or a model or whatever.  Do you think if it's the right situation, she...  I don't know.  Nah, I don't think she does. 
[03:30:00]  For money, sex, nah.  Not yet, anyway.  If things don't pan out for her in a short time, I think she might have to dip over into  that side.  Yeah.  Nah, I think that she would...  You'd know it.  Like, she seemed like she was legit.  Like, she's not a hooker.  She's just a girl who...  A lot of girls model and act and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  And they won't ever fuck you for money.  I can see that.  I think she'd have to like you to fuck you, and she wouldn't expect money for that.  Yeah.  I don't get that vibe of her at all.  A lot of people are legit.  Yeah.  At 20, and then, you know, 25 hits, and... 
[03:30:30]  And now what?  And then maybe, you know, start pushing 30.  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I saw Anthony jotting a poem down, by the way, while she was talking for his girl.  He goes, if you ever fall, I'll always be there to catch you.  If you ever fall.  While they went ice skating.  What an asshole.  Remember that one?  Yeah, we do.  His poem stunk.  It doesn't rhyme.  So, we'll get into the boxing thing after the break-in. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, do we know what I said?  That upset Ian.  We have that?  We isolated.  I went through what happened after Ian Halperin left, and I got the most damaging of damaging  audio that was said.  Okay, because I'm trying to think, and I can't think of anything that I said that was any worse  than anything everybody else was saying.  Well, plus, you wouldn't say anything to his face.  It was only after he left.  While he was in the room, you wouldn't insult him at all.  We beat the shit out of him when he was in here.  I know. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't say anything bad to him when he was in here.  After I left the studio, you were saying things behind my back.  How about a boxing match?  You want to box?  How about a boxing match?  Yeah, really?  Right outside this building, the boxing match is going to happen.  One round.  One round.  You've got to get permits for the boxing match?  One round.  That's all I'll need.  TKO.  He's a TKO you.  One round.  You're out.  Wonder which type I should use.  Is that her?  No, go back to one.  Oh, that's the other one.  That's her? 
[03:32:00]  She accepted my friend request.  Oh.  She's got nice pictures on Facebook.  She's very pretty.  Yeah, absolutely.  Wow.  Let me see.  She definitely didn't look that good in the studio.  She was an all-nighter.  She was upset about the way they shot.  Wow.  Holy shit.  She was upset with what they'd done with her hair at the parlor.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's pretty.  Cool.  I normally just date white girls, but I think Olive and I are going to have to make a go  at it.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  She'll date me.  Please.  Give it a little shot, man. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So, Ian tweeted yesterday.  He wants to box Anthony because of the stuff that was said after the show, which is crazy  because the stuff on the show is pretty wild.  And the other thing, to the listeners that don't get it, I don't know what to tell you.  They're like, why would you have Ian on if you guys hate him so much?  Shut the fuck up, people.  Yeah, if you don't get it.  That's the whole reason we have him in is for that confrontation.  Because you're living vicariously through him.  Right.  Through his highness.  It's like, that's her. 
[03:33:00]  That's her usually without the makeup.  Well, look, here's the thing.  When you have a Facebook page, you're going to put the best pictures of it.  You're not going to put what you really look like.  You're going to put the angles that make you look better than you are.  So, you know, you can't just look at a profile picture and be like, oh, she's all.  Even that picture, she's all right.  The hair's a little too curly in that one, but.  Are you saying nappy?  She's a Ray Dawn Chong thing.  A little nappy.  She's trying to put the boop lips there.  She's got like eye makeup there.  She's got really nice eyes and really big lips.  You hear this? 
[03:33:30]  That's what happens.  Right there.  And you slap like your three-quarter hard dick on a lipstick.  All right.  We'll play the clip that got Ian all riled up.  Oh, great.  And had him tweeting that he wants to box Anthony outside this studio.  I can't wait for the boxing match.  I popped up Twitter last time.  I'm like, what the fuck is it?  What about you to battle?  Yes, you are.  But this guy, give me a break.  You know what's funny?  Maybe get Ian on the line, matter of fact, after the break.  Yes.  We were talking about Forshkin. 
[03:34:00]  And I was going, it's like something died under there.  And I looked at the clock.  It was seven in the morning.  People just waking up.  Yeah.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Well, we got Ian Halpern on the line here. 
[03:34:30]  Your Highness, how did your TV Guide movie go?  It went very well.  I want to thank everybody at Opie and Anthony for having me on.  I'm glad Norton's in there.  Norton.  I idolized Jim Norton.  Hello.  You guys added me today.  Look, I've been working on a book about Craigslist the last three years, undercover.  It's called How the Wild Wild Web...  dot, dot, dot, Craigslist.  And you guys got me, and kudos to you guys.  You know, I got egg on my face this morning, and listen, I love Anthony, man. 
[03:35:00]  You guys have lasted so long in this business.  There's so many pretenders in this business, and that's all I have to say.  Look at His Highness, His Majesty.  Let me just finish.  Let me finish.  Yes, yes.  I love ONA.  I've loved being on your show all this time, and thank you for the opportunity, guys.  That's all I can say.  Great work today.  So, Ian, what you're saying is you did this Craigslist thing yesterday, or the other day,  Friday, as part of an undercover operation for a new book that you're putting out. 
[03:35:30]  That's right.  What I'm saying is you guys will be in the book.  I've been working on a book about Craigslist for almost three years now, and it's all about  going undercover on Craigslist and all the stories about how the Wild Wild Web plays out.  Are you married?  No, I'm not.  I have a daughter.  I'm a father, and I take parenting extremely seriously.  How are you taking it seriously when you're just traveling all the time?  Well, you know, I make time for my daughter. 
[03:36:00]  I can't even leave my house.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, but you have a baby, Opie.  When I had my daughter, you know, the first seven years, I was with my daughter 24-7, and  then I resumed my career.  And you figure at seven years old, she's learned everything she needs from her dad.  That's it.  That's all she could take.  She kicked her father out at seven years old.  Yeah, he said, how are you?  She said, don't you have a book to write?  Hey, whatever happened with that girl I met in Montreal with you who was fucking...  Well, she was legit.  She was smoking, man. 
[03:36:30]  I dated her for several months, and because she lives in Norway, you know, a long-distance  relationship is very...  You know, every time I get on a fucking plane, it's like 13 hours to, you know, get shagged.  She was very pretty.  Yeah, she was.  Wow, is she nice.  Yeah.  But, Norton, you know, I love you guys, man.  And I...  Bravo.  Of course he does.  When I came back, I said, all these guys, and Travis, your producer, told me it didn't  play down that way.  All you guys had to do was check the security rule at Sirius that day, Facebooker, and you 
[03:37:00]  owed his highness.  I said it would be so easy to do that, but apparently played down another way.  But, hey, to everyone at ONA, I got egg on my face today.  I acknowledge it.  They got me.  They went undercover to...  Undercover.  We learned from the best, your highness.  What happened with this boxing thing?  Walk us through that.  Me and Anthony, you know, I'd set up a makeshift ring outside the Sirius building. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  Austin La Jolla would referee.  Right, right.  And me and Anthony would spar.  Now, he wants to use a gun.  No, no, I never said that.  I'll let him draw first.  He didn't say he was going to use a gun.  I never said I was going to use a gun.  He might have threw the bullets.  Anthony does throw bullets.  Yes, I throw them very hard.  Much the way like a monkey throws his own semen.  Anthony throws bullets.  Don't be confused.  It'll leave a little damage.  No, I would never do that unless I felt my life was being threatened.  And by the likes of a little Jewish man from Canada, I wouldn't feel that way. 
[03:38:00]  I'm not that small, Anthony.  I know.  You're a big gentleman.  It's fine.  Yeah.  No, but, you know, I thought me and Anthony going a couple of rounds in front of all the  serious listeners would be a lot of fun.  I don't think so.  I don't like getting punched.  I don't like being punched in the head.  It's a feeling that it doesn't feel good.  Yeah, I hear you.  You know what?  Maybe it was a bad idea.  Yeah.  A little bit. 
[03:38:30]  So you're backing down off the boxing match.  Well, if he did, you know, I'd step in the ring today with Anthony.  And then we'd go out for a few beers after, and, you know, maybe I'd get Jill Nicolini  to referee the man.  Why are you obsessed with Jill Nicolini?  That's years ago.  You know what?  That might be, what, three years ago now?  She's got a 4.0 GPA, and she only talks good things about Anthony.  When was the last time you talked to her?  I talked to Jill about a year ago.  I was on their TV show at, what is that, Channel 11 she's on or something, CW11. 
[03:39:00]  CW, is it?  Yes.  Yeah, you're right.  Picks 11 now.  In fact, I know her mother very well.  You know how I met Jill?  I met her on the Sally Jessie Raphael show.  We were both guests.  And, you know, to me, there's very few people left in the media I respect.  And I'll say this on your show with all due respect to you guys, because I respect you  guys to the utmost.  I respect Howard.  I respect Judith Regan.  Not Judith.  You know, people who are on the playing field.  But I miss people like Sally Jessie Raphael, who I thought was a fantastic host, fantastic 
[03:39:30]  personality.  You know, there's not many of us left today in the media who give that fiery controversy  that...  Like who it says us.  ...who are personalities.  And I've always said, you guys should have your own TV show.  You're, you're, uh, you're, you're, you're mellow, Ian, today.  Well, he's, uh, he's, he's keeping it real.  He's egg on the face, Ian.  He's keeping it real.  He's humble.  He's a little humble today.  You've been humble?  You guys humbled me, man.  You outed me. 
[03:40:00]  You're the first people.  Oh, well.  Well, Ian, you said I'd be making this phone call.  Ian.  I told you, if someone could do it better than his highness, I'll be the first guy tipping  my cap to them.  So I called in.  It's bravo.  Ian.  You know what you got to do now, right?  You told me.  You got to take a dick from Shaq.  Well, you know.  I'm sorry, brother, but you said it a lot on Friday about Shaq humbling people with,  throwing Shaq's dick around a lot.  I think you might have to take Shaq's dick now.  I don't take dick. 
[03:40:30]  That's one thing.  Well, if you've been humbled, it's not gay.  That's true.  There's no dick coming to his highness's place.  It's not gay to take dick if it's a wager.  That's right.  If you lose a wager.  If you're settling a wager, it's okay.  That's right.  Anthony.  Yes.  I'll call him Sir Anthony today.  Thank you, sir.  Damn.  That's good.  If he steps in the ring with his highness in front of Sirius Radio, I'll pay for the whole event.  It's just a jerk.  The loser gets a date with Shaq.  How's that? 
[03:41:00]  Now, you know what?  Like I said, I'm really not into any type of getting hit in the face or body with any kind of punches.  I respect that.  How's it about you, Ralph Marie, and Opie will step in the ring with his highness?  All right.  Were you hoping that we would really react to the Sally Jesse Raphael thing?  Because we really didn't give you much on that one.  I know.  She's a kook.  You know, I knew Sally Jesse, and she was a player, man.  She had a radio show.  She had a TV show. 
[03:41:30]  She lasted like 25, 30 years.  How many years was she on TV?  Anyone.  I have no fucking respect for anyone in this business who comes out for a cup of coffee.  I've been in this business over 20 years.  You guys have been in this business for eons.  I think you were older than Moses.  I think you were reading the news off the tablets back in the day, you guys.  But you're around.  You're players.  Boo!  Any motherfucker who just comes along, like Nick Cannon. 
[03:42:00]  How long has Nick Cannon been around?  He's been blasting for all.  You know, Nick Cannon right now is listening to this show.  In person.  Yes.  And he's getting a heart.  There's something about that relationship.  And by the way, read the news.  I said the Governator was the biggest womanizer in Hollywood ever.  Yeah.  And, hey, a lot of people criticized me.  Ian, hold on a minute.  And I know you don't like listening.  Now, you've got egg on your face.  I really want to ask you a real question here. 
[03:42:30]  In your book, The Governator, which you went undercover for,  did you know that he had a love child with the help?  Yes.  Yes.  Is it in the book?  There was documentation of that.  We couldn't provide corroboration, and the publisher said,  don't go with it.  The lawyer's better than it.  Oh, no.  But you like a good lawsuit, Ian.  Well, you know, we don't need a good lawsuit with the Governator.  But one thing is, you know, ironically, his people called me, and I'll tell you a good story. 
[03:43:00]  It was the California Chamber of Commerce.  I rarely do public speaking.  I used to do it.  I used to tour around when my Cobain stuff was popular, and I rarely go out and speak in public anymore.  So, anyhow, his former political advisor, who was in Sacramento with him, her name's Pat, she called.  She wanted me to do the keynote at the California Chamber of Commerce.  Pat who?  I think I know her.  Pat who? 
[03:43:30]  Her last name?  Mufani?  Google Pat.  Google it.  Google it.  Anyhow, so I went there, they brought me out, flew me first class to a place called Ontario, California.  And I'm telling you, I didn't prepare one note.  When they were introducing me, the senator of California was in the front row.  This was a few months ago.  All that's going on in my head, I say, what the fuck am I getting into here?  Language.  The lights go on, but when I stepped on the stage, it was showtime. 
[03:44:00]  I had them laughing for an hour.  So you got...  With a eulogy.  You got that power.  When you hit the stage, you know it's time to perform.  Well, yeah, you know, when the lights go on, you got a delivery.  Oh, I hear you.  What is he saying?  He lost me a while.  He's talking about Pat.  I know who Pat was.  Yeah, who's Pat?  Her name was...  Pat Taylor Cakes. 
[03:44:30]  She would always just use her middle initial.  I thought it was Pat E. O. Furniture.  Do you guys still love me?  Yeah, we love you.  How could we not?  But now that the Arnie thing is out there, what could you add to that story?  Oh, no, it was Pat E. Wathop.  I hope Anthony gives it to her right from behind, right in the mouth.  You know, the way Anthony gives it. 
[03:45:00]  I hope he gives it to her really hard.  What?  So you have nothing to add to the Arnold Schwarzenegger story.  You said you had documentation and all that.  Like, who was the help?  Ah.  The help who he was fucking, Arnold?  Yeah, that he had the baby with.  No, the one who forgot to return the fucking weed whacker to the neighbors.  I think he's going to a newspaper right now, hoping he can get some knowledge.  You said you have documentation.  The kid might be as old as 10 at this point.  Yeah.  10 years old.  And who was the help? 
[03:45:30]  I don't know.  You think I gave a shit about who was the help today?  It was the housekeeper.  All that I care about is book sales.  The book's going through the roof today.  You know, I'm not.  Hopefully due to an explosion in your house.  My whole fucking book is about Arnold's sex coupades.  That's all it's about.  Yeah.  Except for this one.  And everyone doubted his highness.  Well, again, you've been vindicated.  He came on the record and said he's fabricating all this.  Well, where is that mooch today? 
[03:46:00]  What's that guy?  Aaron, whatever his name was.  His name was Aaron.  And just because he's not getting off the hook today.  Hold on.  Aaron.  Aaron who?  He's fabricating the whole thing.  Aaron who?  Aaron who?  Aaron Burr.  I live in the now.  My message is like shot from all these goddesses and pseudo goddesses, whatever.  Aaron, Hank.  Who is it?  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it. 
[03:46:30]  Catchphrase.  Google it.  He came out in the New York Post.  Google Aaron and Ian.  He said it on page six in the New York Post.  You could Google it right now that I was fabricating the whole thing and I was full of crap.  Where is this douchebag today?  Language.  This is my home.  All right, Ian.  How was your gig?  It was good.  Thank you.  DC was very enjoyable.  We can't just have a phone call today.  We've got to move on.  Yeah, we've got to have a phone call today.  I love you guys all the best. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, you've got egg on your face.  You're not boxing Anthony.  And you had the Arnold scoop.  Good bye.  But you couldn't put it in your big book because you would have got sued.  And then tweet.  That sounds good.  12 hours later.  But peace out, everyone.  O.P. and Anthony.  Peace out.  Good bye.  Jim Norton.  All right, Ian.  You guys got me today.  Good bye.  Thank you, Ian Halperin.  Hey, hey, hey.  No one join.  This is the worst O.P. and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:47:30]  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sassy black bitches don't ever get reprimanded, though.  Never.  You can't reprimand them.  You can't.  Sassy black bitches don't get in trouble, man.  Because they got a lot of power.  You can't find a lot of sassy black bitches.  Sassy black bitches.  So if you got one, you got to hold on to them and take care of them.  I ain't taking that shit from like the human.  They got rid of the cute sassy black bitch here.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  She was cute, too. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, she was good.  I like the girl at the front desk there.  I don't know what happened.  I think sassy.  I think maybe sassy black bitches are good.  Maybe she got a better gig.  Sassy's out.  I don't know.  I think she's got a better gig.  Sassy's out.  I don't think it is, because downstairs they got a couple.  They got a sassy Puerto Rican.  But y'all don't have to deal with the sassy security guard bitches.  I wouldn't even know how to talk to a sassy Puerto Rican.  How do you do that?  There's a sassy Puerto Rican.  Is there a way to talk to a sassy Puerto Rican?  Sassy Puerto Rican girls.  I could talk to a sassy black broad.  Easy. 
[03:48:30]  Really?  Sassy Puerto Rican.  I'd probably look like a fool.  I could talk.  I'd look like an idiot.  I feel like I could talk to the sassy black broad.  I could talk.  But that sassy Puerto Rican?  Oh, man.  They could bring Mars in.  That's a whole other world.  Is there even a...  I don't even know if there are sassy Puerto Ricans.  They're right.  There's one downstairs.  They got a sassy Puerto Rican.  What makes her sassy?  It's a lack of happiness that... 
[03:49:00]  He has an answer for me.  And it's always just true.  It's always right there.  It's not just let me pull an answer out of my eyes.  It's like, God, that makes sense.  And this company wants to pay you what for a show?  Get the fuck out of here.  It's a...  Patrice is the answer, man.  It's just a...  It's just a lack...  It's just like you're there and there's just no...  You feel like there's absolutely...  They know there's no consequence for being not attentive and not friendly. 
[03:49:30]  Right, right.  You know, there's a real technique to being friendly where you're not following me because  you think I'm stealing and you're not treating me poorly.  Right.  The best service I've ever had in my entire life, ever, was in a gay supermarket in L.A., on  Santa Barbara.  What makes it a gay supermarket?  It was the Pavilion.  It was absolutely gay.  Only sells zucchini, carrots, cucumbers.  Only hard, hard, torpedo-shaped foods. 
[03:50:00]  Fucking hot dogs, bratwurst.  The pudding is hard and fish-shaped pudding.  Everything they sell is in the shape of a fucking torpedo.  Everything is frozen.  Fucking...  All soft things are frozen.  The iced tea is...  Dildo-shaped iced tea containers.  Apples are carved into complete balls. 
[03:50:30]  Just around...  Is that where we're going in society?  You knew this was a gay supermarket?  Well, it was the Pavilion in Santa Barbara.  Was it in a gay area?  Yeah, it was absolutely gay, but it was only...  It was only...  But it was such a great supermarket...  Oh, I'm sure.  ...that all the 85-year-old men with muscles...  Yeah.  ...that were with each other didn't bother me.  The old queens didn't bother you?  Did not fucking bother you.  It was the most magnificent experience ever. 
[03:51:00]  I said, sir, where's the grape juice?  Yeah.  And the guy takes my hand, and we run over to the grape juice.  He just brings me over to the grape juice.  Starts pushing my cart.  It just was extraordinary.  It was almost like heaven.  Oh, that's great.  All the fucking checkout lines had somebody in there checking shit out.  Every one of them.  Not one person on break. 
[03:51:30]  The nigga supermarket, one...  One person.  ...8,000 people, and one person at the checkout line.  Excuse me.  And it's a black bitch.  I'm on my break.  And she mad.  I'm on my break.  You're going to be surprised if it comes from me instead of Anthony, but what is it with  black people behind the counters?  Like, at Starbucks...  It's just rude.  I'm a Starbucks guy, and there'll be three black people working the Starbucks.  Starbucks is different, though, see?  Yeah, yeah.  Starbucks don't let you be fucking black.  Starbucks gets nerdy black people. 
[03:52:00]  No, man.  They don't seem to let nobody fucking...  No, man.  ...unfriendly.  I've never seen unfriendly black people at Starbucks.  The line was getting completely ridiculous, because out of the three, only one was working,  and the one was sort of looking at paperwork, and I'm like, there's nothing on that paper  that's more important than this line right now.  And then another guy finally comes out of the back all annoyed that he now has to, like,  you know, help cut down this line that's getting ridiculously long.  What you want, coffee, nigga?  That's how I feel.  I felt in this situation, like I was bothering that bitch-ass nigga want coffee. 
[03:52:30]  Damn.  I felt like you want to be up for, motherfucker.  I felt like I was bothering them.  You up, nigga?  Next.  You want to be up?  What is that about?  It was one situation.  I don't see it all the time, you know, to be honest, but...  I don't...  I think it's a lack...  First, it's you got to be your boss.  I've run into...  Mm-hmm.  I've run into, like, where the...  It's the hood.  It's the hood.  Look, I got a car from the hood dealership. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  The attitude, I think...  Look, man, my mother is a hell of a...  She's a motherfucker.  Shopping.  I go shop with my mom when she's in town, and I go, I think she enjoys the war.  Oh, really?  It's a battle.  And it's not black guys.  It's just not...  We don't cause problems.  It's black women, and it's shocking.  My mother, and I'm going to speak because I love my mother, but she is brutal. 
[03:53:30]  I love an example.  Dude, she makes people at Marshall's individually newspaper-wrapped plastic cups.  Plastic cups.  Plastic cups.  What?  Like when you're buying plastic cups, like when you buy fine crystal, they wrap it up  in the paper so it doesn't clang together. 
[03:54:00]  And if this was a white woman, you would wrap them up.  Right.  And why won't you...  Why aren't there stronger plastic bags?  I want to see...  Oh, shit.  I want to know why you have these plastic bags.  And what do you do?  And this was open, and I want you...  Do you stroll away, or do you just...  I go, mums.  Mums.  If it fucking breaks, I don't care. 
[03:54:30]  Look in the back.  See if you have this same thing.  Yeah.  But just from the back.  Wow.  My mother's brutal.  But she's not brutal like super ghetto.  Yeah, yeah.  She's brutal like a whole black lady that ain't taking shit.  Right.  But there's no shit to be tooken.  So she just makes shit.  So she'll make shit.  She's war-like.  My mother's war...  She's war-like. 
[03:55:00]  Have you been in a situation with her where you get just mortified and embarrassed?  No, because my mom's in her 60s and her 50s.  She's just swelling up.  And I just...  I don't even argue with my moms no more.  It's like, just let her do it.  Matter of fact, I'm going to tell you something.  I respect and listen to my mother more now because I don't have to listen to her.  Right, right.  So now I kind of appreciate moms, but she's not even horrific because she talks to... 
[03:55:30]  Here's what my mother does.  She talks down to people.  Uh-huh.  Like, she doesn't...  She's not like, what?  What?  Like, if you watch that show Hardcore Pawn, if you ever see that show?  Oh, God, yeah.  Where it's like, I have my granddaddy's watch.  What can I get for it?  Well, what do you want?  A thousand?  I'll give you two dollars.  Oh, fuck you and your mama, nigga!  And she shits on the floor.  The woman shits on the floor.  I'll be back with my cousins! 
[03:56:00]  Shoot your Jew ass up!  Sad bitch-ass nigga!  What you gonna do?  What the fuck you gonna do?  Shit on the floor.  Wipe her ass.  Throw the shit tissue right on the window.  Holy shit!  Motherfucker!  This my mama's watch!  This shit worth more than motherfucking two dollars!  Holy shit!  My mother's more like...  That's exactly shit!  She just makes you feel really bad.  You know, she's been through the fucking civil rights.  So she just enjoys... 
[03:56:30]  Especially white people.  So if she can talk down to a white person and just make them work harder than they fucking need to...  My mom is just brutal with that shit.  Doesn't give a shit.  Doesn't give a shit about nothing.  Never gets embarrassed about...  I go...  And then she'll go...  God bless her.  She'll be aware enough to go...  You think I'm just being too hard?  I can't stop it. 
[03:57:00]  And you're like, nah...  You know, sometimes...  You're just getting what you...  You know, what's yours.  But she's just...  You go...  You go...  Yeah, she can have it now.  But she's never been...  Motherfucker!  But I...  But knowing my mother's always been a big black lady...  There's something about...  I think white people...  White women...  White men find them to be hilarious.  Hilarious?  Hilarious.  That's why they put them in movies. 
[03:57:30]  White women find them to be liberating.  Like where...  You know, I've seen how white women, when I was younger as a child, would gravitate towards my mother.  Because black women do shit like...  Oh, oh, oh, oh!  Talk to the hand and all that shit.  They'll be like, oh, yeah!  And white women go, that's right.  Go get them, Bertha.  That's right.  Bertha!  Because black women walk in a room, and they're having a meeting, like the bosses.  Excuse me! 
[03:58:00]  Excuse me, bosses!  Yeah.  But somebody got my stapler!  I know you...  I know the bosses are having a fucking party in here!  And then they'll be like, hey, Bertha...  Bertha, they trying to make...  They trying to make us work this Saturday.  What?!  Ain't nobody working on no motherfucking Saturday!  You tell them, Bertha!  Get us off on Saturday!  It says here in the bylaws... 
[03:58:30]  Oh, shit!  Section 12, code 62!  I ain't working on no motherfucking weekend!  Unless I get double-double time!  Double-double time!  I get double-double time and a half, nigga!  You can't fire that person.  No, they never get fired.  They never get fired.  Win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, gentlemen, another show.  Well done!  I knew what to expect.
