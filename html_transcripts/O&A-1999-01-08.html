<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast on a snowy Fight Friday, opened with a segment heavily focused on listener-submitted "F You Fridays," featuring numerous calls expressing frustration over the weather and traffic.  A particularly offensive and repetitive Jets parody song was relentlessly mocked by the hosts, who used homophobic slurs in their descriptions.  Angry Andrew, a caller with highly offensive and insulting F-you messages, became a recurring bit. The hosts satirized repetitive weather reporting from the news media. A bizarre and sexually charged interlude occurred with a caller claiming to be Popeye, celebrating his cartoon marriage to Olive Oyl with crude jokes and euphemisms.  Rod Stewart's divorce and the hosts' own past on-air blunders were also discussed.  Street reporters Black Earl (providing live traffic updates from snowy Manhattan) and Yoshi the Pork Man (detailing his struggles delivering food by bicycle in the snow, making a suggestive comment) contributed to the broadcast.  Throughout the show,  contests offering Black Crows concert tickets were promoted.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the stock market, specifically the volatility of Amazon stock, and Opieâ€™s near-miss with a profitable trade.  This segued into a discussion of unusual food combinations, including the hosts' and callers' experiences with sugar and butter sandwiches, "hocklages" (butter and sprinkles sandwiches), potato chips and mayonnaise sandwiches, and apple butter sandwiches.  A profane and angry caller was repeatedly connected and disconnected, leading to speculation about their identity and motivations.  The conversation shifted to the challenges of relationships, particularly Opie's experiences living with his girlfriend and her mother, humorously compared to a cat marking its territory.  The tone shifted abruptly when Carol Miller, a female guest, joined the show, expressing disapproval of the conversation and sharing her views on cohabitation.

The show concluded with weekend plans, further traffic updates from Yoshi the Pork Man (still struggling with snowy deliveries and making a suggestive comment), and a final, humorous traffic report that included an absurd request to drivers to clear a path for the hosts.  The broadcast ended with the hosts leaving for the weekend.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Elvis Costello, and Pump It Up, Counting Crows Before That,  and Stevie Ray Vaughan with Cold Shot.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  On this fight, fight Friday afternoon.  A little snowy out there.  A lovely day to be driving around.  Chowd, everyone.  Watch yourself on the drive home, people.  Please take a little extra time.  Make a little extra time, and please don't drive unless you have to.  And if you're walking around the streets of Manhattan, be careful.  You don't want to slip. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The sidewalks are slidewalks today.  Can you tell Anthony and I were stuck in a car for two hours,  and we're listening to all the news stations?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Let's talk with Laura, who we met on the street today,  who enjoys this kind of weather.  Yeah.  She enjoys it because she probably walks to work.  Yeah.  That's why she enjoys it and wants to see it snow a half a foot.  I enjoy the tractor trailer flipping over by the fairgrounds on the expressway, 
[00:01:00]  closing all lanes.  People on the LIE, we were with you today.  Oh, man.  Isn't that great when that happens?  But we've got to tell all the news stations and the TV news.  There you go.  New York 1.  Doing a weather update.  Of course.  We're not retards.  Snows every year, and I think by now we have kind of figured it out.  You know how to handle it.  Yeah.  Except driving in it.  What is...  People don't know how to drive.  Well, it's just people spinning. 
[00:01:30]  I see them on the side of the road.  Did you see on Northern State Parkway?  Had three, four cars.  Mm-hmm.  Poor Wang at the end of the line.  You had to bring that up.  Now, I don't think Wang caused the accident.  No, but he was the last one.  We argued that point for 20 minutes today.  He was the last one in.  Wang was the last one in on that pileup.  Car stride.  Stride in.  Could not stop.  Anthony is racist.  Hey, stop.  You're racist.  We come to the accident site.  We're in rubbernecking for, what, 20 minutes? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And you see Wang on the side of the road.  You go, safe figures.  They can't drive.  What are you talking about?  I never said that.  And then I go, wait, man.  Maybe Wang was the last one in on the accident.  How do you know he was last in?  I just have a feeling he was last in.  Because there were other cars ahead of him that were off to the side of the road.  Maybe that was one of his cars.  Unless he started driving backwards.  Just because it was the white van with all the Chinese writing on it?  You assume that it was his van? 
[00:02:30]  And a Jersey Turnpike.  Yeah, another van.  At last count, 22 accidents.  Oh, my Lord.  People don't know how to drive in this.  But news people, shut up.  Big F you to the news people.  Yeah.  We're not retards.  Weather geeks, news people.  I mean, they actually had a reporter at the sanitation department where they keep their salt.  By the big pile of salt.  And the guy was reporting that he's standing next to the pile of salt. 
[00:03:00]  The sanitation department, I'm here by the big salt pile.  Plenty of salt being spread on the roads.  Really?  I thought the city was going to blow off the salt this year and try using cotton balls.  It's the same thing every year.  Every year.  So, big F you to them.  There you go.  And it is F you Friday.  And I'm kind of disappointed in you guys.  We haven't done an F you Friday in three weeks.  And we've got a pile of them.  But none that are really that good. 
[00:03:30]  No?  No, not at all.  So, if you want to get your F you on the air, please fax us.  212-957-WNEW.  And everyone's calling about the Black Crows.  Here's the deal on that.  Later this hour, when you hear Won't Get Fooled Again by The Who,  we'll be at the 10th caller to win a pair of tickets to see the Black Crows Tuesday night.  1-0-2-7-WNEW, The Rock of New York.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On the way, the latest from Collective Soul.  Got some who, too.  And it is F you Friday.  They keep the faxes coming in. 
[00:04:00]  212-957-WNEW.  Bob writes, hey, guys, I would like to send a big F you to Mayor Giuliani,  who said that, as a New York City cop, I shouldn't get a raise for doing nothing.  We are some of the lowest paid in the state.  I guess the lowest murder rate in 30 years and double-digit drops in crime mean nothing.  Thanks.  Wow.  And he said he hated us at first until we mentioned the Comac Motor Inn,  which is an old stomping ground for him.  CMI.  CMI.  Everybody out on the island knows that place. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  All right.  The Jets parody song sucks.  A big F you to Opie for liking that ridiculous YMCA song parody.  It's fudge-packing, bandwagon-jumping morons like the guy who took credit for that pile of trash  who have no clue what it means to be a longtime Jets fan.  Go Jets, go.  Anthony, please trash all copies of that song.  We did get a third copy of the song today. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah, we did.  He keeps sending the damn thing in.  You know, and I can't play the bit anymore.  I hate this song, too.  I don't want anyone to think that I actually like this parody song.  Yeah, people are calling off going, Opie, you actually like that song?  No, it's called Sarcasm.  Look into it.  Right?  Yeah.  It's awful.  Well, I got it here.  Would you like to listen to it again?  Why would I want to hear that again?  Just because I know how much it annoys you.  It is.  It's so gay. 
[00:05:30]  It is so gay.  Yeah, but see, Anthony, Z100 is playing the song around the clock, so it must be good.  We're missing something, obviously.  Oh, God.  It's insane.  They actually play the same song and think it's great.  Yeah.  That's how pathetic they are over there.  Oh, well.  Well, let's try it one more time, Anthony.  Oh, you're thinking maybe we haven't heard it enough.  You know, sometimes you hear a new song on the radio and it takes a few listens and then  it kind of grabs you.  Right.  Maybe the third listen, Anthony, it'll grab you. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm willing to give it another shot.  You have an open mind.  Oh, sure.  Let's say.  Let's let it rip.  Because certainly if Z100 likes this song, you and I must like this song as well.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Starts out good, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  It's great.  Oh.  Get the strap on and lube it up good. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, come on.  How many of these CDs are laying around here?  This is the third copy we got.  Here comes the hook, Anthony.  Here it comes.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it's not growing on me. 
[00:07:00]  Are you sure?  Positive.  You're sure?  This guy's wasting CDs and FedExes.  In our mailbox today was another copy of this song.  The guy knows we've already trashed two copies of his song, but he sends it every single day. 
[00:07:30]  I guess he needs us on the big bandwagon here for his jet song, Anthony.  No, let Z100 play it.  Oh, God.  What kind of lyrics are these?  What?  What?  Who's too small?  What?  Come on.  It's good.  It's homo. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  No?  Enough of the jet song.  Oh, wait.  This is the hook again.  Give me it.  Give me it.  Give me it.  Give me it.  What are you doing?  Give me it.  Get it out of the machine.  Get it out.  Get it out of there.  Get it.  I'm not even faking it this time.  I'm not even making like I'm going to put it somewhere nice like I did the other two days.  And then smash it.  It's just getting it.  That's it.  Oh, Anthony. 
[00:08:30]  Come on.  We need to play that song next week.  Oh.  What are you doing?  What are you doing to me here?  INEW.  Yeah.  I'm a jet fan.  Yeah.  I'm a jet fan.  I bleed green and white.  Let me tell you something about that song.  Yeah.  That song makes you want to root for the Jaguars.  Do you understand how bad that is?  I'm thinking about, I love basketball now.  That song is so bad.  You've got to turn that off and put, oh man, the Super Bowl Shuffle. 
[00:09:00]  The Super Bowl Shuffle.  All right.  Cool.  We've got to go.  All right.  Thank you.  Not quite the classic that Let's Go Mets Go was.  Well, okay.  If the guy who wrote that song is listening, we need a fourth copy of that.  No, we don't.  Yeah, it's because I'd like to see you turn red and get pissed off.  Hi, NEW.  Hey, I've got to send a big FU out to you two guys.  Why?  I'm a giant fan.  Yeah?  But I was going to be rooting for the Jets for the playoffs.  Yeah.  But I just heard that song. 
[00:09:30]  I can't root for the Jets now.  I've got no team to root for.  Can you believe Z100 is playing that and they're all psyched and like it's a good song?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  What do they put the strap on in between songs over there?  Do you think Keyshawn's going to sue over that lyric?  I hope so.  If I was him, I would.  All right.  Talk to you guys later.  Thank you.  Bye.  I love his little story when he sent us the first one.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, well, me and my friend were driving back from the game and we were listening 
[00:10:00]  to the radio and YMCA came on and we just started singing J-E-T-S to YMCA.  And I'm just thinking, what self-respecting guy is driving home from a football game with  his buddy listening to YMCA?  YMCA.  I've never been in a car with a friend of mine and YMCA has ever come on.  You think they were, you know, making the Y and the M and the C?  Yeah, I think so.  Which one was driving?  The police or the construction worker guy?  Hi, N-E-W. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, there's a reason that I don't have Z100 on my presets.  Why?  Because they play that damn song.  There's a reason why I have N-E-W on my presets because I like you guys.  All right.  Please don't play that song again.  No, no, that's it.  You shan't hear that again.  All right, that was it.  Thank you.  All right.  You know what, though?  What?  I think someone out there should come up with a better Jets song.  I haven't heard a good one yet.  That's not hard.  Here.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  That's better.  Okay. 
[00:11:00]  That's the first attempt.  But we'll play Jets songs.  So you got all weekend to come up with something and get it to our studio before we go on the  air Monday.  Well, what if perished the thought, you know?  Oh, don't say it.  Don't say what you're thinking.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  That's the latest from Collective Soul, a little band from Stockbridge, Georgia.  That's heavy off the CD dosage.  It's Opie and Anthony on F.U.  Friday. 
[00:11:30]  I'm Jets getting married.  You see them going with this story?  Yeah.  Popeye's getting married to olive oil.  Well, blow me down.  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  You know the paper wrote that in?  Wait, I got to show you.  Oh.  Because you use that line all the time.  Hold on.  It's in the post on page three.  Look how they made that headline.  Why blow me?  And then the next line says, down.  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, maybe now I'll get some pussky.  Oh. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, go, go, go, go, go.  Don't have to worry about Brutusk.  Oh.  I always get slopsky seconds.  Popeye's getting married.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  She's a tights one.  Because she's so slensker.  Oh.  Oh, go, go, go.  Not much in the titsk.  No, no, not at all. 
[00:12:30]  I never understood Popeye's attraction to olive oil myself.  Oh.  You know.  She's got skannows like a butt plug.  Okay.  I can understand olive oil going for Popeye, though.  His mitzky member looks like those forearms.  Yeah, I always wonder when he did the spinach thing if his memory got really huge, like his biceps.  Well, blow me down.  Of course it did.  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, I got the little tattoos.  Got an anchor on my penis. 
[00:13:00]  There you have it.  Married.  Married, yeah.  And they're making a big story.  Like, they got people talking about where they should go on their honeymoon.  Hey, hey, hey, they're cartoons.  Yeah, they interviewed these people on the street in the post.  And it says, Carl from London, 41 years old.  I think it's a wonderful thing.  They should have done it a long time ago.  And maybe now we'll have little Popeye's running around.  Oh, yeah.  Look at Lewis.  Seeing how they've been together for a long time.  And they should get married. 
[00:13:30]  These people have more of an opinion about two cartoons than they probably would about Clinton.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't want to comment on that.  Oh, Popeye's married?  Yeah.  In cartoony land?  Right.  Sam from Brooklyn.  And I think they know each other very well.  I think it's time to consummate their relationship.  Oh, that's what I've been saying for years.  Pretty Hornsky.  And then Lewis Suhu. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, Dinka, Sukamari.  They be very happy.  They've been working at it for a long time now?  Yeah, whatever that means.  They're cartoons.  And then Janet, I don't see why they should change anything.  But as long as they're married, they should go somewhere nice and have a good honeymoon.  What?  If they didn't get married, where did the sweet pea come from?  Ew.  Remember, let's go sweet pea.  Yeah.  Ew.  He's a love child, like Clintons. 
[00:14:30]  A love child.  All right.  Well, I got a ton of F you Fridays here, Anthony.  You do?  They get a little brutal, though.  A little brutal.  All right.  Let's see.  Well, first of all, let's get it out of the way.  F the NBA.  Because that's what everyone is sending through the fax line.  So we'll get it out of the way.  Okay.  But a huge F you to Kenny Anderson.  Did anyone else see Warner Wolf last night?  Oh, I missed that clip.  Oh, my God.  He had footage of Kenny Anderson coming out of the hotel after the NBA strike was settled.  And these, I think it was two little kids are coming up and going, Mr. Anderson, can I have your autograph? 
[00:15:00]  Desperate, tiny little kids.  Oh.  And all of a sudden, Kenny goes, man, get out of my way.  I don't have time for this.  I'm trying to find my car, man.  Oh.  And they kept going and going.  And he practically pushed them away to go find his car.  Way to win back the fans there, Kenny.  Bravo.  All right.  Jesus.  Now, pompous guys, man.  Well, all right.  We got to read these.  What?  There's a guy out there that's very angry. 
[00:15:30]  If you're a faithful listener of our show, it's Angry Andrew, the Met fan.  Angry Andrew.  Yeah.  Every time we read one of his FUs, the bosses get a ton of complaint calls, and people are  convinced that we actually say this.  We're just reading the facts.  It's not our thoughts.  He faxed in.  He was the one who faxed in F. Joe DiMaggio, which is just like sacrilege in this town, obviously.  And he also had some problems with the Virgin Mary and our Lord Savior around Christmas time. 
[00:16:00]  We can't even mention those because the phones are still ringing about that.  Horrible.  Because you can't defend against that.  This guy's got problems.  So, Angry Andrew, the Met fan, he loves to give us FUs every Friday.  Would you like to hear his latest, Anthony?  Not sure, but go ahead.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  F. Yogi Berra.  The fact that he would possibly never go back to that S-hole in the Bronx was one of the few bright hopes in my life.  Now I have to pray for the big-eared, munchkin lookalike to die along with Joe DiMaggio. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, man.  That's Angry Andrew, the Met fan, saying that, not us.  Wow.  He said another one.  You read this one.  Why?  Because I'm not brave enough.  I'll admit it.  Let me see.  Just preface it by saying it's Angry Andrew, the Met fan.  Oh, no.  Come on now.  This is his FU.  Andrew, what's your problem?  He says F the chick who got thrown in front of the N-line? 
[00:17:00]  Why?  At 23rd.  Oh, I can't read this.  I can't say this.  You want me to say this?  Yeah, it's not coming from your mind.  You're just reading his FU.  Angry Andrew.  Yeah.  If that dumb blonde whore wasn't standing against the wall, I wouldn't be delayed for almost an hour and a half?  I also would have saved the $1.50 I had to spend on the bus?  Andrew, that's a person's life.  What's your problem?  That's Angry Andrew, the Met fan. 
[00:17:30]  Sorry you were delayed an hour and a half.  I think her and her family have bigger problems than you.  What's this guy's problem?  There you have it.  There you have it.  So keep the FUs coming in.  Angry Andrew.  My God.  212-957-WNEW.  He's got a doozy every Friday.  He certainly does.  From Matt and Bob, a big FU to John Thompson.  When the going gets tough, I quit.  That's right.  That news broke.  John Thompson, coach of Georgetown. 
[00:18:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  The Purple Space Truck Inn.  It's Opie and Anthony.  FU Friday in progress.  Getting lots of reports that people are pretty much stuck.  Just stuck in traffic.  Well, the morons come out on the road every time the snow falls, Opie.  Well, you didn't listen to me today.  What?  I said we should take the train today.  I know.  It was a perfect train day.  Anthony doesn't like getting on the train. 
[00:18:30]  I understand.  It's a hassle.  It's somewhat of a pain, yes.  I don't like walking out in the rain either, in snow.  You know, we'd have to walk out, stand out there for a cab or something, or walk over  the subway.  Oh, we'd have to be like real people.  No, no.  Real people that commute in like that.  There are plenty of real people that drive in, too.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean.  And do exactly what we do.  I was taking all the evasive maneuvers today.  You were good.  Oh, I was listening to 10-10 winds. 
[00:19:00]  Traffic.  I was listening to that.  But once they had their traffic right.  Opie.  What?  You know they got mad at you when you said that at the company party.  I know.  He goes up to the 10-10 winds people and goes, yeah, yeah, the traffic's never right.  It's right all the time.  That's their bread and butter, too.  Oh.  That's like complaining about the rock music at N.E.W.  Scott Herman, the boss, is going to come down here and kick your ass.  But they saved us probably two and a half hours today because we were ready to head into 
[00:19:30]  that mess on the LIA with the overturned tractor trailer.  Yeah.  That was blocking every single lane for two and a half hours.  Up by the fairgrounds westbound.  Yeah.  And then all the rubbernecking eastbound.  But, yeah, we hopped down the Grand Central.  Boom.  Right past.  And then the BQE.  BQE.  And then Queens Boulevard.  Queens Boulevard.  We were all over the ball field.  Oh, yeah.  I had confidence in you, but I just thought it was a good train day today.  Navigating.  Because there's always one a-hole that wrecks it for everyone else.  Yes, they do.  I think there should be public floggings. 
[00:20:00]  If you see them on the side of the road, you can stone them.  Yes.  Mayor Giuliani, if he really wants to clean up this city, he should have it fair game.  If you're the person that, you know, causes the accident and messes up everyone's commute  home, we are legally allowed to get out of our cars and pummel you.  People would drive a lot more careful.  Yeah, you'd be a lot more careful.  Yeah.  I think.  And I think the people driving slow in the left lane do just as much damage. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  I'll tell you why.  You know, you see somebody coming up on your rear and you don't move over?  Now they have to move over and swerve around you.  Mm-hmm.  What happens?  You hit that strip where the lines are, where the snow isn't melted.  Whoosh.  Yeah.  Spin around.  What about the Pied Piper maneuver?  What's that?  We were behind one of those today on the back roads.  One person has to go, I think, seven miles an hour because they can't handle the winter  weather. 
[00:21:00]  Uh-huh.  They're too scared to look out their rear view mirror to see a hundred cars behind them  with clear open road ahead of them.  But because they're scared of the winter weather and they're going seven miles an hour, everyone  else has to go seven miles an hour.  Believe me, I don't want to do 50 down the side roads, but I don't want to do three either.  But you know you can handle maybe 12 miles an hour.  Oh.  Woof, woof, woof.  Now we're crazy.  We're tooling. 
[00:21:30]  I just love that maneuver.  Yeah.  It goes right back to that thought, you know, that person thinks they're the only person,  you know, in the entire world.  Yeah.  Only person on the face of the earth.  Right.  You look at them.  They're still looking straight ahead.  You pull up next to them to give them a dirty look.  And they look at you like you have two heads, like, wow, what's wrong?  That's if they even look.  Yeah.  Usually they're just oblivious to everything.  They're looking straight ahead.  Peeping your horn.  You're pissed off.  You want to flip the bird.  They don't even look at you.  It's a parade of cars because of this one person.  A hundred cars behind them. 
[00:22:00]  Get out of the way.  If it's you right now, get out of the way.  Exactly.  Get out of the way.  Everyone look behind you right now.  Is there somebody real close that wants to pass you?  Get out of their way.  And you're looking ahead and there's, you know, open road.  You're the problem.  You're the problem.  F.U. Friday.  Send a fax.  212-957-WNEW.  F.U. to my boss for leaving work early and leaving everyone to trek home in the snow late.  Oh, that's brutal.  Nice to be the boss.  And Dan C. writes, I want to send a big F.U. to the Long Island Railroad. 
[00:22:30]  Why is that?  They always have an excuse about being late.  I know it will take three hours to get home tonight.  They need to change their slogan from going your way to sorry for the inconvenience because  that's all they ever say.  Good luck getting home tonight, Dan.  Tim has a problem with Christy Whitman.  F.U. for trying to end the college lifestyle we all know and love.  Alcohol is necessary for a proper education.  Bravo!  Her task force to eliminate college parties and fraternities. 
[00:23:00]  Ruining everything.  Whatever happened to Animal House and good, clean fun.  I agree, Tim.  Okay.  It is part of college.  I don't know.  I never went.  Phones are going nuts.  We'll go to them next.  All right.  We got that band, Indigenous.  I knew I was going to have a problem with that.  Indigenous.  Way to get your name out there, guys.  Little bonus for sticking through the commercials.  Later this hour, when you hear Dance the Night Away by Van Halen,  be the 10th caller to win a pair of tickets to see the Black Crows Tuesday night  at the Bowery Ballroom, plus a copy of their new CD, By Your Side. 
[00:23:30]  When you hear Van Halen, Dance the Night Away.  This is the only time I'm going to say it.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WADW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And there's our pal.  Yeah, that is a huge song for our show.  We get hundreds of requests a week for that.  That's our buddy, Red Peters.  And how's your whole family?  All right.  It's F.U. Friday.  Yeah.  I thought you were going to move on to something. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, we're trying here.  If you want to send in a fax, 212-957-WNEW.  Got a problem with Brian here from Hillsdale.  I'm sending a big F.U. to all the ass-face four-wheel drive morons  who think they can drive like butt monkeys because they're in a truck.  I hope I see you wrapped around a telephone pole so I can pull over and piss on your truck.  You guys rule the world, and if anyone in this country should be getting Hummers in an office, it's you.  Thanks, guys, Brian.  Let me tell you something, Brian. 
[00:24:30]  There's a bunch of us that have the sports utility trucks with the lovely four-wheel drive.  Yeah.  We can only take advantage of the four-wheel drive, what, ten times a year?  Yeah.  Let us have some fun.  You can blow past us when the road is dry.  Let us have some fun.  When it's nice in the summer, we see you going, blow right past us.  Yeah.  In the winter, get out of our way because it's our road.  In the winter, it's our road.  In the summer, it's your road.  The snow's falling.  Mm-hmm.  Get out of the way.  Exactly. 
[00:25:00]  Know how painful it is to have a sports utility truck,  and you're behind that lady going seven miles an hour on the side road,  and you're the next car and you can't get past her because there's traffic coming the other way?  Stepping on the gas and the rear end of her car is sliding to the right.  And there you are, ready to go?  Yeah.  Ready to go.  Want to see what this four-wheel drive could do?  Yeah.  And you can't use it?  It's painful.  So give us a break.  We know it doesn't help with the breaking on ice.  I've heard that before. 
[00:25:30]  You know, you're still sliding on the ice.  We know.  But when there's snow on the road and we're driving, we can go fast.  We can go faster.  Faster.  We still try to be careful, but we can go a little faster.  And we try to be careful.  So how many people forgot where their ice scraper was today?  Yeah.  Whoops.  Yeah.  I used the cassette case.  Yeah.  What cassette?  I don't know.  It was like at the bottom of my glove compartment.  Like an old Yes cassette or something?  It was with a winger.  Winger. 
[00:26:00]  It's poison.  Every spring, I throw away my ice scraper and my little brush.  Because I'm convinced it's never going to snow again when the spring hits.  Summer's coming.  It's so far away.  Why am I ever going to need a snow shovel again?  Anthony, what is the noise of the day?  I thought you'd never hear that sound again, huh?  How about this one, too?  Hmm.  I hate that. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  All right.  Jump your car.  Black girl's on the line?  Black girl.  What's wrong with black girl?  He's lost.  They got lost going to the Bowery Ballroom?  Yep.  In that mighty vehicle, the N.E.W. van?

We were told to go to the Mercury Lounge to pick up something, and then we were told to  come back.  Oh, I see.  How's the traffic out there, Earl?  Absolutely awful.  Really?  Oh, wow.  What a surprise.  I thought you were going to say it was clear sailing today.  No, it is absolutely terrible. 
[00:27:30]  People cannot drive.  Earl's our correspondent on the streets for the N.E.W. Storm Center.  Yeah.  He's in the N.E.W. Stormobile.  You're in the Stormobile.  We have Earl.

[00:31:00]  Well, you see in the paper, Rod Stewart  Yeah  Him and his wife called it quits  Yeah, what is  Rachel Hunter  What is wrong with Rod Stewart?  He's like Nosferatu  He's like Dracula  He latches on to these young girls  Uh-huh  Sucks them of their life  Yeah  Maybe a kid or two  And then ditches them  Gets them all out of shape  And moves on to the next hot strawberry blonde model  Yeah, Britt Eklund 
[00:31:30]  Uh-huh  And Kelly Ann Berg  Yep  And what made anybody think he was going to stop here at Rachel?

How old is she?  31?  29  29  29  See, she looks a lot older than 29  Oh, she definitely does  I thought she was older  Remember right after she had a kid?  She was on TV for something  Uh-huh  And she just, I mean, obviously she had just had a child and everything  She was really, really huge  And she never really recovered from that, I don't think

Remember when we had to play this during the air pollution  Oh, this raised a stink  They actually made us play this song  And act like we liked it  Meanwhile, Rachel Hunt is shriveling up  Like she's laid down next to a bean pod 
[00:33:00]  In Invasion of the Body Snatchers  And Rod just casts her aside  Just like the rest of them  Yep  Who's next?  He's going to start going out one of the Olsen twins  Right?

Kind of radar imaging?  I love when you're driving down the road  Behind some truck or station wagon

[00:44:30]  It's supposed to be me  The sweetest thing  You two on the Rock of New York  1027 WNEW  Bruce Springsteen before that  That's O.P. and Anthony  All right  And we put our foot in our mouths again  What happened?  Well, follow along, okay?  I'm following, okay  Remember when we first got here?  Oh, let me think back  Remember how bad this place blew when we got here?  Yeah  By the way, we're looking forward finally  We're not going to bitch as much  Because we got all the pieces just about in place 
[00:45:00]  Yeah  It's a new year  And we're ready to take on the world now  That's it  Our new morning show starts Thursday  Steve Mason  Check him out, okay?  Yeah  These guys have been in here  But remember when we first started  Remember the old jocks  Oh, yeah, yeah, please  Remember we went on the air every day  And bitched and complained about the old tired music  Yes  Remember?  Yes  The moldy oldies  The songs you've heard a thousand times  That you just don't care about  And we thought we were making some headway 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  We started playing some new songs  Yes  And then what happened to us, Anthony?  The air pollution of the rock of New York  So then we decided to spend a week  Playing all the oldie moldy crap once again  Just when we thought we were moving forward  And some of the old zombies started coming back again  Yeah  People that hated us and left  Yeah  But we put our foot in our mouth  Because we thought we were convinced  That we wouldn't have to play the oldie moldy stuff anymore  And then we got stuck playing that for a week  Yeah  Alright, we lost on that one  Then remember we started bitching and complaining 
[00:46:00]  About countdown shows that all the radio stations do  Yes  Yeah, yeah, yeah  The top 500  The firecracker 500  Right  Coming up this 4th of July weekend  We're going to count down the top 500  Which is such a waste of time  Because the listeners don't get a chance  To vote for their favorite songs and stuff  It's just a last  They put numbers in front of it  And make believe they did all this work  It's lazy radio programming  So we bitched about that  And what did they do?  New Year's Eve, what happened? 
[00:46:30]  Top 99 rock albums of all time  Which, by the way, was successful  Because we did allow the listeners  To pick their favorite albums  Right  That was true  But we put our foot in our mouth again  But I want to know what you're getting at here  Because  Oh, it's brutal  Why, it's something else  Well, yeah  How did we feel about the NBA strike?  We thought  A bunch of clowns  Mm-hmm  All the players  Greedy  Mm-hmm  The owners are a bunch of jerk-offs, too  Right  And the fans are the ones that are getting hurt 
[00:47:00]  Right  And they settled it  But  Damn it  I mean, just  Don't  Don't go to the games  Don't go to the games  Right  We've been telling people for a week  For the love of God  Don't even watch them on TV  For the love of God  You know, make a stand  Against the owners and the players  Right  Right  And I even said  I'm not going to watch  Or go to a game for a while at least  Uh-huh  At least  And you know how big of a fan I am  So  So where does this fit in?  So we stuck our schlongs out on the line once again  Okay  And I just see here that, uh, Roger 
[00:47:30]  The marketing director of NEW  Yeah  Has added something to the  Things to know and tell  She  What is it?  When the NBA gets ready to play  We'll have tickets to give away  Stay tuned to WNEW  The Rock of New York  We can't win  We can't win  So we bitched about that  Now we're giving people tickets to go to the games  Yeah  Oh, okay  That makes sense  So  But in a way  In a way I guess it's cool 
[00:48:00]  Because you won't have to pay the  The stupid prices for the tickets  They'll be free  I guess  There's a positive little spin on it  We can't win  1027 WNEW  The Rock of New York  Hero of the day  From the Lode CD  Pink Floyd  Before that  It's Opie and Anthony  And Popeye  Hanging with us  Today  On me wedding day  I can't wait  To get into Olive's Girl

[00:55:30]  Ben the fag  Whatever  I think he got most of it  Until he uh  He cursed  Oh well  He keeps on calling back  He  Why are you missing me?  Well  While the music's playing  Anthony and I are just  Randomly calling people  In Jacksonville  And really screwing with that  And he came up with a  Good reason why  They're called  Jacksonville  Yeah I tell the people  Well it's Jacksonville  Because uh  Years ago  The founding fathers  Would jack their sons  Hence 
[00:56:00]  Jacksonville  What you mean?  Of course  We do that  And you wonder why  None of these are on the air  Because every single one  Is cursing so much  That we can't  We just can't get it on the air  M or F  Right  Fish hand  Jaguars  Jaguars  Jaguars  Going to beat the Jets  What a laugh  Alright  Jaguars  A big pussy  That's all it is  That's all it is 
[00:56:30]  Alright  Where were we?  Because I was hoping  That guy would  Hang with us a little bit  But yeah  We're going to get  An intelligent conversation  Out of a guy from  Jacksonville  Alright  Maybe he'll call back  Oh sure  F you to the  Whimpering gluttons  For abuse  Who call themselves  NBA fans  Here's some news  It's a business  You might as well  Root for IBM  To beat Compaq  Van from Manhattan  We do  It's called the stock market  Which did well 
[00:57:00]  Again today  Yeah  Oh man  I had a close call  With Amazon  Today  You were  Oh my god  Anthony you're nuts  Oh my god  Amazon was up today  Yeah  Like 30 points  At one point  It's like 199  Right  And I punched out  Just in time  Before the bottom  Fell out  You got in at 150  Yeah  Little 150 option  Yeah  Bought a couple  Yeah  And then it went up  To 199  I punched out  At like 180  And then the bottom 
[00:57:30]  Fell out  And it lost all  Its gains  It made today  And closed at what  At 160  And no one could  Understand why  Amazon.com  Is going through the roof  Well that's why  It's got these peaks  And valleys like this  And you can play them  But you might as well  You know  It's either do that  Or go play blackjack  Or the slides  Because people  There's no rhyme  Or reason to it  People are confused  Because this stock  Has split three ways  Yeah the value  Of the stock  Is supposed to be  One of the analysts  Came out and said  $400 a share  Before it's split  They go  This is going to be  A $400 stock 
[00:58:00]  Okay  It gets pushed up  Pushed up  Close to 400  They split three ways  Right  So you divide  400 by three  And that's what  Your top  Of the stock should be  That's what the price  Should be  133  133  Boom  It goes up to  150  160  180  199  And you got in at 150  So now  You figure it this way  $200  $199  $200  It was up to  At one point today  That split three ways  That's $600 value 
[00:58:30]  On the original stock  And this is all  From a company  That hasn't shown  Profits in the last year  No  Or two years  It's not  It's not planning  And no one  No one can understand  It's because  Everyone is just  Shoving money into it  Because it's such  A popular stock  It's a fun thing  For the day traders  And the real  The people with the  Iron wills  To play with  Because you could  Really get burned  On this one  Really burned  That's why now  You know  You watch the real stock  That people  Oh he's calling back  Stay in for a while  And you're going to  Raise by a 16th  And you're psyched 
[00:59:00]  Is he back?  Hello?

[01:00:00]  Grandmother's fault  Right  Who I love dearly  She's 88  And she listens to us  Uh oh  She doesn't like  When we make fun of  Chelsea Clinton  Oh  Because she doesn't deserve it  And leave her alone  Because she's suffered enough  Like Chelsea listens  To our radio show  Is this what you have to  Listen to when you go  I don't even go to  Family functions anymore  Yeah  Between the aunts  And my grandmother  I have to talk to you  My aunt goes  I've been listening  To your radio show  I don't like what I hear
