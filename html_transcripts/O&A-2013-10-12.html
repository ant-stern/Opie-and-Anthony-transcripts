<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Sam Roberts hosting the "Worst of the Week" segment, featuring numerous callers and in-studio guests.  A significant portion focused on comedian Carl criticizing Opie and Anthony's interviewing style, particularly their poorly-received interview with Michael Shannon. The hosts defended their approach.  Big A and his dentist, Dr. Brian, then joined the show, detailing Big A's extensive, and graphically described, dental work complicated by his severe gag reflex. E-Rock's reactions to this were notable.

Vanilla Ice was a guest, discussing his house-flipping business, including plans for a 4D IMAX home theater. He recounted his experience living with the Amish for a reality TV show, detailing their customs, tools, and social dynamics.  Rich Voss was also in studio and participated in the discussion.  Commercial breaks were interspersed throughout.  Upcoming guests Russell Peters and Michelle Beadle were mentioned. The musician Vanilla Ice also discussed the immense financial success of his hit song, "Ice Ice Baby,"  and his Amish barn-raising experience, including using an Amish buggy and charging his equipment at a Walmart.

The "Jocktober" segment followed, featuring a scathing, highly offensive critique of a Cincinnati morning show hosted by Jeff, Jen, and Fritch.  The hosts analyzed the show's content and Facebook page, highlighting offensive material.  A phone call with Rich Voss, who was in the studio, led to a discussion of his gambling habits and past addiction struggles, with a lighthearted intervention from the hosts and caller Colin Quinn.  Michelle Beadle, Russell Peters, and Pete Holmes were mentioned as having been in studio earlier.

A phone call with Colin Quinn was followed by in-studio guests Pete Holmes, Michelle Beadle, and Russell Peters.  The conversation initially centered on the TV show *Homeland*, deemed "stinky" by some.  Colin Quinn's call was praised.  The hosts then discussed a Myers-Briggs personality test (audio to be aired later on the podcast), and promoted Jim Florentine and Jonathan Stone's podcasts.  Pete Holmes promoted his upcoming late-night show, leading into a lengthy, explicit conversation about sex, fetishes, pornography, and the death of Ariel Castro, filled with graphic descriptions and humorous anecdotes.

The "Worst of the Week" segment returned, with Michelle Beadle and Russell Peters in studio. They discussed Beadle's cancelled shows, social media's impact on privacy, and their careers, including extensive banter about Peters' appearance and opinions.  Peters discussed his Netflix special and plans to travel to the Middle East.  Numerous advertisements were interspersed.

A rambling conversation then ensued, featuring vulgar and sexually explicit discussions about genitalia, E-Rock's anger over Opie giving out his phone number, descriptions of bodily functions, anxieties, drug use, sexual preferences, and a detailed recounting of a vacation.  Sam Roberts was present and contributed.  Jim Florentine's podcast and the NFL were also discussed.

The show concluded with a rant criticizing NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's decisions to stop games due to weather, using exaggerated scenarios and Doppler radar imagery,  and highlighting the high cost of tickets and PSLs. A humorous anecdote about Goodell's limousine getting stuck in a Newark flood concluded the segment.  Numerous commercial breaks and mentions of other SiriusXM programming, including Jim Florentine's podcast, were interspersed throughout the broadcast.

It's caused by water, attracted by the ethanol that's in your gas tank right now.  Ethanol is in nearly every gallon of retail gas.  It attracts 50% more water than unleaded.  And with water, that means corrosion can begin at any time. 
[00:02:30]  But you can protect your engine with the BG ethanol defender service.  BG cleans, dries, and protects the entire fuel system.  And you can find this service at a shop near you at BGfindashop.com.  Remember these two letters.  BG.  This is the worst week we've done.  When we take the best of this week's O.P. Anthony show, call it the worst,  and then count it down for your listening pleasure.  Here's your host, what's his name, face?  Welcome, welcome. 
[00:03:00]  You know what time it is.  It's the weekend.  It's the worst of the week countdown here on the O.P. and Anthony channel.  And I'm Sam Roberts.  All of this you know.  What you don't know is what I've decided to put on the countdown this week.  We will hear from Colin Quinn, Rich Voss, Pete Holmes, Michelle Beadle, Russell Peters, Vanilla Ice, and more.  We will get resolution to the fact that E-Rock's cell phone number was given out on the air last week.  Jock-tober, and a whole lot more. 
[00:03:30]  What we're going to start with is Colin Quinn.  He called in to the show this week to let O.P. and Anthony know how much their interviews stink.  His opinions, not mine.  That's right, Colin Quinn.  I see you.  I see you tweeting at me.  I'm tweeting you back.  I take none of your guff, and I don't give a care either.  Colin Quinn calls in to the O.P. and Anthony show to start the worst of the week countdown.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Yes, let's go to the phones right now and talk to the lovely and talented Carl. 
[00:04:00]  I heard you guys were trashing me this morning.  Well, not really.  What a problem is told me.  Is it a trashing if it's completely accurate?  Well, I guess it depends on your definition of what accurate is.  We took umbrage with your criticism of our interviewing abilities.  Well, all I know is when I saw you guys in that Michael Shannon interview, I literally  was cringing by myself in a car and wanted to drive off the highway. 
[00:04:30]  That's how you should feel all the time.  And that's what you should do.  What was wrong with that interview?  Why don't you play a little bit of it for the fans and they can watch stilted, toxic air.  It was horrible.  Why?  You didn't?  Let the fans be the judge.  I let that interview speak for itself.  I let that interview speak for itself.  You didn't think it was informative and respectful? 
[00:05:00]  It was overly respectful, which all three of you have to do sometimes.  Everybody except your friends.  What are we supposed to do?  Jump down their fucking throats and be confrontational with everybody?  I said, as I said before, on the one hand, you guys, two minutes before that, you got  Bobo, you're spanking Bobo over the console.  And you're like, so let me ask you.  And they even said, like, this shows, this is something false is going on.  I don't know.  Something false.  You're watching Michael Shannon go, yes, guys. 
[00:05:30]  Well, anyway, speaking of, you know, Hollywood, small talk, happy horseshit.  And then even he said, why are these guys, these are like little kids that are causing  trouble.  And the minute the parent comes in, they try to act like it's normal.  I hate when Colin says things like this, because I think he's right.  No, I think that Colin is just jealous of our interviewing skills, and he doesn't like  that we get to the bottom of things.  Well, I don't like, no, as I said the other day, which hopefully they played for Norton,  because he wasn't there. 
[00:06:00]  I did not hear it.  Norton might be the worst, because he actually comes in with like a personal, he thinks that  his personal history, which is like, I watched this show, is enough.  He doesn't think of any questions, his research could ever take, like I said, the night before  he said he goes to bed and just goes, ah, that's enough that I watched it.  And he goes, in scene three, when they blow his brains out, so the guy knows he watched  all five seasons.  That's right.  But still, you can take the time to think of like an angle on the question.  I do have, you'd be, I have paperwork, I have lots of questions. 
[00:06:30]  I come in with a printed out, I usually have a minimum of ten questions.  Jim does have prepared questions.  He does?  Yes.  Yes.  Like, okay, right now, the Colin Quinn interview, question one, why are you a douche?  I don't, I mean, I have an answer for that, because all my life, no matter what pleasantries  were going on in my life, I got more pleasure out of breaking the ball.  Well, obviously.  If it wasn't, it really made me enjoy my existence and wake up in the morning. 
[00:07:00]  You should just enjoy life there, Carl.  I was so happy when I heard you guys are cheering me this morning.  We were just correcting your incorrect assessment of our interview abilities, which I think  was stellar.  I'm not going to argue.  I want that interview replay.  You call it disjointed.  We call it being multifaceted.  That's right, Carl.  No, it's not disjointed.  Just the whole energy is just uncomfortable.  I mean, that guy's obviously, you know, whatever his thing is, too.  But it was just, oof.  Well, you know, he's kind of an odd fellow, and it wasn't one of these guys that you could 
[00:07:30]  just bring.  All the interviews have that.  No, some, most people we can.  How about our Quentin Tarantino interview?  All right.  Our long Quentin Tarantino interview.  Yes.  Well, since you guys have done like 2,000 interviews, and you can only think of one as a good example.  Most people we can bring into the show, you know, you got a guy like...  No, that's exactly what you can't do, exactly.  No, and we discuss things...  They wouldn't understand the show. 
[00:08:00]  They can't be brought in, because they'd be horrified.  So, are you saying that Roland should be fired, and we should not have any more guests to interview?  No, I think it's part of the charm of the show.  Oh, now it's charm.  The whole audience is sitting there waiting for them to leave, so the funds are sitting there  waiting for them to turn the lights out of the show.  Are you talking about when you're in?  A call is, wow, very critical of what we're doing here. 
[00:08:30]  Getting to the bottom of things.  I like the fact you dummies are actually offended, like,  Hey, geez, what do you think, you're Charlie Rose?  Shut up.  Who cares?  What, do you want to be a good interviewer, guys?  Insightful interviewer?  Shut up.  Who cares about being a good interviewer?  Well, that's not a skill.  That's not a skill.  Only our country thinks that's a skill.  Really?  Yes, who cares?  Being able to have an instant rapport with somebody isn't a skill? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, that'd be phony and weird if you had that.  Yeah.  Oh, no, we all have it.  Maybe for you.  We have it with, yes, exactly.  We have it with an audience every night, don't we?  Yes.  Yes, so the audience is different.  Why?  Because that's a different, that's an actual skill set.  You're a loner.  Yeah, exactly.  You're just a loner.  Yeah, Lone Wolf McQueer.  Do you have any real friends, Carl?  Yeah.  Or just the comedian guys? 
[00:09:30]  All of a sudden you hear just tears and a shotgun blaster.  Well, I tried to, no.  I did have real friends, but I certainly, I treated comedian guys better than I treated  my real friends.  Yeah.  And all for nothing, of course.  Well, yeah, all for naught.  You never get that back, do you?  No, you know.  From those guys.  They're heartless, fucking emotionless, dreck.  Most of them are, most of them are disloyal, forget who helped them creeps, assholes. 
[00:10:00]  I saw Gravity last night, you want to talk about that?  Gravity?  Oh, you saw that.  What'd you think?  I saw some of your tweets.  I saw a visual, yeah, visual, well, anyway.  Was it a smorgasbord for the eyes?  It was.  Was it good?  How was Sandra Bullock?  Oh, my heaven, jeez.  I can see her winning an award for this, I'll be honest with you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what about the great George Clooney?  Well, being nominated, oh, I mean, this guy's just eye candy for the girls. 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  Really?  He even looks handsome in a space suit?  You know what?  You're right.  Actually, this is why we should have Gunnler's hand.  We didn't right now, he'd put a bullet in my mouth right now.  Hey, did I ever tell you my joke about space?  Oh, no.  No, what is it, Chip?  When I was a kid, my mother said, Chip, you want to be an astronaut because in school  you're taking up a bunch of space.  I remember that joke.  He's so...  Oh, it's not really good joke. 
[00:11:00]  It's your mother's joke.  Yeah, but I would just retell it to get gales of laughter.  Gales of...  I think Edgar should be in a space suit.  See, he sounds like he's moving around in, like, zero traffic.  I fly planes.  You do it?  Of course, it's April Falls.  I should have seen that coming.  Kyle, what was the next big guest?  Just tell me the next big guest coming up.  Well, we have our friend Russell Peters today and Michelle Beadle. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, Michelle.  Tell Michelle Beadle thanks for blowing me off the other night when I was doing that goddamn  pre-fucking game thing on PIX the other day.  Yeah, what happened?  I was going to ask you, what the hell was that?  I saw...  Today, you and Michelle Beadle are shocked.  She's not there.  She'll tell us thanks.  What did you do on that PIX thing?  Oh, just a couple of zingers about the Jets and Giants.  Yeah?  Did they go over?  Yeah, sure.  Nice.  Fans trash me good when I leave.  That's one good thing about Twitter.  They would give you a nice review. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, they're always very nice and complimentary, aren't they?  You know shit about football.  Please don't ruin the game again.  Your feet look horrible.  They're fucking terrible, aren't they?  Awful people.  How are you doing?  All right, guys.  Have a great show, but why don't you replay that Michael Shannon thing?  The fans can really use it.  We'll replay some of it.  I think we can.  Why don't we replay a little bit and see if it's... 
[00:12:30]  Sure.  I think Kyle is being a little harsh and a little jealous of our interviewing prowess.  Get into the meat of it in the middle, and you'll see how wonderful a job we did.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  On the Opie Anthony Channel, The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Yes, indeed.  The Worst of the Week Countdown is what it is, and Sam Roberts is who I am.  Highlighting everything good that happened this week on the Opie Anthony Show.  Still to come, Jocktober.  E-Rock, some resolution. 
[00:13:00]  Where's he at after his cell phone number was given out on the air last week?  Michelle Beetle's in studio.  Vanilla Ice is in studio.  Russell Peters is in studio.  All that's still to come.  First, we'll go to Big A.  We haven't heard from Big A in a while.  Big A has been on the show for many, many years.  He's a large man with a stuttering problem and breath that historically has not been the greatest.  He came in with his dentist.  It turns out his dentist is a big O&A fan.  He wanted to visit the show, and when we found this out, we said we have to meet the man who examines Big A's mouth for a living. 
[00:13:30]  Big A and his dentist.  Believe it or not, in studio, here on The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number.  Let's get Big A in here.  We're running out of showtime.  Come on, Big A.  And we also have Pete Holmes coming in a little later, who's going to have the slot after Conan O'Brien.  But first, it's Big A and his dentist, Dr. Brian.  Dr. Brian.  Look at this brave man, Dr. Brian. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Big A.  How are you, brother?  Big A, pretty good.  How's your night going, Big A?  You slip it off a little bit?  Yeah, just a little bit, but it's not easy.  No, it's hard.  It's not easy.  What's been going on with that?  Anytime.  Nothing much.  I'm trying to keep eating the right thing and doing the right thing. 
[00:14:30]  Does he go through a lot of pain before he can say ouch to you?  You're drilling a tooth and he's like...  How?  The ST word's our problem.  He's trying to tell me to stop.  Continue.  So what's up with this relationship with the dentist?  How long have you been going there, Big A? 
[00:15:00]  How long?  About two years, I have to thank you.  I'm like a good friend, Dr. St.  Oh, no.  Wait, who?  Dr. St.  I wish it was Kevorkian.  Not really.  Dr. St.  The tongue is just fucking...  I know, did you see that?  I've never seen it happen before.  Dr. Who?  Dr. St.  Let's try this.  Go like this.  Put your teeth together.  Can you go...  Can you go...  Longer. 
[00:15:30]  Steve.  Yeah.  Keep it.  Keep it.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I swear I stopped breathing.  I hold my breath when he talks.  That is crazy.  So it's been two years.  And Dr. Brian, welcome to the show.  Yes.  Your first thoughts on Big A when it came into your office, thanks to Dr. Steve.  Yeah, so I know Dr. Steve was looking for some help with his medical condition, so I figured 
[00:16:00]  out...  You sound like Stinky.  What?  Is that good or bad?  Yeah, man.  You'll hear it.  I hear it.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That's really creepy to me.  I didn't hear that.  Anyway.  Is that good or bad?  It's good.  We love Stinky.  He works for...  Jay Thomas.  Is he still over there?  Works for Jay Thomas.  Over with Jay Thomas.  So it turns out we were trying to get in here and get a nice result.  It was a work in progress.  Work in progress.  I wanted to try and have this big makeover come in. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  He's awesome.  But financially, you got...  I got that.  I got some other issues we had to deal with, so...  Oh, you couldn't just whitewash it.  This is a foundation problem.  Yeah, we got...  Other issues?  This isn't just a paint job.  So what'd you see for the first time when you opened that mouth?  Yeah, yeah.  Walk us through it.  I was a little nervous first time.  I'll see you on the beaches.  Right.  Because you guys definitely painted him as a little bit of a monster, so I made sure  the waiting room was cleared out.  Oh, my God!  We brought him in the back door, and we got him in this chair. 
[00:17:00]  And I know you guys were wondering how we could handle this, how I could handle this.  Well, the trick was we had to actually bring in two other dentists.  We had three of us.  Wow!  That's like when they separate conjoined twins.  They fly in surgeons from all over the world.  It's like it was a 28-hour surgery.  Yeah.  We had like a pit crew going on.  Yeah.  As it turned out, we wanted to at least get a baseline and say, all right, let's do some  x-rays.  Let's take an exam.  Wow.  We couldn't get really close to him.  Why couldn't he get close to him? 
[00:17:30]  Well, actually, the biggest problem was, I don't know if you guys know, he has like a  very bad gag reflex.  Wow.  So he was just trying to like look at his front teeth.  He was gagging.  Wow.  Let alone trying to get in the back of the mouth.  Wait, can you make that happen right now?  Oh, yeah.  Because we've never seen that before.  You know, like a tongue depressor or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, just tell the tongue.  It's a sad story.  I was trying to figure out how to make a tongue depressed, but I think...  That is Mr. Tongue.  Oh, no.  How about like a plastic spoon or something?  Yeah, or a cock.  No, no, no.  No, here's a freshly wrapped handle on a plastic knife. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, how about this thing with the trigger on it?  Let's see.  I don't know.  He might associate this with food and they might not gag as much.  Oh, that's true.  Wait, he gags when you're just looking at his front teeth?  Yeah.  Now he's actually getting better.  That's why it's been such a work in progress.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now we got it going.  All right.  I don't even think he could brush his teeth at first, honestly.  Wow.  So it was a gag reflex problem.  Now he's doing better.  He's brushing his teeth and he's getting on trash.  What's that about, Big A?  Isn't that ironic that his gag reflex made other people gag through Foxy? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, what is that?  What is that?  What is that?  Big Sweetie.  Were you like...  Yeah, was something put in your mouth that you didn't like?  Yeah, I knew Jimmy was going to go down that road.  Oh.  Not at all.  Because I was always afraid of...  Speak up.  I was always afraid of dentists.  It's a little low.  Yeah.  Why were you afraid of the dentist?  Big guy like you?  Yeah, you big lug.  What did the dentist do? 
[00:19:00]  Because I was always gagging.  That's why I was always afraid of dentists.  You're an anti-dentite.  Let's see his gag reflex.  Dr. Brian.  Let's see.  Take a look.  He's been working on Big A for a long time.  Big tongue depressor.  Big day, stage.  Okay.  Let's see if I'm looking at the back teeth here.  Let's look.  He's looking.  He's looking.  He's looking pretty good.  He's holding it down with a knife.  He's really gagging.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What's on there?  Oh, wow. 
[00:19:30]  There's a lot of white on there.  Oh, my God.  Leave that knife that way.  Don't drop it.  Don't leave it there.  Don't drop it.  Don't drop it.  Big day.  Leave it there.  Hold on.  Don't throw it out.  Did you brush Big A?  Don't throw it out.  Yeah, I brushed it out.  E-Rock.  Someone got to put it over there.  Put it over there.  What is that?  Oh, E-Rock.  It's a black knife, and now it's like covered in white stuff.  Well, there's...  What is that, Doc?  What is that?  It's just a very thick saliva that he has.  Oh, my God.  That's another barrier to treatment that we've experienced.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:20:00]  I know.  I know.  E-Rock's the best.  You've got to get the mic, too.  There's probably nothing.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  That's the knife.  See that on the knife?  You've got to get the microphone.  That was...  E-Rock, what is that?  I guess on his tongue.  It's a tongue scraping.  No, he didn't scrape his tongue, really.  No, he just kind of poked around a little.  Poked around a little bit.  It looks like snot.  No, it's not.  Oh, my God.  It's snot.  I swear I'm having a problem. 
[00:20:30]  Holy fuck.  I'm not even near it, and that's a problem.  Really?  Just to look at it.  Oh, well, give it a sniff.  Well, should we do a true tongue scraping?  Well, let's see.  No, this would be good, I think.  Give a little smell.  We want to hear it, too.  Because this is incidental.  I want to hear...  Don't worry, big guy.  Eric.  It's crystallizing.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  It's not that bad.  It's more the idea of it.  It's better.  Andrew's better.  Yeah, I think Jim's right. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, okay.  I think it's more the idea.  Yeah, do it again.  All right.  Give it a kiss.  Give it a kiss.  Give it a kiss.  If this is more the idea of it.  Lick it, Iraq.  Just lick it.  Oh, fuck you.  He is trying even a bit.  Oh, he is.  Oh, Iraq.  You okay?  Oh, no.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You just threw up.  Is it more the idea of it?  No, but when you linger.  I'm staying away.  Okay, when you linger.  Thank you. 
[00:21:30]  Where's our girl intern?  I wish she was here.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, it's more the idea of it.  Not quite the makeover I was looking for, but.  No, no.  Slow steps.  All right.  So anyway.  Slow steps.  Baby steps.  You do the initial exam.  So we can't even do the exam because he's gagging so much.  So we actually had to send him out to another office.  That's how the other dentists got involved to do an extra oral exam with like a panoramic  x-ray that goes around the head.  Oh, that's that thing.  You sit there and it's got like this x-ray looking thing and it spins around the outside 
[00:22:00]  of your head.  Wow.  Pretty cool.  What?  You couldn't put any bite wings in his mouth?  No.  Couldn't get him in there.  Wow.  Really, Andrew?  So he would look at the front teeth like that and he would gag?  Yep.  Yep.  Just coming by his lips.  And then over time, he's getting better now.  I can actually work on it.  Oh, yeah.  You were just in there with a fucking knife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His teeth look good, by the way.  They're getting better.  They're getting better.  So what was the initial report?  So then actually, so to do the exam, we actually had to sedate him.  Like literally IV sedation.  Because we knew he was going to, on the x-ray, we knew he had some work to be done. 
[00:22:30]  So we said, all right, we'll get him sedated.  Holy shit.  Get this work done and the exam at the same time.  So we're going to just do a bunch of stuff.  And that's like the idea of like the pit crew.  We've got the sedation dentist.  Yeah, to put him out, it's like when they fucking, when they drank a fucking hip hole.  We used like Versa.  We just used like a light sedation.  And I was on one side.  The other guy was on the other side.  We were just going to get everything cleaned up.  Was it good, Big A?  Was it good?  Did you get zooted?  A little zooted?  A little bit, yeah.  Nice.  And then what, so what was the first thing you had to really do? 
[00:23:00]  What's the first thing you said?  The first thing you did.  Well, I want the laundry list of shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He needs done.  He basically, you know, had broken teeth.  Most of his molars were broken.  I think he's only got one or two left now.  Jeez.  And so we had to go in there and get those broken pieces out.  Basically get them nice and numb.  His whole mouth numb.  He's sedated.  Pick up those pieces of brain and skull.  You've got to sop that shit up.  Don't worry about it.  It's Pulp Fiction.  Then we, and then we just did a deep cleaning too. 
[00:23:30]  His gums, his gingiva was actually probably two or three times the size it should be.  It was just overgrown, like swelled up just from not being cleaned.  Wow.  So that was one thing we're trying to do was shrink his gums by getting them nice and clean.  Got him a regimen of mouth rinses and just actually brushing his teeth and getting the basics down.  Were you not brushing your teeth because of your gag reflex?  I was probably not as good as I should.  As thoroughly.  Should have.  How often were you doing it?  Honestly.  Once a year. 
[00:24:00]  And like just the front tooth, round and round, shook-a, shook-a, shook-a.  Yeah.  And that was it.  You weren't getting back under there, right?  And brushing the tongue and stuff.  Probably not as good.  How often were you doing it?  At a bad point, how often?  A couple times a week.  That means once a week.  Yeah, that's bad.  Dr. Brian, so that was it, though?  There were no cavities?  There were no...  Surprisingly, he had maybe one or two cavities.  Yeah.  So sometimes if we see that with patients, they'll just have either really bad gums or really 
[00:24:30]  bad cavities.  Their whole mouth just has cavities.  That's good.  So that was actually all right.  And then since then, we've had a couple other things pop up.  Because actually, the gums, because they're so large, were actually protecting his teeth,  keeping the debris off of his teeth.  Because he was actually protecting the teeth.  That's why his single's head said, man with big gums seeks friend.  Gums were grown...  Like when a fucking tree engulfs a sign over the course of a hundred years, that's pretty  much what his gums were doing to his teeth. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  His teeth were disappearing?  Yeah.  I mean, he probably covered the bottom...  At least the bottom third of his teeth just all around him.  Wow.  Holy moly.  Holy moly.  So what did it look like when you just scraped it out?  So just a lot of bleeding.  I think Andrew just sent a...  He just tweeted a picture of it.  Like, well, the first visits, I mean, afterwards, he was just...  We had to just pack cotton in there because there was so much bleeding.  Cotton makes you gag, right?  That cotton makes me gag.  I can't stand the cotton in the mouth.  I can't handle it.  It's...  Yeah, they shove it in there if it goes too far back. 
[00:25:30]  It feels dry.  It's the texture of it.  Oh, I can't...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Horrible.  What?  I sleep with cotton.  Of course you do.  You have a very dry mouth, Edgar.  What is that?  Edgar, I brought you a gift here.  Oh, Edgar has a gift from the dentist here.  What is it?  Bitten.  No, it's not bitten.  But it's bitten.  What is it called, Doc?  What is it?  It's biotin.  Biotin.  And what does it do?  It's for dry mouth.  Ah, it's a mouth rinse.  Gives you a little moisture.  I don't like it.  You need it, Edgar. 
[00:26:00]  Your mouth is very...  It's not persin.  Your mouth is very dry.  Shit.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the Colt and Anthony channel.

[00:31:00]  E-Rock is back from vacation after his cell phone number was given out on the air last week.  What kind of repercussions does he have in store for Opie?  Michelle Beadle and Russell Peters in studio.  Rich Voss in studio.  Jock-tober and more.  First, Vanilla Ice was in studio.  He's more than the guy who sang Ice Ice Baby.  He also sang Ninja Rap.  What's he got now?  He's surviving, baby.  No time like the present for Vanilla Ice, right?  Right. 
[00:31:30]  Here he is on the countdown.  Yeah.  Number six.  Vanilla Ice back on the show.  Looking good.  What are you guys?  How's everybody doing, man?  Hello.  Rich Voss.  Hey, guys.  What's happening, man?  Hey, I'm just marinating, man.  And Jim Norton, I don't think you guys met last time.  I think Jimmy was out.  Jimmy was out last time?  I was out.  Yeah, Vanilla Ice is great.  How you been, man?  Good?  I'm hanging in there, Bubba.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get in where you fit in.  You smell good, too. 
[00:32:00]  He smells good, right?  Yeah, it's early in the morning.  Wait till the end of the day.  Yeah.  Don't distinguish his facial features are, and then look at Norton.  Just, he's like Rock Quarry, and he's just like a fucking mess.  I don't like that you couldn't pull out a better reference than mess after a good one  like Rock Quarry.  A lot of love in the room.  Yeah.  Honestly.  What Voss is saying, basically, is that he's attracted to Vanilla Ice, and that's how he  was telling you.  Hey, hey, we're not that friendly.  Don't go there.  No, babe.  Please.  I'll tear up a set, man.  Don't make me go there.  Now, last time you were here, you were like doing something with homes and shit. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  You're like pimping them out, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I've been doing that 18 years, man.  But that's the Vanilla Ice Project.  Right.  Where I'm doing shows in Florida.  We take those houses that have been sitting in good neighborhoods that are kind of rotten,  sitting there for three years, foreclosures, short sales, and turn them back from zero  to zero.  Oh, you're flipping some shit.  Flipping houses, man, and putting in all the new cool house features and state-of-the-art  stuff, man.  How much does it cost to flip a house if it's totally, like, Detroit has houses that  are just such shit?  God. 
[00:33:00]  There's so many in Detroit.  They'll come back, though.  It'll all come back.  But that's got to be, like, why wouldn't someone just go in there, buy up a shitload of houses  for dirt cheap and see what you can do?  Well, because they've got to sit on and pay the property tax until they're fixed and sold.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody knows something here.  He knows how to flip a house.  You don't want to sit around that.  No, he's actually just destroyed enough homes where he knows how to flip a house.  That's all you got when me and Vanilla Ice were talking house.  You had to set me between you two guys, huh? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah, I know.  They're going at each other.  Yeah, but it does seem like if a house is that cheap, like they're going for in Detroit,  that even if you would have to pay some taxes for a little while, you know, you have to  do that anyway when you flip a house, right?  Well, you know, it used to be really good where you could just come in and buy a house  kind of below the appraised value and maybe change the carpet or put some paint and just  put a for sale sign up.  But now, you know, they've been sitting for, I had one, last season was sitting seven years.  Oh, God. 
[00:34:00]  It was rotten.  There were snakes, cockroaches, and rats coming out of the walls, man.  It was pretty bad.  But, you know, it's good TV.  You get it there and you flip them, you turn them around and put all the bells and whistles.  I'm building the first home 4D IMAX theater.  Oh, man.  It's going to be true.  What's 4D, by the way?  It's the same as 3D, but without the glasses.  And it works in conjunction with the screen.  It's an electronic screen.  And it's got, like, four layers, so it kind of gives you that depth.  Oh, wow.  It's pretty cool stuff, man.  Do they have TVs like that or just, like, pull-down screens? 
[00:34:30]  It's a screen that goes with the projector.  They work in conjunction.  Does it look great?  They've got it figured out?  Yeah, they've got it figured out.  It's amazing.  But the thing is, it's going to be obsolete because it doesn't come out until 2015.  And then I just saw it in Vegas.  They have this electronic show.  And they've got this freaking wallpaper TV, 1080p.  And you can just, the whole wall, it goes around corners.  It looks like Times Square.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And it clears a bell.  And you just connect it to the next one, and it's a strip, just like wallpaper.  That's cool as fuck.  It flexes.  What? 
[00:35:00]  Damn.  What's the material they're using?  The future.  Yeah, it's just like, you know, like an electronic backboard and, you know, just a bunch of LEDs.  Because it's LEDs, and they've gotten to the point now that if they could put it on a film,  like that, you're just laying that shit on them.  And now they make flat screens, so they just take the plastic part of the flat screen away  and use just the screen, and it's wallpaper now.  And that's where, like, phones and computers can get tiny.  If they can figure out a way to make a fold, because the screen is the hard part.  I just read about a foldable phone.  A foldable phone.  Yeah, they have work.  You fold it right up, man.  Use it as toilet paper if you want. 
[00:35:30]  That's it.  It's amazing stuff.  That's your job.  That is fucking amazing.  It's about time, though, to have a whole wall in your house via TV.  That would be insane.  That would be great.  Wrap it around the corners and everything.  Whatever, man.  It's a whole house.  You know what business is going to store?  Blackout curtains and blackout shades, because people are going to need to fucking blackout  their apartments for these giant wall televisions.  I'm not joking.  I'm very serious.  I'm really not kidding.  I was just staring at Jimmy.  He was like, I'm not joking.  He stared at me like he does with a joke bombs, which is fair enough, but I was very serious. 
[00:36:00]  Well, obviously, you're talking about porn.  Yeah, yeah.  No, just to get the effect.  You don't want the whole city knowing you're watching some of those, you know...  Yeah.  That would be an odd thing to do here.  You have your whole bedroom.  Every wall has that monitor on it, you know, a wallpaper.  And then you make your own porno and watch it as you're doing it every wall you look at.  Yes.  Exactly.  We used to do CES.  What's frustrating about it is you go there, you see this cool shit, but now we've got to 
[00:36:30]  wait years for it.  Yeah.  I'd rather not see it.  Right.  Because it's coming out.  It tees you.  How long is it going to take for us to actually have that in our homes and it's affordable?  About 2015, 16.  For real.  Not too far away.  Okay, all right.  Yeah.  All right.  Paper thin.  And I don't know about the affordable part.  You know, anytime that technology enters a market, it's ridiculous.  We'll be able to afford it.  You've got to pay.  You've got to pay back all the technology that it took to make this.  But you know how it goes.  Yeah.  They talked about it.  Remember, we had a physicist on, it might have been Kaku, who said that eventually 
[00:37:00]  the computers and computer chips are going to be as cheap as paper and everything is  going to be wired for the internet.  Like all walls and everything is going to be hardwired.  And that's probably the first step.  It's Kurzweil.  Oh, Ray Kurzweil.  Right, right.  It's Ray Kurzweil.  He's a genius, but he's a fucking bore when it comes to putting a documentary together.  Yeah, a very boring man.  But the shit he knows already that he's envisioning is pretty impressive.  How thick is that paper, the wall, what you just described?  Yeah, it's like about 10 sheets of regular notebook paper. 
[00:37:30]  Come on.  Yeah.  It's a screen.  Just a thick piece of paper.  That's, yeah, that's fucking amazing.  Not as thick as cardboard.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm definitely looking.  I'm waiting for, you know what I want?  You know, you've got to always charge your cell phones.  I'm waiting for like some kind of wire that would, not a wireless charging system, you  know?  Yes.  Why not?  They've got wireless everything else.  That makes sense.  It's been so difficult over the years to try to convey power over the air.  They could do it through microwaves, but it's dangerous and it's so inefficient to take 
[00:38:00]  power from one area and beam it to another area.  Right.  To charge a battery.  Yeah, to charge it.  It just, it's not very efficient.  Don't make better, I've got better batteries first.  Yeah, yeah.  I tell you, I bought, I got the iPhone, but I also have the Galaxy.  Bragger.  I wanted to, I wanted to compare for myself.  People are like, ah, this, that, and I've noticed there's some things about the iPhone  I don't like.  So I got the Galaxy.  That fucker goes dead faster than any other phone I've ever had. 
[00:38:30]  A Galaxy?  Yeah.  And people say, well, you've got to set it for this and then you could get another battery  so you pop it in and do this.  I'm like, yeah, I know there are solutions, but I'm saying, just head to head, that battery  will fucking go dead so quick.  How long will your iPhone last?  It'll last all day and all night.  Probably 24 hours of regular use.  That fucking thing, if I'm not even using it.  If I'm not even using it.  I hate when they have like, you know, those people trying to save their battery and they  put the screen on way dim. 
[00:39:00]  Too damn near.  Don't worry.  It's old enough as it is, so my eyes are going already and I'm like, dude, don't show me  that.  Turn your freaking brightness up.  Brighten that up.  And I'm like, how do you see that?  How about you plug the fucking thing in once in a while?  The worst.  Guilty.  Yeah, you're a dim screen guy.  You got the dim.  Guilty.  Dim screen.  Give me more battery life.  This fucking iPhone.  I get the font like huge so I can see it.  That's what I have.  You save your battery and you're killing your eyes.  Yeah.  This fucking iPhone, I did an upgrade last week and it crashed. 
[00:39:30]  And then when you try to get everything back, you're going to lose like 10 apps or five  apps.  Really?  It's never the same after it fucking crashes.  It's the fucking, I guess really I have nothing to add to that.  No, you're just making everybody sad, Rich.  Your phone was, you know, I mean, how do you follow paper on your wall that's a TV?  It's hard.  I don't know.  Pretty amazing.  I mean, you know, you can easily rip your TV though.  I got this toilet that I put in.  Thank you.  I'm going to change the topic here.  Thank you.  I don't know where you go with that, but it was good.  It's funny you mentioned toilet after that joke. 
[00:40:00]  It wasn't.  Shut up.  It was.  I know it wasn't.  Funny story is I do have a crazy toilet that I just installed in one of these projects  and I had no idea.  But this thing, I mean, it knows if you're male or female.  It walks in.  The lid raises.  Better than Jimmy.  Or the second lid will raise for you so you don't pee all over the seat.  And it plays music through Bluetooth and it's got a warm seat. 
[00:40:30]  It's got the little bidet thing that comes out.  Don't think of those in Japanese hotels that you're talking about.  That's where I've heard of those things from.  They probably do.  That sounds pretty sweet.  But I'll tell you what, now that I'm convinced it's a sex toy.  Oh, yeah?  Because this thing, I mean, it has a remote control.  And it says, you know, rear cleansing.  But it says front cleansing.  I don't think guys are going to be front cleansing.  And then it says pulsating, oscillating, position, and fist.  Fist mode.  That's next year's model. 
[00:41:00]  Fist mode.  Those are amazing, though, right?  Those toilets?  I'm sure there's some women getting off on those things.  The bidet is supposed to be great.  There's a big extra time in there.  Yeah.  And you're an asshole out like that.  Bob Kelly, a friend of ours, has one.  And he said it's the greatest thing ever,  the way it fucking shoots warm water in your ass  and it just cleans you out.  It's a rag.  I don't know if I want to be hosed down  every fucking time to go to the bathroom, right?  Wouldn't it be nice to have the option?  Yeah, why not?  Every once in a while when you know you had a bad one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  Exactly.  You have a massage coming up in the shower.  Fair enough.  What's next?  Emergency.  Ah, I love it.  Vanilla Ice is not here to talk about all that stuff.  Vanilla Ice goes Amish.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What's this about?  This is the first I'm hearing of this.  Yeah, man.  I went out and hung out with the Amish.  Lived with them for a couple months.  The Amish are hot right now.  A lot of shows about the Amish.  Yeah, I was scared, man.  When I went out there, when the sun goes down, it's like every house is haunted.  It's like there's no electricity.  It's pitch black. 
[00:42:00]  If it wasn't for the rental car headlights, I wouldn't know which way to go.  It was scary.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking Amish Mafia.  I'm thinking all this stuff, you know.  But once I met them, man, they're real sweet people.  Yeah.  Real sweet people.  They really pride.  The reason why I did it was because, you know, they pride themselves on construction and building  things and furniture and all that shit.  Sure.  So it was a good thing.  I wanted to go to kind of intern, you know, and see what they did.  Did you wear all the garb?  Oh, had to, man.  You did?  And you only used tools that they use and everything?  Yeah.  I mean, I learned their way of their tools and everything. 
[00:42:30]  But the truth is, is that as long as they're doing it for business, they can use a generator  and power tools.  Oh, okay.  Because they have a high demand.  I mean, they build non-Amish folks' homes.  We've got to put some product out there.  Clarion hotels.  I mean, there's a high demand for the Amish stuff, you know.  Did you look good in that hat?  I don't know, man.  It's probably hard to look good in that.  You look the same as everybody, you know.  Right, right, right.  I just couldn't grow my beard long enough.  No.  No, they got those big.  They got the coolest freaking beards.  Did you do it in Lancaster?  Is that where... 
[00:43:00]  No, you know what?  Misconception is, is that the biggest population is in Pennsylvania.  Guess what?  It's in Ohio.  It's in Ohio.  Berlin, Ohio.  And it's like buggy traffic out there.  150,000.  But what's the big difference between Mennonites and Amish?  Good question.  Thank you.  Every family...  I feel like I'm...  We hate when he asks a good question.  He was a good question.  Not for this radio show, but it was a good question.  Well, we're talking Amish, so we've got to put Mennonites in.  Mennonites are basically the same teaching as Amish, but they get all the luxuries. 
[00:43:30]  They get the cell phone, they get the cars, they get the drive, everything.  So every Amish family has...  They're encouraged by the bishop or whatever, the church, to have more than 10 kids, so that  at least one or two will come back to be an Amish.  And these are all white people.  Yes.  Because they duck out.  They duck out after a while.  Some of the kids are like...  What is it called?  Rum Stella or something?  Rum Springer.  Rum Springer, right.  What is the percentage of kids that leave the family?  75%.  Wow.  So the reason why they have so many is... 
[00:44:00]  And believe it or not, their population doubles every 10 years.  And they're loaded.  They've got tons of money.  They just can't show it because the women wear the same dress, the same shoes.  They all dress alike.  So they buy more land.  They're just buying a bunch of land.  Wow, man.  So they lose seven out of their 10 kids at about...  With hopes that about two come back, yeah.  Wow.  I mean, technology makes it harder, too.  You know what?  They like that because it's a loophole so that they can...  You know, on the Amish farm, they're not allowed electricity.  They don't even have mirrors.  You can't have a mirror in the house.  I cut myself shaven.  I had all these patches all over me. 
[00:44:30]  It was horrible.  Well, they're not going to have to pay taxes on the land, too, because there's farm assessment.  No, they do pay taxes, but they do get the ag exemption, which means it's lower taxes  on their land.  But they pay income tax.  But they have a farm on it.  Yeah.  That's called ag exemption.  Is that why they have beers?  Because they don't have mirrors?  Probably.  They shave them pretty good, though, because they don't have a mustache.  None of them have a mustache.  That's right.  Wait, I've got to ask you one more.  So then seven out of the ten kids leave.  What happens to those kids?  Are they allowed at least to go visit mommy and daddy?  And how does that work? 
[00:45:00]  It works perfect because that's the loophole.  While they're on the Amish farm being Amish, they can get on their buggy and go to their  Mennonite son or daughter's house and watch the World Series.  They can sit there and eat and look in the mirror and do all the luxuries and their kids  can drive them around.  So it works out, you know?  They know what's going on.  That's a hell of a loophole, man.  Yeah.  They were mad about, you know, they were telling me about LeBron James.  I'm like, how do you know that?  You know?  And they're like, we know.  We read the newspaper. 
[00:45:30]  But they also go over to their Mennonite son or whatever's house.  And is that area really close to the Amish usually?  Yeah.  They're all mixed together right in the middle.  So they're not suffering anymore.  They're Americans.  They know everything that's going on, man.  They just keep that heritage alive.  You know, they don't use zippers.  No zippers.  You love that, Norton.  Yeah.  Well, it's easier.  I wore the clothes and there's like this flap.  And I had to go really bad.  So I ran around the outside of the barn there to take a leak.  And it was a funny story because I'm trying to open this flap up, you know?  And God, this thing is hard. 
[00:46:00]  Why don't you just use a zipper, you know?  And I turn around and I see the old world Amish guy smoking a cigarette on his iPhone.  And I'm like, hey, man, what's going on with that?  And he's like, shh, don't say anything.  My wife will kill me.  But they're cool people, man.  They tell great stories.  Yeah.  I lived without my phone and without any, you know, luxuries, no TV, nothing.  I wanted to see how they really do it.  And I had two months.  Wow.  Did you tape a TV show?  Is this our TV show?  A TV show called Vanilla Ice Goes Amish.  That is why I'm here, by the way. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Promoting that, you know.  What network?  DIY Network.  So, Saturday, 10 o'clock.  Do It Yourself.  Wait, who else is on the DIY Network?  Was it Megan?  McCain?  Megan McCain?  I don't know.  No.  I'm trying to remember.  We had someone else.  It's the same as HGTV.  It's just Do It Yourself.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, I've watched a few shows on there.  Yeah.  Like the Vanilla Ice Project.  Four seasons.  Hey.  I like those, you know, handyman kind of shows.  There you go.  That's what it's all about.  You get some great ideas on there. 
[00:47:00]  You still do music?  I still do music, but I've been, you know, it takes eight months a year to do the houses,  you know.  I'm not like the celebrity that just gets placed in there and we build a show.  I mean, I've been doing this 18 years, so it's, I'm a contractor, man.  I get in there in really blood, sweat, and tears.  So, you know, you pretty much know how to do anything in there from the, from the laying  the slab to the roofing.  Absolutely.  And everything in between.  I just cut through a slab.  I'm laying in one right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're filming season four right now, man.  You got to cut through the slab.  Slabo!  Yeah, the, wow.  So, you fucking jack of all trades. 
[00:47:30]  You can frame out a house by yourself.  Oh, not by yourself, but you know how to do all that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Blood, sweat, and tears, man.  Yeah.  I really, really do it.  It's fun.  Was there any, sorry to interrupt you, was there any vibe from Amish girls?  You know, you would think, like, you would see a hot one here or there, but they all  dress the same, same shoes, same everything, and these little glasses, they look like old  grannies, you know.  And it's crazy, because then you'll see some dressed up as teenagers, and they go on that  Rumspringer thing, and they'll pull out, because they're allowed on Rumspringer to go do 
[00:48:00]  whatever they want.  So they automatically go get a cell phone.  Right.  And they'll run around, take pictures and selfies and everything, but they all look  alike.  It's amazing.  You know, you would think they would go in the bathroom, come out, change, like, you  know, somewhere, be hot or something.  It's just, you never see any of that.  Damn.  Did you drop the line on him?  What?  Drop that zero, get with the hero?  Exactly.  He knew exactly where I was going.  I love it. 
[00:48:30]  God damn.  I can't believe you still remember that shit.  Oh, please.  Come on.  That shit was classic.  I love it.  You've got to listen to Ice Ice Baby every fucking time it comes out.  Oh, yeah.  I know you're probably sick of hearing this.  Never.  Never.  That song, it just doesn't get fucking old.  I love it.  Thank you.  Ever.  Fucking great, man.  We ask performers all the time, how sick of one song do you get?  Like, do you get sick of doing that?  Like, we ask musicians, it's going to be hard to do the same song for 20 years, no matter  how good the song is, and sell it the same way to the audience.  You would think I would get tired of it, but it never gets old. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, when you're hearing the crowd go crazy and the energy, you know, you feed off of that.  That's what it's all about.  Wow.  How much has that song made you over the years?  Millions, man.  I mean...  But how many?  Like, millions, millions.  Yes.  One song.  It sold 160 million records, so, I mean, and I bought the publishing back.  We talked about this last year.  Yeah, we did.  So, I can build a catalog.  So, you know, you buy your whole catalog, and one day you do a greatest hits, or, you  know, like the Beatles, every year, or Elvis, every Christmas, you know. 
[00:49:30]  There's a release.  That's just...  Yeah, you're just throwing it back out there, and then hopefully they'll get it.  Or every band that gets into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, that's one of the advantages  to them going and taking it, is they're going to put out a greatest hits record, and they're  going to make a shitload off it, because they're on everybody's radar.  That's it, man.  Catalog.  Catalog sales.  One song worth millions upon millions.  That's it, brother?  Did you do a barn raising?  I did.  Did you do the classic barn raising?  Yes.  Amazing adventure, man.  Yeah.  In two days, we built this gigantic barn.  All these ladies make the food that's like a big picnic, you know, a big spread. 
[00:50:00]  And all the guys are smelling these Dutch apple pies, you know,  and they're like...  But it's like a big event for these people.  It's like a circus or something, because they come in there, and all the kids and teenagers  are meeting people and everything, and it's like 150 of them.  And the barn goes up from dirt in two days.  It is amazing.  And without a lot of the modern equipment, huh?  Yep.  Yeah.  Well, we use some modern equipment, and they use their Morton tendon thing where they have 
[00:50:30]  a groove, and they stick the board through there, and it's got a peg.  But they go extremely fast, and everybody knows what they're doing, and they're getting  to the finish line, which is the picnic, the food.  Right, right.  It's a great blast afterwards, huh?  Yeah.  They're excited.  I could see, though, you with the hat on and stuff kind of looking the part.  Yeah.  Like, you could do that, you know.  Shit, yeah, man.  Get in where you fit in.  Enjoy the experience.  Do you ever...  I'm going to definitely check that out.  Now, you stayed there.  You didn't take off for a weekend and go to Philly, and...  What I did is I had...  I would take the Amish buggy, all right, to and from. 
[00:51:00]  I even took it through the drive-thru.  They have Amish buggy parking at Walmart.  They have a Walmart there.  It's huge.  And so I found, like, one hill with service, and I would just park the buggy on top of that  hill and have my guys go back, because they don't have electricity, so I couldn't charge  it in the Amish house.  I told my guys, you know, the camera crew, take this and charge it and bring it back.  Yeah.  I'll have a good pass card.  But I was working so hard shoveling pig shit and manure.  Wow.  I mean, I had to really get their approval, because they were like, you know... 
[00:51:30]  They didn't say much to me the first week.  I thought everybody was introverted, you know?  And then they loosened up, and they started telling great jokes, and I'm like, what do  you do for entertainment, man?  It's got to be bored without any, you know, thing.  And they sit on the front porch and tell great jokes, and they play the guitar, and campfires,  and they're country people, man.  Are they allowed to imbibe any alcohol or anything like that?  Some do.  Yeah?  Yeah, some do.  I don't think they're allowed to go, like, excessive.  Right, get all crazy and hammered on the Amish.  The neighbors have to tell on them, otherwise the neighbors get in trouble. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So everybody tells on everybody.  Holy shit.  Wait, they rat on each other?  Yeah, yeah, they rat each other out big time.  Do they have elders?  They have to.  Do you get sent to elders if you do something bad?  They'll shun you.  They'll shun you, right.  The bishop can show up at your house and walk in uninvited and say, hey, I see a little  electric cord over there or, you know, a cell phone or anything.  I mean, a mirror.  You're done.  Shunned.  What does that mean?  Like, you have to leave.  You have to leave the church indefinite.  You can't come back.  You guys do a banjo version of Ice Ice Baby? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, my God.  It's funny you said that, bro.  I'm hearing.  I'm hearing.  That's the first time today.  These guys, like, we have to have approval from the bishop to even go on camera, right?  Sure.  And we put GoPros.  The Amish have no idea that that is a camera, you know, this little GoPro.  And we just stuck them all over the buggy.  And I was cruising down the road.  You know, you don't have a radio you can turn on.  You have to talk or do something.  And the cameras are there.  And this Amish guy just loosens up.  And I swear to God, man, this guy yodeled Ice Ice Baby. 
[00:53:00]  He yodeled up.  And he's like, oh, if they would have only filmed that.  And I'm like, you don't even have a clue.  We got it.  Those little things are cameras.  He goes, those right there are cameras?  I'm like, yeah.  Because he thought the big thing was cameras.  The magic little cameras.  Those things are great.  Bro, yodeled it.  I can't wait to hear that.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  It's on there.  It's on there.  Oh, man.  Just when I thought I heard every mix, dubstep, house, whatever, they got freaking yodel now.  Amish version.  The Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[00:53:30]  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Yes, indeed.  It's Sam Roberts here with the Worst of the Week Countdown on the Opie and Anthony Channel  where we highlight all the wonderful things that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're going to get to Opie and what he has to pay in emotional or physical costs now that E-Rock is back from vacation. 
[00:54:00]  If you remember, he gave out E-Rock's cell phone number last week.  Michelle Beadle and Russell Peters in studio.  Rich Voss in studio.  Pete Holmes, who's going to be taking over the slot after Conan O'Brien, was in studio.  All that's still to come, but it's Jocktober, so why not celebrate?  Every day, every day, throughout the month of October, we're listening to another bad radio show  and making fun of it for no apparent reason.  This week on the Countdown, we listened to Jeff and Jen from Cincinnati. 
[00:54:30]  Jeff and Jen, this one went so bad for them that they had to make a statement on their Facebook page when we were done.  And when I say we, I mean you.  Those who, for whatever reason, decided to attack their Facebook page.  It's Jocktober and Jeff and Jen here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number five.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions. 
[00:55:00]  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  What is he?  Host, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  People are very angry at pontificating proportions.  Why?  It doesn't make sense.  So, uh, Mike, stunt brain, said something. 
[00:55:30]  And then another listener tweeted something and said, pontificating, there isn't such thing  as pontificating proportions.  Wait a minute.  Did it say pontificating, oh yeah, proportions of something?  Of pontificating proportions.  Oh yeah, that's stupid.  That doesn't make sense.  Who put that together and thought pontificating meant, like, big or monumental or all?  It doesn't sound cool, though.  Well, it does, but you could have come up with another word for big that kind of sounds like 
[00:56:00]  pontificating.  Oh boy, we're going to Cincinnati today.  Cincinnati, Ohio.  We're going to say hi to...  WKRP.  Oh no.  Oh, X.  We're going to Q102 in Cincinnati.  Cincinnati, Jeff and Jenny.  Oh no.  I don't know if you need to say it with such an attitude.  Jeff and Jenny.  Jeff and Jenny.  Are our focus today.  Hey, he's doing a show with two broads. 
[00:56:30]  With Jeff and Jen.  Oh.  Oh, who's the other broad?  Oh, I saw the exclamation point.  I thought that was an I.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, it's Jeff and Jen.  Jeff and Jen.  Oh, it's the ampersand.  With some other chick.  With some other...  Oh man, this guy's sandwiched between two holes on the show?  Oh yeah.  Jesus.  What's better than one hole?  Ah, two.  Oh no.  Hey, can we do hole day?  I was thinking about that.  Oh, that's a good thing.  But I was thinking about it at the gym.  Just one day where it's just holes. 
[00:57:00]  Just feature various holes from around the country.  Oh, yes.  That is a good one.  That would be lovely.  Maybe the listeners can help you out and...  Yeah, we could.  I just monitor different shows every day.  I mean, we don't...  But maybe the listeners, it's not Sam on Twitter.  They find a quick clip of a hole in their market and they can send it in.  Oh yeah, yeah.  And maybe we can put a day of holes together.  Oh, easily.  Can we try that?  Sure, yeah.  Because we are trying to mix it up a little bit this Jocktober.  Yeah.  Do you think they ruined the shows?  Oh my gosh.  But you guys don't know if...  Oh my gosh.  Jen and the other chick are holes.  That's true. 
[00:57:30]  Oh my God.  It's a guarantee.  Why do you say that?  Because...  Is it because he's sandwiched between them with his arms folded?  Yes.  Yeah, like, I'm trying to get away with stuff, but I can't with these two around me.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh.  And they're sitting there going, we're here to have fun, but not too much fun.  Well, you know.  No, it's fun like us ladies like to have fun.  Right, girls?  Yeah.  Give me some basic facts before you start playing the clips. 
[00:58:00]  Well...  Jeff and Jen, Q102 in Cincinnati.  Yeah, they do the morning show over there on Q102.  Sure.  Okay.  They play the hits.  Okay.  What kind of hits, though?  Hits without the rap?  Or all the hits?  They don't even have...  I mean, today's Twerk Tuesday.  Today's Twerk Tuesday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  And what does that do?  What are they...  They're not twerking.  Oh, that's fun, though.  Oh, boy.  Today's Twerk Tuesday.  Oh, they show Miley. 
[00:58:30]  Well, yeah, Twerk Tuesday.  What happens on Twerk Tuesday?  They just say that?  You can win a download code for the new Miley Cyrus album every hour today.  But what is the Twerk Tuesday part?  I guess Miley Cyrus twerks, and it's an alliteration.  So they just came up with something, but there's nothing behind it?  No.  It just sounds cool to say it's Twerk Tuesday on Q102.  Yes.  Here in Cincinnati?  Yes.  Oh.  What else they got?  The Bosom Ball is coming out. 
[00:59:00]  What is the Bosom Ball?  I really don't want to say what woman is singing.  I'm assuming it's to fight breast cancer.  Ah.  Yeah.  That's a good cause.  We could all agree with that.  Yeah, of course.  What was the show?  Was it last year where that broad put together all the women in a hotel?  Does anyone else remember that?  That was one of my favorite Jocktobers ever.  They had the women convention.  Oh, my God.  The Jeff and Jen Alarm Clock app.  Yes.  What is the Alarm Clock app? 
[00:59:30]  What does that do?  Well, you can wake up and get instant access to your favorite morning show, weather, and  more.  Wow.  Pretty handy.  They have a fucking app.  Oh, yeah.  What else?  Basic knowledge.  I mean, that's it.  They're an adult, I would say, oriented.  A lot of soccer moms listening.  Any bios?  Sure.  Yeah, we love the bios.  I like a good bio.  We love the radio.  And this is where I just show bio.  Keep referring to not Jen as the girl who's not Jen because she's not in the bio. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy.  Jeff and Jen have been waking up Cincinnati since 2002.  All right.  11 years.  You'd think that between the two of them, plus Fritch.  Is that Fritch?  Fritch.  Is that her name?  Fritch?  I guess.  She's as big as a fridge.  She likes going to the fridge.  She is a fatty.  Oh, God.  Sometimes we decide not to be subtle. 
[01:00:30]  I know.  Fuck it.  Some days it's all lit.  Fuck it.  You'd think there would be...  Phase one initiated, by the way.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Yeah, everyone's on test now.  Yeah.  I've heard they have meetings now about Jacktober.  Yeah.  Whew.  Now, I'm not saying we're going to be featured.  Just in case.  We've got to be on this.  We need a contingency plan.  That's right.  I got emailed a copy of an email that radio people are being sent.  Ah.  To be on the lookout for Jacktober.  Yeah, I know.  Bolo.  What did it say? 
[01:01:00]  It just said it didn't give the Opie and Anthony show credit.  It acted like there were a group of, like, cyber hackers.  Terrorists.  Terrorists.  Radio terrorists.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, look out.  Yeah.  But they say, you know, they've been waking up to Cincinnati since 2002.  You'd think between the two of them, plus Fritch, that there would be quite a few cups of coffee in the studio.  You're just fucking a Fritch.  Oh, Fritch.  Fritch.  Oh, Fritch.  Suck my dick, Fritch. 
[01:01:30]  Fritch.  It's like you're fucking asking one of your college frat buddies.  Yeah.  That's a frat buddy nickname.  Yeah.  Oh, me and Fritch when Al Isaac got fucking hammered.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, Fritch took a shit in the glove compartment.  Fritch.  I'm going to come, Fritchie.  Fritchie, yeah.  A little info on each of them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But when they're not with Q, that's the name of the station, Fritch loves taking in everything Cincinnati has to offer. 
[01:02:00]  Everything every restaurant has to offer.  From going to Bengals and Reds games to enjoying summer concerts at Riverbend, she especially loves her Skyline.  Extra hot sauce, please.  All right.  A little local reference.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They just described a regular person.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Who doesn't go to sporting events and concerts in their city?  Well, that's why you listen to her, because she's a regular gal.  Oh, we'll wait till you find out.  Jen.  Yeah.  You'll find Jen most often hanging out with her awesome son, Jacob, or working on her many hidden talents, which include tap dancing, belting out show tunes. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, she's Gregory Hines.  Oh, boy.  Fitting her whole fist in her mouth.  All right.  All right.  How about mine?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:03:00]  And knowing the number of every value meal at McDonald's, Arby's, and Wendy's.  It's all about eating and fucking...  So she's proud of her chub.  What'd you hear about Jeff?  A self-professed foodie.  Roll on!  Jeff's favorite place in Cincinnati is the chef's table at Boca.  Oh.  Besides his love for food, he also possesses an uncanny sense of direction. 
[01:03:30]  What?  Wow.  You can drop me anywhere in the country blindfolded, he says.  And I'll find...  It was just going to be another rest area, too.  I saved us all the trouble.  He says, I'll always find my way back.  Sounds like a challenge.  It does.  That's not me.  Yeah.  That was my bio.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, that tells us a lot about the...  Jeff and Jen. 
[01:04:00]  And Frits.  That's it.  And Frits.  Yeah.  I guess her name's Frits.  Well, why don't we dive right in and hear a little bit of...  The Jeff and Jen show on Q102 in Cincinnati.  We start with time to play fake or for real.  Fake or for real.  Fake or for real, everybody.  We're going to play a game.  Hey, job or no job.  Did he find his facts?  I don't know for sure if he did or not.  He's still looking for a gig, though.  I see that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He needs a gig.  Poor Scorch.  Just how this one's played. 
[01:04:30]  What do you mean?  Like, can you guess, based on the insanely original title, fake or for real, how the game is played?  All right.  Is this story fake or for real?  All right.  You got it.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  What do they do with limbs?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  And Cincinnati's Q102.  Let's play it around, a fake or for real.  Oh, Jesus.  With that...  This is torture.  Like, radio could be the easiest gig in the world.  Why make it shitty? 
[01:05:00]  It's got all the features, too.  With the bad background music.  Everything needs a bed.  Everything needs a wacky, goofy kind of bed.  Everything needs a bed.  Everything needs a name.  Yeah.  A name.  And we're going to phrase it like everybody knows what it is.  It's a round of fake or for real.  It is fake or for real.  You know.  You played it before with us.  You know the music.  You got to make believe it's fun, even though you know it's shitty.  It sucks.  Just getting it to the next Miley Cyrus song.  It's fun, Twerking Tuesday.  And Cincinnati's Q102.  Let's play it around, a fake or for real. 
[01:05:30]  Three headlines here.  Tell us which one is real, and we're going to send you to the Children's Theater performance  of Andy Jr.  It's not for you, Uncle Paul.  I like the Children's Theater.  Yeah?  All the adults have face masks on.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  I like when they perform all Calcutta.  Yeah.  Or the original Broadway production of Hair.  Yeah, we do.  Of Hairless.  Hairless. 
[01:06:00]  Hairless.  Oh, this stinks.  This is terrible.  To the Children's Theater performance of Andy Jr. at the Tap Theater.  Here we have tickets to Andy Jr.  She loves tap.  How much can the tickets cost?  Seven bucks?  You're winning tickets to the Children's Theater production of Andy Jr.  What is Andy Jr.?  They all play like, it's like Archie Kids?  Yeah, Archie Kids.  Flintstone Kids.  It's like, um, it's a tap thing, I think she said. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Well, she's into tap dancing.  She loves the tap dancing.  I like times that might fly and say, gift Daddy Warbucks a gift.  It's not even a little subtle anymore.  We decide not to be subtle.  It's a hot cock life, Mike.  Yeah, the sun will come out tomorrow, but for now it's the daughter.  Get over here.  Let me make love to your mouth.  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[01:07:00]  It's just wrong.  All right.  All right.  Let's continue.  All right.  Here we go.  Is it A?  A groom forgets to book his wedding venue, so he calls in a bomb threat on the wedding  day to get the place shut down.  Oh, I don't like that.  Is it B?  See, a woman leaves a purse filled with cocaine at a footlocker and is arrested when she comes  back to get it.  No.  Wow.  Or see, a man escapes from prison and goes straight to another prison that's closer to  his family.  All right.  $20 gets a guess. 
[01:07:30]  I'm going to say...  It's definitely not the last one, because that's too clever.  Right, that's too obvious.  That's a real story.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with the, um...  What's the first one?  The cocaine in the footlocker, or what was the first one?  Wait, do we have to find out the answer?  Yeah.  Um, unfortunately, they received no calls, so that was the end of a real affair.  They never gave the real answer.  They've been doing radio for 12 years.  Oh, my God.  In that city. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, during spots, they're like, man, blow it off, blow it off.  We didn't get any calls.  Yeah, that was the end of a real...  You're kidding, right?  Did they say that they didn't get calls, or they just moved on, so they made believe  that didn't happen?  They just pretended that that was in my imagination.  Oh, that's...  Wow.  Oh, brilliant.  They said, we'll give it to the 20th caller.  Oh.  Oh, they came back and said?  No, they said it in that clip.  They go, 20th caller, we'll get the chance to win.  Wow.  Oh.  20 callers.  They didn't get one.  Oh, God.  That's...  That's...  That's a lofty goal. 
[01:08:30]  All right, so that...  ...giving phone calls.  That went nowhere for them.  Very good.  So, yeah, I'm sorry, I should have interrupted you earlier, but there's no reason for you  guys to try to figure that out.  All right.  We will not be getting the answer.  Good.  Okay.  Well, we're going to move on, then, with Jeff and Jen, CQ102 in Cincinnati.  Why is there a picture of a woman, and she's topless, she's holding her tits, and on her  chest it says aborted.  On her right tits, it says Hitler, and on her left tits, it says cock.  Aborted Hitler, cock. 
[01:09:00]  That's so nice.  Seems to be...  A little harsh.  Up there.  Well, I don't know why there are photos of Jim Chandler circling on his Facebook page.  That's weird.  The hidden picture doesn't look well, either.  Oh.  Is that duty falling out of a hiney?  Who posted that?  Oh.  Daniel Curlin.  That's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no.  All right, you know, she's...  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, my God.  They got a horrendous Facebook page.  Wow.  Facebook allows this?  Oh, there's a black...  A naked black guy fucking a bucket of KFC.  Why are the pictures always different?  Oh.  You never see a double.  No.  Always finding great shit.  Amazing.  And one of my favorite things the whole time, hey, I did this for you.  Yes, there's...  The Hulk Hogan again.  Ticking down the towers.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  Oh, gosh.  That's terrible. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, God.  This is...  Oh.  Oh, geez.  Oh, look.  It's young Sam Roberts.  Yeah, there's me.  It was Iraq.  Iraq is...  Is he here today?  Oh.  Iraq.  You're here today?  You see the Facebook?  Iraq.  Oh, that's not nice.  Iraq?  All right.  We'll wait.  Oh.  Some idiot thinks I have something to do with that.  I don't.  You fucking cunt.  Whoa.  To do with what?  That's why we're not talking about it.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh.  Stupid fucking douche. 
[01:10:30]  When Iraq wants to talk about it, he'll talk about us.  Iraq.  Damn.  I supposedly had a meeting and made sure that, yeah, we didn't talk about us.  Did you?  Oh.  Why'd you...  Why'd that happen?  I was probably...  Just fucking dicks.  Photo of intern David with a mustache and a wizard hat on.  A wizard hat.  All right.  Well, it seems like they're Facebook fans.  It's another Iraq phone number picture.  I love the Iraq phone number photo. 
[01:11:00]  Now I do, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, what's next since that failed miserably?  Well, their little game failed.  Yeah.  Even they said, you know how to play, so they have played this game before.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  I think their prize was shitty.  What was the prize again?  The fucking kids theater tap dancing fucking Annie Jr.  True.  Yeah.  It sucked.  Great prize.  Jeff's got an unbelievable, interesting story about Starbucks. 
[01:11:30]  The Paul Williams army.  It says Paul Williams army, nigga, and it's a picture of Paul Williams.  All right.  Well, our fan base has to turn into the Paul Williams army.  Oh, yeah.  We love Paul Williams.  We love Paul Williams.  We're going to get some piano lessons for Christmas.  That's hilarious.  Jeff's got an unbelievably interesting story about Starbucks.  Oh.  Want to hear it?  Yeah.  And there are a ton of people out there who consider the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte  one of the best parts of fall. 
[01:12:00]  So let's hope this doesn't ruin it for you.  Oh, it's good.  But you should know.  There's no.  There's the whole.  Oh, that whole voice.  Oh, it is good.  Oh, it's so good.  Dennis Fuhrer.  Dennis Falcone.  Yeah, there's a Dennis Fuhrer.  A photo.  I don't know, but.  Of Hitler with his hand up, giving the salute with a swastika, of course, emblazoned on  his arm.  However, Denny has photoshopped his head.  Yes.  Over the Hitler face.  Big smile. 
[01:12:30]  And it says Dennis Fuhrer.  Dennis Fuhrer.  That's funny.  All right.  Oh, actual pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  It tastes like it.  Oh, my God.  Once again, we need your help.  We want to do a whole day where we just feature the whole.  So we need you guys to monitor some fucking local radio and send in some clips.  All right.  Send it to NotSam on Twitter, please.  And this woman misunderstood because she likes a bumpkin.  A bumpkin. 
[01:13:00]  I'm sorry.  A bumpkin.  I meant to say bumpkin.  A bumpkin.  Oh, I am a bumpkin.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Oh, boo.  A bumpkin.  Boo.  Good.  You should know there's no actual pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  It tastes like it.  The flavor actually comes from cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and.  And a pumpkin pie-flavored syrup.  Syrup, yeah.  Yeah, it's all the shit that makes pumpkin taste good. 
[01:13:30]  Pumpkin sucks unless you spice it up.  What?  There's a warning of a Denny-nado on there.  A Denny-nado.  I love it.  There's a tornado with Denny's face on it.  I love that Dennis Falcone has become the face of Jack Tover.  He's the man.  Oh, yeah.  Pie-flavored syrup.  Syrup, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which is actually made of chemicals and spices, but no real pumpkin.  Isn't it amazing how they can simulate it, though?  Almost exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin? 
[01:14:00]  What was the hole for?  Wait, what did she say that for?  I don't know.  That's just a noise she makes.  Yes.  It's the noise of the hole.  Like, who cares if there's not real pumpkin crammed into this drink at Starbucks?  Or drive a pre-team.  Dennis Falcone's hard drive of pre-teams.  With a goofy smile.  Oh, that's a good one.  We got some funny listeners, man. 
[01:14:30]  There's a picture of a hard drive, and the word pre-teams is written in, like, cum.  Oh, God.  The cum font.  Opie, you're exactly right, though.  Pumpkin.  If you just took a spoonful of pumpkin out of a pumpkin and ate it, it wouldn't taste like pumpkin pie.  The reason it tastes like pumpkin pie is all the shit they put in it, and that's the shit they're putting in the fucking dumb coffee to make it taste like that.  So why is this a story?  Why is it even a story?  No one takes a pumpkin and cut it up and eats slices.  Because it's shitty.  Why did she do that? 
[01:15:00]  Can we hear that again?  You can simulate it, though?  Almost exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin?  That's a letdown, though.  It's not.  Why is this so stupid?  The angle is, wait a minute, has anyone actually ever tasted pumpkin?  Right.  Because the answer would be no.  Yeah, put some pumpkin in your coffee and tell me how much better it is, you dummy.  No one sits around and eats pumpkin.  Some asshole figured out if you put a bunch of spices together, it could be tasty.  A dog fucking girl.  What kind of fucking radio station is this? 
[01:15:30]  It's just terrible.  This is another photo of Denny.  The caption says, I don't always do shitty radio, but when I do, actually I always do shitty radio.  Why would she be let down?  Because it wasn't...  Who gives a fuck here?  Oh!  That's a letdown!  But the point would be that that means she tried...  She likes pumpkin, but no one likes pumpkin.  No.  Of course not.  We invented pumpkin flavor.  Yes.  But it's all that spice shit. 
[01:16:00]  Oh!  Oh, no.  That's exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin.  That's a letdown, though.  I don't think you're drinking it for the health factor.  No.  You're not.  I'm sure it doesn't matter.  Any more than people...  What happened?  What happened?  I can't even say it.  It's so offensive, I can't even say it.  Wait, you're tongue-tied on something offensive?  I can't even say it.

[01:20:30]  The Worst of the Week countdown continues.  Rolling right along.  It's the Worst of the Week countdown.  Getting near the top.  I'm Sam Roberts, and I am the top.  Well, I'm a top.  Well, I'm...  Oh, boy.  This is starting to sound bad.  We're highlighting the very best that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  There's still to come, Michelle Beatles, Russell Peters, Pete Holmes.  E-Rock is back from vacation after his cell phone number was given out on the air.  We'll hear from him.  Before we get to any of it, Rich Voss was in studio.  Now, Rich, comedian, recovering addict, gambling was a problem for him for quite some time. 
[01:21:00]  So, when he took his jacket off after getting in studio,  and we found a lottery ticket on the inside pocket, we had some questions.  Colin Quinn called in.  It was real.  It was honest.  It was educational.  And it was hilarious.  Here it is.  Rich Voss on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I miss Voss. 
[01:21:30]  He liked.  Yeah, he hasn't been on in a while.  No, I'm just doing a segment called Things No One's Ever Said.  Okay, can I play?  I love his hat.  Oh, where is it?  Oh, his hat is not, it's to prevent the stupidity leaks.  I love that.  It's like one of those hats they wear on that Newsies show.  You never see Newsies?  No, but it's a Newsies hat.  Yeah, Newsies hat.  Get your papers.  Although with him, it would be Snoozies.  Joozies. 
[01:22:00]  Joozies.  Joozies.  Joozies.  Extra, extra.  Extra.  Teeth in my mouth.  Extra.  We're mocking your hat.  We don't like your hat.  We've been wearing that hat forever.  Or some form of it.  We don't like it.  Huh?  We don't like your hat.  Huh?  Do you like my Breaking Bad jacket?  I forgot the hot part.  Is that, I don't know, I don't know.  He's got a Heisenberg jacket.  It's a Heisenberg jacket.  Why do you have a Breaking Bad jacket?  Hello?  Why do you have a horrible Gap shirt? 
[01:22:30]  It's a coat.  You fucking idiot.  Why do I have it?  To keep me warm.  I don't know.  That was just stupid.  Why do you wear underwear?  To stop pissing going on your pants?  So we're going to do this today?  All right.  No, no, no.  We'll have fun.  Trust me.  I have no problem doing this.  Let's go.  No, I'm not doing anything.  You have a stupid Breaking Bad jacket on.  Why do you have it?  Because a company sent it to me for free.  All right.  There's the answer.  But it's not a dumb...  You're making...  Like, why do I have...  It's kind of a dumb jacket.  It looks stupid.  But...  Okay, let's take a vote.  But you're proud that you got it, I guess.  I was going to say, it's not that the jacket's dumb.  It's just what's between that and the jacket that's dumb. 
[01:23:00]  That's what you want to say as you clean up your coffee.  Yes, I made a mistake and I'm fixing it.  So did your parents when they dropped that load in each other.  Oh, fuck each other.  I understood what you meant when you said my parents.  You didn't have to explain how it happened.  What's with the lining?  Yeah, why do you have that?  I'm not a tailor.  Oh, it looks like a blue...  Why do they give that to you?  It's a blue...  The meth.  The meth.  Yeah, the meth.  It's a good jacket for a guy in recovery to wear.  And it's...  But why do you have it? 
[01:23:30]  20...  208 to 23rd to Heisenberg, limited edition...  What are you doing with this lotto thing?  Gambler?  Competitive...  What are you doing with that?  Uh-oh.  I'm trying to leave my wife.  Good luck here.  Oh, no.  We're gambling again.  He's got a pitch.  That's kind of gambling.  Yeah, really?  I had a couple drinks once in a while.  I smoked a couple cigarettes.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, man.  You got caught by taking your jacket off.  Oh, you are.  What are you doing?  That's how Greg got caught with those cigarettes.  Right.  That's right.  In the Brady Bunch episode.  And it turns out that they weren't his cigarettes. 
[01:24:00]  But I think that's your bet slip right there.  No, it's not.  It's for my wife.  You can't bet for your wife.  You're playing the numbers.  You're playing.  Do you know I know a comic?  That leads to craps eventually.  Oh, man.  And that was your downfall.  I was in what casino over the weekend?  Oh, Revel last week.  And I didn't play craps longer than an hour.  No, I don't.  Roll them bones.  When I was at MGM Graham for a week, I didn't play at all. 
[01:24:30]  But that means you've been playing somewhere.  What are you doing?  Because you're telling us the times you didn't play.  Yeah.  I'm reading between the lines here.  Are you dabbling a little bit?  No.  Yes, yes.  I haven't bet on sports.  Jimmy knows.  It doesn't matter.  I haven't drank whiskey.  I haven't drank wine.  It's not like food or sex.  You can be abstinent from gambling.  You were doing great.  What are you doing?  You're dabbling a little bit.  And I'm still doing great.  But you know that.  I don't bet on sports.  You're up or down?  I know the difference.  I know.  Oh, my God.  You're dabbling.  What are you doing?  Don't do this.  For real.  You're justifying it. 
[01:25:00]  You're up.  Huh?  Look how wide awake I am.  I'm great.  No, I mean.  Oh, in gambling?  You're betting, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How long have you been doing it?  This is a real moment.  Jimmy's not happy.  No, I'm worried about it.  I don't want to see much of that shit.  Of course.  Gambling was your downfall.  You lost everything.  Boss is doing really good with that.  Right?  I don't bet on sports.  I don't gamble.  I really.  How long have you been dabbling?  You're dabbling?  Yeah, don't just.  How long?  Come on.  You know the difference.  I don't know.  A couple months or a year or two.  Really?  No.  Just a little bit of this.  A couple years or two.  All right.  No. 
[01:25:30]  I don't gamble in casinos.  Like, here's.  Let me give you an example.  All right.  I know I'm wrong.  I know the difference between.  You're just fine.  I know.  I know I'm just fine.  All right.  But I'll give you an example.  Jimmy knows this game.  You're not going to get this test.  I'm kidding.  I'm not kidding myself.  I know the deal.  Are you dabbling in how much?  I was at the MGM for a week.  Right.  Monday night I was there.  Right.  I played craps.  I won 400 bucks.  And I quit for the week.  And I used that for my golf money.  Wow.  So I.  You know what I mean?  So I know I'm playing on the tracks. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  I haven't been on sports in eight years at all.  That's why I don't even watch it.  I don't care.  Because if you don't have money on it, why watch it?  That's what Jimmy's saying.  Like whiskey, wine, beer.  No, I know.  I'm not kidding.  I know the more addiction thing.  I know I'm wrong.  And I know either I stop or I end up being a fucking mess.  But you're dabbling.  And just listening to you explain it and talk about it, you're saying it in a way that I say things when I'm  protecting them. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Like, yeah, man.  Like, I know how.  It's not like you're lying, but you're saying things.  But I'm only like, and I, you think, you don't think I've convinced myself that I'm fucking,  the reason I get hookers is because it's so much cheaper than knocking somebody up.  Which is, I mean, technically I'm right.  I know that.  I know that.  I just believe it.  I probably saved money over the long run instead of impregnating two or three people.  However, I know I'm justifying it.  But I want to give you a compliment.  But the fact that you lost weight, you now have a chin. 
[01:27:00]  Thank you.  That you lost all the other crap around you.  Thank you.  That you have a profile now.  Yes, I do.  And I like that.  Although my most recent photo, I've been obsessing how my neck doesn't look good.  What?  Is this your neck?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Were they feeding you worms in your picture?  No.  Jesus.  I was in a picture that I took recently.  No, I liked it.  All right.  I'm just like.  I just.  Someone throwing bread at you? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, it was you because you thought I was a casino.  Get it.  Throwing bread.  That's a 70s comeback.  Yes, of course.  See, look at my neck in this picture, man.  It's weird.  It's like, it's just because I'm at a really weird angle.  There's not.  No.  Someone should fix it with a knife.  You're standing next to the undead.  You look fucking beautiful.  My neck looks weird.  He wanted to show me I had a picture with Paul McCartney.  Everyone knows.  Oh, of course.  Actually, my neck is.  I look retarded. 
[01:28:00]  You had Paul McCartney in studio?  No, we're not a show.  Way to rub it in, boy.  Way to rub it in.  We couldn't possibly.  We didn't get him.  Then how the fuck did you get a picture with him?  He was outside.  He's Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  He was walking around the joint.  If he's within a fucking blast radius of a hydrogen bomb of this building, he'll get  a picture.  He knew who you were?  Yeah, the guy getting a picture with him.  Exactly.  I liked it.  That was funny.  I haven't been here in months.  It's kind of refreshing.  Since you started dabbling.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Since I've been here.  He knew he'd have to confess.  Rich knew that if he comes here, it's going to come out, because he's too honest to not 
[01:28:30]  say it.  I am a quite honest person.  Yeah, you are.  He says, I don't, I'm too honest.  How's she feeling about you dabbling?  This is a real thing, Richard.  No, I don't, I don't gamble, uh, like, I, is he gambling?  No, it's just a social thing now.  I was an addict.  You are an addict.  Addict.  Addict.  Yes.  Addict.  Addict.  Addict.  You know, you weren't at the top of the house.  You weren't at the fucking button.  You're an addict.  Addict.  Hold on.  You're not your dad.  We missed him. 
[01:29:00]  Hold on.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Oh.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Colin.  How's Colin?  Were you at the Paper Mill Playhouse tonight?  Huh?  Were you stretching and doing your fucking one-man show that's superb?  That's so good.  How is that a slam?  By the way, Vos didn't, wasn't sure until the last moment if he was going to say that's  terrible.  Right, right, right.  He's doing it superb to try to take the high road.  He decided to take the high road.  Because here's...  Yeah, I don't like... 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Vos, it's really...  I appreciate anyone who wants to make that positive turnaround.  It's really like eight years too late for you to even start trying.  Just on an age level, I'm saying.  Don't fall.  Not a career level, but age-wise.  Forget it.  Yeah.  What are you doing now?  Pounding the pavement this early?  What are you doing?  I was calling because, actually, I was so infuriated because I saw one of Norton's tweets,  you know, sometimes I'll read Norton's tweets because I have a full, vigorous life.  And so I'll back up and read all those tweets. 
[01:30:00]  Which tweet bothered you?  Norton talking.  I don't even know if I can get it out.  He goes, met Paul McCartney.  Paul McCartney, for those that don't know, is one of the original fucking Beatles.  Yes.  It says, couldn't have been nicer.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, a fucking soccer mom commented.  First of all, just the idea that Norton somehow in his head thinks, hey guys, I'm signing off on Paul McCartney. 
[01:30:30]  He doesn't know.  No, here's what happened.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm not done with the tweet.  All right.  New, which I guess is some awful Paul McCartney album that's dropping on the 15th, drops October 15th.  Yes.  And the other thing Paul McCartney, who's part of a massive fucking machine, doesn't need is your goddamn promo for him.  Yes, but I...  It's about you thinking, hey, it was quid pro quo.  And then I fucking promoted his album. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, shit.  Hold on a second now.  Are you biting your knuckle?  No, I understand.  Now, Collins is not impressed with the Beatles.  I mean, they were a generation after him.  No, but here's the problem.  Here's why I got...  Here's why I did that.  I said he was a nice guy because he actually stopped...  Well, you said he couldn't have been nice.  Yeah, I did say it like that, but there's only X amount of characters you can work in, and I was hoping for a retweet.  Oh, gosh.  I figured if I plugged the record, maybe they would retweet. 
[01:31:30]  And Paul McCartney was saying how great Grown Ups 2 was and how your scene where you were doing the Dairy Queen, that scene where the Dairy Queen came out of your ass, how clever it was.  You stink.  You're the fucking worst.  You'll take anything.  You're scrambling.  You're calling up to go after my pal's tweets.  Shut up.  That's right.  Shut up and just have fun in Bridgeport tonight, okay?  Is that why the Grown Ups 2 wrap party...  You came, panicked, over to my table because you had nobody you knew there. 
[01:32:00]  And your table was just me.  Jesus.  I was scrambling over so happy.  I never seen you so wide-eyed in my life as you walking downstairs.  You know what?  McCartney couldn't...  You're out of here, all of you can show me.  Just admit it.  McCartney couldn't have been nicer, but Colin Quinn could have been.  Oh, man.  Colin Quinn could have been...  It's like that scene in Mr. Saturday Night.  You could have been nicer. 
[01:32:30]  If Paul McCartney invited you to go somewhere, Jimmy, wouldn't he have been nicer?  I meant in the context...  So you said he couldn't have been nicer, but he could have been.  Not in the context of our interaction.  Now, McCartney would jerk me off.  Well, yeah, but you only have a certain amount of fucking...  Of characters, so you're trying to say something nice, you're trying to tweet something that's  pleasant so you don't get yelled at by the company for fucking running in and jumping  in a photo that you probably shouldn't have been taking, and you're hoping for a retweet 
[01:33:00]  like a whore, but you know you can't say, please retweet.  So you do that, and you know, that's what you do.  Yeah.  It was McCartney.  What was I going to say?  That's true.  What was I going to try to be cool about it?  I met McCartney.  He was fucking cool.  Yeah.  That'd be all right.  Yeah, exactly.  You should have met him as Chip.  You should have had a picture of Chip with no one could say.  Oh, God.  No, I've done a few Chip pictures, but I didn't have the balls to do it with McCartney.  Oh, man.  Chip would have known what to say intuitively.  I did say something to him.  What'd you say?  I was like, hey, fucking, what's up with the Beatles? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, God.  Damn it.  It's a fucking Michelle Bachman.  It's hot.  Hey, Carl.  Yeah.  Rich has also admitted that he's dabbling in the gambling game.  That's what we thought you were calling about because you cared about your friend.  Yeah, we thought you heard that.  Terrible person.  Joey doing it for Opie.  Yeah.  He's dabbling again.  He is, huh?  Sure.  What are you doing?  Dabbling.  Shooting some craps.  We're not happy about it.  Just a little.  I played the lotto a couple times. 
[01:34:00]  No, tell me what else you did.  Don't lie.  And I played craps twice in about seven years.  When did you play craps?  Last summer at MGM Graham for one night.  MGM Graham?  MGM Graham.  He said Graham.  He said Graham.  He said it twice now.  MGM Graham.  MGM Graham.  He'll be buying Coke soon.  And you also, not twice in seven years, twice since last summer.  No.  Yeah, not once in seven years.  Okay, but that's easy to say.  It's like if I drank yesterday and I said I drank once in 26 years. 
[01:34:30]  It was yesterday.  Yeah.  Just a way to kind of trick yourself a little bit.  I think he's done it more than twice.  I'm worried about Voss.  Here's what I'm saying.  And I, like I have a complete dedication and hold on sobriety.  I quit smoking about 10 years now.  Cool.  Okay.  Red meat, 22 years.  Okay.  So once in a blue moon, I played craps when I worked in a casino. 
[01:35:00]  I, you know, here's the thing in life.  Yeah.  I completely stopped everything.  Sure.  You have hookers.  All right.  But I'm not judging you morally.  We're talking about what you, you see, that's, let me explain the justification of the ad.  First of all, when you're arrested for rape, you can't get off by pointing out all the  girls you didn't rape.  You don't, you don't, hold on.  He's talking out of experience.  You don't lift all the shit that you've quit because none of that is relevant to your gambling.  Like, I understand.  Yes, you're right. 
[01:35:30]  I'm still active on my sex addiction.  I still watch way too much porn.  Absolutely.  But we're not talking about that right now.  We're talking about your, I'm not judging you and saying I'm better than you.  So, I'm saying why I understand how fucked up that is.  I know.  But how often is he going to get a casino gig?  It's really not a problem.  If it's only casinos, you'll probably maybe once the rest of your life.  And also, lottery tickets fell out of his jacket because we wanted to see his jacket.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  It was awful.  It was a lottery slip.  He's wearing a slip, exactly. 
[01:36:00]  He's wearing illegal merchandise today from Breaking Bad.  It's a Breaking Bad jacket.  A knockoff.  It's a knockoff, and he's bragging about it, and then he took the jacket off, and then  we saw all the lottery tickets on the inside pocket.  He thinks it's Breaking Bad.  It was from Breaking 2.  Right.  Boo.  First of all, it's not illegal.  Sure it is.  No, it isn't.  How do you know?  You go to the website.  How do you even know it's illegal?  Sure.  No one's going to stop.  I'm just making a dumb joke.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Take it easy, fucking.  Right.  Who cares?  Or the website, guys. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  I think it's a knockoff, but who cares?  So why don't you go back to the 12-step stuff for fucking gambling?  What are you doing?  You're right.  Of course, it's a knockoff stuff.  You're absolutely right.  Oh, man.  And sometimes you need friends like this to point things out so you can head down the  right path.  Yeah.  I don't want to see boss gambling.  I don't know if you have any friends like this, but no.  Wait, no, no.  Who needs enemies, right, Carl?  This was like an early morning intervention, and I want to thank all you guys. 
[01:37:00]  That's it.  I'm not going to cry.  I'm just going to do the right thing.  Watch this.  You've never cried in your life.  You have no emotion.  Oh, shit.  Here he goes.  Yesterday's lottery.  He's ripping up the ticket that you go in and buy the lottery tickets with.  And if there's any god, it's a winner.  You can't win on the fucking slip.  Let me tell you something.  If boss can't cry, because his last tears dried up.  He used them all up at side splitters in tamper. 
[01:37:30]  Tamper.  After his 10th time there.  Tamper.  Tamper.  They're in February.  My wife is calling me now.  Oh, good.  We'll put her on speaker.  Hello, hold on.  Do you know how to do that?  All right, hold on.  We're going to put her on speaker.  Hello, can you hear me?  You can't cry.  You're on speaker.  Hold on.  With Collins on the phone, and Norton's here, and O.P. and Anthony.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Bonnie.  Hey. 
[01:38:00]  Who was laughing in the background?  Oh, shit.  That was me laughing.  That's just because you've never heard my laugh before.  Oh, this shit fucking...  Wow.  What are you calling for? 
[01:38:30]  What's up?  I don't know how you know that Homeland is still downloading.  Oh.  The two episodes from last night?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, I'm doing probably the third biggest radio station in New York, and you're going  to call me to tell me that Homeland is still downloading.  Homeland is still downloading.  Homeland stinks.  Homeland stinks?  Stinks.  Do you watch the Americans?  No, I've not seen that.  Fucking great.  Great, but Homeland stinks.  Well, we're on the second season. 
[01:39:00]  What's that?  Norton said Homeland...  Oh, you know what?  They lost me in this.  I like the first season.  Season two lost me.  It's typical showtime, so you tell me what you think by the end of season two.  Well, and if Norton sticks his eyes out when he says it stinks, it really stinks.  I have good taste in TV shows.  Okay.  When he overacts on something that stinks, you know it stinks.  All right, look.  I have bad taste in France, but I do have good taste in France.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Stop thinking.  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, listen.  Thank you for calling in.  Anything you'd like to plug?  All I have, like, Dukes and Roxy tonight.  Dukes and Roxy in New Jersey?  The one-nighter?  The big fundraiser?  The one-nighter?  You're doing it?  The fundraiser for I don't know what.  Wow.  Hmm.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Great.  Hopefully it's a fundraiser for women whose husbands are terminally ill.  That's what you're hoping. 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  That was terrific.  Well, she did get a great one in.  Oh, boy.  Wow, what a slam that was.  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, fuck.  We took a major test yesterday with Dr. Steve, the Myers-Briggs test, which we'll play on  our podcast next week.  Who's Myers-Briggs?  The people that invented the test.  Right.  But who are they?  What kind of test is it?  It's some stupid pharmaceutical company that invented the big test.  Oh, hold on.  I didn't know he was still on. 
[01:40:30]  Look at him trying to put his headphones on because he's eating eggs.  It's to see if you're compatible, what kind of people you are.  All right, Colin.  We've got to get back to Voss.  Bye, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Bye-bye, Colin.  Another terrific phone call from Colin Quinn.  That guy is a national treasure.  He sure is.  He should be buried.  The worst is yet to come.

[01:45:00]  I didn't think so.  Since 1921, my family has been using the same all-natural recipe for our delicious meatballs and slow-cooked Italian red sauce.  My grandmother was all about heritage and family tradition.  At Mama Mancini's, we are continuing that tradition by making all-natural, authentic dishes that any grandmother would love.  Mama Mancini's, they make me want to say...  Mama Mancini's, the meatball lover we saw.  Available at your local supermarkets.  The worst of the week countdown. 
[01:45:30]  No!  Continues.  Moving right along with the worst of the week countdown, I'm Sam Roberts, and I host this every week.  So by now, you should know who I am.  Highlighting the very best of the Opie and Anthony show from this week.  Still to come, Michelle Beadle, Russell Peters, E-Rock, back from vacation after his cell phone number was given out on the air.  But right now, Pete Holmes in studio.

Moving right along here.  There he is.  We welcome to the show for the first time, Pete Holmes.  Promoting the Pete Holmes show.  That works out pretty good.  I see your commercials all the time.  Hell yeah, man.  You saw televised commercials? 
[01:46:30]  I saw the televised commercials.  That's exciting.  This is exciting.  Thank you so much.  This is really exciting.  I'm watching Seinfeld or something, and you'll pop on there.  I am interrupting the best comedy ever.  What the fuck?  Just like this doughy, amorphous face.  This guy.  I am a rhombus, and they gave me a show.  Wearing clothes that obviously aren't mine.  They told me this is what handsome is.  I'm doing my best, fellas, but I am a fraud.  I need help.  Can you help me? 
[01:47:00]  I'm glad you saw it.  This is a thrill to be here.  I'm a big fan of the show.  I love this.  Oh, my goodness.  So that means we'll be booked on your show, right?  Of course, yeah.  All right.  You do that sort of stuff?  You guys are doing five days a week.  Oh, I know.  We work very hard here on that.  We're never asked.  Never asked.  Oh, we have been asked.  We've done all the big shows, but we do them like once or twice, and that's about it.  Does that never go away?  I mean, here you are at the top of the radio, man, and you're still...  I like this.  Yeah, right?  I'm going to break you right open.  Oh, I like this. 
[01:47:30]  That just reminds me of comedians.  You know, it always is kind of like, why aren't they asking?  Oh, it's never enough.  Like the biggest guys I know are like, why didn't they ask me to host the open mic?  Yeah, yeah.  It's never enough.  No, TV's way cooler for us.  This radio thing's easy, and it's like almost...  Who cares?  TV's pretty cool.  TV's got it, right?  But people know your faces.  Yeah, because of the social, you know, media and stuff, finally.  But we went years with no one really knowing what we look like.  Sure.  Those posters in the neighborhood.  You've got to get on them.  What do you mean? 
[01:48:00]  Get around Halloween.  Put the fucking photos up.  The wall says I have to put them up.  Exactly.  I'm not allowed to get the candy out.  But that leads to a lot of frustration.  Actually, I'm not trying to bring in some obscure credit of mine, but I drew New Yorker cartoons for a time.  No shit.  No more frustrated group of...  Because that's show business, too.  It's just like this weird subsection.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one knows what Jack Ziegler looks like.  Yeah, there you go.  Bruce Eric Kaplan wrote that episode.  That's a great...  Who is a New Yorker cartoonist.  Wow, he did?  Yeah, yeah.  And a very, very funny television producer. 
[01:48:30]  It's a Ziggy.  I like the kitty.  It's fucking great, man.  Hey, wait.  Would you come up with the cartoons or just draw the picture that someone else conceptualized?  They won't let you do that.  It's kind of like stand-up, and it's like you've got to write your own material, and you've got to draw it.  And they used to be like, this looks like you drew it with your foot.  And it took me a really long time.  Hundreds of cartoons before they finalized it.  And just like show business, it's because Jack Ziegler, who's kind of a big deal there, saw it and liked it and put in a word for the kid. 
[01:49:00]  I was submitting every week, and they were just like...  They were nice about it, but they would pretty much laugh at my horrible drawings.  But did you notice that, like the Seinfeld episodes, sometimes you read them and go, I don't even know what that means.  I am a...  Can you swear?  Oh, yeah.  Please do.  I'm a goddamn professional comedian, and there's so many that I look at, and I'm like, no!  You have failed!  You have failed!  I know comedy!  I lived in New York!  I know subtlety!  I know auteur!  I know these...  Inter-office politics.  Yeah.  There's no way.  There's nothing that I haven't experienced. 
[01:49:30]  I should get this cartoon.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a goldfish shrugging.  Well, the Republicans must know.  What?  What?  What does that mean?  Exactly.  Jimmy used to do a bit on the show, which I loved, and I wish we'll bring it back someday.  Him reading the comic strips in the newspaper.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, the funny papers.  They're so awful.  The funny papers.  It's just unbelievable.  That just seems like a medium that is...  It's archaic.  It should have been done away with years ago.  The comic strip in the paper, where you're literally picking up paper and reading it.  You get it on your hands? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's...  Oh, your silly putty on it.  It's from the 30s.  Stretch it out!  Why is it still in the paper?  Like, Hager the Horrible.  Who reads this?  Shit!  Who's writing it?  Who's at home going...  Yeah, yeah.  Who's still writing it?  Hagar.  Hagar.  What would this...  Something with a ham on a platter?  I got nothing.  Yeah.  As long as no one badmouths Kathy, because Kathy is terrific.  Oh, yes.  That's a smart person.  Looking for a guy still.  Yeah.  Isn't she just a girl?  Garfield, doesn't she?  Hate Mondays and needs love. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's that whole...  And her mom has always given her flack about her lack of relationships.  But she's from the 60s, too.  Oh, yeah.  They're all like...  Good news.  ...Bring to star?  Good news.  The paper says today, Doonesbury's on vacation and will return November 18th.  Thank God that fucking comic is...  Thank God it's just on vacation.  I never get what they're talking about.  And then the few times I do, it just annoys me.  Yeah, of course.  It's very...  When I was a kid, I thought when I grew up, I would get Doonesbury. 
[01:51:00]  I'm no closer.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a cigarette talking to the congressman, and you're just like, what the fuck is this?  I don't know these words.  It's like, I guess I better just move to the fucking peanuts.  That's as close as a kid comes to feeling like you have to go to work.  You're reading the funnies, and you're like, Garfield, he delivers.  Kathy, a classic.  Doonesbury, a classic.  Give me a cup of black coffee.  Oh, Doonesbury.  Focus.  You gotta focus.  Can I just remain a kid for a little longer?  It was a reminder. 
[01:51:30]  It's taking my innocence.  Yeah, your innocence is fleeting.  You will one day have a job, and this will be what you think is supposed to be funny.  Marmaduke, help me.  Yeah, Doonesbury.  Worse than the creepy father's family circus.  Oh, I just like it that had a little foot map of where they'd been that day.  But it was always hilarious.  Oh, it was cute.  They went in a lot of circles.  Adorable.  It was tough to get from point A to point B.  He didn't go straight.  Nope.  He's a child.  He's got a nickel in his pocket.  He's gonna go to that candy shop. 
[01:52:00]  And now he's gonna see a dog getting straggled.  We get it.  It's terrible.  I like when the footsteps disappear, and then you just see, like, a little drawing of Ariel Castro's van.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that gets flawed.  Oh, no.  That's a flawed.  Left panel's an amber alert.  This is a real...  Wait, before we move on.  Sorry.  Did you hear how he died?  We haven't even talked about it yet.  Oh, yeah.  Ariel Castro.  They said, yeah.  He was doing the sex thing. 
[01:52:30]  The, uh, how do you...  Mono-erotic investigation.  Right, right.  That's just when they say...  He was found with his pants down.  And that's when the Illuminati kills you.  We all know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mean to burr it out here, but that's true.  There's no way...  That part of the Illuminati, true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shape-shifting lizard people have a great sense of humor.  And if they're gonna murder you, they're gonna make it look like you were jerking it in a new way.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the way they take you out.  Maybe that's what happened.  Maybe the guards killed him and dropped his pants, like, in the wire.  Right.  To make it look like, fuck it, and he committed suicide.  Oh, they did that.  That's exactly right. 
[01:53:00]  It might be...  You can't plant crack on someone like that, but everyone has a dick.  Yeah, he has a dick out.  Hey, he had a dick.  I forgot the crack.  Take it out.  Plausible deniability.  Stupid me.  I was believing the story.  That's just dumb nowadays.  Well, David Carradine, too.  Yes.  But that's a big...  I can't represent this conspiracy well, but he also was supposedly died from...  And he had some girly clothes on him, too.  Yeah, but I mean...  What about the girly clothes?  Yeah.  Girly clothes?  The girly clothes?  That is...  He had the girly clothes on.  I believe he has a good show.  I need to learn that move right there. 
[01:53:30]  What about them girly clothes?  Yeah.  And then just back to him.  It keeps it family-friendly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You gotta learn that.  I loved it.  I forget what it was, but he must have owed money or something, but people on the internet  really blew up and were, like, issue.  If it's a revenge...  What's better than that?  A revenge kill?  You murder your nemesis, and you make a...  Everyone talk about the girly clothes he was wearing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You make it hurt.  Yeah.  Death isn't good enough for this guy.  Let's make it hurt after he's dead.  Nobody's doing that.  He was found with girly clothes on.  Nobody's doing auto...  No.  Jim? 
[01:54:00]  No, never.  Although, I will say, I have been choked while jerking off, but very rarely.  It's not my thing.  Wait, someone else choked you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the safe way to do it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How did it feel?  Well, it felt okay for a couple minutes.  I couldn't go full bore on it.  A couple minutes?  No, I mean, on and off.  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  Okay, okay, okay.  I came on my shoes.  I've had girls ask to choke them.  They're like, oh, just choke me a little bit.  Choke a lady.  And I put my hand there, and I start pushing.  I'm just like, oh, I can't do this. 
[01:54:30]  It doesn't feel right.  It doesn't feel right.  Well, sex is already violent.  I mean, like, it's a violent...  It's a weird...  It's aggressive.  It's not violent.  It's aggressive.  There's an aggressive thing going on.  I have a theory that even kissing...  I do this bit on stage.  Forgive me.  I don't think it's loving to tell your girlfriend that, like, oh, boo-boo, I love you.  I want to roll you in powdered sugar.  I don't think that's real intimacy.  Real intimacy to me is tenderly explaining to my girlfriend that I could kill her unarmed.  I find that very funny.  That's true, and that's real.  That's not a bit.  That's true.  Right.  I get these little girlfriends, because I'm a giant, and I'm just like, you could stop me for a bit. 
[01:55:00]  I think that's real love.  You probably find it off, but you're going to get tired real fast.  But that...  And I don't.  And I don't.  I choose.  I love you.  I love you.  I never would.  That's what everything...  Like, kissing is basically, I could be eating you.  I could be biting you.  Right, right.  Like, I'm kissing your neck, your sensitive areas, and sex itself is very aggressive.  And you're like, look, look, it's safe.  There's thrusting and yelling.  She's in a thing for pleasure with the threat of violence, almost mimicking violence, but a pleasurable honor.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  There's something kind of Aztec-y, sort of like human sacrifice about it.  It's like, this is right at the cusp of a volcano,  but I'm not going to throw you in.  Oh, yeah.  And you're not going to throw me in.  And the person choking Jim didn't throw him in.  Right.  That's why that's like an instinct, to be like, it's all cannibalism.  But what happens in your...  What happened while you were growing up that you need this shit to be choked out and stuff?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  Or is he just highly evolved?  No, he's really...  Jimmy's not even really into it.  No, I'm not even into it.  Yeah, Jimmy's not into it.  I'll do it to a girl if she really wants to, but even that's... 
[01:56:00]  Does that turn you on, though?  Not really.  It feels uncomfortable to choke her too much.  Oh, I meant him being choked.  I meant you...  The sensation was okay, and the fact that she was doing something so inappropriate,  but it was just to try it a few times.  It's not my...  It's not a fetish for me at all.  Can I just say, that's an interesting thing about sex fetishers.  I was reading this thing about porn.  I've been off porn.  And I said, I have no ethical problem.  I'm just giving it a break.  I've been reading about...  I know.  I still...  Wait, wait, wait.  Just a little heads up.  Yeah.  It's still out there.  It's still going strong.  Let me know.  It's still there. 
[01:56:30]  You mean they're not suffering from my lack of business?  Nope, nope.  Like the guy that's like...  Wait, what research have you done that you're offered for a while?  I'll tell you a good one.  Well, it's boring stuff, but it's kind of like about how your brain can't tell the difference  between like a fantasy and reality, and like it starts to numb you.  I'll tell you this.  I went off porn and...  Really?  Absolutely.  Oh, my God.  I went off porn and jerking it for two months.  Two months.  Are you listening?  It's amazing.  Then I had sex with this girl.  I say, amazing.  Amazing.  Because you're allowing yourself to need someone else. 
[01:57:00]  Instead of just scratching an itch every time you have it and shooting a blank into the  air whenever you have the urge, you actually are...  That's love.  You're needing someone else to help you.  And you're more...  I didn't know I was going to get all Tony Robbins.  It was the best sex of my life.  It was wonderful for her, too.  What a great way to put it.  You allow yourself to need somebody.  You're right about the numbing.  Totally.  What a fucking great way to put it.  Allow yourself...  Instead of scratching every itch you get.  God damn it.  Just sit down and go, I need somebody, and I don't have anybody. 
[01:57:30]  I'm just going to eat a sandwich and wait it out.  I just have to fucking write.  Watch TV.  I mean, we make fun of the kids today.  We're just as bad.  We're all instant gratification monsters.  Yeah.  Just like, I want pizza.  And you're eating pizza 20 minutes later.  And then we're looking at kids tweeting.  We're tweeting with our fucking pizza.  Were you jonesing, though?  Were you jonesing for it?  Well, porn?  Yeah, were you jonesing?  Well, I'll tell you the story.  I was talking about being off-born on stage.  And then I got off stage, and this guy came up to me, and he goes, this is completely true.  Every word of what I'm saying is true.  He goes, Peter, I just want to say congratulations. 
[01:58:00]  And I thought he meant the show.  I was like, oh, thanks, man.  I hope you like the show.  And he goes, no, on your abstinence.  On your abstinence.  Congrats.  It's hard to keep that beast off your back.  It's been two years for me.  Two years.  Stay strong.  Congratulations.  Holy shit.  Now, I grew up religious, and I don't like the word abstinence.  So the first thing I did when I got home was fired up the laptop.  And reluctantly jerked it.  It wasn't even...  The guy totally fucked up your...  He did.  He broke my streak.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because nobody tells me what to do.  Right.  You understand?  I'm not in your weird abstinence club.  Yeah, don't compliment me, you fucking douche. 
[01:58:30]  You fucking weirdo.  I'm not like you.  Nobody tells me when to feel good.  I'm King Ralph.  I'm going to jerk off of my butt.  I feel like it.  I didn't even want to.  It was an act of defiance against this guy who has no stake in my life.  Yes.  But I was like, this is my time.  Here's the other interesting jerky jerk stuff.  And this is what made me think of it.  With the choking and people that kind of get to a certain point where you need to do weirder and weirder things.  Yeah.  People that get really, really into porn, straight people, will start to watch stranger and stranger things. 
[01:59:00]  And that's true in my life.  You start with some, I don't know, a girl playing with herself and you're like, yeah, this is what I'm doing.  You know, it's kind of like a parallel universe.  Comrontery, yeah.  Yeah, it's a good solidarity jerk.  And then you work your way up to whatever.  And then before you know it, people are squirting and all this sort of stuff.  And who have you become?  And that gets even crazier if you stay on that train and if you have a certain personality.  And what I read about that was very interesting is straight men, men that, I mean, they might be lying, but they're saying they're straight for sure. 
[01:59:30]  They're like, I am a straight person.  I started watching gay pornography.  This isn't me, but this is other people.  I shouldn't say this because out of context.  They would start watching gay pornography, like guy-on-guy pornography, because it was the only thing that was a taboo anymore.  The only thing left that isn't shocking.  They need to shock.  I've heard through the system, yeah.  People have straight sex, they have sex with their girlfriends, and they need to turn on gay pornography.  There needs to be some sort of taboo.  I know.  I don't like gay pornography, but I do understand the taboo part.  Like the transsexual stuff, it feels taboo. 
[02:00:00]  Like watching that, all that shit feels things like, I'll smell a girl's foot now, which never used to turn me on, but it's something different.  It's not on her body at the time, which is realistic.  That's the sickest part of it.  No, what you do is, like if it was a hooker, I would want to have loving moments with her.  And if it was a girlfriend, I would want her to tell me how she'd rather be fucking someone else.  Oh, interesting.  Completely the opposite.  That makes perfect sense.  I've seen the gay porn, but I've got to tell you, from the other side of the camera. 
[02:00:30]  But them fucking or sucking each other off isn't even the worst part.  When they start getting real intimate.  Thanks to kissing.  It's like, oh.  It's the vacation planning.  The mimosa pouring is really what gets you going.  I love this part.  They're having a tiff.  They leave that in.  They're more in touch with their emotions.  It's a good thing.  Kit feels fat and Noel is not comforting him.  Well, here's my theory on all this taboo stuff. 
[02:01:00]  Is that like, sex being a moral, like I said, I grew up religious.  So I honestly think the best fucking is like religious fucking.  If you think sex is bad and you fuck, it's the best.  I swear to you.  I've said this on my own podcast.  Fuck like you're going to hell for it.  It's the greatest thing.  It's fun to take off your pants because you can't take off your pants.  You know what I mean?  Like if you're a hippie and you're a fully evolved person and you understand that there's nothing wrong.  This is all true.  Nothing wrong with the human body.  Nothing wrong with sex or sexuality. 
[02:01:30]  Fucking is probably great and beautiful and spiritual, but it's not going to have that dirty charge.  I shouldn't be like you're doing something wrong.  The pastor of my church had an affair and I bet that was like the best thing.  How religious were you?  You brought it up a couple of times.  Yeah, I know.  And where did it go wrong?  What religion?  Regular.  A Catholic?  Right.  You know, the real one, the correct, proper one.  No, I grew up Protestant, which is funny because Catholicism is, of course, older.  How deep were you guys into it as a family? 
[02:02:00]  It was kind of my thing, to be honest.  I was raised that way, but then I was looking for identity.  Just like anybody.  So I look like a youth pastor.  I make that joke a lot.  I almost was a youth pastor.  Wow.  But then I got divorced and that's kind of a cliche, but that's when it went sideways a  little bit for me.  Yeah.  And it was one of the best things that ever happened to me.  What do you believe in?  What do I believe in now?  Yeah.  Just about everything.  I'm just like one of those weird people that is curious about everything religious and  spiritual, but also nothing.  I mean, like believing in everything also believes in nothing.  I love atheists.  I love atheism.  I love people that are hardcore science, but I also love these kind of more nutty people that believe 
[02:02:30]  it.  Do you have this thought of like one single entity that kind of rules over everything?  Yeah.  That we are all part of one consciousness that we call God.  Yeah.  And we're the eyes of the universe observing itself.  Does Deepak record here?  Yeah.  We've had him on.  Have you had him on?  We've had Deepak on.  It was fun to watch that documentary with him and his son did.  Because his son doesn't respect him.  He's got to be here with him.  Right.  All he's done.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to see it.  He's fed up.  Ah!  Yeah.  His son was done.  His son basically thinks he's full of shit. 
[02:03:00]  Really?  He needs to know the truth.  Yes.  That's surprising.  That's typical.  It's great.  It's a really good documentary.  What is it called?  I'm going to write that down.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Decoding Deepak.  Very good.  Oh, I could see.  That was a great one-woman show.  It was the woman that played Pat.  I'm forgetting her name.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sweeney, maybe?  Yeah, it was Sweeney.  She did a one-woman show called Letting Go of God, which I listened to right after my  divorce.  Because I looked at my faith as like a room.  Julia Sweeney.  Julia Sweeney.  Oh, very good.  There was all this furniture in it. 
[02:03:30]  And that was like my religion furniture.  And then when I got divorced, I kind of took everything out and decided what I wanted  to put back in.  But that added choice to it.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh, yeah.  I just inherited this furniture from my church and from my family.  And then I was a grown man for the first time in my life.  And I was like, maybe this end table is fucked.  Maybe this end table that hates gays is going out the window.  Maybe that one doesn't come back.  Maybe this one that says, this lamp that says all Jews are going to burn forever in conscious  eternal torment.  Maybe that's not in vibe with my Jesus. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, shit, that's funny.  I'm going to keep the Jesus rug because he's all right.  But then the weird Deepak one.  Yeah.  But also, you know, I don't have any idols.  If Deepak is full of shit, then that's fine.  That's fine, too.  Right, right.  I think people should be allowed to be a little bit full of shit.  When did, like, as a host, as somebody that's about to host a show, there's this standard  that you're supposed to, like, know everything and read books and shit.  I'm a fucking dummy.  I'm a dumb-dumb all day.  Welcome to the club.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I put on a blazer and I host a show and suddenly I'm already getting mad at people, things 
[02:04:30]  that they haven't said yet.  Right.  I'm still going to be the same stupid person that isn't going to know things.  Like, why should Deepak Chopra be right all the time?  Why shouldn't his son be fed up with him?  Yeah.  Why shouldn't he say some things that he's regretting or are just complete bullshit?  I respect that Deepak allowed that out there.  Absolutely.  He could have told his son, no fucking way are we doing this, but he said, ah, sure,  why not?  Really?  We'll have fun with it.  Yeah.  I think because he owns that whole, like, that's a side of me.  I'm full of shit.  We like Deepak. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  He's all right.  He had the best Twitter, like, he has Twitter haters.  And when he got a Twitter hater, somebody was like, you suck, you're full of shit, I hate  your face, whatever.  He wrote back, he quoted the tweet, and he said, I have your reflection, which I just  think, isn't that the best?  That's great.  I can suck on that righteous dick.  That's where all that shit comes from, though, man.  I wish I could think of that instead of writing, fuck you, your mother's a whore.  I know.  That's where all that shit comes from, if you really want to get into it.  Of course it is.  That's what they feel about their fucking selves, man. 
[02:05:30]  Period.  Why would you have such a strong reaction unless you were seeing the tumor growing in you?  That's exactly where it comes from.  Is that why I tweet other men and go, you're a lousy fucker?  You might be gay.  Yeah, just let it all out on Twitter.  I just attack other people with my own stuff.  Help yourself.  Help yourself.

The worst of the week countdown. 
[02:10:00]  Yes, indeed.  You know what you're listening to.  The worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts,  highlighting everything good that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week.  I know you've been waiting for it.  We'll get some resolution on E-Rock and the fact that his cell phone number was given out on the air last week.  In a few minutes.  First, Michelle Beadle.  You may know her from ESPN, from NBC Sports.  Well, those shows were canceled.  She's still on Access Hollywood.  She's still hilarious.  She's still hot.  She was in studio along with Russell Peters. 
[02:10:30]  Not only one of the funniest comedians there is,  but one of the richest as well.  He had a lot to say.  She had a lot to say.  We all had a lot to say.  Opie not in studio for this one, but it's still wonderful.  Michelle Beadle, Russell Peters, in studio, here on The Countdown.  Number two.  Number two.  Bring her in.  Come on in.  Take a seat.  Hey.  You have a lot of space in here.  Can I just dump that?  Hey, go take a seat right there. 
[02:11:00]  Russell, honey.  You know Russell?  Hi, Michelle.  What's up, lover?  How are you?  Michelle.  Hi, how are you?  We're on the air, by the way.  Oh, good north.  Yeah, we do that, you know.  Can I curse?  I can't curse.  Yeah, you can curse.  No, I still have to protect the brand, as they say.  Why?  Hi, Sam.  Hello.  You could curse.  Oh, well.  I know.  It's my wrestling.  A little rapport between the two of you?  Yeah, Michelle and I go, wait a minute.  Wow.  No, it smells like egg.  It's egg whites.  Oh.  Egg whites.  I don't know.  It's so, um, I think you could cut something else. 
[02:11:30]  To make up for the fact that.  Yes.  Egg whites are like fucking rubber.  Yeah.  And yolk is the only thing that makes an egg enjoyable at all.  And it's like, that yolk, just fucking for lunch, don't have like one more of whatever  you're having.  No, I got acid reflux.  That's why I have to avoid them.  Oh, well, that's different.  I'm a dick.  Really?  Like, I'm old, I'm old.  I got the acid reflux.  I think I have that too, but.  Yeah.  What is yolk?  Does it?  A little yolk comes up?  Yeah, the yolk fucks me up.  You give a burp and it's like, oh.  Yeah, it's like, ah, Jesus. 
[02:12:00]  Why are my eyes watering from a burp?  A nice yolk-y burp.  Yeah, it's not fun.  Yeah.  Bad times.  Getting old sucks.  Bad times in my internals.  What a depressing room I just walked into.  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  Hey, this is the good part.  You missed a minute ago.  Yeah.  Did you go off on something?  No, we were just listening to Bad, Bad Radio.  Bad Radio.  Jocktober.  The whole month is Jocktober.  The whole month of Bad Radio that we feature.  I like that.  From various markets.  Do they know you're doing it before you do it?  Not before, but right after, for some reason, the fans of the show run rampant on their Facebook 
[02:12:30]  page, station page, posting everything from horrifically racist pictures and comments to progeria  children to Hitler.  Wow.  They want to take it in their Facebook page down and cleaning it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Why can't we just do things without everyone tattletaling all the time?  You can say one word and ten minutes later you're in trouble.  Well, nowadays, with what the kids call the social media, there's no secrets anymore. 
[02:13:00]  Nothing's private.  Nothing.  You can't tell anybody anything.  It'll get out.  You can't walk around without a picture being taken of you if you're doing something.  Yeah, maybe you have somebody in the car who has a questionable gender.  You're driving.  Somebody snaps a photo of your 5'11 girlfriend without heels.  Maybe it's a lady friend who stands up and pees.  Yeah, exactly.  Delightful girl.  Wow.  Or a nice close picture of some razor stubble.  No?  We get it.  It's weird.  How come they canceled your show? 
[02:13:30]  I like doing it.  What happened?  That's probably why, by the way.  I'm the kiss of death.  No.  No, no, no.  I think it's as simple as...  I wish it was the death of kiss.  I probably just...  Hey, Gene.  I don't know.  Maybe they don't like...  Maybe they didn't like me.  I don't know.  You're very good on that show.  I think it's going to all work out in the end, honestly.  I mean, I'm still under the umbrella of playing nice right now.  Oh.  But I just...  You know, I think it was one of those...  Some people had one idea, and the suits that are actually in charge had another, and that's 
[02:14:00]  the way they decided to go.  What didn't they like about it?  Maybe it wasn't male enough.  Really?  I don't know.  Did they think it was...  I thought it was pretty harsh.  I thought it was a fun show.  Yeah, I did, too.  Some of the humor was harsh, and I was like, why wouldn't they like that on a fucking sports  network?  On a network that's, you know...  Look, apparently I got in trouble for saying something about the network in the first place.  It's not a network I necessarily watch, because there's not a lot I want to watch.  So, you know...  Oh, boy.  Did you say that while you were on the network?  Yeah, I'm still technically on the network.  That could be the problem right there.  I know.  Honesty kills you. 
[02:14:30]  Well, yeah, if you bash, you know...  But not bashing.  I just...  I think that there's room for different types of programming, and I guess that they just  want to keep it a certain way, and so probably not an awesome...  Did you say one of the other shows probably couldn't get Paul McCartney as a guest?  What?  Well...  Did y'all say that?  No, just something that's going on here with the show that's on After Us.  Some little scumbag said, you know, that Paul McCartney, like, why would he do this  show?  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:15:00]  Fuck him.  Absolutely.  Little prick.  That's exactly right.  Why would Paul McCartney do this show?  It's a fair question.  When you pose it that way...  Now that you're saying it, when you pose it that way, it's like, you know...  I know, there's so much...  When you pose the question, owning a vagina, it's a little different.  It's different, right?  It's different.  Yeah, but I do blame you.  Oh, shit.  Everything that embraces me dies.  It's amazing.  Like, Michelle liked me and had me on her show often, and I loved doing it, and therefore,  I was not surprised that I heard you have a chance of Michelle Bueble's show. 
[02:15:30]  I'm like, I could have told you that.  You know, Sam was on the show, though, too.  I was on...  It could be his fault.  Yeah, I'm probably more the kiss of death than you.  I remember that.  I watched it.  He's visually...  Unappearing.  He is very odd-looking.  I don't know what our audience is, but...  We're all in agreement, then?  That's one voice in the room?  You look like an almost black cartoon character.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  I think you look like Sideshow Bob's brother.  That's the one that comes in.  Yeah.  A lot.  Sideshow Bob.  Which is great.  But I met his wife.  She's really hot.  His wife is very hot.  Yes.  That threw me off. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  That continues to happen in the world.  I'm very charming.  Yeah, he gets fucking hot.  Women, I'm just fucking pigs all day.  Pigs.  Why don't you just stop and aim higher?  I do.  You should get him right in the neck.  But he married the girl, though.  Yeah, see, that's...  Yeah.  That's...  And he actually likes her, from what I can tell.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Well, obviously, it's going to go that way, but how's the other way?  Does she like...  Yeah.  Does she like him? 
[02:16:30]  Of course she likes me.  Or she just...  What did you guys do the day I saw you?  You fucking did a marathon or some shit?  What?  You were in a marathon?  No, I don't think...  We might have done boot camp.  Yeah, boot camp.  Together?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exercise together.  Knock in the boots camp.  No, I don't.  Oh, I think she probably was really doing it up, and you were like...  I call her the motivating factor, yeah.  You were a piece of shit.  Yeah, Jeff was just...  Yeah, Jeff.  I was just...  Jeff.  I call her Jeff.  Jeff.  Yeah, that's what I've made frequently.  You know your wife, Jeff. 
[02:17:00]  Can I call you Jeffica?  Jeffica's hot.  She's really hot, and I talked to them about that.  She and I were talking about it when I went up to Sam and his wife, and she's like, yeah,  we did a boot camp, and Sam threw up.  I did throw up.  You did?  Yeah, the first time.  I did throw up.  Aw.  That's good.  Now, do you work out regularly?  No.  Okay, so that's kind of a rough...  Look at his arm.  That was very polite of you to ask a question that you could look and see the answer to.  Well, you know, you never know.  Some people work out religiously, and you can't tell.  High tendon strength.  Look at his arms.  Well, that could be...  There's nothing there.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  They're terrible.  Yeah, he's a needle away from my own invention.  I said I don't work out like that.  I've been established.  What else?  God, your outfit's horrible.  I don't think so.  Those colors don't even match.  What is that?  You're right.  He's wearing shit brown pants.  You look like a crappy tree in the fall.  He says Rockstar Games and Black Sabbath t-shirt.  Way to break the mold.  Exactly.  You...  You...  Honestly, you look like a piece of shit from someone with colon cancer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little red tip on it.  Yes, yes.  I don't...  You look like a bloody stool.  A dog dick. 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Well...  Why would you get pants the color of shit?  They're not...  That's not what color my shit is.  No, that is literally shit color.  Actually, a healthy poop should be that color.  I'm actually the color of those pants, you son of a bitch.  Oh, God damn it.  Wait a minute.  I...  Looks good on you, though.  I know.  That's different.  That's different.  If anybody was going to be shitty, it's going to be you, Russell.  I...  Like a dark gold.  A very fall color.  You think those are dark gold?  Yeah, I know.  They're dark gold.  Did they tell you that when you bought them?  If the dog ate a gold bar and shit it out. 
[02:18:30]  Wow, that's really something there.  Man.  And then the button shirts and stuff.  Yes, there's buttons on your shirt, too.  Hey, look.  Yeah, but it's open because he's cool.  Oh, open shirt.  Well, I think we've established...  It's open on Anthony.  It's our games.  Fucking army.  We don't like that you're trying to upgrade yourself in front of us.  I'm not trying to upgrade myself.  I'm upgrading myself.  Do you think you're better than everyone in this room?  Not everybody since you walked in.  Wow.  Wow, so you think you're better than me.  No, that's...  No, that's...  Well, maybe not Russell either, but...  Yeah, he's just very... 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, look, I mean...  Russell Peters has like a...  I stay fly, as the kids say.  Yeah, that's the kids said once.  Yeah.  Many years ago.  They said it in 86.  Yes.  But I'm still saying it.  Holy.  And what are you up to, Russell?  What are you doing?  I'm, you know, just going around promoting this Netflix thing next Monday.  Netflix!  You bet you're a shiny white ass, Anthony.  I love the Netflix.  You know what?  It's funny.  I've been in this deal with them for a year and a half, and we just announced it, but 
[02:19:30]  I never watched Netflix until about a month ago.  Why is that?  I didn't understand it.  I'm actually...  It's fantastic.  I was like, I would use YouTube to get to sleep.  Oh, man.  And I was like, ugh.  And then I would buy shit off iTunes, because I, you know, I'm the iPad.  That's what I do.  And everyone's like, why are you doing that?  And then I went to Netflix, and I go, are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  Everything is here.  It's so much better.  And it adjusts to whatever your bit rate is.  So if you've got shit internet, it'll still load the whole movie, but the quality won't 
[02:20:00]  be as great.  But you won't know.  But you get through it.  Yeah.  Sure.  It doesn't buffer halfway through.  And if you're sleeping, you just roll over and listen to the movie.  Yeah, I do that, too.  You fall asleep to white noise?  I do.  That's what I do.  Yeah.  What this radio show is.  It's the only noise I like.  You don't like falling asleep when you hear, motherfucker, wake up.  I don't hear that in my neighborhood.  I fucking, I've earned enough money to leave that whole shit behind.  Fuck that, and fuck those people. 
[02:20:30]  I've had it.  I want to do this show permanently.  I've had it.  I'll be free.  Out.  You may not have got Paul McCartney, but you've got a Beatle.  Anybody.  Come on.  That's true.  Hey, there you go.  That's good.  That was really good.  You don't think your network would be okay with you saying fuck that?  That's what I'm saying.  And fuck those people.  You've got some decisions to make.  Wow.  You've got some decisions to make.  I just don't like the idea of living in a horrible, crime-riddled neighborhood. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Loud criminals.  Oh, criminals.  You're the one that got all weird.  That's what I'm talking about.  I assumed he meant by that.  You can put race on anything.  I'm just talking about people that don't respect the law, don't respect human life.  I see.  Things like that.  I wasn't going to deal with those people.  Now, if you want to fucking...  I don't.  That's your hang-up, man.  That's your hang-up, man.  That's your hang-up, man.  Those are your issues you're bringing forward.  I wish Opie was here today.  That would be great.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie's probably judging one of those people in a court of law. 
[02:21:30]  He has jury duty, and of course...  He didn't get out of it?  Yeah.  How did he not get out of it?  He got out of it a while ago, but they only postponed it.  What kind of case?  I don't know.  I can't wait to hear.  If I ever do it, I want a good...  I want murder.  Probably somebody from a neighborhood where Anthony doesn't live.  Yes, I would guarantee that.  And, well...  Can you just hear the hatred and disdain in my voice?  You guys are racist. 
[02:22:00]  You're racist.  No, no.  I'm here to balance it out.  I love everybody.  Yeah.  I cross a few borders.  That's true.  There has not been one online beheading where the perpetrators weren't fans of Russell's.  That's true.  Any last words?  I'm going to get a heart real bad.  Clonk.  Hey, I'm going to the Middle East in a week.  You want to come in?  Are you?  I leave on Wednesday.  I'm friends with Greg... 
[02:22:30]  Rogel.  Rogel's a good friend of mine.  Hilarious, isn't he?  He's a very funny comic.  Very fucking mellow, deadpan guy.  Really good.  But he was talking about...  He was really...  He's Jewish.  Oh, boy.  Where are you going now?  You're going...  I'm going to like Oman, Qatar, Muscat, Abu Dhabi, and then India and Sri Lanka.  Wow.  It was a place he was very concerned about.  Yeah, he was all tripped out.  I was like, hey, Greg, you want to come?  He's like, hey, you know, I don't think I...  You know, I'm a Jew.  And I go...  They won't know, actually. 
[02:23:00]  They won't fucking know until you tell them.  Just don't whip your cock out.  You'll be good, you know?  Until they...  You get fucking people walking around going, no, you will...  Don't hold your passports in the air!  We're going to the safe places.  We're going to the safe places.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What was that movie?  Delta?  Delta Force?  Delta Burke.  No, not Delta Burke.  Oh, jackass.  That's got to be the worst feeling.  It's like, your passports get...  And you're like, with the big American passport.  There's nothing new.  I got a Canadian one.  I'm good.  Oh, see? 
[02:23:30]  That's smart.  Boy, no one gives a flying fuck about the Canadian.  I know.  They're like, go, look, can I play?  Just leave.  What are you going to do?  Cover me in syrup?  Go on, stupid.  Just go.  No one cares about you.  Just leave.  You know what?  They're going to get the last laugh.  I think Canada's been playing something for many decades.  Really?  I think they're tired and sick and tired of just being the butt of all of our jokes.  Yeah, but you know the thing over there?  We don't hear them.  No.  We just assume America doesn't know we're there.  We're just like, where's America?  They're right below us, but don't say anything. 
[02:24:00]  Christ, if they know we're here, they're going to come and get us, eh?  We never go higher than like 60 miles north of the border.  No, no, Toronto.  That's it.  Toronto, Montreal.  Toronto's my home.  That's it.  Yeah, you guys don't go past Buffalo.  That's Canada, right?  That's right.  I think it is.  To us, that was a big trip to New York when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Where are you going?  I'm going to New York.  Where?  Buffalo.  Buffalo, the big city.  Tonawanda.  Australia.  Wow.  What a shithole.  Yeah, I've done gigs there.  Just there.  I was just sitting in Rochester and yeah.  Stop bragging. 
[02:24:30]  I know.  You guys, I'm living the life, all right?  Why were you there?  Wrestling.  You like wrestling?  So much.  You were wrestling?  No, I wish.  Actually, no.  I found out this weekend, they can't take Xanax to fly.  So wrestlers?  Yeah.  Why is that?  So I could never be a wrestler.  Drugtasting.  Yeah, or any other pills, apparently.  But why is it wrong if you have anxiety?  That's what I'm saying.  Some of them went to Abu Dhabi today.  Because if you're a wrestler, you shouldn't have anxiety.  Maybe that's it.  Well, no, but flying.  Everyone has anxiety flying.  I don't.  You pop some Xanis when you have flying?  I pop many Xanis and lots of wine. 
[02:25:00]  I like to be as close to not being able to walk around.  I heard that's dangerous.  Yeah, you're taking the fucking William Holden approach.  It's the only way, guys.  You haven't seen her Xanax Q&As on Twitter?  Oh, yeah.  I do see any questions when I'm at the airport an hour before the flight.  I'll answer anything for an hour.  Yes, he was large.  Girthy.  Girthy is so gross.  Ew.  How did you just show me that?  It's not me.  It's my move.  Girthy.  I'm so camel toe in his jeans.  But it's an actual camel's toe in my jeans. 
[02:25:30]  Is Girthy gross if it's proportional to length?  Yeah, because otherwise it's what?  Chody?  Yeah, it's like a salmon can.  Yeah.  Like a squash coke can.  Do you prefer length over girth?  No, you shouldn't.  No, I don't think you should.  What, do you want a fucking pipe cleaner in there?  I think it just needs to be nice.  Proportion.  Proportion.  Nothing too extreme on either end.  Like, mine starts.  You know what?  Mine tapers off like a pyramid.  Yeah.  It tapers off very quickly.  Wait, it tapers off or it goes like into the head?  You got a torpedo cock? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  The head is wide and then it gets really thin at the bottom.  Oh, that's really odd.  So my dick won't stand up straight.  It just flops on my violin.  If you're a dick with a cigar, it'd be a Salamone.  He's got a dick like a child with water on the brain.  Swings around.  My dick just got on a spaceship.  He's got go-down syndrome.  You don't want it like a pencil.  No.  But then you don't want it like one of those things that go, meh.  Yeah.  No.  It has to be just...  I hate to use the word average because who wants average? 
[02:26:30]  I'm average actually, but a little wider than average.  Bragging again.  No one ever asks women if they have an average pussy.  My skills are above average.  Thank you.  Do you have an average?  Do you have a shallow uterus?  No, I don't care about the depth.  I don't care if it's like a change press.  I'm not hitting bottom.  I just like to know what it looks like.  I don't like when there's too much meat involved on the outside.  He loves like...  You like that?  A nice big corned beef sandwich on the outside.  Oh, God.  Sometimes you've got to fiddle until you get to the...  Where the fuck did your hole go?  Wait, where are these vaginas? 
[02:27:00]  These sound horrible.  Oh, these are these.  Oh, it looks like an explosion at the Steak'em factory.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  It looks like a gargoyle sighing.  Sausages.  Yeah.  Love that.  Oh, Jesus.  All big and fat.  What?  Let's your fucking Baltazar and Pebbles play this.  Right?  What did we...  Oh, you used to say it looked like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  Yeah.  That's very disgusting.  A lot of meat.  That's a really interesting visual.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At the end of the day, I don't... 
[02:27:30]  And this is...  I don't find either of the genitalia all that attractive on their own.  Well, you know what?  Men or women?  No, I just think they...  You're not into severed genitalia.  Right.  Okay.  I just think I like everyone better with either undies on or...  I think that's hard.  When you're all wound up, though, in the heat of passion, all of a sudden, that shit's a work of art.  That vagina.  Mm-hmm.  That's like, wow.  I can't wait to get my face all over there.  Yeah, I'm with you.  I'm with you.  I'm what they call a pussy-eating fool.  Yes.  Tailbone to belly button.  A fool, I tell you. 
[02:28:00]  A fool.  All in between.  But you think it's pretty, or you're just in the moment?  I am in the moment.  I think it's pretty.  I'm fucking...  I'm all about the undercarriage wash.  You know?  Just wash the undercarriage.  Like, at the car wash, you pay extra for that.  It doesn't have to be pretty.  Like, I've never looked at a steak or a salad and thought that's pretty.  What?  I just think that looks amazing.  Like, that looks great.  That's going to be terrific.  Yes.  If you don't look at a steak, if you look at it literally, it's just a fucking cow thigh  or whatever it is.  What?  You don't look at a vagina and think, wow, that's kind of... 
[02:28:30]  Exactly.  Like, I can't see that.  I've seen quite a few that just made me go, God damn it.  Yeah, I have too.  Have you gotten all the way to that point and you're like, whoops, that's not going to happen?  No.  Does it look right?  Or there's other reasons, sure.  Yeah, there's other times where they have a chubby, a chunt, a chubby cunt.  I'm not a big fan of the chunt.  That's not real.  Oh, is that a great?  That's a great word.  You're a chubby cunt.  Sam.  Look at Carrot Top.  What?  That's some poor woman. 
[02:29:00]  That's Sam.  How are you?  That's two places.  That's a woman.  That looks exactly like Carrot Top.  It looks like Carrot Top.  Or Sean White.  Jimmy, if he was...  Wait, is that the fucking...  That's amazing.  Wow.  What a head of hair she has.  Is that his name?  What?  Sean White, that fucking red-headed lady.  Yeah.  That's a woman, though.  But he cut off all his hair now because he's elegant.  Is that what he is?  He's GQ'd up.  He doesn't want to be a fucking crazy character.  I didn't mean nothing.  Oh, you're saying that?  Okay, nice.  Just me.  I'm awesome.  Where were we?  Oh, chunt. 
[02:29:30]  Chunt.  Speaking of chunts...  We're going to have to meet you guys.  Good to have you.  Yeah, thanks.  On that segue...  Sam's saying nothing.  I've never seen you quiet.  You don't like this talk.  Well, this is the real show.  This is the big boy show.  See, he does...  It's the equivalent of the Thanksgiving dinner, the kids' table.  That is the after show.  This is where the adults have some wine.  When they talk about things like business and important things. 
[02:30:00]  And then the kids have the Kool-Aid and the drumstick and the wishbone.  And they're all yelling and too loud and saying stupid things.  The kids' table's better than the big boy table.  I agree.  Sure it is.  Yeah.  No, sometimes it is.  Underneath.  There's a darn drumstick, boy.  Yeah, make a wish.  Sure, you tugged that.  Make a wish.  When there are guests in the studio, sometimes the boys show off more than they do if there  are no guests in the studio.  And my beatings become significantly worse. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Are you saying we can't get Paul McCartney?  What did you say there?  I love knowing that there's battles between everyone.  Oh, it's crazy.  Everywhere.  The radio business is just...  And it's the men.  Man, you guys are cattier than...  Seriously.  Like on a sports line.  We got a little cattie.  Yeah, you're very involved with...  Do you have brothers growing up?  Are you old?  I have one.  One?  He's younger.  Oh, you had sex with a black man?  Have I?  Oh, he said you had brothers.  Oh, I thought...  Oh, okay. 
[02:31:00]  How about a brown man?  How about a brown man?  I have a brother.  How about a happy medium?  Yeah, no, I...  Yeah.  Can I tell you why I love Michelle?  I'm a little bit country and I'm a little bit rock and roll.  Nice.  The answer was, hmm...  Yeah.  That's why I love Michelle Beale.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I just want to clear some shit up real nice, Michelle.  Smell me first.  Smell me first.  Yeah.  You smell good.  What is that cologne?  I smelled it last night.  Kenzo.  I wear Kenzo.  Very nice.  You're so fancy.  Yeah.  Russell makes more than all of us put together.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  It's depressing.  I...  You know, I'm trying to beat all the stereotypes. 
[02:31:30]  I don't ever want to smell.  You know?  Just keep fucking, yeah, shower like eight times a day.  I do.  Like cologne.  I literally three times a day.  I'm a three times a day shower.  What?  Yeah.  No, you're not.  It is, yeah.  How do you have time to shower three times a day?  You just do.  That's weird.  If I poo, it's got to be showered after.  Just get a bidet.  I do have a shower.  Well, then why do you need a shower?  I know, but when I'm on the road, you gotta...  I just pull the drain cover off and I squat right over.  Have you ever done that?  Have I ever not?  Because you didn't know it was a poo coming.  Yeah.  I look like the reverse angle of a fucking snake charmer. 
[02:32:00]  I'm sending him back down.  A dyslexic snake charmer.  That's fucking disgusting.  I know, but it's your own shower.  And then he's mushing it down with his heel.  Yes.  So through the drain, it looks like one of those Play-Doh fun factories making a star out of shit.  So at a point, one end is in the drain, but the other end is not out of your ass.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  And everything is connected.  No, they're not usually solid poops when this happens.  For me, usually.  Really?  Why would you just solid poop in the shower? 
[02:32:30]  There's very few things I'm good at, but I will say that my stool production is exemplary.  Yeah.  I know, but...  You're the log father.  Very healthy.  I feel badly at Michelle's when we're talking about this childish stuff.  Actually, poop's my favorite thing to talk about.  Is it really?  Yeah, I got kind of like a little female boner when we started talking about poop.  Oh, wow.  Are you into the pooper?  Do you like that?  I like to talk about poop.  I'm not always regular.  I think that's why I like to talk about it.  Oh, no.  Oh, why are you not regular?  I don't know.  Women, I think they fight that shit all the time.  Yeah.  They do.  Yeah?  Which way is it? 
[02:33:00]  Is it a little too soft, a little too rough?  A little too soft at times.  Oh, wow.  Have a banana.  A little potassium for you.  A little potassium for you.  A little potassium for you, maybe?  Yeah, the potassium will firm that up.  Yeah, there's something you're probably eating in your diet.  A banana, but you just shove it up your ass.  You know what?  Take it.  Take it.  That doesn't make it solid, though, right?  No, it makes it regular.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't mess with this stuff.  I take a little Citrusel.  I think it's called.  God, we're old.  I know.  Are we already taking Citrusel?  I just know.  Hey, you know Rogan wants me to try that Metamucil shit. 
[02:33:30]  Nah, you don't want to get hooked.  It actually will work.  It cleans you out.  A couple times you take it, but then you don't get crazy on it.  I Metamucil wants the Mucils.  I hate them.  You're fucking hilarious.  I'll tell you what makes you shit.  And he goes, now, as if we transition.  Yes, of course.  Yes, of course.  I'm almost being like, I don't engage in that type of humor.  Now, back to the conversation.  I never met a musician.  Yeah, but I'm not exactly segwaying into an important discussion. 
[02:34:00]  I was going to tell you, vegetable juice.  I literally go to the gym.  Like V8?  No, no, no.  I go to the gym, and I'll do my thing, and at the end, I'll have some chicken.  And a giant beet, carrot, celery, real vegetable juice.  And I'm telling you, I live five blocks from the gym, and I'm stiff-legging down my own hallway.  I thought you meant Terry Schiavo's piss.  Vegetable juice.  Did you just make a Schiavo joke at all?  What is happening?  I was going to say Karen Ann Quinlan, but that's really coming back.

You've done it!  You've reached the top.  Of the worst of the week countdown, I've been here with you all the way.  Sam Roberts.  If you missed any of it, the countdown replays throughout the weekend.  It's on demand.  You can hear it.  Okay?  Or you can just listen to the show live every weekday morning at 6 a.m.  You can also listen to my show Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[02:39:30]  It's the Sam Roberts show.  And it's going to be a good one this week.  Let's get to the number one bit.  E-Rock was on vacation week before last.  He gave out his cell phone number.  He didn't give it out.  His cell phone number was given out on the air by one Greg Opie Hughes.  He came back from vacation, and he let Opie know exactly how he can repay him for his actions.  E-Rock, back on the air, after his cell phone number was given to the public. 
[02:40:00]  Number one on this here countdown.  Number one.  I got notice from other people that were listening to the show at that point and told me that this was going on.  Oh my God.  So I went, I was livid.  I turned on my phone and just had enough time to send Opie a text before my phone decided to no longer work. 
[02:40:30]  What do you mean?  You know the little green icon that has the thought bubble for messages?  Yeah.  And you know it would have a little red number up at the top telling you how many you have?  Sure.  Picture it going from under 10 to 99999.  Right?  Wow.  And then a message popping up at the same time saying, your voicemail is full.  I can't access the audio portion that's on my phone. 
[02:41:00]  Oh boy.  And then I didn't even know about this.  It's MMS messaging, which I guess is for pictures.  A lot of plates of food.  Cockpicks.  And then somebody had sent me the entire history of the development.  I could have just said both food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then somebody sent me the history of the development of the hot dog.  And then some weird cymbal showed up on the phone where it would not function at all. 
[02:41:30]  It had to be completely reset.  Did you try putting it on airplane mode?  You just couldn't?  I couldn't get to it.  By the time I got back.  The whole phone was jammed up.  As soon as I turned it on, sent out the text to him, everything hit all at once because the phone was off.  Well, did you reboot?  Like, did you try the hard reboot?  I was trying.  It wasn't doing it.  I had to do it plugged in to the computer when I got back to, you know, got back home.  And as soon as that worked, I flipped it onto airplane mode and do not disturb so I could back up the stuff. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  And then the phone was completely useless.  Did you know that somebody had really mucked up the works?  Yes.  I flattered that I was the last text message from your phone.  Wow.  There was also a lot of...  A lot of...  No other comments, just U-C-T and a bunch of S's across the text.  It's chipping.  That's great.  I don't think it would be out of line to ask for just a little apology. 
[02:42:30]  From you?  Yes.  What?  Why are you laughing?  Why would E-Rock have to...  I apologize many times.  Apologize.  So I'm sorry.  On the phone, in text messages, through other people.  Just a little apology.  Because you really thought I would do something like that on purpose.  I think that's fair.  No.  What?  No.  But we're all in agreement that was a horrible mistake, but you assumed I did it on purpose. 
[02:43:00]  And I think we have such a friendship that that...  I think a slight...  Like, look, a little apology.  A little apology?  No, because when...  Just something like, I'm really sorry that I really thought you did it on purpose.  That's all.  Because when other people who aren't on the air here are getting texts saying, Greg just  gave out your phone number.  Oh.  And my wife goes...  Wow, he's using my real name.  Of course he did.  Shit just got real. 
[02:43:30]  Shit.  No Q102 in this shit.  Were you mad?  Oh, I was furious.  Oh, man.  And when the phone bricked up and it was just completely...  I'm like, I wanted to throw it against the wall.  Yeah.  So I just dropped the phone.  I was screaming.  And then...  What did your wife say at that point?  Because you...  Oh, she just kept saying, of course he did this.  Oh, wow.  But...  Damn.  But, in all fairness, because, you know, I'm not looking too good here. 
[02:44:00]  Again, this is prior to finding out it's a mistake.  Like, in all fairness, our relationship is such that you should know that I would have  never done that.  No, but it happened.  Yeah, I know.  I've taken complete responsibility for that.  So, immediately, your first reaction to it is, oh, maybe this was a mistake.  Oh, I understand why you would think that, but I'm just thinking a little apology now  that you know what really went on.  Oh, wow.  Not happening.  Ouch.  And then, getting updates with such comments of, a lot of Space Mountain, Tower of Tiramisu. 
[02:44:30]  We said that stuff.  I was just...  See, we're going through the...  With quotes and a dash saying, Anthony or Jimmy.  Just going through some of the rides there at Disney.  Did you hear the whole show, Friday?  I heard...  Most of it?  I heard up until you jock-tobered Scott and Todd.  Okay, so go around the road.  Good one.  I think you focused enough on me.  Uh-oh.  I want to see what you think of the other guys. 
[02:45:00]  It's only fair.  Okay.  Because everyone had a part in this.  Yes.  I had the biggest part.  I had the biggest piece of pie.  You had a doozy.  How did we all have a part in it?  You guys pushed it forward.  You said, oh, you know, I hope they're not sending cockpicks.  I made it.  I was worried about you.  We think how many cockpicks you would have gotten if you didn't say that.  It just occurred to me that I hope that you don't have to see that on your vacation.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  You go on some of the cheesy Disney rides. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  You know, the fairy ones.  Yay.  The small world.  Go on the little carousel.  Go on the Dumbo fucking things.  Yay.  Up.  Up.  Down.  Up.  Down.  That's it.  Up.  Down.  Okay.  That's not what he was getting at.  No, no.  I swear.  The Dumbo ride.  It is the Dumbo ride.  It's the same thing as the fucking space one in Tomorrowland.  I have to pay extra for the Halloween passes.  I hope so.  It doesn't count with your park copper pass.  It's a special treat.  And you did that.  So we got the Halloween pass.  Oh.  They didn't skip that.  Treated yourself. 
[02:46:00]  Did you?  Treated yourself.  You got cheap tickets to fly down there, though, right?  We'll get to that.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And the best part about this time of year is that there's a lot of people, but not enough  to crowd everything.  Uh-huh.  So you're getting into every ride within five minutes.  Wow.  Good choice.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Space Mountain multiple times.  No line.  That's great.  It's great.  So the Halloween passes.  Then, on Thursday, we decided, you know what? 
[02:46:30]  Maybe we should change it up a little bit.  Sure.  And decided to go to Universal Studios and Island of Adventure.  Oh.  What?  Wait, what?  A whole nother park.  Dude, put it this way.  Everything they got at Disney has no value at Universal.  Nope.  At least they'll get my little apology out of this.  We did almost every park but the water parks for Disney.  So that's four parks.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Outside of the water parks. 
[02:47:00]  So then we had the two park passes for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.  Oh, my God.  And then...  That's going to...  Then a dinner at one of the fancy hotels that are at the Universal property.  The Portofino Hotel.  Oh, you ate at the Portofino Hotel.  Oh, that sounds fancy.  It is.  No all-inclusive shit there.  That's all cash on the barrel head right there.  The Italian restaurant is amazing. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, boy.  What did you have?  I had...  Well, they did not have the lasagna.  We'll have the linguine and white clam sauce and a Coke with no ice.  They had a traditional sundae sauce with spaghetti and meatballs that had beef and pork and all that.  Oh, my God.  The wine was mixed into it.  Did you indulge?  A little wine?  Oh, I ate it.  Sugar.  Oh, my God.  So that was fun.  And then, you know, cab to and from the park back to Disney. 
[02:48:00]  Absolutely.  How far was the park?  Maybe 20 minutes.  That's a cab ride.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's...  And this was spur of the moment, so it's not like you could find a deal on park passes.  No, you had to go, and it was just two adults.  Just splurged.  Just splurged.  And what airline did you take?  We'll get to that.  Whoa.  Oh, also at Epcot was the food, international food and wine festival. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, no, that's right.  How lucky.  Right.  Oh, my God.  30 exhibits as you go around the world.  You go around the world from, I believe, Canada to Mexico and everything in between.  Yep.  And, wow.  Yeah, and that isn't included.  No.  No, I wouldn't be.  Because they open up exhibits for countries that aren't featured at Epcot.  Oh, they do.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, of course, you have your little bracelet and your little food passport that they give 
[02:49:00]  you, and you go eating and drinking around the world.  Around the world.  Well, did you treat yourself to that?  Oh, yes.  Let's try Germany.  It was a two-day ordeal.  Oh, look, France.  We're in France.  Let's try some French wine.  It took a two-day ordeal.  It took a two-day ordeal.  Oh, my God.  Two-day ordeal.  Two days.  Not a fan of the ouzo from Greece.  Oh, ouzo's terrible.  At least you tried it.  Black licorice liqueur.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Terrible.  Not pleasurable.  I'm happy for you.  Oh, some French wines must have been nice. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  There was a lot of different types of sangria.  Ah.  Argentina and Chile and Mexico.  And the Italy, of course.  Italy.  Probably a nice...  They had some nice food exhibits, some nice wine.  Oh.  And then, you know, right next to Italy is Morocco, which had great wine.  Going into France, which had great wine.  Of course.  And you have to stop everywhere.  And you're paying for each time you get something.  Yeah.  And then, you know, they have a little concert. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  They have a concert there that you don't know what band's playing.  Sure.  But you're kind of hammered, so you need to maybe take a little break.  Yeah.  Sat down and watched the Go-Go's.  The Go-Go's were there.  The Go-Go's were playing.  The actual Go-Go's.  All right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Doing both Go-Go's and Belinda Carlisle songs.  Of course.  Yeah.  Did she do Heaven is a Place on Earth?  No, that's the one they didn't do.  What?  We got the beat?  Yes.  We got the beat.  Vacation?  Vacation.  All the hits.  It was great.  Our lips are sealed? 
[02:50:30]  Yes.  Ha ha!  Right!  Oh.  Why would you just...  Jeez.  You get it, because when you eat and...  Oh, God.  You know what he's getting at.  You know what he's getting at.  Because no one's paying attention.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And then the next day, because they switched up the bands every three days.  Sure, why would they?  For a special vacation.  But we were at the end of the Go-Go's run.  Uh-huh.  The next day, it was Air Supply.  And who wants to sit there?  Oh, no.  Air Supply.  No.  No. 
[02:51:00]  So you go back and continue eating and drinking  until you somehow make it back to your hotel.  Wow.  So that was fun.  And, you know, of course, shopping and other little extras.  You go to downtown Disney?  Oh, we did.  Now, what did you do there?  There's some shows.  There's a lot of shopping.  A lot of shopping.  Yeah, restaurants.  A lot of shopping, a lot of exclusive stuff.  Did you eat at the Rainforest Cafe?  No, that seemed a little tacky. 
[02:51:30]  That's just so maul and cheesy.  But I watched the volcano that erupts.  Of course, yes.  So I watched that.  Oh, I remember that.  But then there was a specialty toy store that they had there  where you get to build your own things.  Oh, was this the Lego store?  No, there was the Lego store near there.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  But, no, this was all Disney stuff where you could build droids.  Oh!  Lightsabers.  Okay, so because Disney now owns Star Wars, a lot of that merchandising. 
[02:52:00]  Did you go there?  Yeah, I did.  Did you pick up some gifts for yourself?  No, I didn't buy...  I bought for some other people, but I didn't buy any of the Star Wars stuff from there.  Did you build anything?  No, not from there.  Oh, man.  That's too bad.  Not from there.  From where?  Where I bought stuff?  Where'd you build stuff from?  Oh, no, I didn't build stuff or anything for myself.  I bought stuff from other places.  I spent a lot of money when I was at Universal at the new Springfield, USA section of the park. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, Simpsons Land.  Yes, Springfield.  So you bought some things.  A lot of things.  Picked up a few things.  Treated yourself.  A lot of things.  Wow.  If you want to...  This just sounds...  This just sounds crazy.  It was amazing attention to detail that they did in that park.  Sure.  Good, good.  What are we getting at here?  Oh, boy.  Well, you must have been happy when you got the news, when you heard the audio.  Wow.  Look, it's like you're in Springfield. 
[02:53:00]  This is terrific.  It looks stupid.  It looks stupid.  It gives a fuck.  It looks pricey.  Oh, man.  It's got Moe's.  Krusty Burger's there.  Krusty Burger, Quickie Mart.  And I'll bet Krusty Burger isn't exactly fast food prices.  No.  A lot of...  It is quite pricey.  Did you eat a Krusty Burger?  Yes, and then...  Did you have a drink at Moe's?  I had a Flaming Moe at Moe's.  You had a Flaming Moe.  And I had...  You know what the secret ingredient is, right? 
[02:53:30]  I had a duff.  You have to have a duff.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's cough syrup.  Was Moe behind the bar?  No.  There were other people there.  Where was Moe?  I don't know.  Moe wasn't there.  Are there any Simpsons people walking around?  Yeah.  I've got a couple of photos with some characters.  Okay.  Then they had Lard Lad Donuts.  Ah, yeah.  Did you get yourself a snack?  I did.  You're good.  Or two.  Is it not that long? 
[02:54:00]  Three.  Four.  I don't know.  Five.  Oh, maybe Immobilize.  Six.  Seven.  Oh.  Well, I've got to tell you.  It's another Eric Nagel?  No, that's me.  Oh, you weren't...  You defriended me and then refriended me?  Yeah.  You just defriended me, then.  When did you defriend me?  Who knows?  Probably Friday.  He had enough.  And then he refriended me.  Thank you for refriending me.  Are we unfriended, too, Eric?  Oh, the big Springfield...  No, I like the Jim Norton page. 
[02:54:30]  Thank you.  Look at that.  Very nice.  Jabba Diah Springfield.  Jabba Diah Springfield statue.  They went all out on the Simpsons world, which means they must charge quite a bit once  you're in there.  Yeah.  Things are not...  See that donut there?  Wow, yeah.  It's this big.  Oh, man.  He's making...  That's probably like eight inches long, nine inches long.  Did you eat it?  I had a couple of bites.  It's too sweet, but...  Oh, man.  Not a few.  Duck Gardens.  Yeah.  Wow.  God, that's crazy.  I would do nothing here.  Surly?  You'd do nothing?  No, it's just not my world, you know? 
[02:55:00]  Oh, my God.  They got the Android's dungeon and baseball card show.  Yeah.  Right.  Where the comic book guy works.  Yeah.  Did you go in there?  No, it's a facade.  Oh, they got some false fronts.  They got some false fronts there.  Well, that was the only one.  Everything else is a store.  It's just a stupid cartoon.  But it's still in characters.  It says, sorry, we're closed for Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con.  Right.  Which is the Bi-Mon's science fiction convention.  Really funny.  Let's get him through a show with some...  Quickie Mart.  Wow.  Or you can get a Squishy.  Squishy.  Did you? 
[02:55:30]  No, I didn't get Squishy.  Look at this.  I was drinking a lot.  You can get Buzz Cola.  Did you walk around with a solid Buzz for most of the trip?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very, very...  Fucking zooted.  Look at the details here.  Do not accept checks from...  Chief Wiggum, Reverend Lovejoy, Homer J. Simpson, Homer S. Simpson, H.J. Simpson,  Homor Simpson...  Wow.  ...or Homer J. Fong.  I love it.  A lot of inside jokes.  Yes.  They ran out of Bort name tags. 
[02:56:00]  Another inside joke.  I like it.  But anyway, so, yeah, I went through Springfield, went through all this stuff.  There was shopping and extras.  Extras?  That could be accounted for.  Did you buy any clothing at the Simpsons World?  Oh, I did.  You did?  You'll see a lot of shirts starting to circulate soon.  Okay, all right.  Putting them into rotation.  Ah, the Frying Dutchman.  Yes.  Seafood.  Wonderful.  So there was that.  Then the flights that you had asked about.  Yes, what airline?  We flew United. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, okay.  Very nice.  Did you use miles?  We did.  Oh.  Nice.  First class?  No, not first class.  But whatever that new section is that they have right outside of first class.  Business?  Oh.  Economy Plus?  I guess, or whatever.  Because we were right by the curtain to...  Okay, that's Economy Plus.  A little more leg room?  Yep.  So you used miles to fly, so the flight didn't cause anything?  No, it did.  It used some miles, but it didn't cover everything.  Okay.  Just miles to upgrade to Economy Plus. 
[02:57:00]  So there's round trips for that.  And then, of course, you know, you have some baggage fees because of the limits that they put on the bag.  50 pounds.  Right.  And, you know, when you're doing that much shopping, you're going to have to pay it.  That sounds...  And then airport parking, when you get back...  Oh, right.  That's not free.  All right, we get it.  Airport parking's a lot.  It sure is.  You treated yourself.  We get it.  Money well spent. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, so there's a nice subtotal here for that.  And then the expenses for the phone.  Okay.  Right.  Which...  I don't remember that being part of the deal.  I was helped with that to get the quote.  I don't remember that being part of the deal.  Does anyone remember that being part of the deal?  The phone?  I do.  Yeah.  I do remember hearing that.  I do remember that.  No, that was Sam trying to push your phone.  Oh, yeah, I brought it up, and it seems right.  Yeah.  Sam and Roland were very helpful with that.  What do you mean?  I didn't agree to that.  You did.  You said you would cover the phone. 
[02:58:00]  And then Jim had said, you know, because it was going to take a year, so people who had  the old number would, you know, I could keep in contact with.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So, would you like the bill?  Well, I guess all this boils down to a total of some way, shape, or form.  Obviously, I fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  It was a horrible mistake.  I openly admit that.  Hold on.  And I'm taking full responsibility.  That's why I said I would pay for this shit. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  And, uh...  Flight, hotel, vacation expenses, and the brand new phone.  The grand total comes, too.  That's the best we got from last week.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.  The Opie and Anthony Worst of the Week countdown is available whenever you want to hit.  Go to SiriusXM.com.  I'll have the man for details.

Fuck yeah.  This is Friends of the Show. 
[03:03:00]  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony  Show.  This is Jim Florentine's podcast, Honey Metal Visions.  You know, if you guys don't like iTunes and don't use iTunes, a lot of people hate Apple  products, which I get because, you know, the new iPhone's out and, you know, came in different  colors, so people are waiting on line for fucking three days for that.  And then, now you can use your fingerprints as a, you know, an ID.  Ooh. 
[03:03:30]  Ooh, that's crazy.  So instead of punching in four numbers for your password, you just put your finger up.  Isn't that, wow.  That's going to really make me go wait online for fucking six hours.  So I can put my finger there instead of typing four letters, my password really quick.  It's about the same time.  I don't need to change phones for that.  I'm not impressed.  The government has enough of our information that we really need them.  Apple to have our fucking fingerprints now. 
[03:04:00]  I'd rather put in my own code.  I'm sure the NSA knows my code anyway, obviously.  But I'd still rather do it that way.  I don't need that for...  Yeah, it's going to be faster.  No, it's not.  Stop.  You're fucking lying.  I don't like the upgrade on it, the I-07 or whatever the shit is.  It looks very generic.  I had to hit that button and upgrade.  So I'm fucking sick of Apple, too.  People leave me a lot of messages.  There was a little kink in the fucking thing going on where I couldn't listen to all the messages. 
[03:04:30]  It was taking me a while, but they're working that out.  But a lot of people leave me messages, good podcast ideas or rants about different shit.  So if you have an iPhone, go to ButterflyRadio.com, download the app, and you can leave me messages,  and I return the messages back.  So that's how that shit works.  Keep the ideas coming with the podcast, because you guys are always funny.  A lot of people ask me to do a podcast on twerking. 
[03:05:00]  I'm working on it.  It might take a while, because I don't know if I have an hour of material on that.  I probably could.  I need to watch a little more.  I only heard of the thing fucking like a month ago, so I will definitely work on that one.  And there's some others down the road, but, yeah, the twerking one really gets to me and annoys me.  But hopefully, you know, that's a thing like the Harlem Shuffle or whatever the fuck that stupid thing was.  In three months, nobody's going to be talking about that anymore.  It's just silly. 
[03:05:30]  So what are you going to do?  Some guy was telling me shit.  I can't remember his name, but his coworker, she's 63 years old, and he turned her on to my podcast, and she loves it.  And I'm like, that's fucking awesome, and she's very conservative, and she listens at work.  And one of her favorite podcasts is when I interviewed that girl at, like, Smelly Balls.  That was an early podcast, probably, I don't know, even two years ago or so.  But, yeah, I found a girl that loved a guy's smelly balls and smelling them. 
[03:06:00]  And a 63-year-old woman found that fascinating.  I love that.  That's beautiful.  I found my audience.  So thank you.  And please pass that along to your friends.  You don't hear too much fucking honest shit anywhere anymore.  You know, it's all middle-of-the-road drone shit.  And, you know, podcasts, you know, a lot of different podcasts out there.  You just, you know, hey, this is how I really feel.  Wow, this is refreshing to hear.  And the older people get it. 
[03:06:30]  I like doing an older crowd.  When I'm doing a comedy club and people go, oh, man, they're young.  They're going to be great.  You know, if they're from, like, 20 or 18 to about 26, they're going to be, most of the time, they're going to be terrible.  Because they're still politically correct.  They still think they're going to change the world.  They find every joke mean.  You get a crowd, like, 30 to 60, 35, 60, whatever, they've lived life.  They understand.  They just want to go out and have a few beers.  Have a few laughs.  They've got a lot of fucking stress in their life. 
[03:07:00]  And they just want to unwind.  They're a way better crowd than a younger crowd.  You crack a joke about the homeless and a younger crowd.  That's terrible.  You're making fun of them.  You don't know what's wrong with them.  They're living on the street.  Really?  Oh, I didn't know that.  Bunch of fucking babies.  That's why I don't do any colleges.  They're all fucking crybabies.  Oh, you're so mean.  Oh, I can't believe he said that.  So, that's why a lot of comics are doing podcasts instead.  Just go, you know what?  Fuck you.  You're going to cry. 
[03:07:30]  You're going to come to a comedy club and judge jokes.  And be like, that's, oh, my God.  Then, we'll just do it here.  And you people appreciate it.  Put it on your phone.  You're fucking listening.  Go into work.  Go, man, I just, I dread going into work.  But I need to hear something that's going to cheer me up.  Something that's angry and hateful.  And that's what this podcast is about.  It's another football one.  But before we start in with the football, I know, look.  You know, last week I did the whole podcast on the football names, every name being offensive. 
[03:08:00]  People really dug that one.  It was one of my most popular podcasts.  It's just so silly and ridiculous.  But, you know, like that's what we're coming to with the NFL is how, you know, like I was saying before,  how politically correct everything is going to be and going that way where, you know,  the commissioner of the league, you know, does an interview and says if one person's offended by a team named the NFL, 
[03:08:30]  then we need to listen.  He doesn't have jurisdiction over the owner, Daniel Snyder of the Redskins, to change that name.  Because the owners hire Goodell, the commissioner.  So he works for them.  So he can, you know, fucking lobby the other NFL owners to, you know, talk to Daniel Snyder.  Say, come on, man, we've got to change that name.  But ultimately he has no power there, which I love because that fucking guy loves power.  And just destroying everything about the league. 
[03:09:00]  You know what I mean?  And so if they have to change the Redskins, you know, my friend Nick Papalo made a good point.  He said the Redskins, what the Redskins mean, it doesn't mean, it's not a thing about their skin that they have red skin.  It was more they put like red war paint on before they went to war on their face,  like streaked it two fingers on each side.  And that's what they call Redskins.  And that's so it's not even about, you know, about their skin color.  Even if it is, is that really offensive, Redskins? 
[03:09:30]  Like if there was a team that came out called the Whiteskins would, and it'd be like, hey, man, that's you fucking talking about my color.  That's, that's, you know, I don't know.  I don't get it.  Look, if maybe, you know, the American Indians are offended, but whatever.  But Redskins putting paint on your face before you go to fucking war is to me is not offensive.  But, you know, the PC people out there, you know, starting this fucking shit, getting this thing going. 
[03:10:00]  And the commissioner, of course, just being a bunch, just being a pussy.  And just saying, look, man, the name's been around since 1932.  And, you know, sorry, you know, I'm not getting involved in that.  That's all you got to say.  Someone, just someone have a set of balls.  To just say, I'm sorry, we're not getting involved in that. 
[03:10:30]  There's not this big thing.  There's not millions of people, hundreds of thousands of people offended by the Redskins name.  Like I said before, you know, you know, like I said last week, Giants versus Titans playing.  You have midget friends.  That's going to be offensive to them.  Why do I have to call them the Giants?  Why do I have to call them the Titans?  Why don't they call them the New York Little People?  Why don't they call them the Tennessee Dwarfs?  That's where we're going to go with this slippery slope. 
[03:11:00]  Look, that's the same thing with the fucking guns.  Everybody says if you try to take one gun away, the AR-15 or whatever, the one that, you know, does all the mass shootings and shit.  Then they're going to go after this gun.  They go after this one.  They go after this one.  And then we're going to have no guns.  So that's the theory there behind it.  You start with one.  So that's why there's been no laws passed at all.  And there never will be because of that.  So then you start going to apply the same to the football.  You take that Redskins name away.  Then they go after the rest of the names. 
[03:11:30]  But now what's going on, it's a whole other level of just nonsense in the NFL.  Okay, when I record this podcast, only two weeks of the NFL have been played.  Two weekends.  In the two weeks, which is what, 16 games.  So 32 games have been played so far in two weeks.  And three games have gotten stopped in the middle of it or delayed because of the weather. 
[03:12:00]  Because of the weather.  Three.  In the first two weeks.  I've never seen this happen before.  This is what happens when you've got a former lawyer running the league.  Roger Goodell used to be a friggin' high-powered lawyer in Washington.  This is what happens when you've got a lawyer running the league where there's a fucking lightning storm. 
[03:12:30]  They go, we better wait for kickoff or stop the game halfway through the first quarter for an hour.  Because they looked at the Doppler radar and it looks like it's going to be around for another 45 minutes.  Stop with your fucking Doppler radar.  That fucking shit means nothing.  It's always wrong.  Always.  Anyone that follows that fucking shit, just think of your friend that's a big weather person.  That always talks about the weather because they've got nothing else to talk about.  Because when you talk about the weather, that means you really have nothing to say. 
[03:13:00]  90% of the time, you're just making small talk.  Look, everyone has that friend, you know, there's a storm coming later today.  Oh, really?  There is?  You didn't hear about it?  No.  That is huge.  Big thunderstorms coming early evening.  It's supposed to be really bad.  Yeah, I looked at the weather, man.  They fucking put out their smartphone.  Look at this.  You see the red or the green or whatever the fuck that shit is on there?  You see that? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, about 4.30, between 4.30 and 6, it's coming right through our area.  Yeah, so what?  I can't believe you haven't heard about it.  I go, no, I haven't.  It's weird.  I haven't.  No.  It's weird because I've been out all day.  I went to the bank.  I went to the post office.  I was in the supermarket.  Those are plenty of places where people make small talk and talk about the weather.  And nobody said anything.  Nobody even brought it up.  Yeah, well, I'm telling you.  I go, okay, so even if there is going to be thunderstorms between 4.30 and 6, we don't 
[03:14:00]  live in a fucking fort in the woods.  We don't live in a tree fort.  Okay, we got a house.  We got a roof.  We're going to be okay.  If I have to go outside, I got an umbrella.  Isn't that weird?  I can actually use an umbrella.  Or I can just go out without an umbrella and get a little wet like I do in the shower every  day.  Or, hey, if I have to go in my car, if I have to, you know, because there's an emergency, 
[03:14:30]  I got windshield wipers too.  And I got tires that are pretty good that I'm not going to fucking slide all over the  road.  So why are you panicking about thunderstorms between 4.30 and 6 when we're going to be okay?  That's the weather person.  Nobody, stop with your fucking, you're in a supermarket guy in front of you. 
[03:15:00]  Can you believe it's fall already?  Yeah, I can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's September fucking 20th.  Or 21st.  Yeah, of course.  That's when the fall starts.  Why?  Has it started before in July that I don't know about?  Of course I can believe it.  It's fucking September.  It's week three of football.  Why wouldn't it be the fall?  It just seems like it went so fast.  No, it doesn't.  Not to me.  It's just weird.  I can't believe it. 
[03:15:30]  Halloween's coming up already.  Yeah, Halloween comes up every year on October 31st.  Fucking Doppler.  I got Doppler.  The Doppler radar.  I got a storm coming.  Look at the Doppler radar.  That's what they show on the NFL games.  I don't give a fuck.  You stop the game in the middle of it.  I had momentum.  I was into it.  And now you stop it.  Look, according to Doppler radar, it should be coming through.  Who gives a shit?  Did they stop the games in the 50s, in the 60s, in the 70s because of weather? 
[03:16:00]  I don't ever remember it.  Ever.  The snow.  What is going on?  Three games.  Seriously, I mean, it's a crazy...  What's next?  What is next?  Okay.  If they're stopping it for rain and lightning because there's lightning in the area, 
[03:16:30]  what is next?  Are they going to...  I mean, what if there's a big windstorm?  What if it's super windy?  I could see the commissioner fucking stopping that game because it's super windy.  You know, we're going to wait for the wind to die down, you know, because, you know,  it's really going to affect the fantasy football stats because, you know, look, the quarterback's  not going to be able to throw. 
[03:17:00]  The receiver's not going to be able to catch it because the wind's so bad and they just  have to hand the ball off the rest of the game.  And if you don't, you know, if you don't, you know, the quarterback is big in fantasy football.  And we're, look, and you know what?  We're all about the fans because that's, you know, the commissioner's big thing.  We're all about the fans.  And we know, you know, we know that fantasy football is a big part of our league and we  want to keep in, you know, in tune with them.  And if we got a game where it's windy and they just have to hand the ball off and they  can't throw it more than two yards and Calvin Johnson can't run for a hundred and it's 
[03:17:30]  going to fuck up your fantasy football stats, that's not fair because we know people have  looked forward to fantasy football every week.  You know, we know that it brings people together on a Sunday fantasy football, you know, the  guys that play fantasy football, you know what it does?  It brings them together for a big circle jerk.  That's what it does.  They all put their fucking laptops to the side, they pull their khakis down and they just start  jerking off. 
[03:18:00]  That's what brings fantasy football fucking fans together on a Sunday.  Oh, look, there's a new, the new Apple iPhone's out.  It's got the old seven, uh, upgrade.  Isn't it cool?  And they all just start jerking off.  It's too windy.  You know what?  Uh, I can picture Al Michaels on a Sunday night, uh, you know, I know you guys just tuned  in, but look, it's, uh, you know, a court came from the commissioner's office, a little 
[03:18:30]  windy tonight here in Chicago.  You know, uh, I don't know why, I don't know why Chicago would be windy, uh, you know, and,  um, we're just going to wait about 45 minutes.  According to Doppler radar, the wind is right now is going to be sick up to 60 miles an hour  within 45 minutes is going to turn, you know, calm down to about 10 or 15.  So we're just going to delay the game a little bit because it's really not fair.  Uh, you know, with the wind hats going to be blowing off and you know, uh, all the shit.  So we're going to just hang out and, and, uh, wait because we know how much people love 
[03:19:00]  fantasy football in the NFL.  And I don't blame Al Michaels, even though he never said that I'm just using him.  I love Al Michaels.  I think he's great.  It's all coming from the commissioner because it's fancy football.  So we don't want to affect the stats.  It's a little windy.  We don't want these guys to get windburned.  I don't want to get sued.  You know, what if these guys sue me, you know, a couple of years from now,  cause they got windburned for playing outside the players.  First of all, they don't stop these games cause they're fans. 
[03:19:30]  They don't give a fuck about the fans.  Every time he says it's all about the fans, he's all, he's full of shit.  Cause if it was all about the fans, you wouldn't charge,  you wouldn't let these teams charge $75 to park.  You wouldn't let them, uh, you wouldn't let them, uh,  have PSLs and stadiums where people have to buy their seat for like $20,000  between a thousand and actually, yeah, 20,000 just to own the seat, 
[03:20:00]  just to own the seat.  And then tell people that it's an investment and it's a good investment to  own a, uh, you know, um, the New York jets in their new stadium.  If you wanted tickets on the 30 yard line, like the old stadium,  when they used to play a giant stadium, it's $20,000 a ticket for your two seats  that your family's had for fucking 30 years, but you own the seat.  So you got to come up with 40,000 right off the bat, but you own it.  I own it for what?  You play fucking 10 games here a year that I could go to. 
[03:20:30]  And it's going to cost me $20,000 and two of the games,  the preseason are shitty that I didn't want to go.  Can I go to a Bon Jovi concert when he plays at the stadium?  Cause I own the seat.  No.  Do I have access to that ticket?  Nope.  Just for football.  I mean, when Springsteen plays there, I can, or a country show.  No, no.  Just for the jet game.  Okay.  So just for 10 times a year, minus two shitty games,  which is eight games and the jets are out of it by week four.  So it's really only fucking two games and I'm paying 20,000. 
[03:21:00]  So, but it is all about the fans.  Cause you really care about us.  And he did say it's a good investment PSLs for people.  Cause I know a lot of people are selling them.  You know, they're going on the black market for like 50,000, those PSLs.  The jets can't get, the jets and giants don't even sell out anymore.  They sold out for fucking 50 years straight.  They can't even sell out anymore because of those PSLs.  So don't say ever it's about the fans and you don't give a fuck about the fans  when there's lightning and when there's rain or whatever's going on, 
[03:21:30]  where you have to stop a game.  You're just worried about the players on the field.  That's all you care about.  Cause you're afraid of getting sued.  Lightning's not hitting the middle of the field that never has.  Football's been playing since what?  19, 20.  I don't know.  Give or take 10 years.  Has there ever lightning hit the fucking field and a player died?  Did Fran Tarkenton in the sixties as he was running around,  scrambling in the back, get hit by lightning and fucking die on the field?  No.  Why are we stopping games all of a sudden? 
[03:22:00]  It's all because a lawyer is running the league and he's fucking afraid of everything.  And he just thinks everybody's going to sue him.  And if something happens during that storm, he is going to get his ass sued.  So it's just better to stop it.  Stop the game.  Just fucking build every stadium, put a roof over every stadium and just get it over with.  Just do that.  The only thing I support, and I always say it every week, is the concussions, the hits  to the head, the blows to the head. 
[03:22:30]  You get fucking fined.  You get suspended.  And it's a 15-yard penalty.  These guys got to live their lives later.  They can't walk around fucking, you know, with all timers by the time they're 40 and depression  leads all depression, suicide, all that other stuff.  So I support that 100%.  That's the only move he has made, the commissioner, that has made sense to me.  I know everyone's like, oh, this is bullshit.  This is a fucking flag football league, whatever.  You cannot hit guys to the head.  There's enough research there where it affects these guys later in life. 
[03:23:00]  So I get that.  I support that.  Other than that, everything else he does stinks.  It's all about him being afraid of getting sued because there's a little fucking rainfall.  We've got to stop the game.  We've got to just stop.  What?  Seriously, I mean, it's going to get to the point where what if it's really sunny?  Say it's a one o'clock game in Miami in September, and it's fucking 96 degrees out, and there's  humidity, and it's fucking brutal.  And I've been to that stadium before, and I lived in South Florida, and it's fucking hot,  especially in September. 
[03:23:30]  Are they going to push back the kickoff?  Because at one o'clock on Sunday, it's actually going to be 102, and the humidity is going  to be, it's going to make you feel like it's 130, 130 in that stadium.  So what we're going to do, you know, Dolphins and Bills, all of a sudden, one o'clock, we're  going to, you know, according to Doppler radar, it's going to get a lot cooler, about, you  know, 320, according to our maps.  So it's going to get down to like, you know, 88, and it's going to feel like 92. 
[03:24:00]  So we're going to wait a couple hours, because we don't, you know, it's a little hot.  And we don't want the players to get real sweaty.  That's what's going to happen.  It's going to get to the point where you play a game like in Miami, the commissioner is going  to make fucking guys run out in the field or on the sidelines every TV timeout and make  sure they drink their water so they can hydrate because it's fucking hot.  Because he doesn't want someone having a seizure or fucking overheating and dying on the field 
[03:24:30]  because he's not hydrated enough.  He's so dehydrated, he fucking passed out and dies on the field.  That's what's going to happen every TV timeout.  And they're going to have a guy next to the guy squirting water in his mouth, making sure  that he swallows it like you're in a fucking mental institute and they make sure you take  your medicine.  And they always have a guy open up.  Let me make sure you didn't fucking put that pill in the bottom under your tongue.  That's what's going to happen.  That's where we're heading.  It's sunny.  It's a little, they got to have their water.  Hold on. 
[03:25:00]  Another commercial break.  They look thirsty.  That stinks.  That's what the NFL has become.  He's going to make it where he'll make it where the players will have to wear sunscreen on  their arms because it's basically the only thing that's shown on their arms.  So in case, so just in case they can't sue the league later when they get skin cancer at 50,  and some guy comes out, well, I played on the Dolphins for 15 years and, you know, every 
[03:25:30]  Sunday and, you know, throughout the season when it was hot and sunny and I got skin cancer.  Look at this figure.  I got skin cancer on my fucking elbow and they had to take all the skin off and now it's spread  and I'm suing the NFL because they made me play out in the sun in the fall in South Florida for three hours  and I got cancer because of that, skin cancer because of that.  I'm suing the league.  He's going to make every player put sunscreen on. 
[03:26:00]  There's going to be a guy on the sideline checking each arm and if they don't put it on, they're fined.  They might get suspended.  You imagine that?  Imagine that Mike Wallace, the receiver from the Dolphins.  Mike Wallace suspended this week or fined $7,500 for not putting sunscreen on his arm last Sunday's game against the Browns.  They're going to have a guy on the sideline checking.  Maybe they'll have an NFL guy actually from the league make sure that they fucking put sunscreen on everybody's arm before kickoff. 
[03:26:30]  Just so he's protected, Roger Goodell, from any future lawsuits of skin cancer.  The fans, he could give a fuck about.  The 75,000 in that stadium, in the blistering heat, he don't give a shit.  Why would he care?  They can't sue.  Well, you can't prove that you went to a Dolphin game, you know, season tickets in 2013 gave you skin cancer when you were 50.  He could give a fuck about them.  All right, the NFL stopped caring about the fans and the weather, about the fans. 
[03:27:00]  Remember years ago, and that wasn't even years ago, maybe eight years ago, where every Sunday and Monday night game of December was either in a dome or was in Miami or was in a warm weather site.  Because the Sunday night games, it was too cold for the fucking fans to be sitting in Green Bay on December 29th where they played the Bears at an 8 o'clock game on a Sunday night.  Because the weather, you know, a Sunday afternoon at 1 o'clock is about 30 in Green Bay. 
[03:27:30]  At 8 o'clock at night, it's about 7 degrees with a zero windchill factor.  That's why the Dolphins always played.  Tampa Bay always played in December.  They always had those home games on Monday night, even the Sunday night games.  But they stopped that like eight years ago because they wanted ratings.  So all of a sudden now, the Bears play in January.  You know, last game of the season, January 2nd, 8 o'clock on a Sunday night.  And they used to worry about that.  They go, we don't want fans.  We don't want a guy taking his kids to the game, you know, and sitting there in fucking zero degree weather. 
[03:28:00]  You know, in a big game, a big, you know, game that's going to decide the division in December.  That's not fair.  And then they have to get up early in the morning, whatever.  But that's what they always did that.  But then all of a sudden, about eight years ago, when Sunday night football came in to play,  they go, look, look, we just need good games on.  We don't give a fuck.  What if the Dolphins are 3-10, you know, week 14?  So that's when they stopped to do that. 
[03:28:30]  That's when they stopped giving a fuck about the fans.  It's a blizzard in Chicago on a Sunday night, icy roads because it's fucking freezing out because it's zero degrees out.  And guys got to drive home at midnight after a game on fucking icy highways because they're not iced yet because the fucking salt guys aren't out.  They don't give a fuck.  That didn't come into play when they started putting those Sunday night and Monday night games in cold weather sites.  So it has nothing to do with the fans. 
[03:29:00]  It also has to do with the players on the field suing the league later on in life, whether they got skin cancer.  Maybe it was raining a little hard.  What a fucking joke.  What a joke this league has become.  Seriously, just put a roof over the fucking stadiums and get it over with.  Get it over with.  So there's no fucking climate where they could stop the game for any reason.  Just fucking set the A.C. in there at 65.  It's nice and comfortable for everybody. 
[03:29:30]  That's all you got to do.  I mean, this is a joke.  It's a fucking joke.  We've got to protect ourselves.  That's what he's sitting around talking to these fucking greedy motherfucker owners and the commission.  We've got to protect ourselves from lawsuits.  We just doled out $785 million for past concussions when we knew these guys were getting hurt.  We didn't give a fuck.  So, you know, we've got to be careful.  I'm a lawyer.  I know.  People could sue for anything. 
[03:30:00]  And these guys will have a good case because guys will feel bad.  The fans will feel bad.  And, you know, that, you know, Terrell Owens gets skin cancer at 42 because, you know, he played outside.  He didn't put sunscreen on.  And he's got frigging five kids.  And he's going to die.  And those kids are going to have a dad.  So, you know, they're not going to feel sorry for us.  We're the big bad guys.  So we really got to fucking, we got to think about this stuff.  I mean, they're going to stop games soon. 
[03:30:30]  Imagine if it's, if it's rainy and cold.  Picture a game in Green Bay, middle of December, one o'clock game.  It's fucking hailing, raining.  Little snow, wet snow, and it's freezing out.  It's 15 degrees out.  And the field's all sloppy and people, there's puddles all over and it's snowing. 
[03:31:00]  Imagine, they'd have to stop that game for that, too.  We looked at the Doppler radar and, you know, about 350, it looks like, you know, coming in.  You see the red here?  It's going to pass through between 320 and 350.  So we're going to continue the game at, like, 355.  And then we'll have, you know, the crew go on and try to, you know, get the fucking puddles off the field.  Because, look, these guys got kids and it's raining and cold and these guys are going to get sick. 
[03:31:30]  Because they're outside and it's raining and cold and they're going to get wet.  And, you know, if you get wet and it's cold, you know, when you go outside with a wet head and you catch cold,  we don't need these guys bringing home, because most of these guys got young kids at home.  We don't want these guys bringing the flu and colds back home to their little kids during the week.  And then them getting sick.  You know, a lot of them are infants.  And, you know, who knows? 
[03:32:00]  One could tragically die because, you know, Aaron Rodgers brought the flu home because we made him play in the wind and the rain and the snow.  And it was cold out and he got sick.  And then he brought it home to his little baby.  And the baby tragically died because he had the flu.  We can't take that chance.  So we're going to hold off the game for a little while.  We're going to put a tarp on the field until it stops.  And we'll come back around 350.  Because we can't risk these guys getting sick and bringing that back home to their families during the week. 
[03:32:30]  This isn't what the NFL is about.  We're about caring.  Let's fucking throw that theory out the window about going outside with a wet head and getting sick.  Okay?  And you just showered and you're going out to your car or you got to fucking do something real.  Maybe you just showered and you got to go shovel your driveway and your hair is still wet. 
[03:33:00]  And it's 30 degrees out.  You're not getting sick.  All right?  That's a fucking myth from 1950 that our grandmothers don't go outside with a wet head.  That's fucking...  It's...  All right.  Let's think about this.  If that's true, that whole theory about getting wet and it's cold and all that stuff,  how come when the Packers play the Bears on that game in December on a Sunday at 1 o'clock  and they're rolling around in the rain and it's cold and they're wet and their fucking socks are wet  and their feet are and they're just drenched and it's freezing out and they got chills, 
[03:33:30]  how come by Wednesday of that week they're not all listed on the injury report as fucking doubtful with the flu?  Or got flu-like symptoms.  Has there ever been a fucking football game canceled the next week because the Bears didn't have enough players  to fucking feel the team because the week before they played a home game in shitty weather  and they all got sick?  Never. 
[03:34:00]  Never.  They had us fucking 15 Packers got the flu from, look, they shouldn't have played that game outside.  I mean, it was raining.  What are you going to do?  That's part of the conditions.  But they're all sick this week because you know when, you know, if you're outside and it's wet,  you're going to get sick.  The Packers and Bears got 18 people apiece that got the flu from last week from playing outside.  So they're trying to reschedule a game, postpone this game to their bye week so they can move it there. 
[03:34:30]  So these guys are better.  All right.  It's fucking stupid.  It's nonsense.  Never going to happen.  But they will stop the game, the NFL, because of that.  These guys, I don't want to bring it at home.  They're their families.  That's what it's going to come to.  When you're stopping games for lightning, three in two weeks, when there's never been a fucking lightning  to hit a stadium where no one's ever died watching an NFL game because there was lightning.  That's what this is going to come to when it's cold and rainy, when it's fucking sunny, the skin cancer, all of this shit. 
[03:35:00]  That's what we're coming to.  Are they going to ban?  While we're at it, they might as well just ban trash talking because that eventually is going to happen.  Some pussy is going to go.  Well, guy in the defense, you know, Carlos Dansby was talking trash the whole game saying my mom's a whore. 
[03:35:30]  You know, look, my mom had, you know, four kids from four different guys.  All right.  Why does he have to say that?  Why does he have to go there?  Fuck me up.  Fuck my head up.  That ain't right.  If I was on a street corner, I'd fight that guy, but I can't fight him on the field.  And that hurts because my mom did the best job she can.  She's not a whore.  She's the best job, you know, raising me.  I got a good family.  He's called my wife, my mom, a whore.  It's going to get to the point, look, we don't need that.  You know, that's bullying.  That will be a form of bullying soon when you're trash talking on the field. 
[03:36:00]  That Cadell is going to go, look, we don't condone bullying.  And, you know, if we hear trash talking, any refs, they're throwing a flag 15 yards.  Imagine that.  The ref comes on.  Yes, number 56 on the Arizona Cardinal defense, Dansby, 15 yards for calling Reggie Bush's mom a fucking whore and a cunt.  We're going to mark that off first and goal. 
[03:36:30]  That's where we're heading with this commissioner.  You know, it's a little hot.  We better, according to Doppler radar, we're going to have to postpone the game.  We're going to wait a little while.  Well, you don't understand how much I can't wait for Super Bowl Sunday played in New Jersey outside. 
[03:37:00]  First of all, the commissioner made the Dolphins renovate their stadium, like I said, because his cronies got a little wet.  But a Super Bowl a few years ago, I think it was the Colts and Bears Super Bowl.  It started raining in South Florida in January.  God forbid it was 82 and it was a little rain, like it's going to affect anybody.  And he said, the only way we'll come back here with Super Bowl is you guys put a roof over, like, at least where the fans sit, not so much on the field. 
[03:37:30]  How fucking weird is that going to be?  Because my, you know, my fucking, you know, Wall Street and fucking, you know, billionaire cronies, we got wet and they had nice suits on and we can't have that.  But so he makes the fucking Dolphins try to raise 300 million to fix their stadium or he won't have another Super Bowl.  He basically holds them hostage, puts a gun to their head.  He knows how much that helps the economy in South Florida.  It's great to have a fucking Super Bowl in January in Florida. 
[03:38:00]  You go to South Beach, you hang out there the whole week.  There's a bunch of shit going on.  The weather's great.  You can go golfing, go to the beach, get laid, all of that shit, casinos.  But no, but then the state of New Jersey or whoever gives him and his fucking NFL fucking billionaire owners an extra like 50 million to split or 100 million to split, which is like 3 million a team.  And they go, yeah, we're going to have it outside in New Jersey.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, you got how much money you're going to give us?  Sure.  No problem.  We'll do it outside in February in New Jersey.  That's why, that's the only reason the Super Bowl's here because they fucking gave them more money.  They fucking greased them.  Here, come on, have it outside.  So don't fucking tell me you care about conditions of a stadium.  And of course, with the Super Bowl tickets, I don't know if you guys notice, last year in New Orleans, the best ticket, the 50-yard line seat was 2,600 bucks, which is a fucking joke. 
[03:39:00]  This year, $5,200 for tickets anywhere, anywhere tickets between the 240-yard lines, 40, 50, 40.  All those seats in there, premium seats they're called at the giant stadium, the new stadium, $5,200 are those tickets.  The cheapest ticket is 1,000 bucks all the way up in the corner in the end zone, which is fucking, if you've ever been to that stadium, you sit up top.  It's almost like you're watching from a plane. 
[03:39:30]  You know when you're in a plane and you look down and you see a game going on?  You're like, oh, that's pretty cool.  That's what those fucking seats look like.  And that's the cheapest seat, 1,000 bucks.  And you know why the 5,200?  Because the NFL decided, said, you know what, we checked the secondary market and any seats that sell for 2,600, they sell really quick for like 4,000 or 5,000 online.  So we're just trying to be competitive and knock out the secondary market.  No, you're not, you fucking scumbags. 
[03:40:00]  How could you even release that statement?  That's what the NFL came out and said.  You know, we're just trying to close that gap between the secondary markets because we don't want these guys making all this money.  You know, buying tickets and just selling them for twice as much.  So we're going to close that.  Oh, yeah, and who does that affect?  Not everybody goes in the secondary market to buy that ticket.  So you're basically just fucking the fans by raising the price 100% from last year's Super Bowl because you see that some tickets could sell for $5,200 online. 
[03:40:30]  So you decide to fuck everybody that's going to sit on the 40 to the 40, all those people.  You're going to charge them double from last year because you checked the secondary market and you decided that they can get that much for that ticket.  You motherfuckers.  So don't ever say you care about the fans, ever.  Don't ever utter those words when you pull shit like that.  Let's say, you know, I don't know, let's say the Texans get in the Super Bowl against Seattle this year and it's in Giant Stadium and some guy's got two kids that are huge Seahawks fans. 
[03:41:00]  You know, the Seahawks have sucked for a long time and they're finally in the Super Bowl and they're like 10 and 12 and this is their fucking dream.  They may never get back there again.  And this guy wants to bring his kids for a fucking, you know, to bring his kids to a Super Bowl, the Seahawks actually in the Super Bowl.  And for three tickets, it's going to cost them $15,600.  And you say you care about the fans. 
[03:41:30]  This would be a dream come true.  These kids are going to remember that fucking when he's 90 years old, sitting on his porch and they're fucking 50.  Dad, I can't believe you brought, we went to that Super Bowl and the Seahawks won.  And we fucking flew to New Jersey and saw that game.  They can't have that memory because of these fucking scumbags.  That's what's going on.  So this is what I hope happens on Super Bowl Sunday. 
[03:42:00]  Because that's the NFL's worst nightmare, that it's going to be miserable out, the weather.  If they're stopping games now, imagine how much they're going to panic.  Roger Goodell right now is fucking thumbing through the farmer's almanac to look at February 5th or whatever the date is, that Super Bowl, panicking.  He's looking at his Doppler radar on his fucking smartphone.  Shit, I can't get February yet.  What's going on?  Panicking that it's going to be fucking miserable that day. 
[03:42:30]  I hope Super Bowl Sunday in New Jersey is a mixture of rain, snow, sleet, wind, hail, ice.  And I hope Goodell and his rich buddies have to watch from their fucking fully heated skybox.  Because you know they're going to be in their sky.  It's going to be fucking, you know, 75 and fucking nice and crispy, warm.  He might even have a fire going in this fucking skybox where him and his buddies are going to be watching the game. 
[03:43:00]  So he doesn't give a fuck.  It's not going to affect him.  I mean, you know, he's not getting wet.  And I hope the game is really sloppily played.  All that shit's going on.  There's fumbles.  They can't throw the ball.  Everybody's fucking slipping.  As soon as they get the ball, the running back, he fucking falls in the backfield.  They try to throw one pass.  It fucking wobbles.  In the rain, it goes off his fingertips.  So they just decide to just keep running the ball and punting. 
[03:43:30]  And it's just one punt after another, after another, and after another.  And they're looking at the Doppler radar.  Because at fucking two minutes left in the first half, it's 0-0.  There's been 16 punts and only 120 yards of total offense in the game.  And Goodell is panicking.  He's got his fucking Doppler radar on his flat screen TV in his little fucking skybox with his buddies.  What's going on?  When is this weather going to stop?  We've got to stop this game. 
[03:44:00]  People are going to tune out.  This is going to be the worst fucking rated Super Bowl of all time.  This is boring.  What does the Doppler radar say?  Let me call the way.  Oh, it's going to stop at fucking 8.  It's not going to stop until midnight.  And right now it's 7 o'clock.  We can't hold this game off until midnight.  Are you sure?  Yeah, look at the red down here.  You see it.  It's coming through.  It's going to keep going this way.  So not until midnight.  So I don't know what to tell you, Roger. 
[03:44:30]  You're a fucking control freak, but you can't control the weather.  Yeah, look at my dad calling that Doppler radar.  Sorry, do you have Doppler radar on your phone?  You fucking asshole that owns the Texans?  Yeah.  Looks the same here too.  That's what's going to be going on.  He's going to be panicking.  What do I do?  He's going to hear from people, but you know, his wife's going to call.  Yeah, our Super Bowl party sucks.  People want to leave.  It's so boring.  And then you got that fucking Bruno San Martino playing at halftime. 
[03:45:00]  Nobody even knows who he is.  Roger, what did you do?  You fucked this up.  Don't even come home tonight.  And the guys that, and then the third quarter starts, nothing.  Maybe there's a field goal.  It's three, nothing.  Four minutes left in the game.  And in the third quarter, it's three, nothing.  It's the most boring game ever.  And everyone in those $5,200 seats sees you up in your skybox with your fucking cronies 
[03:45:30]  and you're sweating because it's hot in there because you have the heat on where everybody  else is fucking freezing their ass off sitting in the stands.  And you're sweating because of that and because you're, because this game is a disaster and  they all just turn around and give you the fucking finger.  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Thanks for putting us out here.  Thanks for charging us $5,200 for the seat.  Nice shitty game because you took an extra $100 million to have it in the cold weather  because you didn't give a shit. 
[03:46:00]  You just took the money and ran like you do everything else in the league.  That's what I want to happen.  And then the final score is 6-3.  Seattle beats the Texans 6-3.  There were seven turnovers by Seattle and five by the Texans.  The Texans had 92 total yards in offense and Seattle had 114.  Matt Schaub went four for 16 for 38 yards and one interception. 
[03:46:30]  And Russell Wilson went five for 11 for 26 yards.  No touchdowns, no interceptions.  No receiver had more than 22 yards receiving.  That's what I want to fucking happen. 
[03:47:00]  6-3.  The most boring Super Bowl in history.  Nobody watched San Martino at halftime.  Nobody, people tuned out.  People like, fuck it, I'm going home.  This sucks.  This blows.  And then on the way home, Goodell and his cronies getting his fucking,  his Hummer SUV fucking limo.  You know, those ones that are like fucking 30 yards long.  And all his buddies, they're going back to New York City to figure out what the hell went wrong. 
[03:47:30]  And they're going to go to a party because like, hey, what the hell, you know.  And they're all going back to New York.  Oh, man, how was a disaster?  We can't have let that happen again.  And on the way home, because it's fucking, there's a storm going for like eight hours.  They hit a big fucking, they hit a big like flood zone in the middle of the road,  like Route 3 going back to New York City.  And their fucking Hummer just goes off the road.  And it goes into the Passaic River. 
[03:48:00]  And what happens is it floats, their Hummer floats all the way down to the worst part of Newark,  New Jersey, the ghetto, the fucking gang section of Newark, New Jersey.  I don't know if the Passaic River goes to Newark, New Jersey.  I think it does.  I haven't, I lived in Jersey my whole life.  I should know that.  But let's fucking suspend disbelief here and say that the fucking, their stretch limo, Hummer,  whatever the hell it is, is going to float and it's going to land right into the gangland 
[03:48:30]  in Newark, New Jersey.  It's going to float right up ashore there.  And there's going to be a bunch of thugs there with their fucking guns and drugs.  And Goodell's going to get out of it and his cronies.  And they're going to stand there.  And he's going to have to tell them, they'll be like,  what the fuck are you doing here in Newark?  What is this?  Give us that Hummer.  We're taking it.  Who are you?  And he's going to think, you know, I can relate to everybody.  I'm the NFL commissioner of the league.  And, you know, we just, you know, we hit a flood and we floated all the way down here. 
[03:49:00]  And we just, yeah.  And the guys make, oh, so you're the guy from, you're the commissioner.  You're in the NFL.  Yeah.  Oh, so why did you have the game here in New Jersey, motherfucker?  That game was so boring, we just went back down the street and just started shooting people again  and robbing people because it was that, but we were looking forward to it.  You're the commissioner.  You don't want to make old decisions.  Yeah, I make old decisions.  Yeah.  How come you put the fucking NFL network on it? 
[03:49:30]  How come you hijacked every cable company and made them pay $3 a month for your shitty channel  and your shitty Thursday night games that me and my buddies like to watch the NFL?  That's our only release living around here.  And we couldn't watch any of those games for 10 years.  And even now, most of the time we can't find that game because only 60% of America gets the NFL network.  Why did you fucking hijack every company? 
[03:50:00]  Time Warner, Cablevision, every fucking cable company around the country.  And they said, no, we're not paying you $3 a month for your shitty channel that shows shitty Thursday night games.  Well, that was, you know, I just, you know, we're trying to build something.  Why are you fucking raping us again?  You're putting the fucking, the Chiefs and the Raiders on a Thursday night.  Nobody wants to see that game. 
[03:50:30]  Well, you're right.  All right, I'm so, you know, look, we're just trying to get back to New York.  That's all we're trying to do.  Are you the guy that said PSLs are a good investment?  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, they are.  I mean, because, you know, season tickets, $20,000 a seat, you could resell it.  Did anyone ever resell it on the secondary market?  No.  No, people are actually giving them away.  They don't even give a shit.  So then you are a fucking liar.  You're a scumbag.  And then Roger Goodell goes, look, I'll give you a fucking, here's an NFL hat. 
[03:51:00]  Can you guys, look, it's still got the tag on it.  You guys like wearing a fucking hat with still, with the tag on it.  I don't know why.  I don't understand that culture.  But here, here's a bunch of fucking Super Bowl.  Here, the Seahawks won.  I actually have hats with fucking tags on it.  Here, you guys are the first ones to get it.  Here's your hats.  And then I go, you know what?  Good, because we're going to be the first ones in the neighborhood to have these hats.  So, all right, fine. 
[03:51:30]  But let me tell you something.  We live on the streets.  Every day we get, we're worried about getting killed.  There's gunfire.  We're just living our, we're trying to live our lives.  We don't know if we walk out the door.  We're dead the next minute.  We got families here.  It's a fucking war zone here.  Okay.  And we're living second to second because nobody will do anything to stop the violence here.  Don't ever stop an NFL game ever again because it's raining.  Don't ever stop because there's lightning. 
[03:52:00]  Don't ever do that.  People complain in those conditions.  You think the guys out here that are fucking killing people every day go, ah, there's thunderstorms tonight.  We better fucking hold off going to rob the fucking liquor store and then killing anybody in our path.  Really?  It's thunderstorms?  Yeah, look at, look at my Doppler radar on my fucking phone that I just stole from some old lady.  Says it's not going to let up to like four in the morning.  The liquor store closed at two.  So let's wait till tomorrow.  Yeah, you're right. 
[03:52:30]  We don't want to get wet when we go on a killing spree.  Does that make sense, motherfucker?  I never heard it said that way.  You're right.  I will not stop any more NFL games ever.  I know I'm a pussy and I'm afraid everybody's going to sue me.  But you know what?  I'm not going to be a commissioner forever.  Who gives a shit?  Later on in life, they get a fucking skin cancer. 
[03:53:00]  You know, whatever else happens.  They get a cold.  They pass along to somebody.  That's not my problem.  I don't give a fuck.  You're right.  I'm a big pussy and I'm going to stop being a pussy.  I'm not stopping any more games.  You go to NFL game, whatever conditions they are.  That's what you deal with.  That's what we did in the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, even the 90s.  So.  I'll never stop again.  I don't give a fuck about Doppler radar.  All right, Commissioner, you and your fucking white, rich douche. 
[03:53:30]  Billionaire crone.  Get the fuck out of here.  Just go.  The train's right over there.  You guys go walk.  Be a fucking person like everybody else.  A regular civilian and take the train back to New York.  You cocksuckers.  Don't ask me where I came up with that.  I have no idea.  There's no reason for that.  I think I'm living in fantasy land that I came up with a story that a limo floated down the fucking river into the ghetto section in Newark and that all went down. 
[03:54:00]  I highly doubt that would ever happen.  But like I said, let's suspend disbelief just like pretty much everything else in life.  Yeah, you've just experienced Jim Florentine's podcast.
