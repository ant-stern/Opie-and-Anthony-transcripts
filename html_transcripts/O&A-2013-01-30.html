<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about the attractiveness of large women, quickly descending into crude jokes about body odor and sweat. This segued into Anthony’s recent illness and his self-absorbed approach to avoiding infecting others, followed by complaints about bad drivers, culminating in Opie's confession of throwing a lug nut remover at a car during a road rage incident.  The conversation then veered into the surprisingly high number of animals killed by cats annually, prompting a story about Opie's feral cat and its gruesome "gifts." This led to recollections of accidents and deaths near Opie's childhood home, including a drunk driver crashing into the house, and a discussion of a proposed Irish law allowing isolated farmers to drink and drive, which Opie supported. Further discussion ensued regarding reckless driving on Long Island, focusing on the driving habits of Hispanic drivers.

The show then moved to a discussion of Alex Rodriguez, his unpopularity, and steroid allegations, followed by a Craigslist Super Bowl ticket scam and Joe Flacco's apology for using the word "retarded."  This spurred a debate on the appropriateness of offensive language, referencing past show discussions and MSNBC's editing of a Sandy Hook victim's father's interview to create a biased narrative, prompting a broader discussion on media ethics.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Ray Lewis's use of deer antler spray, prompting a caller to explain its production.

The next segment began with humorous discussion on the ineffectiveness of cockroach decapitation, quickly transitioning to deer antler spray and a bizarre anecdote about breast milk ice cream.  The hosts then discussed gang violence, focusing on a Rick Ross shooting and the alleged practice of rappers paying protection money.  This was followed by a lengthy critique of Mayor Thomas Menino's incomprehensible "State of the City" address.  The show then discussed Jim Norton's new 90-inch TV and Jim's finger injury from a car seat. The segment concluded with Rich Vos creating a protein powder mess in the studio and promoting his film at the Athena Film Festival. Profanity and vulgar language were frequent throughout this segment.

The following segment covered a range of loosely connected topics. It began with a discussion of the Athena Film Festival, followed by banter about Rich Vos's golf game and protein powder consumption, and a humorous discussion about life insurance policies. The main focus shifted to a graphic video of a woman and her children assaulting a security guard, described with highly offensive language.  The hosts repeatedly played and commented on the video.  The conversation then shifted to Sal's childhood experiences, contrasting them with those of a previous guest, Mars, including a graphic story about his great-grandmother urinating on his grandmother.  The discussion returned to Mars’s childhood trauma, with graphic descriptions of his mother’s behavior.  The segment then moved to discussions of attractive women in commercials, using sexually suggestive language and detailed descriptions of their physical attributes.  Finally, the segment touched on Jim Norton’s upcoming shows with guest Bailey Jay and concluded with a discussion of a soldier who received a limb transplant, described with vulgar language.

The next segment began with a discussion about a man who survived losing all four limbs in an explosion, including speculation about the recovery process and use of anti-rejection drugs. The conversation then veered into darkly humorous tangents about medieval torture. Comedian Tom Papa joined the show, participating in a guessing game about a guest on Tom's radio show (revealed to be Rich Vos).  The discussion then shifted to winter weather, its depressing effects, and a desire for warmer climates, leading to further humorous and often offensive discussions about snowmen and winter activities.  They also discussed drones and their potential uses, including in pornography, and expressed skepticism about the BlackBerry 10.  Tom Papa promoted his upcoming shows, and the segment transitioned to Jim Norton's segment.

The final segment was a "very important" advice show featuring Bailey Jay. Callers discussed various relationship issues, including breast reduction surgery disclosure, objectification of women, erectile dysfunction, anal sex, pegging, inorgasmic ejaculation,  a roommate suspected of being gay, and the effects of being shot and taking Zoloft on sexual function. The hosts and Bailey Jay offered advice on these issues, and the segment included frank discussions of male and female behavior in relationships, power dynamics, sex addiction, and the use of Viagra and enemas.  A caller’s question about using other comedians’ material was addressed, as was a question about erectile dysfunction following a breakup. The segment concluded with a commercial for a product to mask the taste of semen and Bailey Jay promoting her podcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Happy hump day.  Hi, everybody.  Happy hump day.  Heading toward the weekend.  All right.  Rip Hogan is sexy, man. 
[00:00:30]  No, man. She's not.  She's too big.  No way. Look at the beautiful legs.  She's fantastic.  She's an Amazon woman.  You like the Amazon women.  They have a big, long ass.  Look at that.  A big, long ass?  No one wants a big, long ass.  Is that a good thing, Jimmy?  I mean, juicy.  Look at her legs. She's great.  She's solid, but that's a little too big, man.  Oh, man.  She's got to be about 5'10".  I would say 5'10", 160 pounds.  For a goof.  What do you think? For a goof. 
[00:01:00]  No, I would go there in a second.  Don't get me wrong, but she's 5'11".  And how much do you think she weighs?  160?  160.  She's a big girl.  They kiss those big, long, smooth Florida legs.  Oof.  She's a big girl.  Like her big feet.  Look, she's in really good shape, but that's a big girl.  Yeah, that's pretty good right there.  I do.  But that's a big girl.  She'd wrap those big legs around you and just, come on, come for mama.  And you know she sweats like a man.  That could be a problem.  I like that.  If it's under the arms and it stinks a little.  A woman sweats like a man.  Not in her back. 
[00:01:30]  A woman with back sweat should be killed.  Or it just starts dripping into their crack.  Yeah, why does sweat have to funnel down like a rain gutter through your ass crack, through  the most heinous place on the human body?  Just funnels in.  Picking up all that goodness.  Oh, it's like tea steeping.  Yes.  It's like a drip coffee maker.  They really should, like, bottle that shit.  That's disgusting.  You know there's some fucking perv out there that would enjoy that?  A nice teabag filled with... 
[00:02:00]  Once it reaches the taint, it drips off.  What the fuck?  We're going to go with that?  Oh, there we go.  Thank you.  This is supposed to be a quick bit.  We're going to do 15 minutes on that?  Shut up.  Jesus.  Right.  Shut your fucking mouth.  What?  How's Anthony feeling?  You're all right there?  Yeah.  You know, you take your fucking Dayquil.  You spray some Afrin up your nostrils and that's it.  It wasn't that bad.  I just wasn't sure if I was creeping up on flu territory.  Fuck.  And, you know, the last thing I wanted to do was injure anybody, any of my loved ones here 
[00:02:30]  at the stage.  Liar!  So, I...  You don't care about giving anyone the flu.  No, I really do.  You barely care about yourself.  Why would you care about giving anyone the flu?  I love me.  Oh, that's true.  I would...  That's true.  You do love yourself.  And that's the reason.  Believe me, it's very self-centered.  I would feel so guilty if I gave someone the flu and they died.  Oh, my God!  I would fucking...  What the fuck?  Like, it would fuck my life up.  So, again, through my complete selfishness, I stayed away so as not to have some psychological 
[00:03:00]  burden on myself, you know, if something happened.  I'm a huge fan of the flu shot.  Yeah?  It's...  I don't know why, if this is available, that people just don't do it.  I'm very petrified of the flu shot.  I'm starting to worry that my flu shot's wearing off.  I want to get maybe another dose.  Get another one?  Why not?  Just to get through the second half of winter.  Winter's pretty...  Almost...  Is moving along nicely.  I'm glad I got it.  January's almost over.  Yeah.  To me, man, when we get through February, it's all... 
[00:03:30]  It's easy.  Do people get two flu shots?  I don't know.  I want to know.  I don't think so.  I want to get another dose.  They give one per season.  Something like that.  Yeah.  I hear it's starting to calm down, though.  The widespreadness of the outbreak.  I love the flu shot.  I'm a big fan.  Yeah.  I don't know why people wouldn't like it.  Every fucking year with the flu.  Every year, I was out for two weeks.  Easy.  Maybe not from the show, but certainly out of my own body for two weeks.  Flu. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  The flu.  And not even a cold this season.  Yeah.  Not even a fucking cold.  That's a good one.  I get the kids bringing germs home all the fucking time.  So they're sick every other week.  Oh, man.  Now we got the big weather change, which always fucks people up.  It goes from freezing cold to, you know, in the 60s today.  No.  Yeah.  60 now?  It's at 60 today.  And then a lot of rain tonight.  High winds through the area. 
[00:04:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I know it's very foggy out there today.  Yeah.  Driving in was a treat.  Not because of fog so much, because people are fucking idiots.  I understand people get a little petrified of driving in adverse weather conditions.  But fog at night is a lot easier to drive in than fog in the day.  The lights show you pretty much everything.  Right.  You know, in the daytime, it's very white and fucking glary and foggy.  So people do like, they slow down to the point where, you know, you come up on them fast. 
[00:05:00]  No, why?  Because they can't understand the concept that if you just turn off your high beams, you  could see way better.  Right.  But they think, no, the high beams will cut through the fog.  No, it's the opposite.  More light, more good.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's the worst.  But as soon as you turn the high beams off, you're like, oh, I could see much better.  People are adults.  But they can't figure that shit out in their heads.  We're talking, of course, to the 10% of the people out there that are dumb.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not you, the intelligent listener of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And I had to deal with a fucking, another cab fucking thing that gets me.  Something they do almost on an every morning basis.  The wonderful and talented Fred Nars was pulling up this morning in the cab.  Boo on the radio show.  Boo.  Like he usually does around the same time I get here.  Yeah.  And there's a limited number of parking spaces in front of this building.  I have to park and then come upstairs and then Kenny comes down and grabs my truck. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  When a cab drops someone off, there's no need for them to half-assed pull into a spot that's  available to let someone off.  So you said they could pull up next to a car that's already parked there and position their  door for their passenger between two cars, let's say.  You're trying to say a cab should give a fuck?  A cabbie should give a fuck?  No, but when I...  They don't give a fuck about anybody.  When he was pulling up and I go, bibib, like I tuned him like and put my blinker on so 
[00:06:30]  we knew that was a spot.  It was the only spot and then I had to go down the street more.  Right.  He knew he could have pulled up.  But he don't give a fuck.  Well, you know what?  Then I don't give a fuck when they get shot.  Wow.  When they get robbed.  Wow.  When they fucking have accidents that kill them.  Wow.  I hate the cabs.  They don't give a fuck, though.  No, they don't.  So what happened?  They will...  What do you think happened?  I had to pull up the street.  Oh, you didn't have any competition with the guy?  No, no.  Well, on the way in, Fred was laughing because he heard me yelling. 
[00:07:00]  So he gets out of the cab.  It's too early to yell.  And then the cabbie saw that I was, like, bitching him out and I looked and I was like,  yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they always pull this shit.  And Kenny started laughing at me.  I'm a fucking...  I'm a joy when I'm walking in this building.  Everyone gets a good laugh.  You gotta calm down.  No.  Your day's just started.  No.  And you know these cabbies are shit.  They're the worst fucking things.  They will swerve from the right side all the way to the left side in front of you because 
[00:07:30]  they think they might have a person to pick up.  Yeah.  Especially in the morning when it's a little more desperate out there for customers.  And then over the weekend, I was driving out on Long Island and for some reason, this  guy in front of me, the light turns green and he's stopping.  He's doing two miles an hour.  So I go to go around him and he gets in front of me.  Right.  And then in front of me again and he won't let me get around him.  Oh, boy.  So then we stop at another light and I roll my window down and he rolls down and he goes,  you cut me off back there. 
[00:08:00]  And I didn't cut him off.  I know what I did.  I changed lanes.  A couple rounds to the side of his vehicle?  No.  I would have loved to.  Try to pop the gas tank?  I fucking...  This guy then was pulling the same shenanigans when the light turned green again.  Right.  I must have followed him trying to get around the side of his car way out of my way.  We are fucking driving like mania.  And now he's a fag who won't let me fucking get next to him.  Right.  He won't let me get next to him.  He keeps pulling in front of me. 
[00:08:30]  He was good.  He was pretty good.  Did he get him at the end?  I fucking got him at a light where he had nowhere to go.  He was stuck.  I pull up next to him on top of one of these triangular little medians where you got a right  turn and straight and that.  So I pull up right next to his car.  I looked down.  I had one of those big fucking lug nut adapter remover things sitting in my console.  Fucking grabbed it.  I wing it at his back window.  It hits his back window.  It didn't break it, which pissed me off.  You were going for a window break? 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  How about you put gloves on first?  No, I don't care.  It flies up off the window like a ramp and comes crashing down on someone else's SUV  in front of him.  That's great.  That's just wonderful.  No, no.  So here's what happens.  So the door opens.  So the door of that vehicle opens.  The guy turns around.  Right.  And I'm out of my fucking door already going, this guy's throwing shit at everyone's cars.  Oh, my God.  He's throwing shit at everyone's cars.  Why would you do that? 
[00:09:30]  And then the guy starts yelling at him.  He goes, what the fuck's your problem, dude?  He goes, I didn't do it.  I go, he's a fucking lion sack of shit.  The guy goes, he's been throwing stuff at me from behind us.  Oh, my God.  It was great.  It was in your fucking mind.  So what happened?  How great is that?  Oh, it was fantastic.  I got such pleasure that I didn't even have to follow him anymore.  Did the guy have to deny it?  Yes.  He was all like freaked out.  He thought the guy was going to kill him.  Did he know it came from you?  Yes.  Oh, God.  He saw me wing it at him.  Fucking prick. 
[00:10:00]  You know.  It's terrible.  Oh, it's awful out there.  That is funny, man.  It's a dog-eat, dog-eat, dog-eat, dog-eat world.  Yes, it really is.  It's a puppy-eat-puppy world.  Yes.  Apparently, it's a kitten-eat-everything world, too.  You know, cats eat over a billion animals a year here in the country.  Do they really?  Yeah, I heard a story today.  No, I heard the tease.  Didn't they say kittens, cute and cuddly, or killers?  I think that was the tease. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, you're a little...  I'm like, they're not killers.  Relax.  What are they doing?  Eating mice?  It's mice and birds, pretty much.  But they kill, like, billions of fucking animals a year.  Well, on Long Island, there's the chipmunks.  What's that?  Chipmunks.  Fuck.  Chipmunks.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Or something.  And I brought a...  Or something.  Give me a banana.  What are you, singing on a record or something?  What the fuck?  I mean...  And I brought a cat home from Buffalo that was a bit wild.  It was a wild cat.  A little feral cat?  Yeah, it was a stray cat that I brought in and kind of tried to... 
[00:11:00]  I have a feral cat.  Make the best of it.  Shig-a-doop, meow, shig-a-doop, shig-a-doop, meow.  And this fucking thing wanted to be outside, no matter what.  Yeah.  I couldn't take the wildness out of this stray cat.  And every night when I came home from BAB real late, he would come running down from  the woods.  I was living with my parents at the time.  Oh, no.  And he would bring me a present almost every night.  So I know they're killers.  Yeah.  And he was all about the chipmunks.  Liked killing them chipmunks. 
[00:11:30]  And he would plop it at my feet and then go, all right, let's go inside and go to bed.  How weird is that?  Why do some of these animals feel like they have to bring you a present like that?  Yeah.  I've heard that before, too.  Oh, they brought me a present.  It's like, no.  I fucking ripped apart half of a mole.  Right.  It's not a present.  Those little moles are ugly.  A few made it into the house because you're just now letting the cat in and you're not  really paying attention that there's something in his mouth.  Yeah.  And he drops it in the living room.  And it runs off, dying under your couch.  Oh, no. 
[00:12:00]  He made sure these things were dead.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  The old fucking tiger around the throat thing.  Oh, yeah.  He took care of the problem.  That shit.  Nice.  Then the fucking cat, you know, met his demise in front of the house.  Oh.  Oh, a car?  Yeah, the house of death.  Cat versus car.  Rarely cat wins.  Cat versus car.  Dog versus car many times.  Ooh, that's a bad one.  And then, unfortunately, the last one was dad versus car.  Had a lot of death in front of the house I was brought up in. 
[00:12:30]  Dad died in front of my house.  Jesus.  Fucking my pet cat.  And one, two, three, at least four dogs.  At least.  And that's a family making sure we, you know, keep the dogs safe because we knew that we  lived on the busy highway.  What a treacherous hairpin turn over there.  It was a horrendous hairpin turn.  And we had many car accidents just right in front of our house.  And we had a car hit our house.  These are all stories I've told over the years, but I'm just putting it all together. 
[00:13:00]  When I was 12 or 13, I believe, after seeing Midway with my dad.  When was Midway out?  Midway.  I got to make sure my math's right.  Wow, that's in the 70...  Was it Midway?  I think it might have been Midway.  Oh, boy.  We were all woken up in the middle of the night because a fucking drunk driver hit our  house.  They estimated he was going about 70, 80 miles an hour and hit the corner of our house.  Completely destroyed the right side of our big house.  Really?  Did the whole house shake?  Yeah, we couldn't even open the front door. 
[00:13:30]  He hit so hard.  And there were cracks in all the...  Yeah.  Holy shit.  We could not open a fucking door to get out.  We actually had to get out the windows to make sure the house was safe enough.  Yeah.  Oh, it was a big fucking deal.  And the fucking guy, man, the drunk drivers never die.  No, they just sit there going, yeah, what happened?  The percentage of drunk drivers that die, I think, is pretty low for whatever reason.  Because I think you're so...  Didn't we talk about this on the show?  You're relaxed.  You're so relaxed that you fucking could deal with anything. 
[00:14:00]  Babies and drunk drivers.  They see a lot of times survive things.  Drunk babies are the best people to drive with.  Yeah.  Because they never get hurt.  And they're so fucking zoated, they don't give a fuck.  But this car fucking rolled after it hit our house.  Rolled, rolled.  Taking out the whole right side of the house.  Windows and all.  Mostly windows at that point.  The damage was when it hit the corner.  Landed way the fuck in our backyard.  I mean, not much of the car was left.  Isn't that weird when you see a car where it's not supposed to be like that in the backyard? 
[00:14:30]  And then we're all peeking out the windows.  And there's just this fucking drunk guy walking around our wiffle ball field.  It's like, that can't be the guy.  With pieces of car everywhere.  We found pieces of car for years after that.  Every once in a while, we find a little something something.  It was almost like a little treat.  And the guy didn't realize how lucky he was?  Well, I guess the story goes, I would have to have a brother or somebody back me up.  But the story goes, he actually was going to Huntington Hospital to see his friend who  was in a drunk driving accident. 
[00:15:00]  So his friend was in bad shape at the hospital.  He went to go visit him.  And now he gets in this horrific accident on the way home.  Fucking people.  And the whole reason is because the stupid town put a guardrail where all the cars would  have just went flying into the woods.  Right.  Where there's no houses.  But what happened was they would hit that fucking guardrail and we were the target.  Oh, so the guardrail would end and just fling the car off into your house.  It would.  No, it would hit the guardrail.  But like I said, these cars would have just went into like this wooded area. 
[00:15:30]  Who gives a fuck?  So they would hit the guardrail instead because the town realized too many cars were going  into the woods and it would make them ricochet.  So it would hit and then it would make them do a nice left turn.  Oh, and then, you know, into your house, right into our fucking house.  Yeah.  Hey, I also heard over the weekend that Ireland wants to have something where you have a drunk  driver license. 
[00:16:00]  And if you recall, that's been my plan for many years.  I've been pushing this legislation.  A bit self-serving, but a good idea.  Yes, where you actually take like a road test while you're drinking.  It's a very thing.  You probably have to pay a lot of money for it.  It's very scientifically done.  And then they gauge how well you can drive with a certain blood alcohol level.  And then that is stamped on your license.  But how high will they allow it to go up? 
[00:16:30]  Well, it depends on how good you are.  No, I understand, but they can't have it to the point where you could be completely fucking  way over the limit.  I'm even saying.  It has to be within some kind of range.  Now it's .08.  Right.  It's like drunk.  But I'm saying they're not giving licenses out to .2.  No, exactly.  I'm saying a good, give me maybe 1.3.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  I'm thinking 1.3 is pretty good limit.  Like, no one could be higher than that. 
[00:17:00]  But you could get over 1, and if you have this endorsement, this drunk driver endorsement.  Are they really doing that?  I don't know what they're doing.  I just heard that.  What are they doing in Ireland?  Why are they really doing that?  What are they doing?  Some small town politicians want to pass a motion asking the government to create a  permit that would allow isolated farmers the ability to drink a few pints and then return  home in their car or their tractor without fear of being busted.  See, I want that. 
[00:17:30]  I want to drive a tractor when I'm drunk.  It's backers say the measure.  You're going to hurt yourself.  The measure is needed to combat an epidemic of boredom and depression on farms ever since  Ireland imposed tough new blood alcohol limits on drivers in 2011.  So it would just be for these isolated farmers who just want to go get a couple pints and  then drive back to their small little farm.  Same thing here with me.  Yeah, or a tractor.  In a fucking tractor.  They're not going to hurt themselves.  What are they going to do?  They're going to roll right over your fucking head on the way home.  Exactly.  What?  Three miles an hour?  Stop.  How about they get a fucking farm friend or how about they have some Amish kid from 
[00:18:00]  down the road drop him off?  Get me a...  Have a cocky drop me off.  I was living in a bone dry farm whose style cried out for water.  And now I'm easy.  You know how nice it is to do song lyrics?  Of course.  I don't know.  Oh, Jimmy.  I got to play the other side of that.  That's just a dumb, stupid idea.  Of course you do.  Of course it is.  Ridiculous.  You know, I push for the correct legislation for myself. 
[00:18:30]  You know, while we're talking about driving, I was out on Long Island a couple days ago  now and coming back.  The fuck is up with Long Island?  And I've noticed this for many years, but I'm bringing it up again because I do a lot  of the Jersey highways now.  And you don't see the same type of crazy drivers you see, especially on that Northern State Parkway.  Yeah.  The swerving in and out shit and these guys, like, swerving and just missing your... 
[00:19:00]  And I do the same fucking move.  We all do the same fucking move.  But it seems like it happens way more on those Long Island highways, man, where they come,  you know, sweeping in and missing your bumper by, you know, it looks like inches.  Well, I'll...  And then you see the other guy that's chasing him.  Like, it looks like they're just having fucking races out there.  I think there's a few things at play here.  I think the highway's a lot more crowded than they used to be when we were growing up.  And, you know, people are stupid. 
[00:19:30]  They drive like shit.  And people want to get around them.  Right.  And then the other thing is this influx of, I guess, a lot of Hispanics around Long Island.  They tend to drive crazy in pairs and groups.  And they're low to the ground.  Very low.  They're in their little Toyota Corollas that have the spoiler on them.  And they drive like fucking maniacs.  I just notice it a lot more when I go out to Long Island because I'm not out there as often.  So I guess it's more noticeable.  I don't know.  And I was the guy they were cutting off, which pissed me off because I'm like,  I don't think I was the fucking asshole.  Yeah, I'm that guy. 
[00:20:00]  I'm the guy that's supposed to be cutting off people.  I don't give a fuck if I'm cutting people off.  That's fine.  Don't cut me off.  But when they start cutting me off, then I think there's a problem out there.  Exactly.  I honestly think I was going, like, I wasn't flying, but I was going a good 65.  Oh, 65.  65, yeah, that's kind of stuff.  But on Northern State with those fucking turns and the curves, it's a curvy fucking road.  That's what breaks are for.  You know what?  You're in a rush like that, you're rushing right into an accident.  That's what I say.  What the hell do I know?  Jesus, regular Joe.  Always a little tidbit of information and wisdom. 
[00:20:30]  Can we get into this A-Rod thing?  A-Rod.  A-Rod's a son of a fucking bag, huh?  Even the Yankee fans in general don't like A-Rod.  No.  I hate him.  Because he stinks.  Because he chokes.  I don't care if he's a child molester in the offseason.  If he bats 350 in the playoffs, I don't care if he's a fucking diaper raider.  We're in Yankee country, and there's so many Yankees.  Yankees are Yankee fans.  I always fuck that up.  Yankee.  But there's more than one Yankee.  Yankees fan.  Or can't you be the Yankees fans?  They're called the Yankees. 
[00:21:00]  The Yankees.  Yankees fan?  Yankees fan.  People say, though, that it's like, I'm a Yankee fan.  You don't say, I'm a Yankees fan.  I'm a Yankee fan.  What is the proper way?  Yankee.  Now it just sounds funny.  I know most people would say Yankee fan.  Now it just sounds funny when you say it.  Yankee.  It sounds like you're Yankee.  I think you can do either.  Huh?  I think you can do either.  You know what?  I'll say I'm an Oriole fan, but they're not called the Oriole.  Oh, Orioles.  Remember what happened to them?  Hey, he was happy they made it that far up. 
[00:21:30]  Remember?  I can't wait for next season.  Remember?  Ah, you know what?  At least you got the Ravens, right?  At least you got the Ravens.  I got no complaints.  People are wondering because they're trying to make their bets.  I am absolutely going for the 49ers.  Good.  I'm not fucking doing any trickery.  I really want to see the 49ers win.  Anyway.  By the way, there's four people on the fucking Craigslist who tried to order Super Bowl tickets.  What happened?  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  You just said the Ravens and you got me.  They got, they paid like, they were trying to order Super Bowl tickets. 
[00:22:00]  It was over $5,000.  It was almost $6,000 for two Super Bowl tickets.  And they got in the mail.  Wired the money.  They wired the money to Baltimore.  And, oh, it's fucking funny.  I love this.  This makes me sad, man.  Hawaii.  They're going to the game.  Are they going?  They're having dinner with fucking, what's his name?  That buck-toothed asshole from Denver.  Oh, someone took care of him?  Yeah, Elway.  And San Francisco has given them a pair of tickets, too, so they could go with friends.  So they wound up getting more than they ever would have gotten.  It was an East Bay couple. 
[00:22:30]  They were on six grand.  The Osgood family found four seats for sale on Craigslist.  And they went to an individual claiming to be a Ravens season ticket holder.  And it seemed fair, about $5,900.  It's about double the price.  They were willing to pay that.  And they talked the deal out through text and email.  The couple wired the funds across country.  The package arrived, and it contained a printed note that said,  Enjoy the game!  Go Ravens!  LOL.  Oh, my God.  Sharon Osgood said, I'm sick. 
[00:23:00]  Like, physically sick.  She said, all over the envelope, it says,  Go Ravens, too, even on the FedEx label.  So this guy just wanted to rub it in.  I kind of liked it.  I didn't know there was a follow-up to that.  I didn't know there was a follow-up to that.  Yeah, they wound up getting it.  Really?  I think the president, a ticket master, or whatever it is,  stepped up.  Yeah, stepped up with a couple of tickets.  And then San Francisco stepped up with some tickets.  Oh, that's funny.  Speaking of the Super Bowl, I guess Flacco had to apologize for saying retard. 
[00:23:30]  Who's Flacco?  He said it for like a second, and then Mike went,  Oh, wait a minute.  I mean...  Yeah, they asked him about having the Super Bowl in New Jersey next year.  And he said it's retarded.  And he said it's retarded.  There is...  We have talked about this shit on our show forever.  You can say faggot without meaning it in the gay way.  You could say retarded without, like, fucking pointing and laughing at retarded people.  He rock.  What is wrong with this society?  People, it's just an excuse to get upset. 
[00:24:00]  It's not real.  They're being upset.  I don't know the first thing about Flacco, but I could be pretty certain that he wasn't  making fun of retarded people by just...  What was the exact line he said?  He said it's retarded.  I think the idea is retarded.  Yeah, but what was the question again?  Oh, should the Super Bowl be in?  You're having a Super Bowl in a cold-weather environment.  Oh, right.  Oh, as far as New York goes next year.  He's right.  And he goes, yeah, that's just retarded.  He said that's retarded.  Uh, that's...  And anyway, that's...  I think it's retarded.  I probably shouldn't say that.  I think it's stupid.  I shouldn't say that.  It's stupid.  Oh, he said that right away?  Yes.  Like the second retarded came out of his mouth and said, I probably shouldn't say that. 
[00:24:30]  It's stupid.  All right, so that should be the end of it.  Right.  He shouldn't even have to say, maybe I shouldn't have said retarded.  Yeah, but then he had to go yesterday and apologize again.  Oh, it's so stupid.  And he says he has a great relationship with the Special Olympics and everything.  Yeah, then he has to explain himself.  People's actions mean nothing if you say one fucking word.  That means more than any action that you do over the course of your life.  But Ann Coulter had a great explanation for this when she called Obama a retard. 
[00:25:00]  And she was saying how other words were used medically, too, like stupid or he's sick or, you know, he's dumb.  Imbecile.  Imbecile.  All these words.  She had a brilliant explanation for it.  And you know what happened to Ann Coulter, by the way, after all this shit?  Zero.  Oh, yeah.  Even if you guys hate her out there.  She's untouchable.  She doesn't give a fuck and nothing happened to her.  She never backs down.  Nope.  But I can explain why nothing happens to her.  Because she's her own boss.  Yes, that's a big part of it.  Yes.  If you're your own boss, then you can get away with this shit.  But when you work for a company, I know SiriusXM will never come to the table if we get in trouble. 
[00:25:30]  No, they fold.  They'll fucking push us right outside and make sure they eat us nice and good out there.  Yep.  They're not going to protect us.  No way.  But Ann Coulter skated because she's intelligent about it, but she also doesn't have a boss.  These guys are supposed to protect you because they know how this shit goes.  Any day we could get in trouble.  We know that.  We sit here every day knowing that it could be some dumb throwaway thing we don't even think about.  And then you walk down the hall fully expecting these guys to have a game plan, and nope. 
[00:26:00]  No, they'll tell you to shut up.  They'll either fire you or suspend you immediately.  Yeah.  And that'll be the end of it.  That's it.  But anyway, so Flacco had to apologize.  So then yesterday he goes, obviously it was a bad choice of words.  No, it wasn't a bad choice, and he knows that.  Perfect choice of words because it is retarded to fucking play in the cold.  Right.  Did he have to apologize, or did he decide to?  Because there's a difference.  No, he probably asked about it again. 
[00:26:30]  But if he caught himself and said, I shouldn't say that.  No, I think everyone gets so fucking nervous.  Because yesterday was media day, so you know.  Everyone gets so fucking nervous that they're like, I better just start thinking right away, I better apologize.  I bet he got phone calls from his bosses and shit like that, too.  That's like, all right, look, why don't you just, why don't you just, you know how it is here.  Oh, guys, why don't you just, you know.  This sports culture has gotten really pathetic.  Yeah.  Really, you know, I think Jimmy's brought it up on the show a lot.  It's supposed to be like a, you know, a man's world and a men's network like ESPN, and they're just a bunch of fucking pussies. 
[00:27:00]  Such twats.  Yep.  They really are.  And it's reasonless.  It's not like he said something really angry racist or he said, hey, look at that guy.  His baby's a retard.  Like, then I can understand people being upset.  Like, that's kind of vicious.  Sure.  But, yeah, we're not unreasonable.  I understand that part of it.  But we all know in this world, you can say that's retarded. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Stop being a faggot.  And you don't mean any hate behind that.  There's no hate behind that.  It's fucking silly.  Whenever, I swear, whenever I use the word, like, retard or, like, you know, fag or anything like that,  it never even pops in my mind that, oh, what I mean is somebody that's gay, or what I mean is a mentally challenged person.  No, it's whoever the fuck I'm talking about in that context.  Right. 
[00:28:00]  These fucking, all these little fucking words that get people upset now.  It's, oh.  You know, we can go back in time.  We said this was going to happen, that every group was going to get their word.  After the N-word.  We said it.  We said it on the show, like, oh, boy, and that's why these idiots should be fucking, you know, fighting for every word.  But they didn't, because it was the word that affected them.  Yep.  And we said, no, too bad it affects you.  This is going to be a problem.  Everyone's going to want their word, man.  We said all this. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  It started with the N-word, and then what was the next one?  Fag.  No, nigger was first.  Fag was second.  Midget's in there now.  No, midget.  Retard's in there.  Coming in at number three, it's retard.  There was a whole R-word thing with that chick from Glee.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The R-word.  We said at the time, this is bad.  I'm sorry it affects you personally, but everyone has to band together and fight their shit.  The R-word, please.  What else is there?  There's nigger, faggot, midget, retard. 
[00:29:00]  And again, niggers are nasty.  I get that one being a socially totally unacceptable thing.  You can't say that if you're a sports guy.  But midget, faggot, too.  Faggot's a brutal one to say as a sports guy, like, you know, what a faggot that guy's acting.  You couldn't have said that when Cosell was in.  Yeah, that N-word is a weird one, man.  Because when I walk around Manhattan, I swear to you, I can't pass young people, utes, without hearing that.  They throw that around like it's nothing. 
[00:29:30]  A lot of the videos you'll find me posting on Twitter contain the word.  It's amazing.  They're home videos.  They're sex tapes.  But just to be clear, too, I see it across the board.  It's not just black kids.  It's white kids.  It's Hispanic kids.  That word is so fucking popular right now with the youngsters.  It's amazing.  I've never heard it so much in my life than in the last few years. 
[00:30:00]  It's huge.  What about that woman on MSNBC?  You said cracker.  You said right-wing crackers.  Well, you know what?  Who cares?  I don't care either.  But the truth of the matter is, it's a little hypocritical.  Did she have to say she was sorry?  Crazy crackers.  They don't apologize on MSNBC.  I don't care.  I don't either.  This is not a word that's going to bother me.  Nope.  Personally.  But hey, if you're going to fucking call out people on that, on words, especially MSNBC. 
[00:30:30]  But that's in 05-06.  The death now for Republicans is the tone of this conversation.  You could go to like halfway, maybe.  We had evangelical Latinos wanting to meet with Howard Dean at the DNC.  It's not that long.  Because, I mean, I'm just saying, like, that's a shift, right?  It's not the beginning to a bad joke.  Is this it?  Yeah.  It happened in the world.  And point being, I mean, and we saw in droves, you know, the Latino community moving over to  the Democratic Party largely because of the tone.  And you had even Republicans in the Republican Party who were Latino just disgusted with the 
[00:31:00]  tone.  So these guys have to be very, very careful.  And the other thing that these guys know is that those, you know, crazy crackers on the  right, like, if they start with their very hateful language, that is going to kill them.  Wow, you can't say it in that context.  I know.  Exactly.  Did you hear that?  You stupid broad.  Crazy crackers on the right with their fucking...  You can't say it in that context.  Those crazy kikes start with their derogatory terms.  That's the story here.  You can't say it in that context. 
[00:31:30]  If she just says a throwaway like that, I'd sort of agree with you, but I don't give a  fuck.  I really don't.  But now it just shows how stupid she is.  Now, what is that said?  I guess it's all over the press, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a biggie today?  That was yesterday.  It was kind of a biggie.  But also MSNBC got in trouble for editing another one of their tapes, news tapes, to  make it seem like something was happening that wasn't happening.  There was a father of one of the Newtown kids that was speaking, and he had asked a 
[00:32:00]  question.  He said, why...  He goes, I want somebody to give me an answer.  Why do we need assault weapons?  Why do people need assault weapons?  And then he stopped, and it was silent.  He goes, can anybody give me an answer?  And somebody yelled...  A couple of people yelled out, like, Second Amendment!  Second Amendment!  Right to bear arms!  And they edited it to make it seem like he was talking, and these people just started 
[00:32:30]  heckling him with, Second Amendment!  Right to bear arms!  Without him having asked the question.  What a fucking...  Yes!  And then the story was, heckler...  People...  Gun nuts!  Heckle Newtown victim's father!  Let me tell you, that fucking MSNBC...  They fall, I'm guessing, under NEC.  Yes!  And I want to say, is the guy's name Steve Kappas, the head of the news division over  there?  Not sure.  Whoever is in charge of the news at NBC is really fucking...  A lot of bad shit is happening with their news division.  I don't know how he still has a gig. 
[00:33:00]  How the fuck is he still in there?  The Zimmerman tape editing...  It's so agenda-driven.  Even if it was editing in the fucking...  In favor of views I completely agree with.  You gotta fire somebody for that.  You can't do that shit.  You cannot fucking edit shit like that.  And they did.  They edited it to make it so he wasn't asking a question.  As he was speaking, people started yelling out, out of nowhere, Second Amendment, right  to bear arms.  Do we have the unedited version, or the edited version first? 
[00:33:30]  And a cash kit.  Is that the one?  Let me find it.  All right.  Travis, find it.  Find it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's been a big story.  But MSNBC is just...  And people always say, like, you know, Fox, this, that...  Yeah, okay.  Fox is the one fucking bastion of right-leaning media.  Okay, I get it.  But, man, what they do over at MSNBC is by far a lot more toxic.  Fortunately, no one watches it.  They're all spitting their heads off, man. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  They really are.  But you know what?  I don't see a lot of tape editing going on.  NBC is notorious for that shit.  I watch MSNBC because I love the Lispy broad.  Which one is that?  You haven't heard the Lispy broad yet?  Is she the half-black girl?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I've watched her.  She has a horrendous, like...  Terrible.  Like, S thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She has a very difficult time.  They do the promos.  It just...  It makes me howl.  Yeah.  It really does.  Very difficult time.  It's very Lispy.  Yes. 
[00:34:30]  And I guess we're just supposed to accept that.  Fine.  We'll accept it.  But I can enjoy how silly it is.  Yeah.  Do we have both versions?  Yes.  Okay, great.  But we do have both versions.  Which one do you want first?  I would go with neither.  Edit it.  Myself, but edit it.  Why anybody in this room needs to have one of these assault-style weapons or military weapons?  Okay.  This guy lost his kid?  High-capacity clips.  And not one person can answer that question. 
[00:35:00]  Forgive me.  No.  Sexuality shall not be infringed.  All right.  Infraged.  All right.  Please, please, no comments while Mr. Heslin is speaking.  MSNBC amended the original version to clarify the context.  The original version has been replaced with a fuller version.  So that was...  That's the full version.  Where's the edited version?  So obviously there was a delay.  No one answered.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  And then he said, no one can answer me.  And then they answered.  Yeah.  No one even answered when he was looking for the answer until he actually said, no one  has an answer to that.  And then people are like, no, this is why.  Like, they gave him that courtesy.  Were they heckling him?  No, no.  Not at all.  That was...  That's a tough spot for that father, though, man.  Yeah.  The father, I can't fault.  Here...  No, no.  You can't fault.  Here he loses his son, and then he's in a tough fucking spot, hoping that something...  He could get some kind of comfort.  And he's not going to get any comfort in this situation.  I'm going to have to find something that's not uploaded by NBC. 
[00:36:00]  They're all fucking edited now.  Yeah.  They all show the unedited version now.  They don't show MSNBC's edited fucking version.  It's a tough spot for that father.  Of course.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, the thing is, not even taking it as the father and the people in the audience...  The story here...  Of course that's tragic, and the guy's in a very difficult position.  But the story there is that MSNBC are a bunch of fucking agenda-driven cocksuckers that are willing to completely twist the news around for their own fucking purposes. 
[00:36:30]  You going on Hannity tonight?  No.  Yeah, right.  Well, you know what?  I never watched Hannity and saw him fucking conveniently editing facts out of the tape.  He'll comment on them.  That's terrible.  Fucking terrible, man.  Editing the news, editing stuff like that, just to make it a point.  I do believe MSNBC is running crazy trying to get their edited clip ripped down off of everything. 
[00:37:00]  I'm having a real tough time.  Why would they do that to begin with?  Why would you edit that Zimmerman?  How could anybody in good conscience, like when you're a news person, knowing you're changing the context, how could you do that?  Because it's fucking perfect, because when they use the headline, gun nuts, heckle, new town father, dead kid's father, of course, it's perfect for what they want. 
[00:37:30]  They love these gun control people.  They love the liberals.  They love the Democrats.  They're their vehicle.  So if it gives them the chance to advance that agenda, they're going to edit news.  And nobody gets, this is what's interesting, that people get their advertisers protested for saying offensive jokes or they say retards.  This is where you should protest advertisers when a news organization is editing.  And hey, if Fox does it, then go after Fox too. 
[00:38:00]  If they edit clips to change the meaning of a clip and pass it off as news, any news organization that does that should be fucking protested.  Yeah.  Instead of going after them for jokes.  Is that it?  Jesse Lewis was my son.  He was a victim in Sandy Hawk.  He was my son.  He was my buddy.  He was my best friend.  Oh, this poor bastard.  Jesus.  I never thought I'd be here speaking like this.  Oh, boy.  Asking for changes on my son's behalf. 
[00:38:30]  And I never thought I'd be laying up to rest.  The happiest day in my life was the day he was born.  Oh, jeez.  He's my only son.  My only family.  And the worst day of my life was the day I had when this happened and I buried him.  For me, it shall not be a rest.  All right.  Haslam, please continue. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's so out of context.  We're not living in the Wild West.  They went...  That's how they edited it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They went from him standing to him sitting.  Yes.  Wow.  Ed Wood fucking edited that.  Ah.  Perfect.  A man would sometimes just sit without anybody noticing.  I thought the other thing wasn't as big of a deal when there was a pause.  Yeah.  And no one answered.  So I'm thinking, okay, they could sort of, like, explain that a little bit.  But what we just saw, wow.  They have that heart. 
[00:39:30]  It's completely different.  The heart-wrenching part where he's had the portrait of him and his son.  He's talking about something that's inconceivable.  Horrific.  And then they edit right back to where he's sitting.  And everyone's fucking...  Right after he had asked the question.  Wow.  And it looks like they're heckling it.  That's horrendous.  It's just a bunch of fucking cocks over there.  They're taking this guy's grief.  And they are absolutely capitalizing on it.  Oh, they're pigs.  They are fucking... 
[00:40:00]  They're fucking pigs.  They're taking his...  Yeah, you're right.  They're grief.  And they're turning into something much different.  How about all the dummy...  I mean, the original clip is brutal.  Yeah.  So why do they feel like they had to fucking do that?  Because they want to be able to say, look at these gun nuts heckling this poor man.  But even the original clip is, you know, with the gun guys, you know...  But at least they get asked.  Right.  You know?  Wow, that's brutal.  Yeah, that was a bad one.  Yeah.  Wow, look at this piece of ass in CNN.  In through Atlanta. 
[00:40:30]  We're going to get a little bit of daytime heating.  And we'll start to see these slums wrap up.  Which is hard to believe.  Who with the yellow thing under the pillow?  And then as we go through the evening hours, we're still...  Holy shit.  She's a new weather girl on CNN, huh?  Boy, where the fuck they picked these girls up?  That's fucked.  They just...  That's what we want to share with you.  This is a mobile home park.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, wow.  Good figure.  Then they have to go back to the front.  We got sisters.  It's already here.  Yeah, that's a bad clip.  A-Rod, anyway.  So what's going on with A-Rod? 
[00:41:00]  Most Yankee fans don't like the A-Rod.  I don't come across many people that are rah-rah about A-Rod.  He's a choke artist.  And what?  He's...  Terrible.  Travis, what do you know about this?  More steroid shit or more banned substances?  Yeah, he's being accused.  There was a new report yesterday in a Miami newspaper that he purchased, you know, banned  substances, PEDs, from 2009 to 2012, which is a little later than he says. 
[00:41:30]  He only did it from 2001 to 2003.  See, yeah, yeah.  The Yankees are hoping this is good enough to get them out of that big fucking contract.  I think they owe him $114 million still.  But everything I read is like, you know, all these contracts are worded so specifically  that it would be really tough to do anything.  Right.  I mean, he could get a 50-game suspension if they could, like, prove that...  Does he get paid if he gets a 50-game suspension?  I don't think so.  He's going to be out anyway with his fucking little hip. 
[00:42:00]  Hip injury, yeah.  His little hip injury.  His hip injury.  That's when you hurt your really cool outfit.  Ah, steroids, you know, you want to get big, what do you want to want to...  You know, just eat your vegetables.  What the hell do I know?  These guys...  The mic didn't do it.  These guys take incredible risks because there's so much money involved.  Yeah, and apparently, like...  When you're sitting there and you can, you know, sign a $100 million contract, you'll pretty  much fucking do whatever you have to.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  There's other names involved in this where...  Oh, there's going to be a million names involved.  Jim Norton.  And they've...  If it's one guy, it's...  Most all of them have already been busted for...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon, they were both suspended last year.  Bartolo Colon, he stinks.  That's a good one.  I'm just joshing, folks.  A little wordplay.  Go ahead, Trav.  Wow.  Yeah, and his performance really hasn't been enhanced, has it?  No.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:43:00]  Especially in the playoffs.  That guy fucking stinks.  A chookaroo.  But he denies it, so...  Denies that he stinks?  Yes.  I'm great.  Yeah, fuck him.  Throw him out.  The bum.  And what's going on with Ray Lewis with, like, deer antlers?  I couldn't even understand that one yesterday.  There's some fucking shit he's using that's...  Yeah, deer antlers.  Ah, maybe he needed advice he wrote into the paper.  Deer antlers.  What the hell do I know, right?  Go ahead.  Hey, Ken.  Thanks a bunch. 
[00:43:30]  Nigel and Joe's been really funny today.  Yeah, you know.  I'm just having a good time.  Two more booze and I'll be tied over for the weekend.  How you doing, Ken?  So he's hurt and he's using some deer antler extract spray to recover from his latest injury.  How the fuck do people figure that shit out?  I got an injury and I'm going to grind down some deer antlers and get some kind of spray  out of this.  The difference, though, is that nobody cares about people doing that shit in football.  Like, nobody cares about... 
[00:44:00]  Is it a banned substance in other sports?  Yeah.  Deer antlers?  They've figured out that fucking athletes are doing something with deer antlers?  The deer antler spray that he was using?  Yeah.  I guess there's a lot of fucking testosterone in that or something.  I don't know.  Wait.  How does that work?  Does anyone know?  Like, I don't care.  Deer antler.  Do you squeeze the deer antlers to get the goodness out?  You put it in a juicer?  Do you grind it up?  What do you do?  Grind it up?  Smoke it?  Do you take the...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How do you do it?  You snort it? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  How do you do that?  No, you spray it.  You spray it under your tongue.  But how...  You can't spray deer antlers.  Yeah.  You spray it where?  Under your tongue.  What?  Yeah.  It's crazy.  You're going to take a deer antler to your tongue?  Under your tongue?  It's a spray.  But you can't spray deer antlers.  I'm going to keep going back to that.  I'm going to put some cherry in there.  How do you get deer antlers into a spray form?  Really?  Yeah, you probably grind them up in, like, powder form.  What do I know?  Sprit to spray.  Bad.  Get home.  That one was bad.  Wow.  I can't get out of this.  You know, guys, sometimes you get into one, and you're just hoping that after the break 
[00:45:00]  you'll be back to normal.  I just want to know how they make the spray, and then we can go to break.  I love how they throw this shit around.  That's all I want to know.  But they don't tell you what it is.  I certainly could have done my own research when I saw this story probably 12 hours ago.  Do you think they just grind it up somehow and then liquefy it?  Well, here it is.  It's IGF-1.  Deer antler spray.  It's not pronounced IGF.  It's IGF.  Oh, I'm sorry.  IGF-1.  IGF-1. 
[00:45:30]  Let's see.  Ooh, what is that?  How do you do it?  What do you do?  You spray it.  We know you spray it, but how do you get it to spray form?  You want how it's made to do an episode on deer antler spray?  Yes.  How is it made?  We got a guy in Baltimore.  He might know.  Let's go cold here.  Brian in Baltimore, what do you know on deer antler spray?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Morning.  The deer comes from New Zealand.  It's a special kind of deer.  It has the antlers.  It's like some of the fastest growing organism on the earth or material, you know, on the earth. 
[00:46:00]  So they harvest this crap, and then they powder it up, turn it into a liquid and a pill.  And so you can spray it under your tongue, or you can take pills.  Wouldn't that make your tongue really big?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't it just make your tongue grow?  Well, you know what?  Ray Lewis, the weird thing was that a lot of people during the game, they said that while  everybody else was at the Gatorade thing, he was on his hands and knees just licking Gatorade 
[00:46:30]  up off the grass and peaking up in fear.  And when the starter pistol went off, he ran into the locker room and hid.  Starter pistol?  Yes.  Yes, that's what they do.  I didn't know that.  He wanted something every day.  Yes.  He actually, you know what tipped him off that Ray had a problem?  Is there was a guy in the front wearing a bright orange hat, and Ray went over with  his two front paws.  I was doing a deer.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Poof.  Poof.  Poof.  Wait, so that's, and they throw it under the tongue, and then that makes what?  Well, okay, so.  It has a human growth hormone in it.  Why doesn't your tongue get bigger then?  I don't buy this shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right.  That's some cut-up.  It contains small amounts.  But it is banned in the NFL.  But they don't test for it.  It's banned, but not tested as well.  Why is it banned even?  That's a little loophole, huh?  Hey, Brian, go Niners, right? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Go Niners.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You're in Baltimore.  I'm a Redskins fan, though.  Oh, you don't give a fuck?  All right, Brian.  Later, guys.  Thanks.  So the spray and the pills contain small amounts of the deer IGF-1, which is what the liver  converts HGH into.  But why is that stuff banned?  Because it's artificially enhancing your muscle regeneration.  Let me ask you something.  Why not let these fucking guys take whatever they want?  What are they beating?  That's the thing in the NFL.  Nobody gives a shit. 
[00:48:00]  Nobody cares.  But wouldn't it make it so much better for us, the sports fan?  I don't give a fuck if these guys hit 800-foot home runs.  I want to see monsters.  They don't die when they're 45.  Who gives a fuck?  Football should have monsters on the field.  They have monsters.  They do.  Yeah.  Football's in trouble because these guys are getting way too big for the sport.  That's what it's supposed to be.  They're going to have problems, man, if they can't figure out better equipment and stuff.  I'm learning that it's the fur that grows on the antlers.  Yeah.  You know how the antlers have kind of mossy shit?  Furry shit.  Furry shit. 
[00:48:30]  Who the fuck saw deer antler fur?  Who saw antler hair and said, I'll bet that would help with my sore back?  What geniuses people are.  I guess they figure if it grows that quickly that there's some kind of regenerative properties to it.  Why'd they take the stuff that's in a roach's neck?  Or in a fucking centipede tootsies.  This is the toenail of a centipede.  Eat this and your fucking muscles get bigger.  They crawl around all backwards and shit.  Chop you in half.  Goodbye, goodbye.  Take care. 
[00:49:00]  It's been nice being a part of you forever.  Amazing.  Like a roach's neck.  What's in a roach's neck?  They run around for fucking weeks and starve to death without a head.  Yeah.  Amazing.  I believe so.  There's got to be something you can do with that.  Yeah, they're embarrassing, though, because their friends try to talk to them and they're just saying they're with no head.  And they're like, why am I talking to your body?  Let's go to John in Manhattan, home of A-Rod.  That's why there's no cockroach Al-Qaeda.  It's very anticlimactic.  Cut his head off and he walks away and goes home.  He looks up and goes, all right, now what do you want? 
[00:49:30]  Good evening.  Hi, John.  What do you got on this antler shit?  Anything else?  Hi, gentlemen.  Yeah.  It's the IGF-1.  Oh, hold on.  IGF-1.  It's insulin-like growth factor.  All right.  And what it does is pretty much it's a precursor to tell the body to start producing more human growth hormone.  But even that's like regulated.  It's not like you're sticking yourself with juice or human growth hormone.  You can have the same effect if you eat something or have some mother's breast milk, which is delicious. 
[00:50:00]  No, it's not.  Oh, it's good.  No, man.  The aftertaste.  We were just talking about this last night.  The aftertaste is horrendous.  I'll say it again.  I had Pat Duffy's sister's breast milk.  We made ice cream out of it.  It was some of the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had for the first half a second.  And then it was one of the most horrendous things that has ever been in my mouth.  I can't believe you did that.  I can't believe you did that.  Or the baby shit must have. 
[00:50:30]  The two things I can't believe you did.  Look, I step up every once in a while, Jim Norman.  I'm not going to step up every day like the E-Rock and the Troy, but I'll do my things.  I can't comprehend either of those.  I mean, the shit is worse, but the fucking breast milk.  The shit was brutal.  Breast milk.  That's terrible.  It's so gamey to me.  It was incredibly gamey.  It tasted like a horrible armpit.  Like a rotting armpit.  It was dusty.  If that makes sense.  It was sweaty and dusty at the same time.  That's disgusting. 
[00:51:00]  It was horrendous.  Sweaty and dusty.  That's a great show.  I'm doing an appearance.  Sweaty and dusty in the morning.  Sweaty and dusty hour.  Do you guys want to buy some deer antler spray on Amazon?  Hell yeah.  What could it do for me?  And whatever happened to just taking your vitamins and getting a good night's sleep?  Like Hulk said.  Take your vitamins.  Eat your vegetables.  Like I've been talking about my elbow being sore for a while.  It's finally starting to heal.  But do you know how nice a little deer antler juice would have been on there?  It would probably make you feel a lot better.  You know?  A little deer antler juice on there. 
[00:51:30]  That might work, Jimmy.  A little deer juice.  It's only like 30 bucks a bottle.  Oh, but what do you do?  You have to put it under your tongue or can you put it under your actual injury?  No, I don't think that's how it works.  It's not like a cream.  All right.  Rub it in.  Yeah.  John.  You can also take pills.  You're the best, John.  Oh, you.  John.  Enjoy the fog in Manhattan today.  Oh.  Yeah.  What's that?  Enjoy the fog.  Yes, I will enjoy the fog.  All right.  There you go, Johnny. 
[00:52:00]  It's a 10-pill-a-day deer antler program.  Holy shit.  For how long?  I don't know.  What could go wrong?  I see side effects.  Yeah.  Run really fast.  Let me just go to deerantlerspray.org.  May affect your liver or make you skittish.  Imagine your injuries completely yielded.  Yes.  Exactly.  Someone drops a pin and you're freaking out and running down the hall.  Your girlfriend touches you and you're just like, you're just going to jump out the window.  They wake up in the middle of the night.  Ray's bed is empty.  He's on the lawn just peeking around. 
[00:52:30]  How many deer things are you going to name, Jim?  We got the joke.  But deers spend their whole life going, what's that?  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  I'm going to be killed.  What's that?  Ah, someone's trying to get me.  Water.  Bullets.  Water.  Gunhead.  Orange hat.  I smell urine, but I don't trust in water.  It really is.  You think they ever have a moment to just relax?  Never.  Never.  Only around other deers because they all know how delicious they are.  Like, that's all they are.  They're like, I bet you they get together. 
[00:53:00]  I'll bet you their group is probably called themostshootablethingsonearth.org.  If you go to themostshootablethingsonearth.org, it's just a bunch of deers with sad faces.  They're protesting.  How can we make ourselves less shootable?  Yeah, they are shootable.  Holy shit.  Bullet magnets.  Any side effects?  Well, it's beneficial for men suffering from enlarged prostates and watery semen. 
[00:53:30]  It helps.  Watery semen.  Watery semen.  I like watery cum because I shoot it farther.  Yeah, watery cum will go a lot further.  That's another thing that can happen to us.  Watery semen?  What's it do for an enlarged prostate, though?  I don't know.  There's lots of words on this.  Is this really bad for you, though, this thing?  I'm trying to find, like...  It's got to be if it's banned.  I mean, that shit is good for you.  Well, it's banned in sports for a reason because it's a form of HGH.  But it's not... 
[00:54:00]  I mean...  Is HGH that bad, though?  For you?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Seven people were killed in Chicago alone on Saturday.  They had 500 gun deaths in 2012.  No one cares.  What the fuck are the...  What are they doing up there?  They've got, like, a...  I read, what, like 40 people have been killed already?  It's all gang violence.  No one cares.  No one cares.  It's all gang violence.  That's why...  And we've said it a million times.  Why do they keep making gangs?  You would think someone would get the hint after a while and go,  Wow, this is a very dangerous profession, you'd think. 
[00:54:30]  Did you ever see those videos?  We watched those videos of Rick Ross before the shooting happened.  Those guys don't play fucking games, man.  I don't think I was in for that.  Well, you know how did we play gang videos?  Like, you know Rick Ross, the rapper?  Of course.  50 Cent says he set up his own shooting.  Well, we were watching videos of the Gangsta Disciples who, I guess...  He mentioned somebody who he shouldn't have mentioned.  There's just something he did, which, in that world,  they all understand, which I don't. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And those guys do not fuck around.  No.  Oh, so...  This is before the shooting.  Alright, so you think the shooting's based on what you guys played?  Yeah.  Dude, I was watching videos of the Gangsta Disciples from all over the country.  They were showing them from, like, Atlanta and, you know, L.A.  and all these different places.  And they were all saying the same thing to Rick Ross.  They were not pleased with Rick Ross.  Look at this guy.  Mm-hmm.  Can't hear it.  The guy making trigger things behind him? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Period.  Oh, the check.  Wow.  And get your lyrics up.  Nick Mills, everybody, G.  Nothing personal, but tell your boss, man, you got to get that check, boy,  because y'all in trouble.  Oh, it's Maybach.  Oh, it's Rick Ross.  Rick Ross. 
[00:56:00]  You, Rick Ross.  Oh, my God.  Rick Ross, and they're all doing triggers.  Oh, my God.  Triggers.  That was easy to look at.  It's the other shit they do with their fingers.  You never want to see that in person.  And didn't they say something like Maybach and somebody else?  I'm guessing that's the musician or...  It's his label.  It's his label, and they said nothing personal, G, but...  Cut us a check.  Why do they want a check?  He said something about a guy...  Oh, wow.  He mentioned...  He referenced one of...  It's almost like, you know, you referenced John Goddew, you referenced...  He referenced, I think, the guy who started that group, or that gang. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  The Lords?  The Lords.  I'm not going to believe anything you say, Sam Roberts.  Sorry.  Why?  Because you believe in wrestling.  Where'd you get that from?  From your latest video, so I'm not going to listen to you today.  That's fair.  All right, so shut up.  Should I say it anyway, or...?  Yeah, but I'm not going to believe you.  Okay.  What is it?  You believe in fantasy shit.  Well, according to the rap world...  Yeah, he shouted out the leader of the gang, but he also... 
[00:57:00]  Apparently, a lot of these gangs get rappers to pay when they are in their town, you know  what I mean?  Really?  Like, they're like, yeah, you can pretend you're a gangster, but you have to pay the  actual gangsters.  Wow!  Wait, we mean pretend you're a gangster.  They mean you can roll into town, badass...  Right, and acting like you're a real gangster.  And we won't treat you like you're a real gang coming in.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, the way if a real gangster was coming in, they'd be like, this is our territory,  we're going to kill you.  Oh, my God, so you gotta fucking pay them. 
[00:57:30]  You're supposed to pay the gangsters.  That fucking rap world, man, is so foreign to me.  Ha ha, exactly.  Thank God.  Yeah.  I don't want anything to do with it.  It's crazy.  That is fucking...  So, is that what that's about?  Like, a lot of that?  Like, because these guys...  Like, if you're a rapper, like, who's a rapper that has no gangster...  Ja Rule.  Does Ja Rule?  No, he doesn't anymore.  But do any of them not act like gangsters that wouldn't have to...  Will Smith.  Yeah, it's going to be like Will Smith.  What about, like, Snoop? 
[00:58:00]  Snoop would probably have to pay, because he always talks about wrong...  Yeah.  No, but just go to those neighborhoods where those guys are.  No, no, no, no.  I know Snoop's history.  That's not my point here.  Snoop has changed his life, so is he out of that world officially?  Okay.  Ah, B, you can't be out of the life.  What if he's rapping about a fucking burrito or whatever the fuck it is?  Ah, a burrito.  What, was it a burrito?  No, it's...  Hot Pockets?  Hot Pockets.  Okay.  These niggas want some of my Hot Pocket money.  You can't leave the world or the world can't leave you. 
[00:58:30]  They always say these things that, I guess, make perfect sense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I...  Okay, so that's part of what it is.  So, like, you can't shout out the leader of a gang and also be in their town.  Right.  And not him.  See, that's...  But these rappers, like, when they get as big as Rick Ross, sometimes will be like,  fuck you, I'm Rick Ross.  I'm a lot bigger than you, motherfucker, now.  And they're like, uh-uh.  So, what are you hearing about this shooting?  Well, 50 Cent's tweets on it have been hilarious.  50 Cent, I just started following him since he was on our show. 
[00:59:00]  He's a great one to follow on Twitter, man.  He said...  He don't give a fuck.  Somebody tweeted him and said, did Ricky get shot?  And 50 said, no.  Oh, so people fired some shots in the air and Rick Ross drove into a building.  Wait, none of the shots hit the car?  I think they did.  That's hilarious.  I think the shots did hit the car.  Back of the car, though?  I think what I saw, I think they were all across the side and everything.  It looked legit to me, but, you know, to me.  50 Cent, all right.  But 50 Cent, what do you know?  He was telling me he was faking. 
[00:59:30]  I need to know this.  Do you have Menino audio or what?  Oh, yeah.  Can we do that now?  Nice.  Yes, I gotta hear this.  Or is it gonna be disappointing?  No, it's good, and I got...  I don't know if you guys want to do it, but it was back there, and I have transcripts  of all the clips I'm going to give you, and I thought we might want to see if Roland  or Mayor Menino was easier to understand.  Oh.  Wow, okay.  If Roland's reading these transcripts cold.  The same way Menino obviously is, because nobody can practice that.  All right, that's not a bad idea. 
[01:00:00]  I like it.  I love Menino.  So why don't we take a break, and we'll do some Menino clips.  He did, what, a State of the...  State of the City.  State of the City thing yet last night?  Now, Bobston, Bobston, Bobston, the State of the City is sound.  Did he say that?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We'll break here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Do they play this on the rooftop? 
[01:00:30]  They did this five times.  On the rooftop?  Yeah.  Why?  They didn't get it right the first time?  I don't know.  There's just five different versions of this.  Yeah.  44 years ago.  Oh.  The last time they performed on that rooftop, right?  E-Rock.  Top of Apple Records. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Beatles performed in public for the last time 44 years ago.  They were only a bad for how many years?  Seven or so.  Yeah.  Pretty fucking amazing.  It really is.  We just did seven years in our sleep.  Seven yards.  Seven yards.  Seven yards.  What's everyone doing at the Super Bowl?  I have nothing to do.  Yeah, I don't know.  I wanted to go to Vegas for this Jose Aldo-Frankie Edgar fight.  I wanted to fly out.  It's Saturday night.  Why don't you? 
[01:01:30]  Because, again, I want to shoot something, so I've got to be on stage every night.  I can't fuck around.  I take time off.  You're right.  That's the way you need, Jim.  Why don't you get some time out in Vegas?  Find a room.  That's when the fight is anyway.  That's going to be a good fucking pay-per-view.  And the fights on Fox, and we talked about it on the show, they were great.  Yeah.  I loved them.  Alistair Overeem is fighting on this one again.  I think Aldo.  Not Rampage.  Oh, you said Aldo Nova?  Aldo Nova.  Aldo Nova.  He's going to come into the octagon with Fantasy playing. 
[01:02:00]  Fantasy.  And who's fighting?  Oh, Rashad.  Rashad Evans.  Rashad Evans is fighting again.  Nice.  Got to go with Rashad, right?  I love him.  We go with all the guys that come on our show.  Yes.  That's how I pick my fights, by the way.  Because everyone's like, why are you picking Rampage?  Because we know them.  That's why.  Simple as that.  No logic behind it.  You come in here, you're nice to us, and you shake my hand, maybe take a little picture,  I'm all for you.  That's it.  You're a good guy.  That's right.  That's how I pick my UFC fights. 
[01:02:30]  I watched The Ultimate Fighter last night, the new one.  With Shane?  It's good with Chell, I mean, sorry.  Yeah, and Jon Jones.  It's really good.  Chell Sonnen and Jon Jones, yes.  Yeah, it's great.  I don't know why I said Shane.  I'm debating going out there just to fucking...  You should.  Although, you know, watching on pay-per-view is just as good.  Yeah, I got to do material.  I got to do sets.  If I want to shoot something, I got to be ready.  Ooh.  Something that didn't need to be said emphatically at all that I just said, because no one cared,  but I stressed it like you were arguing.  I hear you.  It's an old trick I do.  I just can't.  I got to do this.  And you're like, all right, we get it.  Who was asking? 
[01:03:00]  Exactly.  So I don't know what's happening for the old Super Bowl.  I have nothing to do.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, what am I supposed to do?  I was going to...  I mean, you know, I got an invitation from Travis's wife.  Texted me.  Well, they're coming over my house.  That's where she invited me.  Exactly.  She said, hey, a bunch of us are going to be at the party.  Party.  Thing.  Hope to see you.  I have a new television coming for the living room.  Just for the Super Bowl?  Well, I wanted to get it anyway, but I'm having it expedited so it's in and ready to go by Super Bowl. 
[01:03:30]  How big?  80.  It's the 90-inch.  Wow, really?  How do you not love this fucking giant child?  I rule.  That's so great, dude.  90-inch.  How big is the one you got now?  The one I have now is like fucking 60, if that.  I got a 62, 63 in my living room, and all of a sudden, already I'm like, no, I got to go 
[01:04:00]  bigger.  Oh, you want to go bigger?  This one's going to take up the entire wall over there where my TV is now between the two  doors to the office.  It will go molding to molding.  I'm like fucking huge.  That whole wall's going to be a TV.  I remember it was only a few years ago.  Time Warner was bragging about their 100-inch TV, and it was something like, they only had  like 10 in the world at the time.  Yeah.  It was like 100 grand.  No, it might have even been way over 100 grand.  And everyone's sitting there like, holy fuck.  And a mere few years later, now a lot of, you could, it's affordable for a lot of people 
[01:04:30]  to get the 90-inch TV.  Active 3D, so you get the fucking glasses, the active glasses, and fucking see some crazy  3D.  How do they figure out how to produce those things efficiently?  Because, you know, they didn't make a lot of them because they didn't know how to ship  them, basically, was what they were telling me at the time.  Yeah.  Without breaking them.  Oh, yeah, right?  Yeah.  Let me ask you with this giant TV, because I have, I'm switching my furniture a little  bit, so I'm putting my sofa on the other side. 
[01:05:00]  I'm putting my TV, whatever.  Fascinating.  I'm going to be, yeah, exactly.  That's why I edited myself.  There's going to be, there's going to be less.  Believe me, if I thought people, if I thought I got a moment of eye contact from anyone,  I would have fucking, I would have actually told you how me and Felix measured.  But how close, I'm afraid of being too close to the TV.  Like, at Bobby Kelly's house, it's like, there's a, but you've got a huge living room  and you've got a fucking Coliseum living room.  I have a regular size living room.  I don't want to be too close.  I've actually thought, I have a 50 inch, I've actually thought of going smaller.  Wow, really? 
[01:05:30]  But I'm not going to.  No, no, no.  I don't want to be too close to her eyes.  Don't ever go smaller.  My eyes.  Have they figured out the technology where we're not fucking radiating our fucking bodies?  Who gives a shit?  If it looks good, it radiate me.  Yeah.  What's that?  That's the 90 inch?  Yeah.  That's the 90 inch.  That's obscene.  It is fucking crazy big.  Is it more than 10 Gs?  Yeah, just about.  Oh, that's not bad.  That's nothing, actually, compared to what it used to be.  Then you've got to get the receiver and everything like that, the 3D.  My TV is surely smaller than your picture in a picture. 
[01:06:00]  Your house is surely smaller than his fucking TV.  Picture in picture is bigger than my television.  Yeah, but you do it to yourself.  Yeah.  You do.  You really do it to yourself.  You could have gotten a bigger TV.  I'll say it again, we've said that a lot, too, on the show.  Even when I was fucking poor, I made sure I had a nice fucking TV.  Right.  I put a lot of, most of my money into my fucking TV.  What was your good TV?  It was a fucking tube, right?  The last, remember?  Oh, that was great.  God, the tube TV.  That's so old school now.  Yes.  The picture on that was great.  That was the one, I told the story where the animals rolled it into my apartment. 
[01:06:30]  And I just sat there like a pussy going, oh, I guess this is how they do it.  I remember that.  Because it weighed, I don't know, we lifted that thing a bunch of times over the years.  Those fucking old tube TVs.  It had to be 200, I would guess it was 250 pounds.  Because you wanted a big, you wanted a big TV back then.  And like even 30.  We're not talking back then.  We're talking, this was six, seven years ago.  Yeah, I know.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, seven years, probably.  We're talking even 30 something inch, 36 inch TV, the tube TVs.  We're like.  No, this was 40, I almost remember, 40 something. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  I remember.  Yeah.  Those were so fucking heavy.  They were ridiculously heavy.  You couldn't fucking, you needed like two people.  And these two guys came, they were like, obviously two, you know, old athletes that, you know,  their time has passed them by.  And now they're delivering these monster fucking heavy TVs at the time.  And they rolled it into my apartment in a box.  Unbelievable.  And I didn't say shit, man.  It's like, yeah, we plug it in.  If it works, fuck it.  Right.  Fuck it.  Wow.  If I knew I could take them, I would have said shit. 
[01:07:30]  That's how this works, by the way.  That's how the world works.  I love when people call us out.  Yeah.  I shut my mouth because I didn't think I could take the person.  But if you know you could take the person, then you're going to get lippy.  Yeah.  That's how we all act.  Exactly.  Every single one of us.  I actually don't a lot of times yell at old people or I catch myself not doing it.  Even if they deserve it?  Nah, I mean...  There are times when you...  I don't give a fuck how old you are.  You deserve it.  I'm like, would I yell if this was some six foot five dude?  No. 
[01:08:00]  So I won't yell at an old person because I can't be a fucking pussy and bully an old person  or bully someone small.  If I wouldn't say it to someone who's six foot five, a lot of times I shut up and I don't  say it to fucking an old person.  But that goes against nature.  That's how nature works.  If you feel like you could take the person, yeah, you're going to be a fucking, you know,  a bit aggressive and intimidating.  That's just how it works.  Old people, though, yeah.  I got trouble really laying into them.  That's for sure.  I feel bad for them.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Got you a little fucking old fossil.  Get out of here.  I'm not talking about the old people that are...  It's obvious you should just...  Like they're all busted down.  No, I'm not talking about those people.  Yeah, you're talking about like what?  Like fucking...  You never ran into a guy that has old man strength?  The old man strength.  Holy fuck.  Epic beard guy.  Epic beard guy.  Yeah, he was fucking cray.  Let's do some Menino, huh?  Damn.  Yeah, let's check out some Menino.  Boston has the greatest mayor ever.  We love making fun of our mayor down here in New York City, but...  Yeah.  Boston has the number one mayor in the world. 
[01:09:00]  Mayor Menino.  So he did a state of the city, I guess they call it.  State of the city.  He gets up there and lets everybody know what a great job he's been doing.  Right.  Yeah.  How is the state of Boston?  I don't know.  Is it good?  I'll let you know when I get up there.  Ow!  Ow!  Sweet!  Oh no, I forgot about that.  Thank God.  So we should just, uh, let's just get right into this. 
[01:09:30]  Menino talking and babbling.  I am forever grateful.  What?  It starts off great.  I am ram.  I am ram.  Hey, am ram.  Am ram.  I am forever grateful to my wife Angela.  Oh, did you see her?  I ruined that trip.  But she still hasn't kicked me out.  She stood by me. 
[01:10:00]  And I say, like she, always has.  Always has what?  I don't know.  Stood by him?  I heard shitty in there.  I mean, I have the transcript, so it's not fair for me.  What's shitty?  She stood by me.  Shitty.  And the shitty.  What's shitty?  I think the shitty of Boston.  Right.  She's wiping up his shit?  His shitty.  His shitty Boston.  Shitty.  By the way, we don't have time to go to this guy, I guess, unless you want to really fast.  Rob in Jersey. 
[01:10:30]  We were talking about old tube TVs.  Uh-huh.  He lifted one because he wanted to replace it, and he had an activism.  Jesus.  Poor bastard.  Should we go to him for a second?  Terrible.  Rob.  Yeah.  What the fuck happened, man?  I had one of those, like, 35-inch Sonys, like, the thing that's, like, you know, I don't  know.  Heavy.  Four feet.  And I had it up on my TV stand, and it died.  So I went, I got a flat screen, and then I'm trying to take it off the stand, and it 
[01:11:00]  was so goddamn heavy that when I put it down and I stood up, I was like, ah, jeez.  And I thought, like, I just got, like, a strained muscle.  Well, turns out a week later, my aneurysm ruptured, and I had to go and have fucking brain  surgery.  Holy fuck.  Jesus.  That's crazy.  Those fucking things.  Yeah, pretty bad.  You all right now?  Yeah, it was about five years ago.  You know, I, uh, I screwed with a lot of people, though. 
[01:11:30]  Like, when I was in the hospital, like, uh, people, like, were friends who would call  me, and then, you know, I would pick up the phone and go, hello?  Oh, you bastard.  That's terrible.  Kind of funny, though.  All right, Rob.  Thank you, brother.  Yeah, I don't know how they dealt with those fucking heavy TVs.  That must have been a nightmare for all these companies.  That's terrible.  All right.  Back to, uh, Boston, uh, Mayor Mennino.  In a city, like she, always has.  I'm grateful for my doctors, the nurses, the therapists, and hospital staff. 
[01:12:00]  Man, do they do a good job.  They did a fabulous job.  Man.  I was an easy patient, let me tell you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The more good-natured it is, the happier it makes me.  It was just, that was fun, though. 
[01:12:30]  He's, you know, he's, he's joshing.  He is fun-loving.  Nothing better than a good joshing.  Wow.  All right.  I'm grateful to our public servants.  They didn't see the spotlight, they didn't miss beat.  What?  I'm especially grateful for all of the visitors.  Wait, what did he say?  They didn't miss a beat.  Oh.  You tried to say that.  Yes, they didn't miss a beat.  I thought it was like minced meat.  Minced meat.  Yeah.  He missed a beat in the sentence, they didn't miss a beat. 
[01:13:00]  That's right.  Yes, he did.  They didn't miss a beat.  I'm especially grateful for all of the visitors, the prayers, and the hundreds of cars and well-wishers.  Cars.  They afforded day after day.  Cars.  Cars?  Cars?  I'm just trying to be a cod.  Oh, God.  I can't tell you how humble I am and how lucky I feel.  I don't need fancy words to say this. 
[01:13:30]  Fancy words?  I don't need fancy...  You'll pull me through.  I don't need fancy words.  You couldn't, if you tried, come up with fancy words for anything, sir.  Man.  Hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs have come to the Innovation District.  What?  PayPal.  You guys who do it online, you know what?  You guys who do it online, you know what? 
[01:14:00]  I don't know what happened there.  I don't either.  What happened there, you think?  Great.  He's talking about himself a little bit.  He's talking about PayPal.  Yeah, PayPal.  You decided to go off script a little bit.  I didn't quite know how to finish that old sentence.  Oh, man.  Hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs have come to the Innovation District. 
[01:14:30]  PayPal.  PayPal.  You guys who do it online, you know what?  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's along the greenway.  I don't know what he's saying.  Oh, my God.  I just can't wrap my head around the fact that...  I think he's dyslexic.  I think he's dyslexic.  Oh, fine.  There's a lot of people like that.  But how are you the mayor of a big, huge fucking city? 
[01:15:00]  I can't wrap my head around this.  Even the dyslexic thing doesn't totally clear it up.  Right.  Because I read the transcript.  Right.  And where he messes up a lot are in his ad-libs.  So it's not like he's reading the teleprompter and screwing up the words.  Half of them are ad-libs.  He tries to go off script.  Okay.  Maybe he just gets so confused.  He gets confused.  He's an easily confused man.  Oh, wow.  He just completely lost that.  Let me go back.  Somewhere around here, I think.  You guys who do it online, you know what? 
[01:15:30]  It's coming is along the greenway.  Converse is coming to Lovejoy Wharf.  A new balance is expanding and brightening.  And digital companies are making downtown the new home.  Innovation is raising our game.  Not just on our waterfront, but across our city.  In our neighborhoods, where I'm making investments,  keep Boston a livable city for families. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  By the way, I know what's going on.  Wow.  He has a series of mini strokes every time he talks.  Oh, my God.  Holy mackerel.  He's totally unprepared for the sentence he's about to say.  He said the sentence was,  New Balance is expanding.  I believe what meant the New Balance store is expanding.  But he said, New Balance is expanding.  He didn't know what that means.  No.  He doesn't know New Balance is a company. 
[01:16:30]  He thought there was balance that is new.  It's just amazing.  When you're a politician, you've got to be able to speak to your people.  Apparently not.  Apparently not is right.  Uncertainty around the globe and gridlock and washing create real challenges.  Gridlock and washing?  Uncertainty around the globe.  Oh, uncertainty.  And gridlock around washing.  Everybody's trying to bathe at the same time. 
[01:17:00]  And there's just all this gridlock.  And he's a new washing machine?  Yeah.  Gridlock washing.  No hot water for anybody.  Oh, man.  Uncertainty around the globe and gridlock in Washington create real challenges.  We shouldn't excuse Washington for their actions.  But neither should we make them an excuse for our inaction.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That made no sense.  I love the realization for me. 
[01:17:30]  Like, what?  But neither should it.  What?  Let me hear this again.  Oh, you want to hear that part again?  Yeah, I got to hear.  I don't even know how far to go back because it's such a mess.  Go somewhere in here, I guess.  We shouldn't excuse Washington for their actions.  But neither should we make them an excuse for our inaction.  We shouldn't focus on our inability of others to get things done right. 
[01:18:00]  Our inability of others.  By the abilities of people here in Boston.  Our human potential is enough to power Boston's growth.  Here we must have the courage and the creativity of the nation.  Holy shit, is he a disaster.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  Oh my god, a disaster.  Holy fuck.  He adds little sentences into the beginning.  He adds little words into the beginning of sentences.  Yeah.  And then once he gets to the end of the sentence, he realized that that word doesn't make sense. 
[01:18:30]  So he loses confidence.  Yeah, this is a guy who just completely loses confidence.  At the end of every sentence.  So you would think after all these years, they would just accept, oh, here's the lispy one,  by the way.  Gives us a vision of the promised land.  He says, I've been to the mountaintop, and I've looked over, and I've seen the promised  land, and we may not, I may not get there.  Oh, she's talking about the Price is Right game.  Oh, right.  That's from earlier.  The guy.  Leo, Leo, Leo.  Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo. 
[01:19:00]  Don't you think at this point, they could just have an understanding and go, look, I'm the  mayor, but this guy definitely speaks much better than I.  He's been there six terms, right?  We've been out of Boston since 98.  He was the mayor when we were there.  This is his 20th year.  20th year, okay.  I didn't know how many years.  So at this point, everyone would accept, okay, we know he doesn't speak well, so this  guy's going to do this shit for him.  Or in 20 years, learn to speak.  Right.  Something.  Enough to power Boston's growth.  Even we must have the courage and the creativity to unleash it. 
[01:19:30]  Others can help us get better.  But only we can make us great.  Hold on.  What?  He tries so hard to believe that he's a good speaker.  Right.  Because he does the inflection things.  Right.  And we, here in Boston, think we will be a great people.  Like he does the inflection, but the speech itself is a disaster. 
[01:20:00]  I think a speech therapist got to him and is giving him some little, like, tricks.  Yeah, tricks to cover up.  If you're maybe talking some kind of, like, rhythm or cadence or something.  Trick them with your inflection.  Right.  Something.  Lost, yeah!  He starts off strong.  Then it just falls apart.  Yeah.  It disintegrates.  One year ago, I appointed, perhaps, the most impressive group of Bostonians who ever worked on any project in our city. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  So far, so good.  They met with educating experts.  Educating.  Then they're educating experts.  Uncle Jed, I'm going to be an educating expert.  Well, no, he was doing all right.  And then it just, the wheels fall off every single time.  Educating?  Educating experts.  I don't think he got the, all right, let me hear that again.  Project in our city.  They met with educating experts.  Diversity experts. 
[01:21:00]  Above all, thousands of kids experts.  Our parents.  Yeah.  Please join me in recognizing our external advisory committee on school choice.  Will you stand up your hands?  Yeah.  Stand up in here.  Stand up in here.  Stand up in here.  It's just part of, it's like Giuliani's list.  Although with him, it's hard to understand what he's actually saying.  But I guess they're just so used to it.  Oh, Giuliani with the list, though.  You knew what he was saying.  What?  This is a whole nother world.  Yeah.  Maybe the speech writer's just a complete asshole, and that's exactly how it's written down. 
[01:21:30]  That's the verbatim, yeah.  Right.  He's just saying it.  Verbaltum.  In 2013, we'll also make Boston the premier city for working woman.  Working woman.  Yeah.  He said working woman?  For working woman.  He did say that.  He said working woman.  There's one woman.  She's working.  Right near the end, he kind of realized it, and I think he was trying to throw that E in.  Woman.  Yeah.  In 2013, we'll also make Boston the premier city for working woman. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am surrounded by strong women, starting with Angela, Susan, Lisa, and especially my granddaughters.  They are very strong.  Oh, they are very strong. 
[01:22:30]  Stand up.  Stand up.  My cabin includes many remarkable women.  His cabin includes many remarkable women.  I think all of us have said woman instead of women.  No.  No, I haven't.  Maybe once.  My point is, once in your life, or here or there, but to have the same mistake over and  over again.  Three times over the course of three sentences.  One is singular, one is plural.  How hard is that?  I don't know.  My cabin includes many remarkable women. 
[01:23:00]  Woman.  Holy shit, that was a good one.  My cabin includes many remarkable women.  His cabin?  Some I have known for years.  His cabin.  Others have joined us more recently.  I didn't find any of them in binders.  Whoa.  Look out.  Watch out.  A little jab at Romney, I believe that was.  Or was it?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  That Romney guy.  Yeah.  Who hasn't tweeted since the election, by the way.  Take that, Republican.  He's done with Twitter.  He cares.  He's done with Twitter.  Wow.  He's had it.  Who do you think Romney is?  You think he's growing a beard.  He's rich.  He's just having fun.  I like to think he hasn't cut his nails or his facial hair in a couple months now.  I don't know.  Let's get through this.  Menino talks about job preparation.  Mm-hmm.  The most powerful way to leash a person's talent is to prepare them for a job. 
[01:24:00]  We have many programs and places that do this work.  Okay.  But we can do more.  Uh-huh.  So first we're good.  I believe Boston's Center for Youth and Families can be the key.  Okay.  We'll help update our neighbors' skills in our community centers, too.  As a first step, I'm pleased to announce a pilot with Harvard and MIT EdX that will bring  free courses to community centers. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  Oh, man.  All right.  He sort of got through that one.  He sort of.  It was stumbling.  That's the best he's going to sound right there.  That last sentence, he was like, uh.  I just fall apart.  I hope they clap soon.  Yeah, he got through it.  Yeah.  We also have to say, there's enough of enough in our own neighborhoods.  Two weeks ago, Boston Police joined federal and state partners to sweep 27 criminals off  the streets of the Bowdoin-Genebra community. 
[01:25:00]  The cooperation of these public safety officials is matched only by the commitment of the good  people who live in that neighborhood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am pleased to announce tonight that that task force will extend its work for the rest  of the year.  Those who bring guns and drugs into our neighborhoods should know we will bring you to justice.  Oh, wow.  Not so bad.  Probably very scared. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  We've been playing so many of his clips that we just accept that now.  Now, that's fine.  We accept that as a good one.  That was perfect enunciation.  For him, that was great.  For him, yeah.  A plus for that one.  Oh, yeah.  Enough's enough.  Right.  Enough's enough.  And finally, Mayor Menino loves Boston.  This is the era of the city.  Yeah.  You're the era of the city.  The things that make cities great are greatest is its people.  That diverse, skilled crowd of talent. 
[01:26:00]  So, I have never been 20 years more optimistic about our future.  Never?  Never.  All it would take to lead in the next decade, decades after that, is to help each other  reach our full human potential.  What does that even mean?  They don't know when to clap.  They just do it when you see it back off the mic.  It sounds too difficult.  I can say to you with complete confidence.  No, you can't. 
[01:26:30]  That it's not.  That it's complete confidence?  Yeah.  Just pull for each other.  As much as you pulled for me.  I want to thank you all.  Tell the hookers.  Just pull for me.  You know what?  We've heard worse.  Sure.  But still good.  No, there were some in there that were really good.  There were some doozies.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm graped out.  You want some grapes?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I want some grapes.  That was fucking...  No, thank you.  We're all going to eat grapes. 
[01:27:00]  We're going to take a break.  Rich Moss is going to join us next.  Barbiston's people are...  It's number one.  Rehorse.  Sorry.  Charlie, we can pull together and make Barbiston the better city in the world.  Are you hiring females in your cabinet?  Meh, my cabin is full of woman.  Full of woman.  And then he does it two other times. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, Mr. Mayor, you sound like you got a bunch of fucking shit in your mouth or something.  Jesus.  Wow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What are you doing? 
[01:28:00]  What is Ross doing?  What are you doing?  He's dumping protein powder all over his stupid hands, which is making me so happy.  Look at this.  You're supposed to have protein and you're supposed to have protein and you can't get on it.  That's not how you're used to getting it.  Why'd you bring in...  It looks like an eight ball.  Huh?  Why is your protein like that?  It's duty.  Protein powder.  Oh, yeah.  It's like when you work...  I can't get in here.  More of it's on the counter in your hand than in your stupid water bottle. 
[01:28:30]  And how do you know that you...  It's all over your black shirt now.  You're a mess.  Let me see your protein powder, please.  It's a bag of protein powder.  Let me see.  No, because you want to pour it.  What's there to see?  I wanted to see it.  Really?  Like I would do something crazy.  Really?  That's dumb.  Okay.  I want to taste it.  You want to taste it?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Can you pass over?  Or I drill a hole somewhere and I'll...  Can you pass the protein powder over here, please?  I just want to see it and taste it.  It smells like chocolate milk. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  That's because it's brown.  Relax.  Let me see it.  It smells like it.  I'm not letting you see it so you can throw it all over the place.  Really?  Oh, really?  Really?  Really?  Okay.  Really?  All right.  That would be a hack at this point.  What are we doing?  Radio or a true TV show?  Really?  I just want to taste it.  Why can't you trust me?  Why?  Yeah.  And can you pass it over here, please?  I want to just taste it.  He's not going to give it to you.  It's actually pretty good.  It's chocolate.  Can I taste the chocolate protein?  It's still fun.  Put some on paper, okay?  You want some off the table over the chair? 
[01:29:30]  I just want to see the bag of protein.  That is all over here.  You're 55 years old.  It's all over here.  It's a protein powder.  You don't mind that.  I'm glad.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't do the same good.  The guy works out a week and now he doesn't mind.  Fair enough.  I really have been talking a lot of shit since I lost two pounds.  He was telling me to fucking work out his ab regimen.  Well, only because.  Here's why.  Because Selfish was showing his abs.  No, because we said you were looking a little puffy.  So then he has to fucking lift up his shirt and show us his hairy abs again. 
[01:30:00]  He's got abs.  I say abs.  His stupid hairy thorax.  So I haven't done any arm stuff for a month because I hurt my elbow.  So I was just talking about doing abs.  But now my elbow is better.  Watching you eat those grapes is like watching you eat a relative.  That was kind of funny.  No, it wasn't.  I would have laughed.  I'm still early.  I'm still concentrating on my protein.  Can I just see the protein powder?  Can you leave me alone?  I don't do the same bits over and over again.  Sometimes I just want to do like, you know, and taste it here.  Let's see.  All right.  Oh, I'll save you some.  No, I want the whole bag. 
[01:30:30]  You want the whole bag?  Yeah, please.  Oh, really?  Come on.  Stop it.  It's all over the front of his chair, by the way.  It's everywhere.  Oh, it's still pouring all over the fucking place.  On the counter.  Jimmy.  It's just giving you...  What?  Jimmy wasn't paying attention.  I was trying to get his attention.  I don't have to have it now.  I'll do it when I get home.  Jimmy.  Why did I...  Just give me the bag of protein.  Give me the bag of protein.  He didn't for a second think to have a glass of water.  No, no.  He's trying to pour it into that goddamn little water bottle. 
[01:31:00]  And then it'll go in there a lot nicer.  You guys have cups?  How much do you have to put in there?  Now, let him pour.  I want to see how much he can drink.  That stuff is disgusting.  Yeah.  With water?  I need a cup.  Just put it in there and fucking do it.  What's the matter with you?  Don't go in.  It's pouring all over the place.  He's got his paper folded in half and he's funneling it like it's 1975 and he's trying  to fucking get pot onto an album.  Is that the album cover?  Yeah.  The double album.  It's all over. 
[01:31:30]  It's everywhere.  He's like a child.  He has it all over his shirt.  What an absolute boob.  What's wrong with you?  Who brings it in a little plastic bag like that?  You brought fucking a pound of it.  What am I going to do?  That's like in school.  When the kid brought chocolate milk in the little baggie.  He just tickled it.  I went all over again.  It's all over his shirt.  Sam's just dumping it on him.  I'm going to throw it on. 
[01:32:00]  Holy shit.  You have made a mess.  Just to have a little protein in the morning?  It's all over the floor.  And you won't let me see it.  It's on his fucking forearms.  I lost half of it already.  I know.  This is not working out the way out.  This is not working out.  I'm wiping it off for you.  Let him wipe off the protein.  He's wiping off his dick.  Wow.  I haven't had anybody touch my penis like that in months.  Rich had some on his penis, so I was wiping it off.  Go ahead.  Get it off.  Are you done putting the protein in your water bottle?  No, I'm not even close. 
[01:32:30]  Wait, you have to put all of that in there?  Yeah.  That's how much is it?  30 ounce or whatever it is.  That's a lot of protein, isn't it?  Well, you're supposed to have like 30 grams in the morning because if you have protein,  then you don't eat like a bunch of other crap like carbs and all that stuff.  How many calories is the whole thing?  I don't like none.  There's not that many calories.  No sugar.  You know, of course I got to take my fiber stuff because I can't poo.  I mean, I poo too much.  What do you mean you can't poo?  It's just nonstop.  I went to a doctor yesterday for my stomach. 
[01:33:00]  What did he say?  Huh?  What is your fucking anal, your intestinal tract all messed up?  I forgot.  Too much, too much, there's too much cum coating it.  Now.  Really?  Now.  Oh my God!  That's what we think of your protein.  Stupid.  Sam nailed him.  Oh, it's all over Sam too.  Sam got a good hit on that one. 
[01:33:30]  It looks like Count Chocula.  Fuck you in the face.  Nice, Sam.  Good job.  It smells nice and chocolatey in here.  Yeah, it's very nice.  Oh, the chair.  It's going to need a vacuum.  Hey, boss, are we going to a film festival?  Yeah.  Well, not this weekend because I'm at the Stress Factory, but next weekend, Saturday, the 9th,  February 9th, we're at the Athena Film Festival in New York. 
[01:34:00]  Where'd you see it?  It's at the College of Women up there in, up near Columbia.  Let me see here.  University.  But it's the female part.  What?  He wipes it off before I take a picture.  I don't know.  Is that what you were doing?  Why else would I want a photo of you?  What do you think, I'm starstruck?  Let's turn this way.  It's going to look like a great beard.  Turn towards your whole body.  Really, right?  No, I'm getting a shirt.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I love boss. 
[01:34:30]  Boss, can the public go there?  Yes.  It's open to the public.  They gave some free tickets away last night.  All right, so it's the women's college.  No, it's women directors.  No, I know, but it's at Barn, what is it called?  Zenoble?  Barton or Barrett.  It's online at the Athena Film Festival.  Why wouldn't you have the plug?  What's that?  I'm trying to, he doesn't even know I'm trying to help him out.  I know, yeah.  I know you're trying to help me out.  This was supposed to be a quick like, oh, look how I squeezed the plug in for you. 
[01:35:00]  I'm saying go to Athena website, Athena Film Festival.  But it's at the college.  Yes, in New York.  What college?  Athena Film Festival, too.  In New York.  Fucking hilarious.  Call me a whole family.  I think it's called Barton.  It's not Barton.  No?  I don't know either, but I know this much.  It's not called Barton.  Holy shit.  That is not getting cleaned up.  Bar what?  I don't know.  Athena Film Festival, February 9th at 9 o'clock.  Not this weekend.  I'm at the Stress Factory, but the following weekend. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Whatever.  It's going to be a...  You're really bad at doing plugs.  Yes, Rich.  Well, I mean, you know, I don't come in here just for...  I come in here for the car lottery.  I know, but I was from LBR and making it all natural and shit, and now we're like trying  to figure out where it is.  I bet you...  Barnard?  Barnard.  Barnard.  What's it called?  Say it again?  I don't know, because it's not my thing.  Barnard.  Is it a college?  Barnard.  Barnard College.  Barnard.  B-A-R-N-A-R-D.  Yeah.  It's a college.  Barnyard.  Yeah, that's where the females are, and that's why this film of yours, Women Aren't 
[01:36:00]  Funny, is going to be in that film festival.  So if you're in the tri-state area, people are going, well, we want to see the film.  Is it Barnard?  I think that's it.  I think that's the college.  Yeah, I think it's called Barnard.  All right.  We can move on.  I almost cut my finger off last, two weeks ago.  Yeah, what happened?  I saw you tweeting about that.  Holy Jesus.  It wasn't bothersome enough for me to actually pick up the phone.  What happened?  Well, you could...  I was at a red light, and you know how your mechanical seats go back and forth and up 
[01:36:30]  and down?  No.  I stuck my hand between the seat and the door to grab something under the seat I dropped,  and my finger was between the two tracks, and I hit the button, and it came down on  it, just crushing my finger.  Holy fuck.  I could have a lawsuit there.  Wow.  And then I went to hit it again to get it up, and it went down even further.  Did it hurt?  Did it hurt?  I don't have any feeling in the tip of my finger.  Still?  Oh, my God.  When did that one hit your neck?  It matches your head. 
[01:37:00]  So, and I'm at a red light, and the guy behind me...  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down the story a little bit.  How could you do that?  How could you get your finger in the track and have the seat go backwards at the same  time?  No, because the button is right there, and like, as I'm putting...  As my feet's under it, my hand hit it.  Okay.  So, like, your wrist or your forearm hit the button that made your seat go back as your  finger's in the track?  It went down.  Pressing, and it tried.  Right, right.  Wow.  Like, like, like, scissory?  Yeah.  Kind of thing, like that?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting on it like this. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Screaming.  How'd you get out of that situation?  I finally got the seat to pull up, and I pulled my finger out, and it was all flattened and  bloody and stuff, and it was just hard.  Like, the track, you know, goes all along like that.  And my finger's backwards on it, on the thin piece, and it was just crushing it.  Oh, let me see your finger.  If you see it close, it doesn't look good.  Yeah, I want to see it close.  Let's see. 
[01:38:00]  No, get away.  Put it right here.  No, put it on the table.  No, look at your finger, dude.  It's a fucking mess.  No, no, just look at it.  Why are you scared?  Damn it!  What do you have on your finger?  Did you touch it?  No, I don't got any.  I don't have any.  No?  Does he have any?  Put the finger on the table.  Sam, see if he's got your stuff.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  What?  Smell chocolate.  There's only one here.  I don't think I have any left.  All I smell is chocolate protein. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  That chocolate protein, it's everywhere.  Is it bad?  It's bad.  It's funny every time.  It really is.  Anthony's never, ever got the fuck away from me.  Yeah, give him a little bit.  No.  I'm taking it.  No.  I'll just start winging bottles and water and everything.  I am not even fucking dealing with that.  What are they going to be, a salt bottle?  Yes.  Am I a salt bottle?  I'm fucking pepper too, right?  Richie B.  Ah, good one. 
[01:39:00]  Richie B.  Are you guys coming to our film?  Yeah.  We're getting a babysitter and everything.  When is it?  February 9th.  I'm working there.  I'd love to.  Why?  Where are you?  February 9th.  South America.  Do we have to see a lot of films or just your film?  I wouldn't just see ours, honey.  I've never been to a film festival.  So what?  They have a whole bunch of different venues and you just pick where you want to go?  No.  Of course, I'm going to yours.  Everything's based around our film.  There's only one film there.  That's why they call it Film One Us. 
[01:39:30]  I have a film three nights, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  But are there films on the same night as yours?  Why is it so difficult?  Everything's a chore.  I understand the concept of a film festival in general.  Everything's a chore.  But sometimes, I would assume you sit down and then you might be stuck seeing a whole  bunch of shit before they get to yours.  Yeah.  Maybe a couple shorts, a couple, I don't know.  I don't know.  I've never had a movie in a film festival.  I know ours is at 9 o'clock.  But, you know, so maybe there's something else showing at the time. 
[01:40:00]  On campus somewhere else is what I'm thinking.  Okay.  But, you know, I think we'll fill the room.  We bet.  Well, we're not going to fill the room because we don't even know where it is yet.  Well, didn't you guys look it up?  Isn't that Sam's?  Isn't that his job?  That's a barnyard.  There are other films happening.  There's a lot of films.  What college is it officially?  Barnard?  Barnard, yeah.  All right.  And that's where the women go up there at Columbia University, right?  If you go to athenafilmfestival.com, you can get taken.  It's in everything.  All right.  And you have to get tickets for this specifically because there's literally like another movie 
[01:40:30]  playing at the same time.  What other movie's playing at 9 o'clock on Saturday?  February 9th.  February 9th at 9 p.m.  Violetto Went to Heaven.  I heard a rumor that there were misspellings on the poster.  Oh, no.  As we were making a new poster, some guy, a fan, was making us a new poster.  Right.  And it was great.  And we're going to use it.  And he misspelled two words.  Oh, I thought that was you.  No.  That's why everybody was using that.  That would have been hilarious. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, the guy you were using misspelled.  I misspelled two words.  What's two words?  Oh, it's something funny.  Arguably.  Arguably.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Arguably and hilarious.  Arguably.  Arguably.  Arguably.  That's right.  Arguably and hilarious.  Yeah, he spelled wrong.  Yeah.  So.  Did he like Tiger Woods' win?  Yeah.  He did, right?  I mean, it was nice.  I'm going to...  Big deal. 
[01:41:30]  I'm done with it.  You done with golf?  No.  Because of your bad finger?  No, I played in San Antonio.  Your finger stinks.  I can smell it from here.  No.  That's your career.  Wow, that was hurtful.  I know, Rich.  We're being really nice to you today.  We're being extremely nice to you today.  Trying.  Oh, you're on our best behavior.  Yeah.  And you had to do that to Jimmy?  There's not enough protein powder in that water.  I know.  It's how you weren't drinking.  It's like only like four grams of protein powder.  But if you have to get drinking out of an African river.  Yeah, if you have to put that much protein in your water, is it worth it? 
[01:42:00]  Why don't you just get like a protein shake or something?  Every morning when I get up?  I mean, you know.  That's a lot of protein.  30 grams?  Yeah, man.  No, once you shake it up, it's like a...  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  It's like a shake.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  You know who's my favorite person now?  Dr. Steve.  Oh.  Oh, why?  Because he always helps me.  Yeah, he's like he knows everything.  He really does, that guy.  The guy is so...  He doesn't know it all. 
[01:42:30]  But I don't know if it was said official yesterday, but every time you call Dr. Steve  with a problem, does anyone else find it weird that he has the exact same problem every  time?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I got that too.  Oh.  Everything you call him about, he also has.  That's some single white female shit right there.  Yeah, I understand.  I've dealt with that many times.  Oh, yeah.  The other day, Bonnie and I...  Torn and wrecked them. 
[01:43:00]  The other day, Bonnie and I...  Fucking in the ass.  Yeah.  Did, you know, we applied or we got life insurance for each other.  Oh, boy.  And you've just seen us that night both laying in bed just staring up and daydreaming.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  That's a good joke.  Just tell that one on stage.  Really?  Yeah.  It's kind of funny.  Write it down before you forget.  No.  I'm not that kind of comic man.  And of course, you guys got the great podcast.  I'm definitely a fan of Rich and Voss or Rich and Bonnie or Bonnie and Voss. 
[01:43:30]  He's spitting on his hands.  Whatever the fuck it's called.  My wife hates me.  Oh, yeah.  My wife hates me.  That's what it's called.  I do like it a lot.  How much insurance do you take out on each other?  $2.50.  That's it?  Yeah.  Fucking...  That's not $300.  Come on.  That's a month, man.  Stop with the Nicorette.  This is regular gum.  $200.  That's not?  Yeah.  Chicklets.  Chicklets.  Chicklets.  Chicklets.  I always feel like I'm at the zoo when Rich is here. 
[01:44:00]  Can you just watch?  Yeah.  I just like watching them.  Look at the dodo bird.  Right.  Why bother with $250,000?  That is not going to do anything.  Exactly.  Like, what the fuck difference is $250,000 going to make?  It gives you a little head start.  Not really.  A nice head start for most people.  Not really.  It's way more than $250,000 right now.  You forgot where you came from, man.  No.  $250,000 is a lot.  I'm talking...  Yeah, but not for insurance-like purposes.  What do you mean?  If you let $250,000...  Go ahead.  If you're going to drop dead, I'm sure Bonnie would like a half a mil better or fucking a 
[01:44:30]  million.  Yeah, but you got to pay more for that.  Yeah, you got to look at it.  Like, if you would have dropped dead and you left one of your girls $250,000, it would  pay her way through college, right?  I see where you went there.  You got kids.  You got fucking kids all over the place.  You got fucking three, four wives.  What the fuck?  $250,000. 
[01:45:00]  You act like it's February in here.  What?  It was a Black History Month reference.  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of, see that great fucking tasering video?  Oh, in the corner of here?  No, in Atlanta.  Oh, no.  It is by far one of the greatest of what I call urban videos out there.  And you love urban videos.  I love a good urban video.  It's a security guard in Atlanta, and he apparently has a camera on him, like a GoPro camera. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  Because I guess they have to record everything just in case the hijinks and shenanigans  break out.  And they did.  This woman, she's got four fucking little rats running around her, and one of her friends.  And she starts mouthing off to the security guard, because security guard told her kid to  be quiet because he was yelling or something in the store.  In the store.  Yeah.  And then this fucking hood rat goes after this guy.  Won't shut the fuck up.  Won't shut up.  And then all hell breaks it. 
[01:46:00]  Dude, this is worth listening to this woman.  Turn this up.  Don't yell at my kids.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Get off me.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Don't.  Nigga, don't play with me.  I ain't playin' with you.  Back it up.  Don't play with me.  Back it up.  Fuck, nigga.  Back it up.  Fuck you, turn out, bitch, nigga.  I want to say it like that. 
[01:46:30]  You better back it up!  And the kids jump in.  You better back it up!  She can yell! She can yell!  She can yell! She can yell!  She can yell! She can yell!  Why did they do that?  Pause that!  What is she saying?  She can yell. She can yell.  I thought she was saying chicken ass. 
[01:47:00]  I thought chicken ass, too!  I thought it was a rap video.  You better back it up!  You better back it up!  Apparently, the kid was yelling, and the security guard was like,  God, enough. We should shut up, kid, or something.  He wasn't even that nasty.  And this woman now,  now she cares about her kids, right?  She cares about her kids so much,  she's yelling, fuck you, and nigger in front of them,  and everything, and  will soon fight with the guy,  with the fucking kids right there.  And the kids, if you notice,  you might not know what they're saying, 
[01:47:30]  but they start yelling at the security guard,  going, you gay!  That's why you gay!  You gay!  It's fucking unbelievable!  I just find humor in it, though.  It's hilarious!  And she did worse than the n-word,  the new shit.  It's calling him a fuck nigga.  Oh, really?  Is that what she called him?  Is that a big one?  It's like the child,  the two worst words you can think of.  I like the way she says it, though.  Nickel!  Nickel!  Nickel!  Where is this in the south?  Atlanta.  It was the Hamptons.  Oh, yeah, yeah, the Hamptons.  Oh, really?  Atlanta, or, you know,  I won't say it, but, boy, 
[01:48:00]  there's a certain website out there  that has a different name  for every city in the country.  Is it ATL?  Atlanta's got a good one.  Yeah.  Why don't you do your top five  favorites from that website?  Do you know?  Let's see.  There's...  I mean, it's from a website.  Well, they call it ApeLanta.  Oh, what's it?  And then they call...  No, Chimpcago.  Oh, fuck, I can't remember.  Detroit.  Oh.  No, it's not Black Atlanta. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Just Detroit?  Detroit is something else, yeah.  Oh, I wish I would have fucking...  Now I'm getting a mental block.  No, you don't want to say those names  at the wrong time.  Well, that's true.  Like, you'll actually only slip and say  when you're actually asking  for real information.  Yeah, maybe that one.  Back to the video.  Philadelphia just killed Adelphia.  We know that.  Yeah, when we last left you,  she's yelling at the security guard  who reprimanded the little kids  for screaming in the store he's guarding.  Exactly!  Pussy, nigga!  Come on, he's getting out!  He's getting off on me! 
[01:49:00]  He's getting off on me!  He's getting off on me!  He's getting off on me!  He's getting off on me!  Nigga!  Fuck you!  You better back it up!  Fuck you somebody,  you crazy every night, bitch!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  You better back it up!  You better back it up.  You better back it up.  What's up?  What's up?  Are you gay? 
[01:49:30]  Is he filming or is it on him?  It's on him.  That's a GoPro.  Smallest likely.  Good quality.  You gay.  That's why you gay.  Oh, that's fine.  I got you.  I got you.  Look at this lovely mall.  The cardboard wall.  But I'll say that is good quality.  Yeah.  Fucking A. 
[01:50:00]  This shithole.  Why did he go back out?  Pause.  It seemed like it was kind of over and he went back into the mall area.  He's standing by the door because he's the guard.  No, he started walking away and then he turned back around.  I'm just wondering why he turned back around.  Is that where he's supposed to be outside?  That's his post.  Oh, so he's guarding the door.  So maybe he walked away just to take a breather?  Yeah, take a little breather.  He probably should have just let them walk away though.  That was bad judgment.  Oh, no.  I'm so glad he didn't.  This is hilarious.  I got you. 
[01:50:30]  I got you.  Stay out.  I'm the punk nigga.  I'm the bitch nigga.  Stay out.  I got you.  Stay out.  And he goes back in again.  Is he a white guy or a black guy?  Black guy.  He's his hands.  Oh, he was white.  Stay out.  There's no problem.  I can use my phone to call me.  I ain't going to call nobody.  I'm going to tell you to stay out.  Just stay out.  I bet I walked back to six.  Okay. 
[01:51:00]  Try your luck, honey.  Stay out.  I bet I walked back to six.  Stay out.  You got a line?  Okay.  Walks back in again.  Okay.  He's ready.  Get out, dog.  Oh, yeah.  You gay.  Get your kids.  They like terrible kids.  Get your children.  Get your children.  Oh, boy.  Get your children.  Get your children.  Chime if you want.  You better get out there.  Back.  You better back it up.  You better back it up.  Back it up. 
[01:51:30]  Pushing her out of the store.  She takes a swing.  Another swing.  Watch this.  This is great.  This is great.  There you go.  Good mother.  Wow.  She fucking goes down like...  Someone described it great.  She fell like a Barbie doll.  If you just stand a Barbie doll up and let go of it, that's exactly how she fell over. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, it knocks you out like that.  Ah, yes.  Electricity will knock you out like that.  Holy fuck.  Instant compliance.  Wow.  Electricity really shuts a big mouth.  Electricity's a motherfucker.  She fucking hit the ground.  Oh, I hated her.  Can we please see again?  Sure.  That was wonderful.  She bounces off the door a little.  She hits the door.  Just falls over.  But they give this guy, because at mall, he has his own camera and a fucking taser.  Because they've had probably so many problems. 
[01:52:30]  Absolutely.  She walked back in and was physical with him.  She was swinging at the guy.  Also, notice, though, this fucking hood rat is amazing, because she goes down like that.  Notice after she sits herself back up, she pulls the barbs right out of herself.  Any crazy-ass white person would just be sitting there going,  Ow!  Ow!  Why did you do that?  She pulls the barbs right out of herself.  Well, what about the bus incident, where that lady took the uppercuts and laid the fuck back up? 
[01:53:00]  A punch none of us would be able to take.  No.  Oh, did she go down?  Show that again.  It's so good.  It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  You better back it up!  You better back it up!  Back it up!  He's pushing her away, and she swings at him.  You better back it up!  Right in front of the kids.  Yeah, she's swinging at him.  This country. 
[01:53:30]  You better back it up!  You better back it up!  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  How are those shitty kids?  Beast comes walking out.  What you doing, Man Mum?  What you doing, Man Mum?  What are my babies right there?  What are you doing?  My baby's right there, you tripping.  For real?  My babies right down!  For real?  All my babies right down!  Off football?  That must be one of the fathers.  Back it up! 
[01:54:00]  I'll hit you! I'll hit you! I'll hit you!  The guy's talking to you when he walks away.  I'll hit you! I'll hit you!  I'll hit you! I'll hit you!  If I'm going to get you, boy, at six, my children ain't here.  There will absolutely be a shooting there. 
[01:54:30]  Of course. Of course.  Right now, we're just watching.  I guess the father of one of the fucking little problems, he comes in all fucking pissed off.  Let me ask you, was that the father of one of those kids?  Because he didn't interfere when the guy was yelling at the check.  Why is he going to interfere with the fucking bitch?  I don't know.  He doesn't want no shit. He's probably laughing while his fucking bitch is going at the security guard. 
[01:55:00]  For my babies? For my babies? You do that for my babies?  But what are you expected to do?  My baby? No!  Exactly.  Whose babies?  His baby.  But his babies seem as her babies?  I would assume at least one of them.  Yeah.  You know.  The community's babies.  Maybe.  He was in the jewelry store getting dental work, and then he came out and saw it happen.  The jewelry store.  That's pretty good, Rich.  Yeah, that was my favorite clip from yesterday. 
[01:55:30]  That one popped up online.  That one's everywhere.  Man.  That clip's everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good one.  It had all the features, is what it had.  It had the mouthy bitch.  It had the tasering.  It had the little fucking crazy-ass doomed children.  You gay!  That's right!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  You gay!  How ironic that Sal just walked in.  Sorry, Sal.  We've got to be nice to Sal.  I like Sal.  Do we?  Well, we spent two days talking about how our upbringings brought some mental and physical 
[01:56:00]  abuse.  Oh.  I heard through Mars that Sal had some issues when he was growing up as well.  What?  You shared a story with Mars, I hear?  What is this?  What story was this?  Well, maybe Mars could come in.  You shared a story.  How about your grandma?  What did I miss?  My grandma?  What did I miss?  Here comes Mars.  Here comes Mars.  I told him that this morning.  I'm sorry.  It was a few days ago.  Now, Ian, you missed the last couple of days in Mars.  Yes, yes. 
[01:56:30]  Mars took a hot spatula to his hands at nine years old.  Oh, man.  Hot, oily spatula.  What happened there?  And then his mom, when Mars was 12, decided they were going to fight, fist fight.  And then there was a time that Mars got his head stuck under an old-school stereo and  his mom beat the shit out of him.  Oh.  Yeah, some great stories from Mars the last couple of days.  He was under the fucking thing, and his mother was just yelling, you gay!  You gay!  That's why you gay!  That's why you gay!  That's why you gay!  And we also learned Mars' mom didn't like using bathrooms, so she had like a piss thing. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Almost like a bedpan-y thing.  And instead of getting up and going 20 feet, she would pee like, you know, on the side of  the bed.  That's fucking disgusting.  Bennington raised a good point, though.  Ryan raised a good point.  They might have raised an area with like, you know, not a good bathroom situation.  I was thinking maybe the father would rape her in the middle of the night, but that might  not be it.  Oh, well, maybe.  I assume that's for everything.  And Mars, what happened?  And then Sal decided, man, you know what?  I can relate to the shit that went down with you.  Yeah, Sal shared a story with me this morning about the piss pot. 
[01:57:30]  And he's got something in reference to his grandmother, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I mean, she didn't do it to me.  That's why you were saying abuse to me.  It didn't happen.  It was just that what would be my great-great-great-grandmother, like my grandmother's grandmother.  It's like slave time.  Yeah.  Back in the old country, she would like piss in...  Don't call her that.  Yeah, she would piss in like a chamber pot of some sort.  And when my grandmother was behaving badly, she would like flick piss at her and shit like  that.  Norton pays for that.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  Wait, your grandmother would get pissed flicked at her by your great-grandmother?  By her grandmother, yeah.  Like, it was fucking weird back then.  She pissed in a pot.  Yeah.  At least she had one.  Yeah, or she would dip her fucking hand in there and flick it at her.  Yeah, she would like dip her hand in it and then like flick it at him, you know, like  kind of like, you know.  Oh, God damn.  This is gross.  How does that relate to you?  Oh, 1800s.  Was that 1800s?  No, that would be, um...  How could you have a great-great...  Mid-40s, I guess.  What? 
[01:58:30]  1940s.  What?  Your grandmother's...  My grandmother's grandmother.  Your grandmother's grandmother wasn't around in 1940.  Wait.  I know you're younger than us.  That's impossible.  Hold on.  My grandmother was born roughly, I think, 43, 44, so I'm assuming it would be late 40s.  So her grandmother might have been old then, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Her grandmother was probably old.  Wait.  My grandma, you said, was born when?  His...  The cunt...  His cunt grandmother.  Is that...  And the pig cunt...  But there's still two generations there. 
[01:59:00]  So wait, 1940, your grandmother was born?  Correct.  This was the lady who was getting the piss flick out.  Right, right.  I can see it.  And this was her grandmother.  Yeah, so I mean, she was born in the late 1800s.  Right.  That lady was probably born like...  Maybe, yeah, but she was alive in the 40s.  Right, right.  Yeah, that lady would probably be, I'd say, late 1800s.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  So that bitch was flicking piss in the 40s.  Yeah, flicking piss.  When your grandmother was in her, like, five or six or eight years old.  Why don't you have a little piss, sweetie?  Yeah.  I'll teach you to misbehave.  Why don't you take some of this?  A little flick-a-roo.  Yeah, so when Mars told me that story...  One time I flicked a Negro for touching a lemon candy. 
[01:59:30]  A lemon candy.  It's a hard thing to be touching.  Wow, that's kind of fucked up.  So Sam's way of relating to Mars' abuse.  Yeah.  Talk about the abuse that his grandmother suffered.  It wasn't from her grandmother.  Oh, jeez.  Well, you know what?  That's not relating.  I think as far as suffering in the 40s go, I think there's a few other people that might  have suffered a bit more than have a little piss flicked out of you.  That's right. 
[02:00:00]  Red Sox fans.  Exactly.  Shut up, Joe.  Mars, was he trying to relate to you, you think?  No, he just said that it reminded him of that piss pot thing and brought back some flashbacks  of that story.  Did you let him know that it wasn't at all relatable?  Getting the shit kicked out of you by your mom because your head was stuck under an old  stereo?  Your mom coming home, you coming home and your mom saying, put your dukes up is not  the same.  We're going to fight today?  Yes.  Did you tell him that because of your traumatic childhood, you bought boots that look like 
[02:00:30]  Smucker's jars?  Is that what you're saying?  Lift up your boot.  I've got to see now.  His stupid Smucker's boots.  They're Timberloons.  They're Timberloons.  Oh, some Payless shits.  Those aren't Timberloons.  Ditto-ass boots.  Oh, man.  They're Caterpillars.  My bad.  Caterpillars.  That's some Payless bullshit.  Exactly.  Caterpillars.  Then put them on a grocery store.  Wait.  Fuck.  They're good for stomping Sal's. 
[02:01:00]  Let's see.  Yeah, I got it.  Oh.  Oof.  He says he's not gay.  What?  For the record, Sal says he's not gay.  You said that?  Yes, I am not.  That's weird.  God damn.  Yeah.  Say that.  Everyone looks away.  I don't mind if Sal's gay.  I don't care.  We don't care.  I don't care if Sal's gay.  No, I know.  We don't mind if he's gay.  We just get weirded out when he says he's gay.  I don't care if he grabs a penis and balls like a fife.  Yeah.  Those kids in Atlanta might mind, but we don't.  You gay.  Yeah.  You can't make a...  You can't cum with a girl.  Can we do...  That's why you gay. 
[02:01:30]  That's why you gay.  Can we do gay experiments with you to make sure you're not?  Yeah, I think we're doing that for the...  He is flopping the gay-off entertainer.  Is Fezzy still all mad at our gay-off or something?  He's kind of wrapped up in marital bliss right now.  Yeah, I don't know what the hell's going on there.  I haven't been listening.  I've read some tweets, but I don't know what the fuck is going on.  Ronnie explained it perfectly yesterday.  Five years ago, he kind of threw it out there.  Like, if those two are still single five years from now, they should get married or whatever.  And they both agreed at the time.  And someone kept track of this. 
[02:02:00]  Wow.  And the five-year date came...  Holy shit.  Came through a couple days ago, and Ronnie brought it back up.  And they're like, all right, we're in.  And they're actually getting married.  Because Ronnie doesn't do fake shit like that.  No, he doesn't.  So they're actually going to get married.  Is my sister doing the honors?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And we're giving away Stalker Patty.  I agreed to that yesterday.  I hope he's walking her down the aisle.  Oh, wow.  Who's going to get married?  Fez and Stalker Patty.  No.  Are they going to consummate the marriage?  That's what I asked.  Because that's the biggest thing.  Fez is gay, and Patty's a virgin. 
[02:02:30]  So is Fez, though.  No, but Fez is an asexual gay.  No, what did he say?  A-sexual.  No, Ronnie thinks he's asexual as well.  A gay-sexual.  Gay-asexual.  Gay-asexual, possibly.  Because he's never done anything.  You gay-asexual.  That's right.  You gay-asexual.  He's not done anything with a woman or a man.  Right.  He doesn't even really jerk off.  What?  Exactly!  It's crazy.  And then, of course, Stalker Patty's still a virgin, so.  And she's so fucked.  You've got two asexuals getting married. 
[02:03:00]  She's so fucked up in the head that she won't have sex with anybody unless she knows them.  And, well, she knows Fez.  She's going to be married to him.  And if they're married...  They have to have the sex, right?  She's going to be Patty Wiley.  But then that would be the easy annulment.  But Ronnie's like, no, they're really going to get married, and then they can figure out  how to get out of it.  Yeah.  That's how great...  That's why this is great.  Because then they're going to have to deal with the annulment and everything else that  goes with it.  But they're having a full wedding at the Hard Rock.  Could you see if Patty just all of a sudden turns into a complete cunt? 
[02:03:30]  She's like, I want half of what you own, and I'm going after future earning potential.  I know.  You know we're all hoping for that.  Oh, God.  There's got to be a spin on this one.  I want to live the lifestyle I've grown accustomed to.  That's right.  She wants a box.  Yeah, exactly.  Coffee grinds and clean her vagina with.  That's how she cleans her pussy.  She puts a bunch of full coffee beans on them, and she grinds it up with her fucking hand. 
[02:04:00]  So.  Oh, man.  So that's developing.  Yeah, so he hasn't been so concerned with the gay off as of late, because he's thinking  about the fact that he's marrying Slotka Patty.  Right.  Wow.  Somebody actually kept tabs on that.  Yep.  It's amazing.  Yep.  What are these broads?  I don't know.  They might be the lingerie.  So the NFL's really doing a great job, you know, marketing to the female fan and knowing  there was a void in the market, and now they're coming out with great, you know, form-fitting  jerseys now, which Nike's doing, and like I said, we were dressed head to knee and didn't 
[02:04:30]  know what shoes we were going to wear.  And so we went to the NFL, banged down their door.  This news woman.  First you'd be dazzled us with your sweatshirt.  That fucking head is just standing there looking going, what is this bitch saying?  Wow.  She's babbling.  They don't look too bad.  They should dyke out on Fox News.  They should lez off.  Fuck yeah.  Dyke out.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Man.  Do a little of that cooter.  All right.  No, they've been talking about that fucking, what's her name, that model? 
[02:05:00]  Kate Upton.  Kate Upton.  Kate Upton.  Kate Upton.  Are you a fan of Kate Upton?  No.  There's hotter girls, right?  I think she's, you know, they're making...  She gets a lot of attention when there's hotter girls out there.  They're making all the attention, hers, about the Super Bowl commercial, because I guess  she's washing a car or some shit.  Yeah, we watched it the other day.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's supposed to be all hot?  Hands fucking down, that model chick that's doing that Carl's Jr. commercial.  What about...  She did the Ari bra commercial over the Christmas shit. 
[02:05:30]  She is so fucking smoking hot, this girl.  Now, hold on.  It's crazy.  Before you show me, I'm going to throw another girl into the mix.  All right.  The girl that does, what is it, the Dish commercials?  Oh, yeah, but she's like 12.  What?  The one that, I know you're talking about, where she sits on, she appears like that.  The one with the eyes?  Yeah.  Is it for Dish?  I forgot the company, I don't even know, because I'm too busy looking at her.  What are you talking about?  She's fucking smoking.  Let's see.  You know who I'm talking about, right?  Yeah.  But she's really young?  Look at her. 
[02:06:00]  She's got to be like 18, 17.  I mean, young for three of us.  So now we got two to look at.  Go to the still pictures.  No, I thought we were going to the commercial.  Oh, really?  No, I don't think it's out yet.  Look at this fucking chick.  Let me see.  She is smoking.  She's way hotter than Kate Upton.  Is smoking.  Can you make that a very large section?  She was in the Ari bra commercials over.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Dude, she's fucking.  She's way hotter than Kate Upton.  She's the most incredible model out there right now. 
[02:06:30]  Let me see her.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  She blows Kate Upton away.  Smoking.  What's her name?  Yeah.  Smoking.  No, look at another picture if you're going eh.  I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.  She's phenomenal.  She's got that Victoria's Secret look.  She does, yeah, yeah.  Was she one of those?  She looks like a young Ann Margaret.  She's doing the Sports Illustrated.  She fucks up everything.  She's doing Sports Illustrated swimsuit.  Did you hear what he said?  Ann Margaret.  She looks like a young Ann Margaret.  Yes.  Thank God.  No one remembers her as young anymore.  You really say unsightly. 
[02:07:00]  Look at how pretty she is.  That was horrible.  She is really pretty.  She looks like the back of Kennedy's limo seat.  Ann Margaret.  She was a looker maybe 50 years ago.  Look at.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Fucking grab that up.  Look at that fucking.  She's smoking.  Which girl are you talking about?  Get Opie's chick up.  The commercial one.  The turtle bites a guy's finger.  He goes, what's worse than this?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  I think I might lose. 
[02:07:30]  She's.  I think I might lose.  I don't.  Let's find mine.  Mine's in the commercial.  I don't even know what fucking company it's for.  Someone help me out.  All right.  Somebody on Paletalks.  Speak up.  Dish Network.  Come on.  Don't be assholes.  Is it just Dish?  You know what I'm talking about.  Help out here.  For me or you?  You.  All right.  Yeah.  Because you're going to win, though.  You're smoking.  Look at that.  I'm already giving up on this.  But still.  I mean.  No.  That's just pictures of dishes.  Hold on.  Just get the commercial.  I'm sure it's online.  Which commercial?  I think it's for Dish. 
[02:08:00]  There's a lot of Dish.  Oh, you guys are stupid.  Go to videos and I'll fucking find it.  The Hopper.  Is it for the Hopper?  The Harry Brawl girl is not the Victoria girl, fish man, you fucking asshole.  What the fuck?  She's not even hot, that one.  It's Agdell.  Nina Agdell is the hot girl.  All right.  But can't they help me out as well?  So we can compare this?  Yeah.  It's the Dish commercial.  Now find the Dish commercial girl.  It's the brand new Dish commercial.  I think it's for Dish.  Is it Dish? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Do you have anything more?  No.  Anna Davis is the girl you are talking about.  All right.  Let's see if it is.  Hold on.  Chris, is it the one I'm talking about or Anthony?  Yeah.  The one you're talking about, Hopper.  The girl at the end of the Dish commercial.  Her name is Anna Davis and it's Jeter's new girlfriend.  It's Jeter's new girlfriend?  That doesn't look like her.  No.  There's a bunch of pigs on that page.  Yeah.  There's a lot of horrible Anna Davis.  It's like Ann B. Davis is showing up.  That's horrible.  I don't know if that's the one I'm thinking of.  I'm telling you, it's the end of David. 
[02:09:00]  Probably not.  I'm still looking here.  No one can help.  Come on, sir.  The commercial's on every other fucking...  Someone says it's DirecTV.  Oh, DirecTV.  Okay.  Yeah, stop looking up Dish.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to DirecTV.  Thank you.  Now we're on to some...  All right.  But I'm going to lose already.  Let's see.  Well, that girl you're talking about is cute, man.  Let's see.  Those big eyes.  Okay.  DirecTV.  This girl.  You've seen this commercial a million times.  I know, but I've seen a lot of commercials.  All right. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  This girl.  All right.  Well, wait a minute.  Let's see.  Oh, well.  What do we got here?  Why can't I see the picture very well?  Is there better Google Images?  I'm losing in the Google Image war that we're having.  Janetta Arnett.  Is that her name?  If that's not her name, you're getting bounced, Jayster.  Jayster?  Is that his real name?  Is that your name for me?  Oh, you're having fun today.  I want people to call me that from now on.  I'm not taking any shit when people fucking are supposed to...  All right.  I'm sick of this thing popping. 
[02:10:00]  Full screen, goddammit.  Why are you getting so mad?  I shouldn't have to stop watching this show.  Get ready to pause, because she's not on for a long.  Okay, bite his finger.  Oh, she'll suck.  All right.  Oh, I know her.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Pause at the worst time.  Yeah.  Since you record five shows.  Oh, yeah.  She looks a little exotic, though.  What's wrong with that?  I'm not into exotic.  Do you know who that chick is?  That's that.  She's fucking.  She's beautiful.  It's Becky Terdesky. 
[02:10:30]  You fucked it up.  Becky Terdesky.  Yeah.  Her name's Hannah Davis.  All right.  Let's now look at some Hannah Davis.  Hannah Davis, that guy in the room.  I think asshole was trying to make a joke.  All right.  Which picture you want to see?  You got a lot of nice ones here.  I'd go third one in with the umbrella to start.  All right.  Go there.  Go there.  Let's start there.  Let's see.  Let's get a winner today.  You know what?  There's something a little less skanky Fiona Apple about her face.  Come on.  But.  Come on.  You know what?  I think I even have to give it to you. 
[02:11:00]  No.  The other girl's hotter, but she's pretty cute.  I'll give it to her.  She's pretty cute.  It's a little like Robin White.  I'm going with the Nina girl.  Robin.  Yeah.  It's just not going to happen.  Nina's fucking hot.  I still fuck Pinta and Santa Maria.  I know.  It's stuck.  Robin Whitey now says.  Yeah.  With the umbrella.  She used to be really hot.  I actually had a thing for Robin White.  Yeah.  When she was on Santa Barbara.  She was.  What do you think, Ant? 
[02:11:30]  She's fucking hot.  Rich is like, she's no Miss Crabtree.  I think you win, though.  I don't know.  I'm going to give the win to Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think.  I'm tapping out of this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it wins.  Show.  Got that picture that's behind all that shit.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  I fucking love.  She's the best fucking girl in the world.  She is amazing.  She was in an Ari Braw commercial for Christmas.  Play that fucking thing.  Really?  Yeah.  Play that fucking thing, Sam.  Come on. 
[02:12:00]  God damn it.  I'm glad you're all in on the Kate Upton thing.  Yeah.  Fuck her.  The whole world is all about Kate Upton.  She's hot, but she's not hot like the one in the show.  The one that's in the Mercedes commercial.  The video.  The video.  She's a little chunky, that one.  She's pretty.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Ari Braw.  All right.  She's like, but her face isn't as good as the other fucking girl.  Look at this shit.  This is the photo shoot for her?  That's her?  She looks different there.  That's not a good.  This isn't the commercial. 
[02:12:30]  This is the making of the commercial, I guess.  Look at how fucking smoking this chick is.  Is that Kate Upton?  No.  No.  That girl's pretty.  She's cute.  That's the Nina girl.  Oh, man.  Take the camera back, you fucking pussies.  All right.  Go that one down.  Yes.  Yes.  That's the one.  This is the actual commercial?  Yes.  I will.  I don't know if I'm going to show you.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Pretty inside and out.  Holy shit.  Look at her.  She's a lovely girl.  For the girl next door.  Yeah, you're the girl next door.  She's really pretty.  Look at this.  She's just in her bra and panties, frolicking. 
[02:13:00]  Look at her frolic.  She's just relaxing.  She's the girl next door, right, Rich?  Oh, my God.  Is that fucking crazy?  I used to jack off in 30 seconds to that commercial.  The girl next door to us.  Christmas time.  I was missing a tooth.  Yeah.  The girl next door.  Don't tell me about the girl next door.  Where'd that come from?  The girl next door.  There's not a person alive that had a really good girl next door.  Yeah.  Don't remind me of any neighborhood I ever lived in, but maybe that's just me. 
[02:13:30]  What the hell do I know?  Hey, regular Joe.  Rich Voss is going to be at the Stress Factory Thursday through Saturday.  Stressfactory.com.  And then he's doing a film festival thing, but he doesn't really know where it is.  February 9th, Athena Film Festival at College in New York.  Athena.  Barnard.  We at least figured it out.  Now you can say it.  Barnard College.  It's the women's college up near Columbia.  Yeah.  I don't know exactly where it is.  It's going to be great.  James P. Norton.  Two gigs for this month to plug.  One is Atlantic City.  The first show is sold out with myself, Artie, Amy, and Dave Attell. 
[02:14:00]  It's February 17th.  The Late Show is available in Borgata.  And Dave Attell and myself are doing a co-headline show Friday and Saturday.  The February 22nd and 23rd will be in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Hollywood Theater.  And today on my show, I'm doing my show.  Oh, that's right.  It's Wednesday.  It's the Jim Norton show.  I never had a guest before, but I'm having a guest today.  She's a lovely girl.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  You don't want to tell us who?  Oh, yeah.  In the studio?  In the studio.  I didn't know that.  I thought it was maybe going to be a quick phone or something.  It's the lovely Bailey Jay will be my co-host today.  Yes.  Has she been on this show or no?  No.  Okay.  Someday we get her on this show.  Wait.  Is it the 17th of Sunday?  Yeah.  On Monday?  Yeah, it's Sunday night.  We were off Monday because of the holiday.  Is it at the Borgata?  Yes.  Oh, we got a free night there and dinner.  Maybe we'll hang out.  Oh, you guys should.  You guys should.  I would love to see you there.  We went last year.  Yeah.  We had a good time, remember?  That was fun.  We had dinner. 
[02:15:00]  That was a good time.  Why do you get free dinner in the night just from when Bonnie did that roast?  Didn't you get all those gifts, all those certificates when you did that roast for the...  Bordain?  Yeah.  I don't think I got anything, no.  Oh.  I'll ask one of that.  Yeah.  Because those are like a couple dinners and Borgata.  I didn't get any of that stuff.  You probably left before they gave it to you or, you know, I'm sure they had it for you.  Well, I never got it.  Well, I didn't want to bum you out, but you asked.  No, I'm not bummed out. 
[02:15:30]  I'm just, you know.  I'm sure you got it.  I didn't.  I would tell you.  I would look at that.  He didn't get it.  I'm sorry, but maybe we'll go watch him.  It's pretty fucking hot right now.  Did you put that video up?  Kate Fetton.  She's the greatest.  Did you put the video up about in the welfare office?  With a woman yelling at the fucking woman behind the counter? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  I've retweeted it, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's hilarious.  It's another one.  And the other one was at, like, a fucking cable TV place where they were supposed to  be there to pay the bill, and the woman's just losing her mind.  And the guy's like, yeah, motherfucker!  Oh, it was fucking...  And poor white people, they're just standing in line like, I'm not seeing anything.  I'm not doing anything.  White people are petrified when black people start yelling.  And they should be, because when that guy at the pizza place, you ever see that one?  Where he fucking started mouthing off to the girl that was going at it. 
[02:16:30]  There was a chick, right?  Yeah.  Here's what happened.  That guy was on the phone with his girlfriend.  Yeah.  And he was in a pizza line.  This fucking cunty, like, chick came in and cut him.  Black girl.  She cut him, but then he was saying stuff about her into his phone.  Yeah.  But he was trying to be like a ghetto white guy, like, I don't know what she's doing,  like, stuff like that.  And then they were arguing nasty, and her boyfriend came in.  She went out and got a massive boyfriend.  That guy was a fucking ox.  And this guy, I'm surprised in front of the boyfriend, this guy was still yelling at this 
[02:17:00]  girl, like, pointing in her face.  Check yourself!  Or whatever it was he was saying.  And then the boyfriend slugged him.  Punched him so hard in the face.  He went down, and then the guy steals his cell phone and his wallet.  Shit.  Jesus.  And walked out the door.  That guy got four years in jail for that.  Yeah?  Yeah, and she got in trouble, too.  That was brutal.  Yeah.  When we get back, I want to talk about the artificial arm guy.  It's the story of the fucking day.  We haven't even mentioned it yet.  Looks like Matthew Modine.  It's crazy.  It's unbelievable.  We'll explain next. 
[02:17:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Serious.  Next time.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we're hanging with Rich Voss, our pal here.  He's going to be at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Thursday through  Saturday.  Vinny's Club.  Yep.  Haven't been down there in a while.  Always a good club. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe I'll go and see Rich Voss this weekend.  Oh!  Oh, you guys can come over for dinner early if you like.  I don't want to do that.  Yeah.  Do you do much entertaining?  Never.  Yeah.  We kind of hang out as a couple.  Sometimes.  No, we don't.  Yeah, the Vosses are the only couple friends we got.  Really?  Where we do it as like a couple thing.  And the only, and really what holds it together is the girls.  Barney and Lindsay.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Because when we go out, we have nothing to say.  Because we just.  What's up?  Are we going to say, hey, this year I want to play golf again? 
[02:18:30]  I know.  This is the year, though.  We're going to take lessons in everything.  We're going to get back out there.  Come back to the Lynx.  I'm going to try.  I really am.  I'm going to take some lessons in shit.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I had to throw away that toy gun you gave my son.  It was too creepy.  My wife.  What a dummy.  You even think, right?  Of course.  All right.  I feel bad, though.  She bought her.  It was just.  How old is your kid?  Like three, two?  He's getting closer to three. 
[02:19:00]  For Chris, my wife buys him a gun.  And it says five plus on it, and he didn't even understand it.  They get thrown out of school for that now.  This thing was.  This was basically an assault weapon.  It really was.  An assault toy?  Yeah.  Definitely an assault toy gun.  I don't care if he plays with guns.  Yeah.  It was just the whole thing.  He just couldn't figure it out.  My theory on assault.  A little odd.  I throw toys away in the middle of the night.  Is that a disorder? 
[02:19:30]  You're like a bizarro Santa.  No.  Actually, middle of the night, which means when I wake up in the morning, I do a quick little  scan of my apartment, and I'm just a little bit here and there.  Oh, man.  Keeps it in check.  I learned this from my brother.  My brother gave me this tip.  Oh, man.  Because your house gets completely taken over by the kid and his stuff.  And you just look around.  You're like, oh, oh, there's a puzzle that is already missing pieces.  All right.  I'm going to fucking throw the rest of this away.  It's garbage.  And yeah.  If you do it in front of the kids, then they freak out, right? 
[02:20:00]  A couple stuffed animals.  When I throw out toys in the middle of the night, it's because I couldn't get poop off  of them.  Get it?  Novelty toys.  Get it?  Of course.  Our closet is full of junk.  My kid's closet, like all the crap.  And she has hundreds.  She'll get a stuffed animal and done with it that day.  But that's her best friend.  It's just crap all over the place.  A kid will love a toy for probably 48 hours, and then they're on to the next one. 
[02:20:30]  It's horrible.  So yeah, sneak around and just fucking throw some shit away here and there.  Well, you know, the present, Lindsay got our daughter for Christmas.  It's a gift.  It comes every month.  It's a toy that you put together in a little box.  So they're like...  Is it bad?  No, it's cool.  Oh, okay.  It's cool.  And...  Oh, what happened?  No, nothing.  Is it bad?  No, you get 12 different...  Is this I have to get you back now?  No, no.  I'm saying...  Because my wife gave you...  Lindsay knows how to send a present.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, okay. 
[02:21:00]  You know, she put thought into, oh, is there something a kid can get every month and put  it together herself with her family?  Because that's what I want to do is just sit around and put toys together, you know.  But they're good toys.  They're like arts and crafts and stuff like...  Oh, educational toys.  Yeah, those are the ones I always liked the most growing up.  The educational toy.  You know what?  What?  I mean, I didn't know this because people told me this, but it is true.  You relive your childhood?  I got the fucking Magic Garden.  I was all in.  What? 
[02:21:30]  Do you remember the Magic Garden?  No.  That liquidy shit?  And you...  Oh, did it grow those fucking rocks?  Those crystal-y things?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do remember that.  I forgot all about that.  My son got one for...  A couple of them for Christmas.  One was a snowman.  Yeah.  Where he's holding his fucking broom.  And you pour that shit in the dish and then it just kind of grows all this crystal-y shit.  What?  And then there was a mountaintop scene.  Oh, really?  I liked it way more than he did.  Yeah, that!  That's the exact one right there, right there! 
[02:22:00]  Oh, man.  It's called Magic Garden.  Mine didn't look that good.  Fuck, what did I do wrong?  Do you remember this shit, though?  Yeah, yeah, I do remember that shit.  It was cool, man.  That's pretty wild.  How fast does it grow?  Really fast.  Within two hours, some shit was happening.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and by the next day, it looks like that.  Damn, yo.  Yeah, I loved it.  How are you reliving it now?  What do you mean?  You said you relive your...  You relive your childhood because this is some of the stuff I remember when I was growing  up.  We had this Magic Garden shit when we were growing up. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  And then the sea monkeys, I think we got that.  Oh, fuck.  I just realized we have that.  I gotta go find that.  Sea people.  Remember sea people?  Sea monkeys gay.  You gay.  You gay.  You gay.  You gay.  What is it, brine shrimp or something?  Yeah, yeah.  That's all it is.  They show them on the box all fucking playing and they're on a trapeze.  Yeah, no shit.  And they're fucking seesaws.  False advertising.  And they're just brine shrimp.  Stupid brine shrimp.  I hate that.  That hatch.  But I'm gonna do that.  I gotta find that.  I just remembered a hatch. 
[02:23:00]  You know how many tons of that Iraq has to eat a day to survive?  It's amazing.  Strains it through his baleen.  Iraq, comment.  Does it need one?  Iraq, were you abused as a child ever?  Or did you have one of those happy homes?  For the most part.  Yeah.  You were abused for the most part?  No, for the most part it was a happy home.  Oh, yeah.  Were you, I mean, was there ever any violence in your pen?  Oh, my God.  Just so unnecessary.  Hey, can we talk about artificial... 
[02:23:30]  Dissemination.  ...arms guy?  Oh.  Yeah.  They're not artificial.  They're, um...  Oh, you know what?  They are not artificial.  Are they real arms?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have a guy who, I think he's the first soldier to survive a, uh, losing all his limbs.  All four limbs in a roadside bombing.  He lost all four.  Both arms, both legs.  And this guy's attitude is beyond amazing.  I don't, I don't understand guys like that.  On the outside.  Carry on.  And, and, and everyone around him has said how amazing his personality is.  Yeah.  And, uh, he, they, they give him fake, uh, artificial legs and arms and he did really well with both 
[02:24:00]  of them.  Even though he, he really despised not having arms.  He said he, he was able to accept not having legs, but he just could not accept not having  the arms.  He was okay with not, no legs.  Yeah.  It does suck.  So they turned around and they gave him two, uh, itches.  You're like, what do I do?  They gave him two, uh, two arms.  Do you think his dick and balls got blown off?  Oh, like, how do you lose your, cause if I'm assuming he was in a truck that went over 
[02:24:30]  an IED.  How do you, how does a blast do that to you without just blowing your dick and balls and  your ass off?  Like, cause how, like, how do your, well, those are the guys that don't make it.  Your four, how do your arms and legs, what position are you in?  Were they all four blown up?  That's what, unless he's picking something up and his, we probably could get a soldier.  on the line.  This is important.  This stuff is important.  Right.  Like that, that's how your arms get blown off.  But what's this guy's name?  He's, he's pretty amazing.  He did a press conference yesterday and he was actually itching his face.  He put his, uh, his, uh, his new arm from another guy up to his face and he was kind 
[02:25:00]  of like itching or scratching or whatever.  That's insane.  Amazing.  They showed the operating room and there was all sorts of, um, um, areas set up.  They had, I forgot how many, like 12 or 13 surgeons.  They all had their specialty.  So he went over here for like the nerve work.  Then they moved them to this part of the operating room for the muscle work and all the other  shit that goes with this.  And they went from station to station with this guy.  Isn't it amazing how he has to, it's something like his brain, like he can think which finger 
[02:25:30]  he wants to raise and his brain stimulates the right muscle on the right finger.  Like that's not his, like how the surgeons attach that is fucking amazing.  It really is amazing.  And, uh, do we know anything else about this guy?  Some odd fucking things.  No kidding.  You know, it's like those, someone else's arms, you jack off, you're fucking another man's  touching your dick.  You got fucking different fingerprints.  So you could fucking rob something.  They get the fingerprints and like, that guy's been dead. 
[02:26:00]  Fuck it.  But they know where the arm went.  They might've made note of it when they put the arms on it.  Oh, maybe.  After he robs them, is he going to wheel away?  How quick?  Well, that's true.  Does he have fake legs too, right?  No.  Yeah.  He's got artificial legs.  Or he's in the wheelchair without them, but.  Yeah.  No, he has artificial legs.  For the press conference, I think he, uh, did it in a wheelchair.  I want to know if he's going to get how much, how much strength in the, in the arms.  Oh, wait.  Are these sewn on arms?  They are.  Yeah.  These, okay.  These are not attachments. 
[02:26:30]  These are like sewn on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're real.  How about his legs?  Are the legs?  No, no, no.  Artificial legs, meaning metal.  Metal.  Okay.  And then his arms are from another guy.  Lieutenant Dan legs.  And then real flesh arms.  Believe me.  I don't.  Strong.  I don't fucking discount the importance of my legs, but I would much rather lose my legs than  my arms because they, they can do that.  They just can't really figure out that hand.  Oh, it's rough.  I've seen so many guys since, uh, since we sent our boys over there with fake legs around  the city and most of them do really well.  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  The arms.  Cause you need, you know, you're grabbing shit, your legs, as long as you can walk on  them.  Right.  What are you doing?  You know, they got that technology down pretty good.  You're only fucking, you know, but your hands, you got to pick shit up with them.  Yeah.  What do we know about this guy that we haven't said yet, Sam?  Anything else?  I mean, he's 26.  Uh, they said he's been nonchalant about the whole thing.  Eh, whatever.  A couple arms.  Sure.  I'll take them.  He woke up in the hospital and he didn't, you know, he didn't know he had lost his arms  and legs, but he woke up in the hospital and, uh, they said he, they told him you lost 
[02:27:30]  your arms and he said he shrugged his shoulders and went back to sleep.  Uh, whatever.  Maybe he knew it in some way when the explosion happened or maybe he was, I don't know.  Why am I speculating?  Who the fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to know how you're in a position to lose arms and legs and, and I mean, not the  dick and balls, but it's like, do you lose that too?  I'm sure.  Or is it the seat?  I'm sure some of these guys, absolutely.  That's what happened.  They lost their legs and their dick and balls.  But are you sitting on a seat that protects that?  Well, he's the first guy to survive losing all your limbs. 
[02:28:00]  That's what they said.  Might have fucking shredded his legs or something, you know?  His arm's so bad that they had to cut him off.  Oh, right, right, right.  I see what you're saying.  The rest of it.  You know, who knows?  That's pretty fucking bad.  What are the doctors saying?  How strong will his arms get?  They're not saying exactly how strong.  He can already twist the wrist in his left arm.  I think it has to take time for nerves to grow and stuff.  He said the nerves grow to...  He had this surgery four to six months ago, I think.  Yeah, he said the nerves only grow an inch every month. 
[02:28:30]  Really?  Yeah, they regenerate, so they're going to have to wait,  and he's going to have to go through therapy  and find out if they connected everything right.  How far...  Now, an inch a month, which is actually more than I would have thought.  That's a lot more than I would have thought.  Sure.  How many inches of nerves do you need to...  Like, all the way from the wrist to the hand,  or is it the entire arm nerve?  I guess it's however much they needed to...  Well, I would assume it's where they connected it.  Yeah.  So how much you need there?  Well, did the arm already have nerves in it that he's using,  or is his own nerves growing all the way down through? 
[02:29:00]  Like, an inch a month, you figure that might be a couple years.  I'm ready to talk like I'm an expert.  I'm just assuming that somehow the nerves in the dead guy's arms are still working.  Oh, maybe.  Well, you know, the nerve...  You have nerve nucleosis, which is when your nerves connect.  But an inch a month, that's about the standard.  It's not 100%.  They have a viscous fluid around them.  I have fake arms, too.  Yeah, I have fake arms, too.  I mean, I'm the only one...  I never noticed that.  Every time you ask him about something that's happening with you, 
[02:29:30]  he goes, oh, I have that, too.  Yeah, that happened.  Yeah, I'm picking flecks to come out of my mustache with my fake fingernails.  He goes, it's called getting older, Gregory.  He could be a little gloomy sometimes.  It's called getting old, Greg.  I work at the hospice.  Palliative care.  Yeah.  I'm known as a real downer at the hospice.  He dresses in a fucking Grim Reaper uniform.  For Halloween.  No one liked my Halloween outfit. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Grim Reaper.  It must have been scary.  A lot of people were screaming.  The Grim Reaper's got his own parking space there.  They just wave him in when he drives in.  Yeah, the guard just lifts the gate.  Gr.  Punches in.  Everyone says hi.  His stupid van.  So that's it on this guy.  It's a big deal.  Yeah, I guess that's...  I would assume they're hoping for maybe like 50% strength or something like that.  I can't imagine they're hoping for a lot more than that. 
[02:30:30]  It's one of those things.  You've got to see how successful everything was.  He could actually lose both the arms also.  They could just rot off of him.  Really?  Yeah.  After this part?  Yeah.  Wait.  It's terrible.  His body rejects them.  Yeah, but to help with that, I think they took the bone marrow from the dead guy too.  Didn't they?  Yep.  Wouldn't your body have rejected them already?  Or how long does that take?  I wish I had a story in front of me.  They give them drugs for that, but then that opens you up for more shit. 
[02:31:00]  Because it really takes your immune system down.  Because they don't want your body going like, hey, we don't know that.  Well, the body's basically saying, fuck you.  We don't want this.  Yeah.  And then you're going, no, we want this.  No, fuck you.  No, we don't.  Can someone get the story?  You're fighting with your own fucking body.  Yeah, it's like, well, it's someone else's body.  It's like, oh, that isn't ours, so go kill it.  You know, your genetic, the genetic makeup in your little cells lets them know that that  isn't fucking from the same thing.  So they go in there, just start fucking killing it.  So when you give the rejection drugs, that's telling your whole body to not fight off a lot of shit. 
[02:31:30]  Not fight off shit.  Oh, wow.  So then you're sitting there with everything going like, hey, let's fucking come in here.  We're confusing the fuck out of your body.  How long do you have to take those drugs?  Forever.  Forever?  Isn't that almost like an AIDS?  Forever, never.  That's what AIDS does.  It knocks your immune system.  AIDS!  It knocks down your immune system, and then whatever you get kills you.  Yeah.  So what's the, obviously this is milder, but what's the difference?  Well, the difference is he had his arms blown off and not a big cock in his ass.  All right.  So there's no need to make it sexy. 
[02:32:00]  But what is the difference between those?  Like, how do you stop with this anti-rejection drug from doing what AIDS does to a person?  Because you have to keep taking the drug.  I don't know.  I guess there's a balancing act they got.  You know, let those, let the smart guys figure it out.  What do I know?  Might get up, have a container of coffee, go to work.  What do I know, Rich?  Well, my regular Joe is a dullard.  What a bore regular Joe must be to hang out with.  Hey, you know what?  You do what you do.  You want to figure out blood platelets.  Hey, get me a roll.  I'm happy.  Right, right.  A roll. 
[02:32:30]  I'm not going to deal with someone like that all day.  Hey, you get me a buttered roll.  I'm happy as a clam.  And he is.  What do I know?  I hate regular Joe.  You do?  Yes, I had to work with him.  It'll take two years before we can see what his final function on the arms is going to  be.  But how about rejection?  Like, is it moving a little bit?  No, yeah.  Like I said.  Oh, no, his arms are moving.  He moved his whole arm up to his face to kind of like itch his.  It didn't look like his fingers were moving, but he was able to get the finger in the right  place to kind of itch his nose.  And he can get down to his wrist on his left hand.  It could still be rejected.  But just that you can itch your nose. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, to me, like an itch being scratched or like, I wonder if he, can he feel it or  can he, is it like a mannequin arm where he sees it and positions it, but he can't feel  it?  I don't play that scratch shit.  You probably can't feel it.  The nerves aren't there.  I itch an itch.  I don't care.  I don't give a fuck.  I scratch a scratch.  I got something going on.  I itch it.  There you go.  Sorry.  I think it's, it would have to just be a natural movement.  Yeah, but he can't feel, there's no feeling in the thing.  Like, I don't know that.  I don't know with an artificial limb. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, but until the nerves come back, he's not going to feel it.  He can feel it.  He'd be able to move it.  I heard you in there.  You said you had a friend what?  Oh, yeah.  He cut off four of his fingers with a table saw.  Is he guitarist in Sabbath?  Yeah.  Cut off.  And do Michael Surgery pick them up?  This is 20 years ago.  Oh, Mr. Zimmerman!  They put his fingers back on, but they put them on different, you know, somewhere.  Like this one, they had to move over that way.  Why?  Why do you have to move the fingers all around?  Because one was so chattered.  You cut them off, and there they are.  Put them back on. 
[02:34:00]  Why did he cut his fingers off?  He was doing a table saw, and he was drunk or something.  Wouldn't he know after the first finger to maybe stop?  No, because when you're doing a table saw, you just go like that.  He just kept going through.  Rich, it's a joke.  I know how a table saw works.  The boss gave a real ass.  Jesus Christ.  You're right.  And you're taking out.  I'm just going for a quick laugh.  Can I have one?  You're taking out about a good fucking eighth inch of real estate from the goddamn thickness  of the blade.  Then it's shattering all the other stuff around it.  Jesus.  So there was a little kid there, and he yells to the kid, go get a bag of ice. 
[02:34:30]  You know, ice holding his fucking flying out blood.  Oh, God.  In the Middle Ages, to torture people, one of the things they would do-  Play this show.  Is they would turn you upside down, and then they would open your legs in an upside down  V, and they would saw through you, through your crotch, and they would turn you upside  down, because this way the blood rushed to your head and kept you conscious.  Oh, that would hurt.  They would saw through your dick and balls into your stomach and through your pussy. 
[02:35:00]  Do you think they'd get right in between your balls, or you'd think like the balls would  flop off to one side, and the guy's all pissed because he got like-  Oh, your cock would get sliced, but they would slowly cut into you.  Oh, now we'd have to do it again.  Oh, God.  I wonder if they'd numb you first.  They wouldn't do shit.  They would just let your fucking-  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, okay.  The best one-  Of course they would numb him.  Numb him first.  The best one I heard was where they get hungry rats, they put them in a cage without a bottom  in the cage, and then put it right on your fucking-  Oh, yeah, your belly.  Your belly.  And they heat you up.  They heat it up. 
[02:35:30]  That was on Game of Thrones.  That one was?  Because I don't watch that show.  Yes.  And the face, too.  They have a mask because they have a face.  They use your rats and they eat through your face.  I knew how to fucking handle people back then.  Torture was great back then.  The worst torture, though, was the fucking-  We talked about this.  Was the iron-  Not the iron.  What's the metal bowl?  Where they would put you in this fucking hollowed out bowl-shaped thing.  Oh, yeah.  And they would heat under it and cook you alive in it, and the whole thing was metal.  You'd just slowly get hotter.  Imagine being surrounded naked by metal as it's being heated. 
[02:36:00]  And there's nowhere to really climb up to get away from it.  You can't touch anything because your whole body-  Ow.  And they would keep you in there for days and torture you.  Like, they wouldn't let you die.  Ow.  That'd hurt.  I bet that'll hurt.  You're just dozing off and it's hot again.  You're like, oh, nerds.  You're not dozing off?  They called it the bowl.  Dozing off.  Like, you just want to take a nap.  They called it the bowl because they designed it in a way so the noise you made when you  scream would come out.  There's air holes.  Oh, so they made it fun for everyone else. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And the pharaoh that had it designed actually tested on the guy who designed it and put  him in it.  What a bunch of pricks back then.  Papa here.  I'm going to do a good show after.  That's what everyone says.  They were a bunch of pricks back then.  Yes, they were.  What are you doing here, sir?  Hey, Papa.  Look at you.  Hi, Tom.  He's got his nice hat.  You do have a nice hat.  Very sporty.  What's that?  It's a fedora.  Rich, what's that to a hat?  What?  What?  I know.  Jesus.  You're looking at it like it was a college diploma. 
[02:37:00]  Was it Perry White?  Perry White?  Perry White was the editor from Superman.  Superman, right?  Okay, it's like a Perry White type hat.  Yes.  Tom Papa, what are you doing at SiriusXM Satellite Radio?  I have, I think my biggest interview for my radio show that I've ever had.  Yeah, I'm not done until 10.  Oh, really?  So, see, I was implying that it was me.  Where did that fall flat?  No, that was all right, Uncle Anthony.  Wait, can we guess?  You can guess. 
[02:37:30]  Let's guess this with Tom Papa.  A movie star.  No.  Oh, someone from the world of music?  No.  A dumb Jew.  Yes.  Wait, an athlete?  What's all over this desk?  Oh, that's Paul's protein powder.  We took care of that problem earlier.  He's so old, that's how it comes out, his protein powder.  Poof. 
[02:38:00]  An athlete?  Huh?  No.  Never in a movie?  Come on.  I don't think so.  So now we've got to go TV.  Well, probably, was he on a reality show?  Yes.  Ah, okay.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  No.  A reality...  He's been in movies.  You said no to movies already.  No, Kevin Hart's been in movies.  Did he, uh, all right, reality show, uh, did he lose to a hack Asian? 
[02:38:30]  Yes.  Ah, let's see.  Ah, boy, this is getting, uh, easy.  Some Jew, reality show, lost to an Asian.  Does he like ironing?  Is that turkey bacon?  Yeah, I want some.  No, thank you.  Turkey bacon.  Ooh.  I love it.  Is that bacon turkey?  He wants him doing a whole thing there.  No, you can have bacon.  Have bacon.  I don't eat that.  I don't eat that.  Turkey bacon is just as fattening, though?  No. 
[02:39:00]  Of course.  Look at it.  It's not as fattening.  But it's not great for you.  A lot of salt.  So you're going to do it.  Voss.  Neither is bacon, though.  Voss.  It is Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Why do you think bacon's good for you?  Bacon's good.  Pork chops.  It's not good for you.  Yeah.  Turkey bacon has a lot of salt.  Cock is good.  Yeah.  Your asshole thing about man is good.  Loss is bad.  Wigs are good.  You guys missed Voss talking about sodium intake. 
[02:39:30]  Stepped all over his great sodium intake.  Damn, I missed that.  He gets so serious when he breaks into his science.  Fuck.  Rich.  Which sodium are you talking about?  Coke or Pepsi?  Dope.  Get it?  You stupid.  That does smell good, Rich.  You want a piece?  It's good, man.  I don't eat turkey bacon.  I don't believe in it.  It exists, I swear.  I know, but I'd go regular bacon if you're going to have bacon. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  And then I'll eat nice after that.  A little salad, maybe with a little dressing.  I'll dip my fork in the dressing.  That's how I do it.  To keep the calories back.  What kind of dressing?  Proud of yourself.  I'm a good, I like the red wine vinegar.  Plain, no oil, or I go balsamic.  I like a good balsamic.  I love a good balsamic.  I like Russian dressing.  I do.  I just like to scream, hurry up!  At it.  At it. 
[02:40:30]  Jeez.  Holy fuck, Jimmy.  Why is this guy on the wire on Fox News?  It's tightrope.  Why is he in leisure wear?  But is he attached?  I'm sure he is.  If they're attached, it doesn't mean shit.  He's not attached.  No, he's over water.  Who cares?  I could fall in water and live.  That I did my entire life in training for Niagara Falls.  Of course, it stays off.  Oh, that's the guy that did Niagara Falls.  Yes.  But he was attached.  Yeah, he's walking over a pool. 
[02:41:00]  And that wasn't his choice, though.  I know, but stupid ABC was all dramatic about it still.  It's like, nothing can happen to the guy.  He was on a wire?  Yeah, and he didn't want it.  But the stupid lawyers got involved.  We should have done it then.  Remember, we were outraged.  Because the lawyers wrecked another bit.  Because the guy said, fuck, I don't want a wire.  They're going to laugh at me in the tightrope community.  I thought when you said attached, I thought you meant he was married.  I didn't know what you mean. 
[02:41:30]  You'll be great after you said that if you dipped your fork in the eggs and they exploded.  Wow.  What the fuck happened?  You think I was a good one?  Attached?  What do you mean?  Study abroad?  I'd love to study abroad.  Where is she?  Oh, man.  Domo Marx.  On a wire. 
[02:42:00]  On a wire.  Laurel and Jewie.  What do you mean, is she attached?  Does she have a girl?  Really?  Rich.  You do that voice well.  I do.  When someone's smashing you, all you got to do is compliment them and it takes away from  the smash.  I ran out of steam anyway, so basically you bailed me out of my next one, which would probably  would have bombed.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  I was just going to get mean.  Have some turkey bacon.  Have some turkey bacon.  I hope you get cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  I have no jokes. 
[02:42:30]  Not a joke to be found.  No, nothing.  I hope you're killed drunk driving.  Why you?  Tom, what else you got going on?  What's going on in your world, man?  Anything?  It's hot out.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's disgusting.  It's really cold out.  It feels like spring.  It's really got a winter coat on.  Everyone's nose is running.  It's wonderful.  How do we live here?  So spring-like yesterday and today.  I hate the winter.  Oh, it will fucking hurt you.  I know.  I'm so impressed.  I don't really do, but just fucking sit at your house and drink. 
[02:43:00]  It's the worst.  You just wait it out.  You do.  It's like you have so much time waiting for spring.  So depressing.  Why do we do this?  Like the first few days where it's cold, I'm kind of like, oh, man.  I light a fire in the fireplace, and I get a little glass of wine, and I look around,  and I think, I look around, and I'm like, this is nice.  I like the seasons.  You know?  This is nice.  And then I realize it's pitch black at 3 p.m.  And I still have five hours of pool time left if it was summer. 
[02:43:30]  I'm like, fuck this fire.  Humans love to suffer, make it worse.  Because, yeah, winter sucks as it is.  And then you're like, you know, let's make it worse by making it dark at 2 p.m.  Yeah, 2 p.m.  It's great.  Right.  You live like a rat for six months.  You just hunker down.  So depressing.  I left my building the other day, and it was 5.15, and it was still light out.  I was excited.  Like, oh, this is nice.  No, it's still horrible.  It's summer. 
[02:44:00]  It'll be 9 o'clock, 80 degrees, and the sun will still be high in the sky.  I like the fucking, in the summertime, like, out in the yard, it's fucking sunny.  Look at my watch.  It's like 8 o'clock at night.  I know.  And it's still bright out.  You're forced.  You feel alive.  Oh, man.  And then when it gets dark, it's time to barbecue.  Like, there's shit to do.  The winter is just opening up the sliding glass door going, fuck, it's cold.  Fuck.  Grabbing some pieces of wood like a caveman, running back inside.  We do it to ourselves. 
[02:44:30]  This is terrible.  Oh, it's just an exercise in trying not to kill yourself for four straight months.  Just until the weather gets nice.  There's a lot of fun things to do in the winter.  You're missing out.  Oh, no.  I like to do.  I do.  What, Jim?  I like to build a big old snowman.  And I like to put a hat on him.  And I like to give him a carrot nose.  And I like to give him two coal eyes.  And then I like to give him a carrot pecker.  And put it right where his penis should be. 
[02:45:00]  And back onto it.  Sounds like a fun winter day.  Yeah, I make viral videos.  Snowman rapes guy.  It's just me.  Ow.  I'm just looking at it all wrong.  Do you know how bad I want to make a snowman fucks guy in the ass?  I want to make that and put his two branch hands on my hips.  Ow.  Ow.  That would be good.  I'm going to do that, but with a baby carrot.  Maybe a little baby carrot. 
[02:45:30]  And call him an Asian snowman.  And then make him fuck me in the ass.  Stuffing a scarf in your mouth.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, winter sucks.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the worst.  You've got to get one of those lights that you sit on.  People in this area are literally sitting under special lights.  The lights you sit on?  They have fifth lights?  Try and not fool yourself.  We've got a guy.  Troy Kwan has the happy light.  Oh, that's right.  And Jimmy tried it on our show.  Yeah.  Does it work?  Yeah, it was great.  It actually cheers you out?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:00]  No fucking way that does anything.  No way that does anything.  Yeah.  You're like a lizard in a habit trail.  Yeah.  Sitting under this light, hoping for joy.  Yeah, what do I know, Tommy?  I just resign myself.  I get it.  You know, it's going to suck.  It's going to suck.  Get through it.  I officially gave up on winter gloves, just because too much shit in my pocket.  So I said, you know what?  I could get rid of the fucking winter gloves, at least.  Right.  I could make it.  Yeah.  Well, just have less shit on you.  I know.  Because I'd rather fucking have cold hands.  You get on that subway, and you've hustled through the cold and ice in your face, and 
[02:46:30]  then you just start sweating underneath all your layers.  You start sweating stupid layers you've got to put on.  By the time you're fucking dressed to go out, you are.  You're sweating.  Then you go out into the freezing cold.  But then you've got to take everything off, because you're getting in your car.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because now the car heats up in 10 seconds, so you go from cold to fucking...  All your windows are foggy from your body sweat.  So now you're trying to take your coat off as you're driving, because why would you take 
[02:47:00]  it off before you start driving?  Right.  But then you...  Yeah, like...  It's so depressing.  Yeah, summer sucks with, you know, throw a t-shirt on and run out the fucking door.  You're ready to roll.  It's the best.  Oh, man.  We're getting there, though.  January is just about behind us.  That's true.  Groundhog's Day.  Groundhog's.  This Saturday.  Is it really this Saturday, Randy?  Yeah.  We're not going to be on the radio for Groundhog's Day this year?  Fuck.  Fuck.  Oh.  Boy, it seems like that shit just keeps coming.  We're like, we always talk about stupid Groundhog Day, and it's like, didn't we just do this 
[02:47:30]  break?  Exactly.  The one bit fucking Bloomberg, and then all the dumb Groundhogs.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl, Groundhog Day, Christmas.  Are you a big Super Bowl guy?  Huh?  Are you a big Super Bowl guy?  You're like watching it and checking out the whole fucking thing?  Yeah.  I'm into it.  Yeah, I love it.  One more day of just to eat bad food.  Yeah, it's like the real final finality to the holiday season.  Yeah.  Do you think?  Like, that's the thing, like, I'm depressed now from the winter. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Once this weekend's over, then it's just bleak.  February, March is when it's really rough.  Yeah.  Yeah, but a good thing at the comic, we get to go to warm places for like three or four  days.  Exactly.  Like, a couple times a month.  I just leave our family behind.  I hope you wind up a nice warm place called the Intensive Care Units.  That's nice.  That's real nice, right?  You know what?  I'd like you to go and swarm the burn units.  That's a good thing to say.  That's terrible. 
[02:48:30]  He's just getting you back from your meanness from earlier.  I wasn't mean.  Oh, God.  Which looks hurt.  You set the tone on this shit.  Besides, I got my fucking February show that I put on every year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's called the February Follies.  He's fucking deranged.  The February Follies.  What happens in the February Follies?  We got events and stuff?  Yeah, I just do like little, it's like a big stage theater show, and I do like a bunch 
[02:49:00]  of like little vignettes.  Oh.  Fake ice rink.  Sounds nice.  Yeah, fun things.  Like little fun sketches.  You're saying.  Follies.  I do.  We have singing, dancing girls.  Oh, that sounds fun.  It's Follies.  Fake snow.  Fake snow.  Like a Busby Berkeley movie?  I don't know who that is.  It's that guy that made all those movies where the girls are on the stage and they're walking  around in circles and there's another circle in the middle and they're walking around.  Love circles.  It's like a lot of aerial cameras looking down on dancing girls in their form. 
[02:49:30]  They sound like walking girls.  You know, they do things.  All that shit.  Yeah.  It's a long show.  We have like, it opens up with like a sketch.  Uh-huh.  Comedy sketch.  Yeah.  And then there's a 90-minute dance number.  90 minutes?  With you in a top hat?  No, it's with a bunch of dancing girls.  Yeah.  And they're just doing the can-can for 90 minutes. 
[02:50:00]  It's 90 straight minutes.  I was watching an Abbott and Costello movie the other day.  Nice.  And they're at this like a club, of course, at the beginning.  What was it called?  Oh, it's the newer one?  Abbott and Costello drain the pool.  See, because Luke Costello, his kid, drowned in the pool.  See?  Abbott and Costello check the skimmer.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's Abbott and Costello in. 
[02:50:30]  Call that ambulance.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Lou.  Abbott!  Abbott!  There's a...  Abbott!  There's a...  Abbott!  There's a pool!  There's a...  Lou!  Abbott!  There's a...  Lou!  Abbott!  We're in the fence, Lou!  Abbott!  Call me!  Call me!  Abbott!  What do you mean, Lou?  What's happening in the pool?  Hey, fella! 
[02:51:00]  Abbott!  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Rich can't even laugh at that.  No, no, no.  Rich has kids.  Makes them feel bad.  Yes.  He creates a pool every time he speaks.  There was a part in the movie at the beginning with this club, and there was a guy, and he's  singing, uh, me and my shadow. 
[02:51:30]  They had a black guy dressed in all black, top hat and everything, dressed in the same  thing the white guy was dressed in, but only he was dressed in black, and he was a black  guy acting out as his shadow.  Oh, no.  I'm like, this shit's great.  Can I ask this?  We were so old ladies.  Why is that racist, do you think?  I don't know, but it is.  This is funny, right?  No, it's relegating the black man.  People say that's racist.  If you did that skit on SNL, they'd be...  Because they'd say that you're relegating the black man to the position of just the  shadow of a white man. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, maybe for that skit.  It's degrading.  Like, if you did it today, it actually would be less offensive.  Yeah.  Back then, there was just pure intent of...  Oh, believe me.  Oh, now...  Oh, believe me, yeah.  Hey, get that spade to the stage so he can do my dance number, my song and dance number.  Where is that spook?  You know damn well when the camera wasn't rolling, it was even more racist.  That's right.  Ah, damn it.  Where is he?  Just held outside in the sun, outside of a studio. 
[02:52:30]  Just chained up outside.  And I was thinking, like, I'm watching this fucking movie, and they did, like, a ten-minute  song and dance number with, like, the Andrews sisters and shit, and I'm thinking, who fucking,  like, sat in a theater to go see an Abbott and Costello, like, a comedy, and then you  gotta see through this song and dance number.  Yeah.  Fucking weird.  I know.  The Marx Brothers is that way, too.  Yeah.  Well, it's so comedically beholden, and then you go and you watch it, it's like, 12-minute  long, this woman just walks, dancing, and guys tap-dancing behind her, and this big production 
[02:53:00]  number that has nothing to do with why you went to that movie.  Where's the comedy?  Where's the comedy?  Yeah, I go to see a comedy, and it's a musical.  Well, they cranked out so many studio films back then, it just cranked them out.  And I think they had certain people under contract, so they just shoved them in movies.  It's like, oh, what is this one?  It's a drama.  It's a crime drama.  All right, where can we put the dance number?  What?  Okay, we'll have the detective go to the club. 
[02:53:30]  It's always at some fucking club.  But that's not how the script goes.  Well, that's how it goes now.  That's how it goes now.  Hire me a spade.  I need one to dance.  We're making a comedy.  What are we going to make?  We're going to make a fortune.  Put the Andrews sisters in it.  We don't care.  They were the go-tos.  Bugle Boy shit.  Boogie Boogie Bugle Boy?  Yeah, yeah.  They were terrible.  You didn't like them?  I'm distracted, because they're unveiling the BlackBerry 10 right now, as we speak. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, wow.  Yes, there's a guy in a horse stable, and he's shoveling the BlackBerry 10 out.  Are the lines pretty long at the BlackBerry stores?  Garbage.  Oh, that's right.  They're just unveiling it, and they're trying to get some excitement.  What can they possibly do?  You're done.  Well, it's trending on Twitter.  People are saying that it looks damn cool.  Ah, use it in your horse-less carriage.  Isn't this a couple years too late?  Yeah.  I'm a huge BlackBerry guy.  I'm not going back.  I love my Samsung. 
[02:54:30]  The old BlackBerry's making a comeback.  Ah, look at that.  You can feel the buttons.  We like a tactile.  People like having a tactile.  No, they don't.  They get over it.  Immediately.  You get a smooth fucking glass screen.  Yeah.  That's a happy day, Johnny Business.  The BlackBerry's back.  I did like that slight click.  No!  Every time you hit those letters, it was kind of nice.  It's terrible.  I do miss that a little bit.  I don't think they have that now on the BlackBerry.  That's what made me hit in the store.  I'm trying to find a video. 
[02:55:00]  I think they finally went with the complete iPhone ripoff, to tell you the truth.  I think they did.  No raised buttons.  BlackBerry 10.  I spend half my life editing what I write on my iPhone.  Is that it?  Is that what you use it for?  No, just anything.  Any message, anything.  It's like five attempts.  Now it's close to being right.  Yeah.  I can't find anything about it.  Yeah, exactly.  No actual shit.  Modern wonder.  I guess maybe they're still unveiling it. 
[02:55:30]  That's why.  No one cares about this fucking phone.  Now it's trending.  People are very interested.  Join us at 8 a.m. for the launch.  Is that...  It's 943.  No, but that was 10 minutes ago.  Oh, there it is.  Rim to unveil.  It looks like that.  The battery's rim has been losing customers.  A lot of them.  The stock price has been taking a hit.  It's been laying people off.  It had a network outage a few years ago.  Several, in fact.  That to the ire of many BlackBerry users. 
[02:56:00]  And then you look at BlackBerry's market share in 2009.  It was 20%.  Well, guess what?  It's now 5%.  The CEO told Fortune, we have to win our customers back one by one.  So this is big that they're...  How did you lose it, you fucking assholes?  They're taking this to the Super Bowl at this point.  In fact, Rim bought a 30-second spot, Carol.  And as you know, Super Bowl commercials are set to go for almost $4 million.  This is the first for Rim.  We'll see if it works.  Alison Cossack, if it's a new stock exchange.  It's just an iPhone ripoff that won't be as good.  Or stay with us for the Senate hearing on gun control.  Jimmy, they worked hard on that. 
[02:56:30]  No, it's just the iPhone.  You're right.  It's a complete iPhone.  That fucks up Apple's stock, I'm sure.  No, I don't think...  Why not?  It'll take a little bit more away from the iPhone.  It's time to buy.  But who's going to even bother?  Huh?  Who's going to bother with the Blackberry?  Huh?  The unveiling is at 10.  Was that on the air?  Huh?  Was he on the air, though?  I think so.  I heard it.  No, I did hear him.  Were you on the air, Yorick?  Yeah.  So I was trying to listen to Anthony. 
[02:57:00]  What were you saying?  I forgot now.  I get so confused.  Yorick bowled me over.  And then I'm going, hey, because the unveiling is at 10.  What?  I thought you were doing a bit.  I thought you were ignoring a kid.  And all that in Costello a bit.  Yes.  I really like, huh?  Who's on mic?  Huh?  What?  Fatso.  Who's mic?  I don't know, Mike.  Nothing else, Tom Plopper?  I don't know, Mike.  Anything else?  You hate winter.  You're depressed. 
[02:57:30]  You're watching the Super Bowl.  You're depressed.  I'm depressed and sweaty.  Seasonal depression?  Yes.  No.  I've got to get out of here.  I don't think that's real.  It's so nice.  It is real.  You think it's real?  It's real.  Seasonal depression?  Yeah.  You go to sunny places now, people don't look like us right now.  They're not pale.  They're not drawn.  They're not napping seven times a day.  Yes, I just sleep.  They're excited.  I do napping a lot.  They're in athletic clothing.  The girls are beautiful.  There's sunshine.  Swimming.  It's fucking great.  They're not skipping shaving and just trying to get through it, drinking. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, man.  Why can't we make it better?  I know moving, obviously, but...  Yeah, that's just it.  There's no other way to make it a little better.  Well, does it add to our soul that we go through it?  Are we deeper and more...  They got their own problems, though, when it's sunny every day.  That must fuck with you after a while.  Yeah, it just gets so boring.  My tan's too perfect.  Exactly.  I'm skin cancer.  Golf again.  Right.  No, but I like it.  I like a good cloudy day, though, every once in a while. 
[02:58:30]  It's such a nice tan over the summer.  It was so nice.  God.  Oh, I looked like a million bucks.  And it comes on you like that.  Now you look like $1.50.  What, Rick?  Nothing.  It's just horrible.  Like, you're playing golf.  You're having a great time.  And the next thing you know, it's snowing.  It's so fucking depressing.  And Bonnie takes the kid out to play in the snow.  Like, they go hiking.  You got it as a parent.  You got to go out in the snow with your kids.  You don't do that. 
[02:59:00]  You don't play in the snow?  What's wrong with you?  You're a kid.  You got to do it with your kid.  We were throwing snow around the other day.  It was nice.  I liked it.  I'd be like, you take them.  I ain't going outside.  I ain't going out there.  Fuck that.  You teach them the snowman, the snow angel, the tobogganing.  I'm going to sit here and fucking drown my sorrows.  When it snowed on Friday, at the end, like it was around 5 o'clock, it was snowing in the city.  And my daughter had two little girls over.  And they're like, we go outside?  Sure.  And I walked them down. 
[02:59:30]  And I stood in the lobby and just watched them through the glass.  And there were the other parents.  Prison visits.  The other parents came to pick them up.  And they picked up the other girls and they're looking around like, where's the adults?  And I'm just in the glass.  How you doing?  I'm in the warmth.  Going out there.  When I was a kid, my dad, we went to a pile of snow.  My dad taught me how to make a snow pussy.  And he said, you got to put two little grapes so it looks like ice.  And then you're fucked. 
[03:00:00]  And then you're fucked.  A snow pussy.  Oh, my dad made me a nice little snow cave when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He piled up a fuckload of snow, right?  Packed it down with a snow shovel.  And then dug out like an igloo.  Yeah.  We all bore me.  And I was like, oh, this is cool.  And then the kid from down the street came over.  And he goes, oh, check it out.  And he went to sit on it.  And he jumped up on it.  And it collapsed in.  Were you mad?  I was so fucking mad.  Actually, I was more sad than mad because I just started crying and ran inside. 
[03:00:30]  What I usually would do.  My father called me pissy eyes.  Told me to stop crying again.  Pissy eyes.  Son of a bitch.  What the fuck are you crying about?  A humorous snow dump.  That kid that jumped up on there was the kid whose mother was raped and murdered.  And the friend burnt the house down down the street.  That's humorous.  That makes it humorous.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  Find somebody else's snow casterly ruined.  Exactly.  That kid so deserved everything that happened to him after what he did to you.  You're right. 
[03:01:00]  Well, I hope it might have been a bit much.  You're absolutely right.  I see it your way.  Igloo karma.  We did the igloos right next to the fucking busy street.  That's where all the packed snow was.  All right.  These cars are flying by.  Our igloo's like only a few feet away.  Yeah.  Our parents were cool with it.  You're looking at your little hole.  No one thought about safety.  And the roads are still relatively, you know, icy and unsafe.  And here's our igloo five feet away.  No one thought about safety. 
[03:01:30]  No, we didn't grow up with safety shit.  What?  We didn't build an igloo.  You built Ig-Jew.  You know, my stupid building when I...  An Ig-Jew.  Yes, unless you're performing, you built an Ig-boo.  You do bring up...  Thanks, Jim.  You bring up a good point about safety.  And we didn't have it growing up.  I'll leave my building with my bike without a helmet.  And it's a big...  Whoa!  Without a helmet?  You go biking?  You're a rebel.  I'm like, I'm a middle-aged man.  Will you shut the fuck up?  I've survived this long biking without a helmet? 
[03:02:00]  They say that to me when I walk out without a helmet.  Whoa!  Walking without a helmet?  They're very protective.  You have a bike.  Do you put on that bike?  Bike clothing?  The tight pants?  No, I don't, Rich.  I don't talk to it many times in the show.  Listen to the fucking show.  I'm babysitting.  No, I don't.  That's the Lance Armstrong shit I make fun of.  I love that stuff.  Nice white bike shorts and a fucking Cialis.  You could hang in the playground with sunglasses on.  Smelly sweats.  Roll up one of the fucking legs so it doesn't get in the... 
[03:02:30]  ...with the spokes and I'm off.  I got a man, like breaking away.  Not even spokes.  Like breaking the cutters.  Wow.  And the pedals.  That's all I'd do.  And I'd get a workout just like those fucking assholes.  Yeah?  How much do you ride?  How far?  Oh, in the summer, like, I'd go ten miles a stretch.  Three or four times a week.  Not the same old.  Because I like it.  Not biking now for another six months.  No shit.  Because it's ice.  I'll probably be out there today.  You get one or two a month.  One warm day.  One or two a month. 
[03:03:00]  And everything's wet, so it's just spraying up on your ass.  Oh, right up your back.  I don't have that guard on my bike, so it goes right up my fucking back.  Right, exactly.  These assholes go, ugh.  Biking went out a helmet.  I'm like, well, what's wrong with you people?  You're about the same age as me.  You don't remember this shit.  You hop on your fucking Ross or Huffy bicycle and ride through the woods in the street.  Right.  You fucking ride your bike out without anything.  Anything.  Still alive.  No.  Still alive.  And I've seen some fucking war wounds when I was a kid when kids would come limping 
[03:03:30]  home.  It was just blood pouring out of their foot or their elbows, their face.  Someone took a hit, man.  I was on a handlebar or something.  My friend's bike going down a hill.  And we fucking wiped out.  Wiped out.  Going down a big fucking handlebar.  Oh, really?  What happened?  You got distracted.  You passed by a library and you went, what's that?  Did you have a sissy bar and a banana seat?  Ooh. 
[03:04:00]  The banana seat was cool.  I never went with those bikes.  I had a 10-speed.  Stingrays.  Yeah, yeah.  The Stingray was the bike to have.  I didn't have those.  The high-handlebar banana seat.  And, yeah.  The sissy bar.  And you'd have, like, the stick shifter.  Right.  For three-speed or five-speed.  Oh, fuck yeah.  The stick shift.  I can't remember that.  That would always fucking wind up eating your nuts at some point where you'd do an endo.  They were badass.  Oh, yeah.  You could do a wheelie on that.  You looked really cool.  And we could set up, like, ramps in front of our house. 
[03:04:30]  And the parents would never like, hey, it's dangerous.  What?  With, like, wood with nails in it.  Yeah, you'd just find some shit from the construction site that was going on where they were tearing  down more fucking forests.  Into a cinder block.  Yeah.  A cinder block and a piece of bendy.  Why would?  Hey, what engineer went behind?  What engineering went behind your ramp construction?  How did you know the incline to put it out of it?  Well, we found something that was this high.  Right.  And that's the incline.  And we pushed the fat kid first.  And that's it.  That was it.  We threw Harvey off our ramp in a wheelchair. 
[03:05:00]  Harvey.  He was in a wheelchair.  And we just fucking, and we just pushed, pushed, and just, he flew.  Just flew.  Why would you do that?  Out of the chair?  He wanted to.  He wanted to.  What was wrong with him that he was in a wheelchair?  He was crippled.  It was probably polio.  Oh, I understand.  For what?  I bet it was one of those old boss diseases from the fucking, before they cured it.  His brother found a gun.  His brother found a gun and shot, you know.  His brother found a gun and shot him?  Well, it went off.  They were little kids.  One of those things.  Yeah.  You're for gun control then?  Am I?  Yeah.  Assault weapons.  Oh, stop it. 
[03:05:30]  Well, your theory about it, if the government comes after us, that's bullshit.  Because if they come after you, they're going to fucking win.  It doesn't matter how many assaults.  It's not about winning or losing.  Didn't you ever hear my point on that?  No.  The point is that without an armed populace, the government can just, with a pen, do whatever  they want to do.  As long as the populace is armed, the government knows they'll win, but they know they have to  kill Americans in order to win.  They won't do that because it ends America as we know it.  If the government uses the military to start killing its people. 
[03:06:00]  So, it's a detente.  It is a balance of power, even though it's not balanced.  It still balances out because you either have the government having to kill its own people,  which negates America right there.  End of story.  Or a government that could do it with the fucking stroke of a pen because the population isn't  armed.  Do what with a stroke of a pen?  Take a lot more power.  Negate more of the Constitution.  Put government in place of the places they're not supposed to be. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Did you see that special on drones?  I did.  I just saw that last night.  We started this.  Those are scary.  Drones.  Yes, I was very excited about that.  That's going to change everything.  Guns aren't going to mean anything.  No, the drone thing is...  The drones are coming.  We all have our own drone?  Fucking cool.  We have our own drone?  I have a great drone right now.  Yesterday, I installed the retractable gear on it.  So now that the camera can't be interfered with no matter which direction it's facing. 
[03:07:00]  It's fucking nice.  You have a drone?  You send it out?  I fucking absolutely do, yeah.  I can send it out on GPS, where I just, on the computer, just send it.  It'll go out wherever the fuck I want to send it.  Comes back.  I can just flip a switch.  It'll come back to where it took off from.  I can control it remotely.  I have a video view of where it is, where it's going.  I can see it, even though it's gone.  I can just control it through the TV screen.  How far does it go?  Fucking miles.  So why aren't they using that in the hood to do drugs? 
[03:07:30]  They're trying.  They're going to be the...  Drug dealers should have that.  Oh, the drug dealers should use it.  Well, you should put the GPS in.  You can fucking deliver your drugs.  The drone comes back.  I was thinking that.  There are some horrid things you could do with this.  Yeah.  It's coming.  They have...  Hopefully some peeping Tom shit.  The navigation system that works off the computer where you can just put in waypoints, and this  will go to the waypoint at whatever speed you want, whatever altitude you want, and it  could change all those parameters in between all the waypoints, and then once it gets to 
[03:08:00]  a waypoint, it can just sit there and then do, through a timer, whatever you want it to  do.  So if you want it to drop something, it'll go somewhere, wait a little bit, drop it, and  then turn around and go.  You got a droppy thing on yours?  I don't have one, but they have them.  And you could get the droppy thing?  And you could tie it into the navigation system so it knows where it is.  They're going to be so illegal in two years.  All I'm thinking is, like, what?  They're going to make them illegal.  Prison yards.  Yeah.  If you could have somebody drop guns.  Guns or bubble gum or whatever someone can shoot guns.  Or write Hubba Bubba.  Treats. 
[03:08:30]  Treats.  Yeah.  Bags of protein powder.  A law book so they could study to maybe get out of there.  But that's just, like, one thing.  But they were saying, like, 911's going to be able to use it for, like, if there's a fire  in an apartment building, they'll send, like, 20 drones into the building.  They'll go scour all the rooms.  Yes.  There's people there.  Oh, wow.  And so the...  So, but then you think, what's the evil application of that, right?  Yeah.  So then you can just blast it in and...  There's always an evil application. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I read a great article.  All new technology, they end up using it for porn first.  Porn?  Porn first.  Absolutely.  You fly it in, get click pictures, zip back out.  Oh, yes.  The number one thing they did after they invented the printing press was to print up some fucking  porn shit.  You know, the first fucking words they put in there were fuck.  And then they finally started going, all right, it's cool for porn, but now let's, all  right, let's fucking do legit shit.  Don't check it out.  Fuck.  Right.  Fuck.  Fuck.  It just keeps...  Let's go.  Go.  Fax machine.  People fucking realized right away they could put their boobies and their assholes on it. 
[03:09:30]  How long can it stay up before it has to come in?  About a half hour.  That's it, a half hour?  Yeah, the batteries are pretty restrictive.  You gotta have a balance out.  That's a home use one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The ones that they have are fucking...  Yeah, they want to make them so they can just stay up for months at a time and like  hang over Pakistan and you can just watch it.  And you could send it how far from your house?  A couple miles.  This is a home kit.  Yeah, yeah.  And you could just spy on people through the drone?  Yep.  You have a camera on it?  Yep.  Camera on it.  High definition camera.  Camera that takes video and the downlink which I can see what the camera sees and I can 
[03:10:00]  control the camera.  I could just leave it hover in one spot and I could turn the camera around or I could lock  the camera on in one direction and then no matter which way the drone moves, the cameras  are going to stay exactly where you have it set.  What do you use it for?  Spying.  Yeah?  On my neighbors.  Have you seen cool stuff?  Uh, it was, I've been not too cool with stuff.  My neighborhood's kind of fucking dull.  Right.  I got to take it in a good neighborhood.  But I did chase a guy, a pizza delivery guy down. 
[03:10:30]  And then when they opened the door to get the pizza, the people in the house kind of  were looking like, what the fuck is that?  No way, really?  And then I just kind of took off.  I posted that video online.  Oh, check it out.  It's really fucking kind of funny.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, a lot of that shit though.  It's fucking, it's, it's, it's a, it's a fun hobby mostly.  I'm not, I don't have it to spy on people, but there was this animal rights, uh, guy  and he had a bunch of drones.  Oh yeah.  Right.  And he was hovering over these guys that were shooting birds illegally or something. 
[03:11:00]  And so he sent the drone over and they're hovering above these hillbillies and they're  firing.  And then they saw the drone.  Then they took the drone out.  They shot it down.  Shot the drone down.  Yeah.  So then he just sent out more.  He had to send out more drones.  Yeah.  He kept sending out more.  They sent out more.  That's the thing.  It's like all these private people are just have their own agenda of why they want to  use these drones and they're sending them out.  Like obviously it's a little more higher end, like what I have than most consumers can  get.  But in a couple of years, it's going to be pretty much open to a lot of people. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  I'm not quite NASA at this point.  Um, I was testing out the retractable skids and, uh, the first time I flipped the switch  and they went up, it knocked my beer bottle on the floor.  And smashed it.  And I had nothing to say with a mop, mopping up my spilt beer because my retractable gear  and it's being recorded.  It's about three feet.  God, even the drone is trying to tell you something.  In diameter.  Get the hands.  Holy fuck.  I don't think you need this. 
[03:12:00]  Now the robots are talking to you.  Holy fuck.  Robots trying to take my beer.  Jesus.  You've gone too far for the robot.  We've got to get out of here because Jimmy's got his show.  Yes.  Jimmy's got a show.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got his advice show in a couple minutes.  Nice.  A little switch over and then Jimmy does his thing and he's got a special guest today.  Bradley Jay, right?  No, Bailey Jay.  Bradley Jay.  Oh my God.  You know what I do?  I do that every fucking time.  We work with Bradley Jay in Boston.  In Boston.  He was a good guy.  He had a big cock too. 
[03:12:30]  Very strange, weird guy, but I liked him.  Yeah.  I get to go interview Rich Voss.  Bailey Jay, I'm sorry.  And then Tom Popp is interviewing Voss.  Voss is going to be at the Stress Factory Thursday through Saturday.  Ooh.  Then Barnard for the film festival February night.  Athena Film Festival.  February night.  Athena.  Athena.  Athena.  I'll be there supporting.  Athena.  You got my credit right?  Yes.  Nice.  Producers.  Nice.  Oh, look at that.  Nice. 
[03:13:00]  I got a piss.  Is he going to recoup his money?  No.  Got, uh, yeah.  Got Rosie's release like that.  We're all set.  You think you're going to give me my money back?  Yes.  If it had to come out of my pocket.  Nah, I would never ask that.  Oh, good.  I never even signed it.  Jesus.  That's how much I trust you.  Where am I going?  Nah, I'm kidding.  All right.  Jimmy, you want to promote the other thing before you start your show?  Borgata, February 17th.  Early show sold out with me, Artie, Amy Schumer, and Dave Attell. 
[03:13:30]  Late show's on sale.  And then February 22nd, 23rd, myself and Dave Attell are in Vegas at the MGM Grand Theater.  Ooh, do a tell.  Do a tell.  Tom, this was nice.  A nice little surprise.  Yeah, thank you.  Yes.  It was nice to see you guys.  You promote anything besides...  I'll be in Denver at the Comedy Works, Valentine's Weekend, and the Stress Factory February 21 through 23.  Ooh, nice.  Telling jokes all around.  That's what I do. 
[03:14:00]  Did you do that song before?  Yeah.  For my follies.  For my follies.  Ooh, telephone.  Oh, good to see you guys.  Stay tuned for Jim Norton.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at a phone, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor. 
[03:14:30]  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  It's very frustrating wading through those commercials.  I mean, but they are needed.  It's amazing how self-important I've become. 
[03:15:00]  Like, I love commercials because I go and take a leak.  But when they're interfering with my ability to talk, I get upset.  So, the Advice Show, Bailey J, I guess, is on her way.  She's not here yet.  So, I guess we will begin without her.  Because I can't make the whole world wait, as we like to say.  We don't like to say that.  I just say it.  So, if you have any questions, please call the number.  They just gave it out.  Iraq, who do we have so far?  The phone lines are always lit for this very important program.  Yes, they are lit.  They're just in the process of screening.  So, it's random right now. 
[03:15:30]  Put number two through.  I don't care who it is.  This is line two.  774, you're on with Jim.  Hi.  Hi, Jim.  Hello, miss.  Yes, what's your name?  My name is Allison.  Hi, Allison.  And what's your issue?  Okay.  Okay.  Five years ago, I had a breast reduction done by choice.  Boo!  Boo!  Sorry, go ahead.  I was very, you know, happy with the results.  When I had it done... 
[03:16:00]  Well, Allison, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  How big were they?  They were over a double D.  Are you a big girl or a small girl?  I'm actually a petite girl.  I had them reduced down to a B, but you'll be glad to know that they actually grew back.  So, you went from double D to a B, and then what did you do when your boyfriend immediately  left you?  Jesus.  I had a Mercedes, but I drove it into the lake and got a Pinto.  I figured you'd be happier with that.  So, what happened?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Allison.  I apologize.  Well, like I said, you'll be happier. 
[03:16:30]  They've grown back, so I'm big trusted again.  Anyway, I was with my boyfriend when it happened.  We were together about three years at that point, and he was fine with it.  No big deal.  Fast forward three more years.  We had a six-year relationship.  We finally broke up.  We thought we were going to get engaged, that whole thing.  So, now, it's been about two and a half years since we broke up, and I'm finally starting  to realize it's okay to move on, and I can start dating again. 
[03:17:00]  What I want to know is, do I tell potential suitors about it?  About your breast reduction?  Yes.  The reason I asked this question dates back to a conversation I had my freshman year of  college with a guy friend, totally unrelated, just a random conversation where he told the  story about how he hooked up with a girl, and when he took her bra off, he was kind of  taken aback, because she had had a breast reduction, and he was taken aback by the scarring  on her breast. 
[03:17:30]  Where's the scars?  When you have a breast reduction, the scars are kind of around, a little around your areola,  and then they go down, and then they go under.  It's like a, it looks like an anchor, it's called an anchor scar.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Well, I don't think you have to tell them that right away.  Hi, where are you from?  Well, I grew up in Schenectady, but I have an anchor scar on my tits.  What's your name?  You know, you don't want to wait until you're in love.  But I don't think you should tell them right away.  There's a balance with that.  Go out a few times, and maybe after you fool around the first time, say, look, I don't 
[03:18:00]  know if you'll care or not, but I have that.  Some guys won't care.  Some guys might.  But I wouldn't tell them right away.  I don't know what the rule is, because you might bang somebody the first night.  How do I know?  Well, I literally don't, but what if I did?  You know, I would be, that makes me nervous to think, like, what if I take it off and a  guy is like, oh shit, that's a deal breaker.  Well, I mean, that's how I feel every time I take my shirt off.  So I guess you'll know what it's like to be Jim Norton for 30 seconds.  Most guys won't care.  And the few that will, big deal.  I mean, it's not going to be that many that care. 
[03:18:30]  I'm sure your tits feel and look great.  So, you know, I wouldn't go crazy about it.  Okay.  Feel people out.  I don't think there's any pat answer for that.  Different people will react.  If a guy, if you're talking at dinner and the guy is like, oh God, do I love tits?  Perfect big tit.  Then you go, well, look, you know, here's an issue.  But, you know, you might go out with someone a few times and decide you don't want to fuck  them.  So there's no need to tell them.  Okay.  All right.  But you can only, you can only send pictures to your friend, Jim.  I actually almost emailed you and sent you pictures like to, like to ask you like, does 
[03:19:00]  this look bad?  You know, whatever.  Well, please do.  I'll give you an honest medical answer as I crank to him.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Bye, Allison.  Bye.  Who's next to you, Rock?  That was random and it worked out well.  It was a girl with giant breasts.  Just so you know, Bailey's here.  They're walking her down.  Okay, good.  She'll be here in a second.  All right.  Let's talk to Kevin in Philly.  Hi, Kevin.  Hey, what's up, Jim?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Thanks. 
[03:19:30]  So, I think my issue is probably not that uncommon, but I just turned 30 last fall.  No, that happened.  That's not uncommon.  Well, I guess that's true.  Okay.  Thanks for the advice.  Godspeed.  Be safe.  All right.  You're almost hung up on you.  No, I'm kidding.  Go ahead, Kevin.  And, you know, I've had throughout my 20s a series of sort of stop and start relationships  that don't go anywhere.  And I feel like the issue is that I just, I can't look at a woman without sort of objectifying 
[03:20:00]  her and wanting to seduce her and kind of, I like to chase.  But then once I get there, I'm bored.  I'm totally bored.  Yeah, I completely understand that.  It's a weird thing where the situation can turn you on.  But once you get the person, it's not what you wanted or not what you thought it was going  to be.  That sounds like a little bit of a sex and love addiction type of thing, actually, where  you start, where you're not necessarily looking at the person. 
[03:20:30]  You're looking at the high around getting them or whatever.  So, Bailey just sat down.  We're talking to this guy about...  Oh, wait.  There we go.  Hi.  This guy is basically is not interested in people once he gets them.  Oh, okay.  Once the attraction is...  The attraction wanes after.  And I kind of understand that.  Do you ever try sex and love addiction?  You ever think about that, sir?  You mean going to meetings?  Or do you think that might affect you at all? 
[03:21:00]  Uh, it might affect...  I mean, I have this feeling where I, you know, as you talked about it before, where  you don't want to give up a part of yourself that you're so used to.  So, no, I haven't considered it, but it definitely has affected my life.  It's, you know, it has effects on intimacy.  I mean, I'd much rather, you know, have sex with a complete stranger than somebody that  actually likes me and cares about me after a few months.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it's like, when you're dealing with an addiction, it seems like whatever's inappropriate 
[03:21:30]  is the high.  Like, I like to say, I like a prostitute to say I love you to me, or I like a regular  girl to be a total whore.  It's always looking for what I don't have, or always looking for what feels wrong, and  that's always about just looking for a new high, I think.  Women have that, too, though, actually.  I've noticed that I think a lot of guys, they, it's always in reference to guys, but  like, a lot of girls, they're obsessed with the guy, they really like the guy, they tell 
[03:22:00]  other friends they like the guy, and then they get the guy, and then they're a cunt.  They're like rude and mean, and they're, they over-romanticize the guy, and the guys do that  with girls and pussy.  Like, they romanticize it, they're like, oh, this is so hot, and then once they get the  girl to do it, it's like, alright, well, I tricked you to show me your pussy, even though  you've been taught your whole life not to show me your pussy, now I'm done.  Like, now I'm over it.  So it's not about the sex, it's almost about the power of getting them to do what they  might not be inclined to do.  That's how I have that, I think I'm like that, I have that a little bit. 
[03:22:30]  It's the conquest.  The conquest, personally.  That's exactly what it is, like, when I, even when I've been in relationships where a  girl treats me perfectly, and I'm actually, I recognize that I'm happy, if I go out to  a bar with my guy friends or whatever, I love flirting with girls, and if a girl approaches  me and talks to me, I, you know, I play the game, and I love the chase of it, and seeing  if I still have it, and I just worry that, I thought by this point, by 30, I would have 
[03:23:00]  to have well in that, but not even close.  Does it interfere with your ability to have good relationships?  It blows a lot of good things for you, right?  It does.  It definitely does.  Yeah, I've done that too, man.  Like, how many nice people have I chased out of my life because there's this thing that  I need to satisfy, this, this, uh, this little nagging part of me that I need to, like, how  many nice relationships have I walked away from?  How many great fucks have I passed up just because the outside nonsense didn't match up?  It's crazy. 
[03:23:30]  It's insecurity, right?  Part of it's insecurity, and part of it is, uh, you know, just liking that high, because  a part of it is, like, you know a girl will fuck you, so you don't want to fuck her,  but when you don't know if she'll fuck you, or if she has a boyfriend, then we want to  fuck her twice as bad.  So what you're saying is, it just, that, that never goes away?  No, I think it's a part of addictive behavior, because I have that, and I don't think everything's  addiction, but I, I think I'm almost, when you do that, you're putting yourself in a position  where you can never be happy, and you can never get what you want, so it, there always  has to be the chase, and that's what addiction is. 
[03:24:00]  It's chasing, uh, what is not really apparent.  You know, you're drinking, you're chasing that first drunk, or when you're, when you're,  uh, you're getting high, you're chasing that first high, well, this, you're chasing this  feeling, uh, that you're probably never going to get.  That's what it sounds like.  That definitely, you know what, the recognizing that you, that it's your behavior shows that  you're, like, not necessarily a reactionary person, like, it shows that you're, you're  aware of your actions, like, there are a million people that do this constantly, they  have no fucking idea they're doing this, because they don't self-probe, um, in a platonic 
[03:24:30]  way, they don't self-probe, yeah, so they, so they, they have no clue they do this, they'll  just, they'll do this until the day they die, but, but the fact that you're aware of  it, uh, shows that you might want to change it, and, and I've, I've never been against  therapy, I'm always pro-therapy, so if there's anything you want to reprogram, or any patterns  in your life that you think are, are self-defeating, go to therapy, I mean, therapy, it sounds  like such the kiss of death, of, like, I am such a homo, like, I'm not going to therapy,  but therapy's awesome, it's really, it's, it's expensive as shit, it's like a hundred 
[03:25:00]  dollars a visit, but it's, it's worth it, I mean, I think.  All right, sir, good luck to you, my friend, but that's not a bad idea at all, just try  therapy, because it, it's like, you know what, there's a million things to do, it sounds  like addictive behavior, um, I would address it just because you're going to be in the  same boat when you're 40.  Right.  That makes sense.  All right, thanks, Fatso.  Bye, Kevin.  Who are you thanking?  Was that me or Eric?  I'm sorry, Eric.  Um, all right, well, welcome, Bailey, by the way.  Hi, how are you?  I'm good, how are you?  You look lovely. 
[03:25:30]  Thank you very well, I got really prettied up for the radio today, because I'm smart.  It's all right, it's nice.  You know, made sure to get all gussied up.  I was running late, and it's hard to get in here, like, there's lots of, there's a whole  situation downstairs of, of metal detectors and people and things, it was, so yeah, so  I'm late, I'm sorry.  Does Joe, does Joe DeRosa give you the creeps?  Joe DeRosa is, is.  Because Joe's obsessed, I love Bailey J, but Joe's obsessed with Bailey.  Every appearance he talks about it.  Joe, Joe, yeah, yeah, I'm a big part of his act, which I, I, I, I'm a big part of  part of his act, which I, I appreciate.  I, I really love Joe. 
[03:26:00]  I, I like, I like Joe.  I'm sure he's waiting for my husband to die at any moment so he can come in and comfort  me.  Yeah.  But, um.  And Joe doesn't just want to fuck you.  Yeah, he, no, but he wants to comfort you.  You're right.  That's the, that's the, I think that's the fucked up part.  He doesn't just want to, like, nut on my face.  Like, he wants to marry me.  I feel like he fantasizes about me in a wedding dress more, more than anything.  Yeah.  So, yeah, he's a, he is a creep, but I, I, I like him.  He wants to hold your chin and kiss you.  Right?  He wants to wave by my, my, my bedside table when I have breast cancer. 
[03:26:30]  Like, he, he fucking loves me.  So.  So, yes, he creeps you out as much as he creeps the rest of us out.  Yeah, he's a creep.  He's a creep.  But I, I, he's a good person.  I can tell he's a good person.  So, I hope.  Who's next?  Thank you, Bailey.  That makes me very happy.  Walker in Cincinnati owes you an apology, Jim.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Who's Walker?  Hi, Jim.  I'm from Cincinnati.  I was in the Comedy Cellar.  Okay.  And I used to go in college quite a bit.  And I didn't know you had to have reservations, because in college we always just walked in. 
[03:27:00]  So, I walked into the upstairs restaurant and put my name in.  And the lady was on the phone.  And I turned around, and you and Bob Kelly were having dinner.  So, I said, hi, big fan.  Bob Kelly made a joke about me and you sharing the same chin.  And then, uh, then I just stood at the bar by your table and looked like I was hovering over you.  But I was waiting for the lady to get off the phone.  And I think you talked about on the radio the next week about people bothering you while you're eating.  Oh, I don't remember, dude.  If I did, I probably didn't mean it seriously. 
[03:27:30]  I don't mind a fan saying hello.  So, um, so, you know.  No, no, no big deal, brother.  I appreciate you being a fan.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  My advice would be never, my, here's my advice.  Never approach Bob Kelly when he's eating.  That's where you went wrong, sir, is that you fucking really took a chance.  Yeah, I decided to fucking, I decided to smack this alligator in the mouth while I had fucking food.  I couldn't think of good food that alligators eat.  Good improv, Jim.  Who's next?  This is Megan in Buffalo.  By the way, you know that Bob likes you, too.  Oh, yeah.  I fucking love Bobby. 
[03:28:00]  But, yeah, yeah, Bobby is, I think Bobby's in love with me.  Do you find that, uh, I'm asking Bailey, of course, everyone knows who Bailey J is.  I don't need to tell you.  But do you find that guys, uh, will react differently to you than they would tell their friends who react to you?  Yes, oh, my God, yeah, okay, this is my thing.  You know how everybody spends about 45 minutes a show debating whether or not they would fuck me?  No one is sitting around talking about, would I eat Roseanne Barr's asshole?  Right.  Because they don't fucking want to eat Roseanne Barr's asshole.  So, do they want to fuck me? 
[03:28:30]  No, no shit they want to fuck me.  I got fake tits and I take it in the ass.  I mean, it's really not a stretch, but.  It's a great bumper sticker.  Anyways, that's all.  That's all I'm saying on that note.  It's, yeah, Bobby loves me.  I love Bobby, too.  You, Bobby, and Joe have been nothing but nice to me.  And I super appreciate it.  Thank you.  Have I been the least creepy of the three?  The least creepy?  Hmm.  I know I've not been as creepy as Joe.  You know what?  I'm going to say you haven't been as creepy.  You know, Bobby calls his penis a hog.  That's the only thing that.  That's what we call Bobby. 
[03:29:00]  And that's the only, no, but no, seriously, no one's been overtly creepy.  Everyone's creepier in theory about me when I'm not in the room and they don't know I listen to O&A.  That's when they get creepy.  And I love it.  I think it's hilarious.  But when they talk directly to me, I get treated like a lady.  It's nice.  Everyone's, like, afraid to be too sexual with me.  Right.  And I'm like, oh, no.  People bust on my face for a living.  Like, you know, I can roll with the punches.  You can tell me what you want to do to me.  Like, I get emails like this every day.  What a trooper.  I'm a trooper when it comes down to it. 
[03:29:30]  Who we got, E-Rock?  Megan in Buffalo.  Hi, Megan.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  I'm fantastic.  Oh, my God.  I love you guys so much.  I always listen to O&A.  And you're one of my favorite guys, I swear to God.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  So this is the thing.  I've been with my boyfriend for about a year.  He's just turned 30.  I'll be 30 in a couple months.  And he's got ED.  He's got what?  ED?  Yeah.  Oh, his rods don't work.  Okay. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  And they're not really sure why.  Like, he went to a doctor.  And the doctor was like, oh, it's in your head.  Yes.  I don't know.  He's really in his head.  Like, there's diabetes in his family.  Like, maybe it could be that.  It's probably...  Anyway.  Listen, I don't know him, but I'll say this.  I've had many issues with that, too, over the years.  A couple of things are happening.  Either he likes...  He's just afraid of his performance.  Or he's a masturbation addict.  And porn is how he...  He's used to making himself cum while he's limp.  And he abuses his dick.  Or there's something that he wants that he's afraid to ask you for. 
[03:30:30]  It probably is in his head, though.  Like, when you give him head, does he get hard?  No.  Not fully.  Like, there's...  But a couple of times where he's gotten hard enough, where I'll just kind of jump on top  of him real quick.  And then he goes, you know, just real fast.  That's why.  Because you're putting pressure on him.  Like, you're making his erection the focus of the entire experience.  And he probably does that, too.  The way to do it is to play around and not make the erection the fucking ball drop New 
[03:31:00]  Year's Eve moment.  You know what I mean?  Like, here it is.  Hop on that cock!  Like, you're putting too much...  You're basically saying to him, hey, look, baby, it's okay.  There's no rush.  And it's just getting hard.  His dick's kind of coming out, probing around.  And you're like, don't worry.  Oh, look, it's hard.  Hop on that cock!  Miss, you gotta relax with it.  Suck his dick a little.  Play with him a little.  But don't...  And mean it.  Don't just say it's not the focal point and then jump on it. 
[03:31:30]  Go through a few experiences where you tell him just to relax, we're not gonna fuck, just  play.  What do you think?  Bailey's in a very unique position here because you deal with them and you have one.  I have a penis, yeah.  So it's...  You know what, though?  I also...  I do porn, so I know what it's like performance anxiety.  And feeling like, get it hard, get it hard.  That feeling, it can be really intimidating.  And even...  I mean, I don't have a problem getting a hard-on.  And when there...  If there is kind of a, you know, make it happen tension in the room, I'm like a noodle. 
[03:32:00]  I'm just like not in it at all.  Have you tried Cialis or Viagra with your boyfriend?  Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.  He...  When we first started dating, he waited like three or four months and he was kind of like,  you know, this is the only way I can get hard.  And I was like, well, okay, you know, we'll work with it.  But the thing is, like, when he takes Viagra, like, it's...  He gets really, really sensitive.  And then, you know, it's pretty quick.  But he'll, like, he'll, like, go down on me until, like, I come. 
[03:32:30]  And then it's, like, all about him.  Does he have a big dick or is he average?  No, he's got a nice dick, yeah.  Okay, so he's probably just self-conscious.  This is all in his head or most of it's probably in his head.  I've suffered from it at times.  Because, again, the times I'm freest sexually...  The times I'm freest sexually and my dick works the best is when someone does not expect anything of me.  And that is, um, it's, like, that's why massages...  My dick is like a rock during massages because I'm totally free.  I'm totally not self-conscious.  I'm in control.  I don't care if my body doesn't look perfect. 
[03:33:00]  I don't care if I don't fuck right because it doesn't matter.  He's self-conscious.  Don't make his dick the focal point.  Um, and let him know that it's okay if he just wants to jerk off and make himself cum while you play with his nipples.  Or don't make his dick the focal point.  Eventually, I think you'll find that that helps.  If he's one of those guys that's not afraid to touch his ass or have other people touch his ass, I mean, that's such a good way to go with that.  I mean, I've known guys that don't really like to jerk off cum, like, that whole thing.  And, like, you just make a kind of a... 
[03:33:30]  I don't know if you're down to eat your boyfriend's ass.  Most girls are not.  But, I mean, I don't...  Not really.  Well, I mean, it's...  Maybe out of the shower, but I don't know.  Yeah, fresh out of the shower, maybe.  You know, guys are fucking gross.  So, obviously, you don't want to eat just any guy's ass.  I just meant, you know, on a special night.  I'm weird, though.  I'll eat my husband's ass.  Like, I like eating ass.  So, it's...  I don't know.  But, you know what?  It's not for everybody.  I'm not going to lie.  That's true.  That's true.  Ass eating is like fucking...  It's like foreign films.  You know, people who love it love it.  It's not for everyone. 
[03:34:00]  Well, thank you for...  But, again, help him relax because that's his problem.  Okay.  Well, thanks so much, man.  I appreciate it.  Okay.  Goodbye.  Well, I forget your name, but you're in Buffalo.  Megan.  That's okay.  That's all right.  Bye.  Bye, Megan.  Who's next, young Iraq?  Mark has a question that only you can answer for him.  Okay, great.  Little Jimmy.  Hi, Mark.  Hey.  Actually, the question, I think, is more so for Bailey J.  Yes.  Which my wife has found and loves. 
[03:34:30]  Bitches love it.  They really do.  Oh, yeah.  You have been in the bedroom with us many times and not know it.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Wait, let me ask you.  Let me ask you.  You and your wife fantasize about Bailey kind of in a threesome way?  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Most women, I found, would fantasize about fucking another guy.  But transsexuals, I found, freak women out because they were almost afraid that was an energy they can't compete with.  In general, I think they don't find it attractive. 
[03:35:00]  But my experience is women masturbate to women.  However, sometimes a woman wants to see a dick, but she doesn't want to jerk off to some fucking brute asshole dude who's not that aesthetically pleasing.  So then I've got nice tits.  I've got a soft voice.  I'm not going to try to rape them.  And then they get to jerk off to me and whatever.  Oh, okay.  I never thought of that.  It kind of makes sense.  I get it.  Because most of the girls I know who are heterosexual rub one out to chicks, as opposed to just like, you know, Scott Nail standing there with a heart.  I'm like, what are they going to do?  They're not going to jerk off to that.  Okay.  So what's your question for Bailey?  I'm sorry.  Well, and the thing is, part of the big fantasy is actually Bailey with me. 
[03:35:30]  In other words, I'm taking it from you, which would, trust me, would be very incredible, but that's part of her fantasy.  But what she's been trying to do is, as Jim eloquently puts it, has been trying to peg me.  Wait, she wants to fuck you.  Okay, here's what's happening.  She's gearing up for a divorce, and she wants you just to get ready.  She wants you to get ready for what's about to happen.  She wants to peg you with a strap on.  Yes.  Nice.  And she's tried, and trust me, it's very hot, very erotic, and I do want it very bad. 
[03:36:00]  But the thing is, it hurts like a motherfucker.  It does hurt like shit.  It does not feel great.  How can I, what can I do to relax or to let it happen?  Because I do want to be submissive to a point where I'll let her do that, and I want her to do that.  But it's been very hard.  Maybe Bailey can answer this question for you and for me, sir.  Actually, this advice is going to be ridiculously obvious and down to earth, but it's going to be practiced by yourself for a while. 
[03:36:30]  And, I mean, you know, when you're jerking off or whatever, even if you just get a finger in.  But, like, don't super pressure yourself.  Like, chill out unless you're a recovering alcoholic.  Have a cocktail.  Don't be like, I have to do this.  Relax.  Finger your ass.  Put a vibrator in your ass.  Something that's going to just, like, loosen you up.  Like, really don't feel any pressure.  Because, obviously, if you're tense, your asshole's going to be tense. 
[03:37:00]  So just relax.  When you're by yourself, you don't have to worry about shitting.  You don't have to worry about whatever the horrible, embarrassing thing that's going to happen is.  Because guess what?  You know how disgusting you are.  So if you shit, you're not going to embarrass yourself.  And so you just relax.  Open up, literally.  And just enjoy yourself.  And if it sucks, you don't like it, don't do it ever again.  And if it's awesome, then have your wife fuck you in the ass.  And start small.  Girls, all girls want a dick.  So when they get by a strap-on, they get a fucking, just, traffic cone to ram in your ass. 
[03:37:30]  Don't.  Start small.  And work your way up.  What about, let me ask you this, too.  This is curiosity.  An enema.  I've never done an enema.  I've done an enema.  Do you think that, does that help before you get fucked?  It doesn't help so much.  Will it stop you from shitting, though, all over somebody?  Well, here's the.  Well, actually, it would help if you do a wine enema.  Yeah, right?  You'd be fucking dead.  They, yeah, so I, I see, okay, enemas seem really far, like, really out there.  And, like, because I do porn, I think a lot of people think I've, like, done all this crazy stuff. 
[03:38:00]  The only person who's ever fucked my ass is my husband.  Like, I'm really not, like, that out there.  And so, but I, I had recently, in the last couple of years, tried an enema, because my husband boffs me, and I, I didn't want to shit on him.  Right.  And so, um, don't get a, if you're going to do enemas, don't get a fleet enema with saline solution in it, because all that does is loosen the stool and give you diarrhea.  And it's terrible.  So, if you are going to use a disposable enema, dump it out, rinse it out with warm water, and then use, I don't know if this is, this is just what trans women do, and I've known a lot of escorts that do this. 
[03:38:30]  Um, they put warm water in it, and then squirt it in, and then it just kind of helps push everything out.  You do it a couple times to flush everything out.  Um, I have a reusable enema now, which I clean.  And, um, but it's a hit or miss, because if you don't get all the water out, then the guy bangs your ass, and it doesn't feel good, because there's pressure.  You know what I mean?  So it's, I haven't gotten it down to a science, but I know, I know girls that swear by enemas, and they say that it takes the literal pressure in the stomach out.  So it just, you're able to really enjoy getting reams, you know, more, without also having to worry about them pulling out and you shitting all over them. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, it's where you fucking, your helmet's wearing a little hat, if you like to say, a little Lincoln hat.  Oh, God.  Thank you, sir.  Well, I'll definitely let you know how it goes when you come to Charlotte, North Carolina, because I have my tickets, and I will be seeing you there.  Oh, thank you, my friend.  I will be there, um, in, uh, March 7th, 8th, and 9th, so I appreciate it.  Come up and say hello.  Absolutely.  Thank you, sir.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  All right.  Who do we got next, young Ellie? 
[03:39:30]  We have Brian in Boston.  Hi, Brian.  Hey, Jim.  How's it going?  How's it going, Billy?  Hi, there.  Hey, um, I have a pretty difficult question, and it's more just me getting it off my chest, uh, and, Jim, if you could help me out with this, it'd be great.  Um, ever since I, I've been, I went through puberty, I have, uh, had inorgasmic ejaculation.  Um, that is the inability to ever come, uh, wait, pre-orgasmic ejaculation? 
[03:40:00]  No, in, uh, oh, I'm sorry, okay.  Um, and, uh, I mean, through intercourse, through, uh, masturbation, it just doesn't happen.  I never reach orgasm.  Oh, no.  And, uh, there was no care for it, unfortunately.  What is your question? Are you looking for a rope store?  The problem is, is, is this, is, um, my wife wants to have children, and, um, I hate, I hate kids. 
[03:40:30]  And I, and I expressed this for, um, since I was young, you know, we've been married seven years,  and I've been putting it off, putting it off, and we have great sex, you know, it's just, um,  uh, you know, she wants to have children, so I'm like, all right, I'll give you one kid.  And, um, so the procedure is, is the only way they can, they can extract my, my semen 
[03:41:00]  is they have to cut half of my, one of my balls.  Oh, fuck.  And, um, and put it in a prosthetic.  And I don't want to go through that procedure because it, it can lead to male breasts and,  you know, and, and a lot of other issues, health issues down the road.  And, and I'm just wondering, I mean, is it worth staying married, you know, in my situation? 
[03:41:30]  Because I love her to death.  And she's put me in a condition where I can't provide her a child if she wants a child.  If she, if she said it, listen, if it doesn't happen, that's great.  But she says it in a point where, like, she always puts it onto my lap like, I'm the asshole.  Let me ask you a question, sir.  Because, again, I've never been married, and I don't want kids necessarily.  Um, I don't think she's unreasonable to want a kid, but I also don't think you're unreasonable  to not want your boss sliced in half. 
[03:42:00]  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  Would you, would you two adopt?  I mean, is there, is, is that such a crazy option in a situation like yours?  No, no, we, we actually export adopting.  The only issue is it's, it's, it starts at about $40,000.  Oh.  Okay.  How old is she?  I mean, we get, it would just take, and, and, how old is she?  Yeah, Bailey, Bailey asked how old she was.  How old is she?  She's 32.  I'm 35.  Well, I mean, it's not as soon, I mean, if she was 38, I would be like, dude, slice your 
[03:42:30]  balls open.  You owe it to her.  You gave her the, you know, the best years of her life, and she, I don't know.  I mean, it kind of seems like it should be open for discussion.  I mean, because slicing your balls in half, I mean.  Yeah.  I'm a transsexual, and I'm like, oh, God, mutilating your genitals?  Like, that's, that's insane to me.  That sounds really, what if you get divorced, and you still got a half-sliced ball?  What if it's uncomfortable sexually after that?  Right.  And, and, um, I, I mean, I just, I just don't know what to do, and, um, and it's, it's, it's 
[03:43:00]  go time right now.  It's either I do it or I don't.  Let me ask you, sir, did you, did you guys, when you got married, you obviously told her  your condition.  What was her take on kids then?  Oh, she was like, oh, well, you know, like, oh, that's okay, that's cool, and the second  we fucking got married, she's my language, um, and she, you know, she's like, oh, I want  children, I want children, I want children.  Right.  Her tone, the second we got married, and now I'm trapped, you know, and I'm like, what  the hell, you know, and, and, and now she's, she, now she makes it to a point where we 
[03:43:30]  haven't had sex in three months, and she's almost like never letting me have sex now,  because, um, because I'm not giving none of the kids.  Because she's mad at you, yeah, she's holding out because she's angry.  Oh, that's so stupid.  Yeah.  That's so dumb.  Because then you're just going to cheat.  I could never do that because I have the whole male libido thing, so I'd be like, I'm not  going to have sex with you, and then five minutes later, it's like, I don't want to jerk  off, and then I have, I give in immediately, I've got, like, no sort of willpower with  that sex.  You have zero ground to stand on when it comes to that. 
[03:44:00]  Exactly, yeah, I'm like such a douche about it, but I, the thing is, she's only 32 years  old, so, I mean, if you, could you imagine your life without her?  Could you imagine you two going a separate way and her finding somebody that, that would  be more into having a baby with her?  I even told her, I said, listen, if you'd be happier going and having a kid with someone,  go, you know, like, whoever, but I'm not going to keep her back from having her  dream.  How about in vitro, is there another way for somebody else to knock her up, or you guys  don't want to do that? 
[03:44:30]  I guess I'm a selfish prick, because I don't want to raise someone else's kids.  Okay, yeah, I understand.  Well, your biology, I mean, you'd be, you know, biologically designed to, like, eat that child  if it doesn't look like you, so that makes sense.  I mean, and speaking of all, I hate children.  I mean, it's, like, they're not a penis, they're not a wife on you.  It's true.  You know, you know, I don't know, but.  Imagine having, you know what, God bless you.  Imagine having to deal with a kid, and you don't even get to cum first.  Like, at least when you got a kid.  Like, you could look at this little monster and go, well, I did get to blow a great load. 
[03:45:00]  But with no you, I get to cum.  Yeah, I think you should either adopt or fucking separate, dude.  I don't know what to tell you.  That's a rough one.  Yeah, that is a rough one.  Good luck, my friend.  Bye.  Poor guy can't cum.  How terrible.  I know, I can't imagine.  I'm like, I, like, jerk off five times a day.  So, like, not cumming.  I just can't even imagine.  Like, that's, that sucks.  You don't deserve to have horrible kids in your house.  You can't cum.  Life sucks.  Don't have a fucking screaming asshole in your house.  Like, an ingrate.  Yeah, if you can't cum, how do you know when to throw somebody out? 
[03:45:30]  I wish this guy was still here.  All right.  Who's next?  Let's talk to Grady in Maryland.  Grady?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, Grady.  So, I've had this friend.  Now, he's my roommate.  I've known him for, like, four or five years.  And everyone, like, that I talk to, he's a real bad dork.  He gets drunk.  Everyone thinks he's gay.  And I'm pretty sure he is.  Okay.  He's an asshole because he won't, you know, come out of the closet or whatever.  So, I don't know if I should be like, look, I don't care.  Just be gay and stop being an asshole. 
[03:46:00]  Well, you might want to ask him, take him aside.  I don't know.  You know, I imagine that's a hard decision for people.  Well, you know, that's a tortured existence to lead, man.  You know, you look at, like, a guy like Ed Koch, who was rumored to be gay.  Oh, right, right, right.  And he still won't answer the question.  But, I mean, some people never come out.  Some people do.  I don't know.  Some people feel like it's a bigger statement to not feel obligated to come out.  But then there's some people who are, like, completely in denial.  And every person I've ever known to come out, everyone around them goes, dude, we have, like, we're not headless. 
[03:46:30]  We know you're a fucking flaming homo.  We know you're gay.  And so I've never had anyone be genuine.  I've never seen anyone genuinely surprised when someone comes out, usually.  Right.  You can usually tell.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I guess.  And he knows that all of y'all are comfortable and there for him.  I mean, there's, like, this network around him that that would be fine.  I mean, it sounds silly that he wouldn't come out.  Yeah.  I think so.  I mean, but he's always all pissed off, walk around the house.  He'll be, like, text fighting with someone.  I'm like, oh, who's that?  And I'm like, a friend. 
[03:47:00]  And we've been boys for four years.  That's why we say a friend.  Or just, you know what?  Just accept the fact that he's probably tortured with the decision.  If he turns into an asshole, that's one thing.  Right.  But accept the fact that it's hard for him to do.  And when he's ready, he will.  Because it's a huge fucking step.  And it's fear.  It's fear of rejection.  It's fear of, like, everyone treating him different.  Like, I'm assuming.  But this is just my take on it.  It's just, and in American culture, everything's been designed with, like, gay is the worst thing you can be.  Like, it's, I feel like the culture's just always been that way. 
[03:47:30]  Like, that's gay.  Don't do that.  Pink shirts mean you're gay.  Like, everything that isn't even having sex with men is gay.  And it's just, like, certain words are gay.  Certain inflections are gay.  Haircuts are gay.  So it's just everything's been brainwashed.  Like, do not be gay.  So when you are gay, you're like, fuck.  I can't tell anybody.  Or maybe he's just not attracted to you at all.  And he's afraid if he comes out, you're going to want to fucking drink out of his mule.  So maybe you can just tell him, like, I have zero attractions for you.  He doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  I would say give him time, man. 
[03:48:00]  That's a huge one.  And if he's your friend, you know, just give him some time.  I'm sure he'll come around.  Right on.  You coming to D.C. again soon?  I am.  I miss the D.C. Improv.  I love that room.  It's one of the best rooms in the country.  So, yes, I will be back soon.  Awesome.  I'll see you there.  Okay, buddy.  Later.  Bye.  Who's next to you, Rock?  Do you want to do that?  Or do you want to?  I'll do it at the end.  We only have one more to do, right?  Yeah, that's the only one.  I'll do it at the end.  Okay.  This is Doc in Texas.  Oh, I'm not going to say it.  Hello, Doc.  Welcome to the program, Doc. 
[03:48:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Okay.  This is a terrible long story, but I'm going to make it real short.  Yes.  I got shot twice.  I come back home.  The VA puts me on Zorro for some anger issues, go figure, that I have, which it's going well  with, you know, talking and everything.  But here's the kicker, Jimmy.  When I fuck my wife, I can't come. 
[03:49:00]  I mean, it takes forever.  I mean, it's an hour, hour and a half before I get there.  She's worn out.  She takes me down.  She's bucking me off.  She tells me to go away.  I talked to Dr. Steve about it.  She said, well, the VA can give me this pill for that.  Jimmy, I'm sick of pills.  Yeah.  Well, first of all, I'll suggest this, because again, whatever Dr. Steve said medically 
[03:49:30]  is probably right.  I would say two things.  One, she should not make it about her, because if it's pills, it's pills.  Right.  And second, more important, is this is a luxury problem.  Like, look at, this is a good problem.  You've been shot twice, and your biggest problem is that you're fucking your wife for 90 minutes.  That's not a bad way to go. 
[03:50:00]  Well, it's not a real big problem, right?  But, you know, I don't want her to, I don't, the end game for me, Jimmy, is I told her, this  is not a shoe.  This is just part of my, and I'm going to get off the show off.  Yeah.  You know, I'm talking to the VA, you know, we're having our little powwow and we're loving  and all that, but, you know, I said, it's not you, but I said, now, when I get off the  show off, you know, it's going to go back to the 20 minutes to the 40 minutes, it's not  the ninth minute. 
[03:50:30]  I said, it's up to you.  What do you want me to do?  Because some days, Jimmy, she'll write me for the two hours.  The other days, it's like, you know, I, I told, well, what is your take, Kyle?  I mean, should I, I would suggest, because I'm not a doctor, I don't know enough about  the medications and what you're like, what the Zoloft does for you, but I would just suggest  a guy like Dr. Steve is much more qualified because I don't want to say get off the Zoloft  because the next thing you know, this guy's, you know, arrested for fucking putting a poster  of his wife's vagina, fucking killing her, but I, I would just, uh, whatever Dr. Steve 
[03:51:00]  suggested, I don't know enough about the medications or what they're doing for you, but, um, look,  there's a lot worse problems to have, so, um, maybe you find another medication, you need  to find alternate medications.  Oh, yeah, talk to your doctor about it, is what it sounds like.  Yeah.  Yeah, I would suggest just, you know, tinker with the medications, but don't do anything,  uh, drastic. 
[03:51:30]  I'm just, I don't know enough about it, I don't want to give somebody terrible, there's nothing  worse than somebody pontificating about pills where they just don't know what they're talking  about, so I'll be honest, I don't know.  Good luck, my friend.  Keep, I would say, just keep, keep plugging away at her.  Keep fucking her.  Keep fucking her.  Good, my, good man.  All right, thank you, buddy, be good, and congratulations for making it back alive.  Fucking shot twice, good for you.  Be good.  Who's next?  Uh, this is Keith, he has a question about stand-up.  Okay.  Keith.  James Joseph. 
[03:52:00]  Hi, Keith.  Hey, it's Keith, you're a Mac consultant at the Skydaway.  Oh, hi, buddy, how are you?  Good, hey, Ben.  Good, good.  Um, question for you, um, you're always picking my brain about my, uh, avenue of, uh,  back support and stuff.  I actually wanted to pick yours, because I've always been a huge fan of comedy.  Growing up, I always looked forward to, like, the HBO, uh, comedy specials.  Sure.  Like, all the, like, an hour of unknown, up-and-coming comics and stuff.  Yeah.  Um, I don't really have any material of my own. 
[03:52:30]  Um, I used to do a lot of community theater, you know, I've done radio, but I used to have  my own college radio show.  Um, so I'm really good at giving presentations, but I don't have any material of my own.  And there's, like, this one old HBO show, I think it was, like, 80 or 81, from comedians  that really never went any further than that show.  Right.  A lot of guys I made big after that.  And I know you guys are, you know, but all the comedians are talking to you, and Bob 
[03:53:00]  Kelly, and Jim, and everybody are all talking.  You know, it's always, like, this anathema to, like, be stealing other people's material.  Yeah, don't do it.  I was just, I was just wondering what your thought was for, like, just for, like, an open  mic night for seeing if you're able to present someone else's material well.  No.  I, I, Keith, I know what you're saying.  I, I, no, no, listen.  I understand what you're saying.  I understand what you're saying.  But what you're doing by doing that is you'll learn nothing.  Because if it goes badly, you won't know if it was just his shit material that you couldn't 
[03:53:30]  sell.  And if it goes well, you'll be too scared to go away from it because you'll think you  found a formula that works.  It's not going to teach you anything.  If you want to learn, here's what you do.  You want material?  Write down material and try it.  You cannot not take the risk.  You're looking to do something and somehow avoid a huge part of it.  And a huge part of it is finding what's funny to you and writing it down and then seeing 
[03:54:00]  if it translates to an audience.  Because you obviously have thoughts every day, what you think is funny, what you don't  think is funny.  Write down what you think is funny.  Give it a shot in front of the audience.  But you can't cut that out by taking material already that's been proven as funny and just  seeing if you can sell it.  So I understand why you're saying that, but trust me, the temporary high it will give  you is not worth what you're robbing yourself of.  That's actually a really interesting perspective because I didn't think about it from that 
[03:54:30]  way.  In fact, it's funny.  I'm actually doing some Mac support for Vinnie Brand.  So I was actually thinking about asking him, you know, going up whenever they do an open  mic.  Do one of the open mics, tape every set, and realize that bombing is okay.  All right, buddy?  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  I'll talk to you soon.  Okay, Keith.  Take care.  Good luck, man.  All right.  Bye.  We have some time, right?  We're running out.  You got to do that.  We only have a couple minutes left.  I'll do it after the next call.  Okay.  Is there any girls on the phone?  No.  Or someone that the two of us could help? 
[03:55:00]  We could go to Jay in Maine.  Hi, Jay.  Hi there.  Hello.  Hey.  Big fan.  Well, basically, I just want to make this quick.  Ever since me and my ex broke up, I haven't been able to get hard, and I got pretty much  a good offer from what I want to call a 9 or a 10 yesterday, and not only did my fucking  dick not want to work, it shrank. 
[03:55:30]  Your phone cut out, but I understand what you're saying.  It just shrank.  Was your ex a great fuck?  Oh, well, yeah, I mean, not like...  That's a no.  You think that's a no?  That's a no.  It was up there in the top, you know?  I mean, crazy shit, but...  Maybe you're just nervous, dude, or maybe you're not done grieving.  Your dick told you something.  You didn't want to have sex in that moment with that person, so your dick was just kind  of telling you, hey, not right now.  You probably thought you should be hard because she's hot.  I'm learning this is incredibly common, because nine-tenths of the calls are like, I have 
[03:56:00]  a soft dick.  Yeah, no, I mean, I was with a chick for almost five years, and after that, one for two, but  yeah, no, right after, fuck a week after, I ended up getting mine, but no, not this time,  and it was only a pretty short relationship.  I don't really know what it is.  Your mind is telling you something.  You're probably not ready.  Well, you're just scared.  It's okay to be scared, dude.  We're all scared. 
[03:56:30]  Men don't like to acknowledge fear, but we're afraid we're not going to perform well enough.  We're afraid we're not going to be good enough.  Right.  Well, you're just feeling too sad.  Maybe you're a little sad, or maybe you're just not ready to fuck a new person.  Maybe you need to be in a relationship before you fuck.  But there's all these weird things that we don't allow ourselves that women allow themselves.  Hey, you know what?  That's a good point.  I appreciate it.  Love you, man.  Thank you, brother.  And Bailey came in today.  My show is only, we have to wrap up because my show is less than an hour, but with commercials.  No, right, right, right.  But I like Bailey very much, and I want you to come back and do it again. 
[03:57:00]  No, any time you want me here.  And what is your podcast?  You do a very good podcast with Matt, your husband.  Yes.  And it's on Bob Kelly's network.  Where can people hear you guys?

Mask sexual flavors.  It's the new way to foreplay.  Let's be honest.  It's a revolutionary intimacy.  And I'm just kind of improv-ing this.  A revolutionary intimacy enhancement product designed to help couples enrich their sex lives  and their relationship.  They're flavored gel strips, and they dissolve on the tongue, and they block the tastes, sometimes  associated with oral sex on a man and his subsequent climax. 
[03:58:00]  You get it?  Nobody likes the taste of jizz.  So what you do is you put this on your tongue, and it dissolves, and it makes the taste of  jizz more palatable.  It drastically improves the experience for both partners, because, again, this way, you  can just relax and enjoy it without having to worry about her going like, because who  wants to deal with that shit?  She's like, she's trying to look for the handle on your car, and she spits half of it on the  car window.  You know, you get it?  She's blowing you while you drive her home. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  It makes the experience both.  And for her, she doesn't have to worry about getting sick and having that horrible bleach  breath.

And then the next night, she's like, well, I'd like to suck your dick, but I can't because 
[03:59:00]  I don't have a gel strip.  So now you're like, here you go, stupid.  Here's gel strip number two.  So it's available in watermelon, strawberry, mango, and chocolate.
