<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about *Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol*, fueled by Jim Norton's unfamiliarity with the franchise.  The hosts debated the realism of the film's stunts, comparing them to those in *Unstoppable*, and engaged in a side conversation attempting to locate an image of a *Ghost Protocol* actress online. This led to a discussion of a promotional photo of Tom Cruise on the Burj Khalifa, prompting a broader discussion about extreme feats performed on high structures, including videos of Russian daredevils and tightrope walkers.  They also touched upon the challenges of booking guests, mentioning difficulties scheduling actors from *Ghost Protocol* and Adam Sandler.  A listener named Katie called in, resulting in a humorous exchange about her Michigan location. The hosts then made a joke about Jerry Sandusky, leading to a discussion of the ensuing controversy with Margie Phelps and Ann Coulter. They played a recording from a phone number mentioned by Sandusky's lawyer, which turned out to be a sex line.  A news story about youth football coaches resigning after their team burned their third-place trophies was also discussed, along with a critique of a commercial promoting sportsmanship and the "everybody wins" mentality in youth sports and its societal implications, relating it to the Occupy movement. Jim Norton was a guest in the studio throughout this segment, and Brett Ratner was mentioned.  The conversation was liberally punctuated with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The show continued with a segment focusing on over-competitiveness in youth sports, sparked by the trophy-burning incident.  The hosts criticized parents who prioritized winning over teaching children about handling loss.  They discussed a team strategically benching its starters while leading significantly, highlighting the undermining of competitive spirit.  The discussion broadened to the issue of overly sensitive parents and their impact on children's development, touching upon political correctness, zero-tolerance policies, and the resulting disconnect between childhood and adulthood.  They connected this to their own radio experiences, highlighting how a vocal minority can influence decisions and silence popular content.  This segment also included a lengthy and explicit discussion about E-Rock's recently bleached hair, featuring off-color jokes and reactions from both the hosts and a montage of female SiriusXM employees' reactions.  E-Rock was in the studio during this segment.

The next segment delved into a variety of topics.  A sexually explicit conversation about blowjobs ensued, along with a host recounting an awkward spanking experience. The hosts debated the dangers of texting and driving, discussing potential legislation and technological solutions. They reviewed past Time Magazine "Person of the Year" selections, debating the choice of Adolf Hitler in 1938 and comparing his influence to Albert Einstein's.  A phone call from a listener identifying himself as David Berkowitz, son of the "Son of Sam" killer, led to a lengthy conversation about his name, experiences, and stand-up comedy attempts, including replays of previous calls.  Jenna Rose, Penthouse Pet of the Year, was a guest in the studio.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit commentary about her physique and interviewed her about her personal life and preferences.

The subsequent segment focused entirely on the studio interview with Jenna Rose.  The conversation was highly sexually charged and detailed, revolving around her experiences in the adult film industry, sexual preferences, and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Notable moments included discussions about a scar from an ectopic pregnancy, a detailed description of her ideal sexual encounter with Mark Wahlberg, and numerous sexually suggestive comments from the hosts and Jenna.  The hosts involved Chip and intern Matt in the sexually charged banter and physical interactions with Jenna.  The conversation touched on her entry into the adult film industry (including a scene portraying her mother), her personal life, and preferences.  The hosts attempted to take and share photos of Jenna on social media, encountering technical difficulties and censorship discussions.

The show concluded with a discussion of the aftermath of Jenna Rose's visit.  The hosts discussed intern Troy's physical interaction with Jenna, contrasted with intern Sal's disappointment at not receiving the opportunity.  Chip called in, claiming sexual contact with Jenna, providing sexually explicit details. His account was met with skepticism and humorous responses.  The conversation then shifted back to Eric Nagel's bleached blonde hair, with various opinions and reactions, including a montage of reactions from other SiriusXM employees being played.  The show ended with a story about Opie's encounter with a violent homeless man, highlighting his nonchalant approach to filming the incident.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  E-d-dang over here, don't listen to the D-dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, morning people. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Hi.  Hi everyone.  Hi there.  How's everyone doing today?  If they're not answering again.  Don't ask them questions.  They can't hear you.  Just forgetting. 
[00:01:30]  Jim Norton just arrived?  Yes, Jimmy.  He was out in Los Angeles.  I saw Brett Ratner.  Yeah, says hello.  Bumped at him in a first place.  How you doing?  Good old Brett Ratner.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he still in trouble?  He's doing okay.  He seemed okay with it.  You know, he walked through what happened.  He's the Academy Award guy.  Yeah.  He got fucked by the PC police.  Would you get that out of the hamper?  Jimmy was just asking me about Mission Impossible. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Ghost Protocol.  We're going Ghost Protocol.  You know.  Are you good?  Yeah, but I'm embarrassed to say this.  I've never seen a Mission Impossible movie before.  Oh.  And what, they're up to four?  Yeah.  How did that pass me by?  I don't know.  I've never seen that since, like, the 90s.  I think I've said it a bunch of times on the show.  I'm not an action movie guy in general.  But, of course, I should have seen a Mission Impossible movie by now.  Somewhere I should have bounced across your transom. 
[00:02:30]  And there's a lot of movies I just see for the radio show and stuff just to try to be informed.  And for some reason, I never saw a Mission Impossible movie.  And, God, I guess I missed out.  Yeah, they're all pretty good.  Yeah.  I'll give you that.  I fucking really like Ghost Protocol.  Action-packed?  Oh, absolutely, man.  Two hours, I think it was.  About two hours.  And the action barely stopped.  Oh.  And the stunts were really good.  And they weren't hokey.  I hate when stunts get so ridiculous. 
[00:03:00]  Obviously, the stunts in Mission Impossible and Ghost Protocol are borderline ridiculous.  Yeah.  But you don't feel like, okay, that's just so stupid.  And it's Mission Impossible.  Right.  It's supposed to be a little over the top.  So, you give them a little bit on that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I just hate when it's some ridiculous scenario that they end up getting out of.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But then people are going to see Ghost Protocol and go, hey, asshole, that's exactly what happened in this movie.  I guess I can't really explain it properly.  No, I'll explain it.  That it's Mission Impossible and they're supposed to have gadgetry and be like fucking, you know, pretty amazing with their stunts and shit like that. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  I was watching that goddamn movie and it got good reviews.  It's the one with fucking Denzel and the train and the Captain Kirk guy from the last Star Trek movie.  Oh, fuck.  What was the name of that?  Yeah, that one.  What was the name of it?  Oh, I'm looking.  No, not the taking a pill.  Unstoppable.  Unstoppable.  Thank you, fish man.  Okay.  Yeah, unstoppable.  And there's a scene where the train's going around a curve a little too fast. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And the fucking train comes up where it's just on the wheels on the left side of the train.  Okay.  And the right side is up off the tracks.  Okay.  And it's going around the corner.  And it's like, no, this is supposed to be a movie not based on super action hero type shit.  Right.  That can't happen.  Okay, good.  So you understand what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll give a little depending on the movie.  It's Mission Impossible.  They got wacky masks they pull off. 
[00:04:30]  They got gadgetry and fucking cool shit.  Right, right.  It's supposed to be that.  Okay.  But that's just two guys trying to stop a fucking train.  And it's up on, you know, one side of the wheels.  Know what?  And not derailing.  I think I could explain it this way.  When you're in a movie and the stunts are just over the top and crazy, if the audience  claps at the end of the particular scene, then you know, that's basically saying to the  filmmakers, you did a really good job with this.  Oh, yeah, nice.  But there's also action scenes where when the scene finally ends, you look around, you see 
[00:05:00]  people like, oh, Jesus, really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the difference, I guess.  I guess that's, in this movie, they were clapping a lot.  Like, holy fuck.  You sit there and a priest turns to you and goes, what a lump of shit that was.  Right, right.  How does that?  Well, because why would he do that?  Right, right.  Why would he say something?  Oh, there's...  I knew halfway through.  That's the train?  Oh, there it is.  I can't...  The fuck out.  There it is.  It's up on its left side.  You know, now I got to mention something else about this fucking movie, Unstoppable. 
[00:05:30]  It was named that because the camera that filmed it never stopped moving during the entire  fucking movie.  It was...  It got so annoying.  What do you mean it wouldn't stop moving?  Picture you're watching a movie.  Was it like Cloverfield shit?  Worse.  Nah.  Like, in a different way.  Not just shaky cam.  Okay.  They did shit with this where you're watching a movie, right?  And someone's in frame.  Right.  And then they're doing something, and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it's zoomed 
[00:06:00]  in.  Not it zooms in.  Right.  It goes from that to, bam, it's zoomed in.  Now it's zoomed out.  Okay.  And the camera is going around people too many times.  Right.  Like, every time Denzel's on the train, and they have the camera going around him, and  I was...  All those swooping shots?  Swooping around shots.  I'm not a big fan of the over-the-top swooping shots.  And frame jump.  It was like frame chatter, frame jump.  Like, it would jump forward, jump back.  That's everybody trying to show how good they are. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, it was hard to watch.  Distracting.  That's a cinematographer that's really obsessed with his craft.  And trying to come up with some shit.  Look, watch just some of these fucking shots.  It's...  It's like...  Now it's just normal trailer shots.  It's just normal movie shit.  I hear ya.  I saw that they zoomed out there.  That's normal.  Like, there's all kinds of...  This is all normal, man.  When the action starts...  But this is all...  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  God damn it.  They're not showing...  They're not showing them what they did during the entire fucking movie. 
[00:07:00]  This is a good trailer.  Good movie.  It looks like a fantastic movie.  Well shot.  They fooled you on the trailer.  They fooled you.  Look, it's well shot.  All right.  I see nothing but steady...  You know, steady camera.  Because they didn't want the trailer to make people go, why the fuck are they doing this  with the camera?  There's a blonde in Ghost Protocol.  Yeah.  And I begged Roland.  I'm like, can we please have her on the show?  This chick is so goddamn sexy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But then Roland goes... 
[00:07:30]  It's funny.  But you don't know what to believe with Roland, unfortunately.  He goes...  I don't think she speaks English.  What?  I guess she's Russian.  But I think she...  Like a crazy person.  Maybe she didn't speak English in the whole movie.  Now, she had a few lines in English.  She is fucking gorgeous, man.  Can you pop her up and maybe Google image the shit out of her?  Oh, wow.  She was way better looking than the lead brought there, Jane, who was Paula Patton, who's coming  in.  And Simon Pegg was really good. 
[00:08:00]  Really good in this movie.  You know, he's the tech guy in Mission Impossible.  Yeah, yeah.  Ghost Protocol.  And, you know, he had that whole humor thing going, you know?  He's the...  He had fun.  He's the fucking laughs.  That's her?  Is it?  Uh-oh.  That's...  Really?  Oh, boy.  What'd you do there?  That's a little drop off.  You put yourself out there before you looked at the picture, didn't you?  I'll...  My reputation will be on the line on this one, no problem.  She was fucking sexy in this movie.  That's not the same girl, man.  I know it's the same girl, but... 
[00:08:30]  Wait, wait.  Go back.  Go to that picture again.  Who does that look like?  A girl version of...  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Holy shit, it does.  Another girl E-Rock.  Holy fuck, it does.  It's girl E-Rock.  And now with the blonde.  Just look at the eyes.  Look at that.  Look at the eyes.  That's E-Rock.  She's pretty, though, except for her...  She's all right.  Is there any stills from...  Ghost Protocol.  That is E-Rock's face right there.  Because she...  Scarlett Jo Nagel.  Wow, man.  She looks way better in Mission Impossible than these Google Image shots. 
[00:09:00]  They gussied her up?  I get...  That's almost...  She looks all right there.  Yeah.  She looks all right there.  She had those pillow lips that were getting a little dry.  I love when the pillow lips get a little dry.  I don't like it.  Is that her?  Huh?  I guess so.  And, you know, they're so puffy that she has a tough time keeping them moist all the time.  So they get them slightly dry.  Angelina.  Go all the way to the right.  And now down.  No, down one.  That one.  I like that.  Fucking Sam doesn't know how to pick out girl shots. 
[00:09:30]  He doesn't.  He's fucking gay.  Someone has to say it.  You don't know how to pick out girl shots.  I just picked the one where tits were showing.  Yeah, but that was...  No, stop.  Yeah, because it's not about the tits showing.  Because you never fucking developed past 13.  Sometimes a shot, it could be really sexy without the tits.  Yeah, like I wanted to see the wild, windy, blonde hair look.  All right, look.  I know, but it was...  Hold on.  You didn't know which one, man.  Out of all these pictures on the screen, which one would you pick?  All right, Opie, I'm going to pick one right now, and I'm being honest.  I'm picking one, which one I would pick. 
[00:10:00]  All right, but the problem is, I know which one you're going to pick, and there's two that  he should be picking.  Okay.  Is that fair enough?  All right.  All right, go ahead, Sam.  Which one would you pick?  This one?  No.  Nope.  I would take the one with the shirt.  That one I would have picked.  That's the one I would have picked.  All right, but see, that was your second choice.  No.  The shirt on first choice is this one.  Here's why I would have taken that one, because you could see if she has camel toes.  She's wearing spandex shorts.  I want to look at the sexy face first.  I want to get to know her.  Right, exactly.  And then you look at her cunt. 
[00:10:30]  I like the movie, but I was telling, well, I said it on Twitter, there was a picture that  came out of Tom Cruise.  I don't know how to say the name of that fucking building.  The Burge Tower, I believe.  Something like that.  The Burge Tower.  That's something.  That big building over there.  Yeah, the big tall one.  Yeah.  And the scene they show from this building is horrifying.  Yeah.  They are really fucking high, and I'm not giving it away, because I think it's in the  trailers, but they take out the window, and then Tom's got to, Tom, Tom's character has 
[00:11:00]  to do some things.  And when he's climbing on the outside of the building, I'm like, holy fuck.  What do they erase all the lines?  Yeah.  How do they do that shit?  They digitally take out the wires.  It's fucking amazing.  Damn.  It's horrifying to watch, and I'm okay with heights in general.  I'm just okay with it.  But yeah, that shot that we've all seen where he's just hanging out on the tippy top of  the building, just sitting there, I'm like, it's not in the movie.  Yeah.  And I would figure, if you shot this, why wouldn't you just have it in the movie somehow? 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Why wouldn't you have that in the movie?  They have that, that was just a publicity shot, where he sat there for like an hour.  They said he signed the top of it, too.  Like, there's only a couple guys who signed the top.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  And he's just sitting on the top of the tallest building in the world, and it looks like  there's nothing.  That's got to be swaying.  Nothing attached to him.  That's got to be swaying.  I bet he loves that shit, though, because he's like a real adventure guy.  Yeah, he probably does most of his own stunts.  Scientologist, so he thinks if he dies, he's going to go to some better place. 
[00:12:00]  But a lot of the guys that are into mountain climbing and stuff, they would fucking, they  would love to do something like that, right?  Jesus Christ.  But you would think if they shot that, they would put it in the movie somehow, and they  just did it.  Why would Jim Phelps be sitting up on top of a building like that, just taking in the view?  Yeah.  I'm just sitting.  Stop the music.  I thought, I don't know, maybe the satellite receiver was up there or something.  Oh, I would be so frightened, I would fall to my death.  Oh, that would be horrid.  Oh, forget it. 
[00:12:30]  Just terrible.  You're crazy.  I don't know.  I mean, no surprise here.  Ghost Protocol, thumbs up.  I liked it a lot.  And now I want to go back and see all the movies.  Do you see that view?  Is that him right there?  Which one?  Wow, yeah.  That's actually him?  He's barefoot, yeah.  That's not photoshopped.  Oh, is that?  You know what?  That might be this photoshopped.  That kind of looks photoshopped.  That kind of looks photoshopped.  He's just got a t-shirt on.  But that could easily be him.  No, the quality, you can see it's different.  But they would have a picture like that.  Sure, but he's leaning too much and it's just... 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, but if you've got some wires attached to the back, you'd be cool with leaning a little bit.  That's crazy.  This video of guys sitting up there with no...  No, they're not attached at all.  They're just guys sitting...  That's unbelievable.  ...on the very, very highest point you can go.  That's unbelievable.  I told you I dreamt about this.  This actually prevented me from sleeping.  Really?  When I first saw these on YouTube, the clips from outside the tower were upsetting.  When you see the building for the first time in the movie, you're like, holy fuck. 
[00:13:30]  Because there's nothing anywhere as close to that height around it.  Yeah, they just went all out on that one.  Here in New York, one used to have the Twin Towers and Empire State Building.  There's so many other kind of buildings around it.  Sure, they're not nearly as tall, but it takes away from it a little bit.  Yeah, it gives you a little build-up to the big building.  Not just in the middle of nothing.  There's a hotel in there.  Makes you want to go to Dubai.  Fuck yeah, man.  It does, right?  I want to go.  Yeah.  Me and Jonathan are going to go.  We want to go to Dussel.  There's a shot. 
[00:14:00]  When they're going to Dubai, yeah, that was just fucking horrifying.  That's in the movie.  That was fucking horrifying.  Where he's like...  That's pretty cool.  Where he's just being held on by his leg.  He's hanging upside down.  Hanging outside the window they knocked out.  I would hate that.  And that's the dude...  Who wouldn't?  That's the dude from Hurt Locker.  He was great in the movie, too.  Yeah.  I don't think we're going to get him, unfortunately.  Why?  We're going to get Simon Pegg.  We're going to get the lead actress.  I just said her name.  I forgot it earlier. 
[00:14:30]  Same day?  I think so.  And then we're going to get the guy that was in Slumdog Millionaire.  He's in this movie.  Which guy?  Millionaire.  He was the game show host in Slumdog Millionaire.  Oh, yeah.  He was good.  He's like a playboy in this movie.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  He was pretty good in the movie, too.  I mean, he had a much smaller role than the other two, but...  How come we're not getting Jeremy Renner?  I don't know.  According to Roland, some kind of scheduling conflict with Regis or whatever the fuck they  call that show.  I know.  He went back to...  He took the plane into the red eye. 
[00:15:00]  If you listen to Roland, here's his information that not even a manager would have yet.  There was a water rain break on the plane five minutes ago.  How did you know that?  He couldn't know.  He had to turn around in mid-flight.  He gets mad, but I think it is part of his job to kind of be a schmoozer.  Yeah.  He really knows how to schmooze.  A schmoozer.  And I think you have to do that in his line of work.  Because I don't know what to believe sometimes.  And I've told Roland, like, you've got to keep it honest with us.  You know, you've got to tell us the truth.  Well, I tell you. 
[00:15:30]  Thank you.  And maybe he is.  I don't know.  He smooths all corners.  He likes it all the way smooth.  Smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he has an answer for everything.  That's why he's really good at his job.  How come we said that we were going to get this Adam Sandler, but we didn't?  So no, because his plane was supposed to be a 4 o'clock departure.  And it was like something to 7.30.  That was six months ago.  How do you remember that?  Do we really need Adam Sandler on our show?  It would have been fun to talk to him.  He's a bore.  Still.  I've never seen him in an interview.  It's good to be here.  I've never seen him in an interview where he was interesting. 
[00:16:00]  Good to be here, fellas.  I'm going to sing a song.  I'm going to sing a song for...  Shut up.  Did we do that same time?  Yeah, probably.  But there's a shot.  The car's in the desert as they're making their way to the big building there in Dubai.  Yeah.  And it's all just desert.  And then you see the city.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  In the middle of nowhere.  You know when you're driving in from Long Island and you kind of, you know, all of a sudden  you see that just New York City just popping up?  Yeah.  And it's like, holy fuck, that is pretty amazing if you just, you know, sit back for a second 
[00:16:30]  and really look at it.  Yeah, you kind of take it for granted now.  Just erase everything in the way and make it a desert.  Like a desert and then all of a sudden you come over a hill.  All of a sudden it's just this massive fucking city in the middle of a desert.  That's what, it looks like, you know, the shot they filmed anyway, that's what they make  Dubai look like.  Dubai.  That scene was ridiculous.  How the fuck was he on the outside of that building filming?  That's scary.  Huh?  That's scary.  Yeah.  It looks cool though.  I'll see it at some juncture. 
[00:17:00]  Well, yeah.  You said the IMAX though wasn't...  I like IMAX 3D because when you put the glasses on it doesn't matter where you sit.  Yeah.  And it's just right there in front of you.  You know what I'm trying to say?  When it's just a regular movie on IMAX, the screen is like, I'm just moving left to right.  And we have pretty good seats.  You gotta move your head too much.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe you're supposed to sit way back.  That's probably it.  I'm sure the geeks know exactly where to sit in an IMAX theater. 
[00:17:30]  We were right in the middle.  It seemed like it was like prime seating.  Yeah.  But there was so much on the side still that I had to move around to check out everything.  And I don't know if that's good.  No.  People have said to me, it's like, why are you playing Call of Duty on TV?  Why don't you play it down in your theater?  That would be so cool.  It would be big.  It's like, how am I going to play a game where I'm getting hit when I just have to move my  eyes around the screen?  Right.  You literally have to move your entire head around to scope the area out. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, it just doesn't work as well.  I mean, it's really cool, but then after a while, you're like, oh, God, you know, I just want  to kind of watch this thing without having to move my head as much as I am.  Get a head around.  I don't know.  Maybe that's being picky.  Yeah.  Arga.  I see those guys.  Those are the guys sitting up there on top of the tower.  Is that the actual tower?  Oh, yeah.  They're on top of the...  Look at that.  No.  Holy fuck.  Why don't you climb up there on a peg?  This is what we're sitting on.  Just little perches on top of the tallest building in the freaking world. 
[00:18:30]  It's windy.  My heart is pounding like crazy.  I got my strip.  I am holding onto this post like no other.  Those little buildings that you see way down there are big buildings.  It's like if you sat on one of those, you'd be high.  How do they get to that perch?  Do they have to climb on the outside after a while?  No, no, no.  Inside.  Oh, that's easy.  No, I'm not even joking.  So you got to get out and sit your ass down.  Oh, I'd be fucking out of my mind, freaked out.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  Is that water down there?  You could dive into it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  I did that.  I sure you did, Jim.  Crazy stuff, guys.  Take a gamble.  This is called sitting on the world's tallest building if you want to look it up for yourself  on YouTube.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  What's that?  Look at that view, man.  It's like so...  You ever go to the CN Tower in Toronto?  Toronto, I think that's the tallest in North America or something like that?  Yeah.  That shit is fucking cool, man.  Highly recommend you do that.  I thought of it, but it just scared me.  Why? 
[00:19:30]  You were close and you didn't do it?  No, no, no.  Just definitely.  Oh, yeah.  This fucking video.  This is Scared of Heights.  Don't watch this.  That's what this video is called.  It's a broad, really sexy broad.  And she scoots her way out onto the...  On an I-beam.  On an I-beam.  Way the fuck up on some structure.  With nothing attached to her.  These Russians are crazy.  And then this kid...  Doesn't he walk out?  And they're not attached at all. 
[00:20:00]  No, they're just...  How high up would you say they are?  Higher than you'd ever want to be.  Yeah.  That's a great way to put it.  It's fucking crazy high up.  I'm like 20 feet in the air.  I would say...  I would guess...  200 feet.  I would guess at least 300 feet to 400 feet.  Yeah.  And the guy is just standing at the end of an I-beam.  Looking out.  Would you do that?  No.  I'm so freaked out right now. 
[00:20:30]  That's the guy there.  It looks like soft trees down there.  So he'd probably be okay.  You think?  I wouldn't even scoot out onto that thing.  I wouldn't either.  I wouldn't climb up it.  And he just stood straight up.  I wouldn't go to that godforsaken country.  What's the top left, Sam?  The red guy in the right.  My favorite one is the guy that is changing the light bulbs or whatever the fuck he's  doing where he just climbs forever.  That's the scariest one.  I think that's the scariest one too.  It's a helmet camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's a game.  Did you see the one... 
[00:21:00]  Oh, fudge.  For some reason, they keep taking that video down.  I don't know why.  Because it's a professional video and the people that put it up are pissed off because  it's going viral.  It's like, of course it should go viral.  I don't know.  It's been taken offline a bunch of times.  This guy's...  What is this now?  Tightrope walking over Yosemite Falls.  No.  Well, that's a...  You know, those guys are professionals.  Yeah.  Those are professionals, man.  That's Philippe Petit shit.  The worst thing is seeing him lay down on that tower. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, by far.  Between the Twin Towers.  You see that photo?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I am so bummed out that they didn't have a really good video when Philippe Petit was  doing his shit.  Terrible.  I know.  I do not have a good video of that.  That documentary is worth watching.  I'm telling you.  Because what went into doing that, they had to shoot arrows across from one tower to the  other, secure lines overnight, and then he fucking just tightropes in between the  Twin Towers, and they don't have good footage.  They only have a still shot of him laying on the wire, and they have some video from the 
[00:22:00]  street where you can see just this speck, but it doesn't really give you a feeling  for how crazy it was.  They have a lot of good photos of him just stepping out onto the fucking...  Oh, my God, man.  It gives me the fucking willies.  He wasn't attached to shit.  That's the scariest one, man.  Fuck that.  And then he laid on his back, and he was talking about a bird that he could see right above  him.  Oh, yeah.  And he's just looking at the sky.  I'm getting all fucked up, just you talking about it.  I'm getting all fucked up.  I just got the chills. 
[00:22:30]  Can you imagine laying there, and then all of a sudden, instead of being him, you're  Opie again, and you're like, I don't know how to do this.  I don't know how to do this.  I'm not that guy.  He got me out here.  That would suck.  I would just hold the wire as tight as I could, face down, and just fucking pray that  someone's going to...  Help me!  Rescue me.  Have you ever seen footage of the guy doing the pull-ups?  Oh, from the fucking I-beam?  Yeah.  That could be my second worst one.  Look up the pull-ups.  That is a bad one, yeah.  Higher pull-ups.  That's the second worst one, I think.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  I used to watch all these.  I haven't watched them in a while.  No, pull-ups off a building or something.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sam goes to a gym.  Oh, God.  Sam, pull-ups in a gym?  Don't you look at the thumbnail?  Right there with the orange.  Yeah, there you go.  Just look at the thumbnail, Sam.  Look at this.  This is a crane.  Well, mother wouldn't get it.  It's same pull-ups on a French crane if you're following along at home.  Is this the one, Jimmy?  They had to make it into a music video.  You don't have to spice up your shit sometimes.  They're way up, too. 
[00:23:30]  How high up would you say?  That's at least...  50 stories?  Yeah, that's about 500 feet.  They're looking down at huge buildings.  At really huge buildings.  They are fucking high up, man.  This dumb French-y music.  No, it's just stupid.  It's terrible.  Fucking French.  And then the guy decides to make that shitty video.  You guys had a great thing you did, and you have to make it into a shitty video. 
[00:24:00]  Because they're French.  It's already a minute in, and nothing's happening, and you're listening to a song you don't give a fuck about.  Here he is, finally.  He's not fired in?  No, not at all.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait.  Is he wearing a parachute?  I don't know.  There's something on his back.  I know.  Just in case, maybe?  He's doing pull-ups now.  And, of course, everyone knows.  Wow, that's a lot of crazy.  You've got to figure out how many you can do, because if you can't come back up, now you're fucked.  Look at how high he is. 
[00:24:30]  Really high.  This guy's doing it, too.  Yeah, they're both doing it.  He's doing the pull-ups where he's...  Imagine your hands start sweating, and you just...  Imagine.  They are now watching.  You feel that slipping going on?  My thing is, even if it is a parachute, where's the ripcord?  It's not in front of them.  Yeah, you could just fucking...  Oh, this guy could barely do pull-ups, too.  He only did two, and he's now just hanging around.  Just let go.  Huh?  Just let go.  That's fucking scary, man.  That's a terrible song. 
[00:25:00]  Horrible.  Bloody, bloody, bloody.  I would like him to superimpose my picture there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is what it would look like if I was doing this.  Just all kinds of heroic stuff.  You're doing it.  All photoshopped in.  That guy doesn't have anything on his back, so...  Right.  Yeah, he just did that.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  Why would you go out to the middle of a crane?  I would never go there.  I would just stay down on the bottom.  I don't want to do this.  This guy's saying you can walk around the CN Tower in Toronto. 
[00:25:30]  The bottom?  I saw this video.  On the outside?  Yeah, they attach you, and you can now walk around.  On the outside.  No.  Yep.  This guy's right.  Greg...  Oh, Edge Walk, it's called.  It's called...  Yeah, okay.  They just opened this up.  I bet you this would be good to compete with the Vegas thing.  They just opened this up.  A trick plane just went by.  Look how fucking high the CN Tower in Toronto is.  That's the train for us.  That's the stadium below.  You see that little dot?  Wow.  356 meters up in the sky.  Meters. 
[00:26:00]  Stop.  1,168 feet above the ground.  Would you do that, Sam?  No.  I would do this.  Standing on the edge.  No, I wouldn't.  I'll be honest with you.  I would do this.  I wouldn't be happy about it, though.  You're right on the tower.  I couldn't do it.  My feet wouldn't move.  Because they got the wires.  Acclimatize to the altitude that we're walking on today.  Okay?  We're going to try a quick little...  I couldn't stand up once I got there.  Really?  No.  I wouldn't be able to.  I think the one that would really fuck me up the most would be the Grand Canyon thing.  When you're, like, walking on glass, I just...  I don't know.  Your mind gets all fucked up.  I did that at the Chicago Sears Tower. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at that stadium.  Look at how tiny the stadium is.  I know it's radio.  Sorry.  It's so fucking hot.  It's called CN Tower Edge Walk.  He's asking them to step right to the edge.  Yeah.  You just turned your back to the edge, okay?  Do you have any idea what I'm going to ask you to do next?  Oh.  Lean back.  All right.  Okay.  So, what you do is give all your weight into your harness by sitting.  You're going to hang in your harness, pretty much.  They're hanging in their harness.  Oh, I think there's a different video than the first one I saw.  Oh, my God.  Come on up.  Nice and slow.  What are you doing?  Good stuff.  He's swinging out over the edge. 
[00:27:00]  Holy shit.  He's over the edge.  His feet.  And the harness is holding him.  Right.  To hear that harness go.  His whole body, except his toes are over the side.  Ah, if he fell, that would suck.  So bad.  I don't know if I could do that.  No.  I know you got the harness and all, but your mind will fuck with you.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  You wouldn't do that, Sam?  No, and they're right next to each other.  I kick his legs out.  Oh, my God.  That would be scary. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, look.  The chick's going to do it.  And walking backwards.  She's like, I don't know.  You can actually just push yourself off the edge.  Nothing would happen.  Yeah.  I guess this is a different video.  The other one, they show him just walking around the whole thing.  Toes are propped up a bit.  Looking good.  My knees are very weak right now.  It's because I'm here.  Oh.  You're swooning for Jimmy.  He's so cute.  Would you jump off this like they do in Vegas?  I wouldn't even know.  What was that thing called again with the thing?  All right.  All right.  The fucking...  The dang.  What are you, guys? 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  I told you my ex did it, though.  That was fucking horrifying.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's the airplane.  They just got a fly.  There's an airplane flying next to them.  That looked like they could touch it.  Oh, my God.  How do they get back inside?  There's just a little door.  That's easy.  But no, but do they walk around the whole thing?  They all have to plummet to their death.  Supposedly, yeah.  The video I saw, they were testing it out.  There's planes lower than they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would never do that.  I guess their rules are different in Canada. 
[00:28:30]  Those planes are way too close to the top.  Look, see, now the girl's going to the edge.  Look.  She's leaning forward.  Yeah.  If that snaps, she falls.  She's leaning forward over the edge.  But that's not going to snap.  I know.  Trusting your life.  But your brain doesn't understand that.  Yeah, you want to trust some fucking union guy who hooked it up?  Canadian.  Unhook?  Who knows?  Sorry.  What's he doing?  He's fiddling with the latch.  Stop fiddling with that latch.  He's fiddling with it.  No, see, that's the second line, though, to make it completely safe. 
[00:29:00]  That's all they're doing.  That's not fiddling with it.  It's completely safe staying home.  Right.  I'm cutting the malarkey.  How about the whole steel structure just comes off?  Everything.  And now you're falling, all of you together, with the iron.  Can you imagine falling on the outside of that?  Oh, that'd suck.  Wow, that's fucked up, man.  Wow.  Look at how tight it is in the stadium.  You could jump right into that stadium.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Don't lie down there and make it like a slide in a second or something, right?  Yeah, Jim.  No, Jim.  A base hit or something.  You'd die.  Way to go, I'm pulling off all the moves. 
[00:29:30]  You've got to move a little bit and back up all your boasting, okay?  Fuck, crank tunes.  Crank tunes?  You'd have your iPod on up there?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Western Massachusetts.  Jimmy!  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I wanted to see if I did some feedback on you guys.  Did you see the six-minute prologue for the new Batman in that IMAX screening?  No.  What happened was, yeah, I went and saw Ghost Protocol, if you're just tuning in, and I 
[00:30:00]  liked it.  The new Mission Impostor.  The goals!  And a lot of people are asking because I guess they're attaching some Batman Dark Knight  Rises preview or something.  Yeah.  But I didn't get to see that.  But Roland invited me, and I thought this was just kind of stupid, and a lot of film  geeks are going to be pissed off at me, but I could have went to a six-minute showing  of the new Batman movie with the director there.  I'm like, what is that, 20 minutes? 
[00:30:30]  That's awesome.  Why would that be awesome?  Six minutes of the movie?  Imagine if it was just the first six minutes of the credits.  Right.  Six minutes of the movie, and then what's his name?  Who's doing the new?  Chris Nolan.  Yeah, Chris Nolan was going to be there, I guess.  Where was this?  And I guess most movie geeky guys would fucking come in their pants if they had that opportunity.  I'm like, I don't want to go all the way out of my way to be in a movie theater from  15, 20 minutes.  Who's the bad guy without Heath Legger?  Bane.  Huh?  Bane is the bad guy.  Who's Bane?  He's like a big, strong guy. 
[00:31:00]  He's got big muscles.  The guy from Inception, the British guy we met in the bar or whatever.  Yeah.  I think his name's Thomas Hardy.  I loved Inception.  Oh, yeah?  He's really good.  You loved Inception?  I loved it.  I still haven't seen that one.  He's great.  Oh, shit.  What is this?  It'll replace my bootleg.  Oh, thanks, man.  Cool.  That was good.  Yeah.  We just got Planet of the Apes Blu-rays.  Who's got a monkey face?  I do.  Who's got a monkey face?  Everybody's got DVDs in front of their faces. 
[00:31:30]  I'm climbing the Empire State.  This is going to be fun during commercial break.  When the mics are off, I'm going to say a few things.  Oh, look at me.  Get out of here.  Get me some bananas.  Oh, look at me.  I'm just gorilla-ing around over here or something.  Kenny, Kenny, could you get me some blueberry pie, please?  Okay.  What?  They was the ones that ate the blueberry pie!  What?  Commercial's on. 
[00:32:00]  Remember now, look.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  That's a coincidence.  Yeah, that was a coincidence, asshole.  What are you, trying to get me in trouble?  Look at you.  I said it was coincidence.  Look at me.  I'm eating some fruit and vegetables.  It's the worst improv.  Remember?  Look at me.  I'm having a cup of gorilla coffee.  We get it, Helen.  The radio can't see that I'm holding the Planet of the Apes box, which is just a gorilla  face in front of my face.  And I'm being the gorilla.  This isn't how either confident or stupid we are.  We just did an hour of radio that was completely visual.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  We don't give a shit.  Right?  Oh, look at me.  I'm somebody's uncle.  Yes, you are.  Oh, look at me.  Where's my wrench?  Where's my wrench?  I get it.  Yeah.  Quit meeing around.  Oh, you should go back to your barrel.  Don't me around.  Oh, God.  The Donkey Kong.  Where are...  Where's the princesses?  I'm Donkey Kong-ing right now.  Don't talk to me.  This way.  I got tweaked it.  Which way is that?  I can't see.  I'm a gorilla lady. 
[00:33:00]  A gorilla lady.  Oh, look.  Don't get my fingers in there.  They're going to know I'm holding this.  Oh, look.  Where's the bananas?  Oh, God.  Wait, somebody get me the bananas.  Look how stupid you look.  What's that?  I can't see anything.  I'm gorilla lady.  Oh, there he is.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, gorilla.  I'll give you...  I'm so curious right now.  Oh, my gosh.  That's exactly it.  That's good.  I'm going to tweet this. 
[00:33:30]  Now you got your visual.  That's fucking hilarious.  I guess who's in the middle.  Who's in the middle?  Oh, I am.  I am, and I've got a little blonde lady on my back.  Where's that Winona Ryder lady?  I don't know.  You who climb on my back, lady.  I'll take you to the top of the Empire State Building.  Where's that Jack Black?  He's terrific.  You like him?  I sure do. 
[00:34:00]  Fat with no charisma.  He's perfect for the movies.  I'm in the middle.  Got it.  Yes.  Yes, in the middle.  Yes, I am.  I think you've done them all.  I sure have.  I think you've done them all.  I sure have.  Oh, quick.  Somebody make some cookies out of me.  What type of business is this?  Oh, this is monkey business.  Oh, I get it.  That's right.  Quick, I'm an animal cracker. 
[00:34:30]  Get me some milk or something.  I'm Chip Monkey Lady.  I'm Chip Chipperson.  I'm Chip Chipperson.  Chip.  Chip Chipperson.  Oh, looks like I'm on top of the plane throwing it or something, sis.  Sis.  Oh, no.  King Kong.  I was never even the prince.  It's sis.  It's sis. 
[00:35:00]  Chimp Chipperson.  Yes, Chimp.  You have a sick fucking monkey.  I just want to talk like that for the rest of the day.  Who wouldn't?  Sounds like Helen Bergeron.  Yes.  Doing a Chip impression as a monkey.  Kitty's stupid.  We're going to talk to someone that's stupid.  It's all we do.  Kitty, what's up?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Hope you didn't throw anything on the ground and not in the garbage can. 
[00:35:30]  Because I'd hate to see Kitty litter.  Hey, what's up with that?  What is your porn?  I want Kitty's porn.  Kitty.  Kitty?  Kitty.  Hello?  Good evening.  Hi, you're on the air.  Turn down your radio.  Hi, Kitty.  How are you?  Hello, Kitty.  Kitty.  What do you have to say today?  Um, it's Katie, not Kitty.  All right, Katie.  Well, how about you figure that out a while ago? 
[00:36:00]  Now, the jokes don't make any sense.  Right.  Sure.  That's Katie litter.  She's waiting for us to say her proper name.  Obviously, it was written down.  Hello, Mademoiselle.  All right, Katie.  Why does everyone say happy birthday to Jimmy?  Because it's his birthday today.  My birthday.  It's not every day.  It is.  They don't do it every day.  Only on his birthday, which happens to be today.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  No, it can't be a birthday every day.  It's not his birthday every day. 
[00:36:30]  We all know that's impossible.  Every day.  Where's she from?  Oh, Michigan.  Okay, that's that.  That's Canada, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah, look on the map.  Are you in the D?  I'm not in Michigan.  Are you in the D?  Nothing.  Michigan's part of Canada.  No, it's six in the morning right now.  She's right.  What?  I think she's like...  Hey, what part of Michigan?  Canada?  Detroit?  Berlin Heights.  Yeah, it's like north of Detroit.  All right, north of Detroit is Canada.  Yeah.  So you're Canada, basically. 
[00:37:00]  That's crazy.  Do you hold up your hand like a mitten and then point on your hand where you're from?  That's what people from Michigan do.  Because the state looks like a hand.  It does.  A mitten.  And then they go, I'm from here.  Oh.  Oh, it's just...  Oh.  I do the same thing when I'm talking about New Jersey, but I do it with a palsy foot.  I wish I lived in Florida.  I just point to my cock.  Right.  Sure.  Yeah.  I live on the cock head.  It's flat with a lot of old people on it.  And my balls with a panhandle. 
[00:37:30]  The oniony panhandle.  I hate to live in the oniony part of Florida.  Yeah, of course.  See, that's what people do.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Who does that?  People from Michigan.  Oh, monkey lady.  That's good.  What part of the ashtray hand are you from?  I'm right.  Katie, dear, go ahead.  Talk.  I'm going to hold it up to that window and see if they think someone's coming to work.  Oh.  You're rolling. 
[00:38:00]  I didn't say anything.  I'm rolling.  Katie, we're too fast for you.  We're going to have to let you go.  Yeah, we're too sharp.  Wow.  We're a little too sharp for you.  We're a bunch of sharp techs.  Yeah.  All right there, Mitten State.  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful.  Why don't we break?  That's wonderful.  Because we got some Sandusky shit.  Yeah.  Oh, the food's not here yet?  I don't see it.  Well.  Not that it matters.  Oh, I got a scolding for a Sandusky joke. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, did you?  From who?  From the audience?  Fucking Phelps, ladies.  What?  Margie Phelps.  She's on your shit?  Who cares?  Ann Coulter retweeted me my Sandusky joke.  What was the Sandusky joke, first of all?  Because they said that he was supposed to face his accusers.  Right.  I said he's now refusing.  He's refusing to face his accusers.  He'd much rather stand behind them.  Oh, there you go.  Stupid ass fucking chat joke.  Yeah, that's a good ass fucking joke.  That's great.  Wordplay.  Yeah.  And Margie Phelps was like, you mock sin.  Shut up, you cunt.  You mock sin? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Oh, and some of the chip tweets were great.  That's why his feet is warm, because he's mocking sins.  That's a good one.  The chip tweets were fucking having me rolling.  Mock sin.  Yeah, Sandusky, he's just a twat.  He's just an asshole.  The accusers were ready to face him, and then, what, at the last second, the lawyer bailed?  He'd go right to trial instead of...  Right.  I wonder why.  I'm wondering...  Because the guy's fucked.  No, no, but what...  Because a lot of lawyers are saying that's bad, but I'm wondering... 
[00:39:30]  It is bad, but it's the only choice he has.  They won't have any pre-trial things happening that the jury will be tainted by.  Right.  Like, there won't be any emotional outbursts or moments that potential jurors can read about.  I mean, why else would he...  Well, there's something that was really, believe it or not, very funny about the press conference yesterday with this Amendola.  What I was telling him before the show is, it seems just as creepy as Sandusky.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He just seems like he's a fucking creep as well.  I don't know.  You can say he's a creep.  That's a fair point.  Yeah, but this guy, there's something going on with him as well.  I know he...  Yeah, there's nothing really...  I know he knocked up somebody and...  What's a creep?  Yeah, it's an opinion.  He was with a little girl or whatever, right?  And he knocked her up and then they were married.  Yeah, something happened.  But I bet you that's just the tip of the iceberg with this guy.  Oh.  Shenanigans.  I don't know, though.  The grand jury report says Penn State wide receiver coach Mike McQuarrie witnessed Sandusky,  who faces more than 50 sex abuse counts, rape a boy in a campus locker room. 
[00:40:30]  McQuarrie, the report says, told Joe Paterno and two university officials, but failed to notify police.  If you believe that, Amendola, who's Sandusky's lawyer, he said, I suggest you dial 1-800-REALITY.  Uh-huh.  And everyone just let that, you know, fly by yesterday.  Yeah.  But I got to give credit to, who the fuck did this?  Deadspin.  Deadspin.com said, well, I'm going to call the fucking number.  Let me ring that up, you know, just to see what 1-800-REALITY would be, because he's encouraging everyone to call that. 
[00:41:00]  Right, maybe he's plugging something.  If you believe McQuarrie's, you know, the McQuarrie angle.  Yeah.  Well, we called it this morning.  I would love to hear it.  And this is really 1-800-REALITY.  This is really it.  If you dial it, you're going to get this.  Ooh, good production.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, welcome to the hottest place for triple-X action.

I'll show you reality.  Hey, you want reality? 
[00:42:00]  You want reality?  Bloss is a cum walker.  Obviously, the lawyer had no idea, but oops.  Oops.  Yeah.  That's what you get if you call 1-800-REALITY, the phone number that he referenced during the press conference yesterday.  What a coincidence.  How great.  You can't just blurt out phone numbers like that.  It's probably going to be taken by something.  Yeah.  9 out of 10, it's going to be something brutal, right?  Reality.  Why reality?  Why did they get that?  Well, I guess that is a dose of reality.  It sure is.  That's a waker-upper. 
[00:42:30]  If you're looking for some sweaty man cock, reality is here you go, fella.  God damn it.  What?  What?  Wow, really?  Youth football coaches resign after they allow...  I fucking hate this.  Oh.  Youth football coaches resign after they allow a team to burn their third place trophies.  Oh.  So, there's a team. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  They come in third place.  Sucks.  And obviously, they're like, fuck this.  We're not happy with third place.  Yeah.  And I guess the team, because it says allow, which means it seems like the players came up  with this idea.  Yeah.  And they wanted to burn their third place trophies, because fuck that.  Who wants a third place trophy?  Is that why?  I don't even want a runner-up trophy.  I used to hate that when I was growing up, too.  And I guess the youth football coaches had to resign over this, because...  Do they have to, or do they want to resign?  And that was like the last...  Let's find out. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, I bet they had to.  Because they show this commercial on TV before we get on the air about...  Oh, that's stupid.  Oh, I love a trophy for everybody.  It's the one with the basketball player, where there's this, you know, this play goes down  in the team's favor, and then the goody two-shoes goes, Coach, I touched it.  Coach, I touched it.  I touched the ball before it went out.  I touched it.  He's like, oh...  Anyone that has ever played sports, you just know that's part of the game, that the refs  are going to fuck up some calls, and in the end, it kind of is a wash. 
[00:44:00]  You're going to get fucked on a bad call.  You're going to...  You know, it's going to be in your favor every once in a while.  But this commercial they're trying to shove down your throat, like, you know, sportsmanship,  and then what does it say?  For a better living or something?  Grassholes.  For a better life, or...  It's some kind of...  Some time...  Some...  Excuse me.  Type of group.  What are they trying to push?  Uh, honesty.  That we ought to be a little more honest than we are, I guess.  And it's better.  Can you find that online?  There's another one.  It drives me nuts.  What's the purpose?  What are they trying to do?  I don't understand what they're trying to sell.  They're trying to just... 
[00:44:30]  It's like a public service thing.  For what?  Uh, for being honest.  If you make a mistake, and it's overlooked, uh, and somebody is going to, um...  Why sports though?  Have repercussions for that, then...  Because it's not sporting to...  But it is.  ...win or get an advantage because of a lie.  We've all been in a situation, if you've played sports, where you're like, holy fuck,  I just got away with that?  Is that...  Do you think there's too much of that stress with sports?  Uh...  I think so.  I don't know.  The ball. 
[00:45:00]  It's not how high you can fly.  It's not how fast you can run.  Or how many touchdowns you can score that matters.  It's really how you play the game that counts.  Because the game only lasts four quarters.  For a few years.  For that moment in time.  The raping lasts forever.  Just sportsmanship.  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  No, it's sportsmanship.  What's that?  See, there's nothing wrong with that commercial.  Sportsmanship, yeah.  You should teach that.  Yeah.  No problem.  But teaching that everyone wins and everyone gets a trophy.  I hate all that shit. 
[00:45:30]  But it's symbolic of a lot.  Because that's not how real life is.  But a lot of problems are happening because of that mentality.  Yeah, because of that mentality.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're trying to jump it out the window at NYU because they don't know how to lose.  They don't know how to not be rewarded or to be told that you did right or good.  They haven't learned those.  There's weird lessons you learn when you lose, if you lose gracefully or if you win gracefully.  There's weird things you learn that develop you as a person.  The whole Occupy thing is based on that mentality, I think. 
[00:46:00]  Occupy, right?  My first love growing up was basketball.  And when we lost, I was fucking depressed.  And my dad would sit me down and talk to me.  And then if it was something I did in the game, then I would go and practice that skill  to hopefully be better next time.  You know what I mean?  It was a whole thing.  Oh, you're a bully gym.  Huh?  Remember that in the Gray Santini?  Oh, yeah.  Squirt a little.  And that seems like the way to go about it, no?  Yeah.  And I always saw the kids that had no business playing basketball. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  So then it weeds out the people that maybe they should go try something else.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  What is wrong with that?  But if you have a sport and everyone wins, what does that accomplish?  Nothing.  It's nonsense because they don't do the same thing in other competitive things like computers.  They don't like, you're not going to get a computer job equally with other people who  are much better than you.  But they expect that now.  Right.  Yes.  And that's the whole thing I'm saying with Occupy is like, they expect people that have 
[00:47:00]  done well to, that they owe them something because of their upbringing.  Because everybody, it's like, we all got a trophy.  We all won.  There wasn't any real winner or loser.  We're all in this together.  Right.  So if you win, why don't I get a trophy too?  So if you get a fucking nice car, why don't I have a nice car or a house or a fucking,  yeah.  The problem wasn't winning or losing.  It was like these shitty parents that didn't know how to tell their kids, hey, you fucking  act better when you win, hey, losing is okay and this is why. 
[00:47:30]  It's all these shitty parents that would fight at the soccer games and have these competitive,  cock-sucking parents that didn't know how to teach their kids.  So instead they're like, oh, I can't handle losing, so give my kid a trophy.  There's no more losing.  We have to decide that.  I want to tell the story again quickly.  My nephew, Carson, he loves his football.  He's been playing football since he was four or five.  Ridiculous.  And a couple years back, I went to a game and his team, he was finally on a good team. 
[00:48:00]  I've seen him play where he was on a shitty team where they were like three and eight for  the year or whatever, four and, well, you know what I'm getting at.  But this particular team, they were really good.  They've only lost one or two games, right?  And I go to a game.  I get to go to one or two a year.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, why are they sitting everybody?  And my brother, Scott, goes, oh, you see, if they're up by 20 points, you got to sit  the offense.  The starters.  Right.  To give the other team a chance to come back a little bit. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, what does that teach?  Because then what you're going to do is purposely let the team score so you can get your guys  back in.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Why would you do that?  That's not the game.  Instead of doing some, you know, parenting, which isn't easy.  I'm learning that.  Parenting is not easy.  That's exactly it.  It's not easy.  You're going to have to sit down your kid and go, look, man, you know, maybe football's  not for you or, you know, it wasn't your day, but you'll have another day and hopefully  you'll do better next time.  It happens. 
[00:49:00]  They sit the offense if they're up by too much.  What the fuck is that about?  How about you just got the shit kicked out of you as a, uh, as a team and a much better  team beat the shit out of you and it is what it is.  Right.  Deal with it.  And that happens and it's going to happen throughout life.  And that's, that's what's scary.  It's going to happen in real life.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  Not everyone's going to get the promotion.  No.  But it makes you work fucking harder and try to figure out what you're good at.  But to hear them sit and whine now about, you know, hey, he's got this.  Why don't I have it?  Right.  Well, he worked hard.  He's better at it. 
[00:49:30]  He's this, he's that.  There's plenty of reasons, but, uh, I don't, you know, I don't, I don't understand why the  parents out there allow it.  I guess they have no choice because every one of their kids is special.  Every one of them is so special.  Let me tell you something.  Some of your kids are stupid.  Some of your kids are just stupid.  They're not as smart as other kids.  They're not as talented in sports.  They're not as, you know, you got to find your niche.  Here's the story.  Coaches resigned after allowing youth football team to burn trophies.  Three New Canaan youth football coaches, including the league president, have resigned after 
[00:50:00]  concern from parents and league officials about an end of season party last month that  ended in the players burning their third place trophies.  Uh, all right.  So the coaches took many of the players from the eighth grade black team.  What?  That sounds, oh, probably.  I don't know if that means just that's, I don't know if they were actually black kids  or if they just, I don't think so.  Not in New Canaan.  Uh, team to Erwin Park for the trophy burning exercise using added. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, this is great.  Burning exercise using it as a motivational to a tool to improve next season.  There you go.  The team had reportedly won five consecutive league championships.  So they were, they took pride in winning championships.  They come in third place.  And now they're like, look, we're going to do this thing.  We're going to burn our third place trophy.  I see nothing wrong with it.  No, this is a perfect time.  But then you got the stupid fucking parents.  Uh, New Canaan police received an anonymous letter.  It's always an anonymous letter.  Why don't you show your fucking face?  This goes with what Jimmy says with the dumb haters that don't want to show their fucking face. 
[00:51:00]  Uh, anonymous.  Doesn't that make you happy?  An anonymous letter from a parent who was concerned about the incident.  Uh, on November 30th, police observed a very small burn spot in the area of Erwin Park where the incident took place.  Police have indicated that no charges are pending, but that the league itself is conducting its own investigation.  I have to know what the concern was.  In a recent email sent to parents, the league's board addressed a concern for the trophy burning incident.  The parents uniformly were disappointed and upset at this exercise and thought it demonstrated poor sportsmanship. 
[00:51:30]  I'd be all about this and I would like the match.  It's fine sportsmanship.  It's like fucking...  And an inconsistent message after the players had all been congratulated for their hard work in play.  Yeah, you congratulate them on a good season, but go, look, we can be better next year.  Again, it's like, you did great, just as good as everyone else.  No, you didn't.  Uh, the letter stated, according to the Connecticut Post, likewise, carrying out this activity in a town park showed a lack of judgment when the town specifically rules out even small fires. 
[00:52:00]  Alright, so there's a problem with the small fire in a park.  Oh, woo, look out.  Could go after that a little bit, I guess.  The coaches involved have resigned, and they were probably really good coaches.  That's the problem.  So now you're going to get one of these doofuses in there that doesn't even understand football.  Oh, see if they've got a guy in there that molests the children.  Right, exactly.  But we'll placate to the wimpy parents out there.  They've accepted their resignations, that's sickening.  And the coaches have been suspended from any further involvement with the program or any individual team. 
[00:52:30]  It's just bullshit.  It's disgusting.  I feel like the dog with the fucking kibble on his nose.  Yeah.  Stay.  Yep.  Stay.  Oh, you see this?  The players could have cared less, the officials said.  They were over it by the time the party ended.  Yeah.  So it was a thing they did.  So much.  And they probably really enjoyed it.  No big deal.  In football, there's a tradition of burning the show as a means of forgetting any disappointment in the season. 
[00:53:00]  I didn't know this went on.  And instead focusing on the positive and looking forward to next season, the coaches wrote in an email to the league's parents.  Unfortunately, we as coaches made a mistake in our attempt to carry out this tradition.  While our message was intended to be positive, and it still is a positive message, by the way, it was a mistake to carry it out in this way.  And for that, we would like to apologize.  This lack of judgment on our part should in no way tarnish all of the hard work, sportsmanship, and success that you accomplished this season and in a previous season. 
[00:53:30]  So that's an email they sent out to try to save their ass.  They don't believe that.  But why not write there and say, hey, you know what?  They said they were sorry.  Right.  Cool.  They've had a great track record here.  Yeah, let's move on.  God.  Fuck it.  There's no, there is no saying, hey, sorry about that.  I fucked up.  And like you said, let's move on.  Let's just get on with it.  It doesn't happen.  You have to step down.  You have to resign.  That's why people are going to lie about stuff.  Yeah, why would you ever apologize?  Why would you ever apologize?  An apology when we were growing up was pretty good. 
[00:54:00]  An apology got you out of some shit and you were able to continue on with whatever it  was in general.  Because they want to break you down before they fucking kick your ass out the door is  what it is.  Don't apologize for anything out there for the people that are going to get in trouble  because it's not good enough for these people anymore.  It's not going to save your ass.  No.  And you don't mean it.  That's just the start.  You're supposed to lose your job and apologize.  Yeah.  Great.  Fuck you.  Especially the people that sincerely apologize for something.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  That was really sincere.  I appreciate that.  But now we need your fucking, you know, your key. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You're done here.  Bye-bye.  Fucking assholes.  Just a bunch of parents who don't know how to fucking accept second place.  It's a stupid world we're in right now.  It's ridiculous.  It is.  And it's horrifying being a father in this world.  But they're hiding their motive.  They're really making it like it's about their kids when it really is about their lack of ability to convey to their kids that coming in second is acceptable and okay.  That's what it's about.  But they make it like, well, no, the kids, the bullying, the kids. 
[00:55:00]  Fuck you.  You're just not.  Make a decision.  If you want to have kids, don't both have careers.  Like, you have to make that fucking choice.  If you try to build a utopian childhood, you're really going to disappoint these fuckers when they have to go out into the working world where it's just a fucking massacre most of the time.  So, you know, no bullying in schools, none of this, zero tolerance policies, anything about comedy and joking inappropriately, political correctness, this, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[00:55:30]  It all just fucks them when they get out of this fake world of school and living with your parents and get thrust into the real world and realize, oh, shit, hey, wait a minute, but you're bullying me.  No, I'm your boss, shithead.  Now get the fuck to work.  Hey, you can't talk to me like that.  Oh, yeah, I can.  And get the fuck out. 
[00:56:00]  Now you're fired.  They're doing exactly what religion did, just not with the same vengeance.  But it's the same, they want mindless assimilation, just mindlessly heeding what they say.  It's fucking silly.  And what needs to be said, which is really important, it's the minority that's doing all this.  Oh, Opie, the race has nothing to do with it.  Yeah, that's just rude.  Oh, oh.  It's the minority of parents.  But for some reason, the majority of parents don't know how to get around this shit.  Because, I mean, I do talk to enough people, and like at Carson's football game, the story 
[00:56:30]  I told, you could see the frustration on all the parents' faces.  Like, this is bullshit.  We don't want this, but this is what the league has decided.  Well, they need to be more vocal.  Yeah.  They're not vocal.  I didn't see one parent that day that was like, yeah, this is proper, and this is what  should be done.  I'm glad they're doing this.  No, I didn't see that, in all fairness.  I'm glad they're turning my kid into a pussy.  They listen to the complaining parents.  So why do we allow this in our society, especially in America, where it was all about majority  rules? 
[00:57:00]  Because we don't push back.  That's all it is.  Why are we pushing back?  Because we're lazy.  And across the board, we don't push back.  What happens is when you hate something, it evokes a stronger reaction.  So you want to go do something and get it done.  Right.  When people just like something, eh, it's great.  It's called apathy.  Yeah, apathy is right.  You just go like, eh, whatever, I'm going to work.  Too many times to count, but we've got kicked off the radio and gotten in major problems  because of people that don't even listen to the show.  And then the stupid fucking company listens to this dumb little minority with a letterhead 
[00:57:30]  and knocks these really popular shows off the air.  When if you really polled the people that actually listened to the product, they wouldn't  give a fuck.  Maybe a tiny percentage, but there would be a massive majority that are like, all right,  maybe they fucked up this time, but I'm still cool with this and really still want  to be, you know, listen to Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton or everyone else that's got  kicked off the fucking air.  Something needs to happen where that trend gets broken of little groups of people because 
[00:58:00]  an organization, a group that's willing to organize and send emails, they're the only  voice being heard.  So General Mills hears 10 complaints and they don't hear a fucking 5,000, hey, let this  go.  We're fine with it.  Right.  10 complaints is all they hear.  They're a bunch of dummies in a product that, well, we don't want our product defected.  Yeah.  Pull the fucking advertising.  They should base it against everybody that uses their product that didn't write in and  say, okay, we got 10 of these and we got 10 million of these.  And unfortunately, I guess as humans, you know, if you like something, you're not telling 
[00:58:30]  the company in general, you know what I mean?  Absolutely.  But if you don't like it, you can't wait to get on your computer or, you know, write  an actual physical letter and get it in the mail.  Did you ever call customer service and say your product is working well?  No, of course not.  Me neither.  Thank you, sir.  But why are the people in charge don't understand that mentality?  That there's a shitload of silent people out there that really enjoy it.  Because they want it to go back to the way it was the day before.  Quiet.  That's all it is.  They don't want to.  They don't.  They're not performers.  They don't know how to deal with the noise or the fucking headache or the conflict. 
[00:59:00]  They're like, hey, stop.  This is what we're doing.  Go back.  Okay.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Go back.  Go back.  They just wanted quiet again.  Fire him.  I'll never forget.  In our dumb world, you know, me and Ant, because it was before Jimmy, we were in Boston  and we were trying to make a name for ourselves.  No one really knew Opie and Anthony at this point, but we were, you know, we were picking  away.  And one day we got on Howard Stern's radar.  We're just a small show in Worcester, Massachusetts, broadcasting to Boston.  And all of a sudden Howard is talking about us because of some shit that went down, 
[00:59:30]  right?  He thought we were ripping them off when, you know, to this day, I swear it was just  a coincidence.  It's the first of many.  Yeah.  But he, you know, he pointed his finger at us and said we were ripping them off, right?  And I'm like, as a radio guy, I'm thinking to myself, holy shit, this could only be good  for us.  Like a guy that has a much bigger fucking audience is talking about Opie and Anthony  when the market still doesn't give a flying fuck about us, right?  So I'm excited, Ant's excited. 
[01:00:00]  We're talking about like, holy shit, this is good for our career.  You know, Howard in New York is talking about us.  Dave Douglas, our fucking PD at the time.  I'll never forget it.  He, he, I think, I think he actually asked me to lunch and, uh, and we're at a dumb buffet.  It was always that stupid Chinese buffet place.  And I'm like, he's going to talk about this.  This is good.  We're going to try to figure out a strategy.  How do we fucking capitalize on this?  He goes, you know, Howard, uh, talked about you this morning.  I'm like, yeah, man, that's pretty cool.  Right? 
[01:00:30]  He goes, oh no, that's not good at all.  That's just not good at all.  We don't need, we don't want that at all.  And I asked him why and he never gave me a, a, a reason.  I guess he was scared of success or something.  They know they're cowards and they don't know how to, they, they, they wanted to go back  to the way it was the day before they wanted to be quiet.  Well, that's why I brought up the story.  When you said that, it, it popped this memory into my stupid head.  And I remember Dave Douglas going, yeah, this isn't good for you guys with the radio station.  I'm looking at, man, how is this not good?  A guy that has a, probably 20 times the audience easily as us at the time. 
[01:01:00]  It ended up being good.  Huh?  It ended up being good.  Well, then, then what me and Ant did, because we were on our own trip, we were like, okay,  we can never fucking listen to this guy ever for real advice.  That was the day I'm like, this guy is useless as far as our careers go.  If he doesn't think this is good.  But, because anybody in radio that, that mattered, understood, holy shit, if I, a show that is  more popular than he was talking about you, that is good for you in the end. 
[01:01:30]  They're just frightened people, man.  Frightened people get in their own way.  Yeah.  Chris Rock had a, and Patrice was not a frightened guy.  He got in his own way for other reasons.  And Chris had a good thing.  He's making me think of that a lot.  People get in their own way.  Like, all you got to do is just not do certain things and all this great shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And people do that for, uh, Patrice is a stubborn guy.  He might have had like a weird thing with success too, because, but like, kind of like  most of us, he had low self-esteem.  Like all comics do.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We have that fucking self-hating thing and we sabotage things because we're a little bit 
[01:02:00]  self-hating.  But success is scary.  It can be, sure.  I think it's scary.  It can be.  But after all these years, it's like, anything good, I just want it.  We're so goddamn good.  But, I mean, there was a time.  It was scary.  You're kidding me.  I'm scared of my shadow to this day.  Yeah.  What's going on with Patrice and, uh, Audible in those, uh, 16 hours, you know?  Yeah.  Because people are tweeting the shit out of me and I don't have an answer for them.  I don't have an official day.  Okay.  But it's 100% all, 16 hours going up on Audible in four parts. 
[01:02:30]  And the money goes to the family.  100% of the money goes to the family.  100%.  Yes.  It's going to be four parts.  I think it's $5 per part, so it's not a lot of money.  Well, we're trying to figure it out.  Is $5 too much?  I don't think so.  I think it's okay.  We're trying to push the, we're trying to push the number a little higher.  It probably should be three, but it's for a good cause.  I mean, you're talking about-  So we're thinking we want to go five to get even more money to the family.  Four hours of content per $5.  Yeah.  So the whole catalog will cost hardcore people $20. 
[01:03:00]  $20 for 16 hours.  But that's going to a good cause.  Yes.  100% of it is going to Patrice's family.  You're donating to charity and for four hours of material for $5, that's fucking not even  a dollar an hour.  But it's not on iTunes.  It's only, like, because Audible also shows up on iTunes.  This is not going to show up on iTunes because if it showed up on iTunes, then a little bit  would go to iTunes.  So we wanted to make sure 100% went to the family.  So it'll be up within days.  Exclusively at Audible.com.  Hey, Jimmy's playing, you're playing Queensbury? 
[01:03:30]  I forget the name of the place this Friday, Saturday, yeah.  And as I was driving in, I'm like, whatever happened to Matt from Queensbury?  Remember we used to say that?  Yeah, Matt LaFarre.  And there he is on the Instant Feedback.  I haven't seen his name in a long fucking time.  I always see him up there.  No, I know.  That's why I thought about him, too.  He's a big dude.  He's like a fucking stocky guy.  How fucked up is it that we know so many individual fans?  Yeah.  All the shows just don't know they're fucking fans like this.  Not to fucking pat myself on the back again, but sorry.  You should.  He writes, Opie, look up hurt feelings questionnaire. 
[01:04:00]  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Sam, look it up.  Look it up.  Please.  If it's worth talking about, we'll do it after the break because we got to eat, motherfucker.  Yeah, I already ate, but I want my friends to eat, too.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on, where's that part? 
[01:04:30]  Crazy kids listen to this when I was, uh, growing up. 
[01:05:00]  The Punks.  Come on, where's that part?  All right, here it is.  Give me, you do it.  What's that?  I have no fear.  Just run the race down and I.  Please, family, this weekend, Friday and Saturday, two shows a night.  Is that it?  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:05:30]  Isn't this the song we're talking about?  We let this go at some point.  Where?  I might throw it to myself for that music.  Where is it?  I don't want to shout.  But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out.  Oh, my God.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  The sex day.  Hello.  Something's going on.  And he looks a little more sexy than usual. 
[01:06:00]  Have you seen his new do yet, Jim Norton?  No.  Why are you lying at home?  Jimmy has not seen it.  You haven't seen it yet?  Jim doesn't know why he's got the hat on.  Are you lying?  I swear to you.  No.  I left yesterday afternoon.  So you really weren't checking your Twitter yesterday?  No.  He doesn't know what's going on.  I mean, I was checking, but not for that.  Are you playing this for the radio?  No.  I'm being really honest.  Ah, shit.  Well, I'll do the sexiest part today.  The Clash released London Calling 32 years ago today.  Before you do what you're going to do, I just want to ask.  You like The Clash? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  You did, right?  Yeah.  What were some of your songs you liked?  I liked this one.  Yeah, absolutely.  And then I liked the other one.  You go rock the Casbah, or is that too poppy?  Rock the Casbah.  That's The Clash?  Rock the Casbah.  That's terrible.  Rock the Casbah.  I liked that in hindsight.  I actually liked that.  I was a train and vain guy, and maybe a little lost in the supermarket.  You know what I like about The Clash?  They're not over-played.  There's so many bands that are like, all right, I heard that a thousand times. 
[01:07:00]  Like, when you hear a Clash song now, you're kind of like, oh, cool.  Yeah, they didn't fucking kill it.  I haven't heard this, like, last week already, you know?  Well, we got E-Rock in here.  Here's my picture of the hat.  Speaking of flashing.  No, you don't.  Wow.  Screw the hat.  What's wrong with your hair do?  You really don't know what's going on.  No clue.  None.  I'm trying to read you.  I'm being really honest.  I don't have...  Wow, you were busy yesterday.  I was...  I literally was...  Ah, motherfucker, no battery.  Ah, but there is this.  Motherfucker.  But there is this. 
[01:07:30]  It's from True Life.  Yeah, it was.  You got it?  I knew that one.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to work.  What's wrong with your hair do, sweetie?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Nothing's wrong with it.  Fuck this.  Right.  Stupid fucking camera.  Hold on.  Because Jimmy hasn't seen this yet.  Do you not like your hair do?  I like it.  Now, let's remember.  Let's recap.  How old are you, Yeran?  33.  He's 33.  When did you get married?  Over a year ago.  Over a year ago. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  Okay.  That sort of comes into play here.  Jimmy can't wait.  I know.  Look at him just smiling.  Jimmy is what they say, chomping at the bit, Ad.  Yes.  I've never seen Jimmy look like that before.  He's like, could you stop with a small talk?  Because I'm laughing already.  Because E-Rock, I know, kind of likes it.  It's like, you're wearing the hat because everyone gave you shit?  No, because you hadn't seen it yet.  That's why.  Oh, okay.  Always thinking of the show, that guy. 
[01:08:30]  He really is.  I do love E-Rock.  Are you ready for this, Jimmy?  Sure.  All right.  Let's unveil.  All right.  Sure.  Unveil for Jimmy.  He looks like the dude from Fight Club, right?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Meatloaf.  Oh, yesterday was hilarious.  Fat Shady.  Always in the Shady. 
[01:09:00]  Slim Shady.  Oh, there were plenty of great fucking ones coming yesterday.  M&M instead of M&M.  There you go.  Why did you do that?  E-Rock bleached his hair.  Why did you do that?  I just felt like doing it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's really white.  Speechless.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's Richie Rich kind of a thing.  Yeah.  I don't think it's that bad. 
[01:09:30]  I just don't know why he did it.  I personally think you're having one of those slow, nervous breakdowns.  What did your wife think?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, she...  I had a feeling it might be that close.  Are your eyebrows done, too?  They did them a little bit.  Who's they?  I went to her hairstylist.  To your wife's?  Yeah.  She told them that you're her husband?  Or did she say, hey, there's a guy I know who needs this done?  Yeah, man, if I were to do that at home, maybe.  I was going to, but she said, no, if you're going to do that, then do it the right way. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, okay.  Cool.  It's cool.  Yeah.  Blundy.  So what happened?  You went and got it done?  Mm-hmm.  And were you tired from chasing Tom Cruise all over with Wilford Brimley?  Rutger Hauer reference.  So, okay, what happened?  You got it done, and what did she do?  Besides, hopefully, get a lawyer.  No, she said it would take a little while to get used to, but she's fine with it. 
[01:10:30]  Well, the fact that she married a man, and she's living with the fucking bird from the  Snoopy cartoons.  It was stuck.  Yeah, people could figure out.  It was always stuck.  Terrible work.  Oh, they're calling him Clydesdale Boy instead of Pony Boy?  Stay Fat Pony Boy.  Or Stay Golden Arches.  That was another one.  There were a few good ones coming yesterday.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  No.  I've been talking about doing this for a while. 
[01:11:00]  It's really blonde.  I think it got blonder.  Is that possible?  Oh, my God.  It's funny.  Did anyone say vanilla ice cream yesterday?  Did anyone say that one?  Vanilla ice cream.  I think we did most of these, but I'm not sure if we did vanilla ice cream.  Yeah.  Of course, Danny came up with Bulk Hogan yesterday.  A lot of wrestling names.  Bulk Hogan.  A lot of wrestling names yesterday.  What was the other one?  Brutus the Barber.  Cheesecake?  Cheesecake.  Ah, yeah.  Nature Blob.  Ric Flair. 
[01:11:30]  And my favorite was the American Cheese Dusty Rhodes.  Oh, you rock.  You're like a real blondie or something.  Yeah, Chip.  Good one.  Don't get in on this chip.  So there you have it.  Yes, you do.  You, uh...  Oh, I know what I got.  You know what would look good with that hair?  What?  His brain matter.  Eric, I don't want to see your head get done. 
[01:12:00]  I love Eric.  Who did this?  Sam?  Yeah.  Sam walked around SiriusXM yesterday.  Well, Eric was, uh...  He wanted to show off his hairdo to all the ladies.  I noticed he'd be doing it.  Oh, come on.  So I made him stop so I could record the reactions.  Oh, good.  And the women had...  We got a little montage of the reactions.  Yeah, this is all the girls of SiriusXM reacting to it.  All the ladies.  Wow.  Sexies.  New hair.  All the cougars.  That's absolutely why you did it, right?  For the chicks. 
[01:12:30]  Isn't that why guys do that?  Yeah.  No.  They do it for the girls.  Why else?  Why would you do it, then?  That's a good point, Eric.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand you're married and everything like that.  I understand when you...  Some guys that are married still want to come off as attractive to the girls and  stuff.  You look like Pye Fieri.  When you get married, you want to still kind of keep yourself together, but you don't  want to dress.  It's a kind of change of look, I don't think, right?  He wants to let the ladies know that there's still some sexy... 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  There's still some smoldering in that fireplace.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Some fire in that belly.  Someone wrote Corey Ham, but wouldn't it be Corey Hamburger?  Corey Ham, Corey Ham.  That works.  Yeah, I guess.  All right, Brad.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  DC.  All right, here we go.  The ladies at SiriusXM reacting to Iraq's new do.  Julia from XMU.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  You know the sex bagel Eric Nagel, right?  How do these people know you?  I wouldn't know...  Oh, he's a social butterfly. 
[01:13:30]  He walks around just knowing people.  That's Sam's job.  You say butterfly, I say pariah.  Search for XMU.  But I wouldn't know that.  How do you know that?  Oh.  Why would you know that?  Oops.  I love the sex bagel Eric Nagel.  Well, wait till you see his new hairdo.  Show him, Iraq.  Oh, my God.  Why did you do that?  Alex, the producer extraordinaire for SiriusXM Hits 1, you know, Eric the sex bagel, right?  Of course. 
[01:14:00]  Show her your new haircut.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's biting herself.  I am speechless.  What?  What did you do?  What did you do?  In, like, a horrible way?  I don't know.  It's just so different.  Taylor from Wake Up With Taylor.  How do you know this?  I know everybody.  Who's Wake Up With Taylor?  I wouldn't know that person if she had a sign that said, I'm Taylor.  We simulcasted on her show.  We did?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Kenny and me went over there one day.  Oh, well.  Oh, right.  I've never heard of her.  What channel is she on?  She's not Cosmo.  Planet of the Apes channel.  It's Taylor.  I have not heard of Taylor.  She has a raspy voice.  She has Taylor in the morning or whatever.  That's sexy, the raspy voice, right?  No, that's sexy.  No recollection.  No.  That's sexy.  Look at that blonde hair.  Hey, what's up?  You know Iraq, right?  Sex Bagel?  What?  Who?  The Sex Bagel?  The Sex Bagel?  Yeah, Eric Nagel.  No, I didn't know you did the Sex Bagel.  Have you ever met him before?  Never.  Okay, well then tell me what you think of his look.  Take off your hat, Eric. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, wow.  You look like...  Are you gay?  Holy shit.  She can hang.  Yeah, yeah.  Taylor's all right.  Are you gay?  No.  Did you like that question?  I like it.  That's a compliment.  Yeah, it is.  I like it though.  I mean, if you're, you know, if you're going to go dance in a cage tonight, I like it.  Me from the heat, what do you think of Iraq's hair? 
[01:15:30]  It's interesting.  You don't like it.  It doesn't match his skin tone.  As a female, do you find him more or less attractive physically?  I don't want to hurt his feelings.  That's the answer.  Sam, I don't.  Are you going through...  What's that, Eric?  I'll answer it for.  Yes, that would be less.  Wow, Madison from Alt Nation.  You know Iraq the Sex Bagel, don't you?  Yeah.  He just looked at my tits.  That's funny.  Did she look at yours back then? 
[01:16:00]  No, wait.  Is Taylor hot?  She sounds cute with that raspy voice.  She's cute, yeah.  Yeah, she's got that raspy voice.  Is she pretty?  Yeah, she is pretty.  How old is she?  Let's take a look at it.  You got a picture.  What the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, I know Sam.  Did anyone have a picture up there?  Sam, what's wrong with you?  Did anyone have a picture before the bit started?  Right.  We'd have pictures of all these bruds.  How bad do you want to put fucking Iraq in that hairdo at a table with De Niro as Capone?  Not that I love you, because I do, but do you know how great that head would look when  a bat hitting it?  I thought you said she was...  Oh, she's cute, man.  The blonde? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  The other girl's kind of cute, too.  Let me see.  Let me see that bitch.  Make it bigger, Sam, before I kiss you on the mouth.  Is that a threat or a promise?  It's both.  Oh, bigger.  It's a thrummas.  Yeah.  So...  What are you doing?  You slid it all over.  No, Sam, what are you doing?  That's the worst.  It's wrecking the bit.  Let's keep talking.  I want to see what the girl looks like.  She's pretty.  She likes it where the doo-doo comes out.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  I'd like to ask her.  Her raspy voice is very nice.  It's attractive.  Some guys like that.  Your voice is kind of scratchy.  It doesn't mean that you like it where the doo-doo comes out.  Dummy used to have one of those voices.  Who's that?  Dummy Moore used to have the raspy voice.  Dummy?  Back in the day.  She's cute.  How old is she?  Yeah.  I think she's probably like 30.  Is she married?  Yeah, she might be married.  Of course.  Why wouldn't she be?  God, am I on a run at dead ends?  Holy fucking shit.  Bad run there, Jim.  I'm like a fucking mouse with Down syndrome trying to go through a maze to get some cheese. 
[01:17:30]  I just keep banging my stupid lunk head.  Lunk head.  Terrible run.  Let's get back to this.  The ladies at SiriusXM looking at E-Rock's new do.  From Alt Nation.  You know E-Rock the sex bagel, don't you?  Yeah.  He just looked at my tits.  You bet he did.  All right.  Now I'm done.  Well, you remember what he used to look like, right?  Yeah.  Take off your hat, E-Rock.  Oh.  My. 
[01:18:00]  Ah!  What the fuck, man?  Madal from Dirty Dog.  You know E-Rock, right?  Yes.  You know what he looks like, right?  Or what he looked like, I should say.  Yes.  Take off your hat.  What?  What is that?  Why did you do that?  I love the why did you do that.  You bleached it.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan.  No.  No.  Not at all.  I don't even have to squeeze that out of you.  Wow.  The ladies hate it.  They hate it.  They really are.  No. 
[01:18:30]  That means your wife hates it.  Yeah.  I'm sure she does.  She's just not saying it.  You should have went into shade.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see what they say about that.  Because like literally, they could probably read by you.  Yeah.  In there.  I showed Jess a picture of Eric last night.  While you were fucking?  No.  Oh.  Okay.  Do you want Eric to cuckold you?  No.  No.  A blonde cuckold.  Is he the blonde bull that's going to come over?  No. 
[01:19:00]  Okay.  She also absolutely hates it.  Oh, she didn't like it?  She's befuddled by why he would do something like that.  Yeah.  There's no reason.  You haven't really given a reason.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, there really is no.  You used to do highlights every once in a while, but this is.  Something came up a few months ago.  We were talking about.  I don't know if it was on this show or the after show that I used to highlight my hair.  Uh-huh.  But I haven't done that in so many years.  And it just got in my head.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to do it one more time.  And I've never done this before where the whole hair was over. 
[01:19:30]  You're having a very early midlife crisis, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you driving a Mustang to?  Hey.  At least I'm on schedule for mine.  I actually didn't even mean that.  No.  Believe me.  I've been having a midlife crisis since I turned 13.  Yeah.  I should have said that.  I'm in another sports car.  But that's not like you, Iraq.  To be so rash.  I think he's having a nervous breakdown.  I think so, too.  Nah.  It's one of those slow ones, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just creeps up on you. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  It's just something to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's something to do.  I'm very aware of nervous breakdown people.  Build a model.  Get a hobby.  Some are really quick, and others are just slow.  It's a slow few.  Like, the tide is slowly coming up.  Are you comfortable with your age?  I'm fine.  Yeah.  Because usually, you know, you hit the 30 mark, and it's like, all right, I'm 30.  But I was just 29.  I pretty much just remember 29.  30's nothing.  It's the couple of years after 30 that you start thinking, all right, look, I'm entrenched. 
[01:20:30]  I'm in my 30s.  I'm in my 30s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that could be a thing.  The marriage thing, which, you know, it doesn't matter how good it's going or anything like  that.  You understand, like, wow, you know, it sinks in that, like, ah, I'm married.  They got a house?  Got a house.  That's a big thing.  Big responsibility.  Big responsibility.  You're not young, free, whimsical Eric anymore.  So it makes you want to just shove your head in Clorox.  Instead of him having a midlife crisis, maybe he's having a mid-weight crisis.  Why am I laughing at my own shit? 
[01:21:00]  All right.  We think that, um...  Something's going on in your head.  Yeah.  The house is a big one.  That's the...  Sorry, I'm kidding.  Yeah.  Responsibility.  What's up with you today?  I have a little bit of coffee.  You all right?  I'm tired and slept.  I tried to.  I lit on a plan, but I couldn't sleep.  Are you going to have kids soon?  No, I don't know.  Are you...  Ah.  In what way?  Jimmy's...  Yeah.  We've been running into a lot of dead ends.  Yeah.  Just nothing for dead ends. 
[01:21:30]  Are the Nagels trying?  I want to know about some of the dead ends.  Are the Nagels trying?  I think once the house is all done.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  But you could say, like, then actively trying.  Are the Nagels preventing right now?  No.  All right.  Oh, you pulled the goalie.  Nice.  He pulled the goalie.  So the Nagels are kind of trying.  Consumpting.  Are you a pull-out guy or no?  No.  Oh, boy.  You like to fucking...  Oh, that Nagel seed.  Do you say that Prince Nagel's seed is running wild? 
[01:22:00]  It's too valuable to be left on a stomach or a chest or a face.  No.  No.  No.  Do you cry when your semen is wasted on a belly?  Or do you remind your wife?  Humanity cries.  Right.  How lucky she just got it.  Exactly.  When you're about to come, do you say, I'm going to come, or do you say, get ready for  your gift?  It's a gift from God.  How great would it be to say that to a girl?  Get ready for your gift.  Do you...  Are you a laughing?  There comes royalty. 
[01:22:30]  I would think some women out there, that would really turn them on if you actually said  that.  Roll out the red vulva.  Right.  Wow.  They pulled the goalie.  Are you a leg pusher backer?  When you're going to come, you push the legs back, and that way the come goes nice and  deep.  Oh, yeah?  That's what you got to do.  How do you do it with your ass?  That's a good tip.  They just have them fucking triangle themselves up on their face and heels, like a downward  dog for yoga, so it doesn't leak out of their asshole.  Troy just messaged me on Gchat. 
[01:23:00]  Of course he did.  And said, Eric used to bleach...  Gchat.  Sorry?  Yes, sir?  Eric used to bleach his hair back in the late 90s.  He's probably doing it because he was cool back in his glory days.  Oh, wow.  Glory days!  Are you thinking back in your glory days?  Yeah.  Back when you get on a skateboard and it wouldn't break in half.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  There might now.  Oh, man.  He just sits there.  What a trooper to walk around, though, and do that.  But he's fucking great. 
[01:23:30]  He just walks around.  But he did it.  He took the hat off.  He didn't give a turkey.  But he wants people to accept it.  Yeah.  It feels as if...  I thought of doing that as a goof, because my hair I could just cut off.  Yeah.  I really did think of bleaching my hair just to be silly.  Well, you did the horseshoe for the live broadcast.  Yeah, I would bleach it just to annoy my ex.  I wanted to do it when I was dating her.  Just come home with bleached hair.  What's up, bitch?  I'll fuck you.  Let's all come in after the Christmas holiday with bleached hair.  Really?  No.  Would you do that?  No, I don't think I'd look good as a blonde.  What do you think? 
[01:24:00]  You're a fucking...  A nine is a brudet.  Exactly.  Yes.  None of us are exactly fucking dishy.  Except you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  I used to, back in the...  Yeah, I would bleach it.  I'd color it sometimes, but...  What color?  Sexy.  Like, I'd mix in red or green with the blonde.  Oh.  Nice.  That's wild.  For this time of year.  I highlighted once in my life...  Oh, boy.  And I was at BAB, and I had longer hair, and I fucking highlighted it. 
[01:24:30]  Very subtle.  I went for a little...  Very subtle, like, you know, I was trying to go for that, what my hair looks like in  the summer type shit, right?  Ah.  I walked into my house, and the disappointment on my dad's face, I went, holy fuck.  Because he thought you were gay.  I'm never fucking doing this again.  Because that's like old school guys think that's gay, and they don't want their son  to be gay for the most part.  Well, I mean, you're absolutely right.  My dad was from the older generation.  He just missed the Beatles.  He was Frank Sinatra, not the Beatles, which was very important to the people our age. 
[01:25:00]  If you had the parents that were into the Beatles, they were more accepting about a  lot of shit than you did.  But he was Frank Sinatra, so he's like, that's fucked up that my son is putting a little  color in there.  That's crazy, because you couldn't even go to, like, the salon to have your hair done.  You went to the fucking barbershop.  Right.  Dad grabbed your hand and said, come on, we're going to the barbershop.  But do you agree, if your parents were more Beatles people, they would accept some of 
[01:25:30]  the shit.  I came home with an earring when it was really popular from college.  Two things.  Yeah.  Those two things bummed him the fuck out, and I had to try to explain, everyone is doing  this.  Yeah.  But he just didn't get it at all.  Because she was Beatles, right?  Yeah.  And my dad was more, you know, that generation.  So he wasn't cool to anything that was kind of new.  Sleepy?  No.  I don't like that at all.  My eyes are drying out.  Yeah, that's the first time I've never break down.  Oh, shit. 
[01:26:00]  Lack of sleep.  Why are your eyes drying out?  I don't know.  Were you up all night just walking wide-eyed, staring at a wall, thinking of murder?  He was trying to write.  He got tired.  He was writing red rum and lipstick on the wall.  What are you doing?  Travis just got a text message from somebody that called Eric.  I don't think it's appropriate, but they called Eric a bleached whale.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Because he's fat.  Fuck.  Oh.  Damn it.  That's terrible.  Damn it.  What was the craziest thing?  Captain Lou Albino is coming through. 
[01:26:30]  He wasn't even bleached.  That's funny, though.  Let me ask Jimmy and Ant, and real answers.  What was the craziest thing you did growing up with your look?  Like, I admitted to little highlights, and I did the earrings, stupid thing.  You'd do anything where your parents were like, what the fuck?  I had that ridiculous afro for my whole fucking youth.  But wasn't the big hair in at that point?  Well, up to a point.  When I was a little tater with a big fucking afro, you know, everybody thought it was kind  of cute.  Yeah.  And as I got older, it was like, what the fuck is this guy doing? 
[01:27:00]  He looks like that kid from room 222.  You're doing any of the stupid clothes?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  80s was just crazy.  Yeah, but that was the style, so I guess we all sort of got...  When I started dressing myself, I was wearing plaid with stripes, like, just without a clue.  Fucking pants that were much too short.  Right.  Like, I just didn't know.  I was an idiot.  Jimmy, what'd you do?  Any earrings?  Fat laces.  No, no, I didn't want earrings.  No tattoos.  Fat laces.  My Kango hats. 
[01:27:30]  Call them Eric Laces.  My hair.  My hair.  My hair was so fucking unmanageable that my fucking barber, who I think is gay, Andy,  who would press his big stomach against my arm and sell me sweatsuits.  At least fucking push your cock up against the arm.  He couldn't.  Oh, that's why he went with the big gut?  He was trying.  And when he would comb my hair, he would, like, it would get long and he would, he kind  of just, uh, sprayed it back.  Oh, like a pompadour?  Yeah, oh, it looks so bad. 
[01:28:00]  Like, like spraying it back?  He'd comb it back?  I always wanted to comb my hair back like the cool guys.  Yeah, yeah.  With that dumb cowl.  But, dude, I wouldn't wash my hair for three days because it was so stiff.  Yeah.  It was so bad.  That's terrible.  I couldn't do that either.  Like, like Sam can't do it.  It's just one of those, you know, you got that hair.  Yeah.  No slicking back.  No.  Oh, I remember going to the barber, though, and getting it cut pretty short.  And, uh, and then my father, like, taking the brush and, and he'd grab you by the face  like this and go, come here, come here. 
[01:28:30]  And just grab, and brush, like, real hard.  And I was like, ow, ow, ow, shut up.  Stop crying.  Dump the wine.  I'll give you something to cry about.  What an asshole.  And he's, like, brushing my hair too hard.  I don't, I don't understand how parents can be assholes.  Eh, it was the time.  That's how parents were back then.  That was a good parent back then.  You think?  Yeah.  The bad ones killed their kids.  True.  Roland is begging me to say his joke.  Oh, Roland.  He's a good one, too.  Perez Hill ton.  Ah! 
[01:29:00]  Well, see?  Because he's overweight.  Hyphenated joke is always good.  Right.  Because he's hilly or something.  No, it's the ton part.  Cigars and Scotch, King Kong, Blondie.  Oh, okay.  You're missing the point, ladies and gentlemen.  No, the King Kong is because, you know, Iraq's a bit overweight.  And then the Blondie.  I like it.  He went a different direction with the whole thing.  King Kong, Blondie, wasn't bleach blonde.  No, no.  It ties in with the wrestler, but not the hair.  Yeah, but Brutus the barber didn't have blonde hair. 
[01:29:30]  He is now, so it still counts.  You need some blonde-haired wrestlers.  Right, you need a bleach blonde.  That's why Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes.  Yeah, that was.  Paul Kogan.  Oh, right.  Dusty Rhodes.  Why don't they sleep them?  You think Eric's trying to get his wild side out before the kids come?  Of course he is.  He's trying to be a crazy guy.  I'm going to go nuts.  He'll be on the cruise ship running around.  There's the guy who was doing a conga while last night.  He's walking up to the chandelier. 
[01:30:00]  There's the wild man from Cruise Director.  Going on a cruise soon?  No.  New vacation.  We missed something here.  He said he's going to try for kids after the house, but they pulled the goalie, so he's  technically trying now.  No?  Every time.  Getting it in?  If it happens, it happens, but...  That's a good plan.  Not doing that.  Is she ovulating?  Oh.  Is she ovulating right now?  Right now, I don't know.  Do you talk dirty and better?  Are you a dirty...  No.  No.  Not really.  Are you quiet?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Do you have a tiny penis?  Oh, Jesus.  I think Eric's probably over six.  I think he's packing.  He's got a lot of balls, like literally.  He has a big bag.  You got big balls?  You got a...  Oh, yeah.  You said something like that while I was out.  I didn't hear it.  No, because when you used to strip down your boxer briefs at K-Rock to get on the stripper  pole and get on the scale...  Sam said you had big balls.  You could tell.  You had big balls.  You got big, heavy balls.  Because it's as big as Jonathan's bulge?  No, no, no.  Jonathan's bulge is much bigger than Eric's or any of ours.  Jonathan is giant across the board, I think.  He's got huge balls and a big, fucking piece. 
[01:31:00]  But like Eric, when he stripped down to his underwear, you could see his heavy balls kind  of waving back and forth.  Heavy balls.  You got big, heavy coconut balls?  Yeah.  Cum-filled gifts.  Cum-filled gifts.  Seed.  Yeah, they're like fucking...  They're like click clacks.  They're full of cum.  Like your Vaz Deverns is really thick to get all that cum shooting out.  You probably have very thick, like giant veins in your dick and balls to get all that 
[01:31:30]  cum out fast.  It's got to feed the monster blood.  It's like a tube of toothpaste.  You step on it.  Shook.  Really big balls?  I do all right.  That's what I thought.  What does that mean?  So you're quietly fucking?  I'm not really a talker, no.  I'm so vocal.  Do you talk dirty?  You talk dirty talking?  Yeah, a fucking man talks a little dirt.  But I mean, are you comfortable doing that?  Like, you like to be vocal.  Yeah.  Of course.  If it's fitting.  I love it.  You know, I'm not going to go out of character. 
[01:32:00]  What do you mean?  Yeah, motherfucker, I'm fucking you bitch.  No, I don't mean that.  Like, I want to do that or, you know, I just talk like myself.  Yeah.  A little whisper.  How about daddy stuff?  Would you do that?  No.  Nah.  That is just fucking creepy.  I disagree.  Yeah, I'm not...  What?  Nah, not daddy shit.  That's really kind of...  I love that shit.  Really?  ...creepy.  Fuck yeah, man.  In fact, that we're usually the same age.  Yeah, I don't think it's abnormal, but...  Yeah, I never...  Nah, not really.  It's not a requirement for me.  Like, I don't need to do it.  Right.  But like, if a girl likes... 
[01:32:30]  Some girls like that shit.  I guarantee a bunch of guys just went, fuck yeah, out there, but nah.  Yeah.  Not me.  Oh, no.  Yeah, be daddy special, girl.  Really?  Oh.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Jesus, what's special about that?  It's a secret, stupid.  That's incestuous, like...  Exactly.  It's fantasy shit.  Gameplay.  Yeah, of course.  Roleplay.  Hey, you want to share a little secret with your special girl?  It's weird, no?  What?  Like, it's a daughter-father thing?  No, like, it's fucking...  It's a Belushi and Ackeroid from Neighbors. 
[01:33:00]  Not at all.  We're Buzz Aldrin and fucking Neil Armstrong on the moon.  That's right.  Show NASA how you suck it.  That's fucking less offensive, that's for sure.  I want to have, like, a little secret while Michael Collins is on the other side of the moon.  Imagine if, as soon as the ship disappeared, they jerked each other off.  Like, they couldn't do it.  They ran up into the module to suck each other's... 
[01:33:30]  As soon as the ship cleared the mountain, they were sucking each other's dicks in the module.  Oh, fuck, is that a great visual.  Tranquility Base, we're going around the dark side of the moon for LOS, so I'll see you in about a half hour.  Roger that.  And Buzz was complaining because he loves his ass eating, but Neil wouldn't do it because he was sitting in a chair for three days. 
[01:34:00]  For fucking a quarter million miles.  Yeah, cutting gassers and fucking tang farts.  He didn't want to lick his ass with tang farts.  But he normally would lick his ass?  Oh, yeah, as a goof.  But, yeah, I like that dirty talk like that.  It's fucking hot, man.  But, again, it's not required. 
[01:34:30]  I don't have any that's required.  I hate when those, like, Hispanic girls are like, oh, poppy.  I don't like that either.  Poppy, it's like, really, poppy?  I don't like that either.  I don't like poppy.  No?  I like it's...  Does she call you daddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes.  You hear that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What do we got here?  Word dada is even hotter.  I'm just kidding.  I don't call for that.  Boo dada.  That's creepy.  Oh, yeah, that's creepy.  Yeah.  We should break, unfortunately. 
[01:35:00]  Wow, that's so weird.  These stupid commercial reads are killing us.  Tis the season.  I mean, we love our sponsors, don't we, guys?  But they are getting in the way.  We've got to break so we can do some live reads, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock, thanks for the hair thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Good job.  You don't say anything in bed?  I feel weird doing that.  What are you...  I don't know.  I just don't feel comfortable.  But you...  Because it sounds so phony if I do it.  You know?  Because I'm not normally like that.  So if I do it, it sounds forced and it sounds stupid.  But when you're going to come, do you say anything or no? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, I'm going to come.  Just the announcement.  Yeah.  Here you, here you, here you.  Here you, here you.  Steed.  Like the Long Island Railroad.  It's either Port Jefferson or you're going to come.  Could you, for the show, homework assignment, go, you know, here comes your gift and see  how she reacts to that?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Don't tell her, though.  She doesn't listen.  If you're getting...  And this is not even with your current wife. 
[01:36:00]  Just you as a sexual being.  When you would get blowjobs, would you, like, talk to the girl while she sucked your dick?  No.  What do you do?  What do you hum?  Stare.  Stare.  What do you look at her, stomp?  Just look at her.  You don't pull it out?  Fucking rub it on her face?  No.  Well, it's wet with her spit?  Then kiss her and then put your dick back in her mouth?  What are you doing?  What are you, fucking moping around up there?  A little moping.  You're missing a few steps. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You just sat there and blown?  Just stare at her dandruff?  Don't compliment her on her technique?  Yeah.  You grab her hair a little bit?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you do that, but I don't comment.  I don't do commentary while it's going on.  Wow, you're sucking that like a champene.  Champene.  Oh, you're...  You drag her around the room by her hair or anything?  No.  You spank?  You spank her?  Uh-oh.  I tried that.  Oh, you paused.  I tried that.  And she laughed at you.  And this is where it got awkward, because she said, don't do that, because it was just 
[01:37:00]  after you were trying to show me on the air here how to spank a girl, and I was doing  your technique.  Oh, you probably did it wrong.  And she freaked out, and she said, stop that.  I know who taught you that.  Oh, that's cool.  Anything worse when you try a move, and they're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Why are you spanking me?  What are you doing?  Oh, you want to spank the asshole itself?  That's always awkward.  But Iraq...  Oh, stop, of course.  Iraq yells, I'm going to come. 
[01:37:30]  And she yells, I can't breathe.  I think it's going to be on time.  All right, let's go.  We've got a break.  I want to talk more when we get back to Iraq about sex.  Yeah, all right.  We can do that.  Also, Hulk Hogan is suing everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The audio's great.  We've got to get to that today.  And they're trying to make it illegal to text and drive, which is a good thing.  Yeah, but they don't want you to be able to talk hands-free, either.  Yeah, I know.  There's problems with this whole thing.  We could discuss that as well.  Stay there.  Yeah, I'm going to come. 
[01:38:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because we're as cold as the Ice Road Truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  The sick, the sick, the sick fucking puppies  Fuck it up, you are true 
[01:38:30]  Sirius XM  XM  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  Oh yeah  Cell phones  How do we feel about this?  Well, buy them with something  Chip's laughing  I like imitating Chip  Drivers and cell phones don't mix 
[01:39:00]  They don't  I gotta agree with this  Cell phone drivers  And I've said it before, sometimes  In some cases worse than  People that have been drinking  Not hammered drunk driving down the street the wrong way  But if you've had a few beers  You are gonna drive better than somebody  That is on their fucking phone  Dialing, texting  Let me up what you just said  Not sometimes, always  Yeah  Because when you're driving  You know when someone is fucking around with their phones 
[01:39:30]  Oh yeah  In a lot of cases you don't see the drunk driver  No, especially the buzzed driver  The really bad one that is  You're over the limit  You're over a .08, let's say  Right  You're a .09, a 1, whatever  But you can usually make it home  If you're, you know  You're kind of good at it  But on that cell phone  I've seen people weaving  Completely out of their lanes  Almost hitting the retaining wall  The center divider  Almost hitting a car in the lane next to them  Doing anywhere between 20 and 70 miles an hour 
[01:40:00]  And then right when you go to pass them  You gotta look and see what the fuck is wrong with the guy  And there it is  Fucking cell phone  Either texting, dialing  Or it's up by the ear  I really don't do it anymore  I used to do it  Became a father  Don't do it  But the other thing that stopped me  Was moving to my Droid  Where you can't feel the buttons  Oh yeah  With my BlackBerry  I was able to get some shit done  I knew where the letters were on the keyboard app  Yeah  Yeah, you can't do that with a 
[01:40:30]  No, so you have to look down a little more  When you have the Droid or the iPhone  And that prevents me from texting  I'm not going to sit here and make believe  I decided to turn over a new leaf  It just became harder in my world  It's just harder to do it  So I just don't do it  And then, you know, you throw a kid in the mix  Then you kind of start thinking a little smarter, I guess  But they want to ban the hands-free shit, too  Yeah, it's just dumb  And the cell phone companies are saying  Look, before we start getting crazy here  There's things we could do  You know, put some chips in the phone  Oh, fuck 
[01:41:00]  Did I just do that?  Damn it!  Damn it!  I knew right before the word even came out  I knew that was wrong  But they're going to put those things in the phones  Where if the car is moving at a certain speed, I guess  It shuts down your phone  What?  That's crazy  What if there's an emergency?  But that was one of the things they were considering  I remember that  But that's insane  Let's say you're being chased by somebody  You're trying to find a cop  Right  And, you know, you're trying to call 911  And your phone shuts off  I think that was one of the things they were at least talking about 
[01:41:30]  You'll probably be able to dial 911, by the way  Yeah, maybe a emergency  And I think hands-free should absolutely be okay  Do you ever have a problem when you're talking hands-free and driving?  Never  No  I don't think I have  I'll jerk it off, usually  See, with my Escalade  All I have to do is press a button on the steering wheel  And then say  I go like  Jim Norton  And then it'll be like  Dialing Jim Norton  So I don't even have to touch anything  Right  And then I just talk into my car 
[01:42:00]  Right  But to have the little Bluetooth on your ear  And then the phone  What does that entail, like, hands-free?  Do you still lay out  You still got to dial the fucking phone?  Is it voice activated?  What do you got to do?  What do you got to do?  Help me out here  I don't understand this new technology  I don't know  My hands-free went  Got fucked up  And, of course, like everything else in my life  I haven't gotten fixed up  Just haven't fixed it up  No  So I don't know  I guess  There's probably different times  I guess I used to have to, yeah  Do it on my phone  And then it would pop up  The second you have to dial a fucking phone 
[01:42:30]  You are a hazard  You're a torpedo  But isn't, um  You said it earlier  Isn't Siri, like, making it a little easier  Yep  To not look at your phone  You still have to  You know, you got to look down at some point  To get to the text  And then get to Siri  But I've done it a few times  Where I've pressed the button  And been like  Hi, Kenny  Gonna be five minutes  And then just, you know  People also like checking their Twitters  And their Facebook while they're driving  That's insane to me 
[01:43:00]  But they like doing it  No reason  And I was thinking the other day  I was driving out to Long Island  Why don't we have the technology  Where you can just listen to your tweets  Let's say  Oh, you can, yeah  I can't do that  I think you can do that  Let me see  Yeah, did he  Well, all of a sudden you go  You know, I want to listen to my Twitter as I drive  And, you know, just read all the tweets coming in  Do you really want to hear Twitter?  Well, I guess  You suck!  What are you guys doing?  You fucking suck!  You really want to hear that?  You guys!  I'm running it up for free speech now! 
[01:43:30]  I don't want to read these assholes  I think most people are just fed up with that, too  I've noticed a trend  Yeah?  Oh, yeah  See, I could  People are fine with those assholes  They're fighting back  I like it  I like it a lot  Can you read  Can you have your phone read your tweets, Ant?  Let me see  Because that's what they really should focus on  The cell phone companies immediately  Because the feds are on your heels  Get some shit out there 
[01:44:00]  Where it, you know  It totally goes hands-free  As far as texting and getting text messages  You know?  Yeah, let's  Hmm  No, I don't think  I don't think  Because Siri, that's the first  That's the first phase  That just came out  So that shit's going to get way better  You've got to think  In the coming months  Yeah  Who's pushing this shit?  Probably Apple  They're probably behind it  Because they have the best voice technology  They're behind it  Yeah, they do  No, that's just asking me to  Talk  I could do email  What does that bitch want?  Or I could do 
[01:44:30]  Texts  But you still got to push something on your phone  To get that going, right?  Yeah  Let me see if I can do a text here  Let me see if I can read a text  What do you mean read a text?  Like have it read a text  That's how we get the knowledge  I know, but  Maybe not  Let's see if we can do it like this  I'm going to do a text  Wait  All right  I know I can  Oh  Oh, this is disappointing  Indeed 
[01:45:00]  What?  You got it?  No, my love  Why'd you get it?  It's turning on my  Yep  Hi, baby  It's figuring it out  Oh, is it?  No  Slowly  No  Come on  It's supposed to read it, I think  It's not doing anything  I've had it do that, though  Like, I've read fucking texts 
[01:45:30]  I just don't remember how to do it  No  I'm an asshole  I wanted to read one of Kenneth  You have such a great body  I love that V  Oh, fuck  Jesus  What?  What?  I just got a text  So you're all for this?  Well, you know what?  Yeah  Yes  I'm all for this  But I think there are  What about banning phones completely from the car? 
[01:46:00]  No  Because that's  They usually start with something outrageous  And then they'll get something in between, right?  No  I kind of like the idea of  And it's not that I'm into big government, you douchebag  It's  This affects me  This affects me  As far as  I'm driving  If some ass fuck  Is  Swerving across traffic  Because he's texting  You know  That isn't me going  Yeah, I like big government  I just don't like an asshole  Plowing into me  In his fucking car  You know that 
[01:46:30]  You know that someone died  They had a whole piece on this  On one of the channels  Before we started broadcasting this morning  Yeah  And someone actually died  And the guy had a  They're getting a lot of these kids together  That actually did the text  Texting  To the person  That ended up reading it  And dying it  And one guy actually said  I'm sorry  But it made me laugh  He goes  All I texted was LOL  Can you imagine you're dying  Because you're reading someone's LOL text  That they sent you?  How worthless is that? 
[01:47:00]  Next thing I know  She was thrown through the passenger window  Over an LOL text  Oh  Fuck  Hey, cry me a fucking river  Whoa  Oh boy  That's my new character  Guy who's had enough  Guy who's had enough  Why do you have to slouch to do the character?  That's who I am  It's good  It's like  Hey, I've had enough  Yeah, these kids with their phones  Fuck them  Cry me a fucking river  Hey, these are phones  Hey, these are phones  Hey, these are phones  Cry me a fucking river 
[01:47:30]  Cry me a river  That's not gonna get old  No, no, no  I think, you know  You know what's not gonna get old?  That little punk who was texting  Cry me a fucking river  Yeah, it was LOL  That's what you get, punk  I give less than a shit, my friend  Less than a shit  Less than a shit  How's that possible?  I give just a little piece of the shit  This is so stupid  The characters run out of steam  MSNBC has Person of the Year  Time Magazine Person of the Year announced 
[01:48:00]  It's the protester  Is Person of the Year  That's time  But they're showing  And then it says  The Occupy movement expands  It's not the Occupy protesters  It's protesters  The people from, you know  Egypt last spring  And Syria  And Libya  And then you could throw in  The Occupy people  But it's not  You know, and guarantee  These Occupy people are gonna be  We're the cover of Time Magazine  It's not 
[01:48:30]  It's the protester  You just completely turned me  Because I was ready to go  Time sucks  But that does  But that makes sense  It was the year of the protester  Year of the protester  Not just the Occupy  Yeah, you're absolutely right, man  So for them to be like  Even on the news  Showing it like  The Occupy movement  Nah  Gets recognition  No, they don't  I think the Egypt thing  Was way fucking bigger  Oh, fuck yeah  That shit was unbelievable  That and Libya too  Libya's huge  They fucking  Oust a leader  That's been in there  For fucking ever  Since Reagan

[01:49:30]  What's that?  It's CNN's Ted Turner  Remember him?  Yes  Holy fuck  I forgot all about Ted Turner  History as it happens  I guess because of the  The way CNN  Brought that news  To the world  As it happened  True  That was very innovative  In 91  So that's 20 years ago  We started getting our news  Yes  Bill Clinton in 92  Well, they're 92  Nice  Alright, who do we got?  I like the Bill Clinton  Are you paying attention?  Did you like the Bill Clinton?  Jim spilled  Yeah, but if something happens

Uh, you know what?  At the time  I didn't like Bill Clinton  All that much  I didn't hate him  As much as other presidents  But  I say but  And then Jimmy's  But made a noise  I thought I was talking to it again  I'm the fart whisperer  But I think history 
[01:50:30]  Has kind of given Bill  A pretty good legacy  Okay  Past the blowjob thing  You know  Okay, sir  Um  93  Nelson Mandela  F.W.

She was crazy  Was she nutty?  She's the one that  We used to fucking  Have those  Take those tires  And with people that didn't like her  Point of view  She'd take tires  And fill them with gasoline  And put them around the people's necks  And light them on fire  I've seen footage of that  Crazy  No way  Crazy

[01:53:30]  In 99  For the new millennium of  Pussiness  What did this  Amazon  What do you do, character?  Amazon  Guy  Oh, it's Amazon  Amazon guy  Yeah, I told you  And won a game  Alright, let's go to 2000  2000  Wait, what?  Oh, they did person of the century  Oh, person of the century  Einstein's a good choice  Alvin Einstein  Why is he a good choice?  Of course  Because he was a nerd  I would have went Babe Ruth  Uh  Person of the century?  You know what? 
[01:54:00]  He was a good baseball player  I would have  I absolutely think I would have went Adolf Hitler  Whoa  I think he did more  To change the face  Of the 20th century  Than anyone else  In the 20th century  But did he though?  Like  Yes  More than Mussolini?  Yes  Or  Or more than fucking  Isaac  Or who was it?  I dropped the H-bomb  He made  The rest of the world  Take that next step  In technology  And morality  And just 
[01:54:30]  This  He really did  Believe me  Not praising the gentleman  But I am saying  He had an effect  On the 20th century  That I don't think  Any other single person  Had  I think Einstein  I disagree  I think Einstein  Was a good choice  Yeah but what did Einstein do?  You know what Einstein  It had something to do with family  It was the theory of relativity  Yeah but let me tell you something  Einstein became very popular  Because of the letter  He wrote to Roosevelt  About the need to have an atomic bomb  Because he thought the Germans 
[01:55:00]  Were already developing the atomic bomb  So again  Hitler comes into play  Even on fucking  Einstein's dying  But what Einstein  What Hitler did is  Einstein's dying  Hitler's gonna be a blur  A blip  Even a terrible terrible blip  Oh I don't know  Look you still look at Genghis Khan  No no no  But I mean  And they're like  They're horrible periods  But what we learned from Einstein  Changed everything  Like it's going  It continues  It's gonna change the way you live forever  It continues  As a race  As a species  I think we're looking at the same type of effects 
[01:55:30]  But on opposite ends of the spectrum  You know  Like I think Hitler will always be  Looked at as  What man's potential for evil is  Right  Greater than the man himself  You know what I mean?

[02:06:00]  Since TV's been TV  Right  And now they're just getting around to  Where they're saying  Hey we don't like your loud commercials  Right  I hate that  You're watching a TV show  And it's very quiet  You can barely hear what the fucking  People on the show are saying  And then it's like  Oh run  To  Bears  The furniture  For  The local commercials are the worst too  Well they did a little  Five hundred dollars cash  Shut the fuck up  They did a little study  So they're watching Clueless on E

[02:07:00]  You guys gotta get TVs with smaller speakers  Oh is that it?  Surround sound that's a problem  Oh is the surround sound a problem?  You would think that there would be a sound system  That  Because you're not  I don't think anybody but Sam  Is listening to  Sound that's coming directly out of their television  Really?  It usually goes through a sound system  And that system itself  Would  Instantly equalize the volume  To whatever you  DB  You have it set at  So why the fuck  Don't they have that? 
[02:07:30]  I don't know  And don't tell me they do  Cause I've looked  And they don't have it  They used to make a thing  That they targeted towards old people  That you could put on the back of your TV  What?

How about asparagus?  Yeah.  I like asparagus.  What are we going to do?  We're like, I'll lay asparagus on my body and you can eat it off. 
[03:12:30]  I did that one time with cold spinach.  I told the girl, just throw it in your pussy.  I'll lick it right out.  She threw spinach in her pussy.  I ate it right out for like two hours.  Sexy.  Two hours?  Two hours.  It took that long to find it?  That's great.  One time I threw a bunch of cream corn on there.  I fucking licked it right out like it was denim or something.  Well, you're way with words there, Chip.  Yeah, licking cream corn out of there.  We've had a lot of success with vegetables over the years in this show.

What's wrong with Y-Frog?  I don't know.  There's nothing showing.  They all stink.  Like, which service does I Like Girls Daily use? 
[03:18:30]  Fantastic.  Just quiet.  No idea.  It's a quiet radio show.  It's great.  Someone fucking help me out.  We like to ponder.  Yeah, because we got really good pictures that we want to share to people.  Imgur.com.  Yeah, I've seen them.  Are they good?  I don't know.  Someone's just saying.  You know what?  Someone says, I still see the photo, Opie.  I don't think so.  Do you think?  No, it says photo removed.  I just got it.  Photo has been removed. 
[03:19:00]  So I say, if Y-Frog is removing photos like that, I say we all stop using Y-Frog.  Photo's still there, it says.  Imgur.  It's not there.  They got to maybe refresh their pearls.  Yeah, refresh.  What is your Twitter name?  Generosha Blake.  Oh, well, well, Jimmy Norton's fault.  What are we going to do?  Shh.  Oh, well, shh.  It's our little secret.  What are we going to do?  I don't know.  No, I don't think it's there.  I see it. 
[03:19:30]  What?  It's showing up on your Twitter.  Then how the fuck did it say photo removed?  I have photo removed.  What were you looking at?  Everyone refresh right now.  Everyone refresh.  Okay.  Let's see what happens.  All right, that's better.  I like that.  Is it still there now?  Yeah, it's still there.  No, it's still there.  Oh, shit.  No.  I think people are talking.  Maybe it's being slammed so much.  That's the wrong photo.  You're talking about the one where it was just her. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  With the handbook.  Holding my boobs.  Oh, you idiot.  It's just a dumb lesbian.  You ruined everything.  He's got bleach in his brain or something.  Ever since you started doing those Stop the Insanity commercials.  Susan Powder.  Powder?  Susan Pounder.  He's heavy.  He's heavy sex.  Yeah, that's amazing.  He's a big boy.  Hold on, Opie.  I'm going to check right now on Wafrog.  Oh.  Nah, I think it's Wafrog.  Ah, Frog Jettler. 
[03:20:30]  That's stupid, man.  Nothing was showing.  It's gone.  It's gone, right?  Wafrog stinks.  So I say everyone fucking blows off Wafrog and tell them why.  Frog?  Yeah.  We all got to work together with this shit.  Enough already.  All right.  And as in enough already, let's go home.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Put your clothes on, I guess.  Thanks.  Lainey, thanks once again for a wonderful experience.  Take it easy.  Penthouse Pet of the Year.  Jenna Rose Triple X on Twitter.  Not the triple part, though.  Just do XXX.  Yes.  All right. 
[03:21:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Sirius X out.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Opie, you're not out of the door yet.  You're still on the show, technically.  What's that, Roland?  It's a broken clipboard?  What do we got out?  Travis got mad?  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:21:30]  I got to go.  There's only one of them's autograph, though.  They're tight.  Oh.  Look what the After Show has prizes for the listeners.  What she should do is autograph her clit.  What did you say, Eric?  How many people have, like, autographs of clits?  Eric, say it on the air.  I can't hear him.  I don't have headphones.  I know.  He's just saying it into my ear.  Because I didn't want to interrupt Opie talking.  That's why I was talking to you.  What's up, A?  No, you can't give those away on the air.  What?  Can't give those away on the air.  Why?  Can't do porn giveaways on the air. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, Christ.  My bad.  My bad.  Can't do adult material.  It's against the law.  Why don't you have a little something to jerk yourself off to?  I guess everyone should just follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio, and then we'll figure out how  to give them away.  What?  You're not going to give anything away.  You're just trying to insert a cheap...  Was that plug really awkward?  That one could be my worst one yet.  By far.  That was a bad one.  I'm going to go Sambo.  All right.  Dicks in the ass.  Dicks in the ass for Roland.  Why dicks in the ass for you today?  Oh, you left the computer on.  Did he fall asleep during the movie yesterday? 
[03:22:30]  I forgot to ask you.  Oh, Mission Impossible?  Well, the movie was so good, I didn't look at Roland to see if he was falling asleep like he  does every other movie.  Well, see, here's the thing.  You can't ask Roland now if he fell asleep during the movie after we have the guests in  and he doesn't have to deal with the publicists anymore.  No, no, because we all know it's because he's tired.  Yeah, but he still won't admit that he fell asleep.  He warned me, Sam.  I walked in, he goes, I might fall asleep.  I'm really tired.  In Mission Impossible?  Yeah, he was really tired though.  But that means the movie's really good because there's Roland who usually falls asleep when  he's not tired and he's really tired before Mission Impossible starts and he didn't 
[03:23:00]  fall asleep.  Did you really not fall asleep?  That should be on a poster.  Roland did not fall asleep.  No, there was so much action and everything.  It was awesome.  Roland Campos says, I was awake.  I was.  I'm so proud of myself.  Sam, plug my shit.  I mean, if I get to it, we'll see.  You know, you have a show you can plug and I have a show where I'll do what I want.  And if Matt Fastow's listening, can you order me another clipboard?  Who's Matt Fastow?  Because Travis broke my clipboard.  All right.  I mean, well...  Because Matt listens to the after show, so...  What happened with your... 
[03:23:30]  And he does the office supplies here?  Yeah.  What happened to the clipboard that Travis broke it?  I don't know.  It was angry.  Whatever.  I don't know what you're talking about half the time, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Sal.  Yes.  Rough one for you, huh?  Oh, no.  It was within your reach.  It was almost there for you.  It's totally fine.  Here's what happened.  Sal, the intern, he's the good one.  We had Jenna Rose, who's the penthouse pet of the year.  And I'll say this.  I'll go out on a limb and say she's exceptionally good looking. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Somebody was going to get to feel up her boobies.  Well, no shit.  Roland, I'm turning them off.  Listen, it's obvious to you, but it might not be obvious to everybody.  Yeah, somebody was going to get to feel up her breasts in substitution for the lousy intern.  And your name was brought up.  Yeah.  You were right there.  I got the green light. 
[03:24:30]  But then you realize, like, listen, you can get on management's case for a lot of stuff,  but the O.B. and Anthony internship experience is not like many in the sense that, you know,  you get to interact with a lot of different people.  You get to do a lot of different things.  I have to say, it's hard to get mad when management says, listen, we can't let these kids who are here to learn and earn college credit  go in and feel up porn stars' titties and choke them.  You can understand where management is coming from with that. 
[03:25:00]  I completely, completely understand, but I'm happy that someone did, and props to Troy, he did a fucking great job.  You were disappointed, though.  Well, I mean, honestly, I mean, you know.  Yeah, it would have been cool if I did.  From a human perspective.  From a human perspective, yeah.  I mean, she's way hotter in person than she is in the magazine.  And she looks good in the magazine, so it's like.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, props to Troy.  Like I said, Troy is fucking doing a really good job.  It was pretty funny, actually.  You like those autographed magazines?  Yeah, I do.  Why don't you take one for yourself?  Aw, thank you.  Why don't you take a magazine for yourself?  Now, there is a chance you might have to, that may be confiscated by management. 
[03:25:30]  I don't know if that's appropriate or not.  But, still, take a magazine for yourself.  Thank you.  And you can go ahead, here at SiriusXM, all the stalls have locks on the doors.  So, go ahead and take that magazine in there and just think about what it would have been like.  Sure.  To touch her.  And can I have Matt clean up the rest of the studio in the meantime?  Actually, I'd rather, to tell you the truth, I'd rather you did it.  And this is only because I don't want him in here. 
[03:26:00]  You know what I mean?  Okay, that's fine.  I'm sorry, Roland, I turned that off.  I didn't.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, and that's the only reason.  I mean.  Thanks, Al.  Ant made his feelings on the intern who's not Sal.  Perfectly well known today.  Oh, yeah.  Can I just say thank you to ONA for even extending that offer.  They both, like, confirmed it.  I thought that was great.  It was really nice.  But, you know.  You understand.  I completely understand.  Where's Troy at?  But I would like to see, because Troy really came in here like, he was.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, hey, hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Really, Sam?  Really, Sam?  Troy was in here with Jenna Rose. 
[03:26:30]  And we really got a glimpse.  I mean, Troy keeps it real when he's on the air.  Whether he's making friends or enemies, he's an honest guy on this radio show.  Is that right?  Right, Troy?  Always.  And, I mean, you came in here, and we did get a taste of, I'll call him Bedroom Troy.  Yeah.  Of what it's like.  Oh, yeah.  Because you weren't, you know, you had a chance.  You got Jenna Rose in here.  Yeah.  Who is.  Gorgeous.  Really.  Unbelievable.  Stunning in person.  And a lot of times, these girls look like hags.  Yeah.  They're really just fucking run through the mill.  But, but like Sal said, she looks better. 
[03:27:00]  She looks great in the magazine.  She looks even better in person.  Luckily, she still has youth on her side.  She looks like Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Because a lot of times, some of these broads.  Well, Britney Spears then, not now.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, these, these girls will just look, run through the fucking mill.  And it's funny, because on Instagram, too, I follow a couple of porn stars on there.  Do they post, like, nudies?  Nah, not really, but they, they post hot shots.  Nudies.  What type of person calls them?  Nudies.  Do they post nudies?  And it's, it's funny, because I think most girls want to be considered, or feel sexy when  they're natural, like, like, um, no makeup on. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  And some of these girls just look like they're run through the fucking mill.  Yeah.  And, uh.  Like you said, I mean, when Jenna Rose said she was born in 1991.  Yeah.  That made me feel old.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I can't imagine for someone like you, but, so you are.  Well, I'm not that much older than you, but I clearly remember 1991.  I know, so do I.  It's really, it's a little depressing.  Yeah.  Um, but you came in here, uh, the intern rule, which I mean, is not so much a rule as 
[03:28:00]  it is, I mean, kind of like a law, like, it probably, when you, when management says,  are we really having interns do this, all you can say is, you know what, you're right  on this one, I think.  I don't think interns need to, but staff members, that's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, it sucks for the interns, because that's one of the little perks of, like, okay, I'm  doing this job for free.  Yeah.  You know, oh, man, I get to fill up this penthouse bitch, you know.  But you took the bull by the horn.  I did.  Hey, man.  I had to, somebody had to step up to the plate.  And the tits.  The bull by the tits, I'll say.  Yeah.  Um.  I think I may have scared her, too, a little bit. 
[03:28:30]  Were you at all, did you start to get any sort of action in the pants there?  No.  Any growth.  No growth.  I mean, obviously, she's an attractive girl.  Did you push against her?  The pelvis?  Not really.  I mean, you don't want to be too much of a fucking creep.  Because, you know what I mean?  It's a fine line.  Because it really is, it's, it's, you have to think about her.  Like, she's, she's naked in front of, in front of a room of dudes.  And the dudes, everybody in the room is frothing at the mouth.  Yeah.  And she doesn't know what's going on.  Right.  Because one minute, Ant did the classic Ant, where he was, I wasn't sure if he was going 
[03:29:00]  to get mad at you, to tell you the truth.  Because Ant was in classic Ant form, where within five minutes, he said, he said, I  remember this.  He goes, oh, you're from California too.  We should go out.  And it's like, it's so great.  But the way he does it is so nonchalant.  It's just like.  I'm just kidding, bud.  Like, this makes, this makes sense.  Like, we should go out or, hey, you know, I got a bar in my house.  Like, what's he saying?  I mean, how do I compete with Ant?  I mean, he, you know.  But then you got Jim, who's doing Chip for half the interview, and she don't know what's  going on with him.  Then you got Opie, who's, uh, has to make it awkward. 
[03:29:30]  Hang on one sec.  Hotline, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Hey, put me on the phone.  It's Chip off.  Oh, good.  Chip, uh, you're on the air.  Put me on the, put me on the radio.  It's Chip off.  I heard you the first time.  I already said you're on the air.  We have to fault with the show.  It's on the, you're on the show right now.  I fucked that girl, the penthouse girl.  I fucked her.  No, you didn't fuck her.  You, you mock, you, you, you kind of dry humped her somewhat, but not really. 
[03:30:00]  I fucked her.  No, I didn't.  I took her in the stairs, and I fucked her good, a couple times.  There's no way you did that.  She's like, I'm going to come, Chipper.  I'm like, yeah, you're going to come so much, you might start going.  We was laughing.  She called you Chipper?  Yeah, she's calling me Chipper D.  This is what, what's that?  Well, when I was watching you in action, Chip, and, and talking how you talk to girls, I  was wondering, did, because you, you let out a couple one-liners while you were mock-fucking  her.  Uh, do you ever worry that the girl is going to laugh at one of your jokes and kind of 
[03:30:30]  get thrown out of the mood?  No, because they like to laugh and come at the same time.  I call it laugh-coming, and that's what they do.  They laugh and come all over the place.  I told her, you're going to be like, there's a bunch of clowns on your pussy or something.  Laugh-cumming is not a clever way to put those two words together.  Yeah, I'm like, you want to laugh-cum or something, bitch?  I fucked her so good by the steps.  I don't believe you.  I wouldn't lie about that.  I was fucking up, and she was like, oh, you're fucking me so much better than the Playboy 
[03:31:00]  people did.  It's Penthouse, Chip.  She's on the cover of this month's Penthouse.  What's that?  Penthouse.  Never mind.  What did you think?  You got to see Troy in action right before you were in action.  What do you think of the way he handles the women?  It's pretty lame.  You don't know what he's doing.  He's all trying to whisper in the rear.  You just got to yell that stuff.  Like, what would you yell?  I'm fucking you good, huh?  Take these.  What do you like?  These apples or something?  Oh, that's actually pretty good. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't even think the apples angle is a good route to go down.  I told her.  I said, I feel you pussy like it's a lifeboat, and my dick is a bunch of survivants.  That's horrible.  It's not even like...  Do you ever get bashful saying all this stuff publicly?  Because usually, you know, this is intimate stuff.  I say I told her that my you-know-what is like the Titanic.  I'm going to stick it right in the ocean until the body's falling out of it. 
[03:32:00]  She gets it.  My first problem was that you called it a you-know-what while you were fucking this girl.  And the second problem was a Titanic reference where you bring up all the people that died.  Well, you know, you kind of pay homage, you know?  Well, thank you very much, Chip.  Thanks.  What are you, wrapping up or something?  Yeah, I'm wrapping you up.  I mean, that was a good line to go out on.  No, I got a better line to go out on.  Okay.  I would be on a Titanic, and I'm like, I don't take sinking ships. 
[03:32:30]  That was a horrible line to go out on.  You had it.  I just followed that with something better.  No, you didn't.  All right, I'll type you later.  Where you going?  I'm going to hang up the phone on you, Chip.  Hey, how about some Argentium or something?  I wish you had to read it in front of you, because I would let you read it right now.  I don't know how to do it.  Hey, Stephen's thinking about some Argentium. 
[03:33:00]  Real silver's made out of copper and, like, and hats.  But Argentium is made out of silver that they shine up and stuff.  That's right.  Where can they get it?  What's that?  Where can they get the Argentium?  It's from that one corner of Walnut and 37.  No, it's 8th.  8th and Walnut is their address.  The other corner.  Stephen Drummer.  No, Stephen Singer.  Stephen Singer.  You know where his website is?  Yeah, it's like you can get the silver, you can get the Argentium. 
[03:33:30]  No, it's super silver.  Oh, the website?  Yeah.  I think it's Stephen's Jewelry Place or something.  It's IHateStevenSinger.com is the answer.  What's that?  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Okay.  Okay, and then what's the phone number, Chip?  Stephen Singer.  Hey, what is he in a band or something?  It's 888.  It's a good joke.  No, we got to finish the read. 
[03:34:00]  You can't go out.  It's 888.  IHateStevenSinger.  He's on the other corner.  He's on the other corner of Walnut.  Walnut?  Yeah.  Look at this nut on the wall.  What is he?  What is he in the nut house or something?  Well, you'd think...  A big laugh.  You'd think he was in the nut house how low his prices are.  What's that?  His prices are low, Chip.  That's all I'm saying.  He offers jewelry at very discounted prices.  That's stupid.  No, it's not stupid. 
[03:34:30]  It's a service to the people,  and he especially likes, you know, O&A fans  and fans after O&A Live.  We should have went out on the big laugh.  I said the Argentium joke was good.  All right.  So why don't we end this with...  I guess you could redo it.  All right.  Hey, Steven Singer's got some Argentium.  What's the matter?  Did somebody steal all of silver?  That doesn't make any sense.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  That's it.  Okay.  Chip, thank you for helping me out with that. 
[03:35:00]  What's that?  Thank you for helping me out with the read.  Eh, sure.  You know, I'll try to get you some bucks for it.  Yes, you can get me a few clams.  Good one.  I love the way you use slang.  Yes, and dollarinis.  I got you.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling in, Chip.  All right.  Yes, you're...  I'm going to hang up now.  Chad.  Okay, bye.  That was good.  I did try to...  You're still on the phone.  Hello when I call up. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  It was crazy.  What's that?  You're still on the air.  No, I hung up already.  No, you didn't hit the button, Chip.  I'm just telling Kenny how good I did.  You didn't do that great.  You're still on the air.  That's how we're talking.  How come there are those people in the city?  Chip, I'm going to hang up on you now.  They shouldn't be done.  They're human.  All right, Chip.  Thanks for calling in.  Okay.  All right, bye. 
[03:36:00]  See ya.  I hate that motherfucker.  Chip, I'm right here.  You called me.  Hang up.  What's he doing?  Hang up the phone.  You stop.  I'm listening to the radio.  Okay, he's gone.  Okay, he's gone.  Thank God.  Troy, Chip, with some harsh words for your performance. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, it's okay.  You don't mind.  It's hard to fuck with Chip, you know?  Yeah.  It's because it's not so much that you feel like your performance was under his, but it's  more like, if I start fucking with him, he's going to fuck with me back.  And once those zingers start coming.  It's just, it's a fight I don't really want to, I don't want to pick.  Is it awkward for you to come in here and have to show how you would perform sexually  on her while she's nude in front of all of us?  Well, of course, because these guys are just waiting to fucking demolish you for whatever 
[03:37:00]  you do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But you came in here, like, Anthony described Ron Bennington as cocksure the other day.  Yeah.  You were cocksure this morning.  Oh, I think I fuck pretty good, so.  You do?  I don't know.  Roland?  What?  Does Troy fuck good?  Fantastic.  Okay, good.  I mean, Roland usually doesn't like a dick in the ass, but from Troy.  He'll take it.  It's all the technique, am I right?  The cloth.  The cloth.  And what was the vibe after that's all done? 
[03:37:30]  Well, it is weird because, you know, she's sitting there, she puts her clothes back on,  and then it's like, oh, cool, thank you, all right.  You know, it's just, I don't know, it's weird, yeah.  Did we experience something here?  Yeah.  Was there a spark?  Between me and her?  No, I don't think so.  No, there was no romance there?  No, she, when he walked by, she was, oh, who's that?  I go, that's a resident hunk.  You called him a hunk?  He was.  I don't believe him.  I think, we had an argument a few weeks ago about who's the cool guy on the show.  Oh, boy.  Are we going down this road yet?  No, no, no, that didn't go well.  I would think you're the hunk on the show, though. 
[03:38:00]  I think Roland's right about that.  Yeah, he's like the Fonzie.  Who else would be the hunk, then?  Sex.  You think sex is the hunk?  Well, after the blonde, no.  Eric, how did you feel when Penthouse Pet of the Year, Jenna Rose, came in here and  said that your hair made you look like a lesbian?  Well, I told Roland outside that I realized my hair looks like Tank Girl.  Yeah, it does look a little like Tank Girl.  What was that actress's name?  Lori Petty?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it kind of fits in the whole lesbian.  How do you, you think people have been a little unfair with their reactions to your new 
[03:38:30]  do?  No, I didn't expect, I didn't expect anyone to like this.  Well, what is it?  Is it, like Troy brought up to me when he was, he sent me a message, for those that  don't know, E-Rock, the sex bagel, the sex man, Prince Nagel, came into work yesterday  after taking a four day weekend with bleach blonde hair.  So we've all been reacting to it in different ways.  Troy, you messaged me and said you think it's because E-Rock back in the day, in the 90s, 
[03:39:00]  when he was cool, or he thought he was cool, had his bleach blonde hair.  I think I may even have a picture here of him with blonde hair.  He used to do this a lot.  Yeah, back in the day.  Because we haven't seen him like this in, I mean, seven years.  When was the last time you did that?  2004, right before the show started.  But you used to do it a lot.  Yeah, I used to do the blonde mixed into my regular hair color.  I never did it like this.  So do you think, Troy, that he's trying to get back to those cool days? 
[03:39:30]  Here's what I think, and I don't know, I can't speak for Eric, but you know how people  from the 80s, sometimes what they thought made them cool in the 80s still works, or whatever  era, like people that had mullets.  Yeah.  You know, like, they'll still rock a mullet, because in high school, that was cool, man.  Right, like when Billy Ray Cyrus brings his mullet back, he's at a certain age now, times  have changed now, it doesn't exactly work anymore. 
[03:40:00]  Right, or like, you know, dudes that still rock mustaches, not for the ironic way, but  like, they're still rocking it, because in the 70s, you had a mustache, Tom Selleck.  Yeah, exactly.  Burt Reynolds.  Exactly.  So in the 90s, you have to think what was cool then.  It was, you know, everybody bleached blonde in their hair like Eminem.  Yeah, I mean, this is true.  This hasn't been a great look since at least...  98, 99.  I would say you could go as far as 2001.  You'd still be, you'd be a little lame, like you'd be, you'd be at the end of the spectrum. 
[03:40:30]  You're on the end of it, yeah.  But still acceptable.  Um, are you trying to, is that what you're trying to do with Iraq, trying to relive some  of those...  But like, what I was trying to say, I don't mean to cut Eric off, but those were his sort  of glory days.  That's when he was sort of like, he was young, he was badass.  He was, he was cool.  I mean, yeah, he did his, he did his thing, you know what I mean?  Like, but, you know, he, he, he kind of rolled with some people that, you know, that was kind  of the, had a little bit of an edge and, and dyed their hair blonde at that time. 
[03:41:00]  And that kind of what gave him like a, oh, this guy's different.  You know what I mean?  So...  And you're saying that like, I think he's...  That edge is kind of, is kind of lost.  Yeah.  I think he kind of wants to come back to it.  Like, look, I'm still, I'm still a little, I have a little bit of an edge still.  Do you have a rambutious Iraq story about his edge?  No.  I don't know.  Was he a take no shit type of guy though?  Uh, I mean...  He was still kind of sex bagley.  I mean, he's, he was sex bagley.  I mean...  He was.  Yeah.  But he just felt like he had a little more edge. 
[03:41:30]  Eric, are you trying to do, is that, is Troy accurate at all?  That I'm trying to go back to, to that time period?  No, not that you're trying to bring everybody back.  Like mentally, you felt like in the late nineties, you were a little more edgy.  You were a little cool.  You had youth on your side.  You were like, you had your fingers up.  Fuck you.  I'm fucking Eric Nagel.  I'm the man.  I'm going to go...  I'm going to take over the world.  Yeah.  I'm going to accomplish this shit.  I'm going to get er done.  I have a boat.  Yeah.  I have a fucking boat, motherfucker. 
[03:42:00]  Who comes to Florida and doesn't stop by my house?  That guy, Eric.  That guy.  Not the 40 year old man we see in front of us.  I was in Florida at that time.  Okay.  You must have been on a trip or something.  But not the guy that we see in front of us.  Is this, are you trying to bring back, fuck the world, I have bleach blonde hair because  it was cool then, Eric Nagel?  No.  You're not?  No.  Because back then, I didn't do it to this extent where the whole head was just this 
[03:42:30]  like blonde hair.  See, I don't, I remember differently.  But it's not so much like...  No, I did blonde with like colors mixed in, but I never did.  No, I've seen you completely blonde.  But either way...  I think I even have pictures of it.  It's not, the hue is not what we're debating.  Right.  It's the mental state.  No, I'm not trying to go back to that time period in my life.  You're not trying to get a little of that edge back?  No, not at all.  I mean, you've lost the edge since you've been on the show.  You understand that?  Like, you're not somebody that people would refer to as edgy anymore. 
[03:43:00]  Okay.  Is that something that you want to have back?  No.  You don't want to be an edgy guy?  No.  What did you say, Paul?  Eric compared it to getting a tattoo this morning when he described it to me.  You consider this like getting a tattoo?  Yeah, no, as far as the impulse of it, like, I was just, I kept saying, I'm going to do  it, I'm going to do it, and then finally I went and did it.  After I beat Cosmos.  And it's like people who go and get, like, a really bad tattoo on an impulse, you know,  like, that never had a tattoo. 
[03:43:30]  They're like, I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it, finally they went out and fucking  did it.  You're like a sorority girl who couldn't handle her liquor one night.  Sure, why not?  Like, what do you mean a bad tattoo on an impulse?  Are you talking about Troy's DeLorean logo again?  No.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  I'm just kidding.  I mean, my thing is, if you're going to do it, why would you rock a hat?  Like, why wouldn't you just, why wouldn't you have it styled and come in here guns fucking  blazing?  Because Jim hadn't seen it yet.  Yeah, but what about yesterday when Jim wasn't here?  Because they hadn't seen it yet.  Well, what's the difference?  Why wouldn't you just walk in and be like, here it is? 
[03:44:00]  Presentation.  Yeah, I get that.  Wouldn't you want it styled as opposed to hat head?  No, because they didn't know I had it until later in the show.  Yeah, but if you walk into the goddamn studio in the morning.  Then the reactions one is not on the air.  Then they'll talk about it as soon as they fucking light up the mics.  Yeah, but they want the reaction on the air.  Oh, okay.  Eric, he's got an argument there.  I mean, I would definitely say, especially today, you want Jim's argument.  I mean, I could say, whether it's true or not, who knows, but I would definitely say  Eric's got a strong enough argument that, you know, he might have been saving it for 
[03:44:30]  the air.  And I would have hoped that he would have.  So, I get that.  But, and I will say, he doesn't seem ashamed of this.  Because, like, when he was around asking everybody what they thought of his new hairdo, this wasn't  something that I concocted.  Like, Eric was showing people his haircut.  Right.  And then I grabbed a recorder.  So, I don't think he's, he's not hiding it.  I just think that, I don't think that he's being truthful about the motivations.  Like, some people have been saying, Sam, like, you have wacky hair, too. 
[03:45:00]  But it's not like I had a buzz cut and then one day I came in with giant hair.  Right.  This is just what I've transitioned into and this is how I'm comfortable now.  Right.  And that's actually how the hair comes out of your head and you just choose to keep it  longer.  Right.  Like, I didn't say, I need, I want to do this because, you know, I need a change.  Right.  You know, when people make drastic changes, there is a catalyst.  Like, when you get a tattoo.  Especially in your 30s.  Yeah.  When you do it as a kid, you're just trying to find out who you are as a human being.  Right.  There is something that you're trying to get through this way. 
[03:45:30]  Like, when you get a tattoo at, you know, after you're 28, say.  Right.  Like, if I got a tattoo at 28, there would be something behind it.  Right.  Like, even if it was a dumb tattoo, it's like, okay.  I got this because of this.  Or, you know, like, Sam, honestly, let's break this down.  You got that because you want to be edgier.  You want to be this.  You don't feel comfortable in that.  I, I, Eric, I think there's a reason.  There's no reason.  You're, you're looking way too into this. 
[03:46:00]  And you know the fact that I've been talking about doing this for a while.  Eric was talking about it for a long time.  And then I just finally go, you know what?  I'm going to finally do it now.  Yeah.  And I did it.  That was it.  It was just, there's no, like, underline behind it.  Like, well, what was the motivation?  There's got to be something that forced you to do it.  Tell me if Brandon in Missouri is right.  He's feedbacking in.  Eric is bringing sexy back.  Is that what the goal is?  No, that's not.  That's what, and you said that the other day.  I did?  Yeah, you said that to me on Tuesday.  You know what I said off the air that I wish I had said on the air when we were doing 
[03:46:30]  E-Rock jokes?  That E-Rock now looks like the lead singer of My Chemical Sweetener Romance.  That's a good one.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I just wanted to share that with everybody.  No, I know.  You understand.  Because you ran, no, we were in the office and you got all mad at yourself.  Because I didn't say it on the air.  And he said, oh, I got to tell you this.  And he's like, no offense, but, and then you played that out.  No offense, but here's an insult.  This is, I thought we should replay.  Eric bleached his hair and he was going around showing all the girls at SiriusXM his new 
[03:47:00]  haircut and his new hairdo.  I wanted to document that for all the listeners and to get a poll.  Because, look, the problem here is that no matter what Eric did to his hair, his self,  no matter what he did, he'd get shit on it for it here.  Right, Eric?  Like, you knew that going in.  It doesn't matter.  No.  Like, you will get shit on for it here, on the show.  So, I wanted to see, let's go outside the show. 
[03:47:30]  Let's hear what the, you know, the friendly people on the music channels or whatever,  Eric's, people he's cool with, are saying about it.  And this is what we recorded.  Julia from XMU.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  You know the sex bagel Eric Nagel, right?  I love the sex bagel Eric Nagel.  Wait till you see his new hairdo.  Show him, E-Rock.  Oh my God.  Why did you do that?  Alex, the producer extraordinaire for Sirius XM Hits 1.  You know, Eric the sex bagel, right? 
[03:48:00]  Of course.  Show him your new haircut.  Oh my God.  Oh shit.  Oh God.  I am speechless.  What?  What did you do?  Speechless in like a horrible way.  I don't know.  It's just so different.  Taylor from Wake Up With Taylor.  Hey, what's up?  You know E-Rock, right?  Sex bagel.  What?  Who?  The sex bagel.  The sex bagel?  Yeah, Eric Nagel.  No, I didn't know you, the sex bagel. 
[03:48:30]  Have you ever met him before?  Never.  Okay, well then tell me what you think of his look.  Take off your hat, Eric.  Oh wow, you look like, are you gay?  You look like a fabulous gay man.  I like it.  That's a compliment.  Yeah, it is.  I like it though.  I mean, if you're, you know, if you're going to go dance in a cage tonight, I like it.  Mina from the heat, what do you think of E-Rock's hair?  It's interesting.  You don't like it?  It doesn't match his skin tone.  As a female, do you find him more or less attractive physically? 
[03:49:00]  I don't want to hurt his feelings.  So that's less then?  Sam, I don't.  Are you going through it?  What's that, Eric?  I'll answer it for you.  Yes, that would be less.  Wow, Madison from Alt Nation.  You know E-Rock the sex bagel, don't you?  Yeah, he just looked at my tits.  You bet he did.  All right, now I'm done.  Well, you remember what he used to look like, right?  Yeah.  Take off your hat, E-Rock.  Oh.  My.  Ah!  What the fuck, man? 
[03:49:30]  Madal from Dirty Dog.  You know E-Rock, right?  Yes.  You know what he looks like, right?  Or what he looked like, I should say.  Yes.  Take off your hat.  What?  What is that?  Why did you do that?  He bleached it.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan.  No.  No.  Not at all.  I don't even have to squeeze that out of you.  I liked her.  Yeah.  Because she was just like the most honest, unapologetic. 
[03:50:00]  Those were the women of SiriusXM hearing about, or seeing E-Rock's new hairdo for the first  time after he bleached it.  You know what I'd love to see?  Like, if you're going to make a statement, and you're going to be like, okay, I'm going  to do something crazy.  Wouldn't you love to see Eric, okay, he bleaches his hair, he comes in with like a fucking throat  tattoo, you know, or like starts wearing like leather coats.  Yeah.  And gets you jacked.  And chains dripping off the sleeves.  And he's just like, and you're like, dude, what the fuck?  He's like, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Do something about it then. 
[03:50:30]  Hit his chest.  Do something about it.  Don't say something fucking stupid.  And then he'd be like, whoa, what the fuck is this?  But I really liked when Taylor from Cosmo Radio, who had never met Eric before, asked  if he was gay.  Yeah.  Based on the haircut.  Yeah, I can see that.  That's a very flamboyant.  You think so?  Yeah.  Eric, are you at all thinking that you're going to go this route that Troy discussed  of, fuck you guys, I'm the bully around the block.  Like, you thought Troy was the Fonz, you ain't seen nothing yet.  That's like the equivalent to putting in fluorescent legs. 
[03:51:00]  Laces in your shoes.  Well, mouth.  You're like, I'm wild.  But it's like, dude, it's just laces.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Like, take the plunge.  Like, would you get like a, you know, a leather jacket with a big Dead Kennedys patch  on the back?  Yeah.  And like, you know, tight jeans cut off at the shins with Doc Martens and just start  jelling your hair and get jacked up and throw the fingers up?  Fuck you guys.  Sons of Anarchy.  Wow.  I mean, that's a little more punk than Sons of Anarchy, but Eric?  Yeah, I don't think that's me. 
[03:51:30]  Okay, it's not, okay, it's not you.  Um, how did you feel about the reaction that the girls had?  Um, pretty much what I expected.  Why?  Other than Taylor's comments, but yeah.  You didn't think, you didn't, you thought people would dislike it, but you didn't think  the gay thing.  I think I've met her before, but maybe I didn't.  Why, I guess she didn't make an impact.  No.  Um, well, I mean, I got to commend you on one level that you've, you've, you've taken,  Roland, Roland was asleep in here a minute ago. 
[03:52:00]  He said, you're so unhealthy, Roland.  You're just, I fear for you all the time because you are so unhealthy.  But, as I was saying about E-Rock, um, and, and that's only because I love you.  I'm praying for E-Rock too.  You are.  You think?  Um, I got to respect the fact that he's coming in and he's like, yeah, I knew I would get  shit on for this, but I just want to.  So that's it.  It's kind of cool.  Do you think he just, he's in need of attention?  No, because I'm not, I'm not looking for airtime.  I'm not looking to be more of a, uh, fixture for, uh, for the barbs of this show. 
[03:52:30]  Louis C.K. brought that up on the show yesterday.  Yeah.  I don't think, Eric's never been the attention guy like some of our interns have been.  He's not the guy.  But that's an honest assessment coming from Louis.  No, it is.  I'm not, I'm not saying that Louis was, you know, mischievous because he doesn't know  you.  Yeah, he doesn't know.  Like the rest of us know you.  Eric doesn't go for negative attention and he gets plenty of attention.  But it's like, it's like when people said I was jealous of intern Matt for the airtime. 
[03:53:00]  And I was like, guys, like I have a show.  Like I do the whole 10 o'clock hour.  I'm not, I'm not at the point where I'm jealous of people for airtime anymore.  Can I throw a theory out there?  Yeah.  Tell me what you think about this.  Okay.  Um, Eric maybe hasn't had an increase of Twitter followers lately.  Just hear me out.  Hear me out.  Hear me out.  And you know, and you know, Sam, in his world, that's one of the most important things.  I didn't know.  You're definitely right about that.  Wow.  Is it really?  Because that's sort of, well, that's sort of, I'm going to tell you why. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to explain it to you because that's sort of your clout on this show.  Wow.  It's sort of like, here's my, here's where I am in this world.  Like, like here's how many the hosts have.  That's right.  And, and the, the staff, this is where, this is my rank.  I never bring that up.  You never bring it up, but you know that that's important to you.  It's not important.  No, that's about bullshit, Eric.  If that was important, why I'd be, why I'd be Twittering about what TV shows I watch?  No, that's bullshit.  Because you have nothing else to put on it.  You do.  You give away, you, hang on, you give away stuff on your Twitter all the time.  You don't do that as a service. 
[03:54:00]  You don't do that because you're nice.  You do that because you want people to follow you.  You give away stuff that you find in the office.  That's because you want more Twitter followers.  Yeah, no shit.  I don't want it in the office.  Because you want more Twitter followers.  And that's why you get stuff extra signed for, because you want to give it away on  your Twitter.  So you're thinking that maybe he, he wanted people that like Jim to take a picture, then  he tweeted at E-Rock Radio.  Well, because it was good that Jim wasn't here because he knew that he would at least  get one Opie tweet.  And then get a Jim tweet the next day.  And then possibly get other staff because then you gave him an Instagram tweet.  Yes, I did. 
[03:54:30]  And, uh.  You're really overthinking me.  Well, I mean, hey, it's just a theory.  I asked, I asked Sam what he thought of my theory.  Why don't you plug your Twitter?  Oh, E-Rock Radio.  There you go.  You'll get some.  Not Sam.  E-Rock Radio.  Troy Kwan.  Spelled Q-U-A-N.  Yeah.  Um, well, yeah, we got to take off.  But, uh, also, while you're online, I wanted to mention this earlier.  Maybe I'll talk about it tomorrow.  Uh, I think it was, I don't remember.  I was walking around with Opie.  I think it was a few weeks ago at this point.  But we ran into this homeless guy that just kicks things and kicks at people. 
[03:55:00]  He's a maniac.  Like, a guy, he dropped a newspaper, and this guy came up to him and said,  here, you dropped your newspaper.  And the homeless dude started kicking him.  Like, he just kicks people.  That's what he does.  He, he kicks things.  And he spits.  And people.  And he spits.  That's right, Roland.  You've seen this guy.  Yeah.  He's out all the time.  Opie took a video of him.  I don't know why he didn't bring it up on the air today.  I thought he was going to.  But you've got to see it.  It's on an Opie radio channel.  Because Opie thinks that his video camera is like a force field. 
[03:55:30]  Like a bulletproof shield.  Nothing bad can happen to him.  As long as he's got his video camera between him and this maniac.  Because he got right in the guy's face.  I was in there.  He was like, let's follow this guy.  I was like, oh, like, can't we just keep walking?  He's like, no, no, no.  We've got to get this video.  And at first, he's just in the background, like way far behind.  Then he starts running up to this guy.  And making, like, sounds right in the dude's face.  It's amazing.  It's called.  Opie's dedicated to his craft.  It's amazing, dude.  And after that, that's one of Opie's biggest strengths. 
[03:56:00]  Is that he is not afraid to get into somebody's face.  I saw one guy with a girl.  The last time he followed me, he almost slapped the girl.  It's hilarious.  It's called Homeless Lunatic on his YouTube page.  He has the same guy.  He has the same four blocks.  He won't go past that.  We'll talk about it tomorrow on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  No, but there's nothing.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.
