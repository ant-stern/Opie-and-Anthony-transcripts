<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "F.U. Friday" segment. Opie and Anthony vented about children disrupting their Long Island Railroad commute during spring break, with Opie detailing his attempts to discreetly hide Penthouse magazine from them. Anthony alluded to a significant "F.U." he couldn't publicly share due to pending litigation.  The conversation then shifted to the alarming number of livery cab driver murders and a lack of public outcry.  They briefly mentioned Whitey Ford's cancer diagnosis before pivoting to upcoming WWF events, including Stone Cold Steve Austin's return, and a hypothetical legal question regarding prize money distribution in a race with an unexpected passenger.  They promoted "WOW" stickers available at Ranch One locations and their distribution by Psycho Mark outside the Brooklyn Diner. Opie recounted a visit to an auto show, noting the cars' similarities and the novelty of an infrared camera revealing women's bodies. They also discussed the upcoming playoffs and Stone Cold's stiff performance on SmackDown.

Spaz's Week in Review followed, starting with Spaz's visible distress over a Time Out New York live read error and the exposure of his family's address.  His emotional state worsened as he revealed a $47,000 debt, partly due to loans given to others.  Callers, including Larry (who recounted a "WOW" sign incident and bear sighting) and Steve (who played a game guessing the reasons for Spaz's debt), contributed to the discussion surrounding his financial troubles.  A song mocking Spaz was also played.  This segment ended abruptly before Spaz's review concluded.

The show continued with a discussion about the hypothetical dangers of a gay scoutmaster, evolving into a debate on the nature versus nurture of sexual orientation.  Spaz asserted that people are born gay. The conversation then turned to the Ramsey family's refusal to take a lie detector test concerning JonBenét Ramsey's death, with the hosts discussing the reliability and admissibility of such tests in court.  A substantial portion focused on Spaz's highly offensive and racially charged opinions about Cubans, particularly concerning Elian Gonzalez and Cuban baseball players.  He used offensive language and stereotypes, repeatedly advocating for Elian's return to Cuba, even suggesting violent outcomes.  Numerous callers reacted to Spaz's statements, some agreeing, others vehemently disagreeing.  Ben Stein called, hanging up after taking offense to what he perceived as a coded antisemitic remark ("chew down the price," later proven to be "chew" not "Jew," by Opie).  Stein later called back, engaging in a heated exchange with the hosts.  As a solution to Spaz's debt, the hosts decided to have him wear his Boy Scout uniform and stand outside the studio with a sign saying "Insult Spaz for Five Bucks."  The segment concluded with advertisements and further discussion of the Ben Stein incident and the hosts' views on celebrities.

A phone interview with Ben Stein followed, deteriorating after Opie's use of "chew down the price," which Stein interpreted as an antisemitic slur. Stein repeatedly accused Opie of racism, despite denials.  The argument escalated, with Stein hanging up.  The hosts then played the commercial to prove Opie said "chew," not "Jew."  A smoother, though still offensive, interview with Shane McMahon followed, filled with offensive jokes about his sister, Stephanie. They discussed wrestling events, injuries, and behind-the-scenes information.   Listeners called in with opinions on the Stein interview.

The final segment began with a discussion on the etymology of "chew down," leading to more offensive jokes and ethnic slurs.  Ben Stein's outburst was mentioned.  The focus shifted to the promotion of "Wow" stickers at Ranch 1, with reports of inconsistent availability leading to accusations of a scam.  Spaz's Week in Review continued, featuring Spaz's incorrect and offensive commentary on various topics, including the prostate gland's location, Rudy Giuliani's health, and his cancer theories.  A urologist called to correct Spaz.  Other topics included George Steinbrenner's use of cancer for sympathy, a "Houdini hooker" on LSD, Darva Conger's Playboy photoshoot, and mispronunciations of Regis Philbin's name.  Numerous callers reacted to Spaz and the show's content. The show concluded with a promotion for an event where listeners could insult Spaz for $5, and a reflection on the day’s events, including an acknowledgment of offensive statements and a partial apology.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anytime I sign.  The Opie's Ant Anthony Show.  The show blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.  The Opie's Ant Anthony Show.  Blub blub blub blub blub blub.  The show blows monkey ass.  W-M-E-W.  I like that one, yeah?  It's F.U. Friday! 
[00:00:30]  I'll throw out the first F.U., Anthony.  Let it rip.  Big F.U. to all those little bastards that had the last week off for spring vacation.  Oh, is that what the problem's been?  Easter recess, whatever the hell it is.  Go back to school.  Yeah.  The Long Island Railroad's been a complete nightmare.  Mom's just bringing all their kids into the city for the day.  I hear ya.  I want to be able to read my penthouse in peace. 
[00:01:00]  On the train?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, without kids looking over your shoulder.  I gotta tell you, man.  I mean, anyone who rides a train, they can relate to this.  You find whatever it takes to get your mind off the damn train ride, you know?  You need a little entertainment.  Sometimes it's a book.  Sometimes maybe a crossword puzzle.  If you're one of those rich Fs, maybe a portable DVD player, that's what I'm dreaming of someday.  Sit on the train, watching a movie right in front of me with the headphones. 
[00:01:30]  Sure, watch a movie.  You rich Fs.  I'm jealous of ya.  So I don't have that.  Do they have outlets in the train?  No, no.  They usually have just a huge battery.  A big battery, like car batteries strapped on them or something.  But you're so tired and you're walking through the aisle and you see that guy checking out the Matrix on his DVD portable player.  Yeah.  And you're just tired.  And the guy's completely enjoying his commute home.  Yeah, got the headphones on.  Oh, I'm so jealous.  He's like totally engrossed in a movie and you're sitting there trying to thumb through your penthouse. 
[00:02:00]  Well, that's what I find, you know.  A little porno helps the ride.  A little porno helps anything, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So this morning I'm reading the latest issue of Penthouse.  Going through the whiz pictures?  No, they didn't have any whiz pictures this month.  Stop.  I was very surprised.  Come on, stop the presses.  They had a lot of lesbian stuff.  They had some weird musical thing.  The oral scene?  The oral scene.  Lots of oral scenes. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I'm reading the penthouse for him and ask Xavier or whatever her name is.  Yes.  And then this father gets on the damn train.  You know, there's a ton of kids around as is.  And he sits this kid right next to me.  Did you read to him?  No, I didn't read.  You know, I'm one of the cool guys.  I could have been an idiot and just had like, you know, cash all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  Open up the centerfold.  But instead, I'm just like reading the articles and folding over half the page so the little,  you know, kid doesn't get to see, you know, what he really wants to say. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  Because I'm just, I was paranoid.  Like, you know, they're going to throw me off the train for reading porno very close to kids.  Because they were all around me.  Yeah.  As long as you don't touch them.  Well, what am I going to do at that point, you know?  The ride sucks.  You have to be entertained.  You're right.  My, uh, my, uh, my, my, my, my, my CD Walkman, the batteries ran out, so I couldn't listen  to tunes.  So I'm just sitting there like, what do I have in my, you know, my book bag?  Oh, penthouse.  Cool.  Swank.  So, big F you to all the kids that have had the week off.  It's been a nightmare. 
[00:03:30]  They're back.  On the trains.  In the streets.  Monday.  It's just been crazy in the city.  I know.  You walk and there's just gaggles of, uh, children crossing the street.  Mm-hmm.  Big pain in the ass.  Yeah.  Gives you some nice ass to look at sometimes, occasionally.  Wow.  I, I didn't see anything on the train.  We're talking like below 10 years old.  Well, that's what I mean, Opie.  Wonderful.  Train's just loud and you just want to sleep on the way home.  Yeah.  But besides that, in a good mood, it's Friday, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  Thank goodness. 
[00:04:00]  Would you like to throw out an F you out there?  Uh, Opie, I would love to throw.  It's not a huge F you, but, uh, due to pending litigation.  Ah.  I cannot voice my F you.  Yes.  Publicly.  I can't voice it.  How's that going?  I must say.  How's that going?  It probably would have to be the hugest F you I've ever thrown out on this show ever  in my life.  Oh, just horrendous.  Will, will there be a day you'll talk about it, Anthony?  That's what everyone wants to know.  I would love to right now.  Yeah.  I would love to, but, uh, I can't because, uh, it would turn around and bite me in the ass, 
[00:04:30]  as they say.  Yes.  You know, once lawyers get involved with things, oh, it gets so ugly.  I'm for lying.  You know what I want to do?  I want to have, switch your work, uh, switch your employment for a day.  I want to switch livery cab drivers with lawyers for a day.  So, and, and send them all to the Bronx and East New York and Brooklyn and, and just have  them get gunned down.  Mm-hmm.  Rigging lawyers.  I could, I could solve the whole livery cab problem, by the way. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Partitions, idiots.  Well, they did that with the, uh, yellow cabs.  It seems to have worked.  Partitions.  Hello.  Your brothers are being killed every day now.  Partitions.  You want a little dose of honesty?  You'll find it here on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what, uh, you know why there's so many getting killed?  Mm.  No one cares.  No one cares about these guys.  I swear to God, if, if this many Wall Street brokers were getting gunned down on an almost 
[00:05:30]  daily basis down on Wall Street, there'd be a dragnet over the city.  It would be a police state.  They would, uh, send the National Guard in.  But it's, I thought, why?  Now the, the Pakistani gets blown away in his livery cab?  No one cares.  Yeah.  That's the bottom line.  No one cares.  How stupid do you have to be to drive a livery cab into these horrible neighborhoods without  a partition at this point?  But if you don't, if you deny the ride, then you get in trouble.  Then get another job.  It's not worth your life.  Look at where all these things are taking place.  The Bronx and, uh, the really nasty portions of Brooklyn. 
[00:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  Who do you think's doing this?  Hmm.  Hmm.  I'll just leave it to the listener's imagination.  Well, they're, they're yelling out the answer in their cars.  Thank you.  Yes.  I heard you all the way over here.  Yes.  Very, very good.  Okay.  Uh, yeah, I know.  Yesterday was take a kid to work day.  That's why a lot of kids yesterday.  Oh, I thought it was touch a kid at work day.  Oh, see?  No wonder I'm in trouble.  All right, Anthony, we got to take our first break. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whitey Ford came down with cancer now, too.  Another ex-Yankee.  Oh, my God.  Spaz must just be in his glory.  No one will be making fun of Whitey Ford on this show today.  Where's the angry Met fan, Ben?  Whitey, Whitey Ford's a friend of my dad's.  Is he?  Yeah, they've done some business together in the past.  He's a really, really nice guy.  I've caddied for him, too.  Caddy?  You've caddied for him?  Yes, I have.  The important thing is winning that caddy tournament.  My only other radio, my only other job, I should say.  Look, it's Whitey Ford. 
[00:07:00]  Whitey, Whitey, Whitey Ford.  He's a very good guy.  He's had a lot of tragedy in his life lately, too, so.  Hey, Whitey.  All right, if anyone else wants, you know, if anyone else wants to, you know, make fun of him,  you're more than welcome.  I'm just saying that I will be.  Whitey.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, we have lots to do today.  Yes.  We have Spaz's Week in Review. 
[00:07:30]  We're going to have to get into that very soon because we've got Shane McMahon calling in.  We've got Ben Stein calling in.  Oh, yeah, Shane O'Mac.  Shane O'Mac.  We'll talk about the WWF and Stone Cold making his reappearance at SmackDown last night.  I've got a thought on the top of my head.  I want to throw out and maybe get your opinion on it.  Yeah.  I'm not into auto racing or anything.  But let's just say Dale Earnhardt, I guess everybody knows who that is, stock car driver.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say he's going to run the Daytona 500, right? 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  Uh, and then at the starting line, uh, some chick jumps in his car.  Just jumps in.  Okay.  Doesn't do anything.  Just sits there in the passenger seat.  All right.  Dale's racing around the track.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, Dale wins.  Dale wins the race.  Sure.  How much of that prize money is the person entitled to that jumped in the car?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
[00:08:30]  And what would this person be doing, let's say, if she didn't jump in the car? 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  Tendon bar?  I don't know.  I have no clue.  But, you know, I think Dale is doing the driving.  You know, a couple of times the person speaks up and almost derailed Dale.  Dale persevered, though, and crossed the finish line.  Wow.  I just want to know.  Sometimes Dale had to go home early because someone couldn't stand up anymore. 
[00:09:30]  What, the person that jumped in Dale's car?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's interesting.  Yeah, very interesting.  But much to the astonishment, Dale actually crossed the finish line and won.  Right.  I just want to know.  The interesting thing, too, about that, I believe Dale's record of winning a lot of races since that girl stopped jumping in the car is quite good.  Yeah, yeah.  Dale's on top. 
[00:10:00]  Won more races than ever.  Mm-hmm.  I just want to know, you know, if that person, how much of the prize money for winning the race that that person that just jumped in the car at the starting line is entitled to.  Hmm.  Oh, I get it.  What?  We're talking auto racing here, right?  Yes, we are.  Dale Earnhardt.  Number three.  This has nothing to do with going to your lawyer today, does it?  No, not at all.  I'm talking about Dale Earnhardt.  Okay. 
[00:10:30]  And just race car driver, NASCAR, number three.  Just want to make sure.  Big bad Dale.  Just want to make sure.  Okay.  I'm just wondering.  It just struck me that for some reason that thought popped in my head.  That might be a question for a lawyer.  Too bad the lawyers aren't on the track when you're going around.  Dale Earnhardt.  All right, Anthony, let's take a break, okay?  All right-o.  All right, and we'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Oh, the WOW stickers. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, we got some great info about the WOW stickers.  We'll tell you guys that next.  Stay there.  The LP and Anthony Show.  The start track of this year.  1-0-2-7-W-N-A-W.  It's the ONH Show.  It's FU Friday.  It's the ONH Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Our fax line, that's the best way to get through with the FUs.  2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, I hate getting in like this late because I haven't eaten my lunch yet.  I come running in here.  Let's just say I was visiting my pit crew.  Your pit crew.  Okay.  Do you have a pit crew?  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  I got a pit crew.  Trying to keep the car in working order, make sure I have enough tires to finish the race.  Gas to still compete.  Gas, very expensive.  Yes.  Well, Anthony, the answer to your question was half, by the way. 
[00:12:00]  No matter what.  No matter what, yes.  Thank you.  Even though this person is just sitting there doing nothing, the answer is half the price money.  Dale Earnhardt's car.  Yes.  Okay.  Anthony, this just announced today, Pearl Jam.  They're coming to Jones Beach August 23rd and 24th.  Tickets will go on sale May 5th for those shows, okay?  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam on the rock of New York.  New York's new rock alternative. 
[00:12:30]  Alternative.  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  In other concert news, Dio, tomorrow night, Irving Plaza.  The best was Dio on South Park.  Yeah.  That's why I mentioned Dio's like cool again, you know?  Dio.  Animated Dio on South Park.  Yeah.  South Park making a lot of people cool again.  Yeah.  And Mighty Mighty Boss Jones play Monday at the Bowery Ballroom.  That should be a good show as well, Anthony.  Okay, let's get into the WOW stickers. 
[00:13:00]  A ton of information came through today, which is very, very cool.  We could finally announce this one.  WOW stickers now available at participating Ranch One locations, Anthony.  Yeah.  All you have to do is find a Ranch One store nearest you, walk in and say, hey, I'm here  for the Opie and Anthony WOW sticker.  They have them at all the stores.  Cool.  All right?  That's going to help us out because the Ranch One is all over the damn place.  So please pick up your WOW stickers at the Ranch One stores, okay? 
[00:13:30]  I don't think they just have them out because they know our listeners where you guys will  take $200 for yourself.  So I believe you have to ask someone behind the counter.  They got it right there near the register or something.  They'll hand you some, okay?  Uh-huh.  If you can't get to a Ranch One, you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Wow.  You should see the envelopes coming in.  It's like fan mail for some, like, teeny bopper or something.  Fan mail from some flounder?  It's like fan mail for, like, David Cassidy or something.  They're starting to bring in the self-addressed envelopes and the big bags and stuff. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Rock.  We finally found something for Earl to do.  What?  Am I lying?  Oh, no.  I'm not laughing at anything, too.  That's not a joke.  We finally found something for Earl to do.  Earl sits there.  On his desk, we just pour the self-addressed stamped envelopes like this at.  Spills all out over his desk, and then he has to, you know, mail out the WOW stickers  to everybody.  Yeah.  So, if you want to send in a self-addressed stamped envelope and keep Earl busy, send big 
[00:14:30]  envelopes, not small ones.  Well, the regular-sized envelopes we found out today work.  Do they?  Yeah, I was a little worried about that.  Yeah.  I did a little test to make sure, because these stickers are definitely a little bigger than  a regular bumper sticker, Anthony.  Anyway, the self-addressed stamped envelope, send it to WNW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th Floor,  New York, New York, 10106, and just write a tension WOW sticker or something like that  on there, okay?  Cool.  And that address, I believe, is available through the WNW website and foundrymusic.com. 
[00:15:00]  Also, one more thing with the WOW stickers.  If you want to pick one up before you go home today and you're near the station, our buddy,  our pal Psycho Mark will be outside, once again, in front of the building, in front of the  Brooklyn Diner with WOW stickers at 5 o'clock today, Anthony.  Okay.  Last time we did this, a couple days ago, we gave out, like, 1,500 within, like, a half  hour.  It was crazy.  Psycho Mark, believe it or not, he has work to do today.  But at 5 o'clock, he'll be out there with the brand-new WOW stickers, 57th and 7th, 
[00:15:30]  outside the Brooklyn Diner, okay?  What's he doing?  Tell your kids not to do drugs.  I highly recommend that you get your ass, I highly recommend you get your ass, outside  the Brooklyn Diner, because this was just handed to me, Earl can only do six envelopes  in eight hours, so.  Yeah.  A little inside joke, if you know the show.  Very good.  Okay.  So, I hope I went to the auto show at the Javits Center last night. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Nothing really blew me away, the cars.  They kind of all look the same.  These days, you go from one section to another, you know, Pontiac, and then Nissan, and all  the cars, they all look the same.  I don't really like them.  They had the concept cars, the ones of the future.  Those cars never come out.  They never, yeah, they've been doing the concept cars at the car shows for like 20 years.  I've never seen one of them out on the street.  I think the goal for the future is to make the most inconvenient car door as is humanly 
[00:16:30]  possible.  There was one, I swear to God, it had these hydraulic things that lifted it up like a  gull wing on a Lamborghini or something.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  But first it came out and then went, I can't even describe it, but if you're parked under  a tree or next to a tree or anything, you'll have this really cool looking car that you'll  have to crawl out of.  Like you need clearance to five feet on each side to open your doors.  You ever been in a parking lot where you got to just squeak out of your door? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You'd never get out.  No.  And the concept cars all look like the 50s version of the future.  It's like Disneyland's future land.  Tomorrowland, that's what they look like.  Yeah.  Just horrible.  And do we need a concept minivan?  Like it's cool kind of when you have the concept Jaguar or something.  You know, this thing's going to do 600 miles an hour, almost break the sound barrier.  It's really cool looking.  Well, the companies that are making the minivans, which is pretty much every one, they understand 
[00:17:30]  that it's not, it doesn't have the coolest wrap.  Yeah.  So they're trying to make it cool by coming up with exotic names and...  The Talon.  Yeah.  It's a minivan.  Please.  Yeah.  And then there was one minivan with, in the back, a microwave oven, a washer and dryer,  this little washer and dryer thing, a vacuum cleaner, and it was totally set up for like  the mom to take her kids around.  So she could cart along her work with her.  Yeah.  Like she has time for that. 
[00:18:00]  To do the wash.  On the road.  As she's doing that.  The most exciting thing that I saw was in Cadillac.  They have that infrared little heads-up display on the windshield.  So if you're driving at night, you have your headlights, you see what's going on.  But they also have infrared, so you look at the little heads-up display on your windshield  and you could see, just like it was daylight, out the front of the car.  Well, they had a huge screen set up with this infrared imaging technology. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  With a camera there.  I know what you're going at.  Stood by there for like a half hour.  Oh, this is the best thing at the auto show.  The girls walk by and it looks like they're naked.  This is the sole reason to buy one of these caddies.  You'd be almost running girls over because you want to point your car at them.  You're brilliant.  You even find nudity at a car show.  I love it.  Dude, I swear to God, this one girl walks by.  She's wearing this tight black shirt. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God, she's naked.  The infrared goes right through this stuff to the point where you see boobs.  That rocks.  Something to think about if you're going to the car show this weekend, I guess, huh?  Yeah, but you also got to put up with the rubes that are there.  Oh, do you need to take a camcorder to a car show?  Those are our listeners.  No, no, no.  Believe me, they're not.  No.  These people, I mean, I can understand you take your nice camera, whatever it is, and 
[00:19:30]  you snap some pictures of the cars you like.  Who's going to sit, hey, guys, come on over, couple of beers and the video of the car show?  Oh, well, I'll be right over.  All right, hey, look, here's the new Buick spinning around.  I got one complete rotation of it spinning on its own turntable.  Just sit there.  It's great.  Wait till you see the back of this thing.  Hey, why didn't you just walk around it real quick instead of waiting for it to rotate?  Bunch of dweebs. 
[00:20:00]  And then you can tell just like the people that are there, really can't swing the Jaguar.  I mean, who the hell can?  These cars are like $100,000.  Sometimes you got these guys, look, I'm in the Jaguar.  The Jaguar.  Look, Ma.  Take a picture of me in the Jaguar.  I'm on need this one.  Yeah.  And then there's the cars that, you know, just the Hispanics are gathering around like  the new Celica.  They got the tires that look like just rims with a rubber band around it.  That's the tire.  This little thing. 
[00:20:30]  It's like two feet off the ground.  And they're already like you listen to them.  It's like, man, I can put the blue neon lights underneath this thing.  I'll get the red blinking light that goes around the license plate.  I'll put the Jesus Christ headlight stencils on.  The crown air freshener.  Hey, does this come with a little chain steering wheel that's as big as a quarter?  It was interesting.  That sounds like a car show down at the Jabbits Center.  Like I said, though, the highlight, though, the Cadillac thing. 
[00:21:00]  Go to the Cadillac thing, the infrared.  Yeah.  Check out Girls Naked, right?  Unbelievable.  All right.  I had a boring night.  I went home and watched lots of basketball.  Oh, you've got to get out, my friend.  No, man.  It's the playoffs.  Can't do anything until the playoffs are over.  Yeah.  Even, you know, God forbid the Knicks don't make it all the way.  I'll watch every single game that is put in front of me.  But I also watched SmackDown.  How was that?  I missed that.  Well, they teased all night long that Stone Cold Steve Austin was going to be at SmackDown Live. 
[00:21:30]  Stone Cold, yeah.  So at 9.56, he finally shows up.  Now, I hate when they do that.  I understand why they do that.  We do that on this show sometimes, tease things.  But they tease this thing.  My dog, King.  We're going to have Stone Cold Steve Austin going to come in here.  Right.  He was teasing them.  At one point, Shane McMahon, you know, punched a cardboard cutout of Stone Cold.  He thought it was the real Stone Cold.  That was pretty funny.  And then, you know, there's a rattlesnake left on the couch. 
[00:22:00]  Ah, yeah.  And a few other things, whatever.  We don't need to get into all of it.  But finally, he shows up at, like, 9.56-ish.  Yeah.  And he destroyed the DX, like, you know, motorhome thing.  Yeah, the DX bus, yeah.  But Stone Cold, in general, it's great to see him back.  His energy just is unbelievable.  Yeah.  They need that in the WWF these days.  But, man, he just still looks like there's no way he could really do much of anything.  Really stiff.  He looked really stiff and, yeah, just really very awkward. 
[00:22:30]  Spin me around.  I can't see him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks like, remember that episode of The Little Rascals where the one kid couldn't  turn his head?  Mm-hmm.  And then Stimey finally grabbed it and went, ah!  Spunned around.  That's what he needs.  Yeah.  So I don't see him doing much during the pay-per-view Sunday, but it'll still be exciting.  Yeah.  Yeah, so.  Stone Cold Gimp.  Aw, come on.  I'm the Gimp.  Well, we have Shane McMahon calling in in about an hour, hour and a half or so. 
[00:23:00]  All right, we'll talk to him about Stone Cold and other things.  Got to take a quick break, Anthony.  We're a few minutes away from Spaz's Week in Review.  Oh, I got to finish my salami sandwich.  Yeah, you better hurry up and eat because you're going to puke it up.  We took a break from Spaz's Week in Review last week, so a lot of people looking forward  to it today.  Oh, I'm sure.  That and other things to get to.  If you want to get in on the show, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, or you can fax us with the FUs.  We like the FUs on Friday.  Let off a little steam.  Fax line, 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9. 
[00:23:30]  Gelfi and Anthony Show.  I think that might be part of the problem with society tonight.  Oh, I believe we're the problem.  Gelfi, you stupid bitch.  Get down.  1-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, time out New York.  Weekend upon us.  A lot of people looking for things to do.  I do believe time out New York would be the perfect thing to pick up to see what's going  on, right?  Well, they are called the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  Yeah.  In New York, you don't know what to do. 
[00:24:00]  You're hanging out with your friends going, what do we do?  I don't know.  What do we do?  I don't know.  And you wind up spending the night at some bar in some theme restaurant with some rubes  from Oklahoma.  That's not what you came to New York for.  Time out New York.  Everything to do in New York.  All the cool, fun, hip stuff.  None of the Oklahoma rube stuff to do.  They got everything.  There are people that live on Long Island that come in just to go to, like, Planet Hollywood. 
[00:24:30]  Stupid.  There's so much cool thing, so many things to do in this city.  A lot of people don't know.  They just know the well-publicized things.  Well, they go to the Times Square, you know, from Jersey or something, and they go to, like, TGIF.  It's like, don't you have one of those in your town?  Well, that's why you should pick up Time Out New York.  30 things that excite the palates of Time Out New York's food critics, including the best use of an ice pick. 
[00:25:00]  Interesting.  Best dessert your own Jewish grandma never made.  Best reason to be bridge and tunnel.  Anthony, yes?  You got the wrong script.  I do?  Yeah.  Script for April 19th, 22nd.  Well, I'm just going to read it anyway.  And the best place to watch a sports game without having to eat wings.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  So if you come across the last issue of Time Out New York, you'll read all that.  Well, the newest...  If you come across this issue, Opie, tell them what they'll read while I get ready to punch somebody in the effing face. 
[00:25:30]  Well, they were too busy yelling and arguing about Kevin's address and his last name being on the air.  And I'm like, hello, we've got a radio show to do here.  No, let's worry about Kevin's last name for another day.  Okay.  Well, anyway...  Someone else can do it.  The latest Time Out New York, where to take your two-wheeler for a springtime spin, Anthony?  Yes.  We were talking about that.  Mm-hmm.  And just like you said, tons and tons of things to do in New York City.  It's Time Out New York.  It's on every newsstand. 
[00:26:00]  It is a great, great guide if you're looking for something to do in the city, okay?  Right.  Time Out New York.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine steak.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  W-N-E-W.  It's Friday!  Friday! 
[00:26:30]  Friday!  Ah, yes.  It sure is.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Lots and lots of things going on.  We've got to get spazzing here.  It's time for Spaz's Week in Review.  Nice.  I look forward to this.  Larry, what's going on?  What up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I'm working up in Butler, New Jersey.  Channel 2 News is up here because there's a big black bear in a tree.  So I busted out my wow sign, went charging up to David Diaz, and I got gaffled by the cop. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So they escorted me out of the area, ripped up my wow sign, went back to my van, got my other wow sign, took off my sweatshirt hat, took out my earrings, tried it again, but the one cop recognized me, threw me out, said he was a huge fan.  He would love to let me get on TV, but there's nothing he could do about it.  Yeah, I got to agree with the guy.  He's got to do his job.  That's why he's got to be a little more incognito, covert. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, they were saying they were afraid if the bear got out of the tree that I would be distracting people, and the bear might attack the people I would distract.  All right, wait.  There's a bear in a tree where?  In the middle of this town of Butler.  It's going to be on Channel 2 News probably around 5 o'clock.  Hmm.  There you go.  All right.  Well, I'm sure someone will get the job done.  Wouldn't it be funny if the guy turned down and ate David Diaz's head right off his body?  I'm here with the giant...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Just like lays into his throat. 
[00:28:00]  You better not send any of those reporters with those fake hair pieces.  They're going to think it's a raccoon and attack you.  Or maybe a mate.  Yeah, they might mate with your head.  And the old horse.  All right, Larry.  Yo, thanks a lot, guys.  You guys rule.  Syndication, whatever.  Well, thank you for trying to get that wow on TV.  I'll try again.  Later.  That has slowed down drastically lately, and this is the time of year we want the wow  all over TV.  Yes.  It drives the TV stations crazy, Anthony.  They hate it.  We love it.  And if you need a wow sticker, the brand new wow stickers came in this week. 
[00:28:30]  Now they're starting to get spread all over the tri-state area.  We just announced this a little while ago.  Wow stickers now available at Ranch One locations.  Yes.  And Ranch One is all over the place.  Find the one closest to you right now.  Go in and say, hey, I'm here for the wow sticker.  They will give you one.  They will give you one.  They're not out on the counter because they know you guys will take like a couple hundred  each and stuff.  So, you know, just ask the person behind the counter nicely, and they'll give you the stickers.  Okay?  Pulling out of the parking garage.  I look to the right.  Stuck on a pole. 
[00:29:00]  I know.  You see that?  Wow.  I haven't seen any on the cars yet, but it's still too early.  Yeah, it is.  We're just starting to get them out there.  At 5 o'clock today, Psycho Mark will be outside the building once again today.  Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, with a ton of wow stickers so you can get that.  But you get your sticker before you head home for the weekend, okay?  Okay.  Well, let's get spaz.  Let's do the spaz week in review.  Spaz week in review.  I love it. 
[00:29:30]  I so look forward to this on a weekly basis, and I don't know why.  It's torture.  It is torture to get through.  Hello, spaz.  Hi.  You got your headphones?  I don't even have a head.  Why do I need phones for them?  All right.  I can play this while we get him situated.  Dude, politics and stuff.  He's as dumb as the boss of rock. 
[00:30:00]  His lips are macking when he tries to talk.  This is it, though.  We can review it fast.  You dumb f***.  I love that.  Hey, dog.  Where's your brother's song, too?  That's funny.  Spaz is in a pissy-ass mood today.  Hey, everybody is, though.  Have you noticed this?  Everyone's just a tad cranky today.  Well, we've had a really long week, to be honest with you.  Spaz is totally friggin' livid.  We've had a long, long week. 
[00:30:30]  A lot of excitement.  Spaz, what's the problem?  What's the matter, man?  You look all bummed.  This is a fun show.  Oh, God.  What's the matter, Spaz?  You okay?  Pull the mic up by your face.  I didn't particularly like that comment during the live reads.  Which one?  The one about, you didn't have to mention that, that part.  It's a legitimate gripe on my part.  Yeah, so everything is game on the show, man.  Instead of you guys getting your job done, we're doing a live read for Time Out New York that was three weeks old. 
[00:31:00]  And I'm sitting there going, hey, where's the Time Out New York read?  And you guys are like, you're yelling at Rick about, you know, us putting your last name on the air.  Get over it.  It's done.  It's over with.  It's not that.  It's I just got a call where somebody gave me my address verbatim of my family.  Well, that's smart to admit on the radio.  And I, our last names are in the paper every other week.  There's nothing you can do about it. 
[00:31:30]  That's right.  But I think we had a legitimate gripe that we had the wrong copy in front of us.  You know, it's not too fun to be reading a commercial and realize I'm reading about the Hindenburg disaster as if it's current news.  Time Out New York spends a lot of money for these live reads.  We're reading the wrong copy.  And all you care about is that your last name was on the radio.  I only saw that.  If you don't want to be a part of the show, you don't want to be famous anymore, just walk.  And then no one will know your last name. 
[00:32:00]  It's part of the job, unfortunately.  Okay.  So I'm learning that now.  Our last names have been all over the place.  My dad gets bothered.  They found out where he lived.  What are you going to do about it?  There's not much you can do about it.  It's part of the price.  Those are the only two reads I saw.  Well, whatever.  That's done.  But I want to thank the fine folks of Time Out New York for putting up with that crap.  Yes.  Read their expose on Mayor Lindsay.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:32:30]  No, that's an old copy, too.  It's the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  It's on newsstands now.  I'm looking for something to do this weekend.  Pick it up.  All right?  All right.  You'll find a lot of things to do.  It's Time Out New York.  Okay.  Spaz, you ready for Spaz's Week in Review?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  How are we going to do this?  Do you want to go home?  He is totally, like, effed up.  Spaz, are you okay?  Do you want to go home?  No.  Do you want to take a day off?  No. 
[00:33:00]  You need something?  I'm just going through a lot of things.  Do you want a bottle?  Do you want a whoopee?  Take a nappy?  Do you need a whoopee?  I'm not a little kid.  Do you want to take your little square rug and go take a nappy somewhere for a while?  I'm not a little kid.  I can like it.  Go to your cubby hole and get your little rug, Matt.  All right.  Why are you looking at Psycho Mark like you want to punch him?  What did he do to you? 
[00:33:30]  Just go around with him, Zach, man.  Spaz.  Do you want a martini or something?  Usually fun after a couple of drinks.  What's the problem, man?  There's something deeper, obviously.  So what is it?  There's nothing deep at all.  It's just been, like you said, it's been a long week.  All right.  I will promise you that I will not say your last name anymore because I don't really need to.  I don't care.  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh? 
[00:34:00]  No.  It came up and it's out there.  It's too late.  But I will not mention it again, okay?  There's a lot of other things.  It's minute.  What else?  What else is bothering you, Spaz?  I can't.  No.  I'm not going to go through it.  You cheated on Eric again and wrote it on your calendar?  Don't even go there.  Well, I'm just asking.  I'm trying to help you out.  You want to be closer?  This is what a friend does.  No.  They see that their pals are in a bad mood.  They ain't knew I was in a bad mood today.  We talked a little.  So let's talk, Spaz.  Just going through the stress. 
[00:34:30]  Okay, what's the problem?  Just going through the stresses of moving.  Stresses of moving?  From one cardboard box to another?  How hard could that be?  Spaz, let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  Mark, show me that now.  We are going.  No, I'm not showing you.  Psycho Mark is holding up a sign, Spaz.  What's it say?  It says the AIDS test just came back.  Oh, my God.  If you want to beat him up, I give you permission.  Get the boxing gloves.  Get the boxing gloves.  Why are you going to box me?  What did I do? 
[00:35:00]  Out live in the studio.  You're having fun, Spaz.  We're just having a little fun.  Spaz, let me just say something to you.  Because you are here and you learn about radio by doing these things and stuff.  There's other things that I think I can help you out with.  Finally, there's something I can help you out with.  When you have some kind of an issue weighing on you, and you're here to do the show.  Keep it outside.  You got it.  Well, no, no, no.  Because we do discuss.  Yeah, I've changed my philosophy on that.  I learned that in college, and it's a bunch of BS. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  They say, wow, if you're having problems, you should leave it outside the studio door and go on with the show.  But in our case, no.  There's two things you do.  You act like nothing's wrong, so we don't bring it up.  Or if we notice there's something wrong with you, then you have to explain yourself.  That's it.  So the stresses of moving.  Yes.  How hard could that be?  None of these places are calling me back.  Are the bill collectors calling you yet? 
[00:36:00]  Isn't that credit card?  I owe a lot more than a credit card.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Did you chalk up more?  No.  I have the credit card bill.  I also have 47 grand in loans.  From the Iona College.  No, it's only 27 of it.  47,000?  What's the other?  Where's the other fund?  No, 47,000.  Oh, my God.  I know what it is.  Is this a spaz intervention? 
[00:36:30]  Wait a minute.  From Iona is only half that?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And what's the other half?  It's just loans I need taken out throughout the years that I needed.  You took loans out?  Yeah.  You owe $47,000?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We need a telethon for this guy.  A spaz-a-thon.  Take on the credit card and bills.  There are guys that make you owe that much, and you got a credit card anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's a moment. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, that's it.  Blow the load, man.  Just go to town.  You owe $47,000?  I haven't made a payment yet.  Oh, my God.  What the hell did you buy?  And it's collecting interest, isn't it?  Yeah.  What the hell did you buy with $47,000?  A couple of dollars?  Yeah.  No, it's nothing you want to get into.  Nothing you want to get into.  There's your education was $27,000 of that.  And then another $20,000 is, I could say, it's personal, right? 
[00:37:30]  It's very personal.  Very personal.  Very personal.  Okay.  All right.  That's fine.  He's in a weird situation.  I'm just going to get punched by Spaz.  I got him laughing.  He's smiling.  He's in a weird...  He's in a weird...  He's in a weird...  He's in a weird...  He's in a weird...  He's in a weird...  He calls up and says, hookers.  Jesus Christ.  He talks about...  He talks about hookers in his Week in Review.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, you know something...  I could speak for Spaz.  There's a lot of money that he has lent out that I think he has no choice, right? 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  You're trying to help someone out, and you're in a weird position.  Well, the thing, when you're in that situation, isn't to go out and get another $4,000 credit card, or $5,000, whatever it was.  So, I'd never had one.  I always wanted one.  Wait.  So, did you go out and get a loan to give money to other people?  Yeah.  Because you don't have $47,000 in the bank, and you blew through.  Every day, I'm trying to work out how I'm going to pay off these things, but my income is less than my outcome. 
[00:38:30]  Why did the person...  That's basic economics.  Yeah.  You've got to make more than you spend.  Yeah.  It's a basic rule.  So, why did the person that you sent all his money to allow you to put yourself in this bad position?  Because the person is close to you.  Yeah.  That's the only reason why.  Oh.  Are you sponsoring children in Africa?  Is that what it is?  That's exactly it.  65 cents a day, and you're sponsoring an entire continent. 
[00:39:00]  Starving me.  Starving me.  I'm supporting an Afro-American.  An Afro.  An Afro-American.  The African-Americans in Africa.  All right, listen.  An Afro-American in Africa.  All right, so now you're in some massive debt, my friend.  He's in massive debt.  Massive.  Can't really talk about it on the air.  I know what he's going through.  I'm trying to make it so we can talk about it on the air.  He's just been put in a bad situation is what it is. 
[00:39:30]  Right?  Is it similar to something that maybe somebody else on the show has had to deal with?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Safe to say.  Yes.  Interesting.  Someone very close to him.  I understand.  Just leave it at that.  That's a pretty intense situation to be putting your, well, a young man in.  Yes.  The person that you have been helping out should understand the pressure this is putting on you. 
[00:40:00]  Yes, she does.  Oh, interesting.  How old is this debt?  How old is it?  Yeah, how old is not that old?  It's the 20,000.  The 20,000.  Less than a year, right?  Yeah, well, it's coming up on the air, yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I'm surprised I keep getting approved.  Dude, stop being low.  Dude, they will approve you right into bankruptcy.  They'll approve until they come to your house and take the shirt off your bag. 
[00:40:30]  They don't care.  You're going to have to file bankruptcy before you're 25.  It's going to be great.  But I heard about that.  If you file for bankruptcy, your debtor's wife claims.  Oh, yeah.  You know something?  Along with your credit rating, any chance of getting any credit to even rent a frigging car,  yeah, you can file for bankruptcy, but they've got to go through everything.  It's a big pain in the ass.  Because they will still try to get as much money as they can.  Yeah, I know a few people that filed for bankruptcy, and from what I heard, it's really no fun. 
[00:41:00]  It's not like, oh, you ring it up, and then, hey, tab's clear.  I start over again.  Where's my new visa?  You know?  It's not like that.  When was the last time you took out a loan?  How long ago?  How long ago?  Three months.  Three months ago?  Yeah.  And how much was that for?  Where are you getting these loans?  From banks?  From one bank.  You go into a bank and say, I need a loan.  The bank you work for on the weekends?  Yeah.  Holy cow.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Oh, my God.  Stupid! 
[00:41:30]  You're so stupid!  Why is that bad?  Spaz, you can't, because you can't afford it.  I mean, you can't, you really can't afford it.  It's not like kind of overstepping your boundaries and going over your limit like all of us do  and have at some point in our lives.  You are blowing the load.  You're really going for it.  Could we borrow 50 bucks?  Wow.  Now, is this a...  Oh, my God.  What?  Is this person...  Spaz, is this person a relative? 
[00:42:00]  I've got to ask you.  I don't want to go deeper into it.  Because that's all...  It could be any...  It could be a third cousin.  I'm just saying, is it a relative of yours?  This is legal is what we said.  I don't want to go into it anymore.  Someone very close to him, man.  That's a relative.  Oh, my God.  She's putting you in a bad situation.  It's all right.  You're trying to help this person out, and in turn, she's making your life a living hell.  It's okay. 
[00:42:30]  Worse than her situation was...  What?  It's all right.  This is...  All right.  Oh, my God.  Spaz.  You shouldn't have that type of pressure at 23 years old.  22?  23.  23.  All right.  Listen.  Let's say you were Dale Earnhardt, and you're driving in a car.  Is it the pit crew taking your money?  Is it...  Kidding, of course.  All right.  Listen.  Now we've got to take a break.  We've got to get you happy, because we're doing your weekend review.  Yeah.  Get some booze in this kit. 
[00:43:00]  What do you want to do?  Do you want to run up and down the stairs a couple times, get your energy up, go in the  office, do a shot?  We've got some...  What do we got?  Vodka back there.  Some JD.  Some beers.  Full bar back in the office.  Do you want to take a stack or two, maybe?  Get a boost of energy?  A shot sounds nice.  A shot sounds nice.  You need some X?  Okay.  You need maybe some heroin in the eye or something?  I never do drugs.  We've got it all back there.  It's a good time to start.  Debt is a great thing if you're on drugs.  See, if you're on drugs, you really don't care.  All right, Spaz, go down the hall. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Get ready, because we're going to do Spaz's Week in Review next, okay?  Pump him full of some liquor there, Ben.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  We are the Red O.P. and Anthony Show.  I like it when the show is dirty.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, Spaz is in the dressing room.  Getting ready for the show, if you know what I mean. 
[00:44:00]  Spaz's Week in Review right around the corner.  Believe it or not, I feel bad for him today.  Can't lie.  Larry, what's up?  Dude, listen, I can understand everything that's going on there today.  The only thing I can't understand, they let him work in a bank?  Are you serious?  They say he's their best worker.  You know what?  He sounds like such a wuss today.  Well.  I could just picture him on the beach with his mother,  and his mother saying, Spaz, do you feel fresh today? 
[00:44:30]  You know?  Yeah, I don't know.  The guy definitely has $47,000 of debt to deal with.  Right.  That would scare any of us.  No, I hear that.  You know, listen, you've got to help somebody.  You've got to help somebody.  But take care of it like a man.  Yeah, well, it's Spaz, so.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Go, oh, you should go rob a bank, man.  Like the one you work at.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  There you go, Spaz.  Poor Spaz is right. 
[00:45:00]  Is he ready?  Because we want to do this week in review here.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I want to play a game.  What do you want to play?  Well, let's play guess what Spaz did to get himself in his family.  All right.  All right.  You've got to hang up after you dump.  It's the only way it works.  Actually, before I dumped out Spaz, someone kind of figured it out.  I put it up.  Puked.  What?  You put it?  I took the shot and I put it up. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, my God.  What did you just have?  Vodka.  And I chased it down with a beer and just my whole McDonald's lunch came out.  Oh, my God.  This is disturbing.  There's an advertisement for you.  Oh, you're not, like, puking your nose now and everything, do you?  It was just dripping out.  You feeling better?  Are you feeling better? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, now that I got that out of my system.  You want us to get you a tomato or something?  Are you good?  I swore off tomatoes.  Oh, you're like, did you get any of the booze in you?  Yeah, it went in, but it came right back out.  Spaz, I know we're going to spend the next, like, half hour abusing you, but before we do,  I'm going to tell you, I feel bad for you today.  I feel a little sorry for you.  Even after yesterday's phone thing?  I explained what went on off the air and we settled it. 
[00:46:30]  You do a fine job for us.  Don't worry about it.  Thank you.  Eddie wants to know if Opie can give Spaz a valium.  Can you spare one of your drugs, Hope?  Yeah, I can.  Good.  So, because there's nothing like booze and pills.  Take care of your problems, Spaz.  Learn it young.  That's right.  Where's the Spaz song so we can get into the Spaz Week in Review?  All right, we're finally ready, Anthony.  A little ditty from your brother and your sister. 
[00:47:00]  Stupid child of Spaz, a nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he caused.  Mind the phone with brain damage and thought process of pause.  He is stupid child of Spaz, a nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty.  Callin' Kevin can't go Spaz when he picks up the phone.  Don't expect an answer, cause his brain cells are all blown.  How do you get this job without one?  Hey, well, I don't know.  He's the biggest nerd you ever heard on New York radio.  Hey, stupid child of Spaz, a nitwit, and he makes me nauseous. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he caused.  Hey, man, the phone with brain damage and thought process of pause.  Whoa!  Stupid child of Spaz, a nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty.  Whoa!  Dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty.  Whoa!  Dumb little ditty, dumb little ditty.  Whoa!  Spaz is...  Spaz is week in review.  Whoa!  It is now time for the K-Daw week in reveal. 
[00:48:00]  And let's just get right into the news.  National news.  What's going on?  The high court, which is the Supreme Court, they call it the high court as well,  is weighing the Boy Scouts ban on gays.  Apparently, there's some big fuss about a gay scout leader.  And I, myself, am a registered Boy Scout.  I am an assistant scout master.  And I went through all the ranks.  And my personal opinion on this is that if the guy doesn't hit on the little kids, 
[00:48:30]  because just because you're termed gay does not mean you're going to be a pedophile  and go after kids who are under 18 years of age, which is being a pedophile.  So that doesn't mean that they're going to be going after the little boys.  It just means that they're gay, and that's your sexual preference.  It's just another...  Now, I, myself, am not gay.  Let's just get that out on the table now.  And I could be friends with somebody who's gay,  but I just don't want that person to be hitting on me.  Have sex with them.  I just let them know, or I have to bet, listen, I'll be your friend, dude. 
[00:49:00]  But listen, or you could be my scout master, man.  And listen, you could just be my scout master, and I don't care if you're gay.  So I don't think it should matter.  Unless he actually physically does something, then be tossed out.  You're only speculating that he'll do something.  He hasn't actually done anything yet.  So the Supreme Court is weighing this decision,  and I think that they should keep that in account in their minds  when they're trying to make that decision.  Now moving on.  Wow.  Boy, there's a surprising turn, though. 
[00:49:30]  I'm very surprised.  I just see the many sides of spaz here.  After hearing that, there's no doubt in my mind, you're gay.  Yeah.  I'm not gay.  That was interesting.  Because you're the most politically incorrect person I've ever met.  I don't think your fag should be in the Boy Scouts.  That's what I was totally expecting.  He throws you a curveball right when you don't expect it.  So he's a little sensitive to this issue,  because he might know a little more about it than you and I.  No, I'm sensitive.  Why would you, like, I mean, I'm a Boy Scout, that's why.  That's why, I see. 
[00:50:00]  So you would like to have a gay scout lady?  It's, why should, no, but why should we discriminate jobs  based on gays being in the Boy Scouts?  Hey, spaz, I got a question for you.  Yes?  They give out a lot of those ribbons, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right, Opie.  Now we had to dump out of that.  No, I don't.  Now, I'm just thinking, you know, the argument here.  Yes.  I'll play the devil's advocate with you for a moment. 
[00:50:30]  Do you know how to tie a balloon knot?  I'll play the devil's advocate here for a minute.  Sorry.  What people are thinking is that if the Scoutmaster's gay  and there's these young boys running around,  it's almost like saying that you're going to put a piranha,  you're going to take a piranha and throw a guppy in there  and say, oh, it's okay, you know.  Yeah, right up until the point where the piranha eats the guppy.  You know what I mean?  It's like you're asking for trouble. 
[00:51:00]  You're putting them in an environment  where it is a target-rich environment, as they say.  The gays do not equal pedophiles.  Right.  So, Spaz, when you were a Scoutmaster,  did you show all the little boys where the best wood was?  No.  There are three types of wood.  Yeah.  Three types of wood?  There are three types of wood.  All right.  I'd like to hear this.  Yes.  Tender, kindling, and fuel.  Okay.  Tender wood. 
[00:51:30]  You're a tender wood.  Yeah.  Tender wood.  Yes.  Kindling.  And fuel.  And fuel.  And fuel.  All right.  Very good.  We learned something today from you.  Yeah.  Three types of wood.  Flaccid, semi, and hard.  So, sexual preference shouldn't get in the way, is what you're saying today.  No, sexual preference should not.  All right.  All right.  That's the first story, Anthony.  Very good.  Like I said, he threw me a curveball there.  A little surprise.  We're all very surprised. 
[00:52:00]  And what if the scoutmaster has the gay face?  Yeah, but that does not mean he's a pedophile.  What if his teachings are, what if he teaches some of these young children about the gay lifestyle?  No, but he, well, he.  Some parents might not want their children to know about this.  What if one of the kids has poison ivy in a very sensitive place and, you know, the scoutmaster has to put the calamine lotion on?  Or worse yet, what if a poisonous snake bites one in the schween and he's got to suck the blood out? 
[00:52:30]  Well, he's.  It's the poison.  He's saving the kid.  So, what if he's gay?  Now, I think that a gay scoutmaster could also teach a well-rounded scout because, basically, a lot of scoutmasters are those hard asses.  But if you've got.  Hard asses.  It's better to have a soft ass.  But if you've got a gay scoutmaster, he could teach a sensitive side to the kids.  Yeah, I think a lot of people also are worried, once again playing the devil's advocate here, that they will turn the kids gay. 
[00:53:00]  You know what I mean?  No.  No?  You can't turn kids to be gay.  Really?  No, you're born like that.  Oh, is that the truth?  So, you're born gay?  I guess Spaz knows because it's not environment.  It's in the genetics.  It's in the genetics.  Something that people have pondered for centuries.  Spaz has the answer right here.  Sure.  People are born gay, but sometimes they just don't know until later on in the life.  Born gay.  As gay as a flamer.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:53:30]  Hey.  All right.  All right, Spaz.  You totally surprised me on that one.  I thought you would go the other way.  All right.  Okay, let's move on with the second story here to more news.  The Ramses, who are the parents of John Benet Ramsey, are now rejecting a lie detector test.  About a week ago, they decided, hey, you know, let's just put all the rumors to rest that we were not the killers.  And they decided to take a lie detector test.  But now they're rejecting a lie detector test, which it can only mean, in my opinion, and I'm sure the opinions of most around the world on this, is that the Ramses, it was like a little ploy, you know, just to throw them off the beaten track. 
[00:54:00]  Everybody knows that they're the killers.  Otherwise, you know that phrase, thou dost protest too much.  Well, the Ramses do.  Wait a minute.  Thou dost protest too much?  Thou dost?  I meant da dost.  Da dost.  I know you were watching that German fisting video with us.  Ah, das Dumper. 
[00:54:30]  I think you're getting your languages mixed up here today.  It's Shakespearean.  And it means, thou do protest too much.  You do.  Right, like you protest too much.  Yeah, thou dost.  Meaning you're trying to throw people off of your tracks.  Yes.  By protesting too much.  That's what I meant.  Okay.  Otherwise, you know that phrase, thou dost protest too much? 
[00:55:00]  Well, the Ramses do.  And it's because they decided to take a lie detector test.  And now all of a sudden, because it's garbage, because, I don't know, their lawyer,  they said the lawyer and Boulder police cannot agree on independent examiner to administer the test.  It doesn't matter who administers their test.  See, the independent examiner does not have control over what the test results.  The machine does.  So, there's really no excuse there.  Just take the lie detector test and just be done with it. 
[00:55:30]  If they want to prove themselves, but, you know, there are ways to get by a lie detector test.  Like, remain calm.  And if you really strongly believe in your own lies, then it's going to come out as, you know, all cool and good.  All cool and good in everything, Opie.  All cool, good, and everything.  All cool and good.  Oh, my God.  It's much good.  More good.  You don't think the guy administering the test has anything to do with the outcome of the test?  No, the machine does a little squiggly line thing. 
[00:56:00]  They can't influence the machine.  Yeah, but if he asks certain questions, certain leading questions.  Well, yeah, but he doesn't determine what squiggly line goes on the page.  They can definitely lead the test.  Yeah.  They can?  Yes, they can.  Yeah, it's not really.  That's why they're not accepted in a lot of courtrooms is because it's not really a concrete thing.  No, I thought the reason why they didn't accept it is because some machinery breaks down.  There might be a bug in the system or you can't completely trust a machine. 
[00:56:30]  Is he on line 11?  Yeah.  You're in the Boy Scouts.  How far did you go?  I made Eagle.  Eagle, yeah, make it into the Rump Rangers.  Izzy just wants to know.  How about a Rump Rangers?  Izzy?  Izzy?  Izzy, you loser.  All right.  You left.  All right.  So back to the lie detector test with the Ramseys.  Anyway, I just think that it's BS and they should just take the test if they want to once and for all prove that they are not the killers, which everybody knows that they are. 
[00:57:00]  Okay.  I am moving on to the big news, man.  Whoa, what was that?  I am moving up.  Did you do a shot of vodka and puke up your McDonald's right there?  Hey, listen to this.  Okay.  I am moving on to the big news, man.  Rat boy.  You're broadcasting, my friend.  There's a lump of water. 
[00:57:30]  Do you have Tourette's?  No, no.  That's the noise you make just before you throw out a curd.  It's saliva.  All right.  Let's get to rat boy.  Rat boy, Elion Gonzalez.  Apparently, last weekend, they did a whole big raid where General Rito was bawling his or her eyes out, saying that I wish I never did it, but she had to do it.  Actually, almost one year to the date of the Waco, not one year, but a few years to the date of the Waco tragedy, where she stormed into there. 
[00:58:00]  But anyway, she had a whole big question about it.  So she stormed into the Waco thing many years ago?  She sent her troops in there and sent them on fire.  Tragedy, where she stormed into there.  But anyway, yeah, there's a whole big fuss about it, and there's a big picture in the paper about a guy holding a gun to Elion's face when he's screaming and yelling. 
[00:58:30]  Basically, yeah, they stormed in, got the boy out.  I think you send the boy back to Cuba.  I don't know what the fuss is about this kid.  They're going to make movies about him.  And out here, they want to be a part of this parade, this mermaid parade, because people think he's a god.  I just think he's a piece of little garbage.  That's what I think about the Cuban kid.  And Cubans in general.  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:00]  There's the racism.  I've been waiting for that.  Wow.  That's why we were thrown off by the gay Boy Scout guy.  Yeah, gay Boy Scout.  Now we move on.  Okay, he is moving on there.  So the Cubans?  Yes.  You have no use for them?  No.  None whatsoever?  No.  All they do is just take up taxpayer money.  There's no Cuban Americans out there that are good?  No, but they either are welfare or anything.  None whatsoever.  I like to hit his head on the rim of a sink. 
[00:59:30]  Ray O'Donnell is good.  I like Ray O'Donnell.  All right.  So why would you say all Cubans are bad?  Well, there's an example of one you like.  There are always few exceptions to the rule.  Ah, but generally speaking, all Cubans are bad.  Including Yankee Cubans.  Oh.  Wow.  Including Yankee Cubans.  They're bad.  But the Met Cubans are okay.  I like Met Cubans.  Oh, my God.  They're my kind of Cubans.  Oh, my God.  And why are the Cubans bad besides taking up all our money or whatever you say? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, to take up taxpayers' money because they're trying to stay in America because it's a land of opportunity.  Yes.  They want opportunity.  Why don't they just stay in their own country instead of coming over here and flooding ours?  There's going to be no one left of Cuba.  I think they should just overthrow Castro and liberate their own country.  It's happened in the past.  They can do it.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I think he moves on with his Cuban commentary on the Week in Review here, too.  Because don't you get into baseball or something here?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Now we move on to sports because it kind of ties in with the Cuban thing. 
[01:00:30]  Because now all these Cuban sports players like Rayo Dornes and El Duque Hernandez, they're just putting down their gloves to protest this, much like other famous people are doing.  And when the teams really need them, Rayo Dornes should just stick to playing his baseball.  I mean, it's futile to protest this because the inevitable is going to happen.  You cannot go against a government to keep an illegal alien in the country. 
[01:01:00]  There are laws in this country, and if the Cubans want justice in Cuba and everything, stop coming to America.  Just revolt against Castro.  Knock them down.  Revolts have happened in the past.  Just do what you've got to do over in Cuba.  Why are you always going to beg and cry to America for?  And now you're dragging our star players who need to win games for baseball into this mess.  It's just absolutely garbage, to my point.  Oh, my God. 
[01:01:30]  I don't even know where to begin with that.  First of all, the...  You know what it sounds like?  You ever see Alien?  You ever see Alien when the teeth are coming out of the thing's head and all that slime is dripping down?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I picture as he's recording this.  That's Spaz.  So all the Cuban baseball players are putting down their gloves to fight for this kid?  Aren't they still performing and doing their job? 
[01:02:00]  Are they playing?  They're not striking or anything.  No, but...  They're just giving their opinion, which you'd do if you're an American.  But Ray and Cookie Rojas just walked off the field.  And they said that they're going to revolt against the Alien Raid travesty.  Well, whether you agree or disagree, there's a lot of people that are not happy how that was executed.  But Ray needs to go out in the field to entertain us.  He needs to win games for the match.  What is he?  You're like Pit Monkey? 
[01:02:30]  No.  He doesn't have a life?  We've got to win the World Series.  He's supposed to be dedicated to a job.  To you?  He's just a baseball player.  But it's a futile cause.  I don't know about that.  Let me face it.  Nothing's going to happen by holding hands around Alien's house, which taxpayers pay money for.  What, the house?  Taxpayers pay money for that.  I mean, why are we paying money to keep this kid in America?  Just send him back in the raft or drown the kid.  Oh.  Or drown the kid.  Oh.  The guy with the gun in the picture should have shot him. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that's good, Spaz.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  It's your trigger finger.  Little Alien.  It's your trigger finger.  What do you think of the fisherman?  Donato.  I think he's just, like you guys said, just, first of all, he's not even a fisherman.  He only went out one day to fish.  Well, he didn't say, hey, I'm a fisherman.  They dubbed him the fisherman.  The press dubbed him the fisherman.  Yeah, but good thing he wasn't giving an oral favor to a guy.  Right.  Even for one day. 
[01:03:30]  They'd just call him a sea sucker for the rest of his life.  Right.  And there's the sea sucker that, uh, there's that sea sucker.  That rescued Elion Gonzalez.  Hey, it was only once.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  So he's not happy with the fact that he's called the fisherman, Spaz.  Well, he caught Elion, so.  He's a glory hound.  He wants to mount him and keep him.  I agree with you.  He is a glory hound.  Very good.  I mean, he likes the spotlight, yes.  Why are we giving him press for page two of the Daily News? 
[01:04:00]  I mean, come on.  There are other things that are deserving of page two of the Daily News.  Not him, an immigrant.  Like, what's more deserving?  Americans need to be on that front page, not an immigrant.  Donato's not an immigrant, you idiot.  He looks like one.  Oh, that's all.  And I think he's got the gay face.  Does he have the gay face, Donato, the fisherman?  I didn't get a good look.  He likes young boys.  He likes the young boys, yeah.  He's going to sleep in the same bed as the...  Well, there wasn't much room in that house.  Yes. 
[01:04:30]  There was a lot of room in practice.  Yeah, but if he was smart, he should be sleeping in someone else's bed.  Would you like him to be a scout master?  No.  All right, so send the kid back.  Send the kid back.  We don't need him anymore.  We paid too much money to him.  To the kid?  To the kid.  We paid too much money for his living here.  Okay, terrific.  He's eating bacon and eggs for breakfast every morning.  Oh, my God.  Bacon and eggs?  What's wrong with bacon and eggs?  No, but he gets bacon and eggs on shiny silverware, and I'm still eating cereal out of a plastic bowl.  Well, the alien doesn't owe $47,000. 
[01:05:00]  The guy's an immigrant.  You're that pissed because...  You're pissed at that.  That's why he's pissed, because the alien doesn't have $47,000 in debt.  Yeah, if you stopped getting bank loans, you'd be able to buy some fine stuff.  Why can't alien throw me a bone?  No, but why are we getting all this money to him?  Support our own.  Don't support these...  Bad homeless guy's got good silverware.  Because they...  You idiots?  They take him out of the trash.  But alien gets a gift wrap to them. 
[01:05:30]  I mean, come on.  I'm sure it's just the silverware they just happen to have in the house.  I'm sure they went to Kmart, got the silverware.  Yeah.  It doesn't cost much.  The money should be given to a better cause.  Oh, my God.  Like, the cause should be idiots who take out loans well beyond their means.  That's a good cause off the top of my head.  Hey, Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  How are you?  I was wondering if Spaz maybe had a gay Cuban scalito when he was getting his rump range 
[01:06:00]  of badge.  Is it going to be so hostile to the Cubans?  Yeah, a little hostility toward the Cubans.  Yeah, Steve, your phone crapped out.  Sorry about that.  I think it is because of Ileon.  You know, he's getting everything handed to him.  Yeah.  You know, Spaz sees him out there playing with all those cool toys, wearing the new clothes  and the new sneakers, and he's six years old, and there's Spaz, 47 grand in the hole. 
[01:06:30]  He's six years old.  No one giving him any cash.  Six years old, and he's got his college education paid for in America already.  Yeah, but it's at Iona, I heard.  And you speak about, you know, we have to pay for that.  Yes.  Right?  We have to pay for that.  We have to do this.  We have to, you know, money out of our pocket.  Yeah.  Who do you think pays when you decide to declare bankruptcy?  You idiot.  I didn't know that.  I mean, you think that money just magically goes away? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  I thought that the government supplies that or something.  Rob, what's up?  Yo, O-Nay, what's up?  How are you?  I got an idea.  Yeah.  How about we trade, we let Ilians stay, and we trade Spaz for us.  And for a moron to be named...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, watch that.  All right, man.  Sorry.  He's an idiot.  Does he do any research?  Do you do research on these stories, Spaz?  Do you get on your brand new computer that you got with your credit card and do a little research? 
[01:07:30]  No, I'm just...  Hey, the Fisher-Price computer doesn't pull up this stuff.  Speak and speak.  Man, I can't believe...  I suffer through this every week.  I don't know why.  All right, Rob.  Thanks.  You know, you're going to play the dice?  You're going to play the dice thing again?  Yeah, we might get some of that on today.  All right, cool.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Rob.  Syndication never.  No, syndication underground.  Underground.  Booth Lake tapes and whatever it takes to get the word out there.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Guys, I never realized how important Spaz is to this show. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  He really is.  I mean, he just brings new light to everyone.  Yeah.  Are you enlightened on the Cubans now?  I am.  Oh, my God.  Spaz, you listening?  Yes.  You are seriously mental.  I'm serious.  I mean, I cannot believe the stupidity that you have.  You are seriously mental.  These are my beliefs.  I can't even conceive it.  So let it be written.  You are.  So let it be done.  All right.  This is scary. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  There's a very angry person on the line, Tom, so I've got to let you go.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Cappy.  Cappy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Cappy.  What are you talking about, let the boy drown?  How about we drown you?  Oh, no.  Huh?  Are you Cuban, Cappy?  No.  You know what?  I'm not Cuban.  But you know what?  This is a little boy.  His mother, what'd she do?  She lost her life to get that boy some freedom.  If they wanted freedom, they should overthrow the government that is in Cuba.  Well, you know what?  You need to worry about paying back that loan.  How are you going to do that?  Well, the Cubans should worry about overthrowing the world government instead of whining and 
[01:09:00]  bitching about it.  Well, you know what?  How about you?  You whine and bitch all the time.  Everybody has a right to, ma'am.  Well, you know what?  You're right.  Everybody does have a right to, but it's not easy for those people.  You know what?  We got it good.  So, you know what?  This little boy made it out here.  Let's just leave him here.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Come on.  The Americans revolted against the British way back when, so why don't the Cubans do it  now against Castro?  Well, why don't you go to Cuba and help them?  Obviously, they're having trouble doing that.  Yeah, you can be that leader. 
[01:09:30]  Are you going to help me?  The one that makes it happen.  You know what?  Yeah, I'll get you to Cuba.  You know what I'll do?  I'll put you on a raft and kick you right up the butt and get you going there.  Whoa!  So, if I help the Cubans, you're going to help me pay my debt?  You know what?  Worry about, you know what that other caller said?  Do some research on your new computer that you bought with your credit card?  Why don't you do that?  I bought a computer with your credit card.  Why don't you do that?  Worry about paying you.  Let her have it.  Let her have it.  It's spaz radio.  It's spaz radio.  So, if I go up there, I'm going to put my little six and a half foot right up your butt  and get you to Cuba real quick.  Just worry about your trailer park life. 
[01:10:00]  No, it's not trailer park, honey.  All right, Cappy.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Very good job.  Diego makes a very good point.  Diego.  Yeah.  How are you, Diego?  What's up, Bo?  And I have a question here.  Why does he hate the Cubans so bad, but he likes the gay scout leader?  Right.  Huh.  That's fine to have, the gay scout leader, but Cubans.  You must really hate Cubans.  Hey.  Really?  I mean, I have no problem sending all the Cubans back. 
[01:10:30]  You know what?  I have no problem with that, but I mean.  It's no disrespect to your people, Rick.  My people.  Rick isn't Cuban.  Your people.  But I can't tell.  Rick isn't Cuban.  I got it.  No, but the thing is, I can't tell between a Puerto Rican, a Cuban, and a Dominican.  I can't tell the difference, so I just lump them all into one section.  There is no difference.  You know what?  He has a point, because I can't tell between idiots, stupid people, and total, complete morons. 
[01:11:00]  So there you go, Spaz.  I can't tell the difference, because they all have the same shade of color.  Shade of color.  Shade, yeah.  Shade of color.  Shade of color?  What?  In between black and white.  They do not.  There's all different shades of even the Hispanic people.  Oh, there are?  There's all different shades of black people, too.  Yeah, and I don't like any of them, either.  Yeah, send them back, too.  Someone should have sent them back a long time ago.  Hey, Spaz, guess what?  There are a lot of shades of Americans.  Pat, what's up? 
[01:11:30]  Hey.  How are you?  Oh, and hey, I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  You know, I thought I was one of the stupid people on the planet.  Jesus.  Why, you don't agree with anything Spaz is saying?  What?  Yeah.  Happily not.  No.  I don't know if this is a gag you do every week or the man just lacks total education.  What's up with you, Spaz?  I don't think he researches a lot of this stuff, yeah.  Let's just pump them all together.  Hey!  Yeah, you know?  He just speaks his mind, sir. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  All right, Pat.  Horrible, horrible.  All right.  Imagine the indecision he'd have if it was a gay Cuban scout leader.  Yeah, that would be a tough decision, huh, Spaz?  Very tough.  It would be.  All right, listen.  This fact's just in.  Spaz's hotel bill for one night, $750.  Mm-hmm.  Spaz's debt, $47,000.  Week in review at Spaz, priceless.  Priceless.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue with Spaz's week in review. 
[01:12:30]  On the way, he talks about hookers.  Trying to remember all the stuff.  Conga.  Mm-hmm.  Darva, right?  Yes.  Oh, Darva.  Um, and a few other things.  Uh, Rudy's cancer.  Yes.  Ah.  Very, very big story.  He's going to tell us all where the prostate is, Anthony.  All right.  We're going to learn where the prostate is today, Anthony.  Thank God, because I don't have a clue.  I believe he thinks it's the same place where the girls put the tampons, Anthony. 
[01:13:00]  Okay, terrific.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never yet all.  Lopey and Anthony.  Their brains are in their pants.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes.  Thousands of people losing weight with stacker two.  As I have a mouthful of food, Opie.  You got me.  Hmm.  Well, I don't think you need the stacker two, Anthony.  No.  Yourself there. 
[01:13:30]  A lot of people do need the stacker two.  They're trying to get in shape for summer.  Yes.  Summer right around the corner.  If the sun ever comes back out.  Ugh.  Are we supposed to have a good weekend?  Does anyone know?  I've written off any nice weather.  I've just given up.  Cold.  Nasty.  Ugh.  This is what happened last year, too.  Two years in a row like this.  Anyway, yeah.  It lulls you into a false sense of security with your body, doesn't it?  Yeah, you just sit at home with Twinkies and eat.  And then all of a sudden, it's hot. 
[01:14:00]  Now you really got to show off your skin.  And there's a lot more of it than there was last summer, isn't there?  Mm-hmm.  Stacker two, world's strongest fat burner.

[01:14:30]  It'll be while I try to swallow the rest of my sandwich.  All right.  Remember the days we were able to take breaks in between talking on the radio?  Doesn't happen.  Doesn't happen anymore.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Go online, and you can check them out that way, www.stacker2.com,  or give them a call, 1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs, 107-WNEW. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  It's the O&H Show, 212-757-1027.  We're in the middle of Spaz's Week in Review.  Ben Stein should be calling in any second here, Anthony, from Win Ben Stein's Money.  Yeah.  Maybe you could go on that program, Spaz, to help out your debt problem.  Or a millionaire.  Or a millionaire.  Spaz on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.  That could be a good show for you.  I've been practicing at home.  You've been practicing Who Wants to Be a Millionaire at home?  With the computer game? 
[01:15:30]  Yes.  There you go.  Spaz.  Spaz in the hot seat.  Is that your final answer?  Let's go to the phones real fast.  Brian, what's up?  He's an idiot, gentlemen.  Are you sure?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  All right.  Happy birthday, Ant.  There's no way he could be that stupid.  If you guys did, like, a midichlorian count on him, he's got to be Jedi Knight material.  He's just so stupid, he's got to be, like, smart.  I mean, like, Einstein couldn't relate to normal human beings, and Spaz can't either, 
[01:16:00]  so that means he's got to be genius material.  Yeah.  It would be.  Spaz, have you invented anything in your life?  No, but I always wanted to.  Yeah?  Any ideas?  Do you have any inventions in your head?  Have you ever thought of some way, maybe, that mankind could do something a little better  than they're doing it now?  Actually, I wrote some ideas down at home.  There's got to be one.  Anything you remember off the top of your head?  Problem solver.  Wrote it a long time ago. 
[01:16:30]  Any type of internal combustion engine, perhaps?  Well, I've got to wait to clean up the air.  Or a little something like that.  Yes.  And what's that?  They wrote it down all at home, that the statistics and linguistics of it.  All right.  Maybe I'll have to bring those in.  Yeah, could you bring your inventions in for us?  I want to see what kind of inventions he has.  Yes.  Okay.  We're all looking forward to checking out your inventions.  Oh, yeah.  Tony Montana, what's up? 
[01:17:00]  Yes, I want to talk to that little Spaz.  Yeah, what's up, Tony?  Hey, Spaz, can you hear me?  Tony, the cops coming.  Run.  Yes, sir.  Tony Montana.  Spaz.  Yes.  Do you know what a hoss is?  An ass?  A hoss.  A hoss.  That's a pig that don't fly straight, Spaz.  That's you, Spaz.  Why are you talking about a Cuban-American like that?  All right.  I'm not going to choo-choo.  I'm not going to choo-choo.  Manolo, choo-choo this piece-age. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  Let's get back into Spaz's Week in Review.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Speaking of garbage, Darryl Strawberry.  Darryl Strawberry has decided to leave his rehab in Florida because he says he's ready to go out into a civilized world.  And play baseball again. 
[01:18:00]  Strawberry, here's a hint.  Just stay where you are because you're only going to end up back there anyway.  So wherever rehab he's in, where he was in, I say just save his bed and save his room.  Keep it available because he'll be back.  Because he's just washed up.  His best years were with the Mets.  And when the Mets didn't need him anymore because he was washed up, when he was still coked up and boozing, the Mets got all their thing out of him and just gave him to the Yankees, which is the cesspool of baseball. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, really?  Speaking of baseball, the Yankees are the cesspool of baseball.  Why do you think the Yankees are the cesspool of baseball?  I'm embarrassed to be a Mets fan.  All the rejects go.  Because Spaz is a Mets fan.  All the rejects go to the Yankees.  Well, they're doing something right.  They've won a few World Series lately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's because when they can't beat them, they recruit them.  They recruit them.  Yes.  So why, when these same players were on the Mets in recent years, didn't they win a World Series? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Since 86.  Since 86.  Well, they came close in 88 against the Dodgers.  Yeah, they came close.  That's right.  I mean, they were a great team, but the strawberry was just washed up when he left the Mets, I believe in 89 or 90.  Why the hatred for the Yankees so much?  Because they're, I said it before and I'll say it again, they're cocky.  They're stuck up.  They think they're number one when they're not.  Well, no, Spaz, they are.  And Ricky Henderson's not cocky and stuck up. 
[01:19:30]  See, because he's the biggest a-hole in the league, and we have to deal with him on the Mets.  And look where he came from.  The Yankees.  He came from Oakland.  Yeah, exactly.  I think he played for Oakland a little more than he did with the Yankees.  But he took that Yankee mentality with him.  Oh, my God.  The Yankees go around like they're all big and number one.  Yes, but they're not.  They are number one.  They won the World Series.  Yeah.  See, they have what they call bragging rights. 
[01:20:00]  A winning attitude.  Yeah, but they don't act like winners.  I don't see them, you know, jumping up and down.  They don't act like winners.  What are they doing wrong?  I mean, I'm a Mets fan defending the Yankees, but I feel like I have to.  They act like a-hole braggarts.  What do they do?  What have they done that don't act like that?  They don't show it in anyone's face.  They win, and that's it.  It's not like they're jumping up and down on the side of the road going,  Ah, ah, ah, ah, we are the best.  They might as well do that because they're not doing that blatantly, but they're doing it subtly.  Give me an example of the Yankees rubbing it in our faces. 
[01:20:30]  Every year that the Mets-Yankees series comes up, they go up to the Mets and say,  Well, you know, we kicked your ass the last few times, so this is just like a blow-by series.  We'll just kick your ass again and be on our merry way.  What player was quoted as saying that?  Yeah.  They basically say they have that attitude, like,  Okay, we're going to come in here and win three games, and then we're going to leave.  The Mets can kick their ass any time, but any time.  All right, listen.  I have an announcement to make.  I am officially a Yankee fan. 
[01:21:00]  I hope he's changing ass.  Yeah, I think I might have to change sides.  And umpires, I think, favor the Yankees because of their, you know, past lineage.  Their past lineage?  Edge?  Lineage?  What?  Oh, my God.  Their past lineage?  Lineage.  Lineage.  Lineage.  And what's this past lineage?  It's because they were the first team ever in baseball.  No, they weren't!  Oh, my God.  You can't play with yourself!  They just got together and waited for years. 
[01:21:30]  They waited?  Where's another team so we can play?  Hey, we're winners again this year.  No one else to play.  Who did they play with while they waited for another team to come along?  Way back in 1876, there were only three teams.  The Yankees, the Dodgers, and the Washington Senators.  Very wrong.  Right.  Wrong!  And the Milwaukee Braves, four teams.  The Milwaukee Braves.  Ah.  Way back in 1876.  I know.  I know.  Dude, you want to shake it.  I know. 
[01:22:00]  People want to strangle you.  The Yankees!  They were the only team with the Dodgers and the Washington Senators.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  The Dodgers!  In L.A.?  Brooklyn.  But then they all got typhoid fever back then.  It was before cancer.  Cancer wasn't invented until 1910.  I thought that's how I understood it.  Well, yeah, you understand a lot.  Wow.  All right, let's get back to your argument, the Met-Yankee argument.  I'm dumbfounded. 
[01:22:30]  Don't you think when the time comes when the Mets do win the World Series,  which is this year,  that we will be rubbing it into the Yankees fans' faces?  It's just what we do in this city of ours.  No, the Mets will be dignified.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Dignified.  You're crazy.  It's the same argument with the Islanders and the Rangers.  Know how many years we abused the Ranger fans?  Eh-heh.  1940.  And then they finally win, and they're giving it back to us.  It's just how it is. 
[01:23:00]  It just so happens the Mets haven't won in a while,  but as soon as the Mets win, we're going to give it right back to the Yankee fans.  No, the Mets are dignified.  Dignified.  They have standards.  What?  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  I think too much jet fuel from the planes going into LaGuardia have been dumped on your head.  Sitting up in the...  I think I broke my head.  I got so excited.  Give me some ice.  Jack, what's up? 
[01:23:30]  Oh, God.  I can't believe you let this jackass talk.  I can't believe you let this jackass talk.  Hey, Spaz, you paying attention, Spaz?  You dumb crap.  The Yankees were not around in 1876.  The planet you came from was not around in 1876, you douchebag.  The Yankees started playing baseball, if I recall correctly, in 1921 or 1918,  and Yankee Stadium was built and opened in 1923. 
[01:24:00]  I forget the year myself, but...  Well, we've got to go back to the start to find out.  Spaz, Spaz, pay close attention here.  The Yankees did not...  I'm sorry, the Mets did not give up Strawberry because he was washed up, you dumb douche.  They gave him up because he was on drugs,  and the Yankees did not take him because, oh, we need a team.  We need a player that's washed up that can suck so we lose a lot.  Spaz, you dumb crap.  They took him because he has one of the strongest power swings in baseball, 
[01:24:30]  and he can hit a home run well over 400 feet,  and he can hit many of them.  You know, like the ones that keep hitting you in the head, you moron?  And, Spaz, let me teach you a little bit English also.  Pay close attention, Spaz.  It's not, thou dost protest.  It's, thou dost protest.  Right.  The other way is, thou dost are an idiot.  Yes.  I think maybe the water that fell on your head was acid,  and it seeped into your brain, you moron. 
[01:25:00]  Go pay off your debts.  Maybe we can export your ass out of the country.  We can use your long, lanky body as a flagpole,  and they're going to Cuba, you douchebag.  Take a flag in your ass, you scout boy.  Jack.  You moron.  Jack, you're funny.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  Please, please, do me a favor.  I beg you.  I beg you.  I'll send you down a keg of beer.  Shoot him in the head and do it on the air.  I want to hear, on the air,  I want to hear the bullet go into that moron's addle-brained empty head. 
[01:25:30]  All right, Jack.  Thank you.  God.  Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  Some instant feedback coming in.  This one, George Steinbrenner checking in from the Bronx.  Okay.  Hey, Spaz, I don't owe any money.  Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  Greg from Jersey, tell him to take out another 20 grand and get an effing education.  And the Braves were in Boston, Spaz.  And I don't, and Bob wants to say that Milwaukee didn't even exist in 1870. 
[01:26:00]  He said, Bob, what's up?  Hey, O-N-A, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, Spaz, all right, check this out.  I don't even think Wisconsin was a state.  All right, Milwaukee is a city.  Wisconsin is a state.  Milwaukee is in Wisconsin, okay?  Yeah, I know.  I don't even think Wisconsin was a state in 1876.  You effing idiot.  Could someone check that for us?  Get an almanac out and see if Milwaukee even existed in 1876?  All right, I graduated from high school. 
[01:26:30]  I didn't spend $27,000 on an education.  Actually, I do believe Wisconsin was part of the Louisiana Purchase.  Okay.  Which was indeed done before 1876.  Before 1876, but I believe it was a territory.  I mean, not?  Well, now we're debating semantics, my friend.  You're right.  I think Corky Steinbrenner should check in on this, and he should offer up his opinion. 
[01:27:00]  All right, Bob, thank you.  Later, guys.  All right, bye.  What a business.  Spaz, do you know what semantics means?  Semantics.  I believe I have an idea.  And it's basically the logistics of it, the formality of it.  I remember when Laura Ingalls and Paul went to go see the first Yankee game.  Joe, what's up?  It was a shame because Mary was blind at the time, and she took the whole block school, and  they couldn't see the game.  It was terrible. 
[01:27:30]  Spaz probably made logic out of things.  Joe, sorry, we had to cut you off.  What did you say?  I said, I don't know how my car is pointed straight down the road.  In anger, I ripped the steering wheel off.  I'm going to make heads or tails out of him.  Does he listen to himself when he opens his mouth?  I know.  I think I broke my head.  I got so pissed.  And I'm a Met fan, and I had to stick up for the Yankee fans.  How crazy is that?  You know, it's a shame where you've got to cut your losses and drop your favorite team  because you're on the same side as a total moron. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you, Joe.  Sorry, guys.  I don't know how you guys put up with it without shaking them.  Do me a favor.  Grab them and shake them for the rest of us out here.  They're slipping out.  You really piss off people.  I remember when George Washington threw out the first pitch between the Yankees and the Florida Marlins.  David's saying the Yankees started in 1903, Anthony.  1903.  I'm getting reports that the Yankees were called the New York Highlanders first, and it was 1911.  Okay. 
[01:28:30]  Steve from the Bronx writes,  My Iona diploma is dropping in value faster than Microsoft.  That's good.  Let's go to Jack real fast.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Do you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Oh, you there?  Yeah, let's go, Jack.  Yeah, this is very scary, guys.  Yeah, this kid's so stupid.  I think if he's moving his dinner plate four inches to the right, he'll start to the right.  Oh, boy.  This is too good today. 
[01:29:00]  Craig, what's going on?  Hey, I think we should get all these bigs that listen to your radio show.  Yeah.  Get the $47,000 together and kick them off the show.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying they'll send in money if you will stop your weekend review spaz.  That's enough.  If I only had a brain.  You've got to get a picture of spaz in his Boy Scout uniform.  Do you still have that spaz?  I still have my uniform.  Oh, God damn it.  Dude, he's got to come in dressed in that Boy Scout uniform.  Does it fit you at all? 
[01:29:30]  The shirt is a little small.  All right, this is what we're going to do.  This is what we're going to do.  All right?  I'm going to admit this.  I am stealing this idea from a homeless guy that I see in Times Square when I walk down to Penn Station.  Yeah.  We want you to come to work one day next week in your Boy Scout uniform.  We are going to have you hold a sign that simply says, for five bucks, you can insult me.  And you stand there with your Boy Scout uniform and the sign.  That's pretty good. 
[01:30:00]  And people can come outside the studio, outside the Brooklyn Diner.  They will hand you five bucks so they can yell and scream at you.  You will make a bloody fortune.  But people will just insult me without giving me the money.  No, no, no.  We'll make sure.  We'll have Rick down there, Psycho Mark.  We'll make sure it's all planned.  They'll have to line up.  They hand over their five bucks.  And they can say whatever they want to you.  Just one insult?  No, but they've got to get a string until they run out of steam.  Yeah, they get a little string.  They get one minute.  No more than a minute. 
[01:30:30]  Look, we are collecting money ready.  We've got 50 bucks.  Insult spaz for five bucks.  Are you game?  Next week.  Okay.  You will probably make a couple hundred bucks, easily.  I can put that towards my desk.  What day do you guys want to do insult spaz for five bucks?  Tuesday.  Okay.  Tuesday.  I want all the listeners to show up and line up.  Give your five bucks.  You can get a wow sticker and stuff, too.  And you get to insult spaz and yell at him and say whatever you want. 
[01:31:00]  Because people are freaking out out there.  Okay.  But you have to wear the Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  Sash and all?  Sash and all.  Okay.  We're setting that up for Tuesday.  Insult spaz for five bucks.  Okay?  Okay.  All right, Anthony.  We've got to take a break.  Aw.  Ben Stein is on the line.  We're going to talk to him next.  And then we'll get back into spaz's week in review.  Spaz, stick around.  I learned something.  Ben Stein, very intelligent man.  A very intelligent man.  As a matter of fact, you can help us with the interview, spaz.  Should be an interesting little contrast.  Sure.  It is spaz radio today. 
[01:31:30]  You might as well sit in on a little interview with us.  Ben Stein, super genius.  And spaz.  Well, we all know what spaz is all about.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  We'll be back with Ben Stein next.  Stay there.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about?  Dopey and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027 WNAW.  I'm feeling good all over.  And here's the reason why.  I took souls like car to car cash. 
[01:32:00]  I'm in love with those car cash guys.  Hey, Anthony, car cash.  Yeah, this is the way to sell your car.  You don't want to be hassled with the newspaper ads.  God, we've all done that at one point in our lives, right?  You have your car.  You're trying to sell it.  You take the ad out in the paper.  You try to make it sound all cool and stuff.  You put your home phone number there.  Three in the morning, you're getting calls from people.  God forbid there's a misprint in the paper.  All of a sudden, your Corvette is being sold for 20 bucks. 
[01:32:30]  And you're getting calls at all hours from people.  It's a big pain in the ass.  And then the person that comes over the house and tries to chew down the value of your car.  And he's looking underneath saying,  Well, it seems to be something with the item, bam, a muffler bearing.  And they're like, what?  I'm not a mechanic.  What?  I just want to sell my car.  And then there's a lot of people out there that just feel guilty asking for a high price.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, I know it's worth like three grand, but I'll sell it for two grand.  How about the phone call from the guy a week after you sell the car? 
[01:33:00]  Hello.  Hello, Sidney.  My car broke down.  What happened?  You sold it to me, and now it doesn't run.  I'm coming to you, Sidney.  And then you don't want to deal with that.  Car Cash.  Yeah, simple as this, guys.  If you're going to be selling your ride in the near future, call Car Cash.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  They give you a top dollar.  You know, your car.  No fooling around. 
[01:33:30]  They make it so freaking easy to sell your car, it's not even funny.  Give them a call, 1-800-CAR-CASH, 1-800-CAR-CASH, or visit Car Cash on the web at www.carcash.com,  or stop by Car Cash on West 55th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues in Manhattan.  Give them a call, 1-800-CAR-CASH.  That's 1-800-CAR-CASH.  I'm just f***ing around.  Here we go.  O.P.  Anthony.  Our genius gets lost. 
[01:34:00]  It's crap.  I'm going to cut the crap on this end, I can tell you that.  1-0-2-7-W-M-E-W.  All right, Anthony, lots going on in the show today.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark heading out of the building in about ten minutes.  He's got more WoW stickers to give out right outside the building.  He'll be in front of the Brooklyn Diner on the corner of 57th and 7th Street with the  brand-new WoW stickers, so you can get them before you head home tonight, okay?  Hold.  All right.  He'll be there in about ten, fifteen minutes, tops. 
[01:34:30]  But right now, we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi, how are you?  There we go.  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price of  a car?  No, he said chew down.  You just said chew down.  Oh, that's a lot different.  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  I see.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben.  Okay.  And you being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before 
[01:35:00]  we talked to Ben Stein.  Talk to Ben Stein.  I see.  You sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do.  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism.  Well, it's a term that is used.  Chew. 
[01:35:30]  Not chew.  I wouldn't have said chew down.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Okay, well, it sounds just like chew down, and anybody who's listening to it is going  to know you're saying chew down with a tiny, tiny change in the acronym.  It sounds like chew down.  Oh, my God, Ben.  Are you this insane?  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or chew down? 
[01:36:00]  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  The guy's effing out of his mind.  Ben Stein just hung up on us.  He's trying to get into some kind of racial argument over a chew down?  I said chew down.  I think he's still on ludes.  The man's a frigging lunatic.  Get him back on the phone.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe Ben Stein hung up on us. 
[01:36:30]  We were doing Comedy Central a favor.  We don't need Ben Stein on our show.  Holy smoke.  And then, in turn, he hangs up on us?  You know, if he had an iota of a reason to be upset about anything that was said here,  I would let him speak his piece and actually get a few words in.  He was making no sense.  Is he insane?  You've never heard the term chew?  Chew down.  Chew down.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  He is sort of effing fiable.  Wow, I thought he was kidding.  Hi.  Hi, boys.  What are you saying?  Chew down.  You can't get him back on the line?  I called the people who are taking care of it.  They're going to...  I think he's on the phone with them right now.  Let me tell you something.  You know what?  Do you think that...  I am amazed.  I am frigging stunned.  And this is why we don't have celebrities on our show. 
[01:37:30]  Because, first of all, they don't get the show.  Second of all, they're all high and mighty.  Hey.  Hey, I'm Ben Stein.  Hey, I could almost do a Ben Stein impression.  I think someone's drinking out there.  Ben, you've got to be crazy to think that...  Oh, I said you've got to be crazy.  You're a wacky Jew bastard.  Oh, my...  I can't believe he got that upset.  When I wasn't even saying...  Is that the point we're at in this country?  Where you can't even say things that sound like something else? 
[01:38:00]  That was his whole argument.  It sounded too close to Jew down.  Even though we didn't even say Jew down.  As I figure it.  So, Ben, we didn't even say that.  So, Ben, you're trying to say that we think all Jews are cheap?  Chew down.  That's the term you use when someone walks up to you and is trying to get a bargain on a price that you have set.  They are trying to chew down the price, aren't they? 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  He's a cheater.  The man is insane.  I am stunned that this man is this friggin' crazy.  Get him back on the line.  I understand a Jewish man's concern with anti-Semitism fine and dandy when you have a legitimate argument.  Stuff like that is downright insane and dangerous.  Rob from the city. 
[01:39:00]  You racist bastards.  First you offend The Rock, now Ben Stein.  I thought The Rock was crazy.  Wait.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Ben Stein's a cheap Jew, though.  Stop it, Opie.  I'm not saying all Jews, but Ben is.  He thinks it's hip to wear sneakers with suits.  No, it's because he doesn't want to, you know, spend the money for a nice pair of shoes.  Are you just, like, dumbfounded at this?  It's...  The guy comes across on his show as a very intelligent man. 
[01:39:30]  But that's why, you know, that's why we don't bother with celebrities.  They're all just...  They're just ass wipes, most of them.  Complete ass wipes.  Well, that's it.  And then doesn't even give us a chance to explain.  Chew me.  Chew me, Ben Stein.  You did explain.  Chew it.  You did explain yourself, actually.  I can explain myself in utter disbelief that I even had to explain myself.  Let's play one of the Jewish songs now.  Alan, what's going on? 
[01:40:00]  Yo, Anthony, he said chew down.  That guy's a retard.  Chew down.  Exactly.  Common friggin' English.  Get him on the line so I can play Joe's song for him.  He won't call back.  He won't call back?  He won't.  He won't call back.  Hi.  I'm an ass wife.  We were doing him and Comedy Central a favor.  Rick, you know the comedy, the Daily Show Minute?  It doesn't run anymore on our show. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't run anymore on our show.  Oh, my God.  We do them a favor by running the Daily Show Minute in the 2 o'clock hour every day.  Gone.  See ya.  Bye.  I'm not going to have Ben Stein make us look like idiots.  Unbelievable.  If some, you know something, if someone even has an iota of a reason to be upset with us, fine.  That came so far out of left field for no friggin' reason. 
[01:41:00]  Unbelievable.  Ben.  Hello, hello.  Ben Stein's calling back.  Ben!  Put him on hold so I can talk to him!  Hello?  Ben.  Hello.  Ben Stein, everyone.  I'm back.  What's the problem, man?  Well, I was a little upset with the Jew comment.  Uh, no, Anthony said chew.  Chew down.  Chew down.  Chew down, yes. 
[01:41:30]  Unbelievable, the blatant racism going on in your program.  If it was about the chinks or the spades, I wouldn't care.  But my own people.  Yeah.  The Jew.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony definitely said chew and not Jew.  I don't care.  Chew, that's a derogatory term for a Chinaman.  Achoo.  Achoo.  All right, screw it.  I'll be right back.  All right, I was kidding. 
[01:42:00]  Rick, that's unbelievable.  Definitely throw the Daily Show Minutes in the garbage.  I'm not going to have Ben Stein do that to us.  Please.  Yeah, what happens when someone sneezes?  Achoo!  What?  What was that?  I can't believe you just said that.  You know, the next time we do that commercial, too, we are going to use the word Jew. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Ben Stein.  Hell, if he's going to be pissed at us, I know he's listening right now.  Hey, Ben, take a listen to this.  Oh, my dear.  I'll build some ovens just to cook up shoes.  Oh.  We'd sweep them down and guess them good.  Sold their clothes and shoes.  With a day team here at all times.  Oh, no, that's not right.  Here, I'll build some ovens just to cook up shoes. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, my dear.  I wanted lampshade made up Hebrew skin.  We'd peel it off and hang to dry before we screw them in.  With a nipple here and a navel there.  Don't you skin with too much hair?  Oh, my dear.  I needed lampshade made up Hebrew skin.  Oh, my dear.  And why did you not cook swapses and speaks? 
[01:43:30]  You let the mongrels get the brazy meeks and hocks and shakes.  Oh, my dear.  Get an outfung here and a sing higher there.  Get a juice and a chew every minute.  You were my dear and needed ovens just to cook some juice.  Oh, my dear.  There you go, Ben.  And now you have a reason because, Opie, you ass wife.  First of all, that wasn't appropriate.  Obviously, that was one of the entries to the contest we had, 
[01:44:00]  the most offensive song ever played on the Opie and Anthony show.  And being played out of context like that,  it might bring up some issues with some people.  Now, if you would explain that that song was indeed entered into the contest  we were having on this program,  the most offensive song ever to be aired on the show contest,  people would understand that is why we were playing the song.  You played it in anger.  And I cannot agree with that. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.  What happened to Anthony?  Hey.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I say we boycott the show.  Ah, whatever.  Do what you want.  That was just, that was just...  If you were a Jew...  If you were listening, you heard exactly what he said.  Yeah.  He didn't say anything racist.  What a pussy.  For a change.  What a pussy to it.  He hung up on us.  It's like, why don't you argue it further?  Ben Stein, my God. 
[01:45:00]  Well, you know he was a speechwriter for Nixon.  What, the crazy years?  What, did you write that rambling checkers speech?  I don't know.  Who said Jew?  So we hung up.  All right.  The speechwriter for one of the biggest anti-Semites in the White House.  I hate that Jew, Henry Kissinger.  Where's Ben Stein?  That Jew.  Oh, there you go.  Unbelievable.  That's funny, too.  You do someone a favor and that's what happens.  Okay.  That's good. 
[01:45:30]  That's beautiful.  You know something?  Listen, yeah, if we have a tape of me saying that, did you tape the commercial?  The chew down?  Yeah.  Of course we did.  Play that and then I want to hear Ben Stein again.  I got to hear exactly what he said.  I want to, because I didn't think he was that angry.  I thought he had a sense of humor and was playing along or something.  I could not possibly believe a man who comes across so intelligent on TV is so ignorant. 
[01:46:00]  I can't confirm this, but FC from Baldwin writes, I was watching Ben Stein's Money one  day and Jimmy Kimmel, who's a friend of the show, mentioned Ben Franklin's kite and Ben  thought he said kike and yelled at him.  I said I can't confirm that.  Yeah, why would someone ask him, why would you penalize Jon Stewart because Ben Stein said ass?  No, I didn't say, we're just not going to run the Daily Show Minute.  We're not telling people to boycott. 
[01:46:30]  We got dicked over again.  The Opie and Anthony show, we don't need to interview Ben Stein to get good ratings.  We were doing somebody a favor.  We thought it would be kind of cool, quick five minute interview with Ben Stein.  Where's Joe Lyon from Comedy Central?  He ain't calling.  Come on, Joe.  He ain't calling.  Get him on the horn.  I want to know what's behind all this.  He ain't calling.  Oh my God.  That doesn't sit well with us at all. 
[01:47:00]  That's just sad.  How were you a Nixon speechwriter in like the 70s, right?  And you're so like left on the political scale.  Like so far to the left.  Yeah, they're trying to get him back on the line.  All right, we got to take a break, Anthony.  All right.  We'll find the commercial where you said chew.  Chew.  Chew down.  And then we'll...  Did I listen to a commercial?  Oh. 
[01:47:30]  Oh.  All right.  On the way, Shane McMahon, if he's brave enough to call our show.  Oh my God.  I better watch what I say.  What nationality are the McMahons?  Irish?  Oh my God.  Let's not talk about how much the Irish drink.  For God's sake.  I'm going to call his sister a slut.  See how long it takes for him to hang up.  Why not?  Oh my God.  All right, Anthony.  That's our Ben Stein interview.  Okay, great.  Where's Jimmy Kimmel?  Huh?  Where's Jimmy Kimmel?  Get him on the phone, too.  Yeah.  Tell Rick to call Jimmy Kimmel up. 
[01:48:00]  I was going to say, the guy you work with is the biggest tight ass.  Well, he worked close to him for a while there, a few years.  Yeah.  He might have some insight into this.  He still is.  He's still co-hosting the show with him.  Well, I think he's actually done.  The show's there running.  Yeah.  He already taped, and there's going to be a new host.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, Kimmel's definitely leaving the show.  I'm not sure exactly when, but...  Good for Jimmy.  All right, let's take a break, and we'll be back. 
[01:48:30]  We still have to get back into Spazz's Week in Review.  Shane McMahon checking in.  And more stupidity on the way.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  187-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Ben Stein just hung up on us. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  I was up with that guy.  Shane McMahon just hung up on us.  Hey, where did Shane go?  What a cluster up today.  Why are all our guests hanging up on us, Anthony?  Well, Shane, I think it might have been a technical glitch.  I believe so.  I don't think.  They got Backlash Sunday on pay-per-view.  Looks like it's going to be an exciting one, Anthony.  Stone Cold Steve Austin in the Rock's Corner.  Stone Cold Steve Austin on SmackDown last night. 
[01:49:30]  Very, very exciting stuff happening with the WWF lately.  Yes.  We're getting the Ben Stein stuff together to replay, because that was just out of left field.  I mean, I got to hear him again just to, I have a hard time believing that was serious.  And Ben, if you're still listening, I'm sure if someone at Comedy Central is listening, tell Ben Stein he's a retard.  The phones are just exploding.  Saying he's a retard.  To chew down a price.  I don't care what it sounds like. 
[01:50:00]  That isn't what I said.  It isn't what I meant.  Uh, Lewis, what's up?  Yeah, dudes, I can't believe how dumb this old effer is.  He's complaining that the word chew down sounded like a racial floor.  Chew down.  Hey, Ben, you paying attention?  Ben, there's a word in the English language called niggardly.  It means cheap.  Oh, no, we're insulting the spokes.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I don't think you're really making your points.  Well, a lot of people.  The guy's a moron.  A lot of people.  The guy's a moron. 
[01:50:30]  You've got to stop getting these morons on your show.  You've got spans.  That's enough.  Yeah, the sad part is we're doing somebody a favor.  We don't need Ben Stein on our radio show to get good ratings, trust me.  Yeah, we thought it would be, you know, a fun, quick little interview.  He could plug his show, and then we're done.  He was great in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, you know, the one line he had, you know.  But then, you know, it really enters dangerous territory.  Well, now we've got a Jewish guy on the line that wants to speak his mind. 
[01:51:00]  Simon.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  I apologize for playing that song to you.  I was just so pissed off.  I really wanted to give him, personally, something to be pissed off at if he was going to hang  up on us.  So I do apologize to you personally.  No, absolutely no need.  You know what I mean?  Well, I'm sure I've got...  I think it's pretty good anybody with half a brain who listens to your show.  Yeah.  But you guys are doing it in good humor.  All right.  For real, for real.  Yeah, I mean, I was listening to the ad right beforehand, and it didn't even cross my mind that you  had said anything.  That's what got me so, like, agitated. 
[01:51:30]  I know what I said.  Yeah.  And I know what I meant by it.  And that is common knowledge that to chew down a price, you're chewing the price down.  Right.  Nibbling away at the price.  Nibbling away.  Chewing the price down.  Right.  It has nothing to do with chewing down the price.  Exactly.  I mean, people, I think, are sensitive to it.  The sensitivity in this country has gotten way out of hand, personally.  And he's trying to tell me what I meant by it? 
[01:52:00]  Exactly.  He said that it sounded like something else you were saying.  It's like, you know what, man?  You cleaned it up.  You said exactly what you meant to say.  And it's like, just leave it alone, Ben.  Yeah, we'll let you make your own decision.  We're going to play it again in a few minutes here.  But I've got to cut you off because our buddy, our pal, Shane McMahon, is on the hotline.  I'd rather hear him than me.  Go ahead.  All right, cool.  We've got to try.  Why am I such a retard?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Shane O'Mac.  What's up, fellas?  Shane.  How are you guys doing?  There he is.  How are you, sir?  Excellent.  I've got to say congratulations to you guys. 
[01:52:30]  Number one drive time.  Phenomenal.  Oh, thank you.  Picking ass.  Two years.  And, you know, I've got to say, you know, Anthony, happy 42nd birthday.  Yeah, right?  You know, that was great.  Sorry I was a little belated, but I wanted to wish it to you.  Jesus Christ, please.  I've got a few more before that.  Shane, just like the WWF, we're on top of the world, baby.  On top of the world.  Hey, thank you for WrestleMania.  Yeah, we've got to thank you right off the bat.  We had a great time.  Oh, beautiful.  That was great.  Yes.  I didn't see you guys at the after party, though.  No, we weren't invited. 
[01:53:00]  Actually, you were, but you couldn't get in.  Yeah, that was it.  Right.  No, it was all filled up, but we couldn't get through the door.  We had passes and everything.  No, we were hanging low, man.  We didn't want to push it, but we definitely appreciate the trip.  It was great.  It was a great, great time.  We really had a lot of fun.  Good deal.  That's what it's all about.  So how are you going to handle your ass beating on this pay-per-view this Sunday?  Well, first of all, I'm an official, so you're not allowed to put your hands on the official.  Yeah, we've never seen you.  Okay, number one.  Are you going to be cheating as the official Sunday?  No, come on.  You guys know me. 
[01:53:30]  I will be totally impartial, straight down the middle.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.  If you guys hear all this speaker stuff in the background, I'm at our studio right now.  I hear you're in the middle of working out.  Actually, I haven't got to it yet.  I was just about to, you know.  Pumping some iron.  No, actually, I'm about to go run around the ring a little bit and get my wind.  Oh, yeah, so you can run away from whoever is there.  Hey, man, I've got to stay in shape.  I've got to stay in shape running away from everybody.  You know, it's great.  It's been so long since we've seen the classic scene of Shane McMahon running away from Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[01:54:00]  I'm really looking forward to that.  Well, I think things are going to change this time because if Austin gets in the ring, you know, plus, you know, we've got Vinny Mack to counteract Austin right away.  Yeah, and he's always fared so well in front of Stone Cold.  Hey, you know, you forget Vinny Mack and I defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in the ladder match at King of the Ring back in the day of June.  I think Stone Cold couldn't really get traction in the ring because of all your blood.  That might have been a problem.  He's going to have to work on that one. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Let's hope we don't have the same thing happen Sunday.  Actually, that's probably what everyone wants to have happen.  It was great to see Stone Cold last night, man.  Yeah, it was cool.  Yeah, it was, you know, being in the ring and watching that, even though he blew up an expensive vehicle.  Yeah, you guys are really going through the vehicles, man.  Yeah, we stopped at nothing.  Now, are we talking to Shane the character or Shane the man?  Oh, this is, you know, I kind of go in and out.  Yeah, he's both.  All right, could you go into character so I can say something to you?  Sure, go ahead.  Because I don't want to insult you personally. 
[01:55:00]  No problem.  All right, so now I'm talking to the character, Shane.  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  Stephanie's a slut.  You know, I mean, you hear 20,000 screaming that all the time, back and forth, left and right, you know.  Well, what has she really done to deserve that?  You know, I mean, what has she done to deserve that?  Well, Shane, when you go back and remember how she looked, the sweet, innocent sister,  maybe the scene of her all dirty, locked in the boiler room.  Right. 
[01:55:30]  Tied to that demonic symbol that the Undertaker had when he was trying to marry.  And then you look at her now in the short little skirts.  Right.  The little belly shirts.  The super tidy, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you know what I mean.  Running around with the likes of Triple H, I mean, it's kind of different.  So you're saying if the outfit fits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, how is that for an older brother and a father? 
[01:56:00]  I mean, you guys are doing great.  It's very popular.  That's a great story.  I mean, for the love of God, you're standing out there and people are calling your sister a slut.  Some of the signs can't even be repeated.  No, they can't.  No, it's not why I'm out of character again.  So now, it's, well, I almost said a profanity there.  It's hard.  It's tough.  I guess.  You know, it's just like, you look over and you see all these, you know, like you say,  you can't even repeat some of the stuff out there.  Yeah.  And you're just like, oh, my God.  I saw one yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  It was awful.  You know, it said, Steph Swallows.  Oh, my God.  And I'm sitting there and I go, God damn.  I go, jeez.  See, people, the sound is good.  It is brutal.  And I'm sitting there and I go, God.  You know, I wanted to jump over there and beat the hell out of this kid.  Yeah, sure.  You know.  Man, I have a younger sister.  I mean, if a guy looked at her wrong, we would beat him up.  Oh, I know.  You got to weigh it, I guess, with how hard it is to look at and how popular it is. 
[01:57:00]  I mean, people love calling our names.  Oh, yeah.  They love that.  And how is she doing with all that?  I guess she's doing okay.  Yeah?  It doesn't get to her?  No.  I don't think anything ever.  Well, put a pair of panties on and get out there.  Right.  Is your father, has he suggested any things to her that she's gone, look, Dad, you're  out of your frigging mind?  No.  No, as far as storylines go?  No, she's crazy.  She's just as crazy as he is. 
[01:57:30]  And are some of the writers afraid to approach your father with some of these ideas?  No, it's me.  Oh, really?  They approach you with this stuff?  Oh, yeah.  They circumvent me.  I come in, I go, what are you guys out of your mind?  You know, I get all physical.  I'm tough in the back.  All right, Shane, we got an idea.  A double-dung dildo match.  Lovely.  Shane, put that down.  That's good.  Very fun.  We're looking forward to...  It'd be better if it was on a pole.  A double-dung dildo match. 
[01:58:00]  You've got to work towards it.  You've got to work towards it and use it against your opponent.  Put in Rikishi.  There you go.  It might get lost.  Man, how do the guys deal with that?  What, Rikishi?  Oh, my God.  You've got to sit there.  Hold your breath.  It's called the stink face.  That's what it's called in the locker.  Stink face.  Because you guys in the back must be just laughing your ass off.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  And then you're just like, hey, watch.  And sometimes Rikishi will do it, and you won't know what's coming.  Oh, great.  And you can't do a thing about it. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, he's 400-something pounds.  The best was Pete Rose getting it at WrestleMania.  Pete did a great job.  Yeah, he did.  Pete comes back year after year for the abuse.  It is so damn funny.  He loves it.  He loves it.  But he goes, oh, man, no more chokeslam.  He goes, that's out.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he didn't like that.  He was holding his head in the back.  He had a big ice pack.  He goes, and that pass.  He had a big answer.  He goes, oh.  I was just like, damn.  I'd be scrubbing my face. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, man.  And, of course, at WrestleMania, the ladder match, again.  Oh, insane.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  I mean, all three of those teams are just amazing.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to give it up to the Dudleys, though.  They're Long Island boys.  You've got to get props there.  Yeah, I've heard he hangs out at a lot of the same strip clubs we do.  Oh, yeah?  It's kind of cool.  We just haven't bumped into them yet.  The Dudley boys are my favorites now.  The Dudleys are insane.  Man, they picked up some heat.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Like, I didn't think they were really going to take off at first.  Yeah, when you get the 3D action going, and then, you know, they take on TNA. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Trish Stratus.  Hello.  Showing.  Oh, I was just about to mention that.  And I'm holding the Raw magazine where you've got all the girls in their bikini layouts.  Eva.  Oh, wow.  I've got about, right?  Trish is unbelievable.  Yeah, I'm trying to convince the writers to write me into a nice story with that, but I keep getting shot down.  Yeah, you're a smart man.  Give me a storyline with the J.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  You don't have much pull yet.  Come on.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  That should have happened immediately. 
[02:00:00]  Okay.  Now, obviously, everybody's speculating.  The Rock and Stone Cold, no one sees any love there.  I don't see any love.  So, I'm thinking this Sunday we're going to see somebody turn.  Payback.  Payback.  Could be payback.  Could be.  You know, do we see another WrestleMania?  Did anyone call that one negative?  Thank you very much.  Negative.  One for McMahon.  Check.  I think everyone turns on Triple H Sunday.  I think it's time. 
[02:00:30]  I think it's time to boot him out of the game.  Oh, you guys went the other way.  You're thinking.  I think it's time.  I never know.  I always think I haven't figured out, and you screw me.  Yeah, you guys do have some great writers, because there are times I'm convinced I know  what's going to happen.  Just like Dan said, you screw us over and go, God, they went the other way.  It's fun.  You've got to give a lot of the credit to the talent, too, because a lot of the ideas are  theirs also.  So, it's a complete, it is a team.  It's a team effort, and that's how we all pull it off and entertain. 
[02:01:00]  We just want the best possible product out there, so we take it from everyone.  So, kudos to everyone, and it's really a pleasure to work with it.  It's so much fun.  Yeah, it's a pisser to watch, man.  Yeah, go ahead, Shane.  Sorry.  No, there's no problem.  I mean, you guys are living your dream.  You guys are doing exactly what you want to do.  Yeah.  You know, and that's what all of us there, we get to do, too.  So, it's awesome.  Yeah, but you guys catch beatings on a daily basis.  Yeah, definitely the hazard pay needs to come into effect.  You're insane getting into the mix like that. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know what the hell, you know.  Obviously, your family, very well off in this business.  It worked hard, built up WWF to the point where, you know, you guys are comfortable, I'm sure.  I don't think you need to be throwing yourself off of the top rope onto floors.  Having people throw you over the top rope onto the floor.  Yeah, we've seen the aftermath firsthand.  We had an old superstar in the studio recently.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was a mistake.  Brutal, huh? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, where's the little sound clip we have of him?  See if you can identify this.  Who is this guy?  Who is this?  Ouch.  Ouch.  Did you hear that?  One more time.  Ouch.  It's one word.  It's kind of rough.  Maybe you could give him this.  All right, hold on.  Listen to this clip.  Okay, brother.  Do you hear that?  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Who is that?  Well, you do it one more time.  Okay.  Okay, brother.  Did you hear it that time?  No.  Oh, all right.  Hold on.  Okay, brother.  I talked over it that time.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  One more time.  Here it is.  Okay, brother.  Is that Jimmy?  Yeah.  It's Jimmy.  The super fly.  The super fly.  Super fly.  Oh, my God.  And I hope you're using softer canvas these days when those boys are jumping off the top 
[02:03:00]  rope.  Oh, man.  Maybe you should hit each other on the back of the head with pillows.  Oh, brutal.  One of the funniest things is everyone always asks, oh, my God.  How do you guys, where do you guys get those chairs?  You know, it looks like it hurts.  Yeah.  Pick up a chair, pick up a steel chair and swing it at about 70 miles an hour and connect  with someone's skull.  That's what's going on.  That's it.  All right.  A lot of people asking questions, Shane.  I'll give you a few here real fast. 
[02:03:30]  Undertaker, what's going on?  Undertaker's rehabbing.  He tore his peck off.  His pecker?  Uh-oh.  What'd you do?  Hello?  Shane, sorry about that.  No problem.  Say that again?  You guys haven't got that console fix since the last time.  I know, I know.  It's a mess, man.  It's a mess around here.  It was brutal.  Sorry.  He was playing.  All right.  So he pulled his...  He tore a peck off the bone.  You know, he was training.  And it put him out.  It put him way out.  First, it was hip, and then he tore his peck on his way back.  But Undertaker, he's doing fabulous.  His rehab's going very well. 
[02:04:00]  So he's in there every day doing, you know, physical rehabilitation and getting stronger.  And he's so pumped to come back.  You know, he's just dying.  But he should be back, you know, pretty soon.  Now, we saw Shawn Michaels at the hotel during WrestleMania.  HBK, yeah.  Yeah, he wasn't involved in anything.  Is he coming back for anything?  You know, we always reserve that right to do.  You know, Shawn's a tremendous talent.  Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday.  Unfortunately, I don't think...  The only time we'll ever see Shawn Michaels in the ring is via videotape, which is a shame. 
[02:04:30]  Because he was truly, you know, you can call him the Michael Jordan of our business.  He was just phenomenal with everything he did.  You know, so I'm a big Shawn fan.  But, you know, unfortunately, all those bumps have taken a huge toll on his back.  And, you know, he's a family man now.  Just had a baby boy.  Yeah, we saw him pushing around a little stroller outside of the hotel.  That's what he's focused on.  And so we're real happy for him.  But Shawn has so many things to, you know, still offer the WWF and himself and his family. 
[02:05:00]  There's tons of stuff for him to do.  Okay.  Cool.  And Mankind, obviously, everyone's asking about.  Nick's chilling at home.  He's in Florida right now.  Another Long Island boy, by the way.  Yeah.  So he's just hanging out in Florida and kind of, you know, recouping.  You know, he's the oldest 34-year-old in the business.  Yeah, you know, because he, I mean, talking about self-mutilation, he is just, he did it all.  You know, he just gets that charge from the fans. 
[02:05:30]  And he just, I mean, you guys have seen him.  Yeah.  Just threw his body out there.  And caution to the wind, he takes it to a new level.  So Mick's healing.  He's retired, you know, for now.  And who knows?  You know, there's other things for Mick to do.  Will he ever return to the ring?  Possibly.  He can't stay away.  You know.  He's coming back eventually.  Yeah, I think so.  Hey, any other family members out there that you're going to bring into the ring?  Your mom out there is great.  Yeah.  It's so fun to watch over the time that they've all been getting a lot more exposure. 
[02:06:00]  Their acting getting a little better.  You know, their personalities changing and stuff.  Because I'll tell you something.  Stephanie had to have been the worst actress I've ever seen when she first came on board.  Was that changed?  Well, you know something?  It has changed.  The slut thing fits her better.  And don't take that wrong.  Don't take that wrong.  But she plays it off better.  Right.  Than the innocent girl.  Right.  And your mom is just hysterical.  The faces she makes when she's got to slap you kids around.  That's her.  That's her.  That's what's the beauty of it. 
[02:06:30]  It's so funny.  I mean, that's her.  Yeah.  You know, it's easy.  Anyone else, though, out there?  Are there any other McMahons in the wings?  Sure.  There are other family members.  Yeah?  Sure.  Bring them out?  Possibility.  Yeah.  You know, I've got a half-brother.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We'll see.  All right.  Shit.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I've got a crazy cousin.  I don't know.  They're also asking about Mr. Ass.  Mr. Ass really tore his rotator cuff right out of his shoulder.  He just landed on all of his weight. 
[02:07:00]  So he'll be out probably another three months.  All right.  And is Shamrock coming back?  I don't know what's up with Kenny.  Yeah.  I know Kenny's training right now for a shoot fight in Japan.  So that's what Ken Shamrock's been doing.  I believe it's coming up soon.  Oh, kook.  Yeah.  But we'll never see it over in this country because I guess it's outlawed.  Yeah.  Yes.  Which is ridiculous, but we won't go into that.  And a lot of people are asking about The Rock.  Is he taking some time off to film that movie? 
[02:07:30]  Yes, but only like a week.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  A lot of people thought he was going away for like a few months.  I'm like, no, no.  Negative.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Negative.  Can't let that happen.  All right.  You know, we like to pick on The Rock too much.  That's true.  You know?  But, I mean, he'll be making that movie not as the WWF champion, I assure you.  Mm-hmm.  No.  That's great.  Yee!  I'm pumped for Sunday.  I am.  I'm psyched.  Yeah.  I'm very excited.  I cannot wait to watch it, Shane.  You know, just, I mean, to give you guys kind of an insider perspective, just to be in 
[02:08:00]  there and the energy when you've got rock on one side and Triple H and then you've got  Austin on the outside.  Oh, and that glass breaks and he comes out there.  Oh, it's going to be insane.  And you can't help, I wish I can describe it or someone can get that rush.  If you can bottle that rush, it'd be a huge seller.  Yeah.  Yeah, it'd be phenomenal because the goosebumps just go straight up your back on your arms  and everything and you just, you can't help but feel that electricity just permeating through  your body, just boom, boom. 
[02:08:30]  It's insane.  That's cool.  You know, and then especially, you know, when I'm on top of him beating the hell out of  him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just like this.  I'm like, yeah, I'm the man, baby.  Shane, wake up.  Wake up, Shane.  Right.  You're napping.  Uh-huh.  Hey, I'm faster than he is.  Thank God.  I'm faster than most people.  That's what keeps me alive.  Yeah, thank God.  Really?  You could run up that ramp fast.  I can run, baby.  I can run.  All right.  All right, Shane.  Looking forward to the pay-per-view this Sunday.  Beautiful.  Very excited.  Check it out.  A little backlash for you. 
[02:09:00]  Backlash.  You know, again, guys, congratulations to you.  Becoming number one.  Thank you.  You know, you guys should have been there a long time ago.  Yeah.  You know, but hey, record pace.  All right.  Keep it rolling.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Shane.  Later, guys.  We'll talk to you soon.  Bye.  Shane McMahon, everyone.  Shane O'Mac.  That went well.  See?  See?  He didn't hang up on us.  That's good.  That was a fun interview on the phone with one of our friends, Shane McMahon.  Yeah, he's always been cool to us.  Yeah.  Him and his father.  We've got to get Vince back in here.  He's just hilarious.  Vince McMahon of the WWF. 
[02:09:30]  Over the top.  Mark downstairs.  My daughter, a crotchless panty match.  Let's go to Mark real fast.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm downstairs in front of the Brooklyn Diner here with tons of wow stickers.  All right.  Anyone's in the neighborhood, welcome, more than welcome to come by and grab a few.  No one's trying to chew you down for more stickers, are they?  No one has chewed me down yet.  Yeah.  We've got the brand new wow stickers in this week.  We're very proud of them.  And Psycho Mark is outside the building, 57th and 7th, right in front of the Brooklyn Diner 
[02:10:00]  with a bunch of wow stickers.  You'll be there for a little while?  Yeah, I'll be here for at least a half hour, 45 minutes, maybe even longer.  Who knows?  A lot of people just stopping by or what?  Yeah, there's actually a few guys that are waiting down here for like the last half hour.  It took me a while to get down here.  They're still waiting.  So I gave them a few stickers.  They're all set.  All right, man.  And more people showing up.  Cool.  Have fun.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  There's two other ways to get your wow sticker, and then we'll take a break.  Then we'll get back into the Ben Stein thing, and we'll also get back into Spaz's Week in Review, 
[02:10:30]  which we blew off an hour ago already.  Yeah, I know.  Boy, the things that have been happening here.  All right.  So if you want to get a wow sticker, yeah, downstairs with Psycho Mark for a little longer,  Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  He's there right now.  Or you could stop by Ranch 1, Anthony.  Ranch 1.  There's Ranch 1s all over the tri-state area.  They got their wow stickers today.  Okay?  Just go into the one nearest you and ask for the wow sticker.  They're not out on display because, you know, they know our listeners and that you'll take 100 or 200 for yourself. 
[02:11:00]  So just be nice to the guy behind the counter and say, hey, I'm here for the Opie and Anthony wow sticker.  Okay?  Right.  And if you can't get to a Ranch 1 location, you're maybe too far away or there's just not one in your neighborhood,  just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the station and we'll send you a wow sticker in the mail.  We're getting tons of these in every day, which is pretty cool.  The address, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106.  And just write attention wow sticker or something on there. 
[02:11:30]  Okay?  And if you need that address, I do believe it's on WNEW.com or the unofficial Opie and Anthony website,  which is FoundryMusic.com.  Foundry.  A lot of info there.  I apologize.  Coming back with the Ben Stein thing.  Ben Stein decided to hang up on us, I don't know, about 45 minutes ago.  And if you missed it, stay right there.  We'll explain the whole thing next.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Hi, this is Vince McMahon of the WWF. 
[02:12:00]  And I'm here to tell you, it doesn't get any more raw than Opie and Anthony.  Raw!  On 1027 WNEW, the stone cold rock of New York.  WNEW, the stone cold.  Hi, this is Vince McMahon of the WWF.  And my daughter's a hose bag.  It's nice to have the WWF back on our side, Anthony.  Yeah, making enemies every damn day on this damn radio show.  Yeah, we can't alienate everybody, you know. 
[02:12:30]  It's nice to be on the same side as the WWF.  They have their pay-per-view Sunday.  Backlash, it looks like it's going to be a good one.  I'm excited for it.  With the return of stone cold Steve Austin.  Even though we had our problems with the WWF, we never went on to the dark side.  I hope they realize that.  Yes, exactly.  See?  Because there's another wrestling organization that knew that we were in. 
[02:13:00]  But I'm just trying to figure out if they're recording over something that we wanted to play.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  What I wanted to say, because I know the WWF people listen, Anthony.  Yeah.  When things got ugly between us and the WWF, there was another fine, not a fine, but another wrestling league that came knocking, looking for the opportunity.  Came knocking, thought they would take advantage of the fact that we weren't getting along.  And what did we say to that organization, Anthony? 
[02:13:30]  Nine?  No.  See ya.  Your product sucks.  I mean, if you're going to pick an organization, I mean a wrestling organization to be with, it might as well be the one that people watch.  If we're not going to be friends with them, then we're just not going to befriend any wrestling organization.  There you go.  Okay.  Well, what a crazy, crazy show this has become once again today, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  Like today would be different. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know what it is.  There's this aura that this show has now that is just bringing out the friggin' lunatics.  Well, you know, a lot of people want us to start interviewing, you know, more celebrities and stuff.  And on a daily basis, you should see the people we turn down, because we know they just don't know how to play the Opie and Anthony game.  They blow.  They blow.  They have an agenda.  They don't want to have fun.  They think, you know, they think it's going to, you know, suck, so they don't try. 
[02:14:30]  There are certain people that can walk through that door, sit down, and become part of this show.  The prime example, of course, obvious Jay Moore.  He walked in here and never left.  Right.  But he gets the show.  Jim Brewer walks in, understands the show.  Very funny.  We love him.  Louis Black can come in and just, we can keep talking about what we're talking about.  No problem.  Jon Stewart.  Right, same thing.  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yeah.  Now, love him or hate Andrew Dice Clay, the guy does well on this show. 
[02:15:00]  He understands what we do.  He has fun with us.  There you go.  And I challenge anyone to try to find another piece of radio that was funnier than when Andrew Dice Clay was on this week.  That was really good.  It was unbelievable stuff.  See, he knows how to deal with it.  So, we go through a list of people that call this show and want to get on to plug their stuff or whatever it is.  And we go, no, no, no, no, no.  We know this one isn't going to be good. 
[02:15:30]  Because you could tell.  Now, Ben Stein.  We figure, what the hell?  Comedy Central, we have a good relationship with them.  They give us some fun guests that we've had on this program.  So, we'll throw him a bomb.  He does the show with Jimmy Kimmel.  We have Kimmel on.  He does well.  We figure, if anything, you know, we'll talk about when he was a speech writer for Nixon back in the 60s, smoking dope, whatever the hell he was doing.  I don't know.  So, we figure we'll throw him a bomb.  He gets on about, what, an hour ago? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  And right after we were doing a commercial where, I guess I said, people will be on the phone when you're trying to sell your car and try to chew down the price.  Chew down the price.  That's what I said.  It's the car cash commercial.  Try to chew down the price.  That's exactly what you said.  Yep.  We got the tape.  We have a ton of our listeners as witnesses.  We get Ben Stein is on hold at this point.  Hey, we're guilty for saying some really stupid stuff on this show.  But, God damn.  You know, I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm a choir boy or anything. 
[02:16:30]  We are definitely guilty for saying some stuff.  And we don't care about that stuff either.  But we don't like being accused of something that we didn't do.  Because he was convinced you said chew down.  And then when you explain yourself, then he was trying to, like, cover his ass and say, well, it's too close.  It sounds like it.  And if it sounds like it, people are going to think it is it.  I'm a douche bag.  Oh, win Ben Stein's colon. 
[02:17:00]  So, he's on hold during the commercial.  I say chew down the price.  He starts up.  The first thing out of his mouth is he's got this attitude that how could, you know, did I just hear someone say, chew down the price?  I said, no, no.  I said, chew.  Chew.  And then you explain yourself.  And then he just rambles on it, making no sense.  We got the tape.  I started laughing because I thought he was making, you know, a joke.  I thought it was so insane it had to be a joke.  No one could possibly be this serious about something sounding like something. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  So, real fast, let's play, like, only 15 seconds of the commercial.  Car Cash.  Yeah.  We love Car Cash.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  Yep.  Where Anthony was explaining, you know, what Car Cash does and used the term, chew, C-H-E-W, down.  Chew down.  Right.  Here it is.  Three in the morning, you're getting calls from people.  God forbid there's a misprint in the paper.  All of a sudden, your Corvette is being sold for 20 bucks. 
[02:18:00]  And you're getting calls at all hours from people.  It's a big pain in the ass.  And then the person that comes over the house and tries to chew down the value of your car,  and he's looking underneath saying, well, it seems to be something with the item on the muffler bearing.  There it is.  Try to chew down the price of your car, as in nibbling away at the price.  Oh.  So, right after the commercial, we get back into the show, and Ben Stein is on our hotline. 
[02:18:30]  He was on hold, so he heard the commercial on his phone.  But right now, we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi, how are you?  There he is.  Okay.  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price of a car?  No, he said chew down.  You just said chew down.  Oh, that's a lot different.  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben.  Okay.  And you being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before  we talked to Ben Stein.  Talk to Ben Stein.  I see.  You sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do.  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism. 
[02:19:30]  Well, it's a term that is used, chew, not chew.  I wouldn't have said chew down.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  And anybody who's listening to it is going to know you're saying chew down with a tiny,  tiny chain.  Oh, my God.  It sounds like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Ben, are you this insane? 
[02:20:00]  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or chew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  Hung up on like Ben Stein.  People are going to know that you said Jew.  No, they're not going to know I said Jew because I didn't, you idiot.  How can he try to turn that around?  You said chew, but people are going to know you said Jew.  Ben, how are they going to know I said something I didn't say, you frigging lunatic idiot? 
[02:20:30]  Uh, Carol, what's going on?  I got a complaint.  Yeah.  I'm offended.  All right.  Did he just say car gash?  Yes, Carol.  No, it was cash, but sounded like gash, not offensive to all women.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right, Carol.  All right.  Take care.  The man lost his mind sometime back in the frigging 70s working with Nixon.  Where's Ben Stein?  Where's the Jew?  Well, everyone knows Richard Nixon, big anti-Semite. 
[02:21:00]  I had to deal with Henry Kissinger and that Jew Ben Stein.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, you're not going to try to Jew me down.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Frank.  Where's Liddy?  I'm only going to pay him so much to break into the hotel.  I don't want Liddy trying to Jew me down like Ben Stein.  I'm only paying him so much for speeches.  He keeps trying to Jew me down.  Hi, Frank.  The guy's a madman. 
[02:21:30]  Hey.  Hey, you know, he's a hypocrite.  If he's going to be this super sensitive, bear with me here a second.  John Mitchell, another Jew.  Don't you think he could misinterpret the whole point of his show as being an anti-Semitic stereotype?  Explain.  What's that?  Go ahead, explain.  Well, try to win money from a Jewish man who's traditionally stereotypically cheap?  Yeah, his whole show is based on the fact that it's his personal money.  Yeah.  And he will do anything in his power to keep from giving you one buck. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  So you have to beat him in this game show format to win my money, which I will defend like a Jew.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, and he hates giving it away.  When people win, he gets all upset.  Boy, really busting down those stereotypes.  I guess it's okay when they put the check in your pocket.  The other stereotype, you know, the stereotype is that all Jewish people are well-educated.  They're people, the book, the whole thing. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Why did they pick him?  Because are they playing on that stereotype?  Why doesn't he get mad at Comedy Central?  Well, you know, you've got to give the guy something.  He does know a lot.  Oh, he's extremely intelligent.  He comes off as very intelligent on the show.  In real life, on the phone, he comes off like a nutcase.  How the hell do you get upset because something sounds like something else?  That is so friggin' dangerous.  We're reaching a point in this country where you can't even say stuff that sounds like something else.  Oh, my God.  Hey, now it sounds like something that sounded like something. 
[02:23:00]  Utter a word and get your head chopped off.  Oh, my God.  He's a hypocrite.  That's all he is.  He's a hypocrite.  All right, guys, take it easy.  Thank you, Frank.  You won't have Richard Nixon to kick around anymore, you Jews.  I had to deal with Kissinger for many years.  Always trying to Jew me down.  Hey, Rob.  Checkers.  Come here, Checkers, boy.  Checkers.  Checkers.  He's my watchdog.  He watches for Jews and Spades coming on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
[02:23:30]  Jesus.  That's good.  Rob, what's up?  Depends out of his mind.  Rob, what's up?  You're on the air.  Let's go.  You worked with the biggest national semis.  Hey, Rob.  Hey.  Rob.  Go fly a kite.  Is there something...  I mean kite.  Is there something wrong with these phones today?  Rob.  Douchebag on the phone with us.  He ain't listening.  Loser. 
[02:24:00]  Ron.  Rob.  Hello.  Ralph.  Bob.  He's right there.  I can...  Are you saying that Rob might be Jewish and doesn't want to listen to you, or he might  miss an opportunity to turn a buck?  That's anti-Semitism.  Let's see if...  Paige.  Hey, Paige.  What's up?  Where's my daughter, Chrissie?  Nothing.  I wanted to just...  Hope she doesn't marry a Jew.  No, no, no.  I wanted to just really agree with you.  I think you're absolutely right, and it's just a prime example that he should totally 
[02:24:30]  not do your type of a show.  Yeah.  I think he's an idiot.  You sound well-educated, Paige.  Paige, are you one of those high mees?  No.  No.  Totally not.  Unbelievable.  That's it.  Thank you, Paige.  Okay.  Unbelievable.  Sam says that Stein had the right to be offended.  I want to hear this one.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Sam.  Yo, yo.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good. 
[02:25:00]  Okay.  First of all, when I was listening, the only thing that was going through my head when Anthony  said, chew down, is like, huh, never heard that phrase before.  But then, I go to my mom, and I ask her, you know, is there anything wrong with the  expression, chew down?  She goes, you mean, chew down.  Tough.  There is no expression, chew down.  There absolutely is an expression, chew down the price.  If there is, you made it up, man.  Totally didn't.  Oh, my God.  I've used that one before.  I'm not, where do you guys get it from?  I've used both terms before.  I'm not going to lie.  I've heard that since I was a kid.  I've heard, yeah, I've heard both of them. 
[02:25:30]  Jew down, chew down.  I've used both of them.  Does, will you at least agree that it makes complete sense to chew down a price?  For sure.  I mean, it clicked right as soon as you said it.  I've just never heard it before.  And somebody who's only heard one will assume you meant the other.  So, I'm just saying, don't be too hard on it.  Well, then, when you explain it to somebody, and they say, just because it sounds like it,  there's a problem.  Well, it sounds like you're covering your tracks, man.  You know what I mean?  Oh, please.  Well, I'm not speaking for my...  Oh, please.  Sam, Sam.  Yes.  He was clear as day on the tape, and said, chew. 
[02:26:00]  He didn't say, chew.  And he explained that to Ben, and Ben decided to hang up, because he's a little crybaby.  Well, obviously, he's quite deaf, because he couldn't hear, you know, Jimmy Kimmel saying  kite and kite, so you can't really blame him for that, either.  He's an old, sensitive old man.  Win the stick up Ben Stein's ass.  The new game show.  Oh, man, I want to play that one.  It's pretty big.  All right, but you guys are the greatest.  I hold no offense against you guys.  All right, man.  All right?  I can't accept that. 
[02:26:30]  I cannot agree with that, at all.  There is absolutely a term to chew down a price.  You're chewing it down.  As you're talking, you're nibbling down, and trying to get the price down.  I've heard it since I was a kid.  A long short would chew down.  I didn't use that.  And I don't care what it sounds like, Ben Stein.  Jew down isn't even offensive to me.  It's not.  Jesus.  Stephen.  Stephen.  Stephen.  Or whoever your name is. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  This?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steve.  All I want to do is defend.  Number one, I heard chew down, and I've heard chew down for 40 years of my life.  Right.  How stupid do you have to be?  Isolate that.  To be on the phone, and someone calls your name, and you don't answer. 
[02:27:30]  And you guys think Spaz is stupid.  What do you, who do you think we were talking to?  Well, you said David, and I said my name was Stephen.  No, we said Stephen.  Do we have to play that?  Okay, all right.  I, I apologize.  Let me just get this point.  Call a radio show.  The point is, chew down.  It's not offensive.  It's, it's.  Enough, man.  I've had it.  Opie's cursing like, like, like a sailor. 
[02:28:00]  Holy cow.  Where's Archibald Cox?  That Jew.  We almost ran out of delay.  We did.  How's, I, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,  Yeah.  It amazes me that you, you.  Even though it's a show, people, it works just like your phone at home.  See, you, you're on the phone.  You wait until someone says hello, or your name or something, and then you start talking. 
[02:28:30]  Pay no attention to what's coming out of your radio speaker.  And, and then there are times, okay, they, they get your name wrong, but if you hear us  saying hi to you through your receiver, that's the person we're talking to.  We're talking to you.  Yeah, Spaz finally got a name right.  The guy's name was Steven.  We said Steven.  He was the a-hole.  Whoa.  Oh.  Opie, Valium's for everyone. 
[02:29:00]  Pass him out.  He's melting.  Deal him out.  I'm proving I'm not on the, the, the big V.  Lame excuse, Ant.  You meant Jew down.  Let's get real.  You know, if that's what you want to think, fine, go F yourself.  It doesn't.  If I would have, if I wanted to say Jew down, I'd have said it.  I've said it before.  Yes.  Oh.  See, that person is off the rocker, too, because it's not, it's not about, you know, us, us  saying crazy stuff, because we do all the time. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  But don't accuse us, accuse us of something that we did not say.  Ben Stein.  Search out true anti-Semitism.  Leave the fake stuff alone.  You got to jerk off.  Oh.  I'm never watching that show.  Never did.  Questions are too hard.  Eh, whatever.  He got burned again.  Let me try and do someone a favor.  They know who they are.  And I'm very pissed off.  Yeah, where is he? 
[02:30:00]  Trust me, we don't need Ben Stein for, to keep this show successful.  Uh-huh.  Uh, excuse me, Mr. President.  I thought you said Jew.  I did.  I said cheap Jew.  Write that into a speech, Ben.  Cheap Jew.  It'll get, we'll make friends with the Arabs and get the oil.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  All right, Mr. President.  As long as you pay me.  I don't care.  As long as I'm making my money.  Good, good, Jaime, Ben.  You're one of my favorite Jews.  Along with Hank Kissinger.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Boney?  Hey.  I'm Jewish, man.  And that's him. 
[02:31:00]  I mean, most Jews are cheap.  You're right.  Oh.  I'm not even going to get into that.  I'm just stating what I said.  That's it.  Oh, you don't do anything wrong.  I know.  That's him.  You've got to tell me.  Check off.  All right, man.  All right.  Syndication on the ground.  Yes.  There you go.  There you go.  Later.  Oh, my head is spinning from today.  I need some Manischewans.  AJ from Long Island.  Yes.  Chew down is a real expression.  From the web.  The salesman will try talking to you in terms of monthly payments, but you need to switch 
[02:31:30]  him back to total price of the car in order to chew him down.  Of course, it's common frigging knowledge that's used all the time.  Eat me.  Eat me, Ben Stein.  Suck it.  Okay.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm still downstairs here.  You're still downstairs?  Yep.  Hanging out stickers right here in front of the Brooklyn Diner. 
[02:32:00]  Great.  Take those Wow stickers and shove them up your ass.  What a cranky-ass mood everyone's in today.  And, boy, we just needed some ass wipe to come on and give us crap today.  Wow.  Ben Stein just is setting the entertainment world on fire.  Oh, what a depressing F he is.  All right, Mark.  Well, Mark's downstairs with the Wow stickers, 57th and 7th, outside the Brooklyn Diner.  Get them before you go home today, okay?  Thank you, Mark.  Okay.  Mr. President, we're going to have to write you a speech about the bombing of Cambodia. 
[02:32:30]  Who cares about those little chinks, Ben?  We don't care about them.  Let's all get naked with Henry Kissinger and form a daisy chain.  Okay.  How much?  Very good.  Hey, Ben, you want to hear a good one? 
[02:33:00]  Okay, Mr. President.  What's the object of a football game?  Of a Jew football game?  I don't know, Mr. President.  What is it?  To get the quarterback.  Get it?  Get it, Ben?  Ha, ha, ha.  Very funny, Mr. President.  Yeah.  Funny, because you're a Jew.  Write me a speech. 
[02:33:30]  Write me a speech about Anwar Sadat.  You're a Jew.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ben.  How do you fit a hundred Jews in a Volkswagen?  I don't know, Mr. President.  How?  You throw a penny in.  See?  Because you're a chief.  All you Jews. 
[02:34:00]  Henry found them.  He knew that joke.  Hey, Ben.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Yes, Mr. President.  They own it.  See?  Because they own everything.  Oh, it's a lead-up.  You're my favorite Jaime speech writer, Ben. 
[02:34:30]  I like being surrounded by Jews.  Ben Stein.  Henry Kissinger.  The Jewish people are probably the ones that use the term chew down,  because they don't want to say Jew down.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Hi, Bill.  What's up?  Yo.  Hey.  You knew your name.  Great.  Jesus.  We're making points.  Hey, man.  Congratulations.  Number one. 
[02:35:00]  Thank you.  Hey, don't you guys think the term chew down came from chew down  because somebody decided to get a little, you know, creative, whatever?  Probably.  I don't know.  I mean, come on.  What's wrong with these people?  There's no such term.  Bullshit.  Okay.  Very good.  Nice save.  Let's get a word expert on the phone.  All right, man.  Someone that knows the origins of words, Anthony.  Hey, Ben.  Here's another one.  Knock, knock.  Who's there, Mr. President?  Jew. 
[02:35:30]  Jew who?  You.  You're a Jew.  I'm still working on that one.  Maybe you can write it for me, Ben.  You're my speechwriter.  Do you have a nice day?  Ha, ha.  Very funny, Mr. President.  Where's my paycheck?  I'll write for the biggest Annie semi.  Albeit, laugh your balls off in the kitchen. 
[02:36:00]  I'm over here now.  I'm lying over here.  I'm lying over here.  Where's Liddy?  He's no Jew.  But I misused his character.  Hey, it was Dick Nixon saying it.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Ben Stein chewed me out.  Yes, he did.  Oh, that's a word, isn't it?  Okay, listen.  Let's get back into Spaz's Week in Review.  Oh, my God.  I forgot.  Jeez.  We were in the middle of that before all hell broke loose about an hour and a half ago.  So, all right?  Stick around.  Trust me.  You're going to be entertained when you find out where Spaz thinks where the prostate is.  Excuse me.  Yes.  Yes.  What are you, an idiot? 
[02:37:00]  All right, listen.  We got that.  Let's regroup, Anthony.  Regroup.  Pull back.  Ben, write me a speech of how to get our boys out of Vietnam.  Get them away from those little chinks and back here with the Jews where they belong.  How come there's only darkies fighting for our country, Ben, and no Jews? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, my God.  O.P. and Anthony.  Wow.  1027 WNEW.  Hello?  Uh, uh, hold on, man.  I'm checking out Methods of Mayhem.  Hey.  This is terrible.  I don't like the singing, but that riff is kind of cool.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  What's up, man? 
[02:38:00]  I'm on 6th Avenue right now on West 16th Street.  Just walked out of Ranch 1.  Asked for a wow sticker.  Guy behind the counter looks at me like I'm insane.  It says, no, we don't have that.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Now there's going to be a problem.  All right.  Here we go.  Battle, Battle Station.  And 16th Street.  I walked out of work.  I'm like, cool.  I go to Ranch 1 right now on my way home.  Get a sticker or whatever.  All right.  And he looks at me like I'm insane.  It says, no, we don't have that.  Oh, God.  Really?  Battle Station.  Battle Station.  Shut up. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  It's going to be us against the world again, Anthony, like the old days.  I love it.  God, it was good feeling good for a day, wasn't it?  Yes.  Maybe I'll try one a few blocks down.  All right.  They're running into the studio.  They're panicking, and they want me to read the following.  Wow sticker's now available at participating Ranch 1 locations.  Oh, participating?  Just ask for your Wow sticker, because they don't have them on display.  You have to ask for them.  Well, you figure I'm in Manhattan, the show's in Manhattan, walking to a Ranch 1 in Manhattan,  you figure that would happen.  Mike, I want you to go to another Ranch 1 location. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  And you let me know if they have any Wow stickers.  Okay.  There's one about three blocks down.  I want everyone right now to go into a Ranch 1 location.  Yeah.  And I'm going to find out exactly who has the Wow stickers and who doesn't.  Listen, help me.  We have to make sure there are indeed participating locations.  Yes.  That's what I want to make sure.  If there's a couple that don't have them, okay, I understand, because that's what participating  Ranch 1 locations means.  But if there's only a couple that have them.  Right. 
[02:39:30]  So, so far, the one on 6th Avenue does not have the Wow stickers.  You know what might be a good thing?  If maybe they could display a Wow sticker somewhere so that people that walk in don't even have  to ask to find out if they have them.  They could see one and go, oh, this must be a participating location.  All right.  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, how are you doing?  Hey, guys.  Doing good.  How are you doing?  All right.  Stopped to the Ranch 1 in Brooklyn on Court Street, and they said, nope, they don't have  me either. 
[02:40:00]  There's two.  0 for 2 so far.  0 for 2 on the stickers.  We are working.  I have to explain to them what they were.  They kept asking, what does Wow mean?  Okay.  This is good.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Let's go to Mike.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike.  Hey, what's happening?  We've been announcing all day that the Ranch 1 stores have the Wow stickers.  Mike, what can you tell us?  Well, basically, I walk in, and I ask for a Wow sticker.  The guy looks at me like I'm stupid.  And, psych, of course they don't have any Wow stickers. 
[02:40:30]  Half the people out there are a bunch of idiots falling for that scam.  Give me a break.  Bye.  What?  So, Mike, you were trying to abuse us over the Wow promotion, I'm assuming?  I'm just calling you out on your scam.  Give me a break.  Only an idiot is going to go into Ranch 1 looking for a Wow sticker.  You are calling us out on what scam, Mike?  I'm going to try to understand what you're trying to say.  So, let me try to understand, if you took these Wow stickers to all the Ranch 1s, is that how they got their hands on them?  Why would we piss off our listeners by making them go into a store to get something that's not there? 
[02:41:00]  It's like a joke.  Yeah, and that would piss off listeners.  Why would we do that?  I don't think so.  I mean, everybody knows the game.  It's only good fun, but nowadays they probably feel a little stupid after they come out of the Ranch 1.  Why would we do a joke that's that stupid?  Mike, how come you can't say which Ranch 1s have the Wow stickers?  Mike, we are going to talk to our listeners, okay?  Okay, so you should hang up now.  All right, put Spaz and Psycho Mark on the phone and saying that they got them. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's not what we do either on the show, you ass.  Uh-huh.  Okay, Mike.  Where can I get one of these so-called Wow stickers from one of these Ranch 1s?  Which Ranch 1 has a Wow sticker?  Hey, Mike, see you later.  Okay, bye, Spaz.  All right, bye.  My ambassador syndicate.  That's what we're trying to figure out right now, you ass.  Big Cab, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Wow stickers at the Ranch 1 in the Rockaway Mall yesterday.  Okay, there's one. 
[02:42:00]  They were putting them on every tray that got handed out.  Okay, very good.  I must have saw three, four hundred go out.  All right, that's very good.  Okay, thank you.  Take care.  So that one store in Jersey has them.  We have an hour and a half away from you.  Yeah.  All right, that's a good sign.  You know, places an hour and a half from the station have the stickers.  Ranch 1's a block away don't.  Okay, good.  Okay.  Thank you, Big Cab.  See you later.  All right.  Let's see what Tim says.  Tim, what's going on? 
[02:42:30]  What's up, guys?  How are you?  No, listen.  I live in Jersey, but I was working, say, about a half hour ago, I was working in Manhattan,  and I worked for a bakery on 9th Avenue.  I don't know what street it was, but there's a Ranch 1 on 9th Avenue, and they're definitely  giving out wow stickers.  Okay.  Very good.  One more thing.  Feeling better.  Yeah.  Is this thing with Spaz definitely happening on Tuesday?  Yes.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Good, because I go to college in Jersey, and me and my frack brother are going to abuse  the hell out of him.  All right.  This is very good.  Yeah.  On Tuesday, we're going to have a promotion.  We're going to have Spaz in his Boy Scout uniform, and we found out earlier in the show 
[02:43:00]  that he's $47,000 in debt.  Where is that?  He's going to be in front of Brooklyn Diner, right?  In front of the Brooklyn Diner, and for $5, you get to yell and scream and say whatever  you want.  You guys rock, baby.  All right, man.  That's Jen.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  A couple more here.  Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, 42nd and 6th Avenue.  The Ranch 1, they ain't got them, man.  They don't have them there either.  Okay.  No.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  I had a...  Okay.  Dude, your phone was crapping on it.  I didn't mean to hang up on you.  Ole.  Yeah, this is me.  Hey, how are you?  I got...  Ole, great show.  Thank you.  Get rid of Spaz.  My ears are bleeding.  Okay.  But I got the WoW sticker.  I'm down here in 55 Water Street.  All right.  Okay.  And it's around the corner from where I work, Ranch 1.  Okay.  I picked up two stickers.  All right.  Good.  And next thing you know, people were asking me, where'd you get it?  Where'd you get it?  Oh, cool.  Okay.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  We don't want any false advertising.  So what I'm getting at here, Anthony, is that about 50% of the stores have the WoW stickers.  Just from the quick little polling we just did.  Okay.  And there's about six or eight more people on the phone.  One guy checked on Long Island, don't have the stickers.  Pearl Street doesn't have the stickers.  So it's maybe even less than 50%.  Yeah.  My quick polling that we just did.  So you might have to search around to a few Ranch 1 locations. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I think it would be smart if the marketing department at NAW is listening.  It might be a good idea to get them to all the Ranch 1 locations.  Yes.  Or just about all the Ranch 1 locations.  Good idea.  Do it like a blast radius from this building.  The closer to the building, top priority.  One guy just got one in the Westchester Mall.  So that's a good sign.  Ranch 1 there has them.  Long Island.  We did great in Long Island. 
[02:45:00]  Want to thank all our listeners out there.  We should get some WoW stickers out on Long Island.  Yeah.  And I still live out there.  I want to see WoW all over the damn, you know, cars on the LIA and the Northern State and the Southern State and all the fine roads and highways and stuff.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  So obviously we're still working out the bugs, but check around for the WoW stickers at the Ranch 1 locations.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  You can, you know, make it real easy for yourself.  Just send a self-addressed stamp envelope in and we'll send out a WoW sticker.  Okay? 
[02:45:30]  WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York, 10106.  Self-addressed stamp envelope.  Attention WoW.  Somewhere on the envelope.  Okay?  Yeah.  And that address is on the WNEW website and the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, which is foundrymusic.com.  Okay?  Yes.  All right.  Let's get back to Spaz's Week in Review, Anthony.  We don't have to take a break.  We could do a little more.  Yeah.  Let's do a little more. 
[02:46:00]  Sit down, Spazzy.  Spazzy.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's get right back into the tape, Anthony.  I want to thank the people that called in with the Ranch 1 stuff, but you can hang out now. 
[02:46:30]  We understand that there's a slight problem there.  We'll figure it out.  Okay?  All right.  Let's get right back into Spaz's Week in Review, which he taped yesterday.  Here we go.  And speaking of baseball, we reported a few weeks ago that George Steinbrenner is using  cancer to sell tickets and using cancer to exploit his Yankee team so everybody can feel  sorry for him and tune into his games and the Met games.  Rudy Giuliani is now reporting that he has cancer.  He now is reporting that he has cancer in the prostate. 
[02:47:00]  And I know the prostate is in the ass, but I'm not sure what it's used for.  I really don't know.  All right.  The prostate's not in the...  Did that even make the error?  I don't even know, because sometimes they dump out.  No, I think it was a medical...  All right.  Spaz, the prostate is not in the butt.  No.  It's not.  It's not, but I thought that that's like where they, you know...  They can check it in some respects from the butt, because it leans right up against your 
[02:47:30]  colon there, you know, so if the doc has to dig in there and feel around through the  walls of your colon, he can feel if your prostate's swollen or there's anything growing on it or  anything.  But it's not in your butt.  But I thought that when it grows, it starts coming out.  It's just stopping.  Come on.  Come on.  What?  Wait, wait, what?  When the cancer grows, what happens?  I thought that as you go older, you grow older, your prostate grows. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Why did we have to waste valuable radio time with that Ben Stein character?  We could have been doing this for the last two hours.  What led you to believe that?  I thought I saw this in a movie once.  In a movie where something was...  I thought that that was what happened.  Were you watching like the Discovery Channel and then you saw a monkey or something and 
[02:48:30]  thought that was the butt of a human?  That red, red glass with that stuff hanging.  Damn you.  I just thought that because they checked the prostate through the butt, that that's where  it grows out from.  When it gets big.  When it gets swollen, it comes out of the butt.  Uh-huh.  Do you know what the prostate is for?  Um, no.  All right. 
[02:49:00]  What do you think it's for?  I thought it was like, you know, how like the appendix is the second stomach?  I thought it was the second bladder or something.  The appendix is the second stomach?  Yeah, it's the second stomach.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's a smaller version of your stomach where all the excess stuff...  Yeah.  Is it like a mini stomach?  Like...  Mini stomach.  Mini...  Mini...  I'm not that hungry tonight, so I'll just use my mini stomach.  No. 
[02:49:30]  My appendix?  Way back when.  Way back when.  Here we go.  1876, when the Yankees were playing the Milwaukee Brewers.  Okay, way back when.  Way back when, humans, when they graduated from monkeys, they had...  Did they get a diploma when they graduated from monkeys?  From Iona.  From Iona?  You stupid idiot.  Evolutionized.  I just feel good calling you a stupid idiot, all right?  They evolutionized?  What?  They evolutionized from Homo something to Homo sapiens. 
[02:50:00]  Homo erectus.  You wouldn't just want to say they evolved.  Evolved.  They evolutionized, Opie.  No, I think...  I like...  They graduated.  They graduated.  Did they have a graduation speaker for this graduation?  Uh-uh.  No.  No.  No.  They graduated, but they had two stomachs, which over time, one stomach became smaller and  smaller and became your appendix.  Spaz, Patrick Ewing, more evolved than Anthony? 
[02:50:30]  No.  Okay, terrific.  And why would you say that Patrick Ewing is not more evolved than Anthony?  Because he has longer arms that look like dragging the floor.  All right.  Okay, we apologize once again to all our listeners.  See, now that's an example of racism.  I'm not racist.  Yes, you are.  That's not a racist statement.  You're ignorant.  He has long arms.  So? 
[02:51:00]  So, but they're kind of like curved at the palm.  All right, we're going to stop you because you're going to get us all, like, killed or  in a lot of trouble.  I apologize for the last statement.  Matt, what's going on?  Matt, I'm impressed with you.  In fact, you said prostate, not prostate, which is good.  I'll give you credit for that.  Prostrate.  Second of all, all right, as bad as you pay attention, your prostate is at the very top  of your urethra.  It's a hose that comes through the penis.  It's where you urinate out of.  Second of all, you are correct.  As you get older, your prostate does begin to grow. 
[02:51:30]  As well as a young man, it can't be felt upon your digital rectal examination.  You following me?  Ow.  You got it?  Okay.  Second of all, it does secrete some nutrients, which gives sperm motility.  That's what it's used for.  Got it?  Okay.  That's something called BNBA fascia.  It blocks any cancer.  It's not, it's probably what it's used for, but it's a piece of skin that blocks the prostate  from the colon, so it can't spread back into the colon.  Got it?  I think so.  All right. 
[02:52:00]  And, guys, you are a genius because you have everyone fooled.  Nobody can be this stupid.  You are brilliant, and keep it up, and don't ever give in to the fact that you have everyone  suckered.  All right.  Because if you are just dumb, you can't be allowed to live.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You are a genius, and I'm sure people at Iona are just, you know, stinging themselves up  right now.  All right, Matt.  Take care.  Matt the urologist checking in.  He's sending everybody straight.  Phone's a little crappy.  Chris from Brooklyn. 
[02:52:30]  Me being a black man, I love spaz.  Whoa.  He destroys all notions of white supremacy.  That's kind of true.  All right.  Let's get back to spaz as we can review, everyone.  In the prostate.  And I know the prostate is in the ass, but I'm not sure what it's used for.  I really don't know.  I should know, but I don't.  Anyway, he has prostate cancer, and it could, you know, I've heard of weirder things, but  it could be a conspiracy.  I don't know.  It's because he hangs out with Steinbrenner a lot. 
[02:53:00]  He doesn't do lunch with him, so I don't know, because Rudy's under a lot of fire with  his wife thing.  He doesn't even sleep in the same bed as her, so I don't know.  But I heard that the prostate, you get prostate cancer usually from using your ass a lot.  But anyway.  Wait.  I can't laugh anymore.  I want to go home.  Oh, my God.  I just want to go home.  Now, Spaz, you get the cancer from using your ass too much? 
[02:53:30]  I thought that because, you know, things rub up in there against the prostate, they made  you get a little sore.  So, all right, let me follow your logic here.  So, basically, gay guys get this type of cancer more than straight guys.  Is that kind of what you're saying by your butt being used?  I would say so, yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, because of the friction, that's causing the cancer.  So, why wouldn't women get vagina cancer every two seconds? 
[02:54:00]  But wouldn't they also get prostate cancer too?  Oh, okay.  And at this point, why don't you have mouth cancer?  But don't women get prostate cancer.  That's a good joke.  If you could find one woman that has prostate cancer, I will give you the 40%.  $47,000 you need to pay off your debts.  So, they don't have prostates? 
[02:54:30]  Very good, Spaz.  The woman doesn't have a prostate.  So, what takes the place of the prostate in that area?  Why would a woman, the urologist just called and told you exactly what the prostate is used for.  It's to nourish the sperm cells.  Yes.  And to supply a seminal fluid for the spermatozoa to swim in. 
[02:55:00]  So, why would a woman need a gland for that?  But don't women also spew?  They do.  Well, when they orgasm, sure.  There's something that is a discharge of mostly a mucus substance.  That's right.  From the vaginal walls and the cervix.  This is Stan Long Live Spaz's Week in Review.  I make my wife listen to this moron every week, and she stops asking me when we're having kids, Eddie. 
[02:55:30]  You are hysterical.  The woman's prostate.  As much as you would be walking around with eggs.  And why do you think that Rudy's getting it up the poop chute?  Yeah.  This is all alleged.  I hope people understand that.  We don't need to be...  Of Spaz's opinions.  We don't need to be sued because Spaz thinks Rudy's getting it up the poop chute.  Does he have the gay face that you explained a few weeks back?  That he does.  Rudy Giuliani, our own mayor, has the gay face. 
[02:56:00]  Could you remind everyone what the gay face is once again?  The gay face is when you're more square than circle, and your chin is a little bit longer than it should be.  Well, then he's got the total gay face, doesn't he?  Yes, he does.  He's got the big gay forehead.  And because he has the gay face, he's gotten some action in the balloon knot, and that's why he's got this cancer.  Well, think about it.  He doesn't go around with his wife anymore.  So how else is he going to action?  So maybe he's banging another broad. 
[02:56:30]  Well, who would?  Who would bang him?  What girl would bang him?  All right.  Who would bang you?  Let's move on, Anthony, to the next story.  As fast as we can review, we're running out of time.  And people are just coming in and shaking their heads.  Also happening in the local news, the Houdini hooker, she was on LSD at the time that she was arrested.  She was arrested right around the Lincoln Tunnel, and she decided to drive to Secaucus to a hotel, which she put down as her place of residence. 
[02:57:00]  Apparently, now, after a few days after that, she's saying now that she was on LSD, and she tripped out, and she thought she was being arrested by Martians.  So she had to flee as fast as possible.  I don't know why people pick up hookers.  I don't know why police pick up these hookers, because basically, it's just another job out there.  Just because it's not a job regulated by the federal government, then I don't understand. 
[02:57:30]  These are people's pleasures.  Are they going to arrest people who sell cigarettes now or alcohol?  It's just a business to get by.  You only arrest a person if they're abusing something, not if they're just trying to get by and make a living.  There are other things you could do by arresting, like shutting down drug cartels and crap like that.  You don't need to be arresting with small-time people like prostitutes.  Anyway, you arrest her under charge for having LSD, possessing drugs, not for being a prostitute. 
[02:58:00]  That's my stance on that.  That totally went by me.  Oh, my God.  Well, first of all, Spaz is saying leave the hookers alone.  Yes, because it's just another form of business.  It's regulated, but just because it's not regulated by the federal government does not mean that it should be shut down.  You feel it's a victimless crime?  Yes, I do.  Spaz, have you ever been to a hooker?  No, I have not.  Why do you say that with a smile on your face?  Because the thought of it is funny. 
[02:58:30]  Why?  I don't know.  It's just funny.  All right.  Any comments on that one, Ant?  No.  Like I said, it totally went over my head.  We should be taking care of drug cartels instead of arresting hookers.  Drug cartels.  Because the hookers aren't doing any damage to us.  It's just another vice.  It's like people drink, so you've got to arrest people because they drink.  You've got to arrest people because they smoke cigarettes.  It's just another vice.  A guy from Hawthorne wants to know,  is Spaz looking in the mirror when he describes the gay face? 
[02:59:00]  Rich wants to know if Janet Reno has a prostate, too.  She could.  She could, huh?  Yeah.  All right, let's move on, Anthony.  Spaz is a week in review.  Thank you.  Anyway, moving on to the last two stories,  which happened to fall into the entertainment thing.  Darva Conger, the multimillionaire bride,  who I think is getting way too much coverage,  as well as his Mick Rockwell,  whatever the hell his name is, 
[02:59:30]  her now ex,  Darva Conger is now going to spread her legs for Playboy and spare it all and show her whatever to Playboy.  So I know that people are going to be curious to pick up the issue, even me.  I'm going to be curious to pick up the issue.  But no one really cares about Darva Conger.  She's getting way too much publicity over this little thing.  It was a nice little piece of paper.  Remember, the show's over. 
[03:00:00]  Your 15 minutes of fame are up.  But people are going to pick up the picture anyway, the issue anyway.  And then they've got to interview Rockwell to get his thoughts on picking up the issue and everything.  Who the hell cares?  Nobody cares about these people.  These people had their 15 minutes of fame.  Show's over.  They're not going to air it again.  So just do your little Playboy thing.  Let's see your f***s and then just be done with it.  I mean, why does every big issue, every person, when they know their 15 minutes of fame up,  it happens to every personality that they've got to go just spread their legs to get their last-ditch effort. 
[03:00:30]  Well, spread your legs.  People will pick it up to see.  But nobody cares about Rockwell's comments on it.  At least I don't.  Now, the final little blurb, which is going to be very quick.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  So when are you going to be spreading your legs?  15 minutes of fame.  Because your fame is just about up.  And when the 15 minutes of fame is up, it...  What are you going to choose, Playgirl or Blue Boy?  I'm not posing naked for any magazine.  Someone hopes you die of ovarian cancer. 
[03:01:00]  Beth checking in, Opie.  Hilarious.  Beth checking in saying she's having sex in her ears for a month straight.  Hoping she gets ear cancer so she doesn't have to hear any more of spazes we can review.  We learned today that friction causes cancer, everyone.  Yes.  That's why guys get prostate cancer.  Because when they're gay guys, the friction against the prostate that is residing in the butt. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  Kyle, what's going on?  What's up, you guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I know everyone's dogging spaz, but I've got to tell you, I love this part of the show.  Because no matter how bad my life gets, it can always be frigging worse.  Man, this cracks me up, man.  Spaz, I love you, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go to Lisa real fast.  Lisa, what's up?  Hey, everybody.  You guys are great.  I've been listening to you for about a year.  Oh, thank you. 
[03:02:00]  This is probably the worst part of your show.  I know.  I'm stuck in traffic, and I can't concentrate on the road.  He's such a moron.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Sorry, buddy.  He says thank you to that.  All right.  Cool.  Well, thank you, Lisa.  Have a great weekend.  All right.  The final story, Anthony.  Oh, thank God.  Here we go.  Regis Philman.  Regis Philman.  Regis who?  Okay.  What's his name? 
[03:02:30]  Philman.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say a word.  Don't say it.  What's his name?  Regis Philman.  Philman.  How do you spell Philman?  P-H-I-L-B-I-N.  Be silent.  I saw his name written down to be silent, isn't it?  I saw the name. 
[03:03:00]  Even monkeys know how to pronounce his name.  You can't turn around without hearing his name.  Every day, Tony Pig has it wrong when he announces,  And now, Regis Philman and Kathy Lee Gifford.  I thought the B was silent.  Regis Philman.  Oops.  You've never heard it pronounced before anywhere?  I've heard it pronounced, but I thought the B was silent.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  One guy wants to give you $200 toward your $47,000 debt if he can beat you up.  No. 
[03:03:30]  No physical harm.  Spaz, you have aim damage.  The B is silent.  Rain damage.  Wait.  There's another one here that's pretty good.  Okay.  I think Spaz should sell off his organs to pay his debt.  He's wasting perfectly good kidneys and a liver.  The transplant team.  Check it in.  Hello.  This is Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  I love Spaz, brother.  He makes me feel like a genius.  Thank you, brother.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother. 
[03:04:00]  Out.  Regis Philman.  Philman.  Because, Ovi, just like many other names and many words in the English language, the B is silent.  So, the B is silent, but it turns into an M.  Philman, you say.  Philman.  You're not even saying fill-in.  I guess like...  Tell me if the B is silent.  People are throwing things at you now.  Like plum.  Like plum.  The B at the end of plum is silent. 
[03:04:30]  But it sounds like there's an M in there.  Or how about dumb?  Spaz.  The B in dumb is silent.  Say Regis Philbin.  Regis Philbin.  Okay.  There you go.  Okay.  Is that your final answer?  Yes.  I can't believe how stupid he is.  Gelman.  Or Elman.  The G is silent.  All right.  As we play this last story, let's clear the lines and get right into what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:05:00]  We'll do one long break here instead of taking a break, because this is too good.  So, tell them to...  Yeah, even if...  Wait a minute.  Somebody's commenting.  God damn it.  Even if the B was silent in Philbin, where the hell does the M come from?  That's what I was saying.  That's...  He would...  It sounds like there's an M in there.  Look, I got it queued up again.  Listen.  It sounds like Jew.  Listen.  Ready?  Regis Philbin.  Regis Philbin, uh... 
[03:05:30]  There's an M in there.  If it's a B silent, there wouldn't be an M.  That would be Regis Philbin.  That's how I heard it.  So, you thought it was spelled like a thumb.  There was an M and a B there, and you get rid of the B, so you still have to pronounce the M.  Yes.  But you spelt it right when I asked you.  You dumb F.  I can't believe it.  He's an idiot, Gelman.  That's how we sound it.  All right.  Where's Kathy E?  The L silent. 
[03:06:00]  Now, a lot of...  Now, a lot of people, they're playing, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  We're going to go right into the phones in a second here.  Let's not just do all spas, because there was a lot of other great things on the show today.  Oh, absolutely.  A lot of wacky, crazy things.  Absolutely.  Think back to the beginning of the show.  I hope somebody out there picks up on some of the interesting things that were said about Dale Earnhardt.  All right?  All right.  Let me get back to Regis.  Phil, Phil, Phil, Philman.  Wait, I want to give my best to Eric here in Deer Park. 
[03:06:30]  He just learned that his mom has prostate cancer, so I just want to say...  That's very sad.  His mom.  Who gets ovarian cancer?  I just want to know.  Ovarians.  They said, Spaz, I hope you get ovarian cancer.  No, only women can, because ovaries have the eggs.  Ovaries have the eggs.  So they get egg cancer? 
[03:07:00]  No.  Bad eggs?  No, they have...  All right, listen.  Yeah, okay, good.  Let's finish up with Spaz's Week in Review right here.  Regis Philman.  Regis Philman, this is a little short, little blurb,  fretted while searching for his wallet after a premiere of I Dream of Africa the other night.  The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire host finally found it under a seat at the theater.  The wallet was very fat.  So why is he complaining about not getting enough money on a multi-millionaire show?  Huh?  Anyway. 
[03:07:30]  What?  What?  Wait a minute.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold on.  What?  My head is spinning in 12 different directions.  I have no clue what that was about.  He lost his wallet at the premiere of...  I Dream of Africa.  I Dream of Africa.  Yes.  Lost my wallet.  And you have a problem with that?  Yeah, I explained what the problem is.  Okay.  Thank God they returned the wallet.  But it belonged to Regis Philman.  Not me.  I can't believe it.  Here we go. 
[03:08:00]  Hold on to your seats.  Is it a kind of...  I just thought it was kind of interesting that he's in a...  Seeing an African movie or an African play or an African premiere, as they say, and he  loses his wallet.  I just found that kind of interesting.  Oh, my God.  All right.  He's in a room full of...  Hold on.  Now I understand what he's saying, and oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Because the movie title had something to do with Africa in it, you felt that his wallet 
[03:08:30]  disappeared because...  Why?  He was in a room full of Africans.  Oh, my God.  Why would all the Africans go to see this movie?  Did you ever hear a movie called Out of Africa?  No.  This movie's in that same vein.  Do you know who's starring in the movie?  No.  Kim Basinger?  I didn't know that.  Who's she?  A fine black woman?  No, she's white.  Oh, my God.  All right.  This is going to get ugly, and I apologize before I even hit this. 
[03:09:00]  I've never apologized on a radio show before.  Never.  Until we came back to New York.  Sorry.  Here we go.  I just found that kind of interesting because wouldn't he be in a room full of African-Americans?  They'd be trying to recruit for a show because they want more African-Americans on the show.  You know, I just thought it was kind of interesting that a whole lot of African-Americans were in that theater with him  seeing I Dream of Africa, and he lost his wallet, and then mysteriously found it.  I think he should have checked his wallet to see if there's anything missing from it.  Anyway, that's my view on that, and that's just K-Dawg Weekend Review. 
[03:09:30]  See you next week.  I'll see you next week.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, my God.  I'm speechless.  Absolutely speechless.  Someone can put K-Dawg to sleep.  Where's the blue fluid that they pump into the animals after they get hit by the car?  Hook him up to the IV, the blue fluid.  Someone will cuddle his head and watch him pass off into another friggin' plane. 
[03:10:00]  Maybe he'll come back as a more intelligent animal, a gnat.  I'm not racist.  Oh, my God.  It's...  Stupid child is bad and nitwick, and he makes me nauseous.  Whoa!  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles that he causes.  Whoa!  Man's a bum with brain damage and thought processes on board.  Whoa!  Stupid child is bad and nitwick, and he makes me nauseous.  Whoa!  Whoa! 
[03:10:30]  Whoa!  I'm a little idiot, and I'm a little idiot.  Whoa!  Call him Kevin K. don't spaz when he picks up the phone.  Whoa!  Don't expect an answer, cause his brain cells are all blown.  Whoa!  How'd he get his job without one?  Hey, well, I don't know.  Whoa!  Biggest child you ever heard on New York radio.  Hey, stupid child is bad and nitwick, and he makes me nauseous.  Whoa!  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles that he causes.  Whoa!  Man's a bum with brain damage and thought processes on board.  Whoa!  Stupid child is bad and nitwick, and he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little idiot, dumb little guy.  Come on!  Dumb little guy. 
[03:11:00]  Come on!  Dumb little guy.  Come on!  Dumb little idiot, dumb little guy.  Okay, brother.  Wow.  Well, there you have it.  Spaz's Week in Review.  Thank you, Spaz.  Ending it on a real feel-good note.  Thank you, Spaz.  What a mess.  Alan from Hoboken.  We're getting right into what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show before we head  out of here for the weekend.  Yeah.  What I learned today, if Dale Earnhardt lets the passenger play with the stick shift, 
[03:11:30]  they get half the prize.  That's good.  That's very good.  All right.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Bob.  Bob, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned I've been saying my name wrong the whole time.  It's really O.  The B's are silent.  The B's are silent.  It's Bob, but we'll call you O.  Just call me O.  Because everyone knows the B's are silent. 
[03:12:00]  Well, actually, it would be Mom.  Because you've got to replace the B with the M sound.  Yeah.  So your name is Mom.  Yes.  Yeah, you got a point there.  Okay.  Thanks for calling, Mom.  Later.  It's more good if they call you Mom instead of Bob.  What a tool.  Let's go to Louis.  I love it.  Louis, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  It sounds like a human.  It walks and talks like a human.  You know what I learned today? 
[03:12:30]  I'll tell you what I learned today.  That spaz is a dumb astard.  That's number one.  I learned today that if you go to a play about Africa,  hide your freaking wallet,  I also learned today that spaz is also,  Oh, my God.  How could this human be?  Oh, yeah.  I've learned one other thing.  Look how pissed he gets.  I learned that my prostate must be stuck up my ass,  much like spaz's head is stuck up his ass. 
[03:13:00]  All right, Louis.  Thank you.  I've got to give a few more people a chance here.  Dumb jack off.  Jay, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, you want to know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that spaz must have a prostate in his throat  because when he talks, it sounds like he's talking out of his ass.  You're a jerk off, spaz.  You're a jerk off.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Now, this is a great concept.  It's going to happen Tuesday.  Jay, we really do feel bad for spaz.  We found out today that he's $47,000 in debt. 
[03:13:30]  In debt.  He's told me the whole story, and it is pretty sad when you get right down to it.  What, the part that he spent that much money for an Iona diploma?  Or the part that he owes the other $20,000 for?  Yeah, he's in a rough situation.  Yeah.  But besides that, what we want to do for spaz, this coming Tuesday, you've got to make plans.  I'm serious.  We're going to get spaz in his Boy Scout uniform because we found out he was a troop leader, Anthony. 
[03:14:00]  I was in the Boy Scouts, and that's why I don't care if there's a gay Scoutmaster.  Right.  So I'm going to get my little Bushcatcher uniform.  Right.  And we're going to make him hold a sign that says, you could abuse me for $5.  Say whatever you want for $5.  I am ripping this idea off from this homeless guy in Times Square that makes me laugh.  He has a huge app for a lot of you.  And what does the sign say on the guy in Times Square?  Insult me for a dollar or something like that?  Tell me off for a dollar. 
[03:14:30]  Tell me off for a dollar.  So we're going to do tell me off for $5, and we're going to have people line up.  I'm not kidding.  And you get about a minute's a long time.  In 30 seconds.  If you can't say it in 30 seconds, man, 30 seconds, $5, you get to say whatever the hell you want to spaz.  We want all races to show up.  We just don't want any physical abuse.  No, you can't touch him at all.  No, don't touch him, but you can say whatever the hell you want to his face for $5.  It'll be the best $5 you ever spend in your life.  Okay? 
[03:15:00]  Cool.  And what we'll do is I think we should definitely get some type of charity.  Give half to spaz, which is a charity in itself, and half to a real charity.  How about the Cuban Black Yankee fans of America?  The Cuban Black Yankee fans of America?  That would be a good place to start, yes.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that I better not do my wife in the balloon nut or she may get prostate cancer.  Yes.  Very good.  At least we learned something. 
[03:15:30]  Maybe we're saving millions of lives on this program.  All right.  Syndication now.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to TJ real fast.  TJ, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Hey, we learned that the word chew can sure spark some heavy conversation.  Oh, chew?  Chew, yes.  Yes, chewing.  Chew.  Chew.  Right.  Yep.  Syndication, they can't stop it.  All right.  Yes.  Syndication on the ground.  I like it.  Anyway, you can get the word out there for us.  You guys rock.  Whatever it takes.  Internet.  Internet.  You guys rock.  Thank you, TJ.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:16:00]  Bye.  Let's go to Keith.  Keith, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just found out.  I got back from the Mayo Clinic.  I just learned my wife has full-blown testicular cancer.  We're in the same boat, you know?  Baz, you idiot.  I've been wanting to just, oh, I can't stand you.  You suck.  Just get five bucks.  And if you guys think five bucks is a little steep, then get a representative from your office.  You collect a dollar from each, and then you go down there with the five bucks, and you tell Spaz off of your office. 
[03:16:30]  You know what really cracks me up is when Spaz was giving his commentary for his newscast, you know, he felt real strong when he was talking about the hooker thing.  You notice that?  Yeah, I know.  He felt real confident and strong.  He's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's like, what the hell?  He didn't stumble, but, you know.  He was strong about two issues today, hookers and gays.  And gays in the Boy Scouts.  I think he was probably waiting for you guys to say, okay, this is where he thinks he was doing really well, you know, or the rest I can work on, you know?  Keith, half the time, and I just don't even have the energy to, like, go further with some of these stories. 
[03:17:00]  We just let it play out there.  I ran out of energy today.  Yeah.  Thank you, Keith.  I learned that Milwaukee had a baseball team before the city even existed.  Yes.  There you go.  I'm trying to think of something I learned today.  I don't think I learned anything today.  People are writing stuff down.  Spaz.  Yeah, Spaz has been scratching his head too hard because I think it gave him brain cancer. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, we learned friction causes cancer.  Very important, people.  Thank you for that, Steve.  I did take your line.  You're on the screen.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  If you're thinking about becoming a NASCAR driver, don't pick up hitchhikers.  That's pretty good.  Mark, what's going on?  I learned that I'll never, ever tell anybody I graduated from Iona College.  Yeah.  I think you can at least get a $27,000 back if they really haven't held to their mission statement. 
[03:18:00]  I think the line of the day was someone that sent it in about an hour and a half ago.  They said the value of the Iona diploma is plummeting worse than Microsoft.  Really, really fast.  Yeah.  Are you guys wrong?  Thank you, Mark.  Charles Darwin checking in from London, Opie.  Spaz just blew away all my theories on evolution.  All right.  And let's end with Kevin, I believe.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  Hey.  Yo, I found out that okay brother Jimmy Superfly Snook is not the only stupidest person on the face of the planet. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, he's in good company.  Ouch.  You guys wrong.  Thank you, Kevin.  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right.  I guess we got to leave Anthony.  Yeah.  Another week in the can, as they call it.  Oh, but not too much in the can.  Oh, you'll get pressed there, can't you?  All joking aside, I want to thank our listeners for making us number one in New York.  Yeah, you guys roll, man.  It is the People's Radio Show.  You guys should take a lot of credit for that.  Thank you.  Hey, you got to get a lot of credit there, Robert. 
[03:19:00]  They come up, you guys come up with some great stuff for us, and we know that.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  All right.  Hopefully we could, well, keep the same level of quality that's brought us to the point where we're at.  I know.  It amazes me.  That's for sure.  Quality.  We'll probably see you down at the Otto and George Show, Rascals Sunday.  If not, if you're staying home, definitely check out Backlash, WWF's pay-per-view.  Backlash.  Sounds like it's going to be a really good one with Stone Cold Steve Austin.  See, me. 
[03:19:30]  Returning and all that fun stuff.  Vince McMahon, my son Shane, and my hose-bagged daughter Stephanie.  That's right.  I want to thank Spaz for his week in review.  Bravo, Spaz.  Another fine one.  I want to thank the rest of the crew for working hard this week.  I want to thank Shane McMahon for calling in today.  And we also, believe it or not, want to thank Ben Stein.  He gave us an hour of great radio.  Thank you.  You stupid tool.  Yes, Ben.  Great job on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You came off real well. 
[03:20:00]  Not like a cheap Jew.  It was much better than doing an actual interview.  It actually got people talking.  Yeah.  So, thank you to Ben Stein, you tool.  That'd be really cool.  Next time I see him, I'm going to shove those sneakers up his butt.  That's how I feel.  Hi, look.  I wear sneakers.  Not because I'm cool.  It's because I'm a Jew and I'm cheap.  Oh, my God.  I got these from Ziggy, the homeless guy. 
[03:20:30]  When he was my speech writer, he wore sandals.  Cheap Jew sandals.  Like Henry Kissinger.  I've been wearing the same sneakers since 72.  How come when someone accuses us of something?  I almost got an impression down from you.  Wow, people have to drink pretty heavy in the drinking game rules.  How come when someone accuses us of something on this show, we end up, yeah, we do it.  Like, if you accuse us of something that we never did, we'll hit it hard and heavy.

[03:21:30]  Yes, babbling like an idiot.  I see you, Rick.  I was going somewhere else.  We're going to turn off the mics before we get ourselves in trouble.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday, okay?  Later.  Peace. </pre>
