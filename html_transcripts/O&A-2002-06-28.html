<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about masturbation, ignited by a caller mentioning anti-masturbation devices.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, and numerous callers shared graphic and humorous anecdotes about their masturbatory experiences, detailing the objects and locations used. This included a wide range of items, from Nerf footballs and banana peels to computer mice, and locations ranging from tree forts and bathrooms to other people's houses.  The conversation also touched on the difficulties of maintaining discretion, instances of being caught, and the physical sensations involved.  The discussion meandered into unrelated topics such as shock devices for bed-wetting, interracial relationships, and the merits of morning versus nighttime sex.

The show continued with a focus on listeners' unusual sexual experiences and exploits. Opie recounted personal anecdotes, including being aroused by his cousin's discarded clothing and masturbating while watching WWF pay-per-view.  A caller, Mike, described his wife's angry reaction to him masturbating at home.  This transitioned into the "WOW Contest," featuring women submitting photos of themselves.  Lisa, a former *Sopranos* extra, appeared in-studio, along with model Wendy June for a photoshoot.  Multiple female callers shared their own explicit experiences with masturbation, detailing childhood experimentation, the use of household items, and specific locations during sex.  One caller described masturbating in her date's bathroom before intercourse, while another recounted work-related dizziness and nausea from masturbating at work.  A previously aired call of a woman masturbating while describing a pornographic film was also mentioned. Station employee Bruce Mittman provided comedic commentary on the explicit content.  The segment concluded with "F.U." messages from listeners.

The next portion involved Opie recounting a negative experience with his girlfriend's overprotective father, using highly offensive language.  Several callers then shared embarrassing sexual experiences. One female caller described masturbating with a hairbrush when her roommate walked in, and another, "Katie," had a similar experience. A male caller, Larry, recounted having sex with his friend's mother. Wendy June called in to promote a bikini car wash and her photos on the Opie and Anthony website.  The hosts and callers spent considerable time discussing the contestants' photos using crude and offensive language.  More "F.U." calls followed, along with a lengthy, offensive discussion about the death of John Entwistle. A heated and offensive phone call with an angry female listener, Eileen, concluded this segment.


The broadcast then shifted to a brief, nonsensical segment involving a "rolling bubble" and a dice game, followed by a discussion about the show's format changes, specifically the shortening of recurring segments.  A listener, Henry, called in with a childhood story about creating a sex toy from a teddy bear and grape jelly.  Pharrell Williams called in, detailing a stressful ordeal involving a car he lent to a friend who then sold it, resulting in threats and federal agent involvement. The "What Did We Learn?" segment followed, featuring listener-submitted phrases reflecting the day's conversations, often sexually suggestive and crude (references to a "tickle," a cousin, "moose noses," bananas, Nerf footballs, and potato salad). The segment also mentioned the "WOW Contest" with its $5,000 prize. The show concluded with a humorous skit about a restaurant order, incorporating the "Greco-Roman size" phrase.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, welcome to Opie and Anthony Burger. Can I interest you on our number 4 special tonight?  Great, I need number 4, please supersize, the Greco-Roman size.  Number 4, Greco-Roman size.  Anything to drink with that, sir?  I need a big Coke.  Give me one big Coke.  Okay, sir, anything else?  Give me the curly shoes to go with my curly flies.  Okay, that's number 4, supersize, the Greco-Roman size, a big Coke, and some curly shoes to go with your curly fries. 
[00:00:30]  Sir, if this is correct, please spit into the microphone.  Ah, poof.  Thank you, please drive up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  More weed every day.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  I'm not gay!  I'm desperate! 
[00:01:00]  I got sort of a kind of appointment.  Cancel your appointment!  Marijuana is the bomb.  Too sexy.  Come on.  Yeah, but you got the eyes.  Like yesterday, I was having breakfast over there, like, and today, I'm having the same kind of breakfast, almost like, like that breakfast happened at that moment. 
[00:01:30]  The way you would have things done back then.  How about a biscuit?  Oh, huh?  You're a filthy slob.  Mule.  You got me mad last week.  He stinks, and I don't like it. 
[00:02:00]  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  I didn't do enough for you.  What are you people?  On soul?  This place blows.  On soul?  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like, almost like it was the same day. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, what he said.  Go right to your neck like an animal.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Shoe.  The Friday version.  Yes, Anthony.  I see the potential for some nice phone calls with those clips, man.  We're working on them, Popeye.  God damn, that's great.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-2774.  Wow.  866-2774.  Wow. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, hey, hey, mate.  I say 4th of July weekend starts today.  It does.  It really starts today.  Because today is 4th of July weekend, if next week was the same weekend like I feel today.  We're working a little bit next week.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A lot of people take their vacation next week.  Are you kidding me?  They're already getting out of New York City.  That's what it is, man.  A Friday, before you take your vacation, that's not a work day.  That's play day.  You know, when 4th of July falls on a... 
[00:03:30]  Oh, Thursday.  Okay, midweek.  Thursday feels like a Saturday.  Yeah.  Midweek, it screws up everything.  It really does.  You know?  Just got to take the other days off.  And if you're a boss, you're going to be a prick and make your people work Friday?  Work that Friday.  The day after July 4th?  Sometimes it works out for the best, though, because a lot of bosses do say, all right,  just take that whole four-day weekend thing, which is nice.  But then the scumbag bosses, you have to party on a Thursday, 4th of July, and then show up 
[00:04:00]  on Friday.  Zero works getting done, bosses.  We could go with this a little bit today.  Let's talk to the people that have to work the day after the 4th of July.  Ugh.  Bastard bosses.  And you know what it is?  No one does anything on that day.  No one does anything.  Remember in school, the end of the year, those few days where you're supposed to take tests,  but they said, now you're supposed to attend all of your classes. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  When's that test?  Noon?  And if you did, you're just staring out the window.  Right.  You don't do anything.  It's the same thing with work.  You just, you have to come in on a Friday after a holiday, you're not going to work.  And it's the same when you do a radio show.  Right.  This is like the end of the season, so we're half here today.  We're not working.  No.  Ben actually said he'd join me in a cocktail at about 4.  That's not a bad idea.  How about we start at 3.30?  3.30?  Because that way, Ben, by 5.30, he'll just be belligerent and tolerable. 
[00:05:00]  We'll give one good break today, and then we'll start drinking.  That's it.  Know what we should have done?  We should have done the show outside today.  Beautiful day.  Because, you know, these nice days, everyone remembers back to school where you had the cool teacher that would do class outside, at least.  The cool, groovy teacher that would take you outside by the tree.  But there was something about that.  You're still doing the same crap, but you're outside on the lawn.  I never were.  You didn't mind it as much.  See, and some of us went to class.  I still didn't do the work.  Outside, all I would do is then I'd see my class outside as I was smoking my pot by the gymnasium. 
[00:05:30]  It wasn't like I was going anyway.  I don't care.  They could have the class on the moon.  I'm not going.  And it did you well?  Not going to class?  See, kids?  So you don't have to, like, go all the way to 12th grade?  That's ridiculous.  You can be a successful radio personality, even without all that pesky school.  All you need to do is learn how to count to 100, know the alphabet, and know how to speak a little bit.  Did you just say alphabet?  Alphabet.  The alphabets.  Yeah, see, it went with the bit a little bit. 
[00:06:00]  See, kids are just...  I'm not educated, so alphabet.  Alphabet.  Whatever.  Just tell your parents, hey, Anthony didn't finish high school.  There you go.  That's your excuse.  And we begin.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, I was looking at this webpage today on the computer.  It's a Catholic church webpage or whatnot, and they sell merchandise. 
[00:06:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Sorry.  Hold on.  It's a website that sells anti-pleasuring-yourself equipment.  Anti-pleasuring-yourself equipment.  What's the website?  It's free.freespeech.org.  What?  Free.freespeech.org.  Slash shocking truth.  And what kind of stuff do they sell? 
[00:07:00]  They have detection cream for the parents.  They can rub it on for the girl.  For the, I don't know, the liquid that would come out from down there.  They have to rub it on there, and they would find out what it's on.  It says something about rubbing it on a cucumber to see if it's on there.  They have the Pure Thought Helmet.  And are you on the website?  I can't get to it.  He gave me the wrong thing.  Oh.  Where did it go?  www.dot-what? 
[00:07:30]  It says free.freespeech.  Free.freespeech.org.  Dot-org.  Slash shocking truth.  Slash or dash?  The horizontal.  Or vertical.  I'm sorry.  Vertical.  Vertical is up and down.  Yeah, there you go.  The backslash.  It's a backslash.  Okay.  I'm not getting it.  Shocking truth dot. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, my God.  No, it's not shocking truth dot.  It's just shocking truth.  Slash.  I'm not getting it.  Oh, my God.  Free.freespeech.org.  Dot-org.  Slash shocking truth.  Nope.  Ain't coming up.  You're wrong.  Oh, my God.  You're wrong.  Can I tell you about some of the things that were on this?  And I can clarify this later.  I don't know.  I'm back in the show.  Oh, my God.  Do we have to depend on you? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, I swear to God.  I'll keep it on.  You were the first guy we went to.  You're the go-to guy to kick off this Friday show.  Let me help you out.  Let me explain some of this, and I will get back to you.  Do you realize how important the first caller of a radio show is?  It's very important.  But trust me, I won't disappoint.  Tons of laughter involved.  How is there a free dot free speech?  This is the website that I wrote down earlier.  I was on.  You screwed it up.  You wrote it down. 
[00:09:00]  You suck.  We want to play along.  Our listeners want to play along.  You ruined it.  Now we have to take your word for it.  How about this?  Well, let me explain one thing on there that's hilarious.  Hey, ass.  It's just freespeech.org.  Did you guys get it?  You got it, Ant?  Yeah, because there's no...  He's such an idiot.  All right, Tom, we don't need you anymore.  I got it.  We got the website.  Thank you.  What an idiot.  Silly goose.  So is it an anti-self-pleasuring website? 
[00:09:30]  Anti-self-pleasuring equipment.  I'm going to it now.  Anti-self-pleasuring pants made from toughened plastic available in four sizes.  Locks prevent pants from being removed.  This is like real stuff.  Anti-stiffy ring delivers short, violent shock when your junk becomes excited.  Anti-handling device prevents ring from being removed.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:10:00]  This has to be a gag, right?  It has to be a gag.  It has to be one of those goof websites, no?  It has to be.  A female chastity belt.  How does that work?  Anti-nocturnal emission blanket delivers electric shock when fibers and blanket become  lead.  This cannot be real.  This is a goof.  Come on.  Well, I clicked on that shock thing that goes over your mule.  Yeah.  So I'm waiting for that to come up. 
[00:10:30]  But, uh...  And how does it shock you when you're, uh...  I guess if it detects that you're becoming aroused.  Yeah, but every guy gets...  Well, that'll train you not to.  No, every guy goes through that while you're sleeping.  You know why you're sleeping and it just goes wrink, wrink, wrink, wrink, wrink all night  long?  You kind of wake up and you got to push on it a little.  You ever wake up and you just got to go...  You got to go like...  And push on it?  You ever get one when you're getting a piggyback ride from your grandmother? 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  You know what this thing is?  All right.  All right.  See, they picked the wrong guy.  You know what, Anthony?  They didn't even look at you.  I didn't even acknowledge him.  I'll take my bombing like a man.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I clicked on this, um, this, uh, device that's supposed to shock your junk when you put it  on.  And, uh, see, you picked the wrong guy.  It was in plumbing and heating and air conditioning.  This is, uh, uh, tubing fitting.  This is a fitting that... 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  The plastic...  Yeah.  ...vinyl piping goes on this side.  I'm with you.  And then you can lock the latch.  I'm with you.  I know.  I know that piece, too.  Of course.  You're not doing anything with that.  At least use fittings that you're not going to recognize.  You idiot.  The helmet of pure thought.  Vanish lustful thoughts with this deluxe item.  Click on thumbnail image to read more about this item.  Uh, uh, mule juice detection cream. 
[00:12:00]  Apply to hands, underwear, or bed sheets to detect traces of mule juice.  Cream will turn purple if it comes in contact with the mule juice.  And, uh, vag detection cream.  Same stuff for, um, the women.  Oh, click here to purchase.  Let's see what happens if I want to buy something.  Due to a number of problems we are having setting up online purchasing facilities.  Yeah, this is such a goof website.  Stop.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  He thought it was real. 
[00:12:30]  Chastity belts.  Those are real.  Who, no one has worn a chastity belt in, since the 1800s.  Since the dark ages.  Since maybe the turn of the century.  Well, the old warriors used to put it on their bitches before they went off to war,  so the guys wouldn't be banging them while they were off killing people.  So that was like, but that's ancient history.  What a tool that guy was.  He was our go-to guy.  We could start the show, uh, over.  You want to do that?  I'm going to go with another one here. 
[00:13:00]  Uh-oh.  I'm going to go, I'm going to throw along and see what happens.  Maybe we can get a touchdown here.  All right.  Grayson, what's going on?  Hey, hold on.  Uh-oh.  Bye-bye.  Grayson.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  What's the deal?  I'm about to venture into my first, uh, black relationship, if you will.  Oh, yeah?  Give me some advice.  What kind of music should I play when I'm about to get it on?  Theme from Cops.  Nah, are you serious? 
[00:13:30]  I'm dead serious.  You're not serious, Grayson.  Well, here's the thing.  No, here's the thing.  Is she black if she has a British accent?  That's a big question.  Yes.  Really?  How old are you?  31.  How old is this, uh, girl?  Uh, about 28.  And, uh, have you been dating already?  No, we've, well, we've gone out a couple times, you know, hit the clubs.  But now you're thinking you're going to get serious with her?  No, in fact, serious.  I mean, serious isn't a bad.  Oh.  Eh, that ain't nothing.  Nah, you're, you're just trying to get on the radio. 
[00:14:00]  Well, no, I'm not.  I don't, you guys, I haven't experienced the black love.  I'm afraid, uh, I won't, uh, be able to match up.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Grayson.  You can tell he's, uh, hanging with his buds.  Look, this will get us on the radio today.  Oh, if you're selling to me another side, Americans for Purity, winning the war on self-pleasuring.  And, uh, this is real, though.  Uh, the myths and realities.  Myth, uh, self-pleasuring is harmless. 
[00:14:30]  Reality medical science proves that chronic self-pleasuring causes weakness, depression, forgetfulness, and nearsightedness.  Stop.  Myth.  How many times a day do you have to do that to get into that state?  To where you're nearsighted?  Yes.  I've been cross-eyed a few times from it.  So have I.  The real good ones?  There's such a level.  I don't know if chicks feel the same thing with, uh, that self, uh, self-pleasuring. 
[00:15:00]  Self-abuse, as they call it.  Wait, you said that you don't do that.  Huh?  Oh, I've done plenty in my day, believe me.  But you don't anymore?  I've done plenty.  Uh, no.  No, I'll be.  I've given it up for Lent.  I gave it up for Lent.  Thank God I'm in a position.  But wait.  Where I F whenever I want.  Before work, after work, during work, if need be.  But I think every guy still does it, no matter what they're getting at home. 
[00:15:30]  Nick, you know something?  Normally you're right, and, uh, that's the way it's been many, many times.  But I swear to God, if I'm feeling a little randy at any given moment, it's just like, you  know, throw down on the bed.  You have some action.  I don't know.  When was the last time?  This morning.  No, when was the last time that...  Early time.  No, I don't need that detail.  When was the last time that you did it to yourself?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Years? 
[00:16:00]  It could be.  Could be.  Probably three.  When did I leave my house?  I think I jacked it that day.  Dude, how do you do it in the morning?  I can't, I can't...  Morning sex?  Ever.  I hate it.  What are you, insane?  Dude, I never...  Morning sex is the best.  I'm talking like four in the morning.  Oh, before bed.  You know.  Before bed.  Well, yeah.  And also in the morning, during the morning.  Just waking up and having someone is the best.  Feel a hand over there.  Hello.  I can't do it. 
[00:16:30]  What?  Hey, you're breathing in each other's faces.  I just never liked it.  I swear.  With morning breath.  Depends how you do it.  Breathing in the face depends on where your face is.  That's right.  Sometimes I'm breathing into the back of a neck.  It takes away the healer instinct.  Oh, God, we're going to breathe into the back of your face.  Thank God I said that right.  No, I'm saying, how do you motivate yourself to come to work after that?  After you finish?  Oh, I...  That's what I mean.  No, I agree with you with that. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, it kills everything.  It saps the energy, right?  There are the long-term ones and there are the quickies.  No, if he's at four in the morning, you can still recoup.  Before bed, yes.  But, yeah.  No, there are the ones before work.  A couple hours before showtime.  Yeah.  And you still have your energy?  Like, right before you hop in the shower and...  I'm so with him.  It saps all my energy.  No.  I have no desire to be funny after I do that.  That's the only reason I'm funny.  Well, you've written off having sex before your shows.  Ever.  You told me this.  Ever.  You told me this when I offered.  Yeah.  And you said, no, not before a gig. 
[00:17:30]  Jim's like a prize fighter.  Yeah.  The prize fighters wouldn't have sex.  It takes away your legs.  You can.  It'll take away your legs.  Yeah.  Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom and dump ice water in.  Oh.  Now, anytime, anywhere.  That's the motto.  That's the cumia motto.  It's just...  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, but everyone...  Morning, night, anytime, anywhere.  I understand, but...  I don't know.  I don't think I'm in the minority when I say that.  Sometimes I just like to, you know...  No, I used to crank it all the time, dude. 
[00:18:00]  But that doesn't mean I'm not getting enough.  I'm getting plenty, but sometimes I like to...  No, because you start thinking about the jack, and then it's like, why?  I could, like, you know, I could be plowing.  Feels better.  Feels better than a hand, right?  That's how you do it.  What are you using?  The warmed liver in the microwave?  I'm an expert.  Did I ever tell you that I hollowed out a banana peel?  Oh, brother.  Huh?  When I was a kid, this is true, I hollowed out a banana peel, and I silver duct taped the 
[00:18:30]  outside, and I filled it with warm water.  How was it?  It was awful.  It was like...  Was it?  The water came out, and I was packing too.  Oh.  I was like 14.  I had read about it.  I'm like, oh, I'll try this.  You get so innovative as a kid to try to make it feel like the real deal, right?  You do.  And then you realize, I should have just cranked it.  You know, if things go horribly wrong.  I don't even know if I was cranking it.  Or maybe 13.  I might have been younger.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  People have used cantaloupes and said that's pretty good.  If you drill out a cantaloupe and then put it in the microwave for just like, you know, 
[00:19:00]  three seconds.  One of the dudes from Limp Bizkit admitted that time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Using the cantaloupe.  Because that would be pretty good, right?  Nah.  It comes apart.  You're talking a cantaloupe.  Have you ever used anything?  No.  Not that I remember, really.  I don't.  I never really.  I think once a foam rubber football.  You know those little Nerf footballs that drill a hole? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Like I had a knife and I think I slid it.  Oh, my God.  And figured, let me just bang this.  I was a kid.  You must have got a bad rash.  Dude, I was a kid.  No, it was like very soft foam rubber.  You're a bad dude, man.  Dude, I'm not a hollering out banana peels.  I'm respecting that.  If you can bang a football, you're a man.  It wasn't a football.  It was one of the Nerf.  I'm explaining this.  It was a Nerf football.  They're soft Nerf footballs.  The foam rubber ones. 
[00:20:00]  And I took a knife and just slid it and then loaded it up with, I guess, Vaseline or something.  Did you give it a good angle at least?  And just use that.  Yeah.  You know, I had to rework it.  You know, you try it and go, all right.  It's got to, thank God, it's got to be a little deeper.  You know?  You cut in a little more.  There's Anthony.  This should hit the G-spot.  When you are a kid, you will do anything.  I've heard of the warmed up liver or, you know, mom's fur coat or something, you know? 
[00:20:30]  The best I did was like the pillow.  The pillow?  I think most guys did the pillow growing up.  That's just a dry thing.  No.  No, that's not like you're putting it anywhere.  You're rubbing.  Right, right, right.  Nerf ball trumps all.  The Nerf football?  Yeah, that's awful.  You're going to throw it at one cut of your hand?  Go long.  Hey, who put the stick-em on the ball?  His ball was drooling.  Perfect spiral looks like a pinwheel flying through the sky. 
[00:21:00]  Shooting off.  No, it was just something that was in the room.  It was accommodating.  That's sharing a little too much.  When you are a kid, no it is not, because I guarantee you there are people that just abuse things.  When you are a kid and you're horned up, you kind of got to get creative.  You get, first of all, I was cranking it five times a day.  If I had a sick day, I swear to God, I could have 104 fever when my mother's like, all right, stay home from school and she's got to go out and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  And I'm home alone.  I'd have a fever jerk.  That's right.  Where you're just like, delirious, you're hallucinating, but somehow my hand got down there.  Oh, waka, waka, waka.  You know how crazy guys are in that state growing up?  If you had poison ivy on your hands.  Wouldn't matter.  Right.  It would not matter.  I swear.  If I got five minutes alone at any given moment when I was growing up, I was cranking.  I was cranking.  I swear to God, I was dehydrated from cranking. 
[00:22:00]  To the point where, you know, it would hurt, but you'd still go.  I got one more in me.  I got one more in me.  I didn't care.  I'd go to a tree fort and have the nature jerk.  You always start off strong, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  And by the tenth one of the day, you're like, oh, God, I'm exhausted.  I think all the iron is out of my body.  I need vitamin supplements to regain what I've lost through this.  And at that point, I'll give you a visual. 
[00:22:30]  You're kind of just holding it up.  Pull it so it's thin as a pencil.  Just work it.  You're just aching all over.  You've got a lower backache.  It is, but you know something?  That was all part of growing up as a guy, you know?  And I don't see me as being any different than any other guy.  Sure, with me, it might have been a Nerf football.  But I'm sure there are other things that people use. 
[00:23:00]  You get creative because, like I said, you're doing it so much that you kind of would just get bored.  It wouldn't stop you from doing it, but it kind of got a little monotonous.  You'd look for something else.  That's why when you got your hands on some Vaseline or something like that, oh, my God, field day.  I was finishing once on my third time.  I'll never forget this.  Sometimes you're just doing it because you're bored and you really want to do something.  Like a monkey in a cage.  Yeah.  I'm bored.  I don't even think I had a full run.  And I'm finishing.  I look at the TV.  I had a black and white TV and Happy Days was on. 
[00:23:30]  And I'm finishing and Tom Bosley is on television.  Oh, God.  That classic.  Couldn't at least get a Joanie shot.  If I wasn't watching the TV.  That was on there.  Yeah.  I better forget that awful.  I'm like, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, Fonzie.  Jean, what's going on?  Hi.  Jean's a nurse.  We're backing up a little bit.  The junk shocking thing, you guys use that on kids that wet the bed?  Yeah, they do.  Stop. 
[00:24:00]  I swear.  I swear.  They use that for kids to try to train them not to wet the bed at night.  That's good.  How does it work?  They put, it's a lip device.  It's like a beeper.  And they put it in their underwear in the part where, you know.  Hold on.  Right.  Yeah, just be very careful.  In the front.  In the front, right?  You don't have.  And if they wet the bed at night, it shocks it.  It like vibrates with a shock.  Get out.  Is it an actual shock or just a really firm vibe?  It's a very strong shock.  Not a shock. 
[00:24:30]  A vibration.  Vibration.  It feels like a shock.  So basically.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the kid will wake up and he'll stop immediately.  Yeah.  You'll stop doing that.  But if something's vibrating there, if I was a kid, I'd figure out a way to do it.  What type of sexual dysfunction does that bring on somebody later in life?  Yeah.  Stupid barbaric parents.  Bedwetting.  Hey, play for a game of football?  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  If a kid, if a grown child is wetting the bed, it's a bigger problem than just shoving  something there that's going to vibrate and shock them. 
[00:25:00]  You've got to look a little deeper into what's going on in that kid's life, because that  just isn't normal.  You just don't do that.  That's antisocial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless there's a physical problem that they could narrow down.  Maybe he's got some muscular problem where he can't hold it.  But if you're just letting go like that with no physical problem, there's something going  on.  Now, you ever get caught?  Get caught, Jack?  Let me tell you something.  I did it, I probably have done it in the hundreds of thousands of times, and never once was  I caught.  I was very, very discreet, very paranoid of being caught, too. 
[00:25:30]  And I would do it, like I said, if I had five spare minutes, I'd go into the, even sometimes,  I'd go into the bathroom, like I was going to the bathroom.  Done out.  Get that red flush look off of my face.  A little cold water.  And back out in the public.  Look, everyone knows I've been caught by my chick.  Recently, which is sick.  Three times.  It's up to three times.  Three times she caught you.  Three times.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  One time because the whole couch was shaking when she was asleep next to me.  No, you can't use the arm in the private, when there's other people, you can't use the  arms.  It's amazing how much stuff you get shaking.  And you're trying to be quiet.  The dresser's moving.  And the door's swinging.  I'll give you another visual.  And then you're like, you have your arm like, and then things are still shaking.  No, you've got to just, there's one way where it's just make the okay sign with your  hand.  Here's the quiet.  There are other people that might hear a thing. 
[00:26:30]  You can make the okay with your fingers.  You're just using that.  Thumb and finger.  And all that's moving is like your wrist.  Oh, that doesn't work.  All that's moving is your wrist.  No way.  Because then you get into it and then your whole body has to get into it.  That's what I mean.  You can't move anything more than your wrist very slowly.  Yes, no.  That's impossible.  Learn from the master.  No, that's a logic.  You have great self-control, my friend.  And a great imagination.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to have something bright in your head. 
[00:27:00]  It's starting to get good.  That little movement is not going to.  But the second the bedside's going.  You're like, all right.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Now I've got to move around like I was just moving.  You're describing my life.  Well, you've got to move around like, oh, oh, I was just moving.  You're describing my life.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  You're so describing what I do.  And then back to it.  But it's a very slow hand.  I can't believe I'm rolling around in my sleep.  Wrist move. 
[00:27:30]  Sometimes you've just got to belt it.  When you wake up, you're like, oh, it's just, oh, punch it.  Dude, my mother walked in on me once.  The only time I ever got caught with my mother.  Oh, God.  And were you just laid out?  I had a Velvet Touch magazine in one hand.  And I was really, really doing a good job.  Were you covered in anything?  Nothing.  Oh, God, no.  My tough skins pulled down on my dumb ankles.  It was the most.  No way I could. 
[00:28:00]  What happened?  How awkward.  Awful.  She walked in.  And she never did.  But I think she's kind of like one of those knock walks.  Oh, stupid parents.  Don't do the knock walk.  And as she walked in, it was like, it was a perfect view.  And I'm like, oh, I'm getting dressed.  Yeah.  Aw, you didn't.  Yeah, what can I do?  What are you getting dressed?  Knock anymore?  Getting dressed in your own seed?  That's all you're getting dressed in.  It was never mentioned.  She never mentioned it.  I never mentioned it.  Doing calculus.  Why did I say that? 
[00:28:30]  Getting dressed.  I don't know what to say.  Hi, my.  You want to give me a hand?  How awkward was it after the fact?  You know what?  Aw, what did you do now?  You've got to see her.  I absolutely closed the door.  I finished.  And I went out a little while later.  You finished?  Yeah.  I don't think it was that awkward.  Hi, Jimmy.  I'll be going to the store for a few minutes.  You'll be alone.  Yeah.  Hi, Jimmy.  I always thought you were cute. 
[00:29:00]  Slow motion scene of mom opening the door.  Life is moving.  There's Jimmy's mom coming out of the pool with that lovely red one piece.  He's got his Captain Hook uniform pulled around his ankles with his hat still on.  Have some pride.  The Captain Hook uniform is part of the job. 
[00:29:30]  Those boys down at IBM expect it.  Have some pride.  He's heaving it out the window.  Oh, the knock walk.  Doesn't anyone effing knock anymore?  The knock walk is useless.  It's a pseudo-courtesy.  If you think your kid might be in there booting up heroin and doing nothing else, perhaps the knock walk is pretty good.  But the fact of the matter is, if the door's closed, yeah, there's probably some jacking going on and you shouldn't just walk in. 
[00:30:00]  Knock walk never makes sense.  No.  Just walk in then.  Even with the example you just gave.  It doesn't give enough time for them to do anything.  No covering up.  Brother Joe.  Joey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know what, Ant?  I think we are pretty twisted.  I mean, just over-sexed, I would have to say, because when you were a kid, like when the testosterone was really pumping, like we're both getting a little bit older now.  When you were a kid, did you ever, like, draw blood and have scabs from doing that? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  I did, man.  You're talking about on the outside, right?  Of course.  Yeah, where you just did.  You know something?  I do remember some chafing.  I never used the okie-dokie method.  Uncertainty-dokie method.  I never used that.  You never used the o-tay, Jerk?  No, no, I never used that.  I always used it.  Boom and forefinger together.  O-tay.  It was always the full-on.  Hey, Joe, you remember this Nerf football of Anthony's?  The what? 
[00:31:00]  The Nerf football that he used?  No, that was something like, I just, I found it laying around and just kind of...  Nerf football.  Yeah, you know, and then you just lube stuff up and go to town.  Whatever worked.  Oh, my God.  I didn't care whatever worked.  No, I have, I must say, right now I have an absolutely gorgeous girlfriend and I, and  still, I mean, yeah, still.  Sorry, man.  You still do it, right?  Of course.  Joe, jerk.  All right, Joe.  Joe, Joe. 
[00:31:30]  What?  Did you get Pete Townsend's number yet?  I was going to look into that.  Hey, you know who's playing at the Kings Club tonight in Centering?  I don't know, it's just kind of non-sequitur, but that Corey guy.  Look at Joe, all of a sudden saying something I have no idea why he's talking about.  You were doing so well on the jacking.  You were doing so well.  I was almost saying, this can't be my brother calling because he's doing so well.  And then he goes into something that I don't even understand.  Joe, you realize we're syndicated now, right? 
[00:32:00]  And there's 20-some-odd cities listening to something you're telling me that I wouldn't  even know what you're telling me all over my cell phone.  And meanwhile, this is going out over many cities, Joseph.  Okay.  All right.  Well, now we need to know.  They suck.  Hold on.  We need to know.  I'm in the words of Jim Thornton, I stink.  Hold on, now we need to know.  Now, who is he?  Who's Corey?  It's Corey Feldman, and I'm going with a bunch of guys from the tattoo place and the bike  place down to the Kings Club in Centering, which is where he's playing.  Is Corey Feldman like from Corey Feldman? 
[00:32:30]  From the Goni's.  Oh.  Well.  You know that little place?  I'm sorry, 22 cities.  It's the little place next door to the sushi joint we go to.  Oh, yeah.  Tiny little asshole of a club.  And he's playing there.  Oh, Joe.  Yeah.  All right, look.  Oh, that's funny.  I got him.  I think we saved the first break.  I think so.  We almost lost it with Joe's call.  And almost lost in the end there. 
[00:33:00]  There's a guy on the MacGyver of pleasure tools.  Make sure he goes nowhere.  MacGyver.  The phones have exploded, so we'll go with this a little bit.  And also a little alert.  New contestants up on opiananthony.com.  Yes.  For the WoW contest.  You want to play the trainable thing?  Oh, remember this, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  This is great.  Want to set it up real fast?  Retard training film.  It's like a sex for retards training film that came out in the, I guess, late 60s.  They used to call them trainables. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, they called them trainables.  Which means they weren't too retarded.  You can still train them a little bit.  Yeah, but they seem pretty goddamn retarded in this movie.  I don't know what level trainable is.  But this clip is a mom.  Is it the one walking in?  On her son.  On her son.  She does the knock walk.  And then she has to explain to the son to make him not feel guilty and whatnot.  In a manner that a retard will understand.  The mother sounds a bit retarded herself.  She sounds like a stepford wife.  Jimmy, did your mom sound like this?  When she walked in, this is the, Jimmy's got a mouthful of honeydew. 
[00:34:00]  No.  My mom didn't say anything.  She actually closed the door.  And she walked out.  Perhaps she should have done this, then.  Did she feel like you were cheating on her?  Oh, God.  You know.  That is just inappropriate.  You know, I didn't want to get into making it hot talk.  So inappropriate.  You know, I took a chance there because we never went that way with Jim.  And he accepted it.  Thank you.  Of course.  I will allow you to make fun of my mother one time today.  Oh, dude, there's nothing that bugs me more than Jim goes, 
[00:34:30]  Hey, dude, that's my mother.  I know.  Yeah, well, F you and F her.  Talk about whatever you want.  I'll give you one, though.  Make it a good one, though.  I'll make fun of your mom.  One good one sometime during the show.  What kind of dirtbag would make fun of his friend's mother?  You dick.  Here's the audio.  Many people believe that important elements of sex education  are social behavior and responsibilities.  Social acceptability involves being comfortable with one's own sexuality. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, excuse me, Ricky.  Ricky, I did see what you were doing.  It felt good, didn't it? 
[00:35:30]  It's all right.  We all have feelings like this sometimes.  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room.  When you're a little bit older, we'll have to talk more about these feelings  and what causes them and how we can control these feelings.  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy.  I'll be sure to knock next time.  Okay?  This manner of response frees the child of guilt 
[00:36:00]  and assures him he is normal.  It opens communication between parent and child  and introduces the concept of responsibility for his behavior.  So remember, guns don't kill people.  Dangerous minorities do.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It just doesn't get any worse than this.  The Victor Zebra finishing after Zeppelin plays. 
[00:36:30]  Pretty much what you're going to be getting.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got to go right back to the phone.  They have exploded.  Good word.  Good choice of words for this topic.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, we're talking about taking care of yourself.  Right?  Yeah.  Being a little creative. 
[00:37:00]  As a kid, you know, hormones are raging.  You're just cranking it whenever you can.  Like I said, I know me.  There were sometimes five times a day, man,  until it got to hurt, where it was hurting,  but you just couldn't stop, where you had to hold it up yourself.  Right.  Anywhere.  I remember once as a kid, I went out the back door of the house.  Notice I said it that way.  I went out the back door of the house. 
[00:37:30]  It had to be about 1 in the morning,  just so I could crank it outside in the dark.  What was the name of your house, Richard?  With the wind blowing.  Shut up.  Nothing better than the nice breeze blowing across your damn bag.  The nature jack.  You never did the nature jack?  Many times.  I love the smell of paint in the morning.  Out in the woods.  Out in the woods.  In the Long Island.  In the tree fort.  In the tree fort. 
[00:38:00]  Facing south.  Almost like Michael Skakel.  Up in that tree, just pounding away.  Wait, there were no houses around my tree fort.  No.  Middle of nowhere.  All right, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Files?  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Calling himself the MacGyver of taking care of yourself.  And that is absolutely true.  All right.  Give us some of the things you've done.  Well, to start off, I almost drove off the road when I heard what you said about the nerve  football because, you know, the booster clubs at the old high school football games used  to do, like, give out those footballs so you could buy them. 
[00:38:30]  Sure.  I had one of those, and I did the same exact thing.  I hollowed it out, but I got a little bit more creative.  I took a, I was rummaging through my father's nightstand, and I found an old rubber, and  I used that.  I put that inside to kind of lubricate the foam so it wasn't so rough.  Wow.  And then I also got to the point where I wanted some of that, you know, old 70s mama muff,  so I went to the hairbrush and pulled out all the loose hair from my, and I taped it  on top of the thing so it looked a little bit more realistic.  Get out of here.  I swear to God, dude. 
[00:39:00]  That's classic.  That is no joke.  And I also have done the cantaloupe thing.  That worked pretty well.  Yeah.  But the whole banana, I don't know if that would hold together there, Petunia.  It didn't work.  I was a pack and a half, and I felt silly.  Yeah, you never want to feel silly when you're about to do that.  Silver duct tape on a banana.  There's no way to make that sexy.  But seriously, like, I mean, I used to get so into it.  Like, I'd rummage through the house.  Like, all right, I've done that.  Now what else can I do, you know?  So I'd rummage around for circular objects, you know, tubular things like the inside of the 
[00:39:30]  toilet paper roll.  I would do the same thing, like, just looking around the house.  You're alone in the house.  Oh.  And I would go on a scavenger hunt for something to use to Jack.  I tried the toilet paper roll.  The toilet paper roll.  Yeah.  I mean, it was just always something laying around.  You just got to get creative and say, well, you know, I got five minutes to spare.  Maybe I can find something deep and tubular that I can, you know.  Some kind of roll.  I tried that, though, and I'm like, man, she's slutty.  I was like, man, I'm small.  What the hell is she doing when I'm not with her? 
[00:40:00]  You know what?  Wow, the toilet paper roll is big.  Yeah.  Well, hey, the toilet paper roll is big.  Some of us aren't as gifted as you.  When I was 14, and look, now I have to defend myself.  When I was 13, 14, yeah.  Hell yeah.  But I also had something to say about getting locked down.  I had my greatest growth after high school, Anthony.  Now, let me tell you about the toilet paper roll.  Here's what I did with the toilet paper roll, because you can't just use a toilet paper roll.  It's a little rough.  It's a little rough.  Right.  You take a baggie, and you put the toilet paper roll in the baggie.  Then you put some toilet paper around the outside of the baggie, in between the baggie and the toilet paper roll. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Then you just drip warm water in there.  Now you got yourself a nice little warm place.  I'm impressed.  I never thought of that.  Yeah.  See, we're sharing ideas, MacGyver.  We're on the same level.  All right, Chris.  All right, man.  Take it easy, guys.  Yes, Norton.  You know what else is for it?  You got a girl who used her mouth.  That works.  A little, you know, slim pickings at that age.  And you needed, put it this way, the only girl that would have been available that much was one that you took prisoner and handcuffed to your bed. 
[00:41:00]  Because it was, like I said, five times a day.  Didn't matter.  Seth, what's going on?  Yeah.  One of the better ones to use?  Yeah.  A jar of peanut butter.  You're lying.  No lie.  Don't use Chunky.  Of course don't use Chunky.  Stuff in your mule.  A jar?  Very safe.  You would go to town with a jar of peanut butter?  Don't use Chunky.  See, that's odd, though, because you know what it is? 
[00:41:30]  You don't want anything getting in anywhere.  Yeah.  You didn't want anything getting in anywhere.  One time.  I don't buy that.  One time in the shower, I was using a shampoo.  You got to use a conditioner.  Everyone knows that.  I was using the shampoo.  Shampoo gives you the sting afterwards.  When something gets into some places.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  The pain.  They made doing it again an hour later really difficult.  Conditioner always.  Never shampoo.  Conditioner. 
[00:42:00]  And never use aloe.  Never use, like, a lotion.  Does it have aloe in it?  No.  It burns.  Aloe burns?  Yes.  Remember that.  It's aloe.  We're getting some great instant feedback.  Chris, when I was 13, I used to, hmm, I used to TF two water balloons.  Junkmail Jerry, home with an ear infection and was cranking to Sigourney Weaver's underwear  scene in Alien.  Couldn't hear anything and Mom walks in. 
[00:42:30]  Worst day of my life.  Dan from Hoboken.  Underwear scene in Alien.  How quick was that?  That scene, like, took two seconds.  He was 13.  That's all the time he needed, right.  As long as you can time it right.  We talked about the timing.  Yeah.  You got to time it and know that she's going to reach up at that moment.  And the shirt lifts up and you see her hands.  Yeah.  Dan, going back to Anthony and his Nerf football, Dan from Hoboken, was the Nerf football named  Richard, Anthony?  No, it wasn't.  And he also wants to know, or he writes here, Ed was going out with footballs while his mom 
[00:43:00]  was going out with football players.  Ouch.  No, that was...  Strange but true.  Oh, yeah, she...  Yeah, okay.  You know, it was a good video to Jack, too.  It's amazing how back then, the innocent stuff would get...  Back then, when Jackin was like now, only back when men will...  You're like dinosaurs.  You're here.  I hear me.  I was...  Crimson and Clover video by Joan Jett.  Anything that had a good ass shot in it, Pat Benatar's video.  That had a good ass shot?  Yeah, music videos were pretty good, but the thing is, the choppy direction, that never 
[00:43:30]  left it up on the screen for more than two seconds.  Some of them did, though.  If they would have that, it's amazing.  That was enough.  You just did a little dance like you were playing air guitar and you shook your ass.  I was showing you that that's how they were playing.  Oh, okay.  But you didn't really need to show us.  Yeah, we already know.  I can't help it.  A little ass shake.  A awful image in our heads of you dancing with that cute little air guitar.  Oh, man.  A new-beasted man dancing to a song.  Oh, my God.  Eddie, who's a Dominican.  Eddie, what's up?  Yeah, yeah.  What up, baby?  Yeah, kid.  Yo, listen.  Back in D.R., by the rivers and stuff, you know, they got the planting trees. 
[00:44:00]  They got like a soft bark.  Yeah.  You make a hole in it, and you just...  Right there, you do it.  A tree.  Yeah, it's all dirty.  You should know about this.  It's a planting tree.  It's not a hard tree.  It's kind of soft.  And you put a hole in the tree?  You put a hole in the tree, bro.  And you know where else?  All dirty.  Give us a call.  You know where else?  By the river, you know, it's like kind of muddy.  Yeah.  All right.  You put some mud on the side.  Wait till it gets a little bit hard. 
[00:44:30]  You mold it, and you just lay on the floor.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  All right.  Thanks for bashing apart your stereotypes.  Listen, listen, white boy.  Relax, okay?  Relax yourself.  Yeah.  You know what else, man?  No.  When you...  Hello?  Yeah.  When you freaking land in your bed watching porn or something, I got caught up plenty of  times on my mind.  But you know what I hate?  What?  They come in, they catch your jacket, and they try to play it off like they didn't see nothing.  Did that ever happen to you guys? 
[00:45:00]  Well, no.  Never caught.  I got caught once, and my mom just walked back out.  She did the same thing.  Yeah, exactly.  You try to play it off like they didn't see nothing.  Well, what was she supposed to do?  Boy, you've gotten big.  I'm glad she left.  And one time...  Oh, no.  One time, I went in the shower.  Oh, boy.  You know when you just...  Listen, listen.  You know when you're in the shower?  Yeah.  After you, you know, you finish, and it gets wet, it gets kind of white and like...  Like, focus.  You leave it running around.  Yeah.  My father called me there, too.  He came on.  I was just finishing a shower.  We brought him back in the shower.  I was like, oh, what is that? 
[00:45:30]  His phone is annoying.  Eddie.  What up?  Thank you, though, Eddie.  Eddie, I'm going to teach you something.  What?  You should have stuck with your first story.  The tree.  It was strong.  It was to the point.  It was like you would have left a hero.  I suck.  I think.  It's not that you suck, but then you had to follow it up with two lamer stories.  I suck.  You always finish strong.  All right.  All right.  The tree.  You want me to do the tree thing again?  No.  No, no, no, no.  All right, all right.  Later, guys.  We got a girl checking in on instant feedback.  Jennifer from Queens says, I used a computer mouse the first time. 
[00:46:00]  The round ball felt really good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's kind of hot because, you know, she was probably looking at some pictures,  and she's rubbing the ball of the mouse.  Mike, what's up?  Ew.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  I got a few things.  The first one's going to blow your mind if you ever try it.  You know when you go to the beach and you go in one of the little stores and you get  that little cylindrical thing that's made of, like, a... 
[00:46:30]  I've banged that before.  I know exactly what he's talking about.  It's like a balloon and a little water.  It's like a thick balloon, but it's in a tube.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me explain it to everybody, Mike.  It's like a thick, tubular balloon filled with liquid, but it's not solid.  There's a hole through the middle of it, and it's really hard to hold on to.  Do you ever have someone throw you one of these things and you grab it,  and if you squeeze it, it shoots out of your hand one way or the other? 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  I am so lost.  The second I saw one, I went, I'm going to F that.  I looked at it and went, this is perfect.  Great minds think alike, sir.  Wait, help me out, though.  I'm lost.  All right, give me a pen.  Give me a pen.  I'll draw you a cross-section.  And what was this?  They went by names of water, water weenie, hard-to-hold thing.  Yeah, sometimes they have the little dolphins or something.  I won't be put in the middle of it.  So it's just a thick, elongated balloon, right?  Absolutely. 
[00:47:30]  Here's what.  So what would you do?  Well, wait a minute.  Here's what it would look like.  You'll put K-Y-Tillion in the middle.  You'll cut it in half.  It was like this.  Hole went right through the middle, yet it would go in on itself.  It would do this.  It would go like this and in a continuous loop.  Okay, okay.  So you could.  I don't remember that growing up.  Oh, the second I saw it, it was love at first sight.  I'm like, I am taking you home and I am effing you.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus.  That's classic. 
[00:48:00]  And, boys, I have another great thing for you, if you want to hear about it.  Frenchie's balloon knot.  She's a stupid faggot.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  See you, Petunia.  All right.  It was called a water snake.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, those are great.  I got the visual, though.  Byron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yo, I was wondering, do you guys ever have a failed session?  One where you're going for like 10 minutes, just sweating.  You just don't know what to do, whether to keep going or stop. 
[00:48:30]  Let me tell you.  You lazy bastard.  No.  When I begin that, I have to end that.  Finish the job.  You have to.  I've gone at it for like over an hour.  No joke.  Right through the cage.  Because at that point, I'm like, I am now obsessed with getting the job done.  You've got to get the job done.  That's a good work ethic.  And I wake up the next day, and it feels like it's going to fall off.  But I got to go the distance.  All right.  And my interesting place, between the mattress and the box spring on a bed. 
[00:49:00]  I've tried that once.  It didn't work.  I did try that once.  I did it once.  And when my mom was flipping the mattress, there was a speak.  You know what the problem with that is?  It's like, man, I'm doing a fat girl.  Fat, soft girl.  All right.  All right, boys.  Later.  Wow.  Ty from Delaware brings up a great point.  What about doing it at other people's houses?  That's the lowest.  You ever do the out-of-your-own-house jerk?  Yeah.  I'm trying to think where.  On my friend's bathroom floor, the first time I ever saw a porno, it was called The 
[00:49:30]  Fur Trap, starring Kelly Mint.  The Fur Trap.  It really was.  Yeah.  And I couldn't handle it.  We were sitting in his parents' room on the floor just watching it.  I had to be like, I'll be right back.  And I went into the bathroom.  I laid on the cold tile floor, and I just made a complete spectacle of myself.  I could not stop myself.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Tom.  I can't believe this.  Trees and mattresses, you guys are nuts.  Nah, I think you're not.  If you're going to use something that's going to be warm and nice, I'm going to tell you 
[00:50:00]  something, okay?  All right.  Potato salad.  This is real stuff.  That's like doing a girl with an SUV.  Hold on, hold on.  Potato salad in a plastic container.  You put saran wrap in it.  You lube it up, and you microwave it.  It's got to be warm.  So there's saran wrap between you and the potato salad?  Right.  I don't know.  Lumpy ain't good.  I wouldn't want to bang it.  No, no.  At least it's warm and smooth, not a mattress.  You eat it later.  You work up quite a hunger.  How does the mayonnaise get in there?  Ah, very funny. 
[00:50:30]  I can't get into any food products or any of that stuff.  I, uh, I, uh, other people's houses, Opie.  There was one time I had a very hot cousin back in the olden days.  Dude, I don't like when you talk about your hot cousin.  It's just a cousin.  Yeah, but it's kind of weird, man.  Very hot.  Very hot.  But you've said stuff in the past.  You and your brother really thought you was hot.  I never did anything.  In a hot way.  Never did anything.  I understand that.  With her.  I've never looked at any of my cousins and said, wow, they're hot.  You might not have a hot cousin. 
[00:51:00]  They're hot.  No, I was looking.  And like I said, again, let me reiterate, I was young and so horned up that I would do  it everywhere, anytime.  So I went over, I was visiting their house.  Hold on.  I got to get into this a little bit.  Yes.  I got to ask you an honest question.  Now we're going back many years.  Uh-huh.  Let's say we're going back 20 years.  Right.  So you're safe now because it's a long time ago.  Uh-huh.  If this cousin said, uh, do you want to have sex, would you?  Now?  No, way back then.  Oh, back then? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, we probably would have fooled around.  First cousin?  Yeah.  Wow.  I would have.  That is weird.  I don't care.  Does this person listen to the show?  Uh, I don't know if we're in that market.  Oh, no.  We're close to it, I think.  I think it's just at the fringes of the signal.  And you would have had no problem with that?  No, I'm not saying no problem.  Looking back, it's hard to say.  You know, awkward kid thing.  But, uh, who knows?  Maybe.  I think so.  That's being honest. 
[00:52:00]  I was crazed.  I was crazed.  All right, back to the story.  So I was at visiting their house, you know, and, uh, I was using the bathroom that was  off of her bedroom.  And I look on the floor and she had taken her clothes off and left them strewn on the  floor just as she had taken it off.  And it got me so worked up that that's how the clothes dropped when she was completely  nude that I just had, I right then, I just had a pound one out looking at the pile of  clothing on the floor. 
[00:52:30]  I was insane.  It was like you were playing Pac-Man.  Waka, waka, waka, waka.  It was.  I saw it.  And the way the clothes were, I was like, that's exactly how the clothes dropped off  as she was just completely naked right there.  How did you not sniff the, uh, how did you not bury her face?  No, I didn't pick anything up.  I was paranoid that they would see that it was effed with.  No, I understand.  Don't make that sniffing face disgusting.  Just leave over and sniff and be a good boy.  I'm with him, though, man.  I understand what he's saying.  I said a lot.  But you don't have to go to that extent.  No.  Because what's already happened, there is a more of a, it is a turn on. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, it was just, and then it gave me the mental image of the, of the bathroom and the shower  stall and the clothing and everything.  That was just, oh, perfect.  No, touching them would have done it for me.  I stole panties off the neighbor's back thing once.  You're that guy.  And I'm not a fetish guy, either.  On videotape, you see Jim Norton running across.  There he is.  I videotaped because my panties were disappearing.  I would wrap my mule in them and, and.  You would?  Did that friction kind of hurt?  No, it was silk.  Yeah, I can't lean.  I've done that, too. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Put him on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Billy.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Bill.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Not much.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  What do you got, bro?  You're on.  Well, you guys have been talking about what you've done, you know, what you've done it with.  Yeah.  Well, I've done it in some pretty effed up places. 
[00:54:00]  I've done it in front of my sister.  What?  Yeah, she was in the same room.  She was in a towel, and I was on a couch, and I was whacking away.  To your sister.  See, that is sick.  Good boy.  The cousin thing.  I did it in the movie theater twice.  The movie theater was full.  I was watching Wild Things, and the other one was Titanic.  Of course, Kate Winslet was buck naked.  Hey, dude, did your sister see you?  I hope not.  I don't think she did. 
[00:54:30]  Hey, that's pretty cool.  You did it in the theater watching Wild Things.  I was watching a WWF pay-per-view, and remember Sonny?  Yeah, from WWF.  Sonny, how much he was?  Yeah.  Well, I was at my buddy's house, and she came on TV, and I put a pillow over my crotch and started whacking away.  Nice.  Very nice.  Yeah, I'm pretty messed up in the head.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  One more, and then you know what we have to do?  Because we've got to bring the hotness back to the show. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  We've got to hear from the ladies next.  Yeah.  Enough with the guys.  Ladies.  I'll say.  We've got a couple ladies already on hold that want to talk about it a bit, so stay there if you're calling in, ladies.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mike.  The worst thing happened to me.  I've been married less than a year.  My wife walks in as I'm taking care of the AM lumber.  The AM lumber.  The morning wood, yes.  It was ridiculous.  She started smashing plates, throwing things at me, calling me a sick ass. 
[00:55:30]  Did you call her a guinea brat?  I had no defense.  Godfather.  I hadn't even finished yet.  What does that do for your day?  Why do the ladies get mad if they catch you?  I don't get it.  She thought it was sick.  She said, I'm only in the next room.  Why can't you come do that to me?  I like that.  She was more worried about how she was feeling versus what was going on with my morning issues.  You have a nice marriage ahead of you.  Now she wants to leave me and take half my stuff with her.  That's weird.  Sometimes I like just being by myself. 
[00:56:00]  You know, you wake up, you got a kickstand growing.  What are you going to do?  All right, Mike.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Then you don't have to worry about her needs.  Yeah.  Her needs.  You don't want to look at her stupid face.  Sometimes it's great to just pop in a porno and finish and not have to hear,  shut up.  You're right, though.  Of course I'm right.  That's reality, man.  I've already whacked it to some of the contestants on opanthony.com.  Wow.  Have you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to think.  Is it Raven from the Big Wazoo in Columbus? 
[00:56:30]  Shut up.  Was it?  No?  Shut up.  No?  No.  Actually, I'll admit it was flame.  Was it Gemini from YSP?  Now you've gone too far.  Sometimes you just don't want to hear.  When I'm finishing, I want them out fast, man.  I want to be alone.  Yeah, but that's because you're just having sex to have sex.  Why else does anybody do it?  I've explained it like this.  Guys want to have just sex. 
[00:57:00]  Well, they want to make love.  And sometimes they just want to have sex.  When do they want to make love, Martha Stewart?  When do we want to make love?  If you're in love with your chick, of course you do.  But other times, then you just want to have.  Make some of that love.  I want to hang a rope ladder out my window, and as I'm finishing, put them on it and ask  them to leave.  A fireman's pole.  Get on it.  You're lubed up enough.  Goodbye.  Leave a little stripe down the pole.  Throw a purse and panty out the window after.  I truly believe this is why a lot of couples have problems in their relationship, because 
[00:57:30]  I can talk for a guy.  I can't talk for the ladies out there.  But guys want two types of sex.  They want to make love to a lady they're in love with, and sometimes they just want to  F.  I just picture the half-naked girl hopping on one foot as she tries to get the strap to  her high heel on the other one, as the strap is flying out Jim Norton's window.  You've got to go.  You've got to go.  Once you just have one of those big, huge police airbags on the street, and you just  push them out the window. 
[00:58:00]  Save time.  A few stories, yeah.  Bend her out the window, and she's like, wow, I'm out.  Oh, no, it's all right.  I'm holding on.  I'm holding on.  Then you just lift the feet and tip it.  Jesus.  All right.  But that will break, I guess.  Right.  Yeah, ladies.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNAW.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You should know that by now.  God, I hope you know that by now.  Oh, my God. 
[00:59:00]  We got two girls outside the studio that will be entering the WOW contest and representing  New York.  One girl.  I didn't see the other one that just came down.  I hear she's hot, too.  This one girl used to go to our road shows when we first moved back to New York.  Yeah.  She would drive our listeners absolutely batty.  She has the hugest boobs I've ever seen in my life.  And I think they're natural, right? 
[00:59:30]  She was at Webster Hall driving the crowd nuts.  Yeah.  One of our first road shows ever.  And I got to tell you, I jacked it to her.  You jacked it.  Oh, yeah.  The pictures were up on FoundryMusic.com.  Thank you, FoundryMusic.com, giving me some of the best jacking material ever.  She's hot, right?  Or is that the other girl that just came down?  What other girl?  I hear the show out there.  Oh, boy.  You want to see Lisa now?  That one is...  Yeah, bring Lisa. 
[01:00:00]  Are they real?  She was about a Bing girl, too.  And ladies...  Hold on.  Ladies on hold, stay there.  We are going to you.  We got some great calls on hold.  And by the way, when we go back to the phones, everyone knows what we're talking about here.  We're responsible broadcasters.  Right.  So you don't have to give too much detail.  Yeah, we know what we're talking about, so just keep it vague, but let us know.  There she is, Lisa.  Lisa.  And she just told us something interesting.  She's now doing extra work, and she's about a Bing girl, Anthony.  About a Bing girl on The Sopranos, right?  The one with the antlers on. 
[01:00:30]  The antlers during what?  The Christmas episode.  And what did you have to do?  I was about a Bing girl.  Dancing.  You're dancing around up on the stage?  Yeah.  Any speaking roles in there?  No, not yet.  Just dancing around.  I do remember that, though.  I remember the antlers.  She's been naked on The Sopranos many times now.  No, not naked.  Topless.  Topless.  Well, that's naked for me.  Holy mackerel.  She's really hot.  What a looker.  That's Jim Norton.  He loves you.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  You should write that down now. 
[01:01:00]  This, man, you are going to be a favorite in the WOW Contest.  I'll say.  Hell yeah.  Rick, you all geared up for the photo shoot?  Rick, I think you might have to do this photo shoot inside the studio.  Yeah.  What do you think?  We just want to make sure the pictures are done right.  Well, for that to happen, the lighting has to be perfect.  All right.  I've got the lighting pretty well worked out there.  Why don't you work on the lighting?  Maybe she could get ready and you could take some test shots and make sure everything's  okay.  Well, we can do some test shots in here.  Sure.  That's correct.  Not like a one-on-one.  Hmm? 
[01:01:30]  One-on-one.  You used to get, like, naked in front, well, topless, excuse me, in front of, like, a thousand  of our listeners back in the day.  Yeah.  Not only that, dude.  She's topless on TV.  Yeah.  And then she stopped coming around because I think someone in her family had a problem  with her hanging out with us.  My mom just loves me too much.  Is that it?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But she...  I had permission today to be here.  Oh, good.  I got to ask, just because it's radio, how big are those?  Double D. 34 double D.  34 double D.  Wow.  Oh, boy, are they?  Oh, boy. 
[01:02:00]  Lovely.  All right, Rick, why don't you get the job done?  Yeah.  Well, would you wow, ma'am?  No.  We'll make sure...  I'm not ready for that yet.  We'll make sure we do a short break here so we can make sure the photo shoot's going  well.  Right.  Right.  Are you going to be on The Sopranos this coming season?  This year, yeah.  I just finished doing filming for them and Sex and the City in July.  Are you topless in Sex and the City?  No.  No?  No.  What are you doing for Sex and the City?  Just extra work. 
[01:02:30]  Kind of in the background stuff?  Yeah.  All right.  You have to start somewhere.  Rick, she said she's not going to do it in here.  She wants one-on-one.  Hold on, one.  We've got to respect her.  You guys make me nervous.  Really?  Yeah, because we're asses.  See?  What's this wee crap white man?  To all the ladies out there, don't be scared.  We're learning.  We're going to try not to be as...  We're learning.  ...as much of an a-hole as we have.  We've been to anger management.  Yeah.  We're trying.  We're trying to be better, okay?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:03:00]  Well, at least go have fun, and we'll talk to you after.  Yeah, okay.  You're done.  See you later.  All right.  There she goes.  She's beautiful.  I'll be proud that she's representing New York.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Nothing.  What's wrong?  Nothing at all?  Why?  Why?  Why would you want any chick to wow in studio?  I don't know.  Oh, Jimmy's a little upset with her.  Jimmy's a little upset with her.  It's just our principal who cares.  This one's a key...  Don't ruin it for the listeners.  You don't want to throw this one back. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not throwing it back.  Sometimes you've got to negotiate.  We will sacrifice a nice wow in the studio, knowing that she's going to be completely topless  for about, I don't know, a half million of our listeners.  For our listeners.  And us.  And me.  The weekend's upon us, you know.  I need new stuff.  Jim, it's no big deal.  I just hate people in general.  I spent $75 last night, and that's exactly what I should be doing.  That's exactly...  What?  I had to go to... 
[01:04:00]  It was $75 last night.  Oh, you got one?  Yes.  Where do you pick up girls these days?  This one was on 54th and Broad.  Wow.  Yeah?  Yeah, black girl.  Hot.  Sure, it was a girl this time, right?  Yeah.  Was she one of those drive-by whores?  No, no, no.  She was walking.  They had the drive-by once.  Now, how did you tell, like...  No, dude.  It's all vibe.  You just know?  Ah, certain things in people just really bug me.  Like, she's walking down the street.  Wait, wait.  I got to go back.  She's just uncomfortable. 
[01:04:30]  I understand.  She would probably do it if she...  I don't care.  She's nervous, because she...  And I are intimidating for whatever reason when they come in here.  With some taunting, she would have done it, but...  Yeah, we could have probably made it happen.  I don't care.  The girl last night was really, really...  What, Rick?  What, Rick?  You guys want to meet Wendy?  Oh, my God.  She showed up.  This girl's been emailing us.  Finger in.  This girl has a website.  Wow.  You showed up.  Yeah, I showed up.  I told you I would.  Hi.  We have a winner.  Hi.  Hi, Wendy.  Hi.  How are you guys? 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  What's the name of your website?  WendyJune.com.  This girl is beyond beautiful.  Thank you.  Beyond beautiful.  Wow.  And you guys are all very good-looking yourselves.  Look at that.  What a diplomat.  She's very diplomatic.  Jim, why don't you ask her?  Jim's not happy right now, because the last girl that came in here wouldn't wow real fast.  Thank you.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, we got a winner.  Sorry, Dallas.  We just took the title. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  You're aces with me.  Oh, my God.  You look like someone famous, but I can't figure it out.  Who have you been told?  That you look like.  I don't know.  Anyone?  No?  Doesn't she look like someone famous, but I can't figure it out.  Oh, my goodness.  Very pretty.  Huh?  Oh, Tiffany Amber.  A little bit.  Yeah, okay.  I can see that.  Oh, she's better looking.  Well, yeah.  I'm not blonde.  I'm not blonde.  You're obviously a model.  Yes, I am.  There you go.  Our first model, Anthony.  I finished a photo shoot for a catalog for Lingerie Company. 
[01:06:00]  Lingerie Catalog.  Yeah.  Those are always great.  Those were good in a pinch back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  Right?  The Lingerie Catalog.  Sure.  Well, Rick, why don't you get working, because she's going to just destroy our show today.  Yeah.  Rick, are you a little intimidated?  The girl's a model.  She's had professional photographers taking her picture, and now you're going to be doing  things, and she's going to be like, oh, I'm working with an amateur.  Sure.  No, no, no.  I think I can mold her to what I need.  So you feel pretty confident about yourself, don't you? 
[01:06:30]  Yes, I do.  Very confident.  Hey, name the website again, because a lot of our listeners would like to get a sneak  peek.  Oh, it's wendyjune.com.  wendyjune.com.  That's the girl that is in our studio now, entering the WOW contest.  And then the shots of what Rick takes will be up on opandanthony.com later today.  Every single shot will end up on foundry.  Yeah, this is another one of those where Rick's going to take about 100 pictures.  We'll have every angle possible.  Did that make you happier?  Very beautiful. 
[01:07:00]  Thank you.  Very nice.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  All right, we'll talk to you in a little bit there.  Oh, my goodness.  wendyjune.com.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  I'm on wendyjune.com.  Wow.  Look at the pictures.  The little thumbnails you can't click on because, you know, it costs you some cake.  I hear you.  You know, but the thumbnails.  Very nice.  Are they sexless or just naked?  Nude.  She's, you know, well, not nude, but I just see her in a bikini and stuff.  Big fan of the show.  Cool.  She's very beautiful. 
[01:07:30]  I thought someone was pulling her a leg because she emailed us and said she's coming in.  I'm like, yeah, all right, whatever.  Where'd you get this picture from?  She goes, you'll see.  It's me, and I like you guys, and I want in on the contest.  Is that the hottest girl you've ever seen in here?  Wow.  She's very beautiful, man.  She really is.  Name a girl that's hotter than that that has showed up in this studio.  I don't know if I've seen a hotter girl than that in this studio, to be honest with you.  Brunette.  It looks like she has, like, blue eyes, crystal blue eyes.  Very nice.  Anthony, speaking of which, there's about seven new girls up on opianthony.com for the WOW Contest. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Columbus making a huge comeback.  Huge comeback.  I don't know what happened.  Something happened in Columbus.  I'm looking at a couple of really hot girls from Columbus.  She does look a little like Carol Ault.  Someone is saying that on the instant feedback, but this girl's hotter than Carol Ault.  Look at that, right?  Look at that.  That's a pretty, pretty hot girl there.  Yes.  From Columbus.  Hey, Ben, go to opianthony.com. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, Columbus gave us about five new girls.  Chicago gave us another new one, I think.  What do we got?  Let's go there really fast.  We're up to about 55 contestants.  We're looking for 100 before the voting begins, Anthony.  Now, you know something?  We're at the halfway mark, and I think we're seeing a little more quality.  Yes, the girls are starting to come out of the woodwork.  Columbus gave us one, two, three, four, five new girls.  Yeah.  And they're all lovely.  Chicago just gave us a brand new girl.  Contestant number 50, Andy. 
[01:09:00]  Very, very nice.  Daisy from Philly.  Not too shabby.  From Philly.  Contestant number 49.  I'm saying not too shabby because the lighting in that shot is a little rough,  and I can't really see her, but she looks pretty good from here.  Mm-hmm.  Riskayvideo.com has given us $5,000.  Eventually, one of these girls will walk away with $5,000.  And Ann and I are working on the sales staff here.  We're trying to get more stuff involved in this contest.  Yeah.  A couple of more prizes.  A couple more, you know, throwing a few more bones there.  $5,000 is nice, but we're trying to, like, you know, make it a little better. 
[01:09:30]  Up the ante.  Up the ante, yes.  So there you have it.  Go to opanthony.com for the latest contestants in the WOW contest.  And once again, there's a lot of tools out there.  They're e-mailing every day.  How do I vote?  There's no way.  You can't vote if you go to opanthony.com.  The voting has not begun yet.  No.  And we're not going to start voting for at least another week or two.  At least.  Because we want 100 women in this contest.  What are you laughing at, Ben?  Sure. 
[01:10:00]  What?  Sure it'll only be a week.  I said at least.  You know what we're trying to do is we're trying to put together just a huge, like, road show  and we fly in all the finalists.  Right.  But we don't know if we can pull that off yet.  That's what we really want to do.  And that would be in, I don't know, in August sometime.  Just have a huge party and parade these girls out.  Yeah.  The place would lose their effing minds.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Those two girls just threw us off track, Ant. 
[01:10:30]  They sure did.  We have a lot of ladies on hold.  Ladies, please, we need you.  So stay right there.  They're going to talk about some of the things they used when they were growing up and they  had to take care of business.  I'm reading a few things.  Wow.  The girls are just as creative as the guys.  Some very hot stuff on the way.  The Opie and Anthony M. U. Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.

I make a fool of myself every time I try.  Stick them up.  All right.  I'll try again.  Karashi.  Karashi.  Close. 
[01:11:30]  That's good.  Rick is such a tool.  Rick is in the middle of a photo shoot.  I got to tell you, man.  We're going to lose him soon.  It's a penthouse, playboy, or swank.  He's getting really good at this.  But he's such a tool.  You see the concentration, though?  Oh, I know.  It's hilarious.  We got a couple of naked girls outside the studio entering the WOW Contest.  And he has named some of his poses.  That's what I'm saying he's such a tool for. 
[01:12:00]  There is a professional model out there.  He's photographing her.  Now, she's in front of professional photographers every day.  She does lingerie catalogs.  You know, you're talking people that have been photographers their whole career.  Rick, all of a sudden, is posing her.  And he goes, yeah, this one I call the Britney Spears.  And I just turned around.  Me and Garrett, we were playing foosball.  We just stopped and went, what a dick.  What?  The Britney Spears? 
[01:12:30]  But he's dead serious.  Oh, he is.  He says it straight face.  And what is the Britney Spears, Rick?  The Britney Spears is a pose where the girl sits at the edge of the table or chair.  Yeah.  She has her legs apart.  Uh-huh.  And she kind of drops her elbows towards the inside of her legs.  Okay.  And kind of works up her shoulders as her bountiful breasts jump forward.  That is the Britney Spears.  It's off a goddamn album cover that you probably have at home that you whacked it to.  I just like the fact that you named your poses. 
[01:13:00]  What other poses have you named?  I've got the Jesus Christ pose.  Oh, yeah.  He does.  This is the Hobrick Snob pose.  I like this one.  My personal favorite.  Why don't some of the girls get to do all these poses, Rick?  Um, because sometimes we're short on time.  Why didn't Flame get the Britney Spears pose?  You know what?  I would have loved to do that pose.  I wasn't here for Flame.  All right.  Let's grab a rope and do the JonBenet.  It's classic.  Her name is Wendy June.  Wendy June. 
[01:13:30]  Wendy June.  You can go to foundrymusic.com.  Steve has already linked her website.  Is she topless out there?  Of course.  She's great.  Professional mom.  She don't give a crap.  Oh, there we go.  Hey, there she is.  Wow.  Amazing.  Everyone becomes speechless.  Oh, Ali has decided he's got to come down again.  What a coincidence.  Only when there's beautiful naked girls down here does Ali have work to do.  Hey, Wendy, did Rick do a good job with you?  He did a great job.  Rick's not done, though.  How many pictures have you taken?  I only have 50 so far. 
[01:14:00]  That's it?  That's it.  Yeah, that might happen.  So I need a couple more.  Yeah, we've got to get our pictures up, though.  People are yelling at us through the instant feedback.  We want some pics.  At first, I thought our brand-new consultant here at WNEW, John Minnelli, had moved his offices  back here by the studios to be more in touch with the programs that are on and give his  advice as to what would be best in midday slot.  Once you get John Minnelli in here, he's consulting the station here in New York City.  Continue in.  He picked the office right next to the studio with a huge glass window in front that just 
[01:14:30]  overlooks the area that all these photo shoots happen in.  He's left his office in haste.  Oh, he ran out.  See?  I knew it.  He heard us talking.  I think we just found the new midday host.  Yeah, why doesn't he look at some of these girls?  Maybe they have potential to be in the new midday show.  Imagine following her every day.  Oh, how about that?  There wouldn't be an angry bone in our bodies.  What?  Can I do it topless? 
[01:15:00]  That would be mandatory, yes.  Of course.  Yes.  That's part of the job description.  I prefer a dancer when she's really shy.  Jim cannot get over that.  Jim has a real problem with Lisa.  No, I don't have a problem with her as a person.  I'm sure she's a nice girl.  I just...  She's a little shy.  I know.  I should walk into a comedy club one time and just stand on stage and go, be funny.  Oh, no.  That's all right.  That's stupid with that.  Hey, Rick, we've got to move on with the show, unfortunately.  Yeah.  So, finish up your work, Rick. 
[01:15:30]  Come up with some, what, do you have a Christina Aguilera pose or...  No?  Nothing like that?  No, but I've got some others that I'm working on, so...  Have there been some that doesn't work?  The Don Corleone where you put an orange wedge in her mouth and have a go...  No?  Rick looks and just goes, well, that one's not that sexy.  Stop your spilling it.  For flame, that probably would have worked.  That might have worked. 
[01:16:00]  All right, there they go.  All right.  Thank you very much.  WendyJune.com.  Check out her website.  Beautiful.  Wendy, no panties.  You got it.  All right, Rick, go ahead.  Have some more fun.  Doesn't she look good leaving the studio, too?  How about that?  Rick's got great timing.  He was in Europe watching Aha! when flame came in.  Yeah.  Comes back to work and he gets to shoot WendyJune.  Yeah.  Wendy is hot.  How about that?  Okay, Candy. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Candy.  Hello.  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, baby.  Well, when I was a kid, I used to use a couple of kitchen items.  There was this, I guess you could say it was like a chicken roaster type of thing.  And I used to use that.  That was, like I see, the first thing I'd seen, I was like, this could be amazing, you  know?  And then there was another thing that I used, which is a little strange.  I used a Ken doll.  A Ken doll?  Uh-huh. 
[01:17:00]  Head or feet?  Head.  Ken doll's head?  Yeah.  Was he holding his nose when you pulled him out?  I mean, it was the closest thing I can get to a guy, so.  Yeah.  So where did it end?  The neck?  The chest?  Where?  Oh, just up to the neck.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, up to the neck?  Okay.  Yeah.  That was, he was like my favorite.  I was like, this could be interesting.  All right.  You ever try a G.I. Joe with a Kung Fu grip?  No.  Just that Kung Fu grip hand staying on the outside, just kind of squeezing away at things? 
[01:17:30]  Uh-huh.  Sure.  With the lifelike hair?  Remember that one?  Yeah.  All right, Candy.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Candy.  She ain't going to fall for it.  Well, look at that.  She's, uh...  Janet, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Janet.  I'm telling you guys, no, that women do not want to make love all the time.  You're right.  We do not.  We do not.  Sometimes when I, you know, I want...  Well, I'm not sure that'll get through. 
[01:18:00]  See, that's the type of speaking that will not get through on this program.  Oh, man.  That was really hard.  Sometimes you just want a good banging.  It's true.  None of the lovey-dovey stuff to it.  Exactly.  That's cool.  That's always good, too.  Sometimes just, uh, you know, down and dirty.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  I'll let you guys go.  Bye.  A lot of ladies calling in.  Cool.  Haley.  Hello?  What's up?  All righty. 
[01:18:30]  I have a good one for you.  All right.  Um, I was seeing this guy and it was the sex date, but of course only the girl knows  that it's the sex date, not the guy.  You knew at this point it was the sex date?  It's always the girl that knows.  Come on.  Let me be honest here.  Oh, my God.  So you went, oh.  How hot is that?  Oh, wow.  That is great.  Let's be honest.  It's the girl that knows.  Yeah, we know.  Wait, so you girls call it the sex date?  Of course.  You know that's the date that it's going to happen.  So when he picks you up, no matter what he does that night, he's getting some. 
[01:19:00]  That's the sex date.  You know, there's these idiots out there that are trying all night long, but they're not  the sex date.  But it's not the sex date and the girl knows it.  Got it.  Okay.  Only a rapist knows when it's the sex date.  Absolutely.  You're a guy.  Every time.  This is a sex date, bitch.  Whether you like it or not.  Go ahead, Haley.  Roofies.  All right.  So it was a sex date and we're out to dinner and I'm thinking, oh, this is a sex date.  I'm thinking all about that, right?  Mm-hmm.  So we get back to his place and like all night long I'm thinking about it, so I'm going 
[01:19:30]  crazy at this point.  I had to ask where the bathroom was.  I'm like, I'll be right back.  And I did it right there in his bathroom.  You, you, now why would you do that if you knew it was the sex date and you'd be having  some anyway?  Because I couldn't wait for that.  I had to do that first.  Then I was home.  She was so worked up.  Exactly.  She was so worked up that she had to take care of herself before the sex.  So how long after you took care of yourself did you actually do it with the guy?  Oh, I don't know.  It was like half an hour. 
[01:20:00]  Half an hour later.  Yeah.  That's a hot story.  And how was the...  By then, it was awesome by then because I was already, you know...  Ready to go, let's just say.  Ready to go.  There you go.  Wow.  Hey, thank you.  Thanks for sharing, Haley.  You're very welcome.  Very nice.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Damaris, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hi, hi, hi.  Shut up.  Well, there's no white girls in my neighborhood called Damaris.  I know, I know.  You know, I mean, it's a Greek name, though, but I'm not Greek. 
[01:20:30]  What are you?  Puerto Rican.  Hey, hi, hi.  Yeah.  Hi, now.  What's up?  Hi.  Norton.  Hello.  I love Puerto Rican women.  Somebody told Norton that he knows who I am.  Do I know who you are?  Yeah.  How do I know who you are?  AOL.  Jesus.  Oh, don't say your screen name over the air, but I guess I, uh, all right.  It ends in...  Oh.  Well.  Was I nice to you on the computer?  Yeah, you were like, show me some more cans. 
[01:21:00]  Did I really?  Bigot, Wendy, June.  I'm sorry.  Well, first of all, excuse me.  Damaris, what...  Oh, you sent me a link to your homepage, right?  Yeah, that's me.  Oh, I remember you.  Yeah, she's nice.  Now, she's cool.  She's fat?  No, she's not fat at all.  She's thick.  Not at all.  Damaris, how much do you weigh?  Oh, like 160.  Yeah, she's good.  160?  Nice.  How tall? 
[01:21:30]  5'5".  Oh, boy.  I don't even have to pull the chart.  I don't even have to go to my chart.  Oh, come on.  I'm going to stick it up and go throw in the bag.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Thick.  Good for spanking.  Yeah.  Nice.  I like big bucks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I gave my friend a lot to answer that song.  I like big bucks.  Were you doing the flut dance?  Yeah, I was.  Were you just sick ass up and down and back and forth and make you go in circles? 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  Do you hang out in BBW rooms?  No, you...  I might have once or twice.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right, so what do you got?  Well, no.  For the past few weeks, I've been kind of, you know, at work.  So I go to the bathroom and I, you know, help myself out.  Right.  And, but yesterday, what happened to me was I got so dizzy and I got so faint-ish that  I had to lie down. 
[01:22:30]  You had to lie down?  I had to lie down.  I was dizzy.  I was nauseous.  And finally, my supervisor found me in the bathroom and she's like, are you all right?  So she went to, she took me to the doctor's office and she's like, lay down.  And they sent me home because I couldn't work.  And because you got yourself so worked up by taking care of yourself?  It was so good.  Yeah.  It was so good.  That's not what I called.  I was going to say about Mickey Mouse.  Maybe you need a sandwich.  Oh, man.  You're bad.  You guys are bad.  That, uh, going out. 
[01:23:00]  It's like, what to do, take care of myself or eat.  That's a tough one.  No, like Morton said before, you're bored at work.  You don't know what else to do, so you're good at that.  So what about Mickey Mouse?  Well, I don't remember what age.  Maybe like early to like 12, 11.  I used to take Mickey Mouse's nose and I don't know if I could say this, ride.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Take care of yourself.  Mickey Mouse's nose.  Do your thing.  Uh-huh.  You know, you work it.  Later at night, I kept saying, Mom has to be asleep, you know. 
[01:23:30]  Not here.  And after a few months, years, Mom kind of was like, hmm, Mickey Mouse.  I don't know, but come away.  He kind of smells funny.  Oh, Jesus.  Mickey Mouse smells funny.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, how about that?  She used her Mickey Mouse style.  Very creative.  All right.  I dated a girl who actually had like a little bear like that, like a Mickey Mouse, but from  childhood, and she would use the bear for the same thing. 
[01:24:00]  Right.  You know, with face scrubbing.  And now she still has it, and she's like, go ahead, give the bear a kiss.  And I'm like, I don't want to kiss the bear.  Oh, my God.  But I did.  Of course you did.  I'm a nice guy.  You kiss the bear.  You kiss where the bear goes.  Women can do that, guys.  Just behind where the bear goes.  Women can use that little, you know, stuffed animal.  All right, Tamaris.  Okay, guys.  Say hi to Jack Black for us, okay?  Oh, stop.  You're mean.  Thank you, Tamaris. 
[01:24:30]  Jim just got it.  It's unnecessary.  Why?  She's a nice girl.  She's fine.  She took it.  She was nice.  Right?  165.5.  Help me out here, Jim.  I see what you're doing, but I'll try to call you out on you and go, what?  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not.  Yeah, okay.  Charlie, what's up?  I'd just like you guys to please keep the talking to a minimum.  I'm driving home in my work van right now, trying to have relations with myself, some  of these beautiful stories from these ladies, and every time Norton tells a little story, 
[01:25:00]  it just kills me.  Good.  You shouldn't be whacking your bag doing 50 anyway.  You're going to paralyze someone because you can't wait a half hour.  Well, anyway, just keep the talking to a minimum.  The girls are doing fine today for a change.  Thank you.  I'm out.  All right.  Yeah, the girls are doing great today.  Calls are, yeah.  Tina, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Tina.  How you guys doing?  All right.  So, you guys were talking about that stuff before, so I just had to go and, you know,  finish myself off earlier today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  But anyway, what I wanted to say was that when I was younger, you know, it's sort of  like, you know, a little baby with a plug.  You just try and put anything you can in there.  So, you know those Crayola markers that are, like, kind of big?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, that was, like, creative, you know.  A Crayola marker.  Yeah, because you don't have access to that much stuff, so.  Right.  Right.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  That's what I was saying.  When you're a kid, you've just got to kind of make your own way in the world and look  around, see what suits you best, and use it. 
[01:26:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  But the message that I want to send to, you know, all the women out there is detachable  shower heads.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The ones that come off the wall and they've got the hose and you can put them anywhere.  Oh, absolutely.  I discovered it in Europe because all the showers are like that.  Yeah.  And they need to have more in the U.S.  I really think so.  Do you put it on the heavy massage mode?  Absolutely.  You have to, you know, twist it a little bit to get it the right speed.  It's like an anti-aircraft gun.  Yeah, totally. 
[01:26:30]  Just smacking away.  You'll never know until you do this that the pattern of the water changes.  Oh, it does, does it?  Yes, you have to, like, move it around and stuff.  Wow.  How about that?  Very nice, Tina.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That must be something.  Picture that through the steamy shower door.  Now, you can just tell that the way she's standing, a little bit like a cowboy, you know,  and what she's doing, a hand down there, and just an arched back, just maybe a hand against  the wall that's dripping with the steam, her upper heart pressed against the shower  door, hearing the low moans over the sound of the shower. 
[01:27:00]  Remember Kentucky Fried movie?  Yeah.  High school, yeah, Catholic high school, girls in trouble.  Yeah, shower, it's hot, it's hot.  Teresa, what's going on?  Let's see if it's in, like, the 1970s.  Me, Teresa?  It's not water, it's gas.  Oh, hold on.  Teresa, what's up?  I just wanted to let you know that it's funny, because I listen to you guys on the right  home, and one of my favorite places to get off, I have a straightaway, almost right 
[01:27:30]  turn on, right before I have to turn and change gears.  You guys were talking about it, you went into commercial break, you found me a good tune  on the radio, and just before I hit the corner, kaboom!  I just wanted to call and say, thanks.  Oh, yeah, when I'm jamming them gears.  Hey, it's a great day, I don't know what it is, but maybe it's just the stress of the  day, but that is the spot.  All right.  It just seems to work best.  Right on, cool.  Have a good one.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Hmm.  We're just about done here.  So that was, Anna brings up, oh, you went direct? 
[01:28:00]  No, go, go, go, go, go.  Anna brings up a point, because when I, when that deodorant tickle first came out, remember  the bottle tickle?  No, I didn't do anything with it.  When I, when I saw it, I was thinking, I'm like, what the heck, where's he going with  this one?  Tickle.  There was a roll-on deodorant.  Look, man, I got an open mind, but I'm like, what, what is, where's he going with this?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's a roll-on deodorant.  Hey, this is in my roll-on, it's, it's shoe polish. 
[01:28:30]  It's shoe polish.  Remember the old shoe polish?  Look just like it.  It's a shoe polish.  What happened to my deodorant?  It smells funny.  No, I never used that.  But when it came out, it was called tickle, and the bottle itself was shaped, even with  the lid on, like a big fat dill. 
[01:29:00]  And all I thought of was, wow, girls are going to get a double use out of this thing.  And she brings up the fact that she, uh, she used to use that.  Tickle.  But they hung up on her, or something.  That's classic.  Hey, Phil, what's going on?  Hey, just a quick question.  Remember the, uh, famous tape from the AF days?  When the chick calls up, and she's basically popping wet and puts it right to the phone,  asks if you want to hear.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  That was a great one.  You've heard that before?  No, I've done that before.  I love that.  No, no, no, no, no.  There's a, there's a tape out there that we cannot play on the radio anymore. 
[01:29:30]  We got away with it one time.  And actually, the unedited version, uh, made its way to the internet.  It is unbelievable.  Absolutely sickening.  You guys go, wow, you, Anthony, you freak.  I freaked out.  This girl was watching, uh, porno.  She's watching a porno, and she's fantasizing about the girl in the porno being with her.  She looks so good.  She looks so good.  Oh, my God.  Phil, Phil, Phil.  Yeah.  And she's, uh, she's screaming to the girl, oh, yeah, I want it.  I love your, and then she would describe what it was the girl and what was going on. 
[01:30:00]  And her areas and everything.  And, uh, she goes, oh, my God, look at that.  And she just worked herself up into a frenzy.  And when she finally let loose, it was like an animal.  She was grunting.  And it was amazing.  I don't, I gotta try to, I forgot all about that.  Yeah.  I think I got a copy somewhere of that.  It's on the internet everywhere.  Yeah, I've seen it on the internet, and it's an unedited version, because she's cursing  through the whole thing.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  It really is an unbelievable piece of volume. 
[01:30:30]  Can you get away with it?  You want to edit it?  We couldn't play two seconds of that.  No.  No.  No way.  Phil, let me tell you, times have changed a little bit.  A little.  We got away with that one back then.  We can't do that today.  You are.  Oh, well.  All right.  Thanks for the memory, boys.  Unfortunately, we got a little too big for ourselves.  Yeah.  Back then, no one paid attention to us, so we could do stuff like that.  Let me hear it.  Let me hear it.  Dude.  Oh, really?  You do that?  Like muddy boots.  Like boots.  Waterlogged.  Rubber boots.  In the muck.  I'm in a quagmire, Jim. 
[01:31:00]  Just trudging through the swamp.  I love that.  That's funny.  You know, that was the time that Bruce walked in.  B-b-boys.  The shwaggy guy.  Yeah.  B-b-b-boys.  What are we doing?  A talk show now?  What are we doing, boys?  A talk show?  I'm sure a lot of guys want to hear a girl moaning.  For 40 straight minutes?  For 40 minutes, boys.  Perhaps we ought to get back to the music, b-b-b-b-boys. 
[01:31:30]  After all, it's called the only station that really rocks, boys.  Not the only station that really talks.  B-b-b-b-boys.  You see the playlist in front of you.  Stick to it, boys.  How many songs are you dropping today, boys, so a girl can moan?  You don't get it, do you, Brucey?  Brucey, you don't get it, do you?  B-b-b-boys.  I guess this bit's going right over your head, Bruce.  Oh, everything goes over your head, you midget.  He used to come in and go, what is this, a talk show, boys? 
[01:32:00]  Hey, it's working out pretty good for us now, Bruce.  Bruce Mittman, I'd like to introduce you to Rich Voss.  Who's this gigantic man?  B-b-b-b-b-b-boo.  Our show has flipped completely around.  You know those little snippets of music we play going into every break?  Yeah.  That's equivalent to how much time we were able to talk back in the old days.  Yeah, they don't allow you to talk.  And now all there's talking here is all the music we used to play.  We used to have to play.  And then we slowly started turning it around. 
[01:32:30]  B-b-b-boys, you only played five songs today.  Boys.  What am I going to do with you, boys?  I don't understand this, boys.  Perhaps you had a job on RKO.  Maybe I should send you boys in for shock treatment.  All right.  Little fidget.  Oh, my God, these girls are going nuts.  I know.  Nice. 
[01:33:00]  There's some killer phone calls that we've got to get to.  I want to get to them, yeah.  Ladies, be patient.  Just one more break for us, okay?  We've got to catch up a bit here.  We'll go to the F.U. line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, F.U. to my job, my boss, my truck, F.U. division, the F.U. in hot weather, the goddamn  best seat-sucking whore who won't get out of my goddamn way.  F.U. everybody.  Peace.  Next message.  I want to get a big F.U. to the bitch who lives on the third floor who keeps waking me up at 4 o'clock in the morning when my daughter's sleeping. 
[01:33:30]  F.U. you fat bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. is from Gray Davis and the so-called government of the state of California.  You took 10% of everything I made last year and another 10% on top of everything I bought last year. 
[01:34:00]  And you're telling me that you can't afford a bus to send my kids to school?  What the f*** are you spending this money on?  You've got an economy bigger than every nation out there except for seven of them.  Malaysia can afford an army and can send their kids to school?  You're telling me you're f***ing broke?  F*** you!  End of messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  W.U. N.E.W. 
[01:34:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'd like the representation today.  A couple girls came down here for their pictures.  Thank God.  Our latest contestants in the WOW Contest.  Looking really good.  I'm telling you, we've got to throw a bash.  An old-fashioned roadshow with all these girls.  Bring them all up on stage.  Like the top 20, you know what I mean?  Bring them all on stage.  The place will lose their minds. 
[01:35:00]  So, you went to that Tickle website there?  Yeah, Tickle Deodorant.  It was a commercial that was on during, I guess, the 70s, 80s, somewhere around there.  And, yeah, I saw the little bottle again.  Oh, it brings back such memories.  Well, no.  What did you do with this?  I did nothing with it.  But, like I said, the ad itself was like porno.  The commercial for it.  Right.  Because the girl's holding this Tickle bottle that was shaped just like a dill. 
[01:35:30]  And they're going, yeah, dryness never felt so good.  Like they promoted it like that.  Like you could use it for other things.  And apparently girls were.  A lot of the products out there in the supermarkets have, you know, a double purpose.  Of course.  Who was talking about that fudge hair product?  Oh, God, that was Brittany, right?  Brittany from the first Big Brother.  Right. 
[01:36:00]  Brittany.  And she would use fudge hair dye.  Right.  Because the bottles that came in was a dill.  A nice fit.  Right.  Lori, what's going on today?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to tell you guys, you guys were talking about moms walking in on you.  Yeah.  I was like 16 and I was sitting there and I wasn't allowed to have the door open.  And my mom's calling me for dinner and I'm like, oh, God, please don't come down.  Please don't come down.  Please don't come down.  And she walks me down and I'm sitting there on the floor, you know, pants down on my ankles. 
[01:36:30]  And she freaks out and starts screaming at me and crying and runs down the hall.  That is so hot.  She thinks you were weird?  Oh, yeah.  She's one of those, like, really, really strong Catholics.  Oh.  You know what?  Daughters that are raised in families that are really strong Catholics, some of the biggest whores I ever known, man.  Unbelievable.  Un-effing believable.  I knew a family man just packed with daughters, all of them hot.  And they were raised such strict Catholics that, and they were all just banging everyone. 
[01:37:00]  It was amazing.  Could you tell the story?  Are you done, Lori?  Well, yeah.  That was pretty much it.  No, that's a good story.  How old were you?  I was 16 then.  I'm 23 now.  That's great.  Very nice.  Thank you, Lori.  Thank you.  Can you tell the story about your old girlfriend and all you guys did was F and the father would drop her off, not knowing what his daughter was getting into every afternoon?  He was pretty much a pimp. 
[01:37:30]  And he was pimping.  And he didn't even know it.  Big pimp.  He was pimping.  He was pimping his daughter, yeah.  He didn't know, though.  He didn't know.  It was classic.  We were boyfriend and girlfriend.  She was 16.  I don't even know how old I was.  I guess I was 18.  What did he think was going on when he dropped her off every afternoon?  It was just she was coming over my house to hang out.  And what he didn't know was it was on the weekends, you know, Friday night, Saturday night, she would come over. 
[01:38:00]  And she didn't have a car or anything, so her father would drive her over to my house, lived in a very nice suburban neighborhood of Northport, Long Island.  And my mother, though, worked Friday and Saturday nights.  She was a waitress at Chaz, that disco out on Long Island.  So she was gone from 9 at night until 5 in the morning.  And I guess the father didn't know this, so there were parties going on like crazy every weekend at my house.  And the father would wheel her up to the house in his plumbing van, because he was a plumber, and let her out. 
[01:38:30]  Speaking of plumbing, a little plumbing, and then I'd go, yeah, lay in some pipe.  And we'd have to get right to it, because she would only have a couple of hours there, and then she'd get picked up again.  We'd just come in like a drop-off, you know, a little get-together.  He assumed my parents were home or something.  And so we had to get right to business.  So the second she got dropped off, like, boom, you'd hear the motor pull away, and the clothes were flying off, you know, running to the bedroom. 
[01:39:00]  And then things would happen.  And then we'd look at the clock and go, okay, get dressed again.  And he'd pull back up and pick her up.  You'd hear the squeaky brakes.  You know, you'd just know the sounds of a vehicle after a while.  You'd hear the squeaky brakes.  And he'd look at you funny, like, all right, dude, I know what's going on here.  Heffing hated me.  First of all, I was older than her by two years, so he really had a problem with that.  And it was, you know, 16 to 18 is kind of a big two years.  You know what I mean? 
[01:39:30]  The guy at 18 and a girl at 16, she's just coming into maturity.  And the guy at 18 is like, you know, just rocking.  He's already rocking.  He'd been 18 before.  He's already rocking.  So he knew what an 18-year-old guy is like.  And he had a talk with me once.  He goes, why don't you take a ride to the store with me once?  We're hanging out at her house.  We're just sitting around.  He goes, why don't you take a ride to the store with me?  And I'm like, oh, no.  I was so scared.  And I'm just sitting there as he's like, you know, my daughter's very important to me. 
[01:40:00]  And you're a little older than her.  And I just want to make sure that nothing happens that's going to get her in trouble or anything.  And it was almost pregnancy.  Yeah, well, that or anything, I guess.  Drugs, you know, anything.  And it was so uncomfortable.  I'm just sitting there going, this is the longest drive to 7-Eleven I've ever had.  You should have said, no, don't worry.  She swallows.  Yeah.  You know something?  You do think things like that in your head, though. 
[01:40:30]  I've had the worst experience.  That's why I think after I turned 20, I wrote off going out with girls with fathers.  I like girls without the fathers.  I had another one, this girl out in Smithtown.  This girl, Lisa.  And she had a father that was the biggest prick.  And he, I, to this day, I believe he was in love with his daughter in an inappropriate way.  Not that he did anything, but just the relationship there. 
[01:41:00]  I believe he was in love with his daughter and didn't want anybody going out with her.  And then here comes me.  I'm a slob.  You know, I've got my, my hair looks like it was combed with an M80.  And I'm smoking pot.  I'm just a wreck.  And here it is, his little girl that he adores.  And he found out that I visited her up at Quinnipiac College once.  And he lost his effing mind.  And he sits me down in the living room and just is pacing back and forth.  And he looked like he had the horseshoe bald head where he just had the hair around the edge. 
[01:41:30]  The Hulk Hogan?  Little mustache.  Yeah.  And he's just yelling at me, yelling at me.  Let me tell you.  And I just remember him saying this.  And as I'm sitting there, I go, what does that mean?  He's going, let me tell you something, my fine-feathered friend.  And all I could think is, I don't have feathers.  Like, it just blew me away.  My fine-feathered friend.  You do not go doing things like that with my daughter.  And I'm just like, oh, you should see the way she effs Jesus Christ. 
[01:42:00]  No, I didn't say that in my head, though.  You know, you get those thoughts.  In real life, I'm like, okay.  I hated being a kid, man, because I was so intimidated by adults that in situations like that,  instead of standing up and going, why don't you go eff yourself, man?  She's relatively an adult.  She's in college.  He was worried that you guys were going to get married or something or get too serious?  He thought, because he used to go to a bar that my mother tended bar at,  that all these stories, that I was going to be spreading stories around to people that he knew. 
[01:42:30]  I gotcha.  And he was very upset with this and was like, if I hear things and, like,  because I guess my mother had said something like, oh, yeah, my son went to visit your daughter.  So all of a sudden, the word's out that, you know, oh, my God,  everyone knows these sordid details about her relationships.  And he's yelling at me.  But I was such a pussy, man.  I just sat there.  He did the right thing, dude.  It's so bad.  But as I'm leaving, I just felt, like, beaten and emasculated.  Dude, you were banging her. 
[01:43:00]  You won.  Who cares if the great Santini yelled at you?  You won.  You threw a basketball off my head.  Come on, sports fans.  Squirt them.  You banged his daughter.  You're the winner.  I love the great Santini.  How can you not?  Such a great movie.  Hey, breaking news on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, Christ.  Wendy June's pictures are up on O.P. and Anthony.com.  Our latest contestant representing New York City.  Just go to O.P. and Anthony.com and check it out for yourself.  And she wants to plug something. 
[01:43:30]  Right, Wendy?  Yep.  Jim Maroney's motorcycle shop.  We're having a bikini car wash on Saturday for NDA.  So if you're over that way with your bikes, come get it washed.  I'll be there.  Where is this place?  In Newburgh, New York.  Newburgh, New York this weekend?  Yeah.  Saturday.  Tomorrow.  And she's charitable, too.  Yes.  And your pictures are up on O.P. and Anthony.com and they came out very nice.  Thanks.  Very nice.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Wendy. 
[01:44:00]  She gives a little wave.  Cute little wave.  There she goes.  Is this yours?  No.  You suck.  You are three to three with Art Norton.  You are so horrible.  Katie.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Katie.  So let it be said that embarrassing, pleasuring yourself stories do not contain just to the men.  Okay.  For pain, I should say, just to the men.  Okay.  I lived in a sorority house.  Well, let it first be said that I did not find my mouse button until I was about 18. 
[01:44:30]  So I was in a sorority house where you didn't have any privacy anywhere.  So my roommate was gone for the night.  So I decided, you know, I'd make it a little special.  I got a little addicted after I found it at 18, let's say.  And so I put on some Dave Matthews.  I grabbed a brush.  What kind of brush?  Well, I put a condom. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Slow down just in case they dumped out of that.  Yeah.  You put a bed, you put a, she prepared the hairbrush.  Yeah.  For action.  We don't even have to get that.  There you go.  All right.  So you used that.  Okay.  So I'm like, you know, listen to this Dave Matthews.  I'm under the covers.  Doing your thing.  That's all you need to say.  Yeah.  And my, my, my, my pants were down by my ankles.  And my roommate walks in.  And she sees the Dave Matthews and she saw like the shock look on my face. 
[01:45:30]  And she's like, what's going on?  Are you okay?  And I tried to start to like cry and say that like, I was so upset about like, I don't know,  moving into the house or whatever.  But it was, but it was, yeah, the face you were making was of sheer pleasure.  Well, sheer pleasure mixed with mortal embarrassment mixed with sheer shock.  That rocks.  And the thing that sucked actually was that the phone rang just as soon as she came in. 
[01:46:00]  And the phone was right near my bed, but it wasn't like close enough that I could reach  over without like uncovering myself.  I'm hoping for the best.  Yes.  Go ahead, Katie.  And then.  Who turned out to be on the phone?  What's that?  I figure if the story's going to meander, I might as well ask every detail.  God almighty, Katie.  All right, you're in.  Dave Matthews stinks to begin with.  So the phone is ringing and obviously you can't answer because you're naked under the 
[01:46:30]  covers, right?  How are you going to get that?  And I kind of like got up and then she saw like, like the side, like underneath, like  my side and saw that it wasn't closed.  And she's like, okay, I'll get it.  Never mind.  I'll get it.  Oh, she was on to you then.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  Wow.  So.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mucs.  We didn't really talk about it after that.  All right, Katie.  Thank you.  Then what happened?  And then, and then.  And then, and then.  And then. 
[01:47:00]  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Like, great.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  This was college, right, Katie?  Yes, sir.  You forgot to include your major and SAT scores.  Your curriculum.  And your minor.  Anything else you'd like to know? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, Katie, we're just messing around.  Well, get a hold of yourself.  We're just joshing.  We're just joking.  A bunch of guys just having fun.  Oh, I know.  I enjoyed your story.  Yeah, it was a nice sorority story.  Keep the stories shorter, my fine-feathered friend.  You could have made it a little shorter.  You turned it into a three-part miniseries.  Well, I just, I don't know.  Coming up next week, the phone rings.  I was just so excited to hear.  What can I say?  That's cool.  All right, whatever.  No, thank you, Katie.  Uh-huh.  It was the last emperor of sex stories. 
[01:48:00]  Thank you, Katie.  Bye.  I felt like I was watching Falcon Crest.  Oh, it was endless.  And then she was going to come home earlier, but she had to stop at the things.  Well, I thought I had time.  The brush had exactly 852 bristles.  I counted them.  Scott, what's going on?  Uh, I'm on the website.  Okay.  And, uh, are you really into that, Rack?  Uh, Wendy June? 
[01:48:30]  Come on, now.  Talk to me.  She's a sexy girl, man.  Come on, talk to me.  I think, uh, she's sexy all around, yeah.  North by Northwest.  Let me, let me.  Horrible.  Nice face.  Horrible Rack.  Let me take a look again.  Maybe Rick.  Look at the last.  Look at the last shot.  Maybe Rick took, uh, some bad shots there.  Look at the Britney Spears, the last shot.  All right, let's go to the Britney Spears shot.  That's not the Britney Spears.  No, the Britney Spears isn't in there.  That's not the Britney Spears.  It's the modified Britney.  Go to the last shot.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  You know, come on.  That's not bad, man.  You see.  Oh, B.  Have you seen, uh, the other girls representing New York?  Good point, O.  All right.  You know, it just got, my opinion of the whole thing is, um, I think the implants, she, I'm  not a big fan of the implants.  I'm not.  I'd rather have cute, uh, little perkies, um, than have implants.  That girl's got a chance at this contest.  Of course you have a chance.  I'm telling you right now.  Yeah.  Right? 
[01:49:30]  Shot.  That's a hot shot.  And they don't look like Steve Buscemi's eyes, whoever wrote that.  You idiot.  And Mr. Deeds.  Marty Feldman.  They're a hot shot.  Ethan from Jersey.  Columbus, once the laughing stock of the WOW contest, now has some of the finalists.  Check out 52 and 55.  Hot.  Yeah.  Got to agree with him there.  He makes a valid argument.  All right.  We should move on to other things, because, um. 
[01:50:00]  Steve Buscemi's stepping up, Blake.  I guess we got to blame the sorority girl.  She wrecked it for everybody.  Oh, God.  That's what happens with these discussions.  It does, though.  You're right.  Good, sexy talk.  That's when you know to just, uh, back off.  Back off.  Got a little wet blanket on the whole thing.  Although, Kelly does seem very clever with this one.  On line one, national.  I'm looking.  That's very clever.  That's something not many people have used, I think.  Kelly?  Hello.  Hi.  What did you used to use to take care of yourself?  This was a one-time thing, because I realized how weird it was. 
[01:50:30]  I went out and bought a regular vibrator, but, um, it was the motor on my filter to my fish  tank.  I noticed that it was, uh, kind of shaking a little bit good there.  Now we'll never get the smell out of those fish.  That old gag.  Hilarious.  This had been dead.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, remember those, uh, the pumps?  Yeah.  Of course.  They blow the air on.  It would go.  Oh, okay.  The square thing that sat under the fish tank and then the rubber tube went up into the, 
[01:51:00]  uh, actual filter.  Right.  But, uh, yeah, those things are, and they vibrated.  Which one of those little weird mechanical devices?  Didn't any of you girls have a puppy?  A puppy and a little peanut butter?  Yeah.  Maybe a little milk.  All of a sudden, everyone yelled, surprise!  Oh, damn it.  I hate when that happens.  All right.  Thank you, Kelly.  Mm-hmm.  Very clever, though.  That's good.  This bit is running out of steam.  Bye, Kel.  Let's see if Laura can save it.  Laura, go ahead. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey!  Listen, man, I'll tell you what.  When I was in high school, right, and you're going to like this because I was a Catholic school  girl.  Mm-hmm.  So, uh, you know, Catholic parents, you can't really have anything laying around the house,  but I got a little ingenious and figured out how to use the pager.  Oh, the vibrate function?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of girls have, uh, said they use that one.  Oh.  Kind of smash it against there and just let a rip call yourself up?  Yep.  All right, Laura, thank you.  That's what we're done all about.  Thank you. 
[01:52:00]  Love you, Norton.  Love you.  Bye.  Hey!  That's what it's all about.  That's what that's all about.  I'd use the pager.  Yep.  I'd put it down there and that's what redial's all about.  Give myself a little jingle.  It was kind of funny looking.  Larry.  Yo!  Larry!  Hey, how you guys doing?  You're going to find your dog down in the hallway, Larry.  This is Larry, the Vietnam vet from, uh, Stoner Smelling Day.  Oh, Larry!  Larry!  We're in his garage with, uh, with old Betsy.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, buddy? 
[01:52:30]  Hey, man, hey, O&A, remember when you guys were talking about, you know, satisfying yourself?  Yeah.  I was 16 years old.  This is the honest God's truth.  Did you wrap a gookie around it?  Now, come on, Jim.  I'm serious, man.  Yeah, damn sure.  So I was 16, and I had a friend of mine who was 16, and his mother was really hot.  Mm-hmm.  And you, you just knew that she was hot and adventurous, you know what I mean?  Adventurous.  That's a good word.  So, uh, they had one of them above-ground pools, you know what I mean?  So we were up there one day, and he, you know, he's in the pool and that, and out of my clear blue sky, I said, hey, I said, I called him Skip. 
[01:53:00]  I said, Skip, I'm going to go inside and go to the bathroom.  So I went upstairs, right?  Mm-hmm.  Just on radio or just you and me?  Oh, this is going out over many cities.  Well, I don't care.  So you ready?  So I go in his mother's bedroom.  Yeah.  Hey, this is bad old anthem.  Okay.  And I went through to start and opened the drawer, you know?  Hey, I was 16, you know what I mean? 
[01:53:30]  And, uh, I opened the drawer that had her panties in and brawls in there.  I'm not talking cotton panties, I'm talking the satin smooth stuff.  The sexy ones.  Yeah.  And then she had, like, a three-pack.  They were a pink, a blue, and a yellow.  All right.  So, so you know what I did?  Yeah.  You know, I sat in, you know what I did?  Okay.  In the pink pair.  You took care of yourself.  In the pink pair.  In the pink pair.  Now, let me finish.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:54:00]  That's great.  He arced one in the panties and then put it on the right hand on.  Okay, you're right, Jim.  I arced it in, you know what I mean?  All right, yeah.  We know what you mean, Larry.  Now, listen, I had a 55 Chevy at the time.  Two months later, she would always cruise at night, this kid's mother.  10, 11 o'clock, she would go out in the car and cruise.  She was married, too.  Give him a flashback.  Wow. 
[01:54:30]  Come on, Larry.  So, you know what I ended up doing?  Huh?  I met her one night, talked her into going in my 55 Chevy, and I had her in the front seat.  And I swear to God, a mom and dad's grave, you know?  When I was done with her, I told her about the pink panties.  Oh.  Yep.  I was 16.  She was about, I'd say 32.  Turned off.  32.  But she was good.  She was hot.  She wanted the younger one.  I like that story, Larry. 
[01:55:00]  It's the truth.  You haven't given enough details, though.  What do you want me to do?  Let me get it.  What do you want me else to say?  Is she hot?  What does she look like?  I'd say about 5'6", 5'7".  Yeah.  Not skinny.  Uh-huh.  Not skinny, not fat.  Kind of just there.  She was there.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And she always wore stockings or pantyhose every time I'd seen her with a skirt. 
[01:55:30]  Did she give you a Hummer?  And her blouse, every time I'd seen her, whatever she was wearing, she was a hot woman.  Yeah.  Tell us more, Larry.  And apparently she liked younger guys.  Tell us more.  We're really getting into this.  Huh?  Tell us more.  We're really getting into this.  And she was just, you know, kind of rude.  Get off the tracks, Larry.  And I did for a while before I get down her bedroom.  Larry, look out for the train.  I'd go home at night or after I'd seen her.  Larry, look behind you.  Look out.  You're standing around on the tracks. 
[01:56:00]  Larry, Larry.  Behind you, Larry.  You're on the tracks.  Larry, that was the most horrendous train wreck I think I've ever witnessed.  Larry?  Oh, Larry.  Larry?  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Larry?  Larry?  Larry?  Hello, Larry.  With Agent Orange stuff.  Hello, Larry.  Yeah, we got to talk about that next, Michael.  MTV True Life.  I'm coming out.  An awful show.  How would it not be?  An awful show.  We'll talk about it next time, Michael.  I'm coming out.  Also, we got a sucks to be you guys. 
[01:57:00]  A double sucks to be you at the same time.  Nude lovers are found dead with car running.  Ah.  How stupid.  You deserve to die if you're this stupid.  Yes, Rick?  What?  Lisa was feeling up to wowing, so she wanted to do that for you guys.  Will this help you out, Jim?  That's all good.  All right.  You made it feel bad.  I don't want to make it feel bad.  Oh, look at the big wow shirt on and everything.  Yeah, there you go.  Wait, this Lisa's picture is going to be up, those lovely 34 double B's. 
[01:57:30]  Any minute.  Any minute.  Okay.  You said I was shy, huh?  Yeah, Jim.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Just show Jimmy.  Wow.  Very nice.  That is some wowage.  Beautiful.  Lovely, I might say.  Very nice.  Yeah, I got the guts.  Yeah.  All right.  That was Jimmy, by the way, not me.  I just thought you were shy.  Oh, look at me like I'm the big guy.  Yeah, let it be known.  Me and Ann were cool with it.  We're like, all right, she's a little uncomfortable.  We'll leave her alone.  Well, but I didn't go ballistic and follow her around.  You were very disappointed that she didn't wow her.  Jimmy's the big guy. 
[01:58:00]  Jimmy's the big guy.  Yeah.  That's another one.  There you go.  See, look at the smile on his face.  Everyone's happy.  Look at them.  Jimmy Norton's all happy.  All right.  Thank you.  Look at those cans that are beautiful.  Big as your head.  And we look forward to seeing you in the upcoming season of The Sopranos as one of the Bada-bing  girls.  Bada-bing girls.  Bada-bing-bing.  Very good.  All right.  See you later.  Thank you, Liz.  Anthony, when we get back, we'll talk about that poor couple.  Yes.  The MTV True Life thing, which could lead to another O&A bit that we haven't done in a while.  Oh. 
[01:58:30]  If you know what I'm saying.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the opiate Anthony F.U. line.  Hi, I'm Larry from Buffalo, New York.  I'd like to send a big **** you off to that sell-off piece of ****.  Dominic Hassett for saying that he is and forever will be a Red Wing.  During your eight years in Buffalo, you sucked in the playoffs, dude.  You were either hurt or letting in series-ending goals from the goddamn blue line by Sirius  Casperoidus.  You needed one of the greatest teams ever with the best coach of all time to win you a cup. 
[01:59:00]  My **** grandmother could have won the cup with that team.  Stay the **** out of Buffalo, move back to the Czech Republic, and become a drunk with  the rest of the Euro track.  **** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Brian.  I want to give a big, fat, stinking, sloppy F.U.  to my bosses who've been promising to me a raise and promising to me a raise and promising  to me a raise, and I got nothing.  I keep asking, they keep forgetting.  Yet they always seem to find time to spend their own money on garbage they don't need,  huh?  You know what? 
[01:59:30]  F.U. all and die.  Next message.  To the short, fat, bald George Costanza lookalike wearing the NASA jersey on the T, who intentionally  blocked the train doorway and tried to push me out, even though there was plenty of space  in the car, then told me I have to say excuse me if I want to get past them.  A most sincere, heartfelt **** you, to you, your friends, your family, and any offspring  that may spring from the loins of whatever rancid, smelly, and apparently blind whore will  accept your shriveled, flaccid little ****.  May you die a horribly prolonged cancerous death, the likes of which has never been recorded 
[02:00:00]  in human history.  End of messages.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  It wasn't me, man.  It wasn't me, man.  I didn't smell it.  You caught one or what?  It stinks in here.  The intern said, all right, it smells like ammonia in here right now.  I didn't, I swear.  I smelled it when I walked in, though.  Really?  Somebody was in here, gassed, and walked out. 
[02:00:30]  I didn't guess.  What did the intern say?  She, she, right when she walked in the door, she went, oh, something stinks in here.  Oh, my God.  But I don't smell it back here.  What, Jim?  I just wanted to mention something I got an email on real quick.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, sure.  Let's stop the music and listen to Jim.  What, Jim?  Yeah, I really don't like this additional pressure to my story without a punchline. 
[02:01:00]  No, no, really.  We were rocking, but, you know, it's right here.  But we'll turn it off for a while.  Oh, yeah, let's do music.  If you want to do music, I'll just sit back.  Sorry.  I thought it was talk.  No, it's all about the music.  Jim has something to say.  In England, the politically, this is about political correctness.  Oh, this is actually a good story.  This, this is what, the British people are just awful anyway.  They have changed the name to appease special interest groups.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame is now being called the bell ringer of Notre Dame.  As to not offend any hunchbacks.  People call me O.C.  Who's that?  Hunchbacks. 
[02:01:30]  Hunchbacks.  Who has a hunchback?  Except for, like, 90-year-old women.  And if you do, you deserve to be picked on.  How many hunchbacks are there going, I'm offended.  My God, I saw at least ten today walking to work.  Ten hunchbacks.  First of all, the term has been used in years anyway.  Come on.  Hey, hunchback.  And if they're worried about feelings, why don't they get out of Ireland and stop worrying  about a bunch of people with scoliosis.  Oh, look at your political commentary.  We're making a point.  We're getting so insane that it's going to get to a point where it's just going to go 
[02:02:00]  in the other direction big time.  I hope so.  Oh, without a doubt.  That's what this show's for.  That's what happens because we're not going to deal with this crap for too long.  It has begun sewing back.  Not really, man.  Every major city is like the Republicans?  Yes, it has.  Yes, it has.  But I'm saying we're all going to lose our minds and kind of revolt against the establishment.  Why are we revolting?  I mean, we've got some radio shows like ourselves and stuff.  But in general, yeah, it's all about being very, very PC.  And eventually, the average man and woman, they're going to be like, no. 
[02:02:30]  It's begun changing already.  In the last couple of years.  No, it hasn't.  It really has, dude.  Yes, it has.  It's getting worse, the PC crap.  It has begun.  No, the pendulum has begun to swing back a little bit.  Name one.  What do you mean?  Name an example.  Just the fact that people are electing more conservative people as opposed to quote-unquote  free thinking.  They don't get crapped on.  I'm telling you.  You think your local politician gets something done.  You're ridiculous.  It's the mentality.  I'm telling you.  It's true.  More importantly, look at the round little perky boobies on the Macy.  The contestant 58 now, brand new contestant from Columbus again. 
[02:03:00]  Columbus came to the table today.  I guess they were insulted.  All the abuse they were taking decided to step up.  They're coming back strong.  I haven't even seen 58.  Brand new.  Just up.  And also our second one here from New York.  Hey, Columbus.  Nice.  Nice.  Kind of cute.  Sure.  A lot of compliments the last couple of days.  We haven't trashed too many women.  No.  They're coming to the table now.  All right.  Very nice. 
[02:03:30]  I knew we'd end strong.  We just need about 40 more hot drinks.  And we're only halfway through qualifying.  Right.  Only halfway through.  Are you kidding?  We're not going to be able to qualify next week.  We're taking a few days off.  Yeah.  We'll be here like Monday, Tuesday, maybe Wednesday, and then Thursday in front.  Whatever.  What?  Someone's breathing.  What's that wind I hear?  Eileen.  Yes.  What's wrong?  It's very easy for you people, you pornographers, to sit around and talk about this thing and 
[02:04:00]  that thing when you have money rolling out of your brains.  You must be so rich.  Ropi, you've got a 20 sticking out of your head.  You know, the average, calm and poor person doesn't care about anything you say.  Really?  They're worried about...  You don't even care about your boyfriend having a heart attack.  Why should you care about us?  I don't get a job.  Shut your face, stupid.  And you've got money rolling out of your ears, and that's the only thing you're happy.  Let me hear what you have to say.  That's the only reason you're happy and you're smiling and you're laughing in the studio  is because you know you've got a steady salary, you've got a good job, and you've got a 
[02:04:30]  little niche in this society.  I've got nothing.  I've got no family.  I've got no friends.  I've got no money.  I have skills, and nobody will hire me.  What skills do you have?  You're nothing about pornographers, and I think it's disgusting.  What skills?  You don't believe in being politically correct, so let me speak, too.  What skills do you have?  What skills?  What skills, old lady?  What skills?  I'm not an old lady, fat slob.  You are an old lady. 
[02:05:00]  I'm not a fat slob.  Yes, you are, you single-ignoring bag of meat.  It's not even your show.  Hey, you're both...  What are you doing there anyway?  Hey, watch that language.  You sound like a fat slob.  I'm not a fat slob, you dirty old lady with no...  Oh, dirty old lady mouth.  Dirty old lady mouth.  That's hot.  Yeah, dirty old...  Go down the street.  Nobody's going to look at you.  I pay for it, stupid.  That's the beauty of having all this money.  That's the only way you're going to get anything. 
[02:05:30]  Exactly.  You pay for it.  I can probably give you Jericho and you do it.  You pay for it, and you have the money to pay for it.  You bet I do.  If you don't work, you just sit around.  That's right, and they put it in their mouths, and they go...  Hey, hold on.  Eileen.  Hold on.  Yeah.  We just ran out of dump.  Eileen, you've got to watch out.  Watch your dirty mouth.  Hold on.  That's male harassment.  Right.  Yeah, it is.  Dice, you're right.  The ones you're right. 
[02:06:00]  Where's the non-plural using murderer?  Eileen.  Eileen?  Eileen.  Did she hang up?  Good.  Let her hang up.  I wanted to know what her skills were.  I was just putting her on hold so she got more delay.  I'll tell you one thing, her skills are not.  She's not good at spotting heart attacks.  That's not a skill.  I'm an old bag of meat with a potty mouth.  Why can't I get hired?  She hung up.  Duh, duh, duh. 
[02:06:30]  That's that.  Right, right.  Dirty, cryptkeeper whore.  She calls from a ton of time, but she can call back if she likes.  She's obsessed with the show.  So she can't stop listening.  Yes, she is.  And I love people like her.  There's a bunch of pornographers with money pouring out of their brains.  Out of their ears.  You got money pouring out of your ears.  You know what?  This lady, she likes to show a lot.  She does.  She's a fan.  And you know what?  She's just frustrated when we go down the sex route.  Because she needs to get F. Believe me, if I had her here, I would take her into where 
[02:07:00]  Stinky hangs out.  Club Stinky.  If I took my mule out, pow, she'd be right on it.  You think, yeah?  Guaranteed.  She'd pop her teeth out and bum.  You're pornographers, you're...  I'd put her teeth on a desk and it'd chatter like those little goof teeth you buy.  Like those gag gift teeth.  Get to servicing.  Chop, chop, Methuselah.  The Who will do their tour.  They will?  Yeah, they're going to...  Who are they going to get?  The Who's summer North American tour will continue on despite the death yesterday of founding 
[02:07:30]  bassist John Entwistle.  Wow.  According to a note posted on Guitars, Pete Townsend's official website...  That's carrying.  Pete and Roger have decided that the tour will carry on.  As a tribute.  God, if I see either one of those two on TV going,  the show must go on.  It's what John would have wanted.  Shut up!  I hate that.  You know what this is a story about?  It's John...  Money.  It's what John would have wanted.  Money.  Especially since the tour was starting today, or supposed to start. 
[02:08:00]  You know how much money has been poured into this already?  You can't just pull out.  You can't just leave.  There are commitments that are made.  Money has already been spent on a stage, on venues.  You can't then just pull out.  You've got to pay for this stuff.  Someone's going to take a bath.  Bass player Pino Palladino has been drafted in for the shows.  Hey, Pino Palladino!  I played him back in 82 in a movie.  Pino Palladino. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, Dice, maybe you can play bass for the...  I could do that.  I know you like the drums, and I know you like your rock and roll.  It's all rhythm.  I got it.  Rhythm on the drums, the bass, banging my wife.  Ow!  Pino Palladino?  Oh!  Palladino.  Oh, where did he come from?  Someone will know who he is.  I don't.  The Las Vegas and Urban Shows will be rescheduled for new dates, Anthony.  Man.  You know, there's already people on the web and stuff. 
[02:09:00]  I guarantee there will be an official website soon.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out what band will run out of members first.  Oh, that's a good bet.  I'm not kidding.  It's already kind of out there.  Like, will the Ramones run out of members before the Who or the Beatles?  When every member of the band is dead.  Right.  Beatles down to two.  Wow, let me think.  Beatles are at two.  The Ramones, the Who's down to two.  Who's at two.  Zeppelin's down to three.  How did Entry Russell die?  They're saying heart attack. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Think he had an uncaring, tired girlfriend that just dozed off while his life was ebbing away on a tiled floor?  I heard a bass guitar being played, and I didn't know.  It stopped, and I went to sleep.  Boy, you should live with guilt every day of the rest of your awful old life.  So if I said, John, are you okay?  And he just had foam gurgling out of his mouth, so I needed a nap.  You're a pornographer.  Pornographers.  Shut up.  If you would have just gotten out of bed, your partner would still be here. 
[02:10:00]  Oh.  A sleepy head.  She's a real sleepy head.  It really is more important to get back to that dream of being young and firm, wasn't it?  Creep.  And the main...  Oh, yeah, okay, maybe.  And the mainstream media are making a big deal that President Bush will undergo a colon check Saturday  that will require him to be sedated, Anthony.  The colonoscopy, right?  They're giving him the pipe.  Oh, we can't play the pipe anymore. 
[02:10:30]  We can't.  Jump out of that thing like crazy.  Are you kidding me?  We love the pipe song.  Let's go get the pipe.  Why can't you play that anymore?  Oh, please.  We've got to clean it up.  We've got to find out what were the...  Hey, FCC is really on the ball.  The powers of the presidency will be briefly transferred to Vice President Dick Cheney.  I hope Eileen isn't Dick Cheney's girlfriend with his problems.  You know, you need to carry one.  Isn't Dick Cheney already running the country?  Oh, my. 
[02:11:00]  You know, I love comics that are coming off going, boy, Bush is stupid.  Boy, you comics, you effing hacks.  Can somebody say something different?  God almighty, these stupid pseudo-intellectuals act.  Every comic.  Well, Bush is stupid.  Shut up, liberal dope.  He's not stupid.  Hey, a year ago, he couldn't even spell Afghanistan.  Good gosh.  Come on, audience. 
[02:11:30]  Give me the cheap slut applause.  Yeah, boy.  He's challenging the president.  Every one of you mother effers.  God almighty.  Predictable.  So I get it.  He's stupid and slow, right?  Yeah, what else is new?  Hey, what's wrong with getting a little BJ if you're Clinton?  Don't you want your president to be happy?  Every one of them.  It's about time he takes something in the A. 
[02:12:00]  He's been giving it to us for a couple of years now.  You think Bush can even find Afghanistan on a map?  Oh, my stars.  More bright, liberally enlightened comics.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Pino Palladino, studio bass player. 
[02:12:30]  Played in the 80s with Don Henley.  Oof.  Records, uh, and recently played with Richard Ashcroft from The Verve.  All right.  There you go.  Pino Palladino.  Good gig for him.  Good for you, then.  Good for you, then.  I could have played.  Ever since I was a young boy, I played something with the balls.  Talking about my gigi-gigi-gigi generation.  People try to put me down. 
[02:13:00]  Gigi-gigi generation.  I won't get fooled again.  No.  I'm sorry.  It's going to be 20,000 songs.  It won't even queue up.  Yeah, look, I'm playing the bass.  Hey, people try to put me down.  Talking about my generation.  Just because my pants are down.  Oh.  Talking about my generation.  They seem awful, I don't know.  Gold. 
[02:13:30]  Talking about my generation.  I hope I don't die before I get old.  Too late.  Oh.  My generation.  My generation's heavy.  Talking about my generation.  All right, you're so handsome, play or not.  Talking about my generation.  Don't try to hit me with things that are gay.  Talking about my generation.  Talking about my generation.  I'm trying to call.  the pigs.  Yeah.  Say, same.  Talking about Master.  I can't say that.  Oh. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Somealtene, Greg.  Sure.  I played him in the 80s.  It was a movie about banging.  See, I gotta play this one slow  It's like, uh, it's almost a ballad at the beginning  Then it starts rocking  Bring it down a little bit  Okay, here I go  All right  Nice windmill, nice 
[02:14:30]  Since I was a young dice, I played with the balls  Yeah, I must have played with them all  No  That deaf-dumming blanket is a stupid bastard who should be shot  At least he ain't a midget  He's staying like a statue 
[02:15:00]  He must be retarded  He's feeling the bumpers  He's playing clip, but he's an idiot  That deaf-dumming blanket  I could bend over and bang him  And he can't identify me  Cause she's retarded  I got my own thing to the Who  But now it's mine  If you can go on tour with the Who, you gotta learn the words to the song  No, they learn me  I like this one 
[02:15:30]  It's a long intro, bro  It certainly is  Yeah, huh?  Let's go get a sandwich  Then we'll start the bit in three minutes  All right, I forget  Cut our losses  Yeah  Oh, Ed's got a nice presidential joke for us  All right  Presidential humor  Go ahead, Ed  Hey, fellas  Since he's getting a call to ask me  Maybe we'll find his head out there  Oh, but I tell you, Buck. 
[02:16:00]  Hey, mercy me.  That's actually a good joke.  That is good.  That's actually a funny, that'll be a funny line.  I will bet money that joke is on Letterman or Leno tonight.  That's like the obvious right there, right?  That's the obvious one, yep.  You know what I'm saying?  It was just the fact that every comic takes the exact same angle on Bush being stupid  to get a cheap slut applause from a bunch of dumbbells in the audience, and it's aggravating.  They'll always applaud that.  But it's not, it's like, God, he's not stupid, all right? 
[02:16:30]  He's not a great speaker, but he's not stupid enough already.  All right, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, it's 6 o'clock.  I think it's time for the Jim Norton musical rant.  No, no, today we all love Black Sabbath, and we all admit they're the greatest band ever.  Thank you, Ozzy is God.  I forgot we flip-flopped.  I wouldn't want to bash the Who anyway to get lost in.  Come on, a guy died?  Ozzy is God.  That's also very true, but there's nothing to do with that. 
[02:17:00]  All right, I got one for you, Dice.  Oh, the magic buzz.  I don't know this one too well.  The magic buzz.  Okay.  Michael, what's going on?  Michael.  Yeah.  How you doing?  I was watching MTV's True Life, I Am Gay. 
[02:17:30]  I'm coming out or whatever?  Yeah.  Was that on already?  Yeah, it was on last night at 10.  It was the True Life.  You know those True Life?  Yeah, no, I understand.  I think it's what, it's like five kids that want to tell their parents that they're gay, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the worst show I have ever seen in my life.  What was really bad about it?  That MTV wants to, you know, want to express these kids' feelings to their parents. 
[02:18:00]  So their parents react so badly.  You have a really weird accent.  You speak weird.  I don't, I can't put my finger on it.  MTV and really.  Michael, it sounds like you might want to come out soon.  Uh, no, not really.  He doesn't sound gay.  No.  There's something weird about his speech pattern.  Yes.  Oh, thanks.  Well, no, what's wrong with your voice, bro?  Nothing. 
[02:18:30]  Well, you might be very articulate.  Yeah, very true.  He has great diction.  Where are you from, sir?  Uh, Stuy Austin.  How old are you?  20.  You're one of these, you were one of those brainy kids, right?  Uh, sort of.  That's good.  How big are you down there?  Now, you know what?  Let's go with it.  So what was the problem with the show?  The problem with the show is...  He's starting to change his voice.  He is.  Michael, stop.  Stop with the show.  Oh, Michael, it's all good.  We're just messing with you.  Go ahead.  Talk like you talk.  Um, what was wrong with the show was, like, these kids were just, like, uh, just... 
[02:19:00]  Inarticulate, fool.  He's just staying.  He's concentrating to try to change his voice that he's not articulate.  Yeah, he's so self-conscious of the way he's speaking now that he can't speak.  Michael, we like your voice.  Go.  Yeah.  All right.  Like, these kids were just, uh, acting weird to their parents.  Like, they can't say it.  Like, oh, um, I gotta tell you, uh, Dad, uh... 
[02:19:30]  Well, I didn't imagine that.  It's not easy to just tell your parents you're gay.  Hey, Dad, you're gonna be stammering all over the place.  Remember all those catches we were having in the yard?  I was thinking of drinking out of Teddy's Mule.  Oh, God, Norton.  Well, you see what I'm saying there, Angel Face?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  Yeah.  Bye.  You sounded strained, yet perfectly, uh, spoken.  Jason, what's going on?  Yo, ONA.  Hey. 
[02:20:00]  Uh, my friend, my friend was actually, actually was my ex-friend.  He was on that show last night.  And, uh, for the whole time, all through high school, like, he played it out like he was straight.  But, uh, actually, when I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, he actually received a Hummer from her.  A Hummer from her?  Really, man?  Yep.  Yes, sir.  All right.  Well, thanks, bro.  What a bummer.  Yo, you know what he said afterwards?  Oh, that couldn't have been dumber? 
[02:20:30]  I'll see you next summer.  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Almost like the boss from yesterday is the same boss as the boss today.  You hear?  I hear me.  Oh, no.  Huh?  Let me get into the silly zone.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Tommy, can you hear me?  I hear ya.  Can you feel me near you?  Tommy, can you see me?  Oh!  Hey, hey, hey.  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy, you stupid ass.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy, can you hear me?  You hear me?  I hear ya.  Can you feel me near you?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy, can you see me? 
[02:21:30]  Open your eyes, jackass.  Tommy.  Tommy.  I hear you.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Can you hear me?  Can you feel me near you?  Hey, Tommy.  Can you see me?  Tommy, Tommy.  Tommy, Tommy.  Can I help you cheer you?  Oh!  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy. 
[02:22:00]  Tommy.  Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! He's already in!  That's so stupid it's funny. You guys are right, too. That's better than Sada. Oh, stop it.  We're not even going there. No way. I'm too tired. All right, listen, a few things. Yes, a guy brings up a good one on line four. Whoopi Goldberg had some news last night for everybody. Oh! And then we've got to talk about these two lovers that were found dead with their car running. A little Asian couple, I think, from the names. And as we go to break, Anthony, an old bit. What? Yeah, I know, I know. That's a break. We've got to break, man. 
[02:22:30]  Look at Rick, I'm so excited. That coming out show on MTV. Yeah. You know, it's something, it reminds us of a bit we do from time to time where we break the news for people. Hi, mom, I'm gay. 
[02:23:00]  Well, we've got the hi, mom. Yeah, I'm gay. But, I mean, I'm thinking just in general. Yep. You know, we do it from time to time. If you've got something you want to tell someone but you don't have the balls to do it, we'll do it for you. We do a really good job. So let us know. We call up the person and we help you out. Yeah, we'll bail you out. Okay? That's what we're here for. You're here. But as we go to break, hi, mom, I'm gay. Fine. Relating to the MTV thing, sort of. 
[02:23:30]  No more who? No more who? Dude, I had a look, though. It looked like you might have something for the show. I had to look. I had to look, though. You understand, right? Stop ignoring me.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play, hi, mom, I'm gay? Absolutely. Now, I hear you're 35 years old. Yeah. Never been married. Ever. Are you gay?  No rope swallowing. All right, Bob, let's give it a shot. All right. You've got to try to convince her, man. All right, I'll be right back. Let's give your mom a call, man. 
[02:24:00]  Hello? Mom, can you hear me, darling? Yeah. It's Bobby. Bobby? Yeah. Where are you? I'm at work. Yeah, well, you sound awful funny. Yeah, I know. All right. Hey, mom, you sitting down? Why? I've got to tell you something. What?  Uh, don't get nervous. That's what might be meaning to tell you. I was going to tell you when you called earlier today. Yeah? I'm gay. Oh, you're full of s***. I'm a twinkie. I swear it. Bobby, will you stop it? You know, I have enough aggravation. What? How come you never believe me? Because I don't believe you. Why? Well, you just had a child, Bobby. Yeah. That was to throw you off. Yeah. Okay. You know, I wanted to tell you that. I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but... 
[02:24:30]  Bobby. What? Are you trying to be funny? I'm not. I had to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right. I've known it ever since I was a kid. Bobby, are you with Donna? Not at the moment. Not at the moment. All right. With Lenny. Okay. You can tell your father that. I'm not even going to bring it up. All right. You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people. So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden? Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know? 
[02:25:00]  Not hate. I think, you know, good God. You still love me? Of course I love you. You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh? Bobby, what the hell are you doing? Drinking? No. No. Yeah. All right. All right. Okay. I'm working. Your father's out to lunch. Have you told Gene this? 
[02:25:30]  No. No. I was going to spring it on him tonight. Yeah. That's nice. Yeah. You do that. Stand a long distance away, will you? I will. Out of arm's reach. Bobby, don't give me that baloney, please. You break my heart when you do things like this. I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you. Yeah. That'd be nice. All right. All right. I love you. See you later. I love you, too. Okay. 
[02:26:00]  Holy Jesus. Dude. I got to get back to her quick, man. She's going to put a knife in her wrist. You better do that. Hey, Bob. Yeah. Bob, I'm gay. I'm gay. This guy sounds like the manliest dude around. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob. I'm gay. That'll explain the rough throat. Yeah. I'm going to tweak you, Bob. That's how I got the throat this bad, Bob. 
[02:26:30]  I've been swallowing too many ropes. Hey, Bob. Bob. You sit down, Bob. Oh, man. Hold on. You want to call your mom back and then call us? Yeah. I've got to get her head out of the oven. All right. We'll recognize her head out of the oven. We'll recognize your voice. Call back, all right? All right. Thanks. All right, man. Bye.  We'll see you next time. Bye. 
[02:27:00]  Chris, what's going on, bro? Hey, man. Yo, I just moved out here to L.A. Yeah. When are you guys getting out here, man?  Yeah. I am dying, dude. I'll tell you flat out. We're just not good enough for L.A. That must be it. 
[02:27:30]  Dude, it's ridiculous. We could only wish we had the talent to be heard in L.A. I don't know. There's no reason you shouldn't be out here.  I don't know what it is. We've tried really hard. Our agent is on it like you wouldn't believe it.  He knows that is priority numero uno. That's just not happening. At this point, we'd give away the show. We don't care. We just want to be on in L.A., but they've got some incredible talent out there. We can't compete, Anthony.  That's what it is. I don't know what it is.  I know. Sometimes we've just got to step aside and realize we're not good enough for a city and just take it. 
[02:28:00]  Who are we to think that we could be on in L.A.? See, if I didn't stammer and stutter all the time, maybe they would appreciate me in L.A.  Maybe that. I am awful. Someday, bro. All right, Chris. All right, man. Thanks a lot, guys.  The word's out there. Why does Dice want to sing another Who song?  Oh, come on. Well, I guess he's taking over.  You hear? I can hear me. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, this is a fun song.  Mama's got a squeeze, but she wears on a chest.  When Daddy comes home, he don't get no rest.  Because she's f***ing it all night.  All night long.  And the f***ing's all right.  As he's f***ing it.  No, Daddy don't sleep at night.  Because she's banging it.  Oh! 
[02:29:00]  The kids don't sleep.  The dog can't eat.  There's no escaping the music  in the whole f***ing street.  He's f***ing it all night.  And the music's all right.  Oh!  Mama's got a big f***ing  Daddy never sleeps at night.  Why?  Why don't he sleep?  Because she's f***ing that big fat.  Loud and in and out. 
[02:29:30]  And he's f***ing it all night long.  And he sprays banana juice.  And it's all right.  Mama's got a f***ing f***ing daddy.  He's f***ing it all night.  Ow!  It goes in and out.  And it all night long.  With that horse.  Come on and f***ing me.  Come on and f*** me in the f***ing. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, hey.  I'll flip her over.  I don't care.  I hope.  Mama's got a stinky f***ing.  Never sleeps at night.  It goes in and out  until I make a mess.  Play the banjo, you retard.  Play the f***ing banjo, you f***ing.  Fuck it.  Oh!  Look, I'm dancing.  I'm doing line dancing. 
[02:30:30]  I'm boot scooting.  She goes in and out.  And in and out.  My big fat s*** goes in and out of this mess.  I'm sweating all night.  And the s*** ain't tight no more.  Mama's got a speech box  and it never sleeps at night.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:31:00]  Fabulous.  Thank you, Dice.  Oh, he's got more?  Ain't this a long intro, too?  Yeah, so Whoopi Goldberg  admitted that she used to play  on both sides of the street  when she was younger.  Oh, yeah?  There you go.  Even at the time where  when she was doing Ted Danson?  Way before that, I guess.  Oh, before that.  All right.  That's still like a lady  every once in a while.  Tidbit.  There you go. 
[02:31:30]  That's all you need to hear.  It was nice of a zero  to come out and say that.  Oh, yeah.  And also, uh,  two young lovers  who stole away  for an afternoon trip  in an air-conditioned car  were found dead by relatives  inside a Queen's garage  because the car  was still running.  Oh, you idiots.  You should have known.  By the way,  is anyone enjoying this intro?  It's great.  Yeah, man.  How is it?  You don't like this? 
[02:32:00]  No.  The ten-second gift  and four-minute smoke.  Big, nice, long,  cool intro.  Out here in the fields,  a man has to fight  for his meals.  You hear me?  I hear me.  I get my  f***ing two h***s.  See?  I don't need to fight.  You hear?  The proof I'm right. 
[02:32:30]  Right, Kenny?  Right, handsome.  I don't need to be forgiven.  I don't care.  When men were oysters,  they fought for their meals  back like the days  when they fought tigers  for the meat  in the jungle.  You hear?  I hear me.  It's Teenage Wasteland.  This song is conducive  to the nice man.  It was still good. 
[02:33:00]  Yo.  I don't like that.  Hey, maybe you can play  You Better, You Better, You Better.  Shut up.  We're not talking about music today.

[02:37:00]  listening on tape delay  so I just heard Anthony  talking to you about  banging the Nerf ball  I hate to admit this  but when I was 12  I took a standard size  old furry teddy bear  cut a hole  where you should cut the hole  oh  I think we can say that right?  yes  yeah  filled it with  an economy sized jar  of grape jelly  grape jelly?  because I couldn't find  any Vaseline  a jelly bear  in your foot locker  is pre-stallity  allowed in the barracks  they're paying for it

[02:38:30]  sell the car  to someone  to make some money  and the next thing you know  old Jed's a millionaire  wrong  the feds know  that the guy's lying  the feds know  that I told the truth  that I was ready  to give him the car  I don't want the car  I've already used the car  enough  I've been in New York  that's what he's involved  with the feds  I'm kidding you  that I've had like  federal agents  and like weirdos  and freaks  and cops in Philly  and cops here  everybody in my face  but they all know  that I told the truth  I never did anything wrong  except  I guess I used bad judgment 
[02:39:00]  on leaving the car  in Philly  with an idiot  he thought he'd sell the car  which is owned by  as you know  dang  so I got in all kinds  of trouble  but not really  because I told the truth  even my ex-wife  knew I told the truth  and that was good  because she hates me too  so Pharrell  basically you never gave  this car back  and you told somebody  that the car  is hiding somewhere  in Philly right?  well actually  I told them  where the car was  and then when I finally  got over the guy  that had it  he said that  the car was gone  he had sold it  for money  and you can't do that  he had no title 
[02:39:30]  no lien  and it got ugly  everybody was swearing  and cussing  and fighting  and threatening  he said I was dead  about a thousand times  and he's five foot tall  and I said  I'm sure you're not  going to do it to me  so come on up  little man  I'll stick my thumb  in your eye  and it got vicious  and everybody was  screaming and yelling  and fighting  and lawyers  and everyone else  it was crazy  I didn't do anything wrong  other than  I guess  take a few car payments  but then again  you know  I ride those  OP scooters  and I'm like  I'm two
