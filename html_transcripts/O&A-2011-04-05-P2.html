<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a studio party featuring Bob Kelly and Jason Ellis. A significant portion of the early show involved a staged and graphically described "rape" bit where Jason Ellis pretended to rape Sam Roberts, timed at 38 seconds.  This involved a physical struggle and was presented for comedic effect.  The hosts briefly alluded to similar staged "rape" scenarios involving Bob Kelly and Roland.

Later in the broadcast, a major conflict erupted between Opie and Jesse Ventura.  Ventura became enraged, accusing Opie of misrepresenting his views on the Constitution. The argument escalated into a personal confrontation, culminating in Ventura's angry departure from the studio.  The entire altercation was reportedly recorded on video, and the hosts and others extensively discussed and analyzed Venturaâ€™s reaction and the events leading up to the outburst.

The show then shifted to discussing future plans. These included a possible re-enactment of a previous armpit waxing bit with E-Rock, and a "Most Annoying Sounds" segment featuring a listener-submitted audio clip containing numerous racial and homophobic slurs, followed by commentary from Jim Norton.  The hosts also addressed the impending absences of both Anthony and potentially Opie from future broadcasts. The show concluded with mentions of upcoming guests, including Vera Farmiga and Ron Bennington.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus, Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After ONA Live, and there's a party in the studio.  Bob Kelly's with us.  Opie, the mics are on.  Jason Ellis.  All the mics are still on. We're live.  You're still on the radio.  Good.  Why can't you just get one of those Madonna mics and strap it to my fucking face?  I'll keep it going. We should fuck him. 
[00:00:30]  Who?  We should fuck who?  Sam.  Yeah, let's fuck him all.  You know what I do?  Here's one for you.  There's a bit.  How long do you think it would take for you to rape him?  I think...  Because I do it all the time.  Well, like on a deserted island?  No, I will get you on the ground, get your pants down.  No, not long.  I'm not going to put my penis in your hole, but I'm going to get your pants down.  You have to try and find me.  I'm going to get my video camera out.  You have to try and find me and stop me from me getting your pants down,  and then I'm going to get you on the ground and pump you once.  One pump, then you call time.  Jason, I know we're doing radio, but you've got to set up for my fucking video channel, man. 
[00:01:00]  Right, welcome to Opie's video channel.  Okay.  I don't like this idea.  Shut up, Sam.  It's not about you.  It's my show.  Shut up.  I'm not even showing you yet.  Sam, your show is shit.  Well, it hasn't even started yet.  Well, now it's good.  It's about to go shit when we leave after I've raped your fucking ass.  That might not happen.  I say that I can do it in under one minute.  So what are you going to do?  No strikes, by the way.  No striking.  Okay, no striking.  This is a bit Jason Ellis is going to see how long it takes to get Sam into a position 
[00:01:30]  where he would actually be raped.  But you're not going to actually rape him, because that would be gay, right?  No, it's a simulating bit.  Sam, game on?  No.  You don't want to do it right now?  I would rather not.  Come over here.  No, no, no, no.  You have to come here.  I mean, you have to break through my fortress.  There's no room to rape you there.  Come over here.  Listen to the fucking Opie, Matt, and stop me from raping you.  Listen to your boss.  Do you have to rape him on the Opie, Matt?  Yeah, I don't think that's right.  Yes, I do have to.  I think going to get him is more of a rape.  You have to go. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Because rape victims don't come to you.  Exactly.  I just want everyone to know Sam agreed to this.  No, I didn't.  We started the poll.  But I guess that's what makes it rape.  I think there's a lot of listeners that are going to love this fucking thing.  Oh, no.  I thought I could use a chair.  We're standing next to each other.  Look, move these existing.  You're going to work.  All right.  Jason Ellis is working his way over to Sam.  You should probably get it.  He's going to go down on the ground.  All right.  I'll be over there.  As soon as he gets on the ground.  You got stuff in the way, though.  No, I'll make it over there.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  I love how Jason is taking his time knowing that he's definitely going to get this done. 
[00:02:30]  I like that Sam is actually just patiently waiting to be raped.  Well, what am I going to do?  You're going to try.  Fight?  Prevent me from raping you.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  You ready?  Yeah.  Go.  Bobby, you talk.  All right.  Here we go.  He's got Sam down.  Sam's fighting back.  He's got him in a headlock.  Up.  But here he goes.  This is the end right here.  Double.  He's got a double leg takedown. 
[00:03:00]  Oops.  Oh, shit.  They're out of view.  They're out of camera view.  No, I got mine.  I got mine.  You got it?  You got it?  This is looking way too real.  All right.  Sam is still fighting.  He got it.  He fucked him.  He pumped him.  How many pumps?  How many pumps?  How long?  How long?  How long?  But did it again?  That was actually two minutes.  Yeah, I did it.  No, no.  You said it under a minute.  No, no.  It was actually only 38 seconds.  38 seconds.  I can't rape anyone under a minute.  You can quote me on that shit. 
[00:03:30]  I got it.  Was I a good contender?  That's way better than playing some old O.P. and Anthony collection.  Yeah, but did I do better than people expected?  No.  It was 38 seconds.  For a minute, you said I was fighting him off.  For a minute.  Can I just say something?  For a second.  Not to actually pressure you or to compete with you, but I've raped him in under 20 seconds.  That's hilarious.  I was kind of impressed.  But he didn't fight me as much as he fought you.  Well, you did it romantically.  He was more like...  I fought back as well as he did.  Thank you.  He did get holding under the table.  You did all right.  He blew it because that actually helped me get your pants off. 
[00:04:00]  Was that what you need?  Oh, because my arms were up.  The best part is fat people will hold their stomach over their belt buckle so I can't get  my hand in there to get their pants down.  I gotta go.  Where you going, Bob?  You want to rape Bob next?  Hey, Bobby!  Bobby!  Hey!  And Roland got out of here quick, too.  You see how quick...  All the fat guys just want to rape.  You mentioned raping fat people.  Bob and Roland leave.  10 seconds maximum for both of them.  E-Rock is just happy he's in the other room right now.  I'll rape the shit out of E-Rock.  No, E-Rock would have a heart attack.  He's not in shape to fight off a rape. 
[00:04:30]  Kenny, where were you?  I just got raped.  Aren't you security?  What happened?  Nothing.  Kenny...  I'm not raping this guy.  Kenny's just getting Jimmy's stuff.  All right, Sam.  Well, thanks for being here, Ellis and Opie.  No problem.  Fuck you, Sam.  Oh, man.  Literally.  Whenever I want to.  Yeah, but it'll take you at least 38 seconds.  That's a twisted bit you got going there.  Thank you.  You know, I actually have my friend Raw Dog, my co-host.  I have him on, and sometimes I ask guests if they would like to attempt to rape him. 
[00:05:00]  And we make bets on how long it will take to rape him.  He'll put on it.  For a little guy, he will put on a fucking struggle.  What's the quickest you ever did?  I think I raped somebody in...  I raped him in under 20 seconds.  Oh, look at that.  So, I mean, I did 38.  I did, like, double.  I'm going to check the tape.  That.  I'll give you an official count later.  You had a wall to hold on.  If it's just a clear area...  Yeah, it's a little more difficult.  You're done.  Plus, you had to be a little careful as to not smash my head against everything.  Does it make you feel weird knowing that I can put my penis in your ass whenever  I want?  No, I assume...  Because I didn't... 
[00:05:30]  You notice how I started to get on your neck a little bit?  Yeah.  If I wanted to, I could have just...  No, I mean...  I could have got it in quicker.  Before the game, as somebody like me assumes, if this person wanted to, he could rape me.  Like, I knew that going in.  Yeah.  So, it doesn't make me...  I still feel the same way about you.  What about just walking the streets knowing men can rape you?  Does that feel weird?  I mean, no, it doesn't feel weird because I hope that most wouldn't.  But I prefer...  They could, though.  They could.  I think we all know that already.  Yeah.  You see guys out there that...  There is somebody that could rape everyone out there that could rape you. 
[00:06:00]  You know that.  No.  Yes, I think there is.  No, there isn't.  Yeah, there is.  I believe there is.  Yeah, there is.  Maybe from behind, jumping me in a cheap shot.  But you don't think face-to-face?  Face-to-face is that Brock Lesnar could not rape me.  Oh, my God.  We've got to get Brock Lesnar back in here to play this game.  Good.  Do it.  Good.  I'm ready.  That's the game you've got to play.  You should try to...  I'll switch his ass off.  What are the odds that you'll try to rape Jesse Ventura today when he's on your show?  Is he on my show today, dude?  I'm just trying to kick back.  I don't want to talk to that guy.  So, do the rape game. 
[00:06:30]  Way too intense, Rich.  I should say that, huh?  All right.  Welcome to the show.  I think I can rape you in two minutes.  How do you feel about that?  Fucking let's protest that shit.  Yeah.  He's already...  He's a big man.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alice.  I'll do a show later this week, hopefully.  Yeah.  Thank you, Opie.  We'll see how his show is run.  Sam, we're going to rape Opie.  I'm Jason.  You know what?  Now I'm not doing his show.  Yeah.  Stay tuned to Jason Alice this week.  He'll be raping Opie.  I think we're going to play an Otto and George bit in a little bit because it'll feel bad.  An Otto and George? 
[00:07:00]  Otto and George.  Otto.  Otto.  George?  Otto.  Who's that?  What is it?  Otto?  Otto and George?  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto?  Otto and George.  A-U-T-O.  Is that like...  I don't have my headphones on, Iraq.  I have no interest in what you have to say.  I mean, what difference does it make?  Is that like, instead of saying conquering the other day, you said cockering?  I didn't say cock-ring.  I said conquering.  You said I was cockering Facebook.  I said conquering Facebook.  You said I was cockering-ing Facebook. 
[00:07:30]  I don't like this...  And now you want to play a clip from Otto and George.  No, I'm going to play a clip from Otto and George.  That's his name.  It's not Otto.  I can't...  I feel bad that Otto wasn't around, so...  It's Otto!  But before we do that, we're going to play the Jesse Ventura thing that we talked about  today.  What was that?  Jesse Ventura walking out of the show.  Oh, you're going to play that again?  Yeah, we're going to play it.  I mean, it's an abridged version, because I don't trust the attention span of these listeners.  I want them to come back to stay tuned after Opie and Anthony Live.  I guess it's relevant. 
[00:08:00]  Relevant?  I mean, you talked about it for an hour and a half today.  Oh, we did?  Yeah.  You should have made it look fine.  What happened to Otto?  He went to do his interview with Steve Sterniolo.  He panicked, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  I feel bad now.  Did Otto panic today?  Because now it's not Otto anymore.  It's Otto.  That's his name, Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  All right.  Roll it.  You all right?  Yeah, you don't fucking care.  It's all right.  Wow, you know what he just said?  I didn't hear.  He said, yeah, you don't fucking care.  It's all right.  I hear that.  Ooh, girlfriend. 
[00:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I'll see you later.  All right.  Have a wonderful day, Opie.  What day are you doing Jason Ellis?  Do you know?  Well, now that I find out he rapes people, never.  Okay, so you don't want to play the rape game?  It's not that bad.  No, because how do I prevent him from raping me now?  Well, you're not going to, but he's only going to do two pumps at most.  He did two pumps on you?  Two pumps.  He said he would only do one, but he did two.  I might be able to handle two pumps.  It's not that big of a deal.  No!  I'll take the hit.  E-Rock said he'll take the hit.  He's just gay.  No. 
[00:09:00]  He's just attracted to E-Rock.  I mean, Ellis.  Hold on.  I do care.  Hold on a bit.  E.  Yeah.  Are we bringing that bit to Jason Ellis?  I haven't found anybody for me.  Shit.  What's the bit?  Well, it doesn't matter if he knows.  I want to reenact the bit where we fucking waxed E-Rock's armpit hair.  Remember the pain he was in in that bathroom at K-Rock?  Yeah, we did it at K-Rock.  But I want to redo it for Jason Ellis because he always brings a bit to our show, so I feel  like we've got to go old school and give him something. 
[00:09:30]  So I said to E-Rock, can we find that person?  And I even said that not only would you do it, I would do it.  You wouldn't do it on your show?  I would do it.  Oh.  I feel like I've got to give him a bit.  Why don't you just get some...  We need someone that could wax armpit hair.  I can do it.  With the ripping.  Just get some hot wax.  I'll do it.  Why can't we get the girl that did it originally?  She was kind of cool.  That's a Nagel question.  Now, that was a Steve thing who has responded back to that email.  It was Steve.  Well, Steve is lucky to be alive.  We'll explain that tomorrow. 
[00:10:00]  What a tease.  A little tease for tomorrow's show.  Our old producer, if he wasn't let go by this company, he might not be with us today.  And that is the God's honest truth.  We'll explain tomorrow.  If we're going to do the fuck shit, how do they get a hold of you?  Worst of at SiriusXM.com.  All right.  Because we seriously want a woman to come in and do the wax thing with her armpits.  Yeah, somebody who does it for a living.  For the Jason Ellis Show.  I think either tomorrow or Thursday.  By the way, it's a complete mess over here since the attempted rape happened.  Yeah, I saw that.  That's too painful, though.  What?  The waxing? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I wouldn't do it.  Later, Otto and George.  Well, we're not going to do Otto and George just yet.  We were just talking about Jesse Ventura.  He's going to be on Alice's show.  He won't do our show.  So, and to those of you...  You're still talking to me or the audience?  No, I'm talking to the audience now.  I was actually talking to the audience the whole time they were listening to me talk to you.  You were talking through me?  Yeah, I always talk to the audience.  Those are the people I'm communicating with, first and foremost.  Then why was I here?  Just as another voice in the room.  That's all it is.  You're getting a little too big for your britches.  This is my hour. 
[00:11:00]  You said it.  Remember you were on here and you said this is my show?  You're getting a little too big for your britches.  I just got raped.  I don't think I'm getting that big.  No, the real raping is going to happen after the mics go off.  Oh, no.  Iraq, you got me in trouble.  Wait until he finds out that we have guest booked for 10 o'clock.  No reason to bring that up.  Let's play the reason Jesse Ventura won't do the Opie and Anthony show right here on  After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  It troubles me because...  I don't like the perverse use of the Constitution.  We're out in the middle in the United States and you're asked to produce your citizenship 
[00:11:30]  when you've already done it at the border.  And our country has never made us have to produce any type of thing like that just to  freely travel about the country.  Where are your papers?  Do you have to produce your...  Where are your papers?  Can you leave Minnesota into South Dakota?  And I foresee in the future they're going to have...  State to state, you think?  State to state where you're going to have to produce paperwork to go from one state to  the next.  It's called Easy Pass.  And that's called taking away your freedoms in light of keeping us safe. 
[00:12:00]  Slippery...  That's what you'd say to the police doing our police work.  Let's keep us safe.  That's what you'd say about the police doing our police work.  Don't put word on it in police work.  That in police work, that's immigration.  But if it wasn't a cop...  Say the cop had done it.  No, no, no.  It ain't a cop.  You said it's all police work to stop questioning people in a mosque.  You'd say, oh, that's racist.  A cop can pull you over.  Don't put words in my mouth, please.  I'm lying.  You've done it to me.  You did it to me.  You said I don't believe in the Constitution.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jess. 
[00:12:30]  Governor.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  There's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule, asshole.  You're using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  And thanks for your service to our country.  You're welcome.  Thanks for touching me with your fucking stupid riffraff fucking Rocky Horror hairdo.  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a shit.  You want to beat me up?  Go ahead.  I'm not going to fight a guy like you. 
[00:13:00]  That means nothing to me.  I know.  I argued with you.  You put words in my mouth and you didn't like when I did it to you.  You put words in my mouth saying I didn't believe in the Constitution and that's bullshit.  It's not true.  I don't agree with abusing it.  Thank you for your service.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're a bigger patriot than me.  Godspeed.  Fuck out of here.  Wow.  What happened?  He's a fucking baby. 
[00:13:30]  What happened?  That ended on a fucking baby.  Who gives a shit?  A big fucking guy that doesn't like the little guy yelling.  You scared him, Jimmy.  No, here's what that is.  He wanted to knock my fucking block off, but he knows that he shouldn't or he can't because  of the law or all this stuff.  Fuck you.  I don't care because I fucking hate that shit.  What happened, Sam?  I really do.  Don't fight.  I bow to you.  I would never.  So do I.  I would never. 
[00:14:00]  I saw the look Jesse was giving you.  I don't care.  I would never try to challenge a guy like that physically and I don't posture that way.  He would murder me.  You're like fucking Spider.  You were just like Spider.  I want to talk to your money.  I would never talk tough guy talk.  I was arguing an ideological point.  I would never get in Jesse Ventura's face and think I'm going to outman him.  That was not my point.  I've never done that.  Don't fucking tough guy me.  I hate that.  I don't care how strong he is.  I hate that.  You are.  That drives me nuts, man.  That's my fucking pet peeve. 
[00:14:30]  I hate it.  Suicide by wrestler was what he was trying.  Holy shit.  It's not a tough guy thing.  The guy would.  It's not about that.  I'm not going to fight Jesse Ventura.  I just I can't be bullied.  It makes me fuck.  Fuck you.  I hate it.  How do you feel when he tapped your shoulder?  Annoyed.  Not intimidated.  Annoyed.  Annoyed.  Thank you for your service.  He didn't do it hard.  It wasn't a threatening.  But it was.  Don't try to alpha mail me, stupid.  Danny's just put up a picture of the Crypt Keeper. 
[00:15:00]  Danny's real brave.  Jimmy's the only one that opened his mouth like a man.  I fucking.  Dude.  Like a man.  That drives me crazy.  That was a great ending.  That drives me nuts.  Wow.  What is he saying down the hall there?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm just curious.  I asked him if when his book comes out in April, he'd be happy to come back because  despite the tumult, that really sounded well.  He goes, nope.  Not doing it.  Good.  Fuck you.  Bye.  Don't.  We're done with this.  We've had intense discussions with the guy.  I walked with him into the elevator. 
[00:15:30]  And he always comes back.  And I said, Governor, I know that your feelings may have gotten hurt and you don't like Jim.  Who cares?  I don't like him either.  He's a silker.  I don't respect that little shit.  I don't respect him either.  I respect his military service, but I think he's a fucking.  I don't respect him in a debate because he's a baby who pushes his microphone.  Aw.  What's the matter?  You're not used to being challenged by a small guy, you fucking big dumb wrestler?  I fucking hate that shit.  I mean.  By the way.  It's not like I stood up and go, what? 
[00:16:00]  I would never do that, dude.  People are saying best ending ever.  By the way, yes, we did get that on video.  And boy, will that video be out.  I don't give a shit if he comes back.  That's a big one.  I don't care.  That's a big one right there.  That's a big one.  I swear to God, I don't care if he comes back.  Wait till you see Jesse's face on that video.  Honestly, God.  He wanted to strangle you.  Too bad.  I know.  Then don't argue with me on the radio.  Just bully me in an alley like you probably would have if you weren't a dumb fucking wrestler.  Big guys. 
[00:16:30]  I'm afraid of Jimmy.  No, I'm not.  Be more funny.  Dude, I really hate that shit.  I fucking hate that shit.  Bravo.  I mean, there's nothing.  I hate it.  Honestly, there's nothing I can say, the listeners can say, Anthony can say.  It's a bravo all the way around.  I would never have tried to speak that way to Jesse gave you.  Bravo.  Wait till you see this fucking video.  It was to nose and just, you did not back down an iota.  But stay, no, I won't back down.  I know.  That's just it.  But again, if it came down to a real fight, the acknowledgement is, the guy's going to  murder me.  I don't know if I've got to fight Jesse.  Of course he would. 
[00:17:00]  It's not about that.  It's an argument.  Even if it was a small guy or a woman I was arguing with, which is what I am to him.  It was that whole push the mic away.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Don't try to fucking alpha mail me in an argument.  That's what he's doing.  We had a really good discussion with the guy, too.  Why did it have to end there?  Because he's a guy like...  You know what?  I'll tell you what.  I know why.  I started fading out.  I'll be completely honest.  What got to him at the end there?  I didn't like when he goes, well, you don't like the Constitution.  He doesn't like me because I don't agree with him.  And I'm fucking...  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  He put fucking words in my mouth.  And then he called me an asshole and I called him an asshole. 
[00:17:30]  And when Jimmy was in his mouth, he had no defense for it.  Because that's what he is.  He's one of those big bully motherfuckers who likes to use his size and his weight.  And he talks over everybody.  And he's not a dumb guy.  I'm not going to say, so what?  Fuck him.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's not a dumb guy.  I just want to see Jimmy look.  I just disagree with him.  Don't turn around, Jimmy.  Don't turn around.  I respect the guy's military service.  I respect the guy.  He's a bright dude.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's just more radical than I am.  But that, when you're arguing and that disagreeing, that fucking...  Like, that's all of a sudden the atomic bomb? 
[00:18:00]  I'm going to use my...  Fuck you, man.  You know what you should do?  Bend him over and humble him.  You fucking DS.  I fuck you in DS and humble you.  I don't care if he...  That little shit.  That's what I think of you, you big fat motherfucker.  Beat it.  Steve.  There was a point...  No, I'm sorry.  Anthony, there was a point when Jimmy turned all the way around.  Jesse was at the doorway.  Jesse was debating...  I'm coming back in.  So what?  Oh, yeah, he was.  No, I'm just saying.  I know he was.  I'm just painting the picture for everyone.  There was a moment there where Jesse's like...  I wasn't.  At all. 
[00:18:30]  I think I've got to go back in there and hit this guy.  I was scared for you.  And then, at the last second, turned and walked away.  Because when he drank his water, I thought he was going to throw the bottle in the face.  And I would have thrown mine at him and got the shit beat out of me.  Believe me.  That's what I was thinking.  That's why I started getting afraid.  And then Kenny would have had to come in and...  Oh, it would have been awful.  Kenny.  I want to talk to Kenny for a minute.  I want to know what Kenny was thinking.  I've been boxing lately.  I would have tried something.  Would you knock it off?  Dude, I would be annoyed at a small guy for pushing the microwave during an argument. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  But Jesse was having a lot of time to say what he had to say.  Yeah.  We were arguing back and forth.  He felt I put words in his mouth.  I felt he put words in mine.  But then to drop it like that, goodbye.  I know.  Fuck you.  We were promoting your show for the last 20 minutes.  Ask plenty of legitimate questions.  Yes.  Let him get his point across over and over again.  It drives me crazy.  Where would have been that fail-safe point where you had to jump in?  Because you held off.  You didn't do anything.  You didn't get in between anybody.  What were you thinking during that whole thing? 
[00:19:30]  I was keeping my eye on him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Now, what would you think if you had to go against Jesse Ventura?  Bye, Jim.  Ronnie B.  After O&A.  It's live.  It's after O.B. Anthony live.  And that's the reason why Jesse Ventura no longer does the O.B. Anthony show.  He left in a huff that day and never came back.  I believe that was in 2009.  Was that November 2009?  Yeah, that was around there.  So, how long ago?  Is that a year and a half now? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  He's been in this building like three times since then.  He really comes to serious a lot for somebody who lives...  He was in yesterday and I think he was in Friday as well in the afternoon.  Plus, he was in a few months ago.  For somebody who lives out in New Mexico with no electricity...  Mexico.  It's not New Mexico?  No, he's in Mexico.  No, he's not.  He's in New York.  He's here all the time.  Well, wherever.  It's just a bullshitter.  And that reminded me too, you know, Jim was making fun of him.  This is not the first ex-wrestler that Jim got into a fight with.  Of course, he got into his classic confrontation with Chris Jericho several years ago. 
[00:20:30]  They've since amended their friends again.  Jericho was on the show with Cheryl Burke on Friday and I didn't get a chance.  This was Jericho...  Chris Jericho and Cheryl Burke as they left the studio on Friday.  Chris Jericho, Cheryl Burke.  How'd it go?  How did it go today?  Same as always.  It's always a ridiculous morning of comedy whenever you go on the O&A show.  And then with the added addition of Jay Moore, wow, the jokes were flying. 
[00:21:00]  Chris, you're more experienced with this, but Cheryl, this is your first time here.  Was it uncomfortable moments?  A little bit uncomfortable, but it's okay.  I'm good with uncomfortable moments.  It's just I would have to be careful not to get fired from a Disney show.  You did a good job of not cracking under pressure.  I'll say that.  Good.  No, she's good at it.  That's hard.  I mean, my communication is normally like that on a personal basis, but not in front of people.  And the thing is, too, but only is they're harmless.  They're not mean, so they just say some shit and then move on to the next thing. 
[00:21:30]  Speaking of mean comments, did you really mean those things you said about me in there, about  my hair and eyebrows?  100%, as I mean it every time I say it.  You actually repulse me.  Okay.  It is like one step closer to my grave knowing that you're still going to be here.  And someday, someday, if you get hit by a bus and aren't here on the day I arrive, I'll  probably have one of the best shows of my life.  But until then, I have to put up with it and adapt.  But you know what my name is, right? 
[00:22:00]  Sam.  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  Because there's like two Sams in the world.  I know Sammy Hagar.  Cool.  Sam.  You.  Not so much.  My last name's Roberts.  Never remember that ever.  Well, thanks anyway.  Didn't know that and didn't care.  All right.  We'll have a good time.  All right.  How come everybody makes fun of me around here at E-Rock?  How come every time we have a guest, Jason Ellis is raping me.  Wrestlers keep making fun of me.  I don't understand this.  Are you mad because that used to be Bob Kelly's responsibility?  He used to rape you all the time. 
[00:22:30]  Now it's Ellis.  I don't like that talk.  I don't like that talk at all, E-Rock.  I'm just going based on show history.  No, I don't like that talk.  I'm going to ask the guest booker.  Roland, how come guests continuously insist on making fun of me, making a mockery of me?  Because you make a mockery of them.  Mockery of them.  You know.  I don't make a mockery of guests.  Not all the time.  Not all the time.  Well, they say you're too resistible.  Irresistible?  Well, not everybody rapes me. 
[00:23:00]  And that was just Jason Ellis.  I'm talking about the wrestlers who make fun of me.  They're jealous.  Now, Roland, what do we have for this week?  Thanks.  Yeah.  E-Rock, isn't there anything you should be playing?  What the?  Boy, somebody's good on their feet today.  Because look who just came in.  Great radio.  I don't know what he was waiting for.  Ron Bennington is in the studio.  Eric, what?  I was like, I don't know.  What were you waiting for?  I was talking with Chris Stanley, sorry. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  Chris Stanley's fault.  No, not his fault.  It was my fault.  He really is blaming people.  E-Rock is the king of excuses.  He makes the excuse.  No, no, no.  And then he goes, no, no, no.  Not an excuse.  But you should know this.  Somebody else's fault.  No, we just have to get out on time today.  They have a big guest at the top of the hour.  Well, we...  What, by the way, what the...  Well, Chris Jericho did on Friday, and then earlier in the week, Triple H had made fun  of me.  The Rock?  The Rock made fun of me.  He told me to stop interrupting him.  Jason Ellis came in here and attempted rape. 
[00:24:00]  Literally.  Why only attempted?  Well, I mean, he only got to the underwear level.  What's the weird thing on your mic?  What is this...  Oh, this weird thing is actually just something that's broken.  That's the other...  Oh, I thought that you were doing that on purpose.  No, the bar broke earlier.  That's going to be so comfortable for Fez today.  Yeah, and so then you just have to position it there.  There's a change!  There's a change!  Fez isn't a change guy?  You would think he's Mr., you know...  Go with the flow.  Easy knees.  Adapt.  Hey, stay loose.  Wow.  But ever since that thing with Roland... 
[00:24:30]  How are things with Fez and Roland?  Fez hates Roland.  That's not good.  Roland hates him.  I don't know how he says.  I moved on.  You moved on, but his reputation hasn't.  Oh, and the reputation is as a result of Roland's actions?  Roland's gossip.  So even somebody in the...  Or a troupe yesterday.  Still?  Yeah.  They just don't get over it.  They actually said, do me a favor when this guest comes in, and it was Mr. Dennis Quaid. 
[00:25:00]  They go...  Oh, I heard that interview.  Ugh.  Some, you know, some actors are just like, I go where they tell me to.  They don't have a lot of interviews.  Right.  But he did look exactly like Dennis Quaid?  He looked like Dennis Quaid, but tired.  He wasn't into the whole junket today, I guess.  No, and it was a junket thing, so I just decided when I got annoyed with him, to throw in his brother Randy.  What's going on there?  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Because it was one of the things not to say, and then when I'm like, all right, you're not giving anything else away, here's where we go. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, well...  Here's where we go.  Yeah, I mean, I guess that is the responsibility of a guest, that if they say, this is what you can't talk about...  You gotta be interesting, you know, and I'll try to be interesting with you, but if you're acting like, I don't know a lot about movies, I'm gonna go, okay.  Well, then let's move into the other area.  Yeah, we'll go into that.  You know, how's your exes?  How are they doing?  Yeah, and the kids.  You know me, Roland.  I'm work first.  I will talk about their work with them.  Now, it's the work first.  But then if you're not giving me, hey, what did you do to the fez?  And then I slide back into that, and then suddenly you get the kids, like Sam, like, soul. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  You see?  Yeah.  Gossip.  Making headlines.  Right.  You're the only radio guy who's not constantly looking for that sound bite.  Don't want one.  Don't want a sound bite.  But they do have Vera today.  She's awesome.  She is a genius.  Who?  Vera.  Vera Formiga, you would know her from The Departed.  Oh.  Up in the air.  Oh, my goodness.  And one of, I think, the best junkie movie that's ever happened called Close to the Bone.  Most people overblow the hey, we're addicted. 
[00:26:30]  Sure.  She got it 100%.  She is, in my opinion, an artist.  Yeah.  And I had this conversation yesterday between actors and movie stars.  Like, actors care about the work.  Movie stars are like, you're saying, go for the sound bite.  Right.  What do I have to do?  Tom Cruise, movie star.  Movie star.  What about Dennis Quaid after your experience yesterday?  Movie star.  Movie star.  He's definitely a movie star.  Now, he sees himself as an actor.  Since he doesn't even really relate that much, he's, you know. 
[00:27:00]  And movie stars are ready to talk in sound bites.  Like, they come with their sound bites in their head.  And this is what, whatever question you ask them, they're giving you the sound bite.  And I want to get something straight here, and I think Roland would back me up.  It's not very easy to be a movie star.  It's a very difficult thing to be Tom Cruise, to be that kind of guy, Sly Stallone.  Will Smith.  Will Smith is a movie star.  And now, it doesn't mean that he doesn't have talent, but he kind of puts Hulk Hogan, movie star. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  I get it.  Movie star.  He was like, well, wait a minute.  How does this affect Hulk Hogan?  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  The image.  Right.  I can't ever lose, because, or if I do, it's got to be a cheat, because I've got to keep  on being Hulk Hogan.  And a lot of people got mad at him, but he's still Hulk Hogan to this day.  So movie stars are more concentrated on the brand that they've created.  They've created themselves as a brand.  Yeah.  They kind of put themselves above it, where the actor will go, well, what's the entire story?  Christian Bale's actor.  Who's that?  Christian Bale. 
[00:28:00]  Same place to go with it.  All right.  I'll do that.  But we would think of the fact, like, Gary Oldman is an actor.  Right.  And he's like, oh, I'm going to disappear into this part, where I think Will Smith goes,  this is going to be great for Will Smith.  Yeah.  And then let's see if I get my kids involved.  Those kids are the most confident children I've ever seen in my life.  They really are.  I mean, how can you be that good at that many things at such a young age?  I mean, not even any life experience is needed.  The fact is, they're not good.  And yet, they come into the room confident. 
[00:28:30]  Their confidence tricked me, I guess.  Like if Jada, I don't know, what are the kids' names?  Uh, uh, Willow.  Willow and Aiden.  All right.  Here's one.  Willow.  If Willow goes on The Tonight Show, she thinks, how lucky Jay Leno's get Willow in there.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, Jay Leno has made it.  Right.  Willow's blowing this shit up.  Yeah.  And I'm like, somehow those parents, maybe they did the exact right thing.  I don't know.  But they're way more confident than most people. 
[00:29:00]  But can you imagine, like, even the biggest movie star, when they first started their parents,  they were like, wow, I'm finally here.  Can you imagine completely skipping that process in your life to just be like you're born and  you're already a star.  Right.  Like, you've already made it.  There is no goal.  She said, hey, what's up, Jay?  When she sat down on the couch.  Yeah, like, I'm supposed to be here.  I was born here.  Let's see you dance, Jay Leno.  Shake your hair back and forth.  Everybody's doing it.  But I guess that those Smiths, they just really gave the gift of confidence to those children. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, but they're also obnoxious.  So I think that's the trade-off.  Well, we only have to hope for some kind of Danny Bonaduce's crash.  Yeah, just something to really bring him back down.  Because even when that happens, Danny Bonaduce is still a confident guy.  He's got nothing going on, but he's still confident.  Well, you know, there is a certain type of guy that will be like, I want to tell you  a story about my asshole.  You know what I mean?  Like, there's nothing off the table.  There's nothing private. 
[00:30:00]  There's nothing that they need to keep to themselves.  Right.  It's all out there for you, the public.  And the public...  But they want to share it with the public.  They can't wait.  The minute you stop asking about his asshole, he goes, what's going on?  I need to share this information.  Or if suddenly the public's looking at someone else's asshole.  Well, I'm sure there's a ton of people furious, but going like, I'm crazier than Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  I should be making that kind of cash.  Well, the Balloon Boy dad was back on YouTube trying to make a Charlie Sheen video.  I don't know if you saw it, but TMZ...  No, I didn't say that, but I did want his back scratcher. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he can't just let it go.  Like, he was already in the press as being a horribly neglectful parent.  Right.  But he realizes there's more negative publicity to be had.  I have to have it.  What did he want with Charlie Sheen?  He decided to...  He made some music video with a comedian called Count Smokula.  All right.  That guy's good.  And he played Charlie Sheen in Count Smokula's Charlie Sheen song music video.  Do me a favor.  Get me Smokula for the next unmask.  He could be great.  And he does have face paint on, so it's a literal unmasking, too. 
[00:31:00]  So, we are doing Most Annoying Sound on O&A.  And I keep meaning to get to this earlier on after Opie and Anthony Live, but Dallas comes  in and attempts a rape.  Who knows?  But this is another...  We played Koke...  Earl!  Earl Douglas?  Hello.  Yeah.  What's he got to say?  This is more important than...  No, do your best.  Speaking of Most Annoying Sounds, Earl Douglas is on the phone.  This is...  I don't know who sent it in, but we've been getting submissions.  You can send them in to opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  This is an example of a good Most Annoying Sound. 
[00:31:30]  And the winner is going to get $2,000 from Steven Singer.  So, here's a good Most Annoying Sound.  Hello, Jews.  Jigaboo.  Diggle.  Kikes.  Mick.  Faggots.  Spook.  Chinks.  Wap.  Diggle.  Dykes.  Faggots.  Mick.  Gooks.  Mick.  Jigaboo.  Chinks.  Faggots.  Jews.  Diggle.  Dykes.  Spook.  Gooks.  Jigaboo.  Faggots.  Kikes.  Wap.  This is Jim Norton, and I do approve of this message. 
[00:32:00]  That's annoying, and I feel a little misrepresentative.  Roland, does that mean I saw you?  I didn't hear it before I played it.  I got it from the guys in the back.  Roland laughed.  He's not here anymore.  Roland is gone.  That's Earl, I guess.  I got good news for you.  Earl just told me that the dots are starting to connect.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, fantastic.  Roland, I don't know if I want to play one of the bad, but if that's a good one. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  I'm on the air here.  I don't know, man.  I'm on.  Yeah.  Maybe we should just call it a show.  What do you say, buddy?  Yeah.  We got to get out of here.  Roland?  I would.  You're petrified.  Do you have anyone lined up for the rest of the week?  I hope he's flying this one solo.  I do.  Just waiting for some.  Is Jay coming back in?  I don't know if he is.  He was on the phone today.  He might next week.  Next week.  Depending.  Is Opie flying solo next week?  Anthony won't be here next week, and we still don't know whether Opie will be. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  That's the way Opie rolls, though.  Holy shit.  Opie's shaking the core of the earth right now.  I mean, he had planned on taking vacation.  Yeah.  But, you know, maybe I'll give him a few days.  Maybe I'll give him a few extra shows.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's Opie, though.  Hopefully Monday.  What's that mean?  Roland's banking on some guests coming through.  Okay.  They're ready to go.  Just have to wait.  Speaking of guests, we can't go long today. 
[00:33:30]  And by the way, we missed you very much on this show yesterday.  It wasn't the same.  I was here in time.  You guys left very early yesterday.  We left on...  That's on time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't know.  And we have to leave on time today.  You have a guest coming up on Ron and Fez.  Zero Formiga.  Stay tuned for that.  After Open Anthony Live, we'll be back tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next. </pre>
