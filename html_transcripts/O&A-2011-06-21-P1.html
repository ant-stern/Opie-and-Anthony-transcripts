<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Larry King's introduction, immediately transitioning into a heated discussion among Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts regarding their dissatisfaction with SiriusXM.  They aired their grievances about perceived underpayment, overwork, and the company's refusal to reinstate interns, using highly offensive and vulgar language to express their contempt for a specific SiriusXM executive.  Sam Roberts's recent reprimand from management was dissected, with speculation on the methods of manipulation used.  The contrast between a planned $5,000 listener prize for a "phone show" and their staff's low wages fueled their anger.  Other topics included their dislike of peanut M&Ms,  a preference for alternative brainstorming methods over meetings, criticisms of network television's outdated language restrictions,  recollections of experiences with shows like *Breaking Bad*, *Game of Thrones*, and *MASH*, a humorous anecdote about a Lady Gaga encounter, and the invention of "Yawn City" to satirize bureaucratic inefficiency. The hosts also discussed chess and online gaming.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a Bobby Fischer chess documentary and the looming possibility of a call from their boss, Bob, regarding their on-air behavior.  This led to complaints about Bob's preference for coach flights. The "Dick of the Day" award was given to an individual who married very young (details unspecified).  The upcoming appearance of Cameron Diaz as a guest was mentioned.  The hosts praised Roland, their guest booker, for securing high-profile guests such as Michael Potts, and commented on the recent death of Ryan Dunn, also mentioning interviews with Scott Muni and Alan Alda (which were briefly satirized).

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on Ryan Dunn's death, covering the circumstances of the car accident, including allegations of drinking and driving, and the ensuing Twitter feud between Bam Margera and Roger Ebert.  Zach Hartwell, Dunn's passenger, was identified.  The hosts heavily criticized the media's coverage and its focus on Dunn's Jackass persona.  They discussed and praised a clip from Jackass, and a listener offered additional details about Dunn's activities before the crash.  The discussion included listener calls, the aforementioned $5,000 phone show, a NASCAR ticket giveaway, and a debate on contest rules.  Their own morbid curiosities and hypocrisies regarding tragedy were also addressed, culminating in a detailed account of one host's recent road rage incident and his aggressive driving tendencies.

A significant segment centered on a heated debate involving E-Rock's refusal to do push-ups for money, escalating from $180 for 18 push-ups to $1000 for 30.  Opie, Anthony, Troy, and Sam expressed their frustration with E-Rock's perceived laziness and lack of motivation. E-Rock defended himself by citing his wealth and preference for leisure activities, including consuming copious amounts of sugary drinks, watching cartoons, and collecting wrestling figures.  The humor stemmed from the increasingly absurd bet offers, E-Rock's relaxed demeanor contrasted with the others' agitation, and the use of "treats" to refer to his sugary drinks.  The segment concluded with a challenge: E-Rock would experience Troy's active lifestyle, and Troy would experience E-Rock's sedentary one.  Sam relayed an insulting message from another individual directed at E-Rock.

Another segment featured a volatile argument between E-Rock and Troy, fueled by their contrasting lifestyles and eating habits, particularly their consumption of fast food (Wendy's was repeatedly mentioned), sleep problems, and late-night snacking. This was followed by a cynical discussion of Tracy Morgan and Joe Coy's public apologies, which the hosts viewed as insincere and driven by pressure from groups like GLAAD.  The hosts imitated Tracy Morgan and discussed Joe Coy's apology in detail.  The conversation touched upon Louis Farrakhan's criticism of President Obama, Obama impersonators, a caller questioning Anthony's familiarity with *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, and a news story about a man urinating in an Oregon reservoir.  The "Tetley Tea" jingle became a recurring, tangential topic.  A future "phone show" was mentioned.

The final segment began with a discussion of Bill Tetley and the cancellation of Norm's sports show, attributed to low ratings, with Travis offering a mixed review.  The hosts then recounted a story about a drunk, naked man performing surgery on his Doberman Pinscher, resulting in felony charges.  The search for a specific Tetley Tea commercial featuring Asians on YouTube proved unsuccessful.  An elaborate (and ultimately revealed to be a joke) escape plan from the studio was detailed.  Several 70s Tetley Tea commercials were played and critiqued.  The arrival of a large box of condoms, sent by a listener supposedly at Jim's request, led to graphic jokes about sex and condom use. The segment concluded with a Quiznos commercial read, a comedic bit involving the sound "mm-mm-mm," and nonsensical phrases about a "good boy's phone."  No guests beyond Travis were identified in this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on SiriusXM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You should get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Badaway.  Badaway.  Badaway.  Badaway.  Badaway, Larry King, you stole my Badaway.  Badaway.  Morning.  Yeah.  How's it going, Dan?  Doing good.  Oh, it's my Tuesday?  I know.  It's still heaven. 
[00:01:00]  We put like two days worth of show in one day yesterday.  Two days of goodness.  Yeah, I think we've got to slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  We don't want to burn ourselves out, Sam.  Pull back a little, phone it in.  Just chill out, maybe do a phone show today.  Yeah, the phone show.  Do a phone show for two hours.  Phone show.  Phone show.  A phone show.  Oh, brother.  They sent out a massive email for the phone show.  They were so excited about the phone show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:30]  Phone show.  Phone show.  We should show them how a phone show is done, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Show them how well it works.  Can we do a phone show?  Of course.  No, I mean officially.  Yeah.  Maybe not today, because we've got to get a lot of production behind it.  Maybe get some press releases.  We need a mass email to the entire platform.  It's got to be huge.  And what?  Prize.  And some sort of a prize?  Well, they're giving five grand away on the phone show.  How?  How do they determine that?  To the best phone show guy? 
[00:02:00]  On Thursday, the best caller gets five grand.  Who determines that?  Wow.  I guess Steve Sturdy, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Who came up with this idea?  It's got to be a ton of rules.  One of the bosses.  Oh.  Which one?  I don't know.  A real one or a cute one?  Is it a cute one or?  The cute one.  It's not one of our bosses.  Ah, okay.  Write it down.  Is it a boss we used to know who makes believe he doesn't know us?  Uh-huh.  Oh. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, I don't know.  I don't even know what that means.  Oh, please.  Really?  Oh, he did?  Oh, of course he did.  I don't know.  I don't know who did.  Of course he did.  Who wrote?  I don't know who did.  Oh, God.  I don't know who did.  I have no idea who came up with the idea.  Poor Sam.  Poor Sam's just a beaten guy now.  I don't know who came up with the idea.  Remember when Sam was all rambunctious and shit?  They beat him down a little bit.  He's still got some edge to him.  But boy, have they taken a file to your edge.  All I'm saying is I don't know who came up with the idea. 
[00:03:00]  I don't know anything about that.  Sam's going to be very quiet today.  He's not that new razor that's just out of the package.  He's the one that tugs a little now on the hair.  You're like, ah, ah, that kind of hurts a little.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam might be a bit quiet today.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  The strip's not bright blue anymore.  No, it's not bright blue.  It's all slimy and clumpy.  Yeah.  You're like, one more shave out of this one.  Yeah.  You're going to be quiet today, huh, Sam?  Not your fault, Sam.  And you're going to be all right.  We'll see where the conversation goes.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:03:30]  The position you're in today, that's when me and Ann fucking ramped it up.  That's right.  So we'll see what you got in you.  That's when you sit and go.  We'll see what you got.  Yeah, but that's also when you start talking about your F.U. money.  Nope.  We did this pre-F.U. money.  We did this way before F.U. money.  We'd go, oh, contraire.  Here's what we're going to do.  So we're going to see what you're made of.  Because you're in a position right now, you either fucking cater to the man, or you ramp  it up like we did.  Okay.  And we did not have F.U. money.  You don't think I could find a comfortable medium? 
[00:04:00]  Me and Ann ramped it up when we were still commuting together, living in shitty apartments  in Huntington.  It works for you guys.  Real shitty apartments.  With shitty people.  Shitty people.  And shitty pets.  Shitty apartment.  Shitty pets.  And I had to deal with shitty landlords.  Oh, everything was shitty.  Everything was just shitty back then.  A lot of shitty shit.  So we'll see what you're made of, sir.  Okay.  See if you got some little moxie. 
[00:04:30]  Maybe I'll just call the phone show and rant.  Yeah, you can do that.  The phone show.  Come on.  Yeah.  Can you do voices?  I don't know.  If you do it in voices, you're okay.  It's like Mr. Abbott.  Howard taught us that years ago.  Yeah.  As long as you're doing it in a character, you're fine.  Maybe A.J.  Poopie shits will come back.  See?  Did A.J.  Poopie shits ever get a talking to or anything?  No.  He never did.  See?  There you go.  So A.J.  Poopie shits isn't happy with his contract.  I don't know anything about A.J.'s contract. 
[00:05:00]  Although you don't even have a contract.  They don't even respect you enough to give you a contract.  I don't know anything about what you're talking about right now.  Here's some change.  And some cans you can return.  You don't have a contract?  Well, I mean, I have a regular...  Oh, boy.  ...employee.  You know, all the employees.  I'm just an employee.  It's serious.  Oh.  Not that it means anything.  It's not binding or anything.  No.  I'm binding.  Contract means nothing.  Did you sign anything?  Non-compete. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that's nothing.  Yeah, you know.  Non-compete's even hold up, though.  That's after they fire you.  Yeah.  So that means...  Oh, never mind.  Right.  We'll see what you're made of, Sam.  What do you mean?  Nothing.  I thought we were going to slow it down today.  I thought we were playing for Sam, man.  Sam is a little shaky in his boots over there.  Just a little bit.  Coast into Wednesday.  Someone may have put the fear of God in him.  No.  No.  No.  Not at all.  They're really good at... 
[00:06:00]  Just speculating.  Just speculating.  They're really good at guilt and somehow spinning it, making it feel like it's your problem and  your fault.  It's basically your fault that you're underpaid and overworked.  That's how they do things around here.  You guys are nuts.  Yeah, we're nuts.  You guys are crazy.  They try to guilt you into the fact that you're the problem.  I love how Sam's zigging and zagging. 
[00:06:30]  He is zigging and zagging today.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Don't sweat it.  No.  Worry about what?  Exactly.  Like Sam said, he doesn't want those dickheads getting him again tomorrow.  I know.  I didn't say that.  Oh, of course not.  That's ridiculous.  I had three messages from one of the cute bosses, a text message.  I'm like, no.  I'm not fucking talking to you today.  You didn't take that call?  I did.  You did?  Yep.  And was it about this?  Nope.  It's about something else?  Oh, boy. 
[00:07:00]  And I was like, no.  Here was my answer.  Here was my answer.  No.  Well, um.  No.  Did you talk to Hopi about this?  No.  Um.  Not yet.  I figured I'd give him a call.  I'd go, oh, good luck with that.  I'll, um, I'll talk to you.  Bye.  No.  Bye.  What's going on?  Apparently.  Shh.  Shh.  It's all on the QT.  Okay.  Keep it under your hat.  But apparently, today, after work, there was supposed to be a meeting. 
[00:07:30]  With us?  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing, nothing big.  It's a meeting about, let's just say a meeting about maybe getting out and doing some appearances.  And things.  Yeah.  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  But that was it.  I told the guys down the hall, I mean, if they want to pay me to do extra, I'll go out and do something.  But it isn't even the meeting, like the reason for the meeting.  That isn't what I said, like, good luck with that is.  It's who we have to meet with. 
[00:08:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's what I said.  No.  Good luck with that.  Who do you have to meet with?  Is it somebody at Sirius?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, this?  You got it, you got it.  Oh, yeah.  No.  So I said, I said tomorrow, which is today now, you know, today.  Wait, who said?  Yesterday is tomorrow.  Who said they want us to meet?  Gary made the phone call.  No.  So.  GS said you had to.  So I was, yeah.  So I was on the phone with Gary and we talked about that and I was like, well, good luck 
[00:08:30]  with that.  I go, by the way, tomorrow, I said tomorrow.  No.  Which is today.  No.  I have to drop off some of those certified bank check things for the apartment.  You have to return some videotapes.  I have to return some videotapes.  I have to drop that off.  I can't do it.  I got to be out of here at exactly 10 o'clock.  And then tomorrow, I got the traffic thing, my violation. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  It seems I was a little overzealous on the skinny pedal.  But I'm getting that taken care of.  But it's through, you know, judicial system.  And then the next day, I do have a 10 a.m.  My yearly physical there with my doctor.  So both of those days, I have to cut out of here a little early tomorrow and then the  next day.  So then he said, well, I know, you know, Friday is not a good day for a meeting, but how about  Friday?  I went, well, no.  I go, you're right.  I got Friday. 
[00:09:30]  Friday is not a good day.  I got Friday.  Friday is not going to work because I'm going to have to do a little radio without you and  I'm going to be extra tired.  No.  Thank you.  So I suggested.  No, I do not meet with that guy anymore.  So I suggested.  Only through my agent.  No, I'm not meeting with the guy.  Well, no, I suggested this.  This is becoming real now.  I'm not even doing a bit.  I don't want to meet with that guy.  This was my suggestion.  And it had nothing to do with it.  And why do we have to meet with him?  Because now you got me going.  Well, because he wants to discuss us going out.  Well, I gave the idea. 
[00:10:00]  We want a real fucking reason to go out.  Not taking wireless mics into Times Square.  I think we just bring the walkover back.  To where?  Where are you going to go?  Around the block?  To my car in the garage.  No.  In a circle?  And we'll have a drive over to my house.  So I said, just push.  I said, push it off.  And maybe Monday.  But that's when he said, I said, have you spoken to Opie about this?  He said, no.  And that's my final words was, well, good luck with that. 
[00:10:30]  Because I hope we'll just handle it while you're at the doctor.  That could happen.  And that's not reasonable.  No.  At this point, I openly have a problem with the guy.  So, no.  Well, the best way with problems is to sit and hash him out.  Like Sam does.  Conflict resolution.  Yeah, yeah.  You sit there, probably in a smaller chair, looking up with your neck craned up, as they're  in a bigger chair looking down at you, doing 99% of the talking. 
[00:11:00]  Conflict resolution is biting a wallet so you don't bite your tongue while your asshole  is being opened up.  Exactly.  How about he comes up with a real idea, then he calls my agent, which is also Ant's agent,  and then our agent will then give me a phone call and say, this is what's on the table.  The go-between?  Yes.  The buffer.  Yeah, because I can't do any more bullshit meetings with a guy that barely listens.  No, it ain't happening.  I'd rather get fired at this point.  I can't meet with the guy anymore. 
[00:11:30]  Interesting.  Interesting.  I'm not even joking.  Exactly what my answer was.  Have fun with the show.  I said, good luck with that.  Have fun with the show without me, because I can't do it anymore.  Now you got me going.  And then I came in here in a good mood.  So how about Friday?  No!  You think Opie would be good Friday with the meeting?  Yeah, have you spoken?  And when he's bringing all this up, that's when I went, have you spoken to Opie about this?  And he goes, no, not yet. 
[00:12:00]  I was like, yeah, so my call here is kind of a moot point.  Maybe you should hit on that first.  Oh.  You were supposed to be the nice guy call?  It's good cop, bad cop.  No, you.  I'm usually just, I don't, I don't give a shit.  I'm beating down Sam Roberts cop.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, you do.  You're in the same place.  I know, believe me.  Just not as vocal.  No.  Although getting more vocal by the day, which is nice.  Oh, by the day. 
[00:12:30]  I'll tell you, I know, I'll say that I know the guy ripped us off and I can't even look  him in the eye anymore.  I can't even look him in the eye.  Then how are we supposed to meet on Friday?  And then some of the, I'm going to make a Friday meeting awkward.  Friday.  Do you know how I'd be looking at that clock on a fucking Friday?  I told Ant, look, I've had issues over the years.  Absolutely.  I'm the first to admit it now.  And I've worked on a lot of these fucking issues.  But he's a guy, I told you last time, when I leave his office, it puts me immediately 
[00:13:00]  in a bad mood for two to three days.  Wow.  Not one day.  Two day bad mood.  Not a few hours where I could just like blow it off or maybe get a good night's sleep  and I'm fine the next day.  It's two to three days.  Do you get a, honey, how was your day?  You wake up in the morning still in a bad mood?  I'm not joking.  That's never happened to me.  Two to three days.  Wow.  And in general now, I move on from shit.  I really do.  But not, no. 
[00:13:30]  Because I know he ripped us off and I can't look at anybody that I know ripped us off.  So every morning, every morning it's like this.  Oh, what?  Oh, get that, shut it up.  Oh, that fucking, ah, shit.  Look, I know.  Two days later.  I know it's a problem and I know it certainly will affect my career, but I don't care. 
[00:14:00]  I don't.  And it's not the I don't care, which means I care.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I can't, I, ah, no.  Is this it?  Is this it?  Oh, God.  Oh, pretty good.  Pretty good night's sleep, actually.  Ah.  Go to the show today.  It's, you know, fun.  It's, a few hours of going in, have some fun with it.  Oh, God.  What's, something's been on my mind again. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, a meeting with that?  No fucking way.  No way.  Look, here's the deal.  It's, we got a contract.  I'll honor the contract.  I love coming in here.  I'll say it every day.  I love doing radio with you guys.  But that's the stuff I can't do anymore.  Yeah.  Because it puts me in an instant bad mood.  And, and the fact is, him just casually saying, I think you guys should take wireless mics and walk around Times Square. 
[00:15:00]  That's what he thinks of us in the show.  Yeah.  And that's why I have a major problem here.  A major problem.  We're not the kind of show that just walks around with mics in Times Square and goes, hey, let's talk to the guy that's playing the spackle bug.  I wouldn't even do it to the phone show kid.  Nah, really.  I wouldn't even tell the phone show kid, take a wireless mic and walk around Times Square.  I wouldn't even do that to him.  But that's really what he thinks of us in the show.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  And I've known it for a long time.  It's like, oh, here's the big get. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Naked cowboy.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  I'm interviewing him in Times Square.  Talk some tourists.  It'll be wacky.  I do that shit on my own time.  Oh.  Yeah, right?  That's my thing when I'm not here is wander around and fucking talk to weirdos.  How about, hey, we're here in the M&M's store.  Opie, your favorite coating?  I'd say brown M&M's like them.  No, you got to go with them.  Probably the only brown thing I like when in my mouth.  If you're going to the M&M's store, it's got to be your favorite.  Making a pussy joke. 
[00:16:00]  Your favorite color.  Yeah.  They have many different colors of M&M's now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They all taste the same, though.  There's no difference in the flavor.  I know, but it just looks nicer.  I like the peanuts.  Red dye number five.  Oh, the peanuts are pretty damn good.  I hate peanut M&M's.  I fucking, on minibars when I'm on the road, I can't, I just, I got two bags of peanut  M&M's.  I have to eat them both.  Oh, Jay.  And I refuse to look at the calories.  I just won't do it.  Well, if you don't look, then it doesn't count.  That's right.  What's better than fucking peanut M&M's?  Oh, they are great.  God, they fucking are good.  I like regular M&M's.  I do, too. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  This, oh, oh, okay.  See?  What?  See?  Sam's a good egg.  What happened?  He just wrote, M&M talk equals better and safe.  Which is Sam's way of reminding us, hey, assholes, get back to attacking.  No, it's not.  Of course it is.  Hey, guys, what are you doing with the M&M talk?  Here's Sam going, hey, faggots, enough of the candy talk.  Go get them.  Sam, when you steered the guys to the M&M conversation, that's the kind of things we need you in there 
[00:17:00]  for.  Happy to do it.  I really...  Happy to do it.  Sam City...  Oh, sorry.  Oh, God, no.  No, Sam City had to take a trip to Yawn City yesterday.  Apparently meeting with someone.  Yawn City, that's great.  Oh, we got to take a trip to Yawn City over there.  I haven't had the conversation with Sam, but I do know that I would guarantee that somehow  they spun it to make it your problem.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a problem.  And that you should be more appreciative of making no money and working your balls off. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, the money's not an issue.  I wouldn't talk about that.  I would guess that's what happened yesterday.  Right, Sam?  We're going to be working together on some solutions to the problems.  That's good.  That's good.  Behind the scenes.  They said that three months ago, so good luck with that.  To kick it upstairs?  No, we're going to be working on solutions to problems.  Where's behind the scenes?  I know where upstairs is.  Where's behind the scenes?  It's down the hall.  Oh, Yawn City?  That's not what I call it. 
[00:18:00]  I will...  I want a Yawn City...  Like, Yawn City Limits.  Population fucking three.  No, you know how you go on vacation and it goes, uh, uh, Los Angeles, 10,800 or whatever?  Can we have one of those signs on the door that says Yawn City and then...  And then pace it off.  And then point it down there.  That's about 200 yards.  Yawn City.  Yawn City.  Yawn City.  Oh, does that sum it up?  It sure does.  I can't sit there with almost passing out. 
[00:18:30]  I'm almost passing out.  I...  We heard you guys talk...  This just happens.  Jimmy and Obi are yawning to each other.  I don't know how you do it, Ant.  God bless you.  Because you could...  Eh, whatever.  I'm the consummate diplomat.  But see, now they're going to be...  They're going to come to us soon and say, you guys are bitching too much.  It's not good for the company.  Not good for...  Isn't bitching good?  It's not good for bitching.  I was taking the California term.  Sorry.  It's not good for Howard Stern's money. 
[00:19:00]  You know, they're going to...  Oh, boy.  You know, it's going to affect his money somehow.  There's a difference between bitching too much and what we are, which is much too bitching.  Yes.  We are much too bitching.  That's how it works.  We're much too bitching, and we don't go to Yawn City, man.  No, man.  We have a much too bitching fucking sign, too.  M2B, and we ain't going to YC.  I will give solutions today.  Ooh.  We're fucked because we're in a contract.  Language.  I want...  If you want less bitching, it's really easy. 
[00:19:30]  You pay the guys who work for the show what they deserve.  Uh-huh.  They're not looking to...  A dollar?  Exactly.  They're overpaid as it is.  They're looking for a fair compensation.  I'm looking for the founder youth.  What do you want?  They're way below what they should be making, so we bitch about that.  Below.  We want our interns back because we kind of need them for this type of radio show.  That's just a radio show.  Remember, you said you were working on that and making progress.  That's now...  That statement is now at least two to three months old. 
[00:20:00]  At least.  Yeah.  And they told me that they were making progress.  How long does making progress mean?  It's akin to troop withdrawal, Opie.  Right.  You make progress, but it does take time.  You know, years.  Thousands of innocent lives.  And there's nothing in my contract that says I have to meet with that guy at all.  Yeah.  And, you know, we could go through agents and stuff.  That's fine.  And I certainly will get out there and do some fine stuff with the listeners because we love  doing that, but it's got to be something big and over the top.  It's got to be the right thing.  And I don't need to, like, have a brainstorming meeting with a guy that's absolutely not going 
[00:20:30]  to listen whatsoever because he's waiting for the next celebrity he needs to sign.  We're already...  I guess we're working privately amongst the show on a paintball game or something.  Yes.  Yeah.  See?  See, paintball game would be good.  Listeners are involved.  It's outside.  It's outdoors.  It gives us great material for the next day.  Yeah.  The animation festival would be great.  Animation festival.  I threw that...  I already threw these ideas down the hall.  Fantastic.  To bring that back because it was a great event.  Yeah.  And we would love to do another, you know, comedy show when Jimmy's anti-social thing 
[00:21:00]  has run its course.  You know what?  You can't get down there and talk, though.  Right now we're supporting Jimmy and what he's doing, but as soon as that's over, we  would love to, you know, maybe get another comedy thing going.  The problem is you're telling them...  I wouldn't want that to interfere with the show thing.  No, it's fine.  You've got your own thing right now, man.  I'm fine doing something with...  The problem is you're telling them this.  What you've got to do, get your idea, tape it to one of the tumbleweeds that roll through  Yawn City.  And maybe someone will pluck it off.  And the best place to put an idea is on the underside of your mouth so when you go... 
[00:21:30]  And then you can read it on the roof of your mouth.  That's a great idea.  Those are real solutions to our bitching.  And it's going to take one of the cute guys to actually break the wall and talk to people  that could actually get some of that stuff done because those guys can't.  Yeah.  They can't whatsoever, okay?  And that's a lot different than taking wireless mics to Times Square.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  And anything in between, I'm not fucking doing.  Simple as that.  And they can talk to my agent. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, there you go.  Bobby.  I can't believe this was the spin today, Ant.  Dust will come off of his phone when it rings.  Yeah.  He answers it.  He has to pull one hand off his chest, which is crossed over.  Of course.  That little skinny box is hard to get his phone.  He's reaching into his pocket.  He's knocking against the side of the wooden box.  He keeps pulling up handfuls of dirt from his home country.  Transylvanian ghoul.  Bro, the guys don't want to go to Yawn City.  They're tired of being bored, bro. 
[00:22:30]  They will not meet with you.  Nope.  Ah!  Very frightening when Bob calls.  We should actually get little, little things that we attach to our eyelids, which we press  a button and it makes them blink like we're listening, but we're really fast asleep in  Yawn City.  I love that.  I need that.  Take the first exit off of Snoozeville.  Snoozeville is a little mile down as Yawn City.  Yeah, it's just outside of Yawn City.  Guys, I need to... 
[00:23:00]  Oh, it's Mayor McBoring here in Yawn City.  So there you go.  Gave you solutions.  Yeah.  Some of those things get done.  Guess what?  We don't bitch as much.  Yeah, we're good.  You know, these guys haven't had raises in years.  Years!  And they've all taken on more responsibilities.  Raise.  Travis went from an intern to the executive producer.  He gets the same pay.  As an intern.  Wasn't he an intern?  At one point, he was an intern. 
[00:23:30]  And he's making the same money.  Oh my God.  That's like a PFC grade pay for a general.  That's what's happening.  Nonsense meetings I don't do anymore.  That's the beauty of having FU money.  I'd rather walk.  Oh.  They got FU money.  They looked at him and said, FU, take this.  Yeah, no kidding.  I cannot believe this is the spin on that phone call that I didn't take.  That was the spin.  I thought it was because of young Sam.  No, no.  They could give a shit. 
[00:24:00]  And how they had to possibly beat him down a little bit.  After hours.  Like we have to deal with this lower echelon bullshit.  Right.  No.  Sam got whatever he got, and we don't even have to know about it.  I didn't get anything.  Yeah.  Talk among yourselves.  Sam said he was not happy.  And that somebody, whoever it was he met with, just talked to him.  And then Sam was like, is this it?  Can I go now?  Yeah.  Can I leave?  Right already.  That wasn't my attitude.  And his mouth opened hugely, and he went, ugh. 
[00:24:30]  And we all knew it was done.  Yeah.  Time for him to leave.  It's not Yawn City.  It's Six Flags.  Oh, is it like Six Flags back there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure it is.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I have good relationships.  Yeah.  You sit.  You talk.  In a civil manner, right?  Yes.  And you hash things out, and things are being done behind the scenes.  Problem solved when things connect.  Where's the scene, first of all?  Behind the scenes?  Because doesn't the scene, in order to go behind the scenes, doesn't there have to be  some kind of a scene somewhere? 
[00:25:00]  I don't see any scene down there.  There's the curtain or something.  Yeah.  Directly.  This is Studio 54, and there's some big happenings behind the curtain.  There's not.  The only rope I want around people's necks.  Yeah, exactly.  You got us, the blacks, and the gays.  That's our neighborhood.  And the NFL guys.  This is not a fun place.  It's your own city.  Ah.  Yeah.  Did Jess have to take some of the abuse because of yesterday?  Yeah.  Did she have to take some of that?  Ah.  Sorry, honey. 
[00:25:30]  I've just been out of bed.  Exactly.  Put a stake on that.  Yeah.  Bring it over.  I didn't come home in a bad mood, and I certainly didn't wake up still in a bad mood.  No, you didn't wake up still in a bad mood?  No.  Two-day bad mood.  That is classic.  Look, I know that's my problem.  I'm not saying that's normal.  No, it's hilarious.  At least I could finally admit it.  Instead of trying to walk through and making believe there's no issue.  That's what happens, though.  I think it's a chemical that releases in my body.  Is it really? 
[00:26:00]  It just takes a while to go away.  It squirts out somewhere in the brain.  Yes.  It just takes a while.  It permeates the air for a while.  Yes.  So that's why I try to avoid those situations.  It's like Casey Anthony's trunk.  Just wafting and doesn't go away.  The same killer people get.  The same killer.  Same chemical people get in the Long Island drugstore, I was going to say.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's murderous, but I tripped on it.  That guy.  What a naughty boy he is.  I tripped on my joke.  It's okay.  Let me go to Nate in D.C., and then Marcos in Yonkers has a great solution to one of 
[00:26:30]  our problems.  All right.  Nate first.  Nate.  Hey, how far is Yon City from Howard Stern's fantastic vacation island?  The complete other side of the building.  You can't get further away.  Yes.  Yeah, that is party central over there.  They should have palm trees to the entrance to his part of this place.  It's like a resort over there.  It's like a resort.  It really is a resort.  This place is like Disney World with all the different lands. 
[00:27:00]  It's so fun now.  It is.  There is.  There is this Yon City.  Vacation Island.  Vacation Island.  Remember, we used to say that we were an island among ourselves, and guess what?  Not much has changed.  I think we're still an island.  What's our island called?  Oh, God.  Shit Island.  Shit on Island.  We're at Rikers.  Rikers.  In fact, this is Rikers Highland.  None of the toughness, just the unpleasantness.  They need their whole staff being raped. 
[00:27:30]  This is the island where we allow you to shit on the beach.  It's great.  Disney.  No problem.  It's like Disney.  Let's go to Marcos in Yonkers.  Marcos.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, my boys.  I know.  I wanted to say, how the hell does the bosses have $5,000 to give away in a shitty contest,  and they don't have money to give in an ONA contest or anything like that?  Yeah.  I mean, Sam is the poster child for being underpaid and overworked, but I want to say it again. 
[00:28:00]  Literally a child, too.  Because I know all the guys that work for the show are underpaid, by the way, so I don't  want them to think that we're just focusing on Sam, but he's kind of on the poster right  now.  I'm the union rep.  Yes.  And that is a good point.  So they got $5,000 for one caller to the phone show.  It's a contest.  The phone call show.  What is it called?  The phone show?  The phone show.  The phone show.  Hosted by Steve Sturniolo.  But in the end, people...  Who?  Mama Mia, Robin. 
[00:28:30]  Love that name.  Yeah, he's got beaten pastos out of his ears.  Oh, Chip.  Ears.  How that happens.  But the logic behind a phone show, people would just call that because they would be excited  to hear themselves on the radio, so you don't really need money to give away as far as something  like that goes.  But it creates a bigger buzz.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, buzz.  Phone show?  It doesn't create any buzz.  People are just going to do it because, wow, listen to me on the radio.  They're going to call their friends.  I think I made it.  So you don't really need to give money away to a show like that.  And then you can take that money and give it to someone that hasn't had a raise in three 
[00:29:00]  years.  Oh.  It's a little bump up for somebody, at least.  I want to say something real quick.  Talking on the whole Sam being paid and interns and stuff.  I'm a bus driver.  And I'm not one of the Sam haters.  I love Sam.  But let me tell you, I make $1,000 a week after taxes.  And I'm a bus driver.  That's pretty good money.  You bribe a dust.  Maybe you ought to drive a bus then, Sam.  Yeah, you want to drive a bus maybe?  I know how to drive.  All righty, guys. 
[00:29:30]  Sam, you've said too much already.  I'm trying to say.  I don't know why you haven't just kept your mouth shut.  You really are getting yourself deeper into some shit here.  Just be appreciative.  We're all talking about M&M's.  Just be appreciative.  Exactly.  Well, at least just don't completely motherfuck them.  Leave them no wiggle room.  You want to talk about M&M's again?  Yes.  How about his goddamn studio over there that he never shows up in but makes millions of  dollars and the staff is underpaid?  Oh, that guy.  Right?  Oh, you didn't mean that?  No.  I thought you meant that M&M's.  You like peanut or boring flavor? 
[00:30:00]  What's your life?  Boring.  Yeah.  They have a big bowl of Z's and Z's over there.  Sam wants some green M&M's as in moolah.  Yes.  Love saying moolah.  Moolah.  Wait, M&M, since the last time we talked about this, he must have visited this place since.  Well, his album came out in November, I think.  That was the last time we talked about M&M and his channel?  Yeah, that was the last time.  So, when was the last time he was on his own channel that he's getting paid millions of dollars for? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, the Slim Shady channel.  Yeah.  Well, he might have done something out of his house.  Since November?  Yeah.  Because he had a new album come out.  What does that mean, though?  A quick phone call?  No, he probably had an ISDN in his house.  And did what?  A four-hour shift?  No.  I mean, like, an interview.  Does his agent get called every day he's not in studio?  And yelled at?  Does that happen?  He's got a different deal.  It's more about the branding than the...  Oh, okay.  I thought. 
[00:31:00]  See, my mistake.  He's not the morning show host over at Shade 45.  My mistake.  Morning show, it starts at noon.  Yeah, they're still doing the overnight shift over there.  That's a great gig over there, man.  A little later, but...  They're still doing overnights.  Oh, that's good.  I like their Kevlar curtains to keep us all safe.  See, get it?  There's gunfire.  What time do they start the morning show, Shade?  I think it's at eight.  It used to be.  Come on.  That's...  Oh, that's racist.  Why is it eight?  Is there stuff playing on the...  Oh, because...  Is there stuff playing on the overnight that they... 
[00:31:30]  I don't think so.  That's playing into a...  What's playing there?  That's playing into a stereotype, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, what's happening...  I thought that was a joke, but they really start at eight?  I think.  I'm not positive.  Do they go from eight to noon?  Not till noon, I don't think.  I'm saying that would be from five to nine on the West Coast.  Shade 45.  Eminem's uncut hip-hop channel.  Yeah.  And if you go to the website, it really looks like Eminem's there all the time.  Yeah, he's right there.  He's as big as the buildings. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, he's as big as the city buildings.  But the best we could say is that he might have done an interview, one interview since  November for his own channel.  Possibly.  I can't confirm or deny.  We can't even confirm that?  Wow.  When they hire a stupid, month-long, a 40s channel host.  What?  They always bring in celebrity hosts?  What are you doing?  Why do you need that?  For the 40s channel?  They hired a big name?  For what?  That's money for guys that are underpaid, man. 
[00:32:30]  He might not like it.  I won't like it, and I know I won't like it, too.  Who they hired for the 40s channel.  Who's on the 40s channel?  The new host.  Yeah, he's just doing a month-long thing, playing all his favorite hits in the 40s.  Who's doing it?  Damn it.  Bill Tetley.  No, no.  Bill Tetley.  Wow.  Do you have any jingles?  By the way, one of my greatest moments was yesterday in the car, and Ope's in the front  seat, and I just know how his OCD is, and I just hear, wow. 
[00:33:00]  Wow, Bill Tetley.  Wow, Bill Tetley.  You're finished.  Wow, Bill Tetley.  That's all I was doing.  If he's doing it out loud in the car, it's going to be a long day.  It just doesn't stop.  It pushed the anger down, so I thank you.  I was fucking so happy with myself.  That pushed the anger down.  Another level, so thank you for that.  But you don't know the joy I felt in the backseat when I just heard, wow, Bill Tetley, and  I just knew.  Yeah, I'm finished.  It's going to be a Lulu.  Mm-hmm.  Ellie, wow, Bill Tetley.  I had a meeting recently. 
[00:33:30]  You had a meeting?  About what?  About the incident.  It wasn't a bad meeting.  What incident?  Am I playing into something else?  No, no, no, no.  The Lady Gaga incident?  Yeah.  Who do you have to meet with?  One of the bosses.  And what did he say about that?  How did he spin that instead of just doing the right thing?  He was apologetic about it.  See, some things are better taken care of behind the scenes. 
[00:34:00]  Those scenes again.  Please tell me you didn't accept it.  Maybe when you were face-to-face, but when you go home.  There was, I mean, it obviously still bothers me.  That's like, that's something that should have just been done.  There was one.  That's a no-brainer thing you just do for somebody.  There was one, I'll say this, and I'll tell you what, there was one point that was raised,  which I was like, eh, all right, which kind of made sense.  I'm not saying I was, believe me, believe me, I don't agree with it. 
[00:34:30]  But there was one issue that was raised that was like, okay, well, technically I didn't do that.  You didn't have to.  All you had to do was stand there and get a picture taken.  No, so they'll always spin it and make you feel bad about yourself, like you're the problem.  No, I didn't feel bad about myself.  I felt very...  When we were yelling and screaming during contract negotiations, they said,  it's my fault that I tweeted a picture that we might have had bedbugs here,  and that's why, you know, the company wasn't going to take care of us. 
[00:35:00]  You know how enraging that is?  That's the tact they used, or is it a tactic?  It's all something.  That's the tactic?  I think that's what they used against me in the end.  Even though they were going to give me, you know, give me, I'll talk for myself,  they were going to give me the same money no matter what, but they had to spin it that way,  knowing I was pissed off.  Like, nope, it's really your fault.  You really shouldn't have done that.  They do like leaving you with nothing to say.  Right.  Like, they don't...  They like the last word kind of a thing.  That was absolutely told to me.  So they pile some things on you, and then you're like, I'm just leaving. 
[00:35:30]  I'm just going to walk out.  I'll say this.  I felt...  I wasn't as angry at all after the meeting.  I felt better after it.  And my argument at the time was, look, you know, this is something,  if you're a talk show host, you're going to mention.  If you see these bedbug signs everywhere, it turns out the place didn't really have bedbugs,  or it was isolated or whatever.  We don't have bedbugs here.  And I go, look, you don't think Howard, when he comes back from vacation,  is not going to talk about it?  And of course he did.  And they used his clip on every news entertainment show. 
[00:36:00]  My dumb little tweet compared to him getting exposure all over the place  for doing the exact same thing.  But they used it against me.  Yeah.  And that's why I'm...  That's when I said, wow, now I know what I'm dealing with here.  So.  Yeah, there.  I have no time today for any, even a short chat. 
[00:36:30]  No.  Can't do it.  This is a very bad week.  Because I'm thinking there's going to be this.  This is going to be the, hey guys, I understand the whole thing.  You want to talk about what's going on and everything.  But, you know, it's been a couple of days in a row and, you know, starting the show off  with that whole, you know, thing.  We're all working on things.  We are...  When's the next train out of yawn city? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Well, because that's what the meeting will turn out to be.  Thank you, sir.  I guess it'll be under the guise that, look, man, trying to do some things with you guys,  but we'll sit down and then, you know, he'll look us right in the eye and give us a fucking  talking to.  A talking to.  I gave solutions today, though.  I go on record.  I gave solutions.  You got a lot of bitter people because they haven't had raises in a long fucking time.  I'm talking just about our show, but I've seen it in other places, too.  Man, man, man, man. 
[00:37:30]  And that's where a lot of this shit comes from.  And then, of course, we got punished for something that happened, but they still won't give us  our interns back.  That's just ridiculous.  It's completely ridiculous.  And that's all Travis's fault.  It's nothing to do with us.  But we have to pay.  But that's why...  I'm just tossing people under buses today.  That's my job.  But logically, that's why he still gets paid like an intern.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they use that against him, too.  There's always something to use against somebody.  They use that against him six months later.  Oh, but we're working on things.  Enough with the working on things. 
[00:38:00]  Stop.  We're working on it, Popeye.  Yeah.  All right.  I watched all the...  I think I had two more episodes of Breaking Bad.  Oh, yeah?  Third season.  Finished watching that, and then I took the disc, the magic disc of the brand new  first episode of the season that hasn't even aired yet, and we'll watch that.  So now I'm in a position where no one can spurl it for me.  You like it?  Yeah, I do.  I have...  I got a rolling game-y copy of Breaking Bad.  We have the ones that got coming in.  The lead, I think, is coming in.  Yeah, I think when the show kicks over in July again. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, July.  Okay.  A couple weeks.  I saw the first two episodes.  Yeah.  I have to get into it.  Right now, I'm in the middle of Game of Thrones, which I'm on, like, episode seven of  that, which On Demand is amazing.  Love On Demand.  I fucking...  I really like this show.  I love On Demand.  Breaking Bad, I watched the first two episodes of.  I had problems with it.  Yeah.  But it's not like I think it's a bad show.  I just didn't love it.  But I'm gonna...  I'll give it another...  The second episode I liked a little more than the first episode. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, they do kind of set up.  I think the acting is very good.  The guy in the lead is great.  Yeah, he's really good.  And my only issue with it was, and again, maybe this goes away, was that I felt that  they over...  They needed too much to justify why he was dealing or making meth.  Like, I understand that you have to give a reason, but it was like, okay, he has inoperable  cancer.  I mean, this is all from the pilot episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He has inoperable cancer, and the kid's a dud. 
[00:39:30]  It's almost like they put him so far against the wall.  That it's palatable for anybody.  It reminds me of what I don't like about Dexter, which is that it has to be a serial killer  killing serial killers.  Killing serial killers because they have to make it acceptable, whereas The Wire...  HBO doesn't make their shows really acceptable.  Like, The Sopranos is what it is.  It showed mob guys, and they killed their own.  I mean, they killed Big Pussy in season two. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And The Wire, they showed whatever.  Well, let me just tell you, though.  In later episodes, without spoiling anything, this isn't a spoiler or anything, but the dynamic,  especially of his character, does change to where it doesn't just turn into a, I have  to do this for my poor family, my son, and the fact that I have a terminal disease and  have to, you know, I want to get money to take care of my family.  He actually does start, like, if, for lack of a better term, getting into it. 
[00:40:30]  Okay, so that dynamic changes.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll keep watching it.  As soon as I'm done with Game of Thrones, I'll go through these.  There's, um, and it's AMC, right?  But they have language freedom, which I kind of like.  It's like a lot of them, they're cursing, right?  Yep.  I thought I heard a few F-bombs, whatever.  Yeah, yeah, they're cursing.  I love the fact that.  They're cursing.  They're cursing.  You know who you'd thank for that?  FX.  Fucking Leary and FX are the first ones, I think.  Say shit and blowjob.  Yes. 
[00:41:00]  Fucking asshole.  To use the cables.  Yep.  That's how you compete with the Showtimes, the HBO, and Cinemax.  Real language.  If you use the freedom that they have made so long, they're kind of, what separates them  from you is this ability to be real.  Absolutely.  So I kind of respect FX.  I know Louis does it in his show.  There's a lot of, forgive me, saltier language.  Salty language.  They just don't use the F-bomb in there.  Louis?  Yeah.  Can they say fuck, but not motherfucker?  I don't know.  I haven't heard of fuck.  Oh, maybe they can't say fuck. 
[00:41:30]  I've seen fuck bleeped out.  They say pussy and shit.  They say shit, pussy, cock.  On Louis?  Yeah, yeah.  See, I don't even notice that anymore then, I guess.  I just feel like I'm watching a show and it doesn't shock me anymore when you hear.  No, it doesn't.  Remember when that first hit, you're like, wow, did they just say shit or fuck?  And when bastard, when they first said bastard on TV and you were like, what the fuck?  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  When Hawkeye said that on MASH.  Yes, that was a big one.  To make, that's like 81.  Oh.  You son of a bitch.  You couldn't believe you just said that. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  I couldn't believe it.  Then the big one, Greg Suck My Cock on the Brady Bunch.  That was so...  Oh, cutting edge.  And then Greg is mushing his hair in the mirror, going, gotta suck dad's cock.  Diddle-doo.  Diddle-doo.  It was a very special episode, though.  Yes, it certainly was.  That's why I got away with that.  But do you remember that in MASH?  Yeah.  I told you, I talked to Alan Alda about that when I finally got to talk to him.  And he liked that somebody recognized the language barriers there, bro.  I don't remember that.  Mako, there was a North Korean woman who Alan Alda was fixing. 
[00:42:30]  She was enemy.  And so Mako, who played like 30 different roles over the years...  Is every Japanese or Korean guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He was the South Korean soldier who wanted to take her and question her.  But Hawkeye is just like, I just fixed her.  And he's like, well, you have done your job, Captain.  Now I'll do mine.  And he's like, you son of a bitch.  And they all pulled up their rifles.  Yeah.  And now it's like, eh.  But back in 81 or 82, you were like, I fucking can't believe he just said that.  It's like, what?  I can't believe he just said son of a bitch.  Phones ringing.  And it actually made the paper like, oh, holy son of a bitch. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  It's big.  Yeah.  Now.  Who cares now?  Well.  You hear, fuck, you don't even think twice about it unless it's on network.  Oh, they do on network.  Oh, look out.  So stupid.  It's so behind the times.  That's why they're just going to fucking keep dwindling.  Their audience is going to keep dwindling and dwindling.  They occasionally get these giant shows that have great ratings.  But for the most part, no one.  Who's watching network television primarily anymore?  How have you let AMC and FX be the talk of the town, as it were, when you're CBS, ABC 
[00:43:30]  and NBC?  How the fuck have you allowed that to happen?  I understand HBO, but.  We've got XM and Sirius.  Same thing.  Oh, mighty.  It's amazing how no one's.  What do people in this business do?  Put on blinders and open their assholes and go, I double dare you?  What the fuck do they do?  I double dare you.  Cable's understandable, but network, I just don't get.  Did we name our island yet?  No, not yet, really.  Because.  We have.  Mark at Buffalo writes, don't forget E-Rock's favorite spot on the island. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, where is that?  Feeder Point.  Feeder.  Because he likes to eat.  It always goes back to E-Rock.  E-Rock.  All right.  Why don't we take our shirts off, take a break.  I like that.  That sounds nice.  With men.  I like men and digging to this radio show.  Don't these eggs look good?  These actually look good.  They look fluffy.  I hate the look of those eggs.  I love a good fluffy egg.  Egg whites can suck my dick.  Lucky them.  It looks like albino skin or something. 
[00:44:30]  Ew.  Ew.  Sorry about that.  Game of Thrones is so good.  You should watch it.  I'm like sandwich.  It's great, dude.  I heard.  You know what?  Well, you got to stick with it.  Yeah, yeah.  And you got to start from the beginning.  Yeah.  Oh.  Listen, that means having an hour to yourself.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you could do it.  You know what?  Oh, really?  I could do that?  While you're babysitting, you might be able to just...  You know what?  I have to go back. 
[00:45:00]  I'm on episode seven.  I have to go back.  I have to watch episode one again because I play.  I'm very distracted.  Like, I read a lot lately.  Flavor Flays' book was fucking great, by the way.  Reader.  I know.  It makes me feel like a queer.  Flavor Flays' book was fucking tremendous.  Much better than I thought it would be.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been obsessed with this chess game that actually Dominic turned me on to.  So it's the one where you play other people from all over the place?  Yeah, and you can wait hours to get them moved back or the next day or whatever.  So I'll stop and I'll play that and then I'll put it on.  But I got so distracted, I had to just stop and watch the show. 
[00:45:30]  You know, they do that with...  Is it Scrabble?  Yep.  Yeah, you probably can play it.  A lot of people are doing it with Scrabble.  That's such a great idea, man.  Where you could just be going through your life and have this game going on that takes  forever, but...  I have about eight games going at the same time.  Really?  And you're waiting for some of those guys to make moves?  Yeah, and some people will make it in real time.  I think that's the coolest thing.  So you'll wait a minute and get a move back or 40 seconds.  I used to love chess.  I don't know if I would do that one.  But maybe I would do Scrabble or something. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, it's fun, dude.  But Scrabble, I mean, you can look up shit, though.  That's not...  You know what I mean?  I was playing...  Excuse me for eating eggs.  I thought you were going to break.  I bought...  Let's go to break, then.  I got like four chess apps.  Yeah?  I'm just not that good.  Oh, no.  You're pretty good, but I guess...  I'm not good.  But then when you start playing, people all over the place, you realize maybe you're not.  But Jimmy is pretty good.  You're pretty good at chess.  I'm...  I played a fucking...  Yeah, it's called Chess with Friends.  Sam said words with friends. 
[00:46:30]  Chess with friends.  Yeah, you're among friends, Ricky.  Don't cut your wrist over the rook.  And when I play a computer, like this fucking thing, on a middle level, it just massacres me.  I mean, like this Fritz is one that all the grandmasters play with.  It's unbeatable.  Un-fucking-beatable.  Have you ever played chess in the park?  No, those guys are good.  Those guys are animals.  They're good.  Who was the guy in Boston we used to see, eh? 
[00:47:00]  You were up there a couple times down at Cambridge.  No, never.  You never went there with me?  Hell no, I was drinking.  Back in the day?  There was a guy in Cambridge that...  I was in some Ashland shithole bar.  But I forgot what it was, but he basically beat you in 90 seconds or something?  Oh.  Maybe a Boston guy could call.  He's legendary in the Cambridge area.  He has a sign-up, takes on everybody, and beats just everybody.  See, I never played on a clock.  Those guys play speed chess.  Yes, it's all memory.  They memorize the openings, which is part of the gift of being that good at it. 
[00:47:30]  That's why Bobby Fischer creates something called Fischer Random, where the rook and the  pawn and the bishops and the knights were all placed in this weird order, so you couldn't  just pattern the first 20 moves.  Bop, bop, bop.  They all know.  Okay, well, that's this variation of this defense.  That's the Sicilian.  That's this.  So for them, the first 10 moves, everything you do, everything they do, they know exactly  what the next 20 possibilities are.  So there's no real...  I can't say real thought.  There's a lot of real thought.  But it's hard to be creative, I guess, until you get to a certain point in the game, unless 
[00:48:00]  you do something fucking crazy.  But if you do something fucking crazy, it's probably been thought of and just doesn't  work.  Wow.  So he's good?  Well, that's what Fischer did when he played...  It's good at chess.  But the documentary, fucking Fischer's documentary on HBO, when he played Spassky, he did this  weird knight move where he left his knight hanging in the corner, which Spassky just  wasn't ready.  It just fucked him up.  It wasn't a...  It was a weird move, and Spassky hadn't fucking prepared for that.  Like, wow, why'd you do that?  And there was no computers.  They didn't do computers back then. 
[00:48:30]  You had a guy with you.  Right.  Yeah.  A guy you called your second.  Really?  And Fischer and I think a priest with him named Bill Lombardo, or Lombardi.  And that was his guy.  He brought with him.  Vince's brother?  And what did they do?  They just played chess, and it would help him analyze games.  Wow.  I'm boring myself.  But the Fischer documentary on HBO is great.  I'll check that out.  Yeah, it's really sad.  All right, we're going to take our shirts off and take a break.  We're going to give out the Dick of the Day award.  This guy is the biggest dick.  But we did already.  Wow.  Ah, Sam laughed. 
[00:49:00]  You're going to get a shit.  Yeah, I see something I found online.  Oh, okay.  There's consequences to what we just did.  Trust me.  I want to get my picture to us.  Consequence is a consequence, as long as I'm rich.  That was taffy.  Love that episode.  I think today's consequence will be a call from Bob.  Oh, guys.  You've got to.  You're really going to have to.  I just got off the phone and.  You'll have to calm down with the talk.  This isn't good.  Oh, boy. 
[00:49:30]  You know the radio business is a disaster.  We need these guys right now.  And you're.  Oh, Jesus.  You're here walking on thin ice.  I don't do.  Oh, boy.  I think I might have to take a flight from L.A. to New York.  To have a.  Have a who gives a fuck breakfast with you guys.  Who gives a fuck?  His dumb coach flights.  Why don't you stop it?  Why don't you stop it, you fucking chiseler and pay for at least business class, Bob?  I'm on the first of my three stopovers and my layovers before I finally get there. 
[00:50:00]  I'm going to be in New York next week.  Hopefully we can work this out.  Will he be here next week?  I haven't seen Bob in a long time.  I'd love to see him.  Wow.  Bill Zetley.  Yes.  All right.  Well.  Dick of the day.  A guy marrying extremely young.  And we all know who this guy is.  We do?  Oh, yeah.  See, I didn't Google image him. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Please.  I can't wait to see who it is.  Oh, yeah.  Farrakhan.  That's a murder in the White House.  Yeah, I finally agree with Farrakhan.  Fucking.  No, I don't.  Dana White can't be happy today.  Well, yeah.  I'm doing teases off the top of my head here.  Cameron Diaz will be here today.  Cameron Diaz will be here.  In the building.  Her nice legs.  Nice legs.  She'll be in the building today.  Not on this show.  Later.  Well, she's not doing any morning stuff.  Oh.  Believe it or not, no complaints about guests. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Well, Roland has been doing a fucking phenomenal job.  I'm pretty fucking happy with the amount of guests and the quality of guests.  So, there you go.  There's a positive.  There's a positive.  The balance is this.  As much as we hate Roland, he does that good of a job.  He's really doing great, though, at guests.  Yes.  I mentioned Michael Potts from fucking...  And he gets him.  Yep.  He gets him.  We have him tomorrow.  He gets...  He's like that.  From the fucking biggest show on Broadway.  The two of the leads we get.  Yeah.  And we lost...  That's great.  We lost Ryan Dunn, too. 
[00:51:30]  We could talk about that, certainly, after the break, too.  All right?  Uh-huh.  Oh, Scott Muni.  Spoken word from the Vietnam era.  Wow.  Cool.  Is that cool for some people out there?  Yeah.  Legendary DJ?  Radio history.  Supposedly on the...  Supposedly on the tarmac when the Beatles landed.  Mm-hmm.  That guy, we worked with him at N.E.W.  He's now gone, unfortunately.  And Danny found Scott Muni doing spoken word.  That's where he found Earl.  He was a baggage porter.  When he...  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Is it the Pennsylvania station?  He left the microphone up.  All right.  I'm eating.  And now, Jim Norton interviews legendary actor Alan Alda.  Sorry, Alan.  I just cut a guess.  You're in your face.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Listen to that.  So, let's get to the meat of the issue.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  I was really lucky.  I must have had a light case.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Alan, you were a bit of a disappointment. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you very much.  It was fun, Tony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

Yeah, Ryan Dunn, man. 
[00:53:00]  That fucking sucks.  Twitter.  Twitter's a buzz, too.  A lot of people really bummed about the death of Ryan Dunn.  We didn't really know him.  We talked to a lot of the jackass guys,  but I don't think we ever talked to Ryan over the years.  No, not him.  Was he a little drunk, maybe?  Driving fast to the allegations that are being laid out?  Well, he tweeted a picture a few hours before the crash  and it looked like he was drinking, but I don't know.  That could have been his first drink.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:53:30]  If you see a drink in someone's hand,  you can't just assume that he had a shitload of drinks.  There is nothing left of that car.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  That thing just, like, hit, went over the guardrail,  into the woods, burst into flames.  And that's it.  Who was with him?  Somebody who was with him died, too, huh?  They haven't released that name yet?  Unidentified.  Unidentified.  Holy shit.  That nasty.  Someone tweeted me that stupid Roger Ebert had to, like, do a whole thing on drinking and driving. 
[00:54:00]  First of all, we don't know that that happened here.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  It's being assumed.  It's quite possible, yes, but we don't know for sure.  Yeah.  And Ebert opening up, you know, what's left of his fucking mouth.  He's got his plastic mouth now.  What's left of it.  Rubber face.  Decided yesterday it was a great day to talk about drinking and driving.  And Bam gave him a fucking talking to.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, he did.  I'm trying to find it. 
[00:54:30]  I want to.  Somebody tweeted this this morning.  Now I just got to find it really fast.  Ebert's.  I like Ebert's profile pic there.  He's kind of covering everything up, huh?  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, my hand's in front.  Like, I'm looking through a movie camera thing, but it's pretty much just hiding that fake mouth.  Oh.  Oh, is he?  Oh, okay.  Is he just?  Sorry about that.  Jesus. 
[00:55:00]  He's losing his mind.  Yeah, it's on TMZ.  So, uh, Bam writes, uh, is furious with Roger Ebert telling the movie critics to shut the fat fucking mouth.  To shut his fat fucking mouth.  Well, he can't.  Over a tweet Ebert posted earlier today criticizing Bam's friend and jackass co-star Ryan Dunn for drinking and driving just hours after Dunn passed away.  We don't know that yet, so I don't know why Ebert chose yesterday to do that.  Earlier today, after TMZ posted the story that Dunn was seen drinking at a Philly area bar before his fatal crash, Ebert posted a tweet that read, 
[00:55:30]  Friends don't let jackasses drink and drive.  Whoops.  That's pretty tough talk from, uh, Mr. Ebert.  After a day of silence, Bam finally went to his Twitter to blast Ebert late Monday night saying,  I just lost my best friend, I've been crying historical for a full day, and piece of shit Roger Ebert has the gall to put in his two cents about a jackass drunk driving, 
[00:56:00]  and he's one fuck you.  I don't know, I think he was trying to use all 140 characters.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, Bam added, millions of people are crying right now, shut your fat fucking mouth.  So, good for him, man.  Wow.  Good for him.  I wonder what Ebert's thinking, just thought he'd chime in with a funny gag, not think anybody was gonna pay attention.  Well, there's a way to say this, you know, you lost a good person to drunk driving, 
[00:56:30]  than to say jackass.  It's like, eh, I get the tie-in, but it's still kind of a cunty thing to say.  Right.  Well, I mean, the timing of it, you know.  Get on your fucking soapbox in a few days, but, you know, a lot of people are extremely bummed out.  Yeah, maybe the guys will do a PSA.  This is where you want to see guys do PSAs, like if the jackass guys do drinking and driving PSAs,  if that's what happened to them, that would have an impact.  Right.  Because they lost a guy that they genuinely, you know, loved. 
[00:57:00]  Yep.  That does suck.  We just had Steve in here.  Steve-O.  Yeah.  Steve-O, yeah.  Ride done was 34.  And I think he just did Minute to Win It with Steve-O.  Yeah.  I was half watching that the other night.  What is that?  That was him, right?  We have Guy Fieri's show.  Oh.  It's kind of like the old beat the clock.  Look, that guy's done.  I can take care of this.  Hey, who's my lucky?  Come here.  Come right up here.  There we go.  See if he can find it right in there.  Oh, there it is. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  I guess it was a bug.  Huh?  Was that a bug?  I don't know what it was.  Of some sort?  I don't know.  Put it in Ryan's beard, and then some girl plucked it out and popped it into Steve-O's mouth.  Let me say hi to Grant from Westchester, PA.  Grant.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, brother?  Hey, the report's out of here.  And Barnaby is one of our local bars here saying there are bartenders reporting that he had three beers and three girly shots. 
[00:58:00]  And that's what they say.  That's all he had.  So who knows if he was drunk or not.  But that's what they're saying.  All right.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Three beers, three shots.  That's a lot.  That's six drinks a lot.  Yeah.  Depends how long he was there, too, right?  Yeah.  Three hours, Ann?  What's that about?  They're saying he was there maybe three hours.  You know what it is?  You don't have to be smashed, but you have a couple of drinks in you. 
[00:58:30]  You kind of, your inhibitions might go away if you're driving that Porsche.  You know?  You might be like, yeah, I'll fucking goose this thing a little quicker than I normally might.  Was it a one-car accident that I know?  Yeah.  Did you just veer off the road?  Off the road, over guardrail, into trees.  Oh, fuck.  They got launched like fucking quite some way.  He was, they say he was going really fast.  And who was with him?  Was it a guy or a girl?  We don't know yet.  Unidentified passenger also, Ted. 
[00:59:00]  And a car burnt.  Look at that.  It's just laying in the woods.  There's nothing left of it.  There was barely anything left of Ryan Dunn.  Yeah.  And the passenger.  Yeah.  What did they find?  Burnt up.  Some of his beard and tattoos, I read.  Really?  And that's how they identified that it was him?  Jesus.  Was it from fire?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he got burned.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, that thing burnt into nothingness.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Yeah, that's what's left of the car.  Can you imagine?  I can't even see.  That's probably an immediate kill done impact. 
[00:59:30]  Huh?  You want to hope so.  Because the next stage is fucking burning alive.  Yeah, but if you're flying that far through the air.  If the car is that damaged, that's not just fire damage.  That's crash damage.  Right.  You have to be killed instantly from a car getting hit that.  There's no way you're living in that piece of metal while it burns.  Of course.  So, even if he was drinking and driving, I mean, Ebert just, you know, picked the wrong  fucking time to do that shit.  Yeah, give it a, wait till the fucking body cools. 
[01:00:00]  Give it a day or two before you, I'm told it's official.  Right.  You know, before you fucking just come out and blast the guy.  Mm-hmm.  He's just trying a fucking word play.  Yeah, he was trying to be clever.  Nah, I didn't think it worked.  But it's like, you know, if you've got half a face, shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think...  You can just look at him and go, look, he's already fucked.  Yeah, exactly.  Robert Ebert should shut his big...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  God did that.  Oh, right.  Should shut his big fucking fingers.  With his synthesized speech, he's synthesized.  Doesn't he have one of those now?  I guess, yeah.  Where he types things in and it talks like this.  Yeah.  The snap on jaw.  That's horrible.  Like snaps on.  It's horrible how he's living, but...  Jeez.  Yeah, he's got a snap on jaw now.  Really?  Yeah, you ain't seen it?  He doesn't have...  It's not on all the time?  Well, I think he's...  No, it's not permanent.  Why?  Fix it! 
[01:01:00]  I don't think they can.  That's like one of those face transplant things, but it's...  I think...  I think the cancer got him so bad.  I'm not saying stem cells will fix that.  Jaw bones.  Stem cells will fix that.  They'll be able to do that with stem cells.  You think?  Eventually.  Yeah.  Eventually, he'll be able to do everything.  He'll be able to cure the cancer, though.  Everything.  Let's go to Ellis in Philly.  Is this the Ellis?  Yes, it is.  Okay, so you're reliable.  What do you got?  On one of the local news stations, WPVI.com, they have all the information and they identified  the passenger as Zach Hartwell. 
[01:01:30]  Is Zach Hartwell...  Is he obviously a friend of Ryan's?  Yeah, he...  I believe he had some kind of...  I think he was in the Jackass 2 movie, and he had something to do with maybe the production.  It said that in the full press release from Bam's mom.  They quoted her in the article.  Hey, Speck and Zetak.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Every time I do it.  Every time.  Good show, guys.  Ellis.  Die hard. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Every single time.  All right.  Thank you, Ellis.  Oh, so it was somebody else that was involved in Jackass shenanigans?  I don't know.  They got some news things.  They came to the site of the crash for much of the day.  Fans of Ryan Dunn and his crazy addicts that have entertained on television and on the big screen.  But this was no stunt. 
[01:02:30]  This was traffic tragedy.  The accident that killed him and another person in his car.  It is Monday night, and the big story on Action News tonight is the latest on the death of MTV star Ryan Dunn.  Action News reporter Chad Perdelli is live at Barnaby's of America in Westchester,  where Dunn apparently spent the final hours before his death partying with friends.  Chad?  A manager here, Jim, says that Dunn and his friends had, quote, a few beers in a few shots,  but he did not appear to be intoxicated last night. 
[01:03:00]  We won't know for sure until talk.  Obviously, I don't know.  I wasn't there.  But, you know, a manager of Barnaby's is going to kind of protect their establishment.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  I hate to say it, but if we're getting all the facts out there.  He left here.  He was fine.  Yeah, man.  I only saw him do, you know.  Yeah, a couple beers.  A couple beers.  I hate that.  News reporter Chad Perdelli is live at Barnaby's of America in Westchester,  where Dunn apparently spent the final hours before his death partying with friends. 
[01:03:30]  Chad?  A manager here, Jim, says that Dunn and his friends had, quote, a few beers in a few shots,  but he did not appear to be intoxicated last night.  We won't know for sure until toxicology tests are completed, and that's expected to take about a week.  But here's what we do know.  Dunn has survived many wild antics on his hit show, Jackass, but he did not survive what appears to be a night of drinking and driving.  He points that right there.  This is why the fucking media is reprehensible. 
[01:04:00]  I know.  Did you have to tie in survives and survives?  The people who write the news, they're obviously failed at something else writing.  Yes.  He survived a bunch of his stunts, but he didn't survive.  Get it?  What does that mean?  Yeah.  We know what he did for a living, but we know he's dead.  You didn't have to tie it in to make yourself look smoother.  You have to be clever.  You have to look clever.  Yeah, just fucking report the news. 
[01:04:30]  Even though he's not trying to be funny, it's this tongue-in-cheek fucking snarky cunt attitude the fucking media has.  Sometimes just report the fucking news and don't worry about it.  He survived.  He didn't survive.  We got it.  We know what happened.  He was on Jackass, and he was killed driving.  Right.  We got that.  You could show off your talents with some kind of fluff piece, but this is news.  Just report the fucking facts that, as you know it, he's a reporter, Chad, he's weak, but here's what we do know. 
[01:05:00]  Dunn has survived many wild antics on his hit show, Jackass, but he did not survive what appears to be a night of drinking and driving.  Crowds continued to gather on Route 322, getting an up-close look at the debris, charred limbs, and tree trunks left behind by the fiery crash that killed Jackass star Ryan Dunn and his friend, Zach Cartwell.  We didn't really believe it.  I didn't believe it, and I just wanted to see what was going on. 
[01:05:30]  I had worked at Frasier Home Depot, and he would come in all the time, and he was just the nicest guy.  He was this.  Always polite.  What does this googly-eyed bitch say?  I know, right?  What does this have to do with this party?  She has hair like squiggy.  This is valueless.  Her eyes were going in two different directions.  These fucking morbid assholes who are trying to stop and see where the body flew out.  That's all they are.  These are the people that tie up in traffic because they want to see the crash scene.  Why do you have to go and see where the guy died?  I don't know, but a lot of people like doing that shit. 
[01:06:00]  We didn't even believe it until we came down here.  Why do you believe it now?  It's morbid.  Why did you think it was a lie, but you believe it now?  Just admit you wanted to see where the guy died.  For what?  You could probably pick up girls down there, though.  Right?  Someone sad, maybe.  I bet if you went there, yeah.  Just talk.  You could talk about the Jackass movies and be like, yeah, man, fuck, man.  What are you doing?  You want to head out?  I don't want to be alone tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  We could talk about them and shit.  Before you know it, the googly eyes are looking up at you. 
[01:06:30]  She's just sucking your cock.  It's just what flashed in my head.  I'm not saying I disagree with using tragedy to segue into me blowing a load in someone's face.  But I just hate these people that go to crash scenes just to see where he died.  It's like there's something so fucking sickeningly morbid about that.  They set up an impromptu memorial.  I don't know.  You would fuck the googly out of her eyes.  I would so just get the googly right out of her dumb, dumb looking fucking eyes. 
[01:07:00]  She's awful, too.  By the way, she's South Jersey awful.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Hit it.  I went level-headed, and I think this is just poor judgment on his part.  That's because it appears after a night of drinking at Barnaby's in Westchester, Dunn  got behind the wheel of his 2007 Porsche.  These are photos posted on Twitter shortly before the crash.  Police say he appears to have been traveling at a high rate of speed when he tried to take  this exit and lost control, went airborne over the guardrail, and died in a ball of flames. 
[01:07:30]  Our officers tried to get to the vehicle but could not do that, and surely after they  pulled back a little bit, the gas tank exploded.  Dunn grew up in the area and was best friends with skateboarder and jackass creator and star  Bam Majera.  He was in Phoenix doing promotional appearances when he learned of the wreck.  Majera's mother called it a horrific tragedy.  I really can't even believe it now that he's gone, and it's just that he was the sweetest,  nicest, kindest person, would do anything for you. 
[01:08:00]  His girlfriend Angie is in our thoughts and prayers, and the Hartwell family, we just can't  even tell you how hard-broken we all are.  It'd be fine if he came up dressed like a zombie behind her because he isn't really dead,  and just went like, ah, and April's like, ah, you bastards!  And it was just a gag.  See, that would be funny.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, you know, it's not true.  That's probably not the case, yeah.  No.  And he gave me, I think Ryan Dunn gave me the biggest laugh I had in the jackasses, which  they're all funny, but he's the one who was, they were on the seesaw with a fucking... 
[01:08:30]  Oh, with the bull.  And he has that fucking ridiculous hat on, and the bull is goring him.  Dude, that's probably the biggest laugh I fucking howled.  That was a good one.  And those movies made me laugh hard, but that was probably the biggest laugh I had.  Yeah.  Can we find that after the story?  Yeah, that's a great one.  He's just trying to get out of the arena, and the bull is just attacking him with a dumb hat.  Or he had balloons on his hand or something?  I don't remember.  Oh, it's great.  He had balloon hands.  Yeah.  And Jim, I spoke to Zachary Hartwell's mother-in-law a short time ago. 
[01:09:00]  She tells me that Zachary and Ryan were two wonderful people, and they'll be sorely missed  on this planet.  I'm live in Westchester, Chad Perdelli, Channel 6, Action News.  Jim.  Thank you, Chad.  What do you mean mother-in-law?  Wasn't that his girlfriend?  What?  No, he said the other guy.  The other guy, Zach Hartwell.  Oh, Zach Hartwell.  I'm sorry.  He, you know, put his foot in their door to try to get a quote.  Yeah, thank God the reporter was knocking on doors in their time of grief.  Thank God. 
[01:09:30]  Did you just give us a word about trying to be all concerned, but he doesn't give a shit.  Yeah.  What could the comment be when somebody in your family like that is killed?  Like, literally, what is the story going to gain other than another piece for their  selfish fucking needs?  But there's no information.  I mean, maybe they could get it.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Maybe it's legit.  Who knows?  This is the Toro Trotter?  Yeah, they had the Toro Trotter.  Toro Trotter.  And they all got propeller heads. 
[01:10:00]  They're all in the fucking seesaws, and the bull is charging them while they're on seesaws.  That bull is so mad.  That dude, as he should be, how would you feel if you had a rope on your testicles,  there was four idiots on a seesaw?  They got giant sucker lollipops for no reason.  Yeah, they just look like morons.  Balloons.  That's Ryan right there, right?  Oh, yeah.  The balloons on his hands.  The hat with the fucking propeller.  Yeah.  And balloons on his hands, though, which I don't know why made me laugh so far.  Balloon hands. 
[01:10:30]  That is so friggin' scary.  Oh, shit.  And he fell off.  Oh, shit.  And now he's running.  And it's just, he's trying to...  Oh, head first.  Oh, my God.  And the fucking bull smashing him into the...  Oh, fuck.  He falls.  He panics and falls, and then the bull smashes him into the door.  And when I was watching that, the balloons on his hand, the fact that he's being smashed  into a fucking wall by a bull...  With balloons.  With balloons tied to his wrist.  God, that made me laugh. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, shit.  So, somebody wrote in, you can see it in that piece, he missed the exit by, like, five feet.  And I guess that was Zachary's exit, is someone saying.  Oh, really?  So, probably at the last second, they were talking to whatever the fuck, and, you know,  I said, yo, dude, this is my exit.  And he just fucking missed it.  God.  You gotta go, ah.  You gotta see the video clip.  I'll miss it.  He missed it by, like, five feet.  He probably thought he could take it by, uh...  Right.  He thought he could do it.  The skid marks are really long, though, you can see.  Instead of just...  And he missed the whole friggin' exit. 
[01:11:30]  People that do that all the time drive me nuts.  It's like, just fucking go around.  Like, you see people stopped on the highway sometimes.  It's like, dude, it's not worth it.  Just go, one extra exit, and come back.  And deal with it.  Yeah, or just...  You're right.  Go to the next exit.  Steve, the therapist, wants to break down the alcohol thing.  We don't know how much he had to drink.  We have no idea if the bar is telling the truth.  We don't know if the bar is telling the truth, if he had a few drinks before that.  We don't even know if he was drunk yet, but the news has no problem reporting he was.  Well, they just say allegedly or reportedly. 
[01:12:00]  Steve, the therapist, go ahead, sir.  Hey, gentlemen, good morning.  Hi.  The body, uh, the average 180-pound man, uh, breaks down about an ounce of alcohol an hour.  Now, you know, in your 12-ounce beer equals an ounce of alcohol.  One shot of, uh, you know, vodka or whatever, 80-proof, is, uh, is an ounce of alcohol.  And, you know, your average...  This is making me want to drink.  Uh, Bobby in North Carolina.  Bobby.  Thank you. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, man.  What's up?  I got to call out Jimmy a little bit for being a little bit of a hypocrite.  Uh, by the way, can I just say, I'll, I'll listen to what you have to say.  People, a lot of times, misuse hypocrite.  Yes, they do.  Although you might not be.  Go ahead.  They do.  Well, you know, I've listened to you for a while, and you've talked about, and this is  just, uh, you know, a societal thing where, you know, you watch the videos of a guy getting  fucked in the ass by a horse, or you'll watch the videos of people getting beheaded, but  you're calling these people out for, uh, stopping by to watch a car crash.  Oh, my God.  I, I, no, let me, maybe I should have, uh, I'm not calling them out for wanting to see 
[01:13:00]  it.  People have morbid curiosity, and it comes out in different ways.  I don't mind.  You're right.  But watching videos, dude, is something that's different, because it's in my house.  I don't go to places, and I don't tie up traffic.  Like, when I see an accident, I really don't slow down.  I take a quick peek as I'm driving.  I don't go down to 20 miles an hour, and I'm honest about being this fucking morbid idiot.  I don't pretend I'm not, and then show up at a crime scene.  I don't go to crime scenes ever, dude.  Jim's thing is different.  I, I certainly slow down on the highway. 
[01:13:30]  I'm guilty of that.  Yeah, no, I hate doing that.  If I was close to that accident scene, I hate to be, I'll, I'll, I would probably, you  know, take a little ride past it.  Yeah, I would, uh.  I would be that guy.  But, but, but watching videos in your own home, it's nothing to do with, uh, uh, people  tying up traffic and actually going, being at the spot.  I'm not trying to marry myself to the story.  Like, I've never tried to, I think it's just a curiosity.  I think it's a curiosity of people, like, similar to you guys, is watching something 
[01:14:00]  that's, you know, morbidly fucking going on, and people just want to watch.  Oh, maybe.  You know what?  Maybe you're right.  You're a hypocrite, dude.  Maybe he's right.  I would have the curiosity to, I guess, punching out.  All right.  I would have the curiosity to go to the accident site, but I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be the  dude on the news, like, trying to make it some poetic thing.  You know, I, I just needed to be here.  I just felt like, I just had to be here.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be that.  I had to.  If I was driving by, maybe I would stop.  I would go, wow.  I would be checking out and going, holy shit. 
[01:14:30]  That's a fucked up shit.  Yeah.  But I've never really done that, though, with crimes, except for, uh, Ground Zero.  I went down there a week, you know, or whatever, after Keith took me through.  That's an extreme example.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I normally don't.  I mean, when I was in Seattle, I had to, uh, I had to drive by Kurt Cobain's house out  of morbid curiosity.  Not, not because he lived there.  It was because he died there.  That's the only reason.  If he, if he was still alive, I wouldn't drive by the fucking guy's house.  Yeah.  I've driven by the Osborne's house. 
[01:15:00]  They don't live there anymore.  Beverly Hills on Doheny.  So it's like, I guess I understand that.  Uh, oh, wow.  Really?  Let's go to Maynard.  Well, Ryan in mass has something on Maynard from, um, tool.  What's up, Ryan?  At Maynard, James Keenan sung it up best in the song, Vicarious.  We all feed on tragedy.  It's like blood to a vampire.  So I mean.  Listen to the words, man.  Listen to the words, man.  Man.  Man. 
[01:15:30]  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  This is going great.  Boo.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Did you see that jerk?  Yeah.  So to speak, literally.  Are you fucking done now?  No, I think that was, uh, that was very justified.  Man.  Maynard didn't sum it up best.  Shut up.  Dust in the wind. 
[01:16:00]  Dust in the wind.  All we are is dust in the wind.  Listen to the words.  You're right, man.  I think Ozzy said it best when he said we're all just going off the rails.  Yeah.  On a crazy train.  On a crazy train, man.  Stop there with my camera phone and snap pictures left and right.  That's all I'm saying.  Right.  What?  What about dead ahead, straight?  Yeah.  You'd be like, all these pictures, one's left, one's right.  I can't see the actual subject.  We're all...  You're a horrid photographer.  We're all just vampires feeding off. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, man.  By the way...  Wait, Ryan, what was the line again?  Because Jimmy has it wrong.  What was it?  Yeah, what was it?  Did you not hear it?  No.  But you know, here's the thing about him.  He said that to...  We're not the first people he said that to.  Yesterday, he quoted that to people, too.  Oh, so many times, too.  Do you ever wonder when you're quoting Maynard lines at a party, when you go, you know,  I think Maynard sums it up, and you watch people uncomfortably turn around and walk  away.  Like, oh, he tweeted it.  Yeah.  You know, he tweeted it. 
[01:17:00]  I'm uncomfortable with this conversation, because I love Tool.  It's not about...  Oh, no.  Dude, anyone...  If he called up and quoted Chuck Berry, I'd want to spit on him.  Yeah.  They have some deep lyrics.  It's not about...  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, there is a season turn, turn, turn.  Yeah.  Man!  A time to live, a time to die, man.  Just, you know, think about the words.  But, Steven, you've been trumped by Jordan today in Scranton.  And allow me to quote from a poet who I think summed it up perfectly. 
[01:17:30]  What?  What?  In the butt.  Why, Bill Tedley?  Yeah.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tedley.  E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tedley.  Yeah, it makes the neck feel good.  Why, Bill Tedley?  Jimmy also scolded me on the way home yesterday, but you don't want to bring that up now, do  you?  I don't remember.  I was singing The Naughty Boy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but Jonathan does that, too.  My manager always screws it up.  He always scolded me, because I go, good boy phone, and then I always say, bad boy phone. 
[01:18:00]  No, no, no, it's Naughty Boy.  It's Naughty.  I go, I know, I make that mistake all the time, and he was bothered.  And a naughty boy.  But I wasn't bothered by the fact that I make the mistake.  Because it makes the cadence different.  He's got a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  Yes.  A naughty.  It raises his throat up.  He says, good boy phone and a bad boy phone.  No.  I understand why people would instinctively do that, because good and bad.  Yeah.  But you yelled at me.  I yelled at my manager for that.  And made me feel very uncomfortable and not worthy. 
[01:18:30]  Well, you know what?  You have to, well, you're a one-phone guy.  I wouldn't expect you to understand that.  He puts his headphones on and cranks his tunes.  That's right.  He was done with me.  Listening to the words.  He was done with me.  The words, man.  It's a naughty boy phone.  You don't say a bad boy's phone and a good boy's.  Because it's not a bad thing.  It's naughty.  It's your behaving saucily.  Hey, are we officially doing the phone call show?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Really? 
[01:19:00]  Damn.  Nice.  Some of those calls are in contention.  For the $5,000?  That's your money, Sam.  How does that make you feel?  With his fucking song lyrics?  They think nothing of giving you a raise, but they'll just throw money away willy-nilly  to a subscriber.  It's not my money.  And my money will be discussed behind the scenes, offline, about...  You know, three months from now?  We'll have conversations, and people are working on it together, conjunctively. 
[01:19:30]  How do you feel with the fact that they just throw money away willy-nilly, and that could  be your raise?  Willy-nilly.  Willy-nilly.  Not to...  They don't even think about it.  They don't?  No, because if you're a good programmer, you would realize a phone show doesn't need a  contest, because people are just excited to be on the radio.  With Steve Sterniolo.  That's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if they throw it away willy-nilly.  I just feel like...  $5,000 to the best phone call during the phone call show? 
[01:20:00]  That's willy-nilly, my friend.  Maybe I'll try to think of a good phone call.  Look it up on Wikipedia.  That's the definition right there for willy-nilly.  But if I try...  I mean, I just try to think of a really good phone call, and maybe then it won't even be  an issue.  Speaking of contests...  I did forget, but John did not, Anthony.  All right.  We're in the middle of our phone call show.  John and Kentucky.  I don't want any part of your house.  Should I win?  Come on. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, God.  What do you got, John?  I'm looking for the tickets, and Anthony has to give away.  Oh!  Don't you have tickets or something, Andy?  Yeah, I know.  How did you get these tickets?  Is this on the up and up?  Yeah.  Trainer gave them to me.  He can't make it.  He goes every year.  He's got tickets to the race.  I think it's...  Is it July 9th?  Someone better check on that.  July 9th is in Kentucky.  No, it's at the Indianapolis Motor Raceway, Speedway there, my friend.  Okay. 
[01:21:00]  It's a NASCAR race.  Oh, it's not the Indy 500?  No, that was just done, remember?  Oh, so NASCAR and Indy isn't as important as Indy 500.  Well, no, but NASCAR fans like watching.  July 31st.  July 31st?  It's on this track.  I mean, who could be sure?  It's on that track.  Is it the Brickyard 400 series?  It might be.  Is there anything...  It's just that one date.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  There's no other dates then?  Because then I guess that's it.  Yeah, then that's it.  Those are the ones I got.  To the best caller on the phone show?  Yeah, how are we going to do this thing?  Look at people.  It's a shitty race.  Fuck you then.  Don't fucking take the tickets.  How about we do the best black joke?  Yeah, how about we don't?  Jimmy's eyes just got really white.  How about we don't?  No?  That's not in the spirit of the phone show.  Oh, it's not?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I apologize.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  There's pit passes and shit.  That's huge.  Nice tickets under the overhang so you're not in the blazing sun.  What?  Yeah, they're pretty good seats from what I heard.  Better be a good-ass phone call.  I don't know what it's got to be, but yeah, it ain't what we've heard.  I'll tell you that much.  So you don't have a...  Like a vampire.  God, that guy was the worst call of the day, by the way.  We've had some bad callers today. 
[01:22:30]  And I can help you out because Pepper913 on Twitter, he's got the one that we should all be quoting.  Yeah?  We built this city on rock and roll.  Ah, we built this city.  Yep.  Always playing corporation games, man.  I bring that up because I didn't forget.  Jimmy hates that song.  It just reminded me, too, of a discussion I had at the Comedy Cellar this weekend with John Joseph.  He's a comedian I know for many years.  Yeah.  He does music in his act.  And we were talking, and he was talking about the Steve Miller band.  And I'm like, they're fucking terrible, dude. 
[01:23:00]  He's like, you don't like it?  You don't like Steve Miller?  No, but they have a lot of very, very big songs, but I just kept thinking.  Abra, Abra, Kadabra.  God, that's fucking unlisted.  I'm going to reach out and grab you.  But you can't defend Steve Miller by bringing up Abra Kadabra.  But what was the other one?  That's why I did that.  What was the other one?  The Joker's Cool.  Yeah, I can't argue with it.  What is this?  This was a massive song for Steve Miller, though.  An MTV.  What song is this?  It was Abra Kadabra.  It was Abra Kadabra.  It stinks.  It stinks.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[01:23:30]  I heat up.  I can't cool down.  You got me spinning round and round.  Everybody, round and round.  Round and round.  Round it goes.  Where it stops.  Nobody knows.  Oh, you don't know.  Yeah, I guess this is just a harmless song, but.  It's pretty harmless.  All right.  Burning flame.  Burning flame.  Big chorus coming up.  Kiss me, baby.  Kiss me, baby. 
[01:24:00]  The whip in there.  80s.  Fucking blows.  82.  He's 82?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  God.  This is a time between Martha Quinn and fucking J.J. Johnson would play on MTV when I was waiting  for my fucking live Children of the Grave to play this fucking horrible song.  What other ones do they have?  Well, what did the guy bring up?  Fly Like an Eagle is a big one.  That was one.  Another one I think is horrendous.  I like Fly Like a Eagle.  Take the Money and Run.  Big old Jet Air Liner. 
[01:24:30]  I like Jet Air Liner.  I haven't thought of this band in a while.  Jungle Love was a big hit.  Jungle Love is all right.  Who's Jungle Love?  Although I only made it to 17.  Is this the greatest hits in?  Yeah.  Rocking Me.  Rocking Me was a great song.  Keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping.  How about Take the Money and Run?  Come on.  Take the Money and Run.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Then it gets ugly after Abracadabra.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Number 57, 60, 57.  Boy, you never made it back into the top 50.  I just don't like this song.  How about Keep on Rocking Me, Baby?  Ugh.  Keep on Rocking Me, Baby.  Swingtown.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  My arm.  Why does it bother you so much?  This isn't that bad.  No, it's just, it's everything that annoys me.  This is like what's considered.  It's kind of pop rock.  That's all.  It's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptable type shit.  This was known that it was pop in the 70s and 80s. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  It's harmless.  It just annoys me.  I just find it, uh, Space Cowboy.  Thank you, Seth.  Almost forgot about that one.  Did you say Space Cowboy?  It's getting real hard and I'm trying to find a job.  And it just goes on my job for every day.  This is, I guess, uh, it's not hurting anyone.  Nah, when you hear them, it's like, I don't hate it, but I'm just like, I guess it just kind of stinks.  I agree with you as far as we built this city.  That's not them, though. 
[01:26:00]  That's Jefferson Airplane, right?  One of the Jeffersons.  Starship.  Starship.  Jefferson Airplane.  That's a bad song.  Starship.  Then it was just Starship, I think.  Starship.  We built this city on Rock and Roll.  Jefferson Biplane.  Jefferson Dirigible.  Like, we get it.  You got these airship thing.  Build this.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  You know, we gotta play that.  I love that.  That's great.  My dick's all shitty song. 
[01:26:30]  Is this the one with the local traffic report?  Yes.  Listen to the beat.  We'll do the local traffic report for your city.  God, this fucking stinks.  It is.  Huge hit for them.  Oh, my God.  Ugh!  Ugh.  Say you don't care who goes.  My dick's all shitty.  That's all I think of now when I hear this song.  They're knee deep in the hoopla.  They're knee deep in the hoopla.  What? 
[01:27:00]  Too many runaways.  What are they doing?  Eating up.  Yeah!  My Tony plays the bomb bomb.  That is horrible.  Listen to the radio.  Don't you remember?  We built this shitty.  Oh.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty. 
[01:27:30]  How can you feel this shitty?  All these 80s children.  Look at that mullet.  I know we do the same fucking break over and over again.  But I have to say it again.  What makes my dick so shitty so great is the passion behind the vocalist.  Yeah.  He's so passionate.  Oh, he is.  About the words.  This 80s video where they just shoot the face.  How far would you say above the head?  The camera's like maybe a foot above the head and the guy's looking up into the camera.  Yes.  That was a style.  Very whimsical. 
[01:28:00]  That was such an 80s style.  It's terrible.  Ugh.  And then this old housewife.  Grace Slick.  Grace Slick.  With an awful Vegas video.  Yeah.  Great.  This is like Aces High.  Aces High.  Her fucking horrible outfit.  I could make an entire video out of this stock footage.  Oh, this is fucking terrible.  Oh, God.  She looks like fucking Tim Curry in Rocky Horror Show. 
[01:28:30]  Rocky Horror.  Frankenfurter.  We built this city on rock and roll.  Why does this song make me angry?  It's infuriating.  We got an idea for your contest that you haven't figured out yet.  Yeah.  For the indie tickets.  The winner has to take Bobo, who's a huge NASCAR fan.  Yeah.  Oh.  He's a huge NASCAR fan.  But he's got to drive him to Indianapolis.  Oh, they got to come and get him?  What if they live, like, in Indianapolis?  We got to pick him up. 
[01:29:00]  We can make a local contest.  I have to stop and go to the bathroom.  Could you stop my bladders?  I had a lot of operations.  Could I bring Mr. Balloonigans?  Mr. Balloonigans is coming, too.  He has to.  No one's there to feed him.  Fuck you.  Who wants to take a bet today?  Yeah.  Who wants to take a bet?  What's the bet?  You might take the bet after you hear the bet.  What's the bet?  I will guarantee, and I will put 100 beaners on the line. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, wow.  The $100 that I put aside for E-Rock for his 20 push-ups.  I still have that $100.  Oh, God.  That you, my friend.  Me.  Will be getting a phone call today from one of the cute guys.  Yeah.  And I don't mean cute in that way.  Oh, I know what you mean.  Relax.  Yeah.  And he's going to say, we now officially need contest rules for your silly little fucking  tickets.  Exactly.  I was thinking that last night.  How much do you want to bet?  I'm not going to bet. 
[01:30:00]  Damn it.  Because I was thinking the same thing last night.  Damn it.  Take the bet.  When I saw the tickets, they're sitting on my little night table at home, and I looked  at them and thought, yeah, we ought to get these.  And then all I was thinking is, who am I kidding?  How much do you want to bet?  Give them away.  It's going to be a big budel, as they call it.  That's fucking Sterniolio, whatever his Italian, how it's Stern name is.  But he's going to go, look.  It's a big budel, Robin.  Look, man, we don't have a problem with you giving away the tickets.  No, no, it's fine.  But we do need rules.  But just give me a few days, because now we need rules. 
[01:30:30]  We have to run this through legal and rule, and I'll be like, you know what I'm going  to do?  I'm going to go on the street.  We've got to post the rules on the internet.  I'll just go on the street and hand someone to go, here, go to this.  And then we've got to let the rules bake a little bit before we blue sky the contest.  But we kicked it upstairs, and legal's going over it.  Yeah, there's no problems.  We just need a few days.  It's actually a good idea.  Oh, God.  Instead of some spontaneous, look, I got these fucking tickets.  Yeah, we just want to be indemnified if a tire flies off the car and smashes the head 
[01:31:00]  of the person that got the tickets.  We want total indemnification.  Right.  But in indemnifying ourselves, of course, we want the cost put on you.  You're not taking the bet?  No.  Fuck.  I completely expect that.  E-Rock, 20 push-ups for 100 bucks?  You in today?  Yeah.  I'm good.  What?  I'm good.  You're still good.  Oh, I thought you were good with doing it.  This is ridiculous.  Eh, I'm fine.  Yeah?  You don't have a day.  Did you train a little? 
[01:31:30]  How about for 18 push-ups?  18.  You're going to give him $100 for 18 push-ups?  Two less push-ups.  Two less push-ups today, sir.  Wow.  Nah, I'm fine.  You've got to be kidding me!  And I actually have 100 beaners right in my fucking wallet.  He's got it.  And I got it today.  Damn, yo.  You're not going to do 18 push-ups?  18 push-ups for $100.  Who wouldn't do that?  You're a dick.  And you got 100 beaners?  Gumbelina.  Perhaps more than that.  Oh, don't show me.  I don't even know what I got.  Don't show me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, holy shit. 
[01:32:00]  How did you get all that?  What is wrong with you?  Anthony always carries a lot of money.  Don't say that.  I don't care.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Oh, good point.  Come on.  Bring it, motherfucker.  By the way, on the way home from your house, I had a fucking road rage argument with a  guy who jumped out of his truck.  It was like, he was just drunk or whatever.  He actually jumped out of the truck.  But he was a fat pig.  To find you a little bit?  It was, it was.  What did he jump?  What was the situation?  I pulled up.  This is, by the way, this is why I should never carry.  I pulled up. 
[01:32:30]  I was waiting.  I came through the Midtown Tunnel back into Manhattan.  It's like four in the morning.  And I'm waiting to make a left.  I'm kind of in two lanes.  But I have my, I'm listening to show tunes on my fucking thing.  I'm listening to the fucking nut.  Someone had the itch.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm trying to make it.  Don't make it.  Turn it off.  I'm about to make a left and this van pulls up.  And I hear him.  He goes, wait, you need two fucking lanes?  And I was like, I wasn't even mad.  I was like, what?  He goes, you got two fucking lanes? 
[01:33:00]  I'm like, what?  And he goes, I need two fucking lanes.  I'm like, I heard you.  You pulled the gag on him.  But I was like, it was almost surprising.  Like, it was so irrational.  And he was a big fat fuck.  It wasn't like he was this fucking young.  And, uh.  No, you were stopped at a light.  Yeah.  But I'm like, well, I'm making a left.  He goes, well, I'm going to go first.  I'm like, go ahead.  I was, it was almost like it was, he was such a cunt that it wasn't even annoying.  And I didn't feel threatened by him.  He was just a fat fuck. 
[01:33:30]  And he goes, don't argue.  So he makes the left.  And then we have to make a right on Second Avenue.  And I'm looking at him.  And he jumps out of his van.  I go, you fucking cunt.  What the fuck?  And then he just gets back in his van.  And then, uh.  And I was.  But I wasn't even angry.  I was like, what a douche.  Like, but I get scared because when the anger hits me a minute later.  Like, it just.  It just like.  I'm like, I want to take my car and crush him against his van.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like an irrational rage. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And it's like, that's why I just can't ever carry.  You know, you do it in new.  If someone has a new car and they're really.  He had an old van.  It goes, oh, this is a BMW.  But then he makes it.  Oh, Mr. Jealousy.  Just.  It was such a non.  It was surprising.  Because we.  It wasn't like we were driving and he cut me off or I cut him off.  Um.  I've done this move, which is great.  If someone has a car.  Doesn't even have to be new.  Just a car you know they care about a little bit.  Yeah.  More work vans, don't even worry about it.  This doesn't work. 
[01:34:30]  But when you get in an argument with somebody, you pull up next to them.  Right.  On their right hand side.  You pull up next to them.  You give them the look.  The second the light turns green.  You open your door and smash the fucking side of their car.  You've done this?  Oh, yeah.  And then you just shut it and you take off and you're gone.  No one's driving faster than me.  I know how to fucking weave around.  You've done that?  And left a giant fucking ding in his fuck car.  You're insane.  Because he's been a cocksucker to me. 
[01:35:00]  Fuck you.  Bam.  Gone.  I love that you're getting more and more insane.  Have you done that recently?  This is becoming fun.  Not recently.  No, no.  It's very rare that I get the opportunity.  Because you have to have somebody that kind of cares about the car.  You've got to be next to them.  You have to have had an altercation.  But when that shit.  I have like things for every situation.  Every situation I have a little thing.  Cabs, I don't mind just running into.  I run into cabs now.  I hit their bumper.  I push them into intersections.  I hate them.  But I'm like, that's how you. 
[01:35:30]  But it's like in moments like that.  It's like where this fat guy jumps out of his.  And I really was.  It was.  He wasn't threatening.  He was a big fat fuck.  What did he get out for?  Again, that's what I'm saying.  It was irrational.  It wasn't like.  Yeah.  We had this.  He was just a fucking.  He's the type of guy that like afterwards.  I was like, how good would it feel to literally gun it and crush his body against it?  But I'm like, that's how you wound it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's like in that one moment.  You can almost feel.  That you want to do it.  Like your hand's turning the wheel. 
[01:36:00]  You just got to yell at you.  You go, get back.  Back in your car.  You fat fuck.  Get back in your fucking car.  But that's how I fucking deal with those cocksuckers.  That's how in a one moment thing.  You can absolutely change the course of your life.  I am.  That's a crossroad.  Dude, that's a life's fork.  It really is the type of thing where you can go to prison for a year or at least be charged  with vehicular assault or whatever.  Like, let's just say I did that.  Let's say that momentary rage hit me because he made a right right after that. 
[01:36:30]  Like he jumped back in his car and then he made a right onto a side street.  I don't know if he wanted me to stop or whatever, but it was the rage.  Like, I just like, I'm so glad that I didn't steer my car into his thing.  But if I had what you have, if I carried, this is why you're qualified and I'm not.  I know what I would have done.  I know I would have pulled it.  No, I never would do anything like that.  I know you wouldn't.  I know you wouldn't.  I would.  And that's why I'm not qualified.  I yell at people.  That's all I do.  I would so pull.  Or put dings in their door. 
[01:37:00]  Yes?  My favorite story you used to tell was that when someone would piss you off on the road,  you used to have an ashtray full of change and you'd huck it into their open window.  Yeah, yeah.  I would throw it at their open window, like pennies and nickels and stuff like that,  and just be like, wham!  And then for a while we had golf balls in the vehicle.  I used to do it with golf balls.  Golf balls would make a great dent in a car.  You'd throw a golf ball, you'd just hear, dung!  And you'd just know there's a big pit right in this fucking car.  A few people took a golf ball to the side of their car between here and Rochester.  Those long trips. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then I realized that's completely insane.  Of course.  And I had to stop it.  Love it.  You can't do that because if they...  Because those fucking golf balls will bounce forever when they leave your car at 70 miles  an hour.  But if you hurt somebody like that, it's a lawsuit.  No, I know.  I was a lot younger.  I was stupid.  I was even more stupid.  That was back in the day.  I understand.  Hey, did you show your anger the other night, Jimmy, to this guy?  Yes and no.  See, that's what he wanted.  You should have.  I literally wasn't that...  It was more... 
[01:38:00]  It wasn't that I was so angry.  Because I didn't care that much.  It was more like...  I don't know the feeling.  He wasn't a frightening guy, so maybe it wasn't an intimidating situation.  It was just like, you fucking fat...  Like...  I was just thinking you could have done something differently.  Like what?  Sang the Bill Tetley theme song.  Oh.  That would have drove him nuts.  I did have a cabbie recently with a rage incident where I was coming on 23rd Street.  And he disarmed me. 
[01:38:30]  He disarmed me.  Because I pulled up behind him.  And he stopped in the left lane of 23rd Street.  And I fucking whirled on the horn.  And I pulled up next to him.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And I'm screaming.  And he rolls his window down.  He goes, what?  I tried to make a living.  You're beeping.  And I'm like...  I don't know why.  I just wasn't mad anymore.  I'm like, but dude, you stopped in the street.  He goes, you're wrong.  I know.  I shouldn't stop.  I tried to make a living.  You're beeping. 
[01:39:00]  You make me upset.  And I'm like, yeah, whatever.  Go make a living then.  I'm like, just put your thing on.  You're flashers.  Yeah, something.  Could you give me some indication of what the fuck you're doing?  That's the one I love.  When they just do that...  I'm not taking any bet.  What?  Oh, I thought the bet was...  The E-Rock bet.  Oh, the E-Rock bet?  I thought you were in on the E-Rock bet.  18 push-ups?  I'm down to 18 push-ups.  I'll do it.  $100.  I got it right here.  I think he can do it, though.  I think he can do it.  But of course he can.  He's just lazy.  18 push-ups for $100.  Nah, I'm good. 
[01:39:30]  Thank you, though.  That's insane.  What the fuck?  It's a quick hundred.  He's fucking like, just...  He's laughing.  It's the way the E-Rock laughs.  How much money do you have in your pocket?  It must be nice to be independently.  Wealthy, E-Rock.  I don't know.  Got a couple grand.  Oh, my God.  You want to add a little to this?  Fuck for E-Rock?  No way.  Uh-huh.  How about...  I only had a 20.  No, how about this?  $120 for 18 push-ups?  Yeah.  How about if you get to 18, $10 a push-up. 
[01:40:00]  So, $180.  Oh, my God.  And I got it.  I don't even need it.  $10 a push-up?  Oh, my God.  I don't even need it.  I got it right here.  I don't even need it.  $10 a push-up?  Oh, he's got so much.  Look at this.  That's crazy.  Look, is that $180 right there in 20s?  I see it.  Certainly is.  But if you fall short, you get nothing.  But you get to fucking 18, $180.  That's all right.  And $10 for every push-up you do after 18.  Oh, my God.  Why isn't he doing this? 
[01:40:30]  Because he's a big, fat, rich kid.  That's why I'm pretty cool, huh?  Yeah.  Is that open for all the show members?  No.  Go get Sturney-Ola, because I want to drive him nuts today.  Get Sturney-Ola.  Hey, me and Sturney-Ola, we used to come down here.  What's that?  Sturney-Ola.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Sturney-Ola showed me.  Yeah, it's a donkey show.  Sturney-Ola.  Greatest last name ever. 
[01:41:00]  I got to get off at that train station when I come from the city.  Next stop, Sturney-Ola.  Sturney-Ola.  Is that on the way to, what was it again?  I already forgot.  Yarn City?  No, that's leaving Yarn City.  That's on the way to Paradise.  Oh, that's right.  Paradise Island.  Hey, by the way, did anyone get my Robert Kelly tweet last night?  We're joking with each other at the cellar.  And he goes, yeah, what are you typing it out in Morris Code?  Did he say Morris Code, dude?  Morris Code.  What is that?  Fucking cats understand it?  I'm like, that's how you secretly communicate with Jews. 
[01:41:30]  The Morris Code?  Morris Code.  I immediately threatened to Twitter it.  He begged me not to.  So, of course, I did.  Oh, that's great.  Of course, I did.  Morris Code, dude.  You got your Morris Code.  Oh, wait.  Well, Sam's running back for some reason.  Is he in the middle of his phone show?  He's actually doing funny in the morning this morning.  Funny in the morning?  It's Sonny Fox's show.  It's just the opposite of what we're doing.  Yeah.  He wanted me to relay.  No, he said he'd be fired if he comes in here. 
[01:42:00]  Why?  Because he's actually on the morning show.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Is he talking?  Yeah, he's like the producer slash co-host.  So can he do a couple minutes with us?  He's a bum.  What time is that show over?  I think 11.  But he wanted me to relay a message.  What?  Eric is a tub of goo and a bucket of shit.  Wow.  That's from Sterniolo.  That's not me.  But you couldn't wait to come in here and tell everyone.  Oh, it's timing.  Radio's timing.  Good point.  He's not going to do it for $180?  What are you made of, Sam? 
[01:42:30]  What do you mean what am I made of?  You're at a crossroad.  Is Eric not doing the push-ups for $180?  You're at a yield sign right now.  What are you going to do?  $180 and he ain't fucking doing this?  That's insane.  Plus $10 for every fucking push-up he does after 18.  Oh, my God.  He could walk out of here.  Crazy.  $300?  Yeah.  Crazy.  I think the average...  Are you 30 yet, E-Rock?  Oh, you're over 30.  I think any 30-year-old could do 30 push-ups.  Especially with $300 on the line?  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:43:00]  What a...  E-Rock?  No, I'm all right.  E-Rock?  Oh, my...  I'm all right.  Troy's flipping out in there, rolling his flipping ass.  Get Troy in here.  Because everybody is like, I would do that in a second for that kind of money.  This goes past like I don't...  Oh, my God.  This is a no-brainer for anybody else.  It's a no-brainer.  Oh.  What, is this beneath you to walk away with at least $180?  Think of it as gas for your boat.  I don't have the boat.  Troy's with pee-pee.  I is?  Think of the boat. 
[01:43:30]  Troy.  I see, Troy.  He's not happy.  Troy, can you believe this fucking guy won't do this for that much money?  Oh, by the way, and if E-Rock is trying to play me, this is my final offer.  I'm not fucking going to keep going up.  Oh, shit.  This is a great offer.  An extra $10 for every push-up above $18.  So if he did 30 push-ups, he'd get $300.  If he gets to $18, he gets to $180.  $10 a push-up.  And then any push-up after $18, yes.  I'll just keep adding $10.  I'll throw the $10 down as he's pumping them out. 
[01:44:00]  It's beyond frustrating.  Because he doesn't need it.  It's just such a, fuck you.  I don't need it.  I make enough money.  I don't need your money.  You know, last week, I made him feel guilty when he didn't do the 26 push-ups.  And I made him take me out to lunch.  He spent $110 on a Thursday lunch.  Like, it was nothing.  And he still doesn't need the $300.  Would you take that bet, Troy, just to make some extra money?  You'd take that bet.  What the fuck, yeah.  I'd be sitting here doing push-ups until the afternoon.  But we know you could do them. 
[01:44:30]  B-Rock, do you want to do it for the cash?  No, I'm all right.  Thank you.  You're insane.  You don't need the money?  Why are you all right?  At least explain.  Well, you know, there's people who need that money more than I need it.  But no one's getting the bet.  It's not open to anybody else.  That's not my fault that they weren't at it.  It's not my fault that everyone else can't do push-ups.  No, but then you can't.  Or I can't do push-ups.  See, I'm not offering it to anyone else.  And if you care about other people and your fellow employees, you would do it because it's  an easy bet.  And you get at least $180.  Then you could dish it out to the guys that desperately need it. 
[01:45:00]  There you go.  Great idea.  I just spun that shit in your face.  Life at a party.  Or you could at least buy lunch for everybody.  That's right.  Lazy slob is coming in.  Fucking entitled rich kid.  I'll coach you, Eric.  I'm just reading things.  Are you a rich kid, E-Rog?  No.  Let me coach you for $180.  He comes from money.  I've seen his house in Long Island.  You have?  I have.  I've been to his parents' house.  How big is it?  Big?  It's nice.  He grew up in a nice house.  I think he grew up in Florida.  No.  Yes, he did. 
[01:45:30]  Sam started that shit when he came on board that I'm from Florida.  That is a rumor I started.  Well, your family's down in Florida.  Okay.  His heart is in Florida.  Yeah.  His heart is in Florida.  Sam started that shit.  I did start that rumor.  Troy, you're mad, huh?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Beyond mad.  He doesn't need the money, so then he should just do it for the staff at this point.  Fuck him.  He's the heir to the Nagel family fortune.  Yeah.  Wow.  People are pissed.  I mean, just everything.  Just everything from coming from money to winning the lottery to being grossly overpaid. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  I mean, it's all just.  I thought you were going to say something.  I'm not dropping it lower than 18 push-ups.  Eric, we know.  Because this has to be interesting.  It's going to be close if he could even do 18.  We know I'm in a rough spot over the past two days, now more than ever.  Just do the push-ups and give me the 180.  You got a $110 lunch over there.  You're fine.  Oh.  Well, that was Roland's lunch, too, by the way, and I think that that definitely contributed 
[01:46:30]  to the $110.  Eric, can I just ask you something?  Sure.  Do you think you can do that many push-ups?  You did 20 at the physical fitness challenge.  Yeah, but that's all I had to do.  You only have to do 18 now.  I don't have to do shit.  Oh, my God.  But if you do 30, you walk away with 300 bucks.  Oh, fuck.  This fucking guy sucks.  He doesn't understand what he's doing to himself.  It's annoying, right?  Oh, beyond annoying.  Because he just doesn't care.  It's just like, fuck you. 
[01:47:00]  I don't need your money.  Eric, you could take the money and use it to buy a plane ticket back home.  You've done worse for...  I'm from New York, Florida.  You're not from New York.  Stop telling people that.  Where are your license plates from?  Jersey now.  No.  You're from Florida, Eric.  You're a Florida resident.  And he's done worse for free on the show.  Of course he has.  He's an idiot.  He's a fucking thing of mayo for nothing.  Yeah, but just eating and vomiting doesn't actually require physical strength.  Do you hate his lack of physical prowess?  Oh, it just annoys me beyond... 
[01:47:30]  Just because he's just going to be in a world of shit as he gets older.  And he's just getting bigger and lazier.  You hate his lazy lumpiness?  Yeah.  His lackadaisical attitude?  He just eats shitty food, and it just always has to put chemicals in his water.  You know he doesn't drink water, right?  What are you talking about?  He never drinks water.  What is it?  What's his chemicals?  He always needs a treat.  Yes!  I told you how indulgent he is.  Yes!  He airy with his water? 
[01:48:00]  Eric believes that he lives a difficult lifestyle, and so he gets to work, and he'd like to treat  himself, even if it's just to have a water in the morning.  This is not a treat.  It's caffeine.  He needs a treat, and so he takes a little powdered iced tea and sprinkles it in his water.  You think he likes treats?  He needs a treat everywhere he goes.  Instead of just drinking water.  No, because it's not a treat.  It's no taste.  It's boring.  Yeah.  Everything that goes in his mouth has to be a treat of some sort.  It has to be a treat, yeah.  It can't just be sustenance.  Oh, shit. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, shit.  There it is.  Danny just dropped off the treats.  Danny just came in with a handful of his water treats.  Iced tea.  Natural lemon.  Because you know it's natural when it's in a small powdered pouch.  Yeah, let me see one of those.  That's how natural lemons...  Crystal light.  This is all ascertain.  Crystal light.  See, Lipton.  This is how you know he needs a treat with his water?  Chetley.  He's got a pouch of half and half, half iced tea, half lemonade. 
[01:49:00]  That's a treat.  That's someone...  But he earned it.  He earned it.  When you want a treat...  I bought it.  If it's a nice day and you want to treat yourself, you get half iced tea, half lemonade.  What are you drinking right now?  This is two servings.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  He puts the whole thing in one.  It says two servings.  What are you...  Irock, what are you drinking at the other...  All I'm having.  This one is...  Oh, from this one?  Yeah.  This one is lemonade iced tea.  You're drinking a giant lemonade iced tea?  And what's in the bottle?  What's in the bottle is Lipton's iced tea. 
[01:49:30]  Why the iced tea?  Why not just some water?  Because I don't drink coffee and, you know, I try to...  I used to drink and I kind of still do a lot of soda.  I'm trying to get rid of that.  How about just water?  Just water, Eric.  I do, but in the morning I drink the iced tea.  Who gives a fuck?  Troy hates...  Who am I bothering?  I hate me.  Me.  Troy hates your weakness.  That's what it is.  It's a weakness.  It is.  And he hates it.  It is.  It's just like show some self-control, show some strength, some willpower.  And do 18 push-ups for 180 bucks.  To eat well, to take care of your body, because you're just going to pay for it later, dude. 
[01:50:00]  Well, you know why?  That's not Eric's viewpoint of pay for it later.  He's not a long-term thinker.  He's an immediate, short-term, what's in it for me right now?  Where does the treat come in?  Instant gratification.  Instant treats.  What's the reward?  Yeah.  It's all about instant treats.  Treats and sweetness and goodies.  Yeah.  If I do this, what is the treat that I get immediately following?  So, E-Rock, can I add a treat to the bed?  Oh.  Maybe I pay you in treats instead of actual cash. 
[01:50:30]  Money's not money.  Maybe that's what's confusing him.  He can buy treats with the money, but maybe I have to actually pay him in treats.  How about a coffee cake?  Drake's coffee cake.  Fuck, I'd do something for that.  I know.  It's great.  Love coffee cake.  E-Rock?  Not a million.  Not into that.  No.  Never say.  Yodel?  I mean, with his money, he could buy whatever he wants.  Yeah.  It just doesn't make sense.  Somebody's Twitter here.  E-Rock is a fat whale fuck who deserves to be fired or burned alive.  I hate him more than anyone.  E-Rock, question. 
[01:51:00]  Danny shouldn't be tweeting.  Here's a question.  Here's a question for you, E-Rock.  Fuck the money.  Fuck doing push-ups.  Everything like that.  Oh, my God.  If you had $180 just out of nowhere, what would you get with it?  What treat?  Not even a treat.  Just something.  What would you buy with $180 extra dollars that no one else has a say on what you can  get?  What would you get?  And you should add that it's pocket money.  He likes the sound of pocket money. 
[01:51:30]  That's what he calls it.  That's what he calls it.  It's just something.  It's $180.  Get whatever you want.  What do you think?  What pops in your head that you would want?  I'll tell you if he's lying.  Toys.  I know exactly where he'd go first.  Oh, really?  Yes.  All right.  Well.  He'd go to Toys R Us with the money.  A hundred percent.  Yes.  And he'll buy wrestling action figures.  And he'd pretend the toys were for his nephew when they're not.  All right.  So, Iroch, would you get some toys?  Would you buy some toys?  That's not the first place.  That might be the second place, but that's not the first place.  Do you think that a lot of times Iroch was getting anything signed for charity that  he was tucking away just in case? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Never.  Yes.  A hundred percent.  I'm only asking Sam, Iroch.  A hundred percent I do.  And now he doesn't have the charity auction, so he pretends it's for family members.  Family.  Yeah.  So where would the first place you go?  Where would that be?  Probably Best Buy.  Best Buy.  And you get yourself what?  Something that he can just watch while sitting on the couch slovenly and drinking soda pop  and eating ice cream.  With my blackout curtains and the air conditioning on.  Yeah.  I mean, just listen to that lifestyle. 
[01:52:30]  He goes home.  He closes the curtains.  He puts on TV.  He puts on the air conditioning.  And he makes Coke floats.  His sedentary lives.  He sits there making Coke floats.  What's a Coke float?  It's when you put your vanilla ice cream in with your Coca-Cola and you mix them together  and he drinks that while waiting.  Does he actually drink that?  No, he does not.  Yes, he does.  They're delicious.  And he just sits there waiting for his wife to come home watching a cartoon on Blu-ray.  Do you watch cartoons on Blu-ray?  Sometimes.  Wait. 
[01:53:00]  You bought Blu-ray cartoons?  Do you want to know what happened yesterday?  You're an adult baby.  Wait.  You bought Blu-ray cartoons?  Animated series, Jim.  Like what?  Well, let's see.  Yesterday, my wife came home from work and I was sleeping with the Transformers movie  playing on Blu-ray.  What time of the day was this?  8.  8.15.  And he's sleeping.  And then he wonders why he has sleep problems because he slept the whole day.  And then he wakes up when she gets home.  So what's going to make you want to go to bed at 10 o'clock at a reasonable hour to 
[01:53:30]  get up here and get in on time?  Troy wants to slap Eric in the face.  Oh, my God.  It's just one fucking thing after another.  What do you mean?  He gets mad because I don't go out and skateboard every day like he does.  Oh!  Don't have a cow.  So you're going to be mad at me for doing something physical.  No, I'm not mad at you.  I don't give a shit.  No, you do something physical.  I care everything about what I do.  Yeah, you don't do anything physical.  Just say you love me and get over with it.  I do love you.  No!  Look, I love you as a person, but you have a lot of shitty habits and they're disgusting. 
[01:54:00]  Troy thinks that when Erick gets here and he's tired and says he didn't sleep  well, it's because he goes home and participates in activities where one could literally pass  out while they're doing it every day.  Like, the things Troy does when he's active, he's learning, it's not things you could just  fall asleep.  When you're just sitting on the couch, playing Xbox, watching cartoons, drinking Coke floats.  Eating.  Consuming.  Putting inside of you. 
[01:54:30]  Wait, do you think Erick knows how to tell himself no?  No!  He's never been told.  His parents never told him no, so it was just like, here, here.  Oh, shit, little spoiled-y rock you're saying?  Do you think he's spoiled?  The meat dinner?  Of course.  Absolutely.  How about the meat dinner?  The what?  The meat dinner?  Meat dinner?  What's a meat dinner?  Roland's bringing things up again.  Remember with your dad, the meat dinner?  Oh.  What's a meat dinner?  Well, you went to the Brazilian restaurant.  Oh, Plataforma.  Yeah.  I love that.  That's the best, dude.  I'm 46.  Carve off meat. 
[01:55:00]  Just eating meat.  Holy shit, is Plataforma good?  Yeah.  That's great.  Would they have to use a machete with you there?  Oh, yeah.  It was myself, Roland, and his brother.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  They must have been petrified when they walked in.  Like, oh, boy.  Started crying.  Here it comes.  Jesus, Roland.  They don't charge you per piece of meat, though.  No.  No.  He goes, I hope not.  I hope not.  Maybe if you put the $180 in terms of goodies, like, in terms of how many 12 packs of Diet 
[01:55:30]  Cherry Coke you could get.  Oh, wow.  Or how many Blu-rays you can get.  Like, say a Blu-ray's $20.  If you do 20 push-ups, Eric, you could get 10 Blu-rays.  You know what I would do if I was here?  Wow.  I would come in here.  I would push out 30.  I'd grab the money.  I would look at me and go, fuck you, and walk out.  Exactly.  That's like, yeah.  And then it shuts everyone down.  Probably because any other thing I've done before is to shut everybody else down, and this  still goes on.  You should never do what you do.  You said you shut anyone down. 
[01:56:00]  When did you?  When was the last time you shut anyone down?  You should do 30 push-ups.  You gave up while you were running.  Wait, Troy.  I didn't have to.  I already won.  What were you going to say?  No.  You say you're going to lose weight for the show.  I'm on this diet.  And then you don't do it, and you look like an asshole.  Everything you've ever promised to get done for this show hasn't happened.  When did I?  No, no, no.  I don't promise shit for this show.  It's, hey, Iraq, you really should do this.  Everyone's going to love it.  You bet on it.  You can shut them down.  Everybody will shut up.  Fuck, I'll go do it.  And then what happens? 
[01:56:30]  The next thing comes up that you need to shut everybody else up.  You don't shut anyone down.  You bet with Dr. Ian Smith, and you lost.  And then you spent his money anyway.  Dr. Ian's an ass.  Not my fault.  Yeah.  He is an ass.  Not my fault.  He got pissed off.  He left.  He didn't come back for three or four years.  And you spent the money because there was money there, and you could get some treats  for yourself.  I did not spend it on treats.  But that happens all the time, where you say you're going to do things.  You say, I'm going to man up.  I'm going to lose this weight.  I'm going to show you guys.  I'm going to show you guys, and you don't do it, and you look like the asshole. 
[01:57:00]  Here's the lesson.  Stop asking me to do shit, and then you don't get mad at me for it.  Leave me alone, and then you don't get pissed off.  Your mic is too loud.  Of course it is.  He's controlling that shit.  C-Rock, why is your mic so loud?  Too loud.  So, Troy, were you spoiled growing up?  No, not at all.  What were your parents?  Middle class?  Middle class.  And they said, I wanted a car when I turned 16, and they said, you need to get a job.  So I started dishwashing at 15.  So what bothers you is the concept of somebody who might be a little portly and has things  handed to them.  Yes.  Yes, and it's just always has to consume. 
[01:57:30]  Always has to consume everything and eat.  You're so fucking counterculture, okay?  Oh, man, what is that about?  It's counterculture because he had a job when you consume materialistic shit, man.  It's eating.  He didn't call you materialistic.  He said you consume everything in science.  E-Rock, you know, in all fairness, E-Rock is America.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  E-Rock is America. 
[01:58:00]  Good for you.  And you're going to run into a lot of fun.  Troy's a hipster.  But wait, why do you think that he's counterculture because you consume?  No, because every time...  Why do you do that, man?  Why do you do that to yourself?  Like, he won't watch fucking movies if I try to talk to him.  No, I got rid of my TV.  I got rid of my cable.  I don't do those things.  Everything I do is a problem to him.  Thundercats.  So stop paying attention to what I do.  When you got rid of your TV?  No, I still have my TV.  I turn off my cable, though, because I don't really watch TV that much.  So what do you watch? 
[01:58:30]  Nothing.  Oh, you are a hipster.  Okay, that is...  Eric's consumerism really bugs E-Rock.  E-Rock does raise a good point, though.  Just stop watching what I do.  But when that laziness comes into your work ethic every day...  Oh, now he's talking about your work ethic, not personal life.  Wow.  But it just...  Wow.  When it goes into that...  You saw this cover.  E-Rock's just sitting there on this one?  I've been friends with Eric for a long time, and he is going to run into a lot of complications 
[01:59:00]  if he doesn't make some life changes right now.  As things get older, as he gets bigger, as he gets lazier, it's harder to drop the weight.  It's harder to get healthy.  I don't think you care about that, though.  Like, a meaning that I think it just bugs you on principle.  I think that, like...  We know that you could run into health problems, but I think E-Rock just bugs him on principle.  Like, the health problems are legit, but that's not the core of your being annoyed.  But I don't hate Eric.  I like Eric as a person.  I really do.  But you wouldn't care if he got the diabetes. 
[01:59:30]  If he does, he brought it on himself.  Oh, man.  Well, he's still going to his personal trainer.  Is he?  Is he?  No.  Exactly.  That cuts into Transformer time.  Oh, shit.  Do you hate that he watches Blu-ray cartoons?  I mean, he's a fucking adult.  Like, what are you doing, dude?  Like, what are you sitting around watching cartoons for as an adult?  Well, Dennis D. in Jersey says...  Thanks, Grandpa.  Eric's two greatest fears in life, expectations, and gym equipment.  Is that true?  Oh, man.  That's not right. 
[02:00:00]  So, wait.  Why did you call him Grandpa?  Because that's the shit an old person would say.  You're sitting around watching cartoons.  But, you know, I got told that at 13.  You're a 33-year-old man.  Who gives a fuck?  Like, you're not a kid.  Like, you sit around with your wrestling figures.  Again, why is this bothering you?  You know what I mean?  Seriously, like, why doesn't anybody else think that's fucking weird?  You know?  Really?  You're an adult and you're skateboarding in the park.  Do you think he has matches with his wrestling figures?  I guarantee you that.  He sits there and plays with them while they're wrestling on TV. 
[02:00:30]  Do you do that?  Do you make them go together?  No, you don't open them, and then they lose the value.  Do you move their arms and go like, ah.  He buys two.  One you keep in the package and one you open.  Because he's got the cash.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Oh, you're one of those keep it in the package guys.  It hangs on the wall.  And they're going to bust my balls for skateboarding.  But, I mean, how are you going to bust my balls for doing something active every day?  Because you're 32.  So what's better?  Sitting around on the couch?  He's older than 32.  Yeah, you're wrong by that, by the way.  But they're going to bust my balls for doing something active. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  But how much do you expect the wrestling figures to go up if you keep it in the box?  Let's be honest with each other.  Exactly.  Who's going to buy a macho man?  Exactly.  They actually generally go down in value.  They're not a good investment.  Of course they're not.  Of course not.  Because they're selling millions of them.  They're horrible investments.  Also, Troy skateboards in the park while E-Rock sits on the couch playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater  on Xbox.  Ah, yeah, you're an asshole.  I can relate.  Wow, actually getting out, getting some air, physical fitness.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You don't like his lack of physical prowess? 
[02:01:30]  It's just laziness.  It's just pure laziness.  But it's his life.  He has to live it.  Whatever.  Yeah, but he's not going to do the push-ups for 180.  That just...  That's a huge thing.  That taps into everything that you...  Although you love Eric, that taps into everything that...  And that is everything you hate about him.  Well, it's like, you know...  I went lower than the push-ups he did in the physical challenge, by the way.  18!  So this is a no-brainer for him.  Like, he knows he can do it.  Right.  His excuse for the physical fitness challenge was I only had to do 20, so I did them. 
[02:02:00]  He has to do less, and he gets more.  I will bet a thousand bucks he can't do 30.  Ooh.  Now let's just relax.  A thousand dollars?  Now let's just relax.  You really will.  Damn.  He can't do 30 push-ups.  Eric, a thousand dollars for 30 push-ups.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Nope, can't do 30.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  And I know he can't do 18, because I'm good.  Wouldn't you push it out, like, just fucking thinking about it?  Grand.  A thousand dollars off the table.  For a thousand dollars?  Nope, it's off the table right now.  Anybody can squeeze out 30.  It was there.  30 is a number that anybody could squeeze out if they really had to do it. 
[02:02:30]  A lot of fat guys are on EROC's side.  Jack Wiggum's, New Hampshire.  I thought Sam was going to be quiet today.  Tell him to shut his face and get off the mic.  Go EROC, one fat man to another.  EROC got How to Train Your Dragon on Blu-ray for a birthday present.  Aw, what is that?  That is true.  Ew!  What is it?  It's an animated movie.  Why would you want that?  It's good.  It's not good.  Because he has to consume.  That's why.  Because he just has to keep consuming. 
[02:03:00]  Wait, you don't like...  Is there a lot of consumption in EROC's pad?  It's just shit piled everywhere.  Look at the treats he got for his birthday this year.  What is that?  This is his birthday gift?  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It says early birthday gifts.  You won't watch them, will you?  What are the Saved by the Bell things?  He's got the whole series.  They're DVDs.  That's just stunk.  Wait, wait.  Read them all out.  Read them all.  EROC, you're older too.  What does he got?  He's got Saved by the Bell, three different box sets.  I'm assuming that must be the full series.  Okay.  Yeah.  Jack has three. 
[02:03:30]  That's a good movie.  Dead Space Downfall, Dead Space 2, and Bulletstorm for Xbox.  What about the Ghostbusters?  Well, and then I'm getting to the real Ghostbusters on DVD.  What does that mean?  Animated series.  That's cartoon.  The cartoon.  It's not even a movie.  You like cartoons?  You have.  You watched the cartoon Ghostbusters?  It was great.  No, it wasn't.  No, no, no.  Because you didn't watch it.  Exactly.  I was busy getting blown.  Your trannies are great.  I was eight.  All right.  Good.  You were 33. 
[02:04:00]  Turn down your mic.  Yay.  Eric was eight when Ghostbusters came out, right?  Yeah.  But he was much older than eight when Pinky and the Brain and Animaniacs were on TV.  And both those DVD sets are right there.  Are right there.  How old were you when Animaniacs was out?  Because I was older than eight.  Probably.  And you're much older than me.  I don't believe it.  12, 13?  No, you were older than 12 or 13.  You were probably 16 when Animaniacs came out.  No.  Well, 92, 93, around there.  It didn't come out in 92, 93.  You're lying.  Oh, it came out with Tiny Toons. 
[02:04:30]  Animaniacs was playing in like 94 still.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's when he was watching it.  Pretty sure.  At home, drinking Coke floats that his mom made him.  He didn't even scoop the ice cream in the cup himself.  I wish I had E-Roc's mom.  Now I'm sad.  Now I'm sad.  God damn.  Does he just remind you of somebody who's just handed everything that he wants?  Yeah.  Whatever he wants.  Just doesn't need to do anything.  That's why he doesn't need to work for the $180.  No.  Or even try to get the $1,000.  Yeah.  It's just such a... 
[02:05:00]  He should do it for you guys.  Yeah.  He should.  For the less fortunate.  You know what he should do?  He should do the push-ups, take the money, act like he's going to give it to me or Troy,  and then keep it for himself.  And go, fuck you, bitch.  And I say, I don't even need this.  I'm just going to add it to the money pile.  Just burn it in front of you.  Exactly.  There you go.  Wipe his ass with it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wouldn't you love to scream at Eric?  Sometimes you want to scream at him.  I don't know.  He has screamed at him before.  Saved by the bell, though.  I'm just looking at that.  Can't you just get that on demand for free? 
[02:05:30]  It's on TBS every day.  Yeah.  It's everywhere for free.  Wow.  I thought this was going to be a little thing, but now it's just becoming way too involved.  We got Russ.  On one side, we got America, Iraq.  And on the other side, we got Troy, who they're calling a Nazi at this point.  Yeah.  Oh.  A hipster Nazi.  A hipster Nazi.  Troy's busy staring at the birthday gift.  Holding my vomit in.  DVD collection of cartoons that baby boy has gotten.  And he's not even a stoner. 
[02:06:00]  It would be one thing if he smoked weed, and he's like, I sit around and watch cartoons.  But he doesn't smoke weed.  He just watches cartoons.  By the way, Travis just informed me that if the audience wants to see a picture of  Iraq's birthday gifts, they're at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you don't even give out fucking Iraq's Twitter.  You suck.  I did that on Facebook.  Did Iraq Twitter them or no?  I don't know.  Yeah, I Twittered that photo.  Who bought you those gifts?  I'm sorry, Sam.  Who bought you those gifts?  He bought them for himself.  That's the best part.  No, I didn't buy those for myself.  Yes, you didn't.  Some were for my mom. 
[02:06:30]  Who bought you?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  All right, wait.  Your mommy's buying you.  Honestly, now, Iraq's honest.  Which ones did your mom and dad get you?  Or your mom?  My mom got me the video games and Saved by the Bell.  I know the Saved by the Bell.  How did your mom get it?  Hold on.  But she wouldn't know to do that.  So you must have some kind of nice wish list out there.  I've asked her.  No, he's got his Amazon wish list.  You got a little wish list?  Yes, you do.  You have an Amazon wish list. 
[02:07:00]  So, Troy, are you annoyed that his mommy bought him Baby Boy some DVDs?  Baby Boy?  You just got to be kidding me.  What does your mommy buy you for your 30...  How old are you, Iraq?  33?  33.  All right, what did you get for your 33rd birthday?  I mean, occasionally, she'll put a check in a card and just say, hey, look, pay your bills,  do what you got to do with it.  There you go, right?  Do you like the fact that he's just getting basically toys this day?  Check it out.  Well, he doesn't need the checks.  Toys and clothes.  Cartoons.  Like, really?  The one that is on the even worse, that bothers me worse than Saved by the Bell, is the real 
[02:07:30]  Ghostbusters.  Oh, dude.  That's volume two.  The animation on it is horrible.  It's like not even a good, like, Warner Brothers old school type animation.  There's no storylines to them.  They're just, they're horrible.  There's storylines to the Ghostbusters.  It's a baby cartoon.  We see a little bit on YouTube.  It's not a baby cartoon.  I'll even give you Pinky and the Brain.  There's blood.  People get shot.  I'll give you Animaniacs, where it's like, there was some adult shit there. 
[02:08:00]  There's a lot of adult shit in there.  But, but, but, the real Ghostbusters, stop.  It was a baby cartoon.  Eric, how old were you when you watched the real Ghostbusters?  Uh, I was under ten.  When you just yelled and said, I was eight.  And now you're saying it's not a baby cartoon.  Then what were you doing watching it when you were eight?  I was a kid and it was on TV.  Cartoons.  Saturday morning.  What the fuck else do you do?  When you're a child?  That, that seems appropriate.  I think what bugs everybody is that you want to hold on to your baby boy child.  Yes.  That's what it is.  I am not bothering anybody with it. 
[02:08:30]  I agree.  I'm not saying you need to watch this.  I'm not saying you need to get me these things.  I'm not saying you need to, you should own these things.  The Boogeyman is Back episode we're looking at.  Can you turn the volume up?  Look at this.  Some of those adult themes.  Yeah, here we go.  The helicopter's taking.  Perfectly bad 80s music.  Horror animation.  There's a big monster chasing a helicopter.  It's like G.I. Joe animation. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, look.  Those are the Ghostbusters.  I hate cartoons.  And now they're.  Oh, they got the beam.  They got the ghost.  Right in the trap.  In the trap.  Now, funny line.  Boy, Egon.  For a minute there, I thought you were street pizza.  And the green ghost monster licked his face.  Yeah.  They're French.  What?  I'm fine, Ray.  Thanks for asking. 
[02:09:30]  This fucking stinks.  Oh, he's fine.  You have to like it for what it was.  Shitty.  You're 33.  Listen to it is some of the most horrible.  Don't watch it.  Do you get it, Troy, now?  Now you get it more?  Does that annoy you more to see what that really is?  No, Iraq.  It's not just don't watch it.  It's not just don't watch it.  Like, you could dress like a baby, right?  And the guy would be like, you know, so just don't dress like a baby.  And you're like, that's not the point.  You're dressed like a baby.  Like, you're watching this.  It doesn't matter. 
[02:10:00]  Like, don't watch it.  Why would you watch that?  How many do you watch in a row of these cartoons?  Honestly.  Oh.  Oh.  They're not good.  He's farting in here.  Like, I don't know, three or four episodes at a time.  I'm sure it's not the cartoon we just played?  Oh, look at the floating green thing.  Yeah.  So you'll, I think that's what Ebert found in his jaw.  So you'll fucking watch.  What will you do when you watch these?  What kind of snack do you have?  You have to have a snack.  It's usually either Cherry Coke Zero or Diet Dr. Pepper. 
[02:10:30]  And, uh.  Cherry Coke E-Rock.  Snyder's Pretzels.  And what else?  Snyder's Pretzels.  Snyder's Pretzels.  The big sourdough ones.  I love those.  I do, too.  Flavored ones.  You might be turning us a little bit.  Dave in Georgia writes, Sam talking shit about cartoons yet still watches wrestling.  Yeah, but so does E-Rock.  Oh.  And what's it?  So the only thing worse than watching wrestling is watching wrestling and cartoons.  Says the guy who has closets in his parents' house full of wrestling figures. 
[02:11:00]  So do you.  I don't have closets.  What are they?  Drawers?  No.  There's a few hanging on the wall.  Shut the fuck up, bro.  Can you believe these are adults?  Just shut up.  I would do 18 push-ups for $180.  Troy, would you bring E-Rock around to your real friends?  Nope.  For a day of skateboarding?  And listen to bands no one has heard of?  You know, I've done a lot of groovy t-shirts.  Groovy t-shirts.  He's got another groovy t-shirt on today. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  What is that representing, man?  I have no idea.  It's just a cool graffiti.  A blonde kid in a gas mask in front of a giant tree of life looking thing.  A blue tree.  I have no idea what that means.  I don't either.  It just looks cool.  What would you...  What's the statement there?  You do know.  I don't know.  What does that say?  How does that talk to you?  I think it just says, man!  Or is that a mushroom cloud?  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  The government's coming to get you.  No.  Or is it a tree disguised as a mushroom cloud?  And that's the riddle, my friends.  Is that a government lie? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I just...  I can't believe that...  You don't like this cartoon?  I just...  I can't believe that a 33-year-old man would sit around and just watch this.  That mother bought him.  Yeah.  Mommy bought a baby boy cartoon.  Yeah.  I do like E-Rock's answer, though.  But then don't fucking, you know...  Don't fucking watch and, you know, it's not bothering anyone.  Yeah, but Troy's right.  In the end, it's not bothering anyone.  Troy's right.  I never bring this shit up, ever.  What about your wife?  Is she a little annoyed by your habits?  Oh, God, that's gotta annoy her. 
[02:12:30]  No, she just ignores it at this point.  But then what if she wants to sit down and watch something on the television?  She can.  Be honest with me.  Does she shop at Toys R Us for you for Christmas?  No.  What did she buy for your birthday?  What?  What did she buy for your birthday?  She buys me shit that I should have that I don't buy for myself.  Like what?  That's the stuff you just throws in the corner when he opens up, and then he opens up the  toys.  Yeah.  She buys me better clothing.  Large.  Where is it?  Where is it?  Large.  Large. 
[02:13:00]  I don't wear it here, but I have it.  What else does she buy you?  Um, I don't know.  It's usually just shit that I don't have, or she throws stuff that I have out and says,  you don't need this anymore.  Replace it with this stuff.  Bring me these.  You know, she's a real pretty girl.  She's really cool.  Oh, yeah.  So, I just don't know.  She's close to a hipster herself.  She's just a cool rock chick.  You know what I mean?  I just don't know how she could look at this.  Oh. 
[02:13:30]  And I'm pointing to the Ghostbusters.  Yes.  And be like.  I wish she didn't explain that to the audience.  And be like, my husband.  Fuck, yeah.  My husband.  Watches that.  Sits around, and he watches this.  It's a real Ghostbusters animation series.  You don't think it satisfies him?  He doesn't want to work out.  He wants to look at this.  Oh, here comes the Ghostbusters now.  They got a.  Oh, no.  Oh, a scary clown.  Oh, they're putting their backpacks on, but they still got their pajamas on. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, do you think they're going to shoot their beams out?  You know, it's like every episode, them with the beams, because kids thought the beam was  the coolest thing.  Like, every fucking.  I've been watching this dumbass fuck cartoon now since it's been put on.  It's still been playing without the sound.  And they've used the backpacks and shot the beams at least five times already.  This is terrible animation.  Well, that's because it's not designed for adults.  It's horrible.  It's designed for eight-year-olds.  An analytical mind isn't supposed to watch that? 
[02:14:30]  For what?  Like, what would you get out of that?  It's just sound and colors.  Yeah.  That's all.  Just flash in front of you.  Sound and colors.  Waste time.  You know?  I hate animation, so it just, it bores me.  Good animation, I love.  But that shit was done by the 50s.  That shit was over.  Bugs Bunny is the only cartoon I can enjoy as an adult.  Yeah, Bugs is good.  Fucking.  That shit with dumb Yosemite Sam.  Yeah, that was some funny.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:15:00]  She also got me Book of Mormon tickets.  Are you trying to?  That's nice.  When are you going to see Book of Mormon?  The cartoon version?  You went, how'd you like it?  It was great.  Yeah.  I went the same night you did.  Did I see you that night?  No, you were at the earlier show.  We went to the later show.  Oh, matinee Wednesday.  And E-Rock does have his supporters out there.  Yeah?  I do want some.  Absolutely.  And it's nice to know we got some hipsters listening because they're supporting Troy.  Good.  Troy is very angry at E-Rock. 
[02:15:30]  Well, he's right about E-Rock's like slovenly lifestyle that he lives at home.  Slovenly.  Affecting us in the workplace when we're a team.  I think what we have to do here is, I think you two have to like switch roles for an afternoon.  Where E-Rock has to do some skateboarding downtown.  Yeah, and you've got to sit in a dark room and watch cartoons.  I can do it.  And then you come back with your experience and maybe we learn something.  But how are you going to make E-Rock go outside?  He won't even do 18 push-ups for $180.  Plus the 10 bucks for every push-up he does after. 
[02:16:00]  He wouldn't do 30 for $1,000.  And that deals off the table.  They're all little kids in this cartoon.  Like, E-Rock, do you imagine that you're one of these kids?  No.  No?  No.  But I used to have the Ghostbusters stuff when I was a kid.  The backpack and the trap.  And the...  What's the trap?  You trap the ghost sin.  So they trap the ghost sin.  I know from, you know, the movie I saw years ago.  And I have seen this cartoon.  And like, I was so annoyed by it. 
[02:16:30]  The lack of animation.  No fucking...  No story to it.  Nothing funny going on at all.  Nothing.  Did you dress up as a Ghostbuster for Halloween growing up?  Halloween, no.  What is that?  Wait.  What does Halloween know mean?  On the weekends.  You did?  On the weekends, you just dress up as a Ghostbuster and play Ghostbusters with your little friends?  Maybe.  We would play Vietnam when I was a kid.  We had guns and we'd run around the neighborhood shooting each other. 
[02:17:00]  I can't criticize anybody else's childhood games.  I know.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I'm in no position.  Monster Rain was a fun one.  So wait.  Your mom bought you the backpack?  Oh, yeah.  You'd get it for like your birthday and Christmas and you'd get all the accessories.  Can we have you guys switch?  Seriously.  I think there's something there.  Come up with a few things that Troy really digs.  What do you like to do, Troy?  When I get out of here?  Yeah.  Definitely like an hour of something physical, you know?  Either skateboarding or biking.  So we get E-Rock to go outside and like, all right, if you can't skateboard, although 
[02:17:30]  that'd be cool to go and skateboard with the guys.  Oh, awesome skateboard.  We could put a helmet and all the knee and elbow pads on them.  We could film the shit out of this and then you come back and, you know, talk about  your experience living like the other guy.  Yeah.  Because you guys are on the complete opposites here.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Just sit around and watch cartoons and eat shit all day.  And fall asleep.  And you're forced to eat each other's meals.  Yeah.  So you're going to have to, what is it?  What does he do with his water again? 
[02:18:00]  He pours powders in them that are half lemonade, half ice.  No, I know that.  But what do you call it?  A treat.  Treats.  So you're going to have to put treats in your water for a day.  I'll sleep from about four o'clock till nine o'clock at night and then wake up for  a bit and then go back to sleep at three and then show up late for work.  Oh, wow.  Oh, damn.  Do I have your permission to do that?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, if you want me to do it, I'll do it.  We certainly give you permission.  And E-Rock, I mean, what would you do as Troy? 
[02:18:30]  Let's see.  I'd go home.  I'd look and shop for bad clothing.  I'd go to the park and then skateboard till, you know, grownups tell me to get out of  the park because you can't skateboard here.  So me and a bunch of 13-year-olds would leave.  Then I'd get some drink that looks like lawn clippings and say how delicious it is.  Check every store window to make sure my hair looks really good.  And then I'd go back to my empty apartment with my MacBook and look at things online and 
[02:19:00]  people enjoying life that I'm not.  Wow.  Fucking E-Rock.  E-Rock comes right back.  You look like an asshole, Troy.  Wow, Troy.  E-Rock, you would have to come in with one of these hip t-shirts, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure you can.  Yeah, skinny jeans.  Yeah, skinny jeans that you pay $500 that have a million holes so you look like you're homeless.  Ah, hipster jeans.  These are brand new jeans.  They have no holes in them.  How much?  Here's the holes.  You do yoga.  I got these at Uniclo for like $50. 
[02:19:30]  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Oh, do I do yoga?  I don't do yoga.  Oh.  I mean, I have no problem with yoga.  It's fine.  I just don't do it.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with yoga.  Especially if you have a bad...  Listen to you laughing back there, motherfucker.  That hurts.  Oh, shit.  Is he addressing the peanut gallery now?  No, that's fine.  Because Troy just got made to look like a complete asshole after all this.  He really did.  The whole thing culminated in E-Rock coming way back.  It was almost like wrestling.  Yeah.  It was like the Hulkster where he's like, no, he starts shaking the ropes and shit. 
[02:20:00]  He's like, yeah.  That's when you thought E-Rock was down.  He's going to tell me I'm childish for skateboarding, but yet he's watching cartoons.  How is that possible?  Yeah, but he said he doesn't get...  I'm not doing it in public to embarrass myself.  I'm embarrassing myself.  I'm doing physical activity.  Physical activity.  With 13-year-olds.  There's no 13-year-olds.  He doesn't get kicked out of the park for watching Ghostbusters.  Yeah, that's true, too.  They're too late.  I've never gotten kicked out of the park.  Thank you very much.  He closes at dusk, you know.  Get off the sidewalks.  They're saying E-Rock for the win, Troy.  It really was.  Wow.  I'm on Team E-Rock now. 
[02:20:30]  He kicked your ass.  That's fine.  Enjoy your cartoons.  I was until you opened your mouth.  Whoa!  Oh!  Nothing is going to change E-Rock.  No, no.  That's crazy stuff.  But the 180 bucks for 18 push-ups.  Yeah, that's the big thing.  That's ridiculous.  Do you eat late at night ever, E-Rock?  No, I used to, but I stopped that a long time ago.  Bullshit.  Oh, wait.  Fuck you.  Troy doesn't believe you.  I'm not believing that either.  And he does?  Look at him.  I'm not believing that.  I mean, he comes in here and eats salad. 
[02:21:00]  That's what we see him eat, because he stopped eating food now in front of us.  Sorry, I can't eat Wendy's every day like you do.  I apologize.  Yo, you're kidding me, right?  You see when I eat Wendy's, motherfucker.  Ooh.  You do.  So don't bring up that shit.  Now it's real.  You see that.  Exactly.  One day a week.  It's some real shit now.  One day a week.  I juice every fucking day.  And beef.  So don't be like, oh, yeah, you eat Wendy's every day.  Fuck you.  You don't know what...  You see what I eat.  Yeah, twigs and berries and lawn clippings and leaves.  I thought I went to Wendy's.  And you go, I'm so healthy. 
[02:21:30]  Yo, let's do it.  Let's take a lap around the block.  Let's do a race around the block.  I thought I went last time.  I'm just going to stop and you win.  You won.  Go ahead.  Name the physical activity.  You won.  Name the physical activity.  Let's do it.  He won't do it.  Let's see what drinking lawn clippings and exercising every day will do.  What do you want to do?  I don't want to do shit.  Okay.  Well, then shut the fuck up.  No.  You came in here and started this shit.  I didn't come in here and start this shit.  You did too.  You did.  You came in here.  You don't do this.  You don't do that.  And I'll go, yep, you're right.  I don't do any of that.  And you're like, why aren't you doing this? 
[02:22:00]  Challenge me.  No, because I'm not doing it.  Oh.  Then shut the fuck up.  Then you shut the fuck up.  I'll challenge you on anything physical you want.  No.  Anything.  Go eat a tree.  Go eat a tree.  Are you saying he eats Wendy's a lot, Iraq?  I take that back.  I always see him with Wendy's.  Exactly.  I enjoy fast food once a week.  Oh, well, it looks like Troy enjoys a treat, too.  That's called willpower, though.  Yeah, once a week.  And that's why I think.  Look what I'm fucking.  Well, they do say you should give yourself a cheat day. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard that over the years.  You say they give yourself a cheat day.  You have too many cheat days.  Sam and I go down to Wendy's and hang out with the nice Wendy's down there.  You're actually that more healthy day.  It's one day a week.  We try to pick up the cashiers at Wendy's.  Oh.  Oh, really?  What's that about it?  Yeah, we flirt with them and they give us free food.  Really?  True.  Iraq, though, I don't see you having that type of willpower not to eat at night before  you go to bed.  That's tough for anyone.  It's hard for me at night.  It was part of my sleep problem. 
[02:23:00]  What do you mean what would happen?  Tell us.  You'd be chewing while he's trying to sleep.  No.  What would keep you awake?  What would you have?  I don't know.  It was just crap.  Well, I make the mistake sometimes, even when I eat salt.  Salt, for some reason, keeps me up.  Or I would have a Diet Coke late at night.  It's like the caffeine and that.  Really?  Or if I have fruits late at night, the sugar and the fruit motherfucking keeps me up.  Yeah, I can't have anything like that.  You're not tired?  I am.  I'm tired. 
[02:23:30]  If I have a bad one, like where I eat some salt, and then I have caffeine, and I'll wake  up, like I'll fall asleep, and I'll wake up, and I'll go, oh boy, you're not getting  back to sleep.  That's why a lot of times I'm loopy when I come in.  A lot of times, if I'm going to bed, I could snort crystal meth and fucking my eyes are at  half-mast.  You can't do that.  Ready to go to sleep.  What would you have late at night, Eric?  It'd be whatever was, you know, still in the house.  Like what?  I mean, come on.  Don't be so vague.  Still in the house.  Pretzels, popcorn.  Stop with the food that's like all right.  Yeah.  Like you think, oh, popcorn, not buttered. 
[02:24:00]  Some Snyder's pretzels, you know, the kind without buttered.  Who said not buttered?  It's fucking extreme movie theater butter.  All right.  Oh, you don't get the not buttered?  Well, you mix it up, but I tend to lean towards the other side.  Don't ever say lean again.  Exactly.  I tend to list to one side.  Collapse.  I think there's some fattening stuff going on when you're eating.  Some treats.  Some cakey stuff.  Some pastas.  Maybe ice cream.  I'll say again.  He don't give a fuck.  Eric likes to carbo-load.  No ice cream.  But ice pops. 
[02:24:30]  But isn't carbo-loading for marathoners?  Yeah.  I mean, but he goes step one.  It's a process.  He's going to learn to carbo-load, then he'll start to marathon.  When do they carbo-load?  The night before?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Every night, apparently.  I don't know.  All right.  He got very mad when he said bread.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes pizzas.  The disgust.  Elio's pizza, huh?  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'll be on Eric's side.  Hey, whoa, you like that, huh?  Nothing wrong with an Elio's.  Every once in a while. 
[02:25:00]  How many slices do you have in one sitting?  Well, it comes in three slices.  E-Rock, you just crack them off like shingles?  Is that what you're saying?  You just line them up like shingles on a roof?  Just bite into them like a Charleston chip.  You guys used to be friends, huh?  I'm still friends with Eric.  I like Eric.  I like him as a person.  I really do.  He's a cool dude.  He just gave you the business.  That's fine.  He did.  He did give you the business right there.  No, I mean...  Made you look like a hipster douchebag.  Yeah.  Eric and I have a history, so...  I definitely like Eric, but... 
[02:25:30]  History of him putting you in your place.  Oh, damn.  And didn't he?  Oh, yes, he did.  Troy came in here.  I was embarrassed for Troy for a little bit there.  He was a fireball when he came in here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Boy, it was Eric Nagel, the fire extinguisher, on duty.  Yeah, E-Rock was killing there for a while.  Yeah.  And Nagel just was one after another.  Remember the Twig and Barry's thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Made him look like a dick.  Nothing.  Fair enough.  If only the virus was that quick.  Yeah.  That was great.  You guys really arguing? 
[02:26:00]  Troy really getting mad at him?  Yeah, yeah.  He was really mad.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Best fuck you ever.  Sounds like Troy.  Can we hear that one more time?  Fuck you!  He's so...  He was mad.  It just came out.  Bobo was so mad.  He threw it up.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All right, we should break, I guess.  Yeah, take a break.  I didn't forget about My Dick's So Shitty, by the way.  Ah.  Oh, you do have it.  My dick's all shitty. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  From your asshole.  That was about an hour ago.  Yeah.  We'll put it all together.  The song's timeless.  It doesn't matter.  Troy, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll do some other stuff.  Stay there.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  Testing supplies.  Fuck you!  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty.  From your asshole. 
[02:27:00]  Dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty.  From your asshole.  Say you won't blow me like it in your face. 
[02:27:30]  Say you only take the cock in your dirty place.  Oh, my dick's so shitty.  Now I'm all filthy, there's duty on my dick, it looks just like a black man's, but not quite as thick, your cooling needs a diaper, cause I'm in your golden glow, got a dirty handbook, and my dick's so shitting, my dick's so shitting from your asshole. 
[02:28:00]  My dick's so shitting, my dick's so shitting from your asshole.  My dick's so shitting, my dick's so shitting from your asshole. 
[02:28:30]  Opie and Anthony. The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Mid-show prep sheet time.  Wow, we got mid-sheet prep, yeah, mid-show prep sheet, mid-sheet prep show.  I do have to say, that was a lot of fun listening to E-Rock and Troy, and everyone was represented in that argument.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. 
[02:29:00]  Hearing from the Troys out there, hearing from the E-Rocks out there, seems like no one in between.  It's either, you're kind of an E-Rock guy or a Troy guy.  Yeah, yeah.  But E-Rock just fucking killed. When you push him against the wall, he finally starts fighting back.  He falls through it.  He comes up with some jumps.  Oh, that's what you meant.  What do you want to do? Mid-show prep sheet? I heard Jimmy during the break go, enough with this Tracy Morgan, basically, right?  Now he's in Nashville, hanging out, meeting audience members. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  This is not Tracy Morgan.  Now he's looking silly.  I guess that 30-rock money must be good, and that's why he's doing all this, because we know the real, in my opinion, Tracy, he doesn't want to be telling us.  I've got to pay my rent.  I'm going to apologize to every one of them homos.  I kind of dislike GLAAD, too, because they know what they're doing.  They're holding him hostage.  They got one. They caught one.  Said, all right, we're going to take advantage of this.  I can't get out that trap.  You can't.  I can't get out that trap, Opie. 
[02:30:00]  They caught me.  Now I can't do nothing.  I'm on apology tour.  Waddle doodle.  GLAAD will eventually let him go back into the wild, I guess, right?  Into the wild.  They're going to release him.  Yeah, they're going to release him.  Yeah, he's going to be tagged.  We got him.  They got me.  They put a radio antenna around my neck and put a big ear thing in my ear.  I wouldn't be surprised if GLAAD gives him one of those scars from Planet of the Apes.  Oh, God.  And cut out his brain.  And I wasn't going racist, yes, because the white guy had the fucking scar. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Before you start trying to.  I'm not a racist anymore.  And then you're like, wait, wait.  Turn around.  Oh, I'm not a homophobe.  Right.  And he's got that big fucking receding hairline cut from where they cut his brain out.  What I don't understand about that whole scene, by the way, the scar was nice and healed like  it happened years ago.  Yeah, wouldn't the hair have grown in?  That always bothered me.  The hair would have grown in already over it.  Right.  Never would have saw it.  Or the scar would have still been red and kind of still healing.  Yeah.  Gushy.  But that scene in Planet of the Apes, wasn't that? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  When you saw that for the first time?  There he is.  That was.  You have kinship with this man?  That was horrifying.  Dumb ape.  Horrifying when you saw that scar in that movie.  Yeah.  But that's what they're doing to fucking Tracy.  Poor Tracy Morgan.  He should have, like you said, I think, Jimmy, apologized.  That's it.  I apologize.  One apology and then you're done.  But it's like, Gladys is no different than any of the groups.  Of course not.  When they have their fucking, when they have you, when they got you, when they've, as  we say, caught you with your hand in the cookie jar, they milk it.  Because they use you as a bullhorn for themselves. 
[02:31:30]  About cookie jar, they mean asshole.  Yeah.  They got me in their tender graces and embraces.  Because I don't do Tracy's voice.  That's it, though.  Because Gladys.  Lunchbox.  Time to check in.  Time to punch in.  Get that lunchbox.  Go to work.  Go to what?  I am.  I am.  I'm here.  You mean.  But now he's in Nashville.  When does this end?  I don't know.  But that's how famous Tracy is.  Genuinely famous, famous guy.  How much stuff has he had to do already? 
[02:32:00]  He's done the photo op.  He did the apology, the fake apology, in our opinion.  Now he's meeting the audience members in Nashville.  I think he's doing PSAs.  This is ridiculous.  Gladys should be ashamed of themselves to try to change someone's mindset on something.  Not one.  Not one.  I guarantee you Tracy doesn't care about gays either way.  Just trying to entertain his audience.  This obsession with the apology.  I'm sick of it.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, what did Joe Coy do? 
[02:32:30]  I don't even know.  He said something.  I think he was on stage.  He opened his zipper.  And he has girls that want to fuck him.  And some guy looked.  He goes, what did you look at my dick, you fag?  Or did you do some gays?  It was nothing.  It was just a fag.  It was just a fag.  It was, you look at my dick.  What are you, a faggot?  You said faggot.  Or fucking faggot.  Did that hit the blogs?  Oh, it hit.  It did.  Some cunt reporter in fucking Chicago picked up on it.  And he had to apologize.  He jumped into an apology before anyone really asked for it either. 
[02:33:00]  Well, Joe is not on the radar like Tracy is.  I mean, he's well-known enough when he has to say sorry.  I guess he does Chelsea's show a lot.  Yeah.  So he doesn't want to ruin that gig.  So he jumped right on the apology.  Is he the backward hat guy from Chelsea Handler?  I don't know what he wears.  I don't know who he wears.  I've only done it with him a couple of times.  I don't know what he wears.  I don't know what he does.  Oh, okay.  That guy.  Different guy.  He was an over-the-top apology, too.  Like, I sincerely apologize. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  You think GLAAD suggests that Tracy sucks a dick?  You should know what it's like.  You know, you guys don't really know what this is like.  How far do they take it when they have it?  How far do they take it in that back room?  Right.  Oh, shit.  I got to suck a dick.  I don't like no dick.  I'm CNN.  That GLAAD person wants me to suck a dick.  Is that far-fetched, though?  Come on.  I know. 
[02:34:00]  I imagine he'll be in some kind of parade soon.  I don't know.  We got your outfit for the gay pride parade, Tracy?  I really don't like it.  Yeah, Joe Coy's apology was, I sincerely apologize for the incredibly foul word I chose to use on stage last night.  He doesn't believe that?  In Chicago.  It was a moment that I regret.  I realized that words can be hurtful.  Words hurt it.  Which is, yeah.  Which is never my intent.  I'm truly saddened if I offended anyone with my poor choice of words. 
[02:34:30]  Because, particularly the gay community, homophobia is not funny.  That almost sounds like someone goofing on an apology.  Yeah.  It's that over-the-top where I started reading and going, is he fucking with me?  Is he fucking with this apology?  Ah.  No guy that's a stand-up comic that does that even for a second on stage, who goes, hey, are you a fucking faggot? 
[02:35:00]  On stage to the crowd, believes in that apology the next day.  Stop it.  Joe is getting a following.  He has a following.  But, I mean, he's in a place where people know who he is now.  He's got a good regular spot on Chelsea's show.  He doesn't want to blow it.  Like, Tracy could, Tracy doesn't want to blow it either, but Tracy could survive being thrown off a 30 rock.  Yeah.  His career would survive if he'd do movies.  He's just looking like, ah, I need some more time.  I've got to buy some time in the public eye.  Joe's doing a spot on a popular show, but he doesn't have his own show. 
[02:35:30]  He's not as established, Tracy, so I think he was worried that he was going to blow it and, you know.  Are the gays the, I don't know, cause du jour?  Yeah, that's the...  Is that what it is?  Of course!  They're the one.  They're right now the special interest group with the loudest voice.  It was a couple years ago.  The Asians.  The Asians had it.  And then, uh, uh, black groups have always come and gone with it.  They come, they have it, they don't have it, they have it, they don't have it.  A few years ago, after Michael Richards, uh, blew up, everybody was, uh, and they, they, they did a funeral for the word nigger. 
[02:36:00]  And then, fucking, what's his name?  But like Jesus, it came back.  It came back.  With a vengeance.  And it didn't even take three days.  No, no, no.  Later that afternoon, it was alive and well and, uh, my co-pilot on my way home.  And they, uh, that was the cause, it was all racism and now it's, uh, homophobia.  Now it's homophobia.  It's a fucking, it's an annoying shell game and then you pull the shell off and whoever's got the fucking loudest voice is the one you pay attention to.  And it's all insincere. 
[02:36:30]  It's all insincere.  Oh, totally.  You know what I'll believe in apology?  When somebody does something and then comes out before there's a praying goes, you know what?  I was doing a set last night.  Right.  And I felt kind of bad that I said something I was stupid.  Or like, I shouldn't have said that.  Yeah, I just want to apologize.  Great point.  I felt bad about it.  I don't knock apologies.  Like, sometimes people are sorry.  Like, sometimes you legitimately fuck up and go, you know what?  I mean, I'm not above apologizing.  You're like, hey, I'm sorry, man.  I shouldn't have done that. 
[02:37:00]  But it's always the same thing.  It's always in defense of yourself when the special interest group is swinging a mace at your head.  That's always when it is.  It's never like, God, you know what?  That was kind of, like, literally, I've been debating apologizing for something.  Not to anybody I know.  Because it's something that I, eh, I've stated before.  Turkey foot?  No, turkey pubis.  You never say you're sorry.  You tickle the pubis.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:37:30]  I'm going to wipe that up.  You make turkey noises, and sometimes you hit the little root.  Oh, God.  The little stem that points up, because it's so small.  Oh, my God.  That's just turkey pubis.  That's terrible.  You can get the whole works in your mouth.  Wait, you might apologize for something, Jimmy?  It wouldn't be a public thing, no.  Oh, okay.  But, I mean, it would be a, it was just, it's been something I wouldn't say I feel bad about.  It's just the right thing to do.  Not even. 
[02:38:00]  It's just something I want to do, because I kind of feel like I went too far on something.  And when I mean too far...  Your parents?  Yes.  So sorry for having shamed you.  For being me.  But no, something that I look at, and it's like, I don't feel the same way.  So I'm like, eh.  But there's no pressure to do it.  It's simply something I've been thinking about for probably a year.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Interesting.  I think we all would apologize for stuff.  Yeah, but it's, when you say something publicly, or when you take a stand publicly, and then you  look back on it, and you go, eh, I don't feel that way. 
[02:38:30]  If you say, look, I'm sorry I said certain things, it's different than groveling with a special  interest rifle pointed at your head.  Well, that's what's happening here.  Tracy, to apologize.  So he's down there in Nashville, Tuesday, to issue an apology to the lesbian and gay  community after an anti-blah, blah, blah.  Morgan was scheduled to address reporters Tuesday morning at the Nashville Convention Center  after meeting with members of the audience who were offended by his comedy routine and  representatives from gay advocacy groups.  How many audience members now? 
[02:39:00]  I bet you that number's got way the fuck up.  I don't know.  Morgan was not expected to take questions during the news conference, so that's going on in  Nashville today.  Poor, poor Tracy.  I hope they release him soon.  The other time you should take questions is if you're fighting it.  Because they'll ask questions, is gay bashing funny?  Oh, God.  And then you have to point out that a lot of things aren't funny that you address in humor,  and that's the gift of humor, is addressing things that aren't funny and allowing people 
[02:39:30]  to laugh about them.  It's just that I don't want to repeat myself, but people know it's just annoying.  It is annoying.  Oh, sorry.  What happened?  Oh, nothing.  Just people know it.  You've got to bounce people sometimes, and they don't give you the full name.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Please.  Flying fuck. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  It's okay.  We'll just move on.  This Obama thing, anything to it?  The whole election, him being our president.  Oh, what?  Well, I know it.  What did Farrakhan say?  Farrakhan is very angry with him at his policy in Libya, Afghanistan.  Well, do you want to do the Obama impersonator, or do you want to do the Farrakhan?  There's two good...  Oh.  I think Farrakhan would be shorter.  Farrakhan's cool, yeah.  Because he said... 
[02:40:30]  Farrakhan said that he's one of these guys that, like, you know, he likes Gaddafi.  He's met with them.  Yeah, yeah.  He really likes him.  I like Farrakhan, but I said, come on, man.  What are you doing?  Gaddafi's a cunt.  I think the Knicks are looking at one of Farrakhan's nephews or sons.  Uh, really?  Yeah, supposedly he's got skills.  Was it Farrakhan's kid?  Could you give me the Daily News ad?  What about that one?  Yeah, this fucking...  What do you got on Farrakhan?  Farrakhan's angry that Obama is pretty much doing the same stuff that Bush did, is what 
[02:41:00]  he said.  This is what Farrakhan's saying.  And he came in with all these promises of being, you know, a different guy, a guy with  these other different dreams and hopes, and he's just doing exactly the same thing that  other people are doing.  Um, and he's saying that this whole thing with Libya is, uh, murder, uh, from the White  House.  He's murdering people.  And the whole deal with Libya really is fucked up because, uh, there, there's no reason for  us to even be involved in that whole thing.  We shouldn't spend dollar one on that shit country. 
[02:41:30]  Whatever happens here is none of our fucking business.  It's supposed to be under the guise of protecting civilians from this regime.  Meanwhile, the civilians are the ones with rocket launchers in the back of their Toyotas  shooting at Gaddafi's guys.  Now, believe me, I'm no friend of Gaddafi.  Uh, the guy's a terrorist if you ask me, and you don't even have to ask me, it's, it's  history is proven, uh, responsible for the, the Lockerbie, uh, bombing.  Of course.  And, um, but, but you can't just go into a sovereign nation, uh, when there is really 
[02:42:00]  no threat to your own country and start fucking shit up with, with, uh, the leadership there.  He's a dictator.  He's been a dictator there for a lot of years.  Just leave him the fuck alone.  If his people ever want to revolt, they'll do it.  And when they started doing it, let him continue.  If he kicks their ass, that's called history.  Can I ask you a question?  Uh, hasn't, uh, past presidents done exactly that too, or no?  Sure.  Yeah, but sometimes. 
[02:42:30]  What's the difference here is, I guess, what I'm asking.  Sometimes they're able to put it under the guise of national security.  Uh, an unstable Middle East would be a bad thing for the United States.  So even if it's not a direct threat, sometimes they can sell it like we got to go in there.  That I understand.  The Kuwait situation.  Saddam Hussein going into Kuwait.  He was threatening Saudi Arabia.  That's one of our big oil guys.  We need to protect that.  That's why George W., uh, George Sr. went in.  Uh, this has nothing to do. 
[02:43:00]  So this is his idea of a humanitarian effort is going in because he, if you ask him, it's  Gaddafi's troops wiping out innocent civilians.  Meanwhile, there's an uprising going on.  It's a revolution.  These civilians are, are people with guns and fucking artillery.  They're well armed, aren't they?  Yeah, and they're firing on Gaddafi's troops to try to oust him as the leader. 
[02:43:30]  It's a revolution.  Uh, one side wins, one side loses, and so be it.  But for us to get involved in that under the guise of a humanitarian mission, when Syria  is going through the same thing and Yemen is going through the same thing, and we didn't  get involved in that, why?  Why aren't we helping those poor civilians?  Because they didn't embarrass us by fucking, uh, welcoming home a bomber.  Right.  Well, they said they would keep low-key, and that was Gaddafi's recent sin. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Because he embarrassed the U.S., and we don't have the fucking cock to really criticize fucking  London for that.  Oh, yeah.  Or to really criticize Scotland for that.  Scotland.  We don't have the fucking cock to do that, to say, Scotland, you released a guy who murdered  X amount of our citizens, we are going to cut diplomatic ties.  Like, why not?  And for a trade-off, for a fucking oil, whatever the hell they were getting for that deal.  We never should have protected Saudi Arabia.  We should have allowed, we should have allowed fucking Saddam Hussein. 
[02:44:30]  In hindsight, I never should have wanted that.  We should have allowed Saddam to win, and fuck Kuwait, and fuck Saudi Arabia, and fuck Libya.  I don't care about any of their citizens.  They don't care about us.  They would never fucking help us.  Yeah.  I'm just tired.  We would have had an oil problem.  We would have had an oil problem.  Tough shit.  Fucking, this is where, this is where alternative energy has to come in, or we go to Alaska.  Enough with the slavery to fucking, uh, foreign oil.  I'm tired of it.  But it's more complicated than just tough shit, don't you think, with the oil thing? 
[02:45:00]  No.  Because we gotta, we gotta move forward, obviously, and not, not depend on all these fucking people.  Then we have to, then we have to hit back somehow.  But we can't do that today.  Uh, we have, how does Israel get oil?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  From us.  Is that what happens?  We, we buy it from the Middle East, and we sell it back to them.  So, are you amazed that, uh, Qaddafi's lasted as long as he has?  I am stunned and amazed.  Unbelievable, huh?  This guy is saying, fuck you, to all those bastards.  Fair to say we were kids when Qaddafi first came around. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, three, I think.  He was that Ronald Reagan.  He was, he was Reagan's nemesis.  What's this?  Him and Maggie Thatcher used to talk shit about him.  What's this?  Great.  Curb Your Enthusiasm.  What's that?  Where's my episode two?  What's Curb Your Enthusiasm?  Anyone?  What is that?  Curb.  I'll take it.  But what about Breaking Bad?  Is he funny?  Yeah, he did sign, Bill.  So funny.  So funny.  It's pretty good.  I don't know Curb.  Oh, I can't wait.  Yeah, I want to be ahead of Curb.  New show? 
[02:46:00]  I want to be a spoiler for everyone else.  You want this?  I know this.  I have no reason to watch this.  You don't like Curb?  I've never heard of it before.  Oh, really?  It's a good show.  It's good?  It is.  Kick him to the...  Right?  Put your mouth on the...  Curb.  Right.  How about we do this?  So Farrakhan talks about Obama.  Yeah, he's very angry.  Put you in a tough spot, sir.  Well...  You don't like either one of these guys.  Tell you the truth.  I agree more with some of Farrakhan's... 
[02:46:30]  Not his teachings or speech.  Some of his ideology on race.  I believe more on Farrakhan's side than I do Obama's.  You believe the radical?  Like he's more radical than a lot of them?  Just a little.  But he really believes that white people are primarily at fault.  And, you know, it's like that...  I'm sure he does.  Well, you know, and I can say screw that.  I just like his...  I like his views on separatism. 
[02:47:00]  It's pretty good.  Does it bother Farrakhan that his grandson is a bit on the white side, by the way?  Yeah, well, you know, only so much he could have done a few hundred years ago.  Farrakhan's grandson's a really good basketball player.  The Knicks are taking a look at him.  Plays for Virginia?  Mustafa Farrakhan Jr.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like an angry person.  Here's Farrakhan.  Do you think God would give his only begotten son for this world?  Think about it. 
[02:47:30]  Think about it, motherfucker.  Look at the world that you live in.  Yeah.  How rotten it is.  We voted for our brother.  Yep.  Barak.  Yep.  Beautiful human being with a sweet heart.  Uh-huh.  And now he's an assassin.  Oh, damn.  They've turned him.  They've turned him.  Into them.  Means white people, by the way.  You didn't hear me!  Oh.  Yes, we did. 
[02:48:00]  They turned him.  They turned him.  Did she actually say, yes, we did?  Yes, we did.  We heard you, little bugger.  See?  Yes, sir.  Oh, now he can stay in Buckingham Palace.  Nobody stayed there.  No.  Just a few presidents.  Why him?  Why?  I'll tell you why.  We know this enemy.  That's right.  That's right.  You're hurting my ears.  Love this guy.  Satan deceived the whole world.  Yep.  Satan. 
[02:48:30]  White people, by the way.  But you see, that's where he...  It's like...  Love that guy.  How about they turned him.  We know what you're saying.  I know, but he can say, no, I meant the government or the murderous ideology.  No, we know what he means.  We know what you're talking about.  That's like when I say they commit most of the crime.  We know.  It's like, how about...  It's like, come on, fucking Farrakhan.  Can you not just say that Obama is like every other politician?  Right.  It'd have to be they turned him.  This fucking...  It's always this place of responsibility passed off to the other. 
[02:49:00]  They turned him.  So I guess they turned Bush too.  But you weren't talking about Bush that way.  Bush is just one of them already.  Well, you weren't talking about Clinton that way.  Yeah, well, first black person, Bill Clinton.  They turned him.  They turned this brother.  Why don't you fucking stop it?  But he has a sweet heart.  He was never a brother.  Jimmy said many times.  But they turned him.  Sorry, I have a mouthful of food, but I love Jimmy's point. 
[02:49:30]  Obama's a nerd.  He's not a brother.  He's a nerd.  He's not a brother in the definition of brother.  He never was.  Farrakhan thought he was a brother.  All the black people that came out to vote with these illusions, these delusions that this  was going to be a whole other world for them of not paying bills.  Remember that one woman?  Now I don't have to worry about my gas payments and my mortgage.  Obama's in the house.  He's going to...  You can't be that stupid.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Nothing. 
[02:50:00]  I always knew the guy was a nerd.  Buckingham Palace.  Why he stay in Buckingham Palace?  To be brainwashed, that's when they made him sleep next to the bean pod.  They turned him.  Not he did it.  Not as commander-in-chief.  He is bloodthirsty.  He bought up into the power.  Right.  They turned him.  That's what's...  It is still...  Even a guy as smart as Farrakhan, that is still a fucking place of victimization.  Stop it.  You don't believe that he believes that, do you? 
[02:50:30]  I don't think Farrakhan believes that.  Yeah.  I think he does.  And he's a dummy.  Yes, he does.  Scotty in New York.  Scotty.  Yo, Opie, how can you say that you've never heard of Kirby Enthusiast?  Yeah, I've never heard of this show.  Are there people that are stupid?  Is this guy getting called or the...  I never heard of Kirby, man.  You never heard of...  What the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah, I just think this guy gets NASCAR tickets because you're a fucking idiot.  What?  I never heard of Kirby.  Who's in Kirby?  Larry David.  Larry David.  I don't know.  What did Larry David do?  I don't even know the name. 
[02:51:00]  Larry David produced Seinfeld.  I know Seinfeld.  Who was he in Seinfeld?  He wasn't in Seinfeld.  He produced it.  But it shows...  Then how would I know a producer?  George is based on him.  How could you not know Larry David?  I don't...  I really just don't know him.  I'm sorry.  I don't know him all.  Is he an up-and-coming guy or...  Is he an up-and-coming guy?  Yeah.  No, George.  Oh, shit.  I couldn't believe it either.  That's why I have to do that. 
[02:51:30]  The second half of Farrakhan.  See, America can sit down tyrants, but who will sit her down?  She puts her trust in her weapons of war.  She threatens the nations of the earth.  And here's my brother calling for the assassination of Brother Muammar Gaddafi.  What has he done?  I can defend that man.  You don't know that man.  I know that man.  See, you're a victim of that media that's controlled by satanic forces. 
[02:52:00]  The Jews.  The Jews.  Brings it down.  My poor brother.  Oh, my poor brother.  They're bombing.  They said they were only going over there for humanitarian reasons.  That's what I just said.  We're going to stop Gaddafi from killing his own people.  And we believe that.  Dummies.  You've been deceived.  We have been shucked, my brothers. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  You've been deceived.  I got to make a point.  I like listening to him.  It's true, though.  Can I make a point?  Oh, yeah.  Note to self.  Have Roland get your fucking food.  This kid knows how to make things tasty.  What is that?  It's an omelet.  It looks chock full of stuff.  Who gets your food, Jimmy?  Look at how nice that looks.  The mushrooms in there.  Mushrooms.  Peppers.  To spice it up.  A little spinach.  It's got a little tomatoes. 
[02:53:00]  And just enough Swiss cheese to bring it all together.  Just to make it congeal a bit.  Yeah.  You need it to congeal.  What do you mean?  The cheese part?  Stick it together.  Yeah.  Make it stick to the ribs.  And Farrakhan.  Sorry.  Oh, where is he?  Come on.  You guys really think he believes all that?  Yeah.  Yep.  I think he does.  That's the thing.  He's not like a Jesse Jackson or a Reverend Al. 
[02:53:30]  He really believes his shit.  Or is he using...  Pissed at fucking Obama.  I'd respect him more if he was using the language that he'd probably rather use.  Right, right, right.  Say Jews.  Say white people.  Stop trying to leave it.  Vague.  Vague.  They have turned.  But he really thought Obama was a brother?  Come on.  Or do you think he's using that for his own...  A little bit of both.  Obviously, his argument would be, if they pulled Barack over in a car, they would see him as 
[02:54:00]  they see me.  Right, right, right.  They would see you.  You see us that way.  We don't see ourselves that way.  I'm just talking to you in language that you...  You created...  All right.  Yeah.  Got it.  Gotcha.  Check, please.  Yeah, check.  Gotcha.  I think he's a showman.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But I do think he believes in a lot of this stuff. 
[02:54:30]  You do?  Maybe he embellishes.  What percentage?  He can't be all in.  Come on.  No, no.  No one's ever all in on anything they say.  Right.  I know that.  He believes more than he doesn't believe?  I'd put him at, I'd put him at a little over, probably 75%, 80%.  Wow.  Around there.  I do believe he, I think he believes that Obama has been infected by the white people  around him and the white system.  But he's not smart enough to know that every president will be affected by the system? 
[02:55:00]  No, he's smart enough, but he's not saying, I didn't think it would happen or he's just  saying this is what happened.  I think he believes it.  He's also religious.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a religious guy and they're a little more, that's kind of sad then, irrational,  I think, because of the religion aspect.  Meh.  Meh.  We move on to the Obama impersonator.  What does this guy do?  Why is this such a big deal?  The guy kind of looked like Obama, that's for sure.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  And then what, he was doing some racist shit?  I think so, yeah.  I haven't heard it.  Does he sound like him?  I don't know.  He kind of looks like...  Does he do these impressions?  Sounds like the real people?  He kind of looks like a rough version of Obama, look.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, yeah, he does.  He looks a little more gangster than Obama.  Yeah, a little bit, right?  A little more gangster.  A little more gangster.  Yeah, yeah.  Obama's retarded brother.  Like his younger brother.  Yeah, oh, he looks a little fruitier than that picture.  He looks like a little heart in the other one.  He has the personality captured. 
[02:56:00]  Food in my mouth.  Oh, you heard this, Jimmy?  No, no, no, I'm just looking at his photo.  Yeah.  This guy, Kyle Grooms, I know, does a great Obama voice.  He doesn't look like him, though.  Yeah, he's black, but he doesn't look like him.  Well, let's take a listen.  Obama impersonator makes race-related Obama jokes.  Time does fly when you're having fun.  We're more than halfway through June already.  Now, my favorite month is February.  Black History Month.  You see, Michelle, she celebrates the full month. 
[02:56:30]  And, you know, I celebrate half.  My wife.  This guy's going to wear the NASCAR tickets by a while.  My father was a black man from Kenya.  And my mother was a white woman from Kansas.  So, yes.  My mother loved a black man.  And, no, she was not a Kardashian.  Wow.  That's crazy.  It's topical. 
[02:57:00]  Who does he sound like?  Flip Wilson?  Early Richard Pryor?  Somebody that used to be on TV.  The sound quality and the laugh sound like that.  It sounds like, when you listen to it, it sounds like an old comedy record.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a weird quality that this was recorded on.  Might have been sounding a little like Richard Pryor before Richard Pryor decided to go all in with Edge and stuff.  This is a ballsy stuff, by the way.  Because you're talking about the president and it's the GOP convention.  Or GOP.  It was a Republican.  This wasn't a nightclub. 
[02:57:30]  I'm surprised they would hire a guy like that.  I wonder if they knew.  He did a lot of racial stuff, I think.  They were...  Was it New Orleans?  Yeah.  They were getting more upset, though, that he was making fun of GOP people, I think.  Oh, really?  Well, why weren't they?  By the way, we found out yesterday that Sam's Puerto Rican.  Let's not forget.  A little bit Puerto Rican.  Like, maybe half a percent, but I don't think much.  Something's in there.  If we knew how to read that actual dumb fucking thing. 
[02:58:00]  Who knew?  We were just speculating that that's what the percentages meant.  The highest percentage was Puerto Rican.  I don't think there was the highest non-white percentage.  No, it was pretty high, yeah.  A big mixture of whitey.  All over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would you hate if you were licking a vagina and it spoke, but it sounded like Al Del Vecchio?  What?  Yeah.  You feel like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you going to come soon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, how could you keep licking? 
[02:58:30]  And the clit was like his nose?  Oh, no.  That would be terrible.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Someone might be taking you to TASC, Ant.  What's the problem?  Let me see.  I don't know.  When Ant says he raises someone, how does he know he was talking about separatism?  Well, let's see what David has to say.  He's in Washington.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  Yo, what's up?  Hi, my friend.  What's slapping him?  Well, you just read the question. 
[02:59:00]  I'll repeat it, though.  When you were talking earlier about, yes, I agree with some of Farrakhan's shit.  Yeah.  How the fuck did I know that the next thing out of your mouth was going to be some shit  about, yeah, I agree with his views on separatism?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  You knew that?  See?  Because I...  Don't make it sound like a miracle that you knew that's what was going to come out of  my mouth.  If you listen to the show for however many years I've been on the air, I think I'm pretty...  I think my ideology is pretty much out there, isn't it? 
[02:59:30]  That's right.  You're a despicable racist, my friend.  Am I a despicable racist, or am I kind of a lovable racist?  I think I'm a little lovable.  There's some love in there, sir.  Despicable are people that go out, and a despicable racist would be someone that goes  out and does something horrible to people that they don't like based on color, religion,  whatever, race, like prevent them from getting jobs, or advocate violence against them or 
[03:00:00]  something.  How do I do...  What do I do anything but base...  You got me there.  All I do is...  You got me there.  Yeah, okay.  You got me there, but I do think that you were funnier, a funnier guy when you weren't  obsessed with race, i.e. before Obama happened.  So vote him out, and I'll be funny again.  That's all we got to do.  Anthony, funny again in 2012.  That's the campaign slogan. 
[03:00:30]  God, now we're all torn.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  All right.  That's funny.  Punch him out.  All right, my friend.  All right.  I don't know.  I've always been like this.  It's like when people go, dude, we're funnier during this, or this one, or remember when  Opie and Anthony, that...  Yeah, but I've always been this guy.  Don't worry about it.  You just didn't want anyone to know.  I haven't had a nervous breakdown and changed.  I'm the same fucking piece of shit I've been since I first hit the airwaves, and even  before that.  Thank you. 
[03:01:00]  You're just vocal about it now, right?  Yeah, a little more vocal, because I got...  The truth of the matter is, I got tired of the fact that no one else would speak up.  It was very rare that you heard people speak up in plain English, and not try to beat around  the bush, not try to protect themselves.  Once you stop trying to protect yourself from being called a racist, whether you are or not,  I'm not saying...  And when I call myself a racist, I'm not saying, hey, look at me, I'm a racist.  Just, you know, you could take what I say and interpret it yourself, but once you free 
[03:01:30]  yourself from the word, where if someone goes, you're a racist, and you go, I don't give  a fuck that you're calling me that, it opens it up where you could really just discuss things  more openly.  I don't mean be hateful or terrible, but you can have an open and honest discussion now  because you're not afraid of that label anymore.  It makes it easier to have an open discussion.  Yeah, I'm not crazy.  Thank you.  I'm just a racist.  You're talking to yourself. 
[03:02:00]  You gotta be crazy.  I know.  It's a microphone.  I assume there's people on the other end of this, but what the fuck am I...  What are you gonna do?  Phil from Rochester.  You were funnier before listeners thought they were hosts of the show.  That's another good one.  Oh, that's a hoot.  Phone show?  Yeah, you wanna do it?  Phone show.  Come on.  When are we doing our phone show?  Where's the phone show?  Today, actually, I think.  I love the phone show.  Oh, I mean, I hate it.  I wanna show people what a phone show could do.  Let's do it on Thursday to compete with the other phone show. 
[03:02:30]  No, me and I don't have to be here for that.  Oh.  That's what I'm getting at.  Friday should be phone show.  You wanna do it at 10 o'clock?  Oh, we leave.  If we do phone show, we don't have to be here.  10 o'clock?  That's the beauty of phone show.  We don't have to be here at 10 o'clock either, so why blow that?  You wanna do it from 6 to 10.  6 to 10 is phone show, right?  So who's gotta be here to pick up the calls?  You.  Add another show to your repertoire.  Oh, okay.  Second half of the Obama guy doing the racist thing. 
[03:03:00]  Okay.  Michelle Bachman.  Now, what can I say about Michelle Bachman that she hasn't already said about herself?  The other day, she called me a one-term president.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  That is too real.  What happened?  Uh, something was going on.  Let's go.  God bless you.  God bless the United States.  That was the controversy.  God bless America.  Thank you.  Oh, did they cut that out?  They potted the sound down, and then some guy came on stage while the sound was potted  down and put his arm around him and said, okay, you're done.  Oh, it brought him off stage.  It got uncomfortable.  He was up for like 15 minutes.  Are you sure that wasn't the app going crazy today?  No, yeah, no.  No?  That was real?  Oh, because he was goofing on the GOP? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, he was out there for like 20 minutes.  Oh, wow.  Wait, so they had no problem if he was making fun of Obama and Democrats,  but as soon as he went after a Republican, they red-lighted him?  That's what it seemed like.  Oh, boy.  I bet it was the race stuff.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's uptight about that shit.  Could have been that, too.  Someone call Wolf Blitzer.  We have a situation.  Yeah.  Situation.  Oh, boy.  Music bed, Wolf.  Get the music bed started, Wolf.  Graphics.  Very important.  Music.  Very important.  Lots of screens behind me. 
[03:04:30]  People coming and going.  Look at CNBC.  Wow.  Who the fuck enjoys McGurvey's pics?  It's McGurvey's pics.  Two-year, 100.2.7.  Switch five.  Two.  Canadian National.  First-cast.  I didn't scroll.  Scroll.  Goldbinders.  054 Capital One CLF.  Who the fuck can read all that shit?  Look at the big S&P 500 graph.  God, I fucking hate financial stuff.  Can every fucking channel stop trying to give me every bit of information?  This is what I picture an epileptic seizure would look like. 
[03:05:00]  That's what it would look like.  If you had to draw what an epileptic seizure is, that would be it right there.  Epileptic.  That would be.  Did I fuck it up?  Yeah, I fucked up that thing.  Who's the?  Who's the?  I stopped myself.  What?  I was going to say.  It was close to 10.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that would have been bad.  Sorry.  It's like a TV trying to be everything.  Just be TV. 
[03:05:30]  How about Dick of the Day award?  Will that help everybody out?  Dick of the Day?  Yeah.  Who gets that?  Hey, aren't we starting the line of the day thing in the 10 o'clock hour?  Yes, we will tomorrow.  Why don't we do it on this show?  We ought to do it at the end.  It was always a fun feature.  Or if we don't get to it, then it could be pushed over into the 10 o'clock hour.  We'll have it ready for whatever.  We heard you out there.  They want it back.  We're bringing it back.  I always liked that.  Yeah, I liked it, too.  It just needed to take a break.  Man urinates in water.  City flushes 8 million gallons of water.  That's kind of silly, but... 
[03:06:00]  It is silly, right?  It's a reservoir, right?  A 21-year-old man was caught on a security camera urinating into a city reservoir.  Oregon's biggest city is sending 8 million gallons of treated drinking water down to drink.  Treated.  8 million gallons.  So now, this was already treated?  See, that makes more sense.  But doesn't the government allow for all this shit?  Yeah, a little...  We used to do that bit on the radio.  Government allows you that.  No, you're allowed a certain amount of rat hairs and food...  Yeah, I've heard about that stuff.  ...and a certain amount of feces and this and that, because they can't completely control it. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  So they have figured out how much of that shit you could actually consume without it hurting you.  So if one guy's leaking 8 million gallons of water, yeah, it sounds disgusting,  but it would never affect you and you would never know.  You would never know in the end.  No, I don't know if it's...  It'd be so broken up.  If it's untreated, then it's got to go through treatment anyway.  Check the guy, make sure he doesn't have hep or anything, I guess.  But if it's like at a treatment plant and it's been, you know, it's in the aeration tank or something  and he's pissing in that, maybe there's a problem. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, but it's open air, right?  So isn't other shit falling into the water?  Yeah, you think like dead birds are falling in there and other animals are pissing and shitting in it?  Portland officials defended the decision Monday, so a lot of people are like,  what are you doing, man?  We need all the water we could get.  Saying they didn't want to send city residents water laced.  However, infinitesimally with urine.  Another word I have no idea.  Infinitesimally, yeah.  That's exactly what...  They know it's parts per million.  It means there's babies in the water. 
[03:07:30]  Yay!  I want to drink some of that!  Give me the chubby footed kid water.  It's like baby soup, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, he had like little chubby feet.  Go, go, go, go, go, go.  I don't even know what that is.  Don't even ask what it is.  He's begging you to ask him.  Don't do it, Ant.  Don't do it.  Never offers this up by himself.  He has to wait for you to ask.  Don't ask this time.  Please.  I know you're itching. 
[03:08:00]  What is that?  No, don't.  Public health officials say, however, that urine is sterile in healthy people and that  the urine in the reservoir was diluted.  Perhaps a half pint in millions of gallons.  A half pint in millions of gallons.  Well, it's ridiculous.  What do they do to this asshole?  Parts per million, man.  Again, because like you said, there's dirt birds falling in there. 
[03:08:30]  You want to know what they find?  Wow.  The reservoirs are drained twice a year to see what the fuck has landed in.  Yeah.  For cleaning.  And workers have found, are you ready for this?  And they're worried about this guy's lousy piss.  Right.  Piss.  Dead bodies.  Found animal carcasses.  Paint cans.  Oh.  Construction material.  Fireworks debris.  And even the plastic bags people use to scoop up after their dogs.  Yeah.  See?  But this guy pisses. 
[03:09:00]  This is a panic move.  Yeah.  Some fucking idiot made a panic move.  Not that I want pissy water in any way, shape, or form.  Dude, if it was a one gallon jug, fair enough.  But if you fucking take a piss in eight million gallons of water, however infinitesimal, that's  some OCD asshole.  Did that lad get in trouble?  Huh?  Did that lad get in trouble?  I didn't feel like reading that far, eh?  Really?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know if he got in trouble. 
[03:09:30]  This guy goes, nobody wants to drink pee.  I wouldn't say nobody.  Exactly.  We've had some pee drinkers on the show.  Yeah, there's been a couple.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Rogan wanted us to all drink our own pee.  Remember?  We couldn't do that one either.  No, there's no humiliation in that.  I would drink my own pee if other fucking people were drinking their own pee.  I wouldn't be the lone wolf on this one.  I'd do it on ice.  I'd do it on ice.  Be a little cool and refreshing.  I think that would make it worse.  I could not drink a piss unless I was dying of dehydration. 
[03:10:00]  I want mine to look frothy.  You want it to be foamy like a warm beer, like a Guinness?  Yeah.  Do you know what song was running through my head?  I'm not asking.  I'll tell you.  Because you said tea.  I was thinking of iced tea before.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was the Tetley Tea song for a long time.  I guess because I've been obsessed with Bill Tetley.  But I just kept thinking, I love those tiny little tea leaves.  Hey, Tetley Tea.  You got to go, ma, I love those tiny little tea leaves.  It was just, I love those tiny little tea leaves.  I love those.  Mailten.  No, it was like Don Meredith sang it or something. 
[03:10:30]  How many farts did he get out today?  Probably 41.  It was going on a pretty good rant about it.  I know.  It was just farting.  I hear it going, brr, brr, brr, brr.  I don't think everyone heard it.  As well, he should be.  I love those tiny little tea leaves.  So what do you think of all that shit in our water?  Ah.  Hmm.  That's what I say.  Nah.  Okay, here you go.  They figured it out.  Because people want to know.  The young man, Josh, told this TV station he'd been drinking, was with friends, and thought  that the reservoir was a sewage treatment plant.  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  He said he felt guilty instantly, and then security guards arrived.  I knew I did wrong when I did it, he told the station.  So I don't think you can find this guy.  No.  Maybe for taking out your dick in public or whatever.  That's a panic move by Portland.  They overreacted.  Maybe if it was the underarm hair of a hippie girl, they probably would have left it in  there.  Man.  They love that.  It's natural.  Done again, so do I.  Syringes from heroin addicts.  They love that too.  Do they?  Yeah.  They're all stupid.  I love those tiny little tea leaves.  Nah, Tetley.  Yeah, Tetley too. 
[03:11:30]  Nah, Tetley.  I think Don Meredith sang that.  That was so annoying.  Oh, Don.  Dandy Don?  I want to know who sang that.  I fucking hate the Tetley T song.  Did Dandy Don Meredith sing that one?  I don't remember.  Do you remember the commercial I mean?  Yeah.  I do.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  No, I really do.  I wouldn't know the words offhand.  Do you remember Ant?  Yeah.  Oh, Ant remembers all that shit.  I remember that one.  I love those tiny little tea leaves.  Yeah, but it was the way he sang it was like, I love those tiny little tea leaves.  Ant, Tetley T. 
[03:12:00]  I just remember that version.  I want to say it was Don Meredith.  Are you Googling Don Meredith?  I checked.  No, it's not Bill Tetley.  Oh, I know.  I know.  It's stuck in my head though.  Wah, Bill Tetley.  Wah, Bill Tetley.  It's different.  Wah.  Wah.  Tommy Central canceled Norm's show.  Already?  Yeah.  Wow, they don't cancel anything.  They didn't give it a shot.  His sports show's going by.  I heard it was great.  I heard it was good too.  Bunch of assholes over there. 
[03:12:30]  Norm's a weird guy.  Was it over complaints or was it over ratings?  Did they say?  I would assume over ratings.  Just because it's sports.  I really didn't know anybody that watched it, to tell you the truth.  You watched it there, Travis?  Not anyone that cares then.  Was it good?  I knew no one that really mattered that watched it.  That's not nice.  How was it?  Did you like it?  It was, it had its moments.  What didn't you like about it?  Yeah.  I think some of the segments were kind of forced. 
[03:13:00]  Like?  Like he had a segment called, like, you know, What the H?  And, like, while the segment itself was good, there was no need to name it and make  it about, what's the H?  What the, like, oh, is that like, what the hell?  Yeah.  Uh, I mean, he had some really funny jokes.  Could be what the heck.  Yeah.  He had some really funny jokes, but, I mean, I just don't think I found it.  It's.  Hullabaloo.  Well, that would be what's the.  What the.  What the.  You want another good story? 
[03:13:30]  Please.  Cops.  Another would be, I'd make an assumption that by saying another, you meant there were some  entertaining stories before this one.  Yes.  Oh, so far, so good.  You should say, would you like your first good story of the day?  Yes.  All right.  Is this a good one?  Cops.  Drunk.  Naked man.  Operated on Pet Doberman.  Wow.  And this is in our neighborhood, Jimmy.  Alerted by reports of a naked man covered in blood.  Police rushed to a near West Side apartment. 
[03:14:00]  Found a highly intoxicated man who had been operating on his pet Doberman.  Foley.  Officials say.  Doing an operation on him?  This dude's 44, charged with felony cruelty to an animal late Sunday after he told police  he had tried to remove a cyst from under the dog's right ear, according to police.  Hey, man.  Vet bills are very expensive.  I don't blame him.  So what was he doing?  This guy for trying to do this.  Bail was set at $75,000.  There you are.  Fucking pissed at this guy.  And all he was doing was trying to take care of his dog.  How many people know about it?  Well, Gibbs' landlord got a call from other tenants in the building who said water was 
[03:14:30]  leaking into their apartments from the ceiling, according to whatever.  The landlord knocked on Gibbs' door, got no response, let himself in.  Gibbs then ran toward him naked and covered in blood.  Landlord also saw a blood-soaked towel in the apartment before he left to call police.  His hands were covered in blood.  He was highly intoxicated.  Jeez.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  Dog okay?  No.  Right? 
[03:15:00]  I don't know.  I didn't read that far.  Oh, okay.  Do you want me to read that far?  Nah, I could give a shit.  What are you looking at, Sam?  Trump Tower.  He might be one of our neighbors.  Oh, yeah.  They give an address?  No.  There's a lot of Trump fucking towers down that way.  He's real close to us.  Yeah.  Sam apparently found a YouTube thing.  It's got commercials from the 70s in it.  It's a montage.  I remember all of these.  But they don't have the Tetley T's on it.  No, not the Tetley T's on it.  Did you do YouTube John Meredith Tetley T? 
[03:15:30]  Of course I did.  And what did it come up?  Nothing.  It's not true.  Do it again.  All right.  Fucking liar.  What's this about, though?  This could be kind of cool.  Oh, there's some old ones.  Is that a commercial?  Yeah.  I saw some old ones.  How long is this piece?  I saw some old ones.  Nine minutes?  It's too long.  Nah.  If you look at the clock, it's not.  You might be just right.  It could be perfect.  What are they for?  Just play one that we know.  Where's the one with the Asians?  Go to the Asians.  Yeah.  Do we have our escape route planned out yet?  Yeah.  We do? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Which way are we going today?  I'm going this way immediately.  No, no, no, no.  Immediately.  Okay.  Do it like we're doing a play in the school yard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Football play.  What are you thinking?  Yeah.  I'm thinking...  Dude, they're going to...  Quick.  Quick.  And then break left hard.  They're going this way today and cutting that way.  I guarantee it.  But the trick is I can't meet them at that intersection, so we've got to move.  We've got to hustle.  But if we cut down this way, complete the trick.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because then you've got the whole distance between fucking Yonville or Yon... 
[03:16:30]  No, we're not in Yonville until past that guardrail.  Yeah, but they can see us.  But if we could get past that...  No, the second I make this turn, I'm out of their view.  They cut through, though, waiting on the other side.  They do.  But I go fast.  But we could flank.  But if I go fast, they won't get through there until we're gone.  The only way for them to do it is send one boss each way.  Yeah, yeah.  Are we allowed to do the Howard out?  The elevator?  Sort of?  I don't know.  Down one floor?  Oh, I don't think so.  Oh, is that what he does? 
[03:17:00]  I have no idea how he leaves.  Yeah, I don't want to give away his...  But are we allowed to...  Is there any way we'd go that way?  Not all the way down, but just to kind of, like, confuse everybody?  I don't know if you can get away with it.  Pop out somewhere else?  Maybe up...  What if you shut the curtains on the studio and lock the door, and then you just stay for  the after show?  You know what the beauty is?  What?  This is a recording.  We're already gone.  We did this this morning.  What a trick.  All right, let's go. 
[03:17:30]  You want to watch the Asian Tetley Tea commercial?  No, I mean...  Yes!  Is it Tetley Tea Asian commercial?  Yeah, but it wasn't the whisk.  All right, let's go.  Let's hear this.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Here's a commercial for Tetley Tea.  Let me see.  There's more demanding about our tea than we English.  Mr. Miyagi.  We expect a cup of tea to have the kind of flavor one family gets from Tetley's tiny little  tea leaves.  Curious how others can call us English code people with all this hot Tetley Tea running 
[03:18:00]  through our veins?  No, really.  Tetley, the number one teabag in England.  What a terrible commercial.  What do you call an Asian tea draker?  Asian?  No, and Sam, I didn't mean that one.  I meant the whisk commercial with the Asians.  I hate dealing with kids that don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  Yeah, I know!  How old were you in 1971, Sam? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, Sam.  That you don't know this.  Negative 12?  Keep going.  Click, click, click.  Let me see.  Wait, he was...  Click, click.  Keep going.  Did you hear that?  Hold on, hold on.  There it is.  No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He was negative 12 in 1971.  Was he?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  He was negative 12.  Negative 12.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Were you really negative 12?  No, no.  I was born in 83.  Oh, my God.  What's that one?  Let's play it.  Oh, I thought it was Ancient Chinese Secret.  Travis, what do you got?  This is a present for Jim.  What the hell is this? 
[03:19:00]  A present for me?  Fan mail from some flounder?  A while back, Jim asked for something from sales.  Oh, cool.  Is that true?  Yes.  What is it?  Did he mean it facetiously?  What is that?  Holy Jesus Christ.  What is it?  That is a giant box of condoms.  Wait, that's completely filled with Trojans?  I didn't ask for these.  Mrs. Eric Nagel says that you asked for them a while ago.  No, here's what was going to happen.  Oh, no. 
[03:19:30]  Here's what was going to happen.  Everyone knows that Jimmy doesn't use rubbers.  I didn't know what they were.  I'm like, what are Trojans?  There are four dozen packages in there.  Each one has four huge boxes.  Wait, do the math.  I'm not magnums.  Do the math.  How many rubbers?  How many pieces of pussy would you be able to get with this?  There's 280 condoms.  All right, let's have a party.  No, I'll tell you why I didn't need these.  It was going to be for, they were going to sponsor something. 
[03:20:00]  Let's see what.  I was going to do live reads for them.  Can I see one?  This is the, um.  But it never happened.  Oh, these are the ones that kind of expand at the end.  Right.  That way your dick is all loosey-goosey inside the rubber.  The rubber doesn't hug tight to your schlong.  Right.  It's got the loosey-goosey part that kind of goes,  and rubs your dick.  It goes,  Yeah, but where are the ones for, uh.  So it prevents your penis from looking like a pinhead? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't have the little pinhead, but it looks like it's, uh.  No, I mean, you know, how it squishes everything down.  Yeah, but it looks like your penis has been scalded,  and the skin's hanging off of it.  Yeah, where you look like a sharpened pencil all the time.  Yeah.  Right, right, right, right.  I'm a man who needs to get himself a little pussy.  Wow, this is a lot of fucking rubbers.  Yeah, well, I need a lot of rubbers.  Why, Jim?  Because I'm going to be sticking my piece of meat  into a whole bunch of different pussies.  Is that going to be on the Variety Hour? 
[03:21:00]  Oh, on the Bill Tettley Variety Hour?  Yeah.  No, they don't take sexual sponsors.  Dual action.  That's too bad.  Yeah.  What's dual action mean?  Ribbed for her pleasure.  There's, uh.  Dual action lubricant.  Uh, warming and tingling sensation for both partners.  Ew.  His ass and his penis.  Tapered at the base for a secure fit.  Lubricated inside and out for a more natural feel.  I want to wear Magnum XLs.  I want to put one on and then jump and watch it just fall on the floor. 
[03:21:30]  That's humiliating.  Falls off like a hat that's too big.  Like a hat that's too big.  Ah, there we go.  Oh, let's crack one of these open.  Let's see what this is all about.  Let's put them on.  Yeah, let's all put them on each other.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  This looks nice.  This is cool.  Look at this.  That's right.  You better run.  All lubricated.  Ew.  Wah, wah, wah. 
[03:22:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Anthony's rolling down his finger.  It really is.  It looks like a...  It's very lubricated.  Come on!  It's really wet.  Anthony's pulling it all the way down.  Yes.  Why is it wet, Jimmy?  Why would they make it so wet?  I don't really understand.  It's probably because what happens is it gets too dry.  Then all of a sudden you need, like, extra lubrication from the pussy! 
[03:22:30]  Ew.  That's pretty cool, though.  This thing is really...  God, I wish my fucking cock would have filled that out.  See, it's bigger at the end because then your dick slides around in it and you don't  feel like just that it's in a balloon.  I've heard about those condoms.  Ew, now I've got lube all over me.  I'm going to have to masturbate.  Shake some...  No, you ought to shake someone's hand and imagine it with that.  There you go.  What's that on your hand?  Something you don't put on your dick during the contract negotiations. 
[03:23:00]  You fuck.  Exactly.  See, get it?  I got it up the ass with no lube.  And it's hurt.  It sure does.  That's why it's tough to have a relationship.  Yeah.  Bring it back to the beginning of the show.  All right, so when we get back, we're going to have to wrap this up for today.  Hang on.  We have one more story.  Hang on.  One more story.  I've got to go sign.  Hang on.  I've got lease papers with lubricant on my hands.  I've got to wash.  We have one more story for after the break.  We have to do a live read and then come back to the show.  Yeah, I know.  We're coming back.  Don't worry. 
[03:23:30]  Good.  I don't know if I should wait around for her to come today.  I'm going to take a home.  Who?  Cameron Diaz.  It's a long time.  Give yourself a break from that whole thing.  No, it's fun.  It's two hours, though.  You have to wait two hours?  Well, she's not here as well.  Oh, I see.  Why don't you come back?  Yeah, once I'm home.  What the fuck is this?  I'll be tugging my dick.  Yeah.  I'm going to tug my dick.  Am I supposed to now just sit here and say like a Quiznos sandwich is something you don't  eat because you have to.

[03:25:00]  Was that good, though?  You got to go toasty.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Toasty.  That sounded a little too ethnic.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  I like that one.  Toasty.  It's very gentle.  Mm-mm-mm.  Toasty.  No, you didn't separate them.  You don't have to separate them.  It says separate them.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Pronounced as five separate M's.  Yeah.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  Toasty.  Oh, that's perfect.

It was dropped off a building onto her head, Sam.  There was deliciousness all over.  She was mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Yeah.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  Toasty, Sam.  It's a delicious sandwich.  Tell Detective Monaghan to stop eating my Quiznos sandwich.  He's getting his fat cop fingers all over it. 
[03:26:00]  He's got gun oil on his fingers.  He's ruining my sandwich.  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  I do enjoy a Quiznos.  Yes, who doesn't?  Quiznos is nice, toasty.
