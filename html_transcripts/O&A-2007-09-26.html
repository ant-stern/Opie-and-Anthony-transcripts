<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their deliberately controversial style, rejecting the expectation of "nice" radio.  The show then launched into "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday," featuring caller accounts of their outrageous wake-up methods. These included using a (safely distanced) "quarterstick" of dynamite, throwing dog feces, dropping a 25-pound cat, and noisy banging with a pot and spoon.  One caller, Eric, was kicked in the chest and face by his spouse after dropping his drawers; another, Jeremy, violently woke his ex-girlfriend.

Following this, professional wrestler The Iron Sheik called in, delivering a rambling, incoherent message denying the existence of homosexuals in Iran, laced with expletives and nonsensical phrases.  Several clips of this call were replayed, prompting a proposed contest to edit the audio to make him appear supportive of homosexuality.

The hosts then moved on to mocking Bill O'Reilly, replaying clips from his show and fabricating humorous, sexually suggestive anecdotes about his grandmother's alleged fondness for Black men, contrasting it with his comments about a Harlem restaurant.  They criticized O'Reilly’s perceived hypocrisy and journalistic integrity, comparing him unfavorably to TMZ.  This transitioned into a discussion of the Oscar De La Hoya leaked photos scandal, playing audio from the Russian stripper who leaked them, and criticizing a Vegas morning show’s “Britney Got Fat” segment.  This segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe, promoting his book "The Heroin Diaries," discussing his past addiction, recovery, and the band's history.  The interview included a humorous anecdote about a backstage Motley Crüe game involving a double-ended marital aid nicknamed the "wiffle ball bat."  Howie Mandel then joined the show, discussing his Hidden Hills neighborhood and his OCD.

The show continued with further discussion of Sixx's book, including a caller sharing his own addiction struggles and Sixx offering advice. The hosts also announced their upcoming studio move, discussed listener feedback and calls (including the dynamite-related wake-up call), and the "phantom vibrate" phenomenon.  A significant portion of the show involved playing a series of extremely graphic and sexually explicit old-time radio-style pornographic audio clips, featuring exaggerated descriptions of sexual acts and offensive language.  A caller, Jim, shared a story about his grandmother's involvement in making audio porn.  Lee Abrams from XM joined the show, discussing the decline in media quality and integrity, criticizing MTV, local news, and the lack of originality in radio programming.  The conversation touched on the enduring appeal of Pink Floyd.  The explicit audio clips continued to be played throughout this segment.

Further sexually explicit audio clips were played, punctuated by an unexpected XM Satellite Radio emergency alert system test, which disrupted the broadcast and prompted angry commentary from the hosts.  The hosts discussed listener submissions for future explicit audio clips, including "Fornicating Female Freaks," "Apartment 69," "Sex Love Story," and "Dr. Kaufman examines Crystal," with credit given to Jeff from Virginia for providing links. The show concluded with more commentary on the explicit audio and the interruption.  The recurring motif of playful antagonism towards Bob Edwards, an NPR personality, and a short, humorous sports update featuring a blooper reel were also included throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  The controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put 380 in my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like a transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This old gag. 
[00:01:30]  Is the show on the road?  This old gag.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  A big hi to the early risers.  What is that?  Is that new?  What?  What?  I don't know.  It's that long piece of equipment.  What is that?  What is that, E-Roc?  I don't know.  Has it?  What is it?  The emergency alert system. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, okay.  Good thing it's pointing to where we can't see it.  Yeah.  It's kind of distracting.  Oh, is it?  Stuff starts scrolling across, letting you know they're like tornado or bad weather and  stuff.  Tornado?  Okay.  Ah, whatever.  I was just curious.  I thought it was one of those things where Opie could type out like, you're stupid and  you'd read it.  No?  Okay.  Poor E-Roc.  Well, let's get one of those immediately.  Hey, our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning to everybody on Pal Talk.  Good morning to everyone ready to send us some instant feedback through the website.  How do they get instant feedback?  You could get a widget.  Do you have a widget?  Is it on our regular website?  Probably.  You know, the website that is named after the show?  But we can't say it.  I think you could get there.  And then there's, like, if you've got a Mac, you could make a widget. 
[00:03:00]  It's a little widget.  It goes up on your monitor and then you just type in and send.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's right there.  All right.  Hello, everyone on Pal Talk.  I think I got in the Pal Talk, the Opie and Anthony fan room last night, which is, it's at the top of the list every evening.  Very proud.  A lot of people in there every night.  Just, and a lot of times you go in there, they don't discuss the show or anything, which is great.  It's fine. 
[00:03:30]  It's just fun to listen to what they're talking about.  Sometimes I pop in and no one really knows I'm in there for a while and I'll just hear them just screaming about anything that's going on.  And so I just keyed the mic down and went on a rant about my stupid camera again and how it won't work with my computer.  And I actually took my Logitech Orbit camera and took it off the computer completely, uninstalled it, and then installed the old disk that I got with it. 
[00:04:00]  No upgrades, no nothing.  Because then people tell you, you know, well, you can't upgrade it.  All right.  I uninstalled Pal Talk, reinstalled it.  Still, when I try to cam up, I get that stupid error message that you, would you like to report this?  Do you want to report?  Do you want to rat out that program that's really getting you mad?  Click here.  And then you see it's sending report and you don't know where it's going or what it's doing. 
[00:04:30]  I would love to see that pile of reports.  There's no one paying attention when you hit yes.  It's just something to do and you're really mad.  Because 99% of the time you just click no, no.  But sometimes you're like, yes, I need to.  I have to report this.  I need to rant.  You're like a safety patrol in school.  Right.  I'm reporting you for running in the hallways.  Get all mad.  So I reported it. 
[00:05:00]  But still, I cannot get on Pal Talk.  I can't cam up.  Wait, E-Rock is telling me it's to rat yourself out if you're running an illegal copy of the operations system?  That's how they get you?  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it because you're sending information from your computer to some other computer.  Why the hell would you want to do that?  Yeah.  It's just they wait for you to get so frustrated that you hit that button.  Yes, I'm reporting.  And then they get back to you and go, hey, wait a minute.  By the way, you're not a registered user of that program.  Bof.  Maybe that's the problem. 
[00:05:30]  Maybe that's why I can't cam up.  We have a Logitech rep stopping by today.  Oh, really?  We?  Buddy of mine.  Well, he's a buddy of mine who's doing something.  Well, I'll have something to say to him.  You just scared me.  I'm like, how bad has this show gotten that we have a Logitech rep?  Yeah, let's talk about that.  Oh, wow.  That's just as good as having Nikki Sixx come in today.  What type of lens do you use?  How is your lens made?  I'm like, what?  Did we turn it to NPR all of a sudden?  We're going to discuss camera lens for two straight hours. 
[00:06:00]  I was listening to the replay yesterday and the part with Bob Edwards being a vampire and  how he just falls into being a bunch of rats and scurries away.  Yeah.  Well, Bob Edwards for...  Dude, that made me laugh so hard, Jimmy.  For the people that don't know is an NPR star that XM hired.  And he's just a ghoul that walks the hallways down there in Washington at the XM compound.  And how he took care of the rat problem.  Yeah.  They just opened up a little hole in his studio and he sticks his head in and bites the rats 
[00:06:30]  and eats them.  In half.  That had me laughing so hard during the replay.  I wish I'd let people know, yes, they had a massive rat problem down there in Washington.  And Bob Edwards has never said a bad word about the Opie and Anthony show or anyone associated  with this show, but we just beat him up at any chance we could guess.  Or a good word.  That's his problem.  Yeah.  Or a good word.  Guy just walks the hallways like a ghoul and goes outside and smokes a lot at me.  Have you noticed when he looks into the other studios, you cannot see his reflection in 
[00:07:00]  the windows.  He got fang marks on his mic.  All right.  Here's the deal.  I got to interrupt you, Anthony, because today's the big day.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes.  We'll talk about that a little later.  It's also Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday, and we got some doozies today, man.  We got Brittany Got Fat.  We got Party Like a Lohan. 
[00:07:30]  And there's another one around here, too.  Also, it's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Now this.  And that's why I had to interrupt you, because we got three really good ones standing by.  Yeah.  This is my favorite day of the week thing.  Finally, something that makes sense.  It's fun.  And it's audience participation.  It's not one of these ridiculous ones that we always come up with.  Right.  Why don't we go right to Jared? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, because I've been reading this one, and I don't know how this is going to be done.  Hey, Jared, what's up?  Jared.  You mean Jerry?  Oh, Jerry.  Jerry.  It's my pride and joy, Jerry.  You keep that.  I got a stick of dynamite.  You got a what?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, sir.  God, you got to know how to do radio.  You just don't casually go, I got a stick of dynamite.  I'm going to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We got to slow you down a little bit.  Jerry, you got a stick of dynamite? 
[00:08:30]  Quarterstick.  Oh, quarterstick.  Okay.  What is that?  Like a couple M80s?  Yeah, it's a little more than an M80.  How many M80s is that?  What's the old school M80?  A couple, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay.  And you want to wake her up with that.  How are you going to do it?  Where are you going to put it?  Inside a pot, so she doesn't get hurt, but it'll be loud.  And how close are you going to put it to her?  Right next to her on the bed.  No, I wouldn't put it right next to her. 
[00:09:00]  What, like the night table?  Dude, it's going to be so loud anyway.  Why don't we have to show responsibility?  I know.  Put it on the floor if you're going to do this.  I think it's going to be loud enough if you even had it in the other room.  Yeah.  Don't put it next to her.  I'll do it in the other room.  No, you can put it on the floor.  All right.  But away from her.  Like across the room.  Yeah.  All right, right now?  That would, like, kill her.  I'm just letting you know.  She's a cursor, so get ready.  All right.  Well, get the phone close to her, all right? 
[00:09:30]  The key to wake up your spouse Wednesday, we need to hear the waking up part.  Yeah, so put the phone near her.  All right?  Even though she's sleeping.  All right.  Jerry, the show is yours.  Go ahead.  What is it?  Oh, my God!  You all right?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Rich, you all right?  No, get away from me.  It's not Wednesday.  Get away from me.  You're on the O&A show.  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  All right, guys.  I've got to do some damage control.  Damage control.  You're in stride.  All right, guys.  Because he put the phone near her, and she's probably like, what is that?  Boom.  Oh, that was a good one. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, that was a fine and dandy one.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Yeah.  He's in for a long and irritating day.  Frankie.  Damage control from that.  I've got to hear that again.  Yeah.  Get the guys to get that for me immediately.  That's a good one.  Immediately.  Let's say hi to Eric in Buffalo.  Listening on the edge there.  Eric, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I don't know if you're going to beat that, but what do you got today?  Yeah, that was a good one.  Oh, man.  Jerry is insane. 
[00:11:00]  Mm-hmm.  I could add a little something to it.  I think I'm going to just go in there and scream frunkus as loud as I can, but I could  also get like a mini lamp and do it naked.  I prefer the naked.  I think naked is always better.  Yeah.  And frunkus, for the people that don't know, is a word that Jimmy made up that drives a  lot of people just crazy.  It's a great little battle cry.  Yeah.  He even has frunkus t-shirts.  We don't even know what it means.  And it has to be said just the right way.  It's from the Latin word, to frunk.  To frunk. 
[00:11:30]  Jimmy, why don't you give us a frunkus?  You haven't done it in a while.  I can't do it too loud because it's too early.  You can't do a loud before 7 a.m.  Okay.  Frunkus.  Frunkus.  Frunkus.  Frunkus.  Sweet one.  That's a sweet one.  That's the type you get while making love.  Like there's frunkus.  You got to trill that R.  Yeah, there's things over the R.  Right?  What are those things?  Oh, the things that like in Spanish words we'll have over it.  What are they called?  The tilde.  Yes, there's tildes, but only over the F.  All right, Eric, what do you got?  Let's see.  Make some of the N's for the.  All right.  Now, let me tell you something about. 
[00:12:00]  Eric.  Yeah.  Learn from Jerry.  Jerry got the phone next to the person that is actually waking up because we've been doing  this bit for three or four weeks and some of the ways people are waking up their  spouse or roommate or whatever, really creative, but you don't hear the person waking up because  the phone's not close enough.  So you got to put the phone near them.  I will get it right there for you.  Don't worry.  Okay.  All right, Eric from Buffalo, everyone.  Okay.  I'll drop my drawer before I do it.  Okay. 
[00:12:30]  Here he goes.  I mean, that wasn't nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  She said that wasn't nice. 
[00:13:00]  What happened?  Oh, Eric's gone.  He's gone.  She probably hit him.  Did he even get the word out?  He started laughing.  He started laughing too much.  She must have freaked out.  But then I just heard it go.  That wasn't nice.  All right.  All right.  It's just something about these poor girls being woken up horribly.  Yeah.  Eric, why don't you give us a call back?  I want to see how that worked out for you.  Okay, let's go to Jeremy in Georgia.  Jeremy.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy. 
[00:13:30]  I think we're going to have to be careful with this one, the way you word it.  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  You want to wake up your roommate?  It's a her?  Yeah, this is my ex-girlfriend.  She's actually moving out today.  All right.  She's moving out today.  And you want to wake her up by hitting her with a part of your body that can flap around  a little bit and be used like a little club.  Yeah, let's just leave it at that.  Okay, we'll leave it at that.  And that's what you want.  Where are you going to hit her with it?  In the face.  Okay. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Where else would you hit somebody?  Exactly.  All right.  Make sure the phone is down there by her face along with that.  Yeah.  And give her a few smacks.  Go ahead.  Wake up your spouse Wednesday.  In effect, Jeremy from Georgia.  I'm going in.  Wake up your spouse Wednesday. 
[00:14:30]  Get up.  I don't think you like this.  Will you take care of that?  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  Let's go back to Eric in Buffalo.  That was pretty good.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys want to know what happened? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  All we know is that you pulled down your whatever.  You walked in the room.  You started to say frunkist.  And you started cracking up uncontrollably.  What happened?  Oh, she started booting me right away in the chest and started kicking me.  Maggie, you want to say hi to one?  Oh, come on.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Hey, Eric. 
[00:15:30]  Eric, you did all right, man.  Oh, come on, honey.  Say hi to one.  She's mad.  She just kicked me in the face.  I go.  Are you sure you don't want to say hi?  No.  Hi.  She just said hi, guys.  All right.  Very cool.  Well, thank you, Eric.  All right.  A lot of people saying they didn't believe that one that we did the last one we heard.  What?  Where he smacked her with a part of his body.  At first, I thought he was doing the girl's voice, but then it was obvious to me that 
[00:16:00]  it was her.  Yeah.  Like, at first, the scream was like, oh, that sounds weird.  But then, like, as Dan pointed out, everyone turns into a nine-year-old when they're woken  up.  And that's kind of, like, the scream was a little weird, but then she was like, eh.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  I don't think that was fake.  And Steve thinks it was, so it means it wasn't.  Of course.  All right.  Steve thinks she's a lucky girl to be woken up that way. 
[00:16:30]  He's trying to buy an alarm clock that will do the same thing.  Do you guys want to do one more?  An alarm clock named Brad.  Do you guys want to do one more?  It's not called a clock, though.  It's going to take a letter out.  All right.  We'll do one more.  It's Tim in Wisconsin.  Tim, it's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  No, this can't work.  Come on.  Tim.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  All right.  Listen.  Now, you've got to get the phone near her.  All right.  No, I'll set it down on the nightstand.  I just came in from outside. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let Anthony explain what you're about to do.  Now, I can't buy this.  I can't buy.  You're going to wake her up by throwing something you find in your yard.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Something the dog leaves out in the yard.  Yeah, used food.  Yeah, used food.  You're going to throw that at her?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  I was going to use mine, but I'm not feeling good.  But isn't that going to, um, like, ruin your bed?  Oh, no. 
[00:17:30]  It's in a bag.  Oh, it's in a bag.  Okay.  So you bagged it up.  Now that makes sense.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Throw the bag of whatever.  These guys are getting creative, man.  At her.  And put the phone by her.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a real light sleeper, so we've got to be careful.  Okay.  Right.  Let's go.  Okay.  We're going up the stairs.  Wake up. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  Well, it got thrown back at me and then fell on the carpet.  I got some work to do here.  She didn't say anything.  All right.  Not everyone.  She just.  Not every one of these is going to be a home run, but.  I can't believe you couldn't hear that look.  Not a bad 20 minutes of radio, though, man.  I really like this concept.  I think the listeners like it, too, because they've been waiting all week to do it. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And we changed it to Wednesday, and the listeners were even aware of that, so.  We had five or six standing by as soon as we walked in today.  We got a girl.  That's kind of cool.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Tim.  You bet.  All right.  And this is a good typical.  This is a nice old school way.  Yeah.  We got to let the girls in on this a little bit.  Diane, Tennessee.  What's up?  Diane from Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Okay.  What's up?  I have a big pot and a big metal spoon, and I want to wake up my boyfriend.  That's good.  Is he a fan of the show?  I'm sorry? 
[00:19:00]  Is he a fan of the show?  Does he listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Does he?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Not as much as I do.  Okay, good.  All right.  Make sure you hit that pot hard, then.  Yeah.  Really bash him.  And get the phone near him.  Yeah.  Get the phone near his face while he's still asleep, and then pound it.  All right.  Give me a second to get in there and put the phone down.  Okay.  Scott M.  I'm from HopHog.  Isn't throwing dog poo going to ruin your bed?  How about isn't throwing dog poo going to ruin your relationship?  Yeah.  Yeah.  True. 
[00:19:30]  And the carpet.  All right.  Here's Diane.  All right.  She's going in the room.  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!  Wake up!  You're such an asshole.  I guess you heard that.  Oh, we heard it.  Yeah.  He had a little potty mouth there.  They had a dump out, but...  Called her the A-H word.  We heard it.  Good morning, boys.  Bye.  Hey, thank you, Diane. 
[00:20:00]  You're welcome.  We have time to do one more.  Pete in New York.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Pete, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Pete.  Um, oh, I got a 25-pound cat here.  What?  He's just really overly fat.  And I'm going to drop it on my woman.  You're going to drop the big, fat cat on your woman?  Oh, yeah.  I'm 6'4", too, so when I hold my hands above my head, it's going to be pretty far dropped. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Just don't hurt her.  Don't hurt the cat, either.  Yeah.  I have a cat, Jack Jack.  Oh, my God.  Shut the up.  Did you find him?  A lot of people.  No, no, I didn't.  Hold on.  Steve from Bayshore gave him to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, Pete.  All right.  A little white.  A little white paw.  Hold on.  So cute.  All right.  I'm going to friggin' kill you. 
[00:21:00]  Did you hear?  Well, I heard the big thud.  I heard something, but she wasn't very angry.  They're not all going to work.  I'm going to freaking kill you.  No, I kind of liked it, actually.  Not everyone is going to be the huge reaction.  But, you know, you're getting...  I'm getting framed at.  What?  Oh, I got to work in a couple of hours.  Here, it's ONA.  It'll be neat.  Say hi.  Say hello to the guys.  Hi.  Good morning. 
[00:21:30]  Good morning.  Wakey, wakey.  It's time to wake up.  Wakey, wakey.  You got to get to work.  I don't want to.  Wakey, wakey.  Wake up.  Wake up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Wake up.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  You're right.  People just turn into nine-year-olds.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  We have to play.  This is...  The one that started it all this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Let's replay it right away. 
[00:22:00]  A guy using dynamite.  Using a quarter stick.  It's pretty much an M80.  You know what I liked about the wake-ups today?  Very, very creative.  Yeah.  People coming up with some creative ones.  We have an M80, and we got dog stuff in a bag.  Good luck to people trying to do this next week.  Good luck to you, because they got real creative today.  Here's the dynamite guy.  What is it?  Oh, my God! 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God!  What's that?  And boom.  Because she probably saw somebody being lit.  Yeah.  What's that?  Kaboom.  Is that a candle?  Is he being romantic?  That's great.  All right.  We have to take our first break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:23:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  A big hi to all the women on Pal Talk.  It's a great morning, man.  I got to tell you.  The women on Pal Talk are wowing like crazy.  Yes.  We've had a great Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday so far.  The dynamite.  Wow! 
[00:23:30]  We're going to replay that whole phone call in about another, I don't know, a half hour or so.  I like that one.  And then we got Morning Zoo bits of the day, and we got a doozy, man.  And we're just trying to hold off until 7 o'clock.  We're just trying to hold off until 7 o'clock.  So hard to do.  Very hard to do.  I was just handed pictures of the zoo crews that we'll be profiling, I guess, today.  Yeah.  Some of their bits-eses.  Bits-eses.  Bits-eses.  And the pictures. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait till you hear Britney Got Fat.  Yeah.  Wait till you hear Britney Got Fat.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And let's not forget, and boom goes the dynamite.  Yes.  And boom goes the dynamite.  The Indiana Pacers are looking for a measure of revenge tonight against the New Jersey Nets,  and to strengthen their playoff hopes.  The Nets won the last Sunday's matchup, 94-85, which left the Pacers one game behind the Chicago 
[00:24:30]  in the seventh series spot.  Let's check out the highlights.  I'm not this kid.  Stephen Jackson's David.  He's lost.  Reggie Miller's looking good.  He shoots a three.  And it's good.  Later, he gets the rebound, passes it to the man, shoots it, and boom goes the dynamite. 
[00:25:00]  The final scores end up with the Pacers 63 to the net 61.  We're reminded of that clip today because, obviously, the guy woke up his wife with some dynamite.  But there's boom goes the dynamite.  Just a poor kid trying to get into some broadcasting there as a sports guy.  And he just gets all nervous.  All the highlights are flying by, and he can't keep up with the tape.  And then he wants to get his catchphrase in there, which, of course, is boom goes the dynamite. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  But he doesn't do it on the three-pointer by Reggie Miller.  He was too nervous.  He could hear it through the whole thing.  He's like...  He's making all those nervous noises.  What is it, Brian Collins?  Yeah, it's a very famous video.  Check it out for yourself.  Oh, is that an older one?  Yeah.  That's been around forever, man.  Really?  Oh, my God, yeah.  How old is that?  I'm like a boy filled with wonderment.  He's all nervous.  Mm-hmm.  You have a problem with the Iranian president, the... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, no.  I lost my thought, Jimmy.  I was...  Something was bothering you as we were coming back from break.  Oh, just on the break, we were just talking, and there was something...  The Iranian president spoke somewhere, and just the U.S. delegation walked out.  Walked out in protest.  I mean, it's kind of common, I guess, for countries to do that, but why?  If they do that, it's like to prove a point.  Just shut up.  They all got to get up and make a big scene.  But isn't the whole purpose of, like, getting the U.N. session together there so we could 
[00:26:30]  all kind of talk and try to figure out crap?  Yeah, try to figure it out.  It's not getting up and walking out.  I understand that's a tough thing to do, but to walk out, then why even meet?  Well, the reason was he was standing up there bad-mouthing the United States of America.  He was, you know, saying that it was following Satan.  Well, he didn't mention our name.  He said Western states, and everybody knew who he meant. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said the states.  You know, states.  We know that means us.  So people walked out.  Who cares about anything else.  So we're stuck in traffic all this week for nothing, because nothing is getting accomplished  at the U.N.  But what do you expect him to do?  Say good things about the U.S.?  Right.  Him and he hates us.  Right, right, right.  So it works.  Exactly.  But that's the whole thing of the U.N.  Like Oop said, you know, they get in there and perhaps find some common ground.  This is the idealistic thing that, you know, we find some common ground and maybe get a 
[00:27:30]  start.  And no.  No.  Walk out.  Speaking of him, we got an update.  Remember the gay comment that we played yesterday?  Remember this?  In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country.  We don't have that in our country. 
[00:28:00]  In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon.  And I don't know who's told you that we have it.  Getting huge laughs, right?  That's killing.  Well, check this out.  In the bizarro world of Iranian state-controlled media, God bless freedom of speech.  This is what has been reported in Tehran.  Tehran, Iran.  Their country's leader got a standing ovation at Colombia and fully answered all questions.  Oh, that's how they're reporting it? 
[00:28:30]  Back home.  Back at his home in Iran.  Can you believe that?  Iran, Tehran, they're in the greatest country in the world.  No homosexuals.  Right, right.  A pleasure for me to not be pleasured by man.  Iron chic.  Pleasure for me for the no homo in our country.  Wonderful.  It's great.  I was listening to the replay yesterday when you said the Bush thing. 
[00:29:00]  Bush imitating.  Almost.  That he's proud to say that there's homos in this country.  It's melting pot.  We know.  We understand.  It goes on to say, neither was true.  In its account, Iran's official news agency also removed all mention of the president's  contention that Iran has no gays or lesbians.  They removed that?  Other Iranian media reports focused on university president Lee Bollinger's intro, described as 
[00:29:30]  full of insult, which was mostly Zionists propaganda against Iran.  Ah, the Jews.  The Bollinger thing, the beautiful thing about him, it's amazing how I went from hating this  guy, just, I want to remove that awful hair piece from his head and just brush it for  him and place it gently back with respect.  He said that he, uh, he warned him.  Like, he's like, we didn't sandblast this guy.  There was no surprise.  We told him I was going to be an intro that was very sharply critical.  So they didn't even sandbag him. 
[00:30:00]  They said, this is what we're going to do.  Yeah.  You want to speak here?  And he raised a good point.  He's like, well, the news interviews these guys.  Why can't we have him?  So I was completely wrong.  I think that he should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, I think it was a good thing.  Definitely.  I don't like that smirk he's got on all the time.  This guy is smiling everywhere.  You see him.  The Iranian guy there.  He's a nice smile.  He's just doing his dinero impression.  He's smiling everywhere.  He's just the happiest guy.  The happiest little dictator.  Awful Iranian man hair. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's an Iranian man short, like, like, hard hair.  His hard hair.  You can't tussle that hair.  No.  You hurt your hand.  He's got quills.  He is smiling a lot, though.  He smiles all the time.  And the Iron Sheik is very happy that there's no homosexual.  Iron Sheik, very happy pleasure for me to announce I run a gay, free, no homo in Iran.  Tehran, Iran, greatest country in the world.  Only love women.  No homosexual.  Homosexual men to sit on my end of curly shoes. 
[00:31:00]  Excuse me, Iron Sheik.  Yes.  But you wrestle in very, very, very, very small boy shorts.  Revealing.  Tehran, Iran, greatest country.  You could see my manhood and don't have to worry about another man's head getting close to it.  I could show it off in the safety without a homo come up and try to applaud it for me.  And you're saying not one homosexual in Iran.  Not one homo.  Not a one.  Not one homo in the greatest country in the world. 
[00:31:30]  Iron Sheik from Tehran, Iran.  Greatest country.  When I come to Madison Square Garden, homos everywhere.  Sellout show.  Nothing but homos in America.  Homo.  But in Iran, no glory holes.  No glory hole.  Greatest country.  No glory hole.  Yes, but a burka on the other side with a lovely hairy woman to a pleasure for me.  This is Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, American AAU champion. 
[00:32:00]  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opium bring me here to New York.  To I say hello to all my wrestling friends and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world.  Manhattan Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion. 
[00:32:30]  I want to say hello to all my wrestling friends.  Especially all-American and also my Iranian friend.  Khidmat Hamish and Wendigane.  Iranian Aziz.  Salam arse me-kunam.  Hamid dunia, Aaron Sheik, Khosro Vaziri, Rameshistan.  Pleasure for me to I come back here again one more time to I talk to the Opium and Anthony and pleasure for me always.  What a babbling mess.  By the way, that's the edited version. 
[00:33:00]  Oh yeah, he went on and on.  On and on and on.  And we got that ID right around 9-11.  And in the middle of that he starts babbling in some language and we're like, oh my god, I think he's calling in a strike.  No homosexual.  Terran, Iran.  I original Arabian man from Terran where you won't see men try to put his um in another man's ahoo-hoo. 
[00:33:30]  Pleasure for me to have woman to make the pleasure for me.  Do we have another one?  I gotta hear more of the Iron Sheik today.  This is the Iron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  So far, so good.  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opium and pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans and hello to all people to the wrestling today.  And pleasure to have be here.  Pleasure to have be here. 
[00:34:00]  Alright, so that was pretty good.  Yeah.  Go Sox, go!  Holding off those Yankees.  Gotta love that.  We lost to Tampa Bay again.  That's right, Jimmy.  Because stupid Roger Clemens was supposed to pitch.  What happened?  Oh, he's injured, of course.  Oh.  What's he doing?  Tai Chi.  Goodness gracious!  Oh, goodness gracious!  Roger Clemens on the sidelines because he can't pitch.  He's hurt.  He's on the DL.  He's nursing a hamstring!  So they'll bring in a guy that hasn't had a win since July. 
[00:34:30]  Goodness gracious!  Yeah, goodness gracious.  All they had to do was win.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  This is number 432!  There were 431 other things that were better.  Goodness gracious!  Pleasure for me to be here.  Look at Roger Clemens in the box.  Go Sox, go!  That's what I say.  Yeah.  That's what I say today.  Why do you say that?  Susan Waldman talks like she has a mouth full of spit all the time. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's got a...  Spittly people.  Spittle.  Spittly?  I'm sorry.  A little spittle.  All right.  Another update.  Another story we did yesterday.  The Bill O'Reilly thing.  He's just delusional.  He's just a dope.  He really is just a dope.  And when you see the difference with the way Sharpton addresses what he did and the way he addresses other racial things, it's kind of fun.  We honed it down to the thing O'Reilly said and then the latest on him. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Okay, if that makes sense.  He went up to Harlem to a black restaurant, Sylvia's, with Reverend Al Sharpton.  This is what he had to say about his experience, just to get everyone up to speed.  You know, I was up in Harlem a few weeks ago and I actually had dinner with Al Sharpton, who is a very, very interesting guy.  And he comes on to Factor a lot.  And then I treated him to dinner.  All people up there were tremendously respectful.  They all watched the Factor.  And I couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. 
[00:36:00]  I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship.  It was the same.  And that's really what the society is all about now here in the USA.  There's no difference.  There's no difference.  Okay.  What a dope.  That was actually his reasonable part of the conversation.  Yeah.  He said he was saying things for white people to show white people that racism is like stereotypes are wrong.  But you're like, you're the one who was amazed.  Yeah, he was the one that was amazed. 
[00:36:30]  There was nothing but amazement in his voice.  You're almost 60 and you had an epiphany that black and white restaurants are similar?  If he was explaining to people that were ignorant of the situation, that didn't understand it, that's one thing.  If he was explaining to the people that were amazed.  But he was the guy that was amazed.  Oh my God, they're using utensils.  This is fascinating.  Then he continued.  It's just so awful because, I mean, it's literally the sewer come to the surface and now people take it that the sewer is the whole story. 
[00:37:00]  That's right.  That's right.  There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, MF-er, I want more iced tea.  That disappoints me.  Because I really, I would like to see that.  Yeah, it would make your restaurant experience a little exciting.  MF-er, I want more iced tea.  MF-er.  Like, what an out-of-touch guy talking to whitest black guy ever on the phone.  And Bill, the other people in my race are just embarrassing.  Yes, they are.  Yes.  Stupid. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, what an idiot.  By the way, we love the listeners of this radio show because they're very interactive and they contribute more to this show than any other radio show in America.  And someone is suggesting a new contest for the listeners because they like bragging rights.  They like to, like, create things themselves.  Yeah.  A lot of people have their Macs and need to create.  Yeah.  And they want, someone is suggesting we take the Iron Sheik audio.  Iron Sheik.  Maybe we can put all those IDs up on the website so they can grab that and then make it sound like he's talking about homosexuality or, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:38:00]  Let me get this exactly right.  So, new contest, take the Iron Sheik piece, doctor it up so he is saying he likes homos.  That's a little rough, but he does say pleasure for me.  Pleasure for me.  And, yeah.  But, well, maybe he could add some other clips.  Mm-hmm.  We got some very talented listeners.  We'll see if they run with that.  Good luck to you.  Some of these things they never run with, and that's fine, too.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  So, O'Reilly responded on his show last night about all the controversy.  On the factor.  On the factor.  You know, the spin stops here.  The no spin zone.  Bill O'Reilly is a cornball.  Oh, isn't he?  Yeah, he really is.  The no spin zone.  He seems so phony.  That guy spins more than a freaking tornado in Kansas.  Yeah.  He spins everything.  Watch him spin this.  Yeah.  He's in the no spin zone spinning what he said. 
[00:39:00]  I'm amazed that he's got a huge viewership, and his whole slug line is that there's no spin on his show.  No spin.  When the whole time, all he does is spin.  Spin everything to his opinion and his ideology.  He spins so much.  You know those old YouTube videos where Bono's going around in a circle as he's singing?  Yeah.  That's the camera they should be using on the factor.  That's how much spinning he does.  Did anyone ever see a Bill O'Reilly? 
[00:39:30]  Bill O'Reilly.  It's the finger of God.  His name should be Bill the Oscillator O'Reilly.  He is a spinning zilch.  I'm like 6'8", well-endowed.  God bless him.  I've watched this crap.  I go, how is he getting away with the fact that he's saying that there's no spin here?  No spin zone.  He spins more than anyone else.  CNN goes over to the dark side.  That is the subject of this evening's Five Points Memo. 
[00:40:00]  Every weekday we do three hours of commentary, two on the radio, one on TV.  And every day the far-left smear website Media Matters takes that commentary out of context  and feeds the defamation out to the public.  Media Matters, which acts in concert with the now notorious move-on,  has labeled me anti-black, anti-Hispanic, homophobic, and anti-Semitic.  I'm sure I'll be a member of the Manson family.  Is he annoyed that they left something out?  Is that it?  A member of the Manson family shortly. 
[00:40:30]  Of course, this is all nonsense, and we usually ignore it until it is picked up by the so-called mainstream media.  Elements at NBC News have made a living parroting Media Matters garbage,  and now, sadly, CNN has jumped into the swamp.  Recently on the Radio Factor, I did an hour on how racism is dumb,  how it is driven by fear,  and I even used my own late grandmother as an example.  Wait, hold on.  His late grandmother apparently only enjoyed being double-teamed by blacks. 
[00:41:00]  And he raised that as an example because occasionally whites would try to sneak into the Bill O'Reilly grandmother double-teamed,  and she wouldn't have it.  The darker the berry, the sweeter the jewel.  The old Riley grandmother.  She couldn't get enough.  I even brought her into the mix.  Did you?  Hey, Bill from Waterford, who's celebrating a birthday today.  There's no more spinning on Bill O'Reilly's show than homosexual activity in our Iranian rest area. 
[00:41:30]  Exactly.  Thank you, Bill.  And happy 29th birthday to you, faithful listener of the show.  ...mother as an example.  It's a very interesting discussion,  and we didn't hear one complaint about the program that ran on more than 400 radio stations.  Damn.  Yeah, welcome to the club is right.  Man, bravo on that.  I don't know what you mean.  He's basically saying he said this crap on his radio show, 400 stations, not a complaint.  And that's usually what happens with radio shows. 
[00:42:00]  Exactly.  It's not the people listening to the radio show that starts the complaining.  It's someone that doesn't listen to the show.  Never heard it.  See, this guy, what an idiot.  And he's the first one to condemn, like, what we do.  Oh, stop.  I want to hear more about the old slut.  Yeah.  No kidding, man.  Bring on that old bag.  The old shish kebab grandma.  Bring black and don't walk through my front door.  That's what grandma O'Reilly used to be fond of saying. 
[00:42:30]  I did all the Tuskegee airmen.  They treated me like a hanger.  One in one hand, one in the other.  Oh, five fellas at one time I can take care of.  Seven if you count me ears.  She'd like to play World War II fighter pilot.  The O'Reilly grandmother.  Oh, she could service a group.  Bird of Philly writes, all the way May and Granny O'Reilly worked near the apple orchards together. 
[00:43:00]  She loved them sweaty when they'd come in from working all day.  They may not treat you equal, but I will.  Oh, look at my grandson peeking in through the door.  He's six, eight, and he's only three.  How did he bring her up?  I wonder what he said about his old granny.  Oh, boy.  K-Rock dumped your joke.  Which joke did they dump?  What, everything? 
[00:43:30]  Who knows?  Why would they dump it?  Because they're just a bunch of dopes.  And just a real quick, Sharpton.  Yeah.  Sharpton said he and O'Reilly have eaten together in Harlem before and was surprised at the radio comments.  I understand he says he's been taken out of context.  I'll be going on his show, and I want to talk directly to him.  Man, that's what Sharpton says about that.  Yeah.  All right.  These two are what they call a-hole buddies.  Believe me.  I thought you were going to go in cahoots. 
[00:44:00]  They love the publicity.  They're both from the same mold, man.  They love the fact that they are famous.  They like the money that goes along with it.  All that stuff.  And they're hooked up.  They're supposedly polar opposites in their views.  But they go out, eat, probably laugh.  Look at what we're doing.  This is great.  You come on my show, and we'll get into it a little bit.  After the break, we got more O'Reilly trying to defend himself.  And Scott M. from Hoppog writes, 
[00:44:30]  This guy is such a phony that I might throw up if I have to listen to his crap anymore.  Bring on Britney Got Fat.  You will hear Britney Got Fat.  Oh, yeah.  As part of the morning show bit of the day Wednesday.  I have to know what they dumped.  Oh, the double team thing.  That's, yeah, that's good.  Really?  Why would you dump that, dude?  Hmm.  That's good.  Which one?  That's not...  Yeah, you tell them, Jimmy. 
[00:45:00]  Dude, it's just...  It is.  What's the matter with you?  What?  Why would you dump that?  Well, now let's go in there and show them what it means.  That's what I say.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, The Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:45:30]  Nicky Six coming in today, by the way.  Very cool.  He's a really good guest.  We've had him on over the years.  A real rock star.  This is from Motley Crue.  You know what?  We should talk to him about that.  He is a real rock star.  He's not a poser.  No, he's an animal.  There's been so many posers in the last 10 years.  Make him believe they're rock stars.  He is the real deal.  Also, Howie Mandel calling in again today.  They got a big thing happening with Deal and No Deal tonight he wants to talk about.  I'm obsessed with that stupid toilet he talked about.  I have to get it. 
[00:46:00]  Right?  Yeah.  The way the bidet works on that toilet, by the way, it's like, you're like, well, how  does he have two in one?  Because you wouldn't be able to use it after you use the bathroom.  But the bidet thing comes out.  So after you flush, apparently the bidet thing comes out and it acts as a bidet.  So you're not getting it all soiled.  Yeah.  And then it goes back into its little bidet holder place.  Like a little straw or whatever that shoots water.  I have to get that toilet down.  The toilet's like a great toilet.  What?  Two, three thousand dollars or something like that?  I haven't priced it.  But I want it for the living room.  You don't annoy my girlfriend.  You don't make eye contact with her the whole time. 
[00:46:30]  You don't touch anything.  Right.  It knows you're coming.  So the lid comes up and no flushing, nothing.  It just knows what to do for whatever reason.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Of course, that's one of the staples of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're looking for the women out there to do a little flashing if they see those WOW stickers  on the highways.  Those are fans of the show.  They got the WOW bumper stickers.  Most of the radio stations that we're on, they're very motivated about the radio show  and they got WOW stickers out there.  If the station you're listening on is not motivated, then you take it upon yourself to make a homemade 
[00:47:00]  WOW sign that shows support for the radio show and also it might get you a little boobage  in the morning as you're driving to work.  There are plenty of women out there that will flash you.  At ONA events, it happens all day long.  Right?  Love it.  And of course, we got the PAL talk happening and the girls in PAL talk, they're wowing like  crazy every Wednesday.  So you might want to look into getting PAL talk.  I don't know.  If you want to see topless women in the morning. 
[00:47:30]  Also, our new bit, Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday, is a huge hit.  What a big hit that is.  Did you expect everyone waiting for us this morning to do it?  No, I really didn't.  We throw a lot of these.  And there they were.  We do throw a lot of these themes out there.  It's just.  They're stupid.  They're stupid.  I'll be honest with you.  They're stupid.  But I guess if you throw enough out there, one or two might actually work.  Yeah.  And this one is a dandy.  And a lot of the listeners like the stupid ones, too.  Because it's just that stupid. 
[00:48:00]  It just creates stupid talk.  Tim, with the official promo for Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  Oh, my God. 
[00:48:30]  Don't be an ant.  All right.  I'm going to break and kill you.  There you go.  You know what?  That's all from today.  That's great.  We had a very busy morning when we got here at 6 a.m.  Tim's got to redo this, though.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse.  Yeah.  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday, not Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  Well, Tim's defense will be that there are plenty of roommates.  Roommates that are doing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Wake Up Your...  Wake Up Your...  Ah, whatever.  Wake Up...  Ah, just leave it.  Yeah, wake up something.  Why does it need a real full name? 
[00:49:00]  And here's the replay from this morning.  This was the big...  The faithful listeners hate when I say this, but I'm going to say it today.  This is the big get today.  Oh.  Someone waking up their spouse with dynamite.  This is how it went down about an hour ago.  Jerry, you got a stick of dynamite?  Quarterstick.  Oh, quarterstick.  Okay.  And you want to wake her up with that.  How are you going to do it?  Where are you going to put it?  Inside a pot, so she doesn't get hurt, but it'll be loud.  And how close are you going to put it to her? 
[00:49:30]  Right next to her on the bed.  No, I wouldn't put it...  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Not next to her.  I wouldn't put it right next to her.  Put it on the floor.  All right.  But away from her.  Like, across the room.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, get the phone close to her, all right?  The key to Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday, we need to hear the waking up part.  All right.  Jerry, the show is yours.  Go ahead.  What is it? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, my God!  That is going to be really hard to top.  Yeah.  She saw it light, and she thought it was something romantic.  She thought it was a candle.  What is that?  Wow.  That is awesome.  Now, for next week, we're looking for...  How about next week we look more for creativity?  Yeah.  A little creativity next week, because this is getting a little dangerous now. 
[00:50:30]  We're only two weeks in, and we're using dynamite to wake up people.  Dynamite!  Don't we learn from the past with this radio show?  Some suggestions?  Perhaps a super soaker to the face.  Oh, beautiful.  That would be really good.  Beautiful.  Let's get creative next week.  Mm-hmm.  Let's try for creativity next week.  Yeah.  Stay away from the dynamite for a week or two, okay?  Something scary.  How about a real scary...  Halloween's coming up.  How about a real scary mask? 
[00:51:00]  Put some newspaper in it to fill it out, and lay it down so it's looking right at the  person's face, like one inch away.  Yeah.  And then just go like, wake up.  Wake up.  And when they open their eyes, just a horrified scream is what you'll get.  I think that's a good idea, too.  Because that would just...  I hate opening my eyes to somebody, like, right there.  Like, if I'm sleeping in on a rare occasion, I get to sleep in, and my girlfriend's got 
[00:51:30]  to leave.  She'll, like, want to kiss me goodbye.  So she comes up and wakes me up, and she knows she can't, like, be right near my face,  or I just lose my mind.  I think it's somebody coming to kill me.  Don't make me re-tell the Buffalo story for the 20th time.  20th time.  No.  Why'd you even have to say that?  Bringing back that freaking nightmare again.  It's just scary when someone's really close to your face, and you wake up.  If you don't have a Halloween mask, you could also use a ski mask, because that implies 
[00:52:00]  robbery.  Ah, let's stay away from the ski masks.  Wake up.  Yeah, and you see a ski mask?  That's great.  All right, back to Bill O'Reilly.  O'Reilly.  He was trying to defend himself yesterday.  I hope you were lingering longer, because we can't replay all the clips we just did.  But he's, the big setup, real fast, 10 seconds, 15 seconds.  Bill O'Reilly went up to Harlem and was amazed and surprised that the blacks acted like whites  in restaurants, and now he's catching some heat for it, so he went on his show with a 
[00:52:30]  no-spin zone on Fox, and tried to explain himself by spinning.  Right, spinning what he was saying.  Pretty much what he did.  He spun.  What an idiot.  Well, yesterday, Media Matters distorted the entire conversation, and implied I was racist  for condemning racism.  Stunningly, CNN echoed the defamation on at least three of its programs.  The reason CNN did this is because its ratings are abysmal. 
[00:53:00]  It is getting hammered by Fox News, so they're desperate for attention.  And smearing me is one way to get it.  Unfortunately, many in CNN's audience have no idea what I said, and some believe the garbage  they are hearing.  Now, I talked to CNN last night before that program.  It was obvious they didn't listen to the radio factor, so I explained the deal.  They went ahead with the racist angle anyway.  This is dishonest and dangerous.  If a sly machine like Media Matters can get its far-left propaganda on CNN and NBC News, 
[00:53:30]  the nation is in trouble.  He didn't address it.  He didn't address it.  He's going to attempt to address it with his next clip, and then he kind of reiterates  everyone's problem with what he had to say.  Well, I'd love to know if Fox went after Wolf Blitzer for saying, so poor, so black.  They're all going after each other because they're competing.  It's like, no honesty.  No.  It's like they're competing for ratings.  Yeah, that's why it's not news.  It's TV shows. 
[00:54:00]  It's entertainment.  Thank you.  They're a bunch of phonies.  I was reading a really good blog by Lee Abrams.  A blog.  That works for XM, and he talks about how these news organizations like CNN and Fox and stuff,  they're entertainment programs, and they blur it.  You think you're actually watching news.  You're not watching news anymore.  Nope.  You're not.  And then he mentions us.  It's like when you listen to the Opie and Anthony show, you know what you're going to get.  Yeah.  A lot of sarcasm and a lot of, you know, we are what we are. 
[00:54:30]  We're not trying to be anything else but Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, we're just douches that just point out a lot of this crap and make fun of a lot  of people, right?  Yep.  But the news, under the guise that are doing a news program, they're not doing a news program.  It's entertainment.  No, they use the backdrop of news to then comment and titillate.  And it's a blur.  They're blurring it.  You think you're watching news, but you're really, really not.  Really not.  And Lee Abrams, by the way, people who don't know, he works for XM, and he's at the forefront 
[00:55:00]  of the medicinal marijuana for pilots organization.  He believes it's smoking pot when you fly.  He's good for everyone.  And he flies upside down, and he has a big, creepy mustache.  Very homoerotic mustache.  We're satirists.  When you listen to us, we're satirists.  Satirists.  Right?  I believe so.  From us?  Satire.  Satirer.  We're not trying to be anything but what we are.  All right.  Here's Bill O'Reilly.  Just kind of, I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  Spinning.  Spinning.  And to set up your appearance, I told people about my grandmother and how she feared blacks,  even though she didn't know any blacks.  Now, Jimmy.  She feared blacks, even though she didn't know any blacks.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, wow.  So that was the story of his granny.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think that was a cover.  I think what happened was he came home.  A young Bill came home one day and said, Nana.  And her like, uh, uh. 
[00:56:00]  Nana.  And looked in the bedroom door, and there was Nana.  And there was two gentlemen standing, and it looked like Nana's in a hammock.  So she was swinging back and forth.  And she had to say, oh, help.  Call the police, young Bill.  Because she didn't want young Bill to understand.  Yes.  And then she went on to talk about how she was afraid.  And how you can't tell Grandpa.  Right.  What you saw.  And then I proceeded to tell the audience how ridiculous the fear was 
[00:56:30]  by recounting a story about me going to Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem with Al Sharpton.  Now, you heard the comments.  You saw everything.  What do you think about this dishonesty at CNN?  It's rank dishonesty.  And the troubling thing is that if I hadn't participated in the discussion,  if I was just tuning in to CNN or listening to MSNBC  and heard that, oh, Bill O'Reilly said he went to Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem 
[00:57:00]  and they weren't using MF and all this kind of stuff,  I said, oh, my God, what is he thinking?  Where is that coming from?  Why did he say something like that?  Not understanding that that discussion, Bill O'Reilly, you know,  I'm telling you, it's so frustrating.  They want to shut you up.  They want to shut up anybody who has an honest discussion about race.  You mentioned your grandmother.  You mentioned the idea that, you know, what your grandmother...  Oh, Rochester.  What did they get this guy from, UncleTom.com?  We get it. 
[00:57:30]  White people like you.  You don't understand.  I mean, you know, what are you going to say about Nat King Cole?  What are you going to say about people like Willie Mays?  What are you going to say about people that you admire?  And now they take this discussion and somehow turn it on its head.  I'm really appalled.  Are you?  Are you?  Yeah.  And the problem was O'Reilly came off and said,  I used my grandmother's, like how wrong grandma was to be afraid.  Right.  And yet you, Bill, said, and I was amazed that it was just like you, at your age,  just admitted you were amazed that Sylvia's was the same as any other restaurant. 
[00:58:00]  He was amazed.  So you've learned nothing from Nana.  You've learned nothing from Nana.  Nana.  Nana.  Nana, what are you doing in there with those men?  Yeah.  Oh, don't worry.  Are you playing the harmonica?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  This just gives Bill O'Reilly ratings.  That's what it comes down to.  He loves it.  No real problem here whatsoever.  He loves it.  Of course he loves it.  Notice he doesn't mention MSNBC.  He's got a huge battle going with Keith Oberman, another guy. 
[00:58:30]  He says some interesting things on his show, but he's a dishonest ass.  He's a phony.  He's a phony.  But Bill O'Reilly and Keith Oberman are just fighting for every ratings point they can.  Notice Bill doesn't mention that.  He mentioned CNN.  But MSNBC was all over it.  I think Keith Oberman started this whole problem for Bill O'Reilly.  Did he?  So why not go after Keith Oberman, you dishonest F?  He loves it.  When he's in the news like that?  Of course he does. 
[00:59:00]  It's his job.  Get into the news.  He doesn't report the news or anything.  He wants to get into the news.  It's a show.  It's not news.  Bill O'Reilly is on Fox News.  But it's not news.  No.  It's a TV show.  It's sort of news.  It's an entertainment show that uses the news as like a backdrop.  Uses current events as a backdrop for him to throw in his opinions and everything.  He calls it the no spin zone because he thinks people are going to believe that he's just reporting the news. 
[00:59:30]  No.  He's talking about the news and putting his own spin on it.  His opinion of it and anyone else's opinion isn't valid.  It's garbage.  It's not the real opinion to have.  I'm so glad we're finally talking about this because I've been amazed for so many years.  I'm like, Bill O'Reilly is calling a show the no spin zone?  It's got to be the worst name for a TV news program ever.  He's got the last word. 
[01:00:00]  And he says it's his show.  So whatever he says goes.  He's spinning it his way.  And the only problem with that is the news gets such a special set of rules for them.  If you're going to be a show like that, it's cool, but you should not be allowed the leeway that typically news is allowed.  Right, right.  Because you have a tremendous advantage over other entertainment programs when you're kind of just doing.  It's not right for them to have that kind of news umbrella they can hide under.  It is amazing how many people buy into it, though, that it's news. 
[01:00:30]  They put it on and go, do you hear that on the news?  And then, you know, people that have been involved directly with the news because you've been reported on in the past.  Hello?  You've got to tell them, like, no, no, no.  It doesn't work that way.  That isn't real.  I like shows, especially like news shows and stuff, that aren't blurring what they are.  Yeah.  I like the word blur.  Like, Lee Abrams used it in his blog, and I really like that.  It's what he sees out of the windshield of his plane. 
[01:01:00]  He's a drug addict.  It's just a blur.  But he makes a good point.  It's like Fox News is blurring what they are.  They're making believe they're a news program.  They're not really a news program.  Okay?  I'm loving the show TMZ.  Loving it.  And I'll tell you what, we're trying to get the guy on the show, but he's blown up to this.  He's a huge star now, the guy that runs TMZ.  Yeah.  But TMZ is not blurring what they are.  It's a show where it's all about Hollywood gossip, but they're not making it all cutesy 
[01:01:30]  and stuff.  They're like, look, look, Hollywood, they're just a bunch of asses, and we're going to show  them driving drunk.  We're going to show them coming out of clubs drunk.  We're going to goof on it.  We're going to show them doing stupid stuff, and we're not going to go, oh, this was unfortunate.  We're going to be like, look, look, they're idiots.  Look at this jerk.  They're just a bunch of dopes.  And a show that's very similar to TMZ is like The Insider and Entertainment Tonight, but  they kind of blur what they are.  They know people want to see celebrities in weird situations, but they don't have the balls 
[01:02:00]  to say, look at these idiots being idiots.  They'll show them as idiots and then go, tragic, how that career has turned out.  And then some of the co-hosts will be, yeah, yeah, tragic.  And now let's talk about happy birthday.  Like they're trying to be with those people.  They're trying to be, you know what I mean?  They want to be part of that situation, so they don't want to go too far with it.  But TMZ, they're like, oh, we got paparazzi video all over the place, and it's all these 
[01:02:30]  people you watch on TV and in the movies being just idiots.  Yep.  And we're just going to acknowledge it up front.  We are showing you people, big stars being idiots.  And that's why I like TMZ.  Yeah.  They're not blurring what they are.  That's it.  They don't give a crap if they're not invited to the next Hollywood party because of what  they're doing with their show.  Like Bill O'Reilly.  I respect that.  I think that's cool as hell.  No spin.  Well, speaking of wake up your spouse, internet video of the day is the guy waking up, being 
[01:03:00]  woken up by firecrackers, which is very similar to what we did today.  The video is terrific.  We got the audio for everybody before we take a break.  Here it is.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  That sounds just like ours.  That is ours, unfortunately. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Something got mixed up.  What happened?  That's all right.  No worries.  I can't get enough of that anyway.  Yeah.  We love that so much.  I love that.  There's like three or four different versions of that.  Yeah.  That's from our show.  Well, we just played it.  Yeah.  Oh, there we are.  All right.  Is this going to be as good?  This is the guy being woken up by firecrackers.  Watch it be the same thing again.  Like every single thing.  Even the music.  We were so excited that the guy woke up his wife with the dynamite.  I'm not kidding.  We have three or four different versions now of that all over the place.  It's in a promo.  There's a long form.  There's a short form. 
[01:04:00]  That's what we do with this stuff.  The guy pretty much just gets up and runs away.  Yeah.  He's like on a dead sleep on the couch and then just gets up and runs.  I got to tell you.  Ours is better.  Ours is better.  All right.  When we get back, it's also morning zoo bit of the day.  We got a dozy.  Morning zoo bits.  We got Britney got fat. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know, guys.  And it's the set up to it.  The song itself.  Yeah.  Is just cringeworthy.  Oh, Sam was so excited to hand this in today.  I defy you to listen to this and not just go, oh, does one of these shows do it?  Oh, yeah.  And we'll talk about the show that's doing it.  We'll talk about their publicity photo.  We'll highlight them.  Hey, before we go to break, I got to let you know about cash for gold dot com. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, the white stripes.  Nice.  Opie and Anthony.  Did the Meg White thing go away?  Yeah, I don't think it's her.  The sex tape and then they have still pictures from the sex tape.  I don't think it's her, though.  Looks like a younger version of her.  Could be.  Know what didn't go away?  We'll get into in a few minutes here.  The Oscar de la Hoya.  That's just getting worse. 
[01:05:30]  New pictures?  Oh, no.  The new thing around my apartment.  My girl there.  I hate how I say Oscar de la Hoya.  De la Hoya.  Because I have to really exaggerate the last part of his name.  And now that I know it bothers her, I just walk around the apartment.  Oscar de la Hoya.  Oscar de la Hoya.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  My ex actually called me last night.  Yeah?  12.30 right as I was going to bed.  And I forgot to ask her to call today.  My media call tomorrow if I'm going to bed.  No, we need her on the show because, you know what? 
[01:06:00]  Hey, we'll be honest.  We are an honest show.  We want to be on TMZ.  And we got a friend of the show.  An exclusive.  A special friend of Jimmy's.  An ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  That swears that she used to do some things with Oscar de la Hoya.  Oscar de la Hoya.  Yeah.  Well, she told me that when we first dated back in like 2000.  I dated her.  She was at my apartment on 9-11.  Like, that's like when our relationship was. 
[01:06:30]  So it was like.  But before that, she told me about de la Hoya.  So in 2000 or 2001.  Yeah.  I kind of remember you bringing it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the Russian stripper.  Oh, she's just a class act.  She's now releasing more pictures of Oscar de la Hoya.  De la Hoya.  I believe he's in a white bikini.  A white bikini.  Oscar, no.  How great is that?  Not after Labor Day.  Oscar, you should have known better. 
[01:07:00]  Sissy.  Should we, well, why don't we do the.  But we promised Britney got fat.  Yeah, we did.  De la Hoya in a bikini.  All right.  Let's do some Oscar de la Hoya.  We didn't go to lockdown.  Huh?  We didn't go to lockdown so we could go anywhere.  And I talked about.  Fast phrase, Jamaica station.  Opie, your girlfriend is now your fiance.  I know.  I just don't like saying fiance.  I'm not trying to, you know, ignore that fact.  It's just easier to say.  Fiance is a silly word.  I hate the word fiance. 
[01:07:30]  Fiance.  I like what it means.  First of all.  In my life.  But I like saying my, my chick, my girlfriend, my, my, my, my, you know.  She said to stop being your girlfriend if you're engaged.  Right.  That would be silly.  All right.  My fiance.  Where's my fiance?  I love that.  And now the Russian stripper said that someone else got her camera, right?  Yeah.  After she took these pictures of Oscars.  She's not fessed up to the fact that she probably had the pictures. 
[01:08:00]  And, you know, sold them.  Whatever.  And why wouldn't she defend him if that's the truth and say, yeah, those are fake.  I hate this pig.  Yeah.  You don't like her.  I know.  I hate her.  This is a little too close to home to you.  I think.  I think this is a little too close to home for Jimmy.  So, you're looking at this girl like she is just the devil.  But it's like, why would, I just, it annoys me because, like, why would you do it to the  guy?  It's like, for what?  Yeah.  We still don't know why she would do it.  For money.  Like, did Oscar De La Hoya do her wrong or what? 
[01:08:30]  For money.  Or does she need attention and she's got a little something that's going to make her  a star and popular for the next week or so.  I don't like Russian strippers.  And cash.  And that's the beauty of a lot of these.  My feelings on those strippers.  A lot of these instant celebrities, they really think that, you know, this is going to be the  thing that really makes them famous for a long time.  No.  For a week.  Two weeks.  Like, leave Britney alone.  Who?  Exactly.  This is a voicemail from the Russian stripper. 
[01:09:00]  She claimed that someone got her camera and that's why the pictures got out.  But this is a voicemail where she's basically saying something very different.  Oh.  Very different.  I can't believe it.  This is so stupid.  Because I could have got so much more money out of this.  What am I going to, what is going to happen to me?  The whole, the whole America is watching this.  They're making so much money on me.  And you let them take advantage of me and do this for $70,000. 
[01:09:30]  What am I going to do next?  $70,000 or $7,000?  $70,000.  She goes, what am I going to do next?  I have a suggestion.  It involves a rope and a stool.  And you're probably fake breasts.  Disgusting.  Well.  Wow.  And why do they have to put music behind the...  Because it's one of these entertainment shows.  You can't hear the sound.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  Well, what did we hear in there?  She just feels guilty.  Oh, no.  The next clip.  She was saying, I can't believe you did this. 
[01:10:00]  I could have made a lot more money on this.  I don't know who she's talking about.  So what?  She's got some kind of agent where she said, hey, I got these pictures.  Get as much money as you can.  And then she realized after the fact that she could have got more money.  Perhaps.  That she used the wrong guy.  That's what I'm thinking.  All right.  Jimmy, are you...  Yeah, I think I'm going to...  What?  My phone just rang.  And it was a California number.  So I think it was...  Ah.  Is she listening right now?  Uh-huh.  I just texted her.  All right.  We'll get her to call the show.  TMZ, here we come. 
[01:10:30]  That's what we want to hear.  It's going to be...  You'll have to phrase it a certain way.  I understand.  Okay.  TMZ, here we come.  She feels guilty about crushing De La...  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  Ah.  I mean, you've crushed a million hearts of kids that are in love with this good guy.  He's an idol of America.  People look up to him.  I just bashed in his image.  Nobody...  Everybody hates him now for doing this. 
[01:11:00]  This was not worth the price that we're being for.  I'm really upset about just saying, I can't eat, I can't eat, I'm throwing up.  And...  And I can't believe that we...  Thank you, guys.  I wish we would have been like this one.  Wow.  She feels really guilty about what she did, but she...  Does she?  Because I couldn't tell with that goddamn music playing.  Why on earth?  That annoys me more than the story itself. 
[01:11:30]  What the hell stupid show did that come from?  I think, uh...  I think it's Entertainment Tonight on that one.  You know how hard it is to hear a message in the first place?  Right.  You really gotta kinda concentrate and listen when they play these tape message things on  a news show.  And they're burying it in this music, this dramatic music, to make it more, what, compelling?  Is that to make it their own so you can't play it without...  Maybe.  I don't know.  It's just a...  It's the dumbest friggin' thing. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, just...  Stop with the...  So basically, she's feeling guilty that she destroyed Oscar De La Hoya's life.  Yeah.  But she's more...  She feels...  She really feels like she should've got a lot more money.  More money.  And by the way, she's the one to blame.  Yeah.  She's the only one that knew she had these pictures.  She had the pictures.  She started talking to other people, and they're like, hey, you can sell these, so she decided  to sell them, and then she's mad because she didn't get a nice big payday for the picture. 
[01:12:30]  You hit delete, the pictures go away.  Right.  And your problem's solved.  Her problem is that she destroyed Oscar De La Hoya's reputation for only $7,000, when she  could've destroyed his reputation for about $70,000.  No, she got $70,000, I think.  Did she get $70,000?  Oh, but she wanted more.  She thinks she could've got more, yeah.  All right, so that's what she's, you know, really pissed about.  Because it turned into a bigger story than I think she thought of.  Well, she doesn't care that she wrecked his reputation.  She cares that she wrecked his reputation for such a little amount of money.  I could've made more money. 
[01:13:00]  Stop, Russian strippers.  Look to our American strippers.  We outsourced our strippers.  Well, we got a guy from Gotham Magazine.  Says the woman sold the pics to X-17.  Gotham Magazine columnist R. Corey Hay broke the photo story and has been in contact with  Milana.  The truth is, she signed a contract with X-17 online for 70% of all profits, 30% to the  photo agency, 70% to her.  I've seen the contract.  She signed it in front of me.  I saw her do this. 
[01:13:30]  Hmm.  See?  She was looking for a nice payday and full fame.  A little payday and then it got real.  Oh, we finally got Oscar De La Hoya commenting about this whole thing.  Oh, good.  Yes, I got the exclusive clip that you'll only hear on the Opie and Anthony show.  Good.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, all right.  That explains it.  Explains a lot there.  At least.  Where's Jimmy?  He's trying to...  What is he doing?  On the phone.  He's on the phone.  Yeah, he's on the phone.  He's doing a pre-interview, I think, with... 
[01:14:00]  Oh, really?  With this young lady that, well, I guess, from what I heard from Jimmy, she supposedly  dated Oscar De La Hoya.  Ah, you didn't say his name right.  Oscar De La...  Yeah.  And supposedly dated him and has some stories.  Yeah.  Now, this isn't a bit.  We're not going to come up with some wacky bit.  Oh, no. 
[01:14:30]  Jimmy's left the show.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the real deal.  Yeah.  Hello, TMZ.  Here we come.  But, you know, I don't know how this is presented on how you do this.  Like, you can't just have somebody's opinion on something, but she's willing to go, you  know, the distance.  It's like the real news.  You got your source, and then they say something, and you're banking on their credibility, because  if anything happens, you could use them to bail you out, because it really happened, and they're 
[01:15:00]  willing to go to the... and actually testify, if it gets that far, that it did happen.  Right.  And usually, if it did, the guy that you're talking about doesn't want to get that into  a courtroom and in public, so they don't make a big fuss about it.  But from what I hear, it's pretty seedy stuff.  Oh, man, is it good.  Wow.  Pretty seedy stuff.  Jimmy, coming back into the room, he's smiling. 
[01:15:30]  What's up, Jimmy?  No, she's actually, we were talking, I think she actually feels bad.  She's like, but isn't that going to hurt him or ruin him?  She's like, isn't that bad?  I think he's...  Well, I said to her, I said, look, I mean, simply, you're not, you're just a person calling  on a phone.  You're not releasing anything that's real or tangible.  Right.  You're just, you're somebody saying something that you're just kind of adding to a story  that's already out there.  Yeah.  Did she ever take pictures when she was dating? 
[01:16:00]  No.  I don't think she would release them anyway.  No.  No, I know.  Nah, it's not her vibe.  She's a perv, but she's not...  So is she going to call in?  I told her I'll text her the number.  It's just a matter of, she just laughed at what she used to do.  I'll text the number.  Are you very happy with the fact that she won't release pictures and she's not that type  of person, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  Good girl, good girl.  I'd like to see that.  You, boxing gloves.  Well, do we have time before break or should we wait until we come out? 
[01:16:30]  I can tell her when to call.  Probably after break.  Yeah, yeah.  If we don't get Britney...  We know that, dude.  Hey, Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith's Boring Ass Life book.  He's plugging it on Fox News.  Fox.  Local Fox.  Yeah.  Here we go.  There's a new De La Hoya picture.  De La Hoya.  Listen to this one, Jimmy.  As this firestorm is about to erupt again, E.T. has obtained this new image.  Once again, it appears to be De La Hoya striking a girlish pose in that white tutu. 
[01:17:00]  And Milana says she has more.  Do you still have those photos?  Yes, I do.  Oh, wow.  A white tutu?  What is he into?  I saw a white bikini top or something.  They're calling it a tutu.  I saw the bikini top.  I'm wondering if she's got some really bad ones that she wants.  I wonder if she...  I'm going to speculate.  This is a guess.  Did she try to blackmail him?  And he goes, ah, what is she going to try with the really bad ones? 
[01:17:30]  Like, you know...  Oh, you know which ones I have.  You know...  This is what's out there.  You're still salvageable.  Yeah, because why is she...  She continues to just release pictures.  A little bit here, a little bit there.  And Oscar De La Hoya's lawyers, like, look, they just went...  Oscar De La Hoya's lawyer.  Yeah, they just went with the, these are fake.  Yeah.  So, it seems to me that Oscar talked to his lawyers, like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, please just put that in people's heads.  Please, please.  Just please put that in everyone's heads, because some other ones could come out. 
[01:18:00]  Well, dude, De La Hoya's lawyers...  I don't think that De La Hoya's lawyers have any real argument, because they're real photos.  Yeah.  Apparently.  Well, the lawyer hasn't talked in a day or two.  Poor Oscar.  Because I think the lawyer's like, oh, Oscar.  He's just hoping it goes away.  Oscar, what are you doing?  Oh, Oscar.  I really feel...  You might want to find another lawyer that's willing to play your game, because I'm out.  Who knows?  He's into some weird stuff.  Could be any one of us, guys.  Could it?  A tutu?  Oh, no.  Do we have the tutu picture?  I want to see the tutu picture.  I saw it last night on TV. 
[01:18:30]  I haven't found it on the web this morning.  How do we not have the tutu photo?  No, I don't know.  The white bikini one or the tutu?  Both of them.  I saw the white bikini.  Either one.  One's as sexy as the other.  I saw the white bikini or something like that.  All right, listen.  It's also a morning show bit of...  Morning zoo bit of the day Wednesday.  Excuse me.  And we highlight morning shows and their wacky bits that they do.  Right.  On their morning zoos.  And, well, today's wacky bit...  And let's make it perfectly clear, because this is a newer thing we're doing on the Opie 
[01:19:00]  and Anthony show.  We think these...  Here it is.  That's why.  Oh, no.  Oh, Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  How do you Photoshop you?  That is...  Oh, my...  He's giving her a real hug and a white tutu, but the face on her is just awful.  She's like, ugh.  I smell like Cuervo.  She couldn't...  He better.  She's like, look.  I hate to think he's sober. 
[01:19:30]  Jesus.  No kidding.  It's a white tutu with a tiny little white bikini top, it looks like, right?  Yeah.  With a white fishnet stocking.  What kind of shoes is he wearing?  Is he wearing the right shoes?  I feel like we're such a catty show now.  Yeah.  They better match.  It looks awful in that.  Those shoes.  I hope they're the boxer shoes that they wear.  Like, the lace-up...  All laced up, yeah.  La Mata.  I think this is the point where she's disturbed.  She's got a cigarette in her hand.  Like, all right, look.  I need a cigarette.  I need to, like, kind of digest what's going on here in this hotel room. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, at this point, she's thinking how she's going to cash in on these pictures,  because now she's...  It went from fun to she's just disgusted.  When she heard, like, she was going to get to hook up with Oscar de la Hoya,  she's probably like, oh, my God, this guy's a real man.  And he's an alpha male.  It's going to be great.  Just going to...  Well, X17 Online gets the big plug today.  There you go.  He's Tweedledee Dumming around the room, Tiss-Tissing everybody.  Don't ash on that.  Yuck.  Yeah, she thought she was going to, like, get something from a real man.  And he's in a tutu. 
[01:20:30]  Maybe she was cool with, like, him wearing maybe, I don't know, a pair of panties or  stuff.  Yeah, why wouldn't you be there?  And then all of a sudden, it just escalated to this.  She just lost control.  Oh, you like the panties?  Wait till you see what I got in the closet here.  It comes out in the fishnet thing.  Yeah, and now she's, like...  With his bat wing hanging out.  This picture, like, looks like she's tapping out.  Like, okay, look.  You had it.  Look, stop, Oscar.  You got issues, man.  Oscar.  All right, morning's a bit of the day.  Comes from Vegas.  Yeah, we want to make it perfectly... 
[01:21:00]  What is this one?  Perfectly clear.  What?  Another one?  What does he wear?  Oh, my God.  He's in little pink shorts.  That's a pink, like, short skirt.  Whoa.  Like a short, short skirt.  Oh, Oscar.  With tiny pink panties underneath that basically are not covering up the area.  No one photoshopped this.  No one is that good.  No.  If you do, could you photoshop me in my head shots?  I'd love to be handsome.  No one's so determined.  And then he's got a t-shirt on that has, like, boobies on the t-shirt. 
[01:21:30]  Where?  Oh, no.  Go up.  Oh, Jesus.  God.  He kind of...  He really likes this stuff.  He does.  I mean...  Well, we got some of that.  We'll call the show, hopefully.  I'm texting.  Hopefully after the break.  Because from what I've heard, it goes a little further than just dress.  Well...  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  She feels guilty. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Can we get this bit in or what?  Morning Zoo bit of the day.  It comes from a morning show out of Vegas.  Yeah.  What is that?  He's doing a little kick.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He's doing the can-can.  He's doing the can-can.  He's wearing his tutu and his white little bikini top.  And you can see his six-pack abs.  He's doing the can-can in a white tutu.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:22:30]  Come on.  He's going to kill himself.  Do you know that?  Yeah.  This is something that maybe as a guy, a boxer, all the men you hang out with, it might  be a little too much for him.  I told Steve to try to get him.  We had a great interview with him that day he was in.  Remember when he came in?  He was a fun interview and he's one of the greatest champions ever.  Oh, that's right.  You know, I completely forgot he was in here.  Wait, what happened?  He had Oscar in.  And he was a great interview.  He was fun.  I completely forgot he was in here.  I forgot that we had Oscar on.  Oh, I didn't.  Wonderful.  Oh, we should have asked him about this.  Well, I knew back then.  I want to hear the interview at some point and see if we said anything, because we usually 
[01:23:00]  say stupid stuff.  He might have gone like, oh, geez, in his head like, oh, no.  Like cross-dressing.  Or if there's any type of...  No, I would have avoided that stuff on purpose because I kind of knew what I knew.  Oh, right.  I would have even joked about it.  Yeah.  Just like...  Wow.  He was plugging some Dominican Day or Puerto Rican Day event.  I don't remember why.  Yeah.  How racist of me.  He dressed like one of those women from Carnival.  All right.  Big headdress.  We'll try to get Jimmy's ex on the phone to talk a little bit about this. 
[01:23:30]  I like the fact she feels bad, though.  That makes me happy as I tease my batwing.  Hey, are we going to play the Britney song or what?  We got Nikki Sixx coming in in a few minutes.  We've got a very busy morning here.  Yes.  It's Morning Zoo, bit of the day, Wednesday.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  Say it again here.  These bits we think are god-awful.  Don't get confused and sit there and crank up the radio expecting to hear a fine piece  of comedy.  Oh, no.  Well.  What's the name of the show? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  The Morning what?  Our stupid Danny.  Because I'm looking at Davey the Show Killer.  Yeah.  Who is on this zoo.  It's just called the zoo.  It's just the Morning Zoo.  Morning Zoo out of Vegas.  Yeah.  Morning Zoo thing.  And I'm looking, and there's a Davey the Show Killer dressed up like Borat in the Borat  bathing suit thing.  And then I have here, it's labeled Our Stupid Danny.  It's the same costume. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Well, Danny wore the same costume at our Halloween party.  Yes, he did.  Well, this zoo show has Chet.  Oh, God.  They look like twins.  They got Chet, who I would assume is the main host.  They got Lauren.  The little female.  The hole.  The female hole to just keep everything safe.  And between the lines.  You know, the, oh, guys type of crap.  And then you got Davey the Show Killer.  Well, you can almost see their little bulletin board behind them with bit ideas. 
[01:25:00]  Jesus.  We can only enhance that.  We can get some good bits.  Oh, God.  I wish we could.  Damn.  Where?  Any comments on Davey the Show Killer or Chet or Lauren?  Well, what is Chet's helmet?  Is that a Transformers helmet?  Yeah, he's got a Transformers helmet on in this picture.  Something like that.  We're distracted by Oscar De La Hoya.  How could you not be?  Let's be honest.  He's doing the can-can in a tutu.  This is Oscar De La Hoya. 
[01:25:30]  There he is.  He's doing the can-can in a tutu.  With a white bikini top on.  That is embarrassing.  He has a feathery tutu on.  Wow.  Wow.  That's great. 
[01:26:00]  By the way, someone from their cell phone.  My name is Oscar, and I like to wear dresses.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  My name is Oscar.  My name is Oscar, and I like to wear dresses.  Do the nail polish.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Finger nail polish.  My name is Oscar, and I like wearing tutu. 
[01:26:30]  Tutu's into the can-can.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  He sexies it up, too, old Bill.  Yeah.  Finger nail polish.  Are we going to play this stupid bit, or what?  Yes.  Because now Nikki Sixx is here.  Come on.  All right.  So it's the morning zoo out of Vegas, and, well, they came up with a song called Britney  Got Fat.  Oh, God.  Based on, you know, what she looked like at the VMA.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Listen to the intro.  It's great.  It's amazing.  Here we go.  Here is your morning zoo bit of the day.  Oh, my God.  Did you see Britney Spears?  She looked so fat.  But, you know, but in a good way, kind of like more cushion for the pushing kind of  fat, you know, eager to please kind of fat.  I'd hit it.  Definitely, I'd hit that.  And then, of course, she's a single mom, so obviously she's easy.  You know, my only question is, how do I get some of that? 
[01:27:30]  I like Big Brit, and I cannot lie, with booty shorts and big thighs, when Britney walks in  with a chunky monkey gut and a cellulite covered, but I get sprung.  Britney loves cream puffs.  Cheetos her face, she's stuffed.  And panties she won't be wearing, showing her pickled hair.  And, oh, Britney, won't you get with me?  Have some feta chiti.  That skinny Lindsay Lohan boards me, but your love handles make me.  She's so horny.  Oh, she's a single mom.  Britney got it going on, eating pizza and smoking from a bong.  I want to be on you. 
[01:28:00]  Well, share some lasagna in the backseat while your kid drives my Honda.  My anaconda don't want none, unless Britney weighs a ton.  You can do Taibo or Pilates, but please don't lose that gut.  Us Weekly says you're fat, but I ain't down with that.  Britney has some more fried chicken.  Those cinnabons don't be skipping.  Tell Jenny Craig to scat, because carbs is where it's at.  Britney's got fat.  Oh, my.  Britney's got fat. 
[01:28:30]  Britney's got fat.  Britney's got fat.  Is it mandatory we hear the whole thing?  Britney's got fat.  Yeah, look, I don't want...  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  I like turtles.  Yes, turtles.  Oh, we know, we know.  Has Nicky arrived?  Yes.  Okay, so what's going to happen is he's going to listen to the green room and hear this and think we're a bunch of fruits.  And think like that's what our show is about. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you should know better.  That could be interesting.  We're not that edgy.  There's your morning zoop in of the day.  Horrid.  Britney got fat, everyone.  I can't believe shows are doing that.  Oh, I thought you were going to say I can't believe shows are actually doing stuff.  Stuff?  Yeah.  Well, if it's that kind of stuff, that is horrid.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  Can't break?  Yeah, the Oscar de la Hoya pictures kind of...  I know.  ...kind of threw off this break.  But there you go.  But there you go.  There's your morning zoop in of the day.  Britney got fat.  Nikki Sixx next, okay?  Right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  There you go. 
[01:30:00]  Nikki Sixx.  Life is beautiful.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And, of course, we got Nikki Sixx in studio.  Good morning, guys.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing good.  A little early for you, you were saying?  You need your coffee?  Yeah, I just need a coffee.  No, it's not necessarily early.  I'm up with my kids really early.  But we've been out on this book signing tour.  And it goes from this hour till midnight every night.  Wow. 
[01:30:30]  But it's good.  Yeah.  Today I'll be in three cities.  Yeah.  A thousand people last night at the Virgin Megastore for the book signing.  Wow, nice.  That's amazing.  You did one in New York already?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're doing other ones in New York?  No, that's it.  I think he's in Philly tonight, right?  Yeah, Philly.  And then I leave for Boston right after that.  Philly tonight, Boston tomorrow, I believe, if I got it right.  Yeah, and then Toronto.  And then we'll be done on this little run.  Right.  And, of course, you're talking about the book, The Heroin Diaries.  Yes.  A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rockstar. 
[01:31:00]  I got to start by saying The Dirt.  Yeah.  The book you guys wrote together, Motley Crue, all the behind-the-scenes stories, one of my  favorite rock books of all time.  It really turned out great.  So I can't wait to read The Heroin Diaries because I'm just, I got to assume it's going  to be just as good, if not better.  I think you're going to really be into it.  There's a different perspective.  It's like a fly-on-the-wall perspective for one person that's going through an addiction.  And then also, what was interesting is me reading my own diaries and seeing my own questions 
[01:31:30]  inside the diaries, what I was going through, what I was asking.  Right.  And then later, when I got away from all the drugs and alcohol, that I actually figured  that out.  But I was asking in the midst of this chaotic time.  Well, what's amazing, you know, he's got this big heroin addiction and you're still  writing in a diary.  Yeah.  That's what I find amazing.  You know, a lot of people do.  And actually, if you knew me and saw me daily, at any time in my life, you'd get it.  I always usually have a binder with me and I'm always writing in it. 
[01:32:00]  You know, I'll go out and I'll be sitting out somewhere and I'm just writing.  People are like, what are you doing?  I go, I'm writing a song.  I'm writing because I'm a writer.  It's like I want to take it all in and put it down.  Did you read some of this stuff and go, what?  What is this?  Yeah.  What was that guy thinking?  Or what was happening around me?  Right.  How were you, like, functional at that level of drug use?  Like, how did you go out and play and just perform?  Well, when you read the book, you're going to see that, you know, I had to get off of 
[01:32:30]  the heroin to get on tour.  Mm-hmm.  You know, but then other things come in.  So there's the debauchery and there's the, you know, you're going to really dig it because  everybody in the band gets to talk about it and ex-girlfriends and ex-managers and ex-record  company people, other musicians.  They finally say what they want to say years ago when you were going through that, probably.  You know, exactly.  Because they probably didn't have the balls back in the day to go, hey, dude, you're ruining  everything.  They just let you do your thing, probably.  And it was hard to get people to be honest because they don't want to hurt your feelings. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  Yeah.  So now, you know, it's like a guy's going to go, yeah, dude, you're a jackass back then.  Right.  And they're mostly going to say, no, man, you know, you were a little bit of a pain in  the ass, but, you know, you're great now.  And I'm like, that's not going to help the book.  That's not going to help people that have addiction problems if we're going to just fluff  around this thing.  Yeah.  Tell me what I was doing and how you felt about it.  Exactly.  And that way other people can relate to that.  I've read so much great stuff.  It's like, Nicky, like, you lived like a rock star.  I mean, like, when I think of a rock star, I think of a guy who did nothing but drugs 
[01:33:30]  and bang chicks.  And it's like, that's what he did all over the world.  It's like, there's just such a...  Well, you can't just do it in L.A.  I mean, you got to take it everywhere.  Yeah, that's true.  If you're not going to abuse them in Japan.  Otherwise, you're a local band.  One of my favorite stories from Dirt, I think it was you, they thought you were dead in Japan  or something.  They threw you in a dumpster.  That would be London.  London?  Get our geographics right.  That's when I was like, wow, I can't put this book down.  They thought he was dead.  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with? 
[01:34:00]  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff.  So they're like, oh, man.  And they just threw him in a dumpster in London.  Well, you know, I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants a dead rock star.  I don't think anybody wants a live rock star.  Yeah.  It's bad enough.  You don't want to have to deal with that.  Just put him in the dumpster.  Just be done with him.  And what happened?  You just woke up in the dumpster?  No, no.  I'm going to go get coffee and a bagel or something?  That sounds good, actually.  I'm going to get a bagel right now.  I mean, you know, you read about it.  You get it.  You overdose.  They don't think you're going to come back. 
[01:34:30]  They need to get rid of you.  You know, it's cool because in the book, I get to talk about that stuff, but also what  it's like now.  You know, what it's like now being a single father, raising these kids, doing for my kids  what my dad never did for me.  And, you know, I'll never say, first, I'll never apologize for any of the craziness that  Motley Crue did back in the day.  And still, you know, I'm just not going to apologize because that's who we are.  But how do your kids listen to you?  When you try to tell them to do something, you're like, ah, dad. 
[01:35:00]  No, no.  And then they show you like page 78 and go, you know, stop.  I can't listen.  No, seriously.  How does that work?  No, I mean, we have a really open, you know, relationship.  And we talk about everything.  And for my kids, the same thing as I tell kids, like last night at the book signing, they  come up and they want to know how to get off drugs or they're saying they just got out  of treatment or their brother or their father died from heroin use or coke use.  And, you know, for me, I don't want to be a preacher.  I don't want to stand up on be some like goody two-shoes guy. 
[01:35:30]  I just want to say, this is what's behind door number one.  This is what's behind door number two.  You can pick it.  Do you still get the urge?  No, absolutely not.  Really?  No.  You offer everything now?  Like drugs, alcohol, everything?  Yeah, everything.  But, I mean, I work it pretty hard, you know.  It's just like part for me of this book, you know, I give proceeds of this book to Covenant  House, which there's one right here in New York City.  And they do amazing stuff for these kids that are on the street.  And it resonates for me because I ran away as a teenager myself. 
[01:36:00]  So, how do you replace that urge?  I'm an extremely creative person.  I mean, I do photography.  I have a clothing line called Royal Underground.  You know, I have a new band, 6 a.m.  And then the soundtrack to the book.  I'm writing a novel.  I'm, you know, writing and producing.  So, you're just trying to keep busy.  Not so much.  Jesus.  Wow.  Well, I just mean, you know.  Well, because.  He's keeping busy.  Well, Jimmy, Jimmy got sober at 17?  18. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  18, he knew that this was not for him.  Yeah.  So, I replaced it with prostitutes.  It was good.  Yeah, that worked out for you?  Not well, no.  But it's that same mania you put into the one.  Yeah.  So, if you're putting that into creativity, it's like you're going to get a lot of stuff done.  Well, that prostitutes, that'd be kind of like gambling.  Yeah, in a way.  Who needs condoms?  Come on.  Snake eyes.  Oh, damn.  Crap out.  You had a few of those under a dress.  Yeah.  We got now.  We're interviewing you now.  Yeah, we have for many years.  I didn't mean to downplay it, but it seems like it would be maybe easier if you're just 
[01:37:00]  keeping yourself busy being a creative person.  Well, it's not keeping myself busy so much.  I don't understand is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I mean, I understand what you're saying.  You know, one thing about the word recovery, and people think, oh, someone's in recovery,  okay, they lost their balls.  And to me, what I recovered through recovery was actually everything that I'm doing now.  You know, you get, like, messed up.  You get sidetracked, you know, and I just want to be the best artist I can be and do  the best stuff. 
[01:37:30]  And I still want to go around the world and blow stuff up.  And I'm single, so that means that, you know, the world's my playground right now.  So, did you ever see, like, back, maybe during a moment of clarity back then, yourself as  you are right now?  Or did you think, like, that was just an impossibility that you would be clean and just...  Exactly.  I was just on Capitol Hill, talking to Washington, D.C.  Most surreal thing ever.  I was thinking to myself, what the hell happened? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, right?  How did I end up here?  I'm standing there, I'm sitting next to Congressman Patrick Kennedy.  I'm with NADAC and SAMHSA.  I'm with Dr. Wesley Clark.  We're doing satellite tours.  They're using me as a reliable source to what goes on in the street and the getting out of  it.  And I'm using them and working with them on all their statistics and all their ability  to reach mass media and kids.  And I'm sitting up there in a tie, had skulls on it, but it was still a tie. 
[01:38:30]  It's a tie.  And, you know, I'm thinking that actually I was nervous.  Yeah.  Like, I don't get nervous, go on stage or anything, but I was like, this is really important  moment right here.  I can actually do something different where you can say, you can still kick ass, you can  still rock, and you don't have to be the clown.  Right.  You know, you can do both.  You can still have a great time.  You can still do all the chicks. 
[01:39:00]  You can still, you know, drive the coolest cars.  You can do it all.  You can be rock and roll 200% and not do that stuff.  So if you do that stuff, if you drink, you do drugs, and it works for you, man, hats  off.  I think it's just great.  Me, I can't do it.  I'm just definitely the guy you don't want to be doing that.  It's interesting because the crew is just, it was the, like, definitive rock band of  the 80s. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, you guys were it after you guys, like everybody, wanted to look and sound like that.  Yeah.  We apologize for that.  Yeah.  There are a couple that are like, wow.  Yeah.  Dude, you missed the whole idea there.  Not every rock star could pull off the mascara and stuff, man.  That's what he's getting at.  You look back on that and then see where you are now and the rest of the guys, because we've  spoken with the rest of the guys in the band and stuff. 
[01:40:00]  It's such different personalities.  I think everybody just puts you, because you mentioned clown.  Everyone kind of puts Motley Crue in this category and assumes everybody is the same in  the band.  You're all just, you know, chugging down the Jack Daniels, man, and, you know, snorting  coke off hookers' backs and everything like that.  And then you talk to you guys individually and you're such different people.  Yeah.  Well, that's what makes the band, actually, is that we are all so different.  We listen to different music.  We're different personalities.  We actually should never have got together as a band because it makes no sense. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  But I think some of the greatest bands are like that.  Yeah.  You look at the who.  You look at those four guys and you go, those guys should never even talk to each other.  Much less being a band, but it makes one of the greatest bands in the world.  It was a great moment with you and I think Mick Morris was when you were on Ozzy's Don't  Blame Me.  And you guys were talking about the old tour that you did with him where he came out on  a dress.  Yeah.  And just like the back and forth debauchery between Motley Crue and Ozzy.  And like, I think it was 84, you guys toured him on Shout at the Devil. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Shout at the Devil and he had Bark at the Moon.  It was insane.  Yeah.  That's two bands that should have never talked to each other.  Yeah.  83, 84.  Yeah.  Sharon actually, you know, she basically banned us from our own dressing room.  Anywhere we went, there was like watchful eyes of Sharon Osbourne.  I remember at one point I said, Sharon, I go, you know, I got to get laid.  And she goes, you know, why are you talking to me?  I go, you won't let anybody backstage.  And I kind of, you know, pulled the, the, the, the poor baby band puppy dog eyes on her. 
[01:41:30]  And so she goes one time and one time only.  And she like grabbed my hand.  I got to walk her up to, you know, the front row and I go, I'll take that one.  And so I got one and the rest of the guys in the band are like, how'd you do that?  I go, man, I've been working on it for weeks.  I'd be like, hi, Sharon.  She was that strict where you couldn't get anybody backstage.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, you just went shopping.  I like that.  I want that one. 
[01:42:00]  Ozzy's got to get permission to jerk off.  I mean, she is the boss.  Yeah.  The boss.  But she's great though.  She's wonderful.  So is Ozzy.  She's a tyrant in a way and very sweet in a way.  But she managed that maniac for all these years.  She took Ozzy from like, you know, and he's laying in a hotel with a pizza box on his chest.  And he's stoned out.  Oh, listen, how she did it, I don't know.  I remember one time we were on tour and Mick Mars decided to hit on Sharon.  Right?  So a few years ago I had lunch with Sharon. 
[01:42:30]  I said, hey, remember the time Mick Mars kind of hit on you?  And she goes, yeah.  She goes, yeah.  She goes, I don't even sleep with my husband.  Why would I sleep with Mick Mars?  She has a sexy vibe though.  I met her like twice.  And there's a sexy vibe coming off her where you could kind of misinterpret like, wow, she kind of digs me.  But that's just, they're like, oh yeah, now I see why Ozzy.  They just moved into my neighborhood.  So to the left, Ozzy and Sharon live.  I live in the middle.  And on the right lives Alex Van Halen.  So I think what me and Alex are going to do is we're going to TP their house. 
[01:43:00]  And the rest of the neighborhood, Stepford Wives.  Yeah.  It's really scary in there.  Beverly Hills?  No, it's out, way out in the middle of nowhere.  When they told me Ozzy moved in there, I go, he's going to lose his mind.  Because it's like paint drying out here.  Really?  Yeah.  When you bring up the whole, you know, you just point and go, I want that one thing.  With the chicks and stuff back in those days and everything.  Oh yeah, all the time as radio DJs we just do that.  We say, I want that one, but it ends there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:43:30]  It's just one of those.  We have our choice of fatties.  It's awesome.  We love the piglets.  You know the ones you spit on?  Those are the ones I'm like, come on, just let me give you the first three digits of the number.  I'll figure the rest out.  I'll figure it out.  You guys, that was, you must have just sat back and thought to yourselves in the dressing room  or just hanging out writing and stuff.  Did you just look at each other and go, wow, how the hell did this happen?  And did you ever expect to be that huge? 
[01:44:00]  Because you guys were just the hugest rock band, man.  It was the videos all over MTV.  Yeah.  Livewire, one of the first ones banned from MTV when you guys did Livewire.  That was a banned video, I think.  I don't think that was banned yet.  Ah, coffee.  I remember they had to change the rules to one of their countdown shows.  It was Home Sweet Home every goddamn week.  It was just Home Sweet Home again.  You know what's interesting is rock and roll, all music, to be honest with you, jazz, funk,  everything goes up and down in popularity. 
[01:44:30]  And rock had peaked at a certain point and then gone down and reinvented itself.  So we went to go back out to do the last tour, the Carnival of Sins and the Red, White and Crew Tour.  All the promoters there were like, this is never going to work.  So we rented all the buildings ourselves, promoted it ourselves, and sold the whole thing out in five minutes.  It was unbelievable.  So, I mean, you know what, 25 years later, we're still selling out arenas. 
[01:45:00]  It's a pretty cool thing.  That is awesome.  And to be able to do a new band and a book.  Well, let's go to Sue in Connecticut, a huge fan.  All right.  Sue, we got Nikki Sixx in studio, The Heroin Diaries.  I think there's a book signing tonight at the Borders on Broad Street in Philly at 7 o'clock.  All right, what do you got, Sue?  Nikki, I have been a fan of yours since I was 15 years old.  I've been following your career for as long as I can remember.  You are awesome.  I just finished a book at 3 o'clock this morning, and it was amazing.  I learned a lot more than I did before I knew you.  I will continue to support you. 
[01:45:30]  Your career, you've come a long way.  I just wanted to let you know that.  She had a snort Coke to stay up until 3 to read it.  I love your Coke wine.  It's amazing.  The CD, 6 a.m., is also amazing.  I can't wait to see you guys on tour.  Is this your sister or something?  I saw you on the Red, White and Crew, and I had a huge banner in the second row, and it was just amazing.  And I just need to tell you that you have a fan for life.  Yeah, but did you ever go backstage?  I never had the chance to meet them.  That's good for you.  I don't know what that means.  Yes, your memory wouldn't be as fond. 
[01:46:00]  They've got me through a lot of hard times in high school.  My classmates nicknamed me Motley Sue, and to this day it's still in my yearbook, 1988.  Were you at the book signing last night?  I couldn't make the book signing because I called Virgin Records, and they told me I had to buy the book from them, and I already had the book.  So buy it again and meet Nikki Six.  What's the matter with you?  Well, let me tell you.  Obviously not that big of a fan.  Nah, that's cool.  Thank you.  I am a huge fan.  Well, you got a question, though?  Something?  You like the book?  What did you like about the book? 
[01:46:30]  I loved everything about the book.  I sympathize with you, everything that you've gone through.  I didn't realize that you have a second sister.  I'm sorry, Lisa, and that really touched my heart.  I'm just so happy that it didn't take you over.  The drug didn't take you over.  I'm glad that you survived.  I come from an alcoholic family, and I can sympathize.  Yeah, so you get it when you read the book.  You understand that part of it.  Well, thank you very much, and those are kind words.  Yeah, and basically, Nicky's saying, stop stalking them. 
[01:47:00]  Buy the book, you're shizler.  I'm going to mention my new shizler.  I was going to come see you, Nicky, but the parkway toll is 35 cents.  Just buy another copy.  Water.  Yeah, you could have met him.  Nicky needs water.  Water's with our staff.  I will try to meet him on the next door.  I'm going to have a huge banner.  I'm going to get front row.  I've got a picture of a pin that a friend drew for me who's an artist that I wanted to give  to him yesterday, but I just, you know, I'm a single.  I'm a single mother.  I couldn't get down there with another 40 bucks.  You know, I'm sorry. 
[01:47:30]  Aw, single mom.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  This is, by the way, I've got to say, this is a beautiful book.  I mean, it's like you see a book, a lot of times people kind of cheap out on it.  This thing is like a 20-pound, 400-pound color.  Nice glossy cover.  With glossy pages, and I can't stop smelling this book.  A lot of blood color in it.  A lot of blood color.  Yeah, we're actually going to do art showings with lithographs of all the artwork around  the country.  We've been getting a lot of demands for that, like blowing the art up real big. 
[01:48:00]  It's the guy, Paul Brown, who's an amazing photographer and producer and art director.  He did that, and he's just, he's so talented.  Yeah, it's really, it's like you feel like you're buying something like worth reading.  It's like, it's just beautifully done.  The photo session on the front, what we did was we covered my face with like muscles  and, you know, basically a face on top of my face, and then put the skin back on it.  And then we razorbladed that face and split open so you could see like the inside of my 
[01:48:30]  face, and it's just like I'm rotting there.  And I said, that's what, that's what, that's what was happening.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  And listen, we got to take a quick break.  More with Nikki Sixx after the break.  The Heroin Diaries is the book we're talking about, right?  The book signing is tonight at 7 o'clock at the Borders in Philly.  Broad Street.  Broad Street in Philadelphia.  Get there early.  Don't show up at 6.50 and expect to meet them.  There you go.  Get there early.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That's great.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Nikki Sixx in studio today.  Hey, hey. 
[01:49:00]  The book, The Heroin Diaries, a year in the life of a shattered rock star.  Getting rave reviews.  People are picking it up.  If you liked The Dirt, the book Nikki Sixx did with his band.  Yeah.  Motley Crue, of course.  You're going to love this one as well.  And there's great commentary.  Like, every page you open, there's something really cool like Doc McGee.  There's a great line here about when you were with Vanity.  He said, Nikki was into Vanity because she just kind of the whole Prince thing.  Rock stars are star effers. 
[01:49:30]  Nikki might just as easily have grabbed Granny from the Beverly Hills.  You know what was great is sitting down with all these people before they did their commentary  and saying, be as brutal and honest as you can.  Because there's a lot of humor in it.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of, you know, there's good stuff and bad stuff.  I mean, it's...  Anyone you want to punch in the face?  Go, oh, man, dude.  The only people I was like, I almost took a couple people out of the book because they  were being too nice. 
[01:50:00]  I was like, come on, dude, get real.  You remember.  Tell the truth.  And a lot of people, to be honest with you, which, you know, I can't even believe it,  would return my calls, certain artists, and would say, yeah, man, I want to be involved.  You know, proceeds are going to a charity.  That's really cool, Nikki.  You know, you're doing this thing for the kids on the street, and it's going to help people.  And then they would go AWOL, because then I'd get a phone call from a manager.  Well, you know, they did the same stuff as you, but they don't want anybody to know. 
[01:50:30]  And I go, that's why you're in the wimp section, you know, in the music stores.  You're just like, come on, man.  Hey, we went to get the wiffle ball bat.  Yeah, that was...  As soon as we went to break, we're like, Nikki, your game is one of the greatest bits ever.  Yep.  Motley Crue came...  And it went on to become legendary.  Legendary.  Yeah.  We finally had to retire the wiffle ball bat.  We're showing you some of the pictures in the background.  Yeah, look at that.  Basically, it's a takeoff on one of the things you guys used to do backstage with...  What was it?  Well, you can't say what it was. 
[01:51:00]  It was a...  It was just this thing.  It was a marital aid.  Yeah, they call them marital aids.  Is that what they call them?  Yeah, but it looked like two of them glued together, let's say.  And it kind of did a tug-of-war type of thing.  Yeah.  It's like a Siamese twin kind of...  There you go.  Siamese twin.  Oh, look at it.  It's being presented like it's Babe Ruth's bat.  It was a tug-of-war thing.  I just want to set it up, and the girl that got to the middle first in this tug-of-war  competition won some kind of favor from Motley Crue. 
[01:51:30]  So...  I hope that thing...  Is that sealed under there?  No, it just slides right out.  It slides right out.  Don't touch it.  Yeah, don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  It's in glass, though.  That's been retired.  That bat hasn't been used in probably two years now, two and a half years.  I think that needs more of like a trophy case.  Yeah.  Yep.  Absolutely.  You guys aren't doing that justice.  You have to.  Look, he's scared.  Don't worry.  You won't catch anything.  Oh, I don't believe it.  It's kind of under glass.  There's like seepage out the sides.  Yeah, out the sides.  You've pointed at them. 
[01:52:00]  So you guys called it the Motley Crue Challenge, and we called it the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Yeah, I think you guys took it one step higher and took it all around the country, so you  guys are kind of like rock stars.  And just like you, we kind of grew up and realized, you know what, we've got to stop  this, or we're not going to be able to do a radio show anymore.  That's right.  We finally realized that it wasn't a good thing.  And then Ann and I talk, and we're like, we can't believe we used to do this on regular  radio.  Yeah.  Amazed.  I mean, look at the pictures.  How do you even describe that on regular radio?  Things have changed, haven't they? 
[01:52:30]  They have.  But you guys, you know, you have a forum for your insanity somewhere.  Yeah, that we know about.  A lot of people are requesting that.  I was just going to talk about the girls on the road and stuff.  Obviously, you guys, legendary.  Do you even have an idea of a roundabout figure as far as numbers go?  Or was it just a blur?  I'm a base player.  I can't count past four.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:53:00]  Let's take a call.  You see how I dodged that?  You really did dodge it.  I'm good, right?  That just means so many.  All right, then let's play this for Nicky.  A lot of people are requesting this today.  It's one of our favorite clips.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get-together in five years.  The Motley Crue.  That was one of the greatest intros ever, man.  We had to have played that 20 times. 
[01:53:30]  Larry's great.  Their first get-together.  It's like it's four old ladies on a coffee cliff.  The Motley Crue.  I love that part.  I wanted to change the name of the band after that.  To The Motley Crue.  To The Motley Crue.  Oh, God.  He's classic, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He actually knows a lot of the songs, believe it or not.  Did he really?  Yeah, we were talking about it.  Because when we saw it, we were watching the interview and everything.  It was a big thing.  So we're watching it and just going, oh, my God.  Larry is hysterical.  He's just the Motley Crue. 
[01:54:00]  He's great.  That's one of my...  I've got a few things that I've always had on a list that I've wanted to do.  One was to play with the Rolling Stones we did.  One was to play bass in Aerosmith.  And on my birthday, I got to play on this last tour with Motley Crue and Aerosmith.  Got to play bass on stage with them.  And another one is to, as an artist alone, not as a band member, to go on Larry King's show.  So when I hear that, it's just like...  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Let's go to Chicago.  Steve has something for Nikki Sixx.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was just calling.  I've been a heroin addict for shit about...  Whoa, hey, hey.  Oh, I can't say that.  Well, we just want everyone to be able to hear you.  So Steve's calling from Chicago.  You've been on heroin for a long time?  Yeah, actually, I've been in a methadone clinic for about a year and a half now.  That's hard to get off.  Actually, that's what I was calling for, man.  I was wanting to know how you actually started living your life after you quit. 
[01:55:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Were you still in the band at the time?  Yeah, I was.  Have you been in treatment?  Actually, I haven't really been to a therapist or anything, but I have a counselor at the  methadone clinic who was an addict for 30-some years or something like that who was trying  to help me.  Do you have insurance?  No.  So you can't get treatment?  No.  So you have to do outpatient?  I've been here for...  What's that?  So you have to do outpatient stuff like methadone?  Yeah, that's where I'm at right now.  I've been there for a year and a half, though, and it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.  There's supposedly, and I can't speak really knowing, but I've been talking to some people 
[01:55:30]  when I was in Washington, D.C., and there's some opiate blockers that are available now  where you can take them and that'll help you wean off of the methadone.  That's the hardest thing to get off of, even more than the heroin.  Yes.  Because it's synthetic and it gets into your bones, as you know.  It's ridiculous.  You know, I go there, I wake up at 6 in the morning, I can't even sleep in no more, you  know what I'm saying?  It wakes me up almost, you know.  Yeah.  So it's just ridiculous.  I was just seeing what somebody in your position, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:56:00]  Everybody's looking up to you to be on your game or whatever, you know.  This is what I would suggest.  I couldn't imagine that.  This is what I'd suggest, just from my experience, is find a way to block the opiates somehow so that  you can get some clarity in whatever you have to do, and then get yourself  into some kind of a therapy program so you can figure out what it is that's driven you  there in the first place.  Because you take the drugs away, bro, you're just going to feel bad.  You've got to figure out what's making you feel bad so you can get on with your life.  You're exactly right.  You know, because I've been sitting there, it's so damn hard to say you're going to 
[01:56:30]  quit forever, too.  That's the main thing I'm having a problem with, you know what I'm saying?  Get that out of your head.  That's just being stupid.  It is.  It's just being stupid.  I've had relapse because of that exact thought.  I remember going, well, when I'm 70, I'll be sitting on the beach with a, you know,  a margarita, and I'm going, okay, I'm 30, and I'm sitting, so I've got 40 years until  I can drink again, and then I'm just pissed.  So, you know, what you should do today is just, you've already been to the methadone  clinic today, is just you need to do anything and everything in your power to get something 
[01:57:00]  to block that or wean off of that, and then get off and change all your friends and change  where you live and get into therapy, bro, and you can do it.  Man, I appreciate it.  Hey, you coming to Chicago anytime, too, with that book?  I was just, I was just, I was just through there.  Chicago?  Yeah.  Oops.  Of course you were.  You missed it.  Yeah, you missed it.  Hey, good luck, bro.  Good luck.  Hey, thank you guys, man.  I appreciate having me on, man.  All right.  Hey, man, can I just, before we go there, because I say there's a lot of entries about the Park  Meridian Hotel, which is right across the street from where we are. 
[01:57:30]  You haven't been there in a long time.  It's from 87, and it's like, you're just talking here about the vanity showing up.  Like, I know she's going to say something to embarrass me, and I'm like, even when you're  a rock star, you've got to worry about the broad run in her mouth and embarrassing you.  It's like, it doesn't change for anyone.  Yeah, but you know what?  If she wrote the book, she'd say, Nikki's going to show up.  I hope he doesn't say anything to embarrass me.  This is great, though.  This is really honest, man.  This is really, really interesting.  Did you find out what got you on heroin?  Like, you gave that guy advice and said, you know, you need to do that. 
[01:58:00]  Was it your childhood or something?  You know what?  It sounds new age and sounds, you know, kind of goofy, especially sitting here being a  bunch of guys.  But what it was for me was I, you know, I call it peeling the onion.  You get back all the way to the core.  My mom left when, my dad left when I was three, never knew the guy, only ever heard he was jackass.  That's all I ever heard about the guy.  So I'm growing up going, yeah, my dad's, you know, my dad's a jerk.  And then my mom, she basically was wild. 
[01:58:30]  And I ended up, she left about when I was six.  Wow.  So then I'm with my grandparents.  So I'm going, okay, so dad's a jackass.  Mom don't care.  And then as my grandparents were moving around, moving around, and I didn't even know what  that did to me.  Yeah, I was going to ask you, did you have any clue that that was screwing you up in  any way, shape or form?  You just thought, eh.  No, and then like later you start, you know, going like, you know, that, that, that girl  will fulfill that feeling.  That drug will fulfill that feeling.  That amount of success will make me feel like I didn't have those feelings. 
[01:59:00]  And, you know, then all of a sudden everything blows up and we're like, you know, the wiffle  bat kings of the world.  And all of a sudden one day I'm sitting there and I start, the bottom starts to fall out  and I don't know what it is.  And then, you know, you get through it and you go, okay, let's go all the way back.  Like I told the guy, get off the drugs, get to the core and then live your life.  It's not so hard.  It's hard, but it's not so hard.  You know what I found out? 
[01:59:30]  I talked to these kids and I work with the kids at Covenant House and these kids have it  hard.  The guy we just talked to, he has it hard.  He's been on methadone for years.  Living in the street, that's really hard.  You know, I'm very fortunate.  When I peel the onion back, I go, okay, I got some issues.  Yeah, I was a runaway.  Yeah, I had to sleep on people's couches.  Yeah, I had to sleep in some pretty weird places.  Yeah, I had some mixed up feelings and hormones and teenage angst.  But in the end, I got to get to the core of it.  It wasn't so bad that it was worth to kill myself over. 
[02:00:00]  And that's what, you know, kids find out.  But if they, I'll tell you what, if you wait till you're 30, you got 30 years of onion  to peel.  And if you wait till you're 40, you got more.  And if you do it when you're a teenager, it's a lot easier than waiting till you're like  the guy we just talked to who's like, man, if I would have cut this off when I was 11,  12, 13 years old, I wouldn't be having to call in and say what I'm saying.  He would have been able to deal with it then and get on with it.  Have you ever met your dad? 
[02:00:30]  Never met him.  Do you know where he is?  In a grave.  Oh, okay.  I found his grave.  And you know what?  I went there to piss on him.  Did he know what you became?  Nope.  No clue.  Nope.  And you went there to?  I went there to piss on his grave.  I finally found him.  I went there to piss on his grave.  And I just looked down and I said, you know what?  I forgive you.  Actually, you blew it.  Because I'm a pretty good son.  And I walked away and I let go of it.  And I'm forgiving my mom.  We've made amends.  Life's good.  But I got kids of my own.  I don't have time to be mucking around in the past anymore. 
[02:01:00]  I got to stay in the present.  But this is a little strange because we got Howie.  Howie.  Hey.  How you doing?  We're Howie Mandel from Deal and Ho Deal.  We got Nikki Sixx from The Motley Crew in studio.  We're talking about addiction.  Hi, Nikki.  How you doing?  How's Hidden Hills?  Too bad.  Congratulations on the book, man.  I've been listening to your tour.  I'm going out to buy the book today.  And congratulations on your life and turning that around.  Thank you.  Do you guys know each other? 
[02:01:30]  Well, we live in the same neighborhood.  Wow.  You guys.  I've been being nice, you know, because Ozzy moved in there, right?  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  Ozzy's in my backyard.  Oh, dude.  I'm so sorry.  He's literally in his backyard.  He can't get him out.  You know, I've been being respectful and haven't been telling everybody you live there now.  But we're TPing you now.  Yeah.  You'll know who it is now.  This is a wild neighborhood.  Really?  You got Nikki Sixx.  You got Ozzy.  You got Howie Mandel.  Who was the other person?  I forgot.  Oh, and Alex Van Halen. 
[02:02:00]  Who else lives in there, Howie?  Melissa Etheridge is here.  Oh, she does.  I'm the only one that can't play a lick of music.  No.  It's a bunch of musicians and Howie.  No, that's actually not true.  That'd be two of us.  Damn, Howie.  Well, you got your, what is this, a live show?  Yeah, a live deal or no deal tonight.  Tonight, we're giving away a million dollars live and we're starting this million dollar  mission where every time somebody doesn't win the million, we're going to add another 
[02:02:30]  case.  So tonight may be the night.  So if the person tonight doesn't win a million, we're going to bring out another person and  then, and then there'll be two cases out of 26 and then three cases out of 26 and four.  We got to give away this million bucks.  You're a little nervous about the live thing?  No, because it's just like, people don't realize this, I'm doing this radio interview  live.  Wow.  I didn't even think of that.  Good point.  Good point, sir.  We stand corrected. 
[02:03:00]  I didn't know we were live.  I'm feeling nervous now.  Now I'm all nervous too.  I'm all nervous.  I thought we taped this every day.  Played it at noon.  Howie, you ever do heroin with Nikki Sixx?  No.  No, no.  But you, we've, we've got, we've got, you know, that, that recovery thing in common.  Yes.  Well, I don't know.  From OCD.  I don't know if that's the thing.  I have OCD.  I'm not recovering.  I just can't get over it.  But I, why, why, why, Nikki?  I was kidding.  Oh, you were kidding? 
[02:03:30]  You know, you know what, you know what's, you know what's the worst thing is?  When a bass player tries to be funny with a comedian.  It's just like, and then, and then he gets all serious and he's like.  Well, because Howie's like, what does he know?  What does he know?  Yeah, actually got nervous.  I've been listening to you, so you've been on that coast for a couple days.  You've acclimated to that time.  For me, it's like 5.45 in the morning.  I don't even know what I'm saying.  I know exactly.  Howie, with your OCD issues, have you ever even just shared a gentleman?  Or would that be just insane?  No, I've never actually shared. 
[02:04:00]  And in my younger years, I've never.  That's what I mean, in your younger years, of course.  Yes, I never shared.  I wouldn't share anything.  It was all me.  Me, me, me, me, me, me.  It was all me.  I'm actually, it's early in the morning here and I'm locked in.  My wife just bought me this coolest thing.  I got this Brill toilet thing.  I got a new thing where you wave your hand over it and the plastic goes around the seat automatically.  That's a new thing that went on your new cool toilet. 
[02:04:30]  I got to explain to Nicky.  We had Howie on, I guess, last week and we were obsessed with this toilet thing.  He's got the coolest toilet.  He's got the coolest toilet.  He stayed in the presidential suite of one of these hotels in New York and there was this toilet where the lid goes up automatically.  You don't do nothing but just sit there.  But is it as cool as the ones in Japan?  That's exactly the one it is.  Oh, I hate you.  I wanted that.  The Toto?  You live right near and just go over and take a dump. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah, right.  Can I come over?  You come over and look at it.  Look at it.  The thing is that my wife said I was going to put one, I was going to buy a bunch of them and I said I want to put one in the guest, like we have the guest bathroom downstairs and she said she doesn't want people lingering.  Like people are going to come over to our house just to crap.  Well, I mean, if Ozzy hears this, he's coming over.  Yeah, you got to watch that too.  I bet that's not, I bet that's a mess. 
[02:05:30]  Did Neil Ratt or Toto call you from last week?  Because you guys deserve three toilets.  I think they should be shipping some toilet stuff.  You know, you got to put me on that list because every time I go to Japan, as soon as I get into the hotel, I just go sit down on that toilet.  I'm like, this is, I made it.  I don't care about the garden.  I don't care about the Staples Center.  It's the toilet.  The toilet is where it's at.  You don't press the front wash.  That's the big problem.  I accidentally pressed front wash.  It works like a speed bag. 
[02:06:00]  That's got to hurt a little bit.  It did, and I didn't want to get up because I didn't want to soak the room.  He loves his toilet, but it sounds great.  All right, we're running out of time on this part of the show there.  Howie, the big headline, Deal or No Deal is live tonight, and you're going to be giving away that million dollars sooner than later, right?  The million dollar mission starts tonight.  We'll keep adding, so keep watching.  Nicky, congratulations on the book.  I'll see you back in the hood. 
[02:06:30]  Yes, sir.  Thanks, bud, for calling.  Good luck on that tonight.  Good luck.  Bye-bye.  See you, man.  Howie Mandel.  He's a great guy.  He's becoming a regular on the show.  We love the guy.  He's so funny, man.  He's nuts, and we love that about him.  Yeah.  He told us a great story once about how he was, you know, he has these panic attacks, and he had his child in the car with him, and something happened.  Remember that?  And he was trying to walk.  Oh, his kid had to go to the bathroom.  So he parks on the side of the highway.  He's on the side of the highway, but there was kind of a big, steep drop-off, and it kind of rolled down the hill, and he's trying to come back up, and he's having a panic attack. 
[02:07:00]  He thought he was having a heart attack.  Well, because of the OCD issues, his child there, I don't know if it was a boy or a girl, was just doing what a little person would do.  Yeah, all over Howie as he's falling down the hill.  Yeah, he tried to get to a point where the kid could do what it had to do.  Which, seeing him, knowing him, you would just start laughing.  Yeah.  Like, not at him, just at irony. 
[02:07:30]  Yep.  All right, we've got to get the big plug in.  Nicky Six, he's always a great guest.  The Heroin Diaries, A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rockstar.  It's getting really a real good buzz on this book.  And check out the record, too, because we scored a soundtrack to the record, and I started a new band called 6AM around it, and we got a big hit single.  You know, we played a little taste of that, and someone wrote on this feedback, they had no idea that was your band.  No clue.  Yeah.  Because you're calling it 6AM.  It's called 6AM.  But you're spelling 6-S-I-X-X.  And Nicky, did anyone ever tell you, there's only one X in 6? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, now I find out we're not live, and I misspelled my name.  You misspelled your name for so long.  And I got a girl's first name, so it's like, I'm just, I'm, see, I should have never made it.  Yep.  Send me back to the farm.  And Nicky6.net with two Ks and two Xs.  And the book signings is tonight in Philadelphia, Borders, on, what street is it on?  Broad Street.  Broad Street, and I think it's at 7 o'clock signing, and then tomorrow afternoon, is it in Boston?  Yeah, Borders, Downtown Crossing, 1 o'clock tomorrow in Boston.  The book is a, it's a great book, and it's honest, and it's really funny, and he lets people slam them. 
[02:08:30]  Nobody writes a book where they let people slam them, which is just, the two Doc McGee things I've read already, I love this book.  Yeah, I can't wait to read it.  Hey, thank you guys, it's been, I've had a blast as always, and next time I come back, I'll come back and hang out, and we'll see what we can, trouble we can get into.  All right, very cool.  Absolutely.  Nicky6, everyone.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day, we'll see you tomorrow.  Later.  The virus is spreading. 
[02:09:00]  Opium Anthony.  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio in our brand new state-of-the-art studio.  Really?  Oh.  What are you laughing at?  Crystal, I just, I'm starting to laugh at how ridiculous this is.  What, what we do?  Yeah, like, the whole, we get here, it's six o'clock, we play Ecstasy of Gold, and then there's like a little promo thing of, little clips of our show, and then Rage plays and we come on. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And we do a show.  Yeah.  Then we pretty much end the show.  We say goodbye, we thank the guests, we thank the listeners, and we leave.  Yeah.  And then, 15 minutes later, we start it all over again.  And make believe we haven't done a show yet.  It's the dumbest thing ever.  Look, I try to get rid of the playing of Ecstasy of Gold for the XM listeners. 
[02:10:00]  I know, people get angry.  And they fucking bitched and complained.  I'm like, all right.  It's not even that.  Because just before 6 a.m., we play Ecstasy of Gold for the commercial radio stations.  Yeah.  I don't know why we don't play it for, oh, because that would fuck up the massive fucking clock they got down at the compound.  That's right.  And then you say the F word, and I freak out every day.  It's the same thing every day.  I know.  By the way, you'll rarely hear me curse first on this show.  Because you're not sure if we're not on regular radio.  Yeah, because I'm just talking again like we're on the radio because we just did the show. 
[02:10:30]  And then we come back and we start it all over again.  It's like Groundhog's Day in here.  Yeah, well, I mean, Ecstasy of Gold should play for everybody.  XM and regular radio starting at 5.55.  Right now it plays just for the commercial radio listeners at 5.55.  Because then the clock that's set that they can't change because that would just throw off the universe.  Right.  Down at the XM compound.  The earth would spin off its axis.  They haven't been able to figure that out.  So they pick us up live right at 6 when the show intro starts. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  So you have to play Ecstasy of Gold for the XM listeners in between shows because they like that.  Yeah.  We've done kind of a survey thing.  For the most part, they want to hear that still.  They want to hear it.  We really did try to get rid of it.  And people were like, no.  They're incensed.  I think what they like about that, they just know the show's about to start.  They're doing the last minute thing, getting their coffee or what have you.  I don't know.  Getting all set up and situated. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  To listen.  And we are running around doing production and whatnot.  Right.  Things now that they could squeeze in between the two shows.  Yeah.  Well.  Any minute they can get us.  By the way, we're heading over to the new studio today.  Ant and I are going to check it out.  I checked it out about a month ago and it was amazing.  And now I'm looking at pictures.  Well, actually, I'm not going to be able to check it out until tomorrow.  Why?  Because Wednesday is the day I got a lot of stuff to do. 
[02:12:00]  And I got to get out of the city and my car is going to be pulled up on 56th.  What if we get out of here early so you can check out the new studio?  If we got out of here early, I would just drive out earlier.  I've got to get out of this city.  All right.  Well, we'll check it out tomorrow.  I will go tomorrow.  Jimmy and I will check out the new studio.  Because Wednesday is a very busy day for Anthony.  Dude, me do life therapy.  Dude.  Oh, you do?  I looked at this studio a month ago.  I don't even recognize it anymore.  And a month ago, it was pretty impressive.  I'm looking at flat screens all over the place.  One, two, three, four, five in this picture alone. 
[02:12:30]  How many?  And I'm assuming there's got to be more than that.  Iraq?  They're going to put in about 12 flat screens.  Oh, that's great.  So we're going to have 12 different TVs to watch?  That's good.  That's what I always wanted from a radio show.  Here, we almost have it.  We have one, two, three.  We have four.  I want TVs everywhere so we can play off what's going on out there.  Well, they have it like that, apparently, because when the merger happens, that's kind  of what Howard wanted.  So when they fire us.  This will be the studio he uses.  Howard.  They're probably building it to his specs.  I know.  We're like, hey, how come that's not like that? 
[02:13:00]  No reason.  But we didn't ask.  No, this is better.  It's great.  Howard.  What are the initials on this?  What's the AL for on the third mic seat?  Ah, nothing.  That's just, that's for you, Jim.  Howard has pretty much given up on his own show.  I was reading stuff about his show the other day.  Yeah.  People are like, he sounds like he doesn't give a shit anymore, and he's letting everyone  else just talk on his show.  Yeah.  He's done.  The guy's done.  What happened there?  Oh, I guess we're supposed to, because Jason from Rye, a faithful listener of the show, 
[02:13:30]  he wants to know when we go back to doing the walk and going over there.  I think it's Monday.  I think we're shooting for Monday.  Monday?  We're going to be in the new joint.  Yeah.  But that could change, because we were supposed to be in there a month ago.  Oh, long ago.  We were supposed to be in there a year ago.  Years ago.  Right, right, right.  But it's looking like Monday?  Yes.  I guess every day we'll have an update, but right now it's Monday.  Ask us tomorrow.  It could be a different day.  Yeah.  Can I say that I want to move to that neighborhood that Nikki Sixx and Ozzy and Howie Mandela would? 
[02:14:00]  Who wouldn't?  You buy a place there, it's going to cost you $95,000, $100,000?  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  That will make me laugh for the rest of my stupid life.  But you know why?  Because it really happened.  People don't even know why we do that, do they?  No.  No, no.  I don't think anyone really realizes why that was done.  For the people that linger longer, they know.  I don't even know if we were told it.  And that's another thing that annoys some of the asses out there that I say linger longer. 
[02:14:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Oos.  Yeah.  Oos.  Just oos.  Hey, are the bleachers up for the fans?  Not yet.  Not yet.  We're going to have bleachers.  It's going to look like the set of Wonderama.  Yeah.  Good.  Hopefully we'll have the same audience.  I'm going to be Bob McAllister, but cut a fucking dickhole in my trousers with my fucking  stupid elbowed suit jacket.  I'd like to play the snake can game with the bottom cut out of one of the snake cans.  That's right.  Boing.  Reach in.  You sing walk-a-doo, walk-a-doo while I do what we call memory removal. 
[02:15:00]  Pretend you're eating cotton candy.  Because kids are people.  People too.  Whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo.  Was that what he said?  Walk-a-doo?  No.  I was saying whack-a-doo.  No.  No.  But I'm saying what would Bob McAllister say.  Yeah, whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo, and you'd win an Apollo bicycle.  Yeah, let's find whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo today.  Do we have that on?  Because that's what my boyhood will be.  Hey, I got an observation.  I hope the listeners are noticing the excitement, and I'll tell you why you hear a little more  excitement in our voices.  We're gay.  Because we're getting the fuck out of here. 
[02:15:30]  For a couple hours on a daily basis.  Because this just sucks the creativity out of your soul after a while.  But we're still going to be in here from six to nine.  Yeah, but we just need to do the two shows like we used to do.  It was a nice break to do it all from one studio, but we need to get the fuck out of here.  Just in time for me to wear my giant parka.  Because I hate the winter.  How many people do you think are going to walk headfirst into those glass fucking windows 
[02:16:00]  that surround...  They had to put the tape on them.  They put the big blue X's on the glass.  How many people are just going to walk headfirst into that, Steve?  Well, they should put like an ONA insignia, like O.P. and Anthony or something, but in  a light blue.  An etched glass or something.  Yeah, they should.  That'll figure it out.  Not that they want to do that, because why that...  And by the way, because now I'm going to have to hear from Tom, I don't mind being  here.  And I'll say I don't mind being here from like six to nine.  You know, we get an opportunity to talk to a lot more people.  I like that. 
[02:16:30]  And we're still able to be creative enough to get the job done, but at nine, we need  to get the fuck out of here.  He doesn't listen to this shit anyway.  He does.  Yes, he does.  Does he?  Yeah, he's got spies.  Spies?  Dude, we'll say some obscure thing in the middle of like, you know, the 10 o'clock hour that  was 10 seconds, and I'll get a phone call like, oh, what?  I didn't think he was listening.  Hi, Tom.  Because there's a lot of stuff we wanted to do for the XM show we weren't allowed to  do because we're on CBS's property, which was just completely insane to me. 
[02:17:00]  Tom's a fanboy.  That's what he is.  A fanboy.  Tom is fucking one step removed from Oscar De La Hoya, except he doesn't have the physique.  De La Hoya.  De La Hoya.  Yeah, apparently there are going to be six broadcast quality cameras for PalTalk that  I will control.  I have control.  Know what that means?  What?  It's time to get hairdressers for everybody.  Yes.  Who, who?  Who, who?  Now that we got broadcast quality cameras robbing.  I'm going to be like, stand by three.  So I've got to do my hair and makeup every morning. 
[02:17:30]  Three.  Stand by four.  Go to four.  Right.  Stand by one.  Go to one.  And supposedly the Zoom is great.  Yeah.  It's going to be fantastic.  What do you got, Dan?  Yeah, they were showing us the capabilities.  There was a bucket across the room from the camera and he zoomed in and he could read the  barcode on the bucket 20 feet away.  For PalTalk?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's what we needed.  We got one other issue with the brand new studio.  We got to decide how much rent we're going to charge the Ron and Fez show to use our studio 
[02:18:00]  every day.  That's true.  I know.  They were getting it for dirt cheap when we had the old studio.  They were squatting, my friend.  Kind of crappy.  The squatting days are over.  You pay rent.  I thought they were paying the minimum, like Baltic and Mediterranean rent.  Dude.  I want to charge them boardwalk and park place rent now.  Or at least Marvin Gardens.  Marvin Gardens.  They were squatting and we want our rent now.  Yep.  We want rent. 
[02:18:30]  That's it, Ronnie B.  You either pay up or you sit with that guy from the Broadway channel and tolerate him.  That's the way it is.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, that's my camera control.  What is it?  Let me look at it.  Wow.  That's like a joystick with a button and then there's a bunch of buttons and knobs.  I love buttons, knobs, and joysticks.  It looks like a poo button.  What?  Ling-a-ling-a.  It looks like a butt plug on a friggin' white platform.  A butt plug, too.  Ling-a-ling-a. 
[02:19:00]  By the way, I don't need sound boards or that thing, but I would like, I have nothing  in front of me.  I would like.  Moving on with the show.  Oh, Jimmy.  I could be, I have a computer screen in front of me and look.  I would be, I think I could be helpful.  Yeah?  Yeah, a computer screen.  Yeah, wonderful.  A computer screen?  What, like, that I could, that I could.  Just the screen.  No.  Everybody has.  And Scout.  I know.  All the guys have.  I know.  Why doesn't Jimmy have that?  I don't have nothing. 
[02:19:30]  Poor Jimmy.  What's that?  In this area here.  I've had plenty of TVs.  I don't want that in my life right now.  What I happen to want is a fucking computer monitor screen that I can scroll around and  go, hey, guys, look what's on my screen.  Yeah.  And you can go, ah, something for the show.  Yeah.  Dude, my, my farts are horrendous.  Oh, good.  Oh, God damn it.  I don't feel guilty now.  I stand standing right behind you.  Oh, Jimmy, don't squeeze it out.  Like, you made a face like you were shitting.  I did.  I just, I just fucking chimed in.  Thank you.  Can you do one, a lap around the, uh.  A lap around the ring there. 
[02:20:00]  I'm just not a guy.  Thank you, Iraq.  There goes Iraq.  Don't run.  All around.  You're going to hurt you.  Hey, I, well, are you spraying that?  It's just dripping out.  No, I'm spraying.  Thank you, Elo, by the way, for the text.  What did he write?  What did he write?  You get anything you want.  Wow.  Except a raise or respect.  Yeah.  Doesn't need to say that.  Or job security.  Or job security.  Well, now that I know that Logan is listening, let me tell you a little something about Logan.  Uh, he's drunk.  When we move into the brand new state-of-the-art studio that you built, uh, just for us, I'm 
[02:20:30]  almost willing to forget and move on.  Oh.  Oh.  Almost.  You're almost there, sir.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Are we almost back to, like, hanging out?  Almost.  Having a couple of drinks?  I remember.  Almost.  I remember one of the best times I had with Elo was right after, I believe it was, um,  uh, Letterman, I think?  Wow.  And we went to the, uh, the hotel room.  We went to Bob Eatman's hotel room to watch the broadcast. 
[02:21:00]  And me and Elo cleaned out Bob Eatman's minibar of the booze.  He must have shit himself when he got the bill.  No.  He shit himself when Elo, he had to be hammered when we went to the restaurant after the Letterman  appearance.  Oh, right, right.  And decided to, uh, to order the $1,200 bottle of wine to celebrate us being on Letterman.  And then followed it up with a $600 bottle of wine.  Because there wasn't enough wine in the bottle, the $1,200 bottle. 
[02:21:30]  And they were out of $1,200 bottles because they only had one.  Bob couldn't enjoy his meal.  He was freaking out.  And then, uh, Logan, a classic, classic corporate move goes, Bob, relax, we'll split the bill.  And to this day, he has not split the bill.  God bless Eric Logan.  He left it, uh, to Bob Eatman to pay.  And Bob actually has sent invoices to Eric Logan looking for his half of this huge bill.  So, by the way, according to Eric, uh, to tell Opie, I still have issues. 
[02:22:00]  So maybe your issues are going away, but apparently no or not.  Wait, he has issues with me?  I, I don't know.  He could be talking about Down Syndrome, Hairdue Magazine.  He's just, yeah, he's got a lot of issues of that.  It's not even job related.  He just has issues.  Believe me.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I have issues.  All right, all right.  We know.  It's ism monthly.  This week, it's alcohol.  So we're almost out of here.  We can't wait.  I guess Monday's the day.  Hey, it's, uh, wake up your spouse Monday. 
[02:22:30]  I know it's, uh, it's too late to do the bill.  What did I say?  Monday?  Monday.  Holy Jesus.  That would have sucked.  No kidding.  Wow.  I just keep looking forward to this coming Monday.  We'd have been in on, like, Sunday thinking it was Friday.  Oh, by the way, they want us to train over the weekend in the new studio.  Thank you.  I, boy, go in there Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  That ain't happening.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We will do it live on our show Monday.  Get at it.  It'll be a disaster.  You'll hear old school me, uh, not laughing, screaming and yelling.  Here's breaking shit that doesn't work. 
[02:23:00]  Here's something you'll never hear.  Oh, drive into the city this Sunday, uh, so we can try out the new studio?  Yeah, yeah, I'll be, I'll be right in.  Yeah, sure.  Never, ever will you hear that on the phone?  No.  Like, I'm going to drive back into the fucking city on my precious weekends.  Why don't we, uh, but let's make sure the staff is there.  Have fun, guys.  Uh, the staff should be there to train, uh, on Saturdays. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Saturday and Sunday.  I'm going to need you to go ahead and come on in Sunday.  Yeah.  All right, listen, uh, don't, Christine can't go anywhere.  We're leading up to the Christine phone call, but first, let's play the, uh, the brand new  sweeper for, uh, Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Yes.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday. 
[02:24:00]  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  All right, don't be an anthony.  All right, I'm going to break and kill you.  By the way, that was all from today.  That's a montage of all the people that got woken up today.  What's with the Jimmy Durante voice?  Ah, cha-cha-cha-cha.  Remember Michael J. Fox did that fucking terrible movie with, uh, who's the old cunt?  It was Kirk Douglas, I think. 
[02:24:30]  And fucking, he played like, uh, he played a guy who was a Jimmy Durante.  They were all being nice to Kirk Douglas because he was rich.  And Michael J. Fox was a Jimmy Durante.  Wow.  Jimmy Durante.  Ah, cha-cha.  And I got the douche chills watching.  Like, just to act that.  Yeah, I could kind of see it.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Like, he's trying to make the old guy like him.  And he's just doing, you remember we used to do this?  And he's doing Durante.  What year, man?  Because, you know, Michael J. Fox kind of had a career.  A few movies.  It's like pages long.  Greedy, it was called. 
[02:25:00]  Greedy.  Yes, okay.  All right.  I never saw it.  Hey, Bob McAllister, you're going to get your mouth fucked.  Hurry.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, we're going to lose Christine, and I'm heading towards something here.  Oh, okay.  I'm focused for a second.  Christine, get your mouth fucked.  I roll with an iron helmet.  Oh, shit.  Swim walk.  You do come up with them.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Someone sent in the Wonderama clip. 
[02:25:30]  It's on.  There's some feedback.  Wow.  If you need help.  All right, here we go.  So, we had Dynamite Guy wake up his wife, I guess.  Yes.  Not Jimmy J.J. Walker, either.  Right, right.  It's a guy that's using a quarter stick of dynamite.  Look, I plowed through that one, Dan.  I like the way you said Jimmy J.J. Walker.  Like, you were going to go with, what's his real name, Jimmy Walker?  Jimmy Walker, yes.  Dynamite.  Dynamite.  Was the, um. 
[02:26:00]  I heard him, Ralph.  Jimmy J.J. Walker, Alice.  You have no sense of humor.  So, dude with Dynamite woke up his wife.  Yes.  This is how it went down about, uh.  A few hours ago.  Three hours ago.  Jerry, you got a stick of Dynamite?  Quarter stick.  Oh, quarter stick.  Okay.  And you want to wake her up with, uh, that. 
[02:26:30]  How are you going to do it?  Where are you going to put it?  Uh, inside a pot, like that, so she doesn't get hurt.  But it'll be loud.  And, and how, how close are you going to put it to her?  Right next to her on the bed.  No, I wouldn't put it.  No, no, no, no, no.  I wouldn't put it right next to her.  Put it on the floor.  All right.  But away from her.  Like, across the room.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, get the phone close to her, all right?  The key to wake up your spouse Wednesday, we need to hear the, the waking up part.  All right.  Jerry, uh, the show is yours.  Go ahead. 
[02:27:00]  What is it?  Oh, my God.  Although dog shit guy today was pretty funny, too.  Couldn't say dog shit on the other side.  Who is Christine?  And she, Christine was the one that was woken up by the dynamite. 
[02:27:30]  See, I had a plan the whole time.  Christine and Jersey, what's up?  I hate you guys.  That was you, right?  Huh?  That was me.  And I'm deaf now.  Thank you.  But can I just tell you, you guys screw up my life with your show.  Why?  We do.  Why?  Because everything he says is, Opie and Anthony said this today.  Opie and Anthony.  I've sat through a Patrice O'Neill show, a Jimmy Norton show, which was excruciating.  No offense.  I've had to wait in the morning to order tickets to the virus. 
[02:28:00]  I can't take it anymore.  He was on your eggnog thing.  He was the big guy that threw up last.  Well, if he threw up last, he would have won.  Yeah.  Yeah, he almost won.  And so I had to be publicly humiliated at work because everyone was like, that's your husband?  I'm like, yeah, thanks.  And now today this.  He woke you up with dynamite.  Dynamite.  Dynamite in my bedroom, which is very small.  But thanks for saving it from the bed for me anyway. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We kind of bailed you out.  He wanted to put it right next to you in the bed.  I would have killed him.  By the way, Jimmy V from Florida writes, my wife says the same shit.  He blew the ceiling fan away.  Part of the ceiling fan.  Went to shoot up in the air.  Nice.  Now, Christine.  Yeah, I'm so scared.  Yes?  There's part of the call I need to understand.  All of a sudden, you kind of start waking up and you're like, what's that?  You thought he was coming in with a candle or something? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  I have no idea.  That was her wake-up groggy.  What's that?  What was that?  Yeah, that was your groggy, what's that?  Kind of just like, what's that?  What's that?  Like, you're trying to figure out what was going on.  Blam.  And then, yeah.  It was horrible.  And you guys are to blame.  Yeah.  Well, wait till next week.  Because now, you know, people out there are already trying to figure out what to do.  Huh?  I'm going to get him back in a really bad way. 
[02:29:30]  I hope that a lot of the people that were woken up this morning, they get woken up next week as well.  Because they're not going to be expecting it.  Yeah.  No.  They think they're done with this.  No, I can't.  He feels really guilty.  He keeps calling me to make sure I'm all right because I can't hear out of my ear.  Now he's feeling bad.  Yeah, now he does feel bad.  You know, he's the star of the show today, though.  Everyone's talking about it.  I know, but guess what?  He's obsessed with you guys, and it's not normal.  I just don't think it's normal. 
[02:30:00]  It is good.  At least when he's not in strip clubs and stuff.  He's just listening to a bunch of dopes.  Yeah.  Have a silly time.  That's healthy.  Silly.  I guess so.  Silly boys.  Yeah.  I guess so, but I think it's a little unnatural.  You know what I'm saying?  We enjoy it.  Believe me.  I'm glad we do.  The more fanatic listeners, the better.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's only going to get better starting Monday.  All right, Christine.  Thanks for everything, guys.  I appreciate it.  Good evening.  Take care of that ear. 
[02:30:30]  Enjoy the ringing.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes.  Christine from New Jersey there.  Her husband rules, by the way.  He rules.  Huh?  That was a great...  Fucking husband rules.  No kidding.  Have we brought up the phantom ring on the air?  Or the phantom vibrate?  It's a new phenomenon.  What's that?  Well, I kind of discovered that it was happening, so I mentioned it.  And a few people are like, holy shit, yeah.  When you have your cell phone in your pocket, and you think it vibrates, you actually feel 
[02:31:00]  a vibration, and you grab your phone, and it's nothing.  Yep.  It's like this phantom vibrate that's going on with the cell phones.  I want this studied.  I want a grant.  All I care about is the little itching that happens in my ear.  I'm convinced it's the maddening knitting of a tumor weaving itself through my skull.  Well, again, they've brought up the, do cell phones cause brain tumors?  No, it's the wrong side.  No, the other side.  Other side?  Yeah.  Well, it's going through your head.  No, I haven't had one long enough, actually. 
[02:31:30]  No, it's an earwig or whatever.  We already determined what you got.  It still hurts?  It doesn't ever hurt.  Oh, what does it do?  An occasional itch.  Like someone's got too little, and I don't like being pinched.  But it's like, I don't.  Pinched.  Yes, I don't like being pinched.  What are they yelling at?  I don't know.  What the hell is going on out there?  What was that noise?  It sounded like a walrus.  Exactly.  We don't have Bob Kelly scheduled for today, do we? 
[02:32:00]  Bob, you know, from your lips to God's ears, we're just kidding.  Hey, hey, come on.  What was that noise?  Besides, not the sounds of work getting done.  Yeah, exactly.  Danny, what's up?  Wasn't a strange thing.  What happened?  Huh?  Oh, is that Danny?  Yeah.  What happened?  I was making fun of Pat Duffy in the office.  All right, that's work.  That's okay.  Hey, while we have you in here, the lustful sex life of a perverted nympho housewife part  one.  Oh, yeah, this is fantastic.  What is this?  Well, I think it was a listener sent a link to all these old eight-track porno tapes. 
[02:32:30]  And when I say eight-track porno tapes, it's exactly what it sounds like.  It's old audio tapes.  There's no video involved with this whatsoever.  So I'm assuming that you just listen to this in your car, in your home stereo.  And I guess you're supposed to beat off to it, but it's ridiculous.  To sound.  So it's audio porno.  It's audio porn.  All right.  Weird.  And this particular episode just had so much goodness, I figured I would just leave it  in parts.  So this is the first part. 
[02:33:00]  If it goes over, there could be a part two.  Oh, I like that.  Carol's friend calls to tell her she fucked Joe the bartender.  Oh, good.  And the dialogue is just so, it's just terrible.  All right.  Carol's saucy.  Fucking whore.  Honey.  Oh, my God.  Save that for any time a girl named Carol calls the show.  There's a whore in your building.  Carol is a whore. 
[02:33:30]  Wait.  You're going to claim that?  Fuck.  I got to claim that one.  Every time Carol, it doesn't matter.  Any Carol on the phone is going to get that sound clip.  I don't care if she's a nun.  Don't worry.  There's plenty more where that came from.  All right.  Here we go.  I want some from my machine.  Let's go.  Yes.  No machine.  Jimmy's machine.  Hello?  Carol, you fucking whore.  Honey, that's a hell of a way to talk to your best girl buddy.  What the fuck are you bitching about? 
[02:34:00]  You know damn good and well what I'm talking about, you bitch.  You fucked Joe the bartender last night and he wasn't.  The bartender.  The bartender.  Who is this, fucking Hepburn?  You put Norman's cock in your mouth, you dirty bitch.  He told you to check the phone.  He was going to look at loons and you licked his ball bag and fingered his asshole and his  prostate fell out.  The acting's horrendous.  Sounds like one of mine and Opie's live reads when we have a script.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[02:34:30]  I'm proud of my live reads.  Opie, you fucking whore.  You fucked Joe the bartender last night and he wasn't worth shit.  I sucked his joint for 30 minutes and his prick was like a piece of spaghetti.  To crown it off, the bastard had the nerve to laugh when it wouldn't come up.  But he finally admitted that you had fucked and sucked him earlier during his lunch break.  Now I'm sitting here with a banana up my hungry cunt. 
[02:35:00]  All right, that's good stuff.  We gotta play this little free FM.  Up my hungry cunt.  Hungry cunt.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Are you fucking?  And his prick was like a piece of spaghetti.  Spaghetti.  Spaghetti.  It's just like 1940s.  She got fucked on the African Queen.  How old is this fucking thing?  Fucking bogey stuck in her shitter.  Bogey. 
[02:35:30]  Put leeches on her ass and fucked her.  This is fucking terrible.  What accent is that?  It's just...  Does anybody know?  It's an accent of the 60s.  Affectation.  It's just how they were talking in the...  I would guess 60s, early 70s on this one.  My.  Well, I mean, judging from the box art on the 8-track, I mean, it was definitely early 70s.  Early 70s.  Yeah.  Big hairy muff.  Mark and Danny finds the shit.  I know.  She couldn't help it.  He grabbed her ass and she creamed. 
[02:36:00]  Here we go.  Oh, honey, baby, you know he never even looked my way.  That dirty liar.  Don't give me that shit, you bitch.  He shoved that pencil prick of his up your cunt, up your asshole and down your throat so often he could find that cave of a cunt of yours in the dark.  All right, little pussy buddy.  But when he grabbed me by the ass at the club last night, I creamed in my pants.  Wait a minute, you cock greedy bitch.  After all, I'm the one who's a divorcee and he's all alone. 
[02:36:30]  At least, Grace, you're still married and have some steady cock around.  You're alone like the top girl in a whorehouse, you bitch.  You could have at least warned me.  What am I supposed to do with their burnt out fucks after you've sucked their nuts dry?  Plus, that old pencil prick husband of mine doesn't thrill me anymore.  All right, little buddy, I'm sorry.  Next time I'll tell you.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  What an awful, unbelievable, unsexy guy.  That was written by a guy, obviously. 
[02:37:00]  See, you know what's disturbing to me when you hear this older audio?  I, in my naiveness, always, I thought like ass fucking was like a new invention.  Oh, really?  You don't want to think that your grandma or anyone that's old in your life was like doing the same shit you were doing.  You know what I mean?  Getting it up the ass.  Like feeding bananas to your hungry cunt.  I thought that was more of an invention of the 90s, you know?  It's not greedy, huh? 
[02:37:30]  Right.  Huh?  Huh?  They romanticize this shit when you watch old movies and stuff.  Yeah.  That's, uh, wow.  I didn't even know that was available.  Some kind of.  Apparently.  And how many volumes we got so far?  Well, this was like the first few minutes of just one.  This whole episode was like 35, 40 minutes long.  What are you supposed to do with this, though?  You could not possibly jerk off to that.  Jimmy, stop it.  I got like, I'll be honest, I got like four. 
[02:38:00]  No, you didn't.  I do.  I had four go.  I'm not hard, but it's snaking like a little.  You cock, greedy cunt.  You did not.  Well, she tried to tug on it for an hour.  It was like a piece of spaghetti.  I laughed at her.  By the way.  I grabbed her ass and she creamed in a pass.  Literally.  It was creamed corn.  Jay from Florida, from Wackback.  Did Jimmy Schubert get a writing credit for this?  He's got patties full of green corn and then he's got some potato flakes on your shoes.  Linger longer.  Potato flakes.  Yeah, I'm going to give you a double knuckle on your piss pump and then you're going to 
[02:38:30]  be creamed in your jeans.  Your piss pump.  Fuck, I don't even know what that means.  Fucking Schubertism.  Where is Schubert?  We need Schubertism.  Yeah, we're not making fun of him.  We want him.  I love Schubert.  You've got to call the show.  He's a fucking animal.  He needs the Schubertisms.  Uh, FYI, you guys mentioned the Phantom Vibrate cell phone.  Opie said it was dead people trying to contact us.  He said they just don't know how to speak to us.  Oh, okay.  Right, right.  And this guy, of course, writing, linger longer, which has taken off.  Mm-hmm.  All the way, May, took it up the ass after every win. 
[02:39:00]  A lot of people lingering longer with, all right, all the way, May.  All the way, May.  As she slid into home plate, some Negro was holding a baseball bat.  She took it all.  In her hungry cunt.  And a young Bill O'Reilly walked in while Grandmama was being shishkebobbed by two black  cocks the size of the Chrysler building.  Grandmama, what are you doing?  Get out of here, you little meddler.  I've got two dark seed pumpers in my mouth and asshole. 
[02:39:30]  You'll learn about this someday when you dine in Harlem.  They can't vote, but boy, can they fuck.  Jimmy with the characters lately, man.  I'm fucking, I'm the character kid.  That was my nickname in high school.  Fuck him.  What was the character yesterday?  The con.  Coach, whoever comes, I do.  Coach Jimmy, they called it.  Coach Jimmy.  Hey, Stephen Albany, when is this going to air on Sonic Theater, XM 163?  Yes.  Put that on.  The old time radio.  I fed a banana to my hungry cunt. 
[02:40:00]  This will be on Audible later.  Yes.  Say goodnight, Gracie.  And then he shit in my mouth, you silly goose.  Hey, the young O'Reilly sitting there watching his granny.  I take the cock all the way down to those plum-like balls.  That's right, Bill.  It's called melanin, and you don't have it, which would explain your little dingle.  But boy, can they give a gal a deep dicking?  Here's an apple.  Don't tell your grandfather. 
[02:40:30]  He's so surprised the cum is white.  That's right.  It's the seed of the devil.  He's pumping it into me, but I only take it in the shitter because we don't have abortions.  That's right.  He's got the black power fist in my hungry cunt.  You six-foot-eight loofus sponge using fraud, cocksucker, hypocrite jizz bucket. 
[02:41:00]  You're three years old and you're six-foot-eight, and grandmama has got a black cock on her cheek,  and one in her asshole, and one in each hand.  I have the Harlem Globetrotters.  I have the Harlem Globetrotters.  Curly Neal just shit my pussy.  And we're off.  Metal Lock Lemon ripped my cunt. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  At first, they send in the white incompetent team, and they all try to fuck me, but their  dicks are like spaghetti.  Then the Globetrotters come in, and he threw his cock at me, and it snapped right back into  his hand.  It was a trick cock.  I remember sitting in the audience when the negro came toward me with a big bucket and  threw it at me.  I thought it was confetti, but it was gum.  And I caught it all in my mouth, young Bill.  You six-foot-eight conservative loofus sponge big cocked little fella. 
[02:42:00]  That's right.  Grandma's got a pussy full of sickle cell.  What do you think of them apples?  You'll be talking about this someday on Fox News, won't you?  You're surprised they eat like us.  You ought to see how they fuck, young Bill.  They're making a nana hammock.  One in the mouth, one in the shitter, and nana swings when they meet in the middle somewhere  near the liver.  They fill up nana like a cannoli. 
[02:42:30]  Your grandfather dresses like Oscar did all the way up, and hasn't fucked nana in quite  a long time, Bill.  Cuck holes.  Hey, Florida Steve, I gotta read this.  Metal Ark Lemon just gave me a story of that.  What's that?  Metal Ark Lemon just gave me a shithead. 
[02:43:00]  A shithead.  A shithead, darling.  It looked like the one nana wears on Sunday, but there's no flower in it.  A shithead covering my eye socket.  I'll tell you that I'm afraid of blacks, but I'm only afraid that when they walk in, I'm  going to kneel and suck their cock so hard that their ears cave in.  That's right, young Bill.  Nana likes her black cock in her mouth. 
[02:43:30]  What do you think of them apples, you Republican?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why don't you...  Good point, Scott, from Chicago.  What about a little sweet Georgia Brown if we're going to do the Globetrotters?  Oh, yeah.  That'll bring the whole bit home, you know what I'm saying?  Poor Nana.  She loved it.  Oh, boy, she couldn't get enough.  Couldn't get enough.  You've come into town.  We've got two more clips to play.  God, there's three more parts.  At least.  Well, just keep them coming. 
[02:44:00]  My dear.  This is Radio Gold, my friend.  You want to hear the next clip?  Sure.  All right.  Well, self-explanatory.  You little whore.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  That's a good one.  Oh, my God.  Is that wonderful?  Wow, there are so many good sound clips in this. 
[02:44:30]  Who the fuck was saying this?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  This needs a whole bank.  One bank dedicated to this audio.  Let me hear that one again.  Oh, my God.  I've got to hear her say that again.  You little whore.  What the hell is going on?  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Who the hell is there?  Oh, nobody, you dumb bitch.  I couldn't wait anymore.  I'm climbing the damn walls.  Oh, I told you I had a banana up my cunt. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, God, it's good.  Jesus, it's just right.  I've got it all the way in.  I just wish I had another one up my ass.  Oh, you dirty bitch.  With you, anything goes.  I have to admit, when it comes to fucking, you're a genius.  I've always used carrots.  But this is smoother and thick all the way.  Jesus. 
[02:45:30]  But it's going to mash up in your pussy.  A carrot will stay hard.  Yeah, a carrot's got the right idea with the carrot.  Of course she does.  You don't have to dig out carrot after you're done.  That's right, when you're finished, your pussy smells like bunny breath.  It does.  It sounds like Samantha from Sex and the City.  Speaking of bananas.  Right, right.  I'm coming, you cunt.  You dumb horse-faced cunt. 
[02:46:00]  Hudson from Montana.  Curly dribbled all over her labia.  That's right.  Oh, I just wish I had one for my ass.  You horse-faced beard for a homosexual cunt.  Cha-cha-cha.  Stupid fucking show.  Are they making a movie out of it now?  Great.  Hold on, we got Gene from Waterford. 
[02:46:30]  Gene, what's up?  No, it's actually Jim.  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Jim.  Not much.  I was calling.  I got kind of a...  I heard you guys.  You know, stuff's going pretty good right now.  And I didn't really want to call in, but I had to.  I found out not too long ago that my grandmother actually did this stuff.  She did audio porn back in the day?  She did.  She did.  And it was very...  I found out from some papers and stuff I came upon and asked my mom about it.  And she wasn't too happy that I found out. 
[02:47:00]  But supposedly, you know, it's just the same way kind of...  My grandmother was on Broadway a lot.  And the same kind of way actors and actresses today, they go down on their luck out in California.  They go to porn, you know, visually.  She kind of did the same thing through audio.  Your grandma?  Yeah, she, you know, wouldn't be doing so well on Broadway and just drop into the studio,  make a couple of quick extra bucks and just sit there and smoke cigarettes all day and pretend 
[02:47:30]  that she's having orgasms and shit, so...  Jesus Christ.  That's great.  It's not too funny to find out about, you know, when you pitch your grandmother bacon cookies  and muffins for you, and then you think of her sitting around with a couple other old  slutty bitches and talking about how they're shoving bananas.  Talking about bananas.  Yeah, that's great.  Wow.  It's not too fun.  It's good.  I'm glad it's given you guys...  I mean, I don't know.  You guys might come across one of her tapes, so...  That'd be good for you to listen to.  Yeah, you came across the paper, and we might come across the tapes. 
[02:48:00]  I think Nana was better than you were given her credit for.  Yeah, if you guys find...  Take a movie.  She's in a bad old crow at that.  Nancy the Nibbler.  That was her name?  I think that's her stage name.  Nancy the what?  Nibbler.  Nibbler.  Nibbler.  All right.  Yeah, you don't want to get cocky.  Nibble that.  Nibble that.  She used to team up with Gail Guppy.  All right, Gene.  Thanks for your story.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  This is coming in like crazy.  Let me just do this real fast. 
[02:48:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana, cunt.  Ah, they talk about fucking the delivery boy from the grocery store.  Ah.  Danny, why are you...  Why is Danny sitting here?  What?  We need part two.  We can't wait.  You think I'm going to waste part two on today?  Yeah.  How many parts do you got, really?  From this alone, there could probably be another...  I mean, the dialogue's so awful.  I mean, seven parts at least.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  This is like having coke, and you're like, well, yeah, we could use a little more.  A little more.  I know it's for the whole weekend, but yeah, we'll do another part today.  Yeah?  We'll still have five parts left.  Well, this is only one of the 8-tracks.  I probably found there's like ten of them.  Oh, yeah, we could easily do another part then.  All right.  All right, let's hear a little more.  All right, here we go.  It was good, but damn it, I'm still hot for a stiff prick.  I know what you mean, pussy buddy. 
[02:49:30]  Nothing beats...  Hot for a stiff prick.  We should get one of the CBS lawyers.  It was good, but damn it, I'm still hot for a stiff prick.  Damn it.  I know what you mean, pussy buddy.  Nothing beats it.  While we're on the subject, why don't you try the delivery boy at the grocery store?  Is he any good?  Is he any good shit? 
[02:50:00]  He's got a cock on him like a horse.  He's circumcised, and when his head swells, it turns rose red.  Just thinking about it, it makes me put my finger up my cunt.  You mean your fucking hand, you bitch.  That cave you have could take an elephant.  Come on, get off your phone.  That's right.  How about some more animals, the horse and the elephant?  What the...  She's saying she has a large vagina.  I think that's what she's getting at.  My goodness.  Pussy buddies. 
[02:50:30]  If your cunt was any bigger, there'd be stalactite hanging in it.  Jeez, these are awful.  You mean your fucking hand, you bitch.  Shave that platypus.  Fucking animal.  It's all animal stuff.  Yes.  You hippo.  Hold on one second.  Bitch, that cave you have could take an elephant.  Now come on, get off the phone.  I'm going to order some more bananas from the grocery store. 
[02:51:00]  Bill, did you bring home those bananas for Nana?  You know what a three-pointer is?  Nana's a three-pointer.  I've got one in the mouth, pussy, and ass.  That's a three-pointer.  I'm a five-pointer if there's one for each hand, young Bill.  Be careful, I'll get black cum all over my charm bracelet.  Don't tell your grandfather.  I've got more black semen in my mouth than the African Navy.  Keep it down, Bill.  You'll talk about this on Fox someday.  That's right.  I'm doing a female rip-off voice of Anthony's 1940s guy. 
[02:51:30]  Whatever works.  I changed gender and I added cunt.  It's a different person.  Matt from St. Louis.  I like to make werewolf cunt movies.  I don't like the A train.  I like the N train.  Now you go play, Bill.  Nana's taping a...  Oh, I don't know.  Nana got nervous. 
[02:52:00]  Nana got nervous.  They wait outside my door like it's the unemployment line.  I tell them there's a little government cheese in my womb.  And they dive in headfirst.  Oh, don't bother Nana when she's getting a deep dicking, Bill.  Bill, your grandfather since the war hasn't been able to get it up.  You six-foot-nine, four-year-old with a big cock apparently, according to the transcripts. 
[02:52:30]  I wish I could do the voice.  Someone else has to read the great instant feedback coming in.  I can't do it justice.  Guys, I got a minor's joke that's pretty fucking funny, man.  You got Gino's there?  Let me see.  Just missed it.  Oh, just missed it?  All right.  That cave could take an elephant. 
[02:53:00]  It's like...  Cave.  I have a...  The dialogue is so bad.  A friend of mine who's a waiter, he's very gay.  Very gay.  Very.  How gay is he?  That's the whole answer.  He used to write straight porn.  And I meant to ask him when I saw him this week about it, because I would love to get him on to talk about it.  Because when you hear him talk, I think it'd be great to have him read some of the stuff he wrote.  He writes straight porn.  I don't know if he still does, but he used to.  He used to. 
[02:53:30]  And he's just such a small, fun...  Was it just...  Did he get it all wrong?  No, I never read it.  It must have been so funny, it's like he thought it was straight.  Yeah.  There you go, and then another guy comes in, and he's sucking his dick.  Yes.  So I was ready to fuck her, but then I noticed that her shoes didn't match her purse, and I had to leave.  Kicked her out.  Then her boyfriend came in.  I met this hot broad the other day.  She was walking a poodle in Chelsea.  Wait a minute.  Something wrong here.  All right, listen.  Why don't we take a break?  I have to tinkle. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, and Danny's working on...  We're going to waste another part of this today.  Anyway, he's saying we've got at least seven parts.  We'll do part two, hopefully, after the break.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  And we're going to find McAllister.  I want to hear wonderful...  Oh, yeah.  We've got the waka-waka-waka-doo.  All right, we'll do a little waka-doo when we get back, because Danny's going to need a little time.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's crazy.  This is what it's all about.  Oh, I love this.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  Wow.  He shows 36 double Ds.  He shows 36 double Ds.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double Ds.  He shows 36 double Ds.  Oh, wow.  He just will hurt now.  Will, will, will, will hurt now.  He just will hurt now.  Anywhere.  With a Mound Wednesday.  She'll flash.  She'll flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.  And there's boobs in his face.  I'm all for it. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, I love this.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out. 
[02:55:30]  This is fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it.  Wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Take your frog and take it off now.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  This us, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:56:30]  That's me.  Danny's working on part two of the 8-track porn from back in the day.  Yeah.  He found Radio Gold today.  He's good at finding Radio Gold, that Danny, I got to tell you.  Yeah, digs it up.  Hey, we wanted Lee to call about it, I don't know, hours ago, but we got him now.  Lee Abrams, everybody.  The great Lee Abrams from XM. 
[02:57:00]  How are you, Lee?  I'm fantastic.  How are you?  I'm good.  I read your blog last night, and it kind of inspired me to talk about it today a little bit.  Oh, that's cool.  That's cool.  You were trashing MTV.  You were trashing news in general.  I didn't know you were a big news guy.  I had no idea.  Yeah, you know, I just find it sort of world affairs interesting.  It's kind of just the whole media thing in me. 
[02:57:30]  But in the last, you know, 10 years or so, I've just become more aware of what's going  on and really focusing on how it's presented around here and generally find it pretty appalling  across the country.  It's just, it's so junked up.  It's just, it's horrible.  And that bothers you.  What's that?  Well, and that bothers you.  I mean, we're heading toward a junk culture in general.  You know, it's getting worse by the year.  And bothered that news in general is being pulled into this whole junk culture, right? 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, it's insane.  It's, what bothers me is the, I call it the blur.  It's like, you know, if you're pure junk, hey, that's great.  You know, but when these major news organizations treat Anna Nicole's, you know, baby as some  big serious news thing, what it does, I think, is just, it's just making our country so stupid.  It's, you know, I think the biggest threat we have is, you know, our own stupidity, and  it's just being fed by media.  And it all gets down, you know, I'm all for just, you know, junk stuff. 
[02:58:30]  It's junk food, you know, candy.  But, you know, when it gets blurred in with what's really important, at least in my opinion,  I think it just makes us dumber.  You know, that Miss South Carolina, Teen South Carolina video kind of says it all.  There's a generation of these kind of people being developed.  It's like, oh, man.  So, you know, again, I love, you know, the candy part, you know, what Britney's latest  escapade is. 
[02:59:00]  But, you know, I think there needs to be a separation between what's just, you know, stupid  stuff and kind of the real issues that are out there today.  What do you think of, like, Fox News Channel?  Actually, I love Fox News Channel.  I think, because you know where they're coming from.  You know what their point of view is all about.  And, you know, you know what you're going to get.  And they deliver it.  Whereas some other news channels, you know, kind of blurry.  You don't know really where they're coming from.  So I respect Fox just, you know, like you respect sort of the National Enquirer. 
[02:59:30]  At least you know what you're going to get.  And they...  Yeah, when you bought the Enquirer, yeah.  You knew it wasn't the newspaper.  And you were just going to get some entertainment out of it and the goofy stuff.  And on Fox, you know, you're going to get a certain point of view.  And they don't really, you know, that's what you get.  And they deliver it.  And what I call...  What they do, and some other news people do, which I like, is that when they report on a, you know, Britney or Paris story, there's a wink. 
[03:00:00]  You know, it's like, hey, we know this is stupid.  But, hey, here's what's going on.  Here's the latest.  But they know that people need to, you know, need to hear this stuff.  I guess it's, yeah, for ratings, whatever, you know.  Ratings.  But they wink at it.  Right, right.  That's, I think...  And it's like TMZ, you know, that's pure trash.  But it's so pure.  You know, if you really want to find out, you go there and you get it.  And they do as good of a job as anybody.  But it's like local TV news is, you know, it's unbelievable. 
[03:00:30]  It's so...  Well, the only word I can think of is just like plastic.  You know, these goofy, smiling news people, you know, the two news guys and the eccentric weather guy and the jock sports guy and, you know, the cute news co-anchor bantering back and forth about fires and lost dogs.  And it's just, I mean, it's terrible.  It's our favorite thing to do in the morning before the radio show.  We watch local news for an hour and we just laugh. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, every animal story has to have an animal sound effect.  Usually they use the rooster, even though they might be talking about an elephant that got loose in India or something, you know.  And we just laugh the whole time.  Like, this isn't news.  It's not real news.  But there are people out there that they just think it is what it is.  This is news.  And it's just not.  That's exactly it.  It's people look at this and say, oh, this is reality.  You know, it's not.  That's what scares me about, you know, the future of our country is just people buying into this stuff. 
[03:01:30]  And you'd think the broadcasters would know better.  I know it's a bunch of consultants and research and, you know, just sort of sheep kind of mentality and programming it.  But, you know, I was looking at TV air checks or whatever you call them, video checks, and TV news, local TV news hasn't evolved since the whole happy talk thing in the 70s.  And then I was looking at news in the 60s, news guests from Chicago where I grew up. 
[03:02:00]  And I just think it was just more credible than you had these old, crusty Irish guys, you know, telling the truth, and you believed them.  And, you know, they'd kick the hell out of you if you ran into them in a dark alley kind of thing.  And now you look at those stations, and it's just happy news, you know.  And the great thing is I just see tremendous opportunity if somebody decides to, and not get elite, but just smarten it up a little bit.  Because I think smart products are, you know, really the future. 
[03:02:30]  Look at Sopranos and Simpsons and, you know, a lot of products out there that are really smart in the way they're presented.  Well, you really think we can go back to, like, having someone like Walter Cronkite give us the news?  Oh, no.  No, but I think you can rethink it and have that same kind of integrity and just kind of swagger, but done 21st century style.  Yeah, I don't think you can go back there and say, hey, you know, you're 107 years old now. 
[03:03:00]  Go out of the air and do it or find that type of person.  But I think that, you know, again, that integrity, that level of quality, that attitude, that – I like the word swagger because it just had –  right now you look at TV news, local TV news, I just find it, again, you guys, it's hilarious.  It's not supposed to be funny.  It's more like an S on the Saturday Night Live bit than, you know, anything you take –  Well, Lee, I agree with you on a certain level.  Like, today's news is disgraceful.  And there was much more dignity to the news back in the day.  But, I mean, even in those days, they, unchallenged, did kind of toe the company line in a way about what the country wanted. 
[03:03:30]  And I'm not shitting on Cronkite.  They were obviously great newsmen.  But they really – what they said pretty much went, and people didn't realize they were being manipulated or led by the news back then, but they certainly were.  Oh, no, I agree with you.  It's – I think I'm really just referring – not really the content as much as presentation, but, yeah, it's – that's another thing is nobody believes these people anymore, particularly on the big stories. 
[03:04:00]  How great was Peter Finch in Network?  Oh, God, I love that movie.  I had it at its time.  I'll tell you, it's unbelievable.  But I'm actually very optimistic because, you know, the whole news business is driven by money and ratings and all that.  I really think there's money and ratings in doing it 21st century style, real, intelligent, really blowing up the playbook.  If you also watch all these TV newscasts, local TV, they're all the same.  They're all like, you know, in it for you. 
[03:04:30]  You know, that's believable.  And, you know, they all have the same kind of sets and the same look.  I think somebody just needs to blow it up, blow up the playbook and, you know, rethink how would you do.  Really great news and information that cuts through, that has swagger and integrity but isn't too cool for the room or too elite.  News of the future.  It's a comedy show.  Every morning we just laugh for the entire hour.  And what was interesting, we talked about this recently on our show, the 9-11 anniversary, you know, came and went at this point. 
[03:05:00]  And on 9-11, the local news went from this goofy comedy show to serious.  They're all dressed like conservatively and in dark clothes.  Somber music.  It's not black clothes.  And they went with somber music.  They have a somber version of their theme songs, which is amazing.  Like for when a president dies or something, they play this somber version of their theme music.  And then the next day they're back to showing the squirrel water skiing or what have you.  You know, like they didn't even do yesterday's newscast in dark clothes and somber music. 
[03:05:30]  That's another thing about news music.  Boy, is that locked in, you know, circa 1975.  That's one cool thing, you know, because on XM you can hear a Fox News channel.  And their music's actually pretty good.  And it doesn't sound like a typical, you know, sort of thing.  I've got to ask you as a pilot now, how long have you been flying?  Since I was 16. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Which is 1968.  Yeah, quite a few years.  What do you think happened with Steve Fawcett there?  I mean, there's a guy, very experienced.  What the hell do you think happened there?  You know, I don't, I can only imagine that it probably went up in some experimental airplane that, you know, broke up or had some significant mechanical problem in the middle of nowhere.  So that's, but I'm really watching it because I really have no idea. 
[03:06:30]  Do you think he's dead?  Oh, he's so dead at this point.  Now he's got to be, I mean.  Unless he found an Indian tribe to feed him.  Could have walked out of the day.  In the last month while he heals.  Raised by a pack of wolves, you know.  Yeah.  Steve Foster, just nude.  Being taken care of by wolves.  Hey, MTV.  You know, Lee, you consulted MTV back in the day, right?  Yeah, in the very early days.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:07:00]  And, you know, I think just, again, personal opinion, the thing on MTV is it's just, it doesn't stand for anything anymore.  Is it celebrity basketball or is it music?  I mean, they're called MTV.  And then, you know, just feeding the junk culture with all these video music awards and all this stuff that's so, I think, just cheesy.  Well, the award shows, that's a really interesting progression because when they first started doing those, they were making fun of all the other award shows. 
[03:07:30]  And that's what made it kind of cool.  And you didn't know what was going to happen.  It was live.  They let their presenters and stuff really mess around.  And you didn't know what you were going to see.  And now you fast forward 10 years or whatever it was, and now it's just like every award show, and there's no reason to tune in and watch it.  Yeah, kind of like a parody of themselves.  It's, again, like a Saturday Night Live type bit on MTV, but that's what they're really doing.  And, you know, the thing, again, that gets me is, you know, the power they have. 
[03:08:00]  They could really be doing something really cool that, you know, is engaging.  But what is that?  Well, I mean, again, we'd have to take that, we'd have to have some off-site discussion to talk about it.  I don't know what it is.  I just know what they're doing isn't it.  I mean, we could probably get some smart people together and figure that out.  All I know is what's coming out of there is just like really a shame just because, again, there's so much potential there. 
[03:08:30]  And it just seems, I know there's smart people working there, but it just seems all over the place.  It doesn't stand for anything.  MTV, you mean, right?  Yeah.  And one final thing.  This is all some of the stuff that Lee discussed on his blog.  I read his blog every week and it's blog.  It's really, really interesting.  The music thing where, how can I explain this, where even though it's like an older song or an older band, doesn't mean it can't be new? 
[03:09:00]  Does that make sense?  Yeah, I think you're right.  Like we're all obsessed with radio stations where it's like you've got to play the new music, the new music, the new music.  And there's so much music that has been made that is undiscovered.  Yeah, exactly.  What I find is most people, normal citizens, they don't necessarily, unless they're a musician, but just a normal, typical music fan, they don't differentiate.  Oh, I got it like that.  It's new.  You know, whereas there might be something that's, you know, years old that they've never heard before that to them it's new, even though by industry standards, no, it's not. 
[03:09:30]  That's an oldie.  And I even personally, I've just been kind of rediscovering guys like Howlin' Wolf, and they're amazing, and to me it's new and fresh.  And so I think there's a lot of that out there.  I haven't run into kind of young people who were born many years after Pink Floyd made their first records, who are discovering Pink Floyd. 
[03:10:00]  To them, that's like new and exciting.  Don't I notice that?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, I got it.  No, I was just going to say the music industry and radio, everything is based on what's getting played today, what's, you know, in the stores, what's in the trade papers.  But people have a more universal opinion of music.  It can be, you know, 50 years old, but if it touches them, hey, that's as relevant as something new.  Yeah, something's going on with Pink Floyd.  They never went away, obviously.  But in the last year, I've noticed a lot of the kids of, you know, today, like in their 20s and, you know, late teens, wearing Pink Floyd shirts. 
[03:10:30]  At the virus shows this summer, I saw so many Pink Floyd shirts.  Five years ago, didn't see as many.  But out of nowhere in the last year or so, I'm noticing this resurgence again with Pink Floyd.  It gets down to that, you know, again, smart, quality, integrity.  What they did, you know, it wasn't cheap.  It wasn't junky.  They never went out for that quick hit single.  They always maintained, you know, their standard and their sound and had complete blinders on as far as what's hip in the industry and all that. 
[03:11:00]  And that pays off.  That's like what we're talking about with news and music and everything.  It's that doing it smart.  And that doesn't, again, it doesn't mean elite or, you know, educated.  It just means, you know, smart.  And stuff like that lasts.  And Pink Floyd is such a great example of something that's just, you know, smart.  And they've never dumbed themselves down.  And it has long-term payoffs.  I think, you know, 20 years from now, people will be discovering Pink Floyd. 
[03:11:30]  And the funny thing is so many, like, rock stations that are scared to play Pink Floyd.  They don't even understand their audience is listening to Pink Floyd in between the White Stripes records and whatever.  You know, Wolf Mother, whatever you want to, you know, throw in that category.  It seems like the people programming...  The industry thing, they're an old classic rock band.  And we can't play them, you know, it's like, wait, every band has a different audience.  Lee, what is it with the...  Because you did all this stuff.  Like, the programmers, most of them are such fucking unoriginal hacks. 
[03:12:00]  Like, they have these playlists.  And they're terrified to deviate from their playlists because they hire these fucking faggoty research people.  And they just...  And they wonder why people are running away from their stations.  I know.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, it's great for XM.  But for listeners who don't have satellite radio, it's terrible.  But, yeah, their whole mentality.  I have...  I got some stories.  There's one guy in Texas just a couple years ago. 
[03:12:30]  So, the Beatles anthology came out.  And it was like full-page ads in USA Today.  ABC TV was doing a big thing on it.  It was like the talk.  And I said to the guy, you know, wow, Beatles anthology.  Beatles is important to you guys?  He said to the program director.  He said, oh, yeah.  They're our highest-testing band.  Oh, great.  So, you must be all over this new Beatles anthology.  Well, no, no.  You know, some of those versions are a little unusual, a little weird.  And they probably won't test very well.  So, we're not playing anything from it. 
[03:13:00]  You know, it's like, what?  Or, it's unbelievable.  Or, like, well, Pink Floyd's a great example.  You hear Money and a Brick in a Wall.  Meanwhile, they've done, you know, scores, hundreds of songs.  And we can't play that.  That doesn't test well.  It's just the whole system of radio research is completely flawed.  It makes no sense.  You know, you call people at dinnertime as a telephone solicitor,  and you ask them to rate records one to five.  I've actually seen this. 
[03:13:30]  Great record.  You know, everybody kind of agrees.  Here's a cool new song.  It goes into the music test thing.  People get called up again at dinnertime.  And rate this song one, I hate it, five, I love it, or never heard of it.  So, they play it.  And since it's brand new, people say, well, I've never heard of that one.  Goes on the research report.  And the program director looks at it and says, hmm, this record, unfamiliar.  We don't play unfamiliar records.  And that's the end of it.  So, this potentially good record gets, you know, tested and immediately is withdrawn because it doesn't make any sense. 
[03:14:00]  Well, let me take that thought a little further, too, because when I was first starting in radio, I was one of these kids.  I was in my, you know, early 20s.  And I was the guy calling random numbers and playing those sound clips for people.  Guess what?  Most people didn't want to take the survey.  So, guess what we did?  You made it up.  Of course, because I didn't want to lose my internship.  Of course I did.  Because after you call 20 people in a row and they're like, leave me the fuck alone. 
[03:14:30]  I'm eating dinner.  You're like, you know what?  I'll just fudge this shit.  You know, yeah.  The music programming always was kind of like a balance of science and emotion.  You know, it starts emotionally.  Then you use the research to see if you're full of it or not just to kind of give you a little backup.  And that worked great.  Now it's just all research.  Don't listen to music.  I've actually asked program directors, heard any good records this week?  They'll look at a spreadsheet and say, no, nothing good this week.  Meaning they never even listen.  They just look at what the data says. 
[03:15:00]  And if it's blind leading the blind, too, you know, it's, you look at the airplay-based charts and all the trade papers.  And if it's not going anywhere, well, you don't add it.  So it's just so disconnected from the streets, the whole process of picking music and songs.  And you go to these big classic rock concerts.  And you see people going nuts over songs at stations, oh, can't play because they don't test well.  What's wrong?  Hey, is Radiohead the new Floyd? 
[03:15:30]  Well, it's a different time and a different era.  I think, you know, no, I think there's only one Pink Floyd, but I think they're certainly...  Well, they're kind of a band, though, that doesn't care about singles in general.  I mean, they obviously want some popularity and want to make money, but, you know, they seem to be more into their art more than anything else.  No, I think they're great.  They have a huge future.  And, you know, I think sonically they have a lot in common with Pink Floyd.  You know, if there was a rock and roll stock market, that'd be, you know, a band you'd want to buy now. 
[03:16:00]  Because I think, you know, unless they, you know, just melt down internally, they can go hard.  And Oscar's helping me out in Jersey.  Lords of Dogtown, you know, that skate documentary, there was Floyd all through that, Pink Floyd.  That's probably why the young kids are back into it.  Because that was a huge documentary.  It's timeless.  It's very heady.  You know, and again, it's just quality laughs.  It's just like, you know, even Beatles songs, you listen to them now, they sound as relevant now as they did then. 
[03:16:30]  So, you know, that kind of quality laughs.  And again, the great thing about Pink Floyd compared to some other bands is they never compromise.  You know, they always just maintain their sound at a time when I'm sure their record company was saying, you know,  Hey, disco's big.  Kids are dancing.  Make a dance record.  You know, they're like.  Right, right.  They never went that way.  Yeah.  Hey, one last thing.  Like, we're in an unusual situation because we get to do the XM.  We get to do the regular radio.  And we yell and scream, but no one really listens to us.  We're trying to tell, like, regular radio, you know, this is the time to push all the way to the edge. 
[03:17:00]  They don't get that there's so much competition out there, and this is not the time to be uber conservative with your radio shows or with music.  Oh, I know.  Or even with your presentation as far as just playing, you know, nine minutes of commercials in a row.  Like, they've got to reinvent themselves.  This is the time to really realize that the people you're going for have so much competition. 
[03:17:30]  I mean, when Ann and I were huge in afternoon drive, we were just discussing this the other day.  No one had cell phones, really.  And if they did, the best they could do is maybe text here and there.  That was it.  Now you could download music.  You could web surf.  You could do all sorts of shit.  You got the iPods.  That wasn't around when we were huge in afternoons.  You got the satellite radio.  That wasn't around.  And what does regular radio do?  They just ignore that all this stuff is going on around them, and they're just sitting there just waiting to die.  Because, Lee, you think it's big. 
[03:18:00]  You're saying?  Well, you're saying it's so true.  But it also, that's a problem with, like, TV news.  You know, 20 years ago you had three local stations and maybe an independent, and, you know, that was news.  And now, God, there's, you know, 50 million different Internet sites, and it's unbelievable.  And here they are living in this happy news world.  But same thing with radio.  Yeah.  In 1975, when there was just AM and FM to worry about, yeah, it was different.  Now, my God, you're getting in this little, you know, old-school shell and doing boring radio where you're as relevant as the phone company or the, you know, electric company. 
[03:18:30]  You know what it is? It's the immediacy of grabbing something better if something is not entertaining you.  Like, immediately, if you don't like something, you can pick up your iPod.  You have a fucking hundred other options.  And it seems like the guys in Terrestrial, and probably the same guys in TV, are older guys, and they want to just get out quietly because they put their time in.  They have no vested interest in what's going to happen five or eight years from now because they already got just fucking huge parachutes of money. 
[03:19:00]  They don't give a shit.  And it seems like there's no visionaries or nobody creative on that side of it.  And it's embarrassing when you see the fucking same promotions, the same dogshit commercials, the same crap that I hated when I was 20, and now I'm 39, and it sucks as badly now as it did then, but I have other options.  Right, and a lot of it is a lack of balance between business and creative people at the tops of these companies. 
[03:19:30]  It tends to be a lot of, you know, a lot of pure business guys.  There's no, like, creative people that balance it and keep them in check.  And also what I noticed, and I call it the creative batting average, where people come up with 100 ideas, and if you come up with 100 and 30 of them are good, you know, you're an all-star.  You're batting 300.  Nobody remembers the 70 that didn't work.  Nobody's taking any creative at best.  Nobody's stepping up to the plate and, you know, swinging for the fence.  It's, I've noticed that a terrestrial radio, it's, people used to come up with ideas, and again, if 30% of their ideas were good, you know, they were an all-star. 
[03:20:00]  Now, everybody's afraid to go up to the plate and try anything new, you know, it might, you know, it might work.  But, you know, you raise a great point about the business.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  You raise a great point about the business and the creative, and it seems like they never, never fucking side with the creative.  It's always, and I understand business has to come first, I get it, but whenever there's a conflict between the two, they will never side with the creative. 
[03:20:30]  I mean, it's almost 100 to 0 in the way they'll side with the business side of it.  No, that's, yeah, I know.  It's challenging for the creative side these days.  But the key is, you know, again, that balance, because I've just seen companies that were all creative, and they'd go out of business in six months,  and then you see the companies that are all business, and they're very boring and vulnerable.  So that balance is just critical.  All right.  Hey, Lee, I'd like to, you know, throw your blogs up on the side every once in a while, if it's all right. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, throw them every week. Send them to everybody you know.  For the intellects that listen to our show.  A lot of it's dumb stuff, but, you know.  Nah, it's pretty interesting stuff.  No, it's interesting. Lee Abrams, a huge, and I mean huge, yes fan.  Yeah, there's a band that, uh...  Oh, that was beautiful.  Oh, he was gear up. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, he was.  Oh, there's a band. He's still talking right now?  Oh, that's it.  Oh, he's still talking.  When you said yes, he probably lit a joint like, this is going to be good.  And, oh, trying to bring out the lava lamp, I'm going to have a discussion.  Where's my blacklight poster?  Lee loves yes.  Really?  And someday, we'll have to get into that discussion, because I, uh, you know, here and there, I enjoy a yes song. 
[03:22:00]  But, I think, I think that could be his favorite band of all time.  Yes is the only, uh, band that, I remember getting their album years ago, and it didn't have that groove in it where the song ends.  Right.  Like, an entire side was one song.  Yeah.  What the hell is that about?  They had a few of those.  Hey, uh, Lustful Sex Life Part 2.  Oh, goody.  We promised this.  Should we save it for tomorrow, or do you want to do it now?  Uh, I'd like to hear a little of it. 
[03:22:30]  I, I have to, uh, you know what, I'm going to have to side with, uh, AC.  Yeah.  What?  I want to hear a little of it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, all right.  Let's do it, then.  We're waiting for Danny to, to come up with it.  You got it.  He's got Part 2, and there's at least, are, are we still saving, uh, saying there's seven parts, uh, to this 8-track porn?  To this, just this one, at least.  I mean, where this one ends, he's not even done with her yet.  Let's just put it that way.  Really?  Mm.  It's too, I mean, it's, I, you could probably just play the remainder of this as one giant 20-minute track and have just as much fun with it. 
[03:23:00]  All right, here we go.  Uh, Grocery Boy comes over for some fucking.  We're back to the 8-track porn, everyone.  Grocery Boy comes over for some fucking.  Yes.  This is an 8-track sandwich.  8-track tape.  It's audio porno.  Yeah.  People were supposed to pop this in, listen to it, and jerk off, I guess.  Yeah.  Theater of the mind for your cock.  Oh, there's the doorbell.  Uh-oh.  Eager Grocery Boy.  No kidding.  Two quick rings. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, why don't you wait?  Mrs. Owens?  Yes?  I've got your groceries.  I hope everything's here that you ordered.  So do I, honey.  So do I.  Um, where do you want it?  For now, the kitchen table will do.  You must be tired from all those deliveries.  Would you like a drink before you go?  Oh, I sure would.  I'd go on my lunch break now.  Oh, what do you usually eat for lunch?  Just what I'm looking at.  And what do you mean by that remark?  Oh.  An old bitch. 
[03:24:00]  I eat old bitch.  In the classic sense.  I cook them on a spigot and I eat them.  I eat their leathery feet with a nice guillotine.  Just what I'm looking at.  I love the crinkle of the bag through half of the conversation.  And how come the delivery boy is 40 years old?  He's awful.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's fucking Sam the Butcher who showed up.  What's sex crime is he hiding from?  He's half retarded with a monster cock. 
[03:24:30]  He's had hair on it.  He's had like curly piglet tail hairs on it since he was four.  Old retard dick.  Nice doily hairdo, stupid.  And we're taking off again.  We were in the...  The plane was in the hangar for a while just enjoying a little conversation and a little food  as we fuel up the plane while the plane has taken off again.  Just what I'm looking at.  And what do you mean by that remark? 
[03:25:00]  They told me at the store that Carol Peters recommended me.  Baby, she eats all ten inches of my prick.  Hey, you.  Ah, stop the bullshit, slut.  You don't have a damn thing on under that, Minnie Nighty.  You want a good fucking so bad you can taste it.  So stop screwing around and get the damn thing off.  Wow.  And then all of a sudden...  Wait a minute.  This isn't 20 Elm Street?  No, honey.  This is 18 Elm Street.  Well, it looks like I've made a mistake.  The slut I'm looking for is next door. 
[03:25:30]  I apologize.  By the sound of this guy's acting, it sounds like he doesn't really like pussy, if you  know what I mean.  He's awful.  He's acting big.  He's got a ten inch cock.  Of course he does.  A ten inch prick.  Prick.  A ten inch prick.  I've always hated the word prick.  That was...  Terrible.  It's an oldie time word for a cock.  Now it's pretty much used as, you know, that guy's a fucking prick.  Right.  But don't be such a fucking prick.  Come here, sit on my prick.  You don't say, hey, so she's sucking my prick.  It's terrible.  Oof. 
[03:26:00]  A mini nightie.  Yeah, I see you ain't got nothing on under that mini nightie.  Carol...  What the hell is that?  Carol Peters recommended me.  What?  What?  Well, the guy gets...  Gladys Moorhead.  What?  I fucked Ethel Bombach so hard that her asshole pink sucked.  That's right.  Helen put two fingers in my ass and left a press-on nail in my colon.  I had to go to the hospital, honey.  You know how it is. 
[03:26:30]  Mildred Blumberg's teeth fell out when she fucking sucked my prick.  I gave a good deep-dicking to Vivian Tripoli.  Where's the E-Rock?  This is the time we need him.  Jesus Christ.  Where is he?  He's...  That's great.  Where's the sound guy?  I don't know.  This is where we need sounds for the show.  He's very busy.  Doing what?  I don't know.  Besides not exercising or fixing mumps neck, which he has. 
[03:27:00]  That stupid fat...  I bet you right now he's doing a headstand to see if the fat will kind of sink.  He wants to see if he still has a jawline.  His head has a foreskin.  Oh, fuck.  Pulled down around his neck.  He's brickhead.  That's why you kiss his cheek sometimes.  It smells like cheese.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Where were you?  What are you doing?  We need you.  What did you do?  You're doing personal business, right?  Yes.  What?  What is that? 
[03:27:30]  Why did you leave the studio?  I was given something that I had no idea what it was.  I thought it was important.  It turned out to be nothing.  What were you given?  An envelope with your photos saying this had to be taken care of.  I opened up your photos in here.  So I was asking...  Who gave it to you?  One of the interns.  When did he give it to you?  Just right now.  He gave it to you on the air?  I wish I could just leave the show and just like wander around for 10, 15 minutes.  Talk to the interns.  The intern walked in while you were on the air?  This is like you do at a regular job, but unfortunately we can't do that.  Yeah.  Like you just wander off and someone goes, hey, where were you? 
[03:28:00]  Oh, well, the boss had to talk to me about something.  About what?  Counselor, I'm talking to you.  Oh, sorry.  I had to leave, judge.  I was...  Dude, how great would it be to just get up and wander around?  Just leave.  Come back 10, 15 minutes later.  I never realized...  Hope no one notices.  I never realized that.  Like whenever I was in the food industry, whenever I worked there, there's certain times you can't  leave.  Like it's the orders are coming in too fast and shit like that.  And I always hated that kind of pressure, but I never realized I can't just leave in  this job.  Let me see that.  Every other job I had, I could walk away from whatever the job was for a few minutes. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  An intern walked in and hands you what we have here is these two old Opie and Anthony photos  with the awful manila envelope.  And you looked at this and you raced outside.  Why?  Why?  I had no idea what it was for.  He comes in with it and says...  Here's what it's for.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Two fucking Opie and Anthony photos taken care of.  By the way, and Jimmy blew up my spot, but you could tell that it wasn't important because 
[03:29:00]  the envelope has a lot of holes in it and you can see that it's just a couple pictures  of us.  It's an inter-office memo envelope.  They're reusable.  It's the two black and white photos with ONA and my stupid head.  Any person would say, oh, obviously they need these signed.  Oh, Captain Tripp's neck ran out of here.  That's the...  You few readers.  That's right.  Hey, thigh throat.  Why would you take off? 
[03:29:30]  God damn that, E-Rock.  I needed a good deep fucking and he wouldn't show up.  He walked in with a manila envelope.  I said, what do you usually eat on your lunch break?  He said anything.  E-Rock, you may have misunderstood.  He could have said everything.  That's right.  I hope you...  I hope E-Rock realizes you make it so easy.  Oh, shit.  I said, come on, E-Rock. 
[03:30:00]  Fuck me hard.  So he said, all right, and started to work for me.  E-Rock, you kind of have a very important position on the show.  You can't really leave that area too much.  Speaking of positions.  That's right.  Speaking of positions.  He bent me over and used my back as a table to eat potato chips and mayonnaise sandwiches off of.  He didn't even put that little prick near me.  Boy, that carol sure was wrong.  This E-Rock likes cake, not pussy.  Yeah, the grocery delivery guy comes over and just delivers groceries. 
[03:30:30]  That's right.  He not only didn't fuck me, but he ate half of the groceries.  He left all of the milk and nonfat yogurt untouched.  But there were two chips left in the bag.  His whole job is to jazz up shit.  And trust me, you could have really helped us out with the Lee Abrams interview with jazzing it up with shit.  Ah, a little music.  A little music or something.  That Pink Floyd would have been good.  Yeah, he'll do a little us and them as he's talking about Floyd. 
[03:31:00]  So what do you mean by, what do you mean by that?  Well, I...  I go to usually lunch now.  All right, let's get back to the...  Can we get back to the deep dicking?  Because this guy gets very aggressive in this.  I love this guy.  Called her a slut.  He knows you.  Yes.  Well, he gets really aggressive too.  He's got a 10-inch prick.  He sure does.  I'll carol things.  You like what you see, lover?  Oh, cunt.  With a body like yours, you should be in a high-class whorehouse.  Now stop the bullshit and come over here. 
[03:31:30]  Now, get down on your knees.  Oh, feel me up a little, Jimmy.  Uh-huh.  Not on your light.  Waiting will make your pussy hotter.  Now, unzip my fly and take my cock out.  This is like Angry Town.  They live in Angry Town.  Yeah, this guy...  Everyone's mad.  They're all getting laid and stuff, but they're all pissed off at each other.  Fuck you, cunt.  Right.  I'm gonna fuck you.  Hey, how about, sweetheart?  How about hey, baby?  How about you fill me up first?  That'll be the day. 
[03:32:00]  I'm not squeezing those saggy sweat socks full of sand.  How about you fill me up, Jimmy?  Nothing doing.  Get on your knees.  It'll make you pussy hotter.  When you're stuck to the linoleum, then I'll pick you up and give you a good spin fuck.  They're just awfully unsexy people.  And they're just angry.  Fuck you, cunt in your ass, and then I'm gonna scram.  Well, get to it, then.  Yeah.  Everyone's pissed.  Eat my ass while I watch Cavalcade.  Obviously, there was a war going on, and everyone was a little uptight. 
[03:32:30]  Weren't sure if we were gonna win the big one at this point.  Yeah.  Unzip my fly and take my cock out.  Oh, honey.  She was right.  It's beautiful.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Put on Ronan Martin's laughing.  While I watch it, you can suck my cock.  My prick.  Suck my prick like Charles Nelson Reilly.  The ghost in Mrs. Muir is on. 
[03:33:00]  That's right.  Suck that prick like you're the father on a show, and we have no idea what you really like yet.  We won't know until the late 80s or early 90s.  Or early 90s.  That's right.  When a stiff wind blows you 20 feet, and you have to explain yourself.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Kiss the head now.  Yeah.  Start licking it all.  It's like E-Rock drinking. 
[03:33:30]  Nice and easy.  Just lick the head.  It's so damned hard.  Christ, it's big.  I don't know if I can take it all.  Won't be able to take it all.  You got it wrong.  You're not gonna give me a blowjob.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  This guy means business.  Sure does.  I want you to get on your knees and sound like a sleaze deck while you suck a dick.  That's right.  Your pussy looks like Chaka's back. 
[03:34:00]  Once again, I gotta point out, I thought the mouth fucking was a new invention.  I'm kind of depressed today.  Yeah, I'm gonna fuck your mouth.  I thought that it was all romantic back then.  That's right.  I've been mouth fucking for years.  I liked doing some of that mouth fucking back then.  Nana liked her mouth.  I bet you, you know, none of us want to look at our grandmothers like that, but at least  one person in this room, one of our grandmothers, liked to have her head hanging off the bed  with grandpa's cock throat fucking.  Oh, wow.  Squeezed her awful tits.  And his balls are like hitting her nose.  No, yeah, like the bridge and their old man balls. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And she just loves it.  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test.  This is a coordinated monthly test for XM Satellite Radio, equipment that can use 
[03:35:00]  and quickly warn you during emergencies as being tested.  If this had been an actual national emergency, official messages would have followed the  alert tone.  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system. 
[03:35:30]  Don't trip.  Suck.  What a douche.  Over the head.  I dig it.  Yeah, yeah.  Now take more of it and start sucking.  Oh.  Suck hard.  Yeah.  Deeper.  Deeper, cunt.  Yeah, this is a buffo, sucko blowjob.  Jimmy, play with my tits.  That's right.  I liked it.  That's right.  I want you to suck it and sound like Voss trying to say church. 
[03:36:00]  All right, hold the fuck up.  Well, this is swell.  Hold the fuck up.  What's the matter?  XM is doing a test of the emergency broadcast system in the middle of grandma's being throat  fucked.  How far back do we have to go?  What?  Oh my God.  How long is a fucking emergency broadcast test on?  Why would nobody tell us?  Test it at like midnight.  Test it during the Lee Abrams interview.  Right.  The fuck is wrong with everybody? 
[03:36:30]  They couldn't hold that shit off?  Who's responsible for that?  At least test it during the best of.  Whose job is it to fucking tell us that?  Someone has to tell us.  We can't do shit that just won't air.  It's fucking ridiculous.  That is stupid.  Well, we'll start.  Test it in the middle of a bit.  Well, are we back yet?  Second fucking time this month.  This is a new thing. 
[03:37:00]  We're back.  I know we're on, but is the emergency test over?  It's done.  How long did it last for?  Do we know?  I'm finding out.  And do they know?  Whose job is that?  Whose job is that?  Some guy that doesn't pay attention to the content of the show and just goes, ah, trying  to push the button.  Yeah, I want to know whose fucking job it is.  How about someone that pays attention a little bit?  There are times during this show, we do five fucking hours a day, there's plenty of opportunities  to do an emergency broadcast test.  No one's going to give a shit.  Tell us.  We'll take a break.  Yeah, do it over the fucking... 
[03:37:30]  Tell us about the discount, Harry!  Yeah, how about that?  Do it over that shit.  Whose job is it to tell us...  Yeah, whose job is it?  ...about that stuff.  Somebody in D.C. or somebody.  Hey, God, just hire people with a brain.  That's all I ask.  Yeah, we're like...  That's all I ask.  We're doing a show here and all the people who are hearing it.  Or just save money and hire robots, because that's what you got.  Oh, that'd be futuristic.  Because I can't imagine it's something that just happens, like, oh, you know, 1046, it 
[03:38:00]  just happens automatically.  I really think it's someone that has to actually set that in motion.  All right, where were we?  All right, we'll start the clip over, because I don't know what you guys missed.  Oh, fucking God, is that irritating?  I'm going to cram it so far down your throat, you'll think it's coming out of your ass.  Now start sucking, bitch.  Oh, Jesus, it's hard. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, it's so big.  I told you to stop talking so much.  Stop talking so much.  I can't hear that emergency broadcast system.  That's right, bitch.  I want you to suck so much, XM will hire you.  What the fuck does that mean?  And when that happens, during the replay, what do they hear?  That's what I'm finding out.  I'm going to come right and boop.  Oh, no, because you guys are going to...  They said most of the stuff you couldn't hear.  I got pissed badly. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, most of the stuff you couldn't hear, what?  For that 30 seconds, you couldn't hear all the great lines.  There was some good, great little...  Yeah, some of the best radio we've ever done, I'd say.  That shouldn't affect the replay, though.  Really?  It doesn't play in the replay?  Nah, it's different.  I hope so.  I hope so.  Put your mouth over the head.  I dig it.  Yeah, yeah, now take more of it and start sucking.  Now, that's it.  Suck hard and deep.  Deeper.  Deeper, cunt. 
[03:39:30]  Deeper, cunt.  Oh, please, Jimmy, play with my tits.  Oh, damn, that's good.  You little whore.  The way your ass is twisting, I think you're coming just thinking about it.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, baby, yeah.  Now, use your teeth up and down.  Just your teeth.  Teeth?  Teeth, what?  What the fuck was going on back then?  What the hell is that about?  Get a cheese grater on the head of my cock and just start cheese grating it. 
[03:40:00]  Could you do that, honey?  Yeah, I like that.  And, Jimmy, you're the star of this.  I know I am.  That's good.  Yeah, just a little teeth.  A little teeth?  That's great, a little teeth.  Could you put my balls in a vice and squeeze it like Pesci did that guy's head in Casino?  I want my balls to pop out the head of my cock.  I'm getting close, honey.  Get that lighter.  I'm going to open my asshole.  I want you to just burn the hole.  I want you to twinge at a nice brown, like a briquette, a charcoal briquette, while I  cum all over this electrical outlet. 
[03:40:30]  That's it.  Teeth.  Scrape your teeth against my cock.  Yeah, that always feels good.  Give me a good raking.  This guy obviously knows nothing about a good blowjob.  Jesus, you certainly don't want the teeth.  I mean, receiving one, Than.  Don't make me come over there and suck your prick.  Oh, shit.  That's good.  Suck harder.  I'm going to ram it down your fucking throat harder. 
[03:41:00]  Damn it, harder.  Oh, please squeeze my tits.  They're on fire.  Oh, Jimmy.  Let go of my ears.  Fuck you, cunt.  I'm going to cum down your throat.  Oh, my God.  He's got him by the ears.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, now we got an assault.  Fuck you, cunt.  Let go of my ears.  Fuck you, cunt.  I told you to wash behind these before supper.  How about they do another take, by the way?  Fucked up, cunt.  How do you fuck that up?  Listen.  Jimmy, let go of my ears. 
[03:41:30]  Fuck you, cunt.  I'm going to cum down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll rip your ass so hard you won't sit down for a week.  It is so non-sexy.  It's horrendous.  And you'll bet your...  And what do you say?  You darn well better...  You darn tootin'.  You better swallow it.  You darn tootin'.  I'm going to fill your shitter with seed.  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.  Well, uh... 
[03:42:00]  Oh, this guy rules.  She makes a lot of weird noises as he's coming here.  Oh, he blows his load?  Yeah, and, you know, so she has to ham it up for the...  Of course.  ...the audio-only porno, so...  Yeah, well, it is 8-track porn.  Porno for the blind.  Get ready, you bitch.  I'm going to cum.  Oh, man.  Christ, I'm cumming.  It was good. 
[03:42:30]  Swallow, dammit.  It was great.  Everyone's thinking the same thing.  Stop whining.  What the hell was that?  I'm a whore, you idiot.  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm Brian Murphy. 
[03:43:00]  Suck my prick.  Wait, wait.  We can have fun with this.  Hold on.  Now we're having fun.  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, wait, wait.  This one.  You do Arnold.  I got this.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Stop.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Who is your daddy? 
[03:43:30]  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  I've got news for you.  You are mine now.  You son of a bitch.  This is wonderful.  It's amazing.  Danny, where have you found this?  This is just great.  He's got seven parts.  That's a second part.  It's too easy.  I just love how angry they are.  It's too easy.  It's just horrendous dialogue.  All right.  More of the Arnold Cummings sounds. 
[03:44:00]  That was good.  Swallowed down it.  That was good.  Oh, you're fucking right.  It was great.  That was quite a load you shot.  Shit, I thought I was going to drown.  I can't wait to feel that big prick of yours in my juicy pussy.  That feels good.  Now, start working on me with your tongue. 
[03:44:30]  Start on my balls and work your way on down to my asshole.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I'm going to give you AIDS.  What?  I just gave you AIDS.  Suck it, you bitch.  Suck it.  I'm going to grab you by the ears.  Enough.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible. 
[03:45:00]  Yes.  How did your parents come?  Yes.  You're going to take all of...  Nothing but caught me.  Nothing but caught me.  Yes.  Fuck you, you cave.  I'm going to fuck your mouth.  Now, choke yourself.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said, choke yourself. 
[03:45:30]  Do you suck this?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Final clip for today.  He instructs her to lick him all over and closes with his sweaty balls.  Right?  Oh, when the hell are you going to fuck me?  Don't be so damned impatient.  Carol's right.  You're built like a brick shithouse.  Baby, when you're through working on me, I'm going to suck that sweet little cunt of yours dry. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, you suck me.  That's good.  Fuck me.  Work your way down to my stomach.  Oh, yeah.  Now, massage my dick with your fingers.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Now, between my legs and around my balls.  What are you doing?  Turning on my stomach, you dumb bitch.  Now, work your way down from my shoulders.  Anything you say, you cuckersucker. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, that's it, baby.  Yeah.  Now down my back.  Oh, no.  That's good, baby.  You've got a hell of a touch with your tongue.  Where's he headed?  Yeah, you're a natural-born fuck machine.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, honey.  Oh, that's great.  Now, lick my sweaty balls. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, shit.  That's great.  That's right.  I thought he was guiding her to the asshole first.  No.  Stick that tongue up my asshole.  Come on, do it, you cunt.  Lick my sweaty balls.  I want your breath to smell like an onion.  He's sweaty balls.  Fuck is a natural-born fuck machine.  Lick that armpit between my legs, sweetie.  Fucking dumb cunt.  Now sink your teeth into my balls like an apple.  I want you to twist my scrotum until I yelp like a pig with it. 
[03:47:30]  Like a fucking doorknob.  Some fucking guy.  Bob in Manorville.  85 miles an hour on the Ocean Parkway jerking the pickle to 70s audio porn.  I'm such a loser.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  You can work that tongue.  We got at least five more to go.  Five more parts.  Are they all so angry? 
[03:48:00]  Why so angry?  I don't know.  This one seemed to have like a theme going.  Come on.  But, I mean, it's nonstop.  Like, that's how it is.  But why, Danny?  Why are they so angry, you cunt?  Because.  Yeah.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  There's another half hour where that came from.  Oh, yeah, I bet.  Come on, Danny, with your big prick.  Tell him what he wants to know.  Speaking of half hour, when are you going to come?  It's like angry Vince porno.  Yeah. 
[03:48:30]  Come on.  Suck my prick.  Suck it.  You want to suck my prick, don't you?  Come on.  Lick my sweaty balls.  Lick my sweaty balls.  That's right.  You're a regular fucking machine.  Yeah.  Come on, work your way down.  You're not going to suck my cock.  I'm going to fuck your mouth.  That's what I'm going to do.  Fuck your mouth.  You're built like a brick shithouse.  Brick shithouse. 
[03:49:00]  Now the brick shithouse.  Come on.  I'm going to fuck you like a dog.  Get down on your knees like a dog.  That's right.  I'm going to pop an eye out and skull fuck you.  That's it.  Pop your eye out.  I'm going to snap your neck.  Angry Vince fucking.  Lick my ass.  You stick your tongue up my ass.

I could listen to that all day.  All day long.  You're going to suck my prick till I come down your throat.  I'm going to come.  Here I come.  I'm coming. 
[03:50:00]  All right.  It's coming.  That's right.  Don't spit it out.  Spit that come out and you're fired.  You're fired.  Fucking angry Vince.  He's got to be part of this.  I've never seen such angry people.  Here comes that Vince McMahon again.  He likes fucking in the ass and yelling at people.

There's another one where I'd listen to where it was like some chick goes to her psychologist.  And the psychologist.  Give us our choices for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Give us our choices for tomorrow. 
[03:51:30]  Give me two seconds.  I'll give you a list.  I'm going to try to think of how that plays out.  All right.  We get to choose which one we want to hear next.  Hi, doctor.  Yeah.  How you doing, cunt?  Sit on the couch.  Like a psychiatrist is going to be like that.  You know why you're here?  Because you're a cunt.  Now get on the couch.  I'm going to fuck you into a state of mental health.  She'll start talking about her problem, how she can't get enough prick.  Yeah.  Nice big prick.  And he'll go, like this one?  Yeah.  I'm going to prescribe my prick.  You know, back then, they probably didn't know much about that. 
[03:52:00]  They didn't have like pills, did they?  Hopefully it's a real fucking mental illness though, and a girl's retarded.  She has the Pete Rose do.  Hey, that man.  I don't know what to do.  I like a prick.  Suck this, dumb fella.  I'm going to fuck you until you can spell.  We're on a roll, and people want more clips.  We just can't do it now because it's got to go through the whole fucking thing.  You get them tomorrow. 
[03:52:30]  It takes a good 20 minutes or so to get one of these parts together.  We'll have a couple more tomorrow, though.  Maybe.  If you're a good, responsive crowd.  Hey, line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Danny's coming in here with our choices for what we want to hear tomorrow.  Offering you all the tools you need to win this season in fantasy football.  Trash talk with confidence.  Take home the glory.  BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  It's not really fair to do line of the day today.  The riff you guys were doing there for the last hour is like a chock full of lines. 
[03:53:00]  Someone just writes, ha, ha, ha, dumb bella.  That's very funny.  I'm going to fuck that Columbia president hairdo right off you.  Someone else writes, how important is the prick?  Linger Lunger.  All right.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  I said, what do you usually eat on your lunch break?  He said anything. 
[03:53:30]  The E-Rock.  All right.  Our choices are coming in.  Danny, everyone.  Oh.  Danny, are you taking full credit for this?  No, I am absolutely not.  Smell that, bitch.  Smell that gassy burp out of my asshole.  Oh, that fart was wonderful.  It smells like you prick.  It smells like shit.  Who gets credit for this?  Actually, a listener sent me a link to a guy's blog who had posted some of these on his blog.  Wow.  The listener helped out the show all the time.  Oh, is it that?  No, it's not. 
[03:54:00]  Don't usher it over here.  All right, let's go.  What are our choices?  You presented your fart to me.  Well, choices for tomorrow.  We can either finish the current one or we can go with...  We can definitely finish the current one.  Just get that out of the way, and then we'll move on to another one.  Then the next ones will be a choice from Fornicating Female Freaks.  Apartment 69.  Ah, what a coincidence.  Sex Love Story.  Dr.  Dr.  Dr. Kaufman examines Crystal.  Dr. Kaufman sounds very good. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Come here, you Jew.  Or she'll just be all angry.  Yeah, nothing I like than a little kike cock or a suck and screw orgy.  Ah, Dr. Kaufman.  I want Dr. Kaufman.  And the leading Dr. Kaufman.  The link was sent in by Jeff in Virginia.  Jeff, you rock, Jeff.  Radio gold today because of you, my friend.  Hurry up.  I have to come before sundown.  I did hear a few of those.  A few clips from Dr. Kaufman examines Crystal, and the guy's putting on his best Sigmund Freud style. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, is he doing this kind of, let me examine you.  I think you are having a problem dealing with your psyche from your childhood?  Shut up, Doc, and fuck my cunt.  Okay, and then he just turns into like a fucking, he stopped being a therapist, and he starts fucking.  Please find out as much info on the actors in this as you can.  And there has to be a way to find who made these.  Yeah, there's got to be production company and stuff. 
[03:55:30]  There has to be, dude.  It might be tough.  Oh, yeah, we'll try.  These are probably from the mid-70s.  Some of these people might be alive.  I mean, this would be.  What a get.  This would be better than finding Fawcett.  Yes.  Yeah, I want to say to Matt, man, you're welcome.  He says, thank you for bonus time.  Well, you're welcome, Matt, man.  Yeah, we were going to leave early and everything.  Yeah, because we still don't really have anyone paying attention.  No.  And then someone just writes, big point made a gumsy.  Sea creature, Cleveland.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I have the Harlem Globetrotters. 
[03:56:00]  Curly Neal just shit my pussy.  Shit.  Is that horrible?  Another runner-up.  Let that one sink in for another few seconds.  Jesus.  Oh, I'm going to be hearing that one today.  Oh, fuck.  Curly Neal. 
[03:56:30]  Why would he shit her pussy?  I don't know.  He was bald and angry.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Her white cunt was annoying him.  He just fucking, while Meadowlark was fucking her throat, Curly turned his back to her and  Meadowlark's thinking, not again.  And he fucking.  He's done it before.  Of course.  It's all he does.  He's impotent.  He can't get hard on, but he puts his silo shit inside the pussy.  And there's so much shit the pussy falls sideways like that shit hat. 
[03:57:00]  Well, he'll fucking leave the fucking silo log, half in his ass and half in her pussy,  and then he'll sit fuck her.  And then he'll sit fuck her.  He'll sit fuck her until it just becomes a crammed up piece of melted chocolate.  Oh, fuck.  Sit fuck her.  I can't even accept that.  Oh, my fucking sides hurt. 
[03:57:30]  Sit fucking.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I bet you right now he's doing a headstand to see if the fat will kind of stink.  He wants to see if he still has a jawline.  His head has a foreskin.  Pulled down around his neck.  What an awful image that conscious of. 
[03:58:00]  It's just curly.  He's really antisocial.  Sit fuck.  I don't think it's fair today, but here is your long day.  I said, come on, Iraq, fuck me hard. 
[03:58:30]  So he said, all right, and started to work for me.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Dude, we need I'm coming, you dumb bitch.
