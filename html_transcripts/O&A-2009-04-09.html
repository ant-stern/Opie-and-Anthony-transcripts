<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment centered around a listener, “Dr. Steve” from Bayshore, who sent the hosts a bottle of homemade wine.  Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, and E-Rock reacted with extreme disgust, describing the wine with highly offensive and vulgar language, detailing its smell and taste in graphic terms.  Anthony, initially a guest on the show, left the studio to embark on a trip, continuing the commentary via phone call while driving.  This segment was interspersed with commercial breaks.

Next, the show featured Big Kev recounting a bizarre incident involving Linda Blair at the Chiller Theater Convention.  Opie and Anthony's prank of repeatedly chanting "The power of Christ compels you!" during a phone interview led to Kev's ejection by Blair's security. This was followed by a rambling discussion about the hosts' hatred of trees, punctuated by offensive remarks.  A story about an autistic boy banned from church was also recounted, containing numerous offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Duff McKagan of Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses.  They discussed the band's split with Scott Weiland, the challenges of working with difficult lead singers, internet rumors, and McKagan's personal struggles with alcoholism, including a near-fatal pancreatic incident and his subsequent sobriety.  McKagan also shared anecdotes about Kurt Cobain and other musicians like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Alice in Chains.  The interview included a humorous critique of a song submitted for consideration as a potential Velvet Revolver track and an enthusiastic, bizarre interaction with a superfan, Eastside Dave, who displayed his intense admiration in an overtly inappropriate manner, including exposing himself. McKagan promoted his band Loaded and his autobiography.  The interview was rife with profanity and explicit references to substance abuse and bodily functions.

A segment followed featuring a discussion of the new Indiana Jones movie, with Opie, Anthony, Jim Jefferies, and Joe DeRosa expressing strong negative opinions.  A humorous song about the hosts' contrasting tastes was performed.  The discussion moved to the practical effects versus CGI, and included a call from Judah Friedlander promoting his radio show.  The majority of this segment involved graphic sexual conversations, often homophobic and transphobic, with detailed descriptions and anecdotes, including mockery of a caller, "Psycho Bob," and a bet regarding movie release dates. A video clip of a comedian assaulting an elderly woman was also discussed and deemed humorous. Jim Jefferies shared an embarrassing story about his mother’s reaction to his online presence and a drunken strip club encounter. Additional callers shared anecdotes involving transgender individuals.

A caller then shared his views on his attractiveness in Britain versus the US, employing vulgar language and stereotypes.  He expressed strong negative opinions about John Lennon and Paul McCartney, recounting an anecdote at the Dakota building.  This led to a discussion about Mark Chapman and advocating for his execution. The conversation included discussions of British accents, films like *Pulp Fiction*, *Reservoir Dogs*, and *A Clockwork Orange*, and the *Back to the Future* trilogy, specifically Biff Tannen.  The segment concluded with an interview of "Stalker Patty," who was subjected to a series of vulgar and sexually suggestive questions from the hosts that resulted in her being pressured to allow several people to smell her fingers after touching her genitals. This segment concluded with Patty visibly distressed and the hosts continuing their sexually explicit comments.

The final segment featured Patty Duffy, a female guest, recounting a difficult childhood marked by abuse from her brother (present in the studio) and a schizophrenic mother.  She discussed being abandoned, placed in foster care, and experiencing physical abuse. The hosts engaged in crude humor, often interrupting her.  The discussion covered her social isolation, lack of close relationships, and virginity. The hosts expressed shock and morbid amusement. A planned hypnotism session was mentioned, alongside numerous advertisements.  The segment ended with a brief, angry phone call, a short appearance by Judah Friedlander, and a snippet of a drunken song about being a “naked cowboy.”

[00:00:00]  At this place, four bedrooms, two baths.  Yeah, I know.  Jeez, you're not even 30.  We have the same salary, Maggie.  How can you afford all this?  My mortgage payment is less than $300 a month.  What?  That's less than I pay for rent.  How did you...  All I did was call B&I for a list of homes that are being sold for back taxes or foreclosure.  Home foreclosures are on the rise.  That means there are great deals out there, especially for first-time homebuyers.  Like this listing, a four-bedroom, two-bath going for under $20,000.  That's just $199 a month.  Listings go fast, so call B&I for a list of these homes today. 
[00:00:30]  Call 1-800-700-3082.  I could actually afford to own my own home.  Yeah, and it's easy.  Just call B&I for the list.  Properties that have been foreclosed or repossessed are a real bargain and sometimes sell for a little money down.  For a list of homes in your area, call 1-800-700-3082.  1-800-700-3082.  That's 1-800-700-3082.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-Canada, 877-438-9677. 
[00:01:00]  The virus.  The enemy show.  Who you trying to get crazy with, Whitey?  Don't you know I'm loco?  I hear that train coming, coming round the bend. 
[00:01:30]  I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know where.  I'm stuck in Folsom prison.  Time keeps dragging on. 
[00:02:00]  That train just keeps the road.  On down the sand and tone.  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy.  Don't ever play with guns.  When I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die. 
[00:02:30]  When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry.  What the hell?  How y'all feel out there?  Before storytelling.  Before and work.  OK.  Beforeitero.  Oh-oh.  How y'all feel about me?  We do.  When I shoot down, just like a baby.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  You wake all up.  I follow up.  It's in.  Yeah.  greetedo.  It's probably rich folks eating in a fancy dining car  They're probably drinking whiskey and smoking big cigars  Well, I know I had it coming  I know I can't be free  Those people keep on moving 
[00:03:30]  And that's what tortures me  I can't be free 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  We're talking like a regular guy now.  That's only because he told you to.  Why don't you do what's in your soul?  Nah, I'm a changed man.  Be a jock.  Nah, I'm just going to go with whatever we want to do.  We're performing.  We're putting on a show here for the people.  D-Rock, why am I not on your hero list anymore?  Not hero list?  I've been wanting to know the answer to that for a long time.  That MySpace has been nuked.  There's nothing on it.  Yeah, but you took him off the hero list before you nuked it. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  And why?  Why?  Behind the scenes politics.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it because you didn't want Ant to get jealous because he's not on your hero list?  Oh, no.  Four years later, he's over it by now.  Good thing he doesn't listen to Worst of.  All right.  And this is the worst of Opie Native.  Let's talk about some wines from Dr. Steve and Stephen Bayshore.  Okay.  So, what about it?  No, you didn't introduce that.  All right, I'm kind of confused.  Why are you guys turning the best of Opie and Anthony, or the worst of Opie and Anthony, 
[00:06:00]  into the Sam and E-Rock show?  We want to do radio.  Is anybody on to this yet?  We just figured we found some open mics.  Let's grab them.  We saw an opportunity.  We seized it.  Yeah.  It's not about you guys.  It's not?  No.  Who's it about?  It's vacation.  I've heard these Worst of shows.  There's less and less of Opie and Anthony, more of Sam and E-Rock.  Well, it's not our fault the company said, look, do what you can to squeeze as much of  them out of the Worst of shows and come up with new content.  So, what you're saying is SiriusXM is incompetent, and they don't know what they're doing with 
[00:06:30]  this show.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Pete and Anthony show.  I think what E-Rock was saying is he just, SiriusXM said, we heard the first test tapes.  Yeah.  We did test tapes.  Yeah.  And they said, what we need is more Sam and E-Rock stuff.  Really?  Yes, that's what's going on.  All right, what are we talking about here?  Dr. Steve's wine.  Yeah, Opie likes the finer things in life.  Opie enjoys some good wine.  And some of our friends feel the need to provide some of their own wines to Opie.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is one of them. 
[00:07:00]  He makes his own.  Let me make a blanket statement here.  Homemade wine sucks a dick.  And that's going on the record.  You can put that in your signature on Wagbag.  You can put it up on your Twitters.  You can put it anywhere.  Post it on drsteve.com.  Yes.  I know people mean well, but homemade wine sucks a dick.  Unless your last name is Mondavi.  Yes.  If your name is Mondavi and you want to make some wine, I'll give it a shot.  Or Yellowtail.  Yellowtail sucks a dick. 
[00:07:30]  Yellowtail is an awful wine.  It really is.  What about Gato Negro?  I don't know what that is.  It's Black Cat.  It's a $7 bottle of Negro.  Oh, okay.  And that's why I don't know what it is.  Didn't Stump Brain make his own wine or something?  Oh, yeah.  No.  Yes.  I think so.  I think he does.  He's that type of guy.  And he had that wine in his office that came in coffins that he'd special order.  I don't know, but Ope's afraid of coffins.  Scorch told me, so he wouldn't like any of that wine.  Actually, I'm afraid of this chemistry.  It's just amazing.  I'm going to just sit back and watch the chemistry ensue. 
[00:08:00]  You told me I should try new partners.  This is it.  Oh, wow.  Number four.  What, everyone else said no?  Look, we're trying new things.  We're young in the business.  Yes.  Look, I'm going to give you a little something.  I'm a wine snob.  Absolutely.  I don't know how that happened being a poor white kid from Long Island, but I, yeah, I  like a good bottle of wine.  And if you're going to bring wine by, I will check it on wine.com.  That is a true thing that happens.  And the homemade wine gets poured down the drain before you even turn your back. 
[00:08:30]  Because I like to see the pain in your face as I do it to you.  So in Dr. Steve's case, you smash it into a garbage can on the national radio.  Oh, did I do that?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh.  So here for yourself, how it feels to have somebody smash your gift to bits on the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show.  This sucks camel dicks!  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're failures!  Failures!  Well, we got our first Christmas gift of the season, so we're going to open it up live 
[00:09:00]  at our show.  Oh!  We're very picky when it comes to our Christmas gifts.  Goodies.  Meaning that we don't get many Christmas gifts.  No.  Because people are scared to, like, try to send in something that we might like.  Go ahead, try to please us.  I dare you.  Yeah.  We suck.  Yeah, try sending a really expensive bottle of Cabernet.  I dare you.  Hope you'll look it up online and see how much it costs.  What a fuck.  That's great.  Just look it up and go, bah, cheap shit. 
[00:09:30]  Apparently Steve from Bayshore went to piss.com to get the wine he left at Ops Brothers Restaurant.  Steve gave me a talking toe.  He goes, dude, you do realize that the wine was very good.  And then I did look it up for real and went, fuck!  No, it wasn't.  It was not good.  Some newscaster fell out of the fucking thing while she was making it.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  It was fucking awful.  It was like someone took the diapers of a cancer patient and danced on them. 
[00:10:00]  I said, here you go.  Now put a cork in this and give it to someone.  Some wine.  Yeah.  Some sausage.  Sausage.  Some shit.  Yeah, shit.  And you give it to Ops in a bottle.  Terrible fucking gift.

We understand we have to bleep out  This pisses off the XM Nation  But you know  There's a whole bunch of people  That are hearing this part of the show  So we feel like it's worth  Replaying from yesterday  You want me to tell you  What was bleeped?  Well  Hint to it  Hint to it  Let's see how good you are  At Terrestrial Radio  Go ahead  Go ahead Danny  We bleeped A-H right?

Like an excretory  P  Oh okay  That probably got dumped  Oh really?  No  I probably described it too much  That probably got dumped  Because it's the word  It's not just the first letter  It's the word itself  It's like being angry 
[00:38:30]  You might as well have just said the word  Yeah  Alright well  Well they dumped this  Tinkle  Can you say that  The word  Tinkle  It's such a silly word  It's so harmless  Alright so we got the TV edit  Yesterday the set up  Before we go to break here  We were talking about smoothies and stuff  I think maybe the set up is on this  A little bit  No it starts with you wanting to go to break  Okay so then we were getting ready to go to break  And we hear this  What sounded like someone going 
[00:39:00]  Mmhmm  Mmhmm  Agreeing  Someone agreed with me when I said my smoothie was warm  Right  And you hear mmhmm  In the background  Yeah  I turned to my left  I thought it was Z-Rock  And I started getting confused  I didn't say a word thank God  And Anthony pretty much put his foot in his mouth  Oh I certainly did  And he wanted an answer  He wanted to know who was talking to him  Little did I know  It was Jimmy's little hairless white backside  I got scared  So here it is from yesterday with the TV edit 
[00:39:30]  Because we got to play it over here today  Mmhmm  Alright we'll take a break I guess  No  Why not  I don't want to take a break  I don't have to  That smoothie by the way  Was lukewarm  What  I thought I heard mmhmm  Who said that  Did someone say something  Do you know  Did you say that  I swear to God  I got a gasser  And it went  Your ass talked to me  No you totally answered it  I answered your ass

[00:56:00]  Well  If the road was blocked  Because this is also the area  Where big rigs back  Into these warehouses  And block the road  For like fucking ten minutes  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And then that's when  I make my sidewalk moves  But if this guy decides  He's gonna do it  I could do it  But the cop vehicle  That would be really funny  They would just  Look at me like  I'm a real asshole  All right  Oh, there he goes  Okay  Yeah, so  Okay, we're done  I got  I got nothing  Going on here  It's the easy

Well, this isn't  The E! Entertainment  True Hollywood story  We're here to talk about 
[01:03:00]  Big Kev  No, look  The prison scene's  My wallpaper on the phone  Oh my gosh  Nice  That's disgusting  I  Back in those days  I didn't actually  Do the interviews  Per se  What I would do  Is set up the interview  Pretty much  I would  Set the  Person to be interviewed  Up to call the studio  And then the boys  Would of course  Take over  And take care of the interview  And at that point  Usually  I would not be present  Or I would be present  On another phone 
[01:03:30]  Listening for a natural break point  To cue the  Quote celebrity  That, you know  That the interview  You know  To wrap up  And so on  So you were at the cons  Like saying  We're gonna  Can you talk live?  Yes  Like you'd call in  Like you'd do it  At the Friday  Because we were in  Afternoon Drive  Right  You know  That block of time  I was able to get  Those interviews  Live from the convention floor  And some of them  Were very funny  Obviously  But in the case  Of Linda Blair  Linda Blair  Would not  Would only accept 
[01:04:00]  The phone number  From me  She didn't want me  To be there  Because she was  Preparing  You know  Whatever that means  I guess  And she didn't  Want me there  And I was fine  With that  Because quite frankly  At that point  You know  I didn't need  To do anything  So I gave her  The phone number  I coordinated  With the show's  Producer at the time  I can't remember  What his name is  Dick  I think it was Sam  I think it was Dick  And I coordinated  With Dick  And then I walked away  I walked back  To the convention  I did my  I did my  I was doing my shopping  And so on and so forth 
[01:04:30]  And then about  Half an hour later  Four of their biggest  Security people  Surround me on the floor  And tell me  That I have to come with them  They escort me  To the front of the convention  Front of the hotel  And they say  That I am  I am not welcome  At Chiller  And because of  What occurred  With Linda Blair  Well we don't have  Any time to play  The bit now  For that  So that was  The Linda Blair  Has been corner  With Big Kev  Here on the  Worst of Opie and Anthony  Who the fuck  Is listening  To the worst  Who's fucking listening

[01:07:00]  Oh, man.  I didn't know half that stuff.  Devin's dying over there.  Devin wanted to do this to me.  I'm afraid.  Devin, Devin, why are you doing this?  Devin.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh, geez, I can't breathe.  Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter? 
[01:07:30]  Holy Jesus.  Are you insane?  Hey, kiss her.  I'm glad she hung up.  I don't know how much longer I could have done that.  Oh, Jesus.  I still think the Ruth Bozzi one was better.  Yeah.  No, I learned more from this one.  Yeah?  She's like, hello, hello.  I'm hanging up.  Three, two, one.  I'm bored.  She was speaking like the devil.  She was possessed.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  Maybe she'd have been more interested if we spoke English backwards.

[01:09:30]  Shut up.  Well, the one time you said Pin Lawton.  Pin Lawton.  I'm going to rub him out.  I'm a stroke.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  E-Rock is me.  I'm Sam.  And with another exceedingly long introduction is Big Kev.  So then.  Wait, apparently we found part two of this that maybe we won't get to play either.  So let's hear what this one was about.  So after they had done this to Linda Blair, as I said, their security people escorted me out 
[01:10:00]  and kicked me out into the rain and said I was no longer welcome at Chiller Theater Convention because of what had happened.  And I had no idea.  So I called in and this is what happened.  How much tape do we have?  That's it.  I'm done.  I just segned it right in for you.  Because we have a limited amount.  I just, I just, and I said hear it and I segned it right in.  You could go right into the bit and you had to chime in.  It's a limited amount of time. 
[01:10:30]  With your terrible hair and your awful jokes.  Yes, I don't have the bit.  We don't have the bit.  Oh, I'll keep them going.  So Big Kev's Greek Stuff, if you want anything Greek, whether it be food or like a dessert or the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding,  you can find it all at bigkevstuff.net.  And enjoy this.

[01:11:00]  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  But she's like royalty at this thing and I was bodily removed.  Stop it.  That must have taken a lot of bodies.  I was removed from the Chiller Theater Convention in Secaucus.  What happened?  How did it go down?  I was shopping, preparing for my interview with Adam West. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  And four or five security persons approached me and said,  Big Kev, you have to come with us.  They called you Big Kev?  Yes.  They led me outside of the hotel and they said that my presence was no longer appreciated  at the Chiller Theater Convention this year.  Oh my God.  This year.  Oh, Big Kev.  Yes.  They got a lot of free mentions though. 
[01:12:00]  I know.  I don't understand.  I don't know what you guys did to Linda Blair because I wasn't with her during the call.  Why weren't you?  Some people say it was our best interview ever before.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what you did, but they are pissed.  Oh, you don't know what we did?  No.  You weren't standing next to her?  No.  Actually, she was getting ready and so I just phoned it in and she did it all on her own.  I wasn't there.  Oh, oh.  I have no idea and they won't tell me. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, no.  When they escorted me out, I asked them what happened and they said, we don't want to talk  about it, but it was plenty horrible is what it was.  It wasn't all that bad.  I think whatever you did must not have been her brand of humor.  I think she got a little impatient with us and perhaps it was a little monotonous.  Yeah, yeah.  But a little repetitive.  A little repetitive.  What did you do?  Just tell me what you did.  Well, just, okay. 
[01:13:00]  Picture, picture you're Linda Blair.  Wow, that's really a tough one.  Okay.  Let's just imagine you're hearing what Linda Blair was hearing.  Okay?  Okay.  We pick up the phone.  There you are, Linda Blair.  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  And, Kev, it didn't stop, no matter what she said.  Until she hung up, right? 
[01:13:30]  Twice, yes.  Unbelievable.  Yes.  It was some people saying our best celebrity interview to date.  Let me tell you.  They brought their five biggest guys to escort me out like I had killed somebody.  Oh, my God.  Linda Blair is like a, I told you, she's like royalty at this place.  Really?  Oh, man.  Right away, she called down and I was removed.  I'm standing out in the rain now.  Oh, Kev.  Oh, I love that visual. 
[01:14:00]  Well, yeah.  I'm really upset because, you know, you guys are now going to miss the opportunity to talk  to Adam West.  You were setting up an Adam West interview?  Wow.  Superstar Adam West was prepared to talk on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Wow.  Damn.  All right, Kev.  Better luck in two years.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  People asking, Joey Big Arm saying, did Big Kev ask for his Ticketmaster Service charge back?  No, I didn't pay. 
[01:14:30]  Did Adam West try to remove him like Big Kev was a supervillain?  Yeah, that was it.  And why couldn't you get the guy that was in the ALF suit?  Actually, you know what?  I was looking for Bob May, but he's not here this time around.  Oh, I hope he's not ill.  One of our more famous interviews.  And it doesn't matter anyway because I've been removed.  All right, Big Kev.  Why don't you try to get back in and smooth things over?  I'll try to get back in, but I don't think it's going to happen. 
[01:15:00]  Promise.  Tell him, you know, we'll give him a bunch of great plugs.  Okay, I'll see what I can do.  All right.  Thanks, Big Kev.  Later.  There he goes.  Hey, this is Big Kev.

[01:19:30]  The virus.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Trees are shit thicks.  Petrified forest.  Bunch of fucking scared trees.  Fucking knock it over already.  Boo.  Faggots.  What the fuck do we need trees for?  Just make air.  Photosynthesis.  Really?  Photosynthesis.  Spies photosynthesis. 
[01:20:00]  Remember I said this.  Trees are for queers.  I don't value fucking plant life at all.  It's shit.  Hey, you're eating it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I'm not eating plant life.  I'm eating some tuna.  No, the celery was there.  The celery's just sitting there.  No one thinks about plant life as life.  Fucking step on it all the time.  If there were little fucking baby puppies on your front property instead of grass, would  you walk all over it?  And cut it, yes.  And cut it?  I'm going to mow the fucking grass just as it's starting to grow up and come of age. 
[01:20:30]  It's starting to see the world finally.  We have to mow it with our mowers.  I want to see a baby sapling and fucking just karate kick it.  I've always wanted to be big just so I could fucking bend trees with my foot.  Baby sapling?  Like a little one.  Just like a little sap comes out.  Yeah.  The first apple is hanging off it and I just come over and break it.  But it's so happy that it's finally growing fruit.  A little sapling.  I know.  I can't do that to the little fella.  You should see the look on a tree's face when I fucking hook a handcuff up to my fucking 
[01:21:00]  trailer hitch and I drive away with it.  Just rip it out by the roots and giggle.  What do you think of that, stupid?  Fucking hate trees.  So overrated.  Joyce Kilmer was a fucking douchebag.  Fools were...  Oh, it was...  Poems are wrote by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.  Joyce Kilmer sucked.  How do you even know that, though?  That's a very famous quote about his shitty poem. 
[01:21:30]  Stupid.  Fuck the trees.  You're right.  Birds hang out and shit all over your car.  It's not helpful.  I hate blades of grass, too.  A blade of grass.  Yeah.  Just cut it all.  Make cement.  Fuck the difference.  Parking lots.  All front yards should be parking lots.  Not handier.  Exactly.  All your friends, you come over.  Park anywhere.  What happened to those...  They were annoying me.  They were blocking my view.  Fucking cut them all down.  Pave the whole joint over. 
[01:22:00]  Fucking bowl in the front yard, if you want to know.  We gotta go, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  So I guess you're enjoying these wildfires, Jimmy, if you don't like trees.  I love them.  There's nothing that makes me happier than seeing a bunch of black just smoke where trees used  to be.  I fucking love it.  Like when you see a landscape and they're all even, all even Steven.  Even Steven.  But they're, look, it looks sad. 
[01:22:30]  That's where trees and bushes and plant life was, Jimmy.  Exactly.  What do they do to stop the fire?  Trees beg for fire.  They really are.  I'd rather have gas cans in front of my house.  They're fucking totally worthless.  How do they beg for fire?  They do nothing.  Every year there's fire and every year they just stand there like dummies and take it.  How about you fucking, you drip a little, you save some rain water or something, you  fucking asshole. 
[01:23:00]  They just drink it up like dopes.  Spit some rain water back at it.  They just, they just, they're built to be walked on.  Fucking birds live in them.  Fucking like bees hang out on them.  We make paper out of them.  They do nothing.  We wipe our assholes with trees.  Is that great?  Big, big, mighty creature.  That's what you get.  Anything that wants to fuck with a tree can.  They have no defense.  Oh, God.  Fucking bark.  So they should save some of the water and keep themselves nice and moist.  Of course they shouldn't. 
[01:23:30]  Next time a fire comes, they fucking contribute a little.  They're just waiting for us to do all the legwork.  Sit there waiting for the fire.  Well, they do.  They're probably just shaking, like looking at each other like, is someone going to help?  I cannot wait to see that animation.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let me unzip.  Okay, church bans autistic kid.  Listen to this story.  This is amazing.  Raising a son with severe autism is not easy, but for the race family, church makes things easier. 
[01:24:00]  That's our strength.  That's how we get through all of this.  I know why they banned him.  Why?  Because obviously they thought his mind was the playground of the devil.  Get it?  Because it's idle.  I love the get it.  Ta-da.  God.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, I know.  I banned him.  The church was rather insensitive as to the reasons they gave. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  They said God couldn't and wouldn't do that to a good boy.  They said your kid gives everyone the creeps.  They feel like he's a walking decoupage.  See that?  Right back in.  Bing.  Right back to the decoupage.  Bing.  The race family, church, makes things easier.  That's our strength.  That's how we get through all of this. 
[01:25:00]  Just 13 years old, Adam Race is already six feet tall and 235 pounds.  Towering.  Adam Race?  I wonder if he's funny and people would say Adam Race is a riot.  This kid's a monster.  He's 13 years old.  He's over six foot tall, over 235 pounds.  Which makes things easier.  That's our strength.  That's how we get through all of this.  They hate.  They hate. 
[01:25:30]  Whenever he tries to make like a batch of cake batter or something, they just hate the  way race mixes.  You're cracking yourself up today.  I know.  I'm over tired.  I got an hour and a half of sleep last night.  Fucking.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see what this is all about.  We get through all of this.  Just 13 years old, Adam Race is already six feet tall and 235 pounds.  Jesus.  Towering over Carol Levin reporter Juliana Olsen. 
[01:26:00]  That size is a concern for his church, which was granted a temporary restraining order to  keep Adam out of mass.  He's got to get a restraining order.  Wow.  To keep him out of church?  Jesus.  Keep him out of church.  I haven't been doing the same thing.  We don't want him running around knocking over gold statues.  Fuck him.  Leave him in purgatory.  Oh, good God.  Back to the autistic kid who's been banned from church. 
[01:26:30]  This fucking kid needs church.  What the fuck is wrong with the church?  The church says it was a last resort.  In court papers, Reverend Daniel Walls argues Adam's behavior at mass is extremely disruptive  and dangerous.  He bolts unexpectedly from church and is nearly knocked over people, Walls says.  He spits and urinates.  And when relatives try to restrain him, he fights and makes loud noises.  Once, Walls says, Adam struck a child during mass, something his family does acknowledge.  It was one of those things where I was pushing him to go up to communion that morning. 
[01:27:00]  I was wrong to do that.  I made a mistake.  And Father Walls said, and I was trying to fuck the lad at the time.  I'm Terry Punchim.  Communion.  They should put their hand out with a fucking Xanax in it.  Eat this, you big stoop.  Eat this, you fucking nuisance.  No one wants you.  No one wants you here.  Eat this and take a nap in a fucking confessional while we all worship. 
[01:27:30]  Running up and down the pews, knocking down people's children.  I don't blame the church in this case.  Can't have some fucking big lunk biting everybody and fucking throwing psalm books up in the air,  causing a big to-do.  It's not about you, douchebag.  It's about the hereafter.  It's about the Lord and eternity, not the here and now.  So beat it, stupid.  What a fucking blithering attention whore.  Jimmy, Jimmy, someone writes, how about when Adam goes fishing? 
[01:28:00]  He's a race baiter.  That's right.  I didn't even get that.  Oh, that's hilarious.  That's right.  They don't blame the church.  They're trying to conduct a, you know, and then Paul's letter to the Corinthians.  He bit me.  The stoop bit me. 
[01:28:30]  And parishioners, remember, the Lord loves you.  The Lord wants to keep you.  Could someone throw that retard at me?  That lunk.  Tyler from Columbus writes, the problem is that the priest didn't want to touch someone who could fight back. 
[01:29:00]  13, he's building like fucking La Mata.  All right.  These are the jewels from the belt.  You want to hear more about the autistic kid that's been from church or what?  Of course.  All right.  Jesus.  But they say Adam does not spit and the urination is incontinence.  Above all, they feel his behavior is improving.  They don't understand what's going in through Adam's mind when he behaves. 
[01:29:30]  Exactly.  I'll tell you what, a dust bunny is going through his mind.  A fucking tumbleweed.  Cares what's going through his mind.  What's coming out of his mouth and his stick that nobody gives a shit about.  And his shit up.  I don't care how dry his thoughts are.  The front of his pants are wet.  How about this?  How about this?  If he thinks about piss, but doesn't do it.  He's reversed the opposite.  What's going through his mind? 
[01:30:00]  I don't know, being in a pool, a constant rainfall, running water of some sort.  Well, Chester's liver.  After he was tossed out of church, he became addicted to heroin.  And now he's covered in anyone?  Shit?  Racetracks.  Oh, wow.  Racetrack.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  More about the autistic boy.  It's improving.  They don't understand what's going through Adam's mind when he behaves the way he does. 
[01:30:30]  All they see are the externals.  Carol was planning to defy the order this morning.  It's going on over his head.  It's a speeding bird.  It's flying around his head along with stars and little planets.  Dolt.  Oh, that's hilarious.  They don't see beyond the hat with the propeller on.  They only see the externals. 
[01:31:00]  You dumb bitch.  That's all anybody sees.  What do you think?  We look at each other's innards?  If they could only see my liver, you'd be dead.  He can't help but speak in tongues.  His mouth is full of one.  Shoddy Carpenter.  Very nice.  He wears an I'm with me shirt. 
[01:31:30]  Let's go to Chris in Georgia.  Chris.  Hey, good morning.  Father, why is the holy water yellow this morning?  There we go.  All right, let's go back here.  Carol was planning to defy the order this morning and take Adam back to St. Joseph's.  But as she left her home, Todd County Sheriff warned her she would be arrested.  So today she took her kids to another church.  But plans to keep fighting. 
[01:32:00]  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  He also created fucking Tasmanian devils.  You don't want to bring one into the church.  He also created fucking bee swarms and AIDS and shit.  You don't want to fucking throw them around the pews, do you?  Well, God created Wolverines, so I figured I'd throw one into the middle of the ceremony.  Fucking assholes, shut up.  God also created condoms and blowjobs.  He also created fucking rubber rooms and fucking medication and coat hangers. 
[01:32:30]  Holy shit.  Jimmy's crying.  I'm so far more than anybody.  I'm out of my fucking mind here.  He's killing me.  Holy shit.  It makes perfect sense.  Just because God created the little fuckers.  Exactly.  God also created fucking television. 
[01:33:00]  Why don't you watch the ceremony at home?  To keep fighting.  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  Yeah, I'm sure that's what the fucking grand savior is like.  He's some fucking blithering fool just running around the universe breaking glass unicorns.  Oh, fuck.  Dickie Punchcock writes, Cain and unable. 
[01:33:30]  Plans to keep fighting.  God created us.  He created us in his own image and likeness.  Oh, wow.  Regardless of whatever our abilities and disabilities are.  If he was in the Bible, it would be moe haircut parted the red sea.  I had to go to the other church.  Our lady of giant retard who fucking pisses and shits himself.  Created us. 
[01:34:00]  He created us in his own image and likeness.  Regardless of whatever our abilities or disabilities are, we're all created with equal dignity.  Our lady of the immaculate paint chips.  It's too fucking much.  You know, by the way, overhand me this book of all these great celebrity musical auction they're having. 
[01:34:30]  Hard Rock Cafe, I think.  Yeah.  Hard Rock Johnny gave us that.  They got some Beatles stuff, which is pretty interesting.  Right here I want to get the, you know what hours they want for the, for the, for the, the George.  The, the George Harrison hat with gutters. 
[01:35:00]  Your face is beet red.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's crazy.  Look at you.  Fuck you.  God.  Love, get me me hat 
[01:35:30]  Me shoulders are getting wet  Why is there pudding on me pillow?  He was always accused of a fucking Bill Cosby  She goes, you don't seem to understand what's happening to him  Oh, fuck  Oh, my chest hurts 
[01:36:00]  I'm laughing too hard here  I can't, I'm crying  Going back to the autistic kid  Shay in Connecticut writes that  He was  The unwanted conception  What the hell  God damn  And now, the worst  Black of Opie and Anthony  This show sucks  It's awful 
[01:36:30]  Wow, as a kid, my  My first recollection of porn was me drawing, like, dirty pictures  Dirty pictures?  Because I couldn't get my hands on the good stuff  So I would draw, like, primitive boobies and stuff  And then I would jerk off to my drawings  Oh, God  You jerked off to your own drawings?  I'm good  Who does that?  I just remembered  Oh, you rock well?  That's fine  I just remembered, right?  Yeah, he's great  Here's the kid running away  I have a vivid memory 
[01:37:00]  I used to, like, try  And then I would, like,  I would, like, try to learn how to draw better  So my drawings would look better  So your drawings would be a little more realistic  I just remembered this  There was this guy  Remember the back of the magazines  They would teach you how to draw?  Yeah  You know, I would do that  But then make them, like, naked girls and stuff  Dude, there was a kid named  And I remember his name  Peter Palagonia  And it was at Cuba Hill Elementary School  And he fucking was an artist  Yeah  In elementary  And he could draw nude girls  And everyone in the playground 
[01:37:30]  Like, during recess  We'd be like, dude  That's what I was doing  Could you draw a picture?  And he was fast  And he could fucking draw  And he'd be like, thanks  And just, I'd sit in my class  And keep it in my notebook  And just open it up  And get a boner  And then just sit there with my boner  In class  Me and my boner  And my Peter Palagonia drawing  That was grammar school  That was grammar school crack  That was, like, drugs, man  Yeah  Yeah, but we had the same thing  My junior high school  We had the one kid  Who was, like, ridiculously good  At sketching stuff  And we wouldn't have him do that 
[01:38:00]  But we would have him draw  All of our teachers  Doing funny stuff  Like, I remember  We had a math teacher  Mr. Decker  And, you know, so we'd have  So he would draw Mr. Decker  Like, with his dick in his head  And we would think  We would think it was  The funniest thing ever  Did he ever draw Mr. Albert Decker?  Mr. Decker's shitting  And so I said  Mr. Decker, it's him  Punching his wife in the mouth  Which I  I found out once I left that school  That, uh, back  He was at that school forever  And he actually changed his name  From Mr. Dicker  For obvious reasons  Oh, Mr. Dicker? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah  No kidding  Shit  Mr. Decker's a shit dicker  You can't be a fucking teacher  With a Mr. Dicker  Oh, God  That's so funny  That you just look for anything  For fucking sex  How did you get a rod  To your friend's drawings?  I was looking at  Dude, he  I'm so with Anthony  This kid drew really well  Really well  I remember  And, like, the proportion  Of the ass and the tits  And he drew a little bush in there  And the nipples  And so  And he had, like  Like, you could see  Ribs and abs  He was really good 
[01:39:00]  At shading  I don't care  So I'd get it  And I'd open it up  Dude, it's elementary school  Even at that age  I had seen porn  Like, nude pictures for real  Well, fucking lucky you  I had to look at  Peter Palagonia's drawings  And get a boner  A boner  How did you get a little boner?  The guy who draws  No way out  On the side of the walls  Couldn't draw pictures of tits  I got a boner  For my own drawings, man  Oh, yeah  I fucking told you  And then you would find  Somebody that drew better  And you would make sure  They drew you  Naked women pictures  I forgot all about this  Until today  I'd go to the  Pajama section  Of the catalogs, too 
[01:39:30]  When we get the big catalogs  They would come in  Sears catalogs  Go to the pajama section  And just look at girls  And fucking boner  I got you beat up  Get my boner  I would go to the  Bosom cream ads  Bosom cream?  In Sears catalog?  No, they made  The girls' bosoms bigger  It was some kind of cream  What fucking magazine  Did you have, though?  I don't remember  Exactly  What kind of cream is that?  I think it was  In the back of my  My sister's magazine  Yeah, like  Women's magazines  My sister was like  Five years older than me  So she got those magazines  And just reading  Some of the stuff in there 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah  As like a 12-year-old  And some pictures  Were pretty cool  They didn't have to be naked  You know, it was just enough  To see girls in like  Bra pictures  They'd wear pajamas  Where the top is like  A midriff  And you could see  Their belly and stuff  I remember  That was just scrap city  I think I jerked off  To a J.C. Penney catalog once  Just from home  Yeah, just the bra  They're so unsexy  J.C. Penney catalogs  It didn't matter at that age  Yeah  Bra catalogs  With big pointed fucking tits  Just bra and panties  And like, you know 
[01:40:30]  Like they have that nude color  So it just kind of  Like they were naked  Yeah, you squint a little  Just imagine nipples  Yeah  Anthony's right  You just squint  Yeah, you squint  And they were nude  Yeah  Creepy story on line four  We say hi to Rob  Rob  Hey, what's up guys?  How you doing?  Good  Okay, when I was  This is a little creepy  When I was a kid  When I would take a shower  If I found like  Let's say  A long hair  From my mom  Or sister or whatever  I would put it on  Like the wall of the shower  And it would stick  And I would sort of 
[01:41:00]  Shape the hair  Like an outline of a boob  Or two boobs  Even like pinch the hair  To make nipples  And I would scrap to that  Holy shit  That's primitive  Yeah  That is primitive  You would jerk off  To a fucking  Picture of a guy  With a spear  On a wall  In a cave somewhere  Jesus Christ  Your mom's hair  What would you do  If you saw  A little teeny short one  Make it into a circle  And try to shoot your load in it  Get it  It's a pube joke  I'm sorry to the nice couple out there  I've done a lot of vag references  I apologize 
[01:41:30]  Alright, look, man  Dude, what the fuck  Did we get ourselves into?  Earmuffs, Milf  Earmuffs  Earmuffs  I don't want you to hear  This next one  Yeah, you gotta get the lady  Some earmuffs  Motherfucking earmuffs  Foreskin, what's up?  Hey, man  I used to scrap  To the instructions  On a box of tampons  Oh, right  It would show the girl  The outline of everything  It would show the girl  With her leg up on the toilet, right?  Really?  Yeah, yeah  And it was like a cross-section  Of a vag, though 
[01:42:00]  So it was like a girl  Cut in half  Which is even hotter  When I was caddying  At the Huntington Crescent Club  Caddying  Another memory  That I have forgotten  Until today  You fucked one of the holes  Yeah  That someone put a flag  In your hiney  And you drew it  I found a tampon  In one of the golf bags  Of the ladies  I was caddying for  And I ran home with that  And studied it  And then buried  Buried it in the woods 
[01:42:30]  You buried it in the woods?  What the fuck are you?  With my other  Masturbation  Paraphernalia  Thank you  How did you masturbate  To that?  Well, I didn't  It was just  I didn't actually  Masturbate to the tampon  But it was just so like  So like taboo  And dirty  For like a 12 year old  So I had to run home with it  And then I had to  I had to bring it to  To the woods  Why to the woods?  Because you couldn't have  A tampon in your room

[01:48:00]  Yeah  That's what some of the people call us  I never  Yeah  I remember that  Thinking that we  Smoked the weed  Well I think you did that on purpose  Totally  Dude you pick up  Totally  The latest from Pot USA  What's up Duff  How are you  Good morning  Hey guys  Safe to say  A huge fan of pretty much everything you've done  Everything  Pretty much  I mean  I gotta start with Velvet Revolver  I was a huge fan  Sweet  Huge  What happened  Well there's no was  We're going on  Well no I understand that 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  Which is cool  Well how are you gonna get a new lead singer  Carefully I guess  Do you have anybody in mind  We actually  Yeah we've worked with a couple guys  Over the last month  Anyone we know  Yeah  Probably  But you don't want to say  Not yet  Not until we're sure who it is  But  Yeah it's pretty positive  I mean the thing  With  Slash  And Matt  And I  And Dave  At the end  Especially in Europe 
[01:49:00]  Our last month  Out  It was  It was kind of  It was messy  But I think it drew us  Closer musically  It was an odd  Sort of  You know  Sort of like  Under the common oppressor  You become tighter  You know  Type of thing  And  It was just  You know  We were in a situation  That was really difficult  And  We came together  And started writing amazing music  Are you saying that he just turned into an a-hole  Or was he always an a-hole  Or  You know  I don't really  Go there 
[01:49:30]  Because it's  It's pretty unnecessary  It was just  A situation that  Couldn't be helped  How's that  Right  And  We couldn't go on  And we had decided back in January  To move on without Scott  Was it his drugs  It was a combination of a lot of things  That  Just made it really hard  To do business  And go out and tour  No I ask  You know  I gotta say  I  I love Scott  He and I have a  Lot of things in common 
[01:50:00]  And  He's a hell of a front man  However  I think  The way I  Foresee  Going about  Music  And moving forward  In a positive direction  And his  Vision of that  Are  Started to separate  Right  You have to be messing up though  Because you dealt with Axl for a long time  And then for you to go to a guy  Look  You're a little too dysfunctional  Yeah  I mean he really had to be screwing up  Was he isolating himself  From the rest of the band  Very much so  Yeah  Because  There's a reason I started with this  Because I was fortunate to see a pretty crazy incident 
[01:50:30]  I was sent the link of that show  That is as true as it went down  We're at the PNC Arts Center  What about a month ago  For the STP thing  I'm a huge Stone Temple Pilots fan  As well as Guns N' Roses  As well as Bell Revolver  That's why I thought this whole thing  STP is amazing  It was great  And it was a K-Rock show  And Filter got off stage  And Anthony and I went on  Just to say hey  You know  Stone Temple Pilots will be  You know  In five minutes  And then I took a seat 
[01:51:00]  And I'm not joking  Well over an hour  Were we pushing an hour and a half  At that point  Yeah  Close to an hour and a half  Well at this point  An hour  No band  So I go to Kenny  One of our guys  I go Kenny  Something's going on  So I run back stage  And I got to see  One of the DeLeo brothers  Yelling and screaming  At Scott Weiland's bus  He was in there by himself  And this DeLeo brother  Was losing his fucking mind  Because Jersey is his hometown  And he's like  You know  You're not going to do this to me  In my fucking hometown 
[01:51:30]  And then he just starts screaming  Come on out Axl  Come on out  Just screaming  And then  This is  I've told this story  A million times  And I apologize  To the faithful listeners  But I'm telling Duff  He probably could  You know  He'll find some humor  In this I guess  Then the  There was a bodyguard  That wouldn't let  You know  This particular DeLeo brother  On the bus  He was just guarding  Which I thought was weird  Because you're all in the same band  You'd think that  You guys hang out and stuff  And then finally  The  Oh  A bodyguard  A bodyguard 
[01:52:00]  In front of the bus  Yeah you know it's bleak  When you're yelling  At a big steel bus  Right  And he wanted to get on the bus  To confront Scott  And the bodyguard  Was having none of it  And then some  Woman appeared  That Scott Weiland was with  I don't know  Wife  Ex-wife  Girl  I don't know  And this DeLeo brother  Was calling her a cunt  And said  Get off my fucking door  It was so ugly  And then the bus  Opens up  And then Scott  Just comes out  Like  Weekend at Bernie's  Like he was a  Walking corpse 
[01:52:30]  And then DeLeo  Was in his face  Going  Can you even  Do the fucking show  And next thing you know  They went their separate ways  One went stage right  The other goes stage left  And literally two minutes later  They're playing their first  SDP song  How was the show?  Huh?  How was the show?  Well let's just put it this way  Then we went to Boston  For the exact same show  The next day  The Boston show was way better  So something was  Going on  In Jersey  You know it's hard to find  A front man who's not  What I call LV positive  Lead vocalist positive 
[01:53:00]  He's got it  You know  Yeah  A little bit of the  Prima Donna thing  Yeah  So it seemed to me  That whatever problems  He was having with you guys  Seems to be continuing  That's all I'm gonna say  Yeah  It wasn't us  You know  It wasn't  It's just an unfortunate  Place he's in  In his life  I think  And I hope  He pulls it together  Right  Really for the sake  Of himself  And you know  His fans  And before all of that 
[01:53:30]  You know  His family  Yeah  So  Yeah that's that  So we're  We're moving on  And it's a  It's a really positive  Thing  Slash and I  Especially we've been  Playing together  Slash has done our show  A million times  The guy is amazing  His book was amazing  Yeah  It's great  And you know  We've been playing  Together now for 23 years  Wow  And we've persevered  Through some pretty  Tumultuous times  Right  And we will  Persevere through this 
[01:54:00]  And that's what we do  You know  I guess  That's what we do  Are you excited  About the possibilities  For the new lead singer  I am  Yeah we worked  With a guy  And you know  I wish I could say  Who it is  Someone we know  Obviously  Pretty well  Yeah  He actually lives  In this town  In New York  How's that  Okay  That's a hint  Boy that's  Not many music people  Live here  But he's great  He's great  Lou Reed  Yeah  Well that would be bad  That would be badass  Wouldn't it  That would be 
[01:54:30]  Seriously badass  You know  Yeah  Or Iggy  I was just gonna say  The two of them  Trading off  You know  Yeah  Would be good  Yeah  So I mean  The possibilities  That kind of stuff  Is really fun  Right  Wow yeah  Lou Reed  That'd be killer  Yeah  But you know  Music is a thing  That I'm  I suppose  I was put here to do  And I will go on  Right on  I'm not gonna let  A situation where  A guy  Was having a tough  Time  Would life 
[01:55:00]  End my career  Or put a dent  In my career  Right  Right cool  And then we'll move on  But it has to be asked  Guns N' Roses  Ever getting the  Original  I have to  And the last time  I asked Slash  It was like  Enough about Axl  But I mean  People wanna know  Out there  Yeah  You know  There's nothing  In the cards  I think a lot's  Been said  And I don't know  Where  It amazes me  I see things  Like you know  Oh yeah  They were in talks  To do a  Nothing even 
[01:55:30]  Close to that  Yeah  With the internet  Rumors  They run rampant  You know  And it's funny  You know  Where these  Topics will come from  You know  I was  When Velvet Revolver  Started  We had this  Fan site  And I'd read all  I got caught up  In it  Reading the form  Oh no  Well I didn't  You know  It was kind of  My first time  Like wow  That's kind of  Cool  They're all  Talking about this  And  And  And  And  Somebody posted  A topic 
[01:56:00]  And they were  Asking the ages  Of the people  And  They were 14  13  And these  These are things  People are taking  Seriously  It's just some kid  Going yeah  Wouldn't that be cool  And then it  You know  It's reported  On the news  It is  Yeah  And it's  You know  Some kid in his bedroom  And  Which is great  Sure  It's a hobby for them  But  You know  These blogs get  Printed or  Whatever  Right  So then it becomes  Sort of almost  A common  Topic 
[01:56:30]  Becomes truth too  It's like  It's so easy  For just rumor  And speculation  To become true  Because somebody  Will read it  On a blog  And then tell people  Hey  Here's what I read  And no one assumes  Or wants to think  Of the source  It's just  Hey I read this  Yeah  Oh  So it must be true  It must be true  Yeah  So  Guns and Roses  You know  Perhaps one day  We're all alive  Which is something  You know  Kind of amazing  Right  That's the first hurdle 
[01:57:00]  Right  Weren't you the closest  To Axel  He and I  Also have a lot  In common  And  You gotta look at  Look at this  We went through  This amazing  Period in our lives  Together  Amazing run  And  It was a  It was a  Really unique  View of the world  From  The particular  Particular floor  We were on  And the ride  That we were on  And  Nobody else  I can't even relate  What we went through 
[01:57:30]  To  Even somebody like Dave  Who went through it too  Because we were in this  Really unique band  And  It got  People around the world  Believed in what  We were  Portraying  Sure  And that  Around the world  Not just in  Los Angeles  Or New York  And  You know  I'm talking  Every place  And  It was  Pretty stellar  Time in my life  And  So we have this 
[01:58:00]  Thing in common  And  Do you feel like  It ended too soon  Because you guys  Really had  It seemed like you had  More really good music  In you  Did you guys feel like  Guns N' Roses  Kind of  Could have kept going  A little bit longer  Or put out a couple  More albums  And it was frustrating  No  At the time  No  It  Had ran  Its course  There was  There was things  That we couldn't foresee  And  The band got huge  There was  There was people  There were  Particular people  Driving wedges  Between us  And  You know 
[01:58:30]  There was no  How to video  At the time  Like  This can happen  To you  And this can  Happen to you  And all of the  Things  Happened to us  All of the  Pitfalls  I suppose  You told me  A great story  Duff  We were talking  Duff was telling me  About this time  When  I can't remember  What's the song  That implies  Some homophobia  And you guys  Were just getting  Ripped in the press  In New York  There was some  Sort of  Anti-Semitic  Or homophobic  It's one in a million  Yeah  That song  And we were talking  A few years ago 
[01:59:00]  And you guys  Were in New York  At the time  I think you were  Playing the garden  And there were  People picketing  And going crazy  And obviously  You guys are all  Open-minded  You know  Crazy artist  Motherfuckers  Right  You're not  That's not  Who you were  And I was like  Why didn't you guys  Why didn't you  And Slash  Go talk to the press  And you guys  Were just like  That wasn't their thing  So you guys  Were just in this  Completely  Different mindset  Where it's like  Don't explain  Don't complain  Just do our thing  I think that's a good  Place to be though  Yeah absolutely  I mean that's a place  Where you can make 
[01:59:30]  Some real art  Just unfettered  Yeah  Yeah I remember  I was on a plane  I was flying  Back home to Seattle  And this flight attendant  She was  African American lady  And she  She said  Hey are you  Guns N' Roses  Like 1990  Yeah yeah  Are you really  A racist  Oh god  And I  All of a sudden  Became like  Two inches tall  And I looked at her  And I said  No  What am I supposed  To say  I said 
[02:00:00]  Of course  I'm not a racist  You know  You guys  Have a reputation  And that  That was there  For about  A year  Wow  Yeah  It was kind of tough  But  All in all  It was  An amazing  And positive  Experience  And like I said  It was a very  Unique  View  Of life  That we had  Together  And nobody  Can ever  Take that away  And perhaps  One day  We'll do  Something together  And  What happened  What happened 
[02:00:30]  With Axel  Like what happened  Not much is known  About him  Since I think  You guys broke up  In what  98  Somewhere around there  97  Yeah  In the last 10 years  You really don't know  Much about the guy  Except for the  Chinese democracy thing  But  I don't know  About the last 10 years  I mean  I think  Certain things  Happened to all of us  Not just Axel  And  And it's nobody's fault  It's just  It just happened  The wedges  Were  Put in there 
[02:01:00]  Different people  Had different motives  Outside of the band  The band  You know  Got  Huge  Beyond  Control  And  Maybe  Perhaps  If we  Could have  Had a crystal ball  And seen  What was going to happen  We could have  Maybe  Done some things  Differently  Pulled it back  And went and  Played theaters  You know  Or whatever  You know  There's a million  Different options  Insert your own  Did you know  Did you know  You guys had  Something that was  Really original  And special 
[02:01:30]  Especially at the time  Because it was pretty much  Just you know  Generic hair bands  Out at that time  And for you guys  To come out  And just bring  You know  Rock back again  You must have known  Like hey  This was kind of  Taken off  And very original  And  We were in our own bubble  Yeah  We had our own beliefs  We weren't really  Looking around  And going  Oh there's hair bands  And there's this  There's that  We were just doing  Our thing  And  We didn't give a shit  About anything else 
[02:02:00]  At all  And we were  We were a gang  We really were  And  We had  Written this music  That was  Our own  And  You know  We all had  Our different influences  And it was that  Moment in time  When  All of your influences  Came together  And you created  This thing  That sounded exactly  Like what you had  In your head  And  And you went out  Every night  And you played it  And you played it  Like it sounded 
[02:02:30]  You know  The Appetite record  Was just us playing  I mean that's what  We sounded like  And it came out  It got  Relayed onto  A two inch tape  And they made  Records of this  And it was  What we sounded like  You know  And it was that  Sort of simple thing  One of the greatest albums  Ever  Absolutely  Ever  I mean  Still to this day  You could throw that on  And you just  Wow  Somebody asked  Is the music still there  And I gotta say  As a fan  Oh yeah  Timeless  I mean  And the music's still there 
[02:03:00]  You listen to  Velvet Revolver  First record especially  But then Duff has  This kind of side  Side band loaded  Hard rock thing  That I played on  The last record  That you guys made  But they're just  Making a new record  Right now  And I was listening  To the rough mixes  On the plane  Out here last night  It is fucking killer  It is  Yeah  Guns  Appetite  Level  Just  I'm having a great time  We're gonna hold it to that Dave  It's  You gotta hear it  Yeah  Yeah  I'm having a fun  Really fun time  Right now 
[02:03:30]  Playing music  Right  It's  I  For some reason  I got really re-inspired  Last December  Or January  And started taking  Bass lessons  And really learning  My craft  And I've been  You know  Been playing guitar  A ton  Started even  Playing drums again  Right  Yeah  And I have  My friends  In Seattle  And we have  This band loaded  And we just  Made another record  And it's really killer  It's really  I'm really excited  About that  Too  You know  Yeah  It looks like 
[02:04:00]  You're having fun  I mean  I saw Velvet Revolver  A couple times  And the thing  That's very obvious  You, Slash  And the rest of you guys  Were just  Just having fun playing  Slash and I have  This thing  And it's unspoken  It's almost like  You don't care  If you sell records  You're just out there  Having a good time  And you believe  In the music  You guys created  It's about that moment  You know  When you're playing  In front of people  And feeding off  That energy  And feeding off  Of each other  On stage  And yeah  Record sales  And all that 
[02:04:30]  You know  That's a whole  Another subject  You know  Record sales  Where are they at  Now  So you can't  Really be bothered  With all of that stuff  If you're really  Creating music  For the right reason  Which is  To  Portray what  For some reason  You feel something  And you write a song  Or write a riff  And then somebody else  Slash will write  A part of  Another riff  And Matt will  Come up with something  And it's this thing  You created  And you're not 
[02:05:00]  Thinking at the time  Will this be a hit single  Right  It's just something  You believe in  And  I don't know  That's what we do  Very cool  I have a question  I wanted to ask you  Before I forget  I just want to  We're talking to  Duff McKagan  Obviously  On the OPN  After Show  What is the longest  Another band member  Made you wait  To go on stage  While an audience  Was in  Oh you gotta go  Back there  Don't you  No  I don't think  There'd be  Anybody in particular  I'm talking about  Art and music  But yeah  But it ties in  In a way  Because bands  Have always  Interested me 
[02:05:30]  Because I perform  Alone  And when I have  Bands  It's like you're  Relying on other people  I perform alone  Too sometimes  Do you  Oh  I'll get like that  Of course  I'll just do  Bipar  Whatever  Whatever happens  On the stage  I know I'm having  A good show  I can't imagine  Having to wait  For somebody else  Like the frustration  That must build up  Like what's the longest  You've ever had to wait  For anybody  You don't have to name  Who it is  Yeah yeah  Hours for these guys  Four hours  Four or five hours  Four  Could you imagine  You paid a ticket 
[02:06:00]  The band before  Guns and Roses  Goes off stage  Four hours later  I waited two and a half  Hours at the  Kingdome  To see the  To see the  Guns and Roses  Band  Yeah  Two and a half hours  After the opener  Was gone  After  Well after the  Second opener  After Motorhead  And then I waited  For an hour  To see Metallica  And then  Two and a half hours  After Metallica  Yeah  And I gotta say  It was worth it  It was  Yeah  It was awesome  I mean to hear  You know when the  Crowd starts chanting  You know 
[02:06:30]  Bullshit  Bullshit  That's really tough  You're sitting underneath  The bleachers or whatever  Wherever you're at  And you're ready to go  Yeah  And it really  I've had  That was  There were some pretty  Dark times in there  For me  Yeah  I drank a lot  And I drank more  And more  As a result  Of  You know  I was already  Predestined to be  An alcoholic  So I'm not blaming that  But yeah  Yeah  That sucks  Because then you lose  Your buzz  While you're waiting  For you know 
[02:07:00]  The other guy to show off  Or you're just  Completely hammered  One or the other  Yeah  I mean you just  See watching your  Integrity slip away  You guys don't know  Duff but I've known  Him for a long time  And his thing is like  If he says he's  Going to do something  He does it  And we've had  Little bands and gigs  We played for 20 people  You know where we  Missed a flight  And had to  Buy two first class  Tickets and get there  In two hours  Yeah  He does it  Period  You know  I'm going to be there  I'm going to do it  So I can imagine  It was excruciating  To sit back there  With somebody else  Hey  Going back to the drinking  One of the most amazing 
[02:07:30]  Things ever  In rock and roll history  Happened to Duff McKagan  Your pancreas  Exploded  From too much drinking  Yeah  Like you should not  Be here I'm thinking  Yeah  The pancreas is one of  Those organs  That's very delicate  What does it do  First of all  You get the cancer  And you're dead  Within months  I can't imagine  It's a good thing  For this thing  To explode  Well what happens  When that particular thing  Happens to a human  Is it secretes 
[02:08:00]  The acid  That digests your food  Etc  Onto the outside  Of your organs  Your intestines  And everything  And it burns  30 degree burns  Oh great  So the pain  Is  I wanted  Them to  Kill me  Yeah  What do you mean  Did it just  Did it just like  Cause like  It just kind of  Opens up  And then  One minute you're okay  And then one minute  You're in agony  It expands  You know  I think a pancreas  Is  Well  There's no TV cameras here  It's  You know  It's not 
[02:08:30]  A big  Like a plum maybe  Yeah  And it expanded  To the size  Of like half  Of a football  And then it  Mine burst  So  Yeah  That's not good  So what do they do  Sew it back together  Well  They would usually  They  I  Signed something  From them  To cut half of it out  And  It would be  At best  A diabetic  But miraculously  Mine  They  Kept doing ultrasounds  And mine came back down  And that was  A large reason  Of me getting sober 
[02:09:00]  Not  Staying sober  I suppose  Was that  Miraculously  I survived  Really  Kind of unscathed  Wow  Yeah  What year was that?  That was 94  So ever since?  Yeah  That's great  And you were  I mean how old were you  In 90  You weren't that old?  No 30  30 years old  30 yeah  And that's the reason  Why you don't drink anymore  I mean you got that  They basically said  If you start drinking again  There's no way  You'd make it right? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah you're done  Oh my god  Yeah so you know  I was in the hospital  For I think  10 or 11 days  And they said  Okay we have a  We have a rehab  Place for you to go to  And I saw some things  In the hospital  Not to sound corny at all  But you know  Really I saw myself  From above the bed  And I saw some pretty  Heavy things in there  And by the time  The 11 days was over  I was done  You know  They had weaned me off of  They had Librium in one arm  Which is for the DTs  And they had Morphine 
[02:10:00]  In the other arm  So it was kind of a gentle  Come down through the DTs  And everything  And so by the time  The 11 days was up  I was good  And I said  I'm done  They said  Well if you have a drink  Today  You know  You could die in an hour  You know  Or today  Or this week  You know  But you  You know  You'll be dead  And I said  Okay  Point well taken  Some incentive  Yeah  So cool  But hey  I'm here 
[02:10:30]  Because  What else you want to ask  Come on  Bring it on  One more  And then we'll try to  Lighten it up a little bit  But I'm a huge  Kurt Cobain fan  And weren't you  With him pretty much  Right near the end there  I was on a  Plane flight  I live  I'm from Seattle  I bought a home  Back there in  92  And I was going from L.A.  Back up to Seattle  And I was  I was still drinking  So it was pre-90  It was pre  You know  And yeah 
[02:11:00]  Kurt was on  The plane  It was Alaska Airlines flight  I think  Or United Airlines flight  And  He had said  He just left  From this rehab  Place down there  And I understood  We were in the same boat  You know  A couple  Kindred  You know  Dudes  And  I think I even  Lost a shoe  On that flight  Somehow I came on  With one shoe  I don't mean to laugh  Yeah 
[02:11:30]  Sorry  But it's funny  It is I guess  Right  And I think the shoe  Actually even  Converse made us  These shoes  And had our names on it  Like on the back  Somewhere  Someone has a cool  Shoe right now  Yeah  I just got home  And I  You know  I had one shoe  That said  Duff on the back of it  Fucking retarded  You lose your shoe  But that  You're not realizing  Until you get home  Where'd it go  But yeah  We got  We got to Seattle  And he was just  Going to go to home  By himself  A friend of mine 
[02:12:00]  Good buddy of mine  Was picking me up  At the airport  And we were  All down at  Baggage claim  Kurt myself  And my friend  Eddie  Kurt was going to go  Out and have a smoke  And I said  Eddie  Why don't you go out  I think Kurt  Had just got his bag  And he was waiting  For a car to pick him up  I said  Why don't you  Have him come over  To our house  You know my house  And we'll hang out  He seems pretty down  He just left  You know rehabbing  I mean  Obviously I didn't have  Any foresight  What was going to happen 
[02:12:30]  Sure  The next day  But you knew  He was in a bad place  Bad place  And Eddie came back in  And said  Oh man  The car just picked him up  And then  I think it was the next day  That I got a phone call  Or two days later  So  Yeah  That was kind of heavy  You know  But there was  I gotta say  There was a lot of guys  That were in our boat  Then  There was a lot of  Drug use  And a lot of  Us did not survive  We just did this tour  With Alice in Chains  Back in September 
[02:13:00]  In fall  Or summer and fall  Sorry  And it was amazing  Playing  Those are my brothers  You know  And Jerry and I  Used to  You know  Go pretty hard together  And Slash  And I  And Sean  And we had  We were the survivors  And we had  AA meetings  At these gigs  It was four of us  And we're looking at each other  Like wow  We're the guys  Who are still alive  Wow  Yeah  Lane Staley  Had an amazing voice  Oh my god 
[02:13:30]  I never got to see  Alice in Chains live  And he's a  He was a funny fucker  Was he?

[02:14:00]  Lane Staley  Yeah  And I mean  Not to be morbid  But he was  He was dead for a while  Before they  You know  Because he shut out  People that much  Yeah  Yeah  That's sort of a  Sensitive subject  No worries  Yeah  So  Yeah  No worries  Yeah  How much do you love  Motorhead?

[02:16:00]  Yeah  Lou Reed  He'd scare me  Have you guys interviewed him  No  No  I hear he's a tough interview  Yeah I could only imagine  Yeah  Sitting there  Little  Little hip  Little too hip for me  You know  One of the nicest guys  I've met  And he tells stories  For hours  Robert Plant  Really  And he comes  His son  He has two sons  That both  They have bands  And they've  Both opened for  Velvet Revolver  In the UK  You know

[02:17:00]  Hits the guy with the head  With the shoe  Something Heather Mills sang  God I was there  When that was all  Going on  Over in the UK  That was  What the Heather Mills  Man over there  They're brutal  They're just  The press is brutal  Robert Plant  Just had a million  Great stories  How old are  His sons?  Early 20s  Early 20s  I didn't even know  When he's talking though 
[02:17:30]  Can you even concentrate  Or like every time  His mouth moves  All you think is  That's Robert Plant  That's Robert Plant  That's Robert Plant  But he  He pulls you  Into these stories  And yeah  That's definitely  In the back of your head  The whole time  But these stories  Are so great  And amazing  You know  You're just kind of  Caught up in what  He's talking about  Really great  You know  There was a night  In the UK  In March  Our last tour there  And we didn't know  If we were going to  Have a singer  One night  And Robert Plant 
[02:18:00]  Was like  You know  Let me know  Let's play blues  For two hours  Get the fuck out  You were hoping  That you didn't have  You were a singer  That night  Locked Weiland's door  And threw away the key  Yeah  Is Eastside Dave here?  No  Not yet  We got  This guy lives  For Guns N' Roses  He's like  Speeding right now  To try to get to  The station  Where's he coming from?  Say goodbye to Duff  I don't know  Oh Brooklyn right?  Yeah  How can he not  Get it from Brooklyn?  I don't know  What an idiot  Give him ass  Hey  You know 
[02:18:30]  You know  Bill Kaye from Philly  He's gonna  He's setting me up  To fail miserably here  But did you know  That some people say  That Stairway to Heaven  The riff was ripped off  From that Spirit song?  I've never heard this  I've never heard that either  You got it?  Let's hear the Spirit song  Alright  Well just the beginning of it  Now  It was said back in the day  Before Stairway to Heaven  Was written  That Led Zeppelin  Was touring with Spirit  Okay  And Spirit had a song  Called Taurus  That none of us know  From 1968 
[02:19:00]  Shouldn't we get  In the little  Of the Zeppelin first?  Did you just happen to have  Did you just happen to have  That there?  Well this is something  That we've been having fun with  Like just  Oh okay  We call it rip-offs  Or coincidences  In music  Alright  And the big one  Was this Spirit song  Taurus  And some people think  Stairway to Heaven  You know  Kind of ripped off this riff  Everyone in Spirit  Everyone in Spirit  Certainly thinks that  So this is Taurus  From 1968  Just a quick clip 
[02:19:30]  Cool  Whoa  Close  Wow 
[02:20:00]  A little something there  And they toured together  That's how the story goes  I don't know  But in 1968  Spirit had that song out there  Yeah they definitely  Stole that  I mean you know  That's  The accompaniment  Is generally not copyrightable  But they done  Ripped that off  But they ripped off  I mean the Led Zeppelin  As was the style  Then a lot of the blues songs  The first couple records  Arranged by Led Zeppelin 
[02:20:30]  And they take all the publishing  You know  I mean that's just  Part of the deal  Ripping off the black man  And his blues  Which is why we all enjoy Zeppelin  But let's be honest  Sabbath  Was the band  Tough  Please don't agree  Please don't agree  We have to agree  Yeah there was two  I remember  In the 70s  I was still  You know  Like 12 and 13  But there definitely  Was two camps  There was  Like the Zeppelin camp  And the Sabbath camp  And then  Sabbath camp  Was usually the guys  But people like  From out in the suburbs  You know 
[02:21:00]  And you know  Zeppelin was a city band  I don't know why that was  People in the city  Like stealing riffs  Maybe that  Is that what it is  Not that I don't like Zeppelin  I like Zeppelin  But I've been defending  Sabbath for  Forever  24 years  Yeah I mean  I love Sabbath  But I love  Zeppelin too  And yeah  Punk rock came around  You know  When I turned about 13  So that's the direction  I went out  I mean if you want to know  Where Pearl Jam  All those bands came from  Where you just take 
[02:21:30]  Equal parts  Zeppelin  Sabbath  ACDC  Pistols  And like Circle Jerks  Boom  You mix that all together  And that's  You know  Put a bunch of kids  And a bunch of Schmidt  You guys don't have  Schmidt beer out here  But you know  Cases of Schmidt beer  In somebody's basement  And you mix that all together  And it  We used to have Schmidt beer  You get grunge  Animal beer  Animal beer  Yeah  Got the  All right  I forgot about  Animal beer  Animal beer  Yeah  So Duff  Who do you like better  Sebastian Bach  Or Josh Todd  From Buck Cherry  Who do I like better  What as a singer 
[02:22:00]  Or like who's cuter  Yeah  Who's got a better ass  Which one are you talking about  Well those are the  You know  The rumored  Candidates for  Oh no  Neither  Neither one of those two  Neither  No no no  All right  We got something from you today  Especially Josh Todd  Has been rumored to be  But he's not  His band's doing great  Yeah  Yeah Buck Cherry is all right man  They're doing great  No no Josh  No  Or Sebastian  Let's make a little headline today  What do you say  Just give us the guy you're thinking of  Robert Platt 
[02:22:30]  A New York guy  I just don't have it  Who the hell is  Well  The guy that  Come on Dave  My lips are sealed  I will  I will promote  Nutsy.com  Have you ever seen  Duff Kickbox  Oh really  Do you kickbox  I wouldn't even get close  Because I walk out of here  And he'd take my head off  At the neck  It would be over  But just imagine the plugs  For Nutsy.com  Do you like the UFC  It's fun to watch  Yeah  Does your new lead singer like it 
[02:23:00]  I'm not sure  Oh is that a hit  Now  Saying that the guy  Is from  It lives  I didn't say he's from New York  He's living here now  Yeah  Okay  What do you think of Stephen Carr  Possibly fronting  Stephen Carr  Stephen Carr was in a great band  Foundry  Foundry  They had a hit song  Pendulum  Hey Duff  Okay  You guys are too close  Now he's producing our show  It's not Stephen Carr  But you're so close  I'm going to tell you who it is 
[02:23:30]  Stephen Colbert  Ah  He's good  Stephen Carr  I don't even know who that is  Exactly  This is very happy  Can you listen to this song  Pendulum  Just the first  Right up to the hook  And I want your expert opinion  On this song  Okay  Here it is  We won't play the whole thing  Don't worry  Just to the hook  Yeah  And Dave  I want you guys to be honest  That guy's got the job 
[02:24:00]  I think it's Steve  The hook's coming  I'm sticking with it  Yeah  There you come 
[02:24:30]  Oh here's finally the horn  All right  Your honest opinion  Who isn't thinking that 
[02:25:00]  You go first  Is this one of your guys band  No  How about this  No one in studio  No one in studio  It's been submitted  It's been submitted  And the fans have given  Different reactions  Yeah  So  We want an honest opinion  From a guy who's obviously  Who knows  You're not going to hurt  Anybody's feelings  I just know what I like  And that's not really up my alley  Okay  That's one way to put it  What's the main problem with that  The singer 
[02:25:30]  I don't know if there's any problems  Come on  Aside from the fact that  You're among friends here  Don't worry  Aside from the fact that  It's no one in studio  I promise  But he's waiting outside there  With a baseball bat  It's god awful isn't it  You know  What do I say  You know  If somebody  If that's what they're doing  And they believe him to do  Then that's cool  I'm not going to  The consummate diplomat  I love the guy  That refuses to trash somebody  But it's so obvious  He is  It's music  It's not my 
[02:26:00]  It's not my cup of tea  That's all  Dave I think  You'll be a little more honest  I think it would be  Duff's cup of tea  If it were  It lacks  There's kind of a thing  When you watch someone  Who's a professional  Or listen to them  Whether they're a comic  Or whether they're a DJ  Or whether they're a musician  Or an actor  They're like the people  Who are really doing it  And the people  Who are trying to do it  And it's like  What Justice said  That about pornography  I can't define it  But I know it when I see it  Right  So to me  Those guys sound like  They're pretending to do it  That's all  I mean  It just doesn't 
[02:26:30]  Get out of my way  I'm not  It's not touching me  In my heart  And that usually means  That  You know Dave and I  We got into town  Last night  About 1 in the morning  Or 1.30 or something  And we came through  The Lincoln Tunnel  And came right out  Down there  By the Port Authority  Bus station  And there's a guy  Dave looks around  And he goes  Yep  We're in New York  Some guy was taking a shit  On the street  That guy was feeling it  The guy taking a shit  On the street  He meant it  Yeah  I don't know  It doesn't matter  How light or heavy  What you're playing is  There are people who like 
[02:27:00]  You just watch me  And you're like  Yep  That's it  That's the real thing  And that wasn't  Not for me  A real singer  Who I've just got  You know  I'm a little late  Getting into it  But Corey  From Slipknot  Holy shit  That guy  I saw his band  Last year  Amazing  Stone Sour  And  Right?  Stone Sour?  Corey's band  But that  That Slipknot  Volume 3 record 
[02:27:30]  You guys ever listen to that?  Slipknot?  Sounds like a ripoff  Of Sabbath Volume 4  Just saying  It all comes back  To Sabbath for you  Thank you  For noticing that  Yeah  Yeah what else guys?  That's about it  You got any other  Questions for me?  No I think we covered  Just about everything man  I'm so glad  We got that  Foundry thing  Out of the way  You're really cool  I didn't mean to go down  That Lane Staley road  Like that  You know  Oh you know  It was just a real bummer  As a fan  When you know  That all happened  Yeah and I'm  I'm really close friends 
[02:28:00]  With Jerry and Sean  And all those guys  Tell Jerry to do our show  He hasn't done our show  In years  Really?  Yeah we love the guy  Yeah he's hilarious  Very interesting  Yeah he is  He's a great guy  I mean that guy  Can write  I think Alice in Chains  Probably the best songwriting band  In rock in the last 30 years  And who's the new lead singer  I don't know his name  William  William  He's great  He's awesome  He sounds just like Lane  When you close your eyes  He's a great front man too  Yeah  Really good 
[02:28:30]  You gotta close your eyes  Cause he's black  So you know  Well you know  I think  I think  Even that  I mean  Is part  Of the genius  You know  It's just  He doesn't look like Lane  He's not trying to be Lane  He's William  He's his own guy  He's out  This summer  Singing with MC5  In Europe  Which is killer  And that's a great nod  And William is  Is from the same school  As me  Punk rock school  And he's  You know  Guy really means it 
[02:29:00]  Wears his heart on his sleeve  And he's a true artist  And perfect for that band  I've heard some of their new  The songs they've been writing  And they're gonna put out  A new record  And they have this one song  Called  Hollywood or Los Angeles  Or something  But it's  One of the best songs I've heard  Really  In a long long time  Cool  We look forward to it  Yeah  Duff  This was a pleasure  We were stolen  Cause we're hoping  Eastside Dave  He's  He's just a huge fan 
[02:29:30]  But  Eh fuck him  Yeah yeah  Fuck that guy  I mean you guys got things to do  And Dave  It's a pleasure meeting you as well  Good to meet you guys  Thanks for having us on  Well we got a moment here  Look at Dave  Eastside Dave  Come on  This is the real deal too  This is not a joke  Wait  Eastside Dave  I got a joke for you  Don't get all weird on us  Eastside Dave  I'm not trying to  But you are my favorite  Fucking bass player  Ever  I love Guns N' Roses so much  I love your fucking  You have my favorite song  What is that  Axl Rose renamed it  Get in the ring  But Duff here

Let me set the stage here  We need to start showing mid-conversation  That's how we do our shows  We got Jim Jeffries  Hello  And for the first time, I believe  Joe DeRosa  Yes, first time  We've been trying to make this happen for years  And I would see Joe in clubs like  No, we're going to get Johnson 
[03:01:30]  And then another year would go by  I'm just an awful person  No, I'm happy to finally be here  Thanks for having me  I appreciate it  It's a little more tame in here than I expected  I thought there was going to be like hookers blowing people  And interns taking shits on each other  That's only on the Saturday night shows  Yeah  I like it though  We're in the calling it in stage of our career  So  Call it in  Well, last time I was here, someone ate shit, didn't I?  Wow  That was Eastside Dave  Eastside Dave  Yeah, he defended himself by putting his hand up his ass 
[03:02:00]  And he got in trouble for that  Did he?  No, no  See, that's the problem  That wasn't the time  Dave did that  And there was no problems whatsoever  He does it again about six months later  And then gets in trouble  And then there's trouble  What did you get, Jimmy?  What is it?  Is that the chocolates finally?  Comesies?  No, I wish  I would be all gone already  Thank you very much  She sent me this  I think her name is Rosalie  Sent me chocolates  You guys are welcome  I'm only going to eat like one  I don't eat listeners stuff 
[03:02:30]  Why not?  Except they're pussies  They're good chocolates  I'll say they are  They're fucking brilliant  No, listen  These are very good  Before it passes  These guys were arguing Indiana Jones  Yeah, yeah  Big Indiana Jones fans  Joe DeRosa loved it  Got the DVD  I saw it six times  I think it ripped my childhood  Wow, the last one?  You saw it six times?  I saw it six times in the theater 
[03:03:00]  I mean, it just made me  Feel like a kid again  And people  Why, was someone touching you  In the theater?  Exactly  Hey, reach for the popcorn  I cut a hole in the bottom  People's shit on the movie  I was talking to Roland about it  Roland hated it  Jim Jefferies hated it  You didn't like it, Ant  I just  I thought it was good  Roland played the big Rolling Stone  In the first one  I thought it was good  It just made me feel like a kid again  You know, I felt like I was eight years old  I will admit you 
[03:03:30]  When you hear that music and shit  I love the music  And it's something new  And you're like, wow  I haven't seen this  You know, when you hear this  It's like, I've been watching these movies for years  Over and over again  And it's like, okay, it's new  And you really expect a lot of these fucking movies  Well, this should have been good  It should have been fucking good  They had all the time in the world to make the thing  Yeah, well, they certainly did  Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, 20 fucking years  I want something good  It was good, though  It was rubbish  He swung around on his fucking whip  No, when?  People shot machine guns at him 
[03:04:00]  There was animals and shit that he was fighting  What else do you want, man?  And the Russians ain't that bad  They're not as bad as Nazis  They're not Nazis  You can't beat the Nazis  When it comes to bad guys in movies  Indiana Jones and Nazis  Do another Nazi one  You get it  He's 80  Give him a time machine  They work in buddies  They work in aliens  The least I can do is get him a time machine  He goes into that fucking warehouse with all those boxes  Starts prying shit until he finds a DeLorean  He gets it at 88 miles an hour  The motherfucker's backfighting Nazis 
[03:04:30]  I like it  Better than that fucking piece of shit they put out  And you said you didn't like the CGI, right?  There was too much CGI in it  This is what I was saying before  When he used to be chased by the boulder  Or when he was jumping off something  Or swinging for something before  There was actual fear that Harrison Ford could get injured  Like these were proper stunts  And now it's like he's running upstairs  And there's two big massive CGI cogs  Crushing the stairs  That stupid Marion woman 
[03:05:00]  Who hasn't had a job in 20 years  Just grinning through the whole film  Just like, I'm working!  I'm working!  The doctor said I never would  But look at me now!  This is my point  This is my point that I was trying to make earlier, Jim  You have a different suspension of disbelief  Now that you're 33  Versus when you were 8  31  Versus when you were 8 years old  And, you know, when I was 8  A lot of things entertained me more easily  I used to turn my fucking penis inside out  In a bathtub for 20 or 30 minutes straight  When I was 8 years old 
[03:05:30]  And now do you use CGI for that?  Or what happens there?  It's still the same trick as an adult  I'm just saying  It's, you know  You drift away a little easier when you're a kid  You know, you got a point that  I remember watching the extras on the DVD of the old ones  And not even extras  I think like a TV show would be a special on  Behind the scenes before the DVD  And they'd show the guy in the little trench under the truck  Pulling himself with a whip  Right  And it's supposed to be indie, you know  But it's a stuntman and shit 
[03:06:00]  But they really did the stunt  And then Harrison Ford is there with the glass in front of him  And the cobra  Yeah, yeah  The cobra  And he spat the poison under the glass  And I had to start again  Yeah, yeah  You were going  How awesome were the ants?  They weren't ants  And then you were using the argument  You're going  But how can you control ants?  How can you control fucking cobras?  But because the cobras were in a room  The ants were in a jungle  How do you control ants in a goddamn jungle scene?  You're going to direct ants?  You collect ants up  Like in boxes and whatnot 
[03:06:30]  They've got all the bugs  I want to hear how you do this  They've got all the bugs  You've never been to Australia  There's fucking box  There's ant farms  Where you can just  You can go and get ants  You can buy them  People have ants  People have them in that little glass thing  Where they're all walking along  I will say this  In defense of your guys' argument against me  I liked the Star Wars prequels  So that might diffuse everything we're arguing about  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh my god  You might as well say it  Wow, they're telling us  They're telling us  Yeah, we're out of the go  Yeah  Your first appearance on the show 
[03:07:00]  And you've come on to tell us  About the Phantom Menace  That was a great five minutes  Wow  Wow, really?  Yeah, I liked them  I thought Indiana Jones was worse  Than the new Star Wars'  I thought the new Star Wars'  Was better than the new Indiana Jones'  You just said you liked them  I'm just sticking up for you  You thought that it was worse  Than the Star Wars prequels?  I thought the Indiana Jones  Was worse than the Star Wars prequels  I thought it was that bad  Hated first Star Wars prequel  Right  Didn't mind the other ones  Didn't fucking like 
[03:07:30]  Completely want to just  Rip Lucas' head off  Yeah, Revenge of the Sith was alright  Like, yeah, yeah  That was alright  The first one was a kid's fucking show  It was a fucking kid's movie  Right  Oh, look, I'm flying  And fucking  George Lucas stinks  Yeah, George Lucas  Terrible  The fucking little Ewoks  And I'll tell you  How many dwarves do you reckon  George Lucas does?  Oh, my God  He's the biggest dwarf  Employer ever  He's got to know hundreds, don't he?  He's got to know hundreds of dwarves 
[03:08:00]  As long as George Lucas is on this planet  Dwarves will never go hungry  Oh, they'll CGI the shit out of him  Now, though  R2-D2 was a fucking CGI  R2-D2 for a while  And how the fuck did R2-D2 go from  Because all the prequels were pre  He went from fucking this cool-ass  Flying motherfucking thing  With all kinds of gadgetry  To this piece of shit  Roly-poly  Falls  He can't even go over  I've got an answer for that  I've got an answer for that  Have you ever had a really nice car  You kept for 20 years?  Oh, it's a piece of shit  And then by the end  It's a piece of shit 
[03:08:30]  You know  The heater doesn't work anymore  They didn't keep up on his flying thing  His maintenance was rubbish  Okay  Alright, that I can accept  That kind of makes sense  And I've got to say that  The ships that they use  Fucking models  In most cases  Right  Look better than CGI these days  Yeah, models are always better  Because you can touch them on  Or you can see them on  Yoda was better as a puppet  The model I didn't think looked good  Was the fucking  Like the Death Star model  At the end of the first Star Wars 
[03:09:00]  With the fucking  Where they're just throwing M-80s  Onto the surface  Of some shitty thing  With the camera  That didn't look that good  But other shit looked really good  And Alien  The ship in Alien looked good  Because it was all dark  And everything  When they showed that  But that was all models  CGI ships are kind of  I don't know  But it's  I'm a little more forgiving  With CGI  Because if you look at model  You know  What they  The way model effects  Worked in the 50s  And the 60s  It looked tremendously 
[03:09:30]  More shitty  Than it did in the 80s  So CGI now  Looks pretty good  Compared to  When it did  In 95 or whatever  So it's like  It will get to  Jurassic Park  That was the best CGI ever  Jurassic Park  Jurassic Park was really  Fucking good CGI  That was the best CGI  And everything since then  And Gollum  And everything else is fucked  Yeah, what the fuck happened?  Yeah, yeah  Jurassic Park was  Like 20 years ago  Maybe it doesn't look as good  If we saw Jurassic Park today  No, no  I've watched it recently  Those velociraptors  Look fucking really cool  Hey, Chrisco from  Whackbag writes  I bet the Rose's 
[03:10:00]  Favorite Back to the Future movie  Is the third one  Is that true?  I hate the third one  So much  Third one's just  And I do agree  That Phantom Menace  Is the worst Star Wars film  Yeah  But it is  You know what made me  Kind of be forgiving with that?  My 8 year old nephew  Was like  I love Phantom Menace  I love it  And I was like  Alright, it's a kid's movie  This kid likes it  It's the best fuck scene  By a mile  That Darth Maul fight scene  Hands down  Is the best fight scene  In all the films  Can we talk about  How much Back to the Future 3  Sucks ass  Really quick?  It's so fucking bad  Like what?  Have we just become 
[03:10:30]  Nerds really fucking  I hated the fact  Yes, we did  I hated the fact that  At the end of 2  They showed you scenes  From 3  And like  It's the old west  When the hell did this happen?  When the hell did this happen?  Yeah  And it's like  What the fuck?  Oh, now we're gonna get a western  It's like  How many times  You gotta do that scene  Where he wakes up in the dark  He's like  Oh, I had a terrible nightmare  Oh, we're right here  On the good old 27th floor  Yeah  That's like  Watch out for old Tex Tannen 
[03:11:00]  Mom  Old Tex  Mad Dog Tannen  Oh, God  It sucked  It was like a made for TV  That movie was like  When they did  Facts of Life  Go to Europe  And you're like  Oh  Let it go  Yeah  And now already  It was bad enough  The over the top  Griff  Griff Tannen  McFly  That's why I told you  Never to come here  It's like  Alright  We get it  He's way over the top  Hunter boards  Don't work on water  McFly  Yes, you are power 
[03:11:30]  It was horrible  Yeah  The third one  Did not appreciate  The third one  And the love interest  With Doc ruined it  No fucking love interest  Well, you're supposed to believe  Mary Steenburgen  Would fuck Christopher Lloyd  Looking more ridiculous  Than he looks in real life  He talks Ted Danson  It's all  Yeah  Like the first one  Was good  It had  It had like 
[03:12:00]  An edge to it  Not almost  It did  They were using language  In that  That was like  Fuck, you know  Yeah, I remember  I saw the first one  When I was about  I guess I was nine  And I was really  It upset me in the theater  Because I only knew  Michael J. Fox  Is the cool guy  From Facts of Life  Family Ties  Family Ties  And I was like  I'm gonna be  Cone was the cool guy  From the Facts of Life  I was like  I'm gonna see the guy  From Family Ties  In a movie  And he started cursing  And it upset me so much  As a nine year old  Yeah, when I was nine  Haven't you seen 
[03:12:30]  Teen Wolf yet?  No, Teen Wolf wasn't out yet  Teen Wolf was before  Of course I'm a little faggot  I'm sitting here saying  I like the Phantom Menace  Teen Wolf was before  Back to the Future  Yeah, it was  Yeah, I don't think  He would have done  Teen Wolf after  Back to the Future  No, Teen Wolf was  After Back to the Future  It was definitely before  I'd be willing to  Place a bet on it  Wow  I'm not sure  So I'm putting 20 in  I'm putting 20 in  I have $10 in my pocket  That's all I got  Alright  We got a $10 bet  What is that, like  £2.50?

[03:13:30]  If you guys want  I do have audio  Of Mary Steen  What's her name?  Mary Steenburgen  Talking shit about  How she hated  Number 2  But loves Number 3  Obviously because  She was in it  Oh, of course  She's gonna fucking  Say that  The only redeeming part  Of Number 3  Was when you thought  That Doc died at the end  And you're like  Wow, he died  To save Marty  That's awesome  And then he comes back  In the time trade  Oh, what do you do?  They're both 1985  Oh  But  Back to the Future  Is listed as him 
[03:14:00]  Having done it  First  In  85  Excuse me  Wait, first before what?  Teen Wolf  It says Back to the Future  Teen Wolf  Family Ties Vacation  Which I guess  Was a TV movie  He goes to Oxford  To  To live for Parkinson's medication  And fucking  Spill proof cups  I could have swore  Back to the Future 2  Was in 89  Right after  Casualties of war  So you're saying  I've lost his bet?

[03:15:00]  Is that an in-joke?  Asshole  He's implying that we're a bunch of fucking bitches  We're a bunch of heads right now  I always bring this up  But don't you think it was odd  That the McFlies  Would have Biff waxing the car  And helping him out at the end  And saying  We never would have met  If it wasn't for Biff  Trying to rape your mother  Like that would be someone  You wouldn't invite over  To wax your fucking car  Or do anything  You'd punch him  Every time you see him  It's like  Stay away from that guy  He tried to rape your mother 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, they keep him around  And it's like  Okay  I'll put another coat of wax on  And George really just got lucky  With that punch too  Like if I was Biff  I just would have fucked him up  The next day  Oh, I know, yeah  Why didn't he just fucking  Clock him the next day  I would have kicked the shit out of him  Biff was kind of a pussy  They don't count an almost rape  That guy's still invited over  For the holidays  He's scared of him  For the rest of his life  Shut the door, McFly  Yeah, if McFly  Would have just like  Started thinking about  Walking away and shutting the door  She would have just gotten  Fucking raped by Biff  That wasn't rape in the 
[03:16:00]  Racism  I'm in  Or call black guy spooks  Yeah, yeah  Hey, beat it, spook  That wasn't rape in the 50s, I guess  That was like nowadays  It's dating  I'm gonna marry you  Be my girl  Be my girl  When he's on the street  And he just starts grabbing her ass  And trying to lift her skirt  In town square in Hill Valley  There was a more innocent time, Danny 
[03:16:30]  The 50s must have been a good time for rights  There was an innocent time  What did we know  We didn't know rape was bad for you  Like cigarettes  How the fuck did he not see him  In the rear view mirror  In the fucking car  That was so stupid  He's talking on the walkie-talkie  He's like yelling  Uh, yeah  I'm talking  I'm trying to get this  Fucking sports on my act  Uh, yeah, no  I'm in the back seat  Of, uh, Biff's car  Yeah, Biff's driving it right now  And he doesn't hear me  We're in a tunnel  And everything  Yeah, oh wait 
[03:17:00]  Holy shit  I have this just  Uh, premonition  That he's gonna turn around  And look  Let me duck  Yeah  And he just looked  Okay, I'll back up  Yeah, duck  Holy shit  I'm trying to get this  Fucking thing  I knew it was  I was like  Come on already  And he probably wanted to duck down  But you know how shitty directors are  That probably  Could you cheat up  A little bit  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Cheat up a little bit  He won't see ya  Sitting full up in the back seat  Hey  Hey, I gotta get to Jim Jeffries  Because I didn't forget, my friend  What?  I got a text message from you  God, it has to be six to eight months ago 
[03:17:30]  You go, thanks a lot  My mom thinks I'm gay  Yeah, my mom thinks  I don't know if you  Like, about six months ago  When I was last on  Well, whenever it was  Me, Jim, and Patrice  Had a fairly, uh, heated debate  Over whether I'm gay  Because I snowball and felch  Right  You said yes  And you said possibly  Yeah, I, I  It went on for about ten minutes  It wasn't much of a debate  You were the only one that said, uh  No, no, Jim stuck up for me  Of course I did  Yeah, yeah  I've never felt  But I'm not above  Talking to a girl  Perhaps I would lick 
[03:18:00]  My own cum off  For  It does nothing for me  But the idea of it  Might turn me on  If it was dirty enough for her  We can't start this again  This will go off  No, no, I'm telling you  Have you licked your own cum off  Yeah, right  I've never done that  The reason why I can't say this  Is because what happened was  Someone puts a ten minute clip  Of a picture of me  In my underwear on YouTube  I've just  And it's called  Is Jim Jefferies Gay  On YouTube, right  And it's just  This isn't helping your cause  By the way  I don't watch  I don't  I don't  Google myself that much 
[03:18:30]  You know  My mum does it every day  Right  So she rings me up like this  And this is the opening sentence  It just goes like this  I think you're gay  And I'm going  What?  Mum?  What?  What?  It's like the middle of the night  I go  What are you talking about?  Licking semen out of people's bottoms  It's disgusting  Holy shit  She goes  She goes  You disgust me  You disgust me  Like this, right?  Wow  And then she goes  That's the clip there  That's an old publicity photo, right?  And she goes on and on and on 
[03:19:00]  About me  And she goes  What are the people down  The shop's going to think?  And I go  What are you fucking talking about?  What are they going to think?  So then I think everything's okay  I think everything's okay  My mum thinks I'm gay  She doesn't speak to me for a month  Everything's fine  I talk around  I say  It's all radio shit  I just make it up  Don't make it  I don't do any of these things, mum  And then  About a week after that  She sees  Remove your hat  And  Oh yeah  Oh, you were part of that  I forgot  I listened to that  I watch that sometimes  Oh my god, yeah 
[03:19:30]  Because the funny part  For watching  Remove your hat  Remove your hat  Is to watch Jeffries  Get caught up  In the wave of joy  Exactly  It's like the second time through  You're laughing and laughing  And then  The hysterical wave hits you  And you just  It reaches you  I know  I watch it back  I try to feel bad about it  I try  I try to watch it  I try to feel remorse  I do everything I can  And as soon as  That wheel's spinning  In this 
[03:20:00]  I'm over  And I've done bad things  I've gotten drunk at parties  And gone to people  Do you want to see  The funniest thing ever  And then showed it to them  And people just look at me  Like I'm sick  I think Joe  You'd be outraged  What is remove your hat  I don't know what it is  It's a 101 year old  Why do we put it on  Let me explain though  There's three or four  Different versions of that  On YouTube  But the funniest one is  Do we have the whole  With Jeffries  Because what happens  Is there's a very rude woman  I don't say  I don't say anything funny 
[03:20:30]  In the whole thing  How old is she  I'm just laughing  She's a hundred and one  Wait but hold on  But how does that  Turn into your mom  Still thinking your day  My mum watched it  She's decided to  Google some more stuff  And she just gets  More and more disappointed  With everything that I say  On this show  To the extent where  She doesn't want to  Talk to me anymore  She goes what  She goes what if  That was me being beaten up  And I went well mum  You're like 67  You'd put up more of a fight  And then I was like  Hang on  You've punched me more  Than that black guy  Punched that 101 year old woman  He wasn't punching her  What defense do you have  She was rude  He was  That's called a lesson 
[03:21:00]  In manners  That she won't soon forget  It's called tough medicine  She was wearing a hat  His fist was a spoonful  Of sugar  It's every time you say  She's late on her hat payments  I'm fucking pissed with her  That's the funniest thing  That anyone's ever said  Late on her hat payments  Joe doesn't know the video  Danny's pulling up  Okay  So I can watch this thing  Do you want us to  Google bomb  Jim Jefferies is gay  If you want to listen to it 
[03:21:30]  It's  Alright here  Can we put it up  On the big screen  Or no  Nah  They're fixing it  But someone  Pieces together  Is there volume  Someone went through  All the footage  To know where we were talking  Oh there's the  Place for our country  Over the last  Frank  Let's see what I'm gonna get  Oh  Look at the walker wheels  Look at the wheels  That was teacher  That was fucking  Frank Vincent Wiggler 
[03:22:00]  That was teacher  Look at that  Oh there it goes  This tape is called  This tape is called  Rich Vosch  Trying to get paid a governor  You're 100% sure  This is real  This is in fact  Oh it's absolutely real  The guy got arrested  This is everything  Watch your hair fluff out  Watch your hair fluff out  Watch your hair fluff out  Watch your hair  You're insane  Why the fuck that  It's so funny 
[03:22:30]  Your hair  Puts it  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  He  The club  You guys are wrong  I love the hair fluff  Watch the hair  Oh the hair  Is great  He  He  He  He  He  He  Keep playing it  Over and over again  I'm like  Your laugh is killing me  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:23:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  I have a feeling  Payments are late  There's the line  Holy shit  So Joe what do you think  It was  It was hilarious  I feel terrible for laughing at it  It was hilarious  But it was  What was making me laugh  Was  Was Jeffrey's going  And every time you hear that laugh  It would coincide right with her 
[03:23:30]  Getting that fucking right shot  To the  To the fucking ear  It wasn't just a guy laughing  It was the clip  It reached Jim  It was like  It was like  It got him in the soul  Of being funny  Holy shit  It's called  Remove Your Hat on YouTube  It's still the funniest thing on earth  Yeah  And I said  I do feel bad  Of course  But I do watch it to cheer myself up  Exactly  I hate the fact that the camera  Doesn't catch her on the ground  Show a fucking clumsy old bitch  Had to fall out of frame  That's what made it  Bad directing  That is  The wheel spinning in frame 
[03:24:00]  That makes it so funny  If they  If the picture was clearer  It wouldn't be as funny  The fact that it was all gray  And like a horrible silent movie  The clip  The clip  Jim's right  The clip does scream  Jim Jeffries  Because  That is the kind of thing  You'd laugh at  And you're  You're just game for anything  That's what I like  Remember when we got  Shit faced  After we did  Down and Dirty  Yeah  With Jim  You can tell everyone  And you went to that fucking  I took  Jim's like  I'm fucking horny  I gotta fucking go to  Jack Shack  He wanted to whack off somewhere 
[03:24:30]  So I brought him up  Into this fucking place  On 42nd street  And he's shit faced  And he's just  There's one fat stripper  Working  At two in the morning  And he's shit faced  And I'm bartering  The fucking deal  Because he's so drunk  He can't  Understand his  Cockney  Whatever fucking  Part of England he's from  And he's going  The girl's going  So for $30  He can come in here  And play with himself  And he's going  Can I have a wank  Can I have a wank  And I go  Yeah you can have a wank  Go in  And he's going 
[03:25:00]  Can I have a wank  Right in there  And he's like in disbelief  I go yeah you can have a wank  I couldn't believe it  It was like a public place  Yeah I finally  I snapped  He's like  But the fifth time  Can I have a wank  I'm like yeah  You can fucking jerk off in there  Go and fucking play with yourself  In that closet  And the cool thing was  All the comics  Waited out in front of the door  For me to do it  And then we all had McDonald's  Like nothing happened  Hey let's  How did you guys have so much fun  After the shoot  I did nothing after the fucking shoot 
[03:25:30]  We just went to Manhattan  We got in the car  God damn it  I came up to get you  And say thank you  And be like hey  We're all going to go out  If you want to go  But you were like  In the room with Lemmy  And it was  I was like he's going to be in there  For hours  Yeah  That was so funny  That shoot  Because American TV  Is different to British TV  British TV  They try to get your shit face  So that you're like  You're all loose on stage  And I'm like  I go up to like  One of the producers  On the show  And I go  Can I have a beer  And they looked at me  Like I should be in an AA program  And they go  What you're about to be on television

[03:28:00]  There you go  A cock and a  Back on the same page  A cock and a cunt  I don't like that  That's no good  Exactly  Make a decision guy  Yeah make a decision  Don't make someone choose  These two delicious options  I don't know whether to kiss you  Or punch you  I'm not like into  Asian bitches  But they do seem to make  The best trannies  Well it depends on  What you're looking for  Ant  I would say the Spanish  I don't like oriental boots  They seem to make  The most realistic looking girls  Out of a guy  But  Even the guys  I'm not even into  Chick fucking Asian girls 
[03:28:30]  Asians and blondes  Because  The less hairy  They were  Beforehand  That usually is a good thing  Less hair  More good  Nobody wants a Greek  Tranny  Knuckles like  Robles  I want you to fuck me  When I watch Kojo  I don't think I've ever seen  Is there ever been  An Arab tranny  Oh yes there has been  Yeah  Yeah I mean not that I know  Who travels to Dubai  But yeah  It's easy once you put  The burqa on  Just go look  I'm all changed  I'm a girl now 
[03:29:00]  I'm a girl now  How convincing is this  You're like oh look  Yeah  Check for the  Adam's eyes  It's funny  You know  That's how you know  If you're a tranny  When you're cutting  If you cut through  The Adam's apple  Lovely culture  What are  If I may ask  Yeah  ONA  What are your thoughts  On trannies  I know Jim's take  On all this stuff  But I don't know  So out  So out  It's not  Not sexual at all  It's a  Curiosity 
[03:29:30]  It's one of those things  Where  And not curious  To do anything  But if I see  Like pictures of a tranny  I have to look  And go  Okay  Yeah that one  Can't pass  No  That one  Alright  That one kind of passes  Like I just judge them  When you look  Very judgmental  You would look like  It's a freak show  Or something  Yeah  To get turned on by it  So you would get  You would get blown  By a tranny  Yeah I think so  Knowing that there's a cock  No no  No sex at all  This is when  I cross the barrier  There you go  There  There you go 
[03:30:00]  Actually  Oh  That's um  No I'm kidding  Absolutely  Yeah that's a  That's a difficult one  Wait wait wait  Explain Joe  Absolutely  I was gonna say  I definitely let her blow me  But when I realized  I crossed  The full on barrier  With trannies  Was when  I was  I started  Kind of looking at him  A little bit on the internet  And kind of whacking off to him  And stuff  And I was talking to my buddy  About it  And he goes  What buddy  I go  I go  Did you  I go dude  I kind of like trannies  I think a little bit

[03:31:00]  So I know  Like I think it's sexy  That I can't see her fuck  Wait the tranny  Was using  The cock  Or she was using  A strap on  The tranny  Has her own cock  Yeah  She doesn't have it anymore  She's post up now  But my friend's  You know  She's a girl  And she's uh  Was the girl  Strap on  Fucking the tranny  No I  From what I remember  The tranny was fucking her  So it was like perverse  But it was  It was  Okay see  That's okay to watch  I could watch that  Yeah  The girl is a guy  With tits  Fucking a chick  But part of it is  That's great too  The girl I know  Is such a pervert

[03:51:00]  Lennon  Lennon sucked  Lennon was alright  He was alright  Paul McCartney's  Over fucking rated  Wings had some good songs on it  Wings were alright  Lennon  McCartney was all about  Hits  Woman  Working class hero  Working class hero  Amazing  Imagine  Starting over  Jealous guy  Is a great song  Jealous guy  I like that stuff  Imagine  You're like working class hero  Imagine is  What a baby I am

[03:52:00]  You're an ugly dude  Fucking a hot chick  But if you're a decently dude  Fucking an ugly broad  They're like  This guy's got depth  He sees what somebody  Has really to offer  Overrated  As a solo artist  Lennon  Please  I disagree  I would love to say that  I think Wings was average  I don't think Paul McCartney  Was doing anything good  But as far as writing hits  That people bought  Fucking millions of records  McCartney had a way better career  Than Lennon did  But Lennon's stuff  It's like  We all shine on  It's a great tune  Imagine  Working class 
[03:52:30]  Yeah they really are  Your shine on  Is a fucking tremendous  It really is  He only had a decade  He only had a decade  I don't mind that song  Okay  You're right  He only had  Less than 10 years actually  Imagine  And you think of artists today  How much music they bring  Literally one of my least favorite songs  Of all time  It's up there with  Brown Eyed Girl  And Blister in the Sun  And  Lawyers in Love  Hey what's that fucking  How can you not love this song?  Imagine like that song  Did I tell you last time  My John Lennon story 
[03:53:00]  When I was out here  Did you ask him to sign something  In front of the Dakota  Straight after I came here  I walked off to the Dakota building  Because obviously I've never seen  A Beatles fan  So I go and stand there  There's that little step  That Mark Chapman sat on  For three hours  And waiting for John Lennon  To go out  And then he  Then he waited for him to sign it  Then he waited for John Lennon  To go away for three hours  He sat there for seven hours  Waiting for John Lennon  Right  I go down  I ask for him to take a picture  I sit on that step  And two security guys come up  And go  Get off the step  Get off the step  And I'm like  I'm just sitting here  And he goes  Get off the step 
[03:53:30]  And I went  Where the fuck were you  20 years ago  28 years ago anyway  You know what I mean  And they actually  That's really arsy on me  I'm like  Fucking brilliant  That's great  That album by the way  Is still  Is being auctioned or something  It has a little bit of  It's got DNA on it  Yeah it's got Lennon's blood on it  What album  The one he was carrying  The one he was carrying  It's the last autograph  And it's covered in Lennon's blood  Who's carrying it 
[03:54:00]  Chapman or Lennon  Chapman bought the album  He gets it autographed  And then Lennon goes off  For some interviews  And recording stuff  Comes back a few hours later  He's still sitting there  With the album  And then he shoots him  He didn't have the balls  To it the first time  There's actually a photo  Of Chapman and Lennon  Where he's actually  Signing the album  There's a photo of that  How?  Because there's  Pavarazzi waiting  At the front of the building  They're taking pictures  Of John Lennon  There's a picture  Of the two of them  How could that be  The last autograph  He ever signed  Are you going to tell me  When he went to do  Oh I don't know  It's okay  You know

That's the picture  He's dead three hours later  And there he is  And look at Chapman  Smiling his face  Like oh I'm  Meeting John Lennon  That's fucking great  Bag of shit  What album was it?  He should have been killed  Lennon  Double fantasy  Lennon was killed  I mean Chapman  Geez Jim  He should have been killed  Lennon  He should never get out  And he should be executed  To shoot a guy  So below him 
[03:55:00]  Where to guys  Who think  Yes  He should never sign  For guys with juicy  Livery lips  Well he was due for parole  About four or five years ago  He should just be shot in the head  Like a fucking roach  They'll never let him out  They'll never let him out  Never  Although they let fucking  What's his face  John Hinkley  Should never be able  To fucking go visit his family  He can visit  He can do things  Fuck him  He's like  I was crazy back then  He goes  Man are you kidding  I had that whole  Fucking thing going on  I was nuts  Fucking liberal  Jodie Foster and shit

[03:59:30]  At least they call  Yeah so everyone  Evaculates from the building  And they blow up the building  And go  Think what could have  Happened  It could have been  Terrible  But now you've just  Got to rebuild that  And that's  That's going to  Take some time up  Isn't it  And you're not  Going to want to do that  I saw a clip  Of a truck bombing  In England  And it was back  From when the IRA  Was doing their shenanigans  No this is in Manchester  Manchester was such a shithole  The IRA blew the fuck out of it  They rebuilt the place  It's fucking lovely now  Without the IRA  Manchester would still be 
[04:00:00]  A hunk of shit  A shithole  They had a truck bomb  And apparently enough time  To clear everyone the fuck out  Yeah  No one was there  And then it blew up  It blew up  In front of a building up  It blew up about  Four or five square blocks  Amazing  Jesus Christ  And now we've got  A big shopping centre  They built a lovely  Lovely walkway  With a little river  And stuff  It's fucking beautiful  The bit where the IRA  Blew up  Is the nicest bit  In Manchester  Everything around  Is still shit  I'm saying blow up 
[04:00:30]  The whole fucking thing  And start again  Who were they kneecapping  They were kneecapping  Where they put a gun  Behind your leg  And they blow out your knee  Don't look at me  I don't know  So the thing is  The IRA  You don't know her kneecapping  No  That's where they take the gun  In the crook of your leg  From the back  And they shoot  From the back  Through your fucking knee  How do you fix that  You gotta go to the doctor  It's a whole thing  You gotta hobble  Yeah  Oh it's a mess  You need orthopedic shoes  Yes  No shoes and pants 
[04:01:00]  Do you know how much it hurts  To fucking get your knee  Shot through on purpose  No  No I don't  If I really wanted to  Torture someone  I think that's what I'd do  Blow their kneecaps off  I've thought about this  Several times in my life  In movies  That's always a brutal thing  Like you watch people  Get shot in the head  Or the chest  And they fall down  And they're dead  And it's like  Alright  You know  The guy's killed  When you see someone  Get two  One in each kneecap  And they hit the ground  And go  Oh dude it's rough  Everyone goes like  Oh  It's rough  I think it was rough  We're all in the groin  They hit a dude  In the fucking knees  With a bat  Or some shit  No the groin's flesh 
[04:01:30]  Once it's blown off  It's blown off  Through bones and nerve  Yeah that's true  But I wouldn't want to  Get shot in the groin either  Because I never actually  Put my knee in a girl's face  And made goo  I could live without a knee  Yeah that part in Pulp Fiction  Where he shoots the guy in the dick  That's fucking brutal  And he's just on the ground  Oh god it's fucking horrible  That dude apparently  Has done a lot of shit  Peter Green  That's all I know him from  Is the guy that got shot in the dick  I can't even remember  Oh Zed  Occasionally Zed shows up  Brett shows up 
[04:02:00]  Who's Brett?  The kid that gets fucking shot  At the beginning of the movie  In the  Oh oh oh  Frank Whaley  Say what  Say what motherfucker  One more time  Yeah  Tremendous actor  I saw him actually  Recently in a party  For the Pacino De Niro  Right right  Yeah he was there  Frank Whaley was at the party  Yeah he saw a lot of them  Did you see that?  Also Pulp Fiction  Sam Jackson  Nash  The cop  The cop  Marvin Nash  Reservoir dog  Marvin Nash 
[04:02:30]  I've never seen that guy  Oh I've seen him pop up  In a few things  And I'm like  Who the fuck is that?  It's just  I'm racking my brain  And then  You know  Internet movie database  Takes away  Burr and I were watching  That one night  We were watching  I'm sorry  I didn't mean to  No it's cool  We were watching that one night  And we were  In my apartment  And we were just  Screaming that at each other  What the fuck  Are they waiting for?  Marvin Nash  It's like 2am  We're screaming that  In my fucking apartment  It was really funny  At the time  It was funny now 
[04:03:00]  It was good  Michael Manson  As a sociopath  In that  It's chilling  Because he fucking  Means it  Nothing you say  Is gonna stop him  From torturing you  With a fucking razor  It's just awful  That is the scariest  Most frightening line  I've ever heard in a movie  Is when  Literally  When he goes  You can say whatever you want  I'm gonna torture you anyway  I was like  That is so fucking scary  I don't give a fuck  What you know  Or don't know  I'm gonna torture you anyway  I'm gonna torture you anyway 
[04:03:30]  There's no bargaining  With him at that point  You can't like  Okay look  I understand what you just said  Now listen to me  Give me a chance  Now to communicate  To you  Yeah  You're so fucked  No there's nothing  There's nothing  It's like dealing  With a shitty ex-girlfriend  And she's just like  Nah nah nah  You know  You're like  I'm fucked  Another brilliant part  Of that whole scene  Was when he goes out  To the trunk  To get the gasoline  And you hear  The fucking music is playing  The sky's in agony  Blood  He fucking cut his ear off  And then he walks outside  And they follow him 
[04:04:00]  And the door shuts  And you hear the tweeting birds  And kids playing  And it's just quiet  Oh it's beautiful  It gives you this  Ah  And you hear the music  Yeah yeah  Ever so slightly  From in the warehouse  Tarantino  And Scorsese  Do it so well  But so few directors  Have realized  The importance of a soundtrack  In a movie  Yeah  And how much music  Really means  That's one of the things  That ruined that  De Niro Pacino movie  Their acting was good in it  And the script itself  Wasn't terrible  It was an alright script  Better than Indy 
[04:04:30]  Ah  Yeah yeah  Probably  Oh the script was really good  I wish you continued success  It wasn't  But this  Hold on  No no let me just  Make a point  I've read fucking  Better written things  Written by retarded children  Like when they're describing  A tree in the sun  They painted  Sorry  Let me just make a point  Say written one more time  Written written written written written  W-R-I-2-T-E-N  Fucking  Cut face  No improver  Spoil everything  The script was nothing spectacular 
[04:05:00]  But it wasn't a horrible script  But the movie was so poorly  Fucking directed  Yeah  There was needless effects  There was that shitty  First person thing  That they do  Where it's like  The killer is sneaking  Into the house  He's the same guy  He's at 88 minutes by the way  He's terrible  And the soundtrack  Sucked  Like he didn't  The way he used music  Was so fucking bad  And I'm like  I don't understand  Why directors don't  If you want to be a director  You're familiar with Scorsese  You're familiar with Tarantino  You're familiar with all these guys  How could you not know  How to put  Robert Rodriguez does it  Yeah  In like  Dust Till Dawn 
[04:05:30]  When him  Well that's Tarantino also  But fuck  Well Rodriguez directed it though  Yeah  The music though  Is really important  And shit like that  Yeah  Really  Makes the moment  Who did better than Clockwork Orange  With his classical music  To violence  Like a gang fight  To fucking classical music  It was all right to joy  Wasn't it  It was Corey  It was almost like a dance  It was so fucking brilliant  Yeah  I mean that was  Did you know they commissioned  The Rat Pack  Sinatra  They were supposed to do that movie 
[04:06:00]  In the very very early 60s  With the Rat Pack  Are you shitting me  I swear to god  The quote from Sinatra  They didn't do it  They said when Sinatra was asked  Why he passed in the film  He goes  I couldn't understand  A god damn word in the script  You can get this picture  I'm doing  I couldn't understand  All angry  They would have ruined  They offered it to Mick Jagger too  Before Malcolm  Really  That might have been alright  I think Mick Jagger's actually  Half decent sometimes  Maybe but Malcolm  I like you when he acts Mick Jagger  I like how Jimmy once said  I like Nick Kelly  Malcolm McDowell  Like he was  He was young in that 
[04:06:30]  And the day after that movie  He turned like 100 years old  He's fucking  He had white hair  In fucking like  December of 71  Him and Steve Martin  It's like what happened to him  He's one of those guys  That were  It's a blessing and a curse  To kind of look young  When you're not young  And then  You're all of a sudden  Overnight an old person  He's got  What's it called  He's got Dennis Hopper syndrome  He made one great fucking movie  Dennis Hopper topped out  An Easy Rider  And then it was  Hey Waterworld 
[04:07:00]  Caligula  Malcolm McDowell Caligula  Don't forget about  Super Mario Brothers  He's a great man  Dennis Hopper was in that  Rhea Perlman sitcom  After Cheers  And it was  That guy has been in  Like I mean  What the fuck happened man  No Malcolm McDowell was in that  That was Malcolm McDowell  Yeah Malcolm McDowell  Malcolm McDowell's done some  Shitty stuff too  Over the years  He did a movie called  If  In like 1969  And then he did  Fucking clockwork  And Caligula was great  Yeah but that was  Not really a mainstream movie 
[04:07:30]  What was the time movie  Back in time  Oh yeah yeah  Back to the future  Back to the future  He was in  Back to the future 3  Yeah  No the other one  Yeah he played  Buford Tannen  Oh oh  Bill and Ted's  Excellent Adventure  No that wasn't  I love  I love Bill and Ted's  Excellent Adventure  That's my second favorite  Time traveling movie  George Carling as Rufus  That's a great one  Bogus Journey sucks though  Oh yeah that sucks yeah  But that's  Speaking of that  That's what I always thought  Should have been  The plot of  Back to the future 3  They should have been  Jumping all over time 
[04:08:00]  To try to fix  The events of 2  Instead of saying  We're just gonna go back  To the old west  Oh and wrap up 2  You mean 3  2 shouldn't have been  Wrapped up  Well 2 wasn't  2 was left open ended  And he had to get back  To the west  To get out of the 50  Whatever the fuck happened  No but he had fixed  What like  Biff fucked up  With the sports almanac  He fixed that  Although getting rid of  The Biff Tannen Museum  Pisses me off  Because imagine going  To the Biff Tannen Museum  That would have been  Fantastic  Learning how Biff 
[04:08:30]  Made his fortune  Oh wait a minute  What  Do I  Do I hear it  I love that  God bless America  Biff Tannen  In the American Dream  I  I wanted to hear  The introduction  That everyone hears  When they enter  The Biff Tannen Museum  You fucker  You guys  That work with Tom Wilson  Yeah  Who's that  The guy who plays  Biff's a stand up  I didn't know  He's a good guy 
[04:09:00]  He is a stand up  He's not a bad  He does a song called  Stop asking me the questions  Which is no it's not  Memele  It's good YouTube  Really  Yeah he does a funny  Little song about  How old is he  Oh he's like fucking  He's like 40's now  At least  Right  But the thing is  He's a good guy  He'll drink with you  He's packed on the pounds a bit  But halfway through the night  I'm getting pissed with Biff  Right  And his name's Tom obviously  But you don't know that  When you're drunk  You're like  Oi Biff  You feel like the biggest cunt ever  You know what I mean  You're another cunt  As soon as I said it 
[04:09:30]  I went  I'm a fucking dick  I just called you Biff man  What did he do  He was just like  Alright  Yeah he's alright  Is he British  No no he's American  You tube him  Tom Wilson  And he has  It's like a two minute song  Of him going  Stop asking me the questions  He's a very interesting guy  He's a song guy  Is he really  Yeah he's a song guy  Who would have known  He uh  Dude he's so good in those movies  Like he's genuinely  A really funny dude  And a good actor  I'm like why did he not  What happened  Was he just that stereotype  So typecast as Biff  Hurts typecast 
[04:10:00]  At that point  You're just  You're Biff  Tom Wilson  He was uh  Was it that  He's got what here  Was it like playing Luke Skywalker  Like that kind of thing  Corvette Summer was even bigger  Than Star Wars  Where's the Biff Tannen Museum  Ladies and gentlemen  Welcome to the Biff Tannen Museum  Dedicated to Hill Valley's  Number one citizen  And America's greatest  Living folk hero  He built this himself  The one and only  Biff Tannen  Of course we've all  Heard the legend  But who is the man 
[04:10:30]  This is like when you end  In my house  It's just the same  Like Biff  Do you think Biff  Biff wrote this himself  Learn the amazing  History of the Tannen family  Starting with his  Great grandfather  Buford Mad Dog Tannen  Setting up for three  Fastest gun in the west  See Biff's humble beginnings  Humble  And how a trip to the  Race track  On his 21st birthday  Made him a millionaire  Overnight  Yeah  Made him a millionaire  Overnight  Where's the part  They didn't play it  Where's the part where  I love when he goes  God bless America  Yeah  And he gives her that  Fucking kiss  With all the tongue 
[04:11:00]  And he grabs her  And starts kissing her  Yeah  He's like raping her  Right after they get married  Marrying his high school  Sweetheart  She fucking had  Almost raping  His high school sweetheart  No means yes  You're in the 50s  Yeah he must have  Just been typecast  After that  I mean  Michael J. Fox  Had a career before that  So it wasn't like  You could do three movies  Oh yeah  And then  You know  Doc Brown  Had a career with Taxi  So  But he was just  Fucking Biff  Christopher Lloyd  And everything 
[04:11:30]  Is Doc Brown  Yeah  On Taxi  He was Doc Brown  Except he didn't have  A time machine  And he's drunk  Dark Brown  On Taxi  You can't interview him  Can you  He's like a really  Nervous bloke  He doesn't do  Interviews and stuff  Because he did one in Britain  He just sat there quietly  Yeah he's just like  He's a really  Unpersonable sort of guy  Is he well known in Britain  No  Well the movie  Is as big as it is  Everybody  Everyone knows that movie  They still show Taxi  On TV in Britain  So  That's a funny show right  It's a funny show  I like Taxi  Danny DeVito's best work 
[04:12:00]  By far  He played a good  Little weasley freak  Fucking throwing music  In on every fucking  How fast was that  How fast were they  With the Taxi song  Well Derek  Fucking on the board  Good night sir  You know I was watching  Mr. Belvedere  The other day  Yeah well  And I'm saying to myself  You know they don't  Make shows like this  They really don't  Like different strokes  Or the facts of life  Or Sanford and Son  Hurry up  Shit dick 
[04:12:30]  Super train  Was a great show  Jesus fucking  Very underrated  I have the same  Love boat  I know  Where stars were on  A train  Yeah and you can  Watch Rocky right after  What are we doing  Listening to Taxi  Guys  You're four hours behind you  I was watching  Airwolf the other day  Yes  Just give us the A team  We all want the A team  Everyone loves that  Play the A team already  Before I fucking fire you  And break your shitty watch  There it goes  That's great  How does it make you  Feel good this music  How they can fire  It's like the Indiana Jones music 
[04:13:00]  All those rounds of ammunition  And not ever kill one person  Exactly  They always had to show  The person crawling out  Of the rolled vehicle  Yeah  And then doing the  Oh darn it  Yeah  If you can find them  They can help you  Is there anything greater  Than George Pappard though  Don't you just want to be  On some kind of team  Or project  They hated it  He's dead  They did it  They did a TV show  Called Reuniting the A team  There's this guy  Justin Lee Collins  In Britain  Who's on TV  He has these good little shows  Where he comes out  And he just knocks  On people's houses 
[04:13:30]  And tries to get  Dallas back together  Or whatever  He tried to get  The A team back together  And he found Mr. T  Just jogging in a park  He found Face  Begging for money  And you know  Like Dirt Benedict  And they all said  The same thing  Pappard was a cunt  Really?  No  None of them liked him  Well Pappard was a fucking  He was like an actor  All three of them  Hated Pappard  His name is hard to say  Pappard  Pappard  Pappard  Mr. Pappard  He did have a career  In movies though  He was in Breakfast  In Tiffany's  Stupid fucking TV show 
[04:14:00]  That's a good point  With the guy from  Battlestar Galactica  That's probably  Of course he was a cunt  He was better than  Those people  It's probably how  Leslie Nielsen felt  On the set of Airplane  He's like  You know you fucking  Handjobs  I'm not here for  A fucking paycheck  I'm an actor  You're a real actor  Asshole  Sitting here with  William Shatner  Are we just gonna keep up  Doing this show  Until no one's left  Everyone's bailing out  Danny's holding up signs  That say we only have  Nine minutes left  Until the computer  Cuts us off  Jim we're the new hosts  Of the Opie and Anthony show

[04:38:00]  What a creep this guy was  We're getting somewhere  Well he was in his 60s  He was decent  He was respected  Decent  Respected by the church  You're insane  This guy was getting off  Look at you  Patty got got  There's no reason  For that guy  For that guy to be in there  Shaving while you're  In the bathtub  And he would try  To cover himself up  And then if I tried  To close the door  Nobody was allowed  To close doors  In that house  Let me ask you a question  Now 15 year old  Gooch  Full blown bush  By this time right 
[04:38:30]  Of course  So you're just sitting there  With your bush in the tub  I didn't have much of one  At that age  It was like a 50s bush  Oh I'm sure  So it was floating  At the top  Yeah  It looked like a little island  Like moss  And she was just sitting there  Swamp  And he told you to keep washing  Didn't he  He said keep washing  Don't stop washing  Oh you're just a little girl  Keep washing  Actually he didn't say anything  He said oh you're just  A little girl  Don't worry about it  He would wash his hands  Or whatever  Yeah he would wash 
[04:39:00]  His hands on your breast  Grab something off the table  And then just walk out  He would offer you  Some of his hand soap  Patty  Do you understand  That's inappropriate  Oh my god  Well I guess I do now  But at that time  It was different  But he would  He would go about his business  And shave and stuff  While you're naked  In the tub behind him  And I didn't like it  And I would complain  But you know  And you'd keep doing it  And there was no one  To complain to  This is 60s and 70s  Children were seen  And not heard  So if I complained  I wasn't heard  It was like  Oh shit 
[04:39:30]  We're getting to something today  After 10 years  She goes  I'm in the bathroom  He's looking at my pussy  And they went  Oh that's just  That's just  Father  Don't worry about him  He's a good man  Well respected in the church  Patty what else  There's other stories here  What else  Well I was told  That if I ever came  Oh  They used to tell me  Don't go to an amusement park  With a guy  Why  What's going to happen  Because I've gone to  Ride Playland  On the boat ride  With the rest of the  High schoolers 
[04:40:00]  And stuff  I says  What'll happen  Well you'll go  Through the tunnel  And stuff like that  And then you come up  The ride  You're going to have a baby  And I says  But daddy  What happened  In between the time  I was on the ride  And when I had this baby  He goes  Let me show you  And I'd be like  9, 10 years old  He'd be telling me that  And I didn't really  Understand yet  And I tried to get them  To tell me  What would happen  Between the ride  And the baby  I says  You don't just go  On a ride  And come off  With a baby  Now I understood  He feels like  A guy would take  Advantage of me  And I'd get pregnant 
[04:40:30]  Have sex  On a ride  Well that's the way  They believed  He just didn't want  Anyone else messing  With daddy's hole  You were daddy's  Little girl  He didn't want  Any guy  Fouling you up  Well I was  Up until I was 13  And I started  Rebelling against him  And I didn't want  Him near me  Oh near you  What was he doing  Before that  I don't remember why  All I know is that  All of a sudden  I turned 11 or 12  And I was repulsed  With hugging  Either of them  Oh god

[04:42:00]  That didn't come until  I was like 11, 12, 13  Yeah no shit  Adolescent  But what kind of hugs  A little ass grab  A little ass pinch  What'd you get  Because at that age  You could almost like  Start protecting yourself  A little bit  Before then you know  The innocence was ridiculous  Wow  Oh dude she's gonna cry  I'm feeling bad  Because she's reliving it  I just don't remember anything  In particular  Oh you need to be hypnotized  That's why you're retarded  She's just stopped  Banging her head  Trying to forget memories  Let's take a picture  To remember the time  You took a bath  Yeah Patty  Oh shit  I know  It's okay 
[04:42:30]  You're just a little girl  Oopsie  Jesus I was joking at first  Because I didn't think it happened  But it happened  She has every sign  She has over the years  Everyone has noticed it  But I don't remember  Anything in particular  You wouldn't remember  Any particular episode  You blocked it out  You blocked it out  Patty  Oh Patty  What do you remember  I don't  Did you ever crawl into bed  With him  Or did he crawl into your bed  Oh I remember  I used to  Oh shit  I remember  When we would go away 
[04:43:00]  To his sister  In Massachusetts  I had to sleep  With him on the couch  While my brother  Went with my mom  And I wanted to sleep  In my cell  Jesus  Why didn't they  Why wasn't it the other way  Oh fuck me  I don't know  Why wasn't it the girl  With the girl woman  And the boy with the man  I didn't feel  Fucking awful  Patty  I feel awful  Oh my god  Oh my god dog  Did a sock puppet  Ever spit at you  A sock puppet 
[04:43:30]  I don't remember that  I'm just trying to put it  In vague terms  You had a brother  That slept with your mom  Where's your brother  I haven't seen him  In years  He's  You know  Went off  On his own  We weren't  A very close family  Everybody  Nobody's in touch  With each other at all  Dolores Claiborne  Are you  Are you not well  What the fucking  Jesus  Why don't you just  Move to Philadelphia  Like all the  Pennsylvania  This is crazy  We're getting more  Stories out of it  What else  So you had to sleep 
[04:44:00]  With this old guy  On the couch  I didn't like it  Because he smelled funny  You know  I don't think  He took showers  Did it smell like  The smell of Danny  Did it smell like  Danny's balls  I don't know  All I know is that  I didn't like his breath  Because he used to  Smoke cigars  Because it was just  Hot  And I don't like  That close to me  And the hot breath  Was on your neck  And in your ears  I don't know  It was on a couch  Yeah  So the couch  Is pretty narrow  What were you wearing  During these little  Sleeping sessions 
[04:44:30]  My little pyjamas  You know  Pyjamas  My little  Planet pajamas  You know why  She doesn't pronounce  The J  It's too close  To jizz  Pyjamas  I used to sneak  On the floor  And sleep there  When he was  You know  I felt more comfortable  That way  To pyjamas  And then if I complained  In one of my own area  I wasn't allowed to  So you actually  Got off the couch  Sometimes when he was asleep  And slept on the floor  Yeah 
[04:45:00]  Because I felt more  Comfortable that way  I could spread out  Oh boy  Oh fucking course  Did you wake up  In a little trap door  Where your pajamas  Were opened  No  Did you feel his  Erection on your back  No  I can promise you  That never happened  You never felt him  Maybe getting a little  Excited behind you  As he held on to you  How did you ever  See him naked  No  Oh shit  That was a breath  I don't think so  That was a  You breathed in  I don't remember  Ever seeing him  Without any clothes on  You don't remember 
[04:45:30]  Huh  No  You don't remember  That big giant  Foster hog  And what did mommy  Do during this time  Just bake cookies  Well they used to  24 hours a day  Make him believe  Actually  They never got along  They used to yell and scream  At each other  And argue with each other  Of course they did  Of course  What's that movie  With Woody Harrelson  You were the other woman  What's that Woody Harrelson movie  With Natural Born Killers  Oh sure  She was Juliet  Her life with  Yeah  What's his name  Ronnie Danger  Her mother was  Edie McClure 
[04:46:00]  Yeah  But just no one  No butcher came  To take her away  They just said no  Cause you wouldn't  Give up no pussy  A butcher  Would have came in  Woody Harrelson  Would have came in  And took you away  From all this bullshit  If you had gave up  Some pussy  Your own  Holding on to your own twat  Is what made you  Suffer through this  Yeah you should have  Some guy  Some old man on the couch  See a guy would have  Come in and said  What is he doing  I'm gonna fuck this guy up  I'm gonna beat him up  And ride off into the sunset  Actually they didn't  Fight a lot because of me 
[04:46:30]  They fought a lot  Because of my younger brother  Who had some kind of  Childhood schizophrenia  And saw shadows on the wall  He would tell me  Look at the monsters  On the wall  I couldn't see anything  So didn't Ronnie Danger  Remember the little boy  She burned him  The monsters on the wall  Was daddy's shadow  Coming into  Oh shit  And he would keep them up  All night  And they wouldn't sleep  So she would sleep  On the couch  In the living room  And he would sleep  In the bed  You know  They would never sleep  Together  What was the thought  You used to think  You'd take you away from that  Look at her digging that thought  Out of her head  When you was sleeping 
[04:47:00]  On the couch with him  What thoughts was in your head  I don't wanna  I don't wanna be here  I wanna be on the floor  But what was your make believe  How many make believe friends  Did you establish back then  Oh I didn't have  Make believe friends  I played with the other kids  On the street  And those were my friends  And that was it  I'm not even gonna lie  I feel like shit  I feel bad  I'm not even gonna sit here  And make believe  I'm fucking  This is horrid  What the fuck  Patty you  Something happened to you  I think something  And then we got to the bottom of it  After ten fucking years  She was fucking touch funny 
[04:47:30]  Uncle somebody got her  Yes  But I don't remember anything  Fucking fuck  Wow  You know in the last place  I was in  When I was a baby  Before I went to the home  To that house  To the home  They treated me very well  It was in  Masspath  Long Island  Masspath  You know it was in  A home for babies  They had some teenagers  That took care of us  And babysat us  In groups of three or four  You know  And then I went from there  To them  Patty we've done a lot 
[04:48:00]  For you over the years  We gotta find you  A therapist now  Yeah  We got your feet fixed  That's nothing  Compared to what needs fixing  You're all fucked up now  Fuck me  All these stories  Are gonna come flooding forward  When you go into therapy  And you're gonna be like  Oh my god  I don't remember anything  In particular  Look at your eyes  Your eyes are getting big though  Do you fucking see this dude  This is  You were scared of your step  Your foster father  Or whatever right  I don't know  If I was afraid  He made you uncomfortable  He shouldn't be in the bathroom  With a 13, 14, 15 year old  Oh I know that now 
[04:48:30]  He wasn't well respected  By the way  Well I didn't respect them  But I don't know why  I didn't respect them  Well we know  I don't know the exact  I can't think about it  How about the pyjamas  That had to be  Wiggled down slowly  Would you  Would you stop it  Get yourself fixed  So that you can fuck somebody  And not feel like  A creep  So a man can touch you  You can't be touched by men  That's why  Cause fuck in your pyjamas  I remember one time  When I was 15, 16 
[04:49:00]  I was sort of dating a guy  And all he wanted to do  Was kiss me  But they had friends  That would make phone calls  And tell them where I've been  And I was afraid to  Kiss him back  Hold on  Because I thought  I would be seen  By somebody  Wait a minute  Hold on  Let me tell you something  I've had a girl  Is this motherfucker alive  Cause I wanna go find her  I've had a girlfriend  The thing about  Molested girls  He's dead  He's been dead for 25 years  I've had a girlfriend or two  That got touched funny  I would just pull it out  Cause I don't care  So a lot of that is guilt

[04:56:30]  People ask where  Why  She'd be eating an ice cream cone  With the police hat on  While the old man  Comes and picks her up  Yeah  They'd shake hands at the cop  Give that little  Knowing nod  That hypnotist  That Ryan and Fez bring in  And you would have to  Put me on dark  We're going to  But listen to me  Like people ask  Where our line is  Fuck  I  Yeah  Here's Patty  Here's Patty growing up  You can get a doggy style  You can get a lean on your side  You have only choices  This is my house  And I get to see  Oh my  Fancy cock  Fancy cock for a whore

[05:05:30]  I just got off work  20 minutes ago  And ran here  That's true  Alright Paddy  What are you doing  Are you a model  For Sloan Kettering  Oh shit  I don't understand that  That's a good one  Jimmy  What's Sloan Kettering  I don't remember  What that is  Thank you  It's a cancer place  But it's a hospital  I love you too  To really  You know  Nail the joke  Oh Paddy  She looks like  She's dying  Listen for Paddy's improv 
[05:06:00]  Oh yeah  She's got an ashen  Face of death  And it's funny  Out there in radio land  Jimmy talk to Lily  For a second  Just babble  The thing is  That we have  Babble away  From the mic  So that he can  The beauty of Paddy  Is listening  To her improv skills  Paddy  Sorry I said that  Yeah  Jimmy  You can rip me back  I didn't mean to tease you  Give him a rip back  Nice socks  I'm not good at 
[05:06:30]  Things off the top  Of my head  But I'll think of  Something later on  Hey Paddy  That's usually how it happens  Paddy here's the deal  Last week you admitted  When Jimmy was gone  Or was that earlier this week  I don't know  We lose track of time  That you had some weird  Things happen to you  When you were in your  Foster home  Tell the  The bathtub story  To Jimmy  Yeah when I was  14, 15, 16 years old  Developed teenager 
[05:07:00]  When I was  14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 38  She's like an auctioneer  He was like an auctioneer  He was like an auctioneer  What the fuck  My foster father  Would just walk in  Nonchalantly  And start doing things  Like shaving  While you were in the tub  While I was in the tub  And naked and stuff  At a very advanced age  Of puberty  Was he shaving his face  Yeah 
[05:07:30]  And he would say  What to you Paddy  Tell Jimmy  I would say  Dad please  I don't want you  In here while I'm here  He would say  Ah you're just a child  I diapered your Heiner  When you were little  Your Heiner  But it doesn't make  A difference anymore  And now I'm 16  I'm not 16 months  Yeah but you gotta understand  Is that when you put diapers on  You get attached to it  You wanna see how much bigger it gets 
[05:08:00]  God damn it  So this would go on  And also you told us  That when you went  Like to your aunt's house  You had to sleep  With your dad on the couch  Yeah they would make me  Sleep on the couch  With him  When I wanted to be  By myself  Or have my own area  But they didn't believe  In that  Again I was  Just a little girl  And that was it  Wait Patty  Who would you go with  Your mom  Your step  Your step mom  Your step dad  Your foster mom  My foster father 
[05:08:30]  And then my brother  Had to sleep with her  God damn it  This woman's voice  Why would your brother  The thing that  Here's Patty's curse  Is that you can't have  Sympathy  Because of the voice  You just can't  Yeah  I mean even if she  Reported it  If she went to the police  I'm being molested  They'd be like  Shut up  Shut up  Get out of here  He's right  Mail us the complaint  Don't make us hear this  You know children  Were seen and not heard  Yes that's what I meant  Thank God  I bet the first time  He shoved his dick 
[05:09:00]  In your mouth  Just to shut you up  It started out  For logistic purposes  It's all he had  He would have used  A gassy rag  But he had his dick  So it's the best  He could do  So Patty  How old were you  When this was happening  15  16  17  19  19  21  Teenager  Teenager  Alright and how old  Was your brother  He was 11 months  Younger than me  Alright so  Why round it off  To a year  Critical difference 
[05:09:30]  How many hours  Why round it off  You'd get the wrong  Impression if she said  A year  That's true  She needed more syllables  So wait  You  He would sleep  With your mother  Yes he would  Why not have  Your mom and you  And the  I don't get it  I don't know why  I guess  See you would think  That  Because that would be  More normal  That would be non-rapey  So I didn't know  What they were thinking  I had no idea  What they were thinking  Boy they really  Fowled that up 
[05:10:00]  That was silly of them  So wait  You and your dad  On the couch  Now was it a sofa bed  Or was it just a sofa  With cushions  It was just a regular couch  Really big enough  For one adult  But a child  I could squeeze in there  I'm sure  And I'm sure he did too  It wasn't very comfortable  And I didn't feel comfortable  Of course not  So what happened Patty  How would you sleep  What position  He would be on his side  And you would be  Would you be  Face to feet  Or how would you be  I would be on the side  Facing away 
[05:10:30]  Sure  Yeah  Thinking of candy  He also stunk too  Because he smoked  A lot of cigars  And that made him stink  So his breath stunk  Yeah  Were you face to face  No facing away  I was away  He was spooning her  How was he facing  Right  I don't know  What was going on  While I was sleeping  I had no idea  I don't know  That's goodness gracious  You do know  What now  That's what we're getting at  You're facing away  Yeah  He's behind you  Yeah 
[05:11:00]  Now is he facing  Away from you  Or is he facing  The same direction  You are  He was facing  He was on his back  Mostly  And he was a snorer  And his arm  His left arm  Would be under his head  That was to cover up  The crying  Snores  So when did he first  Shut up  Stop  Shut up  When did he first  I'm sure at times  He would roll over  And face the same direction  You did  If he did  I wouldn't know it  Because I was asleep  I'm sure you wouldn't 
[05:11:30]  Have felt anything  But  Probably not  Probably not  But you must have  Remembered a couple times  Where you could feel  That cigar breath  On the side of your face  And the cigar too  And smell it  All I know is that  When he put his arm  Across my shoulder  Or my stomach  I would want to  Pull away  I didn't enjoy that  Oh he used to do that  I could understand  He would put his arm  Across your stomach  He would do that  Yeah  And I'm like  Oh my god  I would try to go like this  To get his hand  Off my stomach  Because I didn't like  That kind of handling 
[05:12:00]  Yeah of course not  I wasn't a hugger  Or going around  You know whatever  I hate the huggers  I'm not a hugger  You know my friend  My friend  My friend loves him  I'm like  You dumb hugger lover  Get out of here  My sister brought  A hugger home one time  Oh forget about it  Oh man  Fucking gold tooth hugger  So Patty  Hold on  You would feel him  Now when he put his arm  Across your shoulders  Yeah I would 
[05:12:30]  You would feel  Obviously you would feel it  On the front of your chest  But how long would it be there for  I don't know  All I know is that  I was used to going  To sleep early  So I would just  Fall asleep almost instantly  And what would wake you up  Sometimes  What would wake you up  His snoring  Other things  Or maybe if he put his hand  Too close to my side  Or something  I would start  He was fondling  Like a mad man  When he would touch your stomach  You would probably feel him  Pull back a little bit  Like you probably  Did you think he was trying 
[05:13:00]  To keep him from  Falling off the couch  Maybe  I don't know  But you know  I wasn't sure  But you felt him  Pressing up against you  From behind  Right yeah  And I felt that  That was a little invasive  Did you feel him  Pressing up against you  From behind  Like you felt his erection  You didn't like it  I don't remember his erection  I didn't  You know  What were you wearing to bed  Just my pajamas  What were they  Flannels  Piyamas  Piyamas  You know  Just flannels  You know  Jesus  With the fucking 
[05:13:30]  Little round trap door  In the back  Stuff like that  Little fucking glory hole  Pajamas in the back  She said they'd have  Cute little hearts on  So would he  Did he ever  Did he ever slide  Your little pajama  When he touched your stomach  Would he ever put his hand  Up his shirt  A little bit more  Than you liked  He didn't put his hand  Under my clothes  No I don't remember  Him ever doing that  Don't remember  Yeah  Was he ever naked  In front of you  What  Was he ever naked  In front of you  While shaving or something  Yeah  Well you know 
[05:14:00]  They had this habit  Keeping the bathroom door open  So I would walk in  By accident  And not know he was in there  And then see him  Going to the bathroom  And I would run out  You know  What would he say to you  Big beautiful cock  Nothing  Wouldn't say anything  No I just walk in  And run out  That's inappropriate  You should keep the door  Closed at all times  Well easy with those  Tough stances  You know  This kid takes social risks  Jimmy I asked  No shitting in front  Of the children  Oh bumper sticker  Jimmy I asked Patty  To take a few days 
[05:14:30]  To come up with  Some more stories  Do you have any  That you remember  Yeah I have a few  That I do remember  Something that they  Never told me  That I know happened  And had to have happened  But I have a memory  When I was three  Of a nasty awful  Leg injury  I don't know  Where it came from  I remember being  Held a lot  And carried  Because I couldn't  Walk on the leg  And to this day  Nobody will tell me  But I have a scar  Right there  And nobody told me  Where it came from  And I tried to ask 
[05:15:00]  Him many times  And I never got an answer  Did you get caught  In a trap  She's got  No  I have no idea  It was maybe about  Two or three  When it happened  So I don't remember it  But I know  Something happened  Okay so she's got  Casual memories  Of being molested  That repressed memory  Of hurting her  Fucking leg  Yeah  But I didn't understand  That's just dug in deep  It might be a chain  Oh by the way  The fella pressed  His fucking  Dick in my ass  What else  What else  Pat  Oh 
[05:15:30]  I remember  Oh god  Oh my mother  My natural mother  Had a mental illness  And she was hospitalized  That's why she had  To give me up  You know  She left you  At a diner  Yeah she did  Yeah  She got hospitalized  She brought you some pie  Before she left  She gave you  She leave you  With some cherry pie  She couldn't take it anymore  So I guess  With a baby  So she put me  In a basket  And dressed me up  To the nines  You know  Like  To the nines 
[05:16:00]  To the nines  And put me on  The one counter  Of the  Downtowner's restaurant  Well with a basket  That she dressed you  To the nines  You're a fucking infant  In a basket  If you were wearing  A drab outfit  People would have been like  Yeah I'll leave her  In the basket  Yeah fuck it  They said I got on  A pink dress  She sucks  Black and white  A beautiful  Pink and white blanket  What was the diner  Downtowners restaurant  Downtown  At one Trinity place  It's not there anymore  I went back to look for it 
[05:16:30]  Of course not  Who would eat there  After that  Someone left shit  On the counter  Which is another thing  I've been trying  To find out  Oh Jesus  God damn  Oh Jesus  I've been trying  To find out  God fucking damn  It in the ass  I've been trying  To find out  The circumstances  With that  And I'm trying  To look for  A police report  Whatever  Let him unlock  Everything  We want more stories  About your dad  There's no police report  Check the ASPCA 
[05:17:00]  We want more dad stories  We want the dad stories  There Patty  When I went to  The high school dance  He had to come with me  He would make me wait  Outside the dance hall  Or the church hall  Where it was  He went in  Looked around  Case then questioned people  Embarrassing the hell  Out of me  What would he ask them  I don't know  He made me stand outside  And if I came in 
[05:17:30]  He would almost  Slap me across the face  What did he ask them  I wish I knew  I don't know  Was he preparing them  For your entrance  Like saying  Will you be bothered  Please  Please don't  Probably what time  Is this going to be over  He said please don't  Dump pig's blood  On her head  Please not like last year  Four years in a row  You've dumped pig's blood  On her head  Exactly  Can you find another way  To have your fun  Don't stare at her mandibles  Probably  What time  How late are you going to go  And this and that 
[05:18:00]  What kind of music's playing  And all that  And then he would allow me  To come in  At that point  I would practically  Run away  To get lost in the crowd  So I could just get away  From him  Right  And I didn't see  Any other fathers  There checking anything out  So I didn't understand  What that was about  You were creeped out  By this guy  Yeah I was  I was  He was a little bit  Too possessive  You know one time  He was going to go shopping  You know and  With my foster mother  And I had a horrific 
[05:18:30]  Argument with him  I was 17 years old  And he yelled  And screamed at me  That I had to go  But I wanted to go  To my friend's house  Which is more normal  We were doing  A science project together  And I wanted to go there  Let's not gloss over that  But anyway  Hold on Patty  Your friend  What were you  What was the science project  Yeah  I don't remember  Something about animals  Or something  We had to go to a museum  And write about dinosaurs  Or something  I don't remember  But the thing is 
[05:19:00]  We got a phone call  In the middle of the argument  And it was  The mini Patty  Or Maxi  Or the mini skirt  At the time  So they were asking  For my opinion  He grabbed the phone here  And says there was  Nobody here  But a man  And a little girl  And he banged  The phone down  At that point  I had  I don't know what she's talking about  I ran out of the place  Crying  I ran to my friend's house  I refused to come home  For hours  This is just a bird  Making a noise  And he didn't come over looking  For me either  Which was surprising  No idea 
[05:19:30]  So Patty  Did you want to answer  The mini skirt question  What  Did you want to answer  The mini skirt question  The mini skirt  On the phone  Yeah I did  What did you want to say about it  I preferred the mini  Obviously  I don't know  The mini or the midi  The mini  You liked the mini skirt  Yes I did  You little fucking whore  That's nice  In fact  When I saw the  The movie  Hair  When I was older  That came out in 79  Yeah  I remember envying 
[05:20:00]  Those kids  That were  Going to Vietnam  And being killed  No  Being on the hill  And holding up  Anti-war signs  And flower children  I wanted to be them  Maybe because  I wanted to be free  Why were you  Maybe you did want to be free  Free from the sexual abuse  Let's go to Anthony in Virginia  He's got an idea  For you Patty  Anthony what's up  Yeah  Does Patty even know  Once she was getting  Her thermometer checked  Can we get a doctor  In there  To see if she has 
[05:20:30]  Her hymen intact  Because I think  She probably thought  She was getting  Her temperature or something  And her father  Was just reaming her  Alright that's a very good point  Some guy with the worst  Voice I've ever heard  Said that  Perhaps we should get you checked  To see if you had  Your hymen  Do you still have  Your hymen  Every time I go  To a gynecologist  They can't complete  The exam  Because they say  I'm too tight  And it's very painful  If I do go to one  I want to be put out  That's the only way  They can examine it  Is to put me out 
[05:21:00]  Because there's no way  I can stay conscious  Everybody in your life  Is lying to you  Do you understand that  Yeah  Jesus  Patty I'm going to have  To put you out  Because you're just too tight  That's the only way  They can do it  You may wake up  Feeling a little strange  Usually when a girl  Talks about how tight  Her pussy is  You get a lot  The only pussy  You don't want to be tight  That is not hot  All I tell  Is that they told me  That if I ever  Had sex  Or  You know  Her pussy is like  A fetus's ear  No  Not really 
[05:21:30]  No  I don't have anything  Oh I thought  Jimmy was being serious  I'm sorry  Patty do you still  Get your period  Not anymore  It stopped when I hit 50  Of course it did  Yeah  You hit 50  Like a fucking  Freight train  And before that  Did you use a tampon  Or a pad  I preferred a tampon  It was easier  Why  And was it a problem  Putting it in  Why easier to throw it away  I had no problem  Putting it in  I had a nurse  Show me how  When I was at college 
[05:22:00]  As the other girls  The other girls  Would throw them at it  Going plug it up  Plug it up  Plug it up  What is these for  Scary carry  Scary carry  Hold on  In college  What did you do  For the seven years  Prior to that  Oh wow  Good one  What was everybody  Missing socks  Around the house  No  They made me wear  The old fashioned  Kotex  Whatever  People found it  Like a shot deer 
[05:22:30]  With the handles  On its wings  You know  Strailed her  And then they wanted me  To wear a belt  She was bleeding so badly  Sharks were actually  Walking on land  To follow her  I remember  Hold on  Hold on  You missed that  Patty said that  She had to wear a belt  Yeah my foster mother  Made me put on a belt  For it  What's the belt for it  Oh the old  Hold up the fucking rag  That keeps the cunt blood  From dropping  That is real old school  How would it go on 
[05:23:00]  It was only 14 years old  Patty how would it go on  How would the belt go on  You know  Just like  Underneath me  And then you'd buckle it  And it would stay on  Is it like a sumo wrestler's thing  It looks like that  Yeah yeah like  The pad  The Kotex would clip  On to the belt right  Front and back  So you're wearing  Like a diaper  Jesus Christ  And a belt  Then you could just  Fucking bleed  Like a civil war veteran  Fucking  Turn it around 
[05:23:30]  Your cunt lips  Your mic isn't working  Patty  Your mic's not working  Don't waste that  It's an act of God  Yeah God  He doesn't want to hear  Either  Go ahead Patty  Yeah  So you put that  So from the time  You first got your period  When  I was  From 14  At 14 years old  Yeah  And what was the first one like  Did you have to talk  To your foster mother  Or what did you do  Yeah you know what  Exactly three weeks 
[05:24:00]  Before I got it  The first time  Then she takes me aside  And says  You're gonna be sick  Next month  Or the month after  Sick  This is gonna happen  You know like  Something about being sick  And getting pains  And I'm like  But what's that about  And then you're gonna bleed  What  But she wouldn't explain  Anything about it  She wouldn't tell you  Where you were gonna bleed from  Patty's got cotton  In every fucking hole  In her body  I didn't know what she was  Talking about  Because you know  That's something  You discuss with your daughter  When she's not 
[05:24:30]  How did she tell you  Did she say  That thing between your legs  Did you see La Mata  After the Ray Robinson fight  No she just called me  Out into the other room  And just stood me there  And told me  She didn't tell you  That your vagina  Would be bleeding  No  She just said  You're gonna bleed  And get cramps  And you're gonna be sick  Yeah that's all  She explained it  And sure enough  I had the worst awful cramps  The first three years  That I had it  To the point where  She would make a hot toddy  Which was 
[05:25:00]  Hot milk  And brandy  Sweetened with about  Ten sugars  And then make me drink it  And it would put me out  And deliver it  Via cigar mouth  Yeah  A hot toddy  Daddy would just  Put it in his mouth  And go  Right onto the problem area  I was too scared  To mention it  Because they made me think  The Lord was gonna  Strike me dead  And stuff like that  They put such  A doom and gloom over it  Were they religious people? 
[05:25:30]  They were very Catholic  How long did you live  With these fucking shit piles?  Since I was 16 months old  Until 19  When I was happy  To go to college  And I preferred  To stay on campus  How old were they  How old were you  When they fucking  Mercifully died?  When I was 20  She was 69  And then he died  About 15 years later  Did you have a relationship  With him at the end?  No  I didn't even go home  You hated him right?  I couldn't stand him  Why?  Oh cause he fucked her  Oh I don't know 
[05:26:00]  That he went all the way  Did he ever  Tell me  I know you remember  When did he take your hand  And put it on his penis?  I don't remember him  Ever doing that  Don't remember  No  He didn't go that far at all  Where'd he go?  Did he put it on your breasts?  Did he touch your breasts  A little bit?  Not that I know  Just like  I guess  Side glances  While I was in the tub  And stuff  That's basically it  Just looking you mean?  Yeah  What a ghoul  Yeah  Louie's gotta go jerk off  After this  There he goes 
[05:26:30]  Her panties look like  They're fucking great  Outside of Abigail Folger's house  Oh shit  Oh fuck  Fuck  We're getting Patty a hypnotist  That's great  We're gonna put you under Patty  We're gonna find some shit out for you  So she didn't say  Where you'd be bleeding from  So when you started bleeding  What did you do?  Mommy  Look what's in my pants 
[05:27:00]  Oh my god  You know  I got scared  She said  Call the Opie and Anthony show  I got scared  You know  And then she says  You got it  And then she  Gave me a coat test  And said  Here put that one  And  Put it on  She didn't tell you how or anything  She wore like a hat  Put it on  She showed me where it was  Looked like  Laura Ingalls bonnet  Had ketchup on it  Why is the retarded girl  Wearing a Japanese flag  On her head  Holy shit 
[05:27:30]  Fucking Patty  Wow  So you had no clue  Why you were bleeding  And she just gave you a coat test  She didn't explain to you further  No  But when I went to the library  To take a book out on it  Now I had a younger brother  At the time  And he was just 
[05:28:00]  As messed up as they were  He would take the book  And show it to them  And they would end up  Punishing me  And they would hide the book  For what book is it?  What book?  It was a medical book  On getting a period  Becoming a woman  It was a normal book  It was from the library  And they would not  Allow me to read those things  They wouldn't let you read it  I had to do it on the sneak  To learn how  On the sneak  On the sneak  Just to learn about it  That's what your dad was doing  Yeah  I had no other way  Of learning it  So what  Your brother now  What happened to your brother?  I don't know  Whatever happened to him  But I hated him too  Because he would 
[05:28:30]  Punch me  And give me bruises  On my arm  I would show it  To my foster parents  And if I hit him back  I got hit by them  He wasn't your  Biological brother then  He was my biological brother  And he had special problems  Special problems  He was born with my mother  Schizophrenia  Which is why he saw  Shadows on the wall  Coming to life  That I couldn't see  And he kept them up  That was daddy  She could be the most  Fucked up individual 
[05:29:00]  No kidding  So wait  Your mother had schizophrenia  Yeah my natural mother  Yeah yeah  And your natural  So your mom gave up  You and your brother  To the same people  Yeah  To the same people  And how many years  Since you've seen your brother?  Right now it's been  About 14, 15 years  I kind of fear him  Because of his illness  You know he used to be  Very violent  When he was younger  He would hit me  I'd have bruises from him  As a child  Where's he now?  He's holding the mic  Right there  It's Pat Duffy  This violent motherfucker  I was just thinking  I had very similar problems 
[05:29:30]  Yeah  Where is he now Pat?  Living somewhere  In the city  Or Staten Island  Or Brooklyn  I don't know which one  The last address  Was on Staten Island  But that's years and years ago  Why don't you just say Queens also  He could be anywhere  Do you have any family  At all that you  That you are with  Like that you know  That you know  Or  Nobody  Nobody  Do you have any friends  Or anything  Who do you spend most  Of your time with  Who do you talk to every day  Is there anybody  That you talk to every day  People at work 
[05:30:00]  People at work  One or two people  In the building  Like my neighbor  Across the hall  So nobody that actually  Wants to talk  Nobody that invites  Just people that you talk to  Because they're near you  The question would be  What  The back of whose head  Do you talk to the most  As they're walking away  Who takes a really deep breath  When you walk up  To say hello  Like they said  Hi Patty  The people I see every day  Are the people at work  And they love me  That's great 
[05:30:30]  That's great  What did your last period  What was that like  None of them  It just came  And it went  And that was it  What happened  It came and it went  I had not gotten  Any other symptoms  Or anything  No was it  Could you tell though  Were you like  Oh this has got to be  The end of the tank  There was some sediments  In this  Yeah  It had grimes  Like fucking Sunoco coffee  I didn't know  Something was going on  Yeah  Yeah  You didn't know 
[05:31:00]  I know  It's amazing  Motherfucker  You have the timing  Of a fucking rhino  You just like  Here's what you have to do  Like when you see people laughing  You hear them laughing  You pause for a second  Just wait a second  But like  Feel it out  Yeah  Let them get the laughter out  Because nobody hears half  What you're saying  I'm not trying to shit on you  But nobody hears half  What you're saying  I am  Fucking retard  Fatherless  Jesus  I'm going to do my impression  Of you  I want you to see  Okay  Louis say something  In the crowd  We'll laugh  Okay 
[05:31:30]  Now you put pressure  On me  Yeah  That's a lot  I really was going  To come back down  But they told me  That private blood  My father was poor  So I'd have bruises  All over  Heavens to murgatory  But if you pause  People will hear what you're saying  Yeah  Patty  Yeah  When's the hypnotist  Coming in  We're tentatively  Scheduled for  The 
[05:32:00]  The 14th  Or the 12th  The Friday  After the 4th  A week from the 4th  Have you been hypnotized  Before Patty  Never  You think he'll  Go under  I don't know  I've never been hypnotized  We'll have to see  It can't be one of those  Wacky hypnotists  That you know  Make you do wacky things  It's got to be like  One of those hypnotists  That can hypnotize you  And then really  Kind of  Get in there  The Ron Fez guy  He does that stuff too  But he's the real deal  He's definitely the real deal  Yeah  Alright  I'm open to it  And you're willing to  Yeah I'm open minded 
[05:32:30]  Are you  Yeah I'm very fascinated  By that kind of thing  And this has fucked up  Her sexuality  For her whole life  She will not  Be with a man  She's a virgin  You can see  From all that's happened to her  Yeah  That she's gotta be  She's gotta protect herself  She would withdraw  And wince  Yeah I mean  Don't get me wrong  I've always wanted  To have a serious  Relationship with somebody  Just that I  You know  I guess  You know  She's actually doing 
[05:33:00]  Pretty well considering  Her background  Left on a  Shut up  Trying to fucking say  Something positive about you  Trying to say  Something positive about you  Now why  Why would you yell  At Jake Johansson  Like that  I don't know  Why I'm so mad  At Hitler  If he'd survive  She kind of looks  Like an old Hitler  If he shaved 
[05:33:30]  Look  I just think that  Look she was left  On a diner counter  For fuck's sake  Yeah  Raised by a couple  Of fucking  Creeps  Yep  Schizophrenic mom  And brother  Some nurse  Shoved a tampon  Up her fucking pussy  And she's doing  Pretty well considering  Yeah  I think  Seriously  I think she's got  She's got a positive attitude  Yeah  She's doing terrific  She's got a positive attitude  She feels love  From people at her work  And she likes coming here  And sharing her life with us  She's alright 
[05:34:00]  I like Patty  Here's the thing  Let me just correct you  She's misreading  Their hatred at work  And she's never had  A dick in her  No but that's it  That's fine  Yes  That's all true  But she's got a positive attitude  Considering  Hey Patty  Pete she goes to work  And people literally go  Ugh  And she says  They love me there  And I think that's a testament  To her positive attitude  It is  And I don't mean this  But this  This is shit heap  I'm kidding Patty  None taken  Patty  How did the nurse 
[05:34:30]  Show you the tampon  Like did she put it in you  Or did she show you  With something else  She just went  With hand motions  She made her do a hand  She made her do a handstand  And then threw it  Like a javelin  She made her do a chart  Where the area was  Plays in cunt  Light fuse  Get away  She showed me on a chart  A chart  Yeah she showed me a photo  And then it goes here  And then she went like that  With the motion  The correct motion  And that was it  She said you're slipping in there 
[05:35:00]  And did you have trouble  The first time you tried to put it in  Of course I did  And what happened  The first time  It was painful  The first two times  After that  It was easy  Did you get it in deep enough  Yeah  You probably  Because I can picture you  Just putting the tip in  And fucking cotton's  Hanging out of it  It's hanging out like a cigar  But I was okay  After the third month  Of doing it  Third month  It took you three months  To figure out  How to shove a fucking tampon  It took her three months  Before she figured out  She had to take the first one out  Did you tell the nurse 
[05:35:30]  So I got a stab  Three times  I just thanked her  And said if I have any  Questions I'll call you  I didn't have any questions  I kind of learned  On my own  Yeah  I bet you did though  You didn't put it in  Far enough the first time  Right  Because you were hurt  Was it painful  Yeah the first  Was it a little exciting though  Like were you kind of like  Ooh I'm putting something  In my pussy  Yeah the thing I liked best  Was the convenience  Any question you want to answer  Yeah
