<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in banter about their show's history of controversy and FCC violations, immediately transitioning into a discussion of Rebecca Black's "Friday," debating its inexplicable popularity and its potential placement on SiriusXM's Hits 1.  This segued into highly offensive commentary regarding Kesha's body. One host then related his experience buying a dishwasher, humorously comparing the process to bringing Kesha home. A caller, Rick from Oklahoma, complained about General Electric appliances, linking his grievances to political views and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This sparked further discussion about appliance purchases and the absurdity of tree-cutting permits.

The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's awkward encounter with Diana Ross on a plane, detailing his unsuccessful attempt to get a photograph.  The hosts returned to Rebecca Black, speculating on the reasons behind her unexpected fame and comparing her situation to the rise and fall of the hair metal genre. Several hair metal bands were named as potential equivalents to Black. A caller mentioned a purported Bob Dylan song similar to "Friday," which was ultimately revealed to be a coincidental parody. Studio employee Sam participated in some of these discussions.  The segment concluded with more banter and music.

The next segment began with an unidentified, angry exchange filled with racial slurs and sexually suggestive language.  This abruptly transitioned to a discussion of Pink Floyd's *Dark Side of the Moon*’s 38th anniversary and a detailed analysis of "When the Tigers Broke Free," described as "miserable" but "great."  The discussion included the song's origins and Roger Waters' feelings.  This was followed by a discussion of a breast-feeding baby doll marketed to children, eliciting strong reactions.  The conversation then turned to Syd Barrett’s mental health and departure from Pink Floyd, with a caller offering insights into his life.  The latter half featured a "bertation" (a newscaster's rambling mistake) and a discussion of celebrities like Liz Taylor, Joan Rivers, Mickey Rooney, and Chaz Bono, often using derogatory and offensive language.  The hosts also discussed a "double-talker" and Charlie Callas, playing clips of their performances.  Jimmy was possibly a guest during this segment.

The show continued with a rambling discussion about Conrad Hilton and Conrad Bain, leading to a boast about the hosts' *Different Strokes* knowledge.  They then introduced upcoming guests Nick DiPaolo and Nikki Benz ("Nikki Feather Benz").  A conversation ensued about the studio's drop ceiling and past air conditioning mishaps, including a humorous anecdote about a potential lawsuit.  The hosts mentioned an obituary written six years prior for Elizabeth Taylor and announced "Brother Joe Day," promoting Joe's website NotU2.com.  The focus then shifted to Chris Brown's apology following a Good Morning America incident, with the hosts and Jimmy expressing skepticism about its sincerity. They discussed his publicist's "talking points" and the hypocrisy of his "positivity" campaign.  Barbara, a listener, called in to confirm that Good Morning America didn't provide Chris Brown with talking points.  The conversation touched upon celebrities controlling their public image.  The arrival of Nick DiPaolo marked a shift in the conversation. DiPaolo's tweets were praised, and the "Last Night Never Happened" app was discussed. DiPaolo offered a surprisingly positive view of Chris Brown, leading to a discussion about media bias and differing treatment of celebrities based on race. The hosts and DiPaolo engaged in a discussion about Obama's presidency, criticizing his perceived weaknesses using strong language. A segment about bad chili was interjected before moving to DiPaolo's upcoming shows. The show concluded with a lengthy segment about Alonzo Hamburger Jones, playing a video clip of his act and including discussions of Gallagher and Bill Burr.

A segment featured a phone call with comedian Rich Voss, where the hosts teased him about his appearance on Def Comedy Jam, focusing on the pressure of being the first white comedian on the show. Voss shared anecdotes about his experience. Clips of Shucky Ducky's stand-up, filled with offensive racial humor, were then played.  Nicky Benz joined the studio, addressing rumors of anal sex on the Howard Stern show and engaging in explicit conversations about sex with the hosts.  There was also a failed attempt to install a stripper pole. Benz promoted Penthouse's online store and offered a lap dance for Roland, a staff member.

Finally, a segment with Nick DiPaolo and Nikki Benz featured highly graphic sexual descriptions and humor, including extensive and explicit commentary on female genitalia. They speculated about the anatomy of various celebrities and porn stars, including Vanessa Del Rio. Benz promoted her work, including 3D pornography on Penthouse.com, and DiPaolo detailed his upcoming stand-up performances. A brief preview of an upcoming Jim Norton segment featuring an anecdote about anal sex was played.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  The show.  Let's get the show on the road.  Like that one.  Yeah.  It's like the only Charlie Sheen thing I like listening to.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  The show.  Yeah.  He's still winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  Winning.  For pedo of truth.  Winning.  Pedo of truth.  Winning.  Shut up. 
[00:01:30]  You're not winning.  You're a dumbass.  What's more annoying?  Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?  Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  You got it.  Poor Rebecca Black.  You know, I was sitting around.  Yeah.  Talking radio yesterday.  Something I like to do when I'm not here, believe it or not.  Talking a little rad diddy-o, as you say.  I found out that Hits 1 here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio doesn't play Rebecca Black Friday.  I was wondering if any of the channels here played that diddy. 
[00:02:00]  Why wouldn't you play that?  That tune.  It's no worse than any Justin Bieber song.  No.  I know a lot of people hate it, and that's why it's such a popular song, but now I think  it's going from people hating it to wanting to hear it.  Certainly not our audience, but the audience that would listen to that crap, they want  to hear it now.  I got to tell you, some mornings I wake up, and the second I open my eyes, that fucking  dumbass song is stuck in my head.  Is it really? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  In a very annoying way.  What part gets to it?  Not like, you know, something good.  Well, the Friday, Friday part.  But then also, just like, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Just like saying fun.  Hey, you work for Hits 1, right?  Yes.  What's your name?  Just for every...  It's better to just list the channels that Sam doesn't work for.  Right.  Yeah, it's easier.  It'd be faster that way.  And why aren't they playing Friday, Friday?  I think because they know it's very short-term. 
[00:03:00]  So play it until it burns out.  Oh, like every other song on there?  Well, I mean, they last more than a week.  It's been over a week, and people are still digging on the Friday, Friday.  Are they taking themselves too seriously over at Hits 1?  Because they're a silly little pop station.  So play the silly little pop song.  Because they play it as a joke on, like, the morning show.  Yeah, but it's a joke.  But I could look at their playlist and point out a bunch of other songs they're playing  that they don't think are jokes that are jokes. 
[00:03:30]  Well, the people don't think they're jokes.  Any Justin Bieber song is a joke.  Joke.  Yeah, but the folks don't think they're jokes.  Yeah, they do.  The Bieber fans?  The pop fans do.  I don't know.  We don't play a lot of Bieber.  Huh?  We don't play a lot of Bieber.  Why?  I guess because people think it's a joke.  No Bieber?  We play a lot of Kesha.  A lot of Kesha.  A lot of Katy Perry.  She's a pig.  That great body on Kesha.  You ever see her on the internet in the bikinis?  Wow.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  If anyone should really hide in some heavier clothing so people go, I can't really make 
[00:04:00]  out if she's a jerk.  I had to buy a dishwasher yesterday.  She is shaped like a dishwasher.  I know where you're going with it.  Okay, good.  That's what I was getting at.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I was just fucking around.  No.  I dragged that dishwasher box home to my apartment, and I was thinking Kesha the whole time.  Kesha.  It's like bringing Kesha home.  Look at that fucking horrendous body.  That awful fucking shape.  There's nothing.  Like, it doesn't go in. 
[00:04:30]  From our shoulders to our hips is a straight, flabby line.  It's a complete line.  It's a complete straight line.  Have you ever had to buy a dishwasher?  No.  I actually, they're usually in the house.  I walked into PC Richards yesterday, and it was like, I didn't know what the fuck.  I'm like, am I actually buying a dishwasher?  There you go.  That wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad. 
[00:05:00]  That's better.  Okay.  I just had a practice.  Did the Yankees just strike someone out?  No kidding.  No kidding.  I walked in there.  You want to guess how long it took?  Probably a long time.  From walking in to purchasing, less than two minutes.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then?  I'm not one of these shopping guys.  Right.  I don't need the bells and whistles.  I assume if they got dishwashers on the wall, they'd have to work pretty good. 
[00:05:30]  They're all good.  And then I'm thinking, GE sounds like they're a good company.  Yeah.  They've made a lot of things over the years.  And I saw a white one, and the one I'm replacing is white.  So I'm like, white, GE, middle of the road.  Let's buy this thing.  Sold.  Yeah.  Well, I like when they come around.  It's like, well, this has this.  It's like everything that it does is listed on a little card in front.  Really?  I didn't read that.  Oh, I know.  You don't even have to do that most of the time. 
[00:06:00]  But store salespeople really do things that are kind of obvious.  It's like, oh, I want to buy this computer.  Well, this has this.  You don't have to tell me.  I know what it's got.  I read it right here.  That's why I go for the middle.  Yeah.  Not the low end.  Not the high end.  Right in the middle has to be good.  It's got to be good.  Unless it's a TV.  It's not overpriced.  Or a computer or something.  Yeah, yeah.  But everything else, right in the fucking middle.  Yeah.  Because I know the high end has bells and whistles I could give a fuck about.  Wow, look at her body. 
[00:06:30]  It's horrendous.  Oh, what is going on there?  Now we've got the side shot where there's not a hint of an ass on Kesha's body.  No ass.  She's got like a paunch going on in the front.  And she doesn't even know how to hang out at a good beach.  That's a shitty beach.  Stepping on rocks.  To match her shitty ass.  She's built like a guy.  She really is.  I don't even know if she's built like a...  I don't know what she's built like.  Because she's got like more stomach than a girl should have and she's got less ass than  a girl should have.  Yeah, yeah.  But then people would think she's got a gut.  It's not really... 
[00:07:00]  It's just thick.  It's a little thick, paunchy thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's horrendous.  And she seems like she's a lot older than when she's portrayed.  She has a big post belly.  I bet you she's saying she's in her 20s.  Yeah, she's definitely saying she's in her 20s.  No, she's pushing 40.  Whoa.  She's got to be mid-30s, I'm thinking.  And she was able to pad her age.  There's no way that...  Oh.  That girl right there is in her 20s.  There's no way.  She looks like someone's mom.  Yeah.  Like she's dropping a kid off at a school or something. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, correct.  Correct.  That is just...  And another one that has absolutely no fucking talent that is a big megastar.  She's made a lot of hits.  Look at her giant, ugly bloomer bathing suit.  Listeners, come on, look.  I like how we say that all the time.  Look at that.  Yeah, no, that's horrendous.  Well, you can pop it up on the Google.  Just put Kesha Bikini.  Yeah, you'll find all the awfulness.  Yeah, all the horrid.  Hey, man.  Let me go to some GE people. 
[00:08:00]  Rick in Oklahoma.  What's up, Rick?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Hey, Rick.  Hey, you know what?  General Electric is a great company, you know that?  Because they built those fucking reactors in Japan.  Well, yeah, see?  Is that a thing going on on the internet I didn't know?  You're not supposed to buy GE because they fucked up the Japan thing?  Well, let me tell you something.  Look, my fucking dishwasher isn't going to be hit by an earthquake.  And the tsunami's on the inside.  And it cleans the dishes.  Oh, really?  He's yelling. 
[00:08:30]  What, Rick?  I think that's supposed to buy General Electric because they're in Obama's pocket, you fuck.  Oh, is that what happened?  Is that it, man?  Is that it?  The corporate man.  I didn't even know that.  Anthony, Anthony, you should really never buy General Electric.  Yeah, man.  The corporate man, man.  I don't keep track of that corporate shit.  Hi, Jimmy.  I like the corporate shit.  I don't like Obama.  All right, I know.  You don't like Obama.  That's terrific.  General Electric built the reactors. 
[00:09:00]  They stood up to an earthquake and a fucking tsunami.  And they didn't completely fucking melt down yet.  So, you know.  A lot of people.  I always wonder why the phones were lit.  They're mad that I bought a GE dishwasher.  I don't even.  What can you buy anymore?  Why are they mad for that?  What are you supposed to watch?  You okay, Grandpa?  Maybe I was supposed to go Maytag.  I think that's the only other one I know.  Maytag.  What's wrong with GE?  They're jet engines. 
[00:09:30]  They made the fucking reactor in Japan.  They made the fucking reactor in Japan.  And they're in Obama's pocket, man.  Right.  Really?  I like when it was Westinghouse, right?  Built those nuclear fucking warheads, too.  Those motherfucking.  That's a diverse company.  Yeah, no kidding.  Dishwashers and nuclear reactors.  Nuclear reactors and shit.  I mean, I know you have to kind of spread yourself out a little bit.  Yeah, diversify, they call that.  Slow down.  Maybe go with washing machines first.  Right.  Not dishwasher and then nuclear reactors. 
[00:10:00]  Nuclear reactor.  Do you think there should be something in between those two things?  I think there should be something there.  I think a few steps.  I had to buy a dishwasher yesterday.  I'm an older guy now, man.  And this is the first time I actually had to buy an appliance.  Did you stand there looking at them all with both hands on your hips, looking and going,  No!  Were you exhaling through your mouth going, No!  Like you don't know which one?  Ah!  When things are lined up, you head right for the middle.  Middle.  Just like I do politically.  Right for the middle.  Right the middle ground? 
[00:10:30]  Middle ground.  Middle ground.  It's safe for me, man.  You don't get as many arguments if you're right in the middle.  So you're kind of a, I don't know, a libertarian shopper when it comes to your appliances?  Oh, you would have been all the way to the right.  To the right.  Seeing what dishwashers are at the end of the row.  Just a nice white one.  Gets things clean.  Gets the dishes nice.  One that runs real quiet.  Yes!  It's all quiet.  Not that typical dishwasher behavior going on on the left.  Jesus.  I went to Dishwasher Mania to pick out which one I didn't want to get. 
[00:11:00]  Just walking into an appliance store just makes you sad.  Yes!  Like, why am I doing this?  I thought I was going to go through my entire life without having to buy one of these appliances.  Ah, you got to do that every so often.  And then I realized I had no one to do that for me.  No, that's you then.  I got to take care of that immediately.  Yeah, I got Keith.  He takes care of all my shit that I got to do like that.  Like, I have to have a tree removed from my yard. 
[00:11:30]  How do you do that?  I don't know!  How do you do that?  You actually need a permit.  You got to go to the town because, of course, they got to get their fucking cut.  Wait, now you need a permit just to cut down a tree?  To cut down a dead tree.  They got to, first they actually got to come and see if the tree is dead.  I guess a guy, a fucking, a carna comes.  It's a dead tree!  Right.  We have to find out what happened to young Elm.  He's out with a bunch of other bigger trees and they're trying to feed her little, whatever  trees eat. 
[00:12:00]  I'm tired, Sam, I flew.  They gave her some bad fertilizer.  That's just stupid.  When we were growing up, you just took down trees left and right.  Yeah, it didn't matter.  You didn't give a fuck.  No!  You really need a permit?  Yeah, you got to go to the town.  They got to send someone out.  Make sure the tree isn't a living tree.  It's dead.  It's dead!  You're heating me up again.  And then you got to get your tree guy to come in there.  This is the shit that is driving me nuts. 
[00:12:30]  Enough of the permits.  Permits for everything.  When you buy something, you're supposed to own it.  So if you want to, you know, I'm kind of a nature guy too, believe it or not.  But with that said, if you buy a piece of property, you should be able to do whatever  the fuck you want with it.  Yeah, I know.  So if the tree's on your property and you're deciding it's dead or whatever, you want to  improve your view, you should be able to just take a chance out of that motherfucker.  You should be able to do it.  But no, not going to be able to do it.  How much does the permit cost?  I don't know, but it's a lot. 
[00:13:00]  Seriously?  Yeah, yeah.  Keith texted me about it yesterday and stuff.  And it's got to come down.  We need a permit.  And then...  Oh my God.  How much fucking money do they need from us?  I think I've got to grease the neighbor a little bit because I probably have to use  his driveway.  Right.  Because it's on my side of the house where my yard and driveway and fence and everything  and it'll be a lot easier for them to...  Really?  ...get it from his side.  So I'll probably have to grease the neighbor a little bit.  So why don't you go old school?  What's that?  If he's going to be a problem, you get your ladder out and you cut that first limb that 
[00:13:30]  takes out his fence and you go, well, I'm sorry, I'm going to need your driveway  or this could take out your entire fence.  Yeah, it's my fence.  It is your fence.  Yeah, isn't that fucked up?  When you buy a fence, you're buying your neighbor's a fence too?  Yeah, but some assholes...  I hate the fact that you buy your neighbor and the good part of the fence has to face  your neighbor.  Nope.  Some assholes make their own fence.  Really?  On top of your fence.  Oh, I've seen that with that little no man's land, an inch in between.  Because they want the good side on their side.  Yeah.  But you've got to put the good side. 
[00:14:00]  So now you've got a fence next to a fence.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that keeps you all nice and legal.  But that would be you buying two fences.  Oh, I know.  Because the good fence has to face the good part, the slats.  And then you get the pentaposts and shit like that have to face you.  A fucking permit to cut down a tree.  A permit to cut down the tree.  And it's got to be cut down.  But I'm kind of happy about it because that was the tree where the little fucking squirrels  would throw their fucking little acorns into my pool.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I hate them little squirrels.  So that's one less tree that'll be in the yard. 
[00:14:30]  They're taking their home away, you know.  Good.  Fuck them.  And it wasn't.  The tree was dead.  Like in the summer, there might be two or three leaves on this thing off of these branches  that were barely there.  So now that whole thing, God, goodbye.  You're going to be in the middle of an animated movie, you know.  They're going to have their revenge on you.  Yeah.  And the compound.  Oh, yeah.  You can't just take a squirrel's home away without all hell breaking loose in animation.  Oh, boy.  Although I can't fire off any rounds at a squirrel in my yard.  Although you can fire a pellet gun.  But you hit those things with a pellet gun, you hear a loud thud. 
[00:15:00]  It feels like you shot a bearskin rug.  Thud.  And then they just kind of go, and they run off.  It doesn't even penetrate.  How do you know this?  Oh, I did that like years ago.  I used to shoot fucking squirrels with my pellet gun when I was a kid.  They're just good looking.  I don't do it anymore.  They're just good looking rats anyway.  They're adorable.  Those squirrels are cute as hell.  Need.  And Bernie Goetz likes him, and he's not crazy.  Oh, really?  Oh, I forgot about that.  Alan in Brooklyn.  What's up, Alan?  Hey, Al. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, Al.  How are you guys doing?  Very good this morning.  Yeah, there's no time for that.  What do you got?  I work for a contractor out in the city.  We have to cut down two trees.  And a year and a half later, a million meetings, spending taxpayer money,  we came to a restitution that we have to give him $76,000 worth of trees throughout New York  to cut down two.  Wait, to cut down two trees?  Two trees, $76,000 to plant trees around New York. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, because you cut down trees illegally?  No, no, no.  We applied for a permit.  They will not issue us a permit as we came to an agreement to plant $76,000 worth of trees.  Once we agreed to sign the paperwork, they said, you know, go ahead and kick up the tree now.  So that's why the city is broke.  Anyone?  Anyone.  Anyone.  Anyone.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  Well, thank you. 
[00:16:30]  We don't know what you're saying, sir.  Thanks for leaving this mess for us to clean up.  Mars, go get the mops.  That guy was just rambling.  Anyone knew what he was talking about.  He was rambling.  Yes, Kenny.  The town shook him down.  In order to get his permit, he had to spend $72,000 and plant more trees in other places.  Oh, okay.  So they must have really needed those trees cut down.  Who would do that?  I forgot we had someone who speaks fluent idiots in here. 
[00:17:00]  He does us a favor and he gets shit on.  That's true.  He has to put on his little hat with the propeller to translate.  Oh, we were talking about Friday, Friday, Friday.  Now, Jimmy, you texted me, right, Jimmy?  I was on with her, yeah.  You were on with her on Leno?  She was very, I felt really bad for her.  Why?  Because she's making a shitload of money.  Yeah, money's one thing, but she's just a youngster.  She was very, very nice. 
[00:17:30]  I met her before our dressing rooms were next door to each other because Duran Duran had  like fucking eight dressing rooms they took up because it's just a lot of them.  Because it's still the 80s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although he sounded good, though.  I have to say, Sam and the Bond sounded good.  I'm not a fan of Duran Duran, but the guy he's seen.  Oh, yeah, he's still got his voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I liked a few of those songs.  But she was, I felt bad for her because a lot of, I don't know if the booker at Leno  knew exactly why she's as famous.  Like, they just knew that she had a song that everyone hadn't heard.  But if you're a booker, how wouldn't you know that? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  It's everywhere.  I'm not saying, maybe she did.  I just don't, to me, it was like, it was an odd booking.  And he gave her, I mean, he just asked her regular questions.  I think he asked her about the criticism and they let her sing some of the song.  But watching her rehearse, I was like, ugh.  It was a little rough and I felt bad for her, man.  Oh, no.  It was like, if she was 18, I'd be on board just brutalizing her.  Yeah.  But she was like, what is she, 14?  I was just like, ugh.  I just felt really sad for her.  So you're about 14?  She got thrown into the spotlight.  Yeah.  Without any real talent to back it up. 
[00:18:30]  Because obviously the song was produced in a studio.  And she seems really nice.  And she wasn't, she was, you know, for 14, having 40 million hits.  They're calling her gracious.  She was very sweet.  She's made a lot of money off the song, too.  So I don't feel sorry for her.  I just, it's like, you know, I don't like to see someone like that embarrassed that much.  You know what I mean?  It's like someone who's older is one thing.  But someone who's 13 or 14.  Well, then her parents should get involved and go, look, Mr. Leno, she's just not ready for this.  Maybe ask her a couple questions on a Skype or something. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Let's start up, let's start slow.  No, I think, I think the people they're treated her very well.  They're probably the only ones that are going to have her on without being ironic about it or shitty about it.  Yeah.  Anybody else that has her on will probably be fucking with her.  Would be goofing on her.  Yeah.  They were just, had her on.  And I think they realize, like, this song is not amazing.  So let her.  Not amazing.  What do you mean it's not amazing?  This is nice. 
[00:19:30]  What makes this different than, I have to crap you here on a pop station.  That's the problem.  Are we that old?  But that's the problem with it.  What's the difference?  The problem with it is it's bordered on parody of the whole scene.  Right.  So you listen to that and go, oh, this is what sucks about everything that's out there now.  It's like the tail end of hair bands when every band had the platinum blonde long-haired singer  and the dark-haired guitar player that couldn't fucking get his fingers on more parts of the neck when he's playing. 
[00:20:00]  It became a parody of what initially started off as, like, you know, fucking Motley Crue and shit like that.  So it just became a goof, and I think that's what this is now.  What were some of the bands that wrecked the hair band era?  I don't even remember the names, but I just remember watching MTV and being like, it's every band.  You can't even tell.  When they did a long shot of the band on a video and would start coming in on them,  before they popped a name in the corner or got up to the singer's face, you wouldn't know who the fuck it was.  It could have been any band.  Yeah, yeah.  But it did start with, like, a Motley Crue. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, those guys.  Kind of Whitesnake.  Even Poison, shit like that.  Poison made it.  Yeah.  I really want to know some of those.  Maybe, like, okay, this brings me back, wow, a long ways.  Bands like White Lion.  White Lion.  Might have been one of the ones you're talking about.  Yeah, I think they were in there.  They had a hit.  Cinderella.  Cinderella.  It was a little, yeah.  I always liked Cinderella.  I always thought they were a bit gritty for that genre.  Hanoi Rocks, Striper, White Lion, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  White Lion.  A bunch of people are coming up with names over here.  Great White, did they make it before it got a little too watered down?  Yeah, but Great White wasn't really a hair band-y thing.  Winger.  Winger.  Winger.  Winger.  Winger.  I like the point you're making, because maybe the next time someone that has some pop talent  will think twice before they go into a studio and do the audio.  And auto-tune.  And get the rapper.  Because now it's a joke. 
[00:21:30]  Because now every pop song kind of has to have that, a little rap in it, too.  It's officially a joke.  So maybe.  So it's time to move on.  And if you notice, when the hair band shit started officially becoming just a joke and  a parody of what it was, grunge fucking came out, and we had a new type of music that kicked  ass.  So maybe this is a good thing.  I know, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, I think so, too.  So, in the context of this conversation, who is the Rebecca Black of the hair bands?  Of the hair bands?  Oh, I don't know.  Like, Nelson? 
[00:22:00]  Nelson!  Like, who is that band where it was just like, fuck this, let's listen to something else now?  But it was like, Firehouse?  It was just kind of...  Yeah, they all became like...  Oh, how about, what's his name, with Janny?  Fucking Warrant.  Oh.  Warrant was just a goof of fucking that shit.  They really became like, just, oh.  What are they saying?  With the bad hits.  Cherry Pie.  And the chanting fucking... 
[00:22:30]  They had a couple of hits.  You know, you'd have Def Leppard originally.  Now, Def Leppard was one of the original fucking metal kind of bands, right?  And then, they, like, every hair band had to have the chant part in the song, and the fucking...  It just became bad, with the stupid, like, that hat, like, the police fucking hat on,  and the sunglasses, and the fucking leather, and it just became like a goof with the big poofy hair.  It got out of control poofy.  Watching some, like, behind the music on VH1, and, like, they were, like, the biggest thing. 
[00:23:00]  Like, Warrant was huge, and whatever record company they were with, they would show up,  and there was, like, a big picture of them.  Warrant and Cherry Pie poster.  Yeah, like, right behind the receptionist, or whatever, and they said, like, they knew  that it was over when they came in one day, and it was, like, a big Alice in Chains poster.  Yeah, yeah, a big Alice in Chains poster.  They were like, oh, fuck, it's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Goodbye.  So, maybe this is the end of that era in pop.  Yeah, maybe this is it.  This could be the death of it.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  7 a.m.  Waking up in the morning.  Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs.  Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal.  Seeing everything, the time is going.  Chicken on and on, everybody's rushing.  Gotta get down to the bus stop.  Bus stop.  Gotta catch my bus, I see my friends.  Yeah.  Kicking in the front seat.  What?  Fitting in the back seat.  Where are you?  Gotta make my mind up.  Let's see.  Can I take?  Yeah, and...  It's Friday, Friday. 
[00:24:00]  Friday, day.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Yeah, it's Thursday.  Thursday.  Kicking down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Party, party.  Party, party.  Party, party.  Party, party, party.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It might be too early for that. 
[00:25:00]  No shit.  People are waking up like, oh, God.  Holy crap.  What?  That's what it's come down to, though, that version.  Yeah.  But people will be playing Friday, Friday, every fucking Friday for a long time to come.  I had to hear it a lot because the monitors are on in your dressing room during the rehearsals. 
[00:25:30]  Now, was she doing it or lip syncing?  I think she was doing it.  Yeah?  Yeah, it looked to me.  It sounded like she was actually singing the song.  Our young Sam said it was lip sync.  Maybe it was a combination.  Probably singing over a track, right?  Maybe, yeah.  Oh, oh.  And it was unfortunate I had to listen to that after having met such a wonderful singer on  the airplane.  Who?  I sat behind Diana Ross.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  You tweeted that.  Going out.  She was a bitch to you, though.  No, she wasn't.  She kind of was.  No?  She should take the picture with little Jimmy Norton.  I'll tell you what.  I follow your Twitter.  She wasn't a bitch.  Anyone that doesn't take a picture with little Jimmy Norton is a bitch.  Under most circumstances, I agree with you.  A bitch.  But I chatted with her very briefly on the flight.  I mean, I was very, very.  How close was she sitting to you?  She was the one seat in front of me to the left.  Like, she was like 3A and I was 4B.  She had a supreme seat. 
[00:26:30]  What do you mean?  Yeah, she was in front of me.  It's kind of like symphony.  Boo, boo.  I recognized her.  Getting on the plane, she was like, they had a guy walking her on.  Her hair was kind of a mess.  I'm like, that's fucking Diana Ross.  Holy shit.  And they walked her on.  That's a biggie, man.  I'm trying to think if she's the biggest celebrity I've ever met.  She might be.  She's a biggie.  Whether you like her or not, she's a big fucking celebrity.  And so I get on the plane and she's there. 
[00:27:00]  And I realize I'm one road behind her.  So I said, hi, you know, hello, Ms. Ross.  What are you going to call her, Diana?  You can't.  So I put my bags up and the guy coming in, a black guy came in.  Uh-oh, it wasn't a pilot, was it?  No.  Believe me.  And I checked him.  I'm like, do you belong up here, sir?  And he was sitting next to her.  And he actually, he said, I am the luckiest guy in the world.  Oh, I'm with Jim Norton.  No, but he said that when he sat down.  I'm like, dummy, you just made her not want to talk to you.  Right.  And, uh, you know.  Oh, God. 
[00:27:30]  He just, he just.  Jesus.  What, did he panic?  Dude, he said, he said what we all would have thought.  Oh.  Oh.  And, uh, so he sat next to her.  It's due.  During the flight, she had her headphones on.  Everybody on the plane was just staring at her when they walked by.  And, uh, and a lot of people were saying hello to her.  Hello.  And she apparently was friendly.  She was saying hi to people.  I bet you there was nothing playing, by the way.  She just had those headphones on.  Yeah, probably.  They don't annoy me headphones.  Yep.  During the flight at one point, the fucking pilot came out. 
[00:28:00]  I've never, I've seen celebrities on, I've never seen a pilot come out of the cockpit.  Came out of the cockpit and walked up to her and he's like, oh, Miss Ross?  And he introduced himself and he had a computer with him.  And he had, he, he's got some type of a, a thing he's involved with, like getting vitamins  to starving kids or whatever, whatever it was.  How about the thing you're involved with called flying the fucking plane?  Well, he actually gave her the computer and asked her if she would look at something.  Um, she, like, he just, he probably didn't.  What's she going to say though?  No?  No, she looked at it while he was in the restroom. 
[00:28:30]  She's a captive.  But she looked at it and I didn't hear the whole conversation, but she's like, I'm not  sure if I could, but she's Diana Ross.  She, she, you know, she had to kiss the pilot's ass.  What a pain in the ass.  She's go, she has to go through life like that.  Everywhere she goes.  Everywhere she goes, someone's got something.  That's uber famous.  Yeah, that's crazy famous.  She's fucking sickeningly.  But anyway, as we were getting off the plane, I had to, you don't really, like, normally  you try to, you don't want other people to overhear what you talk, but I didn't give up,  it's Diana Ross, I didn't fucking care.  And I knew I was probably not going to get a picture.  Oh, no.  Dude, I had my camera positioned in my pocket. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, ready to go.  I would have just handheld, but I'm like, she has no makeup on.  I'm like, I know.  Oh.  Because she's a diva, I'm like, I know, she probably wants to be photographed only under  certain circumstances.  Yeah.  So I talked to her, I told her, I'm a big, I said, look, I'm a comic, I said, I became  because of Pryor.  And I said, and you know, you were so great, the lady sings the blues with him.  I'm like, what would you like to work with?  I didn't know what else to ask her.  Did she take her headphones off and go, what?  Yeah.  Well, she's like, please don't tap me so hard, sir.  And it is a wig, stop pulling it. 
[00:29:30]  But no, this is when we were standing up to get off the plane.  And she's like, he was a genius.  She was, you know, she was engaging about Pryor.  I'm like, was he good?  She's like, he was great to work with.  I'm like, oh, because Cicely Tyson in Bustin' Loose said that he was kind of difficult.  And she goes, she wasn't in Lady Sings the Blues.  I'm like, no, I'm like, no, no, I know.  But I'm talking about Bustin' Loose.  Like, I immediately annoyed her.  But I had said Bustin' Loose.  Yeah, she misunderstood and thought you were an asshole.  Yeah, we get off the plane, and there's three people ahead of me, between me and her, getting  off the plane.  And I have the camera.  I'm walking up the jetway.  I literally walked past the other people on my phone. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, I was fucking Ralph Rude.  I walked past everybody.  I didn't give a fuck.  I love Jimmy's photographs.  Dude, I barreled past everybody.  And then I wanted to get her before we got out of the jetway.  I'm like, because she won't do it out there.  But we just got out of the jetway and into the terminal.  And I'm like, Ms. Ross, I'm like, can I take a photo with you?  And she goes, no, no, no, please don't.  And that's how I knew it was.  She coward?  Not coward, but she kind of blocked.  But that's how I knew it was not, she wasn't being a bitch.  She just didn't want to be photographed after a six-hour flight where she'd probably been 
[00:30:30]  sleeping for half an hour.  Yeah, because someone would just throw that online.  Exactly, yeah.  Diana Ross looks horrible.  That's exactly what it was.  We'll have that on TMZ today.  So she's, I just, I fucking panicked.  And when she goes, no, no, please don't.  I'm like, oh, because my parents met at one of your shows.  You didn't say that.  No, no, stop it.  Yes, I did.  Oh, no.  I said that.  Jesus, this ain't happening, man. 
[00:31:00]  This can't be happening, man.  This can't be happening.  You're falling apart.  I lied.  I just told a lie.  And I don't know what I expected her to do.  I can't look at you.  As you shouldn't be able to.  Oh, no.  Dude, I don't know what I expected.  But she goes, oh, she goes, no, no, no, no, no.  But then she goes, I wish you well, though.  Like, she was friendly.  She wasn't a bitch.  I can't say she was a bitch.  My parents met at one of your shows.  My parents met at one of your shows.  In other words, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. 
[00:31:30]  Believe me.  So that's why it's so important to get a picture.  Dude, I was on the plane.  I was building a back story.  I was like, it was an acting role.  Oh, my God.  I'm so embarrassed.  I love your fucking story.  Dude, it was fucking horrible.  I said that to her.  Now, when you walked away, did you feel so shameful of yourself?  No.  In a moment, I was like, I didn't care that much.  Because, again, it's fucking Diana Ross.  And I had no idea. 
[00:32:00]  And then stupid Jonathan tells me, like, oh, she's good friends with Dennis, the guy that  runs my agent.  Dennis, she's apparently friends with him for years.  But I don't even know if I mentioned his name if she would have taken the picture.  Now, that's got to be your end.  I don't know if she would have done it.  Yeah, but if she was a wreck, she wouldn't have wanted to.  Yeah, because I don't think that was about her being a bitch and fucking going, no, no,  no.  I really think that was about her not wanting to be photographed.  She said, I wish you well.  Like, you know, she tried.  She said goodbye.  Oh, in other words, go away. 
[00:32:30]  She wanted me to know she wasn't being a bitch, I think.  But you definitely continue to follow her from a distance.  No, I went to the bathroom.  I really did.  Oh, you let her go?  I let her go because, again, I was like, what are you going to do?  I went into the bathroom, too, and just fucking locked myself in a stall.  And then the guy who was sitting next to her the whole flight, who was right behind  me, and I said that to her, got to use the urinal next to me.  I know he was probably so annoyed that I passed him, and he was probably so happy.  She said, no, my parents met at one of your shows.  Wow.  I was fucking...  What, were they gay?  I don't know. 
[00:33:00]  And I saw her at the Borgata, and I wish I would have just told her how much I liked  her live show.  I should have got an autograph, but I wanted to get the fuck out.  Do you want to have a fucking hour-long conversation with the woman?  Dude, after my De Niro debacle, when I first...  I'm like, I have to get something to talk to her about.  And the prior angle was good, but it didn't go as far as it should have.  And she misheard you, and all of a sudden it set you back.  Yeah, if I was sitting next to her, I would have said, yeah, I'll be on Lennon tomorrow.  I would have chit-chatted with her, but I just...  Cicely Tyson wasn't in...  Dude, Lady Sings the Blues.  I said I loved you in Lady Sings the Blues. 
[00:33:30]  You were so great, because she was.  She played Billie Holiday.  She was phenomenal.  And I'm like, but Cicely Tyson did say that, that Pryor was such a dick on the set of Busted  Loose.  She was dating Miles Davis, and he actually called Pryor on the phone, and he went, Richard, that's  my woman, and hung up on him.  Oh, wow.  Miles Davis said it to Pryor.  I guess that got the message through.  I hit him with a trumpet.  Like you're being a dick to my chick.  But I was fucking...  Wow, yeah.  You know.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's a great story, Jimmy.  You're incorrigible.  I was so fucking mad, though. 
[00:34:00]  Like, not...  I was like, I knew I wouldn't get it.  You gotta do TV with her, probably, if you're gonna get a photo.  That's a long shot.  Yeah, yeah.  She's gotta be all gussied up.  It's fucking...  That's a heartbreaker, though.  Yeah.  That's a tough one.  She might be...  I'm trying to think if she's the biggest celebrity I've ever...  Not to me, she's not.  But, I mean, she might be the biggest one I've ever met.  Recognizable everywhere in the world.  Dude, every...  But give me a short list, and I'll tell you.  I'm good at this.  Without boxers, because I would say Foreman was a big one.  George Foreman.  I'm sure the world's famous.  I'm much bigger.  De Niro's huge. 
[00:34:30]  De Niro's huge.  I have met De Niro twice.  De Niro's fucking huge.  He is, but Diana Ross...  Diana Ross is bigger, believe it or not.  She's iconic, man.  She's fucking...  Oh, Opie, that kind of slur is not...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Larger.  I misheard.  You're right, though.  De Niro is a biggie.  He's a biggie, but...  De Niro's a biggie.  Diana Ross is fucking huge, man.  Robert Plant was big, although she's bigger.  Didn't Michael Jackson pretty much imitate Diana Ross?  That's all you need to know.  That was Barry Gordy, I think, and Motown put them together.  But since he was a fucking 10-year-old kid, she was associated with him. 
[00:35:00]  She's famous everywhere in the world.  There's not one place she can go.  So who else can't go anywhere?  I was listening to...  I have some of her stuff on my iPod, because I really am a queer deep down.  But I was listening to...  On the way in today, I'm just listening to fucking Baby Love.  And I'm like, it's so fucking famous.  Yeah.  Of course you're listening to me.  Miss Ross, I really enjoy your music.  What's a symphony? 
[00:35:30]  But I'm listening to this, and it's like, you forget that a person actually sang this.  It's like such a famous song, you just think it was like always here.  You saw the woman that sang this.  But I mean, it was like, you're looking at her mouth when she talks.  She has a very distinctive mouth and smile.  Big whips?  No, just...  No.  Diana Ross.  Yeah.  It's like, I saw it.  It's like, you're just looking at her and going, that's fucking Diana Ross.  Yeah, she's got that weird mouth.  She does.  Yeah, yeah.  But she's...  I'm trying to... 
[00:36:00]  She's the type of person that could get into the White House or the...  Whatever she wants to do, she can do.  Especially now.  Does she still look good?  Without the makeup, she probably looks really rough.  She looks better than you'd think, dude.  Because she's got to be pushing...  Man, I would almost say she's pushing 70s.  That's what I would think.  Let's figure 64 is when she got like...  I'm guessing around the time of the Beatles.  74, 84, 94, 04.  47 years ago.  So, she got really famous.  57.  She's in her mid to late 60s.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Would you?  Oh.  No, but it'd be hard.  Oh, wait a minute.  For the story, I'd probably do it.  Florentine.  Oh, my God.  Florentine.  You can't play, would you?  You can't play, would you?  Because everyone...  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  The story alone.  Of course you have to.  Why not?  You would have to.  Oh, wow.  Is that what she looked like?  No, no, no.  She looked a lot better than that.  Oh, wow.  She looked better than that.  How did she agree to that picture?  Yeah, really?  She looked like shite.  If that's on the internet, then Jimmy can't do much more damage. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know why.  Maybe that's why Jimmy didn't get her picture.  Yeah, that's the last one.  She was...  That's why.  She looked like James Earl Jones in that photo.  Wow, she really does.  But that's why.  These divas don't want to be photographed.  Look at Cher.  You don't see pictures of Cher like that online.  Gray roots.  Look at her gray roots over there and a fucking big, like, waddle.  She had those big sunglasses on, though.  And then, like, I saw her later and she was, like, reading her regular glasses.  She wasn't getting bothered in the airport? 
[00:37:30]  I didn't see...  I only saw, when I came out of the bathroom, she was on the front of the line to go on  the plane.  I was right behind her.  And I was talking to the guy who was with her.  I didn't know she was there.  And then I heard her talking to the woman.  And I think she was just getting recognized.  And she says, like, could I just go down the jetway a little bit?  And I didn't know it was...  I'm like, who is this bitch?  And then I saw...  You said bitch.  I said, who is that bitch?  When I saw her walk away and I saw her hair, I'm like, holy fuck, that's Diana Ross.  Do you think someone like Diana Ross likes being that famous still?  Or do you think she kind of wants that? 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  That I just want to be left alone.  Wow.  I don't know, man.  Feeling in her head.  She's...  I was thinking...  Because obviously it gave her a great life, but has it become just such a pain in the ass  at this point?  She's been a fucking...  She's been the most famous person in the room since 1966.  Jesus Christ, man.  Like, literally for fucking 40 years.  I mean, I don't know when the Supremes became...  Yeah, that's real fame.  Because if this show goes away, we'll be complete nobodies and strangers within a year. 
[00:38:30]  A year?  Within a year.  By Tuesday.  Right.  When we lost our show for two years, three months, we were pretty much complete strangers.  Just...  It went away that fast.  It's nothing.  I'm not disillusioned here.  Yeah, we understand.  We know Diana Ross where her fame will never go away.  She's great live, too.  I saw her a couple years ago with my ex-girlfriend at the fucking Borgata.  She was phenomenal.  You really are a fan.  Dude, she's great.  Didn't you guys have a huge fight coming home from Diana Ross? 
[00:39:00]  I literally had to...  I think you told us on the air.  I told her, you're in danger.  Just stop talking.  You're in danger.  This is coming out of a Diana Ross show where it's a feel-good type of show.  There's a bunch of love songs in there.  I know.  You're in danger.  You've got to stop talking.  You know what it was?  We were fighting before because the Cowboys were in the playoffs that day and I wanted  to watch the game and she got mad because I hadn't discussed it.  I'm like, the fucking Cowboys are in the fucking...  You don't get it.  And it just started a big fight and I was just so resentful. 
[00:39:30]  We didn't talk to each other at all at the show.  We didn't acknowledge each other.  We just stood there.  We loved her, though.  She was great.  Did you tell her that your parents had met at one of these shows and perhaps, you know,  history was repeating itself?  That's an awful line.  It is so bad, Jimmy.  That's a fucking horrible...  It's a little rough, Jimmy.  That's a horrible line.  A little rough.  A little rough.  Hey, uh...  Megan...  Go ahead.  You've been famous since there were two water fountains. 
[00:40:00]  Would have been a better fucking line.  There it is.  I guess that was true.  You might as well get a shot in there because you would have got the same result either  way.  I didn't know she was friends with Dennis.  Get a little shot in there.  Fuck.  Let's go to Megan in D.C.  Megan.  Hello.  Hey, morning, guys.  Hi, girl.  Morning, morning, morning.  Jimmy, I love you.  My mom was sexually assaulted at one of your shows.  Played by me.  Is that true, by the way?  No. 
[00:40:30]  You never know.  That's true.  We've seen some things.  We've seen some things.  Played some areas.  At our road shows and at comedy shows.  What do you got, Megan?  Okay, I just want to throw something out there.  Feel free to poop all over me.  But this Friday song, 40 million views in 10 days.  Yeah.  I don't think everyone's playing it just because they hate it so much.  They want to hear it over and over again.  That's my point.  You know, I think you're right.  You can't get 40 million people to watch something they hate.  Hate is going to hate. 
[00:41:00]  Hate is going to hate.  You just can't.  Yeah, but it's also number 20 or something on iTunes.  We have to pay for it.  So people are paying for it because they hate it so much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think you're right.  All right.  I got to agree with you.  That's why I think hits one here at SiriusXM, stop with the nonsense and throw the dumb song  on your channel.  Yeah.  They don't play it?  No, they play it as a goof on the morning mashup.  You didn't get pooped on, see?  All right, Megan.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  Bye.  I've heard this and I'm a little confused.  Maybe Jeff could explain.  Jeff, explain this.  What?  You'll know in a sec.  Jeff.  Or maybe not.  Hey, are you from Levittown?  I need you too today, Jeff.  John.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, John.  What's up?  This bitch took a Bob Dylan song word for word.  It just said it faster.  Bob Dylan has a song called Friday?  I don't think it's called Friday.  My dad was talking shit on her because he played the song for me.  It's word for word.  I can't remember the name. 
[00:42:00]  Maybe Danny could find it.  No, this has been going around, but I don't know the name of the song.  I don't think Bob Dylan ever wrote a song about going to the school bus after he ate  his cereal.  Yeah, the bus stop.  Word for word.  No, this is something that people are talking about.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Do people know the song, the Bob Dylan song?  The kicking in the front seat, kicking in the back seat.  Exactly.  It's just like that.  He's not kicking in the seat at all.  Sir, then why wouldn't you remember the name of the song?  The one thing that can help us.  I never actually heard it.  Can you look down at it? 
[00:42:30]  Wait, I thought you said I played it for you.  No, a bunch of people are saying it's a rip-off of some kind of Dylan song.  I don't know the connection.  I have no idea.  But, you know, we could explore this for a second.  Rebecca.  Gotta have my bowl.  Gotta have cereal.  Oh, that's completely right.  Yeah, yeah, this is him.  Seeing everything.  Sure, it's Bob Dylan.  Well, she says cereal.  Time is going.  Yeah, this is really Bob Dylan. 
[00:43:00]  Taking on and on.  Sure it is.  Everybody's rushing.  Gotta get down to the bus stop.  See, does your father actually believe that this is really Bob Dylan?  I would have believed this.  I would have believed it.  Dan, I would have believed it.  I'm glad you said it first, because I'm embarrassed that I would have believed this.  He would never say. 
[00:43:30]  This is a vernacular of now.  They didn't fucking talk like this.  What can I take?  It's Friday.  Friday.  Gotta get down.  Someone's got a good bit going on.  It's a good cover.  They can imitate Bob Dylan.  They made up a fake Columbia record.  Looking forward to the weekend.  Weekend. 
[00:44:00]  Partying, partying, yeah.  Partying, partying, yeah.  People got info on this guy, too.  Right on.  It's a good parody.  Yeah, I hear a little bit.  That sounds good.  Barry in Ohio.  It's a guy named Mike Bauer.  You know him, Jimmy?  Because supposedly he's a comic.  Mike Bauer.  Mike Bauer.  B-A-U-E-R.  If I saw his face, maybe.  It's a guy named Mike Bauer.  He's allegedly a comic.  But a lot of people bought into this.  They are talking about this on the internet.  They really are.  No. 
[00:44:30]  I'm sorry, but they are.  I'm just giving you info.  I'm just giving you info.  Yeah, they're retarded.  We knew right away.  He's got a nice Dylan down, though, right?  He does.  He's got like an early Dylan down.  Yeah.  Should have crackled it up a little more, though.  By the way, he's ripping off Joe.  I know Joe's out there somewhere listening in between two U gigs.  Joe, yeah.  Joe knows how to do different versions of songs. 
[00:45:00]  Artists' styles with various newer songs.  Right.  Maybe we could play Up In Here, Up In Here.  People remember Up In Here, Up In Here, right?  Yeah.  Can you give me the original Up In Here for the people?  That was a fun song.  Oh, fuck.  This thing should have been a hit.  This thing, I think he did it before the internet was a really hot place.  Because this thing would have fucking went all over the place.  I like the original, too.  You're going to make me lose my mind.  Up In Here.  Up In Here. 
[00:45:30]  Up In Here.  Now we've got our go-to break here.  Our go-to bit.  Uh-huh.  We'll play the original Up In Here for like To The Hook.  Right.  And then we'll play Brother Joe doing his version.  That sounds like James Taylor.  It's amazing.  While we eat.  Yeah, because we've got to eat.  I have eggs.  You do?  Yes, I do.  How was L.A.?  Fun?  It was great.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yeah.  I'm on Chelsea tonight.  It was okay.  It wasn't my best Chelsea.  It was one of those things.  Oh, you're here.  How could you be on Chelsea?

[00:46:30]  Plows right into it.  He's positive everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock has his hat on.  That means he's here to work today.  Oh, yeah.  This is just frightening.  Love this song.  You hear this, and there's trouble going down.  Who sings this?  Uh, DMX.  DMX.  Thank you.  DMX, motherfucker.  All right, all right.  This is where it gets just too wordy.  Yeah.  Too wordy right there.  So. 
[00:47:00]  Wordy.  We just play that so you got a reference point.  And then Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course, came up with this.  The James Taylor version of that song.  James Taylor version.  It's haunting.  And we'll go to break with this.  Yes.  Yes.  Y'all gonna make me lose my mind up in here, up in here.  Y'all gonna make me go all out up in here, up in here.

[00:50:30]  Wowie  Dark Side of the Moon, 38 years ago  That album still is fucking phenomenal  Yeah  You a big Pink Floyd fan, Jimmy?  I'm kind of like a hack Pink Floyd fan  I'm like, I love the big hits  We call that beginner  Yeah, I'm probably a beginner  There's people out there, beginner dead heads 
[00:51:00]  Beginner Floyd fans  I go deep with the dead, though  I like Touch of Grey  Yeah, I don't go too deep with Floyd  I love this tune  And my favorite tune by that is probably fucking  I love Comfortably Numb  And Wish You Were Here is fucking depressing and good  That's a good fucking tune, man  In the dark  Listening to that  When the Tigers Broke Free is a great song  When the Tigers Broke Free 
[00:51:30]  You know that one?  You know that one, eh?  It's a weird one  No clue  It's about his father having been killed in a battle  And he's, uh...  Yeah, there's a lot of war themes  Talking about how they held a bridge or something  Uh-huh  And he got, like, a stamped thing from the king  About his father's...  Is this off the wall?  I don't know, to be honest with you  What album?  You're out  Hurry, before the vocals kick in  It's showing up here on the best of Pink Floyd 
[00:52:00]  Yeah  That's all it's listed here  When the Tigers Broke Free, yeah  Sometimes they take a second  It was an unreleased song from the wall  It was in the movie  Was this unreleased?  Is that what we're hearing?  Oh  Is that what I'm hearing?  I like this  Is that what I'm reading?  What did I say?  Is that what we're hearing?  When I'm just reading it  Sometimes you just say the dumbest shit  You know?  Is that what they're saying?  Oh, this sounds very royal and regal  Yeah  Why would they leave this off the album?  I don't know, it's fucking great  Make it a triple instead of a double 
[00:52:30]  Why, because it's miserable?  Yes, this is just coming in  Yes, it is  Indeed, off of the wall  Oh, here it is  Yeah, they take a second  You're not Pink Floyders  They meander  Oh, yeah  The intro is very long  And plodding  Why would they put this together  To never put on an album?  I don't know  It was rejected by the other members  Because it's too personal  Oh, what is?  Really?  It describes the death of Roger Waters' father 
[00:53:00]  During the Second World War  What a bunch of assholes  Here it is  One miserable morning in Black 44  This is terrible  It's great  When the forward commander  Was told to sit tight  When he asked that his men be withdrawn  Fun, fun, fun, fun  What?  And the generals gave thanks  As the other ranks 
[00:53:30]  Held back the enemy  Tanks for a while  And the Anzio bridgehead  Was held for the price  Of a few hundred ordinary lives  Oh, boy  Those Nazis got him, huh?  Nazis, Nazis, Nazis  When he heard that the father was gone  It was, I recall 
[00:54:00]  Our beat, Mach, Friday, Friday  All right, we get the point  Jesus  I like that  I love this song, man  I like it  It's definitely a deep track  Oh, it's fucking great, though  Deep tracks  It picks up  It does pick up, yes  After this verse  You always think after this verse  How long is this song? 
[00:54:30]  It's not that long  20 minutes  It's almost over now  30 minutes  50 seconds left in the song  It was dark all around  There it goes  I was lost in the ground  When the tigers broke free  Whoa  And no one survived  From the war  Confused in the air  As company see  They were all left behind 
[00:55:00]  Most of them dead  The rest of them dying  And that's how the high  Come out  To my daddy  From me  Hold on, guys  Just gotta do something  A little too dark for you  Holy shit  That's a great fucking tune, though  But Floyd got dark 
[00:55:30]  Great tune for when?  Driving in your car?  I don't know  Hey, this is good  Front seat  Back seat  I have no idea  I'll give you this  It's not a toe tap  Front of the tank  Back of the tank  This is a lot deeper  And likes to just  Keep it nice  I like keeping it  Popping and fresh  Yeah, he likes to keep it  Right on the surface  He doesn't want to dig  Too deeply into any emotions  The union  Of the snake  Is on the road  That's what I like  It's good  Fun, popping  The NZO Bridgehead  Was held for the price 
[00:56:00]  Of a few hundred  Ordinary lives  Ordinary lives  Ordinary lives  Our tanks  Were made of aluminum  They were right on schedule  Shut up  And get dumb words  We all drank tea  And our teeth  Were all  Rotting  We like  Dry irony  And we like  To pretend  That we're nice  But we colonize  The planet  We invaded 
[00:56:30]  Old Ireland  And Scotland  And wherever else  We invaded  Cause Jim doesn't  Know much  About the world  I didn't know  You could do Floyd  Who doesn't  That voice of his though  Holy shit  Yeah, he could kick one out  I'll give him that  We should do his version of Friday  He'll make it  That's pretty good  Deeply depressing  Wish You Were Here's a great fuck  Isn't that about Sid?  I think that was about their  Their other band member  Yeah  That's a good one  I do like this  That's a fucking  Wait 
[00:57:00]  What are you playing  Wish You Were Here  Oh is it okay  This is how it starts  Oh right  Okay  I didn't hear it  Yeah  It is a fucking  This is a good  That riff isn't too familiar  Though to  Most people  What  This is right  What's your favorite  Floyd song there  Ant  I'm a hack with it too  But I gotta say  Comfortably Numb is like  One of those  That fucking thing builds man  It's so fucking good 
[00:57:30]  Yeah  Yeah  I think it's about a guy  Being on heroin  Really man  Yeah  No you're not  Listening deep enough  To the words  They were fucking  They were really great  Lyricists  Yeah  You know when you do  The words thing  You're making fun of me  You know that right  The words  I know  You and Jimmy in the car  Yeah we were driving to Boston  I actually told him  Listen to the words  Listen to the words  I've said that before  It was Nirvana unplugged  Listen to the words  I've said it before  But I was never serious 
[00:58:00]  No  Listen to the  Where's that from  Sorry we don't have to  We don't think  People know how this goes  Yeah I know  Jesus  Fuck  What  I want to know  What this is about  I think it's about  I think it was to Sid  The one band member  I'm not  Sid Barrett  Yeah I guess right  You ever hear metal  I mean  The genre  Yes  No no  Where's the album called metal  Oh is it M-E-D-D-L-E  Oh yes  It's about Jewish mothers-in-law

[00:59:00]  Let's see  Fearless  One of these days  Might be  A pillow  A pillow of winds  Saint Tropez  And Seamus  Yeah I think it's one of these days  The uh  The wall's a great tune  I mean it's been overplayed  Oh this thing is a great song  Turn this up  You know this one is  It tastes like  It's Take It Easy by the Eagles  Ha ha ha  I don't know this  Never heard this one before  No  Alright  Do they sing or is it just music  I don't remember  I just remember that riff 
[00:59:30]  Oh wow  It says now  Oh okay  The song's lyrics encompass  Roger Waters' feelings of alienation  From other people  Like most of the album  It refers to former Floyd member  Sid Barrett and his breakdown  Okay  Jeez have a happy song  Did Danny  Did you just make that up  Or did you actually get that  That would be good  If you just wrote that  Yes  That's for wish you were here  Yeah it's a good tune  Fucking  They were  Yeah yeah yeah  One of these days  We could talk over one of these days  A little bit  This  You've heard this  Oh yeah 
[01:00:00]  Just keeps building  Sounds like fucking flesh  Ah  Put a cock in my asshole now  Master of the universe  I made that part up  I'm dirty  It's filthy  I'm a dirty bird  All is because  38 years ago today  Dark Side  Oh yeah  This is a very  What's this song called  One of these days  There's no  He talks at the end of it  About cutting  Oh it's all music  Cutting you up into little pieces 
[01:00:30]  Or something right  Yeah  And that's it  There was another big album  Released today  31 years ago today  What year are we in  It's an album that  You should know  Jimmy Norton  I probably do  Jimmy Norton  11  What's 11 minus  1980  1980  It's an album  I should know  Absolutely  Oh then I'm thinking  I would guess  Blizzard of Oz  Is because I should know it  No no no no no no  Is it a Sabbath album  No no no no  Okay  Ozzy  No no no no  I wonder if it's Kiss

[01:02:00]  It crosses  Ethnic and cultural lines  Probably better than any music  At least that I can think of  Yeah  Reggae you could play  You could play fucking  Bob Marley  In an accountant's  Fucking house  Party  You could play jamming  And you could play  With a bunch of  Fucking  Crips and blood  Not in my house  You like Bob Marley  Not really  Oh he's great  I'm not a reggae guy  No it has nothing to do  With anything like that  I'm just not a reggae guy  You seem like you'd be  A good reggae guy  No man  You like to kind of  Hang out  Party a little bit  I actually

[01:05:30]  And then the middle finger  Yeah  And like Ricky Ricardo  Would do that  At Club Babalu  On I Love Lucy  Shook  Shook  Shook  Shook  You know  You know who we don't talk enough about on this show  Who  Tony Orlando  Ah well  I don't think he's disgusted  Tony Orlando  I really want to see him  With or without Dawn  Doesn't matter  As long as Tony's there  Because you can get anybody to go fucking  You know  Oh the old oak tree  Who the fuck can't do that  Get that story  The breast  It's the breast milk baby  It's the breast milk baby 
[01:06:00]  And what they're doing is  They're marketing a doll  A little dolly  To children  Sure  And it breastfeeds  Sure it does  So I guess it trains your  This is a kid  She's got to be fucking  Six, seven years old  On the package  And she's strapping something on  So her fucking baby doll  And the baby doll goes  Oh my god  And uh  Looks to show  And I like breastfeeding  Sure  Wow that's weird  Sure  There's so much older  Than you think  And little boys  Don't become men 
[01:06:30]  Who breastfeed  A bottle  A boy can use  And a girl can use  Later on in development  Fathers use bottles to feed  And so do mothers  So these are ways in which  Both genders  Can really appreciate  I hate this fucking lady's head  The product  Whereas here  It's much more focused on  Much more catered to women  And it might serve as a confusing  Mechanism  Really  So what do New Yorkers  Think about the breastmilk doll  I think it's a little  Inappropriate  They have a lot of time  To figure that stuff out  They don't need to 
[01:07:00]  Worry about it with their kids  No  They don't need to know  About that at that age  No  No  I love the people on the street  Oh wait  What's he saying  Eat  That urinate  Excuse me  But they make them that way  You can say urinate  Pardon me  Pardon me  You know what  I don't have much to say about it  Why not  I know the parenting messaging boards  I belong to  This is going to be like fire  You know people love to talk about this  Parenting message boards  I want your opinion  You want my opinion  It's fine  It doesn't bother  Okay  But you know  On the record  Here's my thing 
[01:07:30]  You know with kids today  You don't need a special doll  To do that  At least he's trying to have a conversation  He really is  You don't need to buy something  Hey an opinion  Just to  You know  Yes  Holy shit  Do we just have an opinion on this  Wow  Really makes your thing  You're right  You're right  He really can't stand her  Yeah he has a fucking  Well she's the fill in  For uh  Well  Someone we shouldn't  Oh is she  Cause she's connected  It would be funny  If the guy said like  If he was trying to say  Like he goes 
[01:08:00]  Excuse me  But if he had said something really  Like they even have  Babies that  That will exhibit  Fake diarrhea  Excuse me  But you know  Sometimes you do  Sometimes you do  Piss shit out of your asshole  Pardon my French  What do you think  Come on bitch  Tell me  Yeah like  He has a haircut  Like the fucking  Like the guy from  American Beauty  He should be kissing  Kevin Spacey  In the fucking  Garage  Lucky him  Let's go to Satan  He's gonna tell us all about  Sid Barrett and Pink Floyd  Cause I think we just  Had some of that info 
[01:08:30]  Wrong out there  Hi Dev  Satan help us out  Dev  Oh hey  Alright  Sid Barrett was the  Original  Guitarist  I know that much  One of the founding members  And apparently  Back in the 60's  He took way too much  LSD  And um  Apparently he was  Already  Socially kind of  Screwed up in the head  Before all the LSD  Uh but when they  Started playing shows  And he would  He would go on  These LSD benches  He would crack eggs  On his head  In the middle of the show  At one point 
[01:09:00]  Lost his mind  Thought he was an orange  And had to go live  In his mother's basement  And uh  So he  He basically  They had to kick him  Out of the band  But right before  They kicked him out  They brought David  Gilmore in  And  Then they kicked him out  And then uh  You know  Basically life carried on  But he still was  Basically lost  And uh  When they wrote  Wish you were here  That whole album  Basically was  About  You know  Uh  Being alone  And stuff like that 
[01:09:30]  But it was  I think they said  In uh  Something I read  Sid Barrett  Actually showed up  To the studio  While they were  Writing that  So it was  Pretty interesting  But yeah  What year  They throw him out  So what year  Oh way early  It was early  It was early  Late 60s  I think right after  Saucer Full of Secrets  Yeah  And then the  And then they got  A bit more poppy  After Sid Barrett  Left obviously  Yeah  Well David Gilmore  Had a  Different writing style  And he pretty much  Started taking over  The band  And uh  Did him and Roger Waters 
[01:10:00]  Not like each other  Well Roger Waters  And the entire band  Don't like each other  Um  And then they did  You know  What was it  Live Aid  A few years ago  And they all got together  And Roger Waters  Was like  Doing interviews  Saying oh  He would love to get  The band back together  David Gilmore  Was like nah  He can pretty much  Go fuck himself  But they made  Millions together  They're in  They're in castles  They all  Were able to buy a castle  How could you  Yeah I know  How could you hate  A person that  Allowed you to  Buy a castle  Get a castle 
[01:10:30]  I don't get that shit  I bet he never  Forgave them for  Not putting that  Song of his father  I bet he never  Forgave them for that  Yeah cause that was  Too personal they said  Hey was there a  Documentary on  Sid Barrett  Or am I wrong  On that there  Satan  I think there was  Um  I know there's  There's tons of  Books about it  And actually he's  I think he's still alive  And he's put  Albums together  No he died  In 2006  BL's you ought to  Know this  Oh boy  BL's  Hey  Leviathan  You should be

[01:44:00]  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  You  Thank you. 
[01:44:30]  Thank you. 
[01:45:00]  Thank you. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you. 
[01:46:00]  Thank you. 
[01:46:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right on, man.  Jimmy's back from Hollywood.  James.  Yes, I am.  Until next week when I go to the Irvine Improv.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  And then I'm back for good.  Irvine.  Yes, I've never done it.  I'm sure it'll be a fucking big draw.  It'll be a hoot.  I'm certain of it. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, by the way, more anti-social network gigs to announce, but not today.  You tease.  We have more to announce, which is good.  This one's almost sold out in Connecticut, so that's good.  Where are you going?  Philly?  No, but I can't say.  Cleveland.  Nice.  No.  Oh, you just lied.  No.  Huh?  No.  Huh?  I'll tell you when they're confirmed.  Oh.  Confirmed.  We're making faces at each other. 
[01:47:30]  I'm trying to figure it out with Jimmy.  That's very cool.  Chris Brown apologized.  What a doodly.  It's too late, man.  His real self came out the other day.  You just know who this guy is.  What a baby.  It's too late.  He doesn't want anybody to ask him.  But no one wants to hear about your fucking album.  Oh, well.  Yeah, you appreciate the fans.  People want to buy it.  We get it.  You appreciate the fans.  Who gives a shit?  The album's kind of doing well, Jimmy.  It's going to be great.  I think it's had three hits already.  Sure.  Yeah, no.  Rihanna was the first one.  Yes. 
[01:48:00]  I believe.  It's amazing.  As a singer, you can just punch your chick in the face.  Nobody gives a hoot.  No one cares.  Well, he beat up the dressing room the other day after his GMA appearance, and now he  went on 106th and Park.  What's that?  It's one of those black shows.  I don't know.  And he apologized.  Do you want to hear this?  Sure.  I love a good, insincere apology.  Right now, we are still joined by Chris Brown.  He is here.  And, you know, of course, a lot of people are talking about what happened yesterday.  A lot went on.  First of all, are you okay?  I'm great.  You know, I'm actually, as you see, after the incident, fuck with you. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  No, it was Robin Roberts.  I know.  Well, she's kind of white.  She's kind of.  Yeah.  She was groveling and annoying, too.  Thank you for letting us go.  Why don't you be a, you should have put Matt Lauer on the case.  Yeah.  Matt Lauer is good.  He's glib.  You like the Matt Lauer?  Yeah.  He fucking pussied Cruz.  Tom Cruise is not an easy guy to alpha male, and he fucking certainly did.  Yeah.  You know, with my people and just, you know, trying to enjoy life and enjoy this experience  of having my album on, you know.  But I just think yesterday, first of all, I want to apologize to anybody who was startled 
[01:49:00]  in the office, anybody who was offended or really, or really looked and disappointed  at my actions, because I was disappointed in the way I acted.  And, you know, a lot of people don't know what went down.  And, you know, obviously, when I do shows or when I do interviews, we always send out  like a talking point sheet, you know.  It's a non-talking point motherfucker.  Network whoever isn't complying with what we want to do, and so we can equally accomplish  a goal, we usually kind of back out and wait till it's a better situation, you know.  Real brave artists.  So we actually did this event. 
[01:49:30]  We were, everything was cool.  You know, we were supposed to perform.  Wait, there was one of the publicists?  Yeah, one of the, yeah.  They get the soft questions.  Well, real fucking brave artists, man.  I love these guys that they want to just talk about their fucking album.  That's a real interesting interview.  Who gives a fuck about your album?  I'm sure it's going to sell a lot of copies, but in an interview, it's boring to hear your  positivity shit.  He puts a personality forward where it looks like he can take some shit.  And then he goes in the dressing room and pulls a fucking dishwasher out. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  For those of you listening earlier.  A guy that fucking, a guy that tattooed though, why does a guy that tattooed need a fucking  publicist to send a talking point?  Especially since his album is, it's fame and it's an acronym.  It stands for like forgiving all my enemies.  Yeah.  And he defines part of his enemies as like the haters or whatever, who are giving him  shit from the fallout from that.  So if you can make an album out of it, why can't you talk about where it came from?  Right, exactly.  Yeah, bravo. 
[01:50:30]  There's certainly a connection worth mentioning.  Stop with that phone.  Why are black artists obsessed with proving how positive they are?  Enough.  Their Twitters are all like that.  You know, be good to yourself or no one will be good to you.  Right?  Stop trying to be a sage.  Sage.  Fucking annoys me.  Cut the shit.  Mark the day.  I think this is the first time the word sage was used on our show.  Fucking drives me nuts.  Yeah.  You know, you got to empower yourself. 
[01:51:00]  Take what you want or what you want won't take you.  I got it.  You reverse the words.  You're deep.  Fuck yourself.  Danny.  Fake positivity drives me nuts.  You might want to go to the window right now.  Oh, shit.  She's coming up here.  Damn.  She's carrying some coffee.  Is the show on out there?  It shouldn't be.  She's carrying a couple of things of coffee and another thing.  She's got a long head.  Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. 
[01:51:30]  Okay, she's gone.  Yeah, she does kind of have an Easter Island head.  Oh, Jimmy's.  Remember the old gag we used to do when somebody had to take a phone call?  No, I don't remember that gag.  What is the gag?  Well, we just yell real loud bad words.  What were we yelling?  I don't remember.  I don't really remember this.  You'd be like, shut up, you fucking cunt, and shit like that.  Yeah, I don't know.  Dick and balls.  Some fucking foreigner.  What?  I don't know.  Ew.  They're getting very, very tricky.  What, the salespeople? 
[01:52:00]  I think there's a new one where they use area codes where you call a lot, the telemarketers.  Have you gotten that one yet?  Well, you recognize the area code.  In my case, it would be...  Oh, so you're like, oh, let me answer that.  In my case, it would be a Philadelphia area code.  Get a lot of calls from that area, obviously.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, that's the area code.  Oh, all right.  I got to answer this one.  Sneaky.  I don't know.  Or it was just a coincidence that that one just happened to come from an area code that  I use a lot.  Turkey Chili has arrived. 
[01:52:30]  This is real bad.  Here's more Chris Brown.  We actually did this event.  Everything was cool.  We were supposed to perform.  The talking points were positivity, creative, and everything else sent to me.  Of course.  It was about the album.  That's what we were talking about.  So as the interview proceeded, you know, it was kind of thrown off.  I was thrown off by it.  It wasn't this deep.  You pulled it.  You had a hitsy fit.  Yeah.  Don't make it like it was this deep fucking thing that happened.  This spiritual, you know, this serene and positivity.  Shut up.  I'm trying to sound smart. 
[01:53:00]  And GMA's all over this today.  We got info from Barbara coming in from Connecticut.  What's up, Barbara?  Hello, Barbara.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Mom's name.  They're coming for you, Barbara.  How are you?  Terrific.  Good morning, America.  This morning commented on his apology on BET yesterday and claimed that they did not  issue a talking point list to him.  Of course they didn't.  So he's full of shit.  Yeah, because that drives us nuts.  Tommy Lee pulled that bullshit on us many years ago where he goes, you were told not 
[01:53:30]  to.  Talk about Pam.  And that's the last thing we ever want to hear from any of these douchebags.  You were told.  That was at the heat of the, you know, Pam got the fucking.  The hep.  The hep.  And did she get it from Tommy Lee?  And what does Tommy Lee have to say about it?  So we were asking him about it.  Yeah, I want to talk about my fucking rap album.  That no one bought, by the way.  No.  Now that we have time on our side, we can go back and realize that that was a major 
[01:54:00]  bust.  We have to show positivity.  And as the interview proceeded, will you stop talking like you're in court?  Yes.  Tommy Lee needs to put so much water under the bridge and not over the child.  Fuck it up, guys.  I fucking hate Diddy's Twitter.  But that, but that, but that, but that you were told bullshit.  Yeah.  So that's what Chris Brown is pulling here. 
[01:54:30]  That's why we're bringing it up.  Yeah.  That there were talking points.  We agree that it's the, you were told.  He's a liar, liar.  And they went outside the boundaries of that.  But GMA saying that is bullshit.  But why do you need that?  Chris Brown continuing.  I was kind of thrown off.  I was thrown off by, and you know, I felt like it was like, okay, they told us this.  You know, that's what I thought, you know, and so I took it very, very hard, you know,  and I really, I kind of kept my composure throughout the whole interview, you know, although  you can see me upset, you know, I kept my composure, did my performance, and when I got back, I 
[01:55:00]  just let off, it's like steam in the back, you know, I didn't, didn't physically hurt  anyone.  I didn't, I didn't try to hurt anyone.  I just wanted to release, just the anger that I had inside me, because I felt like I  worked so hard for this music, and I love my fans, and I love to be able to make positive  music that I felt like people kept just trying to take it away from me, take it away from  me.  So, yes, I got very emotional.  No one's trying to take anything away from you.  You're an idiot.  Your positivity, no one, you beat the shit out of your girlfriend, it made you more famous,  you're a good singer, they're going to always ask about you beating the shit out of your 
[01:55:30]  broad.  You don't want to get asked about that?  Then don't punch her in the face, despite the fact she probably did deserve it.  She does have a punchable face.  Fuck!  He'll be asked that five years from now, no matter what he's doing.  Yes.  You dope, you punched her in the face.  What a dumb...  Dumb Inus asks us sex for Sam questions.  Of course.  Jesus.  He's so not likable.  Diddy had a good one.  Here's a good one by Diddy. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  About to have dinner with the kids.  God is great.  Really?  Why don't you say Allahu Akbar?  Fucking cares.  I'm sure there's some people in Japan that don't feel that way.  Exactly.  God's great, because why?  You can have dinner with your kids?  Yeah.  Right.  People that can't have dinner around the world, they're Diddy.  I take care of my kids.  I got blown.  God is great.  That'd be a fucking better tweet.  Just had my ass eaten for the first time.  Christ rules.  Why don't you tweet that later, please? 
[01:56:30]  It'll make all of us giggle, because we'll know where it came from.  Massage therapist jerked me off and got two knuckles deep.  Jesus.  Praise Buddha.  Yes, I got very emotional, and I apologize for acting like that.  And I want to tell Team Breezy as well, if you love me, if you love, you know, the whole  movement we're doing, all the music that I'm putting out, please, please know that everybody  is beautiful, you're beautiful.  A couple pops on show.  You know, Robin Roberts, you know, do not sing in threads, any of these things, but kind  of be a movement after this turkey chili. 
[01:57:00]  We don't need that.  We, as a movement, move as positive people.  We love everybody.  Really?  You know, us as a generation of kids and adults.  You know, we need to take a stand and be more positive and kind of focus on the real  issues in life and the real positive side of things.  So, you know.  Right.  So that's where we at.  So right now, it's all about the album, and we're moving forward.  You know what, I'm going to pass on getting my positivity from Chris Brown.  Anyone else with me?  Yeah.  I think I'm going to pass on that one.  I'll find somebody else to get positivity from.  I can understand if something happened where he was accused of doing something, he absolutely 
[01:57:30]  didn't do it, and was exonerated, and people keep harping on it.  I can see him going, look, stop talking about this shit.  But he did belt his chick in the face, and that's something now he has to live with.  He can't brush it off as positivity.  What's he talking positivity when he belts someone?  Shut up.  You're not positive.  You're a violent man.  You have an anger fucking problem.  Listen to me yelling about someone's anger problem.  Exactly.  And he tried to...  I'm a yelling. 
[01:58:00]  You have a gun.  I don't know.  I'm always yelling.  And he has people around him that changed his image.  Yeah.  He's got blonde hair now.  I think he got a bunch of tattoos.  I'm not positive about that one.  And now it's like, look, go out there and say, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  We have this positivity movement happening.  Shut up.  Shut up is right.  Just own up to the fact that you're fucking punched in the face.  Yeah.  So yeah, I belted the girl.  Fuck it.  Fuck it?  Speaking of positivity...  You got one?  Who's this from?  Our next guest.  Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah, let's get him in here. 
[01:58:30]  Oh my God, yes.  And it's Sam Back.  Sam Back, because our old friend is talking about us.  Yeah, Scorch.  Scorch.  P-F-G TV.  P-F-G TV.  P-F-G TV.  And from what I hear, Scorch might not be so happy with us.  Have you watched any P-F-G TV lately?  I can't stop watching it.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Brutal.  Yeah.  Where's Sam, man?  Because he brought this audio to our attention.  He has plans for a certain New York radio duo.  I believe that's us, because we beat him up pretty good. 
[01:59:00]  You know what the best thing about P-F-G TV is?  He's doing this show, and he's just doing a bad impression of other talk shows, like  Letterman.  He thinks he's the next Letterman.  Well, that's just it, but it's a bad impression.  He doesn't know how to just bring a whole new concept, or just bring yourself to a show  and do it.  Right.  So he's trying to do this Carson thing, or Letterman, or Conan, and it's just awful. 
[01:59:30]  We should say this, because I don't know where Sam is.  And Nick's not going to care about this.  Nick!  Nick!  Do you have anything else?  I love your fucking tweets, Nick, by the way.  I fucking love them.  I'm dropping a few.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  No, not a lot, which is good.  You're not a fucking crazy tweet or something, but when you do, it's fucking right to the  point.  I got in a fight with my wife one night, and I went downstairs.  I couldn't sleep, and then I just started putting some shit out there, and all of a sudden  the thing went wild.  My web guy goes, what did you put up there last night?  Some tweet bombs.  I actually took a few of them down.  Oh, really? 
[02:00:00]  You got to go, oh, shit.  Maybe that was too much.  Oh, yeah.  There's a new app that, actually, Andy Levy turned me on to.  What is it?  It's called Last Night Never Happened.  Ooh.  It's a new app, and here's what it does.  You have your Facebook, your Twitter, there's a couple of other things, and you turn this  on, then you hit continue, right?  And then you put in your information, and if you wake up and realize, oh, my God, I was 
[02:00:30]  fucking drunk, and I tweeted a bunch of shit, and I put in pictures and everything, it'll  tell you everything.  You set a certain time, and it'll tell you everything you posted on Facebook and Twitter  and shit from the time you put in until now.  And it'll show you exactly what it was, and you hit one button, and it deletes every fucking  thing that you put up.  Yeah, but I thought when you put something out there, it was out there forever.  Well, it usually is.  If someone retweets it, it'll be, and what that's like, with us, we have a lot of people  following.  Jimmy just smashed Sam's crackers, which is ironic. 
[02:01:00]  It makes me laugh every time.  Oh, it was chili you eat.  I came in, I thought it was like B.O.  Yeah, I know, right?  Coleman smells like a fucking immigrant worker.  It really does.  That's from the eggs we had earlier.  No, it's a Coleman, which smells just like body odor.  You got anything on Chris Brown there?  I think he's a fine gentleman and a great musician.  I don't know why you guys are beating up on him.  I know.  What's the matter with him?  He's a positive role model for all the kids out there.  A lot of positivity.  What a fucking, but I hear Robin Roberts.  Is there anything more politically correct than morning television? 
[02:01:30]  These dumb liberal cunts that just, she goes, oh, but we'd still have him back.  This is after the last incident.  So what are you going to do not to get invited back to your show?  What, have conservative views, you dumb lesbian?  Exactly.  Fucking he, she, one-titted.  Holy Toledo.  What did I say?  You're going to take us down with you.  Take that one back.  Well, I thought this was serious radio.  What's it turn it to?  Gay radio?  Well, I don't know, Nick. 
[02:02:00]  Well, occasionally.  Yeah, well, down the hall.  Oh, is that right?  In the bathroom.  Like I was saying, she's a role model, and he's a role model.  We don't know who we could get away with these days.  Is that right?  It's like, the fucked up thing is, he, yeah, right?  Well, join the club.  I thought I was going to make the audition for an opening over here.  Join the club.  It's, he obviously has a violence problem.  He belts his fucking chick, and then he goes into the dressing room and he rips that apart,  and they'll have him back. 
[02:02:30]  That's what she, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, like, what the fuck?  How many chances?  Why?  I think if regular, like, let's say Mel Gibson went on there and went into the dressing room.  Right, thank you.  And they were asking him about all kinds of shit about the controversy that he's been in,  and he went in the dressing room and ripped the fucking thing apart.  They would be, oh, we will never have him back.  Crazy right-wing anti-semite.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  But if you're a black guy, they go like, well, it's expected.  Mel Gibson was using the language he used. 
[02:03:00]  It wasn't what he did.  It's never what you do.  You can beat your girlfriend up.  You can fucking strike, do what you want physically.  It depends where you're on the food chain in show business.  But if you say the wrong stuff and it's caught, that's it.  Well, you know what you're talking about.  Yeah, of course.  When Charlie Sheen went there, I went, oh.  But wait a minute now.  Is he getting another crap?  I think he's getting another shot at it.  Well, then that just blows that theory out of the water.  I think he's getting another shot.  Because he went right into the Old Testament.  But it was through a text.  Right into the Old Testament. 
[02:03:30]  He really did.  Holy shit.  He did.  Yeah, yeah.  And you don't do that.  And you rarely resurface from that.  It was a text that he said he didn't send.  There's plausible deniability.  There's a little bit.  But didn't he say it verbally?  No.  No, no, no.  He was just calling him the guy by his Hebrew name.  Yeah.  But I thought he dropped one.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, I thought he dropped it.  Oh, maybe if he did, I didn't know it.  No, you might be right.  What, a K?  One of the K words.  Was there a reading from the Holy Book according to Zucker? 
[02:04:00]  Holy shit.  I saw you on Hannity the other night.  Bang.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, good old Hannity with that.  But you're really.  He's right there.  He's Claire.  You're destroying somebody next to you.  I was laughing my balls up.  I was trying to.  That liberal bitch next to me.  Who was it?  She wouldn't shut up.  It's Al Palen.  No.  Yeah, she just kept yapping and yapping.  I forget who it was.  No, it was a person. 
[02:04:30]  No, I'm trying to remember who the fuck that was.  I know.  What's her name?  Jedediah.  She was on the far side.  You ripped her shreds.  Yeah, she just, it's like, just stop with fucking Obama and no matter what he does, it's good  and right and he's made the perfect decisions.  Shut up.  It really is embarrassing, isn't it?  The guy is a weakling as far as an American president goes.  He's like Carter was.  Carter decimated the power of this country and it took Ronald fucking Reagan to bring it 
[02:05:00]  back.  To bring it back.  We were actually willing back then to go, I think we're going to go and vote for Reagan.  If you remember, a vote for Reagan was a vote for war.  Like it was Armageddon.  It was going to be a nuclear war if Reagan got elected.  The bombing starts in 10 minutes.  In 10 minutes.  Yes.  What?  How do you not love a guy who says that?  During a semi-col war.  Check one, two.  The bombing, the Soviet Union's been outlawed.  The bombing starts in 10 minutes.  But then meanwhile, the Soviet's like, what did he just fucking say?  Their fingers are on the button.  And where did he say that? 
[02:05:30]  And what was it?  At the height of the Cold War.  Yeah.  It was before a speech or a press conference and he was testing the mic out.  The mic was.  Instead of check one, two, he called a fucking atomic missile strike on the Soviet Union.  Yeah.  He was just busting balls.  It was the funniest thing.  Because I was just a comic guy.  I just started Stitches in Boston.  And Barry Crimmins is a hardcore liberal and a funny guy.  But he ran, you know, he went on about that.  Yeah.  He's a fucking warmongering cogsucker.  It took that, though, to bring the United States back to a position of power in the world 
[02:06:00]  because it was a joke.  Now it's becoming a joke again.  We're not.  And I've said this many times.  I don't mean Americans should be the world police and go everywhere and fucking clean up  everyone's goddamn mess.  I agree.  But you've got to.  When our interests are concerned, I love when people go, it's about oil or it's about this.  It's about.  It's about our interests.  We run on fucking oil.  We shouldn't fight for it sometimes.  That's how the world works.  Yes.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Every country acts on their own interests.  The second the Sudan has something we need, maybe we'll help those poor fellas out.  But for right now. 
[02:06:30]  How else would we make clit hats?  The largest exporter of fucking involuntarily removed clitorises.  Do you need a vagina that a branch has been shoved into?  We have a box of those we could send you.  A box.  How about some hacked off arms?  But you weren't for oil.  Yeah.  Sorry.  We need it.  So we have to keep some type of relationships with some of these countries.  We've got to fight some.  We've got to do that.  But he is such a weak president that he's not willing to make any kind of stand.  Even an unpopular one with his own constituency. 
[02:07:00]  He doesn't know what to do.  He's powerless.  You said it right.  Bookworm.  You're right.  He's a bookworm.  He's a constitutional law professor.  Right.  Right.  And he's never had to meet a payroll.  He's never.  Nope.  And it was all said by the right during the campaigns.  And it was all true.  And he's totally out of his league.  It's fucking embarrassing.  He wasn't a governor.  He was only a senator.  For 144 days.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  One of you guys might have pointed out that he never had somebody's life in his hands.  But governors at least have that.  That's right.  That's right.  He never ran the police force.  None of that.  He never had to do any of that.  And his domestic policy stinks on ice.  And he's got no foreign policy whatsoever.  He's got no foreign policy.  He's got none.  The first thing he did was hop on Air Force One on the apology tour.  I said he should have just painted I'm sorry on the bottom of Air Force One.  And low fly over the Middle East.  Yeah, but he'd be too fast to read it.  Oh, I know. 
[02:08:00]  Put some of the flaps down and go slow.  When he first got elected, I go, you know, he has no foreign policy experience.  I think he played risk in high school twice.  That was the extent of his fucking...  And then they go with, you know, launching the cruise missiles.  And it seemed to come out of nowhere.  Like, Bush was criticized so much about what he did in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But when you look at the time that went by between the first inkling that we wanted to go in somewhere  and the time the first bomb started falling, everyone was consulted.  People had time to bitch and moan and yell and agree and disagree. 
[02:08:30]  This was like, oh, we don't even know who these fucking rebels are.  But let's bomb the shit out of Gaddafi with a few million dollars worth of cruise missiles  and not know an exit strategy, an endgame, nothing.  It was a classic case, looking back on it, that election between him and McCain.  It's a classic case of affirmative action.  You had a white guy who was overqualified for a job.  A black guy was under...  But let's give the black guy a shot.  Give him the shot.  That was...  It's a classic case. 
[02:09:00]  It's a vote for change.  It was a vote for change.  And that change, by the way, is sending our military to a Middle East nation  to remove a tyrannical leader to help the people maybe form a democracy.  There's some change we can believe in, Obama.  The Republicans fucked up, though, by getting...  They overestimated Hillary's.  They wanted to get a woman because they thought that that would counterbalance...  You know, that was a bad blunder by them, getting Palin is what cost him the election.  I think McCain would have won if he had somebody else.  Maybe Mitt Romney or somebody else.  Yeah, I wouldn't argue with that.  And by the way, when people go, oh, no matter what Obama does, it's going to be wrong with you. 
[02:09:30]  Like, if he did go to war, didn't go to war.  I'm not even saying that.  Fuck him doing what he's doing.  It's the fact that he doesn't know how to do any of this stuff.  He's not a leader.  He's not a world leader.  He's looking to fucking off the troops and go, yeah, we'll stick around and stuff, but  we won't...  Maybe the French should be in charge of this.  You're going to hide behind the French and scurry.  The French?  Give me a break.  He's got more balls than our president.  Yeah.  When did you ever think you'd see that?  I guess they're in it for oil.  That's the theory on the France.  But who isn't? 
[02:10:00]  So what?  They fucking shoved their planes over Libya so fast.  It's like the second it was like, I think we ought to have a no-fly...  They go fucking French jets.  Kadhafi looks like Jeff Ross in some pictures, you know?  Like when Jeff Ross is hot and over.  A little bloated.  Doesn't he?  He's a little tired and bloated.  That's nice.  People love me.  Oh, that's good.  Some pictures he looks all right, but some he looks...  That would be great.  Someone at a podium just looking at him.  And Kadhafi. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, that would be...  I could have saved that one for a roast that I won't be invited to ever.  They do roast still?  I've heard of that.  Oh, shit.  Tell me about it.  Can you tell me what this is?  That's why I haven't talked in five minutes.  Ew, it's a tampon strip when you're chilling.  That's actually a scrotum.  You're holding a scrotum.  We all got chili.  Nice, delicious turkey chili.  And mine came with what looks like dental floss.  What is it?  It looks like a turkey yo-yo.  I'm glad you got the one with the shit in it.  What is it?  I'm glad yours had the fucking scrotum.  Is this a piece of meat?  No, I think it's...  It looks like on a pepper.  It's part of the thing from a pepper. 
[02:11:00]  No, it's dental floss.  It's protein.  Could be a rat's head.  Don't.  Yeah, enjoy it.  So you...  Is it dental floss?  What do you think?  It looks like the skin from the pepper.  Like that perfectly?  For the people that know...  What?  Like, peel it off.  Is it attached to anything?  Or does it just come right out?  Uh-oh.  That's dental floss in my chili.  That shit's going in the garbage.  See?  No, it's not dental.  What are you thinking?  It does look like dental floss.  Probably a piece of string that is tying the meat up. 
[02:11:30]  Whatever the meat is.  Oh, whatever that meat is.  Raccoon leg.  I ate the whole thing.  Jesus, I scraped the bottom.  My spoon actually went...  Chili.  You don't give a shit, right?  Chili.  I try not to eat much of it, Nick, but you know how once in a while...  What's wrong with chili?  The boys are getting turkey chili.  What's wrong with chili?  I'm trying to lose weight.  Wow, that is Jeff Floss, by the way, Nick DiPaolo.  What did I tell you?  How's that for a call?  Wow.  That's a good call.  Right there.  That deserves a plug.  Governors, Levitatown, Long Island, March 25th and 26th, this weekend. 
[02:12:00]  And then next weekend, Uncle Vinny's on Staten Island.  Nice.  But then the Playboy Club in Vegas on April, what, 7 through 9?  Yes.  Wait, you're at Governors this weekend?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I'm going to stop now.  Go ahead.  That's like my neck of the woods.  It's very close.  That's my neck of the woods.  Who are you working with?  Joe List.  I've got a kid that opens for me.  It'll be good.  I need more ice, Kenny.  Joe List.  What does he put his name on?  Oh, Jesus.  Worked with his brother shit last week. 
[02:12:30]  Hello.  Hello.  That's my new hook.  Remember the guy that used to go hamburger?  Do you remember the black comic?  No.  Hamburger.  Yeah, after every joke, he'd go hamburger.  Really?  Oh, now we've got to find that one.  Do you know his name?  Holy shit.  He went by hamburger.  Hamburger.  I guess his name.  I think I know his nickname.  I used to see him on evening.  Evening at the Apollo.  Hamburger.  I don't remember that.  Shit.  That's an awful hook.  Hamburger. 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  I don't know.  Black.  Older black guy.  Older black guy.  Yeah, you found a black, white, Jewish guy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, well, hold on.  Someone's very tired of something you say to me.  All right.  Let's go to Rich in Florida.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Jim, I just want to let you know it didn't matter.  Sarah Palin didn't cause McCain to lose.  McCain lost because he didn't have conservative Republican support.  Give you an example.  In Georgia, where I live, we had to have a runoff during the election with a senator, 
[02:13:30]  a Republican senator.  He didn't get enough votes against a Democratic candidate in Georgia that won 60% of, that  McCain won 60% of the vote of.  However, during the runoff election, Sarah Palin came down and campaigned for him, and  he won 80% of the vote.  Maybe that's true, but the bottom line is this, and it's not even a knock on Palin.  She was abysmal in interviews.  And again, I know a lot of it was the media painting her a certain way, but she came off 
[02:14:00]  looking like a dope, and she came off looking like, because of his age, God forbid, we were  looking at the VP on that one a lot more than you looked at Biden on Obama, because he's  younger.  Right.  And if he fucking died...  The cancer spots on his forehead?  Yeah.  You wanted to know who was in charge.  Foreshadowing what's going on.  She cost him the election.  The perception was that she was terrible, and that she was not qualified.  But Jimmy, you know what?  He was losing...  He was actually...  You know, his numbers went up as soon as he appointed her. 
[02:14:30]  Maybe among certain Republicans.  But that's like saying the conservatives would have voted for Obama before they voted, who's  not just...  He's a liberal Democrat.  They would not have voted for him before they voted for McCain.  I firmly believe she cost him the election.  I was going to say, Jim, I don't think it mattered who he got...  If he would have got Jesus as his running mate, pretty much they would have...  Is it a Jewish fella?  No way, not in Florida.  Spanish.  They would have said the Jews made a... 
[02:15:00]  Maybe the Jews had it right.  But, I mean, there's just one of them things I don't think he could have...  Hearing that accent and him saying the Jews, it's just like...  It really...  Doesn't it just...  Isn't there an uncomfortable thing going on right there?  You know, the Jews...  It depends on your political views.  Jesus.  Do you think it was because the day people were so sick of Bush after eight years that  they were just going to get a Democrat in there?  It was Bush remorse.  I mean...  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  Yeah, thanks to the complicit left-wing media.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't see him fucking doing anything now, really. 
[02:15:30]  I don't see him fucking...  It's amazing what Obama can get away with.  It's just amazing what he can get away with in the media.  Well, they have no scruples on the left.  They have no anchor to their views.  No.  They're really...  Seriously.  They're fucking baseless.  Where's the anti-war protests?  Where's the get our men out of Libya protests?  I don't think you're going to be seeing that.  Where's the Obama with the Hitler mustache and fucking, you know, a little Nazi hat and 
[02:16:00]  swastikas and...  You're never going to see that.  I thought I saw one of the Tea Party rally.  Out of 70 million people, I saw one.  Oh, God, those racists.  Isn't that hilarious?  Those racists.  Thank you, Kenny.  You heard me.  Yeah.  Some ice.  That's right.  Get me some Melba toast and a hat.  And a hat.  More importantly, we got the name of that comic.  Alonzo Hamburger Jones.  There you go.  Alonzo Hamburger Jones.  I got to hear Alonzo Hamburger Jones.  And he's got a brother who does a hamburger helper. 
[02:16:30]  When this guy sits at Gallagher, too, this guy steps in a breach.  I love this hill.  You hear Gallagher's got to sell his fucking house?  Because of his medical bills?  All those years doing comedy and he can't even keep his house.  Why is that?  Bill Burr is blaming the banks.  Because he spent half his money on fruit.  He said the fucking banks.  He wouldn't smash the shit every time.  He plays the stock market big time and he's good at it.  So maybe he lost money doing that.  Oh, maybe he's not that good at it.  Maybe during that stock market thing.  Yeah.  He got killed.  Dude, Bill's...  Maybe Bill's right.  But I mean, he should know... 
[02:17:00]  Gallagher should know better.  I sat and watched him for an hour.  He was a genius with day trading and stuff.  Really?  Maybe he just fucked up.  You watched him where?  Like Charles Scobb?  No, we interviewed him.  And then after that, he was sitting there.  Oh, he went to a computer and just like logged on.  No, no, no, no.  He sat in the hall on a laptop.  Yeah, yeah.  For hours, Nick.  Because he didn't want to go back to a shitty hotel  because he doesn't get good hotels when he's on the road.  So he hangs out at the radio station with a laptop  and day trades on the floor.  He's a strange guy.  Love him.  I guess he might have taken a hit, huh?  That's kind of ironic because he's like a hippie type 60s guy. 
[02:17:30]  I mean, capitalism's good now.  Yeah, the establishment kind of working.  Now that he's selling out, yeah.  Here we go, guys.  We got Alonzo Hamburger Jones.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Together.  Well, Alonzo Hamburger Jones.  Hamburger.  Oh, I've never seen him years ago.  This almost looks coming.  Oh, shit.  I like him already.  Look how he's drunk. 
[02:18:00]  They're yelling Hamburger.  It's the typical catchphrase comic.  They're yelling Hamburger.  Oh, shit.  I think he gets a big applause the first time he said that.  Oh, yeah.  I think they lose their shit.  Look, he's just wearing a cowboy hat.  Yeah, what the hell is that?  Hamburger.  Oh, my God.  Joke, I wonder what you just have.  A Halloween?  Like a hamburger going to deliver mail or something. 
[02:18:30]  What's up with you?  You're overweight.  That's your problem.  Can't take a joke?  I know you take an order of fries by the way, couldn't you?  Hamburger.  Look at his feet.  Feet so big.  He likes to spell Nickelodeon.  Look at that.  Hold on.  This is like a bit.  Hamburger.  You give me a bad name.  Take that hat off.  This is an SNL bit, isn't it?  Are you hungry?  Yeah.  It has to be.  They did it last week.  They didn't make you a big behind feel at home.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hamburger. 
[02:19:00]  Who are you supposed to be?  Oh, that's your fucking sense.  I got news for you.  Never going to get it.  Never going to get it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Hamburger.  Who are you supposed to be?  A Jamaican parking attendant.  Mujakar.  Mujakar.  Mujakar.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it loud.  Come on.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Hamburger.  I ain't going to have this.  Yeah.  When I was coming up, I always wanted to be a radio guest.  I don't get this. 
[02:19:30]  You know one of them smooth-talking guys you hear like 7 o'clock in the morning on the radio?  Good morning.  Welcome to the station, WAKJ.  16.94.  You're a.m. doll.  The great songs to play.  Day in and day out.  I'm the one, Mr. Jones.  Rocky.  From 7 to 10 each every morning.  Now for the weather report.  Partly Klein is gone.  Side of the day about 58.  Tonight is low about 46.  And for tomorrow, we'll just have to wait and see.  Hamburger.  Hey, let me give you the top pick hits for this week.  Coming to number three is that smash hit, I Don't Want to See Anymore, by Ray Charles  and Stevie Wonder.  I see that blind, Jimmy.  Did you get that?  Did you get it?  No, I didn't.  Once you got it. 
[02:20:00]  Say it.  Say it.  What ear is it?  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  I remember.  Thank you.  Number two.  Go Away, Little Boy, by Michael Jackson.  Oh, shit.  You didn't go there.  Oh, shit.  Fuck.  Say it.  And holding strong at number one for five weeks straight is that smash hit, Ring My Bell,  by the Jehovah Witnesses.  Say it.  Hamburger.  Arrested development.  They need to be arrested.  Arrested.  Kidding that old man.  Putting his behind the group. 
[02:20:30]  You can tell you don't want to be in the group.  Every time you see him, he try to get his way.  It's like.  Say it.  Hamburger.  No, he'll save for us.  MC Light, how about you want a roughneck?  No, I guess not.  Give him a roughneck today.  Next week, we'll go behind one on a restraining order.  Hamburger.  Come on.  This is like mellow for a.  Hamburger.  Ah, shell like rap music from the old.  I don't get why he says Hamburger.  I think it's an OCD thing.  It's just his timing.  It's his cadence.  Hey, do you have Voss on Def Jam? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, no.  He's not even here.  But did you ever see that?  I was at that taping.  This isn't fair.  He's not even here.  March for Ball.  Why does he say Hamburger?  I don't know.  That was infuriating to watch.  March for Ball.  Hamburger.  I'm glad, yes.  Absolutely.  Ready for your next act, see, yeah?  Yeah.  This brother right here has appeared on Showtime at the Apollo, and he is here tonight to make history. 
[02:21:30]  You'll see what I mean.  Y'all show your love for Rich Voss.  Come on, y'all.  Rich Voss on Def Jam.  That mediocre applause.  It's more than he deserves.  Oh, boy.  You're like a white guy invading this?  Uh, a lot of sisters in the house checking me out, huh?  Oh, boy.  Remember, once you go white, you go right back to black. 
[02:22:00]  Hamburger.  Shit, I'm not like the brothers.  I'll eat the coochie, okay?  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  My sister used to go out with a black guy.  I said, what's up with that?  She said, once you go black, you never go back.  I go, that's because our family won't let you in.  Ah, shit.  He's strutting.  Loosen up.  Hamburger. 
[02:22:30]  Can't we all get along?  Until I get in my car and get the fuck out of here.  We got the white girl over there going, oh, he's going to start shit.  White people, we need to riot tonight.  Me and you, baby.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's rincing.  He's wearing a Fat Farm sweatshirt.  Yeah.  He's 51.  Shit, white people don't have to riot.  Shit.  We steal lumber.  And dope teeth. 
[02:23:00]  Honey, look at all this plywood I got.  Where the Spanish folks?  Where the Spanish folks?  There you go.  Why is he doing that?  You ever been over to a Spanish person's house?  They got more furniture than a fucking furniture store.  Furniture.  Couch is all over the place.  He is killing.  Motherfuckers are killing.  A fire escape into a balcony.  Motherfuckers.  Pause that for a second.  Who's the man?  Oh.  I don't like hearing Ritz talk black. 
[02:23:30]  I know Ritz talking black.  It's hard enough to hear him try to talk white.  How long ago is it?  Two weeks.  No, that was...  Me and Eric McMahon went to that taping.  He really is doing like a...  Yeah, let me tell you.  I'm going to guess 97.  He's aged pretty damn good.  Yeah, he really has.  He doesn't look much different.  Christ, that's 14 years ago?  Maybe, maybe 99.  Mentally, he's gotten dumber.  I wish he was...  I never thought I'd say that.  I wish Voss was here so I could ask him what year that was.  You're probably about right.  Probably about 98.  Yeah, he doesn't look much different. 
[02:24:00]  His teeth are different.  No, he looks good.  Oh, we're calling him?  Yeah, it's just...  Oh, here's where he gets really down.  Oh, yeah.  You ever see a Spanish drive-by?  Get the car closer so I can cut him.  That's a good joke.  Yeah, I don't like that one.  Friendberger!  You know...  You know, Jesus was Spanish.  Jesus was Spanish, brother.  I swear to God, because I read in the Bible, it said, 
[02:24:30]  Jesus will come back like a thief in the night.  Oh, yeah.  And he's doing like that.  That's what Bill O'Reilly's sniffing.  Yeah.  I just want to give a shout-out.  We got a celebrity in the house up there, Angela Davis.  How you doing, baby?  See, that's what I do when we're serious militants,  like Stokey Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver,  Huey Newton, Bobby Seale.  Name more, Scooby.  They have a great message.  Get Whitey. 
[02:25:00]  Whitey's holding us back.  Whitey's taking our jobs.  I don't know who this guy Whitey is,  but we got to catch him.  Yeah.  Are you enjoying it?  Yeah, I don't like it.  Like, it would be great if he was just...  I love working a black audience.  I'm telling you, man.  White audiences are cool.  You know, it's money's money.  But black audiences give it up.  It's money.  When I leave a black club, 
[02:25:30]  I go to my car,  there's like 2,000 flyers on my car.  Black people will promote anything.  Rasheem's graduating.  Flyer.  He is killing us.  Yes, he is.  Get a fucking great set.  Barbecue at Gerald Kelly's.  Flyer.  Gerald Kelly's.  Money's money.  It's money.  It's money.  I just want to say,  I love carrying the message. 
[02:26:00]  I just celebrated 10 years  by the drug we're drinking my body.  Sober by the grace of God.  How old is this?  Thank you.  About a lot of years ago.  It works if you work it.  It works if you work it.  And I don't need to get high now  because I've got gambling to fall back on.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Them numbers, the lotteries.  Who plays the numbers here?  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  Why people play the numbers the best?  The best.  One runs off, gets hit by a car.  They're always going,  what was that license plate number?  I'm playing it. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  So the boobie got shot six times  on 4th Street at 2 o'clock.  6-4-2.  Wheel the motherfucker.  There is nothing worse  than when you go to play the numbers  that have someone work in a lottery machine  that don't speak English.  That don't speak English.  I went today, I said to the guy,  I said, 6-2-8.  He went, 6-3-8?  No stupid 6-2-8,  but play 6-3-8 
[02:27:00]  in case it comes out now, okay?  He's wonderful.  He's precious as mother.  He's spitting his fucking eye.  He's gone and gone and gone.  He did have a good set.  He done good.  He did well.  How long ago?  Because he said 10 years sober?  10 years.  Now I'm trying to think.  I'm sober 24 years.  He's a little longer than...  It's at least 14 years ago.  Wow.  At least.  So yeah, 97-ish.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he really looks the same.  Was he living in Patterson then?  No, in Plainfield.  He's from Plainfield. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know.  He was...  But didn't he live in Patterson?  Oh, maybe.  Hear what I'm saying, motherfucker?  I'm Rich Voss, bitch.  Money.  Money.  Motherfucker.  It's money.  It's money.  Yeah.  It's money, yo.  What does it mean, Rich?  I don't know.  It's money, yo.  Well, to him, it means something different.  And Dave's saying hamburger instead of cursing.  That's why he does that.  Hamburger.  Instead of going, ah, shit.  Motherfucker.  Ah, shit.  I'd rather have him say twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That hamburger was infuriating. 
[02:28:00]  How do you know that, though, Nick?  Where'd you see him?  Because I used to watch.  That was like a...  That was your thing, huh?  Evening of the Apollo?  What was it called?  That was Def Jam.  Def Jam.  And then the Apollo was Evening of the Apollo.  And me and my buddy down in Florida used to crack up at these guys that have the, you  know...  The catchphrases.  Catchphrases.  The catchphrases.  Those fuckers make a lot of money, though.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Is there any other catchphrase guys out there?  Pocket lint is a big one.  Pocket lint.  Pocket lint.  I used to go, nutswit.  They did an SNL sketch, like, last weekend. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was really funny.  The catchphrases.  Yeah, the catchphrases.  I got a taste of that if you want.  More from the...  Pocket lint.  That's a good one.  Pocket lint.  This is what Nick is referring to.  It's cheese.  We just happen to have it in front of us today.  The kings are back.  And they're dusting off all your old favorite bits, like Eatin' Dookie.  Did you ever come home and catch your wife Eatin' Dookie talking about, put this Dookie  in my hand?  You did, you nasty-ass bitch.  Be jealous.  Kicked in the Johnson.  I tell you, I'm no luck with American women. 
[02:29:00]  I offer them a cruchetti.  They kick me straight in my Johnson.  Ooh, funky boy.  Big dogs, breakfast.  I can't get an Eggie McMuffin because it's 10.35.  Flappy, bappy, wait, wait.  And New York versus L.A.  I kind of want to have one of those.  We got to break into this bit because Rich Voss is on the phone.  Rich?  What?  Hi, Rich.  Yo, what's up, man?  Yeah, yo, Rich. 
[02:29:30]  What's up, money?  Yo, what's up?  What's up, money?  You know what Black Comet really had it tough was an earthquake after Haiti.  He couldn't work anywhere.  He put his name on the marquee and people were just like, oh, really?  He's touring in Japan right now.  It was horrible.  Okay, let's start this fucking abuse.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  No one said about our show.  He already knows.  Yeah, but he can't be.  We can't be calling him for something good.  But we were listening to your Def Jam set. 
[02:30:00]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  First of all.  No, you killed.  Rich.  You killed.  You had a good set set.  You were fucking killing.  Okay.  You found your people.  You killed that motherfucker.  Let me just tell you the pressure first, and then we'll go into the fucking smashing.  All right, then.  First of all, the show was on for five years, and it was HBO's number one show at the time.  They never used a white comic, so.  You're a pioneer.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I hear what you're spraying.  No, hold on.  Look at that.  You're like Daniel Boone. 
[02:30:30]  Okay, play on words.  Anyhow, listen.  Yeah, that's called a joke.  Yeah.  Okay.  I can tell if that was Nick or Anthony.  Same thing.  Same person.  It really is the same person.  You're right on that.  Go ahead, now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Separated birthdays, too.  Only one successful.  Yeah.  They're like two peas outside of a pod of something.  Oh, Chip.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Pocket lit.  Hell butt.  Pocket lit.  Got it. 
[02:31:00]  Anyhow, anyhow, so many black comics were pissed that I was doing the show, and then white  comics were going, oh, you've got to do great.  You're the first one.  It was a lot of pressure, and they taped all week.  I was on the last show, second to last going on.  All the people that were taping all week were there.  It was just the most nerve-wracking.  It's like doing your fucking dumb show.  I was with you.  Where did you tape that, Rich?  Huh?  Where was it?  It was Harlem, right?  No.  No.  God, what a ring.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It was in Harlem.  No, it was in Watts. 
[02:31:30]  It was like some theater in New York.  I don't fucking know.  I don't remember that.  Did you buy the Fat Farm sweatshirt just for the gig?  No.  They made me wear that, because I went there with a...  I had like...  God, they bully you.  I had feelers.  I mean, I was dressed black.  Don't get me wrong.  Yeah.  But...  Wearing FUBU?  Yeah.  Fucking Russell Simmons.  You know, they go, you've got to wear this.  You know, to advertise this stupid fucking...  Why do you just wear something like a regular shirt?  Isn't that funny?  We do TV where they make us put a tape over the logo and hide shit.  Yeah.  We'll do more different rules, huh? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  So they made me wear that.  And, you know, well, okay, so let's go.  It's money.  It's money.  Well, yo, you know, you was doing good.  You did good.  You did good.  You were the best.  You were the best.  Did they force you to get your hair cut like that?  Yeah.  No, that's not my hair.  And they took out...  I had like some good bits like on Angela Davis and...  Sure.  Like, I mean, real good bits.  But they took those out.  You know, they edited...  Maybe because it was 40 years untopical at that point? 
[02:32:30]  No.  What else are you talking about?  Yo, man, Lincoln.  How about a hand for Lincoln, motherfuckers?  Yo, I took the motherfucking railroad.  Y'all know which one?  Right.  We got it.  You know, black people.  Rich, Rich.  I don't know which one.  We were just curious.  Metro North.  Why did you fall into a black dialect?  You know, when you're at the casino, you start off with our gambling material.  But no, I don't mean the material.  I mean, like, what you were saying.  You was like, yeah, that's the best. 
[02:33:00]  You didn't say best.  You said, like, the best.  And you were like, that's money.  That's money.  He was going to say, when in Rome you do as the Romans do.  But he couldn't think of that.  So he said, when in a casino, you play cards.  When you're in a crackers factory, you buy sultines.  What, Rich?  When in Rome, you do as the South Americans do.  Isn't that where it is?  Yes.  When in Rome, you keep walking aimlessly.  It's harrowing.  First of all, it was 15 fucking years ago. 
[02:33:30]  And when I do look back on it, I really, really, truly wish I didn't fucking cater to that.  Okay?  Yeah.  Plus, you know, you make fucking mistakes in this business.  I guess you guys all look at each other and go, hey, we make a mistake every fucking day.  But I made mistakes every day you're in.  Oh, come on.  I'm teasing.  I love the Richard Voss.  That's true.  He's very good.  And you did.  You fucking killed.  Yeah, you did great.  Yeah, man.  You're a white guy.  And you had to win them over, too, because when you came out, they were like, oh, shit, 
[02:34:00]  what is this?  Yeah.  What is this?  Whatever.  Yeah, you blew it up.  I blew it up.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Leave Libby out of it.  All right.  Have we got anything else for Rich?  Yeah.  No, we just wanted to touch base.  What are you doing, Rich?  Where are you going to be?  You're going to hang up on me.  No, actually not.  No, I actually said it, and I don't, I never.  No, I'm in Vancouver.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I fucking drove to Seattle, drove up here, working three nights, four nights off, 
[02:34:30]  I'm going down to Pebble Beach.  Huh?  Pebble Beach?  Oh, that's why he rarely went out there.  No, no, no, no, no.  Depends on the golf course.  The baby needs new shoes.  Hamburger.  Hamburger.  Vancouver's a nice place, huh?  Beautiful.  Yes, I have.  I got blown in an alley there for my last hundred bucks in 1990.  I did ecstasy.  I did ecstasy with Doug Stanhope there.  Yeah?  Ended up going, you know, ended up going back to the hotel and fucking rubbing my own feet. 
[02:35:00]  It's fucking horrible.  You don't like the ecstasy?  It was Stanhope's birthday.  He's on stage.  He goes, who's got ecstasy?  Sure enough, he gets off stage, and the kid comes up like a white mohawk.  Yeah.  And he talked to me for like an hour.  I'm like, I don't do that shit.  I don't know.  You've got to stay in crowds after you do ecstasy.  I had like ten Heinekens in me.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  And Stanhope could probably talk in and doing drugs.  And he did.  You know?  Yeah.  That's great.  Holy shit.  I wish I could do more.  I can't remember if I had a girlfriend or not, so I'm trying to watch this bit. 
[02:35:30]  Rub your own feet.  I'm trying to watch this bit.  I do remember rubbing my own feet.  God, it feels amazing.  Imagine if I had some tits in my hands.  Fuck.  Rich.  All right, Rich.  Vancouver for Rich Voss.  See you, Rich.  You still on Twitter, by the way?  Yes.  Okay.  What's the matter, Rich?  You sound down.  This was a good experience.  Three hours earlier there.  He's in Vancouver.  Oh, that's true.  He's on high alert is what's the matter.  He thinks we're going to beat him up or hang up on him at any second.  Of course.  And I'm not calling you back at these prices. 
[02:36:00]  Rich, what club are you playing?  Laugh lines.  Yeah, they said the only bird gets the worm.  You're going to get the apple bean up this early.  I couldn't sleep, and what the fuck?  This is really uncomfortable, and I know I just, I, you know what?  Fuck it.  He can't take the pressure.  He thought we were going to trash him.  We had a barrel.  You guys really abuse him, huh?  Yeah, well, he does take some abuse on this show.  We were just actually trying to just be nice for once.  But he deals it back. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, he does.  Like, he's ruthless these days.  Like, for years, he kind of just sat there and kind of took it.  Now he's vicious on it.  I would never fly.  This is where I'm fucking.  I would never fly to fucking Vancouver to do comedy.  That is a long-ass flight.  The fuck?  He was in Seattle, though.  He's doing a little West Coast trip.  I'll make the same money.  I'll make the same money fucking driving to upstate New York in a fucking casino.  It's not showbiz.  It isn't.  Comedy club isn't showbiz. 
[02:37:00]  It's a fucking paycheck.  Right, Jay?  It's a job.  Theaters, I understand.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, if you was at a theater, you'd do that.  But I like it.  I haven't left.  I've been within a 60-mile radius in my house for the last year.  Guys.  But it's starting to pay off a little bit.  We have to do this.  Q in New Orleans.  Go ahead.  Q.  Yo, yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  There's another aggravating one.  He was on Def Comedy as well.  His name's Shucky Ducky.  Oh, Shucky.  Yes.  You know Shucky Ducky?  Is it the same thing as Hamburger? 
[02:37:30]  It's better than Hamburger.  No.  You're fine, motherfucking Shucky Ducky, motherfucker.  That's right.  You're fine, Shucky Ducky.  Good call, man.  Didn't Chris Rock mock him?  Hey, guys.  One other thing right quick.  I know this will probably aggravate Jimmy.  It's all outdoors.  Did you see they're making a remake of Arthur?  Yeah, we've talked about it many times on the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It drives us nuts.  Who's in it?  It looks horrible.  Russell Brandt, who's coming in to do our show.  Oh, it looks great.  And Ann's going to trash him right in front of his face.  I'm not going to trash him, huh?  I remember what you said yesterday.  Is he funny?  He's a cool guy.  Now, please break his balls. 
[02:38:00]  Break his balls.  Shucky Ducky.  I fucked up.  Shucky Ducky.  How could I forget about Shucky Ducky?  Shucky Ducky, motherfucker.  We found Shucky Ducky.  We're going to listen to Shucky Ducky.  Shucky Ducky.  I forgot about this guy.  How do these people not just shoot themselves?  And we've got Nikki Benz waiting in the way.  Oh.  We're going to take a break before we get her in.  Where'd that be?  Let's do a little Shucky Ducky first.  Shucky Ducky.  It's actually a good show.  I love Shucky Ducky.  I'd like to introduce someone to you who's been seen on Apollo.  I've happened to have seen him at a local nightclub. 
[02:38:30]  Is this the only clip we have?  That's for Shucky Ducky.  Maybe she's just talking low.  I will see.  Crank it.  Let me see him down here.  All right, y'all.  Shucky Ducky and I have.  Quack, quack.  We're going to have some fun.  I know y'all.  I've been out.  He's got nothing first.  Oh, shit.  I fell off the stage.  I should kill myself.  What's he, the college or something?  I got to get out of here and do something because, you know, I got to pay child support  next week.  Next week?  I ain't kidding.  You got to pay child support, boy.  I'm telling you.  I got a friend pay so much child support, he can't even get a partner. 
[02:39:00]  He got to sleep on the job.  The time you wake up, you punch it in.  Shucky Ducky, quack, quack.  Big brothers and sisters.  No fucking way.  My teeth itch.  My teeth itch.  Shucky Ducky, quack, quack.  I just want to hear Shucky Ducky, quack, quack now.  He looks like Malcolm X.  He does.  He really does.  Ernest Thomas.  People like that.  Wow.  We like that good comedy.  Malcolm X.  He's getting feedback.  Shucky Ducky. 
[02:39:30]  Going through the 180.  As-salamu alaykum.  Shucky Ducky.  Shucky Ducky.  Angry postal worker killed supervise and three other postal workers.  Uh-huh.  My cousin ran out the hat.  I said, where you going, man?  He said, I'm going to give me an application.  Shucky Ducky.  Crack, crack.  He got four news at the post office.  Come on.  Come on.  Say it right now.  Perfect spot.  Take it up, kid, boy.  Shit.  And I don't worry about no bills or nothing like that.  I don't worry about no bills.  Of course not.  I have a bill due since 1988.  Come call to my house, talking about, sir, you got a bill due since 1988. 
[02:40:00]  What you waiting on?  I said, seven years.  Seven years, they ain't got to pay nothing.  Talking about, well, sir, that's being irresponsible.  I said, no, that's being patient.  That's what that's being.  That's another word I got for it.  Come on.  Shucky Ducky.  That's another word I got.  Shucky Ducky.  Crack, crack.  We did not have.  We did not have.  I forgot about the quack, quack.  I used to drive the bus right here, dog.  Shucky Ducky, quack, quack.  In the house.  In the house.  In the house. 
[02:40:30]  I kept on passing up people on the bus stop.  Come on.  Give me one more.  I know.  Supervisor pulled me to the side.  I'm like, why do you keep on passing up people?  I said, shoot, you say stay on time.  Uh-huh.  She said, well, I start to pick up people.  I'm going to be late.  Thank God.  I'm kidding, boy.  I was scared to miss out of my passing.  They get on my bus, they're going to look like Wilma Flintstone.  When they get off, they're going to look like Don King, straight up in the air.  Yeah, we know.  One guy stopped and asked me, he said, hey, man, why do you have all those Garfield doors  in your window?  I said, those are not doors. 
[02:41:00]  Them passenger.  Them passenger.  Plural.  Concept of pluralization.  You better know what kind of money you got.  He needs more Shucky Duckies in his act, doesn't he?  He really does.  If you've got Shucky Duckie in your act, you've got to use it more.  You've got to use it more.  I'm not just fair.  Well, if he's killing, he would, you know.  He's waiting for the kill.  He pulled out all of his money.  Shucky Duckie, hack, hack.  It's a tough gig.  You pick that for me.  It's a tough gig for Shucky Duckie.  Come on.  Come on.  I picked out a 20, a 5, and 3 quarters. 
[02:41:30]  Come on.  And gave the man a transfer.  Yeah, come on.  He said, will this get me downtown?  I said, man, this will get you to Tokyo.  Come on.  Oh, Shucky Duckie, hack, hack.  Let me tell you all what Shucky Duckie is.  See, Shucky Duckie is this phrase that I created that means disappointment or excitement.  For example, instead of cursing, when you stomp with Tokyo, you say, Shucky Duckie.  Now, if you see a fine girl or a guy you like, you say, oh, Shucky Duckie.  Yeah, that'll get you.  Oh, wow.  Now, if you get to get a break, then you say, damn. 
[02:42:00]  Because you done shook your ducky too long.  Quack, quack in the hell.  Shucky Duckie.  Oh, he mixed it up.  Shucky Duckie.  I tried to get me a date man around here in Dallas.  Boy, I can't hardly get a date because I drive a wrong car.  How uncomfortable is this?  See, I drive a BMI.  Jimmy hasn't said a word.  That stands for better than me.  You're in shock, aren't you?  Yes, I am.  I think it's what Shucky has to do when there's a shootout in the hood.  I say, hey, man, you want to ride?  He said, no.  Shucky Duckie. 
[02:42:30]  He said, I'll wait for the garbage truck coming down the street.  That's what I did.  Then I picked up a date in my BMI.  This guy stole this from me.  Oh, he did?  I'm Chipper Dipper, oink, oink.  I said, yeah, but I need to get in on this side.  That's too funny.  I'm sorry.  That's too funny.  Janine is calling today audio clip punishment day.  Why, man?  This is funny.  Shucky Duckie, quack, quack.  Nick brought this to the show.  I love Shucky Duckie.  How did I forget Shucky Duckie?  Shucky Duckie.  Over him, man.

[02:44:00]  Oh, because it's Travis.  Can we bring the girl in?  Yes.  Where's Nicky Benz?  Bring in the girl.  Get Nicky Benz down here.  Get Nicky Benz.  What was she actually in?  I think Penthouse.  She was in Penthouse, right?  Penthouse.  She's the reigning Penthouse Pet of the Year.  Reigning Penthouse Pet of the Year.  She was supposed to do a pole dance for us.  And not like a Polish dance.  That would be boring.  Can you let her sit here and you sit there?  You motherfucker.  Now she's in between us.  Nice, Jimmy.  Nice. 
[02:44:30]  Jimmy.  You have no Nick a lot longer than Nicky Benz.  Exactly.  I've already fucked Nick.  And we knew we wouldn't be able to get the fucking stripper pole in here.  Wow.  Yeah, she spanked Roland last time she was in here, right?  Yeah, she certainly did.  Holy shit.  Look what she's wearing today.  She's wearing some skin-tight fucking number.  Nicky Benz back on the show.  I'm the only one clapping now.  I remember.  Hello, madam.  Hi.  Shucky-ducky-quack-quack.  Shucky-ducky-quack-quack-hamburger.  Hamburger.  Damn. 
[02:45:00]  How you doing, Nikki?  I'm doing really good.  How you doing?  Good.  We're a little disappointed.  I know.  I heard.  We wanted to see you on that pole.  Right.  Yeah.  You know how it is.  Well, I have an idea.  You do or you don't?  I was going to use Roland as a human pole.  A human pole?  How about a human barrel, maybe?  We'll see because he's rotund.  He's a little rotund.  Wow, you smell good.  You sure do.  That's Norton.  Oh, is that his farting fucking perfume now?  I dropped one before. 
[02:45:30]  Chanel No. 5 and shit.  Come on.  That's great.  I've come home smelling like that from the strip club a few times and had to explain it.  That's really good.  No, it was in Yankee Candle.  Exactly.  Couldn't find anything I wanted.  What else are you going to say?  That's pretty fucking funny.  You don't rub candles on your face.  I know, right?  My dick smells like Yankee Candle.  Yes.  I was in Yankee Candle and I ate sushi. 
[02:46:00]  Fuck, man.  Yankee chowder.  So, how you been?  Good?  I've been really good.  Yeah?  Just doing my thing with Penthouse.  Yeah.  Can I ask you something?  And don't worry, it's nothing bad.  Hi.  Ask me.  I've got to get to the bottom of something that has been bothering me for a really long time.  Now, you did Howard's show recently, which is fine.  Yeah.  No problem with that.  Was there any insertion that went on on his show?  No.  Are you just saying that?  No, no.  There was no insertion. 
[02:46:30]  No?  We heard fingers went up some girl's vagina.  Not mine.  And the only reason we're jealous is because we want to be doing the film.  We would love to do that.  There was no insertion.  I mean, no.  Okay.  Because we thought there was a double standard going on.  Yeah.  Because we used to do insertion things.  No.  She put her fingers up my ass.  I would like that.  And now I'm putting my fingers up the company's ass.  Actually, my entire foot, Robin.  Yeah.  If you guys want insertion, I have no problem with that.  Look at her.  All right.  Would you do that?  You put your finger on a guy's hiney?  I knew you were going to say that. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  You're right.  We finally got to the bottom of that, I guess.  We didn't believe that.  Literally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where did you guys hear that?  I don't know.  It's all over the place.  Who's asked to chit-chat?  I heard it on CNN Headlines.  When these little scams get together.  Access Hollywood.  Finger in the ass of Nicky Benz?  We'll be back and tell you about it.  How'd I get a six-pack?  Have you ever fingered a guy's ass?  I have, yeah.  Was it in a film or was it in private life?  It's a job interview. 
[02:47:30]  In private.  Guys on film are very sensitive about that.  Taking a prostate.  Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing.  Before she got into this.  What happened?  You were fooling around with a guy and were you going down on him and he asked for it?  Or how'd you...  Going down on a guy?  No, no.  I don't remember.  I know I've tried it out of curiosity.  Like was he just watching TV and you put your finger in it and went, huh?  Curiosity.  Is that what happens to you?  I'll take a...  Cracker Jack prize?  I can't take a whole lot.  I can take a little bit of a finger, but I can't take a whole one.  My girlfriend wants to fuck me with a strap on.  I can't take it because my ass is just too...  He says it makes him feel like he's got to make. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  I have to shit.  I can't do it.  He's got to make.  Well, I think we talked about this last time.  You have to enema.  Of course we did.  Oh, we did.  Boy, am I married.  You've got to keep the hiney clean.  I don't even touch my own ass.  No, it's just...  Jesus.  I'm not into the ass play.  But it feels good.  It does.  Well, no, I don't mind a girl's ass, you know, and that whole thing.  I'll fiddle around with that.  Okay.  If it's broken. 
[02:48:30]  You know, I'll tinker with it.  Yeah, what sexy terminology is this?  I'll use a little elbow grease and get in there.  What do you say when you get in there, pussy?  Let's give this a whirl.  A little elbow.  It sounds like a rabbit ears on that old TV.  I'll adjust the aerial.  Adjust the aerial.  I'm watching my shows, my programs, my stories.  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't mind that, like, a girl, I'll do anything.  I'll fucking shove my face in there.  I don't care.  But, like, as far as I'm concerned, I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  I don't think that, you know...  Well, you've had your butthole played with.  I know you have.  Some girls have tried, like, the little, you know...  Little tap-tap.  Not a surgeon, but a little Morse code.  You know?  They're fucking tapping out.  Fucking help.  And it felt good, right?  No, it made me, like, anxious that she was going to try the next step.  Okay.  And I'm like, how am I going to get out of this?  You ever had it licked?  No.  I had a massage girl one time on my stomach.  A massage girl?  I really did.  And she got the whole finger in, and she pulled my dick back between my legs and was tugging on it. 
[02:49:30]  A milking.  Like the tail of a Manx cat.  And she had a fucking...  A bob tail.  She had a full finger in, and, oh, I made embarrassing cummy noises.  We were groaning.  Like...  Yeah.  I was helpless.  I was literally wrapped around her...  Were you really?  I came really good, yeah.  And this was at Tim Hortons?  He sounded like Helen Keller when Ann Sullivan was pumping water into her hand.  Yes.  I was trying to sing Put Down the Ritz. 
[02:50:00]  It felt wonderful.  Did it?  Yeah.  See, I'm not into...  The old slippery finger.  And it isn't...  Don't be mistaken.  It's not like this fear of a gay thing.  Right.  I don't think that.  It just doesn't seem comfortable to me.  I'm a little inhibited by that whole area.  That could not be fine to Lee Press-On nail.  That's another thing.  What's floating around in there?  What did I eat?  It's a big lima bean skin.  And it's red.  No, it's supposed to feel really good for a guy.  I mean, I guess your G-spot's in there. 
[02:50:30]  That's my precept.  Right?  Do you like your honey toyed with?  You know, sometimes.  Minimal nut?  Yeah.  Depends who's doing it.  Yeah.  Oh, obviously.  Everything is in...  There's always a context.  Nothing's been in my ass since 2009.  Oh, Dwight.  She actually knows the years.  I do.  I really do.  Yeah, I remember that.  That's a bit memorable.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, thank you, Nick.  There's got to be a story.  Yeah, what happened?  No, I just...  The last time I had anything in my butt was for a long film, and that was in 2009. 
[02:51:00]  Nothing's been up there since...  I am?  Yeah.  You don't like it in your personal life?  No, no, no.  I do.  I just...  I don't know.  I've not been having any anal sex.  Is your boyfriend not into it?  In two years, that means the weeds are growing at this point.  No, I'm saving it.  I'll be doing anal this year.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't do that every year.  You've got to do it like...  Nah.  You've got to count on election years, you know?  You don't want your asshole so stretched out when you take a dump.  It's like somebody dumping a purse on the tip.  Shit just falls out of it loose. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, it could happen.  It's like a bodybuilder.  She's got to go on a cycle, you know?  You've got to cycle that thing.  You've cycled out a basketball.  I mean, I'm imagining it's really tight right now.  Yeah?  Nothing's been up there for a while.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Snug is a sexy word.  Snug?  It's a snug fit.  I like when it's a snug fit.  Not me.  I like it all stretched.  Yeah, a little room for...  Lucy-goosy?  I like it all catches mitt. 
[02:52:00]  Like a gallon of linseed going on.  I get to smell the same, too.  Shucky-ducky catches mitt.  What are you promoting?  Promoting?  Well, first of all,  Penthouse just relaunched their new online store,  penthousestore.com.  What can you buy there?  What kind of goods?  Everything from panties to lubricant  to the new Penthouse stripper pole.  Now, with this stripper pole,  we were supposed to get a little demonstration.  Right.  Now, who is this being marketed towards? 
[02:52:30]  Towards everybody.  Everybody.  I mean, preferably...  Well, there are some women I've seen  that I just don't want to...  You don't want them to swing?  Okay, well, I'm sure there's...  Not quite on the pole.  Not me.  I love them all.  Yeah, yeah.  Every one of them.  Yes, we love...  They're all angels.  They are.  For the fat ones.  My no-mates.  So, are you asking  if there's, like,  weight limit for it?  Yeah, yeah.  Is there a weight limit?  Can they swing on the pole  or do they just have to stand on  with all four like an elephant? 
[02:53:00]  If they're big and fat.  You know,  I'm sure there's a weight limit  like there is for everything.  There probably is.  Yeah, yeah.  Including the elevator, you know?  Yeah, even the elevator.  You don't want the pole  to turn into something  akin to a trebuchet.  You know?  Hey!  So you kind of launch it.  That's really good.  I'm using old siege weapon jokes.  What's a trebuchet?  It's French.  It's like a catapult  kind of a device.  That's the thing  that throws the pumpkins  if you do crazy morning zoo radio.  Pumpkin cannon?  Yes!  You don't want to store  energy in the pole.  It's like a big arm.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know. 
[02:53:30]  Right.  I was reaching there.  Well, unless if you have  ceilings like this,  this won't work.  Well, I was thinking  pop one of the tiles out  and then fasten  and attach it to the joists.  I know what my mom's good at.  Yeah, attach it to the joists.  Right, Jim.  You know.  Hey, Nikki,  is that you on the box?  That is me on the box.  Jesus H.  Christ.  Holy shit.  Nice box.  I could fucking install this thing.  Absolutely.  I know I can.  You could, yeah.  Let's do it.  Get us a fucking ladder.  Let's do it.  Get us a fucking ladder.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's do this.  I'll pop a tile out.  You're talking,  the ceiling tile  isn't the fucking ceiling 
[02:54:00]  of the actual thing.  It's a drop ceiling.  There's fucking concrete  and steel up there.  Get a ladder, Sam.  Get a concrete and steel.  The place was made for a pole.  Why are you yelling?  Exactly.  Why am I yelling?  Why is yelling?  Constantly yelling.  What's the matter, Sam?  You're very photogenic.  Well, thanks.  Thanks.  No, but, um...  Oh, that's you on the box.  It is me in the box.  Nice box.  It is a really nice box.  It is me on the box, boys.  Wow.  And it's portable.  It's portable.  And, you know, 
[02:54:30]  it's perfect,  especially for married guys.  Now, where does it normally go  where it wouldn't damage the car?  Oh, come on, Anthony.  In the kitchen, you dumbass.  In the kitchen?  In the kitchen.  Yeah, that's what you're doing.  Have your woman cook for you  and swing her on the pole.  Shucky-ducky.  Quack-quack.  You have to put it someplace  the company won't see it, though.  Yeah, that's true.  The boss is coming over.  You don't have to strip a pole  in the living room.  It's just something we do.  You have to put it somewhere  to strip.  In the bedroom.  Yeah, probably.  It would be sexy  like watching your girl  strip for you.  Yeah.  Well, you put a hole  in the ceiling.  Depends how long 
[02:55:00]  you've been with her.  Oh, that's true.  I don't know why that is.  No, just get her  some sexy lingerie  and she'll look sexy.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Maybe you can tell people  that it's from the firehouse.  Like if the company comes over,  you can just say that,  yes, we do rescue missions.  You're a volunteer fireman.  Yeah.  Boo.  Boo.  I just like the box,  for Christ's sake.  I know.  A nice box.  And it comes with  an instructional DVD  and pasties.  Oh, so the girl can really  make it all sexy.  Really?  Why would you wear pasties 
[02:55:30]  in the house?  Yeah.  Why not?  Does it come with an uncle  who fingered you  when you were eight?  Maybe your box does.  I'm not sure.  All due respect,  McGee.  That was just a joke.  All due respect.  Do you have one of those stories?  It's kind of a hat question,  but did something happen to you  when you were growing up?  No.  No?  No, I didn't have an uncle  who fingered me.  Sorry.  Nothing crazy like that.  But I think he did.  Aw, shit.  Aw, Nick.  Aw, Nick.  I wish I did.  She got you.  I had my picture on a box. 
[02:56:00]  How come ants aren't  as despicable as uncles are?  It would be nice  to get a little blowjob.  They are.  You don't hear about it.  It's the media.  No one complains.  I get it.  It's the liberal media.  They hide that shit.  You don't see a guy go,  and my aunt,  she diddled my balls.  It happens.  It does,  but I think men  are more molesters,  honestly.  Like an ant.  Believe me.  My cock was always out.  No ant ever took the bait.  No.  Never.  They ignored it.  Took the bait.  Yeah.  The bait.  He was trolling for ants. 
[02:56:30]  I think predatory  is just more male.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  I'm just curious about this.  Where does the top  goes against what?  The ceiling?  Yes.  And the bottom  goes against the floor,  obviously.  Right.  But what's to keep  the top from going  to the ceiling?  Is it like a lolly column  or something?  It's like a fucking  lolly column  that's a little thinner.  I think it's like  a shower rod.  That's right.  A shower rod.  That's right.  Okay.  I'm guessing.  Let's try to get this done.  But it's tested safe, 
[02:57:00]  right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yes.  I saw a clip of a bride,  some Russian bride.  Oh, I saw that.  I saw that.  Oh, yeah.  It was probably not...  No, I bet it was  a competitor's pole,  by the way.  It was.  It was made in Poland.  It was a pole pole.  It's safe, I can tell.  It's very sturdy,  and whoever you saw,  they probably didn't  install it properly.  You can't put it  between the door.  They don't know how to do it.  Well, she doesn't have  any room to do anything there.  Exactly.  She can't do it  anywhere else.  Pop the ceiling tile.  Watch what happens.  Yeah?  You tell me what's up there. 
[02:57:30]  Travis said  that the ceiling tile  doesn't move  like regular ceiling tiles  because there's wires  and you can only move it  two or three inches.  Oh, what a load of shite this is.  Danny, watch this.  Watch this.  It's funny if the whole...  Pop it up.  Oh, shit.  And then,  because you got him in,  it'll come out.  All right, pop another one.  Why don't we ask dumb Mars?  Pop it up and slide it over.  He's probably not listening.  Yeah, but that's okay.  You just pop it up  and slide it over.  Why don't we just get Mars?  This is typical of me.  I'm here.  We got a hut stripper,  and a penthouse.  And we're doing construction.  There you go.  Excuse me, penthouse.  They don't like the stripper thing anymore. 
[02:58:00]  You're not a stripper.  I just leaned over  to peek at her underpants.  It's not going?  I'm such a creep.  That thing would annoy me.  What kind of underpants?  They're pink.  I couldn't see.  They're very sexy.  Oh, me?  Hanes.  No.  Jimmy's looking at your underpants.  I just caught myself.  No, I leaned over  and I actually just peeked  at your underpants.  Could you take the leather pants  off for Nick?  For Nick, of course.  I felt very creepy  doing that.  Holy mackerel.  Except for the married guy.  I've got a hot pink thong.  And a hot pink bra.  And a matching bra.  You have a lovely bottom,  if I may.  Oh.  Gracias. 
[02:58:30]  Venture a compliment.  Yeah.  That should get the job done.  That was great for you.  That was a good compliment.  Thank you very much.  I'm very smooth.  You're real good at that.  You're very chesty.  I am very chesty.  Thank you very much.  Lovely.  Two for two.  Thank you.  I agree with all this.  How did they get those tiles in?  I don't know.  It's annoying me.  Travis was right.  What?  No, Travis is an idiot.  That's a good point, too.  He's not a...  He's a quitter.  He just quit on that fucking pole.  Yeah.  I wanted to see her  swing around on that pole.  I really did, too.  I really did, too. 
[02:59:00]  Are you concerned?  Mars opens the door.  Look, he almost died doing that.  What?  It would have been worth it.  I wouldn't have minded.  Mars, what's going on  with the ceiling?  The dropped ceiling.  Why can't we get a pole up there?  So you can push the pole up there.  But we can't.  Well, I'm telling you.  Ah, fuck it.  All right.  Well, we can do Roland, though, right?  We can do Roland, yes.  I will do Roland.  You used Roland as a pole.  You beat him up last time.  You gave him a good spanking.  I did.  I did.  I think I overdid it, though.  No, you won't have to.  It was hurting a little bit.  Really?  Yeah.  He loved it.  Yeah.  It was terrific. 
[02:59:30]  What happened?  Is there a...  What's going on over there?  I haven't seen guys so determined.  I know.  No, I know.  There really is a great determination here.  I really want to swing around the pole.  I do.  We'd like to see you do it.  I bet.  We would.  Hi, Roland.  Can't a bunch of guys just hold the pole if they're on chairs?  Kenny can do it.  It's like the Italian one.  Kenny's strong.  What's that?  Use Kenny as the pole.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  I don't know how they installed it.  Amazing.  This is a bummer. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Thanks.  We tried.  Ooh.  It's a shame.  Of course.  How about the hallway?  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  Why would anything work?  Jesus Christ.  Can I at least put the pasties on myself?  Okay.  Oh, well, you better do that.  Let's think about that.  I don't know.  Where's this show going anyway?  New Orleans one time, this girl was trying to get me to go into the special room.  I'd already given her like 150 bucks.  Is that where retards go?  Yes.  It's where they dance around your tongue and your fucking, your non-earned medals. 
[03:00:30]  But no, I was, I was sitting there and she's grinding on my dick.  She said, do you want to go into the other room?  And I felt like, I felt like I had just crushed that final, like, I'm like, I could come in  my pants.  And she fucking kept grinding.  I'm like, yeah, I'll go.  I just kept talking to make her do it.  I'm like, just keep doing that for a second.  And I fucking shot off in my pants.  And I was doing a gig with Pete Correale and Louis Ramey.  And I fucking walk out.  I was wearing silk boxers.  Oh, shit.  Not very absorbent.  I opened my pants and I just showed them the fucking giant stain. 
[03:01:00]  And then I went back to the hotel while they went out and drank.  Because my night was dunsky.  Cute story.  It sure is.  It's a cute story, isn't it?  Yeah, I was fucking, I had to fucking, my, it was, my silk boxers were drying to my, they  were drying to my dick on the way back.  I had to peel my fucking helmet off the silk boxers.  They went out and had a night of fun friendship.  What, how is she manipulating you where you came?  Was it a knee job or her hand?  No, no, no, her ass cheek.  The ass cheek, like I, I, I, I put my cock. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, so you laid your cock on your thigh, kind of.  I positioned it right.  No, pointing up towards me.  Oh, okay.  It was pointed down, it would have hurt.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was pointed up towards me.  And she just had her ass cheeks on it.  And she was just like rocking back and forth, rocking back and forth.  Like the one steady movement.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  And I fucking, I just.  Oh, wow.  I was an idiot.  What's that?  I pushed a girl off me when I thought I was going to blow up my butt.  Oh, really?  What?  Pushy your niece?  Her little, her little patent leather shoe was stepping on Nick's wiener.  Well, it was Easter, huh? 
[03:02:00]  You were supposed to, you were supposed to change her ribbon.  I didn't think I was right on a confirmation day.  All right, we, we should have her dance around.  Yes.  Let's, let's get this done.  Really?  I mean, she wants to dance around something at this point.  Everybody's standing around.  Was it homo night?  Yeah, somebody take charge.  Yeah.  She's really lovely.  She's going to give Roland a lap dance.  We're all, we're all a little jealous.  What song do you want?  Rebecca Black, Friday?  How about when the Tigers broke free?  Huh?  Oh, that Pink Floyd song? 
[03:02:30]  I had something for, for Roland.  Dude, I can't believe how popular she got, that girl.  Rebecca Black?  She's so annoying.  Isn't that crazy?  It is crazy.  Rebecca Black, Friday.  All right, how are we doing this?  Well, how are we doing this?  Well, where's Roland going to sit?  Oh, look, she's fucking already gyrating.  Yeah.  Roland's lucky.  Roland's a lucky stiff.  Roland is sitting down on the, uh, on the couch.  Are you allowed to tweet, are you allowed to tweet nipple pics?  I don't even know anymore.  Why not?  Well, that's why I haven't sent anything out of you.  I would err on the side of safety.  Oh, yeah.  Because somebody might be offended. 
[03:03:00]  We're going to have to do a broad picture after the show, though.  Look at those.  You should have, uh...  Fuck that, you could pixelate them.  Just Twitter people.  Pixelate them to annoy people.  I don't have time for that shit.  For the pasties, you should have put, like, the fucking face of the guy who does the great  adventure commercials.  The old man.  Just told me to wreck that sexy vibe.  Eh, eh, eh.  That guy?  Oh, I hate him.  Or Dudley Moore's foot.  That would have been a funny face.  That love foot.  Or his hat.  The old guy with his brain in it.  We got Roland on the couch.  Roland. 
[03:03:30]  The song has begun.  Okay.  Fucking Lincoln's hat was in better shape.  Our American cousin.  I wonder if Roland's one of those guys that comes in, like, two minutes.  Oh, shit.  Wow, wait.  No, he's not.  She's doing it.  See, that would do it.  Like, the way she's grinding with her ass.  No, no, no.  If you're coming after I'm doing this, then you're lame.  Then you're lame.  Then you're lame.  Well, I am lame.  But for the guy...  God, that's, like, the best thing. 
[03:04:00]  I'm actually not lame.  No one's going to care about...  Yeah, no one's going to care about satisfying you.  And nothing personal, but you're dancing.  So it's like, if you could sit there and I would be able to come, that'd be fantastic.  I'm not lame.  Last time I checked, you weren't doing charity work.  It's cost me 20 bucks a song.  Exactly.  I'm not lame.  I just saved 80 bucks.  Who's lame?  I'm Lame.  That's French.  I'm L apostrophe A-M-E.  That was a bomb A.  I know. 
[03:04:30]  I want to make...  Oh, look at that fucking thong sticking out of the back like that.  She has a knee on his...  I meant Roland.  Roland, how does that feel, Roland?  Um, God bless you.  Did your dick sneeze?  She reminds me of Trump's daughter.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  It was very beautiful.  Oh, yeah, yeah, a little bit.  I see that.  Roland just wiped his nose on her breasts.  I don't know how sexy that really was.  What's her name?  Ivanka.  She's fucking hot.  I like that one.  Oh, that's pretty good. 
[03:05:00]  You look really stiff.  What happened?  Yeah.  You should just rub your hiney on his penis.  That would get me going.  Yeah, look at that.  She's got her tits in his face.  I have on sweats, too.  This would be a good lap dance outfit.  I'll just do that.  Oh, really?  It's nice and loose.  I'm picking my bag off my legs.  She's kind of...  He's getting a chubby.  He's like a mick.  Well, that happened years ago.  It's more like, he's getting a fat.  Roland's getting a chubby.  Yeah.  He's speaking Italian.  Well, that answers one question we've been wondering about for many years.  It's got to look like a Make-A-Wish commercial. 
[03:05:30]  He's shy, you guys, with everyone staring at him.  No, we're like...  I'll go over there.  Is there a curtain that closes?  Yeah, the curtain has to close.  Yeah, notice it's getting warm in here.  Look out.  Hands.  Oh, wow.  She just put his hands on her hips.  Nice.  And now he's holding on for dear life.  It'd be funny if he started turning to De Niro from Kate's ear.  Is he all clammy?  His hands are clammy.  Roland's hands are clammy on her hips, on her bare hips.  That's funny.  Are you offering me something, huh? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  It's funny.  What's the matter, Roland?  You didn't like touching her?  No, I don't know.  His hands are sweating like he's a fucking eel handler.  He's enjoying it, but he's shy because everyone's staring at him.  Does that even exist?  Those would be some clammy hands.  He called the eel handler for this job.  Oh, he's touching titty.  Oh, Roland's touching titty.  Nice.  She just put his hands on her breasts.  Now, do they feel a little sweaty?  A little bit.  Well, now that I wipe them off on my hips, they get better. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  It feels like there's two codfish on her breasts.  Only not as warm.  Oh, just.  Ugh.  Oh.  Jesus.  Breaking out in sweat.  Are you okay?  I'm just tinkering with my shaft.  You should just bread and fry your hands.  Nice.  That's an awful thing.  They really are.  He's soup hands.  I want to talk to you.  His hands are like lentil soup.  No, I can keep going, but I don't want him to bust a nut. 
[03:07:00]  Why not?  You should be a good egg.  I'd love to go home with cum in my pants.  Yeah, that would be good.  Guess what happened at work today?  I don't think Roland will cum.  He's all business back there.  Yeah.  He really is.  I have to pee or I.  Yeah?  Not that she wants to.  I'm just saying.  Oh, what?  Hold it?  Oh, if you wanted to sit there and get a dance.  What about, well, Sam.  What about Nick DiPaolo?  That'd get your girl back.  For what she's doing in Rio.  Only if this isn't televised and you don't use my name. 
[03:07:30]  Can I be Bob for the second of the day?  Good point, sir.  Bob Kelly, you want to?  You're Bob Kelly for the rest of the second.  I'm guessing this is going to be on the Anthony, right?  I'm going to assume it always ends up there somehow.  It's the nudity.  Yeah.  You've got to find a place.  Wow, that was good.  Wait, I could tweet a bra picture, can't I?  How are you feeling, Roland?  Good?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, okay.  Do you got a little stain in your pants? 
[03:08:00]  Did you leak a little clear fluid?  It would shit itself.  It would shit itself.  Was your cock head just like spitting a little tobacco?  Tobacco.  I'm a leaker.  There we go.  I really am.  Holy fuck.  That we could tweet.  That's funny, man.  I always leave a lot of evidence in my underpants when I've been bad.  Do you?  I do.  I spot.  Yeah.  My dick's like a bingo daughter.  With invisible ink in it.  Nikki, what's your Twitter?  Uh, at Nikki Benz. 
[03:08:30]  At?  N-I-K-K-I-B-N-Z.  Some sites on, uh, things from my daughter's college, you know, their website.  Is it?  Is it?  Yeah, it sounds it.  Yeah.  It is German.  Of course it is.  You look very nice.  Yeah, you look very Nordic.  Awesome German girl.  Super race.  That's nice, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, super race, definitely.  Yes, because that really is my real last name, so you know.  Oh, I got it.  Oh.  What nationality are you for?  Ukrainian.  Oh.  Benzinski? 
[03:09:00]  Benzinski?  Is that something good?  Is it a long, one of those long names?  No, it's not.  I mean, I'd tell you, but.  Flynn.  Doesn't matter.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  You're Ukrainian or what else?  100% Ukrainian?  Yeah, Canadian, Ukrainian.  Okay.  Do you speak French?  No.  Do you?  No.  Do you speak Greek?  I took two, yeah.  Not since 09.  Oh, call back.  Call back.  I took two years of French in high school, but I don't remember any of it.  Yeah, same here.  I can count to 10.  That's more than me. 
[03:09:30]  In English.  I meant in English.  Yeah.  I don't do it in French.  I can count to eight and a half.  Yes.  I can count to about four right now.  I got fluffed up a little bit.  Did you get a little puffy?  And I take Dramamine when I fly, so my dick is of no value.  What do you put it up your dick hole?  What does Dramamine do to your fucking cock?  It just relaxes you so much.  Yeah, my dick gets airsick.  Up your dick.  Comes when a stewardess walks by.  Yeah, what are you going to fucking do?  I need a barf bag for my cock.  No, no, no.  But I take Dramamine. 
[03:10:00]  It relaxes me.  It makes me very tired.  I flew last night, so I'm fucking...  A little shot.  Wiped out, yeah.  Usually my dick is terrible.  What are you doing tonight?  Just fucking probably sleeping.  Not you, Jimmy.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Yeah, what are you doing?  But can you still jerk off and like...  There's not...  Literally, if my hands are cut off, I'd find a way to tape it to my stump.  So the answer is yes.  That would be uncomfortable.  I don't know.  You said your dick doesn't work, so I just wanted to...  It doesn't matter.  I'll fuck it.  I'll just abuse it soft. 
[03:10:30]  I just kick it like a fucking dog that won't fetch.  Can I jerk off?  Yes.  At the casket of a relative.  There's no place I can't jerk off.  Shit, man.  Yes, I can.  Yeah, Ann was asking what you were doing later.  Later, I am going to relax.  Oh, you don't have any plans for like, you know, going out?  Going out this weekend.  Oh, it's this weekend.  Yeah. 
[03:11:00]  In Pennsylvania.  Oh, no.  This weekend, I'm in New York.  I'm here until Sunday.  Where do you live?  L.A.  L.A.?  Oh, you're an L.A. girl.  I was just in La La Land.  Yeah.  This is bonding.  I came back yesterday on the red eye.  With Diana Ross.  She was going out.  Do you know Diana Ross?  Uh-huh.  Do you like her?  Not really.  I'm kidding.  Am I supposed to say yes?  I don't know.  No.  No, you're not.  You're not a gay man.  I'm not a gay man.  No, actually, I... 
[03:11:30]  Oh, they love her.  Speaking of comedy,  I was at the Improv last week  and I did three jokes.  Oh, really?  Believe it or not,  people actually laughed.  I loved it.  Really?  Can we hear one?  Yeah, let's hear some of this.  Hold on.  This is worth taping.  All right.  Why did the chicken cross the road?  To fuck me.  I shug it, I shug it, I shug it, I quack, quack.  That's pretty good.  What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
[03:12:00]  If I would have been there,  they both would have come at the same time.  I like that, I like that.  Funny, because she's beautiful.  And complete the hat trick here, please.  Very good.  And the third one was,  and this is true,  because I really recently just became a vegetarian,  so I don't eat out as much anymore.  Unless if I go to work,  I was working with this girl the other day  and she had so much roast beef between her legs,  she could have opened an Arby's.  Oh, damn.  I kind of like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little dirty. 
[03:12:30]  It implies that the girl had a beefy you-know-what  with dashes in between each word.  That's your specialty, isn't it, Jimmy?  There's different levels of beef, too.  Some are very beefy, some are not so much.  How is yours?  It's not that really...  Is yours like a quarter pounder,  or is it just a regular cheeseburger?  I like it like a Little Nick Clam,  just completely...  You have to shuck that fucking thing open.  I want it to look like a fucking roadside bomb  just went off in it.  I want shrapnel in her underpants.  It's an IED fucking... 
[03:13:00]  I do.  IED pussy.  Yeah.  I want a fucking vagina.  I want a veteran laying next to her with a leg missing.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, I like big.  I like big lips.  Do you?  Fuck yeah.  Because a friend of mine in high school,  I'm not friends with her anymore,  her lips are so big she could tie a knot  out of her pussy lips.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  You like that, Jim?  Yeah, I would love to listen to Tony Orlando  and tie a yellow ribbon.  No.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  We heard it.  Okay.  Oof.  I should boot three times at the ceiling.  Her lips are so big,  she signs autographs as Jimmy Walker.  What?  Who, um...  A little timing.  Excuse me.  Who in the business has really big clit  or big pussy lips?  Ella Fitzgerald.  Hers are huge.  It's like somebody put an M80 in a pot roast.  I'm sure it conjures up an image.  I heard, um... 
[03:14:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Ethel Merman,  I heard,  had one pussy lip bigger than the other  due to somebody in a wooden shoe  stepping on it.  What the fuck?  I don't even know how to respond  to something like that.  I just made it up.  It's a screenplay I'm working on.  It's called Long Pussy.  Featuring the music of Ethel Merman.  It's...  Sorry.  It's no pussy like that.  Sorry.  But yeah,  so who would you say  in the business 
[03:14:30]  has really big lips?  Big lips?  Yeah.  I don't even know.  I mean,  big is not necessarily bad.  Like,  I like them,  I like the variety.  I love,  you know,  the different pussy.  Just a little puff to it.  How about,  anybody have a hair lip down there?  Yeah.  Somebody from Calcutta,  one of those Keech's  seen a big cleft palate pussy.  Like a Stacy Keech vagina.  Joaquin.  I like that.  They have a Joaquin vagina hair.  No,  some girls definitely  have like really big clits.  It looks like a little penis. 
[03:15:00]  Who has a big clit?  A few girls.  I don't really want to name names.  What?  I know I have a small clit.  If they're porn girls,  that's not a secret  that if they're porn girls.  Yeah,  well,  I didn't know.  Well,  they hide it with makeup.  Like,  Vanessa Del Rio  had a big clit.  That was her thing.  She was known for that  many years ago.  I like lips like Silly Putty  where you can pick up  the comics with it.  Look,  Dondi.  And then you can stretch it.  Am I showing my age?  Exactly. 
[03:15:30]  I like a fucking  I can play with a slinky.  Yeah.  What do you like to  fucking read along  with fucking Mayor LaGuardia  too?  Sorry,  the depression.  I don't think  Dondi's been in the paper  in a quarter century.  That made her put her shirt  back on.  I don't need my shirt  back on.  Why are you doing that?  God,  if that doesn't mean  we're done.  Do you understand?  If that doesn't mean  we're done.  Nikki wouldn't name  a porn girl  who had a big clit  like it's a secret.  I know.  I didn't want to take it out.  Porn girl.  Nikki,  let's do one more shot  with the shirt.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  Let me make it a little sexy.  Hey,  Nick,  give the plug.  Hold on,  where's Nick going to be?  Nick and then Nikki.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  I'm going to be  at Governor's this weekend  and next weekend  Uncle Vinny's in Staten Island  and then the Playboy Club  in Vegas  for the 7th  to the 9th of April.  Oh,  we don't like that.  And I'm on Twitter too.  Yeah,  what's your...  I don't know.  Twitter.com  slash Nick DiPaolo,  I'm guessing.  Just look.  I got an Asian kid  that does that show.  And I'll be at the Irvine  Improv next Thursday, 
[03:16:30]  Friday,  Saturday.  It's my first time in Irvine.  I've been there many times.  Is it a good gig?  But I lived out there  at the time  and it's when people knew me.  Yeah,  I'm not...  We'll see how it goes.  I'm sure you'll do great.  And Nikki Benz.  You guys can find me  on penthouse.com  and I've got some  3D pornos on there too.  3D pornos.  3D pornos.  How do we watch those?  Do we need glasses?  You do need glasses.  And where do you get  the glasses?  In penthouse?  Kind of look like  they've got it.  PenthouseStore.com 
[03:17:00]  I saw a nude woman  and I got my  big cumsies in my pants.  Now I need replacements.  Does it look 3D?  It looks incredible.  What do you do?  Like your tits are like  whoa, they're right there.  Each scene looks like  pretty much  but it's like an experience.  There's so much depth  to each scene.  It looks really cool.  And you won't get  cum in your eyes.  Yeah, that's...  You look like that kid  that blew John Voight  in Midnight Cowboy  in the theater.  Are you going to beat me up? 
[03:17:30]  Are you going to beat me up?  I can't go home  without my money.  My mother will kill me.  That was great.  What a scene.  That was fucking great.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Grandma's going to buy you  a Mockingbird.  How great was that, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know, he's touching the girl  and I'm singing  Midnight Cowboy fucking songs.  Inappropriately.  Inappropriately.  He's picking lint off you.  He's petting her hair  like fucking Lenny  of Mice and Men.  See how this ends.  Yeah.  Why don't you just take her  in the barn  and let her show you  her fucking rabbit.  Choke her. 
[03:18:00]  How do you touch  a porn star inappropriately?  I'm trying to figure that out.  That's true.  With a cinder block.  That's pretty inappropriate.  Yeah, how do you do that?  I would have liked  to see you in pole dance.  I know, I can't believe you.  I know.  I guess that's it then.  Fucking play.  Really?  Nicky Benz, thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Nicky Paul, thank you so much.  Nick, always a pleasure.  Good to see you guys again.  Finding somebody in here  that I can relate to.  Well, politically.  Most people relate to me.  Believe me.  Most of the country.  You and Jimmy a little bit. 
[03:18:30]  Trust me.  Jimmy could be a little  lib fag sometimes, though.  There's certain things, yes.  There's certain things  the Republicans sicken me, yes.  Yeah, of course.  Because they're as phony as a liberal.  They're not conservative enough.  Top of the party line.  All right, well,  believe me,  they'd throw us out of the  fucking gig in a second  if they could.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  No, you're right.  Could use the sleep.  They're all off.  I know.  No kidding.  All right, Nicky.  It's all about Nicky.  Look at her eye lashes.  They're long and nice.  They're very long.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you, guys.  Coming up on an all-new  Owen Day Behind the Laughter,

And his sphincter.  And then she stopped.  I ran into the bathroom  because I had farts.  And we all know  farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like...  Hysterical laughter  and soiled bed sheets.  I kept saying,  how much is in?  And she's like,  that much?  When we go behind the laughter  with comedian Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony Show.
