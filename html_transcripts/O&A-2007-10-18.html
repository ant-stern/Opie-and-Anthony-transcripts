<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the “Phone Call Thursday” $1000 contest, met with the hosts’ usual frustration at callers solely focused on winning, labeled as “prize pigs” and “dopes.”  A discussion ensued about Opie’s conversation with a veteran angered by the Empire State Building’s green lighting for Ramadan, sparking debate about patriotism, religious holidays, and the evolving sensitivities in war reporting.  A caller shared their positive experience seeing Chaz Palminteri’s *A Bronx Tale*, leading to a humorous tale of Jimmy’s reckless attempt to retrieve his girlfriend’s wallet from a speeding cab.  The show played a song about a woman's love for fatty foods, followed by a funny internet clip featuring identical twins.  The hosts then vented about their abrupt removal from Detroit radio, criticizing the lack of communication and what they perceived as cowardice from management, further lamenting the lack of "men" in the radio industry.

The show continued with more complaints about their unfair treatment by corporate overlords, comparing their situation to a woman leaving without explanation, following the Pittsburgh and Detroit cancellations.  A caller, Mike from Philly, voiced concern about the show potentially leaving Philadelphia, criticizing the competing show, Preston and Steve, as “crap.” Opie and Anthony insisted they wanted to stay in Philly but emphasized the decision rested with YSP.  This transitioned into a humorous segment analyzing surprising Google search trends, revealing top searches for “Tom Cruise,” “Hangover,” “Britney Spears,” “sex,” “gay,” and “Viagra,” across various countries and cities.  The segment included humorous asides, notably Opie’s misinterpretation of a perceived kiss between Anthony and a guest.  Germany topping the list for “Hitler” searches prompted a discussion on the sensitivities surrounding the topic and the complex legacy of Nazi Germany’s technological advancements, with comparisons to the Roman Empire.  The discussion continued with the top locations searching for “lesbian” and “Viagra,” punctuated with jokes.

A “prize pig” caller, Ty, attempted to win the $1000, followed by Jody winning the prize.  A clip of President Bush misusing the word “Google” was played, followed by a discussion of Google Street View’s intrusive nature, media censorship, and public access to unedited content online.  The show then addressed the increasing number of reported noose incidents and whether they should be considered hate crimes, leading to a discussion about disproportionate attention given to certain issues in the Black community, including commentary on absent fathers, referencing Bill Cosby and O.J. Simpson.  A caller expressed appreciation for their “Demented World” CD, and the hosts announced plans to make it available for free download.  The segment ended with a prank call to a nanny’s mother, falsely claiming her daughter was working in the porn industry.

The next segment focused on Streetviewhotties.com and the Larry Craig bathroom incident fallout. The hosts mocked an old aircheck of E-Rock, a former colleague.  A $1000 sound effect contest was promoted.  The hosts reacted humorously to Streetviewhotties.com, dissecting E-Rock’s radio promo, and heavily criticized Larry Craig’s explanations.  They briefly discussed the Google Lunar X Prize and a caller’s difficulty identifying something funny on the show.  Chaz Palminteri and Jerry Springer were mentioned as upcoming guests.

The show then discussed the Google moon race contest, jokingly proposing their own contests involving a “WOW” logo on the moon, the Presidential helicopter, or even the President’s back.  They complained about Ron and Fez spoiling *Lost* episodes, discussing sponsorship money and ONA Radio distribution.  A graphic anecdote about XM employee Don Wicklund and his alleged rat-catching habits, including a claim of having eight rats up his ass, was recounted.  An old internet story about a gerbil used as a projectile in a homosexual encounter was revisited alongside a news report that initially took the story seriously.

Jim Norton joined for "Tech Talk," discussing the show's intro, his self-perceived unattractiveness, his relationship, and technical incompetence.  Discussions about large cash prizes from sponsors like Don Wicklund or Will Chapman followed, along with mentions of C.C., Eric Logan, and Christopher Knight.  A contest involving eating WOW stickers and the disposal of unused merchandise was suggested, referencing *About Schmidt*.  Jim Norton’s segment returned with more jokes about his appearance and technical skills.  The Don Wicklund story was further elaborated with inappropriate details.  The hosts then discussed their involvement in Grand Theft Auto, detailing interactions with Laszlo, focusing on their roles as "yelling guys." Audio clips of Opie's voice acting were played.  Technical issues with CD players led to further discussions about acting and portraying emotions. Jim Norton discussed a romantic comedy script, using off-color humor. A call to Don Wicklund was attempted but failed due to technical issues.  A commercial break for Ammunition and Derek the Dodo (gun safety) followed.  The second half further detailed interactions with Laszlo, emphasizing the secrecy and repetitive nature of their contributions to Grand Theft Auto.  The conversation returned to Jim Norton and his "Tech Talk," including humorous anecdotes.  The show mentioned upcoming shows, Saturday night programming, and a call from Ralphie May, followed by a discussion of his experience on Preston & Steve’s show, including butt plug karaoke. The conversation concluded with a discussion of Ralphie May's success and a re-reading of the gerbil story.

The show started with a bizarre news story about a man retrieving a gerbil from his intestine with a lit match, leading to a discussion of the Ellen DeGeneres dog custody dispute, using highly offensive language. Ralphie May called in, engaging in a lengthy, vulgar conversation about his newborn daughter, April June May, joking about strippers and the challenges of naming a child.  The conversation shifted to a tragic plane crash involving Ralphie's relatives, with condolences from the hosts.  Studio guests Than and Sam discussed their appearance on Ripe TV, leading to a discussion about the show’s content.  The final segment proposed an “Afro Wars” competition between the Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez shows, morphing into a discussion about hairy body parts and a potential “hairy ball contest.”  Offensive jokes were made throughout, concluding with the scheduling of Afro Wars and discussions of participants and challenges.


The final segment heavily featured Ron Fez's new mohawk, resulting from a lost bet.  The hosts speculated on the hairstyle's appearance.  The conversation touched upon the upcoming Pat Cooper roast, necessitating the show’s early end.  Bronx Johnny, a podcast host, was a guest, promoting his show.  A lengthy Miles Davis song played in the background.  Listener-submitted “line of the day” entries were read and discussed.  There was brief discussion of listener feedback and complaints, mentions of the upcoming “Afro Wars” segment and a “hairy ball contest.”  The segment ended abruptly due to time constraints imposed by the Pat Cooper roast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  We get it.  They're shocking.  If you want to put it, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  Boom!  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Ah.  On this fine phone call Thursday.  Oh, it's phone call Thursday.  Cool.  Phone call Thursday and a thousand dollar contest.  Oh boy.  I'm trying to use reverse psychology.  Wow.  Phone call Thursday.  I'm so psyched.  It ain't gonna work.  We got ten phones already lit on hold because it's phone call Thursday.  Giving away a thousand dollars today.  So, basically, we can't rely on the listeners.  We're actually gonna have to do all the, uh, the listeners hate when I say this. 
[00:02:00]  All the heavy lifting today.  Heavy lifting.  Your pals are gonna have to talk more and, and, uh, and, and we're gonna have to be a  little more creative than usual.  We can't rely on these dopes today.  Because the phones are just gonna be, hi, happy phone call Thursday.  And then it's gonna be, did I win a thousand dollars?  Hi, did I win a thousand dollars?  Hi, it's phone call Thursday.  Yeah.  And I'm sure a couple of baba boys.  Just for the hell of it.  Why is, uh, why is the, um, desktop over there on E-Rock's computer, the green Empire 
[00:02:30]  State Building, the green lit up Empire State Building.  I got, I got into a little conversation with a veteran, an old veteran yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The guy was, I was getting out of my, my, uh, truck and, and he was like, watch your  door for his car.  I'm like, oh, you know, I, I always, I said, no.  I always watch my door because I have cars that I really get upset when people open the 
[00:03:00]  door and leave a ding in it.  He goes, well, this is a loner.  He goes, I, I have smashed up my other one.  And he's like old, he's got a cane.  He's got the veterans of foreign war hat on and everything.  And, um, and he said, my, my car, it hit a dumpster.  And all I'm thinking is it's never the dumpster's fault when you hit a dumpster.  He goes, I was kind of, and it wasn't even backing in or anything.  He goes, I came around a corner and hit a dumpster. 
[00:03:30]  It's never just in the road.  And, uh, so he started talking about, um, how, uh, uh, the Empire State Building was  lit up green.  And I said, well, that's, uh, that was for, uh, Ramadan, uh, a Muslim, uh, holiday.  They actually lit the Empire State Building up green.  And then he goes, are you one of them?  I swear to you.  I go, I go, no, no.  I go, I think it's a, I said, I think it's a goddamn disgrace. 
[00:04:00]  I go, it should be lit up red, white, and blue every night.  And he's like, God bless you.  He goes, you're, you're one of the good ones.  This country's going to crap.  And then he's telling me how the country's going to crap.  If you only knew.  If you only knew.  Anthony's one of the good ones.  He fought my kind.  And that's not the first time people have been confused by your luck, so.  Well, perhaps, I think it was more my knowledge of Ramadan and why the Empire State Building  had been lit up green, uh, uh, for a, a holiday that, that is for people, uh, who were behind 
[00:04:30]  the, the taking down of two of our buildings.  What are you doing?  Putting a target on it?  That's like, just fly up another plane into the green.  I was a little, uh, taken aback by that.  I don't know who owns the Empire State Building these days, but, um, it, it is a little, a little  disgraceful and a little, to light it up for Ramadan.  Do they light it up, uh, for every religious holiday?  Do they do that? 
[00:05:00]  I, I don't know, man.  I mean, you drive in from Long Island and all of a sudden, like, the top of, uh, the Empire  State Building's pink.  Like, what does that mean?  Well, that's for the gay, uh, pride.  Gay pride, they light it up pink.  Really?  Which is kind of funny that gays decided to take pink as their, uh, their color, because  it's kind of a stereotype of the whole gay thing.  But the rainbow.  Wait, wait, can I tell you something?  I don't know, if you're gay, what a great symbol.  Yeah.  That Empire State Building, boy.  Oh, wow.  You what?  With a pink top?  Oof.  With a, with a thin top? 
[00:05:30]  I mean, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, hoo.  No.  You certainly don't want the Capitol Building as your, uh, as your symbol.  You don't want that lit up.  No.  They probably tell different people it's for different things.  Like, they tell the Muslims it's green for Ramadan.  They tell the Jews it's green for money.  Oh, true.  Yeah.  And they can both love it.  It's for you.  And it tells the Irish, uh, another day to drink.  Yes.  Yes.  Today's a drinking day.  Toss a few back.  Just in case you were wondering, yes, you could drink today, too. 
[00:06:00]  To all the Irish.  Thank God you could still make fun of the Irish without them marching and screaming and yelling  and having meetings with Tom Chiasano and getting jocks fired.  At least you could still make fun of the Irish.  God bless the Irish.  Uh, question.  And I only have a drop in me, by the way.  Ooh.  Just a drop.  Question.  What would he have said if I replied, yes, I am a Muslim?  He said, I thought you were one of them.  And then I forgot to say, he said, because I was gonna, I was gonna, uh, something like  hit you.  He didn't say hit me, but he was gonna, like, wrap me with his cane. 
[00:06:30]  If, if I had said that I was one of them.  See, there's some old codgers around there that just, they are, they have no, um, uh,  tolerance.  I, I had a great idea until you said he was a vet, and then I had to, like, zip it, zip  it, zip it.  Well, that's, that's exactly what I do.  I see the veterans.  I, I give vets a lot of benefit of the doubt.  I don't mess with the vets.  I used to hang out at, uh, the, uh, the VA hall, whatever it's called, the VF, uh, W.  VFW, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  With my pops, uh, when he was still alive.  And, man, wow, you want to hear racism.  Oh, yeah, really?  Wow.  Wow.  It was a different time.  I think that's the last place you're allowed to say hit those things.  The last bastion.  And I bring it up every once in a while.  I would go, uh, you know, uh, run into my dad.  He would be at the VFW with his, with his buddies, and I'd have a beer before going out  or whatever.  And you had the black guy, you had the Polish guy, you had the Italian guy, you had the Irish  guy.  And they're all just beating the crap out of each other. 
[00:07:30]  Out of the black guy.  Oh.  No.  Out of each other, right.  Honestly, the black guy in this situation can hold his own.  Of course.  But let me tell you something.  They weren't shy about using the N-word in a joking fashion.  No.  And that just made the black guy try harder to beat up the Irish and the Polish.  And it was just amazing watching these guys go around the room and just beat the crap  out of each other with the jokes.  I'll tell you, if you want, uh, if you're, if you're an old codger there and you want  me to be, uh, sympathetic to your horrid driving habits on the road, just have one of the license 
[00:08:00]  plate frames that say, you know, veteran, veteran of foreign war or a POW or something  like that.  I back right off.  The guy's been through enough crap.  He doesn't need my yelling insanity.  You know, he was riding.  Dealing with him.  God, there's a line I want to use.  I can't.  You can get fired for it, which is ridiculous.  It has nothing to do with the FCC, but I guess you got to be careful if you want to  keep your stupid job on the radio.  But what a brilliant line I have in my effing head.  Maybe it'll be, um, subconscious line of the day. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  It could be never said line of the day.  Hey, how about you remember it?  And during commercials, we all have a good laugh.  Well, how about this?  Uh, yeah, you could use your imagination out there.  You know, now he's driving slow on the Long Island Expressway.  But back in the day, he was in a tank running over you-know-what.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Krauts.  Or whatever.  Whatever you want to throw in there.  That's what they, that's the vernacular of the time.  You, you watch, uh, the war.  Watch the war.  It's a Ken Burns special, uh, documentary on World War II. 
[00:09:00]  And it's brilliant.  It's on PBS.  And, uh, they don't pull any punches.  You hear these guys, and they say Japs and Krauts, because that's, that's what they were  talking about.  Jerry's.  You know, that's, that's the way they, they, they spoke about them, because they were the  enemy back then.  And that's what he was doing.  Yeah.  I mean, they, they talk about, they talk to these guys who had, uh, they were on flamethrower  detail on the Pacific Islands.  And just talking about how, you know, and they were interviewing these guys.  The Japs wouldn't surrender.  We had to, we had to burn them out of these caves. 
[00:09:30]  And, uh, we didn't look at them as human beings.  Uh, that's exactly the way they, they looked at these people and, and treated them.  Now, like they weren't human.  Now, our boys over in Iraq, every time they kill someone, I'm sure they have to file a  report.  Now you're right.  Exactly.  They had to file all sorts of reports to make sure it was a, it was a good kill.  Justified.  A justified kill.  That, they are in a horrible situation over there.  And every shot has to be justified.  They're, they're putting guys in jail for killing people during a war. 
[00:10:00]  You know, believe me, innocent people die.  You watch that special, like I was telling you, uh, the war.  You understand, they really did not care about civilians back then.  They would carpet bomb with incendiary bombs, known civilian, just, just apartments and buildings  that people lived in and let them just, a huge firestorm start that killed more than,  than the A-bombs that we dropped killed.  But that was to get morale down and make them surrender. 
[00:10:30]  That's what you did.  And, but now our wars and everything else have to be politically correct.  The worst thing you could have is a politically correct war because then it's just going to  make it last longer.  There shouldn't be any rules in war?  Uh, your basic Geneva Convention rules, I think, are pretty good.  I understand that.  If you're held prisoner, you shouldn't, you know, have your, uh, uh, your naughty bits in  a vice as, uh, you know, it's, it's slowly tightening.  You think they're obeying that rule, though?  No, no, no.  I think we are.  Uh, the Americans get in trouble for playing pyramid with, uh, some, some, some, 
[00:11:00]  uh, war, uh, prisoners of war in, in a prison.  But, um, God only knows what happens on the other side.  And I'm not talking about American troops either.  Just, uh, people that are on the Iraq side that are, uh, with us.  People that are with us, the police, they go through, them and their families just killed  on a daily basis.  They're being killed by insurgents just for cooperating with American soldiers. 
[00:11:30]  But, you gotta be politically correct.  You can't just, uh, kill a bunch of civilians these days.  By the way, to back up a little bit.  So, uh, the cadre said the country's going to hell.  Did he give you any, uh, specifics?  Uh, the whole thing with, um, how we celebrate, uh, these Muslim holidays and, and that how,  uh, if the Muslims had their way, we'd all be in camps getting, uh, tortured.  Really?  He brought that up.  Yeah.  He brought that up.  And then he pointed out how another car had a dent in the door and how that'll cost at 
[00:12:00]  least a thousand dollars.  Right.  He was just off in all kinds of directions.  And then he said, well, I, I need to go get some ice creamer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then it was just like, I, I was like, well, I got, I gotta go.  I'd love to talk to you all day, sir.  When you started that story.  And I called him sir when I left.  Of course.  It was nice talking to you, sir.  Of course.  And he was like, that's nice.  Yeah.  Uh, for the elderly, uh, when he started that story, before I found out that he was  a vet, I was thinking what you should have done when he said, Whoa, watch out for my  car is just say, you know what?  Take one for the team.  Bam, bam, bam.  Just open and close your door. 
[00:12:30]  Like over and over again.  And just to the horror.  Allah Akbar.  Right.  As I slam hit my door into his door.  So he just said, VAD.  You're like, ah, man, I gotta listen to this.  Of course.  That's the last thing the vets need is, is my retarded, uh, uh, anger.  Right.  Being directed at them.  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Paul, what's up?  How's it going, boy?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I just, long time listener.  I, every morning, I, you guys keep me up. 
[00:13:00]  I do a paper route and thank God for you guys or else I want to shoot myself.  Yeah.  You sound a little too old for a paper route.  Uh, a little observation there.  Yeah.  Well, I'm 30 some.  Uh, well, anyway, the, uh,  the, uh, what is that thing?  The pink?  Yeah.  That's what breast cancer awareness, no?  All right.  So Empire State Building here in New York, they, like we said, they, uh, they make it a nice  color on the top every once in a while.  Like 4th of July, it's kind of a red, white, and blue thing.  Yeah.  And, uh, pink, Anthony said was for the, for the gay. 
[00:13:30]  I thought pink was for the gay.  For the gay.  But you're saying it's for breast cancer.  And I'm thinking, shouldn't they have, uh, you know, picked like, like, uh, a structure  that has two, two things?  Oh, mm, well, we kind of lost those.  Yeah, I understand.  Yes.  But there has to be.  The gay would be a rainbow, right?  They can make the, uh, Empire State Building a rainbow.  A rainbow for the gay?  For the, for the gay?  All right.  I, I think so.  And then, uh, do they light it up?  Now, do they light it up for Christmas? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  In like a green and red kind of thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or, or is there a problem with that?  Because it's, uh, it's exclusive.  It, there's a exclusion.  We'll have to take a look, uh, this year.  Maybe they got rid of that, so.  Hey, uh, real fast, uh, uh, Ant, sorry.  Uh, Jimmy and I and our, our chicks.  Yeah.  We went out last night, man.  We, uh, went and saw a Bronx Tale.  Chaz Palminteri's, uh, one-man play here in Manhattan.  Holy S.  Amazing or what?  Holy S. 
[00:14:30]  Was it good.  Yeah.  And I gotta be honest, I see a lot of movies I've never seen a Bronx Tale.  You've never seen a Bronx Tale.  I've seen pieces of it, I guess, but I've never sat down and watched the whole thing for some reason.  I realized that yesterday.  And you thought it was really good, the, um, the, uh, play.  I thought it was amazing.  Now, Jimmy, you saw the movie?  Saw the movie.  And the play.  Okay, so what did you think, going into it, uh, having seen the movie?  Well, it's the same story.  I mean, it follows, it's just, it's him.  I was amazed watching how great he is as an actor.  Yeah.  It's like he, he's, it's like an hour and a half, hour and 40 minutes. 
[00:15:00]  It's not boring.  He's alone on stage.  There's a few sound effects, but it's him.  And he's not acting out the parts in a cheesy way.  He's like telling a story.  And in the story, it's like, um, so I'm talking to Anthony.  And Anthony's like, hey, what do you do?  It's like, he just becomes these guys in a very natural story.  Without over the top, turn around and go, and it would look something like this.  It's not an imitation of somebody.  He was changing his mannerisms and his voices on a dime.  And you could completely follow along. 
[00:15:30]  Like he had a few scenes where he was, uh, doing four or five guys at the same, not at  the same time, but boom, boom, back and forth.  And you're like, whoa, wow.  Is it like a guy telling a really good story, I guess?  Really good story.  And it's a, it's a very simple set.  And it's just Chaz Palminteri for an hour and 35 minutes.  No break.  No intermission.  I got to see this.  So, it was so good, man.  Yeah.  It was so good.  It was amazing.  I usually don't like plays either.  I very rarely.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan.  Is that, uh, running for any length of time?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah?  You can go anytime you want.  All right.  I got to see that.  We were-  I'm a huge Chaz Palminteri fan.  It was really amazing.  And, uh, uh, Jimmy's girl said that, Jimmy, you had a little tear in your eye.  Oh!  Well, you know, no, it was just watching such a great actor do, do what he does without  any shame, without any embarrassment.  It was like, just, you're watching a master.  Like, this is a guy who can act with De Niro or Pacino and not be uncomfortable with  him.  Like, that's the level that you're watching.  It's like, geez, this guy is just great.  It was great. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  It was great.  That, one, uh, one observation, though, they should have had a metal detector going into  the joint.  I'm like, where-  What's that?  Where did all these wise guys come from to see this play last night?  Oh, yeah?  A lot of-  Oh, wow!  He pointed that out to me.  He comes over and he said that they should have a metal detector.  I'm like, why?  He goes, look around.  Look around.  A lot of goombas came out of the woodwork.  We were, uh, you know, we were absolutely the minority.  I mean, these guys came out of the-  I mean, I thought it was, you know, this old gag, but it makes sense.  It looked like a casting call for, like, the Sopranos. 
[00:17:00]  Literally.  I mean, it was like-  It was amazing.  Yeah.  It was amazing how many Italians were in there.  Yeah, they loved it.  Of course.  He got a standing ovation.  I mean, an instant standing ovation.  Yeah, yeah.  The minute he came back out.  People couldn't wait to get off their seats.  It wasn't one of those slow builds.  It was like, wow!  Everyone stood up at the same time.  It was great.  Yeah.  It was really great.  And another observation, before the play, we're kind of hanging out on the sidewalk and  waiting for Jimmy's chick.  And I officially have to say, Jimmy's really in love. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah?  Jimmy's in love.  I saw Jimmy be a man yesterday.  What'd you do?  She got mouthy and-  Well, she jumps out of a cab and says hi and comes up and says hi, whatever, right?  All of a sudden, she realizes that she left her wallet in the cab.  Oh, no.  And she goes into an instant panic like anyone would.  And she starts pointing like it.  Well, she sees a cab and she goes running and knocks on the window like I left my wallet  in the cab and then realizes it's not the same cab. 
[00:18:00]  Well, they do.  Goes into a panic.  She's got kind of like girly shoes.  Not kind of.  She's got girly shoes on.  She can't-  Girl boots.  She can't run in these things with heels and stuff.  So she looks at Jimmy like, my wallet, it's in that cab.  And she points to a cab that honestly is 50 yards up the road and the light's turning  green.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Jimmy just slow motion.  Dude, that's-  I got it, sweetheart.  You weren't even there.  You described it perfectly.  Jimmy didn't even think. 
[00:18:30]  It was like his girl, her wallet, he needs to get that wallet.  And he takes off.  And then there was, I watched the whole thing go down.  You actually stop like, oh, man, there's no way I'm doing this.  Like, because the cab is going through a green.  Oh, no.  So you kind of stop a little bit.  He stops for a second.  But then he thought about it a little more.  He thought for a second and said, F it.  I'm going for it, man.  And then I see him running, like, across two lanes of traffic.  It's a green light.  It's like cars are zooming in and out.  And there's Jimmy.  Like, he talks about this stupid- 
[00:19:00]  Go, Jimmy.  Go.  He talks about this stupid foot of his that he can't do anything.  I ask him to walk home.  We walk home every once in a while.  But half the time he can't because he has this dumb foot problem.  And there was no foot problem yesterday.  He had to take care of his girl, man.  He's just hauling.  It's Times Square, too.  You know how that gets.  And also, I'm like, no way.  We're all watching in amazement.  And then he, like, disappears.  And I'm just waiting.  We're all waiting.  And I see him, like, walking down the sidewalk with his chick, arm in arm, happiness everywhere. 
[00:19:30]  I'm like, oh, my God.  He was successful.  He actually got the job done.  Yeah, I wound up.  You know what helped me?  That was the fact that it was one of those stupid cabs in New York here.  They have painted the back, like, multicolors.  Yeah, little flowery things.  And there was only a couple on the street, the cabs that were like that.  And she had gotten out of one.  So I was able to not need to look in, like, three or four cabs in a row.  And I bolted across.  It was between 8th Avenue and Broadway. 
[00:20:00]  So it went over Broadway.  And between Broadway and 7th is not that long.  So he started to go through the second light.  And he slowed down at the...  Wait, so you ran how far?  About a block and a half or whatever.  A block and a half running at full speed.  It was a long block and a half.  Yeah.  He took off, man.  Were you winded?  Nah, it was all right.  I mean, I told you that's the advantage of dating an athlete.  You know, it's when you need these things done.  And then Jimmy whispers to me as we're going into the joint to see a Bronxdale.  He goes, oh, I'll be using this to my advantage for the next few months.  Oh, honey. 
[00:20:30]  And then he's back to Jimmy.  I love it.  I think I pulled something running.  She was really happy, though.  It was pretty cool to see, to be honest with you.  Hey, speaking of a Bronxdale, Chaz is coming in on Friday.  Yeah.  He wanted someone from the show to see the play first.  Probably so we could discuss it.  Yeah.  Bragging about it.  Right.  Goddamn it was that good.  I'll tell you the truth.  If we didn't like the play, we would have kind of, like, quietly, you know, passed on Chaz or something.  The play was amazing.  We can't wait to talk to him on Friday.  So, yeah, there you go.  All right.  We'll break on time today. 
[00:21:00]  What the hell, Thane?  Wow, Thane.  Look at what you're getting.  Phone call Thursday.  Fun fact Thursday.  Chance to win $1,000 for all those dopes out there that don't even like the show, but they're listening to win $1,000.  Yeah.  They're going to make you wait through the commercial to find out what today's sound is that you're listening for.  That's what we do.  That's what we do now.  To all the prize pigs that don't even give a crap what we're saying through your radio.  Phone number 877.  We don't even have to give it out.  What am I saying?  Look at this.  We're going to get to nobody today. 
[00:21:30]  Just found you on the radio.  Oh, brother.  What?  Hold on.  On the wireless.  We might go late there, Thane.  Joe, Jersey, what's up?  Too good to be true.  Joe.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  No, I'm being honest with you.  I am a radio freaking whore.  I bounce around WDHA.  I hang around with Jim Monaghan and the boys up there.  But years ago, I used to listen.  And I'll tell you the reason why.  When you guys did a contest for chicks' asses, one of my buddies, Little Ragu, Steve Scavone, 
[00:22:00]  his sister, Allison Scavone, she had a dynamite ass contest.  And recently, after like 20 freaking years of not hanging out with him, I stopped at his  house, I don't know, about a year and a half ago.  And he actually worked for me part-time.  He's one of them computer whizzers.  I'm a contractor.  What the hell is this?  It is phone call Thursday.  You got to relax, Ed.  Oh, I just, I called up.  I told the guy who answered the phone.  I said, this is a belated welcome back. 
[00:22:30]  But I didn't even know you guys were, I'm so freaking busy all the time.  I didn't even know you guys were back on until about three days ago, my buddy told me.  And the only reason we let him babble for a while here, because I want to now make a  point, I was talking to Tracy on the way.  Someone is.  I was talking to Tracy walking out of this joint yesterday here in New York, and she  goes, believe it or not, there's still a lot of people that have no idea that Opie  and Anthony are back on regular radio.  I'm like, you're insane.  Yeah, a lot of us out here.  And the only reason I took this call is because we were having this conversation yesterday  leaving this. 
[00:23:00]  You know, at the studio.  And I'm like, how is that possible?  You know how it's possible?  Because we used to do a few things, very few things, but they would get us in trouble  or get us in the news, and then people would know that we were on the air.  Now you can't do it because you lose your job.  So it's very hard to do that.  I would love to do something that would kind of get us in the news, get people talking about  us in a negative way.  It's fine by me.  I don't care.  But nowadays, it's hard.  Well, you go ahead and tell everybody what I was thinking. 
[00:23:30]  Go ahead.  Go, go.  I'd turn them down.  It's just get people conscious of the show.  But like I said, you just get into trouble.  The second you put yourself in the public eye and really make a splash at something, for  some reason you just get in trouble for it.  And some group gets offended and you're on the brink of or getting fired.  So it's kind of hard to do these days.  All right.  Well, Joe, thanks.  I'm glad you finally found us.  It's so weird you called today because we were just discussing this. 
[00:24:00]  And I had no idea yesterday.  It's unbelievable.  I actually hooked up with a phone.  I would assume.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Good morning, Buffalo.  How are you today?  Hey, Buffalo.  I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on The Edge, a fine radio station that gets  the Opie and Anthony show, works the Opie and Anthony show, makes it part of their community  up there in Buffalo.  Shred and Reagan doing a great job for us.  They do afternoons in Buffalo and they're promoting the hell out of our contest. 
[00:24:30]  Huh?  I'm talking to those guys today, I think.  Are you really?  Yeah, they promote the HBO DVD and stuff.  Oh, right on, man.  Stand up guys all the way.  And they're promoting the hell out of us and we greatly appreciate it.  It didn't go unnoticed.  And speaking of the contest, Sean and Boston, of course, we're giving away $1,000 a day.  Got to listen for a sound clip.  Sean from Boston has something.  Yes, Sean.  Hey.  Hey, how you doing?  I just want to tell you guys I love your show, Jimmy.  First things first, I just wanted to say that you should don't replay the sound clip. 
[00:25:00]  Let the true listeners that listen to your show every day, because I heard it yesterday  and I'm sure all the true listeners that listen to your show have listened to it.  So I want to replay the sound clip for today instead of those little contests for us.  All the contest pigs, prize pigs.  I understand what you're saying.  Oh, I heard it.  We said we would play the clip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For all the prize pigs that are just tuning in.  Yeah.  So they know what to listen for when we do the contest between 7 and 7.30. 
[00:25:30]  What Sean is saying is, screw the prize pigs.  The people that really are faithful to the show and listen to your show already know what the sound is.  So let a real listener win today.  Oh, I thought he said we had two listeners.  What?  I thought it sounded like he said, let your two listeners.  No.  And that's all I heard.  And I was ready to get very angry with Sean from Boston.  You're true listeners.  You know, Sean, I agree with you.  There's nothing in the rules that says I have to replay the sound clip just because I said I would play it after the break. 
[00:26:00]  So I'm with you, Sean.  All right.  All right.  You want to give him the battle cry?  What's that?  Well, look where he's from.  Oh, yeah.  Go, Sox.  Goal.  Big game tonight, man.  Big game.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Sox.  We can do it.  Big comeback.  About to happen.  We can do it.  That's right.  Hey, if Tim Wakefield could throw a 30-mile-an-hour fastball, so can I.  Suit me up.  I'm ready, coach.  I could throw 30 miles an hour.  If you got a little extra money laying around people. 
[00:26:30]  Awful me from Wackbag.  We were talking about Jimmy saving, you know, finding his, well, running after a cab.  Yeah.  To get his chick's wallet back.  Chivalry is not dead.  Certainly isn't.  And I was amazed.  But it has AIDS.  Yes, it does.  I was amazed at how quick Jimmy was and how fast he was running down the street.  Was he zigging and zagging between cars?  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah?  Bobbing and weaving. 
[00:27:00]  Were you rolling across the hoods and stuff like in Lethal Weapon?  I was very virile.  Yeah.  Oh.  And I even pulled a weapon on one person.  I'm like, get out of the car!  Get out of the car!  Like Gary Busey when you eat it or not.  I was like, Mr. Joshua.  I don't want to know that you were virile.  Very virile.  I can feel it pumping through my body.  It's not easy to run when you're in that state.  You were heroic.  You were heroic.  She kept joking and calling me her hero.  Yes.  And I was like, oh, come on. 
[00:27:30]  Smooch, smooch.  And we described it like, you know, all of a sudden it was kind of like this slow motion  thing happening.  Yeah.  As Jimmy's deciding, should I go for it or not across, you know, two lanes of traffic,  blah, blah, blah.  Well, awful me from Whackbag, you're right.  That wasn't slow motion.  He just isn't fast.  Oh.  She, um, we got stuck next to, and part of my reward for my heroism, and it was basically  just ignoring what could have been my own death, was we had to sit in an aisle seat  and a regular seat, and she got stuck next to the fattest man south of Massachusetts. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  He was blubbering into her seat with his suit jacket, and she was human.  Because she's loud.  She doesn't mean to be, but she'll whisper, like, this guy's in my seat.  I'm like, I know, good whisper job.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now he's going to punch me in the face.  Thanks.  He couldn't have lifted his arms to punch anybody.  He was just a big fat man.  Had he eaten a lot of, like, ah, ah, ah, maybe that was it.  No, he didn't seem like a big Italian guy.  He just seemed like some lawyerly, uh. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  But I felt bad, because my girlfriend went to the bathroom, and, like, we had little  snacks that I bought, and the guy's companion, the chick he was with, goes, oh, we'll  watch your, we'll watch the snacks, ha, ha, ha.  Like, try to be light about it.  Oh, right, yeah.  And I felt like they know.  Yeah.  Of course they know.  Even though he was annoying, and it wasn't me, I had to sit next to him, but.  No offense, but this is so predictable, because when you went to the bathroom, before the  play started, a Bronx tale, um, she came over to me and said, oh, Jimmy's not going 
[00:29:00]  to be happy.  I'm like, why?  There is a huge fat guy sitting next to me.  This is exactly what, excuse me, I'm burping here.  Uh, this is exactly what Jimmy hates.  Did he use the leg lift to lift his leg up, uh, into the, maybe into his lap to cross  his leg?  They had to crane him in.  They craned him into his seat.  And then, and then she goes, I'm going to have to sit there, because he, he will be so  annoyed that he's, there's no way he'll be able to enjoy the play, knowing that this  atrocity is sitting next to him. 
[00:29:30]  She was right.  So she had to take the bullet, but then again, she's a lot, uh, thinner than you, and she  can move over to your side a little bit.  That was what she did.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, you sit all the way back in your seat, but I mean, again, I felt bad for the guy,  because they are tiny little theater seats.  They're not big, but you have to basically be 155 pounds to feel good.  They should make them a little bigger for people that are just taller.  But in the-  Yeah, this theater, I mean, you were squished in.  You were like a small-  It was not comfortable whatsoever.  I was lucky to have an aisle seat, too, so he could kind of stretch out a little bit.  But I can't imagine being stuck in the middle of a row in that theater. 
[00:30:00]  But being that it was like an hour and a half, which is fine.  Like, a lot of times, plays are three hours, and you're like, oh, Jesus.  And you have to get up, and then try to get back.  Yeah.  Hour and a half.  Intermission.  Enough about the play!  You're clapping.  You're done.  Huh?  La, la, la, la.  Speaking of fat people.  Oh.  Perfect time for this.  Leftover from yesterday.  The smell of potato skins lingers on me now  I've got a big grease stain on my new nightgown 
[00:30:30]  I need some ice cream for my own satisfaction, baby  To go with my salty chips, my Pepsi, and my chicken gravy  Oh, yeah.  I'm dreaming about it.  Come to Mama.  I hope you know 
[00:31:00]  I hope you know  My diet's nothing but fatty foods  It's beautiful  My thighs are huge  I've got some stuff in my veins to do  But I want some biscuits  With my pigs in a blanket  But mine gotta be salty and deep-fried  It's time to hit the BK now  Cause big girls deep-fried 
[00:31:30]  I call shotgun  What is this?  It's a Zucra bit  This is your Morning Zoo bit of the day  Leftover from yesterday  Oh  See, that's why I was confused  Cause it's not Morning Zoo Bits' day  Well, this is Leftover from yesterday  This is a terrific song that they're playing like crazy  In Indianapolis  Oh, Indianapolis  They think this is just amazing  I wonder, okay  I would say  Big girls eat fries  I mean, she does a fine job saying the dumb thing  But who gives a crap? 
[00:32:00]  It's not awful  It's not great  You know how many people are in their cars right now  Uncomfortable going, what is this?  Yeah, yeah  What are they doing?  What?  It should be really awful if we're gonna play it  Like some of them are really  Like the ones that they play from Scott and Todd  Are really bad  Horrid  Those are really bad  We could play one from their show every day  And not get bored with it  Yeah, you're probably right  We could have done a little better job with that  Cause that was like  Ah, it's just a chick singing a silly song about being fat  Ah, she doesn't know any better  She's a chick 
[00:32:30]  Ah, she's a fat girl  Yeah  Looking for fries  Being fat  Yeah  I've heard worse  Yeah  Ah, there you go  There's one for the prize picks  Hey, internet clip of the day  We saw one on Break.com this morning  The front page of Break.com  Yeah, funny stuff  Friends of the show  And they have a bathroom mirror prank you should check out today  It's really, really good  It's in German, I guess  Right  That's why I heard the audio only  When Ope started it up at his desk 
[00:33:00]  And I thought it was going to be some kind of a disgusting porno  Cause whenever I hear German on the internet  I just automatically assume it's disgusting pornography  Right  That would need like 20 showers for everyone involved afterwards  But no  It was like a candid camera kind of a prank  And they got the subtitles  Basically it's a bathroom  And you got this woman  Leaning toward the mirror  Putting lipstick on 
[00:33:30]  Yeah  This is what's interesting  There's no mirror there  Even though it looks like she's looking at herself  In the mirror  Yep  What it is, is a pane of glass  And on the other side of the pane of glass  Is her twin sister  Her identical twin sister  In an identical room  Right  In reverse  Right  To look like it's a mirror  And yeah  Her twin sister's right across from her  And they gotta choreograph pretty well  Because she's making the same moves as her sister 
[00:34:00]  And her sister has to do everything left handed  Yeah  And it's in front of like sinks in a bathroom  Right  A public bathroom  So when people walk in  They use the sink or whatever  And then they look up to see themselves in the mirror  And they don't see anything  Cause it's just a pane of glass  But then they look at the woman  And she's got a reflection  Cause her twin sister's on the other side  Wow  Doing a real good job matching  And they just can't figure it out  They're asking her  Do you see me  I don't see me  And she goes  I can't see myself  Then stand over here 
[00:34:30]  And check if you can see me  I see you  But not myself  Yeah  She goes  Can I stand where you're standing  Cause my side  One woman said her side of the mirror  Didn't work  Right  So can I  And so she moves over  To where the sisters  Are doing their prank  And of course  She can't see herself still  And some of these people  Are completely freaked out  Like what is going on  Yeah  So you might want to check it out  When you get to work today  It's break.com  Front page  It's called  Absolutely Hilarious Bathroom Mirror Prank

Hi  I was just calling  To comment  I'm a long time listener  And this contest  Has been such an eye opener  To these prize pigs  I never realized  How many people  Had nothing better to do  Than go and research  These contests  And call radio stations  All morning long  Don't these people  Have jobs?  It's uh  It's it's  That's a good question  No they don't have jobs  I gotta tell you  I miss doing radio  In Boston  Because like we explained 
[00:37:00]  When this contest started  There was a unique  A unique thing  Going on there  All radio station numbers  Were like one or two  Off from each other  So you've  You had people  Calling your radio show  All the time  That was trying to  That were trying to  Win prizes from  Other stations up there  Anthony and I  Used to mess with  Prize pigs  Almost on a regular basis  Remember like  Constantly getting  Those wrong numbers  What was it?  W-R-K-O  Was giving away  Turkeys for Thanksgiving?  I want a turkey  Yeah you want a turkey  Do ya?  I remember that old lady  How are you going to

[00:44:30]  So  They just whack you  I love how corporate doesn't give a crap  That people might actually be listening to a show  And they're getting into a show  And they feel a connection with the show  It's like ah  Done with that variety  We're moving on  And we're not telling anyone  That they're losing a show they actually like  And then the ratings came out for Detroit  Had a nice bump up  Yeah  Really  Doesn't matter anymore though  They're all sports  It's like when Henry Hill's backing out of his driveway  Right  In his car  It's like  If that would have been a corporate executive  We'd have been off a station already  That's exactly what it's like man 
[00:45:00]  You just  You don't see it coming  It just happens  There was a little bump up in Detroit  Yeah a little bit  You know  We were doing a 30 share  Well  It's a little bump  In one of the demos  We were moving in the right direction  Yep  What are you going to do  Marsha  This business completely sucks  You know  I'll be out of it  Hopefully sooner than later  Because I can't stand this crap anymore  Where are you going?  What are you doing?  I'm moving back to New York  So  Alright  God bless you Marsha  Wow she does like the show  I appreciate that 
[00:45:30]  Right  There's no loyalty  There's no  There's no men  Left in radio  Whoa wait a minute  You got in this  You got in this for the men  You guys get into radio for chicks  Most guys get into it for the chicks and free CDs  No men  Now behind the scenes for the most part  There's a few  Because I'm sure Tom will run in and go  I'm a man  I get it Tom  You need your attention  But for the most part  There's no real men left in this business 
[00:46:00]  They're a bunch of cowards  They don't know what it means to be a man  So they hide  They don't call you  They don't give you any clue on what's going on  Of course I'm talking about Philly  And of course I'm talking  Call you  And of course I'm talking about the PD  Who said you know  A fan of the show  We're going to be in contact  He's going to be sending lots of emails  He's psyched to work with us  He's a good friend of Tim Sabian  And he knows  He's busy over there  How Tim worked the Opie and Anthony show in Philly  He's not a man  He's hiding  Maybe he's busy 
[00:46:30]  I made it perfectly clear  That we would like to talk to the guy  And he's still hiding  There's no men left in radio  You haven't gotten an email  Or a phone call yet  Of course not  And let me tell you something  Neither have I  Let me tell you something about Philly  If they think they know what they're doing  Oh I got a doozy for Philly  Oh  Have Dan Gross on standby  For a fine little interview  And a fine little idea I got  Oh  Oh do I got a doozy  If they think they know what they're doing in Philly  Oh do I have a doozy 
[00:47:00]  I love threats  I like  It's not even a threat  It's not  It's a promise  It's not even a threat  I don't know what it is  It's not even a threat  Can I prove what a long time listener I am  I will prove that we have a huge audience in Philly  It's not even a threat  Okay  I remember the 55 gallon drum challenge  Yep  Thank you Marcia  You're welcome  But seriously there's no men left in this business  They're all a bunch of cowards  They don't know what it means to be a man  Oh no they stand around  They hold up break signs every so often 
[00:47:30]  Yep  It's my job  Do you think this is fun  I would think so  You get to make colorful signs every day  You get to try your arts and crafts  Why wouldn't it be fun  Arts and crafts  Right  I see his budget  Paper  Sharpie  That's right  I bet you he has a little checklist of things he needs to walk in studio  And he'll check  Sharpie  Where's the paper  Oh I just checked on it  Here it is  I'm stupid  That's all Than needs  Is his marker  His paper 
[00:48:00]  And sociopathic hatred of the mother figure  Of mother  Of mother  But you know  Just to finish up  Today's rant  You know  You sit across like conference tables  From these guys  That kiss your ass  And say you're the future  Blah blah blah  And then they turn around  And completely blow you off  And cut off all communication  That is not being a man  Yeah  That's being a you know what  You know  Wow  You know  I think there's a couple of words  You know  I just wish people  Would be more honest  I would say  I agree with you about that 
[00:48:30]  I wish people would just be a little bit more upfront  And just say what's on their mind  Without being aggressive or confrontational  Just say what's on their mind  And this is  This is what I tell corporate  I don't hide  You know  It gets me in trouble all the time  Speaking my stupid mind  Maybe I should shut up  But  I tell corporate  Like  It's not like you have some  You know  Just some hack  Show that  That's not working  And then you get rid of them  Never talk to them again  We're still a huge part of this company  And they treat you like that  They take you off stations  Without telling you  And all of a sudden  Like Pittsburgh and Detroit 
[00:49:00]  Calls like  Hey what happened to you  And they're like  What do you mean what happened to us  And then we have to find out  From our listeners on the air  That we're not even broadcasting  In their city anymore  Keeps it exciting  It's ridiculous  Yeah but it really is like  Being married  And you come home  And you get naked  And you jump on the bed  And you land on pillows  And you're like  Oh I thought my woman was here  What happened  No she just left  No explanation  No nothing  Right  She flipped formats  Now she's playing urban  There you go  This is a great radio show  It'll always be a great radio show 
[00:49:30]  And we will always have an audience  For this effing radio show  And boy do I have a doozy for Philly  Can't wait for you to play your card  Because I got a fine hand  Waiting to be played  Oh boy  It's Opie and Anthony  Pocketsis  Yeah  Groups and peppers  Letting the music establish  While you walk back  Zipping up your fly 
[00:50:00]  What happened  You're just snapping our fingers  What happened really  Huh  We're back from break already  Yep  Yeah that was fast  Weird  Relatively speaking  God this guy just doesn't listen  Mike in Philly really fast  Because we've got a real busy show today  Go  Yo what's up man  That's Mike  You guys are trying to get out of Philly man  I mean that's kind of not cool dude  I mean there's nothing else going on  Down here on the radio  Preston and Steve are crap  You guys can't leave Philly man  Just don't do it  It's not up to us 
[00:50:30]  It's up to YSP  And this company we work for  We're not trying to get out of Philly  We want to continue in Philly  We want to continue on YSP  We have a huge  A long history with YSP  We think Preston and Steve suck  We really do  It's not even a jealousy thing  I mean  No one understands why they got such huge ratings  I'm sorry  But it's not  It's not a show that  That should have  As big of an audience as they have  And it's simple as that  And it's stupefying everybody 
[00:51:00]  Because it's really just  Hacky who gives a crap radio  You know  I mean I'll give Howard his props  When Howard was huge  And Philly getting massive numbers  Yeah  You listen  You go  Yeah  Okay  I get it  This is why a lot of people  Are listening to this show  You know  Yeah  But Preston and Steve  It sucks  But for some reason  That's what Philly likes right now  And we're trying to turn that around  Slowly but surely here  He's just talking  I can't tell you why people like it man  It's just  They're glorified interns 
[00:51:30]  I don't even know what the heck to call them  They're just  They're crap  Right but I'll tell you this much  You know  If YSP  If they get stupid  And get rid of us  Trust me  I got a doozy waiting for them  A doozy  I hope you guys are around  So I can hear it man  Alright  And I hope it doesn't come down to that  I'll be honest  But if it does  So be it  So be it  Alright Mike  Thank you  Hey Ant  Hey Ant  Yeah  Right  Click  Mike  Who's trying to get me  Alright  I knew it  I saw it coming 
[00:52:00]  So it didn't work  Hardy  Har  Hey there's an interesting thing  In the New York paper  I bet you this is all over  The country today  The Google search  The Google  I can't even hear  The Google  Without thinking of  Stupid President Bush  Saying  Sometimes I  I use the Google  Right right  The Google  Well everyone uses  The Google  The Google  And they did a huge survey  On what people are searching  All over the world 
[00:52:30]  And it's really  Really interesting  It's really interesting  And they put keywords in  They could have used  Better words by the way  But  But  Like for example  They threw Tom Cruise  Like  How many people  Googled Tom Cruise  Right  And where are these  And where are these  Searches coming from  I'm going with the easy one  Yeah  Just to get the bit going  You're absolutely right  Anthony  Number one country  That Googles Tom Cruise  Is Canada  Yeah I read that one  And then the United States  That makes perfect sense  Canada  Why does that make sense 
[00:53:00]  Why  Because  What else is Canada  Like Googling  Like there's nothing more important  Than Tom Cruise  Going on  You would think  Hockey  They would Google  Hockey  Well they do Google hockey  But when it comes to  Googling  Tom Cruise  Canada  Does it more than  Any other country  In the world  And then it's  The United States  Australia  Peru  India  India  Peru  And India  Like Tom Cruise  So then you  Move on to  Hangover 
[00:53:30]  Hangover  How many people  A lot of people  Google Hangover  But what is the  Number one country  That Googles Hangover  That Googles Hangover  United States  You would think  Ireland  Actually it's not even  It's countries  It's also cities  Oh  For this one  It's cities  Okay  New York  New York  New York is second  Indonesia  Beating out Boston  By the way  Which is third  Oh wow  More people in New York 
[00:54:00]  Google Hangover  Than Boston  How much bigger  Is New York  Than Boston  It's amazing  Yeah that's a good point  Drunks  And then you got  San Francisco  And then Chicago  But the number one  Place in the world  That Googles Hangover  Moscow  Moscow  They like their vodka  But they don't get hungover  This is what I have to say  For Moscow  Goodness gracious  Goodness gracious  To you  Are you insane  Moscow  I screwed up  Smooth as silk 
[00:54:30]  Wasn't it  Yeah  Dublin  Dublin  Okay  That makes more sense  Right  There you go  Okay  So it is Ireland  Britney Spears  People googling  Britney Spears  All over the world  What country Googles  Britney Spears  More than any  Or what place  In the world  Googles  Britney Spears  I thought you guys  Were kissing  Holy crap  That was so creepy  They wouldn't do it  In public like that  Oh my god  What the F  My mind  Just threw me  A curve ball 
[00:55:00]  No no no  I'm looking at Anthony  And I can see Jimmy  You know  Out the left side  Of my eyes here  Right  And I'm focusing  With Anthony  We're doing a thing  I see Than walk  Across the studio  Lean in  And I thought him  And Jimmy were kissing  Wait a C block  I had a question for Sam  But I had to whisper to him  And he leaned in  So I could  You know  Dude  That was the weird  My mind just played  A massive trick on me  I'm like  What is going on  I want to see that later  Alright anyway  Britney Spears  I would say either 
[00:55:30]  Is it cities or country  Ah  Because I would say  Either somewhere in England  Or the United States  This is more of a country thing  England  England doesn't even make  The top five  As far as Googling Britney Spears  And believe it or not  The United States  Fifth place on this one  Fifth  Japan  Uh  Japan  I just figured  They're like  You know  They got some kind of  Perversion over there  For that kind of thing  It's kind of funny  Britney Spears  The number one country  That Googles Britney Spears 
[00:56:00]  Yeah  Mexico  Mexico  Why would they  They're a big fan  Traditional Mexican music  Mexico is a big fan  Of the oopsie  Wow  Yeah  Mexico  How weird is that  Because they see the oopsie  And they figure  That's a good way  To smuggle people  Over the border  Reminds them of  The Rio Grande  Yeah  It's like  You know how many people  We can get in there  Maybe if she gets out of the car  We can all jump out  No one will see nothing  Oh it's Mexican Jimmy  Yeah  You know  I do little accents  Yeah  But that doesn't really  Sound too Mexican  It just sounds like 
[00:56:30]  A very bad  Cheech and Chong  It really is  You're doing Cheech  Yeah  New character though  Come on  Cheech Jimmy  Yeah  Yeah  Mexico  Is the number one country  That Googles Britney Spears  That's what they should be Googling  Britney Spears  And then it's  Venezuela  Canada  Peru  United States  The South American countries  Speaking places  Yeah  The South Americans  Yeah  Absolutely love the Britney Spears  Alright here  This is where it gets interesting  You got Iraq  Gay 
[00:57:00]  Then you got sex  Then you got Viagra  Which one do you want  Which one do you want  Um  Uh  Sex  Sex  Number one country  Googling  Sex  Believe it or not  United States  Not even in the top five  Really  No cause the United States  Probably more specific  Yeah you know how to  Google  You don't google  Sex  That's a childlike way  Of nakedness  Sex  Tee  Right here  And then you hit  You hit  Enter 
[00:57:30]  Yeah men know what  They're looking for  Yeah you gotta  Be a little more specific  Couple seeking M  Unquote  You know you just  Brought up something  That just reminded me  When I was growing up  My thing  My thing to get off  As a little kid  Was to go to the dictionary  And look up dirty words  Yeah  That was like  Yeah  That was like  Hardcore porn for me  When I was young  That was going  That was googling  You were googling words  Cause you'd look up  Bad words  And then read the definition  And chuckle  As a kid  Right  Me and my buddy 
[00:58:00]  In high school  Would be in social studies  And his name is Brian  And one of us  Would look at the other one  And like mouth  Page 255  Paragraph 2  Section 1  And then we would just  Like  Then I would look down  And I would read  And it would say  So then the man  Came home  And I would laugh  At any double entendre  That might be in there  Like it was  The dumbest stuff  Me and my stupid friend  Would point out to each other  But that would be like  Hardcore like porn  Just giggling  For a kid  This is high school though 
[00:58:30]  You could find some  Great words in the dictionary  That could get you  A little you know what  Yeah  You had to get  What you could back then  But you make a good point  Stupid me  I'm like  Wow  Surprise  United States  Not one of the big  Big searches of the word sex  But you're right  We're more specific  And we're not like  Third graders  Yeah  In this country  We know what we want  You ready for this  Romania  Fifth place  As far as googling  The word sex  That figures  Poland  Okay  Turkey  Yeah  It all makes perfect sense 
[00:59:00]  India  Wow  And number one  Googling the word sex  Egypt  Egypt  Egypt  When they google it  It's S-E-C-T-S  Sex  It's a little too highbrow  Jimmy  What?

[00:59:30]  That's how they would do it  In the Middle East  Because they don't  They're perverts  Right yeah  Not advanced computer perverts  They're sex  Right  Just  Yeah  Quickly  Yeah quick before someone  Stones you  Rest  Search  Oh Alan's crying again  Are we going to get Marjohn  From the little shelter  For an expert  Oh I hope so  Can I tell you how much  Alright we'll talk about that later  Yeah  Now we got left  Iraq  Gay  And Viagra  Iraq  Has to be the United States 
[01:00:00]  Come on  Iraq  Yes  Number one is the United States  Yeah  Googling Iraq  Second what  Australia  Oh yeah they got some people over there  Canada  Canada  What about England  United Kingdom  Yeah  And then Italy  Italy  The rest of the world  Couldn't be bothered  I don't care  They'd rather just put in sex  Right  What about  You want gay or Viagra  I'm not gonna  I'm not gonna fall for that old gag  I say we go with gay  Alright  Alright gay 
[01:00:30]  Number one place  In the world  Googling the  The word gay  Gay  And I'll just get out of the way  Cause I know a lot of people  Say San Francisco  That's in fourth place  Fourth place  New York's in third by the way  Well in San Francisco  To google gay  You just type in  Any words  With San Francisco  After them  It could be anything  It could be bridge  San Francisco  And somehow  Homosexuality will pop up  The bridge  It's the gentleman  Between two other gentlemen  The gay 
[01:01:00]  So San Francisco's in fourth  New York's in third  And fifth is Lima  Peru  Or Lima  I say Lima  Lima  I know it's Lima  I like Lima  Then in second place  I like Lima beans  Googling the gay  Is Mexico City  Boy the Mexicans  What's going on with that  What's going on with that  Mexico  Yeah  Into Britney Spears  And the gay  And then you got  San Diego  Chile  Chile yeah  In Chile  Yeah they're number one 
[01:01:30]  As far as  Putting gay  In the old google search  Does it mean anything else  In that language  Or no  It doesn't mean  Gay in Chile  Don't speak English  Oh maybe  Maybe it means like  You know  It's a different word  Yeah watch it be  Some religious  Yeah  Symbol  Hey by the way  I didn't read the article  And I should have  I'm just looking at  The pretty graphs here  That's what most people do  Right  Germany meanwhile  Comes in first place  For searching  Hitler  Germany searches  Hitler a lot  And that's really interesting 
[01:02:00]  Because if you  If you read up on Germany  What's going on  In their culture  They  You can't mention  Hitler  You can't  No  The whole swastika thing  That is like  It's a no no  Obviously everywhere  We understand that  But in Germany  It's a  It is like  A major crime  To even refer  To any of that stuff  They don't call it  Memorabilia over there  But from the safety  Of their homes  In Germany  They're the number one  You know  Search for the word  Hitler  On Google  And also  Holocaust deniers  Are not allowed 
[01:02:30]  In Germany  Yes  But they're there  Do you know  Look at a little  Side track here  A quarter of Germans  Believe there were  Some positive aspects  To Nazi rule  According to a poll  Published Wednesday  A finding that comes out  After a popular talk show  Was fired for praising  Nazi Germany  Germany's attitude  Toward motherhood  I guess  Someone got into  A bit of a problem  But yeah  A quarter of Germans  Believe that some  Positive aspects 
[01:03:00]  Came out of Nazi rule  You got to be very careful  When you say things like this  Because you get a sound bite  Or a clip like that  But a lot of innovation  Came out of Nazi rule  That is used today  A lot of inventions  Came out of Nazi Germany  Our interstate system  The interstate system  Was based on  The Nazis' highways 
[01:03:30]  And Hitler's idea  Of the  You know  The Autobahn  Mechanization  Of industry  The Germans  Very good engineers  Very good  Machinists  Are you  So that came  I'm just saying  These are things  That came out of  World War II  Are you trying to rally  The troops  One by one here  What happened  Are you trying to start  A new movement  Or something  What also happened 
[01:04:00]  Is the other countries  Stepped up  Especially the United States  Who was pretty much  Stuck in the 20s  And early 30s  Still  As far as technology went  And then they just  You know  Blew past  Everybody  As far as technology goes  But the Germans  Initially  They were  They were still  Flying around  We were still  Flying around  In biplanes  And stuff  And they came up  With some pretty  Kick ass aircraft  And stuff  It's just some  Good things 
[01:04:30]  Come out of  Very bad situations  And  Someone got in trouble  For saying that  Perhaps they didn't  Say it as eloquently  As I did  Or as defensively  But what you said  Is right though  Because  It's obviously  There's no way  To defend Germans  But you know what  We look at Rome  And ancient Rome  And they were conquerors  Yeah  The Romans were not  Nice people  No  Their goal  Was world domination  If you saw  The Roman army  Coming toward your border  You were screwed 
[01:05:00]  It wasn't a  Hi how are you doing  Kind of a thing  We'd like to welcome you  To the neighborhood  They were conquering you  And by conquer  That meant  Killing and enslaving  Your men  And raping and killing  Your women  That was pretty much it  But the Coliseum  Is a popular  Vacation spot  And all of these  Wonderful things  That we see  Historically built  We go to visit  Oh they're historic  You can't knock them down  The Romans were wonderful  They invented  The aqueducts  Whatever  Yeah  All this stuff  We credit them  Accurately for  So just because 
[01:05:30]  Some cultures sucked  Doesn't mean  They didn't do anything  Good technologically  Yeah  Some horrible  Cultures  And nations  And dictators  Under dictators  Have come up  With some  Pretty amazing stuff  Right  You have to  In order to get  That kind of power  I think  Like I understand  Mussolini was quite  The hat blocker  From what I hear  It was all about  The trains  Being kept on time  Too  Oh boy  Well the trains  Ran on time  Did they  Can we continue  Our google bit  On the OPN8 
[01:06:00]  Off show please  I didn't mean it  That way  That's always the  Thing they say  About Mussolini  Oh really  Well at least  He kept the trains  On time  Like that  Justifies everything else  As long as you  Can get from  Point A to point B  Hey um  The google search  The google  Uh  Girl on girl  Lesbians  Ooh  You know  The number one  Country searching that  Or the number one  Cities  Or city  Or whatever  I would have to say  It would have to be  Somewhere very  Um  Hip and metropolitan  Um

[01:16:30]  Oh no kidding  Like you think the military  Uh  Doesn't have  Better satellite pictures  That he could pull down  I was gonna say  We're all impressed  With Google Earth  And all that  And now we got  Google Earth side view  Where you could drive  By your own house  Which is freaking  Still creeping me out  Yeah  You haven't seen  That feature yet  I have not  No  Yeah there's certain areas  That if you go to  Google Earth  You could click on it  And then look around  As if you're standing  In the street  Turning around  In a circle  That close  You can see your car  Parked in the street  Your house 
[01:17:00]  On one of the fan sites  They did  What is it called  Side uh  There's a  There's a name for it  Uh  The  A street view  Or something like that  The street view  Google  Somebody on  One of the fan sites  They did that  With my brother's  Restaurant FH Riley's  Oh yeah  In the heart of  Huntington Village  400 New York Avenue  Oh jeez  You're in trouble  I know  Um  But they did that  And they have it  On one of the fan sites  It's  It's creepy  Yeah  Yeah it's uh  It's uh  Big brother watching  Ugh 
[01:17:30]  And we think  That's impressive  And we think like  Google Earth  Is impressive  Like you said  Can you imagine  What Bush has  Yeah  That they're not  Willing to give us  Yeah  They could probably  Watch you pick your nose  In your backyard  Live  If he's saying  The  The internets  Right  As if there's  You know  A bunch of them  The internets  I understand  We all have  Verbal flubs  But when you  Lead the free world  You should not  Pluralize internet  Internets  And you should  Really learn  How to say  Nuclear  That's a very 
[01:18:00]  Important word  Especially when  You're threatening  World War 3  If Iraq  Or Iran  Comes up with  A nuclear bomb  I'm sorry  They're showing  This guy  Struggling in the  KFC  With the shotgun guy  And they refused  To show the end  Of the clip  I hate  The media  Well they're just  Dumb  Because you know  People  People want to see  But people are  This is where  They're dumb  I don't even  I laugh at them  Now  That used to  Piss me off  But I laugh  At them now  Because Good Morning  America

[01:21:30]  Mike what's up  Hey how you doing  This is ONARadio?  Yeah  My main question was  Well back in the day  I used to listen to your radio  And I remember  Pulling over  People were pulling over  We were laughing so hard  Mike  You guys used to have  Yeah you guys used to have a CD  And I wondered  If that was still around  Oh Demented World?  Yeah is that the name of it?  Yeah  Yeah we got screwed  With that whole CD thing  No surprise  As happens with  You know your first CD  Hey you know what  You know what  I got an idea  With that Demented World CD 
[01:22:00]  We haven't seen a dime  Off that thing  In over a decade  I think we saw Money  The first month it was out  And then  Then the guy  Who put the thing out  I don't even remember  His name anymore  That Bozo  He freaking  He represented Bozo  By the way  Funny you say that  He got mad at us  Because we talked bad about him  Because he wasn't paying us anymore  Then he goes  Well now I'm not paying you  Yeah  Picture this if you will  A gentleman owes you money  For services rendered  He then doesn't pay you 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  So you go on the air  And say how this guy  Hasn't paid you  The money you are owed  He then calls you  And says  Since you bad mouthed me  About not paying you  Now I'm not gonna pay you  Now does he still make money  From this  I doubt it  I think he's out of business  He didn't  He wasn't the best businessman  No  He was a complete douche  Yes  Another douche  That we came across  In our careers  Another guy that's not a man 
[01:23:00]  By the way  I'm gonna keep with that theme today  Oh  Another one that's not a man  Yo  Um  Well  You know  I think we should take a cue  From Radiohead  What did Radiohead do recently  I think it was brilliant  On their part  They put their songs online  Their latest CD  Yeah  Their latest CD  For people to download  Right  And I guess asked  Hey  If you like it  You know  Buy it  Right  If you don't  Whatever  Well it wasn't even that  They're like  You decide how much  You wanna pay  Yeah  How much you wanna pay for 
[01:23:30]  For our material  Wow  It's brilliant marketing  Well  Alfalfa and Spanky  Came up with the  Pay as you exit  Strategy  Back in an old  Our gang episode  I believe it's similar  So you think  Radiohead is ripping off  Who who  The rascals  Ripping off  The little rascals  The little rascals  Well  What's the response been  I mean  Have people like  Paid for it  Or have they made no money  Yeah  Well some  Idiots  Not idiots  Whatever  Some people just  Downloaded it for free  But then other people  Paid a lot more 
[01:24:00]  So it kinda averaged out  I think they said it  I think they said it  Average out to  Eight dollars  A download  Or something like that  Which isn't bad  Cause they're not  Going through a record  No overhead like that  Well there's overhead  But not as big as  When a record company  Takes a bite out of your ass  No real middle man  And you're going  Right to the source  So it was really smart  And it's gonna be  A new trend in music  I think a lot of bands  Are gonna go and  Do the exact same thing  Cause you know  You do have your loyal fans  That understand the whole concept  And like man  I love this band  And I understand that  You know  For them to continue  They need to make  Some kind of money  So they're the ones 
[01:24:30]  Going alright  I'll throw 20  I'm doing well in my life  And I love Radiohead  I'll give them $20  For this album  And then of course  You got others  That are gonna take advantage  Take it for free  You'll always have  Those people in the world  This has to be  Scaring the crap  Out of record companies  Absolutely  They have to be  Scared out of their wits  Because this takes them  Completely out of the mix  And it's completely  Legitimate and legal  And now it's a great way  To distribute the music  Especially amongst  Their demo  Right  You know  Who are people 
[01:25:00]  That  Younger people  That own computers  Know how to  They're savvy  About downloading  And burning stuff  To disk  To take around  Or just put it  On your iPod  A lot of the iPods  Now have  They can go in your car  So  I mean  It takes the record company  Right out of the mix  The band is getting the money  I don't think it scares them anymore  They see this tidal wave  And they know it's over  I mean  Well then what are they gonna do  They don't just fold  They're gonna have to  It's not gonna happen tomorrow  They're gonna have to reinvent themselves  And figure something out 
[01:25:30]  But this is the way bands are going  They realize for the most part  They don't need the record companies anymore  No  Especially if they're kind of popular  They have a big website  They can do it all themselves  The reason to have a record company behind you  Was for distribution and publicity  The band knows how to make the music  They were there to distribute  But now that there's such a worldwide web  The internets  You don't need that anymore  You as just a regular person 
[01:26:00]  Have access to the entire world now  If you have something that people  Deem worthy of downloading  That's why YouTube videos  Things like that  That take off  That people want to see  All of a sudden  Overnight  People become celebrities  Whether it lasts  Or their 15 minutes of fame  Is five minutes  Is one thing  But they're out there  Everyone knows who they are  For that time  So if you get a band  That's well known  That has a website  People are downloading the music 
[01:26:30]  It's not like it's  Them selling CDs  Out of a trunk anymore  Right  You know  They're making a lot of money  And reaching a lot of people  And keeping all that paint  Without being raped  Exactly  The record companies  For years  Notoriously  Just raped bands  And you're not getting  Seven bucks a CD  If you're out to four dollars a CD  You're not getting that  From a record company  You don't know  I know we were small potatoes  In the whole business  But we were in the business  When we put out our CD  We truly were  Got a nice little taste  We actually made a few charts 
[01:27:00]  The CD was selling really well  Back in the day  Anthony and I received  When he decided to pay us  We split 75 cents a disc  There you go  Yep  Split it  There's some honesty for you  37 and a half cents each per disc  Per disc  And that's when he  That's when he was paying us  And after a few months  He decided not to pay us anymore  And what was the disc going for?  At the time  12 bucks  Probably  It was probably close to 12  Maybe a little less  33 cents we were getting each 
[01:27:30]  Yeah whatever  Whatever it was  37  And he got all the poster money  By the way  Because we used to watch him  Count the cash in the corner  When we were doing  12 hour freaking CD signings  Back in the day  E-Rock bought one for $16  At Sam Goody  There you go  Back in the olden days  Anyway  It went off a little  Steve you got some info on this  That will be exciting for the listeners  Or will this be like  Hey I like  Wow he blew it off  He just called an audible  Said eh 
[01:28:00]  I'm gonna run the ball  Are you sure  I'm gonna run the ball  Are you so  Nah he just  He just knows that  A lot of bands are doing this now  And following Radiohead's lead  And they're gonna do  The exact same thing  What about Foundry  Is Foundry gonna be released  This way  Who gives a crap  Exactly  Thank you  Because I want Pendulum  I want to download it  And actually have you pay me  To download it  Well we're gonna  We're gonna have to ask Tracy  If this is possible  Pendulum  Well we got the website  Onaradio.com  A lot of basics  For the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  And how about we just  Throw Demanded World up there  For people just to download  I don't want a dime for it  No  Even if you like it  No  I mean  Nothing  I said we're gonna follow  Radiohead's lead  But in our case  We just want to give this to you  For being a faithful listener  Of the show  Is it possible to just get it up there  For people just to download  Nice  Little zip file action  What do you think Steve  You could  There's also  There's also  You can put it up on iTunes  You can put it up on any number of services  You can put it up on iTunes  Yeah  Just put it up on iTunes  Yeah there's any number of places 
[01:29:00]  You can put it up as long as  Pop it right on the ride  You can do it  I want them to have it for free though  I don't need a dime off that thing anymore  It's real easy  Alright let's do that  I think Mike came up with a good idea  And you know what  I was thinking Ant  That thing is  That thing is 10 years old  Right around now  Wow  It's the 10th anniversary  Of Demanded World  And honestly  Most of the tracks still hold up  Most of them  There's a few I listen to  I'm like ooh  That was a bad edit  Yeah  And just you know  Time goes by  Oh we really didn't get the job done 
[01:29:30]  On that one  But for the most part  They're still really  Really really good  Maybe we can play one  Going in a break  I don't know which one  We're allowed to play anymore  We used to be able to play all of them  Back in the day  We would just let the CD loop on the air  And there was no complaints from the FCC  Now I see this thing  And it's all bleeped  And whatever  We gotta do  Iraq air checks  They're gonna kill us  Yeah let's do that  Come on  Gotta do that  Yeah let's do that  There was something else  Oh we have  The noose thing  Is in the news  In the news  Can we spend a couple minutes 
[01:30:00]  On the noose thing  Yeah please  Cause it's getting out of hand now  I think a lot of these instances  Where nooses are showing up  Are people that realize  Now it's kind of a trend thing  That's gonna attract media attention  And they do it  How many of these are actual hate crimes  I think the one at Columbia  Was used to intimidate  I think that  You know  Was one of those instances  Where it was being used 
[01:30:30]  To intimidate  And send a message  To somebody  Yeah  Of color  But these other circumstances  Where they're just showing up  And the cops are being called in  And they're taking it  And looking for the perpetrator  So they could charge them  With a hate crime  Is ridiculous  And now they're looking  They're now looking  To put a law  In action  That will keep  That'll make the noose  Something you can't display  Oh my god  If you display it 
[01:31:00]  You will be charged  With a crime  Yeah  How ridiculous is that  It's  It's  I  When is the pushback  It's not a definitive symbol  Of hate  The noose  Sorry  It's just not  It really isn't  Why not then  You know something  If anything should be outlawed  As a hate crime  And a symbol of hate crime  It should be the crucifix  How about you outlawed  The crucifix  As a hate crime symbol  That people were hung on 
[01:31:30]  To die  For their beliefs  Back in  Ye olde days  A lot of people think  Jesus was the only one  That's just how they killed people  How they killed people  And  How about  You just outlaw that  Make a law  That if you display  The crucifix  You should be  Put in jail  For a hate crime  Yeah  It's getting to the point  Where  We are really  Turning into a nation  Of kooks 
[01:32:00]  It's beyond now  Calling us  Who are wussies  And politically correct  Went out the window  Years ago  It's so  Far beyond that now  I don't even know  What to call it anymore  I just call it this  Mass hysteria  And a frenzy  That is being whipped up  A lot  A lot  The media is responsible  For a lot of it  Because they jump on it  They love putting that  On the news  If a noose shows up  Anywhere  The news is there  And they're talking  About racism  And how horrible this is 
[01:32:30]  And then they interview people  And out of a hundred people  They interview  They'll take one person  There could be a hundred people  That say  Nah you know  I don't see any problem with it  I don't think it's that bad  It's just probably kids  Or something  Or whatever  But they'll find that one person  And put them on the news  That talk about it  As a big hate crime symbol  And then people watch  And go  Wow everybody thinks  It's a hate crime symbol  No it's  It's creative editing  It's not  It's  A woman had to take down  Her Halloween display 
[01:33:00]  Yeah we had this story  The other day  Because she had a noose  With a body in it  Yeah  Which is not being used  To anything  It was just a Halloween display  Halloween display  But we're losing our minds  Well people are falling for it though  Instead of just going  No I'm not taking it down  No  But what was I going to say  Oh I got to pat myself on the back  I called this one by the way  You can do that  I blame the freaking media  You know because now  We're getting news sightings  Every day  Because people aren't dumb  This is the world we live in  Everyone wants their attention  And knows how to get attention 
[01:33:30]  Now out there  Yeah  All of a sudden  The news is telling you that  Wow this news  Is outraging a community  There's just a bunch  Of dopey kids out there  Going  Look we're going to be  On the news tomorrow  Watch what I do  Dude let's hang a noose somewhere  Watch what I do  Dude look it's our noose  Dude  Dude  And they don't even have  Any hate behind it  They're just trying to get  Some attention  For their little group of friends  The easiest way to get attention now  Is to put a noose somewhere  And the news will be there  Put some kind of a cryptic message over it 
[01:34:00]  Right  And really try to freak them out  Right  But the problem is  It sounds like a harmless prank  But then the cops are going to be  Looking for you  Right  And if you get caught  You're going to be charged with something  Yeah  And it's a good thing again  That gang symbols  Are not viewed as hate crimes  Yeah there you go  So if you're arrested for graffitiing gang symbol  Why is that not a hate symbol  When there's nothing that says  We will kill you for certain things  More than gang symbol  Oh yeah  When are they going to do that  Oh I forgot 
[01:34:30]  Right  It's not white people doing that  It's minorities doing it to other minorities  And I guess that's what's expected  Right  That's fine  Right white people  If  What if somebody tried to legislate  Against graffiti being  A gang sign graffiti going out  Well all the time  People try to legislate against graffiti  And they want those laws lessened  They want the penalties lessened for graffiti  But yeah it's mostly gang signs  You see graffiti  Yep  It's not people with their artwork  People are like  It's our art man  Not you 
[01:35:00]  We're talking about people that put gang signs up  And that's violent  It means stay out of here or you'll die  And it's a direct threat  To direct violence  Which is still going on today  Yeah  And I want to know  Were more black people hung  And I don't know what the number is  Or were more black people killed by gang violence  I would like to know  What has killed more people  Through hangings  Or gang violence  What are the stats  Yeah I mean  Maybe there's a way to find that out  Yeah  But there's been a lot of people killed  With gang violence  Right  But listen me 
[01:35:30]  I saw like an old lady  There you go  The gangs are bad  Gangs  You know what Oprah taught me yesterday  While I was in the gym  Oh Jesus  Thyroid  Huh  Oh yeah she's getting a little fat  She's got something going on with her  I don't know thyroid  Would she eat it  But they were doing a whole show  On black culture  I'm sorry  I didn't hear you  That's okay  Good  And I was lifting  I don't watch Oprah  But if it's on in the gym  You're gonna  The gym I was in yesterday  There was no one in there  Except that Oprah was on  And some dummy was on  You know  The treadmill  Trying to work off 
[01:36:00]  Of a few hundred  And they  What I learned yesterday  Is that 70%  Of black children  Born today  Are born  Without a father  70%  70%  70%  That's what I said  Isn't that a problem  Isn't that a problem  Why isn't Reverend Al  Like talking about that  The noose is the problem  But the noose is the problem  That's why I'm bringing it up  Because we always go for  Something real easy  And when someone like  That's an easy thing  To like be outraged about 
[01:36:30]  A dumb noose hanging somewhere  Yeah  And then you get  The politicians  That really don't want to work  They're just like you and I  They don't want to work  At their jobs  So they go after the easy stuff  Like we have to make sure  No nooses are displayed  Ever  Oh wow  Thank you  Thanks for helping out  The community  And then when someone  Like Bill Cosby  Gets on  And talks about that  And talks about how  It's horrible  And that should be addressed  People call him  Uncle Tom  And it's just  It's ridiculous  Why can't 
[01:37:00]  Some responsibility  Be taken  Why can't people  Like stupid  Reverend Al Sharpton  Address those issues  Right  Because you know what  It turns his constituency  Against him  Black people knew  Bill Cosby was right  By the way  Black people knew  He was right  When he was talking  About the way you talk  You can't be a doctor  Talking that crap  But the bottom line is  There's still  This really weird thing  Where they don't want  Dirty laundry aired  In front of white people  Like that publicly  Right  Everybody knew  You know  It's like black people  Knew OJ was guilty  They're not idiots 
[01:37:30]  They knew  But you just don't want  That said in front of  You know white people  We finally got the OJ  Right  Right guys  I think  We finally got him  Well I got the memo  We finally got the OJ  I got the memo  A few weeks before  It actually went down  The whitey memo  Yeah  That all white people get  Right  And they said that  We think we got a good idea  Finally  To get him  And it worked  And you know  All his boys are turning on him  It's not looking good for  The OJ  They  His co-conspirators  Are all turning 
[01:38:00]  And they are saying  That it was OJ's idea  Yeah  To bring the guns  Not only  And to rub him up a little bit  Yeah  And scare the hell out of him  OJ insisted there weren't  Any guns even there  And now they're saying  Not only were there guns there  But OJ is the one  That insisted the guns be brought  And there's two guys now  Backing up this story  That they copped police for  There you go  And they really have OJ  In a pickle this time  Did OJ have a gun  Uh  No  No  He wasn't even holding a gun  OJ didn't have the gun 
[01:38:30]  And they're giving the legal equivalent  Of it was his idea  Yeah  Oh yeah  It's gonna get interesting  Oh they could absolutely be lying  Yeah  But when you get into court  And it's OJ  Like Ope was saying in the office  You get a judge  That's just kinda like  Look  I don't even care  We gotta put this guy behind bars  For killing two people  Yeah  We finally got it figured out  Yeah  Whitey needs a victory  Hey uh  Gotta take a break here  Oh but Dan wants to say something

[01:44:00]  Including like  Instant feedback link  They even post the best  Instant feedbacks of the day  Which I think is cool  They do the show rundown  With Stephen S  They got CokeLogic animated videos  That they're popping up  The show rundown is really good  Because we'll refer to  Video clips and this and that  And websites  And all that info  Will be found on  ONARadio.com  Later in the day  Right  So you don't have to like  Quickly grab a pen or something  Just go to that website  And all the stuff we talk about  Will be up there  In some form or another  Okay  We were talking about  Google Earth

[01:45:00]  Called there  Iraq  Street  Streetviewhotties.com  Wow  This is a great idea  The hell  We checked it out  Really fast  There's not a lot  To look at yet  But the guy  Is on to something  Basically we were talking  About street view  On Google  Where you could like  See the street view  Of your house  Or a restaurant  Or whatever  It was just the overhead view  You'd get from Google  You zoom in  On an area  And you go  Hey there's my house  You know  You see the roof  For the house  Now you can click  On the street  And get a view  As if you're  Virtually standing 
[01:45:30]  In the street  And you could do it  Like a circle  And look around  This is an awesome website  It's called  Streetviewhotties.com  Basically a guy  Is just like  You know  Checking out  All the street views  And when he finds  A hottie  He caps it  And throws it up  On this website  And right now  I'm looking at  Two girls  In their bikinis  Sunbathing in a park  From street view  And that's something  As we were going  Through it  During the break  I saw a couple  Girls jogging  You know  Nothing like  No hardcore stuff 
[01:46:00]  But honestly  I think this stuff  Is hotter  In a lot of ways  With all the pictures  That are being taken  From the street view  There's got to be  An instance where  Maybe a window  Shade was open  Of course  And somebody's  Standing there  Nude  I think it's obvious  That this is  A relatively new website  I think in the coming  Weeks and months  This could be a really  Really good website  To check out  It's called  Streetviewhotties.com  And we'll have  That link up  Later on  Onaradio.com 
[01:46:30]  Okay  Alright  Larry Craig or  E-Rock  Let's go  What do you want  To do  E-Rock  E-Rock  E-Rock  It is E-Rocktober  Running out of  E-Rocktober  It's E-Rocktober  Yeah  And any opportunity  To just goof on  E-Rock  Is  Should be taken  Okay  He gave us a demo  This is his early  Radio days  From WGNX  What kind of music  Was WGNX  It was an 80s station  That turned 
[01:47:00]  Alternative Rock  Out of where  Out of where  Out of Vero Beach  Florida  Vero Beach  A lot of  Aeronautics schools  In Vero Beach  Yeah  E-Rock's like  A  E-Rock was like  A young Rick Dees  He worked at like  10 stations before  He was like  16 years old  Really  Yeah  Did you write  Like Disco Duck  He went from  Rick Dees  To Double Dees  A little known fact  Not counting  Syndicated markets  Obviously  But actual radio stations  We've sat in  And did our radio show  I think E-Rock's  Got his beat 
[01:47:30]  I think E-Rock  Has worked at  More radio stations  Than we have  Really  How many have you  Worked at  I've never figured it out  Why don't you say  Been at more radio stations  Because it worked at  Stolen  Oh look at this  He rolls his eyes  And then looks down  All disappointed  He's sad  How many do you think  10  Close to it  Close to 10  Wow  Alright  So  Were you the  What  Afternoon drive guy  At WGNX  No  Night time  Ah night time  You weren't full time 
[01:48:00]  Don't even like  No I was  You really were  It was  It was a full time  Schedule but  Part time pay  So five nights  A week  So it was like  College radio  Or something  Kinda  How many people  Do you think  Were listening  Jesus  A couple dozen  On a good night  Maybe there was  20 calls  20 calls  A night  See this isn't cool  By the way  Dave in Manhattan  Sorry  We have ADD  On this show  He writes  On street view  You can see guys  Coming out of strip clubs  Oh man 
[01:48:30]  Blowing up their spot  Why you blowing up our spot  What are the  What are the odds  That that's gonna like  Happen  When that big truck  With the camera  On the top  Is gonna drive by  When you're coming out  Of the  Coming out of the  Strip club  That's not done  By a truck  Is it  That's just  Yeah  I saw how it was done  A truck just drives around  A truck with this big camera  With multiple lenses on it  Drives around  And just  Shoots  Just shoots  Yeah  And that's legal  That's kinda like  1984-ish 
[01:49:00]  That's like George Orwell crap  Yeah it is  And I know that's been used  So much over the years  But this is kinda odd  I don't think there was  Ever  An inkling  When you thought about  The future years ago  That there would be  A place to go  On a computer  That's readily available  In your house  That you could just look  At any place  In the world  In detail  You know  Just from the globe  You look at the globe  The earth in space  And zoom in  To a point 
[01:49:30]  Where you see cities  And then houses  And then people  That's something  That was so  Out of the realm  Of possibility  And here it is  We're becoming  A planetary unit  Yeah  Listen to me  It won't happen  In any of our lifetimes  But we're all  Becoming one mentality  I'm not even saying  It's bad  But eventually  We will all know  Exactly what each other  Is doing  At all times  Look at how it is now  After a few years  Of technology  Picture 500 years  From now  When it's all cameras  And the technology  Is 500 years advanced  Yeah  We will all know 
[01:50:00]  What every other citizen  Is doing at all times  We're going to become  It's going to be  A planetary unit  As opposed to countries  And stuff like that  Yeah  It's very hard  To keep yourself  Private these days  Because of all the cameras  That are out there  Not just like  Street cam  But all just the  Webcams  Security cameras  And then whenever  You do anything  Whenever you're  Making a transaction  You're on camera  In stores  You're using  Your credit card  You go to the bank  There's all records  Of all that stuff 
[01:50:30]  Your easy pass  So like you're really  At this point  Jimmy  It's not far off  I don't think  You're going to have  To wait 500 years  Before we all  It's going fast  As individuals  Know what  Yeah  At this point  It's going really  Really fast  GPS on the cell phones  Parents are able  To now track their kids  Where years ago  You know that was  Something that was  Out of the question  Well the rest of me  I'm saying like  For transportation  Like all of a sudden  You know  Now you're in California  They think a thousand  Years from now  Technologically  I think that's what 
[01:51:00]  Dr. Kaku estimated  Oh Dr. Kaku  Did you have a conversation  With him in the elevator  That's where I got  The planetary  He was talking about  Levels of planetary development  Before you're ready  For space  Were you talking to him  Or you read this  I heard him on the radio  Oh okay  I'm part of his fan club  Now too  Because I live in  That same area  I wouldn't  And I thought the guy  Was a brilliant  What is he  He's a physicist  A theoretical physicist  I thought the guy  Was a brilliant  You know physicist  Until I saw him  In line  Getting his  You know  His low fat milk  Yeah  And I'm like 
[01:51:30]  He's just like me  He's just a man  I'm just a man  Like you  Like you  I thought he was  Like a super human  He didn't have to  Eat or drink or anything  He just had to  Think of stuff  But no  He has to wait in line  And get his dumb  Low fat milk  His 2%  Or 1%  Whatever the hell it was  Hey alright  E-Rock  E-Rock  W-N-G-X  Oh  G-N-X  G-N-X  G-N-X  With E-Rock  For E-Rocktober  How long ago  This would be  A little over  4 years ago  Alright here we go

[02:05:00]  Have a medical center there  It's so important  For all these babies  Well I think you're  Babies  What happened  I think we were disconnected  Is Jimmy  Excuse me  Operator  I think we've been disconnected  Where's Jimmy  Jimmy's probably taking  Some type of  A sabbatical  I think he's  In the latrine  But this Larry Craig stuff  We're going to play  Is made for him  Larry Craig  Jimmy  What a  What a  This guy should just 
[02:05:30]  Stay off of television  Yeah  Jimmy  I just want to make sure  He's alright in there  Jimmy  Knock  Is he in there  What  Is he even in there  Oh my god  You just did a Houdini  We thought you were in the bathroom  Oh no no no  And then he walked  B-Rock went to the bathroom door  With a microphone  And then he walked in from over there  No no  I went to  To grab a couple of the DVDs  But I had to use the  You know  Yeah  You know  You had to tap your foot  In the men's room  Big boy made a duty 
[02:06:00]  No  No big boy  Should though  Because big boy's  Stomach is going  You're percolating  Yeah  Like a rusty hinge  Alright here we go  Larry Craig  Yeah so Larry Craig  What the senator there  From Iowa  Idaho  Where is he from  I believe  One of the  Iowa  Like it matters  Iowa  Like anyone knew this guy  Before he decided  To go into a  Bathroom  At an airport  And try to  Get a little  I couldn't tell you  One thing about Larry Craig 
[02:06:30]  Before this whole controversy  Except what he likes  In his mouth  So he went on TV  He's been doing  A bunch of interviews  And well I know  He did Dateline  I think he  Maybe that was it  And he's trying  To explain himself  And he's just  Making himself  Just  Guiltier  He's burying himself  Burying himself  There you go  Here's Larry Craig  Talking about  Entering the bathroom  In the old airport  So I go to the bathroom  To use the bathroom  For bathroom sake  I walk by the stalls  I glance at them 
[02:07:00]  To see whether  They're full  I stand out  In front of a couple  Of them  Waiting  And I look  And I see  Some movement  Ah  One of them's opening up  I go in  Let me stop you  For a second  You looked in the stalls  You walked by  At a glance  To see if they were occupied  According to this officer  You looked  Into the stall  Through the crack  In the door  On several occasions  Close enough  Where he could see  The color of your eyes  Oh my god  The old peekaboo  Right now 
[02:07:30]  If I was Larry Craig  I would look at my watch  I remember that  I had something else to do  I gotta go  This is a cop's work  Oh isn't that great  And it is a cop's work  You know  This is a police officer  Who was in there  To sting guys  He knows the difference  Between a guy  We've all checked out  Bathrooms  When you look at the feet  Underneath  Yeah  To see if somebody  Is just  You know  You look at the feet  You see the pants  Around the ankles  You're like  They're gonna be a few minutes  We've all done  The under the stall check  You cannot  You don't need to get up  And press your eyes in  Did you also shimmy under 
[02:08:00]  With your head  And look  To make sure  It was a human being  And on the mannequin legs  Fruit  You know what I find hilarious  When I go into bathrooms now  The things they're doing  To make sure  You don't come across  One of these guys  Yeah  They are  There is now  Like cinder blocks  From the floor  To the ceiling  Oh yeah  They're kinda  Closing them up  Completely  It used to be  Like it was just  Wide open  No one knew  This crap was going on  Yeah  And then  They put up 
[02:08:30]  A little barrier  And now  It's just cement  From the floor  To the ceiling  A bunch of  Moe's can't peek at  Right  Where it's  Drill proof  Peeking through the door  The crack of the door  How great is that  Let's keep going  I'm running out of time  I can see the color  Of your eyes  That just didn't happen  I stood back  Several feet  Standing there  Waiting with my luggage  Yes I was looking  At the door  But I was also  Looking at the feet  Don't you hate 
[02:09:00]  This guy's guts  Standing there  With my luggage  Like that matters  A distraction  Distraction  Just add things  To the story  No just  It's more like  My luggage  Just a regular  Business man  Trying to get  Home to my family  That's right  Well he claims  He never tapped  His foot  Let's see what  This is about  You don't remember  At any time  Tapping your foot  I do not  In this way  I do not  In the interrogation  Tape you do talk  About is it possible  Your feet brushed 
[02:09:30]  Yes  And you said  Yes it is possible  It is possible  But I don't recall  That  And he kept  Leading me  Into this  And I kept  Saying no  He entashed me  There is no way  Anyone can lead you  Into some type  Of experience  In the bathroom  If you don't want to  And look  The stalls  Are not thin enough  Where you're  Going to just  By accident  Brush up against  Someone else's foot  In the next stall  Feet do not  Leave the confines  Of the stall 
[02:10:00]  Like when this  All hit  And he said  Stuff like this  We were  Talking on the show  Like how wide  Is your stance  When you're in  These stalls  Where that's  Going to happen  Every guy  Listening knows  That's impossible  Well women too  Because they're  In the stalls  Obviously  It's impossible  To by accident  Brush the foot  Of someone else  In the next stall  He's dumping  Like a sumo wrestler  Before they start  And here's what  A liar he is  Because he's saying  Well the guy  Is trying to  Entice me  And I kept  Saying no  If you're sitting  There in a regular  Bathroom stance 
[02:10:30]  When you're sitting  No way  Is a guy's foot  Going  The guy's foot  Would have to be  Eight nine inches  Under your stall  He's lying  And if that ever  Happened  If a guy's foot  Came out  I would put my  Feet so far  To the other side  And go  Excuse me  I wouldn't  What are you doing  I would take my  Heel and come down  Hard right on the  That would be  A good signal  And you'd get  Assaulting an officer  Not even know it  All right  Let's  Because unfortunately  We're running  On a show  We should have 
[02:11:00]  Started this earlier  Because this is  Radio gold  Just arc on it  Another radio crush  When someone says  Radio gold  Oh  I'll acknowledge it  Larry says he didn't  Touch feet with the  Officer  You know that there  You know that there  Have to be thousands  Of people who've  Heard this story  Now senator  Who are trying  To picture how  They're flashing  Back to every time  They've ever sat  In a bathroom  Stall  Oh I'm sure they are  And they're trying  To think can that  Happen  How close are you  Actually to the guy  Next to you  And this is that  Infamous wide stance  Which I think  What you actually said  Is I'm a wide guy  Is the actual quote 
[02:11:30]  You said  And they're thinking  It's not that easy  To touch the guy's foot  Next to you  And so  How could it have  Happened  Well as I  It didn't happen  But you just said  It did happen  It did or it might have  Right  It could have  It could have  He's just  Humna humna humna  Ed Naughton  Why would you go  On TV man  Just go  Without a real good story  He's arrogant  Because he wants  To continue 
[02:12:00]  This dummy  This dummy  Thinks he's going  To escape  And he's going  To use his  Clever debating skills  Yeah  To explain it  He's out of touch  With how onto him  People are  And you know  The officer seems like  You know  A stand up guy  And seems like  You know  He was just doing his job  Not one of these guys  Like gets off on  Like you know  Luring guys  That aren't into this  He's not trying  To railroad the guy  He's just a cop  On toilet duty  Well now he talks  About the hand gesture 
[02:12:30]  What was the hand gesture  About  Apparently I'm guessing  You reach under  It has to be  It's gotta be  Yeah  You probably reach under  And like a  Alright let's see  What he says  And what about his hand  The details are critical  The palm up gesture  Regarded as a coded message  For men seeking sex  Something attracted my attention  And I looked down  Something  And as I looked down  I saw a piece of  Toilet paper on the floor  And it happened to be  Under my heel  And I don't know  If you've seen it before  But I've seen it  He's going with 
[02:13:00]  That old gag  That toilet paper  On the shoe bit  Toilet paper  Was on the shoe  So he  He tried to get it off  Why would you use your hand  To take toilet paper  Off your shoe  Instead of scraping it  On the floor  Everyone knows  That if you're in that situation  You don't want to touch  Toilet paper  So you use the other foot  You take the toe  Of your other foot  And step on it  And then lift your heel up  And rub your  He's going with that excuse  You do not touch it  Why didn't he say  I had my iPod on  And I was listening  To Minnie the Moocher  And I was tapping my feet  And scatting with my hands wide 
[02:13:30]  Ah cha cha cha  That would have been  More believable  I don't know  If you've seen it before  But I've seen it  Somebody walk out of a booth  With a piece of toilet paper  Stuck to their foot  I reached down  To take it off my shoe  Or out from under my shoe  And my hand did go  Below the divider  At that moment in time  The divider  Wait  Below like  Divider level  Level  Or you can't tell  If your feet touch  But you're such a  Wide stance guy  So your legs are wide open  While you're on the bowl 
[02:14:00]  Pants on  Apparently these are stretchy pants  Which open really wide  Yeah  And you go to the bathroom  And you see the toilet paper  Under your shoe  So he's trying to entice you  Into sex  But meanwhile  You're going to reach down  And just take toilet paper  Off your shoe  While he's trying to entice you  Shut up  Shut up and admit  He had pretty face  And a great body  And you couldn't wait  He took a peek  In the crack  Of the stall  Liked what he saw  Went to the one  Next to it  And was trying  To get something going  This guy 
[02:14:30]  Is just full of it  Matt Lauer doing this  He's doing a pretty good job  Yes he is  He's good at everywhere  You would say to me  At no time  Did you ever use  Your left hand  And go anywhere  Near your foot  Or the stall divider  Matt I would have  Had to turn  Almost sideways  To reach clear  Across and around  And I absolutely  Did not do that  So again  The fact that  These motions  Seem to replicate  A well established  Sequence of signals  For soliciting anonymous sex 
[02:15:00]  It's a coincidence  And then what you're doing  Is you're calling  This is not just a regular citizen  This is a cop  Yep  Again they're not above lying  But it just doesn't make sense  That the cop  Right  With he showed the badge  Right  He wasn't like  Let me bust this senator  I think the last thing  This cop or any cop  That has this detail  The last thing  They want to do  Is that detail  You know what I mean  And I think  They're pretty savvy  On what the signals are  I bet you  You've got to be  You've probably become  Very savvy to that 
[02:15:30]  I think if you're  One of these cops  And you're on that detail  You're going to pretty much  It has to be so over the top  For them to get involved  Because they don't want  To deal with this crap  You know that's  What they have to do  That's the job  Every day  They've got to do  For a while  They don't want to  Actually do it  Unless there's  Some probably  Aggressive thing going on  Everything this jerk  Has said  Has been wrong  And a lie  The cop is not  Does not  Knows the difference  Between a guy  Going to the bathroom  And a guy cruising  Yeah  That's the  The cop knows 
[02:16:00]  Why are they not  Arresting people  All over the country  Accidentally  There you go  He's the first one  Accidentally  It's accidentally  That we know of right  Yeah there'd be people  All over the place  Outraged  I was  Oh yeah  We'd have to march  On Washington or something  Disgusting toilet paper  Off of my foot  In an airport bathroom  Yeah  With my fingers  Instead of my  My other shoe  They're killing us  They want us to wrap up  But we've got to  Squeeze this in  I now know  That this cop is  This officer 
[02:16:30]  Is a profiler  He said looking  Into a stall  Was one of it  And then a hand gesture  Or a foot tap  Is another one  Now I know all  About profiling  I know what people  Feel like when  They're profiled  He's sick  Wow  People get caught up  In what I was caught in  As an innocent person  It's very angering  At times  You know what  I hope this guy's  Life is ruined  Oh is he  Just  I hope this guy  Just rots  Profiling  Profiling  I now know 
[02:17:00]  What it's like  To sound like a sissy  And he won  I shouldn't have  A voice like this  Profiling  What a douche  You're gonna blame  The cop  For doing his job  I hope this guy  Rots  Yep  Somebody  People are already  Coming out  The final clip  Because we've got to  Get out of here  We could do so much  More on this  Unfortunately  We just  Ran out of time  Today  Seconds later  There was a card  Under the divider  Saying police  Step out  According to the police report  What the police officer  Heard you say  Was no 
[02:17:30]  Yes  Here's the part  I have problem with  Senator  If you had  If there had been  Nothing going on  In this stall  And you had done  Nothing intentionally  It seems to me  You would have been  Completely confused  As to why  Some guy next to you  Yeah  Is showing you  Police identification  Well I was  I didn't know  I didn't know  That it was  Real or not  Why'd you say no  I said no  He had a gesture  And I said no  And then another gesture  And I stepped up  Pulled my pants up  And stepped out 
[02:18:00]  You know what  You don't know  If it's  You wouldn't say  I'm trying to put myself  In the position  Where you're  Completely innocent  Something happens  And then a cop  Puts a card under there  Saying he's a cop  You don't go  No  Or no  You don't say no  You go  Excuse me  Why  What's that  Supposed to mean  Oh  What a tool  That's great  No I wasn't doing that  I thought the officer  Was deflated  I was just trying  To blow him back up  Because like a balloon  He was running out of air  What a loser 
[02:18:30]  Why can't we stay  Down here a few moments  Do they gotta get  To the music that fast  I guess we could have  Jimmy  I guess we could  Tomorrow we got  We can talk about that  A little more tomorrow  That's easy  This show is ongoing  All the time  We got tomorrow man  We got Steve Carell  Calling in apparently  We got Chaz Palminteri  In studio here  And Springer  And Jerry Springer  We got a busy show tomorrow  So if you're not joining us  Over at XM Satellite Radio  Have one of those good days 
[02:19:00]  Will ya  Bye  Yep  That should hold efforts  For a while  Mic's on  Oopsie  The virus  Is spreading  Opie and Anthony  And here we are  XM Satellite Radio  Ready to broadcast  To two countries  Man  That was uh  That was a short one today  Right  That was very fast  Oh 
[02:19:30]  You know what happened  Huh  We had production to do  Over at the other place  Oh that's why  That's why  I didn't  And it was still short  Jiminy Cricket  It just felt short  I say  I look at the clock  And it's about average  Anyway  We're just tired  I don't have time to send anything up  A little program note  Cause we're having people show up every day  To check out the XM broadcast  We're not gonna be here tomorrow  We're doing the Pat Cooper rose  So we got a short day tomorrow  We'll be on from 6 to 9  And then taking the rest of the day off  So just keep that in mind 
[02:20:00]  Yep  So you won't be able to check out the XM studio tomorrow  But we'll be open for business on Monday  Monday  Open for business  Well it's kind of  Like that  Like we're a little family drug store  I feel like I'm ready for the Pat Cooper roast  I mean I got like a bunch of shit man  Like six pages  Yeah I mean let's hope  Yeah  It's gotta be hard  I don't know how you do a roast  It's fun to do  But the problem is  With the Pat Cooper  This is the problem  I know Pat minimally  The other guys on the  I don't really know many of them 
[02:20:30]  Who else is roasting Pat Cooper?  It's weird  It's myself  Greg Fitzsimmons  Who there's not that much on  Who I know Greg  Gilbert Godfrey is roasting him  Artie Lang is one of the roasters  Robert Klein is one of the roasters  Stewie Stone  Dick Capri  Lisa Lampanelli will do very well as the host  She'll fucking kill  Oh she's hosting  Yeah Lisa's really good  So she'll  A lot of jokes about banging black guys  Oh she loves the black cock  She does too  She really does love black cock  At least she tells the truth about that 
[02:21:00]  Yeah  She loves a black dick  So there's a lot of guys  And the guys on the dais  Trump's on the dais  You know people will poke fun at him  But there's not a lot of people up there  David Dinkins maybe  Or Al Roker  There's some guys out there  You can throw jabs at  But it's not like  When we roast Voss  Or Patrice  It's all my friends  Or stupid  Colin  Colin's one of the roasters too  Colin I'm sure will be great  He always comes up with really  Insightful funny shit  But  There's not many friends of mine up there 
[02:21:30]  There's just Colin  And I guess  You know Artie Lang  But Trump is going to be there?  Yeah  I don't think he's roasting  But you know  People will comment on his hair  How many  Do you have a hair joke for Trump?  But not  It's not  It's not the normal one?  It's pubic right?  Or ass  Ass hair?  No  I would just talk about his hair  And then  Make it his pubic hair  Someone was suggesting  Why don't you guys  Broadcast the Pat Cooper roast  On 202  First of all  We tried  Did we? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  Logan called and said  We should freaking put this  On the channel  And of course you should  But it's a little more complicated  Than that  Why?  And we couldn't get it done  There are rights and things  There's so many people  Yeah there's so many people  You know  Celebrities  Some of the most obvious things  You just can't do anymore  I was thinking about that  The other day  I saw About a Son  It's a Kirk Kobe movie  That  I went for free  And this is the problem  We get tickets for stuff  To check out  Like we went and saw 
[02:22:30]  Bronx Tale  And Jimmy and I  And our girls  We love the damn thing  One man show there  Amazing  And Chaz is going to be in tomorrow  I have no problem  Talking about a Bronx Tale  But I saw  About a Son  About Kurt Cobain  I was completely disappointed  And then I felt like  Oh crap  I got the tickets for free  I guess I'm supposed to  Talk about it  But I would never  Like fake it  Fake it and make believe  I'd like someone I didn't  Yeah  But it puts me in a weird position  Because they look at you  Hoping you know  You're going to give us  Some nice exposure  And it's an interview 
[02:23:00]  That Kurt did  With some guy overseas  And they  I think it was for  The Vanity Fair article  That came out  Or no  To combat the Vanity Fair  That was the article  That said that  You know  Him and Courtney  Were doing heroin  While she was pregnant  And all these horrific  All these horrific charges  And then  Kurt decided to have  A really long interview  With this guy  I think overseas  Or somewhere  I don't know  But the guy taped  All his phone conversations  With Kurt Cobain  I know I'm long winded here  I'm sorry  And so the guy  Took all his tapes  Of him talking to Kurt  Over a few months 
[02:23:30]  Period  And edited it down  And made it into a movie  Oh they're not even  Videos of Kurt  No  It's called  About a Sun  It's in like  Small little artsy theaters  Went downtown  In the West Village  There  Check it out  And so it's  Kurt's voice  For about an hour  And a half  And some of the stuff  Is really interesting  What are they showing  When all this is being played  It's a movie  Just like  And you know  It was some L.A. douche  Like even the  The idea itself was good  But then some L.A. douche  Had to kind of ruin it  And like the shots 
[02:24:00]  Are like of Seattle man  But it's like  But kind of like  Artsy shots of Seattle  And very  What a bore fest  That sounds like  And like you know  You know  Kurt's talking about  Being in high school  And stuff  And it looks like  They show his actual  High school  Which I thought was cool  And now you know  A new kid  Just kind of  Walking the hallways  That they pretty much  Hint is the type of person  You know Kurt was  Back in the day  Yeah  And then when they  Talk about one of the  Places he worked at  They show  As he's talking about  They actually show  Video of that place  And I thought that idea  Was pretty good  But they didn't really 
[02:24:30]  Take it as far as  They could have  I think  I know I'm probably  Just talking to Nirvana  Fans right now  They're so stupid  But I guess the point  I'm making  Lazy documentary  But the point I'm making  So it's an hour and a half  Of Kurt's voice  Never see him  Never see a band member  None of that right  And it's just video  Of Seattle  And they show  How awful the place was  And they just show  A lot of  A lot of video  Of residents of  The towns he used to  Live in and stuff  And their facial features  It was just whatever  But what pissed me off  Was they couldn't  Throw one stupid  Nirvana song  Into the movie 
[02:25:00]  No  The rights I guess  That's  Yeah  It went a long way  To say that  Because you think  Some of the  Most obvious things  And easiest things  To do in this world  Especially like  When you're trying  To make a movie  Or do a radio show  Or a TV show  It's not as easy  As people think  You would just assume  They could just throw  A bunch of Nirvana  Songs in this movie  To kind of maybe  Bring it together  And they can't  Like the closest they came  They played David Bowie  The man that sold the world  Yeah  Because Nirvana  Redid that during Unplugged 
[02:25:30]  But it was the  David Bowie version  That was the best  They could do  Because Courtney  Obviously wasn't  Going to give this guy  Any songs  Even though  The director was  There at the theater  And had a little  Q&A after the thing  And he claimed  That he was pretty  Close with Courtney  I'm like  Not too close  Not close enough  Not close enough  To get a couple  Nirvana little  Diddies in your movie  Huh  At least a piece  Jesus  So it was interesting  If you're a Nirvana fan  I guess  But I was expecting  A lot better movie  I wouldn't be able  To sit through that  Yeah  Holy shit  Just clips of Seattle  And  Ugh 
[02:26:00]  Guy doing Seattle's best  On a park  Well  But like  When he talks about  Some of the shitholes  He lived in  They're showing shitholes  But I don't think  It was the actual shitholes  That he lived in  It's like  Well why didn't you  Show the shitholes  You showed shitholes  More shitholes  Well you showed shitholes  That  Are similar  But it was  It was kind of obvious  To me that it wasn't  The actual place  Yeah  And then he's talking  About growing up  It's like  Well show his  You're showing video  Of the area  Just show his  Childhood home  That would be 
[02:26:30]  Kind of interesting  With maybe even  A little graphic  To help the  You know  The people in the  Theater along  Like this is his  House that he grew up in  That's laziness  Because you don't know  No I  I swear  I walked out  Going  Some LA douche  With a vision  Wrecked this movie  And how to  Overthink it  Yep  How to overthink it  Because if it's just  Going to be voice  Over stuff  You need to really  Like have the  Visual aspect  Of any documentary  He's got to tie into  What the hell  They're talking about  So yeah 
[02:27:00]  Like you said  Show the house  Get  Get where he was  His experiences  You know  Things like that  Instead of just  Some stupid  Psychedelia  Of Seattle  Yeah  He's talking  You know  He's talking about  The house  On the lake  There in Seattle  Where he  Obviously ended up  Killing himself  Not even a hint  Of the house  It was just  Kind of more  Footage of the  Actual lake  It's just like  What are you doing  Just  Just do it 
[02:27:30]  I think what you're  Trying to do  Just do it  Who found Carter  Was he a repairman  Or some shit  Yeah  He was a repairman  Couldn't fix that  How did he know  His girlfriend  Or Courtney  Wouldn't find him  Huh  How did he know  Courtney wouldn't find him  Or he didn't  I think he didn't  I don't know  I think he didn't  Give a crap  He kind of hints  That blown his own  Head off in this movie  That he talks about it  What year did he do that  94  It was 94  Wow  Yeah  Oh he does hint about it  Yeah  I forget  What did he say  I'm gonna blow  My fucking head off  He was talking about  His stomach issues 
[02:28:00]  And that he can't  Take it  What's wrong  With his stomach  Stomach issues  Yeah he had bad stomach  That's why he said  He killed him  He had bad pain  Yeah  Wow  Yeah he just couldn't  Deal with his stomach crap  Did he talk to his doctor  About it  Huh  Did he talk to a doctor  About it  Yeah I guess  They couldn't really  Figure out  What to do for the guy  He had cramps  Maybe it didn't help  That he was  Swallowing heroin  In between meals  Yeah I see  Stuff like  It was probably  His drug problem  And all right  He probably  Lactose intolerant  And he loved ice pops  He would always  Break wind  Or throw him out 
[02:28:30]  There's a moment  Near the end of the movie  Where you know  He's in the middle  Of like talking  About whatever  And all of a sudden  You hear Cordy  In the background  Going Kurt  It's like the middle  Of the night  Kurt  When you come upstairs  Can you get a bottle  Out of the fridge  Like just a very  Like you know  Private moment  Between you know  Those two  And obviously  You know  Francis Bean  Right  Like you know  When you're done  With your interview  Can you come upstairs  With a bottle  I need one  And he's like  All right  I'll be right up  Which was kind of creepy  Kind of different  But then  Then I walk out  Of the theater  I'm like  Was that calculated 
[02:29:00]  Like were they  Were they trying  To make it  You know  Make it look like  They were regular people  Like everybody else  And to leave them alone  Eh whatever  Google's offering  30 million dollars  To anybody  Who can get  To the moon  Oh yeah  You haven't heard this  No  This is a  Oh this is  Wow we haven't  Talked about this  Is it an advertisement  They want like  Their Google advert  What do you got  To plant a Google flag  Can we find a story  I thought we did this  On the show  No there's a  This is a serious thing  It's like  It's open to anyone 
[02:29:30]  The first person  That could get  Their rocket ship  Or whatever  On the moon  Will win 30 million dollars  Yeah  Do you have to like  I don't know  It doesn't have to be  A person does it  That's insane  I don't know  If it's a person  Can you just crash  Something on the moon  Like a tin can  Help us out  Somebody knows this story  I think you  Get your rocket ship  On the moon  And then you have  To be able to like  Have some kind of  Rover craft  That moves around  The moon for a little bit  For a hundred yards  Or something  I don't know  That's pretty  Friggin  That's hard 
[02:30:00]  Huh  That's pretty hard  To do  It's called  The race  Yeah can you find  That article  It's brilliant  Because they had  The first civilian  That actually got  Into space  And it was the  Virgin Atlantic  Spacecraft  That made it up  Into space  I think it was  65 miles  They had to reach  And they won  A big cash prize  That was put up  But now Google's  Offering 30 million  To get to the moon  Is NASA eligible?  Yeah right  NASA does it 
[02:30:30]  Watch Neil Armstrong  Try to go back  And collect retroactively  Oh bastards  Never paid me  By the way  Ralphie May's  Gonna get a beating  Today when he calls in  What happened?  Yo Hope  Your boy Ralphie May  Was just on  Preston and Steve  Like 20 minutes ago  Oh yeah?  For the most part  We don't tell people  Where to go  But that's a biggie man  What is he doing?  He might not know  Admin in here now  I'm just doing phone  Or a publicist  May just go  We got these guys 
[02:31:00]  In Philly  These guys in New York  These guys  Like he  Honestly  Because I've done those  We'll ask him  I wouldn't like  Go after him  But  Yeah I think  That honestly  You don't know  We do have a policy  You know  The guys should do  Whatever the hell  They want  But that's a biggie  Right now  That's a big one  Look at those  Fucking assholes  Fucking hate them  Stupid Philly  I'm obsessed with Philly  And why they're  Listening to that crap  And don't go  Because their show  Is better  I know damn well  Their show isn't better  I don't know what it is  I know with my soul  That their show 
[02:31:30]  Isn't better  It's a show  That people feel  They could put on  In a grocery store  Or a stationery  Is that it?  Look there are times  You know  We get into some  Battles  And we know  The other guy  Is right and we're wrong  We're so right about this  We know their show  Just sucks  But fuck  They're listening to it  For whatever reason  Hey we got the story  We're still looking for it  Yeah  Hold on  And then we have  Tech Talk  With Jim Norton  Coming up  Oh  What do you mean Jimmy?  Well  Tech Talk  In other words 
[02:32:00]  Jimmy needs some information  Oh Anthony  That would just be  Self-centered of me  Self-centered  Self-serving  It's a show  That I'm working on  Where  It's about  Jimmy can I hold you  Hold you there  Because I don't want  I don't want to  Mess you up here  We found the story  Just to get that  Out of the way  Alright  That's fair  Because I don't want  To like you know  Blow through  What you're about  To say here  Google on Thursday  Announced  Thursday  They were talking  About this a while ago  September  Oh this is from September  Really  September  It's from September 
[02:32:30]  Okay  Google on Thursday  Which means in September  Announced it has  Sponsored the Google  Lunar X Prize  A robotic race to the moon  With a purse of  30 million dollars  Purse  The contest invites  Private teams from  Around the world  To build the robotic  Okay it is about  A rover  Yeah  Capable of roaming  The lunar surface  For at least 500 meters  And then sending  Video  Sending back  Video  Images and data  Back to Earth  Among other feats  The idea behind  The challenge  Is to urge  Private industry  To develop 
[02:33:00]  New robotic  And virtual  It's hard to read  This screen from here  Robotic and  Virtual presence  Technology  To reduce the cost  Of space  Exploration  That is a  Fucking cool contest  But how much  Would it cost you  To get there  I mean 30 million  Is a lot  But wouldn't it cost you  A lot to get there  Exactly  I think that  When a Virgin Atlantic  Guy  They're  Branson  Yeah yeah  I just call him  Virgin Atlantic  Guy  Richard Branson  Sir Richard Branson  I believe when  His spacecraft 
[02:33:30]  Reached the 65 mile mark  And collected that  Prize money  They had spent  Way more  Than the prize money  I think it's more  Bragging rights though  For these guys  Yeah  And for these  Private industries  They laugh at that  They're like  Alright 30 million  It'll help some  Of the cost  I don't think  They're doing it  To actually win  30 million  I bet you need  A Google logo  On your  Your spacecraft  Too or your rover  Right  Because then  It's the first  Advertising  That would be  Placed on the moon  I know it's cool  Google  It basically said 
[02:34:00]  In September  And go  So it's happening  Right now  People are  Trying to figure  It out  Design it  Everyone from  Just like  Some dope  That thinks he  Could do it  In his garage  To big corporations  It's amazing how  The first advertising  In space  What  What morons  We are  As a species  Is going to be  The word  Google  Google  It's a fucking  Baby sound  Google  It would be great  If Google  Was some alien 
[02:34:30]  Word for  War  Yeah  Like  It's the worst  Word you could  Say to an alien  Race  And they look  At it and go  They fucking  Call us Google  Google  Oh man  Even better  They think they're  Like communicating  With us  And they've just  Been waiting  For our answer  And we finally  Put it around  The moon  Google  Our answer  Is Google  Google  Wow  Okay  Destroy the planet  Alright  We were gonna  Give them a pass  But they said  Google  We were gonna  Cure all your  Diseases  And cure famine  And everything else  But fuck it 
[02:35:00]  Now just blow  The whole planet up  Says it right there  Next to that dumb flag  Google  Google us  No  Google you  Motherfucker  We're done  Or Google  Is actually  The way that  Species says  I dare you  To come  To come  And fuck  My mouth  Aliens  Just shoving  Their whatever  Alien penis  In everyone's  Mouth  You told us  You wanted us  To google you  Wait wait  The big president  Steve bit  Is that they  Read off  Fark  Dot com  That's wonderful 
[02:35:30]  That's real tough  To do  By the way  Reverend Al  Yes  Reverend Al  Nice name  From North Carolina  He's lingering  Longer  He writes  Start building  Your rockets  Contest pigs  Did I win  Did I get  To the moon  Did you make  Anything  No I'm not  Sure how the  Did I make  It to the moon  Though  You know  Soccer moms  All over the  Country are like  Building their  Dumb rockets  They're going up  Only two feet  Three feet  Crashing back  Down  It's a funny 
[02:36:00]  Instant feedback  From mobile device  Alice Cramden  Wins google moon  Race  Extra  Extra  Extra  Extra  Oh that's a  Good one  Yeah  That might be  Line of the day  Right there  Instant feedback  Or you never  Know  So there you go  That's what we  Know on the  Rocket rover  Thing with google  30 million  Up for grabs  We should  We should take  That concept  That idea  And do something  With the show  Like what  Well they're saying  A google  Obviously there's 
[02:36:30]  Some kind of  Google logo  Involved  Maybe there's  A wow logo  Involved  The first person  That could do  What with what  Wins what  First person  To get a wow logo  On the moon  Wins fifty dollars  Wow  Fifty dollar  Roonies  That's right  Fifty clams  That'd be great  You're actually  Able to build a  Craft to go to  The moon  And you don't  Realize there's  A google contest  And you just  Win fifty bucks  From us  Yeah  Can we get  Some prize money  Can we get  Maybe  The first one  To get a wow  Sticker  On the  Presidential  Helicopter  Window  How about

[02:38:30]  I liked Ron and Fez  When they used to  Do the internet  Thing back in the day  Ronandfez.com  That's right  I couldn't remember  The name of the show  I'm an idiot  But when they  Start talking about  Lost  I gotta  Change the station  Because I don't  Want to know  That's a show  That you do not  Want to know  What the fuck  Happens in the next  Episode  So if they  Want to do that  Do as much  Lost talk as you  Want  That's right  Not kidding me  As a listener  By gum  Thank you  Very much Fez  And Ron  For spoiling  Everything  Hey  Spoilers 
[02:39:00]  Hey Steve  I gotta apologize  To you  You gotta work  Today  I'm sorry  I'm ready  Is that a  Friggin insult  Sorry you gotta  Work today  He's calling you  A lazy bag of shit  He's right  You gotta check  With Tracy  We want  Demented World  Available on  ONA  Radio  What is it called  ONA Radio  I got it written  Down  ONA Radio  We want that up  There  Nice quality  For people to  Download and get  A little piece  Of the action  It's in the old  Notebookie  Alright and then 
[02:39:30]  Number two  We gotta get  With Don Wicklin  Who  Yeah exactly  Sorry Don  What is Don  Doing right now  Ant  He's either  Scrubbing out  A toilet bowl  Or he's got  A big long  Stick in the yard  Out there in  Washington  With a point  On it  And a bag  And he picks  Up the  Crushed cups  And various papers  And things  And puts it  In the bag  No do you know  What he does  He's in charge  Of ratting  He gets the rat  Side of the  XM  Fucker  Ratting  Well here's how  He does it  I was gonna say  He's gonna be  On rat control  Rat detail 
[02:40:00]  Here's how he does it  Okay  Wicklin is notorious  For his gigantor logs  So what he does  Is they drill a hole  In the studio floor  And he kind of  Half hangs a gigantor log  Out of his cheeks  And the rats cling to it  Like flies to fly paper  Ah  And then he stands up  And he scoots over  With his feet  And he drops the rats  In a bucket  Drops it in a bucket  See you heard  Half the story  Oh no  He is a ratter  They call him a ratter  Cause he gets rats  Around there  But what he does 
[02:40:30]  Is he shoves  A cardboard  Paper towel tube  Up his ass  And then the rats  Go up the tube  Into his asshole  And he holds them  In his ass  And actually  He's got a record  He tries to set  A little personal  Contest he does  It himself  And tries to  See how many rats  He can get up his ass  Before he's gotta  Go outside  And dump them  And I think  His best so far  Has been  Like eight  I guess eight rats  Eight rats  Eight rats  He's had up his ass 
[02:41:00]  Armageddon  That's that old story  With the gerbil  Yes the gerbil  Yes  That was the code word  Oh that was the code word  Yeah  In hindsight  Lighting the match  Was a bad idea  We all know  Yes  And it's called Armageddon  You know  And then  Have we played  And then Elo  Had a broken nose  Yeah  Cause he lit the match  To get the last rat out  And the gas  Exploded in  His ass  Speaking of the rat  Thing that everyone knows 
[02:41:30]  Is just bullshit  There was  Like a professional newsman  That read the story  Can we find that audio  I don't think we've played that  In a while  Real at first  Like when it first broke  A news guy thought it was real  You remember  Yeah we used to play it  Back in the day  Yeah that's like  One of those internet  I think that's where  A lot of people heard it  For the first time  Can we find it  Yeah definitely  People thought everything  Was real back then  On the internets  They would hear it  Like Steve  It is real  It is real  They'd hear a story  Like that  And you want to  You know what it is  You want to believe  Some of these stories 
[02:42:00]  You want to be able  To tell your friends  Dude  Listen to this story  Something happened  Cause people are like  They want to tell  These outrageous stories  So you kind of  Want to believe it  Right  And the guy  Didn't shove  A gerbil up his ass  His friend  Didn't try to light a match  To find the gerbil  And the methane gas  Didn't launch the gerbil  Into  His gay friend's face  Right  Like a cannonball  Well this is a great newsman  With the voice and everything  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Was a bad idea 
[02:42:30]  Right  Oh and Steve  The other thing  See he just laughed already  The other thing is  We got to get with  Will Chapman  Don Wicklin  C.C. Eric Logan  And Christopher Knight  And Christopher Knight  Sure  Peter Brady  Yeah  And we want to do a contest  With a WoW sticker  Possibly  In honor of this  Rocket thing  The rocket thing  Maybe the best display  Of a WoW sticker  Between now

[02:49:00]  Down here  Do your lines  And I'm like  I'm excited  I'm like wow  Laszlo  Laszlo just sees  The talent  That's in me  The opster  Right  Right  And last game  I was yelling  Marine guy  Yelling police guy  It's key  That you remember  That okay  So I go down there  And Laszlo's  Just showing me  All the stuff  You did  Using all your  Talents and voices  And singing abilities  And this and that  Half the time  You don't even know  It's Anthony  It's like holy shit  This guy's fucking talent  I'm like ah  That's really cool 
[02:49:30]  Alright what do you  Got for me  Can I say this  Yeah I can say  Fuck him  Fuck him in the mouth  Like Jimmy said  Oh my god  I don't mean that  It's Laszlo dude  I don't know  But the reason is  Because he has  Kind of longish hair  And he has like  Very soft smooth hair  To hold on to  While you're mouth  Laszlo likes that  He's fine  He's not gay  He's a good  This is my payback  Laszlo's a good friend  Of course he is  And of this program  I've spent time  With Laszlo  What better buddy  Than to take a mouth  Fuck him  That's the sign 
[02:50:00]  Of friendship  You never fucked  A good friend  In the mouth  Absolutely  And say not  My buddies  Doze off  On the couch  Their mouths open  I straddle  And I give them  A good throat fuck  And they wake up  And they go  Alright  I don't think of  Laszlo that way  And this is the payback  Because I left his  Studio thinking  I'm a one trick  Fucking pony  Oh no  Oh what were you then  Wow he found  Another character for me  I don't know how he did it  But another  Yelling guy character  You fucking douche  I get it  You're a yelling guy again 
[02:50:30]  I get it  I have no talent  But you want me in the game  So I can help  Fucking rock star  I've had it  Oh look at Anthony  Look what he did  He made up this whole  Jingle thing  It's unbelievable  It is unbelievable  Laszlo  And then he did this  Over here  And this and this  It's like four or five  Different things  That you don't even know  You think it's four or five  Different people  Alright what do you got  For me Laszlo  Shows me the script  I'm a gang member  That yells a lot  For an Irish fucking gang  And I go  Laszlo problem  I don't do accents  Goes out  We don't need one  So I'm an Irish gang member 
[02:51:00]  Yelling and screaming  But there's not a hint  That I'm Irish  Oh no  Maybe it's Irish  Maybe it's Irish  In the sense of the Westies  Or an American gang  Holy shit  There you go  Maybe  And then I finally realized  It took a really long time  I know  That I'm a one trick  Fucking pony with this guy  I'm a yelling guy  You're a yelling guy  In every game  Well you need a yelling guy  I was  And the funny thing is  Like the last game  He's like  I need you to be like  A marine sergeant  You know  Yelling at the character  I'm like alright cool  I did 
[02:51:30]  He goes hey  That's really good  I'm like thanks  Oh I got another character for you  I'm like really  I want you to be a police officer  I'm like alright  How do you want me to play this Laszlo  Because he directs you a little bit  You've been there  Yeah  He goes I just do the same voice  As marine guy  I'm like what  So I was two characters  With the same voice  I have the solution  If anybody wants to hear it  But how that this can change for you  Oh yes  I don't like it  I think that what happens  Is you and Anthony  I think both  Even though Anthony does voices  Both get pegged as just radio guys  And I think what you should do 
[02:52:00]  To show people like Laszlo  And other people out there  Don't know  Is that you guys should do  An acting scene together  Oh  I think that you guys  Should honestly  Pick a scene  Oh yeah good  A two person scene  And act it out  Acting  On the air yes  I'd be very  Very hard  I'd be very shy  Well it's okay  I'm shy too  We're all shy  It's very hard to act  In front of people  Well you wouldn't have to  You wouldn't necessarily  Have to do it  It would just be us  And you would do it on the air  Obviously  Yeah well I can  I can show you my acting chops 
[02:52:30]  Acting chops  I think so  Acting prowess  Just in case you think  I was bullshitting  Here is the great me  Opie  This is from the last game  As a staff sergeant  Will this work today?  I don't know  Yeah who knows  Why fix it?  Who gives a shit right?  Mergers going through  More important  Staff sergeant  You brought a whore  Onto the base?  Have you no shame boy?  Are you a moron?  Is that it?  Sounds better in the game  When you're playing  Well you know  Music's playing and stuff 
[02:53:00]  Yeah  When you see the character  So that's me as a sergeant  And wow  I mean  I mean  Close your eyes folks  Close your eyes  So you can really  Appreciate the acting  Ability that I have  Now here's me  As a cop  In the same game  Oh  Yeah  Wow  You did it as a mime  Wow  That's a quiet cop  These email suspects  These CD players  Are the stupidest  CD players 
[02:53:30]  I've ever seen  In a radio station  They're so dumb  They really are  They are so stupid  To play it off the board  You have to like  Push three or four  Different buttons  Back there  To be  That's real convenient  It's so dumb  Have remote access  From the board  But you have to  Actually push buttons  On the unit  People understands  Finding a track  You find a track  You push play right?  Yeah  Not here in this studio  You find the track  Then you have to push  Stop, pause, play, skip  Skip back  And then it plays  Or something like that  All they talk about  Is the equipment  It's just dumb though 
[02:54:00]  And they're not  Fixing it for some reason  Yeah  It's not  Nothing's happening now  Oh no  You sure the track  Is recorded right?  Yeah  We've played this  Many times on the air  We haven't played in a while  But  Maybe Dead Battery  Don't be so sure Ralph  I ain't got no hairpin  Opie you're pulling off  Whiny Bitch now  Luckily tape is rolling  For your audition  I'm not whining  What?  This is called  For the game  This is called  A bit and a joke 
[02:54:30]  You idiot  That was kind of funny though  That he brought it  Into the bit  Wait what are you guys  Instead of yelling guy  He goes  You're pulling off  What are you guys  Into your acting scene?  I would like to hear it  You would like to hear it  I'd love to  You know something  I've seen you act  But I've seen it on  Television and stuff like that  In front of a camera  I don't know if I could  Just act like that  There are stage actors  And there are film actors  I believe I'm more  Of a film actor  Have you seen me 
[02:55:00]  Play to a camera?  You're amazing  I do it at home  All the time  You make love to the camera  You really do  You make love to it  You're like  You're like  You're like Coco  In Fame  Yes  Take your top off Anthony  Now suck your thumb  Like a little girl  Ew  Ew  But funny  Not that you need  My approval  But alright  See there goes the bit  Another bit ruined  Down the drain  As they say  Down the drain  That's always good 
[02:55:30]  When you have to like  Wipe CDs off on your chest  And hope that they're  Going to work  They say angry is easy  To act  Of course it is  Like angry is a lot easier  Because you can just  Be mad and yell  There's a safety in anger  That's the point I'm getting at  I'm angry  Oh here we go  You're angry guy  In these  And you're saying  That that's because  Laszlo isn't confident  In your acting chops  Laszlo basically thinks  That I'm useless  Just angry guy  Let's get a scene  Can somebody on our staff  Find a good scene  Not a long one  You guys should do 
[02:56:00]  I think that's a great idea  Do a scene  Alright  And anger is easy to play  I'll tell you what's hard to play  Yeah  Is um  We gotta start over though  This is what's hard to play  I would think romance  Romance with a touch of whimsy  A touch of whimsy  Romance with a touch of whimsy  How do you play whimsy?  Exactly  Whimsy  It's tough to play off  Romance with a touch of whimsy  I was just trying to think  Of a good movie  That would  Have you ever done 
[02:56:30]  A role Jimmy  Where you had to play  A romance  With or without the whimsy  The full topping of whimsy  No  Have you ever had to be like  Sensitive in any roles  You've done  Only one scene with Lucy  Yeah  Yeah  And Lucky Louie  That was it  Yeah but  That wasn't like a romance thing  Yeah yeah  That wasn't like  It would have been in a year  But  She was adorable  No I haven't  But romance with a touch of whimsy  Whimsy  You know what else is really a tough one 
[02:57:00]  It's a tough conflict  Is lackadaisically aggressive  I play lackadaisically aggressive  Very well people tell me  But then again I don't ask  See  Oh  Hey can we play this from another studio maybe  I'll try  Why set up something for ten minutes  And then not give the people  You know the payoff  The payoff  Yes  Well romance with a touch of whimsy  It's funny you ask him  Because as the project I'm working on now  I've been writing several films  Really 
[02:57:30]  It's not the be all end all for me  I'm writing some films  Several films  Yes  One's a romantic comedy  Uh huh  About an abortion doctor  Who uh  Who falls in love  With a woman who he gives  Eleven abortions to  Wow  Yeah  What a  Why would you let out that  Because now somebody can take it  And run with it  No they can't  I've copywritten it  Oh okay  I stole it from a man in England  He wrote the same movie  But in his movie the chick had ten  So I said let's add one  And make it ours  I got Don Wicklund on the phone  Oh 
[02:58:00]  Don  Good evening  Don  Why is there an echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  Echo  He's got his cheese dipped in  It was his cheese  He's got his cheese dipped in what  They own it two Jews  What  Way to fucking rush to the punchline  Fat chin  Holy shit  I was gonna say he's got his dick dipped  In warm cheese  And he's lowering it  But why would I say a punchline  That A  Wasn't particularly funny  And B  I blew by fucking announcing it 
[02:58:30]  Don  Jeez  Don get out of Eric Logan's asshole  And answer your phone please  Call us back  On the air  Good day sir  Good day  Now what  Well we can't do that  Alright we'll take a quick break  But that was  The point really is lost now unfortunately  A rare moment where I throw myself under the bus  And you guys don't get the payoff  Now we don't get the payoff  Oh well  I guess I'll just have to still be great in your eyes 
[02:59:00]  Well  Alright  Coming back  Oh we gotta do the tech thing  Oh my goodness  We won't forget  Alright we won't forget  Quick break  Tech talk  And we'll figure out  Jim Norton  We'll figure out all this  All this stuff  In just a bit  Horseshit  Hey kids  Why spend Saturday  Watching boring cartoons  About fighting aliens  When you can help fight  Real illegal aliens  Head to some real life  Saturday safety fun

[03:00:00]  What do we do first  We pick it up  Second  Check is loaded  Right  Cause we don't want any nasty accidents  So look down the barrel  And  Pull the trigger  Ah  Yep it's loaded Henry  And you made a mess  Next  Carefully file off the serial number  And conceal it quickly about your person  Yeah  Ammunation and Derek the Dodo  Have been proudly bringing gun safety to your community  For over 30 years 
[03:00:30]  Ammunation  Protecting your kids rights  Ammunation  Hey this is Laszlo  From the Technophile  And Grand Theft Auto  Rolling with my boys Opie and Anthony  I can't believe you're recording all this  You can't use any of that that we just said  John fucking Travolta  Da da da da da  Da da da da da da  Alright  Remember 
[03:01:00]  Remember  Remember a few minutes ago  We did that whole set up to a pretty good bit  Do you remember  And then it kind of just  Fizzled out and turned into flat soda  Try to remember all that energy in the build up  Yeah  It was quite terrific  We were talking about fucking Laszlo and his fuckholes  And  Well  I don't think that was  And this is payback  The big part of it  Because I realized that Laszlo  Realizes that I'm a one trick pony 
[03:01:30]  Went in to do some more voices for the latest Grand Theft game  And he's showing me Anthony's work  Does animation for Anthony's work in the game  And then fucking jingles and voices  It's  It's quite  It's quite impressive  And then it was my turn  And I  I had  I had to be a Irish gang member  Yelling a lot  Even though I  I don't speak  Any dialects  Yeah it wasn't  Or accents or whatever  Yeah  It was just me yelling again  And I guess he's gonna trip people into thinking 
[03:02:00]  It's an Irish gang member  By  By the animation of the character  Yeah maybe it's like an Irish gang member  That  Has been here a while  Right  Second generation  Yeah second generation  Huh  You don't do accents  Maybe a little bit  But on the spot probably not  Try an Irish one  I do accents all the time  Oh do you  Why don't you get out of here with your blarney stone  Hey that's pretty good  Why would someone be with a blarney stone  Exactly that's why you told me to get out of here 
[03:02:30]  Do a shillelagh  What  Something with a shillelagh  The shillelagh  Why don't you return me shillelagh  I don't know why every Irish guy  Is bellowing in that voice  He's just yelling  You're yelling Irish guy  I'm yelling Mick  I'm yelling Mick  Here's Laszlo  Laszlo  Do you remember the non-disclosure you signed?  Yeah exactly  Was it a non-disclosure?  Yeah it says that until the game  Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out in March 
[03:03:00]  You're not supposed to talk about your character  Oh good  Are you going to sue me now?  No  You're not going to sue me for  No not me  Dude I left your studio going  Wow he truly believes I'm just a one trick pony  I'm yelling guy  You just put different names on the character  But it's really  When it comes down to it  I'm yelling guy  Alright wait  Stay on the phone  So here's me as the staff sergeant in the last game  Last game yeah  You brought a whore onto the base?  Have you no shame boy? 
[03:03:30]  Are you a moron?  Is that it?  Okay  That's a perfect staff sergeant  Yeah  Yeah  And then you go  I got another character for you  I want you to be a cop  I'm like alright cool  How do you want me to do the cop?  I do it just like the staff sergeant  So it's twinkle toed maggot  Right  I'm going to look black in the game  I know it  Twinkle toed maggot  Same fucking voice Laszlo  You do have a bit of a Steve C thing going on there 
[03:04:00]  I get it  I get it  You like when I yell  You're running out of characters though for me  Yeah your Irish brogue was kind of shit  Dude I asked you  You said no  I don't need that  Just do your regular voice  They'll just have to like use their imagination that they're looking at an Irish fucking gang member  Imagination  Well and honestly how many Irish gang members are there in New York proper that walk around with Irish brogues?  Yeah with that derby on and a cigar coming out of their mouth 
[03:04:30]  Hey I'll teach them  Here's another line as me as a cop that sounds a lot like me as the sergeant that sounds a lot like me as the Irish gang member  I'm a black ninja mother  Oh  Oh hey  It's beeped for XM  What?  Wow  Dude that proves it  They're censoring the Opie and Anthony show  I pay for uncensored radio  At 10-11 they proved my point  I have to say Opie pulled the I'm a black ninja motherfucker line for the next game as well so 
[03:05:00]  Oh  Yeah and I don't even have to change my lines from game to game  Right  Now the fucking  Same line and voice  Now the fucking Irish gang member says I'm a black ninja  That's wonderful  You're fucking Gary Coleman  What you talking about Willis?  Yeah  No he sounds a little bit  I'm a black ninja but he sounded like a leprechaun  And then you rub  I'm a black ninja  Then you rub it in  And I'll keep it vague obviously  Then you rub it in and show me all this unbelievable stuff Anthony did 
[03:05:30]  And like thanks dude I get it  I suck  Thank you sir  I'll go home now  Anthony came by for multiple sessions  Oh shit he did  I saw  I like it  I might have to make that my career after this completely blows up  And then Jimmy shows up in sunglasses with that bluetooth headset on  He looks so Hollywood when he shows up  Yeah  Oh man  He's too cool for you  Jimmy Hollywood  You're looking to have me yo  You talking  This is  Listen to me kiddo  This is  This is Jimmy Norton  From Tech Talk with Jim Norton

[03:06:30]  It's gotta sound like you're sliding in  How about somebody moves this rug  Cause uh  Yeah we gotta get it right  Because they gotta  They gotta visualize out there Jimmy  They gotta feel like  That you are sliding in  What does that have to do with Tech Talk though  You're sliding in  Everybody understands  It doesn't make sense  If you came in on some kind of  Uh  High tech chair that rolled itself  That would be one thing  Don't be jealous  Because I  I came up with this sliding in thing  I heard that they're supposedly  Gonna be doing like a 30 minute Tech Talk show  Possibly on  Your channel 
[03:07:00]  Oh Jimmy  Tech Talk with Jim Norton  I heard it from Kevin Straley yesterday  Maybe Jimmy's been behind the scenes  Here's how it goes  They introduce Jim Norton  I come in like this  I come from a cross room  I go  Hey  Ready for business  Slide over  Hey there  No you know what it is  They say  Jim where you been  I said  I've been over at the test desk  The text desk  You're the dummy  The text desk  The text desk  The tech desk  You can't even say 
[03:07:30]  I'm so computer savvy  That the words don't matter anymore  What was the one you had earlier today  That was  That was really good  I've been flubbing words all day  But a bar's tail was terrific  It was worth it  Here's how computer savvy Norton is  He called me a couple weeks ago  Because he wants some help with his  He got  Ixnay on the kiddie porn questionnaire  Oh not that  Oh I'm sorry  Go ahead  He wants to know  Because he got this  Two terabyte external hard drive  And he wants to  You know 
[03:08:00]  Interface it with his computer  And so  I delicately take him into  Some disk management properties  And tell him that he needs to  Format the two terabyte drive  So that it will be compatible  With his PC  Because it's compatible for Mac  And so I said  You know what  Jim let me come over  Because this makes me very nervous  I know you've got all these pictures  Of Ozzy and all this stuff  On this hard drive  On your main computer  I don't want this to screw up  He's like  No no no  I could do this  I just select one of these  And hit format right  And I'm like  No no no no  This could go very badly 
[03:08:30]  Very badly  I heard the great thing about Jimmy  When he wants some help  With tech support  Is he doesn't really want your help  He just wants to be on the  Somebody on the phone  So that he can say  This is what I'm going to do  And you tell him  Oh maybe you shouldn't do that  He's like whatever  Fuck you  This is what I'm going to do  No I still by the way  Spent hours yesterday  Trying to format the other side  For Mac  I'm still having a nightmare  Time with it  But it makes me really nervous  When you're saying  Oh I'll just format these drives  I was just waiting for you  To wipe out your entire PC  No no no  Believe me it wasn't

[03:20:00]  To every single idea  Right Danny  Yes  There's another one  Wait a second  What  Earl wants to know  If he can do a show  With Vernon Reed  Why not  Vernon Reed  From Living Color  Black Rock Coalition  Baby  Yep  On 202  In the near future  Danny I think it's time  To expand  How many hours  Of live programming  On Saturday  Are you ready for it  There seems to be  Too many people  Who want to do shows  I think we go  After midnight  Can't we do 12 to 3 now  Which is 9 to 12 
[03:20:30]  On the west coast  Obviously  I guess we could  Yeah talk to Don  Say we're ready  To do 12 to 3 now  As well  Because there's too many shows  There's podcasts  I want to get involved now  And all sorts of shows  I got a call  From stupid Bob Kelly  And he actually had the gall  To give me shit  Because I said his show  That no one was listening to  And he had Big A  Remember when Big A said  That he had had a wife  Right  He goes  That was all because of me  That's what he's saying 
[03:21:00]  He goes  It was on my show  He goes  I was doing the show  I got it out of him  And I was like  You know  He calls me up  To bitch  That I said  Nobody listened to the show  But the truth is  No one listened to the show  And the only reason  Big A talked to him  Is because they have  The same body type  And the only reason  You guys knew about it  Was because an email  Was sent out  Saying hey  Nobody knew Big A was married  No one called in with it  No one called in our show  Because they  Really didn't hear it  Bob you're not Rush Limbaugh  You don't have the Rush Limbaugh audience 
[03:21:30]  You got the same body shape  Right  Alright more time  For awful shows  Coming up  Coming up  Keep listening  Keep listening to the channel  On our awful show Saturday  Yeah  We'll expand the hours  Of live programming on Saturday  We'll get that done  In the near future  What  What  Yes  Sweetie what  I don't know  He's reaching over for something  Hello Ralphie  Hey  What's going on kids  What's up Ralphie  It's Ralphie May

[03:22:30]  My friend  I  Talking about  I got shows  In Piven  New Jersey  At a theater  Oh wow  Listen to him  Ed Norton  Well I got shows  See  I'm trying  I'm trying  I'm frazzled  Where are you  I'm in Philadelphia  Oh  Good old Philly  So why not talk to the number one morning show in Philadelphia

[03:24:00]  Just because I just ran through the material  What is butt plug karaoke?  Yes  One of their stunt guys  Their wacky guy  He puts a butt plug in his mouth  And tries the same karaoke  You know Philly  Holy shit Philly  You know Philly  Philly go fuck yourself  Fuck you  Fuck you and your fuck holes  Go just all fuck yourself in Philly  You're listening to that shit  Holy shit  Yeah that's what they did  That's what I got pumped for

Oh  I was supposed to be on for 30 minutes  But I was only on for like 20 maybe  Less I think  I think like three breaks  Three breaks in 20 minutes  What the hell  And they uh  What's he  They wound up playing butt plug karaoke  Yeah  What faggots they are  Put it in your mouth and sing karaoke 
[03:25:00]  I swear to god  That's um  Was it at least a dirty butt plug?  Of course it wasn't  I actually thought it was going to be a little edgy  Right  And they were going to actually put it up his ass  And have him sing and have to hold it in  And make him sing like Journey  Like real high songs  And just have it chewed out across the room  That would be awesome  And that would be on y'all's show  Because y'all wouldn't have balls enough to do that  It would be good  Lube it up real good  Shove it up his ass  And have him sing a fucking Dio song  And watch  And his buddy has to be right behind him 
[03:25:30]  So it hits him in the face  Like fucking Armageddon  Like the little mouse  Ralphie where are the shows?

[03:26:30]  Is he's going to get  A 75 minute special  On HBO  That's right  I want an hour and six  Yeah he's going to go  For the hour and a six  Minute slot  Because it's been awful  Hey Ralph  Ralphie are you a father yet?  Yes  We had the baby  Six weeks ago  Wow  Oh  Yeah  I was there in the delivery room  Wow  Wait  I want to get y'all's wishes  What?  I  I listened to y'all's show  One time in  D.C.  And y'all talking about  Don't go in  Don't go into the delivery room 
[03:27:00]  Alright so wait wait wait wait  So you're in the delivery room  Your wife is about to give birth  Like it's one of the most  Beautiful moments  That I could think of  On the spot  Right?  Right Ralphie?  So let us all in on that  How is it to be in the delivery room  When your wife is delivering  Your first child?  Uh  It  Oh god no  Oh no 
[03:27:30]  I  I have to acknowledge  The one listener  That's decided  We're important enough  To see live  Today  By the way  One lonely soul  On the bleachers  Out there  He was shaking his head  He saw this coming  A mile  Oh yeah  Fucking way  Yeah  Yeah that was  He knew it  Oh  Oh  Oh that was nasty  Yeah see we tried 
[03:28:00]  And it didn't work there  Then  Me and Than  Are in hell  No one understands  Heck  It's going now  Yeah of course  Why'd you look weird  What happened?  You just looked  Back here weird  Oh I think  You were looking  At the listener  Oh I did  Yeah I wanted to see  Where he was  And what camera  Um I could get him on  So the rest of the people  At home could  Could see  He looks like me  Bigger version of me  Yeah  No  Here's a fax  From Cooter in Orlando 
[03:28:30]  Who sends me a copy  Of a story  That appeared  In the Los Angeles Times  He says  A prestigious  A prestigious newspaper  Not the oft maligned  Weekly World News  Quoting the story  In retrospect  Lighting the match  Was my big mistake  But I was only trying  To retrieve the gerbil  Eric Tomaszewski  Told the news doctors  In the severe burns unit  Of Salt Lake City Hospital  Tomaszewski  And his homosexual partner 
[03:29:00]  Andrew Kinky Farnham  Had been admitted  For emergency treatment  After a felching session  Had gone seriously wrong  I pushed a cardboard tube  Up his rectum  And slipped ragged  Our gerbil in  He explained  As usual  Kinky shouted out  Armageddon  My cue  That he'd had enough  I tried to retrieve ragged  But he wouldn't come out again  So I peered into the tube  And struck a match  Thinking the light  Might attract him 
[03:29:30]  At a hushed press conference  A hospital spokesman  Described what happened next  The match ignited  A pocket of intestinal gas  Gas and flame  Shot out the tube  Igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair  And severely burning his face  It also set fire  To the gerbil's fur  And whiskers  Which in turn  Ignited a larger pocket of gas  Further up the intestine  Propelling the rodent out 
[03:30:00]  Like a cannonball  Armageddon  I'm a gun  I'm a gun  I'm a gun  I'm a gun  Tomaszewski  Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns  And a broken nose  From the impact of the gerbil  While Furnum suffered first and second degree burns  To his anus and lower intestinal tract 
[03:30:30]  Time again  Peered into the tube  And struck a match  Thinking the light  Might make the gerbil come out  So that's what felching is all about 
[03:31:00]  Armageddon  Who says that?  I didn't  Robert E. Raven  On the John Boy and Billy show  That was the newscaster  From the John Boy and Billy show  That's how they reported it  Back in the day I guess  Armageddon  Is this really news?  We have MSNBC on in the studio  And the battle over pooch  Has turned into legal showdown  Yes  The Ellen doggy drama 
[03:31:30]  This is news  Yes  Can I say that the woman  Who runs that shelter  Comes off like such a cunt  Yeah of course  Just give the fucking dog back  What a fucking cunt  Yeah  I know better  You cunt  They got like home video  Of Ellen crying on the couch  Of the little girl  With the little girl  In her house  That woman is such a fucking cunt  And was that video  Was that video of the woman  Taking the dog  They got that too?  I don't know  They just showed a whole bunch  Of video pertaining to 
[03:32:00]  The whole Ellen DeGeneres thing  The woman was like  If Ellen thinks she knows better  She can run it  But I know what I'm doing  If you're a real fucking  She's just a cunt  There's no saying that  You made a mistake  In this situation  You know  You could say  I know how to run the place  Better than Ellen does  But maybe in this situation  We're going by the rules  And the rules can be bent  For this situation  Just something  But no  I know better  Arrogant shithead  Do we have audio of her?  Yeah we're trying to get it  But that story is news today

[03:57:00]  Uh  Jeez  You're talking about  Um  I don't remember  Ah it's alright  How was Ripe TV  Ah it was great  It was awesome  Hot chicks  Models  What happened  Hot chicks  And models  How many showed up  At least  I don't know  Several dozen  We were there for  Four hours  And it was  Several dozens  That really is a vague  Vague  That could be  That could be  24 people  Or it could be like 
[03:57:30]  A hundred and  Something divisible  By twelve  Oh they were still  Going out the  You know  The line was going out  The door when we had to leave  So  We were off the clock  So you were there  Several hours  Like how many  Stinky fingers  Did you walk out with  Than  Should have been plenty  Better be ten each  Better be ten boys  Hanging out with models  Like that  You should be poking  Poking their poop chutes  Yeah  But um  I was just saying  If half of these chicks  End up on  Ripe TV  It'll be worth  Watching right there 
[03:58:00]  Oh  You know what though  I think they're  Shilling for Ripe TV  What is Ripe TV  I uh  It's so cool  It's this uh  On demand  TV service  That's on  On demand channels  All over the place  And online  At RipeTV.com  And it's just full  Of hot chicks  And fast cars  And I mean  Everything a guy  Could possibly want  On demand  Whenever you want it  Yeah  Yeah it's great  When you demand it  Yeah  Like the Indy 500  Yeah  Except maybe 
[03:58:30]  A piece of pussy  Wrestling  Wrestling videos  Not yet  But I mean  You see that  Fucking plug  Come apart  There's enough  On Ripe TV  To keep me  Interested  And that's a lot  So  Yeah  Oh  They were looking  For a new  Hostess  For one of their  Shows  Yeah  And that's what  You guys did  The model search  Yes  Were you just  Messing with them  And stuff  Yeah we asked  Them a few  Funny questions  Like what  What was one of  The  You had a couple  Good ones  A couple of  Zingers  Yeah I mean

[03:59:30]  Site as Rape TV  So she was  Yeah  Oh well that's  Probably not good  I don't think  Rape TV wants  To have that  No  As their name  And most of the  Girls thought  That we were  Trying to find  Miss Right  And were pitching  Them when it was  Actually Miss Right  Oh they didn't  They didn't read  No  Very well  Not strong readers  No  No  Oof  Especially because  Miss Right  The director  Behind the camera  Was wearing a t-shirt  That just said  Ripe right across it  Yeah 
[04:00:00]  Yeah  And were the girls  Did they have to  Maybe get a little  Scantily clad  In order to  Oh yeah  They were in bikinis  Oh okay  Alright  Any nice fat bulges  No bulges  No  Only hot chicks  Just hot chicks  Not one slob  Showed up  Yeah  Oh okay  Oh there was  There were a couple  That were stronger  In the personality  Department than the  Looks department  Oh okay  Wow you could  Spin a positive  On anything  Can't you  Yeah  It looked like they  Had a sea urchin  In their underpants  Nice bulging sea urchin 
[04:00:30]  There was one chick  That was there  Trying out  That was also  On Rock of Love  She was only on  Like the first episode  It was the really crazy  So celebrities  Were showing up  Besides us  There was somebody  From Rock of Love  There was somebody  From America's Next Top Model  Wow  They just wanted to be  On Ripe TV  Because it's hot  It is  It is  When do you guys  Get a haircut  Hmm  Why would they need  A haircut  Well Sam's hair  Is getting a little bushy  Are you going for the afro  No I just haven't  Gotten the haircut  Please keep growing it 
[04:01:00]  It's getting a little bushy  I want it to look like  You did when you were  On that little show  Where you flipped the coin  Off of your ankle  My hair wasn't even long  You just wanted to  Bring that up  Oh it was  Afro wars  Afro wars  Ron and Fez  Oh no  We got Sam  Who are you bringing  To the table  For afro wars  Is Dave's hair straight  Or very curly  Afro-ish  Well yeah Dave  Can you grow an afro  As good as me Dave  Dude  Probably not 
[04:01:30]  A lot of people like to  Put the two shows together  And call it you know  Afro shows  I say afro wars  Afro wars  I'm trying to think  We got Sam  It's on  It's on  Afro war  Would Fezzy have an afro  If he grew his hair  Really long  Or does it grow straight  He's got a bright blonde  Mohawk right now  I know  And he puts it in spikes  With Elmer's glue  Look man  They could use a white guy  They could get the perm  I don't give a shit  Oh Earl though  They got Earl  Anything  I didn't even think of that  Anything goes  Afro wars  They got a black man 
[04:02:00]  It's natural  He ain't beating me  But he can't do it  Mine's natural  He keeps it shaved  Oh I know  But you know  It's more natural on him  Earl  Because he's more black than you  I'm too pretty for Earl  Oh look  You're like Ali  I'm too pretty  Look at Earl come in  Like he's like a prize fighter  I know  Earl  This is like how  Sugar Ray Leonard  Dressed before  He fucking fought man  All smooth and shit  Earl  What's up Earl  What about an afro  I know that at some point  During the Ron and Fez show  You were growing your hair  Badly 
[04:02:30]  Badly  But you were growing it  And do you think  You could get a big afro going  Bigger than our own Sam  Could get  No I won't  Because I'm thinning in the top  I'm untouchable  That's what you  You're untouchable  That's what you call  But can't the rest of the afro grow out  You'll have like a James Evans afro  Because he had a little  You know  A little bald spot thing going  So you could have like  James Evans  Let me see the thinning on top  It would thin up here 
[04:03:00]  And on the sides here  It was really bad  Man it's like a fucking  Pond  Why's your head so shiny  Earl  He shines it  Do you  Yeah  That's what you  He has to shine  What do you shine it with  I put like a  Aftershave balm on it  Neva  You really do look like  You should have an axe  In your chest  Yeah  Doesn't he really start looking like  Simply for your work performance  Why do you have 
[04:03:30]  Why do you shine your head  Because after you shave it  You don't want  You won't  Create a head  Because he gets bumps  Razor bumps  Black people are plagued  With sickle cell  And razor bumps  Are the two like  Really bad things  I'm sorry  Those are the two  Really bad things  Yeah  Those razor bumps  Are really bad  Isn't that just the  Direction you shave in  And whatever you use  Before and after you shave  I've tried everything  I get them too  Earl  You get razor bumps  Of course you do  Look 
[04:04:00]  Oh my god  He does  It's true  You have so much  Black blood in you  You just happen to turn out  The black  Like the color of your skin  Isn't black  But that's like it  I have to go to the black  Haircare aisle  To try to find stuff  To put on my  Do you have to do that  Yeah  You get like black people  Pictures on your products  When are you going to stop  Trying to convince people  That you're white  Let's just get this  Out of the way  When you go up  To the counter with that  Do they kind of chuckle 
[04:04:30]  No that would be racist  They don't chuckle  No I would chuckle at you  Because it's like  Oh here's this poor kid  He's young  But he's got the afro  And he's got to buy  Black man stuff  For his hair  You know  No they haven't  I'm sure they do  When I leave  But not to my face  That's like a red headed  Freckled black guy  That's kind of like  Isn't that silly  In the black community  That's kind of silly  Malcolm X had red hair  What's that  Malcolm X had red hair  That's right  How do you know  Earl let's be honest  I know a lot of stuff  His nickname was Red 
[04:05:00]  Detroit Red  Detroit Red  Detroit Red  I know what's going on here  Earl's blackness  Looks down at Sam's blackness  Right Earl  I know how it goes  Well there's inter-race racism  Right  And in the black community  It's the lighter you are  The more the black  The darker black people  Don't like you  Like Manute Bull  Is the king of all blacks  Oh yeah  I know Howard's got a king  Of all black character  But let's be honest  Manute Bull is the king  Of all blacks  Absolutely  He was extremely African  With Mickey Rivers 
[04:05:30]  Right there  Close second  Yep  Then he got like  People  Wesley Snipes  Very good  Wesley's pretty  Pretty dark  Flavor Flav  Holy shit  He's way up there  Flav  He's part of the king's  Crew  You know who was like  Not even real looking  Was  What's his name  The trumpet guy there  Dizzy  No  Miles  Miles  Oh shit  Miles Davis looked like  He was made out of copper

[04:06:30]  I'm still trying to  Figure out what it means  Was it so what  Or Freddy Freeloader  Whoa  Whoa look at Miles man  That poor photographer  Must have had a nervous  Breakdown  After having to light  Miles Davis  That's actually  During a nuclear explosion  Was the only way  To get enough light  To light him  For that split second  I was thinking  The photographer  Had to put him  On a treadmill  For an hour  To get a little shine  Going so you could see  Oh so he could sweat  A little bit  Beat up 
[04:07:00]  Ah here you go  Yeah  A little kind of blue  This is Miles Davis  Everybody  If you're into this  It's great  Nice blue turtleneck  He's wearing too  Little Miles Davis  Miles isn't playing  The piano  By the way  Miles comes in  Bill Evans  Bill Evans  No  The weather guy  Yes  Bill Evans  A man of many parts  Where were we  Oh so Afro Wars  We got our guy man  Fuck the radio wars  Fuck the eating shit  Who gives a crap right

[04:12:00]  It'll  It'll bulk up nicely  Quickly  Yeah  Unlike Earl  Who will have very tight  Black guy curls  Which will take a while  To grow into a big  Angela Davis  White person hating  60's type  Afro  Not white person hating  Well  You know  That's what I like to call it  The legend of  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Alright  Challenge on  Alright  I say on this side

[04:17:30]  Through Foundry  Oh I really like to work  For those guys  Fuck you  Oh  Must have been a roid day  Two of the biggest stars  Of the Ron Fett show  Could have been ours  Please  Could have been ours  Fuck you  We really missed the  Missed the train on that one  Look at that  Yeah  Now your hair  Yeah  How does that grow  When it grows really out  Like pubic  Is it an afro  It's 
[04:18:00]  I mean literally  Like pubic  Like pubic hair  It's currently  Disgusting  And all over the place  So it could be considered  Sort of a nappy  Afro thing  Yeah  Alright  I used to have my hair  A little bit longer  And then people would  Do the carrot top jokes  And  Oh okay  So is it almost  Carrot top-ish  Because you know  I'm a fucking Gallagher fan  So  Well yeah  You're gonna be  Prop comic  You stick with the old  You gotta go to the top  To me  A giant couch  With things behind the cushions 
[04:18:30]  Kicks ass on a toilet seat  With wheels  Yeah  I mean  It's no competition  Plunge your remote controls  Enough  So I  I would grow it long  But then you know  I would get those comparisons  So  And then one day  I was  On skates too  By the way  He did it all on skates  By the way  People are confused  About the black girl hire  For Ranafez  Just think baseball  These guys were in our  In our farm system  Bronx Johnny and Eastside Dave  And we kind of let them  Just hang out in  Single A ball  And then you had  The old veteran 
[04:19:00]  So you know  We threw in the  Two young guys  With the old veteran  Yeah  You know  Just throw in  The old veteran  His last shot  At the big leagues  That's what happened  That's what happened  That is what happened  Now these are  These two guys  Are in the starting rotation  Yeah  And the veteran  Is like the pitching coach now  Bronx Johnny  What about your hair  How does that grow  I'm going to grow up  Violent  I'm going to grow up  Completely  The jerry curls on me  At the end  Oh shit  At the tip  I used to have a jerry curl  When I was 12  But it  I'm getting picked on  I let it go 
[04:19:30]  Oh yeah  The jerry curls  Just  Yeah  I used to wear the fishnet  Like a headband  And all that shit  Yeah  At school with the juice  With the juice  It was like 94  So that really wasn't  Popping on me  Nah nah  Like that's kind of  An 80s thing  Yeah  A little bit  A little 80s thing  But if you grow that dry  What's that going to come out like  It's going to be puffy  It'll probably just  It'll be  It'll puff up  But it'll keep straight  Like a Mexican bandito  Right  I got you  Mexican bandito  That's how that works out  I want to see you  With the bandoliers  And  Six guns 
[04:20:00]  So are you guys in  For Afro Wars  Yeah  I mean  Fucking A  I'm in Frank  You're going to beat him  Alright  You're not going to touch me Dave  With a hairdo  Afro Wars  You can't touch me  I will grow  You can't beat me  I will grow such a beautiful head of hair  And perms are allowed  You can enhance it with a perm  If you feel like you need more curl to your Afro  You're going to have to add something  Because you're not going to beat me  Talk and smack  And I understand  Let's be proud then  I understand you guys are a very gay show 
[04:20:30]  So we can do a  I know  There's a lot of man kissing  I don't know what that means  So just to make you guys feel a little more comfortable  We'll also do a hairy ball contest  We got  I'm going to be the loser  We'll pick one of our guys  We've seen your balls  I just want to show you  Nah it's alright  Look he goes  I just want to show you  He's so eager to pull out his balls  Hence a very gay show  Oh he's got nothing going on there  See just in case  He's got nothing going on there  These guys are as gay as they comfort  I don't know what that means  I don't think there's anything wrong 
[04:21:00]  He's got nothing  What do you shave it down?  I try to Mr. Anthony  It must look like a phone company guy  Was in there stripping a wire  And nipping it in your sink or something  So we'll do hairy balls too  We'll find one of the guys on staff  That's willing to grow his ball hair  Until the end of the year  It's all Danny  Oh yeah  See we got a fucking ringer  When it comes to that one too  That's hard  Danny will be the hairy ball guy  Everyone has their roles  And of course we're going to pick Sam  For the live action 
[04:21:30]  Danny  Danny comment  Why am I hairy ball guy?  You look on the outside  Like you'd have the hairiest ball  And I do remember a video  From the office once  Where you were dancing around  With your dick and balls hanging up  I think I still have that  On a computer somewhere  You don't make enough money  To get enough razors  To keep that under control  That's insane  I think if we're doing hairy balls  I think you gotta go Steve  Steve?  Oh he is Lebanese  I think I'm more Afro  But that'll  You could grow an Afro 
[04:22:00]  Dude I gotta try to find pictures  From back to back  Well honestly God  Pat Tuffy's listening  I'll figure out where  But we want to start an Afro wall  Alright let's bring in some pictures  I will bring pictures tomorrow  Because I got them on my computer  It's easy  I got a bunch of my family pictures  I'll bring in some of me  I know I have just a slamming Afro  Back in the day  I uh  Is it just  I'm sorry  Is it just um balls?  Because I think that  The way it's at 
[04:22:30]  See  Sure sure  See these guys always have to make it gayer  No  See  This is what they do on their show  I was gonna say  That our intern Lily  Being that she's Muslim  Could probably have the hairiest  Oh like a hairy bush  Is she willing to show that?  What do we got?  I doubt it  Some money man  We need a girl  Travis  Travis  Girl against girl man  Travis against Lily  What happened?  Will you show your hairy clam?  No I see  That's a misconception  I don't have a hairy clam 
[04:23:00]  It's shameless  No clam at all actually  Why?  Turn up the miles  Oh you're a boy?  Yeah boy  I didn't understand that  Alright so we got the Afro  We got the hairy ball contest  And possibly a hairy bush contest  Harry bush  It's Afro Wars  Alright let's do it  I like it  Let's try to keep the gay out of this bit for once  Alright  Oh so we're not going for the hairiest asshole  Well that's where I thought it was  Jesus Christ  Because there's no manipulating that really  You don't want to shave your asshole  No  Because once those pricklies grow in 
[04:23:30]  You're gonna have a problem  Yeah  And you can't really  Oh Jesus  What is that?  What is that?  What is he showing your picture?  Who is that?  Derek's balls  Oh that's Derek?

Everyone's seen Danny's balls  We've seen also  We saw Danny in that Borat swimsuit  Yeah  Oh the hair  That was flying out of the side of that  You're right  The Borat suit  I think I've seen stubble grow on Danny's teeth  Yeah  He's a very hairy  Like guy  Danny kid  You'd be our go-to hairy ball guy  If that's who I gotta be  Alright  Who do you guys got for hairy ball?  I would say either Pepper Hicks 
[04:24:30]  Or Johnny  I'd let him grow up  Is Johnny doing something now?  Are you doing a different thing?  I would've done a fro thing  Can I let my head grow up  But I'd do the balls  You could do a little bit of everything  Balls?
