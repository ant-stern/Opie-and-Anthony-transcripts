<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, a Friday broadcast, began with the usual raucous introduction and crude jokes from Opie and Anthony, targeting their colleagues' appearances.  They discussed a listener's seemingly delusional claim, then their own lax work ethic, before shifting to cynical commentary on the presidential inauguration and the Iraq war, including darkly humorous predictions about the upcoming Iraqi elections.  The conversation veered towards their dislike of winter and their privileged lives, contrasting it with the mundane reality of their time off.  Opie recounted a lengthy anecdote about his boredom observing his neighbors, focusing on a woman's dog's defecation and his own amusement at others stepping in it.  This led to a discussion of his apartment decor (Pottery Barn rocks) and his ongoing feud with noisy upstairs neighbors, prompting anecdotes about neighborly disputes in New York City. They also discussed a police ride-along and the bizarre calls they received.  Anthony shared a story of being punched by his girlfriend's violent ex-husband.  A garbled call from Barney about Jim Norton's sexually suggestive comments on sensitivity training concluded this segment.  Scheduled guests included Colin Quinn, Keith Robinson (whose appearance was cancelled), Ralphie Mays, and "Stalker Patty."

The next segment opened with a humorous advertisement for a fictional "Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook."  A news story about a man throwing coffee at a meter maid led to a rant against meter maids and their aggressive ticketing practices. A caller described a disgusting movie-going experience, and another criticized Jim Norton, leading to a back-and-forth. The hosts then debated Simon Cowell's comments about overweight triplets on *American Idol*, prompting further calls and opinions on both Norton and the *American Idol* situation.  The segment concluded with a discussion – using highly offensive language – about the feud between Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono over the use of "Yesterday."

The following segment began with a discussion of an offensive song about child abuse, quickly transitioning to listener calls, including a dubious Beatles anecdote.  A humorous, crude song about Paul McCartney's wife was played. TJ, a former listener, called in, prompting comments about his changed appearance.  The focus shifted to the backlash against Ashley Simpson's disastrous Orange Bowl performance, including playing audio of the booing crowd and Simpson's dismissive comments.  The 90s music was debated, interspersed with tangents including a listener's dislike of the show.  Ralphie May called in, engaged in a tense exchange with Opie (resulting in Opie hanging up and later apologizing), and shared behind-the-scenes gossip about Simpson's meltdown, including throwing a chair and her father's confrontation with organizers.  The segment ended with discussions about a listener's near-death bicycle accident and awkward childhood experiences, followed by Patty bringing belated Christmas gifts – personalized desk plaques – for Opie and Anthony, triggering further banter.

The next segment prominently featured Patty and her awkwardly presented Christmas gifts, which Opie and Anthony harshly rejected, suggesting they be sold on eBay.  Opie revealed a heart valve problem potentially requiring open-heart surgery, and Patty’s accent was mocked. After Patty left, Jimmy expressed intense dislike for her, leading to further offensive commentary about her appearance and mannerisms.  Ben called to comment on Jay Mohr's missed appearances.  The hosts played a segment of their "Top Ten Songs of the 90s" countdown, sparking discussion, followed by criticism of songs about George W. Bush and John Ashcroft from jibjab.com.  A call with Lady Di, described as an alcoholic with personal problems, including the death of her son's father, concluded before Colin Quinn arrived in studio.

The final segment featured Colin Quinn discussing his post-*Tough Crowd* life, projects, and lack of news consumption.  They shared opinions on Nicole Kidman's attractiveness, discussed an up-and-coming comedian named Nathaniel ("Than"), and movie remakes like *Black Honeymooners*.  A caller recounted seeing Jenna Bush at the inauguration, prompting sexually suggestive comments.  They played a CNN audio clip of an inauguration protest.  A discussion about a tsunami benefit show at the Comic Strip, featuring various comedians,  followed, with Quinn expressing skepticism about aid reaching its intended recipients.  This led to a lengthy discussion filled with dark humor, sexually suggestive remarks, and offensive jokes about the tsunami and its victims, referencing Ralphie May's alleged activities in Thailand.  The conversation returned to Quinn's comedic style, before concluding with a voicemail from Jimmy's mother advising him to replace prostitution with gym workouts.

[00:03:30]  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like quirly spliced stuff.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Hawk-a-tosis.  Eric, you're not gonna cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed. 
[00:06:00]  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just big.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:06:30]  I'm gonna need you to go ahead and come in tomorrow.  So if you could be here around nine, that would be great.  Okay?  Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.  Um, I'm also gonna need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday, too.  Okay?  We need to sort of play catch-up.  Thanks.  I generally come in at least 15 minutes late. 
[00:07:00]  Uh, and after that, I just sort of space out for about an hour.  I just stare at my desk.  But it looks like I'm working.  I do that for, uh, probably another hour after lunch, too.  I'd say in a given week, I'd probably only do about 15 minutes of real, actual work.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I'm scared of you. 
[00:07:30]  I'm scared.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm scared of you.  Please call the police.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm protecting myself.  He was banging clucks that way. 
[00:08:00]  Two at a time.  I don't care how many Jago, Guinea, Walk, Greaseball, Goombas, Cavado, no one's worth.  Always a fave.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program, the Friday edition.  How is everybody?  Oh, good.  Goody good.  Goody good.  I hate winter. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, we all do.  It is just awful, man.  You once said, Anthony and I have been doing radio for 10 years now, and you...  I once said, ask not what your country can do for you.  Eh.  Eh.  Hello?  You were listening to that crap and watching that crap yesterday?  No.  Eh.  I totally skipped the inauguration coverage.  It's the same thing.  Worry.  Nothing changes in this country.  They did a montage on CNN of all the past presidents talking about the great vision for America and stuff. 
[00:09:00]  And I'm like, what year is this?  Yeah.  Richard Nixon said a lot of the same crap that Bush said yesterday, that Clinton said eight years ago, that Bush said four years ago, that Kennedy said 30-some-odd years ago, right?  40-some-odd years ago.  My second term, I'll talk about the Jews.  Where's my speech writer?  Write something nice about the Negroes.  They all talk about the vision for America.  Same old crap, man. 
[00:09:30]  The vision.  Nothing really changes.  He's talking about spreading freedom, Bush.  Spreading freedom around the world.  Is that really our...  Because it's working out so well.  I was going to ask, is that really our choice?  Apparently with him in charge, it's pretty high up on his priorities.  It's because that's what God wants?  Yeah.  We need to free everybody around the world?  If someone wants freedom, he's saying, America will be there to back you up.  Hey, sounds like a great idea.  I'm just wondering if that's our decision. 
[00:10:00]  That's all.  That's all I'm asking.  It's a good movie plot, but in reality, it doesn't work out too well as you look at people being blown up daily.  You know, it just doesn't quite work out.  You know, it's really not working out well in Iraq.  I can't wait to see those elections.  That's going to be fun.  That's the polling place is just exploding.  That's good.  Go out and vote.  They can't even give away the location of the polling places to the populace.  What kind of turnout is there going to be? 
[00:10:30]  Well, you're just going to have to hunt for it.  You're just going to have to look.  Look for the ticking car, and it's right next to it.  That's where the polls are.  And you know how they're going to figure it out?  The citizens of Iraq.  It's going to be in the cryptic quote.  Is that what it's going to be?  They're going to have to figure out the cryptic quote.  Stupid newspaper with words that don't make any sense.  And then eventually they'll figure out where the polling place is.  They can't tell anybody because the insurgents will just go there and kill everybody.  I just picture that as being a...  You know how they say, oh, there's terrorist threats against the inauguration and stuff, 
[00:11:00]  and they were saying that security is really heightened.  Yeah.  But the reality is it'll go off without a hitch because they can secure a location pretty well here in this country.  Oh, I know, because they were showing Bush and his wife their walk-in.  And a lot of people are like, wow, kind of brave guy there walking, huh, in this day and age.  Like he's taking a lap around the XM Studios.  No, believe me, that road is secured.  The people have been searched, and they know every person that's in the crowds on the side of the road. 
[00:11:30]  But it's not like Iraq where they have no clue.  There's no way they can send people there to vote and have it secure.  It's just going to be blowing up.  Well, I think the Sunni Muslims are the ones who are...  Because they know they're going to wind up losing.  Yeah.  The Shiites are the ones who are, I think, oppressed for all those years.  So I think the majority does want to vote.  Yeah, but the Shiites have had enough, I think.  It doesn't matter.  The majority doesn't matter, though.  It's these insurgents. 
[00:12:00]  It's the people that feel disenfranchised in the election and the people that just want to tear stuff up.  They don't want anything going on in there.  There's people, there's just plain kooks with guns and weapons over there that don't have an agenda or anything.  They just want to kill people, you know, and those are the most dangerous.  You don't know what the hell their agenda is.  So they're, you know, sitting there setting off roadside bombs, and that election's just going to be a disaster.  But they'll get on the news and say, you know, they'll parade people in front and say, it's a great success. 
[00:12:30]  It's our first steps toward freedom in Iraq.  And then we'll move on to the next country to free them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good morning.  I know, right?  Good morning to you.  What I was going to say, though, real simple, you've said in years past that the older you get, the worse you hate winter or whatever, right?  Yeah.  As a kid, it was kind of cool, you know, there's a snowstorm that's going to, it's barreling down, it's going to hit us here on the East Coast. 
[00:13:00]  Yep.  And now they're saying, I don't know, it could be up to like some ridiculous, a foot to 18 inches of snow.  In our area.  We're not going to Washington, that's obvious.  Yeah.  When are we calling that off?  It's supposed to be Sunday, but I don't know, what time are we leaving Sunday?  That's where the storm's going to hit the worst, they're saying.  This is Saturday night into Sunday.  When are we leaving?  Sunday.  Sunday morning?  Sunday morning?  We're not going to Washington.  Would there be a problem with the train, though? 
[00:13:30]  Just getting there.  No, we're not going to Washington if there's a snowstorm, so cancel that trip, all right?  If I don't have to drive down the expressway during a blizzard, I'd rather not, if I don't have to.  I'll come in on Monday.  It'll be nice.  The roads will be plowed.  It was a good idea to go to Washington, but it's not going to happen.  It was.  So call up Elo and tell him to reschedule, okay?  Simple as that.  But I must be 80 years old, because I can't stand this winter crap anymore, is the point I was going to try to make here.  That's why all those old farts go to Florida. 
[00:14:00]  They can't take it.  My bones are brittle.  It hurts my knee joints.  You know, when you're growing up and you hear about the older people splitting their time between New York and Florida, you kind of think they're kind of kooky and stupid.  But then you get older and you're like, they're on to something.  As a kid, snow is cool.  It's something to do.  It's something to play in.  It keeps you out of school.  So it's something that's fun when you see snow.  As an adult, you see snow.  And unless you're going skiing, you're at the ski resort, you see snow and it's just a pain in the ass. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  You're shoveling driveways.  It's a pain in the ass to drive.  It's cold.  I hate it.  Well, you know, and we're lucky.  We got the type of job, if you want to call us a job.  Yeah, our job.  We really don't have to be here.  No?  We should be splitting our time.  Between a warm location.  We should be looking at apartments in West Palm Beach, Anthony.  Oh.  And we should be broadcasting from West Palm three to four months a year. 
[00:15:00]  There's no reason to be in New York.  Yeah, but Opie, it could cost you 15, 20 bucks to furnish both places.  That's, I don't know.  So, Ottomans split between two places?  Oof.  I was thinking about my life yesterday.  And you're still here?  Yeah, exactly.  It is, honestly, it's so pathetic.  You know, a lot of people admire Anthony and I and what we do.  I know that.  I understand that.  Tens of people, yeah.  We try to downplay it, but a lot of people do admire the fact that we have these really cool jobs. 
[00:15:30]  And, in a way, do I dare say we're looked at as rock stars.  Oof.  Hey, that's not me, you know, thinking high of myself.  It's just the email I read and stuff.  People really admire what we do, okay?  I see a few stalkers checking in.  And I'm sitting in Starbucks realizing how pathetic my life really is.  I mean, from 4 in the morning when I wake up to about 10.30 when we leave this joint, it's a pretty cool life. 
[00:16:00]  You know, we get to, you know, hang out with a bunch of guys that we like to hang with and laugh with.  And we get to meet big-time celebrities, and we get to goof on people.  It's a dream come true.  From 10.30 until 4 the next day, my life is just pretty much pathetic.  There's really nothing going on.  No, I sat in Starbucks for an hour.  I was so bored yesterday because everyone is working.  After we leave here, everyone else that is cool is working.  The only people that aren't working from, you know, 10 in the morning to, let's say, 5 in the late afternoon are losers. 
[00:16:30]  When I leave.  Or independently wealthy people.  Yep.  When I leave, there's still traffic coming into the city.  Yeah, because they're starting their day.  Yeah.  And everyone else that happens to not be working during those hours are losers for the most part.  I know there's a small percentage.  Hey, dude, no, my job, blah, blah, blah.  But in general, it's homeless people.  It's rich bitches walking around shopping.  Right.  Unemployed people trying to find a job.  How are you? 
[00:17:00]  It's pretty much the dregs of society from drunks waking up from their all-night bender.  Right.  So, I'm in Starbucks yesterday, just bored because I have to fill the time.  And I'm not even kidding you, dude.  I stared out the window.  I watched this effing lady with her stupid dog.  You know, the dog is walking.  You know, the lady has the dog on a leash.  And all of a sudden, the dog just stops.  All four paws stops.  And the lady drags the dog for 15, 20 feet.  Doesn't understand why the dog is stopping. 
[00:17:30]  On its little pads.  Oh, yeah.  Just sliding.  Because, you know, these people that have dogs, they should be shot.  Dogs in the city.  Is what should happen because they're, you know, whatever.  I have a whole thing on dogs in the city, but.  Unless you don't have corneas.  No, it's.  There's no reason to have a dog in this city.  What I don't get, in my neighborhood, in my neighborhood, you know, people in general  are just very lonely people that don't.  They're lonely.  And they don't want to communicate with anybody else.  You can walk the streets where I live, pretty much anywhere in the city. 
[00:18:00]  No one makes eye contact.  There's no interaction with anyone.  You know, you don't just say, hey, good morning, neighbor.  No, it's not L.A.  You know what I mean?  It's just like people just are miserable.  They just want to keep to themselves.  They don't want any human interaction whatsoever in Manhattan, okay?  But then what they do is they, what?  What did I do?  Nothing.  I'm listening to you.  I'm just.  Is this really boring?  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was just trying to do a radio show.  I feel bad about myself now.  Did I mispronounce something?  No.  Are you agreeing with me?  Yes. 
[00:18:30]  But it's just funny to hear you say like how, you know.  Go ahead.  People don't want to make eye contact.  They don't want to look at each other.  It just hit me.  It's very ironic because you're very guilty of that.  You're that guy.  But I'm trying not to be.  See, that's why I want to move back to the suburbs where people are effing human.  But I'm trying real hard.  So then these people realize that they're very lonely, so they get these stupid dogs.  Yeah.  And then they mistreat these dogs.  I see it all the time.  And I'm not an animal rights activist guy by any means, but I see these dogs just being 
[00:19:00]  abused because they thought it was a good idea, but then they realize that it's an effing  dog and it's Manhattan.  What am I going to do with this dog except walk it a couple of times a day and pick up  its crap on the sidewalk when it poops?  You could kick it in the liver, I guess, if you want.  So I watched this lady drag her little dog because the dog wanted to stop to take a crap and  she couldn't be bothered and finally realized, okay, I got to stop because I can't drag the 
[00:19:30]  dog all the way back to my apartment.  So the dog takes a nice crap.  It was a little dog, but man, it had a lot to get out of it.  Did she put the little plastic bag over her hand and pick up the load?  The whole thing.  See, here in New York City, there's a law that says you can't have your dog just take  a dump and leave it there.  You have to pick it up, physically pick it up and dispose of the crap.  Right.  So people have different techniques.  Some people you see walking around with a big piece of newspaper and they pick it up 
[00:20:00]  with the newspaper and throw it in the garbage pail.  Others have like this technique where they use a baggie over their hand, like a glove, inside  out kind of thing, and then they pick up.  It's a sandwich bag.  It's just a sandwich bag.  Yeah.  So they have the Ziploc thing and they do it inside out with their hand so when they  pick up the load of crap, they can pull it over their hand and the crap and then Ziploc  it.  Right.  But the problem is you're not touching the crap, but you can feel how warm it is.  You can feel the texture of it. 
[00:20:30]  There's just this really thin sheet of plastic between you and the crap.  Drives me nuts when I see it.  I can never do that.  It's disgusting.  If you want to have some dignity, if you've got logs, just take them over your chest and throw them  out like a decent human being.  Like a real man.  Yeah.  So, you know, so the dog craps and the lady picks up most of it.  Then there's a nice big, like, I don't know.  I'm trying to think.  Nugget?  It was a big nugget that was hanging from the dog's butt, you know, on one of its hairs.  It looked like someone dropped a Brax chocolate. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know, the dog turns around and the thing swings and launches itself and  boom, hits the sidewalk and the lady doesn't see it.  So now, dude, I'm such a bore and such an ass that I sat there looking out the window  rooting on people to step in it for like, I'm going to exaggerate, but at least, honestly,  at least 20 minutes.  That's pretty good, though.  That's fun.  What's wrong with that?  And then at one point, then at one point, this old lady kicks it and has no idea, you  know, she kicked it and it just starts rolling to another location on the sidewalk. 
[00:21:30]  You sure she kicked it or maybe she had done it and it went down her pant leg and as she  walked it flung out like our own little Jimmy.  And then every time someone stepped in it, because this thing had some hard consistency,  it didn't really smush too good, you know, but people were stepping on it.  I was laughing my ass off in the middle of Starbucks because I don't really care.  Yeah.  And people are looking at me like I'm out of my mind because they have no idea what  I'm doing.  They just see me staring out the window laughing really hard.  That sounds fun, though. 
[00:22:00]  I would sit there and watch that.  Absolutely.  Well, I'm a major people watcher, so that's one thing I like about living in Manhattan.  I could watch people all day long.  But so then I got bored with that and I'm thinking to myself, man, you know, only a few  hours earlier we were laughing our asses off, having a good time, making fun of Noah, the  new intern, and making fun of, you know, corporate and just goofing on each other.  And now I'm just watching people kick, you know, dog crap on the sidewalk.  And then I proceeded over to Pottery Barn to buy rocks. 
[00:22:30]  Wait a minute.  And that's when I thought, you know, my life really stinks.  Wait a minute.  I need to find new friends.  I need to find some new hobbies.  I got to get a life is what I'm saying.  Why were you buying rocks?  Well, because I've been to Jimmy's apartment.  Don't look at me, stupid.  I got the idea from you.  Are you ripping off some of Jimmy's house design techniques?  Jimmy's looking at me like he wants to make fun of me and smash me in the face.  And the fact is, I got this idea from you. 
[00:23:00]  I'm not saying it's bad to buy rocks, but I don't look at people stepping dog dump for  20 minutes before I do it.  I'm not saying it's wrong to purchase rocks.  Now, you're doing what Jimmy did in his little hallway?  I was bored.  You guys have been making fun of me about my empty apartment.  So I was walking by Pottery Barn after Tower Records.  And then I bought open water, by the way.  I can't wait to see that flick.  And then I went into Pottery Barn going, maybe I'll get a little something for the apartment. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  You were bored.  I'm really bored.  And you go to Pottery Barn to get something for your apartment and you decided on rocks?  Well, then all of a sudden they had a really nice display on one of the tables.  This is the problem with Pottery Barn.  And it kind of makes you look faggy.  I'm not going to lie.  It makes you look faggy, but I saw this little display on one of the tables.  I'm like, you know what?  That would look good in my apartment.  And it was just a little candle display with rocks in what could only be described as a 
[00:24:00]  canoe-type wooden vessel thing.  I've seen these before.  All right.  So it's like a canoe wooden vessel thing on top of a table with rocks in it.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  You will be molested.  Easy.  So it was like a canoe wooden dugout thing on a table with rocks in it and candles. 
[00:24:30]  I'm like, you know what?  I want that.  Pick it up for the place.  I'll find a place in my empty apartment for this.  Yeah, sure.  Maybe light the candles when I'm bored and just kind of throw on some new age music and have  a cup of tea and read a book with my afghan.  Maybe have Jay come over and bring our job.  Shut up.  I'm purposely trying to figure it out.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Relax.  So $144 later.  $144 for a canoe and some pebbles.  Right.  Did you buy the canoe too? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I bought the wooden...  Why?  You know which one I'm talking about, right?  Of course I do.  I believe you.  Where do you think I got my rocks idea from?  I just didn't buy the canoe.  I put them on the floor.  Right.  I've seen it.  You know, yeah, Jimmy in his apartment, the door from the bathroom to the door to his bedroom.  It's a little hallway.  It can't be more than, what, 10 feet?  I don't know, 6 feet, 8 feet?  Well, from the kitchen to the bathroom, then you get the bathroom, then a teeny little thing  He has the rocks thrown up against the wall with candles in the middle.  With candles in the rocks in the hallway. 
[00:25:30]  But I went one step further and I decided to get the wooden canoe thing.  The canoe thing and put the rocks in it.  So I had to buy everything individually.  She's like, here's the candles.  There's where the rocks are.  $10 a bag for rocks.  $10 a bag for rocks.  For pebbles.  What a pisser these people are.  And then the canoe.  And I'm thinking, nice little thing for the apartment.  What could it cost me?  $30?  Seriously, I'm thinking $30, $40 tops.  Not a pottery barn.  All of a sudden I hand my credit card in and she's like $144. 
[00:26:00]  I'm like, for what?  Ring it up.  Ring it up.  I was actually on the Pottery Barn website yesterday.  What a coinkie thing.  You know what I was looking for?  Take a guess.  Rocks?  Nope.  Candles?  Couch.  Oh, couch.  Booger remover and a couch.  I was looking for a couch.  Because there's still a stray booger on my couch.  It's a nice little thing to do in the apartment too now that we're on decorating tips.  Oh.  I bought it from this one place I go to, which everybody who works there is a moe. 
[00:26:30]  There's no way around it.  Right.  And it's like a glass thing that holds a candle.  And I put a big fat candle in it and a bunch of rocks around it.  And I locked around it.  Dude, I saw that too.  I might have to get that.  I might have to get that.  I like it, man.  Women love that stuff.  Candles.  I'm over the candles.  Oh, man.  Dude, I'm all...  I like it too.  I'm not going to lie.  It's not just for them.  I'm all about candles, you know, when I'm mellowing out, getting ready to crash.  Scented?  No.  Just turn off all the lights, throw some candles on.  I like a good vanilla-scented candle.  Dude, it's nothing I like more.  Vanilla-scented combo, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  It's like a milkshake in your house.  Yeah.  So, I bought all these scented candles, but I bought a lot of these weird scents because they  didn't have any vanilla, but I like the vanilla cinnamons.  They're very lovely.  The cinnamon's good, yeah.  And then, I'm a little off today and a little distracted, a little cranky and tired because  I had it out with the neighbors again last night.  Why?  Is it a day that ends with Y?  Dude, I've been happier here.  You know that.  When do you fight with your neighbors?  For what?  I know I have a reputation at all, but I've been happier here at XM. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  You know that.  I haven't broken many things.  I see they fixed the screen.  Thank you.  It's the neighbors upstairs.  This has been an ongoing thing.  They don't have a rug.  And this is another thing that drives a lot of people in New York City nuts.  And a lot of landlords and realtors will sell apartments with the fact that you have to  put a rug down.  A certain percentage of floor space has to be covered with a carpet.  Because a lot of these buildings, man, if they have the wood floors and they live right 
[00:28:00]  upstairs, you hear everything.  It's a nightmare.  So the people upstairs, the latest thing is, I don't know what is going on up there, but  they like to roll a ball or something.  Like a big ball all the way across their apartment.  And you know my apartment's kind of, you know, it's long in a way.  So they go from one room to another.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know if there's a pet up there.  But all you hear, rolling across the floor.  And then they walk to go get it.  And then they start over.  But I don't really, you know, you hear these noises from your neighbor.  And you're trying to figure out exactly what the F they're doing. 
[00:28:30]  And I can't figure this out.  All it is is a ball rolling across a long wooden floor and then steps to go get it.  You want to fire a round up there.  Like, what are they doing?  Yeah, maybe the guy's, like, practicing his putting.  So we have this, like, it's kind of like an arms race going on, you know.  You know, they do that.  So then I jump up out of my bed and slam the ceiling as hard as I can.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Oh, you're a ceiling banging guy?  Oh, that just makes for bad neighbors.  So then they're like.  And it never works.  The guy upstairs is never going, oh, I better be quiet. 
[00:29:00]  He's banging.  It's like, no, F you.  Now I'm going to do it twice as much.  God, you're right on top of this.  Because then they stop for a second.  They stop.  And now I'm thinking they're thinking I'm, like, hanging a picture or something.  Because it's still early.  But it's not early for us because we get up.  You know, I think this was about 9.30 last night.  So they stop.  Just like that, you hear nothing.  And then they go back to rolling the ball.  Like, oh, I don't know what that was.  He must have been hanging a picture.  And I'm like, no, I'm not hanging a picture.  Doo, doo, doo, doo.  And then I start cursing, like, knock the F off. 
[00:29:30]  I just start screaming, stop with the ball, right?  So then they get pissed, like you just said.  And they're like, slamming on the floor.  Yeah.  Because now I annoyed them.  Welcome to New York.  So then I'm like, fine.  Fine.  So I let it go.  And I get the last laugh.  You know, I brought this story up about a month and a half ago.  I get the last laugh.  I get up at 4 in the morning.  So these neighbors had a problem with my sound system a few times.  You know, I turn up a movie and they come down.  Dude, it's really loud, blah, blah, blah.  They get all pissed off. 
[00:30:00]  They come down?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't gone up yet.  I'm about to go up because I'm a tough guy.  I think by next week I'm going to have it where I'm going to go up there.  Don't make me come up there.  So I was going to throw in a movie like Braveheart or something this morning at 4 in the morning  and just crank up the volume while I got ready.  That would be a good choice.  But I didn't feel like being a complete dick.  So, you know, I turn on all the news stations.  I got winds in the bedroom.  I turn on whatever local news is.  I think it's usually Channel 7 at that hour. 
[00:30:30]  And, you know, I have news all over the place as I'm getting ready.  So I just cranked the volume on the TV as loud as I could, knowing it's going to leak through up to there.  I'm like, you want to play?  Fine.  You're going to lose because I get up earlier than you.  Something tells me you were cranking it loud before they were even making noise upstairs.  No, not really.  Were you a loud guy?  No, because, you know, when you just wake up, you don't want to hear loud.  Yeah.  You know, I have all my lights all just on dimmers, really soft because I'm still trying to wake up.  And I have, no, I have everything at normal volumes. 
[00:31:00]  So then I'm leaving the apartment, 445, you lose again.  And...  And you hear how annoying that is?  That's how long I did it this morning.  You hit their buzzer.  Dude, without a doubt.  Oh, that is cruel.  That is just cruel.  I always win in the end.  How are they going to beat that?  How are they going to beat that?  It was 4.55.  Hit that buzzer at 7.45 when you go to sleep. 
[00:31:30]  Well, they might not know it's me at that point.  I don't know.  Well, I think they know this time because the TV was really loud, too.  Yeah.  It was a double attack there.  But as annoying as that just sounded, that's what I did to them.  I mean, a nice, long...  There you go.  There you go.  You thought you were going to be tough, you know, pounding back on the floor.  I would wipe a little bit of dog crap on my own buzzer and then make noise.  So when you come out, after hearing the noise, to buzz my buzzer, you would get stink finger. 
[00:32:00]  That's the only defense I could think of.  I've never had a problem with my neighbors.  Ever?  No.  Never.  In three years, at least, that I've been in New York, I've had a problem.  Yeah, but they probably have carpets down on their floor.  Yeah, you're lucky.  A lot of places will make you throw the carpets down because this is a major problem in New York City.  It doesn't matter where you live.  In Brooklyn, we had fighters next door.  A couple that would just go at each other all the time. 
[00:32:30]  Yelling, screaming, the guy, like, throwing stuff.  I don't think he beat her or anything.  It was like one of those PSAs that are on TV about you should do something if you hear, you know,  because it's got the guy and he's hearing a fight going on and hearing some smacking and a woman screaming  and he just sits there and doesn't pick up the phone.  That's that PSA.  I'm that guy.  There could have been gunfire.  I could hear a scream.  Don't hit me!  Ah!  Ah, you bitch!  And I'm just like, I got my ear to the wall and I'm laughing. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh, he's really getting a, she must really have not have listened today.  And then when it gets really bad, you just turn the TV up louder.  That's it.  No, I turn the TV down.  Oh, the second we would hear like,  I would turn the volume down on the TV and we would both run to the wall, put our ears  to the wall, looking at each other.  Like, me and my girlfriend, like, have opposite ears to the wall so we're looking at each other 
[00:33:30]  and going, oh, this is a good one.  This is a good one.  I think he's going to hit her this time.  That's actually a law in New York about the carpet.  And there's nothing more enjoyable than having somebody call the police to come over and,  you know, bitch and complain about the neighbor's carpet.  And I think you're about two steps away from doing that.  Some of the...  Well, what happens if you show up, though, at someone's place?  Well, you show up and maybe you get a nice hint of scent of Java log or something like  that and they're bitching and complaining and you just kind of look at them like, 
[00:34:00]  you have nothing better to do with your time.  The only reason I pound on the ceiling and hit their buzzer, I'll be completely honest,  because I know I can take the guy.  Ah, there you go.  You always size up people and if you know you can take them, then you're a little tougher.  That's just human nature.  I know I can take him.  He's a foreign guy with a little faggoty girlfriend and I'd have no problem with this situation.  When I went on the ride-along with Keith, we got a call to go to this house where the guy  was upset that his...  Was it his housekeeper or somebody was flushing stuff down the toilet and clogging it? 
[00:34:30]  Remember that guy in the basement?  He was in the basement cleaning out.  He had buckets full of crap and toilet paper and cigarette butts that were in his trap for  his sewage.  And he calls up and goes, if this person does this again, I want them arrested.  And Keith's trying to say, this is a civil matter.  It has nothing to do with the cops.  We go out on other calls and the address comes in again.  The guy calls the cops again.  We go down there and Keith's like, I'm going to arrest you if you call us one more time. 
[00:35:00]  This is not a matter for the police.  People call the cops for...  Yeah, they will call for not enough carpeting on the person's upstairs apartment.  It's amazing what these idiots call for.  It is total horses.  And they think like you're going to go there and do something.  What am I going to do?  Yeah, they call for people hiding their wine on Christmas Eve, let's say.  And they call up and complain.  What happens if you got a call from someone and they said, look, I paid this girl to do 
[00:35:30]  something to me and I realized that she wasn't a girl halfway through it and she won't give  my money back.  Will the police help?  The only thing at that point I think I can offer is maybe a hug.  Consoling.  All right, we got to take a break.  We'll get the radio show started.  Yes, sir.  We have Colin Quinn coming in today and Keith Robinson and Ralphie Mays stopping by again.  Keith's not coming.  Oh, Keith.  He's got to get his son to school today.  That's too bad.  I want to say hi to Keith. 
[00:36:00]  And also...  High school.  What?  Why does it say on the...  Wow.  Why does it say on the guest sheet that Stalker Patty's coming in?  She never gave her gift to you.  I got the gift that I never gave to you.  This might be the wrong day to give me a gift.  Oh, boy.  This may be the wrong day.  Oh, boy.  This might be the wrong day.  Also, Steve made a new sweeper about Jim that's really good.  We should play that.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Where is it?  It's over the...  Where is it?  Oh, the handbook one?  Yeah.  That is really funny.  We'll play that when we get back, but Anthony was talking about the abuse PSAs and stuff, 
[00:36:30]  so why don't we play the famous restaurant one here?  I love this one.  A Canadian PSA...  Never aired.  They deemed it too violent.  This guy's sitting in a restaurant with his kids, and the waitress comes over to pour some coffee.  She spills it, and the guy overreacts a bit.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  How do you like this? 
[00:37:00]  Stop it!  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony...  Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not.  You're sightless taut.

[00:38:30]  The passion will be renewed this February as spring training opens for the 2005 season.  The hopes and dreams of 30 major league teams are told on XM satellite radio like never before.  XM counts down to spring training with some of the greatest play-by-play calls of all time.  Like this one.  On August 7th, 1999, Paul Olden describes the action as Wade Boggs reaches a milestone in dramatic fashion. 
[00:39:00]  A hit that makes history.  3,000 base hits for Wade Boggs.  And he hits a home run to Lewis.  I'm Bob Edwards, inviting you to hear your hometown team wherever you are  on XM Satellite Radio, the official satellite radio network.  of Major League Baseball.  Ian Anthony, XM 202.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:39:30]  Wow, a lot of instant feedback coming in from our little discussion on home decor.  Who is today's guest?  Christopher Lowell. 
[00:40:00]  Great show.  Great way to keep the gay out.  Does Opie's doorman make sure that the hallways are cleared before he enters the building?  No eye contact, no good morning neighbor.  Sounds like Opie found the perfect place to live.  Big time celebrities.  Wait, I've been listening to the wrong channel for the past three months.  And Jimmy has rocks at his place on the floor, so it's easy to reach when he smashes some 
[00:40:30]  whore in the face.  Also on the instant feedback, it's Jess Fowl from D.C. checking in.  He writes,  Badass, Opie, bullying someone smaller.  You know, that's just honesty.  That is just honesty in human nature.  People will size up the person that they're pissed off with, and if they know they can  take him, then they're a little tougher.  That's the reality of it.  It's not bullying if they're bigger than you.  I was just going to say that, yeah.  It's amazing and heroic.  And dumb.  And stupid. 
[00:41:00]  Incredibly stupid.  Most people get a lot tougher when they think they can take the person.  That's just human nature.  I mean, when you have road rage, and you see some kind of soccer mom in a minivan, you're  pretty damn tough on the highway, aren't you?  You're cutting her off, you're jamming on your brakes, you're beeping your horn, you're  giving her your finger.  But if it's a bunch of black dudes from Compton that have rap music cranking, are you doing  the same thing?  Are you doing the same thing?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, right.  Under my breath.  Not looking. 
[00:41:30]  Besides, if they're from Compton, they probably wouldn't be driving here.  Well, yeah, but it's a national show, so I'm trying to...  All of a sudden, wow, hey, they're broadcasting from L.A. somewhere.  See, I'm smart.  But you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's how it is.  Yes, it is.  You want me to act like, oh, no, you know, I take on all comers, man.  The bigger, the better.  Yeah, if you're 6'4", 300, I'm not scared of you.  The reality is, you take on people you know you can take.  It's just how much smaller than you they are that makes you a pussy. 
[00:42:00]  If it's pretty evenly matched, then you're, you know, you're not a pussy or anything, or  a bully.  If he's slightly weaker, that's a great advantage for you, and you'll probably do some damage.  But if they're really pathetically geeky, weak, and, you know, a lot smaller than you,  then, I don't know.  And a wheelchair.  You know, a great example.  It's a story that...  Maybe you should walk away from the situation.  A great example comes up on the show from time to time.  And, you know, the time I hit that dude when we were driving, home from work, okay, Anthony 
[00:42:30]  and I used to have road rage like no one's business, especially Anthony.  I mean, he was ridiculous.  I've seen you.  Uh-huh.  You know, you do get tougher depending on who's pissing you off.  I'm so much more relaxed now.  And so, when I hit the guy in the crosswalk with my car, he turned out to be a big, tough  mother effer.  Yeah, he was a tough guy.  And when he took out my, you know, side view mirror with one punch...  Emasculated you right then and there.  And it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't a small side view we've talked about. 
[00:43:00]  It's one of those very involved ones with the, you know, the cords and stuff.  Yeah.  As soon as he knocked that off my car with one punch, I'm like, hey, sorry, neighbor.  Okay, let me just...  You have a good day.  Hey, let me get out of your way.  But if it was like some fat bitch from, I don't know, Idaho or something that was in  Manhattan and she hit the side of my, you know, and she punched out my side view and  it was just a lucky shot.  Right.  Am I jumping out of the vehicle at that point? 
[00:43:30]  Of course I am.  Hey.  But Anthony and I couldn't get out of that situation fast enough.  We locked the doors.  We didn't make eye contact.  We're like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, please turn, you know, please get out of  my way so we can continue.  I don't like being hit.  It hurts.  That's another thing about getting...  Makes you feel funny.  That's another thing about getting older.  Yeah.  Getting hit in the face really does suck.  No, no.  When you're...  You know something?  Getting hit in the face is for your 20s.  That's for guys in their 20s.  The second you hit 30, it's no more getting hit in the face. 
[00:44:00]  And once you really get into the mid, late 30s, there should be no situation ever where  you are being hit in the face.  Because it, like I said, it does hurt and it makes you feel really funny right after it  happens.  You're all woozy.  Maybe...  Perhaps you fall down.  Yeah.  Hurting yourself even further.  Yeah.  Last time I got punched in the face, I was 19.  19?  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  The last time I was punched in the face, 15 years old.  15 years old.  I'd been in fights after that, but never got hit in the face again.  And this was, it was in California, I believe it was Compton.  And I was hanging...  No, it was California though.  San Juan Capistrano.  And this kid from school comes up to me and he starts like open-handed slap boxing a little  in front of the strip mall.  And I just, I'm not a fighter. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know technique or anything.  If I get into a fight, or when I used to get into the fights when I was a kid and never  really got into that many, it was always just about the dirtiest way to fight to end it  as quickly as possible.  I'm not a finesse guy that can outbox people, but I'll kick you in the balls, I'll gouge out  your eyes, just some way to end it.  So a slap boxing, you can't use that strategy because you don't know if it's serious or not.  What, you're pissed off and all of a sudden you guys go, all right, it's going to be a 
[00:45:30]  slap boxing fight?  No, he was just like, I didn't like him, he didn't like me, but we never fought.  And he just steps up, he's like, hey, Cumia, what's up, man?  And like takes a couple of these half-hearted swipes open-handed at me.  So I kind of put a block up and kind of, you know, I'm looking at what he's doing.  What are you doing, the rope-a-dope?  Rope-a-dope.  Yo, yo.  So he kind of sent my head back with this little right-hand slap, and when my head came back  forward, this left-hand full-fisted punch was waiting for me right in the eye. 
[00:46:00]  Down goes Cumia!  Down goes Cumia!  Someone stop the fight!  Down goes Cumia!  I was on my ass before I knew what happened, and I couldn't see out of that eye.  I can't see, goddammit!  And blood just gushing from my brow, like completely split my lid open.  And then him and his friends were like, laughing at me.  They could have just pulled my pants down and raped me. 
[00:46:30]  It was just totally emasculated.  Cumia Bombayé!  Yeah, and that was just, that was the last time I was hit in the face.  Hit in the head, man.  It's just awful getting hit in the face.  I got caught with a woman.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, I think you told the story once.  I'm telling you.  I'm not, maybe way in the beginning.  We have a whole new audience now.  What happened?  I was 19. 
[00:47:00]  This is a great story.  Figures, too.  Of course you were caught with a woman, you horny little bastard.  Well, I was seeing this one casually.  We never actually had sex.  I think maybe once for a couple seconds, but maybe not even.  And she was separated from a guy.  They were married.  And all she would tell me about this guy was what I'm like.  He lived with a girlfriend, though.  And all she would say is what a maniac he was and how he used to like to fight cops.  But like, he was like a true psycho.  He was what Ope was just talking about. 
[00:47:30]  He was the type of guy that the bigger you are, the more likely he was to try to punch you in the face.  Like, if five cops jumped on him, he was really ready to fight.  Right.  He was like an animal.  Yeah, there are guys like that out there, I understand.  That just, that don't want a way out.  They want to.  Yeah, but in general, most people.  Hazer and a Billy Club.  Yeah.  But most people just will size up.  Most people, yeah.  They're weaker, but there are those guys out there that will take on anybody.  I understand that.  She lived over like a pub.  So one night we were laying there on the couch just kissing.  And we weren't doing anything sexual, really. 
[00:48:00]  And I hear the sound of like, let me see.  Which I think, I hear this knock on the wood.  And I'm like, is somebody downstairs taking a broom handle and knocking the ceiling?  I'm like, what is that about?  Maybe Opie's down there.  Yes, exactly.  Maybe there's a man laying rocks who doesn't approve of the loud smacking of our lips.  The loud smooching.  And then I'm laying down.  All that's on is the light of the TV.  And I hear her go, oh my God.  Oh my God.  No way.  Oh, that's not good. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, and you're thinking, hmm, let me turn around.  I hope the prize patrol's there with a big million dollar check.  I'm not thinking anything.  I felt two hands on my back.  Oh, no.  And I saw white.  I never saw it.  I just saw white.  I got punched in the face so fast and so hard twice.  I saw stars.  Twice?  Dude.  Dung, dung.  It was, I didn't, I just felt hands, stars.  And the next thing I know, he's flipping the lights on.  And I'm sitting on the floor. 
[00:49:00]  One of my contact lenses was out.  My mouth is all swollen up.  And he is standing up.  He was about six foot.  And he's breathing heavy.  And he's telling his wife that he went out and did cocaine.  And he's like, oh, man.  He's like, and I'm going to kill him.  You know I'm going to kill him, don't you?  And he's referring to me as if I'm not there, like I'm a real old person.  You're dead already.  Oh, dude, it was.  You couldn't, there was no way to run out of the place?  Second floor.  They lived on the second floor.  He was blocking the door.  Oh, my God.  You are done. 
[00:49:30]  I just sat there.  I'm like, uh.  You've got to go for the window.  And I didn't make the association.  I had met him before at another place and never made the association.  Yeah.  He was married, you know, whatever.  He was living with another girl.  He just freaked out one night.  Yeah, bring that up to him.  I almost said, you know, technically.  Good thing you didn't come in last night.  Elbow to the ribs.  But he was actually one of those guys that because I just kind of sat there, she mellowed him out.  She told me like the next day, she said, the only reason he didn't like kill you  or throw you through the window is because you sat there and you were kind of small. 
[00:50:00]  You were submissive.  He was just the opposite of, oh, like I sat there and I had no, he didn't, so he's like  he couldn't just attack me sitting there.  Wow.  And he walks through the door and he goes, he mellowed out.  And he's like, look, I know you know she was my wife.  Just tell me you knew she was my wife and I'll let you go.  If you don't tell me that.  Oh, that sounds like a setup.  If you don't tell me, I'm going to kill you.  Oh, that's a setup.  What do you do?  I said, well, you're going to have to kill me because I didn't know. 
[00:50:30]  Did you know though?  No.  Well, I had, I knew, like when I met him, I didn't, but then I had seen his face like  later and I made the, like, oh, okay.  But when I met him, I hadn't.  But I did like, you know what I mean?  I could, should have said yes, technically, but then he opened the door.  Don't insult my intelligence.  Just tell me you were the one that fingered Sonny.  That's the same gag he's playing on you.  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was, it was Pazzini.  It was Pazzini.  And, uh, good.  Get out of my sight. 
[00:51:00]  So I wound up walking out and I, I, I got in a car and, uh.  Big fat guy behind you.  Clemen just said, hello.  Hello, Jim.  Went through the windshield and we drove off.  And I made the little, my feet made the squeaky sound on the window.  As I was being strangled.  No, I just drove home and everybody at work the next day is like, what, did you get punched  in the face?  And I'm like, my dad even asked me.  No, I fell on the treadmill.  I fell on a, it happened to have a class ring on it.  I think we have audio of you after you got punched in the face.  Oh.  Wow, that is really annoying. 
[00:51:30]  You're not being fair.  You're not being fair. 
[00:52:00]  You're not being fair.  Oh, exactly.  Oh, exactly.  Wow.  Yeah.  He punched you twice in the head and then let you go.  Dude, I never saw it coming.  I never saw his face until I was on the floor looking up in the lights. 
[00:52:30]  That was what was so scary.  It's like, because there was no lights on, just the TV.  And I went from one reality to the other.  Like, I just, it was.  Instant.  Yeah.  I'm actually probably in hindsight glad I didn't see him coming.  Because I was 19.  I wasn't a tough guy, but I would have at least, you know, when there's a larger man coming out, you can't just sit there.  You have to at least stand up.  Try to defend yourself.  And that would have been, he probably would have picked up a TV and cracked it over my face.  Because he was.  And well, he should have.  A psycho.  Yeah.  Adulterer.  No, he was, you know, I should have pointed out that, look, technically, sir, you are involved in another relationship.  And she's moved on, but I felt it was. 
[00:53:00]  How about I come over when you're having sex, sir, and punch you in the face?  That's right.  Some girl that isn't your wife.  I know.  Let's go to Barney.  Hey, Barney.  Hey, how's it going today?  I don't know.  We're kind of just goofing off, it looks like.  All right, Barney.  Barney.  You can continue at any time, sir.  Go ahead.  Hey, I was just, just the other day, I don't get to listen to it very often in the morning, but I have XM and I got to listen to the replays.  And Jim was talking about the sensitivity training, and I damn near wrecked my truck when he says the only kind of sensitivity training I want is I pull my pants down, have my sack hanging out, and someone tickles it, and I go, ooh, that's sensitive. 
[00:53:30]  Well, thank you, Barney.  Appreciate it.  Always got to have this loaded.  I don't know why I don't like this.  Yeah, yeah, what, unfortunately we are.  We missed the last part.  What was the last part of it that you liked, that your phone cut out?  When Jim said he would just pull his pants down and have his sack hanging out, and someone would tickle it, and he would go, ooh, that's sensitive. 
[00:54:00]  Wait, Barney?  Barney?  Yeah.  Your cell phone crapped out.  What was that last part again?  The last part.  The last part is when Jim says he pulls his pants down and he has his sack hanging out.  Barney, you there?  Yeah.  Barney.  Barney.  You guys can hear me?  No.  I got him now.  The part was about.  We heard something about sensitivity.  Sensitivity training.  Can you hear me now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Now you're fine.  Now it seems pretty good.  All right.  Well, I'm on my way to work.  But, hey, I just said when Jim said the sensitivity training, when he, uh, any kind of sensitivity  training he wants is he'll pull his pants down, his sack will be hanging out, and someone  will tickle it.  Barney.  All right.  We'll see you guys.  Goddamn.  Barney, hold it.  I hear you now.  Fine.  You crackled right when you said sensitivity training.  Okay.  One more time.  Sorry.  That's okay.  Okay.  I just said, uh, when Jim was saying about the sensitivity training. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about that the other day.  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing was a goof.  Which, which, which, which line did you like?  Because the whole thing turned out to be a goof.  That was the one where you said the only kind of training that you wanted, you would  pull your pants down, have your sack hanging out, and someone would tickle it.  The what?  I would, who would tickle what?  Your sack.  The sack of what?  His, um.  Your balls.  Oh, the ball sack?  Yeah.  Well, I didn't. 
[00:55:30]  We heard you every time, stupid.  You see how, how bummed he got the more he had to repeat it?  Like, he's even hearing, oh, this sucks. 
[00:56:00]  I, uh, just was Jim's.  This story stinks.  Yeah.  Well, what I said was, oh.  Speaking of the sensitivity training, Steve, uh, put this together.  Life in corporate America can be a grind.  All they do is they remove the humor from everything.  Uh, and you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem.  I'm standing here with this direction feeling silly.  You're gonna need some sound advice.  Talk less and suck more.

On the instant feedback, Chris from Boston.  Hey, Ope, speaking of PSAs in the Herald this morning, some guy threw scalding hot coffee in a meter maid's face when she wrote a ticket for his Hummer. 
[01:00:00]  He double parked while he was in Starbucks and his girlfriend was sitting in the passenger seat.  Starbucks!  Starbucks has to be the biggest reason for parking tickets ever.  I know I've gotten a few.  There's a Starbucks in Brooklyn on a third, I believe, where I used to just pull up.  You pull up in front of Starbucks, and the whole front of Starbucks is a bus stop. 
[01:00:30]  So you pull in there.  You run in.  And for the couple of minutes it takes you to get your cup of coffee in there, you come out.  But it's a $110 ticket.  $110 cup of coffee.  Great.  I know we probably have some fans that are, you know, meter maids.  I hate you all.  Yep.  Screw them.  I think you're a bunch of losers that couldn't get into the NYPD.  Cop wannabes.  Cop wannabes.  I've seen crap in my neighborhood that just makes me sick. 
[01:01:00]  They literally will stand at meters and wait for it to be expired so they can write up the tickets.  And I've seen women and women with, like, kids running down the sidewalk because they can't afford a hundred.  It's like, what, a $110 ticket now?  How much is a meter?  The price tickets are ridiculous.  The cheapest one you're ever going to get now is, like, $55.  It used to be $55 when a meter ran out.  But they hiked the prices in New York big time.  Bloom-effing-berg.  In Manhattan, you're $110.  It's $110.  For a meter.  For a meter violation. 
[01:01:30]  Okay?  $110.  $110.  And it's such a business.  It's just a business.  It has nothing to do with public safety and any of that crap.  It's just all about, you know, catching people with expired meters and writing them the tickets for $110.  I've seen ladies with kids running toward their car because they know it's close.  And there's the guy, stone-faced.  Because he's such a – speaking of tough guys, he's such a tough guy.  Like, just writing up the ticket right in front of the lady and her kid.  And she'll sit there begging, you know, because you can tell the lady can't really afford a $110 hit like that. 
[01:02:00]  They don't want to hear it.  They don't want to hear it.  They just look off.  They nod.  Write the ticket.  Hand it to you.  I hate the meter maids.  You know what you've got to do, though?  Take your coffee and splash it right in her face.  Right.  You still get the ticket, but that's got to feel good.  What are you thinking when you drive away and you have no coffee and you're like, not only do I have no coffee and a $150 ticket, but now I'm going to jail.  I'm absolutely getting arrested for this.  I've just splashed coffee in the face of a meter maid. 
[01:02:30]  All you can do, I guess, is drive around and hope you catch some Asian terrorists to kind of smooth the whole thing over.  Call Ben.  You know what?  Fair is fair, though.  I'm reading the story about the meter maid, okay?  A hulking Boston bodyguard was arrested yesterday, accused of hurling a scalding Starbucks coffee at a meter maid who slapped a ticket on his illegally parked Hummer in the back bay, Anthony.  We've been in the back bay many times in Boston.  Well, there you go.  There's a big, huge guy that knew he could handle the meter maid. 
[01:03:00]  I'm sure the meter maid is a lady.  The alleged attack unfolded about 8.30 a.m. when Christy Noviello, 44, was walking her Berkeley and Boylan Street's beat and saw the black Hummer parked in a loading zone with a woman in the passenger seat.  Now I might have to be on the meter maid's side.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  I'm a nice meter maid, Noviello told the Herald yesterday in an exclusive interview.  As a courtesy, and this never happens in New York.  This is the difference.  They don't give you any courtesy in New York because it's all about giving tickets, and I'm sure they get a percentage of the amount of money they collect, I'm assuming. 
[01:03:30]  No?  No.  So then why don't these meter maids give anyone a break in New York City, then?  I've never seen anyone get a break from a meter maid.  Piece of shit.  There's quotas, I think, right?  All right, well, that's what I thought, but Keith's saying no?  No, they don't get money from it.  They don't get a kickback off of every ticket they ride, but I believe there's quotas that they have to hit in order to keep their job.  It's such a big business in New York City.  I mean, in my neighborhood, there's literally a meter maid for every block of the city. 
[01:04:00]  It's crazy.  And they just circle the block all day long, just waiting for meters to expire.  Anyway, this lady, the meter maid, she says, as a courtesy, I gave the lady a chance to move because, you know, the dude's girlfriend or whatever was in the passenger seat.  So as a courtesy, I gave the lady a chance to move, but she pointed at the Starbucks and refused.  Yeah, I'm all for the meter maid on this one.  I have to take it back.  You know, I assumed, you know, oh, here's an opportunity, ran right up there and gave a ticket, but she gave him the courtesy, like, look, you know, I'm going to give you a ticket unless you move this Humvee. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe the guy told her, bitch, you don't ever move my Humvee, you know?  He spilled his coffee.  Well, she wrote up, in Boston, it's $55, Anthony.  Well, this was double parking.  This was a little different.  And he started yelling, I don't accept this ticket.  I don't accept this ticket.  He had a venti-sized cup of black coffee, oh, man, in his hand.  And Starbucks coffee's getting overly hot these days, getting close to the McDonald's hot.  And he flung it right in my face. 
[01:05:00]  Nice.  I went down, I was panicking, it hurt so bad I thought my face was falling off.  First and second degree burns on her face.  It was in my eyes, I was screaming.  Keep reading, he's a lovely Lebanese gentleman who owns a security firm, and you can bet she's going to sue and hopefully get a nice skitter.  Lebanese guy?  Yeah.  He probably got a sweet face and everything.  He looks so cozy.  So, that's what's going on in Boston today. 
[01:05:30]  That's one of the top stories in Boston.  That's front page.  That's front page stuff for Boston.  That's front page stuff.  What about the search for the terrorists up there and the dirty bomb?  I thought that would still be on the front page of the Boston papers.  Old news now.  Old news?  That was yesterday's news, how they panic everybody.  Oh, there's a dirty bomb on its way up to Boston.  That's what I love about the newspapers.  If you pay close attention to the front, I'm obsessed with the front pages of newspapers because it's so funny what we find important in this country. 
[01:06:00]  Boston yesterday, the whole city in a panic, Mayor Menino doing press conferences, there's a dirty bomb.  Oh, the governor didn't go to the inauguration because he had to stay in Massachusetts to make sure everybody was safe.  We've got to find the Chinese nationals that are possibly in Boston with their dirty bomb or what have you.  And then the next day, it's about this lady that has a cup of black coffee thrown in her face.  Meter Maid got a little burnt.  Don't you think if you live in Boston, you'd want the follow-up?  Uh-huh.  The follow-up was probably on page 37 or something. 
[01:06:30]  Nothing, you know?  Nothing.  That's how we are.  Dirty bomb one day, Meter Maid gets some coffee in her face.  There you have it.  Let's go to Peter on Long Island.  Peter, what's up?  You guys are getting weak.  You should have made that guy repeat that story 30, 40 times for Jimmy.  Peter.  Listen, Anthony, you've got two words for you.  Kitty Genovese?  Yeah.  Remember when she was murdered in the street by somebody not calling the cops?  That's true.  Okay, one last one.  Here's the reason why I called. 
[01:07:00]  I'm at a movie, and I'm sitting next to about an 18-year-old kid, and the entire movie, he's picking his nose and eating it with the same finger.  Ooh.  And he's sharing an armrest with me.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, you know, I'm a little bit germaphobe, not much.  And I say to him, under my breath, I'm saying, it's enough already.  And he's ignoring me.  It's going on for an hour and a half.  And I keep saying, are you done yet?  You know, I can't believe it.  Enough already.  Finally, at the end of the movie, he says to me, shut the fuck up. 
[01:07:30]  I said, stop picking your nose and eating it.  I'm going to throw up in the movie theater.  Yeah.  You know what?  I gave up on going to the movies.  An hour and a half.  Stop.  Solid.  What finally happened?  The movie was over, but I hinted to the guy every time I looked over, he was doing that one finger, like the pinky into the mouth, the pinky into the mouth.  I was a little jealous because I was hungry, but it was just too much.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  It never ended for the entire movie.  At one point, my kid thought I was going to fight the guy.  But it was like, you know, he was younger than me. 
[01:08:00]  I could have probably taken him.  That's why I picked on him.  People are too inconsiderate in this day and age to sit with in a room and watch a movie with.  Like I was about to say, I gave up going to the movies on weekends during the prime time anyway.  Don't bother.  I mean, we're lucky enough we had these hours.  I go see my movies Tuesday around noon.  There's no one there.  All the kids with their cell phones are in school.  When I watch a movie, I want it to be a nice environment like it is in my living room.  Just sitting, watching a movie. 
[01:08:30]  And you can't do it anymore because people are just inconsiderate, self-centered jackasses.  Anthony, what would you have done sharing an armrest with him?  I wouldn't have.  I would have moved.  I would have gotten up and moved.  He was doing both hands.  He was a switch hitter.  You know what?  Never ended.  Maybe that boy didn't have money for snacks, sir.  Should have bought him some popcorn.  That's right.  Or shared yours with him.  Oh, yeah.  Here, get a good handful with your booger fingers.  Thank you, Peter.  Maybe I should have given him a Purell.  All right.  Thanks, Peter.  Take it easy.  Good job.  Peter from Long Island. 
[01:09:00]  Peter.  Yeah.  I was going to hear you.  A little suggestion to the movie industry.  Yeah.  They should, you know, these new releases, you know, what have you.  They should make them available on pay-per-view immediately.  Ooh.  And charge, you know, maybe.  Movie prices?  Or double the movie prices.  Ooh.  Just as a luxury for people that just have had it with these animals in the movie theaters.  And you really want to go and see some of these new releases, but you just can't sit  through the crap.  I think because then you're not getting the money that you would get if five people are 
[01:09:30]  watching the movie in your house.  Yes.  Ah, that's a lot of money.  Well, then, you know, hike it up to, I don't know, 50 bucks.  Or ask people.  And then get a few of your friends, like, hey, let's all chip in and watch whatever the  latest movie is out there, you know?  People would burn it on this DVD and they'd watch.  Or you could just ask them, look, just please pay $7 to every person.  Ask them to be honest.  The honor system.  Yeah, that'll happen.  There you go, the honor system.  Eric, what are you doing?  Who's this?  Rob from Long Island.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey. 
[01:10:00]  How you doing, Golden Buns?  I'm good, thank you.  How are you?  No problem.  Yeah, for a second, it took me a while to realize this was a live show today.  All I'm hearing is the same old stories.  I'm hearing Opie telling a story about his rear view mirror getting knocked off.  I'm hearing...  Well, I set that up by saying, you know, this is a story that we, you know, refer to a lot.  And it was tied into bullying.  It was tied into bullying and how we always size up the person we want to, you know, confront  and see if we can take them.  That's all.  What's wrong with you, Rob?  That's all I got. 
[01:10:30]  Rob, we will give you seven cents of entertainment today.  I guarantee it.  Best of?  Mention one thing.  Mark...  What a dick bag.  Why don't you shove it out your ass?  What an idiot.  Don't make us talk about American Idol for the next hour and a half.  What are you...  Don't you make us go there.  Don't.  What an...  What a complete ass.  Go ahead, Mark.  Turn it off then.  Mark...  Yeah, I just want to tell you about Meter Maze.  I hear with the meters, but for people at Double Park, they should run a $500 ticket, never 
[01:11:00]  give them a chance to move the friggin' car.  That's the most annoying thing.  I had to drive down Coma Avenue in Boston every day for work.  And the whole right lane is just stopped.  Like, when...  It's just the most friggin' annoying thing in the world, and I wish Meter Maze it right  with $500 tickets and stand outside that Starbucks.  I'm with you, and they are doing a service at that point.  But to sit next to a Meter and wait for it to expire, and that car is really in no one's  way... 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, there are certain situations that...  There are some places you can double park, and some you can't.  When people double park in the right lane right at an intersection, where now people are waiting  to make a left turn, and now you can't get around them because someone's double parked  in the right lane, they should be just dragged out on the street like Reginald Denny, and 
[01:12:00]  just pummeled.  Pummeled.  I'll punch it out.  All right, very good.  Although, yeah, yeah, I don't know if violence is the answer.  No, it is.  Because he'll never do that again.  Good point.  I'm sure Reginald Denny will never stop in South Central again.  Not without his doors locked.  That's it.  Old toilet to the head Reggie.  Old porcelain skull.  Old watch me dance after I clock you with this thing.  And they hug each other at the trial.  What a disgrace.  Oh, I know.  Stupid white trucker.  Got his head kicked in on TV, and then he hugs the guy. 
[01:12:30]  Hugs him.  I'm sorry, my white face and head were intimidating, sir.  Didn't mean to enrage you.  Guilty idiot.  Excuse me.  Is this the way to, whoa, as he gets dragged out of his truck?  Roll the windows up and lock the doors, my friend.  Yeah, and then just drive over everybody.  Right.  Here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a girl.  Oh, a girl.  Sally.  Yes.  Hello.  You're kidding me.  Yes.  I was talking to, or I was thinking about Anthony yesterday, his little booger boyfriend. 
[01:13:00]  All right, hold on.  Hold on there, Sally.  Hold on.  We've got to talk amongst ourselves.  Is that short for Salvatore, maybe?  Because I know how they sometimes go, hey, Sally.  When she first started talking, I thought it was a guy, but now I think it's a girl.  It's definitely a girl.  Is it a girl?  Yeah, yeah, it is.  It's a girl.  There's something going on there.  Something weird with the voice, though, no?  With the voice.  Yeah.  It's deep.  Maybe she's a smoker.  Yes.  Sally?  I'm a girl with a low voice, yes.  Do you smoke?  You sound like you're a 16-year-old boy. 
[01:13:30]  It's like that in-between.  It's like, yeah, I know I'm a boy, but I'm going to be a man soon, and the voice is starting  to get deeper.  How many times have you called sir on the phone?  Not very often.  Usually just early in the morning when you just wake up, it's real low.  Anyway.  Now she's got your whiskers rubbing on the phone.  She's starting to sound more female now.  Yeah.  More womanly.  Go ahead, Sally.  Jesus.  You sound like Simon.  Now you sound nice.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Okay.  The kid, how do you know for sure that he wasn't flicking the boogers and not just wiping 
[01:14:00]  them?  Well, because the father saw him with his hand tucked between the cushions of the couch.  Because I was thinking you'd have to get a new rug, and the doorknobs and everything  have little snoties on them, too.  You might have to move.  No, no.  All the doorknobs were scrubbed with Lysol disinfectant.  Why are we still talking about the booger?  People are fascinated with the fact that there's a booger in my couch, and I now have to get  rid of it.  I don't know why.  And no, the booger wasn't flicked.  Don't get me more paranoid than I am already about kid snot around the house. 
[01:14:30]  Bye.  All right.  Thank you.  You should just blacklight your place to see what other problems you have.  What?  What?  All right.  His first miss.  It's his first miss ever.  That's Derek's first miss.  That was actually a great thought when we first started talking about it.  Right, right.  He can only be so quick, though, in that other room there.  You know what?  Yeah.  If that was right on the money, timing-wise, it might have worked.  Might have.  Yeah.  It's kind of a reach anyway. 
[01:15:00]  But late like that?  Oh, my friend.  Your first miss.  That's okay.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's nice to see he's fallible.  Here you go.  Pass it for you.  Pass it for you.  And all the other interns, because they're all so competitive.  They're all happy that Derek messed up.  He messed up on that one.  Thrilled.  Oh, good thing.  And Derek will try to impress us Monday.  He'll be coming in here in a three-piece suit to get back at our good graces.  Nathaniel was probably egging him on.  Yeah, dude, it's a good one.  I'm sure it's a great one.  But I don't know.  The moment's kind of passed. 
[01:15:30]  Dude, the moment's not passed.  No, it's perfect.  Trust me.  Trust me on this.  I know comedy.  Jim had me warm up for him once.  Trust me on this.  You'll get the credit.  Believe me, you know, Fan was egging that one on.  Oh, of course he was.  We have raised a bunch of asses around here.  Everyone came in here all nice and sweet and, you know?  Now they're all competitive.  And just asses.  Speaking of the booger, Anthony, this booger thing has taken on a life of its own.  Yes, much like it has at my house. 
[01:16:00]  And Peter wrote in.  Peter.  I'm writing this because I found it funny today how grossed out Anthony became  since a booger was wiped onto his couch.  Serical.  Let me introduce myself.  I'm Lieutenant Peter of FDNY EMS and presently assigned to the Rockaway Station.  Oh, and my hours are 6 a.m. till 2, so I feel for you guys,  except I live at exit 68 on the LIE, so my commute is just a little longer.  Sorry about that.  Any more info this guy can get?  Wow.  I have three kids.  I went to blah blah.  Anyway, allow me to share some stories with you. 
[01:16:30]  He laughed because you're so grossed out by the booger, right?  Yes.  I once treated a homeless guy on a Manhattan street.  His legs were very necrotic?  Necrotic.  Necrotic.  That's flesh that is dying on his legs.  Thank you, Anthony.  To the point, we had to cover the wounds before we transport him.  Reaching behind me to get my equipment while facing the patient,  I felt something that did not feel like my tech bag.  I looked around and noticed that I had put my thumb right through his leg.  That's story one. 
[01:17:00]  Another time, we were called to a patient on a Brooklyn street.  He was backing in a six-wheel truck.  The guy slipped and fell to the ground.  The truck was still moving.  The rear wheels ran over the calf of one of his legs,  tearing it from the leg.  Nice view of the bone, muscle, etc.  You know, I thought these aren't on my couch, so I don't care.  I'd like you to have some necrotic bum flesh on your stomach.  That would really make me happy.  Rotting bum flesh.  I want to talk about the extremely fat people. 
[01:17:30]  How about these people?  I've never heard of this.  How about these people that have yeast infections all over the skin  because of the amount of fat rolls?  Oh.  Well, any kind of pocket on your body can get yeast infection.  Really?  Yeah.  We once picked up a guy.  He was complaining that there was something wrong with his thing.  Uh-oh.  When I asked him what he meant, he felt it was best to show me.  Let me just show you what's down there.  So he pulled down his pants, and his junk was green. 
[01:18:00]  Green junk, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Was it envious?  And then he just goes on to say, thanks for the great radio.  I would just put a Heineken label on it.  Actually, paint the rest of you green and pretend you're a frog.  Actually, Enz is going, Anthony, just something to think about  while you're eating your banana in the morning.  Yeah, thanks.  Good thing I finished it.  Hey, I'm grossed out by a booger on my couch.  What can I tell you? 
[01:18:30]  Hey, here's another Jim Norton fan.  Let's go to Dave in Manhattan.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I got a little complaint about Jimmy.  What's the complaint, Dave?  All right, so here's the deal.  Jimmy, you're a stand-up.  You're great at it.  I think you're a funny guy, so I'm not calling up  questioning your ability to make people laugh.  Thank you.  You're really funny.  The thing is this.  You don't fit into the show, my man.  No?  The show is better without you.  Really?  What?  You kill the flow.  What's that?  You just ought to lay out a little bit, Jimmy.  You mean that, jerk? 
[01:19:00]  Hold on.  As soon as the sound clip is done, we'll let you finish.  What's that, buddy?  Go ahead.  All right, so I'm not questioning your ability to make people laugh.  You're just not a radio guy.  You don't fit into the show.  I think I fit in rather nicely.  Are you insane?  I'm not insane.  Do you listen to this show?  All the time.  Yeah?  I was listening to the best of weeks ago.  A lot of people really like Jimmy.  Everyone has their...  I just don't...  I think the show is better without him.  Everyone...  You know what, dude?  This is the beauty of it.  There's a part of me that's kind of glad you're calling, because now you're stuck with 
[01:19:30]  it.  I'm not going anywhere.  No, listen.  Right.  Let me finish.  Okay.  So, hopefully, there is a part of me that does hope that I ruin the show for you, because  every time you just start to enjoy their voices, I pipe in and spoil the whole thing  for you.  I'm not moving, bro.  Yeah, no.  Listen, I don't want you to move.  I just wish you'd lay out a little bit, Jimmy.  Lay out.  There is nobody that could sit here on this program, no guest we've ever had, that can  chime in during a conversation, and make me laugh my ass off at whatever comes out of  his disgusting mouth. 
[01:20:00]  I don't...  You make no sense.  This guy's called before.  You mean nobody?  And what he's trying to do...  No, I've never actually called before.  This is my first time.  What you're trying to do is this.  You're trying to set me up by being like, no, dude, I'm not trying to quit.  You're just trying to take another angle at it.  It's not going to work, dude.  I'm going to keep spoiling the show for you.  You don't have any range.  The other day, you're talking about the village.  Every three seconds, you're using the word atrocious.  Hold on.  No range whatsoever.  Hold on.  No range.  There's nothing to say about that movie other than it was atrocious.  Dave, saying the word... 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  Listen to the tape.  It was an atrocious film.  I'm not going to go into it and look for a thesaurus just to make you happy, because  you probably thought the village was brilliant, and you thought the twist was really cool.  Dave, here's the deal.  The whole village discussion was really, really good, so you just came up with a really  bad example if you're going to try to smash them.  Oh, well, Jimmy used the word a little too much for his liking.  I really enjoyed the whole village discussion.  You have no reason.  Did I use the word atrocious too much?  And I don't jump in too much, and that's just not accurate.  All right.  You should throw...  Well, let him fail.  Don't cut him off.  Don't cut him off.  No, no.  Thanks, Dave. 
[01:21:00]  I just hope you...  All right.  We got it.  We got you.  No, I'm going to keep talking, and I'm not going anywhere, so...  No, I think...  Sorry.  I think this is the best chemistry we've had on this radio program.  Of course.  And everyone out there has their faves.  I know there's a lot of people that hate me, some people that hate Norton.  Oh, there's a lot.  No one hates Anthony, because he's perfect.  I try so hard to be likable by everybody.  I know you do.  By everybody.  I try a little too hard sometimes.  I just didn't like...  He didn't really like it with the last call.  I didn't like his passive-aggressive behavior. 
[01:21:30]  I don't like passive-aggressive.  What can I say?  Anthony keeps everyone in the fold, doesn't he?  I keep all my options open.  You really do.  Now I'm going to step on you guys on purpose.  I apologize.  I'm a sneaky little worm.  I really want to spoil the show for this guy.  Good.  Anthony's just perfect.  That's right.  He's atrocious!  Everyone enjoys Anthony.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  I've got to plug something.  It's not for me, though.  I'm not involved with this.  I don't think.  It's a tsunami benefit.  I've got to plug. 
[01:22:00]  It's at the comic strip.  It's Tuesday, January 25th at 8 o'clock.  It's David Tell, Jim Gaffigan, Judy Gold, Florentine.  They're trying to get Colin for it.  And if I'm back in town from Washington, I'm going to do it.  I just don't know if I'm back from Washington yet.  But that's Tuesday the 25th, 8 o'clock, 212-861-9386.  Money's all going, obviously, for a tsunami benefit.  That's great.  I want to go to that.  You should.  It's a phenomenal lineup.  We should be back from Washington Tuesday.  I don't even think we're going to be going to Washington with the snowstorm coming in.  Okay.  Well, then that would be Tuesday, January 25th. 
[01:22:30]  If you don't come, you're atrocious.  All right.  Really fast, Anthony.  We're not going to spend too much time on American Idol today.  No.  I think we might have spent too much time on that yesterday or the day before or whatever.  But, you know, we try things.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Or sometimes we go a little too long.  Oh, were people complaining?  Some, yeah.  You know, they complain about everything.  Well, you know what is?  You guys don't have any range.  I mean, you just let the Idol thing go and go and go.  I think the show's atrocious.  It's atrocious.  There are times we purposely even punish our listeners, quite frankly. 
[01:23:00]  Deal with it.  We'll sit there and purposely punish you guys.  Purposely.  Purposely?  Did I say the word wrong?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  The triplets, Anthony, really fast because we missed them yesterday.  Yep.  Three sisters, triplets, all dressed the same.  Simon has taken some heat for this one.  Yeah, they're all over the news and those entertainment shows.  Yeah, because when they walked out, he told them they were overweight. 
[01:23:30]  And they're wearing these dresses that really showed that they were overweight.  That's the point, by the way.  Because, yeah, there are fat people and they go out there, sing their lungs out, and no  one cares that they're fat because they're not trying to present themselves as, quote,  a sex symbol or sex symbols or a Britney Spears wannabe or a Jessica Simpson type of, you  know, these triplets came out looking like Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, but the fat  versions.  Yeah, that's what he said, too.  That's what Simon said.  Right.  It was a perfect, you know, I agreed with him on this one. 
[01:24:00]  Yep.  And now people are like, oh, you shouldn't criticize their looks.  And I love girls that just are, they just cannot believe you call them fat.  Not because they're, you shouldn't say that.  They truly think in their minds they're thin.  Yeah.  Girls don't like hearing that.  I'm breaking some new ground here.  Girls don't like hearing that they're fat.  So they never hear it.  Guys are so conditioned to not tell girls that they are fat, overweight, chunky, nothing. 
[01:24:30]  That, I think they get delusional and don't know it because no one's telling them.  And then if someone does tell them, it's, you know, oh, screw you.  No, I'm not.  You shouldn't say that.  Right.  So we don't.  We're pussies, a bunch of guys.  We wouldn't say anything.  Real fast, I see the look on Jimmy's face.  He needs a little love here.  Why are we being, why are we being.  Hold on.  You need a little love here.  Tom in Allentown.  Go ahead.  What's that?  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Hi, Tom.  Make it fast.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[01:25:00]  I just wanted to give you some kudos.  You're getting beat up way too much today.  Well, that's, how am I getting beat up?  One guy?  Well, you know what I mean.  No, it's fine.  I just want to give you, I wanted to call earlier a couple days ago when you were talking  to Al Franken.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah, we're right here, dude.  No, we're not anymore.  Freak show the trucker real fast.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, you know, the show wouldn't be the same without you.  We're all glad you're here.  Oh, dude, thank you.  You don't, you never, I appreciate it, but you don't have to say that.  It doesn't affect me at all. 
[01:25:30]  You just look like you need a little love.  No, I really don't.  And it's here all the time.  David from Orlando, because I purposely try to get under your skin.  Go ahead, David.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy's great on the show, and his range is even better.  He likes men.  He likes women.  He likes tranny.  I don't like men, sir, but a tranny every once in a while is only a good gentleman's  fault.  See, that guy says tranny, too.  You guys made fun of me.  It's easier to say it that way.  Tranny.  Tranny.  Maggie from Syracuse.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say, I listened to you before Norton joined the show, and I listen now, 
[01:26:00]  and he does bring a lot to the show.  He's fucking hysterical.  Thank you, Maggie.  See, I mean, you know, everyone has their favorites.  After the break, you can kiss my ass, please.  Thanks, Maggie.  That was nice.  Anyway, so the triplets, Anthony.  Yes, so they step out, and Simon says they're fat, and then they sing.  Their singing wasn't bad.  They had three-part harmony, and I guess if you grow up together and you do sing, you  could work that out.  But the trouble is, what are you going to do?  Only one of them can move on. 
[01:26:30]  They're doing these three-part harmony songs.  Only one can move ahead.  Oh, is that the deal?  They would have to compete against each other, not with each other.  All three would make it, and then they can't compete as a group?  No.  So why the hell were they out there?  They were out there just so they could make fun of them.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Let's go to the audio.  Reality check here.  That's the truth.  He called us fat.  I don't even care that he didn't make it, because I know I have the talent, but I don't  want him on TV.  Is that out of order? 
[01:27:00]  This is how they gave it to me.  See, the first track should be him calling them fat, not the girls reacting to being  called fat.  Oh, brother.  For some reason, they don't, I don't know.  They don't put him in chronological order?  Well, I think they might not even have Simon's comments.  The message that Simon is sending to girls is such an unrealistic view, and I want all  those girls out there to know that we're confident, and whatever Simon said to us, it's not the  truth, and that's what matters. 
[01:27:30]  What matters is what you think about yourself.  No, it is the truth.  You are overweight for a pop star, blonde girl, blonde white girl pop star, because a black  woman that's fat is a diva like that, and you can say, you know, I don't know, you're  a diva.  Steve, what's going on with these clips?  A guy, it doesn't matter.  Nobody would mind, by the way, if he complimented on her appearance and said, wow, you have  the great look.  She wouldn't have minded then, but because it's naked, people only want to hear positive 
[01:28:00]  about themselves.  They don't want to hear the truth, only if it's a positive truth.  So what?  Hey, sorry, fatso, nobody wants to pay and see you because you're atrocious.  Steve, where's Simon?  All day, I'm going to say that now, you douchebag.  Where's Simon?  It's either four or five.  I apologize.  I think what happened was when I burned him to disc, it lined him up alphabetically.  Oh, that doesn't work.  Is that why your jacket is half the length of your shirt?  Yeah, I know.  Jesus, that stinks.  I know, doesn't it?  I was cold as hell.  I was just reaching for something warm. 
[01:28:30]  I don't like your collared vest.  It's really annoying me.  Do you trim your eyebrows on the side?  No.  Oh.  Why?  Is that something new?  Yeah, there's something going on there.  No.  You don't cut them over here?  No, not at all.  All right.  Do you trim them in the middle?  Actually, they should be growing into my friggin' hairline.  Do you trim them in the middle or up top?  Yeah.  Of course he does.  Yeah.  Or else I'd have the unibrow.  Yeah, he's Lebanese.  He would have that unibrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I absolutely trim this part in here.  Like, tweeze it with...  Sometimes you tweeze it just to make sure it doesn't grow back. 
[01:29:00]  You're a weird guy, Steve.  Thank you.  And that's coming from...  Yeah, that's coming from you, so I must be uber weird.  All right.  We're trying to find the Simon comment about the triplet.  I think there is something to be said as you as a group.  You're all overweight.  Oh, come on.  You all look like three overweight Jessica Simpsons.  Oh, come on.  We were expecting either you sound great or you suck, but we didn't expect to hear overweight. 
[01:29:30]  Why didn't you expect it?  Didn't expect to hear overweight.  They are.  They're at least 20 to 25 pounds overweight.  If you're going in to be a pop star, and you're a girl like that, and you're dressing like that,  you've got to take the criticism.  They were going for a certain look.  They were going for that pop star, blonde, bimbo look.  And if you're too overweight for that look, and he points it out, where's the problem?  I think that even if you're not going for that look, even if you're just walking down the street, 
[01:30:00]  if you're fat like that, somebody should be able to come up and go,  you're overweight, and you should hang your fat head and go do something about it,  because you're bothering everybody.  Fatso.  Really?  You actually believe that?  Absolutely.  And if somebody strikes you or throws hot coffee, that meter made,  the only reason the cop should arrest that guy is because she was slender and attractive.  That's the only reason.  All right.  I heard it put that way.  Yeah, all right.  So there you have it.  That's the latest on the American Idol. 
[01:30:30]  That's all we're going to spend on it.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the controversy that hit yesterday.  Fat chicks.  If they came in dressed pretty conservatively,  I don't think he would have mentioned their weight at all.  You know?  Right.  But they're presenting themselves as pop stars, like Jessica Simpson, who, you know.  What's that line from, but we have to curse to say it, from our pal,  the redhead comic that used to tour with Kinnison?  Uh-oh.  Jimmy Schubert.  You didn't think I was going to get it? 
[01:31:00]  Schubert.  No, I didn't.  He says you shouldn't honk your car if...  No, wait.  Shouldn't honk your car?  No, no, no.  Shh.  I just blew it.  Oh, my God.  Wait, no, no.  Here's a funny line.  Come on.  Honk your car.  You shouldn't drive your car into a pole.  If you drive a crappy car, you shouldn't.  You don't toot your own horn if you drive a crappy car or something?  There you go.  Is that it?  Boy, a Schubert classic, that was. 
[01:31:30]  Bird in the feathers, too, in a grove of something.  I've had so much coffee, I can't keep up with my freaking mouth.  Well, it's something about cars and...  If you're as big as a car, don't toot your own horn.  Yeah, it's something about cars and honking the horn.  Right.  All right.  Something about maybe this.  If you drive a crappy car, don't honk your horn and draw attention to yourself along those lines? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Perhaps with a humorous twist.  One point.  Somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Wonderful.  We've got to go to the phones real fast and change the subject, hopefully.  Bubba, what's up?  Hi.  What's going on, O&A?  Good morning.  Pregnant, bitch.  Hi, Bubba.  I'm in Dallas, Texas, 105.3.  The Talk That Rocks, Texas.  We've got Howard Stern on in the morning.  All right.  Yes.  Pugs and Kelly, Russ Martin, all that all day long.  Good friends. 
[01:32:30]  We're trying to figure out who is going to replace Howard Stern in the morning.  Yeah.  And Russ Martin mentioned you guys is replacing Howard Stern.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Russ Martin is a douchebag.  Well, I don't like Russ Martin.  I don't like Tom Likas.  They're both on that program.  Yeah, I don't know what they're doing with that station down there, because Russ Martin  is awful, and Tom Likas is absolutely awful.  But Pugs and Kelly, we love.  Yeah, we like the Pugs and Kelly, and obviously Howard does a good job, but those other two  guys are awful.  Have you seen their intern, Sybil?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, I love Sybil.  She's a 10, man.  This girl is so hot.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I fooled around with her once.  What?  I just wanted to say that.  All right.  I just wanted to say that.  Get out of here.  Not here, man.  A little mashup here.  The hives and prodigy getting together.  We'll be right back.

[01:39:00]  Dude, I was just kidding about kissing my butt.  And I don't deserve it after that faux pas before the break.  Chris from Long Island.  He writes, wants to kiss Opie's butt.  Let's go to Shannon in Toronto.  I think Shannon is a fan of Jim Norton, if I remember correctly. 
[01:39:30]  Shannon?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just want to talk about three quick things, if I could.  The first thing is, Jimmy, I thought about it all last night, what are Canadians good for?  And Canadians are good for beating the living shit out of waitresses that can't serve coffee.  All right.  Agreed.  Very funny.  I wanted to also say, I had called Steve and given him, you guys were talking to Donnie yesterday about some ad ideas.  And I had called Steve with a couple of ideas or emailed him them.  I don't know if they actually got past you guys.  But if you guys can check into it, kind of, you want to keep them on the download. 
[01:40:00]  Because I think it will really work for you guys in terms of advertising.  All right.  We get it.  We'll look for that.  And what's the third?  Also, sorry, the last thing is, do you guys think you guys could do a, you know, Jimmy, Last Comic Standing?  I mean, a lot of the material they did on that show, obviously, because of TV, they couldn't do the stuff.  Like, Jimmy's got some dirty humor.  Could you guys do, like, your own kind of Last Comic Standing on XM, where Jimmy gets a bunch of his friends together and we can hear some of their real material?  Aren't you the guy that hates Jimmy?  No, man. 
[01:40:30]  That's why he put you through.  Yeah, we thought.  He loves these calls.  Oh.  Yeah, this is a really boring call.  All right.  I'm punching us.  I thought it was the guy from Canada or Toronto that hated you.  He's the most exciting call from Canada, though, which is really telling.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  Sorry about that.  So, Paul and Yoko are at it again.  What, sex?  Yeah, right.  These guys, Paul and Yoko just absolutely hate each other, and they're fighting over yesterday again. 
[01:41:00]  With good reason.  Paul should shoot her in front of the Dakota.  This is just an amazing thing.  I was reading this the other day, and I just could not believe that this is going on.  I'll explain in a second here.  All you need is love, but don't tell that to Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono.  They're feuding.  Oh, you've got to put the stupid song lyrics in on this stupid story.  They're feuding again.  The latest Beatle battle erupted after Yoko refused to let Paul include his most famous love song yesterday on an upcoming solo album.  He wants to put yesterday on a solo album.  On one of his albums. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  Okay?  Yoko says no.  Even though Paul wrote it.  Oh, brother.  Here's the problem, though.  He and John Lennon shared credit for all the songs they wrote as Beatles.  It wasn't about individuals, obviously.  So they wrote all these songs for the Beatles, and they said, you know what?  We'll just give credit to everybody.  Or anyway, Lennon and McCartney.  Okay.  But the fact is, Paul McCartney wrote yesterday.  I would say, yeah, okay, I agree with that.  Where does it say Yoko on this?  This is where it gets crazy.  Paul hoped to have his collection of love songs out by Valentine's Day, but Yoko, who has a vote over Beatles matters, along with Paul, Ringo, and George Harrison's widow, Olivia. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, brother.  These bitches hit the lottery.  So Yoko nixed the idea.  She had nothing to do with the Beatles.  She had nothing to do with the song Yesterday, but she has a vote, as far as the Beatles go, into the future here.  She did have something to do with the Beatles.  She helped ruin them.  Right.  Stupid pig. 
[01:42:30]  She was like their Yoko.  Oh.  Yoko insists that because Yesterday is a Beatles song, it's a collaborative effort.  Even though Paul wrote, I mean, everyone admits that Paul wrote Yesterday.  You know something?  She could be absolutely right.  A collaborative effort of the Beatles.  Beatles, not the Beatles' wives.  What's her reason for saying no?  Does he not want to pay until that?  What's the problem?  Yeah, where's the problem?  God.  Sure comes down to money.  Talentless, a talentless leech is what she was. 
[01:43:00]  She just latched on to a rich, gifted guy and got her stupid.  She's an artist.  That's what she is.  She's good for nothing.  She's on her way to Boston with a dirty bomb.  Last I saw on the paper.  She really should be standing on someone's back and then yanking on them and then cleaning  stuff off her hands and nodding politely.  That's what she should have done.  Paul can't believe she's being so petty.  The song, Snafu, is just the latest blow up in a few that's simmered for years, as we  all know by now, right?  Since Lennon's death, it has bugged McCartney that he doesn't get more credit for his compositions. 
[01:43:30]  And Paul's wife, Heather, has been fanning the fire since they started dating.  Heather's been whispering in Paul's ear.  Don't fan it too close to that wooden leg.  She told him he had the right to claim the credit for his own songs, whatever his agreement  with Lennon was.  In 2000, Paul asked Yoko if he could change the credit for yesterday on the Beatles' one  album.  Yoko said no.  He was furious because it's many people's favorite song and he wants the world to know  he wrote it.  Now he's being petty.  So McCartney hit back by flip-flopping the traditional Beatles writing credit of Lennon and 
[01:44:00]  McCartney to McCartney and Lennon in the liner notes of a live album of his 2002  U.S. tour.  Yoko then retaliated by removing McCartney's name from the credits for Give Peace a Chance  on the Lennon Legend DVD.  It's getting very petty, obviously.  Babies!  Yeah.  I like the order this way better.  I like the order that way better.  Who cares?  Like anyone notices.  Like anyone notices when they go to put one of these songs on whose name is first.  McCartney Lennon.  But the point I'm trying to make, the point I want to make here, it's crazy that these 
[01:44:30]  guys are dying off and then the wives are having a say as far as what they're going to  do with the Beatles songs and the Beatles catalogs.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  And the living Beatles.  She has a vote and Harrison's wife now has a vote.  The living Beatles have to deal with what's going on.  Deal with ex-wives.  Oh.  How are they equal to, you know, Paul and Ringo?  Right.  How is that possible?  Eventually they're all going to die and what? 
[01:45:00]  It's going to be up to the wives to decide what to do with the Beatles catalog and the  Beatles song and the Beatles legacy?  Just picture if I leave this mortal coil, Opie having to talk to my ex-wife if he could play  butt plug.  Butt plug?  Stop it!  A little known fact, we both did a butt plug prank call.  Yours just happened to be a little better.  Oh.  Hence it made it onto the CD and mine is just, it's just out there. 
[01:45:30]  It's out there.  Being heard in space somewhere.  Space somewhere.  Some aliens are picking it up right now.  And my version of butt plug, I must say, was pretty good.  Did you say butt plug?  I said butt plug many, many times.  It was?  Yeah, we did like three or four different versions of it.  Yeah, there was scrotum.  Scrotum?  There was fellatio.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there were a few.  There were a few.  But butt plug worked the best, really.  Scrotum was pretty funny, though.  Maybe we'll play that going into break.  But it's pretty amazing, though. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it's depressing for the living Beatles, the two that are left.  That they have to deal with these two.  The two wives that had nothing to do with the, you know, when the band got together and was doing their thing.  Stop.  So, there you go.  Paul, who wrote yesterday, can't put it on one of his CDs.  She did ruin the Beatles.  She just ruined it, and now she's still.  Imagine Paul, he probably just wants to shoot her in the head. 
[01:46:30]  Why, oh, why was it, John?  I'm sure that's what he's saying.  Why was it, John?  Why couldn't that guy just have aimed at her first?  Ugly old bag of meat.  Ugh.  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me, love.  Oh, her awful music.  That was your contribution.  Her awful music.  Garbage.  That awful photo of them naked.  Her with her flat Asian ass and short legs.  And that huge, disgusting mess in her lap. 
[01:47:00]  Looked like she had a pair of black shorts on.  Oh, God, it looked like the tsunami wreckage strewn on the beach.  It was a mess.  She forgot what her job was.  Her job was to lay back while the genius emptied himself.  That's what your job was.  You were a receptacle for the seed of brilliance.  That's it.  All you need is a ball. 
[01:47:30]  That's right.  I like to dump all over this yellow submarine.  I'm filling a hole.  What a hell they have to live through, that they have to deal with this.  They watch their friends die, their friends that they made this music with for years and  years, and then all of a sudden, instead of discussing this with your friends, they're 
[01:48:00]  long gone.  Now you've got to discuss it with these jizz buckets that were there to satisfy their  men.  Now they've got to discuss business matters with them.  That's just amazing.  Oof.  It's amazing.  If the captain and Tennille have a problem, maybe they should both have equal say, because  they both contributed to the music.  There you go.  When your job was to lay there, and then while the genius slept, to get a washcloth and clean  off your stomach, and that is your job, baby carrier, you gave nothing to the Beatles. 
[01:48:30]  Nothing.  Jeremy?  You're hated by Beatle fans.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jeremy.  Doesn't Michael Jackson own the rights to all the Beatles songs anyway?  No.  Some, right?  Well, he did for a while, and then...  Oh, they finally got him back?  I don't know.  Some of the catalog.  It was some of...  McCartney sold him some.  We need a Beatles expert.  Where's Lady Di?  Oh, hi.  Yeah.  I'm a Beatles expert.  Get Lady Di on the phone and talk about the Beatles, because I think that was a problem, 
[01:49:00]  too.  Michael Jackson had some of the songs, and then Paul or somebody wanted to use the songs,  and Michael's now telling them, no, you can't.  No, you can't.  And they never wanted the songs to be used in commercials.  Well, that's his problem for selling them.  Why did he sell them?  Yeah.  You know?  Like, McCartney needed money?  Why is he selling them to Michael Jackson?  McCartney's got it worth two or three million dollars.  I mean, there's no way he's not worth that much.  Three and a half, maybe.  The story goes...  I can't remember exactly, but when Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney did that duet, 
[01:49:30]  that stupid song, they became kind of friends, and...  Say, say, say what you want.  Where they're on the back of the truck, selling, like, the elixir or whatever.  With the thing that makes young boys forget what happened to them.  Selling Jesus juice off the back of his truck.  Say, say, say what you want to the judge and prosecuting attorneys, faggot pedophile.  Make me nauseous.  We don't need to take any more calls about Jimmy sucking. 
[01:50:00]  We got that point there.  Thank you.  Let's go to Andy in Ohio.  Andy, go ahead.  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Morning, Andy.  Hi, Andy.  Oh, take the call.  Take the call.  Don't let love to go.  No, because it's boring after a while.  What are you going to say?  Take it.  Go ahead, Andy.  Take it.  Do you know, I don't know exactly how it goes, but I think Paul McCartney actually sent Yoko  over to John's house as a joke.  She was stalking Paul.  Paul invited her in.  It was real nice to her and said, well, I think I might have somebody that you might 
[01:50:30]  be interested in and sent her over to see John.  Wow.  That would be an ironic little twist.  We need a Beatles expert.  How are you?  Practical jokes gone wrong.  Yeah.  I'm not buying that.  Now that sounds like an urban Beatle, urban legend.  Want to play Brother Joe's song about Paul McCartney's One-Legged Wife?  It's One-Legged Wife, huh?  Yeah.  Pop it in.  Lady McCartney used to have two feet. 
[01:51:00]  Plain to see your lower halves incomes lead.  Saved lots of money.  Got a great excuse.  Can't have flights on pedicures, boots and shoes.  Every night she takes on for prosthetics.  Hops in circles when she tries to run.  Yes, she only has to tie one shoelace. 
[01:51:30]  She has a stub.  Lady McCartney always has a pet.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Yes.  Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[01:52:00]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  She has a stump  Lady McCartney  Outside on the deck  Get the rapist from a chewing on your leg  Tuesday afternoon she's looking sexy 
[01:52:30]  Then I lift her skirt and see that stump  Close my eyes and stand the sides while effing  She has a stump  Lady McCartney  Or should I say Eileen  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen 
[01:53:00]  Oh, that's funny. Very nice. I like that one.  You gotta stump. Stump, stump, stump.  Hey, your brother's talented, man. Let's go to TJ on Long Island. TJ, what's up, buddy?  Yo, ONA, what's up, man?  What's up, man?  Yo, what's up, Jimmy?  Hey, TJ.  Yeah, listen, I don't know if you guys remember me. I'm from the original ONA, the Nighttime Attitude.  TJ from BAB. What's up, brother, man?  Yo, what's up, guys. Listen, I hear that royalties go four generations. Like, their great-great-grandkids are gonna be fighting over this shit. 
[01:53:30]  I'm sure.  That's messed up.  Well, that's gotta be known. All their ancestors are gonna be fighting over who gets the money.  Well, as long as there's some blood involved, that's fine, I think.  Yoko.  You know, Sean should be fighting over it, not Yoko.  True.  Yeah.  All right. Thanks, TJ.  Yo, punch it out. Love you guys, man.  Have you done anything with your life, or what?  Yeah, I'm working it, man. I'm working it. I got my own business now.  When did you turn black?  Who, me?  Yeah, you, like, have a wigger thing going on. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  It's not the same TJ I remember.  Oh, okay. Hold on.  Dude, what's up, man?  Yeah, there you go. That's how you used to be.  Yo, I'm punching out.  Ooboo-boo.  He's like, ah, ha, ha, ha.  You're gonna be ooboo-boo-boo-boo.  I have no idea what that means, though.  Of course you don't.  You don't acknowledge that anymore.  In other music news, Anthony, there's a petition online to stop Ashley Simpson.  We got that audio?  Oh, we gotta get the Bob Kelly thing, too.  There is such a backlash with this broad.  Yeah.  You know, you definitely have to have done something wrong for there to be this public backlash at you. 
[01:54:30]  She comes off so snotty.  Mm-hmm.  And so, like, somebody like that, if you're talented and really talented, where even people that can't stand you go, wow, I really hate the fact that she's that talented, then you could get away with being like that.  Like, someone like Christina Aguilera could say whatever the hell she wants.  She could get on stage and sing, and it's amazing, and she's a performer, you know? 
[01:55:00]  But this just sister of somebody that's gonna be famous for 15 minutes.  Awful.  And people hate her.  They now hate...  She's in the category of hated by everybody.  When you have 75,000 people booing you at a stadium, you're pretty much done lip-syncing.  Because people get sick of the business forcing through this garbage.  Yeah.  And this is just a backlash against the garbage they force through. 
[01:55:30]  And you're supposed to just lap it up and go, ooh, this is good.  Thank you for feeding us this garbage, this crap.  No one...  I don't know one person that is into this chick.  Ugh, she's terrible.  I don't know one person.  Maybe, like, a junior high school girl likes her.  But I don't know...  There's no huge groups of people chanting more and more out of this waste. 
[01:56:00]  Teenage girls don't even like her.  No?  No, because you think she's pop like her sister,  but she's trying to do, like, the Avril Lavigne angry rock thing,  and she can't do it, and everyone just boos her everywhere.  Can't stand Avril Lavigne, either.  I don't know what she says.  Angry for no reason.  But she's kind of talented.  Yeah, you gotta give her that.  I guess she writes her stuff, too, Avril Lavigne.  And whether you like it or not, at least she's writing stuff.  Oh, here it is.  And then she kind of looks hot sometimes, Avril Lavigne,  with her too much mascara and stuff. 
[01:56:30]  Awesome.  But this one is just a...  She isn't even attractive like her sister is, you know?  Her sister's all hot on that stupid show.  Big cans, you know?  It's cute.  But she is just...  Well, she got a break of a lifetime because she's Jessica's sister,  and MTV decided to throw this show together  where they try to make her a pop star.  But the fact is, she never really had talent.  I mean, she has an okay singing voice.  That's where the backlash comes from.  Yeah, exactly.  And they, you know, I don't know what you were saying  because I was trying to find an email. 
[01:57:00]  But they, you know, and then they try to, you know,  just produce a pop star.  Yeah, doesn't work.  Create a pop star from scratch.  Oh, jeez.  What?  Showing a picture of her and her sister walking down the street.  Jessica just looks great.  Ashley looks like a frump.  Look at this.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that great?  That's got to kill you every day.  Ugh.  It's got to kill you every day.  Dyed her hair black to try to separate herself from her sister. 
[01:57:30]  The absolute lack of talent does a nice job of separating them.  It's garbage.  So the latest is, she sang at the Orange Bowl.  I think you might have heard this audio by now.  And she just failed miserably.  And something like, what, 50,000, 60,000 people were booing her.  And there's one guy in this tape, if you listen closely,  one of the listeners brought to our attention.  You hear, you suck!  Yeah.  All right.  And here's the tape.  You make me want to...  You make me want to...  You make me want to... 
[01:58:00]  You make me want to...  You make me want to...  You make me want to...  Ugh.  You suck!  Kelly...  Kelly Clarkson and Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson,  part of our halftime show at the FedEx Orange Bowl.  Part of our halftime show.  Part of our halftime show.  Hey, there they are getting booed.  Part of our halftime show. 
[01:58:30]  Ugh.  So obviously she was getting booed.  And if you listen closely, you heard the guy say you suck, right?  Okay?  Yeah.  So Bob Kelly helped us out.  He got a clipping from a newspaper where Ashley is quoted.  Ashley Simpson on MTV on her bad reception at the Orange Bowl.  She says, Anthony.  Are you ready for this?  How delusional this bitch is?  Maybe they were booing at me.  Maybe they were booing at the halftime show because the whole thing sucked.  I was facing the Oklahoma Sooners and I was rooting for USC and they played a clip of it. 
[01:59:00]  So maybe it was that those people didn't like me.  You never know, but I can't make everybody happy.  Yeah, that's it.  How about making one person happy, you talentless whore?  She's terrible.  What does it say right into that, too?  Is there more in that article or no?  No, something about sushi.  She stinks like sushi.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  What an ass.  What an ass.  So, yeah, so there's the quote.  And then it says Ashley Simpson on MTV on her bad reception at the Orange Bowl. 
[01:59:30]  And there is something under it.  Okay?  It says, Robert Kelly will be playing Rascals Comedy Club in Montclair, New York.  New Jersey, Thursday, January 20th through January 23rd.  Phone number 973-744-3711.  And then it has the website www.rascalcomedyclub.com.  This freaking zero added his plug to the story.  Added a newspaper at the end.  But it looks like it's part of the newspaper.  Yeah, he didn't just send an email.  He sent the actual picture of the newspaper clipping and added that to the story. 
[02:00:00]  What a nothing.  So, uh.  Should have put it in the story.  So, now there's a middle of the line.  So, now there's a Stop Ashley website.  And it's an open letter to Geffen.  It says,  We, the undersigned, are disgusted with Ashley Simpson's horrible singing and hereby ask her to stop, stop recording, touring, modeling, and performing.  We do not wish to see her again.  She cannot match the sound of her voice that can be found on her CDs.  When she sings live, she simply yells the words, sometimes the wrong ones, into the mic. 
[02:00:30]  We are so sickened by her performing that we are taking this opportunity to demand that she stops.  Sincerely, the undersigned.  How many do they have?  It's actually, uh, the website's getting a lot of, uh.  Oh, there were tens of thousands.  A lot of heat, yeah.  Yeah, and then, uh, it's, uh, making newspaper articles and stuff.  What's the website?  It was in the post the other day.  Yeah, I think it's just stopashley.com.  Yeah.  I believe.  Yeah, there was a whole article in, uh, in the Daily News the other day. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, that's great.  It was 65,000 people.  It turns out football fans aren't the only ones fed up with Ashley Simpson's seemingly omnipresent, uh, Catterwall?  Catterwall.  Ever since the, the, the detuned diva shrieked her way through the Orange Bowl halftime show,  an army of detractors have been assembling on the internet.  Leading the charge is an online petition at www.stopashley.com.  More than 65,000 people have added their digital signature to a document that requests, uh, 
[02:01:30]  simply that Simpson stop recording.  Why would the Orange Bowl put her in there?  I mean, that's, it's not just her.  Why would they continue to give her gigs when they know she sucks?  Uh, it's probably her record company making little deals.  Hey, include her in.  We'll get you this guy for some other event.  You know, it's all about, uh, your agent and, and your record company and favors that could  be done.  This girl's an albatross though.  Oh, she's not humble about it. 
[02:02:00]  She just thinks she's arrogant and she's constantly making excuses and we hate arrogant people in  this society.  She is like just digging her own grave.  Uh, Ashley Simpson has only graced us with her so-called talent because of her sister's  position in our society.  That's one of the people that, uh, wrote.  She has, uh, no good talent whatsoever and I think she's a fake sleazy little princess who  does not deserve any fame or attention.  I agree with that.  I, I hope soon that she will be old news and then there's an idiot.  There's always one.  Give her a break, writes John Lemming. 
[02:02:30]  So she messed up a few times.  So what?  We're all just human.  Nobody is perfect.  Well, at least the guy had some original thoughts to add in.  It's pretty, uh, edgy stuff to say.  Last name Lemming.  John Lemming.  You know what?  Yoko Uno is his wife.  Here's a point though and this is where it's, it just gets sad.  Ashley cares deeply about the opinions of all her fans, as Simpsons spokesman said.  But the fact is, her album has sold 3.5 million copies for that crap. 
[02:03:00]  Who's buying those albums?  It's because of MTV.  You know, there's a big, uh, show on MTV making her a pop star so everyone goes out like Lemmings  and buys the stupid album.  I'll hunt those people down that bought that album.  Hmm.  I don't even know if I believe that figure.  Yeah.  I don't know if I believe it.  I don't believe it.  3.5 million?  Show me proof.  Alright, as we go to break one more time, Ashley Simpson just eating it at the Orange Bowl.  We have more of the song or no?  Just that one part. 
[02:03:30]  No.  It's horrible.  Listen to her voice cracking.  She's screaming over the, uh, the music and noise.  And her voice cracks really bad toward the end.  And then, of course, listen right after she gets done.  You hear, you suck.  La, la, la, la, la.  You made me want, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You made me want, la, la, la, la.  You made me want.  Hey! 
[02:04:00]  Kelly, Kelly Clarkson, Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson, part of our halftime show at the  FedEx Orange Bowl.  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.

Come see why folks have coined Steamboat, the land of the free, home of the brave, and 
[02:05:00]  playground of the red-blooded powder hounds.  Visit Steamboat.com where they picked up a couple feet of snow over the past week.  Powdery snow everywhere you go thanks to big snowstorms.  20 inches early this week at Squaw Valley.  Powder skiing on 100% of their terrain.  Timberline, Oregon just got 6 inches of snow to 75% of their trails.  Sun Valley, Idaho is on 75-pack powder slopes.  The Seattle Ridge and the Bowls are open.  The Canyons in Utah on 138 trails. 
[02:05:30]  They got 2 feet of snow this week.  And a chilly weekend for Vail and Aspen where both spots picked up a foot of snow over the  past couple of days.  Snow making back in a big way at Snowshoe Mountain West Virginia.  More than 50% of their terrain is open.  And Sunday River in Maine with 42 miles of skiing will open the weekend on loose and frozen  granular on 8 mountains.  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's the O&A Virus.  XM 202.  XM News. 
[02:06:00]  It's everything.  All the time.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Did you nap during that break?  Did you take a little nap?  We're back?  How are we back?  Oh, I got a nice sleep during that break. 
[02:06:30]  That was so long.  That was a non-break.  That's insane.  Opie walks out of the studio.  And I look in the control room and they're waving their hands.  Oh, we're on.  I just went to take a leak.  That's all you really have time for.  What are they selling?  10 second spots?  This is stupid.  Washington wants us to break twice an hour for a minute and a half at a time.  It's ridiculous.  A minute and a half.  Throw the breaks together.  That's nuts.  What do we do with ourselves for three minutes? 
[02:07:00]  Are you insane?  Dude, you need to regroup when you do a radio show.  You just can't just go, all right, we'll break and then come back a minute and a half later.  I was going to drive home for that break and come back.  And everyone's panicking.  We're back.  We're back.  I'm like, I think Anthony can handle it.  Relax.  What's wrong?  What's going on?  I'm just totally fucking with Steve.  I'm pointing and he's looking around like, what are you doing?  Pointing at the floor, at the ceiling.  Steve's like, what?  You just do that naturally.  His arms are waving all over. 
[02:07:30]  Ben just loves messing with Steve.  I know.  It's great.  Ben loves when anyone is getting screwed with except him.  So if it's anyone except Ben, he's very happy about it.  So this is what we do because instead of playing commercials, you know, Jimmy's still leaking.  Yeah, Jimmy's not back.  You were thinking of getting up and you thought about it too long and all of a sudden we're  back.  So if you want to go take a leak, if you need to take a leak, you might as well take a leak.  This is ridiculous.  I was kicking back reading.  I think I got through one sentence.  It's too bad we're not going to Washington because that's something we need to talk about. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  I ain't going down there.  Ben's like, oh, the trains will still run during a nor'easter and a blizzard.  That's great.  I'm not going.  I don't care about the trains running.  It's getting to the train.  I'm going to have to drive from Long Island into Manhattan during a blizzard.  I really don't feel like doing that.  It takes hours in New York, hours during a blizzard to get from Long Island into New  York City.  It's amazing how long it takes.  All right.  Well, we're back.  What are we doing now?  How are you doing? 
[02:08:30]  How's everybody?  Oh, God.  I need a little longer break there.  I was going to go find, see if there was milk for some granola.  Did you get milk today, Jimmy?  Best you didn't.  No?  You want to get some milk and eat some cereal?  No.  You're not eating cereal today?  No, coffee.  Just coffee?  I don't want it.  I have too much coffee in my veins, so I need to like...  Simmer down a little bit?  Simmer down.  I need some milk and some granola.  Does that relax you?  Blueberries!  All right. 
[02:09:00]  Well, there's not much going on in the news.  So what we can do is we could talk about the top ten songs of the 90s, which is kind  of interesting.  They're doing a whole redo on...  We could play a really bad song about George W.  Oh, that is awful.  You want to hear it really fast as we try to figure it out?  VH1 is doing a whole brand new I love the 90s thing.  Yeah.  Have you seen it?  Any of it?  I love those shows.  They're like potato chips.  You just pop them on and...  Oh, I remember that. 
[02:09:30]  Why is that entertaining?  I know.  To watch something and go, oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was great.  Oh, that.  That sucked.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why is that entertaining?  I don't know.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's right.  Oh, I had that.  Yeah, right.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  Oh, my God.  Did I look just as stupid as that?  That's good.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah.  That was the guy I remember that did that.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember...  Yeah, exactly.  And we suck it right up. 
[02:10:00]  It's like, I remember when he was famous.  I forgot all about him.  That's right.  Hey, isn't that the guy from that show?  Right.  And now he's...  Yeah.  I remember watching that show.  And we just...  I sit there and watch every one of these.  1995.  1995.  Ooh!  Hey, I was...  I can't wait to see 95.  I was alive in 1995.  Yeah, I remember.  All right, we could do a little top 10 thing really fast here.  Top 10 songs in the 90s.  You want to do that?  Songs of the 90s.  Are they all grunge? 
[02:10:30]  Or do we cross genres?  No, that's the problem.  These are like more pop songs.  Awful.  Huh?  Are they awful?  Who made this list?  Where's the list from?  It's not a Rolling Stones list or something?  No, it's Nerviana.  Whatever it's called.  I don't know.  Courtesy of Nerviana.  Hmm.  Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Your favorite decade of music would be?  Favorite decade of music?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Let's see.  For casual, guilty pleasure listening in the 80s. 
[02:11:00]  Really?  Yeah, but for real rock music that I completely enjoyed, the 90s, yeah.  My favorite decade of music was the 90s.  Yeah.  Followed by the 70s.  70s.  Followed by the 80s and then the 60s.  Ooh.  70s were just amazing for rock music.  Yeah.  Absolutely amazing.  There was some real crap in the 70s, too.  But I really got into the whole grunge thing when that hit.  You liked things like, what, Afternoon Delight in the 70s?  Oh, dude, I'm talking, like, the Stones put out their best stuff, obviously, in the 70s, 
[02:11:30]  Zeppelin, you know, that type of thing.  Yeah.  I mean, the 80s was just all over the ball field, man, with the new wave and the hair bands.  Yeah, disco at the end of the 70s, though.  That kind of tainted the 70s for music, man.  I think I'm talking more rock, though.  Yeah.  I mean, rock didn't have much to offer in the 80s.  Really didn't.  I mean, yeah, you could say Metallica, things like that, sure.  That's the late 80s, too.  Right, but most of the 80s was, you know, most of radio was playing all that hair band 
[02:12:00]  crap in the 80s.  New wave.  New wave at the beginning.  New wave in the beginning, and then guys that looked like chicks.  New wave freaked out the rock guys in the beginning of the 80s, but we completely accepted  it by the end of the 80s.  Like, it accepted new wave.  Right.  But at the beginning, it was just like, fags.  Play some Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Faggots.  Yeah.  This guy hates me today.  Hold on a second.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Oh, listen to the show.  You mean Pappy from Jersey?  Pappy. 
[02:12:30]  I thought you liked me, Pappy.  Oh, Pappy.  Oh, I love you guys, but sometimes you get stuck on something.  When you were saying, oh, I remember that.  I remember that.  You sounded like Lady Di talking about Lost in Space.  No, but that was the bit.  That was the whole bit.  Like, oh, yeah, I remember.  I get it.  Well, then why do you guys keep saying, are you insane?  I say, yeah.  Well, my crutch is holy S. I say holy S a lot, which had to be pointed out on all the message  boards.  Yeah.  Okay.  I get it.  I get it.  I'll stop trying to say holy S. Relax. 
[02:13:00]  Crazy.  It's nuts.  Tell me where I can listen to your radio show.  Oh, you showed him.  What?  You showed him.  Which one?  That's just you.  That's a hysterical comeback.  Tell me where I can listen to your radio show.  That's almost nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  And it was meant that way, dude.  It was meant that way.  It's funny.  I mean, whatever.  So, the top ten songs of the 90s.  We could go through this list a little bit.  Tenth place, Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  I have no clue where to start.  Is it rock?  It's going to be everything.  It's going to be mostly poppy crap.  Mostly poppy crap.  With a little West Coast thrown in, a little West Coast rap.  Oh, really?  Yeah, West Coast rap definitely representing on this list.  I'm not too hip on that.  I'm not too familiar with that.  Do we have all ten songs?  We're not going to play the whole song, so relax.  No.  Tenth place, it's this little ditty.  Oh, top ten songs of the 90s. 
[02:14:00]  And tenth place, RuPaul, Supermodel.  RuPaul is going to reach your big hands and pull out a whip.  Oh, Frankie Blue.  On KTU, baby.  This is a gimmick song.  How could this be top song of the 90s, one of them?  It's a stupid gimmick song.  It was huge on pop radio, though, I guess. 
[02:14:30]  All right, enough of that crap.  Is that what it's based on?  How many spins it got?  Who knows?  Who knows?  That's horrible.  In ninth place, remember these two rappers?  Oh.  Salt and Pepper.  Isn't this En Vogue, though?  No?  Oh, it's both?  Yeah, this is Salt and Pepper with En Vogue.  And what a man, what a man, what a man. 
[02:15:00]  There you go.  What a couple of bruises these two were.  Jesus.  These are the kind of, like, girls, when they'd be on TV, you'd be, man, if you're effing them,  you better do it right.  Because they will kick your ass.  One of them is married to the lead rapper from Naughty by Nature.  Really?  Tretch?  Tretch?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Here's the dude that did, uh, You Down With OPP? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, really?  Tretch?  Short for treacherous, I would gather?  My name's Tretch.  You can never sell a name like Tretch, you know?  In eighth place, top ten songs in the 90s.  I didn't even know this came out.  It must have been 1999.  It's, uh, it's this awful piece of music.  Oh.  Yeah.  You saw him live, didn't you?  No.  Oh. 
[02:16:00]  Sorry, I thought you had to go because of a girl.  Wrong.  No?  What was the Ricky Martin story?  With me?  No, yeah, with you.  Was it an autograph or something?  No, dude.  What was it?  Nothing.  Wasn't it you two guys on the jet ski?  Huh?  No, because they were making photoshops of us on a jet ski with Ricky Martin.  It was, uh, Rick, our old producer had something, I don't know.  Oh, it was Rick?  Yeah.  And it was something with that whole family.  No, well, they, uh, the, uh, the paparazzi had a picture of Ricky Martin, you know, they're 
[02:16:30]  still trying to figure out if he's gay or not.  Right.  And they had some pretty weird photos of him on a jet ski holding another man or the other  man was holding him or something like that.  The jet skis are not meant for two men.  No, never.  Hold on tight.  We're going to be wet.  No, thank you.  I'm shirtless.  All right.  Spent enough on a bicycle in an emergency when you were a kid?  Like, I never liked that.  All right.  Sit on the seat.  I'll stand up.  What are you?  Hold on.  What?  When are you, when are you on a bike with another man because it's an emergency and 
[02:17:00]  you have to hold on?  No, as a kid, as a kid, I'm not letting you slide on that.  No problem.  As a kid, when you're riding your bike, when you're riding your bike and, uh, let's say  somebody, uh, I remember this actually happening.  Someone got their foot caught in the spokes of their bicycle and then had to ride on my  seat on the back of my bicycle while I stood up and pedaled.  And when they're doing that, they're taking phone calls and doing all kinds of things.  Hello?  Hey, Ralphie. 
[02:17:30]  How are you?  Oh, it's Ralphie May.  You're freezing your ass off in Poughkeepsie.  Yeah, I had to come up here and do a fucking radio.  How bad's the radio up there?  It's just me and you, you know.  The first one, not too bad.  I've heard from several people that the next one is the kiss of death.  Why is it the kiss of death?  Radio in Poughkeepsie.  The guy sounds like, uh, like the boss from, uh, uh, Office Space.  Um, I'm going to need you to come in tomorrow. 
[02:18:00]  He sounds like that.  All right.  So why are you calling?  Oh, because I wanted to call in, A, and apologize to you.  And B.  I wanted to, uh, tell you, if you want me to do it with the phone or, and tell that Ashley Simpson story, um, I got time and I'd love to.  You know, you really let us down, dude.  I, we really needed you yesterday and, uh, now it's kind of too late.  Well, yesterday, I, I didn't get a wake-up call from, uh, uh, uh, the kiss. 
[02:18:30]  Well, there's really no excuse for it, bro.  We really needed you yesterday.  I mean, if you're going to be helping out the radio show, I mean, you know, you really got to, you know, wake up and, uh, and call in.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  So.  Hold.  How long ago?  Uh, my apologies. 
[02:19:00]  And we tried to call in, and I called Ben, and I, uh, uh, they said that it was too late.  And they decided to worry about it.  It was like at 9.30.  And, uh, honestly, no problem.  You know, he's just thinking, what a dick.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever.  I mean, obviously, the show's not that important to you.  Not just, but, uh, you're finished.  I'm sorry.  Oh. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, man.  Good luck with Poughkeepsie Radio.  It's obviously more important to you.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  You hung up on him?  You left him hanging?  Dude, call him back.  Why?  What a prick.  Did you hear that over the air?  I did, over my headphones.  I hope the audience heard that.  And in a way, I hope they didn't.  That was awful.  You gotta call him back. 
[02:20:00]  You hung up.  No goodbye.  Nothing.  I ain't calling him.  What?  What?  Do you really feel that way?  No, I love the guy.  Let him sit there and sweat a little bit.  Ah, dead air.  Ah, I don't know if people actually heard that.  Really?  It was probably really low.  Yeah, it was probably low.  So if you're in the truck.  If you heard it in the headphones, no?  Yeah, I heard it.  If you heard it on your radios at home, please let us know.  Because that was really good. 
[02:20:30]  Radio on phone calls.  Well, yeah, it was down pretty low.  So if you didn't hear it, love the silence.  Yeah.  You know.  Really?  When Opie's phone started ringing, we heard that buzzing noise.  When you leave your phone next to the computer, same thing.  The cancer buzz.  You didn't really hear it?  Oh, man.  The guy was...  Hey, Ralphie.  Yeah.  Hey, bro.  We were just messing with you.  What's up, buddy? 
[02:21:00]  We were just messing with you.  Opie had his phone up to the microphone, so we were all listening to him giving you crap.  We got you bad.  You should have told him to go F himself.  I know, dude.  Man, what's wrong with you?  I would never tell him.  You're apologizing.  And he's right.  No, there's no right.  I was totally kidding.  Unfortunately, the listeners didn't get to hear you grovel.  Oh, was I groveling?  Oh, you were bad.  Anthony, how bad was he? 
[02:21:30]  It was pretty bad.  I'm so bummed that the listeners couldn't really hear that.  Opie gives you the whatever, and you're like, I'm sorry.  After the whatever, you follow whatever with go screw.  I thought you were getting over the top when you said, I guess you don't care about the show.  Okay, that was a bit much, but I was like, wow, I guess he's really into it.  I do apologize.  I'm kind of bummed that the listeners couldn't hear your side of the conversation, because  you're like, but really, I overslept, and I'm sorry, it won't happen again. 
[02:22:00]  I know.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Everyone turned up their radios real loud to hear Ralphie, and then I hit the car crash noise  and pulled out everyone's speakers.  So, Ralphie, you're up in Poughkeepsie today?  Yeah.  All right.  I got picked up at the hotel in Manhattan at like 4.30.  Wow.  And it's, man, it's so much colder up here than it is just like an hour south.  Yeah, no, it's just...  It's so much colder. 
[02:22:30]  It's just cold everywhere.  Ryan from Poughkeepsie writes, Ralphie was fake laughing all morning on the radio.  He had to deal with the worst two DJs ever.  Is that true?  They weren't too bad.  They played mullet rock.  Mullet rock.  Mullet rock.  They played Rush, and I was listening to it in upstate New York.  It wasn't too bad.  I mean, come on.  They had Playboy.  They had, you know, that's not too bad.  The girls are fear factor.  All right.  Well, you're...  And the chicks from the Fockers.  Not too bad. 
[02:23:00]  Come on.  You're at Bananas in Poughkeepsie tonight?  Yeah, Poughkeepsie tonight.  Two shows, 8 o'clock and 1045, and then somewhere in New Jersey tomorrow.  Hasbrokeyes.  Yeah, Hasbrokeyes.  We just talked about Ashley Simpson.  By the way, the online petition is now up to 126,000 names in there.  Wow.  We just played the audio from the Orange Bowl, and, Ralph, you were saying off air, right  after the show ended the other day, that your girlfriend was backstage at the Orange  Bowl?  Yeah.  A pal of mine, Trace Adkins, who's like a fan of mine, and I've known him for like three 
[02:23:30]  years.  Before he hit, he was the middle guy.  It was like the chick from American Idol, and then him, and then Ashley Simpson.  And he goes, they were walking off, and people were pelting her with beer, and throwing stuff  at her, and she had like these big bodyguards, and they went back in the green room, and were  throwing chairs all around, and fighting, and Daddy, Joe Simpson, was yelling at the 
[02:24:00]  Orange Bowl officials, and ABC, and the girl, Ashley Simpson, threw a chair through a plasma  screen, and those plasma TVs, and Trace was funny.  He goes, that girl needs to lose 25 pounds, and she wants a career, and learn how to suck  dick.  And I'm like, that's the best advice I've ever heard.  That chick needs to do that. 
[02:24:30]  You know, she's never going to be more talented than her sister's tits.  Right, well, so she lost her mind backstage there.  She broke the plasma TV with a chair.  Yeah.  And wasn't there a discussion with the father and the Orange Bowl officials before?  Yeah, the day before.  The Orange Bowl, and ABC went to them and said, she's horrible.  During the sound check, she needs to lip sync.  And they were like, no, she's absolutely not. 
[02:25:00]  She's going to show everybody she can really sing.  And the president of Geffen Records, he said, stood up and came over to him and goes, no,  she sings or we walk.  And then he said, it was like, it's all going to be fixed now, or I never have to worry about  this broad ever again.  And then you saw what happened, obviously.  Yeah, and then the disaster.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ralphie.  Well, no problem, guys.  Sorry to mess with you. 
[02:25:30]  Did Colin come in yet?  I think Colin's coming in in about 10 minutes.  Colin Quinn today.  Phenomenal.  An old friend.  It's going to be good to see him.  All right, Ralphie.  Good luck with the bananas thing.  All right, man.  Talk to you later, guys.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, kids.  Bananas.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  I just want to let you know that Ralphie did come through on the radio.  It was really loud.  And, man, it was really uncomfortable.  Yeah, that was really uncomfortable.  You know, like, uh, uh, uh, my apologies. 
[02:26:00]  My apologies.  He's just apologizing to Opie's whatever.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever, dude.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Well, the people that could hear it way in the background, they, uh.  Yeah, good job.  They probably enjoyed that a little bit.  All right, Jeff.  Thanks.  Uh, John from New York.  Opie's full of it.  I have the old MP3.  Anthony was getting ripped on for going to No Doubt, and he defended himself by saying  Opie had to get a signed CD from Ricky Martin.  That's what I remembered. 
[02:26:30]  I knew there was some Ricky Martin-Opie tie-in, but it was the, you had to get an autographed  CD.  I honestly don't remember.  And I didn't, I didn't, uh, personally, uh, get it signed.  So maybe through a record label or something, it was, it was sent to us.  I really don't remember.  I black things out, too, from certain periods in my life.  Like the handlebar story?  Oh, it wasn't the handlebar, it was the seat.  Where you were in an emergency and had to hold on to another guy as he peddled home?  No, no, I was riding the bike, and the guy is on the seat having to hold on to me. 
[02:27:00]  That's awful.  But why?  You never want a guy to hold on.  But you said it was an emergency.  Yeah, yeah, the foot got caught in the spokes.  Of his bike.  Of his bike.  So we had to ditch the bike.  What, were you in another state or something that it was an emergency that he had to ride  back home with you?  No, you gotta go back to the house.  Yeah.  Why didn't he just walk his broken bike home?  Because he couldn't walk.  So because, uh, oh, he couldn't walk.  Yeah, his foot was all screwed up in the spoke.  It wasn't that his bike got screwed up, his foot got screwed up.  Why didn't you call mommy to come get you?  On my cell phone in 1975? 
[02:27:30]  On my bicycle?  Hi, mom.  Hi, mom.  Yeah.  No, I'm calling from the street.  Yeah.  No, it's great.  Uh, I got it in a time machine.  I went forward into, uh, the thousands.  Yeah, it's cool.  It's gonna be great.  I get into radio.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, you sing really badly, too, and I play it a lot.  You're gonna love it.  You'll love the show.  But right now, I'm calling from a future cell phone.  Cells.  There are things like antennas, but... 
[02:28:00]  It's a portable phone!  It's a portable phone!  Unbelievable.  There was no calling.  There was...  You get the kid, it was like mash.  You gotta put him on the helicopter and take him back.  So...  There's no cell phone.  So the guy is, uh, has his arms wrapped around...  Bloody foot.  ...wrapped around your waist lovingly as you're pedaling back home?  I wouldn't call it lovingly.  I think he...  He had to hold on to, like, my belt loops or something to keep from falling off.  Uh, one bloody foot sticking out one side. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, you try to make it less faggoty.  I think every kid has had to give their friend a ride on their bike at some point.  Yeah, but your friend's not holding your junk as you're pedaling.  I didn't even remember saying holding my junk.  I think I said belt loops.  If that came out as junk, perhaps I made a mistake, but...  Well, roll back the tape.  I think you said he was awfully close to your junk as he was holding you lovingly.  As you...  And he was holding my belt loops.  I certainly don't remember junk. 
[02:29:00]  And, uh, yeah, I drove him back to his house where he limped in his front door and we didn't speak of it.  Was it an emergency when you were, uh, sleeping in the tree fort with your gay friend, too?  That was an emergency, all right.  You had no other place to sleep that night?  And it was an emergency?  It was either sleep with the gay guy in the tree fort or freeze to death out in the open, uh, plains?  To me, he was not the gay guy.  He was my friend, uh, until that very evening.  How many emergencies have you had in your life, Anthony? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  It's like an episode of ER, my life.  Many emergencies.  Woo!  Emergency!  Woo!  No, you've got to give a ride to your friend, but that's...  Sure, we understand.  And what I was saying was, it doesn't work on a jet ski because then it's really uncomfortable.  Because you're shirtless and wet, but it's okay on a bike.  On a bike when you're a kid.  See, I'm thinking jet ski might be less faggoty because there's a big seat there for both people. 
[02:30:00]  There certainly is.  And, and you, I do believe, uh, you have handles for the guy that's on the back if he really wants to hold on.  Some models do have the handles, uh, on the side that you want to hold on to.  But a bicycle has a tiny little seat.  That's why you've got to stand up if you're the one pedaling.  Oh, so you're standing up?  And you stand up, yeah, and they kind of hold on.  As your, your young buttocks is going up and down because you're pedaling?  Exactly.  My young, tender buttocks is, it certainly is. 
[02:30:30]  Oh dear, oh dear.  That's audio of you pedaling.  You will be molested.  Warning, warning, warning.  Yes, a warning indeed.  I'll hold on.  My foot, I've injured it in the spokes. 
[02:31:00]  Whoa!  I need a ride home.  Sweet, sweet home, please.  Pedal, Anthony, pedal, yes.  With you standing up pedaling and me sitting on the seat, I'm eye level with your little buttocks.  Yes.  So, so your friend was sitting comfortably on your seat.  Yeah, as I was pedaling, uh, him home with his bloody foot.  And he was holding on to your, your belt.  My belt loops. 
[02:31:30]  Your belt loops.  My little, my little tough skins pants belt loops.  So he was holding on to your jeans.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Holding on to the belt loops of my jeans.  Eh, all right.  Nothing, nothing more than just, uh, children, um, during playtime, trying to get home.  Wasn't like I pulled, skidded under a porch with him or anything and yelled Monster Rain or something.  Don't drag Jimmy into this.  I'm not dragging him into it.  I'm just commenting.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  Why?  I've never given a ride to a friend on a bicycle.  I never asked you why were you in the tree fort with the gay guy.  Uh, we were sleeping.  We used to, like, camp out.  So we were sleeping out.  And it was a tree fort at the, uh, ranch down at the, the stable where we kept our horses.  And, uh, he wasn't the gay guy.  Like I said, he was just like my best friend.  And then all of a sudden we were reaching that age where I guess, uh, he made a turn.  Uh, and then all of a sudden he's, you know.  Was he wearing a, uh, three-piece suit?  No.  With a Gucci, uh. 
[02:32:30]  No Gucci belt.  No Bruno Mali pants.  No?  No, no.  Or shoes, whatever.  Just like, uh, regular, regular clothing, I would gather.  And, uh, he turned on me like that.  He's trying to get a good night's sleep.  I hear that over, you know.  Hey, do you want me to suck you?  Are you awake?  Hey, Anthony, are you awake? 
[02:33:00]  I'll suck on you.  And there I was.  Just sleeping.  My eyes shut real tight.  That wasn't the only thing shut real tight that night.  Jeez.  I pulled my Gucci belt real tight. 
[02:33:30]  If you, if you want me to, it's okay.  I'll suck on it.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  I'm just there going, oh, please.  When is the sun coming up?  To me, it was like night of the living homo.  I was just, when the sun comes up, everything will be okay.  But until now, I must batten down the hatch. 
[02:34:00]  Make sure there's no entry.  You didn't run homo or anything?  Homo what?  Did you run homo?  Oh, I thought I said, did I run homo or anything?  No.  No, I just feigned sleeping.  You only bite homo.  Yeah.  Homo.  I figured it would...  You'd bite home.  Home.  Yeah.  Como.  I just figured I would, you know, wait it out.  Just feigned sleep, and he stopped after a couple of suggestions and went to sleep, and 
[02:34:30]  that was it.  Oh, I thought you meant he stopped after a couple...  Yeah.  Well, hey.  It's not gay if you don't push back, so...  Push back.  If your hips aren't moving forward, thrusting.  Oh, that's funny, man.  That was odd.  Yeah, the friendship just was never the same after that.  Let's say hi to Tom in Cleveland.  Tom?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Where's my little marmalade spreader? 
[02:35:00]  Right here, buddy.  Hey, nice to hear you.  Jimmy's reading the paper.  Hey, no, the reason I was calling, I got a...  One time I gave a ride to a buddy of mine.  We're riding down to Steep Hill over in my neighborhood, and he's...  I got a guy in the handlebars and a guy in the pegs.  Well, I should go real fast.  The guy in the back jumped off.  Then I hit a bump.  The guy named...  His head smashed his face right in the concrete.  Ooh.  I gave him a ride home on a bike.  Where did he sit? 
[02:35:30]  Hello?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's that?  Where did he sit on the bike when you gave him a ride?  I'm sorry.  Your volume's cutting out.  Is he playing the same joke on me?  Never mind.  I don't care.  All right, guys.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Good job.  Thank you.  Because I think he had written handlebars or something, and I never got that.  I was never able to give anyone a ride on the bike on the handlebars.  Interfered with the steering and everything.  That was a little too weird, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Now to have him tightly hanging onto my jeans.

[02:38:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The rhythm of this show today is all over the place.  That's all right.  When you do a radio show, you need like a rhythm.  And these breaks just seem way too short today.  You can't get anything done during the breaks.  You can't regroup.  You can't take a leak.  Jimmy's gone again.  He's trying to...  You barely got your blueberries into your granola in time.  Granola.  That stuff is just compacting itself in your duodenum. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but you told me to add...  I listened to my friend.  Fruit?  You told me to add fruit.  That'll help me out.  You want to make things move along, as they say, and not bind up.  Do blueberries do it?  As you chew your gravel blueberries and milk.  Here comes stalker Patty, everyone.  Patty was in, like, last week, and then she had to leave, and then she said, 
[02:39:30]  could I come back tomorrow?  I got a present.  So she came back.  We made her sit there for three hours, never invited her in.  She had to go to work at Godiva, and now she's back with her presents or something.  Late presents.  Patty, you know, are you wearing a bra?  No, I never wear a bra.  Why don't you wear a bra?  I don't need one.  I know you got small ones, but...  Ugh.  Thank you.  I know I'm going to be 50 on my next birthday. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, those little chiclet teeth.  Oh, my God.  What's up with the teeth?  She's got little chiclets.  Did you eat peanut butter before you came in here today?  She's got little chiclets.  I'm not digging the braless look, man.  She's an old hippie chick.  Yeah.  What I have to give you is something I should have given you in December, but because of  the WOW logo, it took an extra two weeks.  What a suicide note, I hope.  No, the signs for your desk.  Remember I gave you the photo and said it's coming in January? 
[02:40:30]  What?  I wasn't listening.  I just tuned her out completely.  All right.  You have gifts.  Yeah, but they're just from Christmas.  It's just that the WOW logo made it take an extra two weeks at the print shop when they  had these done.  At the print shop.  Listen to that voice.  Yeah.  All right.  And you brought them in.  And what are they, Patty?  What are the gifts that you have for us?  They're two signs for your desk.  They're like desk plaques, like you would see on Mr. White's desk on a Superman episode. 
[02:41:00]  Perry White, Editor-in-Chief.  Yes.  Things like that.  It's like that plaque that when you get fired, it's the thing poking out of the top of the  box that you take to the elevator.  The little name plaque for the desk.  Yes.  And they kept the WOW sticker, so the guy that did it must have been a fan or something.  Must have something.  I never got the WOW sticker back.  Or a thief.  All right.  Well, let me see one of those, Patty. 
[02:41:30]  Pass that over to Jimmy.  He'll pass it down to Jimmy.  That's yours.  Or to pass it to Jimmy.  To Jimmy.  Pass it to...  Oh, good.  I wish.  I'm up for you.  Gee, thank you.  Let me see.  Yep.  Custom made.  All right.  It says Anthony on mine.  And then under it, in the font that we've grown so used to, it says WOW.  Yep.  White lettering on a dark, dark greenish background in a gold little frame. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Where it is now sitting.  It took about three weeks because of the WOW logo.  Three weeks.  Yeah, because I wanted something specially done.  There we go.  Should I put it here?  Look.  I'm open for business.  Ha ha.  There we go.  Look where you put yours, Anthony.  It's so nice.  I put mine right in front of me on the console so now people that come in, they can know I'm  Anthony.  Wow.  Right?  Ha ha ha ha.  I want to put mine down too.  You want to put yours?  You're very funny, Opie. 
[02:42:30]  They cost a lot of money.  What, did you make it?  Yeah.  Right in the garbage?  Uh-huh.  Well, you're making, you're pulling down a nice dime these days, Patty.  Hey, I remember when you used to make your presents for us with a glue gun and gold paint  and macaroni, and now you can buy things because you work.  How much are you pulling in a week?  Uh, about $2.50 if the tax is $2.25.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nice.  Notice this just comes right out.  It's just a piece of extruded metal. 
[02:43:00]  Can it be any thinner?  That they could just...  Nah, it's a nice gift, I guess.  Very good.  Oh, I hope you think so.  Oh, I hope you think so.  I remember the old days when Patty used to give gifts, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  It never really lasted very long.  Well, I was poor in those days.  What can I do?  I worked at McDonald's.  Oh, she's going to laugh at that now.  Now I'm a good dime.  I'm in a better place.  Now I'm a good day. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you bring some chocolate?  We actually enjoyed that gift.  Oh, my God, we did.  Oh, next time I come, I'll bring some.  Patty, where am I supposed to put this, quite frankly?  Don't you each have your desk?  To be honest with you, to be completely honest with you, what am I supposed to do with this?  Oh, I just thought it would be nice to put on your desk or something.  Oh, my desk.  My desk faces a wall.  If I had a desk, if I had a big wood desk where people walked in and saw the front of my desk and I could put this on there in front of my humidor and blot her, perhaps then it would be appropriate. 
[02:44:00]  But the truth of the matter is, I have nowhere to put this.  You know where this is going to go?  This is going to go with a pile of stuff I never touch.  Right there.  I really have no use for it.  None.  I just thought it was a nice gesture, you know.  Nice gesture, awful gift.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I loved my gift.  What am I going to do with this? 
[02:44:30]  Anthony, wow.  Let me put that on my desk.  I'll put it next to my computer so it faces me so I can look at who I am all day.  I'm Anthony.  And I know this because I have a plaque that says it.  Patty, why do you waste your money?  It's a waste of your money.  Now, what did this cost?  Be honest.  What did this cost?  Be honest.  You know what it cost. 
[02:45:00]  Patty?  Embarrassed.  About $18, $19 each with tax.  $20, $40 you spent on these plaques.  And they are ridiculous.  I'm sorry.  Yes, you are.  It's not going to get used.  All right.  Okay.  All right already.  I heard you.  Do you think these things out? 
[02:45:30]  Do you project ahead what's going to happen after you give this to...  My original gift was to get a curtain for that window so that when you do these type things  we don't talk about, you just close it.  When we clear our throats?  You know, hint, hint, you know, whatever.  Oh, my God.  That was my original gift.  And then I told Opie in the diner I want to pick up something like that so I can cover  because you were talking about it so much.  Patty, do you...  Patty, did you save the receipts for these? 
[02:46:00]  No, I throw everything away.  You threw it away?  Yeah.  If you took this back, could you get your money back?  Not really.  No, I don't think it's refundable because it's already made.  Patty, take this back.  Give that to Patty.  Oh, my God.  I'm not accepting your gift.  I would love to...  What's wrong with you?  It's...  I'm being honest with her so she doesn't continue to waste her money.  You wasted $20, Patty.  I'm not going to use that. 
[02:46:30]  I didn't know what to do for Christmas.  I think next time I'll just bring a box of chocolates.  That's all.  There you go.  You work at Godiva.  You could pick up the chocolates.  We all enjoyed them.  We were opening up the boxes and eating our little chocolates.  Yeah.  Then you go and spend $18 on something that I swear to you,  is ridiculous.  I just figured it would just be like something kind of nice  because I felt a little bit embarrassed just bringing chocolates, you know? 
[02:47:00]  That was a job.  I'm just trying to get through her playing it out in her head.  I will give them the plaques.  Where could they put it?  On their desk.  Yeah, because you're talking about your office.  That's what you're talking about.  Yeah, our office, not the head of IBM's office.  You know what our office is like.  Do you see our offices having name plaques on the desks?  No, you're not corporate people.  I just thought it would be. 
[02:47:30]  And a big electric.  We'll put it next to the electric stapler for our stapling paperwork.  It was a dumb idea that didn't work.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Patty, I don't know what's gotten to Anthony, but I'm really going to enjoy my gift.  Thank you.  Sure you will.  Yeah.  Why not?  Here I am.  I'm Opie.  Sorry.  Yes, you are.  And I could tell you are by the plaque in front of you.  Oh, getting off the subject.  Last time, we were talking about my stress test. 
[02:48:00]  And I found, I don't know what they did, but they put an IV in my arm.  They made me put my arms like this, and they put me in this chamber to take this huge thing  that rotated, like pictures of my heart.  Rotated.  I love how she takes accents and puts them on words where they just don't belong.  Well, anyway, they found out that I have my Traval prolapse.  What's that?  It's a lazy valve in the heart.  Oh!  I was going to tell you to play the laugh track, but you can play the laugh track on 
[02:48:30]  this, especially if the medication...  Stop yelling!  Stop yelling!  Sorry, this is the big and bolder, Patty.  Oh, you're so big and bold.  Well, anyway, they told me if the medication doesn't work, there's only one other alternative.  I hate this place!  Nothing works here!  The medications don't work!  It'll be open-heart surgery with a heart-lung machine. 
[02:49:00]  Holy jeez!  But I don't know, it may not happen.  Maybe the medication will work.  They'll know in May, when they examine me again.  Oofah!  You're just a killjoy today.  Oh!  I just wanted to give you something to laugh at to turn it around.  Oh, yeah, that's hysterical.  Oh, now I gotta take the plaque back.  Oh!  Did you see that jerk? 
[02:49:30]  That's great.  You know what I like better?  When Opie does the Satan voice.  Better than the laugh track.  When he acts evil.  Yeah.  Well, so you'll know in May?  Yeah.  Well, they'll examine me again.  They'll bring me through the stress test and sonogram again.  Oh, very good. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, what happened there?  That's falling out of the plaque, the one that says Opie.  Yeah, can I have that back?  Give that back to Opie.  He's gonna break it in half.  Oh, no.  Because that's what you're expecting.  I don't do the expected.  I know.  Great.  Oh, jeez.  Thanks, Patty.  Oh, you're so welcome.  Anything else?  No.  No, that's all I wanted to do, is just drop it by. 
[02:50:30]  I said it was coming late.  Need a haircut or anything?  No.  Heck no.  Did you get your gyno appointment?  No, not yet.  There's like a six-month waiting list.  You know, so.  Wow.  But they did find out what my hormone levels were, which was amazing.  I'm supposed to be about 25 to 30, and my levels are over 60.  They said I have the levels of a 30-year-old.  They don't understand why.  They said it's hereditary. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, because your mom was a slut, right?  I don't know.  I wouldn't know.  Why is she clenching her neck as she talks?  She's like, oh, weird.  She's twitching.  She's like Ben.  I never knew my mother, really, so I don't know what she did before I was flying.  I know.  She dropped you off in a diner is what happened.  Wow, Patty.  The belt is very sexy.  I like the belt today.  What is that, Gucci?  No, it's strawberries.  I got a gift certificate from a friend to go to strawberries, and I needed jeans. 
[02:51:30]  I just care.  All right.  Thanks, Patty.  Patty, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Are those the poker chips that went flying?  Yeah, those.  What would you do with those, unless you play poker?  You're saying the poker chips aren't a good gift?  No.  Can you move that pail?  Keith, move the pail.  Oh, no.  I don't want to.  Thanks, Patty.  Don't throw them at me.  I'm not going to throw them at you.  No. 
[02:52:00]  No.  I was a very good athlete in high school.  Patty, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Come on.  Let us know how things are going, and we'll talk to you soon.  Okay.  You off to work now?  No, I don't have to work today.  I'm off.  I switched.  Oh.  I was supposed to not work yesterday, but my boss had a meeting and didn't be there.  Care, care, care, care.  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  Thanks, Patty.  Take care.  There she goes with the headphones.  Thank you very much, and we'll see you soon. 
[02:52:30]  If you could just walk that way to the door.  There she goes.  There goes Patty.  Bye.  Bye, Patty.  Bye.  She's walking away, and there she goes.  Oh, Patty.  Did she hear you?  No.  There she goes.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What a mess.  Jimmy, what's wrong?  I can't tell you how much I just hated her. 
[02:53:00]  I know.  I hated her.  Why?  I don't know why.  Just looking at her, I wanted to bite her.  I never hate Patty.  Bite her face.  There's just something about that dumb laugh that was making me physically ill.  Patty, why'd you come back?  What are you doing?  Because they were waving for me to come back in through the window.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, I think they were waving goodbye.  No, they were going like this.  All right.  They didn't come in.  Jimmy said he hates you today.  Yeah, I don't know why.  I never hate you, but today I just, oh. 
[02:53:30]  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, look how dejected she looks.  Look at that face.  I'm not sure.  Patty, what did you do to Jimmy that he hates you?  I didn't do anything to him.  No, she didn't do anything to me.  I just, as she's sitting there talking, I just couldn't look at her.  I'm like, I'm just hating her right now.  Why?  What did I do to you?  I like you.  It's irrelevant.  I don't know why.  I'm not picking on you.  I just, at that moment, as you were talking, I just hated you. 
[02:54:00]  But you don't know why?  No.  No.  Inexplicable.  She's going to cry, Jimmy.  She's got a little quilted sweater.  She has a tiny little quilted sweater on and her Paris Hilton jeans on.  She's trying to wear hip jeans.  She looks like a rape victim out of a Lifetime movie, doesn't she?  Like the perfect look for someone that's getting raped in a Lifetime movie. 
[02:54:30]  The one that just doesn't, you know, doesn't want anything to do with sex.  Patty, fight back.  Just gets nailed.  Fight back.  Don't let these guys say that stuff about you.  I'm not bad-mouthing her.  I'm not attacking her.  You just hated her.  Oh.  With an inexplicable vengeance.  But I'm not attacking her.  I'm not knocking her.  Right.  It was just a loathing. 
[02:55:00]  Because she, like, brought the show to a halt?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's just something.  I think it's that voice and the laugh and you're loud.  You're yelling into that microphone, which is hot anyway.  No, not hot.  Like, hot.  I'm sorry.  I have breathing problems.  I know.  I'm trying to talk a little louder.  I don't know what the problem is, Jimmy.  I mean, she's a loner.  You're like an old, sick shih tzu.  And she gets happiness by bringing Anthony and I gifts.  Mm-hmm.  That's all.  She had no one else to give a Christmas gift to this past Christmas. 
[02:55:30]  I had a Christmas list of personal friends and things, you know.  No, you didn't.  And we were on the list?  Yeah.  Aw.  See, we made our list, Anthony.  I think that's really nice.  Jimmy, do you think that's nice?  I think it's terrific.  I don't think it's not.  I think it's fantastic.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  I know Jimmy's only playing.  Yeah.  He really isn't today.  No, he really isn't.  Jimmy doesn't really play. 
[02:56:00]  Sure he does.  That's it.  You just look at Jimmy and you know what he's thinking, unlike Anthony and I.  I mean, I was so relieved that you didn't have to do that sensitivity thing.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  Patty, thanks.  You're welcome.  You are dismissed.  Take Anthony's gift with you.  Why?  He really doesn't.  No, you can do anything you want with it.  I just thought it'd be something nice to do.  Anthony Teller.  Oh, I feel bad. 
[02:56:30]  He's just sitting there.  Take it.  Patty, take the gift.  Well, I can't do anything with it.  I can't even return it because it's custom made.  Keep it in your apartment as memorabilia.  Sell it on eBay and get your 18 bucks back.  No.  Why?  Oh, that's okay.  Anthony could sign it and then you throw it on eBay.  I'll just be careful about the next one.  It'll be worth at least $7.50.  There we go.  $7.50.  We'll do that.  No, I'll just be careful the next time. 
[02:57:00]  That's all.  Yeah, you're going to have to think more about the gifts that you bring us.  Yeah.  I mean, well, I thought if that was the fact that you were fixing your office.  We're pretty much divas at this point and you really got to, you know.  All right, I'll sign it and put it on eBay and we'll give you the money.  There you go.  You don't care?  Look at how she's changed.  I'm just embarrassed.  Please leave.  Jimmy is going to bite your face.  No, I would never.  I don't even want to attack Patty.  I just can't look at her.  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Is it because you once felt her up?  No.  Yeah, that's part of it.  Yeah.  All right, Patty, you really have wrecked the show today.  Patty, screeching halt.  Thank you, Patty.  Bye-bye.  Sorry.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  See you later.  There you go.  All right.  There she goes.  Wow, Jimmy is.  You all right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  I can't mess with her.  I just couldn't look at her. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to attack her.  No.  No.  She's putting on her ratty hooded sweatshirt.  That's like a jacket or a coat that a kid would wear on a playground.  Oh, my gosh.  She's leaving all rejected.  Like Easter egg blue.  She's really sad.  Oof.  She just bent over and showed her ass.  We didn't need to see that.  She just bent over to pick up her pocketbook.  Patty, she doesn't even have a winter coat. 
[02:58:30]  Get her in here.  No.  I just heard the whole audience go, no.  Patty, you're going to freeze out there.  Where's your hat and gloves?  It's like eight degrees out there.  Yeah, Patty, it's cold out.  I have my gloves.  Oh, I know.  I have my hat.  I have a hood.  See?  Do you get cold out there?  What?  Isn't it cold out?  Yeah.  Where'd you get that coat from?  Some face you know on me.  No, I bought it from, I forgot the store. 
[02:59:00]  Rainbows or rainbows in the mall.  What year?  1978?  No, this year.  Really?  Just live in the, I wore it first in November.  All right.  Great.  Please.  What?  Please leave.  Thank you, Patty.  There she goes.  What?  Yeah.  Well, bye.  Oh, God.  Next time I'll bring some chocolate.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  Before you leave, Anthony, could you play the music for her, please? 
[02:59:30]  I didn't even want to do that.  I just wanted to get her out of here.  Yeah.  I'm sorry the gifts didn't go over well, Patty.  I don't know, you should have said something in December when I showed you the photo of  what you were getting.  You think we, like, gave it any thought whatsoever?  I said, I was, I even told you I was making name plates.  All right, Patty, it's time to take Anthony's gift, because mine's somewhere deep in the garbage 
[03:00:00]  can, and just walk away.  There she goes.  No, take the gifts.  Take the gifts.  All right, there she goes.  Thank you, Patty.  Please leave.  You're welcome.  All right, there she goes, and she walks away.  What a sad sack.  What a sad, sad sack.  It's depressing to have her in here.  It just depresses me.  I think you were a little hard on her. 
[03:00:30]  Hard on?  What?  Hard on her?  Hard on her?  Yeah.  Maybe a little.  She needs it, though.  She's got to toughen up.  God.  All right, we're going to get the energy back in this show.  She's depressing.  She's depressing to have in the room.  Like, you need a Xanax with her.  Her chest was annoying me, looking at it, and how it's just not there. 
[03:01:00]  She tapers off like a little, like one of those, like, rainbow ice pops.  Yeah, right.  She just tapers off into a cone.  Into a nothing.  That was the creepiest thing, looking at you as she was in here.  I'm like, what is Jimmy's problem right now?  I won't go after her.  You can't.  Come on.  She's too easy to target.  You can't go after Patty.  All right.  Let's take a break.  I agree.  I don't go after her at all.  I was just being honest.  You know, Anthony.  No, that's not going after her.  I don't think the gift is not going to be used. 
[03:01:30]  I'd like it on eBay.  We'll give her her money back.  I like your new honesty.  I like it.  I just, I can't, I'm not going to put that on my desk.  Why would I?  Let me sign it.  Bring it over here.  I'll sign it.  We'll put it on eBay, and we'll sell it and give her the money.  You know, it'd be great if you sued her for copyright infringement because she used the  Wow logo.  There you go.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  No.  Oh, God. 
[03:02:00]  She spilled my chips.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, God.  Opie.  No, that's my fault.  I'll bring you loose.  Stop it.  Now clean it up.  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.

[03:04:00]  XM 202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Now this looks like a job for me.  So everybody just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so guilty without me.  I said this looks like a job for me.  So everybody just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so guilty without me.  Yeah, na, na, na.  Alright, let's wake the F up.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out today. 
[03:04:30]  We know, we know.  That last segment was a train wreck.  We understand, trust me.  We understand more than anyone.  Is Colin around Jimmy?  Huh.  When was he supposed to show up?  Is he blowing us off?  Or it goes nine.  Like it's like nine four.  It's only nine or two.  So he'll be here any moment, I guess.  Yeah, but between that and the, you know, getting here and then the paperwork.  And then talking to Master Poe.  It could take another hour. 
[03:05:00]  Might not see him today.  Alright, Anthony.  Top ten songs of the 90s.  We were in the...  Oh, that's what we were doing.  We were kind of doing that, the top ten list.  And want to get right back into it?  Try to get some energy back?  I would give it a whirl.  Alright, in seventh place, it's this fine song.  What year was this?  Money on my mind.  Snoop Dogg, Gin and Juice.  I don't see these as any top songs. 
[03:05:30]  No.  No.  Money.  Yeah.  It's kind of low, bro.  There you go.  Thank you.  Get mine.  He just lost all of his street cred.  Guy actually had some cred back then. 
[03:06:00]  Now he's just the worst.  See him on those commercials?  Hey, when do I put in my fabric softener?  Oh, why?  It happens to all the rap stars, though.  I know.  They all just go for the cash.  What's his name?  Who was doing the Gap ads?  LL?  LL.  Yeah.  He was doing his thing.  They all start with some credibility and lose it.  Yeah, I'm from the street.  I was slinging dope.  Yeah, I was shooting brothers.  And then all of a sudden, hey, T-Mobile. 
[03:06:30]  It's like, what?  I think Ice Cube still has his cred with that new movie he's got out with.  Oh, my God.  I know.  The Cube.  What did Ice Cube do?  He's got that movie, which bomb?  The bomb with Jay Moore in it.  Are We There Yet?  Are We There Yet?  Oh, that movie's getting like a star in the papers.  That's about it.  It actually got a star, yeah.  Are We There Yet?  What's that about?  Is that about Jay getting to a phone and calling in a radio show?  Jay's had so many excuses why he hasn't called the show yet. 
[03:07:00]  It just amazes me.  Too early.  And then Jay's friends call Ben.  And, well, Jay's going to call tomorrow morning.  And then tomorrow morning happens.  Never calls.  Something came up, he overslept, or this happened, or that happened, or, you know?  And we never hear from him, see him, nothing.  He was supposed to be in Vegas, wasn't he?  Oh, yeah.  That was one of the many.  Yeah.  Where's Herky Jerky?  Get the Herky Jerky band.  At least I'll say about Cool J.  At least LL Cool J was never a gangster. 
[03:07:30]  I mean, you know, my radio was his big song, you know.  Yeah, you're right.  You know, I need love.  But you look at, like, Ice-T, Ice Cube.  Ice Cube, yeah.  Those guys are a gangster.  Snoop.  You know, they all, they keep that whole attitude going for a few years.  And then they're making cushy little fun family movies.  All right.  As Ben makes his way to the studio, that guy that did the Friends theme for Ben.  Yeah.  He reworked the vocals and calmed them down.  Yeah, but it's still for Friends. 
[03:08:00]  Ow.  Ow.  So then I'll tell you that you need to book some guests.  Even little Jimmy mocks you when he's got meaty breasts.  Your massive duty's always like the train.  As you herkin' jerkin' gossip, it's all crazy, looks insane.  Herky Jerky band.  There's no way you sit still. 
[03:08:30]  Good old green feeling.  As the shit starts to spell.  Herky Jerky band.  He told me that we're going now.  And there's no Ben.  No.  That should have worked perfectly.  He should be on the mic right now.  Dude, I'm on the phone, dude.  But he's on the phone actually working on getting guests for the radio show.  Did you catch him yet, dude?  Did you catch the terrorists?  Don't. 
[03:09:00]  All right, well.  He mixed it much better.  Although some of the lines you can't hear.  And it's to the Friends theme.  All right, Anthony.  How is Gin and Juice one of the top ten songs of the night?  They just have to throw in a little something from every genre just to keep people happy.  Oh, it's sickening.  I wouldn't put that as one of the top ten of the 90s.  No, it's decent, but come on.  All right, in sixth place, top ten songs of the 90s.  It's this little song.  Groove is in the heart.  Groove is in the heart. 
[03:09:30]  Oh.  Delight.  Groove is in the heart.  Groove is in the heart.  Yes, do you want to dance music?  Groove is in the heart.  All right.  This beat out.  What's up?  How many rockin' songs did that beat out?  There's not many rock songs in this list. 
[03:10:00]  Actually, there's only one rock song.  And it was the poppiest song this band ever did.  Fifth place, Anthony.  It's MC Hammer.  And you can't touch this.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's how we livin', and you know.  You can't touch this.  Look at my eyes, man.  You can't touch this.  Yo, let me bust the funk lyrics.  Fresh new gills and bands.  You got it like that, then you know you want to dance.  Yeah.  He wasn't singing this to the IRS, was he? 
[03:10:30]  You can touch everything I have.  Here, have this.  Let them know that you're too much.  And this is a beat of the gang touch.  Yeah.  Very nice.  There you go.  Those big pants.  That video was pretty funny to watch every time.  That's what everyone would say.  He could dance, man.  Those big dopey pants.  We're going through the top ten songs of the 90s.  And in fourth place, it's the Spice Girls.  Ah.  Remember this song.  I want you to shut up. 
[03:11:00]  I want you to shut up.  If you want to be my lover, you got to get with my friends.  Make it last forever.  Friendship never ends.  If you want to be my lover, you have got to give.  What was your favorite Spice Girl, Opie?  Ah.  What you think about that? 
[03:11:30]  Now you know how I feel.  Mine was Dead Spice.  Baby Spice.  Oh, Baby Spice.  I prefer it old.  All right, enough of that.  Actually, I like the next song, Anthony.  Probably one of only two songs on the whole list I like.  Yeah.  Top ten hits of the 90s.  It's the Notorious B.I.G.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:12:00]  Come on.  Biggie, biggie, biggie, can't you see?  Sometimes your words just hypnotize me.  And I just love your flashy ways.  Guess it's why they're broken, you're so famous.  Biggie, biggie, biggie, can't you see?  Sometimes your words just hypnotize me.  And I just love your flashy ways.  Hypnotize.  That's a cool song, though, no?  Yeah.  Ben's in the studio.  Hey, Ben.  It's Biggie Head.  No, we're not abusing you this time.  Well, I was just about saying we're not abusing you, but then that's it. 
[03:12:30]  Uh.  Train Diva.  Sorry, Train Diva.  I'm trying to switch your tickets around.  Oh, that's funny.  Well, Ben.  What is going on with Jay Moore?  I don't know what's going on.  How many excuses are we going to get why he hasn't called the program?  How many times has his buddies called saying that he's going to call on the show?  And why are you going to throw stuff at Jimmy?  He didn't do anything to you.  He's gearing up.  I don't like him.  Got a handful of poker chips. 
[03:13:00]  Huh?  No.  Yeah, what's up with Jay Moore?  I don't know what's up with Jay Moore.  Jay can't wake up, I guess.  I don't know.  He keeps calling.  Wasn't he supposed to be with us in Vegas?  Yeah, but he went to the Jets game instead.  Wasn't he supposed to call in a few times, too?  Yeah.  But he's never up at 3 in the morning.  Because L.A., it's 3.30 in the morning.  It's already 6.30 here.  He's got to be up sometimes.  I don't know.  I mean, granted, on the set of that last Kubrick film, I'm sure they were very busy.  So are we giving up on Jay?  I don't know.  I thought you were going to call Jay.  Why do I have to call him? 
[03:13:30]  He should just call the show.  I don't know.  He called once, and Danny hung up on him.  Really?  Well, he didn't call the hotline, even though he had the hotline number.  So Danny didn't believe him, so we hung up on him.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Girl.  It's one of Jim's friends.  Oh, yeah?  He's here to meet Jim, yeah.  Oh, okay.  He's a fan of Jim's.  Come on, who is it?  They're with Colin.  Oh.  But Colin's not here yet.  Oh, but Colin's not here.  Colin has people now?  Of course Colin has people.  He's big stuff.  I've never seen them.  I know his assistant, Ellen, very well. 
[03:14:00]  I don't know who they are.  Huh.  All right.  Thanks, man.  That was very informative.  Great stuff, huh?  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  So I'm trying to change your train.  That's what I've been doing on the phone.  Everybody's going later now?  I want to go later.  Train diva.  I don't want to just get up and go.  I want to go later.  Yeah, why would you?  And I don't want to go at all, because it's going to be a nor'easter.  Why would you want to watch great football?  Well, later might be better for travel, because the snow will be done.  That's why you guys were going to be, some of you guys were going to be on a nine o'clock  train, and they moved it back, because-  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Jim originally wanted to be on a nine o'clock train, but because of the snow- 
[03:14:30]  Nine o'clock AM?  Well, I stay up, so I don't care.  I'll just go.  I go and then go sleep in a hotel.  I'd rather go early, get in the hotel, watch some football, you know?  Yeah.  Instead of going late, then you're like, you get there, it's time to sleep, because  the show is, eh.  No.  All right, whatever.  I don't mind going at noon.  You know, this storm is going to be so awful that this is all mute.  I hope it-  Moot.  I hope it peters out.  There's nothing in these weathermen.  We'll probably get an inch.  We'll probably get nothing.  They're always wrong.  It always happens.  They really are. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  That was wonderful.  There you go.  Okay, train diva.  Top ten hits of the 90s.  Runner-up, Anthony.  Top song of the 90s.  Oh, I'm so excited.  This is the runner-up song.  Runner-up.  Which will piss off a lot of people that it wasn't number one, because when you hear  what number one was, you'll be like, out of your mind.  All right.  Excuse me.  Here it is.  Ah.  The song of a generation.  The only song that belongs on the list. 
[03:15:30]  Nirvana smells like teen spirit.  This song actually was history-making, you know?  The 90s.  You think about this song.  Not that stupid, en vogue, salt-and-pepper song.  It's a throwaway.  All right.  You want to hear the top song of the 90s?  90s.  Percy of Nerviana.  Listen to Kirk.  Yeah, Craig.  It's good stuff.  It's very good stuff.  Okay.  Thank you.  You ready for this? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Number one.  Top song of the 90s.  A little band called Ace of Bass.  Oh, no.  All That She Wants.  Remember this awful thing?  Of course.  This is the top song of the 90s?  Who voted on this?  Whoever it is right now, they should be taking a cocktail and losing weight.  She's gone tomorrow, but all that she wants is another baby, yeah. 
[03:16:30]  This is awful.  This isn't even like their big hit.  Yeah.  What?  It's a big hit.  It is?  It is?  Now, this is horrible.  Ben has given me a note, and it says, Derek found a song that should be on the list.  Oh, oh, oh, he's trying. 
[03:17:00]  He's trying for a comeback.  Is our intern trying to do bits today?  All right, Derek.  Should we put on our laughing hats?  Brush it, brush it, brush it, brush it, brush it, brush it, your teeth.  I'll put back on front, bottom, in the mood.  We have a brush.  The old teeth.  That's a good one.  Wow.  Brush.  The old teeth.  Eric, comment.  Yeah.  Ascension in the ranks.  Eric, you're going to allow the interns to make fun of you? 
[03:17:30]  This was an intern request here.  Comment, Eric?  No.  He was trying for a job here.  Oh.  Oof.  But Eric has so much pull in the company that he's going to keep that from happening, you.  You don't even have enough pull to go to Washington with us.  You wasn't going to try for a job here.  Yeah, Eric, your job.  But I'm going to put my foot down and tell Washington not to hire him.  Call him up and just tell him you have the first same name as Logan. 
[03:18:00]  Wow, that was pretty cocky.  That was.  What could you possibly do to prevent him being hired?  Probably not a thing.  Yeah.  I've got nothing.  No pull here.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  You're not going to walk?  Maybe we could have Derek, Eric's, blow his breath on Derek's nose and see how Eric's  breath is today.  And, you know, that could be some sort of payback.  Car crash.  Maybe if he didn't restart it four times. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, my God.  He hurts and jerked his tongue.  He was too busy making sure he didn't say I got something funny.  At least I didn't say that.  How long has Mel Tillis been the producer of this radio show?  I'm honestly, I can't believe it.  Maybe if Derek, Eric, or Derek, Eric, could blow his horn like, man, Dinah, man.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Biggie head. 
[03:19:00]  Love the Ben.  Biggie biggie head.  Who just doesn't love Ben?  You have to.  He's the best.  I cannot wait to hang out.  That's why I want to get there early, too, on Sunday.  Yeah.  You're going to be there, right, Ben?  Yeah.  What time is going down?  He's not answering you.  No, I don't blame him.  But how cool is it that I hang out in a bar with Ben when a football game's on?  It's great.  All right.  I'll go down early.  Jesus.  All right.  I'll go down early.  We have the bad Bush song that you liked, hated, whatever. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, this is awful.  This is like typical hack type radio, like the safe radio.  Look, it's topical.  Dude, I know this show's bad today, but Jesus, relax.  Oh, I hate this.  Listen to a little bit of it earlier.  Oh, the song.  Yeah, the song.  Okay.  Not like this.  Is this a parody, this song?  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, it's one of those, listen how safe it is and... 
[03:20:00]  Do you swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution?  You betcha.  Yes, I'm coming back to serve a second term.  This time I won the national election.  Oh, thanks to you, Ohio, and your brother Jebediah.  We get four more years to rule in Washington.  Good God, he's coming back to serve a second term.  Wacky sound effect.  We were hoping in 04 we'd get a turn. 
[03:20:30]  But we lost the vicious battle.  Now they're stuck without a paddle.  Who will save us from conservatism?  I will stabilize to rack him a second term.  Everybody.  And I will amend the cost to she young.  Then I'll eliminate the taxes that are breaking all our vaxxers.  And push for more privatization.  We cannot believe he won a second term. 
[03:21:00]  He destroyed the Transatlantic Alliance.  Heck, I'll extend a friendly offer.  Barbecue and beers and Crawford.  Mending fences broken by preemption.  We want peace on earth throughout his second term.  We want Iraqis to have free elections.  There's a beef here.  Let's dispatch it.  And bury that old hatchet.  Yes, we've been through stormy weather.  Now it's time to walk together.  Gather round the old chuck wagon. 
[03:21:30]  It's a grand time we'll be having.  In the four years I have left in Washington.  Yee-haw!  The guy that sang that should be assassinated.  Yeah.  That is horrid.  And he should, talking about the war in Iraq, he should try to rhyme the fact that the real radical Islamic hatred of the United States started in the late 70s when Jimmy Carter gave sanction to the Shah of Iran.  Why don't you mention that, you liberal douchebag? 
[03:22:00]  God, I hate the left.  It's not like you needed to find something that rhymed with it.  Yeah, exactly.  For the rest of the song.  Mini confusion!  That's horrible.  Where'd that come from?  Anyone?  The website, jibjab.com.  Oh, yeah.  Funny name, jibjab.  They had like one big thing that got very popular when the election was going on.  When the, yeah, the election was going on.  Well, then we got the John Ashcroft song.  A John Ashcroft song?  Oh, you haven't heard this thing?  That's relevant.  Topical. 
[03:22:30]  Would it have been light another match?  Why?  It smells like it.  Ben's thing today is just lighting matches.  Yeah, Ben's thing today is just lighting matches.  Because I had them in my pocket.  I was in the office and I was like, is something burning?  And Ben's like, ah!  Stuff's laughing.  I was like, no, Ben's lighting matches for some reason.  He must be cutting gassers.  I bet you Ben is farting.  Oh, and he's embarrassed by it.  Yeah.  That's big duty back in kindergarten.  Yeah, he can't help it.  He would make little stinkies.  Big duty and little stinkies.  And they would make fun of him and he would be embarrassed.  Yeah.  So now he's affected by that. 
[03:23:00]  So he lights matches to cover it up.  It was probably a running joke in kindergarten.  Oh, Ben.  The teacher.  Call him Lil Stinky Ben.  Let the eagles soar.  Oh, that is John Ashcroft.  Like she's never soared before.  Now, is this a goof?  I'm not even trying to play.  That's actually John Ashcroft singing.  No, I understand it's John Ashcroft, but is this supposed to be a goof or does he really  think he has a good singing voice?  Yeah, because John Ashcroft is known for his goofing. 
[03:23:30]  Good point.  Well, maybe he was trying to show that he has a sense of humor or something.  I don't know.  Oh, he is absolutely serious.  He wrote this song, too.  This sounds like something that should have been on American Idol the last couple nights.  Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum.  Oh, from Rocky Coast to Golden Shore.  Absolutely awful.  Let the mighty eagles soar.  Wait, he performed this yesterday during the inauguration?  No, they had another professional singer covering his song live at the inauguration. 
[03:24:00]  He wrote it.  He performed this like a few months ago.  Yeah.  At some party.  Yeah, at a party.  He got up to the podium mic and...  Whoa!  And I guess somebody did it?  They had a professional voice singer there.  Voice singer?  Professional singer there who covered it yesterday at the inauguration.  Thank you.  A special singer that has a voice is what you're trying to say?  Soar with healing in her wings  As the land beneath her sings 
[03:24:30]  Only God, no other kings  Let the mighty eagles soar  And he goose-stepped off stage.  Hey, Eric, who's the hand-penised in that?  Do you know?  And then here's a professional singing the same song yesterday at the inauguration. 
[03:25:00]  Just a piece.  This eagles' place is in the sky  Sounds like hemp!  She's still got a lot of flying to do  And you can see it in her eye  Though she's cried a bit o'er what we put her through  She's soared above the lifted lamp that guards sweet freedom's door 
[03:25:30]  Through the deers and damps and watch fires  Of a nation torn by war  Oh, she's not about to die  You can see it in her eye  She's not yet begun to fly  It's time to let that mighty eagle soar once more  It's just an awful song  Wow  Not quite a songwriter, is he? 
[03:26:00]  Patriotic drivel  Cover up some more statue boobs, you idiot  Yeah  He really is a dirtbag  Oh, yeah  Did you guys hear the F-Bush on CNN?  Nope, haven't heard that either  Well, I guess we should warn people the F-word is coming  It's time to just add the F-word to the English language  Well, this was on CNN, so it's news  Well, every day, you know, the FCC is uptight about it  Somebody else using the F-word  And, you know, I'm sure there'll be something going on with this 
[03:26:30]  There's a protester just shouting F-Bush over and over again on CNN  People very upset when their children hear that word  Like they never hear it around the house  Just a word that everyone has heard, no matter how old you are  When daddy yells it at mommy  Sitting there at home  You effing bitch  When she spills the coffee in the restaurant  Anthony, some people had a happy childhood  I had a happy childhood, but I definitely heard some cursing 
[03:27:00]  What, parents never argued?  I remember a plate of spaghetti being thrown at a wall near a telephone  Sticks in my head  Yeah, mother  Pop just threw this thing  It's stuck and we're all  The kids are just horrified  Sitting at the table, quiet  Watching the spaghetti slowly fall off the wall  Smear down  Yeah  As their argument goes flying into like another room  And you hear the mumble  As we're just silently 
[03:27:30]  Watching the spaghetti  Roll down the wall with the sauce  And as my stomach goes from hungry little kid eating his spaghetti  To nauseous little knot of anger and anxiety  Thanks mom and dad  Did a bang up job there  Something like that happened growing up  I remember my parents were arguing over the steak  And my father goes  You're going to bite me about a steak?  And he tipped over the table  And my mother's like  Trying to give him carrots  He's like  You called those carrots?  Then my uncle came over and they left 
[03:28:00]  And she's yelling  Suck him baby  Suck him you queer  Out the window  Sure  Yeah, sure  Happens to all of us  They just don't know what they're doing  With that arguing stuff  Parents  Ladies and gentlemen  Just when you thought the show couldn't get any worse  Uh-huh  It's Lady Di  Ah  Lady Di  Hey, how you doing Opie?  Hey, everything's fine  Everything  Get Colin in here to save the show  Hey, Lady Di  What?  Yes  Why are you breathing so heavy? 
[03:28:30]  I'm not breathing heavy  I'm not breathing heavy at all  What are you talking about?  I have to put napkins  Can we make this quick?  In the napkin holder  I've got to take the underwear model from the 1940s  Are you there?  Oh  From the 40s  Okay, so  Lady Di  Lady Di  What?  Colin  It's like we never left  We have Lady Di on the phone  Yeah  Colin quit the studio  He hates to  Well, no  He actually likes to retire  Laverne Shirley  I'm very obsessed with him  Yeah  First time they were in those  Margarita Villa shirts  But now there's been updates and stuff 
[03:29:00]  They really don't like each other anymore  Oh  Lady Di here  Oh, Anthony  Shut up, shut up  Shut up  And let me talk to Colin  Alright, go ahead  Lady Di is  What?  Oh my God  Do you want to reach through the phone  And just choke any bit of worthless life out of her body?  I do  When someone's an alcoholic  It's very rare that I actually root for the disease  Okay  Yeah  Lady Di, shut up  I wanted to say hi to Colin 
[03:29:30]  I don't care what you want  Please shut up while I explain to Colin what's been going on  Lady Di now lives in an apartment  She needs roommates because she's got no job  She can't pay the rent  You know, I can barely hear you guys  Her son has been now living with her father  Because she can't support her own children  She says she's looking for a job  But she's a compulsive liar  She's also a raging alcoholic who's probably drunk right now  On welfare  And that's, yeah  And the welfare runs out soon 
[03:30:00]  You know, why don't you guys do it?  I've been looking for a job  I can barely hear you guys  Do you see, Colin?  Why don't we get her in like Dr. Phil?  Wouldn't that be great?  It would be  Can we do that?  Dr. Phil could tell her to maybe replace something with something else  Yeah, he'll be like  You have got  Lady Di  Yeah, yeah, listen, listen  Colin  Yeah, try to do something, Colin  Just be an idiot and actually attempt to do something  What's up, Lady Di?  How you doing?  Good  How you doing?  Okay  But I can barely hear you guys  Can I call you back? 
[03:30:30]  Unfortunately, that's not the same on your end  We can hear every word  Lady Di, we asked you to call to talk about the Beatles  Okay  Alright  So, because you said last time  We asked Lady Di what she could do  Because she's looking for jobs  And she comes back and says  I filled out an application to be a waitress  Like she's, I don't know, 40 years old  You're not going to be a waitress  Okay  Somewhere like a high school kid would do  So we asked her, what is our  Shut up  We asked her what our expertise are  And she said, after a long pause 
[03:31:00]  That she's very good at the Beatles  Right  Oh  So we asked Lady Di to call in  To help us out with some Beatle talk  We had a story about Yoko and Paul today  And Lady Di, I want to thank you for calling in  Oh, no problem  Now, so, the father of your son  What happened?  Oh, we're going to get into that again  Yeah, what happened to the father of your son?  Oh, boy  Well, first of all  He was not living with me, okay?  That's number one 
[03:31:30]  And second of all  I really don't want to talk about that  But what happened to the father of your son?  We want to talk about that  Why do you want to know?  What happened?  We just want to know what happened  It doesn't matter  Did he or did he not kiss a train?  Excuse me?  Did he or did he not kiss a train?  I'm not talking about that  That was a long time ago  What was?  That was a while ago  What was?  Did he commit suicide by standing in front of a train?  Oh, I don't  I can't talk about that  Oh 
[03:32:00]  Why not?  Can we change the subject?  Did he or did he not end his life?  No, I don't want to talk about that  I don't want to talk about that  It doesn't matter  That happened in 2001  I think it was 2001  I don't want to talk about that  I think she's saying  Is that okay?  I think she's  I think she's saying it did happen  She just doesn't want to discuss it  No, I don't want to talk about what happened  Yeah  That's probably very  That's what I'm saying  Probably a very painful time  It's probably a lawsuit  Well  Maybe a lawsuit, right?  Yeah, it's a loss  Of course it's a loss  Teach you about loss  And I don't want to talk about it 
[03:32:30]  Teach you about loss  Can you change the subject?  Please?  Let's go to the Beatles  So he definitely killed himself, huh?  Look, I told you I don't want to talk about it  It's like Paul is dead, I understand  Right, yeah  She doesn't want to talk about it  Keep the mystery  Yeah, very mysterious  Is that okay with you?  Ooh  No  Come on  No, not really  Come on  Let's leave that out  All right  Well, thanks for calling in about the Beatles today  Excuse me  You didn't even ask me a question yet about them  How many Beatles were there?

Because he's an ass?  Huh?  At the Hammerstein Ballroom  Well, why that song?  Paperback Rider  Because he's 56 
[03:33:30]  That's that new hip song  Ladies and gentlemen  It's a crowd guest  Rich Voss  It means nothing  It's really odd that an illiterate walks on to a song about a book  I can't believe we've never  Rats like to nibble on those

[03:37:00]  What's going on, Colin?  First of all, it's great the show's back  I'm so happy  It's been a long time coming  It's so nice to have something to do on a daily basis  Even if it is more early than I would like to be up  Yeah, it is, it's too early  But we're here  We're employed  Every time you get depressed, Anthony  Just think about that sign, Ron Conkerman  And remember where you're from  Oh, I know  You ever watch that show, the show that's in Ron Conkerman 
[03:37:30]  And Patchogue, you know that Bounty Hunter show  Which is hilarious, family business  Oh, right, yeah, the guy with the mullet  That's your block  No, no, not that guy, the other ones  The other ones?  They were in Ron Conkerman  The mullets  No, they're not the mullets  They got mullets out in Ron Conkerman  I've been there  Oh, I know they do  Yeah, no, I want no part of anything east of like Great Neck  But they have a, their opening song is actually an ACDC hit  Really?  You should go out to that song  Are you sure it's not the Ozzy song?  One of them has Ozzy too  No, but that Black Sabbath song you come out to  Like you said, we all have our opening music that we come out to 
[03:38:00]  Except for me and all the other pros  We're just kind of  He was slicing you so bad  Yeah, I know he is  Stupid  Well, if you were going to have an opening song, it would be Taps  Taps  Yeah, because you're going to die  That would be funny if I was sick  No, I mean on stage, stupid  And it is funny because my friends all laugh at it  They're laughing because you delivered it like a sitcom expectation  How would you know what a sitcom sounds like?  Wow, what a slam  You're right, Jim  My goal was never reached  Shut up, you know how many sitcoms 
[03:38:30]  I gave them a sitcom idea and they didn't want it  Which one?  You know my idea, the new Honeymooners  It's the Honeymooners nowadays with me and Alice  And you know how he says, one of these days  Well, this starts on that day  I break every bone in her face  And then it turns into like a CSI  He's always threatening to beat her  Well, I beat her brutally  I love that  I'd watch  Big meaty fist going into a little delicate face 
[03:39:00]  Yeah  That's great  Yeah, well  Then her sister comes by  I go, what time is Bigfoot coming by?  You know, a couple of funny sick guys  Her sister comes by  Well, she's in a hospital  I sexually assaulted her sister  That's actually an homage to a streetcar named Desire  Of course  But, you know  I think the people like that  That's very, very good, Colin  Thanks  And then what else did  He was just smashing you, well  I smashed him for coming out to Black Sabbath  Because I realized  Voss coming out to Paperback Rider 
[03:39:30]  Is just as ludicrous  As this nerd coming out to a Black Sabbath song  What song do you come out to?  No, he doesn't come out to this  Look, Jimmy's all upset  Because this has happened to him in clubs before  Where they play the wrong song  Oh, no  Yeah  And Jimmy loses his mind  No, they get the CD  I bring a CD  This is sell out Black Sabbath  Right  Man, I don't go for this  I like Paranoia, but I wouldn't walk out  Yeah, what song do you come out to again?  I forget  No, he doesn't  What a hack  A national acrobat  Oh, is that it? 
[03:40:00]  Yes  It's off Sabbath, buddy, Sabbath  What do you think  Of course  Ozzy would  Of course  What do you think Ozzy would think  If I told him the other day  How you were vehemently defending  At the risk of your own life  You were vehemently defending  You know  The Stranger  And the rest of Billy's great soundtrack  His whole collection  Billy Joel?  Yeah  I like Billy Joel  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Shut your mouth  Just because he and I have the same booking agent  I mean, why wouldn't I like him?  Oh, there you go  He doesn't want to burn bridges 
[03:40:30]  No, that wasn't it  He really said it sincerely  I like him  I think he's good, yes  He actually wakes up sometimes  To come out of Virginia  And then does like five push-ups  Gets himself excited  So he can fancy himself a badass  Just trying to corrupt a Catholic school girl  I do like Billy Joel  Wow  Kind of puts you in a different category though  If you're liking the old Ozzy  Old Sabbath  Billy Joel  Right  No, not at all  Kind of like Paperback Rider  I love the Paperback Rider  But I wouldn't walk out to it  That's a terrible  At least the Sabbath song I walk out to 
[03:41:00]  Is a great walkout song  It's a great walkout song for the right person  But you  For me, I'm a big Sabbath fan  Quiet  No  It's not about you  It's about the image  Because when you hear the music  You want to see like  Either some hot  Like leather clad  Like Lita Ford  Not that I'm 90 years old  Jesus  Oh my god  That's the hottest chick  You could yank at me  You just blew the whole thing  By referencing Lita Ford  That really sexy Mae West  I know enough to know  That that's true  And now I'm going to shut up  I'm finished  What happened there? 
[03:41:30]  Colin, did you watch the inauguration  Or what?  No, I did not  You could care less, right?  No  I'd like to see those kinds of things  But you know  You can only take it so much  It'd be boring  Yeah, he doesn't  It wasn't boring  He doesn't have to watch all that anymore  Without Tough Crowd  Without Tough Crowd  I'd have to pretend  Were you a lot more informed back  When you were doing that show  Yeah, well  Yeah, I mean  I've spent years having it  Thrust upon me  All of it  Yeah  Now you just  As an L  And then that is  You know  I always had to watch  Oh, that's right  So now you're just not  Reading the papers anymore  No, no  I still read  Yeah  I still read  You read the comics  The raising form of the comics 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  Why?  What was the inauguration?  Well, that's how we met him  Remember?  At OTB  Yeah, coming out of an OTB  Coming out of an OTB  Or on his way to an OTB  Yeah  He gave us a tip  Told us not to talk about it on the air  We didn't  And that tip came in  Oh, that's right  And that was the last one that came in  My cousin  The worst  He had this really good tip from his cousin  Yeah, I was pissed  We were so late  We had to run back to the station  I wanted to play that  Yeah, he's been bombing ever since  Really?  Yeah  That was a good tip  But, yeah 
[03:42:30]  Things are moving and grooving for me  Don't worry  What are you working on now?  Oh, a lot of grand stuff  Yeah  Well, I got a couple of great ideas for, you know, TV type shows  Ideas  Yeah, just good ideas  Meetings?  Oh, I'm going to pitch them to some of the top network people in town  Yeah  Well, the honeymoon is one could be good  See, I like that one  That idea is great  Yeah  And all this retro stuff is really making a comeback  Yeah  Yeah  Making a new Bewitched  Oh, that's right, with Will Ferrell  Yeah  See, I pronounced his name right  Because I was on the show  Nicole Kidman, right?  Is it Nicole Kidman? 
[03:43:00]  I never found her that hot  Why does everyone think she's so hot?  Because she's tall and thin  She's skinny and pasty  Yeah, it's all thin and pasty seems to be the look  We're going for  The young version was really hot with the curly hair  I didn't like it  When that movie when she was on that boat or whatever  Her breakthrough film  Really, Uncle?  That movie when she was on the boat?  I forgot the name of the movie  I'm surprised he's not like  Yeah, Nicole Kiddington  I forgot the name of the movie 
[03:43:30]  Quite a looker  What's the name of that movie?  Anyone?  Anyone?  The movie on the boat?  Yeah  I think it was called Captain Ron  What's the movie on the boat?  I was on a boat  Poseidon Adventure  Nathaniel, you know?  Take the mic away from  Nathaniel?  Dead calm  Dead calm  Oh, that was a good movie  That movie made her a star  Yeah  But it was also  She was hot because it was like a whole undercurrent of rape and murder on that thing, right?  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on on the boat 
[03:44:00]  Yes  Where'd you get Nathaniel from, you know  A technical institute in Austria in the 1500s?  Why does he call himself Nate and join the crowd?  Actually, his parents call him Than  They went the other way  Than  And call him Dat Than  Dat Than  What music does he come out to, Jimmy?  I don't know  I've never done a gig with him on the road  With Voss, I did one with him  No, you had him warm up for you  That fan?  Oh, no  I thought it was Nathaniel  Oh, he didn't come out to anything  Nathaniel 
[03:44:30]  Is he an aspiring comic?  Yeah  Yes, he is  He does pretty well  I wish him the best  He does pretty well  Another one joins the group  Yeah  Speaking of the Honeymooners  The Black Honeymooners  What do you think of that?  What do you mean?  Is that coming out?  Yeah  Mike Epps  Cedric the Entertainer  What, is it a movie or a TV show?  Movie  That's going to be a movie, right?  The Black Honeymooners?  Yeah  That's a good one  I think it's odd that they're remaking some of these shows  And casting black guys  He's also doing back to school  Yeah, he's doing back to school  Back to school  But they're going to call it to school for the first time 
[03:45:00]  Back to community college  Back to DeVry  Anybody there?  Oh, what?  Hello  I said, is anybody there?  Oh, God  She's really getting a good call  I can barely hear you guys  Hello?  Yeah, hello  Saying I can barely hear you 20 times  Is not the radio  I'm not a pro, but  Whatever happened?  Alright  Dan in Ohio 
[03:45:30]  Dan, what's up?  Hey, not much, guys  What's going on?  We're hanging with Colin Quinn  Hey  He's hilarious, isn't he?  Yes  He's not Jim Norton  But he's funny  Attaboy, Dan  Hey, sweet tits  Hey, I was just calling  To see if you guys saw  Jenna Bush at the parade yesterday  Jenna?  Putting that lipstick on  Did you see her doing that?  Wait, which one is she?  Is she the blonde?  Yeah, she's a hot blonde  With big tits  Yeah, she's much hotter  Than her sister  Yo  One looks like the president 
[03:46:00]  One looks like the mother  She lit her mouth  And was wide open  Like it was a cop  And she was taken square  In her mouth  This guy's jacking  To the inauguration  Why do I think  He's got that on freeze frame?  His whole wall is covered  Right on her  And her dad's looking  You know, looking at her  And goes  Points at the camera  And says, hey  They can see you  And then she just kind of  Got all embarrassed  And ducked away  Man, it was the hottest thing  From the president's daughter  I've seen in quite some time  Did you whack your bag?  No, I was a worker  I would've  The hottest presidential kid's scene 
[03:46:30]  Apparently you've never seen  John John saluting  That guy's got a laser scope  Alright, we're going to play  The CNN footage  Footage?  Well, the audio  Of the protester  This went out over the air  On CNN  Yeah  Alright  Take a listen to this  If the president looks  Out his window  This is what he will see  These are some of the pictures  Some of the images  You see  You can read those signs 
[03:47:00]  Worst ever  A picture of George W. Bush  Guilty of war crimes  These are some of the pictures  That the president is about to see  If he hasn't seen him  Yet  If he looks out of his window  That's what he will see  And I would venture to say  This is not  If he's thinking at all  Of getting out of the limo  And  This would not be the right place  To do that  Bob Franken  You're there  Tell us what's going on  The crowd's heart  Being faced off  With police  Who are  Forging  Several hundred  Probably 
[03:47:30]  Closed to be  Closed to say nothing  Of all those  Who are in the court  Going fast  So what you have  Is a face off  But it's pretty much  A polite thing  You're hearing  Just from over and a go  It seems that  For whatever reason  The crowd has been held down  Some of the organizers  Are saying  One of the reasons  Is that it is so prohibitively difficult  To get in  All these people  All right Bob  I'm going to interrupt  You're having a little trouble hearing  It's very noisy  Where you are  Yeah nice cover up  Did they mic the heckler 
[03:48:00]  He had a clear audio  Than the guy  Yeah the heckler you hear  Does that surprise you on CNN  No not at all  That they would point out  Those signs  And they're like  It's all very peaceful  Yeah  See this is why  One of the worst bands  In the country  Was sarin gas  Really  Yeah  That could have been used  To great effect yesterday  Lob a few into the crowd  Bands  I think you said  One of the worst bands  No I didn't  To come out to  As a comic  I didn't know what he meant  I thought I heard bands too  Yeah yeah  I think you said  One of the worst bands  I'm like who  Bands  Let's not get into details 
[03:48:30]  It's really not worth  Going back over  Hey are you doing  I have a question for you  They're doing a tsunami benefit  At the comic strip  I told them I'd plug it  Are you doing it  They asked  They wanted to know  If you were doing it  And so you chose  To confront me on the air  Why don't you call my agent  Or have them go professionally  Instead of  All right  On my face  David Tell  Jim Gaffigan  Judy Gold  And Jim Florentine  A comic strip  Tuesday night  Okay Jimmy  Close your mouth  No I'm plugging it for you  Drop it  212-861-9386 
[03:49:00]  What's wrong with doing it  I don't believe in the tsunami  Victims  I'm against them  That's true  You're against them  Those and these  So called holocaust victims  Are hiding somewhere together  I'm kind of with Colin  On that whole thing  I think a lot of that aid  Is going to come  And bite us in the ass  Because it's going to be  Money that's taken  By a lot of these  Muslim groups over there  And used against us  Let them stop talking  To all marines so snotty  And maybe they'll get  A buck out of me  There you go  They don't want us  In their country  They don't want our military  In their country  Even though we're helping people 
[03:49:30]  Right  They think we're going  To stay there  It's not them  They're scared of those  Look how big  Abu, Sayaf  Whatever that group  Is in the Philippines  They're big man  Yeah  Big big  Isn't Indonesia mostly Muslim  I mean it's like  80% Muslim  It's mostly Muslim  The whole world is  Just awful  Yeah  You know what the US  Should send over there  Buckets of salt water  That's how we should help them out  Just dump it out of a helicopter  Like we're putting out a fire  That's the last thing they need  Oh  Well Jim's going to do  The benefit though  Right 
[03:50:00]  I don't know  If you get back from Washington  Now it's I don't know  If I'm back from D.C.  Shut up front runner  I was always up in the air about that  Is it appropriate to do tsunami jokes  At a tsunami  Who cares  To do them anyway  Yeah  Like what do you do  If you have a whole bunch of good tsunami  If you have a tsunami hunk  A hunk  I haven't done anything on it  No  You haven't done any tsunami jokes  Why not  Is this the new Jim  No  No  I'm just not clever enough to write anything  Yeah I know  It's kind of a weird one  Is there a way to tie in pedophile sex  With this  Yeah 
[03:50:30]  It's like how do you take the hotness out  And make it funny  All those beautiful smooth lads  Washed away  Take four or five years  To get another crop ready  Maybe you should go on that  And I go on to like a Beach Boys song  Oh there you go  Catch a wave  Catch a wave  Right  Exactly  Ralphie Mae was over there  Walking around the sex areas and stuff  Was he really  With his chick  We made the joke that he had caused the tsunami  Jumping in the water  But he was acting like he just kind of straight into the 
[03:51:00]  You know the sex areas of Thailand  Remember  We didn't really call him out on that  Yeah well if you're vacationing in Thailand  You're going there for sex with underage boys  Right  That's pretty much the only reason to go to Thailand  He was with his girlfriend though  Oh okay then it's totally legitimate  So what he's forcing her into decadent acts also  And then I respect that actually  Maybe he wants a young boy and a girl with him  Yeah  You know there's no other reason  People go oh no you should see the beaches there  Like there aren't 50,000 other beaches you can go to  And if you're Leonardo DiCaprio and Jessica Alba 
[03:51:30]  And you go oh you should see the beaches there  You might buy there in some like wild beach ecstasy sex party  But if you're Ralphie Mae  The minute they get off the plane they're all like  Oh you're a sex tourist  Yeah of course  The cab driver tells you exactly where to go  To get the young boy  Right he won't take you to your hotel  He's like stop  Stop the line  You know where you're here fatty  Wonderful  Fantastic  Anything else Sophie or are we done with the show today?  We're pretty much  Well let me tell you something  Patty was very outraged  She goes 
[03:52:00]  They really brutalized me today  Brutalized her?  I was out there in New Orleans  She's a bore fest  Bring in Patty's gifts for Colin Quinn  They're right there  She showed me  She gave us these things  Look at this awfulness  Oh my Mr. Slate  I need this on my desk  Oh this is what you can know  Opie  Yeah and she goes  I bought them  I bought them so you could put them on your desk  In your office  Like why do I want to have an Anthony thing  And besides my desk faces the wall 
[03:52:30]  It's not like I have this big oak desk  That when people come into my office  They see the front of it  With a nice light on top of it  You should beat her with these  Oh wouldn't that be great?  Just pummel her about the face with those  You ought to put it on your desk  Until Mr. Marshall walks in  And then you're caught  10 minutes to Marshall  She spent a lot of time on the gift there Colin  Yeah she did  We really don't know what to do with it  She has a good  Is that her signature?  It was actually not bad  I expected more of like a scroll 
[03:53:00]  We kind of threw them away in front of her  And then we kind of felt bad  So then we signed them  And so we'll throw them on eBay  And we'll collect about 7 bucks  Yeah now you guys signed them  7 bucks  And then we'll sell them  Give her her money  Because it costs like 18 bucks  And for her  It's like a month's rent  Over at the hovel she lives in  Oh yeah  Oh that would be great  Why don't you get her a hidden camera  And let her deal with some of the tenants over there  That would be psychotic  This is probably one of the normal ones  That's the problem  She is I'm sure  It's like all like  Who's this?  Much better these days  Hello?  Who's this?  It's Lady Di again 
[03:53:30]  I can barely hear you  So what happened to the father  I can barely hear you  What happened to the father of your son?  I'm not going to tell you  Then why do you keep calling?  No  Why do you keep calling?  I thought we were going to do  Beatles trivia thing  What happened to the father of your son?  I don't want to talk about it  Then stop calling the show  Because that's what we want to talk about  Well why don't you want to talk about that for?  You shouldn't talk about it  It's very sad  You know his last words were like  I'll bet you $50 it's a local  No no no no 
[03:54:00]  That is not nice  Imagine that you have to throw yourself in front of one of these  Oh no no no no  Just to stop that voice from ringing in your head  Lady Di  Yeah what?  Get off the tracks  Lady Di  Di  Di  Di  Di  Oh that fat body on the cow catcher  Appropriate name for that thing on the front of the train  That would be wonderful if it just slammed into her 
[03:54:30]  Oh we really stink today  Yeah  It has nothing to do with you Colin  We were really hoping you were going to save the show  Well I  We had a really bad one today  I'm not the kind of guy that comes at you know  You're not a good reliever?  No I'm not the guy that comes and just starts whipping out impressions  I kind of go with whatever the vibe is  No I'm not the problem  I'm not the guy that's like  Hey how are you?  Oh boy what's going on today?  I'll tell you  Yeah  Let me tell you about the ride over here  My cabbie  American Idol was crazy last night 
[03:55:00]  Boy  I stink  We've been struggling all day  Why do you think I'm so finished?  All day  What do you think Reagan would say if he were in here?  Oh  Well  Anything on Ashley Simpson?  I'll break up my  We'll just throw subjects at you  Ashley Simpson  Why?  What happened to her today?  Well the orange bowl thing was the latest  Oh the orange bowl  I thought that was endevical  I mean here she is trying like crazy  I'll give her acid reflux  Hey Colin  Alright Iraq  What do you got?  Oh that's what Leno did  Are you kidding? 
[03:55:30]  I wanted to pop him right in his jaw  Are you name dropping?  Iraq what do you got?  That's all he said?  What do I got on Iraq?  Do you have an hour?  Russia what do you got?  Russia  Oh that's horrible  Wow  Put on the spot  So what did you say?  What a segue  What did you say?  I threw some ham handed jokes out  It was like you know  You can't set somebody up with serious subjects like that  Right  Yeah  If it's Ashley Simpson or something  Then you would say alright  You know 
[03:56:00]  Got a little something on Ashley Simpson  And then you make that acid reflux slash semen joke  And everyone laughs  And a few people nod knowingly  Alright we'll throw another one at you  Rich Voss  His voice sounds like a tsunami  A wet  Out of control  Misdirected  Disaster  Well  Well  Mr. Parsons  You think it's going to be a lot less wet than it turns out being 
[03:56:30]  When he starts talking  Well he's at the right  I got an idea for it  Improv  You do  You do  One of your great impressions  And then I'll do Voss  And he'll do Keith  Oh that's good  Okay  Well Keith  I  You know I'm not a big fan of the black people  Believe me  The sisters know what I'm talking about  Ah shut up stupid  The sisters know  They know I'll eat the coaching 
[03:57:00]  Alright let me finish doing Keith  Ladies and gentlemen  You might recognize your headliner  It's not on revolver stupid  You brought me out to the wrong song  It's on rubber flow  Oh he stinks  Awful Voss 
[03:57:30]  I'm going to jump out this window  How much time do we have in the show  Oh that is funny  Yeah  Man I want to play the phone call from Jimmy's mom  Because I don't think Colin ever heard that  No I didn't  Oh that is a classic  Do we have time?  I sure hope the Pac-Man music doesn't come in  Quitting prostitution  Your mom took you out of it  She left me a message in my machine  This is so awkward  Listen to this  Come on  Come on  Hi sweetheart  It's mom  How are you?  Jimmy I know this is a little awkward 
[03:58:00]  But everyone's fine here  But we heard the radio show  We love it by the way  And you were talking about  Giving up  You know ladies of the evening  Which is a wonderful thing  But you know what  Dr. Phil always says  Replace something with something  So I was thinking  You know you have that nice gym downstairs  And you know just for like 20 minutes to half an hour  And you would feel better  Use that  And also there's gyms in New York  You could go  You could exercise
