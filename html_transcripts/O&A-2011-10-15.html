<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts expressing their tiredness before immediately transitioning to a discussion about the tragic death of Susan Hart, who was crushed in a malfunctioning New York City elevator.  They speculate about the circumstances of the accident,  Hartâ€™s state of mind, and the reactions of other passengers, veering into darkly humorous tangents about elevator safety, near-misses with elevator doors, and the physics of elevator falls, referencing Mythbusters.  The hosts then express concern for their colleague Ronnie Mund, known for his extreme fear of elevators, suggesting a Cuban cigar to alleviate his anxiety.

The conversation continues with another elevator incident, involving school girls trapped in an elevator shaft, with a detailed recounting of their panicked 911 call. This leads to further discussion of other elevator accidents, including a caller's graphic description of a construction worker being decapitated in a service elevator.  An elevator mechanic then calls in to explain the technical malfunction that caused Susan Hart's death, specifically detailing the counterweight system failure.

The show then diverges to discuss a fight between Ron and Fez's former producer, Billy Staples, and other staff members, referencing Staples' history with the show and a previous stair-related injury. The hosts then review an erotic advertisement for a hoodie before shifting to a video of people swimming dangerously close to the edge of Victoria Falls at Devil's Pool.  The broadcast concludes with further discussion of the Victoria Falls video and a movie recommendation.  Besides the elevator mechanic and the caller describing the construction accident, no other in-studio guests are explicitly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road let's do this huh hey good morning  everyone morning morning how we doing today god listen our our energy's up how are we everybody  weren't we all just saying before the mics went on oh god i'm fucking tired i slept but i'm still  tired mics go on and we fake it good don't we yeah we're the best fakers we already did about  10 minutes of radio i guess we should just turn on the mic soon as everyone gets into the studio 
[00:00:30]  let me start the show on time  well we had an elevator death here in new york it's everyone's worst nightmare or one of them  one of them well getting raped as it happens it's probably worse getting raped as it happens yeah  yeah sure that's a nightmare for the rapist too though if you're gonna see that's hard to finish  this is it's everything you think when you get onto it all there yeah front page of the daily news  her death trap like millions of us susan hart got on an elevator to go to work seconds later she was 
[00:01:00]  dead oh my god who wants to wake up to this today that's terrible i don't want to read this first  thing in the morning no hi danny morning morning morning morning uh so what happened it was on  madison avenue not too far from here madison avenue and and she uh she was apparently getting  into the elevator yeah and uh the elevator which by the way these elevators have had a history  right of violations right of being creaky shaky and lurch violations they lurch mr adams what's a 
[00:01:30]  lurch when they all of a sudden they just either go up or down real fast or stop real quick  and uh she was getting in she was uh at that critical point where you're half in and half  out of the elevator and the thing decided to shoot up with the door still open and that acts like a  guillotine let's be honest with each other what the fuck are the odds of that you think there was so  many safety systems you're halfway in the doors are still open and it shoots up and what are the odds 
[00:02:00]  very slim almost impossible very almost impossible right this would be happening every day we should  look into her background because she might be evil no she looks all like a nice enough gal holy  shit why did she looks like a nice enough person everybody i'm sorry to everybody she's from new  york for god's sake i'm sorry the kid we're family listening no but i mean what is it that's a  sucks to be you or uh that is a unlucky lottery because the odds of that happening odds of it 
[00:02:30]  happening you have to be halfway in the elevator you have to have an elevator that's all fucked up to  begin with but the door is going to stay open so you can be halfway in you know how many times  this probably happens where you're just getting into the elevator or you're already you just got  in right and then it lurches up and you're like fuck if i would have been in the door  and this time you know she was and what then she uh she was half in half out as it what as it went up  so she got basically she got squeezed between the floor of the elevator and the top of the elevator 
[00:03:00]  door jam if you would want to call it that and uh just squished right in there they said that she had  uh in an instant uh she still had one foot out was pulled up the shaft where she became wedged  between the elevator and the wall so it had a life crushed out of her so it's not uh it's not exactly  against the shaft wall so there's a gap in there but it's not big enough for a person right and she  was pulled into that and just kind of oh my god she's still on a foot out my thing is i've thought 
[00:03:30]  of that many times like uh it says here she's just kind of yanked up with it a fire official said then  the elevator car becomes pinned between the first and second floor it seems like her body is what  stopped the elevator oh my god wow that is some fucked up replacement shit getting on yesterday on  this elevator everybody's another awful elevator and uh i always do we talk about before the show  you put your hand in and you swoop never just get on i let the electric eye pick up that something's 
[00:04:00]  in the way of the door instead of that little like bumper sensor and where your arm would be caught in  the door if it doesn't work i go karate chop yeah you do the karate chop you go ya old school like i'm  breaking like cinder block yeah that's exactly what i said yeah and you say yeah yeah it was  usually open but this time it didn't open it just closed i said to the guy there i'm like what the  fuck it's supposed to censor you you have a worse story than this girl it's almost as tragic but 
[00:04:30]  literally if i would have just jumped on an elevator and would have just went down it could have been  mediocre comedian crushed on his way home from what is hell for everybody you almost lost a hang now  in this oh no i would have been half in and out my fucking thank god my good cock would have stopped  the door oh but that's every day you think of that when you're on an elevator like what if this  fucking thing just drags me down oh i always that's just it i never think of it i just get in and go  not not a fan of the elevator because i know if it plummets i'll jump right at the end and save  myself like bugs bunny did when he went out of the crashing plane we all know that works he jumped out 
[00:05:00]  and up before it hit and he was fine and then if it uh goes straight up then uh you're fine too  you just end up for a second like a pancake on the bottom of the elevator and then when it reaches  the top you go and then you're fine again fucking cartoons that's where i learned all of my physics  you just gotta time it properly yeah but who fucks around with the threshold i'm sure she wasn't i'm  sure i'm sure she was doing the basic getting on an elevator i've seen plenty of fucking babbling 
[00:05:30]  yentas getting in and out of elevators where they're they're oh did you see bob today he's wearing  such a lovely sir and they're standing in the threshold of the elevator get the fuck in half  closes opens half closes opens because they're just standing in the way i jump through that thing  like fucking like indie yeah like indiana jones when that fucking rock door was shutting i i make  believe it's a ring of fire oh do that you don't want to hang out in a ring of fire you want to  jump right through that shit get through it yeah man tried to get her too he made a wild grab for her 
[00:06:00]  but i it just he couldn't well then there's two people in the elevator so the woman just screamed  at her yeah can i can i can i just bring up the fact that um vivi 666 here is saying myth busters  debunked that anth what jumping up after the elevator why are people so thanks thanks so much for telling  me because i really would have jumped uh at the bottom of the the plummeting elevator shaft and uh i 
[00:06:30]  thought i would have been fine i would have been dead wow thank you for enlightening me on that  you dumb motherfucking literal busy yes but why after all these years do we have so many dummies  still they can't figure shit out i don't know our sarcasm is so cutting opium so our sarcasm is  extremely obvious at this point people can't figure bitterness is extremely obvious our humor is  extremely obvious one more dumb remark and you're bounced god that's dumb i do it that's just stupid 
[00:07:00]  oh my god yeah uh but there's two people in the elevator when this all went down and they were imagine  if it was fuzzy he'd have freaked out because he doesn't like elevators just when they're working  perfectly just ruin their show because this is all he's going to think about he's already going to be in  tizzy because of this new it's a standalone vertical transportation unit he might have to take the  entire uh winter off because of this yeah story itself is going to be enough oh yeah it's going to 
[00:07:30]  be i feel sorry for ronnie what what does ronnie need to get through today's show oh god what can we  get him what can we get him no he's clean man we got to do the right thing though what do you guys  want to stay stick around because he's going to be out of his mind about this elevator thing  like literally right he's going to be oh yeah yeah yeah it was so hard to get in the elevator today  it's going to be crazy oh what's up with him in elevators he doesn't like elevators no i understand  that one of his phobias details for the people out there fear of plummeting yeah he has a lot of 
[00:08:00]  phobias and one of them is is elevators he's always afraid that it's going to stop and stop or plummet  cut him in 32 floors things like that i like one thing that fezzy did say about elevators that i  completely agree with when you get in and the door's shut and you're alone it feels like you're  in first class it's like hey i'm in an elevator it's like first class i'm alone i i look at it as  a time machine yeah yeah because all of a sudden you leave your apartment way up in the sky and then  all of a sudden you're just in this thing and next thing you know you're on the ground floor that's 
[00:08:30]  fucked up it's just that's how long it took you might as well transported there if you did  you're not seeing anything change if you grab someone from the past and put them in that  experience the magic box they'd be like what it's a magical box that you get into we and you're  just coming out somewhere else we take it for granted but i mean you grab someone from the past  they will they would not be able to wrap their fucking head around that yeah for a while i'd use  it to gain sexual favors my girls oh yeah from the past so you're the magic man big stinky bush in

[00:10:00]  holy shit they're out of their minds watching that they got what do they call it on the paper today  severe stress severe that's gotta be uh i was asking ann how long do you scream before you just  stop screaming when you lose your voice because you just keep screaming you think you just keep  screaming absolutely i'm sure no one got to the situation right away yeah so now you got you got  a dead girl in the elevator half dead girl just they said she died inches away from them oh my god 
[00:10:30]  in a horrible way in a horrible way and you got two people in the elevator so that you got to think  they're just screaming their asses not like you're cradling someone's head that's dying of natural  causes in a hospital right that's somebody just being fucking completely twisted like a human  shouldn't be uh in pain uh in pain and you have to watch it oh boy that was a mistake that really  wasn't a mistake oh no i swear to god it was i know i meant to do this i swear to you too oh my god 
[00:11:00]  oh that's better no it's not  that's just horrific horrible it's a horrible horrible thing everybody's gonna be getting and  getting in those elevators a little more a little quickly today a little faster than usual just 
[00:11:30]  kid get past the threshold as fast as possible once you're in you're fine and they're listing  these desks these elevator desks almost all of them are falling into a shaft yeah they're falling  there's someone gets thrown against the door or they've they've been under the elevator it's  something it's almost never this yeah what do you mean falling like a shaft like you know  open up like you pushed up against the door and the doors uh like there's no elevator there  someone push you against the door and you fall into the elevator shaft seems like that would be  extremely rare too it is rare but it happens even when the doors open i make sure there's something 
[00:12:00]  there here's what happens a lot of times in these apartment buildings you get these elevators that  have an actual door like just a knob and a door and you have to open it up and then walk into the  elevator all right and a lot of times there's no elevator there and people are just how do you just  not even look where you're stepping and they step into the darkness and fall down the elevator  shaft i would never do a lot of people die that way there was also um it's like walking into a  dark closet when you just do that yeah i wouldn't there was an instance at a school the other day 
[00:12:30]  yeah or the other week where a couple of girls went in to the elevator shaft and again it was a door  why were you at the school walked in why were you at the school i was checking up on somebody's grades  that i'm very concerned about all right and these girls went into this uh elevator shaft yeah uh and a  boy came over and kicked the door closed and it locked and they couldn't get out and the elevator  started coming back down oh and they were they were in the elevator shaft watching this thing that 
[00:13:00]  potentially is ready to crush them and they called uh i guess one of the parents or 911 even or something  i i forgot who they actually called but it was recorded did they call probably 911 did they call  batman no no they were killed it sounds like an episode no they got him out in time but you could hear  screaming going we're gonna be crying wait they called 911 first of all what reception were they  getting did they got a reception at an elevator shaft what phone company obviously not 18 and 2  if i was sam i probably would have put elevator um uh uh shaft elevator shaft school girls trapped 
[00:13:30]  elevator school that's it then that's going to give you if you need an elevator repair to the school  i searched news no elevator shaft school girls trapped how do they stop it in time low how do  you down 911 and they know where you are that looks i don't know i don't know that's fucked up or  maybe it was it was going up and down maybe it wasn't headed right towards them the whole time maybe 
[00:14:00]  it was going back up how much room was between the bottom of the elevator and the floor nearly crushes  three girls oklahoma city that's it is that there's probably the 9-1-1 call on the video i  bet there is i bet there is i'd like to see it let's for a little while long  how many seconds eight seven six so is it fifteen ignition sequence all right we can handle fifteen  two but you know they're going to one lift up what you know it's going to get way where it is 
[00:14:30]  stop moving  hello  please lift up lift it up  i was trying to stay calm because i'm the calmest of my friends and i was just trying to calm everyone  calm everyone down but inside i was really freaking out twelve year old savannah  made a 911 call  as the elevator was slowly coming down the shelf 
[00:15:00]  help us  hello  class in sas ok  where are you  we're trapped under an elevator  i'm sorry  hello  we're trapped under an elevator at class in sas high school  classmates say they could hear the girls terrifying screams throughout the school  i started screaming when the elevator started to calm down  the girls first tried to stop the elevator by pushing on the bottom  that didn't work  the first thing i thought of was if we can lay down all evenly then it would stop it from 
[00:15:30]  all the way crushing us  but the elevator kept coming down  can you watch star wars  i pretty much thought that we were going to die  and  just get 3po to shut down all the trash compactors  under there  on the security level  on the detention level  my foot was kind of squished like this  oh wow they were that close  yeah  the floor and elevator may have been what finally caused the car to come to a stop  now resting on her back inches from the floor  the girl could only wait for help 
[00:16:00]  i just remember  closing my eyes  and feeling numb  and then not being able to move  or speak  or breathe  oh  and then i just kind of drifted off  that's exactly what happens  wow  claustrophobia  oh  my god  so she had her foot  just her heel  the space between her toe and heel was pretty much it  i would be fucking it  thank god  thank god it wasn't e-rock or bob kelly  no disrespect  those are some slender nice girls 
[00:16:30]  no kidding yeah  oh thank god they didn't have boobies yet  right  i'm claustrophobic thinking about that  isn't that crazy  i think everybody is  yeah of course that's fucked up  damn  you want to  poor lady man  i don't  this is too early for this shit  chuck red listen to this  go ahead red  chuck roast  oh  that's our boss  what a tool  oh i mean  chuck red  hey what's going on fellas  hi sir  when i was younger  it's so weird  because this happened in oklahoma city  i was like uh 
[00:17:00]  uh doing  labor during the summer time  and a uh  service elevator came down  and caught that cat on the back of the head  and fucking took his head off  guy or a cat  no he took his head off  he took his head off  it's a service elevator  for what a construction site  yeah at a construction site  yeah those elevators are fucked up  because there's nothing  you know what i mean  yeah  they're very very  it doesn't stop in it  wow  once in a while  i saw the effects of that  that was just  i've seen photos of it 
[00:17:30]  i've seen photos of people wedged up there  i'm telling you  everyone thinks i'm nuts  this is where those horrible websites come in  and this is why i fucking never  never lollygag in elevator doors  don't lollygag  there should be no lollygagging signs  but it never happens  this is like a  such a rare  i forget how  how  i watched a special on elevators  and people almost  who makes those  dude it was amazing  when they talked about how they used to  they didn't have those things called the uh  the governors  which will actually grip 
[00:18:00]  oh yeah  if it starts moving too fast  if it drops  you can almost not plummet to death  like from a 70th floor down  as you're falling  these things open  and wedge  the elevator  so it really won't  and there's grips  in the old days though  no  in the old days  it was a  lift fall  i don't even say old days  i'm sure there's a bunch of buildings  with the old elevators still  i bet they just haven't  even before these  those are probably still modern elevators  i mean when they were first created  i bet they had to  you know  put them back up to code  or something  some code action  yeah 
[00:18:30]  you can't just have people  going into those fuckers  we got an elevator mechanic  uh  this can't be good  oh this is my man  does he get it  Otis elevators  yes  hello  i got a little uh  i got a little one on one  for you guys  what happens is  uh  an elevator counterweight  is always attached to an elevator  and it's 40% heavier  than the elevator cab  when it's empty  so what happened  when she stepped in  the brakes failed  the weight shot down  and the cab shot up  so she got fucking  slowly split in half  oh  the weight went down 
[00:19:00]  and the elevator girl  went up  now gimme's talking  about the governing system  that's in the down direction  holy  right  the new elevators  have these things  called rope grippers  where if you over speed  in the up direction  it grabs the ropes  and stops you  from going up  ah  willy wonk  it right through  the fucking roof  willy wonk  right through the  fucking roof  what happens though  jesus  i always have a fear  of going up  and not going 
[00:19:30]  through the roof  i've actually had  nightmares about  shooting through the roof  and it's not going to happen  you're just going to hit  the ceiling and fall  but what if you're going up  way too fast  is it possible  you could hit the roof  no  yeah you could  well  there's no like  fucking spikes up there  like die art  or nothing like that  there's plenty of refuge space  and there's a final  and normal limit  an electrical limit  that cut power  to the system  once you reach  a terminal limit  it's not supposed to fail  again anything could fail  at any time  so you never know  right  you ever see westworld  of course 
[00:20:00]  no  no that's basically  what you're looking at here  so she felt it  she felt it pretty good  unfortunately i'm sure  it probably took a few seconds  right like  how did her  her foot was  they said only her foot  was sticking out  why didn't she just  get her foot cut off  maybe she was 100 years old  and didn't jump out in time  if you jump in  and out quick  as it's drifting up  maybe if you're  fucking carl lewis  maybe you can get out of there  but maybe you know  she didn't have the ability  to get out in time  or whatever happened  who knows what happened  there's two other people  in the car too  what happened was  it was a complete freak accident 
[00:20:30]  she had no time  to do anything  it was just one of those things  yeah yeah  her day was  because they said  it shot up  so that's not going to  give you enough time  to react  no no but her foot  they said her foot was out  I think most of her  was in the elevator  so if only her foot  was out when it shot up  I'm wondering  why didn't it just  sever her foot  when it hit the  elevator door jam  I'm wondering why  she got dragged back  up and wedged  if only her foot  was sticking out  you'd think she just  would have lost her foot  no I see what you're saying  like you know what I mean  I remember one time  this is pretty interesting  a lady had a dog 
[00:21:00]  on a leash  and the electric eye  didn't pick up  how thin that the leash was  oh  the dog was in the hallway  the woman was in the elevator  the door closed  the fucking car took off  grabbed the leash  snapped the leash  just about killed the dog  and pulled up  lady's arm  right into the door  breaking almost every bone  what an idiot  people just take it  for granted  and think it's  always going to work  it's always going to be  fell safe  and you know  there's never going to be  an issue  and you know  it's just a machine 
[00:21:30]  yeah but like anything else  I mean  you're going to get  a freak accident  yeah  the fact is  what you said  yeah  no one's going to have  a problem with elevators  in general  but you wouldn't think  a dog leash  you're right  but that's right  that's kind of thin  and narrow  yeah  surprised that doesn't  happen more often  yeah  thanks sir  thank you man  thank you brother  I wonder what  a former ONA producer  would have made  an Aerosmith song  crushed in an elevator  you think that would have  been a hit today  oh boy 
[00:22:00]  he would have at least  he would have at least  tried to get it through  you know  let's get us fired guy  that asshole  fucking asshole  now I'm in a bad mood  oh shit  oh no  all right  let me just bring up  Scott Greenstein  I'm good  let's bring up Scott  I didn't mean that  I didn't mean that guy  oh no  oh no  I so don't give a fuck  about Scott Greenstein  at this point 
[00:22:30]  I don't give a fuck  oh what happened  I so don't give a fuck  about that guy  especially twice  the guy that I don't think  has ever had a normal  conversation in his life  with a human being  oh no  I so don't give a fuck  about him  the only time  I hope you'll have  a conversation with him  is if Scott is  right in between  the elevator  and the floor  stand right there  just stay there  we'll talk a long time  I hope he's hitting buttons  but I don't even think  but even in that situation  I don't think  I've ever had a conversation 
[00:23:00]  with a guy  no?  no because he just talks  in corporate  fucking weird babble shit  and is not a human being  corporate speak  I don't know what it is  I've never had a real  conversation with that guy  I don't think anyone here  he's had a real conversation  with a guy  he's one of those  weird schmoozers  in that he doesn't say  anything that he means  I've shared pleasantries  you ever share pleasantries  in the hallway?  no it's the last thing  he said  the last thing he said  to me  we're at the elevator  it was the whole  Patrice thing going down  that you heard  and he goes  you guys  that special 
[00:23:30]  you guys did  was just terrific  just terrific  just terrific  I go Scott  that's running this weekend  he's the big boss  he goes  you did right by him  and that special  was just terrific  just terrific  well the idea thereof  but what it was  was it  it hit his desk  I guess  some kind of press release  or whatever the fuck  they put out  they love  press releases  right  that's what  but I look at him  like you're the main boss  and you think the special  already ran  I have no time for you 
[00:24:00]  move out of my way  I gotta get on this elevator  and hope it  works properly  hey Ron and Fezzer  was a huge fight  at the end of their show  yeah what happened  I read Twitter  and people were like  whoa you gotta tune in there  oh yeah  there was  Billy Staples  was in fighting with  oh shit  Zito and Hicks  what year is this  well  Billy Staples  was there to say  you know  why is he fighting  he's back  and better than ever  he's back  what is he saying  why is he fighting  he was kind of  throughout the show  asserting himself 
[00:24:30]  as the number one producer  and Hicks and Zito  were kind of  defending  of running  like you know  all time  yeah like saying  what I did  was better than  what you guys do now  how long has it been  since he's been on this show  he opened for me  the Count Basie  many years ago  and had a rough go of it  you're being polite  yeah but they weren't  giving him a fair shot  either  I think they were  just giving him  a hard time  you know  poor Billy  I don't even think  he got his first joke  out  and then they were  just fucking with him  I don't know  I have no problems  with Billy Staples  wasn't he afraid  of elevators  he's afraid of heights 
[00:25:00]  when he wound up  or afraid of being  on the ground  there's something  going on  some weird shit  right  he  I think he wouldn't  go in elevators  but he wound up  falling down stairs  or something  isn't that what happened  like he got fucked up  from that shit  yeah I don't know  the big fight  happened because  I didn't hear it  but I talked to Zito  their producer  after  and he said  that  he said something  about Billy's daughter  or Billy not  Billy being a father  or his daughter  oh boy  that's always been  a touchy issue  you don't bring up 
[00:25:30]  his daughter  why  I don't know  anything about it  it was kind of  a thing on the show  years ago  where he didn't  really have the best  relationship  is she an adult  or is she  at the time  I don't think  she was that much  of an adult  at this point  she's got to be  pretty old right  yeah  I haven't seen the guy  in 10 years probably  I haven't either  I fell down subway stairs  oh really  and it fucked him up  to where he couldn't  take elevators  it gave him like  a fear of elevators  what  if you fell down stairs  all you would want  is an elevator  I know right  I want to build  them all over  I think he fucked his head up  like he hit his head 
[00:26:00]  and all of a sudden  got this weird  phobia  put some ice on it  dude Chuck McGannelly  the comic  he'll fuck it  he runs up steps  he'll do 30 flights of steps  that's why he's in good shape  he won't take elevators  he's an ass  is there a reason  like a fear  or he just wants to stay in shape  a lot of people  are claustrophobic  I didn't used to take elevators  for a while  because like  through my equilibrium  yes  there wasn't a  white's only elevator  it would throw my equilibrium off  in the old days  for some reason  I just had like this  I'd get off the elevator  and feel like I was dizzy 
[00:26:30]  from the weird  every once in a while  I'll take the stairs  and I live way up in the clouds  40 some odd floors  I'll do all of them  no problem  you just want to do that  for health reasons  every once in a while  I'll just do it  but this is  people who are terrified  they'll be late for a date  because they won't  and if I can't get to the gym  I'm such a loser  I'll get off like  10 floors short  and then do 10 floors  just as a quick little  little thing  why am I telling you this  a quick little thing 
[00:27:00]  I just do a quick little thing  so there's a big fight  yeah  fight  fight  why is  why is Billy fighting  I think  Billy wanted to  maintain that he was  the greatest of all time  oh  he doesn't like  he's one of those guys  you know  he doesn't like  the young guys coming in  he doesn't feel like  the young guys are working  like he worked  why does he ever  come out  I'm sorry  why does he ever  come out  I'm sorry  why does he ever  come out  because he had this thing  where he couldn't  leave his house  and now someone's  telling me he actually  fell going up the stairs  oh that's hard 
[00:27:30]  how many flights  how fast was he running  how do you fall  how do you fall going up  he was on the moon  when you slip going up  you just put your  no gravity  you put your hands out  nothing happens  how do you fall  going up stairs  I don't know  that's bizarre  yeah  so he wants to be known  as the best  what coffee getter  no I think  he's really  he's big on that  Ronnie doesn't  Ronnie doesn't  really need producers  no  so what is he  talking about  well didn't he  he snuck into  the city 
[00:28:00]  by hiding in a train  on 9-11  supposedly  that's what he's  he's known for that  that's his claim to fame  still he's kind of  saying you know  he's super producer  of all time  how did he sneak in  he just wanted to  see the carnage  yeah what did he  hide in a bathroom  he said he hid in a bathroom  I used to hide in the bathroom  just so I didn't have to pay  that's a good strategy  that's easy  what is he talking about  he said him  I'm so annoyed now  I had to shit  him and Dave  he's friends with Dave  yeah  and saying that they're better  than Pepper and Zito  I don't know anything 
[00:28:30]  about Pepper and Zito  was Dave a good producer  or was he just a funny  on air guy  well he's great on the air  yeah but I'm saying  I used to see Dave  like working a lot  before the show  he had fucking stacks  of papers  I don't know if he was  doing anything  but it sure looked like he was  it depends on your definition  of producer  I mean he always had bits  ready to go  yeah  and you know  Ron and Fez  that's what they counted  their producers for  so I would say Dave  was a very good producer  I think Dave was really good  yeah from what I saw  especially when I used to  you know hang out  after the show  instead of leaving  cartoon character silhouettes  of myself through the door 
[00:29:00]  so this was on 57th Street  yeah  um  hmm  so what happened  he had a big fight  is it worth playing  or anything  I mean I don't have  I like yelling  I like hearing yelling  I'll just listen  to Ron and Fez  I just wasn't listening yesterday  I would like to hear a little yelling  yeah I'm sure you're right  to find like the end of the show  a little piece of it  how long was the argument  I think  well it was  it was brewing  through the whole show  but I'm sure we could get  just the  the real  the real meat and potatoes  of the fight 
[00:29:30]  you know what I'm saying guys  does Ron really  again he doesn't really  he needs a guy though  he doesn't need a guy  he knows what he wants right  yeah but you need guys  he likes a guy  that's good on the mic  with him  yeah you need  so in that case  you know he's had a bunch of guys  that certainly have done that job  you need somebody  that he could  talk with  and uh  you need  you know a guy to compile  to compile all your stuff  to put all this  a stand alone producer  well yeah  no to put like you know  I want to talk about this  that and this  and to print out the news stories  and to have angles on stuff  right  and to put stuff like that together 
[00:30:00]  I mean  is Fezzy going to be in rare form today  because of this elevator thing  you know  I'll be listening  I'm going to be listening  from what I've heard  I think this is  that's the first thing  well the second thing  what  sorry  look at the fat pussy  on this fucking  oh there's the one  you were telling me about  yeah yeah  where  like  where  look at some of the shots  they're doing  dude  this is one of the most  erotic commercials  for the hoodie footy  on TV  not as erotic as yours  and they're showing like  I don't see your pussy  they just showed like  before 
[00:30:30]  she was laying on her back  and she had a fucking  muff on her  where  I know  sorry  I want to see  look how annoying the blanket is  it's like  you could try to use a blanket  but  she can't cover  covering itself  everyone can cover their feet  with a blanket  the hoodie footy lady  is living life to the fullest  she's got you know  friends and family  and running around  and the blanket lady  is just caught up  in a tangled web  of humiliation  all alone  with nothing  but her dumb blanket  she can't cover herself with  she's working the blanket  like it's an abacus  she just has no way 
[00:31:00]  oh I do this  my feet pop out  my head's cold  Jesus lady  does your ass smell  if you're in one of those  things too long  oh no Opie  no  oh okay  they're wonderful  oh no  I'm talking about  blanket lady  oh blanket lady  yeah  yeah  this is the long version  too  there's a shot though  where the woman  is lying on her back  I saw  and she's in the hoodie footy  and you see like her  her  through the hoodie footy  her abs and stuff  and then  wham  big fucking  muff  Staples got in a car wreck 
[00:31:30]  that's why he's all fucked up  what  no I heard  Paul fell down the stairs  whatever  you can't even deal with it  or up the stairs  we all got problems  yeah  if I left paper here  that I wrote on yesterday  would somebody have thrown that out  oh yeah  oh boy  you'd have to ask  Sal  the good intern  maybe Sal or Matt  because I don't think Matt  would ever purposely  throw my paper out  if you leave Krugerrands here  someone will throw them away  see because they're valuable  I don't know  okay good  but yeah  Fez will be in rare form today  from what I know 
[00:32:00]  from listening to the show  I would think this would  very much bother Fez  well he has to get into the elevator  to come to the show anyway  so that's going to be  like number one  is going to be the anxiety  of him thinking  that he's got to get in the elevator  is he healthy enough  to take the stairs today  hmm  that's a long fucking trip upstairs  when the earthquake hit  the quake  oh the big one  the big one  when the big one hit  remember the big one  that hit New York  yeah  I felt that in the Outer Banks  yeah that's right  I really did  up here  Fez 
[00:32:30]  I didn't feel it on  in the fucking Upper West Side  I was asleep  I slept through it  no I felt nothing  Ron and Fez were on the air  when that happened  and Fez was panicking  because they wouldn't open  the emergency exit  to take the stairs down  because the earthquake  had happened  a couple hours ago  and everything was fine  why wouldn't the emergency  be open though  that's just an exhausting  way to live  I guess for an emergency  it really is dude  it's an exhausting way to live  I feel bad for him  yeah  that's all he worried about  he was very worried about  when most people knew  that it was just  it was just a tiny shake  and nothing changed 
[00:33:00]  no he really didn't like it  god I feel bad for him  Fez is  it's like trapped  it's like being trapped  in that fear  like there's certain fears  like if you know  you start smoking  you're gonna get cancer  but then there's that  that all encompassing  just fear of everything  everything  it's like anxiety  anxiety man  it's a tough way to go  it's tough  speaking of fear  I tweeted it really late  last night  did you see the fucking  waterfall video  that someone sent me  fuck yes  don't go  fuck yes  I think I gotta  what  I think I gotta figure it out  but I think it still 
[00:33:30]  would be scary as fuck  have you seen this thing yet  no  just go to  it's my last tweet  there Sambo  okay  you gotta see this video  man seriously  we were talking about  like videos that give you  like the heebie jeebies  like the  ones that I'm way up high  my favorite website  well there's an element  to this video  that might bother you  oh really  oh yeah  I watched a few more  too that actually got  oh it's on a video  it's called  Devil's Pool Victoria Falls  if you follow me on Twitter  it's my last tweet  so this lady's 
[00:34:00]  on a rock  she's 20 feet  from the edge  right  and she's gonna  jump in  it's the highest  waterfall in the world  highest waterfall  in the world  hey wait  why  1, 4, 3, 2, 1  action  just watch this Ant  and people are like  lame lame  now there's a black guy  who's a mere  what  I'd say 2 feet  from the edge  2 feet from the edge  where you would plummet  now I gather that  there's a little wall  there right  that's what I'm trying  to figure out  there is  they call it  the devil's armchair 
[00:34:30]  that's a pool  it's a pool right there  right  but they're a mere  a few feet  from the edge  that's craziness  if you notice  if you go over more  where they are  it's not violently  going over the edge  probably because  the rock is blocking it  but if you go over more  so you're getting  a little pool  right  right before it goes back  up and over the fall  so that little lip  keeps you in  and there is a shelf there  but why would you  trust that  who figured that out  is the question  someone had to  do it the first time 
[00:35:00]  they're trying to  kill themselves  fuck  an hour later  they're still there  right  but I mean  it's just horrifying  to see this  I know  the black guy  with those two white women  oh wait a minute  you mean  but the black guys  wherever this is  in Africa  wherever the devil's  falls are  yeah  these guys run  like these weird  expeditions  where they'll  make sure you're safe  like these guys  are locals  and they know  where to go  so you're not  going to get pushed  over the edge  they didn't fall off  the edge of the falls  but now they have AIDS  look at how close 
[00:35:30]  they're so close  that's crazy  they're so close  but they're so close  they can't even really  take a peek over the side  because it's freaking them out  but there is a ledge there  where you can see  you see her right arm  yeah  and they call it  the devil's armchair  I saw which  I hate the name of that  but  oh the devil's armchair  but look man  oh god  get away from her  that's not the point  of the video  it's not  you're missing the point  this guy's saving their lives  these dopey white chicks  would be dead  if it wasn't for him  oh my god  is that the highest waterfall  on the planet  I don't care if it's 
[00:36:00]  relatively safe  whoa  look at that  your mind would still  be all fucked up  now they're showing the camera  straight down  right from the edge  and you would just be gone  in that mist of  water rocks and height  but if you go over more  you're pushed over the edge  oh yeah  then you're dead  wow  we have  what happened  the last few minutes  of running feds  if you want to hear  oh god  it's a lot of yelling  what is he doing with them  see the point here though  with this  this falls thing  like when you're in a building  and you look over the side 
[00:36:30]  or look through a window  or if it's a glass  you know  floor  you know you're safe  but it freaks you the fuck out  I would assume  it's the same situation here  you'd be out of your fucking mind  you sure are trusting geology there  that the little piece of rock  isn't going to snap  right right  make like a little vortices  where it's just going to  kind of  suck you right through it  and over you go  and it looks like you could  easily go over the top of that  yeah that too  and what if you jump in  and all of a sudden  you jump maybe slightly different  and all of a sudden  the current takes you around 
[00:37:00]  that fucking thing  a little too yeah  what's scarier  it horrified me  whoever sent me that video  thank you  of being pulled  like I've watched  when you see like  Niagara fall videos  what's scarier  than trying to swim  and being pulled backwards  towards the fall  and you just know  there's no way  you're making it  and then  one of the people  I follow  pretty plus more  she's pretty cool  she goes  oh great  you had a tweet  that I fell over  a waterfall  so I wrote her  I'm like  what are you talking about  she goes  and she didn't explain 
[00:37:30]  enough unfortunately  maybe she could call  the show  she says  it's like you're  in a washing machine  I broke my foot  kicking out of the tumble  I had a kick  that hard  what's that mean  out of the tumble  you know  at the bottom  it's all just like  oh wow  and if you don't  try to move out  of that fucking thing  you're done  so she was kicking  so hard to get out  of that  she actually broke  her foot  maybe she could call  the show  when they go  over the waterfall  I've seen that  oh it's great  I hear the movie's great 
[00:38:00]  fuck dude  I got it on Blu-ray  it's so violent  I love it  because I'm too lazy  to go find it  somewhere else  if you bring it in  I'll watch it  yeah that is a good  goddamn movie  it's fucking  phenomenal  I love Mel Gibson  as a director  I hope he does more  that fucking sacrifice  scenes  oh fuck </pre>
