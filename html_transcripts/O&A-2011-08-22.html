<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton (filling in for Greg Hughes) discussing an article about Norton's altercation with a heckler and his girlfriend at a comedy club. Norton recounted the incident, emphasizing the heckler's escalating aggression, his verbal retaliation, and his disagreement with the article's depiction of the audience's reaction.  The conversation segued into a critique of media bias, focusing on how race was disproportionately highlighted in flash mob coverage, citing a controversial Nivea ad and comparing the media's handling of a flash mob with predominantly white teenagers to other racial incidents. They analyzed media portrayals of race in movies, specifically how white characters are often presented as saviors in narratives about black experiences. The segment included extensive use of vulgar language and offensive topics.  Upcoming guests – Bob Kelly, Amy Schumer, and Marnie Kinney – were mentioned.

Next, the show featured in-studio guest Bobby Kelly, focusing on *The Sopranos*.  They discussed memorable lines and scenes, concentrating on Paulie Walnuts, Phil Leotardo, and Janice Soprano.  Kelly's heavy smoking habit and resulting health problems, including coughing fits and chest pains, were prominently featured, along with discussions of his struggles with quitting smoking and other compulsive behaviors like overeating. The conversation also touched upon a past stand-up performance where Kelly used a racial slur.  Sexually explicit jokes and comments were prevalent, along with a humorous aside about dogs detecting infidelity through scent and a brief mention of Chip Chipperson's cybersex activities. Amy Schumer’s upcoming appearance was again mentioned.

Amy Schumer joined the show, beginning with sexually explicit conversation.  The discussion then shifted to her hacked Twitter account and the fear of offensive content, especially racial slurs, being posted.  The conversation remained highly sexually explicit, detailing graphic sexual acts, including a detailed, graphic description of a threesome resulting in significant vaginal damage.  Amy Schumer's experiences with drinking and tweeting were discussed. Marnie Kinries, described as a “wingwoman,” joined to discuss her services in helping men improve their interactions with women.  The conversation with Marnie continued in a similar vein of vulgarity and sexual suggestiveness. The show concluded this segment with a short Jerry Springer segment and a reading from a fictional "Book of Ted."

The subsequent segment revolved around dating and relationship dynamics, particularly men's approaches to women.  The hosts, Amy Schumer, and Marnie (a "wing girl" with a Penthouse article) engaged in a discussion laced with vulgar and offensive language, frequently referencing sex and body parts crudely.  They debated pickup techniques, focusing on honesty, confidence, and humor (often crude and offensive). Marnie detailed her “wing girl method”. Racist and sexist jokes and comments were common.  The conversation explored differences in how men and women approach dating and the challenges men face.  Jim attempted a live pickup on Amy Schumer, incorporating suggestions from others. The segment concluded with promotional plugs for the guests’ projects.

The final segment focused on pickup lines and dating strategies, including unconventional and humorous approaches.  Julia from SiriusXM's XMU participated. They discussed various lines, from asking about the bathroom to intentionally spilling things.  The conversation included anecdotes about a man nicknamed "Sex Bagel" or "Prince Nagel," known for his sexual exploits and perceived value of used condoms.  The show also mentioned former intern Craig’s three-hour elevator ordeal and promoted a contest to win a date with Bobo, including a $1,000 prize and lunch at Dave & Buster's.  Sexually suggestive and vulgar listener tweets sent to Julia were discussed, alongside a sound bite of Troy (the show’s phone screener) delivering an angry message and a clip of Jim Norton's infamous fart from a previous show.

[00:03:00]  O.P. and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show.  Great guests, great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hot, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened  to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to be out of your mind.  America's most trusted name in news, the O.P. and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Hi, everybody.  Hello.  A very good morning to everybody listening to the program.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show, of course.  Once you erroneously turn on this channel, hoping to get something that Sam Roberts is  usually hosting, which is every other channel on the platform. 
[00:04:30]  And this one.  And this one.  Sam Roberts, I guess, in for the vacationing Greg Opie Hughes.  That's right.  As they do on the news.  I like when they do that.  They've got to tell the person that is on vacation.  They've got to tell everybody.  And, of course, Jimmy Norton.  I am here.  The angry Jimmy Norton that has been written about in newspapers.  Yes.  Oh, it made you sound so angry.  I was.  It was accurate.  The only thing that she said that I didn't agree with was that the audience was horrified. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, when I read that part, you had a heckler problem at the cellar.  And you laid into the hecklers.  And the guy was being this passive-aggressive asshole that was coming back at you with shit.  And you just completely shredded him because that's what you do.  And what he does is be an asshole, I guess.  And they wound up leaving.  Yeah.  And they were.  You know, it's funny. 
[00:05:30]  Like, she started up this.  I think we talked about this last week.  But I walked on.  The minute I walked on, I said, yeah, I'm going to Salt Lake City this week.  And she yelled something like, boo!  Or whoa!  She made a noise.  And then I played with her a little bit.  And she's like, oh, don't go.  So we joked a little bit.  And then I think she got offended.  And that's when her boyfriend got mad.  So he was just talking the whole time after she left.  And I was nice to her.  Yeah.  I didn't call her a bitch or I didn't curse at her, anything.  And so I finally said to him, like, hey, you know, I think I was talking about prostitution, of course.  And I'm like, hey, we're doing important stuff up here. 
[00:06:00]  Like, we'll just shut him up politely.  It's like, I'm not trying to be too rough.  And then he goes, sorry, you're just not funny.  You're boring.  Like, the paper, and again, the reporter was in the audience.  I think she was seeing it actually as an audience member.  So maybe she was horrified.  She might not have ever seen that interaction before.  Yeah, yeah.  But she said that the guy said, I just don't find this funny.  Which makes it almost sound like I asked him, hey, what did you, why are you talking?  Why aren't you laughing?  Then I deserve it if I say, why aren't you laughing? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  But I didn't say that.  And he goes, you're just boring.  He was being aggressive.  He wasn't just answering a question.  And I fucking buried him.  Fuck him.  Of course.  Fuck him.  I was so aggravated.  Because he had that stupid, passive-aggressive smile.  It's like, I'm not your fucking wife.  Yeah.  You know, argue with me like that.  And then he goes, what, are you angry?  Oh, like, hey, look at what I did.  Look at the comedian.  He's all angry now.  Oh, shut up.  What do you think, you're 15 and I'm your mommy?  Yeah.  Oh, I really, really set out to show him the error of his ways. 
[00:07:00]  And I was saying that he should get out because I'm like, why would you sit there if you didn't like it?  Yeah.  And then that force, when you say that to somebody, that forces them to realize, okay, why am I not leaving?  I didn't say, get him out.  He's being disruptive.  I was like, why the fuck are you just sitting there then?  Why don't you just leave if you don't like it?  Go outside.  I wasn't saying go home.  I was saying go outside.  Be a man.  If you don't want to watch this, go.  Yeah.  You don't have to sit here and enjoy the unfunny comic. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And I knew he was only mad because of what happened to me and his girlfriend.  Of course.  That's why I got so angry because it was like, if I would have known it was going to be like this with you two assholes, I would have taken the gloves off immediately.  Yeah.  But it's like, you can't heckle and then be confrontational about it and wonder why somebody bites your head off.  But this is what this country is.  People are such fucking babies, they can't handle consequences.  Consequences, if you're in a comedy club and you're being rude and then confrontational, whatever happens, all bets are off.  And it's nothing new. 
[00:08:00]  No.  It's not like any new ground was being broken there.  You're in a comedy club, you open your yap, you're going to get fucking assassinated.  You should.  As you sit there, unless the comic stinks.  But obviously, we've all seen Jim Norton in action.  And wow, that can get ugly when a heckler decides to be an asshole.  I'm sorry.  What I liked was that she printed the one thing I liked the reporter did a lot was they did contact me.  Yeah, which they never do.  They never do.  They always say they're going to and they don't.  But she did, and then I emailed her, and she actually printed a good piece of my explanation, which I really liked. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, thank you, Trevor.  Yeah.  Norton explained, she's like, comedian Jim Norton went ballistic on a patron at the comedy cellar in the village who dared to utter, I don't find this funny.  See, again, from an audience member's point of view, that's probably what she heard.  She might have been on the other side of the room.  Yeah.  But it wasn't like, he didn't just innocently utter something.  Yeah.  I don't find this funny.  And then you unload, it didn't happen. 
[00:09:00]  It was a build-up to that point.  I've had that happen where you'll hear people talking, and you've got to be really careful.  Like, you never say to people who are yapping, what are you talking about?  Because then you're asking them a question, so they can go, we don't think you're funny.  It's almost like you can't invite that because then you've got no complaints.  Yeah.  But I didn't say that to him.  He just fucking said it to be aggressive and shitty.  And then he goes, the Opie and Anthony regular attacked the man and his girlfriend who talked during his act.  I wish it was literal.  I know.  You attacked him.  Just like one of those chimps, you ripped his face and balls off. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I was biting his testicles.  Bits and bums.  Jimmy just attacked him.  He needs a face transplant.  I bite his testicles, and then he taps my head.  He goes, easy, easy.  I'm like, oh, all right.  Then we got a long fight.  And to talk during his act, which they did.  But he had the duo bounce from the club Wednesday after blasting the pinstriped office puke.  I didn't really have him bounce.  Right.  That's another thing I read and went like, well, no, there have been people thrown out of fucking clubs.  But that, it seemed like they, you know, you didn't give them what they wanted as far as backing down. 
[00:10:00]  And I don't think his attack on you got the result he was hoping for.  To like, wow, look, I shut that guy up so he could take his girl home and go, boy, I sure showed that comic.  He looked like an asshole.  You shredded him.  And he was embarrassed and had to leave.  I think they were embarrassed.  They were with another couple.  And I don't know.  The other couple might have hated me, too.  I don't know, but I don't know.  I think sometimes that will happen where you'll say something and then you know your people are watching you. 
[00:10:30]  But I never, I don't believe I had them thrown out.  When I was saying get out if you don't like it, meaning don't tell me you don't want to watch this and then watch it, dummy.  Get the fuck out.  Be a man.  Get them leave.  Then he could have come back in and finished his drink.  I didn't care.  But anyway, it's a short article.  As a couple was escorted out, Norton shouted, I hope you get aged and hit by a taxi.  He continued.  And I did say that, but I said it in the videos of like, right?  As soon as you leave here, I think I said, as soon as you leave here, I hope you get aged and hit by a taxi.  Right.  Which makes it a little bit different because the ludicrousness of that statement. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, you can't step out the door AIDS free.  Yeah.  And then the second you pass the threshold, you have full blown AIDS.  And then you go, holy shit, I got AIDS.  Wham!  And a cab hits you.  But I don't think this is a case.  I honestly don't think the reporter is being shitty.  I think that she's just, she's going from what she remembers as an audience member.  And then, and then I said, I would fuck his girlfriend.  I actually said it to her.  She, she, she, she was just, I, she wanted to throw a drink on me because she was standing  there looking at me and I'm like, look, all kidding aside, I would fuck you.  And the fucking place went nuts. 
[00:11:30]  And I'm like, believe me, I would do it better than him.  And I was, as she was like, Oh, geez.  And then she slammed me with something.  Uh, I said something about how great my tongue was.  I would eat it.  The place was fucking going crazy.  And then she said, you probably have a good tongue because your dick doesn't stay hard.  I was like, you know what?  She has a point.  Um, so it was actually, you know, I actually kind of liked her.  Uh, and then it said, uh, and this is where I really liked this reporter.  She said, Norton explained to us in an email.  I would never slam somebody that hard unless they were being obnoxious pigs.  He was every passive aggressive mid-level office puke I've ever encountered. 
[00:12:00]  And it felt good to slam him.  I hope you get AIDS and hit by attacks here.  Obviously things that would never happen back to back as soon as a person walks out of the comedy  cellar, but it was fun to say anyway.  They were disruptive and then confrontational and they got what they deserved.  Yeah, that is what I said to her.  So I like the fact that she printed that because, uh, a lot of times they won't do it.  They'll just make you look like an asshole.  And, yeah.  That's my explanation for it.  Yeah, they'll say shit like, you know, uh, uh, we tried to contact Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Efforts to contact.  And meanwhile, they never did. 
[00:12:30]  But, uh, that's cool.  You were able to actually get your own words in there.  And she was a gossip columnist.  It's not like the Tracy Morgan thing where this is page three.  Yeah.  Gossip columnist.  It's like, if this is going to pop up in a paper, that's where it's going to be.  It's going to be in the gossip.  But it wasn't like this is being covered as actual news.  Yeah.  Which is not.  Yeah.  You know, who gives a fuck?  That's good.  I found it very funny.  I thought the tweets were, uh, hilarious that were coming in afterwards of, I saw a bunch  of people tweeting about the article of how, uh, the people with AIDS that have been hit 
[00:13:00]  by taxis organizations are going to be after you.  That was funny.  I wonder, has there been somebody with AIDS that has been hit by a cab that was offended?  Oh, I'm sure.  But I guarantee you they didn't just get AIDS.  No.  I had a lot of friends die of AIDS.  It's a horrible, I was worried that this was going to be like, someone's going to go,  well, he made an AIDS joke.  Yeah.  But, uh, I was too annoyed.  I'm not going to apologize.  I'm not sorry I said it.  I'm glad I said it.  The guy was a piece of shit.  He was, he was being confrontational in a comedy club.  That's what you get.  That's what happens.  That's what you get. 
[00:13:30]  I think there are too many people, um, with other bullshit things.  Uh, if it was the maybe eighties, uh, and you make an AIDS, uh, joke, even a reference,  uh, get in trouble.  I think you're fine.  And I got Twittered by a guy.  It's funny.  I was talking to this Brazilian comedian.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah.  Conan mentioned him in a tweet as a, cause Conan's very funny on Twitter and I'll check his stuff  out.  And he had said, I just found out and I forget the guy's name.  Oh, thank you, Travis.  Uh, uh, uh, Rafina Bastos.  I think his name is, uh, Rafinas Bastos.  Yeah.  Two and a half mil. 
[00:14:00]  He's got followers to almost 2 million, 900,000 followers.  Um, he's a, maybe a very famous Brazilian comic.  And he said he saw me at the cellar one night and I, I just, I just didn't know him, but  he was telling me that he, uh, he actually erased his tweets to me cause he goes, I'll  wind up in the press tomorrow if I do this again.  Oh, he's being sued in Brazil.  Like we think that it's bad in the U S but look at Canada.  He fucking almost got arrested on stage and he told me the joke.  He was very funny.  It was something about, uh, how, how come all these people, women complaining about 
[00:14:30]  rape are ugly.  They shouldn't look at it like it's an attack.  They should see it as an opportunity.  It was some really mean rape joke, but it was a joke.  Yeah.  And, uh, he showed photos of the protests outside the club.  He said he's being sued by 12 different people, uh, for calling them ugly.  Like he's going to go to court.  What?  Like it's bad there.  Like, uh, so it's not just the U S where everyone's being a fucking baby about standup  comedy.  Wow.  We're just doomed as far as this shit goes.  You think?  I mean, I think you're right.  I mean, it is, it could be worse in other countries, like something like that, but it 
[00:15:00]  is Brazil.  Yeah.  And, but, uh, but this country where you're supposed to have the rights and freedom of  speech.  Uh, there, there, there was an ad today, uh, just brought this to my attention, uh, a Nivea  ad Nivea apologizes.  Of course, you got to apologize for inappropriate and offensive ad that sparked racial outrage.  How much outrage did it really spark?  Was it a lot of outrage?  I didn't hear about it. 
[00:15:30]  To me, outrage has to be, you, everyone knows people are outraged because it's outrage.  It's outrageous.  It's outrageous.  It's where outrage comes from, Sam.  Take rage and you just, it's, it's out.  Yeah.  Rage outward.  It's rage.  It's all over the place.  Everyone's got it.  Uh, beauty brand Nivea is in hot water after its latest campaign has been called racist.  The, uh, Nivea for men's ad printed in the September issue of Esquire magazine shows a  short-haired black man hurling the decapitated head of another black man with an afro and a 
[00:16:00]  beard, supposedly his former self, with the slogan, look like you give a damn, re-civilize  yourself.  Now that's the ad.  He's kind of in a, um, uh, stance where it's almost like he's, he's hurling a shot put  or something, uh, discus with his own head and, uh, he's re-civilizing himself. 
[00:16:30]  He's got his old self, which has a big afro and a beard and he's throwing that old head  away because he's found a new way to groom himself with Nivea products.  And, uh, the whole argument is if this was a white guy with a, you know, a mullet and,  uh, a goatee or something like that and he, and he's, he's throwing his old head away.  No one would say anything, you know, but, but the fact that he's a black guy, uh, sparks  what I like to call outrage, uh, and, um, I, I guess they, they felt they had to apologize. 
[00:17:00]  Thank you for caring enough to give us your feedback about the recent re-civilized Nivea  for men ad.  This ad was inappropriate and offensive.  It was never our intention to offend anyone.  And for, uh, that we are deeply sorry.  This ad will never be used again.  Diversity and equal opportunity are crucial values of our company.  But you, you, you're right. 
[00:17:30]  Did you hear what the model said?  You're right.  The model spoke.  The guy himself, the campaign spokes, uh, supposed, uh, model BJ Williams, uh, posted online that  he wasn't offended by the ad, according to Forbes.  Can't believe I'm asking this, but had the man been white, throwing a white mask, uh, would  the media respond to the same?  Answer that honestly, he wrote.  And of course it's no.  Uh, there wouldn't be any outrage.  It just goes to show you the double standard there, um, on that end where, uh, whitey will 
[00:18:00]  just look and go like, oh boy, oh, we better apologize.  Oh boy, the Negroes are outraged.  Meanwhile, there's no outrage.  There's no reason for it.  Um, re-civilize yourself.  It means nothing.  The word civilize, I think it was poorly word.  Re-civilize is probably what did it.  They should have just re-fraged.  It's like, if you're looking at that, it's like a black guy with an afro, you might want  to re-civilize, ah, they should have probably just phrased it a little bit better, but I  don't think it means it's racist.  I think if there was a bone through his nose and a plate in his lip and he's hurling that, 
[00:18:30]  there could be an issue.  That's true.  But, uh, you know, with the big afro and the, the, the, the beard, he just looks unkempt.  Yeah.  Um, you know, hey, hey, this ad could have been me.  I could have taken a picture of me from the 80s, early 90s with my giant afro.  And, uh, beard and everything and, and doing that.  And, uh, of course I'd still look uncivilized even in the, the picture of me throwing my 
[00:19:00]  own head.  But you know what?  We, we always say that they don't mention race in the, in the media and I Twittered a  link.  I was incorrect.  In fact, uh, they, they, they did during, finally during a flash mob, they mentioned  race.  So I apologize.  Oh, they did.  Yes.  For all the times I've called the media absolute fucking cowards.  If any of you are listening today, all the times I've accused you of being just fucking  sickening cowards.  There was a rapper who called a flash mob and, uh, finally the media mentioned race in relation  to a flash mob when it didn't have anything to do with the story.  They did. 
[00:19:30]  Had nothing to do with the story.  There were no biased attacks.  They just mentioned race.  So congratulations to the media for finally not being cowardly twats.  Finally.  Yes.  Wow.  Let me see.  Um, let me see.  Someone post a picture of a shirtless rapper, uh, revealing a, uh, huge, um, MGK tattoo across  his shoulder.  Looks a little like Eminem almost.  Yeah, he does look like Eminem.  He's a white guy rapper, huh?  Yeah.  In handcuffs on Twitter, uh, fans soon posted videos on YouTube showing hundreds of people, 
[00:20:00]  mostly white teens and young adults gathered in the mall's food court, watching police wrestle  with the rapper and chanting MGK as the officers led him away.  So they're mentioning a flash mob of mostly white teens and young adults.  Yeah.  Now, why is that?  That's because they, they know that they've only been showing blacks and never saying,  and they feel so guilty. 
[00:20:30]  These fucking white reporters are so awful and guilty and copy editors that they have  to say, see, we know it's white people too.  They wanted to clarify so you don't just think it's blacks we're picking on.  Right.  They're so afraid of the perception.  You know what?  Silly.  That's ridiculous because every flash mob I've seen on TV and, and, and, and by the way,  did they steal stuff?  What were they doing?  Or were they just getting together chanting the rapper's name as police hauled him away?  Or were they in the food court, um, uh, jumping the counters, stealing the food and running 
[00:21:00]  off, not paying for anything?  It looked like they were just running around through the mall.  They were just, they were chanting and being, they were chanting.  Okay.  I'm, I'm, I'm looking at a video.  Was there any violence?  Some violence going on.  No, they're all chanting.  Is there some sound on this?  Yeah.  Ah, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  There it is.  The girl just jumping up and down.  There's a celebrity there.  Let's see a couple of hoodies.  M.G.K. 
[00:21:30]  M.G.K.  M.G.K.  All right.  There's some cops there.  That's, uh, security.  They just seem to be trying to keep him away from the throngs of people that are there to  see him.  But this looks like a, a, a mall appearance of a celebrity.  It's basically, he showed up, they're all like teenage white kids yelling and screaming.  Yeah.  Although, then again, the media mentioning that it's mostly white and there's no, there 
[00:22:00]  was no violence with it.  Maybe that's why they're mentioning it.  Yeah.  Well, I don't see this as a flash mob like we see that the shirtless rapper guy is being  cuffed by the cops and the white crowd loving it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  We, we got ourselves a white criminal rapper.  Wow.  Those cops, by the way, are up against the railing, like over a rink almost that you'll see in  the mall.  Yeah.  And they're not in any danger.  No.  Everyone just hold up their cell phone cameras.  There's no fucking problems.  Yeah.  But it annoyed me that they mentioned it when it's not connected to anything. 
[00:22:30]  It's not like there was a biased attack and they should have mentioned it.  No.  So you guys would think I'm paranoid and we harp on this shit.  And again, I don't see any thievery going on.  It's not closed circuit cams of, uh, a lot of people walking into a store and stealing  shit or punching people in the face.  Uh, and I did see a couple more flash mob videos over the weekend and, um, there, there  is a giant problem in the black community with these fucking criminal flash mobs. 
[00:23:00]  Was the race mentioned in the, uh, no, not at all.  Young, young people, teens, teens, young adults, unruly teens.  You'll hear all that shit, but never the fact that no one addresses.  It's like, Hey, can someone address why, uh, now I have to say 99.9% instead of a hundred  percent of, of these, uh, bias, uh, not bias, but, uh, flash mob things are, are, are black.  What's going on?  Why isn't this being addressed?  Why aren't any black leaders coming out and going, you know, except in Philly, the 
[00:23:30]  Philadelphia matter.  I love that guy.  He did say it, but it's like Halloween.  They go in with bags.  Now they go in like pillowcases and their own shopping bags and they go in and just  grab shit and run out.  And then store owners left to be like, I did not know what to do.  It was terrible.  This poor guy.  And meanwhile, if you, if you look at like, say a bunch of young black guys come in and  you, and I'm not talking about a fucking 60 year old black guy and his wife, but if  you say five young black guys come in and you look at them differently or what you, you'd 
[00:24:00]  be seen as profiling and racist and inappropriate, it's like you can't win.  Yes.  Yes.  If there was a security guard at the door and he denied entrance of 15, 20 blacks that  wanted to come into the store, uh, for any reason, maybe they just all wanted to shop  together.  Yeah.  Maybe it was a flash mob where they had mops and, um, and some, uh, windex and we're going  to just clean the floors and the windows for the gentlemen that own the establishment. 
[00:24:30]  Uh, but if you said, no, you're not allowed in here, there would be again, outrage and  race would absolutely be mentioned within the first paragraph.  And it would all be, here's a video of a pack of young ladies.  And by the way, I don't even care about the flash mobs that much.  It's shitty, but look, there's a lot of crime.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My fucking hatred is just the media.  Yes.  It's not even the, you know, say it really.  It's just the media because they're the same people.  And again, I apologize for belaboring this point.  Is that the way to say that word?  Belaboring?  That's good enough.  But we're the same ones. 
[00:25:00]  The media is the same ones that will fucking get us fired.  They helped get I'm in.  They're the same fucking guys.  Drives you crazy.  They only bring up race in certain circumstances when it's a bias crime against blacks or it's  white people, you know, flash mob of white people.  That wasn't, that wasn't what is now considered a flash mob.  Flash mobs, when they first started, were white people that would do dumb things.  They'd all get together and do a fucking, the thriller dance, the Michael Jackson thriller 
[00:25:30]  dance.  It's like, hey, let's all meet at this place.  And at exactly 8.01, we will break into the thriller dance.  Yeah.  And they should, by the way, be met by violence.  I was going to say, I actually find blacks turning a store upside down is less offensive  than 50 white people meeting and dancing in public.  Exactly.  Liverpool Station.  This is a T-Mobile dance that they're doing.  30 million views.  30 million views.  Out of nowhere.  They just decided to do a little flash mob thing. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  And people just start, like, dancing.  Oh, my God, this flash mob is crazy.  Yeah, they used to, you're right.  There would be people who organized and met in weird places with blue bubbles or did all  this weird shit, but they were not to attack people.  No.  And this is dumb white people flash mob.  Look, they're all doing a dance.  It's harmless. 
[00:26:30]  It's stupid.  That looks like almost a rehearsed dance troupe because they're all in perfect coordination  with each other.  What the hell are they doing?  Oh, no.  Hide your purses.  They're going to dance on them.  It's just silly.  It's silly.  But now when you say flash mob, you don't think of this.  You're thinking of, because look at how well this is recorded, too.  Yeah.  Multi-camera shoot on the floor, down the escalator, on the balcony.  But there's only one view of the new flash mob, and that is through security cameras. 
[00:27:00]  And by the way, this is obviously because the music is playing over the PA.  Yeah.  So this is obviously a coordinated event.  Coordinated event.  So you think Howie Mandel's special that he tried to do where he was organizing flash  mobs would be totally different now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Than a year ago when he did it?  It would be hilarious just watching Howie Mandel in blackface running through a store  stealing stuff.  But not touching anything because he doesn't want to get his hands dirty?  No.  That lunatic.  Pointing at stuff.  Could you take that for me? 
[00:27:30]  Could you take that for me?  Blackface and white gloves on.  Yes.  Yeah.  You look at cartoons from 1910.  Yeah.  I forgot about Howie Mandel fucking wanting to do that.  Want to do the flash mob show.  A couple got married via flash mob on his show.  They did.  Nothing got stolen.  They had a wedding.  That's crazy.  You need stuff to be stolen now for it to be a flash mob.  Flash mob.  The word mob is now more important than the flash part.  It's just now a mob of people walking in and stealing things. 
[00:28:00]  Do you think people are here?  It's like I feel like people do hear this.  Like I get a lot of Twitters from people.  I think that actually that tweet that I sent was from somebody who sent it to me.  Like I think are people I feel like people hopefully are listening and getting this because you feel like you're just alone in a room yelling it and you're crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You feel like you're just over and over again saying the same thing and no one's listening to you.  But but then you watch the news and realize no one's listening.  They they this has to be brought up as an issue even just to ask the question.  Why is this happening in the black community leaders like like the mayor in Philly that actually brought it up and said knock it off. 
[00:28:30]  You're you know you're hurting your own people.  You're hurting your your race your image the city's image and he had the courage to say something.  But where's everybody else saying look can we address why this is happening and why it's really being left alone and and and nothing's really trying to be done about it.  It it it astounds me that no one's bringing up the the issue that it's a black problem. 
[00:29:00]  It's weird how we look at like we just white and black we just look at things differently.  You know when I first the first time I realized that like.  I was it was I hung out with weird killing my friends as a teenager were black I was like black guys from the projects I hung out with skinheads.  I had like a really weird I mean talk about diversity before it was popular man man you know I really had a fucking bizarre group of friends. 
[00:29:30]  And I remember me and my buddy Tyler went to see I think it was do the right thing.  And at the end of the movie it's a great movie Spike Lee.  Yeah where at the end Spike Lee is a pizza guy named Mookie and Danny Aiello is the white pizza owner in the black neighborhood frame.  Who hasn't seen it 28 years ago spoiler alert exactly Spike Lee 70 now Spike Lee takes a garbage can because this guy was it was the radio Raheem I think was choked out by the cops. 
[00:30:00]  So in anger he was choked out by misbehaving in the white establishment in the black neighborhood.  So the fucking Spike Lee throws a garbage can through the window and they burn the black the black guys in the neighborhood burn the white pizza place down.  And I was so angry that they did like I sided with the with Danny Aiello and his family like why would they do that they had been good to the neighborhood people.  And Tyler he was like no but I get why they did that like it was our gut reaction was immediately split opposite right. 
[00:30:30]  And it was fucking bizarre to me that somebody could see it that opposite from the way I saw it.  Yeah.  I knew we had just gotten the same information because we were sitting in the theater watching it.  Right.  You saw the same movie.  It was like we saw the exact same thing.  We were handed the exact same information.  There was no spin.  I saw how he got it.  And we came to 100% polar opposite conclusions.  So I guess it's like with stuff like this you just see it different.  Yeah.  But that's another thing people don't want to address is that in diversity you get different opinions based on your experiences growing up and your parents experiences put on you. 
[00:31:00]  And we don't think the same way.  We just don't.  But people love to think we all think the same way.  We all have the same ideas and ideals in our country.  And we as a no you know what no we don't.  Some people think much differently of the same situation than others.  It's it's and for people to not want to identify that or if you do identify it you're called you know racist or or a separatist or whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:31:30]  But we have very different ideology but the funny and you know what you're what can you look up the lead the definition of diversity because it's very funny how they talk about diversity.  They love that word diversity and the differences that make it.  But if you come out and go hey blacks and whites are different in that you're seen as a racist.  Yeah.  Or if you go down on well Mexicans do it like this and we do it like this you're a separatist.  It's almost like if diversity is bringing different people together but if you mention what's different about you you're considered a racist. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah the whole idea of diversity is to be diverse.  It is many things many choices and differences and the second you talk about it you're fucked.  And they don't want to look at like the fact diversity is it's the state or okay or fact of being diverse difference difference unlike on likeness variety multiple.  Uniformity a point of difference. 
[00:32:30]  So when you say it means different it means different.  So when you they say we celebrate diversity that means we celebrate our differences.  Yeah.  But if you mention the differences and I guess if you don't mention it in a 100% positive way you're fucking racist.  Right.  Yeah.  They have the deck rigged where if you don't go hand in hand and fucking drink that fucking nonsense Kool-Aid you're a racist.  You're a racist.  God I hate them.  And by them I mean the people making these fucking decisions which are mostly white.  Yeah.  The black guy wasn't offended by that ad. 
[00:33:00]  No he didn't care.  Most black people are not that hypersensitive when it comes to race.  The fucking black mayor talked about race.  It's fucking you pussy racist white people that are afraid of being seen as racist.  Yes.  Somebody over there at Nivea for that Recivilize Yourself ad got some complaints.  Probably got their board together.  Bunch of white guys cowering in a corner.  Yep.  That oh boy oh we look bad damage control.  And then they got their press people on it and the PR came in and they all had a meeting. 
[00:33:30]  We've seen this happen.  They all had a big meeting.  They penned their apology and put it out there and said we're pulling this.  It's not a knee jerk knee jerk a black people black people ahhh.  Yeah and that's exactly how people react to this alleged outrage which like I said I didn't  even hear about this until this morning.  Do you know with people seeing things different what made me think of that Tyler story was 
[00:34:00]  I follow Wendell Pierce on Twitter who was Bunk from the Wire who was fucking great when  he came in with Clark Peters.  What movie did I just see him in as a young guy?  It was an older movie too.  I'll have to remember.  You play a cop?  I don't think so.  He was just playing some black guy.  He did a thing on Twitter he was talking about.  He talks a lot about race issues.  I love following him.  He's in Treme in New Orleans so he's kind of down on the shit there. 
[00:34:30]  He said that he saw the help or his mother saw the help or somebody saw the help and he  was saying how at the end of it all these white people are just crying softly and he  said his mother who I think had done that like I guess worked in a black family was just  fucking seething.  Really?  He was angry and it was now I want to see it because I was just interesting that he pointed  out how this thing I think was he's like something about how Hollywood always shows you  the white hero and he's right.  They do.  They always show the good white person that comes in and saves all the darkies. 
[00:35:00]  I mean I'm paraphrasing by saying that but to me that's what it is and I fucking loved  that he said that but I guess it's about a white woman who does the right thing.  Do you know Sam?  Yeah I saw the help.  Okay.  It's like this one brave young.  I thought I was sitting through the help.  I sat through half of it and realized I was in the wrong theater.  Oh I better know what it was.  I don't think it was the help.  Oh.  What happened?  Yeah so what happened?  Yeah it's about this one like young brave white girl Emma Stone plays her in the south 
[00:35:30]  who wants to write about the experience of black maids.  Right.  Spoiler alert.  They're treated poorly.  Yeah.  But all the black maids are afraid to stand up to their white bosses but it's like Emma  Stone brings them out of their shells and gets them to.  In trouble.  You know well she keeps it anonymous.  Ah.  But you know what?  That's I totally agree with him on that Wendell Pierce because that's that's what they do  in Hollywood. 
[00:36:00]  They make these fucking these white hero movies and again these are the people who try to  dictate to the rest of us how awful we are to notice race in a negative way or even when  it should be.  But like you look at Mississippi Burning which was a fucking great movie a true story about  those three civil rights workers I think one black and two white who were killed for pushing  for black voting in Mississippi but the movie is about the heroes Gene Hackman and Willem  Defoe the hero white FBI agents and I guess that this is about the hero and I think in Amistad 
[00:36:30]  they focused on the hero white people they always focus on the hero white people yeah and he's  fucking 100% right but if you would tell the people who write this stuff you know you're  kind of subtly racist you really you're fucking paternalistic you know you want to show blacks  how look at how like how nice we've been to you as children have look at us we took care of you  yeah everything's cool is it good Sam I'm sorry the movie was sleepers I was watching that  uh with those young the young boys oh dear young boys and they go to that uh youth uh prison thing 
[00:37:00]  and get completely Kevin Bacon's in that by Kevin Bacon and and the other guards and um so when that when  they grow up and uh go through that whole revenge segment um if you remember they had a football game  against the guards and uh no really they they did and they beat the shit out of the guards but the  one thing that gave them an edge was they got one of the black kids uh in the reform school  to to play and he beat the shit out of a couple of the guards the guards beat the shit out of him 
[00:37:30]  and wound up killing him and uh bunk very young bunk was the brother of that black kid that the  guys came in and gave information to as to which guard killed him and they bring him out by the  airport beat the living piss out of him take him out when a plane's flying over to make a little  noise they just unload onto him on Wendell Pierce oh no on the uh the the guard uh that that killed  Wendell Pierce's uh brother oh wow okay Wendell Pierce was like uh he was a black uh organized 
[00:38:00]  crime figure oh okay yeah it was cool because I was watching going like oh my god yeah he's a  great actor young fucking bunk I want to see Tremant I haven't watched I said it's hard for me to get  into a new series but I fucking love him yeah I know it is it's so fucking hard to just get into a  new series like that especially with actors you like from another series you were really into  obviously the wire yeah uh it's so hard to like just be yeah it's a new character I don't know  I'll catch it next week he wrote he first noted uh actors never cease to amaze me what they do with 
[00:38:30]  the material given to them is crap I think he's saying how much he liked the film the acting but  then his criticism of the story became more pointed okay the movie the help was painful to watch this  passive segregation light was hurtful I kept thinking of my grandmother who was the help  he went to reveal that his mother told him for the first time when they saw the movie that she  too had been the help and had raised white children Pierce said that his mother was hurt and insulted by  the film because her experience was in fact significantly worse than was portrayed in the 
[00:39:00]  film which he was referring to as Jim Crow light my mother said it was a good story he said but she  knows difference uh she knows a different reality and there was a thing where he said the white hero  just not in that particular thing it's Travis if we scroll down more is it there no he did he did say  something about that white here I didn't just make it up now is that movie uh is that subject matter  too heavy for the movie itself if if they would have gotten into like the real brutality that was  going on would that have made the movie like I thought I was gonna get some chuckles here yeah 
[00:39:30]  there's a couple things working because I think that in order for like mainstream to really embrace  it and for the academy to look at it and all this stuff that that I think they wanted because they  wanted women because it's based on a novel that a lot of women read yeah okay and so they wanted  women to go see it and like you know that's hence you being in the theater yeah exactly there with a  twink fucking yeah exactly with a fucking house I can picture him with a house dress yeah not even  sexually dressed but like a really shitty long ill-fitting house dress and fucking white ladies  slippers yeah pants on oh um but yeah I think that they couldn't go Jess's pants exactly they couldn't 
[00:40:00]  go much I'm in the family they couldn't go much farther than uh the help having to use separate  bathrooms oh really yeah and I think Hollywood also knows that if they didn't have a white hero in  the movie and if it was just about the black people yeah white people wouldn't go to see the  movie was the word nigger used at all I it might have been not a lot obviously now now that should 
[00:40:30]  have been used because that probably was used a lot uh during during that word Jim Crow yeah yeah  it was the the word I think it was used but not yeah not ad nauseum and was Emma Stone cast in this  because she's kind of known as the funny quirky girl in movies is this a purely dramatic role for her  or or or was she being comedic so that it would have been awkward to throw in some really horrific  racist moments uh she wasn't being comedic she was more playing to her feisty self than the sort of 
[00:41:00]  you know feisty girl yeah she was the feisty like you know I may be young but I went to college and  I'm gonna go get a job yeah even though women in this time period don't she's hot even though she  does look like one of those fish you bring up from the deep water and they kind of decompress and  their eyeballs pop out of their head yeah here's the here's the actual tweet that he oh watching  the film in uptown new orleans to the sniffles of elderly white people while my 80 year old mother 
[00:41:30]  was seething made clear distinction wow that's great sniffles I love the sniffles of white people  wendell pierce on twitter I really love oh they went through so much meanwhile it's like they just  couldn't use the same bathroom hey don't use my towel yeah monogrammed yeah I just I just think that uh  he what he's he's saying is he's just sick and tired of these fucking on the tip of your nose  what do I do I don't know something white oh is it on something white on the tip of my nose  it must be good um just sick and tired of white people have a really way of weird way of doing 
[00:42:00]  that it's it's like the whole the whole culture of throwing other white people under the bus  yeah to fucking uh to hide their subtle superiority shit it just fucking makes me sick do you think  because I'm always thinking uh as a white person that that black people need to change  uh some of their ways in order to assimilate into um uh white society better but is it the other way  around what would happen if if white people stopped being this paternalistic uh apologetic society 
[00:42:30]  would it make things worse would it make some black people go oh wow now no one gives a shit  about us or would it finally be like look you're just like everyone else members of our society and  you'll be treated as such I don't I don't know I think a lot of what and again it's it's I really  do believe that a lot of what goes on with like uh in certain black neighborhoods I do think a good  amount of it is poverty related I'm not and I'm not explaining away all behavior but some of it I think 
[00:43:00]  is poverty related I don't know blacks need to assimilate into white society as much um I just I just  the way it's talked about so dishonestly it almost makes it look like the problem is swept under the  carpet so it's not addressed so yeah I do think if it wasn't as apologetic a lot more would get done  because people would just deal with it honestly because yeah you think Farrakhan doesn't look at  that and go look what these fucking guys he's not dumb yeah he knows what's happening he's been  calling black people out for years but he also calls out white people that's why nobody listens to 
[00:43:30]  him yeah that's why white people don't like him because Bill Cosby doesn't call out white people  Bill Cosby who is right calls out black people and he calls them out so white people are like  look what Dr. Cosby's been saying but Farrakhan that's when they call him Dr. William H. Cosby Jr.  because Farrakhan is fucking look and I don't agree with a lot of Farrakhan I'm tired of people  hating Jews I'm fucking sick of it it's so old it really is and it's not accurate how old is that  like thousands of years it's like they blame Jews for everything it's boring it's like stop it  but uh the fact that he fucking attacks that fucking white paternalism too and he doesn't want to hear it 
[00:44:00]  that's why the white media just vilifies him he also thinks you know that a spaceship is uh up and um  hiding up in space waiting to take black people to some kind of paradise that is idiotic but you  know what if you didn't listen to people based on religious stuff you would really say to the pope  could you take that hat off and explain how the man pushed the rock away when he was dead go that is  true I'll give you that one no matter how dumb a religion is we just kind of talk like all right 
[00:44:30]  well you're we're afraid of religion it's sacred yeah fucking nonsense you're all assholes it's  hokum I call it hokum language uh you I'm kind of hungry I got my sandwich here I'm hungry for you  and uh oh oh yes people say no every day yes I hope he's on vacation yeah he's on vacation uh this  week where'd he wind up going I believe he's uh in his usual beach place I don't know the beach  place I don't know if he says the beach house yeah okay the outer banks he never got that 
[00:45:00]  specific no well oh Sam blew it now it's the outer banks how are you gonna track them down in the  outer banks look at them on the beach Jesus who's that standing next to the turtles oh it's all  he says it every year yeah well that's where he is I can't believe it's a fucking year ago man  yeah yeah was that the hurricane one hurricanes Alice it was that the himicane or something oh you  hurricane Irene uh working its way up uh the coast yeah actually the Caribbean so and hope 
[00:45:30]  he's gonna be there the whole week so we may actually get another uh hurricane uh they said  on the news that it'll be right around South Carolina like Friday-ish yeah and if that happens  it will be if it does go up to the outer banks it will probably hit on almost exactly the same day to  the year to the year last year because it was the end of the first week yeah he was on vacation last  year I think the townsfolk there are gonna just uh pitchfork and and and torch his ass uh out of 
[00:46:00]  the out of the outer banks it's because it seems to be him yes it's the ob uh jinx he has the sports  jinx as well as the fucking uh yes the hurricane jinx hey before we go to break before I forget I  just want to say uh I had a great time in Utah I just want to thank uh Keith Stubbs who's the he's a  comedian kind of owner of what wise guys fucking hardcore ONA fan he is and so is the audience I  mean uh 90 percent of them that came were hardcore ONA fans in Salt Lake City oh that's fucking cool  and Salt Lake City uh nice fucking I didn't do much I slept all day Saturday um but the people were 
[00:46:30]  unbelievable that's right I haven't liked a road gig that much in a long time wow did you see some  Mormons you know it's funny we came off the plane we're going down the escalator and there's a sign  somebody said welcome back elder putter and I'm like oh yeah it's this is where you are yeah I  did you didn't feel like you're anywhere different until you see like the occasional uh guy walking  around with five chicks yeah exactly what the fuck but that was that was the only difference I mean I  didn't notice it at the shows yeah but they were exactly the ONA fans are exactly like they are here 
[00:47:00]  yeah that's cool um so thank you to I just want to say thanks to wise guys Utah not China no I know that  but you know it's just like I was here I couldn't believe they were just like Americans it's like  when you meet a black person I couldn't believe he was he was very uh well spoken so well spoken  and articulate but yeah I was just it's like you just forget that the people in Utah just like they  are in Jersey so I love the gig and the fucking club was amazing I really I haven't had that much

[00:54:30]  upon suicide to stop another diabolical villain.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Deep Down.  Deep Down.  Oh, look at that.  E-Rock, right on the ball with that song, because we were talking about the Sopranos.  No, it's not a best of.  We are here live.  Tom Chiasano is off today. 
[00:55:00]  No!  Anthony's going on a cruise soon.  A cruise soon.  Opie's out sick today.  No!  But it looks like Jones and I will be doing...  What was his name?  Oh, cunt me.  I can't think of a...  Fat Boy Shithat Jones.  Sorry, K-Rock.  Oh, Shithat.  Remember him?  Yeah.  Oh, Cream Pie Jones.  Cream Pie.  Yeah, we were just talking about how much better it is to watch a series like The Sopranos  Now on your DVD or whatever the fuck media you choose, because you don't have to wait 
[00:55:30]  two years between seasons.  And the best is to watch, I said it during the break, with somebody who hasn't seen the  series or doesn't remember it, because Jess is pop culture illiterate in a lot of ways.  Like, she doesn't know things have happened.  Like, she didn't know there was a sequel to The Godfather.  After we watched The Godfather, I was like, see, I couldn't show you the cover of Godfather  2, because Al Pacino is obviously in full mode. 
[00:56:00]  And she goes, they made a sequel?  They...  Holy shit.  Wow, that is...  And I go, yeah.  That is pure innocence.  Where did she grow up?  Candyland?  Yeah.  But she's seen...  It's an empty vessel.  She's seen the Father of the Bride series multiple times.  Wow.  But she had no idea that Big Pussy gets whacked at all on The Sopranos.  Oh, spoiler alert.  So, yeah, sorry.  So, going through the first two seasons when we were watching on DVD, I just had to avoid  any Sopranos conversation. 
[00:56:30]  Like, he was on a reality show, and I couldn't watch it, because whenever you see him, somebody  mentions Big Pussy and getting whacked.  And getting whacked.  Yeah.  Getting killed off.  Oh, man.  But she finally saw it, and it was amazing, because it was from over 10 years ago at this  point, and he gets on the boat in that scene, and she goes, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's not coming.  Because I asked her, like, midway through season two, I said, who do you think is going  to survive, like, all the way to the end of the series?  She goes, well, Tony and Pussy, obviously.  And then... 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Jesus.  And then she said...  Was she wrong?  The first major character to be fucking whacked out was Pussy.  Yeah.  But it reminded me of, like, what a surprise...  Like, nobody really thought he was gonna...  Like, he was as big as all the other guys were in the first two seasons.  Yeah, he was massive.  Yeah, that was it.  We're talking about the lay...  You guys raised in the break the layoffs.  I forgot how long the show would be off.  And that would infuriate you.  You'd watch a season, get to the season finale, and then they'd leave you hanging, and 
[00:57:30]  you'd be like, oh, great, now I gotta wait, like, two fucking years before I know what's  gonna happen.  So it infuriated you even more when you weren't getting the wrap-ups on some of the storylines,  because it's like, I waited two years, motherfucker!  Pay off!  Yeah, and they basically just implied that something had wrapped it up while they weren't  on the air.  Yeah, during those two years.  And you never knew what it was.  Just fill in the blanks yourself.  But look, like, season four to season five was two years.  It was a year between most of them, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002. 
[00:58:00]  And then five and six was another two-year break.  Between four and five, it went 2002 to 2004.  And then 2004 to 2006...  Fuck.  2002 to 2006, you only had one...  Like, there was almost two year-and-a-half breaks with a season in between them.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was almost three years with one season in the middle.  It was really weird...  Menno and AJ are grown-ups by the time you...  Exactly.  And children.  They were children.  And then they were just grown adults. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Kind of silly to even have them at the house.  You're just...  Eh, what?  That's an adult.  My dad's favorite line in the series is still episode one, when little tiny 13-year-old  AJ goes, so what, no fucking ZD?  Yeah, that is a good one.  We were talking about the fucking...  How funny was...  The lines, the best lines in the series were, you said, Paulie, which were great.  Yeah, Paulie had great ones.  So did Phil Liataro though.  Frank Vincent had some brutal fucking lines.  Yeah, yeah.  When he's yelling at Christopher's mother, and he goes, where is he?  I'll shove that Walkman up your box! 
[00:59:00]  Nick DiPaulo is obsessed with fucking Phil Liataro.  Yeah.  Cause he is Nick.  I mean, they're the same fucking awful person.  It's true.  But Nick always reminds me what funny lines of Frank Vincent had in The Sopranos.  Vincent had The Sopranos, and God damn, he had some fucking gems.  They just know how to cast him.  Yeah, he was amazing.  Anything they put him in is hilarious whenever he opens his yap.  But there was a great fucking line in the hospital.  We were talking about that one.  If you haven't seen it yet, just a spoiler alert. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  Yeah.  It's when Tony is in season six.  Tony is in his coma.  Yeah.  After being shot.  And Paulie has not seen Tony in that situation yet.  So Meadow is walking him into the hospital, and she's just telling him, like, Paulie, just, you have to be positive.  All right.  So he hasn't seen him yet.  They even tell you a spoiler warning. 
[01:00:00]  And then he gets to the door, obviously.  Now's our moment.  The main thing, when people come to sit with Dad, the doctors want positive talk.  It helps in his recovery.  Got it.  He gets to the door.  Oof, marron.  He looks terrible.  You can't see stuff like that.  You have to stay positive.  Yeah.  It's just, nothing prepares you for that.  Uncle Paul.  Nothing.  Nothing prepares you for that.  One person at a time, please. 
[01:00:30]  She's a ball buster.  All right.  Finn's on his way up.  I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?  Oof.  Remember, stay positive.  And by the way, I almost talked over it.  What a shit.  I'm just trying to let people know that that's what he's saying that at the door.  What a fucking, what a worthless radio anchor I am.  My apologies to the audience.  I just, it's like, if you're hearing that and not seeing it, you might not know he said  that as he walked in the door.  He's walking right in the door.  Oof.  Like, oof, marron.  Wouldn't have tipped you off.  Sorry about that. 
[01:01:00]  That stunk.  Asshole.  Jess and me just started season three, so she met Jackie Jr.  And Jackie Jr. is, you know, hitting on meadow or whatever.  She don't know what's coming to him.  She don't know what's coming.  Nope.  So do you sit there and then, like, peer over when you know something's going to happen  to see what her reaction is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably a tip off.  But I love it, because she's very, a very honest person with her, so she'll just go,  oh, no.  Yeah.  Or, like, she did not see, like, she hated Richie Aprile, and so she thought, like, she 
[01:01:30]  thought there was something building towards, you know, uh-oh, he's going to get in trouble.  And then all of a sudden Janice just shoots him, and she goes, what?  Yeah.  I hated that, by the way, when she shot him.  I thought that was such a fucking shitty way to end that.  Like a cop-out.  Yeah, I felt like, oh, this is when, is this when Pauly's talking to him?  Oh, that's Richie Aprile.  Yeah.  Can't hear it.  65% historical chance of rain on the 12th.  So he wants to get a tent for backup, so-  Janice.  He's just blubbering.  I can't decide on a shit like that, Janice. 
[01:02:00]  Come on.  Janice.  But when you start pitching, when you see the bell, don't.  My kid hit me up for five grand today to go to England for these dance contests.  Yeah, but little Rick is still coming to the wedding, right?  Rick.  Rick.  I can watch all these again.  Yeah.  How many fucking times I got to tell you.  There's Bobby Kelly.  It was little Ricky when he was 12 years old.  Jesus Christ.  Take a seat, Bob.  We're watching The Sopranos.  Yeah.  We're just watching. 
[01:02:30]  We're just watching.  We're watching TV.  He's still coming, right?  He wouldn't miss an opportunity to fucking Foxtrot and Tango.  How long did they make this clip?  They should have just shown us.  All dancing is a legitimate art form.  But you don't see it coming.  No.  You really don't.  I think that's the whole thing, the build-up.  I kind of liked this.  This was not the...  He was a big character.  And this was the episode before the finale.  Right.  So you figured he'd get off to the finale and all of a sudden...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I've been in this house cooking your fucking dinner and taking care of that fucking 
[01:03:00]  It's just couple blubbering.  And just arguing.  Yeah.  So you don't expect the...  And they argue all the time.  Janice is a terribly disagreeable.  Janice is a fucking awful woman.  She's horrible.  Not likely.  Put my fucking dinner on the table and keep your mouth shut.  There you go.  Shut up.  Uh-oh.  But just because he's a ballroom dancer, you think your son is gay?  And what if he was gay?  What difference does it make?  Well...  Oh, he sucked her right in the mouth.  He punched her.  Like, you shut up. 
[01:03:30]  Boy, she was not having that.  No.  He just turns his back on her, too, like that.  Yeah.  With that after a nice belt in the face.  How's the Italian food here?  He's just standing with his fucking horrible shirt.  Whoever picked out the shirts in this series should still be winning awards.  They're fucking terrible.  Come on.  Don't touch me.  Come on.  He's eating his ziti.  And she's standing there looking at him.  You gonna cry now?  You gonna cry now? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, boy.  That was the wrong thing to say.  Oh, see.  He probably should have just said, I'm sorry.  Yeah, bad timing.  And then left the house.  Hey, hey, I'm sorry.  Pride will do that to a person.  Yeah.  She got that gun quick.  Oh, yeah.  I'm in no mood for you.  Oh, shit.  The shock on his face.  Right in the oil pump.  His last words were, I'm in no mood for you.  I'm in no mood for you.  And she shoots him again.  Oh, yeah.  Twice in the fucking chest. 
[01:04:30]  Jess didn't even know that Tony's mom, the actress, died.  Really?  So she didn't, she figured, she didn't know how long Tony's mom, she figured his mom would  be around forever.  How fucking, dude, to me she was the best person in the series.  She was so great.  He should go shit in his hat.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, she's the greatest.  Nice language for your mother.  Miserable old bitch.  I don't like that talk.  Oh, she was fucking great.  Pretending she has Alzheimer's. 
[01:05:00]  In the end, you die in your own arms.  What a fucking, how sad that she died second season, man.  Yeah.  At the end of second season.  And then they try to computerize her face.  It actually worked okay, though.  I don't know, because you knew it.  At one point, her head was too big for her body when she was sitting in the chair.  And if you're watching the DVDs, like you had just seen the episode, you'd know where  those lines came from.  Yeah, yeah.  Like when you're watching, there'd been a year off, and you were like, wow.  Oh, that's true, yeah, yeah.  But when you watch the DVDs, you're like, I remember the episode where she said that.  Yeah.  How's that worth it? 
[01:05:30]  Hi.  Hi, Bobby.  Bobby Kelly.  He should have said something like, I'm back from the dead or something.  Nah, that wouldn't have worked, Chip.  What about when Richie is fucking Janice with a gun?  Into her head.  Oh, yeah.  And then Tony's mom comes down the stairs on that electric thing on the wall.  The electric seat on the staircase.  What's going on?  She's just so toxic and horrendous.  Killjoy.  I can't stand her.  Bobby Kelly, as we said, is in the... 
[01:06:00]  Bobby just showed me a picture of his wife with like a goofy eyes and glasses saying,  I can't wait to see you.  I fucking hate her.  Is she doing the chip voice?  She's dead.  I went home last night and carved her eyes out, her real eyes out.  She likes chip.  And I wrote, tits, tits on her chest.  In excrement.  Yeah.  How are you doing, Robert?  I think I'm going to die.  Actually, you're doing bad.  We're doing great. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know, man.  I think it's...  You got a cough?  Cold that won't go away?  No, I don't.  I think my heart is going to stop.  Why?  Well, why don't you just change what you just said and put a T on the end of it and maybe  you fucking extend your life a little bit.  I think I'm going to die it.  Wow.  Not a great joke, but also helpful information.  Yes.  It wasn't meant to be a joke.  It was just so fast and confusing.  Now, you put a fucking D in it and put a bit of heat in it and get it better hold  up on a fucking limerick. 
[01:07:00]  Why?  What's the matter?  You're feeling that?  You do hand jive when you tell that.  You're not feeling like a healthy guy?  I don't know what it feels like.  I'm just a piece of shit.  I feel like shit, dude.  I can't stop smoking.  Yes, you can.  I'm fucking chain smoking now.  That shit off.  I'm literally coughing on the way over here with a cigarette in my mouth.  Out of breath.  I fucking, I can't, I feel like shit.  I don't know.  I get like pains.  Oh, shit.  No.  Wait a minute, dude. 
[01:07:30]  Don't say that.  I'm just saying, you know, you got to be careful with the pains.  You got to stop, Bobby.  Stop smoking.  Seriously.  Yeah, stop smoking.  I did.  If fucking Voss, if that bag of shit, who is a slave to his fucking dumbness more than  anybody can quit smoking.  Dude, he used to fall asleep with cigarettes in his mouth.  Yeah.  He used to fucking do his black spots on his floor because cigarettes would fall.  Oh, he should have burnt.  He should have burnt.  He should have burnt.  He did.  He just wasn't there.  I know.  He wasn't there.  Yeah.  We haven't even spoken to Voss about that whole thing.  We got to get him on.  Yeah.  About his burnt out condo. 
[01:08:00]  You guys have your good friend's house burnt down and you haven't talked to him?  I know.  We haven't said anything.  I talked to Voss.  Oh, you talked to him?  That night he called me.  Oh, good.  Good.  Yeah.  I was thinking of Voss last night, though, because I was watching, what the fuck movie was  where he was doing the lines from it, Louie Beans.  Oh, yeah.  Bronx Tale.  Yeah, Bronx Tale.  I was watching a Bronx Tale.  I was watching a Bronx Tale last night when that whole line comes up.  And it's a little different in the movie because it was the actual stage one-man show version 
[01:08:30]  of the script.  Yeah.  And it wasn't Louie Beans.  It was Louie Dumps.  Oh, okay.  Louie Dumps in the movie.  But, yeah, watching that, though, you read, Sean?  Oh, shut up.  That was at the old studios, right?  Yeah.  The old girl.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  You got to stop, though, man.  If you're feeling the chest pains, that's your body going, ahem.  That's your fucking body letting you know.  Ahem.  You're my age, man. 
[01:09:00]  I just got a new cigarette case, though.  It's kind of jazzy.  Yeah, cool.  James Bond.  You'll have a nice case to lay in, too, stupid.  No, because a cigarette pack won't fit in my jeans.  I needed something thinner.  You're not 20.  I'm not trying to bum you out, but you're fucking 42.  I'm not 42.  I'm 40.  Whatever you are, you're my age almost.  It's a big fucking difference.  Literally, you are at that age where your fucking body will shut down if you don't stop smoking.  You got to stop.  I stopped.  I love to smoke.  I get it.  I'm a slave, dude, just like you.  And kids, it makes you look great, either. 
[01:09:30]  I love to compulsively eat.  You and I are the same fucking guy.  I know, I know.  I acknowledge I like trannies a lot more than you do.  Believe me, there's a lot of cocks out there with your name on them, my friend.  Quit smoking and start sucking.  Stop being so selfish when I ask you in the QT.  And you go, I don't know.  But you got to stop, seriously, man.  And it's like fucking...  Because Bobby's a compulsive guy.  When you're going to the gym, you go a lot and you get in a shape and you lose your weight.  You can lose the weight.  You got to stop smoking.  You got to just bite the fucking bullet.  Fuck it.  It's so fucking... 
[01:10:00]  Take everything else out of your mouth and bite the bullet.  It's so hard, though, fucking being married and losing weight and quitting smoking.  Because she smokes, too.  We usually wind up quitting and I'll get stressed out.  I'll get fucked up.  I usually get my anger issues come back.  I mean, I fucking hate everybody.  Really?  Yeah.  My therapist has been gone.  They all go away for the month of August.  They just go away.  Is that like what they do?  Yeah.  That's the big month?  Yeah.  Big vacation month.  Nothing happens in August where you need like a chat? 
[01:10:30]  No, a lot of shit happens.  A lot of shit happens.  I'm just talking to myself, muttering down the street.  Fucking women.  Fucking twats.  They all fucking suck.  I was at the cell the other night and every woman that walked up...  I don't hate women.  Wow.  But that voice.  What do you do?  That fucking voice.  That...  Excuse me.  It's like the gay accent.  Like, why do gay guys talk like...  Yeah.  Women have an accent.  Fucking dumb women have that... 
[01:11:00]  Excuse me.  Do you know how to get into the cellar?  I mean, it's like an octave above the rest of us.  Yeah.  It's called a girl's voice.  It's an octave above usually.  Or if you're with Jimmy, it's an octave below.  Hi, daddy.  I like traits.  So, just their voice alone, not like a...  Because I can understand a woman that's talking like Vincent.  That doesn't bug me.  That doesn't bug me.  It's just a woman's voice.  That doesn't bug me. 
[01:11:30]  A chick, hey, how you doing?  That doesn't...  Girls, like, hey, how...  They have regular voices, but there's that girl, like rich, white, young girl.  Sometimes they go into the older chicks, too.  But it's that, excuse me, we're trying to get into the cellar, like that valley girl.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  And they're at the restaurant, and they're louder than everybody.  You know, you're whispering, like, yeah, man, that was really good.  And they're in the back, like, so he comes in my house, and I'm like, get out of here. 
[01:12:00]  And it's like, shut the fuck.  Wow.  Fucking...  Don't you know restaurant voice?  I don't want to fucking listen to you.  And I...  Every girl that walked up to me Saturday night, and it fucking hurt my self-esteem,  because I can't sit out in front of the cellar without somebody thinking I'm a door guy.  It's like, I'm a comic.  I was on TV.  Anything?  Yeah, nothing.  The worst is when they say that at the end of the show.  Yeah.  You were good. 
[01:12:30]  You were good.  Thank you for letting us in.  My eggplant was cold.  Good improv.  Did that's what you order at a comedy club?  That's all I am.  Some blackout with a sweater on.  You're at Voss's comedy clubs because they're at fucking real restaurants.  Yeah, what is parmesan?  Can I have Kenoki?  You gotta quit smoking.  I used to bug Voss all the time, too, after a certain point.  You were just gonna cough, aren't you?  Yeah, you gotta stop.  I cough so bad in the morning now.  Oh, no.  I'm gonna tell you this. 
[01:13:00]  I cough so bad in the morning, I almost pass out.  Like, you get your blood pressure in your head just, like...  No, like...  Like, I...  And I'm starting to like it.  Like...  Oh, it's like a high?  It's like I'm getting to the point where I'm like...  I'm like, you know, you're almost passing out where you go numb a little bit.  Holy shit.  This is not a good thing.  But wait a minute.  I blame it on the AC.  Because I have a deviated septum, the way I sleep, I'm overweight, all the phlegm gets 
[01:13:30]  stuck in my chest, and when I wake up, I have sinus issues and stuff.  When I wake up, it's all phlegm, you know, from the AC and the room being cold, and it  just gets trapped in my throat.  No.  How many packs a day do you smoke?  17.  Oh, that's not bad.  I thought it was bad.  Yeah, I have to fucking rip the filters off now, which bugs me.  What is it, a pack and a half?  I smoke...  What do you smoke, too?  I smoke...  I can't tell you what I smoke.  Why?  I guess.  I'll show you.  Virginia Slims?  Yeah, I smoke... 
[01:14:00]  I like them...  I like them...  I like them slim and misty.  Misty's?  Slim though, slim and sassy.  I hated when I was smoking and having a bum-off cigarette, and it would be like, hey, you  got a cigarette, and a girl would give you like a Misty or a fucking Virginia Slim.  I like one of those.  Just something you just...  Smoking like Buford T. Justin with your hand wide open.  Oh, yeah!  And he'd take a drag of that cigarette with his hands like he's saying, like he couldn't  fuck it.  He's telling someone a mile away the number five. 
[01:14:30]  Five!  Yeah.  He's holding all fingers up, puts it right in front of his face.  Hey, boy.  But his fingers went out.  When he took a haul, they went out a little bit.  Yeah.  And then they closed back up.  Yeah.  Here you go.  This is what I smoke.  Camel.  Jesus.  Camel number nines.  Camel number nines.  A lot of people are smoking.  They're very trendy.  Well, they're actually smooth.  But I used to smoke the American Spirits, but those really...  Those are horrible.  I would wake up all night and cough off of those.  Ingencies, cigarettes. 
[01:15:00]  I'm getting freaked out.  Your body is telling you that if you don't stop, your health is going to fail for real.  But I'm thinking that sometimes when people get a heart attack, it's the thing they need  in life to jumpstart the rest of their lives.  No, it's the thing people around them need.  To jumpstart the rest of their lives.  You know what I'm saying?  Jesus.  It seems like after somebody gets sick, they get their shit together for like 20 years.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Yeah, unless it's too late. 
[01:15:30]  But, you know, there are some people that have health issues in like their 60s, and it's  just over.  Just keep doing what you're doing.  Oh, yeah.  If you get colon cancer, was it prostate cancer in your 60s?  They're like, you know what?  Just keep it.  Don't worry.  You ain't going to die until you fucking would have been dead anyway.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, if you're a big fat fuck and you're, you know, as old as fat fucks live  to, just don't even die it.  And also, you could have a stroke, man.  It's not just a fucking heart attack.  Suck me in that comic. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  We already had the bear eating your face off comic.  We had Burnt Bobby.  Burnt Bobby.  We had Bear Bobby.  Wait, what happened?  We did have, we had Burnt Bobby, where he did the act after he was in a fire and he had  no ears, no lips, and no eyelids.  And he's up there still being funny.  Still got the spirit.  And then, uh, just recently when we were on the show, we had mountain lion or bear attack,  Bobby, where his face was eaten away.  And it was all just scar tissue, no eyes left. 
[01:16:30]  Someone's got to guide him up on stage.  I have no hands.  No hands.  Your two stumps grab the stand.  My stand.  It has to be left there.  If it falls down, an audience member has to help you.  Yeah.  When I make jokes, I go, I didn't plot too, but I can't.  Look.  Oh, and then just smash your stumps together.  Yeah, it sounds like wood clanging together.  Uncomfortable chuckles in the audience.  Everyone's just horrified.  You keep it in your pocket like a smoking jacket.  Keep both stumps in your pocket because you're repulsive to look at.  And then the stroke, Bobby, we don't want to see. 
[01:17:00]  You're not dead.  No, we don't want to see that, Bobby.  You know, people are saying to me, how do you get around?  And I say, I'm just a stroke or two.  What?  What?  You know what?  You would try to make it yours?  You know what?  I used to play golf, but now I'm down in a stroke.  I wish I could take a stroke off my game of life. 
[01:17:30]  You know, when I swim, I do the breast and face stroke.  Oh, my God.  And now some impression.  Sylvester Stallone.  Dick Clark.  Oh, Dick Clark is nine, eight, seven, six.  Two more numbers.  Five.  Two more numbers. 
[01:18:00]  Fucking asshole.  Why don't you start with 40?  I did start it.  Oh, you really.  Yeah, you got it.  You got to quit the smoking.  Smoking is probably the single worst thing you could do to your body.  You smoked, right?  I think.  Oh, yeah.  How many years you smoked for?  I smoked for many years.  On and off.  From the time I was like 17 until like early 40s.  I've been smoking since I was 10.  On and off.  I quit for nine years, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I quit for nine years.  I quit for like five years at one point. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  And then I quit for like a year.  And then you just go, eh, fuck this.  I gotta smoke.  It's great.  I quit when I got sober for nine years.  And then I started smoking cigars mid-sobriety somewhere.  So I just fucking picked up.  I go over the edge.  Yeah, I picked up butts.  Then I quit for two years.  And then I quit last month.  Last year for like six months.  I remember when you quit at one point.  And like Bobby, watching Bobby.  Because again, we're the same dude.  Yeah.  Like when you start smoking again, I'm like, I can't have one.  Like it's tempting once in a while to have a cigarette. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  You know, of course.  But then I see Bobby who's right back to it.  It's like, well, if that happened to Bobby, it'll happen to me.  I'm not better than him or different than him.  Yeah.  You gotta stop.  Career.  House.  Women.  I got nothing, dude.  Money.  After 2000.  Penis.  I seen your dick.  It's nice.  Thank you.  It's fucking nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Looks like it's been in a lab getting tested on.  It has been.  The lab is called.  You should have a numbered tattoo on the side of it.  The lab is called the Meatpacking District. 
[01:19:30]  Fucking.  They don't hang out there anymore.  I'm just kidding.  You gotta stop, man.  And then you fucking.  Come on.  There's no day that will be magically.  You know what made me stop?  I told you.  It was that contest we had.  Oh, God.  And fucking.  That guy.  At WNEW.  It was fucking December 7, 2001.  And I'm sitting there.  And Anthony said, I think you were stopped at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting there.  And I smoked Parliament at the time.  And I'm like, I would go in the hallway and smoke.  And I'm like, all right, I'm gonna quit after this pack. 
[01:20:00]  And Anthony just got so disgusted.  He goes, just throw him out.  Throw it away now.  Just quit.  Because everybody wants to have, like, one more pack or one more cigarette.  It's like, if you want to quit, you gotta just throw it away right now.  And I always said, you never end up just with a cigarette in your mouth, lit, inhaling,  going, what happened?  There's a whole chain of events that have to take place before you are actually smoking a cigarette.  And during that time, you're an individual.  You're a smart guy.  You know to be like, all right, if I put this in my mouth and put a match to it, I'll be smoking. 
[01:20:30]  Let's not do that.  Well, I had one more.  And then you're not smoking.  I said, I'm gonna have one more cigarette.  And I took the pack.  And I crumpled it up.  I kept my last cigarette.  And I went into the hallway at N.E.W.  And I still can't believe that that was my last cigarette.  But up to now, that was it.  And I went right down to the cellar.  They were still smoking in the cellar at that point.  And fucking Esty marched me down the street to get the patch.  And fucking, I just took it a day to time.  She just didn't want you in the club.  But Esty, I'm supposed to be on stage. 
[01:21:00]  It's okay.  Don't worry.  Eventually, you're going to call people, tell them to get AIDS and get the taxi.  And get bad press for the club.  She put the patch over his mouth.  Or over my ears or something.  I don't know.  Something like that.  Fucking A.  You gotta quit, though, bro.  And I know, no, I don't like to not quit, right?  If you, like, addictive personality.  It's a gene.  You have it.  It's scientifically proven that some people are addictive.  And I have addictive personality.  You do.  Voss does.  Everybody we know does, right? 
[01:21:30]  But, okay, if I give up smoking, and then, you know, food is fucking killing me, too.  You know, it's back on the fucking menu.  No pun intended.  Okay.  And then, and then, I quit smoking, quit that, and you quit the sex addiction.  There's nothing left.  I mean, I haven't done drugs or drinking for 25 years.  This is what goes through my head, though.  I know.  It's like, okay, am I going to go to that, and then I'm going to ruin my fucking life?  And, you know, at least with the smoking and the eating, it's sociably acceptable and tolerated, 
[01:22:00]  and people really don't fuck with you every once in a while.  So you can kind of hide in the darkness with it.  And you can sneak that shit and get fat, get skinny.  People make fun of you.  They say you look good.  No, they don't.  It's a, I'm not going to interrupt you, but what you said right there, what Bobby just said,  I'll look at sex like that.  Like, the rationale you're using to smoke, like, that's what addiction is.  Like, and I'll think to myself, like, so what if I fucking get a whore?  I mean, at least I'm not fucking giving myself cancer. 
[01:22:30]  At least I'm not doing drugs.  It's like every addiction is the at least.  And if you're shooting heroin, you can't go at least.  You go, well, at least I'm not as bad as that guy.  But that's the, those at least are the fucking worst words of the English language.  It allows us to do anything.  But I understand that, dude.  Yeah, it's, it's scary though, because I don't want to, I know how fucking weak my brain.  Look, I know I've quit drinking.  I know my brain is that powerful.  I can do whatever the fuck I want.  It's amazing to me.  I can't imagine.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  But it's.  It'd be terrible.  Like, what would you do when you don't drink shit?  But there's something they call when you quit drinking, they say we're afraid we're going  to be the hole in the donut, like we're not going to exist.  And that's how I felt with sex.  But that's how we stay addicted to shit.  You feel like there's nothing that will replace this giant piece of my life.  But there's, well, then you realize it's just a horrible distraction.  I get so much more shit done when I'm not like jerking off sexually.  I write more.  I'm fucking, when I'm not acting out, I'm being creative. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  When I'm not passed out.  Yeah, but like, I was talking to somebody about alcohol.  I don't, I don't get it.  I don't care, you know, if people drink, but I don't, it's, it's fucking poison.  It's fucking poison that they have to add shit to, to make it tolerable.  Because your taste buds, as soon as you put it in your mouth, your whole body goes,  ugh.  You can't swallow alcohol without going, ugh.  I mean, it's fucking gross.  When you think about it, it is a deadly poison. 
[01:24:00]  It's a deadly poison.  In, in, in quantity, it can kill you in one, in one sitting, not even over time or things  like that.  But it poisons you just enough to fuck your body up and make you like, ah, this is cool,  I'm drunk.  That's really fucking, that's odd when you think about it.  It's like, I just want to poison myself enough to stumble around a little bit, not being able  to talk, not being able to talk.  It doesn't make sense.  It really is weird.  Like, I was talking to Jack Vaughn about it, I'm like, I don't get it, why these people, 
[01:24:30]  because I was down in the cellar Friday and Saturday, and it gets so crazy down there.  Yeah.  On McDougal.  But, and everybody who's there, young and old, are there to poison themselves.  Just, just enough so they don't die.  Get housed, motherfucker.  Right.  Yeah.  And, and you can see the beginning of the night, it's like, ah, excuse me, do you know  where, and then it, ah, look at, two o'clock, it's like, fuck the fights.  People screaming, dumb girls, stumbling with one high heel on, holding the other broken 
[01:25:00]  one.  That's so hot.  I love that shit.  Listen to yourself coughing.  Bobby, they're going to pull a piece of your fucking tongue or jaw out.  I'm telling you.  Oh, God.  You've got to stop, brother.  Oh, no.  If I can quit, I don't like that he actually got happy when he said that.  Oh, no.  Like Roger Ebert.  He would buy my jaw off eBay and put it, have me sign it.  I would just, no, I would just, I would, I would put it in a bottle like a ship and  say the fucking, the, the something that has launched a thousand dumb thoughts.  You got it.  I'm serious, man. 
[01:25:30]  You got to fucking stop.  Yeah.  That's funny.  The jawbone of an ass.  God damn it.  God damn it.  Why don't you send it over to him first?  Let him punch it.  I really should.  The something.  I know.  Something.  Yeah.  He's talking about me talking about something stupid.  Same stupid thing.  He goes, the something that said dumb things.  Why don't you go get the patch today?  Just have one more cigarette, dude.  And know it's, it's, it's the summer.  You know what really fucked me up is I have two cartons at the house.  Oh, wow.  At a hundred.  Oh, yeah.  At how much money is that?  That's $120.  How much is one fucking, how much is, how much is fucking one gig you lose because you haven't 
[01:26:00]  fucking radiation?  Just, I mean, probably the same amount of money.  So I would say probably, you see something saying to me, she went a buck a week.  I was, get rid of the fucking cigarettes.  I'm such a dink.  I was doing the math in my head.  Yeah.  Like he was seriously asking me, you don't need to finish two more cartons.  You, you can quit.  After these cartons, I'm done.  Dude, that's the irrational part of it.  Is that, you know, my chick smokes.  So what?  I mean, it's like, that's what's always brought me back.  That always got me back smoking.  If I broke up with a girl, got with a new girl and she smoked, bam, I was smoking. 
[01:26:30]  You chick's a good girl.  It's even with food too.  No, she's a great, I'm fucking.  Ask her not to smoke in the house.  Here's the deal is that even with food, like she's been on my, my twat for the last three  weeks about what I eat.  No, you can't get that.  We have to get, and I hate it because I've been depressed and fucked up, you know, but  it's been working out.  But yesterday she, she was like, I want ice cream.  And I'm like, ding, ding, I'm like, okay, ice cream.  It's like drugs, man. 
[01:27:00]  And I'm like, well, go get one.  And I start manipulating, good.  Have an ice cream.  Live your life.  Come on.  Be happy.  If it's going to make you happy.  So she had an ice cream.  And then later that night I was like, I want an ice cream too.  And she's like, oh, and she felt bad because she already had one.  She's been a cunt to me about it.  So then she's like, she, she went, we went and go, I was okay for me to get an ice cream.  And this is what a fucking sicko I am.  We go down to get an ice cream.  She gets one cone, one scoop.  I come up with a bag and I'm lying. 
[01:27:30]  I'm like, she goes, what's in there?  I go, I just wanted to get a bag.  Cause we were walking the dogs in case I have to pick up shit.  I'll puke if I have an ice cream, you know, she's like, okay, we get home.  I take my ice cream out of the bag.  She goes, oh my God.  You just loaded up four scoops in a fucking giant vat.  Did you eat the whole fucking thing in one sitting?  No.  Of course you did.  Yes.  I can look, first of all, I don't think ice cream, I think I have a superhero power and 
[01:28:00]  ice cream doesn't affect me.  Oh, okay.  Because I can eat a gallon of ice cream and I don't feel like shit.  I can go right through it.  If I eat pizza, I feel like shit.  Chinese food.  I feel like any type of shit like that.  I feel like you feel like a fat fuck.  I've never eaten ice cream and felt bad about myself.  You're not supposed to eat so much ice cream that you feel full from it.  That's just it.  Like Chinese food, pizza, everybody eats to the point where they're like, yeah, one more  slice or, and you're like, oh, I'm packed.  You're never supposed to say that with ice cream. 
[01:28:30]  Ice cream is a dessert.  It's a little snack while you're watching TV or something and not an entire fucking container.  It's really like just liquid.  I mean, it melts.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just, it's like, it's like water.  Yeah.  It's just like water.  You know, if you have like, uh, like it's good for you, what you're saying?  Yeah.  It's a gallon of ice cream.  It's like a gallon of water.  It's just like a gallon of water.  How about you have some fucking frozen, like sugar-free stuff?  Like I always find stuff with low sugar.  So you can, you can eat.  It doesn't taste as good. 
[01:29:00]  It's not as good, but you know what?  It does help fucking kill some, like I eat these stupid 60 calories, sugar-free puddings.  I'm not saying they're great for you.  I have them.  But they're better than the ice cream alternative.  You know what I did last night?  I'm not a fucking great eater.  Yes, into my own mouth.  I made guppy noises.  No, I fucking do it.  This is what I did.  I bought some peanut butter, and I took one.  You got a dog?  I have to get that visual out of my fucking head.  I was pitching you with gills on the side of your cheeks.  Making guppy noises. 
[01:29:30]  I got one thing of peanut butter.  I took strings between us.  I took one scoop of fucking light peanut butter.  Just one small scoop of peanut butter.  A small teaspoon.  And then I just fucking ate.  It was gross, but it satisfied.  I had a fucking low-fat whipped cream, 60-calorie pudding, and I'm fucking dipping it in the  chocolate pudding, and then the whipped cream.  And I'm just like, your house is a party.  But I mean, it's opposed to eating a pudding.  A thousand calories of ice cream.  It's hard, Johnny, dude.  It's fucking hard.  And a hundred calories of jizz.  It's very hard. 
[01:30:00]  I realize the only reason.  My house is packed with goodies.  Yeah.  I have goodies all over my house.  You have a chip closet.  But I don't eat the fucking things.  Yeah.  It's an entire closet full of fucking chips and dips.  And then the candy.  There's like fucking...  And that just got restocked, by the way, so you'll love that.  Yeah, you'll have it just like Willy Wonka.  And fucking Hershey bars, like chocolate bars and stuff.  But the one thing that saves me is nothing goes good with beer. 
[01:30:30]  And if I'm going down to the bar area, and that's where like all the big glass jars of  chocolate is, I'm not going to grab a Hershey bar and a beer.  It just doesn't go together.  So I grab the beer.  Greatest rationalization I've ever heard.  I just rationalized why I'd rather have the beer.  I can't wait to hear that in an AA meeting someday.  I thought I was dieting.  Yes, I avoided the chocolate.  It's funny, too.  I go to Ant's house, and I always fucking feel...  I got to start bringing stuff there, because I go there, and fucking piggy tits runs right 
[01:31:00]  to Ant's fucking pantry.  I literally don't even acknowledge he's alive.  How long was it all, Ant?  Pat, Giff, Street!  Because I feel like I'm not going to get fat if I'm eating at stupid's counter.  I don't know why.  He's got candy everywhere.  He's got jars of candy.  I know.  There's like candy everywhere, and just nickety snacks everywhere.  15-year-olds and candy.  Big pool.  Candy.  Ant's house is a magical retreat. 
[01:31:30]  It really is.  It's amazing.  I mean, you're not more of a disaster than you are.  It is amazing you function at all.  Instead of flowers, he has 18-year-olds buried up to their neck with their pussies open like  a flower you can lick while you go by.  Like Rory Calhoun, you lock their heads off and fuck them.  Upside down, looking like an orchid.  Preservatives.  It's amazing Ant comes into work at all, though.  Like, literally, I would never have him come into work.  Believe me.  I don't know how you do it.  It's so hard to just leave.  Come on, stop touching me.  At any given moment, I would rather just be home.  Where are you this weekend?  This Friday night, I'm at Uncle Vinny's. 
[01:32:00]  How about Saturday?  Are you back in the city?  Saturday?  No.  I'm at SUNY Delhi.  Remember that gig?  Yeah, I didn't know it was a Saturday gig.  That gig.  We did this gig.  It's up college, way up in the middle of nowhere.  You either bomb or you do good.  I mean, I've seen people just eat.  I mean, bomb.  They fucking bomb.  It's a predominantly black audience.  I'd say, what, 70% black, maybe?  Yeah.  The SUNY Delhi?  Yeah, from the Bronx and Brooklyn, and they go up there, and they're usually cool, but  I did great up there, and I was so cocky. 
[01:32:30]  I was going up with Norton a long time ago, and I was middling, he was headlining, and  I was like, this is going to be fine.  I walk out, and I just said the wrong thing to this girl in the front row.  Did you drop the N-bomb?  Yeah.  Yeah, angrily while pointing in an accusing fashion.  I went, hey, what's up, Ashy?  You need some lotion, bitch.  Didn't he have cocoa butter?  Something stupid, and they just fucking, I was just bombing the whole time.  He goes up and just annihilates. 
[01:33:00]  And by the way, and anyone that knows Bobby and my act, in that situation, I never should  have, because I don't like going on after Bob.  In the cellar, I don't give a fuck, because you follow anybody.  But I don't want to go on.  I don't know how Gullman or Dane or any of these guys fucking follow me.  I've said to Dane, like, what the fuck's the matter?  Why would you bring him?  Yeah, don't bring Bob.  He's literally going to fucking, he's going to murder.  So, you know, you don't want to follow Bobby in those situations.  But that one, I was like, fuck.  And our friend Heather was there, who's a waitress from the cellar, who's, you know, 
[01:33:30]  it's her hometown.  It's like, you don't bomb in front of your fucking cute friend.  But if we did that a thousand times, 975 times, I would bomb after him.  And then 25 times out of a thousand, that would happen.  He fucking, he and I, I mean, really had a set.  And I'm saying, not, I love Norton.  I don't wish anything bad on him.  But as soon as you bomb, in your head, you're going, oh, he's going to fucking bomb, too.  Oh, please bomb, yeah.  I walk upstairs to the upstairs room, where you can look down on the stage in the theater. 
[01:34:00]  The guy just laughs at me, like, ha, ha, ha, like I bomb.  Yeah, he just starts laughing at me.  Because he doesn't give a shit, the guy who books it.  Of course.  He's just a great guy.  He's like, ha, ha, you suck.  I did one joke at the end that pulled it up at the last second.  I got a, ha, ha, ha.  And I went, good night, thank you.  Yeah.  And he goes, you pulled it up at the end there.  You were just crashing.  And then I look out, and Norton comes out.  And I'm like, let me watch this.  Because you don't want it to be you.  When both guys bomb, it's like the audience sucked.  Then the ride home is going to be awesome. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, that place, those motherfuckers.  They didn't give a shit.  Yeah, especially with Norton's rage and my going back for three and a half hours.  Just fucking, and all the fuck.  It would have been brilliant.  It would have been like music.  And he goes out and fucking annihilates.  I mean, really has a, one of the greatest sets I've seen up there.  Just kills it.  So the ride home must have been uncomfortable.  The ride home.  Oh, you did good too, Bob.  You did good too.  Oh, no, the ride home was great.  We fucking, I'm like, dude, do you mind if I can get some food?  He's like, I just want to get home.  I just want to get home. 
[01:35:00]  I'm like, yeah, I'm a little hungry.  I heard that, did I?  He goes, I just want to get home.  If we see something, we'll stop.  But I really wanted to get home.  Because it's a shit ride through the mountains and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then all of a sudden we see Triple X book shop on the other side of the highway.  And!  Really?  Cuts?  Were the cops cut over on the highway?  Yeah.  Uses that.  The no U-turn thing.  Yeah, uses that U-turn.  Goes in.  Now I'm starving.  I'm depressed.  I just ate my dick.  I'm in a bookstore.  And now I'm going to go eat a stranger's food.  I'm sitting there. 
[01:35:30]  I'm like, oh, I don't even know what the, I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I'm just trying to peruse porn, right?  And then he comes out, fucking motherfuckers.  He's angry.  And I'm like, I'm running out after him.  Like, what's wrong?  Are you all right?  He's like, fucking assholes.  Fucking, goddamn, cock sucking queer.  The guys kept, it was a gay jerk off booth.  Oh, shit.  So he went in to jerk off to some fucking porn.  The guys kept knocking on the door while he was in there.  Just, hey.  Hey.  And he's like, I'm in here.  I'm in here.  I know. 
[01:36:00]  I'm out here.  Hence the problem.  I vaguely remember that.  But fucking, believe me.  Hence the problem.  I doubt he said it like that.  He just yelled, let me suck your cock through the door.  He was one of the three musketeers.  When I went into a place like that, it was like J-Lo walking in.  They fucking, you can almost see the lights dim and a fucking spotlight go on me.  Young, nubile boy.  We all started doing a musical.  Oh, yeah.  They loved me.  You can sacrifice the sacros sitting in the back row. 
[01:36:30]  No, and actually walking.  I was going, ah, cha-cha.  Everybody wants to get into my mouth and asshole.  He really was a gem.  But he wouldn't stop for food.  Wouldn't stop for food.  The triple X plays, yeah.  I'm not kidding how the timing of this, I was like, dude, I'm really hungry.  Yeah, I just want to get home.  Really angry.  I'm like, all right, cool.  He's like, if I see something, I'll stop.  I don't remember that. 
[01:37:00]  Fucking right across, comes out, we're gone.  That's the night we went and we saw the guy.  We stopped at the McDonald's next.  Washing his dick in the sink.  Washing his dick in the sink.  Maybe he was down the road.  And then we sucked him off.  Me and Bobby walked into a rest area.  It was like one of them, whatever it was.  And we walk in, there's a guy standing.  He was probably a trucker.  Or he had just fucked somebody in the air.  He's standing at the sink with his dick in the sink, washing it.  He probably had just fucked either one of those lot lizards or whatever. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, you know what?  And his dick probably stunk.  Never thought of that.  He might have just fucked a lot.  Anthony's probably right.  You know what's great?  And then he sat to leave and just goes.  And realizes his dick is reeking over the diesel fumes.  He can't even smell the diesel fumes.  Smells like viper shit.  That was horrid pussy all over his dick.  But the best part, he penguined back to the stall.  That was...  With his pants around his ankles.  Yeah, he had to swing his hips from side to side. 
[01:38:00]  That is a guy that just doesn't give a shit.  Why care?  I don't remember that.  I remember that, but I remember him going back to the...  Why care?  Yeah, it was a fucked up night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  You don't have to wash the dick in the sink episode, but you do it in private, in a regular  bathroom.  Not in a public bathroom.  You ever had to do that, like, before you leave or something?  I've had to wash the dick, yeah.  Especially if you're somewhere you're not supposed to be.  If you have dogs, too, especially. 
[01:38:30]  I have dogs.  Oh, they'll come right up and fucking start sniffing like a drug dog.  Yeah, dogs will.  Yeah, dogs will.  If I jerk off...  You've got a kilo in your pants.  Yeah.  Yeah, if I jerk off, they'll fucking rat.  They'll come up.  Really?  Yeah, they did.  But if they smell like pussy on there, yeah.  Well, they smell like a hundred times more than whatever the fuck that stat that some  nerd just went.  It's a thousand times.  It's a thousand times.  I've got to type in.  Somebody call.  Sam, I want us to tell them.  It's a thousand times better than yours.  How many?  I don't know who we ever call it for you, Bob. 
[01:39:00]  It's a thousand times.  Fucking stupid.  Yeah, they'll fucking rat you out.  Wives should watch that, I guess, huh?  The husband comes home and the dog just sticks his fucking nose into the crotch.  Fuck yeah.  You want to know if your husband's cheating?  Get a shih tzu.  Get a shih tzu.  Why?  When he comes home and he's got fucking bacon in his crotch because the dog won't stop  smelling his asshole and balls.  That's fucking foreign pussy.  That's, uh, wow.  I never thought of that.  That's kind of a jigsaw. 
[01:39:30]  Now guys are just going to come home with real bacon in their fucking balls.  Yeah, here you go, boy.  What are you?  Did you fuck somebody?  No, I just dropped a Cobb salad in my shorts.  Look, I brought some bacon home for the dog.  It's like throw him off the hook.  Like in a video game when you got to get the guard dogs off of you.  It's like go to the room, put in the combo, get the steak from the fridge, throw it  to the dogs.  You got to come home with fucking bacon and throw it around your house.  So you'd leave a trail as you'd run to the shower and wash that whore off your dick.  Yeah, kibbles and tits or something. 
[01:40:00]  See, that's funny, Chip.  Not really.  I fucking hate Chip.  Oh, we do have a, from what I hear, there's a chip, a new chip production piece.  That's right.  Ooh.  Chip getting just oh so famous.  Well, Chip's very sexy and a lot of the women want to fuck Chip's brain out.  Really?  Yeah.  Women want to fuck Chip.  You bet they do.  Women love imitating Chip to annoy their significant others.  Yeah, apparently.  They found a new way to just bug the shit out of their loved one.  I can't wait until I make chips out of my wife's teeth. 
[01:40:30]  What's that?  Next time she does it.  You like Chip?  Yeah.  How about this?  Whammo.  Ice chips or something, right, Bobo?  Oh, God.  Bobo.  Fuck.  Oh, Bobo.  I hate when he enhances the character.  Every day he makes it more real and real.  Bobo, fuck off.  Less chip.  More real and less funny.  I think we're going to have Amy Schumer coming in, too.  Ah, the lovely Amy Schumer.  Yeah, she's into me. 
[01:41:00]  Well said, Sam.  She is, Chip.  I know she is.  I don't think so, Chip.  Yeah.  Amy Schumer.  She'll be Amy later instead of sooner.  I messed up.  Amy.  Amy's the best.  She got me a picture with Ad-Rock in Montreal.  She is fucking.  Oh, from the She's Your Boy?  She's fearless.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ad-Rock comes out of the fucking elevator.  Amy's with her, this other comic, and she comes out.  You know, Amy's a real pretty girl, too, you know?  She's a fucking pretty girl with a sense of humor. 
[01:41:30]  Where does that come from?  Molestation.  Yeah, yeah.  Only hope.  But she comes out, oh, my God.  I plan on making some comedians.  Your history so far, I think you've fucking, I think you've caused eight Roseannes, one  Rita Rudner, and a Latifah.  So, yes, she's coming.  She is great.  But she got me, she goes, Ad-Rock said, I'm like, oh, give me a picture.  She ran, like, to the elevator and went, hold the elevator, and faked like she was getting 
[01:42:00]  on to go to the floor.  And then we all got on the elevator.  And I, oh, what a shitty, I just, I caught his eye, tried to look away because I didn't  want to, I wanted to pretend I, I just recognized him, but I already saw him, and I fucking  kept it, I just kept going with it.  And then I turned around again, I went, hey.  I literally did a circle.  I saw him, went to the ground, came back, action, hey, you. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God, who is it?  And then my, I go, can I get a picture?  He goes, absolutely.  And then my wife goes, oh, this is creepy.  Like, out loud.  I go, shut the fuck up.  Yes, stop.  I'm in a moment here.  He goes, no, I'm creepy, too.  You take the picture.  And I got the picture.  Oh, it was a fucking brilliant picture.  That's, in an elevator, they usually say yes, because it's like no one else is around.  Yeah.  Well, I was nose to nose, and I had him in the corner of the elevator, so.  Yeah.  That's awkward.  We take a picture.  Me and Kenny followed Springsteen onto an elevator back into the building. 
[01:43:00]  That's how I got my picture of Springsteen.  We followed him onto an elevator.  It was me, Kenny, Bruce, and his guy.  And he knew.  Of course he did.  You followed him in the elevator.  Dude, we followed, it was the same thing.  We followed him on, and I'm just like, hey, Bruce, take a picture.  He's like, yeah, man, he just worked out.  He didn't care, and we fucking went up to his floor, and he goes, you guys got to hit  a button or something, because he got off, and we had no buttons.  We just rode back down.  I'd point to the camera in the corner and go, ask the security guy for a picture, because  he's got them all downstairs by the desk.  I don't like that you would think that you'd be like that guy that would point and say 
[01:43:30]  that.  No, you wouldn't.  You're a nice guy.  No, I said Bruce should have said that, maybe.  Like, hey, it's on security.  Wow.  The chip piece?  We should have went to the chip piece.  That's all right.  Your fucking goddamn mustache almost fell off on that one.  Wow.  That's all right.  No, they should have pointed.  Hey.  Should we break or no?  Pilot to Bombardier.  Pilot to Bombardier.  Yes, we will break with this.  And Amy will be in shortly.  Yes, Amy.

[01:45:30]  Hi there.  This is Troy, phone screener for the Opie and Anthony Show, here to help you with a helpful tip.  When calling into the radio show, it's a good idea that you turn your radio down.  ONA, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Yeah, make sure Opie knows.  We don't know shit from shit.  Turn your radio down.  What?  I can't hear you.  I'm in the air.  Hey, asshole.  Am I live right now?  Hey, turn your radio down.  Hey, you.  Turn your radio down.  All right, thanks, man.  Punch it out.  See?  Wasn't that easy.  It gets you on the air faster, and it makes you a better caller. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, and if you want to call the show, just look down at your radio.  Yeah, right there.  Take your eyes off the road and look down.  See the number?  Just call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Thank you, and have a nice day.  Sirius XM, the virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh.  Any reason we're playing ACDC? 
[01:46:30]  Is it an anniversary?  Nope.  Nothing.  Something?  No.  You just decided that was a good song.  Yeah.  And I agree.  This is good.  I have to say about Bobby's cough.  She wore the bad machine to get the motor clean.  She was the best damn woman I have ever seen.  We only have the loop that keeps going and going.  Amy.  I can do an Amy.  Amy Schumer.  Good morning.  You didn't like my joke?  I said this song's about Bob's cough.  I should be all night long.  We heard you.  No, it's a good one.  Oh, God. 
[01:47:00]  It's cute.  I don't know.  I just read your shirt, too.  Gut Mule.  What the fuck?  Hi, Amy.  Hi.  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  You look gorgeous.  All of you.  Yeah.  We really, we gussied ourselves up today because we knew you were coming in.  And it's like a Persian eye this morning.  Yeah, yeah.  I love what you did over there.  It's fantastic.  Fabulous.  I want it to look like Pharaoh.  That is exactly what you look like.  I was talking to you about your Twitter account.  I saw a tweet that said, my Twitter account got hacked. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Sorry if you got like something.  Yeah.  And all I'm thinking is, that's a great excuse if you get a little hammered and tweet something  you're not supposed to.  Right.  And then you just go, shit, that was hacked.  And I know, you know, Wiener tried that.  But that's like sending a picture and think, if you say something inappropriate on Twitter,  you could absolutely get away with it like once and go, I was hacked.  Are there any hackers that just want to like drop the N word all over Twitter?  No, they usually, it's usually to hack more people. 
[01:48:00]  That would be, let me tell you, I just want to, in advance, head this off to the pad and  say, whoever hacks my account, that's what they'll do.  Okay, that's true.  That is absolutely what they would do.  Well, they're going to hack it in your voice.  Yes.  Yes.  So.  Yes.  And if they hack, you know, my dumb basement show or anything on video, YouTube accounts,  it's always going to be that guy.  Yep.  Well, actually, sometimes Keith, the cop, if he comes in my house and sees my computer  open, he'll check and see if I left the Twitter open, Facebook, and just put horrific things 
[01:48:30]  on there.  Well, that's because he cares about you.  He really cares.  It's mostly about gay sex, though.  Some type of gay sex thing that I've been engaged in.  Oh, okay.  Something I had no clue about.  So he's reporting the truth.  Well, that's a friend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just trying to get me out, open myself up, let people know who I am.  Yeah.  And so I don't have to live this lie anymore.  No.  Mm-hmm.  No.  We accept you.  Yes.  Thank you.  What did they do to your Twitter account? 
[01:49:00]  What did they do?  They just, oh, Jimmy, loud.  There's a girl in here.  I'm a lady, Jim.  I'm wearing a skirt today.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  I just queefed.  Let's see what smells worse.  I didn't say that.  I'm going to win this one.  I'm going to win this one.  This round, Schumer.  Oh, pennies versus flounder.  I could be both.  They both give us a long cum. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, my God.  Mine smells like my dad.  I'm confused.  I'm confused.  Yeah.  They didn't do anything interesting.  They didn't do anything bad?  No.  Nothing really.  It was lame.  It was a lame one.  Yeah.  Do you tend to tweet more if you've been drinking?  On the sauce?  For sure.  Yeah.  I just realized you can delete tweets.  Yeah.  That's been helpful.  Probably.  Yeah.  But if someone copies it first, then you're like...  Then you're kind of...  And then everyone knows you deleted it. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then it's like, oh, I see.  Yeah.  You're embarrassed by it.  And then...  Because I notice I do tweet a lot after I have a few.  I notice that, too, about you.  Yes.  Yes.  At like 3 a.m. on a Friday or a Saturday night.  Oh, every other tweet's mine.  It's amazing.  Yours is always a retweet, too.  You have a lot...  Like what the guy said and then your response.  Yes.  Yes.  Because I don't really tweet a lot of my own stuff.  I take other people's stuff and then I yell at it.  Yes.  I get very... 
[01:50:30]  I'm a fun guy to hang out with when I've been drinking.  Just ask Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Oh, he's a ball of...  A really good time.  Sometimes you don't hear the same story.  You're like, I want to hear that 80 more times to make 100% sure I got it.  I really do just...  You retweet yourself in conversation.  In conversation.  It's like being at fucking Billy Batts' party.  I kind of like it.  I don't get what's fucking coming to me.  Just you're in shorts with a gun.  Oh, my God.  That's how I picture you.  Well, not in the pool, though.  No, not in the pool. 
[01:51:00]  Pool, you got to put the gun up by the edge of the pool.  Yeah, sure.  That way, if any, you know, undesirables...  No, actually, if any, unruly teens, as I've been noticing in the paper, they just call  criminals unruly teens.  They should have been at your house.  They'd just be looking for their girlfriends.  Yeah.  It's like you're dating.  Pull in.  Unruly teens.  Well, yeah.  I know why you hang out in the pool.  You don't need your gun there, because you know everyone in there will be white.  That's true, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just...  If anything happened, I would just have to go to the deep end and go, ha, ha. 
[01:51:30]  What are you going to do?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Try to get me.  Yeah.  We get it, Anthony.  No, that's trouble.  Trouble swimming.  Yeah.  Can't swim.  But I'm not an angry drunk.  I might repeat my stories 80 times and laugh a little too hard at things and talk too loudly.  But I'm home, so I don't care.  But I don't get nasty.  I'm not like a nasty drunk, but with Twitter, I will get really nasty reading someone's 
[01:52:00]  tweet and then retweeting it.  I have to be like, yeah, your mother's fucking cunt stinks.  Right.  And it's like, really, why did I have to...  Why would I write that?  Well, you wanted them to know.  Yeah.  That's like the literal ones, which are occasionally that happens.  Yeah.  You're like, I have to tell you this.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to have to tell you this here, but...  I know your mom, and her cunt does indeed smell.  Yeah.  But sometimes someone will just say something like, you know, you suck, and then I'll put  your mom's cunt smell down.  I don't even really know.  Oh, mom's cunt smell, though.  Zach, come on. 
[01:52:30]  They have to.  Oh, they've had babies.  They haven't had sex.  Yeah.  Your dad's dirty fingers in them.  He's a mechanic.  It's like when you buy an old car, the back seat just smells musty, like ghosts.  There's a new car smell and an old car smell, yeah.  Mom's cunt's an old car smell?  That one.  That one.  Mom's cunt is an old car smell.  It doesn't matter how many of those pine tree freshens do you jam in there.  I'm 30, so where would I be in the car?  28.  Yeah, you'd be a new...  You'd be a...  Well, to continue talking, if you're talking to him... 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  For him, I'm like Tales from the Crypt.  I'm like the Crypt's Keeper.  Your pussy has vines on it.  Oh, the second the hair grows in, that holds the smell.  I'm done.  Oh, God.  Put down the rattle.  Come with Papa.  Yeah, just get over here.  Oh, God.  No.  His dream is a girl with two baby arms.  I'd be like, yes.  That's great.  It's legal, and it works for me.  Yeah, nothing better than seeing a hand grab your cock with those inverted knuckles.  A pussy that never grew.  Oh, God. 
[01:53:30]  I hate tiny pussies on adult women.  What?  No, it's fucking awful.  Really?  You don't like the bird lips.  You don't like bird lips.  Sometimes they're really tiny.  Oh, they're awful.  Yeah, like a little underdeveloped pussy.  What?  It's called a guy's asshole.  Yeah.  That's what he really means.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Eat my pussy, Norm.  I don't think I've ever seen a...  Like, what do you mean?  The lips themselves aren't fat?  Yeah, they're just thin.  Or the slit itself?  He doesn't like...  He likes big pussy lips.  No, no, but I mean...  I'm not even big pussy lips.  Inside?  Yeah, just sometimes just pussies are dumb looking. 
[01:54:00]  It's like shallow.  It's like a belly button.  Yeah, it's just like, what is that?  It ends?  Or like a puppet on Avenue Q?  It's like an eye.  What do you mean dumb looking?  It's like an eye.  It's like an eye.  Really?  It's just not quite...  I like a package...  I like...  He likes the big pussy lips.  I like the...  I like a little pussy lip or the package pussy.  And you open it and there's some lips.  I don't like big, huge pussy lips.  No, he likes the explosion at the Steakums factory look.  He wants to feel like it could swallow him up.  Yeah, yeah.  A very Venus flytrap pussy. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I want it to look like a fucking...  Like the end of an arm after a hand has been ripped off in a grinder.  Oh, God, that's so awful.  Oh, my God.  That's the type of cunt I like.  Oh, Chip.  Come on now.  I had one...  I almost threw up.  I had one of those...  I guess they can open up their pussies if they control the...  What?  What?  It's just...  Oh, like they could do it with their mind?  Wow, that's fucked up.  Yeah, it's a superhero power.  Yeah.  Wait, I'm doing it.  Nobody talks.  Oh, wow. 
[01:55:00]  Nobody talks.  I need to focus.  Okay, it's shut.  It's shut.  I just was going to say something, but sometimes you know it's just going to bomb.  Oh, thank God.  Wait, so you saw a girl opening and closing it with her, like using the force?  Yeah.  She fucked a guy before me with a big, big cock.  Really big cock.  How soon before?  Like three seconds?  Like during.  Like you just pulled out?  Here's the deal.  You cuckled?  Here's the deal.  Back in the day, I banged this chick with a friend of mine, but his dick was just fucking 
[01:55:30]  gigantic.  It was like the thing holding this microphone up.  A mic boom.  With the microphone.  You mean black?  He was black, yes.  Thank you, Amy.  I didn't want to say it.  Okay, well, that's why I'm here.  They are black, though, the boom.  I'm telling you, he's fucking.  He walked in.  We were hanging out.  He walked in, and we both went, wow.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, I had to get, like, I.  You got to watch how you say wow at a guy's cock.  Yeah, you're getting excited.  If it's amazing, it's like, wow, that's big, or wow, hmm. 
[01:56:00]  Well, hello.  It wasn't a sing-songy fag.  I had to go, wowie, wowie, wee, wee.  Hey, big spender.  No, it was, I told him, I go, dude, I'm not gay, but I'm going to look at your cock for  at least 10 more seconds, because I've never seen a dick like this in my life, not even  on a fucking move, like, holy shit.  Well, let's hear more about this.  Yeah, so he laid into her.  He wound up fucking her, and she was, I almost, I was, I was supposed, you know, when you do 
[01:56:30]  a two, a threesome, you're supposed to get, one guy gets.  Two girls?  One guy gets head.  Exactly.  One guy gets head, and the other one fucks her.  You stay away, and then you make goofy faces at each other.  You're supposed to go, you know, high five once in a while, and then go back to  to, ooh, ooh, ha ha, you know.  Maybe in junior high.  What are you doing?  But he, he was fucking her.  I would play one-on-one Texas Hold'em on her back with your pal.  Uno.  Throwing cards down, flop, smacking on her sweaty back, sticking. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  You have a dealer.  Yeah.  Now that's a threesome.  That is the real deal.  One in the, one in the pussy, one in the mouth, she's on all fours, a dealer, and you're  just playing cards on her back.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  And the river.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, that's going to hurt.  I'm all in.  What?  No, my cock.  30 to the balls, I'm all in.  Oh, my God.  So you're, you're, you're tag-teaming. 
[01:57:30]  You're making up handshakes.  She, she, she, she was screaming like she was being murdered.  Like, really, like, I was, I was kind of looking down, like, concerned.  Do you need help?  But you're still, like, making her, like, fucking her face.  Are you okay?  Tell, like, just raise a hand.  Raise an arm.  Yeah, yeah.  Listen, lick my nose.  Mumbling around my fucking dick like Muggsy talking around a cigar.  Tap on my balls three times with your tongue if you need help.  My pussy hurts, see? 
[01:58:00]  So he's banging her bad.  Yeah, but he, I kind of backed out of it at one point.  I got a little, for me to get uncomfortable, I can handle some freaky shit.  But I got a, I was like, eh, fuck it.  And I backed away because she was real, she couldn't even blow me anymore because she was  going, ah, ouch, oh, help, police, dad.  So I backed off.  Yeah.  I came off.  And he wound up banging her doggy style, like, on the couch. 
[01:58:30]  And I went in the other room and I kind of took my shit, you know, my rubber, you know,  all the shit that I had on.  I was like, eh, fuck it.  Rubber.  And I came back out.  Galoshes, he means.  I would assume.  He's wearing rain gear.  Oh, Mike Vecchione wears galoshes when it rains out to cover his sneakers.  His feet should be chopped off.  He's from the past.  He's from the sneakers?  He's from the past.  That fucking barrel-chested Superman douchebag.  Is he OCD?  No, he's just a fuck.  He's fucking dumb.  I don't want to get my sneakers dirty. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, fuck off.  They're $60.  Yeah.  Stop it.  It's a shit.  What happened?  I got to know.  So, he was on the couch.  He backed away from her and she was on all fours on the couch, kind of leaning up against  the wall.  And she felt bad for me.  I was still naked and I walked in and she went, come on.  And she kind of looked at her ass, like, come fuck it.  Come on, try.  And I looked at it and it was like, you could see inside.  Oh, it had been...  You could, like, see her ovaries.  What was that? 
[01:59:30]  What was the monster in Star Trek?  The sand monster?  Oh, I don't know.  I was raised by my biological parents.  What was it?  Star Wars.  Star Wars.  Sorry, Star Wars.  Yeah, yeah.  The thing they tried to land on, but then they flew out?  That could be that one or the one.  The sand monster that...  Yeah, yeah.  That was a job...  A job of the huts.  A little fucking...  You know any worm monster, how they have the...  Any worm monster.  If they have the mouth inside of the mouth?  Yes.  Yes.  Like a mullet fish.  Yes.  If you Google mullet fish, if you look inside...  They have a mouth and then another mouth and then a mouth. 
[02:00:00]  That's what her pussy looked like.  The sarlacc pit.  Apparently, we're getting a lot.  People know it's the sarlacc pit.  So, she had sarlacc pussy.  Those people should light their fucking...  What did you do?  What did you do, Bobby?  They've never seen real pussies.  Well, now they know what pussy looks like.  It looks like a sarlacc.  You fucking geeks.  I almost threw up.  Because I have a weak stomach, but I put it in and my dick is not...  I have a six-inch dick.  That's all I have.  You're just like putting a camera in there to look around. 
[02:00:30]  Like grandma hitting the triangle for dinner time.  Bob can actually put his cock in another cock hole.  And see...  Prostates.  Put a camera on it, like, on scientific purposes.  Yeah, it's like inner space.  Yeah, and then tag it.  Put a national grip and tag on it so we can follow this cunt around the fucking world.  That is brutal.  Fucking black guys in hotels.  She, uh...  Did you, uh... 
[02:01:00]  I almost...  It opened itself up like it...  Like a...  What is it?  The pro...  What the thing you should...  The pro...  Like a prolapsed...  Prolapsed vagina.  Vagina.  It opened up.  And it looked like a fucking monster.  It was huge.  Wow.  Huge.  Big, fat pussy lips.  Ugh.  Jimmy's like, yeah.  Big, fat, big, meaty...  I think that's the storyline for the next Sex in the City.  All of their pussies just prolapse.  And they feed each other peanuts with it like an elephant's trunk. 
[02:01:30]  And it's from a pepper spill.  They all start sneezing.  And the force of the sneeze is pushing the vagina out.  All their organs fall out on the floor.  Yes.  Yes.  And then they have to get a vaginal mesh.  And it doesn't work, so they call the lawyers from TV.  Our cunt falls out like a foot going through ice.  Yes.  Well, let me tell you something.  My pussy just fell out.  I am so a Samantha.  Oh, God.  Which one are you now? 
[02:02:00]  Girls, if we have to pick each one, that's from Sex in the City.  Who are you like?  I'm the redhead.  You're the lesbian.  I'm the cunty redhead.  Oh, gosh.  I'd have to say Samantha, too.  Oh, no.  But we can't up to Samantha's.  We can't up to Samantha's.  So we'll have to kill one off.  Okay.  Fucking ick.  They're making another one, though.  No, they're not.  Jodorowsha tweeted yesterday that he's happy that they're making.  And seriously.  What's wrong with him?  He's an idiot.  He's Egyptian. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that must be it.  That's the problem.  He probably liked the last one where they went to Egypt.  They went to his homeland.  They're like, oh, let's ride this camel from the underside.  Get it, I fuck animals.  Every scene he was looking for his real parents.  Are you my mother?  Oh, my God.  Fuck that.  Anyone wearing heavy eyeliner, Joe's like, mom?  He doesn't know his real parents?  Anybody who's really tired.  Oh, wait.  I don't know if he knows his real parents.  I don't think so.  No, he doesn't.  He was adopted.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:03:00]  He was adopted.  They're very nice.  They're very great.  They're great people.  Of course they are.  Wouldn't that be amazing if he was from royalty and had billions of dollars in oil and they  just gave him away?  Those shoulders can only come from inbreeding.  I'll tell you, he's probably royalty.  Yeah, he probably is.  It was probably like a Spartan thing.  He was born and they looked and went, we can't keep this one.  Throw him back.  Instead of throwing him off that Sparta cliff, they just kind of give him away.  This guy, I guarantee you this cock side, if that happened, he would dump his real parents 
[02:03:30]  in a second.  They're the sweetest people in the world.  By email.  And just like, yeah, go on back to...  He'd dump them by Twitter and then not even on Twitter.  Oh, he'd turn into just a raging anti-Semite.  He'd be gone.  Turn into?  Oh, that's bad.  Oh, God.  But seriously, he looks like an earthworm.  He's actually going to the gym now, so he's actually...  Really?  Nothing has changed.  Buffing up.  Oh, that's it.  He's buffing up.  He's great on Louie.  He enhanced no shoulders. 
[02:04:00]  On the table.  Yeah.  Table read.  Oh, he was really funny on there.  You know what was really good?  He was great.  Yeah.  The Dane Cook one was fucking great.  Yeah.  Dane was good.  Jimmy was great on that.  Jimmy was great on that.  I believed you were an awkward pervert.  I really bought it.  And Stanhope was fucking amazing.  Oh, my God.  Stanhope was...  That was great.  It was a really good episode.  The only funny parts were during the stand-up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because everything else was just so dark and tragic.  You were great on that, Bobby. 
[02:04:30]  The whole season's been like that, though.  Like, it's just been a fucking dark show.  Yeah.  But Stanhope was...  I can't believe how...  He was a really good actor.  He was...  I mean, no fucking joke acting.  He was really...  That scene was fucking brilliant.  That was a really great scene.  Yeah.  He put across that he was that guy.  And we all kind of know...  I don't know if you...  I mean, you're younger than me.  I'm 40.  But I know that guy.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I know...  I spent time with Stanhope, yeah.  Or you mean, like, that guy. 
[02:05:00]  Well, I mean, that guy.  Oh, that guy.  Who's run his course, and he should kill himself.  Yeah, like, who you have...  Hey, man, what's going on?  And you see them at the Comedy Cellar.  You've hung out with...  You are that guy.  You just haven't realized you should alter yourself yet.  Bobby, this is actually an intervention for your life.  I saw Jimmy's eyes going back and forth.  Oh, would he get that idea?  And I'm like, he's not listening to me.  And then they open wide.  Yeah.  Like a lizard seeing a mosquito.  It's like that cat clock.  And then it comes out.  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't know Doug had that in him. 
[02:05:30]  He really did a great job acting.  Unbelievable.  Really good.  Yeah, that's why I was thinking maybe...  That's a little close to him.  Like, I don't want to give him credit for being such a good actor.  I'm just like, well, well, I guess Doug's going to kill himself.  Right.  Because that's...  No.  Doug's not...  I mean...  He's happy.  I don't know him.  Probably Jimmy knows him.  I don't know him well.  I've met him a couple of times.  But he's not like...  He's kind of, you know, hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  He's kind of out, you know, hey, what's up, fuckers?  He's like, what's up?  No, no.  He's actually a pretty reserved, mellow guy.  Yeah, reserved dude.  Even when he came in here a couple of times.  I mean, he's... 
[02:06:00]  He's a fucking wacko.  We were roommates in the Vail Comedy Festival.  He sleeps with all his possessions on the bed.  What?  Doug had all of his fucking stuff on it.  We were roommates in the Vail Comedy Festival in 95.  All right, that's a little crazy.  Or 96.  And Doug sleeps on his bed.  All of his shit was on his bed with him.  What do you mean all of his shit?  Describe his shit.  That's because you were in the room with him, Jimmy.  I would do the same thing.  I don't want to get jizz on all my stuff.  I don't want to get hooker shit on my fucking toothbrush and my DVD player. 
[02:06:30]  Fucking cum flying like an old 60s sprinkler.  Yeah, that was the only time he's ever done that.  Yeah, he never does that.  That was just...  You sleep cum.  He's like...  So do you.  He's good.  He likes drinking.  He's awesome.  He does like to party.  That's one thing I've known from him.  He's not afraid of a great time.  I think, yeah, Rogan introduced us to him initially. 
[02:07:00]  Because I guess they know each other.  He won these...  And Rogan likes his...  He won the San Francisco comedy.  It was him and Dane.  I remember that's when I first heard about him.  Dane.  Dane Cook.  Taylor.  I was in Boston.  Dane went out to San Fran.  It was him and Stanhope in the finals for the...  And Stanhope beat him.  Yeah, Stanhope was living in his car while the competition was going on.  And he wound up fucking winning and, you know, getting his shit together. 
[02:07:30]  That's kind of a living in the car thing, like the character.  Yeah.  Maybe there was a little Stanhope in there.  I'm sure.  Maybe he isn't that good a fucking actor.  Well, he doesn't live in a car now, dickhead.  He's got a house.  Just kidding.  He's got a house in Arizona.  Yeah.  Arizona.  Who can't have a house in Arizona?  Yeah.  That's true.  I'm going to be like 10 bucks.  I know.  $4 a square foot for land in Arizona.  Fucking great.  That infuriates me when I pick up a paper and you see ads like for houses in Arizona 
[02:08:00]  or Colorado or some fucking place you'll never live.  No, thanks.  And I'm going to...  I can't fucking...  I can literally have like a Waco compound kind of a thing.  You see your house for $8.  Yeah.  Same exact house.  Same house, only on 100 acres of land.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't move to Arizona though because in the summer it gets like, fuck you hot.  It's crazy hot.  Yeah.  You can't walk outside and bare feet because the tar will stick to you.  But who cares? 
[02:08:30]  Why is that the thing you want to do?  Well, because you don't...  I mean, that's fucking hot, hot.  You turn the air conditioner on, you're in your house, you have a pool, and then you  fucking...  You never go out.  That sounds like my life.  And I live in New York.  But you can shoot shit right in your backyard.  There you go.  That would be cool, yeah.  I smile on that.  If you could kill coyotes and lizards.  I have to wait for intruders in order to do that now.  Accidentally shoot Jimmy.  Why would you want to shoot me?  Because you look like a...  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Not Jimmy. 
[02:09:00]  Ta-ta-ta.  That's my new guy.  Ta-ta-ta.  Hey, we have this girl showing up.  What's her name?  This wingman thing?  She's a wingwoman.  Marnie.  Marnie?  Kenry?  Marnie?

[02:10:00]  better time looking at the ads in the back of some of the porno than i did the actual you wanted  you wanted a hovercraft popular mechanics i'm jerking off too but like sometimes they would  show uh like blowjobs and stuff in a little thumbnail yeah before we knew what thumbnails  meant um and that was kind of better than some blurry fucking playboy picture yeah of some girl 
[02:10:30]  with a giant butch they always put the the fucking a little uh obscure dirty little edgier ads in the  back yeah in the back and that was the ones we like we used to jerk off to photos photographs i  haven't jerked off to a photo in 20 years yeah try it do it right now go ahead and and there's  elizabeth taylor oh there you go liz taylor how hot was she boy did you pick the worst photo in there  though you you could it was it was jerking off the photos and mostly just photos of nude girls 
[02:11:00]  there wasn't like a sex act going on if you could get one of those magazines i remember a very rarely  you'd you'd hit pay dirt and get those magazines they had about eight pages in them they were all  thick like glossy pages of uh blowjobs and penetration and that was just the insta fucking hard on well  you had to pretend you had to actually that's why they're all holding you would pretend the centerfold  was for you to hold up and pretend that you were fucking her point of view yeah it was point of view 
[02:11:30]  shot yeah you i used to hold them up and have to fantasize and look at her and then look at her  and look back and forth until i created this video in my  oh baby and then you cut in oh you like that you had nickelodeon eyes going  were you ever surprised when you look at the picture and it was it was frowning  sorry i just stepped on you for that mediocre joke  i liked it i like that it looks disappointed when you're done it's like i don't remember her face 
[02:12:00]  being like that when i started yeah why does she have vomit on her collar oh  oh god i mean i uh you accidentally jerk off to that uh huh is that a rhino those are big  sheep balls oh that's look at that that see this is the stuff i'd find like in the thing that i  would yeah a little two chicks kind of yeah this one's a little dirty she's got a little japanese  tattoo there was a magazine um an old hustler years ago and a buddy of mine was like check this 
[02:12:30]  out dude it's the first ever scratch and sniff and leave it to hustler yeah and they had a scratch  and sniff vagina centerfold and you scratch and and sniff and i refused to uh to do it why because i  just didn't want to know i was a kid at the time and and yeah it was it was pre uh i had never seen  or would they use old potato skins hey now hey stop being accurate 
[02:13:00]  no i didn't know and i didn't want to like it just freaked me out was it just perfume or something  like that i don't know to this day i don't know what it was to this day is there pussy perfume do  they have that if they do the cab drivers here wear it rank pussy perfume uh and and then finally  when i was uh with with a woman for the first time with woman um he said that in quotes and said 
[02:13:30]  with woman for the first time actually woman uh yeah it was and it wasn't the first time i was with  her she was the first one i was with so it was probably two or three times since i had first had  sex and and then she started wanting to delve in just a little deeper you know so she turns around  and gives me a blowjob and i'm like oh this is great this feels really nice and then she was like  well you know you could do that to me i'm like what you don't have a cock no no i did not say  that but uh i was just like oh no no i was just petrified oh yeah it was big black hairy like 
[02:14:00]  very coarse black hair pussy and and and like and just a meat cleaver whack in the middle of it  and the thought of putting my face in there was just i didn't want to do it i i i you know i made up  for later oh let me tell you ladies oh wow you really got hurt pussy is something you have to  you have to get used to and you have to you have to do it you get used to it but it's not something  you initially go i fucking it's awful you know what helps it's wet booze the second i had a few 
[02:14:30]  drinks i was down there like it was me at it cotton candy i don't think i could do it ever  no it's it's fucking crazy it's a fucking hole in somebody's body that's wet it's weird because  we never see our own pussies so like there's no reason for it they have the app they have the  pussy now they have the pussy app and i just saw mine for the first time you hold your camera under  and it fucking it leaks on it like when fucking alien was looking at sigourney weaver 
[02:15:00]  oh god the slime just comes dripping out the second set of teeth comes and rips your fucking  heart out it's like your pussy sneezed on your fucking camera oops a daisy oops a daisy it is  daunting though uh to to want to to do that especially the first time ever uh you're just  kind of young and you don't know what the fuck is going on and and i just i i didn't have any  confidence either that i would know anything about that area at all do you ever try to lick 
[02:15:30]  inside uh i didn't know that you were supposed to hey lick around the clit the pussy put a finger  i tried to get i thought you had to get in your tongue get as deep in there as possible  rookie mistake licking the bottom of a starfish just fucking inside it's all bumpy yes your head  up against there trying to get your tongue as deep inside it's like what are you doing sour  you're like that's not gonna it's sour what are you it's like the end of a t-bone steak when  you're trying to get that meat off the bone you can't get in that little crevice 
[02:16:00]  so you just break her legs like you would a fucking t-bone of course break her legs that's um  uh yeah it just it was a daunting task you've never you've never had a sexual experience with a  woman no jimmy um jimmy no no i haven't no but i would think i would like i've been attracted to  girls but uh i couldn't i cannot imagine yeah that doesn't go sexual though no it goes i'll feel 
[02:16:30]  like something but it doesn't i just i cannot imagine like dealing with somebody's pussy yeah  not imagine it yeah believe us it's not something that you like to do at first it's something you  have to do well hearing you say that was encouraging robert i thought maybe no i could get into it but  i don't know see that i don't i don't believe that because it i think it's it's great it's good fun  now you do fucking great first yeah now no no no when you first did it it's terrifying it was it was  but it was it was more a confidence thing i think than a i'm disgusted thing you know you just didn't 
[02:17:00]  think you'd do a good job yeah i didn't want to be bad at it you know so i kind of avoided the  whole situation a lot of guys that's why you don't like you have to just show them what they  should be doing if they make that rookie mistake if they try and fuck you with their tongue and you're  like oh we got a first timer in here this is cute you just you just sit on him like you know like  you're a hat you just kill him yeah you suffocate him with your clit what are you trying to get at  in there there's nothing in there for you girl a lot of girls don't say listen lighter 
[02:17:30]  some girls like it hard some girls like uh the clit suck light very light some girl there's all  kinds of there's a way though that a guy is supposed to pick up body language and subtle moans and stuff  to let them know like maybe that's a little too much maybe that's not enough like some the second  she's got to actually vocalize and go could you fucking you know move it up about a quarter of an  inch it's the same thing i use it's the same thing i use when girls get near my assholes 
[02:18:00]  oh god god god god god god yes yes yes yes and then they go back up to my dick and i stop talking  subtle body language like fucking doing the hula dance is uh yeah it's kind of what they go to my  balls to my eyes it's like yes yes oh god oh god yes yes oh eat my pussy eat my pussy  that's how they know you gotta let them know subtly no it's little clues i give a thumbs up or  thumbs down is that it like big thumbs down the whole time you gotta occasionally look up yeah 
[02:18:30]  and see amy just going like a japanese mma fan  nah nah yeah but i think it would be good if girls i like when girls go listen let's do it soft do this  do that because then i just want to make it come yeah it saves time why not you know throw the guy  but it does feel good as a guy if you get no vocal direction and you're able to just steer it in on  instruments yeah like that you know norton's i mean i'm not going smoking your ass phenomenal yes 
[02:19:00]  he really hasn't he i've tried to do it but my tongue i guess you have to have fucking  lizard in you or just not constantly have food getting in the way that was a back-to-backer  that was a road that was a log jam of fuck you jokes i had he he saw one coming out and he fucking  no he he is really good at fucking eating pussy how do you know that yeah i've heard uh-huh 
[02:19:30]  because i've drawn pussy lips on my asshole  and he's done the technique on a hemorrhoid  yeah you have a technique that you use yeah it's where i'll stick my tongue out like this like  a quarter inch and then i take her then i take her ankles and arms and i move them back and forth  very quickly like a harmonica i play the pussy like a harmonica it only works like you're eating  corn on the cob that's why they don't call it a hemonica oh god oh chip jim yeah oh god uh i guess

[02:26:00]  a lot of mistakes when we're out on the prowl as they say and uh only you say that i say we say  yeah no you're right only i say out on the prowl i say out on the prowl who says that nobody says  that's film noir that sounds like real predatory oh he does yeah oh but he does a rapist  charles bronson  out on the prowl you're selling your wild oats oh please use a harmonica  hey lady you know when i could have used this back in uh when i was shooting i guess around 
[02:26:30]  the time i was shooting luckily which is 2006 i was out in la and i had a real big crush on this  girl and there was a guy named neil strauss who wrote a book called the game i read it and uh  it was a good book about meeting women and i wanted his help uh as to how to get this one  girl i wanted to hook up with i had no she was way hotter than me which most i always bat out of my  league but this one was like too far beyond for even a sense of humor to work so what is exactly 
[02:27:00]  that you do what do i like how do you help people yeah talk about the microphone neil strauss does but  i don't use uh pickup and lines and routines yeah manipulation and all of that you know what that  shit just never seems like it would really work i don't know it's been going great for me  amy buys all those dumb lines it does work there's there is a copy of the game is on here right now  there's there's a couple things that work because it fucks with self-esteem  and you're like uh you know you you'll talk to the her friend instead of talking to the one you want 
[02:27:30]  to talk to that fucks her up that's a thing that's not all dumb line the guy psychology the line you  know you have the whitest teeth i've ever come across see that would work on me that took me a  second to get there i went right there and i want you to meet my parents you're in love yeah i like it  lines don't work it's a whole attitude thing right yeah exactly what you were saying before 
[02:28:00]  it's all about feeding off insecurity that's so there's no success in what you're doing here i  had him on my show and he's not and he tries to come i thought he would be a guy's guy he tries to  make it about like hippie love and about fun it's like i thought he's gonna come on and be like yeah  you bang chicks and you know he was like no man it's just about love and finding the shut the fuck up  oh wow he wasn't a pig sorry yeah that's a different direction i actually am you're talking about neil  right yeah yeah i'm friends not neil not neil i had i'm sorry not him the guy mystery mystery ahead 
[02:28:30]  oh is that the direction that he's going in now that's completely the opposite because i met him  about five years ago at a david d'angelo seminar who's another pickup artist and um he pulled me  away got me on a couch for about two hours just talking on the couch oh i was gonna say  and yeah he was able to like keep me entertained for two hours but that's it it was being a good  talker yeah he was great he talked at me for two hours and i was competing with him trying to get  his attention and then afterwards i forgot about it was he peacocking he was totally peacocking he was 
[02:29:00]  wearing a spandex unitard big boa nail polish and a lunchbox i did that and i was accused of being a fat  superhero well you did fight crime you did fight crime but no you're right that it does it's like as much as  these guys are assholes sometimes it works it does and talking to the friend i'm always afraid if i hit on  her friend the girl won't be attracted to me and she'll be so grateful like oh thank god ugly is  talking to my friend and you give and then you kind of fuck with them you get you go oh you get 
[02:29:30]  something in your hair and you get it out yeah i got it and that that fucks with them like oh fuck i  had something on my hair the whole time and that breaks down their confidence i've done that before  but i always screw up well you got something to your shirt it's like oh it's a tumor  oh god damn shame jesus jimmy that's really unlucky jimmy that's a chicken cutlet because  my breast is gone oh god sorry there's two women in here i'm sorry that's all right mine are real i'm  not insulted there's three women oh i forgot lady came in okay yeah oh actually for sam sam's vagina 
[02:30:00]  of course you had to make it a cutlet a little woman so what you wrote a book or no no i haven't  written a book yet i am going to be writing a book article here in penthouse yes i'm the only  clothed person person in the magazine my mom is really proud but um i'm really proud of myself like  yeah it's a big thing to be in penthouse that is cool it's a great magazine i feel empowered i feel  sexy so yeah very proud of it that's cool are you married i am married now how did your husband get  you i asked him out did you really yeah i dated his best friend and then i dated his friend and 
[02:30:30]  then he i didn't work out with his friends i was like oh come to the beach and hang out maybe you'll  like some of my friends and so i met my husband there let's try to get rid of it by the way he's  like get rid of get over it bring your other friends i don't want you anymore um yeah i met my  husband on the beach there and you asked him out i asked him for his phone number and then we  started hanging out with each other quite aggressive that's cool i like that i'm with you marnie  you like it's always my idea yeah yeah you have to you have to ask for what you want for men and 
[02:31:00]  for women don't be afraid to ask for what you want you don't have to be a dick you don't have  to be manipulative or dishonest or most people are so afraid of the rejection you know they don't want  to get rejected if you go up to a girl that's out and uh you you ask her not let's go out but you  you kind of just yeah i would like to go out with her and she's just like no no and odds are she's  probably gonna say that yeah it's probably gonna say get away whatever you know something to the 
[02:31:30]  effect of no i'm not gonna go out with you no that's not true so it's better that you reject  yourself before she even gets a chance to reject you yeah really so you never get what you want  that's horrible oh no if bobby starts pressing fucking buttons i am gonna pull the plugs out  i told you and throw that machine i am gonna throw the machine i've never sat here before  there's buttons what do you do that's what i do too i start pressing on little buttons  there's little buttons here that do that you know boring oh what do you do 
[02:32:00]  i don't know how to say that that was a good rejection one though marnie have you ever met a  guy and you're like he has no chance like i there's nothing i can do to help you she's in  a room with six of them i was gonna say right now on that one she  i have met a couple of guys where i'm like it's not gonna happen mainly because they don't want it  to happen they fought me back on everything that i was saying didn't want the help that i was  providing so i fired them as a client and was like listen you're not gonna you have to give up 
[02:32:30]  this bullshit and they were like mail order yeah i see what they do so wait a minute oh so you  actually you charge to help like i'm i'm fucking i've gotten so jaded doing stand-up and radio it's  like i don't know how to approach a strange i literally have no idea how to approach a woman  who doesn't like know me from the radio ago i was a child so yeah you do it's approaching me  dude it's in a car at the meatpacking district you do fine with your roll down your window  i don't like the fact that bob made the roll down the window with his fucking hand the circle 
[02:33:00]  roll yeah i'm eating at the improv all the time i i think what you're talking about also is is  becoming like a lost art because of facebook and twitter and there's so many other ways to meet  people and get even intimate to up to a point without even having a you know face the rejection  face to face or or anything like that and then by the time you hook up you're all ready to fuck  because you've already gone through all the bullshit part right if if you meet anybody on the internet 
[02:33:30]  face to face and the preface to it hasn't been i want to fuck you i'm gonna suck your fucking  pussy i'm gonna you're an idiot yeah so by the time you do meet face to face you both know what  you're in store for everybody i know who comes over and there's not a woman that shows up at my  house that doesn't know that my dick will be out within 45 minutes your mom give me correction  within 15 minutes mom's very aggressive oh god so uh what were you saying oh what was i saying 
[02:34:00]  i was just saying that that's kind of a lost art so it totally is the thing is that not enough  people are asking for what they want and they're too afraid to look up while they're walking around  to work and actually interact with people start interacting with people at starbucks walking on  the street so that when a hot girl comes along you have no problem saying hey what's up because  she's just another person in your day rather than a freaking hot woman who you you know you're afraid of  being rejected do you think being married though that your technique or your skills or your knowledge  uh you know is is uh not as good as it was when you were single i would say maybe not as good but 
[02:34:30]  that's why i have about 10 to 15 other wing girls who can help me be single and give me that point of  view but i can still feel attraction i love going out and flirting i love feeling the build-up of  attraction when i'm with my clients and i feel feminine and flirty that's when i know that i'm doing a really  good job now how does that work with a client uh do they are you helping them with other girls at  a location or are you playing the part of the other girl everything i do i do a lot of skype coaching 
[02:35:00]  calls not a lot of in person so skype yes skype i skype my guys you're walking into a terrible world  right now seriously it's like you skype me off yeah um you notice that they're only shooting  themselves from the chest or neck up what's wrong you're on there's all this painting and i don't  understand what's going on i'm washing the dishes whatever i'm getting my money don't mind me  just a little face cloth thrown over his shoulder yeah but i work with men all over the world like  egypt spain uh australia canada south america what do you tell guys from egypt like walk up and go 
[02:35:30]  hey i like clit and that'll get you right over there they cut them off of course they don't  they take them away but yeah i do i work with them in person as well mainly what i'm doing is  i'm offering men a female perspective that's what the wing girl method is i have a blog i have tons  of free content on there giving men the information straight okay here's the basic gist of what guys  need to know maybe you could give a little quickie on this one uh you're you're you're out in some 
[02:36:00]  type of atmosphere it could be a party it could be out at a bar uh awake perhaps a good place to  meet women always oncology uh ward vd clinic abortion clinic yeah you're at a flash mob you're in a  supermarket you see a woman being bludgeoned by eight people who are stealing bonbons i love that  places to meet women yes you're at a well more conventional place that most people do meet 
[02:36:30]  a party a bar library right right jim say all the places he's not allowed yes now a preschool  a library and a preschool yes what can a guy do that is really like the most important thing  that that could get his foot in the door can you say hi i mean vagina i mean  she's gonna coach you to hit on me oh goody let's do it let's do it all right so let's see 
[02:37:00]  your approach don't mention the fact fuck me amen yeah okay listen hey i'd like to i'd like to rip  that country croc dress off you put the gun down anthony  you've been sitting on that jimmy's like sitting over there i'd like to dine on her tablecloth  hey miss miss engels can i take you out here we go these are things that wouldn't work these are  this is an example of not making fun of her clothes probably with that outfit you know what the fact 
[02:37:30]  that you're saying everything with confidence and you're doing it with some sense of humor  actually would work but then i would have to walk around with this microphone attached to my head  because the second this goes away so if you grabbed her if you grabbed her by the front of  the hair and pulled it back like a wig and said hey come here i want to talk to you  that would work backwards because it might be a real way  no i want to know what is something that could be done that that you're very unfamiliar with  is this a bad line i've tried this in clubs if you ask for something like i'll walk up to a 
[02:38:00]  girl do you know where the bathroom is because i have to shit  i want to go home with you i would absolutely go home with you  there are certain girls i would as well i love that i love that stuff i love when guys just  say it straight i love to see that because that might work  you know what the bathroom is  the whole reason why that would work is because you don't give a shit you're living your life  you're asking well you are trying to give a shit but it's an you know but it's like you're just 
[02:38:30]  living your life and not really caring the minute that you put focus onto it and you're not really  clear with your intentions or state your intentions that's when you get fucked up so you can say hi  you can make an observation you can ask a question as long as it's genuine and authentic  that would be authentic  so jim genuinely needs to drop a tweet  if you didn't then that would be inauthentic and that would not work  she'd laugh and be like you know that's pretty funny and he'd go no really i gotta shit  honestly see you later i gotta go i need to punish a bowl  have you ever had some girls might be pissed some girls would love it have you ever had a guy that 
[02:39:00]  you just said i can't you are too much of a just a nerd or piece i just asked that bobby did you  hear what i just said i don't like it when you listen bob i don't listen to women yeah i don't hear  you i was just looking at your tits thank you and i don't care about the question i'm just looking  answer go thank you no aren't they great aren't they just sweethearts yes you're wonderful men  i thought two of child molesters  the worst group of people you could be in with right now 
[02:39:30]  i've been up since 5 30 in the morning it's wonderful  well i guess you guys went up earlier so that doesn't mean anything  actually no no we don't prepare for this  how would you help how would you help someone because literally my game sucks  i stand up and all this these are built-in things that help you  but on my own left to my own devices if she's not familiar with me live game  don't know the girl have to go up cold what's what's i'm never gonna do you have to take 10  steps back first and start approaching people in general i know you're like great not a magic 
[02:40:00]  bullet how metaphorically it sucks um no but really like take this take this 10 steps back and  you gotta start liking yourself first before any woman's ever going to like you exactly you're  like we all hate ourselves time of jerking off i don't have a problem with fucking picking i'm a  vampire when they're picking up chicks no i would think you would i fucking when i when i used to  pick up chicks before i was married i used to bang i used to pick up chicks all the fucking times  it was actually very good because he was a good looking guy all right well you still are not smoking 
[02:40:30]  hot chicks you know from from fives to eight bobby would pick up fucking really hot women like  bobby new york yeah yeah new york oh yeah some hot because but i had comedy too which is for the  last 20 years which always helped me but even before comedy like aa meetings you get them when  they're still shaking but but you're really comfortable with who you are you can tell that  you are but no your perception is wrong yeah he hates himself so much yes that he's kind of come  through the other side full circle and appears comfortable yes it's the black hole fucking shit 
[02:41:00]  yes you surrender to your hatred this is what you get if someone could blow their head off with a  shotgun and then still talk this is what you have that's it i know why does that make sense  comedians or psychologists or whatever it is they rely on their expertise to get them to their  comfort level so that's where they usually go first but then that sometimes gets them into the  friend zone where they are the entertainer or they are the psychologist or girls that they're  interacting with and can't transfer it back to a sexual thing that is the dangerous part especially 
[02:41:30]  with the more the girl that is more uh shallow and likes just the good well the good looking  likes the good looking guys and then you're funny and entertaining and you end up being a friend  and get the pleasure of watching her fucking you know some dolt see i don't care i don't need a guy  to be like really good looking as long as he's rich right yeah cash is definitely that's a lot  cash and power that's how that's how it is so if you can get that that you'll win that's kept me 
[02:42:00]  that's kept me and girls for a good 10 years now i just do it more directly i don't there's no  faking it it's like here's your here oh here's your money yeah yeah okay get me a towel from the  bathroom i'll go to the door well the difference is between establishing yourself as a friend and  and like funny man is incorporating some sort of touch and also respecting yourself so you're not  there to entertain the woman you can engage and disengage at any time that you want sometimes  you'd be surprised though like being the friend and i i hate guy friends because they're all  cock blockers there are times where it's worked because uh i fucking grow on you that's that's 
[02:42:30]  like that's my thing like i women don't look at me and just go i want to fuck him never does that  happen it's never that reaction i don't yeah there's something it's like when you lock into  somebody's personality and you start to really know what makes them tick and you kind of know  how to fucking to kind of sneak around the back door described a serial killer become yourself  in front of them is that what you're saying no but when you figure out like if you're trying to  fuck somebody when you figure out exactly how to fuck them and everyone's got a way there are  people who are in relationships or married that you can't have but most people unless you look like 
[02:43:00]  a burn victim if you know how to work them you can't eventually fuck them i mean that really is  the way i think so too i'll fuck a burn victim again we've lost you for a second sorry  but i'm saying sometimes being a friend helps but some of the smooth fingers  being a friend you're saying listening having conversations connecting with somebody talking to  somebody there's women i know who are in relationships i'm friends with which is but  there's people i've talked to who are in relationships and uh i've stayed friends with them and uh one girl 
[02:43:30]  i was friends with for three years before we ever dated like that will happen once in a while too  and i've noticed that most of the women that i've been platonic with that i wanted something more  with eventually it's happened not always but the majority of times when exactly what you just said  you wanted something platonic with them you weren't no no no i'm sorry i wanted something  more with yeah that i've been platonic one girl i was one of my best friends but i was in love with  her really yeah and so what what changed what was the snap i i told her i wanted to go out with her 
[02:44:00]  and uh she said no i emailed her because i felt it was courteous to not to not uh speak straight to  her face just it wasn't a fear thing it was i wanted her to be comfortable with her i didn't want her  to have to fake her response out of courtesy i wanted to give her her own time to read the email  and process it not pack her bags move out of the country exactly change her email address  her number yes download the attachment i sent for enhanced jingles um but she's like no because  she knew too much about me and she's like i'm sorry i can't do it so for a year we uh i kind of 
[02:44:30]  just didn't talk to her for six months and then uh then we started dating no but that's a good thing  you separate it there's a lot of guys who say i really want to be with you i love you or whatever  it is that they're saying they're they're expressing that they don't want to be friends  and the girl's like no i don't see you that way you're like a really good friend don't want to  ruin our friendship and then they stay in the friendship but like actually enhance it so they  hang out with them more they give them more they pounce on them more so that's completely  unattractive you did the respectful thing and said i want to be more with you if i can't have it i'm  separating that's how you get out of the friend zone oh you know what that's actually a good point 
[02:45:00]  because i would this is again when i was away in la uh for a while and then and then she's like  when did you come back from la and i was like about six months ago yeah  no but that's the whole thing is because not it's not because you've taken away the attention  but it is partially because you've taken away the attention and you've taken away the neediness of  needing to be with her where she finally can see you as being an attractive option as soon as you  stop giving a fuck about her she starts giving a fuck about you that's true saying that treating a  girl like shit is the way to get her and that's always been the 
[02:45:30]  no she's saying ignore her not treat her like shit ignore her  ignore her exactly  it's not about that it's about respecting yourself first you're not getting what you want you gotta walk away and separate  you have to be careful though because you can develop a hatred towards women  right when you start fucking around with this psychology shit where you start manipulating  and getting  that's what the pua stuff is it's like referring to it as tactics and routines it's when you start  thinking about it that way that's when it becomes negative and actually really hurtful because it 
[02:46:00]  fucks around with you and it fucks around with women and ruins your chances in the long one long run  um yeah yeah  well i guess so yeah  no it's true  can you do a scene with i mean can you teach him something right now with amy can you do a  i read in the article you actually do uh you do mock pickups  yeah no i definitely i would love to get picked up it's i'm like you like it's always like my idea  i'm like we're gonna go out and the guy's like no and i'm like yeah you're like yeah you're going  out we're going out okay so you're gonna go up to amy and you're gonna squeeze her boobs  you can squeeze mine 
[02:46:30]  so let's see it i want to see a pickup uh uh i'm really bad at it do you listen to opie and anthony  see there you go uh no i don't well then you won't fuck me  try just say try saying like hey how you doing my name is jim  thanks bob oh look you're gonna be a coach for me it's wonderful  try it no you just say hey what's up hey how are you  good good cool and then i'm just thinking all i'm thinking after the hey what's up 
[02:47:00]  and then walk away and she says uh yeah uh not that all i'm thinking is in her head she's  just thinking i'll shut the fuck up listen she's not going to carry on the conversation if  you're not approaching her with something or with purpose then what's the point of her  talking to you what do you is this your first time here uh no i ride the subway all the time  oh okay because a lot of times i'm here earlier where there's a lot better asses to press up  against oh god see i like that i like that i love that observation and sharing even though okay then  you would have continued after that to like make a more serious statement but i like that you're 
[02:47:30]  just i think it was good too i just think you should blink more wait you're on  more blinking more twitching i blink and twitch a lot when i'm talking to a girl  yeah that's good so uh okay so we're on the subway together yeah do you have a cell phone camera  yeah i won't jerk off in front of you  oh my god no matter where you are make it sound like that's the place to be  hey isn't this great exactly it's so exciting on the subway  i am so fucking badass kiss me you're not that bad you actually are pretty good 
[02:48:00]  no because my sense of humor is very barbaric and i go to things like that like that's really  like things i want to say okay you got to say the things that you want to say it's as if you have  Tourette's sorry to insult anybody who has Tourette's but like literally say the things out loud  that you want to say so you're not keeping them inside your head  but then show the sincere side of me that you just showed two minutes ago  that was super sexy and attractive if you have a balance between those two  this is why she's get very good attention here's why fucking marnie is great  because what i just did marnie is great 
[02:48:30]  you know what that was one of those little language things that the pickup artist talk about  wasn't intended now nlp you're using it on me um no but this is why marnie is very good  because what i just did was basically repulsive with amy but she has a great way of taking the  repulsive and going hey you know and basically work with it she found the silver lining to your  adoption you found not even a diamond in shit you found a nugget of corn i want to give myself a  diamond corn's great yeah it's delicious it's great but no you're right because it's like when you 
[02:49:00]  start seeing someone you meet them you're you're being like a fake version of yourself usually so  better to come out you know come out swinging let jimmy let me know right away i'm a pervert i'm into  sodomizing children like i knew right away i didn't say children i didn't say i would i would  only say that during sex it would come out i would say call me pop pop instead of daddy  i don't want you to scream i want you to go google gaga i just did a boot camp in toronto and it's  all based on observation like you teach people how to walk around and really just have conversation 
[02:49:30]  by breaking in with observation and then going into sharing where you're sharing something about  yourself to connect to the other person because if you go in approaching with your penis  she's not going to respond so you have to put an observation like uh all right um hey how are you  good good you know the jews control the banks  i'm jewish and i appreciate that observation there you go observation  quite an observation oh my god this guy really knows his stuff do you want to go see my place 
[02:50:00]  no i love it that i know you're saying it's easier for a girl there's it's not easier for  well it's gotta be okay yeah it's gotta be easier for a girl the way i got on this show i actually did  i met anthony on the subway and i went up to him yes and i he was with a girl but i just went up and i  said hey i i have a wet hole too and that was it and i was like you know what sold you gotta come  on the show he said you've got a face for radio and here i am but then he heard i said i heard it 
[02:50:30]  wasn't wet i heard it felt like an inner ear it's like a nostril it's just sticky  no you're right it's not it's not easier for a girl i i also need to use it's really hard especially  because you know these guys have a good level of fame it's easy for them to just people come in  already like loving them right so to be just a dude at a bar it's like fuck it why would you know  it's too hard to go back to the drawing board it feels like it's hard for women to be aggressive too 
[02:51:00]  because if you're a comic and then you want to fuck a dude or you come off that that could weird a guy  out like what does this chick's you know what does she got about yourself what aids does she have you  know herpes you know i always get flipped out at aggressive sexually aggressive chicks flip me out  like what what do you think about diseases before you come what's wrong with you wow this is my method  as i'm wiping my dick off with a sock i'm like you've been tested right i have my diseases circle i have 
[02:51:30]  my diseases circled on my cock where i got them originally here you got them with a mask yeah  the warts over here he's got to pull pins out of his dick like fucking uh like mask what was that  movie mask yeah you got it you nailed it you got it i'm not bobby i'm not sexually aggressive like i  was with this dude about a month ago and we did not have sex because we didn't have a condom and he  said no so i was like listen everybody is hpv like i just let him know that we all have it so and  he's probably just a carrier by the way the best can i point out the best part of amy's bomb 
[02:52:00]  is the way she's trying to make it into a serious thing  you guys just stare at me like feel it bitch  enjoy it really it was funny to watch her turn that into a serious thing  condom and he said no but you know condoms are important  you know people i wasn't trying to make it serious  hpv that's the one where the the uh your pussy cervical cancer hewlett-packard 
[02:52:30]  oh no i'm thinking of something else what's the one where it makes you your pussy look  look like someone who's uh talking but they have dry mouth they have the white stuff in the corner  of their mouth that's probably a yeast infection  probably a yeast infection yeah it looks like your pussy is manic depressive  yeah it's on prozac  hey look your sleepy eye vagina did your pussy just wake up oh my god  pussy is eating its curds and whey  marnie what can you do for these guys i don't know i'm enjoying all of them 
[02:53:00]  oh god i think it's great  it's horrible  the wing girl method cannot do much for the men in these rooms  that's true  that's why you suck at that button  that's why i i that's why i was just asking like like the the cold walk-up seems impossible  it's not impossible as i was saying before with with baby steps or little steps if you do a cold  walk-up to people during the day then you can work yourself up to unattractive women 
[02:53:30]  most guys don't want to do a cold walk-up to just the fucking you know somebody just sitting there  smoking a cigarette somewhere in their booties when they have to go approach a really hot girl  do you know how uncomfortable people i do that friendly bob shit in the elevator  i know friendly bob is the worst  what's that oh hello  i get a new elevator and i i i just go hey how are you i'm robert how are you  and it's like how are you  i'm good but that would freak me out  yeah i'm just being friendly  i know that you're doing it  but if you do if you walk up to a girl and go hey  i've actually 
[02:54:00]  i believe you have energy  i believe you have energy as well  and you can send my orange beam of energy to a woman  and make her make her do make her like me or make open up the channel  and i've done this  in a massage i kept my hand open  and i shot my orange beam of energy  to the masseuse  to hold my hand  and she actually  held my hand  yeah  from the celestine province  and then she massages  that's what she does  i like that you walk into an elevator and engage people 
[02:54:30]  but the the hey how are you is freaky to most people  but if you continued having conversation afterwards  and didn't get freaked out by them not responding  then you get the most attractive person in the elevator  my point about that is that people get so uncomfortable  when you actually say hi  and he does it to make people uncomfortable  wait do you live in new york  are you a new yorker  no  no okay  where are you from  i'm from toronto originally  oh i think it's different outside new york  like in new york if someone talks to you in an elevator  you're like  you get off to the next floor  but in other states i feel like people  just say how's your day going 
[02:55:00]  oh how are you doing  yeah  very good  oh that's wonderful  but i was in the elevator coming up to here  and i was like hey what's going on  and nobody said anything  i just go  these things plummet you know  and it really makes everyone nervous  how about a good laugh though  i'll say like the elevator's got  it's a good job  it's got some ups and downs  oh  oh  oh my gosh  fucking hate chip  yuck  if you continue past the hi how are you  and continue conversation  i do  then you're fine  then you're attractive and sexy 
[02:55:30]  but if you're just the guy who says  hey how are you  it scares people a little bit  it does  but then you can continue  and you're open  you're an open person  right  that's attractive  what is a girl thinking  in sweating over time  that's what she was thinking  she's taped  sorry  it's an assault joke  yeah of course  1500th one of the show  misogynistic slobs  for the most part  a guy approaches her  at a bar  or a social situation 
[02:56:00]  and  and  starts talking to her  before  she could even figure out  what he's  saying  what  what his intent is  what is she thinking  what is she thinking  when a guy's approaching  what is a girl thinking  when a guy just  isn't she just thinking  oh here's another guy  that wants to get laid  yeah  yes  initially yes  and then it shifts  all right  depending on what character  he presents to her  so if you start having  a real conversation  that isn't approaching  with your penis  then you might throw  her for a loop  and she starts thinking  do I like him  do I not like him  do I want to sleep with him  do I not want to sleep with him 
[02:56:30]  is he interesting  don't you think it's just  if you're attracted to him  it is if you're attracted to him  see and that's the difference though  with the girl  but if you're not instantly attracted  you are evaluating  because if a girl walks up  to a guy in that situation  and just starts talking  the guy's instantly thinking  god can I fuck her  exactly  because men are single focus  so women are multi focus  and they're multi scanners  so we're constantly  evaluating  and seeing whether or not  you fit into certain slots  for each of us  so it's  you're like  slots  let's fit into a slot  I like it 
[02:57:00]  you're not even listening  to me anymore  concentrating on my slot  but yeah  that's what we're doing  so when we're  like a lot of guys  think that women  are testing them  when we ask them questions  we're really just trying  to find out more information  about them  because if we do  let you fuck us  we can get pregnant  we can get diseases  we can get fucked over  like crazy  can I just stop  for one second  we have a caller  I'm just going to go  to the caller  I think we should  just take this call  hey what's up Al  how you doing  really  stupid callers 
[02:57:30]  hate the callers  turn the  stop the  okay  so uh  yeah  so where were we  slots  I've been single  for four months  and it's like  I have  honestly  I've not fucked anybody  it's like  it's brutal  have you been  trying to  no not really  audiences  your friends  your friends  family  constantly trying 
[02:58:00]  the government  yeah  I think a girl  knows like  pretty quickly  if she wants to  fuck a guy  yeah that's always  been the thing  it's like  how quick does a girl  know that  this is a thing  gonna happen  race has something  to do with it too  oh yeah  we have  Puerto Rican girls  black girls  they know  right off the bat  I'm gonna  I'm gonna fuck him  I'm fucking you  I had a  because white girls  you have to  kind of give them  the excuse  you have to kiss them  rub them  get them all horny  where they're like  I just can't  get up for work  in the morning  all right 
[02:58:30]  another racist joke  out  keep them going  racist dick  molestation  racist dick  molestation  rape rape  rape rape  rape joke  you can wear  a woman down  though  not always  but a lot of times  if you know her  they don't always  know if they  want to fuck you  like they might  know initially  but once you  figure out  I've had a lot  of women that  I think have  fucked me  just because they  know that they're  garbage deep down  like they know  that they're perverts  and they know  that it's okay  with me  and they're not  going to be  I've had women  you have to get  them too there  I think other  like Puerto Rican  girls or black 
[02:59:00]  girls that I've  been with  I had them go  relax  you don't have  to do all this  shit  I'm fucking you  tonight  let's just have  a good time  where I was like  wow  okay  but for them  Bobby you're a  racial difference  just like they  are for you  so maybe they're  not like that  with Puerto Rican  and black guys  maybe it's because  maybe the way  they are  hitting them  I don't have a  pit bull  white girls act  differently with  black guys  than they do  with white guys  that's basically  the same reason  well white girls  you have to give 
[02:59:30]  there's so much  to you have to  take them out  talk to them  listen to their  fucking  buy them a hat  buy them a hat  yeah buy them a jam  or toast  a jam or a toast  you are quite the guy  I would love to go  on a date with you  Anthony has to put  popsicle juice  around their lips  so he can get a heart on  get a little younger  why don't you  turn it off  I think for a lot  of white girls as well  they still don't want 
[03:00:00]  they don't want to  think of themselves  in a certain way  so if they're like  I'm just going to  fuck this guy  then I might be  a slut or a whore  right you have to  give them the excuse  you have to get them  to the point where  you talk to them  blah blah  and it escalates  and then to the point  where we all say  the same shit  it's like we don't  have to do whatever  you don't want to do  but we're sitting  there with our cocks out  trying to hypnotize  them with our dicks  you know  you don't have to  touch it  I don't want to say  Anthony likes young girls  but the last girl  who sucked his dick  had the morning  after peeling her breath  you can't get much 
[03:00:30]  younger than that  what a zygote  crawling up my dick hole  do you guys  experience the same thing  like women of  different races  do you see a different  reaction to you  Anthony's racist  because I think  Anthony's never  you have a different  demeanor  you hear yourself  way differently  than the two of you  well Anthony's never  been with a black chick  his dick wears a hood  I'm a white  his dick is called  the grand wizard  yes I'm just saying 
[03:01:00]  I don't know  it's just who you are  I think you're the  exception Jimmy  I've never been  I always know  pretty much right away  if I want to have  sex with a guy or not  but is it do you  want to have sex  with him or do you  want to date him  or do you want to be  is it just like that  I'm interested in you  and I'm attracted  or is it I want to  fuck you right now  no it's not I want  to fuck you right now  but it's like just  something I know if I  want to fuck that guy  right then right away  and then you know  I've had sex with my  last two boyfriends 
[03:01:30]  we had sex like  immediately and then  it wound up turning  into a relationship  but that wasn't my  intention  but you feel it in your  belly right  you can feel it  it was actually my  clit  but Amy's pussy  is magic  she has a magic pussy  magic  no but I thought  oh we're just gonna  we're just gonna have  sex a couple times  and then it turned  into a relationship  I don't know  but I feel like  I know right away  but didn't you ever  have somebody  do something  that all of a sudden  the click happened  like for men 
[03:02:00]  it's more visual  like a girl  who you just think  is a regular girl  and you're not  attracted to her  will wear something  that shows her nipples  but literally  or she'll say something  that I can lock into  sexually  and then I wanna fuck  like a lot of times  it does not happen  right away at all  not that I remember  if anything the other way  like I  you know Kurt Metzger  yes  has he been on here  no  oh yeah  okay so Kurt  we like years ago  started dating  like we never  hooked up or anything  but then I realized 
[03:02:30]  you're like  Muppet eyebrows  I realized  you were really  into facial expressions  I don't know  he decided  he decided  like that  that he thought  he didn't even  really know me  but he was like  she's like the one  and I was like  and then I realized  I was gonna hook up  with him  and then he said  something  it was probably  about like fucking  prostitutes  or doing coke  or something  but no  but he  I was like  I realized  he looks exactly  like my father  oh shit  and my dad is MS  he's in a wheelchair  and I was like  Kurt we're not gonna  be able to  and I showed him 
[03:03:00]  a picture of my dad  like to get out  of fucking someone  by literally showing  and he was like  this is why  I can't do it  he understood  he was like  oh yeah  I do look exactly  like your dad  I had girls  that like  reminded me of my sister  and I was like  I gotta go  really  and how she kissed  because he had to go  jerk off  she reminded me  the same way  they kissed the same  like her tongue  she kept her tongue hard  like a dick  and I had to suck it  no I'm joking  Bob why  I'm kidding  I just went too far  Jim I go too far  I feel like I know  right away  you don't think so 
[03:03:30]  have you like  over time  started to want to  have sex with somebody  for being attracted  to somebody  I know right away  for sex  I don't know  right away  but I know  when I feel  that I'm attracted  to them  I know  when I'm trying  to impress them  I can tell  when I'm nervous  I can tell  when I'm uncomfortable  I can tell  when I want them  to like me  does this  fuck with your marriage  at all  I mean  does your husband  get pissed  that you do this  at all  at first  yes  I met him  a month before  I started my company  and I went to  I went to  like a Jewish  singles mixer  and  really 
[03:04:00]  why don't you  just fucking  meet somebody  on the street  with your techniques  what was it called  Complain Fest  USA  I just started  dating Jordan  my husband  who is the best  man in the entire  world  and  why are you  doing this  this is cold  my back hurts  I'm hungry  it's too hot  in here  it's too cold  there's like an  award ceremony  I guess  no  I'll reward you  it's fantastic  she got the shit  down  yeah  I feel like I've been here before  hold on  the trophies 
[03:04:30]  are going to be given out  most improved  you met your husband  at a mixer  no I didn't meet my husband  at a mixer  I met him on the beach  and then a month later  because I was still open  to meeting other people  I went to a singles mixer  with my best friend  and nobody was talking  to each other  so I started grabbing guys  and making them go  talk to women  gave them instant feedback  telling them like  tucking your shirt  stand up straight  don't approach like this  don't hold your hands here  you're shaking  cut those curls off  yeah exactly  cut the pants off  get rid of them  exactly  take that crucifix off 
[03:05:00]  and I put an ad on Craigslist  and 75 guys responded  by the next morning  and my husband was actually  away over the weekend  and he came back  I'm like I started a business  and he's like  what are you doing  and I told him  and he's like  Craigslist  yeah exactly  look at these pictures  he's like  you're an escort  I was like  no  you're an escort  I'm not  and then my parents  thought that too  they're like great  we send our little  Jewish daughter  off to LA at 23  and she's become an escort  in Los Angeles  that's awesome  and then after I got 
[03:05:30]  my first article  like in the LA Times  or something  they were like  oh you have a business  that's great  and then it started  molding and changing  and I started doing  more coaching with people  so I would help them  really grow  their self confidence  so that they can  attract themselves  and then attract other women  and then they became  very proud  because I started getting  emails from guys  saying  you're awesome  you changed my life  wonderful  so my husband's  really proud of what I do  but you're meeting guys  these single guys  all the time  and it would be hard for me  because I don't know  what type of person you are  but for me  I'm a weak  sexually weak deviant  I am not 
[03:06:00]  because you meet guys  because you meet guys  that are lonely  but they could be attractive  and there could be  an energy between you  because you're helping them  you're kind of  in with them  do you ever get attracted  to these guys  or have something  where it's like  this is getting a little  too fucking hairy  never  it's never like that  for some reason  never crossed the line  no I've never had that  I've had some of my  wing girls have that  and I love that  if that happens  and they make a connection  of some sort  do it off of my time  but absolutely amazing  I love that people  are your wing girls  pretty  oh my god  are they all 
[03:06:30]  penthouse girls  those girls are too hot  for me  penthouse girls  are they all  like penthouse type girls  or no  do you have like  an ugly intern  maybe  slightly quirky looking  you have one with an eye  that leaks  a weepy eye  a little furry as well  no I got one  one that made it  out of the fire  but not fast enough  you have one that  looks like him  just a little crispy  around the nose  where the whole back  of her fucking head  is burned off  so she  done  I'll put that out  on Craigslist  once I leave here 
[03:07:00]  so where are your  wing girls  how many wing girls  do you have  I have ten wing girls  and then I have  other girls  around the world  who work for me  and who contribute  with their research  and advice  and information  and then I've  interviewed  and researched  and talked to  like thousands  yes  I'm kidding  wait the wing girls  will go out  with you to a club  and watch what you're doing  or pretend to be  your girlfriend  not to pretend  to be your girlfriend  nobody ever pretends  anything  there's no lies  it's always that  they met here  for that night  and it's really  going out anywhere  it's not just about  going to clubs or bars  it's about going  anywhere  shopping malls 
[03:07:30]  will they sit with you  when I say pretend  to be your girlfriend  I mean like sit with you  if there's a girl  you like say  walk into a  walk into a place  with you  like you're together  okay so they pretend  for that  they're not making out  making out with you  in the corner  but there's usually  two wing girls  and one guy  so it's like  two girls  hanging out  with one guy  validating him  making him look  attractive  and then actually  pushing him  to go interact  with other people  you don't think  that's kind of  fraudulent though  for the girl  that is going  to meet him  you guys are  pretending that  this guy is something 
[03:08:00]  is it all going  to fall apart  you know what I mean  because he meets  you got two hot chicks  and this girl's  wow he's got  hot chicks  and her self esteem  gets a little fucked up  she wants a little  piece of that  they wind up  hooking up  and then you guys  leave and now  this fucking dummy  is just the creep  again  can they go back  to you  is that it  can the guys  go back to me  are you with them  through the whole  process of with  this girl  when they have  questions  when you know  she's taking her  clothes off  and he's panicking  because he came  already  right in the bed  exactly  they're coaching  him the whole way 
[03:08:30]  through  that's amazing  when a woman  sees you  it's almost like  when you're in  a relationship  women know it  because I guess  you're not hunting  as much  but women  if they see you  with hot women  they're much more  likely to want  to fuck you  because they see  other hot women  but these guys  who are going out  with the girls  have worked with me  first  they're wing girl  certified by that point  so they have done  a lot of coaching  with me  to be like  a freaking amazing  guy who can do  everything by himself  initially when I  started this  I would go pick up  women for them  and it felt weird  I was lying  there was like  50 year olds  who I was saying  I was their niece 
[03:09:00]  and that felt strange  and now it's not  like that anymore  what they do  is they take  my method  the wing girl method  and these girls  help them put it  to practice  out in the open  so you give the guy  the guy actually  if you're hanging  with two hot chicks  no matter who you  you're going to get  confidence  yeah and then  working with me  they're going to get  extreme confidence  on their own  so that they can  have these two girls  there who can help  assess  so by the time  they go out  yeah they're totally fine  it's not  it's not  it's not false  and that actually  was why I stopped  doing those outings  initially  because it seemed  escorty and false  and that wasn't 
[03:09:30]  what I was trying to do  so I went back  and I started making  programs  because I would be  with guys  and they would start  asking questions  I'd be like  damn you need a lot  of work first  before you can even  spend the amount  of money  are you helping guys  get  let me ask this  are you helping guys  get relationships  or pussy  whatever they want  yeah just options  get laid  options  as long as they're  still being honest  and non manipulative  like I don't want guys  to fuck girls  and screw them over  if they're going to be  dishonest and douchebags  I do not want to  work with them  but if they just want  to finally have options  in their life  where they can look  at girls and say 
[03:10:00]  yeah I want you  you you you and you  and I want to see  if I want anything more  from any of you  those are the guys  that I want to work with  and those are the guys  that I want to help  because every guy  is fantastic  but sadly for a lot  of women out there  the the only ones  who are being aggressive  and actually approaching  them are the douchebag  assholes  because those are the  ones who have  the extreme confidence  the really great guys  think that they can't  approach a woman  and ask her for what  they want  and they can't  they absolutely can't  what is the name  of your company  wing girl method  and uh how  obviously how much is it  how does it work 
[03:10:30]  it's different  there's a whole  there's like tons  of free content  on my blog  you can sign up  for my newsletter  you get even more  free content  and discounts  and then I have  instant download programs  you can do by yourself  I can do coaching  with you  do you have an app  where you are  I don't have an app  yet but I want  what you do  Jimmy does  oh yeah  wait so if a guy  do you do like  a one time consulting  thing with people  yep  how much does it cost  for a one time consulting  a one time consulting  is free  oh okay  it's 15 minutes  with me and we talk  about what you possibly need  because some guys  may not need it  you can afford that  what kind of guys 
[03:11:00]  usually get in touch  with you  are they kind of  you know geeky  kind of  you know what  that's the main question  guys ask  they're like  what kind of losers  are coming to you  they're actually  amazing guys  they're wonderful  yeah I did a boot camp  in London  where we had 22 guys  we went around the room  and there was doctors  analysts  entrepreneurs  engineers  like great minds  that were in the room  all well dressed  there's not something  that they all have in common  that you see a pattern  yes I'm going to pattern  like ah  it's called baldness 
[03:11:30]  it's called england  it's just fucked up teeth  immature  it's ejaculation  the guys that I work with  every girl who's listening  will understand  it's like  you always have  this one friend  or even like guys  you always have  this one friend  who you're like  why aren't you  with anybody  like why can't  you find anybody  my friend teddy b  was like that  in florida  monday  it smells bad  did someone fart  I did  way over here  you're the worst man  oh fuck  it's really bad  it's strong  wow 
[03:12:00]  see that's  so now we're on the train  I just did that  hey how are you  no we hate you  that was me  we hate you  that was me  that was me  that was horrible  I would have sex with you  right then and there  see that's a guy  I could throw up  with the song  actually something  just popped in my ass  that's not a fart  I feel like I could cry  right now  I'm gonna start crying  that smells like  spoiled meat  yeah it's spoiled meat  it's something I ate  a week ago  there are girls  in here today  dude I need  fucking horrible 
[03:12:30]  Amy's leaving  she's leaving  the premises  can I just tell you  how small it was  it was this little  I didn't think  it would affect the world  it was like this  this is how  that was it  I have something  wrong with me  I told you  there's something wrong  I'm shitting like  ribbon candy  what  I don't know  what is it coming out  like  it's not coming out  like a nice  it's coming  ribbon candy  oh like when it goes  it's when you  cheese candy  get it you ribbon 
[03:13:00]  my fucking mouth  should have fallen off  are you okay Amy  I feel  that was bad  I feel like I'm never  going to trust  Bobby again  so this is going  too hard  that's the step  that it takes  her hair is curly  my hair frizzed up  like an egg  McMuffin that just  came out of your  taint  that was awful  that was really  awful  so now how can  people get your 
[03:13:30]  services  I can go to my  website  winggirlmethod.com  and again there's  tons of free content  on there for information  sign up for my  newsletter  and anybody who  mentions this show  gets a 25% discount  are you going to get  your own TV show  is that in the works  so because you have  the other show  the millionaire  whatever it is  I've met with a lot  of producers  and I've gone around  to networks before  I actually went around  with Jennifer Love Hewitt  last year as the  producer to pitch me  so I thought I had  a good chance of 
[03:14:00]  getting a TV show  what did you say  she has cankles  that's not really the  point we're trying to  is she really  yeah  who cares about her  cankles  she's gorgeous  somebody bummed me  out about it  I think Dane told  me one day  he knew her  Dane  no no no  McCarthy  my friend from  high school  he told me that  and it ruined it  every time  she has a beautiful  body  she's beautiful  but if you  look at the photos  very nice  that wasn't even 
[03:14:30]  the point  so it's over  it does ruin it  it might spoil things  because that show  she has her own  technique  but I don't agree  with her fucking  technique  no neither do I  it's weird  many people  have the exact  same thing  they're like  you're not  fucked up enough  for television  which is a compliment  to me  but I want a TV show  so  yeah but the guys  you get are  fucked up  right exactly  she gets millionaire  guys who don't  need her  if you're a millionaire  I don't give a fuck  no but if you're a  millionaire you  actually need me  probably to work  with you and whip  you into shape  so that you stop 
[03:15:00]  being a douchebag  and flaunting your  money because you're  never going to get  a quality woman  if the only thing  you have to rely on  is your  quality  yeah exactly  who needs quality  who needs quality  in your breasts  that's all I want  I need a backpack  and a lollipop  get over here  I want a fucking  pleasant gimp  I know  what a personality  she has  because she had  to develop it  oh my god  yeah  girls that don't  need any personality  after I'm done  working with men  I'm going to start  working with women  as well  and just relay the  information that I've  learned from men  and tell them 
[03:15:30]  because there's  women are not  taking enough charge  either like as  an assignment to  anybody who's  listening I want  you to go up to  three people that  you find attractive  and say hi  number one  and then say I  find you really  attractive let's go  for coffee  that's the assignment  right there  and in this you  give up no fail  pickup tips to  guys in the  penthouse issue  what's one of the  no fail pickup tips  I don't know what's  in there I've given  so many tips  tips from a pro  wait wait no fail  one thing I will  tell you it's not  about what you say  it's about how you  say it I can have  ten guys lined up 
[03:16:00]  in front of me  saying the exact same  line and I'm  gonna have a  different feeling  from each of  them it says play  the odds  yeah that means  hit on a lot of  people yeah it  means put yourself  out there  yeah hit on a lot  of people  exactly how you  say something  how you say  something's important  right yeah  how you say  something's important  like if you say  if you say hey  how you doing  that's cool but  if you go hi  hello  and blink a  million times  and like really  close in front of  her face and  grabbing her boobs  that probably won't  work how about if  you go hey how  you doing 
[03:16:30]  oh no  that's a good one  yeah that'll have  them just fucking  wet  yeah  what happens if  you're an Indian  you go how  are you doing  how many of you  going to the bathroom  and you go you want  to come with  don't do that  like David Mamet  no  all right  so what's a tip  what's a tip  give us a tip  one of the tips  out of the magazine  do you want the  magazine  I don't know if  you know  I can give you  a few tips  the biggest mistake  that people make  people in general 
[03:17:00]  but men  is not approaching  you reject yourself  before giving a woman  a chance  another mistake  is I hate  when people say  that women don't  want to be with  a nice guy  women absolutely  want to be with  a nice guy  they just don't  want to be with  a wimp  someone who  gives up his  needs and his  self-respect  to smack him  right off the bat  so they want to  be with a nice guy  who actually has  a backbone  my husband  happens to be  one of the nicest  guys I've ever met  but he states  his expectations  he has boundaries  he respects himself  and he respects  his time  he'll make you  flinch if you  don't have dinner  on the table  exactly  I like a nice guy 
[03:17:30]  in life  I like a guy  who's nice in life  but in the bedroom  he's a little bit  of a degenerate  like he's a little bit  is that you  I was gonna say  you're very aggressive  and I don't mean  controlling in a bad way  you can control  a situation  but in bed  I bet you're like  you like when your  husband takes the reins  I want to feel feminine  when I'm feeling  my most feminine  that's when I'm  the most turned on  when he's like  choking you  and slapping me  across the face  I love it  I'm the same way though  in life I'm controlling  but I like to 
[03:18:00]  I want to feel like  a dainty little woman  I'll give a girl  a noogie  when she's about to come  I would probably like that  no but for women  especially women  of New York  who are a little bit  more aggressive  and take charge  yeah you do  it takes a lot more  for us to feel feminine  so don't hold the ipad  over your wife's face  when you're having sex  right  with your picture  of yourself on it  well hopefully  that helps some people

[03:23:30]  I was  I participated  I should say  in a wrestling  show over the  weekend  how'd you do  well I  managed  the new  tag team  champions  of the  world  did you  interfere  well I  mean I  got up on  the apron  once  sure  but I  had to  make sure  my guys  were being  properly  represented  gotcha  you know  what I  mean  what would  you  what would  you  compare  your  man  since  Ant  said  all we  do  is  talk  wrestling  I'm  going to  do  this  sure  what would  you compare  your  managing  styles  to  would  you  be  like  a  Bobby  Heenan  Jimmy  Hart  it's  a great  question 
[03:24:00]  Eric  Nagle  Oliver  Humperdinck  I was  that's a  good  reference  I was  given  of course  the manager  of the  beast  of the  east  Bam Bam  Bigelow  I was  I was  given  quite a  compliment  back  in the  in the  locker room  area  of this  show  one of  the guys  came up  to me  who was  like  I think  a wrestling  student  he did  one of  the  pre-show  matches  he was  just like  a skinny  guy  but  he was  a fan  he was  a good  guy  and  he said  let me  tell you  something  dude  I saw  you out  there  and it 
[03:24:30]  so you  know  he was  successful  he had  Sid Justice  what did  Harvey walk  out with  I want to  say the  covered  tennis racket  but that  was Jim  Cornette  he was  Dr. Harvey  Whippleman  so he had  a stethoscope  and a doctor's  bag  but he had  something else  didn't he  no  how much  stuff could  he possibly  have with  him  he wore  the  Peewee Herman  suit  like with  the bow tie  yeah but he  had a stethoscope  and a doctor's  bag  how much  stuff could  he possibly  carry to  the ring  I don't  know  I also  I mean  are there  any girls  around  I saw 
[03:25:00]  Nicole  walking  around  a minute  ago  from the  morning  mashup  I want  to ask  one of  these  girls  because  we just  had  what was  her name  Marnie  you know  Marnie  how do you  pronounce her  last name  Kinry  I don't  know  K-I-N-R-Y-S  Marnie from  Penthouse  she has an  article in  this month's  Penthouse  and she's  a wing  woman  so she  coaches  guys  on how  to get  girls  you probably  already knew  this because  we talked  to her for  an hour  ten minutes  ago  but  she said 
[03:25:30]  that  going up  to a  woman  and saying  hey  you know  where the  bathroom  is  I gotta  take a  shit  she said  that would  work  if you  said it  with confidence  alright  Roland says  that all  the time  and I  don't see  Roland  with anybody  he goes  home  lonely  every night  but I  mean  if you  see any  girls  you gotta  stop them  because we  have to  ask a  female  and I  mean  where's  your call  screener  isn't she  around  Monica  I don't  know where  she is  she picks  up odd  jobs  and she's  a bit  on track  but 
[03:26:00]  I mean  let me  tell you  Eric  you told  us  back in  the days  of the  sex bagel  you used  to sling  it around  quite a  bit  and by  it  I mean  that dick  of yours  you know  what I'm  saying  alright  if you  want to  put it  that way  what was  your  method  to pick  up  these  chicks  what did  you forget  it wasn't  like I  didn't have  any lines  or anything  it's just  I don't  know 
[03:26:30]  I just  talked to  them  you know  I'd find  out little  things  that they  liked  and then  it would  just harp  on those  little  things  all the  time  can we  talk to Julia  on the air  I'll find out  hang on  come in here  she's shaking her head  no get her in here  Eric  ASAP come in  come in here  come in here  she's saying one minute  now tell her to come in here  who does she work for  Eric's going to get her  I gotta find out who she works for  so I can properly introduce her  because I gotta get this question answered  and I have to ask a female  before we do some other stuff  like we said if you want to intern for the Opie and Anthony show and be part of all this magic that happens 
[03:27:00]  this is what happens when the show is not on the air  she'll be there in one second  everything is happening and you can intern for us at SiriusXM.com slash internships  that's how you apply and you click the little Opie and Anthony button  the Russian dolls are back  what are they doing back here  they were just in here  Boris and Anastasia just went into Shave 45  is Anastasia the older one?  she's the brunette that kept saying stay thirsty  oh okay  her  I don't know about her  Julia  go to the  yeah that mic's 
[03:27:30]  where do you work again  what  how do we introduce you  hello  yes you're on  is it on  I can't hear anything  well you're on  trust me  what a horrible producer  E-Rock  I have nothing to do with that  how come everybody who works here  thinks that you're horrible  Steve Sterniolo comes in here  I'm kidding E-Rock's great  well come on  you were being honest a minute ago  Steve Sterniolo comes in here  and he's harassing you  now Julia what do you do for Sirius XM  I work for Sirius XMU  Indie Rock Channel  oh that's the channel that Rob Cross works for 
[03:28:00]  yes  chill  down tempo electronic music  first wave  Troy you remember  what was it  because I don't remember  do you remember what Opie said  we should do with XMU  a couple weeks ago  he said to get rid of it  I can't remember exactly what he wanted in his place  I second Opie and Anthony Channel  yeah  because he said  um no  didn't he say XMU was college radio  yeah  huh  so  well welcome to the show  Julia  the question that we have  we're always the underdog  XMU  that's the way people like the underdog  that's why everybody loves E-Rock  because he's the 
[03:28:30]  he's the perpetual underdog  and everybody gets behind him  except for you  Julia the first thing she did  she walks in this room  her first words on the virus were  uh  E-Rock is a horrible producer  well I couldn't hear anything  he was like  go go  and I was like  am I on  what  yes  yes you're alive  now tell me this Julia  we had  we had a wing woman on here  a minute ago  who helps guys  get girls  helps guys say things  that will allow them  to pick up chicks  and she claimed  that if you go up to a woman  with 
[03:29:00]  as long as you do it with confidence  and you go  hey  do you know where the bathroom is  I gotta take a shit  really  she said that like  as long as  as long as you do it with confidence  it'll work  I don't know  you know  my go to  what I say  to my guy friends  is sometimes  I'll even purposely  spill something on them  and then I say  go to that group of girls  and be like  my friend just spilled stuff  all over me  do you have napkins  start talking that way  I wouldn't go to someone  and be like  oh I'm sorry 
[03:29:30]  go ahead  somebody watched me  chick flicks  that doesn't work  no that's not  no that's a much better  why don't I go  I pee my pants  yeah if you  if you pour it all over  their like  crotch area  and then you say  it looks like  I peed my pants  I'm so embarrassed  would you like to lick it off of me  no no no  that's what you say  would you please wipe  wipe this off for me  yeah would you help me  yeah  please wipe my pants out  what if somebody like Troy  came up to you in a club  Troy's tall dark and handsome  and he comes up  that's how I always describe it  if he is drunk  he is angry sometimes  sometimes angry  but he's not drunk yet 
[03:30:00]  because he's picking up girls  and he just walks up to you  and he says  excuse me  my name's Troy  do you know where the bathroom is  I have to take a shit  once he's done taking a shit  and he came back  does he have a shot  or are you just thinking  about him shitting  I'm gonna tell you  why that does work  it does  it does  okay  because if Julia's in the  in the bar or the club  and she's getting hit on all night  it's like hey  can I buy you a drink  hey you know  you look pretty  oh I like your dress  or whatever  and you do something  so far out of the  the realm of what's going on 
[03:30:30]  that night  you're gonna stand out  in her mind  and as long as you just  have a little bit of game  and know how to kick it  after that  you've already broken the ice  is that right Julia  I mean  or are you thinking to yourself  wait this is the guy  who took a shit  yeah  I don't know  I mean no one's approached  me with that line  I had a friend  we went to senior week  we would go down to like  Ocean City Maryland  for senior week  and my friend would walk up  to the hottest girl  he would see on the boardwalk  and he would go  he would just start talking  and he would just fart  really loud 
[03:31:00]  that's my move  and he'd be like  oh I'm sorry  I'm really nervous  that's funnier  than I think  and they'd be like  oh you fucking pig  and he would  sure enough  he would end up  hooking up with these girls  really  yes  wait so  do you think  that would work  on you Julia  if Troy came up to you  he's like  hey what's up  I'm Troy  lets out a giant gasser  and then says  I'm sorry  I get nervous  around pretty girls  well listen  would you be charmed  farting's always funny  what about  shitting's not as funny to me  because it's like  a physical product 
[03:31:30]  yeah because I'm like  ew  like you couldn't have  just taken a shit  before you went out  like really  or like  did you have to talk  to me about it before  yeah  like you couldn't have  just found the bathroom  guys fart  Rowan  I do both  you fart and shit  I do whatever it takes  do you  that's your line  you said  I used it many times  like hey what's your name  I go I can take a shit  I'll be back  does it work ever  no  no  I'm just like  you're probably gross  you probably didn't wipe  you're probably disgusting  gross  you're thinking about them shitting  or go come by your lemon 
[03:32:00]  for your drink  to wipe my  clean my hands  a little bit better  because the smell is still there  yeah see that  that doesn't  even Troy  even you would have to say  if you do  you can do stupid shit  I feel like you  and your friends  are the type of people  they're like 8 pack people  come on now  yeah first of all  they're like  they're all like  they're all in shape guys  and they all go  and talk to like  really dumb girls  and I feel like  that's how they end up  like  the girl thinks it's charming  that you just said  I have to take a shit  like that's a stupid person  I don't think so 
[03:32:30]  I mean I think  if you just  you own it  and you're just  you just say it with confidence  and you look like  you know  you're a cool dude  just hanging out  if a girl came up to me  and said  hey do you know  where the bathroom is  I have to take a shit  understand this women  that would be the end of it  like that's  that's because  in guys' minds  girls don't shit  and guys' minds  girls don't shit  I like to hear that Julia  yeah I don't  I like that  so if girls don't shit  why do women  that work a series  disappear for 20 minutes  from their desk  they're powdering their nose  yeah exactly  they're taking a big 
[03:33:00]  they're women  they have to powder their nose  they're ladies  for one  well  yeah but Troy  I do think that it's because  I'm not saying that  the women that you  and your friends get  aren't good looking  I think they're dumb  as a box of rocks though  yeah but you don't know that  I think though  I'm assuming  well yeah assuming  and any I think  you've met my ex-girlfriend  she wasn't dumb  yeah but I don't think  you picked her up by saying  hey what's up  I see you're a model  I just took a shit  well honestly  if you're going out to a bar  to meet girls anyway  I mean  it's not going to be 
[03:33:30]  a lasting relationship  I don't think  I mean that's not the best place  to meet  a long lasting relationship  at a bar  probably not  you know what I mean  like you're just there for  to fuck  you're just there for like  it's just a  you know  whatever  I never got the  what were some of the  I was trying to get a little  of the days when  sex bagel used to swing  that thing around  and by that thing  I mean his dick  yeah we got it  the second time I said it  you like that right  Roland  what were some of the lines 
[03:34:00]  that the sex man used to use  because Julia  I don't know if you know this  but the sex bagel told us  you know Eric  oh that's sex bagel  you didn't know that was his name  no I didn't know that  sexy B  got it  yeah the sex bagel  he said  because he used to go by the sex bagel  and he said in his sex bagel days  he used to  be with  bed  so many women  that it got to the point where  he was taking  his used condoms  out of the garbage can  tying them in a knot  and putting them in his pocket  to take them home 
[03:34:30]  because  his Nagel DNA  was that valuable  the Nagel seed  the seed  of Prince Nagel  I love how this story is involved  was of such value  to the ladies  of the United States  that he had to carry it with him  and they'd cut  he's afraid  that they were going to cut it open  and like a  like a  like a cookie batter  yeah  like you're squeezing out  the last little bit  like toothpaste  like a designer cake  yeah  like you ice  you know how when you're writing  on a cake and icing  you have the bag 
[03:35:00]  and you squeeze out  like they thought  they were just going to squeeze  a big N for Nagel  inside themselves  with Prince Nagel's seed  he thought it was that valuable  that he had to carry it with him  so what I'm asking  that's so gross  but that's all besides the point  what's wrong Roland  are you okay  he loves the idea of that  Prince Nagel  that's what he referred to himself as  I never said that  it's so valuable  this story  has grown so much 
[03:35:30]  from what it was originally talked about  it's such  it's a  valuable seed  it is  it's so much more valuable  than anything else  in that garbage can  right  you know what I mean  it's like  he throws it away  like common trash  but to that young lady  who's in the bed  that's as good as gold  she's never seen  such  such pristine  sperm  I mean  and she knows  the family he comes from  there's a lot of wealth  oh yeah  so it's like  she's taken care of  to her  each spermatozoa  is of such value 
[03:36:00]  that she can't possibly  let this go to waste  she needs to take it  and once Eric leaves  squeeze it inside of herself  so that she too  may one day  bear a Nagel  ew  well that's  that's what was going on  that's what was going on  in Eric's head  right  Prince Nagel  she wants  she wants her very own  Prince Nagel  to carry  in her womb  and one day  unleash on the world  where do you go from  shitting in the bathroom  to Prince Nagel 
[03:36:30]  Prince Nagel  that's the after show  that's after  Opie and Anthony live  what I was trying to get  that's all besides the point  though  what I was trying  that was just a back story  so you're more familiar  Julia  from XMU  what I was trying to get to  was  he didn't  Eric didn't really have  any pick up lines  or strategies  that he remembered  from the  Prince Nagel days  the sex bagel days  he calls them  do you remember  Troy seeing  the sex man in action  I do  the only time  I've seen him though 
[03:37:00]  in action was  with the band  that I was playing with  at that time  and he was there  hanging out  and you know  I mean at that point  you can just say  you're with the band  and like if you're in a band  it puts you in a whole  different world  so it's like what  Jim was talking about  where  for him  being comedy  and being a comedian  he has that  so it makes it easier  he said if you strip  that away from him  he doesn't have a lot  of game anymore  right  it's the same with a band  I mean if a girl  watches you play in a band  and there are people  there to see you  well we're talking about  Eric though 
[03:37:30]  did he play in the band  oh he was on stage  he was with the band  okay  so you know  they see you play  and then you just  afterward  you just  you have that  she's already seen you play  and people have  liked you  and people are kissing  your ass afterward  so it sort of makes you  attractive  so you don't have to tell her  you're taking a shit  you don't have to be  charming at all  you could be as disgusting  and as filthy as you want to be  and they just sit there  with a smile on their face  that's weird  I thought that's what  telling her you're taking a shit was  yeah  Eric  is that true  or is Troy short selling you  I was never filthy or disgusting 
[03:38:00]  I didn't say you were  oh okay  when you're in a band  you can be  I could not compete  to the level of  filth and being disgusting  because you're a prince  that  Troy and some of the other guys  could take it to  is that right  oh yeah  but  there were  there were a certain  like they had friends  that were  also hanging around  so when they would hook up  with Troy  and some of the other guys  their friends were around  doing nothing  and if you just talk to them 
[03:38:30]  when they're lonely  and desperate  then you know  you can really rack up  some numbers  it's like shooting fish  in a barrel  it wasn't a skill thing  Eric  it was like  I mean it was like  it's like girls  with low self esteem  at that time  that time  that time of my life  yes  it was just  right place  right time  but you did have the skill  before that  before and after  yeah  that's what I'm talking about  baby  that's true  that period was a little  different though  I've seen  I've seen the woman  that Eric is married to  way out of the way  women  I thought you said women  yes  you're a polygamous 
[03:39:00]  he's a Mormon  yeah he's a polygamous  no I saw  I've seen the woman  and had conversations  interacted  not in a sexual way  Eric  but interacted  with the woman  that Eric is married to  she's way over his head  yeah  so I would assume  that somewhere  buried deep down inside  there's a beast  there's a sexy beast  there's a real beast  yeah is that right Eric  I'll go with that  I love it  I love it  well Julia  I hope  that your  trip to after 
[03:39:30]  Opie and Anthony Live  has been  informative  educational  and  that you've learned  something new  about some of your  co-workers  yeah yeah  and you see Julia  at the bar  totally hip-ticking shit  exactly  because apparently  it works on anyone  no  we'll give out  your email in a second  yeah  don't  we will  and your phone number  that's okay right  are you on Twitter  Julia  you could plug your  Twitter  you can follow me  at Julia  Sirius XMU  you really didn't want  to for a second  that's a public  I don't know if I want  are you a jock on

[03:41:00]  get a time to  play it on the  live show  not that this  isn't live  but we didn't  get to play it  on Opie and  Anthony  so instead  we'll play it  on after  Opie and  Anthony live  into it  this is this  day in ONA  history for today  thank you Julia  the Opie and  Anthony show  presents  presents  this day  in ONA  our favorite  moments from  this very day  in Opie and  Anthony history  it was on this  day back in  2007  our inept intern  Craig got stuck  in the elevator  for the entire  show  are you really  in an elevator 
[03:41:30]  now I'm in the  elevator I'm  sitting on the  floor and I'm  playing with a  rubber band that  I broke five  minutes ago  he's already  losing it  Craig  why don't you  give out a  little distress  signal here  why don't you  give a big  help  yeah  say help  I'm stuck  in the elevator  hello  yeah hello  works pretty  good  hello  hello  no no  oh so  Hugh Junit  Hugh Junit 
[03:42:00]  is suggesting  you do a  rock scream  do a rock  scream from  the elevator  with the  little air  that's left  in the elevator  let's go  rock scream  Craig  this has been  this day  in O&A  in O&A  our favorite  moments from  this very day  in Opie and  Anthony history  we're back on  after Opie and 
[03:42:30]  Anthony live  that was such a  great day when  that happened  by the way  if you want to  hit on Julia  who we just  talked to  or just tell her  you're shitting  yeah she said  she wants to  hear everybody's  comments  she does  okay her  twitter name  is Julia  Sirius XMU  that's what it  is right  okay Julia  Sirius XMU  on twitter  and if you're  looking for a  date just let  the girl know  you're shitting  and so  she loves it  she loves it  but Troy that was  before you were  around that was  our intern Craig  who we all call  Craigie bra I'm  not sure why  but that was the 
[03:43:00]  day he got stuck  in the elevator  and I remember  sitting there  he was literally  in this elevator  on 57th street  for three hours  it was the middle  of the summer  and I remember  he got so hot  that he ended up  laying down in the  elevator with his  shirt off  and he was this  big fat kid  but do you remember  we were over at  K-Rock at the time  and he was over  at the old XM  building and he was  trying to  I don't know if he  was going back and  forth but that's  where he got stuck  early when we  started the show at 
[03:43:30]  K-Rock so he had to  sit there until we  came over at 9  it was like 6.15 in  the morning and I  remember I went over  with him and he  went up on the  elevator without me  and it got stuck so  I got to watch him  on the security cam  just watching him  for hours  she's like what the  fuck am I doing in  here I mean and  and it's that type of  thing that's like  life experience can  you imagine on  57th street and  Roland you remember  that building it was  an old building  yeah you I mean 
[03:44:00]  you have to get  the technicians  and I mean rats  running around the  Nazi guy in the  bottom floor that  checked you in  yeah they didn't  want to help you  the guy would never  help you  there wasn't a  staff there was  one guard there  and maybe one  tech who was there  sometimes and it  was in a really  old building so he  was literally stuck  in the elevator for  three hours I think  he had a bin or he  had some kind of  show stuff in there  with him and he  had to just lie down  I mean the thought  of being stuck in an  elevator for three  hours is terrifying 
[03:44:30]  I'd lose my shit  well over here  though you have  too many like  financial people  right they will  fix it in a  hurry  I mean I  like I always  thought when I  was a kid I was  afraid of getting  stuck on elevators  when I got a little  older I was like it's  no big deal then I  once got stuck in an  elevator for about  five minutes and  within two minutes the  walls start getting  close and you go I  gotta get out of  here I have to get  out of here because  you're not moving and  you start to realize  you're dangling in  midair in a tiny box  and nobody can help  I would try to climb  the fuck out 
[03:45:00]  is that what you  would do  I would lose my  mind I gotta get  out of there  my buddy got stuck  in an elevator he  told him they're the  pregnant woman in  there they try to  rush in but they're  just him  well we had security  cameras in here I  don't know what year  your buddy did that  but in the 80s  in the 80s before  they invented the  security camera but  yeah but it was a  beautiful thing just  to watch Craig Craig is  the same intern who  in order to celebrate  Halloween sat on the  couch at CBS and for  three hours hey candy  oh that's him 
[03:45:30]  sat there eating  pounds and pounds of  candy now is that  where Jay Moore jumped  out yeah I think I  think Craig is the  same intern yeah no  no no no it wasn't  Craig that was Bobby  the champ oh okay  Bobby the champ had a  nude Jay Moore jump  onto him but it was  Craig the intern who  who ate all the candy  he was stuck in an  elevator for three  hours and what I'm  trying to say is it's  like it's life  experiences like this  that shape you into 
[03:46:00]  the person you are  and that's what we do  here for interns at  the Opie and Anthony  show we shape them  into the future radio  professionals that they  can be you know what  I mean it's like half  the staff here were  interns I was an  intern and without that  internship and without  the help of Scorch in  Syracuse I could never  be shaped into the  professional that I am  today so if you want to  intern and if you want  some of these great  experiences that will  last a lifetime and 
[03:46:30]  let's be honest a foot  in the door of the  entertainment and radio  industry you just go to  SiriusXN.com slash  internships and you can  be under the tutelage of  the sex bagel the man in  charge Prince Nagel  himself you can be an  intern too people are not  writing flattering things to  Julia on Twitter are you  kidding me what are they  saying Eric I don't have  enough I don't want to  read that one read one  two read one or two I'll  read this one and her 
[03:47:00]  and her Twitter name by  the way we just talked to  her is uh Julia Sirius  XMU you can hear her if  you're into like uh she  said Twitter anything you  want whatever on your  money if you're into like  a college rock type stuff  bondage there's a lot of  don't say that wrong  there's a lot of variety  going on on XMU so you  can listen to her Sundays  from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. and  I'm sure she brings the  house down what are some  of the people saying to  her uh well one guy is  asking how she can  tolerate a little worm 
[03:47:30]  known as Sam Roberts  that's what I mean but  this one the first one  that reached out to her  uh said Julia I want to  put it in your butt  why would you say that  I don't know they're  they're abusing this  privilege she really is a  sweet gal she is she's  very nice obviously but  I guess you you fans  don't that doesn't matter  to you yeah yeah I get  twitters from them like  hey what's up fat fuck  have a great weekend  they're like oh thanks 
[03:48:00]  yeah well yeah like what  part of that did you mean  oh my favorite goes dude  you're so fat I um you  can't tie your shoes  dude uh can you help me  get this I'm like oh yeah  yeah yeah yeah like what  part of these tweets do  you guys mean do you mean  it when you tweet Roland and  say have a good weekend or  do you mean the other half  of the sentence when you  call him a fat fuck hey  you fat fuck have a good  weekend it's like Roland  doesn't know you so it's  not ball busting like do  you mean he's a fat fuck  or do you mean he should  have a great weekend I got  Twitter like saying um  you're an asshole not 
[03:48:30]  Colin Cain so I wrote back  fuck you and your family  well okay see that seems  like you're taking it to  the next level then they  get upset when Roland  blocks them yeah do you  block them a lot fuck  them all yeah I don't like  the ones who are mean  fuck them all I mean  they're just right  just kidding I would block  all the people who are  mean to me on Twitter  they have no I have no  followers left so I don't  have that option I want the  followers more than that  means more than you to you  then yeah then then some  ball busting the pain and  the agony that I go through  there are a lot of nice 
[03:49:00]  ones but just we get the  couple like there are I  don't I don't get them I  don't get them there's a lot  of them then like a couple  mean ones like hey you and  Uncle Nino should team up and  I go on the biggest loser you  fat fucks it's like what does  that help that hurts that  hurts why would you do that  to Roland Troy caught some  heat though because how  hostile you were to Eric the  other day yeah but you're  okay with that yeah that's  fine I mean look the one  thing did you put the video  up to show people how no  because I haven't gotten  Eric's alternative angle  to slice together crap I 
[03:49:30]  keep forgetting I'm sorry  it's okay don't worry  Troy's anger is out of  control well the one thing  that's just my opinion is  Troy is an honest guy and  hook or crook he's gonna  tell you what's on his  mind and that's what he  did it's what he continues  to do and don't let you  know some people not  liking what you're saying  change that about you  Troy Kwan no absolutely  not you wouldn't um  speaking of Julia and the  girls I can't forget yeah  Eric no I didn't know  you were gonna move on I  was gonna say we debuted  some new production from 
[03:50:00]  about Troy today too you  did yeah during one of the  breaks Troy the angry phone  screener do you want to  play it again sure all  right here it is this is  Troy the angry phone screener  I guess it's uh a new phone  promo yes yes okay hi  there this is Troy phone  screener for the Opie and  Anthony show here to help  you with a helpful tip when  calling into the radio show  it's a good idea that you  turn your radio down oh and  hey what's your name where you're  calling from yeah make sure to 
[03:50:30]  hope you know we don't know  shit from shit turn your radio  down what I can't hear you on  the air hey asshole am I live  right now hey turn your radio  down hey you turn your radio  down all right thanks man  punch it out see wasn't that  easy it gets you on the air  faster and it makes you a better  caller oh and if you want to  call the show just look down at  your radio yeah right there take  your eyes off the road and look  down see the number just call  eight six six wow one wow  that's eight six six nine six 
[03:51:00]  nine one nine six nine thank  you and have a nice day that is  very well done very well done and  uh and uh almost uh biographical  yeah I mean a lot of credit has  to go to D-boy he put that  together but the feeling behind it  are your true feelings now the  only thing I would have added is  at the end if I could like getting  the vibe of this and your  sentiment in it is mentioning  something about when you said  take your eyes off the road look  down at the radio maybe  mentioning something about hoping 
[03:51:30]  that they get into some kind of  car accident or no I don't want  them to get into an accident I  just want them to structure their  call well are they are you  telling me there's nobody that's  called up this show that you  would like to get into a car  accident no there yes there are  okay that's what I'm saying but  it's not a majority but it's a  very vocal minority yeah yeah so I  mean maybe throwing something like  that in like some kind of like  murderous sort of angle to it I  I don't know you know I'm not  behind this promo but yeah a little  history to Troy and I went to  Wendy's on Friday yeah number one 
[03:52:00]  and number two to try their new  buffalo dip sandwich what's the  buffalo dip first of all that's not  trivia that's just what you did for  lunch I mean it doesn't even  it doesn't even correlate to what we  were talking about but now that we've  moved on to sandwiches tell me  about this buffalo chicken we're the  first two people to order what is it  if they give the chicken sandwich I  dip in buffalo sauce and the woman  goes it doesn't exist then they  point out the big picture that's  behind her that sounds it was  brand new unbelievable do you  remember the little chicken tenders 
[03:52:30]  that they had that were buffalo  chicken and then they also the  barbecue buffalo wings yeah you  love those loved them well now they  have the sandwich I love hot sauce  dude it's awesome it's good it's not  as good as the osteago yeah it's  osteago whatever um but that's the  one I don't eat sauces just like hot  sauce wing sauce not Tabasco I can  handle Tabasco whatever hot sauce like  buffalo sauce and so that's that's a  sandwich I'll ask for mayo on the  side but it's just a crispy chicken  sandwich with a blue cheese oh we 
[03:53:00]  got it no blue cheese you just order  without it yeah I mean that's no  problem yeah and then Troy makes this  his sweet talk and he had more  chocolate yeah well we go down there  and we were really nice to the  Wendy's workers and this is one thing  about fast food because everybody just  treats them like shit yeah if you  actually treat them like a human  being and you keep going back they  will hook you up with shit  if you go caramel because of Troy  Troy goes it's a little more squeeze  like a squeeze squeeze but you go  beyond treating them like human  beings where Troy I mean let's be  honest because it's an honest show 
[03:53:30]  you and I go down to Wendy's and  flirt with the servers well does it  not get us free shit I mean we've  gotten more free frosties than I can  count on one hand and we get  discounts we get discounts yeah  exactly she goes no you get the  discount and it pays off doesn't it  because 812 oh wait I didn't put the  discount in 764 exactly I go yes  exactly yes that's what I need in  this life you just treat them like  human beings human beings that you  kind of want to nail give them that  impression well give them that not to  say that we do but give them that  impression women don't do that to men  all the time that's true to get what 
[03:54:00]  they want flaunt their shit exactly if  you'd be like look what's up baby yeah  can I get a chicken sandwich by the  way you're looking fine the triggers  are you new because you're actually one  of the sexy ones or something no you  know what Troy does what his strategy  is he goes like this hey what's up my  name's Troy I just I'm gonna order a  chicken sandwich but first I got to go  take a shit and then he comes back and  he gets whatever he wants for  practically for free yeah it's an  amazing thing let's play a bit real  quick it's short don't worry Roland I 
[03:54:30]  know you don't like when we go to  clips what Eric you're not a fan either  amazing well because I was just I found  it inspiring when we had the girl in  here from Penthouse her articles in the  new Penthouse magazine the women the  wing woman Bob Kelly farted with Amy  Schumer here Bob Kelly here Obie of  course is on vacation but and it just  the whole room I guess reeked it didn't  hit me because I was under event and  next to Bob which I was lucky but the 
[03:55:00]  whole room was horrible and it just  reminded me that that was certainly not  the most famous fart in Obie and  Anthony history Eric I think you know  where I'm going with this don't you  buddy that's cuz you got your head on  straight it wasn't the most famous  fart Jim nor and we know we're just  talking about farts with Julia too it's  very fart-oriented Monday today on the  Obie and Anthony show and here on after  Obie and Anthony live because Jim  Norton holds the prize for most famous  fart in the history of the Obie and

[03:57:30]  smoothie was warm right and you hear mm-hmm  in the background I turned to my left I  thought it was Z-Rock and I started  getting confused I didn't say a word  thank God and Anthony pretty much put his  foot in his mouth oh I certainly did and  he wanted an answer he wanted to know who  was talking to him little did I know it  was Jimmy's little hairless white backside I  got scared oh here it is from yesterday  with the TV edit cuz we got to play it  over here today mm-hmm all right we'll 
[03:58:00]  take a break I guess no I don't want to  take a break I don't have to that's  smoothly by the way with lukewarm what I  thought I heard mm-hmm who said that did  someone say something do you know I just  what I swear to God I got a gasser and it  went firm your ass talk to me and no you  totally answered answered your ass what'd you  say I answered Jimmy's tiny what from TV edit but we

[04:01:00]  their entries in by this friday noon noon on  friday eastern not eastern time so if  you're on the west coast guess what you got  a 9 a.m. cutoff and that's it and the  flight to book and the flight to book yeah  that's a good point roman if we pick you  because we're only gonna pick three  finalists I was at this wrestling show  that brought up with Iraq I guess we got  sidetracked this is why I brought it up  because uh one of the guys there was a  fan of the show and one of the female  wrestlers who was a good-looking girl her 
[04:01:30]  boyfriend was trying to uh convince her  the fan of the show to to enter into this  contest and I tried to tell her it's a  thousand dollars how's the entrance going  you remember how many we had on friday  slow slow moving now well  we haven't had any more entries listen  ladies let me talk I don't understand  it's a thousand dollars to go to lunch  with Bobo I would go to lunch with Bobo  for free of course not only is it a  thousand we're uh we're we're shifting 
[04:02:00]  towards Dave and Buster's and let me  tell you something you we what was a  thousand dollars for their entrees well  here's what this is a great thing ladies  it's a free lunch too we'll pay free  lunch and Dave and Buster's has those  deals where you get an entree and a game  card so if you order that we're paying  for your games too and this is what I  would do if I were you ladies you go to  Dave and Buster's you got to play some  games too you get Bobo since he's the  guy on the date to pay for your games like 
[04:02:30]  to pay to put the tickets on the card  for you that way you walk home with a  prize get Bobo to spend some money free  lunch a thousand dollars and a chance to  be a star on the Opie and Anthony show  and memories and memories you know they  have a Dave and Buster's that I think  Bobo and his dream date should do they  have a one of those picture booths where  where they combine your picture yeah like  what what your baby would look that is  so perfect and we'll pay for it and they 
[04:03:00]  have the Philly cheesesteak rolls oh those  are great and the Philly cheesesteak  rolls this is what I'm saying ladies  like let me tell you something to all  the women out there it will get to the  point where I I'm the chaperone in this  date okay I'm gonna have something to  eat okay some part of that lunch budget  is my lunch you'll definitely have lunch  whatever you want on the menu then  depending on how much money is left over  if there's not much money left over we're  gonna use the money to pay for your games  and Bobo will go hungry because Bobo  wanted to get some lunch so does the lunch 
[04:03:30]  come out of the thousand dollars no no no  this is what I'm trying to say we have a  separate lunch budget oh the thousand  dollars budget 20 bucks no it's a it's  good yeah the the thousand dollars is is  yours that's prize money you win the  contest you get the thousand dollars you  get you go to lunch with Bobo the lunch  budget is set up so that you don't even  have to think about it and let me tell  you unlimited drinks if you want something  that's not on the lunch budget I'll pay for  it and then have it expense so Rob 
[04:04:00]  cross will pay for it okay that's what  happens if the girls like a lush and she  wants to drink a lot well we'll probably  limit the amount of alcohol just for the  fact that if she has alcohol poisoning  boo we're responsible for what goes on and  it'll be 11 30 in the morning so we're  probably not good but you're not gonna  need alcohol you're gonna have all the  entertainment of being on a Dave and  Buster's lunch date with Daniel Bobo  curling so it's like and and we don't  have that many entries some of the  entrants that we've gotten a very good 
[04:04:30]  looking women yeah but that's not the  only criteria if you you have to if you  write a compelling paragraph about why  you should win and and you're that you're  gonna beat lady trucker that's for damn  sure and looks that that's that's not  gonna win this competition no no because  you just to be a finalist we judge and we  judge on our own criteria which is a  multitude of things and then once you get  here you just have to tell a story about  yourself that's memorable enough for  Bobo to remember if you're the ugliest 
[04:05:00]  girl here but the story you tell is the  simplest and bubble remembers you win  the date you win a thousand dollars you  win it all so I mean this is what I'm  saying I go because he has like a  hundred thousand points on those cards  we'll take Eric's card we'll steal it  from I really hope it's a pig and she  lets him put it in you'd like that yeah  bubble deserves I want to see bubble  get that's up to you I mean in terms of  like you want to watch I mean you  wouldn't want to watch that you don't  have to let Bobo quote-unquote get it in 
[04:05:30]  if you choose to after the date that's  up to you we're not going to tell you to  or not to but well what I what I am  saying is you don't have to touch the  guy you don't have to you can if you  want you don't have to touch the guy  you you should talk to him but it's fun  to talk to Bobo we do it all the time  you go to Dave and Buster's you get free  lunch you get a thousand dollars if you  want to enter the contest if things  works well the moves next door that's  right if you could go to a movie and  bubble will pay if you want to enter the
