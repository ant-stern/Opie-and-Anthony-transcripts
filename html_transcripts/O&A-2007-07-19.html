<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts proudly declaring themselves "radio shock jocks," rejecting the idea of "nice" radio.  They immediately launch into a discussion of a listener's humiliating strip search, detailing the experience with graphic language.  The show then celebrates Jimmy Norton's birthday, punctuated by the surprise announcement of staff member Travis's recent marriage and immediate return to work.

Next, Opie and Kenny recount their morning car accident, vividly describing the other driver and passengers (referred to as "minority" individuals) in their "souped-up" car, using derogatory language to describe their appearance and behavior.  They detail the confrontation, their lack of seatbelts, and police involvement, speculating on the other driver's potential intoxication.  The hosts then shift to a mocking comparison of the news coverage of a recent NYC steam pipe explosion to the 9/11 coverage, expressing frustration with the perceived overreaction and focus on terrorism.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focuses on an Opie and Anthony listener featured on NBC's "To Catch a Predator."  Audio clips play, revealing the listener's possession of marijuana and his suspicion of the situation due to the decoy's offer of brownies and need to "get changed." The hosts react with amusement and disbelief, highlighting the listener’s comments referencing the show and discussing a lawsuit against NBC related to the show and the suicide of a previous participant.  They also discuss other listeners caught in similar stings.  More audio clips from "To Catch a Predator" and further commentary conclude this segment.

Comedian Doug Stanhope's voicemail criticizing "To Catch a Predator" as entrapment fuels another discussion. The hosts compare it to Stanhope's own practice of recording conversations with online perverts, launching into a debate on the age of consent and legal issues, including a case of a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old resulting in a 10-year prison sentence for the older teen in Georgia. Listener calls follow, sharing personal anecdotes about relationships with significant age gaps. One caller confesses to a relationship with a 14-year-old when he was 20, sparking a lengthy, uncomfortable discussion.  This segment then shifts to repeated playings of Tay Zonday's "Chocolate Rain," with listener calls offering various interpretations of the lyrics, and humorous speculations from the hosts. Jimmy Norton's birthday is further celebrated with a surprise call from Ozzy Osbourne and a mention in the New York Times crossword puzzle.  The segment concludes with details of a "Duty Wars" competition, culminating in a graphic, undescribed event involving Pat Duffy, with a promise of online and live show video.

Opie describes a basement flood from a severe rainstorm, with five feet of water cracking his basement window and his girlfriend being instructed to "grab the gun." He uses a large quantity of diapers to absorb the water, leaving his basement resembling a "Gacy house." The conversation pivots to a news report on a Long Island tornado, mocking the exaggerated reporting style and referencing *Twister*.  Brian from St. Louis jokingly criticizes New Yorkers' weather reactions. Struff details an all-message board tailgate party for Norton's birthday, coinciding with their Mansfield, MA show.  "Fun Fact Thursday" features various calls, including a debate on a caller's fact about whale semen. Tay Zonday calls in to discuss "Chocolate Rain."  The show culminates in a birthday surprise for Jim Norton: Gina Lynn, a pornographic actress, arrives in studio in minimal clothing.  An extended conversation ensues, covering her career, new monster truck, and personal life, with explicit details of her work, including specific scenes, co-stars, and sexual preferences.  The conversation continues on XM radio.

The show continues with Gina Lynn and her husband, Travis, joined by Jill Nicolini from Channel 11 News. Graphic descriptions of oral sex, Travis's career in pornography, and explicit anecdotes involving Gina follow.  Travis recounts injecting his penis with an unknown substance, resulting in a prolonged erection requiring hospitalization. Discussions about performance-enhancing drugs and behind-the-scenes mishaps in the adult film industry continue. Jill Nicolini emerges from a cake shaped like genitalia.  Humorous banter ensues, covering her career, her image, and her "Dance Fridays" segment.  The conversation includes references to news personalities and Long Island locations.

A segment focuses on Jill Nicolini, discussing her experiences at WBLI, CW11, including anecdotes about wardrobe malfunctions and mic placement, her clothing habits, romantic life, and family, particularly her father ("Speedo Man").  Humorous, sexually suggestive jokes and comments about Nicolini's appearance and clothing are frequent. A caller mentions Nicolini’s brother’s restaurant, leading to a discussion about guest bartending. The hosts express fondness for Nicolini.  Nicolini's cousin, Rob, calls in, discussing a future Opie and Anthony show appearance. The segment includes photos, gifts (M&Ms, a hat, silicone butt implants), and more discussion of Jim Norton's birthday.  Gina Lynn and Travis briefly rejoin.

The final segment is highly vulgar, centered around listener "Bobbo" and his car radio problems, using extremely offensive language. Norton discusses a meeting with the CEO of Simon & Schuster.  Repeated references to a "rape kid in a crawl space" are made.  Al Roker's absence from the show is discussed with accusations of being "disrespectful." Offensive and sexually suggestive remarks regarding Jill Nicolini are made.  The show features "lines of the day," with more offensive jokes and banter.  The show ends with more crude jokes about Bobbo and a playful, confusing outro by Jill Nicolini.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Paris, you were strip searched.  Was the search something we like to call the old two-hander?  Oh, damn.  Did they do the old grip and rip?  This is where Hayman is going.  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, god damn.  Oh, god, you got a complete camel toe. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my god.  He's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, the phones are already lit.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, the ONA virus spreading across America.  First off, we have to acknowledge little Jimmy Norton's birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  All right, can we get rid of all this crap now?  No, it's very festive in here.  There's streamers.  There's balloons.  There's some dude over there getting ready to, what, make breakfast from the Brooklyn Diner? 
[00:02:00]  Is it the Brooklyn Diner this time around?  So we get a breakfast courtesy of Jim Norton's birthday.  That's good stuff.  Also, we got to congratulate Travis, one of our guys.  He's now a married man.  That's a surprise for everybody, huh?  Our little Travis, who came to us how long ago?  Vegas didn't even have odds on this one, man.  No.  They got odds on all of us, and they just left Travis out of it. 
[00:02:30]  That's what makes this completely amazing to everybody around here.  How long ago did Travis come to us?  A couple years ago, two years ago.  Yeah.  A young woman, he came to us, and now he's a married lady.  They have to go to Massachusetts to do it.  Yes.  Yeah, he's married.  He's got that ring on his finger.  I was like, I remember that.  I remember having that.  I go, I don't even know where mine is right now. 
[00:03:00]  We're going to have to get into the story a little later, but basically, he got married  yesterday, and he's back at work today.  I don't really understand.  I guess the honeymoon's about over.  I think it's some kind of shim-sham, but we'll talk to Travis later and find out the details.  Well, who gets married and then comes to work the next day?  People that need money.  You could have taken today and tomorrow off.  Oh, now you tell them.  But you never asked anyone. 
[00:03:30]  Paid?  And yeah, we would have paid.  Freaking Travis.  Look at these people running.  I can't get enough of this footage.  Well, I don't know.  You ran out of their shoes.  Look at all the shoes on the sidewalk.  Would you relax, people?  Well, of course, you're talking about the steam explosion here in New York City.  Yep.  Reminding us, of course, of 9-11, because that's how the news covered it.  Yeah.  That's how the paper's covering it.  I opened up the newspaper this morning, and I'm thinking, is this an old newspaper from 
[00:04:00]  9-11?  What happened?  I mean, obviously, it's tragic.  Someone lost their life, and dozens are injured.  What, a steam pipe just exploded, shooting steam 30 stories up in the air?  Yeah, it was like as high as the Chrysler Building.  Wow.  Yeah, it was just big plumes of steam going up, and geysers gushing, boiling water in  this 25-foot-wide crater that is now in Lexington Avenue. 
[00:04:30]  I got it, the most important thing.  Yeah.  It altered my commute and took me another additional five minutes to get in to work today, so it  affected me personally.  Yeah.  It's very upsetting.  Well, my commute was also altered by at least a half hour to 40 minutes.  How long?  Kenny and I were in a pretty interesting accident this morning.  I call it significant, but I don't know.  Kenny's like such a robot, like nothing phases this guy. 
[00:05:00]  It's amazing.  I was just telling Anthony before we cracked the mics, you know, it's so strange.  I wake up at 4.40 in the morning, and at 4.58, 4.59, we're in this accident where Kenny slams  into this guy that just runs a red light here in Manhattan.  Kenny drinking again behind the wheel?  Yeah, he's just sauced.  And I learned a lot of things about accidents today.  It's just amazing.  They go boom?  Well, first of all, we're just talking about crap, talking about, you know, Jimmy and his trip to Chicago. 
[00:05:30]  No big deal.  Next thing you know, I'm like, this is not happening.  It's all happening in slow motion.  There's a car right in front of us, and we're going at a pretty good clip, and Kenny's reflex is pretty amazing.  He jams on the brakes, locks them up, and I think we're going to get out of it without a hit.  And then all of a sudden, BAM!  I can't apologize enough to you for the trauma that I caused. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  And I got to be honest with you.  Just recently, Kenny and I were talking about seatbelts, and both of us don't wear seatbelts.  Why?  Our logic is, you know, what could possibly happen between picking me up and going to work?  You know, the drive is only, what, 15, 17 blocks, something like that?  You've got to strap in.  I'm one of these guys, you're around town doing errands, no seatbelt, but if you're on the highway and driving longer distances, then you put the seatbelt on. 
[00:06:30]  No.  That type of accident would have caused you more injury with a seatbelt.  Oh, all right.  I like the argument.  I like this.  Why is that?  Well, I don't know about that, Kenny.  He would have got a seatbelt burn.  It was very low impact.  The airbags didn't even deploy.  Did you hit your head?  On the windshield.  Enough said.  I don't think hard, but...  Let's just say you got a foot down, you jerked down a little bit, you could have lost your upper row of teeth, which you wouldn't if you had a seatbelt. 
[00:07:00]  It's not like you're going to be killed in an accident like that.  You could right now be in the hospital with three original teeth left, and the rest of them on the dashboard.  I'm kidding.  I'll collect up your teeth, G.A.  You want me to brush him before I bring him in so there's no blood on him?  So then we hit this guy pretty good, and what amazes me is, you know, we were going through greens.  He went through a red.  It's as simple as that. 
[00:07:30]  It's as simple as that.  So what kind of car was he driving, Kenny?  I was trying to describe to the guys, like a Corolla, like a Honda.  Like a little Honda Civic, a typical minority car.  So I said immediately, I went, oh, a Hispanic guy.  Right, exactly.  And Ope goes, yeah.  But you could tell by the car.  If it's like a little Honda, did it have a spoiler on the back?  Yeah, he, you know, he had the fake rims.  Yeah, yeah.  It was all souped up.  They call those cars rice.  Yeah.  It was souped up.  Rice car.  And so he hits, Kenny hits him pretty good. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, the guy is not driving home.  Yeah, his car, you know, right in the front axle, so his front wheel is built.  Oh, his wheels are bent at like a 45-degree angle.  And all of a sudden we're sitting there like, you've got to be kidding me.  This just happened, right?  And all of a sudden the guy jumps out of the car aggressively and goes right after Kenny.  I mean, not pushing him or anything, but right in his face like, you've got to be kidding me, dude.  You've got to be kidding me.  You messed up my ass.  You messed up my ass.  And I'm looking at this guy like, this is not happening. 
[00:08:30]  You so went through this red light.  Yeah.  It's not even a doubt in my mind that this guy, you know, didn't go through the red light.  And then he didn't even say that, you know, we went through a red light.  He was saying stuff like, man, you could have stopped in time.  You could have stopped.  You hit me.  You couldn't stop.  Here's something that happens in Manhattan that a lot of, it doesn't happen anywhere else  or in a few cities, I would gather, especially early in the morning.  The streets are pretty empty.  A few cars around. 
[00:09:00]  You see a row of lights as far as you can see.  They're just like lights, green or all red or changing.  Right.  The lights are timed that, and for me, my speed is 20 miles an hour.  Once I leave the tunnel, I hit Third Avenue and the lights are red.  Right.  But they're turning green.  As you go.  As I go.  So I do 20 and then by the time I get close to the light, boom, it's green.  And I go through that green.  The next light is red, boom, turns green. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And you can keep a steady pace as the lights are turning green.  A lot of people, though, outside the area have no concept of this.  There are people, though, that will blow through the red light.  Or before the light turns green, they're going too fast for the timing.  And they'll skate through the red and be in the middle or through the intersection by the time it turns green.  Right.  So, in essence, they're blowing the red light, you know, and that is something you cannot do because the other people coming the other way are playing the same game. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  But they're doing the wait for the green and zooming through.  So it's very tight.  That's all well and good.  But this was Broadway with a pretty wide medium.  I mean, the guy just flat out went through a red light.  I think, Kenny, weren't we behind on greens?  We were like one behind?  Yeah.  Meaning there was another green.  Oh, so you were well within the green.  Yeah, we weren't playing the, you know, the light is changing as we're going through the  I drive so cautious because I have such precious cargo in the vehicle. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, shut up!  Precious cargo.  Precious cargo.  Shut up!  So the guy jumps out and then his buddy jumps out and then I'm like, wow, this is going to turn into a pretty big problem because the guy is really aggressive.  Yeah.  And he's being aggressive knowing that he ran the red light.  Kenny, were you standing there?  Were you still sitting in the car?  No, I got out.  Well, first I had to make sure.  My priority was to make sure GH was okay. 
[00:11:00]  Of course.  You know, I even, you know how you put the instinctively, you put the arm out?  Oh, did you put the dad arm out?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the dad arm.  I call it the mom arm, but yeah.  I do the mom arm.  Yeah.  And then, like, you know, so I get out, you know, he gets out.  He's like five foot nothing.  With one of those, like, Justin Timberlake hats on, like just slightly askew.  Obviously coming home from a club.  It's so obvious these guys are coming home from a club.  You're either going to, everybody at that hour is either going to do their job in morning 
[00:11:30]  radio, or they've been drinking.  Well, we joke about it all the time.  I've caught many couples having sex in cars in my old neighborhood.  You see the walk of shame.  These girls just stumbling down the street in high heels like they can't even walk a  straight line anymore going back to their apartments.  We see all this fun stuff because we get up at a weird hour.  So the guy is, like, aggressively with his arms in the air.  You messed up my ass.  You messed up my ass.  Aw, and I just got it fixed.  Yeah.  Got it fixed.  That tells you something right there. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  And then two club girls come stumbling on him.  I'm like, oh, boy.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Was that music just blaring from the car?  I'm like, boy, if this isn't obvious.  You know, they're possibly drunk coming home from a club.  I have no idea if the driver was drunk.  So wait, was he showboating in front of the girls?  Because he had an accident.  He was probably embarrassed.  Probably.  Right.  So he's got to act.  Right.  Was he threatening to you or just people?  Nah, he's just like, dude, you know, you went through the red light. 
[00:12:30]  Why'd you hit me?  You could have stopped.  You know, he's just running his mouth.  He's a little.  And then a fake gangster jumps out of the car.  I'm like, what is going on here?  Another poser.  But you could tell he was just kind of like a fake gangster just wearing the clothes.  Yeah.  We're all right.  And then Kenny calls the cops.  They show up.  And the whole time, this guy's mouthing off like, I can't believe it.  You messed up my ass.  I can't believe you hit me.  All pissed off at us.  And then all of a sudden, Kenny, I guess, told one of the cops.  Can I say what you told him? 
[00:13:00]  The M?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Kenny, just, you know.  Well, just said, I'm MOS, member of society.  Service, service, service.  Service, sorry.  Well, I'm not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And also, one of the close.  Member of society doesn't quite fit, Kenny.  No, no.  There you go.  I'm just a guest.  I'm an outcast of society.  So, then one of the girls, like, kind of dressed like a hoochie, you know.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, man, he's MOS.  Damn.  And they knew what that meant? 
[00:13:30]  That's what I was saying.  Thank you, Anthony.  I don't know.  See, I got it wrong, and I'm with Kenny every day.  I said, member of society.  They knew what MOS was.  Maybe they thought he meant master of stupidity.  And I don't understand how Kenny keeps it together, because this guy is, you know, all  on his face, and Kenny is as stoic, making believe he doesn't even hear him, just staring  and ignoring him and looking at his damage of his car and just going about his business.  Because Kenny doesn't have any fear of that guy.  That guy is no fear of that guy. 
[00:14:00]  I understand.  You just watch him like an insect.  But it's not even the, no, it's not even that Kenny, I don't even question that.  I understand Kenny doesn't have, you know, isn't as scared of the guy, but, you know,  I thought Kenny would throw a few shots at him, but it doesn't even affect him on emotional  levels, what I'm getting at.  He wasn't scared of him.  And that's why Kenny wasn't, you know, you know, piping up.  It's just such a nuisance thing.  So then the driver who was like, you know, screaming, yelling at us because we messed  up his ass, he goes, yeah, well, I have ID too. 
[00:14:30]  And he's walking around like pulling his wallet out, trying to find some imaginary ID.  And I'm like, oh my God, what is going on here?  Well, he, no, he, it turns out he's in the military, so maybe he can go to the show for  free this weekend with his military ID.  Ah, there you go.  All right.  In Mansfield, because that's what's happening up there.  You know, because he, and then he started yelling at me, I serve my country.  What are you doing?  You know, he's like yelling that to me.  One of those things.  He probably drove a tank into his own convoy.  Yeah.  So, you know, the cops come, they have to take the report, and it's just a nuisance job for 
[00:15:00]  them too, you know, and then they have to write it up.  Driver one says, the other guy went through the red light.  Driver two says, you know, the other guy went through the red light.  And you know you didn't go through the red light.  And that's what amazes me.  That's tough to live with, because it's so obvious this guy went through the red.  And I know you're hearing our side of the story, but I'm telling you.  Yeah.  And it doesn't matter, because, you know, it is what it is now.  Now your insurance is going to go up.  We were going through greens at a pretty good clip, and this guy cut right in front of us, 
[00:15:30]  and that's it.  He went through a red light.  Is that a no-fault accident, because there's no witnesses other than you guys and them?  Like, they'll say one thing, you'll say another, and there's technically no.  Right.  And that sucks.  All four got together and said, look, you know, he went through a red.  And obviously we're saying he went through a red.  Right.  And that's it.  The insurance companies work it out amongst themselves.  Yeah.  You know, they just, you know, the insurance companies just...  They got a whole thing.  Yeah.  But what a weird, weird way to start a day, man. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I mean, not even awake 18 minutes, and you're in this, you know...  Yeah.  A bit of an accident.  You get squished up against a windshield, and you're like, wow.  And it could have been a lot worse.  Kenny, man, your reflexes are good, I gotta tell you.  And I'm so glad you drive a tank.  Yeah.  Just like...  That big foot just hitting the brake pedal.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Willie!  This is big Herman Munster foot slamming on the brakes of Dragula. 
[00:16:30]  Grandpa.  Fairly a scratch...  Well, you lost your bumper for the most part, but besides that...  Yeah, I'll need a new bumper, that's all, because they're all plastic now, these cars.  You drive a car like your personality, man.  Very just...  Dull.  Just...  Dull.  Just...  What, dry?  Yeah, just, I don't know.  Just a big, rock hard...  Lumbering thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Lumbering thing that has no emotion.  I'm just sorry you had...  It loses its bumper and goes, oh, well.  You know, you have to focus on being, you know, bright and cheery and entertaining, 
[00:17:00]  and that was no way for you to start your day, and I'm sorry about that.  It's the precious cargo.  Yeah, the precious cargo that he had.  So, um...  So, you left and they're waiting for a tow truck?  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, good.  You got that.  Yeah.  But now your insurance goes up, because this guy blew a red light with his, you know...  No, I got...  With his buddy and the two chicks coming home from a club.  That's wonderful.  And they didn't even check him?  Nah.  Why?  What's protocol on that? 
[00:17:30]  He's got a strong sign?  NYPD...  He's got...  Sorry, go ahead.  Sorry.  The NYPD always does a terrific job.  So, if there was any inclination that there was any, you know, something awry, they would  have taken the proper action, because they always do.  Dude, we support the NYPD.  I'm just wondering what protocol is.  Like, he didn't have any signs that he was...  Well, if there was a fatality, they would obviously have him checked, but in an accident like this,  it's like they look at him, they see if he's slurring or walking funny, and if not, you're 
[00:18:00]  free to go.  Yeah, in all fairness, you know, I didn't see any of that.  I was hoping I saw some of that.  Yeah.  Were the chicks fat?  Yeah.  They were wearing clothes they had no business being in, like, just blubber spilling out.  They had another tight tube top with their bellies hanging out.  They didn't hit their stomachs, though, and maybe it started swelling.  Was that it?  No?  No, their stomachs were...  They were hot, and they started swelling up.  Their stomachs were like airbags for them. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, anyway.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we're going to reset, but we, you know, it wasn't about  us today, but, you know, we get into this car accident, you got to bring it to the show.  We got to talk about Jimmy's birthday and Travis.  There's nothing going on with my birthday.  It's my birthday.  I'm a year older, and big deal.  You guys had an accident.  That's a story.  There's streamers here.  There's streamers.  It is very festive in here, and thank God you're here to enjoy it.  And it says, Big Boy Has a Birthday over there on a sign.  Very nice.  We're getting pictures for the website, and we'll talk about the front pages of the New 
[00:19:00]  York papers, get into the steam pipe explosion a little more, but I really thought I was  looking at old 9-11 papers.  Oh, and the news was treating it as such.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  And then everyone is on the phone's already lit for Phone Call Thursday and for Jimmy's  birthday, and they're talking about Chocolate Rain.  Jimmy doesn't even know about that because he wasn't here yesterday.  Also, we got a mention on Dateline.  Yeah.  That was exciting.  You want to play that next? 
[00:19:30]  I heard that.  We got to.  It's really good.  We got to play that a couple of times today.  We'll play it a million times.  Yeah.  All right.  Lots to do today.  Stay there.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Oh, a very special day.  It's little Jimmy Norton's birthday on the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Breakfast is being made by the Brooklyn Diner.  We got balloons and streamers and happy birthday messages and something in the ceiling with a  string attached.  I don't know what that's going to do later.  Who knows?  One of the girls left that.  Huh? 
[00:20:00]  Thank you, Dan.  I didn't hear you.  That's what I said, huh?  Oh, no, because you said there's something in the ceiling.  You talk very low sometimes, Jimmy.  I get shy.  You said there's something from the ceiling hanging with a string attached to it.  Oh, oh.  I just said a girl left it.  Okay.  See?  I wanted to enjoy the laugh, too.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore.  Hey, yo.  First off, I'm glad you're okay.  Secondly, did you guys hit hard enough for any of your marshmallows to deploy?  Oh.  Thanks for the concern, Steven S.  Bird in Philly.  Opie and Kenny had a Volkswagen commercial moment. 
[00:20:30]  Wham!  Have you seen those pretentious things?  Yeah, yeah.  It was like a slower version of that commercial.  Absolutely.  Happens like that.  Because I was telling Anthony during the break, because Anthony's like, Anthony thought we  could see this guy coming, and we just didn't see him.  He just appeared out of nowhere, because the medium's a bit high with some shrubbery, so  the car just came out of nowhere.  And we did have one of those Volkswagen moments, and I hate those effing commercials.  I've never seen the commercial.  And those commercials don't make me drive safer or any of that crap. 
[00:21:00]  So two guys are just driving, talking about nothing, and all of a sudden, a car's in front  of them.  They get in an accident, and they go like, holy, and it cuts off to, you know, Volkswagen.  Yeah, yeah.  Basically saying that Volkswagen is the safest car on the planet.  That's all because they had the accident, and they're still sitting there.  And the whole thing is from inside the car, and they're just kind of chit-chatting, and  you don't know what's going to happen.  It's like, what is this boring conversation?  And then all of a sudden, they're just, bam! 
[00:21:30]  You whack like that.  When it first came out, it was kind of a, you know, kind of grabbed your attention.  Yeah.  Now they're just creepy.  I don't, you know, I don't want to see crap like that while I'm trying to watch my TV.  How great would it be if they died, and the whole commercial was, it may look nice, but  you better drive careful.  The end of the commercial is just two decapitated torsos, and a guy on a bike is okay.  And then in the boardroom, they're harrumphing, and they can't figure out why sales are way, 
[00:22:00]  way down.  I thought this one was going to work.  This is a great campaign, Stevens.  And then Ralph from Belleville, New Jersey, always good for one every day.  He points out that yesterday, I said that we don't have to worry about hurricanes in  New York, only exploding manholes.  Pretty prophetic.  Oops.  Prophetic.  Yeah, prophetic.  Thank you.  Or pathetic.  But I did say, yeah, we don't have to worry about hurricanes.  We did a whole thing on hurricanes, because out of nowhere, Jimmy, yesterday, the news had 
[00:22:30]  to talk about Category 5 hurricanes in New York City.  And we said that the weather doesn't really, it's not an issue here in New York, weather  related, like disastrous things like that.  As we got through one of the worst rainstorms I've ever seen in my life, and a tornado hits  in East Islip, Long Island.  Yeah.  So maybe we ought to just keep our stupid mouths shut.  We're trying to find the clip, because I said, yeah, we have to worry about dumb stuff  like exploding manhole covers.  And then we have this steam pipe explosion in the city yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Massive.  With steam going 30 stories in the air.  The front pages of the newspapers, Midtown Volcano.  Killer steam blast.  You know, one person died, and that sucks, and dozens are in there.  Killer.  But they're making this look, it looks like you're looking at 9-11, you know, newspapers.  Yeah, got a tow truck in the hole.  There's a big crater, like 25-foot crater in the middle of Lexington Avenue.  Well, the Daily News writes, the earth opened, deadly steam pipe blast rips apart Midtown. 
[00:23:30]  But doesn't that show you, like, how much...  And then, of course, Newsday says it all, blast of fear.  Life, it's like, it's like on 9-11, especially in the first building, there were people who  never, they never know that the plane hit the building, because there was guys sitting  on the toilet in Tower 1 that had no idea.  Just, yeah.  All of a sudden, their life is over.  Boom, it's gone.  Like, this guy's walking, all of a sudden you blow up, like, there probably wasn't even  a second of recognition.  Yeah.  He was dead.  You're just crossing the street, you go over this, steam pipe explodes, you get launched 
[00:24:00]  with 200-degree steam.  You're just done.  His last thought might have been, oh my God, that muffin looks...  Like, and you cease to exist.  All you've worked for, all you've struggled for, every prayer you've said...  That's it.  ...and you cease to exist after that muffin looks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, that sucks.  That's some reality.  Hopefully, that was his last thought.  Yeah.  Could have been a lot worse.  My wife sucked you up. 
[00:24:30]  Anthony pointed out, they have some really interesting footage on TV of a sidewalk with  just shoes all over the place.  People were running so hard to get away that they just left their shoes behind.  They ran out of their shoes to run away.  Now, I understand sandals and most women's shoes, but I saw a few sneakers and stuff.  Sneakers.  I'm like, how does that happen?  They just ran out of their shoes.  And there's footage of people running away, looking over their shoulder, horrified looks  on their face.  One tool looks right into the news camera as he's just running.  I mean, people are petrified, especially in this city, in New York City, about what the 
[00:25:00]  hell is going on.  Anything out of the ordinary, they just run in fear.  Well, in fairness, if you're walking along and all of a sudden you see an explosion that  hits the size of the Chrysler building, you probably are going to ampscray.  Yeah.  That's frightening.  And the sound that it was making is supposed to be, have been just ridiculous.  It sounded, they said, like a building coming down, because that escaping steam was making  a rumbling sound. 
[00:25:30]  Really?  So it was scaring the crap out of people that were nearby and listening to it.  But the whole, that whole running thing just gets me.  You see people just tearing ass.  And the reporters are immediately, like, they wanted the terror angle so bad, but so many  people, the mayor, the police, the fire department was coming out saying, look, this is not terrorist  related.  And they still couldn't.  They said, this is absolutely not a terrorist event. 
[00:26:00]  And the news was putting up something, something that left a little bit of chance.  A little doubt.  It said, reports are saying, are saying not a terrorist event.  They didn't say, this is absolutely not a terrorist event.  Well, they're experts at semantics, is what they are.  Yeah, they want people to go, is it?  Does that mean it might be?  Because I came home from the gym, and I see it on TV, and I asked, whoa, is this terrorism?  And Lindsay's like, I'm not really sure. 
[00:26:30]  They're saying, they're still looking into the fact that it's, if it's terrorism or not.  And then I watched it a little longer, and then they kind of hinted that the mayor's  saying it doesn't look like, most likely it's not, you know, even though he just flat  out came out and said, what?  It's not terrorism, right?  But the news kind of messed around with the wording a little bit to get you to listen a  little longer, or, excuse me, watch a little longer. 
[00:27:00]  Because they want, the news wants another terrorist event.  Oh, do they want one?  And anytime something like this happens, they just love the gap of time between when it  happens and when somebody says it's not a terrorist event.  Because the speculation, they get all the talking heads on there, well, this could be a terrorist  event.  Just, stop with the fear mongering.  So what happened?  Like, what happened?  The steam was building up.  They're saying because of the thunderstorms we had in New York City yesterday. 
[00:27:30]  There's so much water pouring into these.  But the water that was pouring in was a lot colder and that caused pressure to build up.  Yeah, it actually cracked.  The pipe is 80 years old.  It's an 80-year-old, like, 20-inch diameter steam pipe that comes in from Queens.  And all the water that poured into these manhole covers and the drainage on the side of the  streets, it just seeped in there, hit the pipe. 
[00:28:00]  You get a little cooling with the superheated pipe.  Maybe some of the insulation is torn away.  And it just cracks.  Bam.  You get that much pressure on there.  It doesn't take much weakening of the pipe to just blow this thing apart.  That's what happened.  Boom.  Took out a 20-foot crater.  Just sent pieces of the street, concrete, asbestos, and boiling hot water.  Well, that was the other thing the news was scaring everybody about. 
[00:28:30]  Asbestos everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Stay out of the area.  Asbestos everywhere.  Asbestos.  Wait, who died?  Was it the guy in this tow truck?  Was that the guy who got blasted?  I don't know.  They aren't saying who...  Well, you got to think, the guy in that tow truck that's on the front page of the Daily  News, you know, he could be in a bit of a...  Yeah, that doesn't look like the place to be.  In a bit of a pickle, Jimmy.  That looks like the worst possible place to be, in the middle of the crater.  Yeah.  And it was just bubbling, boiling water in there.  It's like he drove into a pot of boiling water.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  A muddy, boiling water.  By the way, people are obsessed, so let me get this out of the way so we can move on.  All right, I get it.  It's a median, not a medium.  Sorry.  I didn't catch that you said that.  Sorry.  All right.  God.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, our news out here reported at 5 o'clock last night about your little steam explosion,  and they said, authorities are unsure if it's a terrorist event.  Oh, they were just.  They were positive it wasn't. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, they knew right away, but they were chomping at the bit.  They couldn't wait to get that on your TV.  Couldn't wait.  I was like, yeah, right.  Sure it is.  They're going to blow up a steam pipe.  I don't think so.  No, I mean, you know, TV is entertainment.  They're not the news.  No.  Why would they tell you that it's not terrorism right away?  They want you to watch a little longer.  Because it looked like it could have been, because the smoke, the people running, the 
[00:30:00]  debris in the street, it looked like a 9-11 type scene.  You know, the plumes of smoke were going as high as the Chrysler building.  We were talking about dirty bombs yesterday.  It looked like something a dirty bomb would do, right?  Let's go to Dave on Long Island.  Dave.  Hey, if you read further into that story, guys, the only person that died died of a  heart attack.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Yep.  I only read the first two paragraphs of every story.  That's all you need.  No, like most of the...  It's worth reading.  They did research on that. 
[00:30:30]  Most people only read the first couple paragraphs of every story in a newspaper.  So they try to get all the facts in the first couple of paragraphs, two, maybe three  paragraphs, and then they kind of start just babbling after that.  So they'll try to probably skewer it a certain way, and then maybe they know they can put,  like, all right, a lot of the facts after it.  Right.  But if they want to spin it a certain way, they'll put that in the first two.  Yeah.  They did research on that, and that's what the average person does with a newspaper.  Before the emails come in, it's skew.  Did I say skewer?  Yeah.  I meant to say skew. 
[00:31:00]  I just went, er.  It's his birthday, though.  But it's not mispronunciation.  Yeah, but you know, you got to let him slide.  It's his birthday.  Oh, no.  He's right, though.  I did say skewer instead of skewer.  I like skewering it.  You're putting it on a kebab.  Well, I meant to just speak about it very harshly.  Yes.  Skewered.  Skewer.  All right.  We got...  Skewer.  We'll talk more about the steam pipe explosion.  We also have to...  What happened here?  Oh, thank you, Dave.  What happened?  I don't know if this is good for the show, but my cell phone was ringing off the hook. 
[00:31:30]  Off the hook.  Isn't that funny?  You never put it on a hook.  I know, but it's...  But it's old school chat.  You're like, oh, the phone was ringing off the hook.  It still works.  I hang mine.  It's right by my coat.  There's a little hook, and it rings and falls off.  Yeah, you know.  And then Steve got a voicemail from Doug Stanhope.  He saw the Dateline thing as well, and he was laughing, and...  I guess he sounds really drunk or on something, and he's like, I just saw you guys on Dateline. 
[00:32:00]  Well, I knew about this.  I mean, I'll catch a predator.  I knew about this over a month ago when I had spoken on the street, an impromptu conversation  with my good friend, Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  As I was going to John's Hog, I saw Chris Hansen on the street as I was crossing the street,  and he said, hey, Anthony.  How you doing?  I'm like, oh, Chris.  What's up?  He goes, I've been meaning to talk to you guys. 
[00:32:30]  And then he explained this situation that happened and was shown on Dateline last night.  And I got a good chuckle out of it.  Yeah.  One of our listeners, whoopsie.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Oh, you know, the suits upstairs are like, oh, my God.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  This is a great one.  Scott and Todd's listeners would never be caught in Dateline.  Yes, they would be.  Catch a predator house.  On the other side of it, they would be.  People are showing up to see them. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, Paul asks really fast.  Thank you.  From New Rochelle.  Opie, the tow truck driver is in a medically induced coma with 80% of his body burned.  Oh, man.  So he's in very bad shape.  Thanks for that update there, Paul.  80%.  So, yeah, to catch a predator last night, an ONA fan got caught in the sting.  Yep.  Boy, and Hanson has done our show a couple times.  We get along with the guy big time.  And like Hanson said, you know, Hanson kind of gave him the inside scoop that this was coming down eventually. 
[00:33:30]  It's one of those things where he's explained it when he's been on this show that it's just from every walk of life.  These people, they could be doctors.  Oh, nice way to spin it.  Lawyers, as a matter of fact.  Well, we've seen the rabbi.  We've seen the lawyers.  We've seen the doctor.  NBC is facing a lawsuit from a family member of a gentleman that was caught in one of the stings and ended up killing himself. 
[00:34:00]  And now the family is suing.  And listening to this guy's lawyer was just disgusting me.  He was saying that this is the type of stuff that happens when amateurs dabble in an area that should be handled by professionals like the police department.  Now, they're working with the police department.  The thing is, they put no blame on the guy who was having this allegedly having, but you know how they deal with it on the show, this sexually explicit conversation with an underage person and was trying to maybe set something up as a meeting. 
[00:34:30]  And, of course, being in the position he was in, I believe he was a prosecutor, you're screwed.  Your whole career is down the toilet.  You're just thinking about that.  Your family life, your friends, how you face your friends when you're sending horrid things to underage girl or boy.  And he decided to off himself. 
[00:35:00]  How great is that?  It's a Roman way out.  He saved the state the money.  He understood that it was going to be a trial.  That's what you should do.  Just kill yourself.  Do us all a favor.  Save the state money.  Save your family a little bit of the dignity.  And that's that.  But, eh, family's suing.  Well, let's see where that'll go.  The NBC says it's without merit.  Right.  But last night, there was an ONA fan on To Catch a Predator.  Here's the audio.  Do you want some brownies?  I made some.  What?  Did you dose them? 
[00:35:30]  What?  Did you dose them?  No.  They're really good at having them.  Are they using a real chick now?  Yeah, they use this.  Because I haven't watched Catch a Predator in a while.  I mean, I was still watching when you hear just a voice from another room.  But I read somewhere that they're actually going to bring the girl into the room.  Well, a lot of guys are getting suspicious when the girl would just kind of show her back  and kind of call out, oh, I'm in here.  Right.  And the second the guy walks in the door, she just kind of maybe look a little over her  shoulder and go, okay, I'll be right back. 
[00:36:00]  Well, now they got this girl who really looks like a young girl.  How old is she?  I have no idea.  She's probably 18 or 19 at least.  But she looks really, really young.  And she's standing there looking right at him going, hi, how are you?  I got some brownies or something.  And that's when he said, what, are they dosed?  And she's like, no, they're not dosed.  And then she does the old, I'm going to go get changed bit.  Oh, boy.  And that's where this guy actually, like a light went off in his head like, uh-oh, I think 
[00:36:30]  I've seen this before.  Oh, boy.  I thought our listeners were smarter than this.  Well, this guy apparently was a little too late.  Oh, man.  Why us?  Yeah.  Why us?  Why does she have to change?  Why can't she just sit there and watch the bust happen?  What, are they afraid it's going to affect her?  Oh, no.  Well, congratulations to everybody.  We finally made it into the stream of consciousness of pop culture.  We're fans of the show.  It's an honor.  Oh, my God.  I'm one of our dopey listeners.  It just doesn't feel the same when, like, Jay Leno mentions the Opian Anthony show. 
[00:37:00]  Or David Letterman does a little monologue joke about some dumb thing we did.  This is a little different.  I'm not getting the same feeling.  No, not the same vibe.  But, no, they should actually make the girls sit there in their pigtails and actually be  on, like, a police walkie-talkie while this guy's like, oh, no.  How did I think you were nine?  Oh, there's a problem here.  Just once in my dumb career, I want to be able to bring, like, video of stuff that has  happened to us on TV and play it for my entire extended family. 
[00:37:30]  I'm always hiding in the corner, like, oh, please don't mention that one of our fans was  on Catch a Predator.  Please don't mention it.  Please don't mention it.  Better get to work on curing a disease or something because it ain't happening with your  ass in that chair.  Yesterday on Good Morning America, they're doing some story on how, like, news spreads  worldwide really fast, and out of nowhere, they're showing a newspaper with our faces  on it and it says, you're fired.  Fired.  It's just stock footage.  I'm like, oh, God.  We were hoping it's stock footage, and it turned out to be. 
[00:38:00]  Thank God, yeah.  We never know.  We're always the last to know.  All right, here.  Let's get back to this audio.  Do you want some brownies?  I need some.  What?  Did you douse them?  What?  Did you douse them?  No.  They really got to have them.  Did you bring the smoke?  Can I just roll it up wherever?  Yeah.  Let's check it out.  Let's check it out.  He wants the decoy to smell the marijuana he brought.  It smells good. 
[00:38:30]  All right, I'm just going to go get something to drink while you finish that up, okay?  You want something?  It seems something about that line gets this man thinking.  He's heard it before.  He's heard it before.  Of course he's heard it before on our show.  You could see it.  You could see it in his face when you watch the video.  The second she goes, all right, I'm going to go get something to drink.  He just goes, oh my God.  First of all, I ain't getting laid.  Right.  Second of all, I'm going to jail. 
[00:39:00]  I've been caught on this stupid show that I've laughed at on the Opie and Anthony show.  And he has pot.  Yeah.  It's like, it just gets worse.  Now, dude, you're the guy we're laughing at.  Yeah.  And there'll be another one.  There's someone guaranteed.  There's an Opie and Anthony listener right now.  Listening right now.  And it's going to get caught.  It's going to happen to me, man.  Hey, this is funny.  What a dope this guy is.  And he'll be sitting in that chair with the brownies in front of him.  Yeah.  The girl going off to do something going, hey, wait a minute. 
[00:39:30]  And he'll go, hey, I liked you on Opie and Anthony because I was there that day.  I'm the GM of the station.  Did you think your braces would help you with these young girls?  Let's go to Dirty Joe real fast.  Dirty Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  You see, guys, here's the big difference.  You'll never, ever catch a Ron and Fez fan on Dateline. 
[00:40:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  I don't think so.  Who won Duty Wars?  That's all I have to say.  Who won Duty Wars?  Duty Wars.  We have to take a break before we get to the next clip?  The next clip is the one.  His name was TomC169.  All right, we've got to take a break.  When we get back, Chris Hansen introduces himself.  Guy lets him know he was funny on Opie and Anthony. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Big fan.  We'll play that clip.  Where is he?  Huh?  I'd love to talk to him.  This guy?  Yeah, where is he?  He's a fan of the show.  Come on.  Give us a call.  Maybe he's not in jail yet.  Maybe he made bail.  I've got to tell you, the next clip, as creepy as this is, and these guys are creeps, the next  clip's going to make you laugh.  Simple as that.  Of course.  Simple as that.  We'll play it next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Do you want to grab me my face off? 
[00:41:00]  Huh?  What?  Do you have to touch them?  Yeah.  What?  Did you have to touch them?  No.  They're really good.  I had them before.  Did you bring the smoke?  Can I just roll it up wherever?  Yeah.  Let's check it out.  Let's check it out.  He wants the decoy to smell the marijuana he brought.  It smells good.  All right.  I'm just going to go get something to drink while you finish that up.  Okay?  You want something?  It seems something about that line gets this man thinking. 
[00:41:30]  Perhaps he's heard it before.  And that's where we're at.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Perhaps he's heard that before.  Yeah.  It turns out on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  You are listening to an Opie and Anthony fan.  Yeah.  A fan of the show getting a little lesson.  Getting caught on Catch a Predator last night with Chris Hansen.  A talking to.  Wow.  I guess Assault on the Media is back or something?  Yeah.  I mean, what's going on?  What's going on here, huh? 
[00:42:00]  Dug out Doug 13.  Oh, my God.  Why are we even playing this today?  This man calls himself Steve from Bayshore.  You wanted to have sex in a Nazi uniform.  His screen name is Dog Ass Sniffer from Woodside. 
[00:42:30]  Steve C. sent child pornography with a Foundry logo on it.  We traced the Foundry watermark.  We couldn't believe how stupid a man could be.  Well, here we go.  The next clip says it all.  By the way, I like all the fact that  that's the only one that can do Chris Hansen,  me and you just kind of go, we just move our mouth a little bit.  Oh, it's just easy.  You do it.  Oh, all right.  Look, why? 
[00:43:00]  Why?  Why do I have to see this on Pal Talk today?  H-Cup Jane decided that she needs to smoke a joint.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  There's H-Cup Jane performing for everybody on Pal Talk today.  I'm looking for her name.  What is it?  That's a good boyfriend.  Look at her boyfriend.  Go to Rich W.  I don't think you want to go see this one, A.  Oh, okay.  You won't find him at situps.com.  Oh, yeah.  Situps.com. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Wow, there is like some action going on there.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Yeah, why are you making him laugh?  Oh, no, I ruined it for everybody.  Yeah, you just blew it, man.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He's wearing a lot of happy birthday tiara.  I think it's some bizarre...  I think they were doing this for your birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, guys.  I don't know.  I think they're doing some weird things on Pal Talk for your birthday.  It was very nice.  He was standing up, and H-Cup Jane was very sexy.  He was kind of just hugging his waist, and they were looking at the camera.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all that was going on.  All right, anyway.  You ruined it.  I ruined it for the other Pal... 
[00:44:00]  You know, somebody was watching that getting close, and I just...  Yeah, you ruined it.  I'm sorry.  All right, here we go.  So, Chris Hansen introduces himself.  Now, Chris Hansen walks into the room, and here's the clip that everyone's talking about  today, as far as our show goes.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right down there.  No, keep your hands right where I can see them.  All right?  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot.  What was your plan tonight? 
[00:44:30]  Do you want him to come down, you know?  Come down.  Talk to her?  Talk to her.  You're Chris Hansen?  I am.  Have you seen this show?  You have to.  I thought you were real funny on Opian Athlete.  Oh, you listen to me on Opian Athlete?  Can I honestly tell you something?  Yeah, please.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this to happen.  Oh, my...  Oh, my...  I think the beauty is that not only is he a potential pedophile, but he does drugs.  Yeah.  Which is great. 
[00:45:00]  He's smoking pot.  He's offering pot to the youngster.  Yeah.  And trying to have sex with the youngster, and he's a fan of the program.  Ah, it's welcome.  Welcome, sponsors.  Yeah, there you go.  Are you kidding me?  Why not?  You were funny on Opian Anthony.  It's great.  You saw me on Opian Anthony.  Oh, you saw me on Opian...  You heard...  I was very funny, wasn't I?  You see, Chris gets all...  Okay, look.  I'll sneak out the back door.  Give me a little compliment.  I think that's why him and Anthony meet.  I mean, it's not an accident. 
[00:45:30]  I don't think Chris tells him what houses to avoid.  Yeah.  Shelby 520.  No way from this house.  I gotta hear that last part again.  Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  You have, too.  I thought you were real funny on Opian Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opian Anthony.  Can I honestly tell you something?  Yeah, please.  I almost think in the back of my mind that I almost wanted this time.  Why?  Chris wasn't funny on Opian Anthony.  He was very interesting.  It was a great interview. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  He wasn't really funny.  He was just talking about pedophiles.  Yeah.  He had a couple of good lines.  Yeah, but for a pedophile, that's probably hilarious.  Hysterical.  Right.  Pedophile talk.  Chris is that Richard Pryor.  Yeah.  Kenny, what do you got?  You guys shouldn't feel bad about that because you're so entertaining.  You have a wide, diverse audience because you're so popular and well-liked.  The Wall Street professional all the way down to the pedophile.  Yeah.  You guys can't help it that you're that good. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Kenny.  You guys want to hear some more from this guy?  I thought you were going to say throw up after hearing that.  No kidding.  Certainly.  Well, we can't avoid it.  Everyone's talking about it today.  My phone, like I said, was ringing off the hook.  Your phone was...  I meant Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  No, the pedophile audio is fine.  It's just...  Look at that.  He tries to say nice things.  A guy says he knew what was happening as soon as he saw the brownies.  What's so funny about the brownies?  Right when I saw the brownies, I knew.  You knew what? 
[00:47:00]  I knew I was going to be running into you.  I think that's the first time we've had brownies.  I'm kind of talking about it just because, you know, I shouldn't have.  So you think it's funny?  No, I don't think it's funny.  I mean, it's funny how dumb I'm really turning into.  He should have had, like, a Pest t-shirt on.  That would have been great.  Why are they still going with the snack thing?  Because Chris Hansen loves snacking.  But Chris Hansen goes, this is the first time we've used brownies.  Yeah, but you've used cookies and lemonade, you know. 
[00:47:30]  First time we've used brownies.  How about a beer?  Now we're going to have a beer there for them.  Take the brownies out of the mix.  The brownies have blown the cover.  The cover's being blown by snack foods.  Because no beer company will sign off on it, though.  So they'll have to use, like, that yellow beer from all in the family.  Yeah.  Waffle, no-name beer.  You know, no frills spelled with a Z.  Yeah, let's go to Mongo, the trucker.  Mongo!  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I think this guy definitely wins the assault on the media conference. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I would say.  Screwed up the line, too.  He gets the O&A mention in there.  Yeah.  He gets a lot of FaceTime.  It would have been nice if he mentioned Jimmy's book.  But, ah, it's okay.  Well, Mr. Self-Centered just has to worry about going and getting arrested.  Well, we learn more about this guy that might listen to our show every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  I hear he's a huge fan of Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  Blame it on them. 
[00:48:30]  How many times have you seen the show?  I'm a religious watcher, I suppose.  A religious watcher?  Well, I watch it whenever I can.  Sometimes I'll go, you know, on that clips on the internet.  So you watch it on the internet, too.  I watch it whenever I can.  He's actually doing a survey to find out what makes his show popular before the guy gets  arrested.  Yeah.  So, you've seen the show a lot.  You watch it on the internet.  Do you feel it's top-heavy with commercials?  Would you buy a DVD box set? 
[00:49:00]  That's great.  He's taking a survey.  How do you not love Chris Hansen?  This guy's great.  I'm not sure anyone I can.  I love it when they play the clips on all the radio shows.  Did you ever imagine that you'd be...  You heard it.  All the radio shows.  Yeah, see, it's not just us.  See?  He's not a faithful listener.  Well, that's probably a retake.  He probably said Opie and Anthony again, and Chris said, could you make it look like  we hit a bigger audience?  Yes, a bigger audience than just them. 
[00:49:30]  He's working them.  I mean, you're pretty bad, but they are the scourge of society.  We don't want to be associated.  Did you ever imagine that you'd be featured on one of our shows?  Is there a hidden camera somewhere?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of them.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's so smooth.  A whole bunch of them, and all of a sudden they went to the multi-camera shot.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and the cameras started coming in, and then the guy starts remembering the show 
[00:50:00]  and knowing what comes next.  Realizing, oh, boy.  Yeah, oh, boy, I don't just get to walk away from this, do I?  This isn't season one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I liked season one.  Hey, Chris, can we go back to season one where they just kind of leave?  I want you to take that with you, though, since it's an illegal substance, right?  So he reaches into his pocket, gets out his bag, and puts the marijuana away.  Counts outside.  Since he already suspects what's waiting for him outside, he takes his time getting ready to leave. 
[00:50:30]  And just as the man figured, the police are waiting outside.  Police, stop!  Hands behind your back.  Oh, and there he goes.  There he goes.  There goes one of our fans.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Use all the listeners we can get. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  We can't have you guys getting arrested.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop.  Stop.  Dummies.  Well, it gets interesting because, like I said, everyone's phones were ringing because  a lot of people saw this last night.  And one of the people that saw this was good old Doug Stanhope.  Oh.  He probably got it sold in the pot.  Here's a voicemail from Doug Stanhope, everyone.  Steven, it's Douglas Stanhope.  We're drinking wine at the border here. 
[00:51:30]  And, oh, my God.  Some, to catch a predator guy, just mentioned ONA as though you've had this Chris Matthews  f***ing entrapment connoisseur as a f***ing guest.  And this guy knows him from you guys.  Oh, I want to, I would like a fight. 
[00:52:00]  That's such a dog s*** program.  We baited long before perverted justice f***ing baited.  I'll talk to you on the air or on the phone.  It's dog s***.  It's bull s***.  You act like this.  And, ah, I won't talk now.  I'll save it.  End of message.  I forgot about that.  Okay.  I thought he was just annoyed because maybe he wants to troll the internet for youngsters  and Chris Hansen's getting in the way.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Called him Chris Matthews.  Yeah.  Uh, but I forgot about that guy.  Uh, Doug used to do this.  Doug would do this.  He would, uh, carry on conversations with these perverts and, uh, post it online.  So he was kind of the guy that not started this.  I mean, I'm sure other people might've been doing it, but he kind of, uh, brought it to  light.  I heard about him doing it before I ever heard about Chris Hansen doing it.  And did he, um, why did he say that he says it's a bad show because it's entrapment or 
[00:53:00]  whatever, but it's like, eh.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess he's just.  Doug, what are you doing?  Well, why don't we get Doug on the phone?  Yeah.  Is he, is he awake?  It's pretty early over there.  He sounded like he was having a really good night, so.  Every time I picture Doug because he's out there in what, Arizona?  He's near like the Mexican border.  Yeah.  He's, I just picture him naked, uh, high on mushrooms in the desert.  Like, like with his arms stretched out, looking at the sky, just seeing hallucinations.  Seeing more stars than anyone else.  That, that's all I picture. 
[00:53:30]  A cactus.  Yeah, yeah.  And a coyote.  A coyote, right.  There's a coyote, uh, the, the sky is just breaking, uh, a daylight.  Lots of red.  And he's so effed up.  Yeah.  Uh, uh.  Like Tony Soprano.  Remember when he did the mushrooms?  Yeah, sure.  Uh, Steve on Long Island, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Love the show, man.  Hey, guys, you know, this guy that got busted, like, I know, you know, he's a pedophile and  all that, but don't you feel a little bad for him?  Like, doesn't he seem like just such a regular guy? 
[00:54:00]  He looks like a regular guy.  The video's up on our website right now.  I was expecting, uh, to see maybe, I don't know what I was expecting, I guess.  Maybe an older guy or something, but he doesn't even look like he's 30 years old.  I don't feel bad for him, dude, because like, like anybody, you, it's like they're going  to meet a kid for sex.  You can't feel bad for him.  Yeah, it's a bit, uh, a bit creepy, don't you think, Steve?  Yeah, I know, but, I know, guys, yeah, I guess you're right, but I'm just saying, you  know, he, he ain't that much older than her, and you know, every guy has those little  thoughts in their mind. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, the thoughts in your mind between, you know, looking at a 16-year-old and go, wow,  is different than like being 21 or 22 and going to pick up a 12-year-old.  I mean, it's just, it's just a different thing, man.  The guy's 25.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, this, this woman, what is she?  She's supposed to be 14.  14.  Wow, 14 is...  25, yeah, it's a little too old.  That's, that's a bit rough, don't you think?  They should go younger than that, though.  They should make the girls 12, because that, that even makes the guy a bigger creep.  It's probably harder to do.  I think...  Hey, guys, thanks, Joe.  You guys are the best, bro.  Thanks, Steve. 
[00:55:00]  It's, that's probably a lot harder to do, is to get somebody to come off like a 12-year-old.  I think they figured out that age perfectly.  They're like, you know, 14.  Not too old where it's like, hey, you know, I've walked the streets.  I've seen some girls leaving school.  You know, you see some 16-year-old girls leave.  I don't care who the hell you are.  You're, you're, you're looking at some of these girls.  Some have matured.  Some haven't.  The ones that have, you look at and go, holy Jesus.  Well, there are guys having legitimate relationships. 
[00:55:30]  We could take calls all morning that are 19, 20, going out with 16-year-olds, 17, you  know what I mean?  17-year-olds.  Yeah.  Everyone is aware, both families, but technically it's, it's illegal.  That guy's in jail in Georgia.  That, that guy for getting oral at a party from a girl, she went and they filmed it.  Yep.  And it's on film and he was 19 and she was 17.  There's a loophole in the Georgia law, which this guy was charged as a pedophile and given  10 years in jail for having sex with a minor. 
[00:56:00]  And the minor was 17 and he, and he was 19?  19.  And it's completely, that's, I think she was 15 and he was 17.  You know what, I apologize.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what was it?  She was 15, he was 17.  I'm sorry, she was 15, he was 17.  I'm wrong.  At the time.  That's ridiculous.  That's like a, that's like a senior going out with a sophomore.  Yeah.  That's not happening.  That's happening in every city in America.  Every town in America.  Everybody, Jimmy Carter even wrote, the attorney general wrote, and the prosecutor does not 
[00:56:30]  want to let him out because the prosecutor would then...  Look bad.  These, these, prosecutors, man, really can be complete scum.  Well, and they got, they got a win-loss record that they brag about.  Right.  That's the biggest problem.  That's what they run on.  They don't want to admit to a defeat.  Yes, Dan.  A recent update in that, in that story is that the prosecutors get, possibly getting  in trouble for distributing child pornography because he made the tape available to the  media and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, great. 
[00:57:00]  Good.  How great would that be?  He's peddling the tape.  I'll bet you the attorney general and those guys are going after him because they asked  for him to do something and he said no.  Yeah.  They asked for him to release this kid.  It's disgusting that this kid's in jail and, oh good, how great is that?  I love when these prosecutors go to jail because they're not treated well.  No.  No.  There'll be a video of him in the shower.  Yes, Travis.  What makes the case even crazier is it wasn't sex.  It was oral sex.  Yes.  And if they had had sex, there's like a loophole in Georgia law that that would have been okay. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  But oral sex is not.  And wait, the kid was 17 and the girl was 15?  Both high school students, but it was completely consensual at a party.  It was like something that could happen to anybody at that age.  It's not like he lured some chick.  And everybody knows that this is just a dumb loophole of this poor guy who caught in.  He's been in jail for two years.  Look, they already started calling and writing in.  My sis is 15.  Her boyfriend is 20.  My mom is beyond cool with it.  What should I do about that one?  My girlfriend was 18 when I was 28, and that was a big age difference. 
[00:58:00]  Her parents hated me, but technically they couldn't do anything.  Oh, I've had a couple of pretty bad ones in my day early on.  You know, like when I was in my late teens, early 20s.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, no.  No, not like seven.  Don't go.  The worst I was was 20, just turned 14.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have a new hero. 
[00:58:30]  That was pretty bad.  Dude.  You 22 just turned.  Dude, first of all, let me tell you something.  Explain yourself.  Nothing.  Nothing like a 14-year-old.  Looks wise, everything.  I'll dig up a picture.  Believe me.  Nothing like that.  Looks wise, talk wise, everything.  She's a very wise girl.  Wise beyond her years.  Was she?  Did she have wisdom?  Wisdom beyond her years.  That would go well with the jury.  You don't get it.  She was smart.  You don't get it. 
[00:59:00]  And I was extremely immature for my age.  I was just like a goof.  What are the details?  Were you in California?  No.  Okay.  No.  It was, I don't know.  What are the statute of limitations on this?  Jesus Christ.  No, it's got to be.  It's a while.  It's a long time ago.  I don't want to implicate myself in anything I can be arrested for.  Why don't we just stop right there?  The hell is going on with this show today?  It wasn't that.  We got a relationship. 
[00:59:30]  We went out.  We went out for like a year.  Then she turned 15 and I was like, get out of here, you old hag.  Exactly.  As soon as she expressed a political opinion, out.  Do you, uh, I was 22.  I was out with a girl.  It was right before her 18th birthday.  Uh-huh.  She just was turning 18 and I'm like, it's a little young.  I'm 22 because she's still.  Yeah.  And then I found out that she was lying.  Ah.  And how old was she?  Um, well, uh, no, no, no, no. 
[01:00:00]  She was turning 18 and her father said like, uh, I figured out what her father said to her  one time, but it turns out she had, uh, she was just, uh, turning 16.  She lied by two years.  She lied by two years.  Two years.  Two pretty important years.  Biggies.  Let's say hi to Jeff and Kentucky.  I went to that sweet 16 party because I was going out with a girl that was 15 when I  was 20, uh, 21 and, and yeah. 
[01:00:30]  And, uh, I had, I had that long talk with her father as he drove me home about my intentions  and everything.  And then I went to her sweet 16 party and it wasn't going the way she wanted.  So she was like screaming and crying and I'm standing there going, maybe this isn't too  cool.  What were you doing?  Legally buying alcohol for everyone?  Yes, exactly.  Hey, let's go to Jeff and Kentucky.  Jeff.  I was a naughty boy.  You certainly were.  Jeff.  What's up? 
[01:01:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, let's go.  Hey, uh, when I met my wife, she was 16.  I was 24.  We've been together for 19 years now.  Worked out just fine.  God bless.  And how many kids?  Three.  Three.  Yeah.  I mean, now the phones are lit.  I mean, we can take calls like this all day now.  But the 17 and the 15 year old, that's, that is wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  All right.  Four guys in jail.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  We got to, uh, we got to, um, update Jimmy on what happened yesterday.  You know, uh, uh, Pat Duffy came to the table yesterday. 
[01:01:30]  Big time.  We got to explain that to everybody.  We, uh, we are celebrating Jimmy's thing.  Jimmy's birthday today.  Maybe.  Happy birthday.  Maybe a surprise or two.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  Oh, is there a surprise?  Ah, you never know.  I like the decorations.  You never know with this show.  I do like the decorations.  Yeah.  Maybe we got you a little something or we'll see.  I got a little surprise too yesterday.  Yeah?  I'll tell you when we come back.  All right.  Cool.  What a tease.  And Jason from Rye.  Opie, check out the Times crosswords.  16 across.  You'll enjoy it. 
[01:02:00]  I'll tell you when we come back to the Times crosswords.  You'll enjoy it.  Ooh.  Not another one.  They go good in cocoa.  Not with an M.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  Let's say hi to Kevin in New Rochelle.  Kevin, what's up today?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Yo, Anthony, your girlfriend might have been wise, but she didn't have wisdom teeth yet. 
[01:02:30]  Happy birthday, James.  That's not nice, sir.  And yes, happy birthday to old Jimmy Norton.  Your first surprise, Jimmy.  I have a surprise?  We got a few surprises for you today.  Can I say it for the record?  Yeah.  I love surprises.  Do you?  Especially on your birthday.  Do you?  There's been some.  I have it like, yes.  Last year, what did we get you?  Like an awful tranny with a cake.  Remember that?  Oh, God.  Remember that thing that came in?  That was, oh, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  And you guys took me.  It was great, though.  Huh?  It was like some blue bunny guy.  Oh, it was the blue bunny guy.  Oh, the blue bunny.  Yeah, the year before was the weird tranny guy.  That was when I was going to shoot Lucky Louie.  I had a tranny cake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that was a going away present.  I don't know.  I can't keep track of all this craziness that happens with you.  This really is nutty, the whole thing.  One year, it's a cake.  The next year, it's a cake.  Yeah, but it was a guy in a creepy blue bunny suit.  That's right.  I don't remember.  And he squeezed into it.  Everything was showing through the bunny suit. 
[01:03:30]  He was just a creep with a beard.  Remember that?  Sexuality was a bit different than the majority of the people.  I'll say.  Is that what you got me?  These guys got me the guy on the bike to take me.  I had the tiara.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you rode in, like, a rickshaw with a tiara on.  I still have that.  Not even there.  There it is.  Not even a tiara.  Oh, yeah.  It's his birthday hat.  It's a birthday hat.  A four-year-old.  A four-year-old girl would wear. 
[01:04:00]  What a dope I look like in that hat.  Kenny had the tiara on.  I just saw a picture of Kenny with the tiara on.  Here's your first surprise, Will Jimmy Norton.  Hi, Jim.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  I just want to wish you a very happy birthday and get out with the boys tonight.  I bet you can get a few drinks down your neck or whatever.  Have a great time.  I wish I was there to enjoy the fun with you, but we'll meet again soon.  Wow.  A happy birthday from Ozzy.  That's pretty cool.  How did you pull that off? 
[01:04:30]  Steve and the boys took care of that one, right?  Wow.  I did it.  By the way, that's a fresh one.  That wasn't from years ago.  That was recorded pretty much yesterday for you.  That was Roland, myself, the label guys, the prod guys here at K-Rock.  That was a succession of probably 35 emails trying to set that up.  My God.  I am impressed.  That is fantastic.  And we got the dirty version for later on this morning.  Oh, really?  You can take this home with you. 
[01:05:00]  He did a bunch.  Oh, great.  Oh, man.  That's fantastic.  That Ozzy's a good egg.  Oh, that's great.  Do we have another surprise?  I don't know.  You'll have to keep listening.  And Jimmy, you're just going to have to sit and wait.  Thank you.  I love it.  By the way, it is in the New York Times.  New York Times crossword, 16 across, talk radios, blank, and Anthony.  Son of a bitch.  Your name is always in it, though.  Oh, but I'm never the answer.  You're never going to be the answer with Anthony.  It's always Top Gun's blank Edwards. 
[01:05:30]  It's also his birthday today.  Sean Edwards?  No.  Anthony Edwards.  Anthony Edwards, right.  Why would it be blank Edwards for the Opie and blank Anthony?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony.  I've never seen a crossword where the answer is Anthony, by the way.  Why?  I don't know.  They need Opie for some reason because we replaced.  Is that like the key to a crossword puzzle?  Because we replaced Mayberry's kid or Mayberry kid and the answer would be Opie or there would  be some kind of Ron Howard in the clue and you had to write Opie. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And we have finally replaced that.  What is better, having your name in print or having the person have to write your name  in the crossword puzzle?  I see.  You're the answer to the puzzle, which is kind of cool.  I say they're both terrific.  Why are we competing with each other?  I don't give a crap.  Gosh, you're right.  Talk radio's blank.  I'm blank.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm blank.  But someone has to write you in.  People aren't even going to attempt to freaking answer that question. 
[01:06:30]  You think they'll do all the other ones and then it'll be like, oh, it's Opie.  Yeah, I never heard of those guys.  What is it, down or across?  16 across, today's New York Times crossword puzzle.  Talk radio's blanking Anthony.  So they'll do all the down words to get the letters.  I guess.  And it'll be O blank IE.  And they'll go, what?  Odie?  Oh, I'll just do this other one down and see what it comes out to.  But anyway, thanks for bringing that to our attention.  And I'm really, really sorry that it's taken an hour and a half to do this to everybody. 
[01:07:00]  He rocks making jokes.  What was the joke?  The answer's not Hitler.  Opie and blank.  I am not Hitler.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, great.  Enjoy, Jimmy, on your birthday.  Sorry, we're trying to get stuck in everyone's head. 
[01:07:30]  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain.  Chocolate rain.  A baby born will die before the sin.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  The school books say it can't be here again.  Chocolate rain.  The prisons make you wonder where it went.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  You like it, really? 
[01:08:00]  It has four minutes to go.  Tell me right now.  Do you like it or not?  It goes on and everything.  It doesn't change.  Do you really like it?  It doesn't change.  He keeps doing the same verse.  People are cursing us on instant feedback.  They said you guys definitely got this song stuck in my head yesterday.  Chocolate rain.  I woke up to this song this morning.  What is it?  What is chocolate rain?  What's he saying?  Exactly. 
[01:08:30]  No, no, Jimmy.  I haven't been able to figure it out and it's frustrating me.  We have no idea.  Chocolate rain.  Here you go.  Dave from Elmira.  Opie, you suck.  I woke up with this.  I woke up this morning.  My girlfriend said good morning to me.  I looked at her and said chocolate rain.  Rolling around my brain.  Chocolate rain.  And sometimes he makes his voice like that.  Once there was a girl who.  Chocolate rain.  Mm-hmm.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:09:00]  Only in the past is what they say.  Chocolate rain.  In the past is what they say.  With your neighborhood insurance rates.  Chocolate rain.  Makes us happy living in a gay chocolate rain.  Made me cross the street the other day.  Chocolate rain.  Made you turn your head the other way.  Chocolate rain.  It's very quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:09:30]  Still like it, Jimmy?  I do.  I really do.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  This was supposed to get to you today.  You're just too, you're just happy for you.  Yeah, it is.  You are a happy kid.  Matt, I had a great day last time.  How can you not be through?  Ozzy wished me a happy birthday.  How can I not?  Oh, that's why.  Okay, you can't get past that.  Oh, how could you?  What's there to get past?  That's it.  It's fantastic.  Chocolate rain is driving everybody insane.  I'm monster rain.  Oh, we went through that yesterday. 
[01:10:00]  We were having so much fun.  We went through every rhyme of rain.  Because chocolate rain could also describe something else.  Yes, it's true.  Bad sushi equals chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  That's where we're going.  My abdomen is in such utter pain.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  I eat everything quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:10:30]  Using you to fall back down again.  Do you know what it means, Jimmy?  Are you getting any message from this?  No, I didn't think so.  There's something here, though.  He's saying something.  It's kind of interesting.  It's the song for the revolution.  Is it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it a black militant type song?  Or is it a black memory song?  Well, if we're going to get serious for a moment, that's what I'm thinking. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's one of those types of things.  The school books say it can't be hearing.  The prisons make you wonder where it went.  He's thinking about something.  Is chocolate rain like, does you mean rain like the rain of black people?  Yeah.  And then it was destroyed by white people.  What?  Like the rain.  Like to rain over something.  Not rain like sprinkle rain.  Right.  But to rain like chocolate rain. 
[01:11:30]  Like they rained as kings and queens.  So it's not R-A-I-N.  It's R-E-I-G-N.  Right.  Gotcha.  And maybe he's talking about that and how that was destroyed by the white man.  Yeah.  Interesting.  Build a tent and say the world is dry.  Chocolate rain.  Jimmy's into it.  How could you not be?  I know.  It's taken over the world.  Zoom the camera out and see the lie. 
[01:12:00]  I'm guessing it has something to do with race.  Yeah.  Wow.  The chocolate rain could just be-  Voss said it might be heroin.  What a-  No, Voss is an idiot.  Dummy he is.  Voss is an idiot.  He probably thinks it means there's a lake made of chocolate and now it's raining.  It's raining chocolate.  Could chocolate rain have nothing to do with race?  It could just be a sweetening of something.  I don't know.  I think chocolate though is the representation of the black man. 
[01:12:30]  Maybe.  Like, you know, Chocolate City.  They called New Orleans that.  They have a black comedy night at the Laugh Factory in L.A. on Sundays.  They call it Chocolate Sunday.  See?  That's why I'm thinking chocolate rain might mean something like that.  But I can't figure out what the hell he's talking about.  Hey, it's a young fella too.  I thought it would be like an older guy.  A young fella?  Yeah, look.  Is that him?  That's him.  He looked like Erkel.  It's Tay Zonday.  Great voice.  T-A-Y-Z-O-N-D-A-Y. 
[01:13:00]  If you want to throw that in YouTube.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  What's he talking about?  I like the Casio.  Turned on the radio.  Chocolate rain.  It's the fear your leader's car control.  Chocolate rain.  Worse than swearing.  Worse than calling names.  Chocolate rain.  Wow.  Worse than swearing.  Say it publicly and you're insane.  Chocolate rain.  No one wants to hear about it now. 
[01:13:30]  Chocolate rain.  I think he doesn't know what he's talking about.  What?  He's just throwing blinds in there.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  I love chocolate rain.  He's like half retard, I think.  And he's just like making stuff up and we're trying to interpret it like idiots.  He just came up with like, chocolate rain.  Oh, that sounds interesting.  Let me just throw some gibberish in here.  Then go, chocolate rain.  Kristen from Rye knows what chocolate rain's about.  Oh, let's see.  Chocolate rain.  Kristen.  Kristen. 
[01:14:00]  What is chocolate rain?  Okay, obviously there's something.  Okay, obviously there's something.  Okay, obviously there's something.  Okay, obviously there's something.  Basically, it's got to be a metaphor for being African American because if you listen  to two specific lines, there's a part about being the month, taking over the month  of February, which is Black History Month.  I'm looking at that right now.  You're right.  And then there's the other one where he talks about your rates going up when they're your  neighbors, but then there's like a bunch of other ones.  It's obvious it's got to be about that.  Does it have anything to do with black people being sad or tearing like rain, chocolate rain,  like crying? 
[01:14:30]  Because that's, she's right.  Because here it says, every February washed away.  Almost like, all right, it washes away all the sin and all the bad things.  Washed away, yeah.  Like February washes away all the sins of the country.  And then, and there's something about, in the beginning here, a, all right, guys, thanks  a lot.  Rain is washing away.  Has it all to do with black people crying?  Yeah, let's go to Jesse in Jersey.  Jesse!  It's fine, but just to, since you've got a little lipstick on here. 
[01:15:00]  Hey there, Jesse.  Rick, that's the one.  This one?  Thank you.  I'm hanging, I'm hanging.  Jess.  Jess.  Yeah.  Hey.  That was hilarious, guys.  That was great.  Who are you talking to?  You?  No, you were talking to some girl about lipstick.  Oh, oh, the girl on the lipstick, yeah.  I'm at work, and she's like, you know, asking me some questions or whatever, and I just told  her, dude, you've got some lipstick right on your teeth, and I can't even look at you.  I don't know, she's a co-worker. 
[01:15:30]  Did you guys, did you guys hear the line that I wanted to add to the song?  No, no.  Rachel.  Chocolate rain, diarrhea pouring out again.  Why are you alive?  Oh, Jesus.  Couldn't wait to call with that one, man.  Body goes away somehow, chocolate rain.  Makes the best of friends begin to fight chocolate rain.  But did they know each other in the light chocolate rain? 
[01:16:00]  Every February washed away chocolate rain.  Oh, that's the every February washed away line.  February washed away chocolate rain.  Aaron from his cell phone, this is a better line.  Chocolate rain.  Man, I shouldn't have worn a skirt today.  Chocolate rain.  Yeah, for some reason or another, you sound a little taller on radio.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:16:30]  Stays behind his colors, celebrate chocolate rain.  The same crime has a higher price to pay.  Chocolate rain.  Yeah, it's a blackout thing.  And the next thing is the judge.  The same crime has a higher price to pay.  And the next line.  Blacks get more time for the same crimes that white people.  This is great, actually.  I don't know how anybody, this is really.  You like that?  I really do, yeah.  Thanks for blowing up the bit, man.  We just want to get it stuck in people's heads.  We'll burn it for you for your birthday. 
[01:17:00]  I actually would like it, yeah.  Put it on your iPod.  Dirty secrets of economy.  I don't know what this means.  And then he goes, dirty secrets of economy.  Chocolate rain.  That's all we're trying to do is get that part stuck in people's heads.  Chocolate rain.  Turns that body into GDP.  I don't know what GDP means.  Gross domestic product.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Turns that body.  That's what our economy is based on, right?  The bell curve he talks about?  Yes. 
[01:17:30]  What?  Lit rain.  It's really quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  It's really quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  I got to be honest.  Chocolate. 
[01:18:00]  Ah.  No, I got to be honest.  I'm starting to dig the song, man.  It's good, man.  It's kind of.  Yesterday, I thought it was this kind of silly goof song, you know, just kind of thrown  together.  And now it's like, it's catchy.  Yeah.  It's kind of deep.  The guy's trying to sing something with his lyrics.  I think it's so shallow that you can't even figure out what the hell it means.  No, I like, when you talk about the economy and things like that.  No, I like that, man.  It's kind of, we're all, not just what it is.  All right, great.  Sure, book him.  Go ahead.  Get him on the show.  Perform it live. 
[01:18:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  With his Casio MIDI.  Yeah, but listen a little further.  Do we have to?  Oh.  Dirty secrets of economy.  Chocolate rain.  Dirty secrets of economy.  He turns that body into GDP.  Chocolate rain.  The Belker blames the baby's DNA.  Chocolate rain.  But his scores are how much the parents make chocolate rain. 
[01:19:00]  Flipping cars in France the other night.  Chocolate rain.  What?  Flipping cars in France the other night.  What's that about?  All right, so I don't know.  All right, now we got to get into this song.  Obviously, there was some kind of riots in France.  All right.  Right, yes, when blacks were rioting in France.  Flipping cars in France to everyone.  But then again, could it be about the Muslims in France that were rioting, which was very recent.  They were rioting in France and burning. 
[01:19:30]  So maybe it's not just about blacks.  Maybe it's about all groups that have been.  Maybe it's just all about oppression in general as opposed to being specifically targeted for blacks.  I don't know if there's anything in here with the American Indians.  Yeah, this guy's definitely very talented.  He's saying a lot with his lyrics.  Yeah, I like that.  Top.  What?  He is.  I said yes.  Cleans the sewers out beneath Mumbai, chocolate rain.  Mumbai, what?  You gotta love that.  Cross the world and back, it's all the same.  Chocolate rain.  Angels cry and shake their heads in shame. 
[01:20:00]  Chocolate rain.  Luke's the arc of paradise and it's in chocolate rain.  Huh?  Which part do you think you're living in chocolate rain?  More than marching, more than passing law.  Chocolate rain.  Wow, I hope he's going to town.  Remake how we got to where we are.  Chocolate rain.  History quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, it's being pointed out in Instant Feedback.  This guy's saying a lot more than Reverend Al ever did.  I guess so.  He certainly is.  Maybe that's what happened to Al Sweat.  Man, a lot of people are pointing that out today on the Instant Feedback.  Hey, make fun of this guy, but he's saying a hell of a lot more.  That's very funny, Jeremy.  No, but it...  I was just in the middle of a sentence.  I couldn't stop.  I couldn't stop like Kenny stopped this morning.  Sorry.  The airbags would have been...  Anyway, that's what's... 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, they're saying that on Instant Feedback, man.  He's saying a hell of a lot more than stupid Reverend Al.  I like this, man.  This is a...  Using you to bottle bag.  Thank God you weren't here yesterday, because we had fun just goofing on this and getting  this stuck in everyone's head, and now you're taking the serious angle.  I'm sorry.  Which is...  No, it's fine.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Green.  He made so many doody jokes with this song.  I can't even tell you yesterday.  It was just all doody jokes.  We made you proud yesterday, that's for sure.  And now today we're taking the other angle, I guess.  Monster rain.  Oh, we did the monster rain. 
[01:21:30]  Pain was used a lot.  Oh, beneath the porch again, chocolate rain.  I want to know what this means.  Down again, chocolate rain.  It's really quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  Great music.  One of the only songs I could actually sing. 
[01:22:00]  Chocolate rain.  It's really great.  It's not catchy though, man.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall.  It's weird.  I don't know what it means.  I like a song like that, though.  I think he's babbling.  But this is the important phone call right here.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You know, I just, I have to tell you that you just ruined my whole day with that song.  With chocolate rain.  I put you guys on the radio when I get up.  I go in, you know, I'm getting ready for work. 
[01:22:30]  I jump in the shower.  I'm going to start the day off right and rub one out.  And that song comes on and just totally broke my concentration.  Sorry.  Ruined everything.  Chocolate rain.  Well, dude, what you don't seem to get is the school books says it can't be here again.  Yeah.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Give me a like that part, too.  I don't do you not.  If Tom is ever yelling at me, no matter what he's saying, I'm just going to go, chocolate  rain.  You get out of any argument by just looking at the person going, chocolate rain. 
[01:23:00]  Look, we can't have that.  The Lord.  Chocolate rain.  I'm going to start snapping and dance his way out of the room.  All right.  We got to take another break.  Sure.  We'll do that.  Take another break again.  Chocolate rain.  Look, E-Rock was late again.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Maybe another surprise. 
[01:23:30]  A little.  Kenny's hair.  It looks like tumbleweed.  Chocolate rain.  I didn't realize he was walking in as I said that.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Right.  Enough.  Chocolate rain.  Well, he doesn't seem like a very fun guy to hang out with, though.  No.  Chocolate rain.  What would you like to eat?  Chocolate sundae.  All right.  How about just something else?  Chocolate rain.  Big boy took a duty again. 
[01:24:00]  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  Why are you grabbing your umbrella?  Looks like rain.  All right.  No, he watches.  That's his favorite Honeymooners episode.  It looks like rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Ralph from Belleville.  Very good.  All right.  Everyone's coming up with their own lyrics to Chugged It Rain.  I imagine most of them are not particularly...  Notice I haven't read any, Jimmy.  You know, it always has to go there.  Talking about Knicks games and...  We'll dig that word up from the ground again. 
[01:24:30]  Fuck it rain.  Exactly.  It always has to go there.  It's right.  You know.  Maybe we could be just a little bit clever.  No.  Just a little bit.  Instead of going for the real obvious one.  We could stay with the duty for a while.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's hard to say duty is the clever angle.  True.  Good point.  Good point.  Chugged It Rain.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Chugged It Rain.  This is a good song.  Speaking of duty, you know, we got to let the audience know what happened yesterday. 
[01:25:00]  I don't know how, but...  I think we should be able to play that audio, to be quite honest with you.  Good luck to you.  Really?  Yeah.  We shouldn't even try?  I don't think it'll fly.  We got into some weird duty war with Ron and Fez.  And let's be honest here.  They drew first blood.  They drew first blood.  Yeah.  And we ended the competition big time yesterday.  Yeah.  They backed out.  They're out.  They're out of duty wars.  It's done.  So we have a winner. 
[01:25:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we'll tell you what Pat Duffy did yesterday to end duty wars.  Okay.  We didn't start it.  I know.  Because now we're being looked at like we're into the duty thing.  No, I just mean it might be hard to describe.  But we'll do our best.  Did they dump out earlier when I mentioned?  No.  So we're good.  Yeah.  We're good.  Oh, party favors.  But they don't go...  I know.  Who gets silent party favors?  Where'd you get these?  The party favors for... 
[01:26:00]  This is like a party's for deaf people.  Yeah.  It's all colors and no noise.  Yeah.  What?  What?  Maybe Tom got them because he didn't want them to be that much fun.  Just a little bit of fun.  I don't know.  I don't look at the boys that way.  I'm grateful we have a job.  Tom didn't even know it was his birthday.  He did.  He came in and he said, is it your birthday today?  Well, because he was listening to the radio.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Tom has my birthday in his BlackBerry. 
[01:26:30]  Chocolate rain.  All right.  We're going to attempt to tell everyone what Pat Duffy did yesterday.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Enough about the chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Add it.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  We got to take a break.  Take a break.  Yeah.  We have some bills to pay.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Hey, someone is saying you must, in big letters with asterisks, all that fun stuff. 
[01:27:00]  On the instant feedback, it's Dustin from Cleveland.  You must play the chocolate rain remix.  200% more annoying than the original.  Yes.  More chocolate rain.  All the way on ONA.  Chocolate rain.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on little Jimmy Norton's birthday.  We're hoping we get another surprise in for you, Jimmy.  Also, thank you to the Brooklyn Diner here in New York City, down the street on 57th 
[01:27:30]  and 7th for supplying breakfast for everybody today.  That's very, very cool of them.  Shoveling it in nonstop since they got here.  The French toast is amazing, and they have the best fruit in the city.  Yeah, we've been eating at the Brooklyn Diner for, I don't even know, eight or nine years  at this point.  Oh, years.  Years and years and years.  So, Duty Wars is officially over, right?  They raised the white flag over at the Ron and Fez camp yesterday?  I guess so.  That's what I'm hearing.  There will be no retaliation.  Let's just remember who drew first blood. 
[01:28:00]  We didn't want this war, but we decided we will finish it.  And we finished it yesterday in style.  I don't even know where to begin with this whole damn thing.  As a goof, we started making big boy made of duty videos, and pretty hard to explain  on this side of the show, but just imagine.  It was pretty bad.  And then the follow-up video was an actual duty hat.  Duty hat.  And that's all you have to say.  You know, use your imagination, okay?  You need to use your imagination if you're going to listen to this show. 
[01:28:30]  And we were using Cream Puff.  Mm-hmm.  Cream Pie.  Come on.  Whatever he is.  They call him Cream Puff.  We call him Cream Pie Jones.  He impressed us to the point where we were getting a little cocky.  And then Ron and Fez had their guy, Eastside Dave, just completely lose his mind because  he didn't want to lose in any type of stunt boy competition.  Yeah.  And look, we were just goofing and making these silly duty videos.  Let's just put it at that.  Uh-huh.  And then Eastside Dave decided, oh, yeah, and he just took it to a place that I don't 
[01:29:00]  think anyone really wanted to go.  He took it to a level.  Because yesterday on the Ron and Fez show, they're kind of talking down to us a little  bit.  Yeah.  Saying that's what we're about and stuff.  Not really.  Not really.  Eastside Dave brought it to the sick level.  Yeah.  Where the hospital was involved and the Board of Health.  Yeah.  And, you know, we didn't want to go there.  We were just minding our own business doing silly radio for everybody. 
[01:29:30]  Uh-huh.  Some people liked it.  A bunch of people hated it.  But?  But yesterday on the Ron and Fez show, they were kind of talking down to us and like,  ugh, that's what they're all about.  We're not about this.  I'm like, your guy started this or brought it to the next level.  You know, they threw the challenge out there.  Eastside Dave versus Cream Pie Jones.  We knew we were in over our head and we were in trouble because Eastside Dave is out of  his mind.  He's done some crazy things.  Yeah.  He's unstoppable.  It's not the first time he's been in the hospital for doing kind of stunt boy radio stuff,  right? 
[01:30:00]  He'll do anything.  He'll eat anything.  He's a madman.  Jay Moore, who used to be a fan of our show, and he's one of many that is now a fan of the  Ron and Fez show instead.  Instead, he came in, did something with hot sauce and Eastside Dave, and it burned so  bad, use your imagination, that he had to go to the hospital.  Go to the hospital.  So we knew we were dealing with a true champion.  Champion.  And we were going to just leave the whole duty war thing alone. 
[01:30:30]  Dave did what he did on his show and ended up in the hospital, and we were just going  to leave it at that for the most part.  But just in case, we had a little surprise just waiting in the wings.  And then Eastside Dave, Jimmy, you don't know this, and Fez just barged into our show yesterday.  Just barged in.  Fez, he dressed like he's going to the gay pride parade.  He had his Fez on and his big colorful jacket.  Yeah.  And Eastside Dave had no shirt on.  And a collar and a leash. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And Fez let him in on a leash.  And he was insane.  He was barking and yelling at everybody, saying that he was the champ.  Yeah.  And then we had to take Cream Pie there.  Cream Pie Jones out of the mix.  Out of the mix.  And we had Pat Duffy in the bullpen the whole time.  Yeah, warm it up.  You know, the star of the Baby Bird video that everyone knows and loves.  And, you know, that video is just being passed all over the world at this point.  So we brought him up from the minors.  And, wow, did he just, oh, knocked it out of the park. 
[01:31:30]  And unbeknownst to us, we didn't know what Pat Duffy had up his sleeve.  We kind of told Pat Duffy, you might want to prepare something just in case.  You always want to be prepared, right?  Yeah.  And sure enough, Fez and Eastside Dave just walked into a right hook yesterday, ranting and raving.  And we brought Pat Duffy into the mix.  And basically, he, he, he.  Wait, can we ask you a question?  Before you get, does your girlfriend know you did this?  She, she was, she kissed him after he was done. 
[01:32:00]  She was in the room and kissed him.  She watched it go down and they kind of made out a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Let's see.  So, Pat Duffy presented a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a thing.  It's, let's just say, when you feed.  Give me a thumbs up or down there, E.  When, when, when, when, uh, you, you feed your dog. 
[01:32:30]  That's all you have to say.  Uh.  I, I think the audience is smart.  Right, right.  When you feed your dog.  Wait.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh, geez.  That's even more than I would do.  Wow.  Al said we could say this.  Yeah, but that's.  Hey, I like how Al's helping us out now with this instead of making us skirt around crap  for, uh, for 20 minutes.  Uh, Al writes down the hall, Pat took something that your dog might leave in the backyard. 
[01:33:00]  And he used it in place of, we, we could say this.  Very good.  And he used it in place of toothpaste.  That's what he did.  Yeah.  To just put an end to duty wars.  Wait a minute.  Okay, so, if you had Pat Duffy's toothpaste on your shoe, somebody would say, don't walk  on the rug.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's explained, Jimmy.  Everyone knows.  We're good.  That's it.  We're good.  No, I know, but I'm enjoying it.  All right.  So what made it even better?  First of all, we weren't happy with what, uh, Pat brought in, so we said, you know, you 
[01:33:30]  gotta make it into a nice paste.  Yeah.  Well, everything has to be in paste form if you're gonna use it as toothpaste.  Right.  So, uh.  And this was right in front of Eastside Dave and Fez.  Oh, boy, did we, we bring it yesterday.  And then, to make it even better, and I, I swear, I, I, this came out of left field.  E-Rock, all excited, pulls out his toothbrush that he used yesterday morning.  And we all know the problems E-Rock has.  And was the toothbrush applauding the new application? 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, the toothbrush is like, finally, something minty.  Sorry.  And someone is calling me a spin doctor.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We have videos to prove it.  We shut down duty wars yesterday.  And then Pat Duffy proceeded, not, not to just kind of go through the motions, but, man,  an all-out brushing.  Molars.  An all-out brushing, Jimmy.  Wisdom teeth. 
[01:34:30]  An all-out brushing.  Is that on, is that on all the, uh.  We got a video of this yet?  Who knows?  Anyone?  Who knows where it can be posted?  Anywhere.  It doesn't, it can say what it is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Say he's brushing with, uh, I won't say that.  It doesn't get chocolate red.  An all-out brushing.  Eastside Dave was foaming at the mouth.  What?  What's up, Sam?  You got a video, though.  Yeah, I have a video.  It'll be on, uh, our website this afternoon.  Good.  Hey.  Now, while we're, uh, while, uh, Sam is here. 
[01:35:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  But before that, can I ask something?  Is this video worth playing in Mansfield on Saturday night?  Absolutely.  Yeah, make sure we have a copy of this.  Absolutely.  Sam, that's your job.  We need a video of this.  When Ant and I are on that stage doing the comedy show, we will show this video in, uh,  in Mansfield Saturday night when we do the ONAE traveling virus comedy show.  We've been looking for a new video to, to present to everybody.  Is that what you're previewing it?  So, you know what, uh, well, I mean, uh, for the hardcore fans, let them find it.  That's fine.  And then, uh, that'll be the, uh, the public, uh, the first public screening of this video. 
[01:35:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Uh, I was just going to say when, when, while Sam is here, uh, we all know he, he eats the  exact same things that an eight year old eats.  Right.  Um, why don't we do our little segment, Sam, what did you have for dinner?  Well, last night I ate at my parents' house.  Oh.  So my mom made, uh, some of her fried chicken for me, uh, which isn't that bad. 
[01:36:00]  No.  But, she made a few extra chicken fingers so I could bring them in for breakfast this morning,  which is what I ate for breakfast.  Chicken fingers.  And did mommy give you a dessert?  Oh, wait, before the dessert, and you washed it down with a big glass of...  Uh, whole milk.  Yeah, of course.  Yes, milk.  He loves his milk.  He loves his milk no matter what it's mixed with.  And, uh...  Very disturbing.  Dessert.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was about to say I didn't have any, but then I remembered I had a couple of baby Twix's. 
[01:36:30]  He eats the same food an eight-year-old eats.  Forgot about the Twix's.  Baby Twix's.  Well, mini Twix's, I should have said.  Yeah, of course.  A couple of those.  Mini baby.  Just sitting there, shoving him in his mouth.  Whatever, yeah.  Did you have chocolate all around your mouth?  Chocolate green.  You look like Pat Duffy after that meal.  Chocolate green.  By the way, you could join Sam in San Diego.  Wow.  Courtesy of our good friends at NBC, we're talking about Comic-Con in San Diego. 
[01:37:00]  You'll get a sneak peek at NBC's new fall shows by Nick Worman and Chuck and see the  cast and crew of Heroes, talk about their new season and see the latest sci-fi screenings.  Log on to 923krock.com to enter to win this trip to go to San Diego with our own Sam.  Wow.  Sharing a hotel room with a...  Probably not, but it may be a joining room or something.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  So, Pat Duffy did that yesterday.  And we're going to play the video at the comedy show this Saturday in Mansfield. 
[01:37:30]  Don't forget, if you've got a military ID, you get in free this Saturday when we take  the show to Mansfield.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  There you go.  We've been looking for a new video.  This thing is going to...  Oh, my God.  It's going to gross out a lot of people.  And we officially claim victory.  Duty Wars is over.  Ronnie put a stop to it yesterday.  Ronnie knew that his guys just couldn't come up with anything better than that.  You know, I mean, Eastside Day was trying to do the, quote, Greg Leganus. 
[01:38:00]  But he, you know, even Ronnie saw how hacked that was and said, look, Duty Wars over.  Opie and Anthony win.  He didn't want to, like, come out and officially say that.  But you could just...  You could hear it in his...  You could hear it in his...  You could hear it in his tone yesterday.  The defeat was there.  Yeah.  So it's over.  You're the champion over there, Pat.  And the brilliance of us, by the way.  Eastside Dave was just foaming at the mouth.  He had the collar and the chain.  And Fezzy was holding him back.  Oh, yeah.  He knew that Pat Duffy did something pretty amazing yesterday.  He wanted to try to beat that yesterday on our show. 
[01:38:30]  And we wouldn't allow it.  We said, do it on your show, pal.  Do it on your own show.  And now he can't.  No, he can't.  That's great.  You don't need to get on this show.  Dave is a complete psychopath.  A lunatic.  But it was some pretty sick radio.  Yes.  Hey, I'll admit it.  We're not proud of it.  But look, we didn't draw first blood, like we said.  We didn't draw first blood.  We didn't draw first blood, but we decided we'll end this thing. 
[01:39:00]  It's time.  Nothing's over.  In duty wars.  You're going to send in a lot of men.  I'll suggest one thing.  What's that?  A lot of chocolate ring.  How's the remix, Danny?  I'm never going to stop.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I can't wait to start dancing.  Is it bad?  They said this is even worse than the original.  Really?  Well, because there's a pretty decent techno beat behind it with some obnoxious keyboards.  Yeah.  As if the original wasn't obnoxious.  Wasn't bad enough, for sure.  Yeah.  Let's bring this back. 
[01:39:30]  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  Rain.  You know, we're listening to the beginning of a phenomenon.  You're going to hear a million versions of this dumb thing.  Who's doing this?  The artist wasn't listed.  It was just simply up as an anonymous.  Yeah, this is a hack version. 
[01:40:00]  Thanks.  You could guitar hero to that?  Yeah, we could probably do that.  That's rough.  We'll cut our losses on that one.  Very good.  All right.  Anthony, tornadoes flooding on Long Island.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of weird.  I mean, the big news today here in New York, we had a steam pipe burst.  It shot steam 30 stories into the sky.  One guy's dead.  Perhaps higher than that.  Even higher than 30 stories?  They said it was going up to the top of the Chrysler building. 
[01:40:30]  Wow.  And we had someone on the line.  They had to go to work.  But they said the steam, as hot as 900 degrees.  Is that possible?  Well, I think that's how hot steam is in the pipes, probably.  It's even hotter.  I read in the paper 400 and something degrees.  But now this guy's saying 900 degrees.  One guy dead.  One guy...  You're kidding.  Supposedly the guy in the tow truck that's on the front page of the paper, he's in a medically induced coma, burnt over 80% of his body.  Like our own E-Rock. 
[01:41:00]  His head just shakes.  Yeah, his head just shakes back and forth when you say something bad about him.  And what's kind of strange, and this happens from time to time with our radio show, yesterday Ant and I were talking about Category 5 hurricanes because the news decided...  The news needed something like this.  They weren't getting a great story, so they decided out of nowhere to get an expert to talk about Category 5 hurricanes hitting New York, which is completely ridiculous.  Is it possible?  Sure.  All right, fine.  But, I mean, the odds are so ridiculous.  The water's too cold up here. 
[01:41:30]  It's not worth talking about and scaring the crap out of people that live in this area.  And we were joking about that.  And I said, look, what we are scared about is manhole covers exploding.  Oh.  And Category 5 hurricane, that's way down on our list of things we're worrying about on a regular basis.  An earthquake possibly destroying New York City, way down on the list.  Lock this monster in the Hudson River, way down on our list.  We worry about dumb stuff like the manhole covers popping up and clunking you. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Getting electrocuted by...  There you go.  Wow, see?  The manhole covers popping up.  This isn't the first time, and, you know.  My favorite part of that was listening to dumb Voss trying to get in.  Trying to get in.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  We...  Like a retarded duck.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  We were like Club Soda Kenny stopping her car yesterday, man.  We would just, like, just stop him in his tracks and move on to something else.  We would start to try to say something.  Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:42:30]  And then we would just talk right over.  What he does, what Dummy does is he shakes his, like, his hands, his arms stiffly shake  because they have no bendability, and his head moves.  He just looks like a confused idiot, which he is.  Yeah.  It's a perfectly accurate name.  Of course.  Chocolate rain.  The Dummy's trying to be poignant again.  Chocolate rain.  But the other part of that story from yesterday, we were kind of joking about the whole weather  thing, like, we're never bothered by weather for the most part, and a tornado touches  down on Long Island yesterday.  We were talking about, ah, no big weather phenomenons happen in New York that really do that much 
[01:43:00]  damage or anything, and a tornado touches down.  It was an F1.  F1.  Not that, you know, powerful, but you get winds into the 100 miles an hour range, and  the news was all over it.  All over it.  Tornado.  They had to get all the news vans there and their reporters there.  Was this before the steam pipe?  Yes.  So they thought they could use this to scare people a little bit, right?  Yeah.  This was the big story, because the big rainstorms we had here in New York and out on Long Island 
[01:43:30]  were just ridiculous.  Wound up screwing up my basement a little bit.  I was very upset about that.  You know what happened?  Huh?  You know those basement windows?  When you have a basement window, they put the little, like, half-moon well around it.  Yeah.  So it's about three feet down.  Yeah, the window's below the ground.  It's below the ground.  Technically, right?  It's a big metal well.  Yeah, we got it.  And then there's drainage at the bottom of it. 
[01:44:00]  Well, apparently, that was kind of full of leaves.  A little bit of leaves.  It would have drained during a normal rainstorm, but this was just ridiculous.  So it rained to the point where that well completely filled up.  It's three feet high on the window and an additional two feet under the window.  It's about five feet high.  There was five feet of water against one of my basement windows.  It looked like you were in a submarine.  Oh, wow.  It was, I just wanted to throw fish in there and make it a fish tank. 
[01:44:30]  It was that, it looked like that.  I thought it flooded the basement, though.  No.  All of a sudden, the window cracked.  Oh, okay.  It started cracking, but it's a dual-paned window, and the inside window cracked, which  is odd, because the water was pushing against the outside pane of the window.  And when that happened, the alarm went off.  So during the end of the show, if you noticed me texting like crazy here, I get a text from  my girlfriend going, the alarm just went off.  Oh, you said yesterday that the basement was flooding. 
[01:45:00]  No, well, it was.  But this was like, at first, she just said the alarm went off.  And I text back, grab the gun.  That's my first response.  When that alarm goes off, take up a defensive position.  That's what I told her.  She was trying to fend off the water, so she shot through the window.  Right, and broke it.  Keep that water at bay.  Just type in, grab the gun.  And then she gets the call from the alarm company, and they work things out, you know, 
[01:45:30]  make sure it's not an emergency, and puts the gun away.  And then goes downstairs in the basement and notices that the window's cracked and water's  leaking in the basement now.  So she had to grab a bunch of stuff to try to combat the water from coming into the basement.  And then when I got home, there was still water in the basement.  So I noticed a big box of diapers that are in the basement from when my girlfriend's sister 
[01:46:00]  visits with the children.  So I'm just tearing diapers open and throwing them all over my basement.  It looks great down there now.  It looks like the Gacy house or something.  It's just an awful...  You've got to get a picture of that.  But I've got to tell you, those things do soak up some water, man.  Wow.  They get all big and fat, full of water, where it's supposed to be like, you know, those  babies can go a lot, I guess.  So they make them so they really soak it up.  So now everywhere there was a puddle, there's just ripped open diapers thrown all over the 
[01:46:30]  place.  But it worked very well.  And then I called up the builder and he's got to replace my window.  But that was my, the extent of my damage.  But they had a tornado in East Islip.  And this weather guy was out there and he's talking about tornadoes and what they can do.  And then they go back to the anchor guy and he goes, did you notice any, because I heard  this about tornadoes, any twisting of trees, tree trunks?  And I'm sitting there going, this guy's just talking about, you know, someone's shed blew 
[01:47:00]  away, a fence blew off.  Do you know what kind of tornado it takes to twist a tree trunk?  That would be like, what?  An F2?  Actually an F4.  I thought you were going to say F5.  And then we could have all just dramatically looked at each other and someone could have  gone, what's that?  And then I would just go, finger of God.  And we could all just look around. 
[01:47:30]  What's, what's an F5?  Oh, she didn't say that.  Oh Jesus, she didn't say F5.  Finger of God.  Oh, Twister is the worst movie ever made.  I've never seen it.  Oh, it's horrid.  Oh, please go.  No, you got to watch the movie, Jimmy.  Watch it and vomit.  It's a terrific movie.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Sounds like a train coming.  Oh, does it at least have a happy ending?  Yeah, they all die.  Oh, good.  Very happy.  And the weatherman even said, he goes, no, that you'd see more with an F3 or F4. 
[01:48:00]  Right, right.  Of the twisting tree trunk.  But we did see some twisted signs.  And the anchorman went, ah, yes, see, that's what I was, you know.  All right, let's go with this.  Twisting signs.  Yeah, let's get some fear out of that statement.  Yeah.  Twisting signs.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's in danger.  I think Long Island's getting a tornado that is going to be twisting trees.  Is the clip worth playing or not, really?  Oh, you can hear what an idiot he is.  Here we go.  You can see the brush here. 
[01:48:30]  This was a fence blowing in this direction.  You can see that was the fence.  I'm going to come up.  Jim's right.  Kansas is laughing at this.  Wind coming in this direction.  Took that fence and stabled it right against the trees here.  At the same time, note the brush blowing again in one distinct direction, showing us winds blowing in one direction.  But the other key is we look up here.  And, Jim, you can see the trees bending in the different direction, showing, indeed, we did have a rotation.  And it was confirmed earlier this afternoon, an EF1 tornado touching down an ice up on the corner of Irish Lane and Sunrise Highway, with winds between 85 and 110 miles an hour. 
[01:49:00]  John, one quick question for you, John.  I know when I've been out chasing –  And this is the job of the anchor, by the way, you know, just a basic report, a tornado hits down in Long Island, which is kind of rare, because I know we're talking to a lot of people around America that what's the big deal.  For Long Island, it's a big deal, because it just doesn't happen that often.  Yeah.  And that's the story right there.  It just doesn't happen that often.  But, of course, the anchor's job now is to try to get more out of nothing.  And he talks about chasing storms. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  Like he's a storm chaser, but he doesn't know an F1 isn't going to twist tree trunks.  Yeah.  Question for you, John.  I know when I've been out chasing storms before, sometimes after a tornado, you'll actually see a –  Isn't that Ernie Anastas?  No.  He's a storm chaser.  Extreme, man.  This is awesome.  Let's go.  We're getting rotation.  I hear there's a cold front coming in, man.  Go on.  Get the van.  Get the van.  Play the music.  This is extreme.  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:00]  Dude, it is the worst movie you will ever see.  Honestly.  I've been out chasing storms before.  Sometimes after a tornado, you'll actually see a trunk of a tree that's been twisted.  Did you see anything like that?  No.  No.  The tornado probably that you're looking at may be even an F2, perhaps even an F3 tornado, most likely an F2.  But we did see, Lonnie, some twisted signs showing some rotation.  So, yes, we did find some of the twisting with the winds in the signs.  Not the tree trunks.  That would be stronger, but the signs indicating an F1. 
[01:50:30]  I'm my colleague, John Blair.  Thank you, John, very much.  It looks like, yes, we did see some twisting.  Right, right.  Yeah.  What, tinfoil?  Yes.  No, it was a chubby checker.  I was standing there.  There's the line.  Oh, it asses.  Yeah.  It so happens chubby checker was performing locally.  So, yeah, we did see some twisting.  They were so cool in Twister.  They would play rock music as they're chasing the storm and sing to it and, like, yell, like, 
[01:51:00]  yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're getting rotation.  I can't even wrap my...  Debris.  We have debris.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  We got the drop?  Yeah.  What?  Here it is.  Listen to this, Jimmy.  No, that was a good-sized Twister.  What was that?  An F3?  Solid F2.  See, now you've lost me again.  It's the Fujita scale.  It measures the intensity of a tornado by how much it eats.  Eats?  Destroys.  A little encounter me back there is a strong F2, F3, maybe. 
[01:51:30]  Maybe we see some F4s today.  That'd be sweet.  F4 is good.  F4 will relocate your house fairly efficiently.  Is there an F5?  What would that be like?  The finger of God.  None of you have ever seen an F5?  Just one of us. 
[01:52:00]  Just one of us.  Why are you bringing this up?  He drops.  You hear the silverware kind of drop.  I'm trying to forget it.  Oh, God.  You had to bring that up.  It's an F5.  Holy.  Oh, you didn't say F5, did you?  You didn't say it, Charlie, did you?  Wait, who's the guy?  I recognize his voice.  It's Bill Paxton.  And what's his name?  Oh, jeez.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is the biggest douche in this movie.  Way before he was. 
[01:52:30]  The biggest douche.  Before he got huge as far as movies go.  F5.  Hey, we got St. Louis checking in.  Brian from St. Louis.  You city boys get hit with a little nature and you all S yourselves.  Kind of true.  But we're not like Dallas when they get a dusting of snow and the whole city has to shut down.  We're not as bad as Dallas.  And then Travis from Kansas writes, yes, we are in fact laughing at you.  Yeah.  An F1 doesn't even get my heart rate up here. 
[01:53:00]  No, they don't care about an F1.  They still have to just put like heavy things on the picnic table so the cloth doesn't blow  off.  They'll get like down there.  They'll probably get like F3, maybe F4.  Did they ever get F5s?  Here's the music, too.  Yeah.  People are making fun of us that we know the lines from the movie.  Of course.  Of course. 
[01:53:30]  It's worth watching because it's so awful.  I was wondering what an F5 was.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Because I heard an F5.  Someone said it's the f*** of God.  No.  No.  Finger.  Oh.  Oh.  F5 produces chocolate rain.  There's a cow spinning in a circle.  Chocolate rain.  Everything's getting twisted around.  Chocolate rain.  Blowing all the f***s away. 
[01:54:00]  Chocolate rain.  That's right.  First time a twister ever brought up the property value chocolate rain.  And we were controlling ourselves so well.  Trying anyway.  Come on.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  I got a nice birthday gift yesterday.  All right.  Well, let's talk about that next.  Okay.  And we haven't even talked about, well, I guess we officially did Perv News because of that 
[01:54:30]  Catch a Predator audio we played earlier.  So we can check that off today's list.  We took a few phone calls.  It is phone call Thursday.  It's fun fact Thursday.  We haven't given anyone a fun fact.  Fun fact.  And of course, it's also extreme male camel toe Thursday.  Steve, could you do a camel toe after the break?  Yeah.  All right.  So we have a scale for the camel toe?  Is there like a...  Because I know if you just get, like, barely have a camel toe. 
[01:55:00]  That's like an...  I call it a CT1.  Right.  Like, that's probably walking around.  You can just barely see, like, something going on.  Yeah.  And then CT2, CT3.  I would say we've probably seen some CT4s in here.  Opie pulled off.  I think I gave you a CT4.  There was a lot of twisting going on.  Than did.  Yeah.  And then, Jesus.  Yeah.  CT4.  Because he had one side going this way and the other side down to the ankle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't...  What about a CT5? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I almost poked my eye out.  All right.  We have...  That's the meat of God.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  I've just been informed that the one and the two surprises will happen for you.  Little Jimmy Norton.  One in about...  Thank you.  I don't know.  Two or three minutes.  Okay?  I have a fun fact.  You have a fun fact for Fun Fact Thursday?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  Yes.  In the...  I found out yesterday.  In non-fiction hardcover, number four.  New York Times bestseller.  Whoa!  Happy endings.  Congratulations to Jimmy.  Yeah.  It's more...  What a great birthday gift.  It was.  Yes.  I would say even more congratulations for the show.  Because it's about a promotion.  Let's be honest.  It's about you, Jimmy.  I was just going out there and hawking my stupid book.  Crack the list.  It's about you, Jimmy.  Yes.  Nice.  Off the instant feedback, a guy had a wreck in our backyard yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  Hmm?  Uh, and we used a maxi pad to stop the bleeding on his forehead.  He was really pissed.  She was mad at that?  Some guy from his cell phone relating to what Ant was saying with the diapers, you know,  soaking up the water there.  Yeah, he used diapers in the basement.  Uh, we got Seth.  12-year-old Seth from New York.  Faithful, uh, listener of the show.  Uh, Seth.  Seth, our little friend.  How are you?  I am fine.  Thank you for asking me.  How about you turn your radio down so we can hear you a little better? 
[01:57:00]  You're never too young to turn down the radio.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Turn down the radio.  Yeah.  So, is that better?  Yeah.  Who's there with you?  Okay.  That's awesome.  So, do you need a fun fact or something?  Because I already told you one.  I think I'd like to say more.  Wait.  Well, give us a fun fact for you.  Yeah, give us a fun fact.  That's your job, Seth.  Okay.  Uh, okay.  I told you the one about the Niagara Falls, right? 
[01:57:30]  Uh, what was that one, Jen?  Um, the first person to survive going over the Niagara Falls in a barrel was a 64-year-old  female woman with her cat.  Female woman.  With her cat?  With a cat?  Was her name Travis?  No.  No?  No, he's got a cat or he had one.  Uh, I know that she was 64 years old.  She went over with her cat and she was a math teacher.  Math teacher.  Was she in a barrel, Seth?  Yeah, she was in a barrel. 
[01:58:00]  So, she decided to try to survive the, uh, the plunge, huh?  Yeah.  Did she die?  In my opinion, that was pretty stupid.  In your opinion.  Uh, it's a good opinion.  Well, Seth, uh, your fun fact is, uh, not, uh, ending up with, was the first person in  Niagara Falls in a barrel was a climbing, et cetera.  Was it Annie Taylor?  I don't know.  All right.  I think you're right after all.  I'm sorry.  That's a good fun fact.  I apologize.  Very good, Seth.  You got another one?  Oh, let me think. 
[01:58:30]  Hmm.  I thought you had a couple.  Yeah, no, I'm thinking.  I probably do have a couple.  I just can't think of them right.  Uh, Struff in Boston.  What's going on today?  You can't hang up on the poor young lad.  What's up, Struff?  I have a fun fact for phone call Thursday.  Uh, the, uh, official, uh, FBA and all message board tailgate party for the show Saturday  is going to be starting at about three o'clock.  We're going to meet at 2.45 at a McDonald's in the town of Norton, Mass, in honor of Little  Jimmy.  It's about a minute away from the Tweeter Center on Route 140. 
[01:59:00]  Um, so we're going to meet there at 2.45 and then head on over to the, the Tweeter Center  parking lot at three o'clock and start from there.  Uh, on FBA, we have a phone number posted so that anybody who wants to go who can't get  there right around 2.45 or three o'clock, they can call the phone number and they'll be  able to find us in the parking lot.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, this is an all message board tailgate party?  All message board.  Everyone invited.  Wow.  Whoa.  Are you guys trying to get together on some level?  Bring your Kevlar, people.  We're absolutely trying to get together. 
[01:59:30]  It's, it's not about the message boards.  It's about you guys.  It's about the show.  The jets and the sharks.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Hey, uh, that's...  They're going to rumble.  That's very cool.  We're, we're excited.  We're going up to Boston after, uh, tomorrow's show and we got the comedy show on Saturday.  It's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Got to promote the dancers that will be on the stage.  They're from Centerfolds, Oxford.  Ah.  Yes.  Uh, BCN helping us out getting the dancers together.  Oxford University, right?  Yeah, I'm sure, Anthony.  Is that where they're, no?  I'm sure.  So the tailgating is, uh, is set and then, uh, the village, I got to tell you, Boston or 
[02:00:00]  Mansfield, Massachusetts is going to have the best, uh, ONA village so far.  Yep.  That's what I was reading.  Drown the Clown.  You got Jimmy Hart from the WWE.  You got, uh, Jim Norton.  You're going to be hanging in the village signing, uh, copies of Happy Endings.  Yes.  Uh, we got Skydive New England.  We got the Petting Zoo.  We got the XM Satellite Radio.  Uh, BCN will be representing.  And appearing on the side stage is Fly by Night with Stephen King and Ryan Decoe.  I didn't think his, uh, writing career was going, uh, so badly that he would actually, 
[02:00:30]  uh, be in our, our village.  This odd and hilarious duo combines a bizarre mix of comedy, juggling, and sideshow antics  into one extremely unforgettable show.  Appearing with them for the first time will be Peter Tinno, uh, better known as the Human  Floor, who recently broke his own record by having 2,213 pounds of people stand on him  at one time.  Wow.  All in the ONA Village, uh, this Saturday when we do our comedy show in Mansfield.  Now, all. 
[02:01:00]  That guy had three of our listeners standing on him.  No, there it is.  There's the joke.  All kidding aside, I must say, um, I don't think that is Stephen King, the author.  Oh, no.  So don't get all excited.  No, no.  About that.  And also, for the most part, we will be debuting our latest video.  You know, the hardcore fans will, will find it before Saturday, but on the stage, we will  debut Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with, uh, with something you would find in your yard.  Yes.  Yes.  We will debut that, uh, video and really fast military ID. 
[02:01:30]  You got one.  You're in free this Saturday.  Don't forget.  Spread the word on, on that one because we're trying to, uh, take care of a few troops while  we're up there.  Okay.  All this info should be up on virus tour.  One word on my space.  That can't be true.  Uh, Strump, thank you so much, man.  All right.  See you.  Line one's fun fact is neither fun nor a fact, I would say.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Hopefully he can say this without getting dumped out of.  Chris from Jersey, what's your fun fact?  All right.  The fun fact I got is 3% of the ocean is welcome. 
[02:02:00]  See, he said it in a way.  It's not you can't say that Wednesday.  Yeah, we started you can't say that Wednesday, by the way, Jimmy.  It's fun fact Thursday.  You are saying, now don't say it again, that 3%...  ...of the ocean...  Is what, Chris?  ...is made a shut up.  Is what, Chris?  Is shut up.  Is shut up.  Shut up.  Is a little jizz?  Is that better?  No, that doesn't work either.  Once again, you can't say that, Chris.  You are probably the worst broadcaster ever. 
[02:02:30]  No.  He's not a broadcaster.  He's a phone caller.  Exactly.  But he's broadcasting on the phone.  All right, Chris.  One more try.  Fun fact.  3% of the ocean is what?  Hold on, Al.  Is the stuff that comes out of a whale when he's having sex.  That might work, but...  Shame, sweat?  Just ask Jimmy.  He knows.  Hey, listen.  We got a...  You know, and we got Jimmy's surprise.  We got to do it before the end of this show, and then the other surprise is going to happen  in minutes as well, Jimmy. 
[02:03:00]  Is it a gallon of what this guy's talking about?  Are you saying three parts per hundred of the entire ocean is made up of whale semen?  Yes.  It's not true.  It's definitely true.  Fritz told me.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  And Chris from Wilkes-Barre.  I'm sorry.  Is that true?  There's 362 trillion gallons in the ocean?  Yeah.  Which translates to...  Which translates to...  Oh, look at him.  He's on his iPhone.  Oh, no.  He's doing math.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Yes?  10.86 trillion gallons of whale stuff.  Wow.  No way.  I'm not believing that fun fact.  Every time you swim, you wind up having like a half whale, half person kid.  Yes.  By the way...  Yes.  Yes.  I got to apologize to another Opie hater.  What a nudie.  I'm just taking on the Opie haters.  I'm sorry.  I'll just say sorry every day, okay?  Chris from Wilkes-Barre. 
[02:04:00]  Opie, stop saying there's the joke after every joke, Jimmy says.  Douche.  I'm sorry, okay?  What else do you want from me, Chris?  You should actually say after my joke's bomb because I've thrown a few Lulus out today.  There's the joke.  Nobody has fucking even acknowledged a person talked through.  It's your birthday.  It's not your fault.  It's my fault.  It's your birthday.  We don't want to embarrass you.  All right.  Did I just curse?  Oh.  Wow.  And I'm talking to him and I didn't even notice.  What word did he bomb?  I don't know why Danny was looking at me.  Did I drop an F-bomb?  What bomb did he drop?  The F-bomb.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  And you dropped the S-bomb while you were talking about Twister.  No.  Almost positive.  Yeah.  Where was that?  The one where I clinked it down and went, oh, I almost got it in my eye?  I wasn't sure if he dumped it or not.  It was really close.  I was wondering about that.  But whatever.  We got a big star on the phone.  We got to bring in the cake.  Bring in the cake.  I don't know how to do this.  We're running out of show and we want to do both these things before we move on to XM.  We got Tay Zonday on the phone.  Chocolate Rain.  Wow.  Hey, Tay.  Hey.  We're digging your Chocolate Rain song. 
[02:05:00]  What?  We love the song.  Oh, what?  Can you repeat that?  I didn't get it.  We like your song a lot.  Chocolate Rain.  Chocolate Rain.  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  Are you a singer?  Or is this something you just decided to do?  Because you've got quite a deep voice.  Well, you know what I mean?  It's just something I do on the side as a hobby.  Really?  What do you do for your regular job?  I'm actually a grad student.  Oh, grad student.  And what's...  I've got to ask you.  I've been listening to this song over and over again. 
[02:05:30]  What's the gist of it?  What is the meaning behind this song?  I don't know.  I mean, it's like I'm not even going to get into that debate.  It's kind of like the lyrics come out.  And, you know, that's what they are.  I mean, it's kind of like, you know, what does any other song mean?  I mean...  You're almost like a beat poet.  You're just kind of freestyling?  Yeah.  I mean, I think it has undertones about, you know, racism and institutional racism.  Yeah, yeah, I felt that, but I didn't know if you had, like, a meaning to everything or 
[02:06:00]  some of it was just the kind of words coming out of you.  So what Tay's trying to say is that Voss was wrong again.  It's not about her.  Of course, Voss is not...  Yeah.  He's pretty stupid.  Well, you have a good line about dirty secrets of the economy, and there are a few things that  talk about, like, institutionalized racism.  It's good, man.  Uh, Tay, could you just give us a chocolate ring?  Chocolate ring.  There it is. 
[02:06:30]  Chocolate ring.  We're obsessed with it.  It's like, I mean, it's such a cheesy mix.  All right, I'm so glad he's saying it.  Yeah, where'd the music come from?  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Chocolate ring.  Well, I mean, it's just, I mean, you throw something cheesy up on YouTube, and you don't  think it's going to, like, you think it's just going to be, like, watched by a couple  people, and...  It took off.  Guess what?  You got our attention.  We got a huge audience, and they're all checking it out on YouTube, so watch those views go  up, my friend.  Where do you live, Tay?  Minneapolis. 
[02:07:00]  Okay.  See, I'd like to talk to him more, but we're running out of show.  We're going to call you back very soon there, Tay.  Okay, well, thanks for having me.  And let's just get it out here.  You've heard all the duty lyrics, right, for the song?  What?  Has everyone been doing the duty lyrics to you?  I don't get that.  Oh, boy.  Probably not.  See, he's a real artist.  I know.  The childish...  Like, people say chocolate rain, they're going to make childish duty jokes.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  The nature of idiots.  Well, I think that's above my head. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like a...  As an intellectual.  Yeah, we're talking to an intellect.  Yeah.  I apologize.  We're just idiots.  He's a graduates, dude.  We're all high school dropouts.  Hey, I got you.  You hang out with dropouts, though, Opie.  It's true.  It's hard to follow up on Whale Seaman.  That's true.  I didn't know.  See, you got a little fun fact today there, Tay.  All right.  Bring in the girl.  Tay, I'm sorry.  We're going to call you back and have a real interview about the song, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Tay Zonday, the creator of Chocolate... 
[02:08:00]  Chocolate Rain.  Wow.  Oh, Lord.  That stopped me in my track.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Palomino.  Oh, I'm doing a kick line.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  And everyone thinks we're wowing because the dumb interns did a kick line and they're singing  happy birthday.  The reason we're wowing, we got Gina Lynn in studio. 
[02:08:30]  Fantastic she looks.  We ran into her at the book signing in Philly when we were broadcasting for YSP and she's  here with the birthday cake and barely anything on.  Wow.  You look fantastic.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  And release of Gina Lynn Monster Truck today?  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Well, I have a Gina Lynn motorcycle, so now I upscaled it.  Now I have a Gina Lynn Monster Truck at the Orange Fairgrounds in Little Sacks.  That's when you know you made it.  You got a monster truck.  A monster truck.  It's really beautiful, actually. 
[02:09:00]  We got to see pictures of that.  I'm going to learn to drive it over cars.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Today is just like unveiling.  Oh, that's very cool.  You have beautiful, huge tits.  Hey, you can't say that.  Did you get that, Al?  I was just commenting on her lovely body.  We're going to continue on XM with Gina Lynn and more for Jimmy.  Another surprise minutes away, by the way, Jimmy.  I mean, minutes away.  But Gina Lynn's going to be where today?  At the Orange County Fair?  Yeah.  From 3 to 10 p.m.? 
[02:09:30]  Yep.  I think in Middlesex, New York or something like that.  Orange County Fair in Middletown, New York.  Middletown.  Middletown.  Oh, well, sexy.  And, of course, the website is GinaLynn.com.  We got to get out of here, but we'll continue.  We just ran out of show.  I apologize to the people that are leaving us, but we'll continue, and we'll give you  the stories tomorrow, all right?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Have a great day.  There you go. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, we got to get right back on the radio.  It's a special day.  It's a little Jimmy Norton's birthday.  We're having a birthday extravaganza.  We got Gina Lynn hanging out.  She just brought in the birthday cake.  She's in the smallest bikini I've seen.  Wow.  And, wow, the shoes.  I mean, the whole package.  Let's be honest with each other.  Beautiful.  Yeah, she got those big, tall, platform shoes that are plexiglass. 
[02:10:30]  You could, like, see right through them.  And, yeah, a very nice little bikini.  It's a little hot shorts, not a full bikini.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  About that.  And very nicely endowed.  That's wonderful.  Thank you.  Very good.  Gina's what we call a busty gal.  Yes.  I'll say.  Hey, we were trying to remember.  You were on our show on XM, was it?  Or NEW.  Did we go all the way back to NEW?  Yeah, back then.  And we were trying to, and this is sad, and I apologize ahead of time. 
[02:11:00]  We were trying to remember what you did on the show.  I don't remember.  I didn't even remember what you guys looked like.  Were you on with Montana Gun?  Oh, wow.  I didn't mean it in a bad way.  Oh, man.  That sucks.  Yeah, but.  Were you on with Montana Gun or no?  Maybe.  Is that when Montana Gun popped the ice cube out of her asshole and I threw it in her mouth?  Oh, maybe not.  Oh, remember that?  Steve, do you remember?  I remember Gina.  Why don't we remember what she did on our show?  I remember.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  What?  I remember that Gina was in the NEW studio.  I'm trying to remember what she did. 
[02:11:30]  That's the.  My name wasn't too big back then.  Well, I know, but we remembered you, and the sad thing is you don't remember us, and we're  hurt.  I remember your names.  There's photos of me, I think, with Gina.  That's how I remember she was on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It could have been the ice cube day.  No.  Is there a photo of me behind her hiney sniffing?  Like, is it?  That was Gina Lynn.  I knew it.  You know what?  Wow.  You remember every shot.  Yes.  You're making that face.  You're sniffing face.  The beauty of the ice cream.  Oh, the ice cream.  The ice cube show was what happened to the ice cube after it popped out of the old 
[02:12:00]  anus.  Yeah.  Right in the mouth.  Right into his mouth.  Tossed it right in.  He's not shy.  That guy quite a reaction.  Oh, he didn't care.  Sure did.  He didn't care.  I didn't even look at the idea.  I was at a Montana gun.  She just fucking fired it out.  Yeah.  We were just getting used to some of your things.  Now, that would just be like, oh, it's, you know, it's any day of the week.  Yeah.  Could she do that three more times into my water?  There it is.  That's Jimmy's face.  I remember that shot.  And that's Gina Lynn's ass?  I don't know.  It might be.  I can't tell.  Wait, you can't tell if that's your ass?  No, that's not your ass. 
[02:12:30]  It looks like my butt from, it looks like the back of my hair, too.  I don't like those panties, though.  Oh, they weren't?  No.  You know, but that's like five, six years ago.  That was back in the 70s.  Yeah, they were too high.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  All right.  That's you?  Look, I was a redhead.  That was a lot younger.  Look at that.  You were.  I'm a bad girl.  Oh, look what we used to get away with.  What a naughty girl.  That was regular FM radio back then.  Holy shit.  That is the.  She wasn't doing anything.  You weren't, you weren't, you were just, you know.  You were getting, you were getting like a double lap dance on the lesbian couch. 
[02:13:00]  The legendary lesbian couch.  It was lovely.  Oh, my God.  Straddling Jimmy.  My boy wanted to make milk in his shorts.  Oh, what do you get?  Are you making cumzies?  I have better boobs now.  No.  Wow.  I do.  No, these are like a lot better.  I love the boobs.  Are they like done up?  You know something?  They're very, they're shaped very nicely.  I love them.  Do you want to see them?  They don't look fake.  Oh.  Oh, and they feel so real.  No, it would be illegal for us to actually, holy shit. 
[02:13:30]  I love them now.  Wow.  I went a little bigger.  You did, did you?  How big are they?  34D.  That's pushing a double D.  No, that's what I wear a bra.  It's just because I have a small frame.  Right, right.  No, I know the 34 is a small frame.  That's the D.  But they're so soft.  Are they?  Are they?  Are they?  I'm only saying just to be a, you know.  As in, look at me. 
[02:14:00]  Lovely.  All right, you were on the show with Hot Shannon.  I remember Hot Shannon.  I know Hot, okay.  Crazy girl.  Is she crazy still?  I don't, I don't know.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, she's like older now.  Yeah.  Because she was old then.  Oh, boy.  I love it.  So, Corey, did you know in Hot, Hot Shannon's a meat bag who's out of the business?  Cryptical twat.  How old is Hot Shannon now?  28?  What do we got on Hot Shannon? 
[02:14:30]  28.  You know, can we just put these pictures up for old time's sake?  Because I'm looking at some amazing pictures.  For old time's sake.  Ah, yeah.  That's nice.  That was when I first started coming on the show.  I would wear this awful, it was like a button-down weird shirt that you could kind of see through.  It was really awful.  Oh, yeah.  I kind of remember.  See, your shirt is more awful than the panties she was wearing that she doesn't like anymore.  But those panties were in style for what? 
[02:15:00]  Jimmy was all new to radio.  I know.  For 2000 or 2001, whatever the year was.  I was thinner back then, too.  Were you?  Getting out of the late 90s style.  Yeah.  So, a monster truck.  Oh, it's so cool.  Yeah.  But how is it your monster truck?  Is there something on it that goes, wow, this is obviously Gina Lynn's monster truck?  Well, actually-  Two giant headlights?  No, the guy-  It's all headlights.  No, my whole body is right on the hood and then Gina Lynn on the sides. 
[02:15:30]  And, you know, I have some guys that are going to sponsor me, so I'm going to do the tailgate with my sponsors and stuff.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Man, and do you know what kind of truck it is, or do you care?  It's a big truck.  It's a big truck.  I like them big.  Is that good?  And I'm sure that-  No, it's actually, it's just a Gina Lynn frame off of, like, the guy I'm involved with is Thrasher, and he's been in the business for 15 years.  Thrasher?  I've heard of Thrasher.  So, they're going to bring it out, and the kids will all cheer with their little boners? 
[02:16:00]  No, you know what?  I mean, I'm doing it PG.  I actually got some cute pictures.  Yeah?  I'm not selling any kind of pornographic stuff.  Yeah.  Are you trying to go more legit as well?  Do them both.  Do them both?  La what?  No, because I'm-  La no.  Some of the girls are-  Did you say la no?  What?  She goes, you're trying to go legit.  And I said, la what?  And you went, la no.  Oh.  They stopped.  No, I mean, some of the girls are trying to do more legit things. 
[02:16:30]  That's all.  No, I make good money doing the adult.  It's just a different market of fans than I'm trying to capture.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I'm doing ads for skin industries, motocross stuff.  I had a, you know, my motorcycle is a Gina Lynn motorcycle, so it's pretty cool.  You know what it is about the adult film industry also?  It's like the cigarette industry.  You've got to bring in the kids at some point.  You've got to get them to, like, replace the older guys once they leave.  So, you leave a lasting impression on them when they're younger, and then when they get 
[02:17:00]  a little older, they remember.  Well, there's been criticism about the ads.  They're using Joe Cameltoe.  So, you're saying there's subliminal messages on the monster truck itself?  There could be.  To get them hooked on the porn?  There could be.  It's not even-  Like, when they fuel it up, they open up the gas cap and shove a big cock gas thing  in there and pump it out.  All cock and balls.  It's all cock.  They shove it into the balls, and the gasoline is actually white and thick. 
[02:17:30]  I just did a new movie with Bam Margeras.  I mean, so I'm just kidding.  Oh, did you?  Did you?  I did.  It's called Ming Hags.  Yeah?  It's going to be in the theaters in October, November.  What's it rated?  PG?  PG-13.  PG-13, I think.  What's the movie about?  I think he's just doing different spoofs on stuff.  Yeah?  I mean, I had a little cute bed scene, but it was goofy.  Yeah.  With him.  You have a very cute mouth.  That's, I think, a really creepy thing.  No, no, no.  I mean that in a nice way. 
[02:18:00]  It's really-  You have a pretty mouth.  No, but I don't mean it like that.  I mean like a really-  It's very cute.  It's like you do your own films and stuff like that, but I don't know where I'm going  with this.  Wow, you are just-  I'm crashing.  That's your birthday, Jimmy.  You can do whatever you want.  Yeah.  In a nice way.  Not in a disgusting, lecherous way.  I like my teeth, so-  Yeah, they're really great.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are a lot of-  I mean, you see a lot of the adult industry stars, and they're a little, you know, like,  wow, you've been in the business a while, have you? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, you don't look, you look like you could kind of get out of it and still make a living  doing something else, other than writing a book about the ravages of the adult film  industry.  Well, no, I produce movies now, so I'm investing, so.  I'm saying she could actually just, I'm thinking just still in porn, you could just do scenes  where you're like innocent and wholesome.  Really?  Yeah.  Because she has, like, that little wholesome look to her face, and then-  Thank you.  Yeah.  I've never had anybody say that to me.  No, you could, though.  That's- 
[02:19:00]  No, I was looking at the box of, no, not that one, the video box.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was looking at that.  The one you brought in?  I brought in a bunch.  Oh, well, Steve C. took them all.  I've confiscated these, it's contraband.  And I have to first screen them for any dick.  This one is Drowning in Bitch Juice.  Yeah, it's All Girls, I came up with that title.  All Girls?  All Girls, yeah.  All right, now, I was thinking, because I saw this, you obviously do guy action, though, 
[02:19:30]  too, right?  I love guys more.  Yeah?  Yeah, I just had to put out a Girl Girl title out there.  So this is kind of a stretch for you, doing this kind of a role where it's just you and  other girls?  Well, no, I was strap-on Sally.  Oh!  17 through 22, and I just kind of got sick of Girls, but...  Wait, 17 through 22, the volumes or your ages?  No, the volumes.  Ah.  I just thought that was your name from 17 years old to 22 years old.  What, Strap Attack?  No, that's a different one.  For Silveria. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  So for the most part, you'd prefer a good deep dickin' than going down on women.  Than being in Strap On Sally.  I haven't done another one of those in a while.  No, huh?  You ever bang Rocco, Sofretti, or Nacho?  No, neither one.  Nacho.  Oh, I would love to.  Nacho's booted out of the country.  Why don't we pass over Strap On Sally?  To me, that is very...  But these guys work with transvestites, so I don't want to work with them.  Very good, Steve.  Rocco doesn't, doesn't he?  Rocco, yeah.  Oh, does he?  I didn't think they did Tranny.  Jimmy fucked him.  Kidding, of course.  He's got his dress on. 
[02:20:30]  You don't top Rocco.  You bottom, you silly goose.  Yeah, no, they do Tranny movies.  I know Nacho does.  He blinks a lot, too, but...  Nacho?  Rocco puts out a series like that.  I'm assuming he's in them, yeah.  He's on the covers.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who...  I'm looking at Travis.  Who's the most...  Is there anybody on your no list?  Who's the worst guy that you've ever had to have sex with that you just didn't enjoy?  Brian Pumper.  He's a...  Brian Pumper?  He's a black guy. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah?  He was just such a prima donna.  Gave me all these rules.  And of course...  Don't slap him.  No spitting.  None of this.  So, of course, throughout the scene, I'm doing it because he's telling me not to.  And I was too rough with him.  He was actually one of my second interracial scenes, which I was so disappointed in.  Oh, yeah.  You like to spit?  Yeah.  I like...  I'm rough with the guys.  I like to...  I like them to rub me up, too.  Grab and tug.  Well, I'm really rough with the girls just because I don't like doing girl-girls. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  So I have to be mean to them.  You'll punch them in the ass.  It makes them suffer.  I just did a scene with Ben English and Shiloh Stiles, and I was slapping her ass so hard.  She turns around and looks at me like, Gina, I like you, but chill out.  Wow.  She just gave me this face.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  I was like crossing the border there.  You know Angela Stone?  She's pretty hardcore.  She's into slapping and shit like that.  Like, you can't hurt her.  I heard her name.  I'm not sure who she is.  She squirts.  Oh, she's a good egg.  I just squirted for the first time in a movie. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, congratulations.  Wow.  I didn't know my body can do that.  And did that just happen?  Recently, yeah.  Were you more excited and turned on than you've been in other, during a movie or during like  your private life?  It was a movie.  No, it was a movie.  Yeah.  I was just, I kind of looked down and I'm like, oh, I didn't know my body could do that.  Yeah.  I was in shock.  Wow.  It's kind of cool.  What about your private sex life?  You enjoy it or is it just like, ah, another day on the job?  Well, I don't, I don't extend it like I do for a sex scene. 
[02:22:30]  That's a pain in the butt.  I just like to cum real quick.  Yeah.  No, that's good, you know?  Unless I'm like having a good drunk night and I want to get frisky.  Drunk night is last longer.  If you just need the sex, you just do it and go to sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  He's your boyfriend.  Which one of these guys is your?  The guy with the hair.  Blonde guy.  Are you the porn guy?  All right.  So he's probably not intimidated.  No.  And he's rough.  He always, I'm like, we're not doing a porno scene.  Wow.  He looks like he could be rough.  He was rough.  Jesus.  He just did a scene with this girl and he was so mad at me. 
[02:23:00]  I wanted to go to the pool in Vegas, so I set him up with this, I'm not going to say  her name.  How great is that?  I want to go to the pool.  Let me get him to fuck somebody.  So I can go tanning.  What a great wife that is.  Go ahead.  Finish the story.  Then I got it.  But her name.  Oh, you can say her name.  It's fine.  She was, she called herself Dirty Frenchy.  Dirty Frenchy?  He was so upset.  I set her up, so he had to be so rough with her.  He's like, yeah.  He made her lick his ass for so long. 
[02:23:30]  And then he's like, I'll rip your tits right off, bitch.  Wow.  Oh, man.  You gave Dirty Frenchy?  And she was from Greece.  That's the Frenchy girl.  Beauty school dropout.  He's like, I know you set me up with this so you can go to rehab.  Hey, wow.  Vegas is a pool.  Wow, man.  Take the Wigs got a great one on Instant Feedback.  If she thinks that she was disappointed with her interracial scene, imagine her father.  Jesus.  I just tried to make it boring. 
[02:24:00]  You banged this chick and you made her eat your ass?  For like 15 minutes straight, I'm sitting there watching.  I can't believe she did it.  I won't even do that.  He had his legs wrapped around his head.  Hey, does jealousy ever come into your relationship at all?  Who?  Jealousy?  Nothing, no.  You ever get jealous?  Does he get jealous?  Maybe if we're out at a normal bar, but not like so much in the movies because it's work.  So he's banging another broad in Vegas. 
[02:24:30]  That doesn't bother you on any level whatsoever.  Not that day.  Why?  Some days it does?  Not recently.  Not at all.  Oh.  Like maybe when I first started.  That's no problem.  Yeah, because that was a transition.  I mean, we've been married for eight years.  Wow.  And we've been doing movies right after we got married.  Okay.  Yeah, he looks like he could be a problem.  Yeah.  I'm so glad he's over there behind the glass.  Yeah, but he's a big dude and he fucks.  I talked to, I mean, you know, the Belladonna's husband. 
[02:25:00]  I love Bella.  Yeah, Aiden.  Yeah.  He was like a computer guy.  And all of a sudden they hooked up and they fell in love and they're married and they have  a kid.  But he's not in porn at all.  And he shoots all her scenes.  Yes.  Actually, her first boy girl, because she had a hiatus after she had a little girl.  Travis was her first white guy that she did.  Like back into vaginally.  Because apparently she had done Lexington anally.  Yeah, she's a trooper. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  She took Lexington steel in the ass and she probably laughed the whole time.  She's fucking.  Holy gee.  I had my whole arm into her like that and I was afraid to do it.  And Travis grabs it and just like stick it in there.  And I'm like, wow, I can open my hand up in here.  Oh my God.  It's kind of cool.  Bella is the fucking greatest.  She's really clean too though.  Yeah.  Because some girls are not clean.  That's probably my biggest problem with like girls.  Not clean at all.  Yeah.  Like.  Smells sloppy.  Stinky.  Like I've told girls to douche before. 
[02:26:00]  Ugh.  They have to.  Yeah.  I don't even like having sex without doing that.  Cleaning up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about the ass?  If you go that far into somebody's ass, you have to come out with it.  I wouldn't call it butt jelly.  You got to come out with something.  Butt jelly.  That's what they call it.  Jesus.  You got to come out with something on your head.  They call it cum.  It's just kind of icky stuff.  Yeah, it's not cum.  You don't cum through your asshole from two feet in.  Oh my God.  But I haven't done it at all.  No?  Uh-uh. 
[02:26:30]  You're all fresh.  What about with him?  I haven't done it.  Even in my personal life, he would love to.  You never gave up the ass?  Mm-mm.  Wow.  Are you saving it for anything or you just figure you're never going to do it?  No, I'm freaked out by it.  Yeah?  Like I don't mind if he's doing a scene or some guy's doing a scene with another guy  I'm involved and he's doing it or I don't mind sticking a dildo.  I'm fine with that.  It's just in my ass?  No.  No?  You ever have a finger up there or anything?  Yeah.  No, I have a finger and it irritates me.  It just bugs you.  It freaks me out.  You don't want nothing up your ass.  I'm afraid something's going to come out or I just, I don't know. 
[02:27:00]  I get all tense, so.  Yeah.  And it just feels awful to me.  Well, you have like this clean thing.  I do.  Which is kind of an odd business to be in that you have this whole clean issue.  I can't even have, like he gets really aggravated with me because I can't have sex without  douching.  I'm like, okay, hold on a second.  And I always have it with me.  Whether it's just water or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did a guy make a remark when you were in high school or something?  He caught you on a bad day or something?  No.  I've just been with girls that I've just been like, one time Travis was doing this girl 
[02:27:30]  and we're in a three-way and he pulls out and it's like puff of nastiness.  And we just told her to sit aside while we did her thing and masturbate afterwards.  It was gross.  And after that, I'm just like.  What did it smell like?  I don't know, but we had a brand new camera guy and he's like, can I curse?  Yeah.  He's like, okay, he's like, after everything we've been saying. 
[02:28:00]  He goes, what the fuck is that smell?  And I'm like, because he was like a mainstream guy.  Did he have, when you pulled your mule out, did you have like that little fucking white  froth ring around it?  Oh, God.  Like that fucking yeast infection ring.  That's the worst when you're banging and you pull your hog out and there's not a fucking  ring to show you how far down you are.  Looks like the neck of the Kentucky Derby winner.  It was just, and I just don't want that to ever happen to me or I've done scenes with  girls where I'm doing them real hard with the dildo and, you know, just a bunch of white 
[02:28:30]  shit comes out.  Oh, what is that?  Is that a yeast infection?  It could be either a bacterial yeast or you're ovulating.  So you get that with the ovulation?  Yeah.  Or rabies of the cunt.  Very dangerous.  I mean, sometimes there's no odor, but if there is, that's bad.  That's an infection.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're banging and you still, you see it on your hog and you can't stop.  You're like, all right, we'll talk about this later.  I'll leave some white stuff on my own and get out of here. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  It does stink the room up too.  Wow.  That is really rude.  Remember that couple that we had, uh, uh, having sex on the floor in the studio on the  new carpet, on the brand new carpet.  Yeah, sure.  And, uh, all of a sudden it just started smelling like ass.  It just smelled the whole room stunk of ass.  Here it is supposed to be like, you know, two people having sex, supposed to be a good  thing.  And it just reeked.  It just fucking reeked.  See, I like a little bit of a smell though.  Like not a nasty, dirty smell, but I would never want my girlfriend to douche right before 
[02:29:30]  sex unless she was like, you know, feeling awful.  Well, after she starts getting wet, then there is a certain smell.  I mean, that'll come, you know, it's just not a dirty smell.  You've been hanging around in your, uh, panties, driving around, sweating a little bit and  then, you know, you like that.  See, Jimmy likes, Jimmy likes a little, like little pissy smell too.  Yeah.  If the girl, if I have a kid, if the girl, I either find that repugnant, like if a girl's  been tinkling all day and too busy to wipe, you know, she's on the go.  And, uh, it's either, it's either turns me on like nothing else or it's repulsive. 
[02:30:00]  It's a chemistry thing.  You either have that chemistry with somebody or you don't, but it can be very sexy.  The fucking smell of an ass.  But you also like like an occasional armpit.  Oh yeah.  Stuff like that.  Or it's repulsive.  But there's times where I've fucked a girl before I've held her arm back and I just licked  her pit and the look you get from the side when you're doing that is not.  See, I like, I, I, I like, uh, cleaning product smell.  I like shampoo and conditioner and deodorant and, and that kind of powder. 
[02:30:30]  Like I like, I like, uh, you know, girls to smell pretty like girls.  I want to go to the pharmacy.  I do.  I want to go to the pharmacy and jerk off in the aisle.  Wash and Perel.  Ahead of time.  Excuse me.  Do you have any pert?  No, but you're, you're nasty in the sense that you like to spit.  So you like to get warm.  Oh yeah.  No, I do nasty scenes, you know, because I don't do anal.  I have to compensate for that and just do really.  Yeah.  Talk nasty and, you know, just do my thing.  What's your move? 
[02:31:00]  You got one move you're proud of?  Um, well I love, yeah.  When I go down and I gag and all the spit comes out, but I deep throat it and I just, and  then I kind of look up at the guy and it's like everywhere.  Wow.  And then I use a spit to jerk them off.  That's a good move.  That should be the platform you run on.  That's fantastic.  I'm one of the first girls that like, you know, uh, a guy came in my mouth and then  I drooled it onto the next girl's mouth that was in the scene and then she caught it. 
[02:31:30]  A little snowballing right now.  And then, and one time I sucked it out of a condom cause she wanted to be, wow, he came  into the condom cause she wanted to do a condom scene because she was a little sensitive.  Like if there was something going around, she would get it.  Yeah.  Like the, the smaller stuff.  So she wore a condom and I'm like, okay, we got to make this work so it's sexy cause  condoms suck.  So I sucked it out of a condom and then spit it in her mouth.  Nice.  Showed her.  Hey.  She was fine with that.  Anari Voskia's blowjobs like that.  Do you know who she is? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, I know Anari.  She fucking is like this fucking sloppy, like, ah, and it's all drooly.  And you're like, oh, even more drool.  How nice is this?  Yeah, cause every time you gag, so much spit just like gathers.  It's great.  It makes it a better blowjob and easier.  That's just raw, like, that's a cocksucking.  That's what that is.  When you watch that on a film and you're like, I have got to experience this.  Yeah.  And you do it and make your eyes water.  Like, wrong end.  You're not the kind of girl I want.  My goodness.  So what do you do for fun?  Any hobbies?  She's probably a nerd.  She probably does puzzles. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, right.  And makes like little birdhouse models.  Right.  Do you collect anything?  I just went camping in my backyard.  I set up a tent back there.  You did.  What are you age?  In fact, I was like, no, no, Travis has kids.  I like spending time with my family.  Yeah.  Outside of, you know, my business.  I'm normal.  I remember doing that as a kid.  Oh, it's safer in the yard, you know.  What are you going to do?  My whole backyard is like, it's woods.  I like acres and acres.  See?  Yeah, the industry's been pretty good to you, huh?  Oh, I live in Pennsylvania, too, so I can buy a bigger house. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  We were noticing that.  Jimmy pointed out the fact that, you know, you pretty much.  That movie was, some of that was shot in my backyard.  I was hosing girls down and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  And like you produced these?  Mm-hmm.  Yourself and everything?  Yeah.  Now, how did you, did you just realize, you know, why the fuck am I going to let some  other guy come in here and make money off of this when I could be doing this myself and  banking the money myself?  Well, I was under contract for years and years.  And actually, it was Travis.  He wanted to shoot because we're best friends with Jules Jordan. 
[02:33:30]  He's made it so big in the industry.  Right now, he's become our distributor.  You're a Philly guy.  Yeah.  So, you know.  Oh.  They figured out.  That's the way to do it.  Yeah.  Smart guy.  It works.  Yeah.  When he left Evil Angel, right?  He left Sam and he's on his own.  And he's doing so well.  He's just the golden boy.  Yeah.  He's a little small dude, quiet, and boy.  But he knows.  Probably make, what, $10,000, $12,000 a year.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Well, he's the kind of guy that would have shot porn for free because, you know, growing 
[02:34:00]  up, that's what he loved.  Yeah.  It's just his dream.  Yeah.  He used to work at Excitement Video as a clerk.  Yeah, I heard that.  And now he's like a multi-millionaire.  The biggest in the business.  He's a fucking paranoid gun freak.  Yeah, I love this guy.  And he makes good, he really knows how to film.  No one films an ass walking up the steps better than Jules Jordan.  There's just something about that fucking bubble time.  It's a true talent.  Oh, to film an ass a certain way where it just, it bounces and it just, it talks to  you.  It's like the hall opens up and goes, hello. 
[02:34:30]  Hello.  He's fucking good, man.  Hey, why don't you share your Monster Rain story with Gina?  It's in your book.  It's a cute little thing.  Does she know?  It's probably not appropriate.  Let's see how it really fits in.  It's just, you know.  Do you want photos?  You know what's funny that, oh, never mind.  What?  I almost, nothing.  Oh, you can, you can hint around to it.  No, I can't.  You don't have to say it, but you can hint around to it.  No.  No, I can't.  Is it embarrassing for someone? 
[02:35:00]  No, it's just something I can't.  You can say anything.  No, I really can't.  Oh, for you.  I thought it was our side.  I think I know what she's getting at.  Let's just keep it there for now.  Oh, okay.  I don't, but that's fine.  I just haven't told a great story.  Sorry.  She's been telling great stories.  I love it.  No, I know what she's getting at.  I guarantee I know what she's getting at.  That's all.  I'm glad I caught myself.  Is it the fact that through all of your pornos, Steve was just yelling, more Travis.  I want to see more Travis. 
[02:35:30]  We're implying that you like Travis better than you like Gina.  Yes, exactly.  And just gave me the O.  Now he understands too.  With that, why don't we take a quick break?  All right.  Okay.  We might have another surprise for Jimmy.  We're hoping.  I don't know.  Hope so.  Gina Lynn, she's sticking around for a little while, right?  Where's your site?  GinaLynn.com.  Yeah, it's awesome.  You can see everything on the first, second page.  Oh, good.  Nice.  What you get inside.  Yeah, she's really, really smoking, man.  And she has a monster truck, and that's going to be on display today at the Orange County  Fair in Middletown, New York from 3 to 10 p.m. 
[02:36:00]  So you'll be up there hanging out and meeting people?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I'll be signing autographs and stuff.  I know.  I'm going to see the truck for the first time, so it's cool.  I saw it while they were building it, but not fully done.  Cool.  Also, as we go to break, we've got to do the Aussie thing.  Or is this Aussie, too?  I want to hear the Aussie.  Is this answered?  Yeah.  Especially for XM.  For Jimmy's birthday.  Oh, it's a mackerel.  What happened?  Going into the room and talking to the boys. 
[02:36:30]  Gina, what happened?  I thought we were having fun.  Nah, she's...  What happened?  She was taking a break?  She thought we went to break.  Yeah, we're taking a break.  No, that's okay.  You can go and talk to the boys.  It's okay.  No, you don't have to.  We're going to break.  You can talk to your boys.  I was just messing with you.  Go talk to Travis.  You hurt our feelings.  He does screw with people like that.  The second they leave the room, he goes, where are you going?  What are you doing?  We get this feeling like we're all getting along, and then we go to dinner and stuff,  and then we realize...  Dinner?  It's just a radio show.  We've got a very sensitive...  If you go to dinner with them, you know what you've got to eat on Travis. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Seems to like it.  Yeah, dinner at their house is a little different than what I'm used to.  I don't want the angry pucker special.  Right.  Jimmy, this is for you.  Hi, Jimmy, you fucking asshole.  It's me, Ozzy.  Happy birthday, and I have many more to come.  God bless you.  Stay safe.  I'll see you when I see you.  Wow, that's fucking great.  That's my outgoing message.  That's good.  I think we have another one for you, too.  It's... 
[02:37:30]  He was pointing to...  Oh, okay.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yes!  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Find him for Jim Norton and to wish him a very happy fucking birthday.  Have a great time.  I wish I was there to enjoy the fun with you, but we'll meet again soon.  God bless you.  Stay safe.  Happy birthday once more.  Oh, by the way, Jim, you know Opie and Anthony, they really fucking suck.  You dick. 
[02:38:00]  How much does Ozzy rule?  Oh, the beginning of that one's great, too.  And we're so needy, I heard Opie and Anthony, I'm thinking, oh, I was expecting you guys  all right, too, or something, you know?  No.  Dude, that's the promo.  That is great.  Yeah, let's take a break.  More with Gina Lynn and more for Jimmy on his birthday with Opie and Anthony.  Lovely Nordic nymph, jiggly Jimmy Norton. 
[02:38:30]  Know that paltritude is real.  It's real.  Smooth amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts.  Shaved like a booksum baby.  As hairless as a toad.  Too much for one man.  Without a apology.  Oh, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:00]  Still got to talk to Pat Duffy a little bit about him brushing his teeth with dog shit  yesterday.  What a day.  Bringing an end to the duty wars.  Yeah.  Our own Travis got married.  Wanted to talk to him.  And then we have Travis on the couch, Gina Lynn's husband, and he started telling a great  story.  We're like, yo, stop right there and let's get it on the air.  Now, what's the story again?  It was Gina Lynn's friend.  She wanted to go to the pool at the Hard Rock. 
[02:39:30]  Hold on.  Go ahead.  She was a fan of mine.  She was a fan of yours?  I promised her I would shoot her.  She was such a sweet girl.  Mm-hmm.  So you promised, you know, you'd do...  I didn't remember exactly what she looked like, you know.  She seemed okay that night.  But all you wanted to do was...  She had a nice body.  You wanted to go to the pool, and...  Yeah, I wanted to go to the pool.  It was, um...  They have rehab at the Hard Rock.  So, my friend was down, so, you know, I set him up with a scene that day. 
[02:40:00]  And I was pissed.  And why were you pissed?  Because I didn't want to do a scene.  I was out there to relax, you know.  Right.  And she just threw it at me.  But this girl comes up to the room, rings the bell or knocks on the room, and I open  the door, and she's like...  She's from Paris, I guess.  She goes, hello, are you Trevis?  I'm here to suck your cock.  And she...  It was like a deep voice.  And I was...  I looked at my camera guy, and I'm like, oh, no.  Like, we're in trouble.  And...  Was she ugly?  She just had her lips done. 
[02:40:30]  Uh-huh.  So they just like...  Oh, the duck bill thing.  Oh, my God.  It was like, tranny kind of like, you know.  It freaked me out.  Definitely freaked me out.  So, uh...  We...  We got to doing the scene, and, uh...  You know, in my head the whole time, I just thinking, like, if Gina was here, I'd just  punch her in the fucking head, you know.  So I figured I'd take it out on this chick, and, uh...  I'm sitting in this chair, and she's, you know, going down on me.  And then, uh...  I was like...  I was like, you want to eat my ass out? 
[02:41:00]  And she goes, you like?  You like?  And I'm like, yeah.  So...  She's eating my ass out, and she's getting all into it, like, spreading.  She's spitting in my ass.  Oh, my God.  So, so I, I lean back, and I put my legs up, you know, I'm holding my legs up like this,  and my camera guy's just shaking his head, and I'm like, yeah, eat my ass.  And she goes, I'm a dirty Frenchie.  I'm a dirty Frenchie.  But, uh...  It was so funny.  I just had her go...  Kept her...  Kept having her do it. 
[02:41:30]  You complain about that scene that I set you up with a girl you weren't attracted to,  but you show everybody that scene.  It's so...  It's just funny.  It's so...  Yeah, he goes, oh, I should have brought the video for you guys.  There's an award for that one.  We'd love to see that.  She had these huge tits.  I'll send it to you guys for sure.  She had these huge tits.  So, like, I make her slap, beat my ass, and I'm fucking her tits and smacking them, you  know, and I'm looking at her, and I slapped her in the face, and she goes, oh, yeah, you're  so rough.  I said, shut up, or I'll rip your fucking tits off.  And she just looked at me, like, like, you know, but I... 
[02:42:00]  The whole thing was just, like, like a mean fuck.  It was crazy.  I didn't care.  Because you were mad at her.  Jesus.  Because you were mad at Gina.  Yeah.  I thought she looked good when I met her, like, a few weeks before that.  When you see pictures of...  I'm telling you, I had to make sure she didn't have a dick.  Oh, wow.  It was...  I hear you.  But now she's like...  So how'd you get up for the scene?  How did I get up?  That's exactly what I'm asking.  Oh, yeah, what were you?  I like really dirty shit.  So once she started eating my ass out, you know, it's like... 
[02:42:30]  Like he was saying about the ass thing, like, with girls like Gina, all I gotta do  is sniffed her ass, and I'm hard.  I don't know what it is.  It's...  Because sometimes...  She's making faces.  You like the smell of an ass, though, right?  It's fucking nice.  Gina's a clean girl.  She doesn't want any smell.  So that causes a little bit of a problem.  She'll tell you.  She's like, you're always gonna think you're fucking me in the ass, because I'll sniff  her ass, and I'm like, all right, I'm good to go.  Let's go.  You know?  But like you said, it's like, most of the time, it's a good thing.  Sometimes you get like, whoa, shit, you know? 
[02:43:00]  It's like...  But I don't know what it is.  I just like the dirtiest.  The smell of an ass after, say, a fucking...  After someone rides a unicycle for a while, it can be nice if the chemistry is...  Yeah.  That chemistry is sexy.  When you fucking put your nose between the cheeks, and you even close your mouth, you  see, you're not breathing any other air in.  You want it all through the fucking nose.  Like, sometimes we'll go to the gym and work out, and she's all sweaty, and I'm like, oh,  come on, let's do it, you know?  And she's like, no, I'm all sweaty.  She'll run to the bathroom, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I don't want to do it now. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, wow.  You get lazy.  You know what I mean?  It's like...  Yeah, with sex, with him, he's so lazy.  He's really good at scenes.  He'll open up his legs.  He's like, okay, crawl between my legs and give me a blowjob.  You won't even turn on your side for me.  Oh, that was one time.  They're regular people.  I love it.  That's what I'm learning today.  Pretty much regular people.  And it was like three, four in the morning, and I'm like, if you want it, you got to get  there.  And she tried crawling over me, and I was like, no, go down to the edge of bed and crawl 
[02:44:00]  between my legs.  Just like any other guy.  Roll with chips on his stomach, watching TV.  She films me sometimes, and sometimes it's a little weird for me.  I have a little bit of a hard time, because I'm thinking...  I'm not getting mad.  I'm concentrating on getting the right camera angles.  I am.  She shot this thing one time when it was a blowjob.  Yeah.  And she's sitting there.  She's laughing.  And we cut, and the girl goes to the bathroom.  I said, what the fuck are you laughing about? 
[02:44:30]  She goes, it rewinds it.  And here, I went to the bathroom before the scene started, and I wiped my ass.  Do you ever wipe your ass with that toilet paper that kind of clings to you?  Yeah, yeah.  So I have all this white, fuzzy shit on my ass, and I'm making this girl blow me and  lick my ass, and just fuzz all over her.  You guys run.  I had to keep that.  Boy, dude, you shit before a scene and wiped your crack, and then just went right in there?  Yeah, I usually use baby wipes to make sure everything's clean, but I couldn't find  any, so...  So what the hell?  Is there, like, might be a dumb question. 
[02:45:00]  Porn bloopers?  Oh, dude.  Yeah, our behind the scenes.  You're going to see some crazy...  He ate chicken between one of his scenes while he was doing the girl.  Oh, really?  Hey, chicken?  What, is there actually, like, tapes you could get?  Porn bloopers?  Oh, there is, but I don't have...  We have the behind the scenes.  The one girl, tell them the story about Naomi.  Naomi.  The sheep's...  Oh, oh.  She didn't know that we were saying.  Gina was shooting this girl, and I was doing her in the ass.  And, like, she won't do it, so she kind of gets freaked out about it.  I'm doing an up-and-over doggie. 
[02:45:30]  And I'm just plowing this girl in the ass.  And I'm telling Gina with the camera, get in here.  I'm going to pull out, and you're going to get this big, gaping asshole.  And she's going, I don't know.  You know, it's got this look on her face.  So she comes over there, and I pull out, and the girl, like, ass farts.  And it sprays and hits Gina in the face.  She's pulling the camera.  You see the gaping asshole, and she goes, ah, I'm hit, I'm hit.  I'm hit.  Like a soldier.  She's like, I'm hit, I'm hit.  That's not the story I was talking about.  Oh, man.  That was a gem, though.  Yeah, that's a great one. 
[02:46:00]  She's all disappointed, but that's a good story.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, we got so many good ones.  It just seems there would be a market for a true porn blooper tape.  A lot of people email us and tell us, dude, the behind-the-scenes shit.  Our behind-the-scenes.  Really funny.  I try to have fun on the set, so I always fuck with people, you know?  Like, I'll fuck with my camera guys, hit the camera and shit.  What's the story she refers to?  That she was referring to?  Well, me and Jules, you seem like a big fan.  He's like...  I was second camera, and then we had a main camera guy. 
[02:46:30]  Because sometimes I'll get in there, and I'll grab the girl's head while I'm holding the camera,  and make her suck on the guy's dick.  And I'm like, choke on that shit.  It's good.  It's good stuff.  That's called a team effort.  Nice.  But we were doing this chick named Naomi, and really, really good scene.  And afterwards, we both popped in her face, and she couldn't see.  And we couldn't find a towel because we were shooting on location.  I had to walk her up to the bathroom.  So Gina's walking her up to the bathroom, holding the camera.  And somebody went to get a towel, and we followed her in there.  And, I mean, this is like a $10 million home. 
[02:47:00]  She's standing there, and she didn't know we were standing there with the camera.  You know, she's just loaded.  Her eyes are closed.  She can't see.  And she's standing on a sheepskin rug, like real sheepskin, like nice shit.  And she didn't know we were doing it.  She picks it up and wipes her face off.  And when she wiped her face off, she's like, oh, my God.  I didn't know you were still here.  She screams because she saw us filming her.  And we were laughing.  We're like, oh, my God.  Like, I can't believe you just did that.  There's a giant load in her face.  And now she's got a Picasso.  What I'm saying is that? 
[02:47:30]  Pulled his towel off the wall.  Holy shit.  You guys got to hit the road with your comedy act, man.  Hey, dude, do you ever – this is my thing, too, because the guys always amaze me in porn, too, because you guys – you have to function.  You have to keep – I mean, you know – and I'm such a nervous wreck when I fuck.  I can't ever picture doing that under a pressure situation like that.  You ever lose the ride or not be able to?  What do you do, or what do you do?  Yeah, everybody has their good days and bad days.  It's – when I first started out, it was more of a nervous thing, everybody around. 
[02:48:00]  But you kind of learn to block that out and just kind of focus, you know.  So my whole thing now is I like to show off.  So it's like I don't even care who's around.  Right.  It's just about, you know – but I still have my – you still have bad days.  That's embarrassing, right?  It used to be when I first started out because everybody's like, ah, this guy's no good.  But, you know, I've done over 300 movies, so I got nothing to prove.  So if I have a bad day, you know. 
[02:48:30]  But the thing is, there's so many guys that are, like, shooting their cocks up now.  Like, camera gear, whatever it's called?  Yeah.  Wait, wow.  What?  What is this?  The guys shoot – I think that's how much you're going to pronounce it.  They shoot – they put a needle in their dick, which is, like –  It's way better than Viagra, apparently.  Well –  Is it to plump it up or just to keep it hard?  Like, to make it bigger, though?  No, no, no.  It makes it hard, and it stays hard.  What can happen, though?  Uh-oh.  All right.  Give it up.  Give it up.  It looks like Gina has given you a talking to her as far as doing this. 
[02:49:00]  I don't even know if I want to go here.  Oh, please.  There's so many people that are going to hear about this.  Oh, shit.  All right.  I said I would never do it.  I said if I can't mentally get there, then I would never do it.  Yeah.  Well, the Frenchie girl, my camera guy, has this shit.  So he's like, dude, don't worry about it.  I got this shit.  I'm like, nah, fuck that.  I ain't doing that, you know.  But it started out, and it was like – I had a tough time getting started.  So, you know, I tried this shit. 
[02:49:30]  Where do you shoot it?  Is it into the base of your dick or is it in the area?  Right in the base of the dick.  Well, see, this is the only – I didn't know anything about it.  Yeah.  I was like, dude, is this clean, you know, and he filled it up.  It was a clean needle, you know, and I'm all worried about this.  What's it filled up with?  I don't know.  It's something – inject –  I know.  He injects something into his dick that he doesn't know.  Yeah.  See, this – okay.  I didn't – I had no idea.  I think it's called caverjet.  Am I correct?  Something like that.  I think that's what it's called.  But it was really stupid on my part.  Anyway, so he goes, oh, dude, just shoot it now. 
[02:50:00]  It'll take a half hour.  Well, it took five minutes, and I didn't even take the stills, and I was like walking around and shit.  I had to take my pants off to take the stills.  I'm fucking hard as a rock.  You know, and it was crazy.  Like, this shit, like, is insane.  And I could see, like, guys – like, anybody could do porn on this shit, you know?  So, well, we did the scene, shot, like, for two hours, and, I mean, I fucked this chick up.  You know, because I – I could have fucked the door, man.  I'm serious.  This shit was – but – so afterwards, everybody leaves, and I'm laying there, and it's starting to hurt really bad. 
[02:50:30]  And I took a cold shower, took a nap.  To make a long story short, 10 hours later, it wouldn't go down.  So, I called my boy up.  I'm like, dude, what the fuck did you give me?  And I was like, dude, you've got to come get me and take me to the hospital.  That's scary.  So, they're still at the pool.  Actually, they were all fucked up.  I was drunk.  So, they had no idea.  I spent the whole night in the hospital, 14 hours before.  How'd they get – where they just keep sending in fat chicks until it finally went to the pool? 
[02:51:00]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I wish that – you should have seen me at the hospital.  Either they make you wear the gown.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm in pain, but I'm trying to, like –  They put you on morphine.  Yeah.  They shot me up with morphine.  But I'm walking around.  I'm walking out, and all the nurses are out there.  And I'm like, can you tell me the bathroom?  I'm talking like a tent, dude.  Like, I'm –  And this gal, you know, my – it's sticking out so far.  My ass is hanging out.  And they're just looking. 
[02:51:30]  They're sitting there trying not to laugh at me.  And I'm like – my buddy's sitting there going, dude, you're fucking crazy.  What's the procedure to get rid of it?  They stuck two needles in me and drew blood out of my shit.  Holy cow.  I'm like a urologist.  I just saw the bill.  The hospital didn't know what to do, so they called a urologist.  And he took his time, you know.  But I tell you what, like –  They're still talking about you at that hospital.  They gave you morphine for the pain, and then they, like, sucked out the blood out of you.  Lucky for two days.  Yeah.  You're a mess.  You're fucking lucky, dude.  I mean, you can really –  Well, I'll tell you what, I think that I have problems now. 
[02:52:00]  Like, I still perform, but I have pain that I never had before.  Wow.  And it's a little to the side.  Yeah, and it tilts to the side where I shot it.  Not noticeable, but I can feel it.  Wow.  I looked into it, and they told me that the problem is, like, these guys taking – there's  cartilage damage.  The wall breaks down a little bit?  Yeah.  It is called cabbage.  That is the –  Okay.  Yeah.  So, like, I still perform, and I can still function, no problems, but I tell you what, 
[02:52:30]  I don't – it scared me.  I'll never do it again.  Wouldn't recommend that stuff, huh?  Hey, everybody fucks up, man.  It's like Viagra.  I've taken Viagra.  I love each of you better.  And also Cialis.  It's like, how do you not try it?  It's like someone says, look, this will make you a dick, and with porn, you've got to stay  hard.  Yeah.  It's like, eh.  It's hard not to do it.  I think he just overdosed.  Maybe he took too much.  Yeah, needle full.  Sounds like a lot.  Yeah, the urologist says, well, how much did you take?  And I'm like, I don't know.  I called the guy.  He goes, you took 10 cc's. 
[02:53:00]  And he goes, holy shit, dude, you only needed two.  So, I was like, well, fuck, I didn't know.  I said, I don't even know what I took.  It was stupid on my part.  But I was kind of like, you know, dirty Frenchie.  Dirty Frenchie.  Pissed off.  Mad at the chick.  Yeah.  I was down at the pool getting hammered.  You wanted a weapon.  You didn't want a hard dick.  You wanted a fucking weapon.  I couldn't work for like three weeks, because I could only do interracial scenes, blowjob  interracial scenes, because my dick was black and blue. 
[02:53:30]  So, fucking, it finally went down.  It was probably sore for a few days.  Yeah.  When you bang, even on Viagra, if you bang hard enough, you don't realize that you're  banging a little harder than you think the next day you're sore.  That's got to be fucking awful.  10 hours.  It looks like you're taking a photograph in 1905 with the fucking hospital Johnny tenting  out.  There's this sharp pain shooting through it.  But, like I said, I've done a lot.  I've been doing this for eight, nine years. 
[02:54:00]  Sometimes, a couple years ago, I was banging this chick who, doggy style, she didn't have  an ass.  You ever hit a, bang a chick, and they got that bone, and it hits you there?  Well, I got a hematoma.  I was out three months.  I blew a blood vessel.  Ow!  It popped, and, like, I'm sitting...  Your dick got a weightlifter injury.  Like, I pulled out, and at the base of my dick was, like, about that size of a quarter,  a big, clear lump, and I was like, what the fuck is that? 
[02:54:30]  And I touched it, and all of a sudden, it just burst, and blood...  We got it on video, the blood...  Oh, my God!  But, uh, it was for Jules.  Get the fuck out of here!  Oh, my God, Sam!  He's bleeding from his dick, Sam!  It didn't hurt.  It didn't hurt.  It just filled up with blood, and it just swelled up so big.  And, uh, so, she was upstairs, and I went upstairs, and I was like, listen, I was like...  I went to the hospital, and I was like, ah, he goes, that's a hematoma. 
[02:55:00]  He goes, you must have really been pounding his dick hard.  And, uh, so he, you know, gives me some antibiotics and some pain pills and stuff like that, and  hands me a pack of some Viagra.  This is a regular doctor that helps all the male performers.  Like, I'm gonna need Viagra for a while.  Yeah.  Do you find Viagra the best thing?  I found that a Cialis works the best, because, like, the next day, you don't even know it's  still in your system.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, something happens.  See, I tried to...  Ooh, the Cialis, and there's something else.  What, is that the little bear pill? 
[02:55:30]  Levitra, Cialis, and...  Yeah, I didn't...  See, I like to have control, and I just didn't feel like I had control with that.  The Cialis?  Do you have Viagra, you mean?  No, not Viagra.  The little...  Levitra.  The new stuff.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's...  I don't know what it is.  It's a little bear pill.  A little bear?  It says bear, like bear aspirin on it.  Oh.  No, I know.  That's a new one, obviously.  I never heard of that.  It's Levitra.  I don't know.  Whatever it is.  This is new to me.  I can eat it, shoot it into my dick.  I don't know what it is.  You gotta be careful taking it. 
[02:56:00]  These guys take this shit every day.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I've heard it's not bad for you, though.  I asked the doctor, and he goes, no, it's not addicting, it's not bad.  I mean, again, those guys take it, but they're fucking literally for hours.  For hours.  You gotta appreciate the old school guys when you realize, you know, they were just going  off of, you know, heroin, pot, whatever else they get there.  Right.  But there's guys in the industry that, like I know, that do two, three scenes.  They tell me they take two or three Viagra a day.  And I'm like, don't you have side effects and shit? 
[02:56:30]  And then the guy goes, well, I see blue spots all the time.  And I'm like...  That would be a side effect.  Yeah.  Like, that's, to me, I don't know.  Maybe there's a problem.  I don't do drugs.  I'm not a drinker or anything like that.  So I'm, like, really weird about that shit.  I'm like, I'll shoot a needle.  I'm like...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you went from fucking, like, I'd rather not have a cigarette.  It's bad for your health.  All of a sudden, you're speedballing with Belushi in a hotel.  10-hour boner.  The funny part was, I was in the...  I didn't get out till 7 in the morning in the hospital.  I'm like, how the fuck am I going to tell my wife? 
[02:57:00]  She's going to freak out that I even did such stupid...  Yeah, because you would talk shit on the guys who didn't, and then you go do it yourself.  I know.  It was bad.  Did you turn around and go, well, if you didn't set me up with that fucking dirty Frenchie...  I blamed everything on her.  Gotta turn it around.  That a boy.  Oh, man.  What stories?  My God.  Okay, good.  Surprise number two, or actually number three, because the Aussie was a surprise too, is here.  So we've got to take a break, and this one is just as good.  Oh, good. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, Gina, you're terrific.  Trust me.  Oh, I know the surprise is good.  Don't tell me.  Yeah, Gina even knows the surprise is good.  This is the joke I tell when someone says, how old are you?  I say 29 again, and we all LOL.  Is there anything worse?  No.  That's not a real joke.  Of course it's not.  Is there anything worse than when you ask somebody how old they are, and they try to be funny?  Like, well, how old do I look?  You know something.  Tell me.  I'm 39.  Before we take a break, let's make sure everyone knows that Gina Lynn has a monster truck. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And it's going to be on display at the Orange County Fair in Middletown, New York, today from 3 to 10 p.m.  And, of course, GinaLynn.com.  And is it called hematoma, the truck?  Is that what I know?  By the way, just a word of advice for Gina and Travis.  When someone says they're 39, you're not supposed to go, oh, you're supposed to go, really?  Oh, poor Jim.  He's 40, so that doesn't make it.  Really?  Wow.  To me, that's not all.  You're not 40?  Yeah.  See how good that feels?  I'm surprised.  We're young with them. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, we are.  Hey, Dan G. from Jersey.  Levitra is made by Bayer.  Okay, that's what he's saying.  Okay.  And let's not forget, we've got Joel McHale still calling in today.  A real busy show.  And Al Roker.  Supposedly calling in, yeah.  Well, thanks for having us.  Well, you can hang whatever.  We're not booting out.  You're sticking around for the next surprise, right?  Yeah.  For Jimmy's birthday?  Sure.  Birthday.  This is a really cool one.  I don't know how the guys pulled this one off.  Definitely.  I'm pretty psyched.  Please tell me they're bringing in Danny and we're having an intervention.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:59:00]  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girlfriend.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the school position.  All right.  Oh, little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the Roker Cam Criminers.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right. 
[02:59:30]  What a show today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Jim Norton's birthday.  Don't forget to pick up Happy Endings in honor of Jim Norton's birthday.  Tina Lynn on the couch with her husband, Travis.  And the next surprise is entering the studio with another cake for Jim Norton.  Aw.  Another cake?  Look at the door, Jimmy.  What's that?  Cakes are good.  Another cake?  Yeah.  That's okay.  Takes a little.  And here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen.  From Chill TV. 
[03:00:00]  It's Jill.  Nickelodeon!  Ew!  It's Jill!  Thank you.  How cool is that?  What the hell just happened?  I just came out of the cake.  Wow, look at that.  Oh my gosh.  I brought like a Fudge of the Whale cake.  And they told me to give you this cake instead.  That's more appropriate.  Tell them what this looks like.  I can't believe you're such a good sport.  You've got to explain the cake she's carrying in. 
[03:00:30]  No, it's great.  It's a cake with two lovely breasts.  And like, it looks like a dick.  And apparently she was, something squeezed and came out all over me.  Yes, it certainly did.  It's liquid on me.  It's got a little pumper.  And it's very odd that I can think of four people this cake reminds me of.  That is lovely.  The cake just squirted all over you.  How you doing?  Are you surprised?  Yeah, extremely.  Yeah?  Jill Nicolini with a dick cake.  Nobody would have ever convinced me that that was going to happen. 
[03:01:00]  And you're not going to get fired.  That's the beauty of the whole thing.  How cool is that?  Oh, thank you.  Hello, finally.  I got to meet everyone.  I'm so excited to be here.  I know.  Finally.  Oh my gosh.  Where's this Jill TV?  Right there.  Look.  Come on.  Jill TV.  Oh my goodness.  That channel does not change ever.  And it's only on Channel 11 all the time, right?  All the time.  Yeah.  We got Maury on.  You guys watch Springer too?  Yeah.  It just runs through on Channel 11 here in New York all the time.  The shirt is famous.  I just saw that this morning.  I was commenting how beautiful it looked on you. 
[03:01:30]  Thank you.  My God.  Everyone thought I was late because I was changing my outfit.  And I said no.  No.  We were stuck in the worst gridlock ever.  Because of the steam explosion.  Yeah.  And everything was closed down.  So it took us about 45 minutes.  Were you bummed that you weren't doing traffic during that whole thing?  That's a big traffic story.  I was happy doing entertainment today because it would have been a lot of work on the traffic.  All those red cars you could have pointed out.  The red cars and the green cars.  The green cars and the red cars.  I know you like that, right?  We love it.  The cars just banging into your body. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, they do.  I love the traffic.  And the media is picking up on Jill TV.  They just write about it all the time.  We were hiding the paper from you, Jimmy, because we made the paper.  Channel 11's Jill Nicolini will talk to Opie and Anthony today at 9.30 on XM Satellite Radio.  It should be fun since ONA often refers to Channel 11 Morning News as Jill TV.  Oh, good, good.  It made the paper today.  We've got to thank Richard Hart for that.  He's a good friend of mine.  He rocks.  We love it.  We hated him at first.  You did?  We had a little problem.  Then we turned around.  He bashed us. 
[03:02:30]  With a quick interview.  And then we're like, yeah, you want to bash us?  Why don't you call us, man?  And we'll show you.  And he called us and we're like, oh, hi.  He's the coolest guy.  And he ends up being a real cool guy and we're a bunch of pussies here anyway, so we'd back  down to anybody.  It was just, oh, yeah.  Excuse me.  Head on over to that microphone over there.  Oh, look, I got so.  I keep talking, guys.  So when did you become aware of Jill TV?  I became aware of, well.  I hear your brothers are big fans.  Oh, my brother's a huge fan.  My cousin Rob.  Everyone's listening.  They always listen. 
[03:03:00]  And everyone sends me clips every day of what you guys say, what you talk about.  Because I don't get to listen.  I hope the more innocent clips, by the way.  Oh, oh.  I know them all.  Oh, no.  I know every clip.  And we're going to talk about that.  No.  We've got to clear up some stuff today.  No, you guys have been great to me overall.  Yeah, you have been.  I love you guys.  Where are you from now, original?  I'm born and raised in Long Island.  Like you all.  See?  We figured that one out.  I went to Sachem High School.  Sachem?  Harborfields.  John Kline.  John Kline.  Okay, cool. 
[03:03:30]  So out in Farmingville, Holtzville.  And now I live in the city.  Yeah.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  You moved to it.  But you still got to drive out there to see family and stuff?  Oh, every weekend.  And I only moved back into the city three months ago.  Really?  I love Long Island.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I love Center Reach.  Thirsty Thursdays?  Come on.  Let's talk about Thursday Thursdays.  No, no, no.  We started this new bit when you're not there.  We just assumed that you had a really rough night out.  That you were out.  And I call in sick like this.  He's cold as hell about everything.  And my voice sounds like. 
[03:04:00]  Sorry.  Like that.  We hear the Tara Reade at some mornings.  We're like, oh boy.  We know how those Long Island girls can be.  No, I need to clarify that.  It's usually a Monday you take off.  We're thinking the Hamptons.  I love the Hamptons.  But no.  I have serious vocal issues.  I need some sympathy here.  Really?  Yeah, I have nodules in my vocal cords.  How the hell did that happen?  It's from draining your voice.  So I'm on like a.  I take Asmonex.  So it's like a cortisonex steroid.  And actually, I'm going back to the doctor tomorrow to get another set. 
[03:04:30]  Because it's all in flames.  That's from loud clubs.  Another ice team, please.  Another ice team.  Shots for everybody.  I love this band.  I love these guys.  It's Absolute Kamikazes.  And it's Pinot Grigios.  And it's Willow Cabernet.  That's more my speed.  But hey.  Yeah.  No longer an ice team for me.  I respect you for calling us out of this stuff.  Oh, you guys are awesome.  We were so happy when they got you out of the helicopter.  Yeah, me too.  Now, were you scared in there a lot?  Because just statistically. 
[03:05:00]  Scared?  Are you kidding me?  Come on.  I know.  One went down two weeks ago.  I'm one of the boys.  She's a tough Long Island broad.  No, no, no.  I used to take private pilot lessons.  I have 65-hour training in a Cessna 172.  I've soloed.  I love flying.  Yeah.  And I stopped right before I got my license.  But I'll go back to it one day.  So I love flying already.  So I'm not scared.  Yeah.  So you're not scared of that.  I'll jump out of planes.  Really?  Come on.  You live once.  It's safe.  Honestly, flying is safer than driving.  Take a look at what happens every morning.  Red cars.  Red cars.  Exactly.  I was in a car accident this morning on the way in. 
[03:05:30]  You're kidding.  Where?  Oh, you could have called it in and been a red car.  I could have been a red car today.  I could have given you a shout-out.  Kenny, who drives me in.  Yeah, we got in a nice accident this morning.  One of the cars was totaled.  They went through a green light, and somebody blew through a red light.  Coming home from the club.  And they wound up broadside.  Just like you.  You know.  The time we go to work, there's only...  The drunks.  Thank you.  Yeah, for the most part.  Oh, yeah.  I see a lot of them.  And guys delivering papers going down streets the wrong way.  Well, guess what? 
[03:06:00]  That's my father, because he works for the New York Post, so he's one of the crazy truck  drivers that do that.  And I got into three accidents this year, and I got into three last year.  People hit me in the morning.  Oh, my God.  No, yeah.  I could just see you, though, going down the expressway, putting your makeup on, going,  oh, my God, I'm late.  I gotta get...  No, no, I do.  Using that scissor eyelash thing.  I don't need that, but no, I'm heavy on the pedal.  I am, but thank goodness.  Oh, good girl.  Friends with a lot of cops.  Thanks, guys.  That's my gold bag. 
[03:06:30]  I love it.  Hey, don't blow up our spot, man.  90 coming in.  You should have saw the treatment we got this morning.  Make it in from Long Island in no time in the morning.  That's a little slow.  Ooh.  All right.  Maybe I could drive in with chill.  You can.  I'll pick you up.  Great.  You do realize that you're running Channel 11 News by now, right?  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  You do know.  I'm trying my best.  And we know Linda Church is a fan of the show because we did Channel 11 News.  I think before you got there.  She's a big fan.  And the first thing she said was like, oh, I love you guys. 
[03:07:00]  But we see that she's not happy.  When you get done with the traffic, she's just kind of, thanks, Jill.  Oh, no, no, you guys have it all wrong.  You guys are hysterical.  And I love, like, you talked about it a few weeks ago that Linda Church was dressed in  a turtleneck with pearls on.  Next thing you know, Jill's on.  She's slowly taking off the turtleneck.  The pearls are off.  That is so nice.  She's one of my best friends.  And she's amazing.  She knows we're just messing with her.  I agree she does.  She's so cool.  Now, the thing you guys have gotten into doing where, now, I don't know how this fits into 
[03:07:30]  news, but we look up, you're dancing.  Dance Friday.  Rule.  Round of applause.  Dance Fridays.  Come on.  Dance Fridays.  I'm going, what happened?  We were just watching the news.  Well, it is the news.  Yeah.  Dance Fridays.  Come on.  It's a news station.  We have to dance.  Of course.  Don't you watch the other stations?  Doesn't everyone dance?  No.  And that's just, why do you think we stick to Jill TV?  That's why everyone watches the CW 11, of course. 
[03:08:00]  Or Jill TV.  Fine.  You guys have got to be doing well because of your addition and your bigger profile on  the show now.  I've got to say the ratings have kind of increased lately.  No, the ratings are very...  So what job are you going to take next?  Are you going to do weather or are you going to do entertainment?  They are moving you up.  They are moving you up, sister.  Well, I thought you said I was going to be like the news director soon.  You're pretty much running the place.  As long as more time on camera, more gooder.  No.  Yeah.  I mean, I love... 
[03:08:30]  When you're not on, we go, ah, go to Channel 5.  We really do.  No, we do, though.  All my bosses are listening right now.  Hi, Karen.  Hi, Ahmad.  And you hear that?  We're not even joking.  We root for traffic.  You root for...  Oh, good.  A pileup.  We started laughing.  We're like, who does a seven-minute traffic report in New York?  Well, it's very important.  Unless you're Jill.  It is Manhattan.  You know what's great, though?  When something big does happen on the roads and there's a lot of traffic and you  get all serious.  Yeah, you like that?  No, I have to really report on the George Washington Bridge. 
[03:09:00]  There's like a fatal accident investigation blocking the right lane had an inbound on  the upper level of George Washington Bridge.  Something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're all serious.  It's like, let's take a look at this.  It was...  What's it called?  Friday dance?  Dance Friday.  Dance Friday's abrupt quickly because something serious was happening one Friday.  Oh, yeah.  You had to cut in.  I think it might have been the George Washington dude.  Oh, the guy that was going to jump from the bridge or something.  And you guys in the middle are like, ah, jello shot.  That's right.  Jello shot.  And all of a sudden it's like, oh, excuse me. 
[03:09:30]  We've got to be serious for a second here.  Yeah, you know, so I have to do more of a serious dance on those type of days.  Yeah, it's very...  Maybe slow.  A little slower.  A little ballad maybe.  Yeah.  And I told this story on the air a few times, but I knew of you because of the Islander  games.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm a huge Islander fan.  I had a season ticket holder.  Yeah.  And I used to laugh my ass off.  She would walk through the, you know, the Coliseum and every guy would like freaking almost  break their neck trying to take a look at her and her luscious body.  Oh, no.  And then you would see just all the, uh, their wives and girlfriends with their arms folded 
[03:10:00]  all pissed off.  And she's just oblivious to the whole thing.  Just smelling up.  I'm doing my job.  Entire sections that at once.  I'm doing my job.  The perfume you would wear.  It would just, it would just stay in the section way past you, uh, leaving.  Del Cangabana.  Yeah, it's Del Cangabana.  That's what it is.  Oh.  Can you smell it now?  Is it emanating?  Hold on.  I got to get up.  Come here.  It is.  If you want, if you want the room to smell nice.  Is that the scent?  That's very nice, yes.  Now you can smell like Jill. 
[03:10:30]  And the girl that, uh, replaced you, uh, she might, uh, she might be nice, but she's  a hack.  She's a hack.  Oh, you're so funny.  Traffic hack?  What's a traffic hack?  No, not Channel 11, Lee.  What?  I'm talking the one at the Islander game.  Oh, Dina.  Oh.  Oh, Dina.  Oh, yeah.  The blonde girl.  I want to, yeah, make this clear, because Lisa's going to be, uh, full-time traffic when you  go and do entertainment full-time.  No, I like her.  She's good.  She's good.  I'm talking about the girl that replaced you at the Coliseum.  Her name is Dina. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  Well, she looks a lot better.  She lost a lot of weight.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I am.  Oh, I like her.  She's a sweet girl.  But no, I think she looks great.  As far as her performance, I have not seen her.  I mean, I went to, like, two or three games this year.  But when I go to the game, I don't watch the game.  I'm, you know, in the locker rooms, hanging out, back room, saying hi, socializing to the  fans.  Networking.  Networking.  They call me Networking Nickelini.  If, uh, if, uh, your bosses are listening right now, I have to comment on a few issues 
[03:11:30]  with the news.  Er, er, animal watch.  What the hell is going on with animal watch?  The best.  Come on.  And then the anchor's like, you know, Craig Trevi looks up like, uh, where's the rooster?  Tiffany, where's the rooster?  Yeah.  He cannot be happy doing animal watch.  Any animal story has to start with, uh, the rooster.  He's got to be thinking his, his, like, his, uh, uh, the line of succession to one of the  network anchor positions is way down. 
[03:12:00]  If you're doing the animal watch with the rooster cock-a-doodle-doo noise before, uh, you get  to speak.  Well, sometime you get the, uh, the little crazy cat sound, you know?  Yes.  That's my favorite.  That's my favorite.  I've heard that, too.  Can I do the other one?  I love your animals, uh, the pieces on the animals.  I, I stop dead in my tracks and go, that kitten's adorable.  Thank you.  Get the, the cutest animals on the CW11 news.  Can I do the other one?  Go ahead.  The heat is on.  Oh, it's going to be a hot one. 
[03:12:30]  The heat is on.  They got two hot songs.  The heat is on.  And what's the other one?  Hot time living in the city.  Yeah.  Hot down.  Summer in the city.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, there's a couple other.  What about feeling hot, hot, hot?  Oh, that's a good one.  And then you could do a conga line.  You could do a little conga line to it.  We got the legs.  Yeah.  And the hats and the maracas.  Oh, and then you could do it like a segway, like, well, the traffic's doing a conga line  today.  Look at all these red cars.  Yeah.  We have done that before, actually.  Oh, here it is.  There it is. 
[03:13:00]  Yellow shirt.  Thirsty Thursday.  Thirsty Thursday.  Isn't it thong Thursdays?  Yeah.  It could be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you waiting for?  I got to tell her, Jill, that we used to watch Mike Woods on Channel 5.  Yeah.  Because he is the worst.  And we would play his audio on a regular basis how awful he was.  And then I think one day he was on vacation.  And then I'm like, hey, I remember that chick from the Islanders games. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  And then the rest is history.  Yeah.  We don't watch.  He cannot improvise.  Improvise whatsoever.  He's just, the second he goes to do the weather, he's fine.  He was like, okay, now let me tell you about what's going on.  But they would try to be like, hey, so what did you do last night?  Bye, bye, bye.  Last night, I was sleepy watching TV there.  Well, maybe he was doing things that he didn't want anyone to tell you about him.  He didn't want to tell anyone.  Well, could be.  Maybe I have some inside scoop. 
[03:14:00]  You've heard the same things we've heard, huh?  I don't know.  Also, the girl that does the stocks.  Now, what was her name?  Nicole Padolini's.  Nicole, right?  A few of them, yes.  Is she the one that they go to every morning to do the stock?  Mostly Nicole.  Look, we like her.  Okay.  Very good.  But could you tell her to eat a sandwich?  Oh, my gosh.  That's the consensus.  You've got to eat a sandwich.  I think she's beautiful.  I never met her.  You know, she's always got the stock exchange.  But, yeah, I've heard that before. 
[03:14:30]  She has gotten very thin.  And her name sounds a lot like yours, so we all turn our heads and like, oh, it's the stock girl.  My father calls me Padolini sometimes by accident.  On air, John Muller has called me Jill Padolini before.  They kind of say, yeah, it's that catchy Italian thing, I guess.  Yep.  Not like I'm even fully Italian or anything, but yeah.  What are you, half Italian?  I'm half Italian and Polish, and then a little German, Irish, and French.  Oh, nice.  A mutt.  Nice comment.  Exactly.  With a capital M. 
[03:15:00]  That guy's a huge fan of our show.  I remember you.  Oh, my God.  John Hannafin, he's the best.  He's the one who sends me all your clips.  He's the most dedicated fan and listener we have at this station.  Yeah, we've known him for a while.  That's for sure.  He's looking out for me today.  Like we would ever treat Jill poorly.  She's one of our heroes.  This girl can handle herself.  Exactly.  She's scrapped in many bars on Long Island.  Long Island, forget about it.  Can't run, I have.  Woo-hoo!  Double it up.  Double it back.  Hey, what about Patty McGee's?  Patty McGee's. 
[03:15:30]  Come on.  Montego Bay, baby.  Hey, don't start.  What about Neptunes?  Neptunes.  Remember Neptunes?  You know something?  It's so funny because sometimes you get an impression of a girl and it's totally wrong.  We had you pegged.  We nailed it.  Just because I'm playing along doesn't mean I am a bar party girl.  I'm really not.  No?  I'm the type of girl who likes sitting home, having a glass of wine, dinner.  That's it.  Oh, that's good.  Honestly, I'm not that way.  But occasionally.  Occasionally.  Something tells me maybe like during high school.  During high school?  No, I worked at a radio station for five years. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, at WBLI.  So I was working at that top 40 station in Long Island.  And I had no choice from 19 to like 24.  I had to go to clubs and bars, but I was getting paid.  Do appearances, you get paid.  So you know what?  By the time that I was done, I had no interest in ever going to a bar again.  Because I like going for two hours to get paid, get free drinks, and then leave.  What t-shirt concert?  No, no.  The best was when we would do tattoos.  Then we used to get like the BLI tattoos and then we used to put them on your butt. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  You know, get all the ladies.  Yeah, but did you ever hang out at a gas station and pump $1.02 gas in the afternoon  and hand out roses to the ladies on Valentine's Day?  That I've never done, no.  Thank you.  Part of my VAB days.  I hope you also had to bring lunch to people.  All right.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I'm trying to be cool here.  You'd like coming into the office.  Hi, I'm bringing lunch.  You're like six foot fucking hero, whatever the fuck you want to call them.  Oh, that's great.  Some marine sandwich.  What do they call them all around? 
[03:17:00]  Some of the people don't know who you are, so they just think you're the delivery guy.  Yeah, it was so embarrassing.  Oh, you're the guy on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  And then I'd hear, dude, I listen to you all the time.  What are you doing here?  Like, thanks, dude.  You're doing a lot?  Thanks for blowing on my spot.  It's a cool image on the radio, but I'm actually dishing out lunch.  I'm trying to walk into a big fanfare and they're like, I could just put the sandwich  over there.  Yeah.  Oh, you must be getting recognized a lot, though, now.  I am.  It's really cute.  It's really sweet. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  It's, you know, go out and it's like, that's the Channel 11 girl.  But now I am getting a lot.  That's the Jill TV girl.  Jill.  My space is blowing up with all the O&A fans.  Thank you guys so much.  And please be nice to her.  Of course.  They are nice to me.  People are beating us up because we're not being idiots or something.  I don't get it.  What would we do?  I don't know.  We're having fun.  We love this girl.  Some people come in and we're like, we're supposed to be mean.  This is the nicest I've ever seen you be to anybody that's on the air.  It's Jill.  I'm starstruck. 
[03:18:00]  You're sweet.  Jesus.  It's because she's from Long Island.  Yeah.  It is, too.  We have this camaraderie.  Mom wrestling.  Mom wrestling.  And we love how you, you're the only person that could actually come to work in lingerie.  Yes.  I do that from time to time.  But I think you're getting a little paranoid because you're dressing a little more.  Oh, well, honestly, take a look at the shirt.  Oh, my gosh.  The pin popped out.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes if we show too much, I mean, you know, you want to look good. 
[03:18:30]  But if it's too much, we've got to adjust here.  So the boss is like, we've got to use some tape, some pins today.  I'm like, okay.  Oh, it's a pin day for Jill.  So I bet your bosses have never said no to you.  No, no.  Just try it out.  Go, hey, I want to be behind the anchor desk today.  See what they say.  You got it.  Whatever you want.  Anything for Jill.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  Hurrah, hurrah.  Hurrah, hurrah.  Hurrah, hurrah.  Whatever she wants.  And the boss only wants the pins on because he's the one that pushed them on.  No, no, no.  I think that needs a pin. 
[03:19:00]  Like, this morning, seriously, like, three guys had to help me do that.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, do we really need three men helping me?  The audio guy's like, well, Joe's like, oh, I've got to fix your mic.  I'm like, what has to do with this?  Could you put this up your shirt?  Let me get your mic today.  You guys are fighting over it.  That's my job.  It's the lighting guy.  He's trying to mic you.  Oh, gosh.  I love it, though.  Today is a very, and I noticed when you were on, it's a very, like, retro 60s kind of top  that you have on. 
[03:19:30]  But there are some days, especially your red days, where you're wearing red, where it's like,  she got that at Victoria's Secret or somewhere.  You're wearing a teddy.  There are some things you can wear that are interchangeable to work clothes, you know, corsets  and stuff like that, of course.  She came out of a champagne glass bubble bath, and she's wearing a teddy.  We take your picture every day.  It's on our website.  And what we're amazed at, and it's something.  Oh, there's the one.  That's the one.  That's the one.  We love that one.  That was when Jim was in.  Yes.  Well, what we have noticed, you haven't worn the same outfit twice yet. 
[03:20:00]  Thank goodness.  What the fuck is that about?  That's why I have, like, an addiction to clothes shopping, and that's why I'm in so much debt.  Yes.  I am a shopaholic.  It's official, and I need help.  Anyone out there wants to help, please.  It's probably a little easier shopping out on Long Island than it was in the city.  It's a little more expensive.  And I do both.  I love it.  And, you know, I don't even have a clothing sponsor.  I need one.  Yeah.  We've got to get you one.  Where you go, Roosevelt Field Mall.  Oh, remember that?  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  And we took out America with you, by the way.  We took phone calls like, yeah, do you have a hotter girl in your city? 
[03:20:30]  I heard.  I heard that.  They sent pictures.  They sent links.  And we're like, shut up.  There was a French newswoman that was...  Ooh, let's shut up.  Yeah, we had to go halfway around the world.  Yeah, I don't know where she...  I don't know if we have a picture of her, but she's...  She was a pig.  Let's say...  She didn't shave her armpits.  Oh, then she's done.  Rolled out.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nick in California.  Nick.  Hey, Lone.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Nick.  Hey, Joe, I got a question for you.  Sure, hi, Nick. 
[03:21:00]  Have you ever been to F.H. Riley's in Long Island?  Yeah, have you?  No.  Oh.  Actually, I can tell you, I don't even know where F.H. Riley's is.  Oh, my God.  It's right in the heart of Huntington Village.  You just hurt my soul.  It's on New York Avenue.  Nobody knows that.  I've been to...  I've never been there.  Never been there.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  My brother's restaurant.  You could be the celebrity...  Shut up!  Yes!  Yes!  Or guest bartender, please.  Beaker shots!  How cool would it be to see Joe with the holsters with the bottles in there, and you can just 
[03:21:30]  take it out and pour drinks?  I've done that before, just as a guest bartender, and I don't know what I'm doing, and they're  a bartender today in my life, but I give everyone double the alcohol shots, this, give them  everything they want.  Oh, I bet.  Sure.  I bet they're tipping you like crazy.  They're like, oh, you went through so much alcohol tonight, and you lost money.  You didn't make any.  But keep it up.  You're doing a great job.  So when can I go to this restaurant?  Anytime you want.  Oh my God.  She would just get carte blanche at FH Riley's, yeah.  If you're short of that, that would be huge.  We usually do, every once in a while, late night karaoke.  We go there and just have a blast. 
[03:22:00]  What is it with the Channel 11, the CW News there, that people could just take off?  Like, sometimes you're not there for days.  But you know what it is?  I don't get it.  Do you remember?  Well, it's commuter cast now, what we do.  And back in, last summer, I was supposed to move out of the helicopter into the studio.  And that didn't happen until this January.  So we were waiting for the switch, and we were getting Lisa ready to come to the helicopter.  I was going to the studio, but it took so long.  And they said, well, don't take off.  It's going to be next week.  No, it's going to be next week.  It's going to be next week.  So therefore, I spent like five months not able to take any vacation. 
[03:22:30]  And now, I have to take all my vacation before August, like, 15.  Oh, so you kind of take a few days here and there.  Yeah, yeah.  What's a vacation like for you?  What do you do?  Where do you go?  Oh, gosh.  I do everything.  A lot of times, I sleep.  Every Sunday, I went to California two weeks, three weeks ago.  And I was off this past Thursday because I was at Thirsty Thursdays.  And, you know, is there really a place called Thirsty Thursdays?  There has to be.  It's Long Island.  There's a new Mulcahy's, though, in Center Reach.  Is there?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:23:00]  And I think they bring a bull there every now and then.  A little ride in the bull.  Never done it.  Not yet.  Bull riding.  I could see it on one of the segments where it's like, we're here with Jill.  She's going to be bull riding today.  And that would be bull riding.  But it's mechanical.  A bunch of guys show up with bull masks.  Oh, no.  You got a cousin named Rob?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Rob, hi.  From Jersey.  Hey, Jill.  Hi, Rob.  How are you?  How you doing?  I'm so glad you got through.  I'm doing what?  What are the chances that she shows up at the Holmdale show? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  That'd be awesome.  I'll give her all access.  We got a commie tour that we're taking around the country.  Yeah, I know.  I would love to.  Yeah.  PNC, baby.  If you're not busy, you have August 25th.  Invite.  Believe me.  How do we not know that?  What is it?  August 25th.  You could, like, bring out Jimmy before he does his thing.  I'm in like Flynn.  And, Rob, I guess that means you have to come with me, right?  Yeah, that might happen.  That might be good.  Oh, I see.  Dude, how much does it suck to have this hot a cousin?  It's your cousin.  The whole family's hot. 
[03:24:00]  Our sister Jen is pretty.  The mom Michelle's pretty.  And don't even get me started on cousin Anthony.  That's my brother.  And cousin Monique, your wife.  Oh, my gosh.  Very protective brother?  No.  No?  No, my brother's like my biggest fan.  He always calls when he wants something.  He's like, hey, I need an autograph.  Hey, could you come here?  Hey, but he's proud of me.  Yeah.  Your father, though, looks like he could scrap.  Wait, have you ever seen my father? 
[03:24:30]  I think so.  He's Speedo Man.  He's been on our show, Channel 11.  Literally, I flew over the house in a helicopter.  And he was in his Speedos.  And he was swimming.  This was live on here.  Yeah, this was on the CW 11 morning news.  Yeah, we had him jump.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're going to do it again.  So I'll make sure I let you know.  He's all hairy.  And he's, like, really gross.  But I love him.  And he's, like, the mayor of the whole town.  He's so popular.  But it's this guy.  He walks, like, with his back like this.  Because, you know, he delivers the papers for the Post, like, all his life. 
[03:25:00]  So his back's crooked.  And he's, like, they call him cheap broken back.  And he walks.  If you guys can, like, see how I'm trying to walk.  And it doesn't look so good.  But he walks like this.  And, yeah, he's just a character.  Oh, my God.  You are so Long Island, man.  Do I have a Long Island accent?  No, not really.  Not your voice.  Just how you present yourself.  Long Island chicks.  That's actually a compliment.  Yeah, it really is.  I thought Long Island chicks were supposed to be, like, Jersey chicks.  Like, curly hair.  Well, that's the stereotypical one.  Like, the nameplate.  Like, Julian or whatever. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Going out with the guy, the Guido that drives the IROC.  Uh-huh.  Like, Anthony's Princess.  Get in the car.  Get in the car, Maria.  Get in the car.  Get in the Camaro.  Get in.  Everyone's asking, how hot is she?  What do you think?  Do you hear us gushing over here?  Oh.  They got her on every...  They're trying to fit her into every aspect of a news program.  Right.  Possible.  Go to our website.  I'm waiting for you to be down on Wall Street.  Go to opianapity.com.  I don't know.  Just buy something or sell something. 
[03:26:00]  All right, Jill.  Thank you for that stock report.  Look, I have my master's degree.  I graduated student cum laude at 3.92.  I am...  I was a geek.  And as a smart girl, I wanted to be a doctor.  And I went to Stony Brook University two years.  And then when I got the job working radio, I loved it.  So I said, okay, mom, sorry, not being a doctor anymore.  I want to, like, just be personable and...  Were your parents cool about that?  Oh.  They supported you?  Oh, so cool.  Yeah.  They loved it.  And then they got free concert tickets to Jones Beach.  Concerts here was all summer.  Of course they loved it.  And that was a dream for us. 
[03:26:30]  Our comedy tour played Jones Beach.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  To be standing on that stage, it was unbelievable being from Long Island.  Yeah.  Coming from Long Island.  Yeah.  I've seen so many shows there.  Pretty cool.  And, you know, Nassau Coliseum.  Of course.  Going there.  That place needs a little overhaul.  Oh, that needs a major overhaul.  Oh, jeez.  And when the scoreboard fell down...  Oh, gosh.  That's right.  That place might need a little bit of an overhaul.  And then they got rid of my boy, Jason Blake.  I'm just like...  Aw, you like Jason Blake?  I don't think I'm getting tickets this year.  Yeah, I know.  I just saw Carol off this morning at the station.  Yeah.  We were talking about Alexei, because, you know, he's gone now to Russia. 
[03:27:00]  And...  She knows.  And everyone's leaving.  She knows.  Yes.  Islander talk with Jill McElhinney.  There's still some good players.  Come on.  Sean Bates is one of my good friends, so he's a good guy.  I like Sean Bates.  He's a good player, right?  Garth is doing a good job.  Garth is doing great.  Mm-hmm.  What about...  God, I know everything.  Why are you laughing?  Oh.  Okay.  Okay, good.  Is that it?  I was just going to ask.  Use the date, Garth Snow.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  Okay.  I was just going to ask a little bit about, maybe a little bit about your romantic life. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, look at this.  A little bit about that.  Is there a gentleman?  Yes, there is.  I met someone three and a half months ago.  Three and a half months ago.  Mm-hmm.  He's...  I met a...  The news director at Channel 11.  Oh, no.  Jesus.  Hello.  What are you implying?  No.  News director...  A woman, please.  But, no, I do...  I knew you were right behind me, Jimmy.  I rushed that one out.  You guys are so bad.  So, wait.  This guy you met, now, did he see you on television and all of a sudden he meets you and he's like, 
[03:28:00]  wow, I'm going to ask her out?  No, he never saw me on television, actually.  He's from Massachusetts.  Is he in a local Long Island band?  Like you all?  Come on.  No.  Exactly.  No, I met him on a movie set.  He wrote a movie called Order of Redemption a few months ago and I was a reporter in the film  and that's how I met him.  Wow.  So, right now he's in L.A. editing the film and so I'll go back to see him soon and vice  versa.  That's great.  A little long distance.  A little long distance romance.  We're all going, that's great as we silently cry and we'll show up.  We're happy for you. 
[03:28:30]  Hope it...  Godspeed.  I see.  I see what you're doing.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh.  Well, let's talk about your relationships.  Talk about the ladies in your life.  Oh, come on.  I've been with a lovely girl for eight years.  Oh, look at you.  Eight years.  You're so good.  I'm up to three years.  Three years?  Very happy.  Jim?  I'm up to eight months and before I hit a year, I'm sure something that happens at my girlfriend  will cross the desk.  It will.  CW 11.  In custody, Jim Norton. 
[03:29:00]  No, that's good.  I'm happy.  Oh, God.  Three months.  How sweet.  It is.  It's sweet.  It's all lovey-dovey.  What was that before that?  How long was your relationship?  Before the...  Oh, gosh.  I was in a relationship for six months, and then before that, it was like a year, then  like three and a half years.  Jump around a little bit.  But you know what it is?  I wanted to be single and do the right thing and just find myself.  I found myself.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I can't help it.  I don't go out looking for someone.  I always meet a friend through a friend, or it's always someone I know.  I never go out to Thursday Thursdays and meet men. 
[03:29:30]  Never pick up men at clubs.  Do these things end because of your career?  Maybe you're a little busy, or is it like...  A lot of times, there's a lot of...  Guys are a little possessive, jealous.  Yeah.  I think that's what it is.  So I need a man who's really strong, confident, and it doesn't matter what you look like.  Honestly, you could be ugly.  You could be hot.  It doesn't matter.  Just someone with a good personality that matters.  Like a comedian, or you know...  Like a comedian.  A best-selling author.  Maybe just wrote a great book.  Yeah.  Just as long as he's willing to stay home while you stay out all night. 
[03:30:00]  No.  I'd want you right by my side all the time.  Beer funnels!  I need someone to hold my bag.  I would be the best mall boyfriend.  So does Jim.  Oh my God, would you?  Would you?  While you shopped, I would hold your purse and just go, it's you!  It's perfect!  I'll buy it for you.  Oh my God, I love you.  That's what I need.  I need a man who likes to shop.  That's the only problem with my boyfriend.  Hey, we should have found this.  Did he give you an Amex, your boyfriend?  No, not yet, but he better soon.  That's...  You know something? 
[03:30:30]  And it better be the black card.  The three-month mark is where the girl should get the Amex.  Oh, I'm working on it.  I'm working on it.  What are you keeping here?  Oh, that's so heavy.  Oh.  Oh my gosh.  Pass it around.  Feel how heavy it is, everyone.  Feel how heavy her bag is.  Let's guess the weight.  God.  Wow.  Whoa.  What could possibly be in there?  You know?  Oh, by the way...  This isn't a cheapo...  No.  No, that's no coach bag.  It's also humming.  Oh, it's vibrating.  There better be a phone!  Oh, look at you!  Yeah.  No bringing toys to work, boys. 
[03:31:00]  You know...  No.  Okay, let's see.  No, it's just a text message.  Oh, it's a call.  Oh, it's a call from my jewelry designer.  Hi, Deb.  Oh.  Can't go.  I'm busy on air.  Okay.  You guys are busy on air.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  My sister's listening, and my PR lady's listening.  Oh, great.  Thank you, guys.  Are you getting a lot of people that want you to endorse things?  Clothing, jewelry, things like that?  Well, I have a jewelry designer.  She's wonderful.  Deb's beautyinthebeads.com.  But no, I need clothes, so let's get Jill out of the shopping habit.  I would think people, like companies, would be all over you to dress you and clothes. 
[03:31:30]  You know, Jill's clothing is sponsored by at the end of the news.  You can do that.  There's a few people out there who offered recently, so I've got to go meet with them  and see.  Ah, nice.  See?  You're working it.  Well, you guys should have filmed this for Channel 11.  This would have been a great segment.  Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm inviting myself back already, and we'll do it on a day that it's  a vacation day, so I can spend the whole day here with you guys, starting at 6.  She misses radio.  I got it already planned.  I do miss radio.  And we'll bring the whole camera crew in, and then we'll do a little package on it, and 
[03:32:00]  That'd be cool.  It'd be great.  We're in.  Wait, we've got to get a picture of her next to Jill TV.  That's good.  Oh, absolutely.  I would love to.  All right, we've got to let her...  Gee, is Maury doing, is it your baby?  So Jill Nicolini from Channel 11 here in New York.  Jill.  Oh.  I got kids.  Oh, I got kids.  Oh, hold on.  Oh, kids.  I'm sorry.  Oh, hold on.  I got...  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's not for you.  It's Jimmy's birthday, you slouch.  Oh.  All right, well, make sure...  I mean, let me tell you what happened.  My cab ride here was ridiculous. 
[03:32:30]  We had no AC.  The car was overheating, and the guy was just...  I think he had Tourette's.  He was, like, cursing.  Oh, my God.  And the traffic.  So I got so hungry.  I was in the car for an hour.  I ate some of someone's M&M's.  Oh, my God.  So open it up.  You got some.  CW11 M&M's.  I had to.  You were a red car.  Oh.  You were one of the red cars.  I was a red car.  Exactly.  CW M&M's.  Pens.  What do you got there, Opie?  We got some swag from Channel 11.  What is that?  Oh, good.  I still got some M&M's.  What is that?  I love M&M's.  I have green CW M&M's.  Oh, I got a hat. 
[03:33:00]  And some pens.  Oh.  What is this CW11 hat?  And honestly, I don't even get these things.  This is great.  You got to be friends with Opie and Anthony for them to send down stuff from the 10th floor.  Very cool, man.  This is cool.  A bunch of green M&M's, Channel 11.  I like this.  This is a gigabyte thing here.  It's like a little computer thing.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Hey, how did this get in here?  Linda Church's resume.  Oh, thank you.  That's me.  Wait, hold on.  And it has something special for the birthday boy.  Oh, it's something you do on Wednesdays, right?  It's like a butt-rubbing Wednesday thing.  Oh, God.  I thought we were talking about the other thing. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, I don't know.  But, yeah, I know what you do.  Oh, my God.  Your heart stopped mine, dude.  Take a look at these.  Oh, my God.  These are like silicone button implants.  I saw them doing this on the news, on your news show.  I'm going to throw one at you, and they hurt.  Oh, God.  That's kind of hurt.  See?  She's got an arm on her.  Yeah, okay.  She doesn't fuck around, man.  Yes, what do you think?  Hold on a second.  They've never been used. 
[03:34:00]  Get them off your face.  These are nice.  Why don't you try them on and let me know how they...  It feels like...  Those are...  If you have a flat butt, you put those in your underwear or your pants or something, I guess,  and they make you...  Well, of course, you think so.  You don't need those.  But it's going to feel like you have a load in your pants.  These do feel kind of odd.  How does that feel?  Well, why don't you put them in your pants?  Well, it doesn't go there, Opie.  It doesn't go where you would have...  It goes on each cheek.  I understand, but it's going to fall down, and then it's going to feel like you made  beauty in your pants. 
[03:34:30]  Adhesive.  Oh, I see.  It is...  You know, how disappointing is that for a guy, though?  You go to the bar, you bring a girl home, and you've got to peel color forms off her  butt.  Especially if she pushes them on backwards, and then you look like you just have fat thighs.  I have a line that would...  I have no doubt would kill, but she would never come back.  No, don't do it.  No.  Okay.  Don't.  We want Jill to come back.  And it's not at your expense, by the way.  We love Jill.  I'll say it to the boys after.  Yeah, wait.  You just wait until we're in the elevator. 
[03:35:00]  For once in my stupid career, I'm showing restraint.  Let's try to make and keep friends here.  I understand.  These actually feel weird.  Like, when you bend them a certain way, it's like...  I guess if it's just for a temporary...  It feels like ripply material.  It doesn't feel like skin or anything.  I don't know.  I think there might be, like, silicone there or something.  I'm not sure.  It looks like a chicken cutlet.  Like, oh, hence, I brought these two for you.  Chicken cutlets?  Just in case you ever wanted to...  Yeah.  These are actually from the station.  Oh, okay.  These are very sticky. 
[03:35:30]  These are very sticky.  So they would stick to your butt cheek.  I guess.  I've never tried them.  I just have no intention.  Ooh, boobies.  Ew.  Put them on, Jimmy.  Yeah, put on the boobies.  Put on the...  Put on the implant.  I think you need a bra.  I need to get them off.  Oh, you need a...  Do they stick?  Does anyone have a bra for him?  Yeah, just put...  No, those don't stick.  Great.  It looks like a pancreas.  It does.  This is awful.  This is an awful thing to have.  Uh-oh.  But I'm compelled to just rub it.  I know.  It's so smooth.  No, honestly, they make great... 
[03:36:00]  I used to always, like, have fights at my brother-in-law and just throw them at his face.  Come here.  You could...  It hurts.  This thing could hurt.  That does hurt.  Ow!  She's throwing at Opie.  He's nuts.  He's throwing half an ass at Opie.  Right.  Hey, uh, we gotta let Gina Lynn and Travis, uh, leave.  Oh, yes.  Let's say hello.  Oh, you guys.  And, uh, they gave us unbelievable radio before Joe came in, too.  I mean, it's been a great, great day.  They gave us a killer hour.  GinaLynn.com.  She's got a monster...  You don't have a monster truck. 
[03:36:30]  What?  She's got a monster truck.  No, I do not.  Talk to me.  Did you see the video with them, too?  No, I did not.  Oh, oh, oh, us.  It's clean.  Yes.  It was called Survive This.  It was a movie that we did in, like, 2002.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And it was hysterical.  And then all of a sudden...  It's on YouTube.  GinaLynn.  GinaLynn, that's my bathing suit.  And, uh...  Yeah, it is, right?  You borrowed it.  Wow.  And so they wanted to do a...  It's a movie about, like, celebrities, like the naked cowboy was in it, and a few other  people, all trapped on an island. 
[03:37:00]  And that's when I met GinaLynn and her husband, and they wanted to do, like, a little dream  sequence, like, um, two sexy girls fighting on the beach.  Well, they got it.  You know, rubbing feet and...  You know what's funny?  You're fighting in one second, and then the next, you're kind of cuddling with each other.  It was nice.  Kind of here, right?  Please tell me at the end of the movie, you all get together and break that guitar over  the naked cowboy.  Yes, we did.  Yes.  Please tell me that's how it ends.  Yes.  GinaLynn, Monster Truck, today at the Orange County Fair in Middletown, New York.  Like, 3 to 10 p.m. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  And thank you for...  You guys have got to come back.  Yeah.  Get some clothes on.  Great stories.  Yeah, it was really...  It was fun.  Get some clothes on.  Why?  Yeah.  Keep New York beautiful and stay just like that.  Yeah.  Thank goodness.  She would stop traffic out there right now.  Oh, I know.  Hey, Travis, a pleasure, man.  We'll see you again.  Gina, thank you so much.  Bye.  Shake that hand.  Just wonder where it's been.  Dirty French girl.  I don't know.  They were great.  They had some great stories. 
[03:38:00]  There are some...  I heard, yeah.  People were calling me to let me know what was happening, so...  Yeah.  Well, this is really cool.  We didn't think you would be allowed to come here.  Oh, no.  I'm so glad to be...  Just because you're doing the highbrow thing and all that.  No.  Everyone at the station loves you.  We get a bad reputation at times, you know.  At times.  But we all do.  It's okay.  I think you've shown some of our footage over the years.  But we've tried to be on our best behavior.  Yes.  Absolutely.  We make the news every so often.  We just want to look at the news one time and go, wow, they're actually reporting on 
[03:38:30]  something...  Something good.  Something nice we did.  It ain't going to happen.  It never happened.  What kind of cake is that?  Do you know?  I have no idea.  It's a cock cake.  Why don't you take a bite?  I bought the Fudgy the Whale ice cream cake from Carvel.  Such a Long Island cake, by the way.  But DC would not let me bring it in.  I had to bring the...  Is there an ice cream cake out there?  Yes.  I want a bite of the ice cream cake.  Absolutely.  Fudgy the Whale.  I like the vanilla, you can have the chocolate, and I want the crunchies.  I like the ice cream cake actually better.  That's what I...  I know Steve Seed did...  I know he hooked something up, because he had a boxy this morning, and he wouldn't let 
[03:39:00]  me look at it.  That was it.  Well, this went great.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Jill, thanks so much for coming in.  I'm like...  I'm starstruck.  Oh, you're so sorry.  Thank you.  I need a picture so bad.  Do you have your camera, Jimmy?  We're going to get pictures again.  He doesn't do pictures.  Hey.  Oh, stop it.  I do, too.  Hey.  I didn't get a birthday hat, though.  Can I have a birthday hat?  Yes.  Right over there.  That's not fair.  Go, go, go.  Let's do this.  Maybe, you know, maybe...  Yeah, put on the birthday hat, Jimmy.  Or the birthday hug.  I don't want to wear a birthday hat.  You have to.  You have to.  It's your birthday. 
[03:39:30]  Did you guys all sing to him already?  They did.  Oh, yeah.  We gave him a big happy birthday.  It looks silly in there.  Oh, Jill's putting her birthday hat on.  Of course he is.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Too many Jell-O shots, guys.  I'm going to say birthday, mate.  I feel silly in my birthday hat.  You look terrific.  You look adorable.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jill on the way out to the Mad Hatter of Stony Brook, hanging out of the sunroof of a limo.  The Mad Hatter.  Woo!  Park bench! 
[03:40:00]  Yeah!  It's a park bench, baby.  I do know that one.  I think I was 15 when I went in there, actually.  Oh, yeah.  I probably gave you a B.A.V. bumper sticker then.  You sure did.  Oh, my goodness.  Back in the day.  Yeah.  Park bench.  Oh, Jimmy, you don't look happy with your happy birthday hat on.  Oh, no.  Jimmy.  You can't be happy in this hat.  You'll look silly.  You'll look good.  The elastic right now, you guys can't see, but it's just digging ever so deeply into his  cute little cheeks and chin.  I know.  Everything in nature is trying to make it a noose. 
[03:40:30]  Jimmy, I think it looks sexy.  Oh.  Oh.  That's nice.  Keep it on, then.  I think your girlfriend might like it.  You should wear it when you go home.  Oh, no.  She had an accident, the poor girl.  Oh, I know.  This afternoon, she had one, and about two hours from now.  Oh, the poor girl.  I'm going to miss her.  God bless her.  Well, time to move on.  You're an awful man, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  It's a...  Well, are you guys going to hug her?  Yeah.  I don't want to know.  She's a news person.  So, how long it's your birthday? 
[03:41:00]  We need a...  Oh, yeah.  No, you're right.  I hugged you last week at the CW.  All right.  Come on.  Throws his headphones away.  Aw.  Look at that.  Am I taller than you?  Ooh.  Am I taller than you?  Yeah.  That's what a guy wants to hear.  She did the nice...  Aw.  Hold on.  Get a kiss on the cheek.  It's so cute.  What are you doing with the camera?  You're shooting Obie's forehead.  He's so mad.  Aw.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Oh, boy.  So, you had good surprises this morning for your birthday? 
[03:41:30]  That was the best.  Oh, yeah.  This is like one of the best birthday parties any of us have had in studio.  And it's for Jimmy.  That's the weird thing, because he celebrates his birthday 200 days out of the year.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Isn't it his birthday?  He's selfish and greedy.  But, and then, you know...  His birthday greed.  And then we have to convince people that it's actually his birthday, which is...  Mm-hmm.  Jill just smells good.  Yeah.  That's the smell from the Islander game.  Islander fans agree.  Oh, you sound good.  She's lovely.  Thank you, Eric.  Sorry I've scolded you before and called you stupid and humiliated. 
[03:42:00]  Smack him with one of those butt cutlets.  He'll probably eat it.  Of course he will.  Those things make great weapons.  Forget about carrying mace, ladies.  Get yourself a set of those.  A butt cutlet.  It's like a sap.  It's like an old time, like, you just whack someone across the face with it.  What a dope I am.  I kept my hat on longer than I had to.  Did you?  What a fool.  Like, I'm trying to have a conversation.  I'm putting my headphones back on.  I'm like, oh, your hat.  Stupid.  The picture's great that you just took with Jill leaning over and kissing on the cheek, 
[03:42:30]  but you do have the hat on.  Oh.  You do have the hat on?  Well, and they'll be photoshopping out.  Yeah, photoshop those out.  It's like, no, we were just hanging out.  Oh, man.  Like, photoshop you both out and put you in a club somewhere.  It looks like she showed up at my party, like, because I'm a special boy.  Make-a-wish foundation.  She's a local.  I do.  A lot of charity work.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The personality kisses the special boy on the cheek.  Special boy.  He's a sweet boy.  Oh, my God. 
[03:43:00]  It does.  This could be the saddest photograph.  I'm going to say.  Look how sad that picture is.  It's sad.  You are so right.  Hold on.  Pass it down.  That is a sad picture.  Post that immediately.  Oh, God.  Let me look again.  I didn't look.  I didn't look.  Oh.  You look cute.  You could figure out how much you make per hour and deduct the time it's spent to take  that picture on your taxes for charity.  That's how sad that picture is. 
[03:43:30]  It's a sideway kiss, and she's kind of kissing and looking straight ahead, like, as soon as the  flash comes back, I'm out of here.  Yeah, my lips off his cheek.  Oh, what a creep.  Did they start the picture?  Oh, thank God.  That's funny.  I think we covered it all.  Yes, what a day.  What a day.  Look at that.  You'd think we just met in a club.  Now, that's a happy picture.  Let me see that one.  People are going to think that.  I know.  One without the hat.  No, we have our hats on, of course.  Of course. 
[03:44:00]  Why would you not?  Look at us.  We're just like a couple.  Is there another sad?  Oh, that's a good one.  Hold on.  I'm moving along.  Oh, is that sad?  That's a fine photograph.  Just a couple of party people out on the town.  Oh, that is so sad.  You're with a dumb hat.  Oh, God.  Jill, are you working tomorrow?  Yes, I am.  Is it Dance Friday tomorrow?  Oh, guess what?  I'm doing entertainment, so there's no Dance Friday. 
[03:44:30]  Of course you are.  Oh, gosh.  They're grooming you.  But you know what?  Next time I do it, you guys have a request for a song, and I'll dedicate it to you.  Hey, do we get a shout-out tomorrow?  Of course you do.  And by the way, you got a great shout-out the day that Jim was there, you know?  I know.  I know that.  Yeah.  And I mentioned that you guys are awesome.  Jill TV.  We stopped our radio show to watch Jimmy on TV.  Hey, when are you going to be doing traffic again?  Next Monday.  So Sunday night, we encourage everybody to not sleep and then drive horribly Monday  morning.  Yes, please.  That means more time.  The more wrecks, the better. 
[03:45:00]  Remember, red lights are for sissies.  Plow through them.  Someone just start throwing tacks on the long-hour expressway.  Something.  Nails and bouncy balls.  Well, Jill, it has been a pleasure having you here.  Thank you.  What a day.  What a great birthday for Jimmy.  And thank everybody at CW11.  I actually did have a great day.  They all say hello, especially to Konya.  And I remembered you, bro.  I want to just point that out.  He was really cool to us when we were on CW11 doing an interview.  I guess when we came back to radio, was it? 
[03:45:30]  It was something.  It's either when we're coming or going.  That's when we get pressed on our way in or out.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Are we done?  Are we doing a break?  Yeah, we're doing a break.  Taking a phone call.  Okay.  We might be talking to Al Roker next.  I got a little voiceover work to do later.  What are you doing, Anthony?  It's a secret.  What?  It's a secret.  It's a secret.  That's all I'm saying.  Okay.  It's a secret. 
[03:46:00]  Grand Theft Auto?  Shut up.  What?  What are you doing?  What time?  I'm not saying anything.  How much money are you making?  Good money.  It's in the tens of dollars.  I do voices.  All right.  What are you wearing tomorrow?  I don't know.  You guys want to help me pick out my outfit?  Let's end the interview with a little preview.  You guys can help me pick out an outfit for tomorrow.  We can do that for sure.  No, it can be funny.  Actually, you take pictures of yourself in like three or four outfits, and then we have 
[03:46:30]  the listeners go to our website, and they pick the outfit that you wear on TV.  Absolutely.  I think that's a great idea.  How are we going to do that?  Let me suggest something.  Sure, guys.  I see a hat.  I'm going to wear this.  And shoes.  Yep.  And a glove.  A glove.  A glove.  Hat, shoes, and a glove.  That's what I see.  No, I need to wear a nice top and skirt or a dress.  No, don't be silly.  No, no.  Just...  All right, we're just babbling now.  She's getting very popular for her clothing.  Jill TV is alive and well on OP&A. 
[03:47:00]  Yes, it is.  Jill, Nicolini from Long Island.  Love you guys.  Thank you so much.  No, thank you.  That was great.  CW11, you guys can catch her most mornings.  You're doing the traffic in New York.  And the MySpace page.  What is it?  Oh, it's Jill Nicolini.  Or JillNicolini.com.  How many L's in Nicolini?  Oh, it's N-I-C-O-L-I-N-I.  And I did notice a little bit of an error on your website.  Because it was N-I-C-O-L-L.  One of the Jill TV.  Have them killed.  Have them killed.  Who's responsible for that?  Someone needs a spanking.  It might be stupid E-Rock. 
[03:47:30]  Who's getting spanked today?  E-Rock.  What?  What happened?  N-I-C-O-L-I-N-I.  I told you how to spell Nicolini.  Is everyone still throwing the butt things around?  Look at that.  Butt at them.  Throw half an ass at the complete ass.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We might be here.  I guess we have to stick around for Al Roker.  Yes, we do.  Another sexy news personality.  It's kind of let down after Jill Nicolini.  Let's be honest with each other.  I don't think he's going to get the same treatment Jill did. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, no.  I know.  It would be funny if he brought a cake in, too, and we hung out.  He was wearing the same outfit.  We fell in love with him.  One cake for himself, one for everybody else.  Oh, he's lost a lot of weight.  Thank you very much, Jill.  Thanks for my birthday cake and for my birthday butt cheeks.  Love you all.  Thank you.  And to the gang that came with you.  Yes, my PR guy, Adam, and my biatch, I call him.  That's John.  He does everything for me.  He carries the cats and the bags.  PR guy.  The easiest job in the business right now. 
[03:48:30]  Isn't it, Adam?  Jill is blown up.  Do you assist Jill?  Yeah, he got me.  I did that.  Remember the ESPN boxing event that I did over at Chip Yanni's?  And we invited you all to come.  Next time you're coming.  It's September, what, like 7th?  Yeah, please.  We'll get our own table and rock and roll.  Absolutely.  And do Jell-O show.  Exactly.  I lost my voice because of that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Norton and faggot show.  That's what we should call it, program.  I know how to handle cock. 
[03:49:00]  All my cocks got in.  iPods.  Corn on the cob.  Smoothies.  Egg white omelets.  Bagels and seltzer.  Never.  Starbucks apple cake.  Absolutely.  And rollerblading.  White cocks.  Black cocks.  Two fruits.  Two, two fruits.  I know how to handle cock.  Not only do I know how to handle cocks, I love doing it. 
[03:49:30]  Bye, Jill.  Jill Nicolini.  Leave him in the studio.  Oh, man, you should hear her talk when the mics aren't on.  Now I can fucking talk how I usually talk.  Oh, my God.  What a potty mouth.  He's perfect for XM.  How cool was that?  She was great, man.  She was very, uh, she's got a great personality. 
[03:50:00]  She's very, uh, her energy is really good.  You know, it's like you can't not feel good talking to her.  She's just a nice person.  Yeah.  She's really a sweetheart.  Absolutely.  What a great birthday, uh, for you, Jimmy.  It was fun.  I thank you guys.  You always make it very nice for me.  Jill Nicolini comes in.  That was great.  Uh, I was happy to have Gina come in.  It was good.  Yeah.  They were fantastic.  What a couple of, uh,  great people and what a filthy guy he is.  I've always wanted to talk more to the porn guys because even though, like, this is what  I like about these two.  They didn't try to crack corny porn jokes. 
[03:50:30]  They were just interesting.  They were being a real couple.  Had good stories.  Yes.  They weren't trying to be funny.  Knew how to tell them right.  It was just funny because the story itself was a funny story.  I love those guys.  Yeah.  It wasn't like, oh, here's a funny story.  Let me tell you.  It's just a story to them.  To everyone else, it's hysterical.  You shoot something into your dick and it doesn't go away.  That was great.  Your heart doesn't go away.  Wow.  That was great.  Uh, let's say hi to Adam in Connecticut.  We got lines of the day?  Yes.  Uh, Adam.  Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey. 
[03:51:00]  Hey, just wanted to say the show was great today.  I laughed, I cried, it was better than cats.  Meow.  You're a good boy.  I remember that commercial.  Well, one guy in his feedback didn't like that last segment.  I don't believe it.  How could you not enjoy that?  That's what amazes me about this show.  There's times when, ah, whatever.  What's his name?  He's like, thank God she's finally out of there.  Like, that was really good radio.  Who would say that?  That's just really good radio.  That guy, and I don't, this might be a little inappropriate, but that guy is full of bunk. 
[03:51:30]  Wow, Jimmy.  I don't like to get harsh.  It's a wow.  And of course, can I have a CD of my Aussie things?  That was the greatest gift.  That was amazing.  Oh, Jimmy.  Um, all right.  Thank you.  I would love to listen to that later.  Which one do you want to hear again?  Uh, how about, I think this was the final one.  The final one?  Yeah.  Well, we'll do both again.  Okay.  Hey, we wanted to do the, uh, Catcher, uh, To Catch a Predator audio again, but we're  running out of show.  Yeah.  We'll do it tomorrow. 
[03:52:00]  Because everyone has feedback.  Did he play it?  Did he play it?  So obviously they tuned in a little late.  Yes, we played it.  One of our guys.  Well, one of our fans.  One of our guys.  Yeah.  Well, well, well, well, one of.  Producer for the O.B. and Anthony show.  A guy that may have listened to our show a time or two, uh, was on To Catch a Predator  last night with Chris Hansen.  Oops.  So listen to the replay if you haven't heard it yet.  Hi, Jim, you fucking asshole.  It's me, Ozzy.  Happy birthday.  And I have many more to come.  God bless you.  Stay safe.  I'll see you when I see you.  That right there.  That sounds like a message from a pal. 
[03:52:30]  It doesn't it?  Because it's me, Ozzy.  Yeah.  That's like a friend.  It's not like, you know, yeah, I got to do this for this guy.  I think at this point he finally knows who you are.  I really do.  Yeah.  There's some recognition the last time he was in here.  Yeah.  And he also.  Much like President Ford knew who Squeaky Frog was.  Oh, how true.  But I would never hurt Ozzy.  Of course not.  I would even laugh if he tripped down the steps of Air Force One.  I would hold him up.  No, but it's.  I think I think he might at this point. 
[03:53:00]  I know Sharon does.  Because we were very nice to run.  We treated it great.  And I think the band does.  It's wonderful.  I'm eating some Jill Nicolini M&M's.  They're wonderful.  I had something to say I can't remember.  Oh, let's not forget.  Jill Nicolini basically said she'll be at the PNC Center when we do our comedy show August 25th.  How cool would it be to have her come out on stage?  The crowd would go fucking bullshit.  They will go bullshit.  She's just great.  We got to get something special for her to do.  Even her breath.  That show is good.  Yeah.  She has nice breath.  Oh, dude.  We took pictures after we got off the air and we're all kind of like, I'm just kind of hiding our breath. 
[03:53:30]  Talk out of the corner of my mouth.  I wasn't sure if I.  You chewed gum.  I know.  You're smart.  I wasn't sure if I got everything out of my food pocket.  No.  I didn't want to take a chance.  Food pocket breath.  Stupid dentist telling me to have a food pocket.  Now I got major paranoia.  I'm cleaning that fucking thing out left and right now.  You should be.  You don't want FPB.  I'm drinking coffee and eating eggs and steak and fruit.  Just oatmeal.  It's just like, I can only imagine what it smells like. 
[03:54:00]  It's spilling out like a cornucopia.  Hef this crap is getting jammed into my food pocket.  Great Sabbath song.  Ah.  Here's the other get.  Cornucopia.  Here's the other get.  It's, uh, he was pointing to, uh, what, what, he, oh, okay.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Uh, following for Jim Norton and, and to wish him a very happy fucking birthday.  Have a great time.  I wish I was there to enjoy the fun with you, but we'll meet again soon. 
[03:54:30]  God bless you.  Stay safe.  Happy birthday once more.  Oh, by the way, Jim, you know, Opie and Anthony, they really fucking suck, man.  That sucks, man.  I got so excited when he goes, oh, Opie and Anthony, like, he was going to say something  cool.  We were just sitting on the edge of our seats, hoping against hope.  Oh, I love it.  What did he say about me?  You fucking asshole.  Yeah.  That's, that's fucking better than, than, than, that's affectionate.  I was, I was just kind of going with the thing for the air, Jim.  When he saw the fucking Sabbath picture, uh, with me and with them, he looked at it and 
[03:55:00]  he's looking, he's like, oh man, who's this fucking asshole in the middle?  And I was like, that's me, Ozzy.  I was so happy.  Who's this fucking asshole?  Yeah, he's a fucking clown, man.  He's a funny dude.  Yeah.  But there's only one other thing, uh, to do before we do one of the day or talk to  Al Roker.  What's that, sweetie?  My legs are shitty.  Oh.  My legs are shitty from your asshole.  My legs are shitty.  My legs are shitty from your asshole. 
[03:55:30]  Oh.  Say you won't blow me, I get it in your face.  Say you only take the cock in your dirty face. 
[03:56:00]  And now I'm all filthy.  There's jewelry on my dick.  It looks just like a black man's, but not quite as thick.  Your cooling needs a diaper.  Cause I'm in your cold and blue.  Down in dirty hand, but am I so shitty?  My dick's so shitty from your asshole. 
[03:56:30]  My dick's so shitty.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Dick's so shitty.  I'm getting yelling.  My dick's so shitty from your asshole.  Oh.  You gotta appreciate the passion.  Yeah.  Behind his lyrics.  I'm really into it.  Hey, you know what?  I'm gonna say something now.  That might shock a few people.  I respect Matt from Queens because he's, uh, he's not hiding behind his instant feedback. 
[03:57:00]  He's the guy that said that Jill sucked and he's on our phones.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Thank you for taking my call.  Why did Jill suck?  And, uh, say that I'm a big fan of the show.  I, uh, really enjoy it.  But, I mean, after a while, I was like, who gives an F with what this girl thinks?  She's very pretty.  And I know she could do a lot of your shows by mentioning you guys on Channel 11.  But after a while, I was just putting on music.  That isn't why we had her on. 
[03:57:30]  She actually has a lot of personality, man.  She's really, like, I was watching her.  She has a great energy.  She can talk about anything.  She's a chick who's a hockey fan.  She's from Long Island, which, uh, we're from.  So, we got, like, some common, uh, uh, ground.  And we, we have a storyline going on with her that, uh, you know, uh, a lot of people behind  this, uh, Jill thing.  This Jill TV and all that.  I just, uh, appreciate you taking my call.  And, uh, you guys were on fire yesterday.  It was great.  And, uh, Jill-  Wow, a lot of people are saying yesterday sucked and today was really good. 
[03:58:00]  So, I don't know what to do anymore.  I thought today's-  Honestly, I thought today's show was one of the better shows we've done in a while.  So, uh, I didn't catch the beginning of the show because, uh, I was, I was in transit.  But, uh, usually I listen over the internet.  So, but, but, uh, I love it.  And, uh, thanks for taking my call.  And I'll see you guys, uh, whenever.  Hey, Matt, I respect you for not hiding behind, uh, like a fake screen name.  Thanks.  Thank you, man.  Okay.  All right.  It's Matt from, uh, Queens.  I got a phone call.  That's how your phone rings?  Yes, it's futuristic. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah.  Hello?  Bob.  Bob Eatman calling.  Oh, wow.  Hi, Bob.  When he calls your phone, you should go-  How you doing?  What the, what's that?  Am I off the air?  No.  How about getting an XM, fucko?  Yeah.  How about getting an XM, fuck tits?  Hey, cunt ears, how about getting an XM satellite radio and hooking it up and listening to it  while you're taking a shit?  How about that, Bobbo? 
[03:59:00]  Wow, Jimmy.  Jimmy, he's, he was listening to it.  Yeah, then what did he start doing?  Was he eating shit?  He just got out of the car.  Yeah, did he?  Why don't you buy a fucking portable unit, Bobbo?  Fuck you and fuck your car shit dick unit.  And he heard Jill Nicolini like that.  Yeah, did he?  Yes.  And what's he hear now?  Another call from fucking cock nose in the morning in fucking Utah? 
[03:59:30]  Tell fucko to get a portable unit and listen to all the-  Cock nose in the morning.  Cock nose in the morning.  Jimmy's, um, Jimmy says hi.  That's better than rape kid in crawl space.  Where's our rape kid in crawl space, sweetie?  I don't know.  Uh, Bob, I will call you back.  No, he won't.  When we get off the air.  Here's how you should answer the phone.  All right, how should I answer the phone?  What the fuck do you want? 
[04:00:00]  Can I help you, motherfucker?  I missed that one.  You know what, after, what did you just say again?  I can't remember, but it's going to make me laugh all day.  What?  Cock nose.  Yeah, cock nose.  I think we need new, uh, new sweepers, man. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, boy, this don't fare well.  What happened?  Uh, one, uh, let's see.  Stupid steam pipe traffic.  Yeah.  Have to meet, uh, there, I think.  Just from me.  From my girl.  Oh, and then, um, traffic is a mess across town.  Might be better.  Going north to the tri-borough, 57th Street, jammed to a crawl.  Oh. 
[04:01:00]  Son of a bitch.  Son of a gun.  They can't fucking figure this shit out with this city.  Why not just put some cones around the big hole and let everyone drive everywhere else?  Why, when something happens, do they have to block 18 blocks north and south and five blocks east and west of the hole?  The hole's 25 feet wide.  It's a big crater.  Put cones around it and don't let anyone go that way.  But every other road's open.  Can I play devil's advocate?  All right, devil. 
[04:01:30]  Advocate.  Because of the Jews.  All right.  I'll blame it on, let me, uh, text back, it's the Jews.  But don't be, don't be hateful.  Just say it's those pesky J's.  Okay.  Pesky J's.  And I'll put some exclamation points in happy faces to make it seem, uh, happy.  CBS FM.  CBS FM.  All right, celebs.  Yeah.  I want, where's Rape Kid?  He's not calling in?  No, Al Roker's blowing us off.  Let's be honest with each other.  Okay, so who cares?  I gotta go. 
[04:02:00]  I gotta meet Simon & Schuster with the CEO of Simon & Schuster.  What?  You're going to a shoe store?  No.  Wait a minute.  The CEO of Simon & Schuster wants to meet with me.  What?  He said there was something in it for me.  What?  And the ingredients in...  Oh, boy.  Hey, uh...  Leave.  Leave.  Are there any friends listening? 
[04:02:30]  Any friends of the show listening?  Wait, let me get this.  Don't mind me.  Ah, here we go.  I would like maybe if a friend could call my personal phone.  Because I have to get somewhere.  So if a friend could call...  Friend of the show.  I was thinking helicopter noise, actually.  Give me a call.  You're gonna need a helicopter.  And, um...  Tell Jill to get her fucking helicopter. 
[04:03:00]  The helicopter?  And then perhaps...  Because I gotta, uh...  Along with Jimmy, I gotta go.  Hope he's shit out of luck sitting here now.  What the fuck?  We gotta call Bob back.  Bob?  I'll call Bob back later.  I have to go.  I have to go there.  That's...  That's gonna be a hard one.  Alright.  Uh...  We got, uh...  Lines of the day?  Lines of the day.  Alright. 
[04:03:30]  What's a, uh...  Runner-up line of the day, E-Rock?  Let's say hi to Kevin in New Rochelle.  Kevin, what's up today?  What's up?  Hey, man.  Yo, Anthony.  Uh...  Your girlfriend might have been wise,  but she didn't have wisdom teeth yet.  Happy birthday, James.  That's not nice, sir.  What's this?  What is this thing?  What's that?  That we got from Channel 11.  Oh, that, uh...  Disky disc.  Oh, I don't know what the disky disc is.  What is it?  I like the little, uh, one gigabyte memory stick. 
[04:04:00]  Dude, a one gig memory stick.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  The Nicolini memory stick, I'm calling it.  Aw, I threw that away.  Dude!  What did I do?  It's great.  You transfer, uh...  Files.  I know what it is.  It's wonderful.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Okay.  I was just gonna ask a little bit,  about, uh, maybe a little bit  about your romantic life.  Oh, look at this.  A little bit about that.  Is there a gentleman?  Yes, there is.  I met someone three and a half months ago.  Three and a half months ago.  Mm-hmm.  He's, uh...  The news director at Channel 11. 
[04:04:30]  Oh, no.  Hello?  That was a good one.  What, did Al Roker find out, uh,  who we are or something?  Of course he did.  What a baby.  Yes.  What a fucking baby.  Oh, you could call him that.  What a baby.  That's right.  A baby.  Is Roland explaining why Al Roker's not on our show?  I was talking too long.  What happened then?  We've had no contact.  Of course not.  No contact. 
[04:05:00]  Of course not.  He was probably on a radio junket, press junket.  That's disrespectful.  Just accept everything, and then what's next?  Fuck that.  That was disrespectful.  Well, I'd like to know from Roland why he, uh...  Where's Roland?  Roland!  Besides not exercising, where's he?  Here's a, uh...  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Meaning there was another green.  Oh, so you were well within the green.  Oh, yeah.  We weren't playing the, uh, uh, you know,  the light is changing as we're going through the internet.  I drive so cautious, because I have such precious cargo. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, shut up!  Precious cargo!  Precious cargo!  Kenny gets one.  Wow!  Yeah, that was funny.  Roland, where's Al Roker?  Using my old nickname that my...  That broad used to call me.  Precious.  Also known as my mom's mom.  Precious.  Yeah, going back.  Precious.  Uh, what's up, Roland?  No, I called and left messages and emailed his people twice and responded.  Okay, Roland did nothing wrong.  So he's an ass.  Yes.  What? 
[04:06:00]  He's an ass.  Why is he an ass?  Wow.  Easy, Roland.  Easy.  Oh, those are fighting words.  With Roland, that is fighting words.  All right.  Okay, so tomorrow we'll, uh, we'll talk about Al.  Uh, tomorrow's Al Roker Day.  Al Roker Friday.  Al Roker Friday.  That's right.  Uh, here's another runner-up line of the day.  All right.  How to spell Nicolini.  Wait, is everyone still throwing the butt things around?  Look at that.  Butt at him.  Yeah.  Throw a half an ass at the complete ass.  I didn't like that because it was at your expense, Eric. 
[04:06:30]  Of course you didn't.  Hey, uh.  I'll go for that.  Um.  I would hold that in for hours.  Is there a fart in front of Jill?  You didn't want to blast a fart in front of Jill.  If she did it, it would have been fine.  We got hold music?  Yes.  Oh, yes, yes.  Can you give me the, um, not that one, the other one?  The, uh, chicken cutlet.  Ah, the cutlet.  Oh, is this what you were going to do?  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  Okay, good.  I want to know.  Ah, there's a cutlet, um, where the hell is it?  Right there, Jimmy.  Where's the fake ass?  Yeah, there it is.  Sweetie, there you are.  All right.  Um.  Big ass half.  And, and pal talk's off?  Um, hold on.  This has got to be way inside.  I'm just, I want to see some.  Yep, it's off.  All right, hold music.  Hit.  Oh, you want it?  Yeah.  Yeah.

I, I, I showed incredible restraint today.  Because that would have caused a problem.  That would have caused major, major problems, yeah.  Oh, that would have caused a problem.  Yeah, well, there you go.  I'm glad you guys laughed at that.  That makes me feel good.  Thank you.  And that was your line of the day right there, right?

All right.  Here's your line of the day, Jimmy.  Oh, no, no, no.  You guys should take your time.  I need a friend.  To help me.  I gotta go.  The CEO is actually holding off a meeting waiting for me.  Oh.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Well, make him wait.  You're a best-selling author, Jimmy Norton.  Well, I'm number four.  If I was number one, I'd say, sit down, Jack. 
[04:08:30]  But I'm not.  I'm number one.  And what do you call, uh, Creepy Bob now?  Bobo?  Bobo?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Why don't you get your own portable unit, shit dick toes?  Fucking, that's what Bob's toes are.  Ten queer dicks with shit on them.  What the fuck?  And his fucking heel is a shit-covered helmet.  Old cock feet.  Likes to just clip his toenails with his own mouth.  Don't you, Bobo? 
[04:09:00]  I guess you don't need Bob anymore.  I certainly do.  I say that with affection and love.  I definitely need Bob.  My managers don't know about radio.  Well, you can't just syndicate to England?  No.  All right.  Good, John.  Good point.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  Thank you, guys.  Always make it such a great birthday.  Thank you.  Here's your line of the day.  Here's your line of the day.  Line of the day.  We get it.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.

Yes.  Yes.  Wait.  I have to object.  Why?  Why?  I have to say.  Huh?  Was it me?  No.  Oh.  You had.  No, the line I thought you were the last day for you had.  It was actually mentioned in the runner-up line. 
[04:10:00]  Your line was mentioned.  It was a great line.  I forget what it was.  Oh, thanks, Jimmy.  Coming from here, that means a lot.  Thanks so much.  Thanks so much.  No, Anthony, I thought on that one, should have gotten that one because he said something  about something mintier.  That was me.  Did you the one that said mintier?  Oh, boy.  No, no.  Who said mintier?  Whoever.  That was the line.  Oh, my God.  Now, now you don't even know our voices anymore.  That was hopey.  Why?  I was laughing.  I wasn't worried about who said it.  You don't even know who's who anymore.  What's wrong?  Getting old?  I'm an older gentleman.  I'm 57 years young.  58 in March. 
[04:10:30]  March.  So, yeah, to me, that was the line.  I thought I had more of the assist on that one, but thank you for the message.  Hey, there's a lot of controversy with the very inside joke that I did just for the  boys.  Fuck them.  It had nothing to do with Jill Nickman.  No, no, not at all.  I swear to God.  I swear to you.  Eh, relax.  Figure it out.  Or don't.  Eh, let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie, real shit, it's extra small.  The one you can count on the book of guests for a session, but ends every single sentence  he says in a question. 
[04:11:00]  No pronunciation, soft spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he clumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, bonadeus, check him out Friday wide.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  Ah.  It was good.  I mean, it had action, suspense.  Hey, this is Jill Nicolini.  You're listening to my pal, Lil' Jim and Norton.  You're so cute.  You're so cute. </pre>
