<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about the excessive snow and garbage in New York City, speculating on a potential federal investigation into the city's snow removal efforts. This transitioned into a discussion about President Obama wearing shorts on vacation, comparing his attire to that of previous presidents.  The hosts then launched into a comedic, graphically detailed discussion about the "penis gourd" people from a documentary about the Combine Tribe, filled with humorous speculation about their culture and potential technological adoption.

The conversation shifted to the viral YouTube video of Ted Williams, a homeless man with a remarkably good radio voice.  They speculated on his potential radio career, but also predicted a likely downward spiral due to the pressures of newfound fame and his history of drug and alcohol abuse.  A lengthy discussion with regular caller Troy about conspiracy theories followed, specifically focusing on mass bird deaths.  Troy initially presented various theories, but eventually grew more skeptical, preferring mainstream explanations. The discussion explored the nature of conspiracy theories, using 9/11 as a case study to contrast evidence with speculation, and debated the credibility of different information sources.

The next segment opened with a shouting match between Opie and Danny about their communication styles.  This was followed by the playing of music as an apparently disgruntled employee, Troy, left the studio, with the hosts speculating about his mental state, calling him a "psychopath." The show then welcomed Louis C.K. as a guest.  They discussed his career, including his sold-out Carnegie Hall show and FX series, his upcoming Atlantic City tour, and his experiences with online criticism and backlash, particularly concerning his tweets about Sarah Palin. He shared a story about an email from a father whose daughter has Down syndrome, which profoundly impacted him.  The hosts also reminisced about a never-completed song recorded with a homeless man named Gray Wolf, praised Jim Brewer's YouTube videos, reviewed the movie "Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps," and reminisced about the J.C. Whitney catalog.

Ron Perlman then joined the show.  They discussed his career, including "Season of the Witch" and his experiences with Marlon Brando on "The Island of Dr. Moreau." Perlman shared his political views ("lifelong, lower middle class Jew lefty from upper Manhattan"), his viewing habits, and anecdotes about his role in *Sons of Anarchy*, including interactions with fans and a humorous motorcycle safety course anecdote.  A discussion ensued about Katie Segal's breasts.  The conversation returned to Louis C.K., who detailed his creative control over his show, his unconventional production methods (including casually replacing actors, his daughters, without informing FX), and anecdotes about shooting the show, such as a man flipping off the camera and a visible clothing tag.  The discussion touched upon his creative process, work ethic, and interactions with FX executives.

A later segment focused on the high cost of licensing the theme song "Louie Louie" ($20,000 per episode), leading to the host tracking down Ian Lloyd to record a new version.  They discussed the near-identical recreation of the song, with one lyric changed from "you're going to cry" to "you're going to die."  The conversation shifted back to Louis C.K., discussing audience reactions to his show, his views on comedy and drama, and a poker scene with initially more explicit language that was toned down by FX.  He recounted a phone call from a gay website surprised by the scene's perspective coming from a straight man, and discussed homophobic remarks and unauthorized tweets from his account. This led to a debate about the removal of the word "nigger" from *Huckleberry Finn*, with Louis C.K. arguing against the change.  Multiple callers joined the discussion, debating censorship, historical context, and the handling of racially charged language.

The final segment began with a discussion about public versus private schools, touching on education quality, wealth, "PC" messaging, and resource disparities.  A caller, Melissa, thanked Louis C.K. for helping her leave a bad marriage, leading to a crude and vulgar discussion about her marital problems.  The conversation then returned to Louis C.K.'s career and his upcoming Comedy Central special "Hilarious."  Louis C.K. and Ron Perlman remained as guests throughout much of this portion of the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, let's do this.  Oh my god, we're still digging out from the snow?  Uh, they're just showing up every ding-dong day.  What the hell? I thought the snow was gone.  Every ding-dong day they show this.  And now the garbage is piled. Have you seen the garbage piles now that it's another day?  Yeah, yeah.  We talked about this yesterday.  I'm walking in tunnels at this point on the sidewalk.  They can't get rid of it fast enough.  In front of your building, dude, on the side between our buildings, it literally is a five-foot or six-foot-high pile of garbage. 
[00:00:30]  You saw that, right?  Yeah.  Unbelievable. And now we've got another snowstorm coming to New York City later this week.  Lots of garbage.  Maybe tomorrow, actually, Jimmy. You better get the fuck out of here now.  I don't want to leave now.  No, I think it's late tomorrow or something, but the feds are looking into the snow job.  The snow job here in New York City.  Yeah, that'll be another glossing over because all the supervisors have said they didn't do anything, they didn't tell their guys anything, and the guys were working hard. 
[00:01:00]  I just want to point out that I think the feds listen to us because this is what we were saying yesterday, and a day later, it's right there on the front page of the newspaper.  Oh, yeah. The feds. We're the number one show with the feds.  We're way more than just shock talks.  The feds.  We're on top of things happening in the world.  On top of things.  We certainly are, Anthony. We certainly are.  Cutting edge.  We're right there.  Well, it's either the snow job or Obama wearing shorts on vacation. People are outraged, so I don't know what to do today. 
[00:01:30]  Have they run out of things to really bash Obama about?  You're supposed to wear.  You could argue with politics all you want. That's fine, but when it gets down to now, we don't think you should be wearing shorts on vacation.  Enough already.  Enough already.  I don't agree with his policies, but I could give a shit if he's wearing one of those sticks on his dick like they do on those African tribes, South American tribes, whatever they are.  The stick, the big carrot dick thing that they wear.  One of my all-time favorite breaks we ever did. I don't even know if it was funny for the people. 
[00:02:00]  Carrot dick fucking outfit.  When we discovered the stick dick people.  What is it?  Penis gourd.  The penis gourd people? Can I get a picture of a penis gourd person?  They put on a penis gourd while they fucking blow dart a monkey.  No, is this the one, though, where the sticks are literally three feet out?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  They actually tie them up to their shoulders sometimes.  One of my favorite things ever.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  He's wearing a penis gourd. I hope he gives him a break.  And you want a cell phone? 
[00:02:30]  You're not getting one anytime soon until you get rid of that three-foot stick on your dick.  What is he doing?  It's a penis gourd.  It's like accessorizing.  He's wearing a watch.  Looks like Venus Flytrap.  He's going to see Mr. Carlson.  Maybe penis gourd.  I think Brett Favre should become a stick dick person.  Oh, where is penis gourd?  Penis gourd and then send that picture out.  That would be way more impressive, Brett.  Look at these assholes.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  If you gave that tribe cell phones, how long before they were texting their penis gourds to women? 
[00:03:00]  What do you look up online?  Penis gourd people?  Yeah, you could search for either penis gourd or check out the Combine Tribe.  K-O-M-B-A-I.  They could be my favorite people on the planet.  Oh, they kick ass.  They kick ass.  There was a documentary on them way, way back.  There's a whole show about the Combine Tribe.  Yeah, yeah.  It was pretty good.  That was fantastic.  What?  There's a new show?  It was about a year and a half, two years ago.  Oh, fuck.  It's called Living with the Combine Tribe with these two, like, English dudes.  It's actually a really interesting one to watch if you've seen it from front to back. 
[00:03:30]  Shouldn't it be called Living with the Stick Dick People?  Stick dicks.  Stick dicks.  They look like fools.  They certainly do.  I wish I spoke their language.  I'd like to click out.  It'd be like, hey.  Click out, you're an asshole.  You look stupid.  With their penis gourd.  Can you look any dumber than that?  Look at that chick.  All these girls have to be fucking, like, still in their teens, and their tits are sagging  down to their bellies.  It's funny watching that show, too, because, like, you know, you see all these different  chicks, and, you know, they're all disgusting, but you have to grade on a curve, you know? 
[00:04:00]  And so you end up seeing one that's like, all right, and you're going, yeah, all right,  yeah.  I like her.  She's my favorite.  And then you step away from the TV, and you go, wait a second.  She's a three in the real world.  I'm staring at her already.  She's pretty hot for combine drive.  I'm just saying.  Just saying.  Yeah, they show tit and everything.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you would jerk to that, though, if you were younger.  Younger, maybe, yeah.  13, 14.  Yeah, because a tit was a tit.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Back then.  Oh, yeah, it was.  If you saw a nipple, it didn't matter. 
[00:04:30]  Now you're very picky.  You just kind of, you troll around.  You troll around many sites, many different pictures, finding the perfect one.  That's right.  So why did we say stick dick?  Oh, because of Obama.  Obama, yeah, he's catching some shit for his attire on vacation.  But he has really nice black shorts on, you know, some of those shorts that'll cost you a few bucks.  Yeah.  And then he's got a collared white shirt on, and then he's got, like, kind of flip-flops on.  Mm-hmm.  And then they show the leaders, wow, what's wrong with that woman's tit? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  That fucking place.  Looks like her baby's a lefty.  Wow.  Yeah, really.  The one tit's just hanging down twice as far as the other tit.  Saying, what about me?  The other tit's really sagging.  Fuck are me.  And you know the one over there is, like, 12.  Yeah, that'll get you in trouble.  The one up front with the tits that are firm.  They're not pretty girls.  No, they're not.  That's why.  She actually looks like Obama on the end.  Yeah, wow, look at that.  Her face looks like Obama. 
[00:05:30]  Holy shit, really does.  Yeah.  So, I'm just got firm little titties.  So, the big story is Obama wearing, not wearing.  Oh, my God.  What are those?  What are they doing?  That can't just be from no bra.  It looks like someone took boogers and stuck them on someone's chest.  You know who the one on the left looks like?  You remember English from Escape from Alcatraz?  I figured there's two reasons you didn't sit on my step. 
[00:06:00]  She's not a lovely girl at all.  What, do they use their tits for chewing gum?  It really is disgusting.  She's Paul Benjamin.  She's fucking terrible.  That's horrendous.  Anyway.  So, then they show all the presidents and what they wore on vacation.  Because there's a problem with what Obama's wearing, I guess.  Yeah.  And the picture right next to Obama is President Bush, George W. from 2007, wearing pretty much  the exact same thing on vacation, except Bush has black socks on and Crocs. 
[00:06:30]  Crocs.  What do they want these guys to wear when they relax?  I don't get it.  And then the next president would be good old Clinton from 96 with his giant over-the-top  red bathing suit and a horrendous t-shirt and sneakers with no socks on as he's walking  the beach and his sunglasses around his neck, you know, with that neck thing, that neck holder 
[00:07:00]  thing.  He looks horrendous.  Yeah.  And then, of course, they show you Ronnie.  Ronnie Reagan, 82.  Walking the beach and he's got dress shoes on and slacks.  He's got cowboy boots on.  Oh, cowboy boots.  Sorry, yes.  Slacks.  His loud striped shirt.  Yeah, and that's him walking on the beach.  He felt like that's the best he could do if he's on a beach.  And then you got Nixon, who's even worse.  Nixon looks like he's wearing a suit.  Right.  And then, of course, Kennedy is wearing slacks, too, man. 
[00:07:30]  Kennedy wearing boating attire, though.  Kennedy wore a lot of boating attire.  Yeah, but long pants?  Well, they're kind of like, they're not really pants.  They're like dockers.  Loafers.  He's got, like, dockers and stuff.  He's ready to hit the sailboat and do some of that sailing.  You know how hot that is, though?  Yes.  You know how sweaty those loafers get?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What page are you guys on?  You need to know what it is?  Yeah, post page 18.  Oh, page 18.  That's your work. 
[00:08:00]  Turn your workbook.  So you think Clinton was the first one to wear shorts on vacation?  Yeah, he was the first one that said, I don't give a shit.  It looks like.  Yeah, absolutely.  It doesn't look like that.  So Obama's not doing anything fucking crazy here.  Well, you know what it is?  It's the flip-flops, I think, because even Bubba's wearing the sneakers.  Right.  It's the flip-flops.  I don't know.  I think flip-flops way better than Crocs.  I give a shit more that he's on fucking vacation all the time than what he's wearing during 
[00:08:30]  vacation, so.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Well, Reagan had a horrible shirt on there.  Yes.  That's a just child.  Looks like something E-Rock would wear.  Yeah.  It's one of those E-Rock kids shirts.  All right.  My little stripes.  Oh, yeah.  The stick people.  All right.  Yeah, I don't.  I'm distracted by the stick dick people.  Shit about fucking.  I just want more and more pictures of these fucking weirdos with their three-foot gourds  as they're trying to hunt in the forest. 
[00:09:00]  You think that gets in the way?  So inconvenient.  You think?  Put a three-foot-long stick on your dick and try to do anything.  These people are hunting.  Try to do anything.  Try to play a video game with a three-foot stick on your dick and you're going to have  a problem.  What happens in Connect Dancing when you have that?  Yes, yes.  Connect Dancing.  Is there a game called Connect Dancing?  Can the Connect recognize the penis gourd?  Oh, boy.  I know.  Oh, boy.  That'll be an interesting little video after everything's done. 
[00:09:30]  The highlight video.  Oh.  With your three-foot dick stick waving around.  I can't see anything.  It's just right in the lens of the Connect.  Blocking it out.  You know what?  Yes, there is dancing, by the way.  I do have it.  I haven't done it.  Why would you?  But people have.  Isn't that a game for girls?  To watch them move their ass?  Yeah, yeah.  And it seems to be very hard to do.  Like, very...  A lot of...  You work out a lot. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, I would imagine.  I'm sure it's hard to do, but...  I like when these fucking Westerners come over and show these tribes how to smoke and shit.  And they're putting a bone through this guy's nose.  Is he going to put a stick on his dick?  It's right by his face.  This English guy's sitting down, and there's a stick dick right by...  The guy's balls are right by his face.  Right.  Now it's at the back of his head.  Ah, they're going to fucking pierce his...  They're poking a bone through his nose.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:10:30]  And look at his fingers.  That's got to be sterile.  No, it's probably not clean.  Oh, literal Jim.  He is a...  You think that's fecal matter in his nails?  Oh, there's so much fecal matter.  It's fucking deer blood.  It's everything.  Ah, right through.  He just put a bone through the white guy's nose.  They're laughing at him.  Ah-ha, you dumb white...  Why is he doing that, the white guy?  Just because he needs attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are the fat laces in the Adidas of the...  Right, right.  Oof.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:11:00]  And now they're breaking the ends off so it stays in there, I guess.  I don't know.  What the hell?  My eyes are watering, guys.  My eyes are definitely watering.  Do they understand it?  Now they just eat him.  Oh, check that out.  I haven't cried since I was six.  They're laughing and yucking it up right before they cave his head in with a rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Look.  There's a little...  They make hats out of his white skin.  If you're kidding. 
[00:11:30]  That's great.  Now they're wiping their glimmy fingers in his eyes.  Oh.  He's gonna get conjunctivitis.  What are they saying?  Oh.  That guy's got mean.  They probably have a few words.  They hang a pig's tooth necklace around my neck and tie a cord around my head.  The simple adornments of a combi man.  Why didn't Iraq just put it under his pillow?  But then something much worse.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  What's he doing?  For reasons I'm not entirely clear about, combi men invert their penis, somehow pushing 
[00:12:00]  it back into their body, unwrapping what's left in a leaf.  And with a polite reserve of an Englishman abroad, I don't quite know how to refuse without  causing offense.  This guy's fucking with this English guy's dick.  They're all laughing at us.  They're pushing it back in.  This probably doesn't have to have much farther to be pushed back in.  No, I'm feeling faint.  Anyway.  What do you mean they're pushing back?  Into your body? 
[00:12:30]  And invert it.  And stick it back in, which is culturally sensitive as I want to be.  Probably.  Invent a car.  And then what are they wrapping?  It's balls.  They wrap the dick up so it doesn't pop back out.  This is a dick.  Nah.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is on YouTube.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Guy's like, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  They want to live with the natives.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is this like the English Steve-O? 
[00:13:00]  He's doing some crazy shit.  Fuck.  Wait, he's off me.  That's very strange.  That's very strange.  It's like having his penis inverted.  Making him walk funny.  He just fell down.  Falling down.  Fuck.  Well, that's what you get for not being offensive, stupid.  Oh, I just went really faint then, like I was about to fall over.  I still can't quite hear my own voice.  They rolled my foreskin and then did a sudden movement with a hand and the thing went back 
[00:13:30]  in and, um, it was really very unpleasant and I nearly fell over.  I thought that it's not working.  Come on.  Hard to believe that having your cock pushed back in is unpleasant.  What is wrong with this guy?  He looks silly.  He's got a tattoo on his fucking left-ass cheek.  I bet you they do that in some kind of a weird, A, to protect the dick, or B, so it's  not hurt in combat or running.  There has to be a reason. 
[00:14:00]  Probably, because they're running through all kinds of shit.  Or maybe they're just bored and they just make up shit to do with each other.  What should we do with our dick?  Right.  Wow, that's crazy.  Look that shit up online today.  I, uh...  You'll enjoy it.  The stick people.  They push his penis back in, but...  Huh?  And then they put the gourd on to make it look like you still have a penis.  Hey, gordo.  What is that for?  What is that thing?  I got fit.  That one's hard to hear.  Oh.  That's good. 
[00:14:30]  Why would you put the...  I don't know.  Yeah, they should transcribe it.  They're a silly, silly-ass tribe.  Yeah, they're not ready for apps yet.  No.  These people are not ready for apps.  The guy looks silly.  He's got a gourd sticking out of his pants zipper.  Right.  You know, these other guys walk around all naked and just fucking...  Oh, boy.  The black guy just said, I love you.  He looks like you when I was 15.  You're not from here, he says.  Oh, boy.  You wear trousers.  Oh, boy.  Take your trousers off.  He looks like...  What's his name?  What is that? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, boy.  He's making him take his trousers off.  Oh, you must take them off.  Otherwise, you can't wear the cotica properly.  Also known as the gourd.  The cotica is the dead stick.  And now he's naked walking through the woods.  Now he's just walking through the jungle naked with a stick on his dick.  And he's from England.  Walking to his own gangbang.  Oh.  He doesn't even know it yet.  What a bunch of dolts.  They really are.  Some ceremony so they can eat a pig later.  He's got to take it up the ass.  God. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  What fools?  Well, fucking Europeans were inventing ships and things that fly.  All right.  These guys were still putting sticks on their penises.  Twisting foreskin.  Silly geese.  Silly.  Speaking of penises, we got this.  Peanuts are now on Northwest Airlines' snack menu.  And travelers with allergies are flooding the carrier with complaints about the change.  Northwest began serving peanuts this month as its merger partner, Atlanta-based Delta Airlines, has done for years. 
[00:16:00]  Georgia is the top peanut-producing state in the country.  Delta says that it will make seating and service accommodations for peanut-allergic passengers.  All right.  She loves the penis.  So if you're allergic to the penis, what?  They put you in first class?  Is that what it is?  Whoa, that's nice.  There's a special penis section.  Yeah, special penis section.  You don't like the penis?  Some people have penis allergies.  Fucking colts are going down, motherfucker.  Sorry.  Locally, they're talking about our Jets, Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  Our Jets.  Yes, yes.  The Jets.  The terrific Jets.  Good old Mark Sanchez.  Well, we'll see, won't we?  I'm going to bet a fuckload against the Jets.  You're a Jets fan.  Yeah, but I'm, you know, I'm going to make a couple of bucks.  What's the over, man?  Maybe you go a little over.  I don't even know who to bet with.  What am I kidding?  I don't know a bookie.  You don't know a bookie.  I wish I did.  I might know a bookie.  Like, I need to gamble more.  They should do.  I'm talking about.  This is a one-time gamble, though. 
[00:17:00]  This is easy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I can do that.  We're on a little action on the game.  I bet you Roddy B knows a bookie.  It probably does.  Atlantic City's talking about it because the casinos are fucking hurting so bad.  They are, right?  Yeah, they're talking about opening up a couple more casinos, opening up sports betting.  They don't have sports betting in AC?  No.  Not really.  No.  And online.  They want to talk about doing some online fucking action.  Maybe it's good that a lot of people aren't gambling.  Why is that? 
[00:17:30]  Because they're fucking gambling away everything they have.  You have the money.  Nah, just what they do is you've got to be responsible.  People aren't responsible with their gambling.  But you put anything out there that's pleasurable and exciting to people, and some people are going  to overdo it.  Other people can deal with it.  They're opening up these.  Of course, I'm one that overdoes it.  I don't mind the big places that they have all over the place.  But now they're opening up these mini casinos, and it seems like almost every other neighborhood.  Really?  People are going there with their paychecks. 
[00:18:00]  The engines?  And eventually that's going to hurt us.  We're going to get hit over the fucking head by somebody.  Is it the engine people?  Yeah, because in Sim City, if you open up a casino, your crime goes up.  Absolutely.  And you've got to get more cops in there, or else your crime goes up.  I don't know.  Like I said, you've got the big ones.  You've got your AC.  You've got your fucking Vegas.  Yeah.  You've got a few of those boat places.  Foxwoods.  But when it's in the middle of a horrible neighborhood, that's dangerous shit. 
[00:18:30]  Do we have to go that far with this?  Stay in the compound.  I was in Vegas for a week, and I probably lost maybe $300, maybe less on video poker here  and there.  I would drop in $20.  You love the video poker.  I do, but I wanted to keep playing.  But it's like, eh, just win $30 and quit, lose $40, quit.  But Vegas is one of those places.  It's a destination you've got to plan for, unless you're local, obviously.  Did you see the real Vegas?  You go two blocks off the strip, and you see what that town is really about?  It's actually nice.  I mean, I've done it many times, and I used to work with Dice.  It's actually nice. 
[00:19:00]  Maybe a couple of hundred yards down the road.  No, you've got to go...  You're a Jew-mutter-fucker.  You've got to go a little further in than that, Jimmy.  You'll see some sad people and some sad fucking situations.  The horrible fucking motels that people book for a week.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen some of those.  They're terrible.  Oh, yeah.  The cash places.  I have a gig in Henderson, which is 10 miles from the strip in February.  Wow.  Now, what's that going to be like? 
[00:19:30]  Probably me and five fans.  Yeah.  Where's Henderson?  It's, I don't know.  I think it's Henderson.  I know it's a few miles from the strip.  Yeah, but it's the local gate.  It's the local casino.  Huh.  Very cool.  All right.  Hey, everyone's talking about homeless Ted Williams, so let's get this out of the way.  This fucking video, man.  I've never had more people tweet me the same fucking thing than this Ted Williams video  from yesterday.  Yeah, you could officially stop.  Yeah, you could please stop.  And I appreciate people trying to turn me on to shit all the time. 
[00:20:00]  Thank you.  But playing it on the radio is just not going to do it justice, unfortunately.  So search out the video.  The video, I think, is up to well over two million views in one fucking day.  One fucking day.  Do you know about this, Jimmy, the Ted Williams guy?  I guess out of Columbus, Ohio, there's a homeless guy, homeless Ted Williams.  And someone noticed him.  And he's got a golden radio voice.  You want to play it off YouTube so we get the visual for Jimmy?  Just watch this. 
[00:20:30]  There are often homeless people asking for change and freeway exit ramps.  But recently, there's been this guy with an interesting sign at I-71 and Hudson Street.  His handwritten sign says he has the God-given gift of a great voice.  Hey, I'm going to make you work for your dollar.  Say something with that great radio voice.  When you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies, you're listening to Magic 98.9.  Thank you so much.  God bless you.  Thank you.  And we'll be back with more right after these words.  And don't forget, tomorrow morning is your chance to win a pair of tickets to see this man live in concert. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you so much.  Well, when I was 14 years old, I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.  When I was 14, I kind of listened to one of our area radio announcers.  And I went as a field trip to go meet the guy.  And he looked nothing like what he sounded like.  So I asked him about that.  And he said to me, listen, radio is defined theater of mind. 
[00:21:30]  And so when he said theater of mind, I just said, hey, I can't be an actor.  I can't be an on-air personality.  But the voice just became something of a development over years.  And I went to school for it.  And then alcohol and drugs and a few other things became a part of my life.  Sounds like my story.  And I'm trying hard to get it back.  And hopefully somebody from one of these televisions or radios say, hey, I need a voiceover or I need something.  So, you know, I'm hoping one day watch Family Guy, weeknights at 730 on Fox 28, anything. 
[00:22:00]  But that's what it is.  And I love radio.  That guy is so getting a job.  Oh, wow.  Now it's pushing almost 3 million views.  This thing was posted yesterday.  Yeah.  This thing is everywhere.  I've never seen a video explode so fast in my life.  Yeah, it's very strange.  I mean, I saw it after the show yesterday.  I saw it literally with just about 300 views on it.  Yeah.  And now it's up to 2.8 million.  Yeah.  So that's how YouTube works. 
[00:22:30]  It stays at 300 until the counter catches up.  How quickly will this guy have a gig?  Well, they're saying he might have one today because he's supposed to be on local radio.  And the whole gag is they're going to offer him a job.  So we'll see what happens.  Yeah, but CNN's on top of it now.  That's good.  Everybody is on top of this.  You guys have a good voice, right?  Good.  It's amazing.  He could be hired tomorrow.  It's such a fucking voiceover guy.  It is that voice that you feel comfortable with, right?  Yeah.  And the guy is a mess.  He's a homeless guy. 
[00:23:00]  Obviously, the drugs and alcohol did its job on him.  He looks like shit.  Let me hear his voice again.  He really does have an amazing old golden age radio voice.  Hey, I'm going to make you work for your dollar.  Say something with that great radio voice.  When you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies, you're listening to Magic 98.9.  Thank you so much.  God bless you.  Thank you.  And we'll be back with more right after these words.  Wouldn't it be ironic to hear him intro Mustard doing a song?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  I said we would hire him in a second, but I think we're way late to the party. 
[00:23:30]  Have him fucking voice our stuff here.  But everyone's on top of this guy.  Yeah, this guy.  Everybody.  How many likes?  He's a big star.  31,000.  31.  Almost 32,000 likes.  Well, I don't like.  Give me a mark of demerit.  Thumb down.  Well, you know what?  You must be one of those 82 people that didn't like this video.  Thumb down.  They're all radio people out of work?  Probably.  They're just assholes.  People just have to be assholes because they can't help themselves.  How do you dislike a video like that? 
[00:24:00]  Seriously.  What's wrong with you?  I don't like his hair.  You know what?  Or his teeth that look like they're about to fall out of his fucking head.  He is a bum.  Fall out of his head.  That's a voice that he's actually standing outside on the highway with.  Right.  There's no modulation.  No professional processing or anything.  Yeah, because they threw that.  Just threw a flip phone or an iPhone or whatever the fuck this guy used to videotape.  Right.  Record this.  Yeah, you get him in a production studio and you throw him through a couple filters. 
[00:24:30]  That voice becomes ridiculous.  If he's talking to you in person, you could probably feel the bass in your chest.  Right.  And smell the breath in your nose.  Wow.  But he's clean for two years trying to get his shit together.  Is he, though?  Yeah.  You don't think he's clean?  I hope so.  I hope Mustard's still doing good.  Yeah, I'm hoping to.  I, I, I, he kind of looks like he's, what?  What?  He should, if he's clean, and been clean for, what did he say, two years?  Yeah.  Why doesn't he get his shit together and fucking start putting in some goddamn recordings? 
[00:25:00]  Well, that's why he has this sign.  Oh, is that it?  A sign on the side of the road.  A sign on the side of the road.  A sign on the side of the road.  A sign on the side of the road.  Although it did for him.  Do you think he can get a real voiceover agent?  In a second.  Oh, Eatman probably handles him already.  And this, in a second, this guy will be hired by the end of the week to do something.  But I hope he doesn't just get a shit radio job.  No kidding.  There's real money in voiceover.  Right.  Like a lot of money in real voiceover, which, he could probably do that.  Hi, uh, yeah, it's Anthony.  Can I speak to, uh, Bob Eatman?  Oh, he's on the phone with a bum. 
[00:25:30]  But it's just another client.  Bob's a fool.  So.  Yeah, yeah, man.  Everyone's talking about it.  What's the name of the video?  Like, uh, greatest homeless man with golden radio voice in Columbus, Ohio.  Unbelievable.  Oh, and he's in Ohio?  Okay.  Columbus, Ohio.  So, yeah, now everybody has reposted the video.  So, it's, you know, it's a hundred thousand copies of it.  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.  So, uh, thanks to everybody that sent me that yesterday.  But you don't have to send it anymore, please. 
[00:26:00]  Sunski.  So, that's, uh, that's a big story today.  Yeah, it's nice to see.  How is a guy like that out of work?  I don't know.  Maybe he's still drinking.  Who knows?  And radio's like...  Yeah, but most of the radio guys drink.  That's true.  Radio's a weird thing, man.  I've seen nothing but alcoholics in this fucking business.  Radio's cut back everything in this room.  You're the only non-alky in here.  Sorry, Dan.  And, but let's be honest with our three selves.  Well, good news is that if you're on YouTube and you just search homeless radio, which hopefully 
[00:26:30]  a lot of people are going to be doing today.  Yeah.  Uh, they'll find out this radio show, homeless radio with Tippi Tom.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, hey, that's good.  Now, that's a homeless radio guy.  Fuck yeah, man.  But, you know.  Tippi Tom.  Taken from us.  Much too young.  That fucking guy.  Much too young.  How old was he?  Who knows?  Who knows?  News.  I don't think he was that old.  I don't think he was either.  He was either 35 or 60.  We don't know.  But he knew, uh, Barry Manilow had a dog named Bagel.  Yeah! 
[00:27:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  He is missed, that fucking smelly motherfucker.  Really missed.  Oh, crap.  Hey, we got more birds dying, I hear.  Really?  Yeah, and where was it?  Louisiana now?  Down south?  Got more birds dying.  I've been reading a lot about this, and I've been reading a lot of comments.  Uh, after the stories, and, uh, boy, a lot of people bringing up that harp thing in  Alaska.  They got that harp array. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That, uh, Jesse the Body, uh, was talking about on his first season of Conspiracy Theory,  his show.  And, uh, so everybody's saying that's what it is.  It's not.  It's harp.  Maybe they're doing some harp shit, but birds aren't dying because of that.  The ones in Louisiana, they're saying, all right, enough already.  They flew into power lines.  Stop.  Yeah.  This happens, and that's what happened down here.  They lost 500 birds in Louisiana.  And the ones in Arkansas, uh, the more research you do on this, they say you look up, there's 
[00:28:00]  so many goddamn birds in the sky that the sky looks black.  Like craziness, birds.  Like birds where, yeah, you don't even see the sky.  We've never seen that many birds around here.  Yeah.  So if fireworks or some lightning happens, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna fucking  scare some birds.  Maybe they crashed into each other.  They don't have room to maneuver.  That's what it is.  Maybe, uh.  They got startled and fucking did headers into each other.  Yeah.  You know how birds are. 
[00:28:30]  Angry birds.  Maybe they flew into some wooden or ice, uh, blocks.  Maybe they're just doing a little deconstruction.  And there's a little, a couple of piggies in there.  With hard hats.  With hard hats on.  We're pigs with hard hats bound at the scene.  Running away.  The pigs that sound like Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  You want to get Troy in here?  Because Troy has questions.  Does he have any, has he, has he commented, um, on, uh, on this? 
[00:29:00]  Has he done research on this now?  Well, I don't know.  We told him.  Well, this is, this story is a week old about almost, uh, what, what, what, what?  He should have done a little research, right?  Well, I think Troy gets mad at us because he has questions and we don't take him seriously.  Sauntering in.  And all we say is do your research.  Ah, yes.  Hi, Troy.  How are you, sir?  Hi, Troy.  What's going on?  You dropped your water today.  Troy put his water down right by his headphones and he just knocked it over and it made me laugh. 
[00:29:30]  Something, something happened here.  Kalos.  Kalos.  Kalos.  Get him a drink.  Something happened here.  Where's your wife?  You think I bring her around?  I'm going to let your conspiracy nuts get involved with her.  I saw that last night.  I just am laughing.  My balls off a raging bull.  Let your bums get involved with her.  In a cage.  I have to rage.  It's the fucking greatest.  Orrid.  Troy looks defeated already.  You can't be defeated.  You got to hang in there because you have questions.  No, no.  You're representing a part of this audience that listens to this show. 
[00:30:00]  There's other people out there that have questions.  Dude, I'm jumping off, man.  I'm just, whatever the mainstream media is telling me, that's what I'm going to believe from here on out.  Attaboy.  What are you doing to yourself?  Now he sounds sarcastic.  You got questions and there's another 500 blackbirds dead in Louisiana.  Dude, it's so much easier to sleep at night if you just believe what you're told.  You know?  Ah, ignorance is bliss.  You're not saying you should believe what you're told, but all we're saying to you, if you have all these questions, you got to do a little more research.  Well, it's just, when you question anything and you believe anything other than what you're being told, you're a fucking asshole. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, man!  So it's just like, just go with the flow.  You know what I mean?  Like, when they're telling you to get in the cattle car because you're being shipped off, just get in and go.  You know what I mean?  Because whatever they tell you is the truth.  It's a Kwan-spiracy, spiracy, spiracy.  Nice. 
[00:31:00]  So just get in the cattle car?  No, that's no conspiracy.  Let's just go with the flow.  That's what you're saying.  Let's do whatever you're told.  It's better to do that than question things?  Yeah, of course.  It's just a lot easier.  We need people like you, though, Troy, to question things.  Ah, why?  Why do it?  Sorry about you guys.  What's everything?  MSNBC?  Let's say on the next Susan Boyle?  No.  Wow.  Why is this?  Because, you know, ugly people are not supposed to be talented, remember?  Jimmy made that point perfectly clear on this show. 
[00:31:30]  It's true.  If you're ugly...  My parents made it to me when I was small.  If you're ugly, society has already decided that you have no fucking value.  Your value is...  Right?  Fucking assholes.  Like, the funny thing is, nobody cares that this guy shits his pants.  Oh my god!  He could sell Tide!  Right.  He sounds like a radio guy!  It's amazing.  If you're an ugly fucking pig, society has decided you have no worth.  You're worthless.  Zero value.  Fucking mainstream media sucks at big. 
[00:32:00]  Let people step over you.  Like, I'm happy for this guy.  But the funny thing is, we're interested in him because he sounds like a good radio guy.  Right.  We're just a silly country.  And you know all these stories never end happily.  No.  There's going to be some horrible thing in his past that they have to awkwardly bring up  in another day or two.  He molested a child and threw him into a meat grinder.  Right.  They've been looking for him for five years.  Who wants to bet that this ends horribly?  That he's got some baggage.  Oh, fuck yeah.  He's got some skeletons.  I'm going on record right now. 
[00:32:30]  None of these stories ever end up happily.  They always have to dig, dig, dig until they fucking kill you.  And that's what they'll do with this homeless Ted Williams guy.  They'll prop him up on a little pedestal for a while.  Right.  And be like, you know, he'll do the talk show circuit and be on Fox and Friends.  He'll end up on Letterman by tomorrow.  And then they'll dig something up like, he has an arrest record for touching children.  Sure.  Oh, boy.  Sure.  And that's probably why he doesn't have a job in radio. 
[00:33:00]  But back to Troy Clark, because he has questions.  Have you heard any more about the birds?  Why are you giving up?  Because a few fans are beating you up?  No, no, it's fine.  I mean, it's just, like I said, it's just a lot easier to go with the flow.  He's not giving up.  Don't give up.  He's not giving up.  But it's so much easier, though.  You know what I mean?  We're pushing you.  He's not capable of giving up.  He could say he's going to give up.  We like that you have questions, but we don't like that you have no substance behind the  fact you have questions.  Here's the honest to God truth.  With conspiracy theories, I can only take so much of it, because then I, it just, it becomes 
[00:33:30]  too much.  Because there's so many people that devote their lives to this, and you, you just become  so, so involved with it.  And you just, I can't do it.  Honestly, I can't do it.  In order to wake up in the morning and be excited about life and excited about what I have going  on, I just, I can't do it.  But what is a conspiracy theory?  It's a quonspiracy, spiracy, spiracy.  Like, no echo.  No echo.  Jesus, Danny. 
[00:34:00]  Danny just repeated himself.  That's the best.  No, it's more fun that way.  It certainly is.  What's, I have a question for Troy.  Love that.  What's, what's a conspiracy, sorry, a quonspiracy theory that even you find ridiculous?  Like, is there one that you even look at and go, who the fuck believes that shit?  Uh, as far as, like, drinking water and, and poisoning us through drinking water, I mean,  like the fluoride.  See, that one I believe. 
[00:34:30]  Or we for a we.  Which, what are we talking about?  Yeah, as far as fluoride and what they're, they're putting in your drinking water.  Um, I mean, but, but then again, man, I don't know.  I don't do tests on it.  You know, you just, you, there are people that say that the drinking water's fine, and there  are people that say, look, this is what's in it.  This is what this is doing to you.  So hang on, you're buying into the drinking water thing, too, then?  No, I'm just saying it's, it's hard to believe that.  He's got questions.  I like Troy.  He's a lazy conspiracy theorist.  He really is.  Like, he doesn't read anything.  Yeah, but that's what they all are.  But that's, that is a conspiracy theorist.  But I'm not in here claiming to be a conspiracy theorist. 
[00:35:00]  But that's why we want you to be better than the average conspiracy guy.  Yeah.  But I'm not, I'm not claiming to do that.  I've told you that I've, I've watched, I've watched some of Alex Jones' movies, and, and  they're, they're cool.  I mean, they're, they're fascinating.  Did you hear him on our show yesterday?  I watched some of Steven Spielberg's movies.  They're fascinating, too.  Okay, and that's fine.  And when he does a documentary, you could go, oh, you know what?  That's, that's a good point.  Yeah, but a documentary is, is still biased.  A documentary is just presenting the facts the way that the documentary maker wants you  to see those facts.  Right.  I found 9-1-1 was biased.  So you could say that about anything. 
[00:35:30]  I love King of Kong.  I'm not going to, it's, it's extremely skewed, one-sided.  I mean, that's obvious.  But you know what?  It's entertaining.  Right.  A documentary is still entertainment.  Well, I'm not, I'm not in here trying to sell you on what he's saying.  I'm just saying, I find this interesting.  Yeah, but don't, don't tell me to watch an Alex Jones documentary.  Did I tell you that?  You didn't watch this yet.  Did I tell you to watch it?  You're going to be blown away.  But when did I tell you to watch it?  You're bringing it up.  You're saying, well, you got to see this.  I said, I found it.  Why are you so confrontational?  Why are you?  I'm just asking a question.  Yeah, and I'm answering it.  This is a fight now.  What is this?  Oh, it's a rule.  I just tried to be like, I just, I wanted to have a back and forth. 
[00:36:00]  And we are.  Yeah.  Am I?  Well, I'm just, I'm asking because I didn't tell you to watch shit.  But you brought up his documentary.  I said, I found it interesting.  All right.  But I'm saying that not just because it's a documentary doesn't make it fact.  Did I say that?  You were implying.  I said it was, I found it fascinating.  You implied it.  When did I say, how do you imply when I say I found it fascinating?  Because you brought it up.  Awkward.  It's not awkward.  It's not awkward.  Not at all.  They're asking me to come in and talk about it.  Am I running in here to talk about how great Alex Jones is? 
[00:36:30]  Dude, why are you being like this now?  We're just talking about this.  I'm just talking.  Wow.  I don't think, I don't think Troy likes the drop.  Maybe we should.  I love the drop.  Play it again.  It's a Quonspiracy, Spiracy, Spiracy.  By the way, Troy, if Travis comes in here, are you wearing a cup?  I think so.  Yeah, I'm ready.  I'm ready.  Just making sure.  Yeah.  I want to thank Travis for that.  Here's the problem with conspiracy.  Jesse Ventura is not lazy.  Like, he's not a lazy conspiracy guy.  Yes, I am.  And neither is Alex Jones. 
[00:37:00]  But those guys are agenda obsessed.  Like, they're obsessed with the conspiracy, be it a conspiracy, otherwise they're identities.  I'm running out of conspiracies.  And Alex Jones is lazy.  He's useless until noon every day.  Well, yeah, that was funny.  You heard him on the show yesterday?  That was hysterical.  He didn't even know he was on the radio.  Yeah.  And then hung up and said, I need five minutes and never called us back, by the way.  But just imagine how intense that guy's life is.  I mean, to constantly be, eat, sleeping, and breathing conspiracy theory.  I don't think he believes it.  I think it's an act.  Yeah, let me tell you what I think about Alex Jones.  And basically said it.  I think he believes only half of the shit he says on his show. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And without the passion that he puts across on the air.  Like Art Bell.  Yeah.  He believes a bunch of it, sure.  But then he knows what his audience wants, and he goes all in.  I would love, if you got him at a bar and said, look, between me and you, he would  say, yeah, half that shit I don't really believe.  I would love to see somebody take something that he said and prove him wrong.  I really would.  No, I would like to see him prove what he says right.  It's all speculation based on some theory. 
[00:38:00]  That's why it's theories.  When the other side presents facts, the conspiracy side presents theories, and people pick up on  it because they always say that the government or this overseeing body entity is the one that's  blocking the information from really getting out there.  So they got to dig and dig.  But they never come up with any solid evidence.  9-11 is the prime example.  That is the prime example of conspiracy people gone nuts because there's absolute evidence 
[00:38:30]  of everything that they say is a conspiracy, yet they refute it all with just speculation.  And in true conspiracy theorist fashion, the minute they are presented with facts or logic  or physics, they just get angry and start yelling.  And they change the subject and go something.  They try to make it like they're going deeper behind what you said.  Meanwhile, they just shoved off what you said.  And it's funny because I saw a documentary about why conspiracy theorists feel the need  to get you on their side also.  And it all boils down to they need this passion in their life for something. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, for anything.  So they go and they attach themselves to these situations because they feel something for  it.  Even though it's not genuine, they could suck onto that feeling for a little bit and make  them feel full of that movement that's important.  They're married to the idea of the conspiracy being a conspiracy.  They're not looking to find the facts.  No, no.  The conspiracy, and I know that because when we had 9-11 people on, I remember the Pentagon.  I had certain questions about it. 
[00:39:30]  I'm like, yeah, they actually raised some good points.  But then I took it a step further and I talked to people and I read stuff and I, and I, after  like weighing everything, I just believed it actually did hit the Pentagon.  And after, those, the conspiracy theorists themselves, by the babyish way of arguing and they're  ignoring certain facts, they convinced me that the fucking, it exactly was the way the government  said it was.  And what we all knew it was.  It was a plane that hit the Pentagon.  Because when certain facts were presented, they were like, I didn't want to go. 
[00:40:00]  Why didn't they find any parts of an airplane?  But they did.  And they did.  They did.  They absolutely did.  But where is it documented, though?  Where are the pictures?  Everywhere.  Go ahead.  It's a conspiracy.  Spiracy.  Spiracy.  And don't show me the piece of aluminum siding to a plane sitting in the yard as concrete  evidence.  No, I'll show you the damage.  Like, I could show you a computer animation of exactly the damage that occurred and then  side-by-side shots of the actual real damage that happened. 
[00:40:30]  How about a landing gear?  How about parts of the fuselage?  And what's wrong with parts of the fuselage being spread out over the site?  And parts of the landing gear that match up exactly to the plane?  And, you know, there are things that are fascinating with the Twin Towers.  Oh, sorry.  Supposedly, you know, they found one of the hijackers' passports.  So, how does a passport, which is paper, go through an explosion, there's an explosion, 
[00:41:00]  the plane crashes in, and somehow, and the passport's probably in the guy's bag, how  does a passport go through the bag, through the plane, through the explosion, and end out  on the street?  It got blown out, and Troy, that's such an odd thing to find, that they, there's such  an easier way to plant evidence than we found a passport that blew out of a plane, like that 
[00:41:30]  is such a, somebody obviously found it, it was one of those things that just, when the  explosion, I have paper from the Trade Center, I actually have something from 144 in my apartment  that, uh, paper blew out of the thing, and it happens, it's an odd thing to happen.  And that's fine, but for me, personally, I find it hard to believe.  You find that hard to believe, even though there's other evidence that Mohammed Atta was  on that fucking plane.  Like a video of him in one of Ben Lydon's.  There's plenty of evidence.  You don't just have to take, if you just had to take the passport and say, hey, look, 
[00:42:00]  uh, wow, Mr. Passion over here.  Me?  Why are you so, why are you so passionate about it?  I just, because you say, you say things that make me insane.  Well, then you just go, ah, because you just said, you just said it was hard to believe.  Troy, Troy, Troy, Troy, you believe, you believe that fucking, that the government is putting  aluminum chips in the sky, but, but a fucking passport on the floor is hard to believe.  That's ridiculous to me.  And we don't know.  Why is one thing more ridiculous than the other?  We don't know if the passport was in a fucking front car with you.  Don't touch me.  I don't want you to touch me.  Oh my god.  Why don't you touch me? 
[00:42:30]  I don't want you, who the fuck are you going to be touching me?  I'm trying to talk to you.  You don't have to touch me.  You can talk to me and not talk to me.  Why is he doing this?  You say this?  Because what, what's your problem?  I'm not, I'm trying to have a fun talk about conspiracy theories.  Is it fun?  Yeah, it is fun.  Is this fun?  When you go, when I say something, you go.  Because you said it was, because you said it was hard to believe.  Meanwhile, everything that you, that you defend is incredibly hard to believe.  I think that's a solid point.  Okay, well, they've done research to find aluminum in rainwater.  Okay, and they did research that, that they found Atta's passport.  I don't think one thing is more ridiculous than the other. 
[00:43:00]  I'm trying to make, I think they're equally ridiculous.  Well, I got your point.  It is kind of odd, though, that you would, this is the point.  It's hard to believe that they, this passport, it is a hard thing to,  that is kind of an odd thing to have happen, they find a passport.  Yeah.  But yet, conspiracy theorists buy into the fact that 210-story buildings were wired with explosives.  Right, now what's more ridiculous?  The thing is, it is the way the facts are looked at, it's agenda-driven.  That's what I find difficult.  Yes, they try to make their own story make sense instead of looking for the facts. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  That's what I see a lot.  And you hear the bullshit repeated, like with Kennedy, like, oh, Oswald was the good shot.  You hear that repeated by everyone.  It's like, they actually watch Oliver Stone's movie and then just repeat what they heard.  And think that's the history of it.  And they also make, like, the passport story better.  Who says it was in a bag?  It could have just been in his front pocket.  Which makes it a little easier.  To make it through an explosion in the building, crumbling?  A lot of shit made it through the explosion from the plane.  I think all the fuel was well behind Mohammed Atta. 
[00:44:00]  He was in the front of the plane.  And a paper passport is going to make it through that big ball of flame.  No, no, the flame, the force of an explosion could easily blow somebody's possessions out of the plane.  Out of the plane.  And it's such an odd thing to have happen.  To find the passport.  To think that that would be their evidence.  Aha, see?  When they could have just as easily forged a note and left it in a hijacker's car at the airport.  I've never seen a picture of the passport.  No, but I've heard they found it. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, I did too.  Is it fucking burnt?  Is there just a piece of it that they recognize as Mohammed Atta's?  Like, I don't know.  Do you know, Troy?  I don't know.  I know that they've said they found it.  But I've yet to see it.  And there's video and other records of him boarding this fucking plane.  They know he was the guy that flew that plane.  And I'm not trying to convince you that it was remote control airplanes and the real planes landed.  I don't know.  A lot of people say, too, maybe our government just looked the other way and let this happen. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  That would be more viable.  That's something you could actually go, all right, maybe.  But, again, that involves people keeping their mouths shut and meh.  Right.  I can't see people doing that.  They can't keep their mouths shut about anything.  People are fucking blabber mouths.  And there's so many easier ways to accomplish, to think that this dumb government would actually 
[00:45:30]  figure out, would actually plant a passport and go, see, that was the guy in the 90s.  It's like, it's preposterous.  It's such an odd thing to find.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable that they would find that.  Yeah.  They wouldn't plant that.  You plant a note in the hijacker's car.  It's that simple.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They'd kill everybody.  Right.  Oh, look what we found.  It's so much easier.  That's fine.  It's still, it's a hard thing to believe.  All right.  But this was about the birds.  Yeah.  I don't know much about the birds.  I mean, it's probably fireworks or lightning.  That's my guess.  Are you giving up, though?  No.  I mean, it's, you know, look.  I don't know.  I'm not a scientist.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist. 
[00:46:00]  Yes, you are.  I'm just thinking if it was some kind of gas or something, more than 5,000 birds would have  been killed if there's millions in the sky.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Don't you think?  Yeah.  It's something odd.  Or did those birds have a weaker immune system when the gas got to them?  Dude, you know what conspiracy theorists have, too?  And it's a weird thing.  And I'm not saying everyone for every conspiracy.  But it's a weird, almost a safety, that this stuff is being controlled by someone.  It's almost a weird comfort in the fact that somebody is controlling things. 
[00:46:30]  Like, they said on 9-11, like, the idea that we were that vulnerable and got fucked  that hard and genuinely couldn't stop it is frightening.  The idea that the government did it and couldn't is somehow oddly comforting that even though  the government is shit, at least they are in charge and protecting us.  There was an ugly fear that, God Almighty, we really did get our dick in our ass and did  nothing about it to stop it.  We always thought there was some kind of safety in place.  We always thought it could be stopped.  And more importantly, Homeless Ted Williams is on CNN. 
[00:47:00]  Now on CNN.  They're showing the video on CNN.  This thing has exploded.  And I'm telling you, this is going to end ugly for Ted Williams.  I'm telling you.  There's something else going on.  Someone actually said, really fast, because it's on TV, Mike in Boston, go ahead, real fast.  Hey guys, if you replay the audio, when the Homeless guy's talking about how he got his training  and his education and his voice and all that other stuff, he then says he got into alcohol, 
[00:47:30]  drugs, and some other things.  Some other things is what they're going to look into.  What does he have going on there?  Those other things are what's going to get him.  I think a lot of media outlets are going to awkwardly cancel their interviews with Ted Williams  within the next few hours.  We are not going to be speaking with him today.  Something suddenly came up.  What do you think it's going to be?  Sex offense.  Really?  You're going sex offense?  I'm going sex offense.  Maybe.  Look at this.  They got Scott. 
[00:48:00]  This guy's from Magic.  They got this guy.  We have all the details coming up in the set.  All right, whatever.  Yeah, they're all talking to this guy today.  Jeannie Moose is on it.  We lose on this one.  We try to get him on our show, but we're way late to the party.  All right, Troy.  All right.  We want you to continue having questions.  Just keep thinking.  Because there are people out there.  I could go to the phones.  They're with you.  Yeah.  They have questions, too.  I don't like that you just gave up on the birds thing within a day. 
[00:48:30]  You felt the pressure of the radio show.  He's being sarcastic.  He absolutely is not giving up on the birds.  All right, so what do you really think is happening with the birds?  Say it.  You got me, man.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  Stand firm.  How come you don't yell at him like you're yelling at me?  Because he doesn't sit there and go, every time I say something.  Well, you say dumb shit.  That makes that, it elicits that response.  What's a dumb shit?  You're saying that I'm saying shit and that didn't even happen, Danny.  You're like, oh, I'm telling you to watch this.  I didn't tell you to watch it.  Why are you so mad at me today?  Because every time I come in here and I say something that you don't like, this is what  you do.  Here, ready? 
[00:49:00]  That's not ever what I do.  Oh, shit.  Not only have I never done that.  And then you huff and you puff.  Not only have I never done that.  You're going to keep talking?  You're going to keep talking?  There's no possibility just to have a regular discussion with you.  That's what I was trying to do.  Because you have little temper tantrums, Danny.  This is fucking radio.  This is what radio is.  You have fun conversations full of energy with other people.  You don't just sit there and go, yes, no, yes.  Why do these guys not throw temper tantrums in?  No one's throwing temper tantrums.  No one is throwing temper tantrums.  You do.  And when I put the mic to the side, it's because I don't want to be, because the mic is on. 
[00:49:30]  I want to get the fuck away from me.  All right.  That's why I put the mic over there.  But there's a way of doing it like this and then throwing it.  Because you're pissed off about something.  You are so fucking wrong, bro.  Am I bro?  Am I bro?  Bro?  Not mine.  I don't know what you are.  Well, you just called me bro.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to.  Am I bro?  I didn't mean it.  It's a theory.  Oh, wow.  Must be a theory.  We'll debunk it.  All right.  Oh, man.  Love you, Danny.  Cool.  Can't even look over there right now.  All right.  Who's getting an extended vacation from this conversation?  Hopefully me. 
[00:50:00]  I predict the hospital stay.  It's a conspiracy.  Doesn't help that Danny made those, does it, Troy?  Oh, that's cool.  I love it.  Do another one.  Do another one.  All right, Troy.  Thanks.  There goes Troy.  All his music is playing.  That's all.  Oh, that's funny.  That's all the funny stuff.  He's not happy.  Oh, man.  Well, you know what it is?  I just don't think he can't do that to you guys, so I'm the only one in the room. 
[00:50:30]  That's all.  You can, uh...  Please.  Well, Sam was saying that it was easy to get him a little off kilter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Troy's a psychopath.  I think so, too.  I think so, too.  There's something going on there, man.  I don't know.  There's something going on under that great head of hair.  Yeah.  I love it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Louis C.K. is here today.  Is he here now?  It's been a while. 
[00:51:00]  I don't know.  Very good.  We'll take a look during the break and see.  He might be the hottest comedian in the country.  Might.  How about he is?  He is fucking on fire.  How about he is?  His appearances on TV are just fucking going viral left and right, man.  He's hysterical.  But, I mean, he's selling out.  He's doing 3,000 seats everywhere.  His fucking film in Canada.  His stand-up film.  He's on fire, man.  I saw him at Carnegie Hall.  Fuck.  Standing ovation.  Just him and a stool.  How do you do that at Carnegie Hall?  Don't you need a big orchestra behind you to get a standing ovation? 
[00:51:30]  I think so.  Right?  He kicks ass.  Unbelievable.  So, we'll talk to Louis next.  We've got lots of other things to do.  Where is he?  They're just people's comments that I saw.  Where's Louis?  He can't win.  I don't know.  Is he here?  He's not here.  Oh, he's not here.  It's 7 to 7.30.  We'll have him when he gets there.  You all right?  He's here.  I'm making sure.  He's right there behind you.  No, it's not.  See, though.  He's right there.  He's walking down the hall.  Oh, look.  To this day, I'm mad at Gray Wolf. 
[00:52:00]  We had a hit on our hands.  We needed another verse.  And we tried for years, and it just never happened.  That thing would have been a huge fucking radio hit.  That's why he was a bum.  Gray Wolf, homeless at the time, sang that song for Tippy Tom, who obviously is now dead,  unfortunately, our favorite homeless person of all time.  Then maybe he can finish the song now, finally.  We've tried.  We've put him in studios.  It's ridiculous.  That can be done. 
[00:52:30]  That can absolutely be done.  We've tried.  Many different ways.  It just falls short every time.  We've had him in our studio.  Like, hey, man, just try to come up with something else.  Drew Boogie took him in the studio.  I think we took him in a studio here, like in a production room.  We just tried.  Just could never, ever complete that song, unfortunately.  Can I answer a question that everybody's been asking me?  Yes!  It's about Atlantic City, the Late Show, January 15th.  I'm not plugging it. 
[00:53:00]  It is almost sold out.  It's not quite sold out.  The Late Show's a tough sell, but we are extremely close.  I don't remember people asking about it.  You're not plugging it.  Where were they asking?  Oh, okay.  No, I don't care.  People go.  So, me, Burr, Attell, and Jim Brewer.  And it's almost sold out for the Late Show.  The first two are obviously completely sold, and the third will sell out.  And other dates may be added in other places.  If they're...  That's exciting.  If it's not completely sold out yet, you should probably plug it at some point. 
[00:53:30]  Nah.  They want to go to the Borgata.com for other reasons.  That's their business.  All right.  I don't encourage people to go buy my show.  That's noble of you to just not even plug it.  Forget I even said it.  I want to bring up Brewer for a second.  Who?  Burr?  Jim Brewer.  Oh, Brewer.  He did the 25 Days of Christmas on YouTube.  Those videos should have got way more views than it did.  Fucking hilarious.  And it also shows that Brewer's a psychopath.  Oh, we all knew that.  He plays a different character in every fucking video. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  He's completely insane.  Yeah, we all know he's...  You might want to search that out if you're a big Jim Brewer fan, because the videos really,  really are well done and not doing too well.  I hope the language isn't salty in them.  No.  Salty language.  Relatively clean.  A little crazy.  But he plays a cougar.  He plays so many different characters.  Laugh Out Loud Funny by our pal Jim Brewer.  What else is going on, Ant?  Oh, I saw that Wall Street 2 last night. 
[00:54:30]  Michael Douglas?  So that...  Yeah, Michael Douglas.  What do you think?  I hate that Shiloh Bullf guy.  I don't like that Shiloh Bullf.  I don't like that Shiloh Bullf.  I don't find him very credible as an actor.  Fuck, man.  They love him, though, for some reason.  I know.  He's everywhere.  But it worked, I guess.  I would have liked to have seen somebody else in that.  Mikey Schroeder, maybe?  I thought it was really good.  What's Ricky doing these days? 
[00:55:00]  Why not Ricky Schroeder?  It's Rick Schroeder.  Bad suggestion, guy.  Let's get it going.  Why not Ricky Schroeder?  Let's get that on the internet.  A little predictable, but...  Yeah.  But, yeah, it was kind of cool.  It was kind of fun to see Michael Douglas in that role again.  Is it a drop-off from the first movie?  Yeah, you know, it's very hard to make a sequel that is as good as the original, but...  Is his cell phone smaller? 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  That's all I need to know.  And they do make reference to his big phone.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, cell phone.  Yeah, yeah, which is kind of funny.  Oh, that's good, because that's...  Yeah, yeah, you get to see it again.  What do you mean?  Oh, they show the video of him on the beach with the big cell phone?  No, it's when he's getting out of prison at the beginning, and they're giving him his  stuff.  Oh, they give him the big cell phone back?  And he goes, and one cell phone, click, and they clunk the big one down.  That's great.  Big, dumb cell phone.  That's what takes you out of the movie when you go back and see the original Wall Street. 
[00:56:00]  He's walking on the beach with that giant thing, get three minutes of talk time on  it, I'm sure.  Right.  Wow.  That is an amazingly big phone.  Like, you know how they go in and they put the fucking, the guns, they take the guns  out of the hands and like E.T., they should actually just replace that with something  smaller.  With a gun.  Like a Victrola.  Right.  A Victrola.  That thing.  And also, you gotta remember, when the original Wall Street was, you know, out there, no one  had cell phones. 
[00:56:30]  That's what made that so amazing.  Well, that's a home phone.  That's not a cell phone, is it?  That's a home phone.  That's a cell phone.  That's a cell phone.  That's one of the first cell phones, portable cell phones that you walked around with.  That only really, really, really rich people had.  For the most part, people had cell phones, but they had car phones.  You didn't even call it a cell phone.  You said, yeah, I got a car phone.  And it had the little pigtail antenna on the rear view, rear window or something.  Right.  And in the J.C.  Whitney catalog, which was a great catalog if you wanted to soup up your car with something, 
[00:57:00]  you used to get the J.C.  Whitney catalog.  And I would thumb through that going like, oh, I'd love to have that for my Chevelle or  something.  It was just a bunch of crap that you put on your car.  They'd sell these fake pigtail antennas that you put on your car to make people think  you had a car phone.  I remember that shit.  So you'd be driving and people would actually, they would look over like, well, that guy's  got a fucking car phone, motherfucker.  Wouldn't that make people break into your fucking car? 
[00:57:30]  Nah, it was the point people didn't even know what to do with these things.  Right.  You're going to steal them?  What are you going to do with it?  You got to get something out of service.  I don't know.  But it was a car phone hooked into your battery.  It was hardwired in.  My father had one out in California when I went out there back in the 80s.  And I was calling my friends.  And I'm like, you know, I'm driving this big fucking suburban, whatever it was.  Old school.  No, an old blazer.  It was an old blazer with the top off and shit. 
[00:58:00]  I used to love my blazer.  I mean, this was an old big four wheel drive blazer, like a 70s version.  Square, right?  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  Big four wheel drive.  And I'm like, yeah, what's up, man?  Where am I?  I'm cruising around in Bainer Park right now.  I think I'm, I don't even know where the fuck I am, but I'm on the phone in a car.  And my father's like, did you make calls?  Do you realize it's like $18 a second for this fucking thing?  Whether you get a call or make a call, it's just crazy. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  So, uh, yeah.  So they, they, they showed that in the movie, which was good.  I thought it was kind of funny, but the movie was good.  Decent, decent movie.  You won't watch it and go like, oh, that sucks.  Yeah.  Which to me is a good movie these days.  If you just hangs there, I think.  Cause people don't really talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They didn't say it sucked, but they're not like real excited about it.  And I wasn't, uh, I wasn't at the point where I needed to see it when it came out.  I waited for a cave and not, not like, you know, true grit.  I wanted to see right, right away.  And people have, now that people are seeing it more and more, they're commenting on how, 
[00:59:00]  uh, he, he does sound exactly like Carl from Sling Blade.  The true grit.  When he's talking.  Jeff Bridges and, uh, Jeff Bridges.  Jeff Bridges is like, uh, the man now though.  He's in a lot of shit.  He's getting, uh, accolades.  Yeah, man.  Could be, um, I would think for true grit.  Also, I, I, I do think I see some Academy Award material in there.  Oh, shit, we're talking Oscars already.  I think I see some Academy Award material in there. 
[00:59:30]  Some acting is very good.  The girl was very good, I thought, uh, in that movie.  I haven't seen it yet.  It's my little movie break.  That's cool.  Yeah.  What was I going to say?  Oh, someone's calling your white trash because of the J.C., uh, Whitney catalog.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Long Island.  I live on Long Island.  But it brings up a good, uh.  I love that J.C.  Whitney catalog when I was growing up.  Brings a good topic to the table.  The dumbest gadget for your car that, that was out there.  Oh, the J.C.  Whitney catalog was full of them.  Do you remember the one where you, you mounted it and it was, uh, I want to say it was, uh, 
[01:00:00]  uh, uh, a bomb sound effect, I think.  Oh, yeah.  And you pushed it if someone was pissing you off in traffic.  And it would be like, but, but they, of course, the person pissing you off wouldn't hear it.  It's just you and in your stupid car.  Yeah.  You can believe you're, you're firing missiles at the car.  Do you remember that?  Oh, yes.  It was horrible.  Is that the sound it made?  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  It made some bad fucking Atari sound.  If we could find that on, that would be great.  I'm trying to think of some of the other dumb fucking gadgets they had.  Yeah.  There were a lot of them, uh, in that stupid catalog, like bolt-on accessories, things that  were supposed to make your car look better.  Right.  A lot of spoilers.  Yeah.  People like those spoilers.  Um, yeah, God, I'm trying to think of some of those.  We could start with like the bumper bra, obviously, that dumb thing. 
[01:01:00]  Remember that?  Yeah.  That was just, looked exhausting to put on your car.  Yeah.  Uh, the, um,  there was a little sign that you would hold up and, and flip things over.  Like, Hey, you cut me off.  Oh, really?  Why you?  That wasn't even electronic.  Here we go.  They're, they're calling, uh, Joe in Boston.  Joe.  Hey, what's up guys?  Yeah.  When you have a turbo in your car, it spools up and makes this noise.  Well, they used to sell this speaker you'd mount on the inside of the engine compartment. 
[01:01:30]  And when you hit a button, it would make that fucking noise.  Make it fake turbo sound.  That was great.  Later guys.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  I think we gave up on all those gadgets.  What was, uh, what was the decade for the gadgets?  80s, maybe?  80s, 70s, uh, late 70s, 80s.  That was, um.  When the 90s hit, they finally said enough of this horse shit.  I got the Baja, I got the Baja bug kit for my Volkswagen.  I used to go out and buy like a 67, 66 Volkswagen Beetle and, uh, just take the saws all to it. 
[01:02:00]  And then you bolt on these fiberglass fenders and, um, and the, the back, you cut the whole back so the engine was exposed, cut the front off and put the nose piece on.  And, and, uh, I had one of those for, for quite a while.  Uh, and that came from the JC Whitney catalog.  I was so excited when it showed up.  I could imagine.  Oh, like a kid in a candy store. 
[01:02:30]  Let's say hi to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hey, what about the double wiper blades that had the loopers on them?  Yeah, the loopers.  Oh, right.  Those were the faster you drove.  They were supposed to hold the wiper blade closer to your windshield tighter.  Right, right, right.  And, and rear window louvers were big, too.  Bolt on rear window louvers.  And the, of course, install it yourself moonroof that would leak like it was raining in your car.  What do you mean you installed it yourself?  Oh, yeah.  You had to cut the hole. 
[01:03:00]  They'd give you a template and you fucking put it on the roof.  Yeah, the, I don't remember that.  And you get your saws all and you fucking cut that shit out.  Louis C.K.  Let's just get to the studio.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, you cut it out and then it never looked good.  The headliner inside the car would all start falling down.  Oh, of course.  It could come out from the flange because it was never tight enough.  It was never watertight.  How'd you cut the hole?  With a saws all.  You had to have that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You gotta, you know, you gotta have your equipment.  You had to have your tools to put in your own stuff.  Oh, the sunroof. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  A lot of that good shit, though.  Fucking Louis, man.  You're, like, really famous now.  Yeah, I know.  When he walks, you're, like, really famous.  I'm like, holy shit.  He's looking a little different.  I got a little nervous.  I got a little nervous.  I was like, ah, shit.  He's had Louis on so many times, but now I'm looking at him differently, like, God, he's  really famous.  That's that Louis C.K.  guy.  I watch his show.  He does a Leno show, and then that clip goes viral.  And holy shit, you're famous.  Crazy.  I'm not famous.  Funny or die loves you.  I am not famous.  I'm not.  You're really famous. 
[01:04:00]  Nah, you're pretty fucking famous.  No.  Holy shit, you're famous.  Yeah, no, I mean, we won't jinx it for you, but yeah, you got it.  I'm surprised you're even here.  You're that famous.  You're not supposed to do the show anymore.  You're that famous.  It's so funny how people don't ever see the cycle coming.  You know what I mean?  Oh, the up and down?  Yeah.  I mean, I see it.  I see it already.  I already see the horizon.  Do you see the horizon?  Do you see the dip?  Yeah, the not sun rising on the horizon.  I already see it.  I saw you at Carnegie Hall. 
[01:04:30]  I didn't want to bother you after the show.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking standing ovation.  That was pretty fun, man.  But it's just you dressed like shit and a stool getting a standing ovation.  I'm like, shouldn't there be an orchestra or something to get a standing ovation?  Yes.  No, I'm wearing the same right now, the same clothes I wore.  Yeah, you didn't dress up for Carnegie Hall.  Why would you?  I pulled this shit on to be on the radio.  I wore the same thing for Carnegie Hall.  I was amazed.  Like, that's why Louie's as good as he is, because he's not dressed up for Carnegie Hall.  That's right? 
[01:05:00]  Never.  Never.  And the thing is, when I play, I play rooms that size.  Like, the tour I just finished was all rooms that size or bigger.  In Chicago, I did the Chicago Theater.  I did two shows there.  Wow.  How big is that?  That's like 3,600 seats.  So it was like 7,000 people in one night.  And it was the perfect way to get ready for Carnegie Hall, is that by the time I got there,  I'm like, well, I've been doing this kind of room.  But nothing prepares you for that place, because Chicago Theater, it's enormous, it's beautiful, 
[01:05:30]  but it's in the middle of shit Chicago.  And the dressing room is peeling paint, and, you know, Joey Ramone signed the coffee table.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, whatever.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  But you go to Carnegie Hall, and they show you into the Maestro Suite, which has this  gold plaque on it.  Holy shit.  This guy bows as you walk through the fucking door, and it's like, oh, my God, there's  a whole other.  And you're, I mean, if, you know, like, if Yo-Yo Ma plays there, he doesn't go to the 
[01:06:00]  Maestro Suite.  He probably goes to the fucking musician room.  Right, right.  You're the Maestro Suite.  You're the main guy.  You're the guy.  George Gershwin fucking got blown in there.  And so, yeah, it's a whole other level.  Really, it was such a great show.  And I want to give props to Ted Alexandro.  Is he doing all your?  I hired him.  For the tour?  No, he did.  I toured with him some last year, and this year I worked with Todd Glass a lot and some  other guys. 
[01:06:30]  But I saw Ted.  I just want to give him props.  He was a funny dude, man.  Well, and he didn't know.  I hired him the day before.  To do Carnegie?  Yeah.  What an asshole.  I know.  What an asshole you are.  I couldn't decide who to open for me, and I figured I can get anybody, but then I got  close, and I'm like, no, folks aren't really actually available.  Right.  And I wrote Ted.  I love Ted.  I just couldn't decide.  And then I wrote him the day before and said, I need you at 8 o'clock tomorrow at 57th Street  and 6th Avenue.  That's all I said to him. 
[01:07:00]  And he's smart.  He looked it up.  I'm playing the coffee shop.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, he's really, it was funny, because he just wrote back, okay.  And that was it.  Like, he knew what it was.  He just went, okay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And you know, he was shitting his pants.  Yeah, exactly.  He was writing, okay.  But he wore a suit, and his dad came.  It was great to have Ted got there.  Did you feel bad not having a suit?  I wear that sometimes, and I'm like, it doesn't feel right.  But you just do it because you're like, I think I'm supposed to.  You feel obligated.  Well, I want to wear a suit. 
[01:07:30]  I wish I could wear a suit.  Like, the image in my head of being on stage in a suit and tie is really cool.  That's clays.  Yeah, that's clays.  That's all clays.  But then when I wear one, I feel just weird, and my shirt starts coming out of my pants,  and I don't.  Wear a t-shirt under it.  Like, I don't wear a tie.  I can't wear a tie.  It's too fucking restrictive.  Honestly, it works for Lou.  It really does.  It just works.  I wish I could dress up.  I just don't, I don't, I don't pull it off, and I wish I did.  I think your act and your personality is more conducive to just casual wear. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, last time I did the Tonight Show, I brought a suit and tie, and I put it on.  And said, fuck this?  And then the last second, I was like, fucking, what's his name, in cold blood, pulling off  my, you know, having to pee before I get hung.  I just ripped everything off and ran out.  Good for you.  Yeah, I can't do it.  But, you know, first time I did Letterman, I wore a suit, and I remember Mitch, what's 
[01:08:30]  his name, the comedian here.  Hedberg?  Yeah, yeah.  He came up to me and said, why'd you wear a suit?  You don't wear suits.  And I was like, well, it's a respect for the institution.  To me, doing Letterman was like graduating from something.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, that's phony.  If you ever, if I did Letterman, I wear sneakers and jeans.  I'm like, well, go ahead.  I don't know.  I wanted to wear a suit.  It's like, well, it's just, this isn't you.  And I'm like, well.  And then he did Letterman, he wore a fucking suit.  He did.  Yeah.  What a downer, though. 
[01:09:00]  It's like, hey, I'm trying to enjoy my moment.  I love how people have these phony rebellions.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, you and Anne Frank really.  I got to ask you about the TV show.  Where are we at?  The first season was a huge hit.  Yeah, it did really great.  I mean, you know, only 14 people watched those things.  But it was well-liked by all 14 of us.  You did numbers, didn't you?  Yeah, we did well for cable.  Yeah, we did great.  FX is a perfect place for you.  I wouldn't want more people to have access to the show, honestly. 
[01:09:30]  I really wouldn't.  People would start pitching.  Yeah, like we're doing a second season, and we're moving to 10.30 from 11,  just inching back a half an hour.  Oh, kind of sneaking.  At first they said, let's go to 10.  10 is technically kind of primetime television.  So they're going to move it to 10.  And because the show, the numbers for the show are strong enough to move it to 10.  That's what they told me.  To then grow it.  And then they said, we're doing 10.30.  And I'm like, what happened to 10?  They said, well, no, there's, we can't. 
[01:10:00]  Your show can't.  They said, believe me, you're better off.  Well, you don't want them fucking with it.  You don't want them moving it to 10 and then going, all right, well, you can't do this.  You can't do that.  You have total freedom, dude.  I'm exactly, if I was on any of the network at any other time period, I would not be able  to do this.  Yeah.  Show the way it is.  Because the advertisers wouldn't buy it.  He showed, the guy at the network showed it to advertisers that buy 10 p.m. time, which  is far more expensive than 10.30 time.  Fuck.  And they were like, we're not, what are you, what are you, what are you, you're insane? 
[01:10:30]  When's the second season hit?  It's going to be a while.  The guy fucks a hole in a wall and talks about Jesus.  Puts his penis in the hole.  Yeah, we're not.  That dentist scene that you did was, oh, wow.  Thanks.  That fucking, that was hysterical.  Gervais was.  The inferred mouth fuck.  Yeah.  I woke up from the dentist once and thought, I feel like he fucked my mouth.  Fucked my mouth.  I assumed it was based on something, Lou.  No, that whole thing is true.  It is, that dentist thing. 
[01:11:00]  I took nitrous and lots of drugs and I went, in my mind, to the desert, met Bin Laden and  talked him out of terrorism.  Talked him out of it.  I seriously had that experience so viscerally that when I came out of it and out of the  nitrous, I was like, that's the realest hallucination or dream I've ever had.  That really happened.  Yeah.  Damn.  Exactly.  The, uh, yeah, Ricky Gervais was great on it too.  Yeah, he's awesome.  Playing that fucking, and your reaction to him when he would just fuck with you. 
[01:11:30]  Stuck his finger in my ass.  Yeah, no, he's great.  And then you, he would get you again and you'd get mad at him.  Yes.  It's fucking brilliant.  That was a fun thing to do.  When's the second season going to hit?  It's a few more months, I'm sure.  June.  I started shooting in a couple of weeks.  Great.  I already shot the stand-up for it.  I did some stand-up, uh, I did a show in Atlanta and we shot the stand-up.  Oh, you're changing, uh, the venue.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm still, I also did the Comedy Cellar.  Right.  But I like the, I mean, I do more concerts now than I do.  Right.  That I did then. 
[01:12:00]  And so, I just wanted to use the house.  Yeah, right on.  So sometimes you'll see me in a concert and I'll probably also shoot at Caroline's again.  You're really famous.  Dude, you, Louie, something happened where, like, Louie's a famous guy, but something happened  in the last, it was before the show, it started, I think, with almost like the set on Conan  talking about flying.  Something just put you through the fucking roof, though.  It was like that next, that put you that one level higher where you are just mainstream  famous now.  It might be the Sarah Palin drunk tweets.  Yeah, those actually did a lot. 
[01:12:30]  Those did a lot.  Do you feel like you're...  And I took them down, but...  I know, but do you feel like you could still do that or you're a little worried about what  the people around you are going to say?  Well, it is true that nobody, I mean, the thing that happens with notoriety is that you,  at first, you get, you grow because more and more people like you, but then you get  pushed over this edge where people start becoming aware of you that don't know who you are  and that don't like you.  And take you out of context.  That's the dangerous thing about it is that, and because I'd love to have only exactly 
[01:13:00]  all the people that are like me, that like me, to know who I am.  That'd be a great world to live in.  And that nobody who doesn't have me as a taste is aware of me.  And actually, the internet, I think, lets people grow that way.  There's people...  Yeah.  This tour I did, we sold out every city easily with no advertising, which means you make more  money because you don't spend that money.  But I was in Philadelphia and I did this show in this huge theater there, I forget what it's  called.  And this guy I know came and he was like, I don't understand. 
[01:13:30]  He's a big money guy, like he makes, he invests and makes money.  He says, I live in Philly, I never heard of this show.  I never heard you're coming here.  Wow.  I don't understand how you sold out.  And that's because exactly the people that like me know who I am.  And nobody else knows.  And they know where you are and where you're going to be.  But as I'm pushing a little further, there's people that don't like my shit that know who  I am.  And that's when shit like saying Sarah Palin has people coming out of her cunt or whatever 
[01:14:00]  it was that I said.  It was rather salty.  People living in her cunt.  Yeah, it was a little unnecessary.  One of my favorite, one of my favorite things called for.  Yeah.  One of my favorite things is when I get a...  Barbaric attack.  When I get a tweet from someone going, oh boy, he's on a plane and he's drunk.  And I go right to your Twitter and I just follow along.  Well, I am definitely like a stereotypical Indian with the rum.  Something happens to me.  Something happens to me.  Don't you feel compelled?  With rum. 
[01:14:30]  Coke and rum.  I get riled up.  Yeah.  And I get a little crazy.  You feel compelled to just grab a drink the second you get on a plane.  Yeah, no.  I don't know what that is with me.  I'm like Bloody Mary guy.  Like the second I get on a plane, can I have a Bloody Mary?  And it's because I never really know or care what time it is.  And a Bloody Mary you could have for breakfast.  No, that's exactly right.  So if it's seven in the morning and I'm catching a flight or something, it's like, oh, Bloody Mary.  And then you just feel good.  You're clinking around your little drink and you're drinking.  And then you start tweeting. 
[01:15:00]  No, because there's something about alcohol and the mixture of oxygen on a plane.  Yeah, yeah.  It's deliberate.  It's not the atmosphere.  The oxygen you breathe on a plane is mixed by a person.  You know what I mean?  They decide how much.  Yeah, how much you need.  If they shut it off, you die.  I mean, that's how that golfers do.  It's helpful, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice to know.  So when you're drinking, the oxygen does it.  There's something about the mix that, I mean, every plane probably has a mandatory mix. 
[01:15:30]  I'm sure there isn't a knob that the person can go, eh, fuck these people.  Like, tweak it up or down.  I think it's factory set.  Let's go to 13% on these fucking assholes.  They get a little rambunctious.  Let's slow them down a bit.  Make them feel like they're on Mount Everest.  Yeah, so airplanes are the only place that most human beings share that your oxygen level is totally regulated.  Yeah.  Because in this room, I'm sure it's less than outside.  This is a great discussion to have with the Secret Service someday if the wrong tweet is sent out. 
[01:16:00]  No, you don't understand.  The oxygen was regulated.  Yes.  Combined with alcohol.  Exactly.  It was hammered.  I was reading those and I was like, oh, Lou.  Oh, Lou.  No, I...  You've got a lot to lose now.  It was funny to me the first time I did it.  It was funny to me that people got worried for me.  Like, I started sending them and I immediately got a response from somebody at FX.  A pretty high up executive at FX wrote and said, you got to take these down and apologize. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, this is within...  Holy shit.  This is the amazing thing about today.  I'm on an airplane.  And not only am I communicating with the ground, but I am broadcasting to 250,000 people instantly through Twitter.  And then getting instant angry feedback from...  And receiving it, right?  At 35,000 feet.  All of that is happening at 35,000 feet and then I'm...  You were talking to way more than 250,000.  Yeah, because everyone was retweeting it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, they're passing along to other people.  It was funny with the indignation.  I don't know this Louis C.K., but I don't like him.  Some of the comments are very funny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  No, the...  Some people got really angry.  And also some...  Oh, you will.  This show fucked me up with it.  This show got me in trouble.  Of course it did.  Because the tweets themselves, people just thought were just childish and pathetic, which they were.  Yeah.  But somebody hooked it up with a YouTube sound video of this show where I said stuff about her kid with Down Syndrome. 
[01:17:30]  They'll always rat out.  Yes.  The fans, you gotta realize, people, we're the worst fans.  Shut up.  Be cool.  You raised a brilliant point with that, though.  Show the fuck out sometime.  You said her age, the kid's age, is not Down Syndrome.  You won't notice the difference at that age because it's so young.  I thought that was a brilliant point.  Here's the thing about it.  Because I said...  I said...  Yeah, the point I was making was that she's saying that there's joys and challenges to having a Down Syndrome child.  She was saying this during the election.  Yeah.  And at the time, her baby was very, very young, like, you know, less than a month or something. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  Yeah, it was very young.  And so who cares if it's a Down Syndrome baby?  Now, of course, I was doing it on this show, and it's not a political show.  No.  So I also said, you know, who cares how many people came out of your retard-making cunt?  Oh, right.  I salted it up a little.  I made it a little spoonful of sugar is the way I was looking at it.  That was pepper on a substantial meal that you were serving.  Yes.  A little spice.  So, but anyway, all these, like, Breitbart and some big right-wing sites found that video 
[01:18:30]  and then hooked it up with the tweets and said he hates people with Down Syndrome.  That's why...  Why?  Of course I do.  That's why I went after her.  Because I just fucking hate those people.  But so, and then I felt, yeah, I felt like, I'm okay.  I've not said anything I'm ashamed.  But then I got this fucking email from this guy who said, I want to start by saying I hate  Sarah Palin.  She's a terrible person.  But what you said about children with Down Syndrome is extremely hurtful. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm like, first, I mean, I'm thinking, okay, I didn't say anything bad about people  with Down Syndrome.  Right.  So I'm nearly deleting the email.  And then there's a fucking picture of his daughter.  Oh, shit.  And he says, what you don't understand is that Down Syndrome isn't just something that depletes  a person's learning ability.  It's a really difficult thing to cope with in life.  And a baby with Down Syndrome needs surgery often right after birth and medication that 
[01:19:30]  you can't believe how expensive it is.  He says, her birth was such a difficult thing for our family.  It destroyed our family.  My wife and I broke up over the stress of it.  Wow.  And, uh, and, and, but I, my daughter's the greatest thing in my life.  And we, and we were all, you know, it's just pure joy, but it's so hard and it's extreme.  And he was so respectful that it was breaking my heart.  He never said, you filthy piece of shit.  He just said, you're so wrong. 
[01:20:00]  You wouldn't believe it.  But it's like, you're so way off.  You're spreading a thing that's really, really harmful.  And I felt like such a piece of shit.  But he was making it real and you're making it fun.  No, no, but I said, I said, though, the one thing I said that was wrong, I don't like  saying things that are just wrong.  I mean, cause it's not wrong that she has a retard making cunt.  Cause that's what one came out of there.  It's not a nice way of saying it.  It's not medical, but of course not. 
[01:20:30]  Your technical jargon.  Go ahead, Dr. Lou.  The thing that was wrong to say is that there's no challenges to having a downside.  I just didn't know that.  And you know, we always say reckless shit.  I don't care.  I don't fact check my comedy.  No.  And you shouldn't have to go.  You just let it out.  Yeah.  Exactly.  The only thing is that guy, he might've saved because what he, what he showed you was the  passion that people feel about that.  And it's like, they may have come at, like that may have been a very helpful email in 
[01:21:00]  the long run.  Like sometimes you underestimate how frustrated people are with something and then you hit  it and they come after you and it's fucking relentless.  The best thing would have been like five minutes later, get another email and go, I'm just  fucking with you with a picture of a beautiful daughter.  Just perfect.  Yeah.  She's amazing.  This is my daughter.  I'm just fucking with you.  I don't care.  I was laughing my balls off.  No.  And I've gotten angry emails before and I never care.  I don't, it's not my lookout.  Other people get it.  People choose what to get offended by, you know, people get offended by, you know, I had 
[01:21:30]  a funny moment at the comedy cellar.  I did this joke about nine 11.  Oh, I don't go for that.  Oh, you see, you see, I was doing a story about when I was married.  It was really about how being married, you're in trouble all the time.  You feel like you're in trouble when you're married.  Anthony constantly.  I don't get that sense from you.  You guys seem like you're okay.  We're all right, man.  Yeah.  I wish I had a story.  That's because you hit her, right?  Because if you hit her, it's not.  Sometimes you got it.  So it goes the other way.  What's better than when you go to scratch your eye and they flinch? 
[01:22:00]  But honestly, my old relationship, I can relate.  You walked around feeling like you're in trouble.  So yeah, you're hitting on something.  So yeah, so I was in LA and at six in the morning, my hotel room phone call, you know,  phone rang, my phone rang.  And my wife at the time was crying.  And I was like, what the fuck is this?  Did she find a phone sex bill?  She can't talk. 
[01:22:30]  I'm like, what is it?  And then she tells me, turn on the TV and it's both the World Trade Center towers are on fire.  And I was like, whoo-hoo!  That's the only person.  Oh, shit.  That's the only person.  Oh, damn.  To be deeply relieved.  That it wasn't something else.  That two planes were flown in the world.  That something wasn't.  It wasn't something else.  That America would never feel safe again.  That's a great show.  Anyway, I did it.  I told that story at the Comedy Cellar.  And this guy stood up and just stood up in that little room and said, that's not okay, man. 
[01:23:00]  It's not okay.  And he walked out.  So then I'm upstairs talking to Mark Maron, a comedian.  And I said, this guy told him the story.  And I said, you know, I hate people that pick the thing in the show.  That's what I'm offended by.  Because I said all kinds of shit in that show.  And he let it go.  But that's his sensitivity.  So I said, it's really narcissistic of people to decide what they're going to be offended by.  And Mark said, that's how insane it is that you're calling that guy a narcissist. 
[01:23:30]  When you're whole, that joke is the most narcissist thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  It's only important to you.  That you were pleased that thousands of people were dead because you weren't in trouble with your fucking wife.  Because you didn't know how to fucking face your wife.  Oh, shit.  That's really funny.  Once in a while, you get fucking shit.  Like, I did a 9-11 joke.  It was probably a year after, not even.  And I was doing something.  And it wasn't a knock on 9-11.  It was like somebody misinterpreting it.  But the woman in the audience.  It wasn't a knock on 9-11. 
[01:24:00]  I didn't mean to insult 9-11.  It was a brilliant program.  I mean, it's one of the most successful things I've ever seen.  But it was one of those things where I knew the person was misinterpreting the point of the joke.  And she was kind of like saying something.  And the woman behind her was looking at me.  And she was just shaking her head, no.  Like, don't.  Don't do this.  I started going after her.  And the woman behind her was like, ah.  And I backed off.  And then they told me after, like, yeah, her husband died.  And so I was really happy I backed off.  Because I was going to make it a whole big, like, thing like that. 
[01:24:30]  Like, you fucking cunt with the fuck.  You don't mind me talking about rape.  Right.  But once in a while, you back off.  And you're happy you did.  It's like, even though technically, all right.  She was being annoying.  Yeah.  Well, you're talking to a group of people.  And you could never be aware.  You can't make, you know, make people fill out a thing and then do a data report.  Right.  Well, that's why anybody that calls or however they get in touch with us and they say something  like, you know, I'm a big fan of the show.  I've been listening to it for years.  But when you said this, and it's like, you listened for years. 
[01:25:00]  You know how many fucking people we probably upset over the years that weren't you?  You fucking idiot.  No, exactly.  Yeah.  But, and also, some people get offended just because they, I'm sure there's 9-11 victims  who find that shit funny.  There has to be.  There has to be, right.  Like, a lot of times when we make fun of these things, we're just using them in a context.  You know, the thing I said is about the misery.  Marriage is so prohibitively constraining that a national disaster is good news to you. 
[01:25:30]  It's not so much making light of the disaster, it's showing how awful marriage is.  It's also brutally honest.  A lot of people have felt relief at something that wasn't affecting them that was worse for  other people.  Well, you were just being fucking ugly and naked and honest about it.  That's the beauty of it.  No, and look, this is the most fucked up thing to say, but if you, if you suffered a direct...  That you could have stopped the attacks and didn't you?  I could have, but I wanted the bit.  I had inside information. 
[01:26:00]  But I thought, God, that bit is so funny, I'm going to let it go.  If you suffer directly or indirectly from something, you don't own it.  You just don't.  No, no, you don't.  You're right.  Unless your name is 9-11.  We have, all of us in here, have goofed on things that have directly affected our lives.  Yeah, sure.  Personally affected our lives.  Of course.  And some of the things people know about, some they don't, whatever.  It's not yours. 
[01:26:30]  And you just do it.  It's not yours.  It's not fucking, it's whatever it is.  You put it over the air to make people laugh or think or whatever the fuck we're doing  in here.  But it's not, you know, I'm not singling out all the people that this will offend.  Hey, let me offend some people today with this.  No, I'm going for the people that it doesn't offend.  No, and again, if you took part in something or something, you suffered from something that  doesn't give you the right to, if it's a thing that happened in the world, especially  something that happened to the whole country, you don't get to control who gets to say what  about it. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  And by the way, you get to get offended about it.  That's my main thing about people getting offended.  Yeah, you got offended.  So that gets to happen.  There's been this.  That's part of living on the earth.  That's okay.  There's been this whole thing that's taken place over the past few years where people absolutely  believe that there is a right to not be offended.  To not hear something that offends you.  And especially if it's over airwaves and stuff like that.  They think that the FCC, they can complain to the FCC and say they were offended by something 
[01:27:30]  and absolutely think that the FCC will go, hey, fuck you.  Well, you know, I subscribe to the thought that laughter really is the best medicine.  Straight talking, Jim.  That's right.  I don't want to get too serious, guys.  Well, I remember I got an email once because of the Catholic Church video that I have on  YouTube where I go to the church and find out that they completely exist to fuck boys  in the ass.  Hilarious, by the way.  That is fucking hysterical. 
[01:28:00]  And I've gotten a number of emails about that.  And less than I thought I would.  Wow.  But it's funny that most people that complain about it, they'll say, you know, Jesus is  Lord and you've offended him and I'm going to crack your fucking head open, you motherfucker.  Yeah.  Like, I get that all the time.  Which is really an odd little...  People say, from a Christian point of view, you've hurt Jesus.  Yeah.  And I'm going to fucking split your head open, you cunt.  Like, they're so profane and so threatening. 
[01:28:30]  That forgiveness shit goes out the window when it comes to religion.  But anyway, one guy wrote to me and said, my uncle is a Catholic priest and you insulted  him.  And I wrote him back and I said, no, I don't know your uncle.  Yeah, it's not like I fucking insult him.  No, I made a broad joke about a whole group and it's got nothing to do with your uncle.  And he wrote back and said, I know, but...  And then we wrote back and forth and we figured it out.  Are you too fagged out? 
[01:29:00]  What happened?  I don't like the end of that story.  I got to interrupt because we got Ron Perlman outside the studio.  He's out at 8.15.  He only has a few minutes, so we should get him in as well.  By the way, as Ron makes his way into the studio, Louis C.K. Hilarious will make its network  television premiere this Sunday night at 10 on Comedy Central.  Yes.  Hearing great things about Hilarious.  I've seen it.  What's up, Ron?  It is Hilarious.  And it's going to be on CD and DVD Tuesday, January 11th, Louis C.K.  But first, we got Ron Perlman in the studio.  Hey, how you doing?  How are you?  Nice to meet you. 
[01:29:30]  Thank you.  Ron Perlman, huge fan of Louis C.K.  We're on the same network, this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  The FX.  I know.  Unbelievable with Sons of Anarchy.  That show is so good.  I don't fucking know.  Sons of Anarchy.  We're in the same place.  Sons of Anarchy.  They're very liberal-minded, those guys.  Yes.  That's stupid.  That's crazy.  What's up, Ron?  How you doing, everybody?  Yeah, man.  Welcome to the show.  Been watching Ron for years.  Good to see you.  Absolutely.  One of my favorites.  I've got to just bring it up real quick.  Alien.  What was it? 
[01:30:00]  Resurrection.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was good.  That was one of the franchises I managed to close down.  I went through a spate of that.  I closed down a lot of venerable, venerable old institutions.  Star Trek.  They never made another one of those.  That was done.  They had to reboot the whole thing.  What I'm proudest about, and this is probably more public service than anything else, was  I closed down the police academy franchise.  Oh, thank you for doing that.  Wow.  You're on the last one of those?  Yeah.  You should get a trophy for that.  Wow.  Definitely the last one of those. 
[01:30:30]  I take personal credit for it, too.  But look at what you're doing with Hellboy.  People love Hellboy.  I closed that one, too?  You closed that one, too.  I liked it.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  You were in the island of Dr. Moreau.  How nuts was Brando to be around?  Brando was actually, he was like the rock compared to some of the shit that was on that  set.  That's one of the weirdest movies I ever saw.  That was like, you know, After Heaven's Gate, the biggest clusterfuck in the movie history. 
[01:31:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Did him and Val Kilmer not like each other?  There was something between him and Val Kilmer?  I really can't comment.  One of them is still alive.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that movie was crazy.  Yeah.  That movie just started feeling like you were just hanging around that island after a while.  It actually felt like you were there?  You should have been there.  It was.  I mean, they actually hired me.  I was really in essentially one scene and then a couple of little pops, you know. 
[01:31:30]  And I was, my deal was for three weeks.  I ended up being there for four and a half months.  Oh, my God.  And, you know, at one point I just turned to the director and said, what the fuck is going  on?  And he goes, wow.  And it was the great John Frankenheimer on his last assignments.  The great late John Frankenheimer.  But he was like an old school dude, you know, just completely, like, not part of the 21st 
[01:32:00]  century at all.  And, although this was the early 90s, so he was entitled.  He says, well, Marlon says, give it to the guy from Quest for Fire.  I said, give what to the guy?  He says, every one of Val's lines.  Just give it to him.  The guy from Quest.  That guy can act.  So I said, so I'm, you know, I may be here for the rest of my born days, right? 
[01:32:30]  He goes, possibly, possibly, Ron.  Oh, my God.  You're in Season of the Witch.  That's true.  Is the new movie that's coming out.  Nicolas Cage.  Right.  Nicolas Cage.  What a movie machine he is.  Jesus Christ.  He makes a lot of films.  He does make a lot of God damn films.  That guy's got to be pulling in three, four hundred grand a year.  I'll perhaps put an edge.  He seems.  You think that much?  He's, he's, I think he's working on three right now. 
[01:33:00]  Jesus.  What the fuck?  He's going to start doing them live after a while.  No, that's me.  I'll come to your house if you can't go.  I'll do the whole fucker.  I play all the parts.  When is that opening up?  It opens Friday.  Friday?  Friday the 7th, yeah.  And who are you, who are you in that?  I'm his, his buddy.  Oh, really?  Is this a stretch?  It's a buddy film.  It's, it's a lot, it's a lot of things.  It's, uh, uh, but, but essentially, um, you know, what was most attractive to me was 
[01:33:30]  that, you know, he and I are these, these two, uh, warriors, uh, warrior knights in  the Crusades.  And we've been fighting kind of shoulder to shoulder for like a dozen and a half years.  And, um, you know, um, so it's, it's, it's on that level, it's a buddy movie.  And then, then it's kind of like Bing Crosby and Bob Hope road picture.  We are all things to all people. 
[01:34:00]  And then there's a little witchcraft, a little this, a little that, you know, a little song  and dance.  When, when you got into, uh, acting, did you think, uh, cause you have become kind of  this action, uh, action star guy.  Uh, at 60, I turned.  Or that's sick, just when I can't do anything about it, they actually want me to run up  hills.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah.  Cause I've noticed over the years, like at first, uh, early on, you weren't really cast  in, uh, in, in, uh, the action roles. 
[01:34:30]  And now, you know, a little later in your career, I guess, uh, well, everyone else has  died off.  Is, is, is what's happened.  So they're giving you the parts.  Yeah.  If you hang out long enough, you're the only one that's left on that list, you know?  And, and you were on, you were like one of the most well-known unrecognized people on,  uh, beauty and the beast years ago, uh, when you're on that TV series.  Uh, how was that?  That must've been, was it frustrating for you?  Uh, no, actually just the opposite.  You know, I mean, I, I, I, you know, you see guys, guys like Nick Cage really have to 
[01:35:00]  give thought to their every movement.  You know, they just, you know, and I'm like.  I'm at the, you know, the Gelson's in LA at, you know, like, you know, two o'clock in  the afternoon and no one cares.  I mean, you know, I, I, I can go anywhere.  I can just to, to this day and, and do anything.  I have never, never had to make an alteration to my, you know, sordid lifestyle.  You're pretty recognizable though.  Well, yeah, I think the FX show, you know, this, which is the center of Louis, Louis on, 
[01:35:30]  uh, has, has, uh, uh, magnified the profile.  But, you know, um, I mean, I was able to, to basically move through life, uh, you know,  unfettered, uh, cause just nobody gave a shit.  Fucking honesty.  I love it.  Holy shit.  Hey, we got a little too early in the morning.  It's a lot more of that.  Let's say hi to Bill in, uh, Boston.  Bill, Bill. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, I just want to let you know that I love your work on Sons of Anarchy and I really like  the mutant chronicles.  I really enjoyed that movie.  Thanks for all your work.  Oh, it's my pleasure, my friend.  My pleasure.  All right.  I'm looking at you.  Do you have a question or you just want to kiss his ass?  I guess that's it.  No question.  All right.  No question.  Have a nice day, Bill.  He just loves Sons of Anarchy and everything.  And the mutant chronicles.  And, uh, and of course, yeah.  Yeah.  Who will ever forget?  What do you, I guess a lot of people.  Bill didn't.  Bill didn't forget. 
[01:36:30]  God bless you.  What do you, uh, what do you like watching?  What kind of shows you enjoy?  Um, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a kind of a, I've turned into a political junkie a little  bit, but I get all my news through MSNBC because I'm like a, you know, I'm a lifelong, you  know, lower middle class Jew lefty from upper Manhattan, you know?  So, you know, I like having my news filtered through, you know, a blue lens through the  liberal, uh, I'm a Chris, I'm a Chris Matthews freak, uh, watch that show, TiVo, that show 
[01:37:00]  every day.  And, you know, when, when, uh, when I'm on my own time, it's just turning classic movies  pretty much.  Yeah.  That's my, that's my, like my, that's my, like my, that's  my, uh, my, uh, antidote to a cold, hard, really cruel world is to go back and watch  old black and white movies and go, oh, oh, Humphrey, oh, Carrie, oh, Bert, you know, that's  it, man.  I mean, you know, it's just a, another time and place, you know, it seems like, uh, it 
[01:37:30]  was, it seems like it was, uh, there was a little order of the universe back then.  A little English people with high collars arguing very politely with their little pinky  out.  I was watching one of those movies and it was these English, uh, English guy in trial  for murder.  And the lawyer's supposed to be a brilliant, uh, you know, arguer or whatever, debater.  You're better than me. 
[01:38:00]  And he's like, I put it to you that you murdered her.  And the guy says, I put it to you that I didn't.  I put it to you that you did.  And everyone's like, ooh.  A lot of people are putting it to a lot of other motherfuckers.  Got some people booing that you said MSNBC there, Ron.  Oh, really?  Ah, fuck them.  Well, politics will absolutely divide everybody and get them going for the throat.  Yeah, but it's like a sports team now.  Right.  Yeah, it really is.  Fox News versus MSNBC.  That's all it is.  You're right. 
[01:38:30]  Fuck the Red Sox.  You know.  Yeah.  Yankees, Red Sox.  Start buying your MSNBC jersey now.  Yeah, because ask that guy, why don't you like it?  Well, because just liberal.  What is it about liberals you don't like?  Just because bashing Bush.  And he's not even president anymore.  Yeah, but liberal.  It's just the same.  And it's the same on the other side.  Why don't you like Fox News?  Just because just conservative. 
[01:39:00]  All of a sudden, it's just like, yeah, you just went gay when he talked about it.  No, no, no, it's California.  It's not gay.  I slip into that all the time myself.  I do, too.  Are you involved politically at all in anything?  Just in my living room.  Just in your living room?  Your armchair kind of?  Yeah, I yell and scream.  I mean, I'm very, very politically involved in my car.  Yeah, oh, okay.  So you could yell and scream.  Do you check in on what the other side's talking about and doing?  Absolutely not.  Get yourself annoyed? 
[01:39:30]  Absolutely not.  No?  Really?  No.  I just don't.  I don't give a fuck.  It's all poppycock to me.  Like, what do you think?  Does it affect you in any way?  Do you really think it affects you in any way personally?  Who's in charge?  Like, now, today, as a matter of fact, you know, the Republican House is going to be sworn in.  Do you think that is going to affect you in any way, shape, or form?  Yeah, they're not swearing in anybody else because it's just the Republican House.  Just the Republican House. 
[01:40:00]  Do I think?  I actually do.  I really do.  I really do think that government plays a role in people's everyday lives.  You know, you look at things that are historic landmark sweeping legislative victories, you know, like the Civil Rights Act and Medicare and Medicaid and all that stuff. 
[01:40:30]  And, you know, even the abolishment of slavery, which were, you know, things that really affected the whole sort of, not just spiritual.  Affected the South.  But, you know, it always came with these horrific, bloody, bloody fights.  And there are still people today that are railing against FDR, you know, for, you know, fucking socialist, cocksucker. 
[01:41:00]  Well-fair state.  You know, and, you know, I mean...  Hey, that's just, sorry to interrupt you, but slavery, emancipation, was that a piece of legislation or was it an executive...  How did he...  It never occurred to me.  How did he do it?  It ended up to be an amendment to the Constitution.  It was an amendment to the Constitution.  Because the original Constitution allowed for slavery and in order to, I mean, you know, the Civil War was the execution of, you know, the unearthing of the illegality to secede from the Union, number one. 
[01:41:30]  And number two, then, you know, they needed to add an amendment to correct the...  So how do you, when you put an amendment, Congress has to do that, right?  Congress has to do that.  But it has to be a huge lopsided vote or something.  Some guy just sneaks into the middle of the night and writes it and goes, no, that was here.  You didn't see this?  In fact, John Boehner was still, was in office back then.  Good old Boehner. 
[01:42:00]  Well, politics are very polarizing.  How many times have I said that, Lou?  Hundreds.  It really is, though.  But I know some actors really get on board.  You know, like Sean Penn is going down there and meeting with Chavez.  And, you know, he's always going over the Middle East.  He's consistent.  I don't agree with him, but I'll say this.  He's a very consistent guy.  He is consistent.  And he's a fucking amazing actor.  So it's like, I love his work.  He's a guy who I find annoying, but I love him so much. 
[01:42:30]  His work is so good.  It's like you can't not like the guy.  Yeah, because some guys, some actors that are into politics, it seems like they're just trying to find more lists that they can get on.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not really about the cost.  It's like, I got people.  Like when I hear that the White House briefed Barbra Streisand, I'm like, don't fucking waste all these people's time.  You're doing that.  That's why I like it.  She just wants to know that she can jet into D.C.  That's why I like Ron just does it from his living room.  You know, I think that there are people who spend their lives professionally doing that, and I have a different life choice professionally. 
[01:43:00]  And it's not, you know, I also think that it's not necessarily helpful when entertainers get involved in things that they shouldn't.  You know, you see some of these, like, guys that appear before Congress to testify about, you know, their pet peeve.  That kind of rubs me the wrong way.  I don't think that helps.  I think the best thing I can do for somebody I support is stay as far the fuck away from me. 
[01:43:30]  Because, you know, what happens if, you know, they don't like, you know, a movie I did?  Yeah.  That guy's going to lose votes.  That's an awful way for a cause to get shot down.  Yeah, exactly.  Because Police Academy 8 stunk so bad.  Yeah, fuck the unborn.  That movie stunk.  That's right.  You know, so I just quietly, you know.  Do you, well, I mean, there's a reason I have a lead by example bumper sticker on.  That's the way I feel.  Jimmy's disgusting me today. 
[01:44:00]  Do you, are you getting a lot of bikers getting in touch with you and stuff?  Are there some frightening people that you've met because of Sons of Anarchy?  Oh, my God, yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they're frightening, but they're showing us a huge amount of love.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  Are there any that don't like you?  Are there any that feel like that's not the way we are, man?  No one has emerged so far that doesn't like, I'm sure there are people sticking, you know,  pins and dolls, you know, Ron Perlman dolls, Hellboy dolls. 
[01:44:30]  Yes, you know, but no, I've actually, you know, we only work five months a year, which  is the beauty of working on FX.  You only do 13 episodes, so you have a lot of time to do other stuff.  And between the second and third season, I was like all over the United States doing  various other projects.  And every time it became known that I showed up in, like, Albuquerque or, you know, Illinois,  something like that, I would get a message, you know, that the guys want to sit down, you 
[01:45:00]  know, and have a little sit down.  And I go, yeah, you know, let me give you a call.  So I've yet to take advantage of it, but, you know, that's when, you know, you realize  how insignificant what the New York Times has to say about your work is, but, you know,  when the bikers actually endorse you and say, you know, you know, we're not that thrilled 
[01:45:30]  that there's, you know, because, you know, they're outlaws essentially at the end of the  day, and they'd rather stay off the grid and off the radar, but they have shown us a huge  amount of support for the, how nuanced the show is, how ungratuitous the show tries to  stay and how, you know.  That you don't stereotype it and just paint a typical picture.  Yeah, you know, because pretty much every time you've seen anything with bikers, except  for, like, Easy Rider, which was, like, not really a biker thing, it was just two guys 
[01:46:00]  on bikes, but it's pretty, it's usually pretty superficial.  It's usually just like, you know, they use the world, you know, for ends that don't really  service the world or that stereotype the world.  Ride into a town, wait, pillage, leave.  Yeah, do you remember Joe Namath made a biker movie?  Oh, damn.  C.C.  C.C.  C.C.  Rider.  He made the biker movie.  And they show him walking through a supermarket and, like, grabbing a milk carton and drinking  it and then throwing it on the floor and just, like, pushing people around a little bit. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, he was crazy in that.  Crazy biker guy.  God.  Joe Namath.  This show is so good, though.  Have you watched it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's so good.  And I don't keep up with anything regularly.  I can't keep, you know, I just don't have time and I've got kids and stuff, but I'm very  busy, man.  Every time it comes on, every time I see it, I think I can't, because dramas, a lot of  dramas are too intense and too involved.  And you'll see guys talking and the scene's like this low talking. 
[01:47:00]  Cyrus wants to meet on Tuesday, but do we have the chips to, you know, leverage him?  And I'm like, what the fuck are you people talking about?  But when I watch that show, I watch for two more minutes and then I'm like, wow, they  got to get Cyrus to meet.  What's going to happen to him?  I hope Cyrus doesn't decide to be a no-show.  Yeah.  Do you ride?  I don't ride well.  I'm not that guy.  You know, it's funny because there's the whole rest of the cast that just loves the bikes. 
[01:47:30]  And then there's me.  That's just, you know, an actor playing a part.  But you have to ride in certain scenes.  You have to ride.  Are you like, let me go straight and then could you get someone in here to make the  turn for me?  Well, they hired me to do this part while I was doing a movie in Romania.  So I literally, for the pilot, which segued right into the first season of filming, I  got off a plane on Sunday night and on a Harley Monday morning. 
[01:48:00]  I'd never been on a bike before in my life.  And those are heavy bikes to start on.  Yeah.  My bike is just shy of a thousand pounds.  Did you regret riding motorcycles under special skills in your resume?  Yeah, I did.  That and horseback riding.  I pretty much lied about whatever you can think of.  Juggling, French.  The only thing I really never lied about was the knitting.  It's hard to fit that into the show.  I've never done a movie about knitting.  I took so much time out of my youth to learn how to purl and whatever. 
[01:48:30]  Anyway, so the first season, you know, you'd see me pulling out in a really dramatic fashion.  And then you'd see me pulling in.  And the rest of it was, you know, the back of some stunt guy's head.  Some stunt guy, yeah.  Then in the hiatus for the second season, I actually spent some time on a bike, you know,  tried to find a little bit of a comfort zone, which I'm still terrified of that particular, you know. 
[01:49:00]  It's, yeah, it's scary.  I'm terrified.  I like a little metal around me when I'm driving on the road.  I pulled this machine, pulling you by the arms.  I mean, I don't even like going.  I'm fucking nasty.  Pulling you by the arms.  Yeah, that's what it feels like.  I used to have one.  And I rode a motorcycle for like two years in New York City.  And I was never totally unscared.  I was always, I was, I wanted really badly to get in an accident that wouldn't hurt me. 
[01:49:30]  Like that was my fantasy.  And it's exactly what happened to me.  I cracked the bike up really badly and then, and I was fine.  You can't.  So I could say, oh, I don't.  I'm dumb.  I could just stop.  You can't be on alert that long.  No.  Every day.  You can't scratch your nose.  You can't have like this.  You know, sometimes when you're driving your car, you could just kind of drift off a little  as long as your peripherals are working.  On a bike, it's just like constant fucking honest state of alert.  I was in a helicopter once going to do it and doing a show in Western Pennsylvania.  And the guy, he's just holding up the joystick with both hands. 
[01:50:00]  And he says, I'm just chatting with him about how it works.  And he goes, well, if I, uh, if I have a muscle twitch and let go, we just drop out  of the sky.  Oh, great.  We would just fall.  Thanks for letting me know that.  Oh, you should have said to him, hey, thanks for sharing.  Yeah.  That's what I should have said.  Many, many, many years ago.  Many years ago, I was going to do a film about the, you know, like these Long Island bikers.  And so I needed to learn how to ride.  I was still living here in New York at the time. 
[01:50:30]  So I took this like a safety course, which you have, you're required to take first to  learn how to ride the bike.  But then you got to spend all this classroom time because you got to take the written test  because you got to get the license, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  So we walk into the classroom experience and the, you know, the first thing the guy, the  instructor says is, uh, who here can say what the percentage of people who ride a bike,  uh, get into a crash.  So, uh, one guy says 20%.  He says, a little higher.  And this goes on and on and on. 
[01:51:00]  Finally, he says, nobody, nobody, a hundred percent.  Really?  He wasn't jiving, man.  I mean, if you ride a bike, you are going to crash.  At some point in your bike riding career, you'll crash.  And you could be phenomenal at it, but other drivers are not looking for bikes.  You know, people are like changing lanes like crazy.  The classic is the left turn in front of people.  People will just, they, I drive a fucking Escalade and people turn left in front of me.  Like, what are you doing?  They can't see you. 
[01:51:30]  This thing is battling down.  No, and on a motorcycle, you're only on two wheels.  So if you have a slight hitch in the flow of your driving, you fall down.  Do you fall in a car if you have like, oh, whoops.  Then you just sort of, yeah.  But there's nothing, there's nothing more challenging than riding a Harley and trying  to text, text, text message back to your manager.  Have you tried doing that?  I'm running late, you know.  Ah!  I had a moped accident when I was 15.  I did. 
[01:52:00]  Wow, really fitting in.  I don't want anybody to be alarmed.  But I mean, I had one when I was 15, and I flipped off the top, and I said, I'll never  be on a motorcycle.  It just scared me.  You never were on a motorcycle.  I was on a motorcycle.  That's what I'm saying.  I would never do it after that.  It scares me.  Are you okay?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I'm fine.  Sometimes I still wake up screaming.  Was the motor running, or were you in pedal mode?  Literal fucking asshole.  I almost answered you.  No, the motor was running.  All kidding aside.  I shouldn't joke about this.  I really am a jizz bag.  It's not a motorized vehicle that you can also pedal.  We got Rod Perlman in studio. 
[01:52:30]  We got to let him go in a few minutes.  But John in Jersey has a great question.  John.  Hey, Ron.  Just want to say love The Sons of Anarchy and all your work in some of the other movies.  My question is, honestly, how big are Katie Seagal's cans?  Are they really as big as they look?  That's a great question.  You know, I never looked.  Never?  Never?  I never looked.  I never looked.  It's just about the eyes.  Of course.  It's all about eye to eye. 
[01:53:00]  What do you think, John?  Yeah, what do you think, John?  Extremely large.  I'm just wondering if I could get a size or something like that.  He needs it for a spectacle.  Probably best for you to go to katiesagal.com.  Yeah.  And I think there's a little column on the left which says measurements.  You have to log in.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I'm trying to save my job here.  It's a funny thing. 
[01:53:30]  It's such a dumb thing to ask.  It really is a great question.  That girl looks like she's got big tits.  I got a question.  Does she have big tits?  Does she?  I know.  I mean, I see her and her tits are really big.  Sorry, are they big?  I just want to know if her tits are big.  I will say this, John.  There's no CGI on the show.  No.  It's all digital video.  We've got to get Ron out of here because he's doing TV.  Where are you going next, Ron?  It's all over the place. 
[01:54:00]  WPIX.  Oh, look at you.  The original home of the New York Yankees.  That's right.  When the scooter used to do the games before leaving in the third inning.  Holy cow.  You New Yorkers.  Yeah, you know, I talk scooter.  Whoever's going to listen.  Scooter would leave, though.  Say hi to Jill Nicolini over there for him.  Thank you.  I sure will.  But, yeah, I mean, I go back to when Red Barber was doing Yankee games.  I don't remember Red Barber.  Red Barber here.  It was Frank Messer, Bill White, and the scooter.  Yeah, no, well, that's like, for me, like third generation. 
[01:54:30]  It was originally, the scooter was just segwaying into being an announcer.  He had just stopped being the shortstop when I started watching the games.  Pre-money store.  Yeah, in fact, they hadn't invented cleats yet when I started watching Yankee games.  That's not true.  But anyway, yeah.  Isn't that distressing that we all went, really?  Yeah.  Really?  Runs.  It was Mel Allen, which, you know, they'll never be the better voice of the Yankees.  Mel Allen.  This week in baseball is where I know him from. 
[01:55:00]  I didn't know him as a Yankee announcer.  Yeah.  He was the Yankee announcer through my entire...  Because I started watching games during the real heyday of the franchise, which was in the 50s, which is the entire career of Mantle.  Most of Yogi Berra, you know, Whitey Ford.  How fucking old are you?  You're not that old.  You're in really good shape.  Yeah.  For what you remember.  Yeah.  Those memories usually fit inside of a really disgusting bag of shit.  I know. 
[01:55:30]  What a bunch of queers we are.  Really?  You saw Scooter play?  You have a great body for that.  No, I mean, my dad walked me into a Yankee game, my first game, in, like, 1952.  So, I don't...  Jesus.  I think that's why you got your action films later in life.  Because once you've gone...  Now that you've gone gray and your whiskers look hard beaten, it's more interesting to see you, like, you know, chomping a cigar and fucking with somebody.  Like, looking... 
[01:56:00]  You know what I mean?  You want to see a guy that looks like this.  It's got...  The copper in his blood has started showing in his hair a little bit, you know.  It's like he's got a...  It's more interesting.  He's got the look where he has the experience of fucking people up for a lot of years.  Yeah, exactly.  That's somebody you want to watch.  That's a compliment.  That's a compliment, right?  I don't want to watch fucking, you know...  Whenever Leonardo DiCaprio balls up his little fucking boy fists and punches somebody, you see the guy, like, reel back, like, oh!  And you're like, nah, he didn't hit you that hard.  But if Ron Perlman fucks... 
[01:56:30]  You know, he's one of those guys who you could actually believe that he could just turn your head and kill you, that thing.  Yeah, yeah, that snap.  Yeah.  I want to see a fist that's been holding cock since the 50s punch somebody.  That actually didn't start until 61.  After Mantle had already...  Yeah.  Once Mantle was gone, it was just me and my cock.  Oh, fuck.  We've got to get Ron out of here, unfortunately.  Season of the Witch, it's in theaters this Friday.  With Nick Cage. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  And FX, Sons of Anarchy.  Great show.  It's a great show, absolutely.  And, of course, all our other wonderful Ron Perlman gems that we love so much.  Thank you so much.  Like he says, he ruined the franchise.  But I love that goddamn alien resurrection.  And I think, you know, at that point the franchise was done anyway.  I don't think you had anything to do with it.  You played a badass in that.  I liked that.  That was a good one.  Thank you, man.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, Ron.  I've been here, guys.  All right.  Ron Perlman, everyone.  All right.  Fucking laughing our balls off.  A little taste of Louis C.K. doing Hilarious, which is going to be on TV Sunday night at 
[01:57:30]  10 p.m. on Comedy Central.  And then on Tuesday, you can get the CD and or DVD.  Hilarious.  And we got Louis C.K. in studio today.  Fucking laughing hard at that show.  Thank you.  So fucking funny, man.  Thank you.  Damn it.  Well, that was two specials ago now.  Yeah.  All right.  Stop bragging.  I mean that it's old.  It's old in his mind, but that shit is as current as anything. 
[01:58:00]  We took this as a movie.  This is the one we took to Sundance as a movie.  Oh, really?  It was the first stand-up performance film that showed at Sundance.  Wow.  And it did really well there.  It was fun.  That saloon shit is just great.  The vagary of the old west.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Goddamn, Louis.  I hate funny people.  How's the personal life?  How's the daughters?  Everything good there?  They're great.  My kids are great. 
[01:58:30]  My daughters, the oldest one is in third grade, and the other one's in kindergarten.  They go to the same school now, which is a massive savings of time.  Oh, yeah.  They used to walk them to two different schools.  Pick them up at two different schools.  Now it's a one-stop drop.  Are you going to reflect that in your TV show?  How accurate is the daughters and you on the show?  Are they going to grow up on the show, or are they going to have to replace them?  Are you going to age them rapidly like a soap opera? 
[01:59:00]  Well, the girls on my show are totally different than the girls, my kids.  Yeah.  They're only represented in age.  But my kids are nothing like those girls.  They're really fictional.  I mean, most of them are my family.  I never thought that they were an accurate depiction of your kids, even though I don't  know your kids.  But the way you're reacting to them, that seems to be like you.  No, that is definitely different, too.  That's different, too.  Do you beat your children? 
[01:59:30]  No, no, no.  You're not showing on the show?  My daughters and I have a very real and close relationship, a very warm relationship, and  we're just great friends.  They're my favorite people, my daughters, and we get along great.  And I used to get frustrated when I was younger at just getting through a day with kids.  With no fun from your act.  We would never have known that.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, and I definitely distilled and purified that frustration for the sake of entertainment.  I've had, all through being a dad, incredible moments and times in my life that are completely 
[02:00:00]  unfunny, so those are kept out of there.  No one wants to see that.  No one ever will.  No way to make it funny.  No way.  Just not.  Like, I did a bit during this last tour I did about sleeping, and my daughters wake  me up in the morning, like at 6 o'clock every morning.  And I don't need to get up to like 7, 7.30 to get them to school, but they get me up  at 6, because they're awake and they want to share the day with me, you know? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  So I did this bit about how good sleep feels at 6 a.m., like how much I don't want to  wake up, because I feel like I'm, you know, fathoms deep in a river of chocolate, and  there's a, sleep is like an ancient whore who's sucking me off slowly and speaking in  a dead language.  You know, this whole thing I do about how badly, how much I don't want to wake up, then  I wake up and I'm miserable.  When I conceived that bit, the second part to it was the truth, which is as badly, as 
[02:01:00]  much as I hate getting upright at 6 a.m., once I'm feeding my kids breakfast and we're  chatting, I'm so happy to get up.  Yeah.  Because when I'm on the road, or when my kids aren't with me, I always sleep till like  noon or 1 o'clock, and I wake up, I feel like a piece of shit, and most of the day is  gone.  But I get up at 6 o'clock, and even though the transition is difficult, standing there and  feeding them, I feed them a full breakfast every morning.  I make them bacon and eggs and stuff, and I stand there watching them eat it, and we 
[02:01:30]  chat, and it's such a great, it's such a real life to me.  That's real.  But when I do, so when I started it on stage, I'd tell the part about sleeping and about  not wanting to wake up, and then I'd get to that part, and the laughter would just completely  stop.  Oh, shit.  I had no way to make that funny.  It's not funny.  So I stopped doing it.  Oh, you're a good dad.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  So I just dropped that part off.  Then where does the Louis from the TV show...  Well, that guy, I mean, I definitely, I like the show to be, just to make mistakes I never 
[02:02:00]  would, and to be more reactive and have less control over myself.  It's just funnier.  It's, you're in a weird situation with this, and I think it's a good person to compare it  to.  It was Seinfeld, I think, went through the same thing.  A lot of people assume that's Seinfeld because he's Jerry Seinfeld on the show, that that's  Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah.  And that is not Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah, no, he's not like that. 
[02:02:30]  On the show.  No.  So when you watch your show, you're Louis, you're a stand-up, you're doing what you do.  Yeah.  So a lot of people assume that's an accurate depiction of you head to toe.  That's you.  Yeah, no, I definitely am different than that guy on the show.  And where does that come from?  Like, just, you make, you make up a guy and kind of...  I mean, it's me, but I don't do the things I would do, usually.  Some of it is playing out fantasies, like saying things out loud to people that are bothering  me that I never would say out loud.  My dumb questions are just, I'm amazed at people's creativity. 
[02:03:00]  I can't fathom being able to make shit up like that.  You're like a little boy, though.  But are the cameras really there, or are the youth reading them?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  But the...  I am an ass.  The kids on the show are...  Actually, two different girls played my youngest daughter last season.  Dick Sargent and Dick York.  That's right.  I almost fucked that up.  And it wasn't far from that.  They were very close.  We had a girl playing... 
[02:03:30]  When I started doing the show, FX wanted to make my talent deals for me, because they  have these packages they give actors, you know.  And I said, I don't want to do that, because I don't want you to know who I'm hiring.  Keep everything on the queue.  I want to do it myself, you know.  Our little company hires our actors directly.  And also, I don't want to give people series deals, because I don't want to be forced to  put them on the show.  Yeah.  I don't like having to say, oh, what are we going to have to make up for this guy this  time?  So, the girls, you know, I hired two actresses to play my daughters, and the guy who runs 
[02:04:00]  FX said to me, yeah, but what if one of them gets another job?  And I said, well, fuck her then.  I'll get another one.  I don't care.  No one cares.  No one gives a shit.  It doesn't matter who's playing them.  It really doesn't.  You're fucking brilliant.  No, so one of the girls, the girl who played my youngest daughter, she got a pilot on ABC.  It wasn't even a show that went to, I knew it wouldn't go to the series, because no pilots  really ever do.  But I said, let her go.  We'll get another one.  And then if she comes back next year, you know.  So, she left, and then we got another one and started using her, and then the thing 
[02:04:30]  came up.  Well, this is what FX warned me of.  Do I tell them that I replaced my daughter?  And I decided, no, I'll just, because they don't see the show until it's complete.  They don't see, read scripts, they don't see footage.  Oh, shit, okay.  So, I figured they'll see an episode with the new kid, and then I'll get a phone call,  and I'll deal with it then.  They'll assume they've lost the part.  Yeah, so I put it on, I sent it to them, the first episode with the new girl.  They didn't say anything.  They didn't notice?  They never noticed.  And then the last, one of the last episodes, actually, both girls, because I used, I matched 
[02:05:00]  two stories that weren't originally supposed to be.  One girl plays my daughter in the first half of the episode, and another girl plays her  in the second half, and no one noticed.  No one said anything, and I finally talked to the FX guy, and I said, did you know that  I've got two girls?  And he was like, no.  And nobody, none of these fucking commenty, complainy cunts on the internet have ever  picked up on it.  Nobody, because who gives a shit?  It doesn't matter. 
[02:05:30]  Do you know how hard it is to get creative control like that?  Like, that's like a fucking Kubrick or Spielberg type of thing.  Nobody has 100%.  That's amazing.  Well, and it's from being on the other side of the spectrum from those guys that we drove  the show down to be so cheap that it's not like Spielberg owns the world so he can do  what he wants, but me, no one cares what I'm doing, because my show can be paid for by  advertisers that literally don't know what the show's about.  That's perfect.  If the show was a little more expensive, or on a little bit earlier, then, you know, 
[02:06:00]  I don't know who, Nescafe, or, you know?  Nescafe!  General Mills?  General Mills would say, who's this Louis person?  Procter and Gamble.  Yes, but right now, fucking some lawyer from New Jersey is paying for my show.  Changed out the fucking daughters and no one knew.  No, and also, I don't have that control contractually.  I don't have a deal that says I can do what I want.  The deal that I have that I signed says that FX has full control over the show, and that  they have to approve every decision that I make. 
[02:06:30]  But whether they do that or not is another thing.  In practice, they've never done it, but I earn that with every show.  If I turn in two shitty episodes, I'll start having an executive on the set, and I'll have  to turn in...  Fucking fingers in there.  But how great is that that they fucking allow that?  That's like, you're giving them a great product, and they're not fucking fucking with it.  They're leaving you alone.  That's so nice.  It's refreshing.  The way I got it was that I was willing not to do the show any other way.  I was willing to say no.  You have to really be willing to say no to stuff.  If you really want the gig, and you feel like you can't live without it, then you'll 
[02:07:00]  give away everything.  And it's so rough when you're close.  I would be like, well, we want to read scripts.  And I go, no, I'm not interested in doing it that way.  We established it with the pilot.  I said, this is the only way I'll do it.  You give me the money, I'll make a show.  Well, we'd like to find out who's in it.  Not interested in telling you that.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  And if you want to know who's in the show, then I'd rather not do it.  Like, I said that a few times through the process.  And meant it.  Yes, I did.  And I meant it.  Well, we'd like to visit your set.  I don't want you here, but I totally understand why you would want to come here, because you're 
[02:07:30]  paying for the show.  But I'd rather we just said, call it off.  Wow.  And I just kept saying that.  And they were so cool.  And the guy who runs FX, John Landgraf, is a genius.  And he said, he kept everybody off of me.  And it worked.  I gave them a show they liked.  If I'd given them a show that needed work, they would have been like, yes, we'll give you  a green light, but you need more supervision.  But they're like, keep doing it that way.  But he's the one who got me to do it without signing that.  He said, look, there's no deal that exists that covers this. 
[02:08:00]  Hitler, a love story, you could have come up with.  You could have done anything.  I could have done anything.  But since I turned in something that was basically funny and competent and didn't look crazy,  they said, okay, let's keep doing it as long as it works.  But episode by episode, I have to earn that.  So each episode, so far, they've liked.  And they just keep saying, all right, it's good.  They don't ever give me notes or anything.  They just let me know.  Oh, that's fucking great.  It's the best job I ever had.  Well, and that gives me freedom not only to do what I want and be edgy. 
[02:08:30]  It also, I don't have a good work ethic.  Like I can't complete things and I don't have a consistent focus.  Wow.  So I can do things like write half a sketch on the show or half a story.  And then I can't get around to finishing it.  But I go ahead and produce it anyway.  I get them to cast the parts and I start shooting it without an ending.  It totally comes across.  You totally come across to me as a guy that is the finish it guy. 
[02:09:00]  Well, it takes me a long time to finish stuff.  But I mean, to me, I really thought you were the kind of guy that like,  because from a lot of the short things I've seen you do online and things like that,  it's like I have an idea and I'm actually going to do it.  And you do it.  Some of them are like that.  Some things that I've done I know, like I have an idea and five minutes later I actually  know how it's going to be shot and finished and everything.  So you actually won't finish it sometimes.  You'll know where you want to start and kind of where you might want to end up and then  just know it's going to work out. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  Or I'll just shoot a scene that I know is funny and then I'll figure, I'll find a place  for it.  It doesn't have a context yet.  Well, you've got the confidence that you're going to get there.  Well, like in the episode on the show that's about religion, it starts with this thing  of me going into a public restroom and there's a glory hole.  And I didn't have a plan for that scene.  I just liked the idea of this glory hole thing.  And I started shooting it.  We shot it and it was totally different.  And then we shot it and I didn't like it actually.  And in the actual original version, the dude sticks his penis in this glory hole and he has 
[02:10:00]  this religious orgasm that I watched happen.  And that was the original thing.  And I watched it and it was just, it was gross.  It was creepy, creepy and weird and unfunny.  And so I shelled it.  I said, fuck this thing.  I forgot.  I mean, I have the ability to shoot something and then no one ever sees it.  So I figured I'm going to bury this.  It'll never be on television.  But then we started shooting the religion episode and it hit me. 
[02:10:30]  This would be it.  I could take just the beginning of that bit and have it just be a discussion starter.  Yeah.  For a little intro kind of.  Yeah.  So some stuff I shoot without knowing how I'm going to use it.  That's cool.  And there's been stuff that you shot that you probably haven't used, right?  Yeah.  There's whole bits that Nick DiPaolo, who's on the show a lot as himself, I originally  put him in a suit and tie and had him play almost like a Catskills.  Like he did.  He did kind of a character and he wore a suit and tie.  Like, and I just like they had this weird idea that there's an old timey Dean Martin kind 
[02:11:00]  of comedian in the midst of a comedian in the midst of these, and I have one bit, one whole  thing that I shot with him and that character that never will be on the show.  But it's on the DVD.  I thought it's on the DVD.  You should put it on a nightmare scene for Nick.  Yeah.  Nick has a nightmare that that's who he is.  I was going to, I was going to say DVD with no.  And also because I don't make serious deals with people and because nobody cares who's  on the show, I can like Bob Kelly. 
[02:11:30]  I hope he's, I mean, I, I should probably call him after Robert Kelly, who played my  brother on the show.  So he, he, I didn't have any plans to have a brother on the show.  It's just, I wrote one scene for him and he really nailed it.  And I, he had that really pathetic quality to that.  Bob has, uh, that you just want to punch him and hug him.  Oh, the diner scenes.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  And so he was so good in that and that I gave him a few more episodes this season.  I might not have him on.  You're basically saying you don't have a brother anymore. 
[02:12:00]  I don't have a brother because I don't have a brother in real life.  Happy days.  Hey, fat Chuck, how does that feel?  Can we call Bobby right now?  No, no, no, I don't want to hurt him.  He, and he might, he might.  He's tremendous.  Bobby's great.  Everything I'm writing, I'm writing season two right now and it's, and I haven't written  a bit for him and I've, and I introduced a sister into the show cause I have actually  three sisters.  So I have a sister character.  So he may not be on, but then I, the other day I came up with a bit, I thought that actually 
[02:12:30]  might be good for him.  But I, he also might come back as a different character.  I don't know.  I'm serious.  You should have him come back as two people at once cause he's put weight on just to humiliate  him.  He's in the car though.  It is such perfect Bobby when he's just like, Hey dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  No, Jim is in one season, one scene last year and probably I'll use him as a totally different  guy.  He's in his himself with a fucking necklace over his t-shirt like an asshole.  Did I have a necklace on? 
[02:13:00]  Necklace over the t-shirt.  I was probably, I was, I think, was that the, that was my lucky Louie thing, the Pam game.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That's why, that's the only reason I wore, I never wore jewelry.  I hate jewelry.  That was, that poker scene was some great writing.  But I do characters too.  So if you need a character, like a French guy or whatever.  Do you have one of those?  Come on, try one out.  Do you know me?  I will be happy to be on.  Fucking good, man.  You know what would be great?  A French guy.  Would be to actually have him on as a French guy and say that he's a French guy and have 
[02:13:30]  him do that.  To have it be like a French, like a bakery I go into, and he goes, oh, it's so nice to  see you.  Oh, Louis.  Do the guy.  Like, hey, good morning.  I am so happy you came to my bakery.  Can I get, do you have other croissants this morning?  They are delicious and hot.  Just the way you like them.  All of a sudden you're German.  But there was a whole World War II thing with my family.  I'm writing backstory.  He's Alsatian.  He's Alsatian, French.  He's Vichy. 
[02:14:00]  I could almost totally see doing that.  Why not?  Just have him play this broad and don't just have it be this character.  No explanation.  Nothing.  And maybe we have one of those, like as a character, we have one of those, ah, it's  been a tough day with the kids.  You know, fatherhood is tough, right, Francois?  Oh, yes.  It is tough to raise them properly.  You have to let them go.  Fucking good, man.  He's got wisdom.  He's got a little wisdom.  Yeah, a lot of wisdom.  You close your eyes, you can see the parade.  If I turn that show on and saw that, I'd shit my pants. 
[02:14:30]  I would shit my pants.  I'll just do really hacky French jokes.  Well, if you're children, you should surrender.  And just an aside.  Surrender.  You can see him just walking down the street and just say hello to him.  And he's got the paper bag with a baguette sticking out of it.  Yes.  And some celery and a beret on.  But I'll have to make sure the audience knows.  Like, you'll say something.  I'll be glad you came in because I am French.  That's right. 
[02:15:00]  See, I love the idea of doing this because, like, Ricky Gervais' character didn't fit the  rest of the season at all because I didn't do any other cartoonly stupid characters like  that.  I did one.  And there's people that complained about it.  Like, this doesn't fit.  And I'm like, so what?  Fuck you.  I mean, one thing I love to do on my show is that even the most, the people that are the  biggest fans of the show have things that make them upset about it.  That makes me happy.  Like in the pilot when the girl gets in the helicopter and flies away, a lot of people  are like, that's where it really, yeah, it did really. 
[02:15:30]  So fuck you.  I wanted to do it.  That's my show.  Right.  If you don't like it, stop watching.  If there's enough of you guys, I'll get fired.  That's what we say all the time.  I don't give a shit.  So it would be great if next season is really down to earth and real and really, you know,  just believable, incredible, but there's this one sore thumb piece of shit, not even  played by a guy who knows how to do it.  Like, it would be bad enough to get a stereotypical French guy who actually is, you know, trained,  but this guy doesn't even have any handle on the accent. 
[02:16:00]  It's not what he's known for to use Jimmy that way.  But you got to go all in and have him in every episode just to really hammer the awfulness  home.  Oh, that would be horrid every fucking episode.  That would be great.  It's like, what's his name?  Will Ferrell told me that he used to have in his head these couple watching SNL, he would  imagine, and he would do moments that he used to call holy moly moments, where the husband  of the couple, he would do things on SNL that he pictured the guy going, holy moly. 
[02:16:30]  Jesus.  What the hell is he doing?  That's what this is going to be.  That's a holy moly.  I think we're probably doing it too, so Jim.  Jim, get ready.  I've been working on my French accent for fucking, since about 8.48.  You got to do it now.  It's an obnoxious thing to do.  By the way, was that the pilot also that Chelsea was in?  Chelsea's the one who got in a helicopter and flew away.  When you open the door and pin her behind the door.  Yes.  That is one of the best awkward scenes ever. 
[02:17:00]  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  The thing that was amazing about that to me was that I wrote that, and then they went  and, I mean, I wrote it in the script.  It wasn't something that we just sort of found.  Right.  I said, the door is too close to the stairs, and when he opens the door, there's nowhere  for her to go but behind it.  And so he holds it open and pinning her.  I wrote that, and they had to go find the, the, the, the scouts had to find that.  Yeah, because now logistically, you've got to find a door that works like that.  They had to scour the East Village and find a building that was willing to let us shoot 
[02:17:30]  there that would have that situation.  Yeah, without it looking like we forced it.  I do hate the awkward double door, try to hold the door for the girl thing.  Because now she's in, and some girls know how to actually kind of stop there and wait.  Right.  And you could open it, but then most of them lunge for it and open, and now she's opening  the door for you, and then you've got to make the whole tit for tat joke.  Oh, then you did it for me, which is funny.  Now we're even.  Now we're laughing at unfunny moments. 
[02:18:00]  Exactly.  You held it for me.  Door.  I can't wait for this to be over.  Can't wait to fuck your ass and throw you out my window.  Fucking moderately amusing cunt.  Moderately amusing cunt.  That's, some comedian should have that as a special.  Whitney Cummings next special.  Sorry.  Just picked one out of the hat.  I know you just picked a woman you shouldn't do. 
[02:18:30]  I'll find out.  Pick the woman out of the hat.  That's what I always do.  Hey, Louie, the open to the show, a guy flips off the fucking camera.  Yeah.  And there's some discussion about that.  Yeah.  If you set that up or if that was real.  Oh, no.  That was, if I had set it up, that would have been a shitty way to do it.  Yeah.  But, no, when we shot that, the last night of the pilot shooting, we shot the stand-up at  the Comedy Cellar.  And we were figuring out as we were going along how to do that.  And I got a Steadicam operator to stand on stage with me at the Cellar. 
[02:19:00]  That's how we shot that.  And so you get that first-person feeling.  Right.  It's the same way I shot the stand-up on Hilarious on the special that's out at 10 o'clock.  Nice.  Someday on Comedy Central and then later on DVD.  And you do it.  And Netflix.  You do acknowledge the camera at one point.  Yeah.  Oh, during the Hilarious special.  Yeah, because he got too close.  Yeah, yeah.  And I could hear the guy's cans.  I could hear the tech director talking to the camera person.  Okay, go to three, we're going to Pakistan, and you're trying to fucking do it. 
[02:19:30]  I actually hear her telling him what he's doing.  Go a little closer.  You can get closer, Jim.  You can get closer.  It is a weird moment.  And I'm talking to a fucking audience of 2,000 people during a set that I've been preparing  for a year.  Yeah, I'm glad you left that in.  And I had to turn to him and say, you get it back off because I can hear you.  Yeah, it's a weird moment.  But we left it in because it is a strange...  I think if you watch the show High, that's probably a really fucked up moment.  Right, because you're just absorbed in it. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, you feel like...  And all of a sudden, you go ahead.  You know what would have been a funny thing to say?  Hey, Captain Obvious, you want to back it up?  I'm thinking of this stuff later.  Back to the guy who flipped off the camera.  Okay, so...  Sorry.  Dying.  Sorry.  Okay, the guy...  So we shot at the Comedy Cellar with a Steadicam.  And then when we were done, we were sitting...  I was standing out in the village.  It was the summer.  And the village in the summer is just so active. 
[02:20:30]  And I thought, maybe I should shoot a moment outside.  And then it hit me.  I don't have an opening sequence to the show.  I don't have a way to open.  And just to hand something into FX, just to give them something.  I assume we'll shoot some kind of a really slick opening someday for this show.  But just to have something to give them when we turn in the pilot.  Because they only gave us $200,000 to do the pilot.  Which is very low money for a pilot.  Yeah, yeah.  So we had a Steadicam guy there.  Which is a very expensive rig and person. 
[02:21:00]  And I said, why don't we just put the guy's Steadicam on with a 25 lens.  Doesn't matter.  And I'll walk from the 3rd Street subway to the Comedy Cellar.  Which is my walk.  That's how I get to work every night.  And just walk in front of me with the camera.  And we'll just shoot that.  And so we're walking.  We did exactly that.  I came out of the subway.  We only did it once.  And he followed me.  And then I got to...  I just followed my instincts.  I got to Ben's Pizza on McDougal Street. 
[02:21:30]  And went in for a slice.  That's why I always do get a couple of chomps.  Because usually what happens is I put my kids to sleep.  And then I get a babysitter to come.  And then I run to the cellar.  And I haven't eaten.  I fed them dinner and put them to bed.  So I just need a little bit of calories in me to do a set.  So I started eating the pizza.  And the camera stayed there.  And just watched me eat pizza.  And these young Asian kids with spiky hair.  Kind of like cool alt punky kids walk by. 
[02:22:00]  And they see a camera.  So they like think, oh, fuck you.  Like this kind of...  Just, you know what I mean?  Young people contrary to anything.  You know, oh, fuck you, man.  And the kid really did it like that.  Like you can't hear it because there's no sound.  But he's...  And he was stupid that he didn't, you know...  He could have just stood in front of the camera.  But as he walked by, like, fuck you.  Like you did it like that.  And I just watched him. 
[02:22:30]  And I kept a straight face.  You can see me glance at him after he gives me the finger.  And I thought...  And I thought because I saw...  I know the scope of the lens that we had on.  I'm like, I know we just caught that.  And I know it's out of focus.  And I'm so happy that just happened.  That's just so...  And it was a moment that I thought, this show is going to be on TV.  Like that moment.  Literally, when he flipped off the camera, I thought...  Because I was like, that's so cool that that's going to be in the opening credits.  And I knew this is going to be the opening credits to the show. 
[02:23:00]  I'm not replacing this.  And I think we're going to get on the air.  Like it just made me believe.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of the fun...  To me, the coolness of getting this middle...  This legitimate, sincere middle finger in this New York City show.  That New York City moment.  One of the funniest things that happened on Lucky Louie to me was we were doing a scene.  And there was a woman who was a bartender.  And she had a shirt on.  And on the shirt was like the little clear tag that had like L, L, L, like for large.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, you know when it went from the Gap.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just forget to take those off the back of your leg.  And we're rehearsing.  And Louie goes to me, all I want is for that to be shot on television.  Yeah.  That's so bad.  Yeah.  And it was a thing.  I don't think we had it taken off.  I don't know if they took it off or they caught it.  But you're like, I just don't want them to catch that.  I want her to have that on television.  Oh, no.  I love when imperfect things happen.  And awful things.  That's great.  And I go, we're using that.  It's easier to do on this show than Lucky Louie.  There was some level of people trying to perfect stuff all the time. 
[02:24:00]  And that used to make me irritated.  Look how easy it is to just pull shit up.  I was very happy when it came on Netflix, by the way.  I love the opening of this fucking show.  Yeah, this is just, I was really tired.  We'd been shooting all day.  Yeah, you look very natural.  Like, that's how you look walking.  And actually, it backs up if you know the geography of the village.  Yeah, you walked past it already, Louie.  What the fuck?  There he is.  And then you give a little glance over to him.  You're dead.  I just missed it.  I looked down.  A little glance over, like, what the fuck? 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  There he is.  Right on.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  A camera.  Fuck you, man.  He's so anti-establishment, dude.  The camera represents the eye of the man.  No, and this font is just what was, I use it for other shit.  Yeah.  And we kept it.  I didn't.  Yes, it was passed.  That's passed by about a block.  How much do you have to pay for the song?  I'll tell you about that in a second, because I couldn't afford the song. 
[02:25:00]  Here comes the dude.  And I look up.  That's great.  There's me looking, and I'm going, awesome.  You just look over.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  And I look back.  No, and that moment of me looking is me thinking, I've got my own TV show again.  I honestly felt that way.  No, the song, and the song I picked off of iTunes or whatever and threw it on for the  sake of the, you know, for just to, again, just to have something to hand in as a complete  thing.  And then John Langrath, the guy who runs FX, when he saw it, he said, I think Louis fits 
[02:25:30]  into it.  And also, I didn't know I was going to call it that.  I just did that as a thing.  And he said, I think Louis fits in.  I like the opening.  I like the song.  He took it as the way the show is supposed to be.  And then I needed to go get, yeah, then I needed to go get this song, Brother Louis,  which was originally recorded by a band called Hot Chocolate, and then it was re-recorded  by The Stories.  And so we went after it, and our legal tiny department, and they said they would give us, 
[02:26:00]  well, yeah, there's the publishing, and then there's the recording.  The publishing is the actual, like, the song, the lyrics, and the arrangement, and that costs  us, we'd pay $5,000 an episode for that, which for us, a $300,000 a show, that's a lot.  That's a chunk of our budget.  That is a lot.  Wait, is that a lot of the budget?  Now, is that a publisher and the artists have to get the same thing, I think?  That was a way to prevent it?  Well, some people own both.  Oh, yeah.  The master recording is a different group of people, because actually, we pay Hot Chocolate 
[02:26:30]  for the publishing, or whoever owns their publishing, because they wrote it.  But the Stories version is the one that we wanted.  Oh, okay.  Because of that guy, Louis, Louis!  Ian Lloyd, that singer, the Hot Chocolate version is like eight guys going, Louis, Louis, Louis.  It's not as fun.  So we recorded our own version of it.  Reggie Watts was a comic.  Oh, yeah, Reggie.  He did the music for the first half of the season, and then we didn't have enough to finish 
[02:27:00]  it with him, we did it with other people.  But he arranged and recorded the music for it that we did, which is almost identical to  the Stories version.  Wow.  I think it's a little better.  It's just a little nicer.  And then we did a version where he sang it, where Reggie sang it, and it didn't work.  And we tried to think of another way to create that sound, and we couldn't.  I was in the studio with Reggie at midnight, because all the music on this series, I do  it with a group of musicians. 
[02:27:30]  It's all original music.  Wow.  Jesus.  But when we were doing the theme song, it was like, I can't, how are we going to do  this?  And then I thought, well, whatever happened to the stories?  Like, whatever happened to the lead singer?  So I went on the internet, yeah, and I googled Ian Lloyd.  First of all, I googled the stories.  I don't know who the fuck he was at the time.  And I found a YouTube video of him doing it on American Bandstand, and he's, Louie, Louie!  And so I googled his name, and Ian Lloyd is just a guy living in New York City, and he 
[02:28:00]  has a band.  It's his son's band, but he's, like, sings Jesus.  And so he's got a little website that he obviously hadn't updated since, like, 1989 or something.  And there's an email on it.  So it's, like, midnight, and I write a, you know, Hail Mary email.  Hi, I'm a TV producer, and I want to hire you to do a job.  Write me if you're interested.  And the next morning, I wake up to an email.  This is, yes, this is my current email.  Please, please help me. 
[02:28:30]  This is my phone number.  And he gave me his phone number.  So I call him up, and he's the fucking greatest guy in the world.  And he's just happy to still be singing.  And I kind of asked, sort of carefully, do you still have the pipes to do what you did  on the song?  He said, sure, I do.  And I told him, look, here's the thing.  Oh, because the song, when we went to try to get it, it was, like, fucking $20,000 an  episode they wanted for the recording.  For the recording of it, right.  And they wouldn't back down, and we can't afford it.  So I went to Ian, and I said, can we just hire you as a singer for a day? 
[02:29:00]  That's all I can really afford to do.  I have no money for this show.  And he said, well, I need you to pay me enough that I don't want to kill myself.  He said, basically, I'm happy to do this for you.  I just need to have some self-respect, you know.  So I offered him some money, and he said, that's fine.  And he came, he showed up.  It was one of my favorite experiences ever on the show, because he was such a good guy.  And he remembered how he recorded it. 
[02:29:30]  He remembered there's a couple of tracks, and he harmonized with himself.  And he helped us with it.  And the only thing, I had him do it exactly the way he did it in the original.  And his voice is a little older, but I like it that ours is a little different.  And also, I asked him to say, instead of, Louie, you're going to cry.  The second time, he says, Louie, Louie, you're going to die.  I just asked him to make that one change, which he did.  Wow.  And he nailed it.  So we have a version that zero people believe is anything but the original stories version. 
[02:30:00]  Without having to pay.  Without having to pay that money, which would be going to Ian Lloyd.  Unfortunately, he probably fucked himself.  He fucked himself over.  No, and I felt bad, because when I did Carnegie Hall, I had this idea to have him sing live to introduce me.  And I thought that would be so cool.  And he'd go crazy singing Carnegie Hall.  I'm sure he didn't see that coming in his future.  But the people at Carnegie Hall, if you do music, they charge you like you're a fucking symphony orchestra. 
[02:30:30]  Like you're the Philharmonic.  So I couldn't afford it, but they printed the programs that says, with special guest Ian Lloyd on my Carnegie Hall.  A collector's item.  But, no, he's a great guy.  But there's been people on the internet that are like, this can't be the stories version, because it says you're going to die.  And I have the stories version.  I've listened to both back to back.  Like, they don't notice the daughter change, but they notice that fucking shit.  Luke, couldn't you have him sing live if you had a recording, or is it just if music's being played? 
[02:31:00]  Like, if you had the music taped?  Well, at that point, I wanted to have like a little combo band, and then they said that would cost a lot.  And then they said, well, you could do it with playback.  And then I said, well, I just don't want to do it.  So you just called me out on a line.  I really just kind of backed out on hiring you.  But I never told him I was going to hire him.  For comparison, we got the original.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Right at the hook.  The stories version.  A little slower. 
[02:31:30]  He's a little grittier now.  A little more in his voice.  All right, and then we're just...  What made you think it was song for the show?  Yeah.  Thank you, Luke.  Dan, you got the other one?  That's for me, buddy.  What?  Oh, you want me?  No, yeah, you got the...  No, the original from the open.  From the open.  Lou, your version's way better.  I think I like it better.  You really updated it.  Let's see.  There we go.  My bad.  This opening is from the hot chocolate version. 
[02:32:00]  They open this way.  The stories version is more 70s stringy in the beginning.  Yeah, there's more strings here.  Yeah.  It sounds almost like...  Sounds good.  What's the guy who did Fred is Dead?  Fred is Dead.  That's what I said.  Yes, like that...  Who is that guy?  Was this a popular song?  Yeah, it was a hit.  Curtis Mayfield, I think.  Curtis Mayfield. 
[02:32:30]  The music is a little Curtis Mayfield.  Wow.  That strings better.  Wow.  I always thought that...  Die!  I thought that was the original lyric.  No.  I told right this moment.  Doesn't exist in the original.  That's fucking...  Your version's way better.  I just...  I love him, this crooning singer saying,  you're gonna die.  You're gonna cry.  What a great anecdote. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, usually those back scenes things are boring.  That was pretty good.  No, that was very...  And you fucked that guy over.  You totally fucked him over with his help.  You so fucked him.  With his help.  He has horrible representation.  He wouldn't start getting checks from ASCAP.  They'd be coming every time the show is on.  Netflix.  Everything would have been paying this guy.  Fucking DVD.  Boom, boom.  Instead he got a day rate.  You had such a great experience with the guy,  but you fucked him over.  I own Ian Lloyd. 
[02:33:30]  He's a good man.  I always get emails from him when he's in town and stuff.  Put him in an episode.  He's a good man.  No, I'm going to.  He also wants to act too, so I'll put him in some.  How old is he?  I have no idea.  Is he black or white?  50s, 50s, white guy.  Scrawny, white guy.  Yeah.  Nobody has that voice.  I mean, that's a testament to what he did  that fucking 30 years later,  I couldn't find anybody that could replicate that sound.  There's no white guy.  That is amazing, yeah.  What is that?  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  What kind of...  There's no...  It's not soprano or something.  It's heroin.  Oh, that's him right there?  Yeah.  Hey, he looks all right.  Hey, listen.  He's awesome.  Why don't we take a break?  Fishing captain.  Louie, you going to make it to the end with us  or do you got to go somewhere?  Yeah, I'll hang around.  Okay, good.  Louie C.K., he's here to promote Hilarious,  which is going to be on Comedy Central  Sunday night at 10 p.m.,  and then it'll be available on CD and DVD Tuesday.  Yes, it will.  Hilarious is great.  Thank you.  More with Louie C.K.  Stay there. 
[02:34:30]  Talking to Louie C.K. 
[02:35:00]  I don't know if what we were just talking about  is worth talking about on the air,  but I was telling Louie when I walk around in my dumb life,  so many people come up to me and tell me  one of their favorite episodes of Louie's show  was the one where he follows the kid home  that kind of threatened him in the donut shop,  and then the episode ends with Louie  just kind of hanging out on the stoop with the kid's father.  He follows him all the way to Staten Island,  and there's not a lot of laughs in there,  but people loved that episode, 
[02:35:30]  but it also, you were saying,  frustrates or pisses off people  because they weren't laughing.  I don't get that.  Because that could have been my favorite episode.  I think it was one of my favorite ones.  I mean, I don't look at stuff on TV  as segregated comedy or drama.  Most things, actually, that are sold as comedies  don't make me laugh.  I haven't watched a comedy movie  that's really made me laugh.  Oh, please, you didn't go see the Flockers movie? 
[02:36:00]  Come on, Louie.  Yeah, that's a movie made for you, Louie.  That's made for you.  Robert De Niro, his comedies are so bad,  but his dramas are hilarious.  To me, two of the funniest movies in history  are Goodfellas and Raging Bull.  Two hilarious movies not sold as comedies  that are not supposed to be funny.  What was the last comedy you laughed at?  Do you remember?  Fuck, I don't know.  Maybe Dumb and Dumber.  Wow.  Like, that made me laugh  just because of how dumb and dumber it was.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:36:30]  But other than that,  I haven't really laughed at a lot of comedy.  Sometimes I watch Family Guy on Netflix  to fall asleep.  Like, it's something that actually helps me fall asleep.  And it makes me laugh really hard.  But there's something...  Because it's a cartoon,  I think it's just because the cartoons put me to sleep.  Because it's one-dimensional  and it has a sing-songy way of it.  Family Guy has these voices.  They talk like...  So it kind of puts me to sleep.  It's kind of funny that you say that.  And I kind of hated it the first time I saw it 
[02:37:00]  because it's so jokey.  But I gave it a chance  because you should...  Love the characters.  When you adjust to something you're not used to.  That's what a lot of people just won't do that.  They're like,  this isn't what I am sure is already good.  So I hate it.  This is not what I'm used to.  But if you make an adjustment  and actually if something's not what you're used to  then you might find a new thing to laugh at  which there's nothing better in life.  And if Family Guy does that for me  it surprises me with a constant stream of jokes. 
[02:37:30]  And then I go to sleep.  You made a great point during the break  when we were just chick-chatting.  You said you like being surprised by things.  Yeah, that's the best thing you can do.  Fuck yeah.  Is to find entertainment or humor or intrigue  in a location of people's minds  that they haven't found it before.  And it goes back to that poker scene you did  which Jim Norton's in and all the guys  where you guys are just busting each other's balls.  Yeah, it starts as just...  And also because it was early in the season  I liked that people would be...  I mean, I'm aware of where people...  The context of an episode now 
[02:38:00]  from having done...  Lucky Louie taught me a lot  as far as just coming on TV all of a sudden  and what that means.  So I knew people would be like...  They'd start watching the poker scene thinking  okay, so we're going to once in a while  see Louie and his buddies playing poker.  This is an introduction.  And they banter and they make gay jokes  because that's just what fellas are like.  And then the show...  That episode just stumbles into this  fucked up territory  and then all of a sudden you're not laughing  and you're watching this guy talk about this thing 
[02:38:30]  and then I make a joke in the middle of it  which is really inappropriate.  And so it's no...  Wait a minute.  Am I supposed to be laughing at this or not?  Right.  And then it goes away.  The episode isn't even about that  and we never saw that group of guys again.  I fucking hate you.  I'll tell you why.  Because you just explained what I thought.  Like okay, the poker...  Yeah, but hate's not the way to deal with it.  No, I hate Louie.  But I thought you were going to keep going back.  That would be a central thing of your show.  Right.  Absolutely.  I bought into that.  Like okay, they're going to be doing poker  every once in a while.  Right. 
[02:39:00]  To just kind of have a little fun  and beat each other up.  Yeah, never again.  And it never happened again.  No, no.  You surprised me with that.  We might in season two  have another poker game.  I don't know.  Right.  I don't know.  But you didn't have to go there again.  No, I didn't have to.  Other shows would have.  Other shows would have made...  Every show would have.  Well, there were some lines that were made up.  Every show would have done it.  Definitely.  You should have done something  like we were playing cards  and someone should have said  liquor in the front,  poker in the back  and just give you a little finger like that.  A little finger on the side.  Yeah, a little joke.  That would have been good.  Yeah.  We'll come back and do that.  No, and we didn't come back to it 
[02:39:30]  and other shows would have been pressured  by a network to...  We love the poker, guys.  Please do more poker, right.  Let's hear what Eddie Brill has to say this week.  Maybe he gets sad.  Yeah.  Oh, they would have.  And not only would they do poker,  but every poker scene  would start with guys razzing each other  and then getting serious.  It would have happened over and over.  Yeah, same exact way.  Oh, God.  They just know how to unfunny shit up.  There was originally a second scene 
[02:40:00]  to the poker thing,  and we shot it and I didn't use it,  which is that at the end,  it was going to be kind of bookends  that at the end of the episode,  I'm on stage  because I used to do the bits  about the word faggot, cunt, and nigger.  That was my chunk of inappropriate words bits  that I did then.  Inappropriate.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  And so I do the poker thing  to address the word faggot,  and then you see me on stage  doing my bit about nigger  and people saying n-word  instead of nigger and that stuff.  And then Hannibal Bress,  who's in the poker scene,  the black comedian, 
[02:40:30]  comes up to me and goes,  hey, man, you know,  I see you banished faggot from your act,  but you got nigger going strong.  What's up with that?  And I'm like, well, I don't mean it.  That was like, yeah, no, I get it,  but I hear Rick say all this stuff.  Do I have to now explain to you  what nigger means?  Does that, you know?  And I'm like, jeez, come on, man.  And he's like, I'm just saying,  if you're going to say nigger,  say faggot.  I mean, it's not fair.  So we actually shot it  and then didn't use it  because the sound was shitty  and just didn't.  Oh, really?  Yeah, otherwise I probably  would have kept it.  How great is that the network 
[02:41:00]  lets you say nigger and faggot,  though, in the right context.  It's just great  that they don't fucking bother you.  It's so nice.  Well, the standards person at FX  is really smart,  and she calls me whenever we,  you know,  actually that poker scene  was much dirtier at one point.  Really?  And John Landgraf,  the FX president,  called me and said  that he loved the scene  and that he wanted  to put it early in the run  so that it would get reviewed  and it would be part of  what people would notice  about the show.  He said, but it's too dirty.  He said, if you want to keep it 
[02:41:30]  as dirty as it is,  we have to bury it  like 12 episodes deep.  Wow.  Because it's so,  it was so,  just cum,  every other word,  cum, cum,  suck, cock up the ass,  eat dicks, cum.  And he said,  if you can tone it,  he said,  if you can tone it down  in just the amount of times  you use those words,  then I,  and he said,  but it's totally your choice.  He said,  I think it's worth it  because then that,  that episode will get,  that's a weighty scene  and it's worth doing.  So I went through it 
[02:42:00]  to see if I could cut it down  without hurting it  and I cut out like,  this is part where,  where I go,  where I say,  how come you have to wear shoes  at the club  and Rick says,  because the floor gets  full of cum  and Nick DiPaolo goes,  all right,  we get it  and so I cut him,  I manufactured a cut off  where Rick goes,  well,  the floor gets full up,  all right,  and he cuts him off  and doesn't let him say it.  Right,  I manufactured that  in the editing  and I realized,  you know what,  this is actually  making the scene better.  Sure.  That Nick gets nervous enough 
[02:42:30]  about the stuff  that he stops it  from being said  and I used that way  of cutting it down  and I didn't have to cut out  as much as I thought I would  and I showed it to Langrath  and he said,  we can do that  and I'm so glad we did  because that episode  partly is the reason  the show got notoriety.  And that scene's gone viral  for you.  Yeah,  and I got,  there's this website  for gay people  called afterelton.com,  it's a very big gay website  and they called me up,  this guy called me up  and said,  well,  I don't understand  how this scene 
[02:43:00]  talking about gay people  came from a straight guy.  He's like,  and he wanted to know  how a straight person  ends up with this point of view.  Oh,  maybe I'm gay,  I don't know.  I don't know,  I haven't sucked a dick yet.  But hey,  if I'm a closet gay,  let me find out soon.  I'm almost fucking 50.  Get it out in the open  so I can start taking advantage.  How awesome would that be  to all of a sudden  open your fucking horizons?  At 50,  you can just go,  ah,  fuck it.  Oh my God, 
[02:43:30]  there's twice as many people  I can fucking have.  Apparently,  that's exactly what was  tweeted on my fucking  Twitter yesterday.  It said,  for the new year,  I'm going to try buy  so I can double my  choice out there  because I had left  my iPad out  and Keith the cop  was over the house  and decided to tweet  as me.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  Wow.  It said,  in the new year,  I resolved to try buy.  I mean,  why not double my odds? 
[02:44:00]  And that's what he  fucking does.  Well,  that's what a friend does.  And I had to put  Jesus fucking Keith  got my Twitter again.  I'm not trying to be bi.  I really need to sign out  of Twitter when I'm asleep.  Why did you need to  dispel that, though?  Yeah,  you should just  left it out there.  How are you hurt by that?  Well,  I'm so homophobic  and I'm so insecure  about my own masculinity  that I feel I have to do that.  I don't know why.  Now that I'm reading it,  I'm like,  yeah,  why the fuck  did I feel compelled 
[02:44:30]  to do that?  I think it's more of a  I just want to  give a fuck you  to Keith  more so than  having to explain.  I don't think I had  to explain that I'm  again,  yeah,  nearing the big  5-0 mark  and just deciding  I want to be bi.  I don't think I really  had to explain that  more so.  It's,  oh,  look,  look at what  asshole Keith did again.  I remember I was  dead at a show years ago  with a guy named  Tony V.  Do you know Tony V?  He's a comic from Boston.  I don't know.  Very funny guy. 
[02:45:00]  And we did the show.  He's a really big guy  dressed as kind of  like a biker  but he's also  kind of weird  so he was wearing  paisley boots  like colorful paisley boots  and then a biker jacket  and we were doing  a show in Rhode Island  and some guy yells out  it was at a college  and this kid yells out  faggot  and Tony V,  big burly guy  and goes,  what?  He goes,  look at your boots  you're a faggot  and Tony goes,  well,  let's examine that  for a second.  What if I was a faggot?  What if I was gay  and I decided  I wanted to take you 
[02:45:30]  out back by my car  and force you down  over the hood of my car  and fuck you in the ass?  If I had decided  to do that,  you know what you could do  about it?  Nothing.  There's nothing you could do.  I'm bigger than you.  I'm smarter than you.  I would just take you.  And he goes,  so you better pray  I'm not a faggot.  You better hope  you're wrong, man.  That's a great way  to handle it.  Yeah,  who cares if somebody  thinks you're gay?  I really couldn't care this.  If there was some way  something came out  that I was gay,  I would never,  I'm here to declare 
[02:46:00]  that these allegations  are false.  I'd just go,  yeah,  all right.  I want to say that.  Yeah,  who cares?  Yes,  I'm gay.  I'm not making,  I'm not backtracking  because we make enough  dick suck jokes  in this place  and self-deprecating  homo jokes and stuff.  But I think it was  more of a just,  oh,  fuck,  look,  asshole got my fucking  Twitter account again  and did that.  I never care what  people think.  You know,  you make up a few  tranny stories,  people start to think  that it's real. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Oopsie.  Wacky people.  Oopsie.  Sure they do.  We got a lot of people  that want to say hi to Louie.  Now that you're a big star,  Louie.  No.  He's really famous.  Yeah.  I just keep looking at him.  He's so famous.  I've always kind of  crossed over to a place  where I'd have to go  through in for me  to get out now.  Like I'd have to do  something bad.  Really bad.  Yeah,  yeah.  Otherwise it's going to  just be a half-life  like uranium.  It'll be.  I think we kind of  the truth is  the show  I already see the road 
[02:47:00]  back down.  This this year  this season of the show  everyone says  it's just not as good  as the second.  People love  to do that.  People love taking  shows with promise  saying you know what  wasn't as good.  Sophomore jinx.  John Langreff gets fired  third season.  I'm off the air.  I go back on the road.  I'm not as inspired  as I've been in the past.  I put out one shitty special  and it's over.  I'm back at the Tempe Improv  for three thousand bucks a week. 
[02:47:30]  This leads to movies.  I already know  that leads to movies low.  And I know I can't  handle the Tempe Improv  at three thousand a week  at this point.  So I don't have a good  so I go back  the next year  and they're like  we don't even want you.  And then I'm teaching  college.  Maybe if I'm lucky  teaching college.  You drive by all the theaters  to get to the local  comedy club.  Remembering the days  when you're at the theater.  And fucking you know  Daniel Tosh  doesn't say hi to me  when he walks by.  Daniel. 
[02:48:00]  Hey what's up?  No I'm not a fan  I'm actually a comic.  Okay.  It's fine.  No Daniel.  Remember I used to know you.  That's fine.  Okay.  Alright.  Daniel can't talk to you right now.  No I know him.  No I know Daniel Tosh.  I do.  What's worse than that phony  like hey man  how you doing?  Oh yeah.  Oh man.  Really?  Really?  Oh it's fucking horrible.  Oh man.  Yeah.  Oh it's brutal.  Yeah it's Jim.  Jim.  No of course Jim. 
[02:48:30]  Hey I want to go to the phones  because a lot of people  want to say hi to Louis CK.  The big special is this Sunday  at 10 p.m. on Comedy Central.  Hilarious.  And it will be available  on DVD and CD  Tuesday January 11th.  Let's say hi to Howard  in Miami.  Howard.  Louis loves the show.  Thank you Howard.  Hey tell us about  your Sarah Palin tweet.  Yeah you kind of  talked about it earlier.  Where have you been?  Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  I was just drunk  and she fascinates me.  That's all.  That's it. 
[02:49:00]  You don't think  she has a real shot right?  No I think she  could get nominated  and then lose.  Yeah.  She has no shot  at winning the presidency.  I don't think so.  She's not a good enough  debater and honestly  I don't think she's  bright enough to play  on that level.  And I'm not shitting on her  I just don't think she can.  I think she knows that too  and she's just kind of  enjoying the attention  everyone gives her.  Well I yeah.  I don't think she even  believes in herself.  She's smart enough  that she's can't.  I don't think.  Well she didn't even  want to be governor.  Right.  She didn't want to do it.  She's doing a reality show  now because of shit.  But I don't know 
[02:49:30]  under the right circumstances  something weird could happen.  I mean I'm not saying  that she's  like I called her  the new Hitler  on Twitter once  and the person from FX  said you can't compare her  to a person who killed  six million Jews  and I said  well I'm not comparing her  to that.  I'm comparing her  to like early Hitler.  Early Hitler.  Yeah.  The way that Hitler wrote  there is a comparison.  It doesn't mean she's  going to end up  killing the same amount  of Jews.  Early Hitler.  But she's starting out  a very similar way 
[02:50:00]  which is to be  extremely inflammatory  go to the right  of the right wing  which is what she did.  Attack the conservatives  as not being  conservative enough  and create this  reactionary fucked up party  and take a few seats  in the legislature  and then take a few seats  more.  And I mean this is  what Hitler did.  Hitler was elected  to power.  People forget that.  Oh yeah.  He took the Reichstag  in little pieces  and then they started  doing stuff  like all of them  would stand up  and walk out  during votes 
[02:50:30]  so that nothing  could get done  and then he created  a fake explosion  and fire  in the German capital  and said it was  terrorism  and then based on that  they created  emergency measures  and then he got  re-elected  and then he made  himself Fuhrer.  She could do that.  Fuhrer.  It's easier to do  with a parliamentary system  like they have in Europe.  Yeah it's a little rough.  President is harder  to take that way.  I think it's kind of tough.  It's easier for somebody  to rise to power  in the presidency  like Castro 
[02:51:00]  or Obama  did.  Look.  I have to bash.  Yes.  I have to bash.  Totally.  I understand.  The socialist.  I understand.  Let's go to Jersey.  Eddie.  Hey guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  First time caller.  Love the show.  Hi Eddie.  Listen.  Louie.  Yeah.  There's a scene  you shot in one  of the episodes  at the airport.  I wish you guys  had played.  It was one of the  funniest things  I've seen  and I'm 57  so I've been 
[02:51:30]  watching TV  since you had  to get up  and change the channel.  It's a long time  Eddie.  Yeah I know  but there's a  you got the guy  at the counter  losing his mind  but he's just  out of the shot.  I think you can  just see his wife  and watching your face  cringe as the guy  is screaming  at the counter  it was hysterically  funny  and you got to  do more of that.  Oh thanks man.  Yeah that happens  all the time  to me in airports  and stuff.  Somebody that's  not in your world  just fucking  has a horrible  moment and you  just get to see it. 
[02:52:00]  Well the funny thing  is I just got  stranded out  in Wisconsin  last weekend  trying to get back  so I mean  and I'm thinking  about that episode  actually as I'm  standing there  trying to make  reason of why  I can't get home  but.  How long  you been flying  Eddie?  Probably a long  time right?  Oh since the  Wright brothers dude.  They invented  the bear plane  so that means  that's a long  time.  Jimmy by the  way I want  to thank you  you met my  son the last  time you were  down at the  Borgata you  treated him real  nice.  And he didn't  even bother you 
[02:52:30]  for a picture  so thanks a lot  Jimmy.  Oh you're  welcome of  course man.  And Jimmy's  going to be  back at the  Borgata right  Jimmy?  I know you're  not promoting  but the guy  mentioned you.  The first two  are sold the  third one has a  few tickets  available the  late show  Friday.  We're all  going down  there too.  That's great.  I want to  ask Louie  about the  Huckleberry  Finn thing.  What about  Huckleberry Finn?  They're taking  the n-word out  of the book.  Oh yeah there's  a whole documentary  about that that  PBS did.  What?  You could  probably get it  on PBS  website or  something.  They did a  whole documentary 
[02:53:00]  about Huck  Finn and that  nigger Jim is  the name of the  character and that  once in a while  this happened this  is a cyclical  thing it's why  everybody should  see this  documentary that  every once in a  while since the  book was written  like Mark Twain  is actually a  quote for him  where he says  I knew that  when I wrote  Huck Finn he  would cause a  lot of trouble  and that he  will throughout  history like that  every once in a  while people  someone fuck  some fucking  college student  reads it and  goes that's  that's nigger  in that  that's really a  fan thing  and starts a 
[02:53:30]  thing yes  so they there's  actually in the  documentary there's  a great moment  where Reagan is  giving a Mark  Twain the Mark  Twain award to  somebody or  something like  that and he  goes he goes  and who can  forget Huck Finn  and his great  his great friend  Jim and there's  a moment where  he looks to the  side and you  can tell there's  an aide waving 
[02:54:00]  his arms around  like he said to  him 50 times  Mr. President  when you give  this award say  Jim not but  it's nigger Jim  I read it I  haven't read much  but it's nigger  Jim  Mr. President  you can't say  nigger anymore  what why not  they don't like  it oh fine  fine  okay so  and then he was  doing practicing  for the teleprompter  and his friend  nigger Jim  Mr. President  please don't say 
[02:54:30]  nigger I'm telling  you right now it's  going to be the end  for you  oh well fine  goodness gracious  it's nigger Jim  that's the fellow's  name  and so then you  can see and he  goes and his  friend Jim  in the place of  that's great  it should say  instead when they  reprint it  um Jim  every time it's  supposed to say  nigger Jim  or they should just 
[02:55:00]  put fucking in  front of it  fucking black Jim  fucking owned by  another person face  in a different font  there's nothing more  ignorant than  thinking you're  fixing anything  thank you  by taking nigger Jim  out of Huck Finn  but it was a  fucking it's a  it's a fucking  monument to  American history  this is what  and the book is  about a kid's  struggle with 
[02:55:30]  the what if  you've read Huck Finn  which I haven't  the point of it  no I read it at  some point but  the point of it is  that this kid  Huckleberry Finn  has this friend  yeah um Jim  um Jim  who's a slave  and he's his friend  and he grew up  with him  and he wants  nigger Jim  wants him to  help him  to escape  slavery  and the kid  has been raised  that that's wrong  that nigger Jim  is a slave  and he belongs 
[02:56:00]  to somebody else  and to help him  would be stealing  would be like  corroborating with  a theft  to take away  that's what people  were raised  and he has an  internal struggle  but I know him  he's a human being  and I don't know  what to do about it  and to take away  nigger out of the  nigger Jim's name  just fucking destroy  it's like  it's like pretending  he wasn't a slave  yeah  it would be like  rewriting the story  and just saying  Jim was an employee  of the Home Depot  who wasn't paid much  and he was thinking  of getting another job  uh  but Home Depot's  really you know  their contracts 
[02:56:30]  are really strict  so Huck Finn  had to help him  go to a job  at Ikea  he was a fucking  slave who was whipped  and his name  was nigger Jim  that's how bad  his life was  so if you take  nigger out of  nigger Jim's name  you're softening  the reality  of what  life was like  then  and you're taking  away what was  great about  Mark Twain's humor  is that he reduced  the misery  of not only  black people  but of all  poor people  in the south  he took that 
[02:57:00]  context and made  colorful  beautiful  funny funny  stories  inside of that  kind of this  barefoot kid  who's fucking  starving  and he's a  dynamic  interesting character  and his friend  nigger Jim  has a voice  nobody else  was writing  for nigger Jim  it softens  the whole  conflict that  the kid is  feeling too  by  because then  it's like  oh it's just  Jim  yeah it's just  his friend  Jim  no this guy's  life is so bad  that he actually  has to say  hi my name  is nigger Jim  like he actually 
[02:57:30]  has to answer  to nigger Jim  yeah  but now it's  slave Jim  and eventually  they'll get rid  of slave  how about this  would it be  acceptable  servant or  something else  Jim the you  know what  and eventually  it'll just  how about black  Jim  like people  just say it  by people at  work  yeah yeah  just black  Jim  black guy  you know  black Jim  but who is  offended by this  because I  spent a lot of  time on Twitter  because this  niggers  I don't know 
[02:58:00]  it's usually  white people  you know what  I was on Twitter  a lot yesterday  looking at this  because it was a  trending topic  no one was offended  that was commenting  on it  black people  weren't offended  white people  weren't offended  equally people  were like why  are they doing  this  I thought it  was financial  my take was  because this  book company  is doing it  but then they're  out of touch  because I think  every time  I think that's  very shrewd  Jim  I think that  every time  they do a  new edition  of Huck Finn  they go  roll out  the fucking  nigger thing 
[02:58:30]  to get it  out on the  store  you know  to get  sell some books  and they're afraid  people might not  buy it  with nigger  and especially  the climate  now  so like  we want to  sell books  change it  like that  and maybe  schools that  aren't buying  it will buy  it  I think  it's a  financial  oh yeah  no  putting nigger  in a book  just shuts  down sales  but  I don't think  anybody gives a shit  colleges and schools  no I know  but Twitter is huge  and I'm telling you  I didn't see one  person go  well they should  take it out  they were all like  what the fuck  is this about  who's talking  about taking it  out now  the publisher  the publisher 
[02:59:00]  the new south  without really  giving a reason  I haven't seen  a reason yet  why they're  taking it out  they said  it was actually  based on one guy  complaining and  talking about it  that whenever he  had to talk  about the book  he did the  um Jim  how fucking  important is that  and you should  say nigger Jim  when you talk  about the book  if you're talking  to 6th graders  about it  you should say  nigger Jim  every time  you should never  say Jim  without nigger  in life  in any context  sports 
[02:59:30]  nigger Jim  on this show  in the morning  when I say  hi in the morning  Bobby Anthony  with nigger Jim  yeah that's  that's your new name  Jim  nigger Jimmy  Norton  little nigger  Jimmy Norton  oh my god  oh Jesus Lou  you gotta show  an effect  you're gonna get  an effect  no but you shouldn't  that's how  that's how you  if you untie  those two  you're doing  a real fucking  damage  yeah that's  I agree  it is softening  completely  and they'll  continue softening  they won't  stop by 
[03:00:00]  uh uh  uh  with just  naming them  slave Jim  no  they'll move  on from there  hey uh  a quote from  Mark Twain  about censorship  censorship is  telling a man  he can't have  a steak  just because  a baby  can't chew  it  that's very  very Mark  Twainy of him  that is  can you find  Mark Twain  about Huck  Finn  cause he said  find Mark Twain  talking about Huck Finn  yeah I wanna  I would love to know  if actually  if you google  also youtube around  and see if you can  find that Ron Reagan  clip cause I swear  to god  it's what I  you know  it always ends up  being something  I didn't know  what a great quote 
[03:00:30]  what a fucking  censorship is  telling a man  he can't have  steak because  a baby  can't chew it  that is fucking  genius  we uh  sacrifice  and said this  years ago  our own  our own  entertainment  because we gotta  protect the children  yeah the children  but I think also  what about our  entertainment  a baby is also  about  other adults  metaphorically as well  that's definitely  used as a  metaphor  absolutely  for asshole  children 
[03:01:00]  I never read  that  I don't read  Mark Twain  I've never read  him  oh Jimmy  uh  I'm just not  neither do I  that's a great quote  that stopped me  in my tracks  and I'm hard to do  is everybody says  no one doesn't  stop in their tracks  like Norton  that's what the  word on the street  is  people who think  other people  have different  impressions of them  than they do  everybody's like  people always know  I don't fuck around  nobody knows  that  nobody knows  and in other news  it's official  according to  CSA  Dick 
[03:01:30]  the Cleveland  Cavaliers have  offered that  homeless guy  the job of  announcing  announcing  that the  fucking  Cleveland  Cavaliers  Cleveland  needs something  that guy  is going to  have a really  good job  see he turns it  down because he  doesn't want to  live in Cleveland  right  he or maybe  wants to go  somewhere warmer  well that too  Chip  just ruined your  brilliant joke  oh fuck him  yeah well  what are we doing  we're looking up the  clip  that's going to be a 
[03:02:00]  hard thing to find  I'm going to  it was a PBS  documentary  I'm going to  watch that today  can I watch it on  YouTube  Netflix  it's kind of  difficult to find  actually  how about Netflix  later I will  I gotta look  when I did a  preliminary search  it wasn't really  yielding a lot  besides VHS types  what's that  what's the special  called the documentary  I don't fucking  remember  I'll get it for you  hang on  someone can help me  out and let me  know  that's alright  sometimes we snap  I don't  it is called  Culture Shock  Born to Trouble  Adventures of  Huck Finn 
[03:02:30]  that's the name of it  but it's kind of hard  to find  it's 10 years old  already  right  I'll see  so  I'm surprised  YouTube doesn't have  it  it might be on there  but not under that  title anyway  is it on Netflix  Dan  I need to look  for it  because  please  let me say  hi to Jerry  in Maine  Jerry  hey boys  how are you  pretty good  buddy  alright  Louie  it's a great  show  and 
[03:03:00]  you know what  hold on one second  we will go back  to you in a sec  Kyle in California  is a black guy  very angry  Kyle what's up  hey  good morning guys  good morning  how you doing  I'm Kyle  he's laughing  what's up Kyle  I just want  I want to say  I love the show  right  but  you guys  like Patrice  if Patrice was there  you guys would use  like your fucking  nigga quota  this morning  like this shit 
[03:03:30]  is ridiculous  Louie  I love your show too  my wife and I  watch it all the time  genius but  who made the point  saying that  to take out the word  nigga Jim  out of  that takes away  from the story  I didn't catch you  but that  no it's not  it would take away  from well it would  take away from the story  but it also take  it would take away  the historical context  of it  it would take  it would be sanitizing  Kyle let him finish  he makes a good point  it would be sanitizing  history in a way  that in the end 
[03:04:00]  that in the end is bad  for black people  I think  he was a slave  yeah I know  so how does  take in the word  that  highly offensive word  mind you  because he wasn't  just a slave  he was called  nigger Jim  everything about his life  horrid it was  it takes away  from the horror  of what this guy's  life was  and also  Kyle  let me ask you  something  when you read  something  when you read  something  you should be hit  with a visceral  reaction  like slave Jim  it's a horrible  thing to be a slave 
[03:04:30]  that doesn't give you  a visceral reaction  when you read  no no no Jim  if you knew  anything about  what slavery  was really  entailed  it doesn't matter  what you call  you have one minute  left on your phone card  you have one minute  left on your phone card  Kyle  let me ask you  a question  let me ask you  a question  because we've said  what we think about it  if you want to add  something  what would be  accomplished  by taking  nigger Jim  out of the book  I think 
[03:05:00]  the fact  and I agree  with you on  censorship  it's diluting  our society  and that quote  that he had  saying  if you take  away from a man  it's like  you're stopping  a baby  Kyle  what would be  accomplished  did you take him off  what would be  accomplished  what positive  would come out  of taking  nigger Jim  out of a book  like Huck Finn  the positive  that I feel  would be accomplished  it would set  a standard 
[03:05:30]  as far as  what  acceptable  in our society  and I  I agree with you  as far as censorship  but  it's not about  censorship  it's about  telling  somebody said  it was part  of a great  part of  American history  right  that book  stems from a  great part of  American history  it's part of  American history  that was a  very dark  and disgusting  time in our  history  so should we  so should we  believe it didn't  happen  should we go back  and change  what it was  really like  is that  I mean is that 
[03:06:00]  even fucking  you know  I don't think  it should be  celebrated  Kyle should we  go back and  read  should we  re-dub  it's not being  celebrated  it's being  illumi  motherfucking  nated  grow the  fuck up  man  should roots  be edited  a certain way  should we  re-dub  Schindler's list  and everywhere  that they say  Juden  say respectfully  Jews  no problem  with them  but let's go  ahead and kill  them  but let's not  go and call  them Juden  I knew you  would bring  that point  up  as far as  how the  Jews were 
[03:06:30]  treated  even the  Japanese  in World War  II  was  called  them  jinx  and whatever  you call  them  flat faces  who knows  I understand  your  should roots  be redone  with the word  nigger removed  no  why  because  that  I'm nailed  you got  me  thank you  Kyle  seriously  that takes  balls to  admit you're  wrong  yeah no one  does that  I'm done  you're right  all right  thank you  Kyle  let me get  your fucking 
[03:07:00]  shine box  thank you  that's wonderful  yes  hello  you think  Frank Vincent  quotes  listen he said  it we didn't  say it  just a question  because it goes  back to the  9-11 stuff  and all  you think  slavery was  bad for  everybody  that was  a slave  oh that was  a slave  that was a slave  do you think  like one guy  was kind of  cool  I'm just  asking the  question  you think  there was  some slaves  that went  holy fuck  there's a  pretty good  damn life  it was  no  because you 
[03:07:30]  just  you can't  choose it  you can't  make a choice  that's  essential to  human happiness  some guys  had better  experiences  the ones  that worked  in the house  some people  found happiness  inside of  lives  I was happy  that slavery  slavery  was abolished  you would  still  be the  burned  I had  it  actually  pretty  easy  doing  what I  was  doing  and now  when I  learned  American  history  back when I  was in  junior high  school  because that's  as far as  my education  really got  I was in  high school  but I didn't  learn anything  there  life got 
[03:08:00]  very suddenly  difficult  for people  after they  were freed  their life  some of  them  their lives  were simpler  and then  some of  them  their lives  got more  difficult  but I  think if  you would  ask them  they would  have said  life is  hard now  but I'd  rather  that than  be a  slave  I would  say most  people  are you  always  going to  have  some  that  will  take  that  other  side  of  life  was  easier  than  I can 
[03:08:30]  think  that  about  a lot  of  times  in my  life  that  were  worse  but  easier  there  are  people  in  prison  that  don't  want  to  ever  get  out  of  prison  so  also  by the  way  those  people  the  slaves  that  were  freed  took  a  hit  for  the  rest  of  the  for  every  generation  after  them  they  had  the  hardest  job  which  was  to  transition  to  a  free  life  and  they  had  they  suffered  for  it  because  nobody  because  suddenly  they're  just  they  go  from  being  slaves  somebody  who  at least  the  whites  would  protect  them  just  because  they're  their  property  just 
[03:09:00]  based  on  you  know  you  know  with  the  same  protection  of  like  stay  off  my  lawn  stop  hitting  my  slave  and  then  suddenly  they  become  just  their  neighbor  who  they  hate  right  and  who  they'll  do  anything  who  they  just  because  they're  so bored  of being  poor  that they  just  take  it  out  on  black  people  so  yeah  I  think  that  it  was  probably  black  people  that  were  bitter  I'm  talking  totally  out  of  my  ass  it's  not  my  experience  but  I'm  speculating  if I was  to speculate  I was  to say  there are  people  like  I  think  I  shouldn't  have  been  freed 
[03:09:30]  I  would  have  been  left  with  white  people  really  stink  because  first  they  fucking  capture  you  own  you  and  then  they  let  you  go  and  beat  the  shit  out  of  you  until  you  die  I  really  am  not  fond  of  whites  that  would  have  been  my  prevailing  feeling  for  anybody  at that  time  not  freedom  stinks  but  white  people  aren't  fun  in  any  capacity  not  being  fun  and  nice  no  they're  not  being  fun  and  nice  I  think  if  slaves  were  kind  of  given  some  that  guy's 
[03:10:00]  not  really  nice  it's  like  this  there's  a  Gary  Larson  cartoon  of  hell  and  there's  two  guys  sitting  in  the  corner  of  hell  waiting  to  get  tortured  and  it's  not  for  me  I'm  not  into  this  so  I  suppose  there's  black  people  that  were  like  that  yeah  I  think  it's  put  a  terrible  burden  on  the  country  in  many  many 
[03:10:30]  ways  over  many  many  years  you  know  Kyle's  call  though  is  he's  a  black  guy  he's  fucking  doesn't  like  the  word  nigger  fair  enough  but  it's  like  that  reaction  that  initial  that  anger  about  it  it's  like  when  you  break  it  down  logically  it  shouldn't  be  taken  out  to  be  pleasant  or  to  be  polite  you  can't  change  something  that  makes  you  realize  how  horrible  something  you  should  read  that  and  feel  unpleasant  about  it  also  it's  what  he  wrote  it's  what  he 
[03:11:00]  wrote  it's  what  he  wrote  it's  a  insight  into  his  mind  even  if  he  wrote  it  for  nefarious  reason  it's  what  he  wrote  either  don't  print  the  book  or  print  it  or  don't  buy  it  for  schools  if  you  don't  think  you  read  another  book  read  a  Harry  book  birth of a  nation  it's  funny  though  people  are  so  excited  to get  offended  and  clacking  on the  keyboard  and make  that  phone  call  that  they  don't  think  about 
[03:11:30]  it  they  don't  think  about  it  and  you  give  him  one  simple  argument  what  should  you  take  it  out of  roots  no  but  oh  yeah  that's  right  why  why  should  oh  yeah  that's  why  my  nickname  is  the  slippery  slope  kid  I  really  had to  bring  up  slippery  slopes  and  that's  why  that's  why  you  gotta  fight  it  because  then  you  start  here  they  just  continue  and  they  edit  everything  every  movie  we know  every  book  we 
[03:12:00]  know  history  in general  they  would love  to edit  you  can't  edit  unpleasant  things  they  are  there  don't  watch  them  or  don't  read  them  I  mean  it's  why  I  wear  a  shirt  that  says  hey  the knob  has  an on  off  switch  this  guy  has  got  some  insight  on  the  guy  that's  doing  this  Daniel  in  Oklahoma  you  know  a little  more  than  we  do  hopefully  yeah  welcome  aboard  Dan  thanks  Jim  I  read  an  interview  with  the  guy  and  it's  just  one  guy  this  was  not  a  publisher's 
[03:12:30]  decision  it  wasn't  like  a  board  of  people  who  decided  to  do  it  it  was  one  guy  he's  a  Mark  Twain  scholar  I  guess  as  much  as  you  could  be  right  and  he  goes  around  and  he  does  presentations  and tools  about the  book  and he  found  that a lot  of  teachers  are afraid  to assign  the book  as reading  because of  that word  so what he  did  he rewrote  the book  because it's  like  what a  public  domain  but he  can  publish  it  and  the  beginning  of the  book  there's  a  several  page  forward  that  explains  that  this  has  been  censored  and  it  basically  says  anytime  nigger  I'm 
[03:13:00]  going to  put  slave  you  basically  know  that  up  front  so  that  teachers  can  assign  the  book  and  kids  can  learn  it  and  want  it  and  it's  a  fucking  shame  because  kids  should  know  it's  not a  conspiracy  and  it's  not  he  doesn't  feel  guilty  about  it  I  believe  it  is  no  it  isn't  a  conspiracy  it's  just  a  bad  decision  and  it  has  an  impact  because  kids  that  are  going  to  read  the  book  aren't  going  to  know  what  history  was  like  they're  not  going  to  know  how  bad  things  were  they're 
[03:13:30]  also  not  going  to  know  how  the  story  were  they're  not  going  to  understand  the  irony  almost  the  dichotomy  or other  words  I don't  know  exactly  what  they  mean  of  this  kid  having  a  friend  who  he  calls  nigger  Jim  and  he  has  affection  for  him  and  actually  is  thinking  about  turning  him  in  he's  actually  thinking  well  if  you  know  I  mean  I  was  taught  my  the  golden  rule  turn  niggers  in  when  they  run  away  like  that's  what  it  was  to  grow  up  in  that  time 
[03:14:00]  come  on  nigger  Jim  you're  my  pal  what  a  crazy  sentence  that  is  leave  it  the  fuck  alone  let  kids  deal  with  that  not  only  the  reality  of how  hard  things  were  for  black  book  well  enough  to  come  up  with  but  there's  probably  some  you know  like  there was  a movie  about  Hitler  that came  out a few  years ago  with John  Cusack  where he  knows  he's a  friend  of young  Hitler  when he  was an  artist  and he 
[03:14:30]  says to  him  at one  point  Hitler  let me  buy you  a  lemonade  that's  a quote  from the  movie  Hitler  let me  buy you  a  lemonade  what a  crazy  thing  but it's  a valuable  thing  for people  to know  that Hitler  was once  some art  student  and bought  him a  lemonade  to cheer  him up  did he  drink it  did he  accept  the  lemonade  he  accepted  the  lemonade  and said  I'm  going to  kill  every  kid  did he  see the  lemonade  and go  wow  this would  make  great 
[03:15:00]  die  for  numbers  he  started  the ball  rolling  I didn't  hear you  sir  we talked  over you  I apologize  I was  trying to  do a  chip  I'm  sorry  you're  gone  thank  you  I  actually  didn't  hear  that  one  you like  that your  kids go  to public  schools  yeah  I do  I think  public  schools  are they  learning  proper  things  you think  no  but  they're  they got  you know  it's good 
[03:15:30]  they're getting  a bad  education  to get  no  we have  a particularly  good public  school  in our  neighborhood  because we  have  wealthier  people  in our  neighborhood  but you've  seen that  PC shit  though  what's that  the PC  shit  no  no  it's a  Merry Christmas  at that  school  still  I can't  remember  if  Christmas  we had  Christmas  stuff up  I don't  know  I don't  care about  that  I don't  believe  that that's  the fucking  battleground  the happy  holidays  Bill O'Reilly  who gives a  shit  there's no  well you're 
[03:16:00]  defending Santa Claus  and Jesus  you're a pinhead  then  yeah  apparently I'm a pinhead  you're a pinhead  and not a patriot  I don't think it makes  any difference  that's cheesy  when they say  Merry Christmas  in school  it's just as cheesy  as when they say  happy holidays  to all  everyone  I don't care  but the  kids education  education is  I think it's  really a huge  part of why  America grew  well even though  it's now dying  poorly  a horrible death  that people would  all throw into  this one school  and wherever you  live that's where 
[03:16:30]  you went  you know  and that it was  paid for  by a collective  and kids  in your neighborhood  and teachers  in your neighborhood  all interacted  rather than this  idea that  your select  a school  is being paid  for  and selecting  children  you get all  these things  like fake  diversity  in private  schools  where private  schools  brag that they  have a certain  amount of  you know  just enough  black people  just enough  diversity  yeah  to not  to say  we're diverse  to make everyone  comfortable  yeah  but public  schools are just  very ad hoc 
[03:17:00]  they're very imperfect  and they're good  what's ad hoc mean  ad hoc means  kind of put together  without a plan  I think  yeah  it's like an ad hoc  sounds right  yeah  there's lump  you know  layers of lumpy paint  there's not really  you know  and you can't  get the shit beat  out of you  by the diverse crowd  in public school  yeah  yeah  and you do your  you just do your best  in a public school  and it's got the depth  that you can go  and you know  if you're a kid  that's really curious  you can learn  otherwise  you might be ignored  it's sort of up to you  learn more about  like real life  and how to function  in society  but it's terrible 
[03:17:30]  that there are places  where there is no good  public school  I mean there's  neighborhoods in America  where there is no  accredited school  where literally  there is no school  yeah  there's a lot  like in Lowell Mass  I think my friend of mine  is a doctor  and he bought a mansion  in Lawrence, Massachusetts  okay  because it cost him $15  and he started living there  and opened a clinic  and then he learned  that there was no school  literally  the public schools  were so bad  that they lost accreditation  that if you  if you graduated  from the local school  you couldn't go to college  it didn't matter 
[03:18:00]  you just went  no totally  because they didn't have  enough money  to keep the schools going  there was no private school  so literally  those kids were just  that weren't  growing up illiterate  wow  that's fucked up  and it should be  I think fixed  through public school  I don't believe  in all this charter shit  and private school vouchers  I don't personally believe  that's just my belief though  I went to a great  school tax  I know that  and I don't have no kids  what's that  I ain't got no kids  but I pay a lot of school tax  yes you do  yeah  so enjoy your education 
[03:18:30]  kids  it's so  I guess it's so  you know  they're not throwing shit  at my house  that's all it is  yeah  it's keeping the dirty folks  in this building  keep the nice schools  because if you have nice schools  then it keeps nice people  in your neighborhood  so it's pretty much  I'm paying extortion  money  to keep the bad people  out of my neighborhood  they get you coming  and going at  right  how many times  have we said that  right in the pocketbook  they get you right  in the pocketbook Jim  running out of show  one more phone call  for Louis C.K.  because it's a good one  Melissa  what do you got for Louis  oh you saved the best  for last 
[03:19:00]  good morning gentlemen  good morning  hi Melissa  why are you laughing at  I have been married  for 10 years  and just recently  I started really  changing my viewpoint  on that  and listening to the show  has been a big help  and Louis in particular  have really  led me in the right direction  so I just wanted  to thank you  so do what  divorce  you got out of  a bad marriage  just trying not to say  what she's  yeah  okay  good  because of Louis C.K. 
[03:19:30]  pretty much  more or less  yeah  there you go  you're helping people  well what was wrong  with the marriage  that you had to get out of this  it just wasn't working  I don't want to get  too specific  do you have kids  vague  keep it vague  do you have kids  that's what I do  but yeah  it's  you have kids  no  and that  oh so you know  fucking cares  exactly  who cares  did he ever hit you  did he ever hit you  was it physically abusive  no  what do you do wrong 
[03:20:00]  what are you the Kramer  versus Kramer lawyer  did he hit you at all  was he an alcoholic  did he blow his money  did he  well then I can see  why you left him  next witness  I don't want to put  blame on me  you want the kid  don't you  what makes a woman  a better parent  simply by virtue  of her sex  infidelity  virtue of a sex  infidelity  that was good  no  marriages  sometimes they just stink  every fucking day stinks 
[03:20:30]  and then you stop talking about it  because it's so bad  that the only  you can't communicate  because the only communication  would be  honey I'm not feeling  so good about us  I know because  every day sucks  and we should split up  that's a hard thing  to say out loud  but there's nothing  you know it's natural  why should things  nothing is going to  just keep going  except for Opie's marriage  other than that  there's  it really is a happy marriage  I really think marriages  should be finite  I really think they should  you should sign like a  five year ten year contract  oh yeah  you should be 
[03:21:00]  getting married  well that's like  when you  if you were to like  do a ten year  five year  I love you  I want to marry you  for ten years  and then around nine years  you start talking about  do you want to keep doing this  renegotiate  you want to re-up  well  then you could say  I'm not  here's why I'm not crazy  about re-upping  you could actually say it  if you're nine years deep  into a forever relationship  you can't even talk about  the problems  because there's so much at stake  but if you were  at year nine  you'd be like  okay here's what I hate about you 
[03:21:30]  if you could change  forty percent of these  I would hang in for another  two years  ten five years  and then the other person goes  I don't want to change this  I don't want to change this  what a brilliant idea  well because we're talking  about changing marriage  to be civil unions anyway  to be  a civil union by the way  is a prenuptial agreement  that's what it is  a prenuptial agreement  is a civil union  it's a court based  and thank God for those  civil  so you write those out  no wonder he left you  and then every marriage  will become  I know  every marriage will become 
[03:22:00]  exactly  the men are talking  why don't you go grab  some coffee  for the boys  we're going to make some cookies  I want to smell cookie dough  wafting out of the kitchen  and you can waddle around  your apron  while the men talk  and fucking  drag your cunt  into the fucking kitchen  no listen  I'm glad you got out of there  it's not  I'm only kidding madam  there's a lot of  there's a lot of pressure  on married people  to stay together  by people that have  no stake in it  yeah  you gotta hang in there  you don't live in my 
[03:22:30]  fucking house  you know  you don't know the misery  no and if you don't have kids  I don't even care  I mean if you don't have kids  you just broke up  with your boyfriend  you're dating  right  yeah who gives a fuck  it's meaningless  there's no  you just  it does become different  when you become a father  yeah that's shit  totally different  well in any event  thank you  sure  bye Melissa  good luck to you  with that we gotta thank  Louis CK  it was great catching up  with Louis man  always  thank you fellas  he's really famous  yes he is  very famous now  oh my god  no it's  and it's a white house 
[03:23:00]  I'll tell you what  that's what  you know when I tweeted  the Sarah Palin cunt tweets  the thought I had up there  in the sky was  I'll never  I've put a glass ceiling  on my career  I just put a glass ceiling  you'll never be the guy  at the White House  I will never be  at the White House  correspondence  like that's the  that's like the heavyweight champion  that's what every great comic  gets to eventually  is roasting the president  yeah  and in the White House  and somebody will vet me  for that at some point  just cause I'm one of the  you know I'm on 
[03:23:30]  I'm on a list  a short list of comedians  in the world  I don't know how short  the list is  at least 20 or so  and if you  who are alive and working  and if you take down  that list  you get to my name  click Google  nah  let's not invite  that problem  that's gonna be a problem  Sarah Palin's  retard making cunt  I don't think we want  that's gonna be a problem  to clear this one  to give the  you know  Chris or whatever  the fucking people  at Fox News are  yeah we don't want  Barack Obama 
[03:24:00]  apparently thought  it would be funny  to have this guy  who said  that Sarah Palin's  son was a retard  now if a Republican  comic had said  something like that  they'd have hung him  out to dry  they really would have  done a number  on that one  I do love the hypocrisy  there  fuck it Louie  you rule  alright  what do we gotta do  we gotta make sure  people see Hilarious  it's gonna be on  Comedy Central  Sunday night at 10pm  and then the DVD
