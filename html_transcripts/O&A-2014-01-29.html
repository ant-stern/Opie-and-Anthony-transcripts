<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts mocking Atlanta's overreaction to a minor snowfall, calling the residents "retarded" for their unpreparedness. They then transitioned to criticizing CNN weatherman Chad Myers' exaggeration of weather reports and a rumored incident involving Weather Channel's Jim Cantore kneing a man in the groin.  Their own "storm trooping" experience during Superstorm Sandy was recounted.

The conversation shifted to the State of the Union address, with the hosts harshly criticizing President Obama's speech as pandering and filled with "bullshit," specifically targeting his "if you like your health care plan, you can keep it" statement and his informal greetings to audience members.  Anthony voiced frustration over his cancelled healthcare plan.  The hosts’ commentary became increasingly sexist and misogynistic during a debate on equal pay for women.  They also covered Congressman Michael Grimm's threat to a New York One reporter and expressed disappointment with the Super Bowl festivities in New York City, describing it as a "bust."  A caller, Chris, provided a behind-the-scenes perspective on the Super Bowl's logistical chaos.  The hosts then sampled Super Bowl food sent to the studio, interspersed with more misogynistic jokes. Bobo's date with News 12 Long Island reporter Tara McDonald was discussed, along with speculation about their encounter.  Further criticism of the State of the Union's perceived hypocrisy and political maneuvering followed.  The show also covered a masturbation incident on Metro North, a teen's survival of a skydiving accident, an opera singer's post-surgery flatulence, segments of "My 600-lb Life," and Motley Crue's purported final tour, with the hosts expressing skepticism. A new intern, Angelica, was introduced.

A subsequent segment focused on a sampling of chocolates sent to the show, with humorous descriptions of the different varieties.  A lengthy letter from Munson's chocolate company was read. The hosts then launched into a critical discussion of Macklemore's Grammy performance and public persona, using clips from an Ellen DeGeneres interview.  They expressed strong dislike for Macklemore, criticizing his perceived phoniness and self-promotion, including his on-stage weddings and apologies for being white and winning awards, using offensive language and personal attacks.  The discussion then shifted to the Owen Hart wrestling accident, including a listener's firsthand account and explicit details of the event and its aftermath, particularly focusing on Vince McMahon’s decision to continue the show. This segment concluded with tense exchanges between the hosts, referencing Jim Norton's tardiness and apparent intoxication.

A segment featuring Jim Florentine as a guest focused on the Super Bowl, including ticket sales, the lack of tailgating, and perceived referee bias favoring Peyton Manning. Florentine discussed his dietary habits, avoiding desserts.  The hosts and Florentine debated Motley Crue's "retirement," Black Sabbath's Grammy performance, and the Super Bowl's atmosphere.  They criticized Super Bowl commercials, particularly Peyton Manning's Papa John's commercials, and predicted a lackluster halftime show.  They discussed NFL bias and refereeing, with a caller challenging their theory. Roland's restrictive diet was also a recurring topic.  Other topics included a man masturbating publicly after a car accident, Florentine's tour dates, his past musical tastes (including the "safety dance"), and promotion of Foodie Direct.  Super Bowl food was sampled during this segment.

Another segment focused on Jim Florentine's vehement dislike of fantasy football, repeatedly calling it "gay" and "nerdy."  The hosts and callers discussed the absurdity of the league's structure, drawing comparisons to gambling and featuring mocking impressions of Mike Francesa.  Callers shared their own experiences, reinforcing Florentine's negative view. The physical toll of professional football, particularly concussions, was discussed, along with excessive team loyalty displays.  The segment included off-color anecdotes, including the train masturbation incident and the opera singer's incontinence.  Mike Francesa called in and did a comedic impression of himself. Florentine's podcasts and stand-up appearances were promoted.

The final segment covered a lawsuit filed by opera singer Amy Hurt for $2.5 million due to allegedly botched surgery resulting in excessive flatulence, impacting her singing career.  The hosts joked about the lawsuit and briefly mentioned the absence of show staffer Bill Schultz.  They also covered a Texas teenager's survival of a skydiving accident.  A phone call with Grammy winner Paul Williams was attempted, but connection issues repeatedly interrupted the conversation, leading to humorous frustration.  Williams briefly discussed his win, his book on recovery, and his work with ASCAP before the call ended abruptly again. The show concluded with promotional announcements for stand-up comedy shows and a podcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my goodness.  I want to say a special good morning to Atlanta.  Poor Atlanta.  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  You're going to have a very hard time dealing with the snow.  We got the exact same snowfall as Atlanta overnight.  About two inches-ish.  About two inches, a dusting to two. 
[00:00:30]  And how long did it take you to get in today?  It was a little longer by maybe five minutes.  Five minutes.  Not too bad.  Well, there are people still camped out in their cars in Atlanta because it snowed two inches.  Stranded.  That always boggles my mind.  Yeah.  And you can't...  I would love to think that, you know, people that live in Atlanta are just fucking retarded or something.  But you've got to look past that.  So what is it?  And I guess it is, they're just not prepared for snow removal down there.  Not prepared at all.  They don't have, like, the salt spreaders and the plows really ready to go. 
[00:01:00]  And then I think it's also just, you know, no matter how badly people drive around here,  and especially in the snow, they do know, for the most part, how to drive in snow.  Yeah.  If you don't know, you just lose your mind.  You step on the gas and your wheels go...  And you're like...  But how do you not know?  I know they don't deal with it, but, I mean, you've got to imagine there's a lot of people  that moved to Atlanta that came from colder climates as well. 
[00:01:30]  It probably only takes a few people, though, on the road to really fuck things up.  They were talking about people left work early, and they ended up in their cars for 10, 12 hours.  They ran out of gas.  There's a few people that had to sleep in their cars, all because of two inches of snow.  Yeah.  When did it snow there in?  Yesterday.  This is a weird deep freeze thing that's happening in the south.  South.  And they also had kids, like, stranded at their schools.  Right.  Just the buses couldn't get them.  Well, because they didn't cancel school in time, so the parents left work early to go get their kids, 
[00:02:00]  and that was the issue.  They got stranded, so some of the students had to spend the night in the school.  Right.  Two inches?  That would have been a good adventure, though.  Two inches.  Yeah, that's just it.  Two fucking inches.  Pretty much a basic little snowstorm.  Nothing else really involved with it.  Yeah.  And then Chad blew it.  Chad!  Chad!  Well, he's based right down there, right?  Well, I'm obsessed with Chad like the rest of us.  Who doesn't love Chad?  He's a goofball, and he pops up on that CNN all the time with his weather. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And yesterday, they had him in New Orleans.  They thought, that would be a great shot, you know?  Yeah.  Bourbon Street with snow.  Sure.  And he was trying to work it, but it turned out it was like icy rain is all he really got.  At that time, I don't know what happened.  Did he lie again?  After his report.  Did he lie again?  Yeah, he was pumping it up.  It's up to my knees.  It's like, we see you, Chad.  It's up to your fucking ankles if that.  Relax, Chad.  Yeah.  Just relax a little bit. 
[00:03:00]  And then who's that Cantor?  That Cantor-y guy from the Weather Channel?  Did he tackle somebody?  No, some guy.  He was at some college, and he's talking about the weather and how cold it is and everything.  And some guy came running over at him like, woo!  And he turned to the side.  Right.  Put his knee up right into the guy's fucking balls.  And then just turned around, and without missing a beat.  And just continued.  Continued his shit as the guy ran off, kind of, you can tell, a little worse for wear.  Me and Jimmy were hanging out with him a little bit down at Battery Park when Superstorm Sandy was rolling in. 
[00:03:30]  Is he like a man's man?  Yeah, he tries to act like he's a man's man.  He's a man's man.  Jim Cantor.  He's all right.  I mean, he does a good job for the Weather Channel.  You were a little scar-struck when we saw him.  I didn't know who he was.  He was a star.  He's the star of the Weather Channel.  That guy's fucking big.  If he's down here, this is a big deal.  That guy's been in all the storms.  Well, we nailed the spot.  I was more excited about my storm chasing.  What did we call it?  I was trying to remember as I was saying that.  It was storm chasing?  No, no. 
[00:04:00]  These guys would know.  Fuck.  We were goofballs about it.  Storm watching?  No, I think we were saying storm differently.  Trooping.  Storm trooping, right?  Storm trooping, we said.  Ooh.  When we were storm trooping, we nailed the spot that Cantone picked as well.  So I think I was more excited about that.  I mean, that guy in the fucking jet ski out in the Hudson.  That was kind of cool.  And everyone's like, I can't believe he's doing this.  You know, hurricanes roll in really slowly.  And if you're one of these jet ski guys, you're going to take advantage of those big waves 
[00:04:30]  and have plenty of time to get back to where you need to go.  And the reporters know that, but they have to play it up for, I guess, their viewers.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This isn't a safe practice.  Right, exactly.  All that shit has to go down.  Nobody down here can handle the ice.  So Memphis checking in, they're saying they're fucked up, too.  Ice, yeah.  The ice is probably a big problem.  I guess it has to do more with the snow removal than anything.  If you don't have sand and salt. 
[00:05:00]  The roads are absolutely ridiculous, right?  No matter if it's a foot or two inches.  Yeah.  But I was doing a little research, a little research.  And the Southeast, very often through history, has gotten these freezes.  Really?  And everybody likes, well, climate change, blah, blah, blah.  But it's happened plenty of times from, like, when they've been keeping records in the 1800s.  They had these freezes that would just eliminate the orange drop. 
[00:05:30]  I was going to say, what about the oranges?  Oh, the price of OJ is going to go up.  Why does it take one stupid tiny little frost and we have to pay more for orange juice?  And how much more?  Just an excuse to raise the prices, right?  It's not like, oh, my God, now it's $60 a carton.  Right.  They're still making the orange juice.  Yeah.  Where did it come from?  Right.  Right.  If you had a deep freeze, wouldn't that mean there's no orange juice?  You'd think.  Not more expensive orange juice? 
[00:06:00]  Just more expensive.  Why?  They have to defrost all the oranges before they fucking make orange juice?  Yes, that's it.  So dumb.  Just put it in a Nutribullet.  Oh, shit.  Did I just say that?  You didn't.  Right now, Roland's going, eee.  So that's, I guess, a big story.  See, look at there.  Yeah.  A dangerous wintry mix slams the southeast, bringing several states to a standstill.  From Georgia to Louisiana, an early exodus of commuters trying to beat the storm home found 
[00:06:30]  themselves stuck in horrific gridlock on countless interstates.  I about slid into the side rail myself.  You know, once I started sliding, I couldn't control it.  This far-reaching storm causing havoc from southeast Texas to the Gulf Coast, up through the Carolinas  and southeast Virginia, with statewide emergencies in full effect.  In Alabama, at least five people died in weather-related wrecks.  Hundreds of National Guard members have been called to help. 
[00:07:00]  This is a very dangerous situation.  People need to stay at home.  Conditions were so bad in Alabama that thousands of students have been stranded, forced to spend  the night at school.  I want to reassure all the parents that if you trust your teacher to take care of your child  during the day, they will be taken care of tonight.  Yeah, you look out for them.  It was hauled into Charleston, South Carolina, where crews braced for conditions they don't 
[00:07:30]  usually see here.  Yeah.  More crews are on standby.  All right, so.  Yeah, they're going great.  I think Atlanta, Travis was telling me, what, over 900 confirmed accidents in Atlanta alone?  Yeah, like 940.  940.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah, just in Atlanta.  Just in Atlanta alone, 940 confirmed accidents.  But how will this affect Freaknik?  Oh, boy.  Do they even do Freaknik down there still?  I don't think they have to call it something different now.  Yeah, well, you can't call it Freaknik.  That's a little.  No, no.  That says a lot.  Freaknik.  That was one of the most amazing things we've ever seen in our lives. 
[00:08:00]  We just wanted to get from the airport to our hotel.  Oh, my God.  And we were trapped in the middle of Freaknik, where they were stopping cars and dancing on  the top of their cars.  Twerking.  Yeah, twerking before anyone knew what twerking was.  Right.  I just used to call it that ass dance.  Right.  It's like they're doing the ass dance on top of the cars.  Oh, my God.  Right.  That was cray-cray.  You do understand the LP Anthony show is very popular in Atlanta.  Atlanta was there, yeah.  You were just there.  Yeah.  So you just missed this shit. 
[00:08:30]  I just missed it by about two days.  And they were really, really very hardcore fans.  We almost worked down there.  Oh, we certainly almost did.  I mean, if we didn't have two offers in New York City, we would have worked in Atlanta.  Yeah, slow down.  I'd have been living in Buckhead.  So we took advantage of their steak dinners and everything, knowing we were never going  to go to Atlanta.  Compound South and Buckhead.  Buckhead.  Buckhead's just like New York.  Just like New York.  Is it?  I like those guys.  They were cool.  They wined and dined us, but it didn't work out. 
[00:09:00]  Didn't work out.  Put us in the Ritz-Carlton, my God.  Oh, it was wonderful.  I remember watching a ridiculous, like, just lightning storm, whatever the fuck you call  them, from the top of the Ritz-Carlton.  Yeah.  God damn, this is kind of cold down here.  It was.  Big, huge fucking windows.  And the call came from New York City, and we couldn't fucking get out of Atlanta quick  enough.  The big selling points for Atlanta were lightning and windows. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, perhaps.  Well, their whole angle was, it's just like New York.  Right.  So as soon as they said that, I was really taking a very close look, and, man, I just  didn't see New York.  No, it's not at all like New York.  No, man.  It was very redneck-y.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  It's just...  That's what you're into.  Yeah.  You should have said it was very redneck-y, and you guys could figure this out eventually.  Yeah.  And then, I don't know, they were so convinced we were going to sign down there that, remember  one day, we were down there like three days, and one of the days, they took us around with 
[00:10:00]  a real estate agent.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh, God, that was the worst move they could have made.  To show us what we could get for our money or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they're showing us like a celebrity and CEO's houses and how we'd be living in  those neighborhoods.  And then we're in open houses.  I'm like, what are we doing?  What the fuck are we doing?  What the fuck?  You don't show someone a good time by taking them around with a realtor.  Right.  That's like not fun.  Oh, God. 
[00:10:30]  So, hang in there, Atlanta.  Suffice to say, we didn't take the offer.  No.  No, we did not.  No.  Your boy Obama did well last night.  My what?  My what?  Yeah, yeah.  It was...  Sounds like interesting.  Sounds like we're about to get a really cool country.  Yeah, nothing.  Everything sounds great.  He's finally going to start doing something that people like and it is good for the country.  I'm excited.  Oh, who is it? 
[00:11:00]  I'm excited by the possibilities.  He laid out the whole plan.  This country is going to be amazing.  Not even the possibilities.  What has been accomplished already?  It sounds like we're living in just an amazing place.  Right.  There's so many jobs pouring in.  The economy is great.  Yep.  There's this...  Minimum wage going up.  Barely any threat of terrorism anymore.  Afghanistan's over.  It was great.  I just tweeted that old gag when he brought up Afghanistan.  Yeah.  Did you see what he wrote in on the unicorn, too? 
[00:11:30]  That was wonderful.  No one has figured out Afghanistan in the history of our country.  Not even our country.  And the fucking...  Even before our country, they were fucked up.  That's what I'm saying.  No one has ever been able to figure that one out.  And you've got to be crazy to think everything's going to be okay over there.  Hunky-dory.  It's going to go pretty much back to what it was.  That is just a weird fucking country.  Anytime you have fanatic religious fucking people in charge, it just...  It never bodes well for the people. 
[00:12:00]  I just...  I hate the State of the Union, because it's just bullshit across the board.  It was a fucking tent revival.  Like one of those religious tent revivals where they heal the fucking person in the wheelchair  or the crutches.  Let's bring up young Bobby here who has...  And that's what he does.  He goes around the room and it's like,  You know, Mary here sent me a letter.  That's it.  And it's like, no one's believing this shit.  Well, that started with Reagan, they said. 
[00:12:30]  Yes, huh?  Reagan was the first one that brought some of the heroes to the State of the Union.  Did he?  And pointed them out, so.  Well...  Your boy Reagan.  Yeah, that's my boy.  He's my boy Reagan.  Actually, that's my boy, too.  Ronnie.  I think that was the last president I really gave a shit about was Reagan.  Yeah.  He was an interesting fellow.  Well, when he just keeps doing that, like, it's pandering to everybody.  He was pandering to everyone.  The women thing.  And when women do well in this country, the country does well.  What does that mean? 
[00:13:00]  What does that even mean?  I'll tell you what it means.  They're happy, so they fuck us.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  You know what?  The equal pay for equal work for women, I'm all for that.  If a woman could take a fucking joke on the job and not try to get everyone involved fired.  Until then, fucking deal with less money, you fucking killjoys.  And take less in divorces.  Right.  And fucking, yeah, 50-50 split for a divorce.  And if you're going to show cleavage, we could comment how nice your cleavage is. 
[00:13:30]  We could comment on your beautiful tits and juicy asses.  And we should be able to pinch a hiney every once in a while.  Just grab it between your thumb and pointer finger.  And we should show respect in the workplace by not making inappropriate jokes.  Boo!  Boo!  Homo!  Oh, there it is.  You see the spinning tires on the news?  Oh, shit.  She's got to get out and push, yo. 
[00:14:00]  But, you know, and then Boehner has to sit there.  The best part about Boehner is him trying to figure out if he's supposed to, like, applaud.  Do I clap here?  Because he's not really listening to anything.  No.  But he knows he has to, like, of course, when the Corey fucking moment happens.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  If you're not standing up for that, you're just a monster.  That, uh, you can't applaud down party lines for that.  And then who's the asshole that stops his standing ovation for Corey?  Oh.  I thought that was going to go on for hours because everyone was scared to stop. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to be the first guy to stop.  You see a hero like that, you can't, you don't know who Corey is?  No, no, who is he?  Oh, my God.  He's a guy that got blown up in Afghanistan.  Oh, he's sold.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a fucking hero, to be honest with you.  But it was...  But, again, you know, it's...  And every politician, this isn't just Obama, you know, they parade people out to try to get that emotional moment and stuff.  And it's just, I don't know, I think it's degrading. 
[00:15:00]  I don't think...  Some pandering going on.  So much pandering.  Oh, was he just going off on everything and talking about how everything is great?  I've cut unemployment.  I've done this, the deficit.  It's like, what country are you talking about?  Did you see when he walked in?  That's the real Obama because the microphones pick him up.  How you doing, bro?  Bro and man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, brother.  Hey, bro.  Hey, brother.  Hey, man.  Hey, man. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, man.  And then he gets up there and it's a very different Obama.  Yep.  I don't know.  It's just horse.  There's Corey, if you look quickly.  Yes, Corey.  He's waving right there.  He got fucked up in Afghanistan, man.  People are looking at him crying.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was just...  It was certainly a moment, but...  Why is Hillary crying?  Did she claim to be there and then realize, oh, no, that wasn't true?  Oh, maybe that's...  Or somewhere else.  Or maybe she could have done something to prevent it, but didn't.  Oh, maybe that happened. 
[00:16:00]  So...  Ugh.  But it's just horseshit.  You know, half the place applauds or claps, whatever.  The other half, you know, sits on their hands.  You know?  Yeah.  And then every once in a while, everyone claps because they have to, or they look like assholes.  And no one's listening.  The Republicans didn't listen to a word Obama said.  Yeah.  And that's just how it is.  And then you got Joe Biden.  Like, he's Obama's, what?  Hype man.  His lap dog.  He couldn't jump up fast enough and start applauding.  He's Obama's flavor flay. 
[00:16:30]  He is.  Eeeh!  Yeah, Obama!  Eeeh, Obama!  He's Obama's diddy.  Yeah, all that shit.  Obama's motherfucking too short.  Right.  Yeah, you tell him, Obama!  I love, I do love watching it because of the complete horseshit that it is.  Yep.  And, and just, you know, I was getting more angered at the things he wasn't talking about.  And I understand it's his speech.  You know, he's not going to go off on things that, uh... 
[00:17:00]  No, it's supposed to be a rah-rah day.  Yeah, yeah.  So he's not going to say anything too difficult.  But, you know, it's the State of the Union.  You're pretty much supposed to, you know, tell, tell people what the State of the Union is.  And, uh, I don't know.  I was, all I was thinking was that whole, if you like your health care plan, you could,  you could keep it.  It's an outright lie.  It's an outright fucking lie.  He knew people weren't going to be able to keep their health care plans. 
[00:17:30]  He, he knew it.  And he told people that so that it wouldn't have, uh, any more hurdles in passing.  Because it never would have passed if, if, if he said that.  That everyone that has a great health care plan is going to be inconvenienced and fucked over, uh,  when, when this is enacted.  And, and I got my letter.  I got my letter.  And I, and now I got a deal.  It's just another thing that has to be dealt with.  That I got to fucking start dealing with insurance companies. 
[00:18:00]  It was fine.  I paid my premiums every month.  I liked my health care.  It, every time I, I went to the doctor or anything, it was, it was perfectly fine.  You chose your health care?  You chose a good health care?  I chose the, the plan I wanted.  It wasn't some shitty backroom health care.  No.  So, and now I got a letter that tells me that it's being canceled and that I'm going to  have to choose.  And it's giving me these fucking tiered things and, and I'll, I'll, I'll learn what my premiums  are in the future at some point. 
[00:18:30]  I don't need this shit.  I'm, I'm terrible with like paperwork and filling shit out in a timely fashion.  I don't need this other shit thrown at me.  And especially when I was lied to by the president and told that I would be able to keep it.  Oh, you got to pay for it.  Cause I have it through, I think, uh, after is where my insurance comes.  So you guys just pay for your, we have separate health, uh, insurance through our corporations.  You know, we have a health plan and, um, yeah, I was, I was sent a letter that said this, 
[00:19:00]  it does not adhere to the new standards that must be met with a maternity leave.  There's only two of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's two guys.  What the fuck are you doing that for?  They can't even offer that, that plan anymore in the United States.  The plan that I had, they're not even allowed to offer.  This doesn't include maternity leave and fucking child fucking care shit.  And I don't, I don't need maternity leave because I don't, I don't hire any broads in  my corporation.  No skirts in my business. 
[00:19:30]  I haven't hired a slit yet.  That's right.  I can still hang up naked calendars in my office.  Why would I ever hire a broad for my corporation?  Because you can pay her less without some uppity slit giving me any lip.  Where I got to deal with her periods.  Oh, fuck that.  And she can't come to work because a kid is sick?  Get the fuck out of here.  You think.  Nothing but men in my corporation.  Stay home, honey.  Right. 
[00:20:00]  Rattle the pots and pans.  Right.  When you're not working for my corporation.  You're done rattling those pots and pans.  Get in the bedroom.  Holla.  Do your duty there.  We have State of the Union clips, but I swear, we don't even need to play him.  It's the same shit.  It's the same garbage.  Same crap.  No matter who is up there.  No matter what president is up there.  Same lying shit.  You know, he talks about America. 
[00:20:30]  He talks about climate change.  He talks about the minimum wage.  Oh, another thing he mentioned was that people are signing up for Obamacare.  Right.  And he goes, and people are signing up.  Three million people have signed up for Obamacare and Medicaid.  He threw in, like, Medicaid.  To pump up the numbers?  And to pump up the fucking numbers.  Before Obamacare was even enacted, a fuckload of people would sign up for Medicaid every year. 
[00:21:00]  I have no problem with anyone pumping up the numbers.  But then he's pumping up.  You've got to pump up the numbers.  It's exactly what Penn was talking about with the, uh, and, you know, pre-recorded video clips.  Right, right, right.  That's exactly what he did.  And signing up for Obamacare and Medicaid.  Right.  Just pumping up the numbers.  More lying.  More blatant lying.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, brother.  Hey, man.  Hey, brother.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Eh, whatever. 
[00:21:30]  It was just fun to goof on.  Yeah.  And who was that?  What was that thing in the audience?  What thing?  That woman?  I think it was a woman.  Looked like Perry Pharrell.  Oh, yeah.  Does she have red hair, I think?  Yeah, man.  What was that?  Is that what's-his-name's, like, wife?  Oh, boy.  The dude that's, like, uh, what?  He's a Republican and she's a Democrat.  That couple?  Uh, James Carvel and, uh, her.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, yeah.  Was that her?  Mary fucking-  Yes.  I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know either.  There was a thing in the audience.  There was creeping a lot of people out when they went to her.  There's this fucking pomp and circumstance that goes on when people are coming in.  Right.  And it just reeks of-  Of yuck.  Royalty.  And, like, it's not supposed to be like that.  And I understand it's been like that for a long fucking time.  But these are supposed to be representatives of the people. 
[00:22:30]  And anyone that thinks that's going on is just fucking lost.  It's not a representative government anymore.  They all want to be rock stars.  Of course.  Did you watch at the end when Obama was leaving?  I like picking up on these weird, subtle things.  He's leaving and he's signing autographs, I guess.  And he actually goes, you having a good time so far?  Having a good time?  And I was thinking to myself, that's kind of weird.  Rock on!  It's the State of the Union address and he's asking people if they're having a good time so far.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  That's just strange.  I don't know.  And there's this thing that goes on when he walks in with, like, the black women that walk in.  It's almost this little wink, like, eh, eh, eh, we got him.  We got him.  He's smooching all the black women.  Mm-hmm.  And they all don't want to let him go.  Right.  Like, as he's moving along, they're still, like, yapping at him.  Like hens.  Yeah.  But they all got this look like, you're the president, motherfucker. 
[00:23:30]  And all these assholes, they have, like, five seconds to try to get their agenda in.  Yeah.  Because there's a rare opportunity where they get to actually, you know, see the president.  FaceTime.  So you know they're trying to babble really quickly in his ear.  Well, what about that thing?  Are we going to talk about that thing real quick?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up?  Hi, man.  Hi, man.  Hey, man.  Hi, man.  Hi, brother.  Him.  You think they just spit their agenda out quickly?  Oh, man.  Farm aid.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Please consider my bill. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, I hate them all.  Hey, man.  I just don't like anyone.  I think it's amazing how the Democratic president immediately gets the applause.  Like, he's just hitting them where they really live ideologically.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Republicans never agree.  Right.  They all clap and all don't clap at the same stuff.  And that's what...  And there's the problem with our country.  Period.  Should be done on a racial basis.  Period.  Of course.  And that's if all the blacks clap for him.  Yeah.  And none of the whites did.  That's how it's done.  Whites are just sitting there. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, oh, boo.  And when we have a Republican president, it'll be the same horse shit.  Where both sides will not fucking work together.  They just waste time down there.  Mm-hmm.  Can you imagine if they worked together at all, how much shit they actually would get done?  I like the fact that he didn't spend much time on guns at all.  No, he fucking failed that.  And already shut his ass down.  Good.  Thank God for the National Rifle Association.  He's pretty much failed with that agenda.  Yes, he did.  Bye-bye. 
[00:25:00]  Although, state-wise, especially New York State, when you've got someone like Cuomo in there,  just rattling off laws without any education on guns whatsoever.  Fuck him.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So I say we don't need to play the clips.  Nah, fuck the clips.  I want to play Michael Grimm threatening the New York One reporter.  Yeah, I guess he was supposed to be talking about the State of the Union address.  Right.  And the reporter hit him up with some kind of scandalous thing that he's involved in.  Well, New York One is on, is it on, do you have it on Long Island? 
[00:25:30]  I certainly have it on my, no, I have it on, is that Time Warner?  You have it on Time Warner, definitely.  That's the Time Warner one.  Time Warner one.  New York One.  Yeah, I have that on.  New York One could be the most boring news you could ever watch.  It's terrible.  It's horrendous.  It's terrible.  Oh, and this New York One reporter got into Michael Grimm's face.  Who's Michael Grimm?  He's, I don't even know, is it, is it, I would assume he's a Republican, right?  After this.  I'm not sure who the fuck is. 
[00:26:00]  Well, this clip made it to Mediaite.  Mediaite is in, I like that side.  Mediaite?  They throw all the clips from both sides on there, which I like.  You'll see clips from Fox News fucking up.  You'll see clips from MSNBC fucking up.  So, let's play this.  State of the Union, an interview our Washington reporter Michael Scotto had with Staten Island  Congressman Michael Grimm ended on a disturbing note with Grimm physically threatening.  Michael, we're going to show you how the interview ended. 
[00:26:30]  And just finally, before we let you go, since we have you here, we haven't had a chance to  kind of talk about some of the...  I'm not speaking about anything that's off topic.  This is only about the president.  Well, what about...  Thank you.  All right.  So, Congressman Michael Grimm does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning  his campaign finances.  We wanted to get him on camera on that.  But he, as you saw, refused to talk about that.  Back to you.  I can't hear him, though. 
[00:27:00]  Why?  This is a valid question.  You're telling me what the fuck you're talking about.  No.  You're not me.  You are not me.  Break you.  Oh, so I'll break you in half.  Yeah.  I'll break you in half.  What a fucking shark off.  Break you in half.  You see how scared he was, though, when he came walking over?  He looks like...  He looks like he's just out of college. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was hard to hear, but he basically said, I'll break you.  Or I'll break you in half and stuff like that.  Break you.  That's a tough guy right there.  He's a former Marine.  That guy.  He's like, you know, look out.  But the guy didn't really ask him in a nasty way.  He just asked him, and you guys didn't want to comment.  Ask the question.  You should be able to...  That's a real thing happening, so...  You're in the public eye.  You're a public servant.  You should be able to take a fucking question.  And you've got to assume they're going to ask that question.  So maybe you go fucking hide, like the rest of these guys do when they have a scandal. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You go hide for a while.  Lay low, motherfucker.  With Governor Christie.  We haven't heard from him since his fucking three-and-a-half-day fucking press conference.  That's a guy hiding, because he knows the questions are a little tougher right now.  Yep.  Whether he did anything or not, he's hiding, because that's what's going on.  Put a jerk off.  I'm with Jimmy on that.  Fucking jerk off.  All the cable companies have their little dumb news thing, like News 12 is cable vision. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, Christ is that bad.  And they're all awful.  And then Fios has its own, like, Fios news channel.  And it's all, like, they run through the news once, and then they just keep replaying it and replaying it.  And they all just look sad on TV.  Yeah.  They don't have much money for a wardrobe, I guess.  I think the real example of how awful they are is the fact that during 9-11, News 12 had some segment on cakes.  Oh, really?  Like, they were running some segment on cakes.  They weren't prepared? 
[00:29:00]  And it was like, it took forever before they finally went, like, hey, there's a terrorist attack happening on our country.  They're, like, talking about cakes.  Oh, that's great.  That is News 12.  Yeah.  And that was one of the cable vision selling points when I switched to Fios.  They're like, well, you're not going to get News 12.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  Carolyn Gustav.  I'm not going to get Carolyn Gustav.  Is she still there?  Gustav?  She's not there.  I think she...  No, no.  She moved on to New York City somewhere.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who knows?  It's not good news. 
[00:29:30]  No.  Hey, speaking of these news...  Who is...  What is this going on with the blow blow?  With Bobo?  What?  Did he win...  Did he win a date with that girl from that news channel?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  This is just breaking news from last night.  Apparently, there was some kind of contest.  Remember that baseball thing in Queens?  That Bobo went to...  The Mets?  The Mets dig.  No, it was like some... 
[00:30:00]  I think it was for Jackie Robinson or something, wasn't it?  It was some kind of event.  A statue?  It was an event.  Was it the Jackie Robinson statue unveiling?  No.  I think it was a...  Yeah, it was like some...  Whatever it was.  I think he entered some kind of contest to win a date with this girl, this Tara girl  right here, Tara McDonald, who's on...  What is she on?  I guess SNY? 
[00:30:30]  Wow.  Is she?  Where does it say?  What does it say?  News 12 Long Island.  News 12 Long Island.  Okay.  Right.  And they had some kind of a contest, and Bobo won.  So he's going to go out with this girl.  What?  So I tweeted her.  I'm like, oh man, we're going to have to brief you live on our program.  Right.  About Bobo.  Did she write you back?  Yeah.  She's very excited.  Oh, good.  She's very excited.  Are you trying to cock block Bobo?  Oh, what are you kidding?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  So apparently this is...  Let's Google Image this broad.  This is the real deal.  Yeah.  I'm going to Google Image this broad.  Let's see what we got here.  Is that her?  Yeah.  She's sexy.  Really?  She did some modeling, huh?  I don't know.  Yeah, she's all right.  She's nice.  Yeah, look at that.  Big giant tits.  She's nice.  And what did she do for News 12?  I don't know.  What?  She's some kind of assignment reporter.  Assignment reporter.  So they send her on the little fucking stories that are going on around Long Island. 
[00:31:30]  Oh my God.  And she'll be going to, I guess, a baseball game.  With Bobo.  With Bobo.  Oh my God.  Could you imagine this poor girl now sitting there and Bobo just, so, how long have you  been a Bits fan?  Just going on babbling to her.  But then there were times where I would go in and Jimmy would say something, but then  Opie would make me, and then Anthony, and she'd be like, what are you talking about?  He'll have two beers and go, I love you.  I love when he tries to talk about the show to people that don't give a shit or even know 
[00:32:00]  who we are.  I'm Bobo.  Right.  From the show.  From the show.  From the show.  From the show.  I'm Bobo from the show.  She's also a calendar girl for the Mets.  Oh boy.  All right.  That's great.  All right, Bobo.  I feel bad for the broad.  Oh, is she going to have a pisser with him?  How good would it be if they went away and she just fucked his brains out?  Oh, that wouldn't take much. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  Well, good luck.  I guess that story will develop.  Sure.  And then, of course, the big news, the Super Bowl.  It was a few days away.  Oh, yeah.  Has anyone been down to Super Bowl fucking Avenue down there on Broadway?  It's right there.  It's right outside this building.  Yeah.  They got a lot of things.  It just looks sad.  Does it?  Yeah.  We drive past it every day to go to work.  Yeah.  And everyone's out there guarding everything and they just look sad.  I guess.  They look fucking frozen. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  They got a lot of things to do out there.  If you want to try to kick a field goal or you can take a little like a toboggan ride  down one of those streets.  They set up a big ramp with toboggan and a lot of Super Bowl related events going on.  Well, how do we walk around there?  Oh, well.  How do we walk around there proper?  Look, there is Fox News.  They're down there.  This is the heater that we use to stay alive.  Let's cross the street a little bit.  How you doing?  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  How you doing?  One person out there to see you. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  We're going to just cross the street a little bit to Fox Way.  Fox Way.  How does that sound stupid?  Here we go.  Here's the team of men cleaning everything up.  Over straight across is the affiliates who have gathered here.  There's nothing going on.  He's trying to describe the scene.  This is a man with a shovel, but this is not the type of shovel you can get at home.  All right.  Now he's scooping on it.  If you work for the city, this will actually be the place where all the talk leading up 
[00:34:00]  to the Super Bowl will take place.  Players have come.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  What a bust this is, though.  Oh, what a bust.  I couldn't be happier.  No one cares about Super Bowl Road.  Fox Way.  Fox Way.  Yeah.  That's where the sexy chick shit was.  Yeah.  CNN Boulevard.  I'm sure they all have to get in there a little.  Fox Building.  In about 30 minutes, we have a tour.  We're inside.  There are three stories of buildings and a great green room. 
[00:34:30]  George M. Cohen, I believe he's a Yankee Doodle Dandy.  That's a statue that was built actually before we got here.  This is the largest temporary structure in the history of Times Square.  We're going to be bringing you all the action for the next three days.  Back to you guys.  What a terrible...  I guess today it finally pumps up, but...  I don't know.  I think they're regretting that they put the Super Bowl in a cold area.  I love that it's freezing.  I couldn't be happier.  It's going to be all right for the game, though, I think.  It's going to be upper 30s.  Kenny pointed out that it's going to be at night, though. 
[00:35:00]  It's 6 at night, so it will be chilly.  True.  I think it's going to be, you know, like mid-30s then.  We all really wanted below freezing and crazy blizzard-like snowstorm.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll get lucky.  Mid-30s sucks, though.  That's cold, man.  To be sitting there, not moving.  Outdoor game is...  That's fucking cold.  That's easy.  That's easy.  It's too bad it's not colder.  This guy's working the Super Bowl.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up? 
[00:35:30]  Peyton.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, yeah.  I'm working for a graphics company over here.  We're doing everything.  You know, we're working on the locker rooms the past couple days.  We finished up the Broncos yesterday.  Working on Seahawks today.  Switching over from the Jets to the Broncos, Giants to Seahawks.  That's what he tells his friends.  What a clusterfuck it is over here, let me tell you.  Oh, fuck.  Sunday is 44.  Oh, now it's even higher.  Well, that sucks. 
[00:36:00]  Why is it a clusterfuck?  Nobody has their shit straight.  But they're still cleaning up snow.  You know how they were saying, like, oh, we got all this shit.  We'll take care of it in no time.  It'll be gone by then.  Snowed last night, too, though.  Yeah, they'll get the snow out of the state.  I don't think it's the problem.  That's easy.  It's a fucking dusting.  It's a fucking dusting.  But, I mean, it's pretty cool, though.  We get to watch the rehearsals with the halftime.  Holy fuck.  Seriously?  That was...  Go call your brother. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  That was a call that you call your family and go,  Yeah, I'm here, you know.  There's rumors that this show's being heard around the world.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  We're not having a beer.  Ooh, the food's here, though.  Yeah, I'm doing the drywall down there.  That's his fucking...  All right, we're gonna go eat.  Yeah, let's eat.  We got Super Bowl food coming in today.  And I know the listeners love when we have food.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  It's going to be one of the most popular things we do on this very program  is to eat and have the listeners just enjoy that.  It's always a great break.  Yeah.  Try one of these.  And then off mic.  Wow, this is really good.  Yeah.  And then the guys always try to get dumb plugs.  Yeah, you can get it on Tuesdays.  It's half off.  Come down, just tell them Gino sent you.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Fucking food.  Take it and choke on it. 
[00:37:30]  I'll buy it myself.  My favorite, though, is like, so where is your restaurant?  Well, actually, we don't have a restaurant.  What do you have?  On Tuesdays, we're in Union Square on the southwest corner.  So, in other words, this is useless.  The guy making meatballs in his house.  Hey, I like the meatball guy, for real.  I don't mean him.  I'm just using that as an example.  I kind of miss his meatballs, especially the turkey one.  Mama Mancini's are very good.  Mama Mancini's are good. 
[00:38:00]  What about Roro?  Is he torn today?  Because he's on a diet, and now we've got Super Bowl food coming in.  No, because he's not on a Super Shred diet anymore.  He's on the magic diet where you can eat all you want but still lose weight.  That sounds very good.  We went to Chipotle yesterday.  He does not suffer.  He went to Chipotle?  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  I don't go to Chipotle.  And he had a big burrito for breakfast yesterday.  I mean, he's good.  He's figured something out.  Diets like that make me fucking sick, where you can eat whatever you want, and they're 
[00:38:30]  just trying to convince you.  Fuck, yeah, you don't have to suffer at all.  That's not what a diet is.  But that's how you'll get healthy.  No.  But wasn't he doing that before?  Yeah, what's the difference?  What is he, sprinkle magic dust on his head?  On his belly?  What happens?  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  That's making him lose weight.  He was eating Chipotle before he was on a diet.  Yeah, but he was getting rice in the burrito bowl.  Now, no rice, because he's doing it without grains or sugar.  Oh, right.  Ah, sugar.  Ah, sugar. 
[00:39:00]  How about you just eat grilled chicken, some vegetables, and fucking some low, you know,  no sugar stuff, and just fucking...  Here comes Rowe Rowe now.  A little fish.  I mean, he's lost 16 pounds.  No, no, I know.  I'm singing general.  Oh, he's going to fucking mushroom stamp you in a second here.  Oh, man.  Here comes the Rowe Rowe.  I know it took you to me.  Is he coming in?  Yeah.  Rowe Rowe!  Yes, Rolando.  It's not Rowe Litt.  I Rowe.  You went to Chipotle?  Chipotle's on your diet?  Yeah.  Fuck Dr. Ian. 
[00:39:30]  Fuck Dr. Ian.  That's how she write, like, an index.  You can eat better and still eat his weight.  So what kind of stuff did you have at Chipotle?  I love Chipotle.  I love deliciousness.  Did he go with the cheese?  Yes.  Cheese is on your diet?  Yes.  Holy fuck.  Whatever you want, it's still this way.  Just no sugars.  What about sour cream?  I don't like sour cream.  Oh, guacamole?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Guacamole.  Isn't guacamole kind of fat?  Doesn't it have sugar in it?  Or no?  No.  You can't eat fruit.  Egg whites are bad?  Yeah, they say if you eat too much of it, it turns into protein. 
[00:40:00]  And then it's fat.  Protein is okay, though, if you're exercising.  Like, I like protein.  I eat a lot of grilled chicken.  Oh, yeah, but if you don't exercise, they say...  Yeah, you've got to exercise.  So you're losing weight by going to Chipotle?  Yeah, the diet to Chipotle is okay, but no egg whites.  It's a weird one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have the whole egg, fill a little bacon on the side.  Boom.  Yeah, boom.  I was reading his breakfast yesterday.  He said it was great.  It was like an egg omelet.  Not egg white omelet, but a real omelet. 
[00:40:30]  And it had American cheese.  Oh, Swiss.  And cheddar, yeah.  American cheese and cheddar.  Shutter cheese.  And bacon and ham and sausage, right?  Yes.  Right.  I don't know how that works out in a long run.  Grim's response.  A reporter took a cheap shot.  I was angry and reacted accordingly.  Oh.  According to that?  It wasn't a cheap shot.  No.  No.  A reporter's a jerk-off, so it's fair.  But when you're in that life, you can't react, though.  No, that guy was asking a basic question that everyone wants to know the answer to. 
[00:41:00]  You're a public, um...  You're a public figure.  Right.  And people do want to know about that shit.  Uh-huh.  So if it is bullshit, then just say it's bullshit.  Right.  Don't get in...  Don't fucking tell the reporter you're going to break him in half.  It's in his face.  Right.  And today is a delicious food.  What are we looking at?  Yeah.  Ice cream sandwiches.  Because I know you love ice cream sandwiches.  Ice cream sandwiches.  What does that have to do with the Super Bowl?  Ribs.  Ice cream sandwich cracked my teeth last night.  My fake teeth.  I went to unwrap it. 
[00:41:30]  I went to unwrap it, and I used my teeth.  I forgot about it.  It's just something you can just automatically do.  Right.  And I went to rip the plastic off the ice cream sandwich, and poosh, like two of them just  cracked right off.  From biting an ice cream sandwich wrapper?  Yeah, because I was using my teeth to rip the plastic, and it went, poosh, it just  like cracked.  So I had to take crazy glue and crazy glue them back into my head, and then I had to  eat the ice cream sandwich with a knife and fork.  You're crazy gluing your teeth?  I crazy glued my teeth back in. 
[00:42:00]  You're a millionaire.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to talk about Ant's teeth and nutrition.  What's that?  Sam's handing it out.  What?  Eat Chipotle nutritional facts.  Oh, I see the calories when I go in there.  I say whatever.  Are you saying these are good?  Sam or a lot?  I don't know.  I figured you'd know better than me because you're...  Did you do the side of chips?  What's that?  No.  No, no, no, no, like, uh... 
[00:42:30]  That's a grain.  Yeah, a grain.  So it sounds like you...  All right, you might have done it right.  Who knows?  You said grains are bad.  Yeah.  We got two...  It was a nice hearty lunch, though, wasn't it?  Oh, yeah.  Did you guys get the Philadelphia masturbation story?  Yes.  That's a great one, too.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Metro North?  Oh, yeah, she's taking...  No, that's a different one.  There's two masturbation stories in the news we're going to talk about next.  Thank God.  And then a teen that looks like...  I don't know if it's a he or she.  I think it's a she.  I think it is a she.  She survived a skydive accident.  Oh, yeah.  16-year-old girl. 
[00:43:00]  She fell 3,000 feet.  She's alive.  Ooh, there's a lot of the details on that.  And then we got an opera singer there that can't work because...  She had an operation.  Yeah, after surgery, it leaves her farting a lot.  Yeah.  She said, make me Jim Norton.  And then we got to finally get into my 600-pound life.  Oh, we finally got the audio from that fucking piece of shit.  Penny, the one you absolutely hate.  We got clips from that episode.  So, lots to listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio jam. 
[00:43:30]  Did you see Bobo's penis?  I agree.  He's packing some wood?  Fuck, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  You're packing major wood, Bobo?  Fuck, yes, he is.  Oh, Jimmy.  Here go the curtains.  Patrice, you start talking like erotic, and it'll get hard instantly.  And then you talk about the Mets, and he'll lose the hard-on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, drop it down.  Drop it down, Pinnitus.  There's women's shirt.  All it down.  Fancy underpants, though. 
[00:44:00]  See?  No.  No, you have to watch it jump.  It's like, the bottom line is this.  Christina and her big tits.  You have to get her into a hotel room sooner or later.  Yeah.  You know those big, luscious tits, you want to just put them soap on them in the shower?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Show up!  The fucking Mets are just terrible, dude.  Why are they so awful?  This is your players this year.  But they can't win a fucking game.  Look, it's already...  Why can't they win a game? 
[00:44:30]  It's embarrassing.  I...  I have no idea, but is this...  Is this a new bit that I got to talk pantsless now?  No, I was...  Forget pantsless.  Why are the Mets losing?  We finally shut up.  Why are the Mets losing, Bobo?  I...  That's what happened.  Our better players are hurt.  But there's no reason for the whole franchise to be suffering like that.  Mixing up nice.  Yeah.  Would you take Christina to a Mets game?  I would.  I'd take her.  And, of course, I'd go with her to a Yankee game. 
[00:45:00]  Do you think that she'd want to take you to a motel after?  Oh, man.  Well, yeah, of course.  I'm thinking that she'd slide those little thong panties off, too, if you took her to a motel.  Yeah, but you know what I might do get her the next time I'm at the Stress Factory?  I might get her one of those, uh...  Those, uh...  You could take me...  I think it says you could take me to the Stress Factory after you've finished me off.  Oh, my God! 
[00:45:30]  The fucking patient waiting is the funnest part.  I don't know.  This is...  Patrice is fucking crying.  He's leaving the studio.  Patrice was crying.  He was crying.  He had tears coming down his fucking brain.  I know, you're thinking...  Would you titfucker, though, if you could? 
[00:46:00]  I would.  I would.  I would.  I would.  Show us on Pat.  There it is!  There it is!  There it is!  This is the fucking...  I'm telling you...  I have to sit home and wonder what...  This has to rank in the top five most unbelievable things.  I've never seen anything like this.  Fuck! 
[00:46:30]  It's raging!  I can't laugh no more!  Yeah, no, it hurts.  Opie and Anthony are back  on with the fart jokes  on SiriusXM  oh yeah  Motley Crue saying goodbye right  yeah that's complete bullshit  I don't buy that at all 
[00:47:00]  that's the old who thing  the who said goodbye and then ended up touring for another 15 years  something like that  maybe even 20  if I remember I saw them in Buffalo  what year was this  yeah 88, 89 maybe  and it was their farewell tour  farewell  and then I think the who performed last year  they're still doing it  1982 was their first farewell tour  1982?  holy fuck really  I don't think anyone's buying that Motley Crue 
[00:47:30]  is actually saying goodbye  they're saying this is it  they signed a legal document  promising that they'll never reunite after next tour  because they know everyone is thinking  oh this is bullshit  so then they go around  they're in a room somewhere going  well how do we make people really think this is it  but the key words is really  really think this is it  and then what is  what does the legal document mean?  you know what I noticed  I was reading the article  and the legal document says  that they will not tour again 
[00:48:00]  and none of the members will be able to use  after 2015  and none of the members will be able to use the name Motley Crue  that doesn't mean that they can't just do a residency  in Vegas  they're not touring  they can do what they want  it's just a great idea by a publicist  that's what it is  yeah  all I'm saying  no one's buying it  yeah  but it pumps up ticket sales  which is good for them  they're going to go on a 72 day tour  starting immediately  that they want to sell out  right  and then they'll probably take a year or two off  and then figure out a way around the legal documents 
[00:48:30]  what else do they  these guys have nothing else going for them  no  nothing  what are they going to do?  they'll probably rip it up on stage  because they're such badasses  they are badasses  oh yeah  and what binding document would that be?  hey you guys want a tour?  I'd love to  but remember we said we wouldn't  and the document  like who's going to enforce that?  yeah who would be liable for something?  I'm sure  if they all decide they're going to  and I'm sure there's some weird fine print  yes  this means nothing  it says at the bottom 
[00:49:00]  exactly  fine print  yeah  I know  he's with someone though  what's up with the  I don't know  that's a very cute girl  I'm an opera singer  that's like  who?

[00:55:30]  a letter from the  Corinthians  that's right  dear Opie and Anthony  oh  what about Jim Norton  hey look  they heard the intro  go ahead  oh wow  Friday this past week  you received a large box  of quote commercial brand chocolates  and were really  that was the Stover's  right  the CVS chocolate  sucked  and were really critical  of the quality  of those chocolates  absolutely were  and I called  and spoke with you  on air  about how all chocolates 
[00:56:00]  are not created equal  and how new  and innovative chocolates  shouldn't be  are being made by  one fifth of chocolate  do you remember  talking to this guy  do you remember  talking to him  nope  new and innovative chocolates  are being made  by many confectioners  innovative chocolates  the commercial brands  make them to sit  on store shelves  for a long period  of times  yeah  period of  period times  he's a chocolate guy  what does he know  and don't worry so much  about quality 
[00:56:30]  because they are just  mass producing them  oh this thing goes on  it's a page  what the fuck  it's a lonely chocolate guy  right  Billy Wonka  so you mentioned  that you liked samples  and I told you  that I would send you  some of the best chocolates  I do remember this guy  you have ever tasted  you weren't here  yeah I was  that was Friday  no he called Tuesday  he's looking cheeky  you know what that means  cheeky Jimmy  I do good  and then I get cheeky  alright the truffles

[00:57:30]  shortchange the listeners  by not being hungry  and eating on the air  I love that  when they come in  and we all just go  oh it's really good  tell us about the recipe  give me some of that  you know a lot of people  they don't put too much sugar  but what we do  is we put them in  shut up  shut up  he gives a fuck  I gotta say  the Munson's chocolates  truffle smell  unbelievable  and he uses the words  private reserve  well  I reserve my privates 
[00:58:00]  for just special people  like Jimmy  and by that  you mean any people  are you still reading the note  yeah  why  the note  so you mentioned  you like samples  and I told you  I would send you  some of the best chocolates  you have ever tasted  made locally in Connecticut  sure  Connecticut  and shipped all over the world  right  this is a run on sentence  while we still use  some of the original recipes  our founder came up with 
[00:58:30]  back in 1946  we are always  who's their founder  Adolf Hitler  oh  oh wait  by 46 he was dead  expanding with new ideas  and confections  for all to joy  so they've been around  since 1946  and no one knows their name  they started on Fox Way  Munson  old Munson  got back from the war  and decided  I've seen enough  death and carnage  I'm going into chocolate  I'm going into a happy business  that's it  I'm going to build  a chocolate factory  I'm going to be  the chocolate king 
[00:59:00]  of Connecticut  right  is the note  still being read  it's not  halfway over  holy shit  what could he possibly  write about chocolate  right  I don't know  what else  he continues  I think you will find  that Munson's Chocolates  will be on the top  of your list  when it comes to  quality confections  did you have a list  not my chocolate  confections list  I never want to hear  quality confections  again  confections  my list 
[00:59:30]  I have to  I have to look at my list  of quality confections  yes  that is a good point  and see if  who's on top  exactly  yeah  enclosed  you will find a selection  we make over  250 varieties  of chocolates  of some of our  customers favorites  assorted chocolates  pecan caramel  patties  popcorn shrimp  barbecue shrimp  shrimp cocktail  that means they're  dumb pecans 
[01:00:00]  yeah  see if they're patties  what's  what's some of them  other chocolates  we got  mmm  chocolate covered  Oreo  almond tofu  butter crunch  sea salt brittle  that ain't pretty good  potato chip  pretzel  coconut  Oreo  peanut butter  jumbled totes  he went through  he wrote down  all of them  all of them  we know what he sent  we looked at it  we're looking at it  right now  you actually missed  what you're supposed  to read on the note  anyway  oh  what was that  what part  I'll give it 
[01:00:30]  here's the entire note  dear Opie and Anthony  you were talking  about chocolate  these are the ones  I make  please plug me  on the air  that is  right to the point  exactly  that's all we needed  are you mad that I didn't  hand the note back to you  no  not at all  well I like the Munson's  chocolates  they're pretty goddamn good  I gotta be honest 
[01:01:00]  I'm not eating any  yeah  yeah  but this  fucking  chocolate almond  sea salt brittle  looks amazing  oh boy  it looks like a  fucking home run  enough with sea salt  by the way  on everything  it's on everything  exactly  it's the newest  fucking fad  to just dump on everything  yeah man  it's alright  sprinkle some on a vagina  before you go down on it  sea salt vagina  that's good  it's really a treat  for the listeners  it just melts 
[01:01:30]  this is only the first  of our two food breaks  today  yay  that is true  this is  this is more  deserty  yeah we gotta eat  the Munson's chocolate  after the Super Bowl food  yeah  the listeners demand  it  they love it  it be done that way  oh do they love it  alright why don't we move on  we got jerk off stories  we got an opera singer  farting  and we also got  the Macklemore  more Macklemore shit  oh yeah  what is he up to now  is he groveling  or is he pontificating 
[01:02:00]  is all this in the clip  or can I read  I don't know  what you have in front of you  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis  talk Grammy Weddings  idea  getting goosebumps  Macklemore  still gets chills  when talking about  his Grammy's performance  and the 33 weddings  that occurred on stage  as he and Ryan Lewis  performed their hit  Same Love  it just gives me goosebumps  to talk about it now  to watch the Staples Center  just sort of erupt  and stand up  and participate  in that ceremony  it was magic 
[01:02:30]  oh it was not  the Seattle rapper  added that he got emotional  during rehearsal  and while performing  the third verse of the song  as the couple  started their procession  procession  excuse me  meanwhile Lewis explained  that the idea  of the on stage weddings  came from  Grammy's producer  Ken Elrick's daughter  who's a big fan  of the group  and knew that  they often had people  propose on stage  adding that the idea  just grew from there  propose that they  stop playing  because they're terrible  oh Jesus 
[01:03:00]  it was just a  it's a morning zoo bit  yeah  at the grand  yeah  morning zoos  do that shit  yes  why does he annoy me  he annoys me this guy  he fucking annoys  the shit out of me  I don't talk  I mean I'm only asking  in third grade  he thought he was  to say that  like in that  in the rap thing  and then be a part of this  is he just  like hey he's just  for everybody  or is he trying to  like test the waters  no he's not gay  no okay  it's the same reason  he's apologizing  for being white 
[01:03:30]  and he's apologizing  for winning awards  and he wants to make sure  that everybody's okay  with him  and he's just  yeah  yeah  I don't know  I think  what's wrong  nothing  wild thing  nice  yeah  something  something  not right  there  I smell  that shit  out  the dude  not the dude  anyway  so is that  this is the clip  from Ellen DeGeneres  yeah  you ask  you ask  why he bothers you 
[01:04:00]  you'll hear it  for yourself  in this clip  I haven't even  seen this clip  yet  but he  yeah  I mean  he's a phony  what the fuck  is going on  Jim's eating popcorn  no but I'm just  thinking of your  observations  just looking  yeah  something not right  well it's okay  there's too many treats  in the studio  that's the only  it's all this  fucking chocolate  I had one little  bite of that  fucking sea salt 
[01:04:30]  thing  it was as good  as I thought  it would be  was it good  yeah  what an observation  all right  let's listen to  the Macklemore  on the Ellen  DeGeneres  show  tours  and it's got  to be so  gratifying  to do it  your way  because you  really did  do it  in a way  that no other  artists have  it's been  it's been  a very cool  journey  it started  with the fans  it spread  organically  and you know  we have a lot  of praise  to show  you 
[01:05:00]  because this  was the first  time that we  ever performed  live on  television  you got  behind  same love  before anybody  else did  before it was  a radio song  before it was  out there  with the video  on MTV  you were behind  it so  it's a beautiful  song  I am not  100% convinced  about what  it's a beautiful  song and I'm so  glad that it's  become such a  huge success  more people are  hearing it  and whose idea  was that  performance  and everyone 
[01:05:30]  getting married  and Madonna  being a part  of it  how'd that  come up  you know  it started  Ken Ehrlich  who's the  producer  of the show  his daughter  these guys  don't sound  like rappers  no  who's that  it's Ryan  Lewis  who's that  the other guy  from Maclemore  he's the other  guy from Wham  pretty much  Andrew Ridgely  that's who it was  he's the Andrew Ridgely  it was so emotional 
[01:06:00]  of Maclemore  I was crying  Portia was crying  and then you could  see  so was  Mercedes  why are you crying  because people  are getting married  like that  I'm just crying for  them and the misery  they're about to endure  exactly  it was so forced  and quick  it was a bit  I feel bad for the  people that ended up  getting married in that  way  instead of maybe  having a really nice  ceremony with their  family and friends  they have to quickly  walk up an aisle  start kissing  and then you know  really quickly  because they got to  get to the next bit  right  what's this song  I don't even know  this song 
[01:06:30]  oh we're not playing  it again  is it good  oh I can't  no it's that  babbling one  no no no  I don't know  it  no  come on  oh god  that sounds okay  does it  he just turned to be  gay  people get ready  I thought that I was  gay  because I could draw  my uncle was  and I kept my room  straight  I thought I was gay  because I could draw  was he drawing  fuck off  he was drawing  big cocks  he was drawing loads  out of balls  oh drawn 
[01:07:00]  he was like  oh that's different  he was like one of  those fucking  Indian state charmers  but he would get  cum to shoot out  into his own eye  no please  turn this off  I thought I was  gay  you're gay  you gay  that's why  you gay  because you gay  I've never heard  a good song  alright good  let's go back to  yeah  there's no  I mean there's a hook  but it's not like  he just goes on  and on about 
[01:07:30]  this  this is the hook  well this is where  the song gets beautiful  you don't like rappers  didn't say that  but  you just have her  sing the song  she did  who is she  she's I don't know  her name  she was the fatso  on stage  doing the grammy  but she did the song  without him  and it's not as successful  I don't care  she might be a fatso  but she has a beautiful voice  he has good choruses  this guy  I have to fucking say  I don't like him  and his hairdo  is borderline enraging  but he has fucking 
[01:08:00]  got some choruses  come on  good chorus guy  let's not forget  Macklemore also thinks  that Bush  you know  knocked down  the Twin Towers  some of those guys  yeah  very original idea  for a lib cunt  not for him  that's why I don't  think he's gay  because I think  if he was even  kinda gay  he would just  embrace it to the fullest  like he wishes  he probably wishes  he was gay  he's probably like  sucking dick  left and right  just wishing  he's trying  what do you guys  fuck about  oh  Macklemore  Macklemore 
[01:08:30]  Macklemore  he's probably like  sucking a lot of dick  just hoping that  he finally finds  the taste of it  he's like  appealing  so then he can  finally admit to the world  nope I am  I am  I'm gay  he kept his room  clean and drew  so that means  he's gay  he thought he was gay  in third grade  it's probably OCD  it's probably  he's neat and everything  I always had to  turn the doh knob  three motherfucking times  that's cause you're  fucking  mentally ill  what's bothersome to me 
[01:09:00]  is he's not  this guy  he's portraying  it's forced  it's an act  it's bullshit  in my opinion  he doesn't just spend  every minute of  every waking hour  caring about somebody  trying to be accepting  of somebody  trying to make sure  everybody feels okay  feeling guilty about  his white privilege  and um  yeah  having to tell people  having to apologize  to people  he's a great fucking  great hairdo  um 
[01:09:30]  if he's gonna be  fucking morphed into  all these things  like zelly  what a great  gump hairdo  I don't like  his stupid  forest gump hairdo  gump hairdo  I was running  with my asshole  open backwards  so I thought  I was gay  shut up  fucking idiots  I'm trying to be  a person for everyone  just be you  I'm a lame white guy  who writes good choruses  you love those choruses  huh  I gotta be honest  you can't say  that that sucks  I hate that fucking  Robin Thicke though 
[01:10:00]  enough already  with that dumb  summer song  blurred lines  it's a great song  it's terrible  enough with it  though  you're right  yeah  is there any more  of this  on LA  oh yeah yeah  I'm sorry  I didn't mean  morphed  no please  I'm gonna cut it short  it's my fault  I definitely did  I got emotional  during rehearsal  and I got emotional  during the performance  when  during the third verse  I started rapping  and that's when  the procession of couples  started to come in  you could hear people cheering  and everyone stood up  at that point  and you know 
[01:10:30]  it just gives me goosebumps  thinking about it  now to watch like  you know  the Staples Center  kind of erupt  and stand up  and participate  in that ceremony  it was magic  it's funny  because I could hear  everyone starting to cheer  when you were singing  and I thought  because I knew  Madonna was going to sing  with y'all  and I thought  is she somewhere  that people are seeing her  but it was  they were cheering  for the purple  I was just thinking  I was rapping  really well  love this verse  not at all  it was the couples  but Madonna was great 
[01:11:00]  it's actually  Madonna called me  last night  after she got off stage  to wish me a happy birthday  which was really sweet  hi Madonna  she doesn't know  it was her birthday  happy birthday  happy birthday  but she called me  right afterwards  she was so emotional  wasn't it  so  and it was  it was just so  the impact was  I think  what a success  Ellen is  Jesus Christ  I remember her  many years ago  and I don't know her  but she was watching her  in that kind of like  Brian Regan-ish outfit  yeah yeah  she was funny man  yeah she was very funny  I liked her in 
[01:11:30]  Mr. Wrong  that movie  oh yeah  you know what she played  with the guy from  fucking Independence Day  right  yeah  Bill Pullman  Bill Pullman and her  as a little rom-com  thing going on  which  I don't think  the chemistry  was really there  well Mr. Wrong  is correct  yes yes  Mr. Wrong  you should be a question mark  after Mr. Wrong  yeah  get to the end of this clip  please  it's been close  not at all 
[01:12:00]  not at all  still don't have  her cell phone number  but  yeah you know  that was again  Ken's idea  and she was  so gracious to come  shut up  it was great  so gracious  what are you talking about  he's a rapper for  Suburban  like kind of ladies  yeah  but break it down  Madonna was gracious  for doing this with him  Madonna wanted her exposure  exactly  they're all just  liars  stop it 
[01:12:30]  bunch of bullshit artists  phonies  he's just  no one is as nice  as Macklemore  that's why it's bothersome  yeah he's so  no one is that nice  I'm sorry  they're just not  accepting of everything  I am  and they won best rap  they were real rappers  nominated  that's kind of funny  and then they gave it to him  motherfucker  that's bullshit  that's bullshit  alright  hey hey hey  hey hey hey  hey hey 
[01:13:00]  I love that he's not  I love that he's not  quite in shape  as he sings this song  he's not a slob right  but he's like  a little out of shape  he's a bit puffy  he's got a little meat  under the chin  he's hitting middle age  he's got a little ponch  as he's  right  singing blurred lines  hey hey hey  this really is a great song  oh  I love this song  do you not like it  I'm sorry  no I shouldn't say it sucks  I'm just like I'm like it 
[01:13:30]  this fucking  I like the video  I'll tell you that much  oh yeah  these girls are fucking stunning  god damn  oh my god  good god  she's just naked  that's right  hey hey hey hey  these are attractive girls  on this video  you see their titties too  yes  and this is the unedited one  where they're just walking around  with their tits hanging out  what the hell is she doing there  trying to play the guitar  oh man  she's good looking too  oh my god 
[01:14:00]  that one's ridiculous  look at the fucking  who's that one  I don't know  oh my god  look at the fucking body  on this girl  I know  imagine she's just taking a dump  and walking across that white floor  she's stunning  yeah like a fucking pony  who cares  I'd slip in it  and roll around in it  I'd rut  I'd rut in her shit  slip in it

By the way, he's already heard that message 
[01:18:00]  because he was staring when he saw the number came up  and he was just like, I'm not going to deal with these guys today.  We're going to call him back.  Let's see Colbert  talk about the Macklemore.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much.  Folks, I don't know if you watched it, but...  Stephen Colbert's a rock star.  ...was music's  biggest event of the year, the Grammys.  Of course, big winners of the night  were Macklemore and Ryan Lewis,  who won four Grammys, including Best Rap Album,  beating out Kanye West, 
[01:18:30]  Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and Jay-Z.  Which means  the white people have officially won rap.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for rap.  At the bottom of the screen.  You fought bravely,  but we'll take it from here.  Now, unfortunately,  the evening was marred  when my friend Macklemore and Lewis  had to politicize their gay anthem,  Same Love.  And he gets all the same love  about time that we raised up.  We are gathered here 
[01:19:00]  to celebrate love and harmony  in every key,  in every color.  As I look out on this audience,  I'm delighted to see the faces  of 33 couples  who've chosen this moment  to celebrate their vows with us  here in Los Angeles.  By the power bested in me  by the state of California,  I now pronounce you  a very small boy!  I don't know about you,  but Madonna's entrance  gave me an urge  to eat a bucket of fried chicken.  Yeah, am I right?  I can't believe it. 
[01:19:30]  Come out with the cane.  Did you have the hurricane?  They stand up by themselves,  you know.  One has a headlight.  Or she had a Dolly Parton transplant.  Folks, I cannot believe  that on national television  they held a mass gay wedding.  Now, officially,  officially,  it was only 33 couples,  but who knows  how many people 
[01:20:00]  were inadvertently gay married  last night.  It's just like a Gallagher concert.  The first two rows  are in the gay splash zone.  Well, I hope, I hope,  I hope that  Dave Grohl and Jay-Z  will be very happy together.  Though it might be  a little tough on Beyoncé  and her new spouse,  Taylor Swift.  Do not break her heartbeat  or she will write  a very catty song about you.  Other big winners last night  include Alicia Keys,  Paul McC...  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  You don't find  Taylor Swift attractive?  I don't know.  Yeah, she's all right.  I think her personality  and everything  really kind of  like makes you  if you're looking  at the whole package,  which means you've got  to throw the personality  in there as well.  That's what bothers me.  And she wears those  dumb fucking  old lady shorts  and stuff.  Frumpy clothes  and frumpy clothes.  I think when she puts  on a nice dress  and stuff,  she looks good,  I think.  She's all right  in the face.  I think she does.  Yeah.  She's pretty, 
[01:21:00]  I think.  Yeah.  Um...  Yeah.  Look at her, though.  The dumb fucking  big pants.  Those stupid shorts  are in, though.  The stupid things  that go way up  to the midsection  of the girl.  What happened  to hot pants?  I want some hot pants.  Oh, that's a skinny leg.  That's what I'm saying.  She's too long  and skinny.  Yeah.  But she's nice  in the face.  Those shorts  are rough  to look at.  They really are.  Hey, hey, hey.  Um...  Our, uh...  Our boy, uh... 
[01:21:30]  Superfly.  Okay, brother.  Did I kill  my girlfriend?  Gonna be arrested  for murder?  Okay.  Yeah.  Murder.  Okay.  What happened?  What happened?  Not buying.  It was an accident?  Okay.  What did he say?  She was walking  in a, uh...  Okay.  A fucking...  A walnut fell out  of the tree  and killed her.  Right.  Killed her.  And fell over  on a rock  or something  at a weird motel,  hotel,  or a rest area.  Didn't he say  it was a rest area?  I'll implicate myself  on your radio dog. 
[01:22:00]  Radio dog.  Fucking Superfly.  Superfly.  So what?  They're opening up  the case.  Reopening it.  Since...  I think it happened  in 83?  In 83.  That's a cold case  file right there.  Boy, is that...  Yeah.  That's 31 years ago.  When some new detective  went in,  pulled it off  the top shelf,  blew some dust off  and went,  this is the Superfly  Snooker fucking chair.  Let's look into this 
[01:22:30]  again.  Open that case.  And the article  includes a picture  of him on our show.  Oh, on your radio dog.  No, does it?  Nice.  Oh my God.  And that's fucking  probably where it came from.  Okay.  Oh no.  What did he say about it?  Superfly Snooker  visits the Opie and Anthony  show at Sirius XM Studios  in New York City  earlier this month.  Well, I think  it was a year ago.  It definitely wasn't  this month.  No, not at all.  And he did talk about it.  Yes.  Yes, he did.  We asked him about it.  Yeah, we sure did. 
[01:23:00]  We're hard-hitting journalists.  But Opie was confused  to some of the details  of the case.  Well, I don't remember.  I do.  What do you mean?  I was confused.  Jimmy's eyes in the clip  is the greatest thing ever.  Oh yeah, what?  You were freaked out.  You just wanted to cover it up.  And I wanted to sit there badly.  I knew exactly  what I was doing.  And Jimmy wanted  to go away immediately.  So the girl, you know,  wanted to use the bathroom, 
[01:23:30]  you know?  Oh.  So she got out,  didn't want to go use the bathroom,  pulled over to the side.  And I guess after she got done,  she came back over  like a stream that was there.  Uh-huh.  She jumped and slipped.  Oh.  And banged her head.  And I thought she was okay.  I'm waiting in the car.  Sure.  And then sure enough,  I looked out and I go,  my goodness,  what's going on here?  So, you know,  when I got in,  brought her back in the car  and took off,  went to Allentown  and called up the ambulance, bro. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was crazy, man.  What are the odds?  Freak accident, huh?  Oh, I was going nuts.  Oh, man.  What's she doing now?  Oh, that's right.  What happened?  Is it soapy?  What?  I don't know if she didn't make it.  She died not there, though.  No, no, no.  It wasn't there.  Next morning.  Next morning.  Oh, man, this is tragic.  And were you a suspect at all?  Wow.  Did they suspect you?  I had no idea.  Oh, they were asking me questions  and stuff like that, you know?  And I had to tell them the truth. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  I wanted that to sit there.  Jimmy wanted to clean up  that mess immediately.  I was so not expecting that.  That was Jimmy's...  John Walsh.  John Walsh.  John Walsh.  John Walsh.  Make it go away.  Make it go away.  Make it go away.  Your eyes.  Your eyes just bugged out.  Yeah, he turned and looked over like,  uh, what is he saying?  Hamada, hamada, hamada.  Ed Naughton.  So what are they doing?  They're reopening the case.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Well, a grand jury is going to review the case.  Well, they don't.  No need to make them sound better than they are.  Okay, brother.  Okay, brother.  Justice denied?  Well, yeah, the family of the woman who is dead,  they think that maybe there were some things ignored  during the initial investigation.  Oh.  One of those things being that they think Jimmy Snook had killed her.  Oh, that's a small detail.  Uh-huh.  All right, so.  Okay.  He'll probably, uh, go with his big finishing move.  The, uh. 
[01:25:30]  Superfly Splash.  Superfly Splash.  Right.  Does he still perform that?  No.  Is that how he killed her?  Oh, God.  You think he jumped off the top of the car like that?  Right.  Give her the Superfly Splash.  Is that her?  Okay, brother.  Oh, she's hot.  That's one of his daughters.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Give her the Superfly Splash right in her face.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Come.  There's the Superfly Splash.  Oh, yeah.  From the top of the cage.  Pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[01:26:00]  This is one of the best finishing moves ever.  That was a good one.  He would fly.  He would just fly.  He goes to the top of the cage, right?  That's right.  That's crazy.  Do you think this is a good move?  Is that Gorilla Monsoon?  It is.  Gorilla Monsoon one of the best.  Gorilla Monsoon.  He was great as a commentary for wrestling.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, man.  At the time, this was one of the coolest moves ever.  He was on top of the ropes.  Then people were screaming.  What's better than this?  They do a lot of this.  Look how fucking high up he is.  And he's got to make sure he lands perfect or he's going to crush the guy. 
[01:26:30]  Or break his own fucking head.  I don't think he cares.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  That's a good one.  That's a good one right there.  Looks like he landed on the rock down Morocco there.  Oh, shit.  That's it, huh?  30,000-plus scoring bananas here.  If you see, the wrestler tried to jump and he slipped and hit his head.  Oh, wait.  But you jumped on him, Jimmy.  Ah, that's right, brother.  What's a better move than that?  Jumping off the top rope and literally risking killing somebody with your knee in their chest. 
[01:27:00]  That's a good one.  I mean, they do that with...  Well, the Owen Hart move was pretty impressive.  Oh.  What?  It's an entrance.  Oh.  That was a hell of an entrance.  Oh, I'm sorry.  An accident.  Terrible.  Oh, my God.  And it was, you know...  But at least Vince did the right thing and he, you know, shut down WrestleMania that year.  Where are you getting that information?  Out of respect.  What?  First of all, it wasn't a WrestleMania for the record, but where are you getting that information?  Which one was it?  I don't even remember.  It wasn't a Royal Rumble.  No, the show was, I believe... 
[01:27:30]  Just a regular...  The show was called Over the Edge.  Over the Edge.  Oh, that's almost ironic.  Well, Owen certainly did not disappoint when he went over...  Over the Edge.  Over the Edge, right.  Yeah, yeah.  But Vince said, you know what?  It's not about the money and stuff.  We've got to shut this fucking thing down and get these people out of here.  I don't know where that information you're getting is coming from.  Shut her down!  That is...  The opposite happened, actually.  How long did they wait before they went on to the next match? 
[01:28:00]  Well, once the body was out of the ring.  As soon as the squeegee guy got out of the ring.  Owen Hart literally dies for Vince McMahon, and the guy can't even give it a few minutes  before the next match even starts?  Although there were a few minutes to, you know, get him out of the ring.  Anyone want to say a few words?  I don't think so.  Let's get back to the action.  You get the hell in there!  Yeah.  You clear that body out of here and get these matches going!  You're damn right we're continuing the night! 
[01:28:30]  Bob would have wanted it that way.  Who?  Owen?  Owen would have wanted it that way!  But can we at least clean up the blood on the mat?  It gives a good effect!  People say it's fake!  People are dying in this ring!  I remember watching the rest of that going, there's still blood in the ring.  They didn't even clean up the blood properly.  Don't pronounce him dead until he's outside the venue.  Right.  Like Disney.  Gives him plausible deniability. 
[01:29:00]  He actually died after the event.  Yeah.  My God!  Did they send, like, the EMS crews?  Were they big, burly guys?  They barely fit in the uniforms?  You know.  I know.  Because they're wrestlers.  Did Vince ever explain why he kept it going after Owen Hart got killed?  A lot of money.  He wanted to give the fans what they paid for.  I think they already got what they paid for.  Refund shmeefund. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  Clear them out!  What year was that?  1999.  No cell phone footage of that, right?  I guess people didn't have the phones?  No, there is no public footage of that.  There's no footage of that.  Well, there's no public footage.  It's somewhere.  I'm going to put it out on a DVD.  Have you seen it?  No, no.  I definitely have not.  They were able to make that clip go away for the most part?  A hundred percent they were able to make that clip go away.  Wow.  Well, in 99, the internet was still kind of figuring its shit out.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they must have gone into that TV truck immediately and gotten that tape. 
[01:30:00]  Vince just hitting the fucking equipment with an axe.  Yeah.  Vince, you didn't have to destroy the cameras.  That'll ruin me.  He skated, though.  He did.  Well, he didn't kill anybody.  What do you mean he skated?  Because he should have stopped the fucking pay-per-view.  Period.  That's what you do.  In show business, there's a saying, the show must go on.  This guy has more to this.  Jim in Philly, go ahead real fast.  What streets are they on?  Oh.  Hey, I hope you're there. 
[01:30:30]  First call, man.  I love you guys.  Of course you do.  What he filled his space up with while he was dead in the ring was an interview with  the British Bulldog, his brother-in-law.  And he had to keep the straight wrestling face while his brother-in-law is dying in the ring.  Didn't he kind of keep darting his eyes over or something?  I don't know.  What do you mean it's not true, Sam?  What happened, Sam?  You know.  I was incorrect.  Sam, is this caller an asshole?  Yes.  Why?  Call a turkey?  Because, ironically, while Owen Hart was dying in the ring, a pre-recorded Owen Hart promo 
[01:31:00]  was playing, and then the camera went to J.R., and then the camera went to a shot of the  audience.  Oh, my God!  Let's say hi to Bob in Kansas City.  Bob?  Hey, boys.  How are you doing real quick?  I was actually there with my friends and friends, and we saw him up on that kind of like  terrace walk around there, and I was like, what's going on?  Well, when he falls, I instantly grabbed the binoculars and take a look, and you could 
[01:31:30]  actually, he, like, hits the ring, goes down, and he's laying there.  It looks like he attempted to try to get up, and I think that's kind of when that bone  punctured through his heart.  He dropped the ring down.  They're totally acting like he's okay.  The rest of the paramedics in, and you could see them.  His arm just kept drooping as they were taking him, and they were like, oh, let's get this  back on the chest.  You know, everything's fine.  I think he'll be fine, King.  He looks perfectly fine, King.  He's just tired.  You think J.R. is making the medical call?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Wait, hold on. 
[01:32:00]  What punctured his heart?  His, you know, whatever the bone, like his main chest bone, I heard, went through his  aorta when he tried to get up there.  Jesus.  The sternum.  The sternum.  Is that the right term?  When he tried to get up?  The sternum.  That's my Greek name, Robin.  I am sternum.  Flavius Maximus sternum.  I'm a gladiator, Robin.  If the crowd was actually booing, like, it took about 15 minutes, and the crowd was 
[01:32:30]  booing to get everything going, it was ridiculous, because those of us that kind of were paying  attention, and you could tell the guy was fucking dead.  Right.  And the crowd was booing, and like you said, guys, come out, clean it up, let's get the  show on the road.  Unbelievable.  He was being lowered into the ring, and how high was he when he fell?  Top of the arena.  What actually broke?  The harness thing.  It didn't break the clip on.  It wasn't clipped on properly.  The clip was stuck on his cape.  He was wearing, like, a big blue blazer cape. 
[01:33:00]  So they thought it was clipped.  Well, it was clipped, and then he hit the release.  What do you mean?  Like, there's a release mechanism so that when he gets to the ring, he can immediately  be released from the cable.  Why would he hit that?  Because the cape was stuck in it.  So he went to pull the cape?  So I would assume that he didn't even pull the cape, that his hand knocked the cape.  Hit the cape, and that alone hit the release?  I wouldn't.  What a fucking...  You think he was trying to pull the cape loose or something and hit the release?  Probably.  Like the cape was all tangled up or something?  I believe so.  Capes are inconvenient for everybody. 
[01:33:30]  And how high is that?  50 feet, 60 feet?  Oh, more than that even.  Probably more than that, yeah.  I mean, it was the top of the...  Top of any, you know, large arena.  And he was being lowered from there.  Where did he land?  Could be 100 feet easily.  Yeah, right.  He landed in the ring.  Right in the middle of the ring, right?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Did people cheer?  Were they just, like, thinking it was a...  They knew there was a problem.  ...a work?  They pretty quick knew it was a problem, but it was also during the time when wrestling  was, like, fucking crazy.  Crazy!  So, like, every week something weird was happening.  Oh, they must have thought, like, oh, look. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, but how do you fake that?  I mean, at first they probably thought it was a dummy or something.  Like, they probably weren't expecting one of their favorite superstars.  Didn't J.R. have to announce it?  Yes.  He did.  During the event.  Later on, they did...  They announced that he was hurt.  He was going to the hospital.  Like, I regret it.  And I think they kind of knew.  Sure.  Do you have that clip of J.R. fucking announcing it?  Because it was weird.  It was like, oh, my God, he's dead.  Yeah, at this point, now that they officially know he's dead, I guess they're going to stop  it now.  No, we're still here. 
[01:34:30]  Don't go nowhere.  Right to the end.  Wow.  King, he's dead, King.  King, I don't know why.  That was a hell of a slobber knocker.  That's not what he said.  No?  No.  I thought that was how he said it.  Such bad taste.  It would have been...  Oh, here he goes.  So they did...  This was at least one to two matches removed from...  The event.  Right.  ...and actually falling.  Gotcha.  Let's see this.  But as soon as he fell, they announced that he had fallen.  Okay.  And said he was going to the hospital.  Do you have tape of that, too, or no?  I think he'll be fine.  Okay. 
[01:35:00]  And then...  Boy, this is bad.  This is bad.  Owen Hart was set to make an entrance from the ceiling, and he fell from the ceiling.  And I have the unfortunate responsibility to let everyone know that Owen Hart has died.  Oh, Jesus.  Why do the people laugh?  Why do they all laugh like that? 
[01:35:30]  That's not the audience.  That's terrible.  Was the audience hearing this or no?  No, they didn't.  So what did he say after that?  They say, well, now we're going to just cancel the rest of the matches, and we're all going  to go home and think about what just happened.  They went on to continue the show.  That's really weirdly...  How do you announce it and then do the...  And then do call...  Like, call of the match?  Yeah.  Oh, my God!  I think The Undertaker wrestled maybe Stone Cold or something like that.  Yeah.  And he came out with that ghoulish music, even?  I believe The Undertaker did wrestle in the main event. 
[01:36:00]  I believe.  I could be wrong.  Wouldn't that be great if The Undertaker was beating Stone Cold with Owen Hart's body?  Like, he's like, how could we capitalize on this?  Go in there and beat him with Owen's body.  Oh, terrible.  That's a really weird...  It's strange they went on.  That's a strange one, man.  There's no business like show business.  You've got to keep it going.  What did he say after that?  Is there more to the clip?  I would like to hear that.  Not really?  I want to see what they... 
[01:36:30]  I want to see how...  This is, like, right after it happened, into a Jeff Jarrett promo.  No, but go back to him announcing.  I want to see how it transitions back to the show.  Where is the actual fall?  It was never televised.  It was filmed, but not televised.  I mean, the hard cameras are always rolling.  But they were showing a pre-taped interview with him, Owen.  When?  And they were going to cut to his entrance.  He fell a little early. 
[01:37:00]  Like he was hanging, ready to be lowered.  Right, right.  So the fucking...  They were supposed to come back live and then show him lowering down after the taped piece.  Oh, I wonder if there was a camera rolling on him at that point at all.  Oh, I'm sure there were.  But, I mean, if he wasn't scheduled to come down, like, why would they be shooting when nothing was going on?  They have...  They save every...  I mean, they have copies of every camera.  Yeah, I'm sure they got the cameras ready.  They're ready to go, so...  Yeah, they save the masters.  Vince grabbed all that shit.  Do you think Vince still has it, or is it gone? 
[01:37:30]  Oh, he probably jerks off to us.  Oh, God.  That thing has the privacy of his own mansion.  My sex tapes.  Right.  Let me see the transition.  So he announces it where?  Right there?  I believe this is here.  Yeah.  Where are we?  I want to hear that he died, and then I want to just play it out from there.  And who are they...  I'm sorry.  Who are they announcing that, too, if this is not being televised?  The television aren't...  No, no, no.  This is on pay-per-view.  No, it is.  Him falling wasn't telling us.  But him falling wasn't telling us.  Right, because it happened when it wasn't supposed to happen. 
[01:38:00]  That's okay.  I thought you meant the whole...  They were airing a promo, and then they went back to live.  And they were going to go live, and then he was going to make his entrance.  Okay.  But he fell as they were playing the tape piece.  Yeah, no, this was a big pay-per-view event.  Right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  So this is, I believe, right after a Mankind match.  Here in Kansas City, tragedy befell the World Wrestling Federation and all of us.  Owen Hart was set to make an entrance from the ceiling.  Clowns behind him. 
[01:38:30]  And he fell for the ceiling.  Yeah, they don't know that.  And I have the unfortunate responsibility to let everyone know that Owen Hart has died.  Owen Hart has tragically died from that accident.  I'm watching this and thinking, this is such bullshit.  It's a work.  Well, they go to a long shot of the ring.  And I'm just going to let it sit there, huh?  But how does the audience know? 
[01:39:00]  The audience doesn't.  Yeah, then I can tell the audience.  Okay.  They want the audience to keep their energy up.  So what do they do now after they say that?  That's what I'll, and then they went back into the podium.  I would assume that they would air a package of some sort, whether it be of a feud or something.  I kind of remember there wasn't any real calls of those matches after that.  Like, even for the pay-per-view audience, they weren't there going, oh my god, he's out.  I kind of remember it just being, like, there. 
[01:39:30]  Somber.  Yeah.  They were friends, I'm sure.  It's like, not so many of your friends died having to call a match.  It's fucking kind of...  Some of the wrestlers were coming out in tears.  Like, they were walking down the aisle.  So that's how...  Really?  Yes, that's how twisted Vince is.  At that point, you go, all right, goddammit.  I want you to take a good long look at this lump of shit.  Bag him and tag him.  It's fucking Sergeant Barnes.  No one wanted to continue, but they were all scared of Vince McMahon. 
[01:40:00]  You think J.R. wanted to continue announcing matches?  Nah, probably not.  I'm sure Vince yelled at him in his ear.  This is the Undertaker's entrance after that it happened.  Oh.  And the Undertaker knew, obviously, they all knew everybody.  Why wasn't the Undertaker working on Owen?  Did he look upset when he comes in?  Make it bigger, Sam, so I can see it.  Almost shocking to hear the overwhelming booze for that man.  Jim Norton?  Yes, he is.  Oh, that's funny. 
[01:40:30]  He is colder than a mother-in-law's embrace.  Oh, that's funny.  Is that the same guy?  Make it bigger, WWF champion.  Weird, right?  It's shit.  You can hear it in his voice.  Yeah.  He's not as...  No, he's trying really hard, but he's not into that.  The fact that they would do this is, to me, really...  You can see the blood in the ring still.  There's something shitty about the organization.  There was.  The big blood stain was still in the ring.  In the ring, on the other side of the ring.  I think they all avoided that part of the fucking ring. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And I know the shots that go on, and it's a weird thing in a sport.  If a player gets hurt, they don't stop the football game.  Like, I do get that.  So...  They're rolling around in dried-up Owen parts blood.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't get it at all.  Yes.  I want to...  No, I mean, I get the fact that a football game...  If a guy died on a football game, they wouldn't stop the game.  He'd be in the hospital.  They'd make the announcement, and the teams would play.  If a guy died during an NFL game...  They'd pull him out.  They would take him out, because they wouldn't, you know... 
[01:41:30]  There's no way.  The players would not have it.  They would say, we're not fucking playing anymore.  Yeah.  I highly doubt they would do that, Jerry.  I think they would finish.  They would do it for him.  I don't think so, because it's real shit.  This is fake shit.  But there's still...  Someone dies on the football field during an NFL game.  There's no way they continue.  Can you imagine the shit they would get for that?  Goddamn death dedication.  I think they would.  I think they would.  I don't see them...  Because that thing has never happened, so we don't know. 
[01:42:00]  It's happened once.  Has it?  What happened?  Yes.  It happened in 71.  Chuck Hughes.  Chuck Hughes.  Oh, my uncle Chuck, right?  It was my uncle.  Yeah, I remember that guy.  What'd they do?  He had a heart attack during the final minutes of the game.  Bears against the Lions in Detroit.  The Bears!  Initially, some thought he was faking the injury to stop the clock.  But when Dick Butkus frantically signaled to help on the field, it was obvious he was  in serious trouble.  And the game was finished in near silence.  Well, there you go, Jimmy. 
[01:42:30]  But it's 71.  Yeah.  He had to die in that dumb costume.  Oh, the fucking...  Is that right before?  Yes.  This was running pre-taped right before.  It probably wasn't taped that minute, though.  No, it was taped that, you know, an hour before, half an hour before.  Supposedly, McMahon gave the death tape to the Hart family and they destroyed us.  Someone was trying to tell us.  Really?  That's possible.  I mean, they sued him.  I think it's evidence.  Valuable evidence.  Yeah, someone said it was played at the lawsuit. 
[01:43:00]  That's possible.  Yeah, I would think so.  They sued him.  That tape has to exist somewhere.  Oh, there's other copies.  I'm sure.  Why would they destroy it?  I mean, maybe, I guess, by the way.  Yeah, I mean, but it's nowhere.  No one's seen it.  You don't want it.  All right, we've got to take a break.  When we get back, we're going to talk about stuff that happened in 2001 next.  Yeah, we're working our way up to this decade.  This is the Cod.  The Cod.  Tim Florentine is joining us next.  We've got Super Bowl food.  We've got two great masturbation stories. 
[01:43:30]  We've got an opera singer farting.  Stay there.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man?  You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  I'm just...  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right?  You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  What?  Yeah, I don't fucking...  What the fuck do I care? 
[01:44:00]  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What?  Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo, the trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  Now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha!  Yeah!  Fucking...  Where's Gary?  Fuck him.  Laugh, love, and learn.  You're not going to drink today, right? 
[01:44:30]  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week, on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Fuck you, I'm fine.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  You can put your penis away, miss.  I watch the rain and it does red.  Give me more and I don't need it. 
[01:45:00]  Everything coming from that room today is on the low side.  I am?  Mr. Travis.  I don't know if we'll...  It's got to be something on your board.  I'm not doing anything different here.  Oh, shit!  He just called you an asshole.  Yeah, I'm going to say operator error.  You know what?  You fucking mushroom stamped me.  Because look what I do now.  There it is.  Fucking grab me a board winning song.  I just got mushroom stamped.  He was right.  Travis, absolutely right.  On your end. 
[01:45:30]  Why are we playing this?  Just because it's a cool song?  Why not?  All right.  I like the why nots.  Jim Florentine.  My God.  Hi, Jim.  What's going on, boys?  Want some chocolate?  No.  I'm not four years old.  I want chocolate.  I'll bring it home for my son who's three and a half.  You don't treat yourself to chocolate?  No, not no.  No, why?  I treat myself to submityourxgirlfriend.com.  That's how I submit myself. 
[01:46:00]  Treat myself.  You're a grown man.  You shouldn't be eating chocolate anymore.  Seriously.  I'm not eating chocolate.  If you're at a party, it's like, all right.  Or there's a fucking dessert at the end of dinner.  I don't think of a little piece.  What have we got here?  Yeah.  But you shouldn't search it out ever.  No.  Me and my wife went to dinner the other night, and the guy's like, dessert anybody?  And I'm not even looking at the waiter.  My wife knows I don't eat dessert.  Right.  And she's like, what do you think I should get?  He brings the whole plate out, and I'm just staring.  I'm not even looking.  Yeah.  The guy's like, sir, what do you think?  And I go, about what?  I think the Broncos are going to win.  He's like, no, I ask about the soup bowls. 
[01:46:30]  I ask about dessert.  I go, I'm a grown man, sir.  You think desserts are just for children?  Yeah, it's for children.  Yeah.  It's for children and chicks.  And then if it's there, it's like, if you're at a, you know.  But you don't go, ooh, this all looks so good.  Let me get the dessert menu.  You were never a dessert guy?  No.  And if you're drinking, too, it fucks up your buzz.  It does fuck up your buzz.  You have a few bottles of wine, you know, a couple glasses of wine at dinner, a couple beers.  That's true.  I don't want to mix in fucking cheesecake.  I'll just get, like, an espresso with a side of Zambuca.  And then I'll down that.  And by side, he means bottle. 
[01:47:00]  Wow, we're learning something about Florentine today.  Yeah.  Now he's made us all feel guilty because of some chocolate in front of us.  I had one little bite of the seesaw thing, and that was...  Yeah, go ahead, Jim.  Go ahead, Jim.  Look, I just had Judas Priest on my, cranking my car so you can make fun of me on that.  Like, are you serious?  I am.  That's all right.  What do you think of Motley Crue saying they're going away?  Well, they signed a contract.  With who?  I don't know.  Like, we can take a break, that.  Like, who's going to... 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, if they all decide, well, we want a tour again, well, we just signed that deal.  Well, if we all agree to rip up the contract...  Yeah, yeah.  They're saying no one's going to use the name after this latest tour is over.  They're going to go on, what, 72 dates.  And they're saying goodbye, and they're never reuniting after that.  That's bullshit.  They don't want, like, a guitar tech going out with a bunch of guys and calling it Motley Crue.  Well, they don't want Vince doing it, because Vince does a lot of solo dates on his own.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  He'll play in the...  Motley Crue will play, you know, at the Beacon, and Vince will play across the street the next 
[01:48:00]  night with a solo band.  He doesn't give a shit.  What a scum.  Yeah, he does his own thing.  He doesn't...  Wait, right after he sings at Motley Crue?  Pretty much, yeah.  Well, maybe a month later, he'll go right back to the market with a solo band to do all the Motley  songs.  Let me ask you this.  So, a year goes by, they're retired, and then, let's say the Super Bowl goes, we want  you for the halftime show.  You're telling me they're not going to reunite?  The thing is, with those hard rock and metal bands, in five years, there's going to be no  more Priest, no more Sabbath, no more Motorhead.  ACDC.  No more ACDC, no more Maiden. 
[01:48:30]  All those bands are going to be gone.  The only two that are going to be left, hard rock and metal arena bands, are going to be  Motley and Metallica.  Right.  So, you're telling me...  Kiss will be around in five years.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they will be.  And, you know, Paul's like 63, 64.  That's true.  Yeah.  No, I think you're right.  Let's take Kiss, maybe throw Kiss in the mix.  Don't you think...  These big festivals are going to need a band like that, one of these bands, you know,  so they're going to go, hey, there's 30 million on the table to do 90 days in the summer and 
[01:49:00]  some European dates, three years after they retire.  They're going to be about 60.  Right.  The guys in Motley in 10 years or so, 62, they're going to do it.  It's not a brave move.  They needed to do this to get their ticket sales up, obviously.  Yeah, and they got Alice Cooper opening, which is a good opening act.  Right.  But, you know, if things change and there's actual money, more money to be made, of course  they're going to continue.  In five years, if there's 30 million guaranteed on the table to go do 90 dates.  And they have the press conference with the tombstones on the stage.  Did you see that?  A tombstone for each guy with rest in peace. 
[01:49:30]  How did you see that?  That's pretty impressive that all these bands are still going now.  I like Mila Crew, too, but...  They're all going for, like, fucking pre-Sabbath, kid...  Like, the fact that all these bands are still actively touring is fucking amazing.  Well, they know there's huge money in it because there's not any up-and-coming bands that  could do arenas.  There's a few out there.  There's a band called Events Sevenfold, Five Finger Death Punch, but a lot of bands...  Can they do arenas?  They're Foo Fighters, huh?  Can they do arenas?  Five Finger Death Punch?  They're close.  They do about 10,000, I'd say. 
[01:50:00]  Events Sevenfold is pretty much doing arenas.  Those are the only two.  And, you know, Foo Fighters is more like a hard rock band.  They can do arenas.  But other than that, there's nobody.  What did you think of Metallica at the Grammys?  I didn't see it.  I didn't watch one second at the Grammys.  I wanted to see the Sabbath thing, but I saw it online, so...  Well, the Sabbath thing was not on the Grammys.  Right, but I guess they introed something.  Intro to Ringo, yeah.  Ozzy tripped a little bit.  Ozzy tripped a little bit.  You're being kind.  Of course.  Just a little tripped.  A little.  That's something Ozzy and I have in common.  We're not good at introducing our heroes. 
[01:50:30]  We get nervous.  Yeah, well, his teleprompter's all over.  You walk out there.  I guess he read somebody else's line or something.  And then Geezer starts just laughing at him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a good moment, but a little he tripped off, huh?  Just a little mistake.  Just a little mistake.  They were laughing about it the next day.  Oh, you talked to him about it?  Yeah, before the interview, we talked about it.  During the interview, Geezer mentioned it.  Who am I, fucking Ed McMahon?  I don't like fucking TV.  Oh, is that what he said?  Yeah, he wasn't.  It was really...  He's like, every time I've talked to him in the last few years, he's gotten more and 
[01:51:00]  more...  Anyone who thinks Ozzy's out of it, not even a little.  We were talking about all their albums, and he's fucking spitting out lyrics from 1973  that he hasn't sung on stage, probably.  71 from Master Reality.  Well, if you watch the show, The Osbournes, you realize, like, he's not the script guy,  the guy that comes up and introduces a band fluidly.  Yeah.  He was like a clusterfuck on that show, and it was great.  Right.  That's exactly what it was.  I don't like fucking TV.  Fair enough. 
[01:51:30]  There's something...  No, man.  There's a hitch.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, okay.  I don't know if it's...  Is it something from yesterday, or is it something from a year ago?  No.  No, it's something from the forceps.  Okay.  We'll figure it out.  Jim, we got some food coming in, too, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, we're going to be trying out some Super Bowl food.  Yeah, Roland was telling me about that.  Oh, I'm sure Roland was.  For us, there's love when we do our food break, so...  He was showing me the website and what they want.  Oh, yeah.  Roland's on a diet, so he could eat as much of it as he wants, apparently. 
[01:52:00]  I don't know how his diet works.  He's on a very strict diet, so he'll be eating as much as he wants until he gets completely full.  I don't know how it works.  We don't understand, but he is losing weight, so...  Yes, yes.  What do you think of this Super Bowl, Jim Florentine?  Is it a bust that they decided to do it in a cold-weather stadium?  I think it's definitely hurting ticket sales.  They've plummeted.  It's sold out, though, right?  But it's more hurting the scalpers?  Right, yeah.  You know, tickets, they're down like 60% over the last week.  People realize it's going to be cold. 
[01:52:30]  They don't want to sit out there.  It's going to be a pain in the ass to get there.  They want everybody in their seats by like 4 o'clock.  Wow.  And kickoff's not until 6.30.  Oh, my God.  Really?  So you're basically going to be sitting in your seats for six and a half hours.  The game will probably end around 10.30.  What happens between 4 and 6.30 if you're at the stadium?  I mean, on TV, it's kind of cool.  Right.  That's what they always do with Super Bowls.  They want you in there way early because you've got to go through security.  You're not allowed to tailgate.  Why?  No tailgate?  Yeah, because of terrorism.  Is someone going to fucking put a bomb in a sausage?  Terrorist?  Tailgate? 
[01:53:00]  What are they talking about?  Yeah, I know.  A bomb in a sausage.  Seriously, is that what's going to happen?  Right.  No, I'll tell you what it is.  They want all the stuff bought inside.  That's true.  It's all for fucking sales inside the arena.  They haven't done this any other time in a Super Bowl with the tailgating.  But this time, they've stayed for security reasons.  But the stadium's in the middle of nowhere.  And the stadium's in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Especially where that raceway is, where the track is, like a mile away.  You could park over there and fucking fire up a grill.  I'm sure.  They just fuck everything up. 
[01:53:30]  Yep.  You have to be dropped off, too.  You can't walk to the Super Bowl, like if you live around the corner.  Some people walk to the game.  And it's $150 for a shuttle bus from New York.  Holy shit.  Per person?  Yeah.  It's $150.  You can't walk.  You have to be dropped off.  It's a whole...  Yeah.  How do they know if you're walking?  I guess...  I don't know.  I don't know how to...  They're going to see some guy on the fucking highway on Route 3 and go...  You can't walk in any foot traffic.  I have opportunities to go, but it just sounds like it's going to be a really long day. 
[01:54:00]  Like fucking 90-inch TV, my house, beers, fucking food, people over.  Jerking each other off.  We'll just be jacking.  I'll be fucking nailing Jimmy in the ass.  It'll be fucking great.  Jesus Christ.  And then the line to get in.  You know, the security line to get in.  They're going to be checking everybody.  They can stay home.  We can watch the commercials.  Oh, the commercials.  Do you like the commercials?  Do you like a good Super Bowl commercial?  I'm just having like a family over.  And I sent an email out to anyone who wants to come over with a family.  I go, by the way, if you're looking forward to watching a Super Bowl commercial, so I'm 
[01:54:30]  putting it on mute.  If you don't like it, go to another fucking party.  That was my email.  Putting it on mute.  Yeah, I held the remote the whole time.  I hit right mute.  You're not hearing these.  What a scrooge.  No, it's not fucking fun.  I got a lot of money on the game.  I don't want to fucking try to laugh at a Doritos commercial when I'm down fucking 400  bucks.  You don't think they're good commercials?  No.  They're fucking terrible.  You're not going to be talking about the commercials the next day?  No, not at all.  The Budweiser one was especially good this year?  I don't want to see a fucking three-minute Pepsi commercial with Beyonce fucking dancing 
[01:55:00]  with 75 people.  It's not going to make me drink a Pepsi.  I haven't drank one in fucking 15 years.  The Super Bowl is weird because these guys bust their balls all year long, and then the  game itself is almost secondary to all the nonsense around it.  Nonsense, yeah.  Yeah, and then the half-hour halftime shows up.  Half-hour?  It's usually only 12 minutes, so that fucks them up.  You don't have to wait a half-hour in a locker room.  It's at least a half-hour, too.  I think they've been stretching that, it seems like, over the years, no? 
[01:55:30]  A little stretch on that?  No, it's 30.  30 right on the nose?  Yeah.  They've got that fucking Bruno Sammartino playing.  Bruno Sammartino.  I'd rather see Bruno Sammartino sing fucking old Italian songs.  I'd rather see Bruno Sammartino sing fucking old Italian songs than Bruno Mars.  That's fucking awful.  Well, he's getting the Chili Peppers because he knows nobody wants to watch them.  He knows he's got to pump it up.  Yeah.  So he's going to have them behind him or something?  Yeah.  They'll come out and run around.  The Chili Peppers are good live.  They fucking run around like maniacs.  You think they'll do something wild and outrageous that'll make the news and make people outraged? 
[01:56:00]  No, I'm sure they had to get approved.  Because Flea used to come out naked or play in his tighty-whities.  No, a sock on his dick.  Yeah.  A sock on his cock and fucking...  I always thought that was impressive, though.  How do you keep the sock on the whole time?  I've tried to pull it over your balls.  I've tried it a few times at home.  It doesn't stay on.  You need a good elastic.  No.  And that was your son's sock.  It wouldn't stay on.  Yeah, you can't have those socks with the elastic all in.  You've got to get brand new socks that aren't stretched out by your cabs yet. 
[01:56:30]  See, there you go.  Pull it over his ball sack.  Yeah, a hairy, dumb fucking ball bag.  Ball bag, that's his pubis.  Yeah, that's his pubis.  That's Anthony Kiedis' pubis.  Yeah, I don't know.  Do you think the Broncos got this?  Yeah.  No doubt?  Broncos?  Well, look, the NFL wants the Broncos to win.  Oh, fuck yeah.  They want Peyton Manning.  It's a good story.  It's a great story.  So, you know, the Seahawks are almost like the bad guys with Richard Sherman.  Right.  You know, so, look, they're not going to fix the game, but you watch some of those calls. 
[01:57:00]  Questionable calls are all going to go to Broncos.  Wow.  Who do you think it's going to win?  Whether it be a fake fucking holding on Wes Welker on a third and 15 when there was no  holding, they're going to throw a flag, keep it going or whatever.  A late hit on Peyton Manning that wasn't.  Wow.  Yeah, so they're going to get every call.  Just little calls.  Wow.  And, yeah, the Broncos will definitely win.  You want them?  No, I want the Seahawks.  I want the Seahawks, too.  Yeah.  I want Peyton Manning to go home, cry, and stop doing fucking Papa John commercials.  It fucking stinks.  Nobody eats that pizza. 
[01:57:30]  They're terrible.  Besides some 20-year-old kid in college that stoned at 2 in the morning.  But he's hilarious.  Nobody eats that shit.  He's hilarious when he does his commercials.  Oh, they are funny.  They're really a lot of fun.  They're funny commercials.  Yeah, they're great, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in the back of the kitchen.  He's tossing the door up in the air.  What are you doing?  You said to toss the dough because he's throwing it like a football.  You get it?  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  You told me to toss the dough.  I get it.  Papa John.  Chip likes it.  Chip thinks it's hilarious.  Papa John stinks.  It's terrible.  I'm not saying the pizza.  The pizza is the guy. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, the moonwalking.  It stinks.  Oh, yeah.  There's a new commercial where they're moonwalking.  Yeah, Sean.  Sean's moonwalking.  Like, it's 1984.  They go back in time.  They do.  And they're doing, like, the safety dance and Papa John's moonwalking.  You haven't seen that one, Jim?  That's great.  Here it is.  It's great.  It's fun for everybody.  They get bigger, Sam.  I'll still get it.  It's great.  Let's go back to where better ingredients, better pizza.  Let's make up this guy.  Road trip.  How many facelifts has Papa John had?  Road trip.  Wow.  1984.  Let's celebrate. 
[01:58:30]  Celebrate 30 years of Papa John.  Get a large one-topic pizza for just 30 cents.  Wow.  1984.  When you buy a pizza and regular menu price, 30-cent pizza.  Now, that's pretty cool.  This looks cool.  No.  That's just wrong.  Stick to better ingredients.  There we go.  Opie liked that.  Opie really liked that.  Isn't that great, Jim?  Stick to better ingredients than what?  The shit that you've been putting in that pizza?  Yeah, he just admits...  It has to be better.  If you fucking took a shit on a Papa John's pizza, that would be better ingredients. 
[01:59:00]  Better ingredients.  He admitted that the ingredients were better 30 years ago.  Do you like when they said road trip?  Yeah, road trip.  Road trip.  I feel like it's 1984.  Why?  Why do they use Peyton Manning in all these commercials?  I don't get it.  He's a stiff.  He's a goober.  He's a stiff.  He's middle America perfect.  He's not good looking.  He's a blockhead.  Yeah.  So it's perfect.  You know, Tom Brady, everyone gets mad because he's a good looking dude.  He's married to a supermodel. 
[01:59:30]  So people don't want to see him.  But Peyton Manning, he's non-threatening to everybody.  No guy's chick wants to fuck Peyton Manning.  They don't want to fuck Tom Brady.  So that's why.  You didn't like the moonwalk?  Ugh.  Ugh.  I feel like it's 1984.  How, Peyton?  You're fucking...  You've got a quarter head of hair left.  In 1984, you had a full head.  You got six surgeries on your neck.  It's not 1984.  You were fucking 17 then. 
[02:00:00]  How the fuck does he come back from neck surgery?  That is a great story.  Well, Joe Rogan, when he was on the show, told you about that blood spinning thing.  He did the spinning thing?  Yeah.  And Dice just said he had it done on his...  He had rotator cuff surgery.  Did he?  And he had the blood spinning thing.  He said, like, three weeks he was back in the gym, which would usually take, like, nine months.  I just went down on a chick when she had a period.  That's all I need.  Oh, you're bugging people out about your thoughts on the game.  I think we've got another gambler on the line.  Scott in New York.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:00:30]  Hey.  So, Jim, do you really think that the Denver is going to win because the NFL wants them  to win?  Like, all these silly calls are going to happen?  That sounds just retarded.  Well, look, I said they're not getting together.  Goodell's not sitting with the referees going, hey, look, let's do this, you know, let's make  sure the Broncos win.  But the refs love Peyton Manning.  Russell Wilson, it's his second year in the league.  They're like, ah, he's got plenty of time to win another Super Bowl.  If there's a questionable call, it's going the Broncos' way, without a doubt.  Well, I guess we'll see, huh?  I believe that shit happens. 
[02:01:00]  It might even be subconsciously.  It is.  Brady, you just get a call.  Troy Aikman always got calls.  Subconsciously from the referees, that just makes you want to...  I know it sounds ludicrous, but I really believe that shit does end up happening in sports.  When you see Brady or Peyton Manning bitching that they got hit, like a low hit or a late  hit, and then all of a sudden the flag comes fucking 15 seconds later, they're the big  star quarterbacks.  Of course they're going to get that call.  Well, they want him on the field.  Who's Peyton Manning's backup?  That fucking...  I forget.  I don't even know his name.  You want him in there? 
[02:01:30]  I couldn't even say his name.  Yeah.  I think it's on purpose.  I think they actually have a meeting beforehand and discuss it and make videotapes of them  saying that they're going to make the calls that way.  That'd be great.  I don't know if they do that.  Oh, Jimmy.  Peyton Manning owns 20 Papa John's.  That's why he's on those commercials?  Yeah.  He's a franchise owner?  I get it.  I hate him.  Fuck.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right, Scott.  Wow.  I understand what Florentine's saying.  It's not a big conspiracy.  It's not.  They're not getting together.  I understand what it's saying.  But the refs know, hey, man, Peyton Manning's a good dude. 
[02:02:00]  You know, look, he's great for the league, Peyton Manning.  Right.  He's an amazing quarterback, without a doubt.  I just don't like his commercials, and I don't want him to the second Super Bowl.  Fucking commercials.  Yeah.  I think they're pretty funny, though.  Road trip.  That's how guys talk.  It's real guy talk.  Yeah, because we drive around a lot.  Yeah, we go, doesn't it feel like 1984?  Yeah.  Road trip.  Well, if you can find safety dance on the radio, it makes you feel like it's 1984.  I like the safety dance.  I enjoy good safety dance.  80s on 8.  That's all you need to put on.  Sirius XM's 80s on 8. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, it's fun music.  It is fun music.  You'll get the fucking safety dance.  You're talking to the wrong guys.  We like a little chocolate, and we like our 80s on 8.  We like a little fun music.  It's not fun.  We like a little Kajuku.  Are you getting blown while the safety dance is on?  That's kind of fun.  Okay.  Just kind of fun.  While eating chocolates?  I like a good chocolate caramel truffle while I listen to, you know, fucking We Belong  to the Night, We Belong to Each Other.  Anthony likes about that one.  Anthony likes chocolate on everything but a neighbor. 
[02:03:00]  That's it for the Super Bowl.  There you go.  That's all we need to know.  I don't know.  I think the people coming to New York for the Super Bowl are bummed out that it's so  fucking cold.  I think it would help if you had like a, you know, an ACDC or a Van Halen or a Metallica  playing a halftime show.  Yeah.  Stop pandering to the crowd that never watches football.  Metallica.  How great would that be?  Metallica would be amazing.  Everybody knows their songs.  They would do one.  They would do, you know, Enter Sandman and something else. 
[02:03:30]  Maybe Master of Puppets or something.  Everybody knows their songs.  They're officially mainstream too, you know.  Absolutely.  Well, it's all for the, you know, it's always to get the people at home watching for that  half hour or so.  That's all it is.  Bruno Mars will get people to watch.  You know what I mean?  They don't care about the people in the arena.  Bruno Mars.  But I mean, that's why they're doing it.  Seems like a weird choice.  It is because the only people like Bruno Mars are like, they're like hipsters and fucking,  you know.  Hipsters and nerds.  And you already got them watching because they're playing fantasy football.  Those are the fucking, those are the assholes playing fantasy football.  So you already got them watching. 
[02:04:00]  I can almost see a Beyonce and a Madonna in the last couple of years.  You want chicks to watch.  Which they watched for like two seconds and walked away from the TV because they got jealous  of how good they look.  And they don't look like that.  Beyonce just had a baby three weeks before the Super Bowl last year and then she looked  amazing.  So all the chicks got jealous and walked away from the TV.  Right.  And went back in the kitchen and felt sorry for themselves.  And ate fucking more chocolate.  But if I had seven trainers, I could look like that.  No, you wouldn't.  As a reading chocolate.  No, you wouldn't.  Right.  You got it.  You could put the chocolate down right now. 
[02:04:30]  It has nothing to do with a trainer.  That's so true.  Yeah, I know.  So they're not really watching it at all.  Madonna, which, oh, she's a grandmother or whatever.  She's in her 50s.  She shouldn't be dressed like that.  Right.  That's what went on the year before.  Right.  So it's just fucking women bitches.  If I had my own nutritionist, I would look like that too.  Yeah, exactly.  No, in the end, you've got to make sure you don't eat the fucking chocolate that is sitting  in front of us right now.  Yeah, if Jim Norton can do it and be disciplined.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Pretty impressive.  I talked to his trainer. 
[02:05:00]  She said he's very disciplined.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy dives right in.  When he gets an obsession going, then this is a good one.  Yeah.  You know, it can work out now.  I trained yesterday.  Nice little training session.  But he's been taking a little taste here and there today.  I took one little bite and that was it.  Oh, man.  And I had some 100 calorie Dr. Ian popcorn.  And what about the Super Bowl food that's going to come in?  I'll have a few bites, but yeah, I've been pretty good.  Oh, I'll indulge a little.  I may pick a little just to celebrate the week.  I did have a dessert the other night, though. 
[02:05:30]  It was like we went out and we bumped into Dana White in the fucking lobby of the hotel.  We didn't plan it.  They just invited us out to eat.  And then he's like, yeah, get desserts.  And he missed out a few bites.  I rediscovered Oreo cookies recently.  Fuck.  You like Oreo cookies at least?  I can't remember.  No desserts.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  Last time I had an Oreo cookie was when I was nine.  I can't remember if I like them or not.  You are disciplined.  It's not disciplined.  It's just, you know.  You just never liked it, I guess.  It's a hit shit.  You got a food thing? 
[02:06:00]  Popcorn.  No, I mean, do you like eat normally?  Oh, yes.  Like Sam doesn't eat well at all.  Jim likes frosting.  Jim likes frosting, but I was trying to come up with a blowjob joke, but I just fell apart.  It was too easy and too dumb.  Oh, man.  The Super Bowl food has arrived.  It's exactly what distracted me.  Should we take a little break so they can set up?  The listeners love this.  They love this.  Listeners, hold on to your hats.  We got a plug for Florentine real quick.  Yeah, Jim, what are you promoting today?  I will be in Atlantic City.  Not you. 
[02:06:30]  He said, Jim.  All right.  I have one show left.  The fucking Borgata show.  February 15th.  The other two are sold out.  Nice.  D.C., I think early show Friday is sold.  Both shows Saturday are sold.  So there's late show Friday and Thursday.  It's all going to sell out.  And then February 28th, Pittsburgh, Munn Hall, Pennsylvania, Carnegie Music Hall.  Very cool.  And Florentine, where are you going to be, brother?  This weekend at Magoobie's Joke House, Timoney in Maryland.  That place is great.  Yeah, it's a great room.  That's a really good club.  Tomorrow through Saturday.  And then that metal show to Saturday, a brand new episode. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, congratulations.  And what season are you up to?  13.  No.  Well, we've been on the air for five years.  Wow.  Good for you.  So we're at about like 120 episodes.  Are you running out of things to talk about?  No, there's always different guys to come on.  There's always something going on.  Yes, yeah.  And my trainer is the girl on his show.  She's really good, man.  Jennifer, yeah.  She's very attractive.  And then, yeah, next week I'm also going to be down in Florida, West Palm Beach, Thursday, February 6th.  And then Miami and Fort Pierce, all on JimFlorentine.com. 
[02:07:30]  Good for you.  We're going to talk more Super Bowl.  And we've got a couple good masturbation stories in the news.  Beautiful.  Two great ones, actually.  Did you see the naked dude in Philly?  I didn't see the video.  I just saw the story.  Oh, fucked up.  He cray.  He's cray-cray.  Ah, yeah, this is for Florentine.  A little safety dance for you, Jim.  Jim Florentine has joined us today.  Leave your lungs if you want to. 
[02:08:00]  Leave your world behind.  Not the 80s.  I was into this music at this time because I grew up on Metalhead and I wasn't getting laid listening to a priest.  That's true.  Maiden and going to parties and all that stuff.  And no chicks wanted anything to do with that.  They were scared, right?  So I went into like New Wave for a little while.  I would hang out at like New Wave clubs and try to dance.  Wow.  Were you all going?  Yes, I needed to get pussy.  Yeah.  I wasn't getting anything.  I'd fucking go to like a party.  I'd be like, Halford might be leaving priest and chicks would just run away from me. 
[02:08:30]  So then I had a note of safety dance and that shit.  All right.  Thomas Dolby and all that crap.  Did you put the safety pins on your jacket?  No, but I wore those goofy shirts.  Those stuff.  Halford might be leaving priest.  What?  Halford might be leaving priest.  What a funny thing this is to say to a chick.  A chick would give a shit.  Halford might be leaving.  Wouldn't even care.  And now I'm also confused by Roland's diet again.  We're all confused by Roland's. 
[02:09:00]  Eat whatever you want.  What did he just say?  He's on his diet.  I am going to have some brisket.  The Super Bowl food is about to enter the studio.  So please, don't go anywhere, people.  You might have to hang out in your driveway before you head into work or whatever.  And Roland was saying there's some brisket coming in.  And I go, is that on your diet?  He said, yes.  How is brisket on your diet?  How is brisket on your diet?  Because, gentlemen, it's a meat. 
[02:09:30]  It's like a steak.  So brisket but no sauce, please.  See, the sugar.  I understand cutting down sugars and grains.  But I don't believe that you can eat anything you want as long as there's no sugar and grains.  I know that you can lose weight in there.  It's in the book.  I'm so excited.  This goes against Dr. Ian Smith's diet.  I don't believe this.  Dr. Ian's book is under fiction.  See, I would think fiction would be the book that says you could eat anything you want.  Exactly.  That book, I believe, is called The Bible.  Yes, that's my Bible.  It's your Bible.  It says gays shouldn't lay together. 
[02:10:00]  I think he's doing more of a thing where no carbs.  Right.  So he's just going with the whole protein.  And no chocolate.  But he's going to crash.  Yeah, yeah.  What happens with those diets?  He's going to start eating carbs again.  He's going to crash.  It'll last for like four or five days.  And then all of a sudden, he's going to...  Or more.  Two weeks.  Huh?  Two weeks.  But yeah, you have to start eating carbs at one point.  You need the carbs for energy and stuff like that, too.  To fuel you for the rest of the day.  Well, I'm fueled.  I'm ready for it.  Fuel you.  I'm fueled.  I was in the office for 23 minutes.  He fell asleep seven times. 
[02:10:30]  You have no fuel in your body whatsoever.  He fucking kept conking out.  I was trying to take a picture of him, but he kept waking up.  I'm like, how the fuck is he?  Because he's aware that he sleeps for like six seconds, and he's back up.  Because he's aware everyone's trying to get a picture of him snoring, because it's amazing  to watch.  Have you ever seen him sleep leaning all the way over?  He leans all the way over at movies.  It's unbelievable.  He could sleep anywhere.  At that moment, I was on E.  What?  I was on E, but now I'm good again.  Oh, E isn't empty. 
[02:11:00]  So how did you fill up?  Coffee.  Come back again.  You don't think he has good fucking energy, Jim?  No, he doesn't.  You need carbs for that.  But he just drank your coffee.  Because the coffee's going to make him crash, too, every hour, hour and a half, too.  All right.  Should we bring the Super Bowl food in?  Yeah.  Listeners, here it comes.  This is what you always enjoy when we eat on the air and comment on how good the food  is.  This is what you asked for.  That's right.  We're only giving you what you want.  That's right.  Dog shit break coming up.  Have you guys ever done where someone's given you guys food and brought it in and you guys 
[02:11:30]  said, it sucks.  This is terrible?  We've lied a few times.  Yes.  There has been some suckiness.  There has been?  Yeah.  For the most part, I think it's...  I can't remember what it was.  You do all right.  There was something that was so dry and terrible.  My teeth.  Yeah.  It was Edgar's teeth.  Was it rock and roll?  Was it a rock and roll steak?  No.  Rock and roll was pretty good when we cooked up those steaks in the...  Yeah.  Guy Fieri likes to cook for us.  You didn't like it?  No, you didn't eat it.  You don't like steak.  Guy Fieri. 
[02:12:00]  But Guy Fieri is...  We're having a little problem with Guy Fieri.  Well, he's mysterious.  Wow.  What's the problem?  He's in a fight with his hairdresser and we might have brought it up.  We brought it up and maybe...  Maybe we're not supposed to bring it up.  Why shouldn't we bring it up?  I don't know.  It's a news story.  Oh, he was in studio.  I wasn't here.  No.  He wants it to go away.  I think the other problem was that he was in the building.  And we said...  Well, not only did you say no to Guy Fieri, but you brought his assistant in as a guest.  That's right.  I remember that.  Just to prove a point.  I had a fight with my hairdresser the other day.  I was like, listen, miss, please don't cut my hair like that. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, miss.  Miss.  No, this is a guy.  No, no, no.  See, it was another guy.  Oh.  And they were bitch-slapping each other.  You haven't seen the clip?  Have you ever seen the clip?  Oh, okay.  You've seen it.  And it was like...  It wasn't like at something that was being videoed or a professional thing.  It was just kind of on a personal...  It seemed very personal.  They were flying together.  Yes, they were.  They seemed a little drunk.  Oh, it was on TMZ.  Is this it?  You fucking dickhead. 
[02:13:00]  You fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  You're a fucking dickhead.  Oh, boy.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fuck.  Fuck you.  Oh, boy.  And he slams the door.  That's the kind of tiff you don't have with one of your buddies.  Yeah, I mean, even if people...  I've never fought like that with Kenny over anything.  Have you ever?  Even if my hairdresser shaved my head when I fucking fell asleep in a chair, I wouldn't...  I wouldn't have an outburst like that. 
[02:13:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, we love Guy Fieri.  Of course.  What do we got there, Roland?  Well, it's all part of the diet.  Yeah, that's just Roland's.  Sausage.  Sausage?  Sausages?  You put it in your sausage?  No, no, no.  Sugar?  Wine?  You have Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  Brisket from Snow's.  Something you might have to cook for Roland.  That's from Dex? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, Rolly.  I have no idea what you said.  I love your diet.  I heard sausage.  Sausage, brisket, ribs.  Yeah.  And Philly cheesesteak.  So what can you eat here?  You can eat...  I can eat the brisket.  You can eat everything but the tinfoil.  It's a good diet.  Yeah.  It smells damn good.  It does.  Where's this food from?  You have a friend, the website in front of you.  Sal printed it out.  Listeners love this part. 
[02:14:30]  I have what?  Sal gave you the one sheet, didn't you?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, Sal.  We can't do this segment without the plug.  Yeah, we're all about Plugola.  Yeah, we're Salador.  No, that's not it.  How did we get our little envelope at the end of the day without the official plug?  Oh, did Sal fuck this up?  Don't worry about it.  Just don't plug and enjoy the food.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, they'll be happy with that.  We could just do that.  What difference does it make?  It smells damn good.  Why are we doing this?  Because you wanted a Super Bowl food.  Oh, all right.  This is like our little Super Bowl thing. 
[02:15:00]  They're having a big Super Bowl blast down on Broadway.  We got...  Oh, Super Bowl Boulevard or whatever they're calling it.  Oh, right.  What a bomb that is.  There's five people down there freezing the balls off.  I came through the Lincoln Tunnel.  It was wide open.  I didn't see a car anywhere.  I didn't see people.  No one cares about this thing.  No one's going down to the Times Square.  No one's flying in from Florida to fucking ticket the bargain ride to go to New York City  with fucking fake snow.  They'll go to the Poconos, which is an hour and a half away in real snow. 
[02:15:30]  But you don't think they want to go to the fucking Fox Way?  Nobody cares about the fucking shit they built there.  Oh, look.  It's the biggest structure.  Nobody gives a shit.  On Fox Way, right off of Super Bowl Boulevard.  They'll practice a field goal.  Yeah.  How about that?  You could try to kick a field goal.  You can try that, Jim.  That's great.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Shut down traffic for that.  Just go to the local high school field and practice there.  You could practice a field goal any time you want. 
[02:16:00]  You could any time.  Any time you want.  It's just a bomb.  I love it.  And meanwhile, the Super Bowl's nine miles away in Jersey in the middle of the fucking swamps.  Right.  They're making it sound like it's just a daze in across the street.  Yeah.  What a strange choice because the stadium really is just in the middle of fucking nowhere.  It's nowhere in Jersey.  No.  It just makes it more of a pain in the ass, the whole thing.  And the teams, one of them's training in Florham Park, which is way out in Jersey where the Jets play. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  And I don't know where the other teams train.  I guess where the Giants train.  So they're not even in any part of New York at all.  No, no.  There's nothing to do with New York.  Right.  This guy wants to comment on Roland's diet.  He's from L.A., it looks like.  Andrew.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hold on a second.  Roro needs his headphones.  Wow.  Ice cream sandwiches.  Jimmy, hang in there.  Hang in there.  Go ahead, Andrew.  I just wanted to...  Roland was talking earlier about eating Chipotle.  What's that?  On his diet and all that stuff. 
[02:17:00]  I just want to give a quick comparison.  I'm assuming you've got chicken, since it's the highest in protein.  The calories in the Chipotle chicken is 180 and the sodium is 310.  Compare that to a Cool Ranch Doritos Loco Taco, and you have 160 calories and 70 milligrams  of sodium.  Ooh, thank you, 2020.  I think that diet is fucking...  So you shouldn't have had the Chipotle yesterday.  You want to say something to Andrew?  My bad, jackass. 
[02:17:30]  Fuck you, bad boy.  We're running the streets like you get hit by a truck, you asshole.  So you'll miss the Super Bowl.  What?  He's just giving me, like, some pointers.  I'm giving them pointers, too.  No one likes them.  Thank you for the call.  Even if Jesus hates you.  Thank you for the call, sir.  We'll get out your Super Bowl credit card holders as soon as we can.  Look, I've been dying for 25 years, all right?  25, 25 years.  You can sit there.  You can tell me how to die.  It's not going to work.  So you called up.  You were on hold this long, okay? 
[02:18:00]  For what?  All right.  So you can tell me I'm not going to eat Chipotle?  I'm not going to...  I'm going to eat Chipotle, all right?  If I'm going to want Chipotle, that's what I'm going to eat.  I'm going to eat Chipotle because I want to eat Chipotle.  Okay.  Credit card holder.  Roland said even Jesus hates that guy.  Yeah.  You're a bold statement.  You're rough.  Well, he was rough, too, so...  He wasn't rough at all.  He was giving you pointers.  I was giving you pointers, too.  When do we dole this shit out?  Yeah, what are you waiting for?  And where are the plates?  But when do you plan on breaking this diet that you're stopping it?  Not for a while. 
[02:18:30]  What does that mean?  Why stop a diet that you could just eat?  Eat everything.  It's amazing.  It's awesome.  This is from the people at what?  Foodie Direct?  What's Foodie Direct?  It's an awesome website.  So basically, if you like the ribs in Austin, you can go to the website, click on it, and  you get it from that particular restaurant in Austin.  That will hold this a different restaurant.  So it's kind of like Grubhub, but they ship fucking from state to state.  Grubhub, you can just order from different restaurants.  This, you can go all over the fucking country.  Like, this is from famous, from Buffalo, from Duff's. 
[02:19:00]  What's from Duff's?  You got chicken wings from Duff's today?  That's right there, yeah, from Duff's.  So you get shit from all over the country.  All over the country.  That's kind of weird.  That's pretty cool.  And this is from Snow's Barbecue in Austin, so it's like all the famous foods from that  place.  How good is that, Jimmy?  Duff's chicken wings are pretty damn good.  Couldn't they use the space on the planes that they're flying this for maybe a sick child  to be flown to a hospital?  Yeah, but they don't eat.  We eat foodies, not the children.  Our society's horrible. 
[02:19:30]  Where do they put the food?  I don't know, it's probably in first class, you know, just strapped in.  Put it under the seat.  Yeah, yeah, make sure it's all nice.  Those kids, the clock is ticking, but this is from my food for the Super Bowl.  The clock is ticking.  Jesus, Ro.  Well, this is delicious food.  I hear you, it's delicious food for the Super Bowl.  This is from the Phillies, I forgot this place, it's from the famous Philly.  Yeah, Philly, yeah.  Is it the one with the Swiss cheese with the guy that put his dick in the Swiss cheese?  Or is it the jerk-off guy that fucking was jacking off in Philly? 
[02:20:00]  A couple of cheese steakers.  Philly's got some perverts, man.  Yeah, they do.  Philly's like a perverted fucking place.  There's some shit going down.  In New York, we got our guys that usually pull their dick out on the subway, hey, look  at this.  But Philly's got like their angrily jacking their dick standing on a street corner, or  the Swiss cheese dick guy driving around showing girls his dick with Swiss cheese on  it.  His dick must smell.  Like just crazy perverse people in Philly.  If you're going to be a pervert, you've got to go all in.  Yeah? 
[02:20:30]  What's going to want?  Show him the video of the guy jerking off.  I can't.  Roland's food is all over.  Oh, Roland.  I don't want that.  That's a cheese steak, right?  Thank you.  Cheese steak's evil.  Not my diet.  I can't have bread.  What else do we have?  I can't have bread.  Wings.  Brisket ribs.  Hey, Henry, have a wing.  You look more like a heart and lungs guy.  Yeah, sausage.  Let's look at the brisket.  All the bite of sausage.  When was this stuff made if it's getting shipped from like Texas and all that stuff?  They warmed it up today.  The guy that...  Warmed it up today. 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  They said it was warm up.  Obama would say in a State of the Union address.  I'm not a fan of things being warmed up.  You've got to microwave in the kitchen.  Warmed up.  Not at all.  It's the girl's vagina.  Yeah.  Nothing.  We went to say in an airplane.  It came from some Asian guy on a bicycle pedaling from Texas with some ribs.  I don't know if you're supposed to warm up chicken wings.  Oh, you are.  You sure?  I'm sure they expedite this to keep the freshness and good taste, of course.  Let's watch this video as Roland dishes out the food. 
[02:21:30]  So the story goes this guy crashed into a chicken joint.  What was the chicken joint again?  I guess it doesn't really matter.  Motherfucker Popeye?  No.  Crown fried.  Crown fried.  Crown fried chicken.  Yeah.  On 5th and what?  I don't know.  Someplace else in Philly.  I'm just trying to go local for the kids.  What is there?  A drug deal going on behind them?  They don't even care?  Yeah.  It was 5th and something.  Lehigh.  In Lehigh.  5th and Lehigh down there in Philly. 
[02:22:00]  This guy crashes into a crown fried chicken and proceeds to jump out.  Was he naked already?  No.  He started taking his clothes off after the car accident.  Oh, I thought he was crazy.  And then he just starts jacking it.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Put it away.  Oh, snap.  And now he's jacking it.  And then he bends down.  He looks like he sticks a finger in his own ass.  I don't know what the fuck this guy's doing.  And then this asshole that filmed this just stopped filming. 
[02:22:30]  Why would he do that?  I would never stop filming.  Why?  Yeah, because you see this every day or something?  Why wouldn't you keep filming that?  Yeah.  That should be an hour video.  Right.  Why do people stop filming these things?  I don't know.  He was so turned on.  He had to go jerk off himself.  But the passion door is open.  And then all you see is he's nude.  But you see his back in his ass.  They arrest him?  And he's jacking it.  He doesn't have a bad ass.  He got away.  I don't know if they gave him.  They only gave him like a DUI.  They didn't give him other shit. 
[02:23:00]  He looks like Bob Kelly from the back.  Hey, could I have a plate over there, Roland, please?  Maybe they didn't see this video.  Troy, how's the food?  He can't tell you.  Why?  Because they won't allow it.  What?  Why not?  Why not?  Troy's right here.  Thank you, sir.  Troy Kwan's right here.  He's not allowed to talk.  But he's right there.  No, I know.  But he's just not allowed to say a word.  What if he sneezed?  Then he'd be fired.  Oh, God.  Then you'd get it in your pubes.  Oh, this is quality radio.  The rest gets from Snows in Texas. 
[02:23:30]  And then the other one's from Blacks in Texas.  What is what?  I'll let the other one.  From Snows.  What is?  The brisket, I'm eating.  Ridiculous.  What do you put on this shit?  Wow, this is good, man.  Nothing.  Just the...  Souse.  How about some fucking mustard, for Christ's sake?  You need to bring the mustard?  For what?  This place just doesn't cut the mustard.  Oh, you.  Save that shit for the after show. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, we're busy here.  I'm a sauce guy.  I need some sauce on it.  This brisket is good.  Oh.  Amazing.  Oh.  Souse.  A little sauce, yo.  What is that?  It's a sauce.  Yeah.  Don't you want a little sauce on yours?  I have a little sauce.  Yeah.  You got to get that sauce on there.  Let me have some, too.  Oh, you take some, I'll take some.  Just so the listeners, we can really make this a good break.  Yeah, yeah.  Listeners want to know we're putting some sauce on it.  My nigga, my nigga. 
[02:24:30]  My motherfucking nigga.  Wow.  Sirius doesn't play that version.  It was on in the bathroom today.  Well, maybe on the public place.  Well, they don't play in the bathroom.  Yeah.  They should play in the bathroom.  What's wrong?  What channel was it that was playing?  My Hitter, right?  Yeah, I don't know what channel was playing.  My Hitter, My Hitter.  Did Arsenio have him on and he was playing My Hitter?  I hope so.  Last night or something?  Really?  Yeah, I think so.  It doesn't work, My Hitter. 
[02:25:00]  So what do you guys think of the guy masturbating?  Seems right he had sex.  What about us?  YG featuring Jeezy and Rich Honeycomb.  This is it.  This was last night on Arsenio.  You know he ain't going to stay, nigga.  No way, yo. 
[02:25:30]  Live rap really sucks a kick.  It can.  It certainly can.  It's so rarely done well where it sounds like the record.  There's a handful of guys who can do it live.  The rest of them are terrible live.  Just suck.  Who could do it well?  JZ does it well live.  Oh, no.  It's because they're throwing so many words in there. 
[02:26:00]  You can't possibly keep your breath and yell like that.  In the studio, it's easy.  You just stop.  Right, you do seven takes.  Yeah, another take.  That's why a lot of these motherfuckers like two guys on stage.  And they can go back and forth.  Yeah, the hype man sings that song.  Yeah.  But, like, this sounds like dog shit.  Terrible.  I'm adding popcorn to my side dish.  At least you're letting the audience know.  Roland, what do you think of the popcorn?  They want to know. 
[02:26:30]  It's bad for you, the popcorn?  Yeah.  Roland, what if Bruce Springsteen wanted to go to dinner with you, but you had to eat bread.  You went to an Italian restaurant.  He's like, come on.  I would suck his cock if he asked me to.  You would suck his cock if he asked you to.  I would eat whatever he asked me to.  You would go off your diet and suck his dick.  How fucking desperate would Bruce have to be that he's asking Roland, hey, would you suck  my cock, Roland?  How desperate would he have to be to say, would you go to dinner for a friend? 
[02:27:00]  Do it for Jersey.  Yeah, huh?  Mmm.  One taste of the one.  Mmm.  I know what you just said.  Are the listeners happy for us?  They love this.  All right, Steve in Jersey.  Yes.  What's up?  What's up, Steve?  Not too much.  I just want to ask him why he hates fantasy football.  Oh, boy.  I don't know why he does.  It's ridiculous.  It's gay. 
[02:27:30]  You're gay.  You're gay.  Why is it gay?  Well, it's just, it's for nerds.  You don't think it's for good football fans?  No.  Are you a real football fan?  Do you have a favorite team?  But my in-laws and my father-in-law and all my pals in Philly, they all are into fantasy  football.  And they all are big fans of Dan Marino.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, of course.  That's cool.  But you're not a real football fan if you play fantasy football.  That's not true.  Who's your team?  Have you ever played it? 
[02:28:00]  I'm a Seahawks fan.  Have you ever played it?  Okay, you're a Seahawks fan.  What happens if you had Kaepernick on your team one week?  You needed him.  I don't know.  It was an injury or something like that.  You're going to root for a fucking arch rival in your division to do well because he's  on your team.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  That happens all the time.  That happens all the time.  That happens all the time.  You've got to take the 49ers defense, but you need them to lose the game.  So you're going to root for a 49er defense just to win your stupid game?  Comment, sir?  Have you ever played?  You're not answering the question. 
[02:28:30]  No, the real team supersedes the game.  It depends how much money you're playing for.  If you're playing for big money, fuck, you're a super seed.  You're rooting for the 49ers defense.  Then he's not a fan.  You're not a Seahawks fan then?  Nope.  I got $500 already on the Broncos this week to win the Super Bowl.  They're favored by two points, and I want the Seahawks to win 38-0.  I don't even care about the $500.  Yeah.  Have you ever played it?  No. 
[02:29:00]  Why would I?  How do you know it's a nerd?  Because I look at the people that play it.  And I think he understands.  He understands.  That's why when there's six guys in a sports bar with their laptops going,  who just caught that pass?  I got him on my team.  Do you know what number that was?  I got fucking six gadgets, and I'm looking up stats.  Nerds.  That's nerds.  That's nerds.  I want to sit next to the guy that's got 17 beers on the fucking table,  eating chicken wings, and yelling racial slurs at the TV. 
[02:29:30]  You are sitting next to him.  That's the guy I want to watch the game with.  There you go.  Are you still there, Steve?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Can you do a favor and just play for some big money and try it?  Oh, no.  No.  But that's not a good defense,  because I'm sure Florentine understands how fantasy football works. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I know there's money involved.  He understands what is involved.  He just doesn't want to do it.  Which is fine, but then I don't know why he hates it.  I can understand not doing it, but to, like, actually hate it, to me, it's...  Well, yeah, because you guys got, like, a whole 20 guys playing in your league,  and you got a commissioner.  It's a commissioner.  Yeah, and he has to approve the trades during the week.  Like, if some guy goes down, they have to go to commissioner.  Is it okay if he goes to...  No.  Ooh.  The commissioner.  Yeah, they go, who's the commissioner of the fantasy football league? 
[02:30:30]  Who is that fucking guy?  They all get excited for a draft.  We're going to have the fantasy football draft.  Oh, right, the big draft.  Yeah, everybody gets ready for a draft.  Oh, dude, do you love the draft?  The draft is the best part.  Oh!  Unless you got strippers there, and you're doing the back of a fucking scores.  With chicks on your cock, and you go, put that guy on my team.  I don't care.  I'm getting blown.  They wear the jerseys to the draft, like whatever their favorite team is. 
[02:31:00]  It's a big event, right?  Like a party.  Yeah, and they bring their computers.  Yeah, all right, who do you got?  And they got a board, yeah.  Yeah, look who I fucking joined.  Like, all excited.  Yeah, and the commissioner has to oversee the draft.  Ask him about...  Tell me, you think that's...  Anthony, is that fun?  That's gay.  Oh, there you go.  Ask him about the trophy, though.  Oh, yeah, and you got the trophy.  It's a fist that will latch onto your chair.  The trophy's like a guy sitting in an easy chair with the remote, you know, because you  want your football, you want it to be an easy chair. 
[02:31:30]  Right, right.  And then they have one that comes in last, like it's like a toilet.  Oh, shit, that's funny.  And whoever comes in last, and then, you know, you came in last, you got that trophy for  the whole year.  Hey, come on.  Look, you gotta fucking hang on to that trophy.  All right, let me ask you this.  Do you like to gamble?  Yes, yes, yes.  I love playing blackjack and poker, yeah.  It's the same thing.  No, it's not the same thing.  No, it's not even close.  There's nothing nerdy about being at a crap table in Atlantic City with cocktails in front 
[02:32:00]  of you.  Yeah.  Fucking with a bunch of degenerate gamblers around you.  That's like saying fucking, you know, like...  If you play for serious money, you would understand.  No, no.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't play for serious money.  I put $30,000 on one hand of blackjack, sir.  I think I know what playing for a lot of money is all about.  It means fantasy football.  Fuck that.  He said it's the same thing.  Dude, you have no idea the level of trying to block out his childhood that you're dealing  with here. 
[02:32:30]  All right, fellas.  It's like Dungeons and Dragons is the same as Call of Duty because they're both games.  Shut it.  Yeah.  You nerd.  Wow.  You hot.  Oh.  No, what's the matter?  We made fun of your little game.  He hung up, too.  Ah, you fucking pussy.  Imagine if you go over to someone's house and you see a trophy on the shelf.  You're like, what, your son?  Play Little League?  No, my fantasy football.  I won last year.  Fantasy football, man.  Fantasy football.  Imagine if you saw that.  Why are people so mad that that's your take on fantasy football? 
[02:33:00]  Plus the fact that you're a comedian.  Because they play.  You're pumping it up a little bit.  You have to blow up your spot.  You gay.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  My nephews play and it's like, you know what?  They connect with kids, you know, other kids in high school and whatever in eighth grade.  And that's cool.  You know, they freaking email each other.  That's a way to bond.  I get it.  But, damn.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to...  It's just a lot of...  It's so stupid.  When you have a draft, I'm going to draft this player.  Who are you going to get?  Oh, yeah.  I got him on my team.  Two, yeah.  Let's say hi to Rick in Charlotte. 
[02:33:30]  Jim, saw you here in Charlotte.  Love to completely agree about fantasy football.  The worst is going to a bar with some idiot and having him try to watch five games at one time.  100% agree.  I do feel like I'm the only one that doesn't play sometimes.  But I do have to call you out.  On this very show a couple of years ago, you said Peyton Manning would never be able to throw the ball five yards again because of his neck.  Do you remember that whole rant you went on?  No, I said that it could be a problem if he doesn't, if he doesn't come back from this injury. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, when he was auditioning for those teams, I think he went to audition for the Panthers.  He went down to Charlotte and he was having problems, but the Denver took a chance on him.  But he did get this surgery, this blood spinning thing in his neck, and it completely cured him.  At that point, he couldn't throw bombs.  And you even saw in the beginning when he came back with the Broncos his first year, his passes were still floating up there.  But he's actually recovered well from it.  I didn't know how it was going to be, but Denver definitely took a chance on him having a Chad Pennington arm. 
[02:34:30]  Elway looks like a genius now.  Yeah, I agree.  My recollection of that was not you saying, oh, yeah, if he may come around, it was more a 20-minute rant of he can't throw the ball five yards and never will again.  I could be wrong.  It was something similar to that, but at that point, he wasn't all the way back, but he still wanted to play, and Denver took a chance on him.  Dr. Florentine aired in his diagnoses. 
[02:35:00]  Sorry, I know.  Yeah, look, I've had shit growing on my dick before.  I'm like, ah, it's nothing, and it turned out to be a lot of things.  It was a man's asshole.  Exactly.  So, I'm not a doctor.  All right.  All good.  Thanks, Eric.  Thanks.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, I am so agreeing with Florentine on this fantasy shit.  I've got a nephew who plays fantasy football, baseball, basketball, and hockey. 
[02:35:30]  He can't go anywhere without his tablet or his smartphone.  He's constantly checking his fantasy shit.  And then about three weeks ago, my wife and I were with some other friends at the sports bar, and there was one table off the side.  There was eight guys sitting at this table, and all they were doing was checking fantasy stuff.  Laptops, tablets, smartphones.  Just doesn't sound like any fun at all.  All this bullshit.  They're just constantly writing scores down, and the one guy's going, yeah, I got him. 
[02:36:00]  Wait a minute.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, I did.  Sounds great.  All I could think of was Florentine's rant about, I just wanted to fucking throw a pitcher of beer at him.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, you got hot chicks walking around in little fucking outfits in there in a sports bar, a bunch of games going on, and you're checking 17 different tablets.  Yeah, great.  You know, in the second quarter to see how many passes Wes Walker caught.  Who gives a shit?  At four o'clock when the game's over, then you check.  You don't like the fucking commissioner?  The commissioner.  The commissioner. 
[02:36:30]  The commissioner.  I'll be the commissioner this year.  All right.  Well, you've got to run that past the commissioner.  I remember they said they rib each other during the week.  Who's ever in first?  If you're in last, if you want, I'll get you next week.  Oh, that's good.  That's fun.  So they do it through email, the chain email.  They rib each other.  It's a chat board.  A little chat board.  Like maybe Adrian Peterson on the Vikings didn't have a good week, and someone talked him and thought they was going to come in first.  Yeah, yeah.  So he gets ribbed.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  There's 15 nerds on a chain email going, oh, how did AP do this week? 
[02:37:00]  That sounds dangerous.  Yeah, that's fucking nuts.  It's like bullying.  You wouldn't want to be involved in that?  That sounds like one of the terrorist things.  I'd rather be involved in a child porn sting.  You will be.  That's why I don't bring my computer to fucking Best Buy.  Let's see how that's Doug in Hoboken.  Doug.  That would be a fun ribbing.  Hey, they got you with them Ian Watkins videos on you.  Wait till next week. 
[02:37:30]  Wait till I'm out in 40 years.  Doug, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, Florentine.  On one of your podcasts, you said one of the funniest fucking things I ever heard about.  Renting tuxedos.  And finding a fucking role in your tuxedo pocket from a wedding two years earlier.  And you fucking ate it.  I fucking laughed my ass off at that.  That was fantastic.  Thank you for doing that.  Wait, what happened?  Oh, no.  One of my podcasts, I did it at weddings and stopped making people rent tuxes and whatever.  There was a story where I had a suit and I only had one suit.  And I found a role in it like six months later from the last wedding I was at. 
[02:38:00]  And I went up eating it.  Because you always throw me because I know I was going to drive drunk that night.  So you've got to sober up with the bread.  So you fill the pockets up.  You ever do that, Anthony?  No, I've never done that.  You never got that slice of pizza before you left New York to get that little booze.  Well, yeah, I've eaten stuff.  Soak the booze in a little before you get behind the wheel.  I've never shoved rolls in my pockets.  No, I don't think I've done that.  But, yeah, oh, yeah, you've got to eat.  So you only wear suits when it's a wedding, like myself.  So you never get a dry clean. 
[02:38:30]  Do you get a dry clean every two years or something?  Maybe.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You find all sorts of shit in there.  I went in and I go, I want a suit where I can wear this in January in the winter and in fucking August.  Exactly.  When it's 90 out.  I don't want to fucking sum.  I don't care.  It's a summer suit.  Nobody's looking at me.  I'm going to the wedding.  Other people are getting married.  Nobody's looking at what I'm wearing.  I don't give a shit.  I've got another football question for you.  Peyton Manning wins the Super Bowl.  Does he retire? 
[02:39:00]  No.  No?  No.  He's got a great team there.  He could come back and win another one.  What about far coming?  He had one of the best years he's ever had in his career.  How old is he?  38-ish?  37, I think he is.  37?  You think Far will come back?  Far doesn't even know where he is.  That poor bastard.  You don't like him?  With his concussions.  He's good that he's out of the picture now and there's not so much drama.  Yeah.  Who was the one we saw recently?  Tony Dorsett has the head injury?  Tony Dorsett's a mess, man.  Holy fuck.  Fuck. 
[02:39:30]  That was a shit.  What are they going to do?  These rage issues?  These fucking head issues.  Well, I think the courts just overturned their...  No, I know.  They're going to pay those guys out $765 million, which came out to like $70,000 a guy or something.  It was a joke for those guys.  But they just overturned that, so the NFL is going to, you know...  They're not going to do anything.  Well, they're hoping not to.  It's pretty much, hey, this is what you want to do.  It's part of the price you pay.  They should take care of them, though.  They make so much fucking money.  It's $10 billion a year the NFL brings in.  $10 billion? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, that's not that much.  Oh, that's a lot.  Oh.  Is that more than any other sport?  Football?  I think so.  Has to be, right?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe baseball, but that's over.  So many games.  Yeah.  Two games, though.  Yeah, true.  But take care of those old guys, man.  Poor old bastards.  You know what's going on there.  Don't fucking say, we need to look at more studies about concussions.  You don't have to look at them.  All you have to do is go to one football game and sit close to the field and realize how  fucking violent football is to watch on that level.  They just throw their bodies at each other at full speed. 
[02:40:30]  And you hear the helmets hitting, and you're like, holy fuck, how are they handling that?  They're wearing helmets.  It's safe.  They don't want to agree to it because there's still, you know, kids aren't going to play  football anymore, and that's going to be a problem.  There are going to be some, but you're going to get probably like 40 to 50% less kids.  You need those guys coming up.  As soon as parents realize and catch on that, you know, these head injuries are causing depression  and all this other shit, they're not going to let their kids play football.  Well, Obama's imaginary son, he said he wouldn't let him play football either.  Oh, right. 
[02:41:00]  That imaginary son that he had that would look like Trayvon.  Trayvon, yeah, that's right.  That doesn't play football.  Well, he looks like a lot of different people at this point.  A lot of different people.  He didn't look like that white kid that got shot in that neighborhood in local Oklahoma City.  Not at all.  No, no.  No, he didn't look like him.  He doesn't look like any of the black guys that do the knockout game.  Doesn't look like them.  Doesn't look like him either.  No, no, no.  We've got another great question for you, Florentine.  We get the special questions when you're out.  Oh, I love the question.  Charlie in Santa Cruz.  Charlie.  Charlie.  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[02:41:30]  Hey.  Florentine, what do you think about guys who drive around with the special little flags  that they put in their windshield and they wear in the guy's jersey?  I thought girls used to wear that for their boyfriend.  You know when a car's driving around and they got, like, the Broncos flag?  Thank God I haven't seen that because I'd fucking...  You've never seen that?  Well, I might have, but I don't see that really yet.  Yeah.  I would run them off the road.  Take it.  If you've seen it in a parking lot parked in a Home Depot, just go fucking break it.  I'm not...  I don't mind a team jersey people wearing, but it seems weird wearing another guy's name 
[02:42:00]  on your back, like you're going steady with the fucking guy, like wearing a Jeter jersey  or something.  It's like...  Well, although his name isn't...  It's on the back of the ones that they buy at the stadium.  Right.  The actual players don't even have their names on the back.  But it just seems odd to have another man's name on your back.  Everyone does it.  It's my boy.  They don't do it, though, man.  I know.  I just find it a little...  I'm not in a jersey thing.  I get it if you want to wear it out, your team's playing, but when the guys put their 
[02:42:30]  own name on the back of the jersey, that's really ridiculous.  That's cool.  Look, it's my team.  I'm part of the team.  Yeah, you don't have a cowboy jersey that says Norton on the back?  No.  Although, you'd probably be better.  Yeah, I'd throw less interceptions than the one with Romo written on it.  This guy...  Hey, man, Jimmy, why don't you shut the fuck up?  Yeah, his defense isn't good.  Shut up.  He's a cunt.  This guy wants on bad.  We're back to fantasy football. 
[02:43:00]  Go ahead, guy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  It says you want to be on bad.  I know, man.  I called, like, fucking six different occasions.  I'm on hold for, like, an hour.  Well, here's your shot.  Well, we're a very popular radio show, sir.  Hit a home run.  Here you go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  You got Florentine.  He's listening.  But I just wanted to say that you're totally off base about fantasy football.  I think he is, too.  Okay, thanks.  You're gambling the whole time.  You have a chance to win money.  And it's something fun you can do while you're watching it with your friends. 
[02:43:30]  Without checking it out.  I'm just watching the game.  It's fun with your friends.  One game.  How is it fun with your friends?  It's fun with your friends, Jim.  How is it fun?  And Florentine, first of all, I think he sounds like a fucking 55-year-old woman with emphysema.  So his opinion doesn't mean anything.  He got you there, though, Jim.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  If I sound like a 55-year-old woman, I can't have an opinion.  Well, these guys are fucking nerds checking their tablets.  Fuck fantasy football.  That's actually a pretty good impression.  That ain't bad. 
[02:44:00]  Not bad.  Not bad.  You turned him around a little bit.  He still doesn't agree with you, though.  Oh, Jim's now doing an impression of you.  He's sucking a dick.  See what we did there?  See, but the only angle I have is, like, you win it, you're gambling.  Yeah, that's the one.  You put, what, $200 in the pot, and then you win fucking $1,200 at the end of the year?  Just bet on the fucking game.  Yeah.  On one game.  It's not about the money on a game-to-game basis.  It lasts the whole time.  And you get to bond with your old friends that you haven't been in contact with. 
[02:44:30]  Why can't you just call them and go, hey, what's going on?  How's the wife and kids?  Want to go get a beer?  We'll watch the game at a bar or something.  And it's not just about the money.  There's also, it's about honor.  There's a little bit of honor.  Oh, he didn't just say that.  You're not wrong, dude.  Oh, he didn't.  Shut up, Jimmy.  But he's not.  Florentine has just got the deuce chills.  Now, I've got honor.  Florentine, you want to comment on that?  Wait, wait, why do you honor?  I need him to, yeah.  Yeah, guy, why honor? 
[02:45:00]  Why honor?  Because there's pride.  There's some pride in outwitting everybody, picking the right guys.  You did your thing.  You won.  That's true.  You know where else there's pride?  At the fish place, Captain Hook's fish place.  That's right.  You've got to have pride.  Wear the uniform down to deliver those boxes for Catch of the Day boxes down to those guys  at IBM.  That's right.  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  Some pride and honor.  Honor and pride.  Anthony, when you're at the craps table. 
[02:45:30]  Right, right, right.  Do you have honor and pride that you outwitted the fucking dealer and all that shit when you're  playing blackjack?  When I say, hit me, and my 16 turns into a 21?  Yeah.  It's all about honor and pride.  How I got that dealer.  I think that's just, you're just the fucking degenerate camel.  You Dungeons and Dragons fag.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's exactly what it is.  Dungeons and Dragons for football.  Look who I got.  I got the mystical sword of Denver. 
[02:46:00]  Shut it.  No Dungeons and Dragons.  Try to make it sound cool.  It's gambling.  Yeah, right.  Hey, sucking dick is sex.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Shut it.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  All right, we love you too.  You don't like the fact that he tried to equate it to gambling?  They all do that.  It's all that you can gamble, but it's not the money, it's the honor.  All right, Semper Fi, Marine.  I don't know why everyone's getting all bent out of shape because Florentine goofs on fantasy 
[02:46:30]  football.  Most of our audience probably plays fantasy football.  Who gives a fuck?  If someone calls in and goes, dude, really, you still listen to Judas Priest?  I'm like, yeah, I do.  That's ridiculous.  They haven't had a hit since 1980.  All right, but I like them.  I get it.  Yeah.  If you're a man, I get it.  I like it.  Let's go to Rochester.  Jason.  I'm not in a fucking fantasy football heavy metal league.  I'm not going to take Hetfield this week because I'm taking Brian Johnson from ACDC.  Yeah?  Over who, though? 
[02:47:00]  Over who?  You're crazy.  Well, look, I have a lot of pride.  I have a lot of pride, man.  If Hetfield could fucking sing during the Grammars, it's a lot of honor.  Oh, fuck, man.  I fucking had Dimebag.  Right.  Shit, man.  Let's go to...  He's on the TL.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason in Rochester.  Jason.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Jason.  I love Florentine's podcast to begin.  I completely agree with him about the NFL being fixed towards storylines.  Yeah, but...  I'm a Vikings fan, and back in 2009, when the Saints beat them, they were coming off the 
[02:47:30]  whole Katrina thing, and it was America's team.  Jimmy Johnson passed the name down to the Saints, it was America's team, and even Goodell, after  the game, even shook, really, it's a statement saying he met with the Vikings and shook his  hand, and shook their hand, and said that the calls were questionable, and they're going  to change the rules about overtime because of that game.  Then the Saints went on, and there was questionable calls in the Super Bowl against the Colts and  Manning, so I think Manning's going to get all the calls this weekend.  So you believe what Florentine's saying. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, he's like...  It's not blatantly obvious, but...  It's not blatantly obvious, but, you know, they know.  Right.  Well, the hits on Farver low the whole game, and they never got called one hit on Farver.  Farver?  Farver.  They were low, and...  Farver.  Farver, very, very, very...  And in overtime, we helped the 70 yards total, in the whole second half in overtime.  That was supposed to be the number one offense.  And in overtime, they called four straight plays in the Vikings defense to move them into...  ...field orange.  Right.  I like this.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  He's got a point there.  He's got his facts.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Walter in Jersey, who is a fantasy football player.  Oh.  Butt.  He's got a butt, though.  Go ahead, Walter.  Butt.  I have a player, but honor and pride, that just gave me deuce.  Thank God.  Exactly.  Yeah, you guys said it.  Your fellow fantasy football, you know, player really pumped it up a little too much.  When he died, it's like, oh, you didn't say that.  We lost everybody.  We all winced here.  Yeah, well, we were supposed to, but even the fantasy football players out there were wincing. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, the way that he probably plays is in the corner with his fucking glasses on,  praying down stats so he can brag about it on the fucking team.  There's no, because, look, if you have Wes Welker for your fantasy football team this week,  it's just pure luck if Peyton Manning decides to throw it to him 15 times during a game.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe the other guy was covered.  You didn't make that decision.  You don't know the fucking other defensive game plan.  You don't know any of that.  No.  It's just pure luck. 
[02:49:30]  You don't even have an interest in it.  Wes Welker might have broke a tackle after a one-yard pass and ran 99 yards.  And that has nothing to do with you.  It's like rolling that stupid die in Dungeons & Dragons and having the dungeon master.  He's like the commissioner.  You know, he oversees everything.  It's just another dumb fucking nerd game.  Look what we got.  We got an expert that's going to talk about fantasy football, right?  Oh, yeah.  Is it reasonable?  Mike Francesa.  Boys, I couldn't resist calling experts to the great Jim Florentine. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  Jim Florentine's in.  I've tried to call him multiple times, okay?  And these nerds that are calling up are just that, okay?  Now, listen.  This is your cup of tea, okay?  You like fantasy football.  You like fantasy football.  Okay?  The kids in the office play it all the time.  I don't even know the word to computer, okay?  But if you're into fantasy football, then you're not really watching the game, okay?  I don't walk around with jerseys, okay?  I don't sit around with fantasy players, okay?  This is so good.  I don't sit around with fantasy players.  Now, I heard it earlier.  I heard Anthony and Sam going back and forth with a little rapport with my impression, okay? 
[02:50:30]  And they're getting better, okay?  But my fear is they get too good and you don't need me anymore, okay?  I don't think that's going to happen.  No, no, Mikey.  We want you, sir.  What do you think about the big game?  Who's going to win the Super Bowl this year?  Well, isn't the CLC?  It's a very tough team, okay?  They're a very tough team.  But let's not forget, not a human player on the other side, okay?  He's an immortal player, okay?  I mean, this is one of these all-world players, okay?  And then, okay? 
[02:51:00]  Now, Eli has two Super Bowls, okay?  If Peyton wins two Super Bowls, he's undeniable, okay?  I mean, he's undeniable, okay?  No, I agree.  I don't like this team set in our life, okay?  I agree.  I tune in.  I don't like this part, okay?  I don't like my athletes.  I don't like my athletes doing comedy.  I don't like my comedians doing sports, okay?  That's the way it is.  That's the way it is.  I hear you.  What about the Papa John commercials?  Those are terrific.  Well, the only thing I'm into is the pizza, okay?  You can put Papa John's and Pomegranate. 
[02:51:30]  I'm into it, okay?  But if you have them up there selling electronics,  so you have them up there doing Santa Claus.  And what are you washing that Papa John's down with?  Diet Coke.  It's Diet Coke.  Everyone knows it's Diet Coke.  You've got to watch out when you uncap that, though.  That isn't shaken up.  Hey, Mike, have you figured out that that thing is not a credit card holder yet?  Oh, you're talking about Super Bowl, okay?  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  Okay, the Super Bowl.  Right, I don't care about Super Bowl.  So, listen, me personally, I don't carry credit cards, okay? 
[02:52:00]  I don't carry credit cards.  I don't need leg wongs, okay?  Now, I don't know if you guys have ever been to Super Bowl, okay?  But I have.  I've been to 30 of them, okay?  32.  So I think I know a little bit about Super Bowl, okay?  Now, I do want to mention that you brought up that package, okay?  Now, you're coming out with these 20th anniversary shirts, okay?  We're going A-shirts, okay?  Yeah.  I think it should be on the list.  And Roger Goddard is going to send me a fucking Super Bowl package, okay?  We're going to deserve an all-in shirt, okay?  Okay.  We'll make sure we get you one.  Now, Super Show 2 is coming up, okay?  And I think you need to change the cast, okay?  And Mike Princess is available, okay? 
[02:52:30]  So that makes sense to happen, too, okay?  Hold on.  We're going to show it first, okay?  And then we'll talk about Super Bowl Show 2.  I might be too busy.  But I just want to try to quickly before I hang up.  I'm very busy, busy week.  I don't know if you're familiar, but I am broadcasting every day from 1 o'clock from the M&M store down the block.  You might be able to come on by or send young Sam Roberts on it with a microphone and really go face-to-face with the God of Radio, okay?  Now, one last thing I'd say about Marshawn Lynch, okay?  The attitude that he took, I don't know if you're familiar. 
[02:53:00]  He's the Seattle, the Florentine is familiar, of course.  He's running back on the Seahawks, okay?  He's decided that he is going to the biggest media event on the planet, okay?  And doesn't want to talk to the press, okay?  Marshawn, I could put a baboon or orangutan in front of the camera.  He's going to give me more than he gave me, okay?  Now, somebody say six in one hand, half of those in the other, okay?  Baboon, Marshawn Lynch, it doesn't matter, okay?  But in my opinion, you go to Super Bowl, okay?  You've got to speak up except for Mike, okay?  Now, here's my prediction. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to hang up.  I want my shirt, okay?  28-21 final of the Denver Broncos.  Ah, the Denver Broncos.  Nice.  Thank you, Mikey.  Good day, sir.  Good day, boys.  All right, Mike Francesa.  Great impression.  That's not Mike.  Really good.  That's the best one out there.  He gets all those subtleties.  The one guy does the videos that do very well, but our Francesa is the best.  I love looking at Francesa.  He's so angry at everything.  Oh, it's great.  When they go, hey, Mike, how you doing?  Good, good.  He doesn't even want to answer that. 
[02:54:00]  He doesn't even want to say hi.  He's already even asked.  Yeah, so cranky.  No one cares, anyway.  I don't care, but let's say hi to Dan in Jersey.  Dan.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  So you're totally missing the whole point about fantasy football.  Still.  Still.  It's got gambling, sure.  It's got all that.  But the real reason why fantasy football is great is it gives you an excuse to sit on  the couch with your friends, watch football for eight hours on a Sunday, and not have  the wife bother you while you're drinking about it. 
[02:54:30]  He's trying to make it sound cool.  I got a wife.  I sit on the couch for eight hours, and I drink beer, and I don't watch fantasy football.  You could do that without watching it.  Do you have a man cave that you're watching?  No.  A man cave.  No.  I don't have that either.  No.  A man cave is called a wife.  I don't have to hang shit on the wall.  I'm a Dan Reno fan.  I don't have to hang a poster on the wall to remind me that I like them.  You're sequestered to the worst room in the house by your wife that you have to now call  a man cave to keep any masculinity or fucking anything of your manhood. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  That's what a man cave is.  Your wife let you fucking turn one room in the house you bought into a place downstairs.  Where you can hang out, and you make it seem like, yeah, this is where I go to.  Yeah.  And she's got the whole rest of the house to wander around.  To wander around.  She checks on there once in a while.  Fucking, yeah.  You boys doing okay down there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're just going over our fantasy football stats.  Yeah, yeah, our fantasy football stats. 
[02:55:30]  She shuts the door, rolls her eyes, and wishes she had a man.  They put, like, two easy chairs, like, side to side.  Right.  So then the buddy could play video games or do the fantasy football.  And they've got a little beer holder.  Sometimes they have a kegerator.  It's a little keg, like a little refrigerator.  So, because, you know, because guys like beer.  Yeah.  So they've got a kegerator.  So it's right there.  You could just sit in your easy chair.  They fist bump when something happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, you the man.  The whole house should be considered the man cave.  And she should have a room she goes into with her girlfriends called the hen cluckery. 
[02:56:00]  Cluckery.  And her and her dumb-knitting hen friends just sit there and cluck nonsense at each other.  Yeah, let them have to go to some dumb room.  But do you know what, you know that they put a sign on the door, what happens in the man cave stays in the man cave.  Oh.  Yes, they put that on.  And then there's rules, like, rules in a man cave.  Rules for the man cave.  Yeah, no women allowed.  Right.  No talking about romantic comedies.  No.  Oh, wow.  I would like that sign in the door, what happens stays. 
[02:56:30]  If you see, like, a spot, like where a rug used to be, and fucking, what is it, Illuminol lights it up?  Yeah.  Like, what happened here?  Was there a wife murdered on this rug?  A little bit of scalp has been found.  Oh, the rules.  I know.  What happens to the man?  It's not like Vegas in there.  There's no hookers.  There's no fucking gambling.  Nothing's happening in the man cave.  There's no clubs with hot chicks drunk.  Embarrassment is happening in the man cave.  Well, now we got a Dungeons and Dragons guy that's all pissed off. 
[02:57:00]  Really?  Is he going to try to defend that?  Jeff in California.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  I'm absolutely not going to try and defend Dungeons and Dragons.  We know it's a nerdy thing to do.  We sit around, get drunk, roll dice around.  But we definitely don't want to be lumped in with these Jag-offs.  Stop rolling, mate.  He's got a great line there.  Go ahead.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah, I'm absolutely not going to try and defend Dungeons and Dragons.  No, we heard all that.  Go ahead.  I heard you.  Yeah, we're just not going to be lumped in with these Jag-offs that play fantasy football. 
[02:57:30]  He doesn't.  The Dungeons and Dragons guy.  They don't want to be lumped in with the fantasy football guys.  Wow.  Ouch.  All right, sir.  That's bad when the Dungeons and Dragons people think you're fucking too nerdy.  Why don't we take a little break?  Our dad's never had a man cave.  Hell no.  A man cave?  They had the house.  They had the house.  They went in the garage.  They built shit.  They had a few beers.  And then they'd go in the living room and hang out and watch whatever the fuck they wanted.  And the wife had to deal with it.  Yeah, what if that goes, hey, the wife's like, yeah, but I want to watch Happy Days. 
[02:58:00]  Like, yeah, but the football game's on.  The game's on.  You know that.  You know, I like that.  Well, there's another TV in the bedroom.  Right.  Oh, okay.  You know what they had instead of man caves?  Watch it on the portable.  Instead of man caves, they had lung cancer.  From their fucking factory jobs.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That was, yeah, they were real men.  Now they've made an excuse.  They've rationalized being sequestered to a single shitty room with tacky decor because  their wives have now cast ownership on the house. 
[02:58:30]  Hold on one minute.  That's exactly what it is.  Have a man house, you fucking fruits.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Who was the guy that we had on that ended up getting a man house?  A whole man house.  Remember the Pacific Rim guy?  The guy that did Pacific Rim.  Yeah.  The guy that did Pacific Rim.  The Pacific Rim, yeah.  Yep.  Turns out, like, you know, his wife was kind of getting in his way of what he wanted, so  he said, fuck this, and he went down.  He bought a whole nother house.  He went down the road and bought a whole nother house that he could do whatever the fuck he  wants, and he visits the other house.  He wakes up in the morning, he leaves the fucking house, and goes to his fun house, where it's 
[02:59:00]  horror movie memorabilia, it's shit all over the place.  And then he's done there, he locks up, goes home.  And then he goes home to his wife and his family, you know.  Perfect.  When he has to, but a whole house.  But he's not dealing with a man cave.  Man cave.  He said, fuck that.  Sitting there in the recliner.  Most of us don't have the money to have a man house.  Or how about no recliners?  Because you're sitting in like, hey, I got these seats from Yankee Stadium.  Yeah, I bought them.  Yeah, and you sit in the actual seats. 
[02:59:30]  What about all the bobbleheads?  They got like a lot of bobbleheads on the shelves.  You need your bobbleheads.  Yeah.  They line them up, they got them all, you know.  I'm going to put this in my man cave.  You're going bobbleheads in your fucking man cave?  Bob in Illinois.  Yeah, you guys are missing the point about this thing.  He did it.  Yeah, we're missing the point again.  You might be right, what's the point?  What is it?  What is it?  It's a chance you can sit around your friends and wish you were blown up, but you're too  scared to do anything about it.  Phone crept out, dude. 
[03:00:00]  What did you say?  Oh, man.  No.  Yeah, right.  Your phone.  Hello?  Yeah.  We hear you.  I get it.  Dr. Steve wants in on this, too, for some reason.  Dr. Steve, you play fantasy football?  Yeah.  At the hospice.  Yeah, we do.  I'll give you two Ethels for a Brenda.  I'll give you a George for an Edna toe tag.  We lost a Mildred yesterday.  He's in one of those death leagues.  You all pick a few, do you? 
[03:00:30]  They die so fast.  They don't even pick the year they're going to die.  You have to pick the day and the time and what commercial has to be on TV.  Imagine what game they were playing on Price is Right.  Yeah.  I'll give you a Mildred with a Mountain Climber.  Okay.  What do you got on this fantasy football thing?  Well, I was going to say that Dungeons and Dragons guy was fucking lying because there  is a Dungeons and Dragons version of fantasy football.  No.  There is?  It's called Blood Bowl. 
[03:01:00]  And you play with these little miniatures and you can have your Orc team versus your  Wood Elf team.  Oh, yeah.  No fucking way.  Yep.  Yep.  So anyway, that's all I got.  Just Google it.  It's called Blood Bowl.  Google it.  Go Google it.  Oh, man.  That sounds terrible.  And you know, you're supposed to have a name for your fantasy football team.  Right, right, right.  Like this one guy who was named Tom, so his team was called the Tominators.  So, you know, when you're standing each week in the third email, the mass email, you know, 
[03:01:30]  Tominators in third.  Hey, Tominators is doing all right, man.  What are we going to do?  Tominators.  I have the Blood Bowl in my bed every once a month.  Wow.  I play the Blood Bowl with the young lady.  What's that Blood Bowl?  The Blood Bowl.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm not afraid of a little blood.  Of course not.  Those fucking pesky eggs won't be acting up again. 
[03:02:00]  We're going to take a little break.  So, Florentine, where are you going to be again there, sir?  This weekend, McGoobe's Joke House.  Nice.  Simone in Maryland, February 6th, next Thursday, Improv, West Palm Beach.  Then also the next night in Coral Gables, Florida, Open Stage Club.  And then Fort Pierce at the Sunrise Theater, Saturday, February 7th.  Jesus.  A busy guy rattles him right off the top of his head.  Fucking professional.  It is.  I've got a podcast, that metal show, this Saturday night at 11 o'clock. 
[03:02:30]  Jesus.  VH1 Classic.  Nice.  And also Foodie Direct, if you order it today, you'll get in time for the Super Bowl.  Foodie Direct?  Foodie Direct and foodiedirect.com.  The food is good.  At Foodie Direct on Twitter.  The food, it was really good, yeah.  They can pick from over 40 purveyors, so it's a big selection.  All right, very cool.  Yeah.  We're going to wrap up next, either.  Oh, shit, you had to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul tells us about teaching karate.  My friend was a karate teacher.  You'd get in there and everybody would take off our clothes. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, let me show you the crane.  Give Sensei Pro a kiss.  Get over here and drink Uncle Paul's snake girl.  Judo, judo, chop, chop, chop.  Chop your penis.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall. 
[03:03:30]  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back on SiriusXM.  Best news ever. 
[03:04:00]  We were just discussing podcasts.  Jim Florentine has one of the better ones out there.  Are you part of the Riotcast?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I'm part of the Riotcast, yeah.  Bobby Kelly and a bunch of guys.  Regular Riot.  Boss, Nick Apollo.  Nick, right.  Don't forget.  Sandy, Sam Miller.  Okay, yes.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  All right.  Yeah, they have some villains.  So go medicine.  Go, you know, subscribe to the Jim Florentine podcast.  Please do that.  Comedy metal midgets.  And we're in the podcast thing, too, you know.  I know. 
[03:04:30]  We're goofing around with the podcast thing.  This week, what, it's Bob Kelly?  Super Puke.  We're calling it Super Puke for Super Bowl, you know.  We have themes for our podcast.  That's all right.  I always have a theme.  I have a topic, and I just go around.  Clever.  Now, you've got to call it the Big Puke.  You can't use Super Puke.  Super Puke.  Oh, that's right.  Are you okay that we named our podcast Super Puke?  Absolutely.  Anything with puke is fucking fine with me.  What if our fantasy football team name had Puke in the title?  Would you be okay with that?  Yeah, it's way better than the Tominators or something. 
[03:05:00]  The Tominators.  The Tominators.  The Tominators.  Yeah.  The Tominators, man.  How about the cunt-sniffing shitbags?  Oh, that'd be great.  Hey, you know what?  You're not taking it seriously.  You don't know.  It'd be CSSP.  Pride and honor in this.  Pride and honor.  Pride and honor.  Pride and joy, Jerry.  Pride and joy.  Keep it.  You can use a...  Nothing better than puke pictures.  I must have, like, seriously, like 500 puke pictures of friends puking.  Really?  Yeah.  On your phone, yeah?  Not on my phone.  Just over the years, you know, at bars.  If they...  I've got to go puke. 
[03:05:30]  Hanging on his walls.  I'd be out there like the fucking paparazzi snapping away.  There is nothing better than one of your friends just puking his guts up.  There was one shot of me.  My friend got him.  Me puking.  The whole...  It almost looks fake.  Because it's a full...  Coming all the way out, like...  It's at least, like, a foot long.  Projectile, right.  A nice tube.  Yeah.  So when I got the pictures developed, I got, like, 15 extra copies.  And I would go to local supermarkets and put them on those chalkboards.  Where people are looking for babysitters.  And just stand there.  And wait for people to go, oh, my God. 
[03:06:00]  You're an animal.  Four teeth's an animal, man.  And we'd take pictures of our logs with corn in it.  And we'd put them on those chalkboards in the supermarkets and just stand there.  Like, I don't know.  Are you going to go there Saturday?  Like, we're talking and just watch people's reactions.  Right.  Right.  So...  Isn't that crazy?  I don't know if you did long pictures.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely long pictures.  What a lovely fucking animal.  Awesome. 
[03:06:30]  Good, clean fun.  So, super puke is the best of Bob Kelly puking on our show, basically.  Oh, yeah.  And you go to our...  The link is nice and easy on our Facebook page.  Everywhere, yeah.  O&A Show on Facebook and anywhere you get podcasts.  Just search Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Just give me an easy link that I can tweet for the people.  Because I'm so sick of people going, how do I get your podcast?  Go to the Facebook page and get it.  That's unbelievable.  And the other thing I want to say, I was discussing the whole fantasy football break with Florentine.  These people don't understand.  Like, relax.  It's okay. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We're just goofing on something you love.  It's okay.  We're all going to be all right.  When you start agreeing on everything, there's no comedy there.  Right.  Like, we're not stupid.  I would guarantee most of our audience plays fantasy football.  Take your beating.  It's going to be okay.  Plus, I asked Florentine, do you lose sleep over this?  Of course not.  He's a comic.  He's got a good bit going.  Yeah.  You don't give a fuck in the end.  But people are still calling and they're fucking pissed.  We get it.  They always go with the gambling.  It's gambling. 
[03:07:30]  It's always.  You put $200 in a pot and 17 weeks later, you might win $800.  That's not gambling.  That's 10 minutes of tipping at the table for me.  Even if you only make like $40 or $50 a year, put $200 in.  Now you're just bragging.  For four months.  Big spender out there.  Now you're just rubbing it in.  The football season's four months.  You're putting $200.  That's $50 a month you're gambling.  That's not gambling.  Ridiculous.  We have another masturbation story.  We barely touched on the one in Philly, whatever.  The video's out there. 
[03:08:00]  The guy, he's fucked up.  He crashes his car and then gets naked and starts masturbating.  But the asshole filming decides 13 seconds is good enough.  What an idiot.  He kind of blew it for all of us.  You were the guy there.  Do you think they caught it, maybe?  Whoever posted it?  Maybe it just got boring after that.  No, maybe they just caught it because it got too graphic.  Maybe the cops showed up and, you know, cops probably said enough already.  Who knows?  It's just the video should have been longer.  No, they were from inside a store or something.  They were far enough away.  Now we've got a Metro North worker pleasuring himself in front of a sleeping female rider 
[03:08:30]  and then leaves evidence on her body.  Where?  What did he leave?  Where did he arc one?  A Metro North worker was arrested Tuesday for pleasuring himself in front of a dozing rider  on a commuter train in Connecticut.  Manny, he cleans the cars, I guess.  A train car cleaner.  Sal.  Wow, and he messes it up.  He's trying to keep himself employed.  Yeah, there's some anger there, right?  That he's stuck cleaning the train, so he decides, fuck that. 
[03:09:00]  Look what I do now.  Charged with misdemeanor, counsel of public indecency and breach of peace.  Breach of peace?  Yeah.  That's a charge?  They're talking about his cock.  After being collared, not long after darting out of the Fairfield Station,  he got caught because the female victim, who was on the 735 at a Grand Central Station,  she opened her eyes and saw the dude exposing herself and performing the loot act.  So she's basically like, what the fuck you're doing?  Did she catch the money shot?  Did she suck it? 
[03:09:30]  She also found physical evidence from the act on her body.  That's so great.  Clear stuff.  Yeah, her knee.  That's cum.  They just can't have cum in the paper.  That's great.  Sam, collect the evidence with your mouth.  All right, this is a beautiful girl.  She was hassled on the way home, Sam.  Ah, gee, Quince, I don't know.  Detective Monaghan, there was cum in her eyebrows, nose, scalp, and vagina.  I know, I licked all of them.  That's just a creep right there. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  He could get a good lawyer, say, hey, she must have been dreaming.  She had a nightmare.  Oh, but what about the jizz evidence?  Yeah, there's jizz evidence.  How do you make that go away?  Well, in a court of law.  That jizz evidence.  Right.  So you think she opened her eyes and he was in the middle of cumming?  Maybe.  Maybe because he went, oh.  Or maybe he went, look, look, look, and she opened her eyes.  Yeah, opened her eyes and he sealed them right shut again. 
[03:10:30]  Ooh.  Roro.  That's why he's called Roro.  Why is that?  Brings in the movies for the kid.  You got one for Florentine?  He's got a kid.  I just got cloudy with a chance of meatballs, too.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He was just watching that the other day.  You got an extra coffee?  I don't.  Fuck.  And what?  Well, we got some of this stuff you could bring home if you like.  Thank you.  As Roro cleans up the mess in the studio from the food people.  Roro, did you have anything to eat? 
[03:11:00]  No.  None of this.  Mm-mm.  Why?  You said you can eat it all.  I know.  I'm just busting your guys' balls.  No, I'm on the diet.  Oh, Roro didn't have any.  Come on.  Because the brisk isn't on the diet?  I ate it because I thought it was on your diet, so I figured I'd be all right.  No, I had sugar on top.  Because there's sugar on there.  Why didn't you tell me that?  That's what made it so delicious?  For the show.  For the show.  That's how they make that shit good?  They put the sugar on the top?  They put brown sugar in the spice and that.  I swear to you, the only reason I ate it was because I thought it was on his fucking diet.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, but you're drinking those big Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks things with sugar in it.  No, no sugar.  What was that thing you were drinking?  Just an iced latte.  There's no sugar in it.  Roro's all in it.  There's sugar in the milk.  You have whole milk.  Right, but there's sugar in it.  That's it.  There's sugar in the milk, though.  Yeah, he said the milk is fine only once a day.  What?  He didn't say anything about the brisket?  Oh, no, because it has brown sugar.  Fuck.  Brown sugar's better than white sugar.  That's in the milk.  I don't think so. 
[03:12:00]  Well, maybe so.  We just don't have a mix of those two in the same bowl.  A malata sugar.  Yeah.  A malata mango sugar.  Both sugars will be destroyed.  I got tricked at eating the brisket.  Always.  The brisket.  There's fucking brown sugar on that shit.  Oh, shit.  That was good.  Oh, I had a piece.  That was good stuff.  We got an opera singer who can't work because she farts a lot after an operation. 
[03:12:30]  This is a great story, man.  Yeah?  She, what?  When she sings?  Opera diva claims her career might be over because she can't belt out big notes without  passing gas.  Oh, because she pushes them.  This is a real story, man.  Singer Amy Herbst is suing an army hospital over allegedly botching a procedure that's  forced her off stage with chronic incontinence and flatulence.  Oh, because she shits herself, too?  She's shitting herself when she hits the big notes, I guess.  Oh, God.  Her husband must fucking hate her. 
[03:13:00]  Oof.  God, that's got to fuck.  She's pretty hot, too.  Is this her?  Yeah.  She just got hotter, as far as I'm concerned.  Cutting gassers and shit all over the place.  She's a fucking keeper.  The injury happened when she was giving birth.  They had to fucking cut her open.  Yeah, but the episiotomy was given by...  Episiotomy.  They cut you from the puss to the ass.  Oh, God.  But the nurse wasn't authorized or something like that?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think the nurse just went in there with some scissors.  The kid had a big head.  Jesus.  No physician.  Wow. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  Okay, you're right.  Yeah, the doctor wasn't involved, basically, with this.  Oh, man.  And they didn't repair it properly, supposedly.  Yeah, the nurse fucked up, but they shoot it in there with a chainsaw.  A license plate from Louisiana came out.  Exactly.  I love how they write things in the paper.  Yeah.  The botched procedure has caused Amy Herbst to experience fecal urgency.  Oh.  That sounds like something we've all had.  Yeah, her shit knocks on her colon.  The way fucking Angel Salazar was trying to get into Tony's office.  Including periodic leaking of stool and excessive flatulence. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Keep going.  Keep breathing.  I'm off.  Damn.  So, I guess the sphincter muscle was damaged.  Right.  That holds, you know, that's the seal there.  Like, when you're holding a fart or a shit, like, that's the fucking last resort.  That's the Alamo. 
[03:14:30]  We're going to pull back to the Alamo.  If she's saying, she can hold in her farts.  I don't know.  She can hold them in.  I don't think so.  She got that ring.  That sphincter ring was damaged, so it can't get that nice, tight seal.  Her ass holding, it looks like that fucking tube now in Shawshank at the end.  There's just fucking nonsense and bile leaking out of it.  Andy Dufresne came flying out.  Exactly.  That's what her fucking colon ring looks like now.  It all just runs right down into her socks. 
[03:15:00]  She had a part in Madame Butterfly, and she's suing for 2.5.  That stuff's flying out of her butt.  Oh, gee.  Poor woman.  Damn, that would seem to be a problem.  But wouldn't that help ticket sales?  Where you got an opera singer that can visit at any second?  Oh, my.  Nice diuretic evacuation in the middle of the big song.  You're going to bring a whole new audience to opera, right?  That big note.  Dude, I went to the fucking mic-er-ass.  Yeah, part of the fucking opera.  You ever go to opera?  I went once, and it was horrendous. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I don't mind some singing.  See, I would go.  Singing that doesn't make sense.  If the chick was going to fart, you know, as she's singing, I would go.  But no.  In a second, you would go.  Someone should fucking, you know, set her up nice in an opera house.  Yeah.  The tickets would fucking sell well.  If they mic'd their ass.  Right.  And she sang.  Oh.  She should just go with it.  Have a good time with it.  I get there an hour early.  Yeah.  Right at the high note.  Get a good seat.  She takes that Viking helmet off and shoves the horn up her ass.  Plug it up. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  I'd pay to see that.  Her asshole sounds like a Ricola commercial.  It's just porn.  Yeah.  Oh, that's so great.  Oh, the poor woman.  What are you going to do?  Do we have a news story on this?  Can't fix that?  No.  No.  Yeah.  Why can't they just go in there and sew the fucking thing?  Do you think they could tighten that shit up a little bit for her?  Tighten it up.  Throw a rubber band in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She can wear a bag if she had to.  Oh, man.  That would be terrible.  Just diapers.  And then finally. 
[03:16:30]  Hope her husband doesn't have to ass fucking.  Oh, jeez.  That's terrible.  It's all loose now.  Yeah.  We're in her box.  Oh.  Oh, this is from Red Eye.  Oh, it's the Red Eye.  All right.  An opera singer claims her career might be over because she's unable to sing without farting.  Amy Hurt.  She's pretty hot.  That's all you need to say, really.  Poor girl.  The poor lady.  I'm embarrassing.  Her pictures everywhere.  Allegedly botching a surgery that took place when she was giving birth as a result of her excessive 
[03:17:00]  flatulence.  Hurt has been unable to work as a professional opera singer.  They're seeking two and a half million dollars in damages.  Pan, I'm thinking, you know, you work in Vegas.  Shouldn't she embrace this?  It's like, now she's an opera singer with a bonus.  Well, there's Lepetomene, which is the act that we always talk about of a guy who was  able to fart.  Yes.  And some people have said that that's also a false, and that's an apocryphal thing.  But I don't know.  I mean, how, I mean, this is an indelicate question, I suppose, but how close is the audience 
[03:17:30]  to it?  That's true.  Well, that could be, Dan, you could actually pay more.  You pay attention to the closer.  It could be salt with ventilation.  Yes, too.  Also, opera singers sing really, really loud.  Right.  It's not like you'd listen to some, you know, mumbling, quiet folks.  But it would be great, though, because Dan, she'd be singing, and it'd be like she'd be  accompanying herself with a horn.  You'll get the guy with the flute and the horse.  What about, where's Bill, by the way? 
[03:18:00]  I'm having a Bill Schultz.  He's gone from the show.  I know he's gone, but why?  I don't know.  I haven't heard hide nor hair of why he's not on the show anymore.  People want to know what happened to him.  Yeah, I don't know.  No clue.  That's not even worth it for her to even file a lawsuit with a republic like this.  No, it's just too embarrassing.  She's the one like, oh, you're the farting, shitting thing herself, girl.  Not for fucking two and a half million, when you're fucking, you're, yeah.  Yeah, that better be 20 mil.  Your underwear looks like a fucking, the bottom of a soup bowl.  With fucking vaginal juices, shit, and gas leaking into your fucking panties. 
[03:18:30]  You know what would be great?  Like, whatever town she lives in, she's in the supermarket, you follow around with a  lighter, just waiting for her to fire.  She can light it on fire.  Just for the fun.  Just have it fucking lit and follow her on the supermarket until she cuts one.  It's probably the lawyers for the opera house just shaming her, so she drops the lawsuit.  We're going to put your picture everywhere now.  She's known as the farting opera singer.  That's great.  And finally, a teen, wow, parachute fails, and she falls, and she's alive. 
[03:19:00]  This is crazy.  Fucking broke her vertebrae.  Yeah.  She broke everything.  Yeah.  A Texas teenager skydiving trip to celebrate her 16th birthday turned nearly fatal when  her parachute failed to open, and she spun 3,500 feet to the ground.  Can you imagine what's going through your mind as you fall 3,500 feet?  How did she not die?  What slowed her down?  I mean, I guess the string behind it?  It came out.  The parachute came out, but it was tangled, so she had a little bit of drag on her.  A little bit?  She was spinning. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  And then the place there says, you know, it came out, she just didn't do the proper  procedure for the reserve chute.  Yeah.  So she just, you know, she was supposed to pull a reserve chute.  She didn't do that, so she hit the ground.  She must have been going pretty fast.  There's no video.  No, I guess not.  She went with her father.  Father lands safely.  For her birthday.  Don't give people dangerous things for their birthday, because, like, they feel obligated  to do it, even if they're scared.  And then if something bad happens, you're like the guy that killed the person. 
[03:20:00]  And every year, I'm asked, you want to go skydiving?  No.  The answer's the same as the last time you asked me.  Let's go bungee jumping for fucking your birthday, and it's like, oh, right, I killed  him on his birthday by giving him a bungee jump.  Broke her vertebrae, shattered her pelvis, so she landed that way.  I would like to do that to her.  She shattered that fucking pelvis.  Deep stroking.  And led to internal bleeding, but she didn't die from that.  Fuck.  She looks all right, but she's breathing on her own, they said, so hopefully she's not 
[03:20:30]  paralyzed.  The picture we're looking at, she looks all right.  Yeah, I think her body's pretty fucked up.  I mean, internal shit, but, man, it all depends on how you fucking hit the ground.  You know, you turned a little different one way or the other way.  Don't hit the head.  It's just, yeah, yeah, you can't fucking smash your head open, or, you know, too many  organs getting fucking damaged.  It was probably good that she shattered her pelvis, absorbed a lot of energy.  They're blaming her at the end of this article.  Yeah, they say she didn't pull her chute.  Yeah, you did say that, I'm sorry. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, the parachute company, whatever, the skydiving company, said that Mackenzie did  not follow the training on how to activate a second chute that was given prior to her  jump.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm supposed to keep calm as I'm spinning out of control toward the earth.  Yeah, she's 16 years old.  Right.  Oh, it's her fault.  It's odd that they, uh...  It was her first time skydiving, and it wasn't a tandem jump.  Right.  Has she done a tandem or no?  I don't think so.  Wait, she was by herself?  Obviously, if she didn't pull her fucking reserve.  With parental consent.  Yeah, okay, no shit, she was by herself. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's fucked up.  Maybe she did tandems right now.  I don't know.  I don't know.  They were saying it was a first time for a birthday or something.  Yeah, like that her father, when she turned 16, decided he was going to take a skydiving.  I guess they have places.  You know, Texas is a fun place.  Of course she was by herself.  You can do whatever you want there.  Yeah, come on, parachute.  Shoot guns on the way down.  We don't give a shit.  It's Texas.  Wow.  Yeah, so, you know, you're falling.  All of a sudden, your shoot doesn't work, and you're like, I'm alone up here.  I don't know.  You're going to panic.  You're panicky little Pete. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  We've got to get out of here.  Amazing.  Another bang-up show, huh?  Yeah.  Hope people like the eating segment.  Oh, shit.  Hold on a minute.  What?  For real.  Hold on a minute.  Are you going to breakfast with Nosferatu out there?  Dude, hold on.  He's been calling all morning.  Oh, yeah?  Fuck.  Hold on a second.  He's been calling all morning.  You're kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding.  You sure couldn't.  Oh, no.  What a nice way to end the show if this gets pulled off. 
[03:22:30]  True.  Don't leave.  Good morning.  Paul.  I was just tweeting about my most lightning alarm clock in the world.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  He's on the air.  Tell me he's on the air, too.  Paul, you're on the air.  It's Paul Williams, everyone.  He's been calling back all morning.  We tried calling earlier to congratulate him on the big Grammy win.  You know why I called you guys a few minutes ago on the WDF TV show?  I was tweeting about having the world's most frightening alarm clock in the future of the  three of us.  Yeah, you are.  Which I would still will. 
[03:23:00]  No, I'm still calling you guys.  Thank you.  I mean, how about that?  I'm going to be here at age 73.  It must be on time.  It's amazing.  And we forget about that time difference.  So, I mean, you know, it seemed like a good time for us to call.  Trust me, the phone was turned off.  Oh, okay.  Good.  I didn't get the call.  But as soon as I turned it on, I saw you guys and called, and that's so cool.  I really appreciate it.  I love, you know, I love the chance to say thanks to Daft Punk for, you know, for not  being ageist, for grabbing an old guy and saying, come make a record. 
[03:23:30]  You looked great.  Your speech, too, was really good.  It was funny.  And, you know, you didn't look like you were up there at a loss for words.  I didn't pass out and throw up.  Right.  Yeah.  I didn't do it.  Yeah, that could be embarrassing.  I was so touched by the wedding.  And then that song, Save Love, was so beautiful.  And it was just...  Oh, we loved that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we thought that was the hit of the night.  We loved that part.  That Macklemore is a hell of a guy. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a terrific human being.  We love him.  It was an amazing moment there on the Grammys.  But we didn't want to call you right away.  We figured we'd give you a couple days with your real pals and your family and stuff.  And then, you know, we'd get our congratulations in.  Well, I love that.  I'm actually out here with the airport on my way back to New York.  Would you try to warm it up before I get there?  I'm in the car on the way to the airport.  Oh, good luck.  I can check it.  It's 14 degrees.  Yeah, it's a little cold.  It's going to warm up a little bit. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  It's going to warm up a bit.  What, are you going to the Super Bowl or something?  Say again?  What are you doing in New York?  Super Bowl or some other stuff?  You know, I'm writing a book called Gratitude and Trust.  Recovery is Not Just for Addicts with my friend Tracy Jackson.  It'll be out in September on table.  We have a website called gratitudeandtrust.com where you can check on what it's all about.  It's about being able to share in a humorous fashion some of the things that have led to  my being able to put my life's shiny side up again and all. 
[03:25:00]  So, you know, you notice I've never missed an opportunity to plug something.  Of course.  That's fine, though.  I work on the book.  And, of course, you know, I've got ASCAP work in New York, too.  You know, I'm still, you know, my day job is I'm president and chairman of the board of ASCAP.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  You know, you did a great young woman.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He just hung up. 
[03:25:30]  I thought it was a bad connection.  No, he just.  Why?  Because it was pretty clear and then it just went to nothing.  We're good, you know.  He was on his way to the airport and I couldn't really hear him.  You were helping him out, right?  Yeah, I was helping him out a little bit.  Love you missed you.  Love you missed you, Paul Williams.  You got the story anyway, didn't you?  Yeah, we did.  Yes, you know.  What a great sound.  I didn't have the balls to hang up while I was talking about his recovery book, so I do have a little heart in there.  Paul Williams, our pal.  He's a very sober guy. 
[03:26:00]  I really, I like Paul.  He won a Grammy with Daft Punk.  Yeah.  He closed the Grammys, basically, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Good guy.  Well, Nine Inch Nails was, Trent Reznor was the host of it.  Oh, yeah, he was pissed.  I thought that was the house band.  Yeah, the house band.  That's just the bumper band.  Yeah, they fucking cut them off.  Oops.  Trent Reznor, that goes?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, do they.  There's Trent Reznor.  Who else was in there?  Trent Reznor.  Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age.  Right.  How did they cut that off?  Because they finally said, fuck it.  And it was at a weird time. 
[03:26:30]  It was like 1148 or something.  Yeah.  So they had plenty of time.  Yeah.  But they said, ah, this is good enough.  Yeah, we got it.  We got it.  They pulled a Paul Williams on him.  Right.  They did.  Should we call him back?  We're good?  Hey, that's your fucking problem to deal with.  Shit, he just called.  Oh, fuck.  He just called back.  For real.  Call back and ask him why he hung up on you.  He really just called back.  Find out why he hung up on you.  I think he just texted him.  Sorry about that.  So mean.  Oh, the guy's so nice.  He's great. 
[03:27:00]  Nice success.  Fucking.  Paul.  Yes.  We got to get you a new phone, man.  What's going on with that?  You know what?  There's one little place on the 405 freeway.  No, there's not.  Even if you talk to the president and we're being under attack and he wants to know the  code in terms of to send out the bomb or whatever, you will leave the call.  You weren't at that spot.  Believe me.  You were on the Opie freeway.  I think you owe us a bit of an apology because the audience didn't, you know, they were into 
[03:27:30]  it and then your phone was crappy.  You know, I know.  It just, well, you know, it kind of puts things back and down.  You know, it reminds everybody that I am Paul Williams.  You can take the D away from the front of my name.  I go from D Paul Williams.  He's a little guy with a crappy phone.  Yeah, but, you know, Paul, sometimes what I do, I know if I'm in a bad area, I'll stop  the car and pull over just so I don't drop the call.  So that's something you probably could have done. 
[03:28:00]  True.  You actually drive yourself once a while to your day and allow that again.  That's fantastic.  How about a little sorry and we'll be good with it.  Yeah.  But anyway, thanks for the call.  All right.  All right, Paul.  Have a safe flight.  Love you.  Miss you, brother.  See you soon.  All right.  Here's a water cup.  We need to go on it.  All right.  Thank you.  That's fucking great.  We got it, buddy. 
[03:28:30]  He's awesome, William.  He is awesome.  He's a good friend.  That's great.  We're going to love you, miss you t-shirts come out.  Love you, mister.  Oh, my God.  That's my brother's, actually.  I can't even take a friend for that one.  My husband's been saying that forever.  I got to get out of here.  I can't even hang out with fucking Dr. Doom and his brother.  Clarentine, what do you got, buddy?  Tomorrow through Saturday, Magoobie's Jokehouse, Timoney in Maryland.  February 6th, Improv, West Palm Beach, Florida.  The 7th, Open Stage Club, Coral Gables, Florida.  February 8th, Sunrise Theater, Fort Pierce.  And Philly at the end of February, outside of Philly, Phoenixville and Bethlehem. 
[03:29:00]  Good, man.  Get Florentine.com.  Fucking killer fucking set today, man.  Florentine killed it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I have Atlantic City, one show still has tickets.  That's the late show, February 15th, which has been added.  And in D.C., the only shows with tickets available are Thursday the 6th.  And the Friday late show on the 7th.  The other ones are sold out.  And February 28th, I return to Pittsburgh, Munn Hall, Pennsylvania.  The Carnegie Music Hall. 
[03:29:30]  So I'm actually looking forward to that gig.  Who cares?  Why would I say that?  Chuck McGinnelly's going to come down.  Is he?  Yeah.  And don't forget about our podcast.  This week it's Super Puke starring Bob Kelly.  It's a good one.  People are already raving about it.  So go get that, all right?  See you guys tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony show is drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show. 
[03:30:00]  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments.  This is not an offering to sell a franchise.  Franchise offerings are made for the franchise.  Let's go.  The Opie and Anthony post show is含ou, right?  The Opie, right?  electrolytes can be referred in moments of today's show that it's fine with a list of metal comigo.  So in fact, you must leave a list for the franchise.  You must be led by two that are 충� yesterday.  So as I'm connected to a previous csator, I'm just going to good enough to make a little bit mention of how I'm kissing.  That's all right.  miners came out so beautifully gegeben up and would just submit it so many different languages into the story andonda 뽑 was loose. 
[03:30:30]  I know it's sobie that addicted to it.  What it used to be?  How the rest of the franchise and what were supposed to be on?  They're going to do with us today's show and I'd never say I think there is something we should get yourself done tonight here. </pre>
