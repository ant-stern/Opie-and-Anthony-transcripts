<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the cancellation of a scheduled Cronut chef's appearance.  Producer Roland canceled it due to the chef's wife's concerns over negative online comments, specifically tweets referencing "cum nuts," a misinterpretation stemming from a previous segment satirizing Cronut knockoffs.  The hosts clarified their intent was to promote, not denigrate, the chef.  This led to a discussion about their comedic style and relationship with Roland.  Opie then launched into a furious rant about Obamacare, detailing his own policy's cancellation and using highly offensive language to criticize the President and the system, particularly its perceived unfairness towards those without children.  Numerous listener calls followed, echoing Opie's frustrations.  He also recounted a humorous anecdote about meeting Ozzy Osbourne after a Black Sabbath concert.

The show continued with angry and sarcastic commentary on government policies, using highly offensive language regarding race and weight, and criticizing healthcare premiums and subsidized plans.  Amy Schumer was announced as a later guest, prompting a discussion about the "Obama Kool-Aid" trope and further political grievances, followed by commentary on a video of Don Baylor's and Bill de Blasio's clumsy first pitch performances.  The hosts then dissected the NHL's supposed Stanley Cup "theft" publicity stunt, engaging in hypothetical scenarios of stealing the cup themselves.

A significant portion focused on their outrage over planned interruptions at their upcoming "Unmasked" show with Ron Bennington.  They vehemently criticized the company's plan to have celebrities present them with cupcakes as a 20th-anniversary gesture, deeming it insulting and a sign of indifference to their show's success.  They highlighted the lack of promotional support and revealed the plan was made without their input.  A call with Paul Williams revealed his shared displeasure with the cupcake idea.  The segment concluded with continued outrage over the company's decisions.

The broadcast then delved into a rambling discussion, starting with a joke about Oscar Pistorius delivering cupcakes, leading to discussions about a lack of guests and Donnie McClendon's answering machine message.  They discussed their upcoming "Unmasked" live show, debating venue size and a potential meet-and-greet. A lengthy discussion followed regarding Nick Cannon's "whiteface" appearance and the ensuing controversy, debating the double standard surrounding racial impersonations and white privilege, with extended discussion of blackface in America. This was followed by a pre-recorded bit about "dumb aspirin" and a segment monitoring another radio show, highlighting comedic snippets.

Amy Schumer then joined the studio.  The ensuing conversation covered her stand-up experiences, including advice from Chris Rock and a bad show in Buffalo.  Anecdotes included a Fourth of July party with Keith Robinson's drunken ocean encounter and the damage to Schumer's mother's house from Hurricane Sandy.  They discussed a prank on Joe DeRosa, promotion of Schumer's Comedy Central show, a bad review criticizing her use of bleeps, and comments about her appearance and relationship status.  Schumer shared stories about a photo with Paul McCartney, an earthquake experience in LA, her upcoming Judd Apatow film, Colin Quinn's Twitter activity, dealing with online criticism, a funny encounter with Scott Greenstein, and a mugging incident where her driver's license was mailed back.

Finally, a caller named "Di" recounted a mugging in Newark, New Jersey.  The hosts, however, focused more on her seemingly erratic behavior and past experiences, including multiple muggings in the 80s, her horrid drunk driving, a bizarre encounter with her landlord "Greg" involving explicit sexual acts for rent (with Greg potentially present during the call), and her birthday.  The conversation devolved into increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit banter, with mentions of Bob Levy and a mysterious "president" on the phone.  The segment concluded with Di's invitation for Anthony to take her to dinner, met with more vulgar jokes, a brief mention of guest host Dennis Falcone, and the aforementioned mysterious caller identifying himself as "the president".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  He cancelled him?  I don't know.  This is fucking bizarre.  I love it.  He cancelled him.  There's no way he cancelled him.  Is he here yet?  Roland, yes.  Roland cancelled the Cronut guy?  I don't know for sure.  We have so much to talk about.  Obamacare.  Jimmy at Black Sabbath. 
[00:00:30]  Cupcakes.  Old radio clips.  But I'm finding out just as we hit these microphones that Roland cancelled the Cronut guy.  The Cronut guy was supposed to come in today with some Cronuts and the chocolate chip cookies and milk.  Right.  Shot glasses that he makes.  And because of yesterday, I guess, there was a problem?  I don't think we disrespected the Cronut guy.  I think the underlying thing was that we were protecting the guy.  The whole payoff.  Yeah, it was a...  And then there was a payoff. 
[00:01:00]  We were mocking the fact that so many people are ripping them off.  Right.  And then the payoff, when we got the knockoff Cronuts, was that they were so bad we couldn't even eat them.  They were so bad, so dry.  End of story.  And they were from Crumbs, which is an established bakery.  That was the worst.  I never liked Crumbs in general.  I like Magnolias over Crumbs.  The Cronut.  But they do very well out there in the bake world.  Well, there's words from there.  I think Roland was worried.  Here comes Roland now. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, good.  The Cronut guy called.  Oh, did he?  He's bringing moon rocks.  Oh, no.  I can't do this to that.  Now, the Cronut guy was bringing moon rocks.  April Falls.  Oh, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.  Okay, then.  Anyway, it truly is April Falls.  Our careers have truly fallen off the map.  From having the entire city talk about our April Fool's jokes to that shit.  April Falls.  You don't think Edgar is the same?  Fuck.  This is Edgar's day. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, you got a long day ahead of your voice.  Roland, explain yourself to us, please.  Hello, Mr. Innocence.  Roland, comment?  Jesus Christ.  But Roland, what happened?  Did you really cancel the Cronut guy?  You know, like your brother's chefs are very, very sensitive to their food and their creation.  I don't think you even talked to the Cronut guy.  I think you panicked and you canceled them on us.  No, I talked to him.  His wife was worried because people online showed her, like, cum nuts, like, tweets of cum nuts and that.  Cum nuts.  What's cum nuts?  Yes, he said cum nuts.  So people tweeted him.  I don't think anybody thought he made cum nuts. 
[00:02:30]  They don't, but he was online and he showed it to his wife.  And she's worried because he's a chef.  He's not a...  We were going to break this down today.  With the Cronut guy and help him out.  He's not used to this world.  Did you tell him about the payoff was the fact that the Cronuts that we got from crumbs sucked ass and we said it.  He understood that, but he just didn't understand the world.  Like, that's his passion.  Did he cancel or did you cancel?  He said, I felt uncomfortable.  I said, just forget that.  No, that's when you explained it to him. 
[00:03:00]  You've been in this world way longer than him.  We're not going to ruin your friendship.  Oh, God.  Really?  Oh, Roland.  Roland.  You completely misread this.  We're not going to ruin your friendship with the Cronut guy.  I love the guy.  That happened before to me.  By the way, Sam Roberts basking in the controversy.  He's smiling.  He loves shit like that.  I've been to the Cronut house.  The guy is awesome.  He treats me like a rock star.  I know, but he was panicked.  We were going to break it down today, and obviously his stuff would have been delicious.  And talk about how his Cronuts transcend all other Cronuts. 
[00:03:30]  He was worried because I don't understand the world.  I understand your point slightly, but that's when you step in and go, whoa, dude, I've been  in this world a long time.  Don't worry about it.  These guys got your back, which we do.  Well, after yesterday, Dean, you're back.  After yesterday.  Like you said, the payoff was that we got a knockoff.  We got the knockoff Cronut, and they sucked, and we said that it sucked.  And his are better, of course, but that was like the payoff of the whole thing.  It's not too late. 
[00:04:00]  I'm sure I'll get you guys Oreos and anemones and Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, no.  I don't make you Wishes Come True to make you happy.  We don't understand the bit.  It's just business, and Roland's taking this very personal.  It's Roland.  We have his back.  You know that.  Of course.  You go, oh, no.  Fuck him.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We were going to have this guy in.  I would have been very nice to him, but you canceled him because you were worried we were  going to fuck with your personal connection.  A, I wouldn't have done that to you.  Yeah, that's kind of an insult, right? 
[00:04:30]  You can glare at me, but I wouldn't have done that to you.  Right.  We would not have done that.  There's a difference.  Oh, no.  My bad.  I don't know.  He wasn't comfortable, so I was like, never forget it.  I don't want to have anybody comfortable.  No, but you should explain it to him.  You should have explained it to him, man.  We were excited to see the guy in his cookie shots, and the cronauts would have been amazing.  Yes.  And we could have maybe had a real...  He hasn't had a real interview about the fact that the whole world is taking his invention.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  He was worried.  So I was like, all right.  I don't want to worry him or his wife.  So I was like, all right, never mind.  Oh, my God.  So we'll talk to you soon, yeah.  Oh, no.  You know better.  Oh, no.  You know better.  What happened now?  What happened?  We would never do that to you.  Sam, obnoxious comment.  No.  Sam's like, no, I know how this fucking shit works out.  He's too busy looking cool over there.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him with denim.  It's all about denim.  Can't wait for you to check out your outfit 10 years from now.  You're like a Rowdy Roddy, and they live. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Cool as fuck.  How about we try to rebook them?  All right.  Yeah, he's worried.  So I'm like, all right.  We got his back, Rowland.  I know, but you panicked on us.  You were worried.  I was like, all right.  He does the Cronuts.  We do the radio.  Just tell him that's how we do it.  Right.  And it was a crescendo build.  It built into a crescendo of how good his Cronuts are.  We basically told the world that everyone else's Cronuts are shit.  Because we picked an established company, too.  It wasn't the ShopRite one. 
[00:06:00]  No.  It wasn't the one at the gas station.  Is he a prima donna?  No.  It's just his wife was worried because his wife protects all the stuff.  So name donna.  See, people are shocked.  Everyone knows you were just busting your balls yesterday.  But when he was worried, I was like, yeah.  You're just breaking your balls right away.  You're getting fucking fresh.  We're just busting balls.  But in the end, we have his back.  That's the difference.  So when he's worried, I'm like, all right, don't worry.  He's all right.  No, but that's when you've got to explain what we do. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, boy.  We would give him a lot of great promotion.  Yeah, we talked about the guy for an hour yesterday.  Well, that was because we ran out of material, but we still talked about him for an hour.  Yeah, that's true.  Right.  Hour-long fucking commercial, and it ended with the big payoff.  Right.  And Nick Cannon, go fuck yourself.  Oh, shit.  He's going to explain the difference between humor and hatred to everybody.  Wait till we get to that story.  Oh, what a dickbag.  I've had it with him.  Your boy, Nick Cannon, stinks. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, see?  Your boy, Nick Cannon, stinks, Sam.  He's a fucking fraud.  He is a fraud.  Wait till we get to the cupcakes.  Oh, boys, this is going to be a fun day.  Strap in, kids.  And please, I have my Obamacare thing I want to talk about, Sam.  Sure.  But first, let's...  Do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do, because yesterday was the, you know, the limit.  That's it.  It was the fucking deadline to get signed up.  Wait, wait, wait, because that's going to be at least 20 minutes.  Oh, I know.  You're going to go and try to re-book the guy? 
[00:07:30]  Sure.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's B-mad.  Don't book him.  If you're worried that we're going to wreck your friendship with the guy, then don't book him.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  And the fact that we would have that guy on and still have a nice time with him, he was in here one time.  Nobody fucked with him.  He would have had a good time.  We haven't fucked with one of the people you brought in and been mean to them.  I said, sure.  Yeah, but I hear how you're saying sure.  Sure.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Rolling.  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, this is...  You read it wrong. 
[00:08:00]  Hmm?  You read it wrong.  We're being punished.  Don't get the panda angry.  This is punishment for that shit yesterday.  You should make something like that.  This is punishment.  How am I punished?  Because you were annoyed at what we were doing, and this is like, well, fuck these guys.  They want to talk to me.  You knew we were kidding.  It just, I guess, said, oh, well, I don't know how it plays.  I was like, okay, don't worry about it.  Yeah, but you know the show, and you know us, and maybe you were worried we were going  to blow up your friendship.  And we knew exactly where that bit was leading, by the way.  That's how great we are.  Oh, yeah.  We knew in the end it was going to be a big fuck you to the rest of the world.  Right.  And your pal was going to come up, come, uh, yeah. 
[00:08:30]  I knew those crumb cronuts were going to suck asshole.  Right.  And they did.  Worse than I even expected.  Yeah.  That was the worst cronut ever.  It's not even a real cronut.  And you've had a lot of them, right?  I've had cronuts all around the world.  Oh, I've been everywhere, man.  Oh, boy.  You were worried?  His wife was worried, so I was like, don't worry about it.  I said, well, we'll just put this on hold. 
[00:09:00]  Why?  She was worried, so he canceled it.  We kind of understand everyone's relationships around here.  We kind of look out for each other, even though we'd fucking beat the shit out of each other  and throw each other under the bus.  We would never fuck with your relationship with the guy.  Yeah, I just thought, okay, don't worry, we'll put on hold and we'll come back.  She was like Fredo's wife at the fucking wedding.  Yeah.  If that's the case.  Hey, you take care of it, Mike.  I truly believe you canceled the guy.  No, he, that's fine, but she called and said she was worried.  I think you got really mad yesterday, and then you canceled the guy. 
[00:09:30]  She was worried, and I said, don't worry.  I said, we'll put on hold and we'll come back later.  So that's how I did it.  Someone actually online showed her something.  I don't know if that's true.  The tweets.  That's why she worried.  Who tweeted?  Who tweeted who?  A lot of people tweeted.  It's hard to get his Twitter.  No?  Yeah, it is.  You've got to know his whole name.  A lot of fans tweeted at him.  What's his Twitter?  I don't know his Twitter.  Dominic Ansell.  Uh-oh.  That probably wasn't smart right there. 
[00:10:00]  No, that's on you.  That probably wasn't a smart thing.  That's on you.  That's on you.  You know, wow.  These fans can be a little rambunctious.  We're scared of our own fans.  That's on you.  Yes, indeedy do.  Did you hurt Roland's feelings?  Come on.  At this point, he's got to know you're just busting balls.  We're just busting balls.  Yeah.  Does that mean you guess what?  We never at one...  This is what would have been the difference.  Never at one time did we say his stuff sucks.  Never.  And throughout the entire bit, we were talking about how great his stuff is. 
[00:10:30]  How great his stuff is.  How it's being ripped off all around the globe.  And then at the end, how much worse the Renacov sucks.  That would have been a fuck you to you.  Oh, yeah.  If we started making fun of his actual, you know, his actual product.  I think it was great.  Which we didn't do.  I think it was.  I think it was a nice presentation of his cronut making abilities.  Right.  Anything.  Was there a lot of Opie and Anthony mentions?  Oh, boy.  Sam.  I'm looking.  Uh-huh.  See, I don't believe that his wife saw a tweet that we were trashing. 
[00:11:00]  She was worried, so she called, so I was like, all right.  Well, so you didn't say, like, the guy, ask us and go, look, guys, he's a little worried.  Will it be cool or are you guys going to break him?  It was after the show, so.  So you could have texted us.  Did you explain it to her, maybe?  And say, hey.  I told you, no, I just said, don't worry.  Then we'll revisit it another time.  Oh, no.  That's it.  Cool.  Well, if you want to rebook him, we would certainly like that.  All right.  I thought I just told you to revisit it another time. 
[00:11:30]  That's all.  I'll go down and talk to him in person and just explain everything.  You don't have to go down on it.  You don't have to go down.  I will.  Roland takes his food very seriously.  I know.  I then talked to him for, hey, this is how it was and that.  But we weren't doing anything malicious, that's for sure.  We were doing something delicious.  Yeah.  Talking about the Corona.  Oh, you found something, Sammy?  There's a few.  I am?  Are they reasonable? 
[00:12:00]  A couple of saying untimed things about Roland.  Oh.  And then a couple of people asking if Dunkin' Donuts is going to be in the studio.  Come on.  That's kind of funny.  Because it's such a contrast to the actual, you know.  And they're just going with the bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Right.  They're just going with the bit.  Not much beyond that.  I mean, very unkind things about Roland.  I don't think that's necessary.  Oh, that's not even nice at all.  Nah.  All right.  Well, whatever you want to do, Roland. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  But.  When this tweet says, Opie and Anthony completely shitting on Cronut Guy.  That's sweet.  That's a lie.  That's a lie.  I believe that's a lie.  We didn't.  So, you know, people tweet things and they're stupid.  That's got to be understood.  We weren't shitting on him at all.  Yep.  No.  All right.  Well, if you want to rebook him, great.  If not, at least you know where we're coming from.  All right.  All right.  And I don't think he should be on the fucking Sam Roberts post show there because Sam was 
[00:13:00]  really shitting on him.  What is that?  To tell you the truth, he was like, oh, look at this.  Yeah, Sam found all the info.  Oh, look, the Philippines.  Remember that, Sam Roberts?  Right.  Remember?  Oh, yeah, look.  Look, here's in fucking L.A.  Look, look.  You really made it hurt.  Look how easy it is to make a Cronut.  You remember saying that?  I remember.  We actually played a clip on the pre-show where you can literally hear,  I hope you say, Sam, keep finding those.  Oh, now.  Nice.  Now he's fucking.  Real nice.  Now he's fucking pushing your head underwater. 
[00:13:30]  Nice.  Real nice.  To catch his breath.  Nice.  You're a rat.  Fucking rat.  We're family rats.  You're a rat.  You've been a rat someday.  Anyway.  All right, Roland.  Good luck to you.  Dilemma number one for today in the books.  Taken care of.  The what?  Dilemma number one we've taken care of today.  All right.  It's a dilemma.  Oh, boy.  He's not happy.  Give the fuck.  Give the fuck. 
[00:14:00]  Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Look at him.  He is not happy stopping down the hall.  We should just not do it.  It's not even a knock on Dominic.  You know, Dominic.  You know, I'm sure he's a nice guy.  Maybe these worlds just don't mix.  Like, we all like his food.  But if that's the way it is, then maybe these worlds just don't mix.  Fuck the way it is.  I just want to have a real interview with the guy.  Yeah, you know.  To see where his head's at with this whole thing.  Got a little bit of fame from his cronaut.  No one was talking about cronauts before Dominic Ansel.  Yeah.  And now everyone has some kind of form of the cronaut. 
[00:14:30]  Some type of cronaut.  But if Roland could have just asked us, like, look, guys, I'm friends with this guy.  His wife's a little worried.  Would you guys be cool?  Or are you going to break balls?  I'm just asking.  And then if we would have said, ah, I don't want to.  Then cancel him.  There was some panic that set in.  But he should have asked us.  Absolutely.  Some panic set in.  A little panicky Pete.  He protects his foodies.  He loves his food people.  Yeah, but he should have asked us.  We've always been very gracious to every food guy that has come in here.  I mean, we try to make our jokes because we can't make it into an actual food segment. 
[00:15:00]  As much as we make fun of the fact that we're just eating food on the air.  We do throw our jokes in there or try to.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  I'm fucking so angry.  I could fucking scream.  Oh, shit.  Scream, then.  I don't care about that guy.  I'm sure he's a nice dude.  I'm sure he'd be a good interview.  I want to hear you roar. 
[00:15:30]  I'm not that.  I'm not angry at all.  Why are you so angry?  Because it's fucking unprofessional to not ask us if we're going to be dicks or not.  Like, I could see if we said, yeah, fuck that guy.  We're going to kill him.  Right.  And then he goes, look, man.  I can't.  He's my friend.  I think we have a good history of not doing things like that.  Yeah, I think all of us take care of each other on a certain level.  Like, I know who's important to you.  I know who's important.  You know, right.  We know who's important to each other.  Yeah.  Right.  So that's what annoys me to think that we were going to just douche the guy.  Yeah.  Instead of sticking up for the show. 
[00:16:00]  That's true.  Wow.  Got the phones lit.  Phone is lit.  I hear you.  Priorities.  Is this Roland's April Fool's joke?  I thought of that, too.  Oh, April Fools.  He's the best.  April Fools.  April Fools.  I got fucking three hours of sleep.  I'm cranky.  Oh.  Yeah, but you had one of the best nights of your life.  I did.  How do you go from one of the best nights of your life to being cranky?  By not sleeping.  By not sleeping?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was an amazing night, but I'm just tired.  You went and saw Black Sabbath in Brooklyn.  They were as good as I've ever seen them.  How was the sound in that joint? 
[00:16:30]  You know, we worried about it, because I was florentied, of course, and we heard the sound  was not great there for shows, because it's so high.  Yeah, there's something that happens there, a little echoey or something, especially if  you're, like, sitting further back.  Oh.  It was unbelievable.  I saw it during the sound check.  Yeah.  It was...  Privileged.  Ozzy sounded great.  Yeah.  I mean, well, I had to get there early, because, you know, Ozzy wants to get there early.  So I go early.  But it was...  Now, from that, I take away the fact that you went to the show with Ozzy.  Yeah, how am I supposed to get there?  Did he pick you up, or did you have to go to his hotel? 
[00:17:00]  I'm at the hotel.  It's funny.  Not only did I go, but I had to ask, hey, guys, can I get a ride?  I actually asked Black Sabbath for a ride.  Do you know how fucked up that is?  You spent your whole life stalking Black Sabbath, and now it's to the point where you're sitting  right next to Ozzy.  Yeah, not stalking.  I was admiring.  Admiring.  Well, we've seen the pictures over the years.  Stalking.  Yeah.  What's the one with the eyes again?  We haven't talked about that one in a while.  From MTV or something?  Oh, God, that was way old.  Yeah.  But you're like, what's the story there? 
[00:17:30]  I think it was one of your bits for a while.  Oh, fuck.  Whatever.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But they were tremendous.  They were tremendous.  Two-hour show.  Wow.  Ozzy was great.  Sold out?  Yeah.  I heard there was 300 tickets available as of yesterday morning.  That's pretty much a sellout.  It was mobbed.  Right.  I didn't see any open seats.  Wow.  Me and Jim stood in the sound booth.  Oh.  It was fucking great, man.  The sound booth on the floor?  Yeah.  We could have stood close to her backstage, but I just wanted to watch it.  Loved it.  Yeah.  Loved it.  Of course. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, it was fucking phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  It was a great night.  Look at Ozzy.  He looks great.  Fucking guy sounds great.  He's 65.  Jim's so logical.  Jim just states facts.  Yeah.  But Jim just states facts, and for some reason, it's just very interesting when he states  facts.  He's great.  Look at that.  It's a fucking microphone.  You're like, God, that's right.  He's absolutely right.  He's singing into a microphone.  It's great.  Yeah.  Without the speakers.  You wouldn't even fucking hear it.  You're like, God damn it, Jim's right.  What do you talk to Ozzy about on the way to the show? 
[00:18:30]  Anything?  Honestly, yesterday we talked about fucking nuclear fallout and reactor meltdowns.  Whoa.  Anyone that thinks, and Ozzy's not, you know, people are like, wow, does he really, because  he talks fast?  Uh-huh.  A hundred percent with it, with every single thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, we start talking about fucking sushi.  They just start talking about the Fukushima reactor.  Oh, right.  That's why it's bad on the West Coast.  We had a lovely chat.  Fucking up a sushi.  What's bad on the West Coast?  Sushi? 
[00:19:00]  Sushi because of the, a lot of the fishing.  Nuclear shit right there.  Where are they getting the sushi from, uh, for New York?  I don't know.  I don't know if they get it from New York.  It's like the Long Island Sound, that's for sure.  I think, uh, our stuff comes from what, the Gulf?  I don't know.  Is that what happens?  Is it a lot of stuff from the Gulf?  I have no idea.  I'm just speculating.  I think you go to Yasuda, they take it right from Japan, so that can't be good.  That's fucking scary.  You got an update?  You went down to, uh, Comfort Roland.  The perpetual shit-eating grin, as they say, is on Sam Roberts' face. 
[00:19:30]  As he comes back from the, the hall, because he had a, he had to poke his face in there  and see what's happening with Roland.  Right.  I just wanted to make sure Roland was okay.  Uh-huh.  But he did, he, I don't know, he told me the same thing he said on the air.  Oh, yeah?  And then he showed me the email of Dominique's wife being uncomfortable.  Oh, what did it say?  It was an email.  So he had proof.  I wish he would have told us he had proof.  Yeah.  Yeah, she, he, remember, it was the tweet that I read.  But who, who initiated it? 
[00:20:00]  Did Roland reach out to her, or did she reach out to Roland?  I saw an email.  She probably emailed him.  From his wife.  And what did it say?  It said, I just saw this on Twitter.  So.  And it was a link to somebody, to the guy saying that you guys were talking shit about him.  Oh, boy.  And her saying that it made her feel very uncomfortable.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, I'll say this, uh, to Roland, who's listening.  I'm sorry.  I didn't believe.  Oh.  I didn't believe that she actually, you know, saw something on Twitter.  I believe that I, that she reached out to him, or that she was uncomfortable, because 
[00:20:30]  that happens.  Right.  But my thing is, why didn't he just ask us off, like, text us, or try to?  If you, if I would have got a text from him that said, look, dude, he's a little, is  everything going to be cool?  And then I didn't respond.  That's one thing.  Right.  The only, the only bad thing from yesterday was the fact that we pointed out that the  cronut is everywhere.  Everywhere.  You know how hard that is to do as a, uh, a baker?  You're, you come up with something in your little store that does very well in the West  Village, and next thing you know, it's all over the world.  Everywhere.  And I would love to talk to him about that. 
[00:21:00]  Well, apparently not.  Yeah, and saying that the ShopRite brand and his cronut is the same was fairly heavily  laced with sarcasm.  Oh, absolutely.  I don't think anyone.  I really think, yes.  Yes.  Thought that was real.  And then the big reveal that the, the fake cronuts suck.  They were terrible.  It was worse than terrible.  When you went down to his place, all you did was rave about how good his place was.  Oh, it's amazing.  But, you know what I'm saying?  It's like.  And the guy, like, I went down there, I didn't want anything. 
[00:21:30]  And all of a sudden he goes, don't order, I want to order for you.  Oh.  And he, and he brought out a tray of almost every, the top selling desserts he has there.  Yeah.  There had to be ten things on my plate that we could try and sample.  It was amazing.  You spoke very nicely about it, too.  A lovely guy.  I've seen him, I've seen him a few times.  So.  All right.  So maybe he'll rebook them or maybe down the road or something.  You suffer for your cronuts.  Anything else about the Sabbath show, Jimmy? 
[00:22:00]  It was just a, it was just a great show.  I mean, uh, what can I say about it?  They did fucking obscure songs I never thought they would do.  They did shit off the new record and they sounded amazing.  You know, I saw them before in the hotel.  Well, you know how it is.  Oh.  But yeah.  But I'm really, I mean, I'm surprisingly well-behaved backstage.  Like, I stay out of the dressing rooms.  I don't fucking stare.  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, guys.  What are you wearing?  I leave them the fuck alone.  We get to the gig at like 3.30 and then I'm just hanging with Florentine the whole time,  walking around, talking to people, eating.  Uh-huh.  I hate backstage.  I used to.  Because I just always feel like I'm in someone's way. 
[00:22:30]  I'm like, what am I doing here?  So I sit off to the side and kind of like observe.  That's kind of fun, but you just know it's not, it's not your place, really.  I always do, but I finally have badges that actually do get me anywhere.  Badges.  No, it's different with you and Sabbath.  Trust me, you've interviewed them.  I mean, you guys are actual really, you know, close friends.  Well, I would be, yeah.  You're pretty close at this point.  Like, Sharon calls you every, a lot to do stuff for Ozzy and the band.  Well, it's not like you fucking hung out with them after the show or anything. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't think they're that close.  Well, look, here's the thing.  Huh?  What?  I did have to get back to the hotel some way.  Uh-huh.  I'm going to go back with fucking someone else.  It's rude.  Right, right.  It is rude.  So you went back with Ozzy and then back to the hotel room and hung out?  Not the hotel room.  It's just the lobby area.  Uh-huh.  I ordered some food.  Yeah, what do you do?  Oh, you ordered a little food?  Yeah.  I was hungry.  Did he order the bat?  Bat!  Get it?  Get it?  Because he...  Careful.  That's Jimmy's boy.  I know. 
[00:23:30]  I don't want to piss off more than one person today.  Careful.  About food.  No, he'd probably enjoy that if he said it.  Yeah, he probably would.  Well, he'd say it first.  I had the fucking bat.  I had the bat.  What?  Bat front chaise.  So you went back to the hotel and ate with Ozzy?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool, man.  And Sharon and, you know, some people that they really like people that work for them.  They're all, they're like a really nice crew of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did they laugh at any of your jokes?  Was there laughing going on?  Yeah, there was some actual frolicking and laughter and good natured joshing around. 
[00:24:00]  That's got to be cool.  Yeah.  He told me, I'm not going to repeat the joke because it was by a British, and I'm telling  you this because he's never, I never laugh when people relay jokes from other people.  And he told me a joke that a British comedian said, and it made me laugh for 20 minutes.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  I had quite a, I think he made me laugh harder than I made me laugh.  That's impressive.  It was lovely, yeah.  Lovely evening.  Well, we pointed out a few years ago that Ozzy's a very funny guy.  Yeah.  He's hilarious.  He's very funny.  Ozzy, Ozzy.  So, great night. 
[00:24:30]  So, I got home at one o'clock.  One?  I couldn't sleep right away.  Oh, were you an excited little boy?  No, I just...  Oh, Jimmy was all excited.  I couldn't sleep right away.  Oh, were you tossing and turning, thinking of your fun night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a couple hours.  Aw.  That's nice.  Adorable.  I never told Kenny what I wanted, did I?  Yes.  Yeah, you did.  It's an impossibility.  It's just been too many years.  I had no idea what I even said I wanted.  I don't know.  It's a surprise now.  Look at the president. 
[00:25:00]  Where?  Apple files.  Oh, Edgar, you got us.  Speaking of the president, Obamacare.  I, uh...  Can I ask the first basic question?  Throw out the first pitch.  Did my insurance get canceled?  And if it did, how do I know?  Because I swear I have no idea.  Opie?  I would have got something in the mail, right?  Maybe.  What do you mean maybe?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I got, like, kids and stuff, so I got the right coverage, no? 
[00:25:30]  Hey, who knows at this point, right?  I really don't know.  Here's the deal.  Yeah.  Yesterday was the, uh...  Deadline.  The deadline.  To sign up for Obamacare.  Signing up.  Right.  Um, yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Um, yeah, yesterday was the deadline for signing up.  Uh, my insurance expires in May.  I found this out through phone calls.  And by the way, when, when the Obamacare fucking deadline day is there, and of course this is 
[00:26:00]  partly my fault for waiting last minute, but I really wasn't sure until yesterday when  I started hearing things and going, oh my God, am I in short?  Uh, boy, are those phone lines, uh, tied up for hours.  Right.  I'm on hold.  I finally get through.  I'm asking, am I covered?  Uh, well, you're covered until the policy is canceled because it doesn't, um, adhere to the rules of, of the Obamacare shit.  Can't they just, uh, offer some add-ons to your policy to make it really easy?  No, no.  No, they have to cancel your policy, and then you have to reapply. 
[00:26:30]  No, why?  They want to catch you to get the, uh, to get the penalty.  Maybe.  Maybe that's it.  Of course that's what it is.  Because why wouldn't they just take your, your current insurance and go, okay, this is what you're missing, and we're just going to add it on.  Add it.  They want to cancel everyone's policy knowing they're going to catch people not re-signing up.  Probably.  And then what is it, a hundred dollar penalty?  I don't even know what the penalty is.  And that goes up year after year.  I, I heard after a few years it's, uh, like a $650, uh, penalty you're going to pay. 
[00:27:00]  Of course that's what it is.  They want to make money off us.  Yeah.  Because we don't have the right insurance policy.  Yeah.  So, so, I, I, I, I hear, here's, here's my situation.  Yes, they are canceling my policy because it doesn't adhere to the Obamacare bullshit of having, um, uh, children's orthodontia in there.  And, uh, pregnancy fucking shit that I'm a single guy. 
[00:27:30]  I don't need orthodontia and fucking pregnancy care.  It's, it's ridiculous and retarded.  Why are they doing that?  Because, here's the deal, they know I don't need that.  Right.  But my money is now going to go into the fucking pot to pay for the people, for the leeches and lowlife fuck dicks that are spitting out children with buck teeth.  And, and, and, and that's going to get paid for with my money and not only the rich, it's not the wealthy people.  It's anyone that is paying for fucking healthcare now that doesn't have kids, that doesn't have fucking a wife that's going to be pregnant. 
[00:28:00]  You are paying for the leeches in this country.  For the leeches.  It's unbelievable, really.  So, they're going to cancel my policy in May.  Right.  And then, they, they, uh, said, okay, we're going to send you four, um, uh, applications for new policies.  Right.  Uh, and you look those over and figure out which one you want.  I clicked on these PDFs that they sent me and opened it up and it could have been alien writing from a faraway planet. 
[00:28:30]  I had no idea what the fuck this was.  I'm not a pro at this insurance shit.  So, why don't you bring, I, I wish you brought that in.  I would love to see it.  I have it in my email.  It's, it's so confusing.  Right.  And, again, the liar, the lying fuck that is our president said, if you're happy with your policy, you can keep it. 
[00:29:00]  He said that.  Blatantly said it to sell this piece of shit legislation.  So that people wouldn't lose their fucking minds even more than they were.  Because if he said, by the way, if your policy doesn't have what I say it should have.  Right.  It's going to get canceled.  Right.  It never would have passed.  Of course.  Never.  Of course.  And he knew this and blatantly lied to the American people in a very personal way.  And people have, uh, criticized me and said, hey, all the politicians lie, man. 
[00:29:30]  All the politicians lie.  I agree.  But this is a very personal, one-on-one lie to the American people.  Where his lie doesn't trickle down to affect you.  It directly, in your face, affected you.  He lied directly to you.  George Bush Sr. lost an election by lying like that.  Saying, no new taxes.  And then he turned around and taxed people.  It was a fucking lie.  Much like Obama lied to the American people about keeping your fucking... 
[00:30:00]  Didn't Bush not raise taxes?  They kind of nailed him with that?  Yeah, they nailed him with it.  But it's his legacy.  Right.  No new taxes.  They were taxed.  It's his fault.  It's funny you bring up legacy.  This is what this is all about.  Of course.  This is Obamacare.  Of course.  It's a great legacy for him as a man, as the President of the United States of America.  Problem is, it wasn't ready to be rolled out.  But he needs it in place now so he could have his dumb legacy.  So he could reap the rewards for his legacy. 
[00:30:30]  He's not reaping the rewards.  He's not reaping the rewards on this one.  But he needs this in place now.  Yeah.  It's so obvious it needs at least another year to figure out all the bugs.  And I had a triumphant return to Twitter last night about this whole thing.  Arguing with fucking various people of various colors that just support the President based on skin color and nothing else.  Black people.  Black people.  Let me address something with you. 
[00:31:00]  Oh boy.  Obama lied about health care.  There's nothing you can say or present to me that's going to change my fucking opinion.  Because it's not an opinion.  It's a fucking fact.  The motherfucker lied about health care.  And defending him makes you look stupid.  And the fact that you defend him based on nothing but the fact that he's a black man is offensive.  It's more offensive than me dropping fucking N-bombs.  It's you defending a man based on nothing but his blackness. 
[00:31:30]  And that's exactly what's going on.  When I argue with people on Twitter, black people constantly,  Oh, fuck you.  No.  Oh, Mr. Millionaire is pissed that he's got to pay more for it.  No.  It has nothing to do with that.  I'll pay ten times more than I was paying for my health care.  I don't give a shit.  Yes.  I'm very well off.  It worked out well for me.  I'm blessed.  Thank you.  But that has nothing to do with the fact that the president fucked dick lied to the American people. 
[00:32:00]  And believe me, this isn't the only instance, but this is the one I'm bringing up because it's so blatant.  There's no excuse making.  There's no people in the way as a buffer that lie for him.  There's no excuse that he could say, well, it was this guy or that guy.  He directly went on television, looked everyone in the face, and said,  If you're happy with your health care, you can keep it.  He fucking lied.  And that was my point.  And because of that, last night, I'm there on the phone. 
[00:32:30]  I'm worried if I even have health care.  God forbid you get sick or something happens, and then you realize, oh, wait, I'm not covered.  You think the insurance company is going to say, oh, but you were trying.  You were confused about, okay, we'll pay for it.  Ha ha.  No, they won't fucking do that.  You were so upset that you slit your wrist.  Lil Beavis was adorable.  Oh.  Lil Beavis was adorable.  That's a cutter.  Last night.  Oh, you know, cutter.  You're a cutter.  He put such a gas in my fucking arm. 
[00:33:00]  Looks like you slit your wrist.  Oh, it was great.  He does this thing where he attacks me, and he rolls.  He jumps, but as he jumps, he literally turns upside down.  Right.  And then grabs you with his nails and teeth.  Yeah.  And then uses his body weight to flop over the other way so he can rip with his thing.  It's amazing.  He's trying to smother you.  You understand that.  It's crazy.  He's going to try to drag you off.  But I figured it out, and I roll my hand with him.  When he does that, he fucking turned the other way and rolled the opposite direction that 
[00:33:30]  I turned, and just ripped up my arm.  It was adorable, though.  You might get cat scratch fever now.  Dan, dan, dan.  Let me tell you.  Uncle Ted got the cat scratch fever.  A lot of phone calls.  Oh, what happened?  Opie, it's actually $100 penalty.  I think we said that.  I said $90, I guess.  Or 1% of what you make is the penalty if you don't have the proper insurance.  Whatever it is.  I'm on my new coverage, and my rate has doubled.  That has come in from John.  Oh, by the way, these are all lies. 
[00:34:00]  And, of course, it's that fucking bitch that gets on Twitter and debates with me.  And Obama could do no wrong in her eyes.  But she's just a symptom of the greater problem of just people agreeing with Obama because  they're black and he's black.  That's the fucking bottom line.  That's the bottom line.  I'm going right down the phones here, too.  I'm not trying to pick and choose, all right?  Derek on Long Island, Anthony, Obamacare is actually going to help you in the long run.  Obama lied.  I don't care.  How is it going to help us in the long run?  How does it help? 
[00:34:30]  Let's go to Derek.  Derek.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  Well, I live on Long Island.  You guys live on Long Island.  I don't live on Long Island anymore.  I do.  Apple files.  Okay, I hear you.  Here's how it's going.  I gave up on Long Island because of the stupid commute on that damn Long Island Expressway.  I would love to live on Long Island still.  You, um...  I hear you, but...  I fucking hate this city.  Enough already.  Let's just say you kind of do a little bit.  What? 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how it's going to help you, Anthony.  All right, how?  Because I'm a working guy.  I had fucking Oxford.  It went up, and of course I was angry.  I'm like, shit, my Oxford's going up.  Well, guess what?  There's a big healthcare system out on Long Island called North Shore Allied Gay, and they  came out with their own insurance, and now I pay half of what I paid before.  I got the same fucking coverage, and it's actually a good thing because now these other insurance  companies can come in.  They can cover you, and you can end up paying half. 
[00:35:30]  Yay, Obama.  Well, you know, but...  How poor are you that this is helping you?  Yeah, I...  I don't know.  I'm fucking with you.  Jesus.  I don't.  Of course.  Go hang out with the Cronut guy.  Because jokes.  No sense of humor.  No.  See, now that's going to upset Roland.  He's listening right now.  I'm sorry, Roland.  Took a weird shot at your guy, even though I love him.  Just fucking, uh...  Let's, uh...  And then we move on to PJ.  I'm disgusted with this.  If your insurance is too good, you're going to get penalized. 
[00:36:00]  I think we sort of know that.  Of course.  You know, they have like the Cadillac of insurance penalty that they have.  They don't want you to have the greatest insurance.  Because, you know what?  Everyone should just have the same everything.  Because America, the land of what they call opportunity, the pursuit of life, liberty, and  happiness, uh, is now a guarantee.  Somehow it became a guarantee.  And if you don't have the ambition or even luck that something happened to bring you up,  we're supposed to drop everything, lower everyone else's standards, uh, to a new low, 
[00:36:30]  and that's the new normal.  It's counterproductive, and this country is showing.  It's showing the wear, tear, and fucking, uh, uh, uh, the, the anchors that are around  everybody's neck, um, and, and the, the progress that we're, we're trying to make  is just being smothered.  At the very least, you should have waited to roll this thing out.  It's fucked.  You should have waited.  It's fucked.  It still has a lot of issues. 
[00:37:00]  Why can't you keep your, the stuff that you like, if you had insurance you like?  Because you, you, you need to have things that are in the plan.  And, and, and the law says you need things like, uh, pregnancy care and orthodontia for  children.  But let's go back to our original point.  Uh-huh.  Just add that on to the, the insurance you already have and like.  Well, we can't, we can't do that.  Wouldn't that be the easiest way to do this, though?  Oh, no, can't do that.  I mean, I don't even know whose fault that is.  Whether it's the insurance company's fault, the legislation, or what have you. 
[00:37:30]  Um, but it's, it's really a fucking pain in the ass.  That, that wasn't necessary.  I was fine with it.  And again, that lion sack of shit told everybody that you could keep it if you were happy with  it.  And it was a fucking, fucking lie.  And he knew it at the time.  It's his fucking legislation.  He fucking knew that you weren't going to be able to keep it even if you were happy.  I gotta tell you, this is amazing.  I can't wait for you to say April Fool's. 
[00:38:00]  This is the, this is our best one yet.  April Fool's, I'm a Democrat and I'm a fucking liberal.  I love it.  This is our best one yet.  Obama, four more years, please.  Yeah.  Your boy.  Yeah.  Mikey in New Orleans.  Mike.  Yeah, my mom and her husband are actually considering getting divorced because his insurance was  canceled.  And in order for him to afford what they offer now, he needs to be single because of their  income levels.  He has to pay an exorbitant amount. 
[00:38:30]  Uh-huh.  So they're considering getting divorced.  A lot of people.  Is this real, right?  Yeah, yeah.  People are considering things like that.  That's pretty extreme.  Right, right.  I'm not going to be honest.  I'm not going to just say, yeah, everybody's trying to get divorced now.  Right.  Because, but, but, uh, I think jobs are being affected.  I think, uh, employers aren't hiring, uh, a certain number of people due to the healthcare  problem.  Um, this Obamacare bullshit.  And, um.  There'll be more temps to hire.  Yeah, yeah.  You won't be full-time.  They'll do anything they can to hire people and not have to.  I was a temp to hire because back in the day. 
[00:39:00]  Yep.  They didn't want to pay the health insurance.  Of course not.  So they did this whole temp to hire thing.  I had a full-time job with Xerox.  Yep.  In Rochester, New York, when I was getting my radio career off the ground.  Yeah.  And I had no health insurance because they didn't want to pay for the health insurance.  And I kept going to the people, like, I've been here a year.  Like, this temp to hire, when does it become official?  Like, oh, it's never going to be official.  And I'm like, then why are you guys calling it temp to hire?  And how they get around it back, I'm trying to remember because this is vague memories 
[00:39:30]  at this point.  I think they had to hire a certain percent to make it legal or something.  Uh-huh.  This whole temp to hire program.  I think they had to hire whatever the percentage would be.  But it was such a low number.  Yeah.  And then they had everybody else as, you know, employees that they didn't have to give  health insurance to.  And that shit is going to happen more, of course.  If you're an employer, why wouldn't you do that?  And they're fucking with the numbers, too, because they're saying that six million people,  the whole fucking White House bullshit line they're throwing out, is that six million 
[00:40:00]  people have signed up so far for health care.  They didn't mention the fact that over six million people lost their fucking insurance.  So when you do the numbers, it's a negative.  And then they're trying to say nine million people signed up, but they're adding on the  people that are signing up for Medicaid.  They're throwing them into the numbers to try to boost them.  This is a fucking utter failure.  Let me go to John in Georgia.  He's going to explain why you can't just add the missing parts onto your current insurance. 
[00:40:30]  Let's go ahead, John.  Yeah, hey, Opa, what they did is, you used to be able to rate somebody between a scale  of like one to ten, one being the healthiest, ten being the most unhealthy.  And Obamacare changed that, so you can only rate it like a one to a three.  So that means that they have to redo all the plans and charge everybody a whole bunch more  because, you know, the guy that smokes, the guy that's 500 pounds, he can only be a three.  He can't be a ten. 
[00:41:00]  Right, pre-existing conditions now, they can't deny you because of pre-existing conditions.  But is smoking considered a pre-existing condition?  Well, I'm sure the insurance company doesn't like that.  Oh, okay, that kind of makes sense.  It's not just the add-ons.  There's a bunch of other shit that goes into this legislation that affects your insurance policy.  So they just scrap the whole thing, start new, and like I said, I got four options that they sent me, PDF files.  I opened each one up, and I don't, it annoyed the shit out of me that I have to deal with that. 
[00:41:30]  And it sounds like, oh, I have to deal, I'm just saying, I never was supposed to have to deal with this  because I was fucking fine and happy.  I had the same insurance plan for years and years and years, and everything was dandy with it.  And he was telling all the American people, you'd be able to keep it if you were happy with it.  And he fucking lied.  And we have to pay for our own insurance, too.  Yeah, yeah, we pay.  Yeah, our employer doesn't pay for some insurance. 
[00:42:00]  You're not fining any employers anymore that fucking, you want to see a bunch of people being hired as subcontractors in everyday jobs?  Right.  Like, we're technically subcontractors here.  Right.  We don't work for Sirius.  Our company works for Sirius.  It's some kind of deal like that.  It's a workaround to save fucking money.  It's not, you know, we're not under their employ.  But we are.  But we kind of are.  Yeah, they rent us out.  When it's to their advantage, we are.  That's the problem with this shit.  But you're going to see a lot of other people doing the same thing, where a company goes, hey, you got the job, but you're not really employed by us. 
[00:42:30]  We're going to hire you as a subcontractor, which means you have to get your own pension plan.  You have to get your own insurance policy, all that shit, because we don't want to deal with it.  Now, who makes out on this?  The fucking assholes that Obama is catering to and the Democrats cater to.  The lowest, bottom-of-the-barrel motherfuckers that, by the way, were getting free health care anyway because they'd go to the emergency room, get treated, and then leave and not pay anyway. 
[00:43:00]  That's who's fucking getting it.  And by the way, out of those people that are signing up for Obamacare, they don't even know if anyone's paid a premium yet.  You think those people that, even if they're subsidized and have to pay, let's say, $5 a month, you think they're going to pay $5 a month?  They don't even pay electric bills.  They're not going to pay shit.  And then those policies are going to get canceled.  They pay for the satellite dishes, though.  Right.  You got it.  They love the satellite dishes. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, shit, motherfucker.  You gots to pay for that.  Let me go to Jeremy in Washington.  Jeremy.  Hi.  Good morning, boy.  Good morning.  Hey, Robbie in Washington.  Right.  I know.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, anyways, my son was born last year.  Oh, congrats.  And he was 13 weeks premature.  He had a lot of problems.  Just, you know, a bunch of shit going down with him where, you know, he had problems breathing and he couldn't swallow. 
[00:44:00]  He had to have a feeding tube directly into his stomach.  Yikes.  Wow.  So, anyways, this, yeah, and my insurance covered it, you know, no problem, no problem, all last year.  This year, I started getting letters from the hospital saying my insurance wouldn't cover his trips into the hospital because, you know, let's say it gets infected around his site. 
[00:44:30]  And he has to be put back into the hospital.  I mean, it's a pole going directly into his stomach that's getting infected.  Yeah.  The insurance company under Obamacare doesn't cover this because they say they don't cover skin irritations.  But it's a little more than, oh, boy.  Whatever.  I hate insurance companies to begin with.  They're the worst.  Let's start there.  Yeah.  They want you to pay in and then they'll figure out every excuse why they're not going to pay you back. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, why they're not going to honor it.  That's why when it was working for me, like if I had to go to the doctor or what have you, it worked.  I went, I gave him my card, I paid my co-pay, whatever it was, my low deductible, everything worked.  So I was happy with it.  And when you are happy with an insurance policy, it's kind of a rare thing, you know, and you want to keep it.  And lied to. 
[00:45:30]  Overwhelmingly negative phone calls about Obamacare.  But I think we got one here.  Let's try this one.  Charles in New Mexico.  Charles.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Charles.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  So my one-year-old, through Obamacare, is now required to have a gym membership.  Oh, required.  Oh, come on.  Is that true?  It said that you got a free gym membership because of Obamacare.  Oh, no, no, no.  And it's required.  I have to pay for it.  She's one years old.  What the fuck is she going to do at a gym? 
[00:46:00]  Adorable.  Practice your jumping jacks.  Oh.  Uncle Paul.  This doesn't seem to be the norm, though.  Who's norm?  This can't be the norm that you have to throw your one-year-old into.  I know.  I can start weightlifting.  Swinging kettlebells.  We have to have the pregnancy care, all that bullshit for one-year-old.  I mean, come on.  Seriously?  Well, how come they don't do this?  Why don't...  Like, not that obesity is the biggest cost in the country, but why don't they have a thing  where you have to weigh a certain amount, a reasonable amount of weight, or you're not 
[00:46:30]  covered?  I can hear you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's feeding back.  Thank you, Charles.  No, it's feeding back.  We've got to let you go.  Because, again, this health care plan, legislation, says that any pre-existing condition, you can't  be denied for insurance.  So, no matter how obese you are, no matter how poorly you're taking care of yourself, you  have to be covered.  You have X amount of time.  How about this?  You're covered.  But you have...  And they give you X amount of time to remedy the problem. 
[00:47:00]  Like, you'll be covered while you're remedying it.  Honestly think something like that would fucking get passed in this day and age where there'd  be fatties protesting.  Hey, smokers too.  And I'm one of you, an ex-smoker.  I get it.  But if you smoke, you have X amount of time to quit, or none of your smoking-related health  problems...  Do you realize the percentage of obesity in the black community?  They would turn around and say that it's racist to try to deny health care to black 
[00:47:30]  people based on obesity because of the number of obese black, especially women.  But I think that if you do it with obesity, it's across the board, and smoking, and things  like that are fixable, and you give people a really fair amount of time to start down the  road of getting better.  Plenty of time, you know, you don't ask them to do it in six months.  We never wash.  They would say it's some type of discrimination.  Yeah.  It's abominable.  It's abominable what's happening.  Fucking disgusting.  But I wouldn't mind paying for that.  I wouldn't mind paying for people and helping them. 
[00:48:00]  If people are actually putting the time and effort into, like, losing the weight, I have  no problem paying.  It's another freebie that's being thrown out to the Democratic constituency so they  could fucking pull that voting handle for Democrats.  It's the same thing they're doing with immigration.  It's the same thing.  They gather up with the voter rights bullshit that they're against having an ID to vote because  it's too strenuous for black people and Mexicans to go to a motor vehicle and get a license 
[00:48:30]  or an ID.  How fucking crazy is that shit?  And I can't...  I gotta jump through loops to exercise my Second Amendment right.  Fuck yous all.  I'm so sick of this godfuck country.  Yo.  I'm sick of it.  This place stinks.  Yo.  You're opening your pool today.  I need to relax in the jacuzzi with a bottle of wine. 
[00:49:00]  Tired of it.  Come to my pool.  You don't have a pool.  Apple Falls.  Apple Falls.  All right, then.  Fuck, it's only 725.  It's a long day.  We could go back to this.  The phone's just lit.  Oh, yeah.  But we have to talk about some other things next.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  It's a fun-filled day.  We've got some other things to talk about today.  Ah.  Boy.  Oh, by the way, sorry.  Some guy said if you smoke or have a higher BMI, the body mass index, you have to pay a 
[00:49:30]  higher premium.  Okay.  Oh, yeah?  That's fair.  Do you?  Yeah.  There's something in place.  My insurance does charge more.  This is another tweet.  For obesity, high BMI, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol.  Okay.  Classes can be taken to reduce it.  All right.  It's reasonable.  We've got Amy Schumer coming in today.  But like I said, but first of all, let me just address what Jimmy said.  Yeah.  That doesn't apply if you're being subsidized, if you're one of the low-income people that  are being subsidized. 
[00:50:00]  And if you notice, those are amongst the most obese motherfuckers you're going to see on the  planet.  Right.  So, again, they're not going to pay higher premiums.  They're not paying shit.  Again, you're paying for that fat fuck to have insurance and not take care of themselves.  You're paying for all of their fucking little, little, little fucking crumb stealers' braces.  You're paying for her pregnancy care.  This is insanity.  I wouldn't mind that if we didn't waste so much money.  I do.  Stop giving money to foreign countries.  I really wouldn't mind if that money is given away. 
[00:50:30]  I know.  It's another issue, though.  It's another issue.  And just put into this country.  I agree.  I agree with Jimmy on that.  But you've got to look at these separately at this point.  You should watch Vice talking about Afghanistan and how much money we're wasting trying to  rebuild Afghanistan.  Yeah.  It'll drive you insane, Jim Norton.  And again, this guy's right.  The subsidized plans aren't sustainable.  People, young people, they need young people to sign up for this Obamacare and pay into  the premiums to pay off the subsidized people.  And they're just not signing up. 
[00:51:00]  A lot of people are signing up for subsidized care.  And the people that are supposed to pay for that, again, it's a pyramid system where the  money's not coming in and it'll just collapse after a while.  This is one of the worst fucking plans that have ever been passed by a president.  I can't tell if you're smart or racist.  A little of both.  A little of both.  Would be the answer?  A little of one, a lot of the other.  Yeah.  Pick which one you think.  And we all know you are fairly dumb. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Amy Schumer today.  Very cool.  We haven't seen Amy in a while.  Our show premieres tonight on Comedy Central.  It's getting great reviews.  Season two, Inside Amy Schumer on Comedy Central tonight at 10.30.  Brilliant and sexy.  Yeah.  Very cool.  10.30 on the East Coast.  You figure out the times in your area.  Where we are, yeah.  Yeah, you do the math.  You do the math.  Exactly.  We're busy.  Lots of stuff to talk about today, so we better step aside.  We'll get an update on Roland, too.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's our update for? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, boy.  People are interested.  People want to know.  All right.  We got another old clip to play today.  Did you hear the old clip?  Not yet.  Okay.  Then we got to talk about Nick Cannon being an idiot.  And maybe talk about cupcakes as well.  Why are you laughing?  I thought we were done with pastries.  No, we love talking about pastries.  I do love a good pastries.  Jimmy had me laughing.  Some times. 
[00:52:30]  Appropriate times?  Yeah.  Well, we'll explain it.  Drink it up, get up.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up.  Drink up.  Drink up the Obama cool way.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say. 
[00:53:00]  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  Wouldn't you rather have  A guy holding a gun on you?  Or a guy that's about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know.  Because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Right now.  Right now.  We're having a gun held on us right now.  Stop it.  Once you vote white, you know you vote right.  Right.  Like, what?  Can I wear one of those out 
[00:53:30]  And not be beaten to a pole?  It's time for Whitey to realize  We don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say.  Let me know.  How long do we pay?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold. 
[00:54:00]  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay?  How long do we pay?  Before people fucking act like human fucking beings.  I'm in chains.  I'm in chains.  My freedom of speech is in chains.  I'm the one in chains now.  I'm in chains.  Because I can't say what I want to say. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, let me know.  How long do we pay?  I'm fucking exhausted.  I'm going to need a nap.  Might as well jump.  I noticed it's always either Van Halen, U2.  Well, who else?  Let me think.  Well, there's a lot of Van Halen news.  Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam.  We're hitting jump. 
[00:55:00]  David Lee Roth left Van Halen 29 years ago today.  What?  29 years ago?  Yep.  Smokey Robinson sings for Van Halen.  Apple falls.  Apple falls.  He doesn't care.  You don't think Edgar cares.  I don't think Edgar cares.  Yes, he just plows through it anyway. 
[00:55:30]  I was hoping to derail him, but.  Did you see the Don Valer clip yet?  I know Travis has.  He was catching the ball or throwing it out?  No, he was just catching.  Don Valer.  Trevor, a baseball legend.  Uh-huh.  How old is Don Valer is a good question.  How many is he?  What?  He's older than that, Trav.  64.  64.  Don Valer is 64.  So, he's catching the first pitch.  Opening day yesterday.  And he bends down, I guess, to kind of make the catch or pick up the ball, Travis? 
[00:56:00]  He kind of, well, you know, he was.  Drop the ball, maybe?  He was in the catcher's position.  Uh-huh.  And, Sam, if you go to Deadspin, they've got, like, the high quality.  Oh, the high quality.  That starts before that.  Yeah, thank you.  What, uh...  I've got to see the whole video.  I'm only seeing the quick clips so far.  I haven't seen this yet.  Go to Deadspin.  They have it today.  Of course they do.  Vladimir Guerrero threw out the first pitch.  Yeah, Vladimir.  Vladimir.  Well, very good.  I threw a pitch for you.  You catch.  And then it's just, like, you know, move to catch it.  Right.  Oh, he moved a little bit. 
[00:56:30]  Watch this.  Oh, boy.  Watch this.  He looks very calm.  Oh, you can't.  It's radio.  Sorry.  On one knee.  And Don Baylor injures himself.  Oh, Christ.  He can't stand up.  Well, he put his...  I heard he broke his femur.  What is...  They're saying his ankle.  He was kneeling.  And his...  He has nothing in that leg.  That motherfucker is tough.  Get a stretcher out there for the guy.  Dude, this guy's standing trying to walk on that busted leg. 
[00:57:00]  What a tough guy.  Where did he break?  Because I heard it was a femur.  He broke the femur.  That was what they thought.  Oh, they thought it was his ankle.  Yeah, he broke the femur.  You can't imagine it's a femur.  He's had a surgery.  And Brian Regan talks about that's the worst pain you could...  Oh.  ...have on your body is a broken femur.  He should have thrown out the first Boniva into his mouth.  Jesus Christ.  That tough motherfucker stood up and tried to walk.  Right.  It said, screw this.  I'm going to walk this off.  I'll walk it off.  His leg jellyfist.  I think it's a charley horse.  Right.  What a tough guy. 
[00:57:30]  Holy shit.  How old is he?  64.  64.  64.  Get the fuck off the goddamn plate.  It's just a quick...  It's just a quick ceremony thing.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's not like he's in the wind-up.  It doesn't matter.  He was just trying to be alive and viral.  Stop it.  I mean.  He was just bending down.  Yeah, exactly.  Just catching a ball.  All right.  Maybe I was a little...  Do we have the de Blasio thing, too?  The bluesy, though.  De Blasio throws out the first pitch for the Mets.  Yeah.  And, well, they don't like de Blasio already. 
[00:58:00]  It's kind of nice to see.  Yeah.  He's hateable.  He is hateable.  It's kind of nice to see.  Apparently, you did a good job, huh?  Of course.  Ah, boy.  Is that what they give you?  It's from one family.  He did a good job. 
[00:58:30]  That's a wimpy throw.  He got it to the plate and got it right there.  It was a wimpy throw.  Yeah, but his form was horrendous.  Yeah, but he was in front of the mound.  You know what?  I've just seen some real disasters, and at least he hit the fucking catcher.  Yeah, but that was a lame-ass throw.  Catcher to break his leg.  And they booed the hell out of him.  That was loud.  That's a loud boo.  I heard John Montone mention Agbayani yesterday for some reason.  Yeah.  And I just thought of how Kiner used to say it.  Oh, God.  Agbayani.  Benny Agbayani. 
[00:59:00]  Benny Agbayani.  Benny Agbayani.  No more Ralph Kiner.  That sucks.  Kiner's corner.  That one high and wide for ball two.  Pause for these words from Budweiser, the king.  De Blasio getting booed or something there.  De Blasio.  Ah, De Blasio.  Something like that.  De Boozio.  Oh, I know what I was going to say.  The Mets game.  You see all the empty seats.  It was chilly yesterday, man. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, but it's opening day.  Baseball people don't like the fucking cold.  That's for sure.  Especially for the Mets opening day.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  That was his excuse, by the way.  Huh?  That was his excuse, by the way.  What was it?  He said that his supporters were probably just too cold to clap.  A little too chilly.  Oh, that's hilarious.  He's kind of spitting it.  How cute.  My favorite.  The city hates him.  They hate him.  Yeah.  You're not fucking liked.  They hate you.  You're pre-K bullshit.  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up.  Stay in home and play golf with the Mets.  You remember that? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  One of my favorite last show was after they got knocked out of the fucking.  They knock out.  Yeah, they got knocked out of the playoff.  Stay in home.  Play golf with the Mets.  Play golf with the Mets.  And I got excited.  I thought we were going to just sing this song together.  I didn't know where you were going.  Oh, that made me laugh.  Can we play all our baseball clips today in honor of opening day?  Oh, shit.  All the classics that we love.  I want the one about the tomatoes, too.  Oh.  Who's that?  The one?  Oh, we were.  Yeah, if she would get a dick in her. 
[01:00:30]  A dick in her every once in a while.  Well, maybe she wouldn't give a shit about what the fuck is growing in her goddamn garch.  Yeah, we'll play all our baseball clips today in honor of opening day.  Sam, is there a Roland update?  Oh, boy.  We started off the show talking to Roland because he canceled the Cronut guy.  Yeah.  But in all fairness, the Cronut guy's wife was a little uncomfortable,  and Roland kind of decided it would be best to just cancel the guy. 
[01:01:00]  Do we have an update?  No, Roland, he's doing all right.  Oh, yeah.  That's your update?  He's reached out.  Yeah.  To the Cronut guy.  Cronut guy?  And what happened?  He said everything's cool.  Is everything cool with the Cronut guy?  Everything's copacetic.  Oh, okay.  So we're not on bad terms with the Cronut guy?  No.  Okay.  Thank God.  That's all you got?  I think so.  Why?  I don't know.  Anything else?  Anything else?  Any speckle of news about this situation would be greatly appreciated. 
[01:01:30]  Anything else?  Nothing I can think of.  Why do you ask?  No?  No.  Why?  What's Roland doing back there?  Just, uh...  Is he, uh, I don't know, maybe, uh, tweeting or something?  Is he tweeting?  No, there's a...  I saw...  I don't know why he...  Oh, boy.  Somebody started a fake Roland account.  What?  It's, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Never mind, then.  Oh, is it a fake Roland account? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's his same account, but with a zero instead of an O.  Oh!  Okay, now it makes sense.  Whew!  And the tweet says, settle down, Dominique.  At Jim Norton was not talking about you when he said he was going to put his dick in your  show notes.  I thought Roland actually tweeted.  Oh, that wasn't Roland.  Did Roland make a fake Roland account?  I don't think he did.  Oh, okay.  That's making sure.  Holy shit.  That was like the Cuban Missile Crisis just missed.  Okay, all right.  I thought it was a real tweet. 
[01:02:30]  Wow, we're going to have some fireworks today.  That's going to be bad.  All right.  No, he's...  Roland's got to know we love the Cronut guy.  Of course.  We're team Cronut guy.  Team Cronut.  He's helping himself to a pastry or something just to make himself feel better.  A little comfort food, is that what they call it?  What do you mean, pastry?  What kind of pastry are we going to do today?  Probably a muffin.  Oh.  A little breakfast muffin.  Just the top of the muffin?  And he thought...  To you!  He thought we were serious about what we really wanted for today, the Entenmann's and the  Oreos and stuff. 
[01:03:00]  One of the fun things about Roland that I'm aware of, that I think you guys should be aware  of, is that he is...  No, it is.  He has a very difficult time when you're talking about his stuff.  Oh, yeah, I know.  We all do.  You're not taking everything 100% seriously.  Uh-huh.  Ah, okay.  So that was...  I didn't take it seriously!  Right.  Hmm.  I got a...  It's stressful being Roland.  It's very stressful being Roland. 
[01:03:30]  It's very stressful being Roland.  Well, you know, like I said, what I'm annoyed at is that we...  And I don't give a fuck if he's angry at me.  I don't care.  Apparently so.  Because I love the guy, but it was like, you should have called and just said, hey, guys,  this is how...  Is everything cool?  I'm asking you as a...  Like, what were we going to say?  Like, you know, like, I'm not going to lie to you.  Of course, everything would have been fine.  I was like, all right.  Yeah, we'd treat the guy great when he comes in.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we would.  That's like a thing.  But, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's just that there wasn't a call for us.  Like, if he had written this and no one answered him back, and then he goes, look, it's probably  better.  I don't.  Mm-hmm.  Okay. 
[01:04:00]  But he didn't even try.  No.  Mm.  What the fuck?  Ah, what the Christ.  But I'm sure it'd be a good interview.  What the Christ.  You should do the interview.  It'd be a good one.  So, what do you do?  Do you bake?  Oh, no.  So, how do you get the hole in that thing?  What?  Where'd the idea come from?  Where'd the holidays?  Everybody must love you.  It's flaky and cakey.  I don't get it.  How'd you do that? 
[01:04:30]  All right.  I love this commercial.  Hick snake.  Yeah, I caught that.  Before we move on from sports, did you guys see that someone stole the Stanley Cup?  Who?  What?  Oh, no.  You thought radio could get douchey.  You haven't seen this campaign yet?  Where'd I take it from?  It wasn't Edgar.  Did he do it?  No.  My friend Stanley took it back. 
[01:05:00]  Did he?  Apple files.  Just stop it.  I don't know what the NHL is.  Please, April 2nd, get here quickly.  Why?  I didn't get a stop.  I know.  That's true.  I don't know why the NHL is doing this.  Is this their big April Fool's prank?  No.  Are they doing like a fucking fugitive?  What?  Yes.  No way.  Yes.  What?  This is so uncomfortably bad.  Oh, you're the fugitive.  Oh, wait. 
[01:05:30]  No, a dog came up to me.  I mean, a dog came up to me.  They're doing the fugitive bit with the Stanley Cup?  Yes.  The Stanley Cup has been stolen.  The Stanley Cup has been stolen.  The Stanley Cup.  The trophy given to the National Hockey League champions has been stolen.  Witnesses described three men in their mid-30s leaving a local ice rink with something suspiciously  large underneath their jacket.  They say the three men are not armed nor remotely dangerous. 
[01:06:00]  Police have issued a sketch of one suspect thought to be the ringleader.  This is a major blow to hockey and hockey fans everywhere.  Whoever took board Stanley's Cup is stealing not just a trophy but a dream.  A dream of players and supporters around the world.  I'm angry.  I'm very angry.  We need to find it.  That's ridiculous.  You can't steal the Stanley Cup.  Let's get something straight.  The Stanley Cup is sacred.  The trophy, of course, considered priceless.  The trophy takes its name from Lord Stanley, the 16th Earl of Derby, and is considered  priceless. 
[01:06:30]  Somebody comes in and just steals it?  It's unbelievable.  34 pounds of silver missing?  Commodity traders must be jumping out of windows right now.  The trophy has previously been lost.  Dumped into a canal.  I like that wide-eyed bitch.  And once a player's child was even crisped in it.  The unique way in which the Cup has passed around the winning team and travels the country  has long made it a target for thieves everywhere.  You can run, but you cannot hide.  The Stanley Cup will be brought back to the National Honor League, guaranteed.  We wait in hope for the safe return of sport's most iconic trophy. 
[01:07:00]  Who stole Stanley?  Hashtag Cupnappers.  You know that girl, that blonde with the wide-set eyes?  I think it's kind of cute.  She followed me on Twitter for like a day.  Oh, you blew it.  I think she'd had it with my...  Oh, you blew it.  She probably went, how could she not?  She probably has at least one black friend.  And she's probably like, who is this monster?  Oh, you fucking blew it.  I did.  They gotta get the fucking Cup back.  Oh, Chip, are you concerned? 
[01:07:30]  Of course she is.  34 pounds of silver.  So where is this gonna go?  How is this gonna develop?  Yeah, what is this?  What's this bit?  So stupid is what it is.  But what are they...  Then what happens?  Yeah, what happens?  You hashtag Cupnappers, and then what?  If you find the Stanley Cup...  Should we hijack Cupnappers today?  Oh, come on.  Cupnappers, yeah.  They stole it out of the locker room  so all the guys were getting hit in the ditch with baseballs. 
[01:08:00]  How about we hijack Cupnappers today?  Cupnappers.  Is that their hashtag?  Yeah, hashtag Cupnappers.  C-U-P, obviously.  N-A-P-P-E-R-S.  Cupnappers.  You said P-P.  What are they doing?  Like...  What are they...  What...  Travis?  What's the endgame here?  Does anyone know the endgame?  I think it's just promo.  But it's horrible promo.  It's homo.  Yeah, it's...  So...  But there's got to be something like all this...  It's not just going to turn up. 
[01:08:30]  They're not just going to drop it here.  There's got to be something like...  Clues?  Maybe it'll turn into a Snickers commercial or something.  Hey, watch your language.  Why don't we just steal it for real next time we see it?  That guy always brings it around.  Why don't we just steal it for real?  That would be kind of cool.  Why not?  You think that guy would be able to stop you?  And then I'll go,  Hey, man, you did the Cupnappers thing.  I was just going with the bit.  Having a little fun with it.  Melt it down.  Sell it to Bill Devane.  Right.  That's right.  He likes precious metals.  Oh, boy.  It's already started. 
[01:09:00]  Is it?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  More reasons to not give a shit about hashtag hockey, hashtag Cupnappers, hashtag desperate  for fans, hashtag O.B. Anthony.  I'm not desperate for fans.  That's son of a...  Oh, the NHL.  Ah, the NHL.  But see how that reads.  It looks like we're desperate for fans.  Oh, boy.  Well, that's just dumb.  I love when the Stanley Cup guys come in and talk about the engraving.  Lord Stanley?  Talk about how the cup was just the top part until they... 
[01:09:30]  What?  Oh, the white gloves.  Oh, the white gloves.  Yeah.  Take a picture with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  It's a flying fuckaroonie.  Who took a shit in it?  Does anyone explain this?  Well, we don't like talking about that.  Oh, really?  The sacred cup.  Right.  Who cares?  Yeah, someone took a dump in it.  Yeah, apparently.  Or peed in it or something.  They took it and drank out of it all night long.  Ho, ho, ho.  Crazy.  Who cares?  Did it end up at the bottom of a pool or something? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, look out.  They told us all the stories.  The wacky stories that that Stanley Cup has gone to.  Wow.  Amazing.  I like to eat potato salad out of it.  Or just do something really lame.  Yeah.  Something really stupid.  Eat coleslaw.  Oh.  Put dates in it and then eat the dates.  Eat dates.  Make it a giant Klegsmar.  You're dumb Klegsmar.  No, it's when you crunch up the snow peas and you make a paste.  Uh-huh.  And you lie in the inside of the Stanley Cup with them.  Oh, that sounds good.  And you fill it with whipped cream and rotted oranges. 
[01:10:30]  Oh.  That's a Klegsmar.  See, the rotted oranges.  And gefilte fish.  Oh, okay.  If you made it to a movie theater this weekend, chances are you might have noticed that a theatrical plug for the Stanley Cup playoff snuck into your regular diet of movie trailers.  It looked a lot better than draft day.  Welcome to the NHL's playoff marketing campaign for 2014.  Sounds great.  Sounds great.  In this year's ads to drum up interest for the Stanley Cup.  Exactly. 
[01:11:00]  Borefest.  It all leads to the social media tie-in with the hashtag Cup Nappers, asking who stole the cup.  Presumably because this description isn't very helpful unless Jason Voorhees is back for another go.  What?  I don't know.  It's the Friday the 13th killer.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't have anything to do with Cup Nappers.  It's because the...  I skipped ahead on the article.  I just couldn't read the whole thing.  The drawing?  The hockey mask.  Oh, is that supposed to be a hockey mask?  Well, they're wearing hockey masks in the video.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[01:11:30]  No, it could be.  There's a leprechaun.  I wanted to go.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  I got brutal.  That's just...  Lord, it's a fire.  That's just stupid.  It is stupid.  It is very stupid.  That's worse than beach tips.  Ooh.  Well, slow.  From Opie and Anthony.  Slow down.  That's worse than beach tips.  I'm sorry.  It is.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Talking, hanging.  Catch some rays.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  And stealing the Stanley Cup.  That's what I want to do. 
[01:12:00]  Eating some cupcakes?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Hmm.  Oh.  Subject number.  I just can't.  Oh.  You got him.  I just can't.  I was laughing so hard yesterday.  I don't get mad anymore.  I just laugh.  We've each had our diatribe so far, except now Opie's turn.  Well, we're doing an Unmasked with Ron Bennington.  What?  On Thursday, April 17th, at Caroline's on Broadway in New York City.  We don't want to do it at Caroline's. 
[01:12:30]  Why not?  We want to go to a bigger venue, but.  We like Caroline's.  But.  Caroline's is amazing.  I love Caroline's.  My only issue with it is that there's an out time.  Yeah.  We want to hang out.  It's a great club.  We want to hang out with the fans.  Great Charles and the gang knows we love Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  We just want a better situation.  But then.  Better situation.  We have some time.  But then basically Don said, look, you know, trust me, it'll be great, blah, blah, blah.  We're building toward a bigger event.  I hate the term building for a.  It's the dumbest thing to say in the corporate world. 
[01:13:00]  It never makes it to the built part.  No.  But what does that mean?  If we could do a big event now and a big event later this year, then that's it.  It doesn't have to.  What's what is building?  Here's what that means.  And this is not Don's fault, but they probably will give him no money to work with.  So he's he's trying to make this work on a shoestring budget.  And like Caroline's, he can probably get cheap.  And he doesn't want to come out and just say, hey, look, the company's not going to give you guys a dollar.  So he's just trying.  I absolutely agree with Jim Norton.  This has nothing to do with Don Wicklin.  Dandy Don Wicklin. 
[01:13:30]  Damn nice eyes.  And or Tim Sabian.  They're doing the best with what they, you know, been handed.  Yes.  By God, we mean.  And then I heard the press release.  There's a press release where we had quotes.  I thought our quotes were humorous.  And do you have the press release?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I don't I don't know this part of it yet.  I heard rumors about it.  Opie and Anthony celebrate 20 years. 
[01:14:00]  But this is a what's the what's the what's the this is an unmasked.  It's not really a celebration of 20 years interview.  It's an interview.  Yeah, we're let's not we're in our 20th year together and we're just doing some things on the channel.  We would do something a lot bigger than this if we were doing a 20th year.  Well, that's building part of the event.  Oh, that's the building.  Don't say building.  I got you.  Building towards.  You have to know what that final event is.  You don't just build.  But no one builds a building not knowing how many stories.  Without the blueprint.  But someone explain to me what building towards means. 
[01:14:30]  If we have a fan base and we can do something big now, then you do something big now.  Exactly.  What are we building toward?  Now you got the press release.  I don't see it.  Oh, because I heard.  Oh, boy.  Well, I heard that our our quotes are not in the press release, but Scott Greenstein's is.  Did it go out or is it only in general?  Scott Greenstein has the only quote in the press release.  What the fuck does that guy have to do with our careers? 
[01:15:00]  Could someone explain that to me?  Let's see if it went out, though.  Maybe that was just an internal thing.  We've been doing this for 20 years, fighting and scratching and clawing our way all the  way to the top.  That guy had nothing to do with our fucking careers.  Why is he the one quoted in our press release?  Um, I don't have an answer to that.  Why the fuck is that going on?  I don't know.  Huh?  I don't know.  Where's the press release?  Sam refuses to click on it.  He's actually gotten in our way. 
[01:15:30]  Like everyone else has come before him.  Just a bunch of fucking roadblocks.  Just to be bowled over.  Holy fuck.  I got it.  I got it.  What the hell has he done for us?  I need to know right now.  He hasn't done shit for us.  Promised us all sorts of things and has lied to our face.  What?  No, I'm just saying.  This is my Obama rant. 
[01:16:00]  Let me have it.  Yeah, I hear you.  What the hell has he done?  He's done nothing.  The studio was supposed to be temporary.  That was a lie.  I looked at him and said, hey, we need more space.  All we need is this much from that other studio.  Says, no problem.  Got it.  We'll do that.  Then that was a lie.  You got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Then we'd come up with a promotion that would have cost the company absolutely nothing,  which would have been our, that would have been the amazing event for 20 years of radio  together.  Yes.  Imagine, if you will, a cruise. 
[01:16:30]  That would be nice.  We're going to do a cruise.  We're going to do.  On a cruise.  An entire cruise ship full of us, comics, bands, and you, the lucky listeners that would  have been on board.  Bennington doing an unmasked, on the boat.  Oh, a big cruise ship.  Comedians.  Holy fucking craziness that would have been.  All sorts of events we had planned.  And the problem came down to this, that the cruise line would have got too many free mentions.  Yeah, but you wouldn't have had to spend a dollar on the fucking thing. 
[01:17:00]  We figured out how to pay for it.  And then if you know how to sell it, then you make money on it that way.  Then the company could be like, oh, we'll sell airtime.  This one is sponsoring.  Right, right, right.  But apparently, I don't know how that works.  So what has he done for us?  He's done nothing for us.  A lot of empty promises.  Yeah.  They haven't spent a dollar on this show, promotionally.  Can't find the, uh, I don't see any press outlets related.  Yeah, maybe someone saw a copy of it that didn't go out yet. 
[01:17:30]  I swear to you, I am days away from saying I ain't doing this.  Oh, why?  Because it doesn't feel right.  It's going to be fun.  It doesn't feel right.  And people are not bringing me cupcakes.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that's all about.  I'm not going to sit there and have some guy that barely knows us fucking coming on stage  and interrupting the unmasked with a cupcake.  I didn't hear about this.  God damn cupcake.  What is this?  Look at you.  What is this?  I didn't hear. 
[01:18:00]  Is this like the giant Pop-Tart where we're going to broadcast next time?  There is a rumor going around, a very strong rumor, that the unmasked, which is only an  hour, by the way, we could talk for three straight hours.  We've got that many stories.  It's going to be a quick hour.  I even said, hey, man, I'd like to go more than an hour.  Sure.  Because that hour is going to go really quickly.  And then I'm hearing, there's a huge rumor that guys that have nothing to do with our  careers again are going to come walking out with cupcakes to congratulate us on 20 years 
[01:18:30]  of radio together.  Who?  Are you going to be hungry?  Like who?  I heard.  Well, first of all, I've heard a lot of celebrities, because they're reaching out to a lot of celebrities,  are not even getting back to them.  That sounds embarrassing.  I also heard that Donald Trump might be in.  Oh, God.  We've taken two phone calls from Donald Trump over the last 20 years.  Maybe they meant Junior.  And he'll probably end up being Junior, which, you know, I like.  He's a nice guy.  I can't wait to go fly fishing with him eventually.  And then Maria Menounos.  Small bait. 
[01:19:00]  I heard Maria Menounos, who just admitted she's a fan of the show.  Two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  I don't want a cupcake for Maria Menounos.  I do, metaphorically.  Oof.  Yeah, I know what that means.  It was a sex joke.  It bombed horribly.  Aprilfuls.  Do you want cupcakes from celebrities?  No.  Not at all. 
[01:19:30]  Where is this coming from?  The plane made a left turn, apparently.  Do you want...  Yeah.  Whoa.  I see what's going on there.  Oh.  Interesting.  Do you want, like, somebody to come out and hand you a cupcake?  This is a strong rumor.  I don't even know if it's true.  Sam, is this true?  I couldn't be happier.  What do you know?  I couldn't be happier that I was gone on Thursday and Friday, and I have not heard any of these plans.  Where did you hear tell of this? 
[01:20:00]  I'm no fucking Sam Roberts.  Oh, shit.  Meaning a rat.  Meaning a rat fink.  Yes.  No rat.  Homosexual.  Yes.  I've heard it from multiple people.  That's how I cover everyone's asses.  Multiple people.  That celebrities are going to come out in the middle of our interview with Ron Bennington.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden just bust up everything and say, here's a cupcake.  And the crowd is going to go, yay.  I will shove the cupcake in Donald Trump's face. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, shit.  And I like the guy, but he's not doing that.  That'll probably be good.  He's going to come out, hey, you guys have been here for 20 years.  Have a cupcake.  Oh, the company wanted me to tell you, you're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  And everyone goes, whoo, because it's his catchphrase.  You're fired.  Do you guys like cupcakes?  I don't.  They're all right.  You do.  I don't give a shit about cupcakes.  I hate cupcakes, by the way.  You do?  Yeah.  They're terrible.  They're not like cake.  What kind of person hates a cupcake? 
[01:21:00]  I like that he said, by the way.  That's his size.  Because I thought about it for a second.  It's like, cupcakes are terrible.  They're, they're, just have a piece of cake.  I love a cupcake.  They're never good, stupid frosting on top.  I hate cupcakes.  What a skill joy.  Can we have Maria, can we have Maria bring Anthony a slice of cake?  We have, we have, I like that.  And like I said, this has nothing to do with Don and Tim.  There's no promotional budget.  It's embarrassing.  Because, you know, the other guy down the fucking hall, they'll, they'll fucking throw another 
[01:21:30]  few million dollars at him.  Yeah, it's true.  Does he bring in a large audience?  Of course.  But it's, it's just ridiculous.  Well, it would also, if it's an hour interview, it might be difficult to schedule A-list celebrities  like all within one hour just to show up with a cupcake.  A-list.  Maybe the cronut guy?  Will he show or is he still mad at us?  No, apparently not.  We burned that bridge.  Yeah, burned.  And then it'd be humorous on a radio program.  Burn that cronut.  And a friend of mine has reached out to me about the cupcakes.  Oh. 
[01:22:00]  Who?  A little guy named Paul Williams.  Hey!  What?  Let's give him a call.  Oh, no, no.  I'm gonna, I gotta call him.  No, he's sleeping.  It's fucking, it's five in the morning.  You should give him a text.  It's five and a half.  He's not, he's no kid anymore.  Unless, I back this up, it's just a rumor.  Just an old-fashioned love song playing on the radio.  More.  How did they do it on the Muppets?  That was a little bit different.  Oh, shit.  An old-fashioned love song. 
[01:22:30]  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Yeah.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  And now, do-do-do-do-do.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Still don't have that phone number in your phone?  I don't know why.  I just noticed that.  The love boot.  Soon we'll be making another run.  Do-do-do.  The love boot.  You don't like that?  The love boot?  It's a stupid.  It's a crazy idea for a show.  It's not tarted.  How are you gonna wake the baby? 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Let's do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  What did it get?  Do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do.  Oh.  Do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Fucking tard.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Adrian.  Oh, no.  Hello?  Is that a real ring?  Yeah.  Believe it or not, Paul is in the tomb. 
[01:23:30]  That's how they get out of the country ring.  Leave your message at the beep.  Where could I be?  Believe it or not, I'm not home.  All right, it's Paul.  I'm gonna be out of the country until April 8th.  Jesus.  What happened?  I don't know.  Was there something?  I just dumped.  Just, just his...  No, no, no, no.  Oh!  We're good.  Oh!  We're good.  He's just blowing up everyone's spot. 
[01:24:00]  He rocks one thing.  Paul Williams is another.  Simply stay on the line.  Stay on the line simply.  I would do that.  Or press three.  Whatever you want to do.  Hey, Paul.  Hi, Paul.  Hi, Paul.  Anthony, love you, miss you.  Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  And just ignored.  Press one.  Well, I'm sorry if I need to...  Press two.  That's a great message.  I'm done singing an old-fashioned love song. 
[01:24:30]  That's good, right?  Yeah, it'll get him thinking.  By the way...  It'll get him thinking.  I don't like that nobody was impressed that I recognized the ring of being out of the country.  I was.  Thank you, Sam.  What?  Did you notice that?  No, I noticed that you noticed.  Wait, what are you kidding?  What did it do?  They go...  But I said that that means he's probably out of the country.  How do you know?  Because it wasn't the traditional ring.  I knew something was going on.  But if it's a cell phone, what does that matter? 
[01:25:00]  I guess that's what they do now.  Do you have that audio, Travis?  I'm just...  I'm a guy who recognizes phone rings.  Hello!  International roaming Jimmy.  Oh, what?  Oh, it rings different if you're international.  Ah, well...  Well, that's fun.  We didn't get to the bottom of...  I'm hearing that Mr. Paul Williams, they reached out to him to deliver us a cupcake.  How many cupcakes do you guys want?  Don't call these people and ask for this embarrassing shit.  We want 20.  I'll tell you how many they'll have.  We bought six. 
[01:25:30]  We've got four left over.  One was big A.  How embarrassing.  Roland's here.  Who's going to call Paul Williams and he's going to be like, ew, these guys are doing what?  You all right?  They're rolling.  Paul Williams, he's a big star.  Do you know anything about the cupcakes?  Unfortunately, I do.  Oh, you do?  I do.  Because at this point, I had to say it's a strong rumor.  Is this a real thing?  During the concert, Jimmy heard my soul crying.  I was sending emails asking for cupcakes. 
[01:26:00]  This is so...  See when I hear my cupcakes.  Wait, so you have to email a lot of celebrities to see if they'll come out with a cupcake to present  to me and Anthony?  I didn't say cupcake.  I said, um, it is my soul cried when I did that.  And you didn't say cupcake.  It's just a small pastry.  Yes.  I just said they're going to think of something.  I couldn't write cupcake on the email.  I just were like...  But they said cupcakes.  And did Paul...  Yeah.  And did Paul Williams get back to you?  Like, his person did.  They said they love you.  He would love to do something in a grander scale than walking... 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, no shit.  Tell him we start with a cupcake.  We're building.  But we start with a cupcake.  Well, she said, well, did they sit down?  I was like, no, no, no.  It's a quick walk.  Whoever came up with this, I hope they get Danish for Belle.  Put a nice pic into his head.  No, I understood.  I agree.  I don't disagree.  Alrighty.  Oh, Christ.  Really?  What the Christ?  Did they really think of this?  Oh, yeah.  This is stupid.  But the celebrity responses must have been good, though.  So how many got back?  Yeah.  Who do we have?  There's some I didn't... 
[01:27:00]  I mean, they wanted one person, but I was like, oh.  Who?  We're waiting on an answer from Steve the Whistler.  Gervais?  I was like, no.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Don't ask the celebrities for this shit.  How embarrassing.  Don't waste Ricky Gervais on that.  Right.  So that's why I kind of scrambled on the other ones before I start hitting that list.  But I don't understand what this would do.  It doesn't make sense.  Because we only have an hour to talk.  That's going to go by like that.  And then we got interruptions, and then every guy that comes out, because they're fucking 
[01:27:30]  egomaniacs, they're going to need a few minutes in front of everybody.  But it's not a few minutes.  It's a walk-by.  That's not what I was talking about.  No, but it's not going to...  But that's not how it works out.  You guys are going to have to talk with your mouthfuls, too.  You don't have to gimmick this up.  For the love of Christ, it's a great interview opportunity with Ronnie Bennington.  Fucking genius.  It's one cupcake.  One cupcake.  I don't give a fuck.  We all get a cupcake?  Ta-da!  From a different celeb?  Yeah.  Yes, please.  Is Donald...  Yes, Donald? 
[01:28:00]  You guys...  You guys have been making...  Have been making cupcakes out of people for a long time.  You're fired.  Oh!  Settle the crowd down now.  They're going wild.  Yeah.  This is the dumbest idea.  Who has said yes so far?  Not yet.  Just puzzled.  Yeah, exactly.  Puzzle bewilderment?  Tentative.  Yeah, like a good friend, Dick Coveney, goes,  Yeah, I'll see you guys soon, because what's this?  Oh, no.  Not David.  Do Cup Me 2? 
[01:28:30]  No yeses.  But there's been 41 no's, two ha's, and 300 no responses.  But he is talking about a new X-Files movie he's going to come talk about.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  I'd be sick to see that.  Does everybody want to name their dream cupcake celebrity?  Maybe just in terms of goal setting?  Okay.  I've brought cupcake for you.  But, you know, lucky I didn't punch it, being the bull who rages.  Ah, that's a good one, Bob. 
[01:29:00]  I think they probably got the idea from Fallon, remember, all the people of Fallon?  Hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah.  That makes more sense, though.  But that's a visual element.  That's television, yeah.  Oh, Christ almighty.  That's the Tonight Show, and they had fucking, you know, Beyonce and Lady Gaga doing it.  Yeah.  I'd rather have Magic Johnson bring it out while he's juggling razor blades.  I would actually like that a lot, too.  Yeah.  I've, uh, I don't know what to even say about this idea.  You like it.  I know what not to say, and that's it. 
[01:29:30]  Surprise.  Surprise.  Don?  Don doesn't like being on the air.  I know, but something's going on here.  Where's that from?  Washington?  Why didn't that ring?  This is stupid hacker bullshit.  Sometimes it takes a while.  Kicked him out of the room.  Oh, there it's right.  Okay.  All right.  This is not going to be good.  I'll blame Roland.  Dan D. Dunn Wicklip.  Donny Boy. 
[01:30:00]  He's looking at the phone right now like, do I do this?  Donny Baseball.  Donny Baseball.  Donny Rock and Roll.  I just can't take some further.  Donny Bagadona.  Oh, that's the voicemail ring.  That is.  Right?  Or it's overseas.  I don't know.  Jimmy?  You're the expert on the rings.  No, no, that's neither.  That's the, I'm staring at this and debating it,  and I'm just not going to do it.  Exactly.  For his own best interest.  Wow.  He's doing something.  He might be on a train. 
[01:30:30]  He might be on a choo-choo.  Who with who?  Pull me a pulling one.  Oh, Christ.  So, there you go.  Mr. Williams was correct.  Huh?  Paul Williams was correct.  I know.  He left the country so he doesn't have to answer that stupid fucking gimmick.  Cupcakes.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Book me a flight.  I'm going to Indonesia.  We have really done nothing with our careers if it comes down to having...  Guys, I brought you a cupcake.  People coming out with cupcakes, and you know they're not going to get anyone of significance. 
[01:31:00]  Those people we barely even know.  I know.  He doesn't even like cupcakes.  I hate them.  You love cupcakes.  You're stupid.  How would you react if you didn't know about it and surprised during that?  The closest thing I like to a cupcake is Yankee Doodles.  Do they even make them anymore?  Yankee Doodles?  Yeah.  I love a Yankee Doodle.  That cream-filled fucking shit.  Chocolate cake.  Fake shit.  Well, we're going to have to get some because we don't have Dominic today.  It's like the crocodile.  Dominic coming?  I don't like the chocodile, right?  The chocodile, yeah.  That was a chocolate-covered Twinkie?  Yeah, sort of. 
[01:31:30]  Is Dominic coming today?  He has a meeting right now.  So, maybe tomorrow?  Yeah, I sent an email to his wife and him.  Oh, boy.  He's just got to believe.  He's got to just believe in the power of this show.  Believe.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, just believe.  Tell him.  Don't worry about it.  Be a believer.  Holy God.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Let me go to David in Florida.  David.  David?  My David.  Go ahead, David. 
[01:32:00]  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Welcome aboard, Dave.  What's up?  Sampanin'.  Watch him.  All right.  You ripping barring hits, bro?  Did you drink beer in high school?  No, I'm not one of those guys.  That's so cool.  Yeah.  But I have to say something.  That guy.  Do you think this is the company's way of saying, uh, get out of here?  Get out of here.  I love this guy.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  I hate this guy.  I think that's where, I really believe this is where it's leading to. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  I, I, I don't, I, I'm bored here to be honest with you.  I just don't understand this place anymore.  I don't think that they, yes.  I love doing the radio show with these guys.  It has nothing to do with that.  But I'm just fucking bored.  I'd like a little boost in the repertoire.  They have zero interest in promoting us or furthering us.  I think they're okay with us being here.  I don't think they hate us.  I just think they're indifferent to us.  They're completely indifferent.  Uh, David, what else?  Do you think, uh, this is their way to say what?  Well, like I said, like, uh, like a goodbye, like a, like a, this is like kind of your versions 
[01:33:00]  of like...  Bon collion.  Huh?  This is like Howard's birthday party.  Yeah, but like, just, uh...  No, it's not.  And I hope your drink is an alcoholic drink.  Yeah, this, well, this one...  Sounds a little drunk, doesn't it?  This is not like Howard's birthday party, really.  No.  No, it's just an, it's just, it's...  Of course not, I mean...  It's an event that happens to coincide this year.  It's one of the 20th anniversary events.  I think that the 20th anniversary should be a very special thing. 
[01:33:30]  Of course it should.  The idea of an unmasked being involved is great.  But it doesn't mean we have to build towards something else.  Make it, uh, the unmasked.  People will show up.  It'll be full.  People want to go to this.  It's Ron Bennington, so it'll be a great, fun interview.  Right.  We don't have to spice it up with celebrity-delivered cupcakes.  Aches.  Holy shit-a-rony.  Thank God that, uh...  Thank God we found out about it, because this was... 
[01:34:00]  Thank God.  This was on the QT until yesterday.  Put a fucking, put the brakes on this idea, because if one more celebrity has to hear this  idea, we're not under the guise it's for us, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm embarrassed.  We're, I mean...  Yeah, because, like, Gervais is like a friend, and you're coming up to him, can you make the  boys feel nice?  Gervais is a pimp.  We...  I know it was Paul Williams all along.  We've proven over the years, too, we don't get off on celebrities, we don't need celebrity 
[01:34:30]  friends.  If they happen to be our friends and they're a celebrity, that's one thing.  But half the people at Howard's birthday party don't actually like the guy.  They knew it was a good opportunity to get some press for themselves.  Duh.  Yeah.  But that's not our thing.  We don't...  We've never done it like that.  Never.  Yeah.  God.  But this Unmasked is going to be a legendary thing that people are going to want to see.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  People can enter the sweepstakes now if they want to go be in the audience. 
[01:35:00]  David, why are you so mellow?  Right?  You're trying to actually promote the thing.  Yeah, I thought maybe we'd let people know how they could come to the show.  Bobo's been tweeting me a lot.  All right.  All right.  David, what's wrong with you?  Why the voice like that?  Yeah.  David.  Hello.  Did he hang up?  The balls haven't dropped.  What do you expect me to say?  Are you drunk?  Are you drunk, tired, high?  Sounds zoated.  Zoated.  On the oxys?  Yeah, zoated. 
[01:35:30]  What do you got going on?  You got oxys?  Oxys, Zanny.  14.  What are you doing?  Check out the empties, man.  Yeah, exactly.  What do you got going on, David?  Let us know.  How was the party last night?  Ha, ha, ha.  Dickheads on Twitter.  Hey, Ricky Gervais.  Hey, Ricky, Jim Norton wants you to give him a cupcake.  It is 10 years at the O&H show party.  That's more than 10 years, sir.  14, I think.  All right.  Well, I'll hop off.  All right.  All right, David.  You made a very good point there. 
[01:36:00]  I want you to know that Opie and Anthony 2014 on blogspot.com has a very, very happy message  for you.  Oh, wow.  That sounds mysterious.  Yeah, it is.  It's not like you're slowly dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Right.  What is the message?  I don't have one.  Goodbye. 
[01:36:30]  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right, David.  Thank you.  Thanks for the call.  That was good.  Oh.  Not for that guy.  Yeah, I know.  This is why I fucking hate everybody.  John in Ohio.  Go ahead.  Yeah, man.  The other day, I was listening to Who Who?  You Know Who.  It was a wrap-up show.  And Manu knows what's saying that when Howard goes on vacation, her and her husband just need  to be consoled and have no idea what to do and what to listen to.  See, that's why I was...  God, man. 
[01:37:00]  She can like two shows.  But she can't admit that she actually listens to us.  What she said there, because I heard about this, is when Howard's not on the air and he's  on vacation, she has nothing to listen to.  That's a blatant lie.  You don't have to go down that road.  Oh, boy.  His ass doesn't have to be lapped quite so much by some of these people.  Really, you could just...  Your life will be okay.  A little peck, a little smooch.  It doesn't have to be lapped like a thirsty dog. 
[01:37:30]  Have a little respect for yourself.  And then...  Show some pride.  Then they come in here and they say they're big fans of the show and they listen all the  time.  So what is it?  What is it, exactly?  Thank you, John.  No problem, guys.  Oh, there's been...  Instead of...  There's been a cupcake update.  Oh, there has been?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Big celebrities are going to bring...  Yeah.  Riles Rice is on stage.  Riles. 
[01:38:00]  Really?  April Falls?  Yes.  April Falls.  Yeah.  I'd love for you to April Fall off a cliff.  April Falls.  I don't get the April Falls thing.  Okay.  Good.  I'll get that call.  Up.  All right.  Well...  A lot of that I'm being thrown around today.  No!  This is just fucking...  Like I said, I don't get mad anymore.  It makes me laugh my ass off.  When I found out yesterday, I couldn't stop laughing. 
[01:38:30]  I'm like, that is the craziest thing I've ever heard.  Like people we barely know just because they're celebrities walk out and give us cupcakes.  You know how stupid that is?  Yeah.  It's an idea you pull out of your ass when you can't think of anything else.  I wish I was there when the idea was said because I'm assuming there's more to the idea than that.  Well, but Dodd won't answer his fault.  I want Oscar Pistorius to run a cupcake out to me. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Let me try this one more time.  Wow.  Yeah.  I thought that would be very funny because A, running, he's got no legs.  It wasn't, though.  No, I'm explaining my thought process.  What happened?  That failed on many fronts.  And he's on trial for a brutal murder of his brother.  He came to the U.S. and gave us cupcakes.  Oh.  Everyone's saying it's ripping off the Jimmy Fallon bit, too.  Well, yeah.  Very similar to the Jimmy Fallon money bit.  Oh, great.  Which was brilliant on his part.  Yeah.  And all those people were associated with Jimmy Fallon big time. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, no one will be on The Tonight Show.  No one is vying to get on our show.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  Well, God damn it.  We should have people who want to be on our show bringing us cupcakes.  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Olby is dangerous.  Stop the tone.  Please record your message.  Jesus Christ.  When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.  I press one.  Donnie Boy.  Donnie McClendon.  Your answering machine's on the air. 
[01:40:00]  That was a very good idea for Donnie.  Cupcakes.  We want to discuss cupcakes.  Give a call back.  Hey, Donnie Cupcakes.  Donnie Cupcakes on the phone.  Love you.  Miss you.  I'm not going to get to the bottom of the cupcake thing anytime soon.  What happened?  I'm just laughing.  I'm disorganized.  You're doing the message.  Edgar's just chiming in.  Of course.  It's just nonsense.  It's just nonsense.  It's just nonsense.  It's just nonsense. 
[01:40:30]  This show needs to be split into three streams so you can hear everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You should be able to get individual feeds.  That would be great.  Like, oh, I want the Opie feed here.  I'm going to get the Jimmy feed.  No one would want my feed.  Oh.  I don't think they'd want it.  Come on.  You need your feed.  How are you going to walk?  I read Twitter.  I don't think they want my feed.  You can't punch the opster.  They don't want my feed.  I know.  It's not true.  It's okay.  Why wouldn't they want to check out the empties, Matt? 
[01:41:00]  Coke Logic raises a great point on Twitter.  Yeah.  Listeners love when you guys eat on the air.  Raises a sandwich, too.  That's true.  It's chubby.  Fucking creepy shuttin'.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm talking to my agoraphobic friend.  Fucking Coke Logic.  You spend more time indoors than mushrooms in the closet.  Coke Logic says, listeners love when you guys eat on the air.  They'll go nuts for cupcakes at Unmatched.  They will.  He's absolutely right.  That's true. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I say we just replay what Ronnie did on Friday.  We told all our stories.  Make it nice and easy.  Stories.  Have some cardboard cutouts on that stage at Caroline's.  Just go to Caroline's and get interviewed.  Yeah, but that's what we're trying to say, and that's it.  Yeah.  Right.  The interview is no dumb cupcakes, and stop saying it's building towards something else.  Just let this be this.  Don't try to make something more of this.  I don't know what building means.  What does that mean, building towards? 
[01:42:00]  This is going to be this.  People are like, oh, thank God this was in the...  It's building.  It's building.  It's a bug.  But our fans are sitting there going, thank God it's in a small setting because, you know,  it really made sense when they build toward this amazing event.  Uh-huh.  You know how many people just want to see this?  So why wouldn't you just open it up and get a bigger space?  Don't make it wacky.  Or just, if they're going to make it Caroline's, where it's a hard-to-get ticket.  Like, sometimes there's something to be said for a hard-to-get ticket, and that's okay.  Right.  And Caroline's has booze, and, you know, I get people to listen to, and it's fucking loaded. 
[01:42:30]  It's comfortable.  It's a good place for it, but then at least, well, you don't have to get out by 7 o'clock.  That's the problem.  Where the listeners can...  You should start at 7, where the listeners can get off work and come home.  You know, our listeners can't just leave work at 2 o'clock.  We're not going to have any trouble filling it up, though.  No, man, it would be a hard-to-get ticket if it was Giant Stadium.  You know how big we are?  Come on.  Giant Stadium.  That's right.  That's 90,000.  Well, yeah.  All right, give or take a few. 
[01:43:00]  All right, we might have a few empty seats, but not too many.  Behind the stage.  It's going to be an amazing interview.  Check out the empty seats mod.  Limited visibility seats.  Then a meet-and-greet after.  And we go home by 7.  It's an afternoon event.  And then we're standing outside Caroline.  And it's like, schmuck's going, now what?  Schmuck on wheels?  Right.  Yeah, what about a schmuck on wheels?  Fuck him, that cupcake hijacking mix.  I want my cronuts, Henry. 
[01:43:30]  Today.  Today.  You going to talk to a man like Dominique Ansel like that?  What if there's a nice dinner or something afterwards for you guys?  You go to a nice dinner?  That would be good.  I like a nice dinner.  Have a celebrity bring you dessert?  That would be wonderful.  All right.  On roller skates or something.  Wacky.  That's great.  Add it.  Yeah.  All right.  Add it with the wackiness.  There's a paper.  Why don't you tell people how they can go to Unmasked?  Unmasked is going to happen.  I am.  It's fine.  You're not going to blow it off. 
[01:44:00]  They'll figure it out.  We have promos running, right?  Just do the thing, please.  Why'd you fold it the other way?  There.  Win tickets for you and a guest to event, meet and greet, enter, siriusxm.com slash Unmasked.  Go there.  Those are bullet points.  Why don't they do it?  Whatever.  Oh, boy.  This would be a perfect opportunity to promote our Twitters.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, you get a hashtag.  Well, we are going to do a social media giveaway, and we do have a hashtag. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, all right.  So you guys are thinking that way.  Of course.  All right.  That's smart.  First smart thing I've heard.  We're going to live tweet the event.  We're going to involve.  Ooh.  Are we?  Oh, boy.  We're going to involve.  Wow.  What kind of tweets are you going to send out?  Anthony and Cher on the left.  Opie and Cher on the right.  Ronnie in the middle.  Don't ruin it.  Wow.  Really?  We haven't figured out seating position yet.  That's a spoiler.  What kind of tweets are you going to send out?  Question asked.  Question answered. 
[01:45:00]  LOL.  Boo.  And maybe even accepting some questions from the Twitterverse.  Ugh.  I hate that word.  As much as I hate fucking cupcakes.  You like the word Twitterverse?  The Twitterverse.  It sounds like information superhighway.  It's just like.  I know.  It sounds stupid.  Who needs three options?  I don't know.  My point is really simple.  It's just don't do it. 
[01:45:30]  Just don't do it.  Let's see.  Anyway.  Can we talk about Nick Cannon?  Sure.  Nick Cannon is a very stupid human being.  This is just typical.  Your boy is a stupid human being.  This is typical.  I'm not saying boy because he's black.  I've been saying boy a lot.  Because he's my boy.  Like my friend.  But he's a very stupid person.  He did the white face thing.  And he wasn't stupid to do that because he got people talking. 
[01:46:00]  Got him some ink.  White people party music.  About his new album or whatever.  His new download.  Whatever the kids are saying these days.  But then he has to go on.  Because he got a lot of shit for doing it.  And a lot of people are saying what's the difference between doing white face and black face.  Yeah.  And if you don't want.  My point is if you don't want people to do black face shit.  Then you probably shouldn't do white face shit.  Right?  Exactly.  Simple as that.  There it is.  Can I.  Oh.  All right.  This is what he's.  His explanation for this. 
[01:46:30]  Which I know what the explanation was.  This is where this is bullshit.  And I like Nate Man.  But this is what he did that annoys me.  Right.  When you talk about black face from the 20s and the 30s.  He's right.  That was an oppressive awful thing.  Where blacks were not allowed to perform.  And then you know.  My man.  My man.  Degrading.  How I love ya.  Horrible shit.  And that type of black face.  Like that.  That old school.  Fucking disgusting.  Sambo caricature.  He's accurate.  I'm with you.  That.  That point.  But what he did here.  He did something with this explanation. 
[01:47:00]  On the back burner the whole time.  Yeah.  Like.  Yeah.  They're going to get controversy.  But I have this ace in the hole.  I will say.  This.  It was almost like this whole thing was designed.  What's that?  What suit is that ace?  It's a diamond answer.  Oh shit.  It's.  Wrong.  The whole thing was designed just so he could back and say.  Well no.  This is about.  An impression.  Not oppression.  He made a blanket statement.  Which is bullshit.  Period.  Yeah.  Play this.  Warm blanket statement. 
[01:47:30]  Which was an electric blanket statement.  I hate George Stephanopoulos.  For water on us.  Oh.  God.  I don't like this guy either.  Can you show me one guy I like today?  I don't think so.  I don't think it's possible.  Well this guy is a fraud too.  Cannon joins us now.  Great to have you back on GMA.  Good to be here George.  Thanks for having me.  You knew exactly what you were doing.  I did.  I really did.  Yeah.  You know what I mean.  It was one of the things right there.  For one second Sam.  Can you imagine.  Again.  I know.  But if a white performer did a little bit of a black face thing. 
[01:48:00]  And said I'm doing black people party music.  Can you imagine George Stephanopoulos giving him the same good natured introduction.  You know what you did.  That's why he's a fraud.  They're all frauds.  Go ahead.  The double standard between black people and white people is astounding.  And there is no white privilege so shut up.  Rizent.  I have him titled and doing the character.  I knew it would spark some controversy.  But I felt like it's a conversation that's needed because we all have differences.  We embrace it.  I talk about it. 
[01:48:30]  It's going to happen.  Well then just have the conversation.  The second you have the.  First of all hold on.  The second you start the conversation you're a fucking racist if you're white.  Black people.  Oh feel free to start the conversation.  And then the second whitey jumps in and tries to contribute to the conversation.  You're a racist.  Or if you make a point in the discussion.  What a lot of people do is they'll say.  Well they'll invoke white privilege and say.  Well because of your white privilege.  It's almost like as a person.  Like no matter what your opinion is.  They're going to say well white privilege.  You know.  Was it white privilege when I was in a gas station. 
[01:49:00]  Bathroom warming myself on the fucking hand dryer.  Shut it.  White privilege my ass.  If you're an articulate black man in this day and age.  A young black man.  Very articulate.  Well educated.  And well dressed.  Well spoken.  You will get a fucking job.  So much quicker than a white guy.  So much fucking quicker.  It's a commodity to have a well spoken well educated young black man to apply for a fucking job. 
[01:49:30]  So stop it.  Right.  With the white privilege bullshit.  Is there any.  Does white privilege exist at all though.  I mean like.  It's hard for me to even ask this question without getting annoyed.  You can call it white privilege.  But it's not white privilege.  It's white people and any other person being treated in a like fashion to how they treat other people for the most part.  There are horrible people on every fucking racial ethnic cultural makeup.  But black people being so upset about the way they're treated in this society is a direct reflection as to how they're they're functioning in this society as a whole as a group as a people. 
[01:50:00]  And if you want to be treated like that in many other aspects with having your own separate cultural clubs and and channels and award shows and all these other things to to be separatists from the rest of the nation.  Then you have to be accepted as a group with the bad things that are happening.  The 75 plus percent illegitimacy rate. 
[01:50:30]  The 50 percent prison population rate.  All those other things that that are running rampant.  The violence running rampant in the black community.  Then you have to also embrace those and solve those fucking problems.  I mean I mean I mean just just white privilege.  I've been thinking about it lately because I keep seeing it and it annoys me.  It fucking annoys me when I see it.  But I'm like okay just detaching myself.  Just being like a smart guy.  Is there any truth to it? 
[01:51:00]  Like it's not just because you're white.  Is there Asian privilege?  Is there Asian privilege?  In America I'm saying.  Is it?  I'm saying.  Is there Asian privilege?  The fact that Asians can walk around in a store and not be followed let's say.  That's not because they're white or black or brown or any other color.  It's based on a behavior that is then reacted upon by other people.  What is but what is white privilege considered?  White privilege is considered the ability to go into a store and not be followed. 
[01:51:30]  To go in and get a job.  To get a mortgage.  Just to get things that you work for.  And you do.  You work for them and you get them.  And for some reason that's considered a privilege and not an earned thing that you just get because you've gone through the process.  But if somebody following certain people is a reaction to behavior.  Yeah.  How come the way blacks view America isn't a reaction to America's behavior? 
[01:52:00]  Like how come that's annoying but not seen as a reaction to America's behavior?  I don't know.  It could have been years ago but I think we're well past that point.  I think now there's a shift in behavior whereas white America, which barely is even white America anymore, is a lot more, I don't know, a lot nicer to minorities than it was years ago.  You've got to agree with that.  I mean, I think the number of lynchings is way down from the fucking early 1900s. 
[01:52:30]  But then we've had that shift the other way, too, where some of the behaviors of certain ethnic backgrounds and cultures has just gotten deplorable.  It's fucked up.  Let's go back to the Nutanen clip.  Oh.  Someone's not paying attention.  Conversation.  It was a topic.  I'm going to take his hood off after my speech.  But what about the people who did call it racist and said, you know, if someone went out there in blackface, there'd be all kinds of uproar. 
[01:53:00]  You know, without getting too serious, because, you know, everybody's really sensitive when it comes to race.  And that's even one of the reasons why I did it.  But if we want to have that.  That is the reason you did it?  Yes, of course.  But if we want to have that real conversation, I mean, it's even funny, like, they're using this term in whiteface.  Like, I don't really know what that is.  I know blackface was a term that was created in 1869 to describe offensive minstrel shows.  Whiteface, if you look it up and Google it, it's a sea slope up in upstate New York. 
[01:53:30]  So, this term that we created, you know what I mean?  I was doing a character impression.  Blackface is about oppression.  So, if you really want to have that conversation, we'd love to have that conversation.  And, of course, you'd be shut up immediately because it would be racist if you tried to defend blackface.  But not every person putting blackface on is doing oppression.  Black people always want to have the conversation until you start talking.  Sometimes they are doing the impression.  Yeah.  He wanted to talk.  That's a blanket statement.  That's bullshit.  How about it's a genuine impression where it's not just taking black charcoal and rubbing it on your face and putting a big white mark around your mouth. 
[01:54:00]  How about you legitimately put on an Afro wig.  You take brown makeup, make up yourself, maybe use a prosthetic to change your nose or lips or something, and then go out and do some type of an act.  You would be crucified.  But that isn't traditional blackface.  That's doing exactly what he did.  Although Robert Downey Jr. did get away, as he should have.  He got away with it.  There was no issues.  I mean, maybe a couple people complained. 
[01:54:30]  There was a couple of complaints.  But he got some shit.  There was some shit.  And he's getting some shit.  I mean.  Yeah.  But, I mean, to say that every person that puts blackface on is doing some oppression shit, that's just not right.  See, Nick Cannon's kind of known as a comedian.  He's not really known for doing a lot of racial stuff.  Right.  So I think that he kind of, like, sometimes you want to make a statement about something, and this was his way to do it.  Yeah.  But I think this is where he wanted it to go, which is fine.  But just say that.  Of course.  If anyone fires out, blackface was created in 1869 without having had that answer ready. 
[01:55:00]  Of course.  Like, he realized he probably was reading about it and got fucking furious and was like, I'm going to have this conversation.  How do I do it?  You can't just bring up minstrel shows for no reason.  He needed a defense already put up for this.  Yeah.  So he did a little research, and he's able to spit this shit out.  Let's go.  Is there more to this?  It's all that?  I don't want to do all that.  Just another two minutes.  Oh, shit. 
[01:55:30]  Sorry.  And my issue is not with Nick Cannon, really.  It's like Stephanopoulos and the media would react.  Nick Cannon is just doing what he wants to do.  Of course.  But he's making excuses.  Nick is making excuses.  And a huge double standard.  Let's see where this goes.  To me, this was to have fun and to put it out there.  Yes, we have issues with race in this country, in this world.  But it doesn't have to be with hatred.  You know, it's a big difference between humor and hatred.  Here's one question.  A lot of people talk about this, but they even got into the title of your album, White People 
[01:56:00]  Party Music.  Here's what Shawnee Marie posted on Facebook.  Would it be the same if Eminem's album was black people rapper music?  Just saying.  What do you say to that?  Why can't you ask that question as a journalist, you coward?  He's like, oh, thank God someone tweeted.  But why do you need to read a Facebook comment?  You're a fucking interviewer.  You would ask the same question if you were brave.  Why don't you ask the question?  Because they don't want to be connected to any of this shit.  That's why they're always, oh, people are saying, word on the street is, people on Twitter have a problem with. 
[01:56:30]  Right, say, hey, wouldn't it be the same if, that's why I don't like the guy.  Yeah, little chicken shit.  And what do you say to that?  I bet you if Eminem named his album black people rapper music, it'd still go platinum.  People get so sensitive.  It gets about this whole, like, double standard.  It reminds me of my kids a little bit.  Like, you know, when one gets away with something, they point the finger.  Like, why does he get to do it? 
[01:57:00]  Who's pointing the finger?  Who's pointing the finger every time?  I'm an artist.  I get the opportunity to create as long as I can embrace it.  You know, of course, everything's going to come with consequences and a little heat.  But if I could take the heat, I'd rather.  Well, it seems like you can take the heat.  This is also your first album in more than a decade.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  It's interesting because I feel like, it doesn't feel like that time has went.  Because obviously, I've still been in music for quite some time.  You know, I've had a recording radio show.  Mariah.  You know, my calendar for years. 
[01:57:30]  So I've been dealing with music there.  I've had jobs at record labels.  I have my own record label with artists.  So I think it was just one of those things where it was like, oh, I forgot to put an album out.  Because I'm so busy doing everything else.  But I really wanted to do it from a place of just like, yo, this is fun.  I'm feeling you.  From the title to the characters.  Like, if you listen to the album, it's so funny.  It's a bunch of stuff that's probably going to cause controversy.  But it all comes from a good place.  You've been having some fun, too.  So why can't it come from a good place when a white guy does it?  Well, you know, why can't it be? 
[01:58:00]  Because that's where people will invoke white privilege.  Like, what you just said.  Right, right.  And it's like, no, just admit that, like, you're kind of like a little bit of a double standard.  Just admit that.  You've got, like, you know, you just admitted that.  You've got the advantage of a double standard.  Period.  In the language, and as far as being in trouble with politically correct things, yes.  I imagine a white guy goes, I'm just coming from a good place.  It's coming from a good place.  Maybe they offended some people, but I'm telling you, it's coming from a good place.  The scarlet letter R on your fucking sweater. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, enjoy the double standard.  Enjoy it.  And by the way.  Admit there's a double standard.  Admit that if a white guy did exactly what you're doing, he would be fired.  If there is a white privilege, it was fucking earned.  It's fucking earned in this country.  Yes, you could wince, Jimmy.  I see you wincing.  I'm not wincey.  I'm more thinking about what you're saying.  It was earned by a people that came here, and you could say whatever you want.  They decimated the Indians.  What the fuck ever.  It was back in the day, like, when you're buying a property, a monopoly. 
[01:59:00]  It's a different fucking age and a different part of the game.  And it was built up.  And don't say on the backs of slaves.  Of course, I understand there was some fucking slavery in this country.  I do understand that.  But the entire country was not built off slavery.  And the ideas for the technology that came forth, and all the industry that came after slavery, please.  And for this privilege thing to be thrown about, this country was made great and built by the people in this country. 
[01:59:30]  So if there's any privilege, it was earned.  It was earned, but it was, I don't agree with that totally, because I feel like, here's where America has been, like you said, well, that was just a different time.  Certainly.  But the Constitution stands up.  Like, it wasn't so different a time that we don't listen to what the forefathers said about our form of government.  The Constitution has been altered, believe me.  And it's just been trounced upon, especially of late.  But you know what I'm saying.  It's like, that's the document that built the country, and that was in the same time. 
[02:00:00]  I don't look at it like it was earned, like...  But it's amended.  It's amended to suit the times, and some of the archaic thinking has been, you know, pulled out of it and changed.  I can't consider that, because to me that was just such an unfair and shitty thing.  And I'm okay with it.  That's our history.  And we've got to say, that's our history.  Exactly.  And we shouldn't be apologetic about it.  Many countries' histories are a lot worse than the United States.  That's true.  And it still goes on today.  And there hasn't been any kind of updating of some other countries' deplorable treatment of their people. 
[02:00:30]  But is it earned, though, like, the fucking lie we take?  It embarrasses me as an American.  But you can't take the bad things and have it negate the good things of a people.  So you look at the United States in the early days of this country.  Yes, there were horrible things going on.  But the amazing things that were going on can't be...  You can't take that away, because there were also horrible things going on that were completely accepted at the time, is what I'm saying. 
[02:01:00]  So when I say white privilege, or just American privilege, was earned, it was earned.  It was earned by a people that built an amazing country, built industry, innovation, went to the moon.  Things like that.  And that earns you respect, and earns you the ability to do things and be treated a certain way.  But there's a point to that, but there's also that the base of it, the guts of it, was built in a big part on a lie. 
[02:01:30]  And the lie was that every person here is going to be treated fairly.  Exactly.  And I'm not an American.  I love this country.  But I mean, I'm just trying to be very balanced when I look at it.  It was built on the lie that people are treated equally.  And literally, fucking women...  We should be embarrassed by the fact that women couldn't vote until the 1920s.  But it was fixed.  It was realized that it was bad and fixed. 
[02:02:00]  There are countries where it never gets fixed.  That's true.  And every country has its problems.  America had and still has just huge problems.  But if you look at them, acknowledge them, and in time they get remedied, you've got to move the fuck on.  But this is what we're seeing now.  And I hate it, too, a lot of it.  I hate a lot of it.  This is what moving on is.  See, we're not 50 years down the road moved on.  This is where we are in the moving on thing.  But there's not a group woman mentality of violence and of, I don't know, this victimization. 
[02:02:30]  There is an underlying thing, but that's just the male-female thing.  That goes anywhere in the world.  I think you'll see that.  What I'm saying is there's not this fucking thing, this black cloud that's lingering over women or Jews,  the way they were treated over the years.  Because they've transcended the oppression. 
[02:03:00]  I think Patrice had the best explanation for that, which was, you know, Hitler was killed.  So that was kind of, that was it.  Like, he was the guy.  How did it happen?  Are you kidding?  But there was some sense of fucking finality and being finished with that.  Yeah.  Where here was just this fucking, look, if it had ended a certain way and things had been as promised,  you and I would not be dealing with this shit.  I hear you.  But they're not going to get that.  Like the Hitler thing.  Right.  There's never going to be this solution.  But it's just going to take time. 
[02:03:30]  It's going to take time.  And a lot of time.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot more generations.  Exactly.  This is moving on.  We're not going to see it.  Our kids aren't going to see it.  Their kids aren't going to see it.  But eventually.  Yeah.  Eventually.  It will happen.  It's going to be a long time, though.  Is there more to this clip there, Sam Roberts?  Oh, shit.  It's just plugging.  Oh, Nick Cannon just plugging.  I don't like Nick Cannon.  Yeah, I know.  You enjoy him on your show.  What I hate is the way Nick Cannon says the discussion.  We need the discussion.  President Obama got up with the Trayvon thing afterwards and said, we need a discussion. 
[02:04:00]  A discussion.  Black people always get up and say, we need a discussion.  The second dumb fucking whitey starts having a discussion, he's crucified.  The second he tries to be a little honest about things, or voice an opinion, he's a racist.  I'd rather have the discussion than a get.  Yeah, motherfucker.  I hear you.  All right.  People have comments, but I'm sure some.  Anne Stinks.  Jim's a liberal faggot. 
[02:04:30]  We got it.  Some agree with me.  Some agree with me.  Oh, you got my tweet?  I know you're texting.  How come no one brings up Ted Danson?  That's right.  Ted Danson's playing.  So, I would love to ask Nick Cannon, was Ted Danson doing that to be oppressive?  Did he do...  I thought of Ted Danson, too.  What does he make?  Or was he going for a silly impression?  Did he do like a really over-the-top...  He was dating whoopie.  No, no, no, no.  But it wasn't like he was just doing an impression of a black guy. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, it was minstrel-shell blackface.  Yeah, I think that's what it's called, right?  But it came from a good place.  It did.  Just like Nick Cannon said on Good Morning America.  Oh, boy.  That's oldie time.  But there's whoopie right to his right laughing her ass off.  Just laughing.  Well, she was fucking him.  She had to.  Well, that's true.  But going with Nick Cannon and what he said, that came from a good place.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he was just having a little fun.  Right.  What was it again?  Was it some kind of rose?  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  That came from a good place, but he caught hell for that.  He certainly did.  A quick explanation of privilege.  Hold on.  Let's go to New Orleans.  I was asking that because I keep hearing it.  I'm like, what does it even mean?  Let's go to New Orleans.  It's the new fucking...  It's the new, hey, you're a racist is what it is.  Dan?  Yeah.  Are you called the man?  Yes.  Thank you.  Hi, Mr. Tanner.  Just checking.  Actually, Ozone calls me liberal, Dan.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Anyway, so if it was like a video game, and you could consider privilege to be like, you 
[02:06:00]  know, if you're like black, you might be starting the game on a harder level than a white person  is.  It doesn't necessarily mean that the black person is going to not save the princess.  It doesn't mean that the white person is going to save the princess.  You know, the black person might be more adept at jumping through all the hurdles, and the  white person might not be.  But it's just, you know, those hurdles that exist, for example, like, you know, if you're  a white guy walking around in the streets, you might not get stop and frisked where a 
[02:06:30]  black guy you are going to be.  Now, I will admit, I will absolutely say that, you know, people do drop the privilege bomb,  you know, far too often, and overuse it sometimes, and, you know, sometimes people try to use it  as a pejorative when it's necessarily to be used that way.  Remember that word pejorative?  Oh, boy, I do.  Yeah.  That's why I put my pickles.  Fucking funny.  Thanks.  Wordplay.  I like that shit.  All right.  Anyway, that's just, you know, there's an article, the author, John Scalzi, he had a long article  where he goes into more detail about that. 
[02:07:00]  But, you know, at the end of the day, you have, you know, it's something that a lot of  people, you know, a lot of people use it too much in a negative way and, you know, and  try and villainize people because they're white, therefore they have white people.  All right.  Look, I understand what you're saying is the, you know, the starting line isn't the same  you're saying for blacks and whites.  Um, on certain, uh, in certain aspects.  But, but, I think if you're, like I said, uh, you take the time out to educate yourself, 
[02:07:30]  um, speak proper, properly, uh, the, the excuse that is just given, this blanket pass that  is given to black people, um, in the media, uh, that cannot speak is amazing to me.  When you watch an interview, yeah.  Why do we bring that up?  When you watch, well, that was a while ago.  But yeah, it was fun.  And did blackface.  It's a play on words.  For his old, uh, band.  Yeah.  Did that come from a good place? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  It was live at the Apollo, but we were in front of the Apollo rocket.  Right.  It was a play on words.  Sure.  And it was good natured.  It was good natured.  It was fun.  Came from a good place.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I forgot what I was saying now.  Oh, I fucked you.  Yeah, it's all right.  Oh, shit.  About white privilege.  Yeah, I know, but I forgot where I was.  I forgot my place.  Oh, you're talking about the, um, the, um, the religion, you know, I'm not sorry.  You're talking about the, uh, the education of somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're, if you're an educated black man, uh, uh, young black man, instead of, instead 
[02:08:30]  of getting, uh, pushed aside and, and your starting line being way in the back, you're  going to have the privilege.  You're going to be the one that gets to, uh, take a few steps in front of the white person  for, for a job or, um, for the way you're treated, uh, maybe treated by the police.  If you're pulled over and you're courteous and well-spoken, I absolutely believe you're  not going to get that fucking old racist cop that's just going to work you over, um, 
[02:09:00]  if, if, if you're not acting like a thug.  Sorry.  It's generations.  I'm just going to take, dude, this is what, cause what you're saying is right, but it's  also like, you said something before.  Well, how is the next generation going to transcend this one if they're just being taught the  same shit?  It's, it's one of the, I don't speak fucking pants hanging around your ass, uh, uh, no respect  of family, of, of authority, of work ethic.  We promise you this, we don't deliver it.  We send you off to fight. 
[02:09:30]  You come back, you're called a nigger and sent that.  I'm only saying, I understand.  So it's like, when you look at like, uh, balance and accountability for a long fucking  time, things were, I'm not saying that that's why people go out and shoot each other.  We are suffering for the fuck ups of people before us because they lied.  We are suffering, but the better shit gets in this country for black people and the more  opportunities that pop up for black people that want to, you know, educate themselves, 
[02:10:00]  like I said, and work hard.  It seems that behaviorally and, and, and with things like, like a family ethic, it just  seems to get worse and worse.  The illegitimacy rate, the fucking, uh, uh, uh, father's just, just leaving, um, the, the,  the, uh, the lack of, of respect of authority.  See, that seems to just be getting worse.  Well, a lot of that too, and this is not all the, but the press, when you look at the  way the press covers it, you know, most people don't even know what goes on.  I think they cover up, um, a lot of the, yeah. 
[02:10:30]  The guilty white people don't cover it.  So it's, it's not even spoken about, but it just seems like things should be getting  better because the environment is getting better and it is getting better.  It seems like it's getting better, but it's going to need a lot more time.  We are in that place and it's annoying to be in that fucking, that place.  Fontaine.  Yeah.  Hey guys, how you doing?  Uh, it's been a while Fontaine.  So I guess that means we haven't talked about race in a while.  Anthony, I love you so much, but you make me so fucking mad because that's something 
[02:11:00]  that you always, well, good, touche, yeah, the thing that you fail to consider is Jim  Norton is going to be at Caroline, April 24th.  An excellent point, Fontaine.  God damn it.  Thank you.  I hate this.  Bravo.  Well done.  Ha.  Bravo.  Racist.  All right.  I'm performing on the moon.  You are?  I perfiles.  That's a good fall.  That's a perfect fall. 
[02:11:30]  I just need the right amount of phlegm in it.  Yeah, that was good, right?  You know, I like to do this.  I'm performing.  Yeah?  What are you doing?  You're like thrusting your hips.  Just making a chip face.  Oh.  That's good.  Yeah, you're good for no one.  What to do?  I'm confused.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Is that hanging with Ozzy all night?  I'm tired.  Ozzy kept me up late.  We got very good news. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, no.  We got fired?  We don't do April Fool's pranks anymore.  Oh, no.  But radio is doing April Fool's pranks today.  Ooh.  Radio.  Anything good?  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  They're not.  Oh, no.  April showers bring May flowers.  And May flowers bring non-documented workers who break your grandmother's lamp because they  didn't use a packing blanket.  The touch on in the morning 95-5.  W-P-L-J. 
[02:12:30]  New York.  Okay.  Up.  Hello.  My name is Doris Gibbles from Brooklyn.  For some time now, my husband has been, well, dumb.  Don't get me wrong.  He's a nice man.  He's just dumber than a bag of dryer lint.  We've been married for 16 years and have two wonderful children and a third child that  inherited the dumb from Ed.  That's my husband, whose name used to be Norman, but he had trouble spelling it. 
[02:13:00]  So we had to have it changed.  Anyway, my dumb husband Ed and I went to the doctor because Ed forgot how to shave and use  the iron instead of his razor.  And that's when Dr. Kleinberg told us about dumb aspirin.  It's like regular aspirin, but it's specifically formulated for dummies like Ed.  What is this?  I'm Dr. Kleinberg.  My specially blended formula of dumb aspirin gets in the bloodstream of the dummies and  turns on the neurons in the brain that have been unused for years.  Like spinach is the pot pie.  Like that voice too.  Dumb aspirin is the dummies. 
[02:13:30]  Results may vary.  Anyone allergic to Kool-Aid or cocaine should take my product anyway.  My husband Ed seems to be responding to the dumb aspirin.  Yesterday he actually answered the phone and said, hello, instead of, buddy the elf, what's  your favorite color?  Dumbass aspirin.  If it can't help your man, he's just a dumbass.  And we welcome E-Rock to the studio.  Speaking of, I'm kidding, of course.  I already did the play of words.  You didn't have to make it that obvious.  Oh, okay. 
[02:14:00]  Ah, E-Rock.  They're monitoring the Todd show today for April Fool's.  I see.  What the fuck was that?  Was that an April Fool's thing?  That was, somebody decided to bring bits back to the show since the first week after  we destroyed them.  So this was the first day he decided to do a bit.  Oh.  And then it goes into April Fool's.  Oh, and he's actually doing the April Fool's thing?  So that was a bit.  That was a bit.  Ah.  He hasn't done a bit or a parody since that first week.  All right.  Well, I'm glad we're right back on it. 
[02:14:30]  Yep.  It's a good day to listen to him again.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere, we hear Todd's inner dialogue.  What's that mean?  This is the new thing that's revolutionizing our radio.  Oh, no.  It's just a tape going, I stink.  I stink.  I stink.  Right now in Midtown Manhattan, what's going on, Annie?  Michael Jackson album release, eight new songs, Mets opening day, de Blasio gets booed, and  seven million sign up for Obamacare.  Well, before I asked Annie about the headlines, I already knew exactly what she was going to say. 
[02:15:00]  Of course I did.  But in doing so, I placed importance on her role and gave her the confidence she'll need when I ask her to help me do live commercials.  Making a person feel good isn't always about flowers and all-day suckers.  Sometimes it's simply about being human.  Something I know how to fake very well.  In sports, the Mets blew a ninth inning lead.  That was a bit.  What was that?  It's supposed to be that they're having their regular show and regular conversation. 
[02:15:30]  And then out of nowhere, his inner dialogue just kind of comes in.  Oh, Kevin Spacey.  House of Cards.  House of Cards.  The House of Cards thing, yeah.  I loved House of Cards, but I didn't like that at all.  You didn't like his rendition?  No.  Well, why don't you give it a chance?  That was great.  That was fantastic.  That was a great game.  I blame you, sir.  Why's that?  Because you were texting me all through the game.  Man, Mets are looking great, boy.  They look fantastic.  I'm beatable.  You know what?  I agree with you, Monk. 
[02:16:00]  It's imperative Monkey Boy knows I have his back.  Agreeing with him on a subject he knows I've been wrestling with solidifies our bond.  This move not only strengthens our public and private relationship,  it makes him believe I have a romantic interest in him.  Which, of course, I do not.  At least not yet.  Cooper's got some fresh show.  Fuck off.  Oh, enough of this guy.  You don't like this bit?  That's not even like an April Fool's thing. 
[02:16:30]  It's a bit.  I don't know.  It's a bit, right?  It was done by 6.30.  But it's not an April Fool's.  And there's a double shot?  We don't have to play that, right?  It's just two more of those back-to-back.  And then he has a problem with his flight, Belgium?  Yeah, you don't need to go to that.  What is that?  Play April Fool's.  Is it finally an April Fool's?  Huh?  It's an April Fool's phone scam.  Oh, no.  We have to play the April Fool's phone scam.  We do.  Because those were just bits.  But we've got Amy Schumer standing by. 
[02:17:00]  So we're going to take a break, talk to Amy Schumer,  and then maybe get back to that or something else.  All right?  Stay there.  Ah, the distraction.  The love of Amy Schumer in the studio.  And I've got to do a read.  Oh, my God.  It's about Inside Amy Schumer.  I'm not kidding.  It's back.  Season 2 on Comedy Central.  She's sitting right here.  This is crazy.  This is awesome.  Yes, Season 2.  Amy, apparently you toured the country doing stand-up.  That's right.  And did a couple of Comedy Central roasts.  And then you landed your own show on Comedy Central. 
[02:17:30]  Is this true?  Bam!  This is crazy.  Season 2 premieres tonight, this evening, 10.30, 9.30 Central.  That's right.  In the first season, I guess, what did you do?  You used sketches, stand-up, woman-on-the-street interviews  to show everybody that you aren't afraid.  Oh, does it say that?  It says this, Amy.  I've been reading this for a couple of days.  This is so embarrassing.  And I've been like, oh, man, I know what Amy's all about  and the show and everything.  But here's what it says.  You're not afraid to make fun of anyone, anything, including herself. 
[02:18:00]  Ew.  Who wrote this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm so glad the person's here while I do this.  Like, I feel so humiliated reading this right now.  Oh, Amy.  We all have cooties now.  She embraced her inner porn star.  That's what you did.  Nice.  You tried to make your own math lab.  You got really touchy-feely as a yoga instructor.  Later, you went on Jimmy Fallon and proposed that there be a Hooters for women, right? 
[02:18:30]  This would make me never want to see this show.  I would be like, okay, is there a way to block a show from your DVD?  Right, right.  Oh, my God.  It's good stuff.  Anyway, this season, you've declared yourself the It Girl for sluts.  No.  But apparently, if it says it here, it's going to be true.  I have a line in my stand-up about a TMZ dude coming up to me saying that.  That is so disgusting.  You've declared yourself.  Oh, you're holding back nothing.  It's so humiliating. 
[02:19:00]  Why?  It's a really terrific...  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  It tells you all about the program and what you're doing.  Oh, my God.  It says that I've declared myself the It Girl for sluts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so awful.  But then it says things like you find out you've got herpes, you eat a guy's face off,  you play frumpy meerkat who doesn't wear panties.  Like, I don't know what that is.  I guess this person's mad at me.  And get therapy from supermodel Chrissy Teigen.  And then it says things just get dirtier from there.  That's so...  Like, what?  I love this.  Why? 
[02:19:30]  Right?  Well, you made a declaration.  I think that's fair.  You did.  You declared.  I do declare.  Can you imagine?  Like, I'm the It Girl, guys.  I'm the It Girl for sluts.  Is there anything worse than copy written about you?  There's nothing that is humiliating to a performer more.  Who wrote this?  I want to have a meeting with the person who wrote this.  Like, what's wrong with you?  And it says, if you want to get back, hold on, Inside Amy Schumer, like fucking you.  Sam, who wrote this?  I'm trying to cutting myself. 
[02:20:00]  I think Amy did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Amy.  All right.  I did it.  I played it.  I love it.  I wrote it.  The important part is that Amy, the premiere of season two of Inside Amy Schumer,  is on Comedy Central tonight.  It's 10.30, 9.30 in that central time zone.  And that's right after, what a crappy lead in Tosh.0.  Who watches that?  No one watches that show.  Holy Jesus.  That's not true.  A lot of people watch that show.  Oh, literal Jimmy.  Is he in it?  That's on Comedy Central.  Jimmy's in a bunch of the episodes. 
[02:20:30]  Look, I'm crumbling it.  I'll never read it again.  Not in that way, anyway.  Oh, thank you.  Please never read it again.  I like the way Amy asked, is Jim on tonight?  Oh.  Jimmy's in some episodes.  Jim's on season.  Oh, no.  You are on it tonight.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Way to start off with a bang.  That's good.  Amy is here.  It's got good reviews, too.  I read something where they said it was really, really funny.  They'll see that.  Yeah.  Well, she's the it girl for sluts.  Oh.  Oh.  Isn't that terrible? 
[02:21:00]  It's the worst.  Oh, no.  I got to start by saying you were great on Ellen DeGeneres.  I watched yesterday.  You did?  Thank you.  Thank you.  I actually like Ellen DeGeneres.  Yeah.  As a stand-up.  I mean, her show is a little goofy at times.  Right.  But she does a good interview.  No, it's not for you.  But Amy was on, so I had to watch.  Thank you.  She loves you.  We hit it off.  She actually loved...  She was laughing.  What do you mean?  I think she was psyched that Lindsay Lohan wasn't out there anymore.  She hated Lindsay, right?  I don't know.  Well, actually, we filmed two different days.  Oh, you did? 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  Okay, because it was the same...  I was going to ask you how she was.  No, because we watched the whole episode because Lindsay Lohan was on as well.  Oh, the truth comes out.  That's why you guys are right.  And Ellen, yeah, Ellen looked like she hated Lindsay Lohan, but I was just playing it right  because she's friends with Oprah and shit.  Do dish, Opie.  Do dish.  Lilo said.  Wow.  Was she nice to you or no?  I was not with her.  Oh, was it?  Okay.  Yeah.  I figured you taped it another day because that was yesterday and you would have had a  fly all day just to get here.  Right.  No, I taped it last week, but then they were like, the president's going to do an interview 
[02:22:00]  and I was like, oh my God, I'm meeting the president.  Right.  Just what am I going to wear?  And then they were like, he just did a satellite thing.  And I was like, can I pop my hat?  They were like, you'll be nowhere near anywhere he could possibly see you.  But he might watch and know that he was all of the projects, give him a tape of himself.  He'll have to wait.  He'll never.  Let me turn this on.  He likes comedy, though.  He's a big Chappelle fan.  He probably knows who you are.  I got to ask.  Ellen gave you a gift.  What happens to those things? 
[02:22:30]  Did you actually bring it home?  She's sending it to me.  Really?  Well, she's not.  Imagine she's at FedEx.  I need to get this to Amy Schumer.  Ben Loz.  Yeah.  No.  It's a huge painting.  Right.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, it was because my sister and I went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party and we got invited  because I guess everyone else was dead.  Not everyone, Amy.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jimmy.  You're a cadaver, Jimmy.  No one believes that you're a cult. 
[02:23:00]  You guys got all dressed up.  I saw the tweets.  Yeah.  Great tweets.  I got decked.  Thank you.  Decked out.  But then once we got there, we saw the Sports Illustrated models walking around.  Who was the coolest person you met there?  That I met?  Oh, Don Rickles.  I'd never met him.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, he was like, I was trying to hang with him and Brian Grazer, some really important  executive was next to him, but I just wanted a picture with Riggles, so I was trying to  be like, hi, can you get out of the picture?  Yeah, could you just get the hell going on? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  And he's like, do you ever want to work in this fucking industry?  Oh, man.  I just want a Riggles picture.  But yeah, so, oh, and the Hemsworth brothers were there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, those like hot Aussies.  We had one of them, man.  We had Kristen.  We had Kristen, I think, yeah.  That's the Thor one?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And they're both like ridiculously fuckable, but by this point in the night.  She means O.P. and Anthony, by the way.  Oh, yes.  I was just easily raped.  The company thinks we're easily fuckable. 
[02:24:00]  But by that time of the night, we had already taken our heels off and like, just we,  we might as well have had cocks, like with how much we were the least hot people there.  Oh, I don't believe it.  Believe it.  All right.  So, yeah.  I believe it.  Yeah, you do believe it.  All right.  Was that Nina Abgal girl there, that Sports Illustrated swimsuit?  Yeah, just tit, like perfect tits, walking around on two poles with like an unbelievable pussy.  Like her pussy was actually a honeypot.  Yes.  Wow.  And, yeah, and people were just like asking me like if I was a scrotum. 
[02:24:30]  And it was disgusting.  And then, and so I asked my sister, so I wasn't even scared to go up to those brothers  and be like, can I have a picture with you?  Because they'd be like, oh, who's this guy?  They're like, oh, my God, Paula Deen's at this party.  So, I go over and I'm like, so I'm like, Kim, take a picture of us.  And she takes the blurriest picture.  We're like, we're not even decipherable as humans.  And I was so pissed at her.  I'm like, like, blew it so bad.  So, I just talked about that on Ellen.  And so, at the end of the segment, she was like, well, where do we feel bad that happened? 
[02:25:00]  And she brought out a huge painting that she made of the brothers and me in focus.  It's almost life, life size.  It's like a giant.  Oh, it's gigantic.  It's gigantic.  That's why.  It's like an oil painting.  That's why I asked the question, like, what happens to that stuff to you?  What are you going to do?  Now, are you stuck with this and have to bring it home?  It's not to me, but I live in a, you know, I live in a tiny one-bedroom where it's bigger  than the wall.  Yeah, it'll take up the entire, but whatever.  I'm psyched.  Yeah.  Did you have the flash on?  Show them the picture. 
[02:25:30]  The flash isn't the problem.  Kim, show them the picture.  No, always have the flash on because it's easier to take a little bit of the, trust me.  They show the picture on Ellen.  Excuse us, Ansel.  No, no.  I learned the hard way.  Before Kevin Hart was making a lot of money, he came to a core dinner with me and he was taking  photos of me and he fucked up my Charlton Heston picture.  He fucked up my B.B. King picture.  Oh, shit.  Kevin Hart's a horrible photographer.  He's a bad friend.  You can say Kevin Hart took the picture, though.  That's kind of cool.  That's great.  That's the stage of my career I'm at now.  I'm happy Kevin Hart.  What do you mean about a court dinner?  What's that?  Court, your Congress of Racial Equality. 
[02:26:00]  Roy Ennis runs it.  Oh, I like how you just saw a court dinner.  Oh, yeah.  It has to be speaking.  Anthony's a huge advocate.  I'm a huge supporter.  They're number one.  The conservative black organization.  Oh, oh, well, that, I kind of like that.  It's not in one part.  Keep them in line.  Look at that.  That's great.  Why would you take it through a curtain, though?  Let me see.  How many times did they bring in the fog machines that this is the picture?  That's great.  Wowee.  It's shame.  She's got to walk around the room and show everyone.  Match.  Match.  That is a horrible picture.  Match. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, Samsung alert.  Oh, look.  I got the watch.  Galaxy Note 3.  And I got one that I never used.  But we got white glove service.  Look at that.  We get everything for free.  Oh, wow.  They have it, too.  I got the stupid watch.  Nice.  I love the watch.  Do you like the watch?  Does she have the watch?  She's got the watch.  She's got the watch.  She's wearing the watch.  She's wearing the watch.  All right.  Anyway.  Do you have them synced?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, Jimmy.  How about yours?  I have to have the meeting.  I was busy that day.  Yes, you were.  She had like a five-hour meeting with the Samsung person.  That's what we did.  Oh, so she is white glove. 
[02:27:00]  White glove treatment.  We were gone for so long.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  That's some fun stuff right there.  I love it.  Learning about everything about the dumb watch.  The great watch.  It's not a good watch.  I swear, please.  I want the five.  I want the smaller watch.  Thank you.  Yeah.  What did you do?  So Ellen just interviewed you?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  She said she'd be supportive of a comedian.  She was.  She's been really nice.  It was more than supportive.  I want to say it for Amy.  Like, she was genuinely laughing her ass off.  You could tell when someone's just laughing just to kind of help them say it.  Maybe a little romance.  Maybe a little romance.  I wish.  But you know what?  It's like, anytime I've done any show like that, I think, oh, I'll tell it. 
[02:27:30]  Because you just see actresses on there telling some boring story.  Oh, God, their story.  I mean, it just makes you want to scream.  It's just like, oh, what?  You swam with the dolphins?  Like, who gives a shit?  And there's never a punchline or a finish to it.  It's just this nothing linear story.  And the vibe of, like, the male host who will be like, it's supposed to be, like, she's  like, Scarlett Johansson, like, well, I've always had a crush on you.  And they're like, oh, no, you haven't. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  The audience.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you have to pretend, like, oh, and then what did you, you walked with the tigers?  Like, no one cares.  And I always prepare a story like that.  And I'm like, oh, wait, no, I'm a comic.  Let me just try to be funny.  And I was watching Wanda, like, Wanda on Ellen.  And she, you know, just, and she killed.  And I was like, I'm glad I saw that before I went on, because I just have to go on and  do stand-up.  Did you pretty much just kind of kind of wing it?  No.  I was like, okay, I'm going to, I, no, I did it like a set a little bit.  Oh, okay, great.  Chris Rock said that to me once. 
[02:28:30]  He was just like, no, you have to kill.  Like, you're a comedian.  Yeah, yeah.  No one wants to hear your fucking vacation story.  There I was.  Right.  I always slip a note when I go right out, you know, feed me clitoral circumcision.  I got something on it.  Oh, my God, I miss you.  I know.  I missed the dinner.  I had a set that night.  I was bummed.  Oh.  It was last minute.  Yeah, it was very last minute.  I want to go.  Yeah.  Amy is just blowing up.  Yeah, Amy is doing this very nice.  Oh, stop.  She's actually lost some weight. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, thank you.  You know me, up and down, up and down.  You do look great, Amy.  I've always been in lust with you, and I'm a good judge of how good you look, and you  look fantastic.  Thank you.  I think so.  As someone who's seen me in a bikini, I appreciate it.  I know.  That was one of the greatest fucking things, is to try not to look at Amy's ass at the  4th of July party.  Good luck.  I know.  It was rough.  I'm like, I need two seats next to each other. 
[02:29:30]  No.  That was a fun little beach party.  Yeah, that was.  It was just fun watching Keith Robinson try and pretend he could swim.  Yeah.  Oh, that was cute.  Did he really go in?  He went in, he was drunk, and he was confused.  Keith doesn't get drunk.  He was confused.  I think he just, you know, he has, like, too much confidence of things he can't do, and  I think he forgot he could swim.  But he was angry.  He was, like, punching the waves.  Yeah, he was.  He was punching the waves.  He confronted the ocean.  He was playing the knockout game with waves.  Exactly.  He should have done the same thing with a high school diploma. 
[02:30:00]  Fucking moron.  He's taking it out on the waves.  Oh, yeah.  It was so funny to watch it.  He was in, like, fucking waist-deep water.  And he was ducking so the waves looked higher.  Splashing himself.  I'm a coward.  I've never rooted for an undertow harder.  See that fucking...  We see his glasses.  I just wanted to see no Keith and floating glasses.  I mean, he's willing to tsunami.  Doing a rain dance.  She did a rain stick on the shore.  Yeah, that was quite fun.  I normally don't like the beach, but that was a lovely day. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Did your mom's place get wrecked during the storm?  Yeah.  During Sandy.  Did she get flooded?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She lost it?  Mm-hmm.  She lost the whole house.  Yeah.  Whoa!  That whole place?  Yeah.  Was she insured?  Look, this isn't really true.  I just told Keith that's why I couldn't go back there.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, no.  She was insured and whatever, but the place was flooded, and I think people are moving back  in those apartments now, but it was really messed up.  Did the pool get full of, like, ocean water?  I bet.  It was, like, full of sand.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  It was so nice. 
[02:31:00]  That was fun, right?  It's a nice place, but we walked in.  Didn't we take a nice walk down the boardwalk?  Yeah.  Hand in hand, Jim.  That was when we did that thing to DeRosa where we bid on Joe's boots on eBay.  Remember?  Oh, my God.  That was the best.  That was the best.  One of the most satisfying.  What happened?  DeRosa was talking about, he's like, man, he's looking at his phone, he's like, I almost  got these boots on eBay.  Find out in five minutes if I get them.  That was a mistake. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, it was Jimmy, Bobby Kelly, Keith, and myself, and we all didn't even look at each  other.  We all just jumped into action.  Because this is fun.  Everybody was bidding on.  So, I run in the house, I'm using my mom's laptop, and Bobby comes in, he's just feeding  us facts.  He's like, they're made by John Fervinos, they cost this much of it.  So, we're like, okay.  So, I buy them.  I bid like $200.  I was like, Matt, DeRosa will never see these boots.  And then, we filmed, I think you filmed him. 
[02:32:00]  That's right.  You filmed him finding out.  So, five minutes later, he goes, damn it.  And we're filming, we're like, oh, what happened, Joe?  And he's like, what a rookie move.  Somebody came in and bid them out.  And he was really disappointed, because he'd been looking at these boots for weeks.  Yeah.  And I was like, I go, oh my God, that's so sad, because this is strange.  I just got a new pair of boots.  And he's like, what?  And then, he realized, and we were just like, ah, he's so disappointed.  That's great.  And I think he thought, well, she'll get them and give them to me, but I was like, you'll 
[02:32:30]  never see them.  I'm trying to find the video.  I don't remember exactly what it was, but there is a video.  It was one of the most satisfying things I've ever been upon.  That worked out.  It worked perfectly.  Yeah.  Watch that dunce lose his stupid boots.  Fucking idiot.  Has his eyes on some cowboy boots.  Do you know what's going on outside the building with you?  What do you mean?  Some huge truck that says finger blasters.  Finger blasters?  It's like right outside our building as we talk to you.  What's finger blasters?  The hell?  I love it. 
[02:33:00]  We made a fake commercial called finger blasters for chicken fingers.  Oh.  They look like fingers.  And then the sauce looks just like a pussy.  Like, it's just, it's like a little slit.  And so, and we made this commercial.  And so, they made a truck.  They made the actual chicken finger.  Wow.  It's a huge truck.  It says finger blasters.  Snap a pic of the truck and post it with hashtag InsideAmy to get free food.  Is it good?  And then it has the...  The chicken fingers?  Yeah.  Not really.  Oh.  It says InsideAmy Schumer.  It starts tonight at 1030.  Is it like a white cream sauce or a barbecue? 
[02:33:30]  Because that's a big difference.  It's tiny.  It's salt and vinegar.  Is it?  It's gross.  It looks, it's a tiny slit in the top of it that you can dip.  I would just like ketchup.  I want a picture of it.  Squeeze it on my face.  Yeah?  You don't mind ketchup?  I don't mind.  Yeah, we need to get pictures of it.  Oh, ketchup.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  Just once in a while.  I like my sheets to look like fucking Stax Bed and Goodfellas.  Oh, my God.  Did Carrie have another prom in here? 
[02:34:00]  Exactly.  I don't care.  Yeah, no.  I'm like a Jamaican with that shit.  Don't even prepare my meals.  Just sit outside in the fucking living room.  I can't go for that at all.  No?  That's real promotion for a show, though.  That's great, yeah.  Did Comedy Central do that?  I like the tip of my dick to look like a Maker's Mark bottle.  I can't handle that.  I'll take it if it looks like a dipstick.  I don't mind that.  I don't mind a little oil.  But I can't take the fucking Maker's Mark.  Come on. 
[02:34:30]  Not a shit.  What a great time slot they give you, too, after Tosh.  I mean, it's perfect.  It's like the show is totally different than his, so it's not like two of the same thing.  It's fucking great.  It's a perfect time for it.  Thank you.  That is fucking great.  Can you put me on?  So I have to listen.  I have two friends that put me on.  I'm fucking Team Louie and Amy.  No, you know what?  That's the thing.  I've learned about comedians.  None of us have the capacity to actually be grateful, so I would never put somebody on  the show because I thought that they would actually like me more. 
[02:35:00]  It's only because I want to use your cat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Amy's really learning the showbiz lingo, too.  That was great.  I think you're learning the showbiz lingo.  I've got nothing.  You've got mascots, too.  They've got mascots.  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  Isn't that a finger suit?  Yes.  That's great.  They made a finger suit.  You can't just buy a finger suit.  They had to make that.  I absolutely thought that's what I was going to be doing.  Oh, that's great.  That is great.  Yeah.  Right outside our building, if you want to check it out.  It's out there right now. 
[02:35:30]  48 and 6th or 49, maybe 49.  Is it cold out today?  I feel bad for this person dressed up like the finger.  No, you're kidding me.  The fucking colder, the better.  Right.  Yeah, perfect.  Software.  Exactly.  Go throw water on them.  Exactly.  I'll tell you how cold.  It's probably like in the 40s right now.  We're supposed to go up.  Is that how it is, Amy?  You don't even know if it's cold out anymore.  Yeah.  I flew from Buffalo yesterday.  I haven't been in a city longer than 12 hours for a while.  Yeah.  Buffalo's rough.  Yeah.  How was it up there?  Like, what do you mean?  They like the comedy, though. 
[02:36:00]  Like.  Maybe they do, usually.  How was the gig?  The people were there.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  They were in their seats.  Oh, that's nice.  What happened?  And I didn't say jokes.  I don't know.  No.  I don't know.  Was it not a good one?  Um, it wasn't my favorite show of the tour.  I'll be real.  Oh, man.  And I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But, yeah, I guess I can just be honest about that.  Yeah.  I feel like the shows, the crowds have been so amazing on this tour.  And Buffalo, it was a makeup show. 
[02:36:30]  It was snowed out.  It was a Sunday night.  Oh, okay.  And other excuses I've given myself.  They're all depressed.  Oh, so they're just grumpy at this point.  Yeah.  They're just cranky.  Cranky.  They're like, why are we living on the wall from Game of Thrones?  Cold.  I did open the show in a super aggressive way, though.  I was just like, why do you live here?  Like, I was kind of.  Oh, they probably took a little, they resented that a little bit.  I mean, it's probably, it's probably my problem.  I did it for three years.  It is a rough place to live, man.  It's just like, why?  That window will fucking destroy you.  Now, this one hasn't been a joy down here. 
[02:37:00]  No.  Yeah.  But way easier than living in Buffalo still.  Yeah, I don't imagine.  At least this is New York.  Even though it sucked in New York City, but whatever.  I've had some shows recently that I wasn't happy with.  It's weird.  Like, you think, like, after a certain point, people are coming to see you.  Like, it'll be good.  Yeah, regardless.  And then it's like, a couple shows, you're like, oh, my fucking God.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  They're present, but that's it.  I don't know how you guys do it.  I don't understand how you guys do it either, because it's just beyond me.  I tell the story.  It doesn't feel good.  I'd cry.  I used to go to spots with Jimmy when we had our time off, and in one place, he would  kill it, and then the next place, 15 minutes later, the exact same material that he's trying 
[02:37:30]  to work out, completely bombs.  Oh, in the city here.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's so fucking weird.  But it's the same space.  It's the city.  You would think the people are pretty similar.  They were the same people.  They left.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I brought them in a bus.  I'm like, just pretend you didn't hear this five minutes ago.  But you guys go from...  I know this is where just, you know, and it's been going well, and then just, yeah, that  was...  That's so weird.  And I didn't think your energy was different.  No.  It seemed to me to be the exact same feel.  Do you just walk off stage and you're like, eh, do you forget about it, or does it stick  with you?  But the thing is, those shows where you're like, oh, God, what happened, where you get 
[02:38:00]  the most, like, we had a great time, and you're like, you did?  Because you guys didn't make any noise.  Yeah, you really didn't show that you were having a great time.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, like sleeping with someone who doesn't make any sound when they come, you're like,  they're like, that was amazing.  You're like, oh, you could have at least changed your facial expression.  Well, for me, then I just realized they didn't.  I didn't realize that was fucking Terry Schiavo.  Oh, I thought you might have come quietly.  No, I didn't, Jim, at all, actually.  Oh.  I thought you came quietly.  I want Club Story Kenny to ask a question. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's true.  He jumped up off his seat.  The power couple.  That's right.  That was great.  He was a star season one.  Season one.  Kenny was a star season one.  Kenny was a total star.  Hi.  Kenny, you got a question for Amy Schumer?  No, but I do have a comment.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  Amy, you have a great billboard in Times Square.  I do?  Yeah, big electronic billboard.  Hot mess.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, it's terrific.  Yeah, oh, I didn't know that.  Kenny, are you blushing?  It's huge.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I love Amy. 
[02:39:00]  You're red, though.  You're blushing.  Yeah, you are.  Maybe he's dying.  Trust me, that is the option we're rooting for.  Blushing or dying, we'd all rather see Kenny dead than shine.  Jesus.  I'm happy to see your sister.  Yeah, we're happy to see you.  I haven't seen her since Poughkeepsie.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But you've got to see the billboard.  Wow, we definitely have to see the billboard.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know that was up.  Damn.  Where did I see a hot mess billboard?  I did see it, but it might have been a picture of one.  I saw it on the subway.  I saw a photo of one, too.  When you said hot mess, that was familiar.  Oh, and there was a billboard in L.A. 
[02:39:30]  That was right.  Yeah.  That's great.  Oh, a little billboard in L.A.  Are you scantily clad in it?  No.  I think it's like my face, but I think my tits are probably in the corner.  Yeah, they're really flattering pictures when it says hot, and then it switches to mess,  and she's drinking from a paper bag.  Is that true?  Oh, wow.  That's what it is?  Oh, cool.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I like your suit.  What's going on?  Has he been wearing a suit?  He wears a suit all the time.  He wears a suit here every day.  He looks like an urban act.  Look at the colors he chooses.  I'm an executive, Amy. 
[02:40:00]  Are you?  Very safe colors.  Executive what?  Protection.  Oh, okay.  I can't believe you're allowed out during the day.  Amy, enough about me.  Let's talk about the premiere of your show tonight.  Oh, wow, Kenny.  What are we going to see tonight?  Let's get some business out of the way.  I think James is in the premiere episode.  Yes.  What is Jimmy going to be doing without giving away?  What?  You can't go in there?  Oh, wow.  Oh, you can't go in there.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He's in, I think, one of my favorite scenes of the season.  Oh. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of a period piece, if you will.  It really was.  I like that.  We took a nice photo.  I look like Tootsie.  I mean, I look insanely horrible.  Like Tootsie.  I really do.  Oh, shit.  I'm wearing, like, those big glasses.  I look like Dustin Hoffman.  And you remember, it was noisy that day because of the problems with the, oh, my God, you were  trying to shoot something, and there's, like, the union problems in the next building.  Oh, so loud.  So, no one can shoot.  It's, like, music.  Like, some, like, flamenco.  It was, yeah.  And it was so hot.  And it was fight choreography.  Oh, right. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  I was gone by that.  It's really crazy.  I was wrapped right before you guys had to shoot that.  Playing and showing your support.  Oh, mother.  Cheers.  Later.  Yeah, there was somebody on Amy's staff who I thought was really hot.  Yeah.  And I realized I had no vibe with it.  What's his name?  What's that?  Jonathan, I believe.  It was Jonathan.  I had no shower there because I'm 22 years older than her, so I just went home.  Oh.  Went home in my car.  No, I think that you're older than that.  Yeah, that was a great scene.  And the guy with the mustache was really good, too. 
[02:41:30]  I forget his name, but I know I know him.  Oh, Ollie.  Ollie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ollie Farinaki and Ian.  That's a very funny scene.  Yeah.  That's going to be great tonight.  Glad to see it tonight.  Yeah.  Psyched, I know.  New episodes.  Let's get Amy some numbers tonight.  Please.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the show was a hit last year.  I mean, it was a very successful.  You can just feel when people are talking about something.  Yes, yes.  If they like it.  Yeah, yeah.  You can see it.  People like it.  Yeah.  What about when people come in and promote stuff you know they're not proud of?  I do it every day. 
[02:42:00]  Some guys admit it, which is kind of fun.  It's kind of fun, right?  That they don't like what they're working on?  Yeah, they'll admit it.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of someone recently.  Michael Madsen is always good.  Well, Michael Madsen is the classic example.  He went over all his movies and explained why he did the projects.  Oh, he's like, I wanted a new basement on my house?  Like that kind of stuff?  Yeah, mortgage, child support.  Yeah, all that shit.  It was really funny.  Yeah.  He didn't make a point.  I think you're thinking of the other guy that was the sergeant in Sam's Private Ryan. 
[02:42:30]  He was in Natural Born Killers.  Yeah.  Oh, you think Tom Sizemore?  Oh, Tom Sizemore.  Tom Sizemore.  Why did we always confuse that?  We had Tom in there.  Yeah.  He's crazy, right?  He's fucking batshit.  Yeah, we had him on a couple of times.  The second time was a little bit tense.  A little rough at times.  A little tense between him and Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  A little tension?  We chatted after.  He was very nice.  He was all right.  He was just a little weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was very cool after that.  I think he was on the drugs a while ago, and he said he was all cleaned up. 
[02:43:00]  But in my personal opinion, which holds no water, he seemed to be fucked up.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You can tell.  You can just tell.  Everybody.  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I know.  It's funny.  I'm a bad barometer for that, and I should be a great one.  For people not being sober?  Yeah.  I'm such a fucking optimist.  You want to hope, and I always are.  Do you want to believe?  I really do.  Skipping through life with deuce-colored glasses. 
[02:43:30]  Complete fucking blithering idiot at 45.  I don't know who's drinking and who's not.  I know you can smell it if somebody's been drinking at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  But my dad was a big drinker, so when somebody smells like alcohol, it makes me like, aww.  Like, it's a sentimental feeling.  Yeah.  I'm like, hold me.  And stop there.  How was your father?  He's bad.  Is he bad?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, no.  He's a wreck.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, we're all going to die.  Hey.  No, you're not.  This is supposed to be an accurate view.  Sorry, sorry.  How's your drive to work, everybody?  How's your drive to work?  Hello, everyone.  It really does.  My dad is sick.  And it's getting worse, huh?  It's getting worse.  But it's just, it really, everyone always says it.  But it's just, you know, like the show premiering tonight, I'm so excited and proud of the show.  But it also just lets you know, like, you know, you got no control.  Priorities?  Yeah.  You got your priorities straight?  We're going to go out and watch it with him and just, like, enjoy the shit out of every second. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did Lori kill Martin?  Did you realize she was tweeting when her dad was dying of cancer?  Live tweeting her dad dying.  That was really cool.  But, you know, that's how you deal with it.  It's like you fucking make laughs.  With that Twitter.  With people that go, you're boring.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Don't hurry up.  Yeah, fuck them.  Yeah.  Twitter people.  Do you get a lot of abuse?  Um, some.  Only when I'm on here.  Yeah, that's true.  Okay.  You know what?  It really is just our fans.  Our fans are vicious. 
[02:45:00]  I can see them coming a mile away.  And I love them.  I really do.  They're vicious people.  But they do enjoy you very much.  And they're rotten to us, too, if there's any consolation.  Well, it makes me feel like they love me.  Yeah.  You know, I've had a bad life.  Yeah.  How about the Judd Apatow movie?  Yeah.  What's going on with that?  We started shooting that in May in New York.  Oh, awesome.  Damn.  Very cool.  That's going to be fucking huge.  I read the script.  It's hilarious.  Colin's in it.  I'm not saying that to be polite.  It's hilarious.  Colin's in it, too?  Of course.  He's carrying it, right?  He's my love interest. 
[02:45:30]  You couldn't say just kidding quickly enough.  Sorry.  He's my love interest in real life.  Thin awful hamster.  I love his tweets, man.  You know, he hasn't been tweeting for a couple of weeks.  I know.  He's tweeting today about April Fool's.  Is he?  I tell Colin, I know what you're doing on Twitter, and I still want to choke you with a phone call.  He really is infuriating.  He's fucking...  He's back on Twitter.  What is he saying today?  Right, folks?  I don't know.  Please tell me what he said.  He made me laugh.  I saw that dummy at the cellar the other night. 
[02:46:00]  He made me laugh with something so fucking hard.  On stage or just hanging?  We went for pizza, but I mean, it was on stage.  He really made me laugh.  He had some good lines.  He's so funny, man.  He's talking about make April Fool's.  Leslie, Artie, was wearing this red blazer.  Oh, no.  Artie for quality.  Why would he do that?  Modi had the best line of the night.  We were all trashing his jacket.  Of course.  I was like...  I think I called him a Southwest flight attendant or something.  But Modi was like...  Wait, what did he say it can be?  Like, where are the...  He said, like, he's looking for a fox. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's like, where are you looking for a fox?  Like, it was just...  Modi just won the night.  Colin, here he goes.  Enjoyment, and in parentheses, laughter, is like a fine painting.  And there's a lot of, and in quotes,  forgers out there, exclamation point.  Your, quotes, museum, and in parentheses, heart,  needs to be refurbished.  Somebody needs to just put a plastic bag over his head  and never let go. 
[02:47:00]  Hit him with a hammer.  Somebody stop this, man.  I guess if there's a day to return, it's April Fool's Day.  After all, that's the comedian's day, right, gang?  Fool's Day.  Gang.  Hung gang.  Where was he for two weeks?  He's the worst.  I don't know.  I think, yeah, he made a conscious decision.  He just took a break.  Took a little break.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta take a break.  I wasn't a while.  You went on a vacation.  Oh, my God.  I needed to just back off of fucking Twitter for a while.  Yeah.  Got too heated.  I would get into these eight to ten hour discussions 
[02:47:30]  on fucking everything from race to fucking space.  Right.  Just everything.  And then I'd realize I could be, you know, playing video games.  Yeah.  Something more productive.  Giving back to the universe.  I could really give.  Yes, yes.  Exactly.  I had a thing with a girl recently where I sent something shitty to her  because she wrote something on Salon.  Nothing terrible.  And she snipped something back at me.  So I was like, you're, I'm like, I couldn't, and I'm like, no.  Yeah.  You hit her first.  She hit you back.  You can't formulate this without it being vicious.  And I don't want to be vicious to her. 
[02:48:00]  I was.  Ew.  Because I, no, but I thought of those discussions, nothing.  A, I can't change anybody's mind on a four hour radio show.  I'm not going to do it in 140 characters.  Right.  And it's just going to degenerate into being shitty.  And do I quote exactly and then put a dash?  I know.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Let it go.  Let it go.  You ever try to like, uh, retweet with a comment and you're like, oh, we're 16 characters  in the hole already before I even start.  Always.  And then you start looking like, where could I edit?  And then I just realized what I have to say. 
[02:48:30]  It's not even that important.  Yeah.  What am I sitting here?  Like the edit, like fucking Perry White.  Editing.  Why?  That's from Superman.  He was like the editor.  The black and white version.  Yeah.  That would be a really good, uh, that would be a good radio show.  Somebody, like, where you have to explain all your references.  Yes, all the reference.  Believe me, you're on that radio show.  You're already here.  Hey, we got some of the products.  What?  Bring it in.  Oh, we got finger blasters up here?  I think so.  Oh, shit. 
[02:49:00]  Eric's coming back in studio.  You really have to pick and choose where you, um, put your energy with that stuff.  Because I've gotten upset with a couple bloggers or whatever.  And then I reach out to Jimmy and I think, like, I, I kind of, whatever they are, like,  kind of, you know, freaked out on someone.  And then Jimmy's been like, hey, like, actually, you should call back and apologize.  You were wrong.  And I'm like, oh, shit.  So, yeah.  Wow.  Why is Sam making a face at the, the blasters?  You don't like the blasters?  You eat chicken fingers.  You like the chicken fingers.  Why do you eat chicken fingers all the time? 
[02:49:30]  Where's the, where's the sauce?  They said the sauces weren't ready yet.  What?  What?  That means a guy, that means a guy is standing over a cup right now.  He's stroking his dick.  It looks like a finger, right?  Wow, that's, uh, fucked up.  Yeah, that looks like a French pie, but it's chicken.  Yeah, I'll eat the same.  Chicken, chicken.  Look at that fucking.  Your girls are laughing back there.  The publicity machine is rocking.  They're really good.  They look like they're good.  No.  No, no, no.  They're good.  They're good.  That's one of the upstairs.  Oh, I can't.  I'm getting my body back together. 
[02:50:00]  Aw.  Yeah, you are.  That is a tasty chicken.  That is a good runner.  We need the sauce, though.  No thanks.  Oh, take one.  Hey, stop being a stick in the mud.  Stop being a stick in the mud.  And you blast the chicken finger into the vaginal sauce.  Yeah.  That's cool.  That's great.  I like that.  This is exciting.  This would be a real product.  Yeah.  Somebody reviewed, um.  That's so cool.  One of the reviews for the show have all been really good, but there was one where the  guy was like, he's like, sometimes Schumer's, like, language, you can't even, you don't 
[02:50:30]  even know what she's saying because they bleep it so much.  And, but there's like one scene where that was the joke.  Yeah.  That it was all bleep.  Oh, no.  And so he just missed the joke.  And you're like, should I reach out and be like, no, dude.  Oh, my God.  But you're like, ugh.  No, he's just not even given energy.  You could reach out sometimes.  If you reach out nicely, uh, there's a way to do it.  Because sometimes they do just fuck up.  But you can tell when they're being awful and snarky and shitty.  And you can tell when they're just, you know, they just didn't get something.  Oh, yeah.  He just missed it.  Yeah.  I think this guy has a trigger point for something with this dude. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  So maybe you're right.  All right, Ant.  I'll smile.  Jimmy, too.  Hold on.  Aw.  You gotcha.  I'll focus on Jimmy.  Aw, how adorable.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's such an asshole.  How's my neck look?  It looks gorgeous.  In my Paul McCartney photo, my neck, it looks like someone stacked little tires.  Aw, I should be decapitated.  But you're in shape at that point.  What happened?  Because I went to take a selfie with McCartney.  And then you moved back?  No, but...  You never moved back.  But he goes, no, no, I'll have my guy do it.  He said that.  So I handed it to his guy, but I still stood and saw him. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  Fucking...  Like Esterole.  Oh.  Just a blubber necked silch.  Fucking one of the Beatles, and I look retarded.  Any love?  What do you got going on there, Amy?  Single as fuck.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Fucking A.  I really enjoy Amy's tales.  Oh, man.  I do.  Exactly.  Man, I, like, people, I'm synonymous with anything I've ever said on here.  I know, yeah, yeah.  That taxi story never goes away now.  It's still real fun when I'm in a taxi, when the driver's heard the story. 
[02:52:00]  I'm like, no, I'm not doing that anymore.  I'm past that.  But then I'm like, all right.  What the fuck?  Was Earthquake a guy real?  From Ellen?  Oh, um, no.  Not really.  That was a funny story.  Yeah, thank you.  No, I'm not dating anybody.  Did you actually feel an earthquake?  Yes.  I'd never been in one before.  It's really scary.  Have you been in one?  Little ones.  The tiny ones.  That's like 4.6 or something like that.  Have you been in an earthquake? 
[02:52:30]  No.  It was awful.  He's bummed.  No, I feel like I can't.  Did you ever see the comedian earthquake?  Oh, Jesus.  Was that your first?  Kenny's wearing his suit.  Was that your first earthquake?  Yeah, it was really scary.  Where were you?  In L.A.  No, but I mean where?  Oh, right.  Yeah, no.  Thanks.  The hotel or?  Jersey.  I was at the apartment I'm running and I was in bed alone.  And then that also makes you think like, oh, just like a beam's going to hit my head. 
[02:53:00]  And they'll take you out of there.  Yeah, they're like, oh, she died alone.  How she always was.  Did shit fall over or did you just like start moving?  Everything moves.  No, everything just moves.  It's fucked up.  There have been a lot this week.  I'm like scared to.  There's been a hundred or something over the weekend alone out there?  There were just.  Aftershocks?  Over five point something.  I don't know.  It's just too much.  I wouldn't mind being in a minor one.  Like that one would be kind of cool.  What?  It's scary.  I know, but I want to do it once.  This way, if someone says you've been an earthquake, I'll be like, yeah, it'll have  a good story.  I don't know.  You realize you ain't shit.  Just lie about it.  You realize you ain't shit.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  It's unbelievable.  It's like peak in the ocean.  But then people in California, they can't understand like why people live where there's tornadoes.  And the people in tornadoes can't understand why you live where there's hurricanes.  I'm talking shit about Buffalo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the middle of the lake.  Big snowstorm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The wall from Game of Thrones was a great line of that.  That's hilarious.  Thank you.  That is really funny.  It almost makes it worth it.  To sit in front of those staring faces.  How long into it?  Because I didn't like my shows at the Borgata.  The crowds were really nice.  Nobody heckled.  But casinos are never my favorite gigs, even though the crowds enjoy it. 
[02:54:00]  And they were afterwards.  Yeah.  It's just some of them have lost a lot of money.  They were laughing like they were reading a book.  Yeah.  It's like a chuckle.  They, um, I would say I knew in the first 90 seconds of my set.  Wow.  And I tried.  I really tried to get them and whatever.  And there were a couple moments where it felt like it might go well.  That sounds like sex.  But it sucked because of the book.  I knew in the first 90 seconds.  This isn't going to work out.  Wasn't going to go well.  There were, uh, but like some of the new stuff worked. 
[02:54:30]  And I was like, oh shit, it is me.  But I don't know.  That's the worst.  When you get a big laugh.  When you feel like it's going mediocre the whole time.  And then a huge laugh comes.  You're like, oh God, that is possible for me.  Oh no.  You guys can laugh.  You're just not.  Wow.  You just choose not to.  So weird.  I don't know.  What do you guys go through?  Yeah, you want to take mediocrity the whole set.  Because you can go, that was the maximum I could have gotten.  Their fault.  Yeah, their fault.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you know when, uh.  It feels worse to get that laugh, yeah.  How do you know not to change your, your setup. 
[02:55:00]  Your set.  In general.  Like, you're bombing in Buffalo, let's say.  But then you move on to Cleveland, you kill.  But when does it get to a point where you're like, alright, obviously that joke's not happening.  Yeah, I think just, it's like science just after.  You just figure out it for a while.  Statistically, okay, this joke works.  Yeah.  It works.  I give it six years.  And I open with it, and I close with it every night.  And if it gets no laughs in six years, I consider dropping it.  It sells merchandise.  Yeah, I make it a catchphrase.  You know, where are my muffins?  Eat this, arrow. 
[02:55:30]  You have a pointing up towards my face.  I missed the point.  I've been told that Amy has to go.  Oh.  It's a big promotional day for Amy Schumer.  It certainly is.  There's finger bangers, blasters, finger bangers.  Finger blasters out there.  I didn't say it.  Oh, they didn't say it.  What do you mean?  Travis.  Travis, back me up.  Stop trying to throw you in our studio.  Roland told me a rapparoo.  Roland.  Roland.  We don't listen to Roland.  Uh-oh.  Roland.  Well, maybe, do you have anything else here? 
[02:56:00]  I have one other thing here.  EW.  EW.  Oh, we'll take their time.  That's entertainment weekly.  We got this.  It's a great magazine, I suppose.  We got this.  They could simulcast it.  Yeah, I mean, they'll still be there, right?  Can we make sure it's okay so I can hang here?  Five minutes.  Don't get in trouble.  Five minutes.  No, it's good if they want to help her.  Because for me, you're stupid.  Yeah, they've been very nice to me.  They should be nice to you, too.  Unlike you guys who turn on me.  Just by reading this copy, you're turning on me. 
[02:56:30]  That is some horrible copy, Amy.  It's terrible.  I knew you wouldn't like that.  Like, why?  Jen, please help.  It's so wacky.  It's like, and I go, oh, boy.  It's so embarrassing.  It's not written by somebody that knows how to write good descriptions.  It's just wrong.  It's just not the right way for people to see the show.  It's not like, oh, it's dirty.  Look out.  TV.  You know how I knew Amy's show was going to be funny?  At the premiere, when you were talking to the audience, you said, 
[02:57:00]  and I can't believe Comedy Central let me make this show.  But that meant that you really liked it.  And for a comic to really like, you know, because we're such fucking negative idiots,  it's got to be a really funny show.  I heard your show is hilarious.  Matt's been telling me.  Do you not talk about it?  Well, I haven't mentioned it yet, but it's okay.  I suck.  I suck.  I suck.  Spilling the beans.  I suck.  That's okay.  Nobody knows what I'm saying.  Spilling the beans.  But yeah, no, Coach, he's great.  He's fucking hilarious. 
[02:57:30]  When are we going to see this show, Jimmy?  Sorry.  I'm actually doing it on a GoPro in my living room.  And it's a show called Jimmy Make a Funny, where I just make observations in different characters.  Jimmy Make a Funny.  Jimmy Make a Funny.  Oh, would that be horrible?  It would be a dud.  Oh, breaking news.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, don't be a place.  That's all right.  We could have dumped, but I was kind of happy that you said it.  It's not like anything was said, what it is.  Not exactly.  And believe me, it's not like anyone will hear of it.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:58:00]  After the test shows are shot.  No.  And they're like, wow, have you always blinked that rapidly out of your left eye?  That's uncomfortable for everyone.  Can you only give right profiles or hire someone to play you?  They can slow that down in post.  You'll be all right.  Slow it down a little bit.  But Amy's show tonight is...  Oh, what did you do on Jimmy Fallon?  No.  Don't read this.  It's so embarrassing.  Did you propose to who to show him?  It's so bad.  No.  None of it's true.  It's all lies.  It's so embarrassing.  She's declared herself... 
[02:58:30]  You're proclaiming.  You're making proclamations and declarations.  What?  Oh, Amy.  I'll read it.  You're so mean.  So far, Inside the Machine, we're back for season two on Comedy Central.  That's perfect.  See, that's good.  Amy toured the country doing stand-up, did a couple of Comedy Central rows, and then landed  on a show on Comedy Central.  I don't know when he's being mean, because he gets too excited.  No, but those are all very accurate.  And he gets really serious.  And you have to be biographical.  You have to tell.  All right.  I would hate that as a comedian.  He tries to pull you in, this bastard. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, trust me.  Trust me.  Now here it comes.  Season two.  I'm not even going to be mean.  Season two premieres...  It's equal verbally to a van, and just waving candy in front of you.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Yes, I'm just trying to guess the code word.  It's lemons.  Season two premieres tonight at 10.30, 9.30 Central on Comedy Central.  In the first season, Amy used sketches, stand-up, and in clothes, woman-on-the-street interviews,  which you did. 
[02:59:30]  We all know you're being aggressive.  The shrugs and that's fine.  I'm practicing my acting.  You're such a jerk.  He's doing a good job, I think.  He's doing great.  But we know Amy didn't write this, and it is humiliating for a comedian to read...  Like, I have to approve all bios that go out, because I've read stuff that publicists have  written, and they mean well.  You're still a piece of shit wrong.  I know.  It's supposed to be A-N-T-H-O-N-Y.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is that a waddle?  She had a shorter name.  I know, right?  B-O-B.  You know what, dude? 
[03:00:00]  Why?  It's the sketches I've seen.  I've read through a few of them, because when we rehearsed the sketches, I got to watch  a couple, and they were legitimately fucking funny.  They're really funny, yeah.  Of course.  And this was watching you walk through.  I loved watching you walk through.  This is why I love Amy, because you were walking through the blocking of it in front of all  these people.  And I'm such a shameful idiot, maybe.  But you were really...  Like, this was your fucking gig.  Oh, she's professional.  Yeah, but like somebody who knows what they want and knows who they're doing. 
[03:00:30]  It's almost scary how professional you are.  Oh, it made me sick.  Oh, it's just going to be kind of fun, goof around, and then it's like, wow, she's serious.  Yeah, she'll love this fart toy I have here.  I'm going to make fart sounds during the sketch.  But no, you know exactly what you want, and that's why the show is really, really funny.  So the sketches I saw were great.  Thank you.  Well, the only reason that I got a show is because I started getting a little bit more successful  stand-up, which people are coming to my shows because of you guys having me on here.  Oh, I think it was more of those roasts were very, very advantageous. 
[03:01:00]  If I weren't coming in here, none of this would have happened.  For real.  For real.  All right.  We'll take it.  Just take it.  No way.  I mean it.  Can I read a tweet?  No.  I want to return the compliment.  Scott Miller writes, this is my first tweet, tell Amy to come to Michigan. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, that's nice.  Can I continue?  That's a great, that should be a period, not a semicolon.  Yeah, yeah.  So I could eat her ass.  I will make her come better than a dirty taxi driver.  Oh.  That's nice, too.  That's nice.  That's nice.  See, we're in Michigan.  Yeah, where exactly does he want to eat my ass? 
[03:02:00]  I'm not going to Ann Arbor.  I'll go to Eastland's.  Do we have bad tells?  That guy, you guys are the worst.  You all, your little boys, you just get too excited.  I'm so excited that the bashing is...  We're too old to act this time.  I look down and I try too hard to be official.  Oh, and this part's fine.  Your hand moves like you're giving a speech.  Yes, I do.  Like, yeah, like I'm ignoring...  And Ann Arbor smiles.  I can't wait.  Yes.  You can't.  And Anthony just begins talking.  Yes, that's true.  What is this about?  Anthony just gets nervous, I know.  It just fills up the air with a lot of words. 
[03:02:30]  No, but I always know when Ann's gearing up to be fucking mean, and I know it's going  to be horrible for whoever's directing it, because it's going to be long.  It's going to be...  It's going to be a stretch.  It's built up.  Like, like, with the...  And I love Ralph and May, but when you started with Ralph and May, I was like, oh, no, because  I love the guy, and I knew.  And by the way, like, whenever I hear that, fuck, oh, no, this is going to go until 10.  It was very, yeah.  B-Rock, you were really creepy energy today.  You look like the midget who, like, hung himself in the back of Wizard of Oz. 
[03:03:00]  I was like, you don't want to assume that, like, oh, my God, you look like the midget  who hugged himself and said you're a fat guy who should have.  Oh, wow.  I don't mean that.  I'm sorry, you're right.  I just...  Wow.  I don't mean that.  Finger blasters.  Wow.  I don't mean that.  But you are just leaning by the garbage.  Do you have a big boy shirt under that one?  Under your WrestleMania shirt?  It's purple.  Wait, wasn't it WrestleMania just, like, last night or something?  Coming up.  Oh, this weekend.  This weekend.  Oh.  Me and Jimmy went last year.  I don't know.  How was it?  Boring.  You know, it was... 
[03:03:30]  It bothers Sam, but...  After UFC, it's harder for me.  But we know so many of those guys, and it's just...  I enjoyed it.  Thanks.  You're going to lose him that gig he interviewed for when he said he was sick.  Oh, I know.  We've got to get Amy.  All right.  Yeah, Amy.  Thanks, guys.  Tonight hit the bricks, sweetheart.  It was great seeing you.  No, don't worry about this, Jimmy.  I'll see you.  I promise.  Amy is on tonight.  Comedy Central.  After Tosh.  And it's just fucking great.  I'm really happy.  Premiere of Season 2.  Yes, fantastic.  10.30, 9.30 Central for the Central Time Zone. 
[03:04:00]  Michigan guy.  Yeah, Michigan guy.  Because she has declared herself.  Oh, Nancy.  She's out of here.  I love you guys.  Thanks, Amy.  Thanks, Amy.  I want to thank Amy Schumer for stopping by.  That was a lot of fun.  It's been a while.  We haven't seen her in a bit.  She's a good egg.  Make sure you check out the show tonight.  Please, people.  10.30, Comedy Central, Inside Amy Schumer.  I remember what I said about being legitimately funny, too, because me and Jim Florentine were doing stuff.  So you watched a couple people do their sketches.  Right.  And they were really fucking funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you could. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  After we went to break, and me and Jimmy, I can't do this.  Oh, what?  I just opened our walk into the bathroom.  We were walking down the hall, and I'm going to tell the whole thing.  So we're walking, and also we see, he's listening right now, too, but I don't care.  We see Scott Greenstein.  Oh.  And I quickly go to Jimmy, make believe we're talking about something really important.  We're trying to avoid.  Oh, no.  He's walking right toward us. 
[03:05:00]  And then we're thinking he's going to go in the bathroom.  We're like, oh, fuck.  We'll just go upstairs, right?  But he continues past the bathroom, and he splits right between me and Jimmy, and he  says without looking at us, oh, you guys had a great rant this morning.  And he walked right between us.  And he walked right through us.  Yeah.  He, I describe him as being hot-headed.  Yeah.  He's a fan.  Hot-headed.  Look at Sam.  Why are you shaking?  I'll tell you what it was, but the funny thing about Scott's body language was he had  his arm, he'll always at least stop and go, hey, guys, how you going? 
[03:05:30]  Like, he'll always say hi and be friends.  His arms were by his sides, and he was walking the way you walk when you've just accidentally  murdered somebody.  Accidentally.  He didn't even slow down.  No.  Oh, he was not happy.  His body language is a lot.  So what do you think, let's play a little game, what do you think me and Jimmy did after  that confrontation?  Giggled like chicks?  Yes.  Fuck.  No, it makes perfect sense.  We openly laughed as hard as you could laugh. 
[03:06:00]  And it wasn't fake.  Yeah.  We just found it very tickling and just fucking started laughing in front of all these people.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Jesus.  You had a good rant this morning.  Now, listen to the replay.  What are you going to do?  Nice piss, Arnold.  What are you going to do?  And I meant every word of it.  What are you going to do?  April falls.  That's a false.  Wait.  Huh?  We saw Joe Frazier. 
[03:06:30]  No, he's dead.  April falls.  You do that?  I do this.  That's what I do now.  Oh, no.  Hi, who's this?  Who do you think it is?  It's me.  It's Lady Di.  It's me.  It's Lady Di.  I like your phone calls.  April falls.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  You know, don't worry about the beats in the background.  The what?  The beats in the background.  I don't know what that is.  What are you, backing up?  Badass.  It's April falls day, you know.  What?  I don't know.  It's April falls day.  You know that.  Yeah.  It's your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you very much.  Happy birthday.  Oh, it's your birthday, huh?  Thank you.  How many natty ices have you had for your birthday?  So far, six.  We all do the same thing. 
[03:07:30]  We look at the clock every time.  We look at the clock immediately and do the math.  I'm looking at the clock immediately.  I'm just telling you.  So far, six.  She is getting more belligerent by the fucking appearance.  We weren't talking about you.  Every appearance, she gets more belligerent.  We didn't say we...  Why do you?  I didn't have anything.  We didn't say you were looking at the clock.  No, we said we look at the clock every time you say how many beers you've had.  Right, because we want to see how early...  All right, you just talked.  Oh, my God.  Keep babbling.  Go ahead.  All right, no.  You're very pretty.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, thank you.  April Files. 
[03:08:00]  April Files.  Yes.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Okay, last time we talked to you, you got mugged.  Yeah, well...  And...  No, no, no.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  And...  And...  And...  Go ahead, I died.  And...  And...  And...  Go ahead, I died.  And...  Littering and...  And...  Littering and...  And...  Littering and...  Can I add my and?  Go ahead, I died. 
[03:08:30]  And you know I'm not going to go to the chicken place anymore, that's for sure.  I wanted...  I don't think she snuck that in.  I wanted to apologize to you, which is very rare.  April Files.  No.  Oh.  We probably shouldn't have...  We probably shouldn't have read some of that stuff about you.  Well, what...  You didn't do anything wrong.  Exactly.  Oh, well, I...  Well, the audience thought so.  And I think they might have been right on that one.  Yeah?  I apologize.  What exactly...  Okay, but what...  It was brought to our attention, and a bunch of people were talking about it, so then I... 
[03:09:00]  I...  Really?  Yeah, it was like, you know, some...  Oh, don't worry about it, guys.  Please.  Some financial issues you were having.  Oh, how were you?  That might have went too far.  I don't know.  But it seems like you weren't bothered by that, so...  Okay.  So then the people on Twitter could go fuck themselves.  All right.  I don't apologize.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying...  Oh, what?  You know, you don't have to worry about all that stuff, because, you know, stuff like  this happens.  At least I wasn't badly hurt.  You know what I mean?  Knock on wood.  She's not even...  I don't know.  She's talking about the mugging. 
[03:09:30]  Well, I...  Didn't even hear what you're saying.  I know.  I apologize.  Hopefully it sinks in somewhere.  I don't know.  Anyway, about the mugging.  Yeah.  I heard a rumor that you got your license back.  That's by my house.  Yeah, I did.  Somebody mailed it to me.  Bus crash in Roslyn Heights.  Oh, what happened there?  No one mailed me my driver's license back.  Is that...  Yeah.  Is that by the school?  I think so.  I know where that is.  Look!  I could read you the note right now.  UFOs in Roslyn Heights. 
[03:10:00]  No.  Everyone all right in that bus crash?  I don't know.  Amy Stewart, by the way, she sounded good.  I heard her.  I was on hold.  She just continues.  I don't know.  Plows right through.  Plows.  Lady died.  Guy died.  Right.  Did you get your license back?  Yes, I did.  How does that happen?  Somebody mailed it to me.  They found it on the sidewalk.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, there you go.  See, that's what makes me suspicious that she might have been there to do other things. 
[03:10:30]  And then she had to come up with an excuse, and then she hid her license.  This is my inner dialogue.  I'm doing time.  They did not mail me back my pocketbook.  They mail me back my driver's license.  You know what I mean?  Like, all right, well, all my money's gone because I had to do this.  But I'm not in person.  All right, so I'll say that I got mugged.  Here's the letter that came.  But I don't want to, like, throw my license away, so I'll hide my license for a little  while, and then it'll magically appear in the mailbox.  She's a puggy.  Believe it or not, it happened before.  So let me see.  What, you got mugged before?  What happened before?  Yeah, I did. 
[03:11:00]  I got mugged before.  You're just such a target.  My license was found in the street.  That's what the book says.  What?  It says found in the street.  Okay, I believe you.  All right, now, you got to believe it.  I was going with a little conspiracy theory, but you proved me wrong immediately.  That's fine.  Well, no, no, no.  I mean, it's not the first time that this ever happened.  No, he's been wrong before.  Thanks, Jimmy. 
[03:11:30]  What kind of muggings have you had in the past?  A long time ago, back in the 80s, I was on Ferlingheisen Avenue in Newark, and I got  mugged, okay, you know, and I was out, like, maybe about 12 o'clock at night or something  like that.  What did the guy look like?  My car broke down.  What did the guy look like?  What did the guy look like?  He was...  It was a bunch of guys.  It was not only one guy.  What did they look like?  Cow herders. 
[03:12:00]  What did they look like?  All right, now.  What did they look like?  They looked like a bunch of black guys.  Oh, okay.  Just checking.  A bunch of black guys.  Just checking.  I don't even know why I was there.  I mean, I don't know why I was there.  You were there to get some black dick.  I walked out over there, and I walked out, and my whole pocketbook got mugged, but the whole  thing is...  Your pocketbook got mugged.  Yeah.  Believe it or not, I lost my wallet, pocketbook a number of times, especially back in the 80s.  We believe it. 
[03:12:30]  They took your personal book?  They took my pocketbook, but the whole thing is, I already had all my credentials in my  pocket.  Why?  My money.  Why?  All right, so I had...  What did you have in your personal book?  What?  I had my pocketbook?  Pocketbook?  Who cares?  Shut up.  Why were you getting mugged a lot in the 80s?  Yeah, exactly.  Why were you carrying a personal book in Tibet?  Because I was a dumb-dumb back then.  Oh, back then.  Back then. 
[03:13:00]  Right.  You know, I mean...  Passion of Eddie back then.  I don't remember why I was going down Stollingheisen Avenue in the first place.  You know...  Swallowed.  I had no idea why I was going down there at that time of night.  Yeah.  I was single back then, and, you know, I decided to go for a ride, and that's...  That's the place I decided to go for a ride.  What are you doing for your birthday tonight?  I don't know.  It depends on Bill.  What?  Bill's got a fucking...  Whether you're going to get fucked in the mouth or backside? 
[03:13:30]  Huh?  Wait, so today's your birthday?  Yes, it is.  Oh.  It's my birthday, too.  Oh.  April Fool's.  No.  April Fool's.  Oh, she spoiled it.  Yeah, she wrecked it on you.  But anyway, I got everything back.  My credentials and all that other good stuff.  I got everything back.  Credentials?  What are you...  FBI?  My creds.  What do you got?  Exactly.  License.  I want your gun in your liver.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Your dumb fucking license that you shouldn't have, your drunk driver. 
[03:14:00]  You think she's a bad driver?  Oh, she's a horrid drunk driver.  It's terrible.  No, no, no, no, no.  I have to...  Wait, hold on.  My landlord is here.  Oh, the lord of the land.  What happened?  Bill!  What does he want?  Rent?  Greg is here.  What do you got to do?  Suck his dick?  Yeah.  Pay another month?  They both have to go underneath four knee pads.  One works the balls, one works the shaft.  Paying rent for Greg.  No, but anyway...  I thought that was real.  Like I was saying, I got everything back just about... 
[03:14:30]  You know, when I got my driver's license, I had to renew what you call it, my registration.  Oh, yeah.  Good, good.  My registration.  No, the truck.  I had to go and renew it.  Yeah.  Because...  Why do we give a flying fuck about this?  I'm curious.  I don't know.  I'm just trying to explain something.  No, no.  Why are you trying to explain to us about re-registering your fucking truck?  Please explain to me that.  Why you're even explaining it to us, Lady Di. 
[03:15:00]  First of all, I had no money to do it, okay, because my car was stolen.  Right.  And then she just goes right on with it.  Right.  Lady Di, I really think you're retarded.  I think there's something...  I think your mind is so fucked up.  I am retarded.  Yeah.  I mean, for this whole thing that's going on, which was not called for...  Happy birthday, Di.  Thank you, Sam.  Oh, Christ, Sam.  It's my birthday, too.  Can we go home?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  What?  I'm going to stay for the actor's show. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, perfect.  Today would be the perfect day to do that.  What are you going to do?  A revelation about how you were a fucking astronaut, too?  You goddamn holdout motherfucker.  You forgot the whole Navy story all those years.  Bob Levy...  She was an astronaut.  Bob Levy.  What did Bob Levy say?  He took his Chevy to the Bob Levy.  I was going to go with Levy Brakes.  Her pussy is dry.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bob Levy told me...  What?  Bob Levy told me to call the show today.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, we have him to thank.  Is that reasonable? 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Then what happened?  I'm just trying to explain.  Then what happened?  Oh, no.  All right.  Bob Levy told me to call the show today.  Then what happened?  And he told me to ask you, Anthony, if you would take me out for a birthday dinner.  What the fuck are you crazy?  Anthony, I'll take you out with a fucking 38.  Yeah.  Like they took out Candy's dog in a bice and men.  Or maybe he'll take you out and put you on your hands and put a feed bag on you. 
[03:16:30]  Jesus.  Why, Jim?  It was just mean.  Oh, whatever.  It's true, though.  You know what?  I said, I'll try, but I don't...  Die.  Hey, lady, die.  Guess what?  Yes.  Anthony's blushing right now.  You can't see it, but he is blushing.  It's true.  Oh.  Blushing?  Is that another word for vomiting?  No.  I don't know.  What's the thought?  What do you think, Anthony?  What?  Yeah, that ain't gonna happen, Die.  You wouldn't take reference? 
[03:17:00]  Sorry about that.  Die, do you think Anthony would get lucky at the end of the date?  Well, will we get lucky at the end of the date?  Do you think he would?  Yes.  Would you give it up?  Me?  Yeah.  Well, I would, if he's willing.  Would you give up the snot hole?  Yeah, that's a great question.  Would you give up where the doo-doo pops out?  If this fucking...  If this door is rocking, don't come knocking.  We'll call it an 80s throwback.  Yeah.  Would you fucking...  I would. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I would.  I would.  God.  She'd let you.  My dick wouldn't forgive me.  She would let you.  Well, I don't know.  Your dick will be just fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I bet you'll milk it really good.  Yeah, sure I would.  I'll be such an indicator now.  God, the thought of it.  It turns out, right?  Stop.  It turns out, right?  Hot, right?  Yeah, real fucking hot.  All right, I'm going home.  God.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, I'm sorry, Opie.  This body isn't going to fix itself. 
[03:18:00]  I've got to get to the trainer.  Right.  Oh, okay.  That's it.  You know how that is, Di, right?  I got you.  When he says trainer, but you say, you know, chicken joint.  Elephant trainer.  Leave me on the line.  I want to talk to Sam.  Oh, leave me on the line?  Oh, okay.  Sure, no problem.  Leave me on the line.  Let's see.  I'll leave you on the line.  Okay.  There you go.  I enjoy.  Oh, Lady Di.  All right, Sam, we leave you this mess.  Well, well, we have a guest host today.  Who?  Who? 
[03:18:30]  Dennis Falcone.  Oh, Danny.  Why today?  I've got places to be.  Oh, come on.  You really got to go somewhere?  Are you kidding?  No.  Where are you going?  Uh-oh.  There's a press conference I have to attend.  All right.  Uh-oh, WWE is calling.  We've got a special guest on the line.  Hi, who's this?  Hi.  Take it, Dennis.  Hello?  It's Danny.  Danny Falcone.  Who's the special guest?  I'll bring my own cans.  The phone crap down.  For real.  I don't want to use someone else's cans.  Oh, wait.  Special guest is there. 
[03:19:00]  Hello?  What is this?  I'm the president.  The president?  That was fine.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony show is drawn to a close.  Stay tuned. </pre>
