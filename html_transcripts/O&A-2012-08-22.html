<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the usual crude humor and banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, including fart jokes and sexually suggestive comments.  They lamented a missing audio clip of children reacting to a "leafy kid" in a movie and dealt with technical audio issues.  Norton discussed his recent *Tonight Show* appearance, highlighting the use of his theme song, and a funny scene from *Louie*.  He also detailed his complex sleep apnea diagnosis and upcoming sleep study, punctuated by a humorous listener call sharing similar experiences.

A significant portion of the show revolved around intern Rob and his planned, poorly executed, 6 o'clock surprise bit.  The hosts expressed frustration and uncertainty about the delay. Rob's bit involved a pig costume (meant to represent producer E-Rock), throwing Monopoly money, and handing out Egg McMuffins. This was largely received negatively by the hosts and E-Rock, leading to discussions about Rob's potential firing.  The segment also included a discussion of a NYC subway explosion and complaints about inconsiderate drivers, particularly those of Asian descent.

Further details on Rob's ill-conceived actions emerged, including a poorly organized pool party and exaggerated claims of golfing prowess (a seven handicap).  Sal, another staff member, offered occasional comments.  E-Rock's failure to reprimand Rob became a recurring theme, along with the repeated removal of Rob's pig nose. Despite the initial conflict, the segment surprisingly ended with Opie and Rob planning a golf outing together.  The entire segment was characterized by profanity and vulgarity.

Rob's antics continued with a fabricated story about the pool party, leading to a surprisingly good-natured phone call with his father, John. This transitioned into a discussion of golf, a $1000 bet between Opie and Rob, and more vulgar and sexually suggestive humor.  E-Rock was repeatedly targeted with offensive jokes, eventually seemingly leaving the studio.  Discussions about the interns' performance, including Sal, and a poorly made song parody by Red Peters followed.  Dan Soder, a guest comedian, joined the show, contributing to the already raucous atmosphere.  Personal anecdotes about Rob's manager, his father's alcoholism and death, and their shared experiences as comics were also shared.

Soder's appearance included sharing difficult personal experiences: his father's death, his mother's subsequent relationship, and his half-sister's death.  The conversation branched into discussions about STIs, Soder's experiences in New York's alt comedy scene, and an anecdote about soiling his pants while dog-sitting.  Impersonations of professional wrestlers (Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, and Andre the Giant) along with discussions of their lives and deaths, including Miss Elizabeth's death, ensued.  The hosts reminisced about their time at K-Rock, mentioning colleagues like Tracy Clority and censorship issues at CBS.  They also acknowledged the 10th anniversary of their firing from WNEW,  discussed the lack of prepared anniversary material, and searched for appropriate audio clips.  A running gag about Warren Sapp's whereabouts and a digression into disturbing animal videos were also featured.

The tenth-anniversary discussion of their firing, sparked by the St. Patrick's Cathedral sex stunt, opened with unrelated news stories before pivoting to their firing.  A heavily edited clip of an interview with Bill O'Reilly highlighted the focus on the show's sexual content.  The hosts' frustration with O'Reilly's framing and the editing was evident.  E-Rock's failure to provide anniversary clips was a running gag, leading to a humorous back-and-forth with the hosts and staff.  A guest, Iraq, ranked their anger towards various staff and guests, including the hosts.  Discussions about a "Tag in the Dark" game and speculation about future guest appearances (Warren Sapp and Dan Soder) occurred.  The show concluded with a "What Did You Learn Today?" segment featuring staff and caller takeaways.  Profane language was heavily used throughout.

A later segment centered on the conflict between Rob and Eric.  Rob's retaliation for a previous on-air reprimand involved Egg McMuffins, the pig costume, and throwing Monopoly money. The hosts, staff (including Troy and Sal), and callers debated the justification, humor, or insubordination of Rob's actions.   The debate extended to ranking past interns, with Rob's performance that day frequently referenced.  The discussion also briefly touched on other past show events and conflicts, including mentions of "Jocktober."  The entire segment, like much of the broadcast, was filled with offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and I, every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rat down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm not gonna tell them live. 
[00:02:00]  E-Rock.  Fuck it, I'll tell them live.  Why did you take away the audio clip of the two kids losing their minds over that movie?  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, comment.  I didn't see a clip of two kids losing their minds over the movie.  Oh, boy.  It was here yesterday.  It's not here today.  That movie with the leafy kid.  Yeah, the leafy kid.  That leafy garden kid.  No, I didn't touch that.  Oh, boy. 
[00:02:30]  Well, somebody did.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  I believe him.  He's never touched anything leafy from a garden.  You got some bass in your ears this morning?  A little bit.  Yeah, what's that about?  A little bit.  Yo, Mars!  Yo, Mars!  I don't know.  Does Mars still work here?  He's in here.  He's coming.  In the Everett Road.  Mars, we got some bass happening.  Jimmy, you got some bass in your ears?  No, no more than normal, but it's a little different today.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm underwater.  A little different today, Mars.  What do we got going on? 
[00:03:00]  Ah, Mars.  Maybe I got my fall allergies kicking in.  I turned my volume up.  It sounds better.  Really?  Yeah, I think my volume is just too far down.  No, something's going on.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Mine's okay now.  If you could just take a look at it during the first break, that would be very nice.  Absolutely.  Jimmy Fallon gave Jim Norton some baked goods.  That was part of the, in the dressing room, that was the baked goods by Melissa.  Those mini, they're fucking amazing.  Really?  What are they?  I'm so disgusted with myself after going to the doctor yesterday physically. 
[00:03:30]  Like, weight-wise, I'm not eating any more bad shit, but I had to have two of those  little, they're like those little teeny, teeny.  I'm not eating any bad shit, but I had.  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  I had.  I love Jimmy.  But I had.  I love how Jimmy gets at these treats.  Those are good, man.  You're tortured by treats.  Oh, he loves a good treat.  You're tortured by treats.  These are the greatest thing on earth.  What are they?  Mini cupcakes?  What are they?  You don't have baked goods by Melissa?  No, I don't know what that's about.  Dude, they're amazing fucking mini cupcakes, right?  I wasn't going to do anything with them.  They look beautiful, but are they annoying? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, sorry.  Did you go old school on that?  Eh, a little bit.  A little bit?  A little bit.  And I'm embarrassed.  I had to be pointed out to me on Twitter that when I came out, fucking, uh...  I haven't seen it yet.  I haven't either.  It was on too late.  I got it all DVR'd and ready to go today.  But I didn't even notice it in the moment.  The Roots played We're Back.  Yes.  I had no...  We're Back.  I didn't even realize it while it was happening.  And better than ever, we're back.  What?  It's Jimmy's tune, man. 
[00:04:30]  Why not?  I didn't realize it.  Springsteen comes out.  They play a fucking Springsteen song.  Fucking anybody comes out.  It's your tune.  Are you kidding?  They play your song.  You know, in the moment, I didn't realize it because you just like, all right, which  way?  I hadn't done the show.  I was like, where's the desk?  Do I go to the right?  You want to be trying to get your logistics.  And I just wasn't...  Because Tyra Banks didn't stay.  Usually the guest stays, but I guess she has to go.  Oh, she heard you were there.  Oh, yeah.  I don't blame her.  But that was what I was thinking of when I walked out.  I wasn't thinking of...  Wow, they got to be big fans of the show if they're coming up with We're Back. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I couldn't believe when I got home.  Do you have that?  I don't want to watch, but I just want to hear the opening intro.  How was Jimmy, man?  Was he good?  How'd you like your set?  It was okay.  I mean, people on Twitter responded more positively than I would have thought.  Really?  What's that?  I never think I do well on these, and I never like to watch them.  Oh, Jimmy.  I didn't watch.  No, I won't either.  I just heard the fat fuck I look like.  But Jimmy is a great...  Oh, yeah, I'm disgusting.  But Jimmy is really great, though.  He's a fucking nice guy, man.  He's solid, man. 
[00:05:30]  Jimmy Fallon is solid.  Yeah, just get the intro.  Get the opening music, because I would like to hear it for the first time.  I can't believe I missed that.  That's hilarious.  They fucking played We're Back.  That's hilarious.  And I'm looking at Twitter, and everybody's like, they played We're Back.  I'm like, really?  I didn't really have it.  We're Back.  You got that, or you just got it when it comes to the couch?  Yeah, they're getting it in the back.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Sam Roberts.  You're welcome.  Wait, why am I hearing you through that mic?  Are you over here now?  I'm over here.  I'm over here now.  There you go.  What I did see was you on Louie. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, the...  The poker scene.  Oh, okay.  Another great episode from Louie.  I'm a little behind.  Well, no, I finally caught up last night.  Oh, okay.  I was too behind, and I finally caught up.  The beginning of that episode is the one where his daughter's playing the violin.  Hilarious.  That is so fucking funny and unexpected.  Hilarious.  And she's really playing.  And you see that look on her face.  She's like, she's got like that, like, she's really trying hard and playing very well for  a kid.  Very well for a kid.  Very well for anyone.  For anybody.  For anybody.  You're right. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, she wasn't playing shitty at all.  No, no.  It went really good.  And the brilliance of Louie, he set that up where the lighting and everything was perfect.  It was so fucking good.  Wow, you're really watching something nice.  Yeah.  And you're watching someone with this talent.  It was so good.  It was the last thing you expect, because you know Louie's a good parent.  Right.  But that would be something that would make sense as a parent.  Sure.  Because she's playing so well, and he just walks in the room and goes, knock it off!  Not now!  Not now! 
[00:07:00]  Really, really good scene.  Because you instantly look and go, why is he doing that?  She's like, but she's got other things to do.  She's supposed to be doing something else at the time.  I just assume parents only did that when the playing was shitty.  Right.  Yeah, it's not time for that now.  Not time for that now.  That's right.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, man.  That show is just so fucking good.  Where are we?  So good.  Bless you, Jimmy Norton.  Bless you, Jimmy. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, bless you again, little Jimmy Norton.  I have to go back for another sleep study.  What?  Why?  Just sleep.  You're like a fucking amazing case.  I think you just need to...  I have complex sleep apnea they told me yesterday.  Complex?  What does that mean?  It's a combination of obstructive, which is your throat and your tongue collapsing or  whatever, and central, which is when your brain just doesn't tell you to breathe.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Just doesn't do it.  So how do you fix that?  There's a certain mask you can get, a certain machine. 
[00:08:00]  Another mask.  Well, it's a machine.  The mask is...  The machine has to be different.  Oh, my God.  It's exhausting.  Dude, it's endless.  It's endless.  Oh, another machine.  Yeah.  To the machine I had...  But are they telling you, you know, good news, this machine will do the trick?  Well, I have to go for the study to have it, what they call titration done again.  Titration.  But this is with...  I had CPAP already, and now I have to go for tri-BiPAP in this ASV machine.  Goodness.  And they fucking...  Are they just hammering you for some money? 
[00:08:30]  No.  No, no, no.  I actually...  I talked to this...  Some of these doctors, I'm suspicious of, man.  They're terrible.  This guy yesterday I talked to for an hour.  He sat with me for an hour, and he goes...  What happened was they looked at my results, and my obstructive was getting better from  the machine in the test.  Like, it was clearing my airway, and then my central was getting worse.  Like, the better my fucking breathing got, the more my brain just kept forgetting to  say breathe.  It was fucking...  Oh.  But the one that...  The machine that fixes both of those.  But that's rare.  He goes, it's only like 15% of the people have what you have.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it?  Why wouldn't it be the rare case? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, my God.  You're the rare case.  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't I be?  Of course.  No one wants to be the rare case.  No.  Well, we haven't seen this a lot.  We haven't seen a lot of this right here.  We want to do a whole show on rare cases.  Oh, no.  Any people out there have the rare case?  Dude, you never want to see the rare case.  You wouldn't want...  Oh, I'd get all woozy.  Would you?  Yeah.  I hate rare cases.  Yeah, but we do that from time to time.  What the hell is that?  I think it might be time for another What the Hell is That?  Poor Jimmy Norton.  It's frustrating.  It's got to be.  It's frustrating. 
[00:09:30]  Jesus.  You should have a treat.  You should have a treat just to relax a little bit.  No, I had two little minis.  That's all I want.  I'm so fucking annoyed with my body.  I'm not eating anything.  No more carbs.  Why are you annoyed with your body?  Because I'm out of shape.  And I'm fucking disgusted.  It's okay.  I'll live.  I should be.  I should be disgusted.  Oh, God.  I'm sad now.  Why?  I had a revelation.  It's like, I'm sad now.  What?  We want you to be happy.  I'm not unhappy.  I'm just. 
[00:10:00]  Do you want to take a call from Jeff in Indiana?  Sure.  Oh, God.  It's not a positive call, sir.  That's why you're going to it.  Let's talk to him.  Oh, God.  First day on the fucking rodeo?  It's not my first day at the rodeo, boys.  We could take a positive call, though, too.  No, no, no.  HIV.  But those tend to be a little boring.  That's all.  Jeff in Indiana.  Jeff in Indiana.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yes, Jeff.  I got that BiPAP machine. 
[00:10:30]  It's a nightmare.  When you put the mask on, it blows you up like the Macy's Day parade balloon.  Oh, boy.  Your ears pop.  Your head swells.  And then when you wake up in the morning, you get to fart for about 15 minutes straight.  You know, I've done CPAP, so I know the machine.  It's the similar reaction.  It blows air down.  I cut a lot of gassers off CPAP because it's forcing air down your throat.  Oh, my God.  You've got to put another one over your asshole so it pushes it back up so you burp. 
[00:11:00]  At least you might have to get those filter underpants.  Remember the filter underpants to keep the farts smell down.  Oh.  All right, Jeff.  Well, I didn't know that.  Yes, I didn't either until I did it.  What blows up?  Your whole body?  Just the air.  No, I didn't swell up.  Just put the air as being forced down.  Does your belly get a little bloated?  You don't feel bloaty?  Nah.  Bloaty.  No.  There's got to be a better way to figure out the sleep apnea, I'm thinking.  I hope so.  Is there an operation you could get or something?  No, not for central. 
[00:11:30]  Not for central.  No.  That's your brain.  That's actually the heart.  It's either congestive heart failure or it's the brain.  Because when your heart is failing, certain levels drop in your system, and then your brain,  instead of focusing on breathing, focuses on that.  That's one of the things that could be...  But you had your heart checked out?  Yes, I went fine.  We went to the same lady, the out-of-shape lady, telling me my heart's okay.  I wanted to tell her, well, I don't think yours is.  How are you an out-of-shape heart lady? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, she's a big woman.  How is that?  Why would you do that?  She's telling me what's going on.  I'm like, really?  Let's put you on the fucking machine.  She's a big gal.  She is, right?  Yeah, she's a big gal.  Jeez Louise.  That's fucking frustrating.  So I had to do...  I've never taken an Ambien before, because I'm an addict.  I can't take that shit.  Yeah.  But I asked for a prescription for one for this new sleep study when I go back. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, so you just take one.  Yeah, I just have to be able to sleep.  Oh, boy.  Fucking Frankenstein wires on me.  So you're doing another sleep study this weekend?  Sunday.  With one Ambien, huh?  I've heard stories about those things.  What have you heard?  Ah, that they just make people fucking hallucinate.  Oh, you know, I've heard bad shit, too, but I...  Walk around, cook things, burn houses down.  I'm going to go, like, with no sleep at all.  Yeah.  I'm just doing it to get through this study.  I want to sleep, because when you sleep, they can fucking adjust the mask and the pressure,  and then by the time you wake up, they usually have it fucking figured out. 
[00:13:00]  This is what you need to do with this machine.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like magic.  My David figured it out.  Here's your intro from Jimmy Fallon.  I can't believe I missed this.  You know our next guest from the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM and his correspondent work  for The Tonight Show.  He also writes best-selling comedy books and is a hilarious stand-up.  Please welcome the very funny Jim Norton, everybody.  We're back, better than ever. 
[00:13:30]  Don't let me stay, don't let me stay the same.  We're back.  What the hell?  We're back and better than ever.  Thank you for coming to visit our show.  I'm a fan, obviously, of your radio show.  I see you on Opie and Anthony in the morning.  Where did Tyra go?  You don't even acknowledge.  How did you not?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it at all.  It was a weird thing.  They're reworking a made-up song.  How cool is that of Jimmy Fallon? 
[00:14:00]  The roots are great, man.  The roots are amazing.  But you don't hear it in that moment because you know the music's going to be playing.  When I looked back on it, I'm like, oh yeah, they were, but it didn't register that it  was mine because you're so focused on.  I walked out and didn't see Tyra Banks there and didn't know she was.  It was just a weird, you know.  I didn't realize they were going to do the vocals, too.  So I thought it would just be kind of an instrumental thing that you recognized.  We're back.  They're singing it.  Yeah, I couldn't believe it when I actually was, I realized I had missed that. 
[00:14:30]  I'm so pissed at myself.  But those guys did it.  Everyone there was just nice.  Yeah, very cool.  They were all nice people.  So it was good.  Oh, goody.  Very cool.  Fat fuck.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  Now I'll be like, oh, Jimmy.  No, I'm afraid you didn't say that.  You don't have to.  I just want my egg whites.  I just want my egg whites.  Fuck you guys.  A little oatmeal.  Thank you, guy.  Some egg whites. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You see how fucking fat I'm getting?  My belt was open.  I didn't even notice it.  I didn't notice that I hadn't done my belt.  Oh, James.  Yeah, but look at all those notches you have to pull.  You're not fat.  That's true.  You got some fucking.  You got a few extra holes there.  You got a few.  You're not on that last one.  That's got to be.  Like that last hole where it's just.  It doesn't even.  The end of the belt doesn't even slip back in that little loop where the extra stuff goes.  How about when you have to make an extra hole? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  With some primitive tools from your house.  Like a steak knife.  Well, it depends on which direction it's in.  Depends on where in the belt it is.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're doing great and you have to pull it all the way.  Oh, look, an extra hole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you want to comment on this?  Comment, E-Rock, comment.  I've had to add leather onto the belt.  He wears two belts connected to each other.  Oh, great.  Now it's going to be fucking pile on the fat kid.  Oh, no.  He's not even that fat. 
[00:16:00]  That's the weirdest thing about all of it.  He's not skinny, though.  He's not skinny, though?  He's not skinny.  Yeah.  Really kind of.  He's E-Rock.  He is.  He's always been E-Rock.  He'll always be E-Rock.  Yeah, but he used to be thinner.  Yeah, well.  A little thinner.  Bedroom eyes.  Slimmer.  I'm distracted because supposedly Rob wants to come in here or something.  His bit's not ready yet.  What do you mean his bit?  A bit.  A bit.  What bit.  Rob is the pool party kid.  Yeah.  And he...  I guess he feels like he wants to own the fucking six o'clock hour. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I guess that's...  It's his now.  I'm very distracted.  I can't move on until I know what the fuck this is about.  He wants to come in here and do something?  Yeah.  I can't take...  It's his last week of his internship and he wants to go out in a bag or something?  What is he doing?  He wanted to make an impact.  He didn't like the way Monday's show went.  And so, you know...  The pool party show was amazing.  Yeah, but he thought he looked like a sociopathic asshole.  Oh, right?  Yeah, but we don't give a fuck about that part of it.  When you are.  Exactly.  He's a very strange dude.  How did he go uncovered for so long? 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  Or covered?  Uncovered?  How did we...  Uncovered.  It took a long time for us to uncover his psychosis.  Yeah, but now he said that, you know, he wants to make an impact in his last week.  He wants to really leave on a different note than that.  And so he came to me.  I did not suggest any of this to him.  And Travis, as my witness, he walked into my office and he proposes,  his idea for a bit yesterday. 
[00:17:30]  And I said, that's what you want to do?  He said, yeah, yeah.  I said, all right.  I'll tell the guys that you have something prepared for the six o'clock hour.  Who knows about this?  Because I don't.  Ant doesn't.  I do.  Travis does.  Danny does.  Are we going to be mad?  Are we going to be happy?  What's up?  I ain't got no clue.  Because I don't trust you at all.  You won't be mad.  You will throw us in shitty situations.  I will do that, yes.  But he does.  Yeah, it's fun for me.  But you won't be mad.  You might be creeped out.  And as I told you before we went on the show. 
[00:18:00]  I don't need to be more creeped out by the guy.  You got to be careful when you do it,  because it will completely stop any momentum that the show has.  It'll just jam on the brakes.  When will it be ready?  He said 6.30-ish at 6.30 now, but I know that it's not ready yet.  I don't like this idea of us now, again,  much like I had to wait for information about the party.  I'm sitting here again waiting on him.  Yeah.  That is true.  This is very...  He really thinks who the fuck he is, doesn't he?  I don't like this at all. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  No, I'm very distracted waiting for this to happen now.  Because you also know that you can't sink your teeth into anything real for the show,  because as I said, this bit will, whatever you do, stop the momentum of it.  Well, we have to now.  Yeah.  Well, of course we have to now.  I'm going to derail.  The only thing it won't stop the momentum of is the conversation of how the momentum  will stop.  Uh-huh.  I know Sam puts you guys in a lot of shitty situations, like you said. 
[00:19:00]  Every time he talks.  A whole fucking 10 o'clock hour.  Because he's an asshole.  Well, yeah, because he's definitely an asshole.  Any positive?  No.  Okay.  Nope, not today.  You're very good at putting them in shitty situations.  Thank you very much.  Not today, asshole.  Oh, boy.  But yeah, you're just going to look at this and have nothing to say.  Nothing?  I don't think.  I think that might be accurate.  Yeah.  I don't think.  Wow.  You'd just be like, what?  Yeah.  Like, that's what you go, we don't need help fucking up our show.  You'll go like this.  Why would we purposely fuck it up? 
[00:19:30]  Here's what you're going to say.  You're going to say, go to break.  Really?  Oh, nice.  I want to comment on whatever this kid is putting together.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Oh, I'm sure it's good.  Oh, God.  Why is it taking so long?  Well, it involves a little bit of preparation.  Yeah, there's a lot of elements to it.  He had to.  Is there going to be a costume?  I'm not going to tell you.  That means there's going to be a costume.  Yeah, he did.  He had to leave the building.  He's not currently in the building.  Wow.  But there's going to be a costume.  I'm not going to tell you. 
[00:20:00]  But Travis, will you please back me up?  And I did not put him up.  Sam has absolutely nothing to do with this.  I have nothing to do with it.  Danny has nothing to do with it.  He just came to you guys?  Yes.  He just walked into our office.  Our office.  I don't like you saying that.  Well.  All right.  You know.  Fair enough.  So he had to leave the building.  Yeah.  Yes, we had to leave the building.  Did he fucking.  Did he go out the emergency exit to make a phone call?  Jesus.  How fucking creepy is that?  Did he come back with an orange wig?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a little frightful.  No, it's all.  It'll be in good fun. 
[00:20:30]  And why would he have to leave the building?  He had to get something out of the building, obviously.  Yes.  He had to get something that's located outside the building.  Breakfast.  I can tell you.  His costume.  Is he pulling someone off the street?  I'm not going to tell you.  Why would you have to leave the building?  Well, because he's got to get elements of the bed.  Breakfast.  So I know it's costume and breakfast as well.  Because you're the worst.  He's not pulling anyone off the street.  I'll say that.  Sam has the worst poker face.  So it's breakfast and he's going to be wearing some kind of costume.  Costume.  So he's going to be giving us breakfast in a strange way. 
[00:21:00]  I can't tell you.  Oh my God.  That's exactly what's happening.  I don't know.  Is he going to put donuts on his dick?  I can't tell you.  Yum.  Yeah.  Yum.  Dr. Ging goes, yeah.  Hopefully it's these little mini ones.  Ooh.  Get these pesky donuts off of this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get these donuts off my breakfast.  Yeah.  Make sure it's not all sticky.  Oh my God.  A little.  A little.  You got some time though.  I'd say you have at least 10 minutes. 
[00:21:30]  10 more minutes.  Okay.  Yeah.  So then we could talk about that blast on the east side.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Just have some video.  What was it?  72nd and 2nd.  2nd Avenue for the locals.  Put in that 2nd Avenue subway.  Subway line.  And you never think about that.  Like subways, you always think, ah, they've always been there and there's just tunnels  under there and there's trains running at them.  But no, they got to make those things.  Yeah.  And when you have a working city, it's very difficult to dig giant train tunnels underneath 
[00:22:00]  a city.  So what they do is they use a lot of dynamite and they blast these things.  So they were doing, I guess, an elevator shaft.  They were blasting out an elevator shaft.  And they placed their dynamite and then the guys come in and another crew comes in and  puts those big chain mats, heavy mats over the explosives.  And then they blow it up and it goes, boom.  You know, it doesn't really blast up and stuff because it's covered.  Well, apparently they covered the wrong shaft. 
[00:22:30]  Ah.  And this was just an open shaft with explosives in it.  Holy fuck.  And it blasted fucking cement chunks.  Wow.  Eight stories high.  Some of them higher.  And nobody was killed or even hurt.  But someone got a great picture of it.  Yeah.  See, I was convinced it's still from a video.  But Anthony said no.  A guy was in the area.  He was out with his wife.  He was testing out his hip replacement that he had gotten. 
[00:23:00]  And he had a nice pro camera around his neck.  I guess he's a professional photographer.  And he was just going to walk around and see if he saw anything interesting.  I guess he did.  Come on.  He said as he was walking, he just saw the ground explode in front of him the next block over.  And he just amazingly picked up his camera and just started snapping away.  E-Rock, we're going to put that on the Facebook page or I see you scrolling over there.  What are you scrolling for?  Anything fun?  I think someone's fired.  For this? 
[00:23:30]  Someone will get fired for putting the mats on the wrong fucking hole.  So fired.  Yeah, we'll put it on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Thank you.  Escalator shaft.  Who's correcting my fucking shit?  I just heard it on the news.  Shut up.  Escalator.  Elevator.  Close enough.  Hey, masturbator.  Close enough.  It gets you.  It moves people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, it blew up.  And there was an error in judgment.  Shit went all over the place. 
[00:24:00]  There's also a video of it from a security camera.  It looked pretty wild.  So some black guy is like dancing around on the sidewalk.  And it just blows up behind him.  He's like, why?  Freaks out.  Everyone starts running away.  Damn.  Of course.  Yeah.  Where's Rob, Sam?  He's working on it.  See, we just did material there.  Speaking of huge bombs.  Where's Rob?  He's working on it.  Here's the subway exposure video. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, here.  Well, that's one of them.  Well, it already happened.  That wasn't a good one at all.  The security cam one is much, much better.  Yeah, that's the aftermath.  Much better.  I want to check out this project.  We have any fans?  Don't cray.  Bring me underground.  I want to check it out.  I want to check out some underground shit.  You want to see what that shit look like down there?  Yes.  Of course I do.  But it's a security issue.  Why?  I don't know.  Everything is a security issue these days.  You know, I fucking jammed on the brakes coming in. 
[00:25:00]  Because remember I got that ticket from the fucking MTA police?  Oh, yeah.  Because I whizzed past them, not thinking that they could give people tickets on Long Island  Expressway.  And they want to make an example of you.  Right.  And so I'm winging down the old expressway this morning coming into work, and I see an  SUV with police on the back.  I know it's not NYPD, but I wanted to see what it was.  But I wanted to slow down also.  And it turned out to be a Homeland Security fucking SUV.  And I even, I had to start thinking like, can this motherfucker give me a ticket? 
[00:25:30]  So I had to slow down.  I was fucking waiting, waiting.  It's like three exits until he got off.  I had to do the speed limit.  Hate the speed limit.  How fast you...  Stupid speed limit.  How fast you go?  I usually drive 90.  All the way in?  Well, between 85 and 90.  All the way in.  And if I even have to slow down to 70, I'm pissed.  And there was some...  Let me tell you something.  I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit.  Asians don't know how to get out of the fucking left lane. 
[00:26:00]  See, that's very racist.  I'm sorry.  That's extremely racist.  It's not racist.  It's based on what I see on a daily basis.  Daily basis.  When I pull up behind a car and they're fucking oozing in the left lane, and then I got to  finally pass him, and I give him the fucking headlight.  I give him the stink light right in his fucking side view mirror.  I go over as far as I can.  And I'm like, wah, wah, and I see...  I could see him all lit up in his mirror because I'm shining my light in there.  And then they just sit there.  But all you have to do, if you're squinting, you don't see that light. 
[00:26:30]  No, it's annoying.  Yeah, look at you.  No, it's...  Yeah, exactly.  It's...  So I usually...  What do you do?  You aim the light right on that side view?  Oh, yeah.  I'll pull over.  I swear, my door handle is against the cement barrier just so I can get as much light in  that fucking window as possible.  How great is that?  And then they still, they don't move over.  So then I got to go around them, and then I give them the look, and their dumb fucking  face looking straight ahead.  Not even looking at me like, fuck you, I got you, or fuck you, I'm staying here, or fuck 
[00:27:00]  you, it's my road too.  They just don't have a clue.  And it's all the time.  It's always the Asian?  All the time.  Many Asians have no concept of moving over to the right if you're not going as fast as  the cars that are...  And I'm not the only one, because I've zipped around these cars, and there's a line of cars  having to do the same thing behind them.  Like, I'll accelerate, and then I look at my rearview mirror, and I see he's still there. 
[00:27:30]  And then he's like, he's got 20 other cars behind him.  How much do you hate someone that doesn't respect those unwritten rules of the road to not get  the fuck out of the way?  Unnecessary lane changes, where they just change into the left lane and do nothing different  than they were doing in the middle lane?  Is that a me, me, me thing?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolute self-centeredness.  Or no concept.  I think it's complete cluelessness more than me, me, me, me.  But how do you not know someone high beam again?  It's the whole concept that someone's behind you, and that all you have to do is move out 
[00:28:00]  of the way.  Well, it is selfish, though.  I don't think it's a me, me, me.  I really don't.  I think just...  No, no, to think that no one is on the road but you is selfish.  No one's on the road.  No one's being inconvenienced by what you're doing.  It's like, really?  It's selfish.  And another thing, here's something else that happens constantly.  When they shut down a lane on the expressway from three lanes to two lanes, and then it's  like the left lane, and then it finally opens up, people will get into the left lane just 
[00:28:30]  because it's empty and not go any faster than they were going when there were only two lanes.  It's so infuriating.  Like, I'm looking.  I'm looking for the end of the cones.  I'm like, come on, come on.  I'm ready to cut over to the left and goose it.  And some motherfucker will always boop into the left just because now it's open and not  go any faster than they were going in that line of cars in the middle lane because the 
[00:29:00]  lane was closed.  I love anyone that's in the right lane and they make this dramatic move where you're  jamming on the brakes or doing something, and then you look at the person like, now,  please explain to me why you had to do that.  Like, they had clear sailing in the right lane or whatever it would be.  Yeah.  And you look like, really?  We were almost in a major accident here, and you're not even making a move.  Your brain just decided, I need to be in the left lane now?  There are people that don't know how to drive.  The driving test should be a lot harder. 
[00:29:30]  I agree.  I really think it should be a lot fucking harder.  It'd be a pain in the ass for everybody, but I agree.  Make it harder.  Oh, here's another great one that I notice every time I'm driving in or out of the city.  When a car is parallel parking on a city street, it pretty much has to kick its nose out when  it's backing in, so it kind of blocks the street for a couple of seconds, which is fine.  I'm not completely insane, contrary to popular belief.  I understand that we might have to stop for that, but there are people that stop for it  and then wait for the motherfucker to park, get out, go into the building, do a go about 
[00:30:00]  his business before they then pass the fucking car.  The second the road is now open, you don't have to wait for him to get all the way into his  parking spot.  The second you're clear, go.  But they fucking wait until he's all the way in the spot.  Infuriating.  That was very good right there, but where's Rob?  Rob?  Is Rob here?  He's not back yet.  If we could expand on the drivers.  Wait, the curtains are being closed.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:30:30]  That's a part of the big thing, right?  The curtains are going to be closed, because there's going to be a big surprise.  All right, look.  Hold on.  I don't like surprises like this.  Should we be filming this?  For evidence.  Yeah, of course we should.  For evidence.  Yeah, I guess.  Yes, we should be filming here and film this.  Sal, put down your production.  Exactly.  Stop putting unnecessary music to something.  I can get in here with a camera.  How big of a disappointment has Sal been so far?  Huge. 
[00:31:00]  I mean, to watch somebody's stock fall as fast and hard as it has with Sal is unbelievable.  We've got a Facebook issue with Sal, right?  Sal was Facebook.  Such expectations.  Yes.  Such expectations.  Oh, my God.  What a bust.  Grand IPO.  Let's get in there.  This guy's going to be big.  What a bust.  Yeah, we realized, because I think I, yeah, Sal was like, it was all potential, like Facebook.  And then we put the money into him, and we realized, well, there's just no way to make 
[00:31:30]  a profit with Sal.  Right.  Like, there's just no money to be made.  That's why, business-wise, it makes no sense.  Yeah, but we're losing money, too.  It's not just not making, we're losing money.  With Sal.  Take the loss.  And it's like, you just, you hope that you can make it up in your other investments,  but I don't know.  Look, I can't make up any more shit.  Where's Rob?  Don't worry about it.  We can't do our show until his dope comes in with his dopey bit.  I know, right?  Obviously, it's a costume, and it's obviously breakfast.  See, this is going to make it worse when he comes in, because it's like, you guys have 
[00:32:00]  been, oh, we can't do the show until we finally get the big reveal, and then he's going  to come in, and you're going to be like, what?  We just wasted an hour on the show, technically, because of that bullshit.  Well, hopefully Chip is standing by to take us to break.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I'm begging for Chip today.  I'm begging for him.  Okay, let's go to break.  No.  Not yet.  Not yet, Chip.  No one's ever asked me to take on the break before.  I don't know how to do it.  We've got about five minutes.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You idiot. 
[00:32:30]  No, come on.  He's here.  He's preparing his items.  He put a lot of thought into this.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's just...  Travis.  Cool.  When is Rob going to be ready?  A couple minutes.  He's in the office getting ready.  Do you think it's going to go over as well as he thinks it's going to go over?  No.  Does he have high expectations?  I don't know.  Why would we do something that obviously is not going to work?  Because it's 645.  Right.  Because it's the Rob hour. 
[00:33:00]  I'd say, why wouldn't we?  This is perfect.  Are we going to start now?  Well, here's the thing.  Perfect.  We kind of put Rob through the ringer for like two and a half hours.  And really, we were a little rough on him.  So I thought as a show, it would be best to give him the benefit of a doubt and say,  you know what?  Let's give you the opportunity to come out of this and maybe leave on a positive note.  You come up with something.  And this is his way of getting back into your favor. 
[00:33:30]  Very good.  Very good.  He's working on it right now.  He's having a few technical issues.  Technical issues?  People are screaming on Twitter.  He can't put the fucking magazine into the fucking gun.  It's a technical issue.  He can't fucking cock the gun.  Is that him?  That's our videographer.  Danny's in studio with a camera.  Wait.  Wait.  Close the door.  He doesn't even close the door.  Get back outside.  This guy doesn't even know how to present a bit.  Get outside.  He just walks in. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Why did he just walk in?  And why was he walking toward me?  You know how I don't like things and people coming toward me.  He's a moron.  We're getting set up and he just walks in.  He had a piggy costume.  Now he's walking.  Will you get outside?  He's so stupid.  I'll open the door when you're ready.  Well, don't you think we should have been ready? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  At the very least?  He walked in twice.  All right.  So far, what we've seen.  Hold on.  So far, what we've seen.  And he just starts talking.  There's no mic on him.  So, you know.  Well, he's nervous.  He walked in so far and he's like throwing Monopoly money around.  What?  So, there's Monopoly money on the floor.  There is.  Huh?  Mike Seven.  And Monopoly money and he has a pig nose.  And a pig.  And a pink costume with a belly.  I don't know what it is.  That's so stupid.  That's stupid. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Here's Pool Party Rob, I guess.  Okay.  Let's get away from here.  All right.  Here it comes.  Fucking Nagel in this bitch.  I got Egg McMuffins.  Oh.  For everyone.  Oh, he's Eric Nagel.  He's throwing money around and handing out Egg McMuffins.  Thank you.  Oh, I get it now.  All right.  Because it's Eric Nagel.  Look at Eric's face.  What happened?  Do the thing.  Oh.  Oh, fucking Nagel in this bitch. 
[00:35:30]  He's Nagel in this bitch.  What up?  So.  I suck.  Oh, man.  What is he supposed to be?  Eric Nagel?  Yeah.  He's supposed to be Eric.  Mr. Piggy Boy, Eric Nagel.  He's a pig.  E-Rock, he's calling you Piggy Boy.  E-Rock, comment.  This is so bad.  I can't even get mad at this.  What?  What are you doing? 
[00:36:00]  I actually want to eat that, but I won't.  Yeah, take mine.  Well, hold on.  Let's talk.  Pink's Snuggie on.  He stuffed his belly so he's got a big gut.  And he's got a piggy nose on.  And he's got a McDonald's bag.  And he's giving out some sausage McMuffins.  Yes.  Rob, comment.  Rob?  Uh, I couldn't find a pig.  So, this was your bit, but you couldn't find a pig costume?  Yeah, but I figured, hey, what the hell?  Why not go for it, you know?  I love a fucking sausage McMuffin. 
[00:36:30]  That is my weakness.  I will say.  Really?  That's your weakness?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I never eat them.  They're pretty good.  I didn't know that.  What else did you get besides that?  Oh, man.  Uh, nothing.  They were righteous.  But, you know, something else will be planned for tomorrow.  It'll be better.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, Rob also let us know that.  A shotgun and a toe trigger.  He does want to do something, you know, on Thursday and Friday.  Because those are his last two days.  I want to go out with a bang.  So, believe me, I could help you. 
[00:37:00]  Wow, that's Anthony's weakness.  All the shit that we have in here that you won't try.  I know.  It's an egg McMuffin.  That's what gets you.  Sausage, yeah.  More than egg McMuffin, you like a sausage McMuffin?  Why am I saying that with stunned shots?  Well, the sausage patties from McDonald's are ridiculous.  Yeah, they're just delicious.  Oh, God, are they good?  It's trash, but it's so fucking good.  I'm not going to be able to eat anything else all day.  I don't really know what happened.  It's understandable.  Well, no, Sam, you were completely correct. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  There's nothing here to even work with.  No.  He's trying way too hard.  E-Rock should be blasting them, though.  I wouldn't let...  Can you please tell us what you expected?  Like, what kind of...  I don't know.  I'll just make fun of Eric, and then hopefully...  He made a pigtail with duct tape.  Let me see.  Oh, there it is.  Is that your real belly or a fake belly to make you look fat?  It's like a pinky blanket around him.  Yeah, it's a snaggy.  Did you think we'd be like, whoa, man, E-Rock! 
[00:38:00]  Oh, man, this is the best!  No, I just...  Party schmarty, you're hilarious!  It sucked, I know.  No, it was all right.  Okay.  E-Rock.  Comment?  I want to fucking punch him in the face.  Oh!  Someone's going HR today.  Ooh, someone...  We got a month left.  Who cares?  What?  So, E-Rock, that's your whole comment?  No, it's just...  What am I supposed to do?  This is so horrible.  Kick him in the balls, right?  It's pathetic. 
[00:38:30]  It's not even good.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  One of your boys right there.  I can't laugh at it saying, all right, you did a good job.  It's one of your boys right there, E-Rock.  It's a truth bomb in there.  Yeah.  Fuck, E-Rock.  That's one of your boys, though, E-Rock.  You're in charge.  I hope that maybe something will be worked out.  It's under your command.  Well, that's the best part, that E-Rock is indeed the intern boss.  Yep.  And this is the intern.  This is how they treat him.  He comes in...  So you think E-Rock looks like a pig?  No.  You think he's a piggy boy?  This intern believes that E-Rock is basically a pig walking on his hind legs that throws money around in the air because he's so wealthy. 
[00:39:00]  He just walks around with egg McMuffins all the time.  That's what this intern thinks of his boss.  He has to dig them out for free.  Just tossing money up in the air.  He's so rich.  And has a big pot-bellied pig.  Yeah.  And he walks around on his hind legs with a little piggy tail.  And that's what he thinks of his boss, Eric Nagel.  Right.  Which is disrespectful, if you ask me.  Total insubordination right there.  But E-Rock just, once again, just takes it.  He's all right with it.  He's like, okay.  What should I do? 
[00:39:30]  I can't touch him.  I can't fire him.  I can't do anything.  So what am I supposed to do?  This is what I say to my kid.  Use your words.  E-Rock.  When I don't understand what's going on with my kid, I go, use your words.  So use your words with this kid.  What's up?  You have a microphone, E-Rock.  Yeah, I see that.  That's your weapon.  I mean, he was able to humiliate you without touching you.  That's an excellent point.  You know?  Really?  That's humiliation?  Really?  Well, he's kind of calm.  He's calling you a piggy boy.  Yeah.  A rich piggy boy.  A rich piggy boy. 
[00:40:00]  He's humiliated himself in the process.  Obviously, he failed miserably, but he is calling you a piggy boy.  Right.  Yeah.  A big, rich piggy boy.  That part is very obvious.  Yeah.  Big, rich, yeah.  Piggy boy.  Saying you're a snout-wielding piggy boy.  Comes around with big muffin treats.  And a curly-cued tail.  Yeah, a little curly-cued tail.  The idea itself, not so bad that E-Rock would be walking around just throwing egg McMuffins  at everyone.  Yeah, cash and McMuffins. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, he just bleeds it because he's just so much of it.  Come on, E-Rock.  What do you got on this kid?  He's got that weird pool party.  Why am I going to try to save his bit?  This sucks.  Because we also have the same listeners that are hearing this bit.  Yeah.  So you're talking to ears that are ours, too.  Yeah, they're begging for something right now, E-Rock.  The show.  Think of the show.  Yeah, exactly.  You've punished the listeners enough.  Now it's time to give them something good.  Look, the kid's going to be gone in two days.  We'll never see him again.  Exactly.  Maybe earlier.  There's not even a chance that this place will be.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:41:00]  Was that a shot?  Are you allowed to fire him?  No.  Yeah, I'm allowed to fire him.  Is he?  Yes.  You are?  Yes.  This is not a fireball offense?  I didn't say that.  If I came in dressed up like one of the bosses, it was like, hey, look at me.  I'm throwing money everywhere.  Imagine that.  You so don't have the balls to fire this kid.  Oh.  Really?  No.  Yeah, really.  Plus, I think every person would say, really, yes.  You come in dressed like, imagine if you came in dressed like Gary.  Oh, my God.  And then you just started doing, like, nothing. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  I'd be in such trouble.  Everyone handing you big kazoo autographs asking for an autograph.  Oh, I fucked up.  Oh, no.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I meant to say something else.  Oh, we knew.  Oh, no.  Where's?  There's Monopoly money all over the floor.  Uh-oh.  Eric's coming in here.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Take a fight.  Take a fight.  Uh-oh.  Because your boy's taking his time.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, Troy Kwan.  I love Troy Kwan with the brand new hairdo.  Brand new hair.  You like this?  This is great.  Why is this great?  Troy loves it.  In my opinion, Rob's bouncing back great.  Wow.  Really?  Can I grab an egg or muffin?  Yeah.  Here, you can have mine.  That was pretty goddamn good.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Oh, there's more in the bag.  There's a lot more in the bag.  God, I want to eat one so badly.  Where'd Eric go?  Treat yourself.  I believe he's going to get Rob's stuff.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:42:30]  He's going to do something with it.  Uh-oh.  Why is he going to...  You think Eric's going to pretend to fire him?  Yeah, he is.  I'm pretty righteous.  And Rob will be back in here tomorrow morning making fun of Eric again.  We already know that he can't fire him.  Oh, my God.  Is E-Rock going to go with the...  He can't fire him, right?  But he's going to make believe he can?  I don't think he really can.  Oh, no.  Prepare for douche.  Oh, this is going to be douchey.  Oh, my God.  And Sam's on to something.  It'll be like after the fake firing, we get to have Rob make fun of E-Rock again tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  This turns into an E-Rock bit again. 
[00:43:00]  Take your stuff and get the hell out of here.  How did this turn around to bashing E-Rock?  I'm amazed.  This should have all been you being shit on.  Where's E-Rock?  Here comes E-Rock.  Here comes...  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  That's close to Kenny.  Oh, no.  It's because E-Rock didn't come back at him.  He came in dressed like a pig throwing money in the air and saying, I'm Eric Nagel.  I'm Nagel.  I'm Nagel in this bitch.  And E-Rock's going to come in with a fake box with a name placard in it.  Oh, God.  Hit the bridge, bucko.  Some black and white pictures of a married couple. 
[00:43:30]  A plant.  You are fired.  Where's E-Rock?  I don't know.  Why would he be here?  He's...  Is he gathering up your clothes?  He's doing his bit.  He's getting his bit together.  E-Rock's getting his bit together now?  Yeah, no.  It's E-Rock's bit.  Cool.  What, he's going to knock off 300 pounds and come in dressed like Rob?  All of a sudden, we're all supporting Rob.  What happened there?  How did that happen?  I don't know, because, you know, when you just...  All right, here comes E-Rock. 
[00:44:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the boss.  Here he comes.  Oh, no.  The boss is here.  Let me tell you something.  Don't cross the boss.  Oh, shit.  Good one.  Eric, have an Egg McMuffin.  Do you like Egg McMuffins?  No, not really.  Why?  They're delicious?  They are delicious, but they don't rest well.  They're very refreshing.  He gets a sour stomach.  He gets a sour stomach.  Do you get the mudslides?  Yeah, it gets pretty bad. 
[00:44:30]  That and Big Macs just...  Not my friends.  What do you got for this kid who's dressed just like you?  He's still got the Big Macs on.  A mere two feet away from you.  And Troy thinks it's great.  Troy does think.  Troy got free breakfast, so he doesn't care.  Are you liking it, Troy?  This is pretty great.  Isn't it great?  Yeah.  Rob's bouncing back.  Rob's bouncing back.  I did appreciate the Sausage McMuffin.  That's pretty good shit right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got you.  Are you right?  Come on, Tank.  Hey, Rob. 
[00:45:00]  What did you think?  Remember to come in for.  Leave his nose on.  I'm taking it.  Oh, you pulled the pig nose off.  He pulled his nose off.  Why?  Why would you do that?  Oh, Rob just pulled his nose.  Rob said, I got your nose.  Okay.  Yeah, Rob said, I got your nose.  I like his nose on.  I'm going to fix his nose.  Rob fixed that.  It was cute.  Put the nose back on.  It's destruction of property.  Yeah, you can't break his pig nose.  He should come in here with a Pinocchio nose.  Because he lies a lot.  All right.  You rock.  There's not much I can fire him, but what's the point? 
[00:45:30]  Sam's shaking his head.  Good for fucking Sam.  I'm just pointing out what's going on here.  I love how you make this, like, this is my fucking bit.  Like, I came up with this shit.  When he walks in with a dope costume.  All I'm saying is, Sam is shaking his head going, you can't fire the kid.  Sam, am I right?  I'm not sure.  I mean, if I could fire him and he was doing a, look at me, I'm Sam Roberts and make fun  of me, he would have been fired.  Just be so fired, right?  Just being an asshole and just being a dick.  Not doing his job.  Not doing his job, right?  Just being a fucking cock.  While we're looking for things on the internet, he's relaxing like he's got his feet up at 
[00:46:00]  the fucking ottoman.  He goes on the computer and just can't find one fucking thing we want.  Ugh.  We're totally getting removed from the point.  I'm saying if that were the case, I would have fired him already.  If I had that ability.  Can you fire him?  I can.  You're deciding to not fire him?  Because you can't fire him, really?  Can you really fire him?  I can fire him, but this is on the air.  So I can't technically fire him for that.  To just say that you can't fire him. 
[00:46:30]  He's coming up with a reason why he's not firing him because you can't really fire him?  That's what I'm thinking.  I mean, technically, this could be the most insubordinate thing I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, we all mock the bosses, but it's very rare we dress like them and come in in pig outfits.  Throwing money in the air.  Yeah, making dumb noises.  Throwing egg McMuffins at everyone.  He really did fucking accurately portray the Nagel.  I'm glad everybody's staying on that topic. 
[00:47:00]  But you said Rob is dressed exactly like Eric.  Why do you have to point that out?  Because there was a great line that needed attention.  I hope that slipped by, but I guess not.  What made you decide to do that?  I don't know.  I was...  Are you saying that he's a bit piggy looking?  A bit.  Oh, E-Rock.  Wow.  By the way, I turned all the mics off, so technically that wasn't on the air, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Come on, fire him. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, or at least give him a verbal thrashing.  Yeah, give him a talkie son's check.  I can't fire him on the air for this.  Guy's going fucking...  He's...  Oh!  He's putting his little piggy nose back on.  Oh, the poor kid.  So at least give him a verbal thrashing.  Make him scared to do it again.  He's unscathed.  Yeah.  He's unscathed.  Yeah, give him a warning.  He's already planning his next costume.  He fucked you in the ass.  And there will be a costume tomorrow if he's not fired.  He's wondering if he has a gray one with his stomach in an elephant trunk.  I wouldn't tolerate this. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  No way.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  What do you got?  E-Rock?  I can't.  Anything?  Come on, virus.  Oh, God, right?  Punishment.  Might as well.  Come on, E-Rock.  Yeah, what are you going to do about that?  I can't do anything.  What are you going to do?  Isolate that.  Oh, man.  Oh, hey, Eric, it's not fucking Jim that shit all over you.  I know.  I can beat up sweet little Jimmy Norton if he wants to.  Right.  That doesn't seem to be the problem here. 
[00:48:30]  Clean yourself up here.  Oh, there he goes.  Yeah, piggy nose is back on.  Troy's helping him out.  Yeah, it's upside down, but it's not.  Troy loves it.  Troy loves this.  Why do you love this so much, Troy?  Well, I just, Rob had a bad day the other day.  Right?  I mean.  Did he?  And it's just kind of good to see him pick himself back up and brush himself off and dress  like a pig.  And end with a bang.  He brushed the mud off himself.  Wow.  And E-Rock does nothing.  Oh.  Why are you doing that?  Don't I got his nose off? 
[00:49:00]  That was violent.  He not only pulled, E-Rock not only pulled the piggy nose off of Rob, but before he pulled  it off, he smacked him in the nose, like mushed it into his face hard, and then pulled  it off.  Wow.  E-Rock.  How weird would it be if E-Rock gets fired today for minding his own business?  Oh, my God.  You can't take, he wants to leave his nose on.  You think Rob should leave the pig nose on?  Yes, absolutely.  You can't take someone's pig nose off.  We are really.  Can the regulations say that?  If a boy puts a pig nose on?  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  We are really pulling a Jimmy to Tommy to Spider. 
[00:49:30]  E-Rock is going to wind up fucking doing something bad because we're egging him on.  No, we don't want him to do anything.  We're egg McMuffening him on.  We just phoned E-Rock to make some, you know, give some statements.  You don't want you to do anything.  Just say some stuff.  He fucking dresses like a pig, says it's you, and you let this happen?  It's this world coming to.  He's rubbing his belly, by the way, while he's standing next to Eric.  Oh, yes.  Are you really?  You're having fun, aren't you, Rob?  Oh, I'm having a great time.  Oh, man.  I'm having a great time. 
[00:50:00]  Coming back a little bit from the whole pool party thing.  Yes, he is.  I must say, just a little bit.  Well, he's not scared of E-Rock's authorities today.  No, not at all.  He's mocking him.  Yeah, I would say he has disdain for it.  Have you ever considered E-Rock your boss, Rob?  In the beginning.  Kind of like what we said about Gary well over a year ago.  So, Rob?  So, initially, he was like your boss, but now you just kind of look at him like, eh, just 
[00:50:30]  a guy.  What happened?  I'll tell you what happened.  It's because no one else around here is allowed to be in charge of these fucking interns.  So, I got stuck being in charge of the interns, and then everyone goes around and says, no,  you don't have to listen to them.  And then all the interns go, yeah, you know what?  You're right.  I'll just listen to everybody else.  So, since they're not allowed to be in charge, I have to be in charge.  You're a figurehead.  And then they go, exactly.  Queen Elizabeth fucking...  They've set up a puppet regime.  They're pulling your strings from behind the scenes. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, Charles Taylor, why can't you fire this kid?  But in all fairness, E-Rock, we told you to resign from the position, because they're  not even paying you for the extra responsibilities, and you refused to resign.  I did at one point, yeah.  Why would you take a position where you can only get in trouble with no fucking advancement  or salary increase?  They don't give you any extra money.  Because I thought I was helping the show, since nobody else was allowed to have this position 
[00:51:30]  at the time.  Not helping the company, helping the show.  Helping the show.  That's very telling.  Well, E-Rock is very dedicated to the show.  You got lines on your face from the pig nose, by the way.  That was from Eric.  Yanking it?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So you're going to continue being in charge of the interns, E-Rock?  For another two days, yeah.  And then what happens?  And then someone else takes over.  Oh, who?  Passing the baton. 
[00:52:00]  That's only for a week while you're gone.  No, it's not.  And Rob said, passing the baton.  That was where Rob said that?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock's saying he's quitting, basically.  If he were quitting, he'd quit today.  The total lack of respect.  Why wait the two days?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Why wait?  Make it official.  Make it official now, so this conversation doesn't have to come up when the new batch comes  in.  Right.  Nope.  I ride it out to my last day.  Which is what?  Two days from now?  Yeah, on Friday.  And you're done being the intern boss? 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  So this piggy outfit got you to resign?  No.  I can't take it.  You were going to resign anyway?  This happened before this, yeah.  And he just goes along with no consequence.  Oinking away.  No consequence.  What can I do here?  Oinks into the sunset.  No consequence.  Man.  What could you do?  Use your wit and cunning.  You can't touch him, but you can say what you want.  Use your wit and cunning to fucking chop him down a couple of notches.  Hey, pool party Rob.  What are you, swimming?  You know?  Just something like that. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, nice pig nose.  What are you, snorting a bunch of mud or something?  See, see, see.  Thanks.  Like, what happened to your party with the other farm animals?  They didn't show, did they?  Yeah, what were they, the watering hole or something?  Yeah.  Oh, you're moving your brother to a different barn or something?  Right, a different barn.  That's good.  Oh!  Oh, he pulls the nose off again, very aggressively.  He's a crazy person.  Why assault people?  Yeah.  You know what?  Nose really gets him.  So many people hated Rob, but now the chant really is coming in. 
[00:53:30]  E-Rob.  E-Rob.  E-Rob.  E-Rob.  He had this kid.  He's making a comeback.  He really is.  At E-Rock's expense.  And after that debacle, I'm so surprised.  Wow.  The only thing that could have brought him back.  He knew.  I think you could fire him.  Why are you ripping the piggy nose?  How about you try to fire him and see what happens?  E-Rob's trying to rip the piggy nose.  See how it plays out.  I can't fire him on the air.  Or quit today.  And say, well, then he's not my responsibility if I can't fire him.  As soon as he walks out of the studio dressed as you, you can fire him. 
[00:54:00]  Because that's off the air.  How come he ripped up the, that pig nose really got you, didn't he?  Oh, he did not like that piggy nose.  That pig.  He's so fucking nailed you.  Oh, man.  All you had to do is come back and kind of fucking knock him down a couple of notches  with some fucking verbal barbs.  That's all.  He's just like pork.  People are like, come on, E-Rock.  Defend yourself.  Yeah, just go in there and get him.  How do you defend against this fucking costume? 
[00:54:30]  It is bad.  That's horrible.  Hey, yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  Like, where'd you go to the pig store or something?  Right there.  Boom.  Good one.  Thanks.  That's it.  It's easy.  Like, you could be like, Rob, where'd you get a Rob's mom costume?  Something like that.  Oh, yeah.  See, that would have been a very good one.  And you had nothing to do with this.  I swear, dude, you could ask Travis.  I swear to God on this one.  I had not.  Rob, Rob, you tell him.  Did you come to me with this idea complete?  And I said, do whatever you want. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't even help him put the costume together.  You asked me this morning, will you staple the legs for me?  And I said, Rob, I'm not going to come anywhere near your whole costume.  This whole bit is all you.  I won't be attached to it.  This shows no respect whatsoever.  It shows none.  Holy fuck.  It's just like, are the other interns laughing today?  They're loving this.  What's Conor doing in there?  Yeah, Rob's got like a big smile on his face.  Conor's excited.  His shit-eating grin.  Yes.  Shit.  Shit heads.  Shit heads.  What happened there, Iraq? 
[00:55:30]  Rob's having a ball today.  It's basically like, Rob is saying, all right, who's the one guy that I could make fun of  and just destroy and completely get off scot-free?  Oh, my boss.  Exonerate myself for the fucking debacle.  Iraq, did you hear what Sam just said?  I heard what he said.  Okay, I want to make sure you heard that.  I heard it.  Because that was very rude.  Yeah, he's sitting right next to me.  That was very rude.  That's what Rob is saying.  Oh.  Well, defend yourself.  Say something to me, Iraq.  I'll take that.  Come on, what are you doing?  I think the kid's a piece of shit.  Whoa.  Jesus, he's just an intern.  Well, he is dressed like you. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, relax.  He's learning.  He's trying to learn.  That's all the lies.  Jesus.  That's just a kid.  Yeah, I mean, make fun of him.  There's no reason to take the gloves off.  Right.  Oh.  What else?  He throws shitty pool parties, obviously.  Yeah.  He's got those fucking deformities that he walks around with.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Yeah, that's not an HR issue.  Oh, shit.  This fucking poor fucking kid is, I don't know, whatever happened to you.  God bless.  Mother probably drank a lot.  Watch your party.  He comes in with disastrous feet, and all of a sudden, you've got to mock him on the air. 
[00:56:30]  I'm sorry on behalf of all of us.  At least I don't have that stomach.  Oh, God damn.  I don't know if you heard that, but he'd rather have webbed feet than a big belly.  No, I'm just making sure you heard that, because I think that's very real.  I heard it.  Okay.  That was a rough one.  Man.  You'd rather have webbed toes than a big belly.  Oh, yeah.  I could swim fast.  No one really cares.  No one sees it.  Who knows?  But you're saying with the stomach, they would see it.  A little bit. 
[00:57:00]  Do you officially have four or five toes on each foot?  I say four.  You say four?  I say four.  Oof.  What?  How do you have four?  Well, the two are together.  Oh, right.  Yeah, two of them are stuck together.  That is weird.  And not just a little bit.  Iraq, comment?  Anything that you got, you know, besides just, like you're looking them up and down looking  for something.  It's just, it's amazing that through this whole time, when everyone else was saying this kid's 
[00:57:30]  a piece of shit, and making fun of him.  I never said that.  I didn't either.  That the one person who actually was helping him out with all this stuff, is this is what  he tries to pull.  Oh!  You were helping.  He turned around and fucked you, even though you were helping him through this.  The only guy that was supporting you, Rob.  Helping him through this.  Does that make you feel guilty, or no?  I mean, he did buy me lunch the other day, on Tuesday.  Yeah, but is that like, you're smiling.  This kid was fucking crying after his beating. 
[00:58:00]  Does he buy you lunch, or do you just follow him around like a pilot fish?  He's getting his scraps.  Wait, now I got an issue.  No lunch has been sent.  Now I got an issue.  Iraq walks into the deli, Rob walks into the deli.  But I got an issue.  I'll drink to your leg of lamb.  Why are you buying him lunch after I gave him 50 bucks that day?  I offered to pay it, too.  What the fuck, Iraq?  Why would he want to fuck him?  Why would you buy him lunch when he made an easy 50? 
[00:58:30]  Okay, because I'm supposed to be in charge of these assholes, and I'm supposed to take  care of them and make sure that they're doing everything right, and it's supposed to be  a learning experience.  Right.  And when he spends two and a half hours, because he's a fucking compulsive liar, and comes up  with all this shit, and he's sitting there practically crying at the phone screening station.  I didn't actually cry at all.  Oh, bullshit.  We saw you.  I didn't.  So after the thing, I'm like, you know what?  This kid took a brutal beating.  He's not paid to be here.  I'll do something nice, and I'll take him down for lunch just to make sure he's okay. 
[00:59:00]  What a gay.  Fair enough.  So Eric buys him lunch, and he repays Eric's generosity by coming in here and throwing  Monopoly money around.  Dressed like a pig.  Yeah.  Sausage and egg McMuffins.  As if to say, Eric, you spent money on me, but the way I perceive it as, you just throw  your money around as if you're better than everyone.  Yeah, oinking all over town.  Right.  Right.  He's just nagling it up.  Nagling it up.  Is this from the area he lives in?  Much wealthier than where I live.  Oh.  Well, we saw his house on Google Earth.  Yeah.  Well, maybe his house. 
[00:59:30]  Who the fuck knows?  Yeah, true.  Good point.  Was that your house, at least?  I don't know.  I think so.  I mean, I do think so.  I live there.  How do you not know where you fucking live?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  You're up.  He's ready to pounce.  Just a little joke.  Like, yeah, obviously my house.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  He kind of was just being buried.  Remember that guy?  Remember the white car we saw in front of his house?  Yeah.  Why don't you make fun of the guy in the white car fucking his mom's or something like that?  Oh, wow.  That's what I would do. 
[01:00:00]  Always go back to the mom.  Always.  Always.  Right.  Enjoy that one because you can't say that.  You've got to say it allegedly.  No, you just say it probably.  I bet he was fucking your mom.  Yeah.  Right in the butt of something, right?  Right, Chip.  Yeah, while you was in the bushes watching.  What?  Go ahead.  Ridiculous parodies protected.  You don't even have to say it allegedly.  Good to hear.  There's something so ludicrous that no one would believe.  Good to hear.  I think a lot of people would believe that, though.  There was a white car there.  That's true.  White car, black man.  So go ahead.  You know, you just. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Basically, you see yourself as his mentor.  You're mentoring this guy.  And then he comes in just to score points with the guys.  By humiliating you.  You're saying, like, what is that about?  Interns slam two sausage McMuffins into my mouth.  This is a strange situation we've got here.  Iraq can't do much of anything.  And Rob, now that you know that, anything else you want to say? 
[01:01:00]  No, I'm okay.  I think I've.  Go ahead.  Any animal noises?  What animal noise?  I think it's fair.  What animal noise?  Oh, that would be the one.  Oh, man.  He's snoring like a hog.  Oh, Iraq.  Like a big, fat pig hog.  You know, you know, you know how sometimes the lieutenant in front of the men, if like one of the sergeant or something or one of the enlisted guys, the other enlisted guys beats on the lieutenant.  I don't want to hear this shit.  Because the second that happens, the second that happens, those above the lieutenant, higher ranking, turn around and go, oh, no, no, no, let him go, let him go. 
[01:01:30]  So it completely demines any authority over the lower ranks.  I don't know what demine means.  Demine.  Whatever.  This goes whatever.  Yes, that's what Oswald did to JFK.  He deminded me. 
[01:02:00]  But I do love the whatever.  Yes, undermines or demeans, people are saying.  Yeah, wow.  Fuck.  But you know what it is, though?  But we only do that because time and time again, your troops have done nothing but bash you.  Yeah.  You're the superior officer, and you're not keeping your troops in order.  You need discipline.  Discipline.  Strong discipline.  Well, I think E-Rock's so nice that a lot of them interpret that as weakness.  Well, you know what?  You can't be nice.  Rob, was E-Rock nice to you during this internship? 
[01:02:30]  He was very nice to me.  And you repay him by dressing up like a pig and throwing Egg McMuffins around?  And money.  And big money.  Niceness just breeds contempt in this atmosphere because you've got to be a strong leader.  And do you remember what he said, how he described his actions?  A slovenly pig.  Stupid.  Fuck off.  No.  What was the noise you made a minute ago?  Oh, he's making piggy noises.  This is what I'm talking about.  And he said he was Nagel-ing it in this bitch.  Nagel-ing it in this bitch. 
[01:03:00]  And Nagel-ing it is a pig throwing money and breakfasts out to everybody.  And Nagel literally just bought him a meal two days ago.  So he's taking that and actually using it against Eric.  Wow.  Eric, who showed generosity and compassion.  Oh, he certainly did.  He's now mocking that compassion in a pig outfit.  I thought I was just repaying him with breakfast.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  Did you see the tail that he made? 
[01:03:30]  He's shaking his bottom.  Ah, he's shaking his little tail.  I'm sorry, E-Rock had to go through this today.  Whoa.  Oh, Sal.  Sal is saying stuff in my ear.  Sal, come on in here.  Don't get the panda angry?  Yeah.  Do you know what?  Yeah.  Sal is saying stuff about you, by the way.  I just said that it looked like Eric was tearing up for a second there.  Whoa.  Sal, hey.  E-Rock.  Taking the attention off of how awful he is, too.  Oh.  You are bad, Sal.  That is true.  That is true.  Is Sal bad?  He's terrible.  E-Rock, don't get the piggy angry. 
[01:04:00]  Why don't you play your own bit?  It's right there.  Why don't you give me some more of your work, Eric?  Whoa.  What does that mean?  We don't have anything for Sal to do because his production sucks.  He doesn't come up with anything, so I've got other stuff to do.  This is crazy.  Wait, you're doing E-Rock's work, Sal?  Is that what you're claiming here today?  Yeah.  After a week from now, I'll be intern boss, probably.  Oh.  Oh.  And will you let interns just shit all over you like this?  No.  Rule with an iron fist.  Yeah.  Fist.  Got it.  I don't know.  Mark Z.  That sounds amazing.  Sit on an iron fist. 
[01:04:30]  Do you have a lisp, Sal?  I didn't even notice it.  I don't think so.  Okay.  I just did it that one time.  All right.  Puppet hair.  Sorry.  I love how you call him puppet hair.  Oh, yes.  Puppet dude.  Puppet hair.  What would we say, Sam?  No, just that, I mean, Sal's got shitted on before.  I would assume that the interns would be able to shit all over Sal, as they've done over  Eric.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who would be a better intern boss, Sal or E-Roc?  Well. 
[01:05:00]  Sal's pretty wimpy.  Sal is quite wimpy.  I almost said two there.  Oops.  But Sal was just an intern, though.  Sometimes the guy who becomes the new boss is more of a hard-on, it's like a young cop.  Yeah.  He's got something to prove.  Yeah, Sal's probably got something to prove.  He's going to get shit on and shit on them.  Right.  Is what he'll do.  E-Roc gets shit on and apparently just takes it and lets them dress like pigs and come in  here and fucking pronounce themselves as nagling in this bitch.  As nagling in this bitch.  Yeah.  And take your act of generosity the other day and mock it.  Yeah, that was nice.  Take a big pig shit on it. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So he bought a pig nose and everything.  He did.  He did.  I don't know what happened here.  Wow.  All right.  Well, it went a lot better than it initially did and a lot better than the speculation had  it.  We were told by the likes of Sam Roberts and Travis Gay that this is going to completely  bomb.  I thought it was too.  We were just going to say go to break.  But then it slowly turned. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  You figured it out.  You figured if you shit on E-Roc, all the heat will be off of you because everyone loves  to shit on E-Roc.  Right.  He's just giggling and having a ball over there.  Oh, he's chuckling in his little pig suit.  It was two hands on his belly that he put.  Rob knows the key to our hearts.  He really does.  He figured it out.  I bet this is very calculated.  Yeah, how the fuck did he turn this around?  I know, no, but he did.  He's a complete psycho for figuring that out.  I would say, though, that that's one of the better turnarounds in recent memory. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a big, big one-day turnaround.  You're going to dress like somebody tomorrow?  I was thinking of...  I don't know.  It's a risk now.  It is a risk.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I can't mess it up.  I want to leave on top like that.  What's better, this or summer camp?  Oh, this.  Wow, summer camp.  What's that about?  Rob loves summer camp.  Why?  Why, more gay man-on-man touching like school?  He went to summer camp every year and he loved it.  But now he's saying that dressing up like a pig representing his boss, he's having more 
[01:07:00]  fun being insubordinate than he ever did in arts and crafts.  Hey, Rob, do you want a little mini donut?  They're delicious.  Are they?  Yeah, have one.  They're from...  They're delicious.  Can I ask Rob why he likes summer camp?  Don't throw those away.  Oh, E-Rock.  Hey, E-Rock.  Eric.  Eric.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Holy shit.  E-Rock's making a move.  E-Rock.  Oh, man.  That must have broken his heart.  I know, right?  That's bittersweet for E-Rock.  That's like Anthony trying to, you know, throwing his gun away. 
[01:07:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock took the little donuts and threw them in the garbage while they were handing  them to Rob.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Now smash them.  Smashing the donuts.  Danny saved the tray, though.  Danny saved the tray.  They're too delicious.  Oh, my God.  And Troy's eating them out of the garbage.  That's wonderful.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Rob, what do you like about summer camp that you went every year?  Yeah, what's so good about summer camp?  I don't know.  It was just a lot of fun. 
[01:08:00]  What did you do in summer camp?  What was fun about summer camp?  Well, there was a lake.  Archery shooting.  You know, rock climbing.  Did you bang broads up there?  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  Here we go.  Here we go.  One.  Oh, no.  That's it.  No, okay.  How'd you have to count?  You went, um.  Because I wanted to.  One.  Because I got with other girls up there.  Got with?  Yeah.  Made out and stuff.  Made out.  Eric, you think he's telling the truth?  No. 
[01:08:30]  You think he's lying?  You'd have to go, uh, I better say something.  One.  Oh, boy.  You're right.  This is the kid who grabs junk and shoves his hand down people's ass cracks like a credit  card.  You think girls are really what he's going for?  What?  Yeah.  You remember his games they used to play?  The gay feel the junk in the dark?  Oh, that was this kid.  Oh, yeah.  He's the homoerotic one.  I'm with E-Rock.  I think he's a virgin, for real.  Okay.  No, I just think.  I think he's a virgin.  Do you think he's a virgin, Eric?  With females, yes.  You think he's had gay sex before? 
[01:09:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Who likes summer camp?  I loved it.  I had a great time.  And then I became a counselor.  Oh, yeah?  You think he was fucking people at the summer camp?  Boys?  Oh, man.  When he was a boy, obviously?  I don't think girls.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Man.  You're not mad.  Sharing a sleeping bag near a campfire.  Oh, boy.  That's fine.  That's a piece of Cooper.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  God, E-Rock's just grabbing its straws now. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, he is.  Wow.  He's eating it.  Orch is doing it.  The summer camp thing's a little weird.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a little weird.  My parents just shipped me off.  What's that?  Because I don't want to get a little bit.  At 11.  And then every year I'd go for a month.  What's up with you and your dad?  Nothing.  We have a great relationship.  Now you started in on something the other day and then bailed. 
[01:10:00]  I'm the favorite child of my dad.  Because I golf.  And he golfs.  So.  You so don't golf.  Okay.  That's a good fucking...  Okay.  ...only thing to have your father love you for.  Yeah.  Golfing.  I golf.  He golfs.  Yeah.  We're great.  Cold, fucking frigid relationship in that house.  Yeah, because you know when you golf, you don't talk much.  No, we do.  I mean, you know, we walk.  So.  How was school, son?  Oh, great dad. 
[01:10:30]  Smoke up, Johnny.  Who do you think is better at golfing, you or Urock?  Me.  Wow.  Yeah.  Urock?  He's probably right.  No.  Are you good at golf?  What's your handicap?  Seven.  Is that good?  That's really good.  I don't know if that's true.  That's probably a lie as well.  You think so?  Yeah, it's all a lie.  That means he's consistently shooting under 80.  We do know.  It's all lies.  Anyway.  You're shooting in the 70s every time out.  Almost, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:00]  He's such a liar.  I would put $1,000 on that.  Oh, boy.  That's fine shooting at that.  He wouldn't be interning at a radio show.  He'd be out making money.  Well, I don't know.  How?  You got to be more scratch.  Yeah.  Seven is a little high to be actually doing it full time.  Call my brother.  I shot a 79 on Sunday.  Probably won't be late.  Do you take fucking mulligans and shit?  But, Rob, a seven handicap means you're shooting 79 every time.  And just how you said, I shot a 79, that means you did it once.  No.  You have to do that consistently.  The day before my brother's wedding, I shot a 73. 
[01:11:30]  I'm good.  I'm not going to lie.  Wow.  I'm good.  This kid has paints to where it looks.  Let's see your air swing.  My air swing?  Let's see your air swing.  Oh, check out this air swing.  Keep in mind, he's got a big, fat pink costume.  Yeah, he's got a fat pink costume.  Travis knows golf, too.  That's pretty good.  I got to have a smooth...  I know we can do that.  I got a good swing.  I got a smooth swing.  70 hits.  Now let's say you're shooting up a big mountain. 
[01:12:00]  I would say he shoots in the low 80s.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Would make him more of a 10, 11.  Okay.  I guess we'll have to go out golfing.  Ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  Unlike some people, Rob doesn't put up with shit.  Oh, man.  Oh.  You take me golfing.  You rock.  You shoot a 79, I'll hand over $1,000 cash.  Okay.  That's fine.  Imagine how you're not going to shoot a 79.  You're not going to shoot a 79.  You're not going to be Rob out golfing for a day, just chumming around. 
[01:12:30]  And then they become friends.  Friends, you know, because the whole day on the course, especially if he's good.  Oh, I'll use him to play a good game of fucking golf.  If you want to come to New Jersey, I'll take you out.  Do you even have golf clubs?  Yeah.  Go back to the pool party.  We should do a golf club.  Oh, you belong to a club?  I do.  I do.  I have no doubt.  Nice.  Yeah, pretty much.  At this point, I have no doubt he's a very good golfer, but I'm telling you, a 7 handicap,  that's shooting 79 or better every fucking time out, basically. 
[01:13:00]  Maybe he does.  Maybe he does.  Travis, you think he's a 7?  I don't know.  I've never seen him golf, but he seems pretty confident.  Which means he's probably...  He was confident about the pool party, too.  That's a good point.  Comes back.  Swinging.  Piggy number two makes a good point.  He comes back.  I'm sorry.  Oh, shit.  But this golf thing is way more believable than that whole pool party.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you wanted to believe that.  Golf is something he can prove, though.  Yes, yes.  He's not going to shoot a 79.  I think we should have a golf outing. 
[01:13:30]  I'm down.  All of us will go golfing.  Let's go Saturday.  That would be great.  He'll shoot in the 80s easily, but a 7 handicap would mean 79.  Let's go Saturday.  Let's do it.  Wow.  $1,000 bet.  $1,000 bet.  $1,000.  If he's lying, it'll be exactly like Ralph wanting to golf with Mr. Marshall, and he doesn't  know how to golf, and he's got to learn.  You're going to have your fucking foot on a pot, hitting a pin cushion around.  What's the risk to you?  What do I get if you don't shoot a 79 or better? 
[01:14:00]  Well, you get a nice free round of golf.  I could do that anywhere.  Well, you know what?  We got fans all over the fucking place.  It's a nice club.  I don't want to play on the public range.  I can't.  I won't.  You think Ralph's like Milos?  Yes.  Where's your handicap online?  I don't really keep one online.  It's not even a real thing.  You can't prove it.  Because I...  What happened?  All my golf buddies checking in.  You can check a handicap online.  That's fine, yeah, but like... 
[01:14:30]  Are you part of a country club?  Oh, boy.  You don't have it registered at your country club?  No.  Falling apart.  Because there's no reason.  I don't find...  There's always a reason.  No, let me tell you why there's a reason.  If you're that damn good, you want other people to know, and that's why it would be online.  Then why don't I just...  Are you like Ty Webb?  If you're 28, you don't put that online.  You're like, oh, that's...  Why don't I just prove it, then?  Oh, you see, the proof's in the pudding.  How do you measure yourself against other golfers?  Iraq, your father is a big-time golfer.  Yeah.  His handicap is online.  It's registered everywhere.  And he's about a what? 
[01:15:00]  All the old people do that, really.  What, your father's handicap?  Wow.  His son.  We could figure it out without you saying it.  Of course.  You really make it hurt.  I know.  You really make it hurt.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  What's his handicap?  He's about a 10, I think.  No, he's lower than that.  He is, huh?  I think he's about a...  I think he's about a 6.  Jesus.  Ooh.  Yeah, Rob's not a 7.  That's fine.  My dad plays every day. 
[01:15:30]  That's his job.  How many times a week do you play, Rob?  Like three.  Three times a week, he's out there on the links.  He just lied there.  I know his line.  When he goes like this.  Yeah, that was a lie.  He does so much mouth, he goes like this.  He probably play once a week.  Okay.  Not three, though.  It's fine.  Are you talking mini golf?  He's talking ladies' tees.  I've done the...  Oh, ladies!  That windmill's tough.  Is it from the tips?  Yeah.  You play from the tips?  He doesn't play.  From the blacks.  From the blacks.  From the championship tees.  Championship tees.  Wow.  It's...  What do I get if you don't shoot a 79? 
[01:16:00]  A championship caliber!  What do I get?  What do you want?  Yeah.  I want to throw a party at his house.  Just invite homeless junkies, fucking rapists.  That's nice.  All the people from my videos.  If Rob doesn't shoot a 79, we get to do our next live broadcast from Rob's house.  Oh, man.  All those listeners.  You know we're talking to a 79.  All right.  Let's go.  Have you won any tournaments?  In high school, I came in, you know, top 10 a lot.  Top 10?  How many?  Are there even 10 people in the golf club in school? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  My team in high school, we placed second three years in a row in the state of New Jersey.  What happened?  You couldn't close the deal.  What happened?  There was another school better than us.  Oh, Rob.  What'd you shoot that day?  Don't let it hurt you.  Um, I don't know.  I forget.  It was.  How do you forget?  It was like five years ago.  But how do you forget?  I had.  If you're in a state thing, they have a press club or something.  Oh, I'm feeling a little weird here.  You better get back to making fun of Eric. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, whenever you start off-roading into real life, it just falls apart.  Off-roading again?  Ah, what happened?  You'd start bringing up your golf prowess and everybody's calling you a liar again.  Yeah, then the temptation to be the big shot comes in.  No, just keep doing what you're doing.  How about a few pictures?  Do you have any pictures anywhere of you golfing?  Throw them up.  Do you have a video of your swing?  Robert Bobbert.  Because it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing.  He's not a seven.  You don't think? 
[01:17:30]  Nah.  What do you think?  He's going to just suck?  If you're a seven and you belong to a club, that is posted somewhere.  Yeah.  Even if he was and he was trying to show off, wouldn't you lowball it?  What's your dad's handicap?  He's about like a 10, 12, right around there.  So you're better than your dad?  Yeah.  Whoa.  That must have been tough for him once you passed him by.  Yeah.  It's very tough for your dad.  It's like being better than your mentor.  You take gimme pots?  This was...  Darth Vader.  2008.  I had an 86. 
[01:18:00]  I didn't shoot too well that day.  86 is a 14.  Wait, what's that?  About a 14.  Is your name on there somewhere?  Yeah.  Right there.  Holy shit.  86.  I had 86.  Not great.  That's a 14.  That's four years ago.  That's four years ago.  I have no doubt he probably shoots in the 80s consistently, but I'm telling you, a 7 is...  That's in the 70s every time out.  Wow.  Jimmy's exploding over here.  My coach got his 800th win, and this is a course that they play on the PGA Tour on.  I shot a 38. 
[01:18:30]  38?  What?  Out of nine.  All right.  On a nine.  That's a 76.  76.  Rob led the way.  Oh.  Wow.  Look at this.  Rob led the way.  Rob led the way.  He's funny with costumes.  Holy shit.  This kid plays golf.  He does it all.  He plays golf well.  Wow.  Now 38's impressive.  You know, he fucking...  I'm getting a little nervous.  He's proving something here.  I'm a little nervous.  He's proving something here.  Iraq, comment.  Iraq, what do you think?  Well, why wouldn't you have your handicap online or anywhere?  Because it's like... 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  Go get her.  I just get lazy, and I don't want to put it on.  It's like...  I like to play for fun, but I'm good, I guess.  If that makes sense.  Yeah.  If you're part of a country club, you always register your score.  No.  How do you know?  Are you in a country club?  You don't have to do that.  But I think if you play that much, you'd want to.  And if you're that good, that's what's strange.  I have no...  If you're a shitty, like, 25 handicap, who cares?  I get it, but not if you're shooting in the 70s consistently.  You want people to see that shit. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  I don't need to, like, do it.  We all have dumb egos.  Look, he's all zen-like.  I don't need...  No, Rob, you're...  He's not competitive, because his mom does everything for him.  Oh.  See?  Did Iraq say that?  Yeah, credit to Iraq on that one.  Oh.  I'll give you that.  Iraq?  You got that.  What else you got?  I'll give you that one.  What else you got?  He's looking up something else here.  He's got statistics.  He does.  He's coming with...  You are the NNJIL lead champs.  I now believe that you're good at golf. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Man, oh man.  My problem is with the 70 handicap.  It could happen.  The 70 handicap.  Yeah.  It could definitely be, though, right?  That's fine.  I mean, we'll just have to go play.  Whoa.  What do I get?  You get to...  I can get free golf anytime I want.  You can...  At the Bushwood, though?  That's crazy.  With this fucking country club.  Hmm.  What I...  I don't know.  This guy says you're lying about your handicap, and he can prove it.  Let me go to Jim in Jersey, because I'm having a tough time with this one. 
[01:20:30]  Jim.  Hey, Tim.  Tim, what's up, buddy?  Hey, yeah.  I'm a golf pro, and basically, if you're a 7 handicap, the way the handicap system works  without completely boring you guys is it's a collection of your 10 of your last 20 scores.  So, if he's a 7, that means his potential is at a 7, but most of the time, he's not going  to be a 7.  Yeah, but it could be a 7 handicap.  I think you're nitpicking here.  That's pretty fucking good.  He certainly could, and that is good. 
[01:21:00]  So, you take a par 72, 7 over par, and that's a 79.  You're going to have to play pretty well to do that.  Right.  And the other thing you said about the high school tournaments coming in the top 10 every  week, high school tournaments in New Jersey are match play.  You play against another team.  There's not even, it's not stroke play.  It is stroke play, idiot.  Oh!  Yes!  I played four years of it, I know.  You count up all four, the highest four scores, and those...  You're playing against 12 guys, and you're coming in the top 10.  You're playing against six guys. 
[01:21:30]  Six guys on a team, and there's two teams.  12 guys, eight scores count.  It's not each score counts.  It's the top four scores count.  You add all those up, and then whoever has the lowest score out of that wins.  That's not called match play.  That's stroke play.  Ooh!  You don't play, but it's a match against another team.  If you're not competing against...  Yeah, obviously it's a match against another team.  I mean, it's like, oh, I have a match against...  In tennis, I have a match against them.  But you're not saying, oh, I'm going to win.  There's no hit.  Uh, yeah, well, not really, because there's no handicaps in tennis. 
[01:22:00]  You know if you can play against anyone.  But we're not playing a handicap in high school golf.  We play straight up.  I understand that.  But saying you're coming to top 10 every week doesn't mean shit, because there's only 12 people playing.  But that doesn't...  How does that matter?  Are you suspicious this kid doesn't have his handicap online anywhere there, Tim?  I gotta be honest.  Every club has a computer system.  They have handicaps, and you do want to track that in case you get invited to a hoity-toity member guest.  Like, uh, it comes like you made from time to time.  You want to have some kind of proof of your handicap so you can play in the official tournament. 
[01:22:30]  Especially if you're about a seven.  You want people to know that shit.  We all have dopey egos that need...  Well, a seven handicap, like, what does a guy like Tiger Woods consider?  I mean, obviously...  Oh, he's scratched.  He's like a plus five.  Plus four, plus three.  Yeah, he's...  He's under.  Yeah, it's completely different.  What's a scratch mean?  I mean...  You're shooting even par every time.  Even par, but he's shooting under par all the time, so...  But again, again, it's a question...  Is he really a plus five?  You have to play well.  You have to play well.  Plus five means he's shooting five under every fucking round out. 
[01:23:00]  Averaging that.  I'm scratch.  Yeah.  I believe it.  Yeah, I'm itchy.  Double bogey!  All right, Tim.  Tim's out.  I don't understand that.  That's a golf term.  Why would you say that?  Shut up.  Yeah, there's more weirdness in the studio.  Now we learn the kid is really good at golf, but doesn't want to prove it to anybody.  That's strange.  I said I'd prove it.  I said I'd play.  I'd say that he's convinced me, though.  He's going to prove it. 
[01:23:30]  The 38 convinced me is really impressive, but he's got to do that almost every time out.  And he just shut this guy down.  Again, he's probably a 10 or 11.  Very informed.  Everyone squeezes a few strokes in.  Let's play.  Please.  I would love to.  He's luring you into hanging out with me.  He's begging to play.  It would just be.  Oh, you're actually luring you into hanging out with him.  But you know what?  These two hanging out on the course.  I'm going to be honest.  I'm not even kidding here.  I could absolutely see these two, like, getting along playing golf.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  I suck at it, but I love it.  A couple of buddy scoff. 
[01:24:00]  He might even fix my swing.  You know what?  It just would be one of those things.  It would be kind of cool.  But I need something.  I mean, if I'm offering $1,000, if you shoot under fucking 80, what do I get?  Pool party?  Yeah.  Pool party.  My house.  That'd be cool.  You can invite anybody you want.  I'm going to invite AIDS.  Roll your fucking skin.  Now I've got to invite my father-in-law and my brother.  Cool.  You don't get to bring anybody.  Whoa.  Three spots for me, one spot for you. 
[01:24:30]  There's our foursome.  I'm sorry, James.  And will it be at your country club?  Yeah, sure.  And you pay for everything.  Food, beers.  Jesus.  He's an intern.  And we love drinking when we play golf.  He's going to nagle that bitch.  Yeah, he's going to nagle out.  I think that's a great thing for the show, though.  If he plays golf with you.  And I want a caddy.  Don't you think it would be fun if we all went and played nine holes?  No.  I don't play golf anymore.  Exactly.  That's why it would be fun.  Francis wants to play golf.  I would try it with the show.  It would be a blast if all of us did it.  Travis, it's pretty uncomfortable.  You're trying to hone your way in on their friendship like this. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I know.  I'm really not feeling it.  I'm lonely.  Exactly.  I-Rock, oh.  Oh.  Your hero.  I-Rock, I love this kid.  Your worst enemy.  This is terrible.  This is comic book shit.  He comes in in a piggy outfit and winds up bonding with the boss.  I love this kid.  They have a golf outing plan.  I do have demands.  My father-in-law, my brother.  Okay.  Me, you.  That's fine, I guess.  We all need caddies that you're paying for.  Beer, food.  I need brand new golf balls.  You'll get nothing and like it. 
[01:25:30]  Not just a sleeve.  I want a box of golf balls for me, my father-in-law, and my brother.  Some of them naked lady tees.  A couple of those.  One of these.  To be honest with you, I might need a new putter.  Jesus.  If you win.  I'm not going to win.  No, no, no.  The bet.  Oh, yeah.  If you win the bet, he pays for that stuff.  That's a good-  He will absolutely kick my ass on a golf course.  I have no doubt.  How do you know?  No, with the stats at 38 and all that.  He might get a little fucking flustered playing with you.  Not even a chance. 
[01:26:00]  But he's not going to break 80.  Okay.  He absolutely won't break 80 on his home course.  I'll even give him his home course.  I don't care.  Do you want four caddy?  Like, to be four caddy?  Like, we both have carts, and then we go out?  Or do you want-  I want two caddies.  My own fucking caddy that I can talk to.  Oh, you want the guy, hey, yeah, this one's a-  Yeah.  And I will walk with my caddy.  That's fine.  That cart shit.  Great Saturday.  Where one guy, like-  You tell intern Rob I'm gunning for him. 
[01:26:30]  I want to be set up all nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I can't believe he just stole Opie from E-Rock.  Let me tell you.  This is amazing.  He came in-  When we first went on the air, it was, fucking, this intern's going to come in with a dumb  bit, we're going to throw him out, end of story.  It ends with E-Rock looking like the piece of shit, and he's golfing with Opie.  Yeah.  It's fucking, it's amazing how this kid, you use, like, Jedi mind tricks.  You think Eric's been thinking for the last eight years, like, okay, eventually we're  going to play golf.  Like, it's just going to happen naturally. 
[01:27:00]  He's been trying to think of something other than just going over Opie's place or something.  Just some type of common activity they could have together.  He's actually been learning golf.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just so he could eventually.  Just so eventually.  And now, here's Rob.  Yeah, fucking upgrade.  Richard Marilyn, why do you get anything Opie?  You're the one that wants to do this.  Because that's what I do.  Right.  I'm in a situation that I can take advantage of now.  I'm going to take advantage of that.  Just no cargo shorts.  You know.  Oh, you want one of those places? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, man.  That's a new rule, because a lot of guys want to cargo shorts.  Because your club is that important?  I could wear cargo shorts when I'm playing Tiger Woods golf.  Well, guess what?  You're buying me fucking golf shorts.  Oh, man.  Fair is fair.  Fair is fair.  I don't want to go out.  Why don't they want cargo shorts?  Because that's what he's doing.  Because that's why it's trashy.  That's a nice place he goes to.  Yeah, it does look trashy.  It looks trashy.  You can hold a lot of good shit in your pockets.  You can.  You got people driving around the course making sure your shirt's tucked in. 
[01:28:00]  Not like shirts tucked in.  Your shirt's going to be tucked in to play golf now.  Make sure your dick isn't hanging out.  But, like, they have such stupid rules there.  Like, you can't change into your golf shoes out in the, like, near your car in the parking lot.  What?  It's ridiculous.  Because it probably puts a bunch of holes in the fucking parking lot.  It scratches everything.  What golf course?  White beaches.  White beaches.  Because the target's hot, and then you're putting holes in it.  You're right.  Yeah, the target's hot.  Let's take a look at the golf course.  A lot of parking lots are all fucked up.  What's the target? 
[01:28:30]  B-E.  What's that?  What did I do?  You said the target's hot.  What's the target?  Oh, the target's hot.  Oh, the target's hot.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The tar.  The target's hot.  I think you said the target's hot.  I'm like, what is that?  I'm going to just mull that together.  I'm sorry.  The target's hot.  So they don't want you putting holes.  That's how Roland would have said it.  The target's hot.  The target's hot.  The target's hot.  I might have hit my head yesterday.  That's nice.  I'm still not sure.  I went over at handlebars.  I was telling Anthony.  On a bike.  Nice.  And I really don't know what happened.  Stupid asshole cab opened his door as I was flying by. 
[01:29:00]  You were in the room.  You pay me for door.  I'm still shook up.  Did he apologize at least?  I was screaming.  Like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  I was out of my mind.  I got really scared.  He said he was sorry?  Yeah, the guy felt really bad.  But I'm like, are you from New York?  Because New Yorkers, you always look to see if anybody's coming.  I know.  And it's honestly, in the end, it was my fucking fault.  I know I should know better.  But I was flying.  And this guy opened up the cab door.  And I had to make a move. 
[01:29:30]  So I jammed on both fucking handbrakes and went flying.  Clubhouse dress code.  I'm still all shook up.  Yeah, it scares me.  I'm all shook up.  You know what I fucked up?  My taint.  Oh.  My taint hit the top of the handlebars.  Yeah.  And then the pain shot through my pee hole.  A little salve rub on your taint?  All right.  If you want to, Jimmy.  Go for it.  Here's the golf course, though.  Golf course.  All right.  Dress code for clubhouse.  Dress code for clubhouse.  Yeah, look at that. 
[01:30:00]  This is golf dress code.  Golf dress code.  I'm going to be living the dream, man.  This is fucking real.  And there's a pool there, too.  It says casual attire is permitted.  Do they allow pig suits?  Ah.  I'm not sure.  No nagling allowed on the course.  Yeah, this looks like a nice place.  That looks pretty fucking nice, right?  And you go there a lot?  Yeah.  Are you a member, or is it like your dad's a member, so you're able to go?  Did anyone else hear the lie?  Did anyone else hear the lie?  Sorry to interrupt. 
[01:30:30]  Because there's a golf course.  You went from three days a week to one day a week.  Because there's a golf course.  Why would you play at your course?  Because there's a golf course two minutes away from my house that's walking distance that  I go to also.  Oh, why go?  But why play at your country club?  Because it's so close and it's free.  I just get walk on.  I'll give him that.  I'll give him that.  You can't give him that.  Every time you go here, you have to pay like 40 bucks at least.  This kid shoots in the low 80s, and he plays once a week, maybe.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Someone on Twitter is not happy.  Can that shit dick Sam shut the fuck up? 
[01:31:00]  We don't need to be explained five times.  That's unnecessary.  Wow.  I don't know why they have a problem.  That's just because they've been listening since six o'clock doesn't mean everybody has  radio one-on-one, mister.  One-on-one?  One-on-one.  One-on-one.  One-on-one.  You did suck.  You passed.  Radio one-on-one.  What are we playing?  Hoops?  Yeah, what do you call meadowlark have?  What a surprise.  A listener has a problem with something we're doing.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  Very surprised when that happens.  This is great, man.  See?  This is great.  I mean, you two, I think, really would have fun.  And I'm not even kidding.  No, I think we would, too.  I think that common golf thing.  Relax about you think we're going to have fun.  Holy shit.  I could say that.  This kid.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Imagine that.  That's like Gary.  You know what stupid Gary goes?  I like to have a good time.  You know, I think me and Oprah get along.  We think a lot alike.  Do we really?  When did he say that?  Oh, God.  It comes back to me. 
[01:32:00]  Who do you say it to?  You know, we're very alike in the way we think about stuff.  I think, actually, in another world, we'd get along.  Who do you say that to?  I can't fucking blow up someone's spot.  Robert would be, like, out with his friends or something.  This is, like, a couple months from now.  Rob would be out with one of his friends and grab his phone and just be like, hold on.  Yeah, oh.  What's up, man?  Oh, it's going to be great.  These girls don't believe I know you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's me.  We're friends.  Yeah, we're fucking pals.  We're golfing tomorrow.  And look, man, I'll fucking take advantage of a kid for free golf. 
[01:32:30]  Sure.  No problem.  Sure.  Get him in a clubhouse.  But I come with people.  My own people.  Let me see your putter.  Yeah, a little piggy nose.  Oinky, oinky.  I spell it with D's.  A putter.  Yeah.  I'll get in there and I'll search your greens real deep.  Do I have to replace my own divots?  It's in the hole.  I mean, no.  If we have caddies, no.  All right, good.  Let me clean out your sand trap with my tongue.  That's disgusting.  Probably. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Well, that's fucking, that worked out very well.  Rob, I'm very surprised.  Can we call your dad?  Right now?  Oh boy, here it is.  Right now?  No, he's up.  He's probably at work.  All right, put him on speakerphone.  How come we couldn't talk to his parents when you were talking about the pool party?  Because it was a big lie.  The pool party was a lie.  Pretty much.  Yeah, but I don't even know if I believe that.  That's the weird, that's the weirdness thing I got.  Yeah.  What do you want to talk about?  Like, so I can tell him.  Oh, what are you going to fucking pre-interview the guy?  Just tell me he's on the air. 
[01:33:30]  Yes, you're on the air.  We want to talk about something.  You want to call him from the phone phone?  It would be better to call him from in there.  Yeah.  Call him from inside.  Go call him.  Call him from inside.  Get all this on-air shit straightened out.  How old's your dad?  And then we'll just plunk him down.  You broke a headphone.  53, I think.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  I think the same thing.  I think the same thing.  I'm like, oh, God.  I'm going to try to convince myself I'm younger than I am.  That's good.  Then you hear the age, you're like, oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Jay Moores.  He's on Iron Man. 
[01:34:00]  Again?  Yeah.  Is that a repeat?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Best of Iron Man is in the corner.  Oh, best of Iron Man.  Best of Iron Man.  My handicap is not even worth talking about.  I'm not even.  I'm shooting in the mid-90s these days.  I stink.  That's terrible.  Oh, jeez.  And that is completely real.  Yeah.  Not padded.  What's the biggest issue?  I'm scratch plus, too.  My biggest issue, my...  No one gives a fuck about this part.  Yeah, I'm curious.  My irons have just gone away. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know why.  Really?  You can't?  I can't fucking hit an iron at all.  My woods are beautiful.  My putting's beautiful.  And I can even get it out of the trap pretty good.  You'd be good on my...  But a dumb iron shot, I can't fucking hit it straight anymore.  Mine are really good.  Oh, yeah?  I shoot like right under.  They're like, it's a 65.  I'm like, all right, I'll give you a 61.  Boom.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  I'm in Augusta.  I go play there a lot.  You know what's funny?  Yeah, everything I say.  No. 
[01:35:00]  Every shot you make is a chip shot.  Oh, you're too much.  I'm telling you.  Opie and Anthony golf outing?  We were actually all waiting.  That would have been perfect.  That would be fun.  What?  Opie and Anthony golf outing.  You don't get to go with Opie and Rob Travis.  No, we would all go.  Get over it.  Get Voss to go.  Yeah, why don't you stop trying to get golf yourself, you cocksucker.  That makes no sense, Chip.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, whoa.  Yeah, go have some orange juice or something.  That's Sam's orange juice.  My orange juice.  Exactly, motherfucker.  You can offer it to nobody.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, the piggy's back.  Left the room for a second.  He's right here.  Oh, now Travis shitting.  Oh, no.  All right, here's Rob's dad.  It's all in good fun.  All right.  Hey, Rob's dad is on the phone.  Hi, Rob's dad.  Hi, Rob's dad.  You're on with Opie and Anthony and the great Jim Norton, who was on Jimmy Fallon last night.  Wow, I hear so much.  So many good things about you guys.  Oh, good.  Hey, did you know about this pool party? 
[01:36:00]  Well, let's put it this way.  I heard about it from Rob.  He created the invites, I believe.  Ah.  And he was very excited about the opportunity of everybody coming over and him hosting something.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  What went wrong?  I don't know.  We've got to ask Rob.  Yeah, we tried.  We tried for two and a half hours.  Was there going to be a pool party?  Well, I think there was.  I think he wanted to have everybody over and, you know, have a nice luncheon and whatever 
[01:36:30]  it would have been.  Luncheon.  A luncheon.  I like that.  A luncheon.  That's great.  I love this guy.  What a great dad.  That's a nice guy.  A luncheon.  We tried.  It was going to be a cake party.  Yeah, something.  Did you say there's no way you're going to throw a pool party at my beautiful house?  I never said that.  Okay.  We would have done it.  Are you very proud of your boy?  Absolutely.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  That's good.  But I've got to tell you one thing.  Yeah.  When you really think of a kid that age waking up at 4.45 every morning, getting outside 
[01:37:00]  the house and excited to be there, I give him a lot of credit and I think a lot has  to do with his happiness and working with you guys.  Wow.  Wow.  You're like a real dad.  He's like a coach, right?  God, a real dad.  That's got to be amazing.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  You ever see him tear up a little and call him pissy eyes?  Nothing like that?  Hey, knock off with the pissy eyes.  Once in a while.  Oh, okay.  He's a good kid.  He's a good kid.  Now, you guys play golf a lot, right? 
[01:37:30]  We do.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How many times a week does Rob play golf?  Well, he tries to get out at least once or twice if he can.  All right.  I said once.  So, okay.  He doesn't play three times a week, right?  No, not as much as you do.  Oh, Rob.  I do play three times a week.  On the way.  He said three times a week.  I get out.  Hey, Rob, you know, I don't keep track of your calendar, young man.  And he says he likes playing at a golf course two minutes away because it's a lot easier  than going to the country club that you belong to. 
[01:38:00]  Is that right?  It is.  That's for sure.  Okay.  Now, would you consider Rob a better golfer than you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  What's your handicap, sir?  I'm probably about a 12 or 13.  He's probably about an eight or nine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I said seven.  He said a seven.  But that's the key to the bet.  I said everyone pads their handicap.  He's telling everyone he's a seven.  You know what that means. 
[01:38:30]  That means he's shooting in the 70s consistently.  And I said, no way.  He's probably shooting in the low 80s consistently.  That's a big difference.  Oh.  So I got a $1,000 bet with your son.  He doesn't have to pay me.  It's because he's going to take care of everything on the golf course.  Going golfing on Saturday at the club.  All right.  Oh, that's great.  But if he shoots lower than an 80, I'm going to hand over $1,000 cash.  You think he can do it?  You know what? 
[01:39:00]  I think he can.  Rob's dad calls that chump change, Hopi.  I'll be careful.  I'll be careful with that bet.  Oh, why?  You think he's going to be able to do it?  It's just mere pocket change to me.  And he's like, well, so am I.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck Rob.  Want to go on my yacht?  Everybody's a millionaire.  Oh, shit.  Shut up.  No, I don't even know how much.  Wow.  You know, this is great.  He sounds like a very nice guy there, Rob.  But do you hear what's going on here?  It's exactly what I said. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  A seven is that when someone says they're a seven, that means they're like Rob's father saying,  an eight or a nine.  I didn't think he was a 20 handicap.  But that's a big difference.  Sure.  Because Rob said you're a 10.  Yeah.  Somewhere in that area.  That's what they'll say about me.  I know.  A 10.  All right.  Well.  All right, guys.  Oh, yeah.  He said time is money.  You're done.  You're done with our money.  This guy's got to go off to do some insurance stuff.  I'm on my way to visit a client. 
[01:40:00]  Ah, client.  All right.  One more question.  What day did you move your son back into the hometown?  You're talking about from school?  James.  No, James.  From Montclair.  What day did you move him?  Oh, it was last Saturday.  Oh, Saturday.  The day that was supposed to be the party.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  And he would have hosted the party and had that, but, you know, he didn't have it, so  he helped his big brother out. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.  We're a good family.  Oh, you are.  Really?  Yeah.  You guys are perfect.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you guys like to clean this or something?  Are you a fan of perfect families, Anthony?  Just like the Lutz family.  Or the DeFeos, damn it.  I don't care.  I knew what you meant.  Either one.  Yeah.  Bad boy Ronnie DeFeo.  George Lutz.  Oh, boy.  You're a bad boy.  That perfect house.  Yeah.  It was all fun and games until Ronnie came home with a shotgun for no reason. 
[01:41:00]  He said, the devil's here.  Right.  All right, Mr. Rob's dad.  What's your name, sir?  All right, guys.  Take care of yourself.  John.  John.  Thank you, John.  Thank you, John.  Bye, Pops.  Your son's a little weird, but he's a good kid.  All right.  We love him.  He comes from good stock.  Good stock.  Yes.  Good stock.  Yeah.  We think he exaggerates a little bit, but besides that, he seems all right.  Turn about his fair play.  I like this kid.  It makes sense, Chip.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:41:30]  Would you let John go?  He's a busy man.  Bye, Pops.  What do you do for a living, John?  He's insurance.  I'm an insurance broker.  All right.  So you didn't lie about that either.  Damn it.  A few of the lies are not lies anymore.  Insurance broker?  How come he's not fixing it?  All right, John.  Thank you, sir.  There goes John.  I'm just getting started.  Wow.  E-Rock, you want a caddy for us?  Oh.  That would be great.  Oh, God.  E-Rock, you want a caddy?  That'd be huge.  No, I'm busy.  Do what?  Whatever. 
[01:42:00]  Ah, whatever.  Oh, he got me on that one.  He does not want a caddy for you guys.  E-Rock lost all his energy.  He's now slumped on the couch.  He's sitting on the couch now.  And now while the young, eager piggy boy is standing up and hitting home runs on the phone,  Eric's probably been up for almost 12 hours.  That's not nice.  Another jab from Travis.  Oh, yeah.  Travis is really giving E-Rock their business today.  Turn about to start a play.  All right, so you're about to say that.  Don't make no sense.  He's about a 10 handicap.  He shoots 82 at 10.  Okay.  But he still says, regardless of what his handicap is, that he's going to be able to shoot. 
[01:42:30]  But if he's a 10, there is a very good possibility he could break 80.  There's a chance he could break 80.  What if it is 80?  He's fucked.  Yeah.  Just like the height thing.  I got you.  I said a smidge under 5'5".  I won that bet.  He won.  He won that one too.  He won, yeah.  I haven't won a bet in a while now.  How did all this Monopoly get out of the floor?  Oh, he was throwing it around.  They put it up.  Back to E-Rock. 
[01:43:00]  E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  He's just bashing you.  You all right with that, E-Rock?  Oh, it's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Oh, no.  He's really just hammering you, having fun.  Oh, and then he says, I'm sorry, because now he's feeling bad for you.  He pities you.  Oh.  Can we go to break?  Jesus.  Man.  Well, Sam, you were completely wrong.  I'm happy I was wrong.  It did not stop the flow of the show.  Yeah.  Amazing, right?  It didn't stop the show in its tracks.  It would be golfing.  That's great.  Some would say it did, by the way.  They're fucking wrong if they said that. 
[01:43:30]  You think they are?  Yes.  Anybody who said that this was not...  First of all, we spent...  Rob has provided us with now two two-hour first breaks this week alone.  And anybody who thinks they've been bad radio should just never listen to this show or any  show ever again.  Tune out.  But they must be right if they're saying it.  They're wrong.  You sure they're wrong?  Always wrong.  And not only are they wrong about this, they're wrong about everything in their lives.  And they usually are.  Yeah.  Because they're stupid.  They're stupid people.  If they didn't like...  If they... 
[01:44:00]  Anybody who didn't like the last two hours of radio is a stupid person.  But those people make me question myself.  You shouldn't question yourself.  Oh, okay.  They're very stupid.  Thank you, Rob.  Dressed as E-Rock.  No problem.  As a pig.  You should oink your way out of here or something.  E-Rock.  Insult it.  E-Rock, that's the last word.  Last word before break, E-Rock?  I'm good.  Go to break.  Oh, God.  Come on, E-Rock.  What is that?  What is that?  Come on. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  Never going to golf with Opie like that.  He doesn't play golf.  Yeah.  What are you doing, Rob?  You don't have to clean that stuff up.  Let somebody else do it.  You want Eric to clean it up?  Come on, E-Rock.  Give him the last word.  What happened?  Why lose the energy like that?  I don't...  Oh, don't say you don't care because you're getting very upset.  You do care a little.  Yeah.  There's not much I can do with two days left.  Two days left still makes a statement.  Yeah.  Put that bitch out on the street. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Rob made a statement.  Just make sure I get his phone number before he leaves.  Come on.  Oh, man.  Kick him to the curb your enthusiasm.  Rob, it's Greg.  How you doing, man?  Yeah.  Oh, fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Golf this Saturday.  Looking forward to it.  Looking forward to it.  Yeah.  Talking to Rob's dad.  Having fun.  Get his cell number and then fire him.  That'd be perfect.  Think about it.  He had a pleasant interaction with his family.  Oh, man.  Hey.  We're playing golf.  Hey.  Don't you bring the yellow shirt.  Hey.  Oh, my God. 
[01:45:30]  Opie's kid's like, Uncle Rob is here.  Oh, man.  E-Rock's been good to my kid.  Yeah.  He has been very good to my kid.  And that's the beauty of the kid looking forward to seeing Rob more.  Oh, man.  Like, E-Rock will be on the couch.  Your son will be talking to E-Rock and then Rob will come in and he'll go, yay.  Yay.  Run over and say hello.  And, like, E-Rock will try to, like, hold him there longer and he'll be going, eh, eh,  push away.  And E-Rock will just push.  You're a monster. 
[01:46:00]  You're a monster.  E-Rock will be trying to show all the gifts he bought.  What about all the gifts I just brought for you?  And Rob will be empty-handed.  Your gifts smell like duty.  He'll push them on the ground.  Wow, this kid made a huge comeback today.  Huge.  I've never seen anything like this before.  Rob will just bring him something like taffy and he'll love it.  Yay.  Best thing ever.  E-Rock will be like, look at the puzzle.  You all give gifts smell like duty.  Duty.  Does Rob's family have a boat? 
[01:46:30]  You must.  I'm sure they must.  That's hilarious.  Why isn't E-Rock smiling?  I don't know.  I know I can't be the only one that truly feels we should replace Sal with Rob.  Oh!  He just dumped water on me.  What the hell?  Why would you do that?  Oh, that's sexy.  Weird.  Why would you do that, E-Rock?  Physical today.  Yeah, he is.  Jimmy didn't do anything to you today.  Remember what Opie said.  He was the closest one.  He's lashing out. 
[01:47:00]  Use your words.  Yeah, use your words.  Use your words.  Use your words, E-Rock.  Use your words.  Don't wear people's pants.  I don't think anyone wants to hear that ever.  You can't dump water on people?  Yeah, you got to use your words.  Use your words.  Oh, boy.  Can you fire the kid?  I'd still enjoy it.  Can you?  Or officially resign as intern boss.  Don't be like, oh, I'm going to do another two days.  This is just sad.  Yeah, because for two days, we can figure something out.  Yeah.  We'll force Sam to do it, if that makes it easier for you. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, I mean.  Are you up for it?  If Eric quits, what can I do?  Intern boss for two days, if E-Rock quits right now?  If it's a sign to me, it's a sign to me.  Of course.  I'll take it on.  I want you to make drastic changes for the next two days.  I will.  The program will be completely different.  Make them dress in uniforms.  Absolutely.  There's a problem in the past couple semesters with the interns and their discipline.  Hey, hot, hype, hey, E-Rock.  Even the most successful intern was Sal, who now works here. 
[01:48:00]  He stinks, and he's still taking shots at Eric.  He's been taking shots at him instead of being on his side.  Sal, why do you stink now?  What happened?  I just had a couple duds in production.  I still work hard.  I do a lot of Eric's work behind the scenes.  See, he's taking shots again.  E-Rock, what do you think about it?  The comments?  Because we had nothing for him to do, so we gave him stuff, and then automatically you're  doing busy work.  Because creatively, he can't.  Sal, what do you do for E-Rock?  Troy doesn't let him do any production. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, man.  He hands it in.  He goes, this isn't good.  Why wouldn't Troy let him?  Troy's voguing in that room by himself.  Handsome.  If I were Troy, I'd let him do so much production, I'd just hand it in every day to us.  It'd be a goldmine of shit.  Troy's ashamed of it.  He is?  Yeah.  Wow.  Sal, what busy work do you do?  Troy, she'll let him do production.  You're right, Ant.  Oh, yeah.  We should hear a little more of that.  I do a lot of shows for the weekends.  I build Joe Rogan, the podcast, and stuff like that.  He makes it sound like it's a lot of... 
[01:49:00]  It's busy work.  Joe Rogan does the show.  What do you do?  Press a button?  He's just putting sweepers at the beginning and the end of it.  Oh, great.  Right, but it was originally your job that you gave to me.  Oh, my God.  Yes, because it was created while I was here, and then when you showed up, we had nothing  for you to do.  So we're like, hey, let's just give that to Sal.  I did that when I was an intern.  Yeah, because you had nothing to do.  Eric, are you telling me you're delegating work to subordinates?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I get that.  Boy, it doesn't end, the abuse, though.  That's your job, though, to delegate work.  Yeah.  Sure. 
[01:49:30]  But, I mean, if I were the boss of the interns, there would be a severe discipline redux.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need that.  You know?  People are saying Sal sucks at phone screening as well.  He does?  I haven't screened the phones in months.  Probably because you suck, I guess.  That's not true, because Sal filled in a little bit yesterday, and feedback was saying,  why does your screener sound like he's dying?  Why would they say that?  I don't know what it meant, but I don't know what he was saying on the phones, either.  But I saw it three or four.  Why do you sound like you're dying, Sal?  I think I took three phone calls, Eric, so it was probably one of the interns. 
[01:50:00]  And they all sucked?  Oh, man.  Or maybe they heard your production.  That, too.  No, I had a couple of duds in production.  I had a couple of hits in production.  Wait, we only know of one.  What was your other dud?  What was the other one?  Well, the Uncle Paul you didn't like, Jim, because I put the stupid sound effects.  Oh, where he puts the stupid sound effects.  What's that?  I remembered.  We took them out.  Other ones did have sound effects.  No, he used really bad music.  Yeah, I just didn't like that one.  And let's not go crazy saying I've had a couple of hits.  I don't know that you've had any hits.  What hits have you had?  Yeah, what's your hit?  The Sick Fucking Puppies song was probably my biggest hit.  Done While You Were an Intern. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  But I didn't love that.  I didn't hate it.  Ah, yes.  I'll tell you why.  It was a little too fast.  Uh-huh.  But it was good for an intern.  Yeah, for an intern it was good.  Did you like the second Suckin' Puppies?  I don't remember the second one.  Igloo's Melting.  It's a good song.  Igloo's Melting.  Yeah, I wouldn't say any hits for Sal.  No hits.  Sal.  No hits.  No hits.  Have you had an idea for production and not done it because you're afraid now? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  See what this place does to you?  Since that Angry Panda one, dude, I am so scared of doing a production.  What was the idea of a production that you didn't do?  I went over with Troy the other day and Troy was like, nah, we've got to scrap it because  it was just shit.  But Sal, learn from Rob.  I know.  Look at the big comeback Rob made today.  You should come in here with a bouffant hairdo and drawing some tattoos and be like,  hey, everybody, I'm quanting it up.  You know?  Rob could have gave up.  Just throwing cum around.  Rob could have gave up. 
[01:51:30]  He came back strong.  Why don't you try another fucking production piece?  Yeah.  I have been trying.  I did a few.  Why would Troy talk you out of that?  What do you think?  We don't like the bad stuff?  I want to hear something.  Yeah, exactly.  Troy doesn't understand shit either.  The dice one I did?  Why wouldn't Troy encourage him to hand in production?  Maybe Troy should hand in the production that he said no to.  Oh, here comes.  Oh, that's Kenny.  Oh, boy.  The club soda.  It's like a bad odor just blew it.  Oh, shit.  I did the dice one from the other day when he was going on and on and on. 
[01:52:00]  Troy.  Oh, about the Bonnie thing?  That was you?  Yes.  But to be fair, the humor was in the content already.  It always is.  But who thought of the idea of having him rant like that and editing it?  It happened like that really on the show.  But to get that fast-paced kind of here's the content and then oh, oh, at the end we're  Oh, that piece was really funny.  Was that you?  Yes, that was me.  And then I gave it to Troy.  Troy approved it.  He did some tweaks to it.  And that was it.  Oh, the tweaks.  So was that Sal's piece, Troy? 
[01:52:30]  Pretty much.  He got some help.  And it was already the thing.  It was there.  Yeah, that's what happened.  That's what happened.  But that was a really funny piece.  We'll play it into break, by the way, Sal.  He got some help with the timing.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Because the timing was the biggest part of that.  I thought it was done very well, the timing.  Somebody helped him with the timing.  Oh, boy.  Troy.  I think Sal is going to do good.  Yeah, I mean, he is.  I mean, he's off to a good start.  Troy's such an optimist.  We're supposed to hire good people.  This is great.  We're not supposed to hire anyone that we're hoping might be good eventually. 
[01:53:00]  What the hell is that, school?  The thing with Sal is, sonically, he has a good ear.  He really does.  He knows.  Please don't ever use the word sonically.  Well, I mean, that's what it is.  That's what it is.  What does sonically mean?  It means everything in the production, all the sounds are sitting where they should be  sitting.  And it's EQ'd correctly.  Sonically.  Sonically.  How are you supposed to say that?  It's like daughterically.  I guess you did say it correctly.  Well, it's like Sonic the Hedgehog.  It just sounds shitty. 
[01:53:30]  That's definitely lying.  Shit radio coming in.  Oh, boy.  I'm still getting acquainted with what goes over well with the ONA show.  I mean, I think that takes time.  It takes time?  How long?  Jesus Christ.  It takes time.  Exactly.  The big hit in the last month was somebody fucking vomiting and then blowing their breath  in E-Rock's face.  It's hard to figure out.  Pig nose is destroyed here.  Yeah, pig nose.  Why did you break that?  That's a good nose.  I wasn't going to keep it. 
[01:54:00]  He's pissed at you.  You destroyed the cupcakes?  I wanted a fucking cupcake.  There's plenty more.  Troy.  Danny saved the whole tree.  Danny is the hero today.  Danny jumped on them like a fucking grenade being fucking numb.  He really did.  Troy, is there winners here today?  You've been listening, right?  Yeah.  Who are the winners?  Well, the winners, first of all, are all of us because we had breakfast.  The Egg McMuffins.  Egg McMuffins.  So we all win.  That's pretty good.  And E-Rock just walks away.  Where are you going?  I'm here.  But, uh, holy shit. 
[01:54:30]  E-Rock just walked out of the studio.  Did he just walk out?  And he seemed a little miffed.  What is he mad about?  He's going into the room that Rob's in.  Turn the mic on.  Oh, shit.  Turn the mic on.  Turn the mic on.  What's he doing?  Do you see him?  He's ignoring it.  Oh, he just turned the mic off.  Really?  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you keep the mic on?  Because now we get to...  You're going to need me there to drag this bit on more?  Eric's saying you guys are done. 
[01:55:00]  Well, Eric knows, I guess.  I guess Eric is, uh...  I think the listeners are the winners, too.  Yeah, who are the winners today, Troy?  We all win for getting breakfast, but E-Rock doesn't win because he did not have breakfast.  He was eyeing it up, though.  And the smell is killing him.  Oh, it had to work.  They smell great.  Yeah.  Who else are...  Well, the MVP award goes to Rob.  Hands down.  That's a huge comeback.  Amazing comeback right there.  Amazing.  Holy fuck.  I'm excited to see what he has planned next for tomorrow.  This kid's just a fucking... 
[01:55:30]  He's on fire.  ...a cavalcade of entertainment.  He is.  A smorgas about cornucopia of fucking bits.  Yeah, he's great.  Thank God we have him this semester.  Yeah.  He's given us a lot of good radio.  A gift.  Yeah, he's a gift.  Did he make a video of his golf swing hitting some golf balls for tomorrow?  That's a good idea.  Yeah.  Let's see it.  I want to make sure my thousand is safe.  I don't know.  You might be fucked on this one.  It's going to be close.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, huh?  Yes.  We have Dan Soters here today. 
[01:56:00]  He's Bobby's on-air partner.  You know Dan, right?  I've done radio with Dan Soters.  Oh, you have?  He's fun, man.  He does that giant voice I love.  I don't know that.  He's done the giant voice.  We'll have him do the giantism of what it's called.  Yeah.  Bug one?  Yeah.  He does that very well.  Funny guy.  I like Dan.  I didn't know you guys.  I forgot you guys know.  Oh, yeah.  I did the podcast with Dan and Bobby and Joe DeRosa before.  Bobby, I called yesterday.  Before those two broke up.  Is DeRosa not doing it anymore?  Yeah.  They don't like each other.  As far as podcast shit goes.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  What? 
[01:56:30]  I think they're still cordial to each other, but.  What?  Ah.  Well, let's get the fucking skinny.  There's a major problem.  You hear that?  Dan Soter next.  Soter?  Soter.  Soter.  Soter.  It sounds like you're saying it wrong, but it's Soter.  It sounds like it should be Soter, but it's Soter.  That just brought back my Long Island accent.  If he was a dad, Soter Pop.  Yeah.  What if he's not a dad, you conksucker?  On Long Island, you say Soter sometimes.  Soter.  Instead of Soda.  All right. 
[01:57:00]  E-Rock, if you will.  Thank you, sir.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going this motherfucker, Fran Suck Dick, I call her.  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's like jumping in there.  I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over.  And this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking truck driver is giving me the fingers. 
[01:57:30]  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics.  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do.  And she's fucking awful.  And I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me.  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking baby you have rather than trying out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck.  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her. 
[01:58:00]  She's joking.  That's not real.  Oh, then my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dyson.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  I sure hope you can repurpose this.  Are you going to repurpose a repurposed bit?  Or us discussing repurposed?  That would be some weird matrix shit.  I'm purposed. 
[01:58:30]  Repurposed.  Nice.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  What does that mean?  A new purpose?  But a repurpose means you're purposing it again.  If repurpose has a new purpose to what?  Originally had a different purpose.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Wait.  All right.  Let's break it down. 
[01:59:00]  Re-use.  So you use something and then you reuse it.  So it's not a new purpose.  You're using it for the same shit.  Purpose is sounding weird now.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Purposed.  Purposed.  Repurposed.  Nice.  Weird matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird matrix shit.  A new purpose.  Weird matrix shit.  We're taking audio that at one point had a purpose and adding a new purpose to the same audio. 
[01:59:30]  Now we're repurposing that same audio as to be a song.  Well, there you go.  There's the repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  Repurpose.  The O.P.  Anthony Show.  And another thing about handicaps.  Fairway and greens, Ant.  Really fast on the Twitter.  We're going back and forth a little bit with some DMs because he writes, dude, a good golfer  will pad their handicap with a higher number, not a lower one to suck someone into a bet. 
[02:00:00]  That means he could be a five or a six.  I completely agree with what this guy is saying because that absolutely happens.  Yeah.  When you're at a golf course and someone asks you're handicapped, you're always going to pad it a little higher just in case you do bet, right?  But what I wrote back to this guy was, that's all true, but he wanted to brag knowing that most likely we would never play.  Like most likely people aren't going to his party.  Right.  Same kind of story.  So, you know, he wanted to show how good he was and a 10's good, but a seven's even better if you're going to brag about it. 
[02:00:30]  That's my thought on that anyway.  You guys play golf and see what happens.  Dan Soder is here.  Yeah.  Bring him on in.  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.  Bring him on in.  Who's that girl wiggling around like that?  Hey, Dan!  Who is that girl?  It's been a while.  What's up, man?  What's going on?  It's been a while.  You just saw that girl walking?  Yeah.  Who is that?  Who is that? 
[02:01:00]  She's an intern, I think.  Really?  Yeah, we can't.  How can we get those fucking interns?  Are we allowed to hit her?  We can't even touch her or talk to her.  Can't you dress like a pig and come in?  Is that your one or mine?  You think that would be a problem?  Yeah.  Probably.  Could you dress like a piggy and I'm going to fucking just feel your tits?  Just give her a box with a pig suit in it?  Yeah.  Let's go put that on.  Yeah, put this on.  We have the asshole cut out.  We're going to put fingers in between our pigtails.  Do I have to do this?  Yes.  Yeah, it's part of the hazing.  No, it's sad. 
[02:01:30]  As funny as that is, Jimmy, we would have done that in the past.  Yeah.  For real.  So you're saying I showed up in the twilight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've already, it's the roller coaster, the part of the ride that just comes back where you  get off.  That's where we are right now.  The.  The break part.  Where you lock eyes with a meth addict that just put together the coaster.  Exactly.  There are so many ways to get fired.  It's amazing.  Like, you never see it coming.  It's always something you do.  Yeah.  Well, you're not like, ah, this is just a regular bit. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But it's the one thing, it's the one little thing.  Like, you touched her when she had the pig suit on.  Oh, yeah.  That happened.  It's amazing we haven't been fired again.  That's why when these mics are off, I don't talk to any of these people in the hallways.  I just don't, because you never know.  You just never know.  I just threaten them with sexual fucking harassment.  Yeah.  Go around there just fucking grabbing handfuls of pussy down the hallway.  I love it.  It's funny.  You just smack it.  You go, slap, slap, slap.  Nice puffy box.  Oh, they laugh.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, when they're bending over at the filing cabinet, you just grab the fat lips, and  you say, stand here.  Hold on, get your camera.  Everybody fucking...  The funniest part about the filing cabinet.  Yeah.  What fucking year is this?  That's right.  Exactly.  The filing cabinet.  Can you file these papers that we have?  I love when she's on the dictation machine.  I couldn't improv a quick reason to bend over, so I figured filing cabinet's the old standby  for bending over.  Did you say dictation machine?  Yes.  Red Peters?  Dictation...  Oh, God, right?  You got that, E-Rock. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, God.  What was that, Blow Me?  Was that the famous Blow Me song?  Yes.  Was it?  Oh, How's Your Dick?  How's Your Hole.  How's Your Hole?  Oh, that was it.  Oh, E-Rock said it's How's Your Dick.  Yeah, How's Your Hole.  How's Your Hole family.  Can we play this for a second?  Let Dan settle in.  You want to hear a really hacky song parody?  I would love to.  That we used to play.  In the day...  We did play this a few times.  Times changed.  Yeah, we did.  Well, here it is. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, God.  This was a massive hit for Red Peters.  No, no, don't say that.  Wait.  Oh.  Oh, I see what he did.  Terrible.  He's talking about holes.  It's called a workaround.  How's your hole.  How's your hole.  How's your hole.  Oh, my God.  How many times do they say the same joke?  Not enough, Jimmy.  It's literally like saying two Jews walking over.  They own it.  They own it.  We heard you.  He's setting up the bid. 
[02:04:00]  Here we go.  Now you get the bid.  Oh, now he's got something different.  How's your dick?  How's your dick?  Tation machine.  Oh.  This is crazy.  He was probably so happy with himself when he wrote this.  He's dysfunctional.  Yeah.  Let's see what he comes up with next.  I love that it says now a ringtone.  To the cleaners today, take your hands down.  Take your hands down.  To the cleaners today, take your hands down. 
[02:04:30]  How's your cunt?  To the cleaners.  Trees foreign policy.  How's your cunt?  Trees foreign policy.  If it's just how's your cunt, and by that I mean your wife.  How's your cunt?  Completely went off the deep end.  This stinks.  Isn't this great?  No.  This is horrible.  Oh, and then a twangy fucking cunt.  And then a music interlude.  Yeah.  Yeah, real.  Oh, here we go.  Won't you do my ass?  Won't you do his ass?  Astrological chocolate.  Oh.  Wow, I thought he made an ass.  Woo! 
[02:05:00]  I say I hate that.  This is like shitty uncle humor.  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah, yeah.  You get fucking cornered at a barbecue, and you're like, oh.  Yeah.  You're going to keep going?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cocktail with me.  I'm going to stiff cock.  Stiff cock.  Cocktail with me.  Cock.  Stiff cock.  Who said suck on his cocktail?  Yeah, now he's stretching it a little bit.  Suck on a stiff cocktail with me.  Yeah.  He's running out of gas.  Yeah, he really is.  Oh, I don't think.  Here it is.  Here comes the big finish.  The finale has. 
[02:05:30]  I would say.  Be more funny.  No.  How's your home?  Yeah.  This would get like.  Woo!  Woo!  The middle of the song of the boss.  Like Barry Madelow used to get.  He fucking brought it back.  Yeah!  I didn't think he was going to do it again.  Oh, it's fucking brilliant.  I believe I'll lose your whole family.  Dan, we missed out, though.  We could have been represented by the same guy that represented Red Peters.  Do you know Red Peters?  I got a deal for you. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  No, his manager wanted us.  Did he really?  Oh, yeah.  He was the worst manager in the world.  He tried to force us to sign a contract in a food court in Boston.  I think we'd have just gotten out of it this year.  Yeah.  He had muscle with him, too.  Did he really?  A big black guy.  Oh, that's fucking great.  And they're very scary.  It was a very scary situation.  He wanted us to sign this thing in a food court.  He told we were weak.  How was your...  Was he wearing a suit?  Yeah.  In my head, he's wearing a suit.  Yeah.  Well, his claim to fame is that he represented Bozo, the clown. 
[02:06:30]  Not the Bozo, the clown.  No.  The one that came after the real Bozo, the clown.  A replacement Bozo.  And you know that song?  How's it go again?  Na, na, na, na.  Remember that story?  Hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah.  You know the name of that band?  No.  I know the song.  I don't know the name of the band.  Yeah.  Is it...  Na, na.  Is it Jimmy something?  No.  Norton.  No, I knew it.  It's Jimmy Norton.  There's a story behind the name of the band.  Because he claims that he named that band. 
[02:07:00]  He named the band.  Yeah.  The name of the band is Steam.  Okay.  And when they were recording, there was a radiator or a radiator.  Oh, God.  And he goes, you know what, guys?  I think you should call yourself Steam.  He tells me an anthony story.  And he's like, and I saw Steam coming out of the radiator.  So I said, guys, a great name would be Steam.  And they said, that's a great name.  No, this is what they said to him.  They fired him.  Now they wrote this about him. 
[02:07:30]  They wrote this about him.  We got an idea for a song, you fucking hump.  Great.  How great is that they didn't have this song.  And he probably said, why don't you name the band Radiator?  And they're like, no, Steam.  No, Steam's stupid.  Yeah.  No, what you said first.  I think a great name would be Thermostat.  When he came back, he at first was Air Conditioning Unit.  What about Duck Twerk?  What an idiot.  You know, someone said, goodbye.  Yeah.  Wait. 
[02:08:00]  Goodbye.  Hold on a minute.  Na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  We like to tell a good story there, Dan Soder.  Spinning a good yarn, as they say.  Wow.  What was this guy's name?  I don't even want to say.  I want like a classic manager name.  It is.  We put out one.  It would be a Jewish name.  I wasn't going to say that.  We put out one comedy CD that did extremely well.  And this guy brutalized us.  Have you made any money from that?  We made a few shekels, a few bucks.  I mean, since like now.  Oh, hell no.  It still sells here and there.  Who owns it?  Terrible. 
[02:08:30]  I don't know.  I've been thinking about just, you know, re-releasing it.  Yeah, you guys.  Because it still holds up.  Maybe add a couple little things to it.  Yeah.  Nice reissue.  A reissue with an exclusive track.  And it tells a story, and he brought it to my attention that we were fucked, because  we would do these CD signings that went on forever, which was cool, man.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We were at malls, and the lines went around the fucking building.  Yeah.  No joke.  One of them was like an eight-hour signing.  And he was selling posters and t-shirts and just counting the fucking money in the corner. 
[02:09:00]  Counting, yeah.  And we didn't see a fucking dollar.  He'd turn in a corner.  He'd literally turn into a corner.  He was like, holy fuck.  He was out of his mind.  If he could, he would have jerked off.  He was so excited and happy.  There was like chess records.  There was like those old record companies where you're just getting nothing.  And he knew he had two suckers, because we didn't know shit yet.  You're like, how cool is this?  You're just excited about the lines.  We were just excited that we were able to sign something.  Oh, happy to be there.  I'm an idiot, though.  I would do the same thing.  We split a quarter per disc sold, I think the deal was.  A quarter?  So we were getting 12 and a half cents per unit. 
[02:09:30]  And we didn't even get the 12 and a half cents each.  Oh, that's fucking...  Because then he would fudge the numbers.  Oh, what a dick.  In the end, we made less than $10,000 off the project.  And you guys probably were like, thank you.  And he's like, no problem.  Yeah, great.  Do you like my new car?  These scumbags, they backload everything.  Like, well, no, you know, there's a distribution fee.  We went after...  Well, we negotiated recently with a distribution fee.  And we're like, what is it?  It's a fucking VIG you're paying a company.  Like, they say, hey, we'll split it 70-30, your favor. 
[02:10:00]  They don't mean 70-30.  They mean 70-30 after they take their distribution fee off the top,  which is sometimes 25%.  So you're splitting 70-30, the remaining 75%.  They're just keeping 25% for no fucking reason.  Right.  It literally is a VIG you're paying.  It really is like, yeah, mafia shit.  And it's fucking...  That's why performers and things like iTunes are great.  You don't have to deal with these scumbag companies anymore.  We never even thought about putting another CD out  because it was such a horrible experience.  You guys got fucked that bad. 
[02:10:30]  And we were making no money.  This was our chance of finally...  We could have fucking made...  I'll never put on a life jacket or make a CD again.  You probably could have made 100 Gs.  They didn't realize...  It would have split.  Expenses had been covered.  No royalty checks had been sent.  10,000 CDs went out.  $200 came in.  Rest went to the manager. 
[02:11:00]  Another quick story about the guy that says a lot.  Before we were on to him and all that,  we felt like, oh, wow, man,  this guy really helped us get a CD out there and all.  And we wanted to celebrate,  so we went to our favorite restaurant at the time.  Some shithole in Massachusetts.  No, the Italian joint there.  Oh, yeah.  Mother Anna's.  Mother Anna's, where the head waiter would try to pick up my chick  right in front of my eyes.  Yes, he would.  And my chick would go for it.  That was wonderful.  But anyway, he's like,  nothing better than a fucking bowl of pasta and a side of cuck. 
[02:11:30]  You know, you say that,  but you'd be surprised how you can go home and fuck her  while saying you really wanted to fuck him, didn't you?  And she's like, yes, I did.  He looked like he had a bigger cock than you.  We both come together and laugh.  Maybe that's just me.  Maybe it's just me.  Maybe it's just me.  In the North End.  And I go in, you know what?  It's such a cool thing that's happened for us and stuff.  And let's treat the guy.  Let's get a limo.  We were limo guys back then.  Like a limo we thought was still a cool thing to do.  Oh, God, like prom night.  And I made the mistake of going to this guy. 
[02:12:00]  I go, hey, man, this is cool, this limo and stuff.  He goes, well, I'll tell you the truth.  I really don't like limos.  Oh, what a dick.  Why would you say that?  Because he wasn't sure if he had to pay for it.  Yeah.  It's absolutely about him not wanting to pay for it.  I'll never forget that because we try to go out of our way  because we were very appreciative.  And meanwhile, he was completely fucking you over.  Yeah.  And he said that too because I'm like, look, isn't it great?  We got a limo going to dinner.  He goes, well, I'll tell you the truth.  I'm just not really, I don't really like limos.  You don't like all of your money.  That's what it was.  He didn't want to pay for it.  He wanted you to know it wasn't his idea. 
[02:12:30]  So he didn't want to pay for it.  If he listens to the show, who knows?  That's when I turned on you.  You just showed your true plans.  Is he still alive?  I don't know.  I don't know anything about him anymore.  And I don't need to.  We don't need to know anything about him.  No, fuck him.  I have no fucking idea.  It's been years.  Fuck him in his ass.  Are you promoting anything?  Or just the podcast?  I think just the podcast.  Bobby's podcast.  It's a good friend.  Bobby.  You know what, dude?  Podcast on Rycast.com.  Dan Soder. 
[02:13:00]  S-O-D-E-R on Twitter.  How did you hook up with Bobby?  Because I mean, I know you're from the cellar, but all of a sudden you were just working with  him.  DeRosa.  Gravity.  All of a sudden I found myself orbiting this gentleman.  No, I get it, dude.  I'm fat.  Dude.  All right.  I get it.  DeRosa actually introduced me to Bobby.  I opened for Bobby a couple of times and then DeRosa didn't show up one day.  And Bobby's like, fucking DeRosa, dude.  Fuck him.  You want to come do the podcast?  Then I showed up and then DeRosa was there like 10 minutes later.  Oh, shit. 
[02:13:30]  I think DeRosa felt threatened.  So he was just like, I'll be here in a nice sweater vest.  He likes the sweater vest.  Joe, the sensation DeRosa.  The sensation.  Jesus Christ, Joe.  DeRosa doesn't do the podcast anymore, though?  He hasn't been on in a while, ever since he moved back to PA and then came back.  Wait, he lives in PA now?  He's back now, but he was in Pennsylvania for a little while.  Yeah, he had to deal with his family.  Oh.  His mom.  Yeah, health issues.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  He did the right thing with his mom.  He was being the good son.  Now he's back, though.  Yeah, I think he's coming back.  We're doing a drunk episode coming up, and I think, of course, he wants to. 
[02:14:00]  Well, then you've got to get him involved.  Yeah.  Sure.  No, has him and Bobby ever rift?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah, no, there's problems there.  Are there?  Am I like the ignorant child that doesn't know that there's a divorce coming?  Oh, boy.  Mommy and Daddy aren't fighting.  You really think Daddy's away from work?  Yeah, like, he just sleeps at work, right?  I never thought my parents were getting divorced.  I was in such denial.  Oh, was I in denial.  I was just, oh, no, that'll never happen.  And then, of course, they did. 
[02:14:30]  My mom was, like, way too upfront about it.  Really?  I was, like, five.  She's like, hey, your dad's gone.  Just me and you.  Gone?  Yeah, and you're like, what?  Just me and you, kid.  All right, this is going to be shitty.  Why did he leave?  Did Mom Alice?  I don't know.  I think he took some money from my mom, I think.  Wow.  Yeah, and then she found out.  She went bankrupt.  So she's like, yeah, you're not allowed here anymore.  Wow, fuck.  Yeah.  Have you never seen him again?  He died when I was a kid, but I saw him a couple times.  He moved back to San Francisco, and I'd go out there, like, once every couple of years  and just be like, hey, guy that I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  Hey, mister man.  Hey, guy that I had to sleep in a bed with.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  It wasn't, like, anything creepy.  He was just a fucking alcoholic bartender that lived with his mom.  So he was like, yeah, me and you on the couch pull-out bed.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it was a-  Some dads are a treat.  It really was.  And he couldn't be more of, like, that dad, like, corduroy shorts and liquor t-shirts.  Yeah.  Just banging chicks named Donna.  Just like, yeah, I don't know.  Go play the video games.  Oh, wow. 
[02:15:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're popping your Atari while your father's fucking-  I'm just fucking here on the back.  I'm just in the same room.  It's like, fuck, dude.  I got some similar stories.  It's great.  Yeah, I'd like the-  I call it cirrhosis dad.  Yeah.  There was-  I remember my dad was with some fucking girl in a bar, and I'm sitting there, you know,  having some soda.  He just kept pumping us full of soda.  Hey, he's taking a soda damp here.  Take us out.  No, no, don't take us out.  Sorry. 
[02:16:00]  And he was shooting pool with some BIM.  That would be funny.  And he's-  I'm not paying attention.  And then he kept, like, looking down her shirt, and he goes to me, he goes, what do  you think?  Like, he's pointing to me, and at the time, I'm really a kid, you know?  It was a good two years before I got laid at 12.  That's always what you want, is your child's opinion on the piece of pussy you're trying  to court.  Yeah, exactly.  What about this one, huh?  These are much better than your mom's tits.  My dad always used to shit on my mom, like, in front of me.  Just make fun of her constantly. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Like, he'd have a beer, and he'd be like, this is colder than the other side of my ex-wife's  bed.  And I'm like, what does that even mean?  I was like eight, and I was like, I don't know.  Was he talking to you, or to his friends about her in front of you?  His friends in front of me.  So he was really kind of doing like a- it was kind of almost like a fuck you to me,  too.  Yeah, kind of.  I'm like, hey, well, guess what?  She feeds and clothes me.  Oh, boy.  She was good to you.  Yeah, she was- she's good.  I got a good mom.  What did he die of?  Cirrhosis.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Oh, he drank.  Yeah, he really went after it.  Actually, what happened was he got hepatitis C, I think, from some chick he was banging. 
[02:17:00]  No, he wasn't a junkie.  You know, he lived in like northern, northern California, where it gets really seedy.  A lot of hep there.  Yeah, the hep area.  The hep area.  Hep country.  Yeah.  And then he just had it, and he was just a drinker, and then it just like-  How old were you?  Damn.  I was 14, I think when he died, but I stopped talking to him when I was 12.  Were you sad?  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm not a fucking sociopath.  No, I mean-  I was like, yeah, the guy deserved it.  Yeah, fuck off.  But I mean, did it mean anything to you? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  It seemed like he wasn't much of a dad.  It was just- it was kind of like a shitty, like, final thing.  Just like, ah, well, there goes ever having that relationship.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the plot thickens, because at the time, my mom was dating- this is fucking so like trash-  Was dating my godfather, who was my dad's ex-best friend.  It's like he's living out the fucking Jim Croce song, Operator.  That's exactly what it was. 
[02:18:00]  It's so sad that that's the- I'm like, it's all locking into place.  I'm like, oh my god.  Yeah, yeah.  I should love that song.  Yeah, that's why.  Holy shit.  Yeah, best old ex-friend, Ray.  So, uh, she was banging his old- his ex-best friend who was on this side of the country.  Yeah, he lived like, uh, he lived with her.  Were they banging while, uh, they were married, you think?  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't know.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's like a lot of shit that's coming to me as an adult where I'm just like, oh,  oh, man.  Oh, gross. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, you just kind of remember it as a kid being like, oh, kid with kid memory.  And it was pre-AIDS, so God only knows-  Well.  Yeah, you know, what was really going down.  Yeah, but back then, there was still plenty of stuff going around.  Plenty of good stuff.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The old favorite, the clap.  There was some chlamydia.  Yeah.  Uh, herpes.  Yeah.  Sure.  Crabs.  I thought you were just listing things I've caught.  I was.  I asked Dan about his My Sister's Dead t-shirt.  What?  Oh, God, yeah.  Bobby wanted to make a t-shirt on the podcast called My- 
[02:19:00]  Just say My Sister.  My sister died when I was 16.  So, I mean, this is-  Jesus.  Oh, fuck, Dan.  I don't know.  I didn't know this was going to be a fucking-  I know, right?  Behind the music-  Yeah, really.  Like, interview.  What the fuck?  First time on the show.  We got to get to know you a little bit.  First time on the show, and-  But you got to ask some of the tougher questions.  Yeah, this really is a 60 Minutes interview.  A car accident when I was 16.  You were the same age?  How old was she?  She was 12 years older.  She was actually my dad.  She was my half-sister.  She was my dad's first kid.  Jeez.  From high school.  What kind of- 
[02:19:30]  Was it her fault, the car accident, or was she-  No, she got rear-ended on a exit ramp on I-10 in Los Angeles.  Oh, wow.  She had, like, a two-seater truck, and her head, the seat buckled, head went into the  back, right near the window.  She alone?  Yeah.  Head trauma.  Ow!  Yeah, we were pretty close.  We got close because of my dad dying.  Like, she-  Yeah.  She was in my life probably from, like, nine years old on.  And then, uh, yeah.  What the fuck is wrong with Bobby?  Well, he didn't know that, and he's like-  He's, like, doing the Bobby reaction.  He's like, 
[02:20:00]  No, no, he thought you said diet, and he just couldn't.  He couldn't believe someone would do that on purpose.  Yeah, so he, uh-  After he looked the word up.  So he was like,  Let's do a My Sister's Dead t-shirt on the podcast.  Shit.  So he might-  Oh, my God.  He loves-  He's a marketing genius, isn't he?  Yeah, he wants to sell it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he calls it, he abbreviates Y-K-W-D. 
[02:20:30]  It's like, do you really think that's catchy?  I know, yeah.  You know what, dude, it's good, but-  And I really am just a waterhead, so I fuck that up all the time.  I'm always like, Y-W-K-D?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, of course.  It's a very confusing, uh-  Yeah, because the name of the podcast is good.  K-2-K-12 to K-2-K-1.  What is it?  Yeah, trucker fucking lingo.  Wow, you've had a hell of a life.  No surprise you're a comedian.  Yeah, it was-  Right?  Yeah, it was, uh-  I don't know, it's weird, though, man, because, like, my mom, you know, always clothed and fed me. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  And so I think that was really only my basic-  That's all you need.  I didn't really bitch a lot.  Yeah.  I just started drinking heavy when I got of age.  There you go.  When did you start stand-up?  I started at 21.  How old are you now?  29.  Oh, okay.  That's about eight years ago.  Wow.  I only know you for, like, a year.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was, you know, doing the alt rooms.  Oh, no.  And the other shows, I mean, I was doing clubs like Stand Up New York and that kind of stuff,  but I've only been at the cellar about a year.  Okay.  The alt rooms are okay.  They're actually supportive crowds.  It's, like, it's easy to shit on them because of the word alt rooms, but a lot of them are 
[02:21:30]  actually really supportive crowds, and they're actually, they're nice.  Yeah.  They're not as fucking jaded and shitty.  They're there to see what you're doing, even if it's not laugh out loud funny.  A lot of times they want to just see where your mind is going.  Right.  There's actually a pretty interesting supportive vibe there.  They listen.  That's, like, you don't have to come out.  You're not going to get a fucking bachelorette party in Bushwick.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And if you did, it would just be awful.  Yeah.  Just a bunch of skinny jeans and just, oh, this is going to be ironic. 
[02:22:00]  This is an ironic bachelorette.  Go fuck yourself.  By the way, you know how much Colin would fucking, I'm just thinking of Colin calling in and  fucking assaulting me for my supportive fucking thing about alt rooms.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Is it really supportive?  Is it really?  Are you playing that much, Jim?  I think I'm going to go see Colin tonight.  He's playing tonight?  Yeah.  He's back in Long Island City.  Yeah.  Creek in the Cave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is a great, that's a really fun place.  Because it's.  Fucking little nothing room. 
[02:22:30]  It really, it's just kind of like a fucking side theater.  Yeah.  And Rebecca who owns it's great.  You feel like people are just going to come in and kick everyone out because, like, it's  not zoned for that or something.  Some old Italian guy.  I've owned this building fucking 15 years.  How long have you kids been doing this shit?  Yeah.  It's funny.  It's just like at the base of the Pulaski Bridge.  Yeah.  How long is, how long, how big is the room?  It sits about, I want to say, like 70 at most.  And it's in what, where?  Long Island City.  It's the first stop off the 7 train. 
[02:23:00]  Vernon Jackson stop.  How far from here?  A few minutes.  From the city.  10 minutes.  It's really easy.  Literally.  You get on the 7, you're there.  First stop in Queens.  Is it full with Colin Collins there?  They don't even know he's there, right?  Yeah.  He gets about 40 people.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  Last time I went, it was pretty good.  I'm sure he's going to do the same kind of stuff he's working out.  It's fucking great.  I love it.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's so funny, man.  I would like to go.  He's fucking, just, he's a smart guy.  He gets characters.  He just is.  He understands characters in New York.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's great.  I want to just go and make big fart noises the whole time.  Bring a slide whistle?  Yeah, no, just like what he's talking about.  Like, get on George Washington.  Great.  Thank you.  Well, we have to break because we did like two straight hours, so.  We certainly did.  I mean, we're going to continue with Dan.  You're not going anywhere.  Dan Soder.  Yes.  Dead family.  Dead family.  Rycast.com does a great job with Bobby on the You Know What Dude podcast.  You know what, Dad?

Yeah, we'll do it after the break a little bit.  All right.  We'll put you on the spot if that's okay.  Yeah, that's fine.  More with Dan.  Stay there.

[02:25:30]  A lot of people are checking that out, though.  You've been on it.  It was fun.  I loved it.  I got to get back and do it again.  It was a fun time.  I've only done it once.  It's done upstairs at Gnome's now place down in the village.  What happened to doing it at his place?  Gnome from the cellar just let Bobby set up an awesome studio.  You should come check it out.  Bobby's got a pretty good setup there.  Good setup going?  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do it.  When?  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Bobby's out of town.  Let's do it tomorrow.  Right now?  Yeah, me and you.  Let's go.  Fuck Bobby.  Bobby's still on his fishing vacation? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  He's fly fishing up in New Hampshire.  He's got his little boat, dude.  I got my boat.  My backpack boat, dude, dude.  Did he bring that fucking stupid fucking boat?  Yes.  I opened for him on Saturday in Boston, and I asked Don, and she's like, yeah, he brought  the boat.  Yeah, he brought the boat.  Wait, at the Wilbur?  Yeah.  How was the show?  It was great.  Bobby murdered.  He lost his voice, and he fucking...  What's with his voice?  It was in and out.  I don't know.  What happened?  Yeah, his voice.  Are we on a porch somewhere?  What happened? 
[02:26:30]  It's getting...  My wind chime ringer.  It's peaceful.  I like that.  How far into it did he lose his voice?  I mean, his voice was shot before the show.  Why?  What's going on with his voice?  I don't know.  It's just been going...  Like, we haven't been able to do a podcast because his voice was shot.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  But it was...  I was like, oh, fuck.  How's he gonna...  Has it been bad for a while?  Like, maybe two weeks?  Three weeks?  That's bad.  Because he had that before his big audition for the show.  Would you do a podcast if he had a voice box? 
[02:27:00]  That'd be creepy as shit.  Did you shit your pants during a You Know What Dude podcast at Bob Kelly's house?  The hell are these questions?  I didn't shit my pants.  People really know Dan Soder.  We should have had him on a long time ago because there's a lot of fans out there.  I like this guy.  I didn't shit my pants doing the podcast.  I was dog-sitting for Bobby, and I shit my pants at his apartment.  At his apartment?  Why?  Why can't you find a toilet?  Here's the thing.  How runny was it?  I mean, it was... 
[02:27:30]  It was awful.  You thought it was a fart?  No.  It hit at the cellar.  I was on antibiotics, and I had a couple beers and some wings, and I felt it drop.  Oh, no.  And I was...  And you don't want to...  You know the bathroom at the cellar.  There's no way I wanted to shit at the bathroom at the cellar.  Never.  Why?  I'll shit anywhere.  I don't know.  No, I don't know.  This one...  I don't want to sit and pee, and I don't like people walking in with my...  I like to enjoy my shit fumes.  Yeah.  I don't like being embarrassed by them and having to flush.  I like to waft them out.  I want to move in them. 
[02:28:00]  You like a nice shit-steam sauna.  I really do.  I fucking...  They're like, why are you putting a towel under the door?  I'm like, that's for me, not you.  That's for you.  Shit fumes.  So it kicked in.  It dropped, and I was like, all right, well, I'm staying at Bobby's in the city.  I can take a cab.  So I jumped in a cab and kind of sat awkwardly.  Wow.  Like, on the hip.  So I got to Bobby's, got in the house, and his bathroom is downstairs.  He's got a two-story apartment with the spiral staircase.  The second I put a foot on that stair going down, it just gave my ass that much light. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, wow.  That was the crack in the door.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  And I just kept saying...  I just kept yelling, it's happening.  I was like, it's happening.  It's happening.  And I ripped the dog gate off and then ran into the bathroom and just sat down on the toilet.  And I've got, he's got two small dogs, and that's the worst feeling, is just two tiny  bits, but...  And you're just like, oh, stop it.  And you've got shit coming out.  I would have shit all over that beautiful shower.  I did.  Leave a little present.  I've, you know, I've never shit myself as an adult. 
[02:29:00]  And what I did learn is that when you shit yourself, you get, like, you get baby butt.  Oh.  Or it's just all over your butt cheeks.  Yeah.  So I had to go wash it off, and Bobby's, just like, just a shame shower, just it washed  it off.  You know what you've got to do sometimes, because your body knows for some reason like  that you're close.  Yes.  And it starts like, just, I'm getting rid of this.  Sometimes you've got to stop.  Literally just stop in your tracks and reset.  All right?  Push it back up.  Push back.  And now continue your march. 
[02:29:30]  Or psych yourself out.  And I'll say, like, I'll be shitting in an hour or a half hour.  Like, I'll almost tell myself a lie.  Like, I get all this stuff to do first.  So my body, like, my body goes, all right, stand down.  Stand down.  Stand down.  Stand down.  We're not ready yet.  I felt the humidity.  Yeah.  You know, like, and I was like, it's, I can feel that it's hot and warm.  Oh, wow.  And then I did, like, the chest up and, like, outside of his apartment, like, ugh.  Yeah, yeah.  I was almost like, I'm a smoker, so I was almost like, should I smoke a cigarette?  Like, that'd be the worst idea.  Yeah, man. 
[02:30:00]  Because that'll just knock everything loose.  Yeah, yeah.  So then I got in the apartment, and I was like, I'm safe.  And then just that one step.  But you said something there that's great.  It's such a good feeling when your shit drops.  Yeah.  And it's just ready now.  Where it's like, boom, bam.  And you're like, okay.  Yeah.  And you can feel it, too.  Yeah, I love that.  I'm going to be lighter soon.  The best description with my friend Jim Weiss is it's a telltale heaviness in your lower  back.  Telltale.  Telltale heaviness.  That's your tail.  You're just like, oh, here, yeah.  All right.  There it is.  And Dan, you can tell by that voice of his, I used to do radio. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I worked in radio for like seven years.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  I worked at K-Rock with you guys.  What'd you do?  Yeah, yeah.  I was on air on weekends.  Oh, wow.  How did I not know that?  Because we didn't know anyone.  Oh, plus it was weekends.  We really didn't.  And I was always doing the shit.  Do you know why we didn't know anyone?  Because we had to do like the XM show still.  Yeah, you guys were doing the walkover.  So it was like, it was just crazy.  We didn't have time to hang out and see anybody.  I got hired when it was free FM.  I was doing weekends.  And then they did like the big announcement.  Were we part of free FM? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Was that the NAW?  Yeah.  No, that wasn't the NAW.  That was K-Rock.  What was it called?  Free FM.  It was FM Talk.  Oh, yeah.  FM Talk.  At 102.  Yeah, it was when they had like DePaulo was at a show.  Nick is a great radio guy.  Yeah.  And they had a, oh, remember that?  JV and Elvis.  JV and Elvis were good.  They had fun.  It was the whole thing like, satellite's going to make you pay, but we're free FM.  You know, the radio chick?  Oh, yeah.  She was there.  I just remember just like always feeling awkward walking into the office because you just hear like, 
[02:31:30]  all right, so our next segment's going to be this.  I don't know anybody.  And then I just did weekends and then they did the flip back to K-Rock.  And I remember that meeting.  They were all like super excited.  Like Chiasano was like, I knew it was coming back.  We had a, you know, we're back for how long?  And we'll blow it again just like we did the first time.  We were there, how long were we there?  Two years maybe?  Oh, yeah.  And we did, we were part of three formats.  Yeah, and then I just remember Tracy Clority. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, we were talking about her just the other day.  You know what's funny?  No bra.  Yeah.  I was attracted to her.  So was I.  You were?  I was weird.  I found her a little ragged.  She was an ugly boy.  She was a little ragged around the edges.  Yeah, but I kind of liked that.  Yeah.  I kind of liked that.  Yeah.  She was sexy.  It's like, you know, when you like, some people buy like sweatshirts that look like  they've been worn for a couple of years.  I'm like, fuck it.  It looks like I've been.  Yeah.  You know she's a good tie.  She's a stonewashed denim.  And then she was just.  Now looking back, I like Tracy.  She was such a bitch. 
[02:32:30]  She was a bitch.  She was a fucking bitch.  To who?  To me.  She was totally a bitch.  To everybody.  She was.  She was just literally everything I said was wrong.  She goes.  The first time she met me, she goes, you have a Colorado accent.  I was like, what the fuck does that?  I don't have an accent.  What does that even mean?  Not much of one.  Maybe she made you sound like a fucking Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold.  See?  It's true.  It's true.  You never want to say see.  See? 
[02:33:00]  Get it?  Yeah.  And she.  Get it?  I ran into her at South by Southwest this year.  How does she look?  What was she doing there?  She works for BET now.  Of course.  BET.  Oh, good for her.  That makes perfect sense.  Well, she ran Hot 97 for like 16 years.  Was she responsible for their success?  Because she told everyone she was.  Yeah.  Well, I remember that meeting.  She was like, this is the only place I would work.  And then you'd walk in.  And I'm like, what are you listening?  You're listening to a three-year-old Incubus album? 
[02:33:30]  Like, we've got to play new stuff.  She's like, I like this song.  She had no idea about the music.  I know.  It was a weird hire.  She was out of her element.  I hated that whole organization.  And fucking from the head on down, all of them stunk.  And I mean from the head of the fucking radio division.  When he came in.  Fucking Dan Mason.  We had a meeting with him.  Dan, Dan.  I had one meeting.  They let me in one meeting with Open Ant and with Chiasano.  All those guys hated me at CBS.  And Tracy and fucking dumb Dan. 
[02:34:00]  And Tracy.  Dumb Tom.  Ugh.  Just explaining why we couldn't say things anymore.  Why we couldn't make fun of blacks.  Why we couldn't do anything.  Do anything.  They were terrible.  Oh, you remember the Words Hurt pamphlet?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Words Hurt.  And they got so mad at us because we thought it was the greatest comedy ever written.  Yeah, they passed that down to all of us.  And we read it word for word and just mocked it.  And they were so pissed.  But we're like, how do you not mock this, these radio guys?  Guys, this is a serious thing.  Right.  Words do hurt. 
[02:34:30]  Do we still have that somewhere?  Iraq, can we find the Words Hurt pamphlet for a future show?  They got so pissed that we read it, though.  Oh, my God.  I think they took all the copies and burned them or something.  I know you guys hated it.  Remember the examples in there and everything?  Stuff we weren't supposed to do?  I briefly remember.  I just remember that it was like a fun job for me, just being in my early 20s.  I'm on radio.  I'm doing shifts on air on K-Rock.  And then when the switch happened, it was just the fucking worst thing ever.  Because they made me stay for like a month to train all of the douchebags. 
[02:35:00]  Train the people that are going to take over your job.  What was that for?  Top 40.  Top 40.  What are they now?  Top 40.  They're still doing the same format.  It's actually working, right?  With an urban slant, Iraq's saying?  So they're finally doing all right?  I mean, they're not doing terribly, but they're not setting the world on fire.  And they lost Nick Cannon.  That was kind of their thing.  Oh, right.  Did they really lose anything?  Exactly.  Why did he leave? 
[02:35:30]  He sucked at radio.  He was awful.  As good as the host of America's Got Talent, but he had no business doing radio.  What's wrong with him?  He's getting some kind of kidney problem or something.  Oh, right.  He realized how horrible radio is and found a way out.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, there's no reason for him to be up at that hour doing stupid radio.  Yeah, it was dumb.  He's got, America's Got Talent.  Right.  And he sucks at radio anyway, so it's not like he was getting any sort of, that's not his calling.  That's true.  And he really sucks at radio.  He's terrible at it.  I want to stress that.  Yeah.  It was horrible. 
[02:36:00]  I never heard one episode.  I never heard one show.  It was uncomfortably bad.  Was it really?  Yeah.  Was it just he kept throwing it to music because he couldn't find anything?  He was doing the hack shit.  Yeah.  He did favorite breakfast cereals.  He did like a half hour on it.  And they didn't even pick my favorite, which I always hate.  Yeah.  I get it.  Yeah, I always like when they pick my favorite, you know.  I'm yelling Fruity Powell.  You know how it goes.  You get it.  Do you do Macho Man?  I can do a Macho Man. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the Macho Man Renly Savage.  Yeah.  Dig it.  That's a really good Macho Man.  That's it.  That's what I was.  I don't know what he sounds like.  That is pretty good.  That's right on.  That's right on.  It's like excellent.  Yeah.  It was a Macho Man.  I'm a big Macho Man fan.  Yeah.  Wow.  I met him and it was really just not what I wanted it to be.  Oh, no.  Does that always suck?  Yeah.  He was doing a rap.  He did a rap album.  I don't know if you guys remember that.  He did like, he actually put out a rap album and he came to the radio station I worked at 
[02:37:00]  in Tucson, KFMA.  And I just went to pick up my check and my program director's like, fucking Macho Man's  in the production studio.  Go to the production.  And I come in there and he's like doing reads.  He's like, yeah, you're listening to KFMA on 92.1.  And then he turns around and he's just, his eyes are all sunken and his skin was all  leathery.  And I was like, hey, I'm a really big fan.  He's like, nice to meet you.  He didn't even like break character.  That's who you are.  And then he just like slumped away.  And I was like, ah, shit.  I wanted him.  That was a few years back already. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  That was like, oh, two, I think.  We lost him about a year ago.  Yeah.  Oh, is he dead?  A couple years ago.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right.  He had a heart attack while he was driving.  What was the name of the record?  Do we have any around?  It's called Be a Man.  That's when he's shouting out Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan.  I don't know if Hulk's here.  Whatever they call you.  Don't have to you, you coward.  I think it is.  Hulk Hogan.  Who said it all?  Said it all.  Who said it all?  Who said it all?  Now you done turns off.  Doing telephone commercials.  I seen ya. 
[02:38:00]  Dancing and tight as a ballerina.  I knew on and all you had those tendencies.  Cause you've been running from macho like I got a disease.  Dude plays your paper.  Me of Emily's a joke.  You're avoiding Randy Savage cause you know you can smoke.  Come on, that pony fight.  The rock's great too fast.  It's not as bad as I expected it to be.  It's bad, Jimmy.  Come on.  I don't like it.  It was a parody event, but the Hulk didn't show up.  He's got that great voice.  I love the thought that there was a producer that's like, yes, keep going.  This is it.  You're rocking it now. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, you got it.  You're in the groove.  He's got a great line where he's like, I was in Spider-Man.  Like, that's like his shit talking.  And he wasn't employed by any wrestling organization when this came out.  So he was actually saying like, no, I really want to wrestle you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like not.  So basically he's begging him.  He's begging him this song.  Yeah.  He wasn't breaking kayfabe.  He was like, please, I need to wrestle you at a carnival or anything.  We'll do it at an opening of a Kia. 
[02:39:00]  We'll do an opening dealership.  Hogan, please.  Florida taxes are not as easy as everyone thinks.  Wow.  I'm closing my eyes.  This is great.  I wish I remembered what Macho Man sounded like.  I was there.  Give us some Macho Man.  We got one.  That's a thing.  He is still the intercontinental champion.  He's from Sarasota.  What's with the broom?  Wait a minute.  What is the professional wrestling completely clean? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Doing the thing.  Yeah.  Like nobody ever does before.  Yeah.  Till Santana.  It's been a while.  Till Santana.  Boston Garden.  And I think that you believe that even though you're head hunting, that you can't beat the Macho Man,  Randy Savage, and you know Hulk Hogan.  He's obsessed with Hulk Hogan.  He's like a girl that fucked him once and can't let it go. 
[02:40:00]  You can call me back, Hogan.  Elizabeth.  My dear, how are you?  Miss Elizabeth Lozada.  You look gorgeous and beautiful.  Thank you.  Yeah.  She died in Lex Luger's apartment.  What happened to her?  Wait.  In Lex Luthor's apartment?  Lex Luthor.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Sorry.  Don't screw up that name.  She died of like pills and booze.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a surprise.  Yeah.  What happened to a wrestler?  Yeah.  She was Randy's chick, right?  Yeah.  They were together for a while.  There's like stories coming out that like Macho Man was like crazy protective of her.  Yeah. 
[02:40:30]  Like he wouldn't let her leave the house.  Oh, man.  That's fucking so funny.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he's a...  I wonder if he caught her fucking around or something.  I don't know.  He's a maniac.  He was an insane person.  He was crazy.  Yeah.  That was like his...  I think that was his real...  Was that his real voice?  He didn't break it.  Yeah.  Like there is no like...  There's no audio of him just like, hi, how you doing?  I'm Macho Man.  I'd like to open an account.  Excuse me.  Oh, that's actually...  Actually, we're on air, man.  Oh, I'm in a...  What I meant to see!  Instead, I go down to a whisper and then I keep talking.  I just like how he whispered really creepy. 
[02:41:00]  But he keeps the deepness when he's whispering.  That's hard to do.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  Macho Man was one of the best.  Yeah, I liked him.  And his frilly shirts.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Bob Backlund would fucking out-wrestle him though, right?  Yeah, well, Bob Backlund...  Wasn't he like an actual wrestler at one point?  Yes.  Yeah, but he wasn't the showman that Macho Man...  Sure he was.  No, he wasn't.  Well, Vince, I want to tell you that I'm just going to go in there and have a good match,  Vince.  He's got the towel around his neck.  Yeah.  When he did that knee walk.  Yeah.  What was the knee walk?  When he would drop to his knees as he was walking.  Oh, yeah.  That's how the man in shape does. 
[02:41:30]  That's a good move.  It's not a good move.  People can get into that move.  Fresh face chicken wing.  By the way, we were talking about radio.  I guess today, it was 10 years ago that we lost our gig.  I want to say August 22nd, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, it was a week after we did it.  Today.  Wow.  Really?  It was the...  Sex for Sam.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  St. Patrick's Cathedral.  10 years ago today.  It's an honor to be in here.  Holy...  Damn.  That's a quick 10 years, huh?  Fuck.  You were 19, huh?  Yeah.  Look at that.  I was smoking a lot of bong loads. 
[02:42:00]  Well, I am a child of the 80s, so...  Of course.  Who isn't?  You guys...  Oh, damn.  Come on now.  We're so children of the 80s.  Oh, my God, man.  19...  You do any other voices?  I do Andre the Giant, which is...  You know, it's been fucked up ever since Dark Knight Rises, because now it just sounds  like I'm just doing a deeper Bane.  Doing Bane.  Yeah, I heard you do Bane.  We both do Bane, but I'm sure he does them better.  Yeah, but your Bane was...  You had me fucking dying when I was at the cellar in the hallway listening to your set.  Your Bane is way funnier than mine is. 
[02:42:30]  Fucking Bane.  Yeah, he says ridiculous shit like Bane.  That's so funny.  The fucking nature thing.  But the Andre the Giant was just basically like,  Hulk Hogan!  I'm coming!  For you!  But then now that's basically just,  The city is yours!  That's just all it is.  It's all...  I'm Gotham's Racketing.  It fucked up my whole Andre the Giant.  I don't even like doing Andre anymore.  His voice came from a deep place.  It was strange.  I got the four horses in case we found the lady. 
[02:43:00]  It just resonated.  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, it resonated in that big head and fucking body.  The big alcoholic body.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at him.  What a monster.  I saw him wrestle once live.  I was in the front row in Rochester for one of the local gigs.  I tell this story a lot, but when he walked in and out of the ring,  I swear to you, flies were following him.  Like, you see flies follow horses?  Look at the elephants.  I swear to you, to this day, to this day, I swear that was true.  I can't get the frogs away from her. 
[02:43:30]  See, that just sounds like Bane after a while.  The more I go, it's just...  It is very Baney.  Let's hear Andre the Giant.  Sam's got a little...  Bob Euchre.  Oh, this is the classic one.  Locate Banna White.  I was supposed to...  Look how big that fucking hand is.  Jesus.  Hi, Andre.  Hey, my good buddy.  Banna, you get me.  You get the Giant.  The only professional wrestler who's still undefeated.  And Hulk Hogan, I'm proud to be it because now Ted DiBiase is on his way up. 
[02:44:00]  That's why you paid me for to keep you out of the tournament.  Scary eyes.  And you are.  And I know one thing, and that's why the people go to know, too, and that's why they  go to remember.  You are the X-Chuck.  You are the X-Chuck.  Everyone hated Hulk.  Hogan really did, yeah.  Pissed a lot of people off.  We were all obsessed with Hulk.  Just Andre and Macho Man really fucking hated him.  Oh, Hogan.  Oh, Hogan.  I don't like you. 
[02:44:30]  For any reason.  You don't.  Call me back.  Hogan.  Well, Hogan and Andre actually came up together in Japan.  He's joking.  Jesus.  They came up in Japan.  Yeah.  Like, they were, like, really big in Japan before the WWF signed them.  No kidding.  Yeah.  And, like, there's a great story.  Sam doesn't tell us this info.  Because when I talk about wrestling, you tell me to shut up.  I just wanted to say that.  I get the courtesy explanation.  I'll take it.  They're like, just let the fucking giant boy talk about wrestling. 
[02:45:00]  I just wanted Sam to say that.  I knew he'd say something like that.  Plus, I'm terrible at voices.  So, it doesn't have to say that.  Especially your own.  Aw.  Poor Sam.  Yeah, it's really funny to think of how many people Hogan pissed off.  Yeah, the Warrior hated Hulk Hogan, too.  Well, the Warrior's just batshit nuts.  Yeah, even after wrestling, again, he's another one that just couldn't shut up about it.  The Ultimate Warrior.  We just wish he would put out more stuff we could listen to.  Oh, all the...  You would think with the election year, he would be...  Excuse me.  What was the one we played? 
[02:45:30]  His reality show pilot.  His Warrior Says thing.  Warrior Says.  Warrior Says.  Oh, this is great.  And his face is just so...  It's so defeated.  He looks like an old bodybuilder's face.  Absolutely.  His makeup always used to come off.  Yeah.  Halfway through the match, he'd be all over the place.  That's Warren Sapp walking right by now.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I swear, man.  Was that Warren Sapp?  I've been obsessing about Warren Sapp.  I think he just went into a shade.  That was his...  Was that Warren Sapp?  Ah. 
[02:46:00]  Did Roland try to get...  It's an inside thing, but fuck.  We're frustrated.  We had a good time with Warren Sapp.  And why did we...  He's doing everyone's radio show except ours.  And then yesterday, we asked for him.  So, wait a minute.  And then everyone's like, well, he came just to do Howard.  You're like, all right, well, now he's here again.  What happened today?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Where's Roland?  Maybe he's a big Hulk Hogan fan.  And he got upset that we were talking about...  There's been a thing going on behind the scenes for the last couple days.  With Warren Sapp.  Nothing bad.  We just want to get him on the show again.  And we've been hearing all sorts of reasons why. 
[02:46:30]  Well, did we ask for it?  We heard he's only doing...  Didn't Talon know he was coming today?  We heard he's only doing TV.  Then we heard he's only doing Howard.  I think you're getting lied to him.  Then we heard he's out of town.  We heard he's only doing phoners.  He just walked...  Maybe he just came...  He might have just come in for Sway.  Maybe he just came in for Howard yesterday or two days ago.  And today, he just came in for Sway.  It'd be nice if he just came in for us.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, we kind of like when that happens.  He's just coming in.  Although we did get one of those recently with Mike Tyson.  That's pretty awesome.  That was because of the Who Kid.  Who Kid hooked it up.  Yeah, Who Kid fucking rolls. 
[02:47:00]  That's pretty awesome.  Mike Tyson just came in.  It's like a Warren Sapp conspiracy.  Yes.  He's fond, dude.  Where's Roland?  I don't know where Roland is.  Travis is walking down the hall, though.  Nice.  Whatever.  Sorry.  That's something behind the scenes that...  You would be talking about...  No, I'm interested in it.  I'm a fan of both things.  So I'd like to know.  Both things.  Both things.  Well, you understand the business.  You know how it is.  It's fucking frustrating.  Travis, is that Warren Sapp?  I have no idea.  Kenny is saying yes.  That's just the most apathetic answer.  I can tell you...  Kenny is saying yes.  I can tell you he's not on the talent list today. 
[02:47:30]  So, you know, he's not, like, doing the rounds around him.  God, that'd be so fucking funny if that wasn't Warren Sapp.  It's just another big black guy.  Well, there's a guy that works at...  Racist thing ever.  There's a guy that works at...  Let's be honest, though.  Come on.  That's really...  Really?  He probably just came in for Sway.  Sam's doing some reconnaissance.  Well, did Roland ask for him, and we were told no?  I really doubt that happened.  I doubt they would just say no.  Okay, it's him.  But did we ask for him and get... 
[02:48:00]  If we didn't ask for him, we have no reason to...  Yeah, I don't...  Look, to be honest with you, I don't think we asked for him.  Well, he was in...  He was in an hour two days ago, so why didn't Roland ask for him now that he was in town?  If I knew he was coming around, I would absolutely ask for him.  Oh, boy.  Maybe we didn't know he was coming around.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  No, Roland's here.  He's definitely really good on the show.  No, Roland's here.  He might be...  Hiding.  He's out of the office.  You just see him pulling an office chair into where he's under a desk.  Yes, he definitely doesn't want to deal with this now.  No, we're quits.  Well, I don't understand everything.  What? 
[02:48:30]  What are you even saying?  They said he was just doing shade because he and his contract...  You think he'll have an excuse?  Man, it's scary.  But there's people...  Don't get the panda mad.  We'll hear his people.  Right, Sal?  Or he'll say you guys didn't ask.  Yeah.  Well, Sam ran down the hall trying to get to the...  He's not in his office.  He's not in his office?  No.  Maybe he's making poo-poo.  Oh, man.  I like the hiding.  Sam's running around the office there.  Look at him. 
[02:49:00]  He's crazy.  Sam doesn't run well.  Sam, no.  He's got those big fucking feet.  Why don't we go out there, then, and just ask his publicist, now that he's here, would  he come in for 10 minutes when he's done doing Sway?  Yeah.  We can do that.  That's not a proper protocol.  You have to go through the channels.  There needs to be a bit of work.  The Marion Barry rule.  The Marion Barry rule.  Yeah, yeah.  We fucking put Marion Barry in here.  It was great.  Was this public?  And he was cool with it?  A lot of people got pissed off.  Yeah, Shade got mad at us.  But if you see Marion Barry walking by, you have to try to get him on. 
[02:49:30]  Rogan was in that day, so we dragged him to the doorway, and we talked to him for a  couple minutes.  Yeah, Rogan was killing it that day.  That's really funny.  He kills it every day.  We haven't had him on in a while, though.  Here comes Roland.  Maybe it's just a big misunderstanding.  I'm telling you, that's what it is.  Roland, what's up with the Warren Sapp?  Now he's here.  Now he's here.  He's right there.  Well, yeah, because he did a show recently, and every time I pitch a guest, within a few  months, he would say, it's too soon.  Well, this one we probably said yes. 
[02:50:00]  No, but the other day we were saying we wanted him, so like...  I didn't hear that.  Yesterday we were saying that.  No one told you?  Didn't we ask you now?  We've been talking about this off and on for two days.  I'll bring him back if you want him, because every time I pitch a guest, you're like,  too soon, too soon, too soon.  Nah, fuck it.  I mean, yeah, I mean...  Well, you gotta ask every time, though, because sometimes it might not be too soon.  Yeah.  All right.  I know that's very confusing, but it's true.  It is confusing, yeah.  Because Warren Sapp is so good, I would get him...  Because football season, right around the corner, all that shit, you know?  You don't like hearing that, though. 
[02:50:30]  Well, I know.  It's great.  Sal.  Roland's right, but...  Sal, where's your production, Sal?  No, I mean, no, if you want him, I'll ask him, he'll come by.  Don't get the panda angry!  Fuck do I hear that?  That's how a panda sounds.  Especially that part.  I like that guttural ending.  It's not a panda, it's a lion.  Yeah.  The production's stuck.  Does anyone know what a panda sounds like?  No.  Not bad. 
[02:51:00]  Not bad.  A bear or he's probably like...  Just my Andre the Giant?  Yeah, some just bear noise.  Can we get a panda sound?  Bear the hounder!  Do you want him for tomorrow?  Oh, no.  We just had him.  No, I was just making sure that we didn't ask for him.  I'm thinking today, because he's right there.  Yeah.  He's right there.  Give it all his ass.  Can we drag him into here for a quick little hi?  I'll ask after he gets done with sway. 
[02:51:30]  Just go into shit.  Yeah, just walk in there.  I'm scared.  Why?  Drop the unbomb.  You're a white man.  Walk in there and fucking take charge.  Things happen.  All right, we'll see.  Oh, it's panda making noise.  That's a guinea pig.  Oh.  Come on, I want to hear...  The guinea pig's name is panda.  Yeah, that was a guy we hired.  That was his idea of a good piece of production for Rollins.  Was a lion noise?  Yeah, for a panda.  But it was his weak voice.  His voice is terrible.  Like, I'm always embarrassed to yell taxi, because I have a weak voice. 
[02:52:00]  So I'm always embarrassed.  Sorry, sorry.  Oh, my God.  It's the cutest thing in the world.  That's crazy.  That's how a panda sounds, by the way.  Change the production now.  Change the production.  It is very cute.  I want one of those in my apartment.  You would take a panda at the compound, wouldn't you?  Of course.  Oh, it's adorable.  How great would that be?  The most pathetic...  That's the name of the... 
[02:52:30]  The video is the most pathetic baby panda ever.  Why is it pathetic?  Why is it pathetic?  It's adorable.  You can't walk upstairs.  That's what YouTube's created.  He's tired.  People are like, look at this fucking stupid baby panda.  You baby panda, you're pathetic.  It's got 20 million views.  Of course.  I want to breed pandas in my apartment.  Oh, they'll love that.  Oh, man, that is an angry cat right there.  It's cute too.  You think that cat's angry?  Let me hear the cat.  It always goes back to cats on YouTube. 
[02:53:00]  I love a pissed off cat.  Go back to this kitty part three.  Oh, fuck that thing.  What a shitty animal.  Yeah.  I love it.  I love a pissed cat.  Pissed off cat's a rule.  Why would you just throw this?  Why would you just throw this away?  Yeah, fuck this thing.  It's a wild animal in your house.  Well, he's torturing it though by kicking at it.  Oh, man. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, no.  No.  Demon fucking face.  Holy shit.  It probably has no claws.  This only has 31 million views.  I dislike it.  I dislike it.  People mad at it.  Don't do this to a kitten.  That poor thing.  Buckets.  Buckets come out from under the table.  Buckets.  Buckets.  How is that mad? 
[02:54:00]  Monsters.  That's a little monster in your house.  That's fucking demonic.  I think they're aliens.  I really don't.  I think they're confident on how the fuck's planet.  I would have said, tell us how you really feel.  Ah, Chip.  Goddamn, Chip.  That's perfect.  Fucking place would have went nuts.  Oh, yeah.  It's a classic.  What place?  You ever see the video of the guy yelling at his cat?  No.  Oh, it's a classic.  I fucking hate cats.  Yeah, you're not a cat guy?  Even the cute kittens they have on YouTube?  Nope.  I don't like them.  Are you one of those guys that puts them in the burlap sack? 
[02:54:30]  I'm not a fucking serial killer.  I'm not putting them in an oil barrel and lighting them on fire.  I like the noise they make when they're burning.  But every town has that guy.  Yeah.  And they always end up killing someone and going to prison.  They have to get rid of kittens in the most horrific way.  Burlap sack.  Oh, that was my town.  Centiport.  They really did.  They just threw a bunch of kittens in a burlap sack.  That's terrible.  And the bridge over there, Mill Dam.  Mill Dam Bridge.  They threw them off the bridge.  When I was growing up.  Yep.  They threw them off the bridge. 
[02:55:00]  What the fuck?  In a burlap sack and they were found dead in the...  Yeah, it's horrible.  Poor thing.  Absolutely horrible.  One of the worst things I've ever seen on video was a fucking cat in a cage.  And some fucking kids, they threw poor lighter fluid on it and they just burned it.  It was fucking...  It was like one of those horrible sites I go to.  Why would you look at that?  I couldn't get through it.  Oh my God.  It was very sad.  You saw the dog video from the Middle East, right?  The cutest dog ever that they lit on fire and let run around.  No.  Just talking about it, I almost have a tear in my eye.  No. 
[02:55:30]  It's the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  I don't go for horrific shit.  I really don't.  But I somehow got tricked into it.  I don't know.  I forgot what the title was or something.  You went down like one of those video worms.  Something.  Yeah.  Oh, happy puppy.  It brought me to tears.  It was so disgusting.  It was the behavior of the kids that really totally got to me.  Besides the dog, obviously, burning alive.  I mean, that's adorable.  They were laughing.  I think it was the funniest fucking thing out.  I like that cat.  Just because that's adorable.  But then what?  We learned they don't like dogs in the Middle East or something.  Yeah.  They're like rats over there or something. 
[02:56:00]  Plus, they'll run onto a bus with a bomb strapped to them.  It's kind of hard to imagine that they value dog life.  Yeah.  That's the other truth.  When they send their children out there like, you know, good boy.  Good boy.  You know, like when they fucking cut a hand off for stealing.  Yeah.  They're probably, I mean, that is a great video.  It's great.  It's probably at Rogan's house to fucking, it's a pot lollipop.  Pot lollipop.  It's just eating a sour apple lollipop.  And it gets four million views.  Oh, great.  Four million views.  It's adorable.  What's the one lower left?  Do you know my cat?  Oh, no.  My cat used to love eating fucking olives. 
[02:56:30]  Really?  My cat's name was John.  Olives.  And he loved olives.  Sounds like a guy my mom used to date.  Hey, Trish, you got the extra?  Olives.  Sorry, John.  We're all out.  Non-pitted.  Aw.  Sneezed.  Oh, the poor little kitty.  You really can't just find the most adorable and horrific shit all within a five minutes.  All right there.  Click away.  Click away from either end of the spectrum.  It's amazing. 
[02:57:00]  Are you a dog guy then?  Yeah, I love dogs.  Yeah?  Big dog.  I like animals.  I don't.  Do you like Bobby's dogs?  Because he gets mad at me.  Because I don't like those yip-yap dogs.  I like Diva.  The other one, Kelby, just when I dog sat it, he fucking snores like a coal miner.  Really?  It's like this small dog.  You need a dog that's going to bother you.  I don't like that.  Dogs that fucking snore and fart and shit.  It's like, what do I have?  I have a fucking trucker over my house?  Exactly.  Hey, what's up?  I'm Lloyd.  I'm going to be sleeping on the foot of your bed.  You've got to take care of me. 
[02:57:30]  I'm going to snore and fart and you fucking stink your room up.  I want that.  Kelby loves me.  What's that?  Kelby loves me.  Kelby hates me.  You feed him boogers.  He loves me.  No.  Bob said it made him hate his dog.  How much his dog...  His dog makes a seal noise.  Like...  The love is so bursting out of it.  Bursting?  And Bob's like, dude, it makes me hate my fucking dog.  Oh, really?  See, I mean, I love Diva because she's, I mean, like, just lays around lazy.  When I was like dog sitting, I was just like, okay, this dog's the best. 
[02:58:00]  Oh.  That's crazy.  I just read Jim Norton's tweet.  Oh, yeah.  Ten years ago today, the Opie and Anthony show was fired from WNEW.  The three of us were standing in front of a Starbucks when the call came from Bob.  That's exactly right.  We were standing.  I want to say it was 67th and Amsterdam.  66th and Columbus.  Oh, it's Columbus.  You're right.  Oh, and I had a fucking call.  66th.  I had to call my parents.  67th and Columbus.  And I'm like, oh, no, everything's going to be cool.  Don't worry.  No, this is nothing. 
[02:58:30]  Don't worry.  It's cool.  And meanwhile, I'm just like, oh, my God.  I just, I'm doomed.  You were on the phone.  Oh, picked up the phone.  It's over.  We're standing in front of a Starbucks.  We were talking.  We had just walked from the office.  Yeah, that's Bob.  Okay.  All right.  They're canceling the show.  You were kind of repeating.  You were reporting what Bob was saying.  Because I didn't want to, like, just save it for my.  I was just depressed.  No, no.  But I mean, that's how I remember it.  Internalize it.  And then just be like, oh, by the way.  I was like, I was just fucking repeating as quick as I could.  So everyone got the info at the exact same time.  We all went and sat at your picnic table in your backyard. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, man.  Fucking chatted.  God, you remember more than I do.  But now that you said that, I do remember this.  Oh, and all the coverage was on TV.  Yeah.  Just looking at the news, and it's like, whoa, full, full, full, full, full, full work again.  Do they do that shitty cable news thing where they're like, shock jocks, I'll be in a hand of the air out.  It wouldn't stop.  We fucked up when it was an extremely slow news cycle.  Not even a day.  Yeah.  So they went with this for close to a week straight. 
[02:59:30]  No joke.  Panels and everything.  Oh, bringing in anyone to talk about the First Amendment.  Oh, that, bringing in shock jocks.  We must have some production from today, because it is a 10-year anniversary of the firing,  so we must have some stuff to play production-wise from the old days, right?  Anyone comment?  Who would be responsible for that?  Oh, my dad's dead.  Should we talk about that?  There you go.  Did you guys hear that Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant wrestled in Japan together? 
[03:00:00]  You're deflected.  Who's responsible for this?  I don't know.  Do you have the news montage, at least, or something?  I think we have a news montage.  Holy fuck, we're not...  Is everybody asleep at the wheel?  Everybody's asleep at the fucking wheel.  Hang on.  Everybody.  Oh, hang on.  Oh, E-Rock says E-Rock.  I mean, that wasn't...  I mean, you might be able to pull something up, but I mean, we don't have anything ready  like today's the 10-year anniversary.  We probably should have had a discussion, like, how do we, you know, what do you want 
[03:00:30]  to do for the 10-year anniversary?  Anything?  Maybe we would have said no, nothing.  E-Rock, you don't know.  All right, a couple things on that.  Not too long ago, I did make a mention, and we were...  It was just kind of like...  Did not.  Did not.  You did not.  Bullshit.  Did not.  I did.  And I also have...  Did not.  Did not.  I also have cuts of these...  Did not.  Do not.  Do not.  Do not.  Do not.  Do not.  Do not.  Didn't hear you.  It's not even on the...  Is it on the thing here today?  Am I seeing this?  Oh, boy. 
[03:01:00]  It's not even on the fucking show prep thing.  We do have that the transportation board approved the Tappan Zee Bridge, and that the high school  valedictorian denied diploma after saying hell in the graduation speech.  Oh, she was hot.  Oh, that was a story from yesterday.  Fair enough.  That was very hot.  Stories for today.  The illegal immigrants don't want to be called illegal.  Daycare workers arrested for setting up and filming Toddler Fight Club.  Okay.  Great.  The AC.  Wait, that's a real thing?  Yeah.  Toddler Fight Club.  Well, you know, it was one of those things that sounded like a good idea.  Michael Paul.  Go on. 
[03:01:30]  Go for the diapers.  They can't charge you if they just fall off in combat.  In combat, huh?  In combat.  Yeah, my friend got off on that in Thailand.  They said the diapers fall off.  Diaper fall off.  Not charge a diaper fall off.  Wow, we were young.  It's been a rough 10 years, huh?  Please.  Can we hear a little bit?  All right, Sam.  What is that?  Nods.  Opie.  The O'Reilly Factor is on. 
[03:02:00]  Tonight, two shock jocks ripped from the airways because of a controversial sex stunt.  They'll tell you about it.  But first, our top story tonight.  Syndicated radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony have been kicked off the air.  Fired over this sex stunt they pulled inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Last week, the duo broadcast an eyewitness account of a couple having sex inside the church.  And yesterday, they were officially canned.  So there you go.  It was.  O'Reilly interviewed the pair recently, and they insisted they're careful to never cross 
[03:02:30]  the line.  Oh, boy.  Right.  Here is that.  Oh, you had it, right?  A little editorializer.  Where's this fucking guy?  Oh, my God.  Look at Opie's head here.  Who's that kid?  I like that hair.  Holy shit.  That's dream butt.  Yeah.  That's Tiger Beat shit.  Wow.  You really are.  Hey, it's fucking Lance Kerwin.  Oh, man.  That was a year or two prior to we were fired.  Yes, that was.  They're making believe that O'Reilly, you know, just talked to us recently. 
[03:03:00]  They went to the archives.  This was an interview we did.  The one time we ever talked to O'Reilly.  Yeah, this is an interview we did with O'Reilly, like, before that.  When we were on the top of our game.  Oh, no, no, no.  Do we have to do that?  No, play a little bit.  Just for a second.  I'm just.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The big operation, the big radio operation.  Do they care what you say on the air?  Oh, without a doubt.  We have to do every day.  We have guidelines.  We have FCC, you know, rules we got to adhere to, and we do a very good job at that. 
[03:03:30]  Well, you skirt it.  Our show is.  You skirt it.  You're smart.  Yes, you skirt it.  We're very smart.  We know where the line is, and we tiptoe on the line, of course.  We know at this point what our audience likes.  We know how to do it, and that's what we give them.  Well, what do they like?  What do they want?  They like to be entertained.  Yeah.  Be specific.  Be specific, though.  You just said.  Wait, wait, wait.  You just said.  Mm-hmm.  We know what our audience likes, and we give it to them.  I want specifically what they like.  Okay.  You know what men like, Bill?  No.  Talk about sex. 
[03:04:00]  Talk about sports.  Talk about.  Entertainment.  Hanging with their friends.  Talk about sex.  TV shows.  Talk about sex.  Sex is number one.  There's sex in there, sure.  We wouldn't consider sex number one on our show.  No way.  No way.  Every time I turn in.  The media likes to pigeonhole it that way.  Well, wait a minute.  Every time I turn into your program, there's a babe taking off her top.  There's an asshole.  There's a babe?  Babe.  He calls her a babe?  There's a babe.  There's a guy in the shower talking about his loofah sponge in his big car.  Oh, wait.  That's me, allegedly. 
[03:04:30]  Fucking asshole.  Shut up, Bill.  Whenever I go meet a nice babe.  A babe.  O'Reilly hated us, and he was trying to pigeonhole us into a sex show.  It was way more than a sex show.  We did a lot of sex stuff.  Yes.  I love he just kept saying sex over and over.  He's like, sex.  Sex.  Sex.  Well, what do you want to talk about, Bill?  Right.  What are you doing?  Sex.  And every time he tuned in, there was a girl, really?  Every time, Bill?  Every time.  That means you were listening a lot.  When I'm making my English muffin in the morning, I just turn on O&M. 
[03:05:00]  And listen to sex.  He's either lying, or he was very obsessed with our show.  Which one is it?  Someone grab Roland, because Warren Sapp has left him.  Roland's going the other way.  I saw Warren Sapp.  What happened?  What happened?  He had to go do the Evan and Phillip sports show.  What is that?  It sounds made up.  It sounds made up.  I got to go to Evan and Phillip?  Evan and Phillip.  It's a sports show.  They talk the sports.  Yeah, yeah.  He would rather plug on that fucking shitty show than on this one. 
[03:05:30]  We don't even know if it's shitty.  My Evan has a great show.  Evan saved his life in the NOM.  Have you heard of that show?  Have you heard of that show?  I think it's Steve.  Never even heard.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  We like Steve.  No, but that's actually legit.  We like how he fucks up things.  All right.  Fair enough.  I like Steve.  Sex, though.  You were talking about sex.  Sex.  You got a babe.  Taking a tap off, babe.  He talks like those douchey frat boys at bars when they're trying to get their girlfriend's 
[03:06:00]  attention.  Babe.  Babe.  Babe.  Babe.  And the editing he did to this interview.  We were stupid.  We sat for, I don't know, almost an hour, but probably 40 to 45 minutes.  You thought you were going to get the whole episode?  Yeah, the whole story.  And I got into some deep shit with him.  And then, man, when we saw this piece, we were amazed.  He chopped out everything and just focused on sex, assholes, dicks.  Live and learn.  Cunts.  Yeah, he made you guys sound like a bunch of whatever.  He's not going to put the good parts in.  I know, we learned.  We didn't know.  We were really, we were brand new to the whole media crap back then. 
[03:06:30]  Roland.  Anthony's giving the, sorry, Anthony's giving the creepy fucking chin down, eyes raised look.  What a psycho you look like.  I really, I really am.  What a man like, Bill.  Bill.  Tell me, Bill.  You're pulling a photo of a child.  What a man like, Bill.  Say it.  It was on to him.  It's slower.  You were so on to him.  Like, you ain't going to fucking do this shit, does it?  Yeah, but I was powerless.  He had some Jedi mind shit working.  Yeah.  He's got principle, like a principle.  Of a high school fucking aura.  That's how I felt. 
[03:07:00]  His chair was taller.  He was, like, taller.  He came walking in.  We were wired for sound.  We were sitting down.  He's a giant.  And he came walking.  He's a tall guy.  So it was just like, uh-oh, we're in trouble.  Gentlemen, how are you?  Yeah.  Good.  You know why I called you into my office?  What happened?  I didn't do anything.  You were messing around with some babes.  With some babes with their tops off.  Yeah.  Babes.  Bab.  Roland.  Oh, what's that?  I like Girls Daily.  Oh.  On Twitter.  Jesus.  What's fat, heavy tits?  A big fat tits.  I would just pull it out and just say fat and heavy. 
[03:07:30]  Well, like a jungle left, right.  Fat and heavy, heavy and fat, fat and heavy.  Heavy and fat, heavy, fat, fat, heavy.  It just says, want to pillow fight her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Better than clean tag, you know?  I guess the answer's yeah.  He played Tag in the Dark recently.  Look.  I didn't think up the name.  You're making fun of it?  It was in my theater at home.  It's very dark in there.  So we decided we were going to turn the lights out, shut the door, and then play a Tag in there.  It's very hard to, because you can't see.  You can't run. 
[03:08:00]  It's not a running game of Tag.  It's a slow, more of a groping game of Tag.  That sounds fantastic.  Right?  It sounds like you're taking child wonderment to an adult level.  It sounds like the type of thing an adult does with a four-year-old under a blanket.  Do you want to play Fort?  You want to play Fort Tag?  Hey, you want to play shirtless hug Fort Tag?  Let me tell you something.  Let me inspire you when you have your 30-year-old birthday crisis.  All right.  I'll call you up immediately.  I will inspire you and say, don't worry, it doesn't have to end. 
[03:08:30]  It doesn't.  You can be Peter Pan.  Live forever.  Yes.  Rowan, what do you got?  I didn't invite you in, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Bye.  Not in a bad way.  He's available at 1020.  What's he got before that?  Listen, that's going to be great.  He's doing sports shows live right now.  I'll listen on my way home.  Okay.  He's doing NFL Live.  I'll have fun with Warren Sapp, Sam.  I don't want it.  No, that's fair enough.  He'll be here tomorrow morning at 8.  For us?  Yeah.  What?  Wow.  I'm kidding. 
[03:09:00]  That's such a diabolical app.  I personally don't give a shit about Warren Sapp.  I know.  I don't even care.  I liked him.  I thought he was great.  But I mean, yeah, yeah.  I thought he was good and everything.  Now it's too much work.  But personally, I don't care.  Now it's too much work.  I think it'd be good for the show.  I think he was a fun guy or anything.  Yeah.  But personally, it's not like having somebody from Breaking Bad in or something like that.  All right.  Jimmy's out tomorrow.  So me and you and what is it?  And it's Friday.  Go like this.  Oh, fuck him in his ass.  All right.  We're done with Warren Sapp.  I can't care.  It's too much work now.  Are you sure you're not just doing the thing where the guy, you want to hit on the girl 
[03:09:30]  at the bar and then she walks away and you're like, fuck that chick anyways.  I didn't want that.  Never wanted her.  Never wanted her.  You look at her ass.  She's fat.  I saw her.  Fat ass.  I wouldn't pay naked tag with her in a million years.  Fuck no.  I wanted, just didn't want to put too much work into her.  All right.  See?  Now it's a thing.  Now it's when you call a thing.  I don't want a thing.  Well, as Morgan Freeman said, and I retweeted, don't complain about results you didn't get  from work you didn't do.  I retweeted Jamie Hector when he wrote that. 
[03:10:00]  I'm going to retweet Jim Norton.  I normally don't retweet like black radio station type things.  That sounds like a black radio station slogan.  Keep your mind on your money and your money.  All right.  Got it.  Got it.  You reverse it.  Got it.  Wonderful.  Do we really have to do this Bill O'Reilly thing?  No, I don't know.  Are we done with it?  I just wanted to know about the thing about being fired.  Whatever.  Yeah, we don't have to go through the whole fucking thing.  I just like the dopey local area.  Just thought it would be on the prep sheet.  Yeah, I wanted to see the shitty shock jocks they brought in to talk about it as their 
[03:10:30]  experts.  Oh, you realize who really hated us because they couldn't wait.  Greaseman.  Greaseman couldn't wait.  It's obviously done.  Yeah, what a doodle.  Yeah, it's obviously they are done.  Never to be on the airwaves again.  A lot of people were very happy that day.  From the unemployment office.  Thank you.  Thanks, Grace.  Man, a cow took his shots.  Yeah.  There were a bunch.  Yeah.  I got him back, though, on the phone that day. 
[03:11:00]  Sure did.  Fucking best call him.  I got straightened him right out with a fact.  I was trying to prank a man cow, and I called him up and waited on hold, and I was going  to preface it with a legitimate part of the call, and I never got to the prank part,  so all it ended up was me calling and doing a great call.  Just softballing him?  Yes.  Well, yeah, because that's a great question.  I'm ready to get in there, but I'm listening to answer the question, and then he hung up  and continued answering the question.  I'm like, motherfucker. 
[03:11:30]  I just gave him a great call.  I wanted to prank him and fucking make him look like an idiot.  Take down that guy's number.  That was a good call.  That was very good.  Maybe I haven't called that.  Hire him.  I got to say it.  That broad doesn't know how to walk in high heels, man.  All right.  She's fat.  She's probably not.  She can't believe they're not breaking.  She's probably used to putting the fucking pressure on the front part of her feet.  Do you have any high heel snaps she's heard?  She's amazed they're not turning into flats.  Exactly.  By the time she's at the other end of the hall.  She can aerate concrete.  She makes everyone uncomfortable.  She's got these four or five inch heels. 
[03:12:00]  And she can't walk in.  Is this wobbly?  I didn't even see it.  Horribly.  Looks like she's going to break her ankle.  Oh, God.  So 10 years ago today, huh?  Yeah.  Let me hear just another little bit of this.  That's just a little.  It's kind of depressing.  Yeah.  But it's also.  It brings all that back.  Yeah.  That negative feeling.  Oh, that feel like shit.  It's like, oh, God.  Blew it again.  Yeah.  It was a long two.  26 months.  26 months officially.  Yeah.  And I literally, I was paying $340 a month with Jim Florentine and his girlfriend at the 
[03:12:30]  time in New Jersey.  There was three of us splitting like a $900 and something.  And I moved into New York in April of 2002 and paid a $2,200 a month two-year lease.  Five months later, we were fired.  Oh, my God.  I was fucking.  My money had just doubled.  I was making.  And the new contract hadn't been signed yet.  But I figured my money doubled. 
[03:13:00]  I'll be able to afford it.  Wow.  I remember standing with Bob Kelly outside of our apartment on 43rd Street in the back.  He's like, dude, you're going to be fine.  Oh, I hate that.  He actually made sense.  But I remember looking up.  What?  I live on the 22nd floor.  I'm like, I should just go up there and jump.  Oh, wow.  That was bad.  It was one of the most depressing times of my life.  It was terrible.  It was terrible.  I hated that.  Stopped all momentum immediately.  In hindsight, I'm glad it happened.  It made me a better stand-up.  And it fucking did two years of Tough Crowd, which I never would have been able to do. 
[03:13:30]  That's true.  That was fucking good.  Tough Crowd was great.  In hindsight, I so wish we didn't do that.  In hindsight.  Yeah.  In my hindsight.  Guess what, Dan?  Wow.  We've been trying to get the momentum back ever since.  Jim was like, yeah, no, it was actually great.  No, but just fuck this shit.  Way to make lemonade.  Guess what?  There's still stupid lemons.  Yeah.  No, for my stand-up, I'm saying maybe because I was doing theaters at the time.  But it actually just forced me to fucking do more material.  I became a better comedian than I would have if I had just started doing whatever. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, you had to.  You had to work at it more.  And Tough Crowd made me write.  You had to write something.  Yeah.  I got something out of it, but.  All right.  Let's hear Bill Rapp.  Nah, we don't need money here.  That's a guess after all.  I don't care.  I just figured it would be on the.  Yeah, I would have liked more of the montage of all the asshole news people.  Yeah, this isn't even a news thing.  It's just.  You got the montage of all the asshole news people?  Why did nobody do any mention of this?  Are you asking me?  I'm asking everybody in general on the staff.  It's okay.  It's cap on it.  I didn't even.  I didn't know today was the day. 
[03:14:30]  E-Rock?  Hmm.  I have clips from Sex for Sam and the last show.  Yeah, I didn't know it was today.  One guy said I didn't know.  What does E-Rock say?  I have stuff from the last two shows.  Clips and highlights and what have you in your last segment.  Lacey's ass is in the camera.  That you found?  No, I have it right here.  How come they're not in here?  There's no way you had that the whole time.  Come on, E-Rock.  I had it the whole time.  Why wouldn't you put it in front of me?  Why wouldn't you put that in front of me?  Ah, E-Rock, stop, stop.  Why are you keeping it?  You don't know because anytime I brought some shit like this, I don't know if we really want 
[03:15:00]  to go down that road.  Oh, yeah, because the 10-year anniversary is not really a big one.  Maybe the third anniversary or the three and a half.  Yeah, this is not the sixth anniversary.  Right.  E-Rock, come on.  Come on.  I had it in here the entire show.  I got stuff from two months ago that is still in front of me.  Who cares?  What do you got in front of you that's more important according to Eric than?  Bristol Palin's son Craig calls Suzanne a faggot on their reality show.  Right.  That's old.  From 1966, Gore Vital gets into an argument with William F. Buckley while talking Vietnam.  No, I'm on TV. 
[03:15:30]  Gore Vidal.  Yeah, yeah.  Gore Vidal, sorry.  We had mentioned that, I think.  That just didn't make any sense, except there was Gore Vidal.  He just died.  Oh, right, right, right.  Bob Beckel, who said fuck on Hannity and insisted they were not on the air, says fuck on Fox News again.  And St. Clown Posse announces they are suing the FBI.  Stuff like that.  Well, that's better than the 10-year anniversary of the firing.  Yeah.  But I'm legitimately mad at E-Rock, because I know he just found that to try to cover his ass a little bit, and I'm calling him out on it, and he won't admit it. 
[03:16:00]  Because you're wrong.  How come you didn't bring it in, though?  Why do you have it in there?  I have everything in here.  Because you went and found it quickly.  You know he's not pointing at his head.  No, I didn't.  Pointing at his stomach.  If you pulled something like that, you would either bring it to my attention or leave it in front of us.  You know that.  Sam?  Never gets awkward. 
[03:16:30]  Who's the problem with E-Rock?  Sam.  If he had just said, I didn't know, it's not necessarily his responsibility.  He could have just gotten off by saying, yeah, I didn't know.  It wasn't right.  But then he goes, I have it right here.  I have it right here.  If you wanted it, I would have given it to you.  Hoagie boy.  But what about, it's not even on the prep sheet.  Sam, who does the prep sheet?  Do you believe this?  I need someone.  He would have said.  Let's ask Travis.  He's the producer.  Where is he?  He would have simply said, I have the clips.  But I think E-Rock had them pulled from a while ago and assumed you didn't want them, but just left them pulled. 
[03:17:00]  Like, he didn't pull them for two days specifically.  E-Rock, comment.  We pulled these for the fifth year anniversary that never got played.  Okay, so you've had it in there for five years.  Five years.  I've been sitting on this for five years.  It's different.  I've had it for years.  Yeah.  Oh.  Travis, explanation, please.  Travis, comment.  I didn't put it on the prep sheet because I didn't realize today was the day. 
[03:17:30]  If I knew that, I would have put it on the prep sheet.  I've put other anniversaries on the prep sheet that have gone unmentioned.  I would have put it on the prep sheet.  The information that never been sent.  I can also stick up for Eric.  Eric did have those clips pulled.  He had them ready.  He told me that he would have them ready.  Then how did, if he told you you'd have them ready and you didn't know it was going to be the anniversary, how did that happen?  Oh.  No, he told me that he would have them ready.  I didn't, he didn't tell me that tomorrow was the anniversary.  Today.  No, no, no.  He told me it was yesterday.  Well, if he said, now if he said, look, the 10 year, I'm going to have the 10 year anniversary stuff ready. 
[03:18:00]  Wouldn't you think you'd go, okay, when is it?  Or did you just go, all right, whatever.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  I didn't know that it was today.  I think Rock should have gave it, put it in front of us.  But he did ask you guys a while ago if you guys wanted to do anything.  And like he said, you guys were very, you know, not enthusiastic about it.  But it still should be on the list for today.  Yes, it should.  And I'm sorry that it's not.  I mean, he should have still provided the.  And I'm sorry, I had him in here.  If he said, do we have those clips?  I would have given those to him right away.  But I had him here the whole show.  Right. 
[03:18:30]  I was trying to do like the empathetic, coming down, authoritative figure.  Okay.  Oh, they're calling you Dr. Fail.  That's fine.  I really don't give a fuck what they call me.  I really don't.  I really don't.  I could care less what the listeners think.  Oh, we should queue up.  We're not going to take it. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, man.  It's uncomfortable in here.  B-Rock, comment.  B-Rock, how do we blame you in the end?  Yes.  How do we make it about you again?  I don't know.  You did four hours already.  Whoa.  Come on now.  Come on now.  We moved on from you.  Really?  That Dan Soder, is that all about you?  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  Remember when I did Macho Man in happier times?  Yeah, you're right.  I brought it to Travis, but he gave it right back to you, and you didn't pass it back. 
[03:19:30]  Sam, don't you believe E-Rock would have put it in front of me?  I believe E-Rock may be the worst person at avoiding blame.  Oh, I thought you were going to say the worst person on staff.  I don't necessarily.  He's really bummed that he forgot.  Yeah.  Because he's usually good at this stuff.  For real.  I don't think that E-Rock is at fault for this, but he cannot.  He just can't get himself off the hook.  There is a way to convince E-Rock that if he had just made the right call, 9-11 wouldn't have happened. 
[03:20:00]  You think he takes a lot of blame for that?  Yes, as he should.  Just goes home and drinks alone in the dark?  I could have changed everything.  Do you blame yourself for 9-11?  Pounds, E-Rock?  What could you have done differently that day?  Seriously, though.  What could you have done differently?  He's making believe he has something else to do.  No, I don't have nothing to do, because your question was fucking retarded.  I'm not going to answer it.  It's supposed to be. 
[03:20:30]  Obviously, that's the point of it, silly.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Why would you actually not answer it?  Because it's a dumb question.  Yeah, I didn't.  Remember, I did this for you.  Where are you going?  We know that.  He said he did.  Like, you should have just answered it.  Sam, remember?  Remember?  It was such a ridiculous...  Equally ridiculously, you should have answered it.  Yeah, because it's not a real implication that you didn't...  No shit.  I know that.  So you should have answered it.  I'm going to keep going with this.  Why wouldn't I?  Until I feel you understand. 
[03:21:00]  You haven't convinced me that you get this.  I get it.  You don't?  I don't think you do.  So what could you have done differently in Dallas in 1962?  You're right, Common.  Obviously, get his big body in front of the car.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Sorry.  He's the food depository. 
[03:21:30]  Travis, you don't look happy.  I'm fine.  Okay.  I'm completely fine.  Did they offend you what they said?  No.  Are you mad at me for bringing it up?  I'm not mad at you at all.  No.  You should have been on the sheet.  It wasn't.  Dr. Fowl's a little harsh.  It's a little harsh.  Yeah.  I just see these things and think they're funny anyway.  I'm not going to get everything right, you know, all the time.  Something would be nice.  We had things.  I know.  We have things.  Oh, no.  You're feeling me rocking out.  We have things every year.  You're being very literal.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, literal Dr. Fowl. 
[03:22:00]  Exactly.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  All right.  Do we have winners here today?  No.  No winners?  No.  That's too bad.  Not at all.  I feel like I was.  Yeah.  I agree.  I think Dan won.  Jimmy's a winner.  Dan's a winner.  Dan's a winner.  Dan's definitely a winner.  Yeah.  I think Open Ant won.  Oh, yeah.  Hulk Hogan is not a winner.  No.  No.  Not a winner.  Macho Man hates him.  Don't forget Hulk Hogan.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  That's true. 
[03:22:30]  Intern Rob.  Winner.  Winner.  Winner.  Biggest winner.  Yeah.  And soon to be playing golf.  Golf without being much to Iraq's chagrin, I would say.  Me and two others.  So what do you think for Intern Rob's future?  Do you think tomorrow he tries to come in gangbusters again or does he let this ride out?  I would.  You know what?  He has to.  I don't know what to expect from him, but I would play it safe.  If he's smart, he won't show his face until the end of the day Friday.  But I think he's thinking I could hit him with a double shot.  Yeah.  I got their attention now. 
[03:23:00]  Let me hit him again with something huge and big and amazing.  He probably won't be as good as today, though.  No.  That's the gamble.  Yeah.  Is it going to be good?  Probably not.  It might be good.  Well, now the expectations are higher.  Very.  Very.  And let's be honest.  If Iraq had shut him down quick, shut the fuck up and just shut him down, it would have been distinct.  Iraq, would you have done anything differently?  Iraq, comment.  With the Apollo 13 mission, what would you have done differently? 
[03:23:30]  I'm not going to answer that.  I don't work for NASA.  The simple question is Pearl Harbor.  Could it have been avoided?  What do you think?  Iraq, comment?  Matt?  Iraq, you can't not talk.  Why is he not talking?  Because I think he's at the point.  He's freezing you out.  He's at that point, yeah.  He's had it.  It's not going to work.  He's so had it today.  He's had it for shit.  We're not going to give up on our questions.  He's going to only poke him so much.  But I'm not poking him.  It's a legit question.  Oh, it is.  Shitheads.  Yes. 
[03:24:00]  Do you think we're shitheads?  You can't not talk, Iraq.  I don't even know who Iraq's mad at.  I don't think he is.  He's just staring right back.  Iraq, who are you the most mad at?  I love that bit.  Me too.  And it better not be me again.  The list.  Start from the least mad, I would think.  I would love to.  As a guest, are you not mad at me?  That's good.  You're fine.  Thank you.  All right, there we go.  We got to see.  Wait, is he the least?  I'm the least, right?  He has nothing to do with anything.  Yes.  Let's not forget the way Troy came in here, stuck his nose in the business, and talked about 
[03:24:30]  how great Rob did today.  Troy was involved.  Come on.  I think finally I'm not going to be at the top of the list.  Who's next?  He's thinking.  No, he's thinking.  He's thinking.  He said he's not thinking.  He's shaking his head.  Come on.  Think.  Who is, what are we looking for?  From the least responsible up to the number one?  I place number one.  For Eric's unhappy mood.  Iraq, comment.  Who's next?  Who's next?  We love when you list this. 
[03:25:00]  You want all the names in front of you?  Do you want me to write the names?  Hold on.  I think I might work as a medium between Iraq and you guys.  Oh, yes.  I think I can contact the other side.  All right, here are all the names.  We love when Iraq has to list who he's the most pissed at after taking a meeting.  And in turn, Rob.  That's it, right?  And Sal.  And Sal.  Yeah, you're right, Sal.  That's right.  There's your names, Iraq.  Okay.  These are all the people that were in studio today. 
[03:25:30]  So move Dan Soder.  Dan Soder is the least.  We know that.  Move him over to the right side of the paper at the bottom.  How many people?  On to the right.  It's very difficult, Microsoft Word.  You're just giving the most complicated directions to Microsoft Word.  I want you to do a nice layout.  Yeah.  I need some graphics here.  I want a pie chart.  I want a PowerPoint.  All right.  You just knock them off the list.  That's all right.  Because it comes down to number one every time anyway.  Go ahead.  Who gets knocked off the list next? 
[03:26:00]  You want me to read the list?  Yes.  Anthony, Opie, Jim, Travis, Danny, Troy, Sam, Intern Rob, Sal.  Who is the least mad at on that list?  Least upset.  Come on, you rock.  I just need a name.  Just one name.  Come on.  Name from the list.  Anything?  Just play your part, please.  Yeah.  Come on.  It's a radio show.  Who's next?  Un nombre. 
[03:26:30]  Thanks, Kenny.  Just say the name.  Least mad at on the list.  I'm going to take a guess.  Might as well.  Well, we know Intern Rob, he's placing high.  He's placing very high.  He's placing very high.  The ones that aren't placing high, I would assume, are Danny, Travis.  I think Danny would probably be next. 
[03:27:00]  He didn't say much.  He was just videoing.  E-Rock, are you thinking or are you just not playing along?  Yeah.  At least tell us that much.  You got to play, Eric.  It's for the show.  Oh, man.  I don't think he's talking.  It's a radio show.  You can't not talk.  When I check on a fucking date where you're mad at somebody, this is a radio show.  Yeah, we all go.  You got to at least.  We all go way happy.  I'm saying it's Danny next.  Am I right?  I got it right.  All right.  Danny's off the list.  Danny's next.  We did get a thumbs up.  See, I am speaking to the other side.  You are, yeah.  Who gets off the list next? 
[03:27:30]  All right.  Danny.  I don't like that he's just picking people named Dan and putting them on the list.  He's just trying to figure out.  Great name.  Good name.  He's just trying to figure out how to make me number one again.  Travis?  Is Travis off the list?  But I also don't like that.  I mean, he should be doing something.  Travis is on the list.  I came in here and stuck up for you.  No, you didn't.  You started something the whole time.  I did not.  I just came in here and said that he had all those clips ready.  I'm next.  I'm on the list next.  I'm off the list.  Is it Jim?  What?  What?  Whoa.  Yeah, Jim, you're a pod team.  Okay. 
[03:28:00]  And Eric should be saying some of this because we're doing the thinking for him.  Yeah, come on.  That's terrible.  Was it Sam?  Is Sam?  No, Sam.  I didn't even do anything.  Don't ask us to do your simplistic work.  I know.  Anthony.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Iraq.  He's got corn cobs in his ears.  He's not listening to anything that anyone says.  Yeah.  He wants to make love to you or something.  What's that about?  Okay, so Anthony's off.  He took some major shots.  Trying to get you jealous.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I mean, that is insane. 
[03:28:30]  I have to be next.  Because Sam was instigating the whole thing.  How is that possible?  I didn't instigate anything.  No, Travis was instigating it.  Travis is still on the list and Anthony's not.  Yeah.  Travis took some shots.  Travis took some real shots.  It was heat of the moment.  Real shots.  The T-Rocs list, I have to be off the list next because I brought in yummy treats.  Oh, he says no.  Oh.  Oh.  Remember, he tried to throw away those delicious treats.  I know he did.  That was not nice.  Travis.  Yeah, it's got to be me.  But he's mixing.  Is it Travis's time?  What?  Wow.  Good.  Uh-oh.  So there's someone on the list.  Me, right? 
[03:29:00]  Is it Sal?  Opie.  It's Opie, isn't it?  Opie?  Opie.  Jim?  Troy?  Troy?  Dude, I was on the list.  I just wanted to say for the record, I was on my best behavior today.  That's your best?  Yeah, I was good today.  Yeah, you were.  I was, right, Jimmy?  Yes, you were.  Well, you, you know.  All right, Troy is off the list.  I mean, Troy was the one who was coming in saying how great the whole thing was that it was  happening, but okay.  All right.  My next guess is Opie.  No.  No, it's me.  No, so his bid is to make me number one. 
[03:29:30]  It should probably be me.  Why?  You were egging the whole thing on.  I wasn't egging the whole thing on.  Big piggy fatso.  No, I was just pointing things out.  I'm not talking.  I'm talking to him.  Sorry.  B-Rock, I got to take a phone call in the middle of this, because Dan Soder said something  there.  Mongo, the trucker, go ahead.  Dan can't work as a medium between B-Rock.  He has to work as an extra large.  I said that.  That's what Jimmy said.  Yeah, Mongo stole my line. 
[03:30:00]  Stole it.  I didn't hear you say that.  I didn't hear it.  I heard it.  That's hilarious.  That was funny when Mongo said it.  Does she want to say, Mongo?  Take us to break?  I swear I didn't hear you say that.  No, I know.  No, I don't think most of you would have.  All right, go ahead.  Could be, I guess I'll be next, right?  Oh, my God.  Travis.  Can't you vocalize this?  I think it's Jim.  Talk, Eric.  Is it Jim?  No, because I'll be on the list high thing, because he's annoyed at me, because I brought  me, yes. 
[03:30:30]  No, it's Sal.  No, Sal?  Sal?  Sal was taking shots at you and saying he does your work.  Sal doesn't matter.  Sal's off.  Oh.  Wow, Eric.  All right.  He's bad at this, but okay.  Sal.  I gave you some confidence.  Then, all right, I think it's going to go after Sal.  It's definitely got to be Jim.  No.  He's mad at me because of a couple of things.  He's also mad at me.  He's letting this later annoyance at me pointing out the blunder.  Which blunder?  Well, the one with the- 
[03:31:00]  The 10-year anniversary deal.  Yeah.  So that's kind of, that's affecting my overall status.  Sorry, but someone's got to fucking-  Intern Robbie's got to be the most furious at-  I would hope so.  Yeah.  And then I think definitely there's been talk of Sam-  Sam.  Aggravating him.  Then Travis.  Then Jim.  So I think it's-  So I think it's Opie's next.  Is Opie-  Yeah, Opie's off.  Whoa.  I told you I was on my best behavior today.  I didn't even do anything wrong.  Somebody's got to talk.  The meditation shit is working.  Eric doesn't talk.  Opie, and then- 
[03:31:30]  That's your Eastern philosophy, sir.  Yes.  Oh my God.  All right, so what's left is Jim, Travis, Sam, and Intern Rob.  Definitely Travis.  What?  I think it's going to be Travis next.  No.  Yeah!  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Top three for once.  Wait, you're more mad at me, you fucking-  You're more mad at me for the Rob, for the fucking Intern Piggy bitch?  I didn't do anything.  Oh my God.  All right, so-  No, Rob's still in there, because he brought the Piggy bitch.  No, I know that, but I'm saying, like, he's fucking- 
[03:32:00]  Why should you be off the list and Travis not?  Yeah, I didn't even just-  All right, maybe.  I think-  Now.  Is Sam off next?  No.  No.  Oh.  So then it's Jim.  Now it's Jim.  Jim's off.  But Jim made top three today.  Then Sam, then Rob.  That's impressive, yeah.  Yeah.  So why are you this mad at me?  What did I do?  You really were.  Because you're Sam Roberts.  Because you set up the whole bit, we all know.  Yeah.  You may believe that it was Intern Rob, but-  And you were saying a lot of bad things.  Now his spirit can be free.  Is that-  Who are you mad at more, me or Intern Rob? 
[03:32:30]  And don't do, like, what you think a bit would be.  Like, what do you really think, please?  If I thought I was doing a bit, you would have been one again.  Whoa!  Oh, somebody only says a few words, but he carries a big stick.  Whoa!  All right.  For real, who are you mad at next?  Well, it's got to be the winner now.  Sam, who are you more mad at, me or Intern Rob?  It would be Rob. 
[03:33:00]  Rob, yeah.  Okay.  Well, he did bring the whole bit.  Yeah, he did dress up like a pig.  And say he was nagling all over town.  You missed that, Dan.  All he did was laugh and encourage us.  And he was throwing egg McMuffins around the studio.  Oh, Jesus.  That was his impression of Eric.  I don't even know.  Sorry to bring it up again, Iraq, but Dan didn't know.  Yeah, I got here too late, but I don't think that's funny.  How about that?  Where are my top five?  I didn't-  Ah, fuck.  I'm still in the top five.  Well, you had that really good line.  Which one?  Which, by the way, Travis is bringing up again, Mr. Angry at Sam. 
[03:33:30]  Go ahead, Travis.  No, I'm just, I'm explaining to Opie why he might be in the top five.  Go ahead.  When, when, when Opie said that intern Rob was dressed exactly like Eric.  That is true.  He did a-  Let's get mad at Sam for that, right?  Nice, Eric.  Nice.  Let's get mad at Sam for when they're transitioning into something else.  Keep bringing up-  Why is there Monopoly money on the floor?  All right.  He really is a darn instigator.  Oh, he didn't want to let it go is what you're saying?  I was actually going to ask that question. 
[03:34:00]  Legitimately, I was like, why is there Monopoly money on the floor?  Why is there Monopoly money on the floor?  All right, but then you'd have been-  Yeah, then I'm-  And Ian, Ian in South Carolina wants to know why EROC is going to the Fez School of Broadcasting.  Oh.  See, because-  Why?  I didn't get that.  Oh.  I don't understand that one.  You really don't get that?  No, I just-  Eric, you get that, right?  Someone said to read that because it's good.  Dan Soder.  At Dan Soder.  It's S-O-D-E-R on Twitter, and of course-  I hate your last name.  All right, well, I'm sorry that when my grandfather moved here from Sweden, he didn't fucking change 
[03:34:30]  it for you.  I'm from Long Island, and the Long Island accent comes out-  Soder.  Soder.  Soder is saying Soder.  So I feel like-  Bobby cannot say it properly.  He says Soder.  Fucking Dan Soder.  Dan Soder.  That's his Boston thing.  Yeah, fucking Soder.  It could be one of the harder last names to say.  Dan Soder.  I don't hate it, though.  It's a gorgeous Swedish name.  Dan Soder.  Scoot, yeah.  Soder.  But thanks for having me on, guys.  Soder came in from the fjords with frozen fish sticks. 
[03:35:00]  By the way, you passed the audition.  You'll be back.  Awesome.  Some guys are only here one time, buddy.  Well, thank you very much.  This is-  I got an appointment.  I'd rather tell you a lie instead of behind your back.  Yeah.  I got an appointment.  I got a flight to catch.  All right.  Let's go.  See you guys.  You're out.  Cha-cha.  Cha-cha.  The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Fuck.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after 1A Live, it's next. 
[03:35:30]  Next.  Next.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is after 1A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That was a good show today.  That was a very good show today.  You know the phone number to call.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Obviously, 866-969-1969. 
[03:36:00]  Somebody on Feedback is quoting E-Rock.  The money makes it all worthwhile.  That was a quote that he did say to a fan once.  I don't know if he's feeling that way today.  We'll find out, though.  Dan Soder.  An exceptionally good first appearance by Mr. Dan Soder.  It's a hard room this O.P. and Anthony Show studio is to walk into.  For a new comedian, even if you've heard the show before, 
[03:36:30]  even if you know Bob Kelly and some of the other guys associated with the show,  it is a difficult room to walk into and for it to be your first appearance.  And Dan Soder shined.  And it was a weird show for him to walk into because it was a very sort of inside-centered show.  The intern's putting stuff away.  Sal, you've got to pick up the phones.  I know.  It's really tough for you, Sal.  I just told Connor to go in there.  Well, he's working on something.  He's on the phone.  Oh, Connor is in there?  I just saw him run down the hall.  My bad. 
[03:37:00]  Tell Sal to come out here.  Sal is too good to do phones now.  He could walk it off.  You don't like doing phones anymore?  I honestly haven't done phones in a very long time.  Eric said today that you did it for a little bit the other day.  Yeah, I answered maybe three phone calls.  All right.  Well, then don't lie.  Don't pull a fucking...  What's his name?  Don't pull a Rob the intern in here.  Don't pull a Rob.  Yeah.  Tell the truth.  All right.  I did do the phones recently.  Let's play What Did You Learn?  I'm going to go around the room. 
[03:37:30]  Ron and Fez, the intern, did you listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  I did.  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, great.  I listened to the tail end of it, yeah.  What did you learn at the tail end?  That's okay for you.  Never take the blame for someone else's problems.  Yeah.  I learned.  All right.  That's a good What Did You Learn?  Thank you.  Roland, you had your own little drama subplot today.  Lots of plots and subplots going on on the Opie and Anthony show today.  You had your own little subplot with what's his name, the football player.  Warren Sapp.  Warren Sapp, of course. 
[03:38:00]  I drew a blank on that for a moment.  And when it all comes down to it, they're like, nah.  What did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  I just learned that nobody cares.  About Warren Sapp?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  It's like, whatever.  They want him, then they're like, okay, we don't want him.  All right.  I don't care.  Right.  So he was just saying a month ago.  You're saying that they put you through the stress of being like, why isn't he in?  And then you bust your ass a little bit, and then it comes back to, ah, whatever. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  And that frustrates you.  Yeah, it frustrates anybody.  Yeah.  No, I get it.  It's not, you're not weird for it to frustrate you because, you know, you have to bust your  ass in doing this stuff.  And then it's like, I, you can't tell when something's important or not anymore is what you're  saying.  Yeah.  So I'm like, all right, I'll do it.  Then no, all right, whatever.  Did you hear the, uh, EROC stuff today?  No.  You, you missed the EROC stuff?  Yeah.  I was like waiting for a train, then got stuck and then waiting for another train.  You had a stressful day today.  Yeah, like, I didn't miss, I just got in when we went to commercial. 
[03:39:00]  Wow.  That's two hours in.  You must have had a stressful day.  Delayed trains and all that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  866-WOW1-WOW.  Call up with your what did you learn as well.  Because we got a couple I'm about to go to.  Sal?  I learned that, uh, the only real way to get truth out of intern Rob is to call his father.  Because there was two lies that we found even from then.  His handicap.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I wrote it down somewhere.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, I learned today that Sal has a terrible memory.  And he needs to write things down that just happened a couple hours ago. 
[03:39:30]  He can't even remember his own what did you learn.  That's true.  You know what else I learned?  That apparently you have a problem.  You're doing EROC's work and you don't like it.  It's not that I don't like it.  It's just that you brought it up very hostily with hostility.  John in Illinois, what did you learn?  Hey there, almighty Sam Roberts.  It's an honor to be on the greatest show on the radio.  Well, thank you, John.  It's an honor to talk to the greatest caller in all of Illinois.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  I learned that Rob, next to Sam Roberts, is the greatest intern ever. 
[03:40:00]  This is a great...  He might get two days of two hours of Rob.  This is a great point, John.  Thank you for calling in.  Is Rob the greatest intern of all time?  It's possible.  Rick in Ohio, what did you learn?  I learned that Jimmy Norton has turned into a little cunt for some reason.  Why do you...  He's bitching about everything and everybody on staff.  He's just...  And he's been doing it for the last couple days. 
[03:40:30]  He's got a problem with it.  Well, I mean, maybe he doesn't like the...  I think he's pretty vocal about what it is, though.  Yeah, but it's about little bullshit.  And he's just...  He just turned into...  He's a little 12-year-old snot-nosed cunt anymore.  But I still love him.  That's not...  Well, he probably hates you.  Because you just said things that were very insulting about him.  Oh, well.  He's used to it.  All right, Rick.  I don't know if Jim's a cunty.  But I know that, you know, as a performer, as a creative person, Jim likes things a certain way. 
[03:41:00]  And he just likes things to get done the way he thinks they should be getting done.  He's one of the hosts of the show.  And Opie and Anthony are kind of more...  Unless something is horribly going wrong, Opie and Anthony are generally, I think, sort of like,  Okay, we'll deal with it later.  I really don't want to deal with this and have a big conflict about it.  Unless it's an EROC problem, to be fair.  And Jim is more like, Look, there's something wrong here.  Let's deal with this. 
[03:41:30]  Fuck this shit.  Rick in Texas, what did you learn?  I learned that Anthony's weakness is not guns, ammo, booze, or even teenage pussies.  It's sausage McMuffins.  It is.  Anthony's real weakness is sausage McMuffins.  Who knew?  And thanks to intern Rob, we found that out.  Where is intern Rob?  Is he in there?  He's not in here.  Where is he?  I just saw him walking back up the hallway.  I don't know.  I don't.  I said you're not allowed in here.  You don't want him in there with you?  Wow. 
[03:42:00]  He's the boss.  Oh, he's in Troy.  What?  Eric, I kind of am afraid to ask you.  Did you learn anything today?  I learned that Dan Soder found out he was getting fired by hearing our last K-Rock show.  How fucking great was Dan Soder?  It was great.  I want to hang out with him.  Like, I want to talk about wrestling and radio with Dan Soder.  Like, I was just sitting there, like, while he was doing his Macho Man and Andre the Giant impressions  and talking about Hulk Hogan.  I was like, he's a funny comedian.  He likes wrestling.  I might want to date him.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if that's the emotion I'm feeling.  Eric, tell him to Twitter him. 
[03:42:30]  What?  He goes, Twitter me.  Twitter me.  I was like, if you need anything, Twitter me.  Eric, you told Dan Soder to...  No.  Roland walked in at the tail end of the conversation.  No, I was right there.  No.  He goes, hey...  Stop being needy.  Stop being needy.  No, no.  I was right there, you fuck.  I said, you have Roland's information.  Oh, boy.  And then you said, oh, if you need contact, you contact me, too.  So, fuck you.  This is a bad day for the two of them to be arguing.  Neither of them are in the mood.  Eric, were you trying to get Dan Soder to contact you?  No. 
[03:43:00]  I've talked to him plenty of times.  Roland says that you're trying to kind of...  And I said, do you have Roland's information?  Yes, he does.  And I said, okay, if you need anything else, let me know.  You can hit me on Twitter.  And that was it, because we've talked before.  Just focus on your thing.  Wow.  My God, the hostility in here today.  I love it.  I feel like I'm in a steam room right now.  It's relaxing.  It's nice.  It feels like it should.  Finally, we've got some life going on in here.  But hey.  Hey.  Go teamwork. 
[03:43:30]  This is what it's supposed to feel like.  Everybody at each other's throats.  Everybody's standing up for what they're...  If you're pissed off about something, come in here and talk about it today.  I want to know all about it.  Sal, you doing okay?  I'm doing good.  Good.  Yeah.  Rob, what did you learn?  I was going to say, Dan Sardin is a really good macho man impression.  Listen, Rob.  That was what I learned.  What I learned is that you are persona non grata around E-Rock in there.  You used to be Mr. E-Rock Party Room, but you came in here, you pushed his buttons, you  ratted him out about his party room. 
[03:44:00]  You did.  Yeah.  You took his free lunch.  Yeah.  And then you came in here and called him a piggy boy.  A big, fat, rich piggy boy is what you called him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you happy about that?  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  Go fuck yourself, asshole.  Whoa.  I'm sorry.  You're the little douchebag dipshit in his golf clothes that gets the shit beat out of  him at your all gay boy high school.  I never got the shit beat out of him.  Right.  Okay.  Where was this E-Rock?  I love it. 
[03:44:30]  Tell him what it is, Eric.  He should get it.  You know, I would dismantle him if he came in here with an Afro wig and a wrestling t-shirt  on being like, hey guys, I don't know how to Google.  I'd be like, step the fuck out of this room before you get hurt, young man.  It's not going to happen.  I love that E-Rock finally gave you something.  That's why I push him so much.  I want the fucking fire.  Yeah.  You feel a fire in here, don't you, Troy?  Oh yeah.  You love it, don't you?  I love this shit.  And Roland's going after E-Rock because Roland's in a bad mood too.  I love that. 
[03:45:00]  I love when Roland's fired up, man.  He's in a bad mood today.  I love it.  I love it.  Because he's in a bad mood.  His train got delayed.  He comes in here.  They're giving him shit about Warren Sapp.  He has to run around the building.  He gets everything squared out and they go, nah, I don't care about him.  Yeah.  And he's like, what the fuck do you guys want from me?  Roland's going nuts.  I love it.  I have to get things signed for fuck everything.  What?  Who do you have to get things signed for?  Well, I was here till 4.30 to get things signed.  For who?  Really?  I'm assuming it was one of the hosts of the show. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Will you tell me that?  It was one of the hosts.  Yeah.  And we'll say Opie and Anthony don't like autographs.  We'll say that?  Yeah, but it's fine.  Okay.  Okay.  So you're not saying that you were put out by that, but you were here late because you  were getting autographs for Jim.  Yeah.  That's fair.  And so you're a little cranky.  Yeah, because when I went home, the 7th fucking train, empty assholes, the train was down.  And then you got to come back here.  No, I had to go meet a friend for dinner.  So then I had to get a cab to go home, change, and go back in the city to see the friend for dinner.  Because they're only in town for, because they had to fly back to L.A. 
[03:46:00]  And then the train was still down.  So I'm like, fuck me.  Fuck you, indeed.  And then you come back and finally get back to the studio.  And they're like, oh, Roland, fuck you.  Where's Warren Sapp?  Yeah, I say fuck everybody today.  That's what you do today?  Is a fuck everybody day?  I'm going home early.  You can't sit anywhere, Roland, today, because everywhere you go is a dick in the ass, isn't  there?  That's why at 11 o'clock I'm going to go home.  Right after this show?  I just don't care anymore.  Good for you.  Good for you, Roland.  Troy, did you learn anything today?  Well, I was, can I say that I was surprised by something? 
[03:46:30]  Instead of learning something?  Absolutely.  I was surprised Eric didn't have a sausage McMuffin.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  This is the guy you're not mad at, Eric.  No, I didn't.  This is the guy.  Anyway, he's still taking his shots, and this is the guy.  No, I was just, I was shocked.  Sausage McMuffin's right in the ass.  He is, he sees you in a position that you're in, and he's deciding now is the time to take  shots.  Yeah, because he couldn't do it on the air.  No, I did on the air.  I did on the air.  Oh, good Lord. 
[03:47:00]  Mark in Oregon.  Morning, Sam.  Morning, Mark.  I learned if you bring in a cheap fucking breakfast, you can take a big shit all over your butt.  That is a great lesson.  You did.  You brought in a cheap breakfast.  There's hash browns and egg McMuffins.  It's just egg McMuffins.  No hash browns.  And you got to, you didn't bring a hash browns.  No.  You just egg McMuffins.  Egg McMuffins are two bucks.  Two for four dollars.  I got twelve of them.  I'm proud of this kid.  You're proud of him. 
[03:47:30]  Well, because you remember on the after show after he took his beating the other day,  he said he was going to come back.  By the way, my thought of Kevvy being number one intern, out the window.  Of course.  Rob may be number one of all time.  And who called it?  You did try.  Thank you.  You did try.  I backed you from the fucking get-go.  And you better not let me down tomorrow, and you better not let me down Friday.  Of course not.  What did you learn, Brian?  Brian, what did you learn?  Hey, I learned that Jim Norton used to have a cat named John, which I think is ironic.  That's the code name for somebody who purchases prostitutes. 
[03:48:00]  That's true.  He had a cat named John, and now he is one.  Stan in Iowa.  What did you learn?  Hey, Sam.  I learned that Obie's kid thinks E-Rock's a monster.  E-Rock, is that what would help get Norton very high up on the angry list that he made  references to Obie's kid calling you a monster?  It didn't help the situation, though.  Why did I get so high up on the list?  Because you don't shut up.  It's a talk show, right?  No, but you shit stir.  It's a talk show, right? 
[03:48:30]  I mean, what else are we doing?  You do shit stir, though.  Well, what are we here?  To talk about the fucking news of the day, or are we here to make some shit happen?  Even with Bird, you're like, take another shot.  Take another shot.  Yeah.  In Chicago, run through the fountain.  I'm here to have some fun.  That's what life is about.  Yeah.  If life isn't about mixing some shit up, I don't know what it is about.  Right, Troy?  Exactly.  Troy, we bro down.  Yeah.  We hang out.  We compliment each other well.  Yeah.  You shit stir, too.  Love it.  It's what life's all about.  Troy has Miami McFly hair.  Miami McFly got the bitches, so it's okay. 
[03:49:00]  What's up?  Or the his dad.  But this is what I never understand.  Like, are we all supposed to just pretend we like each other?  Are we supposed to...  You know what happens when I shit stir?  The shit that was already there just comes to the surface.  It's not like anything's made up.  The real shit comes out.  It's about time some of that was happening.  Do you know how much endless hours of radio have been provided because of Sam?  Yeah.  And it was all based in reality.  Now, I'm sorry if I am the one who has to put myself on the cross for it, but I'm willing 
[03:49:30]  to do it because I am the savior of all of you people out there.  No, Jason Shapiro is.  No, he's just Jewish.  It's different.  If you're pissed off at Sam, just go after Sam.  Yeah, come at me.  Come at me, bro.  I ain't mad at you.  Uh, Justin in New Jersey, what did you learn?  Hey, Sam, how's it going?  I learned that, uh, Travis is not only the doctor of day, but he's the doctor of sales.  And I hope you're ready for this.  Yeah.  We are a month and a half away from Jocktober, man. 
[03:50:00]  I cannot wait.  You know, Justin, I'm already making notes.  We got a taste of Jocktober yesterday when we were doing War of the Roses.  And E-Rock actually did some good producer work, and he emailed me a list of websites  of radio stations that are actively doing War of the Roses, but I held that off.  I said, you guys do your little Ryan Seacrest War of the Roses, and you wait and see what  I've got in store for you come Jocktober, because Jocktober 1st is not far away.  We're just over a month, and we're doing it again, and we're doing it big, because every 
[03:50:30]  year it's gotten bigger and better, and it's a big challenge because it's a favorite of  everybody out there.  Anybody from this radio station?  I don't know if I can Jocktober anyone from this radio station without, I mean, I would  have to Jocktober me.  I'm probably the worst show on the channel.  Who would you Jocktober on the station?  Steve Sterniolo.  Oh, you mean on the platform?  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  You're talking about Steve Sterniolo from Raw Dog?  Yeah.  You think he should be Jocktobered?  Jocktober!  He sucks, you think?  Jocktober!  Why do you think he sucks? 
[03:51:00]  I don't think.  Jocktober!  Eric in Chicago?  Chicago?  Chicago.  Great city, by the way.  Yo, Sam.  What's up, dude?  What's up, buddy?  Yo, first off, I'd like to recommend that fucking asshole man, Cal, for Jocktober, without  a doubt.  And I think the new guy, Rob, is much-needed new blood to the show besides being a fucking  liar.  I think he's a cool guy.  Oh, well, thank you.  He does.  He does.  He brings something different to the show. 
[03:51:30]  It's the kind of douchey, rich kid, but not that douchey.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, he is a douchey, rich kid.  Yeah.  But, he's kind of aware of it, and he's like, okay, let's go.  Let's run with it.  Let's go forward, then.  And he's not, like, doing things that are that douchey.  Like, he'll do some stupid shit, too.  Which is nice.  Something that the show needs.  Guys will, like, how many guys will come in here in a pig suit?  Why would you think that was a good idea, first of all?  You came in here.  Rob, the intern, walks in here.  He's got a pink Snuggie on. 
[03:52:00]  And it's altered with duct tape and staples, so it looks like a pig outfit.  He's wearing a plastic pig nose.  I don't know if you heard about this, Roland.  He's wearing a plastic pig nose.  He's got a bag full of Egg McMuffins, and he's throwing Monopoly money up in the air,  saying something to the effect of, let's get nagled in this bitch.  I'm nagling this bitch.  Why would you think that was a good idea?  I don't know.  It just...  It wasn't a good idea? 
[03:52:30]  That turned out to be a great idea.  But on paper...  Okay, now I understand why he's really pissed.  Now you understand why he's hitting you back.  Yeah, I didn't know.  And then we spent two hours kind of blaming Eric for not putting this intern down.  Taking him, literally, taking him out back behind the shed and putting him down.  Oh, yeah.  Old yeller style.  He definitely should have.  I like this kid, man.  He picked himself up off of a bad day on Monday.  Yeah, but Troy, let's say you're the intern boss.  Right.  Which, didn't Eric, didn't you say that Troy is going to be the intern boss? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  Were you being sincere when you said that after your week vacation next week, you're going  to come back and not be the intern boss anymore?  That's the goal.  Is that the goal or are you going to resign from it?  It's been discussed.  It has been discussed?  Yes.  With management?  Yeah.  What do they think of it without getting into specifics?  They said to do what I have to do.  Interesting.  Troy, is that a responsibility you would take on?  That means no blood in their hands.  No way. 
[03:53:30]  What would you do if you were an intern boss?  And that happened to me.  And you went through a whole semester and you were kind of, you know.  What happens?  It'll be like fucking fashion week here.  We were all kind of goofing on you behind your back.  Right.  You knew that was happening.  But you were trying to put these interns on the right path.  Right.  And Rob had come in and he'd been taking some little shots at you throughout the last couple  weeks.  And then today he walks in and his hair is brushed down over his eyebrows.  And he's, you know, got Crayola marker tattoos on his arms.  And he's going, rock it, bro. 
[03:54:00]  And like Anthony said, he's throwing his cum everywhere or whatever.  Whatever the, you know.  I mean, if it was funny, it's funny.  But would you be like, and then the rest of us started going, Troy, you look like a  fucking asshole right now.  What are you going to do about it?  I would have blasted him and I would have given him a stupid assignment to go do.  Yeah.  You know?  E-Rock, do you regret anything about how you handled today?  Or do you still feel that you did what you could?  No, I regret not punching him in the face. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  You're not supposed to.  You can't.  You can't punch people in the face.  You're not supposed to punch him in the face.  Just use your word.  Do you really want to hit him?  Like want to, not going to.  You can say you want to hit him.  Oh, I do want to hit him.  Badly.  Badly.  Are you, you've been very mad at a lot of people.  You've been very mad at me.  Yeah.  Is this the most annoying thing that somebody's done to you on the air?  I think the most annoying thing somebody's done to you associated with the show has  to be Opie leaving you at Giant Stadium at that concert.  That's probably number one, is it? 
[03:55:00]  But that wasn't on the air, though.  It wasn't on the air, but just people associated with the show.  Is that probably number one, Eric?  Um, you know what?  I don't even know at this point.  Do you, do you think.  You can't hit Opie, though.  No, he loves Opie.  He does.  Do you think, do you think what Rob did today was the number one worst thing that somebody's  done to you on the air?  I'd say taunting-wise.  No, I don't think so.  Even factoring in the insubordination angle?  Even factoring in the-  He said no.  Even factoring in the you-bought-him-lunch angle? 
[03:55:30]  No, it doesn't mean I'm not pissed at him.  Right.  But I-  Look, this show has done a lot of shitty things to me.  That's true.  So I don't know if this is at the top.  I mean, this is number one.  Do you have any idea, like, what is around number one?  Huh.  I mean, I know it's been a lot.  Let's see.  You think about it.  Steve in Texas, what did you learn?  Hey, I learned that E-Rock did nothing to stop the Titanic from sinking, to stop Pearl Harbor 
[03:56:00]  from being attacked, or to stop 9-11.  E-Rock, couldn't you have done something with Pearl Harbor?  All those guys got bombed?  I'll try harder next time.  Okay, thank you.  See, when I do it, it's okay.  When Jim does it, you get all upset.  Skylar in Wyoming?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I think Rob is probably my favorite intern of all time.  Wow.  Thank you.  The four hours of radio he provided this week alone-  This week alone.  Number one, no matter what, man. 
[03:56:30]  He comes in Monday and gets just shit on for two and a half hours.  Yeah.  He comes back and takes a gigantic dump on him.  I had to pull over three times from pitching myself on glasses so fucking hard.  Yeah, I-  I'm killing this, bitch.  I can't, thank you, Skylar.  I can't imagine.  And maybe I'm biased, but I can't, like, fathom.  And I said it on the air a little bit.  Did he have Monopoly money?  He was throwing Monopoly money in the air all over the place.  That's on Twitter.  He implied.  Is it?  He implied that E-Rock was a fat, rich piggy boy. 
[03:57:00]  That makes it rain.  That makes it rain and hands out breakfast sandwiches for favors.  I said this on the air.  For favors?  Well, to gain favor, we'll say that.  Not sexual favors.  I can't fathom, I can't talk to, I can't understand anybody who hasn't thoroughly enjoyed both two-hour segments that Rob provided this week.  Anybody who doesn't think that was great radio, I would encourage them to unsubscribe to satellite radio. 
[03:57:30]  Let me ask you a question.  Okay.  Okay, so with the odds, though it's going on now, so Rob bounced back.  Yeah.  Does he go for it?  Does he go for the gold for the next two days?  Honestly.  Or does he just sit in the cut?  I believe he has the gold.  He sits in the cut.  And he just kind of takes a bath in all the glory.  Unless somebody comes back at him tomorrow and he has to recover from it.  As long, he is gold right now.  He already got the gold.  This wasn't a bronze or silver performance today.  This was gold. 
[03:58:00]  But what's saying he wants the second medal?  Well, nobody gets one two-hour segment.  Nobody gets two two-hour segments.  If you think you can do it a third time, you're running the risk of getting greedy.  But what happens if it's just even more magnificent?  Well, what's he going to do?  I mean, but what's Kevvy going to do?  Nothing.  Yeah, exactly.  So you're probably fine.  Yeah, but I want to...  But it's not like you can do another two-hour segment making fun of E-Rock.  No, I know.  And you're not going to fuck with me.  No, I would never.  I don't want to fuck with anybody. 
[03:58:30]  So how are you going to get by then?  That was your whole shtick.  And today would have fallen on its ass if E-Rock hadn't been like...  Hadn't not done anything.  You know what I mean?  Like you really got lucky when E-Rock wasn't able to come back at you strong.  So, and E-Rock, I hope you don't mind me saying that.  Apparently he does.  Derek.  It's like that.  With all due respect.  Derek, what did you learn?  Hey, I learned that SiriusXM pays you guys way too much money and you are running a daycare center. 
[03:59:00]  Look, we may be running a daycare center, but we can definitely object when it comes to finances  because I'm pretty sure daycare workers are making more.  We're at Keith in Connecticut.  We do have naps.  Yeah, we do get nap time.  What's up, Keith?  Eric, I'm not sure why you ever got on the radio.  Everybody that asks you a question, they have to drag the answer out of you.  And when you do answer it, you answer with little two or three words.  I mean, could you at least try to get a sentence out or answer a question?  Okay, douchebag.  Fuck off. 
[03:59:30]  Fuck you, asshole.  Oh, you listen to the big tough guy who wants to talk now, huh?  Oh, listen to the big tough guy on the fucking phone.  How about you do a radio show this intense for eight years when you get to the point where  you go, well, if I go this direction, it's going to be bad.  If I go this direction, it's going to be bad.  So you take the path of least resistance on some of this shit and let them go over.  Good.  Keep paying my salary, asshole.  You do love that.  You do love that cash, Eric.  You love that that money comes back to that pocket, don't you?  I don't bring this shit up.  That point I did, but I never bring that shit up ever. 
[04:00:00]  Did he bring it up in Chicago?  He brought it up to that guy in Chicago.  You did bring it up to that guy in Chicago.  So what Rob did today was not entirely off.  What, throwing the money around?  I don't know if Eric literally threw the money around.  Metaphorically, though, it's not far off.  Do you guys think, let me, Troy, you haven't been here as long as everybody else.  Would you say Sal?  Not Sal.  Sal's definitely not the best intern.  Would you say Rob?  And this includes Sal, by the way.  Is Rob the best intern that we've had under your watch? 
[04:00:30]  Rob is up there.  After today.  Yeah.  Rob is definitely up there.  Sal just did his work.  Sal did a good job doing his work.  Did is the big phrase there.  Because we also, one of the things, the big things we learned today in all this melee is what a real kind of strikeout Sal has been as an employee.  That was brought up a few times today, wasn't it, Sal?  Yeah, I think it was like two or three times.  Yeah, what a real kind of downgrade.  From Sal the intern to Sal the employee, big time downgrade. 
[04:01:00]  But that's happened before, right?  Yeah, but those employees aren't around anymore, are they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't think Sal ever has the balls that Rob did.  Rob is better than Sal as an intern.  As an intern, Sal.  You're not an intern anymore, so don't take it.  I'm not as concerned about doing bits like that, you know what I mean?  That's not my thing.  What, making the show good?  Yeah.  Is Rob the best intern?  Yeah.  Rowan?  Rob, best intern of all time?  I don't care.  You're still kind of pissed about Warren Sapp in the train. 
[04:01:30]  Or Dave.  Intern David.  Yeah.  Good call.  I do like David.  Can you kill me and me laugh?  How about this?  Rob versus Cream Pie Jones.  I've never liked Cream Pie.  He sucked, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I picked Rob.  Rob never had to play with PCs to get over.  Thank God.  Sal?  Yeah.  Best intern of all time, including yourself.  Is it Rob?  I mean, it depends.  How many?  Best one.  Number one, baby.  Who's number one?  Who's going for the gold?  Yeah, I still think I was a better intern than Rob was.  Okay, well, you're just fucking biased. 
[04:02:00]  That doesn't matter.  That's ridiculous.  No, but how many interns...  Eric, could you do me a favor and ask Connor who the best intern of all time was?  Connor, who's the best intern of all time?  Oh, God, Rob.  Tell Connor I 100% agree with him.  He 100% agrees with you.  Thanks, Sam.  And tell him that I'm sorry that that also includes him.  Should Rob hug it out, though?  With Eric?  They're not getting anywhere near each other today.  Did you tell Connor that I'm sorry that that includes him?  Yeah, I did.  Okay.  Eric?  Yeah? 
[04:02:30]  If you can take yourself out of the equation, can you put Rob amongst the top two interns?  I will put him...  Can you put him up there with intern David?  Nope.  Wow.  Will you put him in top five interns of all time?  Nope.  Is Rob the worst intern of all time?  Second to worst.  Who's the worst?  Well...  Who's the worst?  The one we don't name anymore.  I don't even know who that is.  The one fucking beach bombing in Tampa.  Jim?  Mike?  Yeah.  Yes.  Hang on.  Jim's on the phone.  I received a Twitter that I've been taking shots on this after show.  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:03:00]  Some caller called up and said that you were being cunty, and I said that you were not  being cunty, that you just had issues with certain things that the staff was doing.  Oh, it was a caller?  Yeah, it was a caller.  Nobody's...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I do...  The fact that I responded and I found out it was a caller, I actually feel like I heard  a noise, and I got up in the middle of the night, and then someone goes, no, it was  a fart.  I'm like, no.  All right.  What was that?  I'll see you guys later.  All right, later.  Bye.  Yeah, I mean, you Twitter people, learn how to shit stir, okay? 
[04:03:30]  Like, the point...  Listen, take a lesson from me, you fucking Twitter shit stirrers, because you don't have  the fucking Sam Roberts juice that I have.  I think the people that got confused, I was pissed at the MTA, not at Jimmy, because of  any way.  Yeah, and we made it clear.  We said, Roland was here late getting autographs for Jim, so he was cranky today, meaning he  was here late, and when you're here late, for whatever reason, you're cranky the next  day.  Yeah, I don't care about saying late, though.  It was the MTA that fucked me over.  Listen, shit stirrers on Twitter, you little internet pirates. 
[04:04:00]  What you have to realize is, when you stir the shit, you better make sure there's some  shit there.  If you're just trying to start conflict and there is none, then all that happens is,  you go, oh, no, that's not the case.  Oh, okay, cool.  And that's the end of it.  And you waste Jim Norton's time.  He's a man with valuable time.  If you want to stir some shit, make sure that there is something actually there.  That's what I do.  And you know what happens?  Shit fucking blows up all over the place.  There's brown doodoo all over these walls.  It's disgusting in here, but it's wonderful, too. 
[04:04:30]  Are we out of time, Eric?  Yeah, we gotta go.  All right.  Well, Eric, I hope tomorrow's a better day for you.  Yeah, we'll see.  And anything you want to say to Rob before we go?  Nice knowing you, Rob.  Is he going to be back on Thursday, Friday?  Eric?  It's a shrug.  Oh, boy.  He'll be back.  He'll be back?  You think Eric's all talk?  He's not even talk, is he?  No.  Rob, you feel good about today or bad about today? 
[04:05:00]  Honestly.  Tell me the truth.  I mean...  Do you feel great about today?  I do feel pretty.  I mean, I'm just...  That's the right answer, Rob.  I'm just not...  You may be...  You are among the greatest interns of all time.  Why thank you.  Roland?  I hope you're out of that funk.  Sal?  You guys have been proven to do.  We all know that.  And Troy?  Thank you for your contributions, as always.  Thank you, Peppa Head.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
