<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony detailing a tumultuous weekend stemming from a minor red wine spill on a flight from Cleveland with his girlfriend. This escalated into a full-blown argument, exacerbated by an unsuccessful Apple Store trip, culminating in Anthony throwing his phone and getting a separate hotel room.  Upon returning home, his girlfriend’s heavy drinking led to an involuntary 72-hour psychiatric hold, a situation Anthony described in graphic detail, including the hospital’s conditions and his frustrating attempts to secure her release. He discussed the perceived financial incentives for extended hospital stays and legal ramifications, drawing parallels to the Terrell Owens incident.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton were in studio, fielding numerous calls offering varied advice, including some outlandish suggestions. A psychiatric nurse called in with advice, while a caller, Nicky, criticized the show’s tone.  Oscar De La Hoya made a surprise in-studio appearance, engaging in a humorous conversation about boxing with the hosts and Rich Vos, who was also present. The show promoted a Jerry Springer "Dancing with the Stars" campaign and a Doug-related video on OAXperience.com. “Club Soda Kenny” performed "Secret Agent Man." Frequent interruptions from calls, instant messages, and the hosts characterized this segment.

The next segment focused on Anthony's continued frantic efforts to get his girlfriend released, marked by increasingly angry phone calls with hospital staff and exasperated outbursts. Opie and Jim Norton, along with Rich Bonny and Mike Kenny, provided commentary.  Efren Ramirez (Pedro from *Napoleon Dynamite*) was a guest, briefly discussing his career before being interrupted by Anthony’s calls.  The hosts also discussed a recurring radio contest and shared a humorous anecdote about an exceptionally loud fart in an elevator.  Anthony remained preoccupied with his girlfriend's situation throughout the segment.  Upcoming guests, Arlie Ermey and Matthew Modine, were mentioned.

A "Daily Dump Report," read by Kenny, followed, detailing the bathroom breaks of Anthony, a rude caller, and surprisingly, Oscar De La Hoya.  Kenny again performed a comical rendition of "Secret Agent Man."  The show then pivoted to a heated confrontation with JV and Elvis, the hosts of the following radio show, who criticized Opie and Anthony for running late.  Audio clips of JV and Elvis's show were played, revealing insults and accusations from both sides.  Anthony left the studio for a portion of this segment, occasionally calling in.  The argument centered on claimed dishonesty, accusations of stolen ideas, and attacks on each other’s ratings and show formats, punctuated by personal attacks, homophobic slurs, and threats of physical violence.  The hosts debated the validity of each other’s criticisms, with Opie and Anthony emphasizing the increased listenership JV and Elvis likely gained due to their extended show. Pothead Ed called in to support Opie and Anthony, and Gilbert Gottfried made a brief appearance.  The segment concluded with unresolved conflict and lingering animosity.  The show also included a giveaway of "I took a boner pill" t-shirts,  and a discussion of YouTube videos including Craig and Big Ronda.

The final segment involved a discussion concerning Anthony's angry outbursts and the potential consequences of continuing the segment. One host decided to leave early, leaving the remaining hosts to end the broadcast with a brief, expletive-laden outro referencing "Radio for the Angry Golfer." No guests were present during this concluding portion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Despicable human beings in the country. Creeps. Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  O.P.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Who's Jimmy?  I don't know.  Where's Jimmy Norton?  Where's Jimmy?  They're calling and he's not answering his phone. 
[00:01:30]  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared.  There he is.  He made it.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  Hi, Jimmy.  Strap in, Jimmy.  Oh.  Strap in.  I'm livid.  Strap in, Jimmy.  Yeah, buckle up, kids. 
[00:02:00]  It's going to be a bumpy ride.  If you're looking for the funny out of me, F off.  I'm in no mood.  No mood.  Hey, where's the...  I'm looking for this clip.  I can't find it.  All right.  Let me make sure this works.  Okay.  Got to make sure the beep works. 
[00:02:30]  All right, here we go.  And I may slip, so Al, be on the guard.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Yeah.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:03:00]  And this...  Well, we were on Best Up.  Oh.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  Remember this guy.  Nothing works.  What medication do you have?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Nothing works here.  Nothing works here.  Sure.  The medications don't work.  Okay, go with me.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I'm going to have you lie down over here.  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay? 
[00:03:30]  The medications don't work.  Put your leg back on your stretcher.  Nothing works here.  All right, in here.  I hate this place.  Okay.  Nothing works here.  I now believe that that guy was completely sane.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, good morning.  It's the ONA virus and it's spreading across America with hilarity for all.  Hilarity.  This saga starts when I was leaving Cleveland. 
[00:04:00]  That's where this whole thing starts.  That's why I had to call up and say I wasn't going to be attending the Opie and Anthony show yesterday.  It starts, innocently enough, leaving Cleveland.  It was an unexpected day off for everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were in best of yesterday.  And I think it was a really bad best of because it's what's called a emergency best of.  Ah.  One that's still like it just in case of emergency. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Break glass.  Break glass.  Play this crap for the people.  Yeah.  That's what they got yesterday.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Because usually when we take a day off or have a vacation planned, we go through the archives  and make sure it's a great, great show for everybody.  And if one more mother f*** comes in here and asks me, how are you?  You feel all right?  Because I guess you take a day off and everyone, someone says I was sick or something. 
[00:05:00]  Was I ill?  Well.  Who said that?  Can't you just say he took a day off?  He had stuff to do.  Well, I think people were reading into it because we all have been sick since Cleveland.  Heavy colds.  Steve can't talk.  Jimmy was sick.  I don't take sick days.  Holy Jesus Christ.  There was one time back in.  96 maybe.  Holy Christ.  You notice no one's in the studio today. 
[00:05:30]  Good.  They're all hiding.  They're under counters.  They're in back offices.  I am an atomic bomb today.  So if I'm f***ed with at all, I'm going off.  I may even just leave.  I never wished that we could, like, switch the shows and start on XM more than today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Because believe me, I want to curse.  Because by the time we get to XM, he might be almost calm.  This would be great on Censored.  This would be the greatest hour of radio on Censored. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, would it be?  What's the matter, sweetie?  Well, as I said, it started innocently enough in Cleveland.  Flying home.  You know, the road shows are nice.  They're fun.  Everything like that.  But, and whatever you want to say, go screw.  It's, it's like the traveling and stuff.  And that's not my bag.  I don't like, like, I like traveling.  I like going on vacation, doing things like that, doing things I want to do. 
[00:06:30]  Travel days, especially going home, they kind of just suck.  You know?  I don't, I don't enjoy them much, but it's not a big deal.  And especially, you know, when you have a nice seat in the aircraft.  And a nice glass of red wine.  This is how ridiculous this whole thing starts off.  It started with a glass of red wine?  It started with a glass of red wine.  It ends so ridiculously that it's like some kind of horror movie that you can't step out of. 
[00:07:00]  That you never saw the ending come of.  I, I defy anybody to tell me, based on the beginning of this story, how it ends.  Okay?  So.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Shut up.  Oh, I know, though.  Darn it.  A little glass of red wine next to me.  You know, for the flight.  And they give you, it's like, you know, a little glass.  So my girlfriend's next to me and she's asleep on the plane. 
[00:07:30]  I'm really tired, too, because, you know, it's very exhausting, those shows.  Drink.  Take a little sip off my red wine.  And so my girlfriend wakes up and moves.  And because the seats aren't as big on a 737, not much room.  She hits the wine.  It, it spills all over me.  All over me.  I, my socks, my, my, my pants, shirt. 
[00:08:00]  I, I couldn't imagine, because they don't give you much, how little bit of an amount of liquid could go so everywhere on somebody.  Now, me, I explode.  Not at her.  I explode because I'm covered now for the rest of the flight in red wine.  So it's, it's all over me.  I'm grabbing blankets and pillows, trying to sop it up.  But, you know, to no avail.  And I'm cursing.  Again, not at her.  I'm just cursing.  Like, you know, all the curse words are flying out of me. 
[00:08:30]  God damn, I'm covered with this.  So at some point now, because she's aggravated and tired, turns and goes, could you just shut up about the wine and stuff?  I go, oh, fine.  You know, you, you spilt it on me.  So we have, we have a little tiff.  We have a little tiff, which is fine.  An FU, FU fight.  No, not even.  It was kind of an FU, whatever kind of thing like that.  Right.  Now, let me add this to the story.  Me and my girlfriend been together for over seven years. 
[00:09:00]  For seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  We have not had a fight in seven years.  I'm not kidding you.  We've, we've, you have like little, like you throw a little bar about something maybe, but never a blowout argument.  Maybe a little tiff here and there.  Yeah, barely.  I'm talking not an argument.  We get along swimmingly.  It's amazing to tell you the truth that we go seven, over seven years without a fight. 
[00:09:30]  Compared to the past relationship, I do find that amazing.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Because I was discussing this in my little private life going, man, you know, I used to, I used to watch Anthony fight.  Oh.  All the time.  Oh.  All the time.  The, the, the, yeah, the ex was just an abomination to live with.  The famous vacuum story where when Ant and I used to commute and we looked pretty close to each other, pull up to his house at nine in the morning.  And, uh, there's a huge fight going on on the front porch. 
[00:10:00]  And I'm like, Anthony, why are you guys fighting?  Obviously you just woke up.  What could you have possibly done to start a fight, uh, this early in the morning?  Yeah.  And it was over the fact that you didn't vacuum before you went to work.  Sorry.  I'm just comparing it to the old days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Believe me.  The new Anthony, there's no fighting.  We got a lot of it.  Right.  We get along amazingly.  Amazing.  I like the word swimmingly.  Amazingly.  You had a bit of a spat because of the accidental wine spill and you're both tired and cranky. 
[00:10:30]  Tired and cranky is key.  So we land, leave the plane, the silent, uh, car ride to the hotel.  Yeah.  The silent, uncomfortable car ride to the hotel.  Uh, we get out.  She goes, I'm going to my girlfriend's house.  We're going to the movies.  As I'm in the lobby with the bags and everything.  So I'm just like, okay, you know, whatever.  Cool off.  We'll cool off. 
[00:11:00]  It'll be great.  Got to add to the story.  You flew home from Cleveland and decided to stay in Manhattan.  Yeah.  That would make it a lot easier to get to work on Monday.  The next day.  You really wanted to be at your house on Long Island.  Of course.  So that, that certainly adds to it as well.  Yeah.  More just aggravation building up.  Oh, that lot.  Okay.  The lobby of the hotel.  I still defy anyone to tell me where this ends.  Well, I know.  You know, I know, you know, they knocked on your door and took your, uh, the FAA took  you away.  No, no, man.  And I don't even look for the sound, sound effect. 
[00:11:30]  Not into it.  So the FAA didn't get involved.  No.  See, I got to play the part of the listeners here.  Cause a lot of people are thinking FAA at this point.  And I hope they're, I hope the people on PalTalk are learning.  I've already bounced eight people just for the hell of it.  I erased my memory.  Yeah.  Cause I want to be the listener here.  Cause they're, cause they're guessing.  They all get, they are guessing.  So no to the FAA.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hotel.  She's going good.  Kind of cool off thing.  I go up to the hotel room with the bags and everything. 
[00:12:00]  And, uh, I figure I'm going to cool down.  I've wanted, um, to buy one of those really, really nice, uh, Mac books, the top of the  line ones, because I do a lot of video and stuff and audio editing.  So I go down to the Apple store.  Now this isn't any dig on Apple, but it's just another straw, just another straw on the poor  little camel's back.  I go down there.  I'm looking for something very specific that I need. 
[00:12:30]  It's the top of the line, 17 inch glossy monitor for graphics, two gigs of Ram, everything.  And the signs are all over.  Take it home tonight.  We have it.  There's 18 billion people in the place, 18 billion computers, everything you could possibly  want, except the one I wanted.  Typical.  Typic.  Oh.  Because I'm already in a tiff.  You got to curse a little bit.  No, I'm, I'm ready. 
[00:13:00]  I was ready down the hole.  Believe me, it might happen.  All right.  I was ready though.  You got to let a few fly because, you know, you got to get it out.  I know.  I know.  All right.  Come on.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  Hold, hold, hold on.  This might take a little longer because, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Wow.  You're a regular too.  Bye bye.  Bouncy, bouncy.  Wrongy, wrongy.  Jim, what's in the post today?  Shut up.  What'd they do? 
[00:13:30]  They, they, they actually instant message you during that?  Well, it's pal talk and they're all yapping and, you know, doing stuff.  Doing things, speculating, trying to make fun.  And I just bounce people because that's what I could do today.  So that was like part of it.  So now I'm just, because then I would have had the, uh, MacBook would have gone back to  the hotel room, start, you know, fiddling around with it and cool down.  It would have been a distraction.  Distraction.  Instead, it was another trigger.  Thank you, Opie. 
[00:14:00]  But no.  Another trigger.  I take the walk down there.  It's not, and I walk out empty handed.  My distraction, not there.  So I go to the hotel.  I'm just, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm fuming at the fact that this is, is getting, it's building,  you know?  So I do the best thing that anyone could possibly do.  Go right downstairs to the bar.  I thought you were going to say gym. 
[00:14:30]  No, no, no.  I thought you were going to jump on a treadmill.  Go right downstairs to the bar and start drinking.  Because treadmill, you know, you can work off stress.  Yeah, Dr. Phil tells you.  You can work off stress.  To, you know, do one thing.  Yeah.  All right.  So I go right down to the bar.  So now I start texting the girlfriend, start texting and, and it's light text, you know,  it's very light texting.  She's playing trivial pursuit with her girlfriend, Jody.  And, uh, then I figured maybe, you know, it's time for a, a, a real phone call, you know, 
[00:15:00]  smooth things over.  So the text messaging is going well at this point.  Yeah.  It's very vague.  I'm not addressing the problem or anything.  So I call up the problem, which was no real problem.  No problem.  No problem.  That's just it.  This, this fight was the stupidest thing.  Stupid.  Like most of them that people get into.  Like I said, seven years, no, no fight.  This is the worst it's ever been. 
[00:15:30]  Even at this point.  So, uh, get on the phone and we're talking and she says something about, you know,  that I, I overreacted with the wine and me now I've had a few, I'm like, overreacted.  What?  I had wine all over about, and here we go again.  It was like the old honeymoon episode of, you know, the record.  Hi, your mother.  It's just, you know how she is.  She comes over. 
[00:16:00]  She's a blah, blah, blah.  You know, you try your good intentions and, you know, it just, it didn't work out.  So, um, I, I just went, okay, great, great.  But, well, you, you, you hear, you hear me?  You hear me on my phone?  You hear me on my phone?  Wham!  My cell phone.  I throw it against the wall.  Hence, no one being able to get in touch with me the past couple of days.  And hence, the, the pebble?  Did it go pebble?  No, I went to, uh, this Sanyo piece of crap that is going to get thrown at the wall also. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  But I needed a cell phone, hence the cell phone.  Uh, yeah, throw it against the wall.  See, a lot of things are starting to make sense.  Because on Monday, I knew you were out of sorts during the radio show.  But I thought you were just tired from the Cleveland thing.  I'm like, man, it's a little out of it today.  I'm not going to be, I'm not going to lie to you.  It was simmering.  And I'm like, he's, he's very, you were very quiet on Monday.  I don't know if a lot of people noticed that.  And you called me from, like, some satellite phone or from your actual car to tell me you didn't have a cell phone anymore. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm starting to think, why?  And I really thought to myself, he must have broke his cell phone.  Because I threw it against the wall.  Well, now I know that officially.  Yeah.  But at the time, I'm like, what do you mean, you know, you don't have a cell phone anymore?  Right against the wall.  All right, go ahead.  In a thousand pieces.  Right at the bar?  No, no, this was up in the hotel room.  Oh.  Up in the hotel room.  I wish I did in front of everybody.  So now I'm just livid.  So I decide I'm going downstairs.  And again, remember, I had been at the bar.  But I figure I'm going downstairs, getting another room, leaving a note in the room and saying, I'm in this room. 
[00:17:30]  Because now I know I got to get up for work the next day and I have to sleep.  I can't be arguing through the night.  You stay in this room.  I'll stay in this room.  Now, remember this.  We've never even been apart in seven years.  Slept together every night seven years.  So this now sets her off.  She is wicked pissed that I am in another room. 
[00:18:00]  And I decide to shut off my phone and give the front desk a do not disturb me at any cost kind of a thing unless there's a fire.  So now she's pissed at me.  So this whole thing is is just snowballing in stupidity.  It's a snowball of stupidity.  So, yeah, the pissed mist in the air, you know, that kind of argument, non speaking about it thing is going on all day Monday when I get home. 
[00:18:30]  Not resolved.  So Tuesday, still not resolved.  Wait, wait, wait, you fast forward way too much.  So then you got up for the show Monday.  You did the show.  Did the show Monday.  How did you guys all go back to the house?  Went back to the house.  Separately?  No, that's right.  She didn't stay in the room at the hotel.  She took a cab and went back home to Long Island instead of staying in the extra room at the hotel. 
[00:19:00]  So I stay at the hotel.  She stays home.  Okay.  So after the show, Monday, I drive home and there's, you know, that underlying you just know that's very uncomfortable.  And we're not used to this, you know, it's very, very odd.  Tuesday, come in, do the show.  So you guys don't talk.  I don't mean to slow you down.  But so on Monday, it's just that whole this, this, this, this, uh, this, uh, situation's been simmering. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Since, uh, Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  Yep.  Monday, you get home from the show.  Now you're walking around the house uncomfortably.  You guys aren't talking.  No, it's a lot, a lot of small talk like, uh, oh, got some mail.  Oh, that type of thing.  Okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  So you kind of avoided each other all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you went to bed probably early.  Uh, went to bed.  Yeah.  Okay.  Went to bed.  We went to sleep.  Because that would have been a great opportunity to finally talk it out.  Just talk it out. 
[00:20:00]  Because now you're back home.  Right.  Were you pissed off?  Were you just, were you like bummed out that it was like this or were you still kind of pissed off?  Bummed out.  Little pissed.  Just aggravated at the situation.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  It was just, it was just, you know, the, uh, the alignment of the stars were wrong.  And, uh, just never happened before.  So, um, oh, wow.  No, go ahead.  So, uh, Tuesday, coming to work now after this whole Monday thing. 
[00:20:30]  And, uh, do the show on Tuesday.  Back to normal Anthony, by the way.  On Tuesday.  Great show.  Was it?  Great show.  I don't remember much of it.  I was, uh, in a state.  So, uh, I, I drive home.  You got a good poker face, by the way.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You have a great poker face.  I, I knew something was wrong Monday, but I thought you were just tired.  Maybe a little hungover, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Tuesday, back to normal Anthony.  So, you have the best poker face ever.  You should be winning tournaments all over the freaking world. 
[00:21:00]  Thank you.  Sorry.  Go, I, do the show.  Go home.  Tuesday now.  Afternoon.  It's like, uh, 12, 15.  And, oh.  They're telling, they're telling us we have to break.  Jesus Christ.  I don't mean to do a radio tease, but they are telling me.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be. 
[00:21:30]  What are you doing?  I'm looking for someone to bounce.  There you go.  Because I don't like that guy right there.  There you go.  Enjoy the program.  Buy, uh, XM or tune into your local, uh, FM affiliate that we're on.  Boink.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Um, we got to take a break.  You're saying we got to take a break.  Well, it is a business.  It's safe to say that it got, don't let me forget where I've been, where I was. 
[00:22:00]  No, we're up to Tuesday.  Did the show.  And then you go home.  And then I go home.  And trust me, you do not want to touch that dial.  And this is where things get ridiculous.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  It's me saying we have to take a break.  Trust me.  I'm trying to control Anthony.  Anthony could go all the way to eight without a break.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's me saying we should take a break.  But trust me, it gets a lot better.  And the rage is about to start in about ten minutes. 
[00:22:30]  Because this is just a setup.  There's somebody telling me to stop bouncing.  Just bounced them.  How ironic.  All right, when we get back, Anthony, we'll, uh, talk about, uh, what happened when we got  home Tuesday and where it's at today.  Yeah.  Where we stand today.  Because it still continues.  It still continues.  It's not what you think, based on what I've told you.  I understand.  This takes a twist like, you know, the Simpsons starts out with something. 
[00:23:00]  And then, like, about ten minutes into a Simpsons episode, the beginning part has nothing to  do with what the rest of the Simpsons episode is about.  Yeah.  That's what happened here.  Do not touch your dial.  All right.  Anthony, uh...  Don't even, don't even give away anything.  No, I'm not.  But I think you're going to walk off the show today.  I might have to take some, like, uh, uh, breaks, uh, for phone calls and things like 
[00:23:30]  that.  And, uh, uh, at about eight or so.  Eight-ish.  Okay.  It's the ONA virus.  And the pest might have to get involved.  Really?  I don't know.  All right.  The second part of the story, which is, uh, much better than the first part.  I gotta be honest with you.  Oh, the first part sucked?  No, I mean...  Thanks.  The first part...  Telling a f***ing story over here.  About my f***ing life.  Yeah.  I thought it was good.  This isn't a cute little radio story.  It's called a prelude.  It's a prelude.  Sorry if you start with a goddamn, uh, uh, chase scene. 
[00:24:00]  Jesus Christ.  Well, the chase scene is coming up, uh, as well as, uh, all sorts of explosions.  Oh.  All right.  We'll, uh, we'll step aside.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  And that's what happened. 
[00:24:30]  That's unbelievable.  That is unbelievable.  I'm, uh, I'm kidding, of course.  I knew it was going to involve a shwoogie.  I just knew it.  Dude, you're not IMing me.  Someone isn't actually IMing me.  Oh.  Bye.  Bye.  Will you just turn off the pal talk for now?  I can't help it.  I can't help it.  Was it an important IM though, maybe?  Did he ask anything important?  Yeah, he said hi.  What a douchebag.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got a very agitated Anthony in studio.  He's in the middle of telling a story.  Um, just to recap really fast. 
[00:25:00]  Cleveland strip.  Started Sunday.  Yeah, go ahead.  Really fast.  Stupid argument over spilled wine on the plane with my girlfriend.  I've never, uh, we, we've never had an argument in the seven years we've been together and  lived together.  We don't have arguments.  We, we, we, we just don't.  Uh, and, uh, this is, uh, it kind of started snowballing, got way blown out of proportion,  continued.  Every little thing was like pissing me off.  And, and, uh, uh, the fact that the, uh, initial argument wasn't being addressed as the day 
[00:25:30]  went by on, uh, Monday.  Quiet ride all the way back to Manhattan.  Yeah.  The quiet ride.  Because you still couldn't get back to your house on Long Island.  Uh, she went off to go, uh, to a movie with her friend.  You went up to your room.  You went to the Apple store, couldn't get what you wanted.  So you decided to drink.  You text her.  That was kind of going well.  Then you called her.  That wasn't going well.  So you smashed your cell phone in your room and then you got another room.  She got pissed off because you guys have never, uh, slept, uh, never been apart in seven  years.  So when she came back to a room where you weren't at anymore, cause you were in another 
[00:26:00]  room, she said, screw this.  She took a cab home.  Yeah.  You finally went home after Monday show.  Right.  Uh, it was never addressed.  It was like a weirdness around your house all day.  It was very uncomfortable.  Small talk, blah, blah, blah.  You went to sleep early to go to the show on Tuesday, which was a great radio show.  I gotta tell you.  I got to tell you.  Did the show on Tuesday.  And then now we're up to you leaving the show on Tuesday and going home.  I go home on Tuesday and, uh, for the first time ever, I get home and she's lit. 
[00:26:30]  She's tanked.  She, uh, uh, took the, uh, nice bottle of absolute out of the freezer, did about five  shots and, uh, was, uh, just laying out on the, um, uh, patio.  Uh, uh, like lounge chair with a book on the, uh, side of the, on the, on the table, but  like passed out.  So I'm like, uh, baby.  Hey, baby.  And she's like, uh, like, oh boy. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  Come here.  Get up.  So I like, pick her up, bring her in the house.  And she's, uh, obviously, um, not, not rational in her talking.  She's, you know, telling me that, uh, you know, I don't care and things like that.  And, you know, things that people say when, when they're hammered, she was hammered.  She was, you know, we got in an argument, never, never been in an argument like this. 
[00:27:30]  I dealt with it Sunday by slamming down drinks at the bar.  She dealt with it Tuesday by slamming down drinks, uh, at home.  And, uh, so I bring her into the bathroom eventually, uh, cause she's feeling sick at  that point, which is normal.  Uh, she's talking a little better, but really still kind of, uh, and I could see, I see the  bottle of vodka there.  There's barely anything taken.  It was brand new bottle.  So there's barely anything out of it. 
[00:28:00]  So, uh, I'm waiting for her to throw up, get this over with.  And, uh, Nassau County police car comes to the front of the house.  So I'm like, that's odd.  You know, what did someone call the cops?  Or something, or, you know, how, how does anybody know anything's going on?  No, it's just a pal.  It's a Nassau County cop pal coming to drop off, uh, some Nassau County stickers for my 
[00:28:30]  car, the back window and, uh, PBA cards and things like that.  And don't forget the police uniform.  The uniform, the red light, everything I need.  So I can do 120 miles an hour with the cop car is on order.  You should have that soon.  Exactly.  Okay.  Just there as a, you know, friend.  So he throws out some kind of Ramon joke and notices my reaction probably isn't as he  thought it would be because I'm dealing with a situation inside.  Uh, so I, I say to the cop, I'm like, uh, I go, uh, do you want to take a look at my  girlfriend?  Just make sure everything's cool. 
[00:29:00]  You know, and I said, she's talking.  So it's not like, you know, she's, uh, uh, passed out or, you know, Oh, Oh, uh, not OD and  have alcohol poisoning or anything like that.  So he comes in and, you know, talks to her.  Hey, how you doing?  Uh, you know, that kind of thing.  And, uh, he goes, he goes, I got a, uh, EMT friend who's out there.  We, you know, just drive her down to, uh, as of right now, an unnamed hospital, just 
[00:29:30]  have her vitals checked.  You know, I'm like, okay, sounds good.  We do that.  Sounds like the smart thing to do, right?  Why not?  I'm figuring, you know, best be just safe like that.  Me, I'm Mr. Hypochondriac kind of guy.  And I know as long as you're talking and moving around, everything's fine.  It's the people that are like sprawled out and can't, and believe me, I lived with that  for nine years and, and she never does this, never does this. 
[00:30:00]  So this was so out of the blue that I was like, yeah, okay, let's do this.  So we end up in the, uh, emergency room and, uh, they don't give her anything because I  guess they deemed her fine.  Um, it was recorded, you know, like if you're, if you're ODing on something or you're, you're  the charcoal or whatever, or you're alcohol poisoning, they pump your stomach, they do  something.  I think they throw some kind of charcoal thing in you to make you vomit. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  Uncontrollably to get everything out.  Whatever.  So we don't do any of this.  No, we're just kind of sitting in a room and, uh, it's reported as, uh, an alcohol,  uh, um, just as an alcohol event, something like that.  The cop writes it down as, so we're sitting in this room and she's, you know, starting  to sober up and just getting hungry and, and thirsty.  So they get a water and food and stuff like that. 
[00:31:00]  And, uh, I'm just waiting, you know, to leave.  Her vitals are fine.  Waiting to leave.  All of a sudden, um, uh, the shrink walks in, the shrink comes in and starts talking to  her.  And, and after now the, the shrink talks to her while she's still hammered.  What time is this?  By the way, this is probably two 30.  So you got home in the afternoon, you got home around noon.  Yeah.  So it's a couple hours later.  Yeah.  Dealing with it at the house. 
[00:31:30]  Okay.  Two 30 at the hospital.  The shrink starts talking to her and, uh, she's hammered.  So the shrink is talking to her and decides because she's hammered that she needs to be  admitted, involuntarily admitted to the hospital.  And now we're waiting 10 hours, 10 hours before anything happens in this little elevator sized  room. 
[00:32:00]  And by this point now she's fine hungover, but we're just both like, you know, let's get  out of here.  This is ridiculous.  She's like, I tell her everything that happened, you know, throughout the course of when she  was hammered and, uh, everything's like, we're ready to go, ready to just go home.  Forget about the argument.  I said, you know, the argument was the stupidest frigging thing.  I know it was ridiculous.  Uh, let's go home.  Uh, the, the shrink comes in and goes, uh, well, you know, she, she should talk to somebody 
[00:32:30]  or you could do like an inpatient thing we have here.  We go, no, she goes, well, I'll give you a chance to think about it and walks out of  the room.  So we look at each other and start laughing and go, let's get out of here.  Let's just get the hell out of here.  She comes back hours later, this shrink and goes, um, yes.  Well, uh, uh, I spoke with some associates and we're, um, involuntarily admitting you.  Oh, really?  Okay. 
[00:33:00]  What do I got to sign?  So that stops.  Uh, where do I sign?  Where's the waiver?  The, uh, whatever it is, the, um, thing to, no, there is no thing.  I said, uh, so what happens?  Well, we take her upstairs and you go home and we hold her here for what?  Well, uh, she was drunk and I asked her if she was depressed and she said, uh, who doesn't  get depressed, uh, at some point in their life while she's hammered. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, and, and later she told me, I don't even remember talking to this woman.  Doesn't even remember talking to her cause she, uh, uh, hammered.  So they take her upstairs and, uh, they're like, all right, well, you could look around  to me.  You could look around and, and we're both kind of in shock going, what are you, you're  kidding me, right?  There, there's the shuffling lunatics, the drooling lunatics. 
[00:34:00]  Walking around the floor.  Doing the slipper walk.  Doing the slipper walk.  Now my girlfriend's hysterical crying saying, I cannot stay here.  I'm petrified.  You know, this is unbelievably ridiculous.  This sounds, this is illegal.  This shouldn't happen.  And I'm like powerless to do anything.  It's now after midnight.  It's now after midnight.  So I can't even go home and get stuff for her to make it more comfortable or whatever. 
[00:34:30]  Anyway, I assume why get stuff?  Obviously I'll come there tomorrow, uh, which was, um, what yesterday, I guess, or the day  before yesterday.  I'm not even sure days running into days.  Uh, it's the next day to be out of there.  It turns out I can't get in touch with any of these scumbag doctors to get her signed out.  They're unfindable.  You call them.  They're supposed to call you back. 
[00:35:00]  They don't call you back.  You find like three levels down of doctors just to sign her out.  She's fine.  She's fine.  There's no problem.  She's spoken with people.  I've spoken with the people there, the, you know, the, the, the shrinks that are there.  Everything's fine.  She can go.  She needs somebody to sign her out.  Where they're playing, they're playing golf or something.  So she's still in there, still in there.  It's now right now. 
[00:35:30]  It's Thursday because no jerk off, uh, it can be found to sign her out.  And these silverback gorillas that work there have no clue or care.  It's all cookie cutter because everybody's running around going, I want to go.  I'm fine.  Let me go.  They don't look at any, any individual situations or circumstance.  It's all the same.  Uh, so now you got a girl who is fine that can't leave because some idiot isn't there to sign a piece of paper. 
[00:36:00]  Let me ask you, and everybody's probably saying the same thing.  I'm thinking like, why don't I just say F you and walk out?  Like what's stopping you?  They will arrest you.  They will arrest you.  It's an arrestable offense.  Where did this come from?  First of all, no one told me this when, when, when the choice was given, which we weren't taking the option of staying anyway.  But when this, this, this manipulative little shrink bitch C word said, yeah, well, you could, you know, go and do this or, or we'll check you in. 
[00:36:30]  I'll be back in a little bit.  And as she is filling out the paperwork doesn't, it's a bunch of liars.  They don't, uh, they're not honest.  They don't look at any individual.  It's a group of people that they want to keep, um, uh, anesthetized. 
[00:37:00]  So I, I walk in there the first visit that I get, which in this place is ridiculous.  Like for an hour long at one o'clock, you get like an hour from 12 to one in the afternoon.  There's no phone contact.  There's no nothing.  She's losing her mind.  So am I.  Yeah.  So I walk in, she's having lunch.  Of course, she just freaks out, insane upset.  And she goes, they, they just, you know, they gave, they gave me something, uh, and I can barely stay awake. 
[00:37:30]  So the doctor comes over and sits down and I am, I cursing at the doctor.  I go, how the, are you supposed to get a legitimate assessment of this girl's, uh, psychological state when you've given her something that has her falling asleep in her lunch?  I go, how the, how are you supposed to now assess this and find out that she's a rational, smart, funny, witty, uh, uh, girl instead of one of these people you have that you pump with drugs. 
[00:38:00]  Cause that's all you do here.  You incompetence.  They're nothing but incompetence.  So I'm just, I'm cursing this woman out.  And she finally, uh, says, well, we won't give her any more of that.  I go, yeah, don't.  And I told her, I told my girlfriend, I go, if, if they give you anything, spit it out.  I go, do not swallow anything.  They give you a pill, hold it in your cheek and then get rid of it.  Get rid of it.  This is like cuckoo's nest. 
[00:38:30]  Exactly.  So I'm sitting there going, now, where's the doctor that signs her out?  Uh, he's not here.  Where is he?  He's not here.  I want to talk to him.  Have him call me.  Here's the number.  So now visiting hours are over again.  She loses it.  I tell her, you know, be strong.  I'm going to get you out of here.  I'm going to get you out of here.  Have to drive home.  Uh, and I'm waiting for this call from this doctor.  Never, never calls me.  Doesn't call me. 
[00:39:00]  So now I go for the second visit, which is 630 to eight.  Um, go in there, immediately ask where the guy is, where the doctor is.  And the smug ass behind the counter goes, uh, excuse me, sir.  It's 630.  He's at home or, or he's not available.  I go, oh, he wasn't available when I was here earlier.  He wasn't available when he was promised, when I was promised a phone call from him to sign out my girlfriend.  I go, what if there was the biggest emergency ever and you had to get in touch with him? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, we'd page him.  Do it.  Well, we can't.  We have to go through his underling.  It's more bull, more lies, more garbage.  So we're walking around there and it's kind of at this point now becoming funny.  Like we're both sitting on the couch, uh, kind of like, you know, curled up and laughing at how, how ridiculous this is.  There are screaming people.  There's the shuffling people.  There's collages made of crepe paper and construction paper on the wall that they make them make. 
[00:40:00]  And she's sitting there going.  Did you take advantage of the situation and talk to some of the other people on the floor?  Cause you'll get some great stories.  Don't know.  I can't.  I think people know my mom's been out of these joints my whole life.  And I, I, I would visit her from time to time and you know, you're in this room and all  of a sudden there's a guy that he's making something out of macaroni, a little art project.  And he's like, I got a business trip to Toledo.  I got to, I got to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be in Toledo Friday.  Just out of their minds. 
[00:40:30]  So when, when, when I was dropping her off, I, uh, the first night when she's completely upset,  we go upstairs and, uh, walk into the place, the unit.  And there's this, uh, uh, I guess security guy there and he goes, don't worry.  Everything's going to be fine.  She'll be taken care of.  I go, don't give me the line.  Don't give me the line.  She doesn't even belong here.  And I know they hear that from everybody.  So that's, you know, the category that they fall into.  Um, so as we're walking to the door, she's completely upset and I turned to the guy and 
[00:41:00]  I say, if, if anything adverse happens to her, I'll kill everyone on this floor.  And he, he, he turns around and goes, you cannot say that.  He goes, you honestly, you cannot say that.  And I just smiled and I said, say what, what did I say?  He goes, you know what you said?  I go, no.  What did I say?  And I just smiled at him and, and walked out.  He was petrified. 
[00:41:30]  You know, you're going to be switching places with your girl.  You know that, right?  Petrified.  Maybe you're scared because you're checking someone into a psychiatric unit and you're  threatening to kill everyone on the floor.  Exactly.  Definitely do it.  Yeah.  I told Anthony before the show, I'm like, they're going to let her go probably today.  And as you're all happy, getting ready to hold her hand, like three animals are going  to tackle, tackle you and, and, you know, pull you down and, and throw a straight jacket.  Well, on last night's visit, we're sitting on the couch and she's got like her legs over  my legs and I got like my arms around her and stuff. 
[00:42:00]  We're just talking.  You're comforting her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're talking and kind of laughing about how ridiculous this whole situation has turned,  snowballed into.  Like we went from the beginning of wine spilling on a plane and how it snowballed into what  it is, into this.  She was upset that we had an argument and that's what happens.  If every, if every time a person that was upset about an argument had a, a, a, and got 
[00:42:30]  hammered, uh, we'd all be in insane asylums if this was how it's supposed to be treated.  So we're laughing about how it got, you know, snowballed and this, this ape comes up and  goes, no touching, no touching.  We both give her the big F you just as loud as day.  Just go F you.  She goes, I'll take away your, um, your, your visiting, uh, privileges.  So do it.  She's out of here tomorrow anyway.  And later I see her in, in the nurse's station eating a banana with one hand. 
[00:43:00]  And I go, I go, I go to her, you know how many germs are on the keyboard and mouse you're  using right now?  And she goes, that's why I'm eating it with this hand and working with this hand.  I go, boy, you must really tear through your work that way.  So they are, they just are livid at me at this point because I'm livid pissed at them  and I'm trying to get answers.  So now I found one guy that would actually talk to me like a human being and got names, 
[00:43:30]  uh, uh, and numbers for these various doctors that at eight Oh five said eight o'clock, but  give them a couple of minutes.  I'll give you five.  The calls start eight Oh five.  If I don't get a response that she is being signed out of there today by nine test alert,  pest alert, I'll give out the numbers, the hospital.  You shut the place down.  I shut it down.  I say you get a pest army together. 
[00:44:00]  Mm hmm.  What about a sink?  Can you throw that through a window somewhere?  I know fountain, big fountain.  I go with sink cause you're a little smaller.  I am going to be able to get that fountain out of the ground.  I am though.  I think you can get it done.  I think you can get it done.  Livid.  And that's where we are as of today.  That's really, uh, as you're talking, I'm just clenching my teeth.  I was getting at the medical profession is it's all, it's just anonymous. 
[00:44:30]  It got worse and worse.  Yeah.  No one cares.  No one wants to hear anything different than they think they know.  It's just that sign her out.  It's done.  So now we wait.  So where did it all go wrong?  Don't know.  It was a snowball thing.  Yeah, no, I know.  It all went wrong where, I don't know, should have gotten up and left.  No, no, I mean like at the hospital.  That's just, I mean, it just sounds crazy.  It is crazy.  That they could do this. 
[00:45:00]  It is crazy.  There's no reason, no way this should be legal.  That they could just do this without any consent, any, anything.  Just make this decision.  Based on, uh, you know, an interview with a drunk girl.  Are they even supposed to do that?  No.  Because if you're a cop, I think like a lot of the information you get from somebody, if  they're completely intoxicated, it's probably.  You know what?  I actually made an analogy.  I said, I go, that's like taking the dashboard cam of a cop during a drunk driving arrest. 
[00:45:30]  And when the guy is completely sober saying, you can't drive, look at the tape of you.  Look at the way you're staggering.  No, but that was when I was drunk.  I, I was arrested and no, you can't drive.  A lot of people are saying it's illegal for a shrink to talk to her when she's drunk.  Probably is.  They got to wait for her to sober up.  I don't know my rights.  And then you, uh.  Her rights.  Then you assess the situation.  Yup.  A cop in Jersey, you're supposed to wait until they sober up to talk to them.  She told her, she said, I have no recollection of a conversation with you. 
[00:46:00]  That's how hammered I was.  You should, uh, I would definitely have a nice lawyer looking at.  Oh, believe me, it's already in the works.  Oh, this place is getting su-hoo-hoo-hoo-ed.  Sued.  Heads will roll.  If you didn't have, like, be in the position you are where you know the people you know  and you can at least get answered a little bit faster, most people have to deal with  these scumbags and, uh, they're completely at their mercy.  Dude, I'm not getting any, believe me, I wish, I wish I could go in there and go, hey, 
[00:46:30]  I got a radio show.  Could you sign her out?  It, that means nothing here.  This is not helping me at all.  All of my relationships with certain police officers and everything, not helping.  This, I am, I, I'm in a situation.  I can do nothing about.  So she's out today?  I sure hope so.  She better be, because from what I heard, uh, she has to talk to, um, one person and,  uh, then can get out. 
[00:47:00]  And now, where is that one person?  Well, we'll find out at 8.05, because that's when I'm supposed to call.  And her sister, uh, in Colorado is also, because I got, I talked, I called her and she's going  to call.  And we're both going to call and call and call and call.  And if I get no, no response by nine o'clock, maybe the pestle call, uh, certain numbers  will slowly leak out things and information.  At 8.05?  No, I got to start calling at 8.05. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Can't tie up the phone lines.  No, that's what I mean.  At 8.05?  Yeah.  You're doing like radio teases.  Trust me.  It ain't a tease, believe me.  We don't have to tease this show today.  I'm not teasing this.  Uh, Ryan in Chicago.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony, are you going to bring the bill in to the, uh, on the air when they give it  to you?  Uh, yeah, the bill.  No, that's another thing is what this is.  Uh, this is a way for them to get money, insurance money.  If, if, if we left that night, there's no more money. 
[00:48:00]  If, if they check her in, oh, this doctor, this doctor, they could all take a little  bite of the insurance policy, you know, the, uh, medical insurance money.  They could all take a little piece.  That's what it's all about.  It's about keeping you there, giving you as much as you can, uh, uh, get as many doctors  as you, as can dip into the till.  And that's, uh, that's what's going on.  Why would they medicate a person though?  Who's not yelling or violent or crazy? 
[00:48:30]  Exactly.  I said, why is she medicating?  She goes, well, she was upset last night and had a hard time sleeping.  I go, I, and even to that, I said, all right, it's two o'clock in the afternoon.  Why did you medicate her again?  I go, and you're supposed to now have an interview with her like this.  Of course you're going to think she's a nut.  She can't even stay awake.  Motherf-  Just say it.  He'll get it down the hall.  John and Yonkers, what's up? 
[00:49:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm a little confused.  If she didn't say anything like she's going to kill herself or she's not a danger to herself,  I don't understand why they would hold her.  Because that's the way I think the, uh, psychiatrist interpreted it as she was talking to a drunk  girl.  That's why Ann's losing his mind.  She's boxed.  I mean, so what?  Everybody gets boxed.  There's no reason to detain her.  You should have just got up and walked out of there.  I think when she said depressed, yeah, sometimes, who doesn't? 
[00:49:30]  You know, something like that, uh, while being drunk, uh, all, all of a sudden, oh, well,  now, now this, you know, aspiring frigging, uh, psychiatrist, uh, is going to, you know,  make her bones.  Oh, that's ridiculous, man.  Yeah, she's probably, she's a rookie, uh, psychologist, has no idea what she's talking  about.  So, and, uh, I don't know why they would keep her.  I mean, she got boxed.  It's, it's not a big deal.  And then, you know, talk, talk, talk to her when she's sober.  Yeah.  I mean, they're medicating.  That's how she's supposed to get sober to talk to if they keep throwing stuff down 
[00:50:00]  her throat.  What does that mean, get boxed?  I mean, what does that mean, get boxed?  Hammered.  Get hammered.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's getting hammered.  Damn.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, Ope, I had a question for you.  Do you guys have any of those little microphones you can stick on the straitjacket they're  going to put around Anthony when he goes there?  I got to be honest with you.  Anthony's a lot calmer on the show than he was in the office when I first ran into him  this morning.  I'm surprised he didn't rip a few heads, Dan. 
[00:50:30]  That's freaking crazy.  I'm amazed that he was able to tell the story without just completely losing his mind,  because in the office, it was...  I am so close to it.  He had a lot of people just kind of looking down and reading newspapers.  Yeah.  I can believe there was something interesting on the computer screen.  You can't even imagine how pissed I am.  A lot of people saying you got to sue Lori on Long Island.  Lori.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Oh, well.  Anthony, here's what you need to do.  Walk into the hospital and just say, on the advice of my attorney, I am signing her out 
[00:51:00]  against medical advice.  Give me the form now.  That's what it's called.  Yeah, I know.  You can't do that.  You're not necessarily allowed to do this.  Yeah.  Trust me.  I'm in this field.  They're not allowed to do this.  Well, if there was a way, I would have done it.  I looked into every possible way.  Talked to every person.  There's no way to do this.  Well, in this country, they're not allowed to do that.  That's against the law.  Yeah, well...  Well, if they won't give you the form, just get up and walk out with her. 
[00:51:30]  If they call the police, the police can't hold her there.  She didn't commit a crime.  Well, let me ask you.  They said they'll arrest you.  Is there actually a guard at the door?  Like, if you're both just headed towards the exit and says, I'll get the car.  Yeah, there's probably some security guy.  But, you know, the thing I read was that, you know, there would be sheriffs or police officers involved to bring you back.  Which, you know, where did that come from?  Did I hear of that?  It really is amazing.  Frank at Oceanside. 
[00:52:00]  Frank?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Listen, the idea that she's going to get out of there any time before 12 o'clock is an impossibility.  You've got to keep her in there for another day.  Another day of fees, another day of tests and everything.  Nah, that ain't happening, my friend.  Wow.  Because I will just go in and take her out and face the consequences.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You know what the other consequences are, too?  Afterwards, now she has this psychiatric incident.  Yeah.  Now it affects you down the road, too.  Yeah, well, we'll see. 
[00:52:30]  Good luck.  Yeah, thanks.  All right, let's go to Debbie in Massachusetts.  Debbie.  Hi.  How does it affect you down the road?  What's he talking about?  I have no idea.  Debbie.  Yeah, hi.  Hello.  Hi.  By the way, can I bring up something?  It's a huge story today.  Terrell Owens.  Yeah.  Terrell Owens, you know, I don't believe he tried to commit suicide.  That's so stupid.  Yeah, but it's not even funny.  If you're loading yourself up with pills and you're unresponsive.  It's so obvious.  He took a couple of painkillers because of injuries or whatever, and then he was a little 
[00:53:00]  dopey and out of it, and then he was taking his normal supplements and mixed it up with  more pain pills.  Yeah.  Terrell Owens is not trying to kill himself, but ESPN and everyone else is all over the  story.  Like, oh, he's not, look, he's denying that he tried to kill himself.  The guy did not try to kill himself.  He made a really bad mistake.  But he should be locked up in a hospital.  But that's the point I'm making.  Terrell Owens in and out of the hospital, and he was on a lot of painkillers. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, that's a guy that should be maybe having a talking to.  Right.  Not a girl who has a fight with a boyfriend gets hammered.  That's what I'm saying.  It's so weird that this story hit the same day as your story.  Because, I mean, this guy was in and out of the hospital like that.  Yeah.  There was no suicidal tendencies or anything.  It wasn't a part of the story.  All right.  We've got a couple more.  Jerk-offs.  And then we'll continue after the break. 
[00:54:00]  Carl in Baltimore.  What's up?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  Same thing happened to my wife a couple of years ago, basically.  She had a couple of drinks down and passed out on the front porch.  Neighbor called the police.  Had to go to the hospital to find her.  And the next thing I know, they've got to keep her in there for 72 hours.  Yeah, that's what they say.  Like, they have the right to hold somebody for 72 hours based on their evaluation.  Right.  Of a drunk person.  Yeah, it's up. 
[00:54:30]  Thanks, man.  All right.  Scum there.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Later today, we'll be watching Chopper coverage of a red Shelby and a high-speed chase.  That's right.  Oh, try to catch me.  Down the LIE on Channel 12.  That'll be the car I take.  And then a lot of people want to know which, um...  No, I won't say...  No, I better not say it.  What?  The hospital?  No, you're on edge.  Give me permission to just read one and some feedback.  If you're going to piss me off, I swear I'll just fucking leave.  All right.  What you ought to do, if you get her out of there and you're worried about getting arrested, 
[00:55:00]  just check into a hotel until you get it all worked out.  That's why they can't go to your house and get you.  Thanks, Jim.  Maybe they'll just go to the hotel.  Maybe I'll just check in where I always...  No.  They go to another hotel.  So you want me to be on the lam?  All right, yeah, I guess...  Yeah, I don't...  Helen.  Right.  Well, you have to come in and talk in a different voice.  It's the Opie and Fan Show.  Yeah.  Wink, wink.  It's kind of hard for a radio guy to be on the lam and on the air.  Also, we just change your voice with all those machines.  Show I work. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  That really is good advice.  Check her out.  Just, the cops will never find you.  What a dope.  I, you know, today...  With a phony wig and a mustache and sunglasses comes in to the show every day with voice technology to change up the old voice.  Yeah.  Today's a very pivotal day.  Because if she does not get out today, there could be problems that I might be off for a while.  Can I ask you something?  Now, this really does suck.  And if it sounds like they're going to keep her for 72 hours, why wouldn't you, like, hang in there, make sure she hangs in there, get her out after 72 hours, and then all hell breaks loose after you get her out of there. 
[00:56:00]  Because...  With lawyers and all that crap.  She doesn't belong in there for 72 hours.  She doesn't belong in there for a minute.  So you're making a stand and a point here.  This is...  Yeah, this is...  This is...  We enjoy each other's company, and I...  Can't kidnap you for three days?  It's depressing me to be in my friggin' bed alone at night, knowing that she's in that crap hole. 
[00:56:30]  I understand all that, but it seems like if you do something crazy today, you'll make this situation even a lot worse.  I'm just asking.  Gets her out.  I'm just asking.  Why not, you know, deal with it?  It sucks.  Sucks you know what.  And then all hell breaks loose after you get her out of there.  I'm trying every legal means possible to get her out.  If that doesn't work...  Right.  And I'm making the limit today.  Go ahead.  All right.  Go ahead.  When's the 72 hours up?  You shouldn't wait, by the way.  I don't even know.  Why should they be allowed to just kidnap you against your will? 
[00:57:00]  Midnight on Tuesday, they admitted her.  Also late Friday, I guess.  Early Wednesday.  Late Friday.  No.  It's on midnight.  Midnight Tuesday is early Wednesday, right?  Midnight Tuesday is late Tuesday, so it'll be late Friday.  It's three days.  So it'll be late Friday, which would mean tonight and then...  No.  Okay.  There's not going to be another night of me sitting in my bed like a frigging idiot being 
[00:57:30]  depressed and her in that nuthouse being depressed.  They are, yeah, they're holding her against her will and against her health.  There's no way a healthy-minded person should be in that situation.  It is depressing and you get like creeped out.  Right.  There's legitimate crazy people in there. 
[00:58:00]  You don't have to tell me.  I've seen it many, many times.  Oh.  That's enough to make you go nuts.  A lot of people are saying, Mike from West Palm, how does T.O. get out in a few hours  and Axe Girl has to spend days?  Yeah.  Days.  Let's go to Ryan in Smithtown.  Ryan.  Smithtown?  What?  Yeah, what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen, the reason they can keep her in there is if they have two different medical doctors  to each fill out a form called a 2PC.  I work in a business.  Yeah.  Now, if she was not evaluated by two different doctors, and trust me, this happens on a daily 
[00:58:30]  basis, one doctor will see her, write the 2PC, walk up to another doctor, have them duplicate  it.  They can keep her against the will.  They'll do this for at least five days because five days is when they get the maximum amount  of money from the insurance company.  After five days, the money drops off, it's in the hospital.  They can only do it for 72 hours, though.  But, well, yeah, well, they'll try to do it for five days.  Well, whatever they try, she wasn't spoken to by two people, either.  She wasn't?  She was drunk.  One girl talked to her. 
[00:59:00]  You know what?  I'm telling you, you have to follow this strategically because if she wasn't interviewed by two different  people face-to-face, then there's no way they can keep her there.  Yeah.  Well, she wasn't.  I work in one of the establishments.  I see it all the time.  She wasn't, and she was drunk at the time of the interview.  It's ridiculous.  So, uh, lawsuit, forget about it.  Yeah, apparently she took some, you know, notes, this wannabe shrink, took some scratchings 
[00:59:30]  when she was drunk, and then, what, goes up to another doctor and goes, hey, here's what  I wrote down.  Oh, I concur.  Instead of coming in and talking also and getting a real second opinion, you take a few paragraphs  written on a piece of paper from a drunk girl.  That's great.  That's great medical attention.  It's illegal.  They have to see her face-to-face.  They sign their license away.  Those forms are on file. 
[01:00:00]  You will definitely have a...  Oh, believe me.  The whole thing.  Yeah, and then last night I go, I go, I want, I want her records.  I want, I want to know exactly what the two doctors said to her and what she said, um,  yesterday.  I go, just give me all her records.  She's giving me permission.  Oh, we can't release records while she's still in the hospital.  Really?  Why can't they?  Is that the truth?  I've never heard of that one either.  You have the right to your records, and she has the right to her records.  It's just this big machine that you can't do anything about. 
[01:00:30]  You're trapped in it.  You can't, you have, you're powerless, no matter what the hell, unless maybe you're,  you know, Tyrell, but you're powerless to do anything.  So I go up for visiting, I bring her stuff, I have to watch other people sit there with,  with, with catatonic people, as we're sitting there going, holy Jesus Christ, this monkey's 
[01:01:00]  telling me I can't touch you.  That would have drove me nuts.  It did.  Oh, it did.  Good touch.  You're going to tell me I can't touch my girl?  Are you nuts?  Yeah.  Go screw.  All right, we got to take a break.  Bastards.  Oh.  Oops.  It's a nightmare.  Completely.  Completely.  I'm just going to curse, sorry.  And she gets out of there today.  No matter what.  No matter what.  That's it.  All right, we'll step aside for a bit. 
[01:01:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  All right, we're back.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Knorton.  A lot of people want to help you, Ant.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Want to take a couple more calls and then we'll try to move on?  Yeah, it's when you get 800 bits of advice that none of them jive with each other.  I love that when people give, like, bad legal advice.  Yeah.  Like, dude, the way you got to do it is tell them you want to form and on the way out say legal counsel and they can't arrest.  Really?  They can't?  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Ed.  Why don't you just bring your water with you today so you stay out of trouble?  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I got one of those.  Yeah, just bring him in with you and check her out, man.  Peace out, guys.  When I say it's easy as that.  Bring a lawyer.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I got a better idea.  Just take Kenny and Poe up there and you can just walk right out of the place.  I don't think you'd have much of a problem there.  There you go.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  And the way you use Kenny and Poe is they talk to the doctors and nurses and then when they doze off, you just walk her right out. 
[01:03:00]  How quick would he be committed?  Kenny?  I needed that laugh, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Your hair is a fire risk.  Club sort of Kenny is your chief.  Yeah.  He's your chief.  Just as smart as chief was.  Someone saying have Travis dress in a dress and have him switch places.  Like in Cuckoo's Nest when he had Candy and the other girl come in, you could have Travis and the other young lady sneak in through the window. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Linda in Massachusetts.  Linda?  Anthony?  Yes.  Anthony?  Hi.  I'm a psychiatric nurse.  I've been one for 30 years.  I have one piece of advice for you.  Please do not go in there and act like a lunatic because I promise you they'll let her go and they'll commit you.  That's what will happen.  Commit me.  Yep.  Not commit me.  Are they going to commit him?  How would I act like a lunatic where they would commit me, ma'am?  Please wear something from your home collection. 
[01:04:00]  I would.  Can you show up?  Oh, I would.  A little helmet.  Anthony, you go crazy.  You start yelling.  You start screaming.  They will.  They don't yell and scream.  I'm very logical when I talk to these people.  I'm good.  I'm like Spock.  Good.  Good.  Because, you know, they can hold her for 72 hours.  First of all...  Yeah, I've heard that.  Believe me.  They were wrong to begin with.  No psychiatric unit should have admitted her until she'd been medically cleared. 
[01:04:30]  Medically cleared means she is no longer drunk.  Yeah, exactly.  Then she gets evaluated, okay?  And then if she's clear, she goes home.  If she talks about being depressed, if she talks about any of that, then they can hold her for 72.  The good news is they don't have to hold her for 72.  Yeah.  Why did you say 72 instead of 72 hours?  Well, 72 hours, 72.  72.  That was a medical term of...  All right, go ahead.  You hugged the whole area.  I didn't mean to chime in and try to be a part of.  Go ahead.  Right away. 
[01:05:00]  It's about you.  72.  Sorry.  I didn't realize it.  And, you know, Opie was right.  You know, the thing is, go in, be rational, be reasonable, get out, and wreak havoc.  I said that.  Yep.  You did.  All right.  That's exactly what I've been doing.  Yeah.  And that's why she's still in there, because I've been rational.  No, trust me.  Really.  Really.  Once she's out of there, unleash hell.  But in the meantime, just be cool.  And she'll walk out the door.  All right, ladies.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steve in Yonkers. 
[01:05:30]  Steve.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  A little thing happened to me, and, like, I wouldn't...  I walked out of the emergency room, because some doctor wanted to admit me for a lung condition,  and I didn't want to stay, and it wasn't a major thing.  I get home, and the place I live is owned by my parents, right?  The cops come flying through my door, saying that the doctor called, saying I was acting crazy.  So they take me to the hospital, put me in the psych ward, right?  And I'm asking people, why am I here?  Why am I here? 
[01:06:00]  Before the psychologist interviewed me, they shoot me up with a cocktail of a muscle relaxer and adrenaline.  Now, I can't even hold my head up, right?  So they examine me, they leave me in there, and I'm asking people, why am I here?  Not acting violent, there was nothing wrong.  I said, I just left the emergency room.  I didn't want to be admitted.  Could you go down the hall and tell my girlfriend, I'll talk to her later?  Because you sound exactly like some of the lunatics that were shuffling along in their slippers, sir.  Your story is going on and on. 
[01:06:30]  The slippers shuffle.  Well, the nurse told me, and they could get out.  Your phone call should be committed for 72.  All right, Steve means well.  Thanks, Steve and Yonkers.  There's a fancy man, Frunkus.  Frunkus.  From FBA.com.  You know, dude.  Dude, I know a lawyer.  He's giving you Bob Kelly advice.  Dude, you can just walk in, get or leave.  That's the law, dude.  Dude.  That's why they put the locks on the door.  Let's say hi to Tommy on Long Island. 
[01:07:00]  Tommy.  Hey, Ant, I'm so sorry you've got to be going through this, bro.  Yeah, it's...  But these hospitals, the state funded a lot of them in order to...  Yep.  ...receive the funding.  They've got to pull crap like this.  Unfortunately...  It's all about money.  That's what this whole thing is about.  It's about, yeah, funding, and it's about insurance money.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that the insurance companies and the medical industry have this little thing going where the more doctors that can get money from the insurance companies, the more the insurance companies can pump up the premiums so everyone wins except you. 
[01:07:30]  How many times do you get your insurance bill and one month you get it and go, oh, they jacked this up by $150 with no explanation of why?  Yeah.  Oh, $150.  That's nice.  A month more.  Over the $500.  You know, for one person, I'm paying just about $600 a month in medical insurance for this. 
[01:08:00]  And now they're picking at it.  You know, they're picking.  I'll keep it a little longer.  We'll be able to pick at this policy for a little while.  It's all about cash.  Shit.  Not about people and individuals.  Man.  Oh, good luck, bro.  Thanks.  Good luck, bro.  Oh, wow.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Bobby in St. Louis.  Bobby.  How you doing?  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:08:30]  Your language, sir.  What did Jimmy do?  That's what he had?  You know.  He dumped out.  That guy just said, shut the F up to Jimmy.  Wow.  Jimmy hasn't even talked.  Jimmy said three things today.  I don't know.  Dave in Jersey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm sorry I'm going to go through this.  Look.  I've been through this before, actually, personally.  It's a huge machine that has complete control that you can't do anything about. 
[01:09:00]  You're so right, because I've never seen any other thing, any other entity than the medical industry that has this much power and control over people.  Like any other situation you could kind of work with and get around and do things.  This is so – it's so much red tape, and there's so many different people.  You never quite know who's in charge at what given time, where they are. 
[01:09:30]  The shift will change, and now the guy that's in charge is completely different.  And he doesn't know the case.  Who's the head guy?  Like who's the head muckety-muck in an office somewhere where I open up double doors and talk to the guy?  Like there isn't one of those.  It's this weird, frigging blob-like entity that you don't really understand.  It might be – for you going through this now and for your girl and for anybody listening – 
[01:10:00]  It's not me.  It is.  It's my girl going through this.  That's what's got me livid.  It's not – you know, if I was going through something so traumatic, I wouldn't be here right now.  I'd be, you know, crying somewhere.  It's probably the most inhumane thing you can really get wrapped up in, really.  To a sane person, it is despicable to put somebody in that situation where there are crazy people walking around screaming in the night. 
[01:10:30]  I mean, it's a nightmare.  It's a frigging nightmare.  All right.  Let's go to Debbie in Massachusetts.  Debbie.  Hi.  I had the same thing happen to me.  I drank too much vodka once.  I never drank vodka before, just probably like your girlfriend.  I drank a little bit too much, and I passed out.  And I don't know what happened.  My sister – anyway, they took me to the hospital.  They didn't know what was wrong with me.  I was like 110, 115 pounds of lightweight.  The same thing.  I was brought into the hospital.  They brought the psychiatrist and asked me a whole bunch of questions. 
[01:11:00]  And I thought that was the end of it.  And my boyfriend at the time, who's my husband now, you know, was there.  And the psychiatrist came in just the same way, asked me some questions.  And it was like, no, it was an accident.  It was a mistake.  Like, I didn't – you know, I didn't try to hurt myself.  I just – I didn't realize, you know, never drinking vodka before how it would affect me.  And they basically said voluntarily, or if I didn't voluntarily go, they would make me go.  Yeah.  And I didn't do the same thing.  I would – but I'm going to tell you, they're going to make her stay there for three days. 
[01:11:30]  They're not going to let her do anything on three days.  Because what they're doing is – they're blowing you off.  They're making it seem like they're going to have the doctor call you.  That makes me happy to hear.  Yeah.  I love being blown off like that.  Boy, that's part of my personality, isn't it, Oak?  Oh, I take these things well.  Yeah.  They're making – they're just going to – they're buying time.  But believe me, it's going to end up being the end of 72 hours.  It's going to be, no matter what you do.  Well, we'll see.  Yeah.  We will see. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  You're going to make some calls in –  Yeah, a few minutes, a half hour.  I've got to make some calls.  Five minutes.  I'm making calls.  Other people are making calls.  My sister's going down there and try to get some answers.  Yeah, maybe I should go with that helmet I was wearing on my head during the taxi competition.  Wow.  You got to tune in to this show every day from the beginning because I can't tell you how many people on Instant Feedback.  Can you give a recap of the situation? 
[01:12:30]  I just tuned in.  Tune in early.  Wake up.  Set your alarm, you lazy bastard.  We're lucky to have Anthony today.  Hate you people.  God.  All right.  Oscar De La Hoya is here.  Thanks, Cleveland.  You're blaming this on Cleveland?  You know something?  It was depressing enough to be there.  They should commit everyone that has to live in Cleveland.  I think that's probably why they committed this.  She was probably drunk and she said something like, Cleveland is beautiful. 
[01:13:00]  Like, get the pen.  Oh, my God.  She's insane.  Cleveland, there's a lot of nice people.  Get the pen.  Oh, jeez.  On an uptown.  On an all-new house.  House has to kill 50 deacons to get Anthony's girl out of the hospital.  Anthony meets house.  That's Richie Bender from his cell phone.  Thank you, Richie.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get Oscar in here as a little distraction.  Sure.  Maybe you can pop me in the head a few times and I'll forget. 
[01:13:30]  We'll try to distract for a little while.  We'll get Oscar in here.  Also, Pedro's coming in and I will not call Pedro by his real name during the entire interview.  Really?  He is Pedro.  That's what he gets on the street, I bet, every day.  Hey, Pedro.  That's what people do.  Kenny, anything?  No, of course not.  I want to see Oscar light Kenny up.  Huh?  He's a small fella.  But he's a technician.  Yes, he is.  Come on, Kenny.  You can make some calls. 
[01:14:00]  Anthony is very upset and his partner is G.H.  Get his girl out.  Unfortunately, this is one situation I can't help with.  See, isn't that amazing?  Like, Kenny could do anything.  Kenny's like super idiot.  A man.  Superman.  He's like Superman with a big R on his chest.  I plunked this phone down because I can't help it.  This is the one that sends me.  Oh, okay.  Amy in Oceanside.  Hey, I need you to stop your whining and get on with the show already. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, Amy.  Down the hall.  Amy, you cunt.  Hey, Amy.  Amy.  Yes.  Amy, you're a cunt.  There you go.  How about that?  I hope Al Duke's finger is working.  See you next Tuesday.  Amy can screw.  Oh, I bet she's a big fat pig, Amy, aren't you?  Big fat pig doesn't know what it's like to be in a loving relationship, do ya? 
[01:15:00]  Do ya?  Die.  Amy.  That's someone that just doesn't get what this show is about.  We share way too much about our personal lives.  Don't listen.  Way more than any other radio show in America.  Don't listen.  You should be listening to a morning zoo.  That's more your speed.  Right.  Listen to the zoo.  Sorry, I just had to make a point.  Oh.  Because it's amazing that people would actually say that.  Point made. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, if you're listening, this is very riveting.  So to actually call up and say, move on with the show and start being funny is completely  ridiculous.  Yeah.  We'll go to break with Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man.  The video is now up on YouTube.  It's being downloaded a lot or viewed a lot, I should say.  You don't really have to download videos on YouTube.  You just click and watch.  Yes, Kenny.  My young son was busting my chops.  He said my next song should be Goldfinger from the James Bond movie. 
[01:16:00]  Well, that's a good one.  Is that what he said or is that what you actually think to yourself?  Yeah.  No, it's my young son.  I don't buy it.  He's the man, the man with the Midas touch.  We got to get a better version of you singing Secret Agent Man, by the way.  Although this version is pretty funny because there's arguing going on.  He doesn't know when to start the song.  So the chorus comes in.  And then at the end of the song, the music stops and then he finally does the last verse.  It's just terrific.  Go to YouTube, throw Opie and Anthony in the search. 
[01:16:30]  You get to see Club Soda Kenny singing this little song.  No, not yet.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away. 
[01:17:00]  Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away. 
[01:17:30]  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[01:18:00]  Is this the chorus?  Yeah.  I thought a little lead went here or something.  A little more Secret Agent Man there, right?  Yeah, but there's another verse, but I don't know when to start.  Halt the direction.  Halt the direction.  Halt the direction.  It's a big dumb thumb moving.  Here it comes, Secret Agent.  Secret Agent Man.  Secret Agent Man. 
[01:18:30]  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Swing in on the Riviera one day.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, Rich Vos in studio, and Oscar De La Hoya.  He only has a few minutes, we just found out, but sorry to make you wait in the green room there, Oscar. 
[01:19:00]  No problem.  One of the greatest ever.  Don't mind at all.  Yeah, it was a little strange.  Oscar walked in and, you know, saying hi to everyone, and we're meeting him for the first time.  And then he points at Rich Vos and goes, weren't you on that comic show?  Last comic standing, right?  Yeah, last comic standing.  You don't know how much that hurt.  It hurt all the rest of us.  You would have been better off if you just, like, slapped all this in the face and then shook Rich's hand.  Actually, you know what?  Now that I think about it, you guys look familiar, too. 
[01:19:30]  Okay.  I don't know if he's telling the truth, but I'm going to go, okay, just to blow out your stupid candle.  Why don't you hang in rest areas?  Oh, boy.  You know what he could do, right?  Are you crazy?  Are you crazy?  It was a joke against Norton.  And, Kenny, if anything happens, do not protect Rich Vos.  Let it just happen, please.  I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of that.  Well, Rich, the one you know, has a question for you.  Why don't you ask him the question that you asked us just before you walked in?  What's up, Rich? 
[01:20:00]  It's a good one.  Talk to me.  Who do you think your toughest fight was?  You never fought, like, Hagler or anybody like that.  I wouldn't even think about that.  But you never fought Hagler.  I just want to say, like, what year was Hagler fighting?  Oh, he was fighting in the 70s, right?  70s.  I was just born.  Yeah.  So that's what I just wanted to ask you.  Have you ever fought Marvin Hagler?  And who is next?  LaMotta?  You want to know if you ever fought LaMotta?  Or Sugar Ray Robinson?  Did I look that old?  Did I ever fight Jack Johnson? 
[01:20:30]  Jesus, Rich.  Yeah, are you trying to say that he looks that old?  He wants to know.  He doesn't even look like a fighter.  That's how good he looks.  He doesn't look like he's ever been hit.  Like, I met Thomas Hearns, who was kind of, like, punch drunk, and he could barely talk.  So he doesn't even look like...  You know, now to think about it, didn't you win last Comic Standing?  He's basically saying, where's the funny?  He's basically telling you, where's the funny?  Or he's saying you talk like you have cerebral palsy.  Because that's what I wanted this year. 
[01:21:00]  Josh Blue.  Yeah, Oscar, why no scars?  I just...  You got a great cut man, doctor.  Good cut man, good doctor.  It looks like your face has never been touched.  You know, it's funny.  It looks like a goddamn actor.  You know what I really, I truly use is, after every fight, I put cold steak in my face.  Really?  Yeah, I do that.  And it really works.  It really does.  Dude, you've won 11, unless this is wrong, 11 world titles in six different weight classes. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, in six different weight classes.  Is it easier to get heavier and fight, or to get lighter and fight?  I think it's easier.  It's tougher to, obviously, jump different weight classes.  I mean, that's why you don't see many fighters do it.  But, you know, it's been, I fought, I fought, what's his name, Bernard Hopkins, who's a partner  of mine now, at 160, a middleweight, and he was just too big, just too big.  I mean, this guy's huge and too strong. 
[01:22:00]  What weight were you more comfortable at, like in the 130s, 140s?  Oh, 140s.  Yeah, 147.  So, that's where I had my best fights against, you know, the Sugar Shane Mosleys, and I  had this fight against this African kid, Ie Korte, which was a classic, I mean, so.  Well, Shane Mosley, he beat you twice.  Yeah, he beat me twice.  And that was, have you ever beat him or no?  No, no.  He's just the guy that had your number?  Bring that up.  Well, I mentioned him, I believe you, I wouldn't have poked him with that one.  Well, that's what you get for mentioning Rich Voss, you saw him on TV, I have to bring  up Mosley. 
[01:22:30]  What is it about him that gave you such trouble?  You know what, his speed.  He's just, he's just a fast fighter.  I mean, he doesn't really hit too hard, but he's a fast fighter.  How quickly do you know, uh-oh, I think I'm in trouble with this guy?  Right from the get-go.  Really?  Right from the, right, first punch.  So, what happens, you make it through the round, you sit down, do you say that to your  corner guy?  Do you go, look, I'm in trouble here?  Or do you try to, you know? 
[01:23:00]  You kind of keep it to yourself because the camera's on you and you don't want like millions  of people watching you saying, holy shit.  You're like, ah, oh my God, I'm getting my ass handed to me out there.  Wow, that's, that has got to be rough.  That's unbelievable that you know from the first punch.  Right from the first punch.  Literally from the first punch, you know.  And the speed, the power, you know.  And the other way around, do you know from the first punch, like, man, I got this guy.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's, that's, it's funny, but that's the way it is, yeah.  So, you've gotten punched by somebody and went, ugh, 11 rounds, two minutes, 58 seconds 
[01:23:30]  to go.  Well, this kid I mentioned, I, Korte.  I mean, oh.  I literally thought he had bricks in his hands.  I mean, the first punch he hit me with, I said, whoa, I mean, check these guys' gloves.  I mean, this guy can hit.  And it lasted 12 rounds.  And in that last round, I had to win the last round to win the fight.  And I had him on the ropes for, like, a minute, just punches after punches.  And he wouldn't go down.  And this guy just was, I mean, he was an animal. 
[01:24:00]  And you beat him, though, right?  I beat him, yeah.  Who have you, you lost four fights.  I mean, 38, what is it, 34?  Is your record 30?  38 and 4, yeah.  You lost to Mosley twice.  Mosley twice.  Hopkins.  Hopkins.  And who was the other one?  And the other one was Trinidad, Felix Trinidad.  Is that three different weight classes?  That was, yeah, three different weight classes, yeah.  The Felix Trinidad fight was a little, I would want to say a little controversial.  I think that fight there should have gone my way. 
[01:24:30]  I think it should have gone my way.  But, you know, judges will be judges.  Do you guys ever, like, I mean, there's certain judges.  Do you look at certain judges and go, all right, I know this guy is going to, like,  do you have any power of having, like, almost like a judge in a trial, if you feel he's biased,  you can petition to have him removed?  Is it like that in boxing, if there's a judge you feel kind of has, like, a problem with you?  You can, you can.  Beforehand, they give you a list of judges.  But, I mean, in this game, in boxing, I mean, that's one of the problems we have is that judges,  you just never know who they're going to go for, you know? 
[01:25:00]  Was Tyson, as a fighter, was Mike Tyson, I watched Tyson, it was like the whole country,  all we're doing is waiting for him to recapture what we saw in, like, 1980,  which obviously is not going to happen.  Right.  Was he as great a wrecking ball, a fighter, as everybody thought?  Or was he just really did have a bunch of weaker fighters that made him look like he was invincible?  Tyson, Tyson was an animal.  I mean, this guy, we probably won't see another heavyweight champion like that in many years, you know?  I have a little eight-month-year-old son, so I think in about 20 years we'll see, you know, 
[01:25:30]  see him up in the ring.  Training him.  Training him already.  Yeah, yeah.  Who is your idol, Chavez?  Chavez, who does either Chavez, Sugar Ray Leonard, you know, Marvin Hagler.  Who do you think is the greatest fighter of all time?  Of all time, I would have to say Sugar Ray Leonard is up there, obviously.  I mean, obviously Muhammad Ali.  Joe Louis was studying his fights.  I think he was one of the greatest, too, so.  How about Foreman?  Foreman was good. 
[01:26:00]  Foreman was good.  He was just good, though, okay.  He was good.  Yeah, but he also retired when he was at the top of his game, so you don't even know what  he was capable of doing.  Yeah, exactly.  And then comes back when, what, he was 38 or something like that?  Well, he came back, I think, at 50, didn't he?  No, he was in his 40s to fight.  I know he worked away when he fought Holyfield and he lost.  I think it was a 15-round decision, I want to say, or a 12-round decision he actually lost.  No, but he won the world title, I think, at his last fight against Michael Moore.  He knocked him out at 50 years old or something.  I didn't know he had to do anything.  Yeah, but Michael Moore is, like, just a fact movie maker. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, he writes, oh, he writes silly books, sorry.  What a dope I am, I'm like, oh.  I get confused.  Hey, I'm actually getting a note, he has to go.  Are you leaving?  Oh, yeah.  You got a very busy schedule or something?  Busy, busy.  I'm saying that.  What are we out plugging?  I'm Oscar promoting the boxing legend, Oscar De La Hoya hosts Hispanic Heritage Month.  The world premiere is September 29th.  Is that tonight?  I'm really bad with dates.  That's tonight, yeah, September 29th.  Which is tonight at 8 o'clock on, it's on the history. 
[01:27:00]  No, that's tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I'm just glad I didn't screw up.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait, Oscar and I made a mistake.  I've been hitting the heavy bag lately, too.  It's funny.  I was going to talk to you about, like, maybe your message is similar to mine or whatever.  The great Oscar De La Hoya hosts, it's tomorrow night, 8 o'clock on the History Channel.  And right now, it's cool, his camera crew is in here filming a documentary.  Is this part of what you're showing tomorrow or no?  No, no.  What we're showing tomorrow is a documentary on the Mexican-American War. 
[01:27:30]  Since it's Hispanic Heritage Month, I thought it was a great idea to show what really happened in the Mexican-American War, where it happened, why it happened.  So I think it was a good educational piece, especially for youth of today.  Well, this is why you're a nice guy.  Because the fact that I asked about a man filming right now, is this being shown tomorrow on national television?  Yeah, I was going to bring that up and I passed.  He should have just smacked me in the face and politely answered because he's a nice guy.  It's live right now, Jim.  I'm really happy you came, man.  We really are.  I mean, it's very rare you get.  He's the most famous guy we'll probably ever have in the studio. 
[01:28:00]  I'm really happy that you came.  I doubt it.  No, there's no one bigger than you in the world.  I appreciate that.  What we're going to have in here.  I mean, who?  Maybe Jet Lake.  All right, you're probably second in Jet Lake.  Oh, definitely.  What about Pedro?  Pedro?  Pedro's coming in in like 10 minutes.  Is that the...  From Napoleon Dynamite.  The Pedro guy?  From Napoleon Dynamite.  I can't even compete with that guy.  I hope he's so terrible if you want to say his real name.  I'm going to ask.  This is for my own use.  This is probably sold.  Ask him to sign a glove.  Nice.  On here is Jake LaMotta, Emil something, and two other guys. 
[01:28:30]  Nice.  I think Jerry Cooney and one other guy.  And this is going to go...  Please just scribble over Jake LaMotta's autograph.  How funny about that if you put it on and knock my teeth out.  And then refuse to sign.  All right, guys.  Well, thank you for coming, man.  We really saw you on the event.  Absolutely.  And one more time, man.  One more time.  It's tomorrow night, 8 o'clock on the History Channel, hosting a Hispanic Heritage Month  world premiere about the Mexican-American War.  Mexican-American War.  Okay. 
[01:29:00]  Good.  Remember that one.  Jim?  It kind of sucks we only had a few minutes with you, but they are handing me notes, so  you must have a very busy schedule today or something.  Hey, Rich, do you want to ask me if he was around boxing, maybe doing stuff with the  troops during the Mexican-American War?  Any more?  Yeah.  One more question from Rich Voss.  Go ahead, Rich.  Rich.  Carlos Mancia.  Funny, not funny.  What do you think?  Funny.  I don't have a question.  A boxing question.  Gentleman Jim Corbett.  A boxing question.  I asked greatest fighter of all time, come up with something for him real fast before 
[01:29:30]  we go.  His wife's helping him.  This should be a doozy.  It was a great fight to throw in Manila, but the fight before it was Jeff Smith and Kareem  Allain.  I have nothing.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  You meant you got Oscar De La Hoya and you mentioned a guy named Jeff Smith?  What are you talking about?  Ben, what's the most realistic boxing film that you've ever seen?  Like, which one shows fighting and fighters the way it really is?  Well, you can't go wrong with Raging Bull, obviously.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I was watching the other day Cinderella Man, and that is, to me, the most inspirational movie. 
[01:30:00]  As a fighter, I mean, oh, it just, oh.  And that movie got great reviews, but no one went and saw it.  Right, yeah.  For some reason.  I don't want to see it, but it was such a great boxing movie, like a fighting movie,  but obviously Raging Bull.  What about when they hit?  All-time great.  All-time great.  What was it called?  When They Were Kings?  When We Were Kings.  When We Were Kings, yeah, with Ali.  That is an amazing movie.  That was a good movie.  Yeah, it was.  I always, when I hit the heavy bag, like, I basically should put on a dress and just slap 
[01:30:30]  it.  When I hit it, I think of the way Foreman would dent the heavy bag when he hit it.  Oh, he was an animal.  This guy was just, oh.  And you see him now?  Yeah.  You see him now, and he's the nicest guy you'll ever meet.  I mean, it's incredible.  Jimmy's dancing a pound cake.  When he had hair, he was nice.  Now that he's bald, he's like, you know.  I got another communicator.  He was the hair.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're, and it's written out this way, they're adamant about getting him out.  All right.  Sorry.  We love Oscar.  We can't help it.  I'm sorry.  We love him.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Thank you for coming in, Mel.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:31:00]  Oscar De La Hoya.  Appreciate it.  Thank you, Oscar.  Now you've got to walk out awkwardly, because we're not ready to take a break.  I'm sorry.  I'll follow him out.  Yeah, you can follow him out.  Thanks, Oscar.  Thank you, Oscar.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  There it is.  Look at Jimmy getting his autographs.  That's cool.  I'm going to think about that.  Getting it on video, and little E-Roc's flash camera.  Is that a my first camera, E-Roc?  You don't have to laugh so hard at my stupid joke. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, Oscar.  There he goes.  Does he feel bad for me today?  Oscar De La Hoya.  Yeah, I got one.  Dude, how cool is that?  You've got a boxing glove.  Yeah, man.  That's.  He was cool.  We could have done another half hour with that guy.  Yeah, I know.  He was great.  Jimmy gets the coolest stuff to have signed.  Like, it's not just, sign his piece of paper.  No, he went into a panic.  He didn't have anything for Oscar to sign.  So, he sent Nosferatu back to XM to get the glove.  And I thank you, by the way, to the intern who got it.  I was like, why didn't I get something for him to sign? 
[01:32:00]  I mean, it's like, I don't eBay any of this stuff, man.  This is going to go up in the apartment, and I'll save it.  But I got, I wish I had, Cooney, LaMotta, Oscar, Emil.  And Emil is one of the fighters.  He killed a guy in the ring years ago.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, many, many years ago.  Yeah, what year was that again?  Rich, I don't know.  But I heard, again, I'm not going to slam.  And he had to live with that his entire life, obviously, but...  The rumor I heard was that he was gay, and that it was...  Okay, that's...  All right, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  I knew there was a story behind this.  Sorry, guys.  Kind of common knowledge in the business, or whatever.  So, the story gets hot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there was the guy who was taunting him about it, or whatever, and he killed him in  the ring for it.  Wow.  That'll show you.  Yeah, that would definitely...  Tell him that you got his autograph.  I went to a boxing thing where I got Jake LaMotta.  I got everybody.  Not the dead guy.  The other guy.  All right, let's say hi to Nicky in New York.  Nicky!  I explain sometimes to Rich.  Nicky!  Nicky?  Nicky, New York.  Hello. 
[01:33:00]  Hi.  Hey.  Hi.  So?  You're on the air.  Question, please.  Question.  Okay.  I'm just wondering, do you guys shop at the Stupid People Store to get all your guests  on?  The Stupid People Store.  What are you talking about?  Where that...  There's retards to get on there, and then you guys think they're, like, so hilarious.  They're stupid.  Who, Oscar?  You don't like either of them like Oscar?  Okay, not Oscar, not Oscar.  All right, who are you talking about?  Are you talking about me, Rich Vosch?  Okay, no, I'm talking about the guy that was just on singing Secret Agent Man. 
[01:33:30]  You don't understand the Secret Agent Man song and the humor in that?  Wait, let's...  All right, so what do you...  What's the problem?  Okay, so he's like, he's got to be, like, slightly retarded, right?  Well, she's got to...  All right, so you're mad because we got someone that's slightly retarded singing Secret Agent  Man.  Well, okay, and the segment before that, you're, like, talking about people with suicide and  stuff, and then you have him on there, and you're cracking up at him.  I know.  I actually, to be honest with you, I mean, I'm on the show occasionally.  This is Jim Norton, and I agree with you.  I think sometimes the segments are very tastelessly mixed, and I don't like any type of humor being 
[01:34:00]  put in a certain way.  Anyway, I feel it was handled incorrectly.  Is that kind of the way you feel?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just, you know, exactly.  You know, you're talking about suicide, and you have a retard guy on there, and you're  cracking up at him.  Well, did you actually, have you, I mean, has suicide effects...  I have to tell you, I thought it was really stupid.  It wasn't even funny.  I couldn't agree more.  Have you had somebody in your life commit suicide?  I mean, I think it's a very serious subject.  Yes, I have.  You have?  Oh, I'll see.  There you go.  A little close to home. 
[01:34:30]  A little too close to home there, Nikki.  Nikki, thanks for the laugh.  That's what happens.  Now, that's awful, Nikki.  Wait, Nikki, Nikki...  You have to get, like, regular people on there that other people...  Nikki, did you have to clean up the blood yourself, or did you get a cleaning crew?  Who was it, Nikki?  Now, I save it for you, so you can come over and lick it up.  Nikki, who was it?  Gotcha.  Nikki, who was it?  Yeah, who was it?  That was just...  My cousin, my cousin.  Okay.  No.  One less C to Thanksgiving. 
[01:35:00]  Who cares?  That's terrific.  And I think that's terrible.  And how did...  What did this poor person do?  Well, what difference does it make?  I'm going to ask you, because I've had certain things like that affect my life, too.  What difference does it make?  Whatever joke we're going to say.  I'm not going to joke about it.  I don't think it's funny at all.  No, Jimmy...  Yeah, we'll stay out of this.  I don't think it's funny at all.  I've had stuff like that affect...  So was it a cousin you were close to?  No, not really.  Oh.  And what did he do to that person?  So it really shouldn't have affected you.  What's that? 
[01:35:30]  He blew his brains out.  He blew his brains out?  There you go.  Must not have left him much of a mess if he's a relative of yours.  Yeah.  You know, that's okay that you have the laughing machine in the background laughing.  Yeah, that's going to devalue you.  I'm going to laugh with my laughing machine.  I rule the world.  Laughing machine?  What friggin' year are you...  He blew his brains out.  So what happened?  You know that devalued all of his stuff at the garage sale? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  No, he hawked all that before we had a chance to do that.  Hey, Nicky.  Hey, what?  Do you realize we weren't even talking really about suicide?  We were talking about a situation where somebody was involuntarily admitted to a hospital.  Like, suicide...  We didn't get in-depth into suicide and the reason...  Like, it wasn't a suicide conversation, Nicky.  You took it as that.  You took it as that.  Yeah, what a...  It wasn't a joke thing. 
[01:36:30]  It was a story.  It was a real story.  The show is, like, starting to suck.  Then go listen to something else.  Starting to suck.  How long have you been listening, first of all?  A very long time.  A very long time.  And you listen on XM or on regular radio?  XM.  And you don't know who sang Secret Agent Man?  Long-time listener.  Don't know who that was singing.  Why don't you listen to the same thing your cousin listened to?  A bullet whizzing in.  Well, if your show doesn't get any better, I'll have no choice.  Don't try to be cutting, stupid. 
[01:37:00]  Nicky, you're lying.  You called up.  No one cares.  You're a fiver.  Nicky, let me tell you the reality of being a listener to this show.  You decide it's not for you anymore.  You go away.  Someone takes your place.  We don't give a crap.  We couldn't be happier.  Don't threaten us.  Don't make it like it's a threat that you're going to leave if we don't get funnier.  We don't want you.  Leave now.  We don't care.  Turn it off.  We don't care.  Turn it off.  We don't care.  We've been doing this for 12 years.  The only reason you're on the phone is so we can beat you up a little bit.  Do you, Nicky, do you have a... 
[01:37:30]  So everyone else can enjoy their morning.  Do you have your XM right there next to you?  No, I don't.  Then what do you...  How did you hear Secret Agent Man?  When I was getting ready for work.  Oh, oh.  I was going to have you turn it up and then change the station so we could actually hear  you not listening to us.  Well, it was so bad that I had a...  I have a joke.  All right.  You want some humor?  I got a...  Jimmy's got a good joke.  I got a joke.  Jimmy's got a joke.  You want humor?  Shut up.  I got humor.  That's the only thing you get to do different. 
[01:38:00]  You get to curse.  Say fuck, cunt, and then, you know, the people love to hear that.  Oh, we're not cursing...  Hey, stupid.  Hey, idiot that's been listening for years.  We're on regular radio right now, you dummy.  You ugly broad.  You're an ugly broad with no head-having cousin.  What do you think of them apples?  What do you think of them apples, headless cousin-haver?  I can't believe Nicky's my cousin.  Did you have to have two boxes at the funeral home? 
[01:38:30]  One for his head and the rest for his body?  Maybe if you were there for him, he wouldn't have done it.  He wouldn't have combed his hair with a shotgun.  Why don't you take a flying leap, you?  Hey, she laughs.  She likes the show now.  Two Jews walking to a bar, then they shot themselves.  A Polak, a Jew, and an Italian are shooting themselves.  I would have loved to have gone to that wake.  Like, you got the coffin, and then a little hat box to the left. 
[01:39:00]  I think we have a nomination.  That's right.  A little hat box.  A little hat box.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I don't give a crap about you, your cousin, or your wife.  That's right.  We think it's a hoot.  Is your last name Dwyer?  Are you done, Nicky?  Are you done?  No.  No, we could do this all day.  We're going to continue goofing on you and your hatless cousin. 
[01:39:30]  Well, bring it on.  Shut up.  All right, Nicky.  Why don't you show some dignity and just hang up.  Just hang up.  You've been beaten up already.  Just hang up.  Do what you don't do in your personal life.  Have some self-respect.  You tried to call the radio show.  You're obviously a lonely nothing of a person.  Just have some dignity and hang up.  Hold on a minute.  Here you go, Nicky.  Got this.  This is for you, buttercup.  There's a man who leads a life of danger. 
[01:40:00]  Everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  You're liking Nicky.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  That's my favorite part now, by the way.  Way your name.  Have a nice day.  She hung up. 
[01:40:30]  Did she?  I swear to God, she hung up.  I really wish Kenny was related to her as a cousin.  Let me just explain why I can no longer make eye contact with Kenny.  Not only did he not need a lyric sheet, he was holding the mic with both hands and shaking  it like he was the third superstar in the Idol Maker.  Who are you, Cesare?  I just want to take you where I'm going.  If anyone remembers that Ray Sharkey movie from the early 80s.  Go check out.  Have a little age, Ray.  Go check out the video of Kenny's thing of Secret agent man on YouTube. 
[01:41:00]  It's great.  Hey, Manny in Texas.  What's up?  Manny.  Manola.  Start off.  Anthony.  We're holding there.  Opie, that was the line of the day.  It wasn't even a line.  That was a well, perfectly timed laugh when that stupid bitch said about her cousin dying.  Yeah, that definitely is the nominee, the top nominee for the line of the day.  By the way, I went with the real laugh today instead of the obnoxious one, because I wanted  to hurt just a little bit more. 
[01:41:30]  Just a little bit more.  It was beautifully timed.  It was perfect.  Yeah, I got good comedic timing.  Thank you, guys.  I think.  All right, Manny.  Hey, we got to take a break.  Ant's got to do some phone calls.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  And we have a couple of guests as well.  Are they here yet or not yet?  Yes.  Oh.  Who's here?  Oh, Pedro's here.  Nice.  Ephraim.  Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite in studio next.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Can I do one thing before we go?  One more quick plug for Oscar De La Hoya hosting the Hispanic Heritage Month world premiere 
[01:42:00]  tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on the History Channel for the Mexican-American War.  And thank you to him for coming in.  Oh, my God.  Really fast.  We started something really crazy on our XM show.  We want to bring it to the commercial radio stations.  We got an update from Doug Out Doug.  Go, Doug.  I watched that dancing show last night, and I was gleaming as Jerry Springer stays yet  another week.  Yes.  Yeah.  We have decided to make Jerry Springer the winner of Dancing with the Stars or Dancing  with Stars or whatever the hell it's called. 
[01:42:30]  We need all the fans.  We forgot to mention that on this.  To vote for Springer.  He called in on XM.  He was actually very cool.  We would love to see him.  He promised to dedicate it to the Opie and Anthony Show if he wins.  And we know the show blows.  You don't have to watch it.  We're doing it.  Just vote for him.  Yeah, we just want to show the power of this radio show.  So it's Dancing with the Stars.  We're going to force them to make Jerry Springer the winner at the end of this thing.  Where do they go to vote?  I don't even know, Doug.  It's on the TV station website. 
[01:43:00]  I don't have the address on me.  But I can tell you this.  When the woman that got voted off started crying, when the hosts sighed and the crowd  booed, I felt energized.  Oh, is that great?  Jerry Springer cannot dance to save his life.  And he was shocked that he stayed.  If this guy goes another three weeks...  Get him on the phone.  Get Jerry Springer on the phone.  If he does it because we are influencing it, trust me, everybody out there, you'll feel 
[01:43:30]  great about yourself.  Who got voted off?  Harry Hamlin and I don't know who the dancer was.  Not Harry Hamlin.  Not Harry.  Remy.  Do you like him, Bonnie?  Well, his wife did so well last year.  Lisa Rinna?  Yeah, Lips Rinna.  Yeah, Lips Rinna.  Lips Rinna.  Oh, I like her.  You ever see her face without makeup?  It's a horror show, man.  It is a horror show. 
[01:44:00]  Like someone threw just a whole cup of acid right in her face.  Wow.  They cover up a world of hurt with that makeup.  So, Doug, your website is what and where do they go to vote for Springer?  Real fast.  We've got to take a break.  I have no idea.  No, come on, man.  Get the good plug in.  You don't get the good plugs over here.  You guys are hosting that incredible video from Cleveland, the foaming blank.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You were talking about my website.  That would be OAXperience.com.  OAXperience.com.  They have a video we can't host, unfortunately, because of the rules and regulations. 
[01:44:30]  So, we gave it to Doug.  It's a girl that was doing a thing in the studio in Cleveland.  It's foamed.  Yeah, it's Diet Coke and Mentos, but it's not the typical way you do those type of experiments.  It's foaming blank.  Fill in the blank and go check it out for yourself.  It looked like it had rabies.  And Doug, go to where to vote for Springer?  Yeah, see, that's what I thought you asked the first time.  That, I have no idea.  I guess you go to the ABC website and go with Dancing with the Stars or something like that. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, ABC, then, yeah, it's definitely on that website.  But you can only do it during the 30 minutes of the show on Tuesday nights.  We want everyone to vote for Springer as a goof, and we want to show the power of this show and make him the winner.  We did this with the Big Brother competition.  We did this with Rockstar, was it called?  Yeah.  Rockstar, we got a guy voted back on the show for a night.  So, we got a lot of power with this program.  Hey, Doug, you're a pretty big guy, right?  I remember you.  Yes.  Can you handle yourself physically? 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  All right, can you email me?  I got a question for you.  I don't need you to beat anybody up, but I just got a question for you.  No problem.  Thank you.  I don't have your regular email.  Thank you, cupcake.  All right, thanks, Doug.  Ant's got to make some phone calls.  Ray in St. Louis, real fast.  What's going on, guys?  You guys are killing me with the secret agent man song.  It's good, right?  I think it's great.  Day and night in the shower.  Oh, my God.  And it's awful enough to hear it, but then to hear it in his voice, it just makes it even  worse.  And I'm trying to sing it in his voice.  Hey, agent man. 
[01:46:00]  Look at this guy taking away my happiness.  Mike in Jersey, go.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Ope, I got to call you out on it.  Jimmy was ranting and rolling.  You threw that coffin line out there.  Got no response.  Waited about 30 seconds, threw it out again, and got a big laugh.  I got excited, and I had a...  What coffin line?  No, he threw it out better the second time.  I had enough confidence.  I knew it was going to work, but I got excited and jumped on Jimmy, which wasn't cool.  So I sat back, waited, and I knew it was going to work, so I did it again.  That happens from time to time on this show. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, sometimes you fire a line out a second time.  We've all done it where no one hears it, and you're like, all right, good.  I got to throw a free pitch, and then you do it again.  I got a genuine laugh out of it.  And you usually don't get genuine laughs from me, Jimmy?  No, out of a second time hearing it.  I don't hear a joke at the second time.  All right.  Bill from Waterford said I could take the rest of the day off, so I'm going to do that.  No.  So it's just going to be you and Rich at this point, because Ant's fighting for the line of the day.  Ant's doing good.  Ant's doing phone calls.  I don't need to work anymore today, so it's you two.  You guys just do the show.  Maybe I have Oscar come back. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  And we talk.  It's Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Rich Bonny.  And?  Mike Kenny.  And then Rock.  Is that our name now, Rich Bonny?  And them.  Rich Bonny.  And Travis.  Here with everyone else is talking about, O&A Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:47:30]  Anthony's back at studio.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I went out to make some phone calls.  Make some phone calls to no less than three doctors that could.  Oh, hold on.  Get it.  Hold on.  Jesus Christ.  I don't want to miss this one.  Your phone's ringing?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hello?  Speaking.  Oh, you actually got a person on the phone. 
[01:48:00]  Oh.  Hey, it's talking to the hospital.  Someone's on the phone.  He's getting an update on his girl.  I hear about the residence meeting all the time.  Yes.  Yes.  What do we do?  What do we do?  I don't know.  We either hear a very happy Anthony.  I want to set up a meeting where my girlfriend gets checked out of the hospital. 
[01:48:30]  That's what I want to do.  If that entails coming in and meeting and talking with you and the end result is getting out of the hospital,  then I am fully, fully enthralled to come and meet.  But, uh, no, no, no, no.  See?  Another lie.  I heard up to 72 hours. 
[01:49:00]  And, yeah.  There's another thing that I'm hearing.  Wait, I just want to explain to you what I'm hearing all the time.  What I'm hearing all the time is I'm not the one or I'm this one.  I'm not the one that does this.  I need the person that does the signing of the paper that gets my completely sane girlfriend out of an insane asylum. 
[01:49:30]  That's what I need immediately.  Where is Dr. Sanders?  Where's?  Okay.  I try to explain.  Oh.  Hi, Pedro.  Right.  Pedro just gave me a peace sign from over there.  Can you say awkward? 
[01:50:00]  Do you understand?  Do you understand she was?  Yes.  You, you do understand she was interviewed intoxicated.  You do understand one person interviewed her intoxicated.  And based on that, she was involuntarily admitted.  And when she sobered up, she even said she has no recollection of what she even said to that shrink. 
[01:50:30]  Uh, and then was thrown upstairs with, with, with, uh, uh, people that do have to be up there.  And she's fine.  And no one I talk to has the power to, this is what is annoying me.  No one I am talking to, they are giving me no one to talk to that has the power to go, yeah, I'm the guy that makes the decision to sign out this person.  You're telling me you don't. 
[01:51:00]  He's listening.  He's listening.  He's listening.  He's listening on the phone.  Apparently she's giving him directions to the pit.  Have you, have you spoken to her?  Have you spoken to her?  This weekend. 
[01:51:30]  Have you spoken to her?  Leave it after the show today.  Tonight through Saturday.  Nice.  Are you listening to me?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, I'm talking to her.  Oh, no, we're not listening, Ant.  We're doing a show.  You just keep doing what you're doing over there.  Oh my God, my heart stopped.  So you haven't, you haven't even personally sat down and spoken to her.  My heart.  So, so, so here's what I get.  No, no, you, please.  Please.  I know you, you do a lot of the, please listen to me.  Please listen to me for a second. 
[01:52:00]  How have you not sat down and, and spoken to her?  And, and that can't give you a very good gauge on whether this is just another person going,  I'm fine.  Or, or a boyfriend going, she's fine.  You, you haven't even talked.  If you sat down for five minutes and spoke to her, you would go, oh my, if you, if you knew what you were doing,  which I'm not saying you do or don't, but I'm just saying if you knew, you would sit and go, oh my God, what is this girl doing in here? 
[01:52:30]  I would suggest talking to her.  The doctors that no one, the doctors that have met with her, the ones that we can't ever talk to for some reason.  Then, those are the ones.  Okay. 
[01:53:00]  Say, how about, how about, how about an hour?  I can be there in an hour.  How about 930?  Unfortunately, why?  You're having an offsite meeting.  Here's another thing that bugs.  Here's another thing that bothers me a lot.  Every time I try to get in touch with one of the doctors that can do something, they're in some meeting, a conference, and now an offsite meet. 
[01:53:30]  Is that a golf game?  Please be honest with me.  It's an offsite meeting chasing a titleist around a grassy field because I want to talk to somebody that signs the paper.  Dr. Sanders.  Where is Dr. Sanders at 930?  You know how much more crazy I am than, than, than she is? 
[01:54:00]  You're going to see if he's available at 1130.  So, Pedro, you're in a new movie?  Yeah, you can't speak for them.  I'm not asking you to speak for them.  I'm asking to speak to them.  I, you don't understand.  How frustrating this is.  And no matter how much of the voice you put on, the calming thing they teach you in school, I am fucking livid. 
[01:54:30]  You don't understand how upsetting this is because she is so upset.  Because she got drunk because her boyfriend of seven years, who she's never had an argument with, had an argument with her.  And she decided she was going to get drunk like I did two nights before that because I was in an argument with a girl that we had never been in an argument in seven years.  And she went on a bender.  And she went on a bender.  That's, that's it. 
[01:55:00]  And now, uh, an interview she had with, uh, some shrink, totally wasted, comes into play.  I can't get, uh, uh, an answer from anybody.  I can't talk to a doctor that, that can give me an answer.  I talk to people like you and like the nurse desk and people that blow me off and give me these bullshit answers about how we're cool.  We could set this up.  There's no guarantees, this, that. 
[01:55:30]  I want an answer.  Tentatively scheduled for 1130.  1230, one.  How was it working with Jessica Simpson?  What's this on?  Hot.  Hot.  You know what, though? 
[01:56:00]  This is what happens.  I was being straightforward.  Uh, someone said they were being straightforward to me yesterday.  Also, when I was promised a phone call from Dr.  Sanders, which I never got.  This straightforward crap, uh, isn't working.  I'm not believing it.  I'm, I'm seeing a bunch of lying people here.  A bunch of people that are putting me and my girl off.  That are pushing things hours ahead until, until conveniently enough.  Oh, it's too late.  You know what I want to do? 
[01:56:30]  I want to meet with someone ASAP so she could get out of there today.  Today.  What are you doing right now?  What do you have scheduled for right now?  Team report.  What is team report?  How about you schedule a meeting with my girlfriend? 
[01:57:00]  That way you can talk to her.  I'm not being abusive, abusive.  Wow.  I am being adamant.  I am being passionate.  I am being upset.  You're, you're, you're going to call me back in 10 minutes.  And.  And I was hung up on.  I was hung up on, on, by a social worker, a social worker.  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah.  She didn't hang up on you. 
[01:57:30]  No, she did.  Oh.  I was hung up.  I'm, cause that was a three way call with a sister.  Oh, okay.  That's nuts.  And I'm being abusive.  Right.  To her.  You know.  Don't throw it.  You're going to need this phone.  Don't throw it.  No, I need this phone.  Don't throw it.  This phone would be through the wall.  That's what you deal with.  That's what you deal with, with the medical community.  It's offsite thing.  This, the past three days have been nothing, but this offsite, these vagaries of what these 
[01:58:00]  doctors do, these vague, they're doing, they're at a conference or this offsite, offsite.  Hey, you hooked that one.  That's what an offsite meeting is.  I'm being, she, these, these motherf, they put me through the, and, and my girlfriend,  more importantly, through, through this crap.  And I'm the one that's being abusive. 
[01:58:30]  You weren't being abusive.  You lock people up.  I'm trying to get an honest goddamn answer out of these people.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  I'm going to tentatively set up a meeting at 1130 and see if I could get this guy.  No guarantees are ever made.  If that doesn't work, it'll be 1230.  If that doesn't work, she goes, then I'll try for 130.  And then the time goes by.  Here's how it, because it's happened.  The time ticks by and then it ends up, well, it's too late. 
[01:59:00]  You got to wait another day.  Oh, my God.  I could not be more pissed off at anything.  This is the most pissed off I've been at human beings.  At human beings.  Oh, my God.  The medical community are a bunch of fuckos.  Find me, use the word. 
[01:59:30]  It's a new cereal by Kellogg's.  Bunch of F's and O's.  Oh.  We should take a break.  What?  This is a...  Oh.  Hold on.  Well, maybe not.  So employee of the month, huh, Pedro?  What is that?  I concur.  What happened, Abe?  What happened?  Nothing.  I'm just getting a text from my girlfriend's sister. 
[02:00:00]  She's just got to, like, call that woman back, I guess, and give her the rational good cop portion of that program.  Right.  What kind of social worker, because you weren't being abusive, you were just annoyed, interprets that as abuse.  You see how they overreact.  What a...  Like, she can't handle having a heated discussion with someone who doesn't agree with her?  No.  No.  Ugh.  That's a social worker?  Jesus.  If they aren't all nice to her, she loses it and hangs up? 
[02:00:30]  What a pig.  Unbelievable.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  All right.  I'll make one more phone call.  Monsters.  You're leaving?  No.  If we're taking a break.  Yeah.  We're taking a break.  I asked Mark if we could go late on this side of the show.  What did he say?  We're still talking to him.  We're still talking to him.  What is he having?  He's having an off-site meeting?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  We go late.  If the affiliates want to keep going with us, then they keep going with us.  That's what I say.  Okay.  Can we see the way Mark slacks fit?  It's Opie Anthony, Jim Norton, and Pedro. 
[02:01:00]  Hello.  Employee of the month?  Employee of the month with Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson.  What?  Holy Jesus.  Sorry you've been there.  No, no.  I'm right there with you.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him next, okay?  Can I go right now?  Go for it, dude.  Go for it.  Your real name's Efron.  Who's that?  Efron?  Efron.  Efron.  Yo, what up?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Hey there.  Hi there.  Ho there.  What?  All right.  We'll continue in just a minute.  It's Opie Anthony.  No, no worries, man. 
[02:01:30]  And a lot of other people, including all Jimmy Norton, who will be at the Pittsburgh Improv all  week and long story tonight.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  To the affiliates.  We're going a little late today.  We might make it to 930.  If you want to continue with us, great.  If you want to play some classic rock, do that.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Do what you have to do.  But we're going a little late here before we move over to XM exclusively, okay? 
[02:02:00]  Look at Boston.  Leave it to Boston with that call.  What?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Line three.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't going to go there, but Mike.  No, no.  Mike in Boston, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  What's up, guys?  How you doing, Mike?  Hey.  Yeah, leave it to Boston, right?  Hey, listen, common sense isn't working.  Being civil isn't working.  Walk in, walk out.  End of story.  Deal with the repercussions afterward.  Well, Mike, that was the in case of emergency, break less. 
[02:02:30]  And I was getting very close to that point where I was going to pull the Cobra up.  And you would see a wonderful, Fox 5 would probably cover it,  a wonderful high-speed chase of a Shelby GT500 Cobra.  And probably what would be great is one of those new,  what are the cops using these days?  The new pursuit vehicles.  The Chargers.  I'd blow the doors off.  I'd defy any cop out there to catch me in their Charger. 
[02:03:00]  I'm putting a challenge out to the police.  Oh, Chris.  I'm kidding.  I'm totally kidding.  Police officers.  You've lost his mind.  Now he's attacking the people that love us.  Hopefully all I can do is throw my pile of PBA cards out  and hope it covers his windshield.  Hopefully you got a full house.  But no, dude, it was like you were saying.  You go fast in that car,  and what are they going to do to stop you and find the car?  What are they going to do?  Right.  Who cares?  I got a couple of keys in the trunk.  Fine. 
[02:03:30]  You think I'm popping the trunk for them?  They're going to have to work for it.  I love when people are trying to tell you what you can do.  Dude, if the police officer doesn't have a comment and say,  please, you don't have to let them search the car.  You can go.  You're free to go.  Well, in the crime, man, just walk out of the hospital.  No, actually, it is a crime.  We got an update.  Late breaking news.  We went into the break,  and Anthony went into the office to make some more phone calls.  I got a call waiting as I was talking to my girlfriend's sister who was going to play the good cop to my just what you heard on the other bad cop to the social worker. 
[02:04:00]  And I guess she had a couple of minutes to think it over, the social worker, and I got a call back.  And I do have a meeting to go to at 1130.  She goes, come in for the meeting, and your girlfriend will be discharged immediately after the meeting.  She goes, everything is being set up.  She will be discharged.  I think that might have gotten to – I think actually either that might have happened or they will commit me based on that phone call. 
[02:04:30]  Could you do us all a favor and have the meeting in the parking lot?  Because I think it's got to be a public place.  Maybe on a picnic table so you have a chance to run if they do go after you.  So far it looks like good news because there is – she spoke with everybody, all the parties involved, meeting 1130 just to meet face-to-face,  and then everything is being put through, and she will be released today.  Please show up in the Nazi helmet. 
[02:05:00]  You want me to show up with the Nazi helmet?  Please don't mention it.  Just talk very logically.  Just talk completely normal with the Nazi helmet on?  Say, look, the problem with psychiatry – and then just have the Nazi helmet on.  Tell her she's being so glib.  Yes.  Just say – I say, look, this is a big problem here.  I'd like to exterminate it.  I think I have the final solution to this problem.  I want you to show up with just your underpants on and black socks.  And the Nazi helmet.  And the Nazi helmet.  I'm here to get my girlfriend.  Hey, really fast before we move on. 
[02:05:30]  You have a guest.  Yes.  Tomorrow is the last day of our production contest that went horribly wrong.  It went so fast.  Went horribly wrong once again.  And we're just trying to give you guys some cool stuff.  And I don't know.  We'll have to go back to the drawing board on this.  Oh, who knows?  We'll see what the top five entries end up being.  But we've been asking you for a production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  And next week we're going to announce the best five entries.  You have one more day to submit your entry at 923freefm.com.  Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. 
[02:06:00]  That's it.  No more entries can be submitted.  You better hurry up with some good ones.  And then next week we'll give out five MacBooks to the best five.  All right?  All right.  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities.  And you can take it with you wherever you go.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out for yourself.  And I'm leaving for Pittsburgh right after this.  Because I know you're not going to make your meeting, by the way, because you have to be on until 11.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  So I'll be – wow.  What time are you leaving?  Whenever you are, boss. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  That show's all yours, Rich.  I hope he's leaving, too.  We'll do the show again.  I didn't even bother to turn your mic on.  Sorry.  Yeah, I will be leaving a little early today.  Yeah, me too.  Hey, who is this IMing me on such a happy day with – let's see.  No sound.  Uh-oh.  Oh, someone's – okay.  No, I'll throw him the bone.  I'll turn the mic back on.  Don't IM a thank you or I will bounce you.  Steve turned it off.  I asked him to because we were talking about decisions he's making. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't know they speak bear.  Do you understand him?  Can we say hi to Pedro?  He's been sitting for an hour.  I know.  I feel so bad.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  There is this tremendous personal issue going on, and it's finally being resolved.  I think you should show up with a Nazi hat, your boxers, your black socks, and a Vote  for Pedro t-shirt, and you'll be fine.  I hate you because of those Vote for Pedro shirts.  Is that you?  I love Napoleon Dynamo.  Yes, that's him.  Oh, wow.  Of course it is.  I love – 
[02:07:30]  See?  No, but the Vote for Pedro shirts.  Yeah, could you –  I think I'll build her a cake.  You see?  Perfect.  That was my impression of you from Napoleon Dynamo.  It was very funny.  Very funny.  But wherever you go is the Vote for Pedro t-shirt.  That's got to make you happy, but to see it over and over and over again, wherever you  walk in Manhattan, every kid has a Vote for Pedro t-shirt.  Did you get tired of seeing our billboards on the buses?  No, because it's about us.  Right, because it's about us.  And that's what he's thinking.  If I had a sweatshirt that said Opie and Anthony, of course I'd be spoiling it every day. 
[02:08:00]  Can I make an observation?  Usually we have a fun show, a lot of chuckles, and Pedro, real name I can't pronounce, walks  in the door, and he's all happy, like he's light in his step, has a little spring to  his step, he walks around the corner over there, and all he sees is all hell breaking  loose with you on the phone, yelling, screaming at somebody in a hospital, and his whole mood  changed.  He tiptoes to the couch and sits down, and doesn't say a word pretty much for an hour. 
[02:08:30]  I got to apologize.  He's just been sitting there for an hour.  He walked into a really stupid radio show.  But he got it, though.  He just stopped and was like, oh, okay, something weird's happening.  Something odd is happening.  You can hear a man on the phone with a psychiatrist on a radio show.  Commitment, then problem.  I'm like, okay, this is a serious issue.  Yeah, it was a little, it was not like your normal morning zoo show.  I felt right at home.  Did you?  I was like, mom, dad, are you here? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no.  What?  A couple issues.  Everyone's got their cross to bear, you know?  Yeah.  It just happens.  But, yeah, hopefully that's all straightened out.  But now I could go back to being a radio guy.  New project?  Employee of the month.  Employee of the month.  Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson.  Dane Cook, who is just blown up.  Yeah.  He is a huge.  I love that guy.  He's doing SNL this weekend, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The premiere, I think, right?  Second time, yeah.  I got to officially announce it.  What?  He's gotten too big for the show. 
[02:09:30]  What?  It happens with all you guys.  We get you on the way up, and we get you on the way down.  Who's the musical guest?  I don't know, but Dane Cook has done our show over the years.  He did our show in studio and a phone call to promote his HBO.  Two-egasm, right?  No, well, what was it called?  The Vicious Circle.  The Vicious Circle, which was unbelievable.  He's in town.  SNL doesn't need us anymore.  You know, he should be in studio or at least calling us.  Is that going to happen?  Where's Roland? 
[02:10:00]  Let's get Roland.  Where's Roland?  Yeah, let's get Roland.  Are we getting dinged?  I hear a phone ringing.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Keep talking.  We regret you.  I think we're going to get him.  We'll get you in front of you.  Text.  Hold on.  What?  Next week, Dane's going to call in.  Why not while he's in town doing SNL?  I'm trying to get him.  Well, he's on rehearsals all this week, so we're trying to get him in the studio next week.  What time does he rehearse?  I know that they rehearse, but they don't rehearse that early.  But doesn't he want to promote the season premiere of SNL that he's on? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  The thrillers are the music.  The thrillers are the musical guests.  The killers.  Yeah.  Those are cool, too.  So we're not getting him until next week when he's done with SNL.  Yeah.  That's usually the routine is for all the hosts, though, because they're...  All right.  All right.  We'll have to wait and see.  He's been a friend of the show, so I'll take your word on that.  By the way, in studio tomorrow, Jet performing live.  If you guys get, and it might happen, we don't know, but Arlie Ermey, the drill instructor  from Full Metal Jacket, if he's here tomorrow while I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm going to set fire 
[02:11:00]  to the improv doors and all shows will be canceled.  If I miss the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket to be in Pittsburgh, I will shoot myself  and everybody in the room.  And Matthew Modine next week, too.  Oh, that's a show you should go to, then.  It's going to be a hot ticket.  That's right.  Then your cousin will call in next week.  All right.  So the new movie...  How did we all bomb on that one?  That was like a softball lobbed up.  It was three big swings and three big whooshes.  Yeah.  Well, that's why I was going right back to Pedro to save the day. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, before we talk about the new movie...  I'll be wild as Jesus come true, for sure.  Before we talk about the new movie, you know, I'm sure you've answered this a million times,  Napoleon Dynamite.  You came out of nowhere, right?  You weren't acting or anything like that before that movie.  What?  Were you acting?  Or were you?  I don't know.  To be or not to be, that is the question where there's no one in the mind.  So you did high school plays like I did.  High school plays.  You had been doing theater in Los Angeles for a while.  I was in Bye Bye Birdie.  Have you heard Mockingbird? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I was one of the singing teenagers.  Of course.  Of course.  I did that, too, in high school.  You know?  Yeah, I studied Shakespeare and improv and, you know, Violet Spoon's work and Udaha  Hagen and Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner.  Isn't that right?  And Stanislavski's work.  So how does it feel like it's an acting?  Because I've done a little acting, a little being the operative word, to have done, like,  all that stuff and all that training.  And then you get known for this weird role and it's like everybody calls you by that,  like, character name.  Well, you know, there's the inside work and there's the outside work. 
[02:12:30]  You know, everybody recognizes me as the outside world of the work, you know, and it's always  about the work.  You know, you do theater and you study, like, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, you  know, and David Mamet.  And, you know, it's – there's three parts to it that I always see it as.  It's acting for the artist, right?  Acting in the business and acting in the business of Hollywood.  You know, for the artist, it's always about the self-work and how to improve your technique,  you know, and how to master the craft.  The acting in the business is understanding who the directors are, the producers, the 
[02:13:00]  cast directors.  The business of Hollywood is like the whole, you know, dealing with the fans and dealing  with the red carpet and the cameras and all the glitz and glamour.  And, you know, that's all good.  They don't got to tell us.  You know?  So – but it's always about the work, you know?  I mean, you guys are here.  We're doing the work all the time.  Yeah.  No matter what.  And we – this is our passion.  We love doing this.  We love to communicate, to connect.  Who knew Pedro was brilliant?  I know.  And so well-versed in acting.  I know.  I thought we'd get a couple of goofy Napoleon Dynamite, you know, lines out and kick your 
[02:13:30]  ass out the door.  But the guy is smart.  I got to ask you a couple of things.  One, the – I did love Napoleon Dynamite, of course.  It's fantastic.  What was the deal with the wig?  Like, that seemed like it was – there was a reason it was put in that we weren't being  told.  Was it just to be weird or did something happen?  You know, the director who wrote it with his wife, Jerusha, and I love those guys, they  wrote what they knew, right?  And his wife's little brother actually felt hot one day, so he shaved his head. 
[02:14:00]  You know, it's like – so a lot of the scenes actually occurred.  Like, the guy played Kip.  His little brother really ordered a time machine online.  That's insane.  You know –  It doesn't work.  I thought it would work.  Like – so – and the whole crystal – you forgot to put in the crystal.  I mean, that really did happen.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  And Preston, Idaho is really like that.  And did you make many Waterworld jokes with your co-star? 
[02:14:30]  I forget her name at this point, but she was adorable in Waterworld.  Or Tina Majorino.  Yeah.  I love her.  You know, she's this girl.  Sweet girl.  Really sweet girl.  And I know she's working on Veronica Mars right now, right?  Oh, is she?  Yeah, yeah.  I hear that show's good.  After Napoleon Dynamite, everyone's career just blew up.  You know, and – and again, with the question about, you know, how do I feel about, you  know, being known as Pedro, the public eye knows me as Pedro. 
[02:15:00]  Then, you know, I just finished – Crank is still out in theaters where I'm playing  a transvestite, you know, and –  I thought I knew you.  Yeah.  I thought I knew you.  And my job as an actor is when you take on a role, you want to do something completely,  totally different.  And then you think of actors like Johnny Depp and Sean Penn.  Sean Penn, when he played Spigoli, right?  And then he did – that same year, he did Bad Boys, right?  Bad Boys, yeah.  So you go, huh, I looked at that career and I go, that's what I want to do.  You know, these guys are geniuses of our time.  Hey, just gave me an idea. 
[02:15:30]  Things don't pan out.  Pillowcase full of soda cans.  Nice.  There you go.  What a great scene that was.  Who's Warren Jerome?  Wow, you remember names and everything.  Yeah, I do.  But when it comes down to action, I can quote any film and yet when it comes down to acting,  I just stand there and I just kind of mumble and my hands move awkwardly.  And it's like – I actually walked out of an audition and I go, this sucks.  I stopped at the guy.  The guy goes, no, you're doing okay.  But then he let me leave.  He didn't stop me.  He didn't say come back. 
[02:16:00]  No, he was like, nah, you know, it was okay as the door was opening.  Hey, you're also a DJ, so I want to say it.  Yeah, I actually –  Do you do buttery beats?  Buttery beats?  Oh.  I was like, what?  Is that a song?  No, dude, I do a lot of mashups, you know, from – I mix hip-hop with, you know, classic  rock.  Of course.  You do any Sabbath?  Of course.  Any we know?  I haven't done that.  Well, we all know about Sweet Home Alabama, you know, Guns N' Roses, you know, The Cult.  You know, I like mixing Hard House with, like, bands like Depression Mode and Adamant. 
[02:16:30]  You know, I recently did Hard House with the Beatles and it was just great, you know?  You should have brought that in.  We would have played it for you.  Really?  Well, I got a website.  It's called EphraimRamirez.net and I also have a MySpace account.  It's MySpace.com slash EphraimRamirez.  And Ephraim is E-F-R-A-N.  E-F-R-E-N.  Oh, E-N, I'm sorry.  You got a –  E-F-R-E-N.  You got counterfeiters on there?  Let me tell you, I'll be EphraimRamirez, okay?  You got any – you got any people on there posing as you on MySpace? 
[02:17:00]  I got about, like, over 100.  Yeah.  And that – you go there and you go, that's not me.  It's not – you got everything wrong.  It's such a trip, you know, after the point of how many fans and how many people who wanted  acclaims and all that.  I'm thinking it's not good, you know?  Yeah.  It's nothing but love, you know?  Nothing but love and stalking.  I'll tell you guys, I was shooting Employee of the Month and it's like we were shooting  at 8 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock in the morning. 
[02:17:30]  I go back to my hotel room and, you know, we were shooting in Santa Fe as well as Albuquerque  and normally I would change my name like Johnny Depp.  Johnny Depp would change his name to Donkey Penis, so just think about my name.  So I would go back to my room and there's a girl sleeping on my bed.  And I thought, wow, room service.  This is great.  So I go back downstairs.  I talk to the manager.  The manager's like, well, you know, your girlfriend said she wanted to surprise you.  I'm thinking, wait a minute.  I don't have a girlfriend.  So, you know, I go back up.  Mind it, she's sleeping in her chonies, you know?  For those of you who don't know, she's in their underwear and that's it. 
[02:18:00]  And right next to her, she's got a bag.  In the bag, she's got the Voper Pedro t-shirt, the DVD, the bobblehead, and a little action  doll figure.  You know?  I'm thinking, what?  So I kind of poke her, you know?  And then I go, hey, you know?  And she wakes up.  She's like, oh, I'm trying to explain herself.  You know, I give her a couple of autographs.  We go downstairs.  We have breakfast.  And two weeks later, I end up having dinner with her family just to make sure that she  was okay, you know?  Are you going to tell me you didn't hit it?  He said he poked her.  You didn't hit that?  A girl in your hotel in her underpants? 
[02:18:30]  She's crazy?  How do you not?  You know?  Yeah, it's sexy.  It's obvious.  Good for you.  I just want to get it.  I mean, let's be honest.  Come on, Efren.  You're talking to some professionals here.  You had sex with her, and then you made sure she wasn't going to call the authorities.  So hence, the breakfast and meeting the family.  No one meets the family.  If that was a fat male lunatic asleep in his underwear, would you have signed stuff and  took him for a little bite and then met his family?  Of course not.  Who do you think you're talking to here?  I pray on mental illness. 
[02:19:00]  I keep asking, well, what would Brando do?  He probably would have sent her to the Oscars to accept whatever he won.  Of course!  That is crazy, though, that she got into your room just like that.  You know?  I was thinking, you know, maybe I should...  Mind you, we were filming in Santa Fe as well as Albuquerque, so maybe they just had my  name.  They just figured it out.  As it is.  I'll pull it up a little bit.  That's nice.  Yeah.  So what do you play in Employee of the Month?  My character's name is Jorge, and I play Dax Shepard's, I would say, slave. 
[02:19:30]  You know, it's Dane Cook and Dax Shepard who not only are fighting to become the Employee  of the Month, but they're fighting for Jessica Simpson's love.  You know, and I'm best friends to Dax Shepard, and I help him out, try to figure out a way  to help him win the Employee of the Month and win Jessica's heart.  You know, but all the things that happen in this film, it's really funny.  You know, Greg Coolidge, who not only, I mean, he directed it, but he wrote it.  You know, and he's an actor himself, so he understood the characters.  And with an ensemble cast like Andy Dick and Sean Whelan, Tim Baxter, and then Danny Woodburn, 
[02:20:00]  I mean, these guys are really funny.  So, I mean, people always wonder about Jessica Simpson.  They're like, well, she's a musician.  She's not an actress.  But, you know, she, too, is an entertainer.  You know, and this role was written for her.  She plays a really sweet girl.  So wrapped around all these kooky, comedic character actors.  So, of course, it's going to work.  You know, I went to the premiere, and the film is really good.  Tell us something about Jessica Simpson we don't know.  Uh, she really knows how to bake cookies.  Really? 
[02:20:30]  She's a really good cook.  Does she eat her own boogers?  I don't know about that.  That would be interesting to find out.  That could add the flavor to the cookies, right?  That wouldn't bother me a bit.  I'd still make out with it with one glistening on her lip.  Well, I did play her little sister's boyfriend in a video.  You know, did it to her boyfriend.  And I thought, well, you know, would that be wrong if I played her little sister's boyfriend  and trying to hit up on Jessica?  No.  No, not at all.  Oh, well.  How old is her little sister?  Uh, I don't know. 
[02:21:00]  I just know as long as she's legal, that's fine.  Yeah.  Didn't something go on with Andy Dick on the set for that show?  Like, uh, didn't he, like, snap or lose it?  I mean, Andy Dick's, as we all know, Andy Dick's always Andy Dick.  You know, he's really wild and rambunctious, and I really love that guy.  You know, um, but working on the set, mind you, I think we're all delirious at some point  because, I mean, we're really shooting long hours, and it's about five o'clock in the  morning, and we're all, like, strung out in Red Bull and coffee.  So, and I know his, you know, Andy Dick's pretty wild, and, you know, there are moments 
[02:21:30]  when he was just nuts.  I would love, I know, I know he's probably, like, a friend of yours and stuff, but I  would love, like, as he's going crazy, like, and being all hyper and stuff, for someone  to just punch him in the face real hard, and watch him just get knocked out.  That would probably be the funniest thing ever to see Andy Dick do.  You know what, I actually saw, um, Grizzly Man when I was there.  Have you seen that documentary?  Yeah, I love it.  Wouldn't you love to see Andy Dick do a spoof on, you know, Grizzly Man?  He should do it on Instagram.  Hello, Mr. Chocolate! 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Mr. Chocolate!  Try on my speed owls!  Only if it ends the exact same way, with the guy getting eaten.  No spoof, just him and Steve C, nude in the woods.  Grizzly Man, did you think he wanted to commit suicide by bear?  I'm convinced that he...  I think that was his purpose in life.  I was convinced that, I saw that, I thought that movie was really, really interesting,  because he got so famous for doing this thing, and he was on Letterman and all that,  and then it started drying up, like, people were like,  alright, Grizzly Man, you're out in the woods with the bears again this summer. 
[02:22:30]  And they weren't paying as much attention to him, and I think he was completely nuts.  And he decided, you know what, I'm going to go out in a huge way here.  He decided that summer to stay later than he ever did, knowing the, quote,  friendlier Grizzly Bears were leaving that area, and then the more surly bears were coming into that same area.  He knew what he was getting himself into, and I'm convinced he wanted to go out by being mauled by a bear.  Honestly, I think his decision became emotionally based rather than well thought out.  And because of that, you know, he lost focus of what he wanted to do in the first place. 
[02:23:00]  But there was so much anger inside him already since, you know, since there's so many issues that he was dealing with.  And, you know, they were finally coming out, especially when he was, you know, all by himself out in the woods, you know.  And he tried to connect with something, you know.  If it wasn't himself, then it was with the bears.  And the bears, you know, mind you, it's a flipping bear, yo.  It's going to eat you up.  It's not Winnie the Pooh.  Right.  So, you know, it happened.  They're telling us you have to go. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, man.  We're going to take a break and wrap up the Opie and Anthony show, but let's get some plugs in.  Can you do it as Pedro, please?  Dude, anything for you guys.  And I'll tell you guys this for the rest of my life.  No matter how many films I do, you guys will be family for the rest of my life.  See?  Yeah?  I think we hit a nerve.  Yeah?  Because we brought him in on such a personal thing.  Yeah.  Now we're family.  If you see him in 20 years, what radio show?  The guy who was on the phone with the mental hospital?  Oh, yes.  I do remember that.  It's employee of the month. 
[02:24:00]  And I got to tell you, I just signed contracts to do Revenge of the Nerds.  No.  Yeah.  They're remaking it?  They're remaking it.  Oh, nice.  They're going to be perfect for that movie.  Are you what's the role you're doing?  My character's name is Santiago.  I'm a foreign exchange student from Spain.  Are they rewriting it or are they remaking it?  They're remaking it, but it has like a different ending.  Updated.  They're updating it with the new technology that's out there.  Yeah.  I'd hate to see him play that same song that they played.  Right, right.  Yeah, right.  It's a little dated.  Yeah, but the script is really good, guys.  I'm really excited to do this project. 
[02:24:30]  Vote for Pedro?  Or something.  Are you happy to have a white family now?  That word.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's like...  Oh, wait.  You guys are white?  What, Rich?  What?  I don't know what you mean.  Try the wine.  This is his family now.  He's walking here.  He's walking.  Where are you going?  In the bathroom.  Yeah, he knows he's bombing.  All right.  Efren, it was a pleasure.  Efren Ramirez from Employee of the Month.  It's my pleasure meeting you guys.  All right.  We're going to wrap up this mess next. 
[02:25:00]  Wait, we got to plug Employee of the Month.  We did.  Oh, okay.  What movie are we plugging?  Open Friday Wide.  With Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson and yourself.  And who else is in it?  Dax Shepard, Sean Whalen, Danny Woodburn, Tim Bagley, and Andy Dick.  This Friday.  Oh, and he also likes banging stalkers.  Sleeping lunatics.  Yeah.  Poking.  Poking.  Poking.  Yeah.  They can all find me on MySpace.com slash Efren Ramirez.  Hold on.  Roland has something.  Roland what?  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Yes.  The movie's out October 6th. 
[02:25:30]  Why?  Oh.  Why?  What's out October 6th?  All right.  A week from Friday.  What's out October 6th?  Can we just leave the show?  Play of the Month.  I also have Crank, right?  Crank.  Yeah.  All right.  The wheels are falling off.  Efren, thank you.  Efren Ramirez.  We're trying to figure out what to do.  It's been a crazy morning.  Should we just leave?  Uh-oh.  Phone called off.  Oh, is that me?  Phone call.  That wasn't me.  That was me.  Who was that?  That was me.  I'm sorry.  Oh, go ahead.  Yell at that doctor.  Doctor?  No, it's my girlfriend. 
[02:26:00]  Oh.  She was listening to the show.  You told me you didn't poke her.  Uh-oh.  Or it's actually her.  I'm sorry.  I met this guy.  I was DJing in Milwaukee.  Yeah.  In a club called Cairns.  And this girl, just like, just my, I mean, she's the one, you know, and she's really beautiful  and she's a heart attack and her name is Romina.  So, um, she's, she's it.  Wait, I thought, I thought you and, oh, your problem is this, okay. 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  I'll call you in about five minutes, okay?  I'm just, I'm just letting it, I'm letting the world know how much I'm in love with you.  That's some explaining to do.  Bye.  Is that the one you met on the, sleeping on the bed?  No.  If you dated her, I'd just, I would just, hold on.  Okay.  Why don't we just wrap up the show, okay?  Let's do that.  All right.  We're going to continue over at XM Satellite Radio.  Efren Ramirez, thank you.  I want to get a quick shot if that's okay.  Of course.  October 6th, employee of the month premieres. 
[02:27:00]  Yes.  It's a week from tomorrow, Friday.  It was a, it was a messed up day.  It's, it looks like it's working out for him.  Well, I hope so.  We'll know at 1130, uh, if everything goes as promised.  Well, no one's going to know because you're going to leave, so we'll get the update tomorrow,  I guess.  All right, uh, guys, thank you so much.  Someone's going to call me and let me know about the update.  Yes.  I mean, I'm a part of this now.  You'll know, Roland, how to, yeah.  Okay.  That would be great.  Now you'll know.  And thanks to JV and Elvis here in New York for letting us go a little late.  Yes, thank you, guys.  But it was just a crazy morning.  So, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[02:27:30]  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Ah.  Ant's on the phone.  We're walking down the sidewalk.  The whole thing happened again.  O.P., you're way ahead of me.  I know.  Where are you, Jimmy?  I'm back here, and I'm scared.  Let me hold your hand.  I'm frightened.  I'm carrying my signed gloves.  Oh, you want to be?  Are you a man? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I lost Bonnie.  What's that?  I lost Bonnie.  Get used to saying that.  I know.  Hold on.  I don't need headphones.  Do I need them?  Yeah.  You don't need a mic either.  Jesus.  Stupid.  Only Vos.  Today, like, was one of those shows for the ages where it was really all about Anthony getting  deeply, deeply personal.  Probably more personal than any one of us on the show.  And just one of those unique shows. 
[02:28:30]  And in the elevator, there's Vos going, ah, wasn't funny today.  I'm back.  Hold on.  Let me just correct Opie.  More personal than anybody on the show, I confessed to blowing people when I was a boy.  Yeah, but that's hot.  You're right.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you were a young lad.  Oh, we're...  Hey, Ant.  I'm back.  Everything good?  I just got off the phone.  There you go.  Yeah.  No, but see, during times...  There is a...  During times, you're depressed.  Boss, I don't want you to explain.  No, Rich, what are you saying?  The point is, it's not about you today. 
[02:29:00]  I don't give a shit.  Oh.  Okay.  Hey, Rich, what were you saying?  I was just trying to add and try to lighten it up.  Oh, Rich was critiquing his appearance again.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, Rich, what were you saying?  It was so much...  Ant, can I read the email, the feedback that I wanted to read, but I was too scared because  it looked like you were going to kill me?  Oh, boy.  A lot of listeners want to know which child hospital she was at.  Which children's hospital.  People are a bunch of smartasses. 
[02:29:30]  In the middle of your...  My tirade.  Watch your feet.  Watch your feet.  They're like, we want to help.  Which children's hospital is she in?  Bunch of asses.  Gotta love them.  What time are you leaving, sweetie pie?  Let's see.  Well, if I have to be in a meeting by 1130, let me look at my watch that I forgot.  Oh, look at mine.  Look at mine.  I left my wallet.  I have to go home first to get my wallet, which I left at home.  I left in a tizzy this morning. 
[02:30:00]  And you know what it's like to do 90 miles an hour and then find out you were doing that  without any of your PBA cards and your license?  I would have been in the joint in a second if I got pulled over.  I think it's funny that we're on XM and the first unusual word you've used is tizzy.  Yes.  Yeah, no kidding.  Okay.  Fucking tizzy.  Wow.  Who's the name?  Oh, I know.  I cursed more on FM than I have so far.  You did fuck, motherfucker, and you dropped a C-bomb.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  And justifiably so.  Making Al work today.  Holy shit.  Nice hairdo.  Hold on.  Yes?  Exploitation.  Sean Lennon has a new CD and DVD coming out October 3rd.  Guess what the name of it is.  Where's my dad's head?  Might as well be.  The name of the CD and DVD, Friendly Fire.  Holy...  Where is that?  Right there, the pink one.  Oh.  Sean Lennon's new CD and DVD is called Friendly Fire.  Well, the original time I had to be changed, it was on the half of what? 
[02:31:00]  Another waste of a CD.  That guy is so talented, but just listened to his mommy way too much growing up.  His voice is just like John Lennon's.  Just like John Lennon's when he sings.  Yeah.  But it's all artsy, artsy crap.  Some people will buy it.  Hello?  I don't make any...  Don't talk badly of anybody walking in.  No, we're not allowed to.  I don't get in trouble.  Where is that Asian gentleman? 
[02:31:30]  I want to see that fucking tattletale.  A tattletale.  We've been waiting for him for three days now.  They're blocking the entrance.  Is that him?  Oh, no.  No, you'll never know.  You'll never know.  Could have been.  You couldn't tell if he was laughing out loud or tattling.  All right, let's go upstairs.  Tattling.  All right.  Well, I just want to make sure Jimmy treats the man with respect.  Dude, this place has turned into a medical facility.  What?  Because this is like a Jewish center.  Why? 
[02:32:00]  Look at it.  What happened was they had a big thing where they were doing a lot of circumcisions.  And there was a bag of foreskins that somebody actually emptied behind that counter.  And I don't know.  Their tie must have fallen onto it.  So there's a pile of foreskins with a tie on them.  A pile of foreskins.  And there's just a little tuft of hair on it.  So one of those boys was very mature.  Just a pile of meaty, sweaty foreskins.  With a...  Oh, look at them waving at people.  How does it wave?  Drop something.  All right, now say hi. 
[02:32:30]  Be nice.  All right.  We'll all be nice.  Morning, sir.  You're a chimp.  You're a baboon.  Good morning.  Ape, baboon, monkey.  Chimp, ape, baboon.  I'll see you upstairs.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that.  No woman.  And every other kind of defeat.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay...  Huh?  ...weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of defeat. 
[02:33:00]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.P. and Anthony program.  God, that irritates me!  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[02:33:30]  O.P.  I want my coffee!  Anthony!  I want that fact!  Jim Norton!  I want Ozzy!  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  We will be an Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  We'll be right back. 
[02:34:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:34:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:35:00]  All right. 
[02:35:30]  We've got the funniest elevator ride scene ever took place in there.  I don't know if, uh, was tape rolling on that one?  On the camera?  Yeah?  God damn.  Loudest fart ever in the elevator with other passengers on there.  And then all of us trying not to laugh until one person went just, and then all of us just 
[02:36:00]  couldn't control, uh, laughing.  Did you hear it?  The fart?  It was so fucking loud.  It was so fucking loud.  It, total silence, and then the loudest fart I ever heard him do on an elevator with people  on it.  It's amazing.  I felt that one.  I was like, I was trying to get one brewing before I walk in.  And that one, it was like, it was like a gift from heaven.  I felt nothing.  And all of a sudden I felt a rolling rumble that stopped right over my colon.  And I'm like, this couldn't be better.  And we get on, I go to rest. 
[02:36:30]  I just go.  I just, nothing could spoil that moment.  It was like, yeah.  It was like Ollie watching fucking Foreman Fall.  You didn't want to do anything clumsy.  You just wanted it to happen.  Just let it happen.  Didn't want anyone stepping on it with some stupid, dude.  Press five.  Yeah.  It was total silence.  And then like a loud, clean crackle.  All right.  Congratulations.  You're kidding me.  We'll get to video.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  You hear that?  We'll get it now.  Oh, Kenny, we have some soup.  What do we got?  Oh.  I haven't eaten in like two days.  Oh, you get some soup for the boss.  I still can't eat.  I can't eat until this is taken care of.  I'm one of those people that like in crisis can't eat.  Really?  Yeah.  Some people should just shove food in their mouth.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this crisis is just eating.  When I'm in crisis, I throw a party.  You have a little party? 
[02:37:30]  I throw a little party.  No, I don't.  I'll eat later.  Can we get the dump report, please?  Wow.  That's got to be a biggie today.  We haven't done the dump report in a while, but...  Gee, I wonder who won today.  It's going to be a Lulu.  But it might be interesting to go over today.  Also, thank you, FullBlownAids.com.  Thank you.  I got my t-shirt, finally.  Where's mine?  No.  I'll be.  Full-blown age t-shirt.  I wonder if they're trying to get the...  Oh, I took a boner pill.  Oh, I took a boner pill.  Cool.  I took a boner pill t-shirt. 
[02:38:00]  Lovely.  What kind of soup do you got?  Manhattan Clam.  FullBlownAids.com.  Thank you.  Turkey chili or five bean.  Manhattan Clam is not that bad.  Hey, what's up with the Manhattan Clam?  Manhattan Clam Chuck.  Clam.  To De La Hoya?  Oh.  Anthony Caller.  Anthony.  Wow.  Oscar De La Hoya.  Caller.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  What happened?  Here is today's dump report.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:38:30]  Well, can we have a club sort of Kenny read off the dumps today?  Oh, okay.  In his retard voice.  That'd be fun.  Oh, but that's mean spirit.  Girls.  It's like Kenny that way.  Yeah, but girls seem to enjoy his voice.  Kenny.  Here you go.  Here you go, Kenny.  You got it?  Yeah.  So you do the time and then what the dump was, okay?  And who did the dump? 
[02:39:00]  This is your dump report today, folks.  At 074 hours.  Oh, my God.  He needs his reading glasses.  Should I put him on?  Yeah.  Yeah, put him on.  No, I want to hear him try it without it.  Can you try it without it?  He can see, but it's funnier to see him.  He's doing his reading glasses.  You can read it?  Yeah.  All right, but throw your reading glasses on.  Yeah, put your glasses on then so we can see how funny you look with them.  Look at...  Look at...  Oh, look.  I'm Clark Kent. 
[02:39:30]  Clark Kent.  Wow, handsome.  Thanks.  Man of steel wool hair.  Clark.  Clark.  It does.  It gives you a totally different look.  Yeah, like an old lady.  He's fucking knitting a shawl.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thanks.  I love the negative attention.  7.04 a.m.  From Anthony.  Thanks, sir.  I swear I'll just fucking leave.  All right.  Thank you.  7.28 a.m. 
[02:40:00]  A caller.  Jimmy, shut the fuck up.  Caller was rude.  He certainly was.  7.34 a.m.  From Anthony.  Amy, you cunt.  Amy, you're a cunt.  Why'd they dump that?  I know.  That was kind of in the gray area.  7.53 a.m.  From the champ, Oscar De La Hoya.  Holy shit.  8.07 a.m.  From a caller.  You get to say fuck, cunt. 
[02:40:30]  8.33 a.m.  From Anthony.  I am fucking livid.  Anthony on the phone with the hospital.  Mm-hmm.  8.34 a.m.  Anthony, give me bullshit answers.  8.38 a.m.  Anthony once again.  The medical community is a bunch of fuckos.  Yeah.  Probably the toughest one out of the whole bunch of dumps.  The fuckos line. 
[02:41:00]  We haven't done yet.  Wow.  Don't you have a song to sing?  Oh.  Does he?  Mm-hmm.  Any requests?  Same one.  Okay.  Ready?  With a little enthusiasm today.  Oh, and a one, and a two, and a three.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  To everyone he meets, he stays a stranger. 
[02:41:30]  Mixing it up.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Secret agent man.  Secret agent man.  They're giving you a number and taking away your name.  Way.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Way.  And he doesn't say away.  They're taking away.  He says taking away.  Taking away.  There's an apostrophe before the W. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, of course there is.  It's like you can see the ball bouncing.  Yeah.  Taking away.  And the ball would bounce higher on way.  So you know how to sing it properly.  Emily, I just started listening 20 minutes ago.  What the F happened?  Bert and Philly.  Wow.  You picked the wrong day to sleep in.  Picked the wrong day to sleep in.  Get XM and yeah.  I'll take this one, Anthony.  Hey, by the way, the video of Club Soda Kenny singing Secret Agent Man is up on YouTube as we speak. 
[02:42:30]  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  That's a good one.  Also up there, intern Craig sucks Big Ronda's herniated belly button.  Big Ronda makes Bob Kelly puke.  Most of the Fatty Pick Fatty videos are now up on YouTube.  Voss doing comedy from a diner in Cleveland.  Now up on YouTube for you to do.  Classic moment.  Again, killing in a place that should not even have.  A comedian should just be killed in the place, not be killing.  And I don't know why you do so well in those places. 
[02:43:00]  Because he's used to working black rooms where he's like.  It's actually better.  Yeah, these are actually easier crowds than the fucking racial hatred he's had to face and overcome.  20 years in those awful rooms.  Yeah, you still want egg whites?  No, I'm right.  What?  You still want egg whites?  Huh?  What?  Egg whites.  You still want egg whites?  Everyone's eating soup.  I want a low-fat yogurt.  Okay.  Yogurt.  Oh, no. 
[02:43:30]  Is that me?  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Please, please, please tell me they're calling to say just kidding.  If I, yeah, right?  No, right.  What?  Oh.  Why?  Thank you.  I got your text.  Thank you.  Okay.  Everything's good.  That's Dr. Steve checking in. 
[02:44:00]  Hmm.  Asking if, you know, anything he can do.  Thank you.  Very good.  Yeah.  Actually, I'm getting a little antsy about the time.  I don't blame you.  Because I got it.  If I could.  Get somebody to get your car right now.  If I could just go right there, I'd be fine.  Someone get your car.  Oh.  Poe.  Poe.  Misoire.  Masture.  Poe.  Could you please pull the car around, sir? 
[02:44:30]  And have it pointing in the proper direction on the other side of the street, the south  side of, thank you, sir.  Go.  All right.  You are the man.  Let's go to Kevin in Arizona.  Kevin.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I like when Kenny goes, tomorrow.  But the line of the day, I'm nominating Jimmy.  When that bitch was on the phone, and she said the show was starting to not be funny,  Oak goes, why don't you listen to something else? 
[02:45:00]  And Jimmy goes, yeah, like your cousin was listening to, a bullet wheezing in.  Yeah.  I don't know, sir.  I'm feeling pretty confident about line of the day today.  I don't like that type of car.  If I had to take bets, it's still early on.  I'm feeling good.  And, you know, one horse is being scratched from the race.  Taking myself out here.  No, you're not.  I am.  You got some lines in.  No, but I mean, as far as line of the day so far.  No asterisk today.  I would put my money on Opie.  But, no, the stat will have an asterisk on it. 
[02:45:30]  No, I want a complete victory.  The stat's going to have an asterisk on it.  I don't want one of these lame victories.  You're Opie Marish.  It's going to have to be.  I don't want a lame victory.  Opie, line of the day.  And then asterisk, you look at the bottom and go, Anthony left the show at about a quarter to ten.  I don't want to have one of those dumb baseball records where you did the record before blacks were allowed to play.  I want this to count.  It doesn't make the stat any less of what it is, Opie. 
[02:46:00]  It was a funny, very funny line.  I don't think it'll be beat today.  I think it's very good.  Yeah, but people are going to go, well, yeah, he won, but he didn't really win because Ant wasn't there.  No one will say that.  I will.  I will.  He will, but no one else.  But don't you.  Man.  Can Kenny sing Metallica?  Maybe.  Everyone is saying that Kenny needs to read the dump report every day now.  It is kind of funny.  Yeah.  He puts emotion into it. 
[02:46:30]  I like that.  Oh, wait, you're getting in the car, so you've got a few more minutes.  We've got to get Jimmy's fart on the radio before you leave.  Yes, I want to hear that because we were all chuckling.  And we missed a lot of good stuff today.  How's the soup today?  Good.  Want some?  Good night.  Everything's going to work out?  She's getting out, dude?  And I can't until it's all done.  It'd be funny if the minute you got in the truck, you started screaming about the wine  spill.  Oh, my God.  Can I tell you something?  Oh, my God.  Thank God that's over. 
[02:47:00]  So we can get back into it.  It really matters.  Awful.  Today, I realize that I'm not as brave as I'd like to think, and I would like other people  to think.  I wanted to play.  UB 40s red wine.  Red wine.  Red, red wine.  Yeah.  That part isn't so bad because I realized it was the dumbest argument.  Hold on.  Yo, JV and Elvis are trashing you for treating them like second-class citizens.  They think your interview was stupid and that they are thinking of leaving.  In voice of Opie.  You have less listeners. 
[02:47:30]  I've heard rumor.  I haven't heard anything.  What's going on, sir?  What?  We have audio coming.  All right.  Get some audio.  Get them on the phone.  Get them on the phone.  I'll call from the Escalade.  This is very controversial.  Because I want to be part of that.  You know, you've got to add a half an hour at the hospital for them to find a wheelchair  lady because they have to wheel them out.  You know, they won't let them walk out of a hospital.  Yeah, you watch.  You watch.  I'll dress like the wheelchair lady and we'll be out of there. 
[02:48:00]  Believe me.  One way or another.  I love sitting in the studio and just sitting in front of a...  A swastika.  And by the way, we could have done an extra half hour.  We only did 15 minutes.  We didn't stretch and hog up the time.  Dude, it was a very interesting show.  I understand that today was compelling radio, which got us all backed up as far as taking  breaks and stuff.  And we had no choice but to go late.  I don't know what to tell you.  Go back to San Francisco.  Where the hell are you from?  Well, let's hear what they said. 
[02:48:30]  Maybe the listeners exaggerate sometimes.  We could have a guest we didn't want to blow off because the guest was very cool.  That's why I like confirming it by hearing the audio first, getting multiple accurate  reports.  I don't like one person bad mouth because they usually get it wrong.  You ever hear someone try to describe something from this show to you?  Remember that when you were doing it?  I think you could go, no, I have no recollection because your description of it sucks.  So maybe they don't know.  Let's see.  But let me just say, if this is true and they're right, I will have a lot of fun. 
[02:49:00]  Because I am not in the best of moods.  The reality is the company wants us to take that fourth hour anyway.  It's our hour.  Oh, here we go.  It is our hour.  That's not bad talking about it.  We could go as long as we want every single day.  Ladies and gentlemen, Opie is being loaded into gate eight.  Gate eight.  Place your bets.  They're online and they're off. 
[02:49:30]  There's no holding him back.  Let's see what they said.  Just make sure it's not.  I've seen that.  I remember the of 94.  Trust me, I love it.  I love a good fight.  This is like.  Let's just see what happened first.  A couple of these.  I say we hold our horses until we know what went on.  Whoa.  Because sometimes inflection is different.  Someone says something in a joking way.  Like the listener tried that time with Tess.  Who was the comedian, the fat chick that they tried to say that they were blaming us? 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  But when they were blaming us, it was funny.  And it wasn't.  They were blaming us in a very funny way.  Fast Freddy, who's pretty reliable.  All Fast Freddy, all right.  Elvis and douchefuck want to be treated as equals, as they say.  Did he get a new partner?  Because I thought.  Yeah, he's very funny.  They're crying at Free FM.  Can someone let them know they are the swing guys?  Not drive.  Whatever that means.  Stop acting like you're important.  Oh, boy.  How long until we get the audio?  Thank you.  How long? 
[02:50:30]  Time check.  Probably when they break.  What?  When they break.  I think so, yeah.  And by they, you mean me.  They're bitching about us right now?  No, I'm just saying that's when we'll be able to get the CD.  Oh, just in case they say anything else?  Or when we break.  Were you saying they like?  Yeah, why can't we just get now?  Someone's over there waiting for them to stop the recording.  And then we're going to bring her over.  Okay.  I'll listen to them.  This is why we're different than every other radio show out there.  Uh, okay.  This, everyone's commenting about.  Half-time show, uh, Daisy Chains? 
[02:51:00]  No, everyone is commenting about what happened this morning.  This morning was great radio because we care about you guys.  Great call going with it.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I got to tell you, Kevin, we had no choice.  Ant decided he was, he couldn't just sit around at home and wait around.  And he needed to just, you know, kind of a distraction.  So he came in to do the show.  We're sitting in the office and there's some great stuff today.  Like, uh, Screech doing a sex tape with a dirty Sanchez and all that.  And we're like going over this material going, well, we could, we certainly could do a show.  And then it was so obvious in the office, uh, from five to six that it had to go with this. 
[02:51:30]  I knew I wanted to go with this.  It wasn't my decision.  It was, it was really up to him.  I knew I couldn't come in and do a fake fun, like, Hey, let's talk about Screech or something.  I could, my mind is too preoccupied.  The only reason I came in is because I am incommunicado with so many people at the hospital, including, uh, uh, my girlfriend.  So I, I couldn't talk.  So why, why not come in here?  I mean, I'm going to sit at home and, and mope around the house or come in here and actually, for selfish reasons, put it on the radio and maybe get some results. 
[02:52:00]  Which, and it did, could have happened.  I don't know.  And then you got these guys over there.  I don't know what's going on to be fair, but the reports are saying they're bitching because we went late.  If you don't understand why we went late today, then you really don't understand radio.  The midday show over at, uh, our FM affiliate in New York city.  We probably gave them three to four times the audience because we went late.  Because no one was touching their radio dial this morning. 
[02:52:30]  That's just how radio works.  So we gave them a massive, massive cume today as they started their show.  So a lot more people are checking them out today than would on a regular day.  If they don't get that, I don't know what to tell you.  Let's get an accurate audio.  I want it transcribed.  I want it emailed to me in triplicate.  They do that anymore?  In triplicate.  Just send it three times.  And I want JVs in blue and I want Elvis's in red so I can easily discern.  Oh, good news.  Fast Friday.  Double space.  Fast Friday and update. 
[02:53:00]  They stopped a few minutes ago.  Now they're talking about the best veggies to jam in your ass while sucking a cock.  Carrots.  Yeah.  Doesn't it start and end with carrots?  Well, a cucumber, a lot of our people.  What is this, hawk?  You've got to be a pretty big person for it.  If they sent...  No!  Take that package back.  What is it?  If they sent you a shirt too, that's not fair.  I wanted to be the late show kid.  Jimmy turned out to be the late show kid.  So now we're both the late show kid. 
[02:53:30]  But he's late show kid with two Ds, which is cooler than late show kid with one D.  And now I'm thinking he's going to have the same t-shirt that I just opened up,  which is a unique t-shirt that I want to wear exclusively.  Me, me, me.  Wait, here's the thing.  No, mine's white.  It's white.  It's white.  Superior.  Just because it's smarter doesn't mean it's going to look better.  And where is my I took a boner pill t-shirt?  It can.  Oh, look at...  Wow.  Mine's better. 
[02:54:00]  Mine's better.  Let me see.  I just took a boner pill in big black obnoxious letters.  It's all big.  Everyone can see that from across the room.  And across the red.  I hate you.  Why?  I took a boner pill.  I don't want to be a twin anymore.  You're not.  I want to be an individual.  Here.  My car.  Anybody else want to wear these?  Let's all wear our boner pills.  Let's be a gang. 
[02:54:30]  We're the faggots.  Get out of our way.  I want to know when my car's here immediately.  Somebody get the car, man.  I need to know immediately.  You know what?  Have an intern stand by the window, and that's his whole job.  Intern Nosferatu.  That way he can fly up to the window and signal me.  If someone sees a bat winking at the window, please tell me.  No, it's daylight.  You're going to say, is my truck here?  And look over, and there's going to be a pile of rubble and ash. 
[02:55:00]  Just ash and clothes.  That intern is good, that Nosferatu.  He got this glove in three minutes.  Yeah.  He fucking flew over here.  Could someone call JV and Elvis and ask them to call our show so we can discuss this?  I guess E-Rock's been calling and what?  We have all the hotlines, right?  Yeah, but they won't take the phone call.  Have you been listening live?  Inside?  We're trying to.  They're complaining about not being on the air back in their hometown of San Francisco  while doing New York as well.  But Travis has been trying to get him on the phone. 
[02:55:30]  They won't take the phone call.  Are they answering who it is?  The call screener knows damn well who it is, and he won't put the phone call through.  Well, at least he's putting it through.  Comfortable in the hallway in the morning.  What's the call screener saying?  When they pass by.  They're explaining, no, we're not trashing you, that none of that's going on,  and then they're not putting the phone call through.  Okay.  It's pretty simple.  But if there was any trashing going on about us running long, I want to hear that,  because that is trashing of us.  We're getting the audio.  You know. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  Well, we'll just sit here and wait.  Technically, they run long every day from the 9 to 10 o'clock hour.  You know.  Technically.  Technically.  I'm talking logistics here, my friend.  All right.  Let's get into the screech before Anthony's car gets here.  Did they show video of him?  I heard Dustin Diamond has a huge cock.  They're going to be.  He does.  Supposedly.  Oh, I mean.  Hence the cucumber.  Wow.  Answer.  What?  She said.  Cucumber, for what you should put up your ass.  Oh, nice.  And a lot of people were surprised, but now it makes sense. 
[02:56:30]  Where's Voss?  Because Dustin Diamond has a huge cock, and it looks like.  Voss just left.  Never mind.  Why does he just walk out?  What's wrong with him?  He's amazing.  Rich, where'd you go?  He's fascinating.  I said, Rich, where'd you go?  It was Sam.  All right.  Is that already?  What?  No.  Oh.  Jimmy Farts.  Yes.  Oh, good.  Let's hear that in the elevator.  All right.  That was a fun one.  God, I wish I'd been there.  Oh, the moment.  Oh.  Can you hear it on this, Sam?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then us laughing, trying not to laugh.  God, it was just as good as my elevator ride.  You guys are having all this hilarity, and I'm discussing with Bonnie that Rich Voss' DVD  looks cool because it has a picture of him on the front now instead of just a black cover  with the word Voss in white letters on it.  That was my exciting elevator ride.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I didn't fart for you.  This was hot.  I had a cucumber and everything.  I was just kidding. 
[02:57:30]  Let's just go.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Three. 
[02:58:00]  Three.  Two.  Three.  Eight.  Four.  Three.  Four.  Four.  Over the door.  Four. 
[02:58:30]  It did a stink.  How come no one wanted to laugh?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There were two girls on the other day with us.  Yeah, everyone hides.  But the laughs slowly build, and then they couldn't help themselves anymore.  There was an Asian woman who had the worst ass I've ever seen,  and then there was another lady who was going up the floor higher.  Stan, what were those ladies' faces like?  No, I was going to say, and the whole time I was looking over,  and the ladies were just watching us shaking and looking down, 
[02:59:00]  obviously laughing.  Yeah.  It was very embarrassing.  It looked like either we were all Michael J. Fox impersonators  or trying not to laugh.  That was a damn good one.  What reverberation that had.  Yeah, in an elevator.  What balls.  It was potent.  It didn't really stink, though.  It was just loud.  That sounds like a trumpet.  That's the actual fart.  It sounds fake.  That's good.  I think it's the Doppler of the moving elevator and the fart. 
[02:59:30]  For those of you that understand the Doppler.  That was a nice fart.  Yeah.  Sounds like you got a tight a-hole.  I do.  Oh.  I do.  It's got a four-finger maximum.  That's like when you order a drink and you ask for two fingers, you know.  Oh, sure shot.  Yeah.  Where did Vos go?  Where's Rich?  He's doing a phoner.  He's doing a phoner.  He's doing a phoner.  Where is he? 
[03:00:00]  Well, who?  It's getting much later than I expected.  Yeah, but.  I'm going downstairs.  But he's.  Then right when it pulls up, I'm gone.  I have to.  I'll call.  I'll call from the road.  I used to have the hotline in my old phone before.  Boring.  Somebody write that down.  Give your girlfriend the best.  Who hit that?  I will.  Who hit boring?  Who the fuck hit the boring button?  Honestly, no one hit that button.  Oh, his head.  Hey, you can't have the boring sound clip.  That was mine.  Oh, you hit it, Ant, when you threw.  Boring.  You did.  You threw.  Boring.  That was my. 
[03:00:30]  Boring.  That was my exclusive sound clip.  Hey, I'm leaving.  Boring.  Dude, that was mine.  Somehow it got mine.  I don't have try the wine or any of the Steve clips.  That was my clip.  I don't have any clips.  I have no mercy for one of you.  Feel free to use mine today.  Oh, I can't.  My hands are sticky.  Good luck, dude.  I'm going to call you at 1135.  I'll call you from the road.  Yeah, please call.  Yeah, call in, please.  I will.  I will.  But.  Bye, sweetie. 
[03:01:00]  But that was.  Well, you know, you got to share.  Nice to everyone has a clip.  What if you're not in the room and something happens?  Then there's no boring clip.  But it has to be.  It has to exist.  That was a good show.  If I'm not in the room, then there's no boring clips.  See, because I'm brilliant.  Should we have Ant call from the sidewalk?  And Rich is doing an interview?  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and we'll regroup.  We will regroup. 
[03:01:30]  I can't believe early anyway because I have a flight to catch.  I'm going to Cuba.  You are allowed to stay till 11, I heard.  I probably could, but I have to finish packing.  1050?  No.  You're so irresponsible.  I don't know.  Sick.  No.  My clothes, I took them to the dry clear.  They won't be ready until this morning.  They weren't back yesterday.  All right.  Well, maybe you should take them a day early.  Oh, I don't know.  All right.  We're going to break.  Voss should be back in studio by the time we get back.  I hope so.  Bonnie will definitely be here.  Ant might be on the phone. 
[03:02:00]  Ant might be on the phone.  And we're thinking the Voss and Bonnie show today.  Yeah.  Yes, no, maybe so.  Sorry.  No, you guys are good together.  Yeah, all right.  You guys had a good show the last time.  I got a couple of rich stories to tell.  Someone has to get us to noon today.  Just don't make fun of them.  All right.  We'll be back.  Toby and Lonnie.  This is unpredictable radio.  Holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry. 
[03:02:30]  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man, and I'm being yelled at.  You're idiots.  All right.  We're back with the Opie show.  Opie and friends.  It's all about me. 
[03:03:00]  The evil genius is broadcasting solo.  No, you're not.  You got a room full of people here.  You got Richard and Jim and Fan and Bonnie and Sam and Travis and Danny.  I'm sorry.  I got a little excited.  A little excited.  We're trying to get Anthony on his car phone, right?  Yes.  And we also have a director outside or an author.  Yeah.  Did he write the MIT book? 
[03:03:30]  Bringing Down the House, I think it was called?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a great.  Oh, he did.  Okay.  That was a great book.  I actually read that.  I did read some of that.  And we got E-Rock.  He's getting some audio from JV and Elvis.  They follow us after our free FM show in New York, and they're very pissed off that we went  late or something.  We're trying to get to the bottom of it.  But we gave the people some compelling radio today.  And if they don't understand that, I don't know what to tell you.  It was like we just decided off the cuff to go late today. 
[03:04:00]  It was one of those crazy shows.  No one was changing the dial whatsoever.  All the websites are being slammed right now.  Everyone's talking about it.  And it's on his way to a hospital to get his girlfriend out.  And people want to know what the hell happened.  It was one of those things that we can't reproduce.  And that friend had been very patient.  And he came in.  He just got it.  He didn't bitch and moan.  So we didn't want to douche the guy and not interview him.  Well, what they're saying?  They're like, well, you guys could have brought him over to X7 and interviewed him.  No, he's a big fucking Hollywood star.  And he was in the building with a publicist. 
[03:04:30]  And they have things to do.  So we figured it would be no big deal to just interview the guy really fast for 15 minutes  and go a little late today.  You were so backed up.  You only got Oscar De La Hoya in for like seven minutes when he was here.  That was a bummer.  I had no idea that would be such a great interview.  Yeah, any champion's going to be interesting.  They get punched in the face for a living.  Right.  All right, what do we got?  Anthony, give us a call.  We got the audio.  How long is this, E-Rock?  Four and a half minutes.  And what are they trying to say?  Ah, I tested you and you passed. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I'm not going over there.  You couldn't want to answer Mike.  No one touches Anthony's mic.  They start their show saying, yeah, that interview was worth starting at 9.30.  And they just kept saying, yeah, that interview was riveting.  Pretty much trashing the whole Efron thing.  Do we have that part of this?  That's the whole thing right in there.  How do you get the whole show?  We're good.  Fair enough.  Are you spying on people?  Fair enough.  Maybe.  Okay, so we got that.  We got that part. 
[03:05:30]  Then they backpedal saying, no, we love the guys, but we hate the management.  And the management was telling them, no, something's going on with Anthony's girlfriend.  This is good radio.  We have to let it go.  Plus, they have the guest.  So they thought they were going to hear more about Anthony's girlfriend.  But when they heard Efron come on, that's when they got upset.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, it wasn't a bit that was scripted.  It just so happened, right after we said we're going to go late, Anthony got a phone call  that everything was taken care of.  But we still had another commercial break to do. 
[03:06:00]  And we didn't want to do the guest.  And the guy was sitting there for an hour.  He waited with us.  He walked in in the middle of it.  Why are we explaining?  Everybody knows what happened.  Can we get Anthony or no?  Who's Anthony?  Bonnie said that, Anthony.  Bonnie.  No, because he said it was the Opie show.  You know how many guns he has at home?  I was just trying to be funny.  I really didn't mean any.  Is he still outside or has he got in his truck?  He should be in his truck.  He should be calling.  Do we have his new cell phone number? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, I'll give it to you right now.  I can't hear you, Travis.  He's calling right back.  Oh, he's calling us right back?  Oh, okay.  Does he have a new cell number?  I don't know.  I'm sweet on him.  He broke the other one.  I knew something was up when he told me Monday.  He emailed me or something.  And he said, I'm not going to have a cell phone for a while.  So I'll keep in touch through email.  And I'm like, oh, man, what happened?  I wasn't thinking like, oops, I dropped it in a bottle.  You know, I knew something was up.  Come on, Ant.  I don't want to play this audio until we get Anna on the phone. 
[03:07:00]  Where's Anthony?  Why are you still eating blueberries?  They're awful.  I can't eat them.  No, I haven't called it yet.  Season is still on.  I'm going to call blueberry season soon, though.  Do you watch them and eat them?  No, no, no.  For real?  Yeah.  He's on the line.  Go ahead, Rich.  Get your dumb plug in.  No, I was going to give this to you.  It's for you guys.  It's not me.  It's got the Opie and Anthony name on it now.  I was going to give this to you.  But look at the side of it. 
[03:07:30]  Read the side.  Voss from NBC is the last comic standing.  The last comic.  The last comic standing and the Opie and Anthony show.  That's nice, Rich.  Thanks.  Oh, but it fell on the floor.  Oh.  I tried to throw it on this counter here.  Anthony.  Hello.  Am I on the air?  You're on the radio, sir.  Turn your radio down.  Hello?  Hello?  All right.  Go ahead.  It's all about you.  You talk. 
[03:08:00]  Go ahead.  We'll listen.  Anthony.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Where are you?  I just got off the Queensborough Bridge.  Oh, okay.  You're making good time.  You want to hear this audio?  Yeah, let me hear this shit.  All right.  I haven't heard it.  We haven't heard it either.  This was the start of the JV and Elvis show, which is on right after us here in New York City when we do, you know, commercial radio at Free FM, okay?  We went late because of Anthony's situation.  We had Heffron Ramirez, who played Pedro and Napoleon Dynamite, waiting around. 
[03:08:30]  So we figured, okay, we're going to go late today and at least get the interview in because he came all the way.  The publicist was sitting there, blah, blah, blah, okay?  And they didn't like that.  The JV and Elvis show.  New York.  Zoloft.  Six.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Zoloft.  Axel.  Xanax.  Okay, I'm good.  So what, we got like 30 seconds and then back to a mother-effing 15-minute break of commercials? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, a block.  You're calling it commercial block.  Nonstop commercials.  Back to back to back to back.  That last interview was effing riveting.  Ha!  Oh, boy.  Two guys that don't get radio.  Two guys that don't get radio.  Oh, boy.  They had an opportunity to talk to maybe four to five times the audience they usually talk to, and they used that time to trash us.  That's real smart, guys. 
[03:09:30]  Real smart.  And let me say this.  We did not throw out the first trashing.  We even thanked them at the end for letting us go.  Yeah.  Yeah, we didn't thank, we thanked them.  We didn't throw out a trashing, and they're fucking trashing us.  So now, go fuck yourself.  Well, someone tell them to give us a call immediately.  Tell those faggots to call immediately.  We don't hide behind microphones.  Give us a call right now, and we'll discuss this. 
[03:10:00]  You got a problem?  And I will explain to you how radio works, and I'll explain to you how maybe someday you can be the number one show on XM Satellite Radio and be syndicated to 25 huge radio stations across America.  I'll explain it to you.  I will educate you.  I will do Radio 101 so you get it, and maybe someday you, too, will have a big show.  Why does everybody except Ron and Fez have to be stupid?  I don't understand why you've got to pick a fucking fight with this program. 
[03:10:30]  I would almost understand if we had a regular show, and then we were just showing our balls and said, you know what, we're going late today because we just feel like it.  It wasn't about that.  We were doing some compelling radio.  People were riveted.  We got emails from people saying, I didn't go to work.  You know, I went to work late.  I'm in a parking lot waiting to go inside.  You know, they pretty much stopped their morning routine to listen to the show.  So when we said we're going late, trust me, everyone was waiting until we finally signed off. 
[03:11:00]  And a lot of those people probably kept the station on, which gives you an opportunity to talk to a lot more people.  What else did they say?  They only said they wanted to edit more than that.  It was really worth it.  Yeah.  It was worth the 15 minutes of spots on our show.  Oops.  What time is it?  Okay, we're logging in at 9.32.  Feels like noon.  So how long until the first break?  Because there's not a mother-effing listener left after that long of a break.  How long are we? 
[03:11:30]  If we break right now, this second, then my break's going to last for a week.  I'm going home.  We're not going to play.  Nicole, you're in charge here, right?  I'm not going to play another nine commercials in this hour.  But I'm glad we had the riveting interview.  It was really worth it.  Except for the rest of the hour.  Fuck you.  He's really angry.  You know, fuck you, man.  The commercial spots.  Just play fucking five hours of commercials. 
[03:12:00]  It'll do better in the ratings.  The suckers.  We're dragging our fucking ratings down with your shitty nine to ten hour.  It's what you're doing.  You're killing our fucking ratings, douchebags.  Fucking assholes.  Have them call the show right now.  E-Rock, can you get them on the line?  Maybe I ought to be a little humble when a quarter of our show is being fucked.  Why won't they take the call? 
[03:12:30]  Because they're doing a riveting radio show.  You've got a lot of shit to say.  Let's talk.  Yeah.  The screener, we won't let us.  Real fucking save when we're out of the building, little fucking asshole.  Yeah, their screener won't put us on, so we're trying through their producer.  What is the screener saying?  Said they don't want to talk to you.  We're not putting you through.  Tell them, get on the air, or we'll play a piece of Paltoff tape they might not want  to fucking hear.  Oof.  What is that?  Well, I don't know what Ed's talking about. 
[03:13:00]  I do.  We prepare for every battle in advance.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We've got a couple of things up our sleeve.  Let's just say...  Landmines get planted.  That's right.  There were a few landmines planted a long time ago when we didn't feel like we could  trust these guys.  We're not stupid.  We know fucking the right way to...  There's a reason why we're so huge in radio, okay? 
[03:13:30]  Captivating.  Right.  The art of war.  Opie and Anthony.  I know.  That's right.  Norton, do you have any explanations now you want to get out of the way?  What?  They know everything about me.  But that was funny.  Don't stare at me.  I thought it was a cigar.  You said explanations.  You tripped on explanations.  You're 48 and you couldn't say explanations.  And you want to hear more?  Oh, these fucking Nissan's. 
[03:14:00]  My daughter married a Nissan.  What's up?  Okay.  E-Rock has an update, Anthony.  All right.  Apparently, they have a guest on right now and they don't want to take it.  Oh, riveting guest.  What riveting fucking guest?  We're not exactly sure.  The screener said they have a guest.  They have our number.  We have their number.  We're going to call them back in about 15, 20 minutes.  Without waiting 15, 20 minutes.  Why we wait for them. 
[03:14:30]  Exactly.  Let's just trash them.  All right.  Let me go back to the audio.  Enough.  All right.  Let's go to Claire in Staten Island.  Hello, Claire.  I'm heated.  Heated?  Absolutely heated.  I can't even.  I'm like, my heart's pounding.  I'm so pissed right now.  Why do they do this to you?  That is a great question.  Oh, no.  No, really.  Like, have some effing respect.  That's what I just said to the program director, along with.  I'm sorry.  I just, I don't like them. 
[03:15:00]  I like Opie and Anthony, but their time, you know, is.  Till nine.  Till nine.  And then that's when we're supposed to be on.  And we should all have respect for each other.  I have a great.  Ah, shut up.  All right.  Listen, JV and Elvis.  And fuck you, Claire from Staten Island.  You fucking Thorazine cunt.  We get to stay on as long as we want.  All the bosses behind the scenes have begged us to go to 10 every day.  We can't because of XM.  But they did hint and say, look, you guys can push it as far as you want. 
[03:15:30]  As far as you want.  We're supposed to get off the air over there at 845, by the way.  We're already getting off the air now at 8.56.  We've already stretched it 11 minutes, and we're starting to push even closer to nine  o'clock, because that's what the big bosses behind the scenes want from the Opie and Anthony  show.  And as far as how about some respect, the last thing Opie said was, hey, man, thanks to  JV and Elvis.  Thanks, though, guys, for letting us go along.  And I went, yeah, thanks a lot, guys.  We did thank you.  What respect?  You want us to suck your dick in the hallway?  You want respect. 
[03:16:00]  We want ratings in the nine o'clock hour.  That's right.  It's so wrong.  We got shit averaged into our fucking ratings.  Shit.  Ant, we couldn't hear you, man.  You dropped that a little bit.  I said we got shit averaged into our fucking last hour.  Respect.  All right, here we go.  More audio.  That's when we're supposed to be on, and we should all have respect for each other.  I have a great deal of respect for them and their show.  But, you know, yeah, we have our show. 
[03:16:30]  It's supposed to start at nine o'clock.  I mean, if you had like that.  And for us, it's difficult anyway to do middays.  But, I mean, we're willing to, man, you know, here's our opportunity to be in New York with  a huge audience.  And come on after Opie and Anthony, and I'm thankful for that.  But I just told the program director.  We gave you a massive audience today because of that.  Now you're just a babbling ass.  You don't know what you're saying.  It's great to follow us because we have a big audience. 
[03:17:00]  Well, today we had even a bigger audience.  Fuck these guys.  Fuck them.  Audience, come on after Opie and Anthony, and I'm thankful for that.  But I just told the program director, I'm not interested.  If this is the way we're going to keep doing this, I'm going back home.  Bye.  And I wanted to see you.  You're going to leave New York?  You're going to leave New York?  Well, Ron and Fez are waiting in the wing, so leave.  Yeah, when they find another show?  Leave.  Go.  Goodbye. 
[03:17:30]  Goodbye.  Leave.  Unbelievable.  You can join the long list of radio guys that came to New York and failed.  You'll be on the same list as Darian O'Toole and Tom Likas.  I want to say Likas.  Likas.  Likas, but I start saying his real name.  I fucked it up.  Go ahead.  And everybody else.  Half of them, you don't even know their names anymore.  Oh, they're calm enough to come here to New York to do afternoons.  Wow.  Thanks, guys. 
[03:18:00]  It's like he said, I have respect for them.  That's like a fucking open mic here going, yeah, that Dennis Miller's great.  And it's not a real thing of respect.  It's just something you say in the middle of an argument so you can't be accused of trashing.  It's phony.  Exactly.  Meanwhile, he did with nothing but trashing right from the phone.  We're going on in a minute.  I'm in the future, and looking back, I see that band is playing the Shapiro Bar Mitzvayne  Saratoga next Saturday.  However, the future is looking bright for the rest of you.  Your clothes will change colors on command.  Robots will perform surgery and never leave sponges inside patients. 
[03:18:30]  You'll even use cell phones that can translate English.  And it's still here?  French.  Yes, I'm here.  Of course, the French of the future haven't changed much.  You didn't really expect everything to be rosy here, did you?  Step into the future during Wired Magazine's Next Fest, the technology and innovation festival  for kids of all ages.  I can play in the commercials on XM.  November 29th through Sunday, October 1st.  Whatever.  I didn't say that for creation. 
[03:19:00]  Presented by GE and sponsored by Atari, Autodesk, BlackBerry, Citi, Datapipe, Discovery Channel,  GM, Intel, Pfizer, The Science Channel, and Official Hospital.  All right, we get it.  92.3.  Go round!  With J.B. and Elvis.  On 3FM.  And Jackie has joined us, but Jackie Clark.  Just wait a second, babe.  Okay.  O&A.  All right, what's the problem? 
[03:19:30]  What's going on?  And then I'll move forward.  Hey, guys, what's up?  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  You tell me what's the problem.  What's the problem?  You have the problem.  What's the problem?  The problem is we're scheduled to be on at 9 o'clock.  Yeah, and every day since we've been there, since April, you've gone on.  One fucking day, we run over.  Listen, you understand that we're live here, and you can't say the F word on...  All right, I'm in my car, I forget. 
[03:20:00]  One day, we decide to go over because we have something going on, not just an interview.  We have something going on that we were talking about.  One day...  The personal stuff I can understand, but then the interview you can take to XM.  It's not like it's this huge thing that has to be on...  You're not that stupid, right?  You're not that stupid.  The guy was sitting there for an hour in the studio with a publicist.  He couldn't just walk over to XM.  It was a lot easier at that point to do the interview. 
[03:20:30]  Secondly, we did not know that Anthony's personal situation was going to end perfectly at 5 to 9.  We thought we were going to do more on it.  When we went into commercials, Anthony got a phone call that said everything is going to be okay.  So that ended that situation.  We still had the guy that wanted to do an interview with us.  So we said, okay, we'll go late and we'll do an interview.  And then we'll thank JV and Elvis, which we did.  And we left the show to you guys.  We did thank you at the end of the day.  So we thanked you.  Oh, thank you.  And then I thanked you.  You said that with respect.  One day, we went over and the first thing you did was get us to trash us. 
[03:21:00]  You weren't trashed.  I made it very clear that I have respect for you.  But as far as management goes, I made that very clear.  We heard the audio.  Did I say that, did you hear all of the audio where I say I do have respect for you and that I've said nothing but you guys?  No, you said you have respect for us, but we should have respect for you.  It was one of those things.  If you don't get that, I don't know what to tell you. 
[03:21:30]  We left you guys with a massive audience today because of what was happening in Anthony's personal life.  No one was touching their dials.  So we gave you probably, I don't know, three or four times the audience you would normally have at 9 o'clock.  Come on.  That's ridiculous.  Listen, the show that we're scheduled to do starts at 9 o'clock.  I don't give a crap about the schedule.  If we want to go late, we're going to go late.  That's what management wants from us.  Oh, we didn't know that.  We're supposed to leave the, we're supposed to leave, we're supposed to leave free FM at 845 every day. 
[03:22:00]  What I'm saying is that, you know, I'm looking for a situation where we're not secondary to anything.  And if you do it one time, then it's going another time and another time and another time.  Earn it then.  Earn the right for that.  It doesn't just get given to you.  And what do you think?  We have earned the right to that.  What are you talking about?  Not according to the latest ratings.  You haven't earned anything in New York yet.  It's because it's a midday show.  It's because of the audience.  If we were in prime time slot, we'd have the same thing. 
[03:22:30]  We proved ourselves in a major market and dominated the entire time.  All right, then go back there.  It's something we're considering.  Then go back.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Go back.  Bye-bye.  Management wants us to 10 o'clock.  Maybe they should let you in on that.  And they're negotiating that with XM.  Howard Stern earned the markets, not you.  Oh, all right.  You're going to go after us with the Howard thing.  Oh, wow.  That really hurts.  That really hurts.  We're going to talk about earning it.  Howard says earn got all those markets, and they look for the replacement. 
[03:23:00]  Then why weren't you the replacement?  Why weren't you the replacement?  Why are you stuck in middays?  Why weren't you the replacement?  Why did they stick you in middays?  Go ahead.  Keep swearing on the airwaves.  I didn't curse once, you jackass.  I said, why did they stick you in middays?  You're dumping out because you know I'm right.  I didn't curse once.  Yeah, see, this show's on XM, so for you to make believe we're cursing so you guys can  dump out is pretty lame. 
[03:23:30]  No one is cursing.  The F word.  No one is cursing.  Go ahead.  Dump out whenever you don't want the audience here.  We're not dumping anything.  Why are you saying we're cursing?  Now, if you record that, you'll be able to see that we didn't dump anything.  Look, man.  If you guys are miserable at Free FM, what can I tell you?  But, you know, it was a special day today.  We gave you a huge audience, and that's that.  If you don't understand that, I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, it's not like this is happening every day.  So, obviously, you guys got more crap going on behind the scenes.  We do. 
[03:24:00]  So, don't take it out on us, all right?  Don't take it out on us.  And that's why I still gave you guys respect.  Like I said, you guys have a great show.  I've said it several times.  I don't care if you think we have a great show.  You guys had to bring up the cheap shot with Howard.  All right, you got your cheap shot.  It's cute.  We earned syndication a long time ago.  We were on 19 stations on our own.  We did that.  Not Howard or no one else, okay?  Let's call it what it is.  What is it? 
[03:24:30]  What is it?  What is it?  Howard Stern had that morning drive slot in several markets,  and that was because of what he built.  And why did they put you guys on it?  Excuse me.  We had afternoon drive in most of those markets as well,  and we earned that.  So it was an obvious move to move us into that slot  when we became available and figured it out with the company.  Okay?  Then why another stupid show that's going to kiss up to Howard  and think Howard's going to take care of that? 
[03:25:00]  Why then, when David Lee Roth failed,  did they have to come to this show on XM  instead of just pulling you guys in if you earned it?  I didn't say that we earned it.  That was the smartest move to put you guys there.  I've said that time and time again.  Dude, you guys have some kind of problem going on with manager.  Whatever.  I understand that.  I've had many years of that crap going on in my career.  But to take it out on us because we went a half hour  because Ant had one of the most amazing stories to tell on the radio  just tells me you guys just don't get how to do a radio show. 
[03:25:30]  I do have a problem with management,  and that's what I was expressing.  Not when you started talking about how it was a riveting interview.  We heard the audio.  We heard the way you started, and then you backpedaled.  We're not new to radio, guys.  We know what a friggin' jab is.  We know what a jab is.  What do you think, we're dopes?  Listen.  We heard the audio.  Right.  You were jabbing, and then you backpedaled.  That interview, I mean, we should be on at 9 o'clock.  That interview should go to your show.  We shouldn't be waiting for some, I can understand if it was God on the phone. 
[03:26:00]  It wasn't some huge star.  Well, I understand.  It's got to suck that you've got to wait for us to be done every day.  I don't know what to tell you.  It'll happen more in the future, so you either deal with it,  or you get another gig.  Right.  I mean, the fact is the company wants us until 10 o'clock, okay?  They're negotiating with XM.  They can't figure out how to make it work for both sides,  or it would have been done already.  All right.  Well, by the way.  All right.  We were supposed to get off the air at 8.45 every morning.  They already told us we could stretch as far as we can. 
[03:26:30]  We're up to, what, 8.56 at this point.  We're pushing closer to 9 every day.  And today we decided to go late because there was an unbelievable thing going on in Anthony's personal life.  And most radio shows don't have the balls to bring that on their show, but Ant did today.  And you're talking about why don't we show your respect?  Oh, thank you.  And I thank you when we left.  I didn't hear that.  I was arguing with the program.  Well, maybe you should have heard it before you started smashing the interview.  There's no way for me to hear it because I'm on the air with the program.  Well, then don't you feel like a silly goose at 9, not on right now. 
[03:27:00]  We understand that.  We understand that.  But it happened.  My issue wasn't with you.  What?  My issue wasn't with you.  Then you shouldn't have mentioned the interview quality or any of that stuff.  That part was a joke.  It wasn't a joke.  We do this for a living.  We know when something is said in jest and when something real is said and then backpedaled on.  We're not dummies.  That's why I wanted to make it clear that I have respect for you guys.  But I mean, I'm going to come on and joke about it and handle it the best way that I can because. 
[03:27:30]  I'll be completely honest with you.  I did not hang up.  That was nobody in this studio.  Everyone's seeing my hands.  I did not hang up.  Hope is holding blueberries.  I'm across the room with a phone and Anton is car phone.  I mean, they hung up.  Oh, really?  That just got hung up on which side?  We didn't hang it up.  We didn't hang up.  All right.  We did not hang up.  Well, here's some more audio from that first break.  Right.  And I wanted this to be my home, but I don't want to do it. 
[03:28:00]  I just don't want to work for any place where we're secondary.  I know.  We're all a team.  We should be on the same.  I mean, the place we came from, we had already done that and we had done it for a long time,  so it was time to move on to something bigger and better.  But I would much rather not sit in the office waiting like that.  I know.  I understand.  Let's go to Anthony in Connecticut.  Hello, Anthony.  Yeah, guys.  I dropped to work every day.  I turned it on.  I couldn't find you.  I was thinking to myself, wow, they blew them off again.  They screwed them over again.  And sure enough, your intro music comes on and they screwed you over. 
[03:28:30]  You guys are not secondary.  You're third because the show in the afternoon is the show that you should be.  You guys should be three to seven and drive.  And it's a joke that you're not.  And I would leave if I were you.  I'm close.  My unemployment ran out.  I'm close.  I mean, I hate to do it for the fans that we have built up here in New York, but I'm going to ask for it today.  I am.  I'm going to say as long as, you know, everything is cool and no one's going to be mad and we're going to be without a job, period,  kindly will you let us just another CBS station back where we came from where we can get the respect. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  That's what I'm asking for this afternoon.  We'll see.  Mike in Queens.  Hello, Mike.  Yeah, what's going on, man?  Buddy.  Yeah, man, I'm an ONA fan.  You know, I've listened to a long time.  But, dude, at least when you guys interview somebody who's a stiff, you call them a stiff and you treat them like a moron when the person is a moron.  Right.  Can you pause this for a minute?  This is a moron.  What the fuck are you talking about?  They interviewed that fat chick and they didn't have the balls to say, yeah, we said you suck.  They blamed it on us, which was actually very funny.  But don't say that they called people out. 
[03:29:30]  Right.  Right.  They fucking backed down.  There was a 300-pound silverback in the room.  And they couldn't tell her.  They didn't think she was fucking funny.  You and your fucking callers.  Shut up.  And actually, the interview wasn't that bad.  It wasn't.  I don't understand.  Was it great?  No.  Did it suck?  No.  It was a regular celebrity interview.  That's all.  Nothing special, really.  What?  They said we hung up on them.  We didn't hang up on them.  And they know we didn't.  No, they had to go to...  The guy hung up in the middle of what he was...  They had to go to break because management, you know, tells them what to do. 
[03:30:00]  And they didn't know how to end the thing.  So, all of a sudden, they hung up the phone.  I thought they couldn't handle what we were saying.  You know, I'm so sick of these radio guys that just lie and they're not accountable for their lies.  From now on, I want a video camera on me 24 hours a day.  You don't need one.  If there was a video in here, I could have proven that I did not hang up on them.  If we hung up, we would say it.  We've never hung up and not said it.  Opie's hang-up hands, Cam.  The guy... 
[03:30:30]  The guy...  Or whatever.  I'll allow him to do that.  I know.  Listen, you guys are the best show in, as far as I'm concerned, the world.  Even China?  Wow.  Hello.  Did you say something?  Hello.  Ha-ha!  Hello.  You are the best even in China.  Hello.  The door to your soul.  Hello.  I want to explain something while these guys rip on our ratings.  I've already explained that, and they know that as well. 
[03:31:00]  We don't know the first thing about you.  And I'm telling you, listeners, because we're an honest show, if you put us in a drive-time position...  An honest show?  We don't know the first thing about you, J.B. Elvis.  Are we on with you, or do we just have to listen to your show?  In the shower...  All right, we'll just comment about what you're saying.  Going to school, getting up, listening to morning radio, or in the afternoon when they're driving home,  then that's where the huge audiences are.  Exactly.  And they put the best shows...  Don't try to hold that crap about having more numbers in mid-day. 
[03:31:30]  We're doing pretty well in mid-days in D.C.  We've got to be on delay.  Right.  Your show far exceeds ours.  You guys have a great show.  We have a great show.  But don't act like it's so effing amazing that that's why your numbers are there and ours are here.  We're in mid-day.  Thank you.  What the hell can we do?  Nothing.  What you can do is find someone that wants you in morning drive or afternoon drive.  I wouldn't accept a mid-day show, personally.  Jackie, ho, ho, ho.  Hello, ho, ho.  There she is.  I am, I am.  Hello.  Those guys pissed me off. 
[03:32:00]  I want to come down and kick their ass.  Come on.  Hello.  Hello.  I can't stand them.  Hello.  You guys are rolling the airwaves.  Hello.  Thank you.  Hello.  Don't listen to anything that happens.  Hello.  You guys are going to take over something one day.  Why are we listening to their show?  Are they coming back on with us?  They've moved to take them over.  No, absolutely not.  Oh, you know something?  I'll tell you this much.  That dude that was saying, you jackass and calling me stupid, because they got, you know, 
[03:32:30]  14 guys around them and security at all times.  I'll tell you this much.  You won't tomorrow come say that to my face.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  I'll be in Pittsburgh, stupid.  Say it to my face, bro.  Say it right to my face.  Which one is even asking that?  I mean...  The fat one or the bald one?  It's radio.  Yeah, that's why I know pussies like you hide behind that mic.  Oh, fuck you and fuck your mother, you hack.  Fuck you.  A few of them look a bit intimidating.  I'm not going to lie.  And yeah, and he's got huge security. 
[03:33:00]  I would want no piece of that.  This is like Clarkson.  Did not say that.  Don't hurt me.  But the clown that's calling me all those...  I'm calling you those names because you accuse me of cursing, you scumbag.  I'll walk you all the way tomorrow, and we'll see if you say it to me then.  Right.  Yeah.  Don't say it to my face.  Come out.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, man.  I'm tired of them.  You guys...  You guys got to do something about owning that.  Like what?  Like, suck our dicks.  That's what they got to do.  All right, let's go to Pothead Ed, our buddy. 
[03:33:30]  What's going on, bud?  Yo, yo.  How you guys doing?  What's up, doghouse?  What?  Yo.  What?  I was going to say, man.  It sounded like an adult arguing with a couple of kids when you were talking to them, Jay.  Yeah, didn't it really?  Completely.  Their whole audience is based off of Howard's remnants, and yet their whole show is ripping  on Howard.  It's pointless and ridiculous.  All right.  That's good.  You know what I'm talking about?  And...  Can you get them on the phone?  I will tell them that I said that.  We've given our respect to Howard, and I think the listeners can back us up on we've given 
[03:34:00]  our respect to ONA.  We've given a whole lot of things to deal with.  I'm going to tell you right now, like that comedy show.  Yeah, right.  We did that.  We started that.  I started that big comedy show.  Yeah, they're saying we stole the comedy show idea.  I built that from nothing.  There were no radio stations doing any comedy shows.  I built that off of just showing up to a comedy show one day, seeing Carlos Mencia and  a couple of other guys.  And I go, you know, I want to... 
[03:34:30]  We were going to do the traveling virus shows in 2002 before we were thrown off the air.  It was like $25,000 every year.  Uh-huh.  I know.  And they would try it in other markets, and it wouldn't really work.  It wouldn't draw that much.  It's like it's behind it.  So, when we came to the station, we told the company we would really like to, you know,  do that here in New York.  It's going to take some time to build an audience.  Right.  People aren't going to like us right away, but we would like to do this.  We're going to be going to 10 in the very near future.  Let's do it.  And some promoter came along who put it together. 
[03:35:00]  Not ONA.  A promoter came along.  No, it was ONA, you fucking dummy.  This is a problem with radio.  You can just lie through your teeth, and, you know, the listeners will buy into it.  It's an idea I had years and years and years ago, a way of giving you guys a really good  payday.  That was one of our main gigs.  I thought it was J.B. and Elvis' idea.  We always respect them.  We said it's not you that we're upset with.  I'm going to shut up.  And it's usually something once a week. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Heavy that we're dealing with.  Hitting us on the hands.  So, and if they don't, I was talking to them like an adult.  I was saying, look, we're going to come on and be a little sarcastic about it.  That's, you know, the best thing to do.  It's not like I said, oh, I hate those motherfuckers and blah, blah, blah.  I'm just saying I want to be treated as equal here.  You're not equal.  You're not equal.  Yeah, you've got to earn equality in this business.  You've got to earn respect in this business.  I don't even know what they do on their show.  I just nod to the guy in the hall when we're leaving to do the XM portion of the show. 
[03:36:00]  And the guys have been jealous of us since the first day we were over there.  You can tell just how they look at us.  Like, oh, they get all frustrated.  Why won't they take the call?  I don't know.  Yeah, they thanked you guys.  I don't know.  You were dealing with your own stuff.  You want to hear an impression of their show?  Can you call the hotline number and tell them that?  Tell them if they got.  Thank God.  I tried to take the gloves off with these guys.  Yeah.  This show is brutal.  It's brutal.  It's a brutal show.  Well, according to them, when they stay on over now, we finally get some listeners. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  They gave us a big audience of 15 minutes of commercials.  I wouldn't mind out the gate.  Like I said, I'm sure they have a massive, huge, huge, huge following.  I mean, to me, it would be better if we just, you know,  got along and kept everything cool.  But either way, I don't care.  But I mean, if we.  New York likes the radio.  If we went.  But if we went to an individual, a market where we're both starting off.  Yeah.  Where we start at one station and they start. 
[03:37:00]  And because, yeah, they got a major lead ahead of us.  I mean, I'm sure they got a diehard following that right now just hates them.  You're off the air for 26 months and then on satellite radio  while you were here in terrestrial radio.  Right, right.  We're going to win.  We're going to kill it.  Right.  That's guaranteed.  And if we're allowed to say what we really want to say while they're attacking me,  it would be a whole different story.  Then why can't you?  Why can't you?  Wow.  Take a break.  Break time?  That's some brave radio right there.  Why can't you?  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  No, me and Andy.  They just, they're great. 
[03:37:30]  They're awesome.  The type of people we're talking about now is when you see a woman and she's so fat,  you want to go right past ridicule and just assault her.  Yeah, like physically.  Just, you want to just grab her and go, stop eating.  Yeah, what are you eating?  Not even by the shirt collars, by the fat around the collarbone.  And they go, I don't eat a lot.  It's a thyroid.  All I have is celery.  Don't man be rocked.  Weekday mornings at 6 on Free FM.  This is Saturday and Sunday. 
[03:38:00]  There you go.  Good boys.  Make sure you get our promo in.  There is nothing I hate more.  What a bunch of dopes.  They trash us and then they play our promo.  And the guy who was saying.  And they don't have the balls to like maybe stop the promo, play something over the promo,  blow off the promo.  No, they just played it because that's what management tells them to do.  And the guy who was calling me a jackass, he was saying stop cursing and no one was cursing.  He's a phony.  Yeah, I missed the last bit of that because I was going from my lovely car into my palatial 
[03:38:30]  mansion.  But what was that?  Everyone is laughing because they all picked up on the fact after they tried to trash us,  which was a lame attempt, they played an O&A commercial.  Yeah, I heard that.  Boy, if that doesn't speak volumes.  Unbelievable.  What fucking idiots. 
[03:39:00]  Everyone is picking up on it.  How great is it that after they get done trashing you, they have to play your promo?  Play our promo, boy.  That's why you're not doing morning radio, by the way.  You can't think outside the box.  Why are we doing it?  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Go back to your one market.  Have fun.  He wasn't even number one in San Francisco.  He's acting like he was.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I've been in radio.  I have no idea what they did.  Since I was 18 years old and I never even heard of him. 
[03:39:30]  The girl there, the lady there.  That's the God's honest truth.  Darren O'Toole?  No.  She didn't do that well.  Oh, yeah, she's pretty cool, actually.  I forgot her name.  She's cool.  I know a lot of radio guys.  I've never heard of these guys.  If they were successful, all right, great.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe they weren't.  I have no idea, though.  They were never on my radar screen.  Their listeners have to call.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They load up the calls with people.  Hey, they're so good.  Oh, shut up. 
[03:40:00]  Were their ratings bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really bad.  And they're like, it would be different if we were an afternoon drive or morning drive.  Then fine, an afternoon drive or morning drive show.  Then why aren't you?  That's how it works in radio.  Then why aren't you?  Your excuse is you're not getting ratings because you're a midday show?  Well, then if you're that great.  If you're that great, then go find a morning drive show or an afternoon drive show.  We're sucking up all those shows because they can't find talent.  That's the reason why we're getting syndicated all over the place. 
[03:40:30]  Every midday show has to go, well, we're at a one because, you know, we're in midday.  There's no midday show that's doing well.  And aren't we doing well in D.C.?  We're on delay there.  We're doing okay.  It's a fortunate thing made on the internet.  Jesus.  Enough.  First of all, we have a neighbor to show the doghouse.  All right.  First of all, we're at the doghouse.  They invented comics.  Yeah, they're the ones doing comics.  It's laughable that in 2002, we were going to do the traveling virus tour. 
[03:41:00]  And they're trying to take credit for it.  What comedians were you going to get?  And how many people?  What are you going to go to markets, do one show in New York and get fucking 50 people there  and then go to San Francisco and do a show?  Where were you going to go with it?  I hate to tell you, the comedy tour is not a new concept.  We did take it and make it our own and make it bigger than pretty much most of the comedy  tours that came before it.  But this thing has been going on for years with radio stations, without radio stations. 
[03:41:30]  Sam Kinison says, hey, I got this troop of comedians I'm going to take on the road with me.  Dice does it.  It's not a new concept.  But we did take it and make it into something pretty damn big.  They're going to claim they were the ones that started the comedy tour with radio stations?  And then he said the promoter did it, not you guys.  Well, they had it in their minds.  In 2002, you know why you're right?  Because I bought a car over it.  I know.  And all I heard for 26 months was, oh, things were just about to happen for me on the comedy.  I know.  We were going to do a tour.  We got thrown off the air.  I want to know if they got 10, over 10,000, 11,000. 
[03:42:00]  Are those the crowds that they were pulling on their little comedy shows that they were doing?  I want numbers.  I want to know what their comedy shows were doing.  Dang.  Scary.  Talk for a second, Anthony.  What's that?  Talk for a second.  I can't talk.  I'm ready to hop in the shower.  Just hum or something.  I'll be right.  I just got to tell Jimmy.  You want to hear me shower?  Yeah.  Do you have a shower can for Pal Talk?  Hold on.  Oh, it's bringing me out for something. 
[03:42:30]  Talk, boss.  Okay, here.  This should be good.  Am I a good one?  So, Anthony.  Yeah.  Are you excited that everything's going to work out for you over and over?  Shut up.  Don't jinx it, you stupid fucking Jew.  Oh, my God.  Misplaced anger.  Wow.  You're not the nice people.  Wow, I hear that Hitler's a good guy.  Jesus.  Don't jinx it.  Now I have to knock wood and find mahogany, mind you. 
[03:43:00]  I'm in my bathroom.  Are you nude?  No, I'm not nude.  I got a handheld phone, so I can't even take my shirt off.  I wonder how they like getting their...  Gilbert Gottfried is here.  Oh, let me see if it's a speaker word.  Hold on.  I guess I want to...  Talk to us again.  Back on the line, guys.  Hello?  We did not hang up on you, first of all.  Okay.  And I'm the one.  This is Jim Norton.  I'm the one who was calling you a jackass, and I was calling you that because...  Say it to my face, jackass.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  I know you're doing a character because you're in the doghouse.  I'm not doing a character.  Come say it to my face, jackass. 
[03:43:30]  I'm right across the street.  First of all, you're white.  Don't say, biatch.  And second of all, you said we were cursing, and nobody was cursing.  I know what I want.  And no...  I know your dog.  You're in the doghouse.  Shut up.  No one is listening to you.  No one is listening to you.  If you guys are so good, what do you need a comedian on your show for anyway?  That's the best you have?  No, no.  That's not the best.  That's the best you have?  Is it Opie and Anthony, or is it Opie and Anthony and 5,000 comedians? 
[03:44:00]  Maybe it's the drug addict and the guy who can't control him.  Oh, wait.  That's not our show.  His name is Anthony.  Opie is a board op.  That's the best you have?  That's the best you have.  Hey, you two market nobodies, that's the best you have?  Hey, can I ask you guys something?  You guys got to New York.  Can I ask you something?  Can I ask you something?  All right, I'll just shout it then.  Who over there has the drinking problem, by the way?  Who has the drinking problem? 
[03:44:30]  Who has the drinking problem?  Who has the drinking problem?  And who's the other guy that said, man, I can't take this anymore.  You got to really clean up your act.  You got to clean up your act, because I can't take you and your drinking anymore.  Who's got the drinking problem?  Who's got the drinking problem?  Who's got the drinking problem?  Which one has the drinking problem?  Who's got the drinking problem, and who was the guy that goes, man, you got to clean up your act. 
[03:45:00]  I can't take it anymore.  I just can't take it.  You got to get rehab or something.  that I just can't take you and your drinking anymore.  Two years and went psycho.  I thought it was your girl.  Yeah, which one got fired and had to see a psychiatrist.  It was a barn-off.  I think it's your girlfriend that was drunk, right?  And then she's in a psych ward.  That's what the case was.  That is so compelling.  More lies, by the way.  I never went to a shrink.  That's really hilarious.  But we do have audio of one of you guys going, 
[03:45:30]  man, you've got to stop drinking.  You're ruining this show.  I can't take it anymore.  You need to go into rehab.  You need to go into rehab.  We got audio.  You're a married couple.  I mean, Opie, since I've been here,  you have not said one funny thing.  I thought you just said you liked the show.  You don't do honest radio.  The doghouse doesn't do honest radio.  See, more dishonesty from these guys. 
[03:46:00]  I've said not one funny thing, right?  I thought you liked the show.  Why are you lying?  God, how bitter are you guys  that we're sitting in the morning show slide  and you're stuck in middays, right?  Middays.  And not even getting ratings.  And don't even have the balls to go out there  and get a better job.  So you use excuses like,  well, we don't have ratings  because we're a midday show.  Middays.  If we were in mornings or afternoons,  we would get the ratings.  We're doing middays.  Don't get a morning or afternoon drive show,  you pussies.  I'm the pussy.  Yes.  Come on back over.  Stop with your radio shtick. 
[03:46:30]  A bunch of pussies.  You know this business is starving to find real talent,  so go out there and get a morning show  or an afternoon drive show.  Get one.  Get one.  Go ahead.  Get one.  Instead of hiding behind poor midday ratings,  go out there and get a real radio show.  You said you guys are great.  I would love to see it.  You're doing fairly well  since your return to New York.  Why wasn't it you?  Why wasn't it you? 
[03:47:00]  Are you guys just bitter  that they gave us the morning show?  Are you?  I'm sorry about that.  I don't know what to tell you.  You were in that seat.  Without you,  they would not have gotten all those markets.  You were in that seat  and you weren't good enough to get the gig.  The gig was already taken.  You were in that seat.  Do your research, moron.  You were in that seat.  Do your research, dork.  You're not good enough.  Wear the bandaid on your nose,  you little bump.  You're not good enough  to get the seat.  Who's cracking them in the nose 
[03:47:30]  every day to wear the bandaid?  You're not good enough.  Need you in coke?  You're the one crying  like some codependent wife  to go to rehab.  You little woman.  Slow down.  You little bitch.  You need to go to rehab, honey.  You need to go to rehab.  Stop your drinking.  You got to go to rehab.  Who does?  You do.  Stop your drinking.  Wait, you guys aren't going to be honest.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[03:48:00]  Anthony was really honest today  about what was going on in his personal life.  Why don't you guys discuss  who had the drinking problem on the show  and how you were trying to talk to him about  and going, I can't take this anymore.  You really got to stop drinking.  Why don't you guys do a real honest radio show  and talk about the real problems between you two  and that one is drinking his face off  and that the other one is begging him to stop.  Let's get real.  Let's get real.  Why don't you talk about that on your show?  Then maybe you would get ratings in midday.  Who's begging?  Who is begging?  I mean, half that stuff, I was like, 
[03:48:30]  wait a minute.  You did that after we did it.  So monitoring shows.  Now we start from these guys.  That's a good way to put your stuff together.  You know, don't even attack you  that came up with the comedy show, by the way.  I didn't even know who the fuck you guys were.  Oh, so nice dump there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So anyway, who came up with that comedy show?  Wait, 2002, dude.  Who came up?  We did.  2002, I'm talking about 1994, dickwad.  Where were you?  No one knew who you were in 94. 
[03:49:00]  Wait, you've been doing that you all that long  and you're still not in the morning drive show.  You're still in midday.  You're still in midday.  You're still in midday.  You're still in midday.  You're still in midday.  Who put that together?  Who put that together?  You're still in midday?  Who put that together?  You're still in midday?  Answer the question.  All of these videos and you're still in midday.  And here's the one that's not funny.  I don't give a credit.  I'm not funny, but I'm being heard in 25 cities  and we're the number one show on XM.  Now why don't you tell us your resume?  Oh my God, I'm a board op.  I couldn't even handle a midday show at Light FM 
[03:49:30]  because all I can do is turn on the mic  and let Anthony be funny.  You're in midday, dude.  And I'll give Anthony that much.  Anthony, like I've always said, you are funny,  but the other board op is the truth.  People know what I do on this show.  You're in midday.  George, George.  You're in 12 years and you're in midday.  Dude, why?  Right.  Why?  I'm asking you honestly.  Because we got fired from the station.  Because we got fired from the station.  Why are you in midday if you think you're so great?  Why are you in midday if you think you're so great?  Why are you in midday if you think you're so great? 
[03:50:00]  Why?  Because everything was already said.  We were told by management  we would have been in another spot  if we would have come here.  They didn't know about us.  See, these guys don't know the truth of a joke.  We have a terrible agent named Bob Eatman.  Terrible agent.  He's a joke.  Dude, maybe if you were good enough, you'd have a morning drive show.  You're acting like you've got some amazing show.  Your show's all right.  Then why did you say it was good before?  Why don't you do honest radio?  Good means all right.  It's not amazing.  I mean, it ain't like your Howard Stern. 
[03:50:30]  You just said you didn't like Opie.  You don't like the show.  So why don't you be honest?  No, you don't even have to say that you're on conflict.  You're not even on conflict.  And when they have the comedian on that doesn't even fit into the title,  I mean, why shouldn't they respect you?  Do you get paid as much as them?  You're not even good enough for morning or afternoon.  Are you getting paid as much as them?  Because Opie is nothing more than a board-off.  Opie is on a 25 scale, and you're not good enough for morning or afternoon.  You're a midday show, and you're not good enough.  Listen, we were number one solid for 10 years. 
[03:51:00]  Then where are you?  So we got to restart somewhere.  Then where are you guys?  You restarted on satellite where you had, despite your rise.  We did have no choice, so why would they cut you on?  Why aren't you in Chicago?  In San Francisco right now, you have a 0.0.  Why are you only in these markets?  Why are you only in these markets?  You guys have horrible numbers.  You have less than what our midday numbers have in these other markets. 
[03:51:30]  They know that.  And you're on in morning drive.  You know why.  What do you say, board-off?  What's the board-off saying?  Doghouse.  What?  Thank you.  Is that actually something you guys say?  First of all, the board-off's got a big thing on Madison Square Garden.  He's on every bus in this city.  The board-off is on every bus in this city.  That's really going to hurt that a board-off is doing much better in his career than you guys.  Dude, you're going to have to try a lot harder than call me a board-off.  You don't think I've dealt with that my whole career?  But I know what I do for a fucking radio show. 
[03:52:00]  Hey, dude, which one of you guys has to go to rehab?  Honestly.  I went to rehab when I was 17.  Which one of you guys has the problem?  Which one of you guys has the problem?  Yeah, who's got the drinking problem?  I'm honest about my old problems, man.  Who's got the drinking problem?  No, dude, honestly, honestly.  Who's got the drinking problem?  Dude, stop trying to be funny.  Honestly, answer.  Who's got the drinking problem?  Anthony doesn't have a drinking problem.  I've never had a drinking problem, but one of you guys has a drinking problem, and the 
[03:52:30]  other guy begged, begged like a little girl, man, I can't take you when you're drinking.  You're going to have to do something about it.  We got audio, buddy.  Who is that?  We got audio.  I told you, you're going to have to try a little harder than that.  I'm up for a challenge.  Try to get to me.  Try to get to me, but calling me a board-off is not going to get the job done.  I'm a board-off that's on the side of buses.  I'm a board-off that is a star of a TV commercial.  I'm a board-off that sat on David Letterman's couch. 
[03:53:00]  I'm a board-off.  Wow.  I'm a board-off that's a multi-millionaire.  How does that make you feel?  You're in middays with no ratings.  That's got to bother you.  That's got to bother you that the board-off is doing much better than Jamie and Elvis.  Ooh, Jamie and Elvis.  Oh, my God, I'm scared of Jamie and Elvis.  Who is that?  God, they're setting the radio world on fire one market at a time in middays. 
[03:53:30]  Well, sometimes they bring Jackie in for the extra booze, too.  Who was hammered at the radio chick party and had CBS gave him a lot of crap?  Who was the drunk at the party?  Well, one of them has a big drinking problem, but they're not willing to talk about it on the show.  So we've talked about the problems we've had with each other and the stuff that goes on behind the scenes on this show.  We're talking to themselves.  Nobody listens to that.  Mark, what's up?  All right, we're off.  Hey, buddy.  They won't talk about that drinking problem.  We finally needed to freaking do.  Kick those guys' asses. 
[03:54:00]  I say something.  They're watered-down hats.  By the way, is it wrong that I touch myself whenever I hear Jackie talk?  That's okay.  You can do that.  Yeah, that's a good sign.  Jay?  What's up, Jay?  Hey, I just want to tell you, I used to listen to ONA and you guys religiously.  And after today, ONA, I want to tell you on the air, you suck, you shut down.  I'm not listening to you anymore.  And Jackie, I love you, girl.  Thank you very much.  ONA, are you still there?  You know we're still here. 
[03:54:30]  What, that was supposed to bother us, I guess?  I guess that was supposed to bother us that you planted a call from a guy that says he hates the Opie Anthony?  We're going to take them all live.  Let's go.  Just one after another.  Dude, I could do the same thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  You're not honest on your show, man.  What's up, Ryan?  Dude, you're not honest on your show.  Hold on for a second.  Board up.  You're not honest on your show.  Please.  You're not honest.  I'm not honest.  You had a promoter put together my comedy show.  You're insane.  You're insane. 
[03:55:00]  You're insane.  This is how things work.  This is how it works.  If someone wanted to promote the JV and Elvis comedy show, they would have done it.  No one knows you, bro.  They would have done it.  No one knows you, bro.  No one knows you.  That's why you didn't do your comedy show.  There wasn't an interest in it.  I'm trying to get a word in edgewise.  No one knows you, bro.  I mean, you're an embarrassment to yourselves.  You're an embarrassment to yourselves.  If you wanted to do a comedy show, you should have done a comedy show.  But the fact is, you didn't have enough juice.  You didn't have a promoter that was willing to promote it. 
[03:55:30]  And you guys are talking about it in San Francisco.  You're so big.  Sarah is the big one in San Francisco.  Why didn't you just do it then?  Then why didn't you do it?  Why didn't you do it?  Why didn't you just do it?  Why didn't you just do it?  We're working on it.  We're working on it?  You're working on it, huh?  We're trying to get you out.  You're working on it?  We know that you're out.  Who do you got for your comedy show?  Carrot Top, Gallagher.  Who do you got, man?  And I would say Yakov Smirnoff should be available. 
[03:56:00]  Yakov Smirnoff should be available for the JV and Elvis comedy show.  Yakov Smirnoff.  Hey, man.  If you guys are so good.  Yakov Smirnoff.  Management's mistreating you.  You probably could get Judy Tenuta.  Judy Tenuta for the JV and Elvis comedy show.  Judy Tenuta.  Maybe you could get Louie Anderson out of rehab and he could join the comedy show as well.  Talk to you by Dopey and Funny. 
[03:56:30]  Dopey and Funny.  Wow.  That's all you got, bro?  Dude.  That's all you got.  Why is everybody mistreating you guys if you're a talented radio show?  I mean, why won't a promoter give you a show?  Why is it everybody is picking on you guys?  Well, I don't need a promoter to give me a show.  I put that together.  But where is it, bro?  Where is it?  You rode off the back of that.  Where was it?  What?  Where is it?  Where is it?  Where's your comedy show then?  No one's telling us not to do a comedy show.  So who told you not to do a comedy show that you didn't do a comedy show?  Where is it?  Where's your comedy show? 
[03:57:00]  Where's your comedy show?  What's up, guys?  Hey, listen.  I'll be down in Javits Center tomorrow.  And from now on, it's I'm at the 2-9 in the morning.  JV and Elvis, the rest of the day.  That's new.  Thank you, bro.  I'm just doing a comedy tour, too.  Where's your comedy show?  Let's go to...  What's up, Anthony?  Why don't you just do the comedy show?  Who's the biggie?  Are you guys this insecure that you've got to take phone calls praising you right now?  Are you that insecure that you're going to line up a bunch of people that love JV and Elvis? 
[03:57:30]  That is the hackiest radio bit ever.  We just had a huge fight with Opie and Anthony, so let's make ourselves feel good and have a bunch of guys kissing our butts.  That's like radio hack crap.  That's why you're not in Morning Drive.  That's why you're not in Afternoon Drive.  That's why no one wants to promote your comedy show.  You're hacks.  Don't forget when you go to...  You did what management told you, didn't you?  And you played the O&A commercial.  You're a bunch of hacks. 
[03:58:00]  But we're going for a...  With the help of a load of hotties from Headquarters Gentleman's Club, we will attempt to un...  Unbelievable.  Oh, my God.  What a couple of douchebags.  What a couple of douchebags.  But why would you allow yourself to be so mistreated?  Like, if you're this fucking maverick cool radio show, 12 years...  Then why are you in Middays, man?  Why are you?  They're in Middays.  They're so scary talented.  How come they're still in fucking Middays and no one knows who they are? 
[03:58:30]  Do you think CBS wanted to go to the Opie and Anthony show to bail them out?  That's the last thing they wanted to do.  Do you know how much trouble it was to get us back to their company?  Between XM and them?  They could have easily...  If there was one iota of fucking talent out there, especially already working for CBS,  they'd be doing the morning shows, not us.  And JV and Elvis, that scary fucking talent?  Forget about it. 
[03:59:00]  Hey, why don't you remind them about the pal-talk camera being left on?  Well, we...  How about that little bit of fucking audio?  We kept asking them, who's got the drinking problem, who's going to rehab?  Yeah, we referred to that.  And they wouldn't admit it.  Oh, I know.  I was in the shower.  I heard the whole thing on speakerphone.  How great was I, Ant?  Dude, it was just terrible.  Fucking idiot.  These hocks.  See...  They don't know what the fuck to do with themselves.  And then, uh...  Look, I gotta be honest.  I love a good challenge, okay?  But if all you got is to call me a board op, our own listeners, when they want to beat me up, 
[03:59:30]  say that crap.  I know what I do for this radio show.  How old is that?  I know what I do for this radio show.  So you're going to have to come up with something a little better than that.  Here's the problem.  I mean, if I was just a board op, I wish I could tell them this.  If I was just a board op, the company could save a lot of money by just firing me and hiring  a real board op for whatever it would be, $12 an hour.  And you probably wouldn't get line in a day today, right?  Yeah, you should have tuned.  I just want to let everybody know in on what happened there.  We left the pal talk on completely accidentally one day. 
[04:00:00]  And you could say, you know, it was on purpose, but it was.  It was accidental.  We were rushing out of the place, left it on, and they came in at the beginning of their  show.  And one of them was screaming at the other one about being on drugs and look at your eyes.  They're all fucking dilated.  You said you weren't going to do this.  Go to rehab.  You're drunk.  And we have it all on tape.  Now, obviously, we're not allowed to play it, but that's what we heard. 
[04:00:30]  That's what we fucking heard.  And honesty, they're going to be honest?  Get the fuck out of here, lying sacks of shit.  We didn't tape it, actually.  It was taped by a listener.  Yeah, a listener taped it.  It was just a pal talk was still running when we left the studio.  And these idiots, you know, didn't know.  So they start talking.  And that happens.  And somebody, you know, the line was open.  Oops. 
[04:01:00]  There's phony hellos on the hallway.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hi, hi.  Ho, ho.  I guess those are over.  Hey, hey.  Hi, hi.  Ho, ho.  And I know it bugs them that I don't talk to them when I see them.  I just nod like, hey.  Because they brought that up.  I'm like, because I have nothing to say to these guys.  You're like nameless, faceless radio guys that follow us.  We've had a million of you guys after us.  New afternoon show coming to Free FM New York, I think.  New midday show.  New midday show. 
[04:01:30]  It really bothers them that I don't give them some kind of respect.  I don't know anything about them.  I don't need any more friends in radio.  Fuck them.  My quota has been filled with Ron and Fez.  That's it.  And Brother Weez.  That's it.  Why weren't they given the morning slot anywhere?  Why were they totally shut out?  They didn't even get the afternoon slot.  You know what the answer to that is.  Of course I do.  And that's why they're pissed.  And they know the answer, too.  That's why they're so pissed off.  All right.  Kenny's calling me.  I got to catch a plane.  Let's go to Troy in Philly.  Troy.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Yo, guys. 
[04:02:00]  What's up, man?  What's up, Troy?  Long time listener.  Losing to see you back when you were in 94 YSP back in Philly.  Yeah.  Back in originally.  I used to think the same thing, Ope.  Kind of thought you were a big board op.  I didn't realize it was the point of the show.  But today, man, I got to say, one of the best parts of the show with lines like,  I got to say, great line of the day.  Thank you, sir.  I know what I do.  I'm not stupid.  I get paid very well because of what I bring to a radio show and a radio company.  Of course.  I got to explain that shit to fucking those assholes. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, what hap.  And they're lining up people.  Yeah, I'm never listening.  I did listen to O&A.  Oh, yeah.  Then where do you go when our show stops and there starts?  Because obviously the audience fucking disappears.  That old gag.  Let's get a bunch of calls saying how great we are.  You know, I was in the shower.  I had my phone on speakerphone.  Yeah.  And I was nude and shampooing during that whole. 
[04:03:00]  Tell us more.  And I had to listen to it.  What did Opie keep repeating over and over again?  It was so fucking annoying.  I don't know.  I saw it a few times.  I was cracking up because you wouldn't stop.  Oh, Yakov.  Smirnoff.  Yeah, yeah.  Yakov Smirnoff.  Yakov.  And Gallagher.  And Judy.  Judy to nude.  Holy fuck.  Oh, is that funny, man. 
[04:03:30]  I can't fit in comedy towards this guy.  He's just a jerk off.  And he knows he's a fucking relegated to midday's jerk off.  And he knows it.  That's what he is.  And he knows it.  That's why he's angry.  Here's the difference between the two shows.  Every phone line is lit and they all want to just praise us.  Yeah.  Watch.  And how fast.  I'm not going to answer one phone.  Shut their fucking phone lines down, by the way.  How fast.  If we said, you know, oh, they're taking calls from all their scary fans.  Shut down their phone lines.  They'd be down in a second. 
[04:04:00]  In a fucking second, they wouldn't be able to take one call.  So just shut up.  It's so scary.  Go back to where the fuck you came from.  By the way, Mike from FMQB, big fan of the show,  just did a great article on us in the latest issue of FMQB.  Did we throw that online?  The latest article from FMQB?  We should have.  Is that under the JV and Elvis one that's in the same issue?  Well, they really, really fucked up.  And it's something that radio guys do all the time. 
[04:04:30]  When you do go at it with another show and you don't like what you're hearing,  you'll hit the dump and go, hey, hey.  Man Cow used to do this all the time.  Hey, hey, you're cursing.  I had to dump out of that.  Because they didn't want to hear what you were saying.  Well, Mike backs us up.  Subject.  Now, one curse word from Jimmy.  Are these guys serious?  Way to be team players and respect when one show has something going and giving weight to them.  They would have wanted to do the same exact thing you did if the situation was reversed.  There is no JV in team.  I dropped the F-bomb within the first minute of the conversation. 
[04:05:00]  And then I realized I'm not just yelling at ethnics in my car driving home.  So I stopped cursing after that.  But no one else was cursing after that.  And Jimmy wasn't cursing.  No, I was yelling about something.  You were burying them.  And they had no response.  So they dump and say, oh, Jimmy cursed.  And then come say it to my face.  That's what you say?  That's what your idea?  I'm going to beat you up.  Oh, shut up.  I'll beat you up.  Oh, go shit in your hat. 
[04:05:30]  Go shit in your hat.  That's why you're not in fucking morning.  Yeah.  Why don't you beat up all the other morning guys around the country?  And then you can take their spots while they're in the hospital healing.  I went with the whole board-off thing.  I'm like, oh, all right.  A board-off that's on the side of all the city buses.  A board-off that is a star of a TV commercial.  A board-off that sat on Letterman's couch.  I have to go, boys.  I have a plane.  Kenny's about to say he's calling me because I have a flight.  Oh, I'm actually getting into my vehicle now.  What, Sam?  Hold on.  Sam, this little girl has something to say.  Yeah, what's up, Sam? 
[04:06:00]  They just said that the station manager has told them to stop talking about you guys.  Oh, I'll do what management told you.  That's how, you know.  And I made our names for ourselves by listening to management, you dopes.  You don't even know what good radio is when it hits you in the face.  And I know how much trouble Ant and I got in over the years when management said,  don't do this, don't do that, and we just continued.  They actually yanked us off the air a few times.  And guess what?  It created amazing talk for the radio show.  But you guys are going to be like good little boys because you know you have nowhere else to go, 
[04:06:30]  so you're going to have to listen to management.  So they told you to shut up, and guess what?  You shut up.  And this is the board-off talking.  Let's see them try to, let's see management try to tell us not to mention them tomorrow.  Right, right, right.  We'll talk about whatever the hell we want.  Always have, always will.  It's costed us our jobs a couple times, but we'll continue.  Bye, guys.  Anthony, good luck today, man. 
[04:07:00]  I'll see you Monday, man.  I have to fly because Kenny is outside, and I've got to fucking fly.  I have a good flight.  Yeah, and I'm taking off, too.  Who's left with that show?  Jesus, what time is it?  I don't know.  Oh, you did 10 minutes of overtime.  All right, 11 minutes of bonus time.  That means next week we start coming off XM at 840.  That's right.  All right, sweetie.  I'll see you Monday.  Great job, man.  I'll see you guys.  All right, buddy.  I hope everything works out, man.  All right.  I hope I'll see you Monday, man.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jimmy.  Wait, Jimmy.  I have to do that.  I'm late.  I was supposed to leave like 10.  But I'm scared.  Don't be scared.  I don't know.  I'm scared. 
[04:07:30]  You have boss here.  He'll karate kick anyone.  I never got to do my own show.  I just push the buttons usually.  Put Travis down.  I'm scared.  This kid's got magnetism.  I'm scared.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  Should I continue?  You're sure.  Yeah, why not?  Just plug my gig.  These two?  Sorry.  Sorry.  Jim Norton at the Improv in Pittsburgh all weekend long starting tonight.  Tonight.  All right, we could do line of the day and get out of here.  You guys want to go to noon for us?  Who, me and Bonnie?  You got anything in you? 
[04:08:00]  I'll go out.  I mean, if you want us to, I'll do it.  It's kind of hard to follow.  Yeah, I know.  To follow it.  There was like some amazing radio over at FM and now.  One should be like Rapport and just do like the post-show wrap-up.  All right.  So then there's not much pressure.  You take calls and what you're feeling.  They'll say something and then you can comment and stuff.  All right, cool.  All right, we'll do some post-show.  All right, Bonnie and Rich will be doing the post-show today.  Line of the Day, sponsored by Bodog.  If you want to vote for Line of the Week, go to iliketolisten.com. 
[04:08:30]  iliketolisten.com.  We'll be announcing that tomorrow, I guess, right?  And if you want to learn to play better poker, go to bodog.net.  This thing is sponsored now?  I just realized that.  Bodog is sponsoring Line of the Day.  Okay.  Why don't you listen to the same thing?  All right.  So there's the runner-ups.  How many runner-ups we got today?  One runner-up and one winner.  I know I won today.  The board-up wins Line of the Day.  But I've never said anything funny.  I already know I won. 
[04:09:00]  This is going to be a big party for me.  All right.  Here's the runner-up Line of the Day.  Why don't you listen to the same thing your cousin listened to?  A bullet whizzing in.  I hate my laugh.  That was cute, but here's Line of the Day.  Here comes Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day. 
[04:09:30]  I would have loved to have gone to that wake.  You got the coffin and then a whole hat box to the left.  That's your heart, Opie.  I needed that today because they hurt my feelings over there.  That's hard.  That was about the girl out of nowhere didn't like Kenny Sing and Secret Asian Man thought  we were making fun of retards.  Oh, is that what she thought?  I thought she didn't like retards. 
[04:10:00]  I believe she...  I don't know.  She couldn't believe that we had a retard singing a song.  It bothered her.  And then, uh...  Oh, um...  She said her cousin committed suicide or something.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, so we were...  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, she got mixed up that we were talking about suicide.  Yeah, yeah.  So then Jimmy and everybody went after her and then we just had it.  I said, you know, he blew his head off, so hence the line.  How...  You know, these...  I...  We'll do it in a recap.  These...  By the way, I will take this call because I knew this would happen. 
[04:10:30]  Twinkie from Pal Talk.  What's up, man?  Man, this is bullshit.  I called Free FM when you guys were fucking screaming at each other.  And I called them up and I told them...  I was the one that was screaming in the background that they were full of shit and a bunch of drunks and shit.  That's bullshit.  You guys...  You guys are the king of radio.  What else is there to...  You know?  Well, I don't...  Honestly, I don't need to hear that today.  But what I did want you to do is make sure you got the word out there that they're not taking our calls. 
[04:11:00]  That's how you handle a situation.  You just blow it off.  All righty, man.  Thanks.  Josie, I'm still fat.  Later.  All right.  Thank you, Twinkie.  Why did everyone call me a lazy cunt?  I'm the last man standing here.  Why?  Oh, because you're leaving.  Because now I'm leaving.  God forbid I'm leaving at 11.15.  We're supposed to broadcast until 11.  I think we gave the people five hours of great radio today. 
[04:11:30]  Five hours and 15 minutes.  It was remarkable.  I've never seen Norton get that pissed off and that out of his mind.  That's how mad he was.  Because it gets so frustrating because, you know, these radio guys, they could just, you know, they could just tell whatever lies they want to make themselves look better.  And they obviously told a lot of lies.  But here's the thing.  And then their listeners just believe it as fact.  And when, you know, if they had a discussion with us, we would prove our points no problem.  But here's the thing.  They're in one market.  Tomorrow morning, you're going to go in, or you can go in, and just bust all their lies. 
[04:12:00]  You could play it back.  You could just diffuse.  Honestly, we'd probably just do our show tomorrow.  Yeah, but I'm just saying.  You're in New York with five times or ten times as many listeners in New York, then around the country.  They're crazy.  It's like WB starting a war with NBC.  It's ridiculous.  If anything, they should be kissing your ass. 
[04:12:30]  Wait a minute.  WB is too high up, I think, yeah.  WB starting a war with CBS.  It's like the We Network.  The We Network.  The We Network.  Starting a war with NBC.  Katie Couric would take on who, you think?  I can't think of anything.  I wish I knew a WB show, which it's now CW, right?  Everybody loves CW.  What does CW stand for?  So maybe it would be The Undertaker taking on Katie Couric.  You know, it's whatever.  It's just, you know.  Now, let's really think about that.  Let's do this now. 
[04:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Why am I alone with this ass?  Why am I alone with this dope?  I'm giving a good analogy, a good comparison.  Yeah.  That if anything, if anything, or we have our pride, you know what?  You're prideful.  So it's a what?  It's a TV war now?  No, I'm comparing.  It's a comparison.  A comparison of what?  That we're bigger than them, and it was stupid for them to take us on?  It's like an open mic-er starting a war with a headliner. 
[04:13:30]  With a big national headliner.  It's like a kid starting a war with his parent.  It's like a little baby lamb starting a war with a lion.  Right?  See, you know what I'm saying.  Am I right?  Am I getting it?  You know what I'm saying.  You talk Voss.  That's great.  I promise I don't talk Voss yet.  Oh, my God, Rich.  No, you know what I'm saying.  Listen.  Did you ever fight Marvin Hagler?  It's like a CD starting a war with the nano. 
[04:14:00]  It's like...  When you fought Marvin Hagler.  Listen, thank you, Anthony.  We've walked into a very...  Anthony.  Oh, B, I am so sorry for leaving you.  I'm listening to this, and I wanted to change to JV and Elf.  I swear to you, I apologize so much for leaving you. 
[04:14:30]  I want to...  You sound so distraught.  I want to let people inside my head for a second.  This is how twisted I am.  I knew this would be painful, but for some reason, I wanted to go through the process.  I swear this is my life.  Like, I watch TV shows I hate, and I get pissed off.  I am sitting here out of curiosity to see what this dope will say next.  The WB competing with NBC.  They are.  And he doesn't even, like...  Do they?  Yeah, they do compete. 
[04:15:00]  Good point, Ed.  It's like...  But he doesn't even say it with a smile, like, we're supposed to sit here and be on  the edge of our seat with every word that comes out of his mouth.  It's like Pepsi competing with Coke.  No, no, it's not Pepsi competing with Coke.  It's like that other one, you know?  What other one?  The real cheap one.  Right?  The one that says cola?  Yeah.  I mean, what...  Oh, what a dunk.  Oh, my dear sweet Lord. 
[04:15:30]  You know what he does all the time?  He'll, like...  He will accuse me of making words up.  If I'm just speaking normally, if I use a word...  For proper words, he'll accuse you of making them up.  Yeah.  Yeah, that figures.  Unbelievable.  All right.  All right.  I'm probably going to lose you, so...  Don't stay in there too much longer with him.  I don't want him affecting you.  Yeah, I know what's going to happen.  If I stay in here any longer, I get all the emails. 
[04:16:00]  You know, without Anthony...  Oh, shut up.  Look what I had to work with.  You know, without Anthony, I hope he's nothing.  See, they can't do a show if one of them leaves early.  This is my opportunity to shine.  Help me out here, Henry.  I'm here for you.  Here's what I'm saying.  How you stood up and just buried him.  It was like...  It was gladiator.  It was gladiator again.  You just buried him.  It was like a gladiator against a peasant. 
[04:16:30]  All right.  Where are you going?  You guys want to go to noon?  Yeah.  No.  What are you...  All right.  I guess.  I don't know.  I feel like, you know...  I don't care if you spend a half hour.  I'll be saying we're terrible.  You're not terrible.  Yeah, actually, we got good reviews on what you guys did last time.  Really good reviews.  Yeah, it was fun.  I complained a lot, and I apologize.  We didn't do anything today, either.  We didn't do the T.O. story.  We didn't do the...  Why don't we do some of it now? 
[04:17:00]  Don't go.  Look at me.  Don't go.  All right.  Why not?  What?  Oh, my God.  Do I...  Dan, what do I do?  Why?  What do you have to do?  No, I do.  Break and run.  Break and run.  But you know what JV and Elvis, didn't they say that he was like, yeah, I'm going to tell  them today that we're not going to do it anymore?  Yeah, right.  We got that on tape.  Yeah, so then why did they cave to management when the management said stop talking?  I really don't know.  Well, here's the thing, too, because I remember...  That would have been their... 
[04:17:30]  The first time I went into their studio, like, I was on O&A.  We were on O&A at XM, and then I had to go do JV and Elvis the first time.  So O&A go, oh, we're going to play this, or...  You know, they were playing bits of O&A, I mean, of JV and Elvis that were hacked.  So we went over there.  You were with Mima.  And they go, oh, we heard you were making fun.  And he's...  Before we go in there, he's calling me out.  This guy wants to fight everybody.  Oh, right, right.  But he's going, you know, if you've got a problem, I don't even know you, right?  Right, because you walked into the studio. 
[04:18:00]  He was...  They were trashing Rich, and Rich went into the studio, and they go, no, we're not ready  for you yet.  You know...  He had to wait again.  He's trashing me without even knowing me, you know?  And then he's going, you want to fight?  And then all of a sudden, you know, oh, we...  And then Norton busted him, and he goes, you want to fight?  The guy wants to fight everybody.  His problem is he needs anger management.  That's the problem.  I'm going to...  Yeah.  All right.  Let's email.  I'm going to cut my losses.  Was that one again?  No, come on.  That's a good story.  It was terrific.  Well, what do you want to talk about before you leave?  Anything but that.  Okay. 
[04:18:30]  Do you want to...  No, no, no, no.  You guys are on your own.  No.  Oh, come on.  I got too much to lose if this doesn't go well.  See, I'm funny, right?  Yeah.  Like these.  It's not worth the risk.  You've got to know when to punch out.  Well, we can handle it.  We can take it.  Listen.  See, my stock could go up if I stay and really, really do some funny stuff.  Uh-huh.  But if I fail, it's going to hurt me a lot more.  You know what?  The risk and reward is not worth the reward. 
[04:19:00]  The risk you've got to take.  But we'll handle it because...  All right.  You guys will do the last half hour before Ron and Fez today, okay?  Easily, yeah.  All right.  Guys, it was an amazing show today.  Anthony's drama was amazing.  If you didn't hear it, if you're tuning in now, you might want to listen to the replay today.  He's almost ready to take his meeting and...  Yeah, yeah.  Just say that because we'll keep the radio tees going.  We don't want to tell people the ending before they hear the show.  Oh.  There's a lot of people who don't hear the show until the replay anyway, as far as the  X-Amers go.  Well, guys, thanks.  Thank you for having us today. 
[04:19:30]  All right.  When we get back...  Well, when the show gets back, it'll be you two, all right?  Austin Bonnie next.  Austin Bonnie.  All right.  Cool.  Opie and Anthony.  I've been gangbanging, killing, killing, rob, motherfucker.  Static crack, got my holes in the back.  I don't give a fuck about nobody in this motherfucker.  Let me show your ass, look.  What the fuck I want to do, nigga?  What do I do, nigga?  Huh?  Radio for the Angry Golfer.  The Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
