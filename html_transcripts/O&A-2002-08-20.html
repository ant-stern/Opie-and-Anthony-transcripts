<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion centered on the arrival of Melissa, a new, strikingly attractive female employee at WNEW.  Her appearance, described as resembling a Playboy model, caused significant disruption in the workplace, with the hosts and other on-air personalities extensively commenting on her physical attributes and the resulting distraction among the male staff.  They speculated that her hiring was a deliberate attempt by management, specifically Ken Stevens, to disrupt the show, and jokingly accused Stevens of having a romantic interest in Melissa, even mentioning placing a microphone under his door.  This led to a debate about whether Melissa's presence was a positive or negative influence on productivity and morale.

Following this, the show played a secretly recorded audio of Spaz, a recurring character, giving a heavily intoxicated and poorly received emcee performance at a strip club, resulting in much amusement and mockery from the hosts and callers.  This transitioned into a discussion about a supposed female conspiracy involving body glitter, with Opie suggesting women used it to mark men they had been intimate with.  Listeners called in with anecdotes about encountering unexplained body glitter.

The next segment featured a heated and highly contentious phone call with Andrew Dice Clay, who vehemently accused comedian Jay Moore of stealing his material and performing it on another radio show, allegedly with Anthony's encouragement. This devolved into a shouting match filled with insults and accusations, interspersed with comedic bits like repeated "boogaloo" chants.  Jay Moore was eventually brought on air, escalating the argument further.  The segment also included a discussion about a WWF event sign referencing Dice Clay's catchphrase, further fueling the accusations.  The discussion included Orson Welles outtakes showcasing his frustration during commercial recording sessions.  Later, comedian Jeffrey Ross joined in-studio, briefly commenting on Dice Clay's show and other topics, followed by a call with Bob May, the Robot from *Lost in Space*. May discussed his experiences wearing the costume.

Bob May's call continued into the next segment, with the hosts grilling him about his experiences inside the Robot costume, including anecdotes about eating lunch and smoking inside the suit.  This led to a discussion about past interviews with *Star Wars* actors, highlighting the challenges of finding engaging questions for actors known primarily for their costumed roles. The conversation then took a sharp and offensive turn, focusing on newly released tapes of Richard Nixon and Donald Rumsfeld containing highly offensive racial comments.  The hosts and a caller engaged in a dialogue filled with racial slurs and stereotypes, mirroring the language on the tapes, which continued into a comedic, yet deeply offensive, Nixon impersonation.

The final segment returned to the speculation about Melissa, the new female employee, and her alleged affair with Ken Stevens. This involved a sexually explicit and highly inappropriate role-playing skit detailing graphic sexual encounters between Stevens and Melissa.  A phone call with Ken Stevens followed, where he denied the allegations while engaging in suggestive banter.  The show concluded with a darkly comedic and tasteless recap of Elian Gonzalez's departure from the US, featuring a running gag about Tom Brokaw being high on drugs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I'm not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone,  and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible.  There is. 
[00:00:30]  There is no green and there is no yellow.  Like my signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit, the big nine.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is that mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't suck it up, it will not pleasure.  Suck it up. Walk it off, Zeke.  I love camel toe.  They're shaving for America.  No ass. 
[00:01:00]  I gotta see that ass.  No.  I would definitely be willing to have a sexual deal with people who already had AIDS.  No ass.  I hope he says it isn't bad.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Rude, disgusting, self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah-blah-blah.  Thank God we get back to the end.  Oh, okay, terrific. 
[00:01:30]  Insert joke here.  The handy's great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello?  Pull your pants down.  You got bad eyes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Number three.  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea. 
[00:02:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black. 
[00:02:30]  Well, I'm picked up, Rick.  How are you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Howdy.  Baggins.  Well, can I say it, Big Dick?  You're close.  Give them to me.  Now.  Well, what are you, people?  On the door?  Yes. 
[00:03:00]  What are you?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Hello.  Open for business.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  What's up, Ben?  Today?  Ben's critics.  You know, they criticize Ben's eight-minute show now.  And remember yesterday, some guy chimed in and said, 
[00:03:30]  What's the matter, Ben?  You can't play anything new?  Today, he plays a couple of newer songs.  And now the same guy is going, Oh, what?  You don't like classic rock?  So I believe someone's really effing with Ben.  And it's getting to him, too.  He's like, Man, it's the same guy.  No, it's the same guy.  He changed his little playlist today just because some guy gave him some crap yesterday.  And now, look, see, you're still getting crap. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, you've got to believe in your radio abilities.  Don't let the critics get to you.  Yes.  You know what you're doing.  You're in that seat.  You've got a radio show.  Don't listen to the critics.  Hey, we should take that advice.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  What are we doing today?  Pretty good.  Yeah.  I hope everyone realizes we have a Playboy model working here now.  And it's really effing distracting.  A lot of people getting thrown for a loop by Melissa. 
[00:04:30]  There's this girl, Melissa.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, it would turn gay guys straight.  Yes.  Yes.  This girl's ridiculous.  She doesn't wear a bra.  She's got big, huge boobs.  She wears leather pants, cowboy hats.  Like, who wears cowboy hats to work aside from maybe a stripper?  You know what I mean?  We've been to a lot of strip clubs.  She walks around like when the girls arrive for their shift at a strip club. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  They've got their little bag with them, their little duffel bag.  And they walk past the patrons at the bars.  And you look at them and go, oh, now I've got to nurse this beer another 20 minutes until she hits the stage.  You know?  And that's kind of what she looks like as she's walking through the halls.  And no one can look her in the eye because she's just showing off her cleavage.  No work is getting done.  Yeah.  That's why we're making up this break as we go along.  We didn't even talk about the show today.  We're all in the back office. 
[00:05:30]  Rick, Rick, go to the cop here.  Now, now.  There she is.  There she is.  Check it out.  You're human.  Yeah, let's make believe that we don't look at other women.  What are you, high?  What world does that work where, like, you're married to someone and you just, you know,  you make believe that there's no one out there to check out?  God.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I was busy working over here.  There you go, Rick.  You're a pussy.  She looks like Farrah Fawcett today.  How long have you been married there, Rick? 
[00:06:00]  Uh, almost a year and a half.  Yeah?  You used that George Foreman grill yet?  Yes, we have, Anthony, and it really saves time.  And I didn't even pick that out.  And the picture of Melissa is up on WNEW.com.  You just click on the WOW sticker, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you smell her?  What?  No, I didn't smell her.  You can't help it.  She had all this perfume on her.  What are you doing?  He's talking about not looking.  No, I don't do that.  Did you smell her?  What the hell are you doing? 
[00:06:30]  But we're all taking turns leaving the office to get a peek, making believe we have business  down the hall.  We never leave our office.  And I'm pissed off.  I even took somebody else's fax.  You took someone else's...  Oh, boy.  It's about time we have something to look at around here.  You know what I'm saying?  There's a hot chick around here that is really distracting everyone, and I just want to say  it on the air.  And I want Ken in here, our boss, because this is very suspicious.  Oh, I've got to tell you something else, too.  What? 
[00:07:00]  Last night, I'm watching the videotape of the XFL pregame, which was delivered.  Yes.  You had already left.  I didn't want to look at it.  So I was screening the tape.  I left here about, I guess it was quarter after eight or so, a little after eight.  As I'm leaving, Ken Stevens is coming into the elevator, or leaving the elevator I was  getting into to leave, coming back to the office from somewhere at a quarter after eight 
[00:07:30]  last night.  What's that all about?  Something's up.  This is very suspicious.  And I've never seen him come back to this station that late, ever.  Matter of fact...  Looked like he had a few in him, too.  I'll tell you that much.  Matter of fact...  Yeah.  Let me say something else about Ken Stevens.  All right.  Is this the first week he's been here all week?  Mm-hmm.  Correctamundo, in the words of Arthur Fonzarelli. 
[00:08:00]  Our big boss, Ken, he doesn't like this place.  He's babysitting this place.  He's usually here two days a week.  But this week, hot, playboy chick walking around.  He's been here every day.  Mm-hmm.  I go, Ken, you flying out today?  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no.  A lot of business to tend to here at N.E.W.  No, no, no, no.  I got stuff to do.  Meetings, meetings.  Yeah.  I really, you know, looked at the N.E.W. situation, assessed it, and think it requires a little more  of my time.  I'll be here every day and night working.  There is something going on, and we're going to get to the bottom of it. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, we'll tell you.  Because I haven't even seen her do any work, and no one cares.  Yeah.  Has she done anything?  No.  She doesn't do anything.  She just walks around looking good with her little cowboy hat, wearing sunglasses inside.  They're like Jennifer Lopez hot sunglasses.  I actually...  Belly button.  Huge freaking handlebars on her ears.  Opie.  Oh, my God.  I slipped a mic under Ken's door. 
[00:09:00]  You did?  Also, when he got back.  And I don't know if he was in there alone, but I got some audio of him.  Do I make you horny?  Yeah, baby.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What the hell is going on in that office?  Something's going on. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to know if you guys remember that sexual harassment talk you got a couple  of months ago.  I am so glad you brought that up, because she's hotter than any girl we've ever had on the  show.  Any other lady that works here at WNEW.  And I'm thinking, my God, I think they're setting us up for a big fall here, because they  know we're going to have to talk about her.  There is something else going on here.  And she is an employee. 
[00:10:00]  Well, I'm sure she's a big girl and she knows the business, but you guys are already playing  the line.  You don't need any temptation.  No, we don't need the temptation.  She wants us to want her.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  She wants us to want her.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  What?  Have fun with her, fellas.  Get Ken on the phone.  You want Ken on the phone?  Yeah, is he back from lunch?  Let me get a check.  Oh, those lunches are probably getting a little longer, too.  He left for lunch at 11.30.  It's now 3.15.  Is he going to come back with an ice cream cone like the old boss? 
[00:10:30]  Or will he have something else in his mouth?  Hey.  What the hell is going on?  I don't know.  There's something, because you just don't hire girls like this to walk around the office.  It distracts the workers in the work environment.  I'm going to try to get Ken on the air.  Scott, what's up?  Guys, how are you?  Good.  I think the hot chick in the workplace actually goes through a three-phase process. 
[00:11:00]  First is there's a distraction phase, which you guys are going through right now, where  no work gets done.  Wait, and I've got to slow you down.  There's a reason we're distracted, because she's showing off everything.  Yeah, it's not just like...  She wants you to look.  Wait, there are girls in the workplace that you just know under their little outfits there.  They're really hot, but they're not really flaunting anything.  Yeah.  This girl is walking around flaunting it all.  She wants eyes to be there.  No question.  There's more skin showing on her body than clothing.  And that's good for you. 
[00:11:30]  Phase two is the morale-boosting phase, where you're going to get there about...  You're just going to find yourself to start getting about 10 in the afternoon, 12.  Yeah.  The morale is up, because you want to be there to see this chick.  Scott, we didn't work on our show today.  We were too busy being like guys back in like junior high school going, dude, dude, dude,  go to the copy machine.  And eventually, though, there's the third phase, which is the acceptance phase, where you realize  that you don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting in this chick's pants. 
[00:12:00]  It's not even about that.  I don't even care.  It's just something is up, and we want to get to the bottom of it.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Good luck to you.  Thanks, Scott.  Yeah, Ken, it seems, is still out to lunch.  Interesting.  Where's Melissa?  I think she went out to lunch.  All right.  Interesting.  Okay.  Could be nothing.  Why'd she go to lunch?  She didn't do anything.  I don't know.  Tom, what's up?  Tom, yeah, that's basically all she did at YSP in Philadelphia. 
[00:12:30]  She walked around looking hot.  Every time they had a promotional thing, she was there.  She sits there, signs, autographs, comes with pictures.  So her job is to just be hot?  Yeah.  Yeah, because they did get her from YSP in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  So this guy knows a little something about her.  When I said it was Melissa, I knew who it was.  I mean, she's smoking.  So her whole job is just to look hot?  Her job is to have you boys walk around with hard arms all day. 
[00:13:00]  All the job.  Well, how is that going to make us work harder?  It's going to tease the hell out of you all day.  You're going to be at work every day.  You're not going to be late or anything.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good one.  I think they're taking the lead that we've always took here.  Whenever there is conflict or controversy, we've noticed that boobs always help out.  And chicks, right?  That might be what they have in store for us.  Jason?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm thinking management is using your plan against you.  Like, I was just saying, whenever you guys got a problem in the studio, bam, you bust out the boobs and everything's fine. 
[00:13:30]  You guys were talking about, you know, like how some of the DJs don't like each other and whatnot.  You know, you bring in boobs, everyone forgets that.  You might have a point.  You might be on to something.  What does she actually do there?  Does she have a job?  We don't know.  Jason, she's been here all week.  She's been on most of the radio shows.  I don't know what she does.  She changes outfits on an hourly basis.  Yeah.  She walks around with, like, a hot, like, stripper cowboy hat on. 
[00:14:00]  She sounds like more of a studio whore than Psycho Mark.  Yesterday, she had no bra on.  Jesus.  Yesterday, no bra, full D's, cleave it.  Her shirt was unbuttoned all the way down to her belly button and tied right there.  Like, wow.  You know what?  She starts coming in in a bikini and just walking around the studio.  She might as well.  Opie, I found out why Pete couldn't fix my microphone.  He is busy installing a pole in the lobby. 
[00:14:30]  There's going to be a pole installed in the lobby.  I don't know what.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WNAW.  Let's give a big hand right now, making her way to the studio, Melissa.  Come on, people.  Give it up for Melissa.  You may recognize her as a former employee of WYSP.  Now she's here with us at NAW. 
[00:15:00]  Give her a big hand, Melissa.  Hey, Anthony, why isn't Fez joining us?  Swing it on the phone, pop, swing it on the door.  Swing it where we want, cause I hate a lot.  Yeah, give her your support and money, people.  Her new job here at NAW, be hot.  That's the job description.  And boy, she is as she makes her way to the pole.  Oh, the pole just broke, cause Pete had stalled it.  Yeah, it's bizarre. 
[00:15:30]  That is a strange job to have.  Yeah.  Your job is to be hot.  Be hot.  That's all we know so far.  I'll tell you one thing.  It forced us to talk to that Dan the Man guy.  Useless marketing guy.  Dan the Man.  Are we talking to him now?  Why are we talking to him?  Cause now there's a hot chick.  Hot chick in his office.  That's the only reason, Dan the Man.  Don't think we like you now.  They're using ONA tactics on us. 
[00:16:00]  Backfiring.  Right, Stink?  Stink.  What do you think of this whole situation?  Everyone's talking about it.  Cause we're like, what does she do?  Oh yeah, I get up and walk around for no reason.  For the same, you know, just like you guys.  Oh, I gotta check something in the studio.  You know, you just walk around.  Yeah.  I was printing up an email from listeners.  I don't care about the listeners.  I'm printing them up like, oh, I gotta read all the emails.  Like you get them on your screen, O.B. 
[00:16:30]  Why you gotta print them out?  They've had to reload the printer three times today with paper.  There's just blank pieces of paper shooting out.  I don't know.  People are printing out things like cartoons from the paper.  Very important document here.  That says, I'm with stupid.  Very important.  I had to make 50 of these based on various persons' backs.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  What are you, a tool?  You're gonna get this girl fired. 
[00:17:00]  How often do you get a hot piece of ass walking around your office?  You know something, though?  She's not gonna get fired.  Ken hired her.  Ken hired her to do nothing.  Mm-hmm.  And we're okay with that as long as Ken will admit that.  Isn't that funny?  Earl does nothing and we make a big deal out of it.  Well, Earl's got nice boobs, though.  Oh.  Stop that.  Ouch.  Ouch.  So, that's that, I guess.  Hopefully we'll get Ken on the air. 
[00:17:30]  She's got her little Western number on.  No, she's doing the Farrah Fawcett slash Jennifer Lopez hot sunglass thing.  Oh, the sunglass thing today?  With, did you see the heels she's wearing?  The spiked heels?  Really?  She had shoes on?  I didn't know.  Frank, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Dude, the same thing happened in my workplace, right?  Like, one of the bosses got fired, so they just rehired this girl.  She was like 22 or something.  Yeah.  Like, same thing, like a nice rack and everything. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Dude, she does nothing.  She walks around the place and she's considered the new assistant.  That's it.  That's all she does.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  She gets paid to walk around and look hot.  That's all she does, man.  Yeah, Ope, how do you get fired if your job is to be hot and you're being hot?  You know, she ain't gonna get fired.  I don't know, man.  All I know is that the bosses talk about, uh...  It just seems like an easy job.  I wish I could have went to college to get the job to be hot.  Ope, sorry.  Seems like you don't do much. 
[00:18:30]  How do you learn how to be hot?  Maybe at the bar that Marco goes to, the cock down in the village.  But how does someone learn how to be hot?  I don't know.  You gotta pick up the fashion mags, I guess.  She was telling us yesterday that she was hired to just sit in the millionaire who wants  to be a millionaire audience.  In the audience.  That's right.  I like looking at, uh, boobs.  Naked women.  Come on.  I stared at that Kathy Lee for so long, it drove me crazy. 
[00:19:00]  Now we hire hot girls to sit in the audience.  I love it!  So, that's where we're at.  And Ken's still not back from lunch.  And Rick, you're a pussy for not admitting you're looking at her.  He's smelling her.  He's too busy smelling her not to, uh, look at her.  Did you smell her?  What?  What are you, a cock a spaniel?  I'm, I'm...  A little secret guys look.  And, ooh, girls look too. 
[00:19:30]  You know?  Yeah, but no matter how you slice it, dude.  Linda's gonna make me seem wrong.  I'll always be wrong for doing it.  You signed up for that when you got married, my friend.  That's her job.  You're wrong.  Anything.  You will be wrong.  All right, we gotta take a break.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Don't go to, uh, CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.

[00:26:30]  You're doing schtick  Oh, my God  They're just lonely guys that want to see some poontang  Imagine you're on the street  You want to see some gash and some boobs  And you walk into a place  And you don't see that  You're paying money for your beers  What do you say?  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey, I must really be a Spaz  Thank you 
[00:27:00]  You know, I really must be a Spaz  If I can't get a microphone cord untangled  Anyway  Here's a dumb question  Anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  Absolutely no response  God, we didn't have one listener there  Come on  Come on  God, Spaz, you got drawing power  I must say  I'm unadvertised  You know, we say we're going to be somewhere  We get 2,200 people to show up  Spaz  Oh, no, advertise

Not one listener was there 
[00:28:00]  Why are they paying you?  They pay you so you would bring people down  Not to entertain the staff  I feel if I was promoted  Oh my God  Promoted  Alright, so he didn't get a reaction answer  Now he starts screaming at the crowd  Good, good  Here we go  I said, did anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  Morant!  Morant!

Hey people, how we doing?  Come on!  Come on!  How we doing?  Come on!  He didn't get a reaction  So he decides to yell  What do you think?  No one heard you?  Well, I just thought that there was maybe a dramatic pause or something 
[00:29:00]  A traumatic pause  Here it is, hey, listen  I said, did anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  Alright, a couple  Now he dragged it out of two people  It was a pretty disgusting show  We had a couple of psychos  Who I'm actually hanging out with tonight  Who actually ate mice today  Mice  Ate mice live on the air  Mice  It's rats, you idiot  I thought they were the same thing  You thought mice and rats were the same thing?

[00:44:00]  Yeah it's the ONA show  Lots to do today  We'll get into all that  In just a bit here  You know what  I have a conspiracy theory  That rivals anything  From the X-Files 
[00:44:30]  Anthony before you start this  Yeah  405 update  Ken Stevens  Still out to lunch  Check him for body glitter  When he gets back  Here's my theory  Rivals the X-Files  Conspiracies  Every woman  In at least this country  Got together somehow  On a secret woman network  I think it's over the internet  Can you find that  On the WWW thing  On that WWW thing  I don't know where it is  The guys can't access this 
[00:45:00]  It's a code  That they've all spread around  And kept very secret  And there was this  Huge invention  Called body glitter  Came out a few years back  This stuff is like  When they used to  Tag the animals  On Wild Kingdom  Cause  If you ever come home  With body glitter on you  There is no effing way  You can make an excuse for it  You were in contact  With a woman  Wearing body glitter  In some way  Shape or form  How you handle that contact 
[00:45:30]  Is another thing  How you get out of that  But there's no saying  I did not have contact  With a woman  That had body glitter on  There's gotta be other ways  To get body glitter on you  Let me think  A body glitter truck  Exploded right next to me  Holy Christ  I'm lucky to be alive  You come on with body glitter  There's no doubt  What you were up to  You gotta have  I'm not even saying  You were doing anything  But the fact is  Now your excuse  Isn't gonna be  No one was near me  With body glitter  No one touched me 
[00:46:00]  With body glitter  Now you have to come up  With an excuse  As to why you have it  On you  And the only thing is  A girl touched you  With body glitter on  You get these strip clubs  You used to just have to  Worry about  Whore smell  That perfume sweat thing  That they wear so well  And portions of that  Of course you know  Can be washed off  You can never wash off  A body glitter entirely  You could do whatever you want  There will still be  All of a sudden  You're walking in the kitchen 
[00:46:30]  Or somewhere  You're getting yourself a drink  You turn just right  In that light  Bling  Bling  Bling bling  A lighthouse effect  Of body glitter  Shines in our eyes  What  What's that?  So you think  It's a conspiracy  The women have  Figured out a way now  To track us  To tag us  When you're around  Alien women  With this body glitter  Just a fair warning  Just giving it out there  That's all 
[00:47:00]  Lisa has a story  Lisa  Hey, Lisa  Oh, I am actually cold  What?  What?  I feel cold  Because this is so scary  Why?  My boyfriend came home  With glitter  Saturday night  And I was suspicious  And you're just  Making me crazy right now  I'm gonna  Oh my god  Anne, what did he say?  Anne, I hope you're not  Ruining it for all the men  Dude, how could this  Ruin anything  If you come home  With body glitter  Guys, they're all  Pissed at us now  Mike, why getting us  Men in trouble  With this  Dude, how do you  Come home with body glitter  And I'm not exposing 
[00:47:30]  Anything other than  If you come home  With body glitter  But maybe the fine ladies  That listen to our show  Weren't thinking that  Until you just  Put it in their heads  See, Lisa  Alright, Lisa  What did you think  And what did he say  When you noticed  Body glitter on him?  Oh, he told me  His sister had  Borrowed his car  Okay  So  Oh my god  You're gonna make me  Try and stop  That's a hot one  Wrong  Try again, dumbass  And he was smelling 
[00:48:00]  Extra fresh too  And I thought  That was suspicious  Because that's  The part of the car  See  You have to come up  With some excuse  You know  Dude  It was in his hair  Too  He has a little Caesar  And I saw it  When I got up  In the morning  I saw it in his hair  Now for you guys  That are pissed  At me for saying this  Go F  Because I'm helping  Your asses right now  Because if this  Happens to you  You are gonna need  A story  To run with 
[00:48:30]  So you think  This out now  Don't come up  With your sister  Borrowed the car  Either  He said  The sister  Because we went  For brunch  The next morning  I saw it  In the passenger seat  So his sister  Had borrowed the car  And apparently  According to him  Picked up some  Of her girlfriends  And maybe they had  On body glitter  That is so lame  I am  I am  Freaking right now  Because I blew it  It's just a little nudge  But when you said it  I went cold 
[00:49:00]  Now we're having fun  Were you buying that though?  I actually was  Yeah  I see  Okay  See  It's exactly what I said though  There's nothing  You have to now  Come up with an excuse  As to why you have it on  It's not just going to get  Passed over  So I'm not  I'm not  Letting any secrets  Out of the bag here  All I'm saying is  If you go home with it  You're going to have to  Have a damn good excuse  Because she's going to notice  And you're going to be effed  And it was on my skin too  Because when I got up 
[00:49:30]  In the morning  Because I don't  I'm like those little  Bohemian chicks  I don't wear any of that crap  And I saw a little glitter  On my skin  I saw it in his hair  See  You see this  That was the glitter  From the whore  That he was with  Yes  I'm helping you  And I said to him  You don't smell of alcohol  How about that  You know he told me  And I actually believe  Is that if you drink  A lot of soda  After you drink alcohol  You don't smell it  Because he was  Hanging with the boys  Hanging with the boys  With body glitter  What was he hanging with  The village people

[01:32:30]  Kathy Lee  Right  Years gone by  And that was their goal  With this whole  Decision process  Oh absolutely  I mean I don't think  He walked though  But I mean  It was pretty funny  For him to actually  Say that though  Alright  She does  She looks like  The young Kathy Lee  Before the gift  Stuck that half deflated  Party balloon in there  And fouled her  With that thing  Oh my god  When he got to use  A tamping rod  On either side  Just to get it working  Aged by osmosis 
[01:33:00]  He destroyed her  She was hot  When she was  Kathy Lee Epstein  Or something  Miss America  Or whatever she was in  One of those  Miss something things  I never got it myself  And she kind  No she kind of had  That girl next door  Wholesome look  When she first started  With Regis  She was pretty ugly  But then when she  Got ravaged  By that  Oh my god  Just nasty  Ancient sack  Slapping against  Her knees  Gif  What just fell off  The bed  My sack

[01:34:00]  Disturbed  Decrepid bat wing  He could stretch that out  Like a party tent  He could hold a prom party  Underneath that sack  That's not tea bagging  Wee  Alright  That's right  I saw the gif once  In the uh  In the bathroom  At live  With Regis and Kathy Lee  And uh 
[01:34:30]  I gotta tell ya  You ever see  One of those balloons  That come down  After the helium runs out  You don't know  Where it came from  It just all of a sudden  It lands on your lawn  And it's all wrinkled  And half deflated  Gif sack  Like an old  Oriental dried  Shiitake mushroom  Shriveled stem  Use a stick  Poke it in  Alright  Let's take a break  We'll be back  Now let's turn on 
[01:35:00]  The PA system  And start the fun  The Opie and Anthony show  Afternoon radio  This is it  You can't go anywhere else  Nowhere to go  That's like saying  You don't like earth  You're leaving  Where are you gonna go  Opie and Anthony  And we finally have control  Yes  Gets better every day  Don't it  MW  I can understand  Swimming with the dolphins  But why are you  Swimming with a fork  Ron and Fez  Weeknight at 7  After Opie and Anthony  1027  WNAW 
[01:35:30]  We got something 
[01:36:00]  Kind of interesting  Yes  I gotta give Rick  The credit for this one  He stumbled upon  Some Orson Welles  Outtakes  We all know  Who Orson Welles  Is by now  Orson Welles  Famous actor  Of course  And I think  The last few things  He did that we remember  Was  They shall serve  No wine  Before it's time  Remember that guy  Big and fat  And he was always  On the Dean Martin roasts  He had a killer  Killer voice 
[01:36:30]  He did radio  Obviously  War of the Worlds  War of the Worlds  That was his biggie  He  First radio prank  I think ever  He got on the air  And said that  Martians landed  My God  How stupid were people  He got on the air  And said Martians  Had landed in New Jersey  And  Were taking over the world  Or at least Jersey  There were people  That jumped out of their windows  Oh yeah  Citizen Kane  Of course  He did  Did a UFO  Take out the mayor  Do you remember 
[01:37:00]  Where he said  The ship landed  In Jersey  Somewhere in Jersey  Grover's Mill  Grover's Mill  Very good  That's right  Very good  There you go  Well  Rick stumbled upon  Some Orson Welles  Outtakes  Yeah  This is pretty damn funny  You'd think Casey  Was a tool  Is that Don on the phone  Hi  I'm Casey Kasem  A little dog  Nate  God damn  How the hell  Am I supposed to come out  Of an up-tempo number  Hi  You know  Like this  So here's Orson Welles  He's trying to do 
[01:37:30]  A commercial read  Obviously Anthony  Everyone's heard  Our outtakes  Here's Orson Welles  And his outtakes  Orson Welles  He just gets very ornery  And he's talking to the guy  In the control room  That probably makes  About four bucks an hour  Well back then  Probably like 75 cents  Oh my god  Really  Probably made nothing  While Orson Welles  Is making all that dough  And he's just giving this guy  A hard time  And it was 10 times harder  Because it was all tape  And stuff  No digital workstations  To just punch it in  Cut and paste  Is that the old razor blade trick  Where you cut out 
[01:38:00]  The and paste it together  Oh yeah  That's how they did it  I remember watching you do that man  That was like an art  Hope used to do that  At a BAB all the time  And it's like  Oh how much time left  20 seconds  And you're still editing tape  Cutting out words on tape  Right  And then taping  The two ends together  That's how they used to do it  It was a pain in the ass  So when Orson Welles  Screws up this read  That means they had to start over  Yep  Over and over and over  Can't just hit  You know delete  And then start over again  Like they do on the computer work  Yeah I'll punch you in  Yeah punch you in 
[01:38:30]  I'll punch you in the face  Here we go  Here's Orson Welles  And the killer voice  Nothing is more important  Than the simple act  Of getting together  Could I have just one more take  Of that  Why  I just did it right  Why the hell  Are you asking me  For another one  Well I felt there was  A slight donk  And I would just like  To be safe  Jesus  I take directions  From one person  Under protest  But for two  I don't sit still  But who the hell  Are you anyway  No I'm the engineer  This is a lot of 
[01:39:00]  You know this  You want one more  Yes  Wow  Man  I gotta hear  Oh man  I gotta hear the first part again  Where he goes  Why  I did it right  The first time  I think he screwed it up though  Yeah he did screw it up  He slurred a word right  Yeah  Nothing is more important  Than the simple act  Of getting together  You could have just one more take  Of that  Why  I just did it right  Why  I just did it right  No you didn't  You slurred the word  Listen 
[01:39:30]  Nothing is more important  Than the simple act  Of getting together  You could have just one more take  Of that  Why  I just did it right  Of getting together  Of getting together  People, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  People.  Yeah.  Maybe engineering.  He screwed up.  Well, he screwed up.  All right.  Let's go.  Why?  I did it right.  I did it right.  Martians in Grover's Mill.  What's happening?  Ray guns.  All right.  This next one, man.  Does anyone know what he's doing a read for with this one?  I think it's like frozen peas or something. 
[01:40:00]  Frozen peas.  Yeah.  I'm a whore.  Frozen peas.  My bank account's a little low.  He's talking about frozen peas, and, man, he gets really picky with this.  I'm into my character.  And the thing is, if it sounds a little weird, like you don't know why he's referring to,  well, we're over whatever, like talking about what he's seeing, it's because when they did  these types of commercials, TV commercials, they had to lay the voice after they shot the  picture. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  So he could see what he's, you know.  Right.  So they would show the commercial in front of him, and as he saw it, he would voice it  and say the appropriate things in the appropriate place.  Right.  And they wanted the words to match the picture.  Right.  Right.  Here's Orson Welles.  Orson Welles.  Orson Welles.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  Do you really mean that?  Yes.  So in other words, I'd start half a second late.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow? 
[01:41:00]  Isn't that the fun of it?  It's, if you can make it almost when that shot disappears, it'll make money.  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say every July, peas grow there.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  We aren't even in the fields, you see.  Yeah, we aren't.  We're talking about him growing and she's picked him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:30]  That's about the most funny Orson Welles we'll ever get.  I think he just cracked a joke.  He's trying to match the audio with the video.  He's talking about growing peas.  And on the screen, she's already picked them.  But she's already picked them.  And then flying saucers come down.  Ray God.  Listen again.  See?  Here we are.  We're talking about him growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what? 
[01:42:00]  In July.  I don't understand you then.  When must, what must be over for July?  When we get out of that snowy field.  When I was out, we were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, always.  I'm always past that.  You are.  Yes.  Well, that's about what I say in July.  You emphasize a bit in, in July.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with in and emphasize it. 
[01:42:30]  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July.  It'll go down on you.  That's just it.  Wait, what was the curse?  Yeah, why did he say that?  What was the curse he said?  He said, and I'll go down?  He said, yeah, I'll go down.  Wow.  Get me a jury.  Go back a couple seconds.  In July.  In July.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July. 
[01:43:00]  It'll go down on you.  That's just idiotic if you'll forgive me if I say so.  That's just stupid.  In July.  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  What?  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking.  Wilson, tell me just one last word.  Yeah?  It was my fault.  I said in July.  If you can leave every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  Your friend.  Every July?  He likes his friends. 
[01:43:30]  So after the show.  No, you don't really mean every July.  It is.  But that's a bad copy.  It's in July.  Of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Norway.  Fish fingers in Norway.  Findus, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals.  There, Janstor, Stengland.  F***ed.  Traction more on that shoals thing.  Because you roll it around very nicely.  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  You don't know what I'm up against. 
[01:44:00]  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical.  But they're tough on the air.  You see?  This is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  What a prick, man.  Oh, my God.  What a prick.  Can you imagine being the guy that's got to run that tape?  The poor engineer.  The poor engineer.  Well, saying that to you?  Yes.  What are you talking about?  You incompetent.  The...  In the fjords.  In the fjords.  Ah, yes. 
[01:44:30]  The fjords.  There are flying saucers.  Little men.  Green men.  Rega.  What did you say in?  And emphasize in.  I'll bend you over and butt slam you.  If you could show me.  Get me a jury.  Your friend.  Get me a jury.  Get me a jury.  And another scotch.  I was hammered the complete 20 last years of my life.  There's more.  Is that Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see? 
[01:45:00]  How am I supposed to go into a commercial about peas with flying saucers landing?  What a dick.  Here's some more.  Because Fiendas frees the cart at sea and then add a crumb crisp coating.  That's tough.  Crumb crisp coating.  I think, no, because of the way it's written, you need to break it up.  Because it's not as conversationally written. 
[01:45:30]  What?  Take crumb out.  Good.  Here under protest is beef burgers.  We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.  This is a lot of s**t, you know.  You want one more?  Yes.  You missed the first beef, actually.  Women missed it. 
[01:46:00]  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef.  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July.  Come on, fellas.  You're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  When you do this, it's impossible.  Orson, you did six last year, and by far and away the best.  And I know the reason.  The right reading for this is the one I'm giving it.  I've been 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made.  You're such p**ts.  Now, what is it you want in your depths of your ignorance? 
[01:46:30]  What is it you want?  Oh, man.  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver because I just don't see it.  That was absolutely fine.  It really was.  You can listen to me.  No money is worth it.  Wow.  He left.  He walked.  Throws his headphones off.  Gigs off.  He walked.  That's hot, man.  On the American farm, the finest beef is chopped up and hacked like I'm going to hack up these engineers. 
[01:47:00]  The depths of your ignorance.  The depths of your ignorance.  Your pests.  Pests.  What a prick.  Hey, Randy, what's going on?  How you doing?  Yeah, that's quite a vision there in my head, chopping up beef.  Boy, you want to get that across on a commercial, huh?  That's appetizing.  He hacks up the cows.  You know, I'm listening to you guys and I'm going, God, I know this voice.  I know it's Orson Welles, but I know it from something else.  And I'm going, that's the brain on Pinky and the Brain in the cartoon. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  That's him.  Yeah, we're getting instant feedbacks from that, too, that says Pinky and the Brain, they did this almost verbatim.  I mean, God, it's exactly the attitude, the voice, everything.  Yeah, they had him in a recording studio doing the same thing.  But it's Orson Welles.  What a prick.  Hey, Ron, what's going on?  Rom, Ron, what's your name?  Ron, are you going to talk or just sit there like a pest?  Perhaps flying saucers came down and green men abducted him. 
[01:48:00]  They have ray guns.  I don't know what to do.  Ron?  Why can't he find better copy?  Ray, what's...  Say press and emphasize, get me a jury.  I'll bend you over and screw.  Green peas.  I love that, man.  Can I hear where he goes, but I did it right the first time. 
[01:48:30]  I did it right.  Get that on again.  Every July.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of people getting together.  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Why?  Why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight donk, and I would just like to be safe. 
[01:49:00]  Jesus.  I take directions from one person under protest, but for two I don't sit still.  But who the hell are you anyway?  No, I'm the engineer.  This is a lot of s***, you know.  You want one more?  Yes.  I take direction from one person under protest.  Arthur, what's going on? 
[01:49:30]  You know, the funny thing is this drunken buffoon that you're listening to probably made the greatest American film ever.  Citizen Kane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's incredible how far he could fall.  Yeah, but then, you know, at the end of his career, there he was on the roasts, the Dean Martin roasts.  Oh, forget about it.  He had a tuxedo the size of a circus tent.  Let me tell you.  Hey, what was the movie Orson Welles did, Evil, in the title? 
[01:50:00]  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil, yeah.  What an unbelievable movie that was.  It's pronounced Evil.  Evil.  Touch of Evil.  I don't know if this guy just drank gala wine to numb his brain, but I don't know how he fell so far.  Yeah, well, there you go.  Get a jury.  Get a jury.  Find out how.  If you find out how I fell so far, I'll give you a Cleveland steamer.  All right, Arthur.  Complete with undigested green peas.  Green peas. 
[01:50:30]  Every July.  Every July, I look in my toilet and see corn and green peas.  Sometimes an errant strand of broccoli, Rob.  After those Saturday nights with Dean Martin, my bowl would look like someone used a salad shooter.  My ass looks like chopped up, well-fed beef. 
[01:51:00]  Wonderful.  But I did it right.  But I did it right.  I'm going to hear that all night long.  Talking about.  But I did it right.  Pests.  Did it right the first time.  Don't have to take this.  There's the bowl.  Yes, and if we go to the orange groves in this Southern California orange orchard, you'll see the two of these put together look like my old sack. 
[01:51:30]  Why can't I talk about my sack?  They look like the oranges.  What do you know?  Idaho russet potatoes.  That's what my sack looks like.  Complete with eyes.  Wonderful.  Why does my ass look like Yucca Flats after the blast?  After a weekend with Dean Martin, Gary Lewis, Bing, and some peas. 
[01:52:00]  One day we were all tanked up in Vegas watching Sinatra, and I believed I saw a flying saucer land and shoot ray guns.  I don't care if this isn't pertinent to the copy.  Wait, look, I'll scratch my butt crack.  Look, it looks like Brie.  I'm ripping off playing. 
[01:52:30]  Wonderful.  Disgusting fat horse and wells, the final years.  I was served no ass cheese before it's time.  God, I've got to take a dump, you insolent, limey bastard.  I will not take direction from you.  I do it under protest.  I've got to take a dump.  Opie, run a knife over my fat body. 
[01:53:00]  It makes me hot.  No, it's all right.  Please.  No, it's okay, man.  Goddamn, my dump looked like leftover beef wellington.  With fine chopped beef.  From a cow, I slammed over the head with a sledgehammer to make these fine burgers.  Mr. Wells, what happens?  Appetizing, isn't it?  I rip its throat out with my own teeth.  What happens if I find a jury?  Find a jury, I'll give you the wheelbarrow. 
[01:53:30]  Roll me in flower, look for the wet spot, violate me.  Orson Welles.  Speaking of greens, toss my salad.  Just toss my salad.  Why?  I did it right the first time.  Nothing I like than crapping out a heapin' helpin' of rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat. 
[01:54:00]  Why is it the San Francisco treat?  I thought that was a fag.  For this show is S.  Bravo.  Let's take a break.  Okay, you guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes, we'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch. 
[01:54:30]  This is stopping by for a little visit today.  Oh yeah, look at this.  Hickory dickory doo.  I ain't written a new joke since 82.  Oh!  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  How are you?  I'm great.  You have the worst luck, and I'll tell you why.  You always show up the day after Ant and I do some just incredible, you know, blowout show the night before.  So we're just hungover, tired.  That's all you need, fresh blood. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  Fresh attitude.  We're so vulnerable when you come in.  Definitely.  Because you always catch us when we're hungover.  You don't look too bad.  We don't look bad?  He looks like crap.  Like 3.30, yeah.  I was up so late.  Why, you went to the dice show?  Well, we hosted the dice show.  He gave us some time up there, Jeffrey.  I was with Don Barris, one of his opening acts at 3 in the morning, getting wasted.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton, did he go on too?  Oh yeah.  Jim Norton killed.  Jim Norton killed.  Norton's very funny.  Funny guy.  I was at Game 5 of the World Series. 
[01:55:30]  You were there?  Yeah.  Oh, I wasn't.  Yeah, it was really exciting, man.  It was really cool.  How are you doing?  It's exciting if you're a Yankee fan.  You know what?  Yeah, people hate hearing this, but I really love the Mets and the Yankees.  You're one of those guys.  I saw a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.  I rooted for the Yankees.  I was at Shea last night.  The Mets were down.  I rooted for the Mets.  What's wrong with that?  New York, New York.  They named it twice.  You got to commit to a team.  Yeah, you really got to commit.  It was all about committing to a team for the subway series. 
[01:56:00]  I would get pissed when I'd walk down the street and you'd see a store that says,  Go Yanks.  And then in the other window, Go Mets.  Come on.  Make the choice.  Oh, we got to talk to Brewer owes me $1,000, by the way.  Yeah.  Is Brewer calling us today?  I don't know.  He was too drunk last night.  Yeah, Brewer called us really late.  He wasn't in his box seats.  That was weird.  It's shit.  No, he's in like Montreal or something.  Oh, yeah.  I usually see him in his box seats.  He's got tickets.  Jeffrey, we get back to the station like 1230 after the Dice show, after watching the  rest of the game. 
[01:56:30]  And we're just getting our stuff to go our own ways and stuff.  My phone rings and it's Brewer just hammered from Montreal talking about the Mets.  And he promised he would call us today, but I don't know what's going on with that.  We got to bump you for a minute.  No, you can actually help us.  We got to talk to the robot from Lost in Space.  Oh, my God.  Can I get some calls?  Is it the actual robot?  No, it's the guy.  It's Bob May, everyone.  Bob May.  You're on, Bob.  Hello there.  How you doing, Bob?  Pretty good.  Who is this?  Anthony?  Both of us are here, Anthony and Opie. 
[01:57:00]  All right, Opie.  Yeah.  Now, you guys are coming over to see our show, I hope.  Oh, get the plug in right away.  You're damn right.  I'm not going to fool around, you see, because my big friend is Big Kev.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, I mean, he's very good with all the stars in Hollywood.  Wait, I've just been informed you're not even the voice guy.  You're just the guy.  All right, now, wait.  Let me explain everything.  You're just the guy that was in the robot?  No, a guy.  Listen to this.  Wait a minute.  I'm the actor who was the one that created the part.  I did all the dialogue with Jonathan Harris. 
[01:57:30]  And, in fact, there's some funny stories about Jonathan and I.  Oh, dear, I bet.  Yes, yes.  Oh, the pain.  Dear boy.  Now, Opie, I want to hear a good...  No, it's Anthony.  I want to hear an imitation of Jonathan.  He was just doing it.  Oh, that wasn't Jonathan.  Shut up, you bubble-headed boogie.  There's Jonathan.  Now, listen.  No, the way it worked very simply is our announcer...  You clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Well, don't forget bubble-headed boogie, please.  I thought I just said that. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that...  Well, never fear.  Smith was there.  Now, wait a minute.  You did the trading, the little banter with Jonathan Harris.  All that on the soundstage and weeks later in post-production,  our announcer would loop over the top of my lines.  Oh, so you're not even famous.  But you're not the guy.  You're nobody.  Hey, don't start with me, baby.  I'm from New York.  I did Broadway.  I'll pick your buns.  To hear the robot.  What happened?  Why can't we speak with the robot?  All right, listen, guys.  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  I'm in Australia with our announcer.  We're doing a public appearance.  And we're on the radio station with this DJ.  And so Dick Tufelt, who was our announcer,  and I drove the poor DJ nuts because I said,  warning, and he went, warning.  And the guy says, who the hell's doing this?  So we did the whole show that way.  Hello, that was a joke. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Hey, guys, why don't you just save time and...  Can we just pass out some NyQuil around the studio?  Where'd you find this guy?  Hey, no, listen.  You guys are big fans of Jonathan.  Oh, of course.  And rightfully so.  He's a great guy.  And what?  Did you ever see him touch young William?  Well, I saw him.  He was grabbing him from behind.  Wow!  We were doing a scene one day where Jonathan had to polish the robot.  Yeah.  Or a thing he lost his bet.  Polish the robot.  So he was polishing the robot, and I said, lower. 
[01:59:30]  And he got lower.  And I said, lower.  He got even lower.  Finally, he dropped his hand lower,  and I turned right around to him, and I said, I love you.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Wait, wait, Bob.  I can't get past the fact that you're not the guy.  Yes, I am.  You were just the guy in the suit.  Don't start with me.  Were you actually in the suit? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Now, are you a man of short stature?  Yes, I am.  And how tall would you be?  I am 5'6".  Okay.  And did you move it around in there?  Well, yeah.  I did everything with it.  In fact, Irwin Allen allowed Jonathan Harris and myself to create our own characterization.  Yes.  What's your claim to fame?  I mean, you didn't even walk.  Oh, yes, I did.  Was it on a wheel thing?  No.  When it was in the full outfit, they pulled it with cables because the thing weighed 350 pounds.  They pulled it with cables.  And then sometimes I would carry the top section, which weighed 250 pounds. 
[02:00:30]  I would carry that on a parachute-type harness.  And just when we thought we were a big deal, we're at the garden in front of 11,000 people.  Yeah.  This shows how pathetic we still are.  We can't even get the guy that does the robot voice from Lost in Space.  Who's his agent?  Forrest Lawn?  How old is he?  Oh, who's the agent?  William Morris.  That's Forrest Lawn.  That's for damn sure.  But the actual William Morris.  That's the guy.  So, hey, what have you done lately? 
[02:01:00]  What have I done lately?  Well, since Lost in Space, I did several Jerry Lewis films, of course.  Wow.  That'll get you a few laughs.  You're definitely Lost in Space.  Oh, I'm lost in you.  Believe it.  What do you ask a guy that was just in a suit and didn't do the voice?  You ever fart in the costume?  No, but I'll tell you this.  Mark Goddard and Bill Moomey locked me in there for lunch.  Two things happened.  Well, yeah.  Number one, my wife knew where I was every moment.  And second of all, I had nothing else to do, so I lit up a cigarette and I was smoking 
[02:01:30]  and Irwin Allen came on the set, saw smoke coming out of it, went for the fire extinguisher,  and it didn't happen, of course.  But from then on, any time smoke had to come out of the robot, they handed me a cigar.  You want really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah.  Let's just not say anything anymore until he hangs up.  Check it out with Mark Goddard.  All right.  Wow.  What else can you tell us?  What else can I tell you?  Well, I, as a robot, you know, I have a great memory because my computer banks will focus 
[02:02:00]  on all different things.  So now I have a memory of you guys, and I expect to see your asses out here at the convention.  If you're not out here, I'll send Dr. Smith to do what he's done to many of us.  Now, since you have such a busy schedule and dialogue is at a rarity, I must go because 
[02:02:30]  I've got to get down to the fans.  But I really appreciate being on your show, and I look forward to you coming out and being  on mine.  All right, guys, and remember, if you want a star, get a hold of Big Ken.  Kev does it all.  All right, thanks.  Hey, guys, it's Big Kev.  I have never felt more like a Met my entire life. 
[02:03:00]  My God.  All right, say something.  Ping pong balls, anything.  Whatever, Ben.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Big bun. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, God.  That is so uncomfortable.  Oh, I am friggin' sweating.  I'm cringing.  That is awful.  That's so uncomfortable.  Now Big Cat's got to be like, no, the show, you know.  Sometimes the zipper would get stuck.  Other times.  One time I put the right leg on backwards, and I had to start over again and put the left leg on.  One time I was lost in Cleveland. 
[02:04:00]  One time I was lost in Trenton, New Jersey.  I've never been lost in space.  Not really.  However, there's actually two costumes.  Fascinating.  One I would make for public appearances.  Dude, we had to do that same interview with the guys that were in the Star Wars suits. 
[02:04:30]  I was like, what do you ask them?  Yeah, when the movie came, the last movie came out, Star Wars one, all the guys who are not in the most recent Star Wars movie were here.  Like Boba Fett.  The guy that was in R2-D2.  The guy that played Darth Vader.  The Wookiee.  And the Darth Vader guy.  Right.  And we didn't know what to ask him, because all they were were the guys in the suits.  And it turned out he was only the Darth Vader one in the, like, third one. 
[02:05:00]  Like, it wasn't even the first Darth Vader guy.  It was like the third one.  Interesting enough.  Interesting enough.  The suits today are flame retarded.  One time I was smoking a cigar.  In between takes.  In between takes.  It was episode number 72.  Where we get lost in space. 
[02:05:30]  And an ash fell on my leg.  Now, these suits today, they're flame retarded.  But I lost a toe that day.  Irwin Allen came over to me and said, where's your toe?  The great Irwin Allen.  The great Irwin Allen.  Not to be confused with Marty Allen, Steve Allen, Herb Allen, Paul Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Burns and Allen. 
[02:06:00]  Allen.  Or Allen.  Then he has to go, well, I gotta go.  I gotta go.  Wait, someone's pissed at us.  Come on, that was funny.  Kathy, what's up?  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  This guy has the littlest claim to fame.  And you totally killed him.  We thought we were getting the voice, you know.  And through the voice.  We thought we had the guy.  Oh, my God.  Warning, warning, Will Robinson. 
[02:06:30]  Get back to the Jupiter 2.  That poor little old guy.  Now, he's all upset.  And you guys are laughing.  And then you try to make it up by saying, go see his show.  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Anyway, it was pretty funny, though, listening to Dead Space.  But at the same time, you guys are mean.  Love you.  See you.  All right, bye.  He was lost in space.  He was.  A lot of people saying that.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Get Big Kevin back on the phone, by the way. 
[02:07:00]  Dan.  Yeah, I want to see what the aftermath of that debacle was.  Hello, Dan?  You gone?  All right.  Well, Bob May, the guy that was in the robot suit.  Big Kevin's going to have to kill a few more children and bury him in his basement to make up for the aggravation of that call.  Yeah.  I'll call you Opie and you Anthony.  And now I'm going to kill you.  All right.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, the actual robot would be funnier than that guy.  Well, possibly, yeah. 
[02:07:30]  I resent that.  Anyway.  It's easy putting on that costume every day for 60 straight years.  How many times can you tell people how much it weighed and how many pieces it was in?  When I see these actors like Jim Carrey in his Grinch costume, it's reminding me of the day that Erwin Allen and I were lost on the Jersey Turnpike going to this Focarta convention. 
[02:08:00]  I go, and one more guy calls me Mr. Spock.  And I go, I go, but you don't, you didn't even walk in the costume.  Well, we had a bully system.  Cables would drag him around and he's just standing inside this thing.  So it's not even like body mannerisms there.  What about the arms?  They used to wave around when he would go, warning, warning, warning.  And then he would talk like, warning, warning. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, Smith, wax me.  And then they'd have the guy overlay, hey, Dr. Smith, please shine my armor.  But he'd be, ah.  Classic.  I had 15 minutes of fame.  I can't stop.  Unfortunately, my face was covered.  You know, why would you put yourself in that position?  People are going to show up and go, wow, do the voice. 
[02:09:00]  Well, I don't do the voice.  I don't do the voice.  I was just in the suit.  You know every single person.  Every single person that goes there that wants to see the robot is going to ask them to do the voice.  And then, oh, I didn't do the voice.  But the costume weighs 500 pounds, and it was pulled by a cable system.  One time I was smoking.  They didn't even trust me to walk.  They had to pull me with a cable.  They pulled me with pulleys.  These kids today, Alf and Chewbacca, they don't know what it was like. 
[02:09:30]  Actors strike my ass.  Byron Allen, Debbie Allen, Allen from Scooby-Doo and I.  Wow.  Damn, that was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony, what do you have over there?  Well, Opie.  You were talking about Nixon or something or George W? 
[02:10:00]  Constant search for news.  That's what I am, Mr. Newshound.  You know, Bush, President-elect Bush, he's trying to get his peeps in place.  You know, much like the management here at any double.  And he's picked for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.  All right.  Now, you might not know who this guy is, but he used to work with Richard Nixon many, many years ago.  And they found some tapes of him talking with Dick Nixon. 
[02:10:30]  And some of the conversation, wow, a little abrasive where the blacks are concerned.  Back then, very turbulent time, Opie.  And who was it?  Agnew.  Spiro Agnew.  Nixon's vice president.  Went to Africa.  And while he was in Africa, he started saying stuff like,  The blacks in Africa are much smarter and much nicer than the blacks that we have over in America. 
[02:11:00]  That would be pretty much a career-ending statement.  Sure.  But he went on for a little longer until the tax evasion stuff got him.  But Nixon then commented on some of Agnew's comments.  And as he did, this guy Donald Rumsfeld was in the room with Nixon.  And, of course, Nixon had all of his tapes going.  Nixon loved to tape record everything.  So, as he's talking.  So, there's tapes of Nixon saying the stuff you're about to say? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He was talking.  And this Rumsfeld guy just kept saying stuff like,  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Like, he didn't want to elaborate on anything.  But he was saying,  Yeah.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  After all these Nixon comments.  Now, a couple of things he said.  Newspaper cited that it said,  Agnew's unflattering comparisons between African and American blacks.  Saying that African blacks were smarter, too, he said. 
[02:12:00]  Nixon said,  That doesn't help.  It hurts us with the blacks.  He was always trying to get a relationship with black people and young people, Nixon.  So, he said,  It doesn't help with the blacks.  It doesn't help with the rednecks either.  Because the rednecks don't think any Negroes are good.  So, he's going.  And that's when Rumsfeld said,  Yes.  He just said,  Yes.  So, is he in trouble for, like...  They're trying to get something out of it. 
[02:12:30]  They're trying to, you know, get something out of this.  But to be quite frank with you,  I think Nixon's right there.  I don't think the rednecks like any black people.  As for the notion that black Americans aren't as good as black Africans,  Nixon said,  Most of them are basically just out of the trees.  Nixon said that?  Oh, my God.  Nixon said that?  That's right.  Most of them are just out of the trees. 
[02:13:00]  Get the F out.  Oh.  And then he said something like,  Well, by God,  even the Southerners say,  Well, our niggers is...  And then it says unintelligible.  I'd love to know what Tricky Dick said there.  About our niggers.  Goddamn Nixon.  And then he said,  Hell, that's the way they talk. 
[02:13:30]  After the unintelligible part.  And Rumsfeld said...  So maybe he was doing some of that gibberish.  Maybe.  And Rumsfeld to that said,  That's right.  And then Nixon said something like,  I can hear them.  I don't even know what he was talking about.  Then Rumsfeld said,  I know.  And then Nixon says, continues,  It's like when our black athletes at the Olympics  are running against other black athletes.  The Southerners may not like the black,  but he's for that black athlete. 
[02:14:00]  And then Rumsfeld says,  That's right.  Right, Nixon says.  That's for sure, Rumsfeld said.  Well, enough of that.  That's what he said.  So this Rumsfeld guy now is getting in a little bit of trouble  for just saying,  That's right.  I know.  That's for sure.  Chris has some more info on this.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Well, he was right what he said, man.  You know, like, hell,  I mean, one minute they're swinging from trees,  next minute they're driving behind the Lexus and all that. 
[02:14:30]  Not you, Opie, but, you know,  half of the older ones selling their drugs and all that.  Well, Jesus Christ.  People now agreeing with Dick Nixon.  They're just out of the trees.  Ben Stein, come here and write me a speech about the color.  Y'all going to make me lose my mind.  Up in here.  Up in here.  They're just out of the trees.  Y'all going to make me act a fool, Spiro. 
[02:15:00]  Y'all going to make me lose my cool.  Up in here.  Where's Tricia?  Look at this.  Rumsfeld, get over here.  Check out my bling bling.  I bought Ben, my new sports writer,  some bling bling and some ice.  Oh, boy. 
[02:15:30]  Where's my bling bling?  Checkers.  Checkers.  I'm cashing in checkers for a new dog.  I want a Roddy.  All us homies use Roddy.  Look at me.  I live in D.C.  Pretty ethnic.  I'm going to have my Secret Service bust a cap in your ass.  They're just out of trees, Earl. 
[02:16:00]  I'm from Oak Town, G.  I popped two cops because they didn't give me my props.  Where's Ben, my Jew speech writer?  Try to spin this in a positive light.  I think they're just out of the trees, the colored.  Come on, Ben.  Spin it and get some ice from your old pal, Tricky D.  Tricky D's taking y'all to Mickey D. 
[02:16:30]  The color just out of the trees, Ben.  Where's Kissinger, my head Jew?  Bring my ride.  Look at my hoopsie is tight.  Ben, take a ride in my hoopsie.  Y'all going to make me act a fool.  Up in here.  Up in here.  Y'all going to make me lose my coop. 
[02:17:00]  Up in here.  Up in here.  I bring down...  Give my wife a 40.  She can split it with that drunk Betty Ford.  You keep up.  That you're trying to end up bad.  I'm big dicky in.  Let me pour some out for my homie.  Tricky dick.  He always pops up, man.  I would love...  I could spend an entire day listening to his tapes.  I know I could.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Listen to him talking to Haldeman and Dean and talking out his ace. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Would that be fun?  Liddy.  Liddy.  Give me some info on the colored.  I know those black painters are out there.  Liddy.  I want you to break in.  You're part of my plumbers.  All right.  That's insane.  Plug the leaks.  Get rid of these tapes.  I talk about the colored.  And the G. 
[02:18:00]  He was out of his mind.  Liddy's giving me mad props.  Mad props.  He was bald before it was stylish.  The Negro stole it from Liddy.  You got to love it.  Shahid, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up, Shahid?  Yeah, man.  I don't even know how to begin this, man.  You know, you white people are kind of funny, man. 
[02:18:30]  What's up?  Let me tell you how you guys are funny, man.  Yeah, go.  Just out of the trees, man.  Do you remember a time in history, in your history, in European history, when you guys  couldn't even bathe, man?  You guys remember them days, man?  We're not.  Do you remember those days when you guys were in the caves of Europe, man?  Dude, we're talking about Nixon.  Nixon said that.  Well, oh, yeah.  I thought Tricky Dick was in the studio.  That's who I'm talking to.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what was that?  You know what they...  Remember you guys were in the caves of Europe?  Yeah, and we were still miles ahead of you. 
[02:19:00]  Come on.  Yaddle-doodle.  There, it's fixed.  What?  No, look.  I'll be honest with you.  I've heard a lot of revisionist history on both sides.  What the hell was Farrakhan spouting about that big wheel up in the space?  Did you hear that one?  What wheel in space?  Farrakhan said that there was this big space station wheel that was in space many, many  years before even written history that was full of black people, and black people were 
[02:19:30]  so ahead of the game that there was a big wheel up in space, and, you know, while we  were in caves...  Can we go black to the future and confirm this?  Let me tell you about it.  Let me just tell you about something here.  I'm Earl from the future.  I'm black to the future.  And let me tell you something.  There was indeed a big wheel in the sky, and it turned out to be Reverend Al's big Volkswagen 
[02:20:00]  hubcap medallion.  Just a reflection.  But there was.  There were black space people.  My favorite Moody Martian is what the show is called.  It was a big wheel of a gum and cheese is what it was.  Black to the future.  It's not a DeLorean.  It's an old Cutlass Supreme.  Cheers.  Ha ha.  It's a little white.  That's right.  I'm black to the future.  Black Earth for the future.  Every so often, I've got to come back and let you people know what's going on at WNEW 
[02:20:30]  of the future.  I'm black Earth for the future.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Some Nixon conversation.  There you go.  Tricky Dick.  And it again.  Two, one, two.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat. 
[02:21:00]  It's the O&A Show.  Anthony, this just in, though.  Yeah?  Ken Stevens has returned from lunch.  Ah.  There you go.  Finally back.  I wonder where he's been.  We're going to try to find out.  He's out for a while. 
[02:21:30]  Want to tell everyone what we've been telling everyone?  Well, it just seemed a little odd that the new employee here, Melissa.  The Playboy chick.  Well, yes, she's a very attractive girl.  She's been hired here to assist in promotions.  We think.  We don't even know.  Yeah, that's what they told her.  We've asked everyone today what Melissa does, the new employee.  She started this week, and no one has a clue.  We know she's good at looking hot.  Right?  That's what she does. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  That's what we're trying to, you know, that's what we've decided.  She comes to work like she's coming to, I don't know, flash dancers or privilege.  Right.  Or, like, I'm lying?  No, that's what I'm laughing.  Have you ever worked anywhere where a girl walks around with, like, a cowboy hat on?  Well, not a girl walking around with a cowboy hat, but...  Oh, shut up, Bernard, you jerk.  I wear a cowboy hat, but it's not, doesn't, what's the deal? 
[02:22:30]  Look hot.  No.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  It makes you look stupid.  Yeah.  Stupid, baby.  Melissa hot with cowboy hat.  You stupid with cowboy hat.  Does she wear a, um, a fag bandana around her neck?  Yeah, yeah, like me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Whack, whack.  522.  Well, Ken hired Melissa.  Yeah.  And we're convinced he hired her to just be hot. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  And then we're starting to notice things.  Like, Ken's around a little more.  Ken's around the station a lot more.  Yeah.  He was hired to pretty much babysit you and I in this radio station.  Mm-hmm.  He was here only, like, two days a week until this week.  Yeah.  He's been here every day.  He usually flies out by now.  We asked him, are you flying out?  He said, no, I have lots to do around here.  I'm not leaving until Friday afternoon.  Yeah.  How about that?  Which is very strange. 
[02:23:30]  A whole week.  Anthony saw Ken coming back to the office at 815 last night.  A little late last night coming in.  Seemed like he'd been out, you know, having fun.  Seemed to me having a little fun.  And then today, he was AWOL for a lot of the day.  We got here nice and early.  We got a lot of things to discuss with Ken.  I thought we had traveled back in time to when we first came to WNEW and our old boss 
[02:24:00]  was here who used to take those extended lunches.  Right.  We got here, what, about 1130 today?  Mm-hmm.  Ken was gone until five minutes ago.  520.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is now back from his six-hour lunch.  Mm-hmm.  Did anyone check for body glitter?  Yeah, we have to check them for body glitter.  We got to get her some body glitter.  So that way, we'll know if anything's going on.  If anyone has partook?  Yeah.  Rick?  I gave Ken a note, but he was on a very business-like phone call. 
[02:24:30]  I left him the note.  He looked at it.  He nodded at me.  He said he's going to call into the studio.  Okay.  Business-like phone call.  He's a business-like phone call, yeah.  All right, cover our stories.  He's on the phone right now.  Okay, Ken.  Don't worry.  I'll cover the stories.  No, he's on the phone.  No matter what anyone says, don't fess up to it.  All right, get our stories straight. 
[02:25:00]  What's with this body glitter on me?  You can't wear that stuff.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ken.  I won't next time.  I love you, sweetie.  I love you, too.  Keep this forbidden love under wraps.  But, Ken, I never realized how you could get your F on.  Yeah, a lot of people, they don't know the real Ken Stevens. 
[02:25:30]  But when I'm with a hottie like you, I know how to get my F on.  Three nuts.  Boom.  That horny goat we were.  Ken, I love when you lick my feet.  Yeah, I have like a foot fetish.  Don't let that get out.  Yeah.  Ken, you're so hot.  I can't believe you're an animal in bed. 
[02:26:00]  That's kind of a secret I need to cover up, too.  Don't talk sex.  What are you wearing right now?  Let me just pull my junk out here.  I'll take care of myself right in my own office.  Christ, why does my office have this big glass door?  Everyone can watch.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Ken, you're a dirty bitch, aren't you?  I'm going to slap you on the head with this huge Arbitron book. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, there's a couch in my office that's been used for some things.  Oh, yeah, Ken?  Yeah.  You want to recreate a scene from the O&A show?  I'm going to make believe I fire myself for having anal on the couch. 
[02:27:00]  You up for that?  Ken, touch my dirty place.  You got it.  So, he's going to call the show after he takes this important phone call?  Yeah.  Okay.  Look what I did to you again.  Oh, Ken, imagine what your employees would think if you were... 
[02:27:30]  They knew you were prancing around my apartment in my panties and bra.  Yeah, maybe we can keep that under wrap.  You're a filthy whore.  Go F yourself.  Who knows? 
[02:28:00]  We've got to get to the bottom of this.  All right, so, is he going to come on live?  I think we want him on the phone for this one.  Yeah, I gave him the numbers of the hotline.  Yeah, behind two closed locked doors would be nice.  Ken, I got a strap on.  Yeah, you know I like that, bitch.  Could you dress up like a schoolgirl next time? 
[02:28:30]  I like your cowboy outfit, but...  From behind, I feel like I'm having sex with Don Imus.  Yeah, baby, a three-way phone call.  How you doing, Don Imus?  Ken, the other night at my apartment, that was great.  I like the way you grabbed my oxygen mask like rains and rode me like destiny.  Okay, baby.  My God. 
[02:29:00]  Well, we'll have to get to the bottom of it and see what really happened.  Brian, what's going on?  Guys, you see that little glowing light in the corner of your eye?  Yeah.  That is your early retirement light.  It just went into high gear.  What happened?  What?  It's over, Johnny.  It's all over.  Why is everyone leaving the studio?  What happened?  I thought we were all having fun.  Holy Christ.  What?  Hey, Rich.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, man?  Oh, man. 
[02:29:30]  Y'all trying to get fired again?  No.  Y'all learn from Boston?  Come on, man.  A strap on, man?  Come on.  Let's take it easy.  I don't know.  Ken wasn't too appreciated when Psycho Mark did his dirty little deed in his office.  Well, Psycho Mark had a couple duanal in Ken Stevens' office, yes.  Well, yeah, well.  He didn't appreciate that too much.  I don't think he's going to enjoy you guys simulating his alleged affair with his new pieces of A walking around the office.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  What? 
[02:30:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Anthony.  Yo.  What up?  Yo, man.  I'm on the expressway.  I'm going to crash my car.  What's the matter?  Come on.  My God.  It's getting a little uncomfortable around here, though.  Oh, I'm telling you.  Wait.  Rick's running back into the office.  Rick?  He's about to call in.  Oh, God.  He's about ready to call in.  I don't think he still knows what it's about.  I have to get off the phone now.  I have to call the guys.  You just keep this under wraps, okay?  You got it. 
[02:30:30]  As long as you wear that little ballerina costume like you did last night.  You know I love that.  How can I get this body glitter off of my genitals?  Do you have something I could use for that?  You know, I never thought I'd ever, ever have sex like I did last night.  But that ecstasy you got me, we were on X last night.  It was great.  Spank me.  I've been a bad GM.  I'm such a bad GM.  Spank me.  Mm, Ken.  I'll spank you. 
[02:31:00]  Come into my little office.  I'll get the paddle out and spank you.  I like that because I've been so dirty and so bad.  Would you have any reservations about dressing up like a nurse and giving me enemas?  Not at all, Ken.  I'll lay down some plastic in my office here, put some paper up on the big window, and you  could just clean me out.  Can I call you mommy? 
[02:31:30]  Melissa?  Can I call you mommy?  Anything, Ken.  I don't know why he's not calling now.  I don't know.  You know he turned on the radio.  He's now listening to us.  Why is he calling?  I don't know.  He should call.  Get in on the fun.  This is fun, right?  Lewis?  Yeah, fun.  Loads of fun.  Yeah, we're having a ball now, aren't we?  Hey, you know why the studio's empty?  Much like when you're looking up and you see that big exocet missile coming in and everybody 
[02:32:00]  bails, everyone's bailing on you two guys.  Oh, come on.  Because they're getting ready for the...  Where there's no more Opie and no more Anthony, just little pieces of them all over the world.  Thanks.  Good God almighty.  Anthony, by the way, get rid of the gym thing and get one of those puffed up body suits for  under your clothing.  Save a lot of money, man.  Thanks, Lewis.  I'll look into that.  Melissa, we're going to play Find Your Paycheck.  It's somewhere on my body. 
[02:32:30]  You call me Uncle Ken, okay?  Now, it's somewhere on there.  No, that's not it.  It's not there.  You see, you're checking the front.  It's not in the front.  All right.  Now, I'm going to start treating you like I'd like to treat Opie and Anthony, but can't.  So, bend over.  Turn around. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, Ken, that hurts.  You know how to deliver three inches.  Eric, what's up?  Three words, dude.  Punch out, Maverick.  What's the matter?  Punch out now, dude.  I don't play it.  Why you still got a show?  All right.  Later.  I don't play it.  Yeah, you don't believe, do you?  I don't play it. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Say, give it to me, GM.  Give it to me.  Oh.  I have the video camera set up.  Look at my pop shot.  Uh-oh.  Is that the hotline?  Yes, it's on the hotline.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  Ken.  Ouch.  Hello.  Ken, how you doing?  Gentlemen, how are you?  Very good.  What's going on?  Pardon?  What's going on?  Not much.  Yeah.  We were just in the middle of a bit.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Well, we were doing a news...  Your producer gave me a phone number and said to dial it, and I did.  Yeah, we're just going over what's going on in New York.  Yeah.  Trying to upgrade the program.  Oh, yeah?  How are you feeling about the station these days and the shows and everything? 
[02:34:30]  Pretty good, as a matter of fact.  Yeah, I bet.  Yourselves?  Good.  Good.  Good.  Yeah.  Having a great time.  Yeah, thanks again.  Loving it.  Lately.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And we like your new hire, by the way.  Which one?  Melissa.  Oh, thank you.  Everyone's enjoying her and her pictures, and I think she's a fine addition to the station.  Good.  How do you feel about Melissa?  Me?  Yeah.  I think she's a fine addition to the station.  Right.  Yep.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Does she do anything, Ken? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, what does she do?  She, uh...  Is her job to just look hot?  No, I think she would tell you that there's more to it than that.  Yeah.  Would you say she's a fine addition to your staff?  Well, that's not polite.  Well, she's on your staff, right?  Uh, she's on the station.  On the station staff?  On the station payroll.  Right.  Okay, so she's on the staff. 
[02:35:30]  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, that's great.  Have you heard the show today yet, Ken?  No, I've been out.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  Obviously, I've missed something.  Where have you been?  Because we noticed you...  Ken, we got here today at 1130.  We figured we got some business to talk over, right?  Some things to discuss.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, no Ken.  Yeah.  Now, although it does seem that of recent...  You have been spending more time here at NEW and in New York instead of your duties elsewhere in the country. 
[02:36:00]  Uh, we've noticed you've been absent for, for lunch and maybe taking a little more time away from the station, um, than, than you have when you're usually here in New York.  Well...  Ever since...  Let's see.  I guess what Ann's trying to say is, uh...  Beginning of the week?  You took a six-hour lunch today.  We've been...  Yeah.  Keeping track.  So, you're assuming that that entire time was lunch.  That hurts.  No, not lunch or anything.  No, no, no.  We're not assuming anything.  We'd be silly to assume things. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  But, um...  That would be bad DJs to assume anything.  It can't...  Because it isn't just like, you know, you aren't here.  There are other people, I guess, that are employed by, uh, NEW that also aren't here.  So, we're not just picking on you.  There's other people.  Let me just think off the top of my head.  Who else?  Was Melissa around today?  Uh, no.  No, I didn't see her, uh, for lunch either.  Yeah, she took a few hours today, too.  Yeah.  Do you know where she might have been, um...  For her extended lunch, Ken?  I think I see where you're going with this. 
[02:37:00]  What?  What are you assuming?  Yeah?  I'm shocked.  I'm shocked that you would suggest such a thing.  Mm-hmm.  Well, you are a man.  Well, that would be impressive, actually.  Well, I'm a happily married man with a, uh, six-year-old son.  Hey!  Hey, you don't gotta make excuses to me, Ken.  You know.  You justify it any way you want.  Boy, you try to do something nice for you guys, and this is the reward. 
[02:37:30]  Can we, uh...  Can we take a look at your face for body glitter?  Yeah.  You don't have any body glitter on you, do you?  Body glitter?  Yeah.  You ever see body glitter?  There's a lot of, uh, strippers wear it, and, uh, girls that want to go out on the town  and have a good time?  Right.  You've seen the stuff, right?  Oh, so that would be, like, the telltale sign if there's body glitter on my suit.  Ken, let me just give you a little word of advice.  Yeah.  This stuff's impossible to come off.  So you best just never get it on you.  In any situation.  I'm not saying anything's happening anywhere, but in any situation. 
[02:38:00]  Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, right?  Okay.  Gotcha.  Ken?  Thanks for the advice.  No problem.  Burn that.  Here to help.  Burn that suit.  Ken, can Stinky come in and smell your fingers?  Would that be out of line in any way?  I think I'd have to draw the line somewhere.  Yeah, I wouldn't have him, uh, smell him either.  That's certainly a good place to start.  Good choice, Ken.  Never let anybody.  Can I go now?  Hey, if you got things to do, that's fine.  I understand. 
[02:38:30]  Nothing more important than talking to you, but...  Alibis to concoct, whatever.  Okay.  All right, Ken.  Thanks for calling.  Well, have fun, and I'm glad we really got to the bottom of this and cleared up a lot.  This is a great job, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yep.  Thanks.  All right, Ken.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  It's our boss, Ken Stevens.  They're on to me.  They're totally on to me.  What are we going to do about this? 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Well, I'm sold.  Sounded like he was enjoying that.  I see no problem.  It looks to me like any suspicions we've had have been thrown out the window.  You know, he cleared everything up perfectly.  He was where for lunch?  Oh, we never said.  Melissa was where for lunch?  Oh, never said.  Hey, Phil, what's up?  Oh, you guys are so fired.  Are they going to at least put best of on for a little while before they replace you or 
[02:39:30]  something along that line?  Yeah, he didn't seem to be chuckling with that one.  No, not at all.  It wasn't one of the funny little times we've been on our airwaves.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  You ruined it.  All right, Phil.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye.  Well, it's all clear now.  Hey, why are they pulling us out of the studio?  Um, I've got to go out and buy some Febreze.  I'm going to be right back.  Okay?  Febreze. 
[02:40:00]  That's why you've got to listen for a long time.  Wow.  I almost lost a log.  Well, we have breaking news. 
[02:40:30]  Breaking news, man.  Breaking news.  Elion Gonzalez and family are arriving at Dulles Airport.  They are taking a plane out of the United States of America within the next, like, half  hour.  Good.  This poor kid.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Goodbye.  It's over.  Goodbye.  We're watching the coverage on MSNBC right now. 
[02:41:00]  There's a police car.  We're waiting to see the little kid.  There's the father.  Where's Elion?  There's Elion.  Where's little Elion?  There's Elion's half-brother.  No, that's a little kid.  No, Elion.  There goes Elion.  Is he getting on the plane right now?  He just got on the plane with his stepmom, his father, and his stepson.  They are boarding the plane to get the hell out of Dodge. 
[02:41:30]  All right, boy.  That kid's in for a surprise.  When he gets there, where are all the toys?  Where's my good clothes that I had?  Where's the nice house?  Why am I living in a shack?  Right.  This sucks.  Oh, that's just...  I want to go back to America.  This Christmas ain't going to be like last Christmas for little Elion.  Remember that clip of him with all the toys and everything?  Yeah.  And he's playing out in the yard.  Oh, he's going to get back to Cuba, and Fidel's probably going to arrest his whole family  for even being here.  He gets rescued, what, Thanksgiving weekend? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And he goes back to Cuba right around the 4th of July.  Yeah.  That just blows, man.  Oh, poor kid.  God damn.  There's just a ton of people boarding that plane right now.  And the final little thing for Elion, his hot cousin just wowed him as he gets on his  airplane.  She's got an offer to pose in the penthouse, Anthony.  She will.  She definitely will.  She'll do it.  If we got Darver to pose, I think we can get that little pose bag to pose. 
[02:42:30]  Father to speak shortly, Anthony.  Ah, good.  We really need to hear that.  Well, in honor of Elion Gonzalez going back to Cuba with his father and his half-brother  and step-mom.  Yeah.  Here's a little ditty, and we'll be back.  Hey.  Drown, drown, Cuban, drown, drown, Cuban, drown.  Yeah.  Cuban, drown, drown, drown, drown, Cuban, drown.  Turn around.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Cuban, drown, drown, drown, knock it down. 
[02:43:00]  Cuban on your way.  Cuban, drown, drown, drown, knock it down.  USA.  Cuban, drown, drown, knock it down.  Let's hear it for the refugees.  Give them a hand.  Roll for days just to open up a taco stand.  Twenty cubits float on a one-bottle cork.  Guantanamo Bay is just a five-minute walk.  Turn around.  Keep me down, drown, drown, drop it down.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Keep me down, drown, drown, drop it down. 
[02:43:30]  Human refugees.  Keep me down, drown, drown, drop it down.  Keep me down, drown, drop it down.  We took all your relatives.  Stay away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Babaluuya.  Look at Mama Zeta.  She's as big as a boat.  You'd shove a motor up her ass if you thought she'd float.  Turn around.  Keep me down, drown, drown, drown, knock it down.  Oh, we hope you won't drown.  Keep me down, drown, drown, drown, knock it down.  Keep me down your way. 
[02:44:00]  Keep me down, drown, drown, drown, knock it down.  USA.  Keep me down, drown, drown, knock it down.  Cuban, drown.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Drown, drown, drown, drown, knock it down, yeah.  Cuban, drown, drown, drown, knock it down.  Cuban, drown, drown, knock it down.  Godspeed, little Elyon, Godspeed. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, Jake, what do you got for the show today?  So what do you think?  You know, you got to take a look at Elyon now,  because I don't think you're ever going to see another live shot of him.  I don't know.  I bet you he tries to get back here in like 10 years.  Yeah, once he gets a little older, he's going to jump on a little tiger tube.  Once he gets a better pitching arm, maybe.  Tiger tube and try to get back.  When he gets a little older, he's going to realize how close he was to having the good life, 
[02:45:00]  and he's going to make another run for it.  Yeah, the only thing that's going to save him now is a good pitching arm, maybe.  Yeah, he's done for the next 10 years, but you watch.  He'll come back here.  Oh, absolutely.  And plus, when he gets off there and he's hanging out with all the other kids,  I think they're just going to beat the crap out of him.  They're like, oh, it was so much better over there.  Where's your toys now?  They're just going to start beating the sin out of them.  He's going to have a weird life.  Yeah, he's going to be affected.  We'll be reading about him soon enough.  We'll have a whatever happened to, like, baby Jessica that fell in the well.  Remember her?  And, like, years later, they'll do a whole thing on it.  Maybe they can set him up on a blind date or something. 
[02:45:30]  It'll be like this big, fat, bearded guy smoking a cigar.  I was little Lillian.  All right, guys.  Have a good afternoon.  All right, Jake.  And this just in.  I love the Internet.  There's already pictures up on the Internet all over the place.  People just crying and hugging each other outside the relative's house.  Or the old house, because I think they finally moved from that place.  One sign says, keep Lillian free in the background.  Yeah, sure.  But the Supreme Court has been heard. 
[02:46:00]  And actually, they refused to hear the case.  It's over.  Oh, they didn't get into the plane.  They got into one of those.  What the hell is that called, Anthony?  It's like a people mover type thing.  Oh, yeah.  So he's not actually in the plane.  That thing pulls up to the plane, I think.  Yeah, it'll pull up to the plane, and then they'll get on.  Like a Pez dispenser.  Yeah.  It's one of the portable ones, though.  They could take out into the middle of the runway.  I'm looking at CNN.com, and I'm looking at overhead pictures of the vehicle that little 
[02:46:30]  Lillian got in.  What does this look like?  I know, it's the whole OJ thing all over you.  It looks like, I'm looking down through some.  No, Psycho Mark, they didn't just put Lillian and his family in a gas chamber.  You sick bastard.  The overhead shot looks like OJ in the white Bronco.  Did they follow him from the house to the airport?  Oh, yeah.  Is that really necessary?  To watch the truck drive Lillian down the road? 
[02:47:00]  I mean, even him at the airport's ridiculous, but driving him down the road, is that newsworthy?  Holy smoke.  Maybe you've got a wow sticker on the back, and people are flashing cans at little Lillian.  Oh, wow.  Too effing much.  Hey, are you guys taking the challenge?  Breaking news.  No, we're not taking the challenge.  Breaking news.  Let's take the challenge.  We're watching the vehicle containing Lillian Gonzalez and family drive to the airport, 
[02:47:30]  where he will then be, him and his family will be boarding an airplane, which will take  him to Cuba.  We will be closely following this story, as per Frank, the radio critic.  And, oh, look, look.  Big hairy man-ass, a moon being shown on the airplane.  Just reporting the news as we see it.  Oh, they've got a drug-sniffing dog sniffing the luggage, Anthony.  Sniff their colon.  That's where they hide the drugs.  Anthony, I must break in here.  This is a very tragic day for Lillian Gonzalez. 
[02:48:00]  Why is that, Opie?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Oh, you're doing the news?  Yeah.  This just in.  Oh, my God.  He got on the wrong plane.  He got on a plane bound for the NAMBLA convention in Denver.  Oh, this will be time and time again.  Oh, no.  I think we have a microphone in the airplane that Little Elyon is on.  Do you like having your background?  Oh, no.  Oh, it's over. 
[02:48:30]  Clown hat, curly hair, smiley face.  Screw you guys, I'm going home.  And we got a quote from Little Elyon, who says, screw you guys, I'm going home.  He has no idea what he's going home to.  What else, Elyon?  What?  What?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Oh, no.  It's over.  Breaking news.  You'll hear it here first. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Little Elyon on a NAMBLA plane bound for Denver.  This is Justin Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We're covering the ongoing saga of Little Elyon.  Elyon.  Elyon.  Elyon.  Why couldn't he just be named Jose?  Little Elyon Gonzalez. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Aborting an aircraft bound for Cuba, where he will be rejoined with his Cuban family,  much to the chagrin of the residents of Miami who have taken Little Elyon as their own.  Tom?  Yeah.  You sound really, really out of it today.  Everything okay?  Well, I was puffing on some Cubans down in Miami.  I think someone hollowed one out and made a split. 
[02:50:00]  So I'm a little stoned.  A little stoned, huh?  Yes.  So join me as I cover Little Elyon at the NAMBLA convention, me and Katie Couric's colon.  No, no, no, no, no.  And saying that we invented the wheel.  Tom, I think you smoked some chronic.  Yeah, I was some chronic.  You must have smoked some chronic because...  It was dope.  No, it's very obvious what's going on.  Elyon and his family are going to be boarding a plane and going back to Cuba. 
[02:50:30]  Hello.  Yes, Tom Brogan, NBC.  Nightly News.  It was hydro, Opie.  I was on the hydro.  Look at my official NBC News truck with a WOW bandana wrapped around it.  As it was in the beginning, the origin of WOW.  Join me and Katie Couric's colon as we probe the beginnings of WOW.  Look, I'm pulling a WOW bandana out of Katie Couric's colon like a magician would pull it out of his sleeve. 
[02:51:00]  Watch.  They don't end.  They're all tied together.  Oh, look, a brassiere.  It's knotted and she's moaning in pleasure.  Tom.  Yes, Tom Brogan, NBC Nightly News.  Could we stay with the breaking news here?  Breaking news, Tom Brogan stoned to the bejesus belt off of chronic hydro and a split. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, Tom, Tom.  Yes.  It's Elyon.  Elyon Gonzalez now boarding an aircraft.  This is a story that a lot of people have been following for a very long time.  Oh, who gives a flying F?  Come on.  You know where I got this?  A pot?  I got it from a Negro.  This just in, I got it from a Negro.  Elyon.  Have you ever seen a drunk man naked?  Katie Couric.  I will be flying on the aircraft with Elyon, his family, and Katie Couric's colon. 
[02:52:00]  We're going to try to smuggle back as much Cuban as we can in that dry snub she calls a buck.  And if I may add, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, I'm over here now.  Pusa!  Pusa.  Ilyon's plane, has it taken off yet?  No, they have the dog sniffing the luggage.  Oh, I thought that was one of his many relatives boarding the aircraft, but no, it does appear to be a laborator retriever. 
[02:52:30]  What the hell could they possibly be smuggling back to Cuba?  Look, they're going through suitcases.  Right.  They're looking for the cousin's panties.  The police looking for the cousin's panties, putting it on their heads as they speak breaking news.  What the hell would they be smuggling back to Cuba?  From, oh, Douglas Airport.  Why can't they be at JFK?  Douglas Airport, little Elyon.  I'll be covering the Elyon story until 2. 
[02:53:00]  2.  Ponderous.  Is that John on the phone?  Where are those naked little boy pictures I was supposed to see?  Tom.  Yeah.  Could you stay with the breaking news?  I'm trying to stay with the story, but I was smoking some of the hydro.  You're a newsman.  What are the dogs sniffing for?  They're going through the luggage.  The dogs are sniffing the luggage.  They're looking for something, Tom.  What is it?  They're probably smuggling food.  The little child isn't going to have much of that back in Cuba.  Either that or Katie Couric sat on them and the dog is smelling open colon. 
[02:53:30]  Open Katie Couric colon.  NBC breaking news.  We're here at Dulles Airport as little Elyon is boarding the Achilles Loro for hello.  Hey, Tom Brokaw, CBS.  Here's Sly and the Family Stone.  Get me a blunt.
