<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a jam-packed lineup of guests and events.  Anthony Cumia was visibly excited about his upcoming appearance on Red Eye, though a minor hiccup with his hotel room led to a hasty departure from the studio.  The show then hosted a group of teenage magicians, alongside the renowned Lance Burton.  Their appearance unfortunately coincided with Club Soda Kenny’s repeated telling of crude, sexually explicit jokes.

Comedian Jim Jefferies was also a guest, contributing his characteristically unfiltered humor. His appearance, alongside the magicians and the already raunchy atmosphere, significantly amplified the show's comedic – and sexually charged – tone.  His previous intoxicated appearance on the show was briefly referenced.  Jefferies' interaction with porn star Justine Jolie, who was promoting a play, was particularly noteworthy.  Their encounter devolved into a highly uncomfortable, sexually explicit exchange featuring a poorly executed dance routine and numerous crude jokes.

The broadcast also included a contentious segment involving E-Rock, who was contacted while on his honeymoon.  The resulting on-air ribbing angered E-Rock considerably, prompting angry messages to several staff members.  Opie eventually calmed the situation with a phone call, but the incident dominated much of the after-show discussion, along with speculation about its potential impact on a project or event referred to as "202."

Finally, radio personality Ron Bennington appeared as a guest, engaging in conversation about his own controversies with an individual known as "AK Laszlo."  The discussion also included Bobby Slayton, Fez, and accusations of "puppet-mastering."  The entire broadcast, as evidenced by the after-show discussion, was characterized by a high volume of sexually explicit jokes, crude language, and discussions of highly inappropriate behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a show!  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Very glad we're back to the old music instead of that Star Wars, whatever that was.  I can't remember. What planet is that band on?  Who cares?  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:00:30]  I'm Sam Roberts.  Anthony just got out of here.  Opie was quick to leave the studio today.  He was ready to go.  The allergies are attacking him in a major way.  But Anthony was excited because he's staying in the city tonight.  Because he's doing red-eye tonight.  So if you're up late or set it on your DVR, Ant will be on red-eye on Fox News tonight.  I think it's on, Travis, do you know, 2 a.m., 3 a.m.?  I think it's 2.30.  2.30?  I think.  Why not start it on the hour?  It's overnight.  What could possibly be stopping them from starting on the hour? 
[00:01:00]  I don't know.  Let's see.  3 a.m.  3 a.m., okay.  Okay.  It's on at 3 a.m.  Tonight, which is about when we wake up.  So we could wake up with Anthony.  But set your DVRs because it's always good.  He was very excited with Anthony because he's staying in the city because they film whenever they film in the evening.  And he's got a hotel room that's literally a block away from here.  So he was telling us, the entire staff, as we were working here, knowing that all of us will be here until deep into the afternoon, that he will literally be asleep within 10 minutes. 
[00:01:30]  Within 10 minutes of him saying that.  So he may already be asleep.  However, there was a little bit of controversy because Club Soda Kenny was kind of rushing Anthony out of the studio because he said he needed to go over to the hotel with Ant because the room was not ready yet.  Club Soda Kenny had been at the hotel maybe 20 minutes ago. 
[00:02:00]  And the room was not ready.  If Anthony Cumia gets to that hotel and has to wait for his room to be ready.  Because Ant's a guy who, you know what I mean, if this guy is staying at your hotel, you should make sure it's ready.  If he has to wait, he won't be a happy camper.  I would love it if Club Soda Kenny is listening to this in the car right now or if he can hear it wherever he is.  If he could call in later and give us an update whether or not Anthony got into his New York City hotel room. 
[00:02:30]  Because that's something everybody wants to know.  We had the magicians on today.  Lance Burton came in with all the teen magicians.  This is a documentary.  The people who did King of Kong and anybody who knows me and the things that I do on this channel, especially the special delivery show, knows that I love that movie.  I've become friends with Billy Mitchell, for God's sake.  But the people who made King of Kong have made this new make-believe.  That's what it's called.  The documentary is called Make-Believe, where they're going with these teen magicians who were looking to be the best teen magician. 
[00:03:00]  Who knew that the youth of America at this point even thought of magic as a hobby worth taking up?  But there is, thank God, a next generation of magicians coming up.  We saw them all today.  One of them was absolutely gorgeous.  The rest of them I didn't notice.  But the one was, Club Soda Kenny was in the hallway, as he always is, while this was all going on. 
[00:03:30]  He's the security guard of the show.  It's his job to sit in the hallway and make sure that nobody gets in here that's not supposed to.  The people who are in here don't act inappropriately.  And most importantly, no physical attacks go down towards Opie Anthony or Jim.  If something happened to me or E-Rock or Travis or whoever, it wouldn't matter.  That's not Club Soda Kenny's job.  But if there was a physical danger against any of the hosts, Club Soda Kenny would be here to protect them. 
[00:04:00]  So he's in the hall.  He's watching what's going on in the studio.  He's seeing the magic happen.  Literally.  The magic tricks happen.  And I noticed that after the segment was over, Opie, for his YouTube channel, was filming with Justin Bartha from The Hangover, who was in here today, and Club Soda Kenny, one of the young magicians, doing a trick.  Club Soda Kenny looked the opposite of impressed.  He looked as mundane as he always does. 
[00:04:30]  Just deadpan and just a long face with no expression on it.  So I figured we should talk to him and see what his impression was of all the magic that was going down today.  Club Soda, you just got to see some magic tricks in the studio.  Well, you probably weren't paying attention to what was going on in the studio.  There were magicians.  And you got to see some magic tricks in the hallway.  What did you think about the magicians?  Sam, a lot of people don't know that when I was younger, I wanted to be a magician. 
[00:05:00]  And I can do magic tricks.  Is that true?  Yes, it is true.  Can I see one?  Do you still know them?  Yeah, for instance, I could make my cock disappear in your mouth.  That's disgusting, Kenny.  It's a place of business.  You always say that.  Do you know any magic tricks or not?  If you don't like that one, how about, I could make my cock disappear in your ass. 
[00:05:30]  That's the same joke with a replaced body part.  And it's not a trick.  You know what my big finale is?  What?  I set my cock on fire and put it out in your mouth.  It's the same as the first trick, but with fire.  Of course.  It's, you know, the finale.  You don't know any magic, do you?  I do know a magician.  Is that true?  Yeah.  One time when I was driving, there was this beautiful girl hitchhiking. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah?  So I picked her up and I gave her a ride and we were chit-chatting.  Oh, cool.  And I asked her what she did for a living and she told me she was a magician.  And then she put her hand on my leg and I turned into a motel.  Oh, goodbye, Kenny.  Thank you.  The motel joke, you got to give credit to Kenny for.  The motel joke was somewhat clever.  Unfortunately, the four jokes, the, you know, the mouth, the anus, the fire mouth, and the motel joke, 
[00:06:30]  all four of those jokes were told literally seven times today.  As soon as Kenny found out that there were going to be magicians in studio,  that's the material that he unleashed on everybody.  I know Troy heard the jokes.  At one point, Roland was hearing the jokes.  I heard the jokes just then.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the jokes.  We've got a lot of EROC material to cover today.  There's a big story going on and we will talk about that.  I talked to Opie in the hallway before this show, after Opie and Anthony Live, 
[00:07:00]  to find out what happened because at the top of the show today,  he said that he had a phone conversation with EROC just last night.  I know that after the show, EROC was sending very rude messages to several different staff members.  We'll get into all that.  But on top of the magicians, Jim Jeffries was in studio today,  which, I mean, I think everybody, Travis, you'll back me up,  everybody on this staff, when we find out that Jim Jeffries,  number one, because he's never here, and number two, because he's hilarious, 
[00:07:30]  when we find out that Jim Jeffries is coming in, it's a treat of the day.  Yeah, Jim's definitely one of my personal favorites to have in.  And not only that, but you know you're not going to have a bad show when he's in.  There's no way he's never...  It's not possible.  Because, number one, he could be intoxicated.  We don't know.  And number two, he might be the most honest of...  I mean, this is a very honest show, and all the comedians are honest.  Jim Jeffries might be the most honest from coming in here and talking about his past as an opera singer, 
[00:08:00]  being molested as a kid.  He told us that he was afraid of bananas.  I mean, we scared him with bananas on one show.  He's an incredible talent and a wonderful person.  But Jim Jeffries, my possibly favorite, and it's hard to pick a favorite.  And I think he'll be back tomorrow.  He will.  I think so, yeah.  We also knew that Obi would ask him back, because he always does.  With Jim, it's like, we know if he's going to be in town.  If we book him for Thursday, then Obi will ask him back on Friday. 
[00:08:30]  So, I mean, it's a pretty smart booking to put him earlier in the week.  That way, he'll just be asked back as many days as he's free.  Well, he's never around.  You've got to take advantage of it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's the same thing with Bill Burr.  He's never here anymore.  So, when he is, let's get him in every day.  Let's take him.  My favorite, I think, Jim Jeffries appearance was one time he came in.  He was still drunk and, I mean, possibly had used other substances.  I don't know what they were, but there's a strong possibility that it was not just alcohol in his system. 
[00:09:00]  And he always amplifies everything.  Like, I knew that having the magicians in here doing magic on the radio, Obi and Anthony and Jim would make it work.  But having Jim Jeffries here, Jim Norton, of course, having Jim Jeffries here would take it to the next level.  And that's what happened here.  We had a porn star named Justine Jolie in.  Of course, Justine Jolie, the same woman who E-Rock smacked as hard as he could on the ass and got in a lot of trouble with his then-fiancée, now-wife, over. 
[00:09:30]  But this was when she was back in, Rich Voss was in.  She was promoting Caligula that she was doing off-Broadway, I guess.  And Jim Jeffries had his wits about him, even though he had a lot of his guard down.  He was inebriated, I would think.  And he lost a lot of filter.  And he usually doesn't have much of a filter.  He lost what little filter he had to the point where even Rich Voss would look at him like,  What are you saying right now? 
[00:10:00]  This is it.  Voss, Jim Jeffries on the O&A show with porn star, penthouse pet, Justine Jolie in the studio on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Jim, she wants you to get up so she can do the hoka-ho-ha dance.  Jim Jeffries will be doing the hoka-ho-ha dance with Justine Jolie.  This won't work out well for anyone.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's not.  You're kind of not coordinated.  It's pretty rancid.  You can get it through denim.  I don't know if I want to do it now. 
[00:10:30]  I'm a little scared.  Do the hoka-ho-ha.  Hoka-ho-ha.  Let's hoka-ho-ha.  Come on.  You're scared.  Let's see the hoka-ho-ha dance.  Let's do the hoka-ho-ha.  No, you got one more scene, Rich.  You're not done.  You got one more line at the hoka-ho-ha dance.  So you're actually going to do it with me here?  No, I won't do it.  She's got to learn it.  I will be.  He's got to learn it.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Here you go.  We need more room, so you got to scooch over.  As long as he gets on the internet, because I know how much I enjoy being appalling. 
[00:11:00]  This is the end part of the dance, where he's actually supposed to be grinding on me?  The end part is me spurting over your leg.  Really?  Wow, you did have a shit ton to drink last night.  Fuck.  I stink, don't I?  Holy fuck.  Wow.  My snot is like a rock of fucking coke.  I'm not doing the hoka-hoka with him anymore. 
[00:11:30]  Holy shit.  What's the matter?  Damn.  A little bit of booze?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've drunken too much.  You do porn.  Whose parents are more fucking disappointed?  Not mine.  All right.  Come on, hoka-hoka dance.  I already did, man.  I humped up on you.  That's part of the dance.  Don't lick me.  Don't lick me, you'll get drunk.  Oh, yeah, I will.  How the fuck did you drink last night?  Vodka?  Alcohol.  Obviously, alcohol. 
[00:12:00]  The dreams of young children.  It was St. Paddy's Day.  All right, do the hoka-hoka dance.  Come on.  Oh, she's done buttoning her shirt.  I know, because he's supposed to be humping back, and he's not.  You can touch those nipples all you want, but they're just dead bits of skin.  I know.  You don't really need them.  That is...  I'm trying to do the hoka-hoka, guys.  All I am is cock, testicles, and anus.  The rest of it is a dead zone.  Really?  Grind back on her a little bit.  Grind back.  She wants her to do the hoka-hoka. 
[00:12:30]  I don't even know...  I thought he's like, oh...  Do the hoka-hoka, you fool.  Wow.  Do you want a hoka-hoka?  Yes.  Hoka-hoka.  You hoka-hoka.  You hoka-hoka.  I don't know how to do it.  What, you think I'm fucking adept to these things?  Do the hoka-hoka with Justine Jolie.  You stick your big cock in, you pull your big cock out, you put your big cock in, and  you shake it all about.  Yeah.  You do the hoka-hoka.  You put your warts in, you turn around.  Then you don't give her a phone number. 
[00:13:00]  I just said I'd want your phone number.  Come on.  There's a lot of sexual tension between me and you.  I think you like me.  You're very cute.  I am cute, aren't I?  You are really fucked up right now.  Would you like to go on a date with me?  Me and you.  Come on.  Oh, man.  I have very small fists.  No, you don't.  Could you hand it to mine?  Because my hand's perfect.  Ooh, actually, he does have pretty decent hands for fisting.  Come on, come on, come on.  I assume...  Look.  I assume... 
[00:13:30]  They only overlap my...  And my hands are perfect for fisting.  I assume I could lose a watch in you.  Nothing I haven't done in a ton or anything.  What?  Nothing.  Was the last time you watched that motherfucker?  I watched it today.  I hope by not peeing on it.  No.  This is just awkward radio now.  Are you going to go out with me or not?  No more hopping?  All right.  If you think you're too good for me.  I didn't say I was too good for you.  I just said I didn't want to go out with you.  He has a gazebo.  I thought you have a really nice apartment.  I have a studio flat, which has a pungent smell that I can't find. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  But I'm going to endeavor to find that.  I wish you luck.  And then you'll get quite the raping.  Can't raping.  I'm just entertaining Anthony now.  That's fucking hysteria.  Yeah, right on.  You are un-fucking-believable.  I'm so fucking wasted. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  You stood up.  I don't even know.  Oh, there you go.  Erick brought it for you, not me.  I love you.  Mommy just brought you some juice.  And he's doing the hoka hoka with the fucking bottle now.  Yeah, now he's more interested in booze.  I love you.  I love you too, homie.  And I mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  How come?  Well, my mother never held me.  Oh.  No, she held me.  Just I didn't like her. 
[00:15:00]  It's just getting awkward.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  Why don't you want to be touched?  I know how I'm trying to tickle him to make him laugh.  He's cock, balls, anus, and all the rest is just a dead child.  It's just useless to laugh.  This is my theory on that.  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15.  But then after I got my dick sucked, I was over kissing.  I look at kissing like, why would I ride in the swings when I've already been to Disneyland?  Okay.  That makes perfect sense. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, you know what I mean?  I've had my cock sucked.  Kissing is down a dead zone for me.  No thrill.  What happened?  That's really unfortunate because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy about a man.  This is how we can change each other.  Being able to make out.  Yeah.  What?  We can change each other.  I don't even know what to fucking say to that at all.  He's like, we can make each other more respectable.  I'm more respectable as he takes him on this side. 
[00:16:00]  I'm telling you, you can't be happy with your life.  And look at me.  You think this is what I thought would happen?  Oh, no.  I can tell you're not so happy.  I'm a lot nicer off the radio.  Are you now?  Oh, so much nicer.  You really just are going for it, aren't you?  I think you'd enjoy going out with me.  I'm a very nice guy.  I can say no in separate languages.  I can say rape in one.  Ah, nice.  Shut down like crazy today. 
[00:16:30]  When you're stepping over his naked body, who would you fuck out of these guys?  You said I was cute before.  I think I was cute, right?  No, you are cute.  You're a very fun person.  I would love to get to know you as a friend, but I don't really...  Why am I not sexually attractive?  Do we need a mirror?  That should be the first thing you say every morning.  I don't think I have enough time to explain.  Is it the drug sweats?  No, it's the boo sweat. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, that's good.  As long as the boo sweat is killing out the drug sweats.  There's no one...  You can get high by licking my cheek.  There's no one...  Nice.  There's no one in this room that you would...  You would fuck.  Gotta be honest.  I don't always stink.  No.  No, no one in this room.  Well, you guys are all taken.  And you don't have open relationships.  No, no, no, let's not go.  Unless your wife calls me and says,  Hey, I don't want to sleep with you.  Believe me, it costs me tons of money to not have a fucking wife. 
[00:17:30]  The nearest thing I've got is Anthony.  Either way, like I said,  if I get a call from your significant other,  whoever that may be,  and she says it's okay that you two have discussed it  and you have an open relationship,  then it's on.  But otherwise, no, you guys are off limits.  His girlfriend's not allowed to use the phone  without permission.  Nice.  I didn't think so.  Do you let her at home?  Huh?  Do you let her use it at home?  Did you just say I'm rubbing your glue?  I'm implying that I'm fucking your daughter.  Shut up.  Oh, really?  My daughter would have to be manned her pussy to fuck you. 
[00:18:00]  I like how you dance around the subject.  Okay, which one?  The 17 or the 19-year-old?  No, no one.  No, no, no one.  I'm going to say the one that hasn't been born yet.  I guarantee if I was single and we met,  we'd go out.  Because I could tell.  I could tell.  I guarantee that she had a certain element of taste.  And I'm funny.  No, if you weren't seeing somebody,  I'm telling you,  because I used to bang girls like you all the time  and never call. 
[00:18:30]  I'm telling you.  I would be more likely to leave your bed long  before you'd kick me out, though.  I've had threesomes with two girls.  I prefer it if there's another guy.  I just like seeing a girl being degraded,  you know,  fucking pounded to shit.  Oh, degraded.  Oh, oh, he stopped himself before he said it.  I said degraded, you slut.  She's on Broadway or in the Lower East Side.  That was a joke.  That was just for joke purposes.  I'm sure you're not. 
[00:19:00]  That was a joke.  Come on.  That's a little joke.  That was funny.  Look, I've got a little accent.  Ooh.  And warps on your cock  and you wonder why you can't have a date.  What have I done?  What's going to happen?  Hey, Jim,  show her the woman you just banged recently.  Where's the picture?  Hold on.  We need two pages.  All right, all right.  Yeah, put those two pages back together.  Which one?  Blondie Briggs.  That's his story.  She's good looking.  It'd be really sad for you  because I'd take her home. 
[00:19:30]  Who, her?  If you needed a fucking mattress.  That means you'll get warts as well.  See, the problem with this picture,  there's no newspaper to see the date.  If you want to touch damaged goods,  go for your fucking life.  What do we got, two minutes?  Two minutes?  We got to plug everything.  Can you take clothes off now  because we've got two minutes.  I just want to see you naked.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were supposed to get naked.  Yeah, please. 
[00:20:00]  If you could.  Justine's play is Caligula  and it starts...  LaMama.org.  How do you spell it?  L-A-M-A-M-A?  That's correct.  And then don't forget  adultfriendfindernetworks.com  and justinejolie.com.  Look at those nice little breasts.  They're like raisins.  I want to put cornflakes on your chest.  Stop ruining it for me, Vos.  I know.  I'm like, why are you so mean?  Cornflakes?  Those are great.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing fishnet stockings  and I think it's actually called a fish.  34C?  Do you pluck your hairs off your nipples  before the show? 
[00:20:30]  That's really awesome.  No, I'm not like you, sweetie.  The fuck?  I don't need to go get, like, you know,  waxed and stuff, man-o-lander.  I'm only kidding.  I have so much thrush, it's unbelievable.  You might have the nicest ass I've seen.  Did I sponsor you as a kid?  No.  Wow.  But it's a good thing  I could take that dick out of your ass earlier.  Oh, aha.  Dick in the ass.  Yeah.  I mean, you love dick so much.  No, I just, I don't love it.  Didn't you just say  that you would love to suck cock?  Who wouldn't?  No, I don't want Rich Vos sucking my cock. 
[00:21:00]  No.  How am I going to get it?  I'm going to rest that stomach on my head.  It's not the homosexuality.  It's just your fucking chompers.  That's all friendfindernetworks.com.  lamama.org.  All right, everyone's got to get the fucks in.  All right, why don't we get the fuck out of here?  She's cute.  A nice girl.  She's not cute.  She's fantastic.  She's all right.  I mean, what the fuck?  Well, he's already got somebody else.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going to eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  I'll make sure to save a freshie for you. 
[00:21:30]  It's not a good thing for you.  Wait, let me be sexy like Rich Vos.  No, but it would be hilarious to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out with a knife.  It might be my favorite moment of any show when he said it's not going to be good for  you because I'm going to dig it out with a knife.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts, your host.  Opie and Anthony have fled, but we're all sticking around, keeping the channel alive  because we care.  I wish you cared as much as we do.  So I see, Travis, is the talking that you're doing in there, anything that can be made 
[00:22:00]  public?  No.  Not even close.  Okay.  I just figured I'd ask and then we'll move on.  Thank you for asking.  No.  Yeah.  Because we got other things to talk about anyway.  And I'm sure that it will all be eventually come to light.  Yeah.  One day.  One day.  Roland, where's Troy?  I want to talk to you.  Did you see his bus report on the news?  What's that?  The Bahamas just lifted up.  So somebody just left.  Oh!  You're making E-Rock jokes now.  No, that's the one that Sam, you wrote for me.  I don't write jokes for you, Roland, because you can't read. 
[00:22:30]  So what good would it do?  Wow.  It just came out of the air.  It hurts, doesn't it?  A little bit.  But Troy's coming in here because, I don't know, and I mean, if Danny heard any word from  E-Rock, although E-Rock doesn't talk to Danny, does he, Travis?  Or Troy, do you know, does Danny talk to, does E-Rock talk to Danny?  I think they probably try to keep it as minimal conversation between them.  Because anybody who heard from E-Rock should definitely come in here because.  I hope he has good travels and good free time. 
[00:23:00]  Yesterday's show went rough, as you all know, and we chronicled here on the after show.  He's going to Sam for a string that shit up.  So, I didn't stir anything up.  Of E-Rock.  How?  What did I stir up?  You're an asshole for doing that.  You're winking.  All right.  Well, Roland, you can say all you want, but it's all been on the air.  And I still have the CD of you I played yesterday.  So keep it up because we're playing it again.  Today's show is hilarious.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, E-Rock was called yesterday while the show was on.  E-Rock, as it turns out, he's not only on vacation. 
[00:23:30]  This is his honeymoon, as it turns out, which we didn't.  Were you aware of that?  I didn't know.  His wife was very angry at that.  And me?  Yeah.  Why me?  She said, fuck Sam.  Again, Roland, you're twisting this thing.  I'm just trying to get the facts out there for everybody.  I'm trying to tell you the facts.  I'm trying to tell you the facts.  And you were here yesterday when E-Rock was called.  Yes.  You were the phone screener, Troy.  Yes.  So you were the one calling him. 
[00:24:00]  I had to give the call.  And all of a sudden, E-Rock got very angry.  In fact, more angry than any of us expected at that.  Like, to me, I felt like what happened yesterday was not even as big as a lot of the stuff that's happened.  He got called.  He hung up immediately.  He got made fun of for about a half hour, give or take.  Roughly, yeah.  Then we went to break, did a little more.  We called him back.  And Anthony made whale noises for about four minutes.  Which was hysterical.  But Jamaican Jimmy is classic. 
[00:24:30]  Y'all loved what we did.  I love him.  What the?  I don't believe this.  The great Ron Bennington in this studio?  Nice to see you, Sam.  On this day?  It's good to see you.  I'm sorry I had to come in here a little early today.  No, you don't ever be sorry.  No.  I really didn't mean to, but we've got a guest coming in very, very early on in the show today.  So I've got to set up.  First of all, let me say thanks for having me on the show.  Well, you're the co-host now.  Well, I had no idea that I kind of, I've got so many radio shows now, don't I? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I guess this would be four.  Ronnie and Sammy Sweethearts is big.  By the way, there's a fifth secret show going on right now as we speak.  Which show?  It's a show that I'm doing that it looks like every show will be recorded.  It'll be a beginning, middle, and end.  But we won't put on the first show until the end actually happens in real time.  Well, I, uh...  Think of it almost as a radio documentary.  Wow.  Done in... 
[00:25:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Documentary or rockumentary?  It's probably a rockumentary because I'm going to be singing a lot.  Some of my, it's kind of a glee thing.  I get, oh wow, that's hot right now.  I don't know whether you know it, but you and I are involved in a ton of controversy.  Why are we involved in it?  We were just talking about E-Rock.  Uh, what's happening with you and I right now is a person, a.k.a. Laszlo, who has been  ringing my phone off the hook, just got off the phone with him recently.  As you know, he made disparaging remarks about me on the O&A show. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, he said you were full of shit if I remember correctly.  And I heard that from you.  He claims that you're making up some of that.  There's tapes.  But, here's the thing, he, I guess on this show yesterday, uh, we alluded to the fact  that we found out his real name.  Well, you, there was no we.  You didn't allude to it.  You went on the air and said his name.  Okay.  That was what that was.  So, whatever.  The thing is, that's details and we're not going to fucking play a lot of time worrying  about the details.  It's big picture stuff right now. 
[00:26:30]  But what's happening, here's the deal.  This frightens him because he can hide behind his fucking wizard.  I'm Ron Bennington.  Yeah.  I make no, that's my fucking Christian name, as they say.  You're Sammy Sweetheart.  Sammy Sweetheart.  Born Sammy Sweetheart.  Everybody knows that.  So, we live in a world of honesty.  Yeah.  I guess AK Laszlo does not.  Wow.  But not only that, as he's trying to fix this thing, uh, he keeps bringing up Fez and  I'm like, that's between you and Fez. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, you call, yeah, if he's going to call you a puppet master, you can't then turn  around and now be his moderator.  Right.  It's got to go one way or another.  Yeah.  Not only that, but a, uh, comedian, a legendary comedian yesterday also called me a puppet  master.  Kurt Loder?  Uh, no, I wish it was Kurt Loder, but Kurt couldn't make it.  Uh, apparently there was a huge MTV news story broke and he had to jump on a plane.  Oh, I should have watched.  And go to Abbey Road.  Wow.  I believe he was going to go live from Abbey Road. 
[00:27:30]  Uh, but it is, um...  Well, who was the comedian?  Well, I, Bobby Slayton.  Bobby Slayton said, I...  He called you a puppet?  So this is now three different people since AKA Laszlo started that.  The puppet master thing is starting to stick to me.  I'm not going to call people at home and cry about it.  Just whatever.  This is something I'm going to have to deal with.  Uh, also, of course, uh, Bobby Slayton had to apologize to Lisa Lampanelli about things  that were said.  What was said?  He, I guess he acted like Lisa was not only, you know, derivative of his act. 
[00:28:00]  I, you know, no one can understand Slayton.  So, but Bobby Slayton then has a history of making accusations.  I don't know that.  I don't know that at all.  I know he did have to apologize on Twitter.  Wow.  Uh, and that's all up on 202 Friends.  The entire thing that he...  What's 202 Friends?  Uh, 202 Friends is a, uh, is a Twitter name.  Remember we used to be 202?  Oh, that's right.  Uh, right now I'm into retro stuff.  Oh, okay.  So, uh, that's happening.  But you'll, now you and I squashed everything between, now, you know what, I'm going to 
[00:28:30]  give it to the three of us.  It was you and I and Rob Cross squashed all the problems between Laszlo, I mean, not Laszlo,  Roland and Fez.  Yeah.  Now we're back into a world where, hey, maybe we're not all best friends.  But at least we're all on a good co-working basis.  Yeah.  Professionals.  Uh, Roland's not...  His name was drugged back into this by Laszlo.  Are you kidding me?  A.K.A.  Laszlo.  You talk about shit-stirring. 
[00:29:00]  He brought up Roland's name because he knows that that could, he could get some heat off  himself.  Right.  And then he...  What does Roland have to do with this?  I, uh, you'll have to check with A.K.A.  Laszlo.  But, Laszlo, of course, is heading to Greece for two weeks.  How convenient.  I know.  He's going to miss the full assault.  Now, when he gets back...  International assault.  Yeah.  Well, I guess, yes, this is an international broadcasting system, isn't it?  What's up, Canada?  Uh, Canada and parts of, uh, Bermuda. 
[00:29:30]  I got a call from Bermuda one day.  Wow.  Yeah.  The guy said, why can't we hear you here?  But it doesn't matter.  The point is this.  It's out there.  It's happening.  That's huge.  So, this is where we are, and I wish we weren't.  I wish we weren't.  Did you hear about what's going on with E-Rock?  Talk to me.  Because that's the other controversy, that E-Rock, uh, he's on vacation.  Uh-huh.  He's in the Bahamas, I guess.  No, when you say E-Rock, do you mean Sex Bagel?  That's right.  Okay.  I'm glad that that name is picking up again.  Yeah.  Sex Bagel is on vacation. 
[00:30:00]  Uh, and I guess it's his honeymoon.  He didn't tell people.  He's just on vacation.  We find out now it's his honeymoon.  Right.  We called him on the air yesterday, and he got really pissed.  At first, and Troy's our phone screener.  At first, he wouldn't...  At more.  Come on.  Well, you know, from six to ten, phone screener.  Okay.  But, uh, he wouldn't pick up the phone.  He said, hello.  Opie and Anthony said, hey, E-Rock.  He hangs up.  Opie and Anthony end up making fat jokes for about a half hour.  Right.  That's neither here nor there. 
[00:30:30]  So, he calls...  We call him over and over again, and then, Troy, you ended up calling him in the next  segment because Opie said...  Opie and Anthony both said what to you?  Make sure you get him back on the air.  They said that was your only job, right?  Right.  I had tried once, and they didn't answer, and then Opie had commented on the air, your  job is to make sure that you get him on the air.  So, Troy being the good professional...  Yeah.  He got him on the air.  And E-Rock said, what do you guys want?  And Anthony spent four minutes making whale noises into the megaphone. 
[00:31:00]  Megaphone?  Yeah.  Into the thing.  I didn't know that was so-called a megaphone.  Well, Jimmy Hart always called it a megaphone.  All I know is what Jimmy Hart and Gorilla Monsoon call it.  Hey, that's not for me.  Yeah.  But, uh...  So, E-Rock hung up, and we all said, all right, we got E-Rock.  We just thought it was another E-Rock joke.  He started texting people and messaging people on this staff, uh, immediately following the  show all afternoon, telling everyone how pissed he was.  He said, I'm done.  And what did he say to you, Troy? 
[00:31:30]  He said, fuck you.  Now, did he say that by text, or did he...  Yes, he said that by text.  On Facebook, right?  On Facebook.  He gave him a Facebook message.  You don't know the way that that was in my mind, but like, friendly fuck you.  Like, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I didn't interpret it as...  I took it as he was really upset, still.  Like, it was an attack.  Yes.  And then he told...  And then he was on with Roland, who he was pissed off at, because Roland was laughing  at him, and I recorded him laughing and played it.  Um, he was all pissed that Roland was laughing at him, and, uh, he told Roland, fuck all of 
[00:32:00]  you.  I'm done.  I'm finished.  I'm done with all this.  And we're all going, what happened?  How can we have a 202...  We don't have a 202.  ...without sex bagel.  Yeah, it's a good point.  Sex bagel is the virus.  I mean, that's the whole thing.  Uh, Opie, however, came to the rescue.  Good.  And E-Rock called him, uh, and Opie explained this at the beginning of ONA.  E-Rock called him, and at first, Opie wouldn't take his calls at home. 
[00:32:30]  And then E-Rock texted him.  Opie doesn't need to be bothered.  Yeah.  And so...  In his personal time.  Opie finally, uh, talked to him.  Um, I want to play this clip because, uh, I talked to Opie in the hallway, because he  just touched on the E-Rock thing on the air and moved on quickly.  I didn't think that was enough E-Rock time.  Sex bagel time.  So this is, uh, Opie explaining with Kenny, of course, what happened, uh, with the sex bagel.  You know what?  Sam, does he have to?  I mean, he doesn't have to.  It's his deal, but I'd love to talk to Opie.  What would you like to talk to him about? 
[00:33:00]  You know I want to talk about E-Rock.  You know what?  I will talk to the shit-stirer.  What do you got?  I'm not a shit-stirer.  I'm a reporter.  I'm just trying to get everything on the table for everyone to see.  No, Sam, I agree about the shit-stirer.  Well, nobody's talking to you, Kenny.  The whole place is talking about how you're a shit-stirer.  Listen.  I don't even know if we're friends anymore.  We are friends.  What did you say to E-Rock to calm him down?  Because he's messaging people yesterday, talking like he's going to quit the company  because you called him on vacation.  You meaning the show, not you personally. 
[00:33:30]  And all of a sudden, by the time the night comes, he's tweeting jokes at his own expense.  Well, he called my house.  I guess we dealt with this on the show today, but he called my house a bunch of times,  and I would just answer the phone and hang up.  That old trick.  And then finally he texted me and just wrote,  Really?  And then I was honestly scared to talk to E-Rock for the first time.  I think ever.  Why were you scared?  Because I heard that he was motherfucking everybody.  Yeah, he was.  And I knew he was really, really pissed off. 
[00:34:00]  So I finally just texted him, what's up?  And he finally called me back.  And I diffused it right away.  I'm like, you're not going to believe how great that was yesterday.  People are talking about it.  People are saying it's one of the best bits we've done in months.  Oh, my God.  And when Jimmy did that Jamaican fucking character and put it over the top, it was unbelievable.  And then the whale sounds, when you finally picked up later in the show and we just talked to you like you were a whale with whale sounds.  That was hilarious.  The listeners are just talking about it like it was unbelievable. 
[00:34:30]  And then he couldn't yell anymore.  So he made it seem like he deserved some of the credit for that?  Yeah, then he completely downplayed why he was calling.  Like, oh, well, yeah, I guess it was all right.  Are you serious?  Oh, yeah, totally twisted it on him.  Because when I got a hold of him, he wanted to just yell and scream at me and threaten to quit and all that crap, which I would have just said, whatever.  We'll just get another Iraq we can beat up.  Because all day he was texting people and messaging people and saying how pissed he was. 
[00:35:00]  Do you think he was maybe overreacting?  No, he was really, really pissed off.  Because we found out that this is like a delayed honeymoon.  He's on his honeymoon and we're calling him up to bust his balls.  And he did say that he had a late night of drinking and partying with his wife.  So by the time we called him, he was only in bed for a few hours and he was very hungover and tired.  He doesn't drink around us anymore ever since the paycheck incident, the description of which is no longer in the system.  I don't know what Iraq did with that file.  Oh, really?  He's deleting files, huh? 
[00:35:30]  We think so, because we can't find the description of the paycheck incident.  The funny thing is, you've got to get Roland laughing again about this.  Do you want to hear the long clip?  I heard it.  But Roland came over to my apartment last night to drop off this really just crappy, boring documentary.  I won't even name the documentary at this point.  But we were going over the whole Iraq bit at my apartment.  He was laughing so hard. 
[00:36:00]  I thought he was going to drop dead of a heart attack.  And I'm like, aren't you Iraq's best friend around here?  Yeah, but it was hilarious.  He texted me yesterday out of nowhere and just said, ha, ha, ha, listening to the replay.  Yeah, he loved it.  So you definitely got to get him on to just start laughing again because he laughs to the point you really think he's going to drop dead.  All right, well, I'll let you get back to your business.  But, yeah, I smoothed it over with Iraq.  He'll be fine.  Way to go.  Until next time we beat the shit out of him and he takes it again.  So I don't know what it was about magical Opie's words, but all of a sudden Opie talks to him. 
[00:36:30]  And not only is Iraq not pissed anymore, but now he's tweeting.  He likes the ice cream and tweeting a picture of ice cream like he's doing the jokes and being self-deprecating about it as if he didn't spend the entire day.  Troy, what was it?  He texted you again?  Fuck you.  And what did you say?  I just said, why are you mad at me?  Yeah, you said you should be mad at the whole show.  Yeah.  And what did he say?  Some bullshit response.  Probably fuck all of you, right? 
[00:37:00]  He's sick of it.  This asshole.  A big part of this is Sex Bagel knows that he's got the special delivery show anytime he wants.  And that kind of leaves that door open for him, you know?  Like he doesn't need ONA.  He doesn't need ONA because he's got another gig.  He's got another full-time gig.  Full-time for Saturdays?  Well, for now.  For now.  Have you heard things?  I hear rumblings.  Wow.  Well, they're setting up.  You got a big guest today?  Today's Literary Day.  As you know, I'm a literary person. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  We had two authors coming in.  One wrote a wonderful book called Talking to Girls about Duran Duran.  But the other one says, my boyfriend wrote a book about me.  And this is a young woman whose boyfriend wrote a book at her talking about her fat ass.  So this is her getting back.  It kind of plays in, like, she's the sex bagel of this entire story she writes for the TV show community.  It's a very funny book.  Oh.  It's a hit show.  It is a hit show.  I mean, she's got a lot going for her. 
[00:38:00]  I think it's bigger than The Voice.  I also, also going on Twitter, it's bigger than The Voice.  Well, that takes an accomplishment.  Yesterday, I almost thought that me and Anthony were going to get into a Twitter war.  Uh-huh.  Because Justin Stengel of the infamous Stengel Brothers.  Right.  The Letterman crew.  Mm-hmm.  He was giving away a mug on Twitter and said, whoever says hi to him and has the most followers by 6 p.m. gets to keep the mug.  And so I thought with my 21 thou, I would be walking home with the mug. 
[00:38:30]  An hour later, Anthony Cumia says, hi, Justin Stengel.  And I go, look at, but we were both ousted by some guy with 1.3 million.  Who the hell's that?  I don't know.  Some guy who invested in Twitter.  Apparently, the Stengel brothers are much more popular than we realize.  No, they're incredibly big.  I think he's one of the biggest people that ever made Fez cry.  Justin Stengel is.  Yeah.  He was really concerned that day.  I talked to him.  He was like, dude, did I really make Fez cry?  I didn't mean to.  We're going to get Justin Stengel's real name out on the air.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Watch out, Stengel.  We're coming for you next.  Ron, we've got to let you get to your interview.  We've got to get out of here on time.  So we'll leave you with, first, I'm going to hit the sounds of Roland laughing.  And then we're going to go to Shauna Lanay.  We mentioned it on the show today.  Shauna Lanay walking out crying.  She was a porn star.  She didn't like the sight of her own porn, so she cried and walked out of the studio.  But first, this is E-Rock's best friend who works here, Roland, for about a minute and a half, 
[00:39:30]  laughing hysterically at E-Rock's tragedies and us calling him on his honeymoon.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are next, and after Opie and Anthony live and Opie and Anthony return tomorrow.  This is disgusting.  One week off from being called a bastard all day.  I'm singing. 
[00:40:00]  One week off from being called a bastard.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. Why are you doing this to me? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, shit. The ice cream?  Oh, shit. I'm too much. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, shit. That's the best thing I've ever heard all week long. Ah, Jesus.  I don't know. Wow. You don't like that one, huh? No, can you please change that? No, it's not because it's not a flattering picture. Of course it is.  What better photo a person? You need to put up this picture. Look how pretty. Yeah, that is. This is a good picture right here. Yeah. You guys are so bad. Yeah, you guys are really mean. 
[00:41:30]  No, no, no, no. No, you really are.  I swear to God, actually. Am I being mean? Yeah, you're being great. Fuck. What did I do? Really? I want to be serious for a second.  What did I do that would mean? Because I was just like interviewing you in the way I would interview somebody that does adult films.  Yeah, I realize that. All right, I'm sorry. I apologize. Do you feel Anthony was too harsh in his descriptions? 
[00:42:00]  Um, I just would rather be seen as a penthouse pet today and not an... Okay. Don't film hardcore sex addicts.  Oh, my God. Don't get upset with me. I can't take it. I got too many fucking girls upset with me today. Enough of this shit.  Why are people upset with you too? Why are people upset with you too? Why?  Why? Because I must be a fucking asshole.  There's enough big juicy cock for all. Yeah.  Yeah, that's true. I think you're stunningly attractive.  Well, I'm here promoting my penthouse magazine for March 2009. Everybody check it out. Thank you. 
[00:42:30]  Shit, did I fuck this up? No, you didn't. It's all salvageable.  Wait, she's pissed, Anthony. Everything was fine before. It was fine before.  It was fine, but then I screwed all up. Can we go back to when it was all fine?  Yes, we can. I didn't screw it up. I've been getting pissed off for like 20 minutes now.  Are you shitting me? No kidding. What part got you?  No kidding. What part got you?  Like, you guys make me feel like a little girl and you keep calling me cute. And then you make me feel like so dirty.  No. Like, you really, you guys do. You're making me feel gross and young and a little girl. 
[00:43:00]  Well, you got a huge cock in your mouth. What are we supposed to do?  No, no. That is unnecessary. It really is. That is really unnecessary.  We don't know. We're getting to know you. My hands aren't on the computer at all.  Yeah, well, who's in? That would be Danny. Danny has no problem.  Okay, can we stop? Danny pops him up there.  I have to say, I think you're being a little sensitive about it.  No, I mean, I don't. Jimmy.  I'm not here promoting come on my face right now. I'm here promoting.  No. Well, it looks like you're just looking like a...  That isn't even why I'm here promoting. This is stuff that you've done in your career, right?  This isn't what I'm promoting today. I understand, but it's something that you've done. It's in your past. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, but again, she's not promoting that today. This is not what I'm promoting. This is not from Penthouse.  All right, but if we had De Niro in studio, we'd be talking about Raging Bull and Dog Day after...  Well, Penthouse?  Can I be honest? I think one reason, though, you've got to say this, is the video that was on the council council for me when I got here...  Yeah.  ...was a penthouse. It's called Bring Me the Head of Shawna Linnae. So it is a penthouse video.  Yes, and you're promoting penthouse.  Well, she's promoting penthouse. But she's saying that's not penthouse.  That is not penthouse. We're not promoting that stuff today. 
[00:44:00]  The radio audience cannot see that. All they hear is our descriptions.  Well, I hope not.  How could the radio audience see it?  No, no, they don't see it. They don't see it.  So what they hear is us describing scenes which are sexy of you, which makes people want to go out and buy a movie.  I didn't know if she was getting mad for 20 minutes.  30 minutes.  3, 2, 1...  I thought I was doing very well with you.  Wow.  Seeing from Arthur. It's funny.  Yeah, Anthony was really digging you.  Let's talk about Rock and Love Bus.  I thought it was like...  Can we talk about what we're supposed to be talking about?  Let's talk about Rock and Love Bus. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, you really are starting to... you're even starting to annoy me, and I'm very easy.  Hey, Jimmy.  I've got to be honest, I'm very tolerant, but this...  The penthouse video, we're promoting penthouse as a brand.  Yeah.  Talking about hardcore stuff, saying that pictures are very sexy.  And, you know, come on.  You guys were not putting sexy pictures up there.  They're hardcore sex shots.  You guys were picking up the worst pictures you guys could find and putting them up there.  No, it's kind of hot.  Yeah, you were.  I swear, I swear...  He was putting up just dirty pictures, which we don't ever say.  They're very sexy.  No, they were not.  They're very sexy and very hot.  I swear. 
[00:45:00]  No, they are.  They're very sexy.  Looking back to stuff.  Hey, stop it.  It was nice.  I was saying, they're very sexy.  Yeah.  You're a very pretty girl, and I didn't mean to, you know...  Those pictures were not...  So you guys picked out, like, seriously, like, oh, awesome, thanks.  I'm out.  Stop!  Oh, what happened?  Oh, my God.  I knew it.  I fucking knew it.  It's a picture.  Why are you guys doing this?  To be honest, I gotta say, what is wrong...  It's just her sucking on a big black ball bag of the black gentleman.  Exactly. 
[00:45:30]  With it.  The O.P. & Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O.N.A. show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash O.P. & Anthony.  And catch O.P. & Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Mine and Fez are next.  Hey!  On The Virus.  No.  Well, I love to see you guys.
