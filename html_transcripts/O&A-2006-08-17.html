<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM radio show, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, began with the hosts engaging in vulgar self-deprecating humor and transitioning into equally irreverent banter about a weather map.  A major portion of the broadcast focused on the arrest of John Mark Carr in Thailand in connection with the JonBenét Ramsey case.  The hosts discussed the arrest details, Carr's confession, speculated on his motivations and past, including alleged child pornography charges, and criticized the media's coverage, using frequent offensive language and graphic descriptions.  They then discussed a caller's attempt to "wow" garbage men, leading to a conversation about the "wow" movement and their own experiences in Thailand, with further calls offering perspectives on Thailand and the Ramsey case.  A significant segment detailed Club Soda Kenny's disastrous, poorly-attended gentlemen's club appearance, playing audio of Kenny's despondent account interspersed with mocking commentary.

The show also covered a news story about a woman causing a plane diversion (initially reported as a terrorist threat), Innetta the Mood Setter's on-air resignation (with audio), and the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus tour.  They discussed using Paltalk cameras, YouTube videos of past shows, and a woman's three-year self-portrait project.  Don Imus's criticism of the show, specifically a bit involving a deaf reporter (which Imus misrepresented), was addressed, with Opie and Anthony playing Imus's segment and responding with counter-arguments and jokes, referencing Whoopi Goldberg's past studio visit and contrasting their willingness to engage in conflict with Howard Stern's perceived inability to handle ribbing.  They heavily criticized Howard Stern's absence from Gary Dell'Abate's father's funeral and the ensuing fan backlash, including a listener calling in with her boyfriend's perspective on Stern's justifications.  The Miss Teen USA pageant was reviewed, focusing on the apparent age discrepancies between contestants' actual ages and their mature appearances, particularly in swimsuits, playing clips of what the hosts considered inane answers.  The show featured phone calls with Bob Saget (a chaotic call with a bad connection and an impromptu interaction with a woman Saget jokingly called the "ugliest woman" he could find) and Bob Kelly, both promoting their comedy shows; a listener also called in with positive feedback on Kelly's performance.  Imus's commentary was referenced throughout this segment.

Fatboy Slim appeared as an in-studio guest, promoting his greatest hits CD and DVD, also conducting a "walkover" to give away copies outside the studio. Opie mentioned his upcoming Hammerstein Ballroom show.  Humorous moments included Fatboy Slim's promotional team giving Opie ill-fitting "slim fit" jeans, teasing Fatboy Slim about inaccuracies in his biography (claiming he produced for Madonna and U2), and discussing his career, music ("buttery beats"), and dislike of breakfast radio.  Callers criticized the hosts' interviewing skills and shared anecdotes about Fatboy Slim's *Cribs* appearance.  There was discussion of his beach party preference over NYC gigs, his success in Japan, and playful accusations of drug use from the hosts. Fatboy Slim revealed a preference for older music over his own work.  A caller's question about his video with Christopher Walken led to discussion of the video and Walken's personality;  Fatboy Slim's *Letterman* appearance was also promoted. The "walkover" featured interactions with people on the street, including a homeless man and a man resembling Mark David Chapman; Opie received a "Yankees Suck" t-shirt.  The post-walkover discussion included further comments on Fatboy Slim and audio clips of Bob Kelly's appearances on CNN and Spike TV (commenting on Britney Spears and a contentious interview), concluding with off-color jokes and banter.

The show continued with a discussion of Britney Spears' career and a recent online video, speculating on its impact and future.  This segued into a phone call with Bob Kelly, who recounted an awkward television appearance and discussed upcoming shows, including vulgar jokes.  The conversation shifted to John Carr, expressing disgust and anger at his actions and discussing the treatment of child predators in prison.  A significant portion focused on a listener's audio of JV and Elvis (from a post-Opie and Anthony show) making derogatory comments about Roz from *Last Comic Standing*, with JV and Elvis attempting to deflect blame onto Opie and Anthony; the hosts reacted to this audio.  Listener calls discussed the Ron and Fez situation, the JV and Elvis situation, the Troy Lee Gentry bear-killing incident, and included audio of a 1970s baseball announcer accidentally using the word "cock" on air. A listener gifted Opie a chemical warfare outfit.  The show concluded with further discussion about the John Ramsey case and show promotions, including crude language and offensive humor.

Finally, a segment featured numerous listener calls. Robert discussed his wife's newfound fandom, including sending a stuffed dolphin and receiving a response.  The JonBenét Ramsey case was discussed again, with callers offering theories and referencing graphic details.  Listener feedback on show commercials was addressed, criticizing animated caricatures and discussing a new live-action commercial.  Rob discussed a wedding scheduling conflict, leading to a humorous exchange and ticket offer.  A caller discussed the upcoming *Letterman* appearance, anticipating discussion of past controversies ("voyeur bus," "Sex for Sam"). Another caller delivered a scathing, vulgar critique of the hosts.  A caller sought advice about her fiancé's unusual marriage condition involving the show, and a final listener commented on the hosts' relationship with Ron and Fez.  The broadcast mentioned Patrice O'Neill, Patty, and Drew Boogie as guests for the next show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Bark, bark.  You beast.  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog. 
[00:01:30]  I will teach you the meaning of the word, respect.  Hey, where are the white women at?  We're taking the nuttion!  Pitch in the hole!  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Good morning.  Howdy. 
[00:02:00]  I'm just looking at a weather map with lots of stuff going on.  Yep.  I'm just making sure none of that stuff starts spinning.  Oh.  Because I'm kind of going to be in that general area where the red stuff is on the weather map.  Yeah.  But as long as it doesn't start twirling around, you should be okay.  Did you see that map, though?  Yeah, a lot of red stuff.  A lot of stuff that wants to start spinning. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of junk.  And one of those things is going to start spinning.  No.  See, I need to be a weather guy.  You see all this stuff.  One of these things.  If something starts spinning, there's going to be trouble.  One of these things is going to start spinning.  And it's going to cause havoc in about ten days from now.  Well, you couldn't be any worse than our buddy Mike.  Over there on...  Mike Woods.  Mike Woods.  Yeah.  We were watching him again this morning.  It's just become something we have to do. 
[00:03:00]  You've got to watch this guy because he is so bad.  At anything but just standing there and doing the weather.  When he stands there and does the weather, it's okay.  The second he gets a distraction of any kind, it's over, Johnny.  Over.  And we were watching him.  They asked him a simple question.  Like, what did you do last night?  Or just something.  And he lost his mind.  It's like, you mean me?  What?  Who?  What?  What?  Do yesterday?  What?  It was like he was the guy accused of the JonBenet Ramsey thing. 
[00:03:30]  He just went...  Nothing.  I was out.  I mean home.  I loved her very much.  What?  And then he was so thrown at the conversation they were having before the weather that when  he got to the weather, he said, well, it smells great out this morning.  It looks great out this morning.  He was just in a tizzy.  I love this guy.  He cannot be distracted.  We get here around five to start preparing for this radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Believe it or not.  And now we just stare at the TV.  And as soon as he pops on the screen, we're like, Mike Wood's on.  We stop everything to see what kind of babble comes out of his mouth next.  Great.  And you know this bitch just on purpose, she throws him questions out of left field.  You think?  Yes.  I think now she's trying to just lob him easy questions and he can't even handle the easy  questions.  She asked him, what did you do yesterday?  Because it was so nice out.  And he was just like...  Look at that creep's pants. 
[00:04:30]  All pulled up.  Oh, is he another creep?  The JonBenet Ramsey guy from Thailand.  Off with this guy's head.  Why are we going to bother with this?  Why is he talking to the media?  What a dope one.  They're walking him out.  Ah, she died accidentally.  I know.  That'll be great for the defense lawyer.  Ew, whose arm is he holding?  What they did, I guess they did a little perp walk with him over in Thailand.  Right.  When they were coming to get him.  And he sat down in front of the press. 
[00:05:00]  That's before any lawyers can get to him.  You know, he's over in Thailand.  They don't know.  So he sits down and starts yapping, saying, I was with JonBenet when she died.  But it was an accident.  And then there's some other stories about how he felt that they were in love.  And there was like this whole relationship thing.  Oof.  And just, by the way, the creepiest looking guy.  His pants are pulled up like William Frawley pants.  You have Fred Mertz pants. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Hey, where's little Ricky?  Don't leave him with Mrs. Trumbull.  I'll take him, Rick.  You go to the club.  Lucy, go to some chocolate factory and I'll stay here.  What a mess.  Yeah, his pants are way pulled up.  His buttons are right up to Adam's apple on his shirt.  And then he's sitting there and his eyes are darting back and forth.  He's got crazy guy eyes.  From side to side.  Yeah, side to side.  And he goes, yeah, I was with JonBenet when she died, but it was an accident. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  What were you playing?  Chutes and ladders.  And all of a sudden, a Garrett wrapped around her neck, choked her, and her head was caved in by one of the playing pieces.  What a creep this guy is.  Well, someone made the point in the office, maybe he's up on some pretty sick charges over there in Thailand.  Yeah, which he was.  And they're not as nice as we are over here.  So he's like, ah, I killed JonBenet.  I did it.  Bring me back to the U.S., please. 
[00:06:30]  Bring me back to the U.S.  I did it.  And then he'll say he didn't do it just to get away from Thailand.  I think he just wants out of that country because, what, he's brought up on kiddie porn and all that over there?  If you're going to Thailand, you should be arrested.  You know how hard it is to be brought up on kiddie porn charges in Thailand?  You know what you've got to do over there?  But when you are, oh, my God.  That's what I'm saying.  Whatever they do.  If you're going to Thailand, you should just be arrested.  If you're a ticket, you're at the airport, where are you going?  Thailand.  Please arrest this man. 
[00:07:00]  Because he's either going there for kids or to bring back drugs.  Yeah, they're getting away with murder over there.  Unless maybe you're dressed like a mercenary.  I've got to go take out one of the leaders over there or something.  It's a CIA thing.  Please don't even ask me another question about it.  Every once in a while, you get that person in your life and, ah, I'm going to Vietnam.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm going to Vietnam.  I'm going to crawl around in the holes. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to check this out.  I'm going to check that out.  I'm a war buff.  And I'm going to go to Vietnam to check out everything.  The old Viet Cong tunnels.  Yeah.  That's like a tourist attraction, apparently.  People go there now.  And they go into the Viet Cong tunnels and see what they were like.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  But every once in a while, someone will come up to you.  That's where they're going to go on vacation.  And you look at them like, what are you into, really?  You know what Vietnam's all about, too.  You're not a war buff.  There's just a kid sex trade going on in Southeast Asia. 
[00:08:00]  It's just a known thing.  That's what happens.  You go there pretty much with impunity and do whatever you want until, you know, something  high profile like this pops up.  But apparently they've been tracking this guy for a while.  Now the stories have got to come out of how he had a relationship with a family, how he  had access to her.  There's a picture of him with the whole family in the Daily News, so obviously he knew the  whole family.  I think that's his family, is it?  Or is that?  I'm not sure. 
[00:08:30]  No, that's the Ramseys.  That's the Ramseys?  Yeah.  And he's with them?  Yeah.  I think that's him.  Well, then there's a problem.  Then there's a connection.  They wanted to know when he was going to Thailand.  They looked in his suitcase and they found two laptops and a whole bunch of lollipops.  They're like, what are you going to do?  He said, oh, the cultural ministry.  I'm going to look at museums.  Pickle me up, Moe doll.  Well, you know.  Find some war dead.  Are you?  Oh, what creeps.  Yeah, he is a real ghoul.  I don't know if that's him pictured with the family. 
[00:09:00]  It says, John Mark Carr has been arrested in murder of Jean Benet Ramsey photo right.  So that's him to the right.  And then it says, I left the smiles of the Ramsey family.  I don't know.  I think what the Daily News is trying to do is show that they're all connected, but they  don't have an actual picture of them connected yet.  Oh, maybe not.  I thought that was him 10 years ago.  You think that the older guy there?  In the picture, he looks at the guy standing next to Jean Benet's father.  Oh, and then it says, at left, the smiles of the Ramsey family. 
[00:09:30]  Maybe that's not him.  Yeah, I don't know if it's him, to be honest with you.  The Ramsey family.  Well, here's the latest on the case.  Everyone's going to be talking about this today.  It's on the front page of most newspapers in America.  John Mark Carlisi.  Did he shorten it to John Mark Carr?  Because I know Steve occasionally did that through his career with Foundry.  Here's the latest.  A 41-year-old American man is in custody in Thailand in connection with the death of John  Benet Ramsey.  Her death was an accident.  Boulder County's District Attorney's Office received information that a subject was providing 
[00:10:00]  information and might be connected to the murder of John Benet Ramsey.  Upon investigation, we were able to identify that subject, and that is John Mark Carr.  He was arrested yesterday.  The investigation continues.  He'll be removed to the United States within the next week.  John Mark Carr's arrest was a surprise breakthrough in the almost 10-year-old murder case. 
[00:10:30]  The 6-year-old beauty queen was found strangled and beaten in the basement of the family home  in Boulder, Colorado in December 1996.  Thai officials say the man has confessed.  He asked my officer that what he's charged.  Mao.  The officer said that you are charged with a first-degree murder.  He said, no, not first-degree, second-degree.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  He said, second-degree is not first-degree because it's not intentionally.  Not intentionally.  After a caning. 
[00:11:00]  Wow, they're sick over there.  You agreed to...  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Oh, that has got to be scary.  You know, it's scary enough.  You watch on MSNBC sometimes.  They do those specials on the prisons.  Yeah.  It's like, let's take you inside a prison in Kentucky.  Right, right.  And it's just the most awful thing.  The guards bursting in with those stun shields and everything.  And it just looks awful and keeps me out of jail, you know, those shows.  But I could not imagine being in a place like Thailand or Turkey or something like that 
[00:11:30]  and going, okay, now, give this country's justice a little try.  Ended up in jail over there.  Oh, I think of it the other way.  I think a child porn charge in Thailand is like getting a parking ticket over here.  Oh, you think the whole place is full of them?  They're like, what are you in for?  Ah, well.  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'll give you two guesses.  Yeah.  Officials connected with the case say Carr has revealed some facts in the case that were 
[00:12:00]  never made public.  Carr is a former school teacher who once lived in Conyers, Georgia.  The Ramseys lived in Georgia until John Bonet was a year old.  A man named John M. Carr once taught at this school in Sonoma County, California.  He lost his teaching credentials in 2002 after an arrest for child pornography.  This woman lived near Carr at the time.  I know that his wife said that he had gone to prison because he was caught. 
[00:12:30]  They came and got his computer.  There was a lot of pornography.  Pornography.  Police say John Carr is expected to be brought back to the U.S. in the coming days.  There you go.  My goodness.  That's got to be great to be the wife of that guy.  Hey, you got yourself a prize there, did you?  You had three kids, right?  Three kids, a wife, and they got divorced.  I'd love to see some of the documents in that divorce case.  Ex-school teacher. 
[00:13:00]  Yep.  They always like putting themselves in situations where they could be around the kids.  Well, now people are defending Thailand.  Probably because their wives are listening.  Billy in Jersey, what's up?  Buddy.  Hey.  Um, why are you guys thrashing on Thailand?  I mean, did you hear about the movie The Beach?  Yeah, what about it?  It was fucking great.  Oh, whoa.  Sorry about that.  It was great, was it?  Wait, you're going to defend Thailand because there was a great movie called The Beach about it?  Absolutely.  I mean, look, the chicken on there was absolutely ridiculous. 
[00:13:30]  Not to mention, all you guys said was that, you know, it was for kiddie crushers and, you know.  Yeah, that's why Americans go to Thailand to have sexual relations with underage people.  I mean, I can understand that.  I mean, it's, you know, if I had the opportunity, I would totally take you, but I think you can get it.  See?  Creep.  I'm sorry?  All right, Billy.  Thank you.  You know, I don't even think he's ever been there.  Mike in Jersey, what's up? 
[00:14:00]  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Turn down your radio and talk.  I'm sorry.  It's my show, and I'm working.  Uh, listen.  What's wrong with Thailand?  Going here for a couple of times, dude.  It's okay.  Yeah, you been there?  What's wrong with that?  You guys?  Who's been here?  All right, your phone's staying.  Your phone sucks.  He doesn't think there's anything wrong with going to Thailand.  I'd love to know what they do there.  Well, a lot of people go there to pick up, you know, of-age hookers and all that, but there's also a child thing happening there.  I mean, just read one book about Thailand. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  It is like, it's like Disney World for perverts.  Creep Central.  You get whatever you want in Thailand.  You're not going there for the scenery and check out the nice beaches like that other guy.  Thailand just sounds like a dangerous place, and you wouldn't do something like that unless you were going to do something that you couldn't do here.  Right.  All right, well, that's a developing story, but after what, 10 years?  10 years.  They're saying the case is solved?  And the parents, I was one of the ones who thought the parents did it. 
[00:15:00]  Absolutely.  But it did look bad for them, but it's like, wow, these people really did get kind of dragged through the mud.  The cops in Boulder really screwed up.  They spent more time looking into the parents than looking outside of the situation.  And again, the press, which is just despicable.  As was proven yesterday with this flight from England.  Oh, they're awful.  That came over, was bound for Washington, D.C., wound up having to make an emergency landing in Boston. 
[00:15:30]  Luggage all over the runway, dogs sniffing the luggage.  They got everybody out of the plane that was still on the runway, didn't even take it to a gate.  Because as was reported on all the news channels yesterday, somebody was on the plane with a jar of Vaseline, a screwdriver, matches two notes, one of which was written in Arabic, and both which mentioned Al-Qaeda. 
[00:16:00]  That is where we were left yesterday when we finished our little work day.  Turns out it's a 59-year-old woman with an anxiety attack that had to be restrained, and the flight crew thought it safe to just lay on the plane in Boston.  But the difference between a 59-year-old woman having a panic attack and Al-Qaeda and a screwdriver and Vaseline and all these little things that get you all freaked out is one end of the spectrum to the other. 
[00:16:30]  Another reason why the news just stinks.  They spent hours on this.  Hours.  Scaring the crap out of us.  They love stories like this.  As soon as it came across the news desk, they're like, we're running with this, man.  Yeah.  You know, 24-hour coverage, and this is what you get today.  20 seconds.  An airplane flying from London to Washington had to be diverted Wednesday because of a disturbed passenger. 
[00:17:00]  The plane was cleared and the baggage checked by bomb-sniffing dogs after it made an emergency landing in Boston.  The woman was detained because of suspicious behavior, but officials say she is not a terror threat.  She will, however, face charges for interfering with a flight crew.  That's what I get today.  Excuse me, can you bring up the crap you talked about yesterday?  Bring up the fact that every news agency was reporting Vaseline matches, a screwdriver.  A note from Al-Qaeda.  A note with Al-Qaeda referenced in it. 
[00:17:30]  Where did that garbage come from, and why don't you talk about it like it never happened?  Yeah.  20 seconds you get today.  That's it.  A little more sensationalism, please.  Could you?  Why did they land the plane in Boston if it was going to D.C. anyway from England?  I mean, how much shorter a flight is that once you're in the air?  I know.  Well, apparently the flight crew, it's their discretion, and they decided she was in a bit  too much of a tizzy.  Oh, just punch her in the face.  I know.  Give her a drink.  Get all the bags off.  Oh, the people must have just been miserable. 
[00:18:00]  They had to get off the plane in the middle of the runway.  All their luggage had to be searched.  Because you're already there.  Yeah.  You're literally, I mean, you've got to be ready to come down.  How much, what are you, 20 minutes away in the air?  If she was going to do anything, she would have done it over the water, the big pond.  Well, they probably didn't want to land in D.C. because it's Washington, D.C.  You know, Boston's expendable.  You could blow up Boston.  You know, there'd be a few Sox fans pissed off. 
[00:18:30]  But for the most part, all right, Boston.  Jesus.  I like you.  They're looking at their radios like, what is wrong with you?  What is this idiot saying?  Let's go to Phil in New York.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, when I was in Thailand, I went on a scuba diving trip.  You know how they have, like, the thing to go see all the different shows and stuff in the hotel lobby?  Is that a girl's name?  Scuba?  They name their kids over there.  So you went there to go scuba diving.  In the hotel, they advertise, like, all sorts of entertainment options in the lobby. 
[00:19:00]  But, yeah, you see that in most hotels, sure.  Yeah, well, in Thailand, there's nothing else to do there but scuba dive, buy drugs, and sex.  That's it.  Yeah, and every sex show is better than the next, man.  Yeah, but they use the code word teen when you want young girl.  Oh, is that it?  Poor boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's like the code word that you want really young.  Well, they could have found a better code word that disguises it a little more teen. 
[00:19:30]  No kidding.  Wow, what does he mean?  Well, we have no idea.  Got an awful code word.  Great code word.  There you go.  There's Phil being honest.  That's what it's about over there.  All right, we should take our first break.  We're just getting started.  We got lots to do today.  Lots and lots of stuff to do today.  I can't get enough of Annetta, the mood setter.  Annetta, the mood setter.  She quit on the air?  Yeah, we'll talk about her a little more after the break.  She was angry.  She's a brave DJ in Mobile, Alabama. 
[00:20:00]  She quit and no one even cared.  We did.  Well, we cared enough to goof on how stupid it was and how she did it was ridiculous.  We got the audio.  We can play that one more time today.  Sure.  Also, we got to talk about Club Soda Kenny's appearance last night.  It was terrific.  We'll get into all the details.  Look how tired he is.  I'm exhausted.  He did an appearance for the Opie and Anthony show and he's exhausted.  Homeless radio today and lots of other stuff.

[00:21:30]  Give it a listen.  See what you think.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Andrea, very, very upset on the phone lines here.  Andrea, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  What's going on?  What's up, Andrea?  Okay.  So yesterday, right around rush hour in midtown Manhattan,  my girlfriend and I got into a cab after a couple glasses of wine, 
[00:22:00]  and we see this garbage truck with a wow sticker.  And we'd never seen a wow sticker in Manhattan before.  So we tell the cab driver, hurry up, hurry up.  Catch up to them.  Catch up to them.  And we start taking off our tops.  And I start, like, leaning out the window to wow the guys.  This is right around, like, Park Avenue.  The cab driver sees what we're doing.  He kicks us out of the cab.  And we're both.  We're in Park Avenue, like, around, like, 60 or something. 
[00:22:30]  And we're both, like, half naked, running, like, away in the intersection of Park Avenue.  And what kind of cabbie did you have?  Obviously, you didn't have one of those rare American cabbies.  Nope.  No, he was.  He was.  It smelled like curry.  Pekastani.  Oh, he must have been really.  He was so angry.  Of course.  You women are supposed to be covered up.  Supposed to be covered up from head to toe.  What a party pooper, man.  All you want to do is wow the garbage truck that had the wow sticker and the cabbie wouldn't help you out. 
[00:23:00]  No.  It was awful.  What kind of boobies you guys got?  Oh, we stopped traffic.  Oh, yeah.  You stopped traffic with what you got?  Yeah.  I mean, in a good way.  See, this is just more proof, guys and girls, because some of the girls want to be wowed, too.  This is happening all the time.  You've got to get your wow stickers or your homemade wow signs on the back of your cars.  You have to.  There's girls like this out there that will flash you if they see the wow sticker.  We were so excited.  And you have to understand, we were, like, on the street, like, naked, like, trying to, like, get our clothes back on. 
[00:23:30]  And there's people, so we just tried to act like we had just been making out or something.  Now you're lucky.  Nice clause.  A cab would have driven you back to his neighborhood where they would have stoned you.  Savage.  Well, we just told ourselves that we're Tulsa.  All right.  Well, better luck next time.  But thanks for supporting wow there, Andrea.  Don't let that discourage you.  Yeah, please.  We need more women like you out there to help the wow movement.  Before we move on, Club Soda Kenny in studio. 
[00:24:00]  Very, very tired.  He looks sleepy.  Well, he was out, I'm sure.  An action-packed evening.  Yeah.  I am very Ty-Ty.  He did his first appearance for the Opie and Anthony show.  His first official appearance by himself.  It was very exciting.  Where was the appearance there, Kenny?  The headquarters Gentleman Cabaret at 38th and 11th.  A beautiful place.  Gentleman's Cabaret.  Is it new?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've been there for about a year.  The guy that used to manage scores now opened his own place. 
[00:24:30]  And man, they really know how to treat a fella, too.  Yeah?  They rolled out the red carpet like I was a celebrity.  Wow.  Wow.  You got the food.  You got the funny money.  I heard the street team from the station here in New York showed up.  It was an extravaganza.  A big event.  Extravaganza?  Gravaganza.  You had Opie and Anthony traveling virus tickets for the PNC show.  Yeah.  Big ticket giveaway.  Yep.  Free team giving away T-shirts and all kinds of things.  Yeah.  Sure. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Commercials running for it.  We heard the plugs, the promos running for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come see Club Soda Kenny at headquarters.  Uh-huh.  The club.  Wow.  And I got to tell you, they pounded the hell out of this appearance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  It was incredible.  Exciting times for Club Soda Kenny.  So how many people showed up to the big appearance last night?  I brought two friends with me, Madonna, Mike, and, you know, Pete, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all excited to go to the club and have a big night.  And I'll tell you, the food is terrific.  Oh, no.  The ladies are hot. 
[00:25:30]  Unbelievably smoking hot.  And you know what's bad about those appearances is when you can't meet everybody.  And you feel bad because you got to turn, you know, some people away because you're on  a schedule.  Yeah.  It's like when you guys do an appearance and you have to sign autographs for hours on end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's fighting and shaking hands and taking pictures for hours.  So that must have been something.  He called me from the place.  He goes, I couldn't come by because I had a thing.  But it sounded like it was just about to start.  It was like right what time was it?  It was about 7 o'clock?  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  7 to 9.  Yeah.  Right around there.  And you had Mike, obviously, for the extra security.  Right.  Yeah.  He had a hand, the line got on.  Yeah.  I had my muscle in my mouthpiece there.  Good.  Good.  And that's why we called you because they had all the funny money for the girls, for the lap  dancers and everything.  Oh, so ready to go.  Yeah.  We're all married gentlemen, so we called our little friend, you know, little Jimmy.  So you were looking forward to a knee job?  No.  No.  That was Jimmy's like thing.  Yeah.  They called me to see if I wanted to come, but I had a...  Yeah.  He's the lap dance expert. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Well, so how many O&A listeners showed up to support the call?  Now, give us a round number, a ballpark figure, because we don't expect you to count each and  every one.  That would be silly.  I had a great dinner.  You would love the wine menu there.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Good wine list.  Yeah.  And they have all the martini.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  We can.  What kind of food do you have?  What do you have for dinner?  Oh, they got appetizers, salads.  They got everything.  Finger food, steaks.  Terrific.  Do they?  The waitstaff, terrific.  Hot chicks. 
[00:27:00]  So the street team from 92.3 came.  This is a big event.  Yeah.  Handing out wow stickers.  Everything.  T-shirts.  They had shirts.  3FM all over the joint.  Yeah, sure.  And most importantly, the girls.  Oh, the girls.  Smoking hot.  Yeah.  They got private rooms for like bachelor parties.  Wow.  Yeah.  If you want to have private parties and then private, private things.  If you want to or don't want to have a private party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how many Opie and Anthony listeners showed up?  I tell you, it was a terrific place. 
[00:27:30]  So wait.  How many?  Try none.  Oh!  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Okay.  Terrific.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  It's over, Jenny.  You're just a tool. 
[00:28:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Wait.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Wait.  What?  We're cakes for nothing.  Wait.  Can you say that again?  You're kidding, right?  No, not one single soul appeared to see Club Soda Kenny.  I bring nothing to the table.  You realize, on the way to the airport today, when we're in the truck, you will have, by 
[00:28:30]  100%, increased your audience.  Wow.  Wow.  The only thing you guys missed was the crickets.  Because if the music wasn't playing in the club last night, that's what you would hear.  Dead silence.  Were you just sitting around, like, looking at the door, hoping maybe there's going to be  a big rush of people?  Well, we, like, I got there, like, it was dinner at six.  They rolled out the red carpet, you know.  And then, like, we had the nice dinner, and everybody's excited. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Roberto, the salesman's there.  I'm meeting Al, the manager.  Big Mike, the owner's coming.  Oh, boy.  They're telling me how they're bringing 12 hot chicks to the O&A Village for the PNC virus  show.  Everybody's happy.  Everybody's excited.  They brought in extra girls just to handle the crowd.  Oh, no.  They brought in all Jägermeister shot girls just to, like, appease all the O&A fans.  Yeah, because our listeners love to drink.  Yeah, yeah.  They brought in all this extra.  But, unfortunately, they don't love girls. 
[00:29:30]  And how many showed up?  None.  A goose egg.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  How uncomfortable was the small talk with, like, the salespeople and the management of  the club?  Oh, well, it was funny because poor Roberto, the salesman's, I think he was trying to put  a roadblock outside the Javits Center and, like, detour people into the club.  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello? 
[00:30:00]  And then Pete from the street team is trying to console me going, oh, look, dude, you  know, it's hit or miss.  You know, it's not bad.  It's, you know.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  If you had AIDS blood on the table, three people would have showed up to see that.  It's not bad.  Are you kidding me?  Hey, we got some audio from Tom Chiasano.  He set this whole thing up.  And I hear he paid you a pretty penny to be there, Kenny.  Yeah, I owe him money now.  Oh, boy.  We got some audio from Tom Chiasano. 
[00:30:30]  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so thanks.  That'll be my first and last pay to pay.  I'm sure there'll be many more, Ken.  Yeah, I'm sure you'll get another one soon.  It was just, yeah, a fluke, as they say.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I just want to stick up with Kenny for one reason, you know, one time.  Hey, Mike.  This is the first time that the women outnumbered the men at an O&A appearance. 
[00:31:00]  He brought in extra dancers, not to appease the customers, but to act like them.  Pretend you're there to see him.  They were trying to rip people out of cans.  Oh, it's horrible, the poor guy.  And these poor girls, like, they're trying to talk to, like, me, Mike, and Pete.  We're all married men.  Right.  And they got, like, nothing to do.  Wait, there was no one else in the club?  No, zero.  Zero.  So not even, like, regulars were there?  No, about, like, 8.30, two old guys walked in, and then, like, these 12 girls just converged  on these two guys.  Wow.  Dude, do you understand how much I would like? 
[00:31:30]  That is actually really a great place.  All right, where is it?  38th and 11th.  Here's the beauty of that.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse than walking into a hot strip club, and there's 500 guys and eight  chicks.  If there's, like, six or seven chicks on a regular basis and no guys.  Oh, yeah.  You have to go, because one of them is a type of carry.  Now you get some action.  No, but they were saying they get a late-night crowd, like, 10, 11 o'clock, because, you know,  bars in New York are open to 4 a.m.  Of course, your parents ended at around 9.  9 o'clock, yeah.  So they're trying to make you feel good.  Like, nah, people come out later to these joints. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, no, they do actually very well there, and they spend a lot of money advertising  here.  How many times did they say it's not your fault?  I know, I know.  Everybody was PD positive last night.  Just all looking at the door, waiting for one lousy soul.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the street team was there.  Greeting Kenny.  No.  Here's them greeting Kenny.  Good evening.  I'm trying the wine.  Food.  All right.  Oh, the big dinner.  Yeah.  What a thief you felt like. 
[00:32:30]  You want to lap dance, Kenny?  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  And then everybody got excited when Fan walked in the room.  Oh, Fan was there.  They thought he was a customer, and then they found out he was a producer of the show.  And you could tell how hurt Kenny was, because he couldn't joke enough about how few people  there were there.  Like, it was so obvious that he was really taking it personally, because he kept saying,  Oh, I guess I'm a really big draw, huh? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  It was very sad.  You know what?  I don't feel bad for him.  Welcome to our world.  Now you know what we've been dealing with.  How awful is this stand-up?  You know what it's like is this stand-up?  To go out there and have like 30 people in a room that seats 400?  Yeah.  It's just awful.  So it happens to all of us, Kenny.  You shouldn't have taken it out on the dances, though, Kenny.  We got some audio of Kenny talking to one of the girls.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  Fancy talk.  Poor Kenny.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  You know it.  Hey, Kenny, I need another cup of coffee. 
[00:33:30]  I'm sure Anthony needs some club soda.  Jimmy, what do you need today?  Oatmeal?  Yeah, I'm a little oatmeal and some blueberries.  Yeah, I'll go back to doing what I do best.  There you go.  All right.  Until next time.  But listen, everybody, please.  Headquarters, gentlemen, cabaret, 38th and 11th, hot chicks, bachelor parties, booze.  You're feeling guilty that you took their money, huh?  Yeah.  You might as well just walk in there with a gun and put your hand in the register and walk  out.  Why don't you just do that?  Poor people.  They have a big event set up. 
[00:34:00]  Well, they'll see all the hot chicks at our PNC show.  They're going to be the dancers on the stage and in the village.  I actually wish I would have went now.  Shut that off.  I wish I would have went because I don't know what to say.  Here's management for Kenny.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  Pardon you.  Yeah, well, there you have it.  Speaking of, Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event  of 2006.  It's right around the corner now, folks.  How did something like this happen?  This now broke records for the venue on how many tickets it sold. 
[00:34:30]  That's right.  We're nine days away from the comedy event of 2006, August 26, PNC Bank Art Center in  Jersey.  Also, we're going to be at the Tweeter Center for all you Philly guys and gals September  9th.  September 23rd.  We head to Cleveland, Ohio to the Tower City Amphitheater.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  All the info is up on opiananthony.com.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  So we're going on vacation after tomorrow's show.  So the next time we're going to see a lot of people is on that stage at the PNC. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  It's going to be a great show.  I'm telling you.  A lot of fun.  The reviews on the first show were really, really good.  We got to, before break, play Innetta the Mood Setter one more time.  Innetta the Mood Setter.  I think when we played this yesterday, it was late into our radio day.  I don't think we gave it as much attention as we should have.  This is an interesting little thing.  After six years of being a part-time on-air personality at WBLX in Mobile, Alabama. 
[00:35:30]  Part-time in Mobile.  For six years.  Wow.  For six years.  It's over, Johnny.  You're going nowhere.  Innetta the Mood Setter exits WBLX with a bang.  Everything about this story is bad.  Where she was, how long she was there, what her work was.  Right.  And her name, and the audio of her voice.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Everything is awful.  Yeah.  Look for another career.  Listen to her quit live on the air unexpectedly Saturday afternoon.  But we have a problem with how she quit.  Here's the audio.  It's pretty quick.  The Big Station 93 BLX is the Gulf Coast number one for hip-hop and R&B.  And now it's Ray-Ray and Miranda, the home team, in the morning.  Do it to it.  What better song to do it to it? 
[00:36:30]  It's Inetta the Mood Setter.  And I told you I had a very important announcement.  And here it is.  I refuse.  I refuse to walk around and watch people on my job looking over my shoulder.  People lying to me.  People talking about me.  It's ridiculous.  It is sad.  I can't take it.  I'm not going to take it.  I don't have to take it.  I'm not a dummy.  I know how to find another job.  But I refuse to walk around people. 
[00:37:00]  You can say what you want to say about me.  And if you see me on the street, I'll let you know whatever you want to know.  But I refuse.  For the last six years, I made $6 an hour.  That ain't nothing.  I just got a raise after six years.  I know I'm qualified.  And after saying this, I don't care if I ever get another job in radio, period.  It does not matter to me.  But I never will not be setting the mood at BLX no more. 
[00:37:30]  I refuse to walk around with people that'll speak to you.  Hey, I never.  How you doing?  But then as soon as you walk by that bitch, I will not do it to myself anymore.  So if you're confused about what I'm saying, listen very carefully.  I quit this bitch.  I'm a big station, 93 BLX.  That's where I have the problem.  I quit this bitch.  She makes this dramatic announcement and then goes right into the promo, 
[00:38:00]  which leads into the commercials that feeds the radio station.  And then she's gone.  What a poo-ha!  Why not hang out and take some calls, bash a little more,  give a few details as to why you're leaving?  I would just sit there and home until they drag me out of the studio.  People lying to me.  Like she's trying to be all tough and stuff, but she makes sure she does the right thing  in case management sees it her way and gives her the big raise or the full-time shift. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  So she makes sure she hits that promo and then the commercials follow it.  If you're going to quit and you really mean it, you get up and walk and all you hear is this  like as you're collecting your stuff and cursing the whole way out.  Where's the cursing?  Throw a few of the big bombs out.  No cursing, nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I quit.  Wow.  People after a job looking over her shoulder, talking behind her back, like, welcome to 
[00:39:00]  radio.  Mm-hmm.  Welcome to radio.  You're in the wrong business.  Mm-hmm.  So I don't know why I find that fascinating.  It's just, it's like-  That's good.  Wow.  You quit.  Wow.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  Wow.  But make sure you get the commercials in.  Don't want to piss off management even when you're quitting.  I know.  Isn't that great?  All right.  We got lots to do.  We continue with a cute little story that's in the Daily News today.  Hoo-hoo.  Yeah, we got to read this word for word. 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  It's terrific.  Yeah.  Made the paper.  We talked about it the other day, but it seems to have made the paper.  And it didn't make the post because they're too busy protecting him.  Oh, no.  But the Daily News has no problem talking about Howard Stern.  This is a great story.  Yeah.  This is a great story that has legs.  We'll get into it next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hot rods.  Beer.  Chicks. 
[00:40:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Are you even going to finish this?  No.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That was a lot of fun during the commercial break.  Watching our other boss down there in Washington, D.C. on the pal talk camera.  Yeah.  Chewing someone out on the phone. 
[00:40:30]  And then he had to pick up his hockey stick.  He's got like a stick around his office.  I don't know.  It's his ass kicking stick.  Yeah.  He doesn't look happy now that he's off the phone.  No.  And we notice it looks like there's dried blood on his little chalkboard thing.  I think there's some programmer laying at the bottom of that dead.  Elo pretty much runs XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  And he's also a known pest of the Opie and Anthony Show, which is strange to us.  And he has joined the pal talk nation. 
[00:41:00]  So we get to watch him in his office making big decisions.  Yeah.  We watch him chew out fellow employees.  It's great.  And he's got TVs on in the background.  And I thought it would be funny if while he's chewing someone out or making one of those intense phone calls.  Yeah.  I thought it would be funny if there was like gay porn on in the background and he forgot to turn it off before he turned on his pal talk camera.  Yeah, this is some real hardcore stuff.  Right.  He's actually yelling at his wife telling her to burn the pictures of him and John Carr together. 
[00:41:30]  Get rid of them.  I know they're not incriminating, but they are.  Oh, too much fun.  We traded a couple of emails.  What can I say?  We're all about the new technology.  We always have been.  The pal talk cameras taking over our radio program.  We actually get to watch the listeners listen to us, which is strange because all of a sudden you'll see that maybe one of your jokes did well because they all start laughing.  Laughing or taking their clothes off, one or the other.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Bob Dylan, yes, he does a fine radio show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:42:00]  There you go.  There's your plug there, Elo.  Now get back to work.  There you go.  Hey, I want to plug YouTube.  I can't get enough of YouTube.  Yeah, you got to sort through a lot of garbage, but yeah, I do like it.  But they're figuring it out on a daily basis, and they're organizing that site much, much better.  I just like throwing in our names, Opie and Anthony.  See what pops up.  Well, because videos come from all over the place.  They come from Steve and our own Sam.  But then fans that have some obscure video of us, they throw that up there, and you never know what you're going to get. 
[00:42:30]  The other day, I don't know if you did it, but someone threw a rot gut video up there.  Oh, really?  Like your intro thing that you used to do.  I didn't do it.  I swear.  I wouldn't do that.  Do you think Joe threw it up there?  No, he was probably a fan.  It's Anthony about 12 years ago, dressed as John Travolta, doing the whole John Travolta strut thing.  The beginning of Saturday Night Fever, where he's walking with the paint can down the sidewalk.  Yeah.  He was doing that as an intro to our live show that we used to do. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  We used to play on the big screens at whatever venue we were at, and it would end on stage with the curtain closed.  And that's how the video ends, and then the curtain opens, and I'm dressed in the same regalia, and we go into our live show.  Yeah.  It was great.  I mean, your hair is out of control.  Yeah.  You look like you should be playing for, you know, Boston or something.  We've made that joke many, many times.  Your hair is so out of control. 
[00:43:30]  There's Anthony from, like, 12 years ago.  But out of nowhere, I'm checking out Opie and Anthony.  You throw that into the search engine, and you don't know what's going to pop up.  And I'm watching you last night with this rotgut promo thing.  It used to get some laughs.  So I'd sneeze into my hand.  And then throw it on a wall.  And throwing it on a wall.  And there was a lot that ended up on the wall.  There's you carrying a Budweiser.  Wow.  Well, because he had the case.  And it was all to the Saturday Night Fever music.  Boy, as you carry that case of Budweiser, it really looks like it's filled with beer, by the way. 
[00:44:00]  Well, I think we drank it during production of this.  It's obviously an empty case because it's swinging.  It's swinging way too easily in your hand.  If you remember, Travolta's paint can swung pretty easy, too.  I was, all right, well, you were true to your art there.  That's right.  But, yeah, every night before I go to bed, I check out what's up on YouTube.  Yeah.  Just like I said, Opie and Anthony in the search engine.  They're throwing some of the old school videos from our old show up there.  Like the time I beat up Frenchie. 
[00:44:30]  The time you wrestled with Jay Moore.  Wow, yeah, Fight Club.  Blind Boxing is up there.  Me smashing the vintage Rolling Stones pinball machine is not up there yet.  I'm sure it will be now tonight.  What else?  The shower scene that we did for the Opie and Anthony traveling virus, that's up there and very disturbing.  The new TV commercial made it up there.  The Opie and Anthony TV commercial is up on YouTube.  Yes.  But I'm trying to think of Jimmy wearing the Opie and Anthony shirt on Lucky Louie. 
[00:45:00]  I'm trying to remember what else I watched last night.  I think every single video that's ever been shot is up on YouTube now.  I can't get enough of it.  I'm addicted.  And then I like seeing the other videos that other people are throwing up there.  Like all of a sudden a dumb video will be up there and it gets a million hits.  Did you see the one of the woman that took her picture every day for what, three years or something like that?  No.  It's got over a million hits.  And all it is is a...  And it's her morphing into a...  All it is is her just, yeah, morphing.  Because she took a picture of herself, I guess, every day. 
[00:45:30]  I forgot the time period, like for three years or something.  Jesus.  It has over a million hits.  And he with a black eye.  But check it out.  Annoying.  I've got to take my picture today.  Check out Opie and Anthony videos up on YouTube.  That, you know who you look like in that?  It's really obscure.  You ever see the Star Chamber with Michael Douglas?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  You look like one of the accused child killers that drove the van.  You remember?  The one guy with the beard.  What a creepy look.  I loved Star Chamber. 
[00:46:00]  They should remake that movie.  Or Hal Holbrook.  I loved Star Chamber.  Yes.  All right.  Well, we would do things like this.  It was supposed to, you know, we all had a very outrageous look on stage.  We used to hang ourselves in, like, these things that looked like we were hanging from  the neck.  And we would perform an entire song, the opening song, with the entire band, except for the  drummer, hanging by the neck, like three feet off the stage. 
[00:46:30]  We'd just be swinging.  It looked great.  You know, this curtain would open.  People would just be like, what the hell are these idiots doing?  I'd build things like bazookas and use flash powder and explosives.  A club should have burnt down.  We should have been, like, you know, great white killing, you know, a few hundred people.  Because I'd build these things and then get flash powder, load them up, use batteries  and rocket igniters, and you would see, it would look like I'd pick up a bazooka and  fire it off into the drummer, and the drummer's drum kit would explode. 
[00:47:00]  Like, this is what we did.  And it was, like, all to, you know, a very kind of 90s.  Do you got a video of any of this stuff?  My brother's got it all.  He's got to throw some of that up on YouTube.  Got to get a hold of some of that stuff, because it was just really outrageous stuff.  After vacation, remind me, I'm going to get the Real Rock TV stuff, and I'm going to  throw that up on YouTube.  Oh, that's going back, too.  And up on opianantony.com.  Yes, that's another way you can check out the videos, but I was going to say something.  Oh, yeah, the whole great white thing, that was just a matter of time.  Yeah.  When I was working at BAB and I had to, like, hang out in those rock clubs and act like 
[00:47:30]  I cared about the local bands and this and that, the crap they were doing, and I'm thinking  to myself, it's just a matter of time before there's a major, major disaster.  There were so many close calls, even with us, where we'd set off explosives or flash  pots, and the curtain behind the stage would, all of a sudden, you're still playing.  You look and go, oh, my God, the curtain's on fire.  Hello, somebody get that out.  And, you know, fire extinguisher or something, or you'd kick it, and it would go out.  Yeah.  But plenty of instances. 
[00:48:00]  We'd hook up lights.  We would hook up, like, 35,000 watts of lights, these 1,000-watt park hands, 35 of them over  the stage, and have to hook it up to the electrical box, which would amount to car jumper cables.  And there was so much drain coming off of this thing that sparks used to fly out of it every  so often and start little fires around the stage.  We had a guy that just was there to put the fires out.  Remember the old rock club Sparks?  Yeah.  I think it was on Deer Park Avenue.  Yeah, that place burnt down. 
[00:48:30]  It was called Sparks, and yes, it burnt down.  Cheers.  I think that was a little Jewish lightning, though.  Yeah, I think so.  I think Nirvana wrecked it for everybody, and some of these rock clubs had to save their  ass.  Hair bands booked for a year in advance and decided, this ain't gonna work anymore.  Burn it down.  Let's say hi to Jared.  Jared, what's up?  Jared Reed.  Hello.  Hey.  That Asian lady?  Yeah.  That took...  Crap.  I just fucked that up.  Punching out.  Ah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I must say, though, a lot of people ask what punching out is. 
[00:49:00]  That's how you punch out.  Yeah, he knew it.  The guy knew.  He had a flame out in his engine.  He was going in.  He looked at his instruments, saw there was no hope of saving the craft.  Grabbed between the legs.  Poof!  Pop out.  The joke was that the Asian lady, she could have just taken one picture and no one would  have known the difference because she's Asian.  Yeah.  Instead of taking one picture a day for three years or whatever it was.  Quickly, on the news, got a comment on the groundbreaking ceremonies at Yankee Stadium in New York.  A billion dollar stadium, right? 
[00:49:30]  A billion dollar stadium.  And they officially started building it yesterday?  Yeah, but the groundbreaking ceremony thing has gotten silly.  Silly!  You know what they did?  They get everybody.  I saw George Steinbrenner in there and everything and a few of these people, the financiers that  are there are going to be backing this thing and some government officials and they give  them those shiny, shiny silver shovels and now they pour a big pile of sand out for them.  So all they do is lift a shovel full of sand. 
[00:50:00]  It's not even like in the old days where they actually use their foot with the spade shovel  and got a thing of soil and threw it.  But now they put this like confectioner's sugar sand in front of them and they all just kind  of throw a little bit of sand lest they hurt their backs.  Probably the unions got pissed off.  Yeah.  Hey, you're doing part of the job.  That's our job.  Wait, wait.  It was just a shovel full.  It's turned into a real pussy move.  Uh, and the locals very pissed off about this. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Where is it being done?  In the Bronx?  Yeah.  Right next to the old stadium.  Right next to the old stadium.  But, you know.  And the locals are very pissed off because they're taking a park away or something.  Oh, it'll bring in, you know, jobs and stuff.  Perish the thought.  Yeah, the park's important.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Uh, well, we should get some of that audio because it's pretty funny.  Yankees are the only thing saving from that awful South Bronx from just being a nuclear  testing site.  It is scary up there.  Oh, it's awful.  Every time you go to a Yankee game, I haven't been in a couple seasons, but they- 
[00:51:00]  I went.  They protect Whitey.  Just a few weeks ago.  They protect Whitey nicely.  You park in these, uh, parking lots that have, like, 30-foot fences, and then, uh, the  walk to the stadium is completely fenced in.  Yeah.  You're completely separated from the locals.  I like that.  With cops in every little, uh, parking lot.  I used to, I used to laugh my ass off, uh, checking all that out.  Yeah, it's like the jungle safari at Six Flags.  Right.  You're safe, you know.  Uh, let's go to Will in Michigan.  Will.  Hey, Owen. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, how's it going, buddy?  What's up, Will?  Oh, nothing.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Let's go, Will.  Happy birthday, sir.  Uh, I just want to let Oak know that, uh, your video of Smashing the Stones pinball machine  is on YouTube.  Saw it last night.  And that's all I got.  How do you find it?  Is it under Opie and Anthony, or is it under something else?  No, it's under Opie and Anthony, and, uh, it was like the fifth video down as of yesterday.  It was right above, uh, a couple above your blind boxing.  Oh, wow.  Okay, I'll have to check that out. 
[00:52:00]  You guys got, you guys got thousands of videos on there anyway, so it's not going to be shuffled  around.  It's hard to tell if you watch, I'm watching an Ants Rotgut video, it's hard to tell you  if you didn't know what it was, how would you know where it's from?  Uh, it gives you a little description.  Does it?  No, but it's, it's just on the video itself, I'm saying it's just, it should say opianthony.com.  Yeah, it should.  Yeah, everything should say opianthony.com.  You should get that on all those videos.  But sometimes people put them up that don't even, they find it and think it's a goofy  video.  Yeah.  Or they just say, hey, this is from the Opie and Anthony show and pop it on there. 
[00:52:30]  Like listeners, they don't care about plugging us or know where it's from.  But anything we put up there should absolutely have, uh, where it came from on it.  All right, uh, breaking news.  Imus is talking about us again today.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Jesus, what now?  I listened to the replay yesterday and I'm just like, oh, God.  We love Imus.  Yeah.  Because he could take a joke.  And guess what?  We could take a joke too.  Yeah.  That's why we love Imus.  They're funny guys out there.  They really are.  And one reason we hate Howard. 
[00:53:00]  He can't even take a stupid joke.  A little ribbing.  A little ribbing.  Imus has no problem with this.  Uh, he beats us up, uh, pretty good this morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to the Imus clip.  Does he, I was happy to hear him mention my name yesterday.  That was a little thrill.  Little Jimmy.  He called you Little Jimmy.  Certainly.  He has no idea who I am.  He just read it off a paper.  Hey, yeah.  They know who you are.  They do, but Imus doesn't.  It's just his little hat on.  He said, no, no.  I'm a cowboy.  Anyway, uh, on a steel horse I ride, I'm wanted, um, uh, what's that deal? 
[00:53:30]  Uh, dead or alive?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  Jerk.  Here's the, uh, here's the clip.  Ransom tells me he was, uh, driving up from Albuquerque yesterday to the ranch, right?  Uh-oh.  See, here's the problem.  Like, Imus is in New Mexico, outside Albuquerque, on his, uh, on his ranch there for the kids  and all that.  And, uh, we're on the, I think it's the Buzzard in Albuquerque.  Mm-hmm.  Now he gets to hear us every afternoon, because I think that's when they play the show.  Imus gets to listen.  And his crew.  And Opie and Anthony are on 96.3, my boys, were, whatever, for some unfortunate reason, 
[00:54:00]  making fun of the I-man, claiming I didn't understand this idiotic...  For some unfortunate reason.  Oh, that's classic.  Some unfortunate reason.  Making fun of the I-man, claiming I didn't understand this idiotic bit  they were doing, where they had this, uh, deaf reporter on from, uh, Chicago playing on 
[00:54:30]  that I thought they were PSAs they were doing.  I tried to explain, let me speak slowly, so ONA can understand me.  Yeah, before we have to send Whoopi Goldberg over there to smack you through a round, man.  Yeah, well, did you hear about that, Charles?  No.  They were, they were killing Whoopi Goldberg, much as they kill Stern.  They were killing her.  Yeah.  And then she shows up in a studio. 
[00:55:00]  What happened, Bernie?  They basically sucked their thumbs and curled up in a fetal position.  Oh, man.  I gotta hear that again.  Oh, that's precisely what happened.  Oh!  How do you not love Imus?  Oh, my God.  This is the difference between us and other radio shows.  We have no problem showing you that that's exactly what we did.  Of course it is.  Fairies.  And then she shows up in a studio.  What happened, Bernie?  They basically sucked their thumbs and curled up in a fetal position. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, man.  Turned into a couple little pussies.  Can we help you braid your hair, Whoopi?  Yeah.  She sent these two gump jufuses a box of chocolates, apparently.  Oh, that was a little harsh.  We have no defense on that one.  No, we absolutely don't.  We have no defense.  I think it dresses up and take it. 
[00:56:00]  They're absolutely accurate in their depiction of those circumstances.  But it wasn't personal.  We still think her radio show sucks, and time will prove that.  Yeah.  But we didn't have a personal problem with her like we have with Howard.  Don't know her from Hole in the Wall.  Well, there's more.  Oh, no.  You want to hear more?  I had Bud Collins with me, remember?  Yeah.  Durant's here.  And I know Bud, and they just don't think they're funny, you know? 
[00:56:30]  I mean, he probably doesn't even know who they are, but I know he wouldn't think that  was funny.  He'd be offended, you know?  But it was funny.  That's my point.  I don't want to have to turn on them now.  Don't bring that on.  All you have to do is show up in his studio, and then...  After talking to company, and hiring them.  I mean, what were they, nuts?  Jesus. 
[00:57:00]  Just collect the money and shut up.  Leave me out of this 22 trillion.  That's starting already.  Here it goes.  Don't shoot.  Don't turn into a couple little thumb-sucking pussies.  Why can you hear an echo when he's talking, though?  Because he's all the way in Albuquerque.  Oh, God damn, that's funny.  So there's a slight delay there, I guess, when he does his show.  I say bring it on.  Bring it on.  I say bring it on, father! 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, you and him will have some kind of father-son argument.  I say bring it on.  Bring it on.  It's funny.  If it wasn't so true, it wouldn't hurt as much.  There's more.  Oh, God.  Did you hear that morning when Whoopi showed up?  No.  No.  They didn't exactly cave in.  No, they gave it back to her a little bit.  They were more tickled by the fact that she showed up. 
[00:58:00]  Well, the fact that she even knew who they were, yeah.  I mean, it's just a validation for their existence on the planet.  Hey, there's some truth to that, by the way.  Holy crap, Whoopi Goldberg knows who we are.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a little truth to that.  See, I've just been playing this game a lot longer than us.  Oh, yeah.  He knows what goes on in your head.  And it's just a validation for their existence on the planet.  They didn't kick her ass out of the studio. 
[00:58:30]  As soon as she showed up, they caved in.  You sound like, you know.  Dr. Phil, you're a big pussy yourself.  You sound like you're a big, fat ONA butt girl.  I'm an ONA apologist.  I'm like Joe Lieberman for Bush.  It's 21 till the hour.  Please welcome to the I Miss for the Morning program.  In this ugliness.  Somebody who knows a lot about, well, not ONA.  Do you know who?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Jack Jacobs.  Come on in.  You know who they are?  Do you ever listen to them? 
[00:59:00]  Do you like them?  Occasionally.  Yeah, well, they're funny.  I like to laugh, and they're occasionally funny.  Occasionally.  I'll take that.  Who was that?  Yeah, I don't know who that was.  I'll take that.  It went over, they talked over his name or something.  So that's the latest I miss.  And I say bring it on.  And, you know, I got to agree with Imus about that.  But, Imus, you really didn't understand what the hell we were talking about.  Your description of the deaf woman news reporter doing the stories about only handicapped stories. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Your description of that was completely wrong.  It was awful.  Kind of why we jumped on you.  It was awful.  It's some kind of, I don't know, a blind girl talking about...  Running with arthritis.  Something.  As she teaches kids with Down syndrome how to read.  Let's say hi to Joe and Lyndon Hurst.  Joe, what's up? 
[01:00:00]  What's up, man?  How do you do, Joe?  You guys are so fake, man.  Really?  We're fake?  Yeah, we're fake.  All right.  Please explain.  Do yourself in favor.  When you get a chance, listen to what you guys just said.  I've listened to you guys.  You were just laughing.  So fake.  No, it was actually the last time.  Oh, my God.  We weren't laughing fake.  We actually really enjoyed that.  What?  Laughing fake is more...  I was laughing at the fact that Imus was goofing on us, and it was funny. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, if it was funny, then laugh.  Joe.  Joe, why are you talking so quiet?  Just go away, Joe.  All right.  So that's...  Joe was a douchebag.  He certainly was.  If I could just put that in there and get that out of the way.  We're just kind of having some fun with Imus.  He's a buzzkill.  So, all right.  Just take the money and shut up. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Stop with the fake having fun.  Yeah, I know.  He's been taking the money for many, many years.  Huddle, huddle.  Yeah, he knows the way to play.  Boy, he knows that whole corporate thing, too.  He was very, very cool to us when we weren't working.  Yeah.  He was very concerned for us.  That's the fact.  Because that guy, Joe, in the text there, it said, why are you kissing up to Imus?  Because we kissed up to him.  The guy's been genuine. 
[01:01:30]  He's not a phony radio guy.  He's very honest.  He's funny.  And he was supportive of us when we were down in the dumps.  He didn't think we should have went to satellite radio.  He was calling me all the time.  He's like, why don't you just let Fareed hire you and let him throw you into some small markets and then go from there.  And we just didn't want to do that.  No.  But he did say, you guys belong on New York radio and you need to get back on in New York radio.  He was a huge supporter. 
[01:02:00]  We decided to do both.  That's right.  That's what we do now.  And he's funny.  That's why I like him.  Yeah.  Me and my dad used to listen to him.  Stupid Joe.  All right.  Let's take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Lots going on today. 
[01:02:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We got a quick call from Tom on Long Island here.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right, Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Jimmy, love Lucky Louie.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, just calling about, you know, the people that call you up and bash you.  Yeah.  You know, you guys should have like a button or something that like blows their head up whenever they call.  Well, you're asking us why do you take calls from haters, right?  Yeah.  I think because it's different than other radio shows. 
[01:03:00]  We're trying to be different.  And it's honest.  Yeah, and we try to be as honest as possible.  And I think people enjoy that confrontation.  There's a lot of guys out there in radio.  They can't take that.  So they dump out or they hang up on them right away.  We let the haters talk and see what they're all about.  No, no.  I appreciate that.  But let them babble.  They usually hang themselves.  Huh?  You awake, Tom?  You're a little sleepy.  Tom? 
[01:03:30]  All right.  He's gone.  All right.  We want to just get a little taste of homeless radio.  We also want to get into Miss Teen USA.  Miss Teen USA.  I had it DVR'd and finally caught it last night.  Of course you had it DVR'd.  Fantastic.  You had some good observation in the office about it, though.  Oh, please.  You want to talk to Damien, too, from MTV.  He was one of the co-hosts.  I thought it was supposed to be on before the pageant. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, something happened, though.  Yeah, something happened, all right.  After seeing the pageant, I realized they probably said,  maybe the O&A show isn't quite what you should be going on before you do this.  Yeah.  So the Trumpster puts that one on.  The Donald.  Hold on a minute.  I think we have a problem with a CD player here.  Yeah, this isn't reading this.  All right.  So let's do Miss Teen USA instead, then.  We had some homeless radio for everybody.  We've been teasing that for days.  Oops.  But the CD is a little corrupt or something.  Big seat. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know what's going on.  All right.  So talk about Miss Teen USA.  Miss Teen USA.  It's a beauty pageant, and it's open to teen girls between the ages of 15 and 19.  And Donald Trump puts it on, you know, and it's pretty much about getting them in bikinis  and revealing clothing.  Yeah.  It really is hot.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[01:05:00]  They were showing the girls, and they never – beauty pageant girls never look their age.  For some reason, they always look like they're somewhere between like 25 and 35, Miss America,  things like that.  But this teen pageant, they looked like they were about in their mid-20s.  And then they'd show them in their bathing suits and stuff.  They'd be in little bikinis strutting around on stage.  And then they showed their stats.  And you see, oh, this girl, she's 15 years old.  Just a huge set on her. 
[01:05:30]  Legs go on forever.  Like 5'9", 5'10".  And you're thinking, you know, my God, there isn't a heterosexual man on this planet that  wouldn't at least entertain the thought of going to bed with her.  Yeah.  And that's the only reason this is on TV.  Yeah.  Why other reason would this be on TV?  There is no reason for this to be on television except to titillate.  Because they put them in little, you know, bikinis and then the evening gowns and things 
[01:06:00]  like that just to kind of make them look all hot.  What you were saying in the back office, you know, these contestants are walking out there  hot as ass.  Yep.  Bodies like they're of age.  Yeah.  Look in the part.  And then you said they talk.  And then it's a whole different situation.  That's when you go, oh, oh, I see.  This is why you don't take them home.  Because they talk.  Uh, yeah, there's nothing worse than the mouth of a 17-year-old opening and having 
[01:06:30]  her talk.  Well, we got the host interviewing Georgia.  Miss Georgia.  Miss Teen Georgia, I guess.  Teen Georgia.  This was the, uh, yeah, they had all the beauty portion of the show.  And then they went on to, um, having them talk about something that interested them.  Uh, and then they asked them a question, kind of a surprise thing.  The judges would ask them this random question, which really put the pressure on them.  And boy, do these girls just know how to answer questions in a pinch. 
[01:07:00]  Now, remember, these girls, as you look at them, you think they're of age and they're  Absolutely.  They're just off the charts hot.  They look like they're in their, um, early to mid-twenties.  They look like college girls.  Yeah, but really, like, really in good shape early to mid-twenties.  Georgia, how are you?  I'm great.  How are you?  Good.  Uh, you went on a caving trip?  Yeah.  Tell us about that.  Caving?  Um, actually, I went on a caving trip with a group of my friends.  And if you're claustrophobic, do not go in this cave.  Um, we actually had to army crawl our way through the entire cave. 
[01:07:30]  And there was mud and we were slipping and sliding everywhere, but it was a great, great  experience and it was a lot of fun.  Very nice.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  Do you imagine having to sit through that drivel?  And she's, she's like hot, really hot.  So imagine like, put yourself back there in high school when you hook up with a hot chick,  maybe at a party or something.  That's what this reminded me of.  You're just looking going, oh my God, I want to have sex with you. 
[01:08:00]  Oh my God, I want to have sex with you.  Oh my God, I want to have sex with you.  And, and that drivel is coming out of my, oh my God, we went out of this cave trip and  there was like mud and me and my friends, like, I couldn't believe how, uh, it was like  so much fun.  And we, and now you get looking at her going, oh, shut up.  And now you get to picture them, uh, crawling through mud.  Yeah.  Crawling through mud.  With all their hotness.  By the way, I'm distracted.  The instant feedback going crazy.  We're going to get to the Howard Stern story in a second, but, uh, we got something to add  to it.  So just relax and let us produce our radio show.  Calm down. 
[01:08:30]  We're not teasing it so we can do it on XM.  Stop.  There's a reason we're waiting a few minutes here.  Just relax.  Here's another, uh, clip from Miss Teen USA.  Yeah.  Uh, they talk, uh, to Miss North Carolina.  She talks about memorable jobs.  Memorable job.  I'm here from North Carolina.  Hello.  Hello.  Do you understand that you have had quite a few interesting jobs over the years?  So what have been some of the most memorable ones? 
[01:09:00]  The most memorable was definitely when I was Cinderella for a little girl's birthday party.  It's kind of interesting because the wig was actually a sleeping beauty wig, but the  little girl didn't care.  I had on glass slippers and so did she.  And it was by far the best experience of my life.  She was so excited.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.  Excellent.  And no one knows when, like, Damien is standing there.  He doesn't know when they're done with their story.  The audience doesn't know because it's just this rambling babble. 
[01:09:30]  That's the best moment of your life?  That's it.  It's like wearing slippers with a kid?  Oh, and I dressed up for a kid's birthday party.  Like, it was so cool and she had so much fun and she was wearing glass slippers and so  was I.  And I, oh, this, this is why, like, ether was invented.  So you could just dump it into a rag and shove it over her face and quiet her down.  What's the difference between a sleeping beauty wig and a snow wig? 
[01:10:00]  What was the other chick?  Did she poo Cinderella?  Does it matter?  Does it matter?  I can see if she said I was playing Cinderella, but all the hell was a JFK wig.  So I put half of it on and the other half was on the back of the car and it spoiled the  party.  Oh, it was so cute.  The little kid had, like, a pillbox hat on.  She was grabbing brains.  All right.  You want to go on with this or what?  Oh, give me a couple more.  Or do you want more I miss abuse?  Which leads to this.  Oh, boy.  That's what we were waiting for, you asses on instant feedback. 
[01:10:30]  Don't you wish Damien would have just jumped in when she said the sleeping beauty and the  thing and he would have said there's no difference, whore.  Yeah, what's the difference?  All right, we'll try another one here.  Yeah, we'll at least do one more.  Maybe we'll do a few more later on.  And welcome back.  Okay, there are many stressful situations for teens.  We all know that.  But nothing can beat answering a final question live on national television.  Oh, no.  But remember, ladies, there are no right or wrong answers.  Yes, there is.  This is to be yourself, and hopefully you will win over the judges.  Yep, this is the round that determines everything other than that. 
[01:11:00]  No pressure.  No pressure at all.  This year, our panel of judges selected their own questions.  So now we will ask each of our finalists to pick the name of a judge who will then get  to ask a final question.  All right.  You'll only have 30 seconds before you hear this bell.  All right, good luck.  We begin with North Dakota.  None of them heard the bell, by the way.  North Dakota, please pick the name of a judge.  Oh, just pick one. 
[01:11:30]  Judge number nine, Hayden Penetier.  Who?  Hello.  Hi.  How are you?  Hey, nice job.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Good answer.  Do you think today's teens are obsessed with their weight and their image?  I definitely do.  Girls especially.  Not so much guys.  Girls have a problem with it.  And I think if you're comfortable in your own skin, go for it.  And you'll look great no matter what you do.  Just feel comfortable. 
[01:12:00]  Thank you very much, North Dakota.  That's it.  Light.  And the image that they're portraying is emaciated.  All these girls were so ultra skinny and asking her about teens' weight.  And like guys don't have weight problems, these girls just babbled incessantly.  Babbled.  But they were so hot.  So hot.  You watched every minute.  Oh, couldn't get enough. 
[01:12:30]  They asked Miss Teen Georgia, what is one big contribution teens are making today?  Do the driver's license one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do that one.  It's Miss North Carolina.  Yeah, this is brilliant.  Miss Teen North Carolina.  Next, Montana.  Hello.  Hello.  Please speak the name of the judge.  Dramatic.  Thank you. 
[01:13:00]  Judge number eight, Carl Lewis.  Hello, Miss Montana.  Hello, Mr. Lewis.  Hi.  My question is, what does integrity mean to you?  These clips are all screwed up.  Integrity means to me someone who is driven.  When you have integrity, you're driven.  And you will do all that you can.  She has no idea what integrity is, by the way.  And you don't let anything stop you to get to the goal that you're trying to achieve.  No.  It's integrity.  Not really.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, these were flipped, so it doesn't matter. 
[01:13:30]  No.  I didn't notice, actually.  Yeah, I know.  See?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Look at my breasts.  It should say dummy clip number one.  Dummy clip number two.  That's all right.  Whatever.  That's fine.  All right.  What was...  Get to Imus.  All right.  Back to Imus, and then we'll move on from Imus for today.  Yeah.  I love Imus.  Sounds like, just like us, he didn't prepare for a show today.  Just trade barbs back and forth? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, you got to fill up five hours a day.  Imus is like, well, I could kill an hour talking about Opie and Anthony today.  What's this about Stern, by the way, you told me?  Oh, apparently a lot of the listeners are upset because Gary Delabody's father died,  and Stern didn't go...  Oh, sorry.  That's a terrible thing.  Stern didn't go to the funeral.  And he's getting a lot of grief, no pun intended, for him.  Why didn't he go to the funeral?  According to Rush and Malloy, his girlfriend hurt her ankle at a polo match in the Hamptons, 
[01:14:30]  and then he couldn't make it, you know?  I guess, you know, he had to put ice on it or something.  Oh, sure.  And he'll screw Baba Booey and his dad, his dead dad.  She hurt her ankle at a polo match?  Shouldn't they shoot her now?  Well, here's what Opie and Anthony should do, is get on that and leave me alone. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Show some onions.  Yeah.  That's your real competition there.  Yeah.  That's who you have to kick.  If you can't kick Whoopi Goldberg's ass...  Yeah, I mean, that was...  He's begging you.  This is unbelievable.  Why'd you think it was in Rush and Malloy?  I don't know if it's your challenge.  Because we talked about it.  We were the first show to talk about it.  That's why we mentioned it a couple of days ago, right after it happened. 
[01:15:30]  Well, here's the story from the Daily News.  King of all media, royally disloyal.  Even Howard Stern's loyal fans are unhappy with him after he skipped the funeral of long-time  producer, Gary Delabate's father, over the weekend.  Yep.  Boy, Gary's been his producer for years, has made that show great in its heyday.  He's probably sacrificed his life for Howard.  Yeah.  Literally sacrificed his life for Howard.  His father dies.  That's a horrible thing to happen to anybody. 
[01:16:00]  Yep.  I know personally.  Certainly.  Anthony knows.  And this douche doesn't even show up at the funeral.  No.  Doesn't even show up at the wake.  Not even the wake.  I guess he paid for like a dinner or something for some of the people.  Trying to justify the fact that he didn't show up.  And the reality is he wants to be in the Hamptons.  He doesn't want to do radio anymore.  He's there with his chick who he thinks is hot, but I think she looks more horse-like  than she is hot.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  And they're at some kind of Hamptons polo match.  Now they're trying to say she broke her ankle because Howard is looking bad.  Stupid Howard.  Howard, I'm glad this crap is finally coming out.  He doesn't give a crap about anyone except for himself.  And the listeners are starting to catch on finally.  How do you blow off your producer's father's freaking wake and funeral?  People were saying that he was on the air and he mentioned something about her having some 
[01:17:00]  kind of hairline fracture and it didn't need a cast.  She was in one of those booties, one of those little boots that they put on and a crutch.  But, you know, still parading around out in the Hamptons.  And people are, you know, speculating.  People are speculating.  Yeah.  That he was out there in the Hamptons.  It's the tail end of his vacation.  Another one.  And he just didn't want to drive out to Uniondale, make the drive, because he was down in the Hamptons. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, there's a lot.  Polo matches and, you know, sit around and sip cocktails.  Champagne cocktails.  High in the Sierra Mountains.  Where's Uniondale?  Is that in Long Island?  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's not even that far.  It's not that bad.  You can go and, you know, show your respect and be back in the Hamptons in time for freaking happy hour.  Yeah.  You loser.  And the guy decides, yeah, not important enough.  Guy only gave me 20 years of his life.  And believe me, Gary does more for that show than a lot of people know. 
[01:18:00]  And the guy was there for 20 years just humping and not making all that much because he still had to go out and do bar gigs.  Yeah, he admitted that to us years ago.  Years ago, he admitted that to us that he had to do bar gigs to supplement his income because Howard wasn't even paying him that well.  No.  And it's not like Howard had, like, a week's vacation and was in the Hamptons.  I can't even see that, to be honest with you.  But he's taken pretty much the whole month of August off.  The whole summer has been vacation lately.  You can't kill a half a day to show your respect. 
[01:18:30]  Yep.  So the Daily News continues.  14,000 Sternheads have expressed their distaste on the website SternFanNetwork.com.  And one former Stern personality stepping out mags, Chauncey Hayden, who's a douchebag too, has gone so far as to declare the radio star a-hole of the week.  Ooh, wow!  Wow!  Chauncey will be found to be a fraud as well. 
[01:19:00]  Stern's excuse for missing the memorial was that his live-in girlfriend, Beth, broke her ankle while attending a recent Hamptons polo match.  My word, lovey.  You've broken your ankle.  It's not clear how this stopped his own legs.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  To make matters worse, many of Stern's diehard fans are promising to cancel their satellite radio subscriptions because of the king of all media's lack of sympathy.  You know?  And going through this thing, the wake is usually a day, maybe two days, and the funeral's different. 
[01:19:30]  So you have plenty of opportunities to show up and show your respect.  It's not a one-day thing for like three hours.  You have some choices there, and he chose not to show up.  Lots of advance notice, lots of choices on time, and she didn't have an injury that he had to be bedside with her for days on end.  She hurt her ankle.  She twisted it, if at all.  But that's about it, and he uses that as an excuse. 
[01:20:00]  And then they brought it up on the air, and apparently he paid for some after-the-funeral buffet.  Like he footed part of the bill for some after-funeral buffet thing that was going on, and that's supposed to make up for it.  I'm so glad his true colors are being shown.  Because we've known for many, many years, and people are like, well, yeah, well, shut up.  He cares about his fans.  He doesn't care about anybody. 
[01:20:30]  He doesn't even care about his freaking girlfriend.  He used that as an excuse so he could stay on the Hamptons.  He doesn't care about her either.  He probably made her stay in the hospital by herself in the ER.  Heather, what's up?  Hi.  No, I was just, my boyfriend was telling me he was listening to the show that day,  and Howard was getting pissed because he said he deserved credit for saying he was going to go.  So he was fighting with everybody in the studio saying he should get credit for saying he was going to go.  For saying he was going to go?  For just saying he was going to go.  Yeah, that's it. 
[01:21:00]  There you go.  It's not his fault.  There's your hero.  A true human being.  It's not his fault.  Thank you, Heather.  And, Opie, thank you for saying she looks like a whore.  She's the only one that will ever say it.  I love you.  Thank you.  Wait, what happened?  For saying she looks like a whore.  Everybody else says she's hot.  She looks like a whore.  Thank you for saying it.  She's got some horse looks to her.  Yeah, I think she looks like a whore.  Thank you for saying it.  Is she butt ugly?  No, but she's not as hot as Howard and everyone thinks she is.  Thank you, Heather.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  So that's the latest on Howard, and, you know, it's in the Daily News today.  It's a big deal here in New York, so go screw.  Loser.  Man, that is just.  Loser.  I don't know how he can look him in the face every day going in there.  Both of them.  How Howard could look at Gary and how Gary could look at Howard.  Because he cut all their balls off years ago.  Mm-hmm.  They have no choice.  They've got to take it.  They have to take it.  They have to sit there and just take it. 
[01:22:00]  Pew.  All right.  And finally, Imus ended with this.  Anyway, 25 out of the hour.  Time for a little sports going on.  20, my friend.  Baseball last night.  The Red Sox.  Hey, by the way, they've got to get a different picture.  I mean, nope, he's okay.  He's kind of cute.  But Anthony is, I mean, he looks like the shoe on her.  They must have a better photograph, don't they?  Well, he's a fairly, he's not exactly, he's got a face for radio.  Face for radio?  He just stepped off a flight from Bangkok, Thailand. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Well, he absolutely does.  I mean, what was he when JonBenet Ramsey went down?  I did not kill JonBenet Ramsey.  Not so fast here.  That would have been Norton, I think.  Right?  Anyway, here's, weren't you doing sports, Chris?  I was.  Red Sox picked it.  Jesus.  Do a radio show, Imus.  They tied us into the Ramsey incident.  I know.  I'm very proud of that.  And believe me, the guy, nothing against Opie being, you know, as far as Imus says, cute or anything. 
[01:23:00]  But you look more like the guy that killed JonBenet than I do.  Oh, stop.  Yeah, I'm saying more like.  I could have been a model.  Everyone knows it.  Saying more like.  Opie's more the face of the guy.  He's a white guy with light hair.  Opie's more the face, but you have more of the light Fiona Apple-ish waif body that that gentleman has.  You're slender.  And if you superimpose that gentleman's head on your body, that's exactly what he looks like.  Yeah.  The old John Carr. 
[01:23:30]  Well, come on, Imus.  Slender.  Well, that was from 15 minutes ago.  He just talked about us again.  Oh, boy.  But he really didn't prepare.  He started trouble by banging him in the chest, and he ran up and punched the white guy in the stands.  A little white guy.  He tried to cover himself up.  But I would always encourage you to protect yourself, but in certain situations, if you can avoid them, avoid them.  That's the way to deliver the message.  He's like an Opie and Anthony-type pussy, this guy.  Yeah.  How about going up and punching Ben Wallace in the face?  Well, Dr. Phil tells me, though, that O&A didn't completely fold up. 
[01:24:00]  Is this a situation where you're going to start attacking you and Louis, start attacking somebody who I like, like you do Jon Stewart?  You're not going to start talking to him.  Isn't that what you wanted us to do?  You called them pussies.  You called them a couple of thumb-sucking pussies yourself.  You just said go with my shirt.  Well, that was unfortunate.  Well, that was earlier this morning when I was cranky.  They're my boys.  You don't have time.  Just like Stewart is.  You had time to reflect.  The difference between Opie and Anthony and Jon Stewart is that Opie and Anthony are actually funny. 
[01:24:30]  You're such a creep.  All right.  Now, stop.  We got our own show to do today.  We can't just put time as a show.  That's pretty cool, though, man.  Thanks.  Boys better be good or I'll do what we did years ago.  Send some anthrax blankets over to them like we did to the Indians.  General Custer's scout. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Did you know that's how he started his career?  What?  The scout for General Custer.  I think he might be General Custer.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Yeah.  That guy is just a...  Isn't he an urbanite?  That would be years ago.  I remember him being a cowboy.  He walks around Manhattan with the cowboy hat.  Yeah.  A bad look.  Well, in Albuquerque, I got to wear the cowboy hat because I'm a cowboy. 
[01:25:30]  Do I have to go through a 10-minute guitar riff?  Every day.  Seems they're wasting away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerk. 
[01:26:00]  I like the chorus.  It's all about me.  Uh, I'm a cowboy  On a, uh, a steel deal  I, uh, ride  I'm, uh, wanted  Um, what's, uh, dead or alive  Or something this morning  I was cranky  Ha, wanted  Dead or alive  Dead or alive  Or something  Yeah, he's a cowboy 
[01:26:30]  All right  He's sitting there with his, um, horse blankets behind him  Old West scenario  The guy definitely, uh, wants to, um, be in that lifestyle  I don't know  I get it  It's 2006  And it's like 1850 where he is  Well, it makes sense when he's broadcasting from the ranch in New Mexico  Does it?  Yeah  Does being in New Mexico mean you have to live like it's 1850?  I'll, I'll say this 
[01:27:00]  I like the cowboy hat look  And the fact that he went in that direction  Instead of with the hip-hop  Which is just taking over everything  And he went  Well, thank God  Against hip-hop  It's Don Imus in the hizzy  He went straight for the old cowboy  He went the other way  Man, people are just asses  Are they?  They really are  Gee, Opie, a couple of months ago  You wanted to punch Gary in the face at K-Rock  Now you're all in Gary's corner  People just don't listen 
[01:27:30]  We're not going to be hanging out with boy Gary anytime soon  But what Howard did to boy Gary is ridiculous  Yeah  Even if you don't like somebody  You can point out how they were wronged by someone else  Doesn't mean you're, uh  Not even going to explain  Kissing their ass or nothing  I want to meet on this  Crap  I want to sit with him  He'll never  He's much too important  He certainly  He'll get the likes of you  He'd have to be introduced 
[01:28:00]  And then he wouldn't recognize my face  Then go Norton  Uh, who?  From the Opie  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah, yeah  Give me a hug, maybe  No hugs  Please  I gotta go  We're gonna take a break  We got Bob Saget calling in  We got Bob Kelly calling in  We got Fatboy Slim stopping by  All on the way  It's the ONA virus spreading across America  This local tavern appears to be quite festive  It's a friendly bunch in here  Seems to be mustache night  Perhaps I'll billy up to the old bar 
[01:28:30]  And request a libation  Ramon  Fetch me a bikini-tini  And then push in my stool  Hear what everyone else is talking about  ONA Uncut and Live  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe  The Opie and Anthony Show  It's the Opie and Anthony Show

Hey there, Bob  Yo, yo, how are you guys doing?  I hear you're doing the radio tour today  Yeah, but I just got off of TV  And on some Channel 7 thing in Chicago  And it was cool to have the Rockettes  So I did a couple of them  Had a couple of extra minutes  As soon as I see someone doing a high kick  I get out my pap smear kit  You're playing the improv in Chicago? 
[01:29:30]  I am  This new club  I had to cancel last week  Because I did that show  I was telling you guys about  That thing  That NBC show  Called One Versus 100  Which could be funny  Because they're letting me ad-lib  Oh, wait, they already  There's no script  I shot it last weekend  So I did five of them  Oh, okay  Are you calling from a gym?  I'm calling from inside my own uterus  I'll go where the echo is less  Is that better? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, there you go  Yeah, now we can feel a little more comfortable  Where's the improv?  It's in a place called Schramberg  Which is, I think, outside of Portugal  I've never heard of it  I mean, I knew there was an improv  But I didn't know there was one in Chicago  Yeah, you never heard of it  Oh, really?  It's nice  It's actually nice  It's an hour  It's brand new  It's like the most beautiful improv I ever saw  It's like 400 to 500 seats  Wow  And it's gorgeous  So that's why I agreed to do it  I agreed to open it  And then I kept rescheduling  And then I moved things around  Because I'm doing your dates, too  So I'm at the improv this weekend

[01:50:00]  And it's like  I like to be wearing them though  It's like a publicity thing  And Jimmy thinks  He's running a department store  I was like  Why are they handing me jeans  Could you look in the back  And see if you got something  That fits me a little better  But I'm like  What a great move that is  Just to hand clothing to people  They're definitely going to plug your stuff  But yeah  These are actually  Like a little signed label  On the back  Which I think Travis  Is going to get all our jeans  Travis  This would fit Travis perfectly  Look come on in here Travis  You get  I'm not even going to  Attempt to fit into mine  Unfortunately  What size are yours  It could have been worse  The single could have been  That old song 
[01:50:30]  I can't wear that  Oh Travis would fit in that  Like  No problem  Travis throw them on  You just got three pairs  Make sure they fit you  Three pairs of jeans  Curse the Fatboy Slim  Do you have a belt for them too  Because I think  Don't worry it's radio  No no no  Oh yes  Save the label though  It's signed you silly goose  Don't toss it out  Alright Travis  Very excited  Really fast  I just want to see  What's going on with Bob Kelly  Bob  Is he on  What are they doing 
[01:51:00]  I don't know  It sounds like he's killing  One of our guys  Is doing TV in Boston  Right  Because Fatboy Slim  Is all confused there  But we'll get the audio  We'll play it a little later  This morning  Yeah we just  We have him  Just trying to say  Some awful stuff  On live TV  But we don't know  If he did or didn't  Yeah  It was hard to tell  Some awful  Thanks for bringing me  Up to speed  I know 
[01:51:30]  Well there's a lot  Going on this morning  Bob Kelly's playing  The Comic Connections  All over Boston  This weekend  So  Show moves a little fast  You produced  For some really  How did you wind up  With Madonna  And U2  I mean you can't get  Better on your resume  Than producing for those two  I haven't produced  Either of them  Good one Jim  Wait wait  No no no  Wait wait wait  It says  It doesn't matter  It's on the paper  No there's actually  Actually there's a good  Madonna story  No no it said that  There's a  I was going to  Remake the dog  But I didn't produce her  And  Why did it say that 
[01:52:00]  Hold on  It said that in here  But apart from that  Good question  I'm sorry Mr. Slim  It said that in here  Jimmy why don't you  Just ask him about  Sabbath  Do you know anybody  In Black Sabbath  No  Damn it  This is going well  No no no  But I actually read that  And I was like  Okay but where did it say  He produced  It did say that somewhere  No  Maybe  No Madonna and U2  Asked him to produce  Oh alright  Okay that's why  Where did it say that  But I remember  I remember when Praise You  Came out 
[01:52:30]  Fatboy's like  What the hell  No that wasn't me either  Yeah  Praise You was winning  All these awards  I think it was at the VMA's  Or something  And it won an award  For choreography I think  Yes  Rightly so I thought  Huh  Rightly so I thought  Absolutely  Fantastic choreography  And they panned the audience  As they're giving out the award  And Madonna is rolling her eyes  She didn't get it  She didn't get Fatboy Slim  That's why it's really interesting  That she asked you to produce  It had to be years later  After that  Because the video for Praise You 
[01:53:00]  It was a dance troupe  That just  Unconventional obviously  They just went out on the street  And you're like  What the hell are these people doing  And it won the award that year  Madonna's rolling her eyes  Because she's all about choreography  And all that  I think it was  Will Smith and Madonna  That they flicked to  And they were just going like  What the hell is this  It's rubbish  And then they flicked to  Bust the Rhymes  And he was like  Yeah  That's what I'm talking about  I thought it was a  It was a great moment in TV  Yeah how did they not get it  Because she was rolling her eyes  Like oh this crap's winning 
[01:53:30]  Yeah especially in England  Where I think I was the only  Kind of English artist  Who did well  And they had all these pictures  In the papers going  Madonna didn't like it  Will Smith didn't like it  The Americans didn't like it  But he still won  Well doesn't that make you happy  That she wouldn't like  Something like that  Yeah  I do like sort of  Confusing people  And doing things the wrong way  There's no big sort of  Political gender  Of upsetting people  But I do like  Sort of making people go  What  Yeah what the hell  Is he doing  You just gave me a pair of jeans  Yeah see  I have to  It definitely raised your eyebrows 
[01:54:00]  When we brought  Brought the jeans in  I gotta defend myself  Because I feel like a total douche  Another question about  Him being a war hero  What do you got  Careful now  Careful now  You've got two strikes  One more  Yeah one more  Wait  After Cook's remix  Of Corner Shop's  Brimful of Ash  Top of the charts  Such musical heavy hitters  As Madonna and U2  Asked him to produce for them  And then it goes on  Fatboy Slim's next work  Was the single  So it really in the bio  Makes it seem like this  So I'm not the horse's ass  It's whoever wrote this  I just appeared really dumb 
[01:54:30]  By reading it  Alright  You've really got yourself  Out of that one  Really well  Yeah  So you read it wrong  Alright  I'm just  Now I gather you were  A lot bigger in England  Before  Here in the States  Because it seems like  You just kind of  Came out of nowhere  One year  Yeah well no  I've been  I've been doing this  For 24 years  And had a few bands  How Spartans  Beats International Freak Power  Which were really big  In Europe  But I'd never done anything 
[01:55:00]  In America  Until Fatboy Slim  It's kind of funny  Because when I first came over  They were like  Hey this new kid on the block  Fatboy Slim  In England I was like  This sort of  You know  The venerable old uncle  Who'd been around for ages  But all of a sudden  I was this thrusting new force  That must be odd though  You know  Because you're kind of  If you're famous for  A few years in England  And you're used to  That whole thing  And the up and coming  Of the whole thing  And how people react to you  And then you come to the States  You've got to do it  All over again 
[01:55:30]  Yeah yeah  I just love being called  A hot new artist  Yeah  That is pretty cool  Hot new artist  Yeah just being called  Hot and new  I went to a couple  Fatboy Slim shows  Yeah  I didn't get it at first  I'm not going to lie to you  You know  When I first started  Hearing about Fatboy Slim  I'm like what  He just spins tunes  And people show up  And they take E  And what  What's going on  Take E  And have fun  And dance and laugh  And they're buttery beats  You like the buttery beats  What the hell is a buttery beat 
[01:56:00]  He plays some buttery beats  So  What are buttery beats  There's a game out called  Luminous  For the PSP  And they got some trippy sounds  They have some trippy sounds  PSP is the handheld  Video game thing  Oh I don't do that  And there's this game  It's Luminous  It's kind of like Tetris  A little more involved  But the music is very trippy  And stuff  And they describe the music  On the back of the box  As buttery beats  And lush looks 
[01:56:30]  Whatever that means  Right  It's like a smooth beat  Of some sort  Yeah very just  You know  Can you spread it  Straight out of the fridge  Huh  Can you spread it  Straight out of the fridge  But then  Low cholesterol  Yeah yeah  What's the cholesterol concern  So we go to the  Fatboy Slim show  And other guys  Were warming up  And doing their thing  On the turntables  And then you show up  And the place  Just goes nuts  Because he's an  Up and coming  Young artist  That's my job  This was only like  A few years ago  I believe  When I first came here  Everyone used to say 
[01:57:00]  Oh are you in Fatboy Slim  In Fatboy Slim  Yeah  Like Jethro Tull  Yeah  I was like  Yeah  Well I'd like to be  Yeah  At first everyone thought  It was going to be a band  And yeah  The show I do  Is just DJing  But we kind of  Take it to  It's not just DJing  It's not just  Well it's DJing  And showing off  Yeah  But it works  You really show off  And you do a great job  And then  Then these people  Were walking around  I think it was a school night  So I'm not drinking  Or doing anything  I'm like the only  Sober person there  And they got like 
[01:57:30]  Balloon animals  On their heads  And they're just  Tripping their asses off  The whole scene  We'll never understand  Like the balloon animals  That are like  Three four feet  High off their heads  That was the thing  For this show  For some reason  I was trying to  Figure it out  Well the thing is  The whole world  Of breakfast radio  Is as alien to me  As that is to you  Yeah yeah yeah  See I don't normally  I'm not normally up  At this time  No  It's only because  Of the time difference  From England  That I'd even be  Valy compost mentis 
[01:58:00]  At this time of the morning  Yeah  So I equally don't  I mean my wife  Used to be a breakfast DJ  I like a breakfast DJ  It's a nice way  To say it  I like that  Better than morning radio  Oh right  In England  We call them breakfast DJs  And I don't understand  Your whole world  Of getting up early  And talking about  What's going on in the news  Just babbling  Yeah  It's just babbling  I think I'll leave it to you  To do that side of it  And you leave it to me  To entertain lunatics  Late at night  I understand though  That you turned down  Madonna and U2  For production stuff  I'm good right 
[01:58:30]  He's trying to make you forget  Let's go to Molly  You turn those people down  I'm very  Is that true  That you at least  Turned them down  That I at least  Had that right  I didn't turn them down  And I just didn't think  I could do a good job  And it's not a diss to them  And I admire both of them  And you know  Because everyone  Everyone always went  Oh the person  Who turned down Madonna  Like I went  Yeah some kind of conflict there  No no no  I just didn't  I was the right person  For the job  Yeah  It would work best for you  Hey let's go to Molly  In Jersey  Molly  Hey  How are you guys doing  Good Molly 
[01:59:00]  You kind of suck  At interviewing  I kind of think  You should stick  With what you know  And have them eat  Like a fresh cooked rat  Or walk around  On mousetraps  Or something  First of all  People praise us  For our interviews  That's right  Exactly  This one got off  To a bad start  But people do praise us  You know  It's the full responsibility  For asking a stupid question  Are those people  That are really special  Are they special people  That praise you  I'd just like to agree  With you  They do suck at interviewing  This is the worst interview  I've done so far today  Wow that's nice 
[01:59:30]  I actually like that  I either want to be  The best or the worst  And we always know  Where we're going to  Wind up in that awful pile  I don't want to fall  In between somewhere  I don't think that was  Very nice of her  We didn't appreciate that  I think you should  Screen your calls  Before you put them  Like in the air  We don't need to do that  Because those are just  Lions say it anyway  So we might as well  Just let it through  It's fine  Joe  Nutley, New Jersey  What's up  We're talking to Fatboy Slim  He's doing the walkover  To XM with us today  So outside the studio  We're giving away  Fatboy Slim  Greatest hit CDs  And DVDs  And Fatboy Slim  Will personally be 
[02:00:00]  Handing those out  You got any more jeans  For people too?  I think so yeah  Alright very cool  You have to phone in  With your sizes  None of our listeners  Stay too long  None of them  Are going to be able  To fit into your 30 jeans  Oh our listeners?  No  They're all fat disasters  One leg goes into each  Yeah they're going to  Take two and sew them together  So they could wear them  Hey go ahead Joe  Hey what's up guys  Hey  I got four of my idols  Sitting there right now  Fatboy  My dog  I actually named Norman  My wife won't let me  Pull off the Fatboy name 
[02:00:30]  So I had to name him Norman  A couple of things  I don't know if you guys  Watch Cribs where Fatboy  Was on right after 9-11  A few things about Fatboy  In his bathroom  He keeps his wedding pictures  In his laundry room  He has old Grammys  So that I think Fatboy  Could tell the story better  What he said on Cribs  While he's ironing his clothes  He gets to look at his Grammys  And realize that he's really  A success  Yeah  And lastly  Ironing your own clothes 
[02:01:00]  I'm sorry  No go ahead sir  The way you're butchering  These stories is really great  It's helping us  That's rich coming from you  At least it's true  I'm a little nervous  I'm just making things up  As I go along  Oh it says you kicked Bono  In the teeth  What happened?  Yeah continue  This is making us look like  James Lipton  So continue bombing please  Don't remember your bomb  Instead of our bombs  Fatboy the question for me  Is what  If you have that big mural  Of New York  In your pool room  How come you haven't 
[02:01:30]  Played here since 04?  That's an interesting question  Took a while to get there  But an interesting question  So what he's saying  Is you hate New York  No no no  It's nothing to do with  America or Americans  I've just been doing other stuff  I've been working on other things  I kind of do beach parties now  Yeah  And we've done Rio  And Bondi Beach  And Brighton Beach  I was going to ask  There's no beach in New York  Well I suppose  Like Coney Island 
[02:02:00]  Or something  Yeah  He's all about the beach parties  Of course he's not coming back to New York  Yeah  No I just haven't got around to it  It's nothing personal  I promise  I was going to ask you  If you're big in England  And the States  And Europe  Are you well received in like Asia?  Have you ever played any  Like Japan?  Japan  I'm bigger in Japan  Than I am in England  So are we  Not odd  We're not even  It's weird  Because in the English music business  If you're not doing very well 
[02:02:30]  You go  Well I'm big in Japan  Yeah  I am actually bigger in Japan  Than I am  I've had like four number ones in a row in Japan  Wow  Brazil  I do very well  Australia  Yeah  I've been having fun in Brazil  And Australian places  Yeah well Brazil  We've heard about that  Did you stay in Rio when you go there?  I was in Rio three times  You know  Just to like meet the locals  I like the little laugh again  You a partier?  Yeah  Yeah  Are you?  Late nights?  Yeah  Well it comes to me the job  If you're a DJ  You can't be 
[02:03:00]  It really does  Yeah  Every DJ you know  Is just like  The pound and some drinks  Or maybe like  Oh I'll be brought up  A little E  Or X  Whatever  Whatever letter they're using  I'm accusing you of drug abuse right now  What's your poison?  And I want to apologize for that  Was that a question  Or just a sheer accusation?  That was a complete accusation  With no facts to back it up whatsoever  Yeah what's your poison?  I would like my lawyer present  Before I answer that question  Sorry about that  Alright let's  Let's go to Dale 
[02:03:30]  Dale in Jersey  Dale  Dale  Hello  Yeah  Go ahead Dale  Yeah  I just wanted to ask  You know  What kind of music  Fatboy's into himself  Like what does he listen to?  Anything that doesn't sound like  What I do  Carpenters  The Beatles  Oh alright  I really like  40s and 50s blues  Just anything that doesn't sound like  The pounding  Really?  The pounding mess  That I do for a living  And you don't like any 
[02:04:00]  New music though?  Yeah I like it  But I always have to listen to it  With a kind of  DJ's head on  Or producer's head on  Yeah  And so you always  So if someone does something good  You're thinking  Hell I wish I'd done that  Or how do I copy that?  Yeah  Without making it really sound like  I'm ripping them off  Yeah  So yeah  New music I find difficult to listen to  With a  You know  For pure enjoyment  And also once I'm in the studio all day  I just want to listen to something  Yeah  You know  Mellow and  Yeah old 
[02:04:30]  Mellow and old  Is what I like  Let's go to Paul  What's up Paul?  Hey guys what's up?  Hey  Hey someone  I've got a question for you  Yeah  How was it working with Christopher Walken  On that video?  Yeah good question  I didn't actually get to work with him  In the video  Because my wife  Stupidly had decided to have  Our first child that weekend  Oh  I was supposed to  Oh god women  Yeah so I figured  It would be better that I stayed at home  And watched the birth  Rather than  Was in the video  Hence I'm not in it  But  I met him when we did 
[02:05:00]  The VMAs  And spent a very entertaining  Three and a half hours with him  Yeah so he's a very nice man  And  A little odd  No  No  He looks so odd  But he's actually really friendly  And he like knows a lot about  English soccer  It took to be  Really?  English soccer hooligans  I'm like how do you know that?  And he was  Researched a film that was never made  But  Got into  English soccer hooligans  Which is a weird thing  You wouldn't  Last thing you'd expect to be  Talking to Christopher Walken  Yeah  But no he's

[02:16:30]  So while he's blowing you  We call it Spiffkin's Gap  We call it Spiffkin's Gap  Spiffkin's Gap?

Oh okay  Then my jokes didn't make sense  That didn't happen 
[02:18:00]  A voice telling you to kill a child  No I was  Sicko  You guys weren't getting that horrific feedback?  No  Oh well  I was getting that in my headphones  And that's when I said  I thought someone wearing your t-shirts  That's good feedback  He's obviously a fan  Yeah he's hot  I was very nice of that gentleman  One gift  To lambast the team that is in first place  What do you think our gifts are going to be?  What?  What are our gifts going to be?  A piece of highly propelled lead 
[02:18:30]  Going through our heads  I don't trust that guy  A little creepy  Hey there they are  How are you doing?  Very good  Him and his very attractive girlfriend  Remember?

[02:19:30]  All right  Did everyone get their Fatboy Slim CDs?  Yeah  Greatest hit CD is in stores now  I do believe  And the DVD as well  All right  We're going to go upstairs  And do some more radio  Thank you guys  Thank you  I saw you last night  I had a great time  Thanks Val  Thank you guys  Take care  That's a little twist to the whole thing  Yeah that's  Oh  That sucks 
[02:20:00]  Lesbian  I like that in the woman  And every other kind of DVD  I love paying for sex  This moral decay  Huh?  Weakens our resistance  Dude  To the onslaught of the communist masters of disease  We're a bunch of scumbags  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children  Jackass  I can't believe it  It's a pedophile humor  Woo  It's depressing and horrendous 
[02:20:30]  It's awful  A bunch of idiots  Perversion for power  Here it comes  Here it comes  The Opie and Anthony program  The Opie and Anthony  God that irritates me  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us  Opie  I want my coffee  Anthony  I want that fact  Jim Norton  I want Ozzy  We are going to dumb this thing down 
[02:21:00]  To the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children  No baby  That's terrible  The Opie and Anthony show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  I want to go on the road  We are going to talk very fast  guitar solo 
[02:21:30]  guitar solo 
[02:22:00]  Good evening, good evening, good evening, good evening. 
[02:22:30]  Something crap PalTalk crapped out over there.  Yeah.  On our FM side of the show.  My headphones were so fucked up.  Were they?  It was the worst feedback.  It was horrific.  I thought you guys were all hearing the same thing, but I guess it was just my headset or something.  Your little earbuds.  Hey, where's the Fatboy CD?  Now I want to hear the rest of that song.  We should give him the big plug for the greatest hit CD.  Did he leave or is he coming in?  No, he left. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, that was it for him?  Something's wrong with the PalTalk.  Huh?  Something's wrong with the PalTalk.  Staying logging on.  I think it's down for some kind of maintenance.  What happened?  Thanks, man.  That's nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's see.  We'll play this from the greatest hit CD because Fatboy Slim was a real good sport today.  Greatest hit CD.  Actually, this is a new song.  We played it just a piece a little while ago.  Here it is.  I've got to take a leak and stuff.  It's that old pair of jeans from Fatboy Slim. 
[02:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  All you used to do was put me down.  But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground.  And all you used to do was criticize me.  But now I find a good and a help for size.  You see, you would always get some sensitive. 
[02:24:30]  And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness.  But now I'm certain of the way I live.  And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game.  And it's such a shame that you try to make pain.  Another word for my name.  Whether giving or receiving is one of the same.  Just one more leak in your long-ass shame.  But it's time to break this frame of my strength.  Well, time to jump off this negative cycle we've built.  Gave my heart, put myself, respect you, won't steal.  Now it's time to let you go if you can't hear or film it all.  So I asked my mama for her two cents. 
[02:25:00]  And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend.  And then I asked my papa once and I asked him again.  Chained to the consensus from holding opinions. 
[02:25:30]  And life is too short to be unhappy.  And since I know what I'm worth, there'll be no sense to lend for dirt.  Knowing what I deserve is gold.  If I want diamonds, then I can't settle for gold.  And maybe I was just too strong to let go.  And maybe I was just too weak to let it show.  And maybe I was just too stubborn to say no.  But whatever the case, I can't take it no more.  I can't take it no more. 
[02:26:00]  Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it on us 
[02:26:30]  Like a favorite pair of jeans that you won't give up  One in a hole, maybe one of these arguments will make up  And start again like when we had started this up  Back when everything was fresh and every moment of bliss  And I'd laugh at all of your jokes  You should listen to my suggestions  One mind, one soul, one common destination  Now I can't help but fight over the direction  Get away all the words 
[02:27:00]  Get away all the words  Get away all the words  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:28:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:28:30]  Not many celebrities want to do the walkover with us.  People read too much into things, I think, sometimes.  You guys are the celebrities.  You've got to know that coming in.  We're not number one in Japan, sir.  Sometimes we celebrate others.  What?  From the word celebrate.  Celebratee. 
[02:29:00]  What did you think was pompous about him, Kenny?  You know what?  It just seemed like, I don't know.  I guess I did have a different perspective.  I would be in there like kissing your feet.  He was having fun, man.  He was actually really cool.  It seemed like too cool for the room, maybe.  I don't know.  Nah.  I honestly think he misread him, dude.  He was just doing his thing.  That's what he's about.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  He admittedly, a lot of these guys are a little uncomfortable doing radio.  They're not too sure how to do it.  That's not something they do as much. 
[02:29:30]  Mike in New Hampshire, what's up?  Yeah.  When Anthony put him in check, when Anthony told him that you guys were going to be on Letterman 2,  what was his facial expression?  Did he look?  That was a good one, actually.  That was a good one.  He just kind of looked, yeah.  He didn't know if he...  Probably thought I was lying.  He didn't know if he should believe us or not, yeah.  Since, you know, the mood was set at the beginning as us lying.  I think it was pompous, too. 
[02:30:00]  Huh?  That was so good.  I loved watching Jimmy's face as he scrambled to figure out why is the question I just asked him completely ridiculous.  Yeah, it was written kind of oddly in the bio sheet.  It was, yeah.  Jimmy, I was going to suggest that you ask him how he liked doing the video of I Hate Everything About You.  What's that?  Hate Everything About You?  I don't know the phone.  Oh, shoot.  I suck.  Was that a joke? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I suck.  I feel like something cakey today.  Yeah?  Along with my smoothie.  Is there something cakey?  Appley and cakey.  Ooh, would that be nice?  Yeah.  Something like that.  If not, some kind of a muffin, but something more cake than muffin.  Corn muffins?  Out of the question.  Brand muffins?  Ugh.  You want a brand muffin?  Something like a marble cake muffin thing.  Ew.  Oh, marble, who doesn't like marble cake, you freak?  I love it. 
[02:31:00]  I like to put my cock fringe in it and then put it back on the shelf.  Give it to Jimmy first, then give it to me.  I'm getting excited for you because I know exactly where to get a nice marble cake muffin.  There you go.  And he's the man.  Bob Kelly.  Yo, what's up, man?  Hi there, Bobby.  We had to talk to Fatboy Slim, so we missed you.  Well, we tried to listen in to your interview, but it was really hard to hear.  Dude, he had no idea.  I was like, yeah, it's me, Jay Davis, John Carr.  It's a real funny comic.  He's little him. 
[02:31:30]  I said it twice.  He had no idea.  Oh, wow.  We've got to get the audio.  John Carr, that ghoul.  That son of a bitch slapped me in the face.  And then, what's his name?  Gene Levanchi?  Who slapped you?  Well, Jay Davis came over.  He was off to the side.  I was doing the interview.  So I called him over, and I was like, yeah, we fought a little bit on the show, but we're  doing the show together.  We're friends now, and I kind of apologized to him.  Jay just cracked me in the face. 
[02:32:00]  Jesus.  So then Gene Levanchi slaps me in the face.  And then I wound up cracking Gene Levanchi in the face.  Yeah, we heard some kind of a ruckus going on.  Gene Levanchi, I mean, I'm not even kidding.  He didn't even hold back.  He just smashed me in the face, and he's the size of a lineman on a hockey team.  Why did he slap you besides just a desire people have when they see that face?  That's true. 
[02:32:30]  That face was built to be slapped.  Yeah?  Oh, thanks, Jim.  I appreciate it.  We have the same face, mushy chin.  But then he saw Jay slap me.  He goes, you want to slap me back?  So I was like, yeah, I do.  Take your glasses off.  This was all on live TV?  Live TV.  And then I just, I'm not even kidding you, I didn't even hold back.  I cracked that son of a bitch across his cheek.  I thought he was going to hit me.  I got to see that.  Why did he slap you?  I don't know, because Jay slapped me. 
[02:33:00]  And then I, Jay came back in and slapped, I slapped him to get him back.  And then he goes, I go, you want to slap me?  He goes, yeah, sure.  And I didn't think he was going to do it.  I thought he was just kidding, because he's Gene Levanchi.  And then he just cracked me across the face.  We got to get the video.  I don't even know what happened.  I feel like I just got into a fight.  Was it friendly, though?  Dude, everybody was laughing.  I slapped Gene Levanchi in the face.  Who's Gene Levanchi?  Dude, he's like a hometown, he used to do sports for, you know, 
[02:33:30]  I grew up with the guy.  He's been up there forever.  So, you know, I kept saying John Carr, and I think I said it two or three times,  and he had no idea.  He's like, that's good.  Good for you.  That's great.  That sounds fun.  Can we get that?  In a few minutes.  All right, we're going to have it in a few minutes.  Hey, Bob.  Yo.  You also were on CNN recently.  Yeah.  You're blowing up, buddy.  Why were you on CNN?  I was on Spike TV, too, last night.  Like I said, you were on CNN recently. 
[02:34:00]  You know what?  I'll tell you, Spike TV, that son of a bitch.  Can I?  I'm just kidding.  Are you friendly with that guy?  Who?  What's his name?  Sharipa.  I don't know.  Steve Sharipa?  Yeah.  No, he blew us off.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I'm going to tell you something, this guy.  This guy, I go on, right?  I'm on the show.  He literally tells me right off the bat he hates comedians.  That's good.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  I go, yeah, because he used to book the club, the Riviera.  Yeah.  I go, oh, you club owners, you guys are really happy to get together, though. 
[02:34:30]  No, you guys don't have any problems at all.  And then he, actually, whatever, we're fucking busting balls, and he keeps saying some gay shit.  Torgasm's gay.  I'm like, dude, Torgasm's gay?  What about your show, Johnny Cakes?  And so I'm trying to bust balls, have fun.  And then I start joking around with the other people, like, you know, the people in the background.  And he goes, listen, all right, save it for your show later.  Save the funny for your show later.  We got business.  Who said we got business? 
[02:35:00]  He did.  Here's why.  Because when someone is trying to be funny and break balls, hey, get you whacked!  Will ya?  And then a comedian comes with real wit.  They don't have anything really to say.  And that's probably why he was uncomfortable with it, because you were being funnier than him.  You're lucky he didn't throw a gun at his doosh.  Yeah, I'll make you look like a bio-maragota.  Will ya?  Yeah, and they just kept talking.  They just kept talking.  Like, they're supposed to ask me shit, but they just kept yapping, and they just kept reading. 
[02:35:30]  Like, they just wanted to get that.  We're on XM, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, Bob.  This is all on the air with Sharipa?  Dude, this is all on the air.  And no, the line about, you know, yeah, all right, comic.  You know, save the funny for your show later.  We got business to do.  What business do they have to do?  I don't even know the show.  Dude, it's Spike TV.  It's like dinner and a movie, except it's fucking, you know, like they have like me, him, Howard  Stone's girl, I think it is. 
[02:36:00]  The blonde girl.  Yeah.  And you just sit there, and they're basically supposed to ask you questions.  Wait, when did you tape that show?  Like two weeks ago.  Oh, okay, never mind.  So, you know.  I wanted to see if she had a cast on, you know.  A what?  Nothing.  It's a callback.  Go ahead.  So, yeah, dude, it was atrocious.  Yeah.  I mean, who tells a comic not to be funny?  Yeah, don't be funny.  What do you want to talk about?  The news?  You get the USA Today, you fat bastard.  Right.  Oh, wait, this is all on Spike TV? 
[02:36:30]  This is all on Spike TV.  I'm sorry about that.  I was confused.  I think you saw him today.  No, no.  It was on his show.  And I was actually really looking forward to it, because he, you know, I thought he,  you know, he, comics, he knows comics.  He says, I hate comics.  Oh, thanks.  Cool.  Well, he'd probably dealt with a lot of douchebags, but.  I don't know, but you don't tell me that, you son of a bitch.  All right, Bob, so you were on CNN commenting on Britney Spears.  We got the audio.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You didn't like it?  It was, no, they cut out a lot of stuff. 
[02:37:00]  I actually, the line they, they cut out, I did a nice Rich Voss plug into it, and they  cut out a line about Michael Jackson, so they kind of edited it like VH1 to make it  more tame, so.  Ew.  What was the Michael Jackson line?  Uh, I said something about, uh, you know, Britney Spears got the past torch, uh, from  Madonna.  She made out with, uh, Britney, and that was kind of passing the torch to, uh, Britney.  And, uh, you know, a lot of people do that.  Michael, uh, I said something about Michael Jackson passes the torch, but, you know, he  does it to little kids.  All right.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  Well, uh, let's listen, let's listen to the audio.  Of course, it's the Britney Spears stuff.  Another thing that is, uh, on YouTube that everyone's checking out, uh, her talking with  Kevin, I, they look like they're fucked up, either smoking pot or drunk or something, and  then they have all these, uh, pot thoughts, and they talked about time travel.  Yeah, she called it time, speed, space travel.  Time, speed, space travel.  What a dope.  So here's Bob Kelly on CNN commenting.  And while some are taking this latest Britney sighting in stride, it really is not going 
[02:38:00]  to hurt her image at all.  Her fans know that Britney Spears is just a pretty, you know, down to earth, simple,  low key girl.  And this is exactly what she's doing in the video.  She's hanging out, having some snacks, having fun.  This really isn't going to hurt her career at all.  Others got a look at Britney's whacked out theories on time travel.  Are you asking back to the future?  Mm-hmm.  Is that possible?  To time, try, try to speak?  Mm-hmm.  Yes, it is.  And they're taking their shots at her.  You know, she just went out and bought a DeLorean, too.  She's putting, she put a, she put a Jack LaLanne, uh, juicer on the back of it. 
[02:38:30]  She's sticking cabbage in it right now.  It don't work.  Honey, it don't work.  Dude, dude, you gotta put lettuce in.  I've seen them use lettuce, dude.  You sure?  Yeah.  Wow.  Hello.  Wow.  Hello.  Do you know right now, I, I, I don't blame anybody who's slapped your face in the last  five years.  Whoa.  Right now, John Ramsey is having bigger laughs at the news he just got. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  They really, they really cut that up.  Yeah.  Yeah, they must have.  They did it out all the good stuff.  They did a chumerectomy.  What do you want to do, Lucky Louie on CNN in the afternoon?  Atta boy.  Good plug.  I'll take it.  All right.  I actually, I actually did a great plug and they cut it because if, oh, they pissed me  off.  I did.  Look, we're talking about Britney today.  We're not talking about the Stones.  We're not talking about, uh, you two.  We're not talking about Robert Kelly at the comedy connection in Boston Friday, Saturday 
[02:39:30]  night this week.  Ah, bravo.  But you're splitting the comedy connections.  That's going to confuse everybody.  Tonight, it's the one in, uh, Saugus.  Saugus, Massachusetts at the fucking Calhoun.  Saugus.  At the Calhoun or something like that?  Dude, it's the Calhoun, dude.  It's fucking wicked awesome.  And then Friday, Saturday, the one in Boston.  All right.  Here's, uh, has it hurt her reputation?  Bob Kelly on CNN.  Saugus Tonight is wondering.  After months of tabloid coverage of her marriage to Kevin Federline, her missteps with her baby,  and now this clip, are people now laughing with Britney or at her? 
[02:40:00]  How about music videos?  Can we try that again?  Maybe we get back to the old singing routine.  Back when Britney was doing the old singing routine, beginning with Hit Me Baby One More  Time, Britney quickly became an iconic superstar.  She sold more than 76 million records worldwide.  I live for Britney Spears.  She did it all, from commercials to perfume and even kissing Madonna. 
[02:40:30]  She made out with Madonna.  You know, you have to be big to make out with Madonna.  All right?  Not only do you have to be a woman, but you have to be big.  She was the biggest thing for a minute.  I mean, she was it.  She was the next Madonna for a second.  And then, you know.  Um.  Can we sit here for a second?  Wait a minute.  I want to put out an open call to any comedians.  We have a vacancy on the O&I Traveling Virus Tour show.  Listen, jackass.  They called me at 10 that morning for a 12-day.  Where were you?  At a wake? 
[02:41:00]  What do you want me to do?  That was a pretty good line.  Yo, dude.  That's dumb.  That was a pretty good line, dude.  Oh, wait.  Dude.  Where were you?  Um.  Britney, dude.  She made out with Madonna.  You've got to be big to make out with Madonna.  I mean, not only do you have to be a woman, but you've got to be big.  That was a pretty good line.  But that's the line.  That's the line.  They cut it up, dude.  They had the other line, the Michael Jackson line, but they wouldn't use that.  And then the plug was in that.  It was pretty funny.  What are they trying to do?  Like a VH1 thing on CNN? 
[02:41:30]  Well, yeah.  Dude, I have no idea.  They called me up.  Do you want to do CNN?  Of course I do.  What do you think?  They wanted you to talk about the war?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, I thought, yeah.  I mean, you know, Hezbollah and Lebanon, I mean, and Israel.  There's certain things going on that I know about that maybe could help the situation.  They got a juicer on the back of their tanks.  I'm telling her, put in lettuce.  She bought a Lamborghini.  It's got a juicer on it.  And then you realize it wasn't going the way you want, so you started naming things she put in there. 
[02:42:00]  Dude, you got hot peppers.  You got red peppers.  You got green peppers.  You got lettuce.  They put a whole bunch of celery.  Oh, please be a funny vegetable coming up.  Put in Karen and Quinlan.  Sorry, at the end of every sentence, I didn't go, yuck.  Well, maybe you should have.  Maybe you should have slapped the reporter in the face.  Put my cock all over your Darth Vader cheeks.  All right, Bob, we have one more clip from CNN.  By the way, at The Connection, Bob will be doing the complete version of the Lamborghini juicer bit. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, and I like to fucking stick my dick in your mini disc recorder.  All right, I'll smash your foot, foot on the foot thing.  And driving mishaps with her son, Sean Preston, made her a bit of a tabloid joke.  Anything with a baby, you know, it ruined Michael Jackson and it ruined Britney.  Okay, you can't have kids.  And if you do have kids, adopt them, like Brad and Angelina.  But some say, don't count Britney out. 
[02:43:00]  You can keep an eye on her.  She's really going to come into her own the next few years.  She's gone back into the studio right now.  She's recording another album.  So she's certainly not playing.  She's playing a rapper for her next child to get back on the road, keep touring, put another album out.  So I think we're just going to have to wait and see what, you know, this next album produces and see what kind of star she's going to become.  And no matter what you have to say about her video on YouTube, we are still talking about it.  Whenever a person did that, took that little video, dumb clip, it worked because we're talking about her.  We're not talking about anybody else today.  We're not talking about you two.  We're not talking about The Stones. 
[02:43:30]  We're talking about Britney Spears.  So, touche, Britney.  You did it.  Good for you.  What?  That did the big cut in it.  You go, girl.  Cut the good stuff.  I'm with Bob.  No, dude.  I said, I go, they're not talking about you two.  They're not talking about Bob Kelly at The Comedy Connection.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  You know, it was a great plug.  And the guy, you know, the guy was laughing his ass off.  I said some stuff about a vagina.  Oh, that's good for CNN.  It's CNN, Bob.  But I said it with a B.  I made it cute.  Oh.  What was the other line before this? 
[02:44:00]  What was the line right before this?  Oh, yeah, because that was the one.  Anything with a...  The baby.  Anything with a baby?  Wait, what was that?  How did he say it?  Anything with a baby, don't have a baby.  And if you're going to adopt, like Brad and Angelina.  Oh, like the fact that, yeah, why don't you just say, why don't you just say Bennifer?  What the fucking, like Brad and Angelina.  Who are you, a fucking big-titted blonde on Entertainment Tonight?  It is, it is, it is.  Let me tell you what's happening, dude.  Hold on, let's say hi to Manny in Jersey.  Manny, you saw Bob Kelly on Spike TV? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I saw him last night on that, where they play casino games.  It's Stern's horse-faced girlfriend and the guy from Big Pussy or whatever from...  Shereppa, yeah.  Shereppa, yeah.  They were just reading their script off the teleprompter.  Teleprompter, like the idiots they are.  And every time Bob tried to do something impromptu, it just walked all over him.  It was ridiculous.  Hey, Bob, they were following a script?  Dude, they have the teleprompter, but they sent me one with Dennis Rodman, and they were 
[02:45:00]  talking to Dennis.  It was...  Look, I don't blame them.  Who the fuck is Bob Kelly?  But they were just reading...  The times they're supposed to be talking to me, they just kept reading the teleprompter,  like, let's get the fuck out of here.  Right, right.  Who is Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly...  Bob Kelly is the originator...  Bob Kelly?  No, Bob Kelly is the originator of the Porsche 911 juice man bit.  Bob Kelly is the man who pointed out that Brad and Angelina, I want to just mush my almonds 
[02:45:30]  into your face right now.  And he also...  He's also the guy that pointed out that you have the same face as a thumb puppet.  Yeah, he did point out that hurtful fact.  All right.  Bob, what do you think of Britney?  I love that juicer.  Babies or adoption, Bob?  What?  What? 
[02:46:00]  What?  Oh, just get Betsy.  I want to see you, me, the Lamborghini, the juicer, we're all getting cookies.  Is this on?  Let's go to Bill in Minnesota.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  I had a chance to watch CNN.  Actually, I thought the interview went pretty well.  You thought Bob did well on CNN?  Thank you.  Thank you, dude.  It's not you.  Oh, God. 
[02:46:30]  Wow, Bob.  This son of a bitch really got me.  I fell for it, too.  Yeah, Bob.  That's got to hurt.  All right, listen.  One of Beth's comments were completely off.  Space with you, Bob.  I didn't appreciate when I heard this.  Yeah, that's uncalled for.  She was actually really nice.  Shut up.  All right, nice talking to you.  All right, Bob.  Here's the deal. 
[02:47:00]  We're trying to get your TV appearance, but our system just broke down.  So stay close so we can call you back, okay?  All right, cool.  You got it, guys.  Comedy Connection, Boston tonight.  Tonight, the Saugus Comedy Connection at that restaurant.  Tonight, Saugus.  And then Comedy Connection in Boston Friday and Saturday night.  Yeah, Bob's taping his CD.  Bob didn't take any guff from Beth Ola.  No?  No.  Here's his comment.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  Wow.  And they punched each other in the face. 
[02:47:30]  How did you get that off of you?  Way to play along.  All right, Bob.  Way to play along.  Jesus.  My God.  I like your improv skills.  They're terrific.  All right, Bob.  We're going to call you back when we get that TV thing fixed.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you.  All right.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Very good.  God, more creepy news after creepy news coming out about that...  That guy?  That John Carr.  Apparently, let's say, when she was killed and called the 60s, he said it was an accident. 
[02:48:00]  He loved her.  But then they got kind of a back story.  He moved to Petaluma, California, which was the same town that Polly Clasp was killed in.  Like, so he had this whole fixation with violent child deaths.  Yeah.  Well, Richard Allen Davis, I believe, murdered Polly Clasp.  Yeah.  But he just, like, had this fascination. 
[02:48:30]  Even his family was a little, like, taken aback by his fascination.  He was writing, like, he was a struggling writer.  And he was writing this book that he wanted to put out about child rape and killing.  And Clasp was killed before JonBenet, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Just, ugh, what a creepy guy.  Yeah, there's a lot of people that get off on not only his kiddie porn, but on, like, fucking really hurting kids.  I mean, this guy was obviously some kind of a sexual psychopath.  And he should, if he's guilty, he should just be executed. 
[02:49:00]  He probably really thought, like, they were in love.  And he was doing some kind of, you know, asphyxiation thing.  Erotic asphyxiation with her.  And she died.  And him thinking, oh, it was an accident.  What?  We were just, like, you know, like as if they were consenting adults doing something.  And he's six years old.  What a ghoul.  Just a ghoul.  It's going to be interesting.  Yeah, the more story comes out.  And then they'll make a movie about it.  Of course.  You have to just.  Every network will. 
[02:49:30]  You have to just hope that they don't put him in protective custody in jail.  They will, though.  They always do.  You hear?  Who was the last guy?  Come on.  Where's that guy?  Jesse Kemenikis.  Where's the guy that killed that adorable girl with the little pink Kangol hat on?  Remember her in Florida?  In Florida, yeah.  His name is Paul something.  Where is he?  He's being protected.  Obviously, he's on trial.  He should be dead.  He buried her alive.  Yeah.  Buried her alive.  And that guy should be dead.  Yeah.  You always think, you know, oh, this would be great.  I'd go into prison.  And you see that movie prison justice thing. 
[02:50:00]  A little Shawshank in the laundry room thing.  Maybe.  The girls will come in and get him.  But it never happens.  Never happens.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got some audio from the doghouse throwing us under the bus or something.  But did we badmouth Roz?  I don't think so.  No.  It's a whole thing they're doing.  Is it?  I think they badmouth Roz and then said it was us or something.  I don't know.  We'll get into it next.  I don't.  That's some other things. 
[02:50:30]  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right.  Okay.  Terrific.  I'm going to put your mouth roll balls on.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, Leslie.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes. 
[02:51:00]  Precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  All right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's go to Marcus in Asheville.  What's up, Marcus?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  How are y'all? 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yesterday, dude, Ron and Fez were just totally fucking dogging you guys, man.  Talking shit.  What the hell is going on with that?  We're not allowed to talk about it.  Oh, boy.  Shut up.  It's in human resources' hands at this point.  All right.  So they're going to be kicked off?  We're not allowed to talk about it.  Okay.  So wait, wait, wait.  So if they do get kicked off...  We're not allowed to talk about it.  But could we have like a show with Jimmy and some of the other guys from the Traveling  Virus Tour, dude?  That would fucking kick ass.  That would be fun, right? 
[02:52:00]  That would be a blast.  Here's the bottom line, dude.  And without giving away any details, I heard some of their show yesterday, and Fez referred  to himself as gregarious.  I mean, if that doesn't say what needs to be said, then nothing does, dude.  All right.  Let's just move on.  Rob in Virginia.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  My son wants to talk to you real quick.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear it.  What's he wearing?  Hello?  Hey.  What's up? 
[02:52:30]  You guys got me in trouble with my mom.  Why?  What happened?  My brother and his friends were picking on me, and I called him a bunch of shit dicks.  How old are you?  Ten.  You're a good boy.  You're on your way.  I called him a bunch of shit dicks.  That's actually something you should call your teacher as well.  You know what?  You sound like you should be helping an older gentleman that just got out of a mental institution 
[02:53:00]  for killing his mother.  What?  All right.  Dad.  I like the way you talk, too, boy.  You're just a boy.  You shouldn't use language like that.  You got any potty and meat?  Ask your dad if he's a shit dick.  Right now.  Go, daddy.  Hello?  No, we lost him.  Where'd he go?  I want to hear his voice again.  He's so independable.  All right.  Who brought the doghouse audio in?  What is this about?  Sam knows?  Get her in here. 
[02:53:30]  Where's this raceless, genderless anomaly?  Hey, what's that?  Is there a mic on out there?  Sounds like something going on.  There.  Okay.  There was.  Heard something out there.  Out there, he's yelling and screaming and leaving his post.  Sam, what's this about?  Eric actually brought it to my attention yesterday.  Sounds like people see when they're hypnotized after a UFO abduction. 
[02:54:00]  Like that.  We're here to talk about David and Elvis.  Well, we have to talk about you for a couple minutes, then we move on.  That's a few minutes.  You know the deal at this point.  Did he try on the jeans?  No, I haven't yet.  Did Travis try on the fat boy slim jeans?  They fit perfectly.  No, you didn't try them on?  Aren't you guys going to try on the jeans?  Sure.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys have on a jeans-trying party?  Two of you in a room.  That's the bit.  All right.  What do you know about this? 
[02:54:30]  Well, they had Roz.  JV and Elvis, the doghouse, had Roz from-  That's the show on after us here in New York City when we're doing the commercial radio thing.  They had Roz from Last Comic Standing on the air yesterday.  Oh, she's a tip.  Yeah.  And they'd said some derogatory things about her before while Last Comic Standing was still on,  and they weren't saying them to her face when she was on, and the listeners started to call them out.  Uh-oh.  And one listener actually had a recording of them saying such things. 
[02:55:00]  Gotta love the listeners.  Well, now, did they throw this show under the bus as a goof, like we would do?  Like, oh, that wasn't us, that was so-and-so, just to kind of be funny about it?  You could probably tell through the audio, I bet.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's what we're leading to, trying to figure it out.  They moved on pretty quick from ONA.  As soon as ONA came up, it seemed like JV kind of wanted to steer away completely from the show.  Yeah.  Because he realized there might be consequences.  Oh. 
[02:55:30]  Or maybe just a nice guy.  Maybe.  Well, let's listen in.  You have a little fun.  You have a little chin.  Caller has a recording of JV and Elvis smashing Roz from Last Comic Standing.  They say it's ONA.  Here's the audio.  Tim, how you doing, man out of Connecticut?  What's up?  Dog house.  What?  Come on.  Come on.  Come away.  Come on, man.  Eat fresh?  It's a way fresh.  You guys are such liars.  What?  You guys do not like this woman.  I like her.  We're getting along.  She said we're going to have sex.  It doesn't matter, babe. 
[02:56:00]  Exactly.  How do you feel about me, darling?  Sometimes I'm out of the area, and my mom tapes the show for me.  Okay.  What a dork.  Okay, gay, but whatever.  Shut up.  So your mom says that we said it?  Yeah, she said you said it, and listen to this.  Last Comic Standing last night, did you see it?  I did.  Yes, I did.  What did you think?  Some of the guys are good.  Some of the guys are okay.  Right.  I like them.  There's a couple that are really good.  Some are okay, and then some suck.  I like Chris Porter, funny guy.  Had a really good set. 
[02:56:30]  And Ty Barnett, I thought you were pretty good.  Ty Barnett.  Which one is Ty Barnett?  The guy with the hat?  The black guy?  Black guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's pretty good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got you guys on tape.  Are people, do they love him because they feel sorry for him, or?  I think so.  I don't know.  I think he's funny.  He's got some terrible palsy.  I think they're laughing at him, not with him.  No, I think it's a combination.  But I have to ask you about this lady, Roz.  Oh, my God.  Not funny.  She's terrible.  She is horrible.  She doesn't have jokes.  She doesn't have a problem. 
[02:57:00]  Hold on.  I'm trying to hear this.  Oh, brother.  Wow, is that clear audio?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Not funny.  She's terrible.  She is horrible.  She doesn't have jokes.  She doesn't have any.  I got problems.  You don't have anything funny.  Yeah, thanks for the call, but that's not us.  That's O&A.  That was not us.  That was our show.  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  It just sounded like they were trying to use us to bail out of an awkward situation.  Yeah, they got caught with their pants down.  Yeah.  And she was right there in the studio as they were playing that audio.  That's great.  Not only just like a passing remark.  It was just, oh, she sucks.  And then they do one of her lines.  I have problems.  No, you don't have anything funny to say.  Wow.  They did like a real accurate surgery on her act.  Why don't they go with it?  I don't know.  Maybe they did afterwards.  Well, then we got more here. 
[02:58:00]  It's okay.  That's the show before.  I don't like those guys neither.  Yeah.  I don't like those guys neither.  Yeah, yeah.  That's okay.  That's the show before.  I don't like those guys neither.  Yeah.  See, I think they're corny.  Yeah.  Well, and that was them.  Yeah.  It's okay.  We wouldn't do that.  Can't please everybody, honey.  Exactly.  Can't please everybody.  Can't take comments.  You can't be in this business.  Thank you.  And look where you're at.  You're in New York City doing Carolina.  Yeah, I'm all over the cash.  12th place show in the market.  Yeah, 12th place show right here. 
[02:58:30]  Right here.  You did a national TV show.  You're one of the finalists.  Give me a break.  Yeah, thank you.  That is bull crap.  I'll be bigger than all those, literally.  Yes.  I'm bigger than them now.  Exactly.  But let me drop a drink on you, America.  Famous people never win contests.  Right, right.  You know, I got to hand it to them.  They did a pretty good job of bailing themselves out by throwing us under the bus.  Yeah.  They bailed themselves out knowing the whole audience knew it was their audio.  Yeah.  Which makes it into a pretty good bit to them.  That was actually funny. 
[02:59:00]  She didn't hate the show.  She just had to say something because she just got trashed.  Jay Carney.  I don't think she knows the show.  Of course she doesn't.  We're not in that demo.  No, that wasn't that.  Black people.  We're not broadcast on Kong Island.  I don't remember to call any of them tuning in radios during the movie.  Holy shit.  Even though I just had to call out. 
[02:59:30]  Doesn't matter.  It works.  Holy shit.  Let's see.  Other things.  Just doing some cleanup here.  Yes.  Cleaning up shop.  People are talking about what Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark did at a Red Sox game.  They did a little play-by-play in the booth.  Oh, yeah.  And they got a little saucy.  Did they?  Yeah, a little bit. 
[03:00:00]  They referenced Mel Gibson.  Saucy are they going to let him get?  They referenced Mel Gibson in the booth.  All right.  Red Sox superfan and comedian Dennis Leary isn't one to hold his tongue.  He loves his team, especially first baseman Kevin Euclid, who happens to be Jewish.  Leary, however, doesn't.  Like, doesn't sound like the biggest Mel Gibson fan.  But Gibson has apologized for anti-Semitic remarks he made.  But last night, in the Red Sox booth, Leary seized the opportunity to have some fun.  Take a listen. 
[03:00:30]  That's fantastic.  We got a Jewish first base, but I didn't know that.  I'm so proud to have a Jewish first base.  I didn't even.  So am I.  I hope Mel Gibson doesn't come into this box.  We'll run him out of here on a rail.  Get it.  Nice.  Now, where's Mel Gibson now?  Where's Mel Gibson now?  Huh?  He's in rehab.  And Euclid is at first base.  All right, Mel.  You happy, brave, huh?  Huh?  You see that, grab Mel?  Huh?  I hope in rehab they're showing a replay of that.  The other broadcasters in the booth can't even spit words out there laughing so hard. 
[03:01:00]  Now, despite this, the Tigers beat the Red Sox.  There's nothing there either.  Who cares?  This is the best part.  We'll just have a little fun, man.  The score at the end.  Speaking of, yeah, you got those gifts?  The guy that had the Yankee sucks t-shirt?  Why not, man?  Sure, why not?  Yeah, but first.  Jesus.  Fucking Arnold anxious.  Comes running right in. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, all right.  Hey, pay attention to Kenny.  With a lime green Pittsburgh Opie and Anthony shirt.  Yeah.  That's got to change.  Well, I got a black XM Opie and Anthony shirt, too.  But I just picked this one up in the market that's closing next Tuesday.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Look at Eagle Eye Kenny is looking at that bag and will look at everything you pull out of it.  If anything looks like a weapon, your head will be removed before you even know it.  I've already had Master Post finger up my ass.  I have to go back at it in a little while.  The bag, I guess.  It's a pleasure.  Hold on a second. 
[03:02:00]  Dan in Tennessee, what's up?  How come you guys aren't calling J.D. and Elvis out?  That's the second time they've said shit about y'all and you're letting them say it?  Nah, see, now that I hear the audio, I see it another way.  They were in an uncomfortable position.  There's a few things you could do.  You could go at it with her and go, yeah, I guess we did say that.  You do suck and really get uncomfortable.  Or they could try to save their asses, say it's Opie and Anthony audio, knowing their audience knows it's them.  And now the trick is on her.  It was a funny way to get out of a tight situation.  Yeah, because now she's thinking it was Opie and Anthony when everyone listening to the show knows it actually was them. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, it was clever.  That was funny what they did.  So what do we even do?  Be mad at them for being funny?  I don't know.  It's just kind of strange.  You know, they're trying to say that you ripped them off with the traveling virus when they had their thing that they were doing.  I don't think they said that at all.  I think what they were mad at was that management, they wanted management to back their tour.  And then this show comes along.  And understandably, they're probably annoyed about it.  But I don't think they accused us of ripping them off.  We were planning a virus tour before we got kicked off any W.  When we get problems with people, we attack, and it's brutal. 
[03:03:00]  But there's no problem here.  Yeah.  You're trying to make a problem out of something that ain't a problem.  We thought there might be a problem before we heard the audio, but, you know, we see it a different way.  There's a funny, clever way of getting out of a jam.  I just don't like it when they talk shit about anybody who used ONA for something.  They weren't talking shit, though.  They were smiling the whole time saying it was Opie and Anthony audio, knowing their audience knew it was them.  It was a goof.  It was obvious.  All right.  You guys win.  Thank you, sir.  I think the gag is on her because she really thinks it's Opie and Anthony. 
[03:03:30]  Dig it out of line.  Believe me, we'll send Travis in there to suck both their dicks.  That'll teach him.  So what do you got there, bro?  All right.  Well, I got two things.  I got something for Anthony.  I got something for Jimmy.  Now, Jimmy, would you like yours first or would you like to wait?  I don't know.  Whatever is the lightest, you should take out last.  Okay, then you'll get to wait.  Ooh.  All right.  Now, Ant, this bag is obviously a big piece of crap, but it's for you to protect you.  You see, I listen a lot. 
[03:04:00]  Now, I am one of those rare XM Opie and Anthony fans.  I got to Opie and Anthony through XM.  You're not that rare.  That's true.  I'm sorry.  Is there a head?  I have something for you.  No, there's no head in here.  However, a friend of mine got back from Desert Storm, brought me a chemical warfare outfit  that you might want to wear the next time Tippi Tom's in this room.  Oh, that'd be nice.  So, if you'd like to hand the top to Anthony.  He's never going to wear that.  I also...  Oh, you don't have to wear it.  Is it brand new?  It's never been worn.  Oh, maybe he'll wear it.  That'd be nice.  Maybe he will wear it.  A chemical warfare outfit, just in case I need... 
[03:04:30]  Charcoal lined.  He'll wear that in his own house when he has Jewish neighbors over.  Fucking creep.  And here are the pants.  Damn.  It's got the hood.  I'm sure you've got your own gas mask.  Who doesn't?  Exactly.  You never know when that race war is going to start.  She's never going to fit in that.  It's supposed to be big on you.  It's supposed to be big.  It's going to look like a tent on him.  Yeah, well, it's not a fashion statement.  That is very, very nice.  Very thoughtful.  Yeah.  Thinking into my psychoses. 
[03:05:00]  Exactly.  Now, you can keep the bag, throw it, burn it, sell it on eBay.  Yeah, I'll keep that, but not the bag.  Not a problem.  Kenny, if you would, in the office, well, after, you know, afterwards, and put it with  the rest of my war stuff.  Exactly.  I should wear that on a plane today.  Hopefully next to some of the...  Oh, that'll be good.  Hopefully next to some of your Nazi memorabilia.  I really hope it would go up next to that.  There's a few things in there.  Now, Jimmy, I've got two things for you.  Oh.  One of them, I hope...  His balls.  ...would make for decent radio.  I know that your tender sentiments box has got to be getting a little low. 
[03:05:30]  We haven't used them in a while.  Well, so this is for you.  Thank you.  Can you tell this, guys, from a new market that we want to make happy?  Yeah.  We want to make a new market happy.  Well, I live in D.C.  I got this in Pittsburgh, but I live just outside of D.C.  Oh, D.C.?  Yeah.  Then go fuck yourself.  Exactly.  They suck.  But you know what?  I love you guys.  That is every fortune I've ever gotten out of a fortune cookie.  Now, why did you save those?  Because I'm stupid. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, why did you save them?  Are you superstitious?  No.  You think if you save them, no.  You just pull up one, you think, oh, okay.  You pull up a few, and then all of a sudden...  You've got to make a conscious decision at one point and say, I'm going to save all my  fortune cookie fortunes.  I'll read these on the air sometime when we're having a slow news day.  No, no, no.  Don't worry.  I know it's retarded.  No, it's not.  I just brought it up just in case.  Now, this next one, I know you're going to like, though.  Gun.  No.  First, we have two tickets to the Yankees game this afternoon. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, thank you.  Next, we have two free hot dogs and Cokes to the Yankees game this afternoon.  Thank you.  And lastly, your own free Yankees...  Actually, I guess one of the other coupons was this.  It's a free Yankees yearbook.  Thank you very much.  Wow.  So...  Who wants to go to the Yankee game?  That's good.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm flying to Houston today.  Nathaniel?  Where are you performing in Houston, Jimmy?  Funny you should ask.  At the improv.  He bought me a plug.  Thank you, though.  What are your dates, Jimmy?  Tonight through Saturday.  I'll try to get there.  I appreciate it. 
[03:07:00]  Thank you anyway, buddy, but I can't use him because I'm going.  Give him to Than.  She'll use him.  I could give him to Than.  We could give him to Club Soda Kenny and Than.  It could be a double.  I'll be on the plane.  Club Soda Kenny can be on the plane with me.  Double.  There you go.  Squeeze into the middle seat.  Think I'm taking the middle seat?  You're fucking out of your mind.  Six-eight.  Are they good seats, at least?  No.  They're in between third base and home plate.  Two rows off the railing.  Upper deck.  Upper deck.  Upper deck.  Have fun.  Yeah, enjoy.  Bring a net.  Here's the rule.  On-air personalities, get third baseline.  Him. 
[03:07:30]  Him.  Upper deck.  Cheap fans.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm kidding, dude.  The only seats I like are the ones that I could actually place my beer on the dugout.  Those are my seats.  I would assume you wouldn't even go to the game.  You'd stay at home and watch it on your big TV.  I do most of the time.  That's why I never am by the dugout with a beer.  Never get those seats.  Damn it.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, thank you very much, gentlemen.  Just wanted to come in and say hi.  You guys are fantastic.  German warfare.  Don't believe the Pittsburgh rumor.  We're on in Pittsburgh.  We're doing well.  Yes, of course.  I don't know who spread that nasty rumor. 
[03:08:00]  Jimmy Norton.  I did.  You made a slow show slower.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you, sir.  Enjoy.  Holy shit.  Speaking of baseball, a 70s baseball blooper.  Who found this, Sam?  Seven.  I cut it up for Sam.  Yeah.  Listener submission.  Listener?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Dick, I definitely started to get it together.  After the fifth, I started to pick my arm up and get my curve and my change up. 
[03:08:30]  I became a pitcher rather than a thrower, and I did make a very vital mistake to grieve.  No business throwing that pitch whatsoever at all.  Right down the cock.  Well, you just didn't want to let him have a chance.  Right down the cock?  Holy shit.  That's a good blooper.  No business throwing that pitch whatsoever at all.  Right down the cock.  Well, you just didn't want to let him have a chance to walk to the first base.  You just reared back and barreled that fastball through there, huh?  Yeah.  Right. 
[03:09:00]  The little drama between you and Jeff Burrow.  Don't let Ted Bosfield get you all broken up there.  I know you're excited over winning this first one in 1974.  He's not going to acknowledge that he just said cock.  It's 1974?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're not acknowledging that.  Jeff Burrow.  Now, don't let Ted Bosfield get you all broken up there.  I know you're excited over winning this first one in 1974.  Hey, we got it together.  It's all right down here.  I'll tell you one thing.  You left-handers have your own way of speaking our language. 
[03:09:30]  And we're going to get you back in the clubhouse before we get in trouble.  Thank you for being our guest, and congratulations.  Right down the cock.  That's pretty good.  This guy handled it well, though.  He didn't freak out.  No.  Like nowadays, forget about it.  The guy would be freaking out.  Oh, we'd like to apologize to everybody out there.  Yeah, jumping out of his seat like that guy.  I watched that clip like 80 times of that news guy.  He's out of his seat, stunned.  I think it's up on opiananthony.com, the video now. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, check it out.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take another break.  We'll regroup, and we'll continue.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  . 
[03:10:30]  .  .  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James Brown. 
[03:11:00]  I don't want to play it. 
[03:11:30]  I don't want to play it. 
[03:12:00]  I don't want to play it. 
[03:12:30]  I don't want to play it.  A couple more things to do today, and then we're out of here.  I don't want to play it.  Things.  Things.  A couple of things. 
[03:13:00]  The eye in the sky at Caesars Hotel looking at more than just the chips.  The state's casino commission says four men operating security cams there were zooming in on women back in 2004.  They've all been fired.  Yesterday, the state casino board suspended the license of one of the supervisors.  For about 20 days, Caesars has paid $185,000 in fines.  Of course they were spying on hot women.  Yeah.  That job's got to be so boring.  How many people are actually trying to cheat the casino out of money? 
[03:13:30]  What do you think?  On an hour-to-hour basis?  Probably not that many.  But how many big-headed bimbos are sitting down in a chair and you zoom in on their cleavage?  I mean, the dealer, you know, you remove your cards from the table, they're yelling and screaming at you.  Yeah.  They're already on top of the situation.  These guys are like falling asleep on the jobs.  They see a piece of ass, they're zooming in.  Yeah, it's very rare that they get those clips you see on the cop shows, which I love, by the way.  Nothing better than watching the guy at the casino kind of, and they go, look, he's looking, looking. 
[03:14:00]  And now the distraction and the old woman at the slot machine looks to one side and someone else walking by, boom, grabs that little bucket of change and just keeps going.  And then you see the cops come over in the big ruckus.  Nothing better than a casino ruckus caught on tape.  You know, the bad mustache and, like, shorts and no socks and a mullet being wrestled to the ground?  The casinos are way too big.  I mean, where are you running?  There's no way.  You're never out of there.  Has there ever been anybody that's tried to steal from a casino and actually made it out the door? 
[03:14:30]  I don't know.  Ocean's Eleven.  Well, yeah, okay.  That was a good one.  They got away with a lot of stuff.  They take it to the back room, though, and then they threaten you with a saw.  The cooler?  Saw your hand off.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How's it going today?  All righty.  Hey there.  All right.  Nice.  I just wanted to bring up Ron and Fez.  I know it's a dead subject, but if you guys listen to it, the pests were nailing them  so bad that Ronnie had to actually jump on board and started setting up Fezzy just to 
[03:15:00]  Ramon him all day long.  It was fucking hysterical.  What do you mean Ron was doing it?  Seriously.  I mean, Ron was getting so disturbed by it that he would just start tuning in.  He'd set up Fez and go, listen, I know we don't want to talk about it.  And then all of a sudden, if Fez would jump on board and start believing what he was saying,  he hit him with the, Ramon, Fez is sucking hog.  You know, just all of a sudden.  Ron was Ramon and Fez.  He was Ramon.  He fell for it each time. 
[03:15:30]  Seems like Ron's being smart in this whole thing and saving his own ass.  Every man for himself.  Ron knows.  Ron knows.  It was good shizzle.  You know, it was really good stuff to watch.  Yeah, Ron knows, though, in the end.  He's saving his own ass.  When the shit goes down, he knows he still has a show.  All right.  Good.  Thank you, Jim.  Take care.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, this is Joe from Georgia.  What's up, Joe? 
[03:16:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, I just wanted to find out if you guys heard the clip from Nesson.  Last night during the Red Sox game with Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark.  Now, what happened, dude?  It sounds interesting.  Oh, my God.  They were, I heard it on ESPN radio.  Oh, man.  They were in Mel Gibson and telling them, you know, Euclid is a Jew.  And that's, you know, we've got a Jew on our team.  And then we've got another one in Kapler. 
[03:16:30]  And it was just probably the 30th seconds of the funniest TV I've ever heard.  Oh, really?  Wait, so they were in the broadcast booth or?  Yeah, I think they were in the broadcast booth.  And whoever does the play-by-play was there with them.  Yeah.  And just laughing hysterically.  Couldn't catch his breath.  So what was Gibson saying during this?  I thought he was in rehab.  No, no, no.  It was Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark.  Oh. 
[03:17:00]  Hammering Mel Gibson, in a sense, for the fact that we've got two Jewish players on the Red Sox team.  Yeah, there are two Jewish players on the Red Sox team.  Who said there weren't?  Well, no.  No, they weren't.  I'm a little confused.  You've got to explain a little better.  You're not making sense, brother.  Okay.  Dennis Leary, Lenny Clark, they were at the Red Sox game.  They were in the broadcast booth.  And Mel Gibson was there, and what did he say?  Yeah, he's being controversial?  No, Mel Gibson wasn't there.  They were just hammering the fans. 
[03:17:30]  So who were they talking to?  Wait, if Mel Gibson wasn't there, how did Mel Gibson come up?  Right, right, right.  Well, they were talking about Kevin Eucliss and the fact that I guess he's Jewish.  Dude, no, no.  Mel Gibson was not talking about Kevin Eucliss.  He was saying the Jews in general.  He never named anybody.  He never was specific.  He was simply saying the Jews in general.  He wasn't naming Eucliss.  Not any Jews in particular, yeah.  Right.  And then Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark were hammering on the fact. 
[03:18:00]  They said, hey, how about that, Mel?  We've got one Jew on our team.  And then Lenny piped in, well, you know, what about Kapler?  And he said, hey, that's two of them.  How's that?  And also the fact that I guess Mel Gibson's father is denying the Holocaust.  Mel's a Sox fan?  Wait, Dennis Leary was saying that Mel Gibson's father was denying the Holocaust during a Red  Sox game.  Why would he do that?  Why would he bring up the stupid Holocaust, dude?  How old is his father, too?  And he's a Red Sox fan?  That's odd.  No. 
[03:18:30]  So, by the way, where does the funny part come in?  Yeah, I'm not sure what you're saying, brother.  It was just them commenting on Mel Gibson's little plight with the police in Malibu.  Yeah, but you're saying that Mel Gibson was trashing Jews and named Kevin Eucliss specifically,  but he didn't.  No, I didn't say that.  What did you say again?  That's exactly what you said.  We'll play the tape back, dude.  That's what I thought I heard.  What I meant to say, if I did, and I apologize, was that Dennis Leary and Lenny Clark were 
[03:19:00]  commenting on what Mel Gibson had said about Jews, and they were throwing around the comment  or throwing around the fact that we've got two Jewish players on a Red Sox team, and basically  saying, how do you like that, Mel, and going off on it.  But if you talk to Dennis, ask him about it.  It was great.  All right, can you sum this whole thing up?  What was the funniest part that Dennis Leary, you know, what he said?  What was the funniest part?  Probably the funniest part. 
[03:19:30]  Wow.  Oh, God.  Shut up.  Holy shit.  Krista.  We played that audio, didn't we?  Of course.  We just played it.  Krista, what's up?  Hey, I apparently tuned in late, and I was trying to figure out what happened on Ron and  Fez, and your call screener sent me to you because he didn't want to answer the question.  Yes, whatever.  Well, we're not allowed to talk about it on the air.  It's in human resources hands, but Ronnie's doing the right thing, it seems, with Fezzy. 
[03:20:00]  And if you've just listened to their show yesterday, you'll hear Fez actually refers  to himself as gregarious.  All right.  And it sounds like, I was listening yesterday because I want to make sure, you know, we  don't have the same problem, and they were smart to keep it off the air for the most  part, but you can tell that Ron is distancing himself from Fez at this point.  No matter what happens, I think Ron will be fine.  Right, and vice versa, though.  But, you know.  So, Ron's worked with other people before anyway, hasn't he? 
[03:20:30]  Throughout the years?  Yeah, it'll all come out soon.  But we've got to wait for human resources and what they think about the whole thing.  Okay.  So, I don't know what to tell you.  Some people just tend to be, you know, we're a little too big for their britches and start  interpreting things that are happening around the office as different, and it makes it uncomfortable  for everybody involved.  And we're very, very disappointed, I've got to tell you. 
[03:21:00]  Very disappointed.  So, if they want to talk about it more, you know, so be it.  Let them talk away.  Fair enough.  Thanks.  Do you have a...  Have a good day.  But do you have any comment on that?  No, not really.  What's your take?  What's my take?  I have no idea.  Do you like those guys?  Huh?  Not really.  Hey, we said we would settle it on there, but, you know, they ran to human resources 
[03:21:30]  first, so fine.  We'll play that way then if we have to.  Don't say they, really.  Yeah.  Well, we know what we mean by they, but I have to be, you know, safe here and say they.  That's what they're telling me.  Ronnie man's up.  It's they for now on.  And now all of a sudden Fez is gregarious.  Gregarious?  Yeah, he calls himself gregarious.  Ask him, he'll tell you.  Right.  He loves saying that.  All right, Krista.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, get home safe.  Godspeed.  It's a sad day.  It's a sad day. 
[03:22:00]  Bye.  All right, let's go to the lady trucker.  Lady trucker, what's up?  Hey, to that fucking idiot from Georgia.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, God, I can run you all by me.  Wait, you're so mad at him that you had to beep your horn?  And run someone off the road?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I apologize for the person I hit.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  All right, lady trucker.  That was terrific, too.  Thank you. 
[03:22:30]  Thank you.  Country Western singer Troy Lee Gentry  faces federal prison  after allegedly killing a tamed bear.  Gentry of the country music group Montgomery Gentry  is charged with illegally killing a black bear  in a pen in Minnesota.  This video is of a similar black bear.  Gentry appeared Tuesday in federal court in Minnesota.  Prosecutors believe Gentry bought the bear  and then videotaped himself killing it. 
[03:23:00]  They also believe he used a bow and arrow  to kill the bear in a pen on private property.  What a fucking asshole.  He's all man.  What a fucking asshole.  You're going to hunt a bear.  Get out there.  Got to feel like a man.  Fuck your wife better.  Shark off, fucking hillbilly.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  Tim.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Tim.  Hey, love the show, guys.  You're doing a great job. 
[03:23:30]  Thank you, Tim.  But I got to call you out on something here.  Yeah.  Nothing's going on with Ron and Fats.  I don't know.  You guys are just making this up.  All right.  Wait and see.  Okay.  It's in human resources.  Opie.  Opie, you're being a silly goose.  Well, watch the language.  All right.  Wait and see.  Dude, what are we going to do?  I mean, there's certain things that happen, you know.  Just when you think you know the show, you know. 
[03:24:00]  It takes a nice little twist and turn, right.  Right, right.  You guys got nothing now, don't you?  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  We have nothing on what?  What are you talking about?  I'm just saying.  Nothing's going on with Ron and Fats.  You guys are just kind of.  It's one of your bits, Opie.  I'm going to go before I crash.  Punch it out.  All right.  Believe what you want there, buddy.  Yeah, whatever.  It's a bit.  All right.  So that's it.  On Troy Lee. 
[03:24:30]  Troy Lee killing a bear.  In a cage.  According to the indictment unsealed this week, let's see.  Gentry paid $4,650 to shoot the trophy caliber bear named Cubby at the Minnesota Wildlife Connection  in northern Minnesota, which advertises itself as a place where animals can be photographed  in the wild.  So it's like some kind of a little reserve.  Or sanctuary, a place where little animals are kept. 
[03:25:00]  He used a bow and arrow to kill the animal inside its pen.  A gun probably would have been too loud.  That's why this cocksucker did that.  And that bear was dying and he kept saying, I have to update my website.  A videotape was edited to make it appear that Gentry had hunted down the bear.  That's great.  What a fucking asshole.  What a fucking asshole.  This shoots a tame bear in a cage.  God, I fucking hate hunters. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, all of you.  I don't think Ted Nugent would appreciate your...  Ted Nugent is...  He's why I don't dislike Ted Nugent.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Uncle Ted.  We'll take charge.  Thank you very much.  I'll use it back.  We know, Ted.  You have all the facts, don't you?  Well, we don't all have fucking songs from 30 years ago that made us millionaires that  we can buy our own 80 acres to fucking hunt on.  Sorry, Uncle Ted.  Hey, Ted, but aren't those cop killers...  Well, you would think that because you're a red city liberal.  Let Uncle Ted straighten you right out.  Criminals don't have guns, only that's... 
[03:26:00]  All right, thanks, Ted.  Red, white, and blue.  We're sure you're all American.  Thanks.  Godspeed, Ted.  Get home safe.  Appreciate that.  It is a treat to get that with him.  That little boy was sick.  That fucking kid make a wish.  He went to kill a bear.  Right, that was his dream.  Ah, fuck him.  How about putting a bear hat on yourself and blowing your own brains out?  You fucking got 10 minutes left anyway.  It's food, thank you very much.  Yeah, I don't mind if Nugent...  The reason I don't mind Nugent is because I think he really hunts because he hates the  way...  He eats everything he hunts. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  If you eat what you hunt, I don't have a problem with it.  I really don't.  Goes to the shelters with the meat and gives, like, the hungry...  There's a difference.  It's not just machismo.  There is something constructive being done with it.  But these guys that just hunt so they can fucking hang it and have a bearskin rug to  show that fucking dumb cunt they married, it drives me nuts.  Fucking hate it.  What if you eat it and then just because, you know, the fur is there, you use it to make  a rug or a big stuffed bear in the corner of your house? 
[03:27:00]  That's fine.  It's just kind of annoying to me.  Yeah.  Why do you eat that?  Why?  Have a live bear in there if you got any fucking balls.  Imagine you come home and you have to fight off a bear every day.  Yeah, stand that up and you're living with much of shit on your throw pillows.  I went hunting once, speaking of bears and fur.  Yeah?  You did?  Yeah, I was hunting and when I was in the woods, there was a bear and a rabbit taking a shit  side by side and the bear said to the rabbit, do you have trouble with shit sticking to  your fur?  And the rabbit said no.  So the bear wiped his ass with it. 
[03:27:30]  Wow.  Because now he doesn't have trouble with the shit on the fur.  Maybe you could shoot a bear and use his knee bone as a chin.  I just, um, I guess everybody's going to be leaving soon for vacation.  You ever shoot a bear in your pajamas?  No.  What would he have been doing in your pajamas? 
[03:28:00]  Jesus.  Only Kenny wouldn't enjoy that.  He's just laughing because he's thinking of it being a black bear.  He loves the simple ones.  All right.  Me and Jimmy are going to be leaving for Houston, so I'm not going to see you guys.  So I want to wish you, like, a safe trip and a nice vacation.  Thank you. 
[03:28:30]  Everything was hooked up.  I like how you arranged everything, all my transportation.  Kenny, you're a saint.  Thank you.  You're a saint.  And then I'll pick you up on Friday and we're going to do our thing Saturday at the PNC.  Looking forward to it.  Yeah, we can't promote the show because we're going to be gone.  We heading down Friday?  No, I'm picking up Mr. Anthony at the airport.  Yes.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  I'm bringing him up because I'm going to stay kind of, you know, close.  I'm not coming back home.  That's smart.  Because when you get to Newark Airport during rush hour on a Friday, the thought of driving 
[03:29:00]  out to Long Island, not really, you know, let's tack another three hours onto the drive.  It can be heck.  Let's say hi to Dave in Michigan.  Dave.  Watch your mouth.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What's wrong with runners?  Dude, look, it just bugs me because there's such a, again, guys that like use everything  and eat everything I don't have a problem with, but there's just such a fucking, but just a 
[03:29:30]  bunch of beer drinking idiots most of them are and it's annoying to me that they have  to just go out and shoot something that's not bothering them.  I'd respect them more if they did it with their bare fucking hands or if they walked  up and just attacked somebody in the street, a guy that can fight back.  Some dumb animal.  They can't do anything.  Huh?  I'm hunting for fur this weekend, Jimmy.  You know where I'm hunting?  What?  The Houston Improv.  You're a good boy.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Jake the Snake.  And if, by the way, one person calls and says deer overpopulation, I'm going to fucking 
[03:30:00]  shit in your open mouth.  Thanks, Uncle Ted.  Well, if it wasn't for me, there'd be deers on the highway driving and talking and running  for office.  Running for office.  Jake the Snake, what's up?  Hey, we're here at ronfez.net.  We've started a collaboration and if Fezzy or Ron or anybody gets off of XM because of  you, Opie, we're all going to cancel and we're going to let Eric Logan know why.  Don't always blame me.  Don't always blame me.  Apparently it has nothing to do with Anthony and he's a pretty stand-up guy.  Don't always blame me, friend. 
[03:30:30]  You don't have the guts to cancel.  Yeah.  I certainly do.  No, you don't.  All right.  I only sit through this show and listen to Ron and Fez.  No, you don't.  It's a much better show.  No, you don't.  You're lying.  Good for you.  You're lying, dude.  I dare you to cancel.  We'll take another break and we'll continue in...  I might be gone, so bye to everyone.  No.  It's 10.30, right?  Yes.  It's 10...  No, it's 9.30.  Okay.  What the hell's going on? 
[03:31:00]  We're the Opie and Anthony Show.  Awful. 
[03:31:30]  Awful.  Awful.  They're just awful.  Awful people.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  Jim Norton's up off to the airport, flying to Houston for the improv.  He's got shows all weekend long.  Sitting up like that.  I was leaning back in my chair and I love when you just sit up and...  Ow.  Like this pain. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, you got a kink?  Like, oh, isn't that great?  What happened when you were a kid and you could run like 30 miles an hour into a brick wall  and just laugh it off?  What happened?  Not anymore.  Seems like only yesterday.  We got one more show tomorrow before we go on vacation.  Do we?  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill is sitting in for Jimmy tomorrow.  We also have...  We have a lot of things going on tomorrow.  We got Drew Boogie coming in, spinning.  He's going to spin.  He's actually spinning at the PNC show as well on August 26th. 
[03:32:30]  Very good.  He should have been spinning right from the start there.  Up there in Worcester.  Yeah, but he'll be at the PNC show spinning in between the comics and stuff.  That's going to be great.  We're kind of bummed.  We're, what, nine days out.  We can only promote the show one more day and then all next week, which is, like, really  important when you're trying to push a show.  We're not going to be on the air to push it.  So, I don't know.  Maybe you guys can help us out a little bit and spread the word that it's right around  the corner if you're in the New York, New Jersey, Philly area.  Could be running promos. 
[03:33:00]  I think so, yeah.  Could be promos.  I think we're going to be running promos, giving away tickets next week as we're in  worst of mode.  So, that's going to be very exciting.  All the info is up on opieandanthony.com.  I think people know that by now.  I hope they do.  So, Patrice O'Neal tomorrow.  Drew Boogie.  And Patty wants to do the news tomorrow?  Ugh.  Stark and Patty wants to do the news tomorrow as well on the show.  I want to do the news.  So, there you go.  I can't wait for a take on Jumpin' at Ramsey.  Jumpin' at. 
[03:33:30]  I can't wait for the latest info to come out.  There's going to be more info by tomorrow.  This guy is a creep.  Just a ghoul.  Just a ghoul.  He was in love with our...  He's, like, talking about how he, like, they had a relationship kind of love.  Six-year-old.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Well, I want to know, uh, what's the relationship with the parents?  Something still doesn't make sense there.  But it looks like it's all going to come to light now, now that they got the guy.  It's a whole nationwide thing, because they apparently lived close to each other in Georgia 
[03:34:00]  before the Ramseys moved to Colorado.  Do you think this sick fuck followed him to Colorado, because of the little...  Seems to be.  ...the little girl?  How old was, uh, how old was she in Georgia?  I don't know.  Couldn't have been that old if she was six when she died.  Right, right.  So, you know, uh, he just always was, uh, gawking over her, I guess, as a...  That's what he said in, uh, part of his little confession, is that she was very cute and sweet,  and he loved her, and it was an accident.  He was trying a kidnapping, and, uh, he accidentally, um, choked her during a kidnapping, 
[03:34:30]  which I believe right there is the death penalty.  I don't know.  Do they do that anymore?  No.  And automatically, if you're a kid, if somebody dies during a kidnapping attempt, you give  them the death penalty?  No.  Federal?  No, no.  Uh, he lived 30 miles away from the Ramseys in Georgia, 41 years old, ex, uh, school teacher,  father of three boys.  There's all the, uh, the facts, the fact sheet.  And he should go to prison for wearing that outfit. 
[03:35:00]  Wearing, oh my God.  His pants are almost up to his chest.  And he's wearing this buttoned shirt with a collar where the top button is buttoned.  Yeah.  He just looks creepy.  Well, we'll see what happens with that, so.  Robert in, uh, Ohio, what's up?  Hi there, guys.  Love the show.  Hey there, Babby.  Anyone call you Bobby?  Oh, yeah, when I was younger.  I hate that.  When people call me that.  Is, uh, yeah, what's your name? 
[03:35:30]  Uh, Anthony Cumia.  And then they go, uh, call you Tony?  No, if my name was fucking Tony, I'd have said my name is Tony Cumia.  It's Anthony.  That's the problem with having a name that has a couple different derivatives.  Right.  One.  Um, my wife's a recent convert to your show, and God love her for it.  Another reason I love her, but she recently proudly proclaimed herself a pest in training  after the whole Tyra Banks debacle, and she has seen the show a couple times, and it's 
[03:36:00]  horrific.  But the thing about her fear of dolphins, my wife decided to buy a stuffed dolphin and  mail it to the show, and she signed it with love from Raboon.  Oh, really?  She actually got a letter from Tyra.  I'm sure it was from a staffer, but it was thanking her and saying Tyra loved animals  and all that, so, I mean, both the show is stupid, and obviously her staffers are, too,  by missing the point.  But I was proud of my wife.  I mean, it's baby steps for us here in Ohio becoming pests. 
[03:36:30]  Right.  Hey, before you know it, it'll be severed dolphin heads, real ones.  That's right.  Hey, are you close to Cleveland?  Yes, and I have tickets, and I cannot wait for you guys.  You guys are the best, and I just, I mean, the thing I love most about your show is the  honesty, and I mean that sincerely.  In this day and age, it's hard to find a lot of entertainers who are honest, and you guys  are, so I thank you guys for that.  Love you all.  Love little Jimmy.  Hope he's going to have a safe trip, and you guys have a great vacation.  Thank you, Robert. 
[03:37:00]  We appreciate that.  Yeah, we try to bring the honesty as much as we can.  Tony in Missouri, what's up?  Hey, I was listening to CNN last night, and they had an interview with JonBenet's dad,  and he said he didn't know this guy from Adam.  Oh, yeah?  Never met him?  Yeah.  Never met him.  Well, how did he get into the house and the basement and all that?  Eh, break in.  It was just a break in, and was he admiring?  Maybe he was admiring from afar.  From afar, and then followed, how did, come on. 
[03:37:30]  And then follows them to Colorado, something is up.  The guy moved from Georgia to California, though, for a while.  He lived where Polly Class lived.  Yeah.  That girl that was murdered.  He had a fixation with child murders and child rapes and stuff.  So, I don't know.  If he had seen JonBenet before that, he might have found out where they went, had some kind  of fixation with her, and decided to grab her up and couldn't wait to get her out of 
[03:38:00]  the house before he had any sex with her, I guess.  And who didn't think the mom had something to do with this?  She's not dead from the cancer.  Yeah.  Everyone thought she had something to do with this.  The mom and the dad.  Look at, they should be arrested, though, because look at the way they dressed her.  I'm looking right now at some clip.  It's little JonBenet in a fucking Vegas stripper suit.  They dressed these kids up like little whores.  I don't even, eh, whatever.  Whatever.  Allow everything.  What the fuck? 
[03:38:30]  Oh, I say allow it.  I don't care.  But, I mean, you know.  I certainly wouldn't be parading a kid like that around in those clothes.  Yeah.  You get somebody like this creep after a...  Tony in Connecticut, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  First time caller.  Hey there, Anthony.  How you doing?  Good.  I'd like to add something about that JonBenet case that you did not talk about.  Yeah.  There's no way that this could have been an accident, because also one of the problems  with her was her skull was caved in from the back of her skull to just above the left 
[03:39:00]  eyebrow, and they said it was something like a heavy flashlight had done this.  And they said that's a blow that more than likely killed her.  Yeah, there's no way that this could have been an accident.  There's sick fucking autopsy photos of her up on the web.  You saw them?  Oh, yeah.  You know me with the old dead thing.  I don't like those at all.  It was pretty gruesome.  Where was it? 
[03:39:30]  On Ogrish?  Yeah, one of those.  What is it called?  Ogrish?  Ogrish.  Ogrish.com?  But there are a bunch of other sites, too.  Whatever it is.  I'm really twisted.  A lot of people ask, where's your edge?  It comes to that website, man.  That website is rough.  Can't go there.  Freaking Ben used to watch the beheadings like it was...  Oh, like cartoons.  Like it was cartoons every day after the show.  That, dude.  Over and over again.  I'm like, hold.  Ben, stop.  Let's go to Jim in Jersey.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  What are you doing?  I was watching TV last night, and I saw your promo for the PNC Bank Art Center show. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, cool.  The only problem was is at 2 a.m.  Well, we didn't have a big budget to advertise the comedy show.  What channel was it on?  I think it was Channel 4, because I was watching like Conan O'Brien from like a week and a half ago.  So up all night at NBC.  Yeah, they bought time on Conan O'Brien and, I don't know, Late Night Comedy Central.  We didn't have much of a budget.  It wasn't bad, but it was just your cartoon caricatures bobbing their heads back the entire 30 seconds. 
[03:40:30]  First of all, can we get rid of those fucking cartoon caricatures already?  We're trying.  Enough is enough with those.  There was something recently.  They're like, use your cartoon caricatures.  I'm like, no.  Just use anything.  Billboards.  They wanted billboards in a new market.  I think, was it Pittsburgh?  Where the hell was it?  Philly?  I don't remember.  West Palm?  I don't know.  Just pick a city.  But, yeah, they wanted to use the cartoon caricatures and were like, enough. 
[03:41:00]  Enough of those stupid cartoon caricatures.  Myself and all five other people watching TV at that time saw it at 2 a.m.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey there, Rob.  Yeah, I wanted to say you guys really chose convenient dates for me for this traveling  virus.  The 26th is when I'm getting married.  The third.  You could just leave everything out after that, sir, because now that you're married,  you can't do shit.  So you're getting married, and then anything you want to see, do, be with after that, yeah, 
[03:41:30]  just write it off.  Well, she has no problem.  She actually even said we're getting married early in the morning.  We're not doing a night wedding.  We're doing an early ceremony.  She told you that, right?  You know, if you want, well, yeah, that's what she said.  She's like, if you want, we could try to make it to the show.  I'm like, yeah, I don't think that's going to really work out.  I guess she was just trying to make me feel better, but, so I guess the next show, the  next tour that you guys do, I'll try to definitely be there.  It sucks that.  The first one you did in Boston, I was on. 
[03:42:00]  All right, all right, all right.  No one cares.  Listen, I'm going to try to help you out here.  Holy shit.  Goodbye, goodbye.  No, no, hold on.  Don't hang up.  He bailed out.  I was going to give him tickets.  That guy is so, he's pussy wet before he's married.  Because he said September 3rd is a problem, but the show is September 9th.  It's in Philly.  That's not a bad ride to go see the show.  He's screwed up.  Will you call back, Rob?  Ask your wife to be if you can call us back.  If you're available September 9th, the Camden Show, Camden, New Jersey, Tweeter Center for  Philadelphia, right across the river there, we'll give you a pair of tickets. 
[03:42:30]  It's not that bad of a ride from Long Island.  I've done it in like two and a half hours, I think.  Maybe three with a little traffic.  Let's see.  What?  Nick in Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Once you know, it's September 23rd, too, just real quick.  In Cleveland, I'm turning on Buckeye's Penn State tickets to go to the Traveling Virus  show.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you. 
[03:43:00]  I try.  But, yeah, the one clip you guys play all the time, not the Brad Pitt from Seven, but  the, you're a liar, is the clip from South Park.  Yeah.  Where Futter's dad is screaming at John Bonnet and John Bonnet's parents.  So I just kind of thought it was ironic now that, you know, that's the case.  Yeah, they're not liars.  Yeah.  Well, we don't know yet.  Everything's alleged.  I want to get all the info today.  Hopefully, a lot of the info will be released.  But there's got to be some kind of bizarre connection.  Let's say hi to Andrew on Long Island.  Andrew. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, what's up, Obi and Anthony?  Hey.  You guys rock, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  I want to tell you guys.  I saw your ad at 7 o'clock on Comedy Central at night.  Yeah?  I don't know what that last call was talking about.  At 2 a.m.  Well, God bless you there, Andy.  Well, that's...  They call you Andy?  No, I prefer Andrew.  All right, Andy.  Not Tony.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You know, this is getting back at everybody from my childhood.  The commercial for the O&A traveling virus with the cartoon character is very nice.  Thank you, Pete. 
[03:44:00]  You know, whatever.  Absolutely.  It's selling tickets for the comedy show, and we couldn't be happier.  August 26, PNC.  But we can't wait for the Opie and Anthony commercial to hit New York, the real one.  The TV commercial for our show that we do on FM radio.  Where we're actually moving and attempting to act.  It's live action.  It's not a bobbling freaking cartoon head for 30 seconds.  It's professionally filmed, directed, written, and acted by Opie and Anthony. 
[03:44:30]  Master thespians.  I think we came up with a really nice concept.  Yes.  They belong on the radio.  I think, in general, people like the TV spot.  I found myself on the message board last night explaining, like, why I was doing the line I was doing.  And I felt like one of those idiots that I always goof on.  Well, see, he's more of a dummy than he is being mean.  See, my character, I learned so much from him during that shooting. 
[03:45:00]  See, we're supposed to be clueless at this job.  Yeah, it's not like a mean thing.  It's not us as radio personalities.  It's us, clueless, trying to do another job.  And then you get a little taste of our personality.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people said...  We follow direction very well.  The director explained it specifically like that.  It's like, you guys, if you weren't on the radio, you would be doing something else.  We're going to put you in this situation.  We don't want your actual radio personalities.  No.  Because that's not believable at all. 
[03:45:30]  No one would hire you.  Right.  So it's like you did get hired, but you can't do the job.  Some guy typed, you know, because they only saw the one version of me delivering the line.  There's two 30s, there's two 15s, and then eventually we're going to be releasing bloopers.  They want to do it slowly but surely, by the way.  There was the one of me delivering the line to the girl about her fat ass.  And someone typed, you know, I just think Opie should have delivered that line because he's  more of the, you know, ass of the show and more of the prick to people that walk in and 
[03:46:00]  stuff.  And it's like, no, that isn't what it was about.  And there are other versions where Opie does deliver the punch line.  But the whole thing is, it's not being nasty or mean.  I'm so clueless in it that we shouldn't be doing anything but radio because we are that  clueless.  The line was delivered that way, like very deadpan.  And, you know, I just don't understand how you're supposed to deal with real humans in  real life.  Right, right.  But it's not supposed to be a mean thing. 
[03:46:30]  Right.  If it was mean, obviously it would be Opie.  But we're happy with how it came out.  The company that made the spot, they said it's one of the top three spots they've ever  done.  Yeah, it was done very well.  It was, it looks great.  Nice widescreen.  I got to tell you, Anthony and I have been doing radio since 94-ish, summer of 94, 12 years.  12 years.  12 years.  And we finally get our first official Opie and Anthony commercial.  Real commercial.  No offense to XAM because they throw us in their spots now finally. 
[03:47:00]  But this is like a commercial.  It's all about the show.  Powerpoint presentation.  We're attempting to act.  To be real.  And we're doing our thing.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  All of a sudden you see our heads for two seconds.  Yeah.  And then they call us up.  You see it?  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  We appreciate it.  So Derek Jeter and I saw Bob Dylan.  And I think I saw me in between there somewhere.  Oh, yeah.  We went by as fast as the NASCAR cars.  Didn't even say our name.  It's like in comedy.  Right.  Outrageous comedy.  I know.  And then our logo and our faces real fast. 
[03:47:30]  But I got to tell you, we're really, really excited.  It's the first time.  Yeah.  The first time we actually got a commercial.  We never had billboards before or bus signs.  So it's very exciting for us.  It's always just been, hey, here, guys.  Here's some mics.  Go do your shit yourself.  Infinity Broadcasting, when they did re-sign us, they did give us a wow billboard in Times Square for like a week.  That was really cool.  And then XM did give us the huge banner hanging off Madison Square Garden.  Yeah, it was cool.  But as far as like just an all-out marketing campaign, it's really exciting. 
[03:48:00]  You know, we're really psyched.  You know, it's been a long time coming.  Wanted to be on the TV.  So we're in the subways.  We're on the buses.  And now we've got this nice TV commercial.  And we're very proud of it.  We're very happy with it.  You guys should check it out.  It's only airing in West Palm so far?  As far as I know.  I didn't even know it was going to air in West Palm first.  But, yeah, it's airing there.  And then from talking to Tom Chiasano over there at Free FM here in New York, he said soon here. 
[03:48:30]  Probably next week.  Probably next week.  Oh, next week now?  Probably when we're on vacation is going to hit.  Ah, there you go.  Let us know where it's airing.  And let us know what version it's airing, too.  Because there's a couple different ones there.  And then some stations are just going to run the quick 10, 15-second spots.  The commercial is up on YouTube.  Search Opie and Anthony.  I'm obsessed with YouTube.  I said it earlier this morning.  It's fun what pops up out of nowhere.  And, of course, the commercial is also on OpieandAnthony.com and all the other fan sites. 
[03:49:00]  But we're very, very happy with the commercial.  And we hope we get to do a few more.  We've got a couple more ideas with that tagline, they belong on the radio.  It was fun and exciting.  Pedro, what's up?  Pedro.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  I think I'm going to build her a cake.  Yes, sir.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to let you know last night at 10 o'clock during South Park, your commercial  was on twice.  The one with the cartoons?  Yeah, the one with the cartoons.  The P&P show. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're getting confused.  There's a commercial running with our cartoon characters that just kind of bobs on the screen  for 30 seconds.  And it talks about the Opie and Anthony comedy tour, the ONA traveling virus.  And then there's going to be a commercial hitting any day now where it's Ant and I as  our, well, not, well, we're playing a part, but it's us in the commercial acting or trying  to act.  Acting.  With a big fat girl.  Well, as soon as I see that, I'll give you guys a call and let you know when it came on.  All right.  And, yeah, the commercial's up on opiananthony.com. 
[03:50:00]  And then the other thing that's really, really exciting, two weeks from today, we're going  to be on David Letterman.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's huge.  A little nervous about that one?  It's a little scary.  Honestly, I'm not, if it's done right, it's going to be a piece of cake.  Yeah.  If it's done right.  That's why I think we needed, you know, to talk to the writers and the people over at  Letterman.  Because if he just, if he does kind of like a laundry list of our careers, knowing David 
[03:50:30]  Letterman's personality, he'd have a lot of fun with that.  Yeah.  We could just talk about how we've gotten in trouble over the course of our career.  Kind of like a winged interview, it could go either way.  Yeah.  If we get to talk about ourselves and what we've done with the radio show, it's so easy.  So easy.  But if it's the other way, then I'm going to be nervous.  You know?  Things we've gotten fired for.  The voyeur bus.  Sex for Sam.  The mayor's prank.  Yeah.  I mean, it goes on and on.  We do a little recap for the people that don't know us. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  And they could see us and go, who the hell are these guys?  And then we kind of go, we talk about what we've done and people go, oh, wow.  I'm sure he's going to want to talk about Howard.  Yeah.  That's easy though.  We could do that in our sleep.  Yeah.  That stuff is really easy.  So, you know, we'll see what happens.  We're going to hopefully meet with them as soon as we get back and figure that out.  But that's beyond exciting for us too, man.  Yes.  You know, it's an exciting time to be doing this radio show.  Really exciting time. 
[03:51:30]  All right.  We're just babbling because we didn't have anything left to do today.  We're conversing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Will in Minnesota.  Will?  Hello, bu-bu-bu-boy.  What's up, Will?  I got two comments, man.  First of all, JonBenet Ramsey's pathologist, in his report, stated that she had been molested chronically.  So, I mean, up to six months before she was murdered, she was molested. 
[03:52:00]  Second of all, yeah, second of all.  Holy crap, Will.  I hung up on you when I was sitting there on the screen.  You had a call back, right?  Sometimes we just know best.  Hey, hey, I got another one for you.  And you can't take it personally if you're on hold and we hang up on you.  We just know best.  So, I hung up on this guy because I'm like, holy, who cares shit?  And he calls back with the same stuff under the guise he wants to talk about something else.  I got something else for you.  All right. 
[03:52:30]  Well, why don't you just talk about that?  Just get right to the point.  Get right to the point.  We didn't give a shit about the other thing.  Okay.  Okay, your past caller fucking is fucking propping you guys on how honest you guys are.  You guys are fucking, fucking hat fucking horse shit motherfuckers, man.  As bad as Howard.  With this fucking Ron and Fist fucking bitch you got going.  Mm-hmm.  How honest are you guys?  Seriously.  How fucking honest are you?  In what way?  Oh, boy.  What do you mean in what way?  I understand you guys got a bit going and we should all join in.  But don't sit there in one breath and fucking tell us fucking, oh, we need to wait and fucking 
[03:53:00]  find out the fucking, you guys are fucking full of fucking shit, man.  All right.  Believe what you want.  You guys are fucking hacked motherfuckers.  Believe what you want.  Anything else?  Oh, yeah.  Believe, okay.  Keep it going.  You fucking, you fucking hacks, man.  Later.  I'll tell you this much, Will.  You don't know if it's real or not.  You can hear it in your voice.  Yeah.  Yeah, you hear that?  Hacks, right?  Right?  Right?  All right.  We should, uh...  I can't end on that kind of call. 
[03:53:30]  Why?  Why?  Let's go to Kristen in Pennsylvania.  Hi, this is Kristen.  I was wondering if you guys could help me out with something.  Me and my fiance, we've been engaged for four years, and now he's telling me he's not going  to marry me unless he has something to do with you guys.  Can you guys help me out?  Uh, no.  Hold on.  I was talking to Anthony about something.  Say that again?  We were, we were having sign language, and we're like discussing things in sign language. 
[03:54:00]  We have to, we have to deal with something after the show, but, all right, what?  Say that again.  Okay.  Me and my fiance, we've been engaged for four years.  Yeah.  And now he's telling me he won't marry me unless it has something to do with owning.  So, can you guys help me out?  I say you walk.  Yeah.  Good idea.  Walk?  I say you walk.  I know, I love him.  I love him.  Isn't marriage supposed to be based on, like, love and that's it?  It should be based on love, not the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:54:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  But the thing is that he listens to you guys all the time, and you guys can't help me on  it at all.  Well, what do you want us to do?  I don't know.  You guys are smart.  Think of something.  We're really not smart.  Yeah, you are.  He can watch the staff fuck you.  No.  No?  Okay.  You can, you can get, like, naked in studio and we could, uh, do something with a wiffle  ball bat.  Uh, good.  No, I don't think so.  I can't do that.  All right.  I, I, anything else? 
[03:55:00]  I don't want to upset that last caller and, you know, have him accuse us of being hacky  if we do some kind of hacky wedding marriage thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's pretty hacky.  I think you're on your own.  All right.  You're on your own.  All right, no problem.  We'll broadcast an entire show from a limousine as this couple gets married.  Down to, what, uh, Atlantic City?  All right.  We're, uh, we're, we're heading out of here.  We've got a couple meetings.  We're live tomorrow, by the way.  Don't get confused.  We've got Patrice O'Neill sitting in for Jim Norton and, uh, Patty coming in to do the 
[03:55:30]  news and Drew Boogie doing some spinning.  All right.  All tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  Rich in Pennsylvania.  Hey, uh, guys.  I'm, uh, yeah, friends.  I'm fans of both you guys and Ron and Feds.  And apparently you guys were friends for a while.  Yeah.  Can't you guys just, uh, kiss and make up?  Work it out.  You guys both have great shows, different shows, and, uh, I don't want to lose Ron and  Feds, but I like you guys too.  That guy makes a good point.  That's all I got.  That makes a good point.  I guess it'll be up to them. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  It'll be up to them.  Uh, you asked them that question today.  I'll do that.  Have a good, have a good time off, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  And I'll be listening very closely today, Rich.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys.  All righty.  Thanks for listening.  We appreciate it.  Thank you.  Check out opieandanthony.com for some fine, fine videos and the new look.  It's a new website, uh, newly designed by Steve and the boys from foundrymusic.com.  Good job. 
[03:56:30]  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, man.  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn head.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was. </pre>
