<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of *Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol*, spurred by Jim Norton's comparison to *Unstoppable*, focusing on the film's aesthetics and the attractiveness of its actresses, which devolved into explicit sexual commentary.  They also discussed a publicity still of Tom Cruise on the Burj Khalifa, leading to a tangent on videos of dangerous stunts at extreme heights.  Brett Ratner sent greetings, and plans were made to have *Ghost Protocol* guests on the show. A caller, Katie, engaged in a humorous exchange with the hosts about her proximity to the Michigan-Canada border.  This led to a Jerry Sandusky joke, a response from Margie Phelps, and a discussion about a sportsmanship PSA, connecting the "everyone wins" mentality to the Occupy movement. The segment concluded with sexually suggestive impressions using *Planet of the Apes* boxes.

The show then shifted to a discussion about over-competitiveness in youth sports, sparked by a news story about children burning their third-place trophies.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton criticized the parents' reaction, lamenting overprotective parenting and the perceived softening of American society.  Studio guest E-Rock, sporting newly bleached hair, became a focal point, with discussions about the reactions of SiriusXM employees and speculation about his motivations.  Further tangents on parenting styles and sexual preferences ensued.

The broadcast continued with a listener recounting a sexually explicit personal experience involving spanking during oral sex.  This transitioned into a discussion about texting and driving, focusing on potential technological solutions.  The hosts then debated *Time* magazine's "Person of the Year" selections, including controversial choices like Adolf Hitler, often using crude and offensive language. A call from a listener identifying himself as David Berkowitz, son of the "Son of Sam" killer, followed, leading to jokes and banter about his past calls.  A brief segment with Penthouse Pet of the Year Jenna Rose included sexually suggestive comments.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Jenna Rose.  The conversation, highly sexually explicit, covered her career, preferences, and experiences, including detailed discussions of various sexual acts, her nude photoshoots, and past encounters in the adult film industry.  The hosts, along with Chip, Troy, and E-Rock, engaged in suggestive banter and physical interactions with Jenna, including simulated choking and attempts at spanking.  Jenna discussed her early sexual experiences and her background.

The Jenna Rose segments continued with the hosts recounting sexually explicit acts involving vegetables with previous guests, focusing on a photo of Jenna removed from Y-Frog.  Jimmy Norton promoted his comedy shows. Chip called in, adding further sexually explicit commentary about his interaction with Jenna.  The show also discussed Eric Nagel's bleached hair, a homeless man who attacks people (and Opie's videos of these interactions), and concluded with final plugs and goodbyes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  You don't listen to me, you don't listen to me.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, morning people. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Hi.  Hi everyone.  Hi there.  How's everyone doing today?  They're not answering again.  Don't ask them questions, they can't hear you.  They're forgetting. 
[00:01:30]  Jim Norton just arrived?  Yes, Jimmy, he was out in Los Angeles.  I saw Brett Ratner, he says hello.  I'm doing him in a free place.  Hey, Rat.  How you doing?  Good old Brett Ratner.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he still in trouble?  He's doing okay, he seemed okay with it.  You know, he walked through what happened.  He's the Academy Award guy.  Yeah.  He got fucked by the PC police.  Would you get that out of the hamper?  Jimmy was just asking me about Mission Impossible. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Ghost Protocol.  We're going Ghost Protocol.  You know.  Very good?  Yeah, but I'm embarrassed to say this.  I've never seen a Mission Impossible movie before.  And what, they're up to four?  Yeah.  How did that pass me by?  I don't know.  It's been since like the 90s.  I think I've said it a bunch of times on the show.  I'm not an action movie guy in general, but of course I should have seen a Mission Impossible  movie by now.  Somewhere I should have bounced across your transom. 
[00:02:30]  And there's a lot of movies I just see for the radio show and stuff just to try to be  informed.  And for some reason, I never saw a Mission Impossible movie.  And God, I guess I missed out.  Yeah.  They're all pretty good.  Yeah.  I'll give you that.  I fucking really like Ghost Protocol.  Action packed.  Oh, absolutely, man.  Two hours, I think it was.  About two hours.  And the action barely stopped.  And the stunts were really good.  And they weren't hokey.  I hate when stunts get so ridiculous. 
[00:03:00]  Obviously, the stunts in Mission Impossible and Ghost Protocol are borderline ridiculous.  But you don't feel like, okay, that's just so stupid.  And it's Mission Impossible.  Right.  It's supposed to be a little over the top.  So you give them a little bit on that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I just hate when it's some ridiculous scenario that they end up getting out of.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But then people are going to see Ghost Protocol and go, hey, asshole, that's exactly what  happened in this movie.  I guess I can't really explain it properly.  No, I'll explain it.  That it's Mission Impossible.  And they're supposed to have gadgetry and be like fucking, you know, pretty amazing with 
[00:03:30]  their stunts and shit like that.  Right.  I was watching that goddamn movie and it got good reviews.  It's the one with fucking Denzel and the train and the Captain Kirk guy from the last  Star Trek movie.  Oh, fuck.  What was the name of that?  Yeah, that one.  What was the name of it?  Oh, I'm looking.  I'm looking.  No, not the taking a pill.  Unstoppable.  Unstoppable.  Thank you, fish man.  Okay.  Yeah, Unstoppable.  And there's a scene where the train's going around a curve a little too fast. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And the fucking train comes up where it's just on the wheels on the left side of the  train.  Okay.  And the right side is up off the tracks.  Okay.  And it's going around the corner.  It's like, no.  Now, this is supposed to be a movie not based on super action hero type shit.  Right.  That can't happen.  Okay, good.  So you understand what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll give a little, depending on the movie.  It's Mission Impossible.  They got wacky masks they pull off. 
[00:04:30]  They got gadgetry and fucking cool shit.  Right, right.  It's supposed to be that.  Okay.  But that's just two guys trying to stop a fucking train.  And it's up on, you know, one side of the wheels.  You know what?  And not derailing.  I think I can explain it this way.  When you're in a movie and the stunts are just over the top and crazy, if the audience  claps at the end of the particular scene, then you know that's basically saying to the  filmmakers, you did a really good job at this.  Oh, yeah, nice.  But there's also action scenes where when the scene finally ends, you look around, you 
[00:05:00]  see people like, oh, Jesus, really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the difference, I guess.  I guess that's...  In this movie, they were clapping a lot.  Like, holy fuck.  You sit there and a priest turns to you and goes, what a lump of shit that was.  Right, right.  How does that...  Well, because why would he do that?  Right, right.  Why would he say something I knew halfway through?  That's the train?  Oh, there it is.  I can't...  Oh, fuck it.  There it is.  It's up on its left side.  You know, now I gotta mention something else about this fucking movie, Unstoppable. 
[00:05:30]  It was named that because the camera that filmed it never stopped moving during the entire  fucking movie.  It got so annoying.  What do you mean it wouldn't stop moving?  Picture you're watching a movie and every...  Like Cloverfield shit?  Worse.  Nah.  Like, in a different way.  Not just shaky cam.  Okay.  They did shit with this where you're watching a movie, right?  And someone's in frame.  Right.  And then they're doing something and then all of a sudden out of nowhere, it's zoomed in. 
[00:06:00]  Not it zooms in.  Right.  It goes from that to bam, it's zoomed in.  Now it's zoomed out.  Okay.  And the camera is going around people too many times.  Right.  Like every time Denzel's on the train and they go, they have the camera going around  and I was...  All those swooping shots?  Swooping around shots.  I'm not a big fan of the over the top swooping shots.  And frame jump.  It was like frame chatter.  Frame jump.  Like it would jump forward, jump back.  That's everybody trying to show how good they are. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, it was hard to watch.  Distracting.  That's a cinematographer that's really obsessed with his craft.  And trying to come up with some shit.  Look, watch just some of these fucking shots.  It's...  It's like...  Now it's just normal trailer shots.  This is just normal movie shit.  I hear ya.  I saw that they zoomed out there.  They're not...  That's normal.  Like there's all kinds of...  This is all normal.  It's where the action starts.  But this is all...  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  God damn it.  They're not showing...  They're not showing what they did during the entire fucking movie. 
[00:07:00]  This is a good trailer.  Good movie.  It looks like a fantastic movie.  Well shot.  They fooled you on the trailer.  They fooled you.  Look, it's well shot.  All right.  I see nothing but steady...  You know, steady camera.  Because they didn't want the trailer to make people go,  Why the fuck are they doing with this with the camera?  There's a blonde in Ghost Protocol.  Yeah.  And I begged Roland.  I'm like, can we please have her on the show?  This chick is so god damn sexy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But then Roland goes... 
[00:07:30]  But you don't know what to believe with Roland, unfortunately.  He goes...  I don't think she speaks English.  What?  I guess she's Russian.  But I think she...  Like a crazy person.  Maybe she didn't speak English in the whole movie.  Now that...  No, she had a few lines in English.  She is fucking gorgeous, man.  Can you pop her up and maybe Google image the shit out of her?  Oh, wow.  She was way better looking than the lead brought there, Jane.  Who was Paula Patton who's coming in.  And Simon Pegg was really good. 
[00:08:00]  Really good in this movie.  You know, he's the tech guy in Mission Impossible.  Yeah, yeah.  Ghost Protocol.  And, you know, he had that whole humor thing going, you know?  He's the...  Keeping it fun.  He's the fucking left.  That's her?  Is it?  Uh-oh.  That's really...  Oh, boy.  What'd you do there?  There's a little drop off.  You put yourself out there before you looked at the picture, didn't you?  I'll...  My reputation will be on the line on this one.  No problem.  She was fucking sexy in this movie.  That's not the same girl, man.  I know it's the same girl, but... 
[00:08:30]  Anyway, go back.  Go to that picture again.  Who does that look like?  A girl version of...  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Holy shit, it does.  Another girl E-Rock.  Holy fuck, it does.  It's girl E-Rock.  And now with the blonde.  Just look at the eyes.  Look at that.  Wow.  Look at the eyes.  That's E-Rock.  She's pretty, though, except for her face.  She's all right.  Hey, is there any stills from Ghost Protocol?  That is E-Rock face right there.  Because she...  Scarlet Joe Nagel.  Wow, man.  She looks way better in Mission Impossible than these Google Image shots. 
[00:09:00]  They gussied her up?  I get...  That's almost...  She looks all right there.  Yeah.  She looks all right there.  She had those pillow lips that were getting a little dry.  I love when the pillow lips get a little dry.  I don't like it.  Is that her?  Huh?  I guess so.  And, you know, they're so puffy that she has a tough time keeping them moist all the  time.  I don't like that.  So it gets slightly dry.  Angelina.  Go all the way to the right.  And now down.  No, down one.  That one.  I like that.  Fucking Sam doesn't know how to pick out girl shots. 
[00:09:30]  He doesn't.  He's fucking gay.  Someone has to say it.  You don't know how to pick out girl shots.  I just picked the one where your tits were showing.  Yeah, but that was...  Yeah, because it's not about the tits showing.  Because you never fucking develop past 13.  Sometimes a shot can be really sexy without the tits.  Yeah, like I wanted to see the wild, windy, blonde hair look.  All right, look.  I know, but it was...  Hold on.  You didn't know which one.  Hold on.  Out of all these pictures on the screen, which one would you pick?  All right, Opie, I'm going to pick one right now.  And I'm being honest.  I'm picking one. 
[00:10:00]  Which one I would pick?  All right, but the problem is I know which one you're going to pick.  And there's two that he should be picking.  Okay.  Is that fair enough?  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, Sam.  Which one would you pick?  This one?  No.  Nope.  I would take the one with the shirt.  That one I would have picked.  That's the one I would have picked.  All right, but see, that was your second choice.  No.  The shirt I first tried to pick this one.  Here's why I would have taken that one.  Because you can see if she has camel toes.  She's wearing spandex shorts.  So I want to look at the...  I want to look at her face first.  The sexy face first.  I want to get to know her.  Right, exactly.  And then you look at her cunt. 
[00:10:30]  I like the movie, but I was telling...  Well, I said it on Twitter.  There was a picture that came out of Tom Cruise.  I don't know how to say the name of that fucking building.  The Burge Tower, I believe.  Something like that.  The Burge Tower?  That's something.  That big building over there.  Yeah, the big tall one.  Yeah.  And the scene they show from this building is horrifying.  Yeah.  They are really fucking high.  And I'm not giving it away because I think it's in the trailers, but they take out the  window and then Tom's got a...  Tom. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Tom's character has to do some things.  And when he's climbing on the outside of the building, I'm like, holy fuck.  What do they erase all the lines?  Yeah.  How do they do that shit?  They digitally take out the wires.  It's fucking amazing.  Oh, damn.  It's horrifying to watch.  And I'm okay with heights in general.  I'm just okay with it.  But yeah, that shot that we've all seen where he's just hanging out on the tippy top of  the building.  Sitting there?  Just sitting there?  I'm like, it's not in the movie.  Yeah.  And I would figure if you shot this, why wouldn't you just have it in the movie somehow? 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Why wouldn't you have that in the movie?  They have that.  That was just a publicity shot where he sat there for like an hour.  They said he signed the top of it too.  Like the only color guys are signing the top.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  And he's just sitting on the top of the tallest building in the world.  And it looks like there's nothing.  That's got to be swaying.  Nothing attached to him.  That's got to be swaying.  I bet he loves that shit though.  Because he's like a real adventure guy.  He probably does most of his own stunts.  Scientologist.  So he thinks if he dies, he's going to go to some better place. 
[00:12:00]  A lot of the guys that are into mountain climbing and stuff, they would fucking, they would  love to do something like that.  Right?  Jesus.  But you would think if they shot that, they would put it in the movie somehow.  And they just did it.  Why would Jim Phelps be sitting up on top of a building like that, just taking in the  view?  Yeah.  I'm just sitting.  Stop the music.  I thought, I don't know, maybe the satellite receiver was up there or something.  Oh.  Oh, I would be so frightened I would fall to my death.  Oh, that would be horrid.  Oh, forget it. 
[00:12:30]  Just terrible.  You're crazy.  I don't know.  I mean, no surprise here.  Ghost Protocol, thumbs up.  I liked it a lot.  And now I want to go back and see all the movies.  So you see that view?  Is that him right there?  Which one?  Wow, yeah.  That's actually him?  He's barefoot, yeah.  That's not photoshopped.  Oh, is that?  You know what?  That might be this photoshopped.  That kind of looks photoshopped.  That kind of looks photoshopped.  He's just got a t-shirt on.  But that could easily be him.  No, you can see it's different.  But they would have a picture like that.  Sure, but he's leaning too much and it's just... 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, but if you've got some wires attached to the back, you'd be cool with leaning a little bit.  That's crazy.  This video of guys sitting up there with no...  No, they're not attached at all.  They're just guys sitting...  That's unbelievable.  ...on the very, very highest point you can go.  That's unbelievable.  I told you I dreamt about this.  This actually prevented me from sleeping.  Really?  When I first saw these on YouTube, the clips from outside the tower were upsetting.  When you see the building for the first time in the movie, you're like, holy fuck. 
[00:13:30]  Because there's nothing anywhere as close to that height around it.  Yeah, they just went all out on that one.  Here in New York, when you used to have the Twin Towers and Empire State Building, there's  so many other kind of buildings around it.  Sure, they're not nearly as tall, but it takes away from it a little bit.  When you see this just...  Gives you a little build-up.  Huh?  Gives you a little build-up to the big building.  Yeah, man.  Not just in the middle of nothing.  There's a hotel in there.  Makes you want to go to Dubai.  Fuck yeah, man.  It does, right?  I want to go.  Yeah.  Me and Jonathan are going to go.  Go to Duthel.  There's a shot. 
[00:14:00]  When they're going to Dubai.  Yeah, that was just fucking horrifying.  Horrifying.  That's in the movie.  That was fucking horrifying.  Where he's like...  That's pretty cool.  Where he's just being held on by his leg.  He's hanging upside down.  Hanging outside the window they knocked out.  I would hate that.  And that's the dude...  Who wouldn't?  That's the dude from Hurt Locker.  He was great in the movie, too.  Yeah, I mean, runner, yeah.  And I don't think we're going to get him, unfortunately.  Why?  We're going to get Simon Pegg.  We're going to get the lead actress.  I just said her name.  I forgot it already.  Same day? 
[00:14:30]  I think so.  And then we're going to get the guy that was in Slumdog Millionaire.  He's in this movie.  Which guy?  Millionaire.  He was the game show host in Slumdog Millionaire.  Oh, yeah, he was good.  He's like a playboy in this movie.  Who wants to be a millionaire?  He was pretty good in the movie, too.  Yeah?  I mean, he had a much smaller role than the other two, but...  How come we're not getting Jeremy Renner?  I don't know.  According to Roland, some kind of scheduling conflict with Regis, or whatever the fuck they call  that show now.  I know, he went back to, he took the plane into the red eye. 
[00:15:00]  If you listen to Roland, he always has information that not even a manager would have yet.  There was a water main break on the plane five minutes ago.  How did you know that?  He couldn't know.  He had to turn around in mid-flight.  He gets mad, but I think it is part of his job to kind of be a schmoozer.  Yeah.  He really knows how to schmooze.  A schmoozer.  I think you have to do that in his line of work.  Because I don't know what to believe sometimes, and I've told Roland, I'm like, you've got  to keep it honest with us.  You know, you've got to tell us the truth.  Well, he tells you the truth. 
[00:15:30]  And maybe he is.  I don't know.  He smooths all corners.  He likes it all the way smooth.  Smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he has an answer for everything.  That's why he's really good at his job.  How come we said that we were going to get this Adam Sandler, but we didn't?  So now, because this plane, it was supposed to be a four o'clock departure, and it was like  7.30.  That was six months ago.  How do you remember that?  Do we really need Adam Sandler on our show?  It would have been fun to talk to him.  He's a bore.  Still.  I've never seen him in an interview.  It's good to be here, fellas.  I've never seen him in an interview where he was interesting. 
[00:16:00]  Good to be here, fellas.  I'm going to sing a song.  I'm going to sing a little song for...  Shut up.  Did we do that same time?  Probably.  But there's a shot.  The car's in the desert as they're making their way to the big building there in Dubai.  Yeah.  And it's all just desert.  And then you see the city?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Middle of nowhere.  You know when you're driving in from Long Island, and you kind of, you know, all of a sudden  you see that just New York City just popping up?  Yeah.  And it's like, holy fuck, that is pretty amazing if you just, you know, sit back for a second 
[00:16:30]  and really look at it.  Yeah, you kind of take it for granted now.  Just erase everything in the way and make it a desert.  Like a desert, and then all of a sudden you come over a hill.  All of a sudden it's just this massive fucking city in the middle of a desert.  That's what it looks like.  You know, the shot they filmed anyway.  Dubai, that's what they make Dubai look like.  Dubai.  That scene was ridiculous.  How the fuck was he on the outside of that building filming?  That's scary.  Huh?  That's scary.  Yeah.  It looks cool though.  I'll see it at some juncture. 
[00:17:00]  Well, yeah.  You said the IMAX though wasn't the...  I like IMAX 3D because when you put the glasses on, it doesn't matter where you sit.  Yeah.  And it's just right there in front of you.  You know what I'm trying to say?  When it's just a regular movie on IMAX, the screen is like, I'm just moving left to right.  And we have pretty good seats.  You gotta move your head too much.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe you're supposed to sit way back.  That's probably it.  I'm sure the geeks know exactly where to sit in an IMAX theater. 
[00:17:30]  We were right in the middle.  It seemed like it was like prime seating.  Yeah.  But there was so much on the side still that I had to move around to check out everything.  And I don't know if that's good.  No.  People have said to me, it's like, why are you playing Call of Duty on TV?  Why don't you play it down in your theater?  That would be so cool.  It would be big.  It's like, how am I going to play a game where I'm getting hit when I just have to move my eyes around the screen?  Right.  You literally have to move your entire head around to scope the area out. 
[00:18:00]  It just doesn't work as well.  I mean, it's really cool, but then after a while you're like, oh God, you know, I just  want to kind of watch this thing without having to move my head as much as I am.  Getting that around.  I don't know.  Maybe that's being picky.  Yeah.  Arga.  I see those guys.  Those are the guys sitting up there on top of the tower.  Is that the actual tower?  Oh, yeah.  They're on top of the...  Look at that.  No, hold that.  Holy fuck.  Why don't you climb up that little peg?  This is what we're sitting on.  Just little purges on top of the tallest building in the freaking world. 
[00:18:30]  It's windy.  My heart is pounding like crazy.  I got my strip.  I am holding on to this post like no other.  Those little buildings that you see way down there are big buildings.  It's like if you sat on one of those, you'd be high up.  It's not wind.  How do they get to that perch?  Do they have to climb on the outside after a while?  No, no, no.  Inside.  Oh, that's easy.  I'm not even joking.  That's easy.  So you got to get out and sit your ass down.  Oh, I'd be fucking out of my mind freaked out.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  Is that water down there?  You could dive into it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  I did that.  I sure you did, Chip.  Crazy stuff, guys.  It's a cannonball.  This is called sitting on the world's tallest building if you want to look it up for yourself  on YouTube.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  What's that?  Look at that view, man.  It's like so...  You ever go to the CN Tower in Toronto?  I think that's the tallest in North America or something like that.  That shit is fucking cool, man.  Highly recommend you do that.  I thought of it, but it just scared me.  Why? 
[00:19:30]  You were close and you didn't do it?  No, no, no, no.  Just give me.  Oh, yeah.  This fucking video.  This is Scared of Heights.  Don't watch this.  That's what this video is called.  To these Russians.  Yeah, crazy ass Russians.  It's a broad, really sexy broad.  And she scoots her way out onto the...  On an I-beam.  On an I-beam.  Way the fuck up on some structure.  With nothing attached to her.  These Russians are crazy.  And then this kid...  Doesn't he walk out?  And they're not attached at all. 
[00:20:00]  No, they're just...  How high up would you say they are?  Higher than you'd ever want to be.  Yeah.  That's a great way to put it.  It's fucking crazy high up.  I'd probably 20 feet in the air.  I would say...  I would guess...  A few hundred feet.  I would guess at least 300 feet to 400 feet.  Yeah.  And the guy is just standing at the end of an I-beam.  Looking out.  Would you do that?  No.  It looks like soft trees down there. 
[00:20:30]  So he'd probably be okay.  You think?  I wouldn't even scoot out onto that thing.  I wouldn't either.  I wouldn't climb up it.  And he just like stood straight up.  I wouldn't go to that godforsaken country.  What's the top left, Sam?  The red guy in the red.  My favorite one is the guy that is changing the light bulbs or whatever the fuck he's  doing where he just climbs forever.  That's the scariest one.  I think that's the scariest one too.  It's a helmet camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's a game.  Did you see the one...  Oh, fudge. 
[00:21:00]  For some reason, they keep taking that video down.  I don't know why.  Because it's a professional video and the people that put it up are pissed off because  it's going viral.  It's like, of course it should go viral.  I don't know.  It's been taken offline a bunch of times.  This guy's...  What is this now?  Tightrope walking over Yosemite Falls.  No.  Well, that's a...  You know.  Those guys...  Professionals.  Yeah.  Those are professionals, man.  That's Philippe Petit shit.  The worst thing is seeing him lay down on that tower... 
[00:21:30]  Oh, by far.  Between the Twin Towers.  That's the most...  You see that photo?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I am so bummed out that they didn't have a really good video when Philippe Petit was  doing his shit.  Terrible.  I know.  How do you not have a good video of that?  That documentary is worth watching.  I'm telling you.  Because what went into doing that?  They had to shoot arrows across from one tower to the other, secure lines overnight.  That's amazing.  And then he fucking just tightropes in between the Twin Towers.  And they don't have good footage.  They only have a still shot of him laying on the wire. 
[00:22:00]  And they have some video from the street where you can see just this speck.  But it doesn't really give you a feeling for how crazy it was.  But they have a lot of good photos of him just stepping out onto the fucking...  Oh, my God, man.  It gives me the fucking willies.  He wasn't attached to shit.  That's the scariest one, man.  Do people understand that?  Fuck that.  And then he laid on his back.  And he was talking about a bird that he could see right above him.  Oh, yeah.  And he's just looking at the sky.  Dude, I'm getting all fucked up.  Great.  Just you talking about it.  I'm getting all fucked up.  I just got the chills. 
[00:22:30]  Can you imagine laying there and all of a sudden, instead of being him, you're Opie again.  And you're like, I don't know how to do this.  I don't know how to do this.  I'm not that guy.  He got me out here.  I would suck.  I would just hold the wire as tight as I could, face down, and just fucking pray that someone's  going to...  Help me!  Rescue me.  Did you ever see footage of the guy doing the pull-ups?  Oh, from the fucking high beam?  Oh, yeah.  That could be my second worst one.  Look up the pull-ups.  That is a bad one, yeah.  High up pull-ups.  That's the second worst one, I think.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  I used to watch all these.  I haven't watched them in a while.  No, pull-ups off a building or something.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Sam goes to a gym.  Oh, God, Sam.  Sam, pull-ups in a gym.  Don't you look at the thumbnail?  Right there with the orange.  Yeah, there you go.  Just look at the thumbnail, Sam.  Look at this.  This is a crane.  Well, mother wouldn't get it.  It's a pull-ups on a French crane if you're following along at home.  Is this the one, Jimmy?  Um...  I'm...  Yeah, this is the one.  They had to make it into a music video.  You don't have to spice up your shit sometimes.  They're way up, too. 
[00:23:30]  How high up would you say?  That's at least, uh...  That's 50 stories?  Yeah, that's about 500 feet.  They're looking down at huge buildings.  At really huge buildings.  Yeah.  50...  They are fucking high up, man.  It's this dumb French-y music.  You don't like this?  Stupid French.  Terrible.  Fucking French.  And then the guy decides to...  This is a shitty video.  You guys had a great thing you did, and you have to make it into a shitty video. 
[00:24:00]  Because they're French.  It's already a minute in, and nothing's happening, and you're listening to a song you don't give a fuck about.  Here he is, finally.  He's not wired in?  No, not at all.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait.  Is he wearing a parachute?  I don't know.  There's something on his back.  I know.  Just in case, maybe.  He's doing pull-ups now.  And, of course, everyone knows...  Wow, that's fucking crazy.  You've got to figure out how many you can do, because if you can't come back up, now you're fucked.  Look at how high he is. 
[00:24:30]  Really high.  This guy's doing it, too.  Yeah, they're both doing it.  He's doing the pull-ups where he's...  Imagine your hands start sweating, and you just...  Imagine.  They are now watching.  You feel that slipping going on?  My thing is, even if it is a parachute, where's the ripcord?  It's not in front of him.  Yeah, he could just fucking...  Oh, this guy could barely do pull-ups, too.  He only did two, and he's now just hanging there.  Just let go.  Huh?  Just let go.  That's fucking scary, man.  That's a terrible song. 
[00:25:00]  It's horrible.  It's horrible.  Bloody, bloody, bloody.  I would like him to superimpose my picture there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is what it would look like if I was doing this.  Just all kinds of heroic stuff.  You're doing it.  All photoshopped in.  That guy doesn't have anything on his back, so...  Right.  Yeah, he just did that.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  Why would you go out to the middle of a crane?  I would never go there.  I would just stay down on the bottom.  I don't want to do this.  Yeah, but on the floor.  This guy's saying you can walk around the CN Tower in Toronto. 
[00:25:30]  The bottom?  I saw this video.  On the outside?  Yeah, they attach you, and you can now walk around the outside.  No!  Yep.  This guy's right.  Greg...  Oh, Edge Walk, it's called.  It's called...  Yeah, okay.  They just opened this up.  I bet you this would be good to compete with the Vegas thing.  They just opened this up.  Yeah, a trick plane just went by.  Look how fucking high the CN Tower in Toronto is.  That's the train for us.  That's the stadium below.  You see that little dot?  Wow.  356 meters up in the sky.  Meters stop. 
[00:26:00]  1,168 feet above the ground.  Would you do that, Sam?  No.  We're going to walk on a 1.5 meter walk.  I would do this.  You're standing on the edge.  No, I wouldn't.  I'll be honest with you.  I would do this.  I wouldn't be happy about it, though.  I couldn't do it.  My feet wouldn't move.  Because they got the wires.  Acclimatize to the altitude that we're walking on today.  Okay, we're going to try a quick little exercise.  I couldn't stand up once I got there.  Really?  No, I wouldn't be able to.  I think the one that would really fuck me up the most would be the Grand Canyon thing.  When you're, like, walking on glass, I just...  I don't know.  Your mind gets all fucked up.  I did that at the Chicago Sears Tower. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Look at that stadium.  Look at how tiny the stadium is.  I know it's radio.  Sorry.  It's so fucking hot.  You see it in Tower Edge walking.  He's asking them just to step right to the edge.  Yeah.  You just turned your back to the edge, okay?  Do you have any idea what I'm going to ask you to do next?  Oh.  Lean back.  All right.  Okay, so what you do is give all your weight into your harness by sitting.  You're going to hang in your harness, pretty much.  They're hanging in their harness.  Oh, I think there's a different video than the first one we saw.  Oh, my God.  Nice and slow.  What are you doing?  Good stuff.  He's swinging out over the edge. 
[00:27:00]  Holy shit.  He's over the edge.  His feet.  And the harness is holding him?  Right.  To hear that harness go.  His whole body except his toes are over the side.  Ah, if he fell, that would suck.  I don't know if I could do that.  No.  I know you got the harness and all, but your mind will fuck with you.  Oh, man.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  You wouldn't do that, Sam?  No, and they're right next to each other.  I kick his legs out.  Oh, my God.  That would be scary. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, look.  The chick's going to do it.  And walking backwards.  She's like, I don't know.  You can actually just push yourself off the edge.  Nothing would happen.  Yeah.  I guess this is a different video.  The other one, they show him just walking around the whole thing.  Toes are propped up a bit.  My knees are very weak right now.  It's because I'm here.  Oh.  You're swooning for Jimmy.  He's so cute.  Would you jump off this like they do in Vegas?  I wouldn't even know.  What was that thing called again with the ding?  The fucking...  The ding. 
[00:28:00]  Um, I don't know.  I told you my ex did it, though.  That was fucking horrifying.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's an airplane.  They just got a fly.  There's an airplane flying next to them.  That looked like they could touch it.  Oh, my God.  How did they get back inside?  This is just a little door.  That's easy.  But no, but do they walk around the whole thing?  They all have to plummet to their death.  Supposedly, yeah.  The video I saw, they were testing it out.  There's planes lower than they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would never do that.  I guess their rules are different in Canada. 
[00:28:30]  Those planes are way too close to the top.  Look, see, now the girl's going to the edge.  Look.  She's leaning forward.  Yeah.  If that snaps, she falls.  She's leaning forward over the edge.  But that's not going to snap.  Trusting your life.  But your brain doesn't understand that.  Yeah, you want to trust some fucking union guy who hooked it up?  Yeah.  Unhook?  Who knows?  Sorry.  What's he doing?  He's fiddling with the latch.  Stop fiddling with that latch.  He's fiddling with it.  No, see, that's the second line, though, to make it completely safe. 
[00:29:00]  That's all they're doing.  That's not completely safe.  It's completely safe staying home.  Right.  Cutting the malarkey.  How about the whole steel structure just comes off?  Everything.  And now you're falling, all of you together, with the iron.  Can you imagine falling on the outside of that?  Oh, that'd suck.  Wow, that's fucked up, man.  Wow.  We got time in the stadium.  You could jump right into that stadium.  Yeah.  Don't jump in.  Make it like a slide in a second or something, right?  Yeah, Chim.  No, Chim.  A base hit or something.  You'd die.  You got to pull off all the moves. 
[00:29:30]  You got to move it a little bit and back up all your boasting, okay?  Fucking crank tunes.  Crank tunes?  You'd have your iPod on up there?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Western Massachusetts.  Jimmy!  Hey.  Morning, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I wanted to see if I get some feedback on you guys.  Did you see the six-minute prologue for the new Batman in that IMAX screening?  No, what happened was, yeah, I went and saw Ghost Protocol, if you're just tuning in, 
[00:30:00]  and I liked it, the new Mission Impossible movie.  The goals!  And a lot of people are asking because I guess they're attaching some Batman Dark Knight Rises  preview or something, but I didn't get to see that.  Roland invited me, and I thought this was just kind of stupid, and a lot of film geeks are  going to be pissed off at me, but I could have went to a six-minute showing of the new  Batman movie with the director there.  But I'm like, what is that, 20 minutes? 
[00:30:30]  That's awesome.  Why would that be awesome?  Six minutes of the movie?  Imagine if it was just the first six minutes of the credits.  Right.  That's kind of be awesome.  Six minutes of the movie, and then what's his name?  Who's doing the new?  Chris Nolan.  Yeah, Chris Nolan.  Was going to be there, I guess.  Where was this?  And I guess most movie geeky guys would fucking come in their pants if they had that opportunity.  I'm like, I don't want to go all the way out of my way to be in a movie theater  from 15, 20 minutes.  Who's the bad guy?  Without Heath Legger.  Bane.  Huh?  Bane is the bad guy.  Who's Bane?  He's like a big, strong guy. 
[00:31:00]  He's got big muscles.  He plays a venom.  The guy from Inception, the British guy we met in the bar or whatever.  Yeah.  I think his name's Thomas Hardy.  I loved Inception.  Oh, yeah?  It was really good.  You loved Inception?  I loved it.  I still haven't seen that one.  It was great.  Oh, shit.  What is this?  This will replace my bootleg.  I mean, this will replace, you know.  That was good.  Oh, yeah.  We just got Planet of the Apes Blu-rays.  Who's got a monkey face?  I do.  Who's got a monkey face?  Everybody's got their face. 
[00:31:30]  DVDs in front of their faces.  This is going to be fun during commercial break.  When the mics are off, I'm going to say a few things.  Oh, look at me.  Get out of here.  Get me some bananas.  Oh, look at me.  Oh, boy.  I'm just gorilla-ing around over here or something.  Kenny?  Kenny, could you get me some blueberry pie, please?  Okay.  What?  They was the ones that ate the blueberry pie!  What?  Commercial's on. 
[00:32:00]  Reverend Al, look.  Oh, yeah.  That's a coincidence.  It was a coincidence, asshole.  What are you, trying to get me in trouble?  Look at you.  Look at me.  I'm eating some fruit and vegetables.  It's the worst improv.  Look at me.  I'm having a cup of gorilla coffee.  We get it, Helen.  The radio can't see that I'm holding the Planet of the Apes box, which is just a gorilla face  in front of my face, and I'm being the gorilla.  This isn't how either confident or stupid we are.  We just did an hour of radio that was completely visual.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  We don't give a shit.  Right.  Oh, look at me.  I'm somebody's uncle.  Yes, you are.  Oh, look at me.  Where's my wrench?  Where's my wrench?  I get it.  Yeah.  Quit meeing around.  Oh, you should go back to your barrel.  Don't me around.  Oh, God.  The Donkey Kong.  Where are you?  Where's the princess?  I'm Donkey Kong-ing right now.  Don't talk to me.  This way.  I got to tweak this.  Which way is that?  I can't see.  I'm a gorilla lady. 
[00:33:00]  A gorilla lady.  Oh, look.  Don't get my fingers in there.  They're going to know I'm holding this.  Oh, look.  Where's the bananas?  Oh, God.  Wait.  Somebody get me the bananas.  Look how stupid you look.  What's that?  I can't see anything.  I'm gorilla lady.  Oh, there he is.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, gorilla.  I'll give you.  I'm so curious right now.  Oh, like George.  That's exactly it.  That's good.  I'm going to tweak this. 
[00:33:30]  Now you got your visual.  That's fucking hilarious.  That's good.  Guess who's in the middle?  Who's in the middle?  Oh, I am.  Oh, I am.  And I've got a little blonde lady on my back.  Where's that Winona Ryder lady?  I don't know.  You who climb on my back, lady.  I'll take you to the top of the Empire State Building.  Where's that Jack Black?  He's terrific.  You like him?  I sure do. 
[00:34:00]  Fat with no charisma.  He's perfect for the movies.  I'm in the middle.  I'm in the middle.  Got it.  Yes.  Yes, in the middle.  Yes, I am.  I think you've done them all.  I sure have.  I think you've done them all.  I sure have.  Oh, quick.  Somebody make some cookies out of me.  What type of business is this?  Oh, this is monkey business.  Oh, I get it.  That's right.  Quick. 
[00:34:30]  I'm an animal cracker.  Get me some milk or something.  I'm Chip Monkey Lady.  I'm Chip Chipperson.  Chip Chipperson.  Chip Chipperson.  Oh, looks like I'm on top of the plane throwing it or something, sis.  Sis.  Oh, no.  King Kong.  I was never even the prince.  It's sis.  It's sis. 
[00:35:00]  Chipperson.  Yes, Chimp.  You have a sick fucking monkeys.  I just want to talk like that for the rest of the day.  Who wouldn't?  Sounds like Helen Bergeron.  Yes.  Doing a Chip impression as a monkey.  Kitty's stupid.  We're going to talk to someone that's stupid.  It's all we do.  Kitty, what's up?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Hope you didn't throw anything on the ground and not in the garbage can. 
[00:35:30]  Because I'd hate to see Kitty litter.  Hey, what's up with that?  Where's your porn?  I want Kitty's porn.  Kitty.  Kitty.  Kitty.  Hello?  Good evening.  Hi.  You're on the air.  Turn down your radio.  Hi, Kitty.  How are you?  Hello, Kitty.  Kitty.  What do you have to say today?  Um, it's Katie, not Kitty.  All right, Katie.  Well, how about you figure that out a while ago? 
[00:36:00]  Now, the jokes don't make any sense.  Right.  Sure.  That's Katie litter.  She's waiting for us to say her proper name.  Obviously, it was written down.  Hello, Mademoiselle.  All right, Katie.  Why does everyone say happy birthday to Jimmy?  Because it's his birthday today.  My birthday.  It's not every day.  It is.  They don't do it every day.  Only on his birthday, which happens to be today.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  No, it can't be a birthday every day.  It's not his birthday every day. 
[00:36:30]  We all know that's impossible.  Every day.  Where's she from?  Oh, Michigan.  Okay, that's that.  That's Canada, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah, look on the map.  Are you in the D?  I'm not in Michigan.  Are you in the D?  Nothing.  Michigan's part of Canada.  No, it's six in the morning right now.  She's right.  What?  I think she's like, hey, we're part of Michigan.  Canada?  Canada?  Detroit?  Berlin Heights?  Yeah, it's like north of Detroit.  All right, north of Detroit is Canada.  Yeah.  So you're Canada, basically. 
[00:37:00]  That's crazy.  Do you hold up your hand like a mitten and then point on your hand where you're from?  That's what people from Michigan do.  Why?  Because the state looks like a hand.  It does?  A mitten.  And then they go, I'm from here.  Oh.  Oh, it's just.  Oh.  I do the same thing when I'm talking about New Jersey, but I do it with a palsy foot.  I wish I lived in Florida.  I just point to my cock.  Right.  Sure.  Yeah.  I live on the cock head.  It's flat with a lot of old people on it.  And my balls are the panhandle. 
[00:37:30]  The oniony panhandle.  I hate to live in the oniony part of Florida.  Yeah, of course.  See?  That's what people do.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Who does that?  People from Michigan.  Oh, monkey lady.  That's good.  What part of the ashtray hand are you from?  I'm right.  Katie, dear, go ahead.  Talk.  I'm going to hold it up to that window and see if they think someone's coming to work.  You're rolling? 
[00:38:00]  I didn't say anything.  What?  Roll it.  Katie, we're too fast for you.  We're going to have to let you go.  Yeah, we're too sharp.  Wow.  We're a little too sharp for you.  We're a bunch of sharp techs.  Yeah.  All right there, Mitten State.  Why don't we break?  Because we got some Sandusky shit.  Yeah.  Oh, the food's not here yet?  I don't see it.  Not that it matters.  Oh, I got a scolding for a Sandusky joke. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, did you?  From who?  From the audience?  Fucking Phelps, ladies.  What?  Margie Phelps.  She's on your shit?  Who cares?  Ann Coulter retweeted me my Sandusky joke.  What was the Sandusky joke, first of all?  Because they said that he was supposed to face his accusers.  Right.  And I said he's now refusing to face his accusers.  He'd much rather stand behind them.  Oh, there you go.  Stupid ass fucking child joke.  Yeah, that's a good ass fucking joke.  That's great.  Wordplay.  Yeah.  And Margie Phelps was like, you mock sin.  Shut up, you cunt.  You mock sin? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Some of the chip tweets were great.  That's why his feet is warm, because he's mocking sins.  That's a good one.  The chip tweets were fucking having me rolling.  Mock sin.  Yeah, Sandusky, he's just a twat.  He's just an asshole.  The accusers were ready to face him, and then, what, at the last second, the lawyer bailed?  He'd go right to trial instead of...  Right.  I wonder why.  I'm wondering...  Because the guy's fucked.  No, no, but what...  Because a lot of lawyers are saying that's bad, but I'm wondering... 
[00:39:30]  It is bad, but it's the only choice he has.  They won't have any pre-trial things happening that the jury will be tainted by?  Right.  Like, there won't be any emotional outbursts or moments that potential jurors can read about.  Uh-huh.  I mean, why else would he...  Well, there's something that was really, believe it or not, very funny about the press conference yesterday with this Amendola.  Well, I was telling him before the show, it seems just as creepy as Sandusky.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He just seems like he's a fucking creep as well.  I don't know.  You could say he's a creep.  That's a fair point.  Yeah, but this guy, there's something going on with him as well.  I know he...  Yeah, there's nothing really...  I know he knocked up somebody and...  What's a creep?  Yeah, it's an opinion.  You could say that.  He was with a little girl or whatever, right, and knocked her up, and then they were married,  but then they had a divorce and stuff, but I bet you that's just the tip of the iceberg with this guy.  Oh.  Shenanigans.  I don't know, though.  But the grand jury report says Penn State wide receiver coach Mike McQuarrie witnessed Sandusky,  who faces more than 50 sex abuse counts, rape a boy in a campus locker room. 
[00:40:30]  McQuarrie, the report says, told Joe Paterno and two university officials, but failed to notify police.  If you believe that, Amendola, who's Sandusky's lawyer, he said,  I suggest you dial 1-800-REALITY.  Uh-huh.  And everyone just let that, you know, fly by yesterday.  Yeah.  But I've got to give credit to, who the fuck did this, Deadspin.  Deadspin.com said, well, I'm going to call the fucking number.  Let me ring that up, you know, just to see what 1-800-REALITY would be, 
[00:41:00]  because he's encouraging everyone to call that.  Right.  Maybe he's plugging something.  If you believe McQuarrie's, you know, the McQuarrie angle.  Yeah.  Well, we called it this morning.  I would love to hear it.  And this is really 1-800-REALITY.  This is really it.  If you dial it, you're going to get this.  Oh, good production.  Yeah.  Travis is fun, eh? 
[00:41:30]  Brought to you by National.  You must be over 18.  Enter your credit card now to join the fun.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  What is that number?  Huh?  What was that number?  1-800-REALITY.  I'll show you reality.  Hey, you want reality? 
[00:42:00]  You want reality?  Lots of the cum walker.  Obviously, the lawyer had no idea, but oops.  Oops.  Yeah.  That's what you get if you call 1-800-REALITY,  the phone number that he referenced during the press conference yesterday.  What a coincidence.  Oh, great.  You can't just blurt out phone numbers like that.  No.  It's probably going to be taken by something.  Nine out of ten, it's going to be something brutal, right?  Reality.  Why reality?  Why did they get that?  Well, I guess that is a dose of reality.  It sure is.  That's a waker-upper. 
[00:42:30]  If you're looking for some sweaty man-cock, the reality is, here you go, fella.  Goddamn.  What?  What?  Wow, really?  Youth football coaches resign after they allow...  I fucking hate this.  Oh.  Youth football coaches resign after they allow a team to burn their third-place trophies.  Oh.  So, there's a team. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  They come in third place.  Sucks.  And obviously, they're like, fuck this.  We're not happy with third place.  Yeah.  And I guess the team, because it says allow, which means it seems like the players came  up with this idea.  Yeah.  And they wanted to burn their third-place trophies, because fuck that.  Makes sense.  What's a third-place trophy?  Is that why?  I don't even want a runner-up trophy.  I used to hate that when I was growing up, too.  And I guess the youth football coaches had to resign over this, because...  Do they have to, or do they want to resign?  And that was like the last...  Let's find out. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, I bet they had to.  Because they show this commercial on TV before we get on the air about...  Oh, that's stupid.  I love a trophy for everybody.  It's the one with the basketball player, where this play goes down in the team's favor, and  then the goody two-shoes goes, Coach, I touched this.  Coach, I touched this.  I touched the ball before it went out.  I touched this.  He's like, oh...  Anyone that has ever played sports, you just know that's part of the game, that the ref's  going to fuck up some calls, and in the end, it kind of is a wash. 
[00:44:00]  You're going to get fucked on a bad call.  You're going to...  You know, it's going to be in your favor every once in a while.  But this commercial they're trying to shove down your throat, like, you know, sportsmanship,  and then what does it say?  For a better living or something?  For assholes.  For a better life, or it's some kind of...  Some time...  Some, excuse me, type of group.  What are they trying to push?  Honesty.  That we all should be a little more honest than we are, I guess.  And it's better.  Can you find that online?  There's another one.  It drives me nuts.  What's the purpose?  What are they trying to sell?  They're trying to just... 
[00:44:30]  It's like a public service thing.  For what?  For being honest.  If you make a mistake, and it's overlooked, and somebody is going to...  Why sports, though?  Have repercussions for that, then...  Because it's not sporting.  To win or get an advantage because of a lie.  We've all been in a situation, if you've played sports, where you're like, holy fuck, I just got away with that.  Do you think there's too much of that stress with sports?  I think so.  I don't know.  It's a ball. 
[00:45:00]  It's not how high you can fly.  It's not how fast you can run.  Or how many touchdowns you can score that matters.  It's really how you play the game that counts.  Because the game only lasts four quarters.  For a few years.  For that moment in time.  The raping lasts forever.  Good sportsmanship.  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  Sportsmanship.  What's that?  Last a lifetime.  No, it's sportsmanship.  What's that?  See, there's nothing wrong with that commercial.  Sportsmanship, yeah, you should teach that.  Yeah.  No problem.  But teaching that everyone wins, and everyone gets a trophy, I hate all that shit. 
[00:45:30]  Because that's not how real life is.  But a lot of problems are happening because of that mentality.  Yeah, because of that mentality.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  That's why they're jumping out the window at NYU, because they don't know how to lose.  They don't know how to not be rewarded, or to be told that you did right or good.  They haven't learned those.  There's weird lessons you learn when you lose, if you lose gracefully, or if you win gracefully.  Yeah.  There's weird things you learn that develop you as a person.  The whole Occupy thing is based on that mentality, I think. 
[00:46:00]  Occupy, right?  My first love growing up was basketball.  Well, and when we lost, I was fucking depressed, and my dad would sit me down and talk to me,  and then if it was something I did in the game, then I would go and practice that skill  to hopefully be better next time.  You know what I mean?  It was a whole thing.  Oh, you're a bulldog.  Remember that in the Gray Santini?  Oh, yeah.  Squirt a little.  And that seems like the way to go about it, no?  Yeah.  And I always saw the kids that had no business playing basketball. 
[00:46:30]  So then it weeds out the people that maybe they should go try something else.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah.  What is wrong with that?  But if you have a sport and everyone wins, what does that accomplish?  Nothing.  It's nonsense, because they don't do the same thing in other competitive things like computers.  You're not going to get a computer job equally with other people who are much better than you.  But they expect that now.  And that's the whole thing I'm saying with Occupy is like, they expect people that have 
[00:47:00]  done well to, that they owe them something because of their upbringing.  Because everybody, everyone wins a trophy mentality.  We all got a trophy.  We all won.  There wasn't any real winner or loser.  We're all in this together.  So if you win, why don't I get a trophy too?  So if you get a fucking nice car, why don't I have a nice car or a house or a fucking,  yeah.  Because the problem wasn't winning or losing.  It was like these shitty parents that didn't know how to tell their kids, hey, you fucking  act better when you win. 
[00:47:30]  Or hey, losing is okay and this is why.  It's all these shitty parents that would fight at the soccer games and have these competitive,  cock-sucking parents that didn't know how to teach their kids.  So instead they're like, oh, I can't handle losing.  So give my kid a trophy.  There's no more losing.  We have to decide that.  It's nothing.  I want to tell the story again quickly.  My nephew, Carson, he loves his football.  He's been playing football since he was four or five.  Ridiculous.  And a couple years back, I went to a game and his team, he was finally on a good team. 
[00:48:00]  I've seen him play where he was on a shitty team where they were like three and eight  for the year or whatever.  Four and, well, you know what I'm getting at.  But this particular team, they were really good.  They've only lost one or two games, right?  And I go to a game.  I get to go to one or two a year.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, why are they sitting everybody?  And my brother Scott goes, oh, you see, if they're up by 20 points, you've got to sit  the offense, the starters, to give the other team a chance to come back a little bit. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, what does that teach?  Because then what you're going to do is purposely let the team score so you can get your guys  back in.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Why would you do that?  That's not the game.  Instead of doing some, you know, parenting, which isn't easy.  I'm learning that.  Parenting is not easy.  That's exactly it.  It's not easy.  You're going to have to sit down your kid and go, look, man, you know, maybe football's  not for you or, you know, it wasn't your day.  Right.  But you'll have another day and hopefully you'll do better next time.  It happens. 
[00:49:00]  They sit the offense if they're up by too much.  What the fuck is that about?  How about you just got the shit kicked out of you as a team and a much better team beat  the shit out of you and it is what it is.  Right.  Deal with it.  And that happens and it's going to happen throughout life.  And that's what's scary.  It's going to happen in real life.  You're absolutely right.  Not everyone's going to get the promotion.  No.  But it makes you work fucking harder to try to figure out what you're good at.  But to hear them sit and whine now about, you know, hey, he's got this.  Why don't I have it?  Right.  Well, he worked hard.  He's better at it. 
[00:49:30]  He's this.  He's that.  There's plenty of reasons.  I don't understand why the parents out there allow it.  I guess they have no choice.  Because every one of their kids is special.  Every one of them is so special.  Oh, Christ.  Let me tell you something.  Some of your kids are stupid.  Some of your kids are just stupid.  They're not as smart as other kids.  They're not as talented in sports.  They're not as...  You know, you've got to find your niche.  Here's the story.  Coaches resigned after allowing a youth football team to burn trophies.  Three New Canaan youth football coaches, including the league president, have resigned after 
[00:50:00]  concern from parents and league officials about an end-of-season party last month that  ended in the players burning their third-place trophies.  All right.  So the coaches took many of the players from the eighth-grade black team.  What?  That sounds...  Oh, probably.  I don't know if that means just that's...  I don't know if they were actually black kids or if...  I don't think so.  Not in New Canaan.  Team to Erwin Park for the trophy-burning exercise using at... 
[00:50:30]  Oh, this is great!  Burning exercise, using it as a motivational tool to improve next season.  There you go.  The team had reportedly won five consecutive league championships.  So they took pride in winning championships.  They come in third place, and now they're like, look, we're going to do this thing.  We're going to burn our third-place trophy.  I see nothing wrong with this.  No, this is perfectly fine.  But then you've got the stupid fucking parents.  New Canaan police received an anonymous letter.  It's always an anonymous letter.  Why don't you show your fucking face?  This goes with what Jimmy says with the dumb haters that don't want to show their fucking face. 
[00:51:00]  Anonymous.  Doesn't that make you happy?  An anonymous letter from a parent who was concerned about the incident.  On November 30th, police observed a very small burn spot in the area of Erwin Park where the incident took place.  Police have indicated that no charges are pending, but that the league itself is conducting its own investigation.  I don't know what the concern was.  In a recent email sent to parents, the league's board addressed a concern for the trophy-burning incident.  The parents uniformly were disappointed and upset at this exercise and thought it demonstrated poor sportsmanship. 
[00:51:30]  I'd be all about this, and I would like the match.  It's fine sportsmanship.  It's like fucking...  And an inconsistent message after the players had all been congratulated for their hard work in play.  Yeah, you congratulate them on a good season, but go, look, we can be better next year.  Again, it's like, you did great, just as good as everyone else.  No, you didn't.  The letter stated, according to the Connecticut Post, likewise, carrying out this activity in a town park showed a lack of judgment when the town specifically rules out even small fires. 
[00:52:00]  All right, so there's a problem with the small fire in a park.  Oh, woo, look out.  Could go after that a little bit, I guess.  The coaches involved have resigned, and they were probably really good coaches.  That's the problem.  So now you're going to get one of these doofuses in there that doesn't even understand football.  See if they've got a guy in there that molests the children.  Right, exactly.  But we'll placate to the wimpy parents out there.  They've accepted their resignations.  That's sickening.  And the coaches have been suspended from any further involvement with the program or any individual team. 
[00:52:30]  It's just bullshit.  It's disgusting.  I feel like the dog with the fucking kibble on his nose.  Yeah.  Stay.  Yep.  Stay.  Oh, did you see this?  The players could have cared less, the officials said.  They were over it by the time the party ended.  Yeah.  So it was a thing they did, and they probably really enjoyed it.  No big deal.  In football, there's a tradition of burning the show as a means of forgetting any disappointment in the season. 
[00:53:00]  I didn't know this went on.  And instead focusing on the positive and looking forward to next season.  The coaches wrote in an email to the league's parents.  Unfortunately, we as coaches made a mistake in our attempt to carry out this tradition.  While our message was intended to be positive, and it still is a positive message, by the way,  it was a mistake to carry it out in this way, and for that we would like to apologize.  This lack of judgment on our part should in no way tarnish all of the hard work, sportsmanship,  and success that you accomplished this season and in previous seasons. 
[00:53:30]  So that's an email they sent out to try to save their ass.  They don't believe that.  But why not right there say, hey, you know what?  They said they were sorry.  Right.  Cool.  They've had a great track record here.  Yeah, let's move on.  God.  Fuck it.  There's no, there is no saying, hey, sorry about that.  I fucked up.  And like you said, let's move on.  Let's just get on with it.  Doesn't happen.  You have to step down.  You have to resign.  That's why people are going to lie about stuff.  Yeah.  Why would you ever apologize?  An apology when we were growing up was pretty good. 
[00:54:00]  An apology got you out of some shit, and you were able to continue on with whatever it  was in general.  Because they want to break you down before they fucking kick your ass out the door is what  it is.  Don't apologize for anything out there for the people that are going to get in trouble.  Because it's not good enough for these people anymore.  It's not going to save your ass.  No.  And you don't mean it.  That's just a start.  You're supposed to lose your job and apologize.  Yeah.  Great.  Fuck you.  Especially the people that sincerely apologize for something.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  That was really sincere.  I appreciate that.  But now we need your fucking, you know, your key. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You're done here.  Bye-bye.  Fucking asshole.  Just a bunch of parents who don't know how to fucking accept second place.  It's a stupid world we're in right now.  It's ridiculous.  It is.  And it's horrifying being a father in this world.  But they're hiding their motive.  They're hiding, they're not, they're really making it like it's about their kids.  Mm-hmm.  But it really is about their lack of ability to convey to their kids that coming in second  is acceptable and okay.  That's what it's about.  But they make it like, well, no, the kids, the bullying, the kids. 
[00:55:00]  Fuck you.  You're just not, you, you, make a decision.  If you want to have kids, don't both have careers.  Like, you have to make that fucking choice.  If you try to build a utopian childhood, you're really going to disappoint these fuckers  when they have to go out into the working world where it's just a fucking massacre most  of the time.  So, you know, no bullying in schools, none of this, zero tolerance policies, anything 
[00:55:30]  about comedy and joking inappropriately, political correctness, this, that, that, that, that, that,  it all just fucks them when they get out of this fake world of school and living with  your parents and get thrust into the real world and, and realize, oh, shit, hey, wait  a minute, but you're, you're bullying me.  No, I'm your boss, shithead.  Now get the fuck to work.  Hey, you can't talk to me like that.  Right.  Oh, yeah, I can.  And get the fuck out.  Now you're fired. 
[00:56:00]  They're doing exactly what religion did, just not with the same, uh, vengeance.  But it's the same, they want mindless, uh, assimilation, just mindlessly heeding what  they say.  It's fucking silly.  And what needs to be said, which is really important, it's the minority that's, that's  doing all this.  Oh, Opie, the race has nothing to do with it.  Yeah, that's just rude.  Oh, oh, I gotcha.  It's, it's a, it's the minority of parents, but for some reason, the majority of parents  don't know how to get around this shit.  Cause, I mean, I do talk to enough people and, and like at Carson's football game, the story 
[00:56:30]  I told, you could see the frustration on all the parents' faces.  Like, this is bullshit.  We don't want this, but this is what the league has decided.  Well, they need to be more vocal.  Yeah.  They're not vocal.  I didn't see one parent that day that was like, yeah, this is proper and this is what  should be done.  I'm glad they're doing this.  No, I didn't see that.  I'm glad they're turning my kid into a pussy.  They listen to the complaining parents.  So why do we allow this in, in, in our society, especially in America where it was all  about majority rules? 
[00:57:00]  Cause we don't push back.  That's all it is.  Why aren't we pushing back?  Because we're lazy.  And across the board, we don't push back.  What happens when you hate something, it evokes a stronger reaction.  So you want to go do something and get it done.  Right.  When people just like something, that's great.  It's called apathy.  Yeah.  Apathy is right.  You just go like, ah, whatever.  I'm going to work.  We've been through this too many times to count, but you know, we've got kicked off the radio  and gotten in major problems because of people that don't even listen to the show.  And then the stupid fucking company, you know, listens to this dumb little minority with 
[00:57:30]  the letterhead and knocks these really popular shows off the air.  When, when, if you really pulled the people that actually listened to the product, they  don't care.  They wouldn't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Maybe a tiny percentage, but there would be a massive majority that are like, all right,  maybe they fucked up this time, but I'm still cool with this and really still want to be,  you know, listen, Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton or, or everyone else that's got kicked  off the fucking air.  Something needs to happen where that trend gets broken of little groups of people because 
[00:58:00]  an organization, a group that's willing to organize and send emails, they're the only  voice being heard.  So General Mills, here's 10 complaints.  You're right.  And they don't hear a fucking 5,000, hey, let this go.  We're fine with it.  Right.  10 complaints is all they hear.  They're a bunch of dummies in a product that, well, we don't want our product defected.  Yeah.  Pull the fucking avatar.  They should base it against everybody that uses their product that didn't write in.  And say, okay, we got 10 of these and we got 10 million of these.  And unfortunately, I guess as humans, you know, if you like something, you're not telling 
[00:58:30]  the company in general.  You know what I mean?  But if you don't like it, you can't wait to get on your computer or, you know, write  an actual physical letter and get it in the mail.  Did you ever call customer service and say your product is working well?  No, of course not.  Me neither.  Thank you, sir.  But why are the people in charge don't understand that mentality?  That there's a shitload of silent people out there that really enjoy it.  Because they want it to go back to the way it was the day before.  Quiet.  That's all it is.  They don't want to.  They don't.  They're not performers.  They don't know how to deal with the noise or the fucking headache or the conflict. 
[00:59:00]  They're like, hey, stop.  This is what are you doing?  Go back.  Okay.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Fire him.  Come back.  Come back.  They just want it quiet again.  Fire him.  I'll never forget in our dumb world, you know, me and Ant, because it was before Jimmy, we're in  Boston, and we were trying to make a name for ourselves.  No one really knew Opie and Anthony at this point, but we were, you know, we were picking  away.  And one day, we got on Howard Stern's radar.  We're just a small show in Worcester, Massachusetts, broadcasting to Boston, and all of a sudden, 
[00:59:30]  Howard is talking about us because of some shit that went down, right?  He thought we were ripping him off when, you know, to this day, I swear, it was just a  coincidence.  It's the first of many.  Yeah.  But, you know, he pointed his finger at us and said, we were ripping him off, right?  And I'm like, as a radio guy, I'm thinking to myself, holy shit, this could only be good  for us.  Like, a guy that has a much bigger fucking audience is talking about Opie and Anthony  when the market still doesn't give a flying fuck about us, right?  So, I'm excited. 
[01:00:00]  Ant's excited.  We're talking about, like, holy shit, this is good for our career, you know?  Howard in New York is talking about us.  Dave Douglas, our fucking PD at the time, I'll never forget it.  And he, I think he actually asked me to lunch.  And we're at a dumb buffet.  It was always that stupid Chinese buffet place.  And I'm like, he's going to talk about this.  This is good.  We're going to try to figure out a strategy.  How do we fucking capitalize on this?  He goes, you know, Howard talked about you this morning.  I'm like, yeah, man, that's pretty cool, right? 
[01:00:30]  He goes, oh, no, that's not good at all.  That's just not good at all.  We don't need, we don't want that at all.  And I asked him why, and he never gave me a reason.  I guess he was scared of success or something.  You know, they're cowards, and they don't know how to, they wanted to go back to the way it was the day before.  They wanted to be quiet.  Well, that's why I brought up the story.  When you said that, it popped this memory into my stupid head.  And I remember Dave Douglas going, yeah, this isn't good for you guys with a radio station.  And I'm looking at him, how is this not good?  A guy that has probably 20 times the audience easily as us at the time. 
[01:01:00]  It ended up being good.  Huh?  Obviously.  Well, then what me and Ant did, because we were on our own trip, we were like, okay, we can never fucking listen to this guy ever for real advice.  That was the day I'm like, this guy is useless as far as our careers go if he doesn't think this is good.  Because anybody in radio that mattered, understood, holy shit, if a show that is more popular than he was talking about you, that is good for you in the end. 
[01:01:30]  They're just frightened people, man.  Frightened people get in their own way.  Chris Rock had a, and Patrice was not a frightened guy.  He got in his own way for other reasons.  And Chris had a good thing.  He's making me think of that a lot.  People get in their own way.  Like, all you got to do is just not do certain things and all this great shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And people do that for Patrice, a stubborn guy.  And he might have had, like, a weird thing with success, too.  Because, like, kind of like most of us, he had low self-esteem.  Like, all comics do.  You know what I mean?  We have that fucking self-hating thing, and we sabotage things because we're a little bit self-hating. 
[01:02:00]  But success is scary.  It can be, sure.  I think it's scary.  It can be.  But after all these years, it's like, anything good, I just want it.  Because we're so good and good.  But there was a time.  It was scary.  Are you kidding me?  I'm scared of my shadow to this day.  Yeah.  What's going on with Patrice and Audible in those 16 hours?  Do we know?  Because people are tweeting the shit out of me, and I don't have an answer for them.  I don't have an official day.  Okay.  But it's 100%.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  16 hours going up on Audible in four parts.  And the money goes to the family.  100% of the money goes to the family.  100%.  Yes.  It's going to be four parts.  I think it's $5 per part, so it's not a lot of money.  Well, we're trying to figure it out.  Is $5 too much?  I don't think so.  I think it's okay.  We're trying to push the number a little higher.  It probably should be three, but it's for a good cause.  I mean, you're talking about-  We're thinking we want to go five to get even more money to the family.  Four hours of content per $5.  Yeah.  And-  So the whole catalog will cost hardcore people $20. 
[01:03:00]  $20.  $20 for 16 hours.  But that's going to a good cause.  Yes.  100% of it is going to Patrice's family.  You're donating to charity, and for four hours of material for $5, that's fucking not even  a dollar an hour.  But it's not on iTunes.  It's only-  Because Audible also shows up on iTunes.  This is not going to show up on iTunes, because if it showed up on iTunes, then a little bit  would go to iTunes.  So we wanted to make sure 100% went to the family.  So it'll be up within days exclusively at audible.com.  Hey, Jimmy's playing-  You're playing Queensbury? 
[01:03:30]  I forget the name of the place.  This is Friday, Saturday, yeah.  And as I was driving in, I'm like, whatever happened to Matt from Queensbury?  Remember we used to say that?  Yeah, Matt LaFarre.  And there he is on the Instant Feedback.  I haven't seen his name in a long fucking time.  I always see him up there.  No, I know.  That's why I thought about him, too.  He's a big dude.  He's like a fucking stocky guy.  How fucked up is it that we know so many individual fans?  Yeah.  All the shows just don't know they're fucking fans like this.  Not to fucking pat myself on the back again, but sorry.  You should.  He writes, Opie, look up hurt feelings questionnaire. 
[01:04:00]  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Sam, look it up.  Look it up.  Please.  If it's worth talking about, we'll do it after the break, because we got to eat, motherfucker.  Yeah, I already ate, but I want my friends to eat, too.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on, where's that part? 
[01:04:30]  Crazy kids listened to this when I was growing up. 
[01:05:00]  The punk.  See, we ain't got no swing except for the rain.  Come on, where's that part?  Oh, yeah.  Here it comes.  Jimmy, you do it.  What's that?  This weekend, Friday and Saturday, two shows a night.  Is that it?  Is that it?  No. 
[01:05:30]  Is this the song we're going to let go at some point?  Where?  My throat's too less up for that music.  Where is it?  I don't want to shout.  But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out.  Hello.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Sexy.  Hello.  Something's going on.  And he looks a little more sexy than usual. 
[01:06:00]  Have you seen his new do yet, Jim Norton?  No.  Why are you wearing a hat?  Jimmy has not seen it.  You haven't seen it yet?  Jim doesn't know why he's got the hat on.  Are you lying?  I swear to you.  No.  I left yesterday afternoon.  So you really weren't checking your Twitter yesterday?  No.  He doesn't know what's going on.  I mean, I was checking, but not for...  Are you playing this for the radio?  No.  I'm being really honest.  Ah, shit.  Well, I'll do the sexiest part today.  The Clash released London Calling 32 years ago today.  Before you do what you're going to do, I just want to ask.  You like The Clash yet? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  You did, right?  Yeah.  What were some of your songs you liked?  I liked this one.  Yeah, absolutely.  And then I liked the other one.  You go rock the Casbah, or is that too poppy?  Rock the Casbah.  That's The Clash?  Rock the Casbah.  That's terrible.  Rock the Casbah.  I like that in hindsight.  I actually like that.  I was a train and vain guy, and maybe a little lost in the supermarket.  You know what I like about The Clash?  They're not over-played.  There's so many bands that are like, all right, I heard that a thousand times. 
[01:07:00]  Like, when you hear a Clash song now, you're kind of like, oh, cool.  Yeah, they didn't fucking kill it.  I haven't heard this like last week.  Already, you know?  Well, we got E-Rock in here.  I just want a picture of the hat.  Speaking of clashing.  No, you don't know.  Screw the hat.  What's wrong with your hairdo?  You really don't know what's going on.  No clue.  None.  I'm trying to read you.  I'm being really honest.  I don't have...  Wow, you were busy yesterday.  I literally was...  Ah, motherfucker, no battery.  Ah, but there is this.  Motherfucker.  But there is this. 
[01:07:30]  It's from True Life.  Yeah, it was.  You got it?  I knew that one.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to work.  What's wrong with your hairdo, sweetie?  That doesn't matter.  Nothing's wrong with it.  Oh, fuck this.  Right.  Stupid fucking camera.  Hold on.  Because Jimmy hasn't seen this yet.  Do you not like your hairdo?  Uh-huh.  I like it.  Now, let's remember.  Let's recap.  How old are you, E-Rock?  33.  He's 33.  When did you get married?  Over a year ago.  Over a year ago. 
[01:08:00]  Okay, okay.  That sort of comes into play here.  Jimmy can't wait.  I know.  Look at him just smiling.  Jimmy is what they say, chomping at the bit, Ad.  Yes.  I've never seen Jimmy look like that before.  He's like, could you stop with a small talk?  Because I'm laughing already, because E-Rock, I know, kind of likes it.  It's like, are you wearing the hat because everyone gave you shit?  No, because you hadn't seen it yet.  That's why.  Oh, okay.  Always thinking of the show, that guy. 
[01:08:30]  He really is.  I do love E-Rock.  Are you ready for this, Jimmy?  Sure.  All right.  Let's unveil.  All right.  Sure.  Unveil for Jimmy.  It looks like the dude from Fight Club, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Meat Loaf.  Oh, yesterday was hilarious.  Fat Shady.  Always in the Shady. 
[01:09:00]  It's in a slim shade.  Oh, there were plenty of great fucking ones coming yesterday.  M&M instead of M&M.  Oh, there you go.  Why did you do that?  E-Rock bleached his hair.  Why did you do that?  It just felt like doing it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's really speechless.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's a Richie Rich kind of a thing.  Yeah.  I don't think it's that bad. 
[01:09:30]  I just don't know why he did it.  I personally think you're having one of those slow, nervous breakdowns.  What did you want to think?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, she...  I had a feeling it might be that close.  Are your eyes fucking eyebrows done, too?  They did them a little bit.  Yeah.  Who's they?  I went to her hairstylist.  To your wife's?  Yeah.  She told them that you're her husband?  What did she say?  Hey, there's a guy I know who needs this done.  Yeah, man.  If I was...  I would do that at home, maybe.  I was going to, but she said, no, if you're going to do that, then... 
[01:10:00]  I wouldn't do that.  What am I talking about?  Do it the right way.  Oh, okay.  It's cool.  It's cool.  Yeah.  Blondie.  So what happened?  You went and got it done?  Mm-hmm.  And were you tired from chasing Tom Cruise all over with Wilford Brimley?  It's a Rutger Hauer reference.  So, okay, what happened?  You got it done, and what did she do?  Besides, hopefully, get a lawyer.  No, she said it would take a little while to get used to, but she's fine with it. 
[01:10:30]  Well, the fact that she married a man, and she's living with the fucking bird from the  Snoopy cartoons.  Woodstock.  Woodstock.  Yeah, people can figure out.  That's a terrible work.  Oh, they're calling him Clydesdale Boy instead of Pony Boy?  Stay fat, Pony Boy.  Or Stay Golden Arches.  That was another one.  There were a few good ones coming yesterday.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  No.  I've been talking about doing this for a while. 
[01:11:00]  It's really blonde.  I think it got blonder.  Is that possible?  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Did anyone say vanilla ice cream yesterday?  Did anyone say that one?  Vanilla ice cream.  I think we did most of these, but I'm not sure if we did vanilla ice cream.  Of course, Danny came up with Bulk Hogan yesterday.  A lot of wrestling names.  Bulk Hogan.  A lot of wrestling names yesterday.  What was the other one?  Brutus the Barber.  Cheesecake.  Cheesecake.  Ah, yeah.  Nature Blob.  Ric Flair. 
[01:11:30]  And my favorite was the American Cheese Dusty Rhodes.  Oh, we rock.  You're like a real blondie or something.  Yeah, Chip.  Good one.  Don't get in on this, Chip.  So, there you have it.  Yes, you do.  You, uh...  Oh!  I know what I got.  You know what would look good with that hair?  What?  His brain matter.  Sorry, Eric.  I don't want to see your head get broken. 
[01:12:00]  I, uh...  I love Eric.  Who did this?  Sam?  Yeah.  Sam walked around SiriusXM yesterday.  Oh.  Well, Eric was, uh...  He wanted to show off his hairdo to all the ladies.  I know he's doing it.  Oh, come on.  So, I made him stop so I could record the reactions.  Oh, good.  And the women had...  We got a little montage of the reactions.  Yeah, this is all the girls of SiriusXM reacting to it.  All the ladies.  Wow.  Sexies.  New hair.  All the cougars.  That's absolutely why you did it, right?  For the chicks. 
[01:12:30]  Isn't that why guys do that?  Yeah.  No.  They do it for the girls.  Why else?  Why would you do it then?  That's a good point, eh?  Yeah.  I mean, I understand you're married and everything like that, but some guys that are married  still want to come off as attractive to the girls and stuff.  You look like Pye Fieri.  When you get married, you want to still kind of keep yourself together, but you don't want  to, like, drastically change your look, I don't think, right?  He wants to let the ladies know that there's still some sexy... 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  There's still some smoldering in that fireplace.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Some fire in that belly.  Mm-hmm.  Someone wrote Corey Ham, but wouldn't it be Corey Hamburger?  Uh, Corey Ham, Corey Ham.  That works.  Yeah, I guess.  All right, Brad.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  DC.  All right, here we go.  The ladies at SiriusXM reacting to Iraq's new do.  Julia from XMU.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  You know the sex bagel Eric Nagel, right?  How do these people know you?  I wouldn't know...  Oh, he doesn't know her. 
[01:13:30]  Who is she?  He walks around just knowing people.  That's Sam's job.  You say butterfly, I say pariah.  Yeah.  Sure, sure, XMU.  But I wouldn't know that.  How do you know that?  Oh.  Why would you know that?  Oops.  I love the sex bagel Eric Nagel.  Well, wait till you see his new hairdo.  Show him, Iraq.  Oh, my God.  Why did you do that?  Alex D, producer extraordinaire for SiriusXM Hits 1.  You know, Eric the sex bagel, right?  Of course. 
[01:14:00]  Show her your new haircut.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  She's biting herself.  I am speechless.  What?  What did you do?  In, like, a horrible way?  I don't know.  It's just so different.  Taylor from Wake Up With Taylor.  How do you know this?  I know everybody.  Who's Wake Up With Taylor?  I wouldn't know that person if she had a sign that said, I'm Taylor.  We simulcasted on her show.  We did? 
[01:14:30]  Kenny and me went over there one day.  Oh, well.  Oh, right.  I've never heard of her.  What channel is she on?  She's on Cosmo.  Planet of the Apes channel.  It's Taylor.  I have not heard of Taylor.  She has a raspy voice.  She has Taylor in the morning or whatever.  That's sexy, the raspy voice, right?  No, that's sexy.  No recollection.  Oh, that's sexy.  Look at that blonde hair.  Hey, what's up?  You know what you rock, right?  Sex bagel?  What?  Who?  The sex bagel?  The sex bagel?  Yeah, Eric Nagel.  No, I didn't know you.  The sex bagel.  Have you ever met him before?  Never.  Okay, well, then tell me what you think of his look.  Take off your hat, Eric. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, wow.  You look like...  Are you gay?  Holy shit.  She can hang.  Yeah, yeah.  Taylor's all right.  Are you gay?  Did you like that question?  You look like a fabulous gay man.  That's a great question.  I like it.  That's a compliment.  Yeah, it is.  I like it, though.  I mean, if you're going to go dance in a cage tonight, I like it.  Meet it from the heat. 
[01:15:30]  What do you think of E-Rock's hair?  It's interesting.  You don't like it.  It doesn't match his skin tone.  As a female, do you find him more or less attractive physically?  I don't want to hurt his feelings.  That's the answer.  That's the answer, then.  Sam, I don't.  Yes.  Are you going through it?  What's that, Eric?  I'll answer it for her.  Yes, that would be less.  Wow, Madison from Alt Nation.  You know E-Rock the sex bagel, don't you?  Yeah, he just looked at my tits.  You bet.  It's funny.  Did she look at yours back then? 
[01:16:00]  No, wait.  Is Taylor hot?  She sounds cute with that raspy voice.  She's cute, yeah.  Yeah, she's got that raspy voice.  Is she pretty?  Yeah, she is pretty.  How old is she?  Let's take a look at her.  You got a picture.  Who the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, I know Sam.  Did anyone have a picture up there?  Did anyone have a picture before the bit started?  Right.  We'd have pictures of all these bruds.  How bad do you want to put fucking E-Rock in that hairdo at a table with De Niro as Capone?  Not that I don't love you, because I do, but you know how great that head would look  when a bat hitting it?  I thought you said she was...  Oh, she's cute, man.  The blonde? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  The other girl's kind of cute, too.  Let me see.  Let me see that bitch.  Make it bigger, Sam, before I kiss you on the mouth.  Is that a threat or a promise?  It's both.  Oh, bigger.  It's a thrummas.  Yeah.  So, what are you doing?  You slid it all over.  Oh, no, Sam, what are you doing?  That's the worst.  Wrecking the bit.  Let's keep talking.  I want to see what the girl looks like.  She's pretty.  She likes it where the doo-doo comes out.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  I'd like to ask her.  Her raspy voice is very nice.  It's attractive.  Your voice is kind of scratchy.  It doesn't mean that you like it where the doo-doo comes out.  Dummy used to have one of those voices.  Who's that?  Dummy Moore used to have the raspy voice.  Dummy?  Back in the day.  She's cute.  How old is she?  Yeah.  I think she's probably like 30.  Is she married?  Yeah, she might be married.  Of course.  Why wouldn't she be?  God, am I on a run at dead ends?  Holy fucking shit.  Bad run there, Jim.  I'm like a fucking mouth with Down syndrome trying to go through a maze to get some cheese. 
[01:17:30]  I just keep banging my stupid lunk head.  Lunk head.  Terrible run.  Let's get back to this.  The ladies at SiriusXM looking at E-Rock's new doo.  From Alt Nation.  You know E-Rock the sex bagel, don't you?  Yeah, he just licked at my tits.  You bet he did.  All right, now I'm done.  Well, you remember what he used to look like, right?  Yeah.  Take off your hat, E-Rock.  Oh.  My. 
[01:18:00]  Ah!  What the fuck, man?  Madal from Dirty Dog.  You know E-Rock, right?  Yes.  You know what he looks like, right?  Or what he looked like, I should say.  Yes.  Take off your hat.  What?  What is that?  Why did you do that?  I love the why did you do that.  You bleached it.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan.  No.  No.  Not at all.  I don't even have to squeeze that out of you.  Wow, the ladies hate it.  They hate it all.  They really are.  Not one good one. 
[01:18:30]  That means your wife hates it.  Yeah.  I'm sure she does.  She's just not saying it.  You should have went into shade.  Oh, yeah.  And see what they say about that.  Because, like, literally, they could probably read by you in there.  I showed Jess a picture of Eric last night.  While you were fucking?  No.  Oh.  Do you want Eric to cuckold you?  No.  No.  A blonde cuckold.  Is he the blonde bull that's going to come over?  No. 
[01:19:00]  Okay.  She also absolutely hates it.  Oh, she didn't like it?  She's befuddled by why he would do something like that.  Yeah, there's no reason.  You haven't really given a reason.  Yeah, why?  Well, there really is no...  You used to do highlights every once in a while, but this is...  Something came up a few months ago.  We were talking about...  I don't know if it was on this show or the after show that I used to highlight my hair.  Uh-huh.  But I haven't done that in so many years, and then it just got in my head.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to do it one more time. 
[01:19:30]  And I've never done this before where the whole hair was...  You're having a very early midlife crisis, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you driving a Mustang to?  Hey!  At least I'm on schedule for mine.  I actually didn't even mean this.  No.  Believe me, I've been having a midlife crisis since I turned 13.  Yeah, yeah.  I should have said that.  I met another sports car.  But that's just not like you, Iraq.  You'd be so rash.  I think he's having a nervous breakdown.  I think so, too.  Nah.  It's one of those slow ones, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just creeps up on you. 
[01:20:00]  It's just something to do.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm very aware of nervous breakdown people.  Build a model.  Get a hobby.  Some are really quick, and others are just slow.  You have a slow fuse.  Like, the tide is slowly coming up.  Are you comfortable with your age?  I'm fine.  Yeah.  It's usually, you know, you hit the 30 mark, and it's like, all right, I'm 30.  But I was just 29.  I pretty much just remember 29.  30's nothing.  It's the couple of years after 30 that you start thinking, all right, look, I'm entrenched. 
[01:20:30]  I'm in my 30s.  I'm in my 30s.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And that could be a thing, the marriage thing, which, you know, it doesn't matter how good  it's going or anything like that.  You understand, like, wow, you know, it sinks in that, like, ah, I'm married.  They got a house?  Got a house.  That's a big thing.  Big responsibility.  Big responsibility.  You're not young, free, whimsical Eric anymore.  So it makes you want to just shove your head in Clorox.  Instead of him having a midlife crisis, maybe he's having a mid-weight crisis. 
[01:21:00]  I might laugh at my own shit.  All right.  We think that, um...  Something's going on in your head.  Yeah, the house is a big one.  That's the sign of getting...  Yeah, responsibility.  Yeah, what's up with you today?  I have a little bit of coffee.  You all right?  I'm tired and slept.  I tried to.  I lit on a plan, but I couldn't sleep.  Are you going to have kids soon?  No, I don't know.  Are you...  Ah.  In what way?  Jimmy's running into a lot of dead ends.  Yeah, just nothing for dead ends. 
[01:21:30]  Are the Nagels trying?  I want to know about some of the dead ends.  Are the Nagels trying?  I think once the house is all done.  Uh-oh.  Okay, but you could say, like, then actively trying.  Are the Nagels preventing right now?  No.  All right.  Oh, you pulled the goalie.  Nice.  He pulled the goalie.  So the Nagels are kind of trying.  Consumating.  Are you a pull-out guy or no?  No.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you like to fucking...  Oh, that Nagel seed.  Do you say...  That Prince Nagel seed is running wild.  Running wild. 
[01:22:00]  It's too valuable to be left on a stomach or a chest or a face.  No.  No.  Yeah, do you cry when your semen is wasted on a belly?  Or do you remind your wife...  Humanity cries.  Right.  I'm lucky she just got...  Exactly.  When you're about to come, do you say, I'm going to come, or do you say, get ready for  your gift?  It's a gift from God.  Yeah.  How great would it be to say that?  Girl, get ready for your gift.  Do you...  Are you a laughing?  There comes royalty. 
[01:22:30]  I would think some women out there, that would really turn them on if you actually said  that.  Roll out the red vulva.  Wow.  They pulled the goalie.  Are you a leg pusher backer?  When you're going to come, you push the legs back.  That way, the cum goes nice and deep.  Oh, yeah?  That's what you got to do.  How do you do it with your abs?  That's a good tip.  They just have them fucking triangle themselves up on their face and heels, and downward dog  for yoga.  That's why it doesn't leak out of their asshole.  Troy just messaged me on Gchat and said, Eric used to bleach his hair back in the late 
[01:23:00]  90s.  He's probably doing it because he was cool back in his glory days.  Glory days!  Are you thinking back in your glory days?  Yeah.  Back when you get on a skateboard and it wouldn't break in half.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  There might now.  He just sits there.  What a trooper to walk around, though, and do that.  But he's fucking great. 
[01:23:30]  He just walks around.  He took the hat off.  He didn't give a turkey.  Can you feel it?  But he wants people to accept it.  Yeah.  That feels as soon.  I thought of doing that as a goof because my hair I could just cut off.  Yeah.  I really did think of bleaching my hair just to be silly.  Well, you did the horseshoe for the live broadcast.  Yeah, I would bleach it just to annoy my ex.  I wanted to do it when I was dating her.  Just come home with bleached hair.  What's up, bitch?  I'll fuck you.  Let's all come in after the Christmas holiday with bleached hair.  Really?  No.  Would you do that?  No, I don't think I'd look good as a blonde.  What do you think? 
[01:24:00]  You're a fucking nine as a brunette?  Exactly.  Yes.  None of us are exactly fucking dishy.  Except you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  I used to, back in the day, I would bleach it.  I'd color it sometimes.  What color?  Sexy.  Like, I'd mix in red or green with the blonde.  Oh.  Nice.  That's wild.  For this time of year.  I highlighted once in my life.  Oh, boy.  And I was at BAB, and I had longer hair, and I fucking highlighted it. 
[01:24:30]  Not, it's very subtle.  I went for a little, very subtle, like, you know, I was trying to go for that, what my  hair looks like in the summer type shit, right?  Ah.  I walked into my house, and the disappointment on my dad's face, I went, holy fuck, I'm never  fucking doing this again.  Because that's like old school guys think that's gay, and they don't want their son to be gay  for the most part.  Well, I mean, you're absolutely right.  My dad was from the older generation.  He just missed the Beatles.  He was Frank Sinatra, not the Beatles, which was very important to the people our age. 
[01:25:00]  If you had the parents that were into the Beatles, they were more accepting about a  lot of shit than you did.  But he was Frank Sinatra, so he's like, that's fucked up that my son is putting a little  color in his hair.  That's crazy, because you couldn't even go to, like, the salon to have your hair done.  You went to the fucking barbershop.  Right.  Dad grabbed your hand and said, come on, we're going to the barbershop.  But do you agree, if your parents were more Beatles people, they would accept some of 
[01:25:30]  the shit.  I came home with an earring when it was really popular from college.  Two things.  Yeah.  Those two things bummed him the fuck out.  And I had to try to explain, everyone is doing this.  Yeah.  But he just didn't get it at all.  My mom was a little more cool and liberal.  Because she was Beatles, right?  Yeah.  And my dad was more, you know, that generation.  So he wasn't cool to anything that was kind of new.  Sleepy?  No.  I don't like that at all.  My eyes are drying out.  Yeah.  That's the first time I've never just break down.  Oh, shit. 
[01:26:00]  Lack of sleep.  Why are your eyes drying out?  I don't know.  Were you up all night, just walking wide-eyed, staring at a wall, thinking of murder?  He was trying to write.  He got tired.  He was writing red rum and lipstick on the wall.  I was like, what are you doing?  Travis just got a text message from somebody that called Eric.  I don't think it's appropriate, but they called Eric a bleached whale.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Because he's fat.  Fuck.  Oh.  Damn it.  That's terrible.  Damn it.  What was the craziest thing?  Captain Lou Albino is coming through. 
[01:26:30]  He wasn't even bleached.  Ah, that's funny, though.  Let me ask Jimmy and Ant, and real answers.  What was the craziest thing you did growing up with your look?  Like, I admitted to little highlights, and I did the earrings, stupid thing.  You'd do anything where your parents were like, what the fuck?  I had that ridiculous afro for my whole fucking youth.  But wasn't the big hair in at that point?  Well, up to a point, when I was a little tater with a big fucking afro, everybody thought  it was kind of cute.  Yeah.  And as I got older, it was like, what the fuck is this guy doing? 
[01:27:00]  He looks like that kid from room 222.  You're doing any of the stupid clothes?  Uh, oh, yeah, yeah.  80s was just, uh...  Yeah, but that was the style, so I guess we all sort of got...  When I started dressing myself, I, uh, I, uh, was wearing plaid with stripes, like,  just without a clue.  Fucking pants that were much too short.  Right.  Like, I just didn't know.  I was an idiot.  Jimmy, what'd you do?  Any earrings?  Any earrings?  Fat laces.  No, no, I didn't want any earrings.  No tattoos.  Fat laces.  My Kango hats. 
[01:27:30]  Call him Eric Laces.  My hair.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, I can't look like I'm not.  My hair was so fucking unmanageable that my fucking barber, who I think is gay, Andy,  who would press his big stomach against my arm in some of his sweatsuits.  Oh, a stomach.  What the fuck?  At least fucking push your cock up against the arm.  He couldn't.  Oh, that's why he went with belly?  He was trying.  And when he would comb my hair, it would get long, and he kind of sprayed it back.  Oh, like a pompadour?  Yeah, oh, it looks so bad. 
[01:28:00]  Like spraying it back, he'd comb it back?  I always wanted to comb my hair back like the cool guys.  Yeah, yeah.  With that dumb cowlick.  But I wouldn't wash my hair for three days, because it was so stiff.  Yeah.  It was so bad.  That's terrible.  I couldn't do that either.  Like, Sam can't do it.  It's just one of those, you know, you got that hair.  There's no slicking back.  No.  I remember going to the barber, though, and getting it cut pretty short, and then my father  like taking the brush, and he'd grab you by the face like this and go, come here, come 
[01:28:30]  here, and just brush like real hard.  I was like, ow, ow, shut up.  Stop crying.  Dump the wine.  I'll give you something to cry about.  What an asshole.  He's like brushing my hair too hard.  I don't understand how parents can be assholes.  Eh, it was a time.  That's how parents were back then.  That was a good parent back then.  Yeah.  The bad ones killed their kids.  True.  Roland is begging me to say his joke.  Oh, Roland.  It's a good one too.  Perez Hill ton.  Ah! 
[01:29:00]  Well, see?  Because he's overweight.  Hyphenated joke is always good.  Right.  Because he's hilly as something.  No, it's the ton part.  Cigars and Scotch.  King Kong Blondie.  King Kong?  He's bald.  You're missing the point, ladies and gentlemen.  No, the King Kong is because, you know, Iraq's a bit overweight.  And then the Blondie.  I like it.  He went a different direction with the whole thing.  King Kong Blondie wasn't bleach blonde.  No, no.  It ties in with the wrestler, but not the hair.  Right.  Yeah, but Brutus the barber didn't have blonde hair. 
[01:29:30]  He is now, so it still counts.  You need some blonde-haired wrestlers.  Right, you need a bleach blonde.  That's why Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes.  Yeah, that was.  Paul Kogan.  Oh.  Right.  Oh.  Dusty Rhodes.  Why don't they sweep them?  Oh.  You think Eric's trying to get his wild side out before the kids come?  Of course he is.  He's trying to be a crazy guy.  I'm going to go nuts.  He'll be on the cruise ship running around.  Here's the guy who was doing the conga while I last night.  Yat-da-da-da-da-da.  Chalk up to his hand.  Yat-da. 
[01:30:00]  There's the wild man from Cruise Director.  Going on a cruise soon?  No.  But no vacation.  We missed something here.  He said he's going to try for kids after the house, but they pulled the goalie, so he's  technically trying now.  No?  Every time.  Getting it in?  If it happens, it happens.  Yes.  Oh, that's a good plan.  Not doing that.  Is she ovulating?  Oh.  Is she ovulating right now?  Right now, I don't know.  Do you talk dirty in bed?  Are you a dirty dog?  You suck.  Not really.  Are you quiet?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Do you have a tiny penis?  Oh, Jesus.  I think Eric's probably over six.  I think he's packing.  He's got a lot of balls, like literally.  He's a big bag.  You got big balls?  You got a...  Oh, yeah.  You said something like that while I was out.  I didn't hear it.  No, because when you used to strip down your boxer briefs at K-Rock to get on the stripper  pole and get on the scale.  Sam said you had big balls.  You could tell.  You had big balls.  You got big, heavy balls.  As big as Jonathan's bulge?  No, no, no, no.  Jonathan's bulge is much bigger than Eric's or any of ours.  Jonathan is giant across the board, I think.  He's got a huge bulge.  He's got a big fucking piece. 
[01:31:00]  But like Eric, when he stripped down into his underwear, you could see his heavy balls  kind of waving back and forth.  Heavy balls.  You got big, heavy coconut balls?  Yeah.  Cum-filled gifts.  Cum-filled gifts.  Seed.  Yeah, they're like fucking click clacks, but they're full of cum.  Like your Vaz Deverns is really thick to get all that cum shooting out.  You probably have very thick, like giant veins in your dick and balls to get all that 
[01:31:30]  cum out fast.  It's got to feed the monster blood.  It's like a tube of toothpaste and you step on it.  Shook.  Really big balls.  I do all right.  That's what I thought.  What does that mean?  So you're quietly fucking?  I'm not really a talker, no.  God, I'm so vocal.  Do you talk dirty?  Do you talk dirty talking?  Yeah, a fucking man talks a little dirt.  But I mean, are you comfortable doing that?  Like you like to be vocal.  Yeah.  If it's fitting.  I love it.  You know, I'm not going to go out of character. 
[01:32:00]  What do you mean?  Yeah, motherfucker, I'm fucking you bitch.  No, I don't mean that.  Like I want to do that or, you know, I just talk like myself.  Yeah.  A little whisper.  How about daddy stuff?  Would you do that?  No.  That is just fucking creepy.  I disagree.  What?  No, I'm not daddy shit.  That's really kind of creepy.  I love that shit.  Really?  Fuck yeah, man.  The fact that we're usually the same age.  Yeah, I don't think it's abnormal, but I'm not.  Yeah, I never.  Nah, not really.  It's not a requirement for me.  Like I don't need to do it.  Right.  But like if a girl likes. 
[01:32:30]  Some girls like that shit.  I guarantee a bunch of guys just went fuck yeah out there, but not me.  Oh, no.  Yeah, be daddy special, girl.  Really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Jesus.  What's special about that?  It's a secret, stupid.  That's incestuous.  Exactly.  It's fantasy shit.  Gameplay.  Yeah, of course.  And role play.  You want to share a little secret with your special girl.  It's getting weird now.  What?  Like it's a daughter-father thing?  No.  Like it's fucking...  It's Belushi and Ackroyd from Neighbors. 
[01:33:00]  Not at all.  We're Buzz Aldrin and fucking Neil Armstrong on the moon.  That's right.  Show NASA how you suck it.  That's fucking less offensive.  I want to have like a little secret while Michael Collins is on the other side of the moon.  Imagine if as soon as the ship disappeared, they jerked each other off.  Like they couldn't leave.  They ran up into the module to suck each other's... 
[01:33:30]  As soon as the ship cleared the mountain, they were sucking each other's dicks in the module.  Oh, fuck.  Is that a great visual?  Tranquility Base.  We're going around the dark side of the moon for LOS.  We'll see you in about a half hour.  Roger that.  Okay, look.  Take this fucking spacesuit off.  How quick can we get these fucking things off?  I'll suck your cock first.  And Buzz was complaining because he loves his ass eating, but Neil wouldn't do it because 
[01:34:00]  he was sitting in a chair for three days.  For fucking a quarter million miles.  Yeah, cutting gassers and fucking tang farts.  He didn't want to lick his ass with tang farts.  But he normally would lick his ass?  Oh, yeah.  It was a goof.  But yeah, I like that dirty talk like that.  It's fucking hot, man.  I don't know.  But again, it's not required. 
[01:34:30]  I don't have any that's required.  I hate when those Hispanic girls are like, oh, poppy.  I don't like that either.  Poppy.  It's like, really?  Poppy?  I don't like that either.  Pop.  I don't like poppy.  No?  I like it's...  Does she call you Daddy?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  You hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do we got here?  Dada is even hotter.  Dumbstick.  I don't call for that.  Dada.  That's creepy.  Oh, yeah.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  We should break, unfortunately. 
[01:35:00]  Wow, that's so weird.  These stupid commercial reads are killing us.  Tis the season.  I mean, we love our sponsors, don't we, guys?  Oh, of course.  But they are getting in the way.  We got a break so we can do some live reads, I guess.  Oh, yes.  You rock.  Thanks for the hair thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, you rock.  Good job.  You don't say anything in bed?  I feel weird doing that.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I just don't feel comfortable.  But you...  Because it sounds so phony if I do it.  You know?  Because I'm not normally like that.  So if I do it, it sounds forced and it sounds stupid.  But when you're going to come, do you say anything or no? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, I'm going to come.  Just the announcement.  Yeah.  It's happening.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is like the Long Island Railroad.  It's either Port Jefferson or you're going to come.  Could you, for the show, homework assignment, go, you know, here comes your gift and see  how she reacts to that?  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Don't tell her, though.  She doesn't listen.  If you're getting...  And this is not even with your current wife. 
[01:36:00]  Just you as a sexual being.  When you would get blowjobs, would you talk to the girl while she sucked your dick?  No.  What do you do?  What do you hum?  Stare her stare.  What do you look at her scalp?  Just look at her.  You don't pull it out?  Fucking rub it on her face?  No.  Well, it's wet with her spit?  Then kiss her?  And then put your dick back in her mouth?  What are you doing?  What are you fucking moping around up there?  Moping.  You're missing a few steps. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You just sat doing a plume?  Just stare at her dandruff?  Don't compliment her on her technique?  Yeah.  You grab her hair a little bit?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You do that, but I don't say commentary while it's going on.  Wow.  You're sucking that like a champene.  A champene.  Oh, you rock.  You drag her around the room by her hair or anything?  No.  You spank?  You spank her?  I tried that.  Oh, you paused.  I tried that.  And she laughed at you?  And this is where it got awkward, because she said, don't do that, because it was just 
[01:37:00]  after you were trying to show me on the air here how to spank a girl.  And I was doing your technique, and she freaked out.  And she said, stop that.  I know who taught you that.  Oh, that's cool.  Anything worse when you try a move, and they're like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  I don't watch that.  Why are you spanking me?  What are you doing?  You don't want to spank the asshole itself?  That's always awkward.  But you rock.  Oh, stop.  Of course.  You rock yells, I'm going to come. 
[01:37:30]  And she yells, I can't breathe.  I think it's going to be on top.  All right, let's go.  We've got a break.  I want to talk more.  Oh, we'll get back to you, Rock, about sex.  Yeah, all right.  We can do that.  Also, Hulk Hogan is suing everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The audio's great.  We've got to get to that today.  And they're trying to make it illegal to text and drive, which is a good thing.  Yeah, but they don't want you to be able to talk hands-free, either.  Yeah, I know.  There's problems with this whole thing.  We could discuss that as well.  Stay there.  Yeah, I'm going to come. 
[01:38:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'll be at Anthony.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.  Because we're as cold as the Ice Road Truckers.  And when we come to your town, the shit goes down.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  We're sick, sick, sick fucking puppies.  Fuck it up, you're a tree. 
[01:38:30]  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Cell phones.  How do we feel about this?  We'll buy them with something.  Yeah.  Chip's laughing.  I like imitating Chip.  Drivers and cell phones don't mix. 
[01:39:00]  Say the feds.  They don't.  And they don't.  I got to agree with this.  Cell phone drivers.  And I've said it before.  Sometimes, in some cases, worse than people that have been drinking.  Not hammered drunk driving down the street the wrong way.  But if you've had a few beers, you are going to drive better than somebody that is on their fucking phone, dialing, texting.  Let me up what you just said.  Not sometimes.  Always.  Yeah.  Because when you're driving, you know when someone is fucking around with their phones. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  And in a lot of cases, you don't see the drunk driver.  No, especially the buzzed driver.  The really bad one.  You're over the limit.  You're over a .08, let's say.  Right.  You're a .09, a 1, whatever.  But you can usually make it home if you're kind of good at it.  But on that cell phone, I've seen people weaving completely out of their lanes, almost hitting the retaining wall, the center divider, almost hitting a car in the lane next to them, doing anywhere between 20 and 70 miles an hour. 
[01:40:00]  And then right when you go to pass them, you've got to look and see what the fuck is wrong with the guy.  And there it is.  Fucking cell phone, either texting, dialing, or it's up by the ear.  I really don't do it anymore.  I used to do it.  Became a father.  Don't do it.  But the other thing that stopped me was moving to my Droid, where you can't feel the buttons.  With my BlackBerry, I was able to get some shit done.  I knew where the letters were on the keyboard, Ant.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't do that with a... 
[01:40:30]  No, so you have to look down a little more when you have the Droid or the iPhone, and that prevents me from texting.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe I decided to turn over a new leaf.  It just became harder in my world.  It's just harder to do it, yeah.  So I just don't do it.  And then, you know, you throw a kid in the mix, then you kind of start thinking a little smarter, I guess.  But they want to ban the hands-free shit, too.  Yeah, it's just dumb.  And the cell phone companies are saying, look, before we start getting crazy here, there's things we could do.  You know, put some chips in the phone.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:41:00]  Did I just do that?  Damn it!  Damn it!  I knew right before the word even came out, I knew that was going to happen.  But they're going to put those things in the phones where if the car is moving at a certain speed, I guess, it shuts down your phone.  What?  That's crazy.  What if there's an emergency?  But that was one of the things they were considering.  I remember that.  But that's insane.  Let's see you're being chased by somebody.  You're trying to find a cop.  Right.  And, you know, you're trying to call 911 and your phone shuts off.  I think that was one of the things they were at least talking about. 
[01:41:30]  You'll probably be able to dial 911, by the way.  Yeah, maybe emergency.  And I think hands-free should absolutely be okay.  Do you ever have a problem when you're talking hands-free and driving?  Never.  No.  I don't think I have.  I'm jerking off, usually.  See, with my Escalade, all I have to do is press a button on the steering wheel and then say, I go like, Jim Norton.  And then it'll be like, dialing Jim Norton.  So I don't even have to touch anything.  Right.  And then I just talk into my car. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  But to have the little Bluetooth on your ear and then the phone, what does that entail, like, hands-free?  Do you still got to dial the fucking phone?  Is it voice activated?  What do you got to do?  What do you got to do?  Help me out here.  I don't understand this new technology.  I don't know.  My hands-free got fucked up.  And, of course, like everything else in my life, I haven't gotten fixed up.  Just haven't fixed it up?  No.  So I don't know.  I guess I used to have to, yeah, do it on my phone and then it would pop up.  The second you have to dial a fucking phone, you are a hazard. 
[01:42:30]  You're a torpedo.  But isn't, you said it earlier, isn't Siri, like, making it a little easier to not look at your phone?  Siri makes it easy.  You still have to, you know, you got to look down at some point to get to the text and then get to Siri.  But I've done it a few times where I've pressed the button and been like, hi, Kenny.  Going to be five minutes.  And then just, you know.  People also like checking their Twitters and their Facebook while they're driving.  That's insane to me. 
[01:43:00]  But they like doing it.  No reason.  And I was thinking the other day, I was driving out to Long Island.  Why don't we have the technology where you can just listen to your tweets, let's say?  Oh, you can, yeah.  I can't do that.  I think you can do that.  Let me see.  We're all sending you to go, you know, I want to listen to my Twitter as I drive.  And, you know, just read all the tweets coming in.  Do you really want to hear Twitter?  Well, I guess.  You suck.  What do you guys do?  You fucking suck.  Do you really want to hear that?  You guys.  Well, what do you love for free speech now? 
[01:43:30]  I want to read these assholes.  I think most people are just fed up with that, too.  I've noticed a trend.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, I could, oh, that's a lot.  People have had with those assholes.  They're fighting back.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  Can you read, can you have your phone read your tweets in?  Let me see.  Because that's what they really should focus on, the cell phone companies immediately, because  the feds are on your heels. 
[01:44:00]  Get some shit out there where it, you know, it totally goes hands free as far as texting  and getting text messages.  You know?  Yeah.  Let's.  Hmm.  No, I don't think, I don't think.  Because Siri, that's the first, that's the first phase that just came out.  So that shit's going to get way better, you got to think, in the coming months.  Yeah.  Who's pushing this shit?  Probably Apple.  They're probably behind it, because they have the best voice technology.  They're behind it.  Yeah, they do.  No, it's just asking me to talk.  I could do emails.  What did that bitch want?  Or I could do texts. 
[01:44:30]  But you still got to push something on your phone to get that going, right?  Yeah.  Let me see if I could do a text here.  Let me see if I could read a text.  What do you mean read a text?  Like have it read a text.  That's how we get the knowledge.  I know, but maybe not.  Let's see if we can do it like this.  I'm going to do a text.  All right.  I know I can.  Oh, this is disappointing.  Indeed. 
[01:45:00]  What?  You got it?  No, my love.  How did you get it?  I'm turning on my...  Yep.  Hi, baby.  Kids, it's figuring it out.  Oh, is it?  No.  Slowly.  No.  Come on.  It's supposed to read it, I think.  It's not doing anything.  I've had it do that, though.  Like, I've read fucking texts. 
[01:45:30]  I just don't remember how to do it.  No.  I'm an asshole.  I wanted to read one of Kenneth's.  You have such a great body.  I love that V.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ.  What?  What?  I just got a text.  So you're all for this?  Well, you know what?  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm all for this, but I think there are...  What about banning phones completely from the car? 
[01:46:00]  They usually start with something outrageous, and then they'll get something in between, right?  No.  I kind of like the idea of...  And it's not that I'm into big government, you douchebag.  It's this affects me.  This affects me as far as I'm driving.  If some ass fuck is swerving across traffic because he's texting, you know, that isn't me going,  Yeah, I like big government.  I just don't like an asshole plowing into me in his fucking car.  You know that someone died, they had a whole piece on this on one of the channels before 
[01:46:30]  we started broadcasting this morning, and someone actually died, and the guy had a...  They're getting a lot of these kids together that actually did the texting to the person  that ended up reading it and dying it, and one guy actually said, and I'm sorry, but  it made me laugh.  He goes, all I texted was LOL.  Can you imagine you're dying because you're reading someone's LOL text that they sent you?  How worthless is that?  Next thing I know, she was thrown through the passenger window over an LOL text. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, fuck.  Hey, cry me a fucking river.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  That's my new character.  Guy who's had enough.  Guy who's had enough.  Why do you have to slouch to do the character?  That's who I am.  It's good.  It's like, hey, I've had enough.  Yeah, these kids with their phones.  Fuck them.  Cry me a fucking river.  Hey, there's their phones.  Hey, there's their phones.  Hey, there's their phones.  Cry me a fucking river. 
[01:47:30]  Cry me a river.  That's not going to get old.  No, no, no.  I think, you know.  You know what's not going to get old?  That little punk who was texting.  Cry me a fucking river.  Yeah, it was LOL.  That's what you get, punk.  I give less than a shit, my friend.  Less than a shit.  Less than a shit.  How is that possible?  I give just a little piece of the shit.  This is so stupid.  Characters run out of steam.  MSNBC has Person of the Year, Time Magazine, Person of the Year announced, it's the protester 
[01:48:00]  is Person of the Year.  That's time to be too cool.  But they're showing, and then it says the Occupy movement expands.  It's not the Occupy protesters.  It's protesters, the people from, you know, Egypt last spring, and Syria, and Libya, and  then you could throw in the Occupy people, but it's not, you know, and guarantee these  Occupy people are going to be, we're the cover of Time Magazine.  It's not. 
[01:48:30]  It's the protester.  You just completely turned me, because I was ready to go, time sucks, but that makes sense.  It was the year of the protester, not just the Occupy.  Yeah, you're absolutely right, man.  So for them to be like, even on the news, showing it like the Occupy movement gets recognition.  No, they don't.  I think the Egypt thing was way fucking bigger.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That shit was unbelievable.  That and Libya, too.  Libya's huge.  They fucking oust a leader that's been in there for fucking ever, since Reagan years. 
[01:49:00]  You know, Hitler was one of the men of the year on Time Magazine.  Let's go back and talk.  So that kind of takes a little out of it.  Newt Gingrich was 1995?  Newt, 95, man of the year.  And he looks exactly the same.  Man of the year.  Then we got the Pope.  Wait, wait, wait.  What year do you want to start?  Let's do the last 20 years.  Start in 91.  91.  All right, so 91 was Ted Turner.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  Remember him?  Ted Turner. 
[01:49:30]  What's that?  It's CNN's Ted Turner.  Remember him?  Yes.  Holy fuck.  I forgot all about Ted Turner.  History as it happens.  I guess because of the way CNN brought that news to the world as it happened.  True.  That was very innovative in 91.  So that's 20 years ago we started getting our news quicker.  Yes.  Bill Clinton in 92?  They're 92.  Nice.  All right, who do we got?  I like the Bill Clinton.  Are you paying attention?  Did you like the Bill Clinton?  Jim spilled.  Yeah, but if something happens in an emergency situation where Jim spilled, you still have 
[01:50:00]  to keep on the ball of what you're doing.  I'm here.  How about a napkin so I don't burn the place down?  Burn the place down.  Did you like Bill Clinton?  You know what?  At the time, I didn't like Bill Clinton all that much.  I didn't hate him as much as other presidents.  But, I say but, and then Jimmy's butt made a noise.  I thought I was talking to it again.  I'm the fart whisperer.  Whish!  Whish!  But, I think history has kind of given Bill a pretty good legacy. 
[01:50:30]  Okay.  Past the blowjob thing, you know.  Okay, sir.  93, Nelson Mandela, F.W.  Yasser Arafat, and...  And Yitzhak Rabin.  This is the peacemakers.  Wow.  They kind of got that wrong.  Yeah, they still don't have that peace thing figured out, huh?  No.  And, uh, look at that.  Fucking Yasser's gone.  He's dead.  Yeah.  Rabin got shot.  Itzhak Rabin. 
[01:51:00]  You did.  Got shot.  Nelson Mandela.  What's he up to these days?  Going through a horrible divorce, I think.  Yeah, that Winnie Mandela.  What a fucking vicious woman she was.  How about you give him a break after what he's been through?  Winnie?  She was crazy.  Was she nutty?  She's the one that we used to fucking, uh, have those, take those tires, and with people  that didn't like her point of view, she'd take tires and fill them with gasoline and  put them around the people's necks and light them on fire.  I've seen footage of that.  Crazy.  No way. 
[01:51:30]  Crazy.  All right, keep going.  93, 94, the Pope.  John Paul II.  Why?  What did he do?  He was the Pope.  I don't know.  He was like a, he was an uber Pope.  He's Popin'.  What did he do, apologize for, and of cardinals or whatever that weren't sending fucking pedos  out of their district?  He was Cole Popin'.  Oh, okay.  Something.  Popin' up in this house.  Popin'.  Motherfucking hell.  Stole Cole.  Motherfucking hell.  Luke Gingrich, 95.  95.  Damn.  Uh, AIDS researcher David Ho in 96.  Isn't that funny? 
[01:52:00]  Do we know anything about David Ho?  A Ho is doing AIDS research.  It's funny.  Do we know anything about David Ho?  Yes, and the year after that, Larry Polyps was a cancer researcher.  We're pathetic.  We don't even know this guy.  Ah, well.  Oh, well.  I guess it didn't work out.  Uh, 97, Intel's Andrew Grove.  Yeah, oh, well.  All right.  98.  Why did they change it to person of the year, by the way?  98.  Still man of the year.  98.  Uh, yeah, I know, because the women, you know. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Men of the year, Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr.  Remember?  Butting heads over the, uh, that whole, uh, uh, they were trying to impeach him.  On the trip.  And, uh, remember that pig?  Now, that whole thing was over, um, what, which gate was that?  That was, is that, um, um, um.  Cock gate?  Cock gate?  No, it wasn't cock gate.  Piggy gate?  Because of her?  Uh, no, it wasn't Stargate.  Uh, Lewinsky gate.  No, it wasn't even Lewinsky gate.  Open the gate.  It was the other gate they had. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, it was Walter gate.  No.  It was about some fucking, no, it wasn't Watergate.  Whitewater.  Yes.  Whitewater gate.  Whitewater thing.  Well, that was Hillary's thing.  Sean the producer gets that one.  Very good.  Why isn't he working for us?  Thank you, sir.  Well, that's all right.  Sorry, sir.  Uh, you weren't supposed to hear that.  There's more than me here.  All right, let's go.  Oh, well.  99.  99 Jeff Bezos.  Oh, Jeff Bezos.  Shit.  And it went to person of the year in 99 for the new millennium of pussiness. 
[01:53:30]  What did this, uh...  Amazon.  What do you do, character?  Amazon guy.  Oh, it's Amazon?  Amazon guy.  Yeah, I told you.  And what a gay.  All right, let's go to 2000.  2000.  Wait, what?  Oh, they did person of the century.  Einstein's a good choice.  Alvin Einstein.  Why is he a good choice?  Of course.  Because he was a nerd.  I would have went Babe Ruth.  Uh...  Person of the century?  You know what? 
[01:54:00]  He was a good baseball player.  I would have...  I absolutely think I would have went Adolf Hitler.  Whoa.  I think he did more to change the face of the 20th century than anyone else in the 20th century.  But did he, though?  Like, more than Mussolini?  Yes.  Or more than fucking Isaac?  Or who was it?  I dropped the H-bomb?  He made the rest of the world take that next step in technology and morality and just... 
[01:54:30]  He really did.  Believe me.  Not praising the gentleman.  But I am saying he had an effect on the 20th century that I don't think any other single person had.  I think Einstein...  I disagree.  I think Einstein was a good choice.  Yeah, but what did Einstein do?  You know what, Einstein...  It had something to do with family.  It was the theory of relativity.  Yeah, but let me tell you something.  Einstein became very popular because of the letter he wrote to Roosevelt about the need to have an atomic bomb  because he thought the Germans were already developing the atomic bomb. 
[01:55:00]  So, again, Hitler comes into play even on fucking Einstein's dying.  But what Hitler did is...  Einstein's dying.  Hitler's going to be a blur, a blip.  Even though a terrible, terrible blip.  Oh, I don't know.  Look, you still look at Genghis Khan.  No, no, no, but I mean...  And they're horrible periods.  But what we learned from Einstein changed everything.  Like, it's going...  It continues.  It's going to change the way you live forever as a race, as a species.  I think we're looking at the same type of effects, but on opposite ends of the spectrum, you know? 
[01:55:30]  Like, I think Hitler will always be looked at as what man's potential for evil is.  Right.  Greater than the man himself, you know what I mean?  Thanks.  And I think Einstein's the same way, you know, greater than his self, his name itself.  Einstein conjures up more than just the man.  Right.  It's his beliefs and his theories and everything else.  And Hitler's the same way.  It's... 
[01:56:00]  It's...  He...  He's the...  The whole fucking evilness of what men can do to other humans.  But he was just...  Yeah, he was.  And he was the leader of the Third Reich.  You know, I'd still give it to Einstein.  I think he's a more enduring human character.  I gotta...  I gotta give it to Hitler on this one, Jimmy.  We gotta agree to disagree.  And I'm going Babe Ruth.  And he's going Babe Ruth.  I gotta go Babe Ruth.  A guy that...  A little fat man that ran around the bases in fast motion.  How the fuck he hit all those homers and he wasn't even in shape. 
[01:56:30]  And yeah, he was a fast motion baseball player.  Yes.  We don't have those anymore.  You ever see him?  Ran pretty well for a fat man.  2000.  Person of the Year.  Rudy Giuliani.  Rudy!  Wait.  What happened to 2000?  That's 2001, obviously.  1990.  That was 2000.  It said 1999.  But Person of the Century was 2000.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Oh!  Yeah, Rudy for the whole...  2001, I would gather, yes.  America's way.  And people forget that a lot of fucking New Yorkers especially hated Rudy Giuliani in the year 2000. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, 2000.  September 9th.  Yeah, he turned...  2001, he was hated.  He turned that shit around, man.  Yes.  But he was a damn good leader during that...  September 10th, he was kind of hated, too, I guess.  No.  He was a damn good leader during that time.  Holy fuck.  Let's go.  2002, the whistleblowers.  Oh, these are the ones that...  That they hooked up with that guy, Fred Whistle?  I knew you'd fuck.  That was hilarious. 
[01:57:30]  What did they blow the whistle on?  Who were the whistleblowers?  One of them's from Enron.  Oh, yeah.  This is when big corporations started showing their...  Yep.  Their ills, yes.  Yep.  From the FBI and from world.com.  2003, person of the year.  Oh, yeah.  The American soldier.  The American soldier.  Oh, yeah.  Put in harm's way and remaining there for quite some time.  Our boys are coming home by Christmas, huh?  So it's literally happening right now, huh?  From Iraq.  No, I know.  I think Afghanistan's still going to have some people over there. 
[01:58:00]  But, yeah, Iraq.  And they're talking about a lot of hotels are going in.  American hotels are going in.  And in the northern Kurd regions, they want to start building hotels so people can take  vacation in Iraq.  And because, I guess, geologically, it's huge.  And historically, a lot of people will want to go there and check it out.  I guess the northern region...  Iraq, nice to me?  What you saw?  No.  Old desert?  Yeah, it stinks. 
[01:58:30]  It's awful.  If you're Indiana Jones, let's say, you might want to go.  The whole Middle East stinks.  Yeah.  You just have Dubai.  I'm like, this is Dubai.  I don't want to go to Dubai.  In Egypt, they got all those old statues.  Knock them down.  Get them out of the way.  Build some nice stuff.  We got a friend that lives in Dubai.  I got an open invite.  How do I figure that out?  Just book your affair and go.  Take that bucket.  You know what?  And if you're going to go, Emirates.  Take that fucking Emirates jet.  Let's do this.  Where you just lay down.  You have a bed.  Can I do it in a weekend?  It's like a private cabin on a plane. 
[01:59:00]  I want to fly first on Emirates with miles.  Jonathan can fly.  Crazy.  I want to stay in the Burge Tower.  Me and Jonathan are going to go.  Because that guy Saad lives there.  So let's all go together.  Because I got a friend there.  Who's your friend?  Cost an arm and a head.  They cut your head off there.  He's the guy we met here once in a while.  He might be CIA.  I'm not supposed to say that.  Probably a pornographer.  He's got a very suspicious job.  Can I bring a gun?  Very suspicious.  I bet not.  He gets a lot of time off. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  All of a sudden he's in Australia.  Then he's in New York this weekend.  And I'm like, when do you get to work?  He goes, I am working.  Well, what do you do?  What is it?  I do this thing.  What thing?  This thing.  Something's going on.  I took a train from Philly with this guy.  Yeah.  Because I had to get back.  My wife stayed down there with the kid.  And he was coming to New York because of his thing.  And all of a sudden we walk up to the Amtrak ticket office.  And they go, hi, Mr. Blank.  Good to see you.  And I look at him like, how the fuck they know that? 
[02:00:00]  Halfway through the trip, did he go out the window and climb on top of the train?  Right.  But I'm like, he didn't show any ID.  He walked up.  And they said that.  So you explain that one to me.  That doesn't usually happen on the train unless it's hello, Mr. Ferguson.  I had to get a ticket.  It's his neighbor?  Exactly.  It would be some kind of innocent thing.  He's wearing a shirt that said, hi, my name is in a name badge.  I had to get a ticket.  He had a ticket.  And they said right in front of me, hi, Mr. 
[02:00:30]  Maybe he was just there.  No.  No, we got a ride to the train station.  You had a ticket to ride?  I had a ticket to ride.  They don't care.  What is that about?  Logically, what could have it been?  Maybe they're queer offs together?  Could be.  Could be.  Lovers.  Yeah, maybe they fucking go to the rest area and masturbate each other in the shrubs.  That's what it was.  I'm trying to think of some deep government thing.  Turns out, like everything else, gay sex. 
[02:01:00]  Right, always.  All right, let's go.  2003, The American Soldier.  2004, George W.  George Walker.  2005, Bono, Bill, and Melinda Gates.  I didn't know it was Bono Gates.  He's the middle.  He's the cuck.  Nah, he fucks Melinda Gates while Bill watches, right?  Bill's tied up in the corner.  He probably gives it. 
[02:01:30]  Bill's tied up.  I bet he cream pies the wife, and Bill has to come over and clean out the cream pie.  He has to drink the cream pie.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Very few things gross me out sexually, but when I see a cummed-in vagina, and they just  zoom in on a dripping, that always creeps me out.  Always.  Yeah, it's a leaky pipe.  I don't like that at all.  Well, I guess from their charitable contributions and whatnot, they give it to the world.  Well, I think the Gates are handing over a lot of money. 
[02:02:00]  A lot of money.  And then Bono, what?  Bono gets the word out to the world.  Yeah.  Hit it.  2006, who we got?  You.  Me?  That's right.  How gimmicky is that?  Shut up.  The person of the year is you?  Why?  What does that mean?  Why?  What was their reasoning?  The information age.  YouTube, and now everybody's a celebrity.  Oh, 2006, huh?  Yeah.  That's only five years ago.  Yeah.  That was for me.  I should take that home and frame it. 
[02:02:30]  See, that's what they're working off for this year, the protester.  See what they do every once in a while?  Yeah.  2006, it was you.  Okay.  Sell shit.  And it's a big computer screen with the word you across.  Why don't they just pick somebody?  Exactly.  I know.  2006, that slow?  Yeah, exactly.  2007.  Vladimir Putin.  Putin.  His big Russian head.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  2008.  Oh, boy.  I.  Barack.  Oh, boy.  Just when we were having fun this morning.  Shit.  Barack Obama. 
[02:03:00]  Why'd you have to show that to Ant?  Oh.  2008, Obama.  Let's go.  Ben.  Oh.  Bernanke.  Oh, okay, sure.  Yeah.  Ben Bernanke.  2010 was Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah.  Facebook guy.  And then 2011, once again, is the protester.  The protester.  Person of the year from Time Magazine.  They should still call him man of the year,  because there was only one broad in there.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So you're just throwing it in there and be polite. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  It's still men.  Exactly.  It's still men rule in this world.  What year was Hitler the man of the year?  Was it like 36, 37?  Why don't you go back there and take a look?  Yeah.  It didn't start on that countdown, but I'll just look at it.  What?  Oh, it didn't?  What did that countdown start?  Yeah.  Where did that start?  83, I think.  What?  Let's go back to 83.  There is Hitler.  Wow.  There he is.  That takes balls.  Is that for man of the year, or is that, yeah.  Time man of the year.  What year is that? 
[02:04:00]  39?  39?  No, 38.  38.  Oh, I was going to say.  He started his shenanigans, as I like to call them.  It came out January 39.  So yeah, 1938 man of the year.  Oh.  And what did they give it to him for?  Being awesome.  You can't just say blue.  I know.  I thought that's.  That was before his shenanigans, so they probably gave it to him for, you know, building up Germany.  Infrastructure?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  Most trains on time.  Getting back to the texting thing really quickly.  Isn't it illegal to text and drive in a lot of places?  It is, yeah.  In New York it is.  Oh, okay.  Already is, yeah.  I was confused.  So what are they trying to do?  Just make it illegal in every state?  Make it federal law, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Get the feds in there.  So they're going to try to get the phones out of the cars.  They're not going to get that, but they will get, you know, texting and driving illegal  in every state, I would assume.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I saw a cop texting and driving the other day.  So we're all doing it.  Why don't you pull him over? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  You're making sense of arrest.  I did that a few times.  The sense of arrest.  Also, really good news, and it's right next to the fucking cell phone thing.  It's just a noise.  It's just a noise us?  It just annoys us.  Ah, you see what they did?  A little play there.  It just annoys us.  A, and then a little fucking dash noise.  Those type of headlines have to make sense both ways.  Yeah.  It just annoys us. 
[02:05:30]  It just, well, it's got the word noise in it.  It's supposed to be annoy.  I get it.  Annoy.  But it doesn't make sense this way.  That's the only way these headlines make sense.  They have to make sense both ways.  Right?  Well, that annoys me too, then.  FCC acts to require broadcasters.  Ready?  It's about time.  To reduce volume on TV motherfucking aids.  Well, it's been like that for fucking how many years?  I'm sick of riding my remote every night.  That's been a complaint for, since TV's been TV. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  And now they're just getting around to where they're saying, hey, we don't like your loud  commercials.  Right.  I hate that.  You're watching a TV show, and it's very quiet.  You can barely hear what the fucking people on the show are saying.  And then it's like, oh, I'll run to bears, the furniture for you.  The local commercials are the worst, too.  Well, they did a little.  $500 cash!  Shut the fuck up!  They did a little study, so they're watching Clueless on E. 
[02:06:30]  Average decibel range about 65.  Yeah.  Do you know what that means?  Yes.  Basic volume.  Okay.  Jimmy will tell you.  And then it goes to the PetSmart commercial.  Maxed that at 87.2!  Oh, God.  And then general car insurance.  86.5!  If you have a structured settlement and you need cash now, call J.G. Wentworth.  Oh.  Make her wait.  It's loud.  It's just loud.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  So there you go on that.  You guys gotta get TVs with smaller speakers.  Oh, is that it?  It's a problem.  Oh, is the surround sound a problem?  You would think that there would be a sound system that...  Because you're not...  I don't think anybody but Sam is listening to sound that's coming directly out of their  television.  Really?  It usually goes through a sound system.  And that system itself would instantly equalize the volume to whatever dB you have it set at.  So why the fuck don't they have that? 
[02:07:30]  I don't know.  And don't tell me they do because I've looked and they don't have it.  They used to make a thing that they targeted towards old people that you could put on the  back of your TV.  What?  And on the back of your TV?  Yeah.  And it would make everything one volume.  How would it work?  I have no idea.  I didn't get it.  Yeah.  I didn't get it.  That's stupid.  I'm sure we're using a quasar though, so don't ask me.  You guys, we got a guideline that this phone call has to be taken immediately.  Okay. 
[02:08:00]  I don't want to spoil for everybody, so here we go.  Sir, what's your name?  Uh, my name is David Berkowitz, the son of Sam.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  So your father's name was Sam Berkowitz.  So your father's an incompetent on a radio show?  Oh, man.  It's you.  I know.  How are you doing, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  Are you impressed that your name's David Berkowitz, I guess?  Uh, no, actually, I, uh, I'm the son of Milt. 
[02:08:30]  Is your name really David Berkowitz?  Yes, it is.  And how old are you?  Uh, 49.  Okay.  I was going to say, you know, no way you were named that after.  What?  Yeah, kind of like the Adolf Hitler, uh.  Did you have a, did you have a tough time when they caught him?  Uh, well, I remember, uh, Jim Jensen saying David Berkowitz, because he couldn't pronounce  a, uh, it was tough for him to pronounce a Jewish name.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  That's funny.  I felt, I felt, uh.  Remember Jim Jensen, of course.  An amazement over the banner headline in the New York Times, and then embarrassment and,  and, uh, anti-Semitism when Jim Jensen just, uh, refused to say it on the air.  Did, uh, now, did you, did you get, uh, phone calls or anything?  I know you were, uh, but a teen at the time, but did you get phone calls?  Phone calls?  Yeah.  You know, a telephone, it rings. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, is that weird thing that you pick up and say hello, and there's a fucking magical  person on the other end?  You know, because when, when things happen like that, people like calling people in the  phone book with the same name and shit.  Oh.  No, no.  Uh, mostly I was, I was in high school, so, uh, and, uh, it was, uh, predominantly diverse.  Uh, so, people just said, that shit is fucked up.  That was his black impression.  That was pretty good.  That was, uh, right on the money. 
[02:10:00]  I didn't think so.  Oh.  You didn't think so, Jim?  It wasn't me, sir.  I didn't say anything.  This guy's confused.  I'm playing chess.  Uh, is this guy auditioning for the most boring caller ever?  Well, he had some terrific stuff to say.  What was the other thing you wanted to bring to the show?  Did you hear what his name was?  No.  What?  David Berkowitz.  Get out of here.  That's right.  That's crazy.  Oh, my God.  Well, that ended up itself, uh, you know.  Why are you calling?  Joel Rifkin.  I'm calling, actually, just to say that, uh, I want to call you.  They're calling you the son of snooze. 
[02:10:30]  Brian Stone rules it up.  I was the worst caller ever, so.  All right.  What, what, what, let's get.  My, my nine-year-old son, when he heard the, the worst of Opian Anthony, said that it  was funny and humiliating at the same time.  Oh, that's how we feel.  Wait, he's been on the show before?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But last time, you didn't tell us you were David Berkowitz?  No, I did.  That's how I, I guess I must have.  And what's your son's, uh, first name? 
[02:11:00]  David?  Uh, Zachary.  Zachary Berkowitz.  Whoa.  Did you think of changing that name because of the bad, uh, connotations on it?  Well, uh, Stephen S. from Bayshore wants to know if you spell your last name with a lot  of Z's.  Is that who, Steve from Bayshore?  It's Berkowitz.  Well, yes.  Berkowitz with ten Z's.  How did Steve from Bayshore get his information into you? 
[02:11:30]  I'm not going to say.  He's here with us.  He just whispers it gaily.  Top secret shit.  Top secret shit.  That's right.  Anyway, I wanted to nominate Pat Cooper for Man of the Year for that performance last week.  Oh, yeah?  That was, uh, did you guys, I know you were talking over him, but didn't, didn't you think  that, could you imagine being at a party, Jimmy, and this guy, like, comes up to you, right?  Yeah.  Like, hey, how you doing?  David Berkowitz.  Oh, wow, that's, so your name's David Berkowitz. 
[02:12:00]  That would make you stop and talk to the guy.  Yeah, yeah, at least it's, that's the worst part.  That's a great story.  You'd actually stop and be like, oh, wow, that's fucked up, you know what I mean?  And then, and then you're standing there, drinking hand, looking around the party as  he just babbles about absolutely nothing.  Sir, how many times have you been standing in a circle at a party, or an oval, and you  begin talking, and all of a sudden, everybody has something to do? 
[02:12:30]  Or like in an airplane when they just, you're at that same party talking to this guy, wishing,  wishing the real-day workers would come in.  Yeah, and just blow everyone's head off.  What do you do for a living, sir?  I have an ironwork company.  An ironwork company.  Yes.  That means you've got some kids.  Berkowitz Iron.  Yeah, that's right, Berkowitz Iron.  Oh, how about that?  Berkowitz and Sons of Sam's.  That's right. 
[02:13:00]  And there's a picture of a dog giving an estimate.  Hey, man, if it improves business, I'll go with it.  Well, of course it does, because you're a nice gentleman.  Rob is reminding us he was on the air two years ago, and we gave him the title of Worst  Caller Ever.  Wow.  I remember this guy.  Really?  I don't remember this guy at all.  It's amazing.  I remember the call.  In two years, nothing's changed.  Ah, that's too bad.  Thank you.  Just die easy, fan.  Kevin from Connecticut says your name is David Lackowicz. 
[02:13:30]  Funny's funny.  We've got funny fuckers out there.  Oh, shut up.  Simply say that I love your show, and you guys cheer me up.  There were a lot of sound effects in his last phone call, I guess.  Matter of fact, they're saying it's on YouTube as Worst Caller in History.  Yep.  All right, David Lackowicz, what are we supposed to do with you today? 
[02:14:00]  I just wanted to ask your opinion of Pat Cooper's performance.  No opinion.  Exactly.  Nothing to say.  Nope.  Nothing to say?  No.  We liked him.  Yeah, no, you should make him a part of the show.  You know?  He's 83 years old.  Okay, okay.  All right, look, look.  Let's stop this call, and let's take you back.  How many years ago is this?  This was December 2nd of 2009. 
[02:14:30]  I don't remember this.  December 2nd, 2009.  Wow.  So we're talking almost to the day.  Almost to the day.  Two years.  Let's take us all back to the first time this guy called.  David Berkowitz call last time and see if he's gotten any more exciting in two years.  God, the fucking, it's got 25,000 views.  Let's listen in.  David, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mr. Berkowitz.  You're very welcome. 
[02:15:00]  You could actually, you could call me son of Sam, or you could call me son of Milt, which  was the only funny joke that, well, I'm talking to three comedians, you might come up with  a better one, since 1977, when I give everybody the opportunity to indulge in that.  He was horrible then.  Wow.  Jimmy, Jimmy just started laughing his ass over the guy. 
[02:15:30]  He was, he was just as bad.  God, how do we now remember this?  You're making a difference.  Berkowitz, you're back on the air live in the year 2011.  2011, yeah.  Well, now I know.  Why did you try the same shit that's on the YouTube fucking thing?  What did I try?  Worst caller in real life.  Do you know you're on YouTube as worst caller ever?  Yeah, my, uh, my kids pointed that out.  But, but you did the exact same line two years later to us.  Did you know you were copying what you did two years ago? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, with the son of Milt?  Yeah.  Yeah, that gem.  Can we hear more of his old call?  Sure.  Yeah, let's, I want to hear his old call.  Fuck this new shit.  Back to 2009.  Stay with me.  Travis, start volume three.  Oh my God, Travis.  Travis is just foaming at the mouth.  What happened?  I don't know.  That reminded me of somebody on a motorcycle and the front tire has come off.  Oh my God.  Please play that again immediately. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you, son of Sam.  Fantastic.  We look forward to your next phone call.  Am I still on?  Yes, you are.  Oh yeah, you're on.  Oh yeah, okay.  Well, anyway, uh, you're talking about the, um, homeless shopping spree and I'm a tremendous  fan of you guys.  And I always loved when you went to the Roosevelt Mall and, uh, you know, you got into all kinds  of trouble and then I think the last year you were at K-Rock, I think you went to the short 
[02:17:00]  health mall.  This is a complete waste of time.  Pat from Monaghi is calling him David Jerkowitz.  And from Neptune, son of shit.  Go ahead, sir.  Finish your thought.  You actually, you have a joke coming?  He's got a good thought.  Go ahead.  Yes.  Well, you know, I, I'll try my best.  I'll try my best.  Why are you calling it?  Well, I wanted to say, well, he's showing the visual of this phone call, which is the 
[02:17:30]  motorcycle, what's the video called again on YouTube?  The motorcycle.  This is a perfect visual example.  It's like Catherine Hepburn on a motorcycle.  It's just called wobbly motorcycle crash.  This is what the Sam guy just did.  He got the visual.  Holy fuck.  Oh, that hurts.  And I want to try to be a comedian and I'm, uh, oh, well, you're making everybody laugh.  All right.  Give us a little something.  Give us a little material.  Go ahead. 
[02:18:00]  Give me a little something, something.  So, uh, you know, when you guys came to short hills, maybe I might reside in that area.  So I was thinking about, you know, Anthony and, um, the, the fact of how there's like  this institutional, everybody says that they're not a racist, not a racist.  But then as soon as I heard that you guys were doing the, the homeless thing,  up at the short hills mall, I went from being a fan to petrified the same, uh, in the same  second.  This is like bringing a, uh, John from Bayville. 
[02:18:30]  Can I just say that watching this video, I feel really bad that the listeners don't have  a visual element right now because it's just perfect.  John from Bayville writes, boar of Sam, Kyle S. from Indiana, David Bercoditz.  Oh, well, the 44 IQ killer.  That's nothing.  Is that any funnier than, than, uh, than all the other jokes?  No, this guy's confused. 
[02:19:00]  John from Houston.  It's not John Wayne.  Go away.  See, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, dumber.  Wait, the summer of boredom is coming in from Tommy and David.  Wait, now, hold on.  Let's give this guy a chance.  Uh, sir, you want to be a comedian.  Yes, Jim.  Yes, Jimmy.  You want to be a comedian.  So give us a taste of something.  What would you talk about?  Well, you, you guys were just coming about, you were just talking about the comsies.  And, uh, another reason, uh, not to get married is because I have the uncomsies. 
[02:19:30]  Uh-oh.  My, my, my wife was finally giving me, it was that time of the decade to get a blowjob.  And, um, I guess that's not funny either.  I said that was still the setup.  He was waiting.  Yeah, that was the setup.  He was waiting for the reaction.  He was waiting for a big laugh.  Sir, let me ask you a question.  Who in your life said to you?  Don't call me sir.  Only when I get pulled over do I get called sir.  It makes me more nervous than I am now. 
[02:20:00]  At least you had a joke for that, though.  Who's feeding you these lines?  Your dog?  Oh.  That was pretty fun.  If there's one bullet left in your gun, I'd have a suggestion.  Jimmy, you said that?  No.  No, sir.  Opie, the one that's not supposed to be funny on the show.  Sir, what?  Opie, the unfunny one?  Yeah, exactly.  Sir, what are you?  That's what I am.  How old a guy are you?  47.  Okay, so you want to do stand-up comedy.  People in your life have told you that you're a funny guy, obviously.  Who's told you that? 
[02:20:30]  Actually, they've told me that I'm not that funny.  Why would you want to be a comedian?  Recently, I've been writing jokes, and I think that they are funny.  Tell me a joke you've written.  Give us some material.  Please.  Oh.  Well, now I'm on the spot.  Yes.  I was writing for my nephew, who goes to college, and he does open mic nights, so I was writing  some stuff for him.  He's a lacrosse player, so it was at the time when Duke had that whole rape problem going 
[02:21:00]  on there.  Yes.  Well, they were raping a few women, and it turned out not to be true.  They only fucked her.  They didn't rape her.  But anyway, I told him, since he's a lacrosse player, of course, I'm nervous now, but...  Is this L-E-S-U-C-K?  Tom Kelly from Westchester, PA, is calling him the Zodiac Killer, but it's a lot of Zs. 
[02:21:30]  That's the only way I can explain that one.  Looks better in writing.  Very good, Tom.  Now, son of Sam, tell us about your observation.  My observation was this, you know, that I told him, since he's a lacrosse player, go  up here on stage, say, say, you know, it's totally not true, these stereotypes about lacrosse  players and athletes, you know, I was fucking this chick, and I finally ripped the duct tape 
[02:22:00]  off her mouth, and she said, I'm not even reporting you to the police.  Wait, don't tell you, is that worse than the wheel coming off of the...  No, we were waiting for the punchline.  Sir, that's worse than 9-11.  It's worse than anything.  We were waiting for the punchline.  We got a little confused there.  No, continue, please.  Continue.  But I'm proud.  Well, anyway, I thought that it was... 
[02:22:30]  Well, you know, they're stupid jokes, you know?  Obviously.  Well, when I said that, thank God for Chinese, you know, because I, as opposed to my true  namesake, I'm actually Jewish, so on Christmas Eve, thank God for the Chinese, because you  can, the restaurants are always open.  And what I love about it is that you can, like, order a one egg roll and put it on your 
[02:23:00]  credit card.  They love those credit cards.  And, uh, that's an observation, not really a joke.  Do you have a cricket sound?  Did the show move on?  Well, there's this other joke. 
[02:23:30]  Do you want to hear it?  What did I put myself into?  Oh, you know, another Jewish joke is that, uh, you go to the, um, movies on, on Christmas  Eve, and, uh, you know, somebody's got to work it, and, you know, that they're, uh, cursing 
[02:24:00]  you behind your back.  They've got to stay open for the, uh, for the ids.  What are you doing, old Christmas?  Hello?  Hello?  Here is an action. 
[02:24:30]  Three seconds.  The OP R3 Show.  The OP R3 Show.  The OP R3 Show.  Every time Travis comes in.  Oh, God.  Uh, Donald Trump on the TV, Jimmy.  I know you love him.  I like him more after I interview, yeah.  Donald.  Uh, he's not going to be doing the debate after all?  No.  He's, uh, he's called it off.  I guess because only two of the candidates were willing to even do it. 
[02:25:00]  Which two?  Newt and who?  Newt and that other guy.  Oh, the other guy said, I have nothing to lose, so what the hell?  Sapporo.  All right, we got the Penthouse Pet of the Year ready to come in here.  Uh, yeah.  Looking at the pictorial right now.  It's very sexy.  In person, she's ridiculously hot.  What's the matter?  What are you implying?  What?  In person.  I don't know.  Sometimes the girls look better in person.  Oh, holy shit.  Jenna Rose is really hot.  Sorry for my, uh, Penthouse Pet of the Year.  Sorry for my, uh, outburst like that.  I don't normally outburst in a holy shit, but wow. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, you're, uh, what's your stats there?  34, 24, 35?  That's it.  How'd you know?  I'm 20 years old.  I'm gonna...  20.  How tall are you?  Oh, I'm short.  I'm like 5'2", but...  5'2", is right?  You're petite, but you are well-proportioned, my dear.  Thank you.  Let me tell you that.  You got nice boobies.  I'm gonna go through the pictures now.  You got nice boobies.  All right.  Nice nipples.  Very nice.  All right.  And the boobs aren't, uh...  Now he's curious.  What do you say to you on?  I rifled through the zone. 
[02:26:00]  We're looking at boobs probably, uh, probably a B, full B, I'm thinking.  You want to say C, but they're full B, right?  My bra is, uh...  I wear the 34 C in bra size, so...  Okay, let's give you a C.  Small C.  Oh, the pussy nice and shaved.  Oh, Jesus.  She has very lovely private parts.  With not too much meat popping out.  Oh, Opie.  Oh, God.  I'm playing the whole...  I'm playing the whole part right now.  Oh, Opie, now.  I'll describe your vagina for everybody.  It's very...  It's plump. 
[02:26:30]  It's nice.  It's shaved.  But nice and plump.  Yeah.  Very sexy.  Yeah.  Plump is good.  Thank you.  And the anus looks like you've had a few, but not too many.  Oh, fuck.  What?  Just an observation.  What page are you on?  Wow.  Just an observation.  Yeah, maybe you skipped past to us.  Just an observation.  A few, but not too many.  That's important, I'm thinking.  Right?  Is it accurate or is it totally inaccurate?  It's totally inaccurate.  Yeah, so you don't be...  I've experimented maybe once or twice.  I said a few.  Not fully.  A few could be two or three. 
[02:27:00]  Not fully in, just maybe the tip.  I've never...  I've not fully done it yet.  Thank you.  See?  How long have you taken the tip?  By the way, we like you, so don't get confused.  It hurts.  I'm still trying to get the hang of it.  She's uncomfortable.  Plenty for the love of God.  You know?  Yeah.  She's got plenty of time for that.  You know how many guys just came because you said it hurts?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  They just lost in their cars.  They just lost it.  Did you tell them to stop?  Cumsies in their business suits.  No.  It won't hurt.  It won't hurt in your 40s.  It rattles around in there like...  Exactly. 
[02:27:30]  Like a lug wrench.  Oh, my God.  Like a...  In a trunk.  You'll be shopping online while it's happening.  So, wait.  That's horrible.  You tried with a boyfriend?  Like a little pot of soup?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like your stirred soup.  Yes, I tried it with a boyfriend.  Wait.  You got a boyfriend?  No.  Oh.  I asked her if I tried it with.  I asked her if she tried it with.  It was her boyfriend.  Why don't you have a boyfriend?  What's wrong?  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Got issues.  Issues?  What's the issues?  Girlfriend?  Daddy?  No.  You seem very nice.  Daddy.  Mommy.  I don't know.  I am just living the single life right now.  Really? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  I'm having fun.  What problem did guys have with you when you did have a boyfriend?  Well, who said there wasn't any?  Exactly.  I was setting you up for the fall on that one.  I got to tell you.  Not many girls can pull off this shot.  You do it beautifully.  Oh, God.  Is that a good one?  Where you're totally naked and you see the anus and the pussy from behind and you're looking  over your shoulder.  Well, you sure sexy it up the way you talk.  Yeah.  You see the anus and vulva.  Yeah.  Why don't you be really hot where the shit and babies come out?  The shit and babies come out. 
[02:28:30]  You do look very...  That's not an easy pose, right?  Lainey.  That's not an easy pose for the broads, right?  Hi, Lainey.  How you doing?  Good.  Isn't she great?  And you scrunched in the car because it's a car so you have the roof above you so you're  very sexy.  Yeah.  You do a very, very beautiful vagina.  We've never discussed a girl's layout in the magazine to this extent, I don't think.  Very good.  Bravo.  Thank you.  I feel special.  Clothes off to you.  Clothes off to you.  Literally.  I think they made the right choice even though we don't know who else was in the running, 
[02:29:00]  Lainey.  They weren't as good.  They were all pigs.  They weren't as good.  No.  No, they weren't as good.  Where are you from?  They are our sweethearts.  I'm from Victorville, California.  Ah, Victorville.  I was there in the desert.  Yes.  I've been to Victorville.  In the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  I've been to Victorville, Barstow.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's your second holiday.  We should go out.  Born and raised.  Talk about the desert.  Yeah.  We have a lot to talk about.  The old woman mountains out there.  Hey, you ever see some of those old ghosty towns like Baghdad in the desert? 
[02:29:30]  It was a place called Baghdad and oh, it was just so much fun shooting out there and  drinking like the Manson family.  That's actually where the Manson...  Oh, yeah.  I drove by their house.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  The layout in the desert is actually in Lancaster.  It is.  Yeah.  See?  I knew I liked something else besides your picture also, but I love the desert.  I like going out there.  It's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like you're on the moon.  Mars? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, something like that.  What kind of food do you like to eat on a date?  On a date?  Yeah.  If you're out with a gentleman caller.  If a gentleman caller picks you up and you're...  He comes courting.  If you're in a restaurant and he's got on a coat with tails and an Aussie shirt.  What's going on here?  If Jimmy's wearing tails, it just means he's got to go to the bathroom and he's waited  too long.  Yes, my entrails are falling out.  It means I've been stabbed by an American psycho and I'm chasing my stomach.  I'm going to say she likes some steak and potatoes every once in a while. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, I eat anything.  I know this shit, man.  I'm not a picky person.  Do you like sushi?  Yes.  I love sushi, Chinese, Mexican, anything.  Okay.  I love food.  That's interesting.  Well, no.  What?  We all just took a...  No, they're not all going to be winners.  We all just took a break.  Why?  What do you don't like?  I was bored by that answer.  It was just a lot of food groups.  I did ask her that.  She was asked.  He asked me and I answered that I'm not a picky person.  Sorry, do you want me to be picky?  I only eat salads. 
[02:31:00]  That's it.  You like sushi, you said?  Yes.  What's your favorite sushi?  I like the Las Vegas roll.  Wow.  At least you burst it into an entertaining segment.  Now this is ready for E.T.  I'm not going to give you a list.  You took lemons and made lemon rinds.  What's a Las Vegas roll?  It's when they have...  Oh, I wish I could improv right now, but I can't think of Vegas things.  Yes.  How about we...  What's that?  Chips.  Can we see your tattoo live instead of in the pictorial?  Sure.  What's in a Las Vegas roll? 
[02:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Those are great panties you got on.  Yeah, we did.  You're wearing rose.  It's a rose on the front.  Wow.  That's good.  She's very...  Imagine if she said, I'm not wearing panties.  I have to go to the doctor.  Yes.  It's like, oh, that's a rose on the back.  I have a patterned vagina.  Lainey...  Lainey's brutal.  She's like, lose the top.  She's telling her to lose the top.  You guys want me to take the top?  Lainey's like a...  Who would say no?  A madam.  We were trying to be polite.  Yes.  Oh, I'll take it off.  I would only say no if we were in the Middle East.  Oh, my God.  Is that a bug bite?  Wow. 
[02:32:00]  Where?  No.  I can't get bit by bugs.  Right over there.  OP.  No, down.  This?  Yeah.  No.  What is it?  Don't let me get into that.  That's actually a scar.  Is that a war wound?  Yes.  What happened?  Surgery.  Oh.  It's got to be a...  Surgery scar?  Yes.  I like that.  Surgery, you don't want to say?  Hey, chicks dig scars, right?  Yeah, a little character.  That's from an ectopic pregnancy.  How'd you know?  I know.  Yeah.  You are correct.  I'm amazing. 
[02:32:30]  I just thought it was a dumb bug bite that was healing.  Now I feel like an idiot.  I'm actually studying to be a doctor.  But then he...  Point out my flaws.  But see, let me explain something.  A lot of people think I'm the biggest dick on the show, but you see what he just did?  What did I know?  He brought it all the way home, and now we have to ask about...  I'm just saying, I know what it was.  Now we have to ask about the pregnancy, the awkward...  How about we avoid the almost death experience and talk about your nipples?  Because she's wearing a brassiere.  Very nice.  And her breasts are hanging over the top of the broader nipples, or poking... 
[02:33:00]  It looks like the little cartoon character who would peek over the fence.  Oh, Kilroy.  Where's Kilroy?  Really?  Kilroy.  This is my pants right now, as a boner.  As a boner.  Who uses that word anymore?  No one.  Where do you live full time?  You just did.  I know.  Where do you hang your hat?  I'm trying to talk real sexy.  Where do you hang your hat?  Do you live in California?  I do.  I was there last night.  I called the left coast.  Sorry to flirt.  You're doing a good job, Jimmy. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Great job.  What do you enjoy doing when you're not nude?  Not you, Jimmy.  When I'm not nude?  Yeah, I enjoy coming to radio shows.  What's your hobby again?  When I'm not working?  Yeah, when you're not working.  What do you like?  I like riding dirt bikes.  That's cool.  Okay, and you know what?  Out there in Victorville, you've got a lot of room to ride some bikes.  Dune buggies?  Get all dusty.  No, dirt bikes.  Dirt bikes.  And you used to do dune buggies.  Well, I did a little bit of both.  You know how it is.  You did a little dirt bike.  Dirt bikes, how come you don't watch it or something? 
[02:34:00]  All right, Chip, you're not funny.  See, I knew the real feeling would come out today.  Yeah, and movies?  What kind of movies do you like?  I'm trying to get a little tasty personality.  Porn movies, of course.  Porn, of course.  But that goes without saying.  I like anything with Mark Wahlberg.  Oh, you're a big Mark Wahlberg fan.  We had him in here.  We're good friends here.  Yeah.  No.  He sat right where he was sitting, if you want to smell the seat.  Can I just take it home with me?  Sure, you can.  Oh, man.  What kind of porn do you like?  See, it says, wait, right here it says, I've had a Mark Wahlberg fantasy for years to get 
[02:34:30]  him alone for a weekend.  Oh, the things I could do with him.  Oh, boy.  Me and a few items from the penthouse store.  Oh, you want to poke some shit into his hiney?  Whoa.  Fair question.  I like being dominant.  What can I say?  Do you strap on?  I do.  Do you know your strap on?  I've tried it, but it was too painful.  I couldn't do it.  He did.  No.  He felt like he was going to make duties when it went in just a little bit.  It was going good for a second.  And I had to stop.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  He needs a strap on.  He's impotent with anybody over five.  He's a pederast.  Yeah.  Who doesn't love Jimmy?  Yes, if he could pronounce a V and a W independently, he doesn't like it.  He thinks it's cute when we mix up words.  What would you want to do with Mark Wahlberg?  Yeah.  More specifics here.  I would...  Specifically?  Well, I mean, we can't just...  Like, what exactly would I like to do? 
[02:35:30]  Well, the things I would do with him.  All right.  What would those things be?  Come on.  We're trying to sell magazines here, right, Lainey?  Lainey needs some sales today.  The internet is catching up.  I would like to have my way with him and just take advantage of him.  Would you be dominant or submissive?  At first, I would be dominant.  And then maybe after I got what I wanted, then I would be submissive and let him have  his way with me.  What would you want?  From what I like to do? 
[02:36:00]  When you were dominant, what would you want from him?  What would you do to him if he said, all right, I'm in?  I would like to handcuff him down, put a blindfold over his eyes so he can't see and just slowly  just kiss him and work my way down and...  She's too nice.  Get a handsome gentleman and cover half his face with a mask.  That's good.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they usually want to do to me.  Blindfold his mouth. 
[02:36:30]  Blindfold his mouth.  His mouth knows his eyes.  Jim, we just want to cover your head with this pillow and then leave.  He can have his mouth open.  Oh, okay.  That helps.  Would you kiss him while he was submissive like that?  Oh, yeah.  Would you straddle his face and put your...  I would like to be very sensual, not just like straight up and like, fuck them.  You'd like to kiss him in a sensual manner while he's handcuffed in what could be misconstrued  as police brutality.  I'd like to just tell him I love him as I taser his genitals in a racially charged incident. 
[02:37:00]  You know, right?  At least we're on the same page here.  It's hot that she's dominant.  She's got a very nice smile.  I don't know why we're not tweeting pictures, but they're dying for pictures today, Jimmy.  I will tweet a very beautiful picture.  Are we allowed to show nipples on Twitter?  I don't know.  We don't want our accounts yanked.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know what?  Take the bra off.  Let's do a hand bra picture.  I think that'll work.  Hand bra?  They call it hand bra pictures.  Wow.  Those are very attractive breasts.  They don't move. 
[02:37:30]  You don't need a bra.  They're beautiful.  She's very lovely.  Lainey's like, they're beautiful.  Lainey, you like that, huh?  Guys never grow up when it comes to tits.  You just all of a sudden go, wow.  Ooh.  You make that like you got a new Tonka toy.  It's just, ooh.  Oh, yay.  Yay.  What can I do?  I guess E-Rock needs to be in here now, huh?  I guess you need to be in here.  Oh, E-Rock.  Do you need to read?  Here, take your hat off.  Yeah, E-Rock.  To get some more light in here.  Okay, look.  To get some more light in here.  We really want your opinion of this. 
[02:38:00]  I saw his hair.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Okay, what'd you think of it?  We were talking about it earlier.  What'd you think of it?  Well.  Okay, that's sad.  I don't know you, so nothing against you.  But I look like a douchebag.  Here, let's get some pictures done.  It looked a little queer.  Uh, a lesbian.  E-Rock looked like a lesbian.  At least that wasn't coming from a real hot girl, E-Rock.  Oh, Jimmy.  You gotta cover up the boobs and stand up.  Oh, wow. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, man, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Oh, yeah, this is gonna work.  Oh, man.  I took a picture, too.  I sent it out.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  She smells really good, Joe.  That's me.  No, it's not you.  You reek.  You smell like man.  Like, every day.  This whole place smells like a fucking locker room.  Beautiful.  Oh.  Really?  Headphones?  Really?  Yeah, why the headphones?  She's listening.  Oh, okay.  I tweeted a photo of her already.  Yeah?  It's hot.  It's really hot.  But my pickles are showing, right? 
[02:39:00]  Mine's off center.  Oh, my gosh.  Sorry.  Did you really do that?  I did, yeah.  What is it?  It's like half my face.  It's the TVs.  Thanks.  She's beautiful, man.  You really are.  You do have an amazing smile and great personality.  I just feel bad I brought up the dumb little scar thing.  Thank you.  I'm just kidding.  I got a lot of scars.  It's character building.  It's a story behind every scar.  We're talking to Jenna Rose, Pet of the Year for Penthouse, and can we try the neck thing? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, no.  What's the neck thing?  Jimmy would be willing to try the neck thing.  What's the neck thing?  Is that an Al-Qaeda thing?  We saw through after saying religious things?  I'm very sensitive on my neck.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, you want to try the neck thing?  I like my neck skin to be pulled out like a bat.  Doesn't that happen naturally when you scoop up a fish?  No, um...  Your neck is sensitive? 
[02:40:00]  Yes.  Oh, I'd add a touch in there.  I would never hurt your neck.  No.  You don't like to be choked, do you?  I do actually like being choked.  It's so fucked up.  That is just amazingly fucked up.  That is...  Okay.  If I'm doing a scene, I don't like being choked because I don't like to look like I'm being  disrespected.  But in my personal life, I like to be manhandled.  Like, you think it's sexy if a guy, if you're making love and he puts his hands on your neck  and he just like...  Yes!  And he says...  Yes.  And he says like, you know, you're gonna fucking... 
[02:40:30]  You're never gonna make it out of here.  I don't know about all of that, but...  Well, how about if he's choking you for really weird reasons?  Why did they cancel Laverne and Shirley?  I would probably get up and walk away.  Yeah, you should.  Well, you should.  Hey, do you like your neck touched?  Yes.  You ever do the choking thing yet?  That's one thing I've never fucking done.  I have.  I should always ask first, though.  Just the chicken.  No, I...  I think these are very sweet.  No, the choking thing...  I've done it a couple of times, but it just seemed weird. 
[02:41:00]  And I couldn't really commit to the full stop breathing and buried in a shallow grave.  Distribute the pressure evenly.  You can't just grab the windpipe.  Yes, yeah.  You're pushing down on the entire neck.  Right, Mr. Dahmer.  So they feel...  It's not choking, like...  Right.  Oh, my God, I can't...  It's just pressure, like...  Right, a little pressure.  I just grabbed that fucking windpipe.  And you feel, what, a little pressure in the top of your head and stuff, like a little bit?  Like, I get dizzy. 
[02:41:30]  Like, a little dizzy?  I'm about to pass out.  Oh, passing out would be great.  I've never passed out.  Then the fun really starts.  For him.  Oh, well, yeah.  I touch a neck very sexy.  Yeah, why don't we try the neck thing?  Just touching.  Is it touching, or are we going to go...  How did you just brush your neck?  What do you...  How does this work?  Well, it's got to be...  Are you going to, like, start kissing on my neck, too?  Oh, no.  I wouldn't be asking.  I wouldn't do that.  That's what, like, gets me on, like...  All right.  Let's pull the hair back.  We're going to sell some magazines, Landy.  You watch what happens now. 
[02:42:00]  And have a movie headphones, too, because I don't want to...  Do you want me to take them off, or...?  You can, yeah.  How is this for the...  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's holding his hand old creepily next to her neck.  Jimmy's really good at this stuff.  Uh-oh.  You're going to be impressed.  I'm telling you.  What the fuck are you doing?  He's like a...  It's as if a paraplegic picked...  Someone picked his hand up and just smashed it into the side of his neck. 
[02:42:30]  He is doing this so unsexy.  I'll do the section.  I'm sorry.  I'll do the section.  Come here.  Come here.  Now I'm just, like...  Okay, now I just...  It's like a dead hand.  It's all cold and clammy.  He's giving a dead hand on the side of the neck.  It's horrible.  What an ass you are.  How about I just...  All right.  No, no.  I'll do it next.  It's good.  Now he's rubbing real fast like he's trying to start a fire on her neck.  Wow.  Yeah.  I think I just got wet.  You're the best. 
[02:43:00]  God, that's funny.  You're not going to kiss her neck?  No, she's wanting to kiss her neck.  She was...  Are you wanting to kiss her neck?  I'll do it.  I don't want him kissing my neck.  You saw how he plays with my neck.  No, you blew your opportunity.  She was ready to go.  He's like me spitting all over it.  No, no.  How about we get intern Madden here?  He'll kiss her neck.  No, stop it.  All right.  They're not all winners.  God, he was the worst the other day.  They're not all winners.  On the after show.  Hey, I'm bragging about his non-threesome.  Do you like your neck kiss very gently?  Like, I like to give little kisses like this. 
[02:43:30]  Like...  What?  That looks all...  It's like a beak.  I like to pull my lips in and kiss very dryly on the neck.  I love that.  That's so hot.  We're getting some intel that's very important.  Oh, no.  What is it?  Have you done porn a little bit?  A little bit?  I just started in March.  Nice.  Congrats.  Congrats, fans.  To the biz.  And I don't know if this is true, but was mom involved?  What?  In porn?  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  That's a scene that I did, but my mom's not involved in any way, shape, or form.  What do you mean, mom?  A scene with another porn star.  Making believe it's your mom.  Yeah, exactly.  Was it stepmom or mom?  There you go.  So they almost had it.  Stepmom or mom?  She was pretending to be.  She was pretending to be my mom.  That's hot.  Like, she's in the industry, and she's bringing me in for an interview, and we do a scene together.  What old broad did they bring in for that role?  Probably about five years older than her.  That's where they ruined it.  It was Paige Bentley for that. 
[02:44:30]  Who was that?  Jimmy would know, right?  Paige Bentley?  I don't know.  You don't know Paige Bentley?  I'm old school, man.  Can we take a look at Paige Bentley?  It's like dicks.  And do you like the daddy thing?  Because Jimmy brought it up earlier.  The stepdad one?  No.  Jimmy likes...  Some girls like to fantasize where they're calling you daddy.  Not at all, and it's not a requirement for me, but I do like it when it happens,  if it's organic to that girl.  But it doesn't have to be that.  Like, do I like to call a guy daddy?  Is that what you're saying?  I don't like to call a guy daddy.  I like older men. 
[02:45:00]  Weird.  Oh, nice.  That works.  Dance back in.  That works.  Oh, yeah.  Compound's a wonderful place.  Movie theater pool.  You like shooting guns?  I've actually just went shooting for my first time not too long ago.  Oh, isn't it fun?  Yeah.  Just target shooting.  Been there, done that though.  Really?  Really, Jimmy?  She's been there, done that.  But you enjoyed it.  I did.  Yeah, see?  It'll be fun.  I'm up for new things though.  I love trying new things.  Oh, believe me.  There's plenty.  Is that your mom?  Plenty of new things.  Is that my mom?  I mean, the fifth mom? 
[02:45:30]  That's not my mom.  The fifth mom, I mean.  That's Natalie Paige Bentley.  Oh, Jesus, Sam.  There's more than one Paige Bentley?  Sam.  Exactly.  Which one?  That's her.  Is that you?  Oh, in the background.  But look at...  Oh, who's in the foreground?  Who's in the foreground?  Is that you blowing someone?  Wow.  Oh, wow, let me see.  That's good.  Wow.  Who's that one?  Lucky devil.  That is a good one.  Look at mom disapproving, scolding.  She's mad because you're not doing it right. 
[02:46:00]  You've not had your dessert.  She's going to go, give me that dick.  That's how the scene was.  It was where I was learning.  She was teaching me how to do it.  Look, she's got the pink little hair thing in her hair.  And you had to make believe you never did that before for the scene.  Oh, what's this?  A cock?  I like when they're all like, oh, I don't know what...  And they just swallow the whole thing.  Oh, this is so...  Is that what a penis looks like?  I know...  Like, holy shit.  She's amazing.  Can you get an acting lesson? 
[02:46:30]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  How'd you get into the biz?  Like, where are you from?  I know you're from California.  They found me on MySpace.  MySpace?  MySpace.  Yeah, I was checking my...  When you were 13?  Holy shit.  Who had MySpace?  Yeah, how'd you know?  They found me on MySpace.  Yeah, when I broke up with my ex, I...  Oh, that must have put him over the edge.  Oh, boy.  You must have been really bad, too.  You're not going to do shit without me!  You're going to guess I...  No, but I checked my old MySpace account to see what all my, like, old friends were up 
[02:47:00]  to, and I had a message from an agent saying, would I be interested in nude modeling?  Wow.  So I went over there for an interview, and...  How'd you know he wasn't a creep, though?  Well, he was a creep.  He has to be...  Well, I mean...  She.  You know, murder.  She.  Oh, okay, that probably...  Oh, because there are a lot of creeps that probably do that every fucking day. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  So how do you know?  Oh, there is.  There's a lot of scams.  It was...  We were going back and forth in messages for a while, and then we talked over the phone,  and I kind of just went for it.  I was like...  Yeah, look at you.  So what'd you do when you get over there?  You said hello, and...  Here's my tits.  Yeah, how'd you happen?  She didn't, like, ask to look at me naked or anything.  She just basically went over everything and told me what I would be doing and how much  I could make, and I was working in and out, and my paycheck was... 
[02:48:00]  And my paychecks were already spent before I even got it.  It's like, that's what you're doing now in that movie.  Really?  You never left it anymore.  Holy shit.  I just got a promotion.  What?  All right, she's throwing things at me.  I think I'm done here.  Do you know what I would have said when she came over?  I would have said, well, it's nice to meet you.  Let's see the goodies.  Oh, my gosh.  Jimmy is really putting up this real sexy persona today.  Wow.  I'm going to give you my number when we leave.  Oh, damn.  Let's see the goodies. 
[02:48:30]  Jimmy does very well with the ladies.  Yeah.  You'd be very surprised.  Yeah.  They like me.  As soon as I touch them.  They don't do well with him.  Call me daddy.  Yeah.  Call me daddy.  It's pop pop.  I like pop pop.  Yeah.  Let me touch your neck like a dead man.  They love dead hand.  Dead hand on the neck is a fucking panty dampener, my friend.  That's a big fetish.  Yeah, it's got to be.  Cadaver hand.  They love that.  Like, what I'll do is I'll just leave it like that and you can do whatever you want with it.  Oh, yeah.  And just lays in front of her.  Like a toy.  I've had it with the vague answers.  Oh. 
[02:49:00]  It says here, I've made love in many exciting places and that list continues to grow.  Yeah.  Nassau County.  A recent high point was in Virginia on a tractor out in an open field.  I'll never look at a tractor the same way again.  Where's the, I want to see the list of places.  Well, the reason why I didn't have a list was because in my previous magazine, I was already  talking.  You get crabs from a tractor seat, by the way.  Be very careful.  Good thing I wasn't sitting on a seat.  You get what?  Crabs from the tractor seat.  Really?  Yeah.  Can you?  I heard it on Sunfield.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:49:30]  Do you have like a story you want to share?  I just heard it from somebody.  What was the previous magazine?  Conneria.  That's right.  Conneria.  The first issue of Penthouse.  The first one, my pet of the month.  I know.  You were pet of the month in 2011, I believe.  What?  I know this stuff.  I researched.  Yeah, but anyways, it talked about like these places, so I didn't want to do the list again  because it's already in that issue.  What was the list, though, for us?  Because we don't know.  Colorado River, on a dirt bike, on the Interstate I-40, you know, on a Sea-Doo. 
[02:50:00]  Wow, that's pretty fucking rough.  What's a Sea-Doo?  It's a personal watercraft.  Wow.  Was that a serious question?  I don't know what a Sea-Doo is.  Jimmy doesn't get out much.  A Sea-Doo.  Jimmy works a lot.  I dropped one of those off the side of the boat once.  On the top of a trailer?  Oh.  All right.  Yeah, that would be a little like 40-foot trailer.  Like a double-wide type, but a single-wide. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, that's a good question.  Then it's a single-wide.  Yeah.  I don't know what a Sea-Doo is.  Scott in Texas writes, I choked my girl once.  Went from sexy to her crying scared.  Aw.  You didn't have one of those words?  And it scared him to death.  Safe word?  Yeah.  And then he never did it ever again.  Yeah, man.  I don't know.  They should maybe teach a course on choking or something.  Well, it depends on the girls.  Well, not every girl likes to be choked.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Some feel that's being disrespected.  Do you like to be spanked? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's the fucking spanking king.  That is something he will do right the fuck now.  He's not going to trust anything you say now.  No, what I do is I take the one hand, and I snap it back, and I just allow it to go  like that.  And then it stays.  Yes, and I paddle a fanny.  Jimmy, can you show your technique today?  You've done it in the past.  I haven't spanked in many years.  You want to spank me?  Oh.  Okay, it'll be very sexy.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  A little spanking.  Hey.  All right. 
[02:51:30]  Okay.  Oh.  Nice spank.  What are you doing?  What is he doing?  He did this bad wind-up, and then he missed.  It was like a bad high five.  No, it wasn't.  I was just warming up.  Okay.  Can I do it now?  I missed on a perfectly good spanking.  Can I do it now?  Yeah, he'll do it right.  He'll do it right.  I ain't got a hard chip.  He's making big bug eyes.  He's like, chip.  He's warming his hand like Mr. Miyagi.  Oh, gosh.  Practice it on my own hand.  Don't do it like that. 
[02:52:00]  I just rubbed.  Yeah.  You are terrible.  It's good, right?  Oh, my God.  That was awesome.  Remember the old days, Jimmy would really work it, and you don't feel like doing it.  Oh, that's the only thing I'm going to do.  I'm sticking my carrots just to a little.  I would do it.  Yeah, but it's like, why?  Yeah.  You know what?  Why?  Because maybe you would like a...  She really wants it, Jimmy.  I'll do one, but I won't do it hard.  Okay, I'll do one.  Can you bend over a little bit for our pleasure? 
[02:52:30]  You have to face it this way.  Come this way.  That butt.  Okay.  You rub the bottom a little bit like this.  You just rub it nicely.  Yeah.  Get the mic near your mouth, because she'll moan.  Oh, really?  She'll moan?  Oh, no.  She needs to be mic'd.  What do you think?  I'm actually mic'd her ass.  I really am.  My ass is going to talk.  There's two asses, Mike, right there.  Look at this.  We got three microphones on this situation.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  Oh.  No?  I'm not doing that hard. 
[02:53:00]  She's smiling on...  Is that good?  I can't read her.  Is that good or not?  I'm not asking you, Jimmy.  Of course, it's good for you.  I like it.  You like it?  It's not too rough, but it's...  No.  I'm doing life.  What are you trying to do?  Okay.  You rub?  I felt a finger trying to...  I felt a finger trying to get in there.  No, no.  What you do is this.  I wouldn't finger you, Heidi.  I haven't trimmed my nails.  No, you rub, you rub, you speckle out. 
[02:53:30]  I like that.  That was good.  You don't do it too hard.  You don't just start off bad or something.  You just do your rub and you do nice.  That was nice.  Thank you.  Lainey, we ask all the questions.  What are we missing?  I don't want her to leave here and we could have asked her something cool.  Ask her whatever you want.  Ask her whatever you want.  Well, we've been doing a good job with that.  When did you start your sexual career?  In March.  No.  My very first time I had sex was when I was 15.  Wow.  That's the greatest time.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  It was amazing.  How old was the guy?  Being pressured into it and all.  Were you pressured into it?  Yeah, I was.  It was what?  I remember you.  I was dating the guy.  But he thought that maybe, oh, well, I'll let you pick the color condom.  Oh, God.  So he kind of like bribed me into it.  How long were you going out before you had sex with him?  For like a year.  All right.  Yeah, that's a year.  For 15-year-olds, you've got to spend a lot of time.  Really?  Yeah.  An easy amount of time.  You find that these days?  Well, no, not these days.  None of you.  Not these days.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:54:30]  Depending on the state.  Oh, it's crazy.  And then you can't just ditch him because then they feel fucking, you know, then you  ruin their whole life.  I was going to spend the rest of my life with you.  I loved you and you.  Yeah.  Anthony, that's pretty good, though.  To put this in perspective, when we came back to radio, she was 13.  Perfect.  That's awesome.  That's weird.  Yeah.  So you were 15 and it, I guess, didn't go well.  Didn't feel good.  No, it was actually really awkward because I didn't know what I was doing and he didn't 
[02:55:00]  know what he was doing.  Oh, how old is he?  I'm sorry.  He was a junior when I was a freshman.  Oh, okay.  So just two high school kids laughing around fucking each other.  But the thing was, he wasn't a virgin when I lost my virginity.  So I thought maybe he had the experience, but it didn't work out that way.  So when was the first time it actually, you were like, oh, okay, this is the way it's  supposed to be.  How old?  Oh, wow.  15 and a half. 
[02:55:30]  Thanks.  No, I was actually just last year.  Wow.  Yeah.  Damn.  When's the first time you were like, just coming and stuff like nobody's business?  I can only come orally.  Oh.  Yeah.  How about that?  I like to get in there and just start licking away like it's crazy.  Show them the tongue technique, Chip.  I just keep my tongue straight. 
[02:56:00]  It does.  It's like a bird tongue.  Isn't it like a bird's tongue?  It's like you're going to get it stuck on a frozen hole.  And I move my head left and right real fast like this.  I just keep stopping.  I'm like, you're going to come soon or what?  Oh, yeah.  That would hit my G-spot.  How could it not?  Should we have E-Rock smack her?  Gold school?  No.  No, because E-Rock.  We might have had a problem.  Why?  Yeah.  Justine Jolie.  I like Justine.  We do like her, but E-Rock decided to fucking wallop her. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, did he smack her ass?  Did she get bruised?  You want to hear it?  She had a big fucking, like, welt on her ass.  She was penthouse back then, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You got that, E-Rock?  You still?  I'm looking for it.  Hang on.  Oh, yeah.  And also, uh, J-  Take your hat off and brighten the room up.  JD's linking us to a picture of Jenna getting her asshole licked by another girl.  Oh.  Oh, I don't go for that.  Do you like the, uh, the little ass play with the licking the ass?  And I'm not, like, opposed to it. 
[02:57:00]  I'm not comfortable doing it on film yet, but I like doing it.  Wow.  I love doing it, especially to a guy.  Oh, good.  Well, she's a good egg.  You're a crazy girl.  I love it.  That's great.  She's a very good girl.  I like doing a girl's entire undercarriage like I'm doing a rust-proofing.  Winterizing it?  Yeah, putting that true coat on, you know?  Yeah, you gotta love that true coat.  I like to go from the front to the back.  I'll just go like this.  Smells good, stinks. 
[02:57:30]  Smells good, stinks.  Good, not so good, Ben.  You like it all clean back there, though, right?  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  Well, no, like, are you talking about, like, with hair and stuff?  Well, the smell and all that shit.  Okay, well, yeah, if you just took a shit, I don't want it.  You know what comes out of a guy's ass?  You don't want it.  I'm not going to lick your ass.  Like, come on.  I think a nice pre-sex shower would be nice if you're going to be doing that shit.  Like, right before clean-up, right before. 
[02:58:00]  Hold on, but let's do this the right way.  Okay, obviously shower, but how far without the shower?  Two hours after the shower, you're still licking ass?  If you're not doing any physical activity where you're not, like, sweating it.  Yeah, exactly.  It could be all day.  Rounding up cattle in the hot Texas sun.  How about if he's mewling drugs in it?  If he wants you to lick his ass after he pulls a bag of Oxycontin out.  And I'm talking to the wrong guy.  No, she's earthly. 
[02:58:30]  She doesn't care.  I like that.  He just got done with the Daytona 500.  Wow, that's got to be a smelly ass.  How about if you walk over and the first thing he says is, I have the flu?  That gets her really hot.  You want to hear Justin Jolie getting spanked?  Yeah.  This is brutal, and, you know, this is not us, General.  E-Rock's sexual prowess right here.  You can see E-Rock with the blonde hair.  Something's going on with him, and he fucking walloped Justin Jolie.  Oh, gosh.  Listen to this.  Ah!  Oh!  Ow!  Oh!  Mother fucker! 
[02:59:00]  Mother fuck you!  E-Rock!  Fuck you!  Fuck sucker!  That sounded like a punch.  Like a movie punch.  Like, yeah!  She had a bruised handprint on her ass.  Oh, I can't do that.  I've got to do two live chats tomorrow.  Oh, we understand you can't.  Oh, man.  So what do you do, live chats?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm with a guy's like, jack off.  Fucking jack off while they're watching you.  Yeah, they pound their puds, right?  I get my puds so juicy.  It's like a grain silo. 
[02:59:30]  Start shooting cum like a grain silo.  Got shot or something.  Holy shit!  I shoot so much cum one time.  Yeah, yeah, Chip, what happened?  Yeah, get all your shoes and stuff.  Yeah.  He's the worst.  What else can we do?  Oh, god damn.  Let's do stuff.  Let's do stuff.  What?  Let's play a game.  Yeah.  Hey, that reminded me.  Do you drink?  Do I drink?  Yeah.  I do.  A lot?  No, not a lot.  I'm a social drinker. 
[03:00:00]  I don't go home and be like, damn, that was a long day.  I'm going to...  Pills?  Yeah.  No.  What do you like?  What do you like?  What do I what?  She doesn't do pills.  I don't do pills.  No pills?  What do you like to drink?  Marijuana?  No.  I've tried marijuana.  Oh.  My ex, the one that got me into losing my virginity.  The one that made you suck cock on film.  Not him.  The first one actually got me to try weed for my first time, too.  What do you like to drink?  I get paranoid now.  If I smoke weed, I'll freak out.  It's not good. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Don't want that.  What do you like to drink?  I like to drink hard, like Jack and 7-Up.  Okay.  That's telling.  That's telling?  Yeah, it's good.  Lainey would like your choice.  I don't want to give a whole list because then he's going to say that was a lame answer.  No, I'm not.  No, you're not.  Opie.  I'm not.  Opie.  Overcritical Opie.  I'm playing a lady.  I'm trying to sell magazines.  I know what she wants today.  And she rolled her eyes with your drink choice if you really want to know the truth. 
[03:01:00]  Jack and Coke, honey.  Jack and Ginger is good.  Yeah, Jack and 7-Up is good.  How about this?  Do you like Captain Morgan?  What does Laney drink?  Yes.  A little sweet, but I like it.  Dirty martini.  Dirty martini is in between all the pills, right?  I have a bar at my house.  Full bar.  It's crazy.  Really?  And a movie theater right across from that.  It's just a fun place to be.  That's all I'm saying.  How about this?  Oh, Jesus.  We go out.  We have some Melba Toast.  Maybe some Sanka.  Sanka and Melba Toast.  Oh, God.  That could be the two worst things. 
[03:01:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a great time.  What time are you on?  Yeah, maybe some peak-free cookies.  Melba Toast and Sanka.  Not even a nice real cup of coffee.  What's your ethnic background?  Irish.  Not you.  Let's guess.  I'm a mutt.  Yeah, guess.  Well, you just said it.  I'm going to guess.  But what?  What is it?  I'd say there's got to be a little bit of guinea in you.  Scottish? 
[03:02:00]  A little Italian in you?  Scottish and Somalian.  Uh-uh.  You want some?  Indian.  Yes.  That's the old guinea.  Wait, what'd you say?  Injun.  Injun?  American Indian.  A little bit.  No.  My mom.  Come on, give it to me.  I know this shit.  My mom was black, but my dad's Cherokee.  There you go.  I know this shit.  You know how you think that's obvious?  Because Indian girls always have, I mean this, fat vaginas are, is it quality?  I'm telling you.  Not fat in that way.  Juicy.  Juicy.  Juicy.  I mean it in a very positive way.  Yeah, pull the vagina out.  We'll point and show you what he means. 
[03:02:30]  I mean that in a very nice way.  It's so nice to have somebody here.  I know that sounds creepy, but I'm saying that in a complimentary way.  It's a sexy quality.  Yeah.  I heard that on Nat Geo.  And French, Irish, German, and all that.  I see the engine, though.  Yeah.  Just enough that makes it sexy.  Engine?  That's nice.  You know, a little too much engine, not too good.  Blackfoot's Indian, right?  Don't get me to not like you anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  My foot is not black.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, what are you, running around tar or something?  That'll be tar toes.  All right.  I guess a black foot usually ruins a girl.  See?  It's a foot.  We should feel it. 
[03:03:00]  We should.  I think we should feel her up and send her on her way now.  What?  Thanks.  That's a good way to leave.  Let me feel your boobs.  It was nice meeting you.  Goodbye.  We could play cowboys in engines.  Yeah.  That'd be fun.  I was always a cowboy.  I like to lasso and stuff.  You know what?  And I know you hate this idea, but we gotta do it.  Yeah?  Can intern Matt feel up your boobs?  Yeah.  Because he's a ladies' man.  Oh, I can't.  Why would you give him that?  You know what?  Who else?  Who else?  Who else?  No.  I'm fucking denying him.  Someone has to feel her up. 
[03:03:30]  No.  Then you come up with somebody.  You've been pressing back here to come in since she walked into the room.  I don't fucking like him enough to let him do that.  All right.  That's a fucking, that's a fucking prize for someone that did a shit intern job.  All right.  Then fuck Matt.  Then pick someone that can feel up her boobs.  I'll do it.  All right.  I don't care.  No, I don't care.  It's not, uh, I don't care.  All right.  You have to pick someone, though.  That can, too.  You know what I mean?  Get the fuck out of here.  You greasy fucking ass.  How about we give it to Sal, who is the much better intern.  Sal is good.  Sal is good.  Sal is good. 
[03:04:00]  Sal is good.  Sal gets it.  Shut up.  You look all drugged out.  You're a fucking wreck.  You're kind of, what happened?  Wait, you know what?  He looks drugged up.  Are you sick?  You got the flu or something?  Ah, Kenny's pushing him out.  Good.  Troy.  Hit the road.  Oh, yeah.  Interns probably aren't allowed to do that.  All right.  What?  But on-air staff is.  What about Troy?  Oh, Troy works.  Look at Troy.  He's a strapping man, right?  He is.  All right.  You getting a boner, Troy?  Yes. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Tits.  Not like you're fucking, you know, feeling if the tie rods are tight on a car, you know,  be a little sensitive.  She said you probably couldn't squeeze him so hard that she passes out.  No, I did not see that.  Wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Natural.  Right?  Why don't you look her in the eyes, though?  Those are amazing natural.  Yeah.  Like, those shouldn't be natural and be like that.  But again, she's 20.  He grabbed them like they're melons.  Could Chip, I got to acknowledge Chip today, unfortunately.  But could Chip fill up your boots? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  All right, Chip.  Let's just let everybody fill my boots.  Let's see it again.  Everyone.  Just come on.  Everyone.  Here's Chip.  Oh, gosh.  He's really good at this.  I'm kind of scared.  Okay.  I'll be nice.  I can hurt him.  Oh, jeez, Chip.  Oh, no.  Chip.  He grabbed them and juggled them sideways.  That was good, right?  That was different.  He juggled them around sideways.  Yeah, I was grabbing them.  I was shaking and stuff. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Wow.  You definitely left a good impression on me.  Yeah, I know.  I'll get Chip's so wet.  Chip's one of the best.  And choking needs to be done from behind.  Could he choke you?  What?  Yeah.  What?  Is that how you do it behind you?  At the parking lot?  That's how you do it.  Oh, you do it.  You're a master at it?  I don't know if I'm a master at it, but I like to do it.  Could he choke you a little bit?  Sure.  Can I show you?  Yeah.  You can show me.  Okay, yeah.  Show me how you would.  Can you stand up?  Oh, polite.  Let's go.  To be on the safe side, let's. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, man.  She's bent over the console.  Yeah, let's start a little slow so she's cool with it.  Right.  And then we'll see where this goes.  All right.  So, yeah.  So, when you're behind.  You do this a lot, Troy?  I mean, I have.  I don't know if it's a.  You've been known to choke a bitch?  Yeah, I'll choke a bitch.  All right.  No, I'm not saying you.  I'm just saying.  No, just in general.  Bitch being a good thing, of course.  He goes out with a lot of fleas.  So, then what you do is you reach up.  Just tell me if I'm being a little too hard, okay?  So, then you start like this.  Oh.  And you start whispering things in her ear.  Like what?  Let's go.  Like you're never going to see your loved ones again? 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  Wait.  Wait.  She really liked that.  She kind of liked that.  That was good.  Just like.  Do you like when I fuck you?  I guess you like that.  Wait.  Oh.  That's too vulgar.  But are you fucking you?  I'm fucking you.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yes.  During sex, that would be awesome.  And then you can also choke and then pull hair at the same time.  Oh.  Wow.  You're multifaceted.  Your vagina's slipping out a little bit.  Oh.  Who cares?  Oh, good.  Hopi, what's wrong with you?  You're a rat?  No, you never say tuck your pussy in. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  I'm just choking.  Tuck your pussy in.  I'm just choking.  What was this?  All right.  Listen.  It's my crotchless panties.  It actually worked the way I wanted to because then she pulled the whole thing in and  readjusted everything.  You want to continue, Troy?  I mean, it's up to her.  Janet Rose, you want to continue?  We're going to sell magazines, Lainey.  How are you going to continue?  If we continue?  How far are you going to go?  He's going to fuck her?  Is that how far we're going?  I'm going to end up bashing her head off the console.  I'm going to continue.  Troy's got a lot of anger from this place.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:07:30]  Thank you.  It can get real fast.  I'm just playing.  I'm just having fun.  But yeah.  She liked that, though.  You did it properly.  That's how you did that.  That was good.  If you're having sex.  Not just like.  In the middle of a moment.  I mean, sitting in a radio studio is a little awkward.  I would never.  I would never.  You're on a subway or something.  That would be bad.  I would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would never.  And if he's just standing behind me with nothing in me.  Oh, no.  It's like.  I would never be able to do that.  Yeah, it's hot.  It's hot.  Especially when the girls are really in it.  And there's a lot of girls that really.  They like abuse.  They like what to be dominated.  You know, like slapping and.  You didn't do it right, though.  You didn't say the good stuff. 
[03:08:00]  You were saying dumb stuff.  Oh, really?  What's good stuff?  Chip, you want to try it?  Yeah.  All right, Chip.  Chip, try it?  You want to try it?  Yeah, I mean.  Give it a try, Chip.  All right.  If your cooter can handle getting as wet as it's about to get.  It's going to be like the Agra Falls or something.  Oh.  I'm ready.  All right.  I'm ready.  Go ahead, Chip.  All right.  Ben, back over.  Let's get back in position.  I'm going to make sure my underwear is fine.  Okay.  Yeah.  I hope he might get upset.  Yeah.  He might tell me something.  Yeah.  Hey, your pants are off.  Thanks, O. 
[03:08:30]  Your poop's already getting off.  Yeah, I shit it.  I want to cover those up.  FCC regulations and all.  Oh, please.  All right.  Here's Chip.  I'm getting ready to just.  Chip's got a sexy face on.  No, you're good.  You're all bent over.  Bent over.  I'll just start.  I'm going to choke you.  Like.  You're talking.  You're like when I play like a field and stuff.  You're like when I stick it like this deep and shit.  If I fuck you any harder and stuff, we'll have to move out of the whole zip code.  What does that mean, Chip? 
[03:09:00]  That's your sexy talk?  He's making up his own joke.  That's good.  No, he's good.  That's horrible.  I was saying that we'll be.  We'll be.  I'll be sticking it in.  But you have to be behind me.  You were on the side of me.  So how would you be.  Oh, okay.  I'll go behind you.  Oh, my God.  Get up there.  All right.  Oh, my God.  My neck is over here.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You ready?  Hold on.  I got to tweak this shit, too.  That shit.  And it's got it on the thing. 
[03:09:30]  You ready?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to pull your hair, too.  Hold on.  Take that shit.  Wait.  Take it.  Take it.  I'm going to come so much that we're both going to fall over.  Jimmy, do that as a pose now.  Do that as a pose.  I can't.  She's getting too into it.  For the Twitter.  For the pose.  She's getting too into it.  All right.  Here it is.  Good pick.  Oh, my God.  It's hot.  Oh, God.  Fucking ass. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, my God.  That's good, though.  Yeah, I was all right, Jimmy.  I mean, Chip.  That was the best sex I've ever had.  I don't doubt it.  I was ramming you good, though, right?  You were.  I felt a little.  Look.  I felt a little.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't look, man.  He's getting a little pop tank gone in his eye.  I have to pee too bad to get hard.  That's just my gift.  Yeah.  The little hummingbird ladder.  Oh, God.  Yeah, no.  I can't get a ride right now.  I have to pee too bad.  That was funny. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, my God.  This picture's ridiculous.  That was very funny.  It's funny.  Oh, shit.  You look like you're barely riding a horse.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a maniac.  Oh, you got to post that.  That's hilarious.  I will.  Oh, yeah.  You're not got a good one.  At least my neck looks thin.  Jesus.  I should have my fucking.  Did you stretch it up?  Oh, I'm terrible.  Hey, Jenna, do you have a Twitter? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  I do.  It's at JennaRoseXX.  All right.  Let's blow up your Twitter today.  JennaRoseXX.  Because you were awesome.  You were very funny.  Some of you broads suck.  I mean, I got to tell you.  You were really good.  You were very jaded before you came in.  No, you were really good.  Before you came in, Opie was very jaded.  He's like, oh, God.  I know one of these girls.  There's a lot of them come in, and they don't want to just have fun.  Laney knows.  You were a lot of fun.  Even Laney, so many times after the show, apologizes and stuff.  Hey, you were really cool.  Laney, what are you?  On the highway or something?  He got you, Laney. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  And JennaRoseXX, and I'm tweeting Chip having his way with JennaRose.  It's brutal.  Chip just wrecks everything.  That was fun.  Thank you.  Chip, a.k.a.  I'll have to put the next thing.  Yeah, you're very fun.  You're very fun.  Oh, my God.  That was fucking fun.  What else can we say?  Laney, anything?  Is this on newsstands yet?  It is.  Nice.  She has a perfect body, the kind of body I happen to love. 
[03:12:00]  And a very fun personality.  Less, you know.  Well, if you ever want to do a round two, then.  Yeah, you know.  If only you were transgendered.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Thank you.  Well, does Jimmy, I mean.  I'm thinking about it.  Jimmy will admit what he wants to admit to.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  We've heard things.  You like lima beans?  Why?  I'm just trying to think of interesting food that we could eat.  How about asparagus?  Yeah.  I like asparagus.  What are we going to do?  We're like, I'll lay asparagus on my body and you can eat it off. 
[03:12:30]  Well, we once had a girl.  I did that one time with cold spinach.  I told the girl, just throw it in your pussy.  I'll lick it right out.  Jesus.  She threw spinach in her pussy.  I ate it right out for like two hours.  Sexy.  Two hours?  Two hours.  It took that long to find it?  That's great.  One time I threw a bunch of creamed corn on there.  I fucking licked it right out like it was denim or something.  Well, you're wayward words there, Chip.  Yeah, licking creamed corn out of there.  We've had a lot of success with vegetables over the years in this show. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Our audience?  What we've had?  They're retarded.  We had asparagus, girl.  Our dumb audience.  You hear that, guys?  Oh, please do.  They know it.  They know.  If they could understand what I was saying, I'd be worried.  No, they know.  They know.  We had a girl work her asshole with an asparagus.  The buffalo, what was that?  Zucchini, was it?  Zucchini.  Zucchini and the puss?  Really?  Very impressive.  Wow.  I was crazy at a beach party. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  You were probably 2002 before we got fired.  Oh, no.  How old were you in 2002?  10.  10?  Yeah.  Really?  11, maybe.  For a young lady.  Might have been nine.  What year were you born?  91.  I was doing comedy when she was born.  We were doing...  We only went back to 91 with the times.  Oh, yeah.  End of the year thing.  Like it was yesterday for us. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  91?  That's impossible.  That's impossible.  That's impossible.  How is it?  No one was born in 91.  No, that's...  I keep my head around that.  How's that possible?  Wow.  Do you like reading around with the guy if they have a really sexy laugh?  Do I like to hear you?  To turn on, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She was three when me and Ant started doing radio together.  Just to make it really happy.  Are you saying you have a really sexy laugh?  Oh, yeah, he does.  I do.  Yeah?  Let's hear it. 
[03:14:30]  Tweet.  Opie Radio, if you want to see Chip having his way with Jenna Rose Triple X on Twitter.  I look like I'm wearing a fucking fat thing around my head.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah, but you're doing that thing, you know?  You're like getting all tense.  Yeah, yeah.  You're in the moment, Jim.  You were pounding away.  That's right.  You were good.  I was teaching it a lesson.  Teaching it a lesson. 
[03:15:00]  I teach pussy lessons.  We got a really good video.  We just got to figure out where to post it.  Daily Motion, I think, is good.  Look into it, lady.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Jimmy, you got anything to...  Yeah, whatever the club...  I will be in Saratoga Comedy Club, Queensbury, Friday, Saturday,  Saturday, January 14th, and the Borgata sold out with Artie Lang and Doug Stanhope and 
[03:15:30]  David Tell.  The 15th, I don't even know if there's tickets available because I haven't updated yet with  Pete.  And January 27, 28, Tempe, Arizona.  Jimmy's a big star, Jenna.  I mean, nobody.  He really is.  Who needs to tap dance to fucking plug my gigs.  And February 3, 4.  Oh, I keep getting all these things.  People want to know if I'm in Bananas and Poughkeepsie in December.  No.  February 3, 4.  I don't know what it was on sale.  Okay.  And the Penthouse Pet of the Year, Jenna Rose.  Yes.  Very cool.  Very funny.  Absolutely.  And very pretty.  You were very fun.  Thank you. 
[03:16:00]  And I guess that's it for us today.  Yeah.  That's it for us.  Lainey, this was a good one.  Stay tuned for the shit show.  After show.  With Sam Roberts.  The shit show.  You didn't do that to me.  Oh.  I'm sure you'll bring that asshole on.  I love this band.  That greasy fucking, looks like he's on meth.  Interns are probably not allowed to do that.  I would say that.  Yeah, of course.  But, geez, he came in here like.  Didn't he just look like a meth head?  Fucking.  Tits.  Wow.  I don't blame him.  The young man, he's an eager young man.  Yeah, it was weird. 
[03:16:30]  Wants to touch a pair of breasts.  A lazy bastard.  Who wouldn't run in here?  Thank you guys so much.  It was great.  You know what?  Oh, thank you.  And you know what?  What?

Who allows you to do pictures then?  What's wrong with Y-Frog?  I don't know.  There's nothing showing.  They all stink.  Which service does I Like Girls Daily use? 
[03:18:30]  I'm serious.  Quiet.  No, I'm serious.  It's a quiet radio show.  It's great.  Someone fucking help me out.  I like to ponder.  Yeah, because we got really good pictures that we want to share to people.  Imgur.com.  Yeah, I've seen them.  Are they good?  I don't know.  Someone's just saying.  You know what?  Someone says, I still see the photo, Opie.  I don't think so.  Do you see it?  No, it says photo removed.  I just got it sent to me.  The photo has been removed. 
[03:19:00]  So I say, if Y-Frog is removing photos like that, I say we all stop using Y-Frog.  The photo's still there, it says.  Imgur.  It's not there.  They've got to maybe refresh their pearls.  Yeah, refresh.  What is your Twitter name?  Uh, Generosha Blex.  Oh.  Well, well, well.  Jimmy Norton's fault.  No.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Shh.  It's our little secret.  What are we going to do?  I don't know.  No, I don't think it's there.  I see it. 
[03:19:30]  What?  It's showing up on your Twitter.  Then how the fuck did it say photo removed?  I have photo removed.  What were you looking at?  Everyone refresh right now.  Everyone refresh.  Okay.  Let's see what happens.  Alright, that's better.  That's better.  I like that.  Is it still there now?  Yeah, it's still there.  No, it's still there.  Oh, shit.  No.  I think people are talking.  Maybe it's being slammed so much.  That's the wrong photo.  You're talking about the one where it was just her. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  With the handbook.  Oh, you idiot.  He's just a dumb lesbian.  You ruin everything.  He's got bleach in his brain or something.  Ever since you started doing those Stop the Insanity commercials.  Susan Powder.  Powder?  Susan Pounder.  He's heavy.  He's heavy sex.  Yeah, that's okay.  He's a big boy.  Hold on, Opie.  I'm going to check right now on Wafrog.  Wafrog.  Oh.  Nah, I think it's...  Wafrog. 
[03:20:30]  That's stupid, man.  Nothing was showing.  It's gone.  It's gone, right?  Wafrog stinks.  So I say everyone fucking blows off Wafrog and tell them why.  Frog?  We all got to work together with this shit.  Enough already.  Alright.  And as in enough already, let's go home.  Thank you very much.  Put your clothes on, I guess.  Thanks.  Lainey, thanks once again for a wonderful experience.  Take it easy.  Penthouse Pet of the Year.  Jenna Rose, triple X on Twitter.  Not the triple part, though.  Just do XXX.  Yes.  Alright. 
[03:21:00]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Opie, you're not out of the door yet.  You're still on the show, technically.  What's that, Roland?  It's a broken clipboard?  What do we got out?  Travis got mad?  I don't know.  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:21:30]  I gotta go.  There's only one of them's autograph, though.  They're tight.  Oh.  Look what the After Show has prizes for the listeners.  What she should do is autograph her clit.  What'd you say, Eric?  How many people have, like, autographs of clits?  Eric, say it on the air.  I can't hear him.  I don't have headphones.  I know.  He's just saying it in my ear.  Because I didn't want to interrupt Opie talking.  That's why I was talking to you.  What's up, A?  No, you can't give those away on the air.  What?  Can't give those away on the air.  Why?  Can't do porn giveaways on the air. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, Christ.  My bad.  My bad.  Can't do adult material.  It's against the law.  Why don't you have a little something to jerk yourself off to?  I guess everyone should just follow me on Twitter, Opie Radio, and then we'll figure  out how to give them away.  What?  You're not going to give anything away.  You're just trying to insert a cheap...  Was that plug really awkward?  That one could be my worst one yet.  By far.  That was a bad one.  I'm going to go Sambo.  All right.  Dicks in the ass.  Dicks in the ass for Roland.  Why dicks in the ass for you today?  Oh, you left the computer on.  Did you fall asleep during the movie yesterday? 
[03:22:30]  I forgot to ask you.  Oh, Mission Impossible?  Well, the movie was so good, I didn't look at Roland to see if he was falling asleep like  he does every other movie.  Well, see, here's the thing.  You can't ask Roland now if he fell asleep during the movie after we have the guests  in and he doesn't have to deal with the publicist anymore.  No, no, because we all know it's because he's tired.  Yeah, but he still won't admit that he fell asleep.  He warned me, Sam.  I walked in, he goes, I might fall asleep.  I'm really tired.  In Mission Impossible?  Yeah, he was really tired, though.  But that means the movie's really good because there's Roland who usually falls asleep when  he's not tired and he's really tired before Mission Impossible starts and he didn't fall 
[03:23:00]  asleep.  Did you really not fall asleep?  That should be on a poster.  Roland did not fall asleep.  No, there's so much action and everything.  It was awesome.  Roland Campos says, I was awake.  I was.  I'm so proud of myself.  Sam, plug my shit.  I mean, if I get to it, we'll see.  You have a show you can plug and I have a show where I'll do what I want.  And if Matt Fastow's listening, can you order me another clipboard?  Who's Matt Fastow?  Because Travis broke my clipboard.  All right.  I mean, we'll...  Because Matt listens to the after show, so...  What happened with your... 
[03:23:30]  And he does the office supplies here?  Yeah.  What happened to the clipboard that Travis broke it?  I don't know.  It was angry.  Whatever.  I don't know what you're talking about half the time, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Sal.  Yes.  Rough one for you, huh?  Oh, no.  It was within your reach.  It was almost there for you.  It's totally fine.  Here's what happened.  Sal, the intern, he's the good one.  We had Jenna Rose, who's the penthouse pet of the year.  And I'll say this.  I'll go out on a limb and say she's exceptionally good looking. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Somebody was going to get to feel up her boobies.  Well, no shit.  Roland, I'm turning them off.  Listen, it's obvious to you, but it might not be obvious to everybody.  Yeah.  Somebody was going to get to feel up her breasts in substitution for the lousy intern.  Um, and you, your name was brought up.  Yeah.  You were right there.  I got the green light.  But then you realize, like, listen, you can get on management's case for a lot of stuff, 
[03:24:30]  but the OB and Anthony internship experience is not like many in the sense that, you know,  you get to interact with a lot of different people.  You get to do a lot of different things.  I have to say, it's hard to get mad when management says, listen, we can't let these kids who are  here to learn and earn college credit go in and feel up porn stars' titties and choke them.  You can understand where management is coming from with that.  I completely, completely understand, but I'm happy that someone did, and props to Troy 
[03:25:00]  who did a fucking great job.  You were disappointed, though.  Well, I mean, honestly, I mean, you know.  Yeah, it would have been cool if I did.  From a human perspective.  From a human perspective, yeah.  I mean, she's way hotter in person than she is in the magazine.  And she looks good in the magazine, so it's like.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, props to Troy.  Like I said, Troy is fucking doing a really good job.  It was pretty funny, actually.  You like those autographed magazines?  Yeah, I do.  Why don't you take one for yourself?  Aw, thank you.  Why don't you take a magazine for yourself?  Now, there is a chance you might have to, that may be confiscated by management. 
[03:25:30]  I don't know if that's appropriate or not, but still, take a magazine for yourself.  Thank you.  And you can go ahead, here at SiriusXM, all the stalls have locks on the doors.  So go ahead and take that magazine in there and just think about what it would have been  like to touch her.  And can I have Matt clean up the rest of the studio in the meantime?  Actually, I'd rather, to tell you the truth, I'd rather you did it only, and this is only  because I don't want him in here, you know what I mean? 
[03:26:00]  Okay, that's fine.  I'm sorry, Roland, I turned that off.  I didn't.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, and that's the only reason.  I mean, Ant made his feelings on the intern who's not Sal, perfectly well known today.  Can I just say thank you to ONA for even extending that offer.  They both, like, confirmed it.  I thought that was great.  It was really nice, but I totally, you know.  You understand.  I completely understand.  Where's Troy at?  I would like to see, because Troy really came in here like, he was...  Hey, Sam.  Hey, hey, hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Really, Sam?  What's up, Sam?  Troy was in here with Jenna Rose, and we really got a glimpse. 
[03:26:30]  I mean, Troy keeps it real when he's on the air, whether he's making friends or enemies.  He's an honest guy on this radio show.  Is that right?  Right, Troy?  Always.  And, I mean, you came in here, and we did get a taste of, I'll call him Bedroom Troy.  Yeah.  Of what it's like, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Because you weren't, you know, you had a chance.  You got Jenna Rose in here.  Yeah.  Who is...  Gorgeous.  Really.  Unbelievable.  Stunning in person.  And a lot of times, these girls look like hags.  Yeah.  They're really just fucking run through the mill.  But, like Sal said, she looks better. 
[03:27:00]  She looks great in the magazine.  She looks even better in person.  Luckily, she still has youth on her side.  She looks like Britney Spears.  Yeah, she does.  Because a lot of times, some of these broads...  Well, Britney Spears then, not now.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, these girls will just run through the fucking mill.  And it's funny, because on Instagram, too, I follow a couple of porn stars on there.  Do they post, like, nudies?  Nah, not really.  But they post hot shots.  Nudies.  What type of person calls them?  Nudies.  Do they post nudies?  And it's funny, because I think most girls want to be considered, or feel sexy when they're  natural, like, no makeup on. 
[03:27:30]  Okay.  And some of these girls just look like they're run through the fucking mill.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Like you said, I mean, when Jenna Rose said she was born in 1991...  Yeah.  That made me feel old.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I can't imagine for someone like you, but...  So you are...  Well, I'm not that much older than you, but I clearly remember 1991.  I know, so do I.  It's really...  It's a little depressing.  Yeah.  Um, but you came in here.  Uh, the intern rule, which, I mean, is not so much a rule as it is, I mean, kind of like 
[03:28:00]  a law.  Like, it probably...  It's not...  When management says, are we really having interns do this?  All you can say is, you know what?  You're right on this one, I think.  Yeah.  I don't think interns need to...  But staff members, that's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, it sucks for the interns, because that's one of the little perks of, like, okay, I'm doing  this job for free.  Yeah.  You know, oh, man, I get to fill up this penthouse.  Bitch, you know?  But you took the bull by the horn.  I did.  Okay, man.  I had to...  Somebody had to step up to the plate.  The bull by the tits, I'll say.  Yeah.  Um...  I think I may have scared her, too, a little bit. 
[03:28:30]  Were you at all...  Did you start to get any sort of action in the pants there?  No.  Any growth?  No growth.  I mean, obviously, she's an attractive girl.  Did you push against her?  The pelvis?  Not really.  I mean, you don't want to be too much of a fucking creep.  You know what I mean?  It's a fine line.  Because it really is...  It's...  You have to think about her.  Like, she's naked in front of a room of dudes, and the dudes...  Everybody in the room is frothing at the mouth.  Yeah, and she doesn't know what's going on, because one minute, Ant did the classic Ant  where he was...  I wasn't sure if he was going to get mad at you, to tell you the truth. 
[03:29:00]  Because Ant was in classic Ant form, where within five minutes, he said...  He said, I remember this.  He goes, oh, you're from California, too.  We should go out.  And it's like...  It's so great.  But the way he does it is so nonchalant.  It's just like...  I'm just kidding, bud.  Like, this makes sense.  Yeah, we should go out, or...  Hey, you know, I got a bar in my house.  I could see Ant.  I mean, how do I compete with Ant?  I mean, he's...  But then you got Jim, who's doing Chip for half the interview, and she don't know what's  going on with him.  Then you got Opie, who has to make it awkward. 
[03:29:30]  Hang on one sec.  Hotline, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Hey, put me on the phone.  It's Chip on.  Oh, good.  Chip, you're on the air.  Put me on the radio.  It's Chip on.  I heard you the first time.  I already said you're on the air.  We have to fault with the show.  It's on the...  You're on the show right now.  I fucked that girl.  The penthouse girl.  I fucked her.  No, you didn't fuck her.  You mock...  You kind of dry humped her somewhat, but not really. 
[03:30:00]  I fucked her.  No, I didn't.  I took her in the stairs, and I fucked her good...  A couple times.  There's no way you did that.  She's like, I'm gonna come, Chip.  I'm like, yeah, you're gonna come so much, you might start going.  We was laughing.  She called you Chippa?  Yeah, she's calling me Chippa D.  This is what...  What's that?  Well, when I was watching you in action, Chip, and talking how you talk to girls, I was wondering...  Because you let out a couple one-liners while you were mock-fucking her.  Do you ever worry that the girl is gonna laugh at one of your jokes and kind of get thrown out of the mood? 
[03:30:30]  No, because they like to laugh and cum at the same time.  I call it laugh-cumming, and that's what they do.  They laugh and cum all over the place.  I told her, you're gonna be like, there's a bunch of clowns on your pussy or something.  Laugh-cumming is not a clever way to put those two words together.  Yeah, I'm like, you wanna laugh-cum or something, bitch?  I fucked up so good by the steps.  I don't believe you.  I wouldn't lie about that.  I was fucking up, and she was like, oh, you're fucking me so much better than the Playboy people did. 
[03:31:00]  It's Penthouse, Chip.  She's on the cover of this month's Penthouse.  What's that?  Penthouse.  Never mind.  What did you think?  You got to see Troy in action right before you were in action.  What do you think of the way he handles the women?  It's pretty lame.  You don't know what he's doing.  He's all trying to whisper in her ear.  You just got to yell that stuff.  Like, what would you yell?  I'm fucking you're good, huh?  Take these.  What do you like?  These apples or something?  Oh, that's actually pretty good. 
[03:31:30]  I didn't even think the apples angle is a good route to go down.  I told her, I feel you pussy like it's a lifeboat, and my dick is a bunch of survivors.  That's horrible.  That's not even like...  Do you ever get bashful saying all this stuff publicly?  Because usually, you know, this is intimate stuff.  I say, I told her, my you-know-what is like the Titanic.  I'm going to stick it right in the ocean until the body's falling out of it. 
[03:32:00]  She gets it.  My first problem was that you called it a you-know-what while you were fucking this girl.  And the second problem was a Titanic reference where you bring up all the people that died.  Well, you know, you kind of pay homage, you know?  Well, thank you very much, Chip.  Thanks.  What are you, wrapping up or something?  Yeah, I'm wrapping you up.  I mean, that was a good line to go out on.  No, I got a good line to go out on.  Okay.  I would be out of Titanic. 
[03:32:30]  So I'm like, I don't take sinking ships.  That was a horrible line to go out on.  You had it.  I just followed up with something better.  No, you didn't.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  Where are you going?  I'm going to hang up the phone on you, Chip.  Hey, how about some Argentium or something?  Yeah.  I wish you had to read it in front of you, because I would let you read it right now.  I don't know how to do it.  Hey, Stephen, you want some Argentium? 
[03:33:00]  Real silver's made out of copper and, like, and hats.  But Argentium is made out of silver that they shine up and stuff.  That's right.  Where can they get it?  What's that?  Where can they get the Argentium?  It's from that one corner on Walnut and 37th Street.  No, it's 8th.  8th and Walnut is their address.  Other corner.  Stephen Drummer.  No, Stephen Singer.  Stephen Singer.  You know where his website is?  Yeah, it's like you can get the silver, you can get the Argentium. 
[03:33:30]  No, it's Super Silver.  Oh, the website?  Yeah.  I think it's Stephen's Jewelry Place or something.  It's IHateStevenSinger.com is the answer.  What's that?  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Okay.  Okay, and then what's the phone number, Chip?  Stephen Singer.  Hey, what is he in a band or something?  It's 888.  You should go out on that.  It's a good joke.  No, we got to finish the read. 
[03:34:00]  You can't go out on it.  It's 888.  IHateStevenSinger.  He's on the other corner.  He's on the other corner of A.C.  And Walnut.  Walnut.  Walnut.  Yeah.  What's up with this nut on the wall?  What is he?  What is he in a nut house or something?  Well, you'd think...  A big laugh.  You'd think he was in the nut house how low his prices are.  What's that?  His prices are low, Chip.  That's all I'm saying.  He offers jewelry at very discounted prices.  That's stupid.  No, it's not stupid. 
[03:34:30]  It's a service to the people.  And he especially likes, you know, ONA fans and fans after ONA Live.  We should have went out on the big laugh.  I said the Argentium joke was good.  All right, so why don't we end this with...  I guess you could redo it.  All right.  Hey, Steven Singer's got some Argentium.  What's the matter?  Did somebody steal all of silver?  That doesn't make any sense.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  That's it.  Okay.  Chip, thank you for helping me out with that. 
[03:35:00]  What's that?  Thank you for helping me out with the read.  Eh, sure.  You know.  I'll try to get you some bucks for it.  Yeah, see if you can get me a few clams.  Good one.  I love the way you use slang.  Get some dollarinis.  I got you.  All right, well, thanks for calling in, Chip.  All right, yeah, sure.  I'm going to hang up now.  Chad.  Okay, bye.  That was good.  I did try.  You're still on the phone.  They love when I call up. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  It was crazy.  What's that?  You're still on the air.  No, I hung up already.  No, you didn't hit the button, Chip.  I'm just telling Kenny how good I did.  You didn't do that great.  You're still on the air.  That's how we're talking.  How come there are those people in the city?  Chip, I'm going to hang up on you now.  They shouldn't be done.  I didn't even hear it.  All right, Chip.  Thanks for calling in.  Okay.  All right, bye. 
[03:36:00]  See ya.  I hate that motherfucker.  Chip, I'm right here.  You called me.  Hang up.  What's he doing?  Hang up the phone.  You stop.  I'm listening to the radio.  Okay, he's gone.  Okay, he's gone.  Thank God.  Troy, Chip, with some harsh words for your performance. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, it's okay.  You don't mind.  It's hard to fuck with Chip, you know?  Yeah.  It's because it's not so much that you feel like your performance was under his, but it's  more like, if I start fucking with him, he's going to fuck with me back, and once those  zingers start coming.  It's a fight I don't really want to pick with Chip.  Is it awkward for you to come in here and have to show how you would perform sexually on  her while she's nude in front of all of us?  Well, of course, because these guys are just waiting to fucking demolish you for whatever 
[03:37:00]  you do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  But you came in here, like Anthony described Ron Bennington as cocksure the other day.  Yeah.  You were cocksure this morning.  Oh, I think I fuck pretty good, so.  You do?  I don't know.  Roland?  What?  Does Troy fuck good?  Fantastic.  Okay, good.  I mean, Roland usually doesn't like a dick in the ass, but from Troy...  He'll take it.  It's all the technique, am I right?  The cloth.  The cloth.  And what was the vibe after that's all done? 
[03:37:30]  Well, it is weird, because, you know, she's sitting there, she puts her clothes back on,  and then it's like, oh, cool, thank you, all right.  You know, it's just...  I don't know.  It's weird, yeah.  Did we experience something here?  Yeah.  Was there a spark?  Between me and her?  No, I don't think so.  No, there was no romance there?  When he walked by, she said, oh, who's that?  I go, that's her resident hunk.  No.  You called him a hunk?  He was.  I don't believe him.  I think we had an argument a few weeks ago about who's the cool guy on the show.  Oh, boy.  Are we going down this road again?  No, no, no.  That didn't go well.  I would think you're the hunk on the show, though. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  I think Roland's right about that.  Yeah, he's like the Fonzie.  Who else would be the hunk, then?  Sex.  You think sex is the hunk?  Sex, well, after the blonde, no.  Eric, how did you feel when Penthouse Pet of the Year Jenna Rose came in here and said  that your hair made you look like a lesbian?  Well, I told Roland outside that I realized my hair looks like Tank Girl.  Yeah, it does look a little like Tank Girl.  What was that actress's name?  Lori Petty?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it kind of fits in the whole lesbian motif.  How do you think people have been a little unfair with their reactions to your new do? 
[03:38:30]  No, I didn't expect anyone to like this.  Well, what is it?  Is it, like, Troy brought up to me when he sent me a message.  For those that don't know, E-Rock, the sex bagel, the sex man, Prince Nagel, came into  work yesterday after taking a four-day weekend with bleach blonde hair.  Uh, so we've all been reacting, uh, to it in different ways.  Troy, you messaged me and said you think it's because E-Rock back in the day, in the 
[03:39:00]  90s, when he was cool, or thought he was cool, had his bleach blonde hair.  I think I may even have a picture here of him with blonde hair.  He used to do this a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, back in the day.  Because we haven't seen him like this in, I mean, seven years.  When was the last time you did that?  Uh, 2004, right before the show started.  But you used to do it a lot.  Um, yeah, I used to do the, uh, the blonde mixed into my regular hair color.  I never did it like this.  So, do you think, Troy, that he's trying to get back to those cool days? 
[03:39:30]  Well, I think, here's what I think, and I don't know, I can't speak for Eric, but  you know how people from the 80s, sometimes what they thought made them cool in the 80s  still works, or whatever era, like, um, like people that had mullets.  Yeah.  You know, like, they'll still rock a mullet because in high school, that was cool, man.  Right, like when Billy Ray Cyrus brings his mullet back, he's at a certain age now, times  have changed now, it doesn't exactly work anymore. 
[03:40:00]  Right, or like, you know, dudes that still rock mustaches, not for the ironic way, but  like, they're still rocking it because in the 70s, you had a mustache.  Tom Selleck.  Yeah, exactly.  Burt Reynolds.  Exactly.  So, in the 90s, you have to think what was cool then.  It was, you know, everybody bleached blonde in their hair like Eminem.  Yeah, I mean, this is true.  This hasn't been a great look since at least...  98, 99.  I would say you could go as far as 2001.  You'd still be, you'd be a little lame, like, you'd be, you'd be at the end of the spectrum. 
[03:40:30]  You're on the end of it, yeah.  But still acceptable.  Um, are you trying to, is that what you're trying to do with Iraq?  Trying to relive some of those...  But like, I was trying to say, I don't mean to cut Eric off, but those were his sort of  glory days.  That's when he was sort of like, he was young, he was badass.  Was he a cool guy?  You knew him then.  Yeah, he was, he was cool.  I mean, yeah, he did his, he did his thing.  You know what I mean?  Like, but, you know, he, he, he kind of rolled with some people that, you know, that was kind  of the, had a little bit of an edge and, and dyed their hair blonde at that time. 
[03:41:00]  And that kind of what gave him like a, oh, this guy's different.  You know what I mean?  So...  And you're saying that like, I think he's...  That edge is kind of, is kind of lost.  Yeah.  I think he kind of wants to come back to it.  Like, look, I'm still, I'm still a little, I have a little bit of an edge still.  Do you have a rambutious E-Rock story about his edge?  No.  I don't think.  Was he a take no shit type of guy though?  Uh, I mean...  He was still kind of sex bagley.  I mean, he's, he was sex bagley.  I mean...  He was.  Yeah.  But he just felt like he had a little more edge. 
[03:41:30]  Eric, are you trying to do, is that, is Troy accurate at all?  That I'm trying to go back to, to that time period?  No, not that you're trying to bring everybody back, but like mentally, you felt like in the  late nineties, you were a little more edgy, you were a little cool, you had youth on your  side, you were like, you had your fingers up, fuck you, I'm fucking Eric Nagel, I'm the  man, I'm gonna go...  We're gonna take over the world.  Yeah, I'm gonna accomplish this shit, I'm gonna get er done.  I have a boat.  Yeah, I have a fucking boat, motherfucker. 
[03:42:00]  Who comes to Florida and doesn't stop by my house?  That guy, Eric.  That guy.  Not the 40 year old man we see in front of us.  I've been in Florida at that time.  Okay.  You must have been on a trip or something.  But not the guy that we see in front of us.  Is this, are you trying to bring back, fuck the world, I have bleach blonde hair because  it was cool then, Eric Nagel?  No.  You're not?  No.  Because back then, I, I, back then I, I didn't do it to this extent. 
[03:42:30]  Where the whole, whole head was just this, like, blonde.  See, I don't, I don't, I, I remember differently.  But it's not so much like...  No, I did blonde with, like, colors mixed in, but I never did.  No, I, I, I've seen you completely blonde.  But either way...  I think I even have pictures of it.  It's not, the hue is not what we're debating.  Right.  It's the mental state.  No, I'm not trying, I'm not trying to go back to that time period in my life.  You're not trying to get a little of that edge back?  No, not at all.  I mean, you've lost the edge since you've been on the show.  You understand that?  Like, you're not somebody that people would refer to as edgy anymore. 
[03:43:00]  Okay.  Is that something that you want to have back?  No.  You don't want to be an edgy guy?  No.  What did you say, Paul?  Eric compared it to getting a tattoo this morning when he described it to me.  You consider this like getting a tattoo?  Yeah, no, as far as the impulse of it, like, I was just, I kept saying, I'm going to do  it, I'm going to do it, and then finally I went and did it.  After a few cosmos.  And it's like people who go and get, like, a really bad tattoo on an impulse.  You know, like, that never had a tattoo. 
[03:43:30]  They're like, I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it.  Finally, they went out and fucking did it.  You're like a sorority girl who couldn't handle her liquor one night.  Sure, why not?  Like, what do you mean a bad tattoo on an impulse?  Are you talking about Troy's DeLorean logo again?  No.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  I'm just kidding.  I mean, my thing is, if you're going to do it, why would you rock a hat?  Like, why wouldn't you just, why wouldn't you have it styled and come in here guns fucking  blazing?  Because Jim hadn't seen it yet.  Yeah, but what about yesterday when Jim wasn't here?  Because they hadn't seen it yet.  Well, what's the difference?  Why wouldn't you just walk in and be like, here it is? 
[03:44:00]  Presentation.  Yeah, I get that.  Is that when you want it styled as opposed to hat head?  No, because they didn't know I had it until later in the show.  Yeah, but if you walk into the goddamn studio in the morning...  Then the reactions one is not on the air.  Then they'll talk about it as soon as they fucking light up the mics.  Because they want the reaction on the air.  Oh, okay.  Eric has, he's got an argument there.  I mean, I would definitely say, especially today, you want Jim's argument.  I mean, I could say, whether it's true or not, who knows, but I would definitely say  Eric's got a strong enough argument that, you know, he might have been saving it for 
[03:44:30]  the air, and I would have hoped that he would have.  So, I get that.  But, and I will say, he doesn't seem ashamed of this.  Because like, when he was around asking everybody what they thought of his new hairdo, this wasn't  something that I concocted.  Like, Eric was showing people his haircut.  Right.  And then I grabbed a recorder.  So, I don't think he's, he's not hiding it.  I just think that, I don't think that he's being truthful about the motivations.  Like, some people have been saying, Sam, like, you have wacky hair too. 
[03:45:00]  But it's not like I had a buzz cut, and then one day I came in with giant hair.  Right.  This is just what I've transitioned into, and this is how I'm comfortable now.  Right.  And that's actually how the hair comes out of your head, and you just choose to keep it longer.  Right.  Like, I didn't say, I need, I want to do this because I, you know, I need a change.  Right.  You know, when people make drastic changes, there is a catalyst.  Like, when you get a tattoo.  Especially in your 30s.  Yeah.  When you do it as a kid, you're just trying to find out who you are as a human being.  Right.  There is something that you're trying to get through this way. 
[03:45:30]  Like, when you get a tattoo at, you know, after you're 28, say.  Right.  Like, if I got a tattoo at 28, there would be something behind it.  Like, even if it was a dumb tattoo, it's like, okay.  I got this because of this.  Or, you know, like, Sam, honestly, let's break this down.  You got that because you want to be edgier.  You want to be this.  You don't feel comfortable in that.  I, I, Eric, I think there's a reason.  There's no reason.  And you're, you're looking way too into this. 
[03:46:00]  And you know the fact that I've been talking about doing this for a while.  Eric was talking about it for a long time.  And then I just finally go, you know what?  I'm going to finally do it now.  Yeah.  And I did it.  That was it.  It was just, there's no, like, underline behind it.  Like, well, what was the motivation?  There's got to be something that forced you to do it.  Tell me if Brandon in Missouri is right.  He's feedbacking in.  Eric is bringing sexy back.  Is that what the goal is?  No, that's not.  And you said that the other day.  I did?  Yeah.  You said that to me on Tuesday.  You know what I said off the air that I wish I had said on the air? 
[03:46:30]  When we were doing E-Rock jokes.  That E-Rock now looks like the lead singer of My Chemical Sweetener Romance.  That's a good one.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I just wanted to share that with everybody.  No, I know.  You understand.  Because you ran, no, we were in the office and you got all mad at yourself.  Because I didn't say it on the air.  Oh, I got to tell you this.  And he's like, no offense, but.  And then you played that out.  No offense, but here's an insult.  This is, I thought we should replay.  Eric bleached his hair and he was going around showing all the girls at SiriusXM his new haircut and his new hairdo. 
[03:47:00]  I wanted to document that for all the listeners and to get a poll.  Because, look, the problem here is that no matter what Eric did to his hair, his self, no matter what he did, he'd get shit on it for it here.  Right, Eric?  Like, you knew that going in.  It doesn't matter.  No.  Like, you will get shit on for it here.  Yeah.  On the show.  So, I wanted to see, let's go outside the show. 
[03:47:30]  Let's hear what the, you know, the friendly people on the music channels or whatever, Eric's, people he's cool with, are saying about it.  And this is what we recorded.  Julia from XMU.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  You know the sex bagel, Eric Nagel, right?  I love the sex bagel, Eric Nagel.  Wait till you see his new hairdo.  Show him, E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Why did you do that?  Alex D, producer extraordinaire for SiriusXM Hits 1.  You know, Eric the sex bagel, right? 
[03:48:00]  Of course.  Show him your new haircut.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  I am speechless.  What?  What did you do?  Speechless in, like, a horrible way.  I don't know.  It's just so different.  Taylor from Wake Up With Taylor.  Hey, what's up?  You know E-Rock, right?  Sex bagel.  What?  Who?  The sex bagel.  The sex bagel?  Yeah, Eric Nagel.  No, I didn't know you, the sex bagel. 
[03:48:30]  Have you ever met him before?  Never.  Okay, well, then tell me what you think of his look.  Take off your hat, Eric.  Oh, wow.  You look like, are you gay?  You look like a fabulous gay man.  I like it.  That's a compliment.  Yeah, it is.  I like it, though.  I mean, if you're, you know, if you're going to go dance in a cage tonight, I like it.  Mean it from the heat.  What do you think of E-Rock's hair?  It's interesting.  You don't like it.  It doesn't match his skin tone.  As a female, do you find him more or less attractive physically? 
[03:49:00]  I don't want to hurt his feelings.  So that's less, then.  Sam, I don't.  Yes.  Are you going through it?  What's that, Eric?  I'll answer it for you.  Yes, that would be less.  Wow, Madison from Alt Nation.  You know E-Rock the Sex Bagel, don't you?  Yeah.  He just looked at my tits.  You bet he did.  All right.  Now I'm done.  Well, you remember what he used to look like, right?  Yeah.  Take off your hat, E-Rock.  Oh.  My.  Ah!  What the fuck, man? 
[03:49:30]  Madal from Dirty Dog.  You know E-Rock, right?  Yes.  You know what he looks like, right?  Or what he looked like, I should say.  Yes.  Take off your hat.  What?  What is that?  Why did you do that?  He bleached it.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan.  No.  No.  Not at all.  I don't even have to squeeze that out of you.  I liked her.  Yeah.  Because she was just like the most honest, unapologetic. 
[03:50:00]  Those were the women of SiriusXM hearing about, or seeing E-Rock's new hairdo for the first  time after he bleached it.  You know what I'd love to see?  If you're going to make a statement and you're going to be like, okay, I'm going to do something  crazy.  Wouldn't you love to see Eric, okay, he bleaches his hair, he comes in with like a fucking  throat tattoo, you know, or like starts wearing like leather coats.  Yeah.  And it gets you jacked.  And chains dripping off the sleeves.  And he's just like, and you're like, dude, what the fuck?  He's like, fuck you.  Do something about it then. 
[03:50:30]  Hit his chest.  Do something about it.  Fucking stupid.  And then he'd be like, whoa, what the fuck is this?  But I really liked when Taylor from Cosmo Radio, who had never met Eric before,  asked if he was gay.  Yeah.  Based on the haircut.  Yeah, I could see that.  That's a very flamboyant.  You think so?  Yeah.  Eric, are you at all thinking that you're going to go this route that Troy discussed of,  fuck you guys.  I'm the bully around the block.  Like you thought Troy was the Fonz.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Like this, that's like the equivalent to like putting in a fluorescent laces in your 
[03:51:00]  shoes.  Yeah.  You're like, I'm wild.  But it's like, dude, it's just laces.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Like take the, take the plunge.  Like, would you get like a, like a, you know, a leather jacket with a big dead Kennedy's  patch on the back?  And like, you know, tight jeans cut off at the shins with Doc Martens and just start  gelling your hair and get jacked up and throw the fingers up.  Fuck you guys.  Sons of Anarchy.  Wow.  I mean, that's a little more punk than Sons of Anarchy.  But, uh, Eric?  Yeah, I don't think that's me. 
[03:51:30]  Okay.  It's not, okay.  It's not you.  Well, um, how did you feel about the reaction to the, the, the girls had?  Um, pretty much what I expected.  Why?  Other than Taylor's comments, but yeah.  You didn't think, you didn't, you thought people would dislike it, but you didn't think  the gay thing.  I think I've met her before, but maybe I didn't.  She didn't make an impact.  No, um, well, I mean, I got to commend you on one level that you've, you've, you've taken  Roland, Roland was asleep in here a minute ago. 
[03:52:00]  He's just, you're so unhealthy, Roland.  You're just, I fear for you all the time because you are so unhealthy.  But as I was saying about Iraq, um, and, and that's only cause I love you.  I'm praying for Iraq too.  You are.  You think, um, I got to respect the fact that he's coming in and he's like, yeah, I knew  I would get shit on for this, but I just want to.  So that's it.  It's kind of cool.  Do you think he just, he's in need of attention?  No, cause I'm not, I'm not looking for airtime.  I'm not looking to be more of a, uh, fixture for, uh, for the barbs of this show. 
[03:52:30]  Louis C.K. brought that up on the show yesterday.  Yeah.  I don't think, Eric's never been the attention guy like some of our interns have been.  He's not the guy.  But that's an honest assessment coming from Louis.  No, it is.  I'm not, I'm not saying that Louis was, you know, because he doesn't know you.  Yeah, he doesn't know.  Like the rest of us know you.  Eric doesn't go for negative attention and he gets plenty of attention.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's like when people said I was jealous of intern Matt for the airtime. 
[03:53:00]  And I was like, guys, like, I have a show.  Yeah.  Like I do the whole 10 o'clock hour.  I'm not, I'm not at the point where I'm jealous of people for airtime anymore.  Can I throw a theory out there?  Yeah.  Tell me what you think about this.  Ooh.  Okay.  Eric maybe hasn't had an increase of Twitter followers lately.  Just hear me out.  Hear me out.  Hear me out.  And you know, and you know, Sam, in his world, that's one of the most important things.  I didn't know.  You're definitely right about that.  Is it really?  Because that's sort of, well, that's sort of, I'm going to tell you why. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to explain it to you because that's sort of your clout on this show.  It's sort of like, here's my, here's where I am in this world.  Like, here's how many the hosts have.  That's right.  And the staff, this is where, this is my rank.  I never bring that up.  You never bring it up, but you know that that's important to you.  It's not important.  No, that's bullshit, Eric.  If that was important, why I'd be Twittering about what TV shows I watched?  No, that's bullshit.  Because there's nothing else to put on it.  You give away, hang on, you give away stuff on your Twitter all the time.  You don't do that as a service. 
[03:54:00]  You don't do that because you're nice.  You do that because you want people to follow you.  You give away stuff that you find in the office.  That's because you want more Twitter followers.  Yeah, no shit, I don't want it in the office.  Because you want more Twitter followers.  And that's why you get stuff extra signed, because you want to give it away on your Twitter.  So you're thinking that maybe he wanted people like Jim to take a picture, then he tweeted  at E-Rock Radio.  Well, because it was good that Jim wasn't here, because he knew that he would at least get  one Opie tweet.  And then get a Jim tweet the next day.  And then possibly get other stuff, because then you gave him an Instagram tweet.  Yes, I did. 
[03:54:30]  Okay, you're really overthinking.  Well, I mean, hey, it's just a theory.  I asked Sam what he thought of my theory.  Why don't you plug your Twitter?  Oh, E-Rock Radio.  There you go, you'll get some.  Not Sam, E-Rock Radio.  Troy Kwan.  Spelled Q-U-A-N.  Well, yeah, we got to take off.  But also, while you're online, I wanted to mention this earlier.  Maybe I'll talk about it tomorrow.  I think it was, I don't remember.  I was walking around with Opie, I think it was a few weeks ago at this point.  But we ran into this homeless guy that just kicks things and kicks at people. 
[03:55:00]  He's a maniac.  Like, a guy, he dropped a newspaper, and this guy came up to him and said, here, you dropped  your newspaper.  And the homeless dude started kicking him.  Like, he just kicks people.  That's what he does.  He kicks things and people, and he spits.  That's right, Roland.  You've seen this guy.  Yeah, we follow him.  He's out all the time.  Opie took a video of him.  I don't know why he didn't bring it up on the air today.  I thought he was going to.  But you've got to see it.  It's on the Opie Radio channel.  Because Opie thinks that his video camera is like a force field. 
[03:55:30]  Like a bulletproof shield.  Nothing bad can happen to him, as long as he's got his video camera between him and this  maniac.  Because he got right in the guy's face.  I was in there.  He was like, let's follow this guy.  I was like, oh, can't we just keep walking?  He's like, no, no, no.  We've got to get this video.  And at first, he's just in the background, like way far behind.  Then he starts running up to this guy and making like, huh, huh, sounds right in the  dude's face.  It's amazing.  It's called...  Opie's dedicated to his craft.  It's amazing, dude.  And that's one of Opie's biggest strengths, is that he is not afraid to get into somebody's 
[03:56:00]  face.  I saw one guy with a girl, last time he followed me, he almost slapped the guy.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  It's called Homeless Lunatic on his YouTube page.  He has the same guy.  He has the same four blocks.  Yeah.  He won't go past that.  We'll talk about it tomorrow on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Nobody does nothing.
