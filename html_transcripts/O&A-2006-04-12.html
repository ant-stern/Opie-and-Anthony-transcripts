<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the listener contest, "WOW" stickers, and detailed instructions on how to obtain them from Mr. H.  This was followed by a discussion of Bruce Mittman cancelling a planned appearance and dinner.  A significant portion of the show focused on the increasingly erratic behavior of staffer Twitchels, who has Tourette's Syndrome and was exhibiting violent self-harm, particularly slapping himself. The hosts discussed the authenticity of his actions, recounted pranks played on him (Icy Hot and grape jelly), and dismissed a caller, Frank, who doubted Twitchels' condition.  The Yankee game they attended was discussed, featuring commentary on announcer John Sterling and a home run clip.  The hosts also talked about "Frenchie," a former show regular, describing his failed restaurant and culinary school aspirations, and his annoying attempts to engage Anthony after the show. Opie's brother's generosity at FH Riley's contrasted sharply with Opie's own stinginess, sparking listener calls about both the restaurant and their own experiences with massage parlors, often detailing explicit encounters, including Jimmy's humorous account of negotiating a handjob during a massage.  The "Whip Him Out Wednesday" promotional segment was also aired.

The show continued with more listener calls about negative massage parlor experiences, ranging from unsatisfactory masseuses to theft, including one caller whose hair was set on fire by a prostitute.  Twitchels, in the studio, became the focus, with the hosts attempting to "cure" his self-slapping tics by covering his hands in various sticky substances (ketchup, jelly, honey, pudding). This proved unsuccessful, resulting in a messy situation involving Twitchels, Patrice O'Neal (who was a guest), and studio equipment.  An unrelated clip of Earl Weaver using extremely profane language was also played.  Twitchell's upcoming comedy show was promoted.

Further attempts to "cure" Twitchels involved covering him in icing, chocolate pudding, and Danny's pubic hair, leading to chaotic scenes and Twitchels being sent outside, covered in the substances and pubic hair.  Patrice O'Neal and Alan Light were both present in the studio during this segment.  Other topics included a discussion about a comedy show at the Laugh Factory, a critique of Mets merchandise, and a heated discussion about perceived racial bias on American Idol, involving a disagreement with comedian Dice Cleavland.

A substantial portion of the show centered on a discussion of American Idol, with Patrice O'Neal, and the hosts criticizing contestants, particularly Taylor Hicks, Ace Young, and Mandisa. They discussed alleged bias towards white contestants and the prioritizing of image over talent.  O'Neal used homophobic and racist slurs.  A phone call with Dennis Leary followed, discussing his work on *Ice Age* and *Rescue Me*, punctuated by comedic banter.  O'Neal frequently joined the conversation, and the discussion included further commentary on race and sexuality.  The censorship of Rolling Stones songs in China, specifically the offensive lyrics of "Brown Sugar" related to slavery, was also analyzed in detail, leading to more discussions on racial themes and offensive jokes. An intern attempted a Stephen Wright impression and Alan Light remained in studio throughout this segment.

The show concluded with a comparison of a guest's imitation of Stephen Wright to recordings of Wright himself.  Twitchels recounted a graphic bathroom mishap involving pubic hair and promoted his "Short Bus Comedy Tour."  Numerous listener calls followed, featuring more vulgar and sexually suggestive jokes and comments.  The show ended with plugs for Twitchels' show and Bodog.com.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Is that your little brother? 
[00:05:00]  Is that your little brother?  Is that your little brother?  Is that your little brother?  Sure.  He's a good-looking kid.  Hi.  Hello, cutie pie.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun.  You're like discipline.  You're like discipline.  I'm the party pooper. 
[00:05:30]  I said party pooper.  You're like...  You dick.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Hey, good morning.  And welcome to the O&A program.  Hi.  On XM satellite radio.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We love that.  That's what they call it.  It is a virus and it spreads nicely on a daily basis. 
[00:06:00]  You pass it on like a...  The flu.  Like the flu.  Like the dangerous bird flu.  Scary bird flu.  Where'd that go?  It never really took off.  Nah, it didn't have legs.  It never took flight.  Awful bird.  The bird flu was perched all winter.  Or in a cage.  In a cage.  Like a little Tweety bird.  A safe little Tweety bird.  But thanks for the scare. 
[00:06:30]  It was fun, everybody.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you for scaring the shit out of us.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mr. H.  Mr. H, what's up?  Good morning, b-b-boys.  B-b-b-boys.  You know, Bruce Mittman was supposed to be on our show, but he canceled.  Bruce Mittman canceled on us?  Our old boss that's probably a midget.  Yeah, technically.  What's up his ass that he rescheduled?  He rescheduled. 
[00:07:00]  He was going to take us out to dinner, and then he was going to come on the show so we  can make fun of him.  We do that every two or three years.  Maybe he was on to us.  Well, we're going to be in Boston, and he's living up there, so maybe he'll stop by our  Boston show.  Drop by.  Hello, boys.  Are these your fans now?  Oh, I see you got some fans now.  You know, I was the one that said they should start talking more.  Yeah, sure you were.  Sure.  Sure you are, Bruce.  Shut up and take another hit of Ozone's joint. 
[00:07:30]  Like smoking the marijuana.  What, two inside?  What?  Mr. H, go ahead.  Good morning, everybody.  And for the older test, this is going to be a review.  For the new people, perk up and pay attention.  If you want to see delicious mammalian protuberances of the feminine variety, you will need to get  your hands on a wow sticker or some sort of wow symbol in order to spread the virus. 
[00:08:00]  This can be achieved by scrawling wow in the back of your vehicle in the dirt that collects  there.  My personal favorite, of course, the semi.  Yes.  Or you can be fancy like myself and send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 111 West 57th  Street, New York, New York.  And I believe the zip code is 10018.  Or you can serve to www.opinanthony.com, the nexus of all great in the universe, and 
[00:08:30]  click on the wow sticker link, fill out the online form, and one will arrive, and you  can stick that on the back of your method of conveyance.  Boys, thank you very much.  Conveyance.  You're the drill though today.  Hey, that's not bad, Mr. H.  Thank you.  Drill though?  Yes, please.  Oh, you want us to just play it?  At some point today. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, he did do a good job explaining wow.  We should probably grant him that now, later.  Thank you, boys.  You suck.  No, what we can do is just play requests today.  Things we haven't played in a while.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No.  A talk show that plays requests.  No.  Why not?  Because I was thinking like, you know, baseball began, obviously, Yankees home opener.  Yes, Derek Jeter.  And we didn't break out all our great baseball clips.  Which ones do we have?  Oh, we got like the Earl Weaver.  That's true.  And we have the Earl Weaver. 
[00:09:30]  And then there's the...  Yeah, that's all I can remember is kind of one good baseball clip.  The Earl Weaver.  Now we might have others.  Oh, here we go.  Of course we got the John Sterling.  Yeah.  Ooh.  John Sterling, one of the greatest baseball announcers.  Um, not ever.  No, that's not true.  He could be very good when he's not sucking.  He stinks.  No, but he's good when he's good.  Yeah, he's not.  When he's really bad, you're like, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  But when he's good, you're like, that's really a good call.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's weird.  It's really disappointing.  Wow, you have a love-hate relationship with him.  I do, because he's very good when he's not doing his own shtick.  Hey, I didn't say...  What did he say when Jambi hit his home run last night?  I wouldn't know.  Jambino.  I'm sure it was a Jambino.  Well, I don't know, but we have the, uh, we have this from a past game.  Now, the 1-1.  Swung on there, goes to right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, he's done it again.  Jason Jambi, and boy, did he hit a shot.  Oh, way out in right field.  He timed a fastball and drilled it out.  It is a three-run homer for Jason Jambi.  There's Jambino, and the Yankees take a 5-4 lead.  Do you know my head is tingling right now?  Jimmy can't even look.  He shields his eyes away when that clip is being played. 
[00:11:00]  It's the end of Cuckoo's Nest every time I hear it.  It's, it's, Jack, just, just leave the hotel.  Don't go and choke Nurse Ratched.  Leave the institution.  Yeah, it's very frustrating.  The Yankees need, like, an old-school announcer.  They have such a history to them.  Here's what they need to do.  They need to sit him down and go, stop that.  Enough.  If Bernie goes boom and set again, you're fired.  Bernie goes boom.  Make him hit his face a million times.  By the way, you got to stop on Whackbag. 
[00:11:30]  People think that, like, Twitchells isn't for real.  You got to stop.  The guy is as real as they come.  Yeah.  They're questioning if it's an act and stuff.  The show ended yesterday, and we have tons of video of him just smacking himself in the face.  I heard there were embarrassing rides with him on the elevator.  Oh, yeah.  Like, people had to stand there while the elevator was going down, stopping on each floor, and people were getting in, and he's just going,  brr, brr, brr, brr, smacking himself, getting off on the next floor. 
[00:12:00]  I walked out of the building.  There were no cameras.  There was no radio show.  And there he is in front of everybody out on the streets of Manhattan, slapping the crap out of his face because he couldn't calm down.  Yeah.  His face was beet red by the time he left.  Beet red.  Yep.  And they continue on the message boards with their silliness.  It's not an act.  Yeah.  You got to trust us.  Mm-hmm.  It's not an act.  That is him.  It was fun getting them all excited, like, the guys are going to be there, and he would just, grr, crack his own face. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, he started losing it.  And I thought the slap thing was kind of funny, but then it got really vicious, and it wasn't funny anymore.  He was smacking himself with two hands at the same time really hard.  Which amounts to, like, just about a punch.  Yeah.  Slap both sides of your face like that.  There's no give.  And we're so twisted.  At the end of the show, we're like, hmm, what can we put in his hand?  Yeah.  Thumbtacks.  Because quickly, we got some Icy Hot in his hands.  We?  You did. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, good.  But it's a show.  We.  We're in this together.  Right.  Collective we.  Collective we.  But then Jimmy's like, we should get jelly.  Make it all sticky and...  Just grape jelly in the palm of his hands.  Yeah, I was saying how embarrassing it is to be in the bathroom when he's in there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I go into the bathroom, take a leak, and he's in there, and some guy from one of the  offices up here is taking a dump, and all you're hearing is, ugh, I, I, I, I, I, I, 
[00:13:30]  sounds like the three stooges fucking with each other in the, in the bathroom.  Come on, pocket pine, bend over.  Don't make me break out the Tourette's whorehouse call.  Wait, Liz, at the urinal, I always like to start going, jump.  He's got to jump with his hog on his hand.  He's all over himself.  What do you got, Danny?  Well, I was just going to say the elevator rides are quite fun with Twitchels,  especially at about ten after nine when the elevator is packed and stops at about six floors. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  And, you know, you can tell that he tries to control it because the minute you get into the elevator,  you know, he's trying to concentrate on being quiet.  And the longer he goes, the more it starts.  So he starts going, you know, t-t-t-t-t.  And now everybody starts to look at him because they're like, what the fuck is this kid doing?  And, you know, by the time you hit the third floor, he's going.  Yeah, he gets a big outburst.  Because he can't hold it in anymore.  That's the best way he tries to hold it in.  Then we had another moment after the show yesterday. 
[00:14:30]  I actually slipped out of the studio into the elevator without my escort, Master Poe.  And everybody, of course, found it very funny because I went down with the staff in the elevator.  And they were like, where's Poe?  I go, oh, man, I didn't even realize I got in the elevator.  No Poe.  So we're walking down the hallway to go outside.  And I'm thinking, how funny would it be if I just lay down on the sidewalk like somebody hit me and Poe came out and saw me just sprawled out on the sidewalk? 
[00:15:00]  He gets panicked when he doesn't escort me to the parking garage.  And then you know me.  I don't like talking to people after the show.  I kind of just want to listen to Fox News on my phone, whatever it is.  Stupid Frenchie.  Stupid Frenchie was here yesterday. 
[00:15:30]  Remember him?  Yeah.  Remember him from the pre-millennium?  He used to be a huge star.  Used to be a star on the show.  On the O.P. Anthony program.  And now no one really seems to care about him.  Now he's just a dud.  Now he just shows up and we don't even acknowledge him.  Shows up.  He wants to be on the air, but sorry.  Just ain't happening.  He doesn't have it anymore.  He's like a has-been.  He's an old ball player.  Right.  Old ball player.  Yeah.  Some of those old actors that all of a sudden you see on TV and go, oh my God, whatever  happened to him?  What happened to that guy?  I remember that guy.  That guy had a couple of shining moments. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, Frenchie's one of those guys now.  He's one of those guys.  And dude, he wouldn't shut up the entire way.  And I'm just getting more and more.  Like, can't you see?  Can you see?  I got a phone to my ear and it's 60 degrees and my hood is up and I'm not looking at  anybody and he didn't get it.  He just didn't get it.  How about, was he talking about how you can go to his fucking dumb French restaurant and  get no money off the bill?  No.  Because now he doesn't even have that. 
[00:16:30]  He doesn't have that anymore.  Apparently he's lost that job.  He's looking to go to culinary school.  Good luck to you.  Hope a student stabs you.  But doesn't he already have the skills?  Yeah, but he's looking to be a teacher.  Can that be good?  Now remember, when friends come in, do not take a penny off the check.  Offer to get them a chocolate chip cookie at the end of the whole thing.  Suck it. 
[00:17:00]  That was always an unbelievable thing.  Come down.  He'd invite you down.  He would invite everyone down to his restaurant.  You'd go there and, you know, you don't expect a free meal, but you expect a little something  something.  Expect something.  I don't care.  Give me a free dessert.  I want a free meal.  I want a free meal.  I took a glass of your club soda off the bill.  Oh, you did, did you?  No, he wouldn't do that even.  No, not even.  You're right.  Not even that.  If someone invites you to a restaurant, you know, all of a sudden a free appetizer shows 
[00:17:30]  up, like, oh, this is on the house, try it, or dessert, or an after-dinner drink, just  something to say, hey, thanks for coming to my restaurant.  They bring you the check.  Only one person's dinner is on it.  By the way, I officially have not invited any listeners to FH Riley's.  Because if you invite, that's when you have to do it.  If they just show up, you're just showing up.  Let's make that perfectly clear.  I have not invited anyone to FH Riley's in Huntington, that fine restaurant that my brother 
[00:18:00]  is running and owning and having a good time with.  I have been to places where they have refused to accept my money.  Refused.  I was having a drink at the Overlook Hotel.  My money was no good there.  No good.  That's right.  You go in, he gives it back to you.  All right, let's go to Frank.  Frank insists that Twitchell's is fake.  Frank.  Yeah.  Hi.  All right.  All right, thanks for the call. 
[00:18:30]  It was great.  He goes, yeah.  That's all he gets today.  And waits for something else.  Frenchy.  Yep.  You were bothering Anthony on the way to his car yesterday after the show.  No, that's not true.  That's a lie.  A lie.  Frenchy.  What?  What was I doing the entire walk to the garage?  Dialing on your cell phone.  Right.  And then what did I do once I dialed?  To open your mouth and say something, for fuck's sake. 
[00:19:00]  You know what it is?  I feel I shouldn't have to.  That's not me.  You know what's me?  Seeing somebody take a hint.  I had the phone to my ear.  So what, goddammit?  I was saying something, so you should have dialed your fucking phone.  What were you saying to Anthony?  Let's see if it was important.  I wasn't saying anything, really.  You just said you were saying something.  No, I was just saying, you know, what's going on, that's all. 
[00:19:30]  What's going on?  And I was, and in my head I'm going, I'm trying to figure out what's going on.  And I'm listening to the news.  I was, I was preoccupied, Frenchie.  Do you listen to the show?  Do you understand my walk from the studio to my truck involves me just being me without any outside interference?  Do you know Poe walks a good five feet in front of me during that procedure?  No, actually it was like right next to you. 
[00:20:00]  And if we chit chat, it is because I initiated it.  Poring.  I initiated it.  And then when we get to the garage, I say, see you tomorrow, Poe.  And that's it.  Man, Frenchie, if there was any doubt that we didn't make the right decision.  You're really helping us out today.  You fucking suck.  I didn't do anything wrong, for fuck's sake.  He's a potty mouth.  I don't want to hear it.  You didn't do anything wrong, what, yesterday?  Yes, what the fuck, man? 
[00:20:30]  You were trying to talk to Anthony and you realized like many, many other people have realized before you  that he doesn't like being social, especially after the radio program.  Not the walk.  Once I get into the garage, Jamaican Mike is there.  It's like a party for me.  The old UPS guy that used to deliver the packages, I'm a chatty Cathy down there, let me tell you.  But on the walk, very important, to leave me alone.  All right, no problem.  I won't say a fucking thing, that's for sure. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, now there's an attitude.  Oh, look at the attitude.  No, I have an attitude.  Hey, Frenchy, you're going to try to make a huge comeback on the Opie and Anthony show?  What do you got in mind?  Can you do it?  I just want to open the fucking window and jump out the fucking window.  All right, we'll be open to that.  We can broadcast that.  Hold on to a microphone.  I mean, come on, man.  What the fuck is going on there?  Oh, I see the hand.  Hey, Mike.  See Opie's hand, grab the mouse. 
[00:21:30]  I'd rather talk about free meals.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Last week, I was up in New York on business.  Stopped by FH Riley's.  Talked to your brother.  He wound up buying me my whole meal.  Yeah, my brother actually is the polar opposite of me.  He is beyond generous.  You're generous?  Yeah, he's got my whole meal for me.  I'm all right, but my brother is beyond generous.  It's ridiculous.  You're generous.  Can't be giving away the store there, Opie.  No, no.  Can't be giving away the store.  Well, I'm glad you had a good meal there at FH Riley's. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, it was actually excellent.  So thank you again.  Well, now everyone's calling about FH Riley's.  Justin from Long Island got a free O&A shirt at FH Riley's.  What I do is I bring a huge bin of O&A stuff to the bar area.  Oh, you're pilfering swag from the studio.  Well, as long as it gets into the fans' hands, who cares?  Yeah.  They have ketchup at FH Riley's?  Huh?  They have ketchup and stuff at FH Riley's, too.  You don't have ketchup for your...  You need condiments?  No, why would you bring ketchup when you give somebody eggs and potatoes? 
[00:22:30]  No, you just give it to them plain so they can fucking mush mouth it.  Oh, boy.  I'm sure FH Riley's other restaurants don't have ketchup for eggs.  That fucking red-faced ass.  Did you not get ketchup this morning?  I didn't.  Thinking you didn't.  Stinks, no jelly?  Why don't you go talk to him about it?  Where is he?  Do you want to bring him in here?  Probably in a microwave oven.  Do you see his fucking red face?  It was scary, actually.  I think he needs to be checked.  What happened?  He went to the opening day at Yankee Stadium.  You've got to see how red this kid's face is.  A little sunburn.  A little. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  It looks like third-degree burns on his face.  Who went?  I forget his name.  I don't know any of them.  Arms.  It's the guy with the small arms, and that's why he burned his face.  He couldn't get the suntan lotion.  He can only work the sunblock up to his shoulders.  Right.  He has to put it on his hand and flip it up, and then try to duck his face into it.  Flip, duck.  Well, get him in here.  You've got to see how red his face is.  That's not him.  No. 
[00:23:30]  Thanks.  That's Travis.  That's no good anymore.  Well, you're able to carry those ketchup packets all the way over?  That's right.  Here he is.  He's got his own theme music.  Jurassic Park music.  Fuck it, Eric.  Oh, who is that, Dan?  Okay.  Person thought I'd give credit to somebody.  You just don't give credit anymore.  All right.  Good job, Ben.  The producer, he's in there.  It's his job.  Now, it doesn't look as red in the studio. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it's pretty red, though.  One side of your face is redder than the other.  There's the sun coming up over the stadium on that side, the right side.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  So, how was it?  Great?  It was good.  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah, I was actually on my way up to school.  My friend called me up.  He's like, I got tickets.  I was like, oh, I guess I'm not going to school today.  Were you yapping about me on Ron and Fez the other day?  Was that you?  No.  No, sir.  I heard somebody talking about that I asked them to mail out some tax envelopes. 
[00:24:30]  No, I wasn't.  And it came up on Ron and Fez.  Okay.  You're all the same to me.  It's nothing personal.  It's actually probably my bad memory, more so than your people, you guys just really blending  into one useless.  But he's the one with the short arms.  How could he not forget?  Now I know, but as far as the name goes, Bobby.  He's the one who's talking.  He's the one.  See?  I have no clue.  Which one's Bobby?  Is he the one with the bass mouth?  He's the one who's playing with the bullhorn in the seat one day after the show. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  Which one?  Oh, okay.  Oh, that guy.  I forgot about him.  Good old Bobby.  Yeah.  Well, boy, you are just action-packed, loaded with dynamite material here today.  Well, Travis, thanks for the ketchups.  Just remember, never bring ketchups with eggs.  You don't want ketchup or anything.  Thanks.  That would just make it far too delicious.  Sorry about that, Jim.  Anything else you want to say, now that the entire country's asleep? 
[00:25:30]  Wow.  Must have been a late night, right?  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, there you go.  Late night, Opie.  He doesn't have the energy.  He's tired.  Well, what happened to the game?  Celebrating.  How was the ball game?  It was a good game.  Did you stay to the end?  Yeah, we did.  Yeah.  I almost feel like I'm there.  That was exciting.  You came up with the big home run.  And you went, oh my God, that was a home run.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  It is high.  It is far. 
[00:26:00]  It's gone.  Wow.  Are you looking for a career in broadcasting?  Oh, yeah, but I'm not doing it so good right now.  No, no, that's cool.  You want to work for Light FM?  That would work for you.  Even Light FM has some kind of delivery.  I know.  You're more like an NPR guy.  Yeah.  NPR is awful.  Where you just deliver the news in a monotone voice.  Yeah.  A little tired.  The world could be crumbling, but you wouldn't know it when you listen to NPR tell you that 
[00:26:30]  the world is crumbling around you as you drive to work with really high gas prices.  Higher than last summer at this time.  Price per barrel, close to $70 once again.  Global warming should kill us in the next five years.  More Ted in Iraq.  Researchers say. 
[00:27:00]  What kind of radio show do you want to do?  I'm not sure yet.  Okay.  We are.  None.  Yeah.  W-Z-Z-Z-Z.  You always like this?  No.  Are you nervous?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Just trying to hold it together.  Yeah.  Doesn't want to.  Actually, he probably doesn't want to say anything because it's worse. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  You know, you say something, you get a car crash, or you say something that sticks with  you for years and years and years.  One little line, and it could ruin you for years.  If you just shut up, then you're safe almost.  You get goofed on for being quiet, but, you know, for the most part, you're safe.  So where'd you sit at the ballpark?  About six rows off the end of the third base dugout.  Yeah.  Wow.  Paint quite a picture.  Thanks.  Any foul balls come close? 
[00:28:00]  Kind of close, but nothing.  Nothing.  Did you bring a little glove?  No.  Put on that stub?  No.  No glove.  Looks like shoulder pads anywhere.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the sun.  Maybe I should move.  I was watching the game.  I really wasn't worried about the sun.  We understand.  It's a beautiful bed, man.  For baseball, there's a happy young fan.  All right. 
[00:28:30]  If there's a fire, I'm not even going to run like in Mississippi burning.  I'm just going to stand here and explode like the cows do.  Why do they call them apartments if they're together?  Why do you drive on a parkway and park in a driveway?  It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to paint it.  7-Elevens are open 24 hours a day. 
[00:29:00]  Why are there locks on the doors?  I leaned my head out the window and smiled for a satellite photo.  I wish I remembered another Stephen Wright joke.  I'm grateful I can't.  Something about TVs, I think.  TV sets.  Why are they called sets when you only get one? 
[00:29:30]  When they get one.  This just in.  Another Stephen Wright joke.  From Than.  Remember that one?  No, why don't you do it in the Stephen Wright delivery?  Because that's what we're doing now.  I poured spot remover on my dog and now he's gone.  Anything?  I really have nothing. 
[00:30:00]  I suck.  Dana, why don't you tell us something?  What's going on in your brain right now?  I need to get some more sleep.  I thought you were going to push a button over there, Alfie.  I know.  You went to the opening day Yankee game yesterday.  It was an exciting finish.  It was.  It was.  And I'm really not feeling it.  I'm just a little tired.  Yeah.  At a late night.  Who isn't?  Look at my eyes, how red they are.  Were you trying to negotiate a hand job with a legitimate masseuse at 3 o'clock in the morning? 
[00:30:30]  No, I'm sorry.  Exactly.  Did he get it done, Jimmy?  Here's a big part of radio.  I'm going to tear down a closet.  All right.  That's good.  It's part of a wall.  Sure.  When I came in this morning, the first words out of my mouth when I sat down was,  Motherfucker.  I'm really tired.  Right.  Exhausted.  But when you get in here, you've got to be like, hey, unbelievable.  Had a great time last night. 
[00:31:00]  What did I do?  I don't know.  Maybe we'll talk about American Idol.  Watched a little of that, Opie.  It was fantastic.  You know, you've got to kind of, even though you're tired, you've got to kind of be up.  Right.  You know?  A little more enthusiasm.  Oh, wow.  That was it.  Well, we got enthusiasm.  He's right outside the studio.  Oh, my God.  His name is Twitchell.  Really having another bad day, too.  And his face is completely red.  It's like yours.  He's been smacking himself.  So, yeah, you've got to be a little op about the game. 
[00:31:30]  Like, the Yankee game was great last night, guys.  Oh, was it?  Where'd you sit?  Six rows off the third base dugout.  Must have seen a lot of good action over there, huh?  I did.  So, how was it in the stadium?  I mean, everybody thinking the Yankees, they're down, and then all of a sudden, Gita gets up  and, bam, smacks that out of it.  The stadium went nuts.  It was great.  You know, we were down when frickin' Bernie got picked off at second, that asshole.  All right.  Hey, look at that.  All right.  So, in the fourth inning, what was the ball-strikes ratio?  I have no idea.  The entire stadium went nuts except for one person. 
[00:32:00]  Yay.  Hey, could you come back a little later and do, like, Stephen Wright's act?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we get some Stephen Wright jokes for him?  Yeah.  You don't even have to change your voice.  Yeah, don't even have to.  Please don't have to.  That's Rye.  Right.  All right?  All right.  You know what Tom looks like?  Remember when you were a kid and you'd get those punching bags for Christmas?  And there's no arms?  The arms are stuck to the body, kind of.  Oh, that hurts. 
[00:32:30]  That'll leave a bruise.  Speaking of bruises.  All right, Tom.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  There you go.  That was terrific.  That was a good appearance, by the way.  Did we mention he's got the Armstrong thing on his arm?  Do I?  Did we ever mention that?  The Armstrong?  Yeah, the yellow rubber bandy.  Oh.  You might know someone that had cancer.  What can you say?  I don't know.  I want to see it, because I think it said, arm short.  Oh, Jesus.  No, it's a weight.  He puts little weights on his arms and stands there with them by his side. 
[00:33:00]  And hopes that they stretch out his arms a little bit.  All right.  We'll get the energy back into the show.  We're going to take a break.  Just wants to be like the other boys and girls.  Just wants to play patty cake.  We have Twitchell's outside the studio.  We want to see how he's doing today.  Are you still slapping your face?  He had a hard time.  A little bit?  All right.  He looks better today.  No, he doesn't.  He looks like he had a really, really rough night.  We'll talk to Twitchell's next. 
[00:33:30]  We've got lots of program to do.  Stay there.  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me,  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:34:00]  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony program.  We love the wow.  Get the wow stickers by going to opinanthony.com.  Got a wow on the vehicle.  All of a sudden, the girl sees it.  She knows what it's about.  She drives up next to you.  And out of nowhere, your boring commute home becomes a lovely breakfast.  We do celebrate wow on Wednesdays.  But it's happening all the time.  It's great when you're in traffic going to a sporting event or a concert or a concert or going to the beach or something. 
[00:34:30]  And wow is alive and well on Pal Talk.  Dude, don't talk about Pal Talk.  Lots of fine ladies on Pal Talk.  Made up a lot of the show.  Well, actually, most of the ladies are fine on Pal Talk.  Want to get Twitchels in here and see what he's all about today?  Sure.  All right.  And then afterwards, I want to sing the Peak Friends song.  Look forward to that. 
[00:35:00]  It'll be fun.  So what happened with the hand job last night?  Oh, it was just a massage that went awry.  I don't know.  What do you think you're coming over for at that hour?  Uh-oh.  She didn't know.  Awful little mousy Canadian.  No.  But it seems like you would be a pro by now.  Where you would know which ladies are going to give you the old...  Happy ending.  The old happy ending at 3 in the morning.  3 in the morning.  She comes to your house.  Uh, is she doing, like, the regular massage? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, kind of.  Where are you laying?  The bed?  Yeah.  All right.  So you're in your bedroom.  Naked.  Naked.  You're completely naked.  My stupid arms stretched out.  Just nude on my stomach.  Was she even trying to cover your ass up with anything?  Oh, no.  All right.  Her fingers brushed my balls a couple times.  Like as she was doing your inner thigh?  I fall.  And she had, uh...  She, she, uh...  So she, she knew what was going on.  And then how, how does it end where she goes, uh... 
[00:36:00]  No, I don't do that.  Do you see that when they start looking at the clock towards the end of the hour?  You're like, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  So you start aiming your penis at them?  Like, just grabbing it and kind of pointing it in the general direction that they're sitting  at?  Like an accusing finger?  Was she on your back?  Was she...  Were you on your back?  By that point, I was, yeah.  Yeah, when, when, when the minutes are ticking away, I'm sure Jimmy just flips right over.  You have no idea.  I'm fucking, I'm Frank Flip.  And, uh, of course, fully aroused.  No.  No?  For what?  She was doing nothing. 
[00:36:30]  Well, I, I would think to let her know.  No.  She...  Give her the old, hey, gotta take care of this issue.  No.  A little, little dumb Adrian fucking from Rocky Face.  Stupid Talia Shire mousy face.  She should be having a miscarriage in a fucking pet food store.  So she, uh, she, did she go near it?  Did she, like, brush, uh, that when you were on your back?  Yeah, she was just weird, man.  She brushed it.  And then what, what, what, how does it end?  What do you say to her? 
[00:37:00]  Like, you, I'm just gonna start stroking it and offering her more money.  Oh, you did?  Did I, yeah.  So, so you start stroking it and then you go, what do you need?  Like, 20 more bucks?  What, what's the line?  I don't know.  Sometimes you don't know what them.  Yeah?  No, I normally don't.  I'm like, look, I know the game.  You do.  Wow.  I've been here before.  That's scary right there.  Why?  That's scary to me.  If a girl's in there doing that and then you go, look, no, I know.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  This is after she was dressed and stuff.  Like, dressed when she's wearing her jacket and stuff on. 
[00:37:30]  She's like, I normally don't.  I'm like, look, I've done enough.  I understand.  You do.  So, once in a while you'll do it when you're in the mood.  I know.  Oh, wait a minute.  You weren't her type.  Um.  Well, neither, apparently.  You were insinuating.  Neither was Ben Franklin.  Oh, God.  So, you had to send her on away.  You paid her?  Wait, so was it awkward for an hour?  Because you.  This is towards the end.  You invited her over for a massage.  Was it a legit massage?  Like, she was, uh. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  It was mediocre.  Oh.  And then I wound up giving her extra.  She wound up doing it.  Oh, she did.  With her jacket on, standing there.  Oh, my God.  How funny.  It was awful.  What a horrid scene this is.  I'm on my back at the end of the bed, just jerking it and talking to her.  And I already paid her.  I mean, I'm not menacing.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  How much more did you have to pay for her to sit there and watch you jerk it?  And then she kind of helped while she had her jacket on. 
[00:38:30]  With her tits off.  You know, she took her tits off.  Her tits off.  Her tits off, yeah.  Oh, she did?  Out of her jacket?  No, she opened the jacket.  Oh, okay.  How much extra?  I don't know.  A hundred.  Oh, my God.  So, was there a negotiation that went back and forth?  Like, you know, I'll give you a look.  I'll give you 25.  She did this.  And she goes, no.  And then, what did you say then?  Like, what would it take to make you happy?  What would it take?  And she said, I said, she went like that.  I'm like, all right, there's a price. 
[00:39:00]  You're awful acting.  What was your next offer?  75.  75?  And she still went no?  She's like, what are you going to do to my tits?  What are you going to do?  Cut them off if you don't say yes, you idiot.  It's really annoying.  And then you had to say, all right, look, I'll give you a hundred.  That's it, yeah.  That's it.  And then how long did it take her to say yes?  Did she go again or just go?  She just kind of did it.  I would have wrought on it.  She reached over.  At that point, it wouldn't have mattered who was standing there. 
[00:39:30]  As long as there was a human hand on it.  Why?  You were just so worked up?  How could you not be?  You're jerking off with a strange Canadian looking at you.  How could you not be turned on?  I don't know.  That seems so awkward and out of place and she doesn't want to do this.  Was there small talk going on?  Light.  Like what?  What were you talking about?  Just like, what do you think at this hour?  What are you thinking?  I wasn't rude or vicious.  She could laugh and she knew it. 
[00:40:00]  I'm not very threatening.  She's like, well, I said legitimate.  I'm like, it's two in the morning you came.  And I'm naked.  You brush my balls.  She kind of laughed.  I'm like, I didn't mean to.  I'm like, yes, you did.  I didn't mean to.  You did mean to.  I know what the finger brushing the balls means.  That's the wink.  The wink of the massage girl.  So now, I assume.  This is a documentary waiting to happen.  This is a reality show waiting to happen. 
[00:40:30]  I was so annoyed.  Because your career is going so well.  And you're sitting there, two in the morning.  And this zero shows up.  A zero.  And she's not going to do what you expect her to do.  You know who?  She looked like Frenchie from Greece.  Oh, God.  Massage school dropout.  Fucking.  So now, I assume she finishes you off.  Yeah.  How long after that does she leave?  I was wiping them up. 
[00:41:00]  Handed her the bill.  And she fucking amscrated.  And I smirked at her.  She left.  Gotcha.  Oh, yeah.  You got her.  I did, though.  She actually was very happy to leave with no extra money.  Yeah.  She would have left with no extra money.  So it was a success for you?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Beat it.  Did she wash up?  Oh, yeah.  But you know what the thing is?  She sold me one car instead of selling me many cars in the future.  Ah, okay.  See?  See?  What a dope.  She's never getting a call back. 
[00:41:30]  Jimmy, you sound really tired today, too.  How could you not be up haggling?  It was like a fucking...  It was like a Turkish flea market.  But I don't understand.  Don't you have, like, regulars that'll come over and do what you want?  What fun is that?  Who wants sex?  Who wants sex?  No, I'm talking about when you...  You want a little game like this?  I'm talking about when you're going down the massage route.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You probably, but some of them...  You're just like, yeah, done with that.  Done with that.  You want to just move on?  It's fun.  Wow.  I was very frustrated.  But they couldn't do a documentary on which sign off on it. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, let's go to George in Chicago.  George!  Hey, I know what Jimmy said to the Canadian when he flipped over.  He pointed to his cock and said,  What are we going to do about this, eh?  Eh?  Eh?  Yeah.  Eh.  All right.  Let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, what's up?  $100 for a handjob?  Boy, you could get blown for $40.  In Germany.  I know.  I know.  In Germany.  I know.  Here's a rule of thumb.  Never negotiate with your cock out.  What was she, a Craigslist poor? 
[00:42:30]  They say never go food shopping hungry.  That's exactly what it is.  That's exactly what you did.  Yeah.  Was she a Craigslist?  I went, not only did I go food shopping hungry, but I went to the farm where they named the  prices.  You know, and he knew I wanted those eggs.  Yeah.  She knew, absolutely, you weren't going to let her leave without her doing what you wanted  her to do.  Did she know who you were?  No, I wouldn't have to tell her.  Hey, do you watch Comedy Central?  Struck it.  Jacket. 
[00:43:00]  Just, uh, just jacket.  Any of these ladies recognize you when they show up?  Yeah, I believe there's one I've called.  She goes, oh, you're the one with the pictures on the wall when I used to live in 43rd Street.  You don't want the funny pictures of you and famous people on the wall.  That's right.  That's me.  That's what you're known for.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in New York.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I want to ask Jimmy, what's the exact protocol to initiate the transaction?  Because I went, about a month ago, I went to a massage parlor, and it was on, you know,  it was the upper level of a storefront, so it probably wasn't a legit place. 
[00:43:30]  I get there, I start getting the massage, and then the girl flips me over, and she goes,  okay, what do you want?  And I said, you know, do everything.  And she goes, she looks at me, everything?  I said, yeah, do everything.  She goes, oh, no, that's illegal.  I felt like such a tool, and I had to slink my way out of the place.  Because you are a tool.  Whenever they say, no, that's illegal, that means that they want to know that you're not a cop.  Right.  I mean, I came in, I was, you know, I wasn't wearing anything that was, I wasn't wearing  plain clothes.  It was actually coming in scrubs and stuff. 
[00:44:00]  I remember one time, I went to this place in Los Angeles a long time ago, and the girl  the first night, fucking, I went to see her, and she was, I'm on my back on the table, and  my leg is propped up.  It was like a $70 massage, $60 massage, actually.  And she had, like, she has my right leg.  Picture yourself on your back, um, with your right leg bent and out to the right, and she's  holding it and kind of doing this weird pressure.  She didn't want to do anything.  I finally got her to jerk me off.  She was all right. 
[00:44:30]  Um, they all seem like, ugh, okay.  She did, but she was sexy.  She wouldn't let me touch her ass or anything.  I come back to see her again because she turned me on.  She's fucking massaging me.  She starts leaning down.  The next thing you know, right down on it.  Wow.  Un-fucking, but she just started blowing me.  How did that happen?  Who knows?  God's intervention.  It was so unexpected.  She was just blowing me.  Shit, a few drinks in her. 
[00:45:00]  Ah.  I think.  I wound up banging her.  Um, fucking standing behind the massage table.  Wow, look at you.  A long time.  After I came, she was just laying on the couch for a half hour, zoned out and drunk, playing  with herself.  She wanted me to go.  It was really bizarre.  Yes, you never know.  It's a far cry from, all right, don't touch my ass.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Theo in South Dakota.  Theo.  What's up, guys?  Hey, I just love listening to you guys.  Fucking got XM about three months ago. 
[00:45:30]  Got to tell you guys the shit.  Used to love Howard, but totally fucking hate that fucker now.  Um, but, uh, I just wanted to mention, because Jimmy was talking about that, obviously that  blow job, or that hand job for a hundred bucks.  I was in, uh, fucking Detroit.  Had some, uh, hoover come over.  Fucking, thought I was definitely gonna get something, pay 300 bills, only to have her  fucking sit on the bed naked with her fucking C-section scarf, give me a fucking blow, or  a hand job.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Horrible.  Fucking horrible.  All right.  That's all.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:46:00]  Appreciate it.  I'm out.  All right.  I had one, um, I forgot my story when he called shit.  I don't want my hand job.  All right, keep saying it.  Let's go to Ask F in Jersey.  Ask F.  Hey, uh, serious question for Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, how close did you ever come to actually pulling the trigger?  I've been listening to you for a while.  Oh, myself?  Yeah, on yourself.  Relatively close.  Or toe on the trigger, whatever.  Yeah, relatively close.  I mean, what's relatively close? 
[00:46:30]  Like, actually done, or pills, or?  I don't know, sir.  Just say, relatively close.  All right, well, I could get you dry tonight.  So you...  All right.  I was in LA, and I went for a massage, and she was legit.  And I knew she was legit, because she made you drape.  And, uh...  What?  They put draping over you.  Oh, okay.  Drape.  And when you walked into the bathroom, there was a sign.  Look at all these code words.  Drape.  Maybe drape.  Draping.  Like, yeah, certainly.  Yeah, draping. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  We all know about draping.  We never draping.  Sure.  When you walk in...  I walked into the bathroom, and there was a thing over the toilet that said, may you be  in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead?  And I'm like...  I looked at my dick and went, it's not going to happen, fella.  And, um, when I came out, I got undressed.  And, uh...  She's like, you have to get under the towel.  And I'm like...  I'm like, oh, you're really strict with that.  She goes, yes, absolutely.  Oh, you just know.  She was fucking...  Not fucking around. 
[00:47:30]  So she gave a good massage.  Yeah, then you just...  You probably just write it off like, okay, I'm going to enjoy a good massage.  Absolutely.  And a deep tissue massage.  The first massage I went for yesterday, around 6 p.m., was actually a very good, uh...  Regular massage?  Yes, it did not end...  How many massages did you get yesterday?  Yeah, two.  Two.  I'm fucking out of control.  I just want love.  I just got a second massage.  You just need a girl to be touching you and talking to you.  Wait, we were talking about hoarding yesterday, and you wanted to collect... 
[00:48:00]  You wanted to collect, uh, hugs and something else.  You wanted to collect a little, uh...  Yeah, I'll put it in a bottle.  What was it again?  I don't remember, but I know I'd like...  Come on, help me out.  I don't remember.  Was it tender moments?  Tender sentiments.  Oh, it's tender sentiments.  Tender sentiments.  Sounds like hugs.  You need some of those hugs you've been collecting.  It ended badly the first one, too.  It was a really bad day yesterday.  What?  What happened?  It's like fishing with Jimmy.  Ah, I didn't catch anything.  Ah, nothing.  Brought my bait.  Well, not for that reason.  Hackle.  No, I kind of figured this one was really, like, a strict masseuse, because the name 
[00:48:30]  of the company was...  It was, like, a company.  So, uh, I was supposed to be there at five, but I was happy...  We don't jerk you off, massage the company?  Exactly.  Do it...  Yeah, exactly.  Do-it-yourself, Inc.  It was, uh...  Maybe you shouldn't, uh, name the company.  For all the other guys out there.  Because it's a legit place.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Well, here's what happened.  I think it would be bad if the guys are calling up, like, there's a million guys calling  up, going, hey, I know the best place...  Like, this...  This dope.  Cisco in Jersey.  Cisco.  Yo, how you doing, Jimmy?  Hey.  Listen, if you want a real good massage, I know where the place is to go in Jersey. 
[00:49:00]  It's in Jersey, but they're fantastic.  Um, the girls are Brazilian.  Uh, they'll give you a good massage, and when you roll over, they'll do anything you  want.  Even Greek, if you want it.  Oh, cool.  I like a girl who speaks Greek.  Uh, they speak it and they do it, my man.  But it's fantastic.  If you want, uh, you know, I'll hold on, and I'll give you a few numbers that you can  go to, and, uh, they'll take care of you.  And just mention my name, you'll get in the door.  You don't have to worry about paying the desk.  Just mention my name, and you tip the girl. 
[00:49:30]  Okay, thanks.  Yeah, just hold, be on hold.  There you go.  They got to blow up their spot.  Bad rep for Greek, Scott.  Yeah, that's what they get.  Fucking, uh...  So anyway, six o'clock.  I am having blinds installed.  My, my, my shoulder shades came.  Oh, congrats.  Thank you.  And, um, I knew I was running late.  I had a five o'clock appointment.  So I called her, like, this late...  Not six, it was five.  So I called her, like, four or fifteen, like, I'm going to be late.  Because she knew I was doing that.  I just booked her, like, one in the afternoon.  I'm like, I'm having this stuff installed.  So I was late.  And I told her, I called her three times. 
[00:50:00]  Just because I'm very courteous, like that.  And I get there, and, um, I know she's legitimate, and I walk in.  Which is fine, I could care.  I just, I want...  Now, how do you know?  The, the atmosphere, the setting.  It's like an office.  You know what I mean?  You just kind of knew.  This is kind of good for the people out there, so they know, when they walk into a massage  place, uh, not to say, hey, could you stick a thumb up my ass and play with my balls?  Yeah, no, I wouldn't have done that there.  And I didn't really care about that at that point.  I actually wanted a massage.  I'm like, yeah, let me get a real...  Once in a while, you want a real massage to relax, like someone who... 
[00:50:30]  There's nothing better than when your spine is cracked and little knuckles on your...  It feels good.  Sure.  So, I walk in, and I get it, and I'm on my stomach, and she was like, well, do you want  to do an hour and a half since we started 25 minutes late?  And I'm like, nah, I would rather just do, um, the whole hour, because I had to work.  And, uh, I had to wear the towel the whole time.  You know, I was joking about how I hated the towel, but she was...  I knew it was not going off.  Yeah, it's not happening.  It was fine.  And it was a decent massage.  It's a joke.  I was joking about not liking the towel.  I was kidding! 
[00:51:00]  I was kidding!  I was kidding!  So, um, all of a sudden, this massage seemed a little short.  She stopped at 40 minutes, because that was technically the end of when the hour would  have started had I been on time.  Whoa, that ain't good.  And I'm like, but I called you.  I did on a credit card, too.  Like, you had to hold your point on a credit card.  Um, it's another sign that that's a legit place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, and she's like, well, you know, we have a policy.  I'm like, you're the proprietor.  It's your place. 
[00:51:30]  And that was really awkward.  And she's like, well, you know, I'm like, this is unprecedented.  Like, you would charge me when I called you.  You knew it was...  I'm outraged.  This is unprecedented.  It was like the McCarthy hearings.  You've never heard language like that.  Bye.  I am outraged.  You're out of order, whore.  I was so irritated.  And then she was like, well, I guess I'll just charge you for 45 minutes.  Um, and I knew she was afraid I was going to refuse the charges on the card.  I'm like, no, just keep the money. 
[00:52:00]  Keep it.  How much was it?  A hundred bucks.  Regular hour-long massage.  Um, which is even expensive, actually.  But, I mean, again, for someone that does, like, holistic, like, counseling and food,  they do all that, like, uh, health counseling.  Hippie shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, it's like, it's a legit business.  So, I was so irritated.  All I'm thinking of is just killing her on the air today.  I'm like, oh, your phone is going to ring.  Stupid.  I've never had that happen.  Yeah.  And I emailed her.  I've never emailed somebody how annoyed I was.  I'm like, you know, you're in the...  Why would you do that? 
[00:52:30]  Uh-huh.  And she was very apologetic.  Like, so I don't know if I'm going to give the name of the place out.  Maybe I will next week.  But that's why you had to get the other massage yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, no, I kind of knew that one wasn't going to be anything other than a massage.  Because something was missing.  Something was missing, right.  It was just a bad...  It was either that or write another post-it.  Do something.  Just another post-it.  Post-it guide from yesterday.  Yes, they referenced me again.  Write it.  Oh, we referenced you.  Gotta write it.  Post-it guide from yesterday.  That was my life.  That was terrific.  Wow, you've got a hell of a thing going on. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  It's called loneliness.  It takes up a lot of time.  It's all-consuming.  It's money and...  Is it ever fun, Jimmy?  Is it ever fun?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're making a lot of people sad.  Even when it's over.  I'm just tired.  When it's over.  I know.  I've got to tell you, I thought I was really tired today.  Because there's things going on and...  I'm just exhausted.  And so, I didn't get a good night's sleep.  And after hearing...  What was the guy's name?  Tom? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  The intern?  Yeah.  And then Jimmy has a mellow delivery today.  I feel like I'm wide awake.  Yeah, I'm just really sleepy.  Fundle of energy.  Let's say hi to Josh in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Tough guy from O-Town.  That's the theme of today's show, so bring it on, brother.  I was in North Carolina, and they have these places called adult relaxation places.  Yeah.  Whatever.  And a buddy of mine was like, hey, let's go in here and get a massage.  So, I went in there, and he goes in the other room, and I'm just like hanging, and 
[00:54:00]  all of a sudden, this lady comes out and says, okay, you're next.  I figured she was like the owner of the place.  She was like 80 years old.  I go in the back room, and she's the one giving me a massage, this like 80-year-old woman.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Josh.  Was she really 80?  Dude, she was very old.  And I'm talking about like a 60-year-old.  If she was 67, she would fucking rode hard and put away wet, I'll tell you what.  All right.  Anyways, I go ahead, and she starts giving me a massage or whatever, and she goes, so 
[00:54:30]  you want to turn over?  I'm like, oh, I'm like petrified.  Not because it's not what I planned on doing in the first place.  This lady was like, I mean, horrid.  I just had the visual in my head.  Dude, it was way worse than what she did, believe me.  So I want to hang around with it.  Can you imagine, though?  Do you want to turn over?  I'm thinking about that.  I'm thinking she's going to like shut a gummy or something. 
[00:55:00]  I'll say no.  Do I have a choice?  For me to get a good massage, a good like legit one, it's got to be with a woman who's  unattractive, like heavyset, not fat, but like a kind of like a, I got one in D.C.,  Brazilian lady who was kind of like butchy.  Really?  Yeah, she was in her 40s.  Because it was like a legit, it was a woman's hand.  I don't want a guy's hand.  And it was legitimate.  A little strong?  Well, no, no.  I just wasn't attracted to her.  This chick had like loose skin. 
[00:55:30]  It was like foul.  Wait, Josh, so finish up with you and then we got to get back to Jimmy.  That's cool.  So you turned over?  Yeah, I turned over.  I let her go at it.  Dude, I went to an old lady one time.  Her name in the, all you didn't say her name was in the paper, wasn't her real name, was  Miss Park.  And she did like some naughty, like English teacher.  Dude, she was awful.  This was years ago.  I show up at her place and she's probably 50 years old wearing glasses and she did some 
[00:56:00]  like disfocals.  Yeah, pretty much.  And it was the fucking worst.  I get my pants off and she was like trying to be dominating and sexy, but I just wanted  to kick her in the face.  Because she gave my bottom a swat and she goes, ooh.  Like she was like looking at my penis, which was, it looked like fucking, it looked like  it had just come out of ice water.  You've never seen a softer object.  And she looks at it, she goes, ooh, look at you, naughty boy. 
[00:56:30]  Aww.  I asked a swat with her 50 year old hand.  That was so, I guess the last I have a rod, is that your line?  And she said something about Ronald Reagan.  Really?  Yeah, we're talking about Reagan.  I don't remember, but it was so awful and I'm on my stomach.  Probably a date she had with him.  Jesus.  And she put baby oil on me, which is the worst massage stuff.  And she was, I think Jack could be a little and I actually stopped her.  I'm like, I can't do this.  I had to go see my girlfriend.  Just get out of here.  Was there any action going on? 
[00:57:00]  My dick.  Down below?  My dick was actually angry at me.  Right.  We were attempting to wake it up.  That is really funny.  Let's say hi to David in Florida.  David.  Jimmy, don't feel so bad, man.  At least you got something out of it.  I had the bitch walk out on me after five minutes.  She took my money.  Actually, first, it doesn't look good when she shows up in a brown leisure suit.  Wow.  Was she hot?  And then she just comes in, takes the money, gets on the phone and starts yabbling for 
[00:57:30]  five minutes, looking at my computer screen here because there was some porn on it.  And then she starts going out and she says, hey, I give the dude my money.  And I said, and I've been through it before, unfortunately.  And it's like, I got to go out, you know, I got to go out with you.  And I start walking out with her because I knew what she was trying to do.  And I get out there and she starts going, well, you have adult material on your computer  and we don't do that kind of thing.  Oh, boy.  And she took the money, right?  I looked at her and I went, you're ripping me off, right? 
[00:58:00]  And I just turned and walked away.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, yeah.  If I ever wanted to get on Whack Bag and put the name of this company up, I wanted to.  So freaking bad.  Go on to Pal Talk and do it.  Why not?  They would love to tease those people.  You absolutely should.  Go on Craigslist and post it.  If it's a run and grab, go to Craigslist and post it.  You know, after your stool thing, you know, with your stools, I was thinking we should have  some just top secret, way underground websites.  It's like that movie, that old movie where they took care of justice. 
[00:58:30]  Michael Douglas.  The Chamber?  The Chamber.  No, no.  Was it The Chamber?  Yeah, it was The Chamber.  No, The Star something.  Star Chamber.  Oh, Star Chamber.  Star Chamber.  I don't know if the movie holds up, but that was a terrific flick back in its day.  How Holbrook was a judge?  Back in its day, yeah.  And we should have these just...  Tell it to call you Billy.  We should have these way underground websites where we take care of these businesses that are just  doing our listeners wrong, man.  You have to, in a weird way, when it comes to massage, like this is where I wish Keith 
[00:59:00]  was not such a lazy shitbag and came in, because he's a complete filthbag and has massage  stories where he's actually almost had fights in place.  Keith Robinson?  He's a fucking maniac.  Keith Robinson, a guy that we know would do great radio for us, and for some reason we  just can't get him in here.  He loves...  He loves the...  He's just...  He's fucking lazy.  He's lazy.  Is he shiftless, too?  Well, yeah.  You know, comes with the...  Lazy.  Yeah.  Comes with the hairdo.  Well...  He has the best massage stories where he's...  One time he said this chick showed up, this really skinny, crack whore chick, and he 
[00:59:30]  wouldn't pay her, because he won't pay her.  He really won't pay.  And she's like, well, I'm going to go out and get my driver.  He's like, well, bitch, go get it.  And then the driver called up and goes, I'm going to have to come up there.  And Keith's like, well, that motherfucker, come up and get all money.  And the fucking guy, of course, didn't come up.  Keith is a psychopath.  He really is.  And the guy could sense that this is a major problem and she was ugly.  But whereas me, I would have been like, yeah, go ahead, because you don't want to  get maced.  And another friend of mine whose name I can't mention had a gun pulled. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, there were once in a while, you came on to a serious...  Once in a while, you got to say...  Gee, who would think?  Dealing with the underworld.  It's the cost of doing business.  It's like being involved in gambling.  There's times where you're just going to lose and it's like fucking...  It sucks and you know you shouldn't.  But...  What was the worst thing that happened to you with these massages?  Massages.  Massages.  Jesus.  One time, a hooker grabbed my key...  Oh, that's different.  As he grabbed my keys in my car, I threatened to throw them out the thing.  I had a hooker snatch my glasses off years ago.  Your glasses?  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:30]  Why?  You don't...  You used to wear really bad glasses.  Years ago.  You don't...  You don't want to know.  It was many years ago.  Why did she snatch them off?  Well, it was kind of a she.  But it was...  How old were you?  I'm 37, 38, 36, maybe.  I was probably early 20s, 22.  And I just discovered fucking...  The trannies hung out.  I really was new to me.  And I was fucking kind of fucking with them.  Like, I would never stop.  I would just kind of like stop. 
[01:01:00]  And I didn't realize that there's a wall you have.  Like, my window was always open.  I didn't think anyone would ever reach into the car.  And I would just kind of ride around and like ask them questions and drive away.  I was just the most annoying guy.  And it was fun.  And my buddy, comic buddy, showed me where they were.  And I stopped on time.  I'm at the stop sign.  And I fucking...  The one who I asked a bunch of questions to just walks over and snatches my glasses off my face.  And goes, for wasting my time.  And walks away with them.  And I'm fucking...  This is where I live with my parents.  I'm in...  You gotta drive home. 
[01:01:30]  Because I couldn't see.  I'm in fucking...  You idiot.  You idiot.  I'm at a stop sign.  There's cars beeping at me.  There's fucking prostitutes all over.  I can't see.  A hooker took my glasses and my shoes.  I couldn't see.  Literally, I can't see 30 feet in front of me.  And I'm like, oh my God.  And I saw a cop car.  So I fucking start high-beaming and beeping.  And the cop stops.  I swear to God, I get out of the car and go, she took my glasses.  She took my glasses. 
[01:02:00]  And the cop's like, who took your glasses?  So I...  And what are you doing here, you idiot?  Oh my God.  Of course.  And the cop...  Oh, you were just driving by and making fun with them, right?  Well, it was kind of the truth.  And he just knew I was an idiot from Jersey.  And he got my glasses back.  And he just goes, just go home.  Just get out of here.  Just go home.  If I see you here again, I'm gonna fuck you.  Snatch my glasses.  Another great visual.  Snatching the glasses.  For wasting my time.  For wasting my time. 
[01:02:30]  Let's go to Joe in Alabama.  Joe!  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just started using a cock ring here a couple of weeks ago.  And I'm getting nice wood off of it.  But I'm wondering how long can you leave the thing on before you do some damage to your mule?  I don't use them.  I would use one, if you wanted to use one once in a while, just to get like a real sick rod.  But I mean, it can't be healthy to force your body to do something like that.  No.  I mean, I don't know.  But how long do you leave it on for?  I don't know.  30 minutes or whatever. 
[01:03:00]  No, that's fine.  Yeah, it's fine.  You can probably leave it on for hours.  I don't know.  No, no.  I'm getting nice wood off of it.  It's all veiny and blue looking.  It's definitely a blue vein throbber.  No fresh blood getting in there.  Why can't you just get nice wood?  Well, I do, but it makes you feel better when you bust a nut.  Sometimes you think you're like a, you know, it's like soggy.  It's decent.  You know, you need a little extra boost.  It's like you're taking a needle.  Peridactyl thing.  We know you're in studio there, Twitchels. 
[01:03:30]  All right, Joe.  All right.  One more here.  Let's go to John.  When I got my glasses, it was like a face slap.  When she took my glasses, it was like I was slapped in the face.  That's what, I'm glad I got the LASIK, man.  Because you always felt like, oh my God, one stupid thing with your glasses and you're screwed.  Oh, I was there in New York.  I would have had an hour drive home.  I couldn't have done it.  I'd done it.  No?  No.  No contacts.  I think I had contacts at the time when they were out there.  What do you think happened in older days?  You just kind of were an invalid. 
[01:04:00]  Before they, you know, yeah.  Like this was a serious illness.  They came up with glasses pretty damn early.  Yeah.  They figured that one out.  That was like one of those things they had to figure out.  Yeah, but how early?  Like in the 1700s?  I don't know.  I think maybe early 17s.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The Romans didn't have them.  No.  But was it called blindness before that?  Yeah, it was probably just like, oh my God.  I've been stricken.  We must put leeches on his eyes. 
[01:04:30]  You know, they probably did all kinds of wacky things.  If thine eyes deceive thee, pluck them out.  Oh, okay.  They're deceiving me.  It's all blurry.  I got to pluck them out of my head.  All those wacky little rules and medicine they had back then.  If someone has the answer to that, that would be wonderful.  Soak his eyes in Brian.  Brian.  Right.  If he cannot see clearly, it is surely the devil in front of his eyes.  We must hit him with a cross about the head. 
[01:05:00]  And burn him for a while.  You must burn.  The pain will fix your eyes.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John.  Hey, how are you guys doing today?  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm going to tell you a story, man.  When I was a couple years back, I was a young guy.  I went to a Chinese massage parlor.  These guys, these ladies are the worst, okay?  I was getting massaged from this lady, and I could not come for some reason.  And she's like, hurry up, hurry up. 
[01:05:30]  You finish now.  Or you pay extra.  You pay extra.  There's nothing worse in the world than some woman rushing you to come.  Yeah, customer service in those places is never good.  Yeah, who do you complain to?  Do you know there was one sexy one I went to, though, one time.  It was a Chinese place.  And I don't go for the Chinese places, but I went for this one.  Well, you're on your stomach, right?  And here's how they beat out law enforcement or whatever.  She wears a short skirt.  And there's a mirror across the room.  So you're getting your massage.  And as you're looking towards the mirror, you can see her bending. 
[01:06:00]  She's bending towards you.  And you can look right up her skirt and see her ass in the mirror.  So it's so fucking sexy.  And then you know where you stand.  That's right.  And if she didn't have awful breath, I would have enjoyed it more.  What rotten, rotten breath she had.  Well, Bob Kelly had a funny line.  He goes, they always have bad breath.  It's because they live in a place.  They're actually, what do they say?  They're eating fish off a, what are those little room things that you cook something on?  A hot plate?  Yeah.  They're eating fish off a hot plate. 
[01:06:30]  That's exactly what it's smelling.  The calls continue to come in.  Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, we're just kind of hanging, I guess, today.  About two years ago, me and my brother decided we were going to share a hooker.  So she comes out to the house.  And I decide I'm going to go first.  And I'm hitting her doggy style.  And her head got, like, two feet within a candle.  And her head lit on fire from the hairspray in her hair.  And I had to stop, drop, and roll her and throw a blanket over her head. 
[01:07:00]  Nice.  Good shit.  Did you have to pay extra for that?  No, actually.  Yeah.  But it was quite scary.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Megan in Houston.  Megan.  Megan.  Hello.  If you're from Houston, say hi.  Huh.  Nothing.  All right.  I guess we'll stop here.  Twitchell's in studio.  We'll talk to him next. 
[01:07:30]  Good job, Bob.  What's going on, man?  It's been crazy.  How are you doing after yesterday?  Oh, the slapping kind of died off around four.  Came back around six.  You had fun in the elevator, huh?  Oh, my God.  It was nuts.  It was this guy in a suit.  And, you know, as soon as he started twitching, he had that.  And as soon as he saw me twitching, he had that immediate, I'm better than you look on  his face.  Ben could testify to that.  It felt so awkward.  But I deal with it all the time.  And I'm better than you look?  Yeah.  It immediately thought. 
[01:08:00]  I think he thought I was fooling around, you know, because I was at that point, I was  really slapping myself repetitively, constantly.  And it was just so awkward.  Because I like to wait to leave the studio sometimes when I'm really riled up to calm  down.  But Ben insisted that I get in the elevator and go for a ride.  Maybe that will calm me down.  Ben was taking him all the way up to the roof and then back down.  You don't honestly think Ben was being a nice guy yesterday.  No, no.  I know he wanted to see the reaction.  Of course.  Because Ben is a sick fuck just like the rest of us.  But, yeah.  It was only that long time. 
[01:08:30]  He just does it in different ways.  He does it for the enjoyment of two or three people.  Personal, yeah.  And then he'll call all his Boston friends and tell them what he did.  But he'll give him a piece of the story.  Yeah, he switched on the elevator.  Yeah, Johnny James.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boston.  Boston.  Five in a row.  Cheryl.  Cheryl.  He just walks in and says a name. 
[01:09:00]  Steve.  What?  What about Steve?  No, no, no.  I was saying.  Steve.  But I just went along with it.  Just this goddamn thing.  Were you slapping your face?  Yeah.  And then I actually stood out front and had about four cigarettes before I left.  I was out front for about, damn it, for about 20 minutes before it really calmed in.  Why the slapping of the face?  See, it's like, you know. 
[01:09:30]  Feels good.  A tick usually has a purpose.  Like, it makes it feel better once it's done.  You know, if I...  For that split second?  Yeah.  But then again, it just comes right back.  And, you know, a lot of, like me, it feels better when I touch something.  Like, when I touch the face, when I make contact, that's when it makes me feel good.  Yeah.  Although it's, you know, after I do it so long and riled up, it starts to hurt.  But I just can't stop it until it stops.  Why don't you just stop for a second and don't give in to it?  It's very difficult. 
[01:10:00]  I know that.  But you can.  We're going to cure you today.  We're going to get jelly on your hands.  Like, when I'm acting and doing comedy, it's not a problem.  But I can't always be in that mode.  I understand.  I've had little tics in my life.  I used to spin once to the right.  I used to hop and by the middle of my right foot had to touch the sidewalk correct.  So I understand.  Isn't that an OCD thing, though?  No, it's part of Tourette's, too.  Like, the tap of the right finger where the middle...  When you take your middle finger, there's the nail.  I would just tap the nail like this.  On a hard surface.  Something's wrong.  Something's wrong.  No, it's not. 
[01:10:30]  All right, listen.  Don't get him going yet because we're going to try to cure you today.  Just stop for a second.  You can just stop for a second.  I mean, if the doctors...  Guys, go get stuff.  Go get stuff for his hands and start bringing it in.  What do you mean?  We're going to put stuff on your hands.  We're going to cure your stupid slapping thing today.  You think that's going to help?  Absolutely.  See, if you stop when you act, it's because if you have moments, like, just don't give in to it.  I know it's hard.  It feels like it's incomplete and it's wrong.  And God, it will feel good when you do it. 
[01:11:00]  But it doesn't feel good.  We got some ketchup.  Here, give me the ketchup.  Jimmy.  What?  We're going to cure you today.  When you slap yourself in the face, are you going, oh, my God, my hand is coming up to my face.  Oh, my God, it's hitting me.  I get a split-second warning, like I know it's going to happen.  No, no.  Or do you know you're slapping yourself in the face?  Like I said, I get, like, a split-second warning, so I know it's going to happen.  I know I'm going to slap myself.  But, you know, I just can't control it to stop.  Is it a conscious thing where you go, I have to smack myself. 
[01:11:30]  I can't hold it any longer.  If I really try to hold it, it just builds up.  So, I mean, there's sometimes where I do it and I don't even notice sometimes.  Like, I notice once I hit it.  But, like, in conversation, living with Tourette's my whole life, it becomes, like, a part of me.  But when I try to hold it and try to, you know, that's when I'm aware that I'm actually really, really trying.  And when people talk about it, the more you feel it.  Oh, of course.  Every time I come here, you know, I know something's going to happen.  I just accept that.  You can stop just for a couple seconds.  I try.  All right, what else do we got? 
[01:12:00]  We got ketchup.  We got jelly.  Jelly.  It's going to be all sticky.  Jelly.  What else we got?  Have we got anything else in the fridge?  Acid.  Whipped cream.  Whipped cream.  Jump.  We got the Icy Hot.  What else?  Jump.  It really needs, we really need something to put this over the top.  Honey.  We got honey.  How about a log?  How about a log from Tippy Tom?  One log in each hand.  Or a pair of underwear from Tippy Tom in each hand. 
[01:12:30]  Swinging that around.  Dude, a pair of intern underwear.  I bet you, Tom, I bet you, Tom wishes he had this affliction.  You know, he's always slapping his Adam's apple.  All right, when we get back, we're going to put some ketchup and jelly on your hands.  We're going to cure you.  We are going to cure you.  You're going to be fine.  You're going to be fine, okay?  Why don't you show at the Laugh Factory, by the way?  Quick plug for you, too, because you're coming in.  It's actually going to be tomorrow night, 9 o'clock, the Laugh Factory. 
[01:13:00]  Cool.  Short bus tour, we're all going.  Short bus comedy tour.  All of us, man.  Are you going to just be slapping the crap out of your face in front of everybody?  Well, that's the thing.  Like I said, you know, I get in my mode, and then I can concentrate, and it doesn't affect.  But ever since I've been on this show, I don't think I've had one comedy show where I haven't had at least five or ten ONA fans in the crowd yelling jump when I first go on stage.  Right.  And, you know, it dies down, and they let me do my act, but, you know, after I'm done, that's when it starts to build up.  They start to come in and see you, right?  Oh, you guys so much. 
[01:13:30]  I've actually had a lot of sold-out crowds since I've been on the show.  You know, 150 rooms, not big rooms, but it's doing me well.  And you got this latest tick from going to a conference.  Stay away from the conferences.  Yeah, exactly.  Just jump and do what you got to do.  I mean, there's no reason to fucking just jump around here with your friends.  There's no reason to slap your face.  You don't need to know what the latest Tourette's thing is.  Exactly.  It looks ridiculous.  It looks ridiculous.  And you're going to bring it home with you.  Did I tell you about the one kid who had this tick?  He would, you know, do both his arms back and forth with the middle finger all the time.  He's doing the middle finger like he's boxing.  It's almost a shadow boxing.  Yeah, exactly.  Left, right, left, right, with the middle finger. 
[01:14:00]  But it does kind of feel good.  Exactly, but then he would touch his face afterwards, and it all relates to the touching, you know?  He's an ass.  What do you have to say to the people that say that you're fake?  You know, I've lived this my whole life.  I was diagnosed when I was seven, but technically I was born with it.  It's a part of me.  So, you know, when people say that, it doesn't phase me anymore because I know it's real,  and that's all that counts, and I wish I didn't have it.  I know it's real.  I have no doubt in my mind.  I don't know.  I'll jump.  It's my business.  You know, if we tied you to that chair and then said jump, what would happen? 
[01:14:30]  Well, every time you say it now, I mean, my feet are raising when you do it.  But, you know, when it gets really bad, that's when my whole body starts to do it.  But what if we tied your arms and your legs to the chair and then said jump, what would  happen?  Well, I would still try, probably.  All right, go get some duct tape.  We'll cure the Tourette's day.  Try that one.  It feels good.  Hey, man, if I was curing people on TV, we should be curing people on the radio.  My friends always try some nit-tick ideas all the time. 
[01:15:00]  If you try it, it feels right.  It just fills the throat.  I don't even know if I can do that.  Oh, yes, you can.  Are the guys bringing in other stuff to put on Twitchell's hands?  So far, we've only got ketchup and jelly.  All right, we're going to go to break.  We're going to continue with Twitchell's.  He's really...  You know, when Jimmy was telling his stories, he was okay.  When we first started talking to him, he starts building up a little bit, and now he's  just going to be out of control.  That's the thing.  When I listen to your conversation, and you guys are hysterical, and I'm enjoying something  like watching TV, a movie, I'm focused. 
[01:15:30]  That's, you know, they have subtle tics, but they're less calm.  Yeah.  When the focus is on me, and it starts talking about it.  Yeah, but I'm still right now trying to control it to a degree.  Good luck.  Before we go off, did I think of the time when I was living at home with my parents for  years?  I lived with my parents in North Bungie, and I had a hooker come in and spark up a cry.  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Jump!  Okay, that's my whole story.  I thought that was going to be a good story.  It was a good one, but I just wanted to tell you how Jimmy gave us some great stories.  All having sex with the hooker.  Exactly.  That's how I pictured it, ending. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, it was hot.  Mom's degrading her.  Like in Sudden Impact, my mom's holding her down, encouraging me and dad to bang her.  Don't slap that hard.  Slap hard, dad.  No, no, no.  We'll get him going after the break, because we're going to cure him.  If you're going to be slapping, we're throwing jelly and all sorts of stuff on your hands  today.  Well, I'm going to try to...  I'm really trying to...  I might want to change it to a schmock.  Eh, eh, eh.  A schmock.  A schmock?  A schmock. 
[01:16:30]  Get a schmock.  A schmock.  See, this just came back.  I used to have this when I was a kid.  It just recently came back.  I was thinking about getting gloves that have some type of padding on it when it really gets  bad to help out.  I say you get a glove with nails.  Exactly.  It's compact.  Thanks for the support.  Oh.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Twitchels is in studio.  We're going to try to cure him of his Tourette's.  Opening down.  What the fuck?  What was that?  Looks like someone's getting the fucking pink slip.  Nope. 
[01:17:00]  The hell was that?  What was that, Hawk?  It went off on its own.  No, it didn't.  Of course it did.  It went off on its own.  Famous last fucking words.  Of course it did.  Yo, the shotgun went off on its own.  Of course it did.  Because I was beginning to set up the fact that we're going to play Earl Weaver and it  starts playing.  Just started playing on its own.  The computer at that point decided, whoa, I got to start playing this.  Pointed my mouse at it and clicked and it just went off on its own.  It's a devil machine.  In honor of opening day, you know, Earl Weaver.  Yeah.  Doing some kind of post-game interview and just decided to, I don't know, lose his mind. 
[01:17:30]  Literally, he thought he was on satellite.  No, no.  Here we go.  Check this out.  Now, some manager's corners with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winning  its manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best, your area Oldsmobile dealers, Anderson  Olds, Schaefer & Storminger Olds, Lee Oldsmobile, Metro Olds, City Olds, and Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver. 
[01:18:00]  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merrill, wants to  know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to  steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark and you  can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl. 
[01:18:30]  Jerry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break  one open in the fucking night.  So if this cocksucker didn't mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team,  we'd be a lot better off. 
[01:19:00]  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lady's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out of the fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn  streets, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner. 
[01:19:30]  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  fucking Network.  I will do you with Mount Wednesday.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[01:20:00]  Whitchell's back in the studio.  Why'd they put a bag on you?  They said they wanted to protect clothes or something so they didn't get messy.  Oh, Jesus.  Who did?  What's the fun of this?  I know.  I said I don't care either way.  Whose idea was the bag?  I mean, rip the bag off.  Get the bag off.  That was Poe's idea?  Whose idea was it?  Come on.  What?  Whose idea was it?  Who?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  Poe just started putting it on me.  I don't know who the idea was.  I'll take it off.  It was Poe's idea.  Are you giving him a haircut, Poe?  Nothing says fun like safe radio.  Like keeping his shirt clean.  Exactly.  It's an Opie and Anthony shirt.  Get a mask, too, because we wouldn't want to get on his face.  Give him the big puffy-like mittens.  Why would we play it safe ever?  Got it.  You know what I mean? 
[01:21:00]  Actually, if you could choke him with it.  Not only is he going to leave this studio.  Oh, my God.  He's going to try to cut the duct tape from around his neck, which is probably more dangerous than anything.  You're choking him.  Not only is he going to leave this studio a mess, we're not giving him a towel to clean up.  Oh, come on.  No.  No.  We are curing your Tourette's today.  It's the only way to do it, sir.  Hide all paper towels. 
[01:21:30]  Take those towels off the counter, Jimmy.  What towels are up?  I don't see any towels.  There you go.  No towels in the building.  We're going to see how real this Tourette's is.  How about this?  We'll throw some stuff on his hands.  Like scissors.  Actually, I want to get, like, one of those clubs that they club baby seals with.  Just have it taped in his hand.  He'll smack himself with a wooden club.  With a nail in it.  Well, we were going through a few things. 
[01:22:00]  Slap.  Well, they went to Dwayne Reed, so.  Oh, that's full of sticky nasty stuff.  To get milk.  So I think what we'll do is we'll see.  I fall back.  We'll see how real this Tourette's is.  We'll throw stuff on your hands.  We'll see if you can control yourself.  If you can't control yourself after you look like a complete asshole, we're going to parade  you around the streets of Manhattan.  That's why I come here.  With a camera crew.  Am I going to miss all this?  No, we're going to do it right now.  Okay.  I'm going to get a 10.  Rubber gloves, right?  You put surgical gloves on them that we have up there.  Okay.  That way he doesn't have to worry about what gets on his hands and then put pubes in his 
[01:22:30]  hand.  Do you think he'd smack his face with a guy's pubes?  The bottom line is I can't control it, so whatever you put on my hand is probably going  to end up on my face.  I don't see a house.  Because that's really bad.  All right.  Someone go cut their pubes out.  Snip some pubes.  Oh, please.  Snip some.  No, no, no.  We want to see how real this Tourette's is.  Because I'm sick of these people questioning it.  This should be something sticky first.  That's what I mean. 
[01:23:00]  Glue.  Glue first.  Glue.  No gloves yet.  No gloves yet.  Well, no gloves yet.  No gloves yet.  We'll start with strawberry jam.  Oh.  I like strawberry.  It's flavorful.  And then...  Do you like strawberries?  Strawberries.  I do like strawberries.  I really do.  And then have the guys clip some pubes and throw it on a piece of paper.  That's right.  There's got to be a health code against that.  Yeah, probably.  Sure there is.  That's right.  Doubt it for a second.  Oh, you know what?  Yes?  Unfortunately, John is right.  John? 
[01:23:30]  Yes?  Go ahead.  Hey, R.P.?  Yeah.  Before you went to break with this whole thing with Twitchells, you were the one who suggested  to put the smock on them.  Really?  Yeah.  You said put a smock on right.  I think it was more of a joke, though, to be honest with you.  Well, now we can't blame Poe.  Well, that's why I said I didn't know who said do it.  I just knew that he ended up doing it.  No, John's right.  I did say that.  I didn't really mean it, to be completely honest with you.  You know what I like?  I just knew it was going to get messy, so that was kind of, I was joking, like, we better  get a smock.  You know what I like?  You're right, though, John. 
[01:24:00]  You're right.  The fact that Poe didn't say, well, Opie said.  That's true.  He took his pinch like a man.  He took his pinch like a man.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  It's like he could be in the mob in Italy.  He certainly could.  Yeah.  Oh, ho.  That's what we forgot to talk about after the break, really fast, as the stuff from Dwayne  Reed arrive in studio.  Some of that stuff looks delicious.  It does.  I want a handy pack.  Seafood salad.  Oh, no.  And mayo.  From Dwayne Reed.  Mayo, by the way.  Cake icing.  Vanilla cake icing. 
[01:24:30]  Eggs?  Eggs?  Yeah.  Eggs.  I would eat that by the spoonful.  See, there's any meat, too, but I'd get fat.  That goes right to my thighs.  By the way, this is why Paltalk is so great, because this will be on Paltalk.  Don't talk about Paltalk stuff.  I ain't here about Paltalk.  Paltalk, you know.  Let me go again.  They're talking about Paltalk.  We ain't here about Paltalk.  Paltalk, Paltalk.  This one I read.  Yeah, I told you they talk about Paltalk too much.  Paltalk, Paltalk.  This one I read about Paltalk yesterday on Whackbag.  I love how we play into those psychos.  Who is that guy?  I told you.  I told you. 
[01:25:00]  See?  See?  I told you.  You guys were making fun of me, but look.  You heard it yourself today.  Some guy yesterday said, because we said, for those of you that have Paltalk, take a look.  And then we described absolutely exactly what was happening for the people that didn't.  I forgot exactly what it was, but something that was on Paltalk yesterday.  And some guy posted on Whackbag, it just shows that this is all they do, and that Paltalk is 
[01:25:30]  a huge part of the show.  Huge part.  Like, we talk about it all the time.  See, we understand we're doing radio, so we still describe the scene as best as we can.  See, it's our job to paint the picture.  We would do it anyway without the camera.  We continue to try to paint the picture, but this enhances the Opie and Anthony listening  experience.  For the people that are on board on Paltalk, they can see it.  For the people who feel like getting Paltalk.  And for the people that aren't, you would hear what we would normally be doing if there  wasn't a camera to be found in the studio. 
[01:26:00]  That's right.  You jackass.  So, really fast, because it is a big story.  They got a big mafia boss in Italy.  Yeah.  That they used to call what?  The Tractor?  They call this guy, he's 73, the Tractor, because he mowed down everything in his path.  Do you know what a bad motherfucker you have to be?  The Sicilian Mafia, to be afraid of you?  To call you the Tractor?  And they said he's been on the run for 43 years.  In Corleone, actually, in Sicily.  Corleone.  Corleone. 
[01:26:30]  And they got him, his name is Bernardo.  Don Vito.  Vito.  Vito Corleone.  And his wife, he got the wife's name wrong.  Got them all wrong until he got in the back room.  And then smeared it in his face.  And they got this guy, and the cops in Italy have to wear, like, those ski masks.  Yeah.  They're so afraid of the mob there.  Oh, if they got ID, they're dead.  Dead.  These guys killed judges.  The mob is rough in Italy, man.  In Italy. 
[01:27:00]  They've really, I watched a great special on the mob last night.  And they've really dismantled it.  I mean, it's still, you know, going on and a little smaller factions.  But the days of the big bosses that used to walk around and almost like celebrities,  especially Gotti, of course, everyone knew him, but would walk around.  You know he's an organized crime figure.  There was nothing they could do about it.  And they walked around like celebrities.  By the way, this is Anthony talking.  I completely believe that the mafia is as strong as ever. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, I'm not saying it's not strong.  I never.  I don't see any weakness whatsoever as far as the mob goes.  Did I ever say weak?  First of all, did I ever say weak?  I said they're still out there and around, but that day of the big boss is gone.  Well, they went back underground.  And I say that with sorrow.  I enjoy opening the paper and reading about these fellas.  There you go.  These good fellas.  They have been weakened.  I mean, because of Rico. 
[01:28:00]  And there's bosses, like high up guys that have, like, turned, stayed out into Rico, man.  That's just, they're never going to be the same again because of the Rico stuff.  But they arrested this guy and all the cops had hoods on their...  50 cops with hoods because they traced his laundry like his wife was doing his laundry.  There's some weird system they had, which obviously worked.  Got him on his laundry.  I think he was probably a little overconfident.  Like, you're free for 43 years.  Yeah, you pretty much figure you're done.  You start letting your guard down, like, who could possibly still be chasing me?  See those shows on some of the channels, A&E and stuff, the crime shows where the guys, cold case files. 
[01:28:30]  And he was 23 years later, he thought he was off the hook.  And then DNA, they find something.  And think back, like, 23, 25 years from right now and think of something like you did.  First space shuttle mission, 25 years ago today.  Was that it?  25 years ago today.  Really?  It landed, I believe, yeah.  Well, think about that.  You know, a long time ago. 
[01:29:00]  Think about all that has happened since that day.  In 25 years.  If you were just walking around, you know, think of something you did 25 years ago.  And then someone coming up and going, ah, remember that thing you did?  Ah, you're going to go to prison now for life for it.  Oh, but I was walking around.  Everything was cool.  I didn't do anything else.  25 years ago, I remember being 10 and invited to your 40th birthday party.  Jesus Christ.  That never happened.  All right.  You ready, Twitchels? 
[01:29:30]  We got some boys that are going to help with this or what?  I hope he's using Howie math on his birthday cake.  With his candles.  See, I can't.  Are we doing pubes?  I can't, though, because look.  All right.  You got nothing?  We need to see the pubes.  Okay.  I ain't going to pull out the thatch.  Start with the honey.  Start with the honey.  Jimmy?  Oh, the honey.  Oh, Anthony, stop.  I should have just said start with the sweetie.  Oh, God.  Out.  All right.  Now, how are we going to do the eggs?  Oh, geez.  Look, Steve's coming to barge in here and take it. 
[01:30:00]  Keep him away from the honey.  Everything is fun, but there's no need to waste it.  He's just trying to paw away at the honey.  Stop it.  So you're going to get all of his hands, Eric.  All right, now, take that honey now and rub it into the other hand like you would if  it was hand lotion.  Oh, this is freaking me out.  It's so sticky.  You don't like sticky things, Eric?  I hate sticky things on it.  Rub it like it's hand lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its hand.  Because we don't want it dripping all over the counter.  The honey on its paws.  The poor interns are going to have to clean all this up.  Now, you'll be fine.  Don't do it. 
[01:30:30]  You're not going to.  You can't have that sticky stuff on your face, man.  There's no way you're going to slap your face now if you have sticky stuff on your hands.  I'm really going to focus here.  I have to draw the line at a salmon.  It does feel kind of cool.  Wow, man.  The pal talkers are loving this because he's struggling.  When you bend your hands now, is it sticky in all the creases?  Yeah, yeah.  In the little crevices.  And you know when you unravel them?  They get that little stick.  Oh, yeah.  Describe the stickiness to Anthony.  We've got all sorts of things happening here. 
[01:31:00]  Describe the stickiness to Anthony.  No, really.  It really is.  Like, all in the little tiny crevices I never thought, you know, could be that bad.  When I used to work for a living, sometimes I'd be cutting holes for duct work in the floors,  and I'd grab onto a 2x4 in a newly built house, and it would have sap coming out,  and sap would get right in the middle joint of my thumb.  Yeah.  And you cannot wash that stuff, especially on the job site.  There's nothing that gets rid of the sticky.  Yeah.  And every time you bend your thumb, it's just... 
[01:31:30]  And it would make me lose my mind.  And how about behind the knees?  Oh, when I was a kid, I was on a little, like a chaise lounge.  And someone spilled Coca-Cola on there, and I laid down on the little chaise lounge,  and I got sticky Coca-Cola behind my kneecap.  And every time I bent my knee, and it drove me nutty.  Anthony, I would love to listen to you, but he is losing his mind.  Oh, and I feel so good to just smack yourself. 
[01:32:00]  Shit!  You have to.  You have to.  I don't have to.  It looks like he has two hands that are completely crippled,  because every muscle in his hands are working right now.  A smack.  I feel that urge.  That urge is there.  Jimmy's really good at this.  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  I know what this feeling is.  Oh, my God, look.  Oh, he almost hit himself.  Oh, look at his strain.  Oh, he wants to smack himself so badly.  It feels so good.  It feels so good.  Look, look.  He's wanting to cry.  Look.  Oh, yes, everything's right with the world. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Because it's puffed.  It's nice and a puppy.  And then if you hit it.  You guys always instigate me, and I have a good time,  but I really think I can do this.  It's just going to take time.  Yeah, just control it.  Just control it.  How sticky are his hands there, Jimmy?  It's just have to be awful.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, God, no.  It's a little sticky.  He's getting sticky stuff.  I saw honey fly.  Take the headphones off.  He doesn't need the headphones on. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, you really don't need it.  I saw honey just fly off his hands.  All right, look, look.  You're okay.  You're okay.  It's a little sticky stuff.  Does your face feel sticky?  All right, look, look.  Tastes nice.  Tastes good.  Good day.  And the thing is, now when I hit it and when I bring it out,  I feel like my skin pulling towards my hand.  Sticky.  Would you do that?  Never.  Never.  You can't get me near sticky stuff.  A lot of people are suggesting to put a dildo in one of his hands. 
[01:33:30]  We have a dildo?  He's not going to smack himself with a dildo.  All right.  Don't slap so hard.  He's got it.  It feels right.  He understands what he's doing.  It feels right for him.  It's right.  He knows the right hardness to hit.  I can't wait to get to that show tomorrow night.  That's going to be a great show.  Yeah, where's the show, Twitchels?  Focus on the show.  Oh, wow.  The Twitchels show.  Tomorrow night, 9 o'clock at the Laugh Factory.  Short bus comedy tour, right, Jimmy?  Yep.  There's a Laugh Factory on Broadway.  You're on 42nd Street.  You're working on 42nd Street.  Absolutely.  Legendary place. 
[01:34:00]  9 o'clock, you're going to be there.  The whole gang is going to be there.  Awesome.  Colin Quinn's coming down.  It's going to be a huge show.  What is this?  You know, you might stick it in his eyes.  You can't give him a fucking hard eye.  Yeah, I'm nervous about this.  Oh, my God.  He's shaking.  It just flew across.  Exactly.  The power of Christ's compulsion.  He's not going to hit himself with things.  He smacks himself.  Pudding.  Pudding.  Pudding.  Yeah, pudding.  Pudding.  Come on.  Put him some chocolate pudding in his hand.  E-Rock pudding. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  No, he doesn't even.  He doesn't even.  Uh-huh.  Where are the pubes and whose are they?  They're coming.  I'm sure Travis is involved.  They're coming.  I'm going to cut everybody's eyes out.  Travis.  Oh, my God.  It's only your hands.  The scariest waif ever.  All right, look.  He's got a really big can of pudding that is there.  Oh, God damn, no.  All right, look.  Look out, Danny.  Oh, it's Danny's fumes.  A big cup of beer.  Get away from me.  Get the fuck away from me.  We are getting video clips for the web. 
[01:35:00]  I'm starting a stammer worse than usual.  All right, he's got a handful of pudding.  Oh, God, that is a lot of pudding.  Oh, my God.  There's no way.  There's no way.  Look, you've got to control this Twitchels.  Control it.  Control it.  It doesn't feel good to slap your face.  You know that.  Oh, nice slap.  It doesn't feel good to slap your face.  It's sticky.  It hurts.  It's annoying.  But it's an urge.  It's an urge.  Patrice, come on in here.  Irresistible.  Patrice O'Neal.  It just feels right.  It just feels right.  Oh, shit. 
[01:35:30]  Look out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think it got Patrice on his hat.  I think it got on Patrice's hat.  Get that side of his face on video.  The whole right side of his face is brown.  You know how important Patrice's shit is to him? 
[01:36:00]  It got right on his yellow hat.  The whole side of his face is brown.  Patrice's going to throw all those clothes away now, man.  You don't dare while he's going to throw all those clothes away now.  Yes, he's got to.  A big piece of pudding right in the middle of his stupid hat.  And it's a yellow A's hat.  Like, the bill is yellow.  The pudding's all the way over here.  Yeah, the pudding went everywhere.  I got a piece of my eye.  A piece of pudding.  You haven't seen fucking pudding come apart like that.  That's the way Bill Cosby laughs at you, man. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Well, that's...  All right.  That was...  Wow.  That was riveting.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Stop slapping yourself.  Oh, stop.  It couldn't feel right.  Stop.  Wow.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Calm down.  You want to...  Relax.  Duct tape his hands or something.  He looks like one of those Japanese videos.  All he needs is a girl in a wedding dress.  That's like a little German porn.  German...  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Scheisse.  I don't do.  All right.  Don't duct tape his hands.  I don't know.  Because it's...  I'm on an egg for crying out loud or something like that.  An egg?  How do you keep an egg in my hand?  I don't know.  That's exactly it.  Stop taking the egg.  Brilliant.  Oh.  It's fucking big slap.  Fuck.  This nigga here.  Dude, he's got...  I'm fucking on suicide bomb.  You losing weight?  Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  Hey, uh...  Go down to the park and watch the fucking... 
[01:37:30]  What are you doing?  The Muslims preach and shit in there.  Boom.  What did you do?  Patrice.  You losing weight?  I'm trying to, yeah.  I noticed that, too, as soon as he came.  You lost...  You didn't look at that.  Looks like you lost a lot of weight.  Because you didn't look at it.  You didn't look at it.  I noticed it when it flew right in the middle of your hat.  Someone give Patrice a wireless.  You don't want to be near that microphone, Patrice.  No, no, no.  We're trying to cure him of his Tourette's today.  We found out that he has a new take.  You have to slap his face.  Yeah.  I got back from a Tourette's Syndrome convention at the TSA conference, and being around so many  people just really triggered it. 
[01:38:00]  What time?  Tomorrow night, Jimmy?  Tomorrow.  The big...  Here's the big show.  It's the short bus tour, 8 o'clock at the Laugh Back.  9 o'clock.  9 o'clock.  No, 8 o'clock to get tickets.  It's going to be sold out.  Yeah.  The whole gang is coming.  They're all going to watch Twitch in.  Oh, no.  Slap.  They're all going to watch.  Oh, no.  They're all going to...  You won't get any.  You know what?  It's fine.  Clear the monitor.  Oh, clear everything over there.  Oh, my God.  You can control this.  Oh, my brand new...  You can control this.  I predict yellow.  This will look just like there's a Bruder film. 
[01:38:30]  And his left hand is a...  A handful of ketchup.  Get plastic and throw it over that monitor as quickly as you can.  Get on the plastic.  Puri, come on.  Run.  Get plastic.  It's okay.  He's okay.  He's not going to do it.  Just for the equipment.  Just slap it.  Just jump.  Just jump.  Oh, God.  All you want to do is jump.  You just want to jump.  Tomorrow night, big show, 9 o'clock.  It's going to be the short bus tour.  We're all going to be there.  Colin's coming down.  Right after Laugh Factory.  Laugh Factory.  Big plug for Twitch. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  It's...  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  It's all over the place.  It's going to be a big show.  You know.  Oh, it got all over Steve.  It's the Opie and Anthony sign.  It's all over me, man.  It's everywhere.  It's on the Stemmins Freeway sign.  Make him do the curling run on his door.  Make him do the paper towels.  It's Nick Long.  This fucking asshole.  Fuck you.  Jackie O's crawling on the back of his chair looking for his hat. 
[01:39:30]  Fuck it up.  He was close.  It's in my hand.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that got everywhere, man.  Well, Opie, your therapy's progressing.  Yeah, you're making progress.  Well, I think...  Hey, you got to dump some of those in his hand now.  Wait, wait, wait.  Jamie, now.  Wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  What are they?  Let me see.  They're Danny's pubes.  Let me see.  I can't do this.  You put your food in a cup?  Yeah.  I can't do it.  Are you sick, man?  What the fuck is...  I can't do it.  Because I know it's...  No, no, no.  We're going to cure you. 
[01:40:00]  We're going to cure you.  This is a cure.  Yeah, this is a cure.  Don't worry about it.  How about a little vanilla icing first?  Because everyone...  Yeah, vanilla icing.  It smells good.  It certainly does.  Vanilla icing.  God, would I love a giant spoonful?  Oh, gosh.  What?  He almost put his eye out with the spoon.  All right, listen, listen.  Hog was trying to spoon some out into his hand, and he went to smack himself and hit the  whole thing.  Yeah, just fucking...  Just scoop his hands in there, you fucking girls.  What's the matter with you guys, dinky? 
[01:40:30]  You tell him to me.  Come on, Miss Manners.  Put it in his fucking hand.  Yeah, come on.  Who wouldn't want to just...  Yeah, grab a handful of that if he can.  Yeah, you're okay, Twitchels.  Yeah.  All right.  There it is.  There you go.  There you go.  You're not going to do it.  Tomorrow night, 9 o'clock, get some tickets to the short bus tour.  Twitchels is actually a very good comic.  We're all going to be there.  It gets him excited to think about his big night tomorrow.  Hey, if we have plastic, we really need to start getting plastic in the studio, because...  Yeah, exactly.  There's chocolate and ketchup all over the board.  Good timing.  You're not going to slap yourself.  You're going to be fine.  Yeah, you don't need to slap yourself anymore. 
[01:41:00]  You don't need to slap yourself anymore, see?  You're trying to help.  You don't need to slap.  That's great.  It won't look like a Bukkake video after this one.  Nah, you don't need to slap.  Wow.  Yeah, you're good.  Relax.  Look, you don't need to do this.  I don't need to do this.  You don't need to do this.  Look, you don't need to do this.  Just relax.  Take a deep breath.  Okay.  This doesn't feel good at all.  No.  It doesn't feel good.  You're jumping all over the place.  You just got to relax.  Calm down.  I just got to think of a nice place.  Yeah, a nice place.  Exactly.  I just got to...  I'll be fine.  I can do this. 
[01:41:30]  No, really, I can do this.  He's playing both bars and what love got to do with it.  See, you're doing good.  You don't need to slap your face.  See, it's done.  You're done.  Pretend you just heard Riverteam out in the line.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  All right.  We got it.  Why, I, I, I...  Hey, Mo.  Hey, Mo.  Holy shit.  Like a gangbang video. 
[01:42:00]  This is awful.  He's all the three stooges.  He's got balls cut.  Why, yeah, he smacks himself.  Wise guy.  Come on, porcupine.  He's curly and shamp and, and curly Joe.  Oh, my God.  All right, well.  There's white all over his face.  We need some type of cleaner on that sign now.  You look like Fez after New Year's Eve.  Windex or something.  That's going to be a big show.  How do you guys feel about this? 
[01:42:30]  You feel good?  I think it's helping.  Yeah, there's a lot of crap in my hair right now.  I feel the healing.  Please dump that cup into his hands.  Please put that cup...  Yes, yes.  Oh, I can't do it.  You won't.  You'll be fine.  Hey, man, we've got to cure you of the Tourette's.  This will cure you.  I can't do it.  I can't do the cure.  I know.  The studio is being...  I know that you won't.  No, I'm not.  You'll be okay.  Nobody can make that happen.  Put the gloves on.  You will control yourself.  I can't do it.  You will.  You will control yourself.  I won't.  Do you think I should do it?  Yes, yes, yes.  Do you honestly think I should?  You will control yourself.  I don't think you'll slap yourself with it is why I think you should do it. 
[01:43:00]  The best part of this...  I think that's the thing that'll keep you from...  I think this is the first time Danny's ever, like, trimmed up.  It's like a fucking force in that game.  Here's what it is.  Oh, God.  You know how when you chew your nails, they...  It's a bottom positive part of the sign.  Keep going.  Keep going.  They put a glove on you.  They put something on your nails to stop you from chewing.  Right.  It's psychos...  We have nail biting problems.  So this is kind of the same thing.  The other stuff is all food.  Duff in his hand.  Yeah, but Tourette's is completely uncontrollable.  I know that, but there's times when you're acting where you don't feel it. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, you're acting and it's obvious, though.  But this will be such an overwhelming thing that it will...  That's what I'm talking about, man.  Wow.  It'll counteract.  It'll counteract me.  That's how I'm asking you to get in my face.  You know what?  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  It'll counteract it.  I'll try.  I'll try.  Hold on.  You don't honestly think you had a choice, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Louis, he's going to feel a little bit better knowing.  Sweet Louis, he's going to dump someone to each hand.  Will you stop being tender if he doesn't have a knife?  Fucking...  All right, no.  Go ahead.  Get him in there.  Sprinkle liberally in each hand. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Pubes are going into...  Oh, God damn it.  Make sure they stick to the stuff there.  Reach over and do the other hand, too, Danny.  What are you, a queer?  Oh, my God.  Now press him on there.  Press him on there.  You've got to leave him in there, Twitchels.  Yeah, yeah.  No, there was some hanging around there.  Oh, that's good.  There it is.  There's no way.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  Danny's pubes.  Holy crap.  I don't think I'm going to lick the icing anymore.  Oh, my God.  Danny's pubes.  Now you can...  Just relax.  That is a lot.  Now you control yourself, right? 
[01:44:30]  Wait.  Watch us cure Tourette.  We have a treatment here at the clinic.  The Opioid Anthony Institute.  That's right.  We'll show you how to cure Tourette.  We've got to explain.  The dick face treatment.  Anthony, we've got to explain, though.  I mean, that is a lot of pubes.  People at home are thinking, eh, maybe one or two.  I don't think he has any fucking last.  It is...  Danny looks like he'd be a hairy guy.  It looks like a huge clump.  And if you've ever seen Danny's nuts and dick on Pal Talks, you know there's a lot of  hair down there.  It looks like he's holding good times and coolly high. 
[01:45:00]  Just call up Danny's mom and ask him how many pubes Danny has, and she'll tell you.  See, you're doing good, man.  You're doing good.  You're tough.  By the way...  Your hand wants to slap.  Oh, God.  You want to slap.  You do, but you're just going to be okay.  See, you can't slap the pubes on your face.  Danny didn't even shower today.  Yeah, they're sweaty.  Don't.  He doesn't shower before you...  Oh, you're scratching your nose at Danny's pubes.  No, no, no, no.  I see.  No, that finger is...  Don't slap.  Don't slap.  The icing is getting lodged in my nostril.  I know.  Did someone help me blow my nose at you? 
[01:45:30]  No, you're okay.  You're free to your mouth.  It's okay.  Don't slap.  Shut up.  You don't need to slap.  You don't need to slap.  The Tourette's thing is all in your mind, dude.  Big show tomorrow night.  It's at 9 o'clock at the Laugh Factory.  The Laugh Factory, the Short Bus Comedy Tour.  Myself, Jimmy Graham, Mike Attal, Tim Grill.  We all have disability.  What's the phone number?  Oh, God.  It's go to LaughFactory.com.  We don't have the number off and that's the Laugh Factory right in Times Square.  Is it on 42nd?  42nd Street.  You're working.  It's one of the biggest clubs now.  It's going well for you.  We're all coming down to see you.  After doing this, I'm dead serious. 
[01:46:00]  I want you guys there.  Yeah, we will all be there.  Absolutely.  Nah.  We are curing.  Oh.  You're okay.  We are curing Tourette.  We're all coming to see you tomorrow.  Look how close you came, but you were able to control it.  He almost broke his wrist.  Trying to keep that fucking pubic.  He was.  He was.  He was like a Chinese contortionist.  He slapped his hand in midair and everything else went forward.  He wants to. 
[01:46:30]  You know what?  I bet the icing is really fucking him up, too.  Can you let me try to do something to calm this?  Can I read something?  Reading.  Let me take my guess off.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  DaWise.  It's so good.  It's so nice to slap your face.  There's no way you're going to slap your face.  There's no way you're going to slap your face.  You'll want to slap your face.  You're almost cure.  You're not going to slap your face히.  You're not going to slap.  You know it's going to make everything OK, but you don't need to do it.  That's right. 
[01:47:00]  There are other ways.  There's other ways.  I significantly.  I just have an image of my head slapping my face right now.  Ah.  This is really hard.  you know it would feel good.  I can't cry because the icing's in the way.  You know it would feel good.  But you don't need to do it.  You don't need to slap your face.  I'm doing it now, and it doesn't seem to spin it as much.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's spitting out Danny's pubes.  He's spitting out Danny's pubes.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God, no. 
[01:47:30]  Let me see your hand.  Oh, he's spitting Danny's pubes out.  Oh, my God, is this funny slash really sad?  Can you get something?  Can you help me with my eye?  I got it.  Can you wipe his eye?  He's got Danny's pubes in his eye.  Wipe his eye.  Somebody help him.  Exactly.  All right, how do you even get them out of yours?  Oh, he smacked Hawk's arm.  That's right.  Hawk's got Danny's pubes all over his arm. 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit.  That's right.  Wipe it off.  Oh, my God.  I can't see that at all.  I can't see now at all.  I need to sort of help me get the stuff out of my eyes.  Wipe his eyes.  Hey, fucking help him out over there.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  You're okay.  You're going to be okay.  He's removing Danny's pubes from his elbow.  Holy crap. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, he didn't see that coming.  It's burning my left eye.  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  That's the funniest thing ever.  Holy shit.  Ever.  Oh, you got some on your elbow there, huh?  Don't slap again.  Don't slap again.  You can get a whole bunch of pubes that were left here.  I hope we're describing that.  He had a handful of pubes.  A handful of pubes that went right on the Hawk's arm.  He went to slap his face, and Eric put his arm in the right, and he's got pubes and white  sticky stuff all over his arm.  The underside of his arm.  Holy faggot. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my.  That side hasn't been slapped.  That side's doing okay.  The right one, you did it, but that left one, you didn't do it.  Yeah, the left side still has a whole handful of Danny's pubes in it.  You know that weird feeling when your face just rocks with that thing?  Yeah.  Really weird.  Oh, my God.  That feels good.  Wow.  You don't want to do that, though.  I know.  You don't want to do it.  And you're trying to cure the Tourette.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Okay.  This is all for my benefit.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  I believe you're okay.  We're doing the work of God.  Big Laugh Factory show.  Yeah.  Laugh Factory.  Switching tape?  Well, then switch it.  Go ahead.  It was stall.  Yeah, hurry up. 
[01:49:30]  Tomorrow night, 9 o'clock, at the Laugh Factory, in time square.  Have you seen you in a while?  Yeah.  Lucky you.  Lucky you.  Hard to make small talk with another man's pubes stuck to your face with icing.  Good to see you.  How's your dignity?  I haven't seen her in a while.  You're not going to have a...  Hey, what else?  What else?  You're not going to have a walk around New York like this, right?  Hold on.  We got Piers in his left hand, still in his left hand.  Why would we do that?  No, don't do that.  What can we put in his right hand? 
[01:50:00]  Peanut butter?  Peanut butter?  Peanut butter.  Look at this.  Look at this.  There's a video of Voss on last comic stand.  Hey, man.  Anthony.  Hot sauce.  Yeah.  Guys, there's little clumps of the icing and there's a pubic hair like popping through  one of the clumps.  Yeah.  Thicken up.  And this one still is full and this is just like, it's starting to get wedged underneath  one of my fingernails.  Oh, man.  One of the pubes.  You're going to slap.  And it's like, really.  It has to happen.  Oh, God.  Here, hold this egg.  Take it.  Just hold this egg.  No, don't give him the egg.  He'll hit his face with the egg.  No egg.  No.  No, I don't want the egg.  Hold the egg. 
[01:50:30]  All right, I'll take the egg.  Just hold the egg.  Just hold it.  If you drop it, we throw the entire eggs at you.  Oh, my God.  What?  No.  That'll relax you.  Yeah, relax.  See, relax.  Relax.  Look, the egg is just balanced in your right hand.  The pubes are in your left.  Danny's pubes in your left hand.  A whole pile of them.  You guys are humanitarians.  What you're doing is great.  The pubes will not end up on your face.  We know that.  Well, you got some on the right side of your face.  We understand that.  I see no bell.  See, you were able to control it.  What were you, an inch away from slapping your face, right? 
[01:51:00]  And you stopped.  And you stopped.  See?  You don't want to slap with that left hand.  Anyone want pubic hair eggs?  Look at all the pubes on his cheek.  And he just slapped with the egg in his hand.  It didn't really do much damage.  No, very hard to break an egg.  No, no, no more slaps with the left hand.  Look, he's using his right hand too much.  He knows.  You got to get something in his right hand.  I'm focusing on my right hand.  I don't want the left hand to hit me.  Why don't you throw a left?  Throw some, yeah, throw another egg in his hand.  Exactly.  No, no, no more slaps. 
[01:51:30]  That one kind of cracked.  See, what's going on here, he does want to use his left hand because he doesn't want  the pubes on his face.  So he's using his right hand to slap his face.  He's got pubes stuck to his face.  The right side.  The left side.  Yeah, but not as much because that left hand has a pile of pubes.  I don't look too bad, right?  No.  Not at all.  It needs to be balanced.  All right, thank you.  It looks like a slap happy video.  Yeah.  Just running down your face.  The icing and honey.  Oh, shit.  Look at the back of his head.  Oh, shit.  Look at the back of his head.  Exactly.  Turn around, turn around.  Oh, you got nails. 
[01:52:00]  Egg right in the back.  What's your name?  Sean.  Egg right in the back of Sean's head.  He missed his face.  The egg went flying across the room into the wall.  Sean in the back of the head.  Which is now washing.  The egg is washing the chocolate off the wall.  Right.  All right.  Well, maybe we shouldn't use the eggs anymore.  There goes Sean leaving the studio as a direct hit to his head.  Boy, has he taken out a lot of people.  Eggs to the head, pubes to the arm.  Fucking pudding to the hat.  Pudding to the hat.  Whenever I try to control it, I usually bite my lower lip, and I just took a mouthful of 
[01:52:30]  pubes.  Yeah.  I'm dead serious.  That would be bad.  See, this is worse all around.  It's like interacting with my focus now.  Yeah.  All right.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  You looking forward to the show tomorrow night?  I'm really looking forward to it.  Hey, do we have more chocolate pudding left?  Are you looking forward to it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait because we've got a whole bunch of people coming down.  Awesome.  Colin said he's coming.  Patrice, myself, Phil Burr.  It's going to be a lot of Bob Kelly.  It's going to be all the guys from the show.  We got Lorne Michaels.  He's going to stop by.  Oh, come on.  Stop it. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, he's a friend of ours.  Don't get too excited about that, though.  He sees a lot of comedians.  I mean, don't put him in the left hand yet.  Not that big of a deal.  Not the left hand, Eric.  Too inside what?  Don't do lefty.  Don't.  The left hand, man.  I know you want to hit.  You know the right hand's not getting the job done, by the way.  You know the right hand's slapping your face is not getting the job done.  Obviously, it is because I'm managing the control of the left hand.  Exactly.  That's why we know it's all in your head.  It's working.  This is our cure.  Your left hand does not need to slap.  Only your right.  So your left hand's fine. 
[01:53:30]  You're not going to use it.  Yeah, don't slap on your left hand.  The right hand has another pile of chocolate pudding in it.  Unfortunately, that might end up on your face, but the left hand's still holding strong with the pubic hair in it.  Have you ever done both together?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the two hands would probably feel great.  Oh, the two hands.  No, you don't want to do it.  You're controlling it.  Twitchels, you're so close to being cured.  We can see it.  Yeah.  We can see it.  Don't give in to the beast.  This is starting to become noticeable, by the way. 
[01:54:00]  You can just do both hands together.  Yeah, if we both, if everyone goes like this in the studio, look.  So what?  Just putting, I can hurt you.  Like it matters.  Look, if we all do this, if we all do this, see, nothing happens.  No, no, don't all do it.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Just think about that.  Slap.  Slap in the face.  Both sides.  Slap.  Both together feels right.  Yeah, it feels really good, Jimmy.  That does feel right.  There's something about it.  There's something wrong about just one.  But when you do golf, it feels perfect.  It's very calming.  It's perfect.  Always right with the world when you do this. 
[01:54:30]  It's perfect.  Wow, this does work.  Oh, my God.  This feels good.  I feel like I'm in a womb or something.  You think he's slick.  Yeah.  I think he hit that other kid on purpose with that egg.  I think you came in too late to see what's been going on here.  Excuse me, Captain.  Excuse me.  I got pubic fucking hairs on my face.  Oh, shut up, bitch.  Stop being a bitch and slap yourself with the pubes.  So we can move on to the comedy with Patrice O'Neal.  We're just kidding.  I think we give a shit. 
[01:55:00]  So we can clean up the front row at the Gallagher show.  Exactly.  Oh, there's more pubes in his mouth.  Oh, shit.  There's the showstopper.  Hey, both hands.  Slap his face really hard.  Pubes all over his face.  Chocolate pudding to the right of his face.  And Danny's pubes on the left side of his face.  Toretto manic. 
[01:55:30]  He now looks like an old man that can't get the shave done.  There's always something left over after he's shitting.  This is bordering on exploiting this illness.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Well, I got to say, I don't think our cure works, Opie.  Yeah.  Well, we tried, though.  Yeah.  We tried.  It's the effort to cancel.  It's trial on earth.  Phase one testing, Opie.  He's going to bring the stock down because it didn't really work very well.  Yeah.  We're really banking on phase two.  You know, you really, truly describe this as a scientific... 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  I came in late, but you could prove this to be scientific.  It is scientific.  Just look at him.  Yeah.  Next week, we're going to try the cure alcoholism.  Okay.  Feel research.  Toretto's not cure by putting shit in the hand.  Yeah, now someone can take note of that and now not waste their time doing this.  That's right.  Go on to the next thing.  Try something else.  I'm dead serious.  This is a fucking scientific proof.  This is damn strange. 
[01:56:30]  Can I clean myself up now?  Wait a minute.  Pubic hair might have a 50% effect.  Right.  The one hand.  You want to slap yourself with the pubic hair?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure they're going to start subscribing.  Further research must be done.  All right.  Why don't we get him outside in the streets of Manhattan in front of the building?  Give it to announce it didn't work.  All right.  Make sure he doesn't clean up.  Let's get him outside.  Maybe Danny or someone could call on the phone.  That's right.  All right.  Twitchels, why don't you...  Just try to be incognito on the elevator. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  How do I get out of here?  Just walk.  We'll open all the doors for you.  You'll be fine.  It's all over my feet.  Where's the comedy show tomorrow?  Tomorrow night at the Laugh Factory in Times Square, 9 o'clock, is the Short Bus Comedy Tour.  I'm dead serious.  You don't mean a lot to me if you guys are there.  I, uh, I wouldn't get your hopes up.  All right.  You bastard.  All right.  Walk out now.  In the corner.  You're showing up.  In the corner.  In between.  Fucking. 
[01:57:30]  It's between help and me.  It's fucking complete idiot.  Oh, my God.  Look, is that a big clump of pube and icing on the arm of the chair?  That chair has to be thrown out.  The best part.  I came here all dressed cute for you guys.  I've never seen you in a while.  You're on your A's shit.  I have a brand new A's shit.  My green stripe on my fucking Nike is a match.  The second he opened the door, you got ambushed.  Like a suicide bomb.  I noticed how it goes down.  Like a fucking, like a Chinese food delivery man in the Bronx.  Open the door, boom, right in the face. 
[01:58:00]  It wouldn't be bad if this was like a Cleveland Browns hat with a color.  But this is fucking nice yellow and yellow.  I don't know.  Patrice.  Will you ever wear that hat again?  I gotta buy another hat.  Yeah, you gotta buy another one.  That sucks.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry we did that too.  It's over for the hat.  They paid for some great ratings.  I'm mad with that.  Look, I'm walking around with a big stain on the fucking hat.  Yeah, we can't do that.  It doesn't work.  Hey, are we calling?  Yeah.  We will be.  All right.  Should we take a quick break?  You can if you want.  Yeah, we should take a break.  When we get back, we'll have Twitchells live on the streets of Manhattan.  Looking like a complete lunatic. 
[01:58:30]  Looking like a mess.  Looking like?  Chocolate pudding all over his face.  And ketchup still remaining on his face.  Pubic hair is all over his face.  All over his shirt that he's wearing.  And with the twitching, we're going to get some good looks from these dopes out there.  Do you know chocolate made it all the way almost to my keyboard?  Hit me in the eye.  Did it?  It's right there.  Oh, there's some here.  It's in my hair.  Jesus Christ.  It's on the phone screen.  There's a pube right here.  You got hair and thing.  There's no pube over here.  I know the velocity potential of the pubic hair and it could not have made it over here. 
[01:59:00]  Hawk got it all over his arm.  That was probably the funniest part.  Danny pubes all over his arm.  He went to wipe off Twitchells' face.  And the second he put his arm over there, Twitchells freaked out, smacked him, and just got pubic hair and icing all over Hawk's arm.  Let's say hi to Ken in Missouri.  Ken.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Ken.  Hey, you guys keep saying this is the cure.  I wasn't aware that dignity was a disease.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:59:30]  You guys are killing me.  I'm punching out.  I think a lot of people might have turned off their XM radio today.  Could be.  Could be.  I don't know how that works.  Better than doing it to a mouse.  Yeah.  Better mouse.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Who's Kenny Loggins over there?  Where?  Oh, that's, uh, that's intern Bill.  What happened to you?  Kenny Loggins.  What happened to you? 
[02:00:00]  We never pulled that one out.  That is fucking funny, man.  Christ.  Kenny Loggins.  A foot loose.  A foot loose.  It looks fucking ridiculous.  I'm all right.  He grew that over the weekend, so.  He's one of those guys.  He's one of those guys.  Oh, God.  All right.  Why don't we, why don't we. 
[02:00:30]  This is it.  Make no mistakes where you are.  Who the fuck is that?  That's Mike McDonald and Kenny Loggins.  It's a duet.  If that was all white, he could be, uh, Mike McDonald.  Oh, Danny's already outside.  Let's, uh, let's go to Danny.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, buddy.  Say again? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, what's up?  Uh, well, we're on the street here in front of the building, uh, with twichels.  He's still covered in shit.  Right.  And, uh, we did not let him wash, uh, anything off of him.  So he's still got pubes all over himself, pudding, icing, everything.  He's a mess.  Is he getting some good looks out there?  Well, yeah.  I mean, he's, uh, he's ticking, uh, very badly and obviously covered in shit.  How could you not stare at him?  Got to get some of the, uh, the, the stares.  I'll try and hold the phone towards him so you can hear, uh, you can hear him ticking. 
[02:01:30]  What?  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  What am I talking to you?  You should say, I don't want to look, Steve, but I'm giving you this idea.  Are you right outside our door?  Out of the building?  Um, almost.  If you'd like, we can move so that you can see us.  If you'd like, we can move across the street so you can easily see out the window.  Yeah, out across the street so we can watch you out the window.  Yeah, move across the street.  Someone take the, I'll hang here, just take the wireless or something.  Oh, wait, we can see through there, right?  I'm just going to cross the street so bear with me.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  We're going to, we're going to cross the street so you can see out the window.  All right, hang in.  Traffic.  Holy crap.  Oh, what happened?  Well, we lost him.  He probably flung the phone into the street.  Oh, that was really, really funny, man.  Now clean up this mess!  You guinea brat! 
[02:02:30]  Go on and twitch, just like your father.  I love the clean-up portion of this.  Oh, Danny's back.  It makes the studio smell so nice.  Danny.  Hey, sorry, guys, the phone cut out.  All right.  All right, well, across the street, you should be able to see us right now.  Can you see anything yet?  Uh, I can never see out of this.  Yeah, I see Danny.  I see Danny.  He's off to the left there.  Are they avoiding twitchels, or is he getting any looks? 
[02:03:00]  It's New York.  No one even notices him.  No, we've got our nice young lady right here who's absolutely, uh, entranced by the situation.  She sounds it.  Oh, you're hanging out with me?  Yeah, well, uh, uh, I can't hear them.  He won't let me, he won't let me hold the phone.  Well, I mean, he's got, he's got icing and shit all over his face.  I'm not giving him my phone.  And your pubes. 
[02:03:30]  We should just have Twitchels start yelling, help me, help me, help me.  Twitchels!  Danny!  Danny!  Danny!  I can barely hear you.  Twitchels, we want you to start yelling, help me, help me.  Start yelling, help me?  Yeah.  That's not a check.  You mean you just want me to do it?  Yeah, if you want a plug for your comedy show tomorrow, I would suggest you start yelling, help me, help me, help me.  Like where? 
[02:04:00]  Like just right where I'm standing now?  Yeah.  Kind of walk around in circles.  Give the phone back to Danny and start yelling, help me, help me, help me.  He said, give the phone back to you and start yelling, help me.  Okay, so that's what you guys want?  Yeah.  Okay, hang on.  Where's he at?  Okay.  Is he there?  Okay.  Help me!  Oh, my God.  People are running away.  They're running away.  He won't help me.  He won't help me!  Help me.  Can you help me? 
[02:04:30]  Can you help me?  Yeah.  I've never seen New Yorkers alarmed or shocked by anything.  They're like giving him a wide berth and running.  Danny went to make him say something on the phone and he went to slap his face.  He knocked stupid Danny's phone on the concrete.  Oh, man.  That was the last thing we ever heard from Danny's phone was a loud beeping noise.  And he's laughing hysterical, Danny, as his phone is broken.  That's right.  All right.  Enough with that nonsense.  I know.  Enough is enough. 
[02:05:00]  Enough with that Tourette's.  Exactly.  Now let's just start announcing that the show is canceled.  Everyone knows.  Tourette's is the disease.  We're the cure.  God, Regis decided to dye his hair a little darker than usual.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, my God.  That looks normal on a 76-year-old man.  Yes.  He's got the Ronald Reagan hair.  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  All right.  Oh, wait.  He's back?  No, it can't be.  That phone is busted. 
[02:05:30]  Look at Ben's hairdo.  Daddy.  Where?  Daddy.  It's awful.  Hey, sock him on.  Hey, Florence Henderson.  He should be on a lesbian cruise with that hair gun.  Fucking that bob cut is atrocious.  Nice do.  Yeah, Ben.  He just nods at you.  You can almost hear him just calling you an asshole.  Are those Lysol sanitary wipes?  Ben, are we going to be all right?  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  We're just trying to clean up the studio.  Danny.  Yo.  Hey, Danny.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  Like I said, Eric's phone took some damage, but I'm on another phone.  Oh, that was Eric's phone?  Eric's phone.  Oh, that's why you were laughing so hard.  I was wondering why he was laughing at his own broken phone.  What happened when he started yelling, help me, help me?  I mean, people were absolutely just, they just wanted to run away, actually, like, going  straight up to, you know, people trying to get to work and just screaming, help me in 
[02:06:30]  this place.  They were running, yeah.  Do we have video of this?  Oh, absolutely.  All right.  Are we done?  Yes, we're done.  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  For the day.  Welcome, fellas.  All right.  The last thing, push him under a bus.  Good to do that.  I say we don't let Twitchels back into the studio because he's embarrassing himself.  Please cut that shit out.  Yeah, you know, have some pride, man.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Alan Light is here, by the way, too.  Huh?  Alan Light.  Right there. 
[02:07:00]  What was the last thing he had to come in the middle of, too?  He showed up at some other weird thing.  Oh, we'll ask him, yeah.  The NTAH group.  The what?  The NTAH group.  Oh, crap.  And that was the last time we did anything crazy in here.  That's the only reason Alan Light came back, because we didn't get into anything, because  silly stuff was going on around him.  All right, we'll talk some music with Alan Light.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in the studio and other things to get to.  Boots always bring this show to a hall.  Oh, screeching hall.  I don't believe it.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday. 
[02:07:30]  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is beautiful.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Wow.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Wow.  Those are real.  Wow, that's cool.  How about the woman that took the shirt off?  Ah, yeah.  Sexy girl.  Sex, sexy girl.  You have size?  Wow.  Girls show boobs.  Boobs.  I see boobs.  Boobs.  Yes.  He just got wowed. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  Hey.  It was amazing.  That's nice.  Wolfie and Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  Yeah.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Those are real.  Cancel your appointment.  Okay.  It's Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  It's Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whipple Mountain Wednesday.  Huh?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[02:08:30]  I'm trying to push buttons so we can talk on the radio, but there's like...  Are they goopy?  Oh, there's pudding on CD number two. 
[02:09:00]  There's frosting on Ant's mic.  Hawk.  Get that.  Yeah.  I cleaned up over here, and then I Purelled.  I love you really got...  Give me some Purell.  You really got fucking Eric working like a goddamn slave.  Hey, man.  Clean that off, Coonton.  Like.  Like.  He is the slave of the program.  See, we do this every once in a while.  Because we know these guys are sitting around going, you know, they're coasting.  Oh, no.  We're going to make you work eventually. 
[02:09:30]  One of those days.  Oh, good.  They used some kind of cleaner on the grand Opie and Anthony sign.  Oh, thank God the Opie and Anthony sign is all clean.  Took a hit with some ketchup.  Hey, I went by the...  By the way, the Javits Center.  XM has a nice presence at the Javits Center, man.  You're right over the big entrance.  You got like a picture of Snoop, a picture of Cal Ripken, a picture of somebody else.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Everybody involved and on the platform.  Absolutely.  Except maybe.  Except maybe guys that do a show every day.  Nah.  That's not right.  Oh, you're right.  Hockey. 
[02:10:00]  And they do a show for more than a half hour.  Jeter and Snoop and hockey.  Right.  Hey, did you hit a homer last night?  No.  Exactly.  No?  No.  I couldn't even get jerked off for money.  Yeah, of course.  Hey, we have to say hi to Alan Light.  Hi, Alan.  Hello, you guys.  Sorry to make you wait.  Hey, man.  Last time I was in here, it was a guy tweezing his pubic hair.  Oh, that's right.  This time I'm in here, I don't know what it, you know.  Dude, I got to say, it's not usually pubes.  See, my number's coming up wrong here.  I don't know what.  Not just pubic hair.  We usually stay away from the pubic hair. 
[02:10:30]  It's usually the whole package.  Dick, balls, and pubes.  Yeah.  We like it.  Men.  Yeah.  Bunch of men with a mouthful.  Draining each other out.  And I was asking Patrice O'Neill, because he has all his brand new A's stuff, even though  he doesn't like the A's.  It just looks good on him.  It just looks good.  I don't know.  I really want to understand.  I watch WebJunk 20, and he comes on looking like a Pokemon.  There's just so many colors and things, and it's like a uniform. 
[02:11:00]  You can name one A.  Not even.  It could be the Oakland Z's, motherfucker.  Green and yellow.  Doesn't matter, right?  Doesn't matter.  It's good.  Every once in a while, I'll buy a Mets cap or an Islanders cap.  I hate wearing the Mets cap, because they just haven't figured that out yet.  They look ridiculous still.  Well, Mets caps, I've got to say, I know a lot of Mets fans here in New York, but Mets  caps are great for girls and old men. 
[02:11:30]  Awful NW, that curly.  It's terrible, terrible merchandising.  They're corn balls.  No, I know it's terrible, because you don't see the brothers wearing the Mets gear at all.  Never.  At all.  It's like blue or red.  Yeah, there's some orange in there.  It's good colors.  Blue is usually a very safe color.  They pick the only type of blue that's not safe.  You know what I mean?  You are so right.  I've never noticed you never see a brother wearing Mets stuff, because it doesn't look  good.  No.  Not even in the field. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, the brothers are like, aw, man, trade the Mets.  Gotta wear this shit.  Yeah.  It's fucking up my game, man.  Yankee's got to be number one, man.  Oh, yeah.  Everywhere you go.  It's ridiculous, man.  They got the greatest hats you'll ever see.  That's like, we have an N.Y. here, too.  Why isn't ours as popular?  It's like a curly...  It's like some written in a calligraphy pen or something.  Oh, I hear you, hear you.  You are a New York Mets fan.  So why the A's gear?  I just bought a whole bunch at once. 
[02:12:30]  I have bought a Cincinnati Reds.  You buy a bunch of different teams and just hang it up.  I'll go to a Red Sox game in a Cincinnati Reds.  What is Red?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You got Red in a name?  I ain't got to represent them, but I'm just saying it.  It just doesn't look good.  Did you save money for more than a month?  He gets fucking money, and you always know Patrice has a gig because he's got a new ring  or a new outfit.  I have learned from my friend Anthony Cumia, who I'm complaining, taking off my top eight  because it's really not doing me any good because it's so fucking selfish. 
[02:13:00]  I'll put you on my top eight.  I'm putting a couple of people, this asshole, nothing.  I took a little cab off.  I'll tell you the truth of the matter with my top eight.  I haven't changed it in so long on MySpace because you can't search through 20,000 friends  to find anybody.  I'm not going to sit there and go, here's one page.  That takes care of 10 people.  All right.  Only 19,900 more to go.  I'm sorry.  I'm not nigga rich no more. 
[02:13:30]  No.  I needed these clothes.  You need clothes in show business.  Yeah.  You know, if you're black.  I look good.  I'm not sure white people need clothes.  But just because there's a tiny spot of pudding on the hat.  No, that's got to go.  That's garbage.  It's destroyed, right?  No way of saving that.  You know what?  That should be on a homeless guy's head by noon today.  It's gone.  Actually, sign it.  We'll throw it on eBay.  You're just going to...  Yeah, right?  You're putting on his top of sleep?  On the top of his jacket?  Yeah, the Tourette's...  The Tourette's putting hat.  The Tourette's putting hat.  And what else do you have to destroy? 
[02:14:00]  Pretty much the whole outfit?  No, because you can watch this.  You're going to be all right with the ace top?  Yeah, you can't watch the hat, though.  Nah.  So I'll sign it.  That's cool.  Yeah, but I wanted to say your house made me try to save.  Yeah, try to save a little.  I'm jealous of your fucking crib.  I got to get me a...  So I got to get out of this situation.  Got to get something nice.  I really am awful nice.  People saw how I lived.  They'll be like, is this how the web junk nigga lives?  You got to grow up.  The ONA web junk Letterman nigga.  Look at what he's doing.  Look at how he seeks the Letterman in there. 
[02:14:30]  Me and DL, man, we got along.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Dude, you had a great spot.  You had a great spot with Letterman.  He sat me down.  Talking about the web junk.  Yeah.  Got to just sit and talk.  That's pretty damn cool, man.  I was going to try to sneak the radio in there, but he was kind of driving there.  I was going to try to sneak the radio in there.  He steers it pretty good?  He just steers it pretty good.  I enjoyed that.  That's good.  Keeps you on track.  I'm going to go see D-Bone again in July.  Oh, D-Bone.  That is a pal.  And now they don't have to do stand-up to sit down either.  A lot of shows, you've got to do stand-up first. 
[02:15:00]  Then they call you over and stuff.  Right.  But they just say, come on, sit down, Patrice.  Are you trying to make fun of our little pal?  He doesn't.  What happened?  Well, no, I know.  He performs?  Yeah, he does a little stand-up first.  I can't let that go.  I can't say that name.  What's that name you said?  J-Lot.  I can't say that name because they said I'm to exclusively just do Letterman.  Do you have the funny part?  Late night, I can't.  I can't say the L word.  Here's the funny part. 
[02:15:30]  I do the L word.  Again, fucking D-L's people called us.  We'd like to have you here, too.  You're kidding me.  We said thanks, but no thanks.  Wow.  Are you serious?  Oh, look at that.  Are you serious?  Why?  Should they tell you?  Loyalty, my friend.  I prefer the L.  I like Cushion's L.  Do you understand they're both L?  Letterman and Leno?  They're both L-E.  L-E.  Jesus.  It's true.  Look at all these.  East Coast, West Coast.  Yeah.  Well, there you go. 
[02:16:00]  Fool ass nigga.  What you doing?  Doing Leno, nigga?  Pushing your face, fool.  Fuck wrong with you.  Well, there is an East Coast, West Coast comedy thing that happens, too, but it's not like the  rap thing.  No, it ain't.  But you guys do hate each other.  For some reason, man.  It's weird.  It's hilarious, man.  But it's pussy compared to the rappers, you know.  Can I ask you a question?  All of a sudden, I'm sorry.  Alan Light.  Big time writer.  One question.  Before you get into Alan Light.  Just one.  Hold on a minute.  We're not going to get into Alan Light. 
[02:16:30]  We're just going to hang.  You think we have an actual interview planned?  Oh, no?  I know better than that.  Your influences now, growing up.  Get it going.  I miss this, because I don't have one of those things to walk around with at home.  To listen to XM all the time?  Why doesn't he have one?  I don't know.  Why would he?  That would be good.  Why would they give up?  What is going on with you guys and Dice?  What is going on?  Dice.  Honest to God.  I have no idea.  Dice is just a disloyal, self-centered asshole.  Was this before the radio? 
[02:17:00]  Before he did the radio show on Sirius?  Well, he was friends with the show.  We helped him out a lot.  Got him back into Madison Square Garden after he was like, you know, nothing.  And when we were off the air, I guess we didn't really serve a purpose for him, plugging any gigs and stuff.  But Ope went out there, hung out with him.  They were friends.  And then we get back on the air here, try to get him back on the show.  One of those people we would have loved to have back on and rekindled the friendship on the air. 
[02:17:30]  For some reason, and there have been varying reasons, he didn't come on the show.  And then, lo and behold, he shows up on Stern, and his top priority on that show is just sitting there and bad-mouthing us,  who did nothing to him but, you know, treat him with the respect that he was not due.  If you know anything about Dice and the people that work for him, he does this to everybody.  He's a bridge-burner, like a madman.  The guy has no friends in show business because he treats everyone like shit.  He'd rather blow off the relationship we made with him that goes back a few years now to sell a few extra tickets for governors on Long Island. 
[02:18:00]  That's the reality of it.  When he was doing our show, we were getting into the Beacon Theater in Madison Square Garden.  And next thing you know, like, we did him wrong for some reason.  Yeah.  So, he's pathetic.  Did Pat Coop ever come on?  He was supposed to come on and...  I don't know what the hell's going on with that.  I think he made up with Howard, didn't he?  He's just...  He was on one of Howard's channels, I think.  All right.  Curiosity.  Been gone.  I haven't seen you in a while.  Honestly, it's sad, but there's no real surprise there. 
[02:18:30]  I knew when Dice started doing our show that it would probably end, like, weird.  Yeah.  Because it's just that type of guy.  Well, I can tell you, with another season of Web Junk and me and D.L. hanging out, you  guys still, in the mornings, I'll still stop through.  Thanks, man.  You ass.  Just stop through.  I was watching Web Junk and I see...  It's hard to forget where you came from when you're still right there.  When are you still...  Right across the street.  I could be... 
[02:19:00]  I'd be trying to be up an echelon and it just don't work.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  We said it show up at nine.  And you were here at 8.30.  You couldn't wait.  You couldn't wait to get in here.  Fucking pudding hat.  Coming in for my brand new...  Hello, everybody.  Put it in the face.  There you go.  All right.  I was watching Web Junk and I saw, like, your second, like, clip show thing that they did.  Like, the best of...  The best of...  How long has the show been on? 
[02:19:30]  You've done three best of...  It's a documentary.  It's a...  It's a...  We've done three best of shows.  I see Patrice going, welcome to volume three of the best of Web Junk.  That's why I'm like, the show just got on.  The reason I exist on that show is because they have to have a reason to show the clips.  Right.  That's the only reason I'm there.  They...  I have to go, hey, folks, this is why.  Yeah.  Oh, and the ones they show again are ones that they can show again. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  They can't just fucking frivolously show shit.  Unbelievable.  I'm hanging by a thread.  They had to go to, like, fucking...  You know, they had to go to a top secret place in, like, Alaska to go fish for, like,  a season's worth of new shit.  Yeah, new videos.  I love doing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.  You think that the well is going to run dry?  It's the shelf life.  Yeah.  Because they did a contest.  Come on, everybody.  Give us a video.  Send in, please.  Buncho, idiots, motherfuckers are just uncreative.  This country sucks.  Come on, give us a video. 
[02:20:30]  Everybody's pretending shooting this over the head and flying around, and it's like, oh,  you fucking stink.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I heard Dice's side.  He said that he's pissed that Opie flipped out the night at the garden about Man Cow coming  out to announce him, and he said that you cursed out.  You know, you were cursing and screaming in front of his little kids, and you disrespected  his kids, and he doesn't stand for that, and that was one of the big problems that he 
[02:21:00]  had with you.  Mike, there was a problem with Man Cow because, you know, Man Cow was invited to New York City,  Madison Square Garden for the Dice Show, okay?  Which, that right there is a huge problem.  We're arch enemies.  The guy's a fucking asshole.  And I don't even want to get into that part of it, okay?  And then Man Cow is on Fox and Friends announcing, because he knows it would get to us, and busting 
[02:21:30]  our balls saying that he's sponsoring Dice in New York City.  I'm presenting Dice over here at Madison Square Garden.  Shut up.  So, you know, obviously he could not be at the garden, and we explained that to Dice,  and we explained to it on air, got heated a little bit.  Here's what I would have to say.  If he had a problem that day, why didn't he bring it up with us?  We ended up having a relationship that lasted another two or three years after that thing,  after that garden show.  Why didn't he bring it up when it was hot?  You know, but he could have brought it up when I was in L.A. hanging out in his apartment 
[02:22:00]  after he got kicked out of his house, when we were hanging out at Gold's Gym lifting,  when we went and climbed the mountain, the stupid little molehill that he calls the mountain.  You want to climb the mountain?  He's full of shit because he says that he confronted you about it.  He called you out.  He said you want to go at it or whatever.  That's such a go at it.  And then he said, you know, you pussy didn't pound, didn't do nothing.  And then Anthony tried to intervene, and he said he put your ass down, you know, right there. 
[02:22:30]  See, that tells how much bullshit it is right there, because I don't get involved with anybody.  I was fucking drinking.  Obviously, he's bullshit about that part.  Mike.  But did you see what he looks like?  He looks like a mess.  His fucking head is receding back.  He's got an eight head.  I kind of feel sorry for him that he had to go down that road, but, you know.  He is starting to look like Nah, Rickles.  Hey, you hockey puck.  But it's all about the love, people.  He's wearing those fucking weightlifting gloves, like, what the fuck is this? 
[02:23:00]  Well, weightlifting gloves on stage.  That's great.  I might do comedy.  I might just work out.  You can watch me.  You know, Jacob.  You know what he says is really ridiculous that he made you guys popular in New York.  Yous were nothing until he started doing your show.  We did great radio with the guy, but we were very successful before Dice came aboard.  We don't have to defend that, and as far as this confrontation that I swear to you never 
[02:23:30]  happened, after the Garden Show, he grabbed me.  He's like, come on, and we walked in the middle of Madison Square Garden.  It was completely empty after the concert let out, and we're taking pictures together.  Can I kiss you on the mouth?  And he had tears in his eyes.  He goes, you don't understand how important this was to me that my kids were able to see  me at Madison Square Garden, because the first time I did it, they were either too young  or not even born.  I don't know exactly what he said about that, but they obviously weren't, you know, around  or big enough to appreciate it, and then we had a relationship that lasted easily two 
[02:24:00]  or three more years after that.  I was in, every time I went to L.A., I hung out with him in the comedy store and all that  shit.  Remember, he wanted to help you decorate.  Yeah, you know what?  He's bullshit, because he says, from day one, he thought you were an asshole when he made  you guys when he came in the studio.  You know, it's so easy.  Dude, Mike, it's so easy to say Opie's an asshole, but you know what?  He knows that's not true.  He sent flowers to my dad's wake.  You know, I mean, the guy's ridiculous.  I don't know why he decided to turn. 
[02:24:30]  I guess he's desperate to get his name back up there and attempt to get back on top, because  all he was doing on Howard was trashing us to sell a few extra tickets at Governor's.  That's pathetic to me.  Well, I think he's just, he's trashing you guys because he knows Howard hates you, and  I think he's just trying to piss Howard's ass now to, you know, to be back on his show,  you know, and, you know, get on his good side.  We were in his apartment in L.A.  We went to the grocery store, and everyone was recognizing him after we went to, you know, 
[02:25:00]  Gold's Gym.  I was out there for a while, so I hung out with him all day, and then we're at his apartment.  He's making, like, it's pretty funny, actually.  He's making, like, chicken stir-fry for me and stuff, and then we're sitting around talking  about his family, his kids, and he's showing me, like, videotape of this reality project  that he was doing at the time, which honestly was really good, but no one picked it up,  but it was really, really entertaining and fun.  Because he's burnt every bridge.  And he was asking me, you know, what I thought of it and all that stuff.  All that stuff.  What do you think?  So.  Huh?  You're here. 
[02:25:30]  So I.  All right, guys, punch it out.  I honestly don't know why he turned, but he did, and, you know, good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  It's like a mad dog.  He just turned, and we shot him in the head.  He's done.  Dead to us.  Dead.  What are we plugging today?  I guess I'm still plugging the book.  I don't know, you know.  Story of the Beastie Boys.  The skills to pay the bills.  Story of the Beastie Boys.  And we got into this last time.  You don't watch American Idol?  I don't watch American Idol.  I got too much going on.  They were doing this whole queen.  Too much going on. 
[02:26:00]  Thanks.  Make us sound like we got nothing going on.  But you're a music guy.  You got no DVR?  I'm a music guy.  I don't think you've got anything to do.  You might be able to write something about it.  Hard to look at American Idol as a music story.  We don't think there's one freak on the fluke chance that one person might actually be talented on that show.  If one person's good, we'll find out about them, you know, one way or another.  They're all getting a shot.  Not a big Clay Aiken fan, are you?  Yeah, look, I can't.  It is, you know, it is what it is.  It's a contest.  Clay Aiken's going to be a footnote in music. 
[02:26:30]  I don't think so, man.  Ruben's going to be a footnote.  Ruben.  Ruben is.  And the black ones are.  Why is that?  Because it's a black-white thing.  It's always a black-white thing.  Well, hey, we won't make it one.  Hey, you know what?  Everybody's going to do good, you motherfuckers.  It don't exist.  Try to make me Mr. Black and White, but I'm just telling you, Ruben's in deep shit.  Clay Aiken was out.  He was doing what he was.  Listen, motherfuckers, the show is fucking rigged so that you can't, black people can't 
[02:27:00]  really succeed on the fucking show.  Really?  It's despicable.  Come on.  But how do they win and then not?  First of all, how the fuck do you have, what's her name, Priceless?  Oh, Mandisa?  No, that bitch, come on, you know that.  As a white man, you got to watch that shit go.  That was fucked up.  That was fucked up, but I think that's because you split the black vote.  I think you had to, you know, you got...  There is no black vote.  You got the little kid, Paris.  That's why they looked like a whore last night.  Yeah, just like a little whore. 
[02:27:30]  She looked like a fucking white groupie from a...  She looked like...  From Twisted System.  She looked like she was 37 years old last night.  They got her confused.  Yeah.  But why would you have people sing shit that they wouldn't want to ever fucking sing?  Right.  And why wouldn't you have people vote for the worst performer?  Yeah.  Not the best, because if the best...  You're always going to have more white people fucking voting.  There's more white people.  So they're going to vote for the best.  They're going to vote for who they want to... 
[02:28:00]  Would you like us to move somewhere?  No, I'm just saying...  Maybe leave the country.  Vote for the worst, so that Mandisa would never be in the fucking bottom three.  Right?  You don't think you're on the show.  I got no fight with the show.  I agree with you.  Hey, Reuben, I mean, look, in this country...  Because he was a faggot.  You're only...  No one notices skin color in this country.  Because Clay Aiken...  Clay Aiken's a sissy.  Yeah.  That's why this country's more comfortable with blacks than they are with sissies.  I find that hard to believe.  Yeah.  You know?  I just think that they are. 
[02:28:30]  Sissies never take your car and drive away with it.  Bring it back all clean.  I never had a fucking gang of sissies chase me into traffic and fucking...  Oh, yes, you have.  They just would dress like women.  One took my glasses.  And that's the glasses off your head, yo.  For wasting my time.  I'm just saying, I watch it.  Oh, I watch the fucking show, man.  Is that all pudding on the ceiling?  That they're putting at?  What is that?  It's a big Sierra pudding on the ceiling dial.  You're right. 
[02:29:00]  That's pudding?  Yeah.  Holy mackerel.  Remember that old joke?  I'm just wondering how he got his asshole up that high.  I guess you don't...  But the Queen stuff last night was just a complete waste of time.  It was sad.  No one's going to be able to sing like Freddie Mercury ever.  Unless you kick yourself in the balls before you hit the stage.  Can you tell me why they do that, please?  Can you tell me why they have you sing in fucking genres?  No one has to sing in a genre when you're trying to make it.  I know.  If they do a comedy competition, you don't go, all right, we're going to do George Carlin stuff today. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, and they're going to bring out props.  Now, you've got to do some prop comedy, Patrice.  We're going to give you a trunk with some stuff.  This is exactly what it would be.  We're going to give you a trunk, and Gallagher's going to come out,  and he's going to help you and coach you on how to do prop comedy.  Get the fuck out of here.  That would be fun, actually.  No, stupid.  Take the hammer and put it over your head.  You don't do the over the shoulder.  Have you ever seen me do over the shoulder?  I'd hit him in the head so hard.  You see what Kenny Rogers, and I know you must have talked about it, 
[02:30:00]  but Kenny Rogers with his makeover saying, you know, man,  Deese is like, you know, singing fat bitch songs, you know what I mean?  What you want?  And she's like, he's like, pronounce the L's on the country, the story.  I'm like, you fucking, you fucking up these people's minds.  You fucking up their minds.  Look at, and your boy got to go.  I was in Alabama last week.  Bucky.  No, Ace.  Chris Autry.  Retard.  Kevin.  Thank you very much.  Kevin.  Take Me Home. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know the name.  Taylor Hicks.  He's got to go.  Taylor ain't going anywhere.  Taylor ain't going nowhere.  He sucks.  He's going to be in the bottom.  If he's not in the bottom three, I'm going to boycott the show.  I don't agree with you.  I mean, I do agree with you, but I don't think he's going anywhere.  The American people love shit like that.  They're going to sit there and go, God damn, he's funny.  They're going to get rid of Ace.  He's goddamn funny.  They're going to get rid of Ace and Elliot before Taylor Hicks goes.  Ace has to go.  Even though Elliot's probably a much better singer.  And I feel bad for Ace because you know he's out of here because he's been in the bottom three for a while. 
[02:31:00]  But who makes We Will Rock You their own?  Yeah, I know.  How the fuck do you un-karaoke?  It's a karaoke song to begin with.  Right.  He had balls, too, because he goes to Brian May.  I want to change the arrangement of the song.  And Brian May, what?  I ain't changing the song.  I'm not changing anything.  And it's like, first of all, Mr. May, you ain't shit without that sissy Freddie Mercury.  Let's be honest.  He had a very distinctive guitar sound, Patrice. 
[02:31:30]  And then when George Michael stepped in, it was fine.  And then Paris looking like she's 37 now with those hair extensions.  What was that about?  How did she go from, oh my God, she can't lose, to poor baby?  Thank you, Sammy.  And Kelly Pickler is completely faking this.  She's playing this stupid angle.  Well, she said, you know, on paper, it looks good.  Paper?  And then she goes, what is on paper?  You're not that stupid.  You can't possibly be. 
[02:32:00]  She's got a little stupid in her, and someone said, the stupid thing is working.  I would continue with that.  That's all that's about.  Yeah.  You don't know what on paper means?  Work the stupid angle it's working for you.  See, but this is why this is not a music.  I mean, that's the thing.  Like, no, everything they've achieved is amazing, but it's all, you know.  But now you get somebody like.  Who looks like what?  Who's the, how do you play the voters?  How are you doing?  That's cool.  That's TV, and they're killing everybody.  But isn't that what music is about, the image that the person has?  There could be some of the best singers in the world, you know, farming somewhere in 
[02:32:30]  Nebraska, and they'll never get the chance to show themselves.  And it is about personality, how you present yourself, how you look, how you act on stage,  if you can relate with a crowd.  Like, that guy, Chris, is really a great singer.  This guy's voice is amazing.  Which one's that, the rocker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he has a thing where, like, a guy like that, you would hope he quits.  Just leave the show and sign with somebody.  He has a thing where he just seems professional.  He has a movement like he's a pro, you know.  American Idol's protected against that these days. 
[02:33:00]  I bet you can't quit the show at all.  They've already signed.  And I think once you get to the top 20, they all have to sign exclusive deals.  One of the seasons, someone did quit because they knew they were better off if they quit.  Yeah.  Who was that?  Exactly.  No, you're right.  Was that the guy that was banging Paul Abdul?  No.  There was another Puerto Rican K with a cat.  And then the different guy from New York.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  We got to say, we can't let a big star wait.  Dennis Leary.  Hey, guys.  How are you, buddy?  I'm all right.  How you doing?  Good.  I was just, it's Opie talking.  I was just on vacation, and I got to admit, I'm the last person to see Ice Age. 
[02:33:30]  I finally saw it in the original.  Get out of here.  You're not the last person.  There's plenty of people out there that need to go to see this movie.  No, no, no.  He's talking about the first one.  I'm talking about $120 million.  Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.  I know there's more money.  Dennis, you're not listening.  I'm talking about the first one.  The first one he didn't see.  Oh, the first one.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  And you know how many times you've come in, and I make believe I saw it?  You liar.  You low-down, dirty liar.  I got to tell you, though, man, that movie was great. 
[02:34:00]  Let me tell you something.  The second one's even funnier.  Yeah?  Let me tell you something else.  The third one?  Jesus is dead.  It's going to be great.  You don't need to celebrate Easter, okay?  Ice Age is alive, all right?  Go there.  Go see Ice Age.  Actually, Jesus is in Ice Age.  If you go to Ice Age 2, it counts as going to Mass if you're a Catholic.  How easy a gig is that?  You go to see the movie, and you celebrate Easter at the same time.  I'll tell you how popular the new Ice Age movie is.  It's making Dennis so big that he doesn't need to come in here anymore.  Now he just gives us a call. 
[02:34:30]  A little phone-er.  You know what, guys?  I apologize for that.  I'm just in the middle of this goddamn giant press tour, and I obviously would love to be  in the studio with you guys because I always have a good time there.  And I'm good at predicting the future.  Ice Age 3 comes out.  You forgot who we were.  Ice Age 3 comes out.  I basically retire.  If you make as much money as this one, I'm done.  I saw you in the paper the other day in your little fireman suit.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[02:35:00]  When does Rescue Me start back up?  May 30th.  Season 3 starts.  We're shooting it right now.  The second week in May, the second season DVD comes out.  The third week in May, the Rescue Me soundtrack comes out.  Any black characters, Dennis?  Oh, yeah.  Any black characters?  Yes, people after the fire.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Is that Jim Norton?  Of course it is.  And Patrice O'Neill.  I was just wondering, Dennis.  Hey, man.  How you doing, man?  Two funny sons of bitches.  I mean, you throw me in a lot of stuff, but, you know, that Rescue Me, boy.  Yeah.  Boy, that would be a feather in my cap. 
[02:35:30]  That's a nice one, right?  Man, oh, man.  You can tell VH want to go screw themselves with their dumb web junk.  Web junk my dick.  With a little rescue me.  Patrice, I got to tell you, man, I watch that show with my kids all the time.  And we laugh our asses off.  What's your favorite clip?  My favorite clip, so, oh, man, that would be a hard thing to pick.  But, oh, man.  I would have to say the, uh...  He's on the website right now.  Hyping like a motherfucker.  He just smacked his son in the head. 
[02:36:00]  Go get the fucking...  There's so many funny fucking clips.  In his head, it's hummina, hummina, hummina.  You can see them at ogres.com.  That's, um, that's with the, uh, yeah, the Chinese kid.  Oh, good, good.  Yeah, I mean...  All right.  That's safe to say Chinese kid.  They find the clips, and then you just go in, and you kind of talk off the top of your head?  No, I don't, um, I, I, I talk a little bit off the top of my head.  A lot off the top of my head, but...  Yeah.  Eventually, that shit will, you'll die. 
[02:36:30]  What, you'll run out?  Yeah.  So they'll go, hey, man, how about this angle?  You know, it's a, you know.  The little Chinese kid, or whatever he was, talking with the little actress girl was really funny.  How much are you going to do it?  Like, once a week to do it?  Twice.  Eight, I think 16 hours.  Dakota Fanning.  16 hours a week?  Yeah.  Just, you know.  Really?  Working harder than us a week.  Jesus, what are you doing?  Well, I have to fucking, you, because you, you say so much stuff.  You go, here's this thing, look at this funny guy.  Like, I say something that I think is a gem.  I go, oh, look at that little gook just fall down.  And I say, beat gook, you know, and they go, ah, you can't beat gook. 
[02:37:00]  You can't just, you can't, you can't say gook.  Fuck.  You can say that.  Ah, no, you can't.  They won't allow it.  You know, look at these chigs abusing women.  Because that's all they do to fucking shake.  That's what they, they put, like, a piece of meat on 16 bitches' heads.  How about the woman with the ass?  The Chinese lady with the ass thing?  Oh, breaking the nuts or something, right?  Oh, my God.  Cracking the nuts open it.  What the hell is that about?  I don't know.  She was European.  How do you discover that talent?  You know what I mean?  You know, I think Dennis is telling me that my future lies in WebJunk 20. 
[02:37:30]  Fuck.  I don't think he's letting me on.  I don't think firemen is in my future.  Rescue me.  When's the last time you saw a black New York fireman?  It's a stepping stone to the Patrice O'Neill empire that will occur at some point in the future, ladies and gentlemen.  You're a little fraternity.  You might be a little racist there.  Yeah, I think the Patrice O'Neill channel is in the future where you just wake up and we have Patrice O'Neill 24 hours a day.  If I had the lifespan of a white guy, I would agree with you.  But it's got to happen soon.  I am Mabel O'Neill. 
[02:38:00]  I'm fucking Ronnie Dejafield's age.  In white years.  In white years, nigga.  Jesus Christ.  Shit, man.  I can't.  I can't.  You know how many people ask Dennis to be on that show, though?  It doesn't matter.  You can't imagine.  He doesn't give a shit about the other people asking.  I have a history with the...  I have a history with the...  I forgot the company.  Fucking Serpico and them. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Dennis to come.  Apostle.  Apostle.  Got a history with Apostle.  So, you know, I'm fucking around, really, because they hook me up.  They're the first people that ever just put me on shit.  You know what I mean?  People just put you in stuff.  We have a history with Apostle, too.  You don't see us being suicide guy from the roof saying, don't jump, don't jump on the  show.  Yeah.  You do have a history with Apostle?  Yeah, we've done a few meetings with Apostle.  I've said this before, and I'll say it again.  Yes, man.  This is one of the funniest motherfuckers that has ever walked this planet. 
[02:39:00]  They don't...  I don't...  No bullshit.  This motherfucker.  No bullshit.  I wrote...  Did you ever get that letter I wrote?  Yeah, man.  It was a nice letter.  It was in...  Ireland.  He took me to Ireland.  10,000.  I played the most people I've ever been in front of.  And then, uh, the last, um, Boston, the, um, Comics Come Home was the second highest.  Avery Fisher Hall.  It...  Which was that?  No.  That was in New York.  Oh, shit.  That was huge.  Lincoln Center?  Fucking, uh...  Isn't that ironic?  It's the Lincoln Center.  I'm thinking of Boston.  Massachusetts.  Lincoln Center. 
[02:39:30]  Uh, Carnegie Hall.  Carnegie Hall.  A lot of big shit, man.  They hooked me up with a lot.  Like, you don't...  And you don't even think about it, because he just...  Because Dennis never talks to me.  It's always, um...  It's just Apostle.  Yeah.  But it's coming from Dennis.  He's the Don.  Dennis is one of those guys, you know...  He gets his capos to talk to you.  He don't want to talk to you too much.  He just goes, hey, man, you're a funny guy.  Thanks, Dennis.  And he just goes, get out of my fucking face.  You can feel it.  You can feel his energy.  I took Patrice to Ireland.  We did the biggest gig in, uh, a comedy gig in European history.  It was 10,000 people, right? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, it was amazing, dude.  Jesus Christ.  This motherfucker goes on stage, and he opens up with a bit, which was true.  Because he'd been there many times before.  He opens up with 10 minutes about how Ireland, because they're becoming an economic booming  country, has discovered its own form of racism.  And he fucking slays the room with it.  That's what I love about him.  He comes on stage in Boston in front of 8,000 people wearing a fucking Yankees hat.  Oh, yeah.  What a set of fucking balls.  He does five minutes about how black people wear a Yankees hat, because it matches their  socks. 
[02:40:30]  He's wearing his A's gear today, because that's the latest thing.  Can't name one player on the team, but he likes the green.  Dennis, head to toe with Oakland A's stuff on.  You know what?  Hey, man, like you said, black people wear it because it's a fashion statement.  White people wear it because it's my team, man.  Well, yeah.  Fucking white idiots are out there with the Yankees hats on, even though they got a shirt  that doesn't match the hat.  Yeah.  Not many people with the B hats on, though.  That's good that you take care of comedians, though, certain ones, you know? 
[02:41:00]  No, but he's more East Coast.  Doesn't, um, yeah, I wasn't carrying on new tours, you know?  He's talking about himself there, Patrice.  Jim and Norm.  I know he's talking about himself, but I'm East Coast, too.  Jim's a West Coast guy now.  Now he is.  Yeah, you're right.  He's sneaky West Coast.  He's packing his shit.  Oh, yeah.  Jim's packing his shit.  Once that series comes out.  I'm actually going to leave a minute to catch a plane to the coast.  It's funny.  Yeah, dude.  See?  Hey, guys, I got to roll because I got a bunch of press to do, but...  But I thought we were having fun.  They're telling us you got to go, Dennis.  When I do, when Rescue Me comes out, I'll come over. 
[02:41:30]  I'll bring some of the guys.  I'll come over to the studio.  I'll bring Lenny.  You do that.  We love Lenny.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Dennis.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for the quick call, Dennis.  Bye.  Dennis Lurie, everyone.  Go see Ice Age.  See?  I want a graph.  I want a graph of Dennis's appearances on this program based on time and in-studio and  phoner.  Who's the biggest star that still fucks with you guys?  We'll watch it go down like Citadel stock.  I think you.  Who's the biggest star? 
[02:42:00]  Seriously.  Who's the biggest star that still just fucking calls in or comes in or whatever?  It's got to be Dennis Lurie.  Think about it.  I would think Dennis...  As a regular guy?  Dennis Lurie.  Right up there.  I bet you that's the last time he...  Yeah, you just heard the last time Dennis has been on the Opie and Anthony show.  The second Ice Age movie's blown up, Rescue Me.  Is he the producer or something?  What?  Is he the producer, by the way?  I'm sure he got a great...  Those cartoons are a fortune for the voice people and it's no work. 
[02:42:30]  I would love to just stay and...  I'd quit comedy if I could just do voiceovers.  Would that be great?  It's the greatest...  Hey, what do you say we go down the valley and try to go this way?  Hire me, please.  What's wrong with that?  Why is that any different from anything else?  And reading it.  Yeah.  Reading.  It's reading.  Do you know how fucking lazy I was?  Movies on the big screen.  Just reading is fucking voiceover.  If somebody tells you voiceover work is... 
[02:43:00]  I used to do voiceover something that used to come on Noggin.  I forgot Noggin.  Noggin.  That's our little kiddie channel.  Yes!  If they knew who I was...  I know.  Oh, Grady High.  I used to lay on the floor in the fucking booth.  I used to lay on the floor and set up my paperwork and lay like with my hand on my...  And read the fucking...  Because it was that easy.  I was afraid of that.  Someone tells me there wasn't a lot of Noggin money, though, going around.  Well, no, but it was...  If you were being paid a lot, you're coming in a suit. 
[02:43:30]  Yes, I'm here to do my voiceover work.  Once you get to hang...  Really, what amount of money would make you change who you were?  Like, if somebody said, here's a billion...  Throw me out a number.  You would...  A billion dollars.  You'd still be Anthony.  Hey, this is why...  You'd never notice it, though.  Who came up with this?  I'm going to change it a second.  I'm a sellout motherfucker.  I got to...  E-Rock.  Change it back to Dennis for a second.  E-Rock did a little research, okay?  Dennis Leary has done our show three times.  Probably three times since we've been on XM. 
[02:44:00]  And he did it a few times at the old joint.  Okay.  First time he was on was June 28th, 05.  Okay.  He was on for 45 minutes.  45 minutes.  Oh, shit.  Second time...  Live in studio?  Live in studio.  All right.  Second time, 11.30, 05.  He was on for a little over an hour.  So we ought to bump up, okay?  Uh-huh.  Now, since that last appearance, let's remember, Ice Age blew up, obviously.  The second movie is now out and Rescue Me. 
[02:44:30]  Today, he was on for eight minutes.  Eight minutes by phone.  That's a mistake, though.  That's extenuating circumstances.  You got to give him one more chance.  One more chance?  For a half hour.  Okay.  One more.  I want to see the letter you wrote to Dennis.  Oh, it was heartwarming.  And where's our letter?  Yeah.  We've done some things for you.  Well, you know, I'm not done yet with you guys.  Where are you fucking motherfuckers?  That was a fucking, I want a letter.  I'll see you again letter.  That was a pretty much, thank you, goodbye.  Patrice is going to feel real good and finally write that letter, thinking that we're going 
[02:45:00]  to take it seriously.  And it'll be right up on openatnight.com.  Look what Patrice wrote us.  Whack bag.  Patrice is a faggot.  But I've left faggot messages for Opie.  I don't have your number.  How do you not have my number?  I just think it's just useless to call you.  It's useless to call Opie, but it's probably more double useless to call you.  I got to tell you, Patrice O'Neal is very appreciative.  Let me tell you, I'm a fun call, by the way. 
[02:45:30]  I'm also helpful.  I can imagine calling, hey, Anthony, what's up, man?  Who's this?  It's Patrice, what's going on?  I would know just because I'd hear it was a black guy.  I'd know it's you because I don't know any other black people.  I feel like Anthony would go, it'll be uncomfortable sounds and then like a, what's up, dude?  What's going on?  Oh, hey, Patrice, what's up?  And then you hear in the background like I'm just going about my business playing video  game.  You hear pew, pew, pew. 
[02:46:00]  I was on one day on Pound Talk, he was giving a fucking tour of your home.  That was my new thing, so I was showing all the boxes.  I was like, this motherfucker, if I called him, but I'd call Opie, I'd call Opie, I left  him a lot of messages, like after the Black Phillip show, I was like, man.  That tells you something right there.  You said I've left him a lot of messages.  No, no, we've talked a lot.  You'll get back.  Wait a minute, Patrice, help me out here.  I call you back a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because Opie never really, 90% of the time, the phone won't pick up.  But I'm very, like, I don't want to be the motherfucker bothering people, so I'll only 
[02:46:30]  call once.  So I can't really say you're going to get back.  And I have a message that says, listen, I'll try to get back to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably not going to happen.  But I don't take it personal, you know what I mean, when people tell you back.  We do have to take a break because we got Alan Light here.  And also, remember, we started the show with that intern Tommy?  Who?  The Stephen Wright guy?  Oh, right.  So Thang got some Stephen Wright jokes together for him.  And we'll see.  I hope he didn't wake up. 
[02:47:00]  I'll see you guys in Boston because I have to leave.  I've got to catch a flight.  You mother.  You know how it is for shooting.  Got to go.  But Jimmy.  Jimmy.  No, I miss my friends.  Where are you going?  L.A.?  L.A.  And when is your flight?  1.15.  1.15.  It's only 10.  I have an 11.15 pickup.  So I'll go home.  11.15.  Yeah.  You're all packed?  95 percent, yeah.  I've got to put my no stuff in a couple of things.  So you're going to fly to Boston to do our show?  No, I'm going to fly back into New York and go up with you.  I'm driving you up?  I may.  Well, I think they may give me the room in the day early because I may have to fly in. 
[02:47:30]  I might leave.  First class?  I might leave Friday, though.  First class?  My first class.  I would laugh at NBC if they fly there.  If they try to fly in the coach.  Do you have your gold status or platinum?  Gold.  Oh.  Platinum.  Yeah, platinum status.  All right.  Maybe I will fly in Friday, though.  I'll see if I can switch the flight to go through Houston.  I'm just warning you.  I might go up Friday.  I'm not even kidding.  Maybe I'll have Donnie get me in the room. 
[02:48:00]  I'll tell Donnie to put the suite and I'll just switch the flight and I'll fly right in  from the coast.  Get the hell out of here.  You'll fly right into Boston?  I'll fly it in the coast.  I'll take a quick connection.  Just make sure the suite's set up in the car.  That's all.  I'm ready to go.  Oh, I know.  I won't have enough clothes.  Fuck.  Speaking of people leaving the show.  Just go buy some.  Just go buy some at the mall.  Have them close.  Have them close the store down.  Yeah.  I'll have Kenny.  Tell him I'm coming.  Close the store down and get me a few other.  Close the Macy's.  Could you close the store?  Mr. Norton would like to...  Who?  Who?  Opium ant.  Two guys from... 
[02:48:30]  I'm the cop that got in trouble.  Oh, you.  Okay.  It was funny watching Kenny explain that and the more details you have to give, the less  you know somebody recognizes you.  Yeah.  You know, from New Jersey.  You know, I told dirty jokes.  You know...  No one knows you still.  No one knows.  You're not Lenny Bruce.  Dude, I've done that exact thing with our St. Pat's.  Yeah.  You know...  They either know right away or they have no clue.  Or they don't.  And you're like, why am I explaining this?  They don't know.  Kenny's the only cop who had a mullet. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, I know you.  Yeah, that is the...  You know, the guy with the mullet.  The mullet and the tapering head.  Yes.  I'm going to leak myself.  Stupid cop mustache.  Jim Norton, have fun in L.A.  We'll see you in Boston when we broadcast live.  Monday, I think, we're broadcasting live from Boston.  Bill's Bar, is it?  Marathon Monday.  I don't even know.  Lansdowne Street.  Sounds good.  Are you really going up Friday?  Maybe.  I didn't know that.  All right, I'll try to wait for you.  Wow, you're going to my hometown.  Holy shit.  Why don't you come with us?  Tell everybody to say hi.  You should.  You should come up to Boston, man.  I miss my mom.  Come up at all of us. 
[02:49:30]  Nice to visit my mommy.  Can I...  Can someone point to Derek?  Oh, point.  If my plane doesn't crash.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys.  And I patched up the wounds with Wow Stickers.  But, but dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers at opieandanthony.com. 
[02:50:00]  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee-dance.  Pee-dance.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Now, I fanned you before, motherfuckers.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  You are so banned, you stupid cocksucker.  You are so banned.  Anthony's in a mood today.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  He's gonna do the rest of the week with us, and we couldn't be happier.  Alan Light in studio. 
[02:50:30]  Stones playing behind us.  They censored the Stones in China.  They finally, they finally got there and finally got the show.  I think they knew there were gonna be some limitations going in.  Yeah, because they're making a big deal, because it's censorship, obviously.  But you gotta think, if you're gonna play China, that you're not gonna...  Yeah, that was not a surprise.  You're not gonna be able to.  Hey, they censored them on the Super Bowl, so, you know.  That was, that was so ridiculous.  You don't have to go to China to get censored.  So they, uh, they couldn't play, what, four or five songs over there?  Yeah, something like that.  I mean, they were gonna go a few years ago. 
[02:51:00]  I don't know.  It was, uh, one of the new songs and a couple of the old songs.  Ah, okay.  I forget which ones.  Yeah, I don't remember the rest.  Like, it matters, and like, Mick Jagger cared.  Well, he did back, way back in the Ed Sullivan days.  He cared.  What's the matter?  Are you saying maybe he doesn't have the same passion for it, and it's all about the cash?  No, it's China.  I think it's just a huge accomplishment just to be able to say, wow, we play China.  Yeah.  Who would have thought that would have ever happened, right?  Right.  And they could do most of the set.  They could do the, you know. 
[02:51:30]  You've got a catalog that's 10,000 songs big, so they couldn't play four or five.  I don't think Mick Jagger, who, yeah, he's all for that.  I'd like to know which ones, though, and why the government felt them.  God, bring Ben in.  Ben knows.  Ben!  Ben knows.  I should know.  It's wrong that I don't know.  He's keeping it under his hat, though, with a cement mixer.  Come on, Ben.  Where are you?  He was just in here.  Ben.  Ben.  Here, Ben.  Ben.  Come on, boy.  What's wrong with, Patrice? 
[02:52:00]  Come on, boy.  Come on, Ben.  What's wrong, Patrice?  Come here, Ben.  Come on, Ben.  He's so fucked up.  Dude, the worst part about it.  Come on, Ben.  Good boy, Ben.  Come here, Ben.  Be good boy.  The worst part about it, we're struggling a little bit here on the air.  I just saw him way in the background.  I know.  The worst part about it, just puts up a finger like one minute.  One minute.  All right, we'll sweat for another minute here live on the air.  Here he comes.  Good boy.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  What's wrong with Ike and the Brown Sugar?  What's wrong with Earl?  Oh, you're true?  I thought you knew the songs off the top of your head.  Oh, Earl's here?  Yeah.  Then bring Earl in.  Earl would absolutely know.  Come on, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  I know Satisfaction is one.  It was like five of them.  Earl, what songs...  Earl, we need to know what songs were banned in China.  I think it was Let's Spend the Night Together, Brown Sugar, Rough Justice.  Rough Justice was definitely one of them, yeah.  Wow.  Why Brown Sugar? 
[02:53:00]  The song's about screwing on a slave shit.  It's about sex and the slave trade.  Yeah, but why do the Chinese have a problem with that?  They have...  Is that what the fuck it's about?  Can I...  I didn't know either.  Oh, we're educating people.  Hold on.  Can I raise my hand?  I'm going to raise my hand, too, and everyone else.  I had no idea.  And I've been playing that song on the radio my entire life.  This is why hooks are so important.  Tell that to America.  He pulls a black knotty head, fucks it on the edge of the bone, and shoots the cannon off 
[02:53:30]  in a black pussy.  Brown Sugar!  We're going to sell the bitch for a dime.  Brown Sugar!  Brown!  Brown!  Brown!  That means a brown, black pussy head.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I had no idea.  Go back and listen, kids.  Yep.  Dude, where does it...  Where does it say like that?  I think the opening on that it's sold on a slave on a cotton field.  Sold in the market down in New Orleans.  Yeah, but I think that she's there already, right?  Oh, my God.  I swear to God, I've been playing this song my entire life. 
[02:54:00]  I've been listening to a slave song.  Ain't she there already?  Hold on.  I want to hear the...  Black girl should.  All right, hold on.  Let's hear the lyrics now.  I can't believe this is news.  35 years later.  35 years this song came out.  Did you know this?  I suppose she was a slave, but I didn't know that...  She?  Oh, I know it.  Brown Sugar!  Did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did,  do, did, did, did, did, did, did did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, sorry, hey, David.  Bound for a cotton.  Hold on. 
[02:54:30]  Pause that.  Mick Jagger wasn't brave enough to sell that lyric, though, man.  That's the first time I've heard it that way.  What?  He kind of...  Bound for a cottonfield.  Bound for a cottonfield.  Yeah, but...  So she's on her way.  She's bound for a cotton.  But...  Sold in the market down in New Orleans.  Sold in the market down in New Orleans.  But he didn't really pronounce it that well.  Yeah.  Because this was what?  This came out in the 70s.  1971.  71.  Okay, so.  I don't know.  35 years and we're still listening.  Listen in again. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, come on.  Glad to hear.  Oh, here and whip the women just around midnight.  I had no idea.  I'm such an idiot.  Patrice is going to fall.  Look at that look.  Slave song?  No. 
[02:55:30]  A young girl should?  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  He's whipping her and then she's dancing like a young girl should.  What should happen?  He got her to behave.  Can we fucking dissect this song, please?  I understand what's going on.  All right, now that.  Call them lyrics up.  Call them lyrics up.  The plantation guy's wife is like on to wonder where it's going to stop.  They ain't stopping. 
[02:56:00]  He's fucking her.  He's fucking all the slave girls.  He likes the brown sugar.  Because he could.  Was this boycotting at some point?  I don't think so.  Did anybody notice this?  I don't think black people know this shit.  No.  Right now.  Ixnay.  Let's not.  Wow.  I don't think the black people know this.  They can't.  They can't notice.  This should be a fucking album.  God.  Wow. 
[02:56:30]  Who knew?  We're trying to get the lyrics.  I had no idea.  And what was that?  That saxophone solo was the fucking?  Yeah.  That was some sexy fucking going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields.  Sold in the markdown in New Orleans.  Scared old slaver knows he's doing all right.  Hear him whip the women just around with midnight.  Brown sugar.  How come you taste so good?  Brown sugar.  Just like a young girl should.  Yeah.  Drums beating cold.  English blood runs hot. 
[02:57:00]  Lady of the house wondering when it's going to stop.  House boy knows that he's doing all right.  You should have heard him just around midnight.  Brown sugar tastes so good.  I bet your mama was a tent show queen.  Black pussy.  How do you taste so good?  Tent show.  Mm-hmm.  Just like a black girl should.  My God.  Motherfucker.  I'm going to punch him right in his long tongue.  Holy jeez.  I bet your mama was a Cajun queen and all her boyfriends were sweet 16.  I'm no schoolboy, but I know what I like.  You should have heard them just around midnight.  Just fucking black girls. 
[02:57:30]  Just like a black girl should.  See, then they called him out on some girls.  Just like a black girl should.  Yes, that's true.  You know what?  I appreciate these fucking chinks.  I don't have a ban on that.  Ban that cocksucker.  Son of a bitch.  How did he get away with that shit?  I don't know.  It's back in the day.  Back in the day.  I'm going to make a song.  It was all just fun back in the day.  Make a song about white women getting raped.  Just think of a good hook. 
[02:58:00]  Cotton swabbing.  Wait.  My little Q-tip.  Q-tip.  Q-tip.  It's got a, yes.  Patrice attempting a follow-up hit.  I think so.  A follow-up.  It's raining stuff.  My little Q-tip.  The answer record.  She's parking a minivan to go shopping.  I'm putting this in my pocket.  Uh-oh.  He's bringing that to the community.  This is one of the best kept white secrets ever.  And he's now got a copy of The Plan.  Oh, damn.  I'm sitting there going, what the fuck are these Chinese people yapping about? 
[02:58:30]  Brown sugar.  What?  They don't have any sweeteners over there?  What's that all about?  They only like white sugar?  Mm.  Wow.  I had no idea.  Wow.  I am stunned.  This is, again, 1971.  We don't pancast that closely to music.  That's your job, Alan.  He's sung it eight million times.  How many times have you heard this song?  Heard.  I play it on the radio easily two to three thousand times.  Even read it.  It's hard to understand.  You know what's worse?  Yeah, well.  Well, Kajagoogoo's Too Shy is about the Holocaust. 
[02:59:00]  And I never knew it.  Shy, shy.  Hush, hush.  Oh, yeah.  Hush, hush.  It's when the gas comes.  Horrible.  I don't hear nothing about Jew.  Please don't believe me.  Please don't believe me, Patrice.  You could have gotten all the way with that.  I could have kept it rolling.  The filth and despicable shit that would have had to pour from my mouth to do it.  Oh, damn.  99 Luftballons.  The Hindenburg disaster.  Look where we started. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Rashad.  Hey, fellas.  What's up, man?  Look, I'm a black guy, and I love rock music.  I can listen to Pantera, Alice in Chains, Niners Nails.  I have not a clue of what they're saying.  It's a guitar riff, loop, and I'm happy.  No idea what they're saying.  You guys are all just humming along.  There's your American Idol.  There's the lesson for American Idol, I think.  What do you call it?  I lost it.  Not the riff, but the hook.  The hook.  Yeah.  I'm not do-do-do-do-do. 
[03:00:00]  A valentine from New Orleans.  New Orleans.  That's where music comes from.  Little black nigglet.  Did he just say nigglet?  I don't know what he said.  Brown sugar.  I love fucking in the ass.  He's a fucking motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  The words are put together in a way that it sounds like one big word.  Absolutely.  So you really don't realize what he's saying there in the first thing.  Lesson number one.  Go, go, go.  What? 
[03:00:30]  Shabam Fakata feel?  Motherfucker.  Shabam Fakata feel.  Rojoa should be as clever.  What are the motherfuckers?  What's the Rojoa?  The white motherfuckers.  They should just be clever.  They can sing all the fucking songs they want.  Sing any racist stuff you want as long as you make it string it out into one word.  Can you?  Did you know it was a fucking slave girl, dude?  I had no idea.  No clue.  Rashad, thanks for the call.  I thought it was just about, I knew it was about banging black chicks.  That's all I knew.  Brown sugar. 
[03:01:00]  I figure he likes the brown sugar.  I had no clue.  He's beating them.  They're dancing.  Making them dance.  I didn't even know the hook was about a black girl.  First goddamn first line.  Gold coast slave ship.  That's why people thought he was evil.  Thought he was the devil.  That was his thing, right?  That was his Jagger.  That was his, you know.  My goodness.  People hated Mick Jagger at one point?  Oh, he was, you know, he was the scare.  He was the bad boy.  He was stirring up controversy, getting banned.  Like, that's his thing.  So, still, it's still written before you were born and it's still shaking you up. 
[03:01:30]  I didn't know the hook was about black girls.  Like, I just, it's just, all right, whatever.  Brown sugar.  Peggy's shoes about a lynching?  What?  It's impossible.  What?  What's I can't get no satisfaction about?  What?  Looks like he was getting all the satisfaction he needed, man.  I wanted to kill 20 bitches while I killed 14.  Damn it.  All right.  Slave ship.  All right.  You guys see the heavy metal movie?  Thank God for Earl. 
[03:02:00]  Which?  Which?  The one that's not even out yet.  We got a screener's copy and we have the guys on.  It's a documentary on heavy metal?  I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen it.  Earl, you've seen it yet?  I haven't seen it yet.  All right.  There goes that.  There's that.  All right.  We got to get, actually, Tom in here to do his Stephen Wright.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  This show started off really weird.  Yes.  There was no energy.  Yes, sir.  I'll agree, sir.  And we invited this intern in because he has a really red face from the Yankee game yesterday  and he was speaking monotone. 
[03:02:30]  He had no energy whatsoever.  None.  Yeah, he talks like this.  And he moves real slow as well, obviously.  Where is he?  What?  Oh, now he's missing.  Is he still pulling pudding out of his ear?  Look at Twitch.  I think my book's selling it.  You know, books, there's no sound scan for books.  So you just put it out there and wait.  And you kind of see what happens.  See when the returns come back in and unless it's, you know, huge. 
[03:03:00]  Is there a big book piracy out there?  Yeah, there's a lot of the bootleg.  Yeah, they're selling them out of duffel bags on the sidewalk.  Yeah, the writers are fine.  Books are fine.  People are downloading that for, you know.  Yeah, the writers are still safe.  They're getting nothing back.  Is it all?  They're still safe.  No, you look at, you know, you check your Amazon thing, two people buy it.  It jumps 100,000 places and then it, you know.  Do you read your comments?  It is the least, it's so anticlimactic. 
[03:03:30]  I'm used to magazine.  I was a magazine, been a magazine writer for years.  You put a magazine out there.  It's out there.  You see it everywhere.  Who pays you?  You get your advance.  Then if it sells enough, then when your advance is paid out, you come back later.  How do you think like Stephen King and the big boys?  No, that's a whole nother.  That's like launching Mission Impossible and a serial line and a toy store.  Semi-trucks full of money.  Yeah.  Before you even come up with a concept for a book.  They just back the truck up with the advance, hand you all of that.  Dean Koontz and all of them.  Yeah, that's, but the book business is weird because there's like, no, that's cool. 
[03:04:00]  It's, you know, it's entertainment, you know.  Who's the big boy?  Well, those guys, I mean.  Michael Crichton.  Who's the biggie biggie?  I don't think, when he turns it on, I mean, I think Stephen King is still king of the hill, right?  I would say he's the master of macabre if I could make that up and maybe he'll run with it.  Dean Koontz is up there with him, though, man.  Dean Koontz?  He's fallen off.  I think a lot of Stephen King fans don't like Dean Koontz.  It's all about Dan Brown.  Dan Brown.  What?  Dan Brown. 
[03:04:30]  Who's that?  Da Vinci Code.  Oh, the Da Vinci Code.  Only the biggest book ever.  They should have never made that into a movie because I would never have a chance to read that book now.  I'm going to read it.  Were you going to read it anyway?  Yeah.  Enough people were talking about it.  I'm in the same boat as Patrice, except I'm getting to whip the women just around midnight.  I'm in the same boat as you.  I will not read the book if the movie comes out.  But if enough people keep talking about it, the book's been out for how many years and you haven't read it yet?  I would get around to it.  I'm reading other stuff. 
[03:05:00]  I read that book easily two years ago, maybe more.  Da Vinci Code, is it good?  It's really good.  It's a page turner.  I read Animal House before that came out.  Oh, wow.  I get the book that has the characters from the movie on the cover.  John De Vinci, he'd be great as this character.  Let's say hi to Lady Trucker.  Lady Trucker.  Ma'am, ma'am.  Hey, how you doing, Patrice?  Hello, ma'am.  I got a hook for you.  Peanut butter on crackers.  Oh.  For your brown sugar answer song.  Oh, for my answer song.  Oh, the answer, yeah.  I got to figure that out.  I'm going to write it. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  I'm definitely going to fucking write it.  Fuck that.  That's one to write.  A follow-up hit to It's Raining Stuff.  It's raining stuff.  Here he is.  Good luck.  Here he is.  He's got his own entrance music and everything.  It's the Jurassic Park music because of his short little arms.  He's got a little T-Rex arm.  I didn't notice that.  Yeah, you wouldn't have.  He hides it with really big shirts.  He's like the T-Rex.  Actually, they don't really look short today.  No, it's the shirt.  Because the shirt goes down pretty, like... 
[03:06:00]  Most people's arms, I think, dangle almost to their kneecap.  Their middle finger almost hits their kneecap.  He can scratch his titties without bending anything.  Auditioning.  Your mama.  Auditioning.  That's what the fucker looks like.  That is a bitch, dude.  Your mama.  All right, we get it.  Does anyone notice?  Unless people point it out.  About him.  I can't believe that crap is on MTV. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe eight seconds.  Your mama.  Oh, with that corny, evidently a sissy.  Dude.  Nick Cannon?  No, not Nick Cannon.  The dude from the 70s show, right?  Oh, goodness gracious.  No.  I don't know.  Yes, the Indian...  Tom, how are you?  Pretty good.  How are you?  See?  That's all he gives us.  Pretty good.  Have people ever noticed about the arm thing or anything?  Yes.  They brought it.  Your friends have always kind of teased him about it.  Yes.  He's shaped like five different people. 
[03:07:00]  He's in shape, out of shape.  He's got a big head, a little head.  His head's big and little at the same time.  He was this close to being a dwarf.  Maybe that was like...  At the last minute.  At the last second, God said, ah, no, I'm just kidding.  He really is built like a fetus.  Like a...  Like...  Like you can see his fingernails.  He really is built like the second trimester.  Your mama...  Your mama's...  Your mama's so...  Your mama's arms are so short. 
[03:07:30]  A whole fucking show about that.  They've gone out of ideas in Hollywood.  It's official.  Your mama's so black when I look at her, I think I'm asleep.  And that's the reaction half the time.  You're like, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny, yeah.  Anyway, Tom.  Well, Tom, have you gotten any energy since you've been here this morning? 
[03:08:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  I can kind of hear it in your voice.  He's a radio DJ, too.  Alan.  Alan Lice.  Very famous writer in studio.  Nice to meet you.  Happy to be here.  Happy to witness a moment like this.  What's your favorite band?  I'm more into hip-hop, but...  That counts?  Other than that...  Too short.  Motherfucker, too short.  Bis Maki and fucking too short.  Too short.  He looks like Bis Maki and too short put together. 
[03:08:30]  Fottle of Clorox.  I guess in terms of hip-hop, probably D-Block and...  For rock, probably Linkin Park.  Nice.  All right.  Sounds very enthusiastic about it.  Did you like the collaboration with Jay-Z?  What happens when Jay-Z says, throw your hands in the air?  He hits himself in his ears.  Fuck, you fucking asshole. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  So, we noticed that he sounds a lot like Stephen Wright.  All right.  With his monotone delivery, so...  So, we just wanted to hear a few of the classic Stephen Wright jokes done.  Yeah, we highlighted the better ones for you there.  Made it real easy for you, Tom.  All right.  Yesterday, I parked my car in a tow-away zone.  When I came back, the entire area was missing.  Yeah.  That's about it. 
[03:09:30]  Kind of sounds like the guy.  Yeah, that's about how he does it.  This is almost like your mama.  That's what you pay $100 for.  I had to stop driving my car for a while.  The tires got dizzy.  All right.  A couple more.  I recently moved into a new apartment.  And there was this switch on the wall that didn't do anything.  So, anytime I had nothing to do, I just flicked the switch up and down. 
[03:10:00]  Up and down.  Up and down.  Then, one day, I got a letter from a woman in Germany.  It just said, cut it out.  I put instant coffee in my microwave oven.  It almost went back in time.  These are hard.  How come when Stephen Wright does it, people laugh? 
[03:10:30]  I think it's visual, too.  It's got to be.  Yeah.  It's got to be, right?  Because when you just read them or hear them.  Because it sounds just like Stephen.  It sounds like.  But I'm like, oh, no.  Is Stephen not funny?  It can't be.  Maybe Stephen's not funny, but.  No, he's funny.  Turn him on and get a chuckle.  Fuck me.  Yeah, of course he's funny.  But what the fuck's going on here?  All right.  A few more there, Tom.  It's a weird experiment here.  I saw a man with a wooden leg and a real foot. 
[03:11:00]  Maybe he's not delivering it exactly like.  Read that one again.  But Stephen goes.  Nothing can make that one funny, Patrice.  No, you know.  A man with a wooden leg and a real foot.  Yeah.  It's like he's not reading it with the timing of Stephen.  It's all the ingredients to a cake, but they're not mixed right.  Beat is a beat.  Just like his body.  All right.  It's all the parts you need, but they're just not put together right.  This next one, read.  You know what beat is?  You know what they say when you get beat?  Of course you do, right?  Okay.  So just do the I met thing with a beat and just wait a beat and then do the last thing, 
[03:11:30]  the punch.  See if that's Stephen right.  I met her at Macy's.  She was shopping.  I put Slinky's on the escalator.  I was put.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it gets even worse when you miss a word.  Dennis Leary's not calling you anytime soon to read.  No.  Some people think George is weird because he has sideburns behind his ears.  I think George is weird because he has false teeth with braces on them. 
[03:12:00]  George is a radio announcer, and when he walks under a bridge, you can hear him talk.  You what?  You can't hear him talk.  You can't hear him talk.  Yeah, see, because you drive under a bridge.  Wow, you are leaving out the most important word.  In the past two, he's left out the most important word.  But he's doing pretty good on them long ones, though, because I'm like, what the fuck?  Awesome.  Short one.  I bought some batteries, but they weren't included, so I had to buy them again.  That's Stephen Wright.  That's Stephen Wright. 
[03:12:30]  That is him.  It's funny when Stephen Wright says it.  What?  What?  I don't get it.  Maybe Stephen Wright is brilliant.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I bought some batteries, but they weren't included, so I had to buy them again.  Damn.  But if you do that in quiet, in isolation in a studio, I mean, can you get those across anyway? 
[03:13:00]  That's very fair, too.  The crowd means something, too.  I think if, like you said, if Galilee came in and just smashed a watermelon, no one would  laugh.  Like, we would go, okay, this nigga just smashed a watermelon with a hammer.  I don't care if he's in front of the entire population of this country.  That shit ain't funny.  When he smashes that fucking watermelon.  All right.  Jesus.  Continue, Tom.  If you can't hear me, it's because I'm in parentheses.  Plus, maybe that's funny.  We're reading along. 
[03:13:30]  We know the surprise.  I mean, we know the thing that's coming.  All right.  I'm not reading.  The thing that's coming.  Oh, wow.  Very good observation.  That's why I'm the journalist here.  I'm trying to, you know.  Understand, right?  It's like, wait a minute.  You're waiting for it.  Because I'm about to go to Steve Ray going, nigga, you ain't funny.  And maybe this is killing to people listening at home.  Maybe this is working.  I've been reading this at feedback.  I'm just asking.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I get it, Tom.  I have a map of the United States.  It's original size. 
[03:14:00]  It says one mile equals one mile.  I didn't read along with that one.  But I did read it earlier.  There goes that theory.  So, well, no, no, maybe.  Turn the page.  Read one that we didn't, you didn't write.  Turn the page.  There you go.  You didn't highlight, right?  Now just read one.  I'm going to clear my mind.  I'm going to shut my eyes and imagine Stephen Wright.  Well, do the one after the original size map.  Stephen Wright's in front of me.  Today I met with a subliminal advertising executive for just a second. 
[03:14:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a tough joke, though.  It's almost funnier, though.  Your picture's Stephen Wright.  I was sitting there.  I was in a crowd.  I was at the stage.  I had the whole thing.  I can't believe you're making a funny Stephen Wright joke.  And today is experiment day.  Of course it is.  This whole show is a big beaker.  Let it rip. 
[03:15:00]  I used to be a bartender at the Betty Ford Clinic.  I keep waiting for the next line.  I had a dream that all victims of the pill came back.  Boy, were they mad.  Today I dialed the wrong number.  The other side said, hello.  I said, hello.  Could I speak to Joey?  They said, I don't think so.  He's only two months old.  I said, I'll wait.  I have a friend named Dennis.  Both his parents are midgets, but not Dennis.  He's a midget dwarf. 
[03:15:30]  He's the guy who poses for trophies.  Now, I saw his original hour special when he said that joke.  And I laughed like a motherfucker.  Right.  I laughed like a...  I thought that was the funniest joke I ever heard.  He poses for trophies.  It's hysterical.  Why the fuck did that just make me want to hit this motherfucker with a branch?  Well, don't get mad at him reading jokes he didn't write.  No, but I'm saying...  But he sounds just like Steven Wright. 
[03:16:00]  Right.  It's the same delivery.  It's the...  But even in fucking Reservoir Dogs, it's like...  I think it has to be...  No one else can do it but him, maybe.  Because he goes...  You know, the radio guy, when he's like...  Yeah.  K-2-1-0.  It's like, maybe he has a natural time in that...  K-Billy's.  Yeah, it was K-Billy's, like, super hits of the 70s.  Let's go to Mud Jacket.  Mud Jacket.  Hey, I just got a question for Tommy.  Yeah.  Hey, did you ever get a chance to do the wave last night at the baseball game? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, shit.  Or is that why you're so fucking tired this morning?  Because you kept trying to jump up and just couldn't quite keep up with everybody.  The wave.  He stopped all the waves.  The people went, oh, no one else is doing it.  Do we have access to some of the comedy channels stuff on Dillette?  Do we have any Stephen Wright?  I would love...  Let's hear Stephen Wright.  I want to hear Stephen Wright doing Stephen Wright and see what the difference is.  We've got to get to the bottom of this.  Danny in Jersey.  Danny.  Hey, boys. 
[03:17:00]  Hey.  Holy shit.  Now I know why Stephen Wright doesn't sell any albums.  But he does.  This sucks on the radio.  But he does.  He does all right for himself.  We don't understand why it's not working.  Oh, I think it's Stephen Wright's looks.  That's what's funny.  It could be.  His appearance is...  But...  No, because...  But I listen to the album.  Yeah, you listen to the records.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  He's funny.  He's a funny dude, man.  This is like graduate school comedy analysis.  Yes.  This is like...  Why isn't it working? 
[03:17:30]  Did you see Half-Bank when he was on the guy on the couch?  Yeah.  He's fucking hilarious.  Hysterical.  All right.  Hey.  Why isn't he funny?  By the way, the Twitchell video from yesterday of him slapping his face when we discovered  that's his latest thing he does is now up online for everyone to view.  Very good.  At opianathony.com.  Is he still here, by the way?  Yeah.  Founcing me, Rock?  What's up, Thane?  Okay.  No, I was going to tell him which jokes that we have.  Oh, we got the same joke?  All right.  So we can do them, too. 
[03:18:00]  Today at Yankee Stadium.  Actually, Stan, stay there.  Have him read the joke, and then we'll get the Stephen Wright version after he reads it.  It's a whole bit, so it might not be the exact joke.  Oh, I see.  Okay, okay.  Well, just have him do whatever you want first, and then we'll have a reference point.  It's the Winnie jokes.  All right.  Here we go.  My friend Winnie is a procrastinator.  He didn't get his birthmark until he was eight years old.  It'll be funny if Stephen Wright called and go, this nigga's chopping up my shit. 
[03:18:30]  Tell this little old motherfucker, if he's going to read my shit, read it right.  It's like this.  Batteries.  Batteries.  They weren't included.  You're Stephen wrong.  Stephen.  Oh, shit.  Winnie and I lived in a house that ran on static electricity. 
[03:19:00]  If you wanted to run the blender, you had to rub balloons on your head.  Now, that was pretty spot-on Stephen Wright.  I know.  That was pretty fine.  That was pretty fine delivery.  We're going to have him on in the future as Stephen Wright and not tell anybody.  And then they'll think it is funny as hell.  It sounds just like Stephen Wright.  There's a little piece of Stephen Wright that's missing that sounds like somebody else.  Kind of does something with his voice.  Damone?  Yeah, not a Damone.  No, it sounds like something else.  Have some pride.  Can't place him.  Have some pride.  That uniform is part of him. 
[03:19:30]  It might be him, right?  All right, are we going to listen to the real Stephen Wright now?  Is that...  Yeah, let's listen to some real Stephen Wright.  See if it's funny.  For a while I lived in Vermont with a guy named Winnie.  We lived in a house that ran on static electricity.  See, he ain't getting nothing either.  We had to take a sweater off real quick.  Getting something?  That's polite laughing.  We wanted to run a blender.  We had to rub balloons on our head.  I thought I was a procrastinator until I met Winnie. 
[03:20:00]  Winnie got a birthmark when he was eight.  We heard these.  All Winnie did all day was practice limbo.  He got pretty good.  He could go under a rug.  People come over and say, what's that?  I said, that's Winnie.  About six months after we were living there,  I looked outside my window.  I saw a bird wearing sneakers.  He had a little button on it. 
[03:20:30]  I said, I ain't flying nowhere.  He has a different inflection, too, on something.  Yeah.  Up and down.  He's not straight monotone.  He's not just monotone.  I don't know if that helps, but he does have a different delivery.  All right.  Thanks, Tom.  Holy shit.  Job well done.  There you go.  How did you get the headphones off?  Did that help?  He need help reaching the door now?  He's too high and too low for the door.  Where's his music? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, where's his music?  He doesn't leave, Derek?  Oh, Derek.  I love that music.  Twitchels, come on in here.  Steven, right here.  That was interesting.  All right.  Here comes Twitchels.  Learned some things today.  Brown sugar.  Right, Joe?  Oh.  I once knew a guy named Twitchels that put pubic hair in his face.  You're all cleaned up now, man.  Yeah, not too bad.  Yeah?  You got all the hair off you?  Yeah.  What did you get, a new shirt? 
[03:21:30]  When I was wiping the water on my face to try to, like, you know, waterfall it off, pubic  hair kind of went right in my mouth and got stuck in my tooth.  Oh.  Whoa.  So the torture continues even in the bathroom.  That's the gift that keeps on giving.  Yeah, right?  Give it.  Ah!  Oh, God.  That was like, he's just, he's like, did that sound like one of the Beastie Boys?  It's a sabotage. 
[03:22:00]  It's a sabotage.  Ah!  Here's a little story.  Those guys could definitely do something with that, though.  I'll tell you right now.  It was fun.  I had a good time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you cleaned up, which is good.  Absolutely.  That's what I was going to say.  All right.  What would Stephen Wright with Tourette sound like? 
[03:22:30]  Uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, t-t-t-t-bring.  Really?  I was pulled over for speed and the officer said, don't you know?  I replied, yes, but...  Yeah, I know. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, we do.  We know.  We feel the same way.  So, get the plug in for the comedy show there, Twitch.  Well, it's going to be tomorrow night.  It's the premiere of the Short Bus Comedy Tour at the Laugh Factory in Times Square.  It's a nine o'clock show.  It's going to be a really hot show.  I'm really excited about it.  And, uh, it's our first time doing the Short Bus Tour in New York City tomorrow, nine o'clock  at the Laugh Factory.  And you got some coverage?  Yeah.  On Monday, as soon as I got back from the Tourette's Conference, I did a show called Your Morning  on CNA.  They're an Emmy Award winning morning show that reaches from Maine to Virginia. 
[03:23:30]  Emmy Award winning.  I say that because...  Every show is from Maine.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And I was so nervous because that's when I just...  You've all won one.  Well, that's just when I got back from the conference.  From Maine to Virginia sounds impressive, but how wide is it?  I have...  It's like two feet wide.  That's not that impressive.  Well, it was Monday, so that was right after I got back from the conference.  And I've been on the show a couple times before, and it never really had been that bad.  Usually I was able to control it while doing the interview, because it's like a five-minute 
[03:24:00]  interview.  And all the Short Bus guys were there, and it just went ballistic.  I just couldn't help it.  And the girl who interviewed me, the reporter, her name's Connie Kola, and she's actually...  She's been really good with it before, but I really think I made her feel uncomfortable  this time.  All right.  Let's listen in.  I met...  When I first started doing comedy, I met Tim Grill.  And...  As you can tell, Turek, you have good days and bad days.  And, you know, when I first met Tim, and I said, I said, what do you have?  He said, I have Spine and Bivita, and we were on the same show together.  So I said, you know what? 
[03:24:30]  It would be a great idea to put a tour together, some type of show, featuring all comedians  with disabilities.  Right.  And I heard so much about Mike Cattello.  He's been doing the scene in New York for so long, and I just...  It's never been done before, and I figured this would be such a...  Good idea.  That's the Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  Just kicking in now, right?  Yeah, that's exactly.  The Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  Y'all right there, buddy?  You can be a little back beside you.  Wow.  That poor lady.  We got more.  I always have people who say to me, they say, 
[03:25:00]  Oh, you have Tourette's?  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Things like that.  But you know what?  The point is, we're doing this because we want to spread awareness and have a good time.  You can never take yourself too seriously, and that's the whole point of this comedy tour.  It's not making fun of the characters of any...  Not making fun of the people who have disabilities, because we are people with disabilities.  We're saying, be yourself, and it's okay to be yourself.  Please use that!  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just going to be finished right now.  Be yourself.  He's really fun to take to church, isn't he?  He's the only guy that gets road rage. 
[03:25:30]  Holy Spirit.  He's the only guy that gets road rage on a train.  Wow.  Road rage.  He's the only guy that gets road rage on a train.  Sayonara.  Sayonara.  Speaking Japanese, the motherfucker.  Sean in Virginia.  Sean.  Hey, boys.  I learned that Twitch was in the bathroom.  Sounds like the three-stooled just fuck it.  That's right.  We did learn that today.  Yes. 
[03:26:00]  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Yeah.  Today on the show, I learned that rubbing the balls between the thighs equals wink, wink.  Wink, wink.  That's right.  We did learn that.  The given.  Brian in Rhode Island.  Brian.  Hey, how you doing?  I learned that a cock ring makes your dick all veiny and blue.  Yeah.  We learned a lot of weird stuff today.  Ben's raw ass.  Hey, guys.  Today, I think we all learned a little something about the brown sugar lyrics.  Yes.  I wonder how many people out there really knew that, honestly. 
[03:26:30]  I think that was a surprise to a lot of people.  I think a lot of people like to come off like they're cool and they knew, but they didn't.  Yeah.  Alan Light's book, The Skills to Pay the Bills, The Story of the Beastie Boys, is now in paperback.  In stores now.  Wow.  And that's the reaction we're looking for.  You say you get no feedback on a book, you get that, you know you're doing something.  He's got ringtones.  He's got ringtones.  Oh, by the way, they're-  When do I get my ringtones?  They're going to be available any day now.  They're already available overseas. 
[03:27:00]  You just Google it and-  Overseas?  I know.  I don't even tell me.  What are you, a phenomenon in Germany?  No, no.  It's like David Hasselhoff of Tourette's.  Band in China.  Right.  Yeah.  We don't write the bring.  He says band in China.  Don't do your bring or to-  Sounds too much like some shit we say.  Yeah.  They understand him.  Oh, yeah.  See.  Did I just say see?  See. 
[03:27:30]  And you can check that out at laughterbylou.com.  Mexican part of China.  I don't know any-  Mexican sound and Mexican-Chinese bastards.  Fucking stupid as-  I don't know if you see.  Let's see how to John.  Hey, John.  Yeah, today I learned that dignity is a disease.  Yes, we did learn that.  Sorry.  Sorry, I was a little distracted.  Sorry about that.  Mark, no.  Dude, I just want to- 
[03:28:00]  Mark the trucker.  What's up?  Hawk.  Guys, today I learned your intern's arms are so short, he's got to sit down and jerk off.  His arms are so short, he had to sit down and jerk off.  Right, right.  Oh, there you go.  Sean in Jersey.  Sean, what did you learn on the opening after the show today?  I learned that niggas wear Yankee hats because they match their socks.  Wear it up.  What?  Asshole.  Doughboy.  What's going on?  Hey.  The ball brush is a massagist wink.  Yeah, we said that one already.  Yeah.  Eye blow.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  Token gay.  Hey, I learned that Twitchell's plus Danny's pubic hair equals jerking off material for  a week.  Oh, Jesus.  Howdy.  That was genius.  That was actually genius.  Patrice, are we promoting anything today?  We're doing the show with us for the rest of the week, so.  Yeah, you'll be in tomorrow and Friday.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah?  Stare at me a little more, please.  Final words.  Go to laughterbylou.com for the ringtones. 
[03:29:00]  And furthermore.  I'd like to add.  Yeah.  He does sound like a Hitler speech, doesn't he?  Stop swapping yourself.  Right.  Right.  Right.  See you tomorrow.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  There are two types of poker players in the world.  Winners and losers. 
[03:29:30]  And unless you're winning all the time, well, you might want to head over to bodog.net.  That's B-O-D-O-G dot net.  Bodog, going to help you understand how to win at poker.  And who doesn't want to be a winner?  Bodog will help you.  And there.  Good night.  Good night. </pre>
