<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with significant technical difficulties, causing humorous frustration for Opie and Anthony as they struggled to resolve microphone issues.  The show then pivoted to Anthony's deep involvement in EverQuest 2, detailing his gameplay, virtual battles ("defiled torrents and gelatinous cubes"), quest for a wizard robe, and his solo player persona, "Jax."  He discussed the game's addictive nature ("Evercrack"), referencing Ben Stein's son needing intervention due to excessive play.  Anthony also described meeting and interacting with other online players, often veering into sexually suggestive and crude humor.  Listener calls frequently mocked Anthony's obsession, prompting discussions about online marriages within the game and player jealousy.  One caller even mentioned Kurt Schilling's involvement with the game.

A segment titled "Fag Talk," featuring guest "Bob the Fag Man," followed, focusing on humorous anecdotes about sharing a cigarette ("fag") with a romantic partner post-intimacy.  The hosts then discussed their XM Satellite Radio free play week, the anxieties of XM executives regarding their content, and recounted past incidents involving an intern and a porn star guest, and a cherry dart game with nude porn stars.  They also described a listener contest involving smelling a cyst behind Rich Voss's ear. The show concluded this section with discussion of a documentary about dwarfism.

A subsequent segment detailed the exploits of intern Noah, who spent a weekend with 20-year-old Cleveland porn star Candy.  Graphic details of their multiple sexual encounters were discussed, with Candy herself calling in to confirm the events and praise Noah's performance.  The hosts also extensively covered Jim Norton's attempt to arrange a paid sexual encounter with Candy, negotiating a price down from $1000 to $500, before ultimately declining.  A voicemail from Jim Norton's mother expressing concern (while remaining supportive) about his "ladies of the evening" was played, followed by further discussion of Norton's sex life and attempts to quit paying for sex.

The show continued with a rambling collection of segments.  A nonsensical phone call segment involving Barbie dolls and Beanie Babies preceded Opie recounting bizarre encounters, including a woman only aroused by Jewish cowboys.  The hosts jokingly claimed credit for XM's success, while promoting their MyFi giveaway.  They then discussed the stresses of Christmas shopping, leading to a discussion of a listener-suggested eggnog puking contest, reminiscent of a past clam chowder contest.  A segment about staff member Ben's illness and extreme recovery measures followed, transitioning into news stories about a lottery winner's divorce and a woman seeking her ex-husband's medical license suspension for unpaid child support.  The show included prank calls involving a nanny pretending to be a pornographer and a son claiming jail time with prostitutes, including a transvestite, both eliciting emotional reactions from the mothers.  This concluded with Jim Norton recounting an awkward Broadway premiere experience, encountering several celebrities and his interaction with Robin Williams, punctuated by jokes about Norton's weight.

Another segment focused on Jim Nortonâ€™s experiences at a celebrity event, detailing his unsuccessful attempts to get photos with Robert De Niro ("Bob") and Billy Crystal, contrasting these with positive interactions with Rob Reiner and Yogi Berra. Audio clips captured his interactions and post-event dejection.  The conversation included discussions about other celebrities, Norton's feelings of being an "outcast," and listener calls, notably with Lady Di and Marion.  A "top ten corniest movie lines" segment was interspersed with listener calls and banter.  A listener suggested photoshopping Norton's face onto a picture with De Niro.

A phone call with "Lady Di," a financially struggling woman, followed, featuring aggressive questioning from the hosts about her joblessness, welfare status, and injuries.  Derogatory terms were used while speculating about her lifestyle and weight.  The "popcorniest lines" countdown continued, including a recording of what they described as "retards" singing the *Dirty Dancing* theme song.  They discussed upcoming radio show plans, including a segment on a white power music record label and a call from a listener insulted by a host.  The show concluded with a listener call-in segment and XM radio advertisements.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Nothing works here. 
[00:04:30]  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What about that private pile?  You are a disgusting fat body, private pile.  What side was that private pile? 
[00:05:00]  What side was that private pile?  Sir, left side, sir.  Are you sure, private pile?  Sir, yes, sir.  What side was that private pile?  Sir, right side, sir.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, it's on.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[00:05:30]  Hello.  Oh, yeah.  Your mic's much better today, right?  That's better.  Broadcasted on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Would they fix it?  Because now it's really loud.  You're booming.  I know.  They always go from one extreme to the other.  How's that?  Good.  Okay.  Sounds, um...  Okay, that'll work.  Yeah.  I like it.  Good.  Good morning.  How are you, Anthony?  Good. 
[00:06:00]  Good.  I don't like the way it sounds at all, by the way.  Really?  Son of a bitch.  I don't know.  They said they would adjust it during the break.  Adjust it during the...  It's all like...  It's so bad.  It's so distorted.  Oh, I hear the distortion.  Listen to it.  It's awful.  It might...  The volume might be good, but the distortion is horrid.  Yep.  I hear that, actually.  Why'd they do anything to it?  I don't know.  Why couldn't they just turn the volume up like we've been doing every day? 
[00:06:30]  Go, okay, I'll push the volume up a little bit higher on mine.  Now it sounds like it's coming through a tin can.  I'll just do the show like this.  Hey, how you doing, though?  Yeah, good?  Yeah, it's great.  Good.  Oh, they fixed the microphone?  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  You want to try that one?  I will.  There we go.  That's how it's supposed to sound, right?  Yeah.  Maybe?  It's two different mics.  That better?  You sound deep and bassy.  I do sound deep and bassy. 
[00:07:00]  Because I was up a little late.  Up a little later than usual last night, Opie.  I was going for my wizard robe.  My wizard armor robe.  EverQuest 2.  Heavily involved in EverQuest 2.  I'm a level 20 wizard, bordering on level 21.  I was on a quest last night with a big group of people in Stormhold.  Now that's distracting me.  There we go.  What a great way to start our free play week, huh?  Hey, free play.  We'll get into that in a minute.  But yes, Jim? 
[00:07:30]  I just wanted to let the audience know.  What were you going for?  I was going for my wizard armor quest, my robe.  A lot of people may not be familiar with what that is.  It's right up there on the masculine sail with going for your AZT.  It's the game I've been playing.  EverQuest 2.  I'm heavily involved.  And I was in Stormhold with a group of four other people last night.  Various classes.  You know, I'm the wizard.  Then we have a guy there that takes care of the heavy hitting with the swords and healers and whatnot. 
[00:08:00]  And I'm going through a quest.  I was killing defiled torrents and gelatinous cubes last night.  And I still have to go to the library and kill these flying books in order to advance in the quest of part four of my five-part quest.  Who needs books?  Right.  I just hit them with my magical heat and cold spells.  And I'll get my wizard robe, I believe, by probably tonight or tomorrow. 
[00:08:30]  You do realize you're a shock jock, right?  Yes, shock jock.  I shock people by my faggotness.  You're embarrassing us, us fellow shock jocks.  With your nerd-ism.  Let me tell you, hundreds of thousands of people play this game, Opie.  By the way, now I hate this mic.  Do you hate this mic, too?  I hate this mic, too.  Right when we get used to things.  I don't know why we have to try new things live on the show.  I don't get that.  Can we do a test before the show, after the show? 
[00:09:00]  Because now it's going to take forever to even get it back to where it was.  I'm not happy with this microphone either, right?  You aren't either.  No, it's really...  It's really bad.  It's a distraction, actually.  God.  Because, yeah, when the sound changes, even if it is good, whenever the sound changes,  it's kind of distracting.  Yeah.  When you do a radio show, you want everything to be the same every single day.  Same as it was yesterday.  If a mic's different or whatever, the volumes have changed. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It just messes up the whole flow of a radio show.  It throws you for a loop, as they say.  Because we're divas.  I'm a microphone diva.  All right, we're going to have to just make believe that the mic's good.  So, go ahead.  You sound fine to me, but I don't know if that matters, but you both sound normal to me.  Yeah.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  I sound normal.  All right, so you spent the night playing EverQuest, too.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I was up a little late trying to get my wizard robe.  I've been walking around in the same wizard robe for, I don't know, about ten levels.  About ten levels.  It takes a while.  So, now I'm very excited that I'll be getting this new wizard robe with newer stats on it and everything. 
[00:10:00]  So, I'll be even more powerful a wizard when I get this robe.  When does this stupid game end, by the way?  Is this the online version?  EverQuest, of course.  The online version, I know, never ends.  But, can't you just play the game?  No, there's really no single-player version for this.  Oh, I did not know that.  No, you get online.  You must subscribe.  You must pay money to play this, by the way.  I believe it's up to, like, 20 bucks a month that I pay for the pleasure of playing this game. 
[00:10:30]  And there's hundreds of thousands of people that play this.  But it never ends.  It's EverQuest.  You just keep going.  You try to level up higher and higher.  You try to get better equipment.  That's the whole thing.  That's, like, what you want to do.  You want to get some uber gear and get your stats up and become all-powerful, Opie.  And I've been approached by a couple of guilds, but I'm staying away from those because of what happened last time I was in the Hats and Hats guild. 
[00:11:00]  Hats and Hats guilds are kind of like gangs, right?  It's a cool gang to be in, Opie.  It's a gang, but you all wear pointy hats.  No, only certain classes wear the pointy hats.  I don't even believe there are pointy hats.  With astrological symbols on them.  Little stars and half moons.  Little stars and half moons, you faggot.  Put a lucky charms box on your head and a dress on.  I cast a spell and the broom went crazy.  Instead of your gang having gats, you got, like, a pretty little wand with a star on the top of it. 
[00:11:30]  No, I didn't go with the wand.  I have a wizard staff that I can take from my back, and I can beat the bad guys with it and cast my spells as I'm beating them.  So you're staying out of the guilds.  Yeah, I'm not into the guild right now.  I think I'm happier out on the plains of Antonica by myself battling various bad guys that come up across my path.  You just don't like your regular life.  You have to, like, submerge yourself into this cyber world. 
[00:12:00]  Into cyber world.  But I've always been like that.  I don't think it has anything to do with regular life.  I love my regular life.  I love coming to the job and doing radio.  It's fun.  But then, you know, there are certain times when I just want to sit in front of a computer and enter that virtual world, Opie.  Yes.  Sometimes it is a lot of fun to be able to run.  You know, you meet other people online.  I met this beautiful, I believe she was a sorcerer last night. 
[00:12:30]  Looked very hot on the screen until she said, have to go now.  The baby's crying.  Just zap it with a lightning bolt, you fat whore.  You know, it just gets like that, you know.  So you're, wow.  Wandering about.  It's so funny because a lot of our fans, they think we have just the greatest lives. 
[00:13:00]  They have no idea how really lonely we are.  The life of a shock jock, and I hate that term, but it's pretty boring.  I was shocking with some of my electric spells last night.  I was a shock wizard last night, Opie.  Taking care of business.  How many hours are you playing a day now?  It does vary, and I take some time off a lot of times if I'm crafting, if I'm crafting  some things that I have to make, and then I sell them, I will go into my hotel room in 
[00:13:30]  the game and sell my goods.  But while I'm doing that, I'm not going to sit there and just look at the screen because  it takes hours to sell some of the stuff you make for various copper, silver, gold,  and platinum pieces.  And when that's happening, I'll then go inside, watch TV, have sexual intercourse with a real  girl.  It's so funny how you had to just add that in. 
[00:14:00]  Because you started to realize in your head how faggy this sounds.  Like, you know, if I tell people I'm actually banging a real girl, I'll be cool again.  Well, you know, the movie will come on.  It's still faggy.  I'm going to watch TV with my girlfriend, will lay in bed and watch TV, order something,  and while my goods are being sold.  And then run back to see how many goods you've sold.  Yeah, I'll put my little house pants on and run inside and go, oh, I sold four silver spikes 
[00:14:30]  for four pieces of silver each that I crafted myself.  And then, you know, I'll get back on the game and do a little more adventuring.  Maybe I feel like going to Thunder Step.  Maybe I feel like taking a trip out on the plains, do some harvesting of some wood products,  or mining for a metal that I will use later to craft some plate armor.  So how many hours a day?  Did you say that?  It could be about ten hours a day.  Are you really up to about ten hours a day already?  It could be ten.  I've heard, man. 
[00:15:00]  It could be twelve.  This game is so addicting.  They call it Evercrack.  Kids have killed themselves.  They've killed themselves.  Ben Stein's son, Ben Stein had to do an intervention with his son because his son was freaking out  that he was cutting him off from playing EverQuest.  This is EverQuest 1.  EverQuest 2 is just as good, in my opinion.  And they would wake up at night and hear, like, sounds coming from the living room.  And Ben Stein would come out and, oh, my God, my son's playing EverQuest again. 
[00:15:30]  And he physically had to remove him from the computer and got rid of the computer,  sent his son to some kind of rehab, and now his son's not allowed to play anymore.  There's video game rehab?  Yeah, there's video game rehab, especially for this game.  People have lost their girlfriends, wives over this game.  Well, I've read a real interesting article on video games in general, especially this online gaming.  Yeah.  And it's getting to the point where people really don't care about their real lives anymore.  You know, they've got regular jobs. 
[00:16:00]  Maybe they work in a deli or they're a mechanic or a secretary or what have you.  Yeah.  And they're not even trying to better themselves in the real world anymore because they find  their online life so much more exciting.  That's what happens.  So they're pretty much just going to their regular jobs to make enough money to pay their  bills and get the latest video card or what have you.  And then they're really living their lives more and more online.  You know, they're much more into that than actually going outside and throwing the ball  around or socializing with, you know, face-to-face people. 
[00:16:30]  Who do you want to be?  Do you want to be Bob that fixes the copy machine down at IBM?  Or do you want to be like Ralthrop, the sword-toting warrior that, you know.  I'd rather be Jim McGreevy.  You'd rather be a gay governor from, ex-governor from Jersey, yeah.  And, you know, people, it's called massive multiplayer, you know, online role-playing 
[00:17:00]  game.  And you get hundreds of thousands of people on various servers and they link up.  It's an online community.  You see these people on a daily basis.  You pass them by in the various villages and hamlets of the gaming environment and  you recognize them.  Hey, how you doing?  You know the names?  You know what they do?  You know where they come in handy if you need a favor or something?  So it is.  Some people are more satisfied with these online lives than they are with their lives. 
[00:17:30]  So you're really getting to know the other characters in your online community.  I'm more of a loner.  I'm a little greedy, a little selfish.  I like getting my stuff done.  If I need a group of people to defeat some mob that mob is a bad guy, defeat some mob.  Are you talking about Anthony the Shock Jock or Anthony the EverQuest faggot?  I'm talking about Jax.  My name is Jax online.  J-H-A-X.  It should be J-A-C-K-S.  That's what I should be doing instead of playing this.  No, but you bang your girlfriend. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Which makes it all...  Thank you for bringing that up, Toby.  It makes it much gooder.  What's your last name?  Other fellas on my face?  Well, the phones have exploded.  I am Jax of the Wrath.  Jax of the Wrath.  That's what I am.  And as I travel around, that's what people see over my little character.  Okay.  As I wander about the plains of Antonica.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I thought we cured you of this. 
[00:18:30]  Hold on.  No, there is no cure.  No, because when we were at WADW, you were doing EverQuest hardcore.  Uh-huh.  And then you kind of just stopped playing one day.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like when you decided to stop smoking cold turkey.  You just did it.  Yeah.  And you did the same thing with EverQuest, but for some reason, EverQuest 2 has creeped  into your life.  I had to check it out.  And it's taken hold.  I had to check it out.  Hey, I played Half-Life 2, and I beat it in like a week, okay?  And that's a cool manly shooting game.  Well, and the online version is pretty basic. 
[00:19:00]  You just go around and kill things.  Right.  But EverQuest 2, it's much more involved.  Very much more involved.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to know if this robe that Anthony's going after, is that different from the robe  that he gets at the little beauty parlor that he goes to?  The beauty parlor.  My grandma goes to a beauty parlor.  Well, you described your haircut last week, and it sounded like you went to a beauty parlor.  You're getting robes.  Well, John Sahag, you walk in when they cut your hair, and they give you a robe that you 
[00:19:30]  put on.  It's very comfortable.  It keeps your clothes nice.  You sit down in your robe, and they bring you beverages if you need, and they cut your  hair.  It's a very nice experience.  All right.  How much time do you spend around John Sahag?  John Sahag.  Not John's hog.  Brett in Illinois, what's up?  Hey, Brett, what's up?  What's up, man?  Yeah.  Come on.  Sorry.  Hi.  I thought you were trying to get the gay out of the show.  Stop it.  Yeah, this isn't gay.  There are many people. 
[00:20:00]  There's a difference.  This isn't gay.  It's faggity.  As a matter of fact, Boston Red Sox own, what was his name?  Jesus.  Kurt Schilling.  Kurt Schilling plays EverQuest?  Plays EverQuest.  He's done many interviews.  He's done interviews online on EverQuest sites about his game-playing experience.  So, you know, take that.  What's he searching for?  A new Achilles in a non-racist city to play in? 
[00:20:30]  I found the people very tolerant in the city of Kinos, which is my home city in the game.  Kinos.  That is where I hail from.  You hail from Kinos.  I hail from Kinos.  The evil people hail from Freeport.  Of course.  Yes.  Of course, Freeport.  Of course they do.  Yeah, all right.  Joe from Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, dude.  Hey.  You've got to take it easy. 
[00:21:00]  He's got to send half his points to his wife every month, so take it easy on him.  Half my stat points I have to send to the wife.  Yeah, do you have to do that?  No, they are all mine.  No one has even asked for them.  If you're the king of online gaming, your ex-wife doesn't get half of your stuff?  No.  She doesn't get half of your powers and half of your arrows and half of your goods that  you're selling?  Although I don't.  Or you're banging your girlfriend?  I don't think so.  Although the people online in this game have been married. 
[00:21:30]  They wed online.  And your brother just laughs in the corner.  Wait a minute.  What are you talking about?  There are weddings that they hold online where people actually get together in a big group  and there's a bride and groom and they craft.  There's actual rings that you can craft and give to each other.  Now, okay, here's the question.  Are the people that are getting married online, are they married in real life to other people?  I would assume some of them might be, but judging from the clientele that these games 
[00:22:00]  get, I would say probably not.  And is there a jealousy factor?  I think so.  I've read some things, yeah.  Would you, Anthony, get married online?  Oh, hell no.  Because I know you'll never get married again in real life.  No, I would not get married online.  I'm a loner in the game.  Yeah.  Can I ask you a question?  Yes, Jim.  Is it possible after the wedding, are you able to, if things aren't going well, are you  able to craft a rowboat and an anchor to tie around your neck?  You are so obsessed with them.  Yeah.  I love the case, too. 
[00:22:30]  Yes, you craft a little boat.  Why does it always have to go back to little Connor Peterson?  Little Connor.  A little lump of what could have beens.  Ah, Paul from Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, I was calling to back up, Anthony.  Thank you, Paul.  And now I'm sitting here listening.  I think I'm changing my mind.  I'm changing my account.  He definitely makes it sound even faggoty.  Look, I am adding that it is.  More faggoty than it is.  I've gotten married online.  I've gotten divorced online.  I actually got married in real life on Saturday. 
[00:23:00]  Vetted my wife, put her to sleep, and went down and played EQ, too.  Anthony, they're right.  You're gay.  I'm canceling my account.  What level are you, Paul?  17 Dark Elf.  17 Dark Elf.  Is that aggressive?  So you hail from Freeport.  Yes, I do.  Yes.  Oh, he's the evil one.  Is 17 Dark Elf pretty impressive?  Uh, no.  Yeah, I'm kind of liking it.  I think it's pretty average for what people are.  Like, I'm level 20, which is pretty average for what people are, for where the game came out.  Yeah, but it is a lot of fun.  There are people that are, like, level 35 already, and the game just came out. 
[00:23:30]  So they must really be playing a lot.  How high can you get?  I believe level 50 before any expansions are added on.  So, you know, I've got a ways to go.  I'm, and believe me, I'm telling everybody everything that's involved with this game and people that really get into it.  I'm very much a loner in the game.  I don't team up with people.  I'm not living the life.  I'm not going to the, believe it or not, there are EverQuest conventions that people actually travel to to meet the real people that are playing this game.  And they dress as their online characters. 
[00:24:00]  I love how your brother's just laughing in the corner.  I'll tell you why my brother's laughing a lot.  He has a roommate that hasn't seen, like, the day of, you know, the light of day in probably a decade.  Oh, he's in Tribes, right?  He was Tribes.  Now he's Wow.  Wow is a big one, too.  What?  What's Wow?  World of Warcraft.  Warcraft, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So when he's talking about Wowing, he's talking about going with, like, teenage boys and playing on a computer, not about getting some pity.  Whip them out Wednesday, right, right.  No, it's amazing. 
[00:24:30]  This guy, Chris, he's been a friend of our family since we were all just little, tiny little tots.  And he's pretty much blown off his real life at this point.  Yeah, I remember when he was playing Tribes, and that's all he did.  The guy goes to work and then comes home and closes his door.  It could be 90 degrees in the summer, a beautiful summer day, and he will stay in his room for, what, 12, 16 hours at a time?  Until he has to get up and go to work.  World of Warcraft is a huge game.  People are jumping all over that.  Also, City of Heroes was big. 
[00:25:00]  That was one where you're able to make a superhero, and you are then a superhero in this kind of comic book world,  and your job is then to fight the evil villains.  And you gang up with other superheroes with various powers and stuff, and you take on these evildoers.  Don't even get us started with superheroes.  You know, Jay was in town, and my brother and Jay and I went out drinking and stuff, and we were just discussing superheroes ad nauseum.  Ah, see?  My brother has a whole thing on Aquaman. 
[00:25:30]  Well, Aquaman, it was, they're at the Justice League, and something's going on underwater, and they're all looking at each other, and Batman just turns and was like, Aquaman, this one's for you.  Like, no effing kidding.  That's underwater.  You know?  What else do I have to do?  What else could he do?  I know, Aquaman.  What else did you send Connerman?  Oh, my God.  You'll have to keep going back there.  And then we just gave...  With his cinder block, he will swing it around his head.  We just came to the conclusion that Aquaman was pretty much useless.  Useless. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, how many underwater adventures were there?  That is really a lousy superhero.  It was like, oh, a submarine, you know, went down.  Okay, of course, you need Aquaman.  But in general, he was just a waste of space.  Aquaman uses his powers of the deep.  Yeah, because it's just awful.  There's nothing else he could do.  And what makes it worse is he's more like the guy who drives the van who goes and gets the migrant workers.  As soon as he dives in, then he starts telling all the whales, the dolphins, the eels to do all the dirty work for him.  And he just sits there.  He's like a foreman.  What kind of superhero is this guy? 
[00:26:30]  He's directing everyone.  That's all he's doing.  Never really thought about it that way.  He's a lazy F.  He's a lazy superhero.  Yeah, he really stinks.  Okay, there's a lot going on here.  Let's go to Indiana, Fort Wayne, and talk to John.  What's up, John?  Hey, John.  All right, John.  Hey, already.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Oh, thanks, John.  First of all, thanks for the free preview week.  Yeah, we started that today, I guess, huh?  Yes, sir.  I don't think I'm...  Telling everybody about it.  Oh, well, we appreciate that. 
[00:27:00]  I don't think it's a big deal, because it's only $2 extra a month to listen to us.  I know.  Some of these pansies out here don't want to pay $2, but I think this week, they'll say,  okay, it's definitely worth $2.  I mean, $0.07 a day, right?  It's only $0.07 a day.  That's all we ask, yes.  If you get $0.07 a day from us, then it's worth picking up our channel.  Jimmy, I think you're a genius.  I love the analogies.  Thank you very much.  Love you.  Thanks a lot for the show, guys.  And I love you.  All right, thank you, John.  Unfortunately, my personal life is in the toilet, but I appreciate your kind words. 
[00:27:30]  Speaking of which, we'll get into that next.  Yeah.  Bob the Trucker from New Mexico.  Don't answer his question, because we do have to go to break here, but he'll tease.  Yeah, he'll set up Act 2.  Go ahead, Bob.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Go ahead.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, Bob.  I want to know if you got lucky with that porn star the other day.  Oh, right.  Bob, we will answer that and many other questions in a few minutes.  You're not going to believe how that turned out.  I was laughing all morning long, all morning long, because you're a scumbag. 
[00:28:00]  I was not laughing.  I felt sympathy.  I openly laughed at Jim.  No, no, it's good.  I'm glad you enjoyed.  And Jim brought in a message from his mom.  You're not going to believe.  You're not going to believe this message from Jim Norton's mom.  All around, not a good weekend for you, Jim?  Dude, my whole, I really, really should blow my brains out.  I am worthless on every level.  Every level.  All right. 
[00:28:30]  Well, we'll get into it in a few minutes.  Just to wrap up the EverQuest discussion for today, let's say hi to Philly.  What's up, Philly?  Guys.  What's up, man?  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Am, when you're on EverQuest, when you encounter ice monsters, do you cast a Steve  spell to feed them?  Yes, I have my Steve spell, which I then pull out and cast and melt him.  It's amazing.  Big ice monster walking around.  He's wearing his flaming shirt and flaming hat and just melting under it. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  I don't like the ice monsters.  They melt on the equipment.  All right.

[00:29:30]  We'll talk about Friday.  We'll talk about what happened with the intern.  We'll talk about what Washington told us that we're not allowed to do anymore with our interns.  Lots and lots of things to get to.  Stay there.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello.  Welcome to another edition of Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as they call  them in America, cigarettes.  Let's not waste any more time.  Let's bring out Bob the Fag Man.  Bob, welcome to the show.  Thank you.  It's wonderful to have you here.  Good to be here.  And what a wonderful subject it is today as I looked over the notes before the show. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  And it's sharing a fag into your bed.  After you've just made fun.  Right.  Now explain.  Right.  You're with your spouse, your significant other, or your boy or girlfriend, whichever it  may be.  And afterwards, after that intimate moment, what better way than to share a fag with your  lover?  Exactly.  Pull a fag into bed and suck on it together.  What you've got to do is keep a fag nearby.  Right.  Pre-arrange this, you know.  In the room.  Right.  Right.  After you're done, say to your lover, would you like to share a fag with me?  It's very, very important to ask your lover, especially if you're not that familiar. 
[00:30:30]  Maybe this is a first girl.  That's right.  You don't want to scare them.  So you just say, would you mind if we brought a fag into the bed for us to suck on?  To suck on together.  You know, I'll suck a little, you suck a little, I'll suck you, suck back and forth, right,  suck.  One together.  Not, not...  It's not like roll over and go to sleep.  No, no, no.  There's one more thing.  Let's have a fag.  Right.  Between us.  It's the one common ground that we all have is enjoying a good suck on a fag.  Suck on that fag.  Love the fag.  Enjoy the fag together.  Suck.  Do the fag or suck. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Pass it over to your lover.  Let your lover suck on the fag.  And back to you.  It's wonderful.  It's very intimate.  Oh, yes, it is.  It's been a wonderful show.  Very nice.  Oh, Bob, thank you so much for being here.  Join us again.  We're out of time.  Next time, right here on Fag Talk.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.

Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  T-shirts are there for the first 10 ladies that Wow Rob.  I'm getting an erection as we speak. 
[00:34:30]  Once again, here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stomp.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  Hi, I'm Andy Davis, brought to you in part by Sun Valley, Idaho.  America's original year-round destination resort.  Announcing new daily non-stop flights from the West Coast.  Call 1-800-786-8259 for your Sun Valley ski vacation or visit sunvalley.com.  Two very different starts in the country for the skiing and riding season. 
[00:35:00]  Some cold weather helping out the East Coast a little bit with not a lot of natural snow.  But some spots through the West are certainly scoring big, already skiing and riding all of their trails.  Some new snow has certainly helped the cause, like in Utah, where they've gotten tons of snow already.  Park City, for example, up to 52 runs and 60% of their mountain up and going.  At Sun Valley, about 19 trails of patch powder to start their season.  Vail gets ready today with over 1,400 acres.  That's 95 trails already open this season at Vail.  In the East, Sunday River in Maine and Killington in Vermont, both with nearly 10 miles of open terrain. 
[00:35:30]  Hunter in New York, they're up to 9 runs with some top-to-bottom trails.  I'm John Davis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  Because your mom still buys your underpants.  Turn down your TV.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, little booper.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:36:00]  I want to say hi to everyone that's just trying us out as part of the free play week, Anthony.  Oh.  They're trying us out, deciding if they want to add this channel to their current account.  We've decided to go with the tactic of, well, the same tactic used by the drug dealer at the schools.  Give them the free crack. 
[00:36:30]  A little bit of the free crack at first.  Nah, here, this is for you.  Nah, free of charge, man.  You like it?  Just come back and let me know.  Yeah.  That's all.  And I guess the channel's going to be filled with a lot of our best of material from the first two months here at XM Satellite Radio.  I mean, this stupid show will replay a few times today.  And then in between, there'll be best ofs and things like that.  So you can get a real taste of what we do here.  Right.  As we attempt the greatest comeback in radio history.  Then if you like it, remember, remember who gave it to you for free. 
[00:37:00]  That's right.  And you just come back.  Your pal's Opie and Anthony.  So Friday, we did cherry darts for a MiFi.  We're going to have another MiFi to give away sometime this week.  I think we're going to do the Rich Voss thing.  Voss is coming in, what, tomorrow or Wednesday?  And...  Sorry, I was distracted by the morning wreck.  We have the morning wreck every morning here on the show.  Wow, this looks like a bad one, huh?  That car is in half.  No, it's...  I mean, it's not funny, but...  Wow.  The average person doesn't see this stuff, because by the time they wake up and start 
[00:37:30]  watching TV and driving in, they just hose these accident sites down, and you have no  idea that that happened, unless you're related to the people in that crash.  Right.  By rush hour, they have hosed it down and gotten everything off the road, and people are commuting.  That looks like a really, really bad one.  Yeah, that was in Brooklyn.  Yeah, we've talked about this...  Oh, your mic's not even on.  Sorry.  Oh, it's good.  We've talked...  This is one thing we've learned about, you know, getting up nice and early, that these  incredible wrecks every single overnight. 
[00:38:00]  Every single overnight.  And most of them are probably drunk driving or something, and then by the time the average  commuter is awake watching their morning news, this is long gone.  This is old news, and they hose down the highways, and it's business as usual.  Yeah, we get the live shot, and I'm looking right at a TV, so every single morning,  there's just carnage on the street.  Why is that car split in half, though?  I mean, what, one of Ben's turds?  Oh, yeah, we haven't even...  Wow, we didn't even touch on that.  We haven't even touched on Ben yet? 
[00:38:30]  All right, well, let's finish the thought.  So, Rich Voss is coming in tomorrow, Wednesday.  We've been asking people what they would do...  Tomorrow, Wednesday?  Tomorrow or Wednesday.  Oh, okay.  I just threw that.  I guess I just...  Tomorrow, Wednesday.  And we've been asking people what they would do for a MiFi.  You can go to opianthony.com or foundrymusic.com and tell us what you would do for a MiFi.  We're taking your better suggestions, and this one guy came up with a great one.  We had this friend, Rich Voss, and Voss has some weird thing that's happening behind his  ear.  It's some kind of old cyst or something that leaks...  An old cyst that somehow holds garbage juice, and it stinks when he rubs his little rotten 
[00:39:00]  turtle-toed fingers over it.  He's had it for years.  He rubs behind his ear and then makes people smell his finger.  And from what I hear, I refuse to smell it.  Everybody else has.  I've smelled it, and I started dry heaving.  Yeah.  I've seen three people puke.  Yep.  Just by smelling this.  It throws off this odor that's like what?  Garbage juice and dead animals.  It's like sour and cheese.  It's like a cheesy...  It's a meaty odor.  It violates you on a weird level. 
[00:39:30]  We used to say it smelled like rotten grape jelly.  Remember?  It's so much worse than that.  I say grape jelly.  You know what I'm saying?  I say grape jelly just to get people to smell it.  Right.  I'm like, dude, it smells like grape jelly.  And then they go, oh, grape jelly's not bad.  And then they get the putrescence of what is really behind his ear.  That's his gag to get people to smell it, saying it smells good, like grape jelly.  I think everyone has smelled their belly button if you haven't washed it in a day or two.  That's nothing compared to what's going on behind his ear.  Nothing.  So one of our fine listeners decided he would take one for the team for a MiFi. 
[00:40:00]  He's going to smell it live on the show tomorrow or Wednesday.  And then he's going to, what, lick his finger or something like that?  Or suck his finger?  He's going to suck the finger.  I even think he should have to be able to rub his awful finger under the guy's nose, like on the stash.  So it just stays there?  Yep.  So it's basically going to scrub soap on his face.  And then I think he's going to do like a booger cracker or something.  Oh, you want to watch his awful boogers, too?  Yeah, this is really skimming me out again. 
[00:40:30]  Why?  I'd rather not speak of it.  All right.  So if you have something good you want to do for MiFi, you've got to get a hold of us through the old e-mail.  How about this?  Here's to eat one of Voss's boogers off a little one-inch cube of banana.  That sweetens it up a little too much.  Yeah, you're right.  That makes it easy.  Maybe on a little, like, cracker or something.  I think a little quarter of a Ritz cracker.  Or on a little weedy.  Yep.  Get a little weedy.  A weedy.  And you don't need the weedy.  Just tip it back like a clam.  And you suck it down.  All right.  You're getting people sick. 
[00:41:00]  So we did cherry darts for MiFi on Friday.  It was a huge success.  We had a couple porn stars in here, Star and Candy.  Yes.  And they were completely nude on our lesbian couch over there.  And they had their balloon knots in full view of our fine contestants.  Yeah, they were kneeling on the couch with their heads kind of over the back end of the couch.  So it revealed a beautiful target for our contestants to shoot the cherry darts at.  And they were shooting at their little balloon knots. 
[00:41:30]  And we did come up with a winner.  What the hell is his name?  He was our only black listener, right?  Justin.  Justin.  Common name for a black guy?  Yeah.  We were amazed at the...  Nice guy.  Won the whole contest.  Yeah.  No, he did great.  And he won his MiFi.  It was an exciting finish, too.  Very close.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  And Candy, we all took a liking to Candy, I believe.  Nothing wrong with Star.  She's...  She had a husband with her.  Oh, really?  Yeah, with a big mule, apparently.  Oh, that was the problem.  I just wasn't into it because she wasn't as hot as Candy. 
[00:42:00]  Really?  I liked her.  Candy was very young.  Candy's only been in the porn business three months.  She was tight.  She was 20 years old from Cleveland.  And her fantasy is to film a porno with midgets.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And so far, I went through about 500 to 600 emails over the weekend.  Not one midget wants to do a porn star and be famous in this movie.  Watched a show on midgets over the weekend, by the way.  Yeah.  It was on, I think, HBO On Demand or something.  And it was a whole show.  They show four midgets. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  And what their lives are like.  One guy's a caretaker, kind of clean-up guy at some, I don't know, one of those boarding  houses.  Like a bed and breakfast.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  And his life is just a living hell.  And another guy's an orthopedic surgeon.  A pediatric orthopedic surgeon.  And he's a doctor.  You know, he gets his little midget hands.  I've seen that guy.  He stands up on the little stool and does his thing.  Another one was a girl that decided to get her legs and arms stretched surgically over 
[00:43:00]  the course of years and years.  Like, I don't know, she was 11 when they started and 17 when they finished.  Yeah.  They got those metal things on or whatever.  They put these big brackets around their legs, break the bone.  Yeah.  And then they just slowly twist it a centimeter every week or so.  A little quarter turn of a screw every day.  Oh, it's every day.  Yeah.  But it's a little like nothing a day.  What they do is break the bone.  And then as the bone's trying to heal, you keep spreading the break apart a little bit  at a time.  So it's constantly trying to regrow the bone to connect itself with the other half that's 
[00:43:30]  constantly going away.  And how many inches did she gain?  She grew a foot.  A foot.  So she was a fidget.  Was that the same special with the truck driver that did the same thing?  No.  And he looks all weird now because they were able to add a foot onto him as well.  It wasn't the same show.  It was the one, though, with the woman that's short even for dwarfs.  Yeah.  And her fingers were just a mess.  They also have this problem, that's why their fingers are so weird, where the joints are 
[00:44:00]  fused and the thumb is called floating.  It doesn't do anything.  It just hangs there.  So they've got to grab things between their pointer and middle finger.  And she was about two feet tall.  And she was dating a guy who's about four foot eleven.  Yeah, he was really short.  He never felt like a man before until he met this little tall abortion.  And this is the beauty.  I was watching this with Bob Kelly in his apartment.  Oh, boy.  That must have been fun.  And what happened was the guy asked her to marry him in front of her family.  And she, of course, got excited. 
[00:44:30]  And she went, oh!  And her little arms flailed back and forth.  And she hugged him.  And they went to his shoulder.  She couldn't hug him.  And I look over at this awful Mexican Bob Kelly.  And he's crying.  Stop it.  I wanted to bite his nose off and spit it in his face.  He was crying.  Crying.  Crying.  When I was watching it last night, I was tearing up also.  But it was from laughing so hard.  It's the exact part you're talking about.  She goes, oh!  And you know how a girl, you ask her to marry you. 
[00:45:00]  You've seen this on TV shows.  They put their hands in front of their mouths and go, oh, my God.  And they're like, they're blotting tears from their eyes.  And they grab their face.  This girl, she could not get her hands to her face.  Her arms are too short.  So picture her arms trying to get to her face.  They're about shoulder level, just shaking.  These little, meaty palms.  She looks like a baby T-Rex.  Yeah, a little baby T-Rex.  A stuffed animal T-Rex. 
[00:45:30]  Oh!  Those puffy hands and the little nubbin fingers of hers.  With those little disgusting nails at the end that she has done at the manicures.  That you know when she goes in to have her nails done, the person goes, oh, I've got to hold that mitt for an hour and take care of this.  They're just these little nubs coming off of this muffin.  Little Disney character hands.  Yeah, exactly.  Little fat Mickey Mouse fingers. 
[00:46:00]  There should just be three fingers and a thumb there.  What they should do is wrap her hand up with duct tape so no one has to look at it.  Here, just point at what you need, stupid.  We'll get it for you.  And she drove a car.  She actually drove a car and they had these huge pedal extenders because her feet barely, barely came off the edge of the seat.  Like her ankles were at the edge of her car seat.  So these pedals had to come all the way up to where your crotch would be.  A normal person would be.  That's where her pedals were. 
[00:46:30]  She's driving a car.  The sickest little show.  I was laughing.  I howled.  And Bob Kelly was crying.  He dropped a tear, this emotional boob.  She was just so happy to be getting married.  And I'm howling at those little butterfly wing arms.  Just like old hummingbird wing arms.  Just back and forth.  That's right, you little thing that should have been hangered when you were first conceived.  Fly away.  You'll fly back to school now.  I'm seeing laughs from thalidomide babies at her little arms. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, she really should be behind a dumpster in a Planned Parenthood.  Oh, sorry.  Anyway, okay.  So we're talking about Candy, the porn star, the 20-year-old porn star.  She's in the business only three months so far.  She wants to film this porno with midgets.  Yeah.  Like kind of a Snow White thing in Central Park.  Right.  And have a bunch of midgets bang her.  How cool would that be to watch?  I don't have enough confidence in our radio show.  I said, we will cast this porno for you. 
[00:47:30]  Do you think many midgets?  We will find midgets that will bang you.  Do you think they listen to this program or would listen after one of those little...  I'm thinking the friends of the midgets, though.  You're thinking the friends of the midgets?  They will get the job done for us.  They're truly friends of the midgets?  Do you think they're listening to this?  Hey, let's be honest, man.  I think we're turning off the midget demo.  Pretty much everyone wanted to bang Candy.  I mean, she was just unbelievably hot.  You know, she's not worn out yet like most porn stars that come marching through here. 
[00:48:00]  Still perky?  Still very perky.  I mean, she was a mere teenager only three, four months ago, Anthony.  20 years old, right.  Yeah.  Everything looked A-OK on her.  Lovely.  Mm-hmm.  So now I've got to rewind a little bit.  So the show Friday was a success, and then I got on the phone with Washington to kind of  discuss the free play week.  Like, they're all nervous that we're going to have, like, you know, live sex acts and  all sorts of stuff on the program.  Yeah.  The phone meetings are great with that. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, God.  Because they try to be nice.  Yeah.  They don't want to.  I think they're a little frightened, and they're trying to be diplomatic at the same  time.  They're paranoid that we're going to say fuck a lot.  Yeah, but we're not.  They're paranoid about that.  They're paranoid about live sex acts.  They just don't want the live sex.  So instead of going, guys, free play week, just knock it off with the live sex.  Hey, guys.  We're all there.  Hi.  How you doing?  Welcome.  Glad you could take time out from your schedules for this meeting.  We just want to talk a little bit about the free play week, and we've been teeing some 
[00:49:00]  stuff up, and we just think perhaps we could keep a little more creativity in the program  without having to go to certain areas of the show that you do occasionally go to.  You guys are very clever.  Clever.  Talented.  Maybe this week would be the week where you show off your cleverness.  Right.  Right.  Shut up.  Be a little more clever.  Right.  Maybe be a little funnier. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because that's easy to do.  They just don't want sex.  We'll just be funnier this week.  Because being funny is just so easy.  And believe me, only the Opie and Anthony show, only the Opie and Anthony show would  even get people telling us to comment down on satellite radio.  It's satellite radio.  It's satellite radio.  This is where there is no FCC.  It's the Wild West.  Well, they feel that because they open the channel to everyone, that some people are going 
[00:50:00]  to just kind of, their elbows are going to hit their XM satellite radio, and by accident  it's going to go on 202, and we're going to be in the middle of some crazy sex act.  And then, of course, the mom who's driving the minivan is going to have the kids in the  back car.  Can't believe what she's hearing.  It's going to take her at least five minutes to turn the channel, and by that time, all  the damage done to the kid, and now it's our problem, and XM satellite radio's problem.  Mommy, I want hooker.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Nothing worse than when your kids are listening to that type of talk, and you're outside the  van as it rolls backwards on the dock.  Right down a little boat ramp.  Yeah, blame us for that one, too.  So they had to give us the talk on Friday.  You know, it's the free play week, very important for you guys and the company, so maybe if you  could kind of keep it a little more highbrow than usual.  And what we told them was, yeah, we'll think about it.  Yeah, perfect answer.  We didn't say yes or no.  We'll think about it.  Think about it, which means we will do the show that we know how to do. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, if something comes up, you know, we're going to do it.  So then the discussion goes to the show that we don't talk about anymore.  How long have we been here?  Two months?  Two months, and we have one of those already?  We already have a show that we do not talk about anymore.  Eek.  And the big discussion was, you guys, we don't want you getting the interns laid anymore.  Yeah.  I can't believe someone has to have this discussion with us. 
[00:51:30]  Two months in.  Two months in.  Guys, we are outraged down here in Washington.  We could not believe what we were hearing.  And as we move forward, we want to make a new rule.  You cannot get the interns laid anymore on your program.  Ouch.  Why?  I guess they have a problem with that in the work environment.  Because I guess technically they're employees.  I don't know.  Are they employees?  Why can't we get our interns laid?  That's like a great fringe benefit.  Sure.  If you're shooting for an internship at the Opie and Anthony show, just the possibility 
[00:52:00]  that they may get you laid is kind of cool, I'm thinking.  You don't get that at other places.  You don't get that at IBM?  No.  You won't.  Fill in stupid company here.  I went with IBM.  That's a good one.  Yeah?  I should have said Apple or something.  No, IBM is fine.  Those boys down at IBM are counting on us.  The Captain Hook uniform.  So, you know, I'm never going to say what happened on the show that we can't talk about  anymore.  I don't know if the intern actually got action.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  I have no idea.  I certainly don't know if I got any action in the other room after. 
[00:52:30]  Don't know that at all.  Right.  I was looking at that couch, and an intern was in here, a girl was in here, but I don't  know what was happening.  And quite honestly, after the show, I have no idea what happened.  I don't either.  I didn't see it for myself.  So, it's just all talk.  I had no idea what happened.  I was too busy fielding everyone's phone calls.  Oh, my God.  Dude, we're screwed, right?  Dude, we're screwed, right?  I just flashed back to 2002. 
[00:53:00]  Dude, what do you think?  Oh, what do I think?  I think we're fired again.  Yeah, that's what I think.  That was a phone call.  I was at the diner, and I called Anthony, and he did say these words, we are so fired.  Yeah.  I had to walk out of the diner, because we were sitting down, and I had to take a dump,  and I swear to God, I was so upset, I'm like, I'm going to shit my pants at the diner, at  the table.  Just from being upset.  Just from being so annoyed in the filthy bathroom, I had to go home.  Yeah.  Ben, could I have the Lysol, please?  Did you fart already? 
[00:53:30]  No.  No, no.  I did not.  This, it's the megaphone.  Oh, my God.  It has bad breath on it?  It smells like I was talking with my ass.  I think it's from the onion bagel.  Like, I can't talk into it right after I eat an onion bagel.  Stop licking the megaphone.  That's awful.  You ever scrape your tongue with your fingernail and sniff it?  Oh, I try not to.  No.  All right.  So, that discussion was had.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Smells like the Don Geronimo microphone. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Doesn't smell that bad.  Who's he?  Someone from our past or something?  I don't know who he is.  So, we had that discussion, Anthony, and they were like, please, do not get the interns  late anymore.  And little did I know, as I'm having that discussion and saying, yeah, no problem, we  got it all under control up here.  Our own intern was banging one of the porn stars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, I guess we could discuss this on the air, because it did happen off hours. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  It did happen when, after all the microphones were turned off.  Yes.  And the lights were turned off in the studio, and everyone went home.  It's on his own time.  And I don't think it was on his own time, and I don't think it, yeah, yeah.  But it didn't happen on the premises, right?  Didn't happen on the premises.  Didn't interfere with his job?  No, not at all.  So, what happened was, after the show, or near the, I guess during the last hour of  the show, as Candy's in the studio all hot and naked and stuff, she's like, oh my god, 
[00:55:00]  your intern Noah is so cute.  So cute.  I want to do him.  Well, you've got to give her that.  He is a dish.  She's knowledgeable.  That kid's got a smile on him.  I'm just saying.  And so I didn't think anything of it, and I just kind of, we went across the street,  had some breakfast, and I guess at that point you were, like, hooking up with her or whatever?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I want to, I think I should take this time to thank you guys for giving me the opportunity 
[00:55:30]  to work at the Opie and Anthony show.  How does the intern get to bang the porn star?  Well, she took a liking to him.  Where did the banging take place?  It's my place.  I live across the river.  Jersey.  Jersey.  So she went home with you and you got to bang a porn star?  Yeah, we were hanging out for most of the weekend.  Most of the weekend?  Yeah.  The whole weekend?  Yeah.  She's a good kid.  Good kid.  No, we had a good time.  Dude, you banged the 20-year-old hot, I've only been in the business three months porn star from 
[00:56:00]  Cleveland.  Yeah.  And you're taking my coffee order today?  I think I should be getting him coffee.  No.  I look at him differently today.  He's not just the guy that gets coffee.  No.  He's the guy that bangs hot porn stars.  Banging a porn star.  I've never banged a hot porn star.  Have you, Anthony?  No, I can't say I ever had a porn star.  Was the pressure on knowing that she's a professional?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It took me a little bit to get into the scenario.  Really?  Once or twice, I'd say, before you're really there.  Yeah, I was happy with the merchandise and the performance.  Seems like she's all right. 
[00:56:30]  You know, she seems like she had a good time.  We talk.  I wonder if we should get her on the phone.  We got her phone number.  She sent some emails, actually, to you guys thanking you for the opportunity to be here  and have a good time.  Opportunity to have sex with you.  Yeah.  Thanking us for being able to bang our intern.  That's so funny because she is a porn star.  I don't think I could bang a porn star.  She is in porno movies.  But the fact is, she's also a 20-year-old girl that wanted to hook up with someone she  found attractive here. 
[00:57:00]  Dude, she's a nympho.  You can just tell by looking at her.  Oh, yeah.  When she grabbed Norton's crotch, she just went flush in the face.  She was just...  That was probably revulsion and hatred.  She wanted action right at that moment.  Well, apparently not.  Not that kind of action.  Not Jim Norton action.  So did she teach you any new tricks?  Oh, it was...  I mean, it was a lot of fun.  It was definitely, like, probably the best sex I've ever had.  Wow.  Did you wear a bag?  Oh, yeah.  No, we're very safe.  We're very safe.  Why?  Or a bag.  You hear?  Well, no, I did actually... 
[00:57:30]  We're now going out.  We're very safe.  She had her paperwork in her purse, actually.  So, I mean, like, I saw it.  The AIDS test paperwork?  Yeah, all that stuff.  She just...  When was it done?  Last month.  Last month.  She just carries around her AIDS paperwork?  All girls that could do.  They do.  And you got her number in your cell phone.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  I don't have paperwork.  I just carry around a picture of a girl I fucked six months ago.  Look, she's not thin.  She looks healthy.  So, it took a while to... 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, get into the game.  Because, yeah, you know, there's a lot of pressure there.  There's a lot of pressure there.  Well, of course.  You got to look at some of the films that she's been in.  And the guys that she's with.  You're talking, you know, the baby's arm clutching an apple kind of manhood.  And then, you know, was she open, let's just say, read between the lines,  was she open to all forms of sex?  She was, yes, she's experienced.  Experienced?  Did you, let's just say, was there any point in the evening where maybe you were looking at the part on the back of her head? 
[00:58:30]  Well, there was a lot of fun things that went down.  I don't want to be, you know, too graphic about it.  Oh, why?  I'm just like a, I'm nothing.  I'm a little nothing.  She's a porn star.  Who cares?  Give us the details.  Yeah, what happened?  No, no, just pretty much, you know, just the basic straight stuff.  Did you do the old dirt road?  She's an exhibitionist, though, and I'm not, absolutely not.  We were going shopping at one point, and she wanted to do something in the basement of, like, a furniture store.  Oh, we think the vestibule of a church is a good place to start for public sex. 
[00:59:00]  Wait, you guys hung out all weekend, went shopping and all that?  A little bit.  And she wanted to have sex in public?  Like a date, I guess.  Yeah, she wanted to do some stuff in public.  It's like a movie.  It's like a movie plot.  What's going on?  They go shopping.  But look at me.  Did you go to F.A.O. Schwartz and the two years kind of do the tap dance on the piano keyboard?  No?  It's sort of the Christmas season, so a little Christmas shopping.  No, actually. 
[00:59:30]  No?  We did not, but yeah.  Did you sing a duet?  Baby, it's cold outside.  What the hell?  Did you fall for her?  No, she's a good kid.  I like her.  She's a good girl, but I mean, like.  No Richard Gere jokes.  How old are you, sir?  23 next week.  23.  She's 20.  Kid.  Oh, okay.  Same birthday as the guy who got hit in the head with a boat, actually.  Oh.  Yeah.  You traded birthdays?  Yeah.  What's your birthday?  We talked.  We left her a voicemail.  Maybe she'll call later today.  We'll get her side of the story, but man. 
[01:00:00]  Did she have the big O?  A couple times.  Supposedly five.  But, you know, she's pierced in all sorts of places, so there's nothing to do with it.  Yeah, how did those work out for you?  I mean, like, I lost my virginity to a girl with multiple piercings, so I'm okay with  that, yeah.  But, like.  Do you think the orgasms were real?  Because, you know, she is an actress, technically.  She's a screamer.  Oh, wait.  I'm not sure if they're still there, but I'm kind of.  Why are you taking your pants off?  Oh, he's not taking his pants off.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  You got, like, scratches and black and blues on your back.  She's brutal. 
[01:00:30]  She was scratching your back like that?  A little violent.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's some, uh, that's some, uh, animal sex.  Yeah, so thanks a lot, you guys.  Appreciate it.  Well, that sounds like a fun time.  You're very, oh, Jesus.  If you want an internship with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I think I might apply for one.  Email bensparks1027 at yahoo.com.  We get our interns laid.  Jeez.  What are you panicking about, Ben?  Nothing.  Oh, we got her?  Ah.  We're just waiting to get her on the phone here. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  This is just, there she is.  All right, hold on.  I got to do this.  Ben was panicking.  Yes.  Candy.  Yes.  What, what the hell happened after the show?  Oh, why don't you have to know about that?  What?  We've been talking about it.  Yeah, he just showed us the, uh, the, the scratch marks on his back.  They haven't healed yet.  Sorry about that.  And, uh, he said you had five orgasms. 
[01:01:30]  Were they real orgasms?  Plenty more than that.  Were they real?  I said plenty more than that.  And they were all real orgasms, huh?  Of course.  Oh.  And, um, and, and he said that you guys wanted to have sex in public at a furniture store?  Or you did, and he said no to that.  He wouldn't let me.  What were you guys doing at a furniture store?  It was like a, we were shopping around town.  They're already shopping for their apartment.  Dining room table?  Well, we could bang on that.  So, Candy, you like Noah, huh?  Very, very much so. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  I think we got a love connection.  How's that going to work out if you're a porn star?  Um, how isn't that going to work out?  I can come visit.  So this isn't something that's, uh, you know, one and done?  You guys might, uh, see each other again?  Oh, we will definitely be seeing each other again.  Yeah, I hope so.  This is like a plot for a movie.  Porn star bangs intern.  What, uh, what are your feelings there, Noah?  Are you a little nervous maybe about getting, uh, attracted to her a little more?  Actually.  Do you see each other a little more? 
[01:02:30]  Maybe her lifestyle?  Yeah, I thought about it.  I thought about that.  And, you know, Richard Gere jokes aside, like, nah, I'm fine with that whole scenario.  You got a gerbil in your ass?  Yes.  Oh, I thought the other Richard Gere.  Okay, I got you.  Candy, so how does he rate as far as his sexual performance?  Excellent.  And you've banged a few professionals in your time, in your short time, right?  Plenty of professionals.  And Noah knows what he's doing, huh?  Noah is absolutely amazing.  Did you teach him anything new?  Any new tricks? 
[01:03:00]  We'll get there.  We'll get there?  I have only had two games with him.  Wait, you didn't?  How many different positions did you guys try?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Very straight and narrow.  Oh.  For now.  I'm waiting for, uh, after the AVN.  We'll end up breaking it.  Don't worry.  What?  I said, we'll end up breaking Noah.  Don't worry.  Okay, and, uh, I guess, I don't know.  As far as, like, how he rates with other porn stars, is our boy packing or what?  He is very, very well endowed.  Oh! 
[01:03:30]  The mule update.  Wow.  I'm, like, blushing.  I can't take this.  All right, well.  You have some blood that can go to your face?  I'm left in that body of yours?  Wow.  Oh, all right, well.  So, it looks like you enjoyed your time in New York there, Candy.  Very, very much so.  And you pretty much spent the whole weekend with Noah.  Yeah, so until the time I left, I was there as much as possible unless I had to work. 
[01:04:00]  Unless I had to work.  Yeah, that.  What kind of work did you have to do in New York?  Well, what kind of work do you think?  Wow, so wait a minute.  She was at your place, Noah, right?  And you guys are hanging out, shopping for furniture, having sex.  And then all of a sudden, a beeper or a phone goes off.  And she goes, I gotta go to work.  I gotta go.  So, you go, bye, honey.  And she leaves.  And then she comes back how much later?  An hour or two.  An hour or two later.  About an hour and 20 minutes, I'm thinking. 
[01:04:30]  Ten minute cab ride to and fro.  Have you made a romantic path of rose petals to the shower for her to follow?  Sometimes they just talk about football, Anthony.  Yeah, the rose petals were from the front door of his apartment right to the shower.  Right to the shower.  And then, oh, but sometimes they just talk about football.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  It's just, you know, hanging out, having a burger.  What kind of furniture were you shopping for?  Mouthwashing a bidet? 
[01:05:00]  Wow, that is something.  You know what it is?  I know what it is now.  It's absolutely risky business.  It's the movie risky business.  That's what was going on, actually.  He's in the house, hanging out with the chick.  She's still got work to do.  Were you jamming your Tangerine Dreams greatest hits CDs?  Did you slide in on your socks, wearing only your underwear, and do a little dance? 
[01:05:30]  A little Bob Seger in the background?  There it is.  Here comes Noah sliding in.  Yeah!  Look, Noah's dancing.  He's getting the apartment all set while she's out with some other guy.  Went to the furniture store to find something to put that big glass egg on.  Sure!  Parents are away.  Guido the killer pimp.  Did you drive the Porsche around? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God.  Lease.  Lease.  Right, okay.  Oh, very good.  So she went to work.  How many times did she go to work?  Once.  No, she left on Friday night for most of the night, and then once on Saturday.  So she came back Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon?  No, Saturday.  Well, Saturday we spent most of the day together, and she had to leave for most of the evening,  and then she came back later at night.  Actually, twice she came back, didn't you?  Yeah, twice.  Was there any jealousy going on in your head, knowing that, you know, none?  No.  No jealousy.  No, we're no illusions here. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Work is work, my dear.  Absolutely.  That boy has no illusions.  God, this is a great story.  All right.  Well, thank you, Candy.  Anything else you want to add?  What did you do when she was gone?  Yeah, really cleaned up, I think.  Put things back in place, moved the bed back to the wall.  Hanging around the house, looking at his wash.  Called the 1-800-AIDS hotline just to make sure everything's okay.  Sorry.  Hi, Candy. 
[01:07:00]  No again.  I'm leaving a message.  Can you call them?  I don't know.  Hope everything's going good at work.  I miss you.  I miss you.  I miss you.  Can you call me on the break?  Call me back.  I'm just, I'm at the house, you know.  Just call me.  Okay, bye.  Hi, Candy.  No again.  I'm leaving a message.  Boy, you've been at work for a while.  Just wondering if you're coming back.  Chinese tonight?  Uh, okay, give me, give me a call back. 
[01:07:30]  I'm, uh, just a little worried about you.  You know.  All right, baby.  I'll talk, I'll talk to you later.  It wasn't anything like that?  You weren't thinking you should call her or something?  No, sir.  Make sure she's okay?  It's rude.  Because, you know, there's some riffraff out there that, you know, it's almost like, uh,  it's almost like going out with a cop or something.  A cop has to go out on the job?  You don't know.  Maybe that's the night. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  You know?  So, well, thank you, Candy.  We might call you back, all right?  Because this story's still developing, obviously.  That's perfectly fine, dear.  And we're still looking for midgets for your porno, okay?  Please do so.  And I will talk to all of you soon.  And have Noah call me when he gets a second.  All right.  Oh, I will.  I'll talk to you soon, Candy.  Bye, boys.  Bye.  All right.  Why don't you go talk to Candy?  Because now I'm going to do the second half of the story, which makes it even better.  Which makes it even more brutal.  She pretty much just admitted that she was, look, she wasn't filming a movie in New York City. 
[01:08:30]  No.  She was making some extra cash.  Making some cash.  Spending a little time with some gentlemen.  Right.  So now it's like open game.  Yeah.  No, Ben, you don't even know the half of it.  No, you have no idea.  Ben's laughing already.  He's laughing at Jimmy, but he doesn't even know the half of it.  This is where, this is the portion of the show where we prove that Jim Norton's life is truly pathetic.  Like, just like he's been telling us for years. 
[01:09:00]  Everyone thinks I exaggerate.  And people don't understand that from head to toe, I am garbage.  This, I will be Bob Kelly with a tear dripping down my eye for this story because it is sad.  Anyone else notice that Norton had nothing to say to Candy?  Nothing.  Well, I didn't want to, again, I don't C-block other guy.  Of course.  And if he's got a thing going, it's like, I'm not going to jump in and say something stupid to ruin the mood.  If you were listening to Cherry Darts on Friday, it was obvious that...  Plus, you didn't mention it.  That's why I didn't mention it.  Yeah, I know.  Well, now it's time to mention it. 
[01:09:30]  We were going to mention it anyway.  I wasn't going to let this one slide.  You shouldn't.  No effing way.  Anyway, so it was pretty obvious that a lot of people took a liking to Candy because she's  young, she's hot, she's only been in porn a few months, and she's obviously a nympho.  She took a liking to Noah.  But there's no secret when a girl comes in here, Norton will kind of feel these girls  out and also feel them up.  Oh, cut it out, Hope!  And we got Candy to, you know, mess with Norton's mule and stuff a few times during the show. 
[01:10:00]  Through the pants.  And Norton was thinking there may be something there because she did get all, you know, flushed  after she touched your mule.  You were thinking maybe that I might be able to get something going on here.  But not the way you think.  What do you mean?  I was, we were joking around about, like, oh yeah, he likes to, Norton likes to go out  and pay for girls.  And she's like, well, come on, kind of like a joke.  Right.  But I knew it wasn't a joke. 
[01:10:30]  So I was under no illusions that, like, ooh, I think she likes me.  I never make that error.  Okay, okay.  Ever.  Well, I forget we're dealing with a professional as far as, as far as call girls go.  But I also know Jimmy might, Jimmy might ask a girl, hey, you want to go out for a cup  of coffee or something, just to maybe get to know her a little better.  Yeah, at times, yeah, sure.  But you weren't thinking that with her or anything?  No, I didn't get those vibes off her.  I immediately knew, like, you know, like, she's like, I'm a nympho, but I never really  believed her.  I know it's all about business.  Yeah.  At least the relation with me was about business, and that was perfectly acceptable.  As far as I was concerned.  All right. 
[01:11:00]  So, um...  She spent the weekend with Noah, though, and no money was exchanged there.  Of course not, no.  She spent it because she found him attractive, and they spent the whole weekend having sex,  shopping.  Having free sex, Anthony.  Free sex.  Candy the porn star had free sex with our roley intern.  Right.  Who's pretty much a nothing, trying to, you know, learn about radio and things like that.  No offense to Noah.  Knock a man down.  No offense to Noah.  He's still a young guy, and he's, you know, he's growing and learning every day.  Mm-hmm.  Um, Norton wanted to have sex with Candy as well. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, why not?  And how much was it going to cost you?  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Oh, boy.  I'll let you know.  I never...  Before Norton said, I just want to make it perfectly clear, lowly intern Noah, free  sex.  Free sex all weekend long.  All weekend long with hot 20-year-old porn star Candy.  Free sex all weekend long.  So much sex that he's saying no to sex in bathrooms in public.  Right. 
[01:12:00]  Scratches down his back.  He's getting so much sex.  There was a point where he had to say no mocks.  No, not in the basement at the furniture store.  Right.  Well.  As the day was progressing, she was indicating that she liked Noah.  You could tell that she liked him.  Yeah.  And so I was going to ask for her number just to conduct some business.  Uh-huh.  But him and her were kind of talking, and to me that would have been like a C-block move. 
[01:12:30]  Not that she would have went for me over him, but that kind of adds a bad vibe if you're  in the studio and everybody's like a vulture.  Sure.  So I was like, ah, you know, let it go.  I'll talk to Joe later and see if she maybe wants to talk to me later.  But I didn't want to make her uncomfortable because she seemed to have a vibe going with  Noah.  I'm not a blocker.  I hate cock-blocking guys.  Absolutely.  So I talked to Joe after.  I'm like, hey, man, just call Candy.  I would like to talk to her if she wants to.  If she doesn't tell her it's cool, no one's uncomfortable, whatever, just give her my number.  And so he talked to me like hours later. 
[01:13:00]  So much for not whoring, by the way.  I'm a weak man.  Remember you were swearing off that?  I wanted to feel it out.  So Joe calls me.  He goes, look, man, I don't know the deal.  She said you could call her.  He's like, I really don't know if she likes it or not.  I'm not sure.  I'm like, yeah, no problem.  He stayed out of it.  So I gave her a jingle.  You called her up?  Right after she got back from good old New Jersey.  And I'm like, yeah, when did you when did you call her?  Like, exactly what day and time was it?  It was Friday.  It was sometimes she had just come back in a jersey, obviously from having a lot of young sex. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to think what was happening while you called her.  Was she actually with?  No, no, no, no, no.  I believe she answered the phone.  She had just had free sex with him and left.  She probably got the call from Joe knowing that I wanted to talk to her,  but probably couldn't jot the number down because her mouth was all full of young intern mule.  Young intern mule.  Not a thought of a buck in her head.  Not a thought of 15 years slaving in this motherfucking business. 
[01:14:00]  Not one thought.  Not one thought about a social life thrown out to be good in comedy.  Not one thought.  Why would you think about that when there's abs and a smile?  Why would you?  You might as well add that you were on VH1 this past weekend.  Oh, who cares?  MTV pilots, the Opie and Anthony show, the Tonight Show does it.  None of it needs that.  You had a quick scene in Spider-Man. 
[01:14:30]  You know, I guess.  It is as meaningless as I've been telling you for all these years.  It's drivel.  So we chat briefly on the phone.  The only thing Noah has going for him is good DNA.  Good looking guy.  Very handsome guy.  And a nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  I like Noah.  You've got a great resume.  He's got good DNA.  Yeah.  I have a mediocre resume and he has great DNA.  But it's one of many times I've lost to good looking guys.  It's just the way it goes.  So she gave you a jingle back?  Well, no.  She actually answered when I called. 
[01:15:00]  So I'm talking to her for a second.  I'm like, so how you doing?  She's like, cool.  I'm like, yeah, I would like to hang.  She's like, well, that could be arranged, which I immediately like.  Talk business.  Business.  Yeah, I'm not some dummy who's like, please, I'm 36 and she's 20.  This is what made me want to just spit peas at her.  I'm like, all right, well, let's talk about it.  And she's like, well, I'm working for so-and-so.  And she quoted the price.  I almost threw the phone out the window.  She wanted a grand.  Oh, Jesus.  That she was given the intern.  A grand to have sex with her.  That she was given the intern for free. 
[01:15:30]  Well, no.  To be fair.  The intern.  I said, look, that can't happen.  It's too much.  And then to be fair, she did say that she would do it for $500.  Which is quite a break.  When you think of the 23-year-old good-looking guy getting it for free.  All weekend, by the way.  All weekend.  Not just an hour of her time.  Not just one load from you.  Like a free play.  Right.  It was a free play weekend.  Could you find out how many times Noah had sex for free with the porn star?  I really want to rub this in today. 
[01:16:00]  Because I'm such an ass.  Maybe add it up in dollars and cents.  Right.  How much free sex he did get.  Oh, as opposed to how much it was.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  It would have run.  It cost me a pretty penny.  Oh.  And Ben.  Ben talking for the first time in a week.  Yes, sir.  Six times.  All right.  Wow.  So even with a discounted rate, that would have been $3,000 for her to put herself through  the torture of sleeping with awful Jim Norton.  For an hour.  That's the only...  I don't know.  Well, it's... 
[01:16:30]  Oh, it's for an hour.  Hour.  It's not kidding.  For an hour.  For an hour.  But, you know, yeah, it's one load, though, usually, right?  Well, they call it cups in the business.  They could have one or two cups.  Cups.  I don't know how they work it.  Cups.  An hour for me.  I've never gotten off more than one.  For me, as soon as it's done, beat it.  So that's why...  That's where he's doing the math.  So what would it cost him $3,000?  The only thing that annoyed me...  It wasn't the money issue.  That's fine.  It was the amount that she wanted.  It's like, are you fucking crazy?  You were just in here.  It's like...  You know something?  It's like...  We shared something professionally. 
[01:17:00]  It's like, how about a little discounted rate?  It's like the guy you know with the car dealer.  If you tell me $1,500 is discounted, I'll vomit on my own shoes.  That's not a discount.  You think I don't know how the business works?  You're quote high.  You don't know how much money the guy has.  Right.  I'll do it for $500.  But you know, you could have...  She could have...  If she would have said $200 for just a little bit, not $4,000, I would have said, yeah,  all right.  So it wasn't the amount that she wanted to charge you.  That I really didn't care about.  I don't take that person.  She was like a businessman that you've done business with him before, which is what she  did here on our show. 
[01:17:30]  And then taking care of you, like I said, at the car dealership, the guy goes, hey, I  could give you a little off on this.  Absolutely.  And she was so repulsed that she could not even bring it down to a normal rate.  And she couldn't even think in business terms of the amount of plugs I would have  given her.  I would have been Pete Plug.  All I would have talked about...  Unfortunately, she was horrified by the one plug you would have given her.  That the other ones didn't really matter anymore.  And as revolting as this is, it's almost good because I tell you, people think I'm 
[01:18:00]  exaggerating or I'm crazy.  It is exactly the way things are.  I completely understand and I feel for you, Jimmy.  Don't.  It's just my life.  No, I do.  I'm one of my 36.  This type of stuff has been going on since probably the age of 12.  Right now, I am Bob Kelly and you are that little midget with the hands flailing in  front of you.  Oh, she likes me.  Oh, my God.  Free for the intern.  $1,000 discounted to $500.  That's what... 
[01:18:30]  It's just a kick to the old fat appendix scar stomach.  Now, I understand how you operate sometimes and something like this could really throw Jimmy  for a loop.  Jimmy's an emotional guy sometimes.  These things get to him.  How did you then deal with this sort of rejection for the rest of your weekend?  Well, I handled it pretty well considering that night I finally called one of my regulars.  I did break down.  You did break down.  Broke down.  I told you I'd be honest when I did, if I did.  So how many days did you last? 
[01:19:00]  Maybe a week.  A week.  Oh, yeah.  I think it was last Monday, right?  About a week.  About a week.  You know what the good thing is, though?  What?  You did save yourself some cash.  I saved myself a lot of cash.  It's not like if you fall off the wagon and go to a whore that you then have to pay the  whores that you would have slept with.  You know, that money is money in the bank.  And the girl I wound up hooking up with is a girl I've hooked up with many times.  She might be...  She's definitely in the top three.  She might be the best I've ever...  So this one...  Wow.  It was fine.  Yeah.  It's not...  If I could see her just like once in a while, I'd be totally cool with it.  It's my obsession.  Because then the next night, I'm at the Comedy Cellar. 
[01:19:30]  And who comes down but my friend Dennis Hoff, who owns the Bunny Ranch.  He's a good buddy of mine.  That's a good buddy to have.  He's going to invite me out for a year.  I haven't been able to go.  We're going to do a contest with him.  And he goes, hey, man.  We hang out for a while.  I'm going to drop him off at his hotel.  And he goes, hey, man.  I know this real cheap place.  Let me treat you.  Now, who can say no to a treat?  A treat?  What am I?  Insulting?  No.  So we go.  I didn't like the vibe of this place, though.  It was upstairs.  It was like three guys that could have been Latin kings or Mexican mafia guys just sitting up there.  But I wind up going into the room with some southern girl, Dennis Pays. 
[01:20:00]  And she performs rather toothy oral treats on me.  But I tipped her 50 to take the bag off.  And she drooled into my ass crack like that little shorthanded nothing playing harmonica.  That's what it was like.  That little midget.  Woo!  Those little arms.  She should have been playing harmonica over my balls.  That's how it would have been.  That's what it looked like.  Oh, man.  And the only part with this girl I didn't like was I went to kiss her shoulder and it smelled like somebody's bad breath. 
[01:20:30]  Like, obviously, some dirtbag had been in there licking her shoulders.  You had the same idea.  Yeah.  Apparently, I'm not Ralph Romantic.  I thought that was my original idea.  No.  That's unbelievable.  Some mess had been there before you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and I had rejection all weekend.  I'll tell you more.  I don't know when we're going to break.  I have to urinate very badly.  But I had more rejection.  I have to urinate really bad, too.  Did you have professional rejection also or something?  You said that.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, we'll go.  I want to get to this thing first.  I thought he was upset at the Billy Crystal thing you went to.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  That's all.  Yeah.  See, some stuff like that.  There's all kinds of devastation in his life this weekend.  I feel bad for Jimmy.  We do want to talk about that.  But I want to play the phone call from Jim's mom, everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Do we have to do this now?  Can I pee?  I wish Kiss would come in to hold you after this weekend.  Oh, I really could use it right now.  It's not even been a bad on the outside weekend.  You look at it, and you go, ah, so what?  Your life is good?  My life is good.  But it's just these things are confirmations of what I already know.  Do you understand what I mean?  It's almost like if you think you're the werewolf. 
[01:21:30]  No, you're not a werewolf.  You're a good person.  And then you wake up with, like, blood under your fingernails and a little fur on your pillow.  It's just not devastating in itself, but you know you're a werewolf.  You just know you're a werewolf.  For me, it's the same thing, except I'm shit.  You start feeling good about yourself, where you are in life, your career, everything that's going on for yourself.  And then something happens where you just, once again, you go, ah, there.  See?  I knew it.  Jimmy Robinson had a point. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  Oh, with his little cape.  Him and Helen were absolutely right.  I hate that kid.  I hate him.  I hate him.  All right, we can do part two after the break.  Yeah, I got to whiz bad.  Let him whiz.  We have a phone call from Jim's mom.  And, honestly, I haven't laughed this hard.  I couldn't tell you.  I listened to the first ten seconds of Jim Norton's mom's phone call to Jim, a concerned parent.  I had to stop the tape, and I had to laugh for about ten straight minutes. 
[01:22:30]  Nice, wonderful lady.  A lot like my mother, the way she talks to her son about things.  Very loving.  Very concerned, loving.  And then, you know, your son is Jimmy.  Or your son is the guy that made a couple have sex in a church.  Yeah.  It's just those instances where your mom can just remain so sweet, trying to guide you, and you're just a piece of crap.  Well, as a parent, how do you acknowledge to yourself that you did your best, and the thing that you sweated for your whole life still likes to lie on the floor with bags and have his chest shit on? 
[01:23:00]  How do you accept that as a rational, loving parent?  You don't.  You put it in your head, and you try to twist it into something else.  Yeah, that's got to be a real downer.  Your mom left a message on your machine, and she's just casually talking about your whoring.  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  That a mother has to do that.  That a mother has to do that. 
[01:23:30]  And it's the same tone, like, I'm worried about you.  Have you been studying?  Yeah.  Are you the SATs?  Are you eating enough?  Are you getting enough sleep?  Are you taking your vitamins?  It's that same tone, but she's talking about whoring with her son.  It's unbelievable.  The only reason we're not playing it here is because, like Jim said, I have to take a leak like you won't believe.  Let's go together.  All right, we'll go together.  In the meantime, we'll do a little mash-up, a little musical interlude here.  I like this one.  It's the Doors and Blondie getting together. 
[01:24:00]  And we'll continue with Norton's awful life in just a few minutes.  It's the Doors and Blondie getting together.

[01:35:00]  He wasn't able to  You weren't able to  Shake it off?  No, and I could feel  It gets a little chilly  In your underwear  And every time my mule hits it  It feels like cold water  Splashing on me  Getting back to the subject at hand  This is the funny part  Ben comes running in the studio  After that last break  The first email he gets  Is from a guy named Ricky  It just says  Hello Ben  I attached my resume  With the email  Thank you very much  And of course  The subject line says  Internship  Yeah  He wants to be an intern  Well, everyone wants to be an intern 
[01:35:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show  Now that they know  We get you laid  Yeah, but  You know  With hot young porn stars  From Cleveland  There's plenty of interns  Around here that  Didn't go home with candy  Right  You know  Just because you're an intern  Doesn't make a difference  I mean  You know  You have to  She was the one  That was attracted to him  She sure was  Yeah  Let's just say  Noah's not the first intern  That got some action  Because of this radio show  No, of course not  That's all I'm saying  But, you know  $500 
[01:36:00]  There's a whole room full of guys  In there  A whole room full of eager guys  Just waiting for their chance  At the porn star  Yeah  Half a thousand  Half a thousand  And Norton  You know  To bang the same porn star  That the intern did for free  Would have cost the gym  At a reduced rate  $500 an hour  Mm-hmm  Ugh  So the whoring is back on  Nah, I'm gonna try to  Stop that  All kidding aside  Norton is trying to give up  Whoring  Spends a lot of money on it 
[01:36:30]  Right  I want to buy an apartment  Just because  I mean, I'm sick of paying rent  Sometimes you gotta buy  You know, it's like a mortgage  I gotta get a mortgage  And I'm okay  But I don't want to keep  Wasting money  Mm-hmm  So you lasted about a week  This time around  That's not bad  That's a start  Yeah, I suppose so  Because I know you're pretty much  Doing it every night, right?  Yeah  I was on Craigslist last night  So I didn't sleep  I slept till 3 o'clock  Yesterday afternoon  So I do what I normally do  On Sunday nights  Which is just stay up  And I'm online  And I'm actually writing  On my stupid blog finally  And I just  You know, I'm like 
[01:37:00]  I can't go to bed  Alright, so it didn't work out  With Candy  Obviously  So then you had to  Get one anyway  And she was pretty awful  Got two, yeah  No, no, she was great  The one I got was great  Oh, you got two of them  My regular was fantastic  The one Dennis bought me  She was nice  But again, she gave it  She gave it like a nice drool hummer  A little toothy for my taste  But she couldn't even fake  That she was enjoying it  She's so depressed  To be there from the south  Oh, boy  Yeah, I really was  Bummed out with her  Bad breath on her shoulder  From some awful drunk  Who was licking her shoulder 
[01:37:30]  Probably whispering  Mommy  In her ear  Although, let me be honest  If I knew this girl  Was going to run right back  To Noah's place  I would have spent the 500  I absolutely would have  Put a batch in her hair  Oh  Just as a fine  How do you do?  Oh, I would have sent her back  With like Statue of Liberty hair  Is there an awkwardness  Between you and the intern now?  Not at all  Not at all?  No  Between guys like that?  Never  Okay  Absolutely not  So, yeah  The whoring thing  I thought he was gay, actually  Yeah, we all thought that  We all thought he was gay  I'm glad to know he's not 
[01:38:00]  Oh, wow  There was that whole thing going on  We forgot to bring that up  When Candy goes  You know  Wow, that Noah's a cute intern  We're all kind of  No offense, Noah  But we're all kind of laughing  Like, ha, ha, ha  Oh, boy  But that's the whole guy response  To a good-looking guy being around  Yeah  They go, oh, he must be gay  Yeah, we kind of  Not that it matters  We kind of thought  Maybe you were  Really?  No problems here, guys  There are some rumors  Breakout rent boys  Let's hold chapters  Throw them at me 
[01:38:30]  Feeling very confident today  Cocky, if you will  All right, well  We learned a little something about you  Thanks  Not that it matters  But we were thinking  Maybe out of all the interns  That you might have been the one  I'm sure one of them was  You're sure one of them  Oh, man, shaking their heads  I always hope the best-looking one is gay  That's the one you root for  I don't care how much pussy Nathaniel tries to get  Take it out of the mix  That's six-foot-eight  Young Frankenstein-looking psychopath 
[01:39:00]  No one cares about him  Jeez  Just lumbering in there  With, like, a checkered shirt  Actually, it's down in Nathaniel and Derek  Because we know Danny's not either  I'm just saying  We just know  All right  Well, I want to see  I want to see Nathaniel and Derek  Take out their mules  And do a little man-to-man docking  And see who enjoys it that much more  Yeah, just see who gets a rod first  That one would be guilty as charged  If we didn't have the new rule on the show 
[01:39:30]  Where we can't get the interns laid  You know, we would figure something out  Who are we kidding?  We're not listening to the gang in Washington  New rule  All right, so  Yeah, the whoring has become a subject on this show  With Norton  Because he really wants to stop  And I guess your mom and dad  Listen to the program every day  I knew that would be a mistake, too  I knew it  Why?  They listened to the show  When it was for free, didn't they?  Yeah, I know, I know  I just knew it, though  Like, I knew  Yeah  You can't let your parents listen  You know, it's just sex  I've lost from regular girls  Because when I talk about it on the air 
[01:40:00]  When I write on the computer  I mean, it's just  Because no girl wants to date me  After hearing this  How can they?  Well, your mom's very concerned  And she left a little message  On your machine  Yeah  I don't know if I'll be able to play it  All the way through  Yeah  It's just a sweet mother  Concerned about her son  All right, here's the tape  Hi, sweetheart  It's mom  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward  But everyone's fine here  But we heard the radio show 
[01:40:30]  We love it, by the way  And you were talking about  Giving up, you know  Ladies of the evening  Ladies of the evening  This is where I stopped the tape earlier  I'm going to lose it again  Because it's your mom  You know, she doesn't want to say whores  Or hookers  Or ladies of the evening  Ladies of the evening  Like she read that in one of her novels  You know  One of those romantic novels  Where they make everything all nice  I know you're trying to give up 
[01:41:00]  Partaking in the world's oldest profession  Is there any guilt on your part  About what your parents have to think?  Well, I feel bad that I'm so honest  But no, I have no guilt  I love my parents  I get a little great with my parents  No, no  I've hung out with Jimmy's parents  They are the nicest  Oh, yeah  You'll meet as people you'll ever meet  I know, but the fact that they even have to make phone calls like this  Yeah, I do feel a little bad  Not only that  But my mom has to look at her librarian friends 
[01:41:30]  Right  She's a librarian  She's retired  She's a librarian  A librarian  Big eye contact  Oh, your son  Toilet chest  I've got to start this over again  Hi, sweetheart  It's mom  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward  But everyone's fine here  But we heard the radio show  We love it, by the way  And you were talking about giving up  You know, ladies of the evening  Which is a wonderful thing 
[01:42:00]  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says  Replace something with something  Dr. Phil?  How does Dr. Phil get into this?  I don't know  I don't know  Because she's a mom  She watches Dr. Phil  She picks up some tidbits of psychiatry  And decides she's going to help her boy  I have to know what Dr. Phil says about weak-chinned man with fat tits and prostitute habits  What does Dr. Phil say about that?  What would Dr. Phil say there?  Mom  She gets her advice from Dr. Phil 
[01:42:30]  And she's going to pass it along to her little son  Little Jimmy  Get off those ladies of the night  It's a good thing  Keeping it positive  Jimmy Robinson and Helen say  That if you want to replace something  God, am I an ass  You want to replace Monster Rain  Which is a wonderful thing  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says  Replace something with something  So I was thinking  You know, you have that nice gym downstairs  And, you know 
[01:43:00]  Just for like 20 minutes to half an hour  And you would feel better  Use that  And also there's gyms in New York  You could go  Oh, she's trying to kill two birds with one stone here, isn't she?  Yep  There's gyms in New York  A nice gym you have downstairs  Yeah, but a nice gym downstairs  Is there a bang and a hooker for 20 minutes?  Why don't you jump on the treadmill?  Anything could have been downstairs  Zarkawi's beheading equipment  You could go down there 
[01:43:30]  Just lop off the head of an imperialist  Just, you know  Replace it with something  Oh, man  I'm going to be laughing in my sleep  Dr. Phil  You could go  You could exercise  And you would feel a whole lot better  You'd lose a little weight  You'd tone up  And you'd relieve, you know  Tension and stuff  And you'd be meeting other people  I don't know, honey  I just thought it might be a good thing  I'm sorry 
[01:44:00]  I'm interfering, I know  I just  I'm thinking of you  You could work out  Tone up  I wouldn't have to be embarrassed  To be seen with you  Maybe you could not look like  Philip Seymour Hoffman  In Boogie Nights  When you wear a half shirt  She's telling me to tone up  Let's translate that  Maybe if you got on the gym  Noel wouldn't have gotten  A fucker for free  Fat tits  That's what she's saying  Maybe if you had  A little stick-to-itiveness  You wouldn't have to  Cough up 
[01:44:30]  A thousand  Or five hundred  Get off the hooker  Get on a Bowflex  Mom  And she said  You can get rid of some energy  Which I know  What she's saying  Like that energy I have  That goes into bad things  Could be used for  Working out  Lifting a barbell  Tone up a little bit  Lift dumbbells  Don't fuck them  That's what mom 
[01:45:00]  Trying to say  Pick up weights  Don't lose it  Because you have AIDS  I'm drooling  Oh my god  Holy ass  Oh my god  Try the clean and snatch  Not the dirty snatch  Do some rolling  Not hulling  God if I knew more 
[01:45:30]  Gym equipment  I could make this  A bit longer  See  What a lazy  Fat nothing  You gotta get in the gym  Yes  Put a barbell  This bit doesn't need to be longer  It is what it is  Be meeting other people  I don't know honey  I just thought  It might be a good thing  I'm sorry  I'm interfering  I know  I just  I'm thinking of you  Nobody knows I'm calling 
[01:46:00]  So  Don't get offended  Or think I'm strange  But I am a mother  And I worry about you  You're doing so well  Everything's falling into place  This might be just one of the  You know  The health thing  It would help  It would help you sweetheart  Well anyway  That's it  I'm not going to go on and on  I know it's not my business  But anyway  I love you  And I feel I can  Interstick this on your mother  I'm taking a special license  But anyway  We're looking forward  To seeing you at Christmas  And I really hope you can make it  This holiday season  What are you giving

[01:49:00]  Friday I was in a bookstore  I started talking to this very French looking girl  She was a bilingual illiterate  She couldn't read in two different languages  I left the store and went down the street to my bus  My bus came and I got on  I sat down beside this beautiful blonde Chinese girl  I said hello and she said hello and I said isn't it an amazing day?  She said yes it is, I guess  I said what do you mean to guess? 
[01:49:30]  She said well things haven't been going too well for me lately  I said like what?  She said I can't tell you, I don't even know you  I said yeah but sometimes it's good to tell you problems to an absolute total stranger on a bus  She said well I've just come back from my analyst and he's still unable to help me  And I said what's the problem?  And she paused and said  I'm an infomaniac and I only get turned on by Jewish cowboys  And she said by the way my name is Diane 
[01:50:00]  And I said hello Diane I'm Bucky Goldstein  Welcome up next on Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton sings 
[01:50:30]  Forget me not  You're sightless caught  You dog just shit on my rug  Thought that was pretty fucking funny didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show  You don't do sketches stupid  Word up  Word up  Word up  Word up  When you hear them all you got to get it out of the way  Word up  It's a cold word  No matter what you're saying  You know that's over  This is the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:51:00]  The O-N-A virus spreading across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  Another satellite radio article in the New York Daily News today  The Daily News  I see the picture they have used for the last, I don't know, four or five years  You and I, me with my stupid mouth open  And you in the background laughing  Ha ha ha  But another positive article about satellite radio  And how it's going to pretty much just revolutionize how we listen to radio 
[01:51:30]  It'll take over the world  You can read it for yourself, I guess  But it's pretty cool, right?  Yeah  A revolution via satellite radio  Yeah, we made the move to satellite radio and everyone is getting in line and following us  It's pretty cool  That's it  We are the true pioneers  The pioneers  The pioneers  The first real high-profile show to take this leap, Anthony  I remember, Opie, when I had that first soldering iron in my hand and we were soldering together the first satellite radio 
[01:52:00]  I said to you, this is going to be big  You know how pompous we are?  XM Satellite Radio has been at this for a long time  We don't even acknowledge that  Oh, no  Satellite radio started when you and I jumped aboard and started broadcasting October 1st  Before ONA and after ONA  That's right  Before ONA, we could care less about it  That's the dark ages  They were still trying to figure it all out  It's like BC, right  You know?  No one really cares about BC 
[01:52:30]  Oh, dinosaurs are around or something  I don't know  And then, you know, we come aboard and civilization starts  You've got to think that  Us talking about how we're the pioneers of satellite radio  There's got to be a lot of people down in Washington  At the XM facility  They're like, those sons of bitches  I think they're saying that over a few other reasons  We've been slaving with this whole thing for years  Yeah  Getting no recognition  Talking about the launch of the satellites  Where were we?  What?  What were we drinking?  What strip club were we at when the rocket scientists were figuring out how to put satellites in orbit for this place? 
[01:53:00]  You know what?  They did all the heavy lifting for us  And we come in and get all the credit  We came in, okay  It's our mugs they show in every article  Or our little names, Opie and Anthony  It's not the guy that, you know  Decided how the rocket was to be launched  There were guys that worked for XM satellite radio for free  Because they believed in it  Right  Because I think the company went bankrupt a long time ago  No pay  But they still believed in what they were doing  So they started working for free 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  You think those guys are a little pissed off when they hear us say we're the pioneers of satellite radio  Yeah, what do we do?  We come in here and yap  What we did was we had a couple have sex at a church, allegedly  And then we come strolling in and get all the credit  Right  Thanks  And then Howie follows us and everybody else  Yep  A lot of other people are going to be joining satellite radio in the very, very near future  It's going to be the only thing to do  Because with the crackdowns, you're not going to be able to do anything 
[01:54:00]  No, so  And then we got the MyFi promotion we're doing for the next few weeks  We have another MyFi to give away this week  And I think we're going to do it with Rich Voss tomorrow or Wednesday  If you want to do something crazy for MyFi, it's not too late  I guess you could just email Ben and Steve through the websites  OpianAnthony.com or FoundryMusic.com  That's what I should do for Christmas  That's what I should do  What's that answer?  Just get MyFis  For people  Because it's, you know, it kicks right in after Thanksgiving 
[01:54:30]  And then I sit there and go  Eh, you know, it's only November  You don't realize how quickly Thanksgiving to Christmas goes  And I'm the guy that ends up, you know, a week before Christmas  Just running around like a nut  We got like two and a half weeks left  I know  That's it  Oh, what do you got, Mr. Shopper guy?  I'm not, I don't know  I'm not really into the holidays this year  I would love to be able to say that  That's a great cop-out  I'm just not into the holidays  So you can all go screw yourself  There's no real reason to be into the holidays this year  Well, what do you  Oh, I understand 
[01:55:00]  But what are you going to do?  You got to  You're not exchanging any gifts?  Honestly, I've been thinking about  We got like a four-day weekend  I'm thinking of going skiing  You're going to leave?  Yeah, by myself  What a gimmick  I swear to God  I'm thinking, you know, just take that time  Go away  Do something I really want to do  Yeah  And screw everyone else  I would love to be able to do that  I, you know, I was there for everyone for many, many years  You know, I think I'm going to do something for myself this year  I have no responsibility or to worry about anybody 
[01:55:30]  And hoping they like my gifts or anything  So I might just take off  See, I got the whole family thing  Where we get together on Christmas Eve  And it's a big event at Grandma's house  And everyone exchanges  And I have not a clue  It's year after year after year  You got to get gifts for people  That you just don't know what to get them  Every year  I got an invite to my aunt's house  And I do have a really, really cool and great family  Extended family  And I was thinking about it 
[01:56:00]  Do I want to go to her house again  And see everybody there  Sitting in the exact same seats  Eating the exact same  I mean, it's the same  Same conversations  I see a movie every year  Yeah  Nothing changes  Yeah, but you can run off now  And not get them anything  Well, I'm going to run away  I'll throw a few gift certificates around  Gift certificates  And maybe I'll buy a couple gifts  I don't want to be, you know  Totally the party pooper here  But I think I'm going to go skiing  At least you'll be able to make eye contact 
[01:56:30]  With your family when you see them  Oh, Jimmy  You'll be able to make eye contact  Hi, I'm the guy that gets crapped on  Ho, ho, ho  You go skiing, you'll see your family  They love you  They're proud of you  And with his gifts  And then Jimmy  Yeah  I'm pretty inconsistent with my gifts, though  Like, I'm really bad  Like, one guy will get a sweater  And then someone else gets a big screen television  Like, I'm really awful  I have no  Is there any rhyme or reason to that, though?  There's no rhyme or reason 
[01:57:00]  It's not like you're trying to be  You just don't like that person  No  It's just like  Oh, I think he'll enjoy a sweater  Oh, I think she'll enjoy a large screen  I was walking around  I saw that and went  That'll cross something off my list  That's what I think  I'm not really thinking about  Oh, what would that person really like?  I'm years beyond that  Maybe years ago I thought about it  But after you finally decide what someone wants  And get it for them  How am I supposed to know  What an aunt of mine is going to want  Every year  Year after year after year  I don't know  So you get them something stupid  That they probably don't even open 
[01:57:30]  Or don't even use ever  And what am I supposed to do?  Like blow a bunch of cash  And get something real nice  That you probably won't use  I don't even know  The older you get  You just realize that Christmas is just a joke  It's for the kids  It's just a joke  No one really wants to be shopping  I'm telling you  There's a small percentage that enjoy it  And they're the ones that already have  All their shopping done  And their presents are wrapped  And they're hidden in their closet already  And they just can't wait to hand out those gifts  That's the minority  The majority are running around Christmas Eve 
[01:58:00]  You know, pretty much at a Kmart  Digging through the scraps  Or all of a sudden  They go to a 7-Eleven  Like we used to do with my grandma  And get her lottery tickets  Oh, the lottery ticket gift  You know, you just  Hey, this might be a gift  It might be garbage  Pretty much everyone else is  Last minute shopping  Hating it  Miserable  They can't stand Christmas  Yeah  Well, the gift part  Really makes Christmas a bitch  You don't want  Because I kind of like  The nostalgia of Christmas  It's that consistency 
[01:58:30]  That kind of thing  That was always nice  The lights  The tree  You know, getting together with the family  That part is really cool  I enjoy that  It's the goddamn shopping  The gift giving  That's the pain in the ass  It takes away from like  The good time you would have  It'd be nice to go into like  Your relative's house or something  And it's lit up  Stuff all over the place  Yeah, that's kind of cool  That's kind of cool  Sure  All the Christmas decorations  But then, you know  It's that stress  Of the couple of weeks beforehand 
[01:59:00]  What am I going to get this one?  Oh, I don't know  I haven't gotten anything for this one  It's a pain in the ass  You start panicking  You do  You panic  And then you overcompensate  You start buying more  I just hate it  I absolutely hate it  And I never get anything I really like  I don't even worry about that  I open stuff  I'm like  And then you got a fake  Like, oh yeah  I really need  Thank you  Years ago  I used to feel bad  I used to get like this guilt  That would come over me  And I would actually feel bad  Like I would picture somebody 
[01:59:30]  Buying me something  That I really didn't like  And picture them getting it for me  And feel really bad  That I don't like it  You're nailing it  That's exactly  Yeah  Because it's not about like  I'm hoping for some huge gift  I don't want anything  I don't really care  I'd rather have no gift  Right  Because I don't want the feeling  That you just described  There you go  Which made me just shiver inside  Because that's exactly how I feel  I hate that feeling  And it's like  Oh, they went out of their way  And maybe they didn't go out of their way  Maybe they're like me  And don't give a shit  And it's like  Am I reacting the right way?  Yeah  Oh, this is great  Oh, I'm going to be able to use this 
[02:00:00]  Thank you  Thank you so much  A St. Johnsbury sweater  That's nice  This is great  No, it'll keep me warm  I need  Yeah  Oh, yeah  No, no  I really  It's just overacting and stuff  This is perfect  If I'm a fat girl in 1988  This is the sweater I should wear  Where are my leg warmers  You idiot  So, I don't know why  We were talking about Christmas  But we're giving more of my fives away  That's  Now that's a good gift, right?  Anthony  I had a lot of fun  With the cherry darts thing  I haven't even  Like discussed this off air 
[02:00:30]  But I think we could probably  Develop it on air  I wanted to get  You know, listeners down here again  Because that was so much fun  And  I want a puking contest  We did this in Boston  For what?  Sox tickets?  Super Bowl  Super Bowl, wow  Yeah, Super Bowl tickets  We had good prizes  Yeah  What the hell did we pull that one off?  I don't know  And then we had guys eating clam chowder  That was hilarious  And whoever ate the most clam chowder  Thick, creamy New England clam chowder  With big chunks of clam in it 
[02:01:00]  In that creamy soup  All up to the tippy top of their bowls  Yeah  The ladle  The big ladle  Ladling out these  Huge ladle fulls  We underestimated that whole contest  Creamy clam chowder  Remember most people puked  Within the first ten minutes  And we had three hours of show to kill  Oh, I know  Like, uh  Now what do we do?  Well, now we'll have them  Eat the puke  For more Super Bowl tickets  We didn't know  We so underestimated  That whole mess  Someone did eat the puke, didn't they?  Yes  Oh, yeah  Yes, they did  It was one of the sickest 
[02:01:30]  But funniest shows  That's one show I search out  And listen to  When I see it online  That's one  If I'm like  Just kind of hanging out  Reading email  I'll throw that in the background  Because it's one of my favorites  Because it's so disgusting  And funny at the same time  Because then one guy's puking  And everyone else can't handle that  The same guy pukes  And then  Other guys are puking  Other guys start puking  The funniest thing is  One guy loses it  You just hear the liquid  Spill in the garbage pail  And then other guys  Kind of look over  And they're racing for a pail 
[02:02:00]  It's like a chain reaction  It's great  When are we going to have them puke though?  It's too small  That was the Boston studio  That was big  Oh, and it just  I don't know  We can figure  That whole area  We can rope off  It'll be easy  Right here?  Yeah, just move the  It's going to stink like vomit  Out there  Shut up  That's too close  We smell your rotting ass  Every freaking morning  I know  You're worried about guys  Puking in front of you  They're not bad  They're the worst  They are awful  When you let one loose  In the elevator  I'm hoping the cable breaks 
[02:02:30]  Just to end it  Ben got one in the elevator  He saw one of the apartments  I was shopping with  And I dropped a juicy one  Did ya?  Yeah  It was putrid  Speaking of Ben  How are you, man?  We haven't talked to you  In like five days  How is Big Duties Ben?  Big Duties Ben  Fine, thank you  So what happened to you?  I don't know  You don't know  I assume it's from the sushi I ate  Is what happened  What'd you have?  A tequila worm roll?  Yeah, right  I was sick, though  It was the first time  I've ever taken a day off  For being sick  What did you have for sushi? 
[02:03:00]  What kind of sushi?  All kinds of stuff  Spicy tuna  Tuna  Eel  Fish, though  Yeah, fish  Was it a reputable place?  No, it's a place  I'd actually never been  What?  What?  What happened?  I didn't say that  Somebody said something  Did you say something?  I said  Was it reputable?  No, it was a place  I'd never been to before  In Union Square  So I will not go to again  See?  It was bad  What happened?  You started to feel ill  Like when you were sleeping?  Yeah, no, no  Dude, it was bad  And then when you guys  Were calling me  Every five minutes  Trying to get me in the air  I was in so much pain 
[02:03:30]  I was like tearing  And I was just like  Danny was calling me  Every five seconds  And not answering the phone  Were you puking  And crapping at the same time?  I did that a couple times  What did you puking to?  Toilets  What did you crap into?  Dude, well  Well, not exactly at the same time  But it's like  Like a dog chasing his tail  In the bathroom  Just spinning around and around  There's nothing worse though  When you live by yourself  And you're sick  It is awful  Because you've got to get  You run out of toilet paper  You're running out of shit  I mean, luckily in New York  Luckily in New York  You've got delivery  So, you know  You've got places that deliver 
[02:04:00]  You had someone deliver you  Toilet paper?  Dude, yeah  How bad did you shit?  Alright  Dwayne  Dwayne Reed  Yeah, I need  Oh  Oh  I think you know what I need  Yeah  Just listen  You'll know what I need  Oh  I need industrial cleaning products  For my walls  For my food  Oh  Yeah, I need some Pepto-Bismol  I need a thermometer  Could you just send someone over here  To hold my head? 
[02:04:30]  Oh  I don't feel good  We had a good chuckle  At your expense that day  That's what I heard  Yeah  I didn't hear any of this  Hours of fun  Because of you  That's what I heard  Oh, we were hoping  You were listening  And they delivered your stuff?  Yeah, actually  There's a deli on my corner  I'll deliver you anything  For Jimmy  It cost him 500 bucks  Have a girl come over  And bring stuff  Treat him like a boyfriend  That's sick  I just want a little love  Nothing better than  Having a girlfriend  When you're sick  Alright, so  They get everything for you  Some soup  A little broth 
[02:05:00]  Heat up the soupy  Get your  Bring your thermometer  A little ginger ale, please  I could use  Yeah, I need  A little ginger ale  Oh, okay  Something  I'm feeling a little hungry  Maybe some beef bullion  Have some bullion  Baby, I can't find the remote  Could you  Sure  Yeah, it's under the  I don't know where it went  It's the best  Yeah  Anything goes  Yep  You go back to being  I don't know  Ten  Baby, I could use a BJ 
[02:05:30]  I'm so sick  I'm so sick  Could you take care of my fever junk  My fever junk  I got fever junk  My sack is like a fruit roll up  Laying on the bed  Could you  It's really warm  It feels like it's 120 degrees  I gotta get up and take a leak  Could you get a spatula  To get my sack off the bed, please  Just a spatula  And the sack is so big  It hangs  It actually hits into your awful dirty crack  Oh, it's awful  So the bottom of your sack is filthy  It's like if you chewed up 20 packs of Hubba Bubba 
[02:06:00]  And then just stretched it out and laid it on your bed  It's like the neck of an old person  Just hanging there  Gobbling  Just  That nastiness of skin  Yeah, fever junk  Baby, I got the fever junk  Could you get some ice on your hands  And just touch it  So everything contracts back up again  It's really annoying me  I rolled over on it before  And it hurt  Baby, I need a wet rag for my head  This one I have  It's getting warm  From my fever 
[02:06:30]  A whiny mess  Oh, sure  Thank you, sweetie  And as soon as I'm healthy  I just can't wait to start thinking about  How to attack them with a garret  Talking during the Yankee game  See, that's something, though  That you don't get from a candy the whore  What's that?  That kind of attention  When you're not feeling good  Oh, I don't get that from anyone  I don't expect it from a prostitute  But how about some lucky listener? 
[02:07:00]  Nope  Nothing  No, you know  You sleep with that candy girl all weekend  Like our intern Noah did  But then, you know  If Noah's laying there sick  What then?  Where is she?  Well, hopefully she's in Jersey  And she's on her way back  On your way back  Could you pick up  Altoids?  Definitely Altoids  And some  Summer's Eve  Yeah  Summer's Eve Altoids  Rubbing alcohol  And cough drops  I need cough drops  So getting back to the MiFi contest 
[02:07:30]  Oh, that's where we were  I love how we just go off, don't we?  And the puking contest  Yeah, Paulie's got a good idea  From Jersey  I emailed you guys last week  About a way to get the MiFi  You do the chowder contest  But replace it with  Eggnog  A little eggnog  I could see eggnog  Being a real puke catalyst, man  Cinnamon  Bad  All creamy  Heavy  Eggnog could work  Viscous  Of course, non-alcoholic eggnog  Oh, we don't want them getting ripped in here 
[02:08:00]  And we could make them drink eggnog  I don't know  Every five minutes  Whatever  A certain amount  Until they either puke  Or have to take a leak  Let's bring in the alcoholic stuff  Why not?  Some eighth graders  Sure  It's right up this show's alley  A bunch of irresponsible jack-offs  Get some kid in here  Give him some Jesus juice  Like old MJ  Hey, we could all get our mouths swabbed later  Probably the biggest star on the planet  Having his mouth swabbed 
[02:08:30]  You never, ever, ever want to have to have your mouth swabbed  Because it's never for something good  Never  Congratulations, you are the lottery winner  We found some DNA on the ticket  And it matches the swab  You'll never hear that  It always involves someone who's 12  Underwear of a minor  Yeah  And that's never the first bit of DNA that they're checking  Is the from the swab  It's always to match something  Yep  It's never  Yeah, we just want to keep it on record 
[02:09:00]  Just in case  No  No, they've already matched  They've already found something that they're trying to match  I'm sorry  Little distracted  Who is that?  That's our  Is that Lindsay Lohan?  Yeah, that's our girl  She's doing some whore act singing  Is it her?  Yeah, that's her  It is her  I wouldn't mind her if she didn't have an almost  Her hairline is atrocious  Is it?  Oh my god  Let me take a look  I wasn't even looking at her  I know, but look at the way she tries to cover that awful hairline 
[02:09:30]  There was a picture of her and her mom in the paper or something  Her mom's pretty hot too  She's going into a  She doesn't really  Yeah, she does have a five head  She doesn't really know how to move though  No  No, that's kind of cool though  She's all like stupid  It's all  It's a very herky-jerky  She's trying to be all rock-like  In front of  She gets in front of our guitarist  Grabs her crotch  And starts like rocking  I know  She wants to be a rock chick  But it's like a cartoon of a rock chick  She's really bad  She's a little chain hanging  It's on ABC if you want to play along at home 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, good morning  Good morning show  All right  An awful hairline  Got little chains  Knee-high boots on  So  Lead singer from Disturbed hairdo  Stupid bald bitch  So we got to  Let's get the details  Eggnog  Let's develop the eggnog contest  Why not?  We could do it in a week or two  Can they wear elf hats, Opie?  We'll do it like a week from Friday  Does that make sense?  That would be cute  Is that Christmas Eve?  When's Christmas Eve?  And we still have a couple weeks, right?  So  A week from Friday, yes?  I forgot  I have to plug something 
[02:10:30]  I haven't plugged  Oh!  If I may  Sure  The day before Christmas Eve  I will be performing  At the downtown in Long Island  I have to get the number tomorrow  But I will be performing  The day before Christmas Eve  You mean the 23rd?  23rd to goodnight  Yes, I will be at the downtown  In Long Island  Two shows  All right  Okay  I forgot  Anthony, we were going to talk about divorce  That lottery winner  I don't know where the story is  Oh, it just  This is amazing  Well, it figures  It figures  Yep  Oh, wait, wait  This guy won the Mega Millions 
[02:11:00]  Okay, I got it  Lottery  A couple of weeks back  Won just an F-load of cash  The guy was pretty much bankrupt  He was down to  He was down to what?  $20 in his bank account?  Yes, 76 cents  Oh, 76 cents  Wow, that's a big difference  He was $40,000 in debt on credit cards  Really in bad shape  And lo and behold  He wins the Mega Millions  He accepts  It was like $100  I'm not sure of the amount  $149 million  $149 million  He took the lump sum of $88 
[02:11:30]  Eight and a half million  And a half million dollars  That's what you get  After taxes  After everything  You get that cash  You now own $88 million  Actually, it's before taxes  Is it?  Not that it matters  Oh, sorry  No, it's after  Wait  It says  After  Rodriguez, 49  Opted to take his winnings  In a single lump sum payment  Of $88 and a half million  Before taxes  Before?  Why would you do  Instead of $150 million  How many million do you need? 
[02:12:00]  You don't want to pay it out over time  He still gets 40  Whatever  Why?  I think because it's non-transferable also  So if you die  That's it  They're off the hook  You can't leave it to your heirs or anything  It's one of those  How much does the government have to take?  Everything  Those leeches  Leeches  But how many million do you need?  The guy still will get what?  Between 44 and 50  Say 44, cut it in half  Yeah, 44 and 50 million dollars  Yeah, give half to those vultures  Yeah  Let's say he gets 50 mil  Here's the latest on Lottery Man 
[02:12:30]  Money not even $149 million  Can't buy a love  Juan Rodriguez  Who collected the huge windfall  In the Mega Millions lottery last month  Is now in the outs with his wife  Iris  By the way, the headline in the post  Was $149 million to Juan  Oh, really?  $149 million to Juan  Oh, J-U-A-N?  Right  Are you making that up?  No, he's right  That's the funny part about the  We can make up post headlines  And they're the same headlines  Yeah  Iris wants a divorce  From her husband of 17 years 
[02:13:00]  Right  And she filed the paperwork  Just 10 days after Juan  Bought the winning ticket  On November 19th  After he bought the winning ticket  Right  His ticket  Right  And now she wants  Half his winnings  Kicked him out  Of their house  Here he is  Won the lottery  Well, you know what?  She obviously wanted a divorce  From this guy a long time ago  They said they were on the outs  But he wasn't making  Any money whatsoever  So she still had  You know  A place to  You know what?  To sleep  He was making enough money  To keep a roof over her fat head 
[02:13:30]  And he was working two shifts  So he wins the lottery  And she sees her way out  Big time  Right  Now he wins the lottery  And she wants half  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Does she deserve half?  No  Nope  I say no  If she bought the ticket  I'd say she could walk away  With all the money too  That's it  That's how it should work  But how does it work?  It works that  Well now he's worth that money  And now that she's married him  That's how it works  Well get this  She boots him out of the house  So now he's staying at some hotel 
[02:14:00]  Which is you know  He could afford it  $347 a night hotel  Right  But  Because people are like  Banging on his door  And his hood  Yeah  Begging for money  Begging for money  I hear this happens all the time  With these lottery winners  Yep  But  He hasn't been able to pay for this yet  He's borrowing money  You might ask  Why  Why  Is he borrowing money  When he just won  This huge lottery  And has  $80 million  $45  $50 million  Whatever it is  Well  Her lawyer 
[02:14:30]  Put a freeze  On the prize  He can't  Even collect  Any money  From this lottery  That he won  Because his wife's lawyer  Put a freeze  On the money  Because they don't want him  God forbid  He spends any of it  That's her money  That's her money now  Too  So  This will go on  For years  The poor sap  Now  He wanted to handle this  Without any lawyers  Like out of court  Kind of settled it  I'm sure he probably  Even offered us something fair 
[02:15:00]  Probably a couple million  Minimum  Right  Now friends of his  Are saying  Now he's had to hire  A team of lawyers  Which you know  They're getting a lot of money  This poor son of a bitch  Is going to end up  Like so many of these  Other lottery guys  Broke  Just broke  But he'll have a good time  For the next few years  Maybe  If he can even get his hands  On any of this money  The guy's probably  Just sinking deeper in debt  He's probably borrowing  On the assumption  That he's going to be  Collecting this money  That's what some lottery people do 
[02:15:30]  But he will get the money  How do you know  After lawyers get a hold of it  After she gets a hold of it  This could be tied up  In court for so long  That a lot of this money  Gets burnt  Pig lawyers  They just really are  They pigs  They create nothing  They create nothing  They latch on  And they finagle behind the scenes  But they contribute  And create nothing  Yeah  You know I had to pay  For my wife's lawyer  Dominic Barbara  You know I had to pay that  Now where  Where does it make any sense 
[02:16:00]  That when two teams are battling  My team and her team  That I have to pay  For her team  For her team  And I have to pay her  Like what they call support  Why don't she pay for her own lawyer  Out of the money I gave  The money she took  From the bank account  Can't  She wiped out your entire savings  And you lost that money too right  Right  Right  But that's how it works  But I understand  That's how it works  And here's this guy now 
[02:16:30]  Lottery winner  And  She wants half  Greedy  It also says  Although the couple  Appeared together  At a news conference  After he won  His wife had previously  Given him the boot  Over his financial difficulties  And  She filed  He filed for bankruptcy  A month before his lottery went  And like you said  He's $44,000  In the hole  Before  He won the lottery  And he only had  78 cents  In his savings account  Yeah  There you go 
[02:17:00]  Got it  They just ruin everything  We have one more  One more good one  A Long Island woman  Whose physician  Ex-husband  Refused to pony up  Hundreds of thousands  Of dollars  In support payments  Has demanded the state  Suspend his medical license  Marjorie Horowitz  Of Syosset  Filed papers  That asked state officials  To force  Dr. Stuart Horowitz  And  He's a physician  In Massapequa 
[02:17:30]  To stop practicing medicine  Until he pays  $196,000  In back support  She's trying  Her and her lawyers  Are trying to get  His medical license  Suspended  Of course  What does that have to do  With anything  You could take him  To civil court  You could make him pay  You could have them  Garnish his paycheck  Or whatever the hell that is  But then to  And God bless this guy  Good  Good  He's holding on  To every penny  Really busting apart  That Jewish stereotype  But good for him 
[02:18:00]  He's not paying  Take it right to the brink  Make her spend a bunch  Of money on  On a lawyer  To try to get  This cash  That I'm sure  She's not entitled to  But then trying to  Suspend his medical license  So he can't practice medicine  What a vindictive bitch  That's probably the lawyer's suggestion  Of course it is  But she's the one going  Yeah  Do it  It's always the person  That has the final word  The lawyer comes up  With these great ideas  It's always the person  That has to say  Alright go ahead with that  Well this is Tommy in Brooklyn  Tommy go ahead 
[02:18:30]  Yeah I saw her  On television  After she won  And she was like  I don't care about nothing  Because now I'm rich  Don't rag on the lawyers  I'm not a lawyer  Don't rag on them  That's why  Oh stop it  She's evil bitches  Oh she is  That's what I'm saying  Check it out  She's a pig dude  But they are  They are blood suckers  I mean in marriages  Look things go wrong  A lot of times  The guy is not totally innocent  The woman has a point  A lot of times  The guy isn't  But these leeches  Just the way  Like they will stop  A friendly  Or amicable decision 
[02:19:00]  Even if the guy  Was going to give her  Say 30%  He might have said  Look here's 50 million  I'll take 30  You take 20  No I want half  Well the lawyer stepped in  You're entitled  You know you're entitled  To half of that  And my fee  Yeah  Please  Leeches  Tom in Indiana  What's going on  Hey what's going on  Hey  Hey listen  Same thing happened  Down in Crestview  Florida  Guy won 24 million  He's been married  Like 6 months  She turned around 
[02:19:30]  Divorced  You might have  For he won the money  Got half  See you later  Bye  Jesus  How the hell  Is that justified  So community property  Half your  Anyone that gets married  Is insane  You're a mad person  Alright  Well why don't we  Take a break  Our buddy Lazlo  From GTA  San Andreas  Yeah  When are we going to  Be allowed to talk  To this guy about GTA  They still have a blackout  You're kidding  The game's been out a month  I know  They still have a media blackout  Why  Lazlo did all the

No  Neither have I  But I said, let me go  Because Billy and I have the same manager  Was it a happy gay time down there on Broadway?  It was, yes  I bet it was  And I had my little camera  I'm like, I'm gonna go get some celebrity pictures  Even though with the invitations  There's a little note that came with every invitation 
[02:36:30]  That said, cameras are absolutely not permitted  If you bring a camera, be prepared to check it  No exceptions will be made  But I figured there's gonna be one exception made  And it's gonna be me  So I had my little camera on the side  And as my ex-girlfriend and I went  Because, you know, we're still friends  We hang out  We don't bang, of course  That's the weirdest thing ever  But  She's the only one I'm friends with  But I still like her as a person  And, you know, once you've fucked me  Why come back for seconds?  God forbid  You know, you should do that  Of course not  Just hang out for the jokes  You know  Oh 
[02:37:00]  Oh, God  Come for the jokes  Did you spit in the garbage can?  Pissed off  Out of respect  So we get there  And as we walk in  Rob Reiner's on the red carpet  I'm like, this is gonna be fantastic  I go downstairs  Waiting to use the bathroom  Right after I check my coat  And I hear a really familiar voice  I look up  Harvey Keitel is walking towards me  Oh  And I  This is star-studded  Dude, I love Harvey Keitel  Who doesn't?  So I clear my throat  And I kind of pump up my chest  And then I fucking stare at him  As he walks by  I say nothing to Harvey Keitel 
[02:37:30]  Oh, that must have looked odd  He must have been laughing in his head  Look at this  I wanted so bad to go  Can I get a picture?  We just got there  I didn't want to get thrown out of the theater  She was on the toilet  So I wound up not getting a picture  With Harvey Keitel  Some idiots in the bathroom  Staring at people  Just staring at everybody  And then he jerked off  On the side of my car  And told me  And then he spit my gum out  And then I was shot  And he took me to the hospital  All right  So while we watched  I'm not even going to give a review of the show  The show was excellent  The show was excellent  It was very funny 
[02:38:00]  It was moving  It was just great  During intermission  I'm down there  I'm waiting to use the bathroom  I see Chaz Palminteri  But there's too many people around  I can't get a picture with him  Because again  You don't want to get booted  I'm walking out of the bathroom  Robin Williams is online  For the bathroom  Robin Williams  Oh look  I can make something out of your camera  Look  It's a hat  Oh wow  That's funny Robin  Wow  That stream of consciousness  Just amazing  Well I like him  He was  Oh  Little fat man  Come up to Robin  Robin what do you want  He was the only celebrity 
[02:38:30]  That acknowledged me  Oh you know Robin  I know I'm casually  From the cellar  From the cellar  I just acknowledge you  Because you're a prop for me  Look  He's like my testicles  He puts out his hand  For me to shake  Big hairy mitt  Big Oscar winning mitt  And my hands were clammy  Because I had just washed them  But I didn't dry them properly  Oh good move  You're just a walking  Social faux pas  I shake his hand  With a wet hand  And I'm like  And I'm like  I'm like  It's only wet 
[02:39:00]  Because I washed it  He's like what  I'm like  I just washed my hand  That's why it's wet  And he kind of laughed  Oh you were explaining it  To  Explaining your damp paw  He laughed to be polite  And I think he was also grateful  That I wasn't getting urine  And semen all over his fingers  So he was just happy  To have to finally be rid of me  So we watched  I feel sweaty hand  Shut up  Say nothing funny  But he says it in a way  That everyone thinks  They gotta laugh  It was  I walk upstairs  It's mobbed  With celebrities 
[02:39:30]  After the thing  Tavern on the Green  Is where the big after party  Oh wow  Tavern on the Green  So I go there  And we're just kind of  Sitting there hanging out  Talking to people  Can I ask you  How you got invited to this  I have the same  Billy and I have the same manager  As Billy Crystal  Robin Williams  Oh  So of course  I got the invite  Great seats  In the mezzanine  You know  First row in the mezzanine  You can see the stage  The show is fantastic  We go to Tavern on the Green  Which I've never been to  And there's all these  Wealthy people  And power players  In the business  And I'm all fat  In my suit  My suit that I bought 
[02:40:00]  Last summer  Which fit great  I'm so depressed  Because I'm wearing  Like a silky shirt  Which just shows  My titty out  My ex looks phenomenal  And I'm just sitting there  I can't button my suit  If I button my suit  The bottom kind of  Flares out to the left and right  You know how you button  Something over your fat stomach  And the bottom  Flares out to the left and right  You know  It's like my suit  Flares out like  A little midget's hands  Well  I think it's time  For a new suit  No it's not  It's time for a sit up  Mom is right  Maybe you could tone up 
[02:40:30]  And not have to buy  New clothes every four weeks  You know  The gym right downstairs  You lazy bastard  Yeah you don't even have  To leave the building  Yeah hit the two  Before the L  You fat pig  And do a little  Stairmaster  Then go down  And get your car  And cruise prostitutes  And pretend you don't  Know they're trannies  So I'm at Tavern on the Green  And I see like a little  Hubbub in the middle  I walk  I walk into the middle  And I see there's  Billy Crystal  Having press photos taken  The press was allowed  To have cameras  And I don't want to 
[02:41:00]  Yank my camera out  Because I don't want to  You know  To get thrown out  But I yank my camera out  And I find Tanner  And I  I see Robert De Niro  Standing there  And I've never seen  Robert De Niro in person  And it floors me  Of course it does  It's De Niro  So I get Tanner  And Tanner works for Billy Crystal  She works for David  She's my manager's assistant  So she works for Billy too  And Billy's the one  Who didn't want the cameras there  Because they want everybody  To get bothered  Which is fine  De Niro could have trumped  My Clinton picture 
[02:41:30]  Dude De Niro  I know  And I'm like  De Niro  Remember we were thinking  About what trumps  My picture with  Ex-president Clinton  Opie  Could you just imagine  How nuts  Jimmy was going  Dude you don't  My heart  In his  It was De Niro  Going crazy  He's all about  Jimmy is all about  Pictures with celebrities  Right  Loves pictures with celebrities  He's so proud  Of every picture  Of a celebrity he has  He hangs them up  In his apartment  So people can gawk at him  And there is  The king  The greatest  That I would  De Niro 
[02:42:00]  One of the greatest  That would have been  On your top  Three  Three  Right  So I get Tanner  And she doesn't want  I'm like just come on  So I walk up behind him  Because he's going  Towards Billy Crystal  To do some press photos  I didn't even know  He was there  And I tap his arm  Oh no  I don't  You don't tap  De Niro  Ever  And I said  Bob  Bob  I called him  Bob  Hey Bob  You're not one of those  Guys on Leno  Where you can call  Robert De Niro  Bob  I can't even call  Bob Eatman Bob  I call him 
[02:42:30]  I call De Niro  Bob  Did he say  Hey Bobby  No we were hanging out  Me and Bobby  Me  Bobby De Niro  Chuck Heston  Yeah  Turns around  I put my hand out  And he shakes my hand  And I just  What I should have said  Was the hand dry  At this point  It was dry  Okay he dried it  On Robin Williams fur  That big foot  I was so speechless  That it was De Niro  And what I should have told him 
[02:43:00]  Was that I'm a comic  And I love king of comedy  I really do think  That's such a brilliant portrayal  Of comic psychosis  But of course I don't do that  Because I'm a nervous nothing  So I just go  I'm a big fan  Can I get a picture  And he said no  Oh no  It's the first  I'm amazed  The first  Celebrity  I'm amazed you're still alive  Turned down  I'm amazed you're still alive  Ever  I can't look at Jim now  I'm picturing the scene  And I can't look at him  Why didn't you kill yourself  This weekend  The only one that ever  Turned me down before  That was Frank Vincent  Who was the one that  Joe Pesci smashed his head 
[02:43:30]  In the car door  In the original  And they were the ones  That they stabbed  In Goodfellas  In the trunk  Right right  But that was going backstage  To see Kiss  And he had to be somewhere  So I really didn't count that  Because it was a mob scene  He was like oh  This was just a denial  Because you would be bothering him  No he was very nice about it  Of course he was nice about it  He said to me  He goes nah I'm just trying to see Billy  He's like and if I take one  Everybody's going to start asking me  And it's like I knew he was being truthful  He wasn't being a prick  He just didn't want  To have everybody take photos  Jimmy  Next time you're in a room  With Bobby De Niro 
[02:44:00]  You get a picture  Yeah  Next time  I got two handshakes  I believe I'm suicidal  But I did talk to my manager's son  Who said he was on the set  Of Analyze That  The last day of shooting  Bill Clinton showed up  And one of the people  Who had been working  With De Niro the whole time  Said about Clinton  She said this is the first time  That everybody in the room  Isn't staring at De Niro  So like everything he does  Everybody just looks at him  Because he's De Niro  I know  And I'm not saying that  He probably just doesn't want  To start a frenzy  Yeah  But he was nice about it  So I got Rob Reiner 
[02:44:30]  And I saw De Niro  And I saw De Niro talking  To this little man  And I'm like  Who was that little fella  He looks familiar  It was Yogi Berra  So I got Yogi Berra  Yeah Yogi Berra  That's just like getting De Niro  Meathead  Meathead is just as good  As De Niro  Sure it is  Dude  The only one that would have been  As good as De Niro  From all in the family  I already have Sherman Hemsley  Now I have Meathead  Would have been  Would have been  Carol O'Connor  That might have been  You are Rupert Pupkin  You are Rupert Pupkin  Exactly  I should have handed him  A Pride and Joy card  Maybe he would have  Taken a picture of me then  You know 
[02:45:00]  You should have  But I  It's not  It gets better  Or almost as good  Because I walk up to  I finally get near  Billy Crystal  Who I have one picture with  But it's really blurry  And I walk up  And I go  Billy  I go Billy  I'm a comic  And I just wanted to see  And we had the same  No I didn't mention that  I wanted to  But it would have been  Too groveling  Right  So I said I'm a comic  Same management  Different careers  Yeah markedly  I wanted to say  I said I'm a comic  I just wanted to tell you  I thought you were brilliant  Tonight  Because the show is great 
[02:45:30]  Yeah  And he gives me  A very cold  Thank you  And then he kind of  Walks away a little bit  What is that about  Don't know  I don't like that  Son of a bitch  By the way  My ex is there  With the camera  And I'm like  Just get it ready  So I kind of  Track him for a second  I'm like  You know  You think I can get a shot with  He goes  Nope no pictures  And he walks away from me  So that was how  The end of my night  Turned out  I'd never been turned down  By a celebrity  And you just got  Smashed in my face  I can't tell you  The depression I have  Yeah  That's Bobby De Niro 
[02:46:00]  I can see him  Walking away with his camera  With his head down  Just feeling  Nothing  Totally dejected  Mike Wallace was there  And I already have a shot  With him  So he walks by  And I smile at him  And he smiles back  So I'm like  Oh  Mike and I will chit chat  And I lean into his ear  And I kind of whisper  Like I'm a confidant  Yeah  I say  I'm really glad  They fired that awful man  Oh  I would have had  More credibility 
[02:46:30]  If I said  Are your stools  As inconsistent  As chicken broth lately  You 86 year old man  I'm glad they fired  That awful man  That awful man  And he just kept walking  He didn't slow down  It made me realize  Last night made me realize  Exactly  Maybe you thought  You meant Dan Rather  You know what  You're absolutely right  Good point  Oh my god  You're absolutely right  I didn't think of that  That's what I'll tell myself  Yeah  Miscommunication  Between myself  And the news legend  I just 
[02:47:00]  I don't fit in  In those places man  I really  You feel like an outcast  I know I'm an outcast  That's how I feel too  Whenever I go to those things  De Niro turn me down  Pixel Weasel from Georgia  On the instant feedback  One day we're going to go  To eatabullet.com  And all that's going to pop up is  I finally did  Across the screen  Dude  It's just  It reminded  Here's what bugged me  About yesterday  And I went through  My whole history  Of celebrity photos  Nobody I've ever asked  For a picture  Has recognized me  Now I know  I'm not super famous at all  But I just realized  I've contributed nothing 
[02:47:30]  After all the  Two years on TV  Not one person  Whether it's Ozzy  I'm going to kiss  Not one person  Went oh yeah  I enjoy your stuff too  But why do you care  So much about that  I don't know  Because he walked around back  All of his celebrity pictures  Were in a dumpster  Behind his house  It's about Schmidt  It's about Jimmy  I listened to that replay  Over the weekend  I laughed hard again  And I  You know  We're getting a lot of recognition  And we don't care  Like for some reason  You really care  About what  Just being recognized  By other celebrities  No no no 
[02:48:00]  I can't get the pictures  Like that though  I can't get the pictures  Not being recognized  It just hit me like  I don't believe  I don't walk around  But you wanted one of these celebrities  To go oh wow  Jim Norton from Tough Crowd  No I didn't even think of it  Until after the fact  I really didn't  I don't expect them to know  Who I am  It's not that you want it  But you know  You don't want it  But you want it  Available  You want to know  That they do know  Without them going  Hey Jimmy Norton  Or even  Only because it's easier  To get the pictures that way  But I didn't  I didn't think of it  Until afterwards  I just went over my history  I'm like Jesus Christ 
[02:48:30]  Not one person  That's ever entertained me  Have I entertained back  Oh boy  Maybe you have  And they just  Didn't recognize you  Now  How do you not recognize  This fat bird  Little baby bird face  Quickly blinking eye  Nervous picture  Picture  You're so close  To De Niro  De Niro  Dude  But he was nice  But he wasn't a dick  I couldn't get mad  It was just like  I know he probably  Gets bothered  If he takes one  500 people want him  We have some audio  Of last night  By the way  Yeah  God damn it 
[02:49:00]  And there's Jimmy  Walking away  Walking away with his camera  Oh he's coming  He's looking over his shoulder  With the camera  De Niro  No  No it's not gonna happen  No De Niro  Just  Billy Crystal maybe  He sees him  Billy  Billy  No  It's just not gonna happen  Today  He's not  He's just gonna walk away  De Niro  With his little camera  Oh  Oh  With plenty of shots left on it  Dude I cleared the camera  Before I left  I put everything 
[02:49:30]  Of course you did  And I cleared it  Oh and here's  Here's Jimmy  After the Billy Crystal  Let's know  And a man in my position  Can't afford to be made  To look ridiculous  Well that was  Jimmy Robinson Anthony  Ah yeah  He was a little braver  Than Jimmy Norton  Jimmy just  Walked away  Yeah this is  Didn't say anything  He didn't turn around  And say what  Jimmy  Jimmy Robinson would say  He just walked away  Oh this is audio  From De Niro  You are a disgusting 
[02:50:00]  Fat body  Project Kyle  Is that what you heard  As you were walking away  With your little camera  I couldn't tell  You were probably  Clutching the camera  With two hands  I just  I hit the button  And it went  And closed  Quietly  Yeah someone is saying  On the phones  If you are going to  Kill yourself  Could you at least  Do it live on the show  So we get the great  Exposure and ratings  No this isn't  Network  Or maybe jump out  The window  No  No please  This is not network  It's not going to happen  One for your pals 
[02:50:30]  Oh big dog  From Texas  Hey Jim  Did you see the  Intern's picture  With De Niro  Oh is that awful  Oh wow  Dude  I got two handshakes  So I did meet him  But  Yeah but there's  No record of it  There's no  I just  Booby man from Brooklyn  Wants to know  Hey Jim  To make matters worse  Did your ex go home  And get railed  By someone else  Oh I didn't care about that  I'm not trying to bang her  But I probably  She probably did  But I didn't  Try to sleep with her  Not that she would 
[02:51:00]  Alright well  And we know  Mormon Jordan from D.C.  It says  Jimmy you're a whore  You get a picture  With Rob Reiner  After you bashed him  As a liberal douche bag  Since you started with ONA  Yeah it's not about  Jimmy hates some of the people  He gets photographs with  What  It's just a collection  Of celebrity photos  And when I bash Rob Reiner  I'm bashing  As a political  Viewpoints and stuff like that  But as a  As a director of Spinal Tap  Dude he's a great director  Of course  He's an amazing guy  He was one of the greatest sitcoms  In history  He's an Emmy award winner  So no  He's a talented guy 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  Little tinkle drinker  From whackbag.com  Did little Jimmy  Slink away  And run right over  To Shelley Long's house  After the premiere  Last night  God De Niro  I'm not going to forget  That one for a long time  Just the feeling  Of his little arm  Bob  Bob  I called him Bob  Well this will help you  Larry from Jersey writes  How sad is this  Jimmy has said  Meeting De Niro  And being ignored  But yet I'm excited  About meeting Norton  How miserable is my life  See that should make you  Feel better  That's true  I'm an ass  And you're an ass squared 
[02:52:00]  No I did not get  Turned down De Niro  With a picture  I did not get turned down  No that did not happen  I was escorted out  I gave you my spot  Next to Billy Crystal  My spot  Alright well  Mr. De Niro  Mr. De Niro  What  Fat tits  What  Bobby I'm here  I got the briefcase  We can get started 
[02:52:30]  With the work  He opened his camera  He'd break everything up  Wow  Casey writes  Oh yeah  Well I got my picture  Taken with De Niro  At the Shark Tale  Premiere in Central Park  If it would make  Jimmy feel any better  I could photoshop  His face over mine  For him  There you go  I'm so annoyed  I'm sure there'll be  800 photoshopped  Pictures on the message board  Of Jimmy  And Bobby De Niro  Yeah go to  Bob  Go to whackbag.com 
[02:53:00]  Later today  You'll see all that goodness  I would have had  I would have had  More credibility  If I just would have  Done a bad  Pesci impression  And went  Hey stuttering prick  I just  Bob  How about a picture  You fucking  Why didn't I tell him  I'm a comedian  Why didn't I just  I can't  I can't  Talk to people like that  And he's a different level  Most people can't  Talk to him  He is a completely different level  Other actors can't talk to him  But I mean  I just  I'm a speechless idiot  Yeah 
[02:53:30]  James Lifter from the  Actor's studio was there  I wanted to ask him  But I tried to smile at him  And he just looked at me  Accurately  Like I was shit  And kept walking  That's why you don't  Go to those things  It's you know what it is  It's a little private club  That they all have  That you're just not part of  Occasionally  People like us  Are allowed in there  We're allowed in  The fishbowl  Not just looking in  But you're allowed in the fishbowl  And then you realize  You're just  You're just the goldfish 
[02:54:00]  In the piranha thing  You're just there  For them to rip apart  There's no being part of it  You could be right next to him  You could be touching his arm  And calling him Bob  And you're still  Just nobody  Why did you call him Bob?

He won the lottery, you know, and him and his old lady had been separated for six months.  And when they went to court, you know, the judge decided to give her a half of what the ticket cost. 
[03:01:00]  Ah, there you go.  That's all she got.  There you go.  Oh, wait, she only got 50 cents?  That's nice.  Yep, that was it.  And the guy won the lottery?  Yeah.  Six months after they'd been separated, but, you know, she got half of what the ticket cost.  That's all she got.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yes.  Cool.  Thank you.  And I just remembered that when y'all was talking about the lottery.  Cool.  Thanks, Joe.  You enjoying the program today?  I love it, man. 
[03:01:30]  I used to listen to y'all when y'all was up in Jersey.  Okay, cool.  And I was so glad when y'all got syndicated to Ohio so I didn't have to go as far.  I'm a truck driver, you know?  Of course you are, Opie.  Why are you asking me more questions?  I'm a truck driver.  You know, we got an hour to go.  I figured this would kill 30 seconds.  You never know.  30 seconds.  It's a truck driver.  I think he was ready to hang up and you asked him another question.  It's a truck driver.  Yeah, I'll be doing that.  And now you're bitching about it and that just wastes another 20 seconds.  See, I'm a genius when it comes to this radio thing.  Trust me on that.  Hey, Joe.  Bye. 
[03:02:00]  Just spread the virus for us.  That's all I was going to say.  If you're enjoying what you're hearing, we could use the help as far as marketing of the show.  You tell your friends and maybe they'll subscribe as well.  Okay?  I do, man.  All the time.  And where are you driving to, Joe?  I'm in South Dakota right now.  South Dakota?  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  See you, Jimmy.  Hi, Joe.  Joe, one more thing.  Bye.  Ah, wow.  Damn it.  Brian from Texas, go ahead.  Yeah, I want to say that the first time I heard about you guys was on the meet and greet 
[03:02:30]  on XM Comedy and I've been hooked ever since.  Oh, thanks.  And then about the doctor whose wife's trying to get his medical license suspended, how the  fuck is he supposed to pay her if he can't work?  We didn't state the obvious, of course.  Like, she wants $196,000 from her doctor husband and she wants his license to go away for a while.  How's he supposed to make his money?  I'm sure she...  That's pretty good chunk of change.  I'm sure they assume that he has more than that in his bank account. 
[03:03:00]  Gotcha.  So if you take away his license, he can't practice medicine, he can't have any more money coming  in for him until he pays her.  It doesn't work that way.  Okay.  Lady Di's on the line.  Lady Di.  Hey, how's it going?  It says you just want to say hi, right?  Yeah.  Say hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  All right.  Anthony, so...  It says she just wants to say hi.  And she did.  And she did.  Now we're going to have to, like, fill that five minutes we would have done with her with 
[03:03:30]  better comedy.  The paper today, Anthony, Daily News, top ten corniest lines, but they say the top ten pop  corniest lines.  That one doesn't even make sense on any level.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah!  Bob.  Hello, Bob. 
[03:04:00]  Bob.  Yes, Opie?  Hold on.  I got a cue on my thing here.  I see you're cueing something up.  All right, good.  Top ten corniest, pop corniest lines in movie history, Anthony.  Pop corniest.  I smell popcorn, huh?  Yeah, what are they burning today?  What the hell is that?  Every morning we burn something around here.  That was weird.  I'd like some popcorn, guys.  Who's making popcorn?  What the hell is this place?  Is that popcorn?  Who is it? 
[03:04:30]  I smell hot buttered popcorn.  I'd like some, Ant.  I don't know about you, but it smells delicious.  I thought they were popping some popcorn so we could get into the mood of the top ten popcorn  in his life.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, read the list, have a little popcorn.  Maybe we could pour it in Noah's ass and have a few strippers lick it out happily.  For free.  Of course, no charge at all.  No charge for you.  You'll get him back, you know, when he has to get your coffee.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that really strains him out. 
[03:05:00]  He'll probably squeeze clear stuff into it.  Do we want to hear the top ten?  I'd love to.  The top corniest lines of all time.  Now, how did they come to these?  Well, of course.  They're the corniest lines.  I guess they polled some moviegoers.  Sure.  That's what they did.  Polled moviegoers.  Now, corniest would be where you kind of go, ugh, when they say it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And most people don't remember movie lines, so I don't know how they came up with this 
[03:05:30]  list.  It doesn't really.  Oh, it does say a survey of 2,000 moviegoers.  Could you tell us the movie, and maybe we'll see if we can get the quote?  Oh, it's a fun game.  You can play at home.  I like that.  Oh.  Listeners like when they're involved, where they can kind of feel smart about themselves.  Yeah, but don't give the quote away, because that might be too obvious.  I won't.  All right.  In 10th place, everybody.  Mm-hmm.  Can I tell you the actor that did it, too?  Will that help you, or just the movie?  I say just the movie.  Just the movie.  One hint at a time, right, Ant?  All right.  Yeah.  Maybe then we've got to ask for another hint.  Well, no one's going to get this one, because it's a movie I don't think anyone saw.  Well, we'll be the judge of that. 
[03:06:00]  In 10th place, it's a lot.  We have popcorn.  I know.  I smell.  I got a great sense of smell.  Hot, buttered popcorn.  Who's got that from a movie?  Jimmy's filling his fat face again.  More carbohydrates, fat kid.  Hey, you got any ice cream you can just smear all over my fat body?  Maybe a little cheesecake on the underswell of my bosoms?  All right.  So, in 10th place, Anthony, it's from the movie The Postman.  The Postman. 
[03:06:30]  I saw that one.  You did see The Postman.  With, what's his name?  Kevin Costner.  Kevin Costner.  Oh, very good at that.  I did see it.  Okay.  That was a good one.  It was like Waterworld on ground.  It was.  It was Waterworld on the ground.  Well, do you know the line?  From The Postman.  Everyone is bringing in carbohydrates for Jimmy.  Was it something like, you know, he can't help himself.  Don't do that to him.  He's not going to start eating the party mix, is he? 
[03:07:00]  Big party mix.  Yeah.  Was it something like Ride, Postman, Ride, or something to that effect?  You a handsome man, Mr. Garrison?  Here's the line.  Get ready to puke.  Because no one's going to get this one.  You're a godsend, a savior, a blind woman tells him.  No, he replies.  I'm just the postman.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Costner should have said, no, I'm a bore.  I love that movie. 
[03:07:30]  It was done in real time.  All right.  The next one everyone should get, Jerry Maguire.  Show me the money.  Is that corny?  No, that's not corny.  It's corny beyond comprehension.  It is corny.  There was one that was so much worse than that in the movie.  Yeah, I know the one.  I know the one.  What?  I think I do.  Can Mr. De Niro show me the picture?  No, I think they're looking for the lovey-dovey story in that.  Yeah.  What was the line?  I had you, you had me at hello thing. 
[03:08:00]  Hey, can I have your bell today?  I'm going, Ant.  This isn't the inappropriate bell.  This is the you got a right bell today.  All right.  Yeah.  Yes.  Renee Zellweger.  Zellweger.  And Jerry Maguire, when she says to Tom Cruise, you had me at hello.  You had me at hello.  That's Bob Kelly weeps.  All right.  Top 10.  You got a blubbering ass he is.  You ninny.  Act like a man.  Your body like a Turk.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you? 
[03:08:30]  This guy has little fat hands.  The only reason I was crying is because both her arms weren't broken.  That's why you got to listen to the whole program, folks.  Find out what Jimmy's talking about when we replay the show starting at 10 o'clock this  morning on the East Coast.  Yes, sirree, Bob.  Bruce from Philly.  What's up?  De Niro.  Yo, the 11th top corneous line would be Jim Norton from Spider-Man.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Sure, that happens to be a cult classic.  That is.  Yeah, that's not... 
[03:09:00]  All right.  That was a fine line.  Lady Di's back.  Lady Di, what's up?  How's everything going?  I don't have satellite radio, so I don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:09:30]  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  We're getting retarded.  Da!  Da!  Come on, Anthony.  Didn't you call just to say hi?  I called to...  I don't have XM satellites, so how would I know what you're talking about?  Did you call just to say hi?  No.  Well, yes.  Yes and no.  All right.  Say hi.  At least say hi.  Okay.  I'm saying hi.  Anthony, so...  The top ten popcorniest lines in movie history. 
[03:10:00]  Popcorniest.  It's all movies within the last ten years.  These aren't fattening, are they?  Doritos?  Oh.  Dude, stop.  Just stop.  We have a couple more, Ben.  Oh.  Get your shit fingers off there.  You're going to wonder.  Yeah, just think of where those fingers were.  I know.  In the back of his throat and his pants.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Maybe you could take a dump on the floor and we could pull a Jeep in and go four by four. 
[03:10:30]  Jesus.  You're rotten volcanic colon.  Beat it.  Mount St. Helens colon.  I feel bad for all the people that are just tuning into the show for the first time today.  They're missing so many of the inside gags.  This show is filled with a lot of inside gags.  That's why you've got to listen a long time.  Okay, Anthony.  Oh, good.  Eight.  Did you have...  No, no, no.  I just wanted to know that really the inside gag with Ben is that our producer shits like  a goose with colon cancer.  That's our producer.  There you go. 
[03:11:00]  All caught up.  And restaurants collect it and serve it at very high prices.  Anything?  The goose liver...  You were going with a pate joke there?  Wow.  I knew halfway through.  Yeah, there was no confidence there.  No, it wasn't.  There was nothing.  I've heard rape testimony delivered with more confidence.  I knew I shouldn't have went out.  I was drinking.  It was...  It was...  I realized as soon as I started that it's goose liver and we were talking about goose 
[03:11:30]  poop and I was praying that I still could pull it out.  Yeah, no.  Oh, man.  I'd start sweating inside.  That was awful.  I got all tingly inside like, oh, my God.  Oh, no.  I'm doing it.  This has nothing to do with the other...  Giambi made a steroid admission with more dignity.  All right.  Well, eighth place in the top ten popcorniest lines of all time.  All right.  It's from Braveheart.  Braveheart.  Jimmy, you want to stab at this one?  I don't know the whole line.  Is it the one that ends with a freedom? 
[03:12:00]  You can't take my freedom?  They may take our lies, but they will never take our freedom!  Yes.  We got that.  All right.  Make a mess of his guts.  The seventh corniest line is from Independence Day.  Oh.  Was it the opening credits?  That movie was chock full of corny bullshit.  Really corny stuff.  I don't know.  It's Bill Pullman. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, right.  As the U.S. president vowing to fight off alien invasion by saying,  Today we celebrate our Independence Day.  That was really a douche-chilling moment.  And that could have been a great movie, too.  Yeah.  The effects were cool, but he had to be a black, funny guy beating the alien.  I'm tired of what we stopped with the shuck and jive and letting Will Smith just do what he does.  Always the shuck and jive with those guys.  They always got to be all ghetto.  And in Men in Black, you go, oh, it's like Reign in Black, folks.  Why?  You're a good actor. 
[03:13:00]  He's got to be the step and fetch it.  That's not his fault.  Tap dancing for the man.  That's how white people write for black people.  No one of black people hate us.  All right.  In sixth place, top ten, Popcornious Lines.  It's from Notting Hill.  What?  From Notting Hill.  Oh, is that a goddamn...  All right.  Get Steve in here.  Yeah.  Steve would know.  Yeah.  It is a chick flick, after all.  Thank God I didn't lose that competition.  No one will remember that I came in second place.  Yes, I know. 
[03:13:30]  Thank God you came in second and not first.  Steve, do you know any lines from Notting Hill?  Notting Hill.  The fine Julia Roberts chick flick.  That's with...  What's his name?  No.  I've seen it.  I'm trying to think of any specific lines.  Said by who?  Said by...  I knew I'd screw up.  I knew I'd screw up.  I'm like, is it six or ten?  That song is stuck in a lot of people's heads, by the way. 
[03:14:00]  It was good you played it there.  And it was six.  Is the internet for Martini's, too?  Sorry, Steve.  Yeah.  The internet is for porn.  What a dick.  Maybe the internet is for pate.  All right.  All right.  God, I started feeling uncomfortable right off the bat.  Maybe Stalker Pate will call it.  You could goose her.  Pate cakes.  No, Steve? 
[03:14:30]  Like Hugh Grant lines or Julia Roberts lines?  How many times have you seen this flick?  Several, actually.  What's the corny line from it?  Popcorny.  Anything?  No, I can't.  Another fine appearance by Steve.  Yeah, no, sorry.  Thank you.  Go back to doing nothing or whatever.  Where are you going in the other room?  Yeah, thank you, Steve.  Take care.  There he goes, Martini Steve.  I don't know why.  I love when they hit him on the FU line.  It's just so funny to hear them going, 
[03:15:00]  And fuck you, Martini Steve!  Oh, yeah, they hate him.  He does nothing to bring out such hatred.  No.  Well, Eric says through my headphones that he has Notting Hill drops.  Let's hear what you got.  I'm really sorry about last time.  Oh.  He just flew in.  I had no idea.  Fine.  In fact, I had no idea if he was ever going to fly in again.  How many of these do you have?  What?  Holy shit.  What?  Oh, don't wake me up like that, Opie. 
[03:15:30]  There's a lot of them.  I was really like...  We don't need to hear a lot of those.  Notting Hill off, they should call it.  That's what I was doing.  He has 35 drops from the movie.  I would have been Notting Off Hill.  Well...  Would that have been funnier?  Eric, how about this?  How about Goose Crap Hill?  Oh, it's Pate Hill.  Here's the line.  Yes?  In seventh place...  Or sixth place, we're up to, right?  It's Julia Roberts in Notting Hill.  I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her. 
[03:16:00]  Do you have that one?  I knew that one, too.  You did.  Of course you did.  Why did you know that one, Martini Steve?  It was on the tip of my tongue, and I was trying to figure out the correct...  Sorry.  It bugs me that that's the only line I could remember.  I just couldn't get it out right.  Will you do us a favor?  The next time that your wife wants you to go to a chick flick, could you please say no?  Yeah.  You're embarrassing all of us.  And could you stop rolling your sleeves in tightly?  It's really uncomfortable. 
[03:16:30]  That's not rolled up.  They're just not there.  All right.  No, that wasn't what she asked me, though.  That wasn't...  That's what that is more porn.  Thank you.  I'm just interrupting you, okay?  You're not poking me.  Porn to porn.  Porn, porn, porn.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Two brilliant appearances by Martini Steve today.  All right.  I love how he does that.  Steve.  Steve.  All right.  If you have these, just whisper in my ear, okay? 
[03:17:00]  Whisper.  Whisper.  In fifth place, Anthony?  Just a guy in an engineer room talking to a shock jock.  Saying, I love you.  Hoping he'll acknowledge me and stop yelling at me.  It's from Top Gun.  Top Gun?  Yeah.  That would be...  Let me think.  I know Top Gun.  Top 10, pop corniest lines.  Corny.  Is it the one with the chick?  In movie history.  I know what it is.  Is his name Kelly McGillis? 
[03:17:30]  No.  Nope.  Or is it...  No, it's that, uh...  What?  Macho, uh...  It's when Tom Cruise goes,  Hey, Goose.  Duck, faggot.  No?  No.  Tuck and roll, Goose.  No?  You don't have it yet?  I thought you didn't have it.  I think it's, uh...  Let me think.  Is it the locker room?  Locker room scene?  You could be my...  Oh, no.  It's on the deck of the ship was that one.  You could be my wingman anytime. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yes.  Do we have that one?  That one was awful.  Looking?  All right.  Don't worry about it.  It's not that important.  Everyone has heard it a million times.  I already know the top one corniest line.  It's when Bob Kelly cried.  Watching those little fat arms shake back and forth.  That was a movie.  That was a documentary.  It is a movie.  It's called The Life of a Turk.  Starring Bob Kelly.  Wait, what do you got?  Eric's got some.  I don't know.  Just play it.  We'll see if that's it. 
[03:18:30]  Hollywood, we're losing Pfeiffer.  Let's just stay on Jester.  Oh, no.  No.  Stay on Jester.  Find Pfeiffer.  He's out there somewhere.  Stay with Hollywood, man.  We're covering his wing.  What an awful, awful movie.  Don't get me wrong.  It ruled when it came out.  What was the big song?  You never close your eyes.  No.  There's the other one.  Who was it?  Berlin?  Oh, I like Take My Breath Away. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, no.  This is big.  Yeah.  Take My Breath Away?  Berlin?  I did a TV show with her.  She was very nice.  Me and her.  Coolio.  It was a Marc Maron show.  She was on that stupid VH1 non-award show.  Dude, you never closed my eyes was in that movie, too.  What?  You never closed my eyes.  No, that was them kind of singing to the jukebox.  Yeah, but that was in there, too.  Yeah, it was in there.  Yeah.  It'd be part of the soundtrack.  Oh, okay.  But no, it was Berlin.  There it is.  What a great song.  The love song.  She still looks pretty good.  I saw it last night on a VH1 thing.  She looked really good back then, and she still looks pretty good. 
[03:19:30]  With her half-blonde, half-black hair thing.  Good song, though, right?  No, this stinks.  You don't like this?  No.  Dude, I spent like...  It's a great song to play while you're calling up hookers.  I'm not saying I'm not...  That bang in time is afraid.  How much?  Too much?  200.  Come over.  Suck my...  We're going to dance to Berlin.  Take my cash away.  Take my cash away.  Very funny. 
[03:20:00]  Sure.  Top ten pop corniest lines of all time.  And...  Slow fade.  Where are we up to?  Fourth place.  Okay.  Work well.  Job well done.  The movie is Ghost, everybody.  Ghost.  Mm-hmm.  The single tear rolling down her face like Bob Kelly.  I know the corniest line was, I'm so scared of spooks.  No offense, Whoopi.  Now turn it into an inappropriate bell and hit it.  Oh, okay.  Why?  It was in Ghost. 
[03:20:30]  Ah.  Another good tune.  I think I hit the inappropriate bell better than you.  I don't know what the corny line from this would be.  Well, it's Swayze in Ghost.  He says, I love you.  And co-star Demi Moore says...  Oh, no.  I messed it up.  Demi Moore says, I love you.  Like it matters.  I know.  And Swayze replies, ditto, yes.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Okay.  In third place...  I got it.  How come you didn't clink the old bell for Jimmy Norton?  Atta boy. 
[03:21:00]  Remember when they were working the pottery wheel and their hands looked like Ben after  the weekend?  That's funny.  Lady Di's back.  Lady Di.  Oh.  Hey, how's everything?  Good.  What's going on?  How are you?  How are you?  What's going on?  Oh, nothing much.  As of tomorrow, my phone's getting shut off.  Why?  It gets better and better with her, doesn't it?  Because I can't pay the phone bill. 
[03:21:30]  I love this song.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded.  What did you cut that out?  Don't pay your phone bill.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Oh, my God.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded. 
[03:22:00]  Turn my phone off.  Wow, that's off the hook, yo.  How much money?  That's your phone.  I'm sorry.  How much money do you need for your phone bill, Di?  Almost $400.  Who are you calling, or how long has that been?  I've let the phone bill go for a few months.  That's what happened.  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, listen to me.  I'm really going to give you advice now, okay?  Are you listening?  Yeah, but you're fading away.  No, no.  I'm giving you advice.  Listen to me. 
[03:22:30]  You're fading away.  Are you there?  Yes.  You're fading away.  No, that's your life.  Your life's fading away.  Listen to me, Lady Di.  This will sum it up.  What?  Marion.  Yeah, I am.  The other half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, where did you come from?  Where did you call him from?  Her phone that she pays the bill for, idiot.  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Thank you, Marion. 
[03:23:00]  She's fading away.  What's going on, guys?  Something she can never say about that body of hers.  Hey, Marion, how is your cow's tongue in little chick mouth?  How is what?  That's the problem, Marion.  What's the problem?  You have the tongue of a cow in the mouth of a little baby chick.  Yeah, your mouth, that's why you're always tripping over it.  Yeah, your tongue is a little too big for your mouth.  I did notice that a long time ago.  Hey.  Yeah.  You know, I'll stick it, guys.  All the matter for life.  Your tongue would be perfect if a plane skidded off the runway. 
[03:23:30]  It could loll it out and it could slide to safety.  What's going on?  Hey, shut up, Jimmy.  The tongue definitely gets in the way of some of your words.  Yeah, well, something gets in the way with you guys.  It's your mouth.  Hey.  Marion Comeback.  I love them.  Another brilliant Marion Comeback.  Wow.  We love the Marion Comebacks.  Hey, Anthony Opie, what's going on?  What's going on with Diane?  What's she calling you for now?  She's calling because her phone is being shut off.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Not tomorrow.  Thank God. 
[03:24:00]  That means she will not be calling the show anymore.  Well, she's not going to be calling the show anymore.  Hey, Di, are you still whoring around, having people stay there who belt you?  No.  Who hits you in the jaw?  Why did he hit you?  Yeah.  What guy?  Everyone told us that he hit you, so what was the story?  Diane, I'll hit you.  Hello?  Why does she keep hanging up?  She hung up.  Maybe her phone got shut off right then and there.  All right.  Who hit her?  What?  Who hit her?  That guy that was living in her house.  She didn't tell me this guy hit her.  You know something?  Let me tell you something, Marion. 
[03:24:30]  Some guy is living over her house.  I know that.  And then, well, no, shut up.  Some guy was living over her house.  Yes, I know that.  I know Howie.  And she said, oh, my God, shut up.  Let me talk.  Shut up.  All right, God.  The guy was living over her house.  I talked to him.  Son of a bitch.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  She can't.  Holy retarded.  I love you guys.  Well, she knows the guy.  Marion.  Yes.  Quiet. 
[03:25:00]  Let me talk.  And then.  Go ahead.  God, I want to kill her.  And I'm with Marion.  Go ahead.  You're good.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  There was a guy that was living over her house.  He's still there.  She is.  I swear to God.  Go ahead.  I would.  Hello.  Yes.  Shut up.  Okay, go ahead.  I'm finished.  Yeah, I don't know what the problem is, Ann.  She's letting you finish your story.  Yeah, she's just chiming in.  There was a guy.  His name was Jim.  And he lived with Lady Dot. 
[03:25:30]  And for some reason,  all of a sudden,  Lady Di said he wasn't living there anymore.  That she had kicked him out.  She said it was because he had called her something.  What?  That day.  What?  Jesus Christ.  What was it, Jim?  Do you remember what the guy had called Lady Di?  Something like Fatso or?  Yeah.  Hey, get a load of Fatso over there.  It was something accurate, I'm sure.  Yeah, it was something accurate.  I didn't know that this guy hit her. 
[03:26:00]  Shut up!  Nobody hit me.  Diane, you didn't tell me this guy hit you.  Why didn't you tell her?  Yeah, why didn't you tell her?  She's your best friend.  Because you know that I would kick the guy's ass.  That's why.  No, you wouldn't.  You're not kicking anyone's ass.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Hit him with your long midget arms?  I know you're a tough broad.  Believe me.  I know you're a tough broad from Queens,  but you're not hitting anybody  and you're not kicking anyone's ass.  No, if this guy hit her, that ain't right.  I'd give him a good tongue lashing.  Diane, why are you telling people 
[03:26:30]  this guy hit you  when you didn't tell me  that this guy hit you?  What the hell is going on over at Westfield?  Nothing is going on over here.  Why are you telling people  that this guy hit you  if he really didn't hit you?  Why do you say these things?  First of all, nobody hit me.  The guy punched you in the jaw  and that's why it was bruised.  No, no, no.  Anthony, no.  Yes, yes.  Diane, I hope he didn't ask you.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Hello?  Her phone keeps crapping out, Marion.  It's probably a cordless  and she's wandering around. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, she's drinking.  That's why.  Oh, that's always good.  Well, you know something?  At her point, I recommend drinking  because she's on that slope,  that long, slippery slope.  You might as well just be tanked.  Guys, she's getting a lot of utilities shut off.  Yeah, she'll lose one little piece of her life  at a time.  You know, the phone will go.  Then the electricity.  And then the place she lives.  And she will be, she will end up homeless.  The hair is already going.  She's going to end up in a shelter, 
[03:27:30]  in a woman's shelter somewhere,  getting beaten because she's stupid.  Because she doesn't want to get help.  Well, she already has hair like Ben Franklin.  Can she do something to thicken that a little bit?  Come on.  She doesn't want to get help.  There's nothing anybody could do for her.  Your friend Jim had talked to her.  And what can, you know.  Yeah, but.  He's cool.  No, but he.  No, but he.  Yeah, let me say, but.  What?  Go ahead.  No, he's having too good a time drinking. 
[03:28:00]  See, it's not outweighing the bad yet.  It's still such a party.  It must just be so much fun over there in her house.  I'm trying to get her help, but she doesn't want it.  With the candles because the electricity is off.  No phone.  Well, once you.  But as long as you got to cool it with some ice in it  to keep the beers cold.  She doesn't have a vehicle.  I told her to get rid of her vehicle.  She is a vehicle.  Why don't you invite her to live with you?  I can't.  You guys have been good friends for a long time.  No, she can't.  You're like the odd couple, aren't you?  You have no room in the house?  Nope. 
[03:28:30]  Why not?  Odd in other ways.  I don't have that big of a house, okay?  Don't you have two houses?  No, I don't.  Don't you have one on the Jersey Shore?  Yes, but that's just to go down once in a while.  Have to live down there.  Huh?  She could live down there.  You're like a beach bum.  She could wear one of those white floppy hats  to keep the sun out of her eyes.  No, come on, guys.  She really needs help.  She doesn't want it.  Well, then, you know what?  Tough shit.  I'm realizing, you know.  I'm so sick of.  I've been trying to help her.  I'm so sick of people like Lady Di.  We did our best.  We pointed her in the right direction. 
[03:29:00]  I'm not going to spend my time trying to help someone  that doesn't want to be helped.  Time for the analogy, Hope.  My brain now is trying to figure out what I could do for her.  I send her out job.  I'm like, cool.  The rep told her to go here, go there, go here, go there.  She refuses.  Yeah, you're right.  Time for the analogy.  I mean, I don't know what else I could do.  Look, yeah.  It reminded me of something.  It is the baby turtle thing all over again.  You know, nature has proven that not all the baby turtles  will make it to the ocean. 
[03:29:30]  And if they do make it to the ocean,  they're not going to see adulthood.  They all don't live.  All the ones that hatch there on the beach.  Lady Di is going to be the baby turtle that ends up on its back.  On its back right before the surf.  To no one to flip it up right.  Maybe Lady Di will be the one where the seagull comes down  and grabs it by its little leg and carries it off.  That's right.  You know, I mean, I appreciate that you guys are trying that.  No, we're not trying anymore.  We tried for about five minutes.  She got our attention for five minutes.  That's it. 
[03:30:00]  Well, I hope to see you guys before Christmas.  Shut up.  I don't know if I'll be up on myself.  All right.  It just goes on and on and on.  You know, we could start auditioning new partners for you.  Hey, how's that?  Well, that's good.  Yeah, because you're not that good by yourself.  So, you know, Lady Di is going to be dead soon,  and we'll get a new Lady Di for you.  Don't say dead.  Well, maybe we'll get a supermodel to play the new Lady Di.  Don't say dead.  Come on.  Compared to the old one, anybody you get would fit that bill.  You know who we could get?  Come on.  Who is the fat chick from Facts of Life? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, Mindy Cohen.  Mindy Cohen.  Let's get her.  She's an actress.  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  Oh, come on.  So she could come in and do that, perhaps?  Well, how about Wendy Jo Sperber?  Wendy Jo Sperber?  I haven't seen her in anything.  Maybe the Snapple Lady?  She's dieting.  Wendy?  Maybe we could get her.  Who's dieting?  Dieting.  Who's dieting?  Wendy Jo Sperber and the Snapple Lady.  Oh, shut up.  They're both dieting?  Yep.  Aren't they the same person?  No.  They do look alike.  I'm just kidding.  Wendy Jo Sperber was in Bosom Buddies with Tom Hanks and the guy who went nowhere. 
[03:31:00]  And the other guy.  All right, Marion.  Next to greatness.  Marion, Merry Christmas, because we're not going to see you or talk to you before Christmas.  If you're mine, I might call you up one day next week, but I'm off to hear them.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you, Marion.  Guys, guys, thanks for having me.  And there she goes.  The other half of the retarded.  Laverne and Shirley.  What a complete mess these two are.  At least Marion kind of has things together. 
[03:31:30]  Married.  Yeah.  At the house.  The bills are being paid.  Her husband, Joe.  Her husband.  But the lady died.  She is truly a mess.  Retarded.  Truly a mess.  Hey, you know what?  This is going to end our night.  Yeah, this is perfect.  Wait a minute.  What about the quotes, Opie?  Trust me.  I got it under control.  All right.  Where are we?  We're up to the third popcorniest line in movie history.  I love how we do these countdown things, and it takes us forever because we never stick to the subject. 
[03:32:00]  We just don't care.  We have ADD.  We just have ADD.  We go off on tangents.  We're like little kids on sugar rushes running around the room.  Some idiot started a discussion.  They thought this show was scripted.  How could this program possibly be scripted?  Are you insane?  Scripted.  That's what I was supposed to say.  Scripted?  That's a bunch of bunk.  Scripted.  Mr. Faber-Sham, this show is not scripted.  It is not scripted. 
[03:32:30]  Lady Di, why does your phone keep hanging up?  I have no clue.  Yes.  My cordless phone.  The statement of the century.  I have no idea.  Well, what are your final words, considering your phone's getting shut off tomorrow?  My final words?  And what happens next?  Electricity goes?  What's up?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Nothing like that is going to go.  How much is the power?  What's that bill up to?  The power?  Yes, the electric bill.  How much is that up to?  A couple hundred dollars.  Why?  When was the last time you paid it? 
[03:33:00]  When I was working?  Asking or telling?  Which I'm not working anymore.  Yeah, when you were working.  I haven't worked in months, so your electricity is going to get turned off.  No, it's not going to get turned off.  That ain't going to get turned off.  How are you making money to pay your bills?  Well, no, no, no.  Right now, I'm on welfare.  Why don't you get a job?  Stop being so lazy.  And who's whispering in the background?  The guy that punched you in the face?  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  There's nobody whispering in the background.  I heard a little whispering.  Anyone else?  Anyone there at the house with you?  There's nobody whispering in the background.  Who's there?  Is anyone there with you?  She's so compacted.  A friend of mine's here with me, but he's not whispering.  Then how can we hear him and know he's there?  And didn't you just say no one's there?  No, no, no.  He's sitting on the couch right now.  There is somebody here.  But he's not whispering in the background.  Well, he's warming up his fist into a catcher's face.  No, he's not warming up his fist. 
[03:34:00]  And I never got hit anyway in the first time.  No, that's our observation.  That was, it looked an awful lot like a fist print on your jaw.  It certainly was and well deserved.  Because looking at your gut, it sure didn't look like you were on a treadmill.  Because she said she fell off a treadmill, right?  I haven't been on a treadmill in a long time.  Of course you haven't.  How long?  I don't know, a couple of years?  Columbo, thank you.  A ass.  You said you fell off a treadmill.  That's how you said you hurt you.  You can't even keep your lies straight anymore.  You said...  No, no, no.  I fell. 
[03:34:30]  I did fall off the treadmill.  But that doesn't mean I was on the treadmill.  Oh, my God.  I was in the porch and I fell by the treadmill.  You are such a lying sack.  I am not a lying sack.  Will you stop it?  You fell trying to get to the cooler of Budweiser because your refrigerator is not working anymore?  No, there's no...  You have to keep your beer outside?  There's a cooler in there, but there's no butt in there.  So you fell over a treadmill because that is such an object that... 
[03:35:00]  Oh, I heard her phone.  Her phone fell.  Good.  Her phone cuts off right when we would have hung up on her anyway.  I bet the alcohol in her breath just keeps messing the wires up.  Short circuits.  What a complete mess.  Oh, my God.  Balloon Not Joe has a good observation, and then we'll get back to this list.  That's very good, though.  Balloon Not.  Go ahead.  You know, I was just thinking that her life is like the Sims game in reverse.  She's just slowly disappearing piece by piece, and yet I wonder...  Not even in reverse.  Not even in reverse. 
[03:35:30]  I play the Sims like this.  And you could lose everything.  Yeah, where I stop feeding myself, stop going to the bathroom.  You lose the kids.  They come and take your kids.  Stop going to work.  Your phone gets shut off.  Your power gets shut off.  The real question is, how can someone so poor be so fat?  That's true.  Yeah.  How the hell does she keep that weight on?  All right.  There she goes.  That's true.  There he goes.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  All right.  So we're up to the...  Third, Opie.  Third. 
[03:36:00]  Popcorniest line in movie history.  What was four?  I don't remember.  That was a long time ago.  I think it was...  Oh, Ghost.  Ghost, yeah.  This line is from the movie, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  Another one of those bore fests.  I never saw it.  All right.  The line, is it still raining?  I hadn't noticed, uttered by Annie McDowell at the end of Four Weddings and a Funeral. 
[03:36:30]  Why would you see that?  That was just another...  You know, I watched it.  I tried to.  I sat there trying to watch it.  And nothing happens, the whole movie.  It is just the most boring nothing.  Like every one of his movies.  Unless he's getting a head from some black prostitute, I don't want to hear his name.  You're right, bro.  All right.  Let's move on.  The runner-up.  Thanks.  Corniest line in movie history.  From Dirty Dancing.  Anybody? 
[03:37:00]  Oh.  I don't know.  Is it right after the abortion scene?  From Dirty Dancing.  I love that one.  Patrick Swayze.  Patrick Swayze.  His famous line in the movie.  It was...  Oh, oh.  Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner.  What a faggot that I know that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  In honor of that, we'll play the retard singing.  Oh, one of my faves.  Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner.  Yeah.  Didn't, didn't, isn't that from the Peterson trial?  Why always back to that?  Six degrees of Scott Peterson.  I just need to understand why.  Because it always has to go back to that.  Because they named it.  It doesn't have to go there.  It just should.  The top.  Could say nobody puts Jump and A in a corner.  Absolutely.  Nobody puts those Smith boys. 
[03:38:00]  Nobody puts E8, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  Nobody puts Joel Steinberg's daughter, Lisa.  There's plenty of them.  The top corniest line in movie history.  Oh, the top one.  What movie are we looking at?  Well, what?  Pop corniest.  Oh, pop corniest.  Pop corniest.  You enjoy that, right?  Pop corniest.  It makes it so much more fun.  Well, as soon as I say the movie, you're going to know the line, so...  Really?  Well, I guess that's why we're doing this, so...  Yeah, the Titanic, obviously.  Oh.  Hmm. 
[03:38:30]  Is it that stupid hold on, Jack?  Don't ever let go?  No.  I don't think so.  That's the line from the movie.  Yeah.  The line.  Oh, I'm the king of the world?  I'm the king of the world.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I thought it was, um...  Help me out of the raft, you fat, selfish whore.  Yes, the Titanic.  As it slithered beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic. 
[03:39:00]  I dedicate this song to all the people on the Titanic, but mostly not to those who perished  beneath the icy waters, but to the survivors.  Jack, you idiot.  Get up on the boat.  Why is Ren from Ren and Stimpy singing this song?  Jack, get up on the boat, you idiot. 
[03:39:30]  Okay, Ren.  Hey, that water's awful cold, Ren.  Stimpy, clear me a place on the boat.  Oh, oh.  Big part?  Yeah, this is our favorite part.  Near.  Fall.  Will.  Oh, why did Jack have to die?  Bob Kelly, stop crying. 
[03:40:00]  I like seeing a midget trying to swim.  Those little arms.  Just not able to keep a nose above water enough to stop drowning.  And he's only trying to swim because Bob's tears are drowning him.  What a sad sack idiot you are.  You emotional boob.  If only they had climbed into the warm cavern that is my camel toe.  You ever see me perform at my Vegas show?  These wonderful dancers come out of my jumpsuited camel toe. 
[03:40:30]  Do a dance as I sing this song.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I wish I had my whistle I used to have at any W.  Where's my little tutti whistle?  I would play along at this part and not have to talk until near.  Right.  Oh, oh.  Is it coming now?  Nope.  Son of a bitch!  Yes.  Dedicated to all those that lived. 
[03:41:00]  These survivors.  Not long.  It's just around the corner.  Here it comes.  Now it's a wacky ride for kids.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  Near, far, wherever.  Wonderful song.  Can we turn this off, please?  A little finish.  A little finish.  It goes on for another year.  A little respect.  No, I'd rather play the retards singing the song from Ghost. 
[03:41:30]  The song goes on as long as it took this mighty ship to sink.  Want to hear the retards?  I love the retards doing the dirty dancing song.  In honor of the runner-up corniest line in movie history, let's play this.  And we're not going to take a break.  As soon as the song's over, we'll play What Did We Learn and finish up the O&A show for  today.  Is this the guy you called an insensitive scumbag who recorded this?  Yeah.  Time of my life.  Yeah.  It's from Dirty Dancing because he emailed me.  He said that was the greatest compliment he ever got when you called him an insensitive  scumbag.  He loved it. 
[03:42:00]  Most of the guys that work at these places were retarded people.  They really aren't really nice and doing it to be nice.  They're doing it because it's a job.  And maybe they went into it with some noble thinking.  But when you're there and doing it and getting bitten and punched and spit and shit and pissed  on by retarded people, you kind of lose that whole noble point of getting into the gig.  And you start doing things like this.  When you take them to a field trip to Great Adventure, then you see a recording booth. 
[03:42:30]  You throw them in there.  You make them record this song.  And then you give it out to your favorite radio show, the Opie and Anthony song.  And I do believe this is one of your favorites, right?  Yes, it is.  One of your favorite things we play?  Love it.  The emotion they put into it is great.  I had some time of my life.  Now I never felt this way before.  Yes, I swear it's the truth. 
[03:43:00]  And I owe it all to you.  Because I had the time of my life.  Now I always loved it for you.  I've been waiting for so long.  Now I finally found this one to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding on the wall. 
[03:43:30]  And you felt the magic called fantasy.  Yeah, every time you did it all right.  It's the way we couldn't die secretly.  Now we take each other's hands.  Cause we didn't understand.  No, don't cheat.  Just remember us.  You're the one who can't gain a lot. 
[03:44:00]  So I tell you something.  This could be true.  Because I have had the time of my life.  That I never felt that way before.  Yes, I swear it's the truth.  That I hold you. 
[03:44:30]  Say, say, say, say.  And my body and soul's gone.  You know that you'll never know.  Don't let it go.  Send your faith.  Don't lose control.  No.  Yeah, I know you saw your mind.  You stay, stay with me tonight 
[03:45:00]  Me, take a look, all the onesie  I can get enough of  They'll tell you something  This can't be love because  I've had the time of my life  No, I've never felt the same before  But I can't speak the truth 
[03:45:30]  I've had the time of my life  And I can't speak the truth  Now I've found  I've never felt the same before  I've never felt the same before  I've never felt the same before  I've never felt the same before 
[03:46:00]  Oh, I had the time all my life 
[03:46:30]  And I never felt this way before  And I swear this is the truth  And I owe it all to you  I had the time all my life  And I never felt this way before  And I swear this is the truth  I had the time all my life 
[03:47:00]  And I swear this is the truth  And I swear this is the truth  I had the time all my life  I had the time all my life  And I never felt this way before  And I swear this is the truth 
[03:47:30]  And I owe it all to you  I had the time all my life  And there you have it  Classic  One of Anthony's favorite  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Freeplay  All week long right here on XM 202 Anthony  Hey, it's a free play  To continue to receive Channel 202 on your XM radio  You'll need to add Opie and Anthony to your XM account  You can call 1-800-XM-RADIO or subscribe online
