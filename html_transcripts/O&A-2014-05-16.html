<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Super Show, Episode 3, opened with DJ Dennis Denny Falcone introducing the broadcast and playing music.  The show immediately launched into a "red carpet" event, ostensibly for a "Super Show Talent Show."  A significant portion of the early show centered on Lady Di, a recurring character, who had allegedly clogged a Starbucks toilet, sparking detailed and crude discussions about the incident’s specifics.  The hosts interviewed various guests arriving on the red carpet: Oscar, Patty (a Starbucks barista), Bobo, Big A, and Mike Bichetti. These interviews were marked by informal, often sexually suggestive questioning regarding their outfits and planned talent show performances.  The hosts also discussed Donald Sterling's legal battle with the NBA and a Twitter spat between Anthony and James Hetfield over a Guitar Center commercial.  The red carpet segment included a group selfie, mirroring the Oscars selfie, and the revelation that Lady Di had received a $100 offer to appear but traded it for a date with comedian Colin Quinn, who later arrived. Sandy Kane, another guest, was interviewed, her appearance prompting sexually suggestive commentary.  She recounted a recent arrest by the NYPD, embellishing the story with increasingly outrageous claims.  The conversation escalated into extremely vulgar and sexually explicit territory.

The talent show itself was chaotic. Bobo performed magic tricks, Big A delivered a stuttering stand-up routine filled with off-color puns and the catchphrase "Stamp it!", and Mike Bichetti showcased his tap dancing skills. Lady Di's belly dance elicited sexually suggestive comments from the hosts, culminating in her exposing her breasts to Colin Quinn.  Oscar’s freestyle rap performance deviated from expectations, and he discussed his marijuana use and dating life. Sandy Kane acted as a judge, providing crude commentary.  Throughout the talent show,  there were ongoing jokes about Lady Di's perceived lack of professional accomplishments, contrasted with other guests' achievements, and her response referenced a past tragedy.  Sandy Kane also performed her explicit song, "He Taught Me How To Love,"  leading to a discussion about its production and her past.  Patty performed impressions, which were critiqued by Sandy Kane.  Extended discussions about the physical attributes of women, and DJ Dennis Falcone’s reactions to various audio elements, also punctuated the broadcast.  The talent show ended with Oscar being declared the winner.  The entire broadcast was characterized by constant interruptions, overlapping conversations, extremely vulgar language, and sexually suggestive humor, reflecting the show's characteristic free-flowing and irreverent style.  Further discussions and jokes, often centered around Lady Di's behavior and her relationship with someone named Bill, concluded the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We got freaks, we got idiots, and monstrosities about.  The Super Show, the Super Show, the O.P. and Anthony Super Show!  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Super Show, Episode 3, The Adventure Continues.  Now are you ready for another action-packed, star-studded, celebrity jammed extravaganza?  Well, hi there, I'm your friendly neighborhood disc jockey, Dennis Denny Falcone.  Here are the play of the tunes for you.  Now if you feel like moving your feet, groove it to the beat, then get on up and boogie. 
[00:00:30]  We can't hear it for one thing, baby, let's have a good time, let's do it!  He hit the post.  Of course he did.  He hit the post.  Oh man, does he know how to start a party though?  Yes he does.  I think so.  Denny!  Clapping our hands, having a great time.  Really, Jim?  Amazing, Dennis.  I just talked to Sam just before the show.  Well, I think this whole show is geared toward having Jim Norton's brain explode. 
[00:01:00]  You have no idea.  It's everyone he hates.  Everyone.  I actually don't hate any.  Well, for the show, I'm just saying.  No, no, no.  I know you don't hate anyone.  But I do really want to strangle them sometimes when they're...  I don't mind them individually.  Well, all together, it's going to be a perfect storm.  They're despicable people.  They're talking about fire tornadoes, whatever they call them, out there in San Diego.  We got one in this studio today.  Yes.  And then, to put it over the top, Roland... 
[00:01:30]  Friday night.  Roland ordered food.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy.  Did you see him?  He twitched a little and fucking...  Like I said, this whole show is geared toward giving Jimmy a nervous breakdown.  I think it's nice of food, Colin, but they just leave it outside and bring it in while on the break.  Exactly.  Why would we eat on the air?  Well, why don't we interview Roland?  What kind of food do we have for the Super Show today?  Hard Rock Johnny is bringing it in. 
[00:02:00]  Hard Rock Johnny?  Yeah, we like Hard Rock Johnny.  It would be nice to see Johnny.  I haven't seen him in a while.  I'm not going to be eating the Hard Rock food.  I love this song.  This is great.  Right.  The Cassidy.  What?  They'll feed the animals.  Yes, that's it.  Oh, okay.  Who is this in what year, Denny?  Bell and James, 1979.  1979.  Oh, boy.  This just in.  Lady Di already clogged the Starbucks toilet.  Is she still banned from the toilets here? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  The toilet ban continues.  She asked me if she was still, but she said, now, am I still banned from the bathroom?  Because I'd like to be able to use the bathroom up there.  Well, if you were a civilized human being that knew how to use a fucking bathroom, perhaps  you could use it.  I've never heard of anyone getting banned from a bathroom before.  That's the type of people that we have for the super show.  How does she make a ban from bathroom?  How do we know she clogged it already?  Yeah.  What happened?  Because she walked out of the, the intern already had to walk her down.  After he had to pick her up from her house, he had to walk her down to take her on her 
[00:03:00]  walk.  Yeah.  And run or walk like a dog.  I love it.  She was, woo, Friday night.  Living it up, living it up, oh yeah.  Woo, woo.  Friday night.  Living it up, living it up.  It's Friday morning, buddy.  Holy shit.  Living it up, living it up, oh yeah.  Friday night.  Yeah.  Living it up.  Jim's not clapping.  Jim's not clapping.  Jim, why?  Come on, Jim.  All right.  All right. 
[00:03:30]  Denny, hit it.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Super Show, Volume 3.  You know, we are all very, very fortunate because we're here on Friday.  It's love and kisses time.  Y'all remember this song from the movie, Thank God It's Friday.  Here we go.  Yeah.  I love it.  A lot of Friday songs.  Yeah, come on.  What about Friday, Friday?  And what about The Cure? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  What is it?  It's Friday.  I'm in love or something.  Ah, yeah.  Anyway, Sam, how do we know she clogged the...  Ooh.  Donna Summer was in this movie.  He's doing the hustle.  Yeah, he's doing the hustle.  I wish you would.  Out the door.  So how do we know she clogged the bathroom?  The intern walked her in there?  Yeah, he walked her downstairs and in there, and then she came out of the bathroom and said...  She called him Guy because she forgot his name and said that... 
[00:04:30]  She said, I don't know if you'll know what I mean, but I went and it wasn't able to all flush.  Oh, big fucking Hindenburg log.  Did we take a picture?  Oh, God.  Of the toilet?  Yes.  The intern did not.  Yeah, she got to do all this.  He dropped the ball.  He dropped the ball right there.  The intern told me...  She said, if they had a brush, I would have cleaned it, but they've got people to do that.  To clean up her shit.  Her giant alky logs.  That was a big day.  Oh, God. 
[00:05:00]  Alky logs.  That's just terrible.  There's probably a thick, like, a shiny black coating, like fucking, like, coal or whatever.  Oh, God.  You know there's a shine to it, like a grease.  There's like a level of grease in the water after she's done.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Seems to mind.  Yeah.  Oily.  Disgusting.  Oh, we got some action outside Fox & Friends today.  Maybe E-Rock could go through the Spartan race.  Oh, what are they doing?  Oh, yeah, look at that.  They got the giant tractor tires that they roll over.  Well, the Spartan race has become extremely popular. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Anyway, so, all right.  Denny Falcone is all dressed.  Yeah, and he's got a silver lame vest on with a nice silver tie and a black dress shirt.  Silver and gold, baby.  It's solid gold.  Silver and gold.  Solid gold.  Did you walk the red carpet yet, Dennis?  I rolled it out with Sam.  He had to roll it out.  That's kind of sad.  Here's that song you asked for, though, by the Cuber. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, thank you.  Why don't you...  It's Friday on my lap.  We'll have that alternative rock action for you.  A special request from our good friend, Opie.  Oh, thank you.  By request.  It's the all request and dedication hour.  I never got a request on the air so quickly.  Usually I've got to wait hours when I call the radio station.  I don't care if Monday.  Yeah.  I walked in and saw the red carpet.  And I've got to be honest, I was getting a little excited about the super show.  Good for you.  Seeing the red carpet down there and then the backdrop and everything. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Just waiting to see the flashes go off from the paparazzi.  Well, Getty Images is officially outside.  I see.  Waiting, yes.  Waiting to take pictures for press purposes.  And these, of course, Getty Images, the people that take pictures of all the giant celebrities  on the red carpet.  Right.  Never here last Friday to take photos of Jon Hamm from Mad Men.  Right.  And this Friday they'll be here to take photos of all the guests that we have coming. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  For Super Show 3.  We have Fat Ham.  Well, I want Dennis Falcone to walk the red carpet officially.  Yeah, yeah.  I think everybody at some point has to get out there and walk the carpet.  Yeah, scheduled to appear on the super show today.  Super Show 3.  Oh.  Mike Bichetti, who I saw outside.  Mike Bichetti.  Me and Kenny saw Mike Bichetti outside.  And he did not recognize us.  We pulled up to a light.  Mike Bichetti is, no joke, a quarter inch from his phone.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:07:30]  Reading tweets or something.  Me and Kenny look right at him.  He looks up, looks right at us.  Yeah.  There's no recognition that he...  No.  He recognizes us.  Uh-huh.  Gets paranoid, turns around and walks halfway up the block and stops against a wall and then  continues to look at his phone a quarter inch from his face.  Jesus.  He's blind.  I don't know how he gets by.  I don't know, man.  We were so close to him.  And he did not recognize us.  So he's going to be here today for Super Show 3.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you got to pump it up, though, you know.  DJ Dennis Falcone.  Yeah.  In the house.  We all have our favorites, except for Jimmy, I think.  I have my favorite.  It's 10.30.  Who is your favorite on this list, if you had to say?  Because my favorite, well, my favorite is Oscar, and he is here.  Believe it or not, he is my favorite.  Wow.  I request him all the time.  Then you got the Big A. 
[00:08:30]  Big A.  All right.  Big A returning.  Big A is probably my favorite.  Big A?  Yeah, I have no issue with Big A.  I love that, Andrew.  He is fun.  Stalker Patty will be appearing.  I like Patty.  Patty, what, does she use her vacation time from Starbucks?  We have her for 45 minutes.  It's a vacay time.  Let's see.  Bobo.  Bobo, of course.  Is he dressing up for the occasion?  Oh, Jimmy's disgusted.  Yeah, but what's he doing here? 
[00:09:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I have drum rolls for you, too.  Oh, nice.  I don't know if it's a drum roll situation.  Oh, it is.  I think it's more like a celebration type song.  Terrible drums.  Right.  Tap should be more like that.  It sounds like one of those, like, wind-up monkeys on the fucking drum.  Right.  It's more like Gary Glitter or one of those songs you hear at a sporting event.  It's a good one.  It's a good one. 
[00:09:30]  Woo!  Yeah!  Or this.  My favorite rendition of this song, when Eric Estrada sang it on Chips.  Celebramas.  Roller skating.  What's Chips TV show?  Oh, Chips.  Oh, Chips, huh?  Yeah!  Eric Estrada sang it.  We're gonna have a good time tonight. 
[00:10:00]  It's great.  Roller disco episode, I think.  Lady Di is here for Super Show 3 and has already clogged the toilet.  The Starbucks toilet.  Oh, yeah!  Look at it.  Look at it.  Is this, uh, Gary Glitter, Rock and Roll Part 2?  Is that an actual, uh...  Yeah, we're looking at a video.  Eric Estrada.  Music.  Eric Estrada.  How bad is this? 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  He thought he had a singing career.  Is this on Chips?  Oh, yeah.  This is on Chips.  You know how good he must have felt about this?  Oh, he thought this is gonna launch him into his second career.  He's got, like, a disco shirt on.  Tucked in orange.  Sexy love.  Oh, he's trying to be all sexy. 
[00:11:00]  Making love to the camera.  They're trying to, like, film it like Saturday Night Fever, too.  Why was the patrolman singing this song?  How did they tie this in?  I have no idea.  There's nine people clapping.  Yes.  Look, look.  He's doing, like, the poses.  Oh, it's so bad.  And the bright lights of all the cops are there watching him.  All his cop buddies are, you know, clapping.  He's always making love with his eyes to the ladies at the end of the stage.  I'm embarrassed.  He's humping, too, a little bit. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that was a great episode.  If you get a chance to see it.  Humping his penis forward.  Yeah.  All right, Dennis, back to you.  Harvey Keitel sang better in the bed, Lieutenant.  There's another one of the sports anthems.  Oh.  A hockey anthem, you might say.  This is Zombie Nation.  Oh.  All right.  That's okay.  So we got Lady Di.  It's the crowd pumping up.  We're, like we said, clogged the toilet already.  No one's favorite, by the way.  Let's see.  Also, scheduled to appear, Sandy Kane.  Ah.  Scheduled to appear. 
[00:12:00]  Now, we had a little controversy in that she wanted to be paid $1,000 for her appearance.  How did that pan out, Sam?  Well, she's not getting $1,000.  Uh-huh.  I told her, number one, that she needed to repair her relationship with you guys because  she no-showed last time.  There's equity in that alone.  Nice.  Good for you.  And I also told her that Opie and Anthony always have at least $200 cash in their pockets  so we can get on the air and just ask them for some cash.  There you go.  And that probably won't work out. 
[00:12:30]  Son of a bitch.  No.  And then we'll just tell her, no.  Uh, and finally, he will be here.  The reason we're doing the Super Show, Super Show 3 today, Colin Quinn.  The big star.  The big star.  The big dish.  Colin Quinn.  Uh, any surprise guests?  Right now, no surprise guests.  I was thinking, like, uh, Cream Pie Jones or something.  Efforts were made for surprise guests.  You reached out?  Many times.  What about intern David?  I got very rude responses from Cream Pie Jones. 
[00:13:00]  Boy, does he want nothing to do with his character anymore.  And no response from intern David.  Really?  Intern David.  We got him jerked off.  He won't come on the show.  Intern David won't.  No.  Why?  His parents probably shamed him.  His parents stink.  That's my assumption.  We got him a Yankee Cranky, man.  Yeah.  That was a great day in his life.  What the fuck?  I've never seen a boy smile that far.  Why am I saying his parents stink?  They're mad that we got him jerked off for money.  Exactly.  Come on.  They're trying to take this borderline autistic guy to have a full life. 
[00:13:30]  We just want him to get jerked off and insult people.  And smell like dog shit in the elevator.  I'm criticizing them.  What the fuck?  When you put it like that, Jimmy.  Yeah, they're right.  He did used to tell me that they got very upset that he would come home every day reeking  with dog shit.  Yeah.  All right.  And we got donuts here from Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, how about that?  Who sprung for the eight donuts?  I think Troy Kwan. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, so.  So, this is a really good concept.  These guys all have to do a talent today.  Yes.  It's the Super Show Talent Show.  Talent Show.  Now, you would think that would be a complete disaster because none of these guys would be  able to come up with any type of talent.  They don't have talent, right.  So, they've been assigned talents.  Oh, that's interesting.  You have that sheet, Sam.  Because it's kind of funny just to read what each person is going to do.  They don't actually know what their talents are yet. 
[00:14:30]  I haven't told all of them.  Oh, really?  No.  Even if they're listening to the radio, they'll forget.  Well, who do you want to start with?  Just right from the top.  Lady Di will be performing a belly dance routine.  And there's props.  A sensual belly dance.  There's props, too.  That will play well on radio.  Yes, a belly dance.  Exactly.  Cool.  Who's going to be doing mime?  Bobo will be here to perform some magic.  Great. 
[00:15:00]  Great.  A little sleight of hand.  Sleight of hand.  Yes.  Let's see.  Big A will be treated to the comic stylings.  Of Big A.  Of Big A.  A little comedy from Big A.  All right.  Yes.  And you know the punchlines might have some STs in there.  Why wouldn't they?  Too-joo.  Too-joo.  Too-joo.  Mike Pichetti will be performing the stunt that he's performed for Opie before. 
[00:15:30]  He'll be hula hooping.  No.  Not again.  Well, we also have tap dancing available.  Oh, that's good.  We have some tap shoes.  We do.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's really fit in the tap shoes.  Yeah, we've got the biggest tap shoes we could find.  And do we have a floor?  We'll find something to tap on.  All right.  I think he should do some tap dance.  Some tap dance?  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  And finally, Oscar.  Right.  Will be freestyle rapping.  Oh, wow.  A little freestyle.  He didn't know that until just now.  He didn't?  No.  All right.  So maybe he could freestyle about the whole gang. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  He could start writing or whatever.  You know, right?  Yeah.  So that's awesome.  Very cool.  All right.  That's what's going to happen today.  Nice.  A lot of talents to get.  And of course, we'll have full coverage of the red carpet as the morning continues.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That I want to see when all the celebrities arrive.  Yes.  Cavalcade of goose eggs.  Just follow the whole thing on our Twitter, O&A Show.  Yes.  Lots of pictures will be posted today.  Yes.  And Facebook, O&A Show. 
[00:16:30]  Fantastic.  Dennis, back to you.  Pump this shit up.  We are here to celebrate not the first, not the second, but the third.  Oh, wow.  It just keeps growing.  The super show.  So please do not stop the party.  Make sure you stick around all morning long.  Right here on the O&A Extravaganza.  We have to send out a happy birthday wish.  If you happen to run it to lovely.  Yeah.  Just want to do some birthday announcements, too.  I love it.  Happy birthday to who?  I love it.  Well, listen and find out. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Go ahead.  If you happen to run it to Michael or Jermaine's little sister, Janet Jackson, make sure  you give her a big hug and wish her a happy 48th birthday today.  And let's get on this one.  Back into the naughty 90s.  It's an escapade on the O&A Extravaganza.  You're going to get someone arrested.  You can't just walk up to Janet Jackson and give her a birthday hug.  Sure you can.  Sure you can.  Yeah.  I'm sure she'd like it.  You sure?  Why not?  It's a good song.  Oh, you like this one?  Oh, yeah.  He's dancing. 
[00:17:30]  He loves to put me down.  People want to know why Vos came in a day early.  All right.  Well.  Great.  What a party.  Wonderful.  What a party.  I had fun on Twitter last night.  I happened to mention that I saw a commercial with, what's his name?  James Hetfield. 
[00:18:00]  James Hetfield from Metallica for Guitar Center.  Is that real?  Yeah.  That's a little weird.  It's like a 60-second spot that was taken from, I guess, a 15-minute interview that he did.  He's sitting on a stool, he's got a guitar, like at a Guitar Center, it looks like, or  in his fucking basement or something.  I don't know.  But it's a commercial for Guitar Center.  So I was like, what a sellout, man.  I got so much shit from dummies that thought I was serious, that thought I actually gave 
[00:18:30]  a flying fuck if James Hetfield did a Guitar Center commercial.  People just like, you're an asshole.  You wish you could be in commercial.  Like, real people that are pissed off that I was saying that James Hetfield sold out.  What?  There are so many dummies on Twitter that have no concept of sarcasm, jokes.  You could read it.  When M-A-A-A-A-A-N, like, man, in big capital letters, like, I give a shit. 
[00:19:00]  It was very obvious that you were just going, man!  I was just, like, goofing around.  Who cares if James Hetfield does a Guitar Center commercial?  But, wow.  Do these idiots come to the fucking table to defend a guy that wouldn't give them the time  of fucking day from a joke?  Can you give me a minute?  I gotta delete a few tweets.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Is that the... 
[00:19:30]  Awkward.  Awkward.  Awkward.  Awkward.  I said it, I don't know, earlier this week.  Oh.  Twitter's just a shitty place.  Yeah.  And as soon as you realize that, you'll be a happier person.  Uh-huh.  Just a shitty place to hang.  Yeah.  I'm just more of a promoter now on my Twitter.  It's just an evil, dark place.  It's just really shitty.  Dungeon-like, yes.  Brings out the worst in people.  Yeah.  Probably myself as well.  I'm including myself, but... 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw you battling those people last night.  What, are you kidding me?  But that's, you know, that's Twitter.  That's what you get.  Right.  It's a real population, a cross-section of the world.  Before we get the Super Show going, breaking news, Donald Sterling is basically saying,  fuck you to the NBA, just like we said he would.  Oh, yeah.  He's not accepting the fine levied on him, the $2.5 million, and he's getting ready to 
[00:20:30]  sue the NBA.  So now what?  Now what do those players do?  He is not going away, and if it turns into a lawsuit type of thing, that could go on for  a year or two.  They'll play under him because he's in the process.  They'll play.  Yeah.  They won't walk because the NBA will say, well, our hands are tied.  We do what we have to do.  We can't physically shoot the guy.  I mean, we've got to let him play out legally.  Right.  They'll play.  Of course he's going to sue.  It was a moral thing.  The ethics guide or whatever the fuck they violated, and he's saying he didn't.  Right.  And technically, he probably didn't in his private life to say those things. 
[00:21:00]  I think the NBA is going to lose that lawsuit in the end.  Well, they say that they're...  As much as, you know, we all learn that he's a racist and he says shitty things, but how  that info was gathered, that's going to be a tough one for the NBA to defend against.  They say that the NBA, though, whatever it's called, a constitution, gives them a lot of  latitude.  So even in court, you know, what seems like some type of infringement on your rights and 
[00:21:30]  shit like that gets thrown out the window when you go by their little constitution.  They apparently can throw you the fuck out of any of the venues and try to take your team  away and all that shit.  Right.  But it'll be tied up in court for a long time.  For a while.  It will, right?  These things never go quickly.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's never a three-month process.  Yeah, no.  When a billionaire sues a major sports group, you know, it's not a fucking quick...  Uh-huh.  I think you'll see it next year when players start tapping out and not coming to the 
[00:22:00]  Clippers, whatever.  You think that'll happen?  Yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  Yeah, they're not going to continue.  You know, those guys that are at the end of their contracts or possibly, you know, have  a chance to go there, they'll just say, nah, go somewhere else.  That money is awful powerful.  No, I mean, if they have a choice between the Clippers and, let's say, I don't know,  whoever.  The Knicks.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They'll start picking the Knicks over, you know, the Clippers or anyone over the Clippers.  Unless they're offered more money. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, I think that's going to be a tough place to play starting next year.  You've also got to look at the way these stories go.  By next year, this story's going to be like, oh, remember that?  Right.  You know?  Well, not for the players, though.  Maybe.  Not for the players.  Maybe for the rest of us, but we'll move on to other dumb stories.  I don't know.  A lot of people don't have what's called scruples.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  This guy has a beef with you, Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  A beef.  Nate in Hoboken.  Nate.  Hey, Han, I thought it was pretty ironic that you were bitching about the intelligence of  the people on Twitter, and you said, there is so many stupid people on Twitter.  There is so many dummies.  Okay.  And I should have said, there are so many dummies on Twitter.  Oh, I got you.  But there are only dummies.  I'm having a conversation here, and, you know, occasionally the grammar does suffer,  but I think the point got across, sir. 
[00:23:30]  Sir.  Nate.  Sir.  Nate.  He went away.  He won.  Nate from Hoboken!  All right.  Well, there you go.  Would you ever...  He an asshole.  Would you ever call a radio station to...  I wouldn't.  First of all, I wouldn't call a radio station.  Ever.  Yes, he was.  Mancow was on you, wouldn't you?  Oh, that's true.  That was a great call.  I rule.  And to tell the host that... 
[00:24:00]  How lame is your life that you...  Wow.  You have to look up the phone number.  You call the phone number.  Get through.  Get through.  You've got to wait a while.  Through the screener.  All that...  Wait.  ...to say what he said.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  He didn't appreciate...  Officially, I don't understand, people.  ...of my statement.  Danny, take us to break.  All right.  It's Super Show 3.  We're about ready to get the red carpet going right after the break, but take us to the break  there, sir.  Well, I think being here on the Super Show 3, we have got a cavalcade of superstars, and 
[00:24:30]  you will see some real sexy people, so make sure you keep it right here on the Opie  and Anthony Show.  Good morning and welcome back to Super Show 3.  Reach around, slap yourself on the back.  You ought to be real proud of yourself because, hey, you made it to Friday, and what we're  going to try to do here is the impossible and make each and every body in the audience  today feel special.  But the guy I want to make feel special is just about five feet in front of me.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is for you, Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you, Danny.  I just saw the cavalcade of stars walk up the hallway, and it was a little too much to soak  in right there.  I felt like I was watching Sunday morning cartoons.  You didn't have that feel to it.  Like, just a whole bunch of characters.  Cartoon characters.  Cartoon characters.  Walking down the hallway. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  I want to say hi.  They're not listening right now, but I want to say hi to the Brooklyn boys.  The Brooklyn boys are outside the studio today.  Oh, yeah.  Brooklyn, I'm saying hi to you.  They don't even know.  They're here to listen to the show, and they're not listening.  This is amazing.  I see the paparazzi out there.  Yeah.  Slabarazzi.  Those guys pretty much run the Barclays Center.  I am?  And they're huge fans of our show.  Yeah, it's nice.  Oh, really? 
[00:26:00]  And they're huge.  They could have got me into the old rock and roll.  I'm saying hi to you guys.  You want to listen?  Okay, now they're listening again.  Ow.  Yeah, they're very, very cool.  Yeah.  They've done a lot for a few of us around here.  Are we ready for the red carpet?  Sam Roberts.  Oh, you bet we are.  The guests are lining up.  Yeah, yeah.  We saw them.  I noticed some people aren't taking this seriously and did not do the black tie thing.  Excuse me.  Well, one person in particular found out a little late.  Okay.  And that was not his fault. 
[00:26:30]  But other than that, yeah, there are people taking it more seriously than others.  Now, are any guests not here right now?  Right now, obviously, Colin Quinn is not here yet.  Well, yeah.  We're doing this for him.  I know.  Fuck.  What did we call him?  Um, and one person is not here yet.  But it's so early.  All right.  All right.  I know who that is.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all know.  Sandy and Colin are probably fucking.  Wow. 
[00:27:00]  So are you going to go out there and do the whole red carpet thing?  Yeah, I guess they'll come through one by one.  The paparazzi is out there to take their picture next to our step and repeat.  Right.  And, uh.  Well, it's a step.  Yeah, it's probably not a lot of repeating.  Yeah, what happened to the repeat part?  It's just a step.  Wow.  What is a step and repeat?  Huh?  What is a step and repeat?  A step and repeat is the big banner with all the logos on it where when you're on the red carpet.  Right.  You stand there and that's the photography section. 
[00:27:30]  Ah.  So you can go and, like, the Academy Awards will have the Oscars logo.  Right.  And so all the pictures of these stars at the Oscars will have the Oscars logo.  I gotcha.  Okay.  And they repeat because there's more cameras.  Right.  So it's a long wall of logos.  You step, you get your picture taken, then you repeat, meaning you move a little forward.  Move a little further.  But with us, we have just the step part.  Yeah.  Right.  Not the repeat.  With them, it's going to be step in and repeat the same shit you said last time. 
[00:28:00]  So what are you going to ask?  Step and reach hard.  Oh, there it is.  Check it.  What are you going to ask them?  What they're wearing, of course.  Well, obviously, the question on everybody's mind is who they're wearing.  Of course.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Who they're wearing.  And then if they're excited about the Super Show 3 and are they ready.  Yeah, you know what you're doing.  And, like, sort of, if any, if they're excited, because, like, at the Academy Awards, some of  the actors are excited to see the other actors. 
[00:28:30]  That's true.  I haven't seen Robert Downey Jr.  Like, oh, look, George Clooney's over there.  Oh, hey.  Something like that.  Like James Spader will see Robert Downey Jr.  Like, hey, remember I made you suck dicks in that movie?  Like, I'm always anxious to find out who's really friends behind the scenes.  Behind the scenes.  A lot of them.  Will there be some small talk on the red carpet between the celebrities?  Oh, I would imagine.  Small talk?  Like, once the celebrities start coming through, things start to back up, and then they just  kind of small talk a little bit.  And, Sam Roberts, could this be maybe a little springboard for you to go over to Entertainment 
[00:29:00]  Weekly Radio?  I don't know, but I would like to display my prowess.  You've got to show them what they're missing.  Right.  Here's me interviewing a talking turtle.  And, Dennis, what do we got?  What kind of music do you think for the red carpet?  I was going to use the That's Entertainment and Hooray for Hollywood.  Why would you use that?  I just wanted to use some kind of glitzy and glamorous stuff. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, certainly.  All right, Dennis, why don't you bring us to the red carpet, then?  Oh, we're all ready for that?  Great.  All right.  Go ahead.  What are you going to say?  Mars?  What?  Mike 8.  Oh, Mike 8.  Mike 8.  Mike 8.  Oh, then I like Mike.  Mike 8-9.  All right, go ahead, Dennis.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment you've been waiting for here on Super Show  3.  We've rolled out the red carpet.  We've vacuumed it.  We've gotten all the stains out of it.  I'm excited.  And now it's time for our correspondent, Sam, the Radio Man Roberts, to Radio Man. 
[00:30:00]  You got it.  I just like those little cute things to do.  Our correspondent on the red carpet, Sam, take it away, and please introduce all our guests.  Well, thank you, self-sucking Denny Falcone.  We are out here.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  He doesn't do that.  He doesn't like that.  We're out here on the red carpet, and the stars are already starting to shine.  Oh, wow.  You can see.  Oscar, Oscar.  Oscar, do you have a second? 
[00:30:30]  Oscar, if I could grab you for a second.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  He almost walked right past.  For the people that don't know, Oscar's a very nervous person.  Oh, yeah.  He's extremely nervous.  Oscar, first of all, who are you wearing?  I'm wearing just a local dude from Jersey.  That's it, man.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means, man.  He's not sure what that means.  I got a text from you this morning.  He said, hey, it's nice if you can.  I was already on the train.  I was like, fuck.  This doesn't sound like a red carpet exchange.  No.  This is the best one we're going to get. 
[00:31:00]  Oscar, who are you most excited about seeing perform in today's talent show?  I'm going to say Bobo.  Definitely Bobo.  Bobo, who will be performing Magic later today.  Oscar, you are scheduled to freestyle rap.  Are you prepared?  Not at all, man.  And I suck at it, too.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  We'll do it.  What happens?  Are you nervous today?  Always.  We'll do it.  What happens?  I'm on stage shitless.  He said, maybe a little sample of his freestyle rapping that we all have come to love.  Is there a quick couple bars, as they say, a few lines of rap that we could give to the people right now? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know, man.  I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is Mickey Avalon, my dick.  How does that one go?  My dick costs a late-night fee.  That's it.  That's all I know.  Oh, God.  That's the beginning.  What a zilch.  It doesn't rhyme with anything.  He is a zero.  Yeah.  What have you been doing with your time since we last saw you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just busy, man.  Working.  You know, just cutting stuff off.  Look at the cameras.  Clicking away here.  Staying with a lot of girls?  Any girls in your life, huh?  Oh, absolutely.  I was last week.  Actually, I was in Hoboken, right? 
[00:32:00]  All night, just fucking partying it up, man.  It was dancing with every single girl they were on, you know, by themselves on the dance  floor.  It's great.  It was great.  This sounds just like when Brad Pitt hit the red carpet.  The question on everybody's mind, is any of those girls the one?  Oh.  Oh.  Hell no, man.  It's awful stuff, man.  Well, thanks, Oscar, for stopping by.  Wow.  I'll show him off to get his official picture in front of the step.  It's amazing, the flashes I see going off.  That's right.  Our red carpet man, Jizz Bacchetto. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, a lovely lady making her way onto the carpet, Sam.  Patty, do you have a second?  Patty, would you stop for a moment?  Oh, God.  All the time in the world.  Unfortunately, she's, well, talk about her attire a little bit.  I mean, Patty looks great.  She's wearing a beautiful dress.  It's black with some sparkles on it.  And a very old lady-ish cardigan sweater. 
[00:33:00]  Old lady-ish.  Ask her if she's still a virgin, Sam, please.  Patty, the people are wondering, are you still a virgin?  Yes, I am.  And your age, for the people that don't know.  I will be 59 in two weeks.  What?  Holy shit.  We've been at this way too fucking long.  At this time, I don't care about numbers anymore.  Right.  Well, zero would be the number for you.  Zero.  Who are you wearing?  We talked about your dress.  You know what?  I don't know.  I'm wearing Kmart. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, of course.  What's your talent that you're going to be showing all of us today?  Oh, a little bit of the something to the karaoke.  If you have a computer.  A little singing.  We always love what happens.  If we have the computer.  If we have the computer.  And ask her, did she have to take a few minutes of her vacation time to get here today?  Patty, the people want to know.  Of course, they know you.  A famous barista from Starbucks coffee.  How many minutes of vacation did you have to take for today? 
[00:34:00]  Right now, I'm up to 10 hours.  10 hours, ladies.  10 hours of vacation.  She's been there for fucking years.  If I wait another couple of months, I could take a whole week off and get paid for 40.  Hey, 40 hours.  Let's hear it for Patty, everybody.  As Patty keeps moving down the red carpet.  Thanks for stopping by.  I love the flashes that go off.  It's so exciting.  It's really amazing.  Oh, God damn it.  The beauty just continues.  Lady Di, do you have a moment?  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  I have all the time in the world.  Patty already said that.  But ask her about the clogged toilet, please.  Yes.  The question on everybody's mind, breaking news today, you broke a toilet in Starbucks,  correct?  I did not.  Did it flush is the question.  You went down and did you make a number one or a number two this morning?  I made a number two, okay?  Stop sticking that thing in my face.  I made a number two.  And did we flush it all the way down?  Be honest.  Yes, we did.  We flushed it all the way down.  I tried to anyway.  Oh, boy.  That's not good. 
[00:35:00]  Well, then it didn't go down.  Three times.  Three times.  She said three times.  Wow.  Great.  What happened?  Was it a big one?  Was it a nice, big, hefty dump?  Yes.  Like an anaconda.  Right.  Ask me if it was soupy or solid.  The people want to know, Lady Di.  Everybody's wondering.  People magazine's been reporting, but nobody knows for sure.  Was it soupy or solid, the dump?  It was solid, okay?  Just keep asking your dump questions. 
[00:35:30]  Just keep going.  Now, the other question that's on everybody's mind was,  uh, beyond consistency color.  Are we thinking green, brownish, darker?  Was it a tar color?  The dump we're talking about.  Brown.  Oh.  A light brown, a dark brown?  Light brown, okay.  How many pieces was it?  Oh.  What are you asking?  And the people wanted, well, the people are wondering here on the red carpet for the super  show, how many pieces exactly was it?  I don't know.  An estimate.  I don't know.  Come on.  We can't publish I don't know.  The people want to know. 
[00:36:00]  Three.  Three pieces.  Three big pieces.  How many times did you try to flush it?  Now, you tried to flush it how many times?  Three times.  And when we call you, how many natty ices have you usually had?  I didn't have any natty ices.  Three is the answer.  You kind of go with that number a lot.  Four.  Four.  Oh, that's right.  Now, was it the problem with the flushing?  Was it the length of the bowel movement or the thickness?  Oh, good question.  Thickness.  Thickness.  Oh, God.  Okay, that's it.  A giant, thick arm. 
[00:36:30]  Good fuck.  It's just a big fucking prolapsed ass doesn't have any fucking tightness to it.  Well, yeah, she took him in the ass for the entire 80s decade.  That's true.  Questions are coming in via Twitter.  Of course, Lady Di is trending for our red carpet show here.  And they want to know, is the reason that the thickness of the bowel movement was there,  did that have anything to do with spending the 1980s having anal sex?  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  That was a long time ago, and that was it. 
[00:37:00]  And does the anus expand, or is it always kind of just wide?  I don't know.  Well, I mean, it's your anus.  I don't know.  Why do you ask me questions like that?  That's what the people want to know.  And the wiping, and then we can move on.  How was the wiping?  The question on everybody's mind was the wiping.  Did we wipe thoroughly?  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  And was it a dry wipe, a wet wipe?  Dry or wet?  Dry.  Dry or wet.  Just as dry as wet.  I'm hearing last night that Lady Di had ten natty ices and hard-boiled eggs. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, there is a rumor.  Wondering around, and we'd really like to clear this up.  I think it's on TMZ.  TMZ has just reported breaking news that last night you spent your evening having ten natty ices  and several hard-boiled eggs.  Was that your meal?  Yeah, that was my meal last night.  I guess it was.  How many hard-boiled eggs?  Four.  Oh, my God.  I can't even get one hard-boiled egg, Darren.  Holy shit. 
[00:38:00]  Four hard-boiled eggs.  Yeah.  Ten natty ices.  Do you think that had anything to do with your hefty bowel movement this morning?  It's horrendous.  Probably.  Jesus Christ.  Now, the question, it's been raised, apparently there was a quote about you saying that you  would clean the toilet if you had a brush.  If there was a brush over there, I would have cleaned it.  But since there was no brush, true or false, you said there are people to do that.  Yeah, they are.  There are people that clean up over there, sure. 
[00:38:30]  Were there giant stains in the toilet that you wanted to brush away?  Now, one reporter has cited something saying that there were giant stains.  Like tar.  Tar stains.  Tar stains kind of scraping the side of the bowl that you left behind.  True?  Comment?  No, that's not true.  Next.  Did the inside of the toilet look like the starting line at English Town, New Jersey, the drag strip?  Hang on, hang on.  Before the next lobby, die, come back.  Come back.  We've got to now get into what she's wearing.  And I hear a rumor that the front of her dress is popping open from her belly. 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  The photographer still needs to take your picture.  Oh, lady die, lady die.  Come on.  Come on forward.  Before we go any further, who are you wearing today?  What?  Who are you wearing?  Who am I wearing?  Correct.  What do you mean, who?  She's never heard.  I'm wearing my clothes today.  She never heard that at the Oscars.  Blithering idiot.  Designer.  Who is the designer?  I don't know.  Where did you get the clothes?  Oh, I got them from, you know, from this store that I know that sells nice clothes. 
[00:39:30]  Salvishonermy.  Yes.  And there are a lot of people that are saying that your belly is sticking out of the bottom of your shirt.  True?  Yeah.  Yes.  That is true.  The buttons are really strange.  Oh, it's great.  Nothing to be ashamed of.  The point is you feel sexy, correct?  Yeah, I think so.  And what's up with the boa?  And the, well, the boa will be part of her talent, I'm assuming.  The boa, part of the belly dance for later? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  That sounds exciting.  The proverbial five-pound bag with ten pounds of shit in it.  Yeah.  Well, thank you for stopping by later.  Please keep going.  Keep going down the red carpet.  The photographers are waiting for you.  Oh, yeah.  As the stars, everybody.  Oh, that's Bobo.  Bobo is here.  Bobo.  Oh, look at Bobo.  Bobo, welcome to the red carpet, Bobo.  I see you're wearing a blazer.  It looks like a full suit with a bowling shirt under it.  Who are you wearing?  I'm not quite sure who made this stuff. 
[00:40:30]  I just had it for a while.  This is ridiculous.  Is that a hanky in your pocket?  No.  This isn't even.  It's just attached to the pocket.  Attached to the pocket.  It's a little highlight, huh?  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's great.  Is this your first red carpet that you've walked this year?  Yes, it is.  Excited for tonight?  Yeah, I'm excited for tonight. 
[00:41:00]  Now, what talent will you be performing for everybody?  I'll be doing magic.  Oh, and speaking of magic, there are a lot of people saying that you have a dog.  Is that true?  Yes, I have a dog, the Mr. Maloonigan.  And what type of dog is Mr. Maloonigan?  He's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle, ladies and gentlemen.  The rumors are finally settled.  And he doesn't know where his clothes are from, huh?  And, Bobo, so you have no idea where the clothes are from?  No.  They were just, they just were in his closet?  They just miraculously appeared in your closet? 
[00:41:30]  No, they were bought, but I forgot where they were from.  Who made them?  I forgot.  Do you remember where you purchased the clothes from?  I don't know.  I purchased them at a Macy's.  Macy's!  A Macy's client.  Bobo, highlighting Macy's with the, and are those, what type of shoes are those?  These are just some shoes.  Just some shoes.  Just some shoes and a suit for Macy's and the bowling shirt.  He had a truck.  All right, well, thank you for stopping by.  Of course, everybody's trying to get a little time with Bobo. 
[00:42:00]  You can keep walking.  Oh, my God.  Everybody's trying to get a little time with Daniel Bobo Curlin.  We're lucky to get a few minutes as the red carpet continues.  And, oh, Big A!  Oh, wow.  Big A, a lot of celebrities.  Sharp dress.  He is dressed to the nine.  He's dressed for six feet under.  Incredible Big A in a full suit.  No bowling shirt.  Actually, a dress shirt.  A tie.  You look great today, Big A.  Who are you wearing?  Casual male. 
[00:42:30]  Casual male.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  And that's what Big A is, isn't it?  A casual male.  Yes.  So what have you been doing with your free time since we last saw you?  Nothing much, really.  Hanging out with friends and nothing much.  Well, if there's one thing we know about Big A, he does tend to hang out.  Is that right?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  What talent are you working on for today's big talent super show?  Comedy. 
[00:43:00]  Comedy.  All right.  Now, do you have any joke that you could kind of pull off the top of your head for the people  at home just watching the red carpet coverage?  Not really, no.  No.  Not really, no.  No is the answer.  He doesn't know one joke.  You don't know a single joke?  I'll stop my head.  I can't really think of the one now.  Not just one.  Who whips their lips and stick them to the wall. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  And stu...  And stu...  And stu...  And stu...  Is there anything you're nervous about today specifically?  Um, I guess just tell jokes.  He's one of the great comedians.  Oh, wow.  And Colin Quinn.  And Colin Quinn will be here later.  I hope so.  Yes.  He's a celebrity.  Everybody wonders with celebrities like you.  Behind the scenes, do you hang out with any of the other celebrities? 
[00:44:00]  Are you friends with them?  Uh, yeah.  Patty.  Oh, and is it friends or is there a connection that we're getting a scoop on?  Just, uh, friends.  The question is, have you ever stuck it in?  Oh, no, no.  No, no, no.  Can you state that for the record?  Oh, yes.  Never, never.  Ask if he's ever eaten her ass.  Have you...  Say that again, uh, Big A?  I never...  I was...  I was...  I was... 
[00:44:30]  I was...  I was...  I was...  Oh, wow.  Was there a fuck in there?  I think he was upset with himself there.  Right.  Some of the other people on the red carpet are wondering if you've eaten, uh, Starker Patty's  ass before.  No, I have not.  Patty's waving it off.  What about one in the pink, one in the stink?  Oh.  Patty's ass, no.  Have you ever done, uh, one in the pink and one in the stink?  Some people do two in the pink.  How about one in the pink and five in the stink?  One in the pink, one in the stink? 
[00:45:00]  No.  One in the pink, five in the stink?  Nope.  No.  Never before.  Well, Big A, he certainly is maintaining his cool here on the red carpet.  He sure is, Sam.  He sure is.  All right.  Well, thank you, Big A.  Everybody's looking to talk to Big A.  Oh, yeah.  As he walks through.  We have more people?  We have one more.  Oh, my God.  Ending out the red carpet.  Oh, Mike Pichetti is here.  Oh, there's Mike Pichetti.  High five, Mike Pichetti.  And, uh.  Zero effort.  Yuppie fucked up collection.  In fact, guys are rusty. 
[00:45:30]  His pants suck.  I'm not a khaki guy.  I like the tap dance shoes you guys got me, though.  I'm ready to rock.  Who are you?  Wait, we got him shoes?  He's wearing his, yeah, his new tap dance shoes.  Oh, all right.  Okay, that's his talent?  Yeah, you will be performing tap.  Uh, today.  Are you excited about that?  But there's only a carpeting.  No, we have a tap dance surface for him, as well.  Oh, okay.  What is he wearing officially?  Oh, it's Patty.  Yeah.  We're a landmine.  Yeah.  The reporters want to know officially, who are you wearing? 
[00:46:00]  Uh, fat guys are us.  These pants suck.  This is, I look like a Vika.  Somebody gave me this.  He has a Throwdown Jones t-shirt on.  Throwdown Jones.  I think, uh, somewhere in South.  He's pointing, he's turning around to look at us.  His fingers are all up.  His fingers are all...  He's already pushed his glasses up 12 times.  Hold on.  Ask him who he's wearing again.  One question is, who are you wearing?  Uh, I hate this, I'm like, midtown yuppie fucking touristy fucking bullshit.  Where are the pants from? 
[00:46:30]  Uh, I think I went to, uh, exo male, like Andrew, fat guys are, uh, for me.  I think that's where I went.  I forgot.  Oh, boy.  You're the worst.  You're not, but lost some weight.  You did.  You look great.  I mean, you look fabulous.  Everybody's talking about it.  Four pounds, but in that fucking ass, I can't take it anymore.  Well, congratulations.  Is there anybody that you've been excited about seeing?  It's kind of a who's who around the red carpet tonight.  I'm excited about seeing everybody here.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I can't wait to go inside.  I love you guys.  Go inside.  That's amazing. 
[00:47:00]  Out of the red carpet, yes.  Yeah, I do know you got, you got here a little stylishly late, though, rounding out the red carpet.  Sam, I fucked up.  I remember the red carpet.  I'm like, Jesus, I don't have anything.  This is, this isn't even a carpet.  Look at this.  How would you describe your look?  Uh, casual, but fun, I think.  I don't know.  Hey, where did you, those pants are casual, but fun.  Where did you get the pants?  Oh, uh, exo male.  Form, formally exo male.  I hope it's going to be like, Sam, I hope you get down your weight.  I don't know if that'll happen, but I mean, right. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, Mike, you got to watch out for you.  No, no, I want to get some flaws, man.  I've been, I've been, now the question on everybody's mind is, what are you pointing at?  Uh, I don't know.  My hands just move around a lot.  It's just, it's kind of a spasm, I think.  Yeah, they do.  Any attractive females that you've seen here today?  Uh, coming into the city, oh yeah, there's hoes up this early in the morning, all getting  dressed up, going to work.  It's like, all the secondary types, yeah, baby, they're hot.  Uh, some skankers sitting next to me on the bus, and I'm like, oh yeah, it's early, though. 
[00:48:00]  You are the reason why women feel threatened on the bus.  It's never early to get some, some snatch.  It's always time for, you know.  Well, I mean.  This is a red carpet interview?  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  The Seacrest follow-up question would be, of course, have you gotten any snatch this morning?  I've been on Tinder a lot.  I almost came close to get, I always come close to a woman, Sam.  I'm like a good real estate guy.  I come close, and I can't see all the day.  He's on Tinder?  Now you don't know what he's on.  How much success have you had on Tinder?  Uh, some girl was like, are you weird?  I'm like, no, you fucking skank. 
[00:48:30]  I'm getting off here.  But what if she was trying to seduce you?  No, she was asking, I forgot what she was asking, but she's saying, I don't trust that.  I was going to get on another site where you pick up, oh God.  I'm very paranoid, too.  Like, I don't want to have some guy fucking kick my head in the middle of the night fucking  somebody's woman.  Right, right, right, right.  Well, I want to see his Tinder photo.  That should be 8,003 for him.  You have to be careful.  I mean, here on the red carpet, we're all careful.  This is, as we know, a red carpet interview. 
[00:49:00]  Everybody looking to talk to you, Mike Bassetti.  I don't want to hog up your time, so keep walking.  And the coverage of the Super Show continues here on the Open Anthony channel.  Guys, I'll throw it to you in there.  Thank you, Sam.  Sounds like an amazing red carpet.  Wow.  That is just started.  Yeah, studded out there.  Look at the flashes going off from the paparazzi's cameras.  You can feel the excitement in the air.  You can.  It's everywhere today.  Mike Bassetti fixing his glasses over and over again, just keeps pushing them up. 
[00:49:30]  Then they fall down and he pushes them up again.  His hand's trying to get into his pocket.  He's got, like, short arms or something.  He does have very T-Rex-ish arms.  All right, let's go back to Dennis Falcone.  Well, Colin's on his way.  Colin's on his way.  I saw Twitter.  He said he's on his way.  All right.  As soon as Colin arrives, we will get the festivities going.  Sam, Sam, can we ask you to remain vigilant for when Colin comes so you can interview him for the red carpet?  Oh, absolutely.  Red carpet coverage will continue.  Oh, great.  Thank God, yes.  Yes, Dennis. 
[00:50:00]  Hey, let's hear it for Sam Roberts.  Oh, yeah.  Doing a great job out there, Sam.  The radio man.  Sam, Sam, the radio man.  Hopefully everybody is happy today.  I know I am.  Oh.  Here on the Opie and Anthony Extravaganza Super Show 3, baby.  It might seem crazy what I'm about to say.  Sunshine, she's here.  You can take a break.  I'm a hot air balloon.  Just letting the music kind of breathe and speak to yourself. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  We didn't have to say anything.  Well, you're kind of looking at me like...  What, were you getting nervous that no one was talking?  Yeah.  We were just letting the music, you know...  Breathe.  Kind of breathe.  Now all the celebrities are just mingling out there.  Oh, yeah.  There's a group shot going on.  This is amazing.  Sam, what's going on with the group shot, I see?  Yeah, they should do a group selfie like they did on the Oscars.  Oh, yeah.  And just have it all red.  That's a great idea. 
[00:51:00]  Get it out there.  Get it out there.  This is like the Ocean's Eleven of buffoons.  Every star all together in one place.  Amazing.  IQ 11s.  And ocean dwellers.  Yeah, get them all together and tweak that out with a hashtag.  I'm going to have them use my phone so I own the picture.  Right.  And then hashtag super show.  Opie, it'll be amazing.  Don't do that just yet. 
[00:51:30]  Opie's coming out here with his phone, Patty.  There they go.  Not just yet, Patty.  Look at Getty Images is out there.  I'm going to take a picture, too.  Yeah, you take a picture, Ant.  Everybody talk, I guess.  I'll talk.  Sam will talk.  They're all taking a selfie.  This could be as big as the Oscar selfie that Ellen took.  Everybody together, Patty and Di and Mike Baccetti.  I don't see this one taking off quite as well.  You don't think it'll be as good?  No, I don't see this one with the... 
[00:52:00]  We are going to have a hashtag attached to it.  Yeah, that's true.  Wait a minute.  Jim, I don't mean to alarm you, but just in time for the selfie, Colin Quinn has arrived.  Perfect.  Colin Quinn is here.  Let's get Colin in the selfie.  Colin, please.  Let's get in the selfie.  I mean, Colin, legendary on Twitter.  Yes.  I mean, Di might have the ugliest smile I've ever seen on a human being.  That's Lady Di.  All right, we got the...  It's just like the Oscars selfie. 
[00:52:30]  Colin!  Mr. Quinn!  Mr. Quinn has arrived.  Mr. Quinn!  Mr. Quinn, a moment!  A moment, Mr. Quinn!  He's getting tight hugs from Lady Di.  By the way, a little tidbit.  Lady Di was promised $100 to come on the show today,  but informed me that if it was from Colin,  she didn't need the $100.  A date would suffice.  Wow.  Yes.  Whoa, is there love in the air?  There is.  She's resting...  Or is that someone's breath out there? 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  Is there any smells?  A little bit.  Resting her head on Colin's shoulder.  Colin came dressed, by the way.  Beautiful shirt, a nice blazer.  Oh, nice.  Red carpet appropriate.  I do like Bobo's mobster shirt.  Yeah.  Bobo's wearing, like, a Tony Soprano kind of bowling shirt.  Colin Quinn is here.  Colin, are you excited as we all are for the Super Show?  Well, yes, I really am.  This should be a big event.  It's big every year.  Heidi came in from SINY. 
[00:53:30]  And so did Pichetti, I guess.  Yeah.  Di is outside the city.  The effort it takes to get in here from St. Island.  Lady Di is still gripping your shoulder.  That's fantastic.  She looks lovely.  I love him.  She looks lovely.  Now, what you may not know, Colin, if you hadn't been watching our red carpet coverage earlier,  is that Lady Di has already clogged up the Starbucks toilet this morning.  You've already clogged the Starbucks toilet?  Stop.  Stop with that.  Get out of the way before you hit the, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  We don't want those old-me-beddies happening again. 
[00:54:00]  No, I know you didn't clog it up.  Of course not.  There's three solid logs we found out.  It's lovely.  She's going with a kind of a Rip Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor thing.  And what you can see...  Rip Taylor.  It's going to be violent on the red carpet.  If you like skin, you can see a little stomach down.  That's the way.  Keep him guessing.  Her stomach is busting out of her buttons.  I said, look.  Colin, who are you wearing?  Um, I think this is a Banana Republic.  I could be...  And Mike, Mike Trichetti.  Where did you get your pants from? 
[00:54:30]  A casual fat guy.  I think a fat fuck...  Oh, again.  Again.  A joke at work.  Midtown yuppie.  A blessed five times.  Cacky shit.  Right.  Well, uh...  Colin, everybody's headed inside.  You're ready to head in.  Yes, I am ready.  All right.  Next to him.  Hold on, Dye.  Everybody's not quite ready for you.  Yeah, not yet.  Not yet.  It'll just be Colin going in on the stage. 
[00:55:00]  Hey, there he is.  Colin Quinn.  You look fantastic, Colin.  Oh, my God.  You look great, Colin.  He's got a jacket on, a nice shirt.  You're looking good.  A little problem with Sandy Kane.  He's caught downstairs with no ID right now.  Oh, is that what happened?  Sandy Kane...  Look, a little behind-the-scenes gossip.  Can he go down and get her up or no?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Quite a scene already.  She's making a scene.  Hey, man.  I don't have my fucking ID, man.  I don't have an ID.  I don't need to show you, man. 
[00:55:30]  What is this?  Fucking communist Russia?  Hey.  It's fucking radio show, man.  Sam, what?  I believe there is some red carpet action going on out here.  We have another guest.  I see.  She's making her way down the hall.  Nobody was sure if she was going to make it to the celebration today.  Yeah.  Does she have an entourage, Sam?  It looks like she might have an entourage.  She may have an entourage.  If that's some kind of disease, then it's yes.  Yes. 
[00:56:00]  An entourage of bedbugs and fleas.  If we remember the last Super Show, she was a no-show.  Yes.  Nobody quite sure of her whereabouts, but I think she regrets that in hindsight.  And that's why she showed up to this one.  If you were listening to the last Super Show, I'm sure she was probably like,  I should have been there.  This is so exciting.  And if you could see what I'm seeing, there is a vision walking down the hall.  Hubba, hubba.  She's wiggling her tits as she walks.  Oh, yes.  Sandy Kane headed to the red carpet making her long-awaited return. 
[00:56:30]  I'm going to guess who she's wearing.  Dr. Frankenstein.  That is horrible.  Sandy Kane.  The guys are already inside commenting on how sexy you look.  Hang on a second.  Hang on, Sandy.  She's trying to come right in.  Sandy.  Over here a little bit so the guys can see you through the window.  We're doing some red carpet interviews.  How are you this morning, Sandy?  Hey, man.  I'm here.  I showed.  You did show indeed.  Who are you wearing?  Who am I wearing?  That's exactly right.  Who am I wearing? 
[00:57:00]  What do you mean, who am I wearing?  American doll place.  How are you?  Hello.  Can you say fuck?  Hey, can you say fuck?  Yes.  All right.  Good.  Fredericks of Douglas.  That's my lovely show.  Where did you get your outfit from, I think is the question.  Hollywood.  Hollywood.  Hollywood Boulevard has the best strip clothes.  Is that in Los Angeles?  Yes.  L.A.  Oh.  Yes.  Where they need the rainwater.  The best strip clothes.  Thanks for inviting me to the red carpet.  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, it's a big super show. 
[00:57:30]  The red carpet extravagance is a part of it.  Lady Di was talking to us earlier about how she's clawed the toilet.  Oh, my hat just fell off.  Don't lose your hat, Sandy.  Unfortunately, my head wasn't in it.  A red bush matches the red carpet.  Your red bush?  Funny you should mention it.  Host of Opie and Anthony, Anthony Cumia, has just been talking about wanting to see a big red bush.  It's the last, like, stand-up warehouse outside of Lake Guadalajara.  I mean, and maybe that's something...  It's only two-year-old's like a Tuesday afternoon.  Maybe that's something to look forward to later. 
[00:58:00]  Maybe Anthony gets to see that big red bush?  Yeah, I don't think so.  Do you think Dougie Douglas would be proud to sponsor this one?  It's not that red.  It's not that red.  It's not that red.  No, I don't think it's red at all.  Sam, ask about the controversy about the arrest in Times Square.  Now, Sandy, you've been making a lot of gossip columns lately.  There's some controversy that surrounded you about the NYPD in an arrest?  Oh, right.  I wanted to bring the article with me.  I have a new lawyer, so I was there yesterday, signed on with a lawyer. 
[00:58:30]  And because, you know, it's really unfair for them.  Well, what happened?  What happened was I was playing my guitar singing on 45th Street and 7th Avenue.  And this police car just pulls up and says,  You're under arrest.  Unattended package.  I said, Officer, it's my guitar case.  I play guitar and I sing.  I'm the naked cowgirl.  He said, That's just too bad.  He said, You're under unattended package.  Did you get to see his unattended package?  Yeah.  So he pulled his dick out. 
[00:59:00]  No, he didn't.  No, he was a sergeant.  Should I mention his name?  No, I kid.  Dietrich.  Dietrich.  So anyway, they walked me over.  Was the problem that he was gay?  No, he wasn't gay, honey.  He was a bully.  He was called a fucking bully.  What song was she singing?  Two days later, after I got...  The question on everybody's mind,  what song were you singing at the time of the arrest?  You ain't nothing but a hound dog crying all the time.  I thought you were singing into a mirror.  No genital pun into that song? 
[00:59:30]  You're not going to fuck my hairy pussy and that's no crime of mine.  I love the standards.  You ain't nothing but a hound dog.  Unpredictable on the red carpet here.  Yes.  Ask her what she wants from New York City.  The question is, what is it that you want from New York City?  Love.  Oh, very good.  After the arrest.  After the arrest.  Following the arrest.  Yes.  What do you want from the people and the law enforcement of New York City?  Well, you know, now that I signed on with this lawyer, I want at least a million dollars 
[01:00:00]  because, Sam, you know, at the beginning, it was just me and the naked cowboy.  Now there's a million people out there, these illegal immigrants under these Disney costumes.  Oh, controversy.  And they're arrested.  A little political statement.  Oh, motherfucker.  I was there.  Yeah, you were the first to steal this idea.  Yeah, exactly.  Are we going to expect an apology from her?  Say her.  Anyway.  Are you the first to steal this idea?  Say her.  Now, when you were arrested, were the tits concealed? 
[01:00:30]  No, the tits were fucking out, bitch.  And that's why they arrested me.  They can't arrest you for being topless, so they're arresting you for unattended package.  There is no law unattended.  So the complaint says, the complaint says, disorderly calm.  They arrested her for unattractive package.  Disorderly calm.  So it's me and Alec fucking Baldwin, right?  He's driving a fucking bike.  They arrest him.  What the fuck?  She's name-dropping now, too, on the red card, but I like that. 
[01:01:00]  Celebrities bring brother Alec Baldwin.  Is there a war in New York City against celebrities?  No, I think they have a quota to make, also.  They say there's a quota at the end of the month.  They've got to make money, so instead of protecting citizens, they're going to have their salary.  All right, she's battling, Sam.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Move right along to the red card, man.  And the photographers want to talk to you later.  We'll get you excited in just a few moments.  It's like a strip club.  All right, thanks, Sandy Kane. 
[01:01:30]  We'll just keep moving where the photographers are.  Everybody wants a moment with Sandy Kane.  It's just electric out here.  Thank you, Sam.  Unfortunately, I wish it was like a toaster in a bathtub electric.  Colin, you like our setup today?  Pretty impressive, huh?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I walked in, yeah, you can feel it.  A red carpet.  You got the cameras going off.  You got the Dunkin' Donuts.  Beautiful.  And they all have a talent today that they're going to be performing.  I heard.  Yeah.  It's kind of great.  Bobo's doing magic.  Wow.  Big A's doing stand-up. 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  Lady Di's doing a belly dance.  Oh, yeah.  She already has a little bit of her belly exposed.  Oh, did you see that?  The buttons were pulling apart.  Yeah.  There was a lot of strain on those buttons.  I think she was embarrassed for you to be told that she took such a hefty dump that it  clogged the toilet at Starbucks.  I don't even want to discuss that in front of you.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, you know, it's one of those things.  But, I mean, three large ones.  To clog a toilet at a commercial establishment.  Starbucks.  That's pretty impressive.  You should flush a truck tire down that toilet. 
[01:02:30]  That's what I do.  Yes, truck tires.  But she denies that she clogged it.  She thinks it's one of those New York myths.  Oh, maybe it's not her fault.  Yeah.  Well, I think we're ready to get going.  So, Dennis, why don't you pump it up one time here, get us to the break.  And when we return, I guess we're going to start some of the talent show.  Great.  Well, I think the only word that could describe what we all just experienced is pure magic. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, that's one word.  Pure radio magic here on the O.B. and Anthony Super Show, Volume 3.  Let's go back to 1975.  Hit music from Pilot.  Whoa.  It's magic.  You know.  You guys are a weird game today.  It's a very professional atmosphere.  Everything's moving.  Nice.  Shut up.  It's not so.  It's magic.  You know.  Never been.  Here's how's DJ, Tinkle Lord, Dennis Falco. 
[01:03:30]  I tell you, the excitement is just building.  I don't know how we're going to keep it all contained in one studio, but you know what?  We will try.  Thank God it's right, everybody.  Get you in shape.  And it's set for the weekend.  Let's go.  Let's party.  Did they call him Tinkle Lord?  What?  You didn't hear that?  No.  In the intro?  No.  They said, and now here's Tinkle Lord.  You're Tinkle Lord.  Oh, Denny Falco.  You don't like that rumor, do you, Dennis? 
[01:04:00]  Not at all.  Not at all.  You could make fun of me on anything else that you'd like.  Yeah.  Well, I guess you can tell the listeners not to worry about it.  You'll be all right.  Yeah.  Oh, the self-sucking thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He used to suck his own cock.  No, no, no, no.  Why would you be ashamed of that?  That's good.  Yeah, it is good.  We can tell him that.  And now he's the Tinkle Lord as well.  He takes, you know, urine on his chest, like someone else we know.  He's embarrassed about these things about him that have come out.  Dennis, the world is filled with all kinds of drama, and it would explode him. 
[01:04:30]  There's nuclear war.  Who gives a day about your little proclivities?  I miss that.  Right.  I miss that nuclear war part.  He's looking down at his song list.  He doesn't want any part of this.  No, no, no.  Colin, we're about to get the festivities going.  Yeah, come ready.  We're going to bring Oscar in first, because he's very pissed off that he has to hang out in  the office with what he said, the retards.  Yes.  Because he's a normal guy.  He just gets very nervous.  I know, but, you know, if he's a normal guy, you should know the word retard is really  proud of him in today's society.  Yes. 
[01:05:00]  All right, let's bring him in, Sam.  Let's go.  Oscar, what's going on in the office?  I hear you're not happy that you've got to hang out with the rest of the people.  Oh, no, it's just sweaty.  A lot of people in there.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  It's sweaty and a lot of people, huh?  Yeah, it's just cram in there.  Hey, what's up, Colin?  How you doing?  How's it going, Oscar?  Oh, loving it, man.  Everything's good, man.  How you doing?  Good, good, good.  Awesome.  You look good, man.  You look really good.  Thanks.  Awesome.  You too.  Oh, thank you.  Look at how sweaty he is. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was in that room.  Yeah.  Hell, yeah.  Yeah.  What's up?  We heard you were very disgruntled.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, I didn't really get enough sleep last night.  It was quite a late night.  So, yeah.  How late was it?  About two in the morning, and I just woke up at like fucking four, you know, get on the  early train.  I thought it was a joke set up.  Yeah.  She's two hours sleep.  Where do you live?  Oh, in Jersey, Morristown.  Oh, my God.  Oh, an hour train ride.  God, it's so loud.  Isn't he loud?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Let's keep it quiet.  He's the best.  I love this kid.  He's my favorite, Colin.  We all have our favorites.  Yeah.  Oscar's mine, by far.  Yeah.  And he's not on the show a lot, unfortunately.  He sounds like WCW.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Where did he come from?  Again.  I think he interned for us.  Oh, you were an intern?  Yeah, 2010.  Summer 2010.  Wow.  That long ago.  That long ago.  Wow.  Almost four years ago.  What happens to the time, right?  We wasted it.  We really do waste it.  Yeah, so a giant waste of time like now. 
[01:06:30]  Did you party last night?  No, I have about six beers.  That's it.  What about?  Oh, no, no.  I have to hold off.  I just do this stuff on the weekend.  What?  What on the weekend?  Oh, just do chill out, relax.  What do you do on the weekend?  I listen to reggae music and just mellow out.  Reggae?  Yeah.  I'm into reggae now.  Love it.  It's a nice change because I love metal.  Isn't it monotonous, though?  Ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, well, no, I've discovered a couple bands from California.  Really nice.  Bunch of white guys that do reggae. 
[01:07:00]  Sublime, maybe.  Oh, yeah, pretty good.  Yeah, like Iration and Stick Figure.  You don't like black people, then?  Oh, no, I love black people.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  That's what I heard.  Yeah, oh, no.  You probably don't want to announce it on the radio.  Oh, no, I don't mean it that way.  You'd rather have white reggae guys.  No, no, I just, the variation, you know.  What are the names of the bands?  Oh, Iration, let's see, Stick Figure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stick Figure, huh?  Yeah, good stuff, man. 
[01:07:30]  It's good stuff.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, expandables.  Yeah, good stuff.  Hell, yeah.  A little of the ganja, huh?  Oh, whoa, whoa.  You know, you don't have to say anything.  It's good, though.  I'm telling you something, man.  Yeah, go ahead.  Tell us.  I'm going to lean in for this one.  It's like you can expand, man.  And I get a lot of great ideas.  And so far, the last four months, I know I've been on a productive, just, I mean, rollercoaster,  man.  It's just, I've been just running around, getting shit done.  We're still recording our album with the band. 
[01:08:00]  Wait, you've been productive because of this?  Yeah, I think so.  What kind of ideas have you gotten off the ganja?  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do a cookbook.  Yeah.  A cookbook?  Yeah, and the title's going to be Stoners.  Ah, that's pretty good.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, I've been in.  What's in the cookbook?  It's all sort of different flavors that, you know, it appeals to.  How about to serve man? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  That's a good name for a cookbook.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Oh, actually, I'm in the process of getting a Texas-style brisket little smoker.  Hell yeah, I was trying to get it.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, hell yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm here to do the Texas brisket.  Yeah.  It's cool.  It's watching recipes on YouTube.  It'll be fun, man.  Watching recipes on YouTube.  Yeah.  Brisket recipes on YouTube.  Yeah, no, it's cool.  People put some good videos up there.  Yeah, they do.  I've been watching a couple of them.  Yeah.  But what was the moment today when you were in that office where you just, all of this enthusiasm 
[01:09:00]  just dropped away and you just said, I want to kill myself.  What was the moment in the office?  Like, who was next to you?  Just, you know, in the last two hours, it just made you feel like, what am I doing in this  place?  Yeah, we won't tell them.  Who do you have a problem with?  Yeah.  It's got to be someone.  That's a great question.  Is there, like, any interaction or is there somebody just brushed against you or do you  listen to a certain conversation, you realize life is really horrible and pitiless and  like, kind of, like, miserable?  Yeah.  Mike, he's a really, really sweet guy. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, he's a doll.  He's just a little sweaty.  So, no, when the picture, the group picture, he's put his hand around me.  I'm like, oh, man.  He smells, right?  Like locker room, man.  He smells like a locker room?  No, no, no.  I mean, I don't want to be, I don't want to show anybody.  And he's the one that's closest to Morristown.  He's in Staten Island.  I can hear you.  Oh, yeah.  No, but I love Mike.  Mike, Mike, don't take this the wrong way, man.  No.  How could he?  But he smells, right?  And he's sweating.  Oh, no, with excitement.  I'm sweating myself.  But I mean, not so, you know.  Mike sweats at anticipation.  Let's bring Mike in so we can tell him, so we can tell him what Oscar thinks of him. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, no.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Oscar doesn't like you.  He just told us.  No.  Why wouldn't you like Mike Bechette?  He's a great guy.  Yeah, why wouldn't you like him?  I keep talking in the thin air, Mike.  Hold on.  I'm used to being, like, you know.  Oscar's cool.  I just met him today.  I'm good.  I don't care.  This is two nervous guys.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Nervous.  I can't help.  I mean, you know, it's who I am. 
[01:10:30]  Two nervous brutes with hand fists.  Giant forearms looking at each other.  We've got to call Vince McMahon.  This would be a great tag team right here.  Mike, your fingernails are a weird color.  Oh, the ground is like reddish.  I can't see his fingernails.  They're reddish.  Are they reddish?  No, they're, yeah, they might be.  Let me see.  Why are they reddish?  I'm from being inside or off.  I'm a vampire.  I stay at blade.  I go to, you know what I mean?  I'm not a morning guy.  These weird pink fingernails.  I don't know.  I don't know, I just, you know, go to bed like 6 a.m. and get up at like early afternoon. 
[01:11:00]  Oscar says you might be a bit sweaty.  And you might, and you might, you know, you might reek a little bit.  It looks like you lost weight.  Yeah, it was 44 pounds.  Congratulations.  Yeah, a few months.  I'm huge.  A Nutrisystem.  But I just stopped it now and started eating regular shit.  Yeah.  I couldn't take that afternoon food out.  It's fucking hard.  Is it?  The Nutrisystem food? 
[01:11:30]  The first few weeks are brutal.  I was buying that.  I couldn't shit.  Oh, fuck.  It was fucking hard.  Good story.  Yeah, very good story.  All right.  But the first time I had it, you know, it was like a muffin.  Day one.  Uh-huh.  I mean, you know a muffin.  You know a muffin.  This thing was the size of my thumbnail.  It sucked.  I was having food withdrawals for the first few days.  Oh, well, that's probably a little better.  You've got to suffer a little bit.  Yeah, well, bet.  It's not that easy.  No, it sucks, though.  But, you know.  Oscar, what would you suggest for Mike Prescetti? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, bro.  So maybe to calm down the sweat and maybe the odor.  Oh, man.  Dude, if you drink a lot of water, man.  Oh, yeah.  Drink lots of water.  I am.  I drink a lot of ice.  Yeah, absolutely.  A lot of iced coffee.  I've been jonesing on that lately.  Yeah, that's your thing.  Why do I feel like I'm in a conversation in a warehouse right now?  I feel like I'm in a loading dock.  Oh, shit. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Should we bring in some more people?  I would think so.  Sure, sure.  Oscar, you're going to be doing some freestyling today.  Oh, I'm going to try, man.  Are you writing some things?  Yeah, white reindeer freestyle.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You should start writing something, maybe.  And Mike Buschetti is going to be doing some tap dancing, Colin.  Great.  Yeah.  I can't wait, Mike.  He's wearing tap shoes right now, but you can't hear it because, you know, it's on car.  I love him.  I feel like I'm in the 40s, guys.  The picture was awesome.  I feel like it was great.  Fuck one of the Andrews sisters. 
[01:13:00]  He's like Donald O'Connor.  What do you have against the Andrews sisters?  No, I love them.  It's a fart, Anthony.  I loved ones from those days.  They were all like those bullet bras.  Oh, they had a certain style, a class.  Yeah.  I think they would have did good in the 40s.  I was like that.  Yeah, they had nice stems.  Yeah.  Right?  Nice game.  Nice game.  It's fun if you're rotten tomatoes where the whores are, really.  I'm shorter around then.  Why is every woman a whore to you?  It might be the problem as far as getting laid. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck your game.  Right, all right, we're bringing in the next super show participant to join the crowd.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez, you can't even open the door.  Wow, we are actually, look at that belly.  Your belly is popping up in your dress.  Oh, my God.  Woo.  What's that?  That's a style.  That's a deliberate style.  Yeah.  Her fucking buttons, you know what that looks like?  It looks like the fucking cables at the T-Rex paddock. 
[01:14:00]  Wow.  Oscar, what do you think of Lady Di?  Denny is really, really hitting the music today.  I love it.  I hope you're paying attention to the music.  Great job, Denny Falcone.  You might know Baby Elephant Walk.  Oscar was just telling us that he finds you a bit attractive, Lady Di.  Wow.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Could we have a little connection?  That's nice.  Turn around and show them what you got. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  I find you attractive, too.  Oh, thank you.  Would you like to give her a kiss?  You could exchange bodily fluids like sweat.  Why are you flirting in front of Colin?  You called your guy and you flirted him.  You are a cock tease.  I love Colin.  You know it, Colin.  I know, honey.  Yeah, there you go.  Have you guys kissed, Jeff?  One day we're going to go out, right?  One day we're going to go at it.  Want to go at it?  Oh, I mean out.  Oh, yeah, that's better.  Okay.  Why?  You don't want to go at it with him?  Sure, sure I would. 
[01:15:00]  But you've got to go out first, don't you?  Yes, a little ritual.  All right.  Would you let Colin lick your box?  Good point.  She's grinning.  She's coyly grinning.  I didn't think she was grinning at all.  I think she was just kind of upbraiding Jim like him.  Well, I don't want to.  Let's keep it peeping.  Oh, what is that?  Yeah, I would.  Yeah, I would.  I would.  I said it correctly.  I couldn't think of an answer to that.  No.  Would you want to be on your back while he did it,  or would you want him to be on his back  and you kind of smothering him with it? 
[01:15:30]  I would rather be on his back.  How many foot pounds are those buttons torched to?  Holy shit.  They're ready to pop across the room.  That is really...  Someone's going to lose an eye today.  Right?  It is like rivets when the sub goes too deep.  You know, I knew I should have put on a different shirt.  Well, you know, you had time to prepare.  I mean, you and Colin discussed this, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah.  But it's good for belly dance. 
[01:16:00]  That's correct.  Yeah, you got the belly for your belly dance.  I'll give you a special belly dance, okay?  Wow.  All right?  Okay.  What about ass play with Colin Quinn?  Is that open?  That's great.  I don't like ass play.  You don't like your ass play with?  No.  No, I don't like that.  Really?  She's not into it.  Is it because she dropped a big dump before?  No, it's not her.  It's just a general.  It's like a dance troupe when she belly dances.  It could be Giselle Bundchen.  It doesn't matter.  Who's Giselle Bundchen?  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  Your polar opposite.  Yes.  Take opposite.  Yeah.  Yeah, take everything that's you and make it the opposite.  Right.  And that's Giselle Bundchen.  I disagree.  If she had the tail in the tanning salon, that stomach would look similar.  Yeah, yeah.  You just did a quick tanning salon session for that.  Hey, I noticed that.  I need to do sit-ups.  That's what I need to do.  You're right.  That's it.  And I don't do sit-ups.  Until 2045.  You need to do body-ups.  Uh-huh.  Body-ups.  No, not body-ups.  Just sit-ups.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:17:00]  What's going on with my mic today?  Yeah.  Hey, I see the tap dance floor has arrived.  So maybe Mike can show off a little of his tail real fast.  A little tap dance prowess?  Don't give him everything, though, Mike.  Just a little taste.  You forgot your floor.  Can I sit down?  Can I sit down?  We'll do some tap dancing.  Can you sit down?  What's the matter?  Do you have to?  Are you going to fucking...  No, this thing is itching me.  That ripped tail around.  Oh, oh.  It's the boa.  The boa is coming apart. 
[01:17:30]  Look, it's all over you.  Fucking roof buggy.  Oh, God.  No kidding.  All right, Mike.  You got to mic the floor.  Yeah, we got to...  Oh, wait, wait.  What?  All right, do a little...  Is that a sound check?  He does have skills.  He does have skills.  I got to get a fucking shot of this.  Jesus.  All right, go ahead, Mike.  I hate tap dancing.  Who likes it?  I love this.  I feel like I'm in the floor.  I wish I would have been born in 1911.  So do we, because you'd be...  No, no, no, no.  Mike's my friend. 
[01:18:00]  Go ahead, Mike.  Okay.  All right.  It was fun.  Thank you.  All right, just a little taste.  A little taste.  That's some good stuff right there.  That was good.  I'd always add a flamenco vibe to it.  Thank you.  That was fun, actually.  That's my longest time I exercised in the past 25 years.  Oh, boogie shoes. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, very nice, Dennis.  All right, who do we want in next?  Stalker Patty?  Colin, would you like to say hi to Stalker Patty?  Sure.  Okay.  I saw it on the carpet.  Huh?  I saw it on the carpet.  We had a brief conversation.  Patty's taking some issues with some of what Di's been doing in here.  Oh, okay, good.  Oh, she thinks you're a bit messy.  Wow.  Oh, I want the feathers, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that was all the talent we're going to get out of Bichetti, huh?  No, that was just a taste.  Oh, that was a little sound check.  He's saving the rest for later. 
[01:19:00]  It's a shame.  People tuned in.  Right.  I like it.  Bojangles, pardon me, for later.  It becomes Stalker Patty.  Oh, Patty's looking lovely today.  Oh, she always has an issue when we die.  She's lovely today.  Thank you.  What a sparkly dress you're wearing.  What's the matter?  What did I say?  Well, just tell her.  No, you have bathroom habits and things like that.  Well, he's the one that asked me these things.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about that.  It goes, you know, what I heard on the show.  What did you hear, Patty?  When you were on, you know, when you were interning, some of the things you did were not very cool. 
[01:19:30]  Like what, Patty?  What, Patty?  Like what?  Like what?  Oh, what, in the bathroom?  Yeah.  Going to the bathroom with the stall open?  But who's to know if that wasn't just ugly Betty's Hollywood diva behavior?  Patty.  You know, in the real world, sometimes people forget to lock the door.  It was so low, all right, and I had to hold on to the door.  No, Lady Di, you got completely naked in a public bathroom.  You're going to another stall that had to be closed.  In front of everyone.  After puking in the sink. 
[01:20:00]  She vomited in the sink, Patty.  Yeah, that's a health violation, Diana.  I'm sorry I did that.  I regret doing that.  I'm sorry.  You ever go into the bathroom at a Starbucks and see a big dump in the fucking toilet and  go, who the hell could have done this?  She clogged the toilet today on purpose.  When I worked in the city, we were a block from the Port Authority.  Oh, Colin, I didn't mean to have my bathroom.  That's why during block parties, we closed it.  Now I know where Starbucks got their lattes from.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is this thing on?  I'm afraid that's a little inaccurate on me. 
[01:20:30]  No, it is.  The microphone.  Very cute.  Yes, it's on.  So you really have a problem with Lady Di, her laziness, her...  Well, it's just the habits and things.  Her slobbish way.  You think she's slovenly.  Right.  You know what?  Those are slovenly habits, though.  Go in the sink, you know, and stuff like that.  She's not saying Lady Di you.  She's saying the habits and behavior.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  She's talking about the essence of Lady Di, of course.  Lady Di, she's basically calling you a pig. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  No, I didn't say that.  Lady Di, comment.  Comment, Lady Di.  Yes.  That will never happen again.  I realized that I was wrong, and that will never happen again.  Wow, right?  All the things you just mentioned, I'm not going to do that again.  Well, you know, you want to be thankful to Bill that he's so nice.  Wow.  He's not charging you rent.  He's not taking money from you.  He gives it to you sometimes.  Wow.  He's a very nice man.  Gives it to you sometimes, really?  Does he give it to you? 
[01:21:30]  You know what I mean?  I'm talking money.  Oh, I thought you meant a deep, deep dick-in.  All right.  Who's next?  Who's next?  Bobo?  All right.  How many we got left?  All right.  Bobo's still practicing his magic.  Oh.  Oh.  Excuse me a minute.  Big A.  But he does, he gives me money, and he puts a roof over my head, but he still does complain  about that.  Fascinating.  I know.  He complains about it.  You know, anybody would complain about that.  Thanks for filling in the windows.  Thank you.  Big A.  A top-y-arising comedian. 
[01:22:00]  There it is.  Big A looking very nice.  Is this going to be one of those Rupert Pupkin routines?  You're going to win Best Dressed today.  I'm from the Bronx.  Before it was a felony.  Right.  Big A, you're going to get to your hunkers.  You're going to win Best Dressed.  Big A looks like, yeah, he is.  He looks like he should be practicing a speech in the Godfather's Garden.  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  That's very good. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  So what do you think, Big A?  What's your thoughts so far?  What a mess this is.  Uh-huh.  What a wonderful, like what Alec Baldwin said, this is a mad carnival.  Yeah.  It's a mad house.  Who do you hate the most in this room?  Wow.  Who do I hate the most?  And you have to answer.  Is he going to do stand-up?  Lady Di.  Lady Di. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Most hated.  Why?  Most hated.  Congratulations.  It's a mess.  You don't like Lady Di?  Why are you clapping your hands?  Yeah, good point.  So why do you hate Lady Di?  Um, Jimmy, I don't see you happy every time she calls up.  Oh, no, I know why I hate her.  Oh, no, no, no.  Lady Di's dancing to the monkeys' songs.  We're too busy singing.  She likes the monkeys.  Pulled anybody down. 
[01:23:30]  You know what I was figuring it looks like?  It looks like you should be measuring someone in an Old West movie.  You're not trying to get restless.  Definitely.  A nice suit.  I like it.  Hey, hey, we're the monkeys.  People say we monkey around.  We're too busy singing.  Uh-huh.  To put anybody down.  Oh, she's wigging on her tits.  We just have to be friendly.  Jesus.  Come and watch us sing and play.  Yeah.  We're the young generation. 
[01:24:00]  And we've got something to say.  Oh, God.  That was a long ghost.  He didn't finish.  The lyric is supposed to be cirrhosis.  Any time or anywhere.  Yeah.  Just look over your shoulder.  I didn't know anybody who's new host, too.  Because you'll be standing there.  Wow.  Hey, hey, we're the monkeys.  Yeah, I know all the words.  Believe me.  We know.  We know.  Everyone knows the words to this song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is not an obscure song. 
[01:24:30]  But no one sings it.  Oh, God.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, hey, we're tuberculosis.  You know which song is very hard.  Fucking hacking cough.  You know which song is very hard to sing to with the monkeys?  What?  I'm going down.  I don't know that song.  A lot of people really don't know it.  All right?  I'm sure Dennis knows it.  She just takes her headphones off, right?  And then she gets off mic.  Why are your headphones off?  What are you doing?  And starts carrying on a conversation with Colin in the middle of the on-air show. 
[01:25:00]  In the middle of a broadcast.  I'm as shocked that you guys.  It's a very little moment.  Hold on, guy.  I'm shocked that the woman who vomits in the sink and shits at the stall door open doesn't  have proper radio technique.  I'm as outraged as I was.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Hey, bitch.  Who was singing in there?  It was like nauseous.  That's Lady Di.  Oh, man.  Who was it?  Di.  Hey, I was singing.  Di.  No wonder your name is Di. 
[01:25:30]  No, I'm just saying.  No, I'm just saying.  I hate to, you know.  You're going to take that shit, Lady Di?  You're going to take that shit?  It's okay.  It's all right.  I'm not going to say that.  I don't care.  No, I'm just saying.  It really sucked, man.  Well, how could you, like, really, you know, how could you be that low to sing?  And what was the name of that song?  Hey, we're the monkeys.  The monkeys.  The monkeys.  Hey, hey, we're the monkeys.  The monkeys.  Oh, you should sing I Love Dick.  What?  I Love Dick.  Oh, yeah.  A tribute to Nixon.  Anyway, I was married to a dick. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Who she voted for when she was 50 years old.  No, I'm just saying.  I went with a dick.  You did go with a dick.  I did.  His name, Dick Sean.  Remember him?  I remember Dick Sean.  I went with him.  You did?  You fucked Dick Sean?  Definitely.  Nice.  He used to snort Amy and my traits when he came.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  That's pleasant.  He died young.  That's what he died on stage.  Yeah, I know.  He predicted it, too.  Did you put on your makeup with a paintball gun?  That is really thick.  Oh, it is? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's very colorful.  Oh, thanks.  Well, you know, I wanted to be, you know.  But anyway, Dick is in the fucking house.  And wherever he is, man, he shouldn't have sorted those Amy and my traits.  He was wild in bed, huh?  Was he a good fuck?  Yeah.  I wanted to walk with a good paintball gun.  Not really.  Mike, hold on, hold on.  He was not a good fuck.  What's that, Steve?  He did not eat out.  Mike?  I love you on paintball gun.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, yeah, paintball.  It's fun, he says.  He, like, can satisfy himself.  But he was really a great man.  You have all bets on our side, Anthony.  Have all bets on our side, hiding in the bushes.  I was much younger than him, by the way. 
[01:27:00]  You really added a lot there.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  But he died on stage.  He even predicted.  He said, we're going to have something crazy happen.  Wow.  And he died.  And everyone thought it was like what he predicted.  And he was dead.  How many times did you bang him?  A lot.  A lot, huh?  Yeah.  Nice piece.  But he took email nitrate.  He was, he was, he was impotent.  He was really impotent.  But then he met me, and he loved me, because I got him hard.  Oh, wow.  He looked at me.  And then when I didn't get him hard anymore, he dumped me. 
[01:27:30]  Aw.  Why'd you stop getting him hard?  What happened?  Yeah, how'd you get him hard?  It sounds like a rom-com.  Well, he took, he took me, he was doing a show at Yale in Connecticut, and we went,  we stayed the weekends, and then he just dumped me.  This the 80s?  70s?  Yeah.  80s.  80s, huh?  Yeah.  A lot of coke?  A lot of marijuana.  He used to buy marijuana from me.  Oh, yeah?  You used to sell weed?  Not really.  Someone I knew did, and he put it from me, and then he gave back the weed and dumped me. 
[01:28:00]  It sucked.  He gave back the weed.  Yeah, he gave back the weed.  He said, I want my money back.  Wow.  I swear to God.  What was it?  Shitty shake?  I don't know, man.  I thought I pleased him, and then he gave back the marijuana, and then he gave it.  By the time you clean it out on your Yes album, there's nothing left.  Not really.  He dumped me.  I didn't even know, man.  I didn't even know.  You have a little fight in front of the Yale, some of the undergraduates watching.  No, no.  I thought he liked me, man, but I was very young and shit.  Low?  But anyway, Dick, we love you, man. 
[01:28:30]  Wherever you are, you have great comments.  That's true.  You love Dick?  Dick.  I love Dick.  No, Dick was the one that said, why don't you write funny songs?  Nice.  And then the I love Dick is like, I really feel, since it was the best song I ever wrote.  Can I see my pussy from here?  Ah, look.  She's standing on the floor, which is like a mirror.  Well, that's for the tap dancing.  This is my red bush, folks.  Wait, show Anthony your red bush.  Anthony has a red bush.  Come over here.  Anthony.  Come over here.  You can see her red bush. 
[01:29:00]  Come over here.  Let me see.  Hold on.  There's an upskirt photo being taken.  I like that you said, come over here.  Come over here.  Hey.  All right.  That's wonderful.  I can smell it myself.  Tuna fish in the house, folks.  Tuna in the house.  Clam chowder.  Oscar.  Yo.  What's going on over there?  It's good.  Just, uh, yeah.  Hanging out.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Did you just get sick? 
[01:29:30]  Tell me.  Did you just get sick from what you said?  No, no.  I'm sorry.  I just...  No, you can't smell me from there.  No, no.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm just near observation.  No, but I'm just...  What is this?  Yeah.  That's for the tap dancing.  You look under people's dresses up here.  Danny's doing a great job.  I knew it.  Yeah.  But are we going to hear he told me how to love, man?  And now I'm loving you.  You Jew.  You...  Dedicated to Dick Sean and every other guy that told me.  What are you talking about?  You got a song?  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Well, I'm thinking of releasing this song as a single.  And it's on my CD.  And a guy from Cherry Hill likes it.  And I really wanted to...  What song is it?  Which one?  It's called He Told Me How to Love and Now I'm Loving You.  I remember this song from Big.  Yeah.  This is when Tom Hanks was out in the sunroof of the limousine.  Wow.  This was recently recorded in Nashville, Tennessee.  Not this.  And...  With all those great musicians.  I like your wig today.  That's very nice.  That's my natural hair, man. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I have a wig down here.  Oh, jeez.  Where can people get your CD?  Oh, people...  Well, you can iTunes the song.  iTunes.  Thank you, Jim, in the fucking house.  Thanks, Jim.  It really isn't on sale.  Why don't we play a little bit of the song?  Because every store is closed.  So there's really...  Sandy Kane, everyone.  You're playing the song.  Okay.  You hear the whole thing?  No, I can't.  You can't hear it.  No.  Since I got back from Miami, things just ain't been the same. 
[01:31:00]  She puts the cunt in country, doesn't she?  I know I'm in the country.  I know how to play.  The mix could use a little help, huh?  Yeah.  It was a better mix on Dirk Diggler's song.  I love Dick.  I love Dick.  Who's this guy here?  He's cute.  Denny.  Denny.  What's your name, baby?  The Tinkle King. 
[01:31:30]  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Denny can suck his own cock.  Very cute.  He sucks his own cock.  He sucks his own dick.  That's not how we got to know.  No, no, no.  I thought we were not going there anymore.  Don't go there.  That's how we got to know him, though.  You didn't get to know me that way.  Sure.  You called up one day, said I could suck my dick.  We had you, and we had a nice little year, and you've been friends with us since.  It's been the history of since.  Have you sold any of those songs?  That song?  Oh, well, the promotion man, Larry Weir, from Harlan. 
[01:32:00]  There's better harmony between the Jews and Palestinians than on that record.  Well, there's a male voice.  Some people, the naked cowboy sued me over the male voice.  It's a long story.  The male voice?  There's a male voice on it.  There is.  Yes.  And so everyone can sing along.  It's for you to them.  You had a love and an identity.  Don was just molesting Colin in the corner.  She's molesting him.  She's molesting him.  Suck his dick.  Sandy, she's taking his dick.  Can you suck dick on radio?  Yes, you can. 
[01:32:30]  You're low.  Can you swallow cum, though?  You're trying to plug your CD, and she's...  She's taking your time off.  Yeah.  Okay, baby, suck his dick.  Do it, die.  I'm not here.  Make Bill jealous.  Not here.  Bill.  Yeah.  Did you ever talk to Bill?  Oh, we've talked to Bill.  What an asshole.  You don't like Bill?  Sandy, he's a fucking...  Oh, he's an asshole, man.  Yeah, but he likes you, though.  He likes me.  No, he's an asshole.  No, let's face it.  You're living with an asshole.  Okay.  Yeah? 
[01:33:00]  Besides the one in your twat, you know, behind your twat.  We don't have sex.  Oh, yes, you do.  No, we don't.  You have.  You have.  I have in the beginning, but only one time.  One time.  Stop.  So, did you swallow or what?  Your sense of view is like a Lay's potato chip.  No, I didn't swallow him.  Did he buck you in your ass or what?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Be honest.  Oh, well.  I am being honest.  What kind of sex did you have?  Just regular, standard, plain old sex. 
[01:33:30]  Missionary sex.  Ah, see, did you come?  Did he make you come?  Oh, my God.  Did he make you come?  Um, no.  Okay.  All right.  Nice.  Fucking Bill.  And now it's just you guys.  He'll laugh for himself, one-way motherfucker.  Yes, man.  Him and Dick Shawn.  No, no, no.  What are you guys talking about?  He used to.  He used to make me come.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  Wait, wait.  If it was one time, what do you mean used to make me come?  Well, it's...  You said...  Yeah, right. 
[01:34:00]  Mutual masturbation or something like that.  Mutual masturbation?  Mutual masturbation?  Something like that, yeah.  How are you doing over there?  Wow.  So there is a relationship here.  You're getting off.  You're tricking off over here.  I'm tricking off over here.  There is a relationship between you two.  I thought you said we don't...  What do you mean it's something like mutual masturbation?  What do you guys do?  How would he make you come?  Yeah.  Eat your pussy?  Come on.  Eat me there.  That's what he did, yeah.  All right.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  You wanted to know.  All right.  Okay.  But that was a long time ago, too.  Then, this is now.  It plunged him into alcoholism.  Bill should get the Purple Heart.  That was a long time ago.  Oh, my God.  I'm serious.  We don't even sleep together.  Oh, that's a sin or a shame or something.  Oscar, what do you think?  Man, he's probably blind.  A good one.  That's all right.  That works.  Well, what does he look like, though?  Oh, no.  He's a pretty good-looking guy. 
[01:35:00]  He's always screaming in the background.  She's always saying, hey, don't disregard Bill.  You don't like Bill, right?  Nah.  What would you do to Bill, Sandy?  What would I do to Bill?  If you had to be in that situation.  I'll send you a picture of him.  Give Lady Dye some advice.  Go ahead.  He's not really, you know, I'm really not into sex.  I'm more into sexy.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Although, Opie and Anthony, I would fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Baby.  But otherwise, we'll all. 
[01:35:30]  Fuck, yeah.  All right.  And Jim and Collin, too.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I just jot that down on my bucket list?  On the radio.  Fuck.  Okay.  But anyway.  I see Bill with a kind of a streetcar named Desire  standing on the wall.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  No.  He's not that good, though.  Stan, he was screaming.  I see him with a t-shirt and just kind of, you know, a bellicose kind of macho guy.  Beer in his hands.  Yeah.  Well, he has.  Beer and a cigarette.  Beer and cigarettes, yes.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Does he burn you with cigarettes?  No.  No.  We don't.  No, no, no.  He doesn't do that.  Bill's not a nice guy, though.  I picture him like the handyman from One Day at a Time.  What was his name?  He's a fucking asshole.  I picture him like a Schneider type of cigarettes rolled up in his t-shirt.  Hey there, Ms. Romero.  You know, coming upstairs to do a little fix to fix the stuff.  Hey there, Ms. O'Banny.  Ms. O'Banny.  I wish she was a Max Cady kind of guy.  He's a guy in all of the family.  The guy in all of the family.  What's his name?  You know.  Archie Bunker. 
[01:36:30]  Archie Bunker.  Archie Bunker.  Archie Bunker.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's more like that.  Yeah, yeah.  He's more like Archie.  He's more like that.  I think he hit it right there.  Is he racist?  Huh?  Does he say racist stuff around the house?  No, no.  He doesn't do that.  He doesn't like black stuff.  He's always screaming, though.  He's not a big fan.  He's not a nice guy at all.  No, not at all.  Why does he like blacks, Lady Di?  What?  He doesn't like blacks.  What's that about?  He didn't say...  No.  His best friend is a black guy.  Whoa.  That don't mean he don't like that he likes blacks.  Oh, well.  Does he bring him over and you have to service him? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  No.  He's the next door neighbor that came over that day.  Remember?  It's like the all in the family.  Did he tell you to lay down?  George Jefferson lives next door.  No.  But Bill screams all the time, this guy.  Yeah, he's always like, hello, you know, screaming.  What's wrong with him?  Yeah, who knows?  Ask her.  I don't know what's wrong with her.  With her.  No, but let's face it, you guys are real cool. 
[01:37:30]  And, you know, he's like a real dick.  He's a schmuck living in Jersey.  He says to me, you're welcome anytime in our house, San Diego.  I wouldn't even, you know.  He probably wants to fuck you, man.  Probably.  When did you talk to him?  Yeah, when did you talk to him?  I talked to him.  He says, hey, say hello to Bill, San Diego.  Yeah.  Wait, you guys have phone conversations?  He said hello to Bill, he likes you.  And I said, no, no, hi. 
[01:38:00]  Wait, wait, why are you calling her?  Or is she calling you?  Yeah, what is going on?  That's weird.  Why not?  Probably figure out you don't want the same outfit.  We don't just call each other.  I'm a jersey.  They don't wear the same outfit.  You saw it happen when Lucy and Ethel did that.  It's very embarrassing.  Jersey.  It's friendship.  Friendship.  Well, Marion's going to get...  I have to get your phone number.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, I've been telling Colin to get the number.  Why don't you guys just do it right now?  Exchange.  Okay.  I think Marion's going to get jealous of this friendship.  This new friendship between you two.  Why?  And where is Marion? 
[01:38:30]  Can we call her?  She's working.  If you want to try, you could try to...  Yeah, we got to call her.  She's very missed.  Get that tough guy on the phone.  Yeah, we need to talk to the tough guy.  Marion's a tough guy.  Yeah, hold on.  Colin, you got to tell her your number.  Yeah, Colin.  I need...  Go ahead, Colin.  Oh, my God.  How many calls a day?  There you go, Colin.  Hi, Colin.  I'm all fucking drunk.  Am I going to regret this, Lady Dunn?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, you're not going to regret this.  Go ahead.  She'll be fine.  Oh, jeez.  Give me your... 
[01:39:00]  Are you really going to give her your number?  Hey, Colin.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  I wouldn't...  Why?  Why?  Because, you know, you kind of are a piss.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  I mean, no, I'm just saying.  You don't know.  I'm not going to fucking test.  I'm not going to call him every day.  Calls me a hundred times.  Texts me.  Let's think about this.  Okay.  Sandy Cain has become the voice of my conscience.  Okay.  Come on.  All right.  Okay.  You want a fucking million calls and texts, give her your number, man. 
[01:39:30]  You don't want that.  Hey, you're a superstar, Colin.  You don't want that.  You are a superstar, Colin.  What are you doing?  What's wrong with her?  I'll give you my phone number.  She calls a million times and texts.  Is she a pest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a fucking pest.  When we go off the air, I'll give you my phone number.  All right.  Wow.  You guys should have changed.  It's only fair.  Whoa.  Dice.  Yeah.  Hello.  The voice of reality.  Wow.  Come on, Sandy.  You're not that bad, am I?  Yes.  Okay.  You said that he gave you his phone like me. 
[01:40:00]  You know, I don't even see what they see in you.  What the fuck?  We have all these people with credits?  Sandy is the fucking voice of reason here.  You know, I'm just saying that all of a sudden there's you, but, you know, I'm just saying  that, you know, you really don't face reality, Di, so.  What's the reality with her?  I mean, look, you have Colin, Jim, superstars, Sandy fucking Kane in the house, the naked cowgirl.  Mike Buschetti.  Mike Buschetti in the fucking house.  Big A.  Fucking credits in the fucking. 
[01:40:30]  What credit do you have, bitch?  Crazy.  Why is she fucking here?  I'm just saying, you have no credits, bitch.  Hold on, let's ask her.  No credits, bitch.  No credits.  Lady Di, what's your credits?  My credits?  A lot of people in this room have credits.  What's your credits?  Well, I know how to work a computer.  I do it every day.  My husband jumped in front of a train.  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  That's a credit. 
[01:41:00]  That's a mic.  That's a credit.  That's a credit.  Talking to the mic.  Okay.  That's a credit, baby.  You're going to take that?  It's a credit.  You're going to take that shit.  Why do you have to bring up things that happened in the past?  Well.  That happened a long time ago.  Good point.  Good point.  Well, you talked about a fucking investment in the past.  What?  Bringing up things that have, that's the touche.  Well, that's true.  And he was not my husband.  Right.  All right?  Yeah.  Don't you think you have a kid with him now?  If we don't remember history, Don, you're condemned to repeat it. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know if he was a kid with him.  Oh.  My kid is 22 years old.  But only if it illuminates the present.  Right.  That's your credit, though.  No, it's a credit.  It's a credit, though.  Yeah.  It's a story.  It's a story, though.  He's got a, he's got a, she's got a philosophical discussion over this shit.  No, I'm just saying.  I said what to do with Big A's act is going to be like.  How about Dennis takes us to break, and then let's get into Big A's act and everyone else's  talent.  So what about my fucking song here?  We played it.  It was great.  It was awesome.  We played it.  We played it.  I swear to God, we played it. 
[01:42:00]  I didn't hear it.  Your head called.  I'm not going to sing to it and do a strip to it.  Well, maybe we can do that a little later for the talent portion.  Oh, hey.  For the talent portion.  For the talent portion.  For the talent portion.  I thought you were doing the talent show.  No, no.  Didn't she do a belly dance?  Not yet.  Not yet.  To know you.  Sandy, Sandy, they played a little bit of your song.  What about, what, why, hey.  I think we should go out.  You know something?  Yeah.  It's serious is a very, very big music.  You know, I've been doing fucking Opie and Anthony for 15 years. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, my God.  You could at least play the fucking song.  Well, you're going to play it.  Why I'm bitter, why I jumped in front of a train myself.  Oh, shit.  Because my friends don't fucking play a fucking three-minute song.  I mean, I went to Nashville.  That's, you know, I mean, I didn't get into showbiz to show titties, even though I'm wearing  my pasties.  Because I never leave home now.  This is the ramblings of a mad woman.  But you are going to perform the song after the break.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  Yeah, we've got to pace it out a little bit.  All right, let's go to Dennis Falcone.  Take us out of here for a while.  Dennis, let's go on.  Danny, I think you should take that little rub and plant, maybe.  Why don't you play I Love Dick?  Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together.  The Super Show 3, I tell you.  We're going to keep this party going.  Yeah.  All right, we're back. 
[01:43:30]  Thank you, Dennis Falcone.  Colin Quinn in studio.  We're about to get the talent portion of the Super Show going here.  Danny didn't like that production.  Why don't you like the production pieces, man?  Look, I ask you to do one thing and don't do that anymore.  Because it bothers me.  Wait, could you replay that again?  No, you don't have to replay it.  What part bothered you?  Take that card out and erase it.  But I don't know what part bothered you.  Just the whole thing about the implication about that. 
[01:44:00]  We've got one of the great voice guys around here to, you know, to do some nice stuff for you.  And you're mad?  Can I hear that again?  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, please.  Now back to the Opie and Anthony Super Show.  That sounds great.  Here's your self-sucking DJ.  We didn't say it didn't sound great.  Dennis Falcone.  What's the text I didn't like?  You've got a great voice.  Self-sucking, self-sucking DJ.  Now, are you embarrassed that you can do that?  Because I don't do that.  I can hardly walk.  You think I can bend my legs to do that?  Come on. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, so you've tried that.  No, I've never tried that.  I understand.  Dennis, were you all right with the other two?  Everything was wonderful.  Okay, good.  Oh, so you like the other one?  What was the other one?  Yeah.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Super Show.  That's nice.  Here's how's DJ Tinkle Lord Dennis Falcone.  You can just cut that.  You can't give me that little Tinkle Lord.  Wow.  That's brutal.  You said you liked the other ones.  No, I just liked it to that point.  I think we actually, like every DJ has drops to shout your name out while you're performing. 
[01:45:00]  I think we've got some drops for him if he wants to.  Do you have some?  Dennis Falcone is in the mix, self-polleting on you bitches.  Oh, shit.  You can just edit to in the mix.  That's pretty cool, though.  You're in the mix with Dennis Falcone sucking himself.  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Wow, it's beautiful.  The production value is very nice.  You talk about how magic is being produced in these studios.  I think that's a lot of magic right there. 
[01:45:30]  Do you think that's a lot of magic?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The last part is what's offensive.  All right, why don't we get the men to do their talents?  Who do you want first?  We need some talents.  We've been discussing things behind the scenes.  What about Big A?  Well, Sandy Kane is like a professional, so she's going to perform and then we want her  to be the judge for the rest of the talent show.  Maybe Sandy Kane performs either first or last.  First.  Okay.  Yeah, let's get her out of the way. 
[01:46:00]  Is Bobo practicing magic still?  Yeah, he's got a magic kit and a magic deck of cards, and he's been familiarizing himself  with all the tricks.  He's got a levitating trick.  He's got a whole bunch of stuff.  How great would it be if he was really a savant and had an amazing sleight of hand?  Well, that's what it is.  It's all about the sleight of hand with Bobo.  Yeah, that's good.  All right, you want to Sandy Kane to start?  What would you equate him with as far as a magician goes?  I mean, I thought David Copperfield was very inspiring, but he's more of, because he's 
[01:46:30]  so mysterious, he's kind of a David Blaine sort of, is he a wizard or is it, you know?  Mysterious Maloonigans.  The mysterious Maloonigans the Magnificent.  Dianne, the pickup here, I got it.  I love it.  Magic Man.  Ah, very good.  That's good stuff.  Let's get going, man.  We're running out of time.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it's 9 o'clock already. 
[01:47:00]  Right?  Sandy Kane looks like, I was just watching Planet of the Apes the other day.  Remember the time capsule that broke on the women on the ship that was supposed to be like  the new Eve?  By the way, you're talking about a woman, and you know who she looks like.  I was watching Planet of the Apes.  It's never going to be a compliment.  No, no, no, I wasn't going to say Nova.  Oh, right.  Nova, I taught you to smile.  What a cunt Nova was.  Ah, really?  Oh, a little mixing going on from Dennis Falcone. 
[01:47:30]  Sorry, yeah.  You're in the mix with Dennis Falcone sucking himself.  Honeydrip is not.  Thank you, Travis.  I thought we were friends.  He looks like Honeydrip is Robert Plant.  Robert Plant, Honeydrip is Robert Plant.  Robert's ears.  Not song remains the same.  I'm waiting for people to come down the hall.  Goodfellas.  Goodfellas right here.  Yeah.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. 
[01:48:00]  Sandy came back in studio.  Sandy.  All right.  And then I was stubborn in the sauce, but then you got to, you know, I got to take the  guns over to Jimmy, but, you know, the wrong guns, the helicopter's chasing me.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Sandy, very good news.  What?  Very good news.  We all have decided in studio that you're obviously a professional.  Yes.  So we're going to have you perform your song, and then you're not part of this talent show.  You're going to be a judge.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Because you've got America's Got Talent twice. 
[01:48:30]  I am?  You don't know how I'm a superstar.  How did they pick you?  I was on 46th Street and Broadway, and an agent came over to me.  I was wearing blue hair, and she said, I'm with America's Got Talent, and she said, perform  for the people.  So I'm like playing the guitar, and all of a sudden a big crowd, and I'm singing, I love  Dick, he's sweeter than ice cream on his day, Dick.  And so here's my card. 
[01:49:00]  She called me six months later, and then they called me for the, I was on with I Love Nick  with Nick Cannon, and then they flew me to Hollywood.  Oh, I remember that.  I do remember that.  They flew you to Hollywood?  They flew me to Hollywood.  They flew you to first class?  Um, yeah, it was pretty early in the morning on United.  It was not that classy.  No, I'm just saying, man.  It was like, I had to get up real early and shit.  She's the best.  But, you know, it was great.  You know where they put me in the, um, there's, in Beverly Hills, there's a gorgeous hotel with 
[01:49:30]  a Novotel, I think.  Yeah, Novotel.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah, so, and the cannon was there.  So, um, then I was a superstar, and we did another show.  Did you suck his dick?  I would have liked to, but Mariah, I'm married.  I don't know if you saw the clip.  I'm married, jeez.  No, because when, it was like, it was a long story.  But, you know.  All right, why don't we perform, Sandy?  Okay, bitch in the house, folks.  What do you need us to do? 
[01:50:00]  So, I'm a professional.  Yes, you are.  You need your track?  Uh, I'd like to hear it, right?  What track?  Um, I, um, he taught me how to love.  Okay.  Why don't we do that?  You gotta get headphones on so you can hear this.  How funny was Dennis just now playing Jesus Christ?  Jesus Christ Superstar.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, thanks, sir.  The original cast album.  I thought he meant, like, Jesus Christ.  Ian Gillian was in that, right?  Oh, from, uh, Sabbath and Dick Cripple.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got a fucking amazing voice.  He really does, man.  Yeah.  This is, um, the story of Sandy Kane. 
[01:50:30]  I wrote this song many years ago.  I love a backstory on the song.  Behind the music.  Yeah, behind the fucking music.  And, um, it was originally produced by Eddie O'Loughlin.  Uh, we played it once.  Remember, we played the original Sandy Kane version when I was like a baby.  And, uh, Eddie O'Loughlin produced it.  And now he's the one that is responsible for the voice.  He went to Holland and brought the show back.  So, Eddie O'Loughlin, um, he was the original producer. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  Don't say O'Loughlin anymore.  Right.  Who originally produced this one?  Me.  Oh.  Who's the original producer?  Uh, Eddie O'Loughlin.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Well, well, well.  Nothing.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  How come he doesn't help you now?  He's on the voice.  Yeah, I said to him, uh, hey, Eddie, uh, now you have the voice.  I said, put me on.  He says, they're looking for the next Whitney Houston.  And then, um, two, two months later, she's dead.  So, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  So, no, I said to him to help me.  But, you know, it's a problem.  What happens, you know?  Yeah, but still, it's a good help.  And, you know, Eddie O'Loughlin heard the show.  Someone called him and said, hey, I heard you mention my name in Opie and Anthony.  Who?  Eddie O'Loughlin.  He said, I heard you, you, um, said I produced it.  I said, no, the original Eddie.  Don't get so fucking mad.  You should be glad we're, I'm talking about you on Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's Eddie O'Loughlin.  If you're listening, he's going to listen now.  Who's going to listen? 
[01:52:00]  Eddie O'Loughlin.  Oh, you asshole.  But he's, hey, he's a very brilliant man.  He has the voice.  Yeah, but he could help you out there and put you on there.  Right.  Bitch.  That's the way, you know, the biz news, you know, it's like, there's no idea.  All right, all right.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we get before him?  Yeah, what can you do?  Colin's head is swimming.  Here we go.  I'm sure it sucks his cock.  All right, here we go.  Huh?  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go. 
[01:52:30]  And I taught him to make you things too. 
[01:53:00]  He taught me how to love.  Yeah, he showed me what to do.  Oh, he taught me how to love.  Now, Lord, I'm loving you.  Since I got back from Nashville, things just ain't been the same. 
[01:53:30]  Since I met that man named Anthony and Opie and Colin and Jim.  You know what?  You know what?  They taught me how to love.  They showed me what to do.  They taught me how to love.  And I taught them a few things too.  They taught me how to love. 
[01:54:00]  And they broke my heart and they broke my heart in suit.  They taught me how to love.  Now, Lord, I'm loving you.  What happened?  Woo!  Come on, man.  That was damn good.  That was very good.  All right.  There's still more, baby.  Fucking talk radio.  What happened to the music?  There's Danny.  You're like the coal miner shovel.  I don't have that track.  You don't have it?  No. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know.  Where's his phone?  No, no.  And now, and now, and now, I'm loving you.  Yeah, we're back.  We're back.  Now, ever since I got back from Nashville first, I met this guy.  His name was Steve.  And he had a really big dick.  Oh.  And so, anyway, we met in a bar, man.  And he said to me, Sandy Kane, I think you got big fucking titties.  Would you like to screw like a country guy would do? 
[01:55:00]  And so, we did.  So, what's the rest of the song, man?  Danny, why'd you do that?  Find it, Danny.  Jesus.  I'm looking for it.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Hallelujah.  Anyway, Steve.  Steve Smithson.  Y'all.  It's like if Loretta Lynn went on The Walking Dead.  And now, I'm loving you.  Shovel.  You show me what to do.  I'm bored.  A coal miner shovel.  You make me show my asshole and my fucking my hemorrhoid, too. 
[01:55:30]  The hemorrhoid makes an appearance.  And that's why I'd always hear, too.  And my fucking smelly pussy, too.  And you taught me how to love.  This is the professional exposition song.  Everybody, you taught me how to love.  A little anti-Semitism never heard in a country song.  I really don't understand why they don't want her for the voice. 
[01:56:00]  Right?  She's perfect for it.  Yeah, but that guy could help you out and put you on the voice.  Yeah.  Who?  Hey, Eddie, if you're fucking listening or your friends are listening and they tell them  that you're on the fucking show, you should be honored and put Sandy Cain on the fucking  voice, asshole.  Who are you talking about?  Eddie O'Loughlin.  Oh.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  He showed me how to screw who.  He showed me how to screw who.  He taught me, but you take me places I never knew I knew. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Oh, right.  You've never had a bad song, I've seen it.  That's nice.  That's not.  Colin, baby.  Who did the music?  Who did that slide guitar?  Nashville, Tennessee.  Omni.  Steel guitar.  Omni Studios.  Omni Studios.  Yeah, man, I did.  And did you have a steel guitar player and everything?  Of course.  Wow.  He taught me how to love.  That's great.  And he broke my heart in two.  He taught me how to love. 
[01:57:00]  That's great.  He taught me how to love.  That's great.  And I taught him a few things to him.  And now, Lord, I'm loving you.  Aren't we all?  He taught me how to love.  Woo!  Yeah, he showed me what to do.  Woo!  He taught me how to love. 
[01:57:30]  And I taught him a few things to him.  Sandy Kane, everyone.  Sandy Kane.  Let me ask you, the dirty, you put some dirty parts in.  Are they actually in the song?  No, no.  Oh, you just improv them.  Yeah, there's a lot.  Yeah.  It's just the women.  You know, they're very, very, very, it's too edgy.  So you have to be, that's why this song is really straight.  Can you play that song just like on a guitar and sing it straight?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could probably sell that to like Carrie Underwood or somebody. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, just.  Without the dirty parts.  I don't think Carrie will sing that or her.  That's just it.  It's so hard to get to other artists.  Who wrote that?  I did.  Did you?  Oh, yeah, I'm a song of fucking ASCAP.  Under the name Ratsy Cline.  Eddie O'Loughlin in the fucking house.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  Fucking Eddie.  Jesus.  Fucking Eddie.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  All right, take a seat.  Thanks for remembering your friends, Eddie.  I guess about that name.  All right, Eddie.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  Yeah, fuck.  Shut the fuck up.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  Sam, tell Roland about it.  Sam, tell Roland about it.  You're going to die and go get me out of the fucking, put that high coffee in his face.  All right, Sandy.  All right, Sandy Cain will be mic'd every once in a while.  Yes.  At a talent show.  Sandy, you just have a seat, relax, and enjoy the show.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  Do you want the chair moved a little bit so you can see better?  Sam, move her chair so she can see better.  Jim Norton's laughing like Mark Wahlberg in Bully Nights at the drug dealer's house. 
[01:59:00]  Right, yes.  He's just going to stop laughing.  God.  All right.  All right.  That's a good, that's a very catchy song.  Thank you.  Oh, thanks.  I'm more than I will take.  Great.  Thanks.  Very nice.  All right.  It's catchy, that's all.  She taught me how to love.  Yeah.  She taught me how to screw.  You know, that's how all these national artists get started.  They sell their songs.  Yes.  Yeah, but it's so impossible, man.  We got to mic Sandy, too, because she'll have to weigh in on us. 
[01:59:30]  I like Sandy's casual phrase, I should have sucked his dick.  Yeah.  Give me the name of your autobiography.  I should have sucked his dick.  That would make a great title for her book.  I should have sucked his dick.  I love dick.  Or a t-shirt.  You know how funny?  I should have sucked his dick.  Oh, wow.  Let's get just enough primal truth to it.  He loves stories, though.  Black artists.  That would be an amazing movie, a book, a movie. 
[02:00:00]  Just amazing stories filled with celebrities.  Exactly.  Sex.  How are you doing?  Ah.  I love dick.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Who are we bringing in next?  Should we go with Dr. Patty?  Maybe Anne Hathaway playing this one.  Harry Nilsson.  Playing the young Sandy Kane, Anne Hathaway.  Suckin' on dick, dick, Sean's dick.  I can't say dick.  Scarlett Johansson, maybe.  Scarlett Johansson, playing the young Sandy Kane.  Scarlett Johansson.  Oh, there we go. 
[02:00:30]  First up.  Hi, Patty.  As part of the talent show.  It's all best dressed, maybe Patty.  She looks really hot.  Patty.  Yeah, she does.  Lots of cleavage, I see, there.  Socks.  59 years old there, Colin.  Shucks.  Still a version.  I said, no, that's...  How do I, um...  It agrees with the look.  She looks fantastic.  Oh, she's certainly...  She never ages, Patty.  Yeah, she does.  She looks younger, man.  You look good, Patty.  Remember when she used to sleep on your couch? 
[02:01:00]  Wow.  Come a long way, man.  Those are the kind of flirting shoes you're wearing, too.  Oh, thank you.  Patty, Patty, look over here.  Patty, Patty.  Patty.  All right.  Pat, what are you going to do for us today, Patty?  A couple of impressions.  Impressions?  Yeah, at the spur of the moment, too.  Wow.  This is pretty good.  My first...  Well, what, what, you're going to do, like, where you turn around and go,  it might go something like this. 
[02:01:30]  That's a great idea.  And then you turn around, and then you come back in character.  I like that.  You know, you watch those old variety shows.  Yeah.  So let's do it that way.  And you've got to perform for Santa Cain.  Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Gorsham!  Shit like that.  Did you fuck Frank Gorsham?  Not yet.  I loved him.  I should have done this thing.  I should have.  Fuck.  All right.  First one I'll do is a few excerpts from Sister Mary Elephant from Cheech and Chong. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah!  Okay.  Break out your giant rolling paper.  Yeah, right, right.  Big doobie from Big Bamboo.  They were great.  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever fuck Cheech and Chong?  Well, I would, you know, I just recently became a fan of their movies.  Wow.  And they're so...  This happened recently.  Yeah, no, they're on the IFC channel, and they're hysterical.  You know who's in Up and Smoke?  Who?  The voice of our show, Stacey Keech, playing Officer Stadanko. 
[02:02:30]  Wow.  One of his funniest roles ever.  That's right.  Love him.  Oh, playing that officer, that was him.  Yeah.  Oh, still.  He was obsessed with getting Cheech and Chong and busting them.  Yeah, that was a great bit.  Stacey Keech, our own Stacey Keech.  All right, Patty.  Yeah.  He's on here?  Well, his voice.  He does the voice.  He's the one that goes, the Opie and Anthony show.  He's the one that goes, him?  Yes.  He's very, very...  Oh, I didn't know that.  He's got a great voice.  Let's go, Patty, because we're running out of time here.  Step it up. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Class, class, we all know who I am, but let's find out who you are.  Young man, now give me that knife.  Eee!  Eee!  Okay.  Call.  Call.  You like that?  We're going to do what we did on our summer vacation.  Young man, state your name and tell us what you did on your summer vacation. 
[02:03:30]  Young class, class, shut up!  Then the student gets up.  This student gets up and says, what I did.  No, what I did on my summer vacation.  On the first day of my summer vacation, I woke up.  Then I went downtown to look for a job. 
[02:04:00]  Then I hung out in front of the drugstore.  On the second day of my summer vacation, I woke up.  Then I went downtown to look for a job.  Then I hung out in front of the drugstore.  The third day, I found a job.  Keeping kids from hanging out in front of the drugstore. 
[02:04:30]  That was impression one, then.  Wow.  Wow.  I thought I was transported back to the 70s.  Yes.  Listening to Cheech and Chong.  Cheech and Chong records.  Before we judge, I think she has one more impression.  Oh, you do?  Give this one more.  In 1963, in May, on John F. Kennedy's birthday, in Madison Square Garden, an actress stepped  up to the podium and sang Happy Birthday to John F. Kennedy.  I'd be less uncomfortable if you did November 22nd of 63. 
[02:05:00]  No, it was his birthday's in May.  Anyway.  So Marilyn Monroe stepped up and very gingerly went up and sang, Happy Birthday to you.  Happy Birthday to you.  Happy Birthday, Mr. President. 
[02:05:30]  Comes off more like Mrs. Voorhees.  Happy Birthday to you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Oh, that was really nice.  Thank you.  Kill them, Mommy.  Kill them.  No more impression in on the spur at the moment.  Well, let's go to Sandy Cain.  Sandy.  Now, can you do Joan Rivers?  Uh, Joan Rivers?  Yeah.  Like, my face is freezing.  I gotta go.  Or something like that, that commercial. 
[02:06:00]  Holy mother of fuck.  Okay.  Okay, no, it's just absolutely, absolutely.  Okay, now I'm just saying, very good.  Uh, okay, no.  Uh, uh.  You're like rich little talent.  Rich little.  Thank you.  I'll accept that.  Um.  Um.  Eh.  Terrible.  Well, I don't know.  I did see the Cheech and Chong movies, and, uh, you didn't sound at all like, didn't bring 
[02:06:30]  back.  She's brutally honest.  Maybe, maybe you have to smoke a joint, and then maybe do them.  You don't smoke, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  No.  So, the other law, and you put it down, because their whole thing was smoking pot was a good  thing, and a fun thing.  Uh-huh.  Not really.  Yeah.  That's what they did.  She's like the Simon Cowell of us.  Yeah, no, she's, you know, the, she's, you know, the, she's, you know, the, she's  drunk free.  Totally honest.  So, it's hard to say, you know, do someone that's drug free.  Well, what about the Marilyn Monroe?  Oh, that was really kind of sexy. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, your eyes.  Sexy.  I tried to imitate her breathy voice.  Yeah, I, I think that if anything, if anything, that was the best.  I mean, that was, that was as good as, you know, you got.  So, okay.  So, number two was better than that.  Would you like to see her tits?  I don't think, I don't think Eddie O'Loughlin's going to hire her for the voice.  Say to Kay.  Eddie O'Loughlin.  Say to Kay, would you like to see her, uh, tits before you give her.  Or her ass.  What about her nice pantyhose?  Yeah, that, that would be good. 
[02:07:30]  Fucking pantyhose, babe.  No.  Take a tit out once.  You can at least take one tit.  You can see my pantyhose, okay?  Oh, nice.  All right.  Okay, what about a tit?  One tit.  Okay, no, let's keeping it clean here.  What, you don't, you don't show tits anymore?  You're a prude?  What happened?  Yeah, we let it out.  I think that's 59.  Well, she doesn't work in Manhattan anymore.  She works in Staten Island, so maybe it's affecting you.  It was okay when you were 57?  Right. 
[02:08:00]  That's a great line, though.  I'm 59.  I think we've seen enough of them in the past.  Sandy hasn't seen enough.  She's got a point.  I haven't seen, you have nipples, right?  Yeah.  You're luckier than me.  I have big titties with no nipples, so it's great to see a nipple once in a while.  Yeah, it's sharp.  How do you do it?  You're a good egg.  Yeah.  You don't show me anything.  Chest.  You can't see.  All right.  I don't want this on my Facebook, please, because I have people.  Sit on my Facebook. 
[02:08:30]  Sit on my fucking Facebook.  Come on, daddy.  Come on, baby.  Come on, man.  Do you have a 1 to 10 ranking to give, Patty?  Is there a minus?  Thank you.  Minus for two.  No, I hate to, you know.  Just be honest.  You've got to be honest.  Okay.  Okay, let's really be honest.  You suck.  I don't think you're going to.  Starring Patty, you can now be honest to Sandy Kane. 
[02:09:00]  What do you mean?  Whatever you want to say to her.  What can I say?  You know she used to be a hooker, right?  Well, yeah, I know that.  She used to work in the peep shows.  And then I got trichomonas, so I forgot it.  Thank God.  What?  I got trichomonas.  What's trichomonas?  What is that?  No, I see what that is.  Fool and monas?  No, trichomonas.  No, trichomonas is like you get this, like, drip, and it smells really bad.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Even though any of you felt just like that. 
[02:09:30]  No, I know.  I know.  It's just I haven't seen.  I was very heavy into cocaine in those days.  Oh, my God.  What did it smell like?  Where would it drip?  Hon, it just, in my underwear.  And what did it smell like?  Oh, it really was the worst smell you ever want.  Well, it really smelled something like when a man comes in you and you don't douche.  That's what it smelled like.  Like a fishy odor.  Like Jim's ass?  Yeah.  It really smelled bad. 
[02:10:00]  So, it was, you know, I hid for two.  Thank God I had my guitar.  It was just me and my guitar.  No one to be near me.  And, you know, it was a very serious thing.  So, I took pills and I finally went away.  How long did it smell for?  It was like two weeks.  And I also got it once before when I went to L.A.  The first time I went to Hollywood.  Oh, shit.  I saw him because of the Eddie Lockman man.  Oh, God.  And I fucked 11 men.  Fuck that guy.  You fucked 11 men.  I fucked 11.  That was, I think, DeMond Wilson was. 
[02:10:30]  DeMond Wilson.  Yeah, yeah.  That was 11.  11.  I was like, how long were you there?  I was on Quaaludes in those days.  So, I mean.  How long were you there?  And how long of a period of time?  About a month.  One month, 11 men.  Yeah.  And then I came back.  Black guys, white guys, didn't matter.  Well, it was really basically only one black guy, DeMond.  DeMond Wilson.  The rest was like.  Did he have a big penis?  Yeah.  Big dick.  Yeah.  He was good.  He was good.  He was good. 
[02:11:00]  You like his dick?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  Got a big dick, dummy.  Oh, baby.  Ah.  He had a big cock.  Sorry, son.  Very big.  Very big cock.  So.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  We're right on the show here.  Thank you, Matty.  Thank you.  Smelly drip.  Wow, that's amazing, that story.  What do we got next?  Maybe Oscar or what do you want to...  Oscar's next.  Let's bring Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Oscar's very nervous.  Moniz.  A very nervous guy.  Oh, shit.  Here he comes.  Oscar.  Hello.  Hi, Aspen.  Hey.  Hello.  How you guys doing?  How you doing? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, good.  Good.  Yeah.  Are you having fun so far?  Oh, hell.  I've been having a blast, man.  It's just a...  What's the super show?  Any highlights, anything you can talk about behind the scenes that has been going on?  Oh, no.  Just me and Mike.  We're just having an interesting conversation.  You know, just a...  About what?  Oh, it's...  More warehouse conversations?  No, just a bottle of different walks of life and different realms that we tend to explore.  What's that?  Oh, no.  Just like...  He was talking about comedy and I was talking about how to...  You know, me and the band, how we got together and everything.  So, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  And now how to pick up girls on Tinder, too.  Have you been lucky with that?  No, I don't have...  I have my phone shitty.  I can't download the app because I have a Windows phone, so I can't...  I don't have that app.  Oh.  Yeah, I just go to Casual Encounters on Craigslist.  Oh.  Yeah, there's just some good stuff there, man.  Have you met anyone for free?  Yeah, it's called Girl Wendy.  She was fat as hell, dude.  Wow.  Like pH?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  Fat.  F.  F.  F.  F.

He aims to please.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  All the ladies of all shapes and sizes.  Do you like them fat every once in a while?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  No, it's a little meat on them.  No, when they're too skinny, man, I mean, it's just...  What about...  I mean, with a guy my size, man, I feel like I'm gonna break him in half, man.  How fat?  How fat are you?  Oh, I mean, like, about 220.  I think that's the limit.  220?  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Muscular.  If you're gonna fuck 220, why wouldn't you just 250?  No, fuck!  That's too fat?  Yeah.  220 or 250?  Who gives a shit at that point?  Do they have folds where there's crust under...  Oh, no, no crust.  No neck crust, no shit like that?  How does the pussy look in a 220-pound woman?  It's great.  Really?  Why?  It's great, man.  Why?  Oh, just...  You know, you get excited and...  It'll look like cow lifts.  Doesn't his stomach hang over the pussy?  No, no, not that.  No, no. 
[02:13:30]  What, do you have to lift his stomach up?  You have to think about this.  20 is a lot of weight.  There's a height to weight ratio.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you're 220 and about my size, it's a great body, man.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  That's good.  There they go, right?  Yeah.  220 is a lot of weight.  Crazy.  Have you been with girls about 220?  Well, you know, I've never had a...  Oh, well, you have to.  Never had a lesbian relationship.  I'm telling you, you have to.  That's the one thing I could always say.  I never had...  You should give it a try.  But then you never know.  But you think 220...  Not with that drink you had going.  Fuck.  Where is it? 
[02:14:00]  Where is the pussy?  How is this part of the talent show?  Thank you, Colin.  Colin's keeping us on point.  Yes.  No, but do you work clubs?  Do you work nightclubs?  Nightclubs?  Yeah.  Aren't you...  Isn't he a performer?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I do with the band.  Yeah.  Oh, you have a band?  Yeah, we just do local clubs.  Yeah, but so you meet a lot of women, huh?  Oh, yeah.  So why don't you go with those women that you meet?  You know, you're a performer and you're a celebrity up there.  No, I mean, because they're not interested. 
[02:14:30]  They look for a very particular kind of man.  Yeah, you know, the numbers are like around 180.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So there's weight talk.  Well, how much do you weigh?  Oh, I'm like 260.  No, who cares?  260?  I'd rather hear about that old Lachlan guy.  Oh, Eddie O'Lachlan had a small dick.  What the fuck?  Any other life.  You carry 260 well there, Oscar.  You're only 260.  He doesn't look at...  Not at all.  What makes your dick big or something?  Yeah.  Down to his knee.  Wow.  Down to his knee, maybe. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, no, see, the thing is what I found out, man.  Uh-huh.  It's just the type of women I go for, they're just looking for the perfect man.  And, you know, I have flaws, man.  I'm going to say I'm perfect.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they're a little too excited, sometimes a little too verbal.  So the way I express...  What do you say?  Like, hey, let's get fucking.  No, no.  Well, I'll just say it's like, hey, let's go waste it and have a great time, right?  But, like, you know, I'm looking at classy girls, and they can't say that to classy girls.  And then the type of guys, they're looking for it.  Let's get wasted and have a good time is a good fucking pickup line. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, no, no.  That's like you had me at hello.  You know, I've found out lately.  I just go out, and I just say, listen, I find you attractive.  Fucking, let's go out.  What does the dude say?  That's...  No, no, no.  What about let's smoke a joint, sometimes?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Guy got me that way.  You can't open up out of the gate with that.  I mean, it's just...  Oh, yeah, you could just say, let's get wasted and have a good time.  He likes his pot, Sandy King.  He likes his pot. 
[02:16:00]  No, but because someone got me that way, and he was like, let's smoke a joint.  Should we get onto the talent?  We should get onto the talent, as Colin suggested five minutes ago.  Okay, all right.  All right.  Christ in a fucking house.  All right.  All right, Oscar, it's all yours.  Oh, cool, yeah.  Here, let me swim this out.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  All right.  He's got the guitar case.  Nice.  I don't know what's in it.  Possibly a shotgun.  Machine gun.  An old tommy gun.  All right.  Oscar's scheduled a freestyle rap, but he's asked if he could use his guitar. 
[02:16:30]  I've never seen many rappers that play an acoustic guitar.  I know.  This could be something new.  This could be something new.  This could be something new.  Don't give it to Opie.  The new sound of the generation.  Don't give it to Opie.  Oh, that's right.  Please.  I don't want to go to a chord anymore.  Sam said, bring your guitar.  I said, no way.  Then what you're doing, you're taking a chord and don't show up.  Yeah.  It's a lot of...  What the way am I bringing a guitar?  I'm not much of a rapper, to be honest with you.  Uh?  No, I can't really rap.  So do you write... 
[02:17:00]  Do you write songs?  Uh, no, no.  Actually, this could be a cover about Alex Clare.  This is called Hold Ya.  Originally was performed by the Egyptian.  Egyptians.  Yep.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Wait a minute.  What happened to the freestyle rap?  Uh, oh, he's putting it on the floor.  You're going to be able to read that on the floor?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, just a cheesy name, just in case.  Okay.  Girl, I just want to hold you, build my world right around you, cause girl, you give me  the tightest hold I ever felt in my life.

She didn't have, she's not even good impressions, right?  Ah, there we go.  Yeah.  Hello?

And I, you know, I really, I think, um, that you learned the guitar and that's talent,  you know, and, and, um, um, I, um, but, um, I think, um, you, I don't know.  I never heard the first song.  If you're going to do so-and-song, why don't you do one that someone knows, like me, I do,  like, uh, um, you're nothing but a hound dog.
