<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in highly offensive and vulgar banter, filled with profanity and crude jokes, particularly targeting Norton's bowel movements.  This devolved into insults directed at each other and their staff.  The conversation then briefly touched upon Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial re-election campaign and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, marked by cynical commentary about public apathy.  A significant portion focused on a staff member, Eric, who won $100,000 in the lottery and the Daily News cropping him out of a celebratory photo.  Bill Burr's new HBO special was also discussed, prompting listener calls.

A lengthy and graphic anecdote dominated the show's middle section, detailing a bizarre encounter with a one-armed (later revealed to be fake) Bill O'Reilly producer, involving a near-bathtub incident, a Hooters party, and a beer fight.  The Hooters establishment, its dress code, and atmosphere were subsequently discussed at length.  This was followed by a discussion about Jim Norton's relentless pursuit of a photo with Robert Plant, described as "scary" and "horrible," and his planned photographic endeavors with Paul McCartney. A news report about offensive t-shirts sold at the San Gennaro Festival was played, sparking debate about appropriateness.  The hosts also discussed the impending Hurricane Rita and criticized the New Orleans mayor.  Their "Assault on the Media" contest was highlighted, detailing listener-submitted entries, including a disastrous attempt by an intern in New York involving a stolen sign and a successful Philadelphia attempt using an air horn and stickers.  Audio and video clips of both were mentioned.  Further topics included the hosts’ past employment struggles with XM Satellite Radio, Opie's extensive book reading (approximately 200 books), a humorous call about interrupting Cousin Brucey,  and a discussion about the Emmys.  A caller recounted using mescaline to cope with cold weather at football games.  Bill Byrne was a guest in the studio.

The show continued with a segment focusing on the hosts’ frustrating experiences searching for homes in expensive New York areas, detailing absurd encounters with real estate agents and overpriced, poorly maintained properties. This included a graphic description of one host's unusual defecation posture, compared to painting techniques and tampon insertion.  The high cost and poor condition of homes were discussed at length, alongside further discussion about the Emmy Awards.  The hosts offered unfiltered commentary on Star Jones' appearance and an interview segment, joking about her weight loss.  They also discussed the Black Eyed Peas' Michael Jackson reference and Martha Stewart's media image.  An extensive discussion on designer dog breeds followed, fueled by listener calls.  Hurricane Rita's impending landfall was briefly mentioned again, along with cynical remarks about media coverage.  Numerous caller contributions added to this segment.

A segment dedicated to the 2005 Emmy Awards heavily mocked Star Jones's red-carpet interviews, using derogatory and offensive comments about her race and weight.  Other celebrities, including Ray Liotta and Ellen DeGeneres, were also mocked. The hosts made insensitive remarks regarding Hurricane Katrina and offered crude jokes about Celine Dion and her husband.  Desperate Housewives' actresses were criticized, and sexually explicit jokes were made about the show.  A news story about a woman suing ABC for canceling her *Extreme Makeover* appearance was discussed.  The hosts also made fun of various Emmy performances, including one involving Donald Trump.

The show concluded with a brief, nonsensical coffee exchange, followed by an auction benefiting Hurricane Katrina victims.  Anthony then recounted their disastrous experience on the XFL pre-game show for NBC, describing an unruly audience that rendered much of the footage unusable.  E-Rock provided auction updates.  A bizarre interaction with a listener, "Radar on Wackbag," who won an auction item, was featured.  The broadcast ended with a discussion about the return to the moon, interspersed with listener calls and closing remarks.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Oh, very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink. 
[00:04:00]  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Oh, he's laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocked.  Hopefully, he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  That is.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are courtly invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it down.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  You like movies about gladiators?  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  Asshole!  You just mind the keys and cues, buster.  And remember who you're dealing with.  Stop it!  Stop it! 
[00:05:00]  Stop it!  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Love that one.  Ah, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  I'm running again for Goff in the...  And he'll be re-elected.  Did he do anything?  Do you think he will be?  I don't know.  I heard, like, he might have some problems.  You think?  You think?  You think they're on to him finally?  Uh, I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  He sounded all psyched when he gave his little speech.  Sounded like he did a lot of stuff.  We have recovered.  Now it's time to rebuild.  And there was some other odd thing that I had there.  Recovery.  Rebuild.  Re-Terminator 3.  Predator 5.  He wants the sequel.  That's what he does.  He knows that every...  Like, I didn't like the Jews.  The Jews.  I want to get rid of all the kikes in California.  Except for in Hollywood. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, so he's running.  He wants to run again.  All right.  See if he does anything.  Well, good luck to Arnold.  The power's on and everything's good.  Taxes haven't been raised.  I heard him just babbling about something.  It's so hard to take him seriously as a politician.  Do we have a speech?  I don't know.  You got any of that?  We got any audio from Arnold Schwarzenegger?  It was like Friday, I think.  What, Steve?  Martini Stevens studio.  Very early.  Very early.  I'm curious for you, Steve. 
[00:06:30]  His car is still charging.  He pulled the mic boom out again.  His car is still charging in the office.  No, we don't have it right now, but I'm going to look and see if we can grab it.  Yeah.  It was on CNN, but then they had to switch away from it to go to some hurricane stuff.  It meant nothing to me anymore.  Are you still watching it?  Nah.  Do you care anymore?  Nah, not really.  It's over.  Like, people down there, it's still just as horrific as it was.  There are some people that are getting back, you know, doing it.  But for a lot of people, still just as horrific as it was day one. 
[00:07:00]  But the American public right now, damn done with it.  Story's over.  It's old news.  Don't care.  I felt that last night on stage.  Did you?  Yeah, yeah.  Just doing my Hurricane Katrina chunk.  Chunk.  And, yeah, you just feel like, yeah, all right, whatever.  And then I had to, like, add new shit.  Now the bid has evolved into the people who actually steal the funds.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  The phony charities.  Next week I'll be talking about people raking, raking up the leaves. 
[00:07:30]  It's just like, dude, the premise is over.  Move on.  It's done.  There's no real heat anymore.  Yeah, you look at the front pages of all the newspapers.  We're done with it.  It's all about the Emmys now.  Half of the page on the New York Post is the four million scratch and win.  New card game inside.  Right.  So I guess there's a new one there, Eric.  You might want to get in on that.  Are you allowed to win again?  Different paper.  Oh, that's right.  What do I know?  Post.  You think the Post would crop your picture so not one bit of Opie and Anthony are in the picture that they took? 
[00:08:00]  Those motherfuckers over there at the Daily News.  He wins $100,000.  They come in to take a picture of him.  He makes sure he's standing in front of the big Opie and Anthony sign.  He's wearing like an O&A shirt and everything.  They cropped it like you saw his eyes, nose, and mouth.  That was it.  They did not want to advertise this program.  Oh, I thought you guys were in the photo too, like you actually waited around for a half hour.  That would have been good.  Like that fucking dude dating like a Hollywood starlet that nobody knows.  He's standing there on the red carpet like he's going to be in there. 
[00:08:30]  Now my acting career is going to soar.  No, buddy.  Yeah, they cut him right out.  If I hung out for an hour to take a picture, that would have been a story in itself newsworthy.  I am out of here at 11 o'clock.  Very, very good.  Hanging out watching Eric take a picture.  There it is.  And I must say, this is from yesterday's Daily News.  I didn't see the rest of the proud winners.  Again, Eric, you look miserable.  You won $100,000.  Will you smile?  Be happy.  You are a miserable fuck. 
[00:09:00]  Can you be happy?  Oh, yeah.  I'm good.  Oh, Nathaniel's saying that's his smug look.  Is that your smug look?  Yeah, I won, motherfucker.  Look at him.  Let's see.  There's a couple of old ladies, a black woman, and Eric.  Wow.  That's some demographic you got there.  Queens, two from the Bronx, and one from Brooklyn. 
[00:09:30]  Representing.  See that?  Yeah, I saw it in the paper yesterday.  Eric, you look really sad.  Everyone else is smiling.  You're that miserable around here?  No.  Is that it?  Not at all.  What was the look for?  It was 2 o'clock.  I was tired.  The best part, Eric goes, yeah, they used a bad picture.  But you're not even smiling.  You're not even attempting to look happy.  Later on, he's like, do you think you could smile?  So he took a few more with me smiling in front of the side.  And they didn't use it?  They didn't use it.  Yeah, you want $100,000 of our money. 
[00:10:00]  Could you smile?  Asshole, could you smile?  This was a big deal for us.  They cropped his picture so much that his picture is actually popping out of the little square frame they made of it.  Right.  It shows you, like, dimension.  Yeah, is that it?  A little 3D action.  Yeah.  He's probably going to get investigated.  It looks like he stole it, doesn't it?  Like he doctored the ticket.  He won't pay taxes on it.  There'll be a big problem.  This will just cause him problems.  Yeah.  You going to pay taxes on that, cabbie? 
[00:10:30]  Or are you just going to say fucking...  Oh, wow.  Copy of the check.  The actual check.  Daily News.  The sum of $100,000.  Wow.  That's nice.  Did you take it to the bank?  Not yet.  No?  Why did you cross out your address?  You thought we were going to read it on the air or something?  Of course.  They can't send people over to the Nagel estate.  The security cameras will pick it up and he'll have to send his men out. 
[00:11:00]  That's pretty cool, though, man.  That is.  $100,000 from the Daily News.  What are you going to do now when you bring it to the bank?  You've got to wait.  Let me give you a pointer here, my friend.  You wait until one of the attractive female tellers are open.  And you bring that up and just kind of throw it like you do it all the time.  It's like, there you go.  Here's my weekly paycheck.  And then that might spark a little conversation.  Before you know it, you're in.  Dating a hot banker.  Yeah, that Daily News.  I'm a photographer. 
[00:11:30]  You know that picture that I had of J-Lo, Beyonce in there?  That was me.  I took that one.  I think you'd take a few pictures.  You could wheel that into a chick and the money.  That's not a bad idea.  Do it.  And you buy a fake Pulitzer prize for when you get it back to your apartment.  That's the Pulitzer.  I don't know.  I was over in Iraq the first time.  Yeah, yeah.  The real one.  Right.  She'd buy it.  A hundred grand, my friend.  Daily News is right on the check. 
[00:12:00]  There you go.  It was legit.  He's got the check and the picture in the paper to prove it.  You know when the ecstasy of gold music was starting up?  Yeah.  And we were getting ready for the show and we were discussing some things and I ran out of here?  Yeah.  In the middle of some heavy duty conversations getting the show all set?  Wow.  I ran into the bathroom and had the green apple splatters.  Stop it.  Why do you share that stuff?  I have to share it because now I'm thinking it's going to be a thing that's going to be happening throughout the whole show.  You don't just have that once. 
[00:12:30]  Sometimes you get lucky.  Sometimes you get lucky and have the green apple splatters one time?  Yeah.  Once only?  If it's only once, your insides feel like they're falling out.  Like if it's just a little one time.  Right.  No, I already feel the gurgling of round two.  Sometimes you have the gurgle though, that'll happen, and then you finish up that whole act with a bit of normalcy.  And it's like, oh, it's done.  I was taken care of.  You can tell if it's a low intestinal grumble and pain. 
[00:13:00]  If it's high up, you know it's got a lot of track to go through.  I'm not even kidding.  If it's low, you know it's ready to go and you'll be done.  I'll point it out.  Oh, don't point it out.  Oh, it's up that high?  It's really high.  Jesus.  It's in your esophagus.  It's like, I think it's what I just ate for breakfast.  Oh, God.  Already working his way down.  So I just want to throw that on the table today.  Oh, thank you.  I'm not going to be running in and out.  Dude, every day you eat like a bowl of bran and blueberries.  You've already noticed, right?  Yeah.  We have goofed on him for years about this. 
[00:13:30]  He comes in.  We all get like, what do you get when you're in New York early?  A bagel, some cream cheese on it.  You eat a plain bagel and you drink seltzer water.  That's weird, too.  That's it.  I know it's a little weird, but you're like concocting stuff like you should be in a bed  and breakfast in Vermont.  It's like a fucking mixing bowl, too.  Yeah.  It's not like some little thing.  It's like half the box is in there.  Right.  It's steel-cut oatmeal, guys.  What?  Steel-cut.  What is steel-cut?  Well, you know, I was having the problem with the, well, we have to go down this road again.  You know, I was having a problem with the pooping, right? 
[00:14:00]  For someone who eats supposedly so healthy, your bowel movements are awful.  You can't get a balance.  Well, I learned that if you have the regular oatmeal, you know, it kind of clogs up the  system.  You have to have the steel-cut oatmeal.  What is steel-cut oatmeal?  I don't know what it is.  It cuts through the other fecal matter.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  That makes as much sense as anything else.  All right.  It has a serrated edge to it.  It's viscosity.  More of the stomach's acids can hit more surface because it's serrated. 
[00:14:30]  I like that.  It's tastier and it clears out the system nice, so that's all I know.  As opposed to what cut?  That regular oatmeal.  Stone-milled?  The regular oatmeal that takes...  Original cut.  Now introducing...  The regular...  New steel cut.  The regular Quaker oats that takes like one minute on the stove.  Right.  That stuff.  Oh, the stuff you cook.  Yeah.  But you're not cooking it.  No, I'm cooking the steel-cut oatmeal.  It takes like a half hour. 
[00:15:00]  It's a pain in the ass.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I wake up...  This isn't the cereal you're talking about.  This is oatmeal.  Yeah.  So you wake up and cook in the morning.  I wake up at like...  You're insane.  5.15, grab a cup of coffee, start the water, and then...  He cooks.  The steel-cut oatmeal has to cook for like a half hour, so while I'm showering and doing  everything else, it's just kind of...  Bubbling on your stove.  Bubbling and I cook it away, yeah.  All the mice sitting around in roaches waiting for you to drop some.  I haven't had any in a while.  Knock on whatever. 
[00:15:30]  That's horrid.  I think the mice are gone, so...  I just want to warn you guys.  I'm going to have to run out at any given moment now.  Yeah?  Because Bill was telling us about his weekend, the HBO thing, we're getting ready for the  show, and all of a sudden I felt like I abandoned everybody, but I couldn't help.  You did kind of run out pretty quickly.  It wasn't even one of those, I'll be right back.  I had to leave at that moment.  Oh, I thought I was bombing.  Fucking telling a real personal story.  Then my dog died, but he didn't die immediately.  His leg was still hanging.  Where are you going? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Hold that thought.  I'll be right back.  That's bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Did you have that real urgency when you got in there?  I hate the urgency.  Yeah, take us through the whole bowel movement.  Step by step.  Well, we've used this on the show many, many times.  It was kind of like riding a 10-speed bike through a mud puddle.  Oh.  Like, I think the back of my shirt's got some problems now.  It's just that urgency when you...  You can be driving home and... 
[00:16:30]  It's just splattered everywhere, dude.  I've never seen splatter that high up on a toilet bowl before.  Oh, that's funny, because when you walk to a public restroom and you just see that,  you're like, what kind of a piece of shit?  Now you're that guy.  No, no, the bowl's totally clean.  What animal?  How did it get there?  Yeah, you've got to take it to the next level.  You go into some of these stalls, and it's like on the wall and stuff.  You're like, what kind of animal would do that?  I'll tell you what was unbelievable.  The Boston Comedy Club.  Okay.  In the men's room.  Somebody sprayed the wall with some shit, and that was there, I swear to God, for at 
[00:17:00]  least three years.  Because no one will clean it.  Well, know what that's all...  At least three years.  You know what that's all about, by the way?  I think we figured it out.  Because you see it every once in a while.  That person has the green apple splatters.  You're bending down like this to get to the bowl.  You're not going to sit on the bowl.  Well, you're bending down to get on the bowl, but you don't laugh.  There's also the spin around.  The spin around where, like I was talking, the urgency. 
[00:17:30]  It builds up.  You're driving home.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Your garage door starts opening.  You're like, whoa.  Like your body knows you're close.  Same thing happens at the stall.  You run in.  Rip your pants down.  Now, between the time your pants are down, you're bending and turning to the toilet.  But you lighthouse that whole place.  Wow.  Lighthouse.  I love it.  It's on the wall.  And now what are you going to do?  You're not cleaning that up.  There are people for that.  Lighthouse.  That's really good. 
[00:18:00]  You leave it there and no one else is going to clean it.  It's like that dump that was at the parking garage that I talked about for the past year.  Some homeless guy dumped a log at the entrance to my parking garage.  And I looked at it every day for almost a year straight and just watched it decompose.  I could have taken a photo of it every day and had this wonderful time-lapse photography of a decomposing log.  It turned into what looked like cigar wrapping. 
[00:18:30]  Like it was almost paper in the shape of a canoe.  The shit fields.  It's like scientists examining.  This is what a shit looks like after two days.  I will know now what a dump can look like after, say, a month.  I'll know the state it should be in under certain conditions.  You know what's funny?  Human shit.  Every other kind of shit is hilarious.  Like you step in dog shit.  Somebody can throw horse shit at you and on some level you're going to laugh.  But human shit is the foulest. 
[00:19:00]  It's just no part of it.  Yeah.  It doesn't curl up nicely like a dog.  It's just a long, straight, disgusting thing or Lincoln log.  It's really disgusting.  It really is messy at this hour.  Why are we talking about this?  Because you know what dogs eat and it's like whatever.  It's such plain, boring food, right?  Yeah.  But human shit, all of a sudden you see like a chicken wing in it.  Oh, stop it.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, how did we get there?  Well, you had to bring it up.  It was just horse to eat that steel-coated oatmeal. 
[00:19:30]  Steel-cut.  Steel-cut.  Someone can explain steel-cut oatmeal for me, all right?  Thank goodness.  Let's go.  I just had to bring that to the table because I might have to run out of here at any given moment.  That's all.  That's all.  Right now we know.  All right.  Let's move on to Chris on Long Island.  Chris?  Fellas.  What's up, Chris?  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Bill?  Hello.  Awesome one-night stand.  Oh, thanks.  Unbelievable, man.  Yeah, Bill Burr getting rave reviews on his HBO comedy special that ran over the weekend.  It sounded like he was kind of going through puberty, though. 
[00:20:00]  He was cracking a bit.  He was sounding like Peter Brady a little bit.  It's how Bill's voice is when he gets excited on stage.  Very passionate about his material.  I haven't seen it yet.  I was waiting for it to be on demand, but I guess that takes, what, about a week or so?  No, it's on demand right now.  Oh, it wasn't on yesterday when I checked.  Watched it last night for the second time.  Ah, the holes in that lie, Opie.  Yeah, I know, right?  Where are you?  I was going to watch it.  I swear.  I'll have a full report tomorrow.  Yeah, I was going to do something. 
[00:20:30]  Watched it on demand right after it aired.  Yo, Anthony.  It's right there.  No, stop.  What else is Chris?  Lighthouse?  Lighthouse, the stall?  That's freaking great.  Isn't that great?  I've never heard of that one before.  All right, peace.  All right.  It can only happen on the spin.  Let's say hi to Don in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Don?  Hey, what's happening?  How are you, bro?  Oh, good.  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Bill, you are a funny motherfucker, man.  Oh, I was pissing myself.  Oh, thanks a lot, man.  My wife thought I was having a fucking seizure in bed. 
[00:21:00]  It was fucking hilarious.  Well, thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Oh, man.  Punch it out, boys.  Thanks.  All right, bro.  You're getting the people calling you going, this is the one, dude.  This is going to put you over the top.  No, I got more like emails.  Emails?  Yeah.  Yeah, my parents came down for it, and, you know, so that was cool.  And then, you know, my brothers don't give a shit.  They're like, they're how funny you are.  Oh, bastards.  Did you watch it with anybody?  No, I can't watch myself. 
[00:21:30]  No, really?  I can't.  I can't watch it.  You didn't even watch it?  No.  You didn't peek?  No.  So you don't sit there and watch myself for what happened.  Am I amazing?  Look at me.  Look at that shirt.  That really just hangs off and just shows the lines of my torso.  That's a comment.  You think of me, like, not like to laugh, but professionally.  I was on stage at the Mohegan Sun when that shit was coming on in front of, like, I don't  know, 42 people.  Really?  Yeah.  How weird is that? 
[00:22:00]  How weird is it?  Well, you know, you're on HBO.  So, who knows how many, hundreds of thousands of people checking that out, and you're, as  that's playing for the whole country, you're in front of 42 people.  Oh, yeah.  Doing the same material, probably.  No, no.  I try to, you know.  Change the whole accent set?  Yeah, yeah.  That's very cool.  Making sure I, I mean, if you see me do, like, 45 minutes to an hour, then I'm going to have  a couple of ones from that.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't want to have people, like, lip syncing my act.  Right, right.  You know?  Because even they do such, just like you said the other day about, like, Regan, they yell out the punchline. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, they ruin the whole thing.  And I had to tell a joke one time, and I realized it, like, halfway through it.  Like, he's like, do the pesto thing.  You know, the girlfriend yelling about the pesto.  Yeah.  And I'm like, you know, I did the, what am I, a jukebox thing and that shit.  And I'm like, all right, fuck it, I'll do it.  And I started to do it, and right as I was coming around the corner, thinking of the next line,  I'm like, fuck, he already said the punchline.  And I'm like, da-da-da-da-da-da, pesto, crickets.  And I'm like, you see? 
[00:23:00]  And I just flipped out, yelling at the dude, like, well, you don't do it.  Oh, that's very funny.  To get to the other side.  Do the chicken joke.  Why did the chicken cross off?  Oh, fuck.  To get to the other side, yeah.  But you didn't watch yourself.  No surprise.  Most people just hate watching themselves on TV.  But you don't know what they cut out.  You don't know what angles they used.  Well, one of the things that I made sure, like, whenever you tape one of those things,  they'll say, okay, say that one, like, they needed, like, 28 minutes. 
[00:23:30]  And they'll do, they'll say, do at least 35, no more than, say, 45.  You're the guy that does 29?  No, I do the least amount of time that they tell me.  That way you don't give them all this extra shit.  That's so smart.  To cut up.  Oh, yeah.  That is so smart.  See?  They don't know when, how to cut it in.  Anthony and I are more educated now, but when we went on Bill O'Reilly, there was a tape  piece, which was so stupid.  This was after, I don't know, months of pretty much telling them no, and we finally, they 
[00:24:00]  finally got to us and we're like, all right.  Because I think they finally said, come on, guys, it'll be fun.  Yeah.  I think that's what finally got us to.  And we love fun, so.  Yeah, Bill O'Reilly and fun, of course.  We gotta be there.  Bill's a huge fan of the show.  Oh, he's gotta be.  Oh, yeah.  We heard all that bullshit.  They actually did say that.  Bill's a fan, you know, he has different opinions, but he's a fan and, all right, what's the piece  going to be called?  Well, you guys will be involved, just one interview piece, there'll be many with other people,  and it's The Corruption of the American Youth. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that'll work out well.  We didn't know at the time.  No, of course we didn't.  We didn't know that that's what the title was going to be.  The Corruption of the American Youth.  That's what it ended up being, but I think they said, ah, he's doing a little thing on  pop culture, you know.  That person must every night go to bed just complaining, like, I lie for a living.  That's what I do.  Every day, I entrap people.  I think she's too distracted with the fact that she only has one arm.  Oh, we didn't even know.  We call her the slot machine now.  She had bigger problems at the time. 
[00:25:00]  She had one arm.  Put everything into perspective?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Did you mention slot machine?  Yeah, slot machine.  Slot machine, yeah.  She was the one.  We'd never know.  Here's how great we are.  Here's how great we'd be at being a witness.  We didn't know she had a whole fake arm.  Her arm was fake.  The hand, well, obviously, her arm was fake.  The hand can't just pop a real hand.  It was a mannequin arm with, like, a bracelet on it.  Yeah.  And the fingers didn't move.  We didn't notice, and I can't even tell you for how long we didn't notice, and I thought 
[00:25:30]  I was bad, but you saw her in a bathtub.  Naked.  Naked.  And didn't notice she had a fake arm.  Well, Ben was part of that.  Yeah, I didn't notice her.  How do you not notice a naked girl with a fake arm?  She was one of the producers for Bill O'Reilly, so she was coming around and doing meetings  with us in a big conference room, and she's even...  And she'll remain nameless so we don't get her in trouble.  Right.  I forgot her name.  The one-armed lady.  I don't stake her with the other one-armed people at work at O'Reilly.  I really did forget her name, but she came by. 
[00:26:00]  We were having meetings, you know.  Stephanie.  Stephanie, right.  Named Stephanie?  Bill, she was hanging out in the studio.  I mean, she was around the station off and on for a while, right?  Because she was trying to gain our trust.  Right.  That's what it was.  That's why she was snapping pictures of her snatch underneath the desk with the camera  and then putting it back in Opie's drawer.  No, she was just a mess in general.  And getting in beer fights with us at the Hooters.  Right, at Hooters.  She, and Bill, she had a little thing for me, but I just wasn't attracted to her whatsoever. 
[00:26:30]  So you get this girl naked?  No, no, no.  The story gets really weird.  So I was down hanging out with Ben one night.  I guess we were in the East Village, right?  Yeah, we were in the East Village.  We were in the East Village having a few beers, and she was there or in that area.  We ran into her or we met her for a drink.  I don't even know exactly.  It was the whole time when we were all getting together to do this interview, so we kind of  knew her.  She was, like, hanging around a lot.  So I guess we met her for a drink or whatever, and then she invites us back to her pad, and  we walk in, and Pink Floyd music is cranking, and her roommates are just getting fucked up 
[00:27:00]  stoned, man.  Like, they were just out of their minds with lava lamps.  The whole deal, man.  Black lights.  They were just having a grand old time.  Sounds like boogie nights.  So she goes, some one-armed whore.  Now, dude, dude, where?  Is anybody on roller skates just going around the apartment?  We're in the bar, and she was a smoker.  This is when you can still smoke in the bars.  So this goes back a little bit.  She was lighting her cigarettes and everything at the bar and drinking. 
[00:27:30]  Still don't notice the arm.  She was at the station off and on for a couple weeks.  Didn't notice the one arm.  If it was windy in there when she went to light the cigarette, I think you would have noticed.  She went to do that cover thing.  We go back to her pad.  The stump.  We go back to her pad.  Her roommates are getting high and stuff.  So she's like, hey, you guys want to go to the roof and have another beer?  So it's me, Ben, and her on the roof drinking and stuff, right?  No big deal.  Checking out the street below, whatever. 
[00:28:00]  Ben's like, I got to go.  So he leaves, and I'm still hanging.  For what reason, I truly don't know.  Because there was no attraction there.  But I hung out.  Then YMCA came on the radio.  So I have another beer with her up on the roof.  And we go back into her apartment.  And her friends are still off getting high or whatever.  And all of a sudden, she goes into the bathroom.  And I'm sitting out there like, what the hell is going on?  And all of a sudden, like one of these dumb movies, she calls in the bathroom. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, Opie, or whatever.  I'm like, oh, Jesus, what's up?  And the door was slightly open, right?  So I opened the door, right?  She had, I don't know how she did this all within, it seemed only like five minutes.  But she's in the bathtub, completely naked, candles lit.  And I look at her.  So she's waiting for some company.  I look at her in the bathtub, and I just start laughing.  I'm laughing, like, you've got to be kidding me.  You know, because she's like the producer of Bill O'Reilly and stuff, and she's trying to get us on the show. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, that's why you're laughing at this point.  Yeah.  Just the whole thing.  Just like, what?  You know?  Right, right, right.  Because I didn't give her any indication that I was interested in this at all.  You were at her house.  Yeah, I guess.  But we were coming and going and stuff.  Ben was there, too.  Were you in the bathroom?  I walked in, because she called me.  Oh, she called you into the bathroom.  So I'm like, you know what?  I can't do this.  I just can't.  I started laughing like an idiot.  And I leave.  And she was hammered, because she really...  There's three years of therapy right there.  Oh, yeah.  And I just put myself out there like that. 
[00:29:30]  She completely...  That's the funny part.  She definitely put herself out there.  And I just take off.  I'm laughing like an idiot.  And she's hammered.  And I'm going down the stairs.  At this point, she followed me.  She was able to get a towel on.  She's sitting at the top of the stairs.  And I'm seeing snatch and everything, because she's at the top of the stairs.  And I'm below the stairs.  And she's just screaming at me, you fucking bastard.  All pissed off that I didn't go for it.  And I'm laughing even harder. 
[00:30:00]  I leave the apartment.  I call Ben right away.  We're laughing our balls off, okay?  But the only reason I bring up this story is, still don't notice she only has one arm.  So maybe that's why she was so pissed that I rejected her.  Naked in the tub.  How do you not see that?  Maybe she's thinking, look, it took a lot for me.  Inspector Ophity.  Oh, yeah.  I think that's a good place to start.  Maybe she was...  Maybe the first thing that she thought was that she was missing an arm.  And maybe that's why I didn't want her.  But it probably took a lot for her, thinking, well, you know, he's got to see me how I am, you know? 
[00:30:30]  So she was probably...  It took her a lot.  And she was brave.  And I rejected her.  She put herself out there all at once.  I completely rejected her.  And she just fucking was screaming at me.  And I didn't understand at the time why she was so pissed off.  I'm like, whatever, you know?  That's all at once, dude.  That isn't even...  Hi, I'd like to tell you I have a fake arm.  Right.  And now I want you to see me naked.  That's like all at the same time.  Naked, the arm, everything out there.  Right.  Here it is.  Right. 
[00:31:00]  So, Ben's got to get back in here for this.  So then we decide we were going to have a magazine signing party at Hooters because we just got syndicated.  So every magazine was doing an article on us.  I can't believe that was after the bathtub incident.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Yeah, no, it was.  And another thing.  I can't believe you never fucking even told me about that bathtub thing.  I never heard of that.  I can't believe you had a magazine signing at Hooters.  You know what I mean?  Out of all...  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Let's go to an Applebee's.  There's so many awful chains that are less awful than that.  That place is so fucking...  Sex and food, I just never got it.  And it's like...  It isn't even good sex and food.  Yeah.  Just like the uniforms they wear are horrid.  If they...  Yeah, if they would upgrade the uniforms, then they might be on to something.  That 1970s roller boogie shorts they're wearing.  Oh, and those tights.  Those supposed to look like skin color and their...  Yeah, I have varicose veins tights.  They show more skin at McDonald's is what it comes down to because it's fake skin. 
[00:32:00]  You know, what those leotards are just, you know, skin color.  They're not showing real skin.  They had something on thesmokinggun.com.  I guess they got a hold of their contract that they have to sign at Hooters, the waitresses,  and there's a whole dress code, and they're very strict.  No midriff is to show at all.  They're supposed to tuck in their shirts into those bad shorts.  The shorts have to be approved by them.  It's the color and the length.  The stockings have to be that color unless your skin color is darker, and then you can 
[00:32:30]  go one shade darker.  No exposed tattoos.  It was just a very strict uniform code.  Manifesto.  And it's the most unsexy thing ever.  But they're still flourishing.  And you're not allowed to wear the uniform outside the place.  When they leave, they have to cover up with some type of jacket, and until they come in  and are ready for their shift, they have to wear a coat or something until they go in the  back and they're shifted.  They're ready.  Don't be a whore until you punch in. 
[00:33:00]  They, yeah, don't, no whoring until you punch in.  And it actually said, remember, this is show business in the contract.  They're in show business.  So at least we're up another rung here on the radio.  We were broadcasting above Hooters.  I'm in show business.  Oh, yeah.  What are you doing?  You're an actor?  Yeah, I work at Hooters.  Hooters.  It was easy to throw a party down there because we were right upstairs, and we had all these  magazines that came out.  So we're like, why don't we just throw a little party together at Hooters?  We'll sign some magazines and we'll get the hell out of there. 
[00:33:30]  Plus, Bill O'Reilly, they were looking for some video of us hanging out with our fans.  Because at this point, we said, all right, we'll do the piece.  So the thing was, too, the other thing was, what was it, Penthouse?  Because the manager at Hooters was trying to tell me there was a family restaurant and  he didn't want us signing Penthouse magazine there.  That was the best part.  It's a family restaurant, Hooters.  Yeah, they were pissed off at our language sometimes.  I'm sorry.  They're doing a story on racy t-shirts. 
[00:34:00]  I guess they're selling them in...  San Gennaro.  San Gennaro.  Down there in Little Italy here in New York.  It supports single moms.  It's a silhouette of a stripper on a pole.  And there were ones for kids, too.  Right.  My parents shake me like that one.  Wow, they can't even show those.  They've cubed them out.  Well, the problem is, I guess they're selling these t-shirts too close to a church.  Is it a church?  Calm down.  Is that the problem?  Calm down.  Sometimes you see kids wearing things like little kids with juicy written on their asses. 
[00:34:30]  He loves the cock.  They had to take the O and the C out of it.  Why do we know what that one was?  He loves the cock with an arrow.  So when you walk next to him, the guy next to you loves the cock.  I've got to have that shirt.  Oh, wow.  That's a funny one.  So, I like that one.  Those things are so pathetic. 
[00:35:00]  I know.  How long is it funny for?  You didn't even write it.  Is this supposed to let me in on your personality?  Oh, look how wacky I am.  Party's beginning now.  This guy is just labeled raunchy t-shirt fan.  It's just so stupid.  It's funny.  I wear one.  I get looks all the time.  It says, wait, you say potato, and then it says, and I say, fuck you.  Right.  You know, I saw you wearing that the other day, and I was like, is he making fun of people who wears t-shirts like that? 
[00:35:30]  Nope, he's a funny guy.  It just makes me laugh because, you know, I mispronounce stuff on the show, so it's perfect for me, and someone sent it in, so I was obliged to wear it, and I like it.  Anyway, getting back to the story.  He's got a little testy there.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Not at all.  Okay.  So, Red Hooters, where's Ben?  This is the grand finale of the slot machine story.  I know.  This is coming like Lord of the Rings here.  So, I know, Ant and I are in the front of the room with Jimmy. 
[00:36:00]  We're signing, you know, autographs and having a grand old time, and Bill O'Reilly's cameras are, you know, flowing and getting some interaction between us and the fans.  And all of a sudden, I think it was Ben.  That's why I want him in here.  Where's Ben?  He just ran out again.  Oh, he can't sit still.  His beloved Pat's lost over the weekend, so he's not happy.  Ha-ha.  Ben.  Ben.  All right.  What happened to the Pats this weekend? 
[00:36:30]  Bad game.  A lot of penalties.  Brady had an off game.  It happens.  Hey, the whole division's one-on-one now, so I don't want to give a shit.  Ben, it's okay.  Yeah.  What happened?  How many games did they go last season?  They won a long time.  Without a loss.  They won until the Miami game.  Quite a while, right?  He threw a lot of bad passes and tons of penalties.  And fumbles.  They looked awful, actually.  What happened?  My Jets looked much better than yesterday.  You see Philadelphia just romped San Francisco?  But what an asshole Terrell Owens is at the end. 
[00:37:00]  He scores a touchdown.  He's in his old team's stadium.  Just a shit-up.  Does his little dance.  He stares at the crowd.  He's just an asshole.  Anyway, we're getting to the grand finale of this dumb story.  I don't even know why we went there.  So we're at Hooters doing the magazine signing.  And the beer is flowing.  We end up having a massive beer fight at the end of the thing, by the way.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, Ben...  I think it was you, right?  Well, Norton had... 
[00:37:30]  Norton spotted it.  Yeah, Norton spotted it.  But he wasn't the one who told me.  I look off to Ben, who's on the side, you know, keeping an eye on everything.  And he goes like this.  He starts hitting his, like, left arm.  And he goes like, pointing, like, over to where Stephanie is, who's checking us out with  her notepad, making notes for Bill O'Reilly and stuff, right?  So I turn in the middle of the thing, and that's when I finally saw that she had a mannequin  arm with a bracelet on it.  So then I told Anthony, and we all were completely freaked. 
[00:38:00]  That's how it went.  Right?  Yeah.  And at that point, we were completely freaked out because we were hanging out with this girl  off and on for a couple weeks leading up to this event.  I just like how Norton figured it out in two seconds.  Like, I think it was the first time Norton even saw her, and he figured it out like that.  But the point is, we would make horrendous words.  How soon before he said something inappropriate?  He told everybody, and Voss was there, Voss was dying.  Norton was probably just trying to figure out how she could jerk him off and play with 
[00:38:30]  his nipples at the same time.  Looked at her hands, because that factors in.  Like, I'm sure it was just some perverse thing.  Is that, uh, oh yeah, there she is.  There she is right there.  Some old pictures that Eric just found.  She doesn't even work there anymore.  I remember, though, when everything went down, she was calling people, trying to get interviews.  Remember Rick was trying to get on Bill O'Reilly?  Remember that whole saga?  Yeah.  Well.  So, there you have it.  We make horrendous witnesses.  Oh, there's the picture of her panties. 
[00:39:00]  With the string.  Under the desk with the tampon string.  Yeah, she just wouldn't give up.  Like, I had this camera, a disposable camera in my desk.  And, uh, you know, the after-hour parties at the office got insane.  I think Stinky finally hooked up with her for a while.  Yeah, Stinky was back there at your desk.  Like, God knows what's happening up there.  So, I think if you're missing an arm, you've got to be a little, you know, tenacious.  Well, a tad.  She took my camera one day while these guys were partying after hours.  I didn't know this until I developed the pictures.  Swear to God.  And she's taking pictures of her snatch, like, because she was wearing a skirt. 
[00:39:30]  Good for her.  And we, uh, I developed the pictures, and sure enough, she was having her friend.  And there's strings hanging out.  No picture of the arm there, Hawk?  I notice every single picture, it's her right hand.  She knew how to hide the thing.  And her left hand is the one that, uh...  She just knew how to kind of keep it out of, uh, out of view.  Yeah.  Sort of like radar on MASH.  Where's, like, a ski parker in July?  Oh, oh.  There it is, the wrist. 
[00:40:00]  But you can't tell.  You can see, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can see through that shirt, dude.  That's one of those pictures where she, her black shirt, you can see through, and you  can see where the link-up is.  Isn't that a piece of metal in there or something?  What is that?  I guess.  What is that?  I guess.  And look at her elbow.  It's bionic.  I guess we should have noticed that.  How did we not see that?  Oh, we blind.  Safe to say, I was probably drunk, but what about the rest of you guys?  I don't know.  And then there was a massive beer fight, and... 
[00:40:30]  And people were writing with markers on her leg, like, there was arrows all over her  leg, like, pointing up her, you know, to her snatch.  Yeah, that's, uh...  Wow.  How was the bathtub?  Was it one of those four-cloth feet bathtubs?  It was, like...  Sloshing around.  Hello, Opie.  It was candlelit.  So...  A bunch of candles.  I can't believe you laughed, though.  I know.  You know, I had a girl one time, right?  She wanted to do this role-play thing, right?  She wanted me to come over there, and she'd answer the door with nothing on but a towel 
[00:41:00]  and, like, high heels.  But you know what's going into it?  That's what...  I think she...  No, I didn't.  Oh, okay.  She brought it up one time that she wanted to do it, right?  Okay.  So, we can go around with this girl for like a month.  So, we have this big fucking fight on the phone, right?  And I'm going over there, and I already don't want to be with this girl anymore.  I'm thinking, what the fuck am I doing with this girl, right?  Why am I going over here?  So, I go over there, all ready for this fight, right?  I knock on her apartment door.  She opens the door, and it's pitch black in there.  I'm like, what the fuck, right?  And she opens the door, and there she is standing in nothing but a towel and these high-heeled shoes. 
[00:41:30]  But the thing was, the high-heeled shoes were not sexy.  Oh, no.  They were like a fucking, like, a sensible shoe.  Like, the kind of shoe you wear to, like, a job interview, like, covers the whole foot.  And the heel was about an eighth of an inch.  Dude, she looked fucking ridiculous.  And she's standing there like, huh?  You want some of this?  Which made it even more hilarious.  And she told me she was a jazz fan a few years, a few, you know, weeks earlier. 
[00:42:00]  So, I bought her, like, this John Coltrane CD.  Because I didn't know anything about it.  I love Supreme.  So, she had that on in the background.  And it's like that.  Kind of fucking music.  And she's standing there.  And, dude, I am, like, chomping on the inside of my mouth.  And I'm just like, if I laugh at this girl right now, I ruin her for the next fucking guy.  She's going to be in therapy for fucking 12 years.  So, my dick is just like, dude, I'm out.  It's like laying on my leg.  Like, you're on your own, right?  So, I had to play it like I was laughing. 
[00:42:30]  Like, oh, wow.  I wasn't ready for this shit.  And I got her in the living room.  And the first thing I did was I got that fucking music off.  And I was sitting next to her.  And I was starting to, okay, she's got the towel.  And she looks good.  And then she crossed her fucking legs.  And that damn shoe was in my vision again.  I was just like, I finally, I finally, I came up.  I somehow got her out of the shoes.  And, dude, I just conjured up every clip of the most heinous fucking porno I had ever seen 
[00:43:00]  to fucking somehow get my dick back in the game.  It was horrific.  Wow.  It was horrific.  That is bad.  Sensible shoes.  That's really funny.  I didn't laugh.  No.  I hope she doesn't have fucking exes.  I just had to just openly laugh because it was just how silly the whole thing was.  Oh, you would have crushed her.  Yeah.  When my marriage was, like, done and I was just waiting for, you know, for the right  opportunity, I mean, everything, as far as I was concerned, there was just no love left, 
[00:43:30]  nothing.  And I'd drive home and my biggest thrill was just to get in and get on that computer and  play video games and that's it.  Don't bother me.  That was it.  And I'd pull up to the house and I'd see, like, candles lit inside.  Like, it looked like a horror movie.  It was just candles lit everywhere because I could see the front doors open, the window  shades are up and stuff.  And it was winter or something. 
[00:44:00]  I'm not even sure, but it was getting dark.  So, well, by the time we got home, it was getting dark.  You were hoping that she converted to Judaism or some type of religion that takes a lot of  candles.  I don't know.  And then I'd pull up and just see, like, a house full of candles and I knew, like, she  wanted a romantic evening.  And romance was, there was nothing.  I felt nothing for this woman.  And sometimes I would just pull away and go to the bar down the street.  Wow. 
[00:44:30]  I would just look and keep going and go to New York Avenue.  And just pound a few down, watch the ball game.  I'm going to be late tonight.  Hope there's come back and the place had burned down.  The candles burned all the way down to the end of the wick.  Hopefully she's been drunk, full of sleep, and the place had burned.  Wow.  What a horrible feeling that must have had.  Oh, it was just like, I'd pull up and go, I want no part of this. 
[00:45:00]  I want nothing to do with this.  And just pull away.  Was that a last-ditch effort, you think?  Who knows?  Yeah.  Who knows?  Maybe it was.  Probably read an article in, like, Cosmo.  Right, exactly.  Because that's what it looks like.  It excites your man.  The second you're walking in, guys, and you see rose petals leading up to the bedroom,  she didn't come up with the idea, you know?  It's something she read in, yeah, Cosmo.  I saw it on the Oxygen Network, and it's so hokey. 
[00:45:30]  I hate the hokey stuff.  Rose petals all over the bed.  Great.  I need that stuck to my bag the next day at work.  I'm going to take a leak.  What the fuck?  I got cancer.  Oh, it's a rose petal.  Fuck you.  What a great way to start the show.  All right.  What are we doing here?  I don't know.  We're crawling out of that 20-minute shit story that we started with.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry.  Let's go to PA.  Hey, Fulton, what's up? 
[00:46:00]  Yo, guys.  We're talking about football earlier.  You notice how the holes are ruining the games?  The sideline reporters and stuff, right?  Oh, they're horrible.  I'm telling you, I think the listeners need to start capturing clips of the holes talking  because what they say is just will not necessarily drive you crazy if you really listen to it.  You know what?  That's not a bad idea.  That's a great idea for a bit.  Thanks.  Hey, you mind if I tell a funny shit story?  I think you guys will like it.  Oh, boy.  We were just crawling out, weren't we?  Yeah, we're trying to move on, but go ahead.  This is a good one. 
[00:46:30]  One time, me and my friends, we were driving down the street, and out of the corner of  my eye, I seen a purse on the side of the street.  He busts a U-turn real quick and got out and grabbed the purse thinking, I'm finding  some money or something, get back in the car, open the purse, and there's a big pile of  shit inside of it.  That's funny.  Hey, do you think that somebody shit in the purse because they had a shit that bad, or  did they shit in the purse thinking some sucker like me is going to come around and pick  it up and check it out?  I think it was a gag right from the get-go.  I fell for it.  Why are you going to shit in a purse?  Like, that's probably the 15th place you'd shit if you really had to shit badly. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, that's like an old practical joke.  Yeah.  My buddy Scotty had to take a dump so bad on the guy in the State Parkway that he shit  in his sweatshirt and threw it out the window.  He had IBS.  Right.  Durable bowel syndrome?  Durable bowel syndrome.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Thank you.  That happened in the Mighty Ducks?  Is that what, the purse story? 
[00:47:30]  So either he's lying or his friend ripped it off, hoo-hoo, from the movie.  All right.  He should have closed with the first shit joke.  Yeah, I know.  That worked for him, and then he just went on.  They never know when to stop.  It was very strong.  All right.  And now we have to take a break, because he just ruined everything.  We had a great energy going.  God damn it.  And now we have to do what we like to call a regroup.  You son of a bitch.  Oh, eBay items going away in less than an hour, huh?  What?  We got our Opie and Anthony auction for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  We'll get into that whole thing when we get back, okay? 
[00:48:00]  That's where we started, and then it just went horribly wrong today.  Certainly did.  Well, I made the toilet bowl look like downtown New Orleans.  I'll tell you that much.  No, we don't need to do that.  Hey, now.  I know.  Thank you.  I'll be here all weekend.  Try the deal.  Hey, the Opie and Anthony auction, the second phase.  A lot of items are going away today.  Actually, a lot of items are going away in the next 15 or 20 minutes or so, so you might  want to go to the link that's on opianthony.com and see what's going away, maybe get a final 
[00:48:30]  bid on some of this stuff.  What's an Opie and Anthony HES promotional sign autographed?  Those are the signs from your appearance at the Home Electronics Show here in New York.  The big, tall ones autographed.  All right.  Those are going away in like 11 minutes, 10 minutes.  The Opie and Anthony Mardi Gras banner that we autographed, that's going away in like 10 minutes.  Oh, Martini Steve American flame shirt's going away in 10 minutes, Anthony.  Wow, that's a big item.  Make a final bid on that.  Another flame shirt going away in about 10 minutes.  In a half hour, a lot of Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez photo sets autographed are going away in about a half hour. 
[00:49:00]  What else in the next hour?  Jim Norton's Scarface shirt that he got for his birthday.  From his mother, I guess.  Right.  Gave him this for his birthday and he comes in and just complains about how it stinks.  Isn't that odd?  His mother got him a present and he did nothing but complain about it.  How can a Scarface t-shirt stink?  Because it was such a bright red. 
[00:49:30]  The shirt was red and it had like a white print of Pacino on the front and it said Scarface on the back.  He goes, it was just the worst shirt.  It's awful.  And he wore it here one day.  He wore it to show how bad it was and it really was just a bad, bad shirt.  But I am so bad.  When I get a present for Christmas or birthday or something, I can't even confess to myself I don't like it.  Because it makes me feel bad for the person.  I start picturing them actually buying it and thinking it's going to be good or something. 
[00:50:00]  So the worst is they're sitting there staring at you.  Yeah.  Because you're opening it like that.  You like that?  Good one.  And I can't even admit it to myself.  So I convince myself that I like it.  They're looking for your reaction.  And as soon as they're looking for your reaction, they even know that the gift stinks.  Yeah.  That's what that comes down to.  Cash is king.  That's right.  But the Jim Norton Scarface bright red shirt, it's just awful that he autographed.  That's going away in like 40 minutes.  My pants that I gave to Travis, don't ask Bill, they're going away in about 40 minutes. 
[00:50:30]  Even the intern for a day is going away?  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony intern for a day.  If you want to make a final bid on that, that's going away in less than an hour.  And it goes on and on.  Wow stickers.  Brian Regan's Cup of Dirt has less than an hour left in auction.  What's that up to?  $430 for a Cup of Dirt autographed by Brian Regan.  Brian Regan's Pop-Tart City autograph, that's going away in the next hour.  So a lot of items.  And obviously it's for a good cause.  100% of the proceeds go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
[00:51:00]  The link's on opieandanthony.com to get to the auction.  We're helping.  We certainly are.  You know, Jeremy caught me on a few things here.  Go ahead, Jeremy.  How are you doing this morning?  You're getting away with murder with that Jim there.  I've been listening for only 15 minutes this morning, and you've thrown out the grand religion of Judaism.  I know.  Judaism.  I can't believe no one picked that.  Irritable bowel syndrome.  What is it?  Irritable.  Irritable.  Oh, irritable, right.  You're right. 
[00:51:30]  Keep me honest, man.  Keep me honest.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  It just goes to show how I don't listen.  I just don't listen.  I'm constantly waiting for the next bit of hilarity to come out of my own mouth.  I don't listen to people.  What did you say?  I'm just a moron.  Yeah, what?  And you're just a moron.  I'm just still replaying what he said, like, irritable?  What?  Irritating?  All right, so good start to the program here.  Yes.  Romantic moments that went horribly wrong. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe we'll take a few of those calls today.  We'll get into the Hurricane Katrina.  Trying to think of another one.  I do have another one, yeah.  You want to bring it to the table after the break?  Yeah, because it's real old.  It's like high school time.  Okay.  We'll do that next.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Lee, I want you to be very honest.  Yes.  I'm going to put you on the spot here.  How annoying was Jim Norton, as far as the Robert Plant picture goes? 
[00:52:30]  Don't hold back.  Because I guarantee you...  You know, with respect to his tenacity in acquiring a photograph, it was unbelievable.  I've never seen anything like it.  Probably, well, it was back in the late 60s.  Someone really, really wanted to meet Hendrix.  I think it was 67.  That's comparable, right?  That was comparable.  But since then, nothing like Jimmy trying to get the picture of a plant.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  The vicious tenacity, the intensity. 
[00:53:00]  That sounds better than just calling him a nudge.  I was a nudge.  I'll admit that.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  But the photo is scary.  You've seen it.  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's classic.  I've got it on my trio right now.  The little smiling faces.  His little lock over my face.  Yeah, the hair is touching your face.  The little men just smiling.  His head is as big as a pumpkin.  It really is awful.  I've never seen a bigger head in my life.  But you have to do it that way to get Robert Plant.  You have to do it that way.  He even said he's a tough one.  His people are very protective. 
[00:53:30]  He's a very tough one to get.  You have to...  Well, Lee's a very important man, and he had a lot to do that day, and you didn't care.  I would just hop in and ask him.  You didn't care about everything else he needed to take care of that day.  I do want you to know, just went in there and said, look, you know, I know we've got  a performance here, and this is a big deal.  Robert's, you know, a rock god.  We've got to do this Norton thing.  Or the deal's off.  Or the deal is off.  We came so close to the whole show being scrubbed.  A very upset Robert Plant leaving his band, sulking, moving away, management and label  freaking out because of Norton, so at the last minute, Robert said, well, we've got 
[00:54:00]  to do that.  And he agreed.  And the picture was taken.  Yes, it was great.  And I understand Paul McCartney is stopping in at one point, possibly.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  We're talking to the McCartney people, and one of the conditions is a photo with you.  Right.  It's interesting.  You bet I'll be there for that one.  Okay, you know, that's actually critical to any...  All the artists are coming to us now that we're big and popular and getting bigger all  the time.  And it's interesting how the Norton factor is a key ingredient in all the conditions. 
[00:54:30]  No, boy.  I hear Jimmy is demanding that they find a crosswalk to take the McCartney picture.  Is that true?  And you're making him take his shoes off.  And he said he would do it for you.  I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but Paul, take your shoes off.  Walk with me onto this crosswalk.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  As a matter of fact, I understand they might watch on the cover of the next Plant Record.  Oh.  Be happy to be a part of that.  Nude crawling on rocks. 
[00:55:00]  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Boom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bill Byrne's studio today.  It's the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:55:30]  The ONA virus.  Spread the virus for us, please.  Help us out here.  The show's growing by leaps and bounds at this point.  Yeah.  You know, we've been at this almost a year already, Anthony.  I thought it was over a year.  What the hell time is it?  I'm talking about the first time we actually did a show.  Yeah.  We've been with XM for well over a year now, but we had to wait out a stupid no-compete.  Remember when we were employed by XM but not doing the show yet?  So they had to justify paying us by making us attend meetings. 
[00:56:00]  Excuse me.  Outings and...  You've got to pay closer attention.  Yes.  They didn't start paying us until we started doing the radio show.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck.  They started paying us October 1st.  So they threw us a bone.  They gave us two days where we were getting paid for not working.  Wow.  I really thought we were being paid.  Oh, that whole promotional tour?  We didn't get paid.  And by that point, we weren't being paid by infinity either.  Right.  I was unemployed. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Check this out.  I should have applied for benefits.  Bill, we screw up, right?  We have to sit out two years, right?  And then after that, our contract with the old company officially ended.  Then we had to sit out what's called a no-compete for four months, even though we weren't competing  for two years before that.  Yeah, that's great.  Can you believe that?  Yeah, that's right.  They stopped paying us in June of last year.  Yeah.  Infinity.  So we had to go June and July and August and September without getting a paycheck. 
[00:57:00]  Wow, that was hard.  I remember those were tough times.  I was raking leaves.  I was doing some landscaping on the side just to make ends meet.  I went back to caddying.  You went back to caddying?  I remember you came down the cellar.  I hope you came down the cellar one night and he was just, you know, reading books and  working out and not eating.  Yeah.  That was my life.  I read...  It's the rain, man.  You would think that it would show on this program that I read a lot of books, but the  first break I already mispronounced half the words I used. 
[00:57:30]  I actually read close to 200 books in my time off.  Jesus Christ.  200.  Did you go for the hacky war and peace just to do it?  Just because it's long and you had time?  I did like Kill a Mockingbird and a classic.  What is war and peace about?  What time period?  War and some peace.  I don't know.  That would be war and peace.  Wow.  You know something?  I have no idea what the time period is.  Civil war, maybe?  Is it civil?  Is it French? 
[00:58:00]  Is it World War I?  Yeah, it's long.  I'm going to say, just guessing, I'm going to say World War I.  All right.  I'll say World War II.  I'll say the Civil War.  Civil War.  I was going to go with the Korean conflict.  I'm going to say Civil War.  All right.  Hey, that t-shirt story, we got the audio in.  Really?  Yeah, San Gennaro is the Italian feast that's happened here in New York for what?  All this week, I guess? 
[00:58:30]  Uh-huh.  Through the weekend, at least?  I don't know.  And they're selling the goofy, wacky t-shirts, and it's too close to a church or something,  so now it's a big story, so of course the news team had to get down to Little Italy to  get to the bottom of this whole thing.  And here's the audio.  It's a festival known for family, fun, and of course, hot food.  But at San Gennaro, some visitors are sizzling mad.  It seems like a few t-shirt vendors are peddling some pretty raunchy merchandise.  Considering the fact that this is a religious festival, I think it's not nice at all to 
[00:59:00]  have t-shirts like that.  The gaudy garments are meant to make you chuckle, but to some, they're no laughing matter.  It's not appropriate.  It shouldn't be at the feast, but morals have dropped.  The slogans range from mildly suggestive to downright dirty.  In fact, we can't really show you what this one says, but maybe the vendor can describe  it.  Maybe, maybe.  Oh, no, I can't describe it.  It's not for kids.  Festival organizers say they've asked the vendors to cover up.  Anything on a swear word, or we just cover it up, the middle part, just get rid of it? 
[00:59:30]  This does not say cook, and festival organizers say duct tape is not what they had in mind.  The notice they sent to vendors reads, we advise all novelty stands that under no circumstances  are you allowed to sell any pornographic items in this feast.  If we find any on your stands, our marshals have been instructed to close you down.  If you're preaching the word of God, then you're against God when you're using that kind  of shirt.  Still, not everyone is offended by these tasteless tees. 
[01:00:00]  In fact, this guy wanted to buy one right out of our hands.  I think it's lovely, man.  I would wear that shirt in a heartbeat.  How much you want?  $10, $15 for it or what?  Some of it is offensive, and I wouldn't like my daughters to see it, but it's, again, it's  New York, so you have to let things slide.  It's opinion.  Whatever you want to buy, you buy.  But this is the way to go.  Right here.  Oh, God.  Another non-story by the news.  This does not say cook.  It said cook. 
[01:00:30]  Napoleonic Wars, by the way.  I like that lady with just the moronic connection.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't it a thing for God?  If you have a t-shirt like that, then you're against God.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I'm saying with my shirt.  When I was printing those up, that's exactly what I was thinking.  I'm against God.  None of us win.  Why would you be against God?  Against God?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm against him.  Satan worshiper?  Yeah.  Just without a t-shirt. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  I'm sorry.  We're all idiots, by the way.  It was Napoleonic Wars.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  The French.  All right.  We could, like, hang up on everyone that has the answer.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  We got it.  We got the answer.  Thank you.  So, everybody that's on hold, please hang up on yourselves.  I get one point for the right century.  Yeah, you do.  Hurricane Katrina.  Yes.  It's still happening down there in New Orleans, I guess, huh?  Yes.  And I told Anthony, I said, mark my words, or word, mark my words, Hurricane Rita is going 
[01:01:30]  to hit New Orleans.  Yeah.  It's just how things work sometimes.  It has to happen.  That's the way the movie would work.  It has to happen.  You've heard about Hurricane Rita, right?  No.  It's heading toward the Keys, and it's going to skip off Key West, and it's going to turn  right into New Orleans.  You mark my word.  It's going into the Gulf.  It's just one of those things.  Every once in a while, something happens.  I don't know.  The stars line up, and something that is just, you know, the odds are not in its favor. 
[01:02:00]  It ends up happening.  Well, the moronic mayor over there is, much to the chagrin of a lot of the feds, is inviting  people back.  Inviting certain parishes back, business owners, and just general population.  Inviting them back to certain areas to get some normalcy, to start the rebuilding process.  But a lot of these places still don't have power, water.  They still have sewage on the ground, if not, you know, still flooded. 
[01:02:30]  So, a lot of these feds are saying, slow down.  You know, this is a stupid idea.  And bringing them back, now with it's still being hurricane season, and with one inching  into the Gulf like this, it really sounds like a bad idea.  Like, you don't want people coming back in just so you've got to chase them back out again  if this thing does happen to head toward New Orleans.  So, this mayor in New Orleans is really an idiot. 
[01:03:00]  Idiot.  And most of the people don't want to move back there anyway.  They're in better neighborhoods now.  Yeah, a lot of them don't want to move back.  It's a whole big thing.  Get them a kayak.  Right through the wall.  I was thinking about that clip all weekend long, Celine Dion.  Let them touch things.  Let them touch things.  The photoshops that turned up on Wackbag were just hysterical.  They got the photoshop threads going. 
[01:03:30]  And a lot of these now are turning into the animated photoshops.  I guess a lot of people are picking up that software.  I still got to figure that out.  Oh, my God.  Have you seen the dude on Wackbag who has the ultimate fighter who goes to kick that  guy in the leg and he breaks the wall?  That is the most heinous thing I ever saw.  I couldn't even read his message.  Yeah, he's got it.  It's something that I have.  One of the boxers.  What is this that we're looking at, Hawk?  Just missed the assault on the media.  Oh, the assault on the media happened?  Yeah.  How did we miss it?  How do we know it happened then?  Huh?  We got it on tape.  We got it on tape. 
[01:04:00]  What happened?  We might have had our own assault on the media today here in New York City.  I was watching that stupid channel the whole morning waiting for it and they changed the  channel on me.  Yeah, they did.  What happened?  I didn't see it.  Danny is entering the studio.  Yes, Danny.  Yeah, well, I saw that they had went live.  He's not that tall, Eric.  Jesus.  Move the mic down.  He's shoving it into his face.  He's shoving it into his forehead.  I saw that they had went live and I'm screaming.  I'm like, all right, man, they're live because he had already missed about four times to  do this.  Oh, jeez.  I said, they're live now.  Go, go, go. 
[01:04:30]  He hangs up the phone with me.  Like, I need to spot him to tell him where to stand and where to be in the frame.  Stupid hangs up and then pulls off a terrible assault.  What did it look like?  It was just like he was way too far behind and he was just kind of, he was holding it  up, putting it down, running the other way, holding it up, putting it down, holding it  up, putting it down.  Who was it?  He had no idea where he was in the frame, how high it was.  It was on a bad angle.  Who went?  Bill.  It was Bill?  Oh, that's...  He's doing aerobics.  Yeah, pretty much. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, that stinks.  I don't know why, but there's opportunities here in New York that are guarantees and we  send the new guys out for some reason.  The new guys suck.  How did we get the first batch of guys that were so good?  Remember Fan?  Remember how good he was?  He doesn't do it anymore.  Danny?  He doesn't do it anymore.  I can't be bothered by this anymore.  They send out the newbies and they fuck it all up.  How did he...  He hung up the phone.  You wouldn't think you'd have to brief people this much. 
[01:05:30]  Bill, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Bill, what happened?  I went in front of the news broadcast.  I got on and then the fucking guys...  They sent guys after me and then when I went and realized, I ran past it and then the fucking  goon, whop, fucking guy stole my sign.  They took your sign?  Yeah, the second time.  And they stole the sign?  But they grabbed my arm and then grabbed it out.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I think you were on screen for about, I don't know, two seconds maybe. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Bill, you did a really, really bad job.  Hey, did I get on at all?  For two seconds, not even, a split second, you were too far away.  You hung up the phone with your spotter that is supposed to direct you as to what to do.  I said I was live and I threw the phone down because I went live.  Yeah, but it's supposed to be you're live, go, and then you're supposed to listen to him  go, okay, move left, move right, go in closer.  Like he's supposed to talk you in.  You don't hear from the control tower if you're a pilot. 
[01:06:30]  Hi, we're picking you up on final.  Okay, bye.  And then land the plane.  You got to get...  They got one of the people working for Channel 11 two blocks down with me right now.  You want to talk to her?  Yeah, sure.  What's up?  All right.  Hey there.  Hi.  Who are you?  Yeah, she took...  Hello?  Tell her we need our sign back.  We need our sign back, miss.  Who was that?  Why did your goons take my sign? 
[01:07:00]  I don't even know who this person is, but she's playing stupid.  Tell her that's your property and you need it back.  That's private property, miss.  I'm going to need that back.  XM Satellite is going to sue you.  Channel 11, Viacom, whoever you work for.  Did I say that?  Viacom.  I work for Opie and Anthony.  That's right, Opie and Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha, that's right.  Anthony, yes, Anthony Cumia, Greg Hughes, they're going to come down here with their lawyers. 
[01:07:30]  They're going to get their sign back.  This guy's a mess.  I love it.  I feel you're a mess.  I love it.  They can send the whole NYPD after and they don't care.  So who is she, Bill?  She's a worker for Channel 11, apparently.  She's two feet away from me about, well, on about 40th Street, I guess.  Oh, she's making sure you don't go back in the shot, I guess.  Yeah, she's very close.  There's a 40-year-old woman blocking you?  Run around her.  Ask her if we can talk to her on the show.  Yo, you want to talk to him on the show? 
[01:08:00]  Nah, she's shrugging, no.  All right.  All right, we're going to mark down Channel 11.  We'll get him bad next time.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  What should I do?  I don't know.  Hold on.  The boys will talk to you.  All right, there goes Bill, the intern.  How many signs do we have?  Do we have any left?  Yeah.  We have a few.  Yeah?  Can't keep losing them like that.  You guys never lost signs.  Jesus Christ.  Well, boy, they just don't know how to do it, the new guys.  We failed today, but we had a fine assault on the media down there in Philly. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Got to love Philly.  Steve, where are you going?  This is you.  He's going to see if his car is recharged.  Tell us about the assault on the media in Philly.  They were, a couple guys were at, I think his name's Nick, were at the Philadelphia Eagles  home opener.  And it looks like they were there early in the morning, because in the video that he sent  in, they're making French toast.  Tailgating, making French toast.  Tailgating, making French toast.  But then WPVI, Channel 6, I think, sent their reporter down to do a story from the home 
[01:09:00]  opener.  And these two guys jumped in the middle of the frame.  One guy's covered in wow stickers.  Bill, covered.  Yeah.  I mean, his whole front is wow stickers.  That's awesome.  The other guy has an air horn, and they just, like a couple of gorillas, jumped in the front  of the frame and just start screaming, Opie and Anthony, 202.  And they blast off the air horn and then take off out of the frame.  The video's great.  It's up on OpieandAnthony.com?  Certainly is.  Yeah, it's the Assault on the Media contest for September.  It's starting to really kick into high gear here. 
[01:09:30]  It's Boston versus Philly at this point, right?  Yeah.  You think this one's better than the guys in Boston?  On par with, if not better.  I got better video and audio of the one that happened in Boston, and that's, now that I've  seen that and heard that, that's really good, too.  All right.  So you got the new video of the Boston Assault up there as well.  We had a bad copy of that.  Yeah, we got better audio right now.  We have a better copy of that, finally.  All right, this is the Assault on the Media that went down over the weekend in Philly.  Let's check it out here, the audio portion.  Let's get a look at the early tailgating. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, Amy, they're already out here.  Tailgating season is here.  Pre-gay revelry.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, I knew the tailgaters would be out here early this morning, and they are out  here in full force in the parking lot by Lincoln Financial for now.  As you can see.  Do it, do it, do it.  Come on, bro.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, we had those guys.  Oh.  Oh, it was great.  She had to make like it was all fun.  She had to acknowledge them.  Okay, thank you.  Well, we have those guys, but you got to understand, the guy was a raving lunatic. 
[01:10:30]  Show the video to Bill.  Raving lunatic, screaming, yelling, his friend's got an air horn, just wrecking her live shot  big time.  Look at this guy.  He's covered.  The cameraman's trying to keep him out of frame.  And what's part two of this?  Well, it's more visual than audio, but you do hear them try to make a second attempt,  and they jump back in the frame, and the cameraman is so frazzled by the whole thing.  He's trying, he's wiggling the camera all in a figure eight, trying to keep it away  from them, but they still get in the frame.  All right.  Should we play the audio?  Is it worth it? 
[01:11:00]  You'll hear it.  You'll hear a little bit of them scream O and A.  But the video's better.  The video's better.  All right.  Who wants to give me a prediction for the final score?  38-13 birds.  38-13 birds.  You heard it here.  All right, guys.  It's my first tailgating live shot of the season.  You got to give me my first Eagles cheer.  Let's hear it.  Right there.  E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!  Awful.  All right.  But the video's much better.  You got to check it out on opianthony.com.  Our first tailgate live shot, huh? 
[01:11:30]  The guys that did it are on the phone.  Jim in Philly.  Jim, what's up?  Yo, guys.  What's up?  What's going on?  It was you and your brother?  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to call my brother back.  I'm going to call my brother now.  He's probably still sleeping.  All right.  And we'll give you a call back.  Both of us.  All right.  Do that.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Because I'm sure both of them on the phone will just make it that much better.  He's probably still taking his stickers off.  There are so many on him.  Well, we got to figure out who's in the lead because the contest has, what, a little less 
[01:12:00]  than two weeks?  All right.  Up for grabs, we've got a portable Delphi MiFi radio.  Dinner with our own Eric Erock Nagel at Paisano's and Mulberry Street in the heart of Little  Italy.  The Erock part of that is optional.  Admission to see Fon Jovi perform live at the grand opening of the Nokia Theater in Times  Square.  Isn't that tonight?  Oh, is that?  Sorry.  That might be an old list.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That would be a problem.  Erock going to foot the bill?  That would be nice of him.  Now that he's a wealthy man. 
[01:12:30]  I think Joey Paisano's footing the bill.  They're live, too.  Still on 42nd.  42nd, what?  2nd Avenue?  He screwed up so badly, Bill.  He should have.  He should have.  They're still live.  It's a perfect opportunity.  They're still live.  Here it is.  Perfect opportunity for an assault on the media.  They're going to be there a while.  And now that they're holding back our guy, we've got to get back there.  Who is this guy that's kissing these girls?  It's kiss for the cause.  I don't know.  Who is he?  So popular star, I guess. 
[01:13:00]  He's kissing chicks for money.  His agent told him it was good exposure.  Yeah.  That's got to be a punch the agent moment.  Yeah.  Well, you're going to be on the WB11 news, which is bad enough.  And you're going to be kissing girls.  Wonderful.  Career's going well.  People know that you care.  Yeah.  It's care, you know.  And we can actually figure out how long you're there, and that's a money value, and then that  can be written off as a deduction at the end of the year. 
[01:13:30]  Look what caring has done for Angelina Jolie.  This is just the beginning.  Yeah, it's just like what she does.  The assault on the media, yes.  Also, you win a 30-day free video game rental from Gamefly.com, and, of course, admission  to the O.P. Anthony show for a day to check out what we do here.  Sit there and watch us through the glass.  Yeah.  Well, here's the audio of the Boston assault on the media from Boston Strangler and Sonny  Ferrelli.  The audio's much better than the one we played last week. 
[01:14:00]  Yes, we're very happy to say that, but, you know, David, it is coming, and I'm sorry  to be the bearer of bad news, but, folks, remember these, the good old shovel and broom?  Well, we're going to have to get real familiar with these, because if you don't sing your  car off of a truck, you're going to be fine.  I don't know why I laugh every time at the pests.  I love how they're on XM Satellite Radio Radio. 
[01:14:30]  One guy started that a while ago, and now everyone's following someone.  Yeah, the dude from Alabama.  Was it Alabama or the guy from Springfield?  Oh, well, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, the guy from Alabama was the one that just had the  exaggerated, yeah, the lion suit and the southern drawl.  So the videos are all up on opiananthony.com, foundrymusic.com.  We've got to start figuring out who's in the lead.  Is it the one you just heard or the new one over the weekend that the guys pulled off  in Philly?  All right.  You got a clip of Rob Bartlett on Imus as well? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, that's...  On this desk?  He was wearing the Spread the Virus shirt and goes into one of those, he's doing his deranged  Brian Wilson impressions.  Yeah, right.  And he goes into the satellite radio debate as Brian Wilson.  It was really funny last week.  Imus did us a huge, huge solid...  Yeah, we caught a couple of pieces of it live.  We plunked it down, but I guess this is the whole thing that he was talking about.  Yeah, Rob Bartlett doing, like you said, Brian Wilson all fucked up, but he's wearing  an opiananthony t-shirt.  Brian Wilson here with us this morning with his opiananthony t-shirt on. 
[01:15:30]  If you have a satellite radio, can you listen to Sirius or XM, or do you have to have two  separate radios?  Well, you'd have to have two separate radios, I mean, if you wanted Sirius, which you wouldn't  want.  Well, yeah, you would want that.  Okay.  You're one Sirius.  I don't own any XM stock.  Well, that's your first mistake, don't you?  Could be. 
[01:16:00]  It might be, yeah.  You should invest in yourself.  That's the first thing I tell you.  How do you think I lost all the publishing rights of my songs?  Well, I'm not sure how that happened.  There you have it.  I remember that.  Yeah, we actually pretty much did play that whole thing, didn't we?  That was the only one we did play live on the show.  Jesus.  Good job.  Way to go, Steve.  You're welcome.  You got a disc of what we said ten minutes ago?  Maybe we can play that. 
[01:16:30]  Good job there, Steve old boy.  All right.  Should we get into the Emmys?  Yeah, I missed it.  So I'm just going to have to depend now on clips.  I missed it too.  You did?  Yeah.  Remember when you used to watch shit like that?  Well, that was when we were doing afternoon drive.  We could stay up late.  What time was it on late?  Eight o'clock.  I just saw a little bit of that Black Eyed Peas rapping.  Yeah.  With the earth, wind, and fire. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, that sounded horrible.  I didn't, again, didn't hear it, but just the setup.  It was horrible, and they were just cutting to people in the crowd,  and they were like, yeah.  They had that look on their face.  Okay, the camera's on me, so I'm going to smile.  But I'm really puzzled?  Yeah.  Like, what the hell is this?  Then he made, like, a reference to the Michael Jackson trial.  Like, remember the verdict?  Like, why would...  Like...  Exactly.  It's like, most people there, especially because it's such, like, a white crowd,  most of them think he's guilty.  Right.  The jurors even think he's guilty. 
[01:17:30]  They all came out and said they know he's guilty.  These award shows have huge problems.  No one's really watching them that much anymore.  So they have to get gimmicks to try to make them...  Can I interrupt you?  Sure.  The dude's back from Philly, and he can't get his brother on.  Oh, well, this will be great.  This is an exclusive interview with Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  So you did that assault to the media in Philly, right?  Yeah, we were planning it.  We know that they're there.  We're there early in the morning, 6 o'clock for every game.  Yeah.  So we know that they're going to be there. 
[01:18:00]  We knew they were going to be doing live shots.  They're going to be doing every single year on opening day.  What time is game time?  Game time is 1 o'clock.  You get there at 6 in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, for every game.  If it's 5 before 15, we're there at 6.  Monday night game, we usually stay the night before and play cards.  Why?  Because I'm telling you, it's all about the tailgating.  What?  7 hours of tailgating?  6 in the morning?  When I used to live in Buffalo, and the bills were huge back then, we would...  Honestly, we weren't there at 6, but we were there by 9. 
[01:18:30]  Dude, it's Buffalo.  Five hours in, you've got to be doing heroin at that point.  Yeah, what is there to do?  You're drinking beers, you're cooking.  I see you get there, you're all like, yeah, let's go, let's throw around the football.  After like an hour, two hours, you're like, yeah.  You want to throw the football around again?  No.  It's a big party.  I'm tired.  You're drinking, you're cooking, you're throwing the ball around.  When I was at 20 and at the peak...  Hold on, hold on, Jim, Jim, hold on, hold on, hold on, we'll get right back to you.  Hold on.  Bill Burr is speaking.  When I was 20 years old, at the peak of my alcohol intake, we used to show up to Patriots 
[01:19:00]  games at about 9.30, and I was fucking obliterated.  By game time.  By 12, still at another hour.  I had already puked on this dude's lawn, and they asked us to move the car.  Never made the kickoff.  Well, no, there is such thing as too much tailgating.  No, man, we used to, it was a whole thing.  We'd rally the troops, get everyone up and out the door, and we would be set up by like 
[01:19:30]  9 in the morning, four hours before game time, and you're just getting psyched, especially  if your team's good.  I'll tell you something, at this time of year, maybe, not that much, not that many hours,  but maybe, you know, a few hours ahead of time, but in the middle of the winter, you  will never, ever see me at a football game.  There is nothing worse than sitting in sub-zero weather in those seats where everyone's so bundled  up, you can barely even stand up, and your seat disappears onto other people's jackets  the second you stand up.  It's cold, uncomfortable. 
[01:20:00]  You're describing what I did at least a dozen times in Buffalo.  Yeah, well, when you're in Buffalo, you're hoping maybe that'll kill you.  No, it's a...  Buffalo sucks.  That's the best part.  I was working for a radio station.  Buffalo really does stink.  Oh, one of the most depressing cities ever.  It's, it's, it's...  Just being there, I was looking around, like, so depressed.  It's fish fry, chicken wings, and the Buffalo Bills.  Fat chicks.  Well, Buffalo Bettys, yes.  Yeah.  They like the long sweaters to cover up a world of hurt. 
[01:20:30]  But, uh, I, uh, when I was living in Buffalo, it was kind of funny.  I worked for this station called The Fox, and the big executives, the general manager and  the program director and what have you, the top sales guy, they got the, you know, the tickets  for the Bills games, the first few games when it was still 80 degrees out, you know, and  they're in the fifth row, uh, 50-yard line.  These tickets were just so wheat.  Right.  As soon as the temperature dropped, they didn't want to go to the games anymore. 
[01:21:00]  So, me, I'm the overnight douchebag.  All of a sudden, I'm sitting in prime seats.  I'm not making any money.  I can't afford to go to a Bills game and sit this close, ever.  So, to me, it didn't matter how cold it got.  I was so psyched.  No, no, no.  But the, the coldest game, the Bills played the Saints, it was single digits with a wind  chill that brought it way below zero, right?  What was that, like an August 29th preseason game?  And, uh, and it had some of that, that dumb sleet ice snowstorms during the week, and they 
[01:21:30]  cannot thaw out the, the stadium for the game and, and get rid of the ice that built up.  So, you had to sit on a block of ice that easily was four inches thick, and your feet  were on a block of ice that was easily four inches thick.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  That's great.  And it was below zero with the wind chill, single digits, snowing like a mother, and  you just sat there and froze.  You couldn't, oh yeah.  You couldn't.  People who were warm, I love the people who have that whole hunting outfit.  Well, that's a camouflage jumpsuit with that fucking orange hat. 
[01:22:00]  You were, like, twice as big with all the layers you had on, and we sat there and watched  the game.  It is not comfortable to sit there in those seats, bundled up like that.  And, obviously, you have to, because you'd freeze to death, you would die in that kind  of cold.  But, yeah, I mean, we were younger, too, you know?  When you're younger...  No, even then, didn't care.  Really?  When you're younger, you could deal with a lot of that stuff a lot easier, too.  I like going to a good old baseball game.  There you are, in your t-shirt, sitting in the seat, sun's shining, nice and warm. 
[01:22:30]  That's what you want.  Not in the middle of the winter, sitting outside.  Would you do anything out in that kind of cold?  Anything else, where you would sit for hours on end in the freezing cold?  Well, skiing.  Skiing?  Yeah.  I would ski with single digits and stuff.  How long has your average football game last?  Yeah, but you're moving when you ski.  About 40 minutes, maybe.  I mean, total, right?  What are you there for?  Four hours sitting in that cold?  Three.  Tops three. 
[01:23:00]  You wouldn't sit and watch strippers if the seats were that cold, if you were sitting  there in that freezing weather.  You're going to sit and watch a goddamn football game you could watch in the comfort of your  own home.  You just don't get...  Not into it.  ...be a fanatic.  No.  Have you ever been a fanatic as far as a sports team goes?  I love going to Yankee playoff games.  That's it.  That's where you'll get me.  Do you paint your face so you'll get on TV?  Of course.  Look at this character. 
[01:23:30]  Here's a happy fan.  All right.  So, Jim, what happened?  Well, it was a perfect setup because the guys that were right in front of the shot, right  behind the shot, had a bus with a satellite dish and the TV was right there.  Right.  And they were watching their buddies in the live shot.  So we knew exactly when to jump in.  Yeah, it was perfect, man.  Were you the one covered in the WOW stickers?  No, that was my younger brother.  I had the tattoos.  All right.  Yeah, right on.  I see you.  But when we were doing it, the camera guy was so freaked out he didn't know what to do. 
[01:24:00]  And he's just waving his hand and his eyes are as big as goddamn softball.  And he's like, no, no, no, no, no.  And then if you see real quick, he actually put his hand in front of the goddamn lens.  I was on and started to crack up.  And then when he shot, he tried to shoot in front of my foot and I crouched down.  I'm like, fuck this guy.  He's not getting any out of shot.  And I put the hair horn up and then I broke away.  My friend was like, fuck it, I'm going back over there.  So he's standing in the back. 
[01:24:30]  And then when he ran in front again, the guy shot the camera down to his feet.  And then what happened?  We were, uh, we'll get him next week.  It was a great assault on the media, it really was.  It's very close to the one done in Boston.  We've got to figure out who's in the lead today.  Camera guy's panic.  Our whole goal was to jump between the reporter and the camera.  We wanted to be the whole shot.  Nothing in the background.  We wanted to be the focus of the shot.  This could be a new trend.  People finally, you know, stepping in front of the reporter. 
[01:25:00]  In front of the reporter.  More exposure.  Absolutely.  I notice these guys follow trends.  You know, I'm noticing the air horn is really starting to play into these things a lot more.  You know, you guys are on a road to ruin here.  Everyone's got pizza.  And then he's punching the reporter.  No, it's all not.  Putting a chloroform rag over the cameraman.  We've made it perfectly clear that the reporter should not be touched.  Perfectly clear.  Nick, what's going on?  Well, that was my brother, so.  Yeah.  He pretty much told.  Yeah, I'm strong, daddy. 
[01:25:30]  What?  I knew it would get better with both of them on.  I knew it.  Well, come on.  Shut the hell up, Jim.  You're an idiot.  Oh, I'm a fan.  You know how are you going to do that one?  See?  Look at this horrid radio.  And these two, they're just yapping over each other.  Let's try Nick.  Nick, you were the one that had the wow stickers all over your body during the assault on the media in Philly.  Yeah.  Oh, I was the guy that had me, I think.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, screw it. 
[01:26:00]  Bill Burr, Barry Spirit Special is awesome.  I can't get a goddamn world in.  Punch it out.  All right.  There they go.  Thanks, guys.  Greatly appreciate it.  There goes Nick and Jim from Philly.  They had a fine assault on the media.  Just because they can do an assault on the media doesn't mean they know how to speak on the radio properly.  All right.  Mark in L.A.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, guys.  I was listening to Sirius here and I got both of them going.  And Cousin Brucey had a live feed going from Little Italy.  And at one point, he was interviewing a lady and some listener broke through and screamed, 
[01:26:30]  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Rock.  That was pretty funny.  Brucey started laughing and I was cracking up and so forth.  He came back pretty quick.  Then he went to a record and came back and pointed out that the listener apparently knocked somebody over and was kind of shitty about it.  So I thought that was very uncool over there.  All right.  Thanks for that.  Maybe we'll get audio of that as well. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  We want to talk about the Emmys.  I was waiting for you to hit the car crash.  That guy was like a train wreck.  He got that sound effect.  He goes, go ahead.  He's like, I was pretty cool.  And, you know, Cousin Brucey laughed.  There are a couple of things.  Sometimes their voice just hypnotizes me and I nod off and forget to hit the buttons.  Other times I want to see how far he's going to go to try to get some kind of reaction from us that we are enjoying his call.  Oh, and the more he was bombing, the more he had to throw in funny. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  He had to throw in other things.  And then he went over there with him.  That was mildly amusing.  And then he walked down the corner.  That was kind of funny.  There was a moment where his story ended and everyone knew it.  It was at the point where he talked about the guy saying what he said in front of Brucey.  Story over.  He didn't get a reaction.  He was like, God, because Brucey laughed.  And then I got a kick out of it.  That was amusing.  And then the guy went around the corner.  And now it's all him trying his best to bail himself out.  When you end it, you jump immediately into your next subject. 
[01:28:00]  And the whole thing was pretty funny.  Gee, it's been hot out lately, hasn't it?  You're just trying to save yourself.  Well, this guy's got something for the show.  Chuck and Jersey.  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Chuck.  Not everybody at those football games is bundled up.  There's always those two idiots there who've got their bellies painted the color of the team.  Yeah.  How about the guys that do that when it's like 20 degrees out, too?  And then the announcers go, wow, those guys are crazy. 
[01:28:30]  Because they don't have a shirt on or coats or anything.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you going to play the ping pong in the back now?  You guys are assholes.  I'm punching out.  Thank you, sir.  Ant, the best way to beat the cold is a hit of mescaline.  My brother and I took a couple of hits at the Jets game.  The look on the people's faces when it's five degrees, you're shirtless, steam is pouring  off you, and you're drinking beer is priceless.  Mescaline. 
[01:29:00]  I'd be afraid I'd do something so stupid and I wouldn't realize, like, my core temperature  was 80 degrees and I'm dying.  Yeah.  And you're not beating the cold.  No.  You're just tricking your mind into not feeling the warning signs that you need to put a shirt  on.  You're still going to get frostbite.  Yeah.  Your body doesn't all of a sudden become immune to dying from the cold.  You just think it's hysterically funny.  Like mescaline's like mittens.  Mescaline is great.  And I could say that would probably be really funny looking at cold people when you're doing  mescaline because everything's hysterically funny on mescaline and just looking at people's 
[01:29:30]  distorted cold faces, you'd probably laugh your ass off.  Maybe the laughter would keep you warm.  All right.  Ooh, hot out, huh?  All right.  Why don't we go back to Emmy talk?  I was going to say, I think that this topic, you just bomb on it.  There's no way to keep yourself safe in this topic.  I want out. 
[01:30:00]  Bill's back in studio.  Do we want Bill?  Yeah, we got to talk to him for a second because he really...  Hi, Bill.  How you doing?  All right.  What happened, Bill?  Okay.  I'll tell you, not intimidating enough.  He's crazy eyes.  He looks like a lunatic, but you're not a big enough guy.  Yeah.  Dan's tall, you know.  He's intimidating a little bit.  I'll get it.  I'll put this here.  Okay.  But you kind of look like someone who I can easily take your sign away from.  Well, here's the thing. 
[01:30:30]  I went down there, and there's cops on at least three of the corners of the blocks.  Uh-huh.  About 200 cops, I would say, in a two-block radius.  Yeah.  200 cops?  200 cops in two blocks.  The UN is over there, right.  So I started hanging around, because it's on the corner of the building.  You got diagrams?  Yeah.  Is that a diagram you have?  Now, yellow is the cops, and my root was the pink, and the blues, the thugs for 11.  You color-coded a chart.  Yeah.  Well, I'm proving that what I did was the best possible thing I could have done. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, because the drawing proves it.  It does.  Hey, I'm with Bill.  Now, the motorcade turned where?  Yeah, where's the grass?  I was originally here, and I called Danny.  He's like, yo, call me when you think something's going on.  So I went over here to-  Wait, you've got to show everybody the diagram.  The north part of 42nd.  Is there a north, south, east, west on that diagram?  Yeah.  Right north, and?  There you go.  Okay, let me see.  North, south.  Okay, north is that way.  Yeah, that's definitely north.  Now, when I was over- 
[01:31:30]  And that's 42nd and 2nd.  Wait, no, the-  Clearly, I mean, you can see-  Oh, no, no, now north is south.  What's that?  Now we've got a problem.  You just turned it upside down.  Yeah, this is north.  Yeah, you better-  There it is.  There you go.  So north is now.  Yeah, because that Starbucks right there is-  Yeah, that's on the north.  Yeah, east corner.  So I was on the north side.  This is the only part they're wearing cops until they parked next to me and moved this  way.  So that's north.  Yeah, and then I was up here, and then one day-  What represents the cops, that circle?  The yellow.  Because I see yellow.  All the yellow.  Oh, all the yellow is cops.  Yeah, now-  Why don't you go with blue?  I mean, the police officers. 
[01:32:00]  Blue's for the fucking wops that were over here.  That should have been red.  The fucking short haircuts and the stupid fucking clothes.  Let them Armani exchange.  Scumbags.  Now, let's-  Here's the-  Wow.  Wow, Jesus.  Now, listen.  Listen to me, jerky.  Calm down.  I just feel like a dick, because fucking-  Over here's the goddamn Mexicans.  They've been taking all the fucking jobs.  So I'm standing here.  Mexicans in the stands, so I'm pulling spring while I'm waiting.  Uh-huh.  And I went down, and because Danny's like, oh, they went live.  But they weren't going- 
[01:32:30]  What I was looking at is the chair where the guy was sitting.  Is that south?  When you went down?  Yeah, I went south.  And I was going to go behind the chair and get him.  But I didn't realize there was a second table, which they must have went live to a few  times, because I totally couldn't see it from this part.  Uh-huh.  So I went down, and Danny said, I stood here for about two minutes.  And then Danny's like, they go live.  With the WAPs, right?  Yeah, WAPs.  Jews, all those people.  And the garbage bag, because I couldn't rip it out with one hand.  I had to-  Where were the Polish people in that diagram?  Were they anywhere?  I think they were on the east side, right?  Yeah, on the docks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, on the docks. 
[01:33:00]  Right, they're working the docks.  So you couldn't pull the sign out of the bag quickly.  Well, not with two.  I needed two hands.  That's why the phone must have got hung up.  Oh, that's right.  Danny said, you're live.  Now, what you're supposed to do is hold onto the phone so he can direct you.  But you had to get rid of the phone so you could pull the sign out of the bag.  Yeah.  Then I jumped over the caution tape, and I ran behind with the sign as best I could, behind  the actual caution tape.  And then that's when the goon started getting me.  Then I went-  What did the Puerto Ricans do at that point?  Oh, they pulled out their box cutters and chased me on the road. 
[01:33:30]  The goons, you mean, the dagos and the Jews.  Yeah.  They came after you.  So I ran, and then he's like, they're alive again.  So I ran around that black woman who followed me.  I ran all the way around back into the thing again with the sign.  That's when the guy grabbed my right hand and he pulled it out.  What was the guy, Italian?  Yes.  Yeah.  And he pulled the sign out of your hand.  Yeah.  And what was the colored lady doing at this point?  This is when the colored lady in pink started following me for a few blocks.  Ah, she followed you. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And what did they do with your sign?  You didn't see?  No, the guy grabbed it and said, fuck off.  And he took it behind the caution tape and must have threw it out inside the Channel 11 building.  It's kind of edgy for Channel 11, huh?  Yeah.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  That's strong language.  Let's say hi to Bill the Cop.  Bill?  Hello, gentlemen.  Hey, Bill the Cop.  How are you?  Pretty good.  How about you, boys?  All right.  We were told, I was working down at the UN, and we were told anybody that fucks with the  media, just grab them and lock them up. 
[01:34:30]  What's the charge, sir?  It's going to be, like, disorderly conduct and then other shit with the fucking media.  That's a little too technical for him.  Other shit.  Other shit with the fucking media.  Yeah, fucking with the media in the first degree.  Yeah.  Huh?  I saw a bunch of people with ONA signs, and people were like, oh, go get them.  I was like, fuck you.  I love those guys.  Wow.  I once pled other shit down to mayhem.  Simple charge.  Other shit.  Thanks, Bill.  That's a cop describing a charge. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, Christ.  All right.  Well, they had everything there.  Even the auxiliary police.  They had the guys.  Really?  Well, those guys are scary, you know.  Those are the ones you've got to watch out for.  But they had the real police officers right here.  The auxiliary are the ones you've got to worry about, because they're not good enough  to be real police officers, so they've got something going on in their head.  They think if they make a good collar, they might make the force.  Yeah.  They can do something stupid.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to prove, is what you're saying.  Well, Bill had proof that he did everything he could, but it just was a diagram. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, it was pretty convincing.  It was still a failed assault on the media.  It was cool.  I would have actually ran into it and started cursing or something, but I didn't want to  push it too far.  I didn't want to get anybody into it.  Yeah, don't push it too far.  Just get a split second of the thing on camera.  I'm sorry.  So what happened when...  What baby steps?  That's good.  Yeah.  I would have just started dropping the C word and ran into it, like right in front  of the donkey and the Mexican guy with the thing.  What's the donkey?  They got the Colombian guy next to the table, which was the second place they were shooting 
[01:36:00]  on the one corner.  That's what I didn't see.  Why did you call him a donkey?  No, he's with the donkey.  It's the Juan Valdez.  Oh, Juan Valdez, the coffee guy?  They actually got something like that there.  I don't know.  Juan Valdez will say every slur to every race, but he won't say cunt.  He's like the C word.  Right, the C word.  I don't want to offend anybody.  I mean, on the live show, you know.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I'll go do it.  Tell me to do something, I'll go do it.  I don't care.  We love you like that.  Well, we told you to do something.  You're quite a soldier.  But he's got diagrams.  And until he brought that out, though, I was... 
[01:36:30]  I see it his way now.  Yeah.  It's very obvious.  I'm in his corner now that he's been so concise with the yellow and the brown and the  red and the pink.  And the arrows, the corners, the streets, the directions.  No time code on that.  Little McGraw Hill logo in the corner.  Bill, where on that map did you drop the sign and leave it on the floor for about 20 seconds?  What?  When you dropped the sign.  When you walked right into the shot, dropped the sign in the bag.  Because I had to pull it out of the bag.  That's why I had to hang up the phone.  You saw that in the shot? 
[01:37:00]  Him dropping the sign and pulling it out of the bag?  That's why I had to take the...  This could be very funny, then, on tape.  I want to see this.  I want to see it, too.  You see the sign in the garbage bag.  It's just right on the left-hand side of the screen.  You just see it comes out of nowhere.  It just flies into the shot and just lands on the floor.  Oh, no.  That's the garbage bag, though.  I left the garbage bag and wandered throughout the scene like a tumbleweed.  I could swear that you went back and forth.  I threw the garbage bag into the scene.  It actually got caught by the wind and probably tumbled through it.  I think it could be a new contest, failed assault in the media.  Winner. 
[01:37:30]  Winner.  A blooper tape.  Yeah.  A gag reel.  All right.  Well, it was his first attempt.  I think he did a good job.  First attempt.  I'm just happy I got on.  Yeah.  Very good.  I'm pretty annoyed that I...  Next one, I see you doing much better now that you got one under your back.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  Thank you, guys.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  There goes Bill, the intern.  He's doing a great job.  There we go.  I'm taking his diagram with him.  Oh, in the garbage.  Wow.  He's been acquitted.  Well, you might want to throw that online. 
[01:38:00]  I think people want to see your plan.  Auction it off.  Yeah, well, let's just throw it on opandentony.com.  The diagram of the assault on the media gone wrong.  His diagram.  Let me talk after this.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  All right.  Why is it that I'm a weirdo for wrapping toilet paper around my finger to make myself...  Well, because it's not your nostril.  Yeah, no.  It is your ass.  No, no.  Why not just blow your nose?  Oh, I do. 
[01:38:30]  I blow my nose, but sometimes it's just something hanging on there.  It's very sticky sometimes.  Jimmy, no offense.  I've never heard anyone else doing what you do.  I know.  It's odd.  But I don't violate your ass with your own finger and toilet paper.  For the new listeners, he wraps a bunch of toilet paper around his one finger, his index  finger, and he shoves it up.  Up there.  How far?  Knuckle?  Two knuckles?  You guys make it seem like I'm running and jamming it.  No, I just gently...  No, not just...  How high?  I don't know.  Maybe...  One or two knuckles.  Up to the watch. 
[01:39:00]  How far do you go?  One or two?  One, dude.  Not two.  One.  One?  I think one's even weird, though, man.  One is a little weird.  I think it's a little weird, bro.  It is.  You should just...  It's a little weird.  You know, the surface is fine.  You can get a good, you know, get a good cleanup going, but you don't have to go up in  there.  One foot on the seat, one on the floor, bent forward.  Like we were discussing last week, as long as the door's closed, you don't need to know  what's behind that door.  He's got a whole stance and everything. 
[01:39:30]  One foot...  Wait a minute.  It's like a Heisman trophy.  On the toilet top.  You get up off the toilet.  I stand.  You stand up.  Yeah.  Now you...  Hold on.  You can't stand.  That messes up everything back there.  It mushes them back together.  No, can I stand?  It's kind of like the...  Hold on, hold on.  I got a quick thing.  All right.  It reminds me of, you know, painting as a kid.  And you have paint on one side, and then they make you fold the paper.  Oh, like a paint slot.  Yeah, and then you open up, it's like, ah, wow, now that paint's over there. 
[01:40:00]  You're doing a Rorschach test between your butt cheeks.  How did you know that was called a Rorschach test?  You don't know that?  No one knows that.  Rorschach didn't know they named it after him until he just heard you say it.  What I do is I stand up.  Now, do you face the toilet?  You turn and face it and put one foot up on it?  That really depends on what the way...  I mean, you kind of have to kind of face the back a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I mean, I don't get backed by the septic tank like I'm Washington on the front of the boat. 
[01:40:30]  Put one foot up and look forward.  Throw a nickel across the bathroom.  He has a toilet stool.  We've discussed that.  We've heard about his toilet stools.  In order to get a good dump, Jimmy has a little footstool that he puts his feet up on.  I don't think that's to help the clean up, right?  No, no, no.  No, while his feet are elevated, it's easier for him to...  It's better for your intestines.  It's a healthier position to be in.  It takes your feet off the floor about six to eight inches.  Yeah.  It just makes your insides bend up a bit.  So he's sitting there like he's in a mercury capsule. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll put my hand on my chin and the other on my knee and I look like the thinker.  But I put, I get off the ball, I put my left foot on the floor, my right foot on the seat.  Oh, my God.  I lean forward.  Lean forward.  I reach back.  Oh, my God.  And the kid gets to work.  You know, that's the same stance, the same pose that's on the tampon boxes for girls to insert the tampon.  There you go.  Yeah.  They put a leg up and then pop it in there. 
[01:41:30]  So you're using that stance, only bend over.  I'm a trainable.  You are a trainable.  Wow.  And how long have you done this?  My whole life.  Your whole entire life.  Yeah.  From the first time you remember wiping, you've stood up.  I'm like, why?  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  That's amazing.  All right.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:42:00]  Talking about searching for a place we could call home.  Realize what a mogul Steve C. is.  Yeah.  Steve now owns two places.  Anthony and I, still renting.  Still looking.  Thanks.  Jesus.  My search has begun, though.  I've got to buy something, finally.  Where?  Where?  Manhattan.  I'm not dealing with that commute anytime soon.  It's not really a bad commute if you live close enough.  Like, well, the city would be very close. 
[01:42:30]  But, I mean, like Great Neck, where I am, it's 20 minutes in in the morning, which is fine.  It's just the drive out.  It's if you ever have to drive during rush hour, that same drive.  But to know that it only takes 20 minutes in real time when there's no one else in your way and to have to sit for an hour and a half sometimes in traffic when you know it's a 20-minute drive is infuriating.  But I don't want to live in the fucking city.  I want a yard.  I want a pool.  I want a compound. 
[01:43:00]  But apparently I have to move out to Orion Point in order to afford something like I want.  Even me, you know, with my trillions of dollars.  It's amazing what they ask for for a house, just a normal run-of-the-mill, here's a house.  You know, oh, great.  If I moved out east, you would have a palatial, I mean a mansion.  You would have one of those lifestyles of the rich and famous houses. 
[01:43:30]  But you're close to the city.  They want a postage stamp of grass, a house thrown on there, maybe a couple of bedrooms, a bath and a half.  There you go.  How much?  Five million.  That's great.  That's great.  It's ridiculous.  But this is a real hot area.  Yeah.  This is a real hot area.  This area.  Let me tell you about the school district.  Shut up.  I don't care.  I'm not having kids ever, ever, ever, ever.  But they always want to tell you about how wonderful the schools are. 
[01:44:00]  The taxes.  Very high here because of the schools.  I want to live here then.  Fuckers.  Real estate.  They bring you in and try to.  Here's the bedroom.  Yeah, I know.  Here's the kitchen.  Oh!  See, now I thought this was the den.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  It's got a great area here.  This is like a counter.  Yeah.  You can even, like, prepare sandwiches.  It's a fucking filling time.  That's it. 
[01:44:30]  I can walk into a house, look around, and know if I want to live there or not.  That's it.  Oh, Manhattan was the greatest when you're walking around looking.  They'll actually do the sweep of the arm as they're showing you a four-foot-by-four-foot area.  Like, and over here's the bedroom.  It's like, it fucking breaks a nail on the wall.  It's like halfway over.  It's like.  Yeah, they show you these little cubbies that they use as, you know, this would be great  for a study or a computer room.  A little, there's always nooks.  This little nook over here for a breakfast table. 
[01:45:00]  This nook.  A little desk would fit in here fine.  You could do your work.  You get a lot of sunlight through that one window that hasn't been washed since 1972.  They take you up into the attic space where the roof line, like you're hitting your head  unless you're dead center in the room, and talk about what a lovely bedroom this would  make, where you would knock yourself unconscious.  Anytime the ceiling is like higher than six feet, they try to act like you can put some  sort of bunk bed in there with a desk underneath it. 
[01:45:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  High ceilings.  It's like you literally, when you wake up in the morning, you've got to like shimmy out.  Even rolling over your shoulder would scrape the ceiling.  That's great.  Bring the girl home, you know, carry her up the ladder, just like a fucking caveman.  It is a scam.  Your ass banging off the ceiling as you're trying to plow some whore.  That'll be like, you know, $725,000.  Yeah, that's it. 
[01:46:00]  And there's always some weird attic storage in those rooms, too.  Like on the wall, you'll see some creepy midget door that you open up, and it goes right  through all the way back.  That's where the rats live.  Yeah, I'm going to go there.  It's like mice and fucking, that's, yeah, exactly.  We went to one house, and the guy is in there, and he's going, yeah, there's a loft upstairs  that's great for, you know, I keep my bedroom up there.  And he had this circular stairway that went up that was like the diameter of a gutter, 
[01:46:30]  the leader that comes down the side of your house.  I couldn't even, it was like I was just rotating in place when I was walking up this circular  staircase.  Yeah, like a corkscrew.  And of course, it's like wonderful circular staircase.  I'm picturing like this huge sweeping staircase.  Titanic looking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  Staircase.  It was like something out of Das Boot.  It was like the gangway in a submarine. 
[01:47:00]  We have this lovely terrace slash fire escape.  You can get a hibachi out there.  The neighbors don't seem to mind if you cook on it.  I know the last guy did, because you can tell, because of the ashes that are all in  the windowsill.  It's just awful.  Just let me look at what I'm asking to look at.  That's all.  The worst ones are the buildings that like allow pets.  It's like, they allow pets here.  It's like, yeah, it smells like a fucking kennel.  Yeah.  It's a frigging kennel.  Right.  Shit all over the place. 
[01:47:30]  Lumps of dog hair in the hall.  That's another.  When you're looking for a house and the homeowner has a pet.  Like when you knock on the door and you hear,  Like, oh, this is going to be great.  I just want to get in the car and leave.  And then the woman opens the door.  Oh, okay.  Just hold on two seconds.  Let me get her in the room.  Dog nails scraping on the linoleum.  Yeah, wood floor with like those skid marks on it where,  you know, he was sliding into the wall.  It just stinks like wet dog.  One place we looked at had a white carpet that I swear this dog 
[01:48:00]  had shit on every square inch of it.  There was just cleaned up shit marks all over the place.  Bites taken out of the corner.  There's a cleaner that becomes a foam as it gets into the shit that's in the rug.  The applicator on the cleaner has a little brush on it.  That's going to work.  And you're looking at the, quote, nice homes.  That's the scary part.  Dude, everything over a million bucks.  Everything over a million dollars.  And a million is the bottom level in this neighborhood. 
[01:48:30]  And there's shit all over the place.  Everything.  The corner bead on all the corners of the house are chewed.  Just eaten.  Where now you've got to get some guy in, repair the drywall, spackle.  And this is a million dollar home.  It's not a fixer-upper.  I'm not.  I don't want to go in and fix something.  I want to move in.  I want it to smell.  When I walk in there, I want it to smell like new carpet and paint.  And that's it.  And you walk in and people are like, this is mint plus plus condition. 
[01:49:00]  So you go to look at it and it's like mint plus plus in 75.  Because there's wood paneling on the walls.  The basements, you go down into the basement.  There's some bar that grandpa built for himself with the Budweiser mirror and the shag carpeting.  Keep on trucking, neon sign.  Some popular catchphrase from the late 70s.  You jive, turkey. 
[01:49:30]  Exactly.  Shag carpet.  You know Tony Danza had that tattooed on his arm?  Oh, yeah.  What?  I saw that for years.  Keep on trucking.  Oh, okay.  That's like getting jiggy with it.  You know, some sort of...  What an ass.  Yeah.  Keep on trucking tattooed.  That must have been a drunk night.  Hey, I don't care.  This saying is going to be around forever, huh?  Keep on trucking.  Put it over here.  And I want a tattoo of my pet rock on this arm.  Put a Rubik's Cube on it. 
[01:50:00]  Some barbed wire.  So the search continues.  So I went to this one place.  We go in and obviously...  You know right from the start you don't want it.  But for some reason you have to look around.  I guess it's an insult.  There's like this protocol.  You got to be cordial to the people and the agent and everybody else.  So you can't just look, walk in and go, nope, and walk out.  You should though.  You should.  When you walk in and I see like structural damage. 
[01:50:30]  You see that the ceiling is cracked.  And from across the room you can see the right side of it is closer to the floor than the left side is.  Right by the crack.  You know that isn't just a little spackle and some tape.  You know, that's a truss in the attic is fucked.  Something is wrong with the structure.  You're living on a fault line.  Yeah, exactly.  There's nothing.  There's something wrong.  So I don't want to look at the bedroom.  I don't want to look at the basement.  But you have to. 
[01:51:00]  We go in this one house.  I know I'm not going to look.  And the guy was crowing on the paper about how there's brand new dry sump.  There's a brand new sump for the driveway.  So I guess the driveway was flooding and now there's a brand new sump.  So we go down into the basement and I'm walking around and there's a brand new tile floor in the basement.  Basement's been finished.  A bathroom down there and everything.  So we're walking around and my girlfriend goes, look under your feet. 
[01:51:30]  So I look down.  Every tile I'm stepping on in between each tile is going.  The water's coming up a little bit.  Water's coming up.  It's coming up.  I go, oh my God.  That's what the dry sump is.  We're in the middle of summer where we haven't had a lot of rain.  We haven't had rain this summer.  Oh my God, Jesus.  Dry sump for the driveway.  I am not.  You know he's down there with a wet vac.  What time did you get in here?  Oh, you know it.  And that's why the brand new, it was brand new tile floor.  They had to rip everything up. 
[01:52:00]  They put in this dry sump hoping that that's going to solve the problem.  Put down new tile when the floor was still just soaked.  See, I'm not looking forward to this.  This is day one today.  Good.  I'm going on.  Day one.  I started looking in spring.  I started looking in spring.  And I've gotten close a couple of times where it was like one house was really nice.  You walk in.  The ceilings were like frigging 18 feet high.  Skylights.  You could open the front door, double doors, and look straight through this real grand hallway 
[01:52:30]  to this huge arched picture window that looked right into the backyard.  And then there were like two wings off to the sides with the living quarters and the bedrooms  and everything.  Beautiful.  We go down to the basement.  It was like a hatched door to go down into this basement where all the other stuff, and  there was only room for the washer and dryer and everything else down there.  So now I'm talking.  They go, well, a staircase can be put in here.  The homeowner is standing in the middle of the living room saying we can cut a hole in 
[01:53:00]  the living room floor to put stairs to the bed.  I'm like, you know, so goddamn close.  Screw that because that's where the ghosts live.  Right.  Won't the banister get in the way of me watching TV?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  It's a living room.  It's a living room.  I'm not going to be cutting holes for the...  And then another problem with that house was there was a two-car garage that was detached.  And I...  The whole point of having a garage is that I don't want to see the winter. 
[01:53:30]  I want to go from my warm house to my warm vehicle.  How to not see the winter.  Now?  That's it.  I don't do it.  The only time he's going to be outside is the 10 feet from his car to the front door  of this building when someone else drives my car to the garage.  That is it.  That's the only time he'll ever see one.  My car is toasty in my heated garage now.  And I walk in...  Because, you know, I went through too many years of hopping in, leaning forward, because 
[01:54:00]  for some reason that makes you warmer, grabbing a steering wheel that looks like...  It feels like an ice carving, and trying to drive.  And trying to drive.  You can see your breath.  Oh!  The inside of your windshield is frozen.  The defroster doesn't work.  And we're all lazy, so we only defrost, what, an inch before we take off for our ride  into work.  And my pinky and ring finger are, like, numb on the steering wheel, because the blood  is just not flowing, because it's so fucking cold, your body's going, no, it's reserved 
[01:54:30]  for your core organs.  Your fingers can suffer.  I'm freezing.  Now?  It's great.  It's like 76 degrees on the coldest winter day.  I go in, I pull out, and by the time I'm driving down the street, I look at the outside temperature  on the rear view mirror of my car, it's like 15 degrees for me.  The heats are blaring.  That's what I like.  I hate the cold.  That's what I'm looking for.  Attached garage. 
[01:55:00]  As some of the realtors, it's a two-car garage.  Listen to this, silly...  And you walk in, and you could not fit one car in the same.  Listen to this, silly goose in Denver.  Go ahead, Richard.  Hey, yeah, listen, my brother's really, really picky, just like you guys.  He knows what he wants.  He can afford it.  So he bought himself a little patch of land down in Phoenix, built his house if he wanted  it.  You guys sound like you need to build a house.  Yeah.  You know something?  I would want to do that.  That's true.  There's no land available! 
[01:55:30]  Where I want to live, it's not exactly a little house on the prairie out there.  It's the North Shore.  I want to live North Shore, Nassau County.  That's where I want to live.  It's all taken up with ancient houses that people know they can get top dollar for a  house that was built in the fucking 50s, not even remodeled.  They get top dollar.  So what I would have to do now is buy a shit house for about $2 million and knock it down. 
[01:56:00]  And then build another house.  I can't do that.  Richard, it's a lot easier in Denver.  There's a lot more land available.  I've been out to Colorado, and I've been into Grand Junction, Colorado.  And I have looked at...  Oh, no, Grand Junction, two, six.  No, I know, but I have looked at houses out there.  I would be able to buy Grand Junction.  The entire city of Grand Junction could be mine if I wanted to live there.  You get a mountain in your backyard.  That's it! 
[01:56:30]  They'd call it Anthony Junction.  I'd change the name.  Anthony Junction.  I would just call it Ant's Junk.  Places in Arizona?  Ant's Junk.  Places in Arizona?  There are places where you would be the king.  I would have whole Indians praying to me as their god, making gold idols of me.  That would be me.  There you go.  All right, Richard.  Thank you.  But in New York, buy a million dollar piece of shit and knock it down.  That's what I get.  Yeah.  For those of you who don't live here, it's like if you ever watch the end credits to Archie Bunker. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Those houses.  Those houses.  That's what it is.  Those houses.  Eight million.  Where there are two houses that are actually connected.  Yeah.  They have two front doors.  And people decide to put separate siding on them so it looks like some schizo house.  You can literally look across your little pathetic chain link fence and see the top of the head of your neighbors.  He's squatting, taking a shit.  Your eyes meet as you're washing a plate.  Have you ever seen, don't you think the neighbors could get together and decide on one color or one type of aluminum siding? 
[01:57:30]  Have you seen the ones that, it's, it's, these are two houses, but they're connected.  They look like one big house, but they're actually two separate houses.  The front doors are separate.  They're kind of right next to each other.  And the whole street is those type of houses.  And they can't agree, like one will paint his house blue and the other paints it red.  It, it's, and it looks ridiculous.  They can't get along and just go, dude, look, I'll foot for the paint. 
[01:58:00]  One color.  Schizo house.  Tommy in Brooklyn, why do you need an attached garage?  You explained that already.  I did.  I want warmth.  Ian in Jersey.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Uh, and I'm looking for a house in Jersey.  I'd love to tell you it's a lot better on our side of the river, but it sucks over here, too.  Uh, I was in a house over the weekend that they had air quoted, uh, converted their garage to a bedroom.  Yeah.  I walk in there, no shit.  They had laid down AstroTurf, pulled, unplugged the garage door opener, and they had all their kids' toys on the weird garage shelf. 
[01:58:30]  So they were trying to scam like they had an extra room?  Yeah.  But, dude, you had to see, you walk in, and they had put, like, this AstroTurf carpet down, and their kid's bed was all the way up against this garage door that was still there.  And you look up, and you see the electric garage door opener that's just unplugged from the little ceiling.  They had their kids sleeping in the garage?  I, I shit you not, Ian. 
[01:59:00]  That's like entrapment for, like, a sexual predator.  Dude, it was hysterical.  It was hysterical, and they had those weird metal bracket garage shelves you put the motor oil on.  Yeah.  You look over, and there's, like, Barbie dolls sitting on these garage shelves.  That is so weird.  Call the authorities.  All right, Ian.  Thank you.  Let's go to Grand Junction.  Eric.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, man.  I just want to tell the guy in Denver that they suck cock.  They couldn't, you couldn't buy Grand Junction. 
[01:59:30]  There's many multi-million dollar homes here.  Yeah, but they're so gigantic, sir.  That's the point I was getting at.  I don't think I was actually putting in a bid for Grand Junction here on our show, sir.  I think it was exaggerated humor.  I know.  I have played, I've played golf at one of the golf courses up there.  The really nice one.  I can't remember the name of it.  It's in Redlands.  Yeah, yeah, Redlands.  Like a little small aspen.  And the houses over there were amazing, and they were under a million bucks. 
[02:00:00]  You should get a summer home out here.  Yeah, I love your summers.  120 degrees.  Wonderful.  Oh, that's too wild.  We only have 100 for about two weeks.  Yeah, dude.  I went out to Grand Junction when it was 100 for something like 10 days in a row.  It was over 100 degrees.  And the winters, even better.  I flew into Grand Junction once, and it was like I stepped off the plane into a freezer.  Not just like cold, freezing cold, but the moisture in the air was suspended frost. 
[02:00:30]  You couldn't see across the street.  Wait, it was frozen fog.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.  There is a valley.  It's not bullshitting.  So the weather, it was so weird.  It was 20 degrees colder in Grand Junction than anywhere around it, and it was freezing everywhere around it.  So driving, your defrosters never worked.  It was constantly frozen.  I had never experienced cold like that in my life.  You're not bullshitting. 
[02:01:00]  We work in the oil field, and the oil field loves you guys.  Oh, cool.  Tell them we said hi, right?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There goes, Eric.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy, what's up?  And I am buying Grand Junction.  Well, why don't you just move to Staten Island and live on Toad Hill?  That way you can join Richmond County.  So you can play golf.  You'd be like freaking Al Chervick.  I'd soon have moved to Jersey, which I wouldn't.  We'll move to Staten Island, Toad Hill.  How Staten Island got to be considered part of New York City? 
[02:01:30]  I'll never know.  I will never know.  That place is the worst.  It is not.  You don't even stop there.  It is a place to drive over on your way to Jersey.  I've been here 10 years.  I've never been there.  Never been there.  The most essential borough to pass through.  I've never.  You drive through it.  Staten Island is there, so they didn't have to make a really long bridge to Jersey.  That's it.  That's all it is.  The best is what they call the Arizona, the guinea gangplank. 
[02:02:00]  The guinea gangplank.  That's the best.  Back to fucking Brooklyn.  Get the fuck out.  I'll punch you now.  All right.  There he goes, Jimmy.  The guinea gangplank.  Can we finally talk about the Emmys or what?  No.  The search for houses and apartments and all that continues for the boys.  Well, have fun.  My favorite part of that was when I totally took it down the Tony Danza route.  It was just really starting to bomb.  And then Opie goes, so anyway, he's back to looking for houses.  That's what he does.  That's what I do.  That's what Opie does.  That's what I do.  I keep everyone focused. 
[02:02:30]  Let's kick it back into play.  I just thought of fucking nowhere.  Out of bounds.  Like the fucking banana split.  Yeah.  Remember the guy dressed up like the dog?  All right.  When's Jimmy coming back?  Not at all.  You're not supposed to acknowledge it.  You're supposed to just go with it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rob in New York.  Rob, what's up?  Yeah.  I wanted to talk about the Emmys, the Black Eyed Peas.  Okay.  They started singing about Michael Jackson's court case.  They were making a comparison because Martha Stewart was convicted and he wasn't. 
[02:03:00]  And she gets a show and he don't get a show.  It's like, ooh, that's terrible.  That's it, guys.  Punch it out.  Oh, you can't punch it out.  Wait, what?  Thanks.  The two cons were a bit different, don't you think?  Yeah, absolutely.  I just wanted to say that the Black Eyed Peas are trying to make a Kanye West reference.  Like the black suck and the white star okay.  Anyways, start over.  I'm a little confused here.  In the lyrics to the Black Eyed Peas song, they were going on about stuff relative to the Emmys. 
[02:03:30]  And they were saying about, you know, entertainers and how they're handled in the media.  Michael Jackson was found innocent and he's looked like forgotten.  And now Martha Stewart is convicted, goes to jail.  She gets a TV show.  So figure that out.  It was kind of like that Kanye West thing, like poor us.  That's how I saw it.  And I know you're there.  So...  All right, Ron. 
[02:04:00]  Wasn't working on him.  He was still very uncomfortable, though.  All right, Emmy talk.  Star Jones was on the red carpet.  And she's like the new thing, I guess, right?  Yeah, she's one of those people that really need to be fat.  She lost a bunch of weight.  And she's one like Al Roker with that head.  That huge head didn't lose any weight.  She still has the fat...  It's still the big fat head. 
[02:04:30]  Another hot chick is missing.  I didn't mean...  College student may have been abducted.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  This girl is really hot and she's missing.  And we better find her soon.  Wow.  We only care about the pretty ones that are missing.  What, any...  You got any background?  No, I just hit Fox News.  Some college student, they think she might have been abducted.  Why is it whenever somebody really huge loses a bunch of weight, they look better fat?  Is it because you saw...  It just looks...  Yeah, it looks weird, I think.  It looks like they're dying or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They're all like gaunt or something. 
[02:05:00]  A lot of people are just meant to be fat, though.  Yeah, it's like...  They're just meant to be fat.  They're not jolly anymore.  Al Roker, fat, jolly.  Now he just looks a little strange.  He looks scary.  Big California raisin head on that little body.  Well, his head's strong.  But the point you're going to make, Star Jones still has the big fat head.  Yeah, the big fat head.  With the watery eyes.  The basset hound eyes she's got.  Yuck.  She was doing the red carp. 
[02:05:30]  Yes, I'm sorry.  My stomach is starting to gurgle.  Oh, no.  Round two might be happening very soon.  Oh, dear.  Are you going to go to the same toilet, or are you just going to make it a complete nightmare  for the guy who cleans it?  Yeah.  Two stalls.  Make him really wonder, did he get up during and go over and figure this out?  I took my mom to dinner last night in Huntington, and I had some kind of fish that was described  as sea bass meets swordfish. 
[02:06:00]  You ate chum.  Chum.  And it was, you know how most fish kind of flakes off nice when you're eating it?  Yeah.  This thing was very chewy.  Chewy fish, never good.  I don't know if fish is supposed to be chewy.  Never.  It's like octopus.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Squid.  Scungil.  Where'd you go?  What was the name of the place?  I don't want to blow up their spot.  Why not? 
[02:06:30]  They gave you a bad fish.  I don't know if it was them, though.  I don't know if it was them.  I've never heard of you.  You're home for chewy fish.  What is it?  I don't know.  You're home for a hybrid.  Yeah.  Hybrid.  Man-made fish.  Hey, we made a salmon.  Fuck a hell of a fish.  Right.  Well, they're doing it with the dogs.  They might as well start with the fish.  Genetic lab in the back.  Anyone else notice what's going on with the dogs?  Anyone else know what's going on with the...  You don't get out of your house, Ant, so you don't know what's going on with the dogs.  God, I'd stay away.  I saw a fucked up one yesterday in the village. 
[02:07:00]  It was like the size of a German shepherd.  The body and the legs were like a little dog's house.  Are you kidding?  Are they doing that kind of cruel stuff?  They're fucking with the dogs big time.  They're creating all sorts of new breeds and stuff.  Wow.  Have you seen...  What are they called?  Doodles?  They're part poodle and part Labrador or something?  Why would it be a Labrador?  I don't know.  Someone explain what a doodle is.  It would be a loodle or a Labrador.  Maybe then I got the other dog wrong.  But they're starting to fuck with the dogs big time. 
[02:07:30]  And some of these...  Some of these things walking around on...  It's like a doodle.  It's half a shepherd.  What's it?  That doesn't make sense.  All right.  We'll get the answer.  Someone tell me what a doodle is.  Here it is.  Doodle dog.  They call it a zippy.  Dachshund and a poodle.  There you go.  It's not a dachshund.  What is it, Eric?  Whatever they cross it with has doodle at the end.  My brother's got a golden doodle.  There's Labradoodles.  There's a whole bunch of these.  Labradoodle?  Oh, so the doodle part is just for the poodle.  Yeah.  And the D is in there so it hooks up with any other word.  Exactly. 
[02:08:00]  Because you can't say Lab-boodle.  Wow.  They are basically taking the poodles and fucking up their world, man.  They're just mixing them with everything.  It's because they don't shed.  That's why they breed them with the poodles.  So you can have these big hairy dogs and no hair anywhere.  I've got to start taking pictures of the dogs I see walking around on the Upper West Side.  So they've taken poodles into the...  They've made them sex slaves.  Yeah, pretty much.  They abducted them at the malls.  Yeah, because let's be honest.  All these shepherds and Labradors in the waiting room with bath robes on and stuff.  Yeah, let me get that second one over.  I saw one dog where I actually jokingly said, is that thing real? 
[02:08:30]  And the lady had to tell me, yes, indeed, it's a real dog.  Because it looked like a stuffed animal walking down the sidewalk.  And my reaction was, is that real?  Obviously, it's real.  It's walking.  They've always bred the poodle with the other dogs, though.  I've heard some other ones, like a Shih Tzu and a Poodle.  Well, because just having a Poodle is so faggy.  But then you take the Poodle and you mix it with something else.  And then it's kind of like...  It goes from faggy...  Fag is fag.  Yeah, it goes from faggy to like cutesy. 
[02:09:00]  Like a Pit Boodle?  A Pit Boodle.  A Pit Boodle.  But they're fucking with the dogs.  Yeah.  They're really...  It's getting out of hand.  It's getting out of hand what they're doing.  Pit Bull with like a Labrador looks good, though.  Pit Bull with a Labrador.  Buddy might have one out in the lab.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Pablador.  I'm just trying to make it work.  It's got to work in the name or you can't breed it.  See, I was right.  Mongrel class of dog.  There's doodles out there, though. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  But it's not just a doodle.  See, you confused me.  I don't know.  It's a something doodle.  Something doodle, I guess.  Right.  Sure.  Doberman Pinchoodle would be...  Well, that doesn't fit with the doodle.  Well, how would you call that?  A dober doodle?  A dober doodle.  A dober doodle.  That's what it is.  Why not?  These freakish people.  That's the thing you'd describe.  A dachshund with a...  Like, something with real short legs with, like, a Great Dane would be hysterically funny 
[02:10:00]  that it can't even support its own way.  It's like an engorged tick around your house.  That would be hysterical.  It couldn't even look down.  It had to hold its head up or else its nose would have been, like, on the ground.  Yeah.  Because that's funny.  Because it seems like a good idea at the time when you're in the lab and then these  things come popping out and then you're stuck with them.  And you can see it on the dog's face.  It knows it's fucked up.  Like, it's just like, like, gee, thanks a lot.  Little legs, huge body.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Joe, Jersey, what's up? 
[02:10:30]  Hey, Anthony, you think if you mix a hack radio DJ with a poodle, it would be a water doodle?  My water doodle.  This is a mixture of a water and a poodle.  Water the doodle.  A waddle doodle.  That's funny.  Bone dry.  Oh, man, this hurricane is going to hit New Orleans, I'm telling you right now.  They're getting a little nervous in Florida.  No one really hitting the emergency yet, though. 
[02:11:00]  Like, Fox hasn't picked up on it yet that this thing is going to go into the Gulf.  So they're kind of waiting.  But the second this thing passes Florida, boom, Fox News Alert, another hurricane in the Gulf.  You know, if this hurricane hits New Orleans, you've got to start thinking about that sin thing.  Yeah.  You've got to start thinking that maybe that God and sin and stuff, he means business.  Like all their prayers that they've been praying for help now are being answered with another hurricane. 
[02:11:30]  That would be fantastic.  Who isn't looking for it?  I'm sorry.  Are there more hurricanes now than there were in the past?  Yeah.  Where they just hype them up?  Yeah, it's all about that global warming.  Oh, that's such crap.  They've had a lot this season, that's for sure.  But if you look through history, it goes in waves, you know?  Will we get to Z, Anthony?  We're up to R now.  I think we probably will get to Z.  Yeah, then they'll have to start over.  Really?  Another A.  Nice.  I don't know what they do.  They go to numbers or something after that? 
[02:12:00]  Hurricane 1?  How about black girl names?  There you go.  There were people complaining about that.  There was actually a black activist complaining that there weren't enough Afrocentric hurricane names.  Yeah, and then when they do it, then they'll say you're blaming the violence of the hurricane on African Americans.  Exactly.  We can't win.  I was watching a show last night on videotapes, crimes caught on tape kind of thing, and people were talking about it.  And there was this black lawyer discussing the beating of Rodney King and talking about, even taken in context, this is an awful beating. 
[02:12:30]  The cops should have gone to jail, which of course they didn't, and that started the riots.  And when the not guilty verdict came back, he could not believe his ears.  Couldn't believe it.  Then, the same guy is commenting on the Reginald Denny case.  It was an attempted murder case.  Black guy, they dragged him out of the truck, beat the living shit out of him, and another guy took a brick, and as hard as he could, we all remember the footage, threw it at Reginald Denny's head. 
[02:13:00]  Right at his head, and bam, he was down for the count.  But this black guy was defending him, saying he absolutely was not trying to kill this guy.  And because we should take the tape in context and look at it frame by frame, he was saying the same exact thing to them.  I wanted to reach through the screen and punch him. 
[02:13:30]  And choke him.  Oh, my house sounded like a Klan meeting during that segment last night.  Oh, awful.  Larry.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  Hi.  I'm telling you, don't eat fish on Sunday.  He gets delivered on Friday morning.  It just sits there and waits for you.  Then when you get it on Sunday, look what happens.  That is true.  There are days where you should buy fish and some that you shouldn't.  Yeah.  He sounded like he just ate some.  Yeah, but on Sunday, look what happens. 
[02:14:00]  I made a mistake once of ordering a swordfish when I was in Grand Junction, Colorado.  See, that's just dumb.  And I didn't realize I'm from New York.  I realized, you know, when I had gotten it and it got placed in front of me and looked a little off,  I realized I don't see many people reeling in that big swordfish in Colorado.  You know, there's not many big swordfish in Colorado.  You know that we tried to search out a sushi restaurant when we went to the Grand Canyon? 
[02:14:30]  Another thing you should probably just not do.  Although you can probably get things like salmon, though, where there's rivers and lakes.  But swordfish, probably not going to be pulling in the big swordfish that far inland.  And then you know that they're just getting these things and putting them on planes with your baggage and whatnot  and flying them in, but not as fresh as when you live on the coast.  Some of the best sushi I ever got, this girl took me to a place and I was in the middle of Kansas. 
[02:15:00]  Kansas?  And I'm eating her.  This stuff is unbelievable.  Really?  Yeah.  She was Asian, though.  She knew where to go.  She knew where to go for it.  They probably just fly it in fresh.  How many times have you heard that?  That's the best plane.  They fly it in fresh every day.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, Eric in Staten Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to let you know that Pluto thing you saw, it's called a Labradoodle.  And the other hybrid that's out there now is they're mixing a pug and a beagle, and they're calling it a puggle.  A pug and a beetle is a puggle. 
[02:15:30]  We got pictures of puggles on the website right now.  Oh, my God.  It could be the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.  That's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to make dogs into stuffed animals now.  That has passed any level on the adorable meter.  Scroll down.  Oh, stop it.  I'm melting.  And his name is Stitch.  Here's Stitch.  Stitch is adorable.  At 12 weeks, there's old Stitch. 
[02:16:00]  And there's Harley.  What are they called?  Puggles.  Puggles.  Oh, look at Dakota.  I must say, they are adorable.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You got it.  Let's go to Kevin in New Jersey.  Kevin.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, my dad has a faggot dog.  It's a mix between a Cocker Spaniel and a poodle, and they call it a cockapoo.  These have been around for years.  What the fuck's a cockapoo?  Cockapoo. 
[02:16:30]  I remember those from years ago, and I hated the fucking thing.  One of our family's friends had one.  Yeah.  Used to bring it everywhere, and she'd have to tell everyone it was a cockapoo.  Like, it was a big thing.  Like, everyone had a no, and it just had the worst disposition.  Oh, the name is the worst for a dog.  Cockapoo.  Cockapoo.  Yeah, there's cock, poo, and just a little A, hoping to make the whole thing better.  All right, boys.  See ya.  Doesn't work.  I'd love to see the fucking dogs that just, they came out. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, let's breed this and this, and they're just like, ugh.  Just didn't work out.  Never took off.  Gas that one.  Yeah, let's just, uh.  You think they're just gassing the failure?  Yeah.  They didn't just come up with a, what was it, a puggle?  A puggle.  They didn't just come up with a puggle the first time around.  No, there had to be some, yee.  Yeah.  Ooh.  How was work today, honey?  I had a rough one.  Like that thing that came out of the chamber in the fly. 
[02:17:30]  And they tried it the first couple of times.  Lives for, like, two hours.  Yeah.  Flapping around.  Lives for two hours, horrifically.  That one's just called a, holy shit!  Dole.  Let's go to Don.  Don, what's up?  Oh, hey.  Um, hey, man.  I just wanted to say, do you actually think that somewhere in a lab there are breeding poodles  and Rottweilers? 
[02:18:00]  Or do you think somewhere there's a Rottweiler out there that's fucking a poodle?  Or somewhere there's a poor Rottweiler that's got to look back at a poodle rail, or at a  Rottweiler railing it?  No, I think it's all very clinical.  All right.  It was a lot of R's in that last sentence.  And he was shaking his voice.  Do you think that poodle is having sex with her?  Oh, my God.  I don't even punch it out.  I would love to know what goes on in some of these callers' minds.  They call up knowing they have a really good idea, but they didn't think it out before 
[02:18:30]  they call the program.  So sweating.  He pulls the phone away from his ear and just hears...  Plus, this show is like the white Apollo.  It's like people are looking to boo you or just make you fucking bomb.  You know what I mean?  The second it veers just a little into the wrong lane, it's just like, all right, we're  not...  See, the thought was great.  Poodle Rottweiler.  I thought he was going to say maybe there's a Rottweiler out there raping other dogs or  something like that.  That's where I thought it was.  No, he didn't even go there.  He was all shaky.  I'm glad he didn't. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, that didn't work too well.  Yeah, no, it didn't.  Somehow there was enough noise in the room to...  I avoided a little bomb there.  And you had almost blamed it on him, even though he never said it.  I thought he was going to say this lousy line.  See, you guys should only have me in here two days, man.  I'm telling you.  No, you're doing fine.  Stop.  Two-day Billy.  I don't know how Norton does this.  I'm out.  I have no good stories left.  I'm fucking finished.  I'm like making up shit.  I dated a Samoan one time.  I got nothing.  I don't know what you guys want.  Now you know our lives. 
[02:19:30]  You can have some wacky photos in front of me or I got it.  I'm done.  Now you know our lives on a daily basis.  This is what we do.  We walk in here and have to make magic out of shit.  Oh, it's horrendous.  It's called a shit-oodle magic.  Mining comedy out of these two awful papers just like, anybody see the golfer who sat  on the golf tee?  Is there anything funny in that?  Anybody got a clip of that?  Bill, what was your weekend like?  Anything horrific happen to you that can eat up 45 minutes?  It's so true.  We go through these two awful papers just turning the page hoping for that one story that's 
[02:20:00]  radio gold.  Magic.  And you slowly go through the paper going, oh, no, there's only four pages left and we  have nothing.  You hope something in your dull life is interesting enough to elaborate on and bring to the radio.  And meanwhile, you don't do anything.  It's like, what has happened between, you know, you kind of like the weekends because  it gives you an extra few days, but during the week, what happens between Tuesday when 
[02:20:30]  I leave here and Wednesday morning, that ungodly hour that I walk in, that is so thrilling,  so exciting.  I have to share it with a million people or so that I really have to share, that they  really want to hear it.  You're like thumbing through the money section.  Wow, this went into section eight.  Actually, isn't it awful?  You nailed it because some days you just fucking run out.  Some days you just need one paper, the New York Post, you got a million stories, bam.  All right.  Some days you need two.  You need the Post and the Daily News.  Today, you just nailed it. 
[02:21:00]  Not only did I read the Post, the Daily News, the New York Times, I leaped through the USA  today and made it to the money section, hoping there was just some silly tidbit in there  that we could go with.  In the Harrisburg Gazette.  Right.  That was next.  Funny thing can happen here in Harrisburg.  I actually said today, hey, wow, it was in the money section, like, hey, the iPods  are getting smaller.  Yeah.  Hope it.  Don't you do, we do that in the office and you probably noticed, like someone will throw  something out hoping it gets a response.  Yeah.  Oh, Yahoo stock, down a point. 
[02:21:30]  No, then the other person always has to play along like this and it's clearly in both  your eyes that there's nothing there, but you still.  Yeah.  But you never know, so you got to just throw it out there.  Glad I didn't have any.  It's the creative process that the listeners don't get to see.  I actually said that today.  iPod's getting smaller.  They're as small as business cards now.  You could lose it easily.  Those bastards will keep making them smaller.  We'll have to keep buying new ones. 
[02:22:00]  What is next?  An iPod the size of a postage stamp?  All right.  Well, you know what?  But this dog thing, it has little legs.  Oh, legs.  Little legs.  And all I did was say, hey, what's going on with the dogs?  I see a lot of different dogs.  Right.  And now we got all these calls coming in.  Steve, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Hey, my mom actually has a dog that's a Shih Tzu toy poodle mix, and it's called a Shih Tzu-Poo. 
[02:22:30]  A Shih Tzu-Poo?  A Shih Tzu-Poo.  No, it isn't.  It's...  I swear to God, dude.  I've had it...  You go to the pet store, and it says Shih Tzu-Poo.  A Shih Tzu-Poo?  No, you got to look.  They don't sell the pet stores.  You got to get them from a breeder.  Mm-hmm.  Wait.  Actually, Nathaniel has found some links to Shih Tzu-Poo's.  I stand corrected.  I thought it was a Cock-A-Poo.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  Later.  Huh.  It's the A, Anthony.  Bobby...  Ties it all together.  Ties it all together.  The A saves the name.  Bobby, big rigger.  What's going on there, guys?  Hey.  Didn't Jimmy Swann say he owned a Cock-A-Poo when he got done pulling out of that chick's ass? 
[02:23:00]  Da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Aaron from Texas, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know what?  They're giving all these poodle studs all the action, right?  Basically, poodles are non-hyperallergenic.  They don't shed, and people that are allergic to dogs aren't allergic to these hybrids.  So, but I'll tell you what.  Ah. 
[02:23:30]  When you hear that.  So.  So, I'll tell you what.  All right.  What?  Oh, no.  I'm serious.  No, my sister got one of these golden doodles.  That's one you guys haven't mentioned yet.  It's a golden retriever, which is an awesome dog.  And a fucking poodle.  And she got that thing, and two days later, she almost went into cardiac arrest.  That thing was so, so allergenic, it almost killed her.  Oh, the allergies?  I got that thing myself.  Man.  That is just a crock.  So, all the hybrids, just like Steve's car, it's not worth anything.  Yeah.  It's a hybrid dog. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  We're just about ready for the end of this segment.  Right.  Sean on Long Island, go ahead.  Yeah, Paul, I heard they're, uh, uh, oh, damn it.  I heard they're breeding a bulldog in a shit, too.  They're going to name it a bullshit.  All right.  Oh, wow.  I thought this.  You know, Anthony's being really generous about not hitting the car.  It reminds me of those war movies where all the troops are wanting to shoot.  They're like, not yet.  Steady.  Steady.  Hold your fire. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, why aren't you hitting the car crash today?  Uh, to be honest with you, I was really trying hard to come up with some wacky name to call  the dog a shit dick, but I couldn't think of one.  So, I've been shirking my car crash responsibility.  And, um, yeah, all for a bad joke.  Let's go to Joe in Nashville.  Joe?  Yeah, my sister's got what they call a double-dabble dachshund.  And, uh, half of them come out normal.  The other half come out so deformed and fucked up they have to be put down.  Yeah, that's a cute story. 
[02:25:00]  Thanks.  You guys were talking about it.  All right, well, we're looking for doubles trying to defend it.  Hey, you guys are talking about it.  It's not me.  You brought it up.  We didn't ask you to call.  Well, according to Google, there's no double-dabble doc.  Double-dabble.  What?  Double-dabble.  Double-dabble?  Right.  Yeah.  The one that she's got lived, and she's adorable, but all her brothers and sisters are probably  killed.  Well, maybe we're spelling double wrong.  Dabble.  I know.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Eric in Michigan.  Eric? 
[02:25:30]  Hey, yeah.  I was just calling.  You guys sound like the radio equivalent of Seinfeld.  You're making a ten-minute segment about nothing about how you don't have anything to do a  show about.  Oh, I think everyone went there.  I had nothing to pay attention to there.  Hey, so the Emmys.  Star Jones.  That's where we're at.  Right.  Doing the red carpet, if I remember correctly.  Yeah.  How did this get going?  Yes.  Where she lost a lot of weight, but she still has the big head, and we all noticed, and  loft, and loft, and loft.  Yeah.  And she has big bug eyes and stuff. 
[02:26:00]  Yes.  And that's all I have on that.  All right.  That's our Emmy talk today.  Yeah.  Now, she was out there talking to the stars.  She's got some big, what they call a dachshund eyes.  Are they dachshunds with the big eyes?  She's got the puggal eyes.  Basset hound eyes, I think.  Puggal eyes.  Yeah.  They call her a basser.  All right.  Look, Jimmy isn't here, and he just said it.  All right. 
[02:26:30]  Let's see.  You know what?  Oh, God.  We just, I mean, nobody watched it.  No.  Nobody in this room watched it, yet we're going to comment on it like professionals.  Of course we will.  You watch what we come up with.  But the phones are still lit, so let's go to Brent here.  I feel like we're doing a telethon.  Like 24 hours on radio.  Come on.  Keep those donations coming in.  Let's go to the tote.  All right.  Brent, this will determine if we continue with the dog thing or move on to the Emmy thing. 
[02:27:00]  Go ahead, Brent.  All right.  What's happening, boys?  Opie, keep the finger on the car crash for me.  All right.  You're going to take a pit bull, a pug, a Doberman, and Al Roker, and it's going to be called a Pat Battle.  What?  That's the end of the dog bit.  It is so over with that. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  So the Emmys, yeah.  Yeah.  Here's Star Jones.  Did the red carpet.  Now, I read that your father used to be a math teacher.  So, okay, you're the daughter of a math teacher.  What are you like with...  She is the word, by the way, as far as interviewing people outside that dumb View studio.  She just comes across...  Where are you going to go with that?  What?  No, not the joke.  I'm saying like...  I'm saying Star.  Where are you going?  Yeah.  Where is that leading? 
[02:28:00]  So, your dad had a hardware store.  Must have been a lot of rakes around your house as you grew up, huh?  She just looks uncomfortable in her own skin when she's outside that studio.  A lot of it.  That's because she's trying to balance that big head and that tip over on the fucking carpet.  She's talking to Cameron...  Uncomfortable in her own skin because it's held back with scrunchies up her spine.  No?  That would be kind of funny because she's fat and was fat and it was...  Why'd you go with scrunchies?  Because she would hold her loose skin with scrunchies because she's a woman. 
[02:28:30]  I think she has enough money for the surgery.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's stanko.  All right, let's see where this is going.  It's Cameron Manheim and it's Star Jones sounding very, very, very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  Now, I read that your father used to be a math teacher.  So, okay, you're the daughter of a math teacher.  What are you like with numbers, Cameron?  Well, yes, my father's a math... 
[02:29:00]  Holy shit!  Wow.  This was seen by millions and millions of people and you think we're doing a bad job today.  I can't get past that.  Holy shit!  What?  What was she...  You saw that coming too.  You saw that coming early.  That she could...  Had nowhere to go with that.  Well, where else could she go with that?  You said, where could she go with that?  What numbers?  What?  Well, I use them on a daily basis. 
[02:29:30]  Come on, tell the truth.  Do you ever use algebra?  What could she possibly say?  Why do they keep teaching it?  So, you got a new show on TV.  Where is the fucking segue?  Was that lady's life that boring?  They had to get out of her life.  They went to her parents.  The most exciting thing they could find was that she was a fucking math teacher.  He used to be a math teacher.  You know what's great about the fact that none of us watched any of this?  Now we can guess what the answer is.  Oh, wow.  We got a new game.  Was there an actual question there? 
[02:30:00]  Well, she said something about...  What do you...  Yeah.  What's the question?  Oh, of course we want to go back.  Yeah, of course.  It's not a waste of another 12 seconds.  Now, I was just...  I read that your father used to be a math teacher.  So, okay, you're the daughter of a math teacher.  Hold on.  You know, we're all over the...  She's in trouble.  You know, we're all over the place.  Fucking Fox News.  How classic is this?  The Hurricane Rita is going to hit the, what, the Keys or Key West?  And then it's probably going to go into the Gulf, right?  Yeah.  They don't know where it's going to be yet. 
[02:30:30]  They just have no clue what direction it's going to take.  It could be anywhere from...  It's heading towards Houston.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what they show.  People who left New Orleans are so fucking evil, God is following them with hurricanes.  That's what I'm getting at.  But that's fucking Fox throwing that in all our heads today.  Because it could hit anywhere on the Gulf Coast.  But they just showed that it looks like it's going to hit Houston.  Early projections that it's going to hit Houston.  Yeah.  Following those evil people. 
[02:31:00]  Would that be fantastic?  Could you imagine if it hit Houston?  God doesn't care about black people.  Oh, no.  He obviously doesn't.  He's just sending hurricanes like a dog.  Sick them!  Sick them!  Just sending them off.  Is that going to happen now to the Astrodome?  The early prediction is it's heading right toward Houston.  It's just going to be these shit-filled domes all over the country.  Huge toilets.  They're not going to let those refugees in the next town. 
[02:31:30]  No.  We don't want them.  Yeah, you got the plague now.  Travis is getting the audio, so we'll see what they're saying.  But I just saw a map.  And, of course, out of everywhere, it just had Houston and huge letters.  All right.  Let's get back to Star Jones.  So let's find out what the question was.  And we'll try to answer it.  Now, I read that your father used to be a math teacher.  So, okay, you're the daughter of a math teacher.  What are you like with numbers, Cameron?  What do you like with numbers?  What do you like with numbers? 
[02:32:00]  Now, how would you, if you were starring in a show,  how would you tie that fucked up question into hyping your show?  I couldn't.  There is no way to even answer that.  There is no answer to that.  What does that question mean?  How are you with numbers?  Can you be good or bad with numbers?  I guess she's going to say that she's okay with numbers.  I enjoy them.  Especially when I look at the ratings to our show.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:32:30]  You go back right there.  That's it.  I think the joke is here that she's actually bad with numbers,  which is crazy because her father was a math teacher.  Math teacher.  How would you want to bet?  How are you with numbers?  It's Cameron.  Well, yes, my father's a mathematician,  and trying to get the car keys out of a mathematician is not easy.  He's like, so how much do you think it costs me for you to drive a car a mile?  And I'm like, well, I try to figure it out with the gas.  He's like, no, you have to put in wear and tear on the car. 
[02:33:00]  You have to put in the depreciation.  And, of course, my pain and suffering.  I'm like, a wall.  Fuck, if you don't mind.  Hello, exactly.  She really spun that.  That was totally like a set.  Because where would she read that her dad was a mathematician?  You're right.  I should have saw that.  In a million years, no one could have guessed where she was going to go with that.  You don't mind.  Exactly.  You know, most people don't know this, but this one is a big biker chick here.  So do you really have your own hog? 
[02:33:30]  I had a motorcycle for 20 years.  20 years.  But when my son was born, I gave it up.  That's because Milo is the cutest little sweetie.  I just want to eat his face all the time.  I'm surprised there's anything left of him at all.  Okay, now, how do you stop yourself from being the doting mom, Cameron?  That's a problem.  Wait a minute.  Is that a fat joke?  Was that a fat joke on a star?  Did she surprise any's left because Star would probably have eaten her child? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that's great.  Got her back for that stupid math question.  See, and you guys thought we had nothing on the Emmys.  Look how brilliant we are.  That's great.  Wait, so Star said Cameron's kid is so cute that she can eat her face.  She wants to eat her face.  You're a creep.  And then Cameron said, what?  I'd be surprised if there's anything.  It's because babies always get food around their mouth as they're eating.  That must be it.  Hold on.  We've got to go back to this little ditty.  Jeff from Jersey saying she interviews like a 14-year-old girl. 
[02:34:30]  Um, like, don't numbers suck?  Yeah, like, that was the lamest question ever.  All right, hold on.  I like how she tried to sass it up with a little attitude.  Yeah.  Through the little numbers.  So, do you really have your own hog?  I had a motorcycle for 20 years.  20 years.  But when my son was born, I gave it up.  That's because mine was the cutest little sweetie.  I just want to eat his face all the time when I see him.  I'm surprised there's anything left of him at all. 
[02:35:00]  Okay, now, how do you stop yourself from being the doting mom, Cameron?  Because that's a problem.  Unless she was trying to do that cutesy voice, but then she started babbling.  Stop.  It doesn't even make sense.  She looks like one of those overfed goldfish.  You ever see those fucking, those eight-pound goldfish that they have?  Chinese restaurants and some tank.  Oh, yeah.  You could hit it with a spear from 40 yards away.  Oh, I can't wait for the Photoshop tonight, man. 
[02:35:30]  The Photoshop's going to be great on the goldfish.  That's because he's so cute.  She has goldfish eyes.  You just want to take out some A1 sauce and eat them.  You just want to bite him.  You're tenderizing down your goal.  Brian.  Yeah, that's me.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  I just want to say, Star Jones, something about your father being a mathematician.  She did something with a mathematician.  Something about numbers, math.  It's Kim from AP.  She said it was brilliant but hilarious.  Something about math.  Oh, very good. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Going off.  Punch it out.  Cameron Mannheim's baby goes in the cage.  Cage goes in the water.  Star Jones in the water.  Our Star Jones.  Farewell and adieu to your fair Spanish lady.  Saw Star Jones.  Star Jones has black eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  It's when they roar back in that head and you hear that scream.  High-pitched screaming and hollering.  Sometimes Star Jones goes away.  Sometimes she don't go away.  Saw Star Jones eat a rocking chair once. 
[02:36:30]  Swallowed it whole.  Saw 20 celebrities go on the red carpet.  Only seven come out.  Out.  September 9th, 2005.  Saw Cameron Mannheim's baby in the water.  Thought I'd come up, swim up, say hello.  Tapped it on the shoulder.  It just bobbed up like a top upside down.  He'd been bitten it half at the waist.  Star Jones come cruising. 
[02:37:00]  Big bulgy eyes like an oversized goldfish eyes.  All right.  The next clip is Star Jones on the red carpet with James Denton and his wife.  Who's James Denton?  James Denton.  Huh?  Desperate housewives.  Desperate housewives.  Obviously, they asked everyone that she was going to interview.  Give us some wacky antidote and she'll set you up.  That's right.  That's funny because then you always look like you have like fucking ESP. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you know a little something about me.  So, did you ever mow a lawn when it was raining out?  As a matter of fact, I did.  And they just launch into their story.  It's so fucking phony.  I love that on the talk show.  Star, I hear you used to be 900 pounds.  That's right.  Move along.  Well, she works in food once again in this clip.  It's all about the food.  I think we like the steamy relationship that goes on.  Does that bother the wife at home a little bit? 
[02:38:00]  No.  No, not really.  I know it's part of the job and we're rich because of it.  Yeah.  Comparatively, we certainly are compared to where we were.  So, yeah, it's nice to have a good job.  It's a bona fide hit.  I mean, being an ABC cast member herself, so I feel good about that.  Absolutely.  It's been tough.  You know, this is my third ABC show in four years, so we never anticipated this kind of success.  And we're just happy to be here this year.  Now, tonight might be a little nerve-wracking.  Does it make you hungry when you're nervous, or do you tend to eat more when you're nervous? 
[02:38:30]  I'm looking.  I see a little...  We're both starving, so I don't know if it's nerves.  It's the fact that we had to get both kids fed and asleep before we left.  I think that's what happened.  I hear that the bar is open.  I didn't hear about food.  We'll see you later.  Uh-huh.  I know exactly what that means right there.  See, he knows it's bombing.  He's like, all right, see you later.  All right, see you later.  Yeah, he took that out.  Like, I know the bar's open.  Oh, I'm going to make it like I've got to run off to the bar.  See you later.  She just stinks.  She's real bad.  I like the beginning of that first question.  She sounded like a muted trumpet. 
[02:39:00]  She's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wait, now I've got to hear that.  This is the very beginning.  Thank you for stalling.  This will kill another 10 seconds.  I think we like the steamy relationship that goes on.  Does that bother the wife and her little bit?  Clyde McCoy in the Sugar Blues.  My dad has that on wax. 
[02:39:30]  She can't stay down with two babies in her.  Not with two.  Wow.  All right, here's Debra.  34 or 30.  Not 25.  You know how you tell?  You look from her huge bloated head to her big fat ass.  Ever messing.  Star Jones talks about the circle of life.  This should be wonderful.  What's the first thing you want to do the day after Will and Grace goes off the air?  Oh, I want to go to Africa on safari. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  How about that?  Oh, yeah, I'll do that.  I was in Kenya on safari, and it is spectacular to really understand the circle of life.  Yeah.  And see all the little animals.  I would love to do that.  Do you think those in Kenya would have time because you don't have that time to vibe?  That's right.  That's right.  The circle of life.  That's a new thing for, like, celebrities to go over there and sit around a bunch of starving black kids in Africa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go on safari. 
[02:40:30]  They go to a village.  They see the little starving kids.  Then they go out.  They see a giraffe, an elephant come back here and make like they were roughing it.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Star.  I'm surprised that helicopter didn't fire a dart into her ass and tag her ear.  That'd be great.  I don't know what happened.  I felt drowsy.  I woke up, and I had new earrings with numbers on them and a collar that beeps.  Wow.  She stinks. 
[02:41:00]  How long is she going to last on the red carpet?  I don't know.  Who'd she replace?  I don't know.  Joan.  They're trying to do the Joan Rivers thing, obviously, but...  She just ain't got it.  No.  Well, Joan has at least that sense of humor.  Well, at least Joan Rivers is politically incorrect.  I think she stinks, too, but at least she throws some zingers out there once in a while.  Zingers.  Some zingers.  You.  You.  All right.  The actual Emmys.  We can get into this a little bit.  Oh, no more star?  I was kind of digging her.  Do we have any more star, Joan?  That was all we had. 
[02:41:30]  It's too good because she's so awful.  She's so bad at her job.  So completely awful.  I've seen people work it.  It looks like a lame-ass job, but I've seen people work it where it's like, hey, you know,  how's your show going?  How are the kids?  Not threatening to eat your children.  Well, it works.  Hey, Troy.  What, you know?  Hey, you guys are killing me, man.  Why?  Keep it up with this Star Jones shit.  He's such a fat, no-talent ass. 
[02:42:00]  It's not even funny.  Yeah, I kind of like the star.  All right.  We're going to get more Star Jones as we take a listen to some other Emmy highlights.  Ellen DeGeneres was the host.  Ah.  I put it on.  She was walking out on stage with a unicycle and a sparkler.  I don't know what it was referring to.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  That was the real deal?  And she got the big polite laugh like, oh, she's calling back to the other shit that wasn't  funny.  Let's bring on the next presenter. 
[02:42:30]  This is going to be the new thing we do is like these big shows we're supposed to watch  because we're a big talk show.  We just don't watch so then we can guess what happened.  Yeah, I think it's more fun that way.  I bet you Ellen DeGeneres did a little dance number.  Do you think she danced?  I bet she did.  Did she come on and music played and the whole audience got up and danced with her like  on her talk show?  And then she danced to the crowd a little bit, I bet.  Wonderful.  Maybe someone could call up and tell us if that happened.  That would help this bit.  We guess.  And then someone that actually watched the Emmys will call up and say, well, you were right. 
[02:43:00]  We don't even know the answers.  Let's just make up shit.  None of these listeners fucking watch that.  We don't know the answers.  Who sits around and watches that shit?  I used to be a big fan of like award shows, but they just stink.  The VMAs were just horrendous this year.  That might be the end of the VMAs.  It was that bad.  Yeah, they really need to do something to a spice it up and not in a way that they think  is what works. 
[02:43:30]  Like they think they know what's hip.  MTV used to obviously be hip.  Now they do what they think is hip, but it's just the same crap you could see on the Emmys  and the Oscars.  Fernando from Westchester.  Star is so bad, so black.  I'm not going to stand here while you cut that Star Jones open and watch that little  man time kid spill out all over the red carpet.  Bravo.  All right, here's some of the monologue from last night. 
[02:44:00]  I guess I don't have to point out that this is the second time I've hosted the Emmys after  a national tragedy, and I just want to say that I'm honored because it's times like this  that we really, really need laughter.  And be sure to look for me next month when I host the North Korean People's Choice Awards.  That's a funny joke, but...  Is there going to be a disaster there?  There already is.  Is that what she was getting at?  We're starving.  North Korea?  North Korea is a mess. 
[02:44:30]  No one cares, though.  It's because Angelina Jolie hasn't been there yet.  She'll fix it.  Yes.  She'll fly her own little...  And we do care because they got the bomb in.  One kid at a time, she fixes things.  Hey, you know they got with her and said, look, you know, obviously you're going to be  telling some jokes, and we've got to acknowledge that there was a tragedy, and then it'll be  okay to start joking.  About the tragedy?  No, just in general.  Oh, just making jokes in general.  Yeah, because they canceled, like, or postponed the Emmys for 9-11 when that happened. 
[02:45:00]  That's true.  Remember?  Mm-hmm.  Because we couldn't laugh.  We weren't ready to laugh yet.  But this, no one really cared.  All right, here's more from the monologue.  I think the reason that we love award shows so much is because they're exciting.  We don't know who's going to win or lose.  You know what?  I keep hearing myself saying words like winning and losing and awards as if that's what tonight  is about.  Like, somehow winning an award will validate you.  Come on, if you don't win tonight, it doesn't mean you're not a good person.  It just means you're not a good actor. 
[02:45:30]  That's not Faith the Laugh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm kidding.  It just means you're not as good as the other people in that category.  Kidding again.  Winning is not important.  What is important is how you feel about yourself.  And, of course, you're going to feel a lot better about yourself if you win.  She's doing that whole Ellen confused thing.  Ellen confused babbling thing.  She's great at that.  She's great at the confused thing.  Send her, go to Korea and just get the kayak.  Kayak. 
[02:46:00]  Please.  Thank you, Java log.  A kayak.  A kayak.  I was laughing.  I was switching around the channels.  I told you, man.  That's the funniest thing from last week.  I was switching around the channels over the weekend and I saw some kind of ESPN.  They showed some kayaking.  I couldn't stop laughing.  It's like, the kayak.  Just break down the wall.  It's into the side of the house.  Go through those walls with the kayak.  Go through those walls.  Where's our Celine Dion?  Now I've got to hear it.  All in all, it's just another brick in the wall. 
[02:46:30]  We must break it down.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's move on.  Is he still married to that old guy?  It looks like he's made out of wax.  What is his name?  I used to know it because I used to.  Celine.  Oh, it's like something like.  It's some really French.  One word thing.  Gerard.  Like Henri.  Henri, yeah.  It is an Henri, though.  It's Rene.  Rene.  Rene.  My husband, Rene.  And then they had that problem with her getting pregnant.  And he wound up having the prostate cancer or something.  Was it the prostate cancer?  Because his semen is 80 years old. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  He was like her age.  She was 14 when he started like going out with her or something.  Despicable.  The guy should be in jail.  Just bent her over a mixing board after one take.  Take me, Rene.  Just bust through it like a kayak through a wall.  His sperm looks like mustard.  Oh, my God.  I conjured up a nice image. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Here we go.  More of the monologue.  But please don't say you didn't expect it.  You were nominated.  You had a one in five chance.  Oh, I see.  Maybe telling the winners what they shouldn't say.  Yeah.  Let's face it.  Everybody wants to win.  This is show business.  But tonight, let's try something.  Let's just try to put aside our ego, our envy, our jealousy, our judgment.  What am I saying?  That's what got us here.  Why?  She lost me on that joke. 
[02:48:00]  But seriously, I think overall, in the scheme of things, winning an Emmy is not important.  Let's get our priorities straight.  I think we all know what's really important in life, winning an Oscar.  Ah, I didn't see that coming.  Wow.  That's very close.  You blindsided me.  I thought it was going to be another little hurricane thing.  Yeah.  Priorities.  And then she comes across with the Oscar.  That was good.  Well, here you go.  Desperate Housewives, they won something last night.  Have you watched the show?  No.  I haven't. 
[02:48:30]  Ever see Desperate Housewives?  Oh, the actual...  No?  I thought you meant the...  No.  Never.  Never.  Fan?  They're calling the new...  Desperate Housewives?  Guys?  They're calling it the new Sex in the City.  Good.  Well, that makes perfect sense, because I never watched that shit show either.  Oh.  When I watch the commercial...  When the commercials come on TBS now, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, and the music, and  it's like Monday, Tuesday, and they show that slob...  What's her name?  Who's the one with the...  Olivia Nixon?  She's a slob, too.  The whole cast is a slob. 
[02:49:00]  No, the one is...  Who's the slut one?  Kim Cattrall.  Kim Cattrall.  Veranda?  I have no idea.  I don't know, either.  Every line she has has to be because she's a whore.  Right.  Everything she says is whore-related.  Well, what are you going to order?  I'll have the fat cock.  Oh, they're all at the restaurant, and she's going to have the fat cock, because she's a whore.  I get it.  Every word.  There isn't one storyline where she could talk about anything else. 
[02:49:30]  I could drive my girl nuts doing that.  I'd be in the other room, and she'd be watching, and I hated it.  And any time she had a line, after she'd say it, I'd sing, because she's a whore.  And it irritated her at first, and then she knows every fucking line that comes out of  her mouth is somehow related to fucking jumping on a dick, sucking cock, getting it up the  ass, five guys at once, whatever.  Oh, I hate that show.  They were just showing Whoopi Goldberg.  She's still doing the whole sunglass thing, huh? 
[02:50:00]  Really?  I didn't notice.  Where she has the sunglasses, and then she looks over the sunglasses.  Is that her thing?  It's been her thing for many decades now.  I have not paid attention to the likes of Whoopi in years.  Do you remember that little sitcom she had?  The one with the stereotyped guy from the Middle East?  You know what was the worst thing they would do in promos?  Remember the white girl was acting black?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And she's standing next to her in the promo, and the white girl's like, 
[02:50:30]  All this, you know, speaking slang, and then Opie goes, and she's white!  Uh, Opie?  I'm sorry, Oprah.  Oprah, I'm sorry, whoopi.  Whoopi?  Wow.  I'll give you the credit.  You just made the club real.  Congratulations, Bill Burr.  What the fuck did my head go?  I was just like...  I went, Opie, and then I tried to correct it.  I said, Oprah. 
[02:51:00]  It was whoopi.  Your head floated away on a little string.  Yeah.  It just left your body.  I'm not in the best mindset today.  I'm sorry.  We understand, kid.  All right.  All right.  Oh, the dumpy.  That's great.  But I do remember hating the promos for that show.  You can't save it now, Anthony.  I've so fucking butchered it.  I could care less if you're sitting there wallowing in it.  I want to continue it so everyone remembers what you said. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, this is pretty good.  Java log J from whackbag.com.  It's so weird having Desperate Housewives after that extreme home makeover show.  Because you're crying, then you have a hard-on.  Who's crying at the makeover shows?  Maggot.  The extreme home makeover?  Oh, the home makeover where they take the poor family, knock their house down, and build  something nice for them?  They build this ridiculous nice house in the middle of the ghetto?  Yeah.  I think it's hilarious.  Isn't that great?  Because you know after the cameras leave and the crew leaves, it's just a nightmare. 
[02:52:00]  You need 24 hours a day security to keep your stuff.  I thought he meant those makeover shows where they redo people and give them a new nose  and mouth and stuff.  That's what he thinks of me.  He wouldn't get a hard-on over our house.  Yeah.  So what are you talking about?  Exactly right.  He's trying to put the bomb on him now.  Yeah, Opie.  What the fuck's up with that?  You wouldn't get a hard-on watching the home makeover show.  Yeah, how'd you come up with that?  That was pretty stupid.  It's so weird having Desperate Housewives after that extreme home makeover show, because 
[02:52:30]  you're crying, then you have a hard-on.  So he's watching the home makeover, and he's happy for the poor people.  No, he's crying.  He's crying out of happiness, and then it's right there on the page, Opie.  Read it.  And then Desperate Housewives comes on, and he has a hard-on.  Yeah.  What?  Because he wants to jerk off to the...  The hot milfs.  Yeah.  Are they milfs?  I don't know.  Did I miss it? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, he says watching after extreme makeover.  See, it's weird having Desperate Housewives after extreme makeover.  That's what I said!  Because you're crying, then you have a hard-on.  But the way he has it, you read Desperate Housewives first, and then you read extreme makeover.  But the word after...  After is in there.  ...brings it all together.  Java Log J from Whackbag.  You're confusing everybody.  Oh, Eric has done his...  Eric has done his prep today.  He handed me a paper. 
[02:53:30]  Mr. 100 G's.  What are you handing me?  Uh-oh.  We're talking about the extreme makeover?  What?  Oh, boy.  The extreme makeover thing.  Yeah, what about...  I thought that was the story you were talking about.  No, no, I thought you said, Spider, I need the extreme makeover.  I thought, Spider, you're okay, Spider.  Extreme Tragedy, this story from yesterday's paper, the paper that had your picture in it.  Oh, flip it over.  No, it's not in there.  No, it's the other page, because it's page three. 
[02:54:00]  Eric was on page...  What page were you on?  Page two.  Page two.  In the Sunday Daily News.  Ooh.  Extreme Tragedy, Ugly Mom sues ABC for nixing makeover.  Ugly Mom?  Los Angeles.  The producers of extreme makeover promise the lease, Williams, a Cinderella-like fix for  a deformed jaw, crooked teeth, droopy eyes, and tiny boobs that would transfer her life  and destiny.  But when the ABC reality show dumped the Texas mom the night before the life-changing plastic 
[02:54:30]  surgery...  Oof-ah.  Oh, that's got to suck.  That's a little rough.  It shattered her family's dream and triggered her sister, Kelly McGee, suicide.  Oh.  Oh, Pete.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Why did they bail?  Why did they bail last night?  Did they say why?  Well, there's another...  Is that a picture of her?  There's another, like, two columns to the story. 
[02:55:00]  Let me see.  I've got to see her picture.  All right.  Is that her right there?  That's not the one who killed herself.  The sister, who was actually good-looking, killed herself because...  But this is the one that wanted the makeover?  Yeah.  Wow.  Uh, couldn't live with the fact that her horrible, uh, thing that hurt her sister, uh, the sister  fell to pieces, overdosed, overdosed on pills and alcohol.  Let's see.  She's hurt and humiliated.  Um.  So she killed herself?  She won't even go out?  Yeah.  Over her sister's pain?  Yeah.  Over her sister.  Over her sister's ugliness. 
[02:55:30]  So now her sister has to deal with all that pain and the fact that her other sister's  now dead.  Yeah.  That was a stupid move.  Williams was alone in Los Angeles hotel room reading her pre-op instructions when a producer  showed up, dashed her dreams of her new life with a pretty face.  Uh, you will not be getting an extreme makeover after all.  Nothing.  It doesn't fit in our time frame.  You'll have to...  And you will remain ugly.  Yes.  You will stay ugly.  I hope they...  I hope they...  That's a real reality show. 
[02:56:00]  I hope they fucking tape the fact that they're telling her she's not going to get the makeover  and throw that on TV.  You want a hit show.  You will have to go back to Texas tomorrow, the suit alleges she was told coldly.  But why did they say no to her?  Um, still scanning, scanning.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Some people are just beyond help.  That is...  They probably...  The plastic surgeon probably looked at it like, ah.  Nope.  Can't do that one.  They found someone that was uglier.  Uh, in McGee's taped interview, she tried to play up her sister's good points, but the  hard-nosed producers peppered Kelly with questions about her childhood and her ugly sister 
[02:56:30]  and repeatedly put words in her mouth.  So I guess as they tape the pre-thing, they like the family to talk about how ugly the  person is so that when they come out as the swan, everything's fine and dandy.  To please the producers, the mother-in-law also laid it on thick.  She said things like, I never believed my son would marry such an ugly woman.  Jesus Christ.  Scumbags.  The comments never aired on TV, but Williams, who was also in an adjoining room, heard them 
[02:57:00]  all.  The experience ruined her family life.  McGee's guilt was overwhelming for some of the things she had said, and that's why she  OD'd four months after the producers sent her packing.  These programs are cheap to produce, there are no actors or screenwriters to pay, but they're  very high in human cost.  And nothing, no, uh, they just said it didn't fit their time frame.  They found someone uglier. 
[02:57:30]  You've seen this picture, my friend?  Yeah, I see that.  She looks like a good candidate, though.  Like, they could puff that jaw out, hack her nose, pull her hair down.  I don't know.  There's a few things they could do to her.  All right.  All right, so we got the Desperate Housewives on stage.  Pull their hair down.  And, um, they're presenting an award at the Emmys last night, and they tried a Groucho joke.  They tried a Groucho joke.  And by the way, there's only one hot chick on that show, too. 
[02:58:00]  Who?  The youngest one.  Uh, the brunette?  The one with the dark hair.  Eva?  Yeah.  She's all right.  What about Terry Hatcher?  Terry Hatcher's...  She used to be hot.  She used to be.  She's getting a little, you know...  That redhead with the Botox face is horrendous.  Horrendous.  There are these women...  It looks like a glazed donut smashed her in the face.  Yeah, there's this makeup that older women are using now.  It's this shine makeup.  It's supposed to make their face look like a sheen. 
[02:58:30]  And it just makes them look oily.  And then...  It's like an oily look.  And then there's that...  That...  The Botox and the lips and everything.  It gives you a permanent duck bill look.  What about Nicolette Sheridan?  That's her.  That's the one we're talking about.  No, he's...  Bill's talking about the redhead.  And Nicolette Sheridan's got red hair?  No.  Who is she?  She's the blonde.  Ah, she's another one.  I saw her in one of those...  Strutting around all hot and she's old.  One of those celebrity magazines walking the beach in Malibu in a bikini looking really nice. 
[02:59:00]  Stop it.  Sorry.  Stop it.  Terry Hatch is cute, kind of, but...  If you're 40 and just try to be 40, you can look good looking.  So when you're 40 and you're wearing shit that a 22-year-old would wear...  Uh-huh.  You start seeing their skin has lost the elasticity.  Yeah, it's sort of becoming translucent.  Yes.  You need a blazer at that age.  Something to cover this stuff up.  And you can still look good, you know?  Right.  You know?  Some kind of smart outfit, you're saying. 
[02:59:30]  There you go.  Some smart business suit.  With a sensible shoe.  Right.  Not slut wear.  And then, like we were talking about before, don't try to come off all, you know, like sex  in the city.  You're an older broad.  Be happy about the sex you're getting, but not in the restaurant talking about all the  cocks you're eating.  Your musty vagina.  Still got dirt in it from Woodstock.  You're not...  Because you know at that age, it's starting to fall a little. 
[03:00:00]  It's not tight like those little neck clams.  Hello, Drew.  You know?  Looks like one of those that have been in the buffet a little too long.  A little discolored.  You ever see that girl at the gym?  Like the 48-year-old just fucking on that treadmill right next to the 20-year-old hottie and probably  just had some McDonald's?  She's just trying to fucking hang in there.  It's just like, lady, it's over, okay?  Just try to hang in there.  Stop.  Accept it.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Just holding on by our nails.  Just trying.  Time's a fucking bitch.  Everyone's got to deal with it.  Just deal with it.  Can I play the Desperate Housewives club here?  Oh, is that where we were?  They're presenting and they try a Groucho joke.  I can't believe we actually got down for it.  We did.  What is the secret to success on television?  Adultery with the gardener.  Blirting with the pharmacist.  Sexually explicit car washing.  Popping pills. 
[03:01:00]  And that was just in a limo on the way over here.  Wait, wait.  You got a limo?  Yeah.  And the nominees...  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Clunk.  Oh, they addressed it.  They addressed it.  That's not bad.  Wow, yeah.  Wow.  That's not bad because they addressed it.  You know, they're probably reading it like, oh, my God.  Yeah, this is really bad.  Because that girl didn't even commit to the Groucho thing.  No.  She went halfway through it.  Sounded like, that's some kind of sick joke. 
[03:01:30]  It didn't even sound like Groucho.  When are they going to realize that format is so done with the award shows where they just write this shit for you?  Hey, I knew Groucho.  I hung out with Groucho.  And, lady, you are no Groucho.  All right.  Well, this was the highlight of the Emmys last night.  Highlight.  Tonight, we're doing something that has never been done before on the Emmys.  We call it Emmy Idol.  Oh.  Throughout the evening, we'll have performances of four of the most popular TV theme songs in TV history.  Sung by some of your favorite TV stars. 
[03:02:00]  And by the end of the night, you'll get to vote for your favorite performance at CBS.com or text message.  And crown the very first or possibly the last Emmy Idol.  She sounds nervous.  Now to kick off the competition, here to sing the theme from Green Acres, please welcome Donald Trump and Will & Grace's Karen Walker.  Uh-oh.  Strap in.  It stinks, and I don't like it. 
[03:02:30]  It's written out so far and wide.  Keep Manhattan.  Just give me that countryside.  Oh.  This is so bad.  This would have bombed in the 30s. 
[03:03:00]  The chores.  The whores.  Fish hair.  Pubic hair.  You are my wife.  Oh.  A big applause coming up.  Oh, yes.  The Donald, for God's sake.  Wow.  That guy just wants to be famous so bad.  He doesn't give a shit how stupid he is.  Is he still building things like he's supposed to? 
[03:03:30]  Isn't that what he does?  What?  Oh.  That is so awful.  I saw a picture of it in the paper.  They're dressed up.  He's dressed up in the coveralls, and he's got a pitchfork and the hat and everything.  Who pitched that?  And then they just said, yeah.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Sounds good.  Or like the girl in Will and Grace.  She doesn't have to do that.  She's a fucking zillionaire.  No.  It's, show is over.  Do you want to sing the theme to Green Acres with Donald Trump?  You know what?  I don't. 
[03:04:00]  No.  No, I don't.  I'd like to try to have a career after the show is off the air, maybe going to movies.  Who passed on that and sat in the audience with their dignity and watched that and said,  Jesus Christ, that could have been.  And it's like looking at a train wreck that you crawled away from that could have been  me with all the bodies.  You missed the train.  Yeah.  You missed the train.  I just missed it.  Who else was singing?  Weren't there some others?  Yeah, there's a bunch of others.  But first, there was this.  Wow.  It's so complicated, isn't it?  Surgery.  Hi.  I'm sitting here with Bruce Burmester, and this is how we find out if we're on time, 
[03:04:30]  if we're over time, if we're under time.  It's called a back timer, and Bruce does this.  How are we doing on time, Bruce?  Well, right now, we're four minutes and 11 seconds long.  Four over.  Oh, that's not good.  No, it's not good.  No.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  We don't have time for this.  We've got to move on.  Oh.  Wow.  You know what? 
[03:05:00]  The orchestra on that show should have been just playing Kazoo.  This show is highlighting all the big talent in TV.  Oh, of course it is.  It just looks so ridiculous.  All right.  Who's that?  Who cares?  But who sang it?  Kristen Bell from UPN's Veronica Mars doing the fame thing. 
[03:05:30]  We don't want to get into it.  Who?  Exactly.  Who cares?  Why is that clip on there?  Just because it's a clip.  It sounds like she was actually doing the song Justice, which isn't funny at all.  Yes, Stan?  Yes?  That's an E-Rock selection.  He did the ceremony itself.  E-Rock.  Well, now it's making perfect sense.  He probably has it burnt to his CD for his own use.  Fame!  He probably enjoyed it so much he wanted everyone else to enjoy it. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Guys, you're going to love this.  He has the worst music taste ever.  He stinks.  Who was he enjoying?  He got all the money to get a big sound system for his car.  Oh, yeah.  So we can all listen to it.  Oh, he's going to...  Who was he listening to that he knew all the songs?  Paula Abdul.  Paula Abdul.  He's a big Paula Abdul fan.  He'll probably hear a second album, too.  Yeah.  Right.  Shut Up and Dance.  Was it no hits?  Where is E-Rock?  Here he comes.  Fame!  I'm going to be in the paper. 
[03:06:30]  Still not smiling.  I want to find that DVD.  I want to find that DVD with all the Paula Abdul music videos like that one with the cartoon  dog or whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  Whatever the hell it is.  Which one was that called?  What song is that, Paula Abdul with the cartoon cat?  Opposites Attract.  Faggot.  You are.  Why did you throw the fame clip on here?  I gave you everything.  If you didn't want to go to it, you don't have to go to it.  All right.  Should we go to the long David Letterman tribute to Johnny Carson audio? 
[03:07:00]  It's four minutes if you really want to sit this out.  What about Everybody Loves Raymond Cast?  That one wasn't too bad.  It's got to be pretty dull, though, right?  Yeah.  What are they doing up there?  They're trying to riff on about a spinoff coming.  It's great to be here together again.  And now we have to be funny now.  I don't like presenting because there's pressure that you have to try to be funny because you want people to laugh and then they'll watch your show.  But, if you think about it, we don't have that pressure tonight because we don't have a show. 
[03:07:30]  No more.  Well, you know, we should try to be a little funny because there may be a spinoff.  That's an inside joke.  Untitled Brad Garrett project.  Congratulations.  Yes, the spinoff.  Thank you.  By the way, good luck if that does happen.  Thank you.  And if you need the brother to make a guest appearance, I'm more than happy to help you. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  We're going to recast that.  You know, you should hire somebody who could kiss.  Still no tongue.  It's not that funny, Doris.  Doris, you can tell.  What are you laughing at?  Andy, I've been drunk since the wrap party. 
[03:08:30]  They're ruining the whole image of those characters.  Who are you?  This was the biggest show on TV.  Well, did you ever watch it?  No.  Are you a fan?  No.  Actually, when it reruns, yeah, some of it I like.  Some of it I actually do like.  I can't be bothered with the sitcom anymore.  No?  After Seinfeld, no.  Done.  I watched the same Seinfeld 80 times. 
[03:09:00]  80 times.  Because it's on a million times on every channel that runs.  And I'll watch it.  I don't care how many times I've seen them.  It's on 10 times a day.  I will still watch it.  Easily 10 times a day.  There are some episodes I swear I had to have seen, no exaggeration, 20 times.  And I'm still watching them.  And laughing.  No joke here.  I'm just that crazy.  Here's more Emmy audio.  Patrick Dempsey bombing on stage. 
[03:09:30]  Earlier tonight we saw Zach Ruff here from Scrubs and Hugh Laurie from Pals.  And now we're here with our show.  And it's nice to see at the Emmys we still have universal health care.  Yes, that went over very well, didn't it?  I guess that's a new thing to acknowledge the bad comedy, huh?  Yeah.  What was the Jon Stewart thing about?  Where's E-Rock?  I guess it's not their fault.  I mean, you've got shitty writers writing the shit.  But why do we...  I don't know.  Oh, there's E-Rock. 
[03:10:00]  One, two, three, four.  Oh, I lost count now.  Hey, there he is, E-Rock.  Yeah.  E-Rock has music now when he enters the studio.  Thanks to Derek in the other row.  Yeah, E-Rock.  John Stewart is doing his own TV edit.  They asked him to pre-record a piece and they have somebody else insert his voice over some  of the comments that John makes because the FCC is cracking down. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  What?  Just listen to it.  No, we will not listen to it.  We will move on.  Hey, do you have that remix for Cold-Hearted Snake?  You were supposed to sell the clip.  Now we don't want to hear it.  Okay, then don't.  Or do we?  It was like he did his TV edit.  There's a pre-recorded thing that he...  Like, I couldn't understand what the hell you were trying to say.  Jesus. 
[03:11:00]  Chewing gum.  He's got money now.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's got F.U. money, they call it.  We're all very happy that you're finally chewing gum, but do you have to chew it so loud?  Listen to the replay.  It's unbelievable.  That's all you hear.  This gum was wrapped in solid gold.  Anyway.  The Jon Stewart bit.  They said because of FCC crackdown, they asked him to pre-record his segment, and then they  put in mock TV edits over stuff he was saying.  Oh, I got it.  I got it. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Because he's so wild.  Hi, Jon Stewart.  I want to take a moment to talk about Hurricane Katrina.  There were many stories of heroism and courage, but there's something I'd like to say to the  government officials in charge.  Thank you.  You.  All of you.  See, the thank you.  Oh.  I guess originally he said fuck you.  I get it.  Let's see.  This is radio, so it's not as obvious to pick up on that.  Thank you.  All of you.  Local.  State.  Local and state. 
[03:12:00]  The most confident, acceptable, shockingly epped response ever.  The hero.  Peen the head, Michael Brown.  He didn't know people were stranded at the convention center.  Turn on the television and watch.  Two and a half men every Monday on CBS.  Brown quit.  But what he really deserved.  To be given delicious fruit, sliced straight from the vine.  It's not just him.  The whole organization.  I mean.  Oh, boy.  So I take it back, because that's an insult to the mentally challenged. 
[03:12:30]  So to the Democrats.  Let's see.  I have a little something for you.  Boop.  Oh.  To the administration.  I think there might be something here.  Can't hear it?  Perhaps I could turn it up.  I get it.  And George Bush hits black.  Sabbath. 
[03:13:00]  And E-Rock just leaves.  And he leaves us to clean up this mess.  That's always good to have a four-minute audio of a visual joke on the radio.  Did E-Rock say just play it?  So we play it.  Just play it.  He's long gone, and now we have to sit here and clean this up and make this into something.  Is there a guest coming in today?  I wish I had his job.  It's so easy.  Just play it.  I wish I was the just play it guy. 
[03:13:30]  I'd walk in there once in a while and go, just play it.  Holy shit.  Let me see.  He's got money now.  He didn't have this attitude when I was here Thursday.  No, he's changed.  He's changed him already.  All right, well, here's William Shatner and Frederica Vaughn's stage singing the Star Trek song.  Oh, the lost words to the Star Trek song.  Is that what they did?  Yeah, there were some words to this that I don't know if Gene Roddenberry or Gene Roddenberry's wife wrote or something. 
[03:14:00]  But, yeah, ask any Trek geek, and he'll know that there are words to the Star Trek song.  And William Shatner is going to sing it here?  And I do believe on an album somewhere is Lieutenant Uhura singing the Star Trek theme.  Space.  Space.  Space.  The final frontier.  These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. 
[03:14:30]  He plays it up now.  It's a five-year mission.  To explore strange new worlds.  To seek out new life and new civilizations.  To boldly go where no man...  Man.  ...has gone before.  Oh, Jesus.  No words. 
[03:15:00]  Just her singing the theme then.  That's got to be pretty hard.  That's got to be pretty hard.  Last notes of Doozy. 
[03:15:30]  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  Gee.  What was that all about?  That's the end of the track.  Is that Iraq?  Yeah, he messed up.  Iraq again?  Oh, here he comes back in studio. 
[03:16:00]  What's up, Iraq?  Did he just talk?  Why don't you make us play that Jon Stewart clip?  That would be the worst.  And then you walk out and go, you say, just play it, and then you leave.  I gave you every...  Do you think we're that good?  We're not that good.  Tony, it's the money.  He pounded his fist down, too.  Just play it.  Just play it, stupid.  I gave you everything for you to decide what you wanted to play and what you didn't.  If you didn't listen to it ahead of time, I don't know what to tell you.  Oh, I don't know what to tell you.  What is that supposed to mean? 
[03:16:30]  Jesus.  That's a dig at you right there.  Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?  You never say, I don't know what to tell you to people.  That means you fucked up.  He didn't.  And if you think he did, I don't know what to tell you.  I know what to tell you.  Oh, Nathaniel sits there for a while now.  I kind of like a fan there.  I sure do.  You know what?  I have a question.  I ask it.  Fan grabs the mic.  Answer.  That's right.  It's not still typing.  The mic isn't there.  Here's something.  And then what? 
[03:17:00]  What, Eric?  What?  I kind of like that.  And he's not getting a big head where he needs his own walk-on music every time he comes  into the studio.  Is there anything else we should be playing from the Emmys?  Nah.  I think you're pretty much done.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  And there he goes.  Z-Rock.  He's now got his own music.  Jesus Christ.  There he goes.  Oh, what awful music to have is your music.  I love it.  That is so bad.  Don't you forget that, Derek. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bravo to Derek today.  Z-Rock's walk-on music.  And Derek loves the fact that he can fuck with him like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, come up with your music.  Yeah, this is your music now, asshole.  All right.  We have more Star Jones.  We're going to attempt to save this Emmy discussion segment with some more Star Jones.  I kind of liked it.  We started strong with the Star Jones.  It started good.  It kind of went good and then kind of tapered off with the clips. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, that full-minute visual.  Yeah, that really fucked it up.  The Jon Stewart thing.  It's horrible.  All right, here we go.  Should I start?  Talking to Ray Liotta.  You are with Ray Liotta.  What's up?  I am here with Ray Liotta right now.  And he's already won his Emmy last week.  Right, Ray?  Yes, I won it.  Okay, so here's the deal.  No pressure on you tonight.  No pressure.  What does that Emmy feel like in your hand?  You know, I don't know.  I haven't felt it yet because I was at the Toronto Film Festival, so I wasn't able to make it. 
[03:18:30]  So hopefully I'll get it today and I'll feel it.  And you're presenting this evening.  Yes, for Best Director in a Drama Series and Best Writing in a Drama Series.  Well, see, that's what everybody is familiar with you is the dramatic role.  And you have a new film coming out, Revolver.  Is it Guy Ritchie's movie?  Yeah, Guy Ritchie, right.  Absolutely.  So are you excited about the new film coming out?  No.  A little trepidation?  Oh, no, no.  Very excited.  So it's the Toronto Film Festival.  I love that.  I love what I saw.  I got another movie coming out called Slow Burn, so things are good. 
[03:19:00]  Slow Burn sounds like one of those Ray Liotta movies where somebody's going to get shot.  Yeah.  No, it's just a little different for me.  A little different.  Oh.  Well, I got news for you.  We'd like to see you as much as you want to be seen.  Yeah, well, that's great.  That's what our job is, to let everybody know, Ray Liotta's a good time tonight.  Okay, thanks.  Holy crap.  What an idiot.  Wow.  She...  Are you excited about the movie coming out?  Uh, no. 
[03:19:30]  Do you hope it makes money?  Do you want it to end your career?  Oh, God.  How are you supposed to, when you're interviewing, you don't ask, like, yes or no questions?  Right.  So someone just goes, yes.  Right.  Holy crap.  Was it fun to make that kind of money?  She sounds like that girl, trim star, baby.  You like my body?  Oh, and then Nicole Smith. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, yeah.  She is horrid.  She did not know what to ask.  Excited about the new movie?  Of course he is.  Mm-hmm.  Phew.  All right.  That's the only Star Jones we have?  Uh, we have one more.  Waiting for, uh, what?  We're not waiting for anything.  It's, uh...  Oh.  Jesse Metcalf of Desperate Housewives.  Uh-huh.  Um, yeah, so this is Star Jones on the red carpet. 
[03:20:30]  Uh, and we're gonna play that in a second here, but first, uh...  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, back in the studio.  What's going on?  Yeah, I never would have known.  Thank God he has music.  What's going on?  I don't know.  I got called in here saying you were looking for something.  What?  Nathaniel called me and said you were looking for something.  No, we weren't, we're in the middle of our Emmy talk. 
[03:21:00]  We didn't need you anymore.  Yeah, we finally got going and you interrupted it.  As opposed to when we were playing the clips that you had brought in.  Right.  Uh, we're playing the Star Jones clips now.  Yeah, we don't really need you at all.  I don't think we needed your help.  Okay, then.  Nathaniel was, uh, mistaken.  All right.  See you later.  During that whole mess, I go to Nathaniel. 
[03:21:30]  Just tell Eric that we need him in the studio.  Of course.  So we can keep playing that.  I'm the worst liar ever, too.  I was, I, I don't know why he came in here.  Because I just said, Ope's looking for something.  And when he said what, I was like, I don't know.  I don't know.  You know what's so funny?  He, he tries so hard to not walk to the beat of that song.  Because you don't want, it's bad enough that you're walking to that song,  which is now your music.  But you don't want to dun, dun, dun, dun, and walk to the beat of it.  So he breaks stride every so often. 
[03:22:00]  Got a little hurt to his, uh, walk.  He doesn't want to look like he's even acknowledging it's playing, so.  Oh, is that funny?  In his blood.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, Jess or Jesse Metcalf of Desperate Housewives.  So Jesse Metcalf, I have to say, you are the envy of all the young men in America.  I don't know.  I don't know what to say to that, you know?  Don't hate the player, hate the game.  Yeah, exactly.  So for the young women out there, who would tell me if I didn't ask,  is there anybody that's in your life right now? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm seeing, I'm seeing someone actually, uh,  Courtney.  She's with me here tonight.  Is that that beautiful lady right there?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So you're taking me off the market?  Oh, you know, you know how it is.  We're, uh, we're, we're, we're, you know, we're dating,  just getting to know each other, you know,  kind of having a good time together.  Well, that's all that's expected.  But yeah, for right now, for right now, I'm off the market.  And so the Desperate Housewives are out there thinking that, uh,  life can imitate art.  Sorry.  Not about Jesse, but Mrs. Robinson. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Absolutely.  Good luck for you and your cast.  Appreciate it.  Have fun.  What was happening?  No business being on the right now.  It's not like the, ah, ah.  She squawked.  She's playing musical instruments like Bill Burr pointed out.  Well, that was just, um, I don't know, an hour of riveting radio.  Yes, it was.  It was absolutely terrific. 
[03:23:30]  Bobby in Texas.  What's up, Bobby?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, there, Bobby.  Hey.  Hey, man, have you guys noticed that every time you turn on Comedy Central,  there's one of your bits being done?  I mean, you got Carlos Mancia doing all you guys' stories that you do when he's on your show.  Fucking Adam Carolla does what did we learn at the end of his fucking show.  Mama.  Oh.  Ripping me off, Robin.  What do you mean Carlos Mancia is doing, ah, stories?  How dare a comedian tell stories on TV. 
[03:24:00]  Do what?  What is Carlos Mancia doing?  He's doing all your beaner stories.  They camped out underneath the shitter up there in Maine or wherever it was.  Did you guys get it when he was on your show?  Mama.  I'm punching out, bitches.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Idiot.  That was like one of those accidents you saw on Chips. 
[03:24:30]  It was always like a 52-car pileup, and then there was always that last asshole who didn't  see all 52 cars, and he flies over it, and his foot is still on the gas if you listen to  the old lady, the black guy.  Yeah, who is the idiot that's the last guy in on one of those? 
[03:25:00]  If you're watching this, his foot is still on the gas.  That's the sound effect they have.  All right.  Wonderful.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know. 
[03:25:30]  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  What is this?  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not that against the devil.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee Diva. 
[03:26:00]  Coffee Diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  I got to wait until the day.  Yeah, I know.  We'll definitely get to it.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.P. and Anthony auction.  A lot of items going away today.  Go to opiananthony.com to see what else is, well, what's still up there for bids and stuff. 
[03:26:30]  Of course, helping out the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Anthony's NBC jacket only has 12 minutes left.  Wow.  That's my NBC jacket from the XFL game day days.  That's right.  Well, that's a very famous jacket, too.  Yes.  What happened?  XFL game day.  It's just fucking XFL.  It's awful.  I know.  It was horrible and we were part of it.  Oh, you guys were? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  Please, I'm sorry.  We did the pregame show.  We did the pregame show on NBC.  NBC.  That was our only shot at national TV.  At what point did you realize that it wasn't going to take off?  Before we even taped the first one, I knew.  But they gave Anthony a jacket, so Hank goes, all right, now that you gave me an NBC jacket,  yeah, I'll do this.  Yeah, that was pretty much the deal.  I blame it on you.  The deal closer.  Did you get to meet Vince McMahon?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  Vince McMahon.  Wonderful guy.  You're fired.  They just didn't have their shit together, man. 
[03:27:30]  No, they kept calling us up.  Here's what they had.  They had this image of a pregame show for XFL.  XFL was thrown together, man.  They really didn't know what the fuck they were doing, and that's obvious.  So their image for this pregame show was, let's get a couple of wild hosts, because  this XFL is so wild.  We got chicks and cheerleaders.  No holds barred.  In your face.  Smash them football.  No fair catches.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  No fair catches.  You catch it, you're getting your fucking ass handed to you.  It's outrageous.  I'd love to continue, but someone just watched.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, why are you walking into the studio?  What's up, E-Rock?  Anthony's in the middle of the XFL story.  What, what, what, what?  What happened?  I was told to come in here to give you an update on the eBay auction.  What did we say?  All right, come in here.  We're in the middle of telling the XFL story.  I know.  Did we really need an update?  I think Opie was doing a great job of updating the auction, saying what time was left on things. 
[03:28:30]  There's a guy outside the studio.  You'll bring him in in a few minutes.  Could Anthony continue with his story?  Thank you.  All right, see you later.  This is just radio hazing.  Hazing by radio.  Yeah, it is.  So, XFL.  Yes.  Wild hosts.  They had some image that they wanted this wild hosts and everything, but then they had the sports angle, too, so they wanted a sports caster that had some credibility, and then they had one of the coaches from one of the teams, and all brought together into the pre-game show. 
[03:29:00]  This was going to be a half-hour show that aired before the game.  So they approached us way in advance.  You want to do this, guys?  And we're like, no.  There's no way.  I personally know zilch about sports in general.  As far as XFL goes, I know nothing about this.  I couldn't name a player if you asked me.  So they wanted you to actually talk about football? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, like, that was part of it.  They interviewed these guys that weren't good enough to be in the NFL, basically.  But when they approached us with it, they said, no, you don't have to know shit about this.  That's not your job.  We got the sports guys.  You guys are just going to be throwing it to people and talking to the cheerleaders and, you know, just being wild.  Getting the crowd pumped for the games.  Getting the crowd pumped.  So what this was was a live event every week.  We would tape a live event.  So they needed an audience is what they needed.  The crowd pumped.  You ready for the kickoff? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  So what they needed was a live audience.  And they figured we could bring that to the WWF down there in Times Square to tape this thing every week.  So we would.  We would bring huge amounts of our listeners down there who were just animals.  Animals.  Animals.  Animals.  Animals could not take direction.  There's a director trying to tell them, all right, now, when Opie and Anthony come out,  fuck your mother's cunt, you mother.  No, when O and A come out.  These are like professional sports producers and stuff trying to make this work.  So here's me and Opie now who do, we've done road shows. 
[03:30:30]  We get up on stage.  We bring girls out to show their tits.  The crowd goes crazy.  We show them members of the show.  The crowd goes nuts.  Things like that.  We talk about the show.  Now we're wearing earpieces with directors going, okay, introduce Rusty, the sports guy,  and then throw it to this, and we're sitting there lost like puppets whose strings don't work.  We're totally lost.  We have our audience out there now laughing at us, just going, you fucking dick. 
[03:31:00]  You suck.  Like you flub a line and go, all right, yeah.  Well, we got an interview coming up.  All right, cut.  Redo that.  Anthony, can't you talk, you fucking cock?  It was the worst experience ever.  It was supposed to only take like an hour.  They thought in and out, no problem.  The guys get there, we'll record.  It's a half-hour show, but it'll only take an hour.  Three, four hours later, it's now midnight. 
[03:31:30]  We're exhausted.  We're still freaking doing the taping.  They did real stage makeup, like TV makeup, where they sat in a chair, and the makeup woman  would take out that thing.  Remember that thing she used on us?  Yeah, then.  It was like an airbrush thing.  Yeah, that just...  Oh, you're like orange?  Yeah.  Just spray the orange on your face.  You're orange.  And then you walk out there.  We got the earpieces, a couch, and they would go, and we would say, we told them well in  advance, we go, we're not going to do this thing, because we don't know what the fuck 
[03:32:00]  you want from us.  Don't worry, you'll have writers, you'll have this.  We get there day one for the show.  What do you guys want to do?  Wait, wait, what do you guys got planned?  You're taping this shit, right?  Yeah, what do you got planned?  Nothing.  We just did a radio show.  We're here taping.  What?  We brought an audience.  Right.  What do you want from us?  So...  And go.  So we pulled off the first week.  We really did it after many hours.  It wasn't great.  It wasn't bad. 
[03:32:30]  It was just kind of there, right?  This is where it gets really funny, and I knew we were fucked.  Yeah.  I go to NBC, because they're now putting the whole thing together, and I want to see the  process, right?  So I walk into the editing room, and what's his name's over there?  Yeah, our guy.  Our guy there, Pete Radovich, who's a very talented guy.  He's sitting there at the monitors looking at the tape that they taped the night before,  and his head is down, and his hands are in his face, and he's like, oh, God, he's like  having an anxiety attack, and I come in like, hey, Pete, what's up? 
[03:33:00]  Show me what you got.  He goes, sit down.  Sit down.  I'm like, why?  He goes, I'll show you.  So I guess they had one camera that was going to be the two-shot of us, okay?  So it's two-shot of us on a stage, but then you could see the audience, so it would be  a nice shot, right?  One of our asshole listeners, because they had monitors on the side, realized they could  really fuck with the cameraman, so they're looking at the monitor, and then they're pointing 
[03:33:30]  out our packages.  One guy was jerking us off from the crowd.  He looked at the monitor, got his hand right in front of one of us.  Where our dicks would be.  Where our dicks would be, and started moving his hand like he's jerking us off, and no  one saw this the entire show.  So Pete's like, I can't use any of this.  He goes, and that's the long shot, so all he could use.  Not the long shot.  No, that was the medium shot, the two shot.  So now all they could do was use the mile-away shot that they used at the opening of the show  to show the whole audience and us on stage like a millimeter tall, or the side stage 
[03:34:00]  cam, which is like ridiculous to use.  I go, well, Pete, that's no big deal.  He goes, no, it is.  He did it through the entire thing.  The whole goddamn thing.  Because they had, like I said, they had the monitors on the side, so he was able to line  up his two little fingers to make it look like he was jerking us off.  You know, he was fast-forwarding through the tape just waiting for that break, and maybe 
[03:34:30]  his arm falls asleep.  Nothing.  This guy was dedicated to the bit, man.  Just did it the entire time.  So the first show was us finally going, hey, we're here at the WWF restaurant, and we're  so tiny on the screen, because like Ann said, we had to use the far-away shot.  That was supposed to be the zoom in, and then we finally talk, you know?  Yeah.  It was horrific.  I forgot what else they were doing, but they were like, I don't know, he was drawing balls  on us and stuff with his fingers.  And they would curse like crazy.  You'd finally stumble through the line you're supposed to say, and it would just be, yeah, 
[03:35:00]  motherfucker, from the crowd, oh, got to do it again.  And then they tell us, they go, could you go out and make an announcement to your audience  not to curse?  I go, no, you don't understand.  You don't do that.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  No, go out there and tell them not to curse.  Look, we'll just run through it enough times, we'll get one where they're not cursing, because  we can't.  They're in over there.  All right.  Go out there.  Guys, the production here, we really need you guys not to curse during the, ha, ha, ha, 
[03:35:30]  mother fuck, fuck, shit fuck, bitch, cunt fuck.  Nothing but cursing.  They're pests, is what they are.  We've raised them to be pests.  We finally acknowledged that they're just pests.  There's nothing we can do about it.  That was a nightmare.  The show was canceled after, how many shows did we actually do?  We did four or six.  We did four or something.  I don't even know anymore.  We were scheduled to do the whole season, but then they called us and said, all right.  We got paid for them all, though.  That was cool.  I'm sure that was rough to hear that that was canceled.  Yeah.  You know that nightmare you're doing every week?  I know.  That's what it was, too.  You don't have to do that anymore. 
[03:36:00]  Thank God.  Yeah, the anxiety we felt.  I was thanking God.  We only have a few minutes left in the show.

Yeah, I'm a postor.  No, you only have one post?  Yeah.  What was his post about?  Yeah, if you...  Hi.  You go to Wackbag...  I think that's actually what it was.  New to the board.  Anybody check out that sign? 
[03:40:00]  We all go to Wackbag every day, but he decided he needed a post one day, and...  What's his post say?  It's under Washington, D.C. Wackbagger, so you're from the D.C. area.  Yeah.  And it just says nothing.  You post it, just acknowledge that you're Washington, D.C. Wackbagger.  Wait, it's got to be.  What if you click on that link?  Oh, you just say, uh, your hometown, Maryland, reporting, right?  Right.  Okay.  Oh. 
[03:40:30]  Just a little location check.  You are an exciting guy.  Fancy man.  What do you do for fun?  He's got one post.  He's got one post.  He basically said what town he lives in.  All right.  What do you do for fun?  It's a good way to kick off the discussion.  It's a start, right.  Yeah?  Nothing?  Not really.  No?  Holy crap.  Wow.  You're a perfect guest for this show.  You are devoid of personality.  You really are.  Why, thank you.  All right, Eric. 
[03:41:00]  Could you, uh...  Any, uh...  Could you, uh, yeah.  There he goes.  He's sitting out there waiting for his sign.  Well, thank you very much.  All right.  There he goes, Eric.  There he goes, Eric.  Hey, there he goes, Eric.  And Radar.  He came back in for a second.  He did.  He forgot his pen.  Yeah, was that funny?  All right.  Wow.  Friggin' music.  Know what we forgot to talk about today?  What?  Uh, did you know we're going back to the moon?  Oh, that's right. 
[03:41:30]  I did read a little bit about this.  We are going back to the moon in...  What year are we up to?  We're going to go back in 13 years from right now.  2018.  They're talking about going back to the moon.  Going back to the moon.  Going to cost, uh...  About billions upon billions of dollars.  But...  And what's the reason?  Because it's cool.  The moon is cool and going there is cool.  Is it because we want to go to Mars eventually?  Yeah.  That would be like the, uh... 
[03:42:00]  You know, the whole reason we really started the, um...  The, uh...  Space program.  A lot of the stuff we started in the early 60s was to get to the moon.  So, you're doing one thing, but it's helping out learning how to go that further step.  So, going to the moon now is, uh...  Not just revisiting the moon like we did and doing what we did there.  It's a way to get to the, uh...  Danny's holding up signs that we're going because we forgot our flag.  That's still blowing in the wind up there. 
[03:42:30]  It stinks.  I can't believe I used it.  I'm devoid of a line today.  Yeah.  That flag's still blowing in the wind.  Blowing in the breeze.  Now, so, now we're going to go to the moon so we can try out new, uh, cool equipment and stuff.  And maybe make some kind of a base there.  But if we already went to the moon...  ...in a place without an atmosphere.  Yeah.  That's a great place to start a base.  Yeah, you build things.  But if we already went to the moon, why do we have to wait 13 more years to go back?  Yeah, that's a little odd.  Couldn't we go there tomorrow? 
[03:43:00]  You would think we would have the stuff.  We've done it already.  So, just whip up some more of the stuff we had and go.  Right.  I mean, it seemed pretty easy.  Uh, Kennedy mentioned going to the moon in the early 60s.  And by the late 60s, we were there.  So, why is this one...  You can't land the space shuttle on there.  No.  It'd be rough.  It would be a very difficult thing to do.  But why can't we just make another lunar module, make another Apollo rocket, blast it off, and go?  It was a glitch. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I think it was...  The hatch just blew.  You screwed the pooch.  All right.  Yeah, I just think it's going to take a little longer than it really should.  Exactly.  Let's say hi to Pat.  Pat, what did you learn on the show today?  Mescaline is like mittens.  Like mittens.  Very nice.  Prozac, whack bag.  I learned sensible shoes can kill an erection.  And Stanton Island is just a guinea gangplank to New Jersey.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric in Boston.  Hey. 
[03:44:00]  How about those Pats, Eric?  Yeah, Pats looked good yesterday.  I learned that you guys really are...  No, they didn't.  Go ahead.  You guys really are radio geniuses.  You told us the plan.  How you had nothing for the show and still made me laugh for four hours.  Ah, that's the way it works.  We did have fun today.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  And, of course, we'll end with this.  Scott in Florida.  Go ahead, Scott.  If they went to the moon in the 60s, my cell phone would be able to work from Miami to Hollywood 
[03:44:30]  for more than 14 seconds.  We didn't go to the moon.  Thank you.  This concludes our podcast.  We will be an Anthony show. </pre>
