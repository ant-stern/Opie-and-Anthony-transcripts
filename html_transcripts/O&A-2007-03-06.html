<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a darkly humorous juxtaposition of a listener's impending violent act and typical morning show pleasantries.  The hosts then dive into a news story about a discovered human head, quickly shifting to a disturbing video of teenagers giving toddlers marijuana.  Extensive discussion ensues, fueled by caller reactions and speculation about the teenagers' motives, with one caller attempting to interpret their slang and another jokingly suggesting a Rastafarian connection.  The conversation touches on racism, boredom, and the absurdity of the situation, with the recurring, unexplained term "frunkus" peppered throughout.  Callers, many seemingly intoxicated, contribute to the chaotic mix, with one sharing a childhood story about harming a salamander, sparking a discussion on violence. Another recounts a bizarre encounter with a deer and a sawzall.  The hosts then boast about increased ratings in New York City and Chicago, criticize Hillary Clinton's perceived inauthenticity using a sound clip, and savagely mock a competing radio show, Eric and Kathy, playing clips to highlight their perceived blandness and lack of originality.

This criticism of Eric and Kathy continues, with Opie and Anthony playing more audio clips and mocking their billboard, suggesting alternative, more dramatic couple pairings.  Their commentary is filled with profanity and crude humor, drawing comparisons to dysfunctional celebrity couples.  Listener calls offer further comedic relief, including one about toilet water sloshing in windy weather and another, Greg's, sexually explicit account of an encounter on a flight to Seattle, sparking further discussion about airplane sex.  The hosts again mention their Chicago ratings, contrasting them with Eric and Kathy's success. A "story of the month" competition features a middle school principal's drug arrest and a man defecating on a sleeping woman on a plane. The segment ends with more Eric and Kathy mockery and promotion of a MacBook Karaoke contest.

The show continues with more discussion of the MacBook karaoke contest, mocking the phrase "whatever about your fries, dude."  This transitions into a graphic description of a husband dismembering his wife, juxtaposing wedding photos with the gruesome reality.  The hosts then discuss FCC complaints about the Super Bowl, specifically Prince's performance and a Snickers commercial. A caller, Lori, a self-proclaimed "prize pig," defends Eric from the hosts' attacks while criticizing Kathy, boasting about past contest wins, including breakfast with Jon Bon Jovi and seeing Johnny Rzeznik in his underwear. The conversation delves into a discussion about offensive language, focusing on the words "faggot" and "nigger," exploring their usage, impact, and Ann Coulter's use of the former.  The hosts debate the offensiveness of various words and phrases, referencing Louis C.K., and touch on the removal of Native American mascots from sports teams. A humorous suggestion for a new WNBA team name, "Team Lippy," is offered.  The segment ends with more banter about offensive language and a humorous anecdote about a chewed pen.

A segment focusing on Native American sports mascots and the related controversies follows, filled with highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes. A caller, Rooster, accuses Jimmy Norton of hypocrisy.  The discussion broadens to encompass the portrayal of various ethnic groups in media, referencing Marlon Brando.  Listener calls provide more examples of mascots and offensive language, along with anecdotes of negative fan behavior, including violence towards mascots and a satchel charge incident in Philadelphia.  Other unrelated stories, including a woman attempting arson, sixth graders having sex, a man having sex in a hospital, and worms in a fish, are also discussed.  Keith Robinson, a comedian, is present in the studio. Opie's need for milk becomes a recurring theme.

The final segment consists of listener calls and vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and unnamed studio individuals.  Calls recount a blowjob from a male nurse, a humorous encounter with a short movie theater employee, and a wife's drunken wedding day insult.  The hosts share personal anecdotes, including one about a much younger girlfriend. They briefly discuss news items, including a man running over his wife after their wedding, and heavily criticize the poorly received MacBook karaoke contest advertisement.  The segment concludes with more discussion of personal lives and plans for upcoming broadcasts ("Whip Them Out Wednesday," "Booby Day"), punctuated by crude jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony show, and sex bagel gets hit with poker chips. 
[00:00:30]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Razzle-dazzle. Hi. Razzle-dazzle. Ready for some razzle-jazzle? Razzle-dazzle.  Razzle-dazzle. Ah, good morning. Oh, oh. Good morning. Right. Although the music kind 
[00:01:00]  of doesn't quite fit with the, hey, wake up. The gentle nudge awake. Hey. Wake up. We have  discovered that a lot of people set their alarm clocks for 6 a.m. to this fine, fine channel.  And it goes off, and this is the first thing they hear, so we want to wake them up a little  more gently. Yes. You don't want to be shocked awake. This is the Opie and Anthony show. Who 
[00:01:30]  are we waking up today? Oh. I got one. Bye. There's a guy out there somewhere. Huge fan of  the Opie and Anthony show. Good. But he's also a horrific person. In what way? Um, he's  going to sever the head of an individual today. Wow. Good morning to you. And good morning 
[00:02:00]  to the head that doesn't know it's going to come off. Oh. No, no. They listen to a morning  zoo, so screw them. If they were listening to us, they'd be warned. Yeah, we just warned  them. We can't warn this person because they were dumb enough to listen to another radio  station. But there's a guy out there right now. He's starting his day with a little,  a few stretches, a couple lip smacks. Does anyone really do that? He's going to shuffle 
[00:02:30]  into the kitchen and get some coffee brewing. He's going to go outside and get his morning  newspaper. He's going to maybe have a little cereal. Yeah. And he's going to break out the  old bowling ball bag from, uh, the basement. He's going to leave the bowling ball behind.  He's been thinking about this. Oh yeah, he has. Today's the day. Today is the day. That  he just needs to sever someone's head. Is it someone he knows or just a random person? 
[00:03:00]  Someone that, uh, did him wrong. Did him wrong. Yeah. He's, uh, he's getting ready to do what  he just needs to do. Hack through it and put it in a bowling ball bag and off he goes.  Well, we're stupid. We're stupid to think that we're just waking up nice people. Yeah.  We're waking up horrific people as well. It's just how the world works. Yeah. A lot of radio  shows give the old, Hey, good morning. Good morning. Like everyone's a nice person listening.  Right. Right. We have nice listeners. Our listeners are great. Well, I'm looking in front 
[00:03:30]  of me just really quickly, a human head found on side of highway. See, so that, that guy,  whoever did that probably listened to the radio. That guy likes to listen to something. Yeah.  While he's driving away in his car. He's got, he's got a head in the car. He's ready to toss  it out and something's playing on his radio. Yes. It could be us. It could be, who knows?  Who knows? Could be like, wake up with whoopee. No. Boom. And the head goes out the window.  No, that would be the weed kids. Oh, the weed kids. Yeah. No, the weed kids were probably 
[00:04:00]  listening to like a hot 97. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You know, there's a follow-up to that  story this morning as well. Well, is there? Yeah. I don't know if there is a follow-up.  I heard it. What do you mean? I didn't understand a word they were saying. Oh, really?  Holy Jesus. Was this the white news though? Uh, yeah. I, I, the reporter, I understood. Uh-huh. But  apparently the reporter got an exclusive interview. With the teenagers? With one of 
[00:04:30]  the gentlemen who was, uh, giving one of these children a marijuana cigarette, as I like to  call it, a marijuana cigarette. And, um. Are you disturbed by that video at all? Not  at all. Why? It doesn't disturb me. Why? Because you don't know him? Because I don't know him  is like number one reason. Are you amazed this type of thing goes on? Uh, no. Not  at all. I watched it in, uh, Menace to Society. I always thought that kids were. Remember when  a little kid came out and they were like, hey, give him a drink, give him a toko, give 
[00:05:00]  him a hit off the joint. Stupid me, I always thought kids were like kind of hands off.  Like, you just, even, even horrific people for the most part leave kids alone. Except  for like, you know, the obvious, uh, you know, uh, people that kill kids and all that.  Yeah. But I'm talking about like family members would leave their own little, little  kids alone. Yeah. They, they do that a lot, apparently. Really? Yeah. God, I learn something  every day. That video just disturbs me when certain families are more, uh, responsible  with their children than other families. It's just the way it is. What bothers me about the 
[00:05:30]  video, it's obvious the kids aren't, uh, token for the first time because they just, they  just, uh, look way too comfortable and they just happened to, they just decided to finally,  you know, roll some tape for their boys, you know? Yeah. Look, yo, yo, check this out.  Check this out. Yo, yo, check this out. Cause that,  I mean that, uh, 18 month old was handling a joint better than, than I. Yeah. Not  that I smoke pot anymore, but I, I never looked that cool. It was good. His little  fingers can pull the roach without really getting them burnt. It's like a little roach 
[00:06:00]  clip. A little laugh or had technique. He was, uh, you know what he was doing? So, uh,  there is a followup to that, but basically, you know, uh, what? Two teenagers, uh, getting,  are, are they related to the, to the, the babies? Probably somehow, some way, some way.  They're all in the same house. Two teenagers are token up. You know, the story hopefully  by now. And, and all of a sudden they get these, uh, two babies that aren't no more  than 18 months old. I would say maybe two. One of them. Yeah. One of them was, uh, two 
[00:06:30]  and five. Yeah. Two. Okay. Nevermind. Yeah. It's, it just hit me two years old and five  years old. Got them high. So here's the followup. And you're telling me there's no real  followup. I, um, I was trying to understand what the gentleman was saying. Uh, I'm sorry.  Uh, it's terrible. I'm sorry. I couldn't understand. A teenager caught on camera sharing  marijuana with two toddlers is now speaking out. Demetrius McCoy admits that he was wrong  for videotaping his two and four year old nephew smoking pot. McCoy says his behavior was drug 
[00:07:00]  McCoy. He's adamant. He's stoned Jim. Hard. They're not a play with the smoke. I don't  think they're in heaven or nothing. It seemed natural to you. It seemed okay. Yeah. It ain't  natural, but yeah, it's okay. Because you've seen it done before. Yeah. And people known for  doing it. Have you given it to any other children? No. No other children. So that's, that's. I 
[00:07:30]  wasn't intended on giving it to them. It's just, I was caught off guard. I wasn't in my  right mind. What? I was trying to go on children, but I got some more right mind. Do they have  subtitles? No. So what was the guy saying there? I don't know what that last line was. That's  what I heard. And I was like, wait, what did he say? I know he said that this thing has  been done before. Last line was something like I was caught off guard and I wasn't in my  right mind. Oh, no. Here it is. Some people call it a sling blade. I call it a Kaiser blade. 
[00:08:00]  That's pretty funny. Let's say hi to John at Queens. What's up, John? You're on the Opie  and Anthony show. Hey, good morning, everybody. How's it going? Pretty good, John. Hey, listen,  you know, this might not be that unusual. I remember an anthropology textbook that I had  in college. This was, you know, maybe 10 years back. And there was a picture in it  of three little Rastafarian kids. Each one would have looked like a huge slip in their 
[00:08:30]  hand. Yeah, that's kind of the culture of Rasta.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Maybe these guys are, you know, part of that kind of culture  and were just, you know, maybe they didn't think it was that unusual.  Well, maybe they got a lawyer that'll claim that, that they're Rastafarian and this is their  religious belief and they can get kids stoned and whatever. Jesus Christ, you're getting  kids stoned. How bored do you have to be? Why aren't you working? I mean, or just maybe  be out doing something. Well, maybe it was before work, Anthony. Oh, yeah. Got to have 
[00:09:00]  an open mind. Maybe it was before work. Maybe they had the day off. Maybe it was, uh, maybe  it was a, uh, maybe it was president's day when the video was shot. Was shot a little while  ago. Maybe it was a president's day and they had the day off. Yeah. How far down? Maybe it  was the weekend. So you're very close minded. You're just assuming that these two youths  don't work or go to school. No, I'm just also how far down on the list is let's, you know, 
[00:09:30]  you're sitting around the house because believe me, I've been bored and I've been stoned with  my friends hanging out and I don't know how far down on the list. Let's get this little  kid stoned is, you know, aside from, you know, let's eat a whole Entenmann's to apple pie.  Let's watch Gilligan's Island. Uh, there's, there's 5,000 things that would come to mind  before prank phone calls possibly, prank calls, maybe a little Fox box. Yeah. You're definitely 
[00:10:00]  not playing the week cause we is, uh, we is for queers. Yeah, exactly. Fans got a wee.  See, when you want to exercise, you go to a gym, you go to a gym when you want to hang out  and play video games. You sit down and play video games. Right. It's a little weird that  you, that you actually work out as you're playing a video game. Many different platforms you  could play your games on, but you know, the wee, I don't know. What are you punching?  You're swinging a racket. Right. Hey, uh, we got Nigel from Kentucky. I speak a little black. 
[00:10:30]  He writes, I will translate. Oh, okay. Nigel. Yes. The colored gentleman was saying that he  had some youngsters in his abode and that he did not intend for it to go that far. However,  he was not in his right mind and it thus led to giving them the marijuana. Oh, it was not,  he wasn't in his right mind. Is that really what he said? I think I might be right. Yes. He truly  said I wasn't in my right mind. I didn't intend for it to happen. Something to that effect. And 
[00:11:00]  Nigel, where do you learn how to speak the, uh, uh, speak the black? Um, I really could  not tell you. I hang around with some black guys. Oh, that's a, that's a hell of a talent.  Let me, let me hear. Hold on a second. I'm going to play with the smoke. Oh yeah. All right.  Let me move back a little here. His behavior was drug induced and he's adamant the kids weren't  harmed. I'm going to play with the smoke. I don't think they're in heaven or nothing. It seemed 
[00:11:30]  natural to you. It seemed okay. It ain't natural, but yeah, it's okay. Because you've seen it done  before. Yeah. And people known for doing it. Have you given it to any other children? No,  no other children. Okay. So that's, that's. I wasn't intended on giving it to them. It's just,  I was caught up going. I wasn't in my right mind. Holy crap. I was caught up going in my right mind.  I was really focusing that time, really concentrating. Did they say something about, uh,  they do this in new Orleans all the time? Uh, he had done it before in new Orleans. I heard 
[00:12:00]  new Orleans in there. Really? I don't know where this story is from. Where is it from? I don't  know. I thought I heard New Orleans in there. No, they had done it before and you didn't think  that they had inhaled before. He thought it was fine. Uh, but they apparently had done this  repeatedly on several occasions. Yeah. You can tell that the kids were comfortable with the  spleef. Uh, but I guess that guy saying that they, they, uh, didn't inhale. They were just 
[00:12:30]  kind of playing with the smoke that I guess that's okay. Yeah, that's fine. If you're two years old  with the pot smoke, as long as you just play with it, that's fine. Yeah. That ain't going to cause  any problems whatsoever. Doesn't he understand, stand that? Like you see the way that guy speaks  and what he's doing with a child getting him stoned. Doesn't he understand that him doing  that to a small child is just leading him on the, the same road that he's on. This guy  can absolutely not get himself a good job. Absolutely. Like even if he wanted to just 
[00:13:00]  saying how, where did he grow up? Well, he sounded high while he was talking the whole time.  Yeah. Yeah. Of course he was in jail or something. What the hell is, I think they just got out  of, uh, jail and they were kind of celebrating a little bit. Kind of laughing as they left  jail too. Yeah. So what kind of friends does he have? Like that he would show the tape to  a bunch of them and they'd go, ha, it's good. Yeah. Well, well, obviously that would do  the same thing. Obviously his friends weren't that good. Friends that would show the tape 
[00:13:30]  from the Korean, uh, deli too. Yeah. Somebody actually uploaded that to YouTube. Uh, yeah.  See, now you can put everything on YouTube. Everything goes on YouTube. You don't think anyone  else is, uh, looking at your videos. You think it's just up there for you and your friends.  Yeah. All right. Thank you, Nigel. You and your friends.  Frankus. Yeah, yeah. Frankus indeed, my friend. Uh, let's, let's say hi to Ray in Philly  listening on WYSP. Ray, what's up? Hey, what's happening, guys? Hey. Hey, man. Hey, the part  where you thought you heard New Orleans, what he had said was a reporter said, did you and 
[00:14:00]  do you, you know, do you know that people do this? And he said, yeah, people are known for  it. Are known for it. So he knows people that do this all the time, apparently.  Ah, they're getting the kids stoned now is like the thing to do, I guess. Is this the  new thing to do? We don't, we don't know. This is the first, I'm hearing of it. But  then again, I'm white. Well, what do we know? We really try not to do that to our, our,  our, uh, our nephews and nieces. I buy the little kids savings bonds. Yeah. And some 
[00:14:30]  communities, uh, get them stoned. There you go. All right. Thank you, sir. All right.  Let's go to Rob in Dallas. Rob, what's up? Hey, what's going on, guys? Hey. Hey, man.  Hey, look, I don't see why this is any big deal. They do it in laboratories all across  America. What do you mean they do it in laboratories? Laboratories. You know what I  mean? Hold on a minute. You can't just say, you know what I mean? What the hell are they  doing in the labs? You know, shwuggies. Oh, Jesus. Are you saying they're using young 
[00:15:00]  black children for experiments? Are you saying they're cheaper than buying rats?  Exactly. What are you getting at there, Rob? You racist. I think he's being a racist.  Frunkist. Why the frunkist today? I don't know. Someone's frunkisting us. Are they attacking  us? But it's Jimmy's word. I understand that, but why three in a row? Are the pests  on to something today? I don't know. Something's going on. I think they're just listening on 
[00:15:30]  hold and getting caught up in the frunkist moment. Let's see how to Harry in North Carolina.  Harry. Hey, uh, you know, I think they've been doing this for a while with those kids  to look so natural. And, uh, another thing that kind of bothered me is the reporter said  that the teenager was sorry that he filmed it, not sorry that he did it. Yeah, I'm sorry  I filmed it. Well, of course. Now, and there's one other thing I want to say before I let  you guys go. Um, the reporter should have asked that teenager to repeat after her and 
[00:16:00]  say, get a job, sparkling wiggle. Yeah. I don't know if we could play that, uh, over  here. I don't think so. That is one of the greatest video clips ever. I think it's up  on opianthony.com. So you're going to have to do a little, uh, a little searching on your  own when you get to work today, but, uh, check out sparkling wiggles if you haven't seen  the video yet. I believe it's all over YouTube as well. Thank you, Harry. All right. Oh,  boy. There goes that street. That's a frunkist. Let's call. Yeah, let's go to Harry in Buffalo.  Harry, what's up? Oh, it's a mighty frunkist all the way out here on the West Coast. You're 
[00:16:30]  not on the West Coast. You're in Buffalo. I'm out here in California, even though I'm from  Buffalo. Oh, okay. So wait, wait. When you, when someone says. Hold on a minute. Dude,  dude. Hold on a minute. Dude, hold on, Harry. Is everyone stoned this morning? When someone  asks you where you're from, you tell them where you're calling from, not where you're from.  Like, what the hell is that? Calling from, where are you from? Sweden. What would you do 
[00:17:00]  if you were in France and war broke out with the U.S. and France and you just pick up a  French uniform and fight for them? Come back. All right. Where are you at in California?  Oh, headed down to Los Angeles. I'm headed down to five. I got a truckload of Mexicans. I'm  taking them back to the border. No, you shut up. Yeah, I think you're right. Stoned. All  right. So what's up, Harry? Well, I woke up this morning and I severed the head you guys  wanted. So I'm going to bolt down the freeway here in a minute. Wouldn't it be odd? Wouldn't 
[00:17:30]  it be? Why are we trying hard with this? Wouldn't it just be amazing if this guy actually had  a severed head in his hand driving his truck down the road? Well, maybe people should call  from their horrific jobs today. I know someone out there is just calling from just a ridiculous  situation. All right. What do you got? Is that all you have, Harry? No, no, no. Yesterday  morning I was watching TV from my hotel room and they interviewed the grandmother. And  she says, I quote, they do this all the time and they need discipline. They need discipline. 
[00:18:00]  They need discipline. They need discipline. That's what the grandmother is for. Discipline.  Yeah. When the mother has to leave her kids with her mother, obviously the grandmother's done  such a good job raising the mother that she could now do a great job raising the mother's  kids. Sure. Exactly. All right, Harry. All right. Frunkus. I don't know what's going on  today. Something weird is going on today with this frunkus. And I just know we have to dumb 
[00:18:30]  down the show. We don't need to really try. Yeah, just dumb it down. Click it down a few  notches. I think what we need to do is just say boobies all day and laugh uncontrollably.  Yeah. I think that'll get the job done. Just dial it down to stupid. Where's the dial?  We started with this theory, so we'll end this break with a fine little news story.  The mystery deepens around the dismembered body of a man that was found yesterday. Today, 
[00:19:00]  body parts are discovered. This morning, a Caltrans worker found a human hand near State Route  163 at Interstate 5. And a tow truck driver found a bag with a severed human head inside.  The body parts were evidently those of a man whose torso was found yesterday morning in  the Otay River. Oh, my God. And a head truck driver found a tow. Yeah, there you go.  You think that hand they found on the side of the road, it was just thumbs up trying to  get away from the rest of the body? Tow truck driver not doing his job, picking up the wrong 
[00:19:30]  body parts, you silly goose. Everyone knows the joke.  After a gruesome find yesterday, the mystery further intensified early this morning. When  a tow truck driver discovered a severed head in a trash bag, there apparently were no other  clues at the scene. Ninety minutes later, another grim discovery involving human remains,  a severed hand. The first discovery of remains occurred early yesterday morning. Two plumbers 
[00:20:00]  who stopped on Hollister Street in Palm City discovered a torso in an Otay River culvert.  Wow. A torso. Man, someone was pissed. Hacking them apart. Later in the day, police released  the photo captured by the surveillance camera. The white male appears to be in his 60s. He's  balding with a mustache and glasses. You know it as well as we do. It's the $64 question.  What led police to that photo? And why do they think the head and the body parts are of the 
[00:20:30]  person in that image?  Wow. So there you go. There's your human head story today.  Someone was angry, man. What are you thinking when you're just sawing through somebody's head  and stuff? Like, you're just thinking, yeah, I just kind of saw through this. Are you thinking  about the act? Are you so gone that you're just thinking about something like frigging unicorns  or something? Or do you try to go to a happy place? Like, is it freaking you out? Do you 
[00:21:00]  whistle a happy tune? Yeah. Or is it freaking you out that you're cutting somebody's limbs  off? Well, you got to build yourself up to the point where you're going to do this. So  you're like, I know I can do this. I know I can do this. I know I can do this. And then  in the middle of it, you're right. I think something happens because we're all humans and you're  like, Oh my God. What am I doing? I got to finish though. I got to finish or I'm screwed.  So hacks on through when you feel the first, cause it's gotta be like the flesh is one 
[00:21:30]  thing. But then when you feel the first contact with bone and go, all right, now I got, now  I got to lean into it. Elbow grease. Now I really got to lean into it. Oh God. And are  you, are you like, do you answer a few questions to yourself? Like, Oh, I didn't think it was  going to be this easy or something like, you know, it's one of those mysteries. Like  I don't know what it's like to cut through someone's arm. The first inch is pretty easy.  Yeah. This is, it's just meat. And then you get to all the bone. Okay. Well, then you  get to the neck, you know, the neck bone there, the spine and the neck itself. It's just 
[00:22:00]  probably, there's a lot of like slop and cause there's a lot of stuff going on in  the neck. So it's probably just like caking on the blade. Do you like realize at that  point you need some tunes? Yeah. Maybe some tunes will help. You're like, Oh God, I got  to go get my Leonard Skinner tape. I got it. I got to distract myself here. Let me just  pop in some tunes. I'll just sing. Are you playing a little air guitar in between, in  in between sawing? Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Oh man, Alabama, where the skies are so blue.  When I, when I read or, or see these horrific stories, I always like think back, oh man,  we all started the same more or less here. You're in little league together. We're playing  a little soccer. Every killer's got that picture of them as a kid, just all, you know, smiles.  In this little baseball uniform. Yeah. For the most part. I mean, opening up Christmas  presents on Christmas morning. There's always the, the, the, the few that are just born 
[00:23:00]  disturbed and just, yeah, we'll do horrific things from almost day one. But in general,  everyone kind of is doing the same thing in their informative years. And then something  just drastically changes that make them go. Do you ever do something that like when, when  you look back, you go, wow, that was a defining moment in whether I was going to be a serial  killer and not nothing like that. Cause I have this, what'd you kill? I, what animal  did you kill? No, what did you rape and then let live? No, it was, um, uh, when I was living 
[00:23:30]  out in East Islip, Long Island, um, there used to be a park and it had like a marsh in  it. And, um, there were actually turtles and, and salamanders and all kinds of little amphibious  creatures and reptiles walking around in this, uh, uh, little pond. It was kind of cool.  And all those kids would go in the neighborhood would go down there and catch them and kind  of keep them as little pets or whatever. So I got a salamander once and I'm out by the  back picnic table of my house and I put the salamander on the picnic table and I'm just 
[00:24:00]  kind of looking at him and he's doing a salamander thing, just kind of, you know, walking around  and I'm kind of touching them and stuff. And, and then I took a piece of, um, you ever  open it? Well, obviously everybody has, you take a can opener and open a can and the top  part of the can is round and very sharp edges, razor sharp. And I took it and I rolled it  right across the salamander's back to cut him in half while he was alive. Yeah. He was 
[00:24:30]  completely alive and he went, he went, it made this salamander screaming noise and it horrified  me. I think I was probably seven. I had just turned seven years old and it, I, and I was  just, I don't know why I did it or anything I did. I don't think I knew the like the consequences  yet or anything. So I kind of did that and it freaked me out. The thing screamed, I ran away  and, and that was it. I knew like, like I would never do that again. I knew it was 
[00:25:00]  wrong. I knew like there was no thrill in it. That's for sure. It was nothing but that  dark gloomy death feeling that I felt really bad for doing it. The worst we did, we used  to take magnify, uh, you know, magnified, magnifying glasses, uh, to like, uh, ants.  Bugs are different. Yeah. Bugs you kill all the time. You kill them in your house. You  still do. Yeah. Bugs are like bugs aren't bugs or aliens. They, they, then they have 
[00:25:30]  nothing to do with this, uh, this earth. So bugs are fine. So go out there and kill  as many bugs as you want. They mean nothing. Although my girlfriend is crazy about like  killing anything. Right. So if there's a bug in the house, I have to catch and release  no matter what it is. I have to catch it with a cup and then slide like paper under  the cup, take it outside and put it outside. But how about if it was a roach? I kill  roaches. No roaches. I used to catch and release. I'm like, why am I catching and  releasing roaches? No, not a roach. Roaches die. Roaches die. And when I have my moth 
[00:26:00]  problem, now it's an old sneaker right to the back of its head. And when I have my  moth problem, I had to explain to the girlfriend, look, this is a huge problem that we were being  overrun. I have to kill every single moth. Kill them. In this place you had them in the  new. No, no, no. That was the place I was in before this. By the way, with the salamander,  there's other people that do that. And there's a little salamander screaming and the little  person gets off and they're like, wow, I like this feeling. And that's where it begins. 
[00:26:30]  But it's so vivid in my head. Like I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember doing that  and feeling so awful about doing it that I couldn't do anything like that again. I've  hunted after that, which I think is different than just grabbing something and killing it  in such a sick way. You know, this is, it's too early for this, man.  And it's wake up time, people.  I was just talking about a, hey, who did you do, Capuch?  I don't know about anyone else, but I just want to talk about a warm bosom. 
[00:27:00]  It's early. We just, we should be talking about warm bosoms.  Death and destruction.  Let's say hi to Jake in Florida. Jake, end this discussion. Will you, Jake?  Hey, man.  Oh, yeah. I got a bad one. I'll try to give it a short and sweet version. I was driving  behind this woman and I saw her hit a deer. So pull over. After she gets out, the thing's  head is on backwards. It's sticking out from under the car. I tell her to call the police  because her car's all messed up. I try yanking out the deer and it's not coming. So to skip 
[00:27:30]  all everything else, I have to grab the battery sawzall out of the truck.  Oh, yeah. Climb underneath and I'm working away for a few minutes, finally get the hoof  off and climb back out. And there's a Stady standing there and I'm standing there with  the gory sawzall.  That looks like a serial killer.  Oh, yeah. Good times.  Good times.  Good times. 
[00:28:00]  Good times.  All right, Jake.  All right. That's all I got.  Frankus.  What's up with the Frankus?  I don't know. I think the people are just getting caught up in it.  No, I think something's going on. We'll get to the bottom of this. Listen, we got to  take a break. We're really late.  All right.  We got, you know how we're kind of doing story of the month now?  Yeah.  We might have a new leader.  Oh.  I have a little confidence in this story that we were talking about in the office,  by the way. So we might have a new leader in story of the month. Where's this coming?  What's that? Whatever. We'll figure it all out after the break. It's the Opie and Anthony 
[00:28:30]  show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. O and A uncut and live continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  There's way too much gay on the Opie and Anthony show. So much gay that every time we manage  to clear the gay out, it prances back in. We'll oil each other up. A couple of men oil 
[00:29:00]  each other up after we shave each other's bodies.  So we're developing Booby Day. Every week, in an effort to get the gay out of the show,  women are encouraged to join the program for Booby Day in the hopes that we can reestablish  our heterosexuality. Ladies, you can probably guess what we're going to ask you to do on a  day like Booby Day. And if you can't, then you're stupid and you should stay home.  Details on OpieandAnthony.com. 
[00:29:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Dick Cheney has a health scare, I guess. Eh, whatever.  That blood clot is like.  Like a deep blood clot?  When they got to operate? Or do they operate? What's the deal?  I don't know. Of course, they, you know, yesterday on the news, I saw it and it was like,  oh, it's not serious. They say that about everything. Didn't they say that like when  Kennedy was shot? At first, it was like, ah, nothing. 
[00:30:00]  Bird flew in his hat.  That's going on today. Oh, by the way, a big high to New York City.  We got a ratings trend yesterday.  We had a nice little bump up. A little bump up.  A little bump up.  We got some work still to do.  But we're headed in the right direction.  We had a nice little bump up yesterday.  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Even more interesting, hello Chicago. 
[00:30:30]  Hello to everyone listening to us on WCKG.  We had a nice bump up in Chicago.  Yeah.  We have lots of work to do in Chicago as well, but this bump up was very, very interesting.  I think we're now in 30th place.  We're going in for 29, my friend.  Oh, it's going to be a long.  29th place.  It's going to be a long haul as far as Chicago goes.  I understand that.  They love their own.  Chicago's one of these cities, they just don't want to acknowledge that a radio show could 
[00:31:00]  be good from somewhere else.  Yeah.  Other cities, they could acknowledge that because we kind of build the opening.  Anthony community, so it doesn't really matter in the end.  But Chicago, man, they're tough.  They're real tough.  But they gave us a little bump up yesterday.  Nothing to brag about, but it shows we're moving in the right direction.  Shows some sign that people are starting to listen.  And Drew and the gang up there are kind of excited.  Yeah.  They love Jimmy Norton, and they love that you're doing Dice again there, Ant.  Well, I'm glad he's back. 
[00:31:30]  So there you go.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What's up with Hillary?  She's a phony douche.  That should be Obama's campaign rallying cry.  She is such a phony.  You might remember here in New York when she was running for Senate.  It was during, I guess, the Subway Series? 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  Well, yeah, probably.  I guess it goes back that far.  Yeah, she would wear a Yankee hat, and then she'd wear a Met hat.  And it was just, depending on what stadium she was in, and people asked her, you know,  you're living in New York now.  You're going to be the center.  You want to be the center from New York.  What team are you rooting for here?  She couldn't even commit.  Yeah.  Because, God forbid, there's anybody that she alienates. 
[00:32:30]  She'd rather just please everybody by doing nothing or doing this crap that doesn't benefit  really anybody.  It's just, she's always working on something that is going to make everyone happy, and  nothing ever gets done.  Well, most politicians do that, but she takes it to a whole new level.  It's so obvious with her.  Because, like, even, you know, Giuliani, he'll tell you, I'm a Yankee fan.  Yeah.  Oh, and that pissed off the Mets fans in the New York City area. 
[00:33:00]  But, you know, but Hillary can't even pick a baseball team.  And then she's like, ah, but I also spent some time in Chicago, so I kind of like the  Cubs as well.  I'm so sick of that.  I think people would have more respect for you if you kind of spoke your mind and told  us what issues you're really for and against.  She's against the great issues like video games, you know, things like that.  Important issues that really affect the state.  And her speaking technique, we've goofed on it before. 
[00:33:30]  It is just the phoniest politician-type speech.  There's no sincerity in what she's saying because of the way she's saying it.  You can't get any emotion out of her.  She's like a robot.  And we plan on cleaning up these violent video games so our children will be safe.  Act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act.  Yeah, she just builds.  Martian.  It's Martian-speak.  Attack of the Martians or whatever.  But you discovered this. 
[00:34:00]  Mars Attacks.  Mars Attacks.  I'm sorry, yeah.  I couldn't even remember for a second.  I know.  I thought he was right, too.  Huh?  I'm like, yeah, that was a good movie.  Act, act, act, act, act, act.  I guess Hollywood is backing Obama.  They're coming out of the woodwork to back Obama.  Yeah.  Yeah, Hillary thought she'd be the frontrunner and, you know, she'd have her.  Doors?  She had her.  Actually have to come out of woodwork.  That's like odd.  Look, here's George Clooney.  Ow, he's hurting himself coming out of that molding.  That is the dumbest expression.  Most of the expressions are stupid. 
[00:34:30]  I know.  At least Obama's a governor, though, right?  I mean, at least he's got some.  To me, she's not like a real official.  She's just a broad who married a smart guy.  Yes.  And she's kind of smart, too.  She had eight years of publicity.  Yeah.  And her ideas, like Bill was always, and I think it was her that was pushing Bill because  she knew what was going on.  So she wanted to be involved in his presidency.  Remember early on, there was all kinds of controversy because he was appointing her to  some kind of health commissions. 
[00:35:00]  And it's like, it's your wife.  She's supposed to sit there and make sure the plates are nice and clean when dignitaries  come over.  Pick out the silverware.  That's what you're supposed to do as a first lady.  Give a tour.  Pick up brains off of the trunk.  She's a very educated woman there, Anthony.  Thank you, Jimmy.  She's a very educated woman.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Well, she got all this publicity and that kind of got her where people knew who she was,  knew what she was about and elected her because at the time, too, there was really nobody to 
[00:35:30]  run against her.  Yeah.  So she gets in.  And now a presidential run.  She's she doesn't have it in her.  She's so phony that there is a clip now of her.  I think we'll do the first one is her just speaking at a regular speech.  Well, today we know that we have to move away from our dependence on foreign oil.  Everybody says that our problem has been actually trying to figure out how we would do it because 
[00:36:00]  we don't want to undermine our standard of living.  We don't want to have the lights go out.  But we've got to get serious about how to do it.  She's very well spoken there.  She obviously is talking in front of a small group of people.  It's a small group.  It's not one of those podium big speeches.  So she, yeah, kind of tames it down.  She talks.  She speaks.  You could hear her.  She's got a nice low volume speaking voice.  Very articulate. 
[00:36:30]  Now she's speaking at a Baptist church in Selma, Alabama, because she knows now that Obama is  going to get the black vote.  Sorry, Hillary.  You ain't winning this one.  She was supposed to get the black vote, though.  Yeah, she would have gotten the black vote.  You're supposed to be the Democratic candidate, obviously.  Because Bill Clinton was our first black president.  Black president.  That's horrific when they say that.  Was he getting kids stoned in the Oval Office?  We already had a black president.  His name was Bill Clinton.  Oh, boy, what a card. 
[00:37:00]  So she's speaking at this church in Selma, Alabama.  Yeah.  And Obama was down there also, and he's on a little speaking tour.  So listen how her voice changes.  She puts on this southern twang.  No, she doesn't.  Yes, she did.  And this wasn't a bit.  This was not some kind of like, let me show you that I could put on a voice and I'm goofing  around.  She did the entire speech like this.  She got caught up in this whole thing. 
[00:37:30]  She's speaking to southern black people in a Baptist church.  And she felt she had to change her voice.  She's doing impressions.  I'm embarrassed.  It was the real person.  I'm embarrassed before we listen to it.  Oh, you will be.  Oh, wow.  Let's hold on.  Anthony found a gem.  Hold on to something.  Here it is.  Hillary speaking with fake accent.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I come too far.  All right.  Wait, is she doing that as a goof, though? 
[00:38:00]  Dude, the whole speech.  No, she's got to be doing an impression of somebody like, like she's probably, here's  what she's doing.  She's reading a very famous quote from somebody who was known to be a southerner.  So she's reading it in that, in that kind of like addiction, just, you know, it's almost  like going four score.  No.  All right.  Well, let's listen to the whole clip.  And then make our decision.  She's just doing this.  Yeah, but they're laughing at her like, you know, she was going for the laugh.  They're applauding.  That's because Mitch Green is behind her and there's a pipe over the head.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far from where I started from. 
[00:38:30]  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.  And the chair of all the mayors in the country, Mayor Palmer from Trenton, New Jersey.  Oh, my God.  All right.  From Trenton, New Jersey.  She's introducing somebody.  She's like, and from Trenton, New Jersey.  So even if the first one was just her quoting something, she continued the entire speech 
[00:39:00]  where she's just like, yeah, I'm just an old Southern gal.  She's doing that white thing that white people do around black people.  And they feel like they have to change their inflection.  Guilty.  To accumulate.  Yeah.  Really?  Guilty.  I raised my hand.  I'm guilty.  Yes.  I'm guilty of that.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know.  Something happens inside me.  And the listeners pick up on it from time and time.  All of a sudden, I throw in a word or two.  So I'm like, what are you doing?  You know what I'm saying?  Not only do I not do that, but I'm still conscious of it.  I actually become more and more white and clipped. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  Excellent point, gentlemen.  I wind up going into a black comics imitation of a white guy.  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm just walking here with a...  I've got a good job and a family and an SUV.  Oh, she a phony bitch.  How can anyone vote for her?  What a phony.  Let's say hi to Tom in Connecticut.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, maybe if Hillary would like to take the votes from Obama, she ought to get some kids  stoned. 
[00:40:00]  Frunkus.  There's that frunkus again.  I don't know what's going on.  It's frightening.  There's a frunkus.  I don't understand.  Craig in Boston.  What's up, Craig?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, you guys are going to be voting for Obama up there, right?  Absolutely not.  I could see some districts, maybe.  Yeah, one or two.  One or two.  I don't think Southie's going to be pulling many handles for Obama.  Can't really see the North End pulling any handles for Obama. 
[00:40:30]  Nah.  And the only area the votes would come from, they're not even allowed to vote yet in that  district.  Oh, gee.  Boston's way behind the rest of the country.  Yeah.  Further behind than Alabama in some regards.  Some regards.  Look at you talking all Southern.  All right.  What's up, Craig?  Nah, I was just calling to say what's up.  Hey.  Oh.  Hey.  How's Mantown doing up there?  What gay bid are they doing today?  Yeah.  I have no idea. 
[00:41:00]  I listen to you guys in the morning.  Good answer.  All right.  Nah, just another quick thing.  I listen to BCM like almost all the time now that Nick Cotter's gone.  All right.  But, uh, you know, I was a big fan of you guys and you got kicked off for fucking that.  Oh, sorry.  Ooh.  You used them.  I kicked off for that May of Menino.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But, um, you know, and then all of a sudden you guys were gone for like a minute.  I couldn't find you.  And then I turned on BCN.  I'm listening to you guys now almost every morning.  Yeah.  Too bad others are not listening to us right now because they decided to move on to something 
[00:41:30]  else for a few minutes.  Thank you for the history, though.  It was like a this is your life for a little while.  I felt like I was on a game show.  Hey, look behind you.  Here comes Dave Douglas.  Hey, Dave.  How are you?  Our old program director.  How have you been?  Punch him in the face.  With that creepy gay porn mustache.  70s gay porn mustache, Dave.  Hey, man, it's 2007.  What are you doing?  Hey, but I just wanted to ask, uh, is no one ever going to perform at the Comedy Connection? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I already have Dave's book there, sir.  I believe it's next month sometime.  Good stuff.  Thank you, buddy.  Wow.  Anything else you want to do, uh, or say to slow down the program?  Um, sorry, I think your program's great.  And then, uh, oh, yeah, Toucher and Rich?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know, but they were talking about you guys the other day with your, uh, are you  doing the, I don't know, the E-entertainment with, um, Ryan Seacrest there?  Yeah.  When he kept saying, uh, oh, what the hell he was saying, but.  Well, we like to, uh, we like to. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, wow, and I'm trying to work, work this phone call.  What am I saying?  Let's just cut our losses.  Uh, basically, we like to really pay attention to what Ryan Seacrest says about, uh, girls  in general.  Because he's trying to really push that heterosexuality.  Because there's been rumors out there, so I think he's trying extra hard to make it sound  like he's really into what he likes to call hotties.  Hotties.  He's such a hottie.  Yeah, he just doesn't even know.  He's such a hottie.  Doesn't even know the vernacular.  So what was Toucher and Rich, uh, doing?  Nah, they, they were doing, like, some of the same bits, and a caller called up and was 
[00:43:00]  like, hey, why don't you guys, uh, kind of be, like, original?  And they were like, oh.  And then they were like, yeah, because O and A did it, did it in the morning time, and  now hey, you guys are at nighttime still talking about the same thing.  Sir.  All right.  Sir, I would, I would defend us, like, to the end, as far as a bit goes.  But I think the Ryan Seacrest, uh, yay rumors have, uh, been around for a while.  Well, but thank you, thank you.  I know, absolutely.  I, I, I also believe that, but then they started talking, like, uh, uh.  It's still on the phone.  It's not happening.  I know, I'm stunned. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, Craig, look at the time.  We gotta go.  They're telling us we gotta break.  We really gotta break.  They're telling us you gotta get out of here.  All right, thank you, Craig.  All I know is.  Break his phone.  All I know is BCN supports the show big time.  I hear Touch and Rich support us big time.  I hear they're doing very well on their own.  That's all I know about, uh, what's going on up there.  Everyone's allowed to talk about, like, current events.  I mean, that's not, no one knows that.  No one's current events.  Yeah, you're talking about something.  I heard them talking about American Idol.  Dude, they mentioned 9-11.  I think they got that.  No one's suspicious.  Howard did the whole Tyra, Sports Illustrated, Black History Month bit yesterday. 
[00:44:00]  Well, yeah.  You know.  See, though, that's a little crossing over.  That's a little weird, but, and this is the interesting thing.  Like, if we touch on the same subject matter as Howard, after he does, we're ripping him off.  But when he does it, what is that called?  Mm-hmm.  Is it a coincidence?  It's a coincidence?  Mm.  Mm.  We'll tell you.  Ponder that thought.  We'll tell you after this.  God, Craig stinks.  He just wrecked our flow.  Now we've got to regroup.  Craig sucks.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:44:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Virus.  Hey, Jimmy, we're back broadcasting.  What are you doing in there?  What were you doing, Jimmy?  I was tiddling.  Were you?  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  We've got a bathroom, like, I don't know, 10 feet away from where we broadcast.  Yes.  That's supposed to be a little, a private little thing. 
[00:45:00]  You should be able to, you should have to walk down the hall to take care of all that  in the morning.  Yeah.  But, uh, I don't know, as soon as the commercials hit, we all run to the bathroom over there.  Yeah, I didn't get time to, um, to go.  I realized too late.  Jimmy went in there, and now I've got to go, so I've got to just dangle my legs and kind  of do the wee-wee dance.  And my new thing is I like to brag about what's going on with me.  I just need to tell people.  I'm very, very happy. 
[00:45:30]  You know, while I'm eating a banana, I'm getting a length report.  You were kind of into it, Jimmy.  You were like, because you want the same thing happening with you.  Yeah, by my chest.  I got a whole new technique and everything, because I play a little game with myself at  home.  A game.  How long can you make it?  Starring Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  It sucks, though, because I can't brag to anybody.  No.  So I was telling you guys, I've got to tell somebody. 
[00:46:00]  You could snap a photo.  That's what Danny did with his W-shaped one.  Yeah, I should have, because yesterday was one for the ages.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Enough of that.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Remember last week we were making fun of Glenn and Rebecca?  Yes.  They're awful show.  Well, we're done with Glenn and Rebecca.  We're moving on to another awful show today.  I like these.  They're all over the country.  They're just horrid, drivel, milquetoast shows that have the guy with the radio voice and 
[00:46:30]  the hole that sits next to him and just chimes in.  And it sounds like a bad SNL sketch.  It sounds like a parody of a radio show.  They talk about nice, pleasant things and, oh, gosh, there's a lot of, oh, gosh, and things  like that.  And it's the safe kind of radio that is completely predictable, that the government wants. 
[00:47:00]  It's just that straight down the middle, don't upset anybody, kind of crap, boring drivel.  The radio companies want this type of radio.  It's safe, and it's not going to get anyone in trouble.  And I swear, we're going to play some audio here, and you're going to go, this is more  Glenn and Rebecca.  You guys played this type of thing last week.  No, it's another show.  Totally different.  Totally different.  But the same.  Every city is like, ooh.  What city? 
[00:47:30]  What city?  Is this my city?  This week.  Do I know that?  Because I know a show just like that.  That's right.  It's got to be my city.  No, they're all over.  And today, it's Eric and Kathy.  Yep.  Chicago's own Eric and Kathy.  That's why, in a way, I hate our listeners in Chicago.  Oh.  Because they allow shows like this to beat us.  Look, I know we have a lot of work ahead of us.  I know we've got to turn some people around in Chicago, especially. 
[00:48:00]  But to allow a show like this to be as big as it is, is just an embarrassment for everybody  involved.  Why is it?  I don't get it.  Why is it a show like that so big?  I don't know.  You're going to tune in every day.  You're not going to hear anything unpredictable.  I swear to you, the Opie and Anthony show, you have to listen every day.  Because tomorrow could be the day we do the stupidest thing ever heard in radio.  On a whim.  We do stuff that gets us fired or arrested.  We've done the stupidest thing in radio probably six times at this point. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And two of them got us fired.  And a few others we were able to skate.  Thank God.  We could think that's out of our system.  Yeah.  Well, we're unpredictable.  Our faithful listeners know that.  Yeah.  But you listen to a show like Eric and Kathy in Chicago and like, why would you listen to  this drivel?  Horrid.  Is it background stuff as you're getting ready?  Background music or whatever?  If you're dropping your kids off, you could probably listen to it.  That's probably a lot of parents drop their kids off and listen to it.  Just get the info of the local weather.  It's probably on in a lot of the stores, the mall, things like that. 
[00:49:00]  Well, it's just God awful.  And we're about to play a little bit of audio.  And you're going to swear it's, like I said, Glenn and Rebecca from last week.  But no.  It's the same formula.  Like Anne said, the dude in a hole.  And they have this weird relationship where you almost feel like they might be dating.  Are they married?  But they have spouses.  But they have this relationship that's kind of like a marriage.  They're real close.  And they try to come off like, yeah.  What is that relationship? 
[00:49:30]  What is the host guy on a radio show and the hole?  It's like, yeah, we're going out.  We're married.  We're discussing things that like a couple that's going out would discuss.  You don't just walk up to a girl on the street and start talking about this, like I keep saying, drivel.  This garbage.  Look, man.  What are they?  Friends?  Good friends?  I love women.  And I love radio.  But I swear to you, if we had a chick on this show on a regular basis, I would go home and kill myself. 
[00:50:00]  I would kill myself.  Because this is like a clubhouse.  This is like a dream come true where you just get to hang out with your guy friends and get paid to do it.  Are you kidding me?  You don't have to mix and match everything you love.  Huh?  You don't have to mix and match everything.  Some things are better separate.  Yeah, absolutely.  I love oral sex.  I love egg salad.  Never together.  We don't mind talking about our girls from time to – very good.  Sorry, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  I should have let that just sit there for a little bit.  Trying to get better at that.  Very good.  But I got to be the guy.  I'll fill up the dead air.  Fill up the dead air.  Fill up the dead air.  Move on to the next thing.  Next thing.  Next thing.  Next thing.  How about you relax a bit every once in a while?  Jim says never, but I bet you would.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  If it was to cover something else up, yeah.  Let's say hi to Jay in Chicago listening to this fine program.  Jay, what's going on?  So you got some info on Eric and Kathy? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Well, first of all, I got to say I listen to you guys every morning.  I'm from Chicago.  I listen on XM because there's the hour delay that they got.  Yeah, that's kind of a problem, but that's that time thing.  Yeah.  We have nothing to do with that.  If there was no hour delay, you guys would be huge here.  I know a bunch of people, but if there was no hour delay, it'd just blow up.  All right.  Well, we got to figure that out.  Eric and Kathy, they got these billboards.  One, they got Bono.  He's like half the size of the billboard.  And it says, you too.  And then on their side, it says, and us too. 
[00:51:30]  And they're wearing the same shades.  And they look all like rocker.  And then they got one with Glenn Stefani.  Glenn Stefani on the other side.  And it says, rocker style.  And then the morning dial with them on the other side.  And I've never heard them.  I just hate them purely from their image alone.  Wow.  Just the billboards alone.  I'm looking at the billboards right now.  Yeah.  It's Bono on the left side of the billboard.  And then it's Eric and Kathy on the other side. 
[00:52:00]  And it says, you too and us too.  And they're all wearing the same sunglasses, trying to look hip.  The last one with Green Day on the left side of the billboard and Eric and Kathy on the right side.  And the slogan is, make up and wake up.  And they're wearing the same type of eye makeup that Green Day wears when they're performing.  Eric is very emu.  Emu Eric is what they call him.  Emu or emo.  Oh, you're not a say. 
[00:52:30]  Emu is not a big bird.  I'm sorry.  They should have them split on the billboard.  And they should have him wearing a Chicago Cubs uniform.  And it should say, Bunt.  And then have them.  There you go.  There's some Chicago humor for it.  See, we're helping him out.  Bunt.  He'd work in white socks with something else, I'm sure.  White socks.  She likes black.  All right.  Oh, wow. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, there's a picture of Albert Bell standing behind him with a hammer.  There's some Chicago humor for you.  Those are awful billboards.  Yeah, but they're kicking our ass.  I know.  That's what pisses me off.  Why?  Because it's like light FM here.  There's certain things that people can listen to anywhere.  And in stores and stuff like that.  And in offices, they can leave it out of the office.  Does that make it great?  Does that mean like restaurants should then serve oatmeal only because it's safe?  And everyone will get it because it's so safe and nice and good for you and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  Sometimes you want a good steak.  We're a steak.  What does it say about women?  Women don't have a sense of humor.  Yes.  This is what they like because I know guys aren't listening to this.  You know, guys are not listening to this type of radio.  What?  E-Rock keeps catching me.  I'm looking at the billboards.  And I don't even realize I'm doing it until E-Rock starts laughing.  I'm making the butthead face.  I'm just looking at it going like, uh, like I can't believe they really did this. 
[00:54:00]  They posed them like the people.  Oh, boy.  That they're supposed to look like.  Well.  Eric and Kathy.  Do you want to hear some Eric and Kathy audio?  What does the thing say above that on the top one?  Loud and laughter.  It says pink.  Pink on the left side of the billboard and Eric and Kathy on the other side.  See, and it says loud and laughter because pink is very loud and boisterous.  Oh, and they're funny.  Hold on.  They got a picture of pink with her mouth open. 
[00:54:30]  She's just getting wild.  And then on the other side of the billboard, uh, Kathy's got that same type of, uh, look  with Eric going, ah, like, shut up.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, now.  Shut up.  Why are you so loud?  Shut up, whore.  How great would it be if they had like Jake and Vicky LaMotta on one side and then Eric  and Kathy emulating that relationship on the other side.  Just giving her a right cross.  For Klaus von Bülow and Sonny, Eric and Kathy, OJ, Nicole.  How many beautiful?  Scott Peterson and Lacey. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  She's, she's got her nose.  She's like holding her nose with bubbles over her head and the oh, oh no face.  That silly, wacky, oh no face.  All right.  Plenty of other relationships they should have emulated.  All right.  Well, here we go for Chicago today.  This is a little taste of Eric and Kathy.  They got the big, uh, they got the big show opener.  It's unbelievable.  Big show opener?  Live from Chicago, it's the Eric and Kathy show.  Oh yeah.  If love is blind, then why is lingerie so popular? 
[00:55:30]  I get it.  No, I don't.  It covers up a world of hurt.  Oh God, is that fantastic.  I hate the way the guy goes, popular.  Papular.  And I'll tell you why lingerie is popular, by the way.  Because blind people can feel stupid.  Crotchless panties, you don't look at it.  It's the feel of them that's so sexy.  So that's why lingerie, you should have picked a better example. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Like eye makeup or why is makeup so popular?  Makeup and wake up.  Makeup and wake up, Jimmy.  Come on.  With the, uh, what's her name?  Oh, you know what?  You know what?  We need slogans.  That's what this show is missing.  We need slogans.  Hey, Kathy.  Whales are in the face of the shovel.  Wake up.  Kathy, how you doing?  I've been working with you for years.  I got one thing I want to do.  Cave your effing skull in. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, well.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, you got this classic.  Hey, hey, Kathy.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  Anyway, let's get back to the, uh, the fine opener here. 
[00:57:00]  Live from Chicago, it's the Eric and Kathy show.  If love is blind, then why is lingerie so popular?  Now, here they are, your hosts, Eric and Kathy.  Good point.  Uh-huh.  I like it.  Not a good point.  Good point.  Not a good point, a good joke, a good anything.  It's just not good.  Frankly, why don't you commit a good suicide? 
[00:57:30]  Stupid.  Stupid.  Ah, we're taking your, uh, billboard suggestions, let's see.  Wait, I want him to hit her in the head and then throw it through the window.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Kathy.  With a laugh track behind it.  Oh, Kathy.  Sick of you.  Yeah, you know what?  They're kicking our ass, though. 
[00:58:00]  I don't.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Joe and Jersey, what's up?  On the south side of Chicago, they're the high container billboard.  That is part of town.  On the other side, they got Eric beating her with the telephone.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Phil Spector in the middle going, eh.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's, uh, get back to the opener here.  Hey.  That's an interesting point.  Uh-huh.  I like it.  5.34 at the mix.  All right.  These flurries are all my fault.  I had to wash the car. 
[00:58:30]  Uh-huh.  Holy crap.  Why are we even...  It's my fault.  I had to wash the car.  You know what that does?  But his voice.  What is it with Chicago guys and the voice?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to wash the car.  Someone went back one over you.  It's very obvious what's going on here.  They're sick of doing radio.  They have no passion for it anymore.  You hear this all the time, no matter what city you're in.  They're like, they've been doing it for so long.  They get ratings because people are just used to, you know, a routine. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You can tell there's nothing between the two anymore.  And she's doing hack material like, blame the flurries on me because I washed the car yesterday.  I washed the car.  Whenever I wash the car, it rains or it snows or something.  Whenever I wash that car.  That was actually Susan Smith's excuse.  Hey, mommy.  They sound bored.  What if the brush is in the car wash? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, this is horrible.  All right, look.  Here we go.  I like it.  5.34 at the mix.  Hey, these flurries are all my fault.  I had to wash the car just in time for there to be enough snow to make the streets wet.  There you go.  The car is dirty.  Well, it would have happened later this week because it gets, you know, up into the 40s 
[01:00:00]  and 50s.  So it was all going to melt anyway, making all the streets wet.  So it was just a matter of time.  Kind of hoping for at least a good solid two days of a clean car.  But, oh well.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  It saw the sign. 
[01:00:30]  No one's going to tag you up.  You get into the lights where you belong.  I'm here to you belong.  Do they just do a break on flurries and dirty roads because it's going to melt?  I don't know what that was.  Make everything dirty?  It's the presentation, too.  It's just so...  I don't know what they are.  How about hitting us with a surprise?  Like, oh, the flurries.  Blame me.  I had a hysterectomy. 
[01:01:00]  God is punishing everybody.  Well, at least now you have a place to throw the snow after you shovel it.  Wow.  Sam took that audio and made him edgy.  Made it a little more unpredictable?  Unpredictable.  A little edgy.  Kind of bringing the Eric and Kathy show into our world.  Uh-huh.  Is what's going on here. 
[01:01:30]  Now, this is entertaining.  This is what I would listen to every morning.  Just a slight change in the exact same break you heard.  Live from Chicago, it's the Eric and Kathy show.  If love is blind, then why is lingerie so popular?  Now, here they are, your hosts, Eric and Kathy.  That's an interesting point.  Uh-huh.  I like it.  5.34 at the mix.  All right, these f***s are all my fault.  I had to wash the f***s. 
[01:02:00]  Uh-huh.  Just in time for there to be enough f***s to make the f***s wet.  There you go.  Dirty.  Well, it would have happened later this week.  Kind of hoping for at least a good salad f***s.  Uh-huh.  Oh, well.  Yeah, there you go.  And here's how he responded to her.  He went, uh-huh.  There you go.  And, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  You know.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I...  Uh-huh. 
[01:02:30]  And what is with the mix?  Shut up.  The mix.  The mix.  The mix.  There's a mix in every freaking town in America.  How long is his S's?  Uh-huh.  Five-thirty-four at the mix.  The mix.  Yeah.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Yeah.  There sucks.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Sure.  Uh-huh.  What'd you say?  Not listening to you.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah.  You got some more?  All right.  Well, you want another clip real fast? 
[01:03:00]  More than I want oxygen.  Okay.  Let's, uh...  Someone's like,  Stop making fun of competition.  Shut up.  Go freaking listen and, uh,  wake up with Whoopi or something.  Actually, he said,  Stop complaining about the competition.  Complaining.  This is complaining?  This is a...  This is having a pisser.  Is that decent feedback?  Yeah.  Of course.  No, it's a...  Actually, it was a phone call,  and the guy bailed.  It's just having fun with the competition  because they suck so bad.  That's right.  We just got 15 minutes of good material out of it. 
[01:03:30]  What happened?  I don't know.  What happened?  I saw your old station there.  What old station?  Uh, they just showed, uh, uh,  B-A-B.  Oh, what?  Your old, uh, station there.  What dumb thing did they do this time?  I don't know,  but they showed the board and the meters.  You know, the standard,  whenever a radio station is featured on the news,  they have to show the meters moving.  All right, well,  find out what that's about.  And the board, yeah.  All right, here we go.  More Eric and Kathy.  Well, this ought to be nice here  to try to figure this out.  What?  Dana from Oswego  sending in this morning's  Hey, I was wondering question. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, Eric, uh,  yesterday was such a windy day.  It was odd.  I went to the bathroom at work  and noticed that the water in the toilet  was sloshing around.  No.  That's what she says.  That's odd.  Water in the toilet was sloshing around.  Huh.  I was wondering,  why does the water in the toilet  slosh around on windy days?  Uh-oh.  What?  I can't seem to come up  with a logical explanation for this.  It's dope.  I was wondering, thanks, Dana.  I wonder where she works.  I don't know.  I've never seen that before.  You ever notice that dynamic before?  Here's why, by the way. 
[01:04:30]  See, we're not trying.  We're trying.  I was going to say we're not trying,  which is so stupid.  We're trying too hard.  We've just got to do dumb, stupid things.  The beds they use are just awful.  Steven Ferbace or Kathy is to blame  for the snow in Chicago.  She once kissed a Negro.  Yikes.  I believe when the wind blows over 
[01:05:00]  the vent pipes on top of your house  that vent the plumbing system,  the pressure changes.  And when the pressure changes,  the water will slosh around.  Just had to answer the question.  I never noticed that.  Just in case anybody...  But I like the fact that the woman  who wrote in is on her hands and knees  staring at the toilet water  doing little Richter measurements  before she uses it.  How about you just sit  and then shut your face?  Why does it swirl  after I hit that little silver thing  on the side  and all of my goodies go away? 
[01:05:30]  Goodies.  Well, let me answer that.  Do they answer it?  Is that what they do?  Yeah, I was trying to find something, though.  Yes, I think he did answer it.  But the answer was,  ah, because I work with a hole?  I've got a hole here.  I don't know.  Ah?  Yeah.  Ah, the timing's everything.  I couldn't find it in time.  Never mind.  All right, here's that same break  as we bring him into our world. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Making him edgy.  Making him funny, actually.  Yeah, we'll help him out.  Same break,  you're going to get some chuckles out of it.  Well, this ought to be nice here  to try to figure this out.  What?  Dana from Oswego  sending in this morning's  hey, I was wondering question.  Hey, Eric,  yesterday was such a windy day.  It was odd.  I went to the bathroom  to the f*** at work  and noticed that the f***  in the toilet  was sloshing around.  No.  That's what she says.  That's odd.  The f*** in the toilet  was sloshing around.  Huh.  I was wondering  why does the f***  in the toilet  slosh around on windy days? 
[01:06:30]  Uh-oh.  What?  I can't seem to come up  with a logical explanation for this.  Hmm.  I was wondering,  thanks, Dana.  I wonder where she works.  I don't know.  Christine?  Never seen the f*** before.  Never noticed that f*** before?  I can kind of tell  what that word's supposed to be  when you believe it.  Do you listen  to what her responses are?  I wonder where she works.  But, oh, uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just nonsense.  Yeah.  It is nonsense.  It is nonsense. 
[01:07:00]  So, you were with  the funny-looking one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Chicago's on our radar.  He was kind of funny-looking.  We got a nice little bump up  in the trend.  Nothing to brag about,  but we're moving  in the right direction,  and now we got to start focusing  on why a show  like Eric and Kathy  does so well in Chicago.  I wonder if I sected.  What are we doing wrong?  Do we need to do more?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Where do they work?  I don't know.  Let me ask you another question 
[01:07:30]  that means nothing.  It was,  I wonder where she works.  Why would that matter?  Think about that.  There's a question,  even though the whole thing  is lame,  but this woman poses a question  about the toilet water  where she works  sloshing on windy days.  That's the question.  She goes,  I wonder where she works.  Like, that matters.  It doesn't matter  if she's a hooker  or the president  of Smith Barney.  It's a stupid question.  It doesn't matter.  It's amazing. 
[01:08:00]  What?  I wonder where she works.  My car broke down  as I was driving home yesterday.  I wonder if she has sunglasses.  That's exactly  how much relevance that had.  Yeah.  I wonder where she works.  Well, we got Allie in Florida.  Allie,  you want to defend women in radio?  Well, yeah.  I mean,  a lot of them do suck.  I mean,  I'll give you that.  Uh-huh.  But just, I mean,  not all of them.  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Sure. 
[01:08:30]  And there are couples  that are pretty freaking funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, okay.  Like who?  Mm-hmm.  There was a lady down here,  but she got fired.  Why did she get fired?  Oh, God,  I hope it was for something good.  Because she was so good.  Yes.  Was she driving drunk  and hit a strip club?  She probably got fired  because she decided  to have a kid.  Yeah.  Women will do that.  I actually remember that show.  It was Yates in the morning. 
[01:09:00]  No, nothing good.  Actually,  the station just got,  I guess,  changed over,  but nothing good.  I just wanted to admit  that maybe some of them  are okay.  I have found a one.  I don't know.  They play the same role  in general.  They're like these holes  that just kind of like,  just do cute,  happy stuff  that is just babble.  Not all the time.  Most times.  Just about every single time.  Just about.  All right,  this calls me from nowhere,  so I'm going to punch out. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Too late.  Where's the edgy women in radio?  How come there's no ballsy women  or edgy women in radio  that you hear?  They're all the same.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Yep.  He tolerates her as they start.  Okay.  I was going to wash the car  and I watched the shut up.  Shut up is right.  Dude, if we, you know,  look, we do some dumb things. 
[01:10:00]  All right, let's acknowledge that.  But we try our asses off  and if one of us came in  and said,  well, blame the rain  or the snow on me  because I washed my car yesterday.  I washed the car.  You would look at that person  and go,  are you insane?  Blame the snow on me.  Got AIDS.  That's right.  That's God's frozen tears  falling on the city.  Well, let's go to Robert  in Buffalo.  Robert,  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Robert.  Good morning from Buffalo.  Hey, that lady was worried  about her toilet water  going up and down.  Too many volumes there,  no doubt. 
[01:10:30]  I was like to get up  and find her toilet  frozen in the morning.  Huh?  Does that happen?  I got up this morning  and my wood burner  was all over.  My water was frozen.  My toilet was frozen.  That was no fun at all.  Huh?  So what did you do?  I wonder what kind of TV he has.  I live kind of out in the woods  and I had to drive 13 miles  to a McDonald's.  Oh, so you couldn't  actually use it.  It would have looked like  Malcolm Jamal Warner  dozing off  on an icy pond.  It would have looked like  a giant cupcake  with a Hershey kiss on top.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Thank you, Robert. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Good topical black eye reference.  Malcolm Jamal Warner.  I should be shot.  You might be.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We're paying attention  to Eric and Kathy today.  We'll have more audio  in just a bit.  And, uh, up next,  we're going to attempt  to get the, uh,  a new story of the month.  This I got to hear  because to be story of the month,  it has to, uh,  be really out there.  We'll do it next.  It's right here.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Right. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Let's get right back into it.  You're checking out  the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus  spreading across America  slowly but surely.  Uh, our phone number,  1-866-313-FREE.  If you want to play  the bleep game,  E-Rock, you came up  with a good idea  and then you,  you take it off my screen here.  There you go.  We're making fun  of Eric and Kathy this week.  Oh, I know we're going  after the tough targets.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, we know that.  We'll get to some 
[01:12:00]  of the heavy hitters  eventually.  But it's too much fun  to make fun of these,  like, you know,  man-woman teams.  Yeah.  The lame, typical radio crap.  It's all about  Eric and Kathy this week.  WTMX.com.  They got podcasts  and you can play  the bleep game at home  and send them in to us,  okay?  Ooh.  All right, we got  story of the month. 
[01:12:30]  We started with a doozy,  so it's going to be,  it's going to be tough  to beat the one  we started with.  Just in case you missed it,  once again,  it's a story out of  Allentown, PA.  This cute little thing.  The arrest itself  of a middle school principal  selling drugs  out of his office,  well, that's unbelievable  and bizarre enough.  But what we've learned  tonight,  some police sources say,  is shocking.  Well, I'm not going to  comment on the circumstances  of his arrest.  But it's the circumstances 
[01:13:00]  during the arrest  of 50-year-old John Ossera  that makes this case  incredibly bizarre.  As we first reported,  police arrested  the Nitschman Middle School  principal on drug charges  at his office  Tuesday night.  But that's only  part of the story.  Tonight,  police sources tell me  cops were shocked  and in disbelief  when they stormed  his office.  Sources say,  not only did they  find drugs,  money,  and a pipe,  they also found  Asera completely nude  and watching gay porn  with sex toys 
[01:13:30]  in his possession.  I can't have  a little fun.  Come on.  Look, out there,  radio.  This goes a hard job.  Out there in radio land,  you've heard that  probably three or four times.  That means we've heard it  about ten times  and it still makes me laugh.  Cops walking in.  Oh, there he is.  This guy is just a mess  on so many levels.  Going to town  like a monkey.  You know why he's a mess?  He could do all those  things from his house.  Yeah.  But he just can't.  He can't wait.  The urge is so strong.  Yeah.  He's got to do it 
[01:14:00]  all right there.  Got to be here  in the office.  Let me just,  yeah, I'll do it here.  I'll say,  what can happen?  Who's going to walk in?  The police?  He doesn't even have time.  He's so, like,  addicted.  He doesn't even have time  to, like,  lock his door.  Yeah, how about  locking the door?  Because you know  they didn't, like,  just knock the door down.  Doesn't anyone  effing knock anymore?  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Hamilton.  He answered like that,  you know,  remote in one hand,  walking like a penguin  so he's wearing the sex toys.  All right,  so that is your story 
[01:14:30]  of the month  for March so far.  Yeah.  We're going to offer  this little story today,  and it's up to you.  You can use instant feedback.  The pal talkers  can help us out,  certainly.  You can call us.  Does this beat  the story you just heard?  It's got some fine features,  I'll tell you that much.  This is coming in  from Minneapolis.  Minneapolis.  She took off  around midnight  from Seattle,  headed back to college.  She told her boyfriend  she sat in the aisle seat  and closed her eyes. 
[01:15:00]  It was really shocking  to get the phone call  this morning,  and it made me really upset.  Near the end of the flight,  the FBI says  20-year-old Oscar Gonzalez  sat next to the woman  as she was trying to sleep.  He touched her,  which she described  as spooning,  and lifted her shirt.  As Gonzalez walked away,  she felt a warm fluid  on her back,  clothes, and feet.  She told the officers  he did s*** on her.  Wow.  Her back,  clothes, and feet.  And feet.  Wow.  Oscar had waited  a few weeks. 
[01:15:30]  Nice and pent up there.  Wow.  So she's...  But the guy  started spooning with her?  Yeah, that should have  been the first sign.  Yeah, unless you're  traveling together  and in love or something,  it just seems a little odd  to have  some guy come up  and spoon you  and you don't go,  hey, buddy,  what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Oscar,  where do you think  you're going to go?  You're on a plane.  Like, what do you think  is going to happen? 
[01:16:00]  Now I'll make good  my escape.  Aisle 24.  Aisle 24.  I stink.  Yeah, well.  Oops.  What is he thinking?  I can see doing that  on a train  where you can get off  and just run down  the platform.  And then you get  on the train.  Like what?  Doing it on a train,  great escape style?  No, no, but I'm saying  at least the subway  is going to stop.  At least you know  you're stopping.  At some point  it's stopping  in various locations. 
[01:16:30]  She had to be into it.  I don't know, man.  Was she fast asleep  the entire time?  She knew the guy  was spooning with her.  She said the guy  was spooning with her  and pulling up her shirt.  Does she know the guy?  Maybe she just felt him  behind her and said,  stop it.  Maybe that was  the first indication.  He might have just  sat next to her,  spooned and went up  her shirt and she freaked out.  Got right to the point  of no return.  Have you ever touched?  And then uses that  to spoon and then  lift the shirt  and by the time  she can even say,  what are you doing? 
[01:17:00]  Her feet are wet.  Her feet?  Her feet, her back,  her clothes.  What do you have  an epileptic fit  while it's happening?  God, aim, sir.  Aim.  Jesus.  The flight crew  must have thought  a fuel line broke.  Have you ever touched  another, like,  well, have you ever  touched a stranger  on a plane before?  In what way?  That's what I mean.  How does it get to that point?  Brushing against somebody  as you're trying  to get out of a seat?  Sure. 
[01:17:30]  Spooning with somebody  and then, uh...  Spooning with a stranger?  Making a mess?  Uh, well, let's, uh...  There's a little more  to the story.  Let's, uh,  let's see what else  is going on here.  I know she's really upset  and, um, just  kind of confused  with what's going on  and what's happening.  She told the flight attendants.  They called the police  from the air.  Airport officers  interviewed Gonzalez  at the gate.  I'm really upset right now.  Um, I really don't know  how to express it  like in words.  The woman told her boyfriend  she was told  Gonzalez is a Northwest employee. 
[01:18:00]  Northwest released  a statement today.  The NWA employee  has been suspended  pending a review  of the incident.  Northwest is cooperating  fully with law enforcement  authorities on this matter.  Gonzalez was not working  on the flight.  He was traveling  as a passenger.  Neither the FBI  nor Northwest  would tell us  what he does  for the airline.  Baggage handler.  Yeah, or cabin cleanup.  I hope it was the pilot.  He was just tired.  He's the pilot. 
[01:18:30]  It has to be,  maybe, I don't know.  He's just crazy.  You can't expect  to get away with that.  But the girl.  What's up with that?  Allowing this guy to spoon.  There had to be  some kind of relationship  there, I'm thinking.  I bet you spooning  just meant the way  he sat with her  because she never  would have ratted him out  if she was partially  into it.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I think maybe her boyfriend  asked if she was  painting on the plane.  Yeah, what happened to you?  Exactly.  Well, what do you say?  What do you say? 
[01:19:00]  Story of the month material?  What do you say?  That's a pretty good one.  Yeah?  The guy's, uh,  the guy obviously  wasn't thinking.  Thinking things through.  That's one of those  situations where, you know,  you gotta do what you gotta do.  It's the perv switch  all over again.  The perv switch  goes off in your head  and it's over.  He was probably  looking at her  that whole flight  just going,  oh my god,  I gotta do this to her.  How am I gonna,  oh look,  she's rolling over  to go to sleep  a little bit.  Right.  She's taking a little nap. 
[01:19:30]  She probably was like,  you know,  had her whole body  pushed up on the seat,  like kind of holding  her knees  and then maybe  a little butt crack.  Oops!  Yeah, maybe seeing  a little thong  sticking out.  A slight oopsie.  A little oopsie.  A little oopsie.  Unintentional oopsie  got him going.  Sees her lower back  maybe and just thinks,  I could just  work this here  and then wait  right until, you know,  the last minute  and kind of...  By the way,  there's people out there  confused because of the beat.  Oh, it is what you're thinking.  How the hell 
[01:20:00]  can anyone be confused  by this?  Some people are thinking  it might be  the other thing  that, you know...  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God,  but no,  it's the number one  crazy thing.  Yeah, it's a crazy thing.  It's a guy that wanted  to make himself  feel nice.  Yeah.  Her back looked like  the construction worker's  hard hat  in the Elmer's commercial.  Boy, that would be  crazy glue.  Elmer's.  Elmer's.  Elmer's.  Elmer's.  I would have plunged 
[01:20:30]  to his death  if he tried that  with Elmer's.  Ass I am.  Let's go to D.C.  Hey, Greg,  what's up today?  Morning, guys.  Good morning.  I was actually  on a Southwest flight  from D.C.  up to Seattle.  I sat next to this  really attractive  Asian woman,  tried to talk to her.  She just looked at me  and went,  Thailand,  and couldn't say  much else.  It was kind of cold,  so I grabbed a blanket,  covered the two of us up.  About a half hour later,  my hand brushed up  against hers  under the blanket, 
[01:21:00]  and she grabbed my hand.  So she starts  holding my hand,  and I became Jimmy.  I just got...  All right, wait, wait, wait.  I think people  understand,  so I want to slow you down,  because this is...  Oh, yeah, no, no.  I don't want to...  You didn't know this girl.  You met her  on the flight, obviously.  You're covering her up,  and she grabs your hand  because you brushed  it up against her, right?  Yeah, to show...  I guess...  I'm assuming, obviously,  that she grabbed my hand  because she just  thought I was cute, too.  So I'm holding her hand, 
[01:21:30]  and I'm holding her hand  on her inner thigh.  Then her hand  leaves my hand  and goes...  Ah!  I'm trying to save you.  My knee.  Oh, your knee.  On your knee.  My knee.  Don't worry, Al.  Don't worry, Al.  Oh, Al.  Al got up off his seat.  Trust me, he's just staring.  He's just staring  at that button  with a finger.  He's waiting.  Al's waiting.  Eric and Kathy.  What do you say, Al?  That's what makes this fun. 
[01:22:00]  I want to see how far  and how intelligent  some of these listeners are.  So far, so good,  I believe, Greg.  All right.  All right.  So I start...  My hand is on her thigh,  and I am...  I'm making circles.  All right.  She then,  with her hand on my knee,  it starts to make circles also.  On your knee?  Mm-hmm.  On my knee.  Well, I've heard Jimmy talk about  his massage routine  on The Tonight Show 
[01:22:30]  and how he likes to scooch.  Yes, he scooched down.  So I scooched.  Ah, you gave a little signal.  I gave a very distinct signal,  and she scooched.  So if the hand doesn't move,  your body can.  It's like, let me just...  All right.  Exactly.  Gotcha.  It's the old...  Now, we're in a row  where there are three people seated. 
[01:23:00]  So I'm on the aisle.  She's in the middle,  and there's actually a guy  against the window  while the two of us  have a blanket over us.  The guy at the window,  any clue?  No.  The guy at the window  pretty much asleep  as far as I know.  It was a flight,  so you couldn't hear  garments rattling,  as garments do  when sometimes  they are withdrawn.  Mm-hmm.  Jimmy's loving you today, man. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, this is great.  This plays right into Jimmy.  Well, actually,  it's a good story for everybody.  Yeah, what guy wouldn't like that?  Yeah, this is a good story  for everybody.  Trust me,  I could not believe  it was happening  the entire time.  I kept,  every once in a while,  I would look around  like someone watching  so I can at least,  you know,  tell everyone,  yes, this did happen.  You want a record  of the incident.  Oh, yeah.  You want one guy  to kind of turn around  and give you the thumbs up  like, dude,  I know what's going on  behind me here. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  Just one person  to acknowledge,  dude,  you're a god.  so we're sitting there  and the amount of time  it took to go from  circles on the knees  to scooching  was about a half hour.  Of course.  Yeah,  this is just taking,  it's going very slow  but you got a lot of time  in the air  so you're not,  exactly.  It's kind of like the build up  is kind of part  of the excitement there.  Where was the flight from?  You better hope  it wasn't like a  North to Pittsburgh flight.  No,  it was D.C. to Seattle  so we had  five and a half hours. 
[01:24:30]  Nice.  Plenty of times.  It was an hour before  D.C. to Seattle.  Yeah,  it was an hour  before I brushed her hand  and another half hour  before we start  doing the circle  so we've got  like four hours  left in this flight  and the stewards  are walking around  doing the  would you like a drink,  would you like a drink thing.  Yeah.  So I've got a knee up  so that you've got  that tent  and no one can really  see what's going on  and she's making 
[01:25:00]  eye contact with me  and smiling  and she'd nod her head  every once in a while.  Greg,  Greg,  Greg,  you're doing a great job  but you're not going to  tell this story  in real time,  are you?  No,  no,  no,  no.  We're kind of heading  in that direction.  A little bit like Montana  at this point.  Yeah,  right.  And then the captain  noted.  I want to do a walkover  with you guys too.  I'll get to the good part  of the walkover.  Seatbelt light came on.  Right.  And then I was kind of thirsty  so I figured what the hell  I'll have a drink.  So I was waiting  for the stewardess.  Waiting,  waiting, 
[01:25:30]  waiting.  After all the drinks  are done  and they tell everyone  they're going to go ahead  and turn the lights out  because it is a later flight.  The lights go down.  Hold on,  can I get into your head  at that point?  Please.  When they turn the lights  down for the movie,  this is what you felt inside.  Here it comes.  Oh,  we're ready to go.  The lights are out.  I was hoping.  Yeah.  What I ended up getting  was,  now, 
[01:26:00]  in a normal situation  you would hope  that there would be  kissing involved.  Okay.  We can say kissing.  Yeah,  that's really part of company  by the way.  That's the last thing  I want,  but go ahead.  Well,  I was hoping that there  would be kissing involved.  Yeah,  he's hoping there would be  kissing involved  where the type of kissing  he would still be able  to recite  the Gettysburg Address.  Somewhere around Tijuana.  Wow.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Okay.  So,  I was hoping for kissing  in Tijuana.  What I got instead  was a nice demonstration 
[01:26:30]  of how a yo-yo works.  Excellent.  There you go.  See?  And because we were  on a plane,  and as we all know,  yo-yos are very dry.  It's just a string  and a yo-yo.  All right.  All right.  Yeah,  be careful now.  Be careful.  No,  there's just a string  and a yo-yo.  What do you say,  Al?  Yeah,  I think you might have  lost this right there.  Did that triangle move hurt?  Oh,  okay.  Well,  okay.  Well,  honestly,  I think we got the picture.  So,  after you guys 
[01:27:00]  or whatever.  Well,  here's the best part.  When we got done,  the blanket was  simply used  to be folded back up.  Yeah.  Ah,  just fold it up  and put it back in the...  Was it hard to fold  at that point?  It was like a canopy.  Who the hell's  going to tell  the flight attendant?  You might want to...  Perhaps if you'd lost this.  You might want to  shove this down the toilet  and let it just fly  out of the plane 
[01:27:30]  over my head.  Throw it out there,  yeah.  The next guy used it  and walked off the flight  and the blanket  was stuck to the side  of his face.  Well,  when we got done...  That's why I don't  touch those blankets  unless they're in  that plastic still.  When we got done,  I gave her my email address  and I just...  I handed her the email address  and I went,  here?  Hoping that at least  everybody knows  what something in front  of an amber sand  and then something else  means it's an email address.  Yeah.  I got an email from her  about three months later  and it was in really  broken English  and it said, 
[01:28:00]  this is from a friend of mine.  Please don't contact me.  my husband found out.  How did the husband  find out?  I think that she told him.  I have no idea.  I still actually  have the email address.  Yeah.  He beat it out of her.  There you go.  There's a nice story.  Good for you, man.  Yes.  It was a nice story.  I'm glad I got there  with you gentlemen  this morning.  Little Jimmy,  you were fantastic  in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Thank you for coming out there.  I'll be in Pittsburgh  this weekend  so if you're around,  why would you go from there?  I'm sorry.  It's another Pennsylvania hack.  Yeah, we drove all the way  up from D.C. 
[01:28:30]  because you canceled  your D.C. gig  but I would love to be  in Pittsburgh this weekend.  I just can't be.  Thank you.  Let's take a flight together.  Godspeed.  That's pretty cool  that I drove from D.C.  to see you there.  Yeah, it was very cool.  All right, Greg.  Great.  Sorry, I didn't mean  to do that.  I hung up on it.  Thanks, sweetie.  But Greg, great story  and he knew how to tell it.  That was very good.  He was going to wake up  and have a kidney missing  or some urban legend like that.  I'm going to guess  Al dumped just one time.  Yeah.  Al couldn't help himself.  He got a little nervous  on the trigger there.  How sexy is that story?  That really was a turn-on.  Like that and the Ralph Fiennes story 
[01:29:00]  where he had sex  with the stewardess  in the bathroom  on that Qantas flight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's some hot stories, man.  Well, he finally broke up  with that old broad  so he's going to go nuts now.  There's just nowhere to go  on a plane.  You're in your seat  and if you're found out,  that's it.  You know, there's a bathroom.  If you're found out, though,  that's it.  So it makes it ultra dangerous  that you're going to get caught.  And going into the bathroom,  I mean,  I don't understand that.  There's a lot of people  getting into a bathroom. 
[01:29:30]  It just ain't happening anymore.  You're all worked up  and you know you want  to get into that bathroom, right?  With somebody?  Yeah.  I just don't know  how you pull off that move.  You keep staring at the bathroom.  You know that's where  you want to go.  But two-ies have to get in there.  That's what I'm saying.  And they're so conscious  of who's where,  especially up by the...  Especially after 9-11.  Yeah, and especially  near the cockpit.  So you get up there  and what are you going to...  I got to help her out.  All of a sudden,  you just got to take a deep breath  and just go. 
[01:30:00]  I just...  I could never get it  to that point.  On a night flight,  you probably could though  because they really get dark  on the plane  and the flight attendants  are relaxed.  They don't think  anything crazy.  If you're an hour and a half  into a flight  and you get like  you're both by the doors  chit-chatting  and like say most of the doors  are open...  like on an afternoon flight  where everybody's waiting  for the toilet,  you can't get in.  And you wouldn't want to afterwards.  Yeah, this is a great experience, baby.  Trying to close the lid,  you can't.  Oh boy.  A morning flight to Atlanta.  Just like... 
[01:30:30]  They're lined up  to do all sorts  of horrific things  in there.  Someone had the chicken.  Got to deal with Mr. Selfish.  He had to have a chili dog  before the flight  so we all have to suffer.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You couldn't help yourself.  You had to have like  chicken wings  and skim milk.  Thanks.  Nothing worse  than someone coming  out of that bathroom  and the whole like cabin  just fills up.  You want to open  the door at 30,000 feet? 
[01:31:00]  All right.  We got to step aside.  So, story of the month?  It's up there, man.  Yeah, that could be a candidate.  Steve's saying no way  for Michigan.  That's not story of the month.  He still goes with  the high school guy.  The high school guy  is crazy and dirty  but he was alone.  I mean, any of us  could have done that.  I mean, to do that on a plane  when you're an employee?  Yeah.  But this guy was in his office  at work with the door unlocked.  Selling drugs.  Smoking drugs.  Like it has a lot of features to it.  This guy is sick pervert. 
[01:31:30]  Watching gay porn.  But he was on a plane.  With marital devices.  There was just so many  things going on there.  Spooning up with someone  and just leaving that on them  is the only...  You should only do that  if your plane is going down.  Like if you're having  some type of a crash  just saddle up to  whoever you feel like it.  Yeah.  And just go ahead.  What are you going to do?  Tell someone?  We're hitting the cornfield.  I guess it's better  than sitting there  and doing it  to a Dakota Fanning movie  on the screen.  War of the Worlds 
[01:32:00]  and you get lucky  because the captain  starts talking  so it pauses on a scene  where she's...  Looking like a minx.  All right.  We'll take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else  is talking about.  O&A Uncut  and live  continuing the show  on XM Satellite Radio  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com  to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony! 
[01:32:30]  Hey, what's up, man?  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show?  We have more  Eric and Kathy audio.  The last clip for today.  Yeah.  Don't want to push it.  Don't want to put fun  to it, though.  No.  Enjoy it.  Of course.  We got some  all right news  out of Chicago yesterday.  Did all right  in a little ratings trend.  Got a long ways to go.  We know that.  So we're kind of  paying attention 
[01:33:00]  to some of the radio  in Chicago  and this Eric and Kathy  ends up on our  radar from time to time  and we just don't  understand why Chicago  would tune into this  god-awful show  and there's a show  like this in every city  and they do very well  and I just don't get it.  I like to give the people  more credit.  I understand that people  have different tastes  and all that.  I know.  I know this show's  not for everyone.  I get all that.  But when you listen  to a radio show  that's just so predictable  and they're not doing  anything really  thought-provoking  or edgy 
[01:33:30]  and their jokes  are all old-school crap.  I just  have dumb little contests  and little trivia questions  like who got kicked off  American Idol last night.  Call us up.  You'll win a prize.  Jay in Chicago,  what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I'm glad to hear  that you guys are taking  a radio spike  taking some more  of the market.  A little bit,  a little bit.  I'm sure that stupid  Federer guy  or Federer  or Feeder 
[01:34:00]  or whatever the hell  his name is in Chicago  will have something  stupid to say about it.  But we did show  a little growth.  We have a long ways to go.  But is he going to  acknowledge that?  Of course not.  You know what?  I would like to touch  on something Steve said.  Steve Dalton said  his ideal show  for Free FM  would be having you guys  not on a delay.  That way we can get  more involved  in your show.  Well, they've got to  work that out up there.  That would be nice.  We agree with Steve Dalton.  We have no problem  doing 7 to 10 for you guys  because with the time difference  that's how it would work out. 
[01:34:30]  And you know what?  It kills me  because I can't call in the show  I've been listening  for the last few months  and then all of a sudden  I find out you're on  a time delay  and I'm like...  Oh, wait.  Is it the other way?  Yeah, I think you're wrong.  Oh, yeah.  It goes 5 to 8.  5 to 8.  Yeah.  It's going to be perfect.  Yeah.  That's somewhere out  in the Atlantic.  It would because,  you know what?  Most people aren't listening  to the radio right at 5  but at 6  when everybody gets up  boom, they can interact  and they're on their commute.  Here's the problem  with that theory.  We only do 3 hours  to begin with  and then one of the hours  is wasted in the middle  of the night.  That's like John and Jeff  third shift. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, that's John and Jeff  time zone crap.  Love that show.  It's unfortunate.  I mean, us in the Midwest  we'd like to get more involved.  I mean, I love the show.  Looking forward  to the O&A virus  this summer.  Isn't that odd  that he got more involved?  Yeah, he certainly did.  He called.  Now what's he going to do  later on?  Listen?  I don't know how that works.  You should talk really slow  so they can just replay  the last hour.  Yeah.  They'll figure it out up there.  How about this?  We do one bit  in the 8 o'clock hour  and then do 54 minutes 
[01:35:30]  of commercials  and then just do that  for Chicago.  Be a hit.  All right.  One more clip  from Eric and Kathy.  Any observations there,  young Sam?  This one's a good one.  This is Sam's baby.  I was telling him  before when he came in.  I go,  you are just let it ride, guy.  He's the guy  that goes to the track,  bets on the first race  and wins  and then just goes  right back to the window.  Let it ride.  Let it ride.  Because all these  that he's done so far  have been really good. 
[01:36:00]  They've turned out well.  It just takes one, though.  Yeah.  It just takes one  and we turn on you  and go,  well,  I guess that bit's over.  It's a good one.  And we're encouraging  the listeners  to do the bleep game, too.  You go to WTMX.com  and check out  some Eric and Kathy audio  and have fun  adding the bleeps  to make him edgy.  Kathy.  It brings him  into our world.  Ew.  All right,  here's actual audio  from this god-awful show  this morning.  We were talking  over the weekend,  Wild Hogs,  number one 
[01:36:30]  at the box office.  More than dumb music.  They play music  that's 80 years old.  It's like Laurel and Hardy  background music.  Brr-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.  Hi.  How you doing, Kathy?  You know,  these dumb...  Very good.  These dumb morning shows,  they add the audio  to make it  a little more interesting.  Spice it up.  Because even they know  what they're talking  about is just horse crap.  Anything you can do  to spice it up.  Sure.  We were talking  over the weekend.  Wild Hogs.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:37:00]  Number one  at the box office.  Rocking the box office.  38 million bucks.  Whoa, who knew?  And there was something in USA Today yesterday about how it was majority women.  Yeah.  Like 54% were women.  Well, I remember we talked to a bunch of women yesterday who said it was like wet yourself hysterical.  They liked it a lot.  Laugh out that funny.  And I wanted to go see it and then saw all the horrible reviews, and I'm usually a guy that ignores that kind of thing, but I paid attention.  I'm thinking, well, maybe they're right.  You're not even a guy.  No, you're castrated. 
[01:37:30]  You're not even a guy.  Let's start there.  You're a broad with the wrong genitals.  Yeah.  Wow.  As a guy, because I've got to represent the guy.  I represent the guys.  You represent the girls.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how the show's got to work.  That's our dynamic.  Funny.  And I wanted to go see it and then saw all the horrible reviews, and I'm usually a guy that ignores that kind of thing, but I paid attention.  I'm thinking, well, maybe they're right.  Maybe they're stupid.  So now I'm kicking myself, so I'm definitely going.  Maybe even today.  I really wish the critics would have more of a sense of humor.  I'm going to soak up some hogs maybe today.  There you go.  Well, that's a little risque. 
[01:38:00]  Why would you go soak up some hogs?  Some hogs.  What a – oh, God.  I don't know what to even say about that.  That is awful.  They just did a break on wild hogs and then said it was funny but never explained why it was like –  Dude, laugh out loud funny, she said.  See, when you do a radio show and you go, wow, I saw wild hogs and it was blank yourself funny, then you explain why it was that funny. 
[01:38:30]  You don't just say that because that's just – that means nothing.  It means nothing to their listeners.  You've got to explain yourself.  Well, Sam took that audio and made it a little edgier.  Well, they got pretty edgy toward the end of that, so I –  Bringing Eric and Kathy into our world, we make them funny.  We make them funny.  That's what we do. 
[01:39:00]  Same clip.  It's just a little different.  We were talking over the weekend, wild hogs, rocking the –  Whoa, who knew?  And there was something in USA Today yesterday about how it was majority women.  Yeah.  Like 54% were women.  Well, I remember we talked to a bunch of women yesterday who said it was like wet yourself.  They liked it.  And I wanted to go and then saw all the reviews and I'm usually a guy that ignores but I paid attention.  I'm thinking, well, maybe they're right.  Maybe it is.  So now I'm myself, so I'm definitely going. 
[01:39:30]  Maybe even today.  I'm going to up some hogs maybe today.  There you go.  I like them with the beefs.  Yeah.  It's definitely funny, man.  They're definitely better.  I think the bit's still going strong.  Yeah.  I really do.  Thank you, Sam.  Young Sam, everyone.  Go rock some hogs.  Hey, MacBook Karaoke's back.  Ooh, good.  The promo pretty much kills the bit but –  Did you just hear what a hole I turned into? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, good.  I know.  Ooh, good.  I'm all conscious.  I'm all self-conscious now.  I don't want to sound like the hole.  Yeah.  So I'm just not saying anything.  In between.  Like, oh, really?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you don't say, right?  Oh, gosh.  Oh, gee.  You willikers.  What a company dork I've turned into.  I was actually psyched that you mentioned Mac.  Ooh.  I switched from PC, and I really do love it.  Like, I want to just kick my PC right out of this stupid window.  So I'm so happy that you mentioned that one. 
[01:40:30]  Ooh, good.  Ooh, Mac.  Well, here we go.  I love it.  MacBook Karaoke.  What you got to do is go to www.923freefm.com for details.  Win the new MacBook.  Sleek and sexy.  Create everything from music, movies, greeting cards, podcasts, websites, and more.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out for yourself.  And we're looking for the next karaoke star.  Of course, that's how we got this fine clip.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign. 
[01:41:00]  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  But where do you belong?  We're hoping to get another star like that.  What are the odds?  You got to go to www.923freefm.com for all the details on MacBook Karaoke, okay? 
[01:41:30]  She's like the biggest star in any karaoke contest.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know who's going to top that.  Well, we do the O&A Traveling Virus this summer.  And we bring her to a show to do that live in front of like 10,000 people.  She's going to bring down the house.  And people are going to do the whole sing-along.  And then have sex with it.  Yeah, probably.  We're hearing some things.  Jesus.  Calm down a little bit, will you?  Oh, she a naughty one, huh?  Oh, boy, is she?  We just heard some stories.  We're just hearing things.  I don't know if it's true.  We're just hearing things.  I'm hearing things. 
[01:42:00]  Maybe she wants to call and tell us.  Yeah, tell us.  Tell us what's true or false.  What's wrong, right?  Did you hear the promo that they did locally here in New York?  Yes, I did.  I was listening to it.  And before I knew what it was, all that was going through my head was, what is this?  It just doesn't sound like our audience.  No, it doesn't sound like our audience.  It doesn't sound like it belongs to our show.  And then I realized, oh, no, someone put this together, and it's not us.  Right.  Well, listen to this. 
[01:42:30]  We'll stop it.  But there's some major problems with the Mac promo.  Oh, it's a Mac promo.  Okay, so somebody...  Or Mac promo karaoke, yeah.  It's kind of like they've got some people together, some guys, some girls to hang in.  They're kind of 30-somethings.  They might be in a coffee shop.  I don't think it's Starbucks, actually.  Yeah.  It's got to be a little cooler and hipper than Starbucks, because Starbucks is so corporate, man.  It's corporate, man.  You know, maybe they're waiting to hear some poetry.  Oh. 
[01:43:00]  And they just happen to have a little conversation about our MacBook on.  Yeah.  Man.  They're going downtown to be a little hip.  This is not an eavesdrop style, like you're overhearing a good conversation.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yuck.  This gave me douche nails.  You'll love it.  It really did.  You'll love it, Jim.  I never hung...  I don't think I've ever hung out in this type of forum.  This crowd.  Listen to this.  Free FM.  I just had fries.  Yeah, whatever about your fries, dude.  Did you hear that Opie and Anthony are giving away the new Mac promo? 
[01:43:30]  Stop.  No.  Stop.  First of all, douchebag.  I just had fries.  What a bore.  Who said that in a conversation?  Hey, I just had fries.  Did you?  Drop dead.  But how would you be so...  Look, we love what we do.  We're hoping there's some excitement out there for half this crap we throw at you.  But for someone to interrupt a food conversation and go, whoa, screw your fries, man.  You hear about Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Enough about your fries.  But he didn't say that. 
[01:44:00]  He went, whatever with your fries, dude.  Dude.  What is that?  What do they say?  Improv and sound like guy in parentheses?  Whatever with your fries, comma, dude.  Do you hear that Opie and Anthony?  Stop trying to be a guy.  Just talk.  Whatever with your fries, dude.  Whatever with your fries, dude.  Well, because we're going for the white crowd.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Whatever with your fries, dude.  I should have ended.  There's a punch as the broad.  I want the same promo with a lot of punching and tasering going on. 
[01:44:30]  Slaps and gunfire.  Let's get back to the conversation.  Somewhere downtown, man.  Maybe at a wine bar.  Having some olives and cheese and a glass of wine.  And whatever about your fries, dude.  Did you hear that Opie and Anthony are giving away the new MacBook?  Oh, sweet.  Nice.  I'll win.  Do you just have to...  Right again, please.  Oh, wow.  Oh, sweet.  Always a broad.  Sweet.  Oh, sweet. 
[01:45:00]  Sweet.  Does anyone say that?  No, they don't.  I would have said that if someone smashed a MacBook across her face.  Sweet.  Yeah.  Oh, sweet.  Oh, sweet.  Oh.  I only want to hear her saying that if they say it has that taste and she's licking off  a woman's shoes on a plane after Oscar got through with her.  Good old Oscar.  Oscar rules.  You're not going to forget Oscar anytime soon. 
[01:45:30]  Whatever about your fries, dude.  Did you hear that Opie and Anthony are giving away the new MacBook?  Oh, sweet.  Nice.  How do I win?  You just have to sing a little karaoke.  Oh, dude.  Remember last weekend?  I'm the karaoke king.  I want to text you up, oh, yeah.  Don't look at me.  It's time because you don't stop, baby.  I love you.  Yeah.  We remember that.  You should never do that again in public.  Ever.  But I'm awesome.  No, you're not.  Are you a karaoke king or queen? 
[01:46:00]  I am a tag.  Then MacBook Karaoke with Opie and Anthony is all you.  Go to 92.3.  Put this together, Michael Dell.  Choose from a list of karaoke songs.  Record yourself, sing it along to it for about a minute, and send it back to us.  Opie and Anthony will choose five people to win the incredibly new MacBook.  Yeah, we will.  It's sexy, and you can create everything from music, movies, reading cards, podcasts, websites.  Don't worry.  They go back to the.  You can practice karaoke in the privacy of your own home. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, guys.  That's not funny.  Yeah.  Neither is your singing.  All details.  92.3.  Free effort.  Neither is anything to.  That would have been more accurate.  It's sweet.  If there's the Opie and Anthony and she would, I hate those guys.  They're pigs.  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Let's keep it accurate, will you?  They make fun of cancer and retarded people.  Why do you listen to that crap?  Yeah, exactly.  You defending this, Dan?  You're stepping up to a microphone.  Uh-oh.  No, I was just saying they said neither is your singing, but if it's bad, isn't it actually 
[01:47:00]  funny?  So they're wrong.  Right.  Exactly.  Of course they're wrong.  It's awful.  It's terribly written.  It's terribly acted.  It's terrible.  Everything about it is terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where did it come from?  Not me.  Not Steve.  Who?  No, it wasn't me.  Point fingers.  I swear it wasn't me.  Of course it wasn't him.  The woman didn't get abused in it.  Thank you, Dan.  She would have said, oh, sweet.  It was done in-house.  That's all.  And it's a bunch of staff voices on it, but I don't know specifically who did it. 
[01:47:30]  Look, they play their roles well, but it doesn't represent the show is what I'm getting  at.  Their acting stinks.  Is this the staff that acted that out?  Yes.  Why didn't Tom have a part?  Why didn't Tom have a part?  Now that would have been good.  All right.  Well, why are all the homosexuals walking over to our table and then he waves his tie at  someone?  MacBook karaoke.  His little fingers.  I'm like a...  Why would they want a MacBook?  I don't know, but as soon as somebody said MacBook, you know, Lisa Orban would start  rubbing their shoulders. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, thanks for the pension.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah, that's got to be dealt with, I think.  Hey, we started a theme very early this morning.  We were waking up all the sickos this morning.  The guy that's going to, like, you know, dismember a skull today.  A body.  Maybe chop off arms and legs and leave a torso in a park.  So one of the many themes that are running through the show today.  Not all the listeners are nice people. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, that's what we're acknowledging.  Yeah.  And this story comes in.  A fugitive suspected of killing and dismembering his own wife has been captured.  Stephen Grant was arrested in a rural area almost 300 miles from his home in suburban  Detroit.  Grant's wife, Tara Lynn, went missing almost a month ago.  Body parts, including a torso, found in and around the couple's home are believed to be  Tara Lynn's.  How about...  Grant is expected to be charged with murder.  Yeah, I heard what happened. 
[01:49:00]  He, honestly, he went to the park to bury the body parts and went back to his house.  Then the cops came and said, we're going to search the park because we got some information  that leads us to believe she might be in the park.  And he went back and dug up the torso, just the torso, and put it in his garage.  And the cops, that's where they found it. 
[01:49:30]  They found her torso in his garage.  And once again, it all started with a nice wedding.  Oh, I'm sure their wedding was beautiful.  It was a nice wedding song.  Everybody was there with their camcorders.  Do you think their wedding picture was there?  Both of them smiling faces, glancing down as he's just hacking her limbs off.  There's their wedding picture, smiling.  Pictures of the family.  Got the whole family together.  Maybe a picture with a sunset in the background. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Maybe it was an outdoor wedding.  Yeah, and he's just...  Just sawing through her bones.  Oh, is that fantastic?  I love thinking this crap about...  How does it go so wrong?  I love it.  They were so in love when they got married.  I'm sure she danced to, you know, Daddy's Little Girl.  Daddy's Little Girl is...  With Pop.  That's it.  Stupid DJs handing out the blow-up instruments. 
[01:50:30]  Come on, everybody.  What was his name?  I don't know.  No.  Who cares?  The brand new Mr. and Mrs., you know, and then they give the name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They come out under everybody's hands.  Oh, looking like rock stars.  Running through the tunnel.  Looking like rock stars that day.  Guy's wearing the sunglasses.  She's rocking.  And they're dancing and just...  Oh, it's a great day.  Oh, they all did the electric slide, but...  Oh, man. 
[01:51:00]  How does it go so wrong?  He fed her cake politely, and then she mushed it on his face, and he made a mental note.  That's where it started.  I thought they knew it was him.  They found, like, a little bit of wedding cake on her mouth.  You put cake on my face.  You bitch.  You're...  You're...  You're...  You're...  You're...  Yeah, it all starts with some nice...  You're the animal...  Nice wedding music.  You're the animal...  My part of gold...  Your daddy's... 
[01:51:30]  It's a very sad day for a daddy.  To heaven move.  It's while you move.  Good morning.  And shining stars. 
[01:52:00]  Your spirit of...  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Daddy remembers dancing with his little girl when she used to stand on his feet and dance.  Now he can still do that just with her feet.  Hey, this is some twisted stuff.  I understand it's not for everybody, but it all starts with the wedding.  Yeah.  And then goes horribly wrong somewhere in there.  And now here's where, like, the new groom, the husband, like, kind of cuts in on the father. 
[01:52:30]  Taps him on the shoulder.  That's a teary-eyed moment for everybody.  He's now handing her off to the new man in her life.  To a sicko.  That's going to love, honor, and cherish her.  Sickness, death, health, sickness and health, whatever.  And then just hacking away at her limbs, going, what happened?  He held her hair while he cut her head off and talked to her. 
[01:53:00]  Somebody shouldn't talk to her in the game.  Look what you did.  Razzle-dazzle.  Now we want to invite all the couples out on the dance floor.  Let's have all the loving couples join the happy couple.  Steven Brands.  All right.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, wait.  We've got to make it all better now.  I was only joking.  Oh, all right.  It's okay now.  Now it's fine.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We need something that's going to make this all better.  Penny party!  All right.  Makes everything better.  That's some sick stuff, but you've got to think, man. 
[01:54:00]  There was a time everybody was happy.  Yeah.  Then the old saw comes out from the wedding ring slipping on the wedding band in the church.  There was a point she's laying there on the tub or whatever with pieces missing, so he  has to take the hand and put it in a bag while she's lolling back like, this is the woman you  married, and there she is, but her hand is gone.  Now her leg is gone.  And there's blood everywhere.  I mean, you can't dismember somebody without blood going everywhere. 
[01:54:30]  Did they get annoyed at that point?  Like, I wish someone would have told me how much blood this would have been.  Yeah, like, Jesus.  This is the happy couple?  Oh, look.  Oh, man.  They look like any couple, man.  Yep.  Yep.  These two just open up your local paper, go to the wedding section, and there they are.  Her smile is awful, though.  Look at her smile.  Oh, you've got to cut that head off.  This is really the couple?  That makes it even creepier.  She has a stroke smile.  Yeah, she's like, eh.  Yeah, didn't she? 
[01:55:00]  It's like, she smiled, you could see her teeth, but then the right part of her mouth is kind  of dripping down like, eh, eh, eh.  Wow.  This guy's a sicko, huh?  Yeah, he just had it.  Look at him.  He looks like the kind of guy that would just, at some point, just had it.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Cute little story there.  Yeah.  I know I effed that one up.  Give me a break.  Hey, old, how do you dismember...  A skull.  A skull, yeah. 
[01:55:30]  You wouldn't smash it.  I know I'm messed that one up.  Give me a break.  We're working hard for you today.  We're really trying.  Don't make, don't make her be sad.  I'm sad now.  Cleanup would suck, though.  I'm really sad.  What do you use?  How do you get all that blood up?  I'm really sad.  Oh, what?  Oh, I'm happy now.  Everybody. 
[01:56:00]  Everybody.  That's terrible. 
[01:56:30]  I'm sorry.  Hey, after the break, Anthony found some really, really good FCC complaints about the Super  Bowl.  Yeah, apparently they're pouring in, and they're ridiculous.  Pouring in over Prince's performance.  Prince's performance, because he had his guitar behind that screen, so he was silhouetted, 
[01:57:00]  and it looked like he was manipulating some kind of phallic symbol.  But he was just playing the guitar.  But he's playing the guitar, and of course he was doing that, but guitarists do that all  the time.  Yeah.  And then the other FCC complaint that they got a lot of complaints about was the Snickers  commercial.  The gay Snickers commercial.  And this just goes to show you people don't know what the rules are.  They don't know.  They're just complaining.  They don't know that that's completely legit.  You can't get...  You're not going to get a legitimate reaction from the FCC about that commercial. 
[01:57:30]  It was well within standards.  You're allowed to show that.  Well, these complaints are really funny to read.  I'll tease it this way.  This is part of one of the complaints.  Thanks, CBS, for turning my son gay.  Oh, yeah.  There's some winners.  The rest of that complaint and others on the way.  That was from Mrs. Chiasano.  Oh, God.  Why are you obsessed with him today?  I love him.  This is ties.  Stupid Rangers beat my Islanders last night as Rick DiPietro was standing on his effing 
[01:58:00]  head.  Ah, whatever.  That was a little too local.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Welcome back.  It's the Opie and Anthony morning program, and we're broadcasting everywhere, including 
[01:58:30]  Pittsburgh.  Who cares that I'll be there this Thursday through Sunday?  It's not important.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  My improv day is irrelevant.  You're taking advantage.  I didn't.  Turned it into a plug.  I love when Opie chews.  Chew, chew, chew, chew.  On the instant feedback during the break, someone's like, why are you guys so obsessed  with serial killers?  Actually, they pointed me out.  It's not that I'm obsessed with serial killers.  Jimmy actually is.  Jimmy reads about serial killers all the time. 
[01:59:00]  He's one of the country's experts on serial killers.  Yes.  I'm not even kidding.  He knows stuff that is...  Foremost expert.  It's creepy how much he knows about serial killers.  So one day we're going to have to do that again, where you just mention somebody.  He's got all the details.  But I'm more obsessed with what's going on as you're committing this horrific act.  Yeah.  And we were talking during the break about Reservoir Dogs.  It's a perfect example.  Yeah, that great scene.  They really portray that perfectly.  Where the cop is getting his ear cut off. 
[01:59:30]  The music's playing.  Yeah, the music's playing.  Stuck in the middle.  Stuck in the middle with you.  Yeah.  And then there's a scene where Mr. White there goes outside and he opens the door and it's  just nice tweety birds you hear and children playing and it's a beautiful day, sunny, and  he goes to his trunk and grabs the gas can.  Yeah.  And the door of the place shuts, so now you can't hear the music or anything.  You're only hearing outside sounds and real pleasant outside sounds.  And you know a weather guy somewhere was giving that awesome forecast, like today's the day. 
[02:00:00]  And there's people going about their lives just yards away, having a good time, not realizing  there's just horror going on in this building.  A house of horror.  A house of horror.  It's those little details.  I'm more obsessed with that because you just read the story or you watch it on TV and you're  like, wow.  But there's weird little things going on.  Like, is the guy playing music?  Is there a FedEx guy just knocking at his door? 
[02:00:30]  That's what you want, the details.  He's got to just wait a minute or two until the guy leaves.  Is the TV on in the background?  Is it like some, like, I love New York is playing in the background as he's doing this  horrific thing?  Yeah.  Is there someone upstairs maybe just sleeping?  He figures he can get away with it, you know?  That's what goes on in their heads.  That's what I'm obsessed with.  All right, moving on.  Small details.  We've got a few other things we want to try to get to before we get out of here.  Ann Coulter, the John Edwards thing.  I love her.  I love her.  She used the word faggot and they're all outraged. 
[02:01:00]  She's completely unapologetic about it, too, which it's finally nice to see somebody who's  just not apologetic about saying something.  That's just, that may be a little inappropriate.  All right.  That's it.  Indirectly.  We don't have the, oh, we have the original clip?  All right.  Just keep, get everyone on board with this really fast.  Yeah, they were saying she called him a faggot.  Yeah.  And that isn't, that isn't quite true.  All right, really.  The way she said it.  She did listen to him.  Oh, and I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate, 
[02:01:30]  John Edwards.  Edwards, but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word faggot.  So, I'm, so, kind of at an impasse.  Can't really talk about Edwards.  So, I think I'll just conclude here and take your questions.  Thank you.  Oh, you guys think she's hot?  They always say, like, she's hot and stuff. 
[02:02:00]  I don't really see it.  I think she's sexy.  She kind of looks like a tranny.  Yeah, definitely tranny.  She looks like a tranny that has, you know, about much of the, there's some hormones going  on in there.  Yeah, she has a long, big, thick man neck, but she's sexy because she's probably a big  spirit.  They all say, like, how sexy she is.  I mean, I know she doesn't have much competition as far as that goes in politics, so I guess you  got to look at her that way.  But I don't see it, man.  The liberals hate her, too.  Oh, yeah.  Because she's just, she's a woman who's not, who's not towing the female company line 
[02:02:30]  that Democrats usually like to see.  She's just brutal.  She's, like, guy brutal.  Yeah.  Well, this is what Edwards had to say, which was just amazing, and this is why the guy should  not be president, by the way.  He doesn't even know the basics of our country.  Presidential hopeful John Edwards is firing back a conservative commentator and Coulter.  Coulter used a homosexual slur to refer to the Democratic candidate during a speech at  a conference of Republican strategists on Friday.  Yesterday, Edwards said that kind of hateful language should not be tolerated. 
[02:03:00]  Some Democrats have called on Republicans at the meeting to denounce Coulter's remark.  Get this.  Coulter responded to the criticism on her blog by writing, quote, I'm so ashamed, I can't  stop laughing.  Good for her.  Good for her.  Stupid John Edwards.  She is kind of sexy.  Look at her.  Well, you know what it is?  She's tall and thin, but she kind of looks like, yeah, a tranny a little bit.  I'll have to pull her hair and spank her.  Here's the latest on this whole controversy. 
[02:03:30]  I guess she was on, was the heavy hitter on last night?  It was Hannity and Combs.  Hannity and Combs.  Oh.  Was it Hannity and Combs?  Or was it just Combs?  Or was Hannity there?  I would think Hannity would be there for such a big story.  Were they both there or what?  Yeah, it was the both of them.  All right.  Combs is like, you know, he'll talk to a selectman somewhere, you know, and that's when they  just have Combs in there.  But whenever there's a big story, Hannity's got to be there.  By the way, I'll acknowledge that I stole that from Michael Moore. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think it was in a Michael Moore book.  No, it might have been in, I was reading all those political books for a while.  I would read one book and then I think I'm informed on the whole thing.  Al Franken.  I think it was Al Franken.  You're right, Than.  Al Franken, he was talking about Hannity and Combs and Hannity was in big block letters  and Combs was very tiny font.  Yeah.  Very tiny.  That made me laugh really hard because we've done that show and, man, it's, it's, I don't  know why it's not Hannity's show at this point. 
[02:04:30]  I really don't get it.  It's the Sean Hannity show.  It really is.  With Combs.  With Combs.  This is what happened last night.  Your answer is, okay, it was a joke.  Would you make a racial slur and just say it was a joke?  No, that's preposterous and I think it's offensive that, you know, you immediately,  whenever you have to go to the argument, oh, would you use the N-word?  I mean, that's, that is part of this, of this semantic totalitarianism to compare everything  to the N-word.  No, if you weren't brought here as slaves.  I didn't say the N-word, I said a racial slur.  You weren't legally discriminated against. 
[02:05:00]  You hear this when people say, you know, we can't use the word illegal alien because  that's like using the N-word.  No, those are words that are specifically used to demean a particular race.  The word I used has nothing to do with sexual preference.  It is a schoolyard taunt.  And unless you're going to announce here on national TV that John Edwards, married father  of many children, is gay, it clearly had nothing to do with that.  It's a schoolyard taunt.  Oh, bravo.  She's right, except for the fact that it has nothing to do with sexual preference. 
[02:05:30]  Yes, it does.  Don't, of course.  It's got a dual meaning is what it is.  It's got a double meaning.  Well, when you were using the word faggot growing up, I didn't even know what it, I  just, I didn't know the sexual part of that.  I really didn't.  No.  It was just one of those words you used to call your friend out.  It was when your friend was being a wuss.  Right.  Wasn't doing what you wanted to do, hang out, go out, go to the bar, take his car out,  whatever.  It's just like he was doing something, and you'd say, you know, don't be a faggot. 
[02:06:00]  It didn't mean anything gay when you use it like that.  Well, in the comparison, I mean, she meant it that way, which is fine.  She was joking.  She didn't mean like he's seriously gay and let's hurt him.  But she was saying faggot and the fact that he's kind of a wishy-washy, we knew what  she meant.  It's just, that's what you meant.  And it's fine.  That's what you should have meant.  I like that she went on the defensive like that, though, turned it right around.  Yeah, she was good.  Like comparing everything, like, yeah, any word you use now has to be compared to the  N word and has to have the same thing where you can't even say it anymore. 
[02:06:30]  You got to just use a letter.  She used some big words there.  It scared me.  Semantic totalitarianism was brilliant.  I was like, uh, yeah.  Well, it's like I always say, semantic totalitarianism.  I've said many times in passing conversation.  Indeed.  Indeed.  Let's say hi to Lori.  She wants to defend Eric and Kathy.  I'm sure she's calling from Chicago.  All right, Lori.  Hi, Lori.  How are you today? 
[02:07:00]  Hey, guys.  Dial it down a notch on Eric and Kathy.  Come on.  What's the problem?  Okay, what?  She's an idiot.  She's an idiot.  I'll give you that one.  Mm-hmm.  But.  Eric has got, you played two sentences that were moronic.  It's not a fair assessment.  Aw, we should dial it down a notch, guys.  We're going to dial it down a notch.  We're going to dial it down a notch for you, Lori.  We're going to keep an open mind with Eric and Kathy, and we're going to continue this  bit for the rest of the week, so we'll give you a few more clips. 
[02:07:30]  So you're saying Eric is a funny guy?  He's one of those guys.  Okay, a lot of it's milquetoast.  I'll give you that, you know.  But, you know, when I'm having my coffee, I don't care about, like, I go back and forth  between you guys and Eric and Kathy.  I'll admit it.  Yeah, that means you're a dirty girl.  That means Lori's a dirty girl.  She's saying she doesn't want to hear about certain things, right?  And when you're having your coffee, you don't want to hear about crazy things.  No, I just sometimes...  No, but I'm having my coffee.  You know...  I'm ready for it yet. 
[02:08:00]  Will you read the paper in the morning?  We might have been a little harsh today.  You're trying to have a little oatmeal and coffee.  We're talking about sawing off limbs.  That's the news.  Deal with it.  That's what makes us great.  Let's be honest.  What's another weird reason there, Lori?  As we dial it down a notch.  I like you.  Are you going to let me talk?  Yeah.  Dial it down a notch.  She's got a spunk.  Oh, you're going to take that?  You got a little moxie there, too, Lori.  All right, Lori, go ahead.  Go on.  Jewish girl, you bet, man. 
[02:08:30]  Let's hear.  You're a what girl?  Nice Jewish.  Okay.  Oh, what a shock.  A Jewish girl talking a lot.  All right, good.  Okay, I have won so much free crap from them.  It's a draw.  I've won trips to Cancun.  Oh, you're a prize pig.  We used to call them prize pigs.  You're a prize pig.  I am.  I'm a prize whore.  Give away some stuff and I'll listen to you guys.  I've worked for many radio stations and they actually list the prize pigs.  Yep.  You got the station on autodial and everything? 
[02:09:00]  You bet.  We would have a list.  It would say prize pigs and they would have their names and the aliases they use.  Yeah.  So when these prize pigs would call you, you would make up some excuse like even though  they were the 10th caller, you'd go, ah, you were the 8th caller.  They're working speed dial on three phones.  Yeah, so you could, you know, spread the wealth a little bit.  These prize pigs ruin it for everybody.  So what have you gotten?  Okay, I got a trip to Cancun.  And if I tell you the music I like, you'll totally diss me, so I'm not going to go there.  No, we have very eclectic tastes here. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God, don't diss me.  But okay, go ahead.  I can take it.  All right, what do you like?  They do these things where they have these small intimate gatherings with various musicians.  Uh-huh.  I won a little breakfast with Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora.  Oh.  He's one of my closest friends.  That's fine.  Did you get any?  That was pretty hot.  I mean, I'm a huge Jon Bon Jovi.  I love for him.  Are you?  That was cool.  You think he's cute, do you?  I do.  And I won a Goo Goo Dolls kind of Cancun thing where I actually saw Johnny Resnick. 
[02:10:00]  Say, she's a prize pig.  Yeah.  I saw Johnny Resnick in his underwear in the spa.  So worth the trip.  Wow.  Are you married, Lori?  No, I'm single.  Can you tell?  Yeah, you've got to be fat.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Opie.  That's not selling nice.  Oh, Opie, now.  Take it down a notch.  Are you a big gal?  Yeah.  What?  Are you a big gal?  You're among friends.  You can admit that you're fatty.  I'm about 5'2", 135.  Is that fat?  Yeah, you're pretty much a disgusting spectacle.  But I mean, as long as you're enjoying both shows, that really is all that matters. 
[02:10:30]  They're kind of stumpy.  So we've got to give away stuff.  That'll help.  All right.  Enough of the prize thing.  What do you find?  Give me one bit you like from Eric and Kathy.  I don't like Kathy.  Let's get that straight.  All right.  She hates Kathy.  She's in love with Eric.  Yeah.  You think he's cute?  No, and they hate each other really off the air.  That kind of makes it interesting, too.  You guys got it all wrong.  Yeah, but they're phonies because they don't bring any of that to the actual show.  No, they do.  That's why I'm saying that. 
[02:11:00]  If you listen to this show close enough, you'll hear when we're hating each other.  Trust me.  I listen every day.  I think I'm a better...  Yeah, but if they hate each other off the air, but they don't bring that to the actual show,  that's not fun to learn.  Has he ever called her the C word?  Yeah.  Because that would be honest.  Kathy.  No, he hasn't called her the C word.  I'll give you that one.  Okay.  See?  All right.  That's a good start.  Good place to start.  They talk about all that crap that you guys never talk about, which is what people want 
[02:11:30]  to talk...  You know, relationship, crap.  We talk about that all the time.  We're learning.  We're learning now.  Yeah, aren't we?  This is what we have to do to get big in Chicago.  Relationship stuff?  Yeah.  But not serious relationship stuff.  Oh.  You're making this hard now.  What?  They make fun of people.  They make fun of people?  Yes.  Somehow that didn't come out in what we heard.  They make fun of the guy that severed his lovely bride.  That's a great relationship story.  That's as relationship as you can get.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  I make fun of my ending relationship.  I mean, we all joke about our relationship.  So we talk about it.  You're wearing me down.  I just wanted to say a lot of it's crap, but Eric has got some zingers.  I have to admit, there's...  Holy crap.  We're doing well.  Thank God.  She's proving a point.  If one of our listeners called up and said, man, I love you guys because you got some  zingers.  You got some zingers and dial it down a notch.  And stuff.  The vocabulary you have, Laurie, is really...  I don't know. 
[02:12:30]  It's kind of like that soccer mom kind of thing.  Wait a minute, Ant.  Were you trying to learn?  I was trying to learn.  Hold on, Laurie.  Shut up for a second.  Big deal.  Anybody can do that.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Take it down a notch, Laurie.  Shut up.  Yeah.  Zingers are coming.  Go win a prize.  We got to go.  Wait for a zinger.  Yeah, go wait for a zinger somewhere.  Wait for the queue for you to call.  Zinger and a ring ding.  Were you trying to learn? 
[02:13:00]  I was trying to learn from her.  I know.  Learning is for queers.  Don't you forget it.  I screwed up.  Trying to learn.  We're heading over to XM.  Yeah, we want to do the Super Bowl complaints.  For tomorrow, I guess.  One of the complaints ends with,  thanks, CBS, for turning my son gay.  Boy, she really spelt out the Eric and Kathy fan. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Like that whole, the way she spoke.  Yeah.  The words she chooses.  The, it was just, you could picture her with her coffee.  Oh, that was a zinger.  There's a good one, Eric.  Oh.  Happy.  Yeah, just, just, just sponging prizes and buying nothing the advertisers were asking.  I won.  I'm going to Cancun.  And they cover up the phone or put her on hold and go,  Oh my God, this is the same bitch that won that thing with Bon Jovi. 
[02:14:00]  I could tell it's her voice.  Damn it.  We don't have time to play Donna Summer, do you?  Do we?  Ah, probably not.  Eric, tomorrow, Donna Summer.  Over here for the new people.  That's where we rag the prize pig really bad.  Yeah, we take care of the prize pigs out there.  We have a couple classic phone calls.  The Donna Summer's one is just great.  We'll play it over here tomorrow, though, because we got new listeners over here.  The other side of the show, they're like, not that old gag again.  Hey, guys, thanks.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the Opian Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you.  This one's got the best sound on it and everything, as far as the videos go.  Very dramatic, great build, and then you get us with our horse shit.  Here we are with our dick jokes after that fucking intro.  Yeah.  We're not.  We spent a lifetime learning his craft and all those musicians just, since they were kids  learning the instrument, to put together what is a beautiful piece of art.  Yeah.  And here it comes.  Say cunt.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  We're not too pompous, are we, huh? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, the assholes.  I've fallen back in love with YouTube for the music stuff, and you know what I can't stop  watching?  There's a version of Elvis singing Sweet Caroline.  Really?  And he does...  No, that's not me from the Ron and Fez Night of Fights.  You wouldn't do the Elvis dance.  Elvis does the Sweet Caroline dance, and it just rules.  Really?  He does the Sweet Caroline dance?  He does something with his hands.  Do it, Jimmy.  You got to do it.  I don't remember it, but it's like that, and it's one of the worst dances ever, and yet  it's perfect.  You were just dancing. 
[02:19:30]  It's almost like the Watusi.  What are you doing?  Like, your head went the opposite way of your arm?  It's one quick move.  Oh, oh.  No, he does it on the ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, like, sweet.  Sweet Caroline.  Bum, bum, bum.  I can't remember it.  Is it like, bum, bum, bum?  No, it's like one or two quick ones, and he just does it.  But his head is so...  We're dancing in here.  It's fucking Elvis on radio.  It's good.  Quality radio.  Big buildup, and then you can hear people dancing.  Hear our feet tapping. 
[02:20:00]  And with that, we say hi to Keith Robinson.  Keith, what's happening, man?  I like this song.  I love it.  You like the ecstasy of God?  I love it.  I'm going to ride through the neighborhood, right through the hood with the windows down, sunroof.  With a nice crown on with the music just blasting.  Yeah, that'll fit.  Yeah, that's one of the...  I can't see that song really taking off with the brothers.  I love it.  Everybody will pay attention.  They have to turn that stuff down and listen to me.  That is like an important song.  It is.  It's like an announcement that somebody big is coming through. 
[02:20:30]  Shut the fuck up.  I'll just ride through the neighborhood slowly.  This is important.  Something important's happening if this music's playing.  That's why I love it.  I love it.  It's like a week of months.  This is so important.  It's almost like the one they play in Apocalypse Now.  The ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.  Even if you don't like classical, you've got to know somebody's on their way when that's  being played.  Is it Ride of the Valkyries?  Which one is that?  Yes.  Yes.  Very good.  It is important.  Hey, I want to hear Sweet Caroline by Elvis now.  I love his version.  I know that he goes... 
[02:21:00]  Sweet Caroline.  Very beautiful song recorded by Neil Diamond.  I thought he says Neil Diamond.  All right, let's hear this.  Oh, my God.  Why is Banana Phone playing?  Oh, that doesn't sound like Elvis.  Oh, he's a phone.  Hello?  It's not about ratings.  Shut up.  Who's this?  It's not about good ratings.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Citibank.  I don't know my job.  You fucking asshole.  Hang up, cunt face.  Shut up, you fucking bank piece of shit.  We know what you are.  I'm after 11 o'clock. 
[02:21:30]  All Jews.  Jews.  After 11.  Shitty bank is for faggots.  I got the TV on.  Yeah.  Sperm bank.  How about that?  Swallow your receipts.  By the way...  Your fucking robbery.  It's all robbery.  Your fucking fees on your machines.  By the way, look at my accounts.  I get paid to do this.  All right.  I'll...  I'll hang up already.  Fuck you.  Just want to help you for all its words.  I'll talk to you later. 
[02:22:00]  Take your money.  The fucking money lender.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, they are.  It's a bank.  That's the fuck.  Ah, that's...  That old gag.  There's a sight that you're here, Keith.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That'll change in a couple of minutes.  Flight of the Valkyries.  Right.  All right.  Sweet Caroline by Elvis.  It's not flight.  It's ride.  Yes.  Yeah, it wouldn't be flight.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  That song makes me nervous.  I feel like I should be doing something. 
[02:22:30]  Keith brought up a great point on the way in.  It's so fucking cold outside that people are just cursing to themselves.  They are.  We're on the elevator, and there's people you don't know on the elevator, and you walk  in because you're just out of the cold, and you're just standing there going, fuck.  Shit.  Fuck.  It's fucking shit.  And that's how people are bonding, actually.  Like, fuck.  They look at each other.  Yeah.  You walk into a building out of a cold spot, and you just look at each other and go, fuck.  You'll kind of point at the door and go, shit. 
[02:23:00]  But people know what you mean.  Like, someone will go, fuck, and you go, I know, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, shit.  Fuck, shit.  It's ridiculous out there.  It's awful.  I said it was Everest cold out, and Jimmy had to tell me, you know, it's 100 mile an hour  winds up there, and the temperatures are a lot colder.  So, Jimmy, let me know it was a little colder on Everest than it is outside of New York  right now.  Well, and then here's what I said, which really, I should be fucking just cracked across my open  mouth. 
[02:23:30]  I said, that's the cruising altitude of an airplane.  Just the fact that I said airplane, that's like a five-year-old speak.  Fuck it.  What else could be cruising at that?  An airplane for up there.  What else cruises at that altitude?  Faggots in spacesuits?  Whoa.  Watch that F word.  Oh, yeah, right.  You're up on the F word, right?  The new F word, because the old F word doesn't matter anymore.  The old F word used to be fuck.  We should be calling it the new F word.  Just be an initial.  That word, yeah.  Yeah, you'll just be able to have an acronym for people. 
[02:24:00]  He's just an effing F.  Are you a fan of banning the N word there, Keith?  No.  Nigger needs to be said.  Nigger can be said.  It can always be said.  Nigger can be said.  Faggot should be allowed all the time.  Someone said it best on our show.  I would love to give them credit, but they're like, look, you can use the word all you want,  but there's a consequence for using it, and I agree with that.  Well, I mean, it is a consequence, but, Nick, you can say, everybody in here should be able  to say, nigga.  I should be able to say. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, we do.  I know you do.  With the mics all and all.  You're sitting in my car.  I wouldn't like it if it would be when the mics are off, but you guys just let it sail.  Look, there are consequences.  When I saw you in the elevator with us, something came on.  I didn't know I was coming by today.  Do you love Ann Coulter?  I love her.  Yeah.  I love that she's not taking any shit about it.  And she won't apologize.  Yeah.  You have to love Ann Coulter.  Good.  I love her.  She's still goofing on her.  Don't you?  She is.  Whatever. 
[02:25:00]  I said it.  Go fuck yourself.  A big man neck.  You do have to love her fucking ignorance.  Big Adam Zapp will go, gulp.  Am I in trouble?  Gulp.  Half a man.  Oh, and everybody's trying to distance themselves from her, and she's just still going, I love  it.  She don't care.  It's great.  But, yeah, I think that whatever you want to use, and some people go, it's un-American.  That word should be banned.  And it's like, you just put those two statements together, banning words and un-American? 
[02:25:30]  Right, right.  Fucking constitution.  It's the amendment they figured to make the first.  It was the most important one.  Let's make it number fucking one.  And then they talk about banning words because they're offensive.  There's no right that says you have the right to not be offended.  Well, I don't, you know, the thing to me, I want to see, it's like, they should have  like words, the top words, like the top faggot is coming up.  It's almost a-  Faggot coming up the charts.  Yes, coming up the charts. 
[02:26:00]  Nigger's still coming in as number one.  Nigger's still holding his top slot, but faggot is on its way.  Faggot's on its way up the charts.  A few more big people use that word.  We need one more person.  One more big person to say faggot.  And honky hasn't been on the charts in 20 years.  It's been a long time since the Jeffersons.  Yeah, exactly.  Honky, honky.  No matter how hard you try, you can say it as hard as you want.  You honkies are getting on my nerves.  They'll just laugh.  Ah, you guys.  I got to be honest, we've always laughed at honky.  It's just silly.  And it's never been used in a bad way, except maybe in an old Clint Eastwood movie. 
[02:26:30]  But it's always been like a funny kind of term to use on the Jeffersons, like you said.  But even Archie Bunker never said nigger.  You know, I mean, that was always kind of like, meh.  I think Archie Bunker even said the n-word back then.  Even he was politically correct.  Yeah.  I don't think.  But now by saying the n-word, you're saying the word.  So now they're going to have to ban saying n-word.  N-word.  After that.  We said they're just going to have to go, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.  And they're trying to ban the word mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. 
[02:27:00]  Because the n-word is now just as bad as the word because you're just replacing it.  I want a few more attacks on faggot word.  I want to hear faggot more.  That's what I want to hear.  That'll bring it back up.  I want it up the way it's supposed to be.  Faggot number two.  Faggot is timeless, man.  I love that word.  We're talking about it like it's fucking Dark Side of the Moon.  It's just great.  It's always going to be on the chart.  It's just there.  It's a classic.  It rolls off your tongue just right.  Yeah.  Give it a whirl.  Faggot. 
[02:27:30]  Faggot.  Faggot.  It is.  It's funny.  Happy.  Are you, faggot?  Get out of here.  Faggot.  It works in every way possible.  Every way.  Happy.  Angry.  Yeah.  You tell it.  You can say it to your friends knowing they're not gay.  You just go, stop.  Don't be a faggot.  Get your keys.  We're fucking going out.  You know what?  In the neighborhood, we can use both words in the same sentence.  You faggot-ass niggas are getting on my nerves.  Look at that.  Beautiful.  And it means no hate speech there whatsoever.  Nothing hateful about it.  You love the person you're saying it to. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  But you could be sad saying that thing, too.  You could be going, what's the matter?  My son's a faggot.  And he's seeing a nigger.  And he's seeing a nigger.  Oh, wow.  Is that the only two words that are offensive that people like that?  No, no, no.  Squaw.  Squaw.  Squaw is working its way up now, but I don't think it's got popular support.  Indians do not like the word squaw.  That's like an R&B song.  It's not popular.  I know.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  It's kind of laying low.  It's not a crossover hit yet.  It's a category that no one cares about.  But the Indians have been successful with getting teams to change their names.  Sports teams to change their names.  The Redskins could have the Redskins.  Well, the Redskins still.  But I mean, a few more.  Like the Redmen.  The Redmen changed their names.  Red Storm.  Yeah.  The Kansas City Chiefs, like I said, you know, nope.  We're not changing.  No.  Like pro sports.  But yeah, enough money.  I agree with the Indians, though, on this one.  I'm not the Squaw.  How do you agree with the Indians?  Why?  Because they're the only group that's allowed to be kind of – I heard them explaining it 
[02:29:00]  one time on a talk show, and they were just like, look, they're cartooning us.  And if you do that with another group – I mean, they're fighting Irish.  The Irish just don't care.  But Indians kind of have a history in this country of, you know, mass slaughter and genocide.  It's – you know, I can kind of – I get their point on it.  Redskins was a term used to pile up Indian bodies.  That was what – that was a pile of redskins.  That was how that term came into effect.  I thought it was just their redskins.  No.  It was like –  No.  There's always some horrible story to it.  I know.  You know where the word –  I keep playing history.  Like, Hoffie Pot came from. 
[02:29:30]  What the fuck happened?  I really am a fucking mood killer for Super Bowl.  Oh, shit, dude.  The real history behind the Indians.  Shut you.  What the fuck?  I just wanted to do my tomahawk chop.  You know what, Jim?  There's no history behind the word nigger.  No, that's nothing.  Yeah.  There's no team called that either.  All right.  Let's start one.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You know the history of the Indians.  They were really treated bad.  Nigger is great.  But when they start saying, look, the Jersey niggers lost by eight points tonight, then you'll 
[02:30:00]  be correct.  You can't name a team after black people.  But how great would that be if one of the NBA teams decided to change their name?  Oh, my God.  Well, with all the hip-hop artists and bond basketball teams, you may get it.  Yeah.  Like the swag, wearing the shirts, the team logo.  Just make it N-I-G-G-A-S.  The Brooklyn niggers.  Yeah.  With a Z at the end.  Yeah.  You'll be all right.  That would be nice.  By the way, we're having fun, but I've got to just acknowledge something.  Opie.  I went to chew this pen.  Don Rickles?  Oh, I thought you were going to go, we all love each other here. 
[02:30:30]  We're having a lot of fun with these words, people.  Hockey puck.  I just went to chew this pen, and it's a pre-chewed pen that someone else chewed because  I did not recognize my own chewing.  It's probably you.  No.  Oh, you recognize, what, do you leave a fucking mark on there that you can identify?  You know when you're, yeah.  You're just CSI.  You know your own chew.  You know the bite pattern?  I want to puke.  Why?  Just because maybe someone else had it behind it.  You ever smell somebody's, like...  Oh, smell this.  No, I will not.  Smell it.  Under no circumstance. 
[02:31:00]  Why?  Intern.  Why?  Get an intern in here.  Scum.  Yes.  All right.  Just get a...  Intern's going to be a word that they...  The I word.  It's just going to be the I word.  I like this kid.  This is Jeremy from Atlanta.  Let's see if we can get in this.  He's a go-getter.  He's a good boy.  Oh, by the way, someone's reminding us.  You know, we're not going to do the obvious and play sparkling wiggles for Keith today,  but the definition of the N word, Louis C.K. explained it perfectly. 
[02:31:30]  Do we have that?  Oh, I wish we had that.  We'll start in a few minutes.  Yeah, I know.  Someone can get it.  Yeah, go find that.  A white guy gave you the definition of...  No, Louis.  Louis Mexican.  Oh, right.  It was the origin of the word.  The guy called origin.  Louis Mexican convenience.  Yeah, I wouldn't...  You're right.  He's Mexican when he needs a federal grant.  Do you hear...  That's the best definition for the word, by the way, coming up.  It's actually the origin of the word.  The origin.  Yeah.  Yes.  Our own black girl works on the Ron and Fez show.  He fancies himself part Cherokee Indian. 
[02:32:00]  Jeez.  And I just read in the paper that the Cherokee Indians are throwing out all the blacks, saying  that they're not Cherokee anymore, because the way they got to be Cherokee was they were  actually slaves owned by the Indians.  And the Cherokee Nation decided that they could become Cherokees.  But the Indians own slaves, too?  Yes.  The Indians own slaves.  I didn't know that.  And they could then become Cherokee Indians.  And now recently, like right...  The day after Black History Month, Cherokees got out of a little beating, a little powwow, 
[02:32:30]  and decided, get the blacks out.  Beat it.  We don't want them anymore.  Beat it.  So they're not entitled to any of the privileges that the Indians...  Yeah.  No casinos for you.  No casinos.  You ever go to the casinos in Mohegan?  I never see an Indian.  That black guy.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of black guys.  Black guys for the projects.  They're running the joint.  I run this shit.  I'm Indian.  Fucking Apache, asshole.  What's your next question?  Shut up.  Double down on that.  I need some money. 
[02:33:00]  Joe from Illinois.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  How's it going?  How do you do, Joe?  What up, Joe?  Yeah, I was called to tell you, they just took away the Illini's Chief Illini wig.  The what?  Yeah, they took away our mascot.  The Illini's University of Illinois basketball team, man.  Oh, yeah?  Good.  Yeah, they just took away their mascot.  Oh, fucking...  Fuck the mascot.  No, what's next?  Who's next?  Exactly.  Keep a lot away.  There you go.  There you go.  Fuck you.  We've been enjoying the mascots all these years. 
[02:33:30]  You enjoy the mascots.  No, I know.  I hate them.  Where's him next to Philly Phanatic?  You gotta stop it.  What was the Braves mascot?  Every time a homer was hit, he would kind of jump up.  Chief Nakahoma?  Oh, exactly.  Or is he from the other...  I don't know.  I want him back.  How about this?  All right, how about this?  Let's get it...  For the WNBA, how about Team Lippy?  And the fucking mascot is a woman with a fucking zipped up mouth and a black eye.  How about that?  Team Lippy.  Lippy.  Team Lippy.  Team Dinner with Lacey.  You mean Team Licky? 
[02:34:00]  No, Lippy.  Or fucking being punched in the mouth by our husband.  Yeah, well.  I want our mascots back.  But if you...  I don't.  You say the Philly Phanatic and stuff, they're gonna say that it's goofing on retards.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  Because it acts retarded.  Who's next?  You can't get rid of the mascots.  But it's not...  Save the mascots.  Mr. Matt, I can see being a Down Syndrome parody.  Big fucking waterhead.  Mr. Matt, big baseball-headed goof.  But Chief Waka-Hoo and all that shit, man.  Waka-Hoo.  I don't blame... 
[02:34:30]  They're just trying to have a little fun, Jimmy.  And what?  Now no fucking reruns of F Troop?  Because of the fucking Hakawi Indians?  You don't remove...  They went, where the Hakawi?  Are you dating an Indian woman who...  No, I wish I was because they had big pussies.  Do they?  The kid's like a papoose.  They carry their young in it.  Hey, you want the origin of the word?  Yeah.  Give me the...  All right.  From Louis C.K.  Where a nigger came from?  Originally?  There was some black guy being a nigger.  So they called him a nigger. 
[02:35:00]  Isn't it good for y'all, man?  He's a punk nigger.  And that's where it started.  And this was a...  Nigger was a feeling.  Yeah.  He's just like, this...  It wasn't just...  Yeah, it wasn't some wordplay.  Just blurting out a sound that it came out like that.  Just the guy was being such a nigger.  That it fucking made someone say the word.  Fucking God.  Hey, Patrice is helping it along, too, there.  Jesus Christ.  He wasn't disagreeing, man.  He was being so serious, though, because we had just found out the definition of what word? 
[02:35:30]  Kike.  Of kike.  Kike.  Yeah.  Of course, the Jewish slur.  And so Louis goes, you know what the definition or the origin of the word nigger is?  And we were, like, looking at him all like, what?  Like, wow, we want to know.  And he comes out with that.  And we're like, you fucking asshole.  I was buying this.  Is this hell here?  The origin.  Origen.  Origen.  Yeah, I'd like a spelling bee.  Origen, please.  What's the matter, Opie? 
[02:36:00]  Sweetie.  This is the healthier version of the parfait.  I like a parfait.  But it's healthy.  Yeah.  If you don't like it, I'll get you the...  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  The bottom part of that looks like the shoes of a sexually abused airline passenger.  Oh, thanks.  What is that?  Yeah, as I drink a smoothie.  Oh, he's got a little bleeding of the testicles.  Yeah, Chief Nakahoma was the bravest mascot.  Chief Nakahoma.  Nakahoma.  See, it sounds like an Indian, but it's Nakahome run. 
[02:36:30]  Like, hit a...  You get it, Jimmy?  Fucking awful.  Why?  You remember, they had...  What was the wrestler?  Chief J. Strongbow.  Yes.  Yeah.  All of...  You know, what about the wrestlers that have these names?  That's not...  You know.  The Iron Sheik.  Yeah, the Iron Sheik.  It's a total fucking stereotype of a...  He wore the curly fucking old shoes they haven't worn in centuries.  He was horrific.  That guy was great.  Down with America.  Fucking guys.  Wrestlers are slightly different in that they all parody different. 
[02:37:00]  Every ethnicity kind of gets it.  But then again, you're right.  What's the mascot doing?  You don't see a Jew.  You don't see a Jew wrestler.  Here he is.  You know.  I'm in the bank.  You know.  It's a naughty Jew with a big nose.  I'm going to out-wrestle you.  And all he does is send his lawyer out to sue the wrestler once he hits him.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  That'd be a great gimmick.  Where's Vince?  Oh, he's got his lawyer talking for me.  He's got to pay us and stuff.  He's shadow boxing.  Yeah, he's like shadow boxing, but never actually goes in the ring and does anything. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  His lawyer just serves papers to everyone in the ring.  Well, you know what?  That's what it...  I think the Jewish folk never really get it like that.  Never.  Why?  Because we're scared of that.  You know what happened?  Because everyone's scared of that.  Well, because they run the media.  They have been through so much oppression and slavery.  Oh, wait a minute.  What are you talking to?  Well, Brando got in trouble because he was being interviewed and he goes, you know, Hollywood  has never cartooned or parodied the kike. 
[02:38:00]  He said they have...  Wow, he actually said it like that?  Yes, he did.  But he wasn't saying that to be racist.  What he was saying is that they've done like the Dago, the...  He said they've done every race with blaxploitation movies or mafia movies, have taken the  stereotype of an Italian as a guinea.  It's a mafia guinea.  That's a stereotype of an Italian.  So he said they've never shown the kike like that, which is the parody of the Jew.  They just don't show you that in Hollywood.  Well, it was done in another country between the mid-30s to mid-40s.  A lot of cartoons, a lot of posters were put up parodying the Jewish person. 
[02:38:30]  Where?  Berlin.  Berlin.  Poland.  France.  You want me to expand?  In Iraq right now.  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to Bruce in Memphis.  Bruce!  Yeah, it's Rooster, not Bruce.  All right, Rooster.  What's up, Rooster?  Hey, with Bruce.  You know...  Rooster.  Normally, I absolutely love Jimmy, but I can't believe what a fucking hypocrite he's being.  Not being a hypocrite, dude.  First of all, why am I being a hypocrite?  Because you have defended people's right to talk about everybody. 
[02:39:00]  I am part Cherokee.  Dude.  And I think that the Cherokee Nation needs to rise up and have a little thicker skin about their names.  Let me say, I agree.  Talking about anybody is different than cartooning them.  And I'm not politically correct, but they are the only group that you're allowed to do that to.  It bugs them.  And I think that they're right to be irritated by it.  Because if you did it with blacks, like, I think you should be able to talk about everybody.  But you can't cartoon everybody in a mascot, can you? 
[02:39:30]  You can't do it with blacks.  You can't do it with Jews.  You can't do it in any other group where it's acceptable.  But we've proven the Indians are weak, so it doesn't matter.  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me.  Why don't we just have them running around with an anthrax blanket on?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, we were the first terrorists.  Let's talk about that.  Isn't that kind of...  Isn't it kind of cool, though?  Like, they're not naming a fucking, you know, weak piece of shit thing after an Indian.  They're naming, like, a fucking football team, man.  The Chiefs, like, you know...  Yeah, Kansas City Chiefs.  Yeah, it's like you want a name that shows energy and courage and bravery. 
[02:40:00]  That's why they picked the name.  The Tomahawk Chop.  It's not the Kansas City Chief faggots.  Right.  It's like the fucking, you know...  It's like a...  I think it's kind of showing that they're powerful and kind of, you know...  Yeah, I said that when they're three and thirteen.  And fucking it's halftime.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I will give it to you that fans are idiots, and the mascots do have to look a little goofy.  They just run out.  I like the Tomahawk Chop.  But although they're...  Although I believe... 
[02:40:30]  I believe the Redmen's mascot, wasn't that just a guy dressed like an Indian?  Mm-hmm.  Like, legitimately, with the headdress and the makeup and stuff like that?  He was a warrior, eh?  A warrior.  Like, it wasn't like the goofy, big-headed, fucking, you know, Mardi Gras float-head Indian.  How terrific.  How terrific.  Chief Nakahoma can fuck his mother.  Chief Nakahoma stinks.  He's a fucking clit.  Fucking hate Chief Nakahoma.  Hey, the man Nakahoma, didn't he? 
[02:41:00]  Fuck you.  You hate Chief Nakahoma.  You really do.  I would love them to say that he's HIV positive.  All right, all right.  Chief waste away.  Can you please call up with other mascots?  Holy shit.  Because we hit Jimmy's button today.  I wish I could remember some more of these mascots.  I think a mascot touched him when he was a baby.  That's what happened.  He got the red skin.  He's Nakahoma grabbed his fucking cock. 
[02:41:30]  Nakahoma.  It was his first baseball game.  Yeah, yeah.  He went to the bathroom by himself.  Hey there, son.  You need a little help?  Put his tomahawk on your ball sack.  I'm Chief Nakahoma.  Yeah, come here.  Oh, please call up with other mascots.  Please.  We just don't have that knowledge right now.  Yeah, you got the Cleveland Indians.  You know, they like naming their teams. 
[02:42:00]  I know.  You know what?  Again, it's legal, but it should just be enough already.  Get over it.  Fucking change the name of your shit dick team.  What, are people not going to root for the Redskins?  People fucking root for the...  When the fucking Colts moved and came back as the Ravens, they root us for them.  What the fuck?  What about the Cowboys?  Well, the Cowboys had the...  He had a black...  It was a black guy who was dressed as a cowboy.  Yes.  And I think he came to Philadelphia and they beat the shit out of him.  Of course they did.  Oh, they beat him.  It's like, what the fuck?  He had a cowboy shooting his gun. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, the black guy?  Loud, loud.  Wait, why did they pick a black guy to be a cowboy in Dallas?  The mascot is a Nick.  What's that?  A Nick.  I said the mascot is a Nick.  Yeah, I never thought about that before.  A black cowboy in Dallas is a little strange.  Well, yeah, he came out.  We've been to Dallas a few times.  I'm surprised that flow.  And that's through the years.  He's been there a long time.  Yeah, I understand, actually.  He got beat up in Philly?  Yeah, I think he was beaten.  He was beaten pretty good in Philadelphia. 
[02:43:00]  Philly is the worst.  Philly brothers are rough, man.  In between Santa Claus getting pegged with batteries.  You should fucking travel with a construction worker, a biker, and an Indian.  Philadelphia has the worst white guys you ever want to see.  It's got to be the worst white guys.  It is.  It's just awful.  What about the guys with the Philly beards?  They're like...  No, the long beards?  Yeah.  That's the...  Their problem.  No, no.  There's problems there, too.  The Philly white guys are the worst.  They're big.  They're thick-necked. 
[02:43:30]  These thick-necked white boys are the worst.  The Boston white guys are...  They're number two.  Number two?  Yes.  The Philly white guys are number one.  But at least in Boston, you know where you can go and where you can't go kind of a thing.  Right.  You know, you're not going to go fucking into Salty and just bust into a bar and go, hey,  niggas, what's up?  You know?  Well, you know...  Like, Philly, though...  I'm at the game, the Philadelphia Eagles game.  I'm a Cowboy fan.  And there's a guy walking through with just a Georgetown hat. 
[02:44:00]  They started booing him and throwing beer on him.  He's like, this is Georgetown.  It's a basketball team.  We don't give a fuck.  Get out of here.  Animals.  They are animals.  You've got to love them.  Jesus Christ.  We love Philly.  Let's go to...  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's go to William in Miami.  William, what's up?  Hello, guys.  Hello, Bill.  What's up?  Well, I was going to say, I'm part Seminole, and I'm down here in Florida, and a lot of  it has to do with pride.  We're actually proud to have these teams have our heritage as their symbols.  It's nothing slanderous or offensive. 
[02:44:30]  No, you're not.  Hey, let's...  Oh, really?  We are.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Let's figure out...  Chief Nakahomo from Atlanta.  I hate him.  Bye again!  Well, how about the fucking...  How about the mascot for the Indians?  It's Chief Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's his name.  Chief Wahoo.  And it's that big, round face.  Yeah.  Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's good culture.  Chief Wahoo.  All right.  Before we get off the air today, we've got to figure out the worst mascot. 
[02:45:00]  Because someone...  Good old Freddy.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  I forgot about this.  And I think we were up there when they debuted this.  The Red Sox mascot is awful.  What is it?  Oh, that thing is stupid.  The green monster.  The green monster.  And his name is...  I forgot now.  Where are you?  Should be a shot pregnant one.  Wally.  Shot pregnant one.  Wally?  Wally.  He couldn't find a...  Guess what a name alone he should be fired.  Wally.  That is no thought process.  The green monster.  The green monster.  I remember when they debuted him, the whole place just started booing. 
[02:45:30]  Like, what are you doing to our city?  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the new Boston Red Sox mascot.  It's Wally, the green monster.  And you just heard, boo!  Go fuck yourself, you cock sucker!  Who the fuck is Wally?  Wally's a queer now.  You fucking queer!  You fucking queer, Wally!  Go fuck Wally, your mother, your fucking mother!  Hey, Sully, Wally's a queer!  Sully, I'm going to lob this fucking bottle at the fucking monster's head. 
[02:46:00]  You watch?  And I should have.  That's no thought process behind it.  No.  And Jim from Philly...  A wall.  Jim from Philly writes,  Opie, we didn't throw batteries at Santa.  We threw snowballs at Santa.  We threw batteries at J.D. Drew.  J.D. Drew.  That's right.  Who's that?  Baseball player.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a baseball player for us.  And let's not forget the standing ovation after what's-his-name was paralyzed.  Michael Irvin.  Michael Irvin.  Oh, shit.  Fucking brutal, man.  That's what gives Philly its fabric, its texture.  Yeah.  You just love to hear stuff like that from cities. 
[02:46:30]  Just mean people.  God damn.  Why don't you love that?  You have to love it.  I'm from Philly.  I've suffered all racism, all his race riots, and I still love it.  I just love Philly.  They're out of their fucking minds.  All right, let's go to...  They certainly are.  Adam's going to piss off little Jimmy today.  Adam in Virginia.  Go ahead.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a couple of them for you.  First off, the Atlanta Braves have Tommy Hawk and Homer D. Brave. 
[02:47:00]  Homer D. Brave.  How about the other one?  Maybe it could be a white guy and a mustache, husband of de-communist cunt.  How about fucking Ted Turner throwing that one in there?  And then the other one is the University of Georgia Bulldogs.  They have hairy dog.  Hairy dog.  Oh, like hairy, hairy dog.  Maybe you can have like an ultimate fighting mascot competition, have the last mascot standing. 
[02:47:30]  Just a bloody mascot, just bashing.  You can give them weapons.  You know, Wahoo have his little...  Tomahawk.  Yeah, they have that what they're equipped with.  With a Philly fanatic and like tongue people to death with that stupid fucking party favorite tongue.  He sticks out.  Oh, dude, I want to smack him.  When he came into the studio when we were at YSP.  Oh, he smelled.  He smelled bad.  And he smelled dope.  They've got to figure out how to watch those mascot fucking uniforms.  And he's inside it.  You don't see...  You just see the dopey face of the fanatic. 
[02:48:00]  And we're like, oh, fuck, that stinks.  And he's like, look, guy, I don't get to fucking wash this thing.  That's funny.  You don't have a way to wash these mascot outfits.  Look at the Philly fanatic.  He turned around.  No, that's the green monster.  Let me see.  Ew.  It looks like fucking Mayor Menino with a green head.  Big, fat fucking head.  That's what the mascot should have been.  A big, oversized tongue in a mayor's mouth.  Mascots fucking suck.  They don't help anything.  No, they don't fucking get anybody riled.  Oh, the mascot's getting us to cheer.  Look, he's standing on the dugout. 
[02:48:30]  No one fucking listens to them.  The mascot is fucking passe.  When guys wear fucking suits to baseball games, that's what a mascot was appropriate.  They're shit.  Look at the mascot, dear.  How about another lucky strike?  I really fucking hate them.  Because they're not cute and they're not fun.  They don't do anything.  They're fucking embarrassing.  Look, a Negro's up to bat.  It's me, which, let's go to something you don't see.  Derek in Jersey.  Look at his fucking, he has a fucking tampon nose.  The Philly fanatic.  You know what he has? 
[02:49:00]  It's a fuck sleeve.  His nose is a bookstore fuck sleeve.  Hey, fuck sleeve nose.  I hate the Philly fanatic.  Why do you hate the Philly fanatic?  Because you can hold his...  It looks bad.  It looks like a toilet paper.  You could fuck his nose.  A big hole in his nose.  Yeah.  The 76ers had Big Shot.  I think they got rid of him.  That was his name, Big Shot.  Big Shot.  Yeah, but they booed him.  Hey, let's go to Derek in Jersey.  Derek, try to jump in here, Derek.  Good morning, fellas.  That's what Philly fanatic's nose.  You know what that's used? 
[02:49:30]  For jacking off.  Go ahead, Derek.  He used that for jacking off.  All right, fellas.  The Philadelphia Phillies were the last National League baseball team to sign a black player  10 years after Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson was quoted as saying he considered Philadelphia a city from the deep south.  Oh, shit.  Even beating out Boston?  I told you, Philly really is the worst.  I love it.  It's the worst.  One other thing about Philly, they're the only city ever to drop a satchel charge from 
[02:50:00]  a helicopter on human housing to get the residents out.  It was called the Move.  The Move, yeah.  When Move was squatting in buildings, it was an organization called Move, and they were squatting  in these buildings, and they tried to get them out.  How much they tried, I don't quite remember.  It was like this.  Hey, guys, you want to leave now?  All right.  Bomb them.  Yeah, and they dropped a satchel charge from a helicopter, and it was just supposed to... 
[02:50:30]  What a good incendiary device.  It was just supposed to, like, make a loud explosion and kind of tell them, get the fuck  out.  But they dropped an incendiary device on the roof and burnt the whole fucking block down,  and it killed a bunch of people and injured a bunch, and kids were running out, and it  was a mess.  That's Philadelphia.  John Wildwood.  The Philadelphia 76ers have a mascot called Hip Hop, voted the worst mascot, and when Barry  Barnes came to Philly, the fans threw prescription medicine bottles at him. 
[02:51:00]  That's smart to throw.  Somebody with your name on it.  Here's my name, address.  What's wrong with me?  What I'm taking.  There's some of the illegal shit that I'm taking.  Someone's pissed off.  That guy's full of shit.  The Red Sox were the last team to sign a black guy, and they could have been the first.  That makes more sense.  The Red Sox.  The Red Sox and others tried out at Fenway before Jackie broke in and somebody yelled,  get those ends off the field. 
[02:51:30]  Those ends.  Someone.  Fucking Boston, man.  Phones are lit.  We'll talk about mascots and some other things.  I got to take a leak, man.  Ooh.  What happened?  A little leaky.  What happened?  Pumpsy Green.  Can you tell me?  Pumpsy Green.  We got some info here.  What there?  It's taking a little while to download here, but the blurb I saw was Pumpsy Green was the  last first black baseball player.  I want to know the first black mascot. 
[02:52:00]  That's what I want to know.  Who was the first sports black mascot?  Who has that one?  Who has that?  I'm sure it's some team that doesn't exist anymore.  Some awful racist name.  Down south.  I'm the Negro League.  All right.  Pirates mascot is Oliver Onion.  Is that true?  Travis has something.  It's a big pair of balls and it's sweaty. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Another Braves mascot that was around the same time as Chief Nakahoma was his counterpart  Princess Winnalata.  Wow.  Stop it.  I swear.  Winnalata.  Fuck him.  What corn balls?  Oh.  What the fuck?  Who's enjoying that?  They just didn't care.  That just shows you they didn't care about that.  They just showed the mascots what they really were.  And now Princess Winnalata.  That's my favorite part when she comes out.  She gets you all riled up.  I love how Philly's helping us along here instead of like going, come on guys. 
[02:53:00]  It's not that bad down here.  They're like, no.  They want to defend how awful it is.  Matt and Philly.  Remember, Philly has a holding cell in a courtroom in their football stadium.  Courtroom.  They do that, man.  That's great.  Trials are being held down and people are being executed.  Oh, it's brutal.  It's always a good fist fight.  Someone's rolled out getting a lethal injection.  I'm doing something in the stands.  That's great. 
[02:53:30]  We got lots to do, man.  Keith Robinson in-house.  How are you working this weekend, sweetie?  Yeah, are you working, Keith?  Yeah, man.  I'm working tomorrow night, actually, in Providence, Rhode Island.  The casino, Catch a Rising Star.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's the little shows there.  Are you a gambler?  Yes.  Blackjack, baby.  All right, we'll talk about that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Steve S.O.S., I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Milk Diva World Tour.  World Tour. 
[02:54:00]  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Oh, the app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  And you could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  A special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk? 
[02:54:30]  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around, so I'm like, eh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie wants milk.  He only takes it from CBS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing that, how desperate I am right now?  You're getting condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed. 
[02:55:00]  Thank you, Dynamite.  Thank you.  Just got your instant feedback.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dynamite, from Brockton, Matt.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Derek, very, very, very angry with old Jimmy Norton. 
[02:55:30]  Too bad.  What's up, Derek?  It's Eric in New York.  Hi, Eric.  I said that already.  Jimmy, I love you, man, but you were a little rough on that girl with the breast cancer and  Poughkeepsie.  Oh, he's kidding.  No, I wasn't.  I was actually very nice to her.  I was awful to her friend, but I was actually very nice to her.  Well, my grandmother has had breast cancer, and I haven't been able to get over it.  Why?  Who, are you going to titty fuck now?  I love you, Jimmy. 
[02:56:00]  Great to know you killed, man.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I was nice to her.  That's why I knew he wasn't.  Thank you.  All right.  I was hoping we had a hater.  Hey, how can anyone hate me?  I'm too popular.  We're looking at mascots.  Got to pass this one around the room to everybody.  The Reds mascot.  His name is Gapper.  Gapper?  Pass that around.  Gapper.  Gaper.  Or Gaper.  Right.  Sure.  Make your own jokes.  Jesus.  Gapper.  Let's see. 
[02:56:30]  Screw day.  Screw day from the Bengals.  Oh, yeah.  Pat Patriot.  Pat Patriot.  Oh, that awful big head.  Yeah.  Those stupid big heads.  And look, he's like going after, what is that?  The Eagles mascot?  Listen here, brother.  Yeah.  When they taunt each other and do that thing where they wave their finger at each other.  Hey, you.  Our team's going to win.  Yeah, because a styrofoam fist could do a lot of damage. 
[02:57:00]  That's only to your styrofoam jaw.  That's only cute if it's a styrofoam fist and it's a styrofoam pussy.  And you're speaking in German and threatening her.  Well, we got Sourdough Sam.  What is Sourdough Sam?  They're coming in like crazy.  It's like a prospector, an oldie time prospector.  What team is that?  And then my, well, this could be right up there.  The Colts, of course, have Blue.  He needed the money.  Oh!  Blue? 
[02:57:30]  And what is Blue?  A horse?  A fucking cow?  Oh, I've had it.  It's like kid cartoons.  It's like something like Barney.  It's stupid.  It's just for kids.  It's just for adults.  Ah, what's that?  What was that?  Your phone ding-donged.  And it's who?  He's still in there.  I'll let you know.  Uh-oh.  What the hell does that mean?  Serial killer? 
[02:58:00]  Someone chained up in your basement?  The Zodiac is back.  Yeah.  It's a bug.  What the F does that mean?  I think I love getting cryptic messages.  I only got one text.  I think this was supposed to be to Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  What does this mean?  What does it say?  He's still in there.  I'll let you know when he leaves.  He's still in there.  I'll let you know when he leaves.  Maybe someone's in the bathroom.  Ah, could be. 
[02:58:30]  No clue.  When robbing your house?  He's still in there.  He's still in there.  I'll let you know when he leaves.  I'll let you know when he leaves.  Is it the guy from Cheaters?  Oh, that guy's the greatest.  The one from Cheaters.  Fucking love those guys.  By the way, it is Texting Tuesday here on the Opian Anthony Show where we just text during  the program.  Well, I mean, that's cryptic enough.  I got to know what the hell's going on.  Yeah.  The Colorado Rockies have dinger, which is a word for a home run. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  A purple triceratops-like figure.  Aw, a little dinosaur.  Why?  Hey, Colorado, this fucking mascot should be in a trench coat.  How perfect would that be?  Fucking a trench coat with a shotgun and one glove, tap dancing.  Or a guy holding a garret in a little cowboy hat.  One little patent leather buckled shoe.  Oh, no.  A little cowboy hat. 
[02:59:30]  I love the little cowboy hat.  A few blonde hairs in it.  No, it's fixed.  What does this one say?  This might clear it all up.  Stop reading, stupid.  Stop reading, stupid.  Readings for queers.  My lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely girlfriend.  She's telling you to stop reading, stupid.  Yeah, she knows I don't.  Reading, stupid.  And learning's for queers.  We agree. 
[03:00:00]  What the hell does that mean, though?  I don't know.  Wait, was it something we were talking about?  He's still in there.  I'll let you know when he leaves.  Hmm.  What the hell is that?  It's not me.  I just heard a phone.  It's my phone.  Hey, getting a communique from Mike at fmqb.com.  Talking about mascots.  No, just mascots.  There was Bonnie Brewer.  Let's not forget Bonnie Brewer.  Bonnie Brewer.  The Milwaukee Brewers.  They had her sweep the bases during the seventh inning with a brewer.  I like that.  That's good.  She's a big Tanya toilet.  She's a little toilet scrubbing in the outfield. 
[03:00:30]  And then you got Bernie Brewer.  Milwaukee Brewers.  Used to slide into a big beer mug,  but they eliminated the beer mug when they built a new stadium.  Wait, he would slide into a big beer mug?  Oh, how fucking lame.  Hey, he was just trying to get a little head.  Oh, there you go.  Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.  All right.  All right, you're known for beer.  Syracuse Orangemen.  Now just the Orange. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  It used to be the Orangemen.  Now they're just called the Orange.  Why?  What were Orangemen?  Orangemen were Indians.  They were Redskins.  I never heard Orangemen.  I'm going to explain.  All right.  Orangemen was a tribute to a Dutch aristocrat  that halted the spread of Catholicism in Europe.  Of course, now we get Otto the Orange as the mascot.  Otto the Orange?  What?  So what happened?  Like, what was offensive about Orangemen?  Yeah, I'd like to know that, too.  I don't know.  Jesus.  I can picture it if you do it, Kim. 
[03:01:30]  You got to do it.  Oh, was in the spring, and spring became the summer.  I don't remember it.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  You got to go to YouTube.  Sweet Caroline Elvis Presley.  See you later.  Touching hands. 
[03:02:00]  Reaching out.  I got it.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Oh, sweet Caroline.  Oh, oh, oh.  The time's never seemed so good.  Oh, oh, oh, I've been inclined.  Oh, oh, oh.  Believe they never would and know. 
[03:02:30]  Look at the night.  Stop it.  And it don't seem so lonely.  We fill it up with only two.  They show really good, really good.  Look at the dance.  It's not a dance.  And when I hurt.  It's not a dance.  It's a move.  Burden runs off my shoulder.  He's geared the arm up.  Hugging I hurt.  He's gearing the arm up.  He does.  He gives the arm a spin.  Oh, that's terrific.  And then he throws it out.  Touching wall.  Come on.  Gear it up. 
[03:03:00]  There you go.  Reaching.  He's got to take the last moving.  He's tired.  Touching me.  You're all fucking fucked up on that.  I'm a knife at night.  Dr. the cop was waving at him from the fucking side of the stage.  Good time ever seemed so good.  Come on.  Yeah, that's great.  There he goes.  There you go.  That's the fucking coolest dance ever.  I would do that all day.  I would do that all day.  He does a really good thing.  Wow.  He just did some bowling moves.  Where the arm swings up to the right.  But he starts to circle the arm a little bit before he does the move. 
[03:03:30]  He's warming up.  I think he's being held up by strings.  Marionette.  And they're getting tired.  Give him a hand move.  He was the greatest.  There's nobody cool.  There's a great version of him singing Always On My Mind, too.  But he's got the thick glasses.  Priscilla just dumped them.  Oh, he's fucking miserable.  All's great.  Doped up.  He's got the fucking mutton chops.  I only like fucking Fat Elvis clips.  Watch him singing Unchained Melody.  It's fucking one of the greatest things ever. 
[03:04:00]  He sings an Unchained Melody version.  Big Fat Elvis.  You like that Elvis better?  Yeah.  Because he's kind of smiling.  He's really a charming guy.  I think it was one of the last shows.  All right.  Hey.  Groundbreaking, by the way.  Elvis was cool.  I'm really glad I mentioned that in 2007.  Fucking.  I'm 40 years off.  We've had a theme all day long, and we continue with the theme.  Another horrific marriage gone bad.  Ooh.  Goody.  All coming in today, these stories, by the way.  Good.  What would possibly motivate a 39-year-old mother, Hung Sung Lee, to take her three sleeping 
[03:04:30]  children, ages 2, 7, and 9, move them into the same bed with her sleeping husband, then  douse all four of them with lighter fluid, and then try to set them on fire?  Jesus.  How heavy do you want to?  We're supposed to answer that?  What would motivate her to do that?  What would motivate her to do that?  Wow.  That seemed to be the question.  She was going to smoke a cigarette?  She was cold?  What our response is going to be?  She heard the voice of God.  Ah.  That's most women's crazy play that God told her. 
[03:05:00]  Gotta put the kids in the bed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the...  Did you hear about the guy who flew the airplane into his mother-in-law's house?  I like how they said that.  Yeah, he had his daughter in the plane, and they crashed into his mother-in-law's house,  and they say, they're looking into whether this might not be an accident or not.  It's like, what are the odds you're going to be flying with your fucking daughter,  and crash into your mother-in-law's house?  Oh, my goodness.  It's on purpose.  I've had my share of crazy women, you know. 
[03:05:30]  I've had...  I've told Jim, an incident with my son's mom.  Now, what happened...  We don't live together no more.  She lives in Philly.  I live in New Jersey, Woodbridge, or whatever.  She came to my house.  She made copies of keys to my apartment.  Came in, bashed up my HD TV.  HD, 42-inch.  Oh, it was beautiful.  Smashed it.  And you know, with HD, you watch everything on it, you know.  She smashed it up, took my computer, put it in a tub of water. 
[03:06:00]  She thought about this.  Oh, my goodness.  She bashed up my Ms. Pac-Man.  Mini.  I got a Ms. Pac-Man mini arcade game.  She bashed it up.  And the thing about, before she did it, she played it first and beat my high score.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I went in and got a bunch of my stuff out beforehand, like my computer and stuff.  Oh, you have a crazy woman?  It was a divorce.  Yeah, I was married for like nine years.  Wow.  Oh, believe me, the listeners know.  They hear my misery usually. 
[03:06:30]  But I went in and grabbed everything.  Trust me.  But the stuff I left, and I left some stuff, you know, kind of some radio awards that Opie  and I had won over the years, you know, irreplaceable, things like that.  She had a big fire in the fireplace one night and just burnt everything.  Pictures.  My fucking clothes went into the fucking, like, goodwill.  All I know is I was driving around Huntington once and saw some homeless guy in a WAAF jacket. 
[03:07:00]  But you got to realize, though, when you look at it, it's your fault.  Dude.  We don't look.  I'm going to tell you why.  But wait, let me, because you just can't pass that over.  Like, the money this guy is paying now, it's like, fucking, at the very least, give him his fucking stuff back.  No, no, no.  And she knew back then at that point that, you know, she had fucking paid her.  Yeah.  A woman just don't turn crazy.  We see the signs and we ignore them.  So before we just brush over them, like my son's mind, we've been together for a long time. 
[03:07:30]  But I've seen the signs, but I've ignored them.  I saw the signs before I said I do, and I still fucking did it.  Yeah, you still did it.  Because once you mess with a crazy woman, there's no way to get rid of them.  You can't just yell at a crazy woman and say, stop being crazy.  They're going to be crazy continuously.  You're going to be crazy.  Yeah, they're just going to be crazy.  Only thing to stop them is a kick in the twat.  That'll do it.  Like Dracula has one, uh, a steak in the fire, a steak in the mirror, a kick in the twat.  Garlic is the only thing to stop a crazy woman. 
[03:08:00]  I've never had a physical confrontation with a woman I've dated.  I've never had, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, like a physical thing with a girl I've dated.  Because most of them are prostitutes.  They just keep their money and leave.  Yeah, I suppose so.  I've never dated anyone after more than an hour and a half.  Jimmy's got a girlfriend now.  Oh.  I've had a girlfriend.  That's right, that's right, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right, here's the rest of the story.  So she, uh, drags the kids and...  She's taken, ladies.  Uh, drags, uh, the kids into bed with her husband and now she's going to light everybody on fire. 
[03:08:30]  What made her do this?  Let's try to find out.  Got them on fire.  No idea.  No motive.  Mr. Lee was inside the family's townhouse where the attempted murder took place.  He wouldn't answer the door.  Earlier, at the entrance of this gated community, over the speakerphone, he told me what happened  is his business and nobody else's.  Well, it might be the police department's business.  They're still alive?  Yeah.  She didn't get it done.  She couldn't get the job done?  Oh, right.  She walked up and asked him for a match.  You'll have a match?  I need a writer.  Not only that, it gets more interesting. 
[03:09:00]  The husband, uh, starts helping out the wife here.  Last night, he told our reporter Susie Saw that he didn't want to go on camera or talk  about it.  According to the evidence, Mrs. Lee had a lighter in one hand, the kind that's very long that  she used to light a barbecue, and a piece of paper rolled up like a torch in her other  hand.  She actually lit the paper and was about to throw it onto her sleeping family when her  husband suddenly woke up.  There's a struggle in the bedroom, and the lighter's broken.  Somehow the fire's extinguished, and he's able to subdue her, and then we arrived. 
[03:09:30]  Does he?  And he calls 911.  Exactly.  On the call, which police will not release, the husband says only that his wife tried  to kill herself.  Nothing about trying to light the entire family on fire.  When police arrived, they pieced it together.  Lighter fluid on all members of the family, all in the same bedroom, the broken lighter,  and the burnt piece of paper.  This guy's got to cut his losses.  What is he doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Are you crazy?  Wow.  Crazy woman.  Cut your fucking losses.  Let it go.  Very dishonorable. 
[03:10:00]  Let them take her away.  I want to hear the 911 call.  Oh, I know.  Why?  She go crazy.  That's not my wife.  That's not my wife.  Invasion of the body snatchers.  I sound like a fucking flock of birds.  Randy needs an address.  What email address do we send a news story to?  I'm assuming it's for Story of the Month nominees.  Would that be to Steve?  Actually, news stories and dick pictures all go to steve at foundrymusic.com. 
[03:10:30]  That's right.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That address should be up on opiananthony.com.  Also, send them to danny at foundrymusic.com.  Dick, uncut.  Send them to Danny mostly.  Harry Potter type cock pictures.  That's right.  With preferably the mouth of another gentleman in the vicinity.  Foundrymusic.com.  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Dick pictures to Elo.  Here's the rest of the story.  When police and detectives arrived on the scene yesterday morning,  Mrs. Lee was still in the house, 
[03:11:00]  and there was no sign whatsoever that she had doused herself with lighter fluid.  No evidence whatsoever that she intended to kill herself.  Again, she'll be arraigned tomorrow on four counts of attempted murder.  Just a fucking...  How do you not beat her to death as the husband?  Maybe that's what he wants to do.  He's probably done, but it's the kids.  He's worried about the kids, and he's not going to do anything to her.  I've never seen...  But see, Asians, you don't see them on police.  Yeah, they're very private.  Very private people.  You never see Asians on Maury Povich pretending to take.  No, no.  Nothing. 
[03:11:30]  Yelling about everything.  You're right, you know?  Holy shit.  You don't.  They don't like spreading their shit around.  They take care of it in their own little community and their own house.  Like, he probably will just beat the fuck out of her.  That's why he's like, I'll handle it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry.  I don't care.  Dude, she tried to light you and the family on fire.  Yeah, we got something for that.  Like, they probably have some fucking scroll.  What you do when your wife tries to light you and the fucking husband on fire.  And you just got to beat the shit out of her and bind her feet. 
[03:12:00]  With the Chinese torture.  With the water disdrop.  Yeah, Chinese water torture.  Start with Chinese water torture.  Bind her feet.  They use duck sauce now.  We're pre-cum.  Let's go to Shwuggy.  Shwuggy.  Hey, boys.  What's up, Shwuggy?  Story of the...  Possible story of the month.  Okay.  Two sixth graders having sex in class in front of everybody.  Wow.  We got that story yet?  Go to Drudge on the left-hand side. 
[03:12:30]  Good old Drudge.  I think this is just hot, really.  Just because it's on Drudge doesn't mean it's true.  Drudge gets...  No, no, no.  It's been confirmed by the school district.  Channel 13 investigates school district.  Sixth graders had sex in class.  Sixth graders, not six-year-olds.  Did you say sixth graders?  Sixth graders.  Oh, you did.  All right.  For months, it's been a well-kept secret, but now Warren Township schools confirm a disturbing  case of sex in the classroom.  Thirteen investigates was tipped off by a disturbed resident who writes,  During school hours in a classroom with an experienced teacher present, two sixth graders 
[03:13:00]  completed the act of intercourse.  At least ten students were witnesses.  What?  No disciplinary actions were taken against the teacher.  All teachers were told to keep quiet.  What the fuck is going on here?  Did the teacher allow this to happen?  What a good teacher.  Warren Township Associate Superintendent Jeff Swenson confirmed it's true.  It's been kept under wraps since November.  How do you keep that?  Two kids were fucking while the teacher watched.  Keep it under your hat.  And ten kids are watching, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  But what was the teacher doing while she was watching?  Jerking off.  They're saying middle school students having sex in a busy classroom while a teacher is  present is true.  Two students were involved in inappropriate conduct in a lab class last semester.  We have investigated the matter.  Oh, it was a lab.  And taken appropriate action.  The school corporation considers the matter closed and we'll have no further comment.  Oh, the teacher didn't know what was going on.  No, the teacher didn't know what was going on.  They caught it and broke it up.  The what?  The teacher caught them and broke it up.  How does that, like, how does the teacher not know it's happening? 
[03:14:00]  It's in a lab.  How do you start fucking in...  Probably behind...  I'm guessing it was behind...  Behind one of those things that...  Yeah, labs are built kind of weird.  ...that the Bunsen burner's on.  What does she think?  They're working on frogs?  Are you reading the story from Drudge directly?  Uh, no.  If you read the story directly from Drudge, it goes into detail that the kids were on the lookout.  Yeah, there's a lookout that was helping the...  Meh, meh, see?  I'm on the lookout.  She's at the cops.  A lookout.  A lookout in class.  Meh, meh. 
[03:14:30]  I don't know if it's story of the month, but it's definitely a good one.  Yeah, it's just one to jerk off to.  I mean, it's hot.  Sixth race.  All right, thank you.  What a goer she is.  He's always good for one day.  All right, very good.  Are we done with the fire thing?  Oh, I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What's the matter, Ope?  He can't get the disc out of the player.  Well, why don't we get fucking E-Rocker Than here now?  Hey, we had something we were going to do once we got here.  What was that?  I'm trying to remember. 
[03:15:00]  The FCC thing.  Yeah, that was it.  No, that was for tomorrow.  Yeah, that was it.  Shit.  You promised him.  What?  Tomorrow.  We have other stuff we could do.  Oh, I know what we're going to do.  Oh.  I know what we're going to do.  We have better stuff.  What?  What?  Fuck each other in the butt.  Jeez.  Don't let the teacher see.  This is a lookout.  That sucks to be the lookout.  You don't even get to watch the fucking.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we had a teacher in seventh grade.  We, uh, boy, I hate to even say I may get arrested.  I don't know the statute of limitations.  So we sexually assaulted a girl, Kim. 
[03:15:30]  You're all right.  Jesus.  In seventh grade.  Wow.  We had to close off.  Right.  Everything happened.  We actually went through the petition through the other side to another class.  We was, uh, just honest girl.  Kim, the whole class was suspended.  But the girl, the teacher, yeah, that's it.  That's all you get back then.  That's a suspension.  Wow.  You guys gang raped her and just got a suspension?  I don't like to use the word rape, Jim.  You guys gang tickled her?  I was trying to say the R word.  That's the thing about Keith. 
[03:16:00]  People don't understand.  He really is a piece of shit.  Keith is a ghoul.  He comes off as nice because he's like, he has a good sense of humor and he's laughing.  But he is a piece of shit.  Wow.  And we went through it.  It was just, it was brutal.  But she was laughing.  As long as she was laughing, it wasn't really.  Oh, she was laughing?  She was laughing so hard she was crying.  Yeah.  Yeah, with some tears.  But then we thought it would be.  Holy crap.  Yeah, it was.  How many guys?  It was like about ten. 
[03:16:30]  Ten?  Did they all get the. . .  Well, we were just ripping stuff and grabbing and all sort of stuff happening.  Did anyone like stick it in or. . .  I think I did.  Oh, okay.  No.  You stick it in?  Just in case.  A little, maybe a little.  It's actually a little intense.  It was like seven years or whatever like that.  It's not 30.  What grade were you in?  Seventh grade?  Seventh grade.  35 years ago.  What?  Oh, I was going to say if you was in seventh grade, then I was 19 years old. 
[03:17:00]  It was fun back then.  That was a joke, Jimmy.  I think in New York there is no statute of limitations on race.  Maybe now there's not because of DNA, but that's been changed.  Yeah.  We'll let it go.  You leave any DNA behind?  No.  Nah, you're fucking kidding.  Any evidence?  Don't even worry about it.  Did she go to the police or the hospital?  No, she just went home and, you know, a girl named Kim.  Back then it was different.  They just wiped their pussy off and finished their homework.  Women were tougher back then.  Oh, my God.  Let's save Keith some jail time.  Holy shit.  I'm joking, man. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  They actually were.  I was only joking.  Let's save Keith some jail time and move on to Batwing Ball Bag.  Oh, well, if Batwing Ball Bag is calling, we have to move on.  Obviously an attorney.  Can I have some Lysol?  Jimmy's ass is leaking.  Jimmy, why today?  You know what it was?  I had the ice cream the other day.  Yeah, my sour stomach is better, but I guess there's still a little residual sourness on  the wall.  Ice cream is true.  Just give it a throw.  It's an emergency.  Ice cream after chili.  Mmm. 
[03:18:00]  These are like lactose farts.  Oh, you know what?  I can't even handle this one.  I'm sorry.  I'm usually pretty good.  This is a bad one.  I got nervous.  Holy crap, Jimmy.  I got a CSI, the fucking Vicks under your nose.  It smells like a baby's diaper.  I had a sour stomach.  A baby's diaper.  That's what he was eating.  I had a baby's diaper.  It smells like a...  Don't make fun of me.  A cloud of goodness in front of me now.  It'll make me self-conscious in what will come out.  Because you know what happens when I get scared.  You get scared and you...  You gotta push out courage.  Courage comes in and pushes the fear out of my body. 
[03:18:30]  Ah, Batwing Ball Bag.  Hi, guys.  Hello, Dr. Ray.  Hi.  The group of guys that we used to hang out with in high school.  In ninth grade, we used to see who could have sex in the high school and not get caught.  That's a great game to play, man.  And one guy would have sex.  He had sex in, like, the auditorium when nobody was around.  Or you'd have sex in an empty classroom.  And one of the top things was to have sex. 
[03:19:00]  It kind of sounds like the Sex for Sam thing.  But we had...  My girlfriend and I, she wore a skirt.  We planned it out.  She wore a skirt.  No underwear.  I had a pair of shorts on.  Just kind of pulled my...  Oh, you guys...  No, come on.  Go ahead, go ahead.  That means we're trying to help you along.  Let's go.  I don't get to see what you were wearing.  Pulled my jammy out.  We were sitting in the cafeteria during lunch.  She was straddled over me. 
[03:19:30]  And we had sex in a group full of people.  You know, we had our group around.  And nobody really paid any attention.  And just tried to pump it out and get it finished.  So, having sex in front of a group of people.  Jeez, how did that...  Dude, then what happened?  Nothing.  Well, no.  I mean, after, like, having sex in front of a cafeteria filled with other students,  something had happened.  So, what happened next?  Obviously, we weren't naked and we were being kind of discreet.  Other than the fact that she was, you know, sitting on my lap. 
[03:20:00]  Nobody else really knew what was going around or going on.  You know, she wasn't naked.  And she just kind of hiked her.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  And the group was around you.  Okay.  So, then what happened?  Nobody really saw that we were naked.  No, no.  But what happened after you had sex?  I finished.  We high-fived everybody that was sitting there.  And it was a good laugh.  But I thought you said some people...  Most people didn't notice.  But, obviously, some people did.  So, what happened?  Well, like I said, the group that was sitting at the table knew what we were doing. 
[03:20:30]  So, we got through it.  We all laughed at the fact that we actually accomplished it, didn't get caught.  Yeah.  After that, all that, though, then what happened?  I punched out and ended my story.  No, something had a...  What?  No, no.  There's always that one where...  No, well, that was...  No, that was it.  Oh, we had one on the line yesterday.  This is a wooden style. 
[03:21:00]  You're going to ruin it.  Nah.  Shut up.  There's always a sucker.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I know, Phil Hendrick did a show.  Not a little Fox 5 exclusive.  A woman freaked out looking at the fish she bought Monday night.  Check this out, and you'll see why.  You can look like your pussy.  She says, once she cut open the fish she bought at a Manhattan grocery store, she found worms.  Big worms.  Still moving.  I saw them just kind of curled up, and then they started uncurling and moving, making their  way in and around the fish. 
[03:21:30]  I naturally screamed, called my mother in Florida, and yelled, and said, what do I do now?  Yeah.  Step out of your tongue, cunt.  Holy shit.  What do I do now?  Mommy, what do I do?  I see one.  Oh, no.  Call a lawyer.  Call a lawyer.  You could probably sue.  Call the TV station.  I don't know.  I called my mother in Florida.  What the fuck is she going to do?  Who is she, Quint?  Does she fucking know everything about fish, you dumb cunt? 
[03:22:00]  Take a breath, honey.  Take a breath first.  You get bad food from a grocery store, you just throw it out and get taken out of something.  Throw it away.  Buy new fish.  You sure told me, get free food.  That's what you do.  There you go.  You know how fresh that fish must have been?  The fucking worm they caught it with was still alive.  That's a brand new fish.  You eat it.  Yeah, you just pick the worms out and eat it.  Well, you open your vagina and put the worms in and then show your friends the trick you learned.  Well, you do a Kegel tightening and the worms blubber out and then you all laugh. 
[03:22:30]  You look at a bunch of badly smelling worms.  You all laugh.  Bobby, there's fish with worms in it.  What do I do?  Shut up, bitch.  By the way, Josh from Jersey, high-fiving is for major fucking queers.  Yes, no one cool high-fives.  They were all high-fiving after it was done.  Yeah, it turns out the worms are parasites from the ocean.  The supermarket where Amanda bought the fish says the processing plant usually weeds out fish like this.  The problem is that word usually that gets me.  Anyhow, in a problem, I gave her her money back. 
[03:23:00]  Health officials say the fish would be safe to eat if fully cooked.  A little extra protein, apparently.  All right.  Like cum in your mouth.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the news.  It usually gets me.  Whose phone is ringing?  I'm very popular.  All right.  You are.  That's Hollywood calling.  Is it?  Mm-hmm.  Got a motion picture for you.  Jimmy Norton doesn't get that picture.  It'll make him a big star. 
[03:23:30]  Let's say hi to Roger in Massachusetts.  Roger?  Yo.  Welcome aboard, Rog.  What's up, Rog?  I ate the one long-time listener.  I met you guys out at the Holyoke Mall.  I remember that.  Yeah.  You were the guy that was there with the...  The CD.  What were you wearing?  That jacket?  Use my cell phone to try to get a friend of mine and do a fake-off.  The cell phone and then, yeah, we did a fake-off thing.  Oh, shit.  I remember that.  It was a fake-off, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember you.  The reason I called, you got to talk about sex stories.  I had rotator cuff surgery when I was 17 in the hospital. 
[03:24:00]  Shut up.  Girlfriend came in, had the nurse come in, give me my last meds.  I heard you.  Shut up.  What?  Me?  No.  No, no, no.  No, yeah, like, we fucking could say that to a listener.  Like a long-time listener.  What's your story?  Oh, man, you go back to the early days.  You go back to the time when we were dinosaurs.  No, we were listening.  You had rotator cuff surgery, and then...  Yeah, and my girl came in.  You know, I had the nurse come in, give me my last medicine.  The guy next to me was down to surgery.  No one gives a shit.  No one gives a shit.  He had a skirt on, came in, arms in a plane. 
[03:24:30]  No one.  I pulled the board and rode it like a fucking hog.  No one cares.  No one cares.  No one fucking cares.  Well, I thought you guys might want to...  No, Roger, he's not talking about you.  We're watching TV.  This whole Dick Cheney and the blood claw on his leg.  No one gives a shit about that.  Sorry about that.  All right.  So you're in the hospital, rotator cuff surgery, and then the broad comes in?  Yeah.  And I had a skirt on.  I pulled the curtain around, made sure the nurse wouldn't be in for a couple minutes, 
[03:25:00]  popped the board.  Keep going.  Go to like a champ.  Keep going like someone fucking gives a flying fuck.  Got it done.  Just keep going like someone cares what you're fucking saying.  Holy shit.  Bore.  Dude, some people do care about the Anna Nicole Smith shit.  Fucking ass.  No, no, no.  Yeah, they do.  It's still a hot story.  No, no, no.  That's all I got, though, for you guys.  No, Roger, Ann was distracted.  He's watching that Anna Nicole Smith crap.  So was this your girlfriend at the time or a nurse? 
[03:25:30]  No, it was my girlfriend at the time.  Oh, God.  It just doesn't shut up.  The mother of my child.  It just keeps going and going.  A story no one gives a flying fuck about.  Who could care about this?  Dude, a lot of people care about Ann Coulter calling John Edwards a faggot, okay?  It's the top story on MSNBC right now.  Yeah, I guess.  So how long were you guys going out, Roger?  Um, at the time of a couple years, but I've got an 11-year-old daughter from her now that  I got custody of.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Care, care, care.  Who gives a shit?  Aye.  Who cares what you're fucking saying? 
[03:26:00]  And yeah, I'm talking to you.  Dude, some people still support Bush.  It says our strategy recognizes the hard truth.  Yeah, I know.  That they're in Iraq for the long haul.  They say that it's live, a speech, CNN.  Yep.  I know you're a liberal douchebag, but some people do like Bush.  A liberal douchebag today.  Okay.  Yeah.  Roger, so did anyone catch you guys having sex?  No, we got away with it.  God damn, would you shut the fuck up about this?  No one cares.  Your story, your story, the one you're telling right now, the one you're saying right now, 
[03:26:30]  no one cares.  No one cares.  Dude.  No one gives a shit.  People are concerned because Giuliani's son is trashing his father, okay?  He's going to call for president.  And if his own son is trashing him, you know, what is the rest of the country supposed to think?  I know.  Plus, there was a picture in the paper over the weekend, and Giuliani was in that dress.  It's a little weird if you're trying to become president of the United States.  I know, but no one cares.  I don't think anyone cares about that is what I'm saying.  So were you able to repeat that, Roger, or was it one and done with the girlfriend in the hospital  after the rotator cuff surgery? 
[03:27:00]  No, it was one and done.  Shut up.  You.  No, you on the phone.  You on the phone.  Talking.  Shut the fuck up.  No one cares.  Just no one cares.  I don't care.  No one in this fucking room cares.  Do you get it now?  Punching out, guys.  Yeah, it sucks to be you.  I just ran out of current news stories.  Yeah, well, no one cares about that turn down Dealey Plaza they made.  You boring fuck. 
[03:27:30]  We love our listeners.  We adore them.  Let's go to Rick in Westchester.  Rick.  Just a beautiful children.  Yeah, what time I had sex with my wife?  Frunk!  That a boy.  Way to get to the point.  Best story of the day.  Cut to the chase.  He fucking got right to the point.  He fucked his wife and frunk us out.  Yeah, let's go to David in North Carolina.  David.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I got a blowjob from my nurse at 4.30 in the morning when I was in the hospital once. 
[03:28:00]  How do you swing that?  He was a male nurse.  The angel of death sucked his pop before he smothered an old person.  He's the maintenance man.  Wait, David.  How do you pull that off, really?  Yeah, how do you swing getting a blowjob in a hospital from a nurse?  How were you?  Why were you in the hospital, first of all?  Hot in here.  Well, they thought I had a heart attack, and they had all these freaking flies.  Well, that's nice.  Wait a minute.  He's fucking sucking your dick.  And you're in there because they thought you had a heart attack. 
[03:28:30]  That's good.  Let's get his pulse rate up.  Fucking weak heart on because of blood thinner they're giving him.  I noticed every time she came in a room, her nipples were fucking hard.  So I'm like, I asked her why her headlights were shining every time she came in.  Yeah.  Well, I reached up and just started playing with the fucking things.  And then one thing that don't matter is that.  This is some fantasy.  Dude, that was the drugs talk.  It's a dumb story.  No, it's not true.  I wasn't on no drugs, but they were coming in there every two hours. 
[03:29:00]  It's a lie.  I asked her to make a long story short.  I asked her what later did it with.  I'm going to make a false story true.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to make a bullshit story.  Tell us about the time you titty-fucked the girl at Sloan Kettering.  Here's how that story actually went.  Well, this nurse came in and had to change my bedpan.  And while I was shitting and trying to make eye contact with her,  I wondered what it would be like to fuck her.  It's a completely uninterested woman.  We interrupt this program to breathe.  The ozone midget sighting of the day. 
[03:29:30]  Keith, did you see this coming?  No.  Yeah.  Tim in New York, what's up?  Tim.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Yeah.  I was up in White Plains up in Westchester checking out Reno 911,  which would save your money, guys.  And I go to give my ticket to the girl.  And she was like maybe 4'3", I don't know, with these little midget arms.  I mean, like, they barely went past, like, her tits, man.  And she's trying to grab me with these little sausage fingers, 
[03:30:00]  grabbing my ticket and ripping it in half.  Funniest thing I ever saw.  My brothers were laughing, telling me, I got to call you guys.  The fidget working at the movies, ripping your ticket with those stubby little Vienna sausage fingers.  When she went on break, did she take a nap in one of the popcorn buckets?  I don't know, boys, but that's it.  Took a shower under the soda machine.  Imagine what she must look like with those big boxes of, like, milk duds. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Just, like, as big as she is.  Oh, my God, I can't eat all that.  Oh, wait a minute.  You're just small.  You're just little.  Right.  Hand it to me so it looks normal in my hand.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Oh, brother.  Hey, uh, let's break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  We're not part of regular radio, you fuckhead.  I'm scared.  Anthony.  We take nothing and make shit out of it.  Okay, toss it.  Los muchachos con ghetto.  What a hot voice that is. 
[03:31:00]  Wonderful.  Huevos grandes, como melones.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Rub it.  Punch out, shitheads.  All right, hey, uh, we've had a theme all morning long.  We have one more story, believe it or not.  Less than 24 hours after being married, husband runs wife over.  Wow.  Fuck you.  24 hours.  He couldn't take it after 24 hours.  Oh, lucky guy.  Still have the just married on the back of the car in the cans. 
[03:31:30]  She was hit by the cans.  Tickle, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink off her head.  Clink.  Still has some rice in his hair.  Picking rice out of the treads of his tires.  Hasn't even brought the tux back yet.  Yeah, he's still driving in his truck.  Has a Viagra in the pocket of his tux.  Jesus.  That's lovely.  Are you kidding me?  What would lead a guy to do that 24 hours?  Oh, this is, uh...  Did she, uh, did she start yelling at the groom's mother about the brother? 
[03:32:00]  Wow.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking bitch.  That's funny how you get the girl.  Man, we're so jaded at, bitch, he had to do something.  Fucking bitch.  No, he means his wife.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, on my wedding day, my wife is all hammered just yelling at my mother about my brother  who was attempting to pick up, uh, my brand new wife's, uh, uh, cousin.  So my brother was, like, making moves on this girl. 
[03:32:30]  And my wife there at the time, you know, drinking and shit.  And, and she got all pissed off at my brother.  And gets right in my mother's face and goes,  Your fucking son is a fucking whore, fucking, whole bag, motherfucker.  I'm just standing there going, I've been married for about two hours.  This could be long.  Were you embarrassed?  This could take a while.  Oh, of course I was. 
[03:33:00]  You were right, right?  Who wouldn't be?  I ran for fucking Captain Morgan to bail me out so quickly.  Did you try, did you ever try to cover up for her by, like, going,  Yeah, like, you talk a little louder because she's about to say something stupid.  Oh, all those things.  All those things, Jimmy.  All those things.  You know how someone's saying something, and you can just sense where they're going,  and as they go,  Yeah.  And she's like, yeah, no, no, no, right, yeah.  Yeah.  I had to talk like this for nine years.  In every conversation, 24 hours a day.  She's kidding.  She's kidding. 
[03:33:30]  But you did it nine years.  Nine fucking years.  Why?  After the, that was a big sign right there.  That's the question I can't answer, Keith.  I mean, after that, you go to your, to your, to the preacher,  or whoever did the, to the wedding for you, go, let's take this back.  Fucking Charles Ingalls.  What?  You know what?  That's what, that's what we do on a black neighborhood.  Well, I went to a justice of the peace.  That's what us whiteys do.  Go to a justice of the peace.  Yeah, it was, I guess because I, it sucked, but, but I was, you know, I was kind of drinking 
[03:34:00]  too at the time, so it didn't really, like, matter much.  She was always, like, screaming when she drank.  Uh, so I would just, like, drink to kind of counteract the whole thing.  To take, to take a screaming.  Oh, it was awful.  But then when I hooked up, uh, with Ope with the radio thing.  What?  Like, that gave me, yes.  Oh.  That gave me a whole new, like, life.  I, then all I had to concentrate on was radio.  So, I didn't care that I was miserable like that. 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  And that's, so.  And that's kind of why we got along so well.  I was just driven.  Like, let's fucking get to the top of this radio thing.  This is cool.  I explained to people, like, ah, that part of my life sucks, but we got this thing and  it's taken off, so we'll just focus on this.  Yeah.  And then once that kicked in, then it was over.  Then it was, like, there was no fucking reason to, uh, hang out with, to take this shit.  Wow.  But nine years.  Especially when I have a 20-year-old girlfriend. 
[03:35:00]  There's no reason to take this shit.  Hence the burning of everything he owned.  Oh, that's the greatest thing, getting a younger girl.  It's beautiful.  All right.  Because you do the math, she's going to be around a lot longer, can do more.  So, by the time you can be whatever age you are, like, I'm 40.  So, I have a young girl, she's 23.  See, and it just makes sense.  My son's mom, she's 40 now.  You know, she's just about finished.  The other girl is still sparking up.  So, by the time I'm 60, she's still gone, and I'm still, you know, I'm hanging in there. 
[03:35:30]  So, it's just a good thing to math.  It's just right.  My young girl thinks your stories are still interesting and fun.  She's still caught up in the whole comedian thing.  Like, you do that in front of people.  She thinks it's cool, right?  Yes.  Jeez.  Hey, look at the time.  So, the story.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  No, this is a girl.  I'm just going to have to feed the cat and then me.  Like that.  That's the point.  That's it.  Same food.  Clean shit out of the litter box and my diaper.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Well, you'll be annoyed and you'll notice that, like, one of your little dessert treats has  litter on it, but you want one to offend her, you'll eat it anyway.  This doesn't smell like chocolate.  Eat it.  Why don't you die?  I'd love to feed cat shit to someone.  What's cat shit rules?  Oh, yeah.  I told that story.  We used to fucking drink at my friend's house and we would get stoned and I would take all  the cat shit out of the litter box and put it in the newspaper and then fold it back  up so when his father came home from work, he'd open the paper and fucking catwalked 
[03:36:30]  with the bottom.  What a jerk.  All right, here's the story.  The last marriage story for today.  It's been an ongoing theme since six o'clock this morning.  Here you go.  James O'Line and Katie Martindale went to Las Vegas to tie the knot over the weekend.  Then they headed back home to Utah.  But at some point, things took a turn for the worse and they started to argue.  Husband and wife traveling, having a domestic in their car as they were moving.  So the couple pulls over and the bride got out. 
[03:37:00]  Her groom followed her, but he didn't stay out on the street for long.  She climbed out of the vehicle.  They continued arguing the roadway and then he got in the car and based on witness information,  he ran her over.  Neighbors saw what happened and called for help.  It wasn't traveling at a high rate of speed.  She got out of the car and was walking away from the vehicle and he rolled down and struck  her and she fell down and he ran her over.  Bullwine was arrested and taken away.  The unhappy couple hadn't even unpacked the trunk of their car or taken their new marriage 
[03:37:30]  license into their home.  Guys, cut your losses, move on.  Get out of the way quick.  Oh, well, there you go.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  There you go.  And just hours earlier, gazing into each other's eyes, dancing.  It happens in a moment.  Something happened.  Boy, that was quick.  Dancing to James Blunt or something.  Whatever it was playing.  Yeah, see, you're with us.  Yeah, it's a song on the radio and turn to the channel.  That's right there.  Why do you want me to change the channel? 
[03:38:00]  Is that like that song means something to you?  Is it you and your old boyfriend's song?  They're dancing.  Next thing you know, it's on.  And it's like, what the fuck?  This isn't our wedding song.  Why are you playing this?  This isn't James Blunt, right?  No.  Do you have that You're Beautiful?  That fucking song.  I want to blow towards his face.  You're beautiful.  He's such a cunt.  Wow, you sound just like him.  I know.  Do it again, Jimmy.  You're beautiful.  Hold on, hold on.  I've got to close my eyes because it's really so close to the original. 
[03:38:30]  All right, go ahead.  You're beautiful.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was it.  It's really good.  I thought they actually started playing the song.  I fucking hate this fucking whiny pussy boy song.  Goodbye, my lover.  Goodbye, my friend.  All right.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  All right, go ahead.  Goodbye, my lover.  Goodbye, my friend.  Shit.  I'm trying to yank a tear out of me, fucko.  I'm like, goodbye, my balls.  Goodbye, my male dignity.  Fucking. 
[03:39:00]  This fucking pussy.  You don't like when someone tries to yank a tear out of you?  Disgusts me.  It does.  As much as your ass is disgusting, it's really bad.  How about yanking a load out of me?  Yeah, you yanked some tears out of us today because of those farts.  Nothing?  All right.  Good Lord.  These songs are good.  They get you more time with a girl after you left if you want to get her back.  It's pure, pure, pure.  I love it, pure.  I saw an angel.  An angel. 
[03:39:30]  Of that I'm sure.  Sure.  This fucking affected cocksucker.  I saw an angel.  I love a man.  I'm on my hand.  But I won't lose no sleep on night.  Because I've got a plan.  A plan.  What a phony fuck.  You're beautiful.  Ugh.  You're beautiful.  I think I like this song.  You're beautiful.  It stinks and I don't like it.  This fucking song eats my ass.  You can act like a man. 
[03:40:00]  What's the matter with you?  And I don't know why.  You want to write the iTunes and get this song?  Yeah, right on.  Let's do Lion of the Day and get the hell out of here.  Lion.  Keith Robinson's going to be at a casino.  Catcher Rising Star.  I'm probably going to throw it on.  You have a number?  No.  Not quite.  Why would I?  Keith is the worst plugger.  So Keith is tonight.  That's tomorrow night, Wednesday night in Providence.  And for Thursday through Sunday, I'll be in Pittsburgh at the Improv.  So if you're in Pittsburgh. 
[03:40:30]  He's a good plugger when it comes with ten other guys and an innocent girl in a room.  During a boring science class.  Jesus.  Florentine had good train stories about Keith.  Just what a piece of shit he was on the train.  How mean he was to girls.  The guy's fucking brutal.  He just grabs her hair and fucking yells at him.  Here's one of the runner-up lines of the day.  And it's like, it's your wife.  She's supposed to sit there and make sure the plates are nice and clean when dignitaries come over. 
[03:41:00]  Pick out the silverware.  That's what you're supposed to do as a first lady.  Give a tour.  Pick up brains off of the trunk.  She's a very educated woman there, Anthony.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That was a great line.  Pick up brains off of the trunk.  Yeah.  What a fucking job of the first lady.  Pretty much stepped all over that, too.  That's what you didn't know.  Bodogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  You don't have to mix and match everything you love.  Huh?  You don't have to mix and match everything.  Some things are better separate.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:41:30]  I love oral sex.  I love egg salad.  Never together.  We don't mind talking about our girls from time to time to time.  Very good.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I should have let that sit there for a little bit.  Trying to get better at that.  Very good.  I think Opie's winning interruption of the day.  Yeah, what the fuck, dude?  That would have been just as good if you let him do his line instead of making me look  like a complete non-listening asshole.  Interrupted line of the day.  Twice.  That's a pretty funny bit, though.  Yeah.  We step on each other.  It's fucking happened. 
[03:42:00]  Yep.  Well, I'm trying to focus on the next thing, and sometimes I miss a doozy, but you don't  have to, like, stop the entire show and focus on it.  Who fucking, who did that?  Who tried to humiliate the boss?  E-Rock's giving me back.  It's E-Rock.  See?  Is it?  Fucking old.  It's E-Rock.  See, in the end, these guys got the last say.  Where is he?  Check anywhere.  Things that concern work aren't being done.  You want to feel my back right now?  I'm sweating like a pig because I'm so uncomfortable.  Oh, no.  Because it's a great line, both of you guys, and there I am being an interrupting ass.  Interrupting ass.  You didn't end up the line, did you? 
[03:42:30]  I don't know, but, you know, it's kind of nice to think that you're listening to this  stuff if you're part of the show.  We really, it's amazing how unprofessional this thing is on a daily basis, and it just works.  It keeps rolling.  If I was just silent, people would have been like, oh, yeah, they were all listening,  but I wasn't even listening.  That's the first thing you need to do if you do this shit.  This shit.  It was, they actually should have let it play because you gave yourself a little beating  after it, which made it funny.  Yeah, well, why do that?  And save, you know, save me a little bit. 
[03:43:00]  It was funny that you gave yourself a quick fucking, a quick, like, a religious beating  where they fucking beat themselves with a sharp thing.  Uncomfortable, uncomfortable, uncomfortable.  Stay uncomfortable.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, how about letting the funny come out as they say on the message boards?  Oh, please let it happen again on this one.  I will walk, and I won't be back.  And half of the message boards won't give a shit.

They should have Eric and Kathy split on the billboard, and they should have him wearing  a Chicago Cubs uniform, and it should say bunt, and then have him. 
[03:44:00]  Bunt.  He'd work in white socks with something else, I'm sure.  White socks.  She liked black.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, there's a picture of Albert Bell standing behind him with a hammer.  Oh, no!  That was like, I hate these guys.  That was team, that was team after the week.  I'm like, all right, Jimmy, you got a line of the day, and then I got my hopes up.  Ooh, it's me, it's me, and then it ends with you. 
[03:44:30]  I don't know what the line was.  It wasn't the Albert Bell line.  Yeah, Albert Bell, that's really funny, right?  Team effort.  That was a, yeah, community line of the segment of the day.  Why don't you fucking, we should all whistle a little fucking sweet Georgia Brown and kick  Eric in the stomach.  Makes like we're throwing him into the crowd.  Why are we going to kick Eric in the stomach?  We love Eric.  No, we don't.  No.  I just, he has a fucking mark in his head today from his headphones where it's in his  stupid, this boy's life hairdo, and I want, I want to fucking, I want to comb his hair 
[03:45:00]  with a fucking aluminum bat.  Look at the, look at the, let me see, turn to, look at that.  Yeah.  A little mark.  Hey, Sex Bagel, why would you make the Opster look so bad today with the lines of the day?  Get over there, Mike.  Don't talk to the fucking Opster from over there.  You know I need all the help I could get.  Why would you do that to me?  It was written as a team effort.  Because I made fun of your haircut?  Oh, why?  I thought, I like your haircut.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  No, it was written down as a Jimmy Opie line. 
[03:45:30]  So that's what I cut it.  Yeah, well, we don't like you to humiliate the boss.  We don't like it.  All right, what are we working on for tomorrow, Iraq?  Oh, Jim.  What?  Talk to him.  We have that.  Hold on.  Can Steve stop fucking sashaying around the studio with a scarf on?  Sashaying.  Are you making fun of the one they did?  Oh, fuck.  This will be good for people that were listening earlier.  Remember that awful MacBook promo? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  They redid that promo.  Thank God.  More appropriately to our audience.  Geared more to this program than our audience.  There's a bunch of new people.  You might have to listen to the replay, but basically for the MacBook, free FM, we had nothing  to do with it.  The people over there decided to put a cute little promo together where it's just a bunch  of like, I don't know, 20-somethings, maybe mid to late 20-somethings sitting around in  a coffee shop.  Dude, did you hear Opie and Anthony have a MacBook karaoke contest? 
[03:46:30]  Wow, dude, I'm karaoke king.  Oh, dude, really, dude?  Well, you can't.  It was just this two guys and a girl, and it sounded awful.  And she went, sweet.  Sweet.  Yeah, they're obviously just hanging downtown.  They're just being...  Yeah, hey, I got fries.  Dude, who cares about your fries?  O and A got a...  Whatever with your fries, dude.  Like, they had to kind of get into it somehow.  We could at least play the first part, because that's all that matters.  It's horrid.  Because I've got to bring everyone up to speed. 
[03:47:00]  Just shit on a CD, smear it around, and put it in the player, and that will play.  These guys think this is good, because they both walked in to hand it in.  Oh, wow.  Like, just...  All right.  I want you to see my face, and I want you to see my face as I hand it to you.  All right, this is just the first part, but you'll get the idea.  Free FM.  I just had fries.  Yeah, whatever about your fries, dude.  Did you hear that Opie and Anthony are giving away the new MacBook?  Oh, sweet.  Nice. 
[03:47:30]  How'd I win?  You just have to sing a little karaoke.  Oh, dude, remember last weekend?  I'm the karaoke king.  I want to text you up.  Oh, yeah.  Big time, because you don't stop, baby.  I love you.  Yeah.  We remember that.  You should never do that again in public.  Ever.  But I'm awesome.  No, you're not.  Are you a karaoke king or queen?  I am a tag.  Then, MacBook karaoke.  All right.  By the way, way to promote a karaoke thing.  You should never do that in public. 
[03:48:00]  You fucking idiotic bitch.  What a castrating woman.  Of course, she's got to cut his balls off.  Guy can't have some fun without that fucking overly mothering bitch running in and just  wrecking everything.  Fucking hen.  Shut your mouth, you castrating hen.  Hen.  That really brings them down to a really shitty level.  You fucking hen.  You can see a hen.  It's a fat, irritating thing that just shits out food. 
[03:48:30]  A tiny little stupid head.  Big fat body.  Just walking around.  Doesn't know what it's doing.  It should be killed and it will be.  Just shitting and laying eggs.  That's all it does.  And making noise all willy-nilly.  You don't understand it.  You don't want to hear it.  Half the time, you're not sure if it took a dump or laid an egg.  It has no clue.  It really brings a woman down to an awful level, Jimmy.  You fucking hen. 
[03:49:00]  You hen.  The brain is so useless, it runs around when it's not even a hat.  Oh, you can cut its head off and it'll still fucking run around for a while.  You don't want to hear it because they're just a breed.  Just breed and drop an egg and stop your yapping.  The body's showing the head who's blocked.  I don't need you.  Little teeny head.  Little stupid head.  With that thing.  That little thing.  Little thing under their chin.  I know the turkey one is bigger, but the chicken's in the head. 
[03:49:30]  They have a thing.  They have a thing.  Yapping.  All right.  Well, the guys.  Steve, Derek, who else needs credit?  E-Rock.  And E-  What?  Yep.  Uh-oh.  And E-  Now it's going to stop.  He plays the fucking, I guarantee Eric's the hole.  I hope so.  Just wait.  All right.  Free FM.  I just had fries.  Yeah, whatever about your fries, dude.  Did you hear that Opie and Anthony are giving away the new MacBook?  Oh, it's so weird.  Nice.  How'd I win?  You just have to sing a little karaoke.  Oh, dude, remember last weekend on the Karaoke King?  Hi, I'm Eric Nagel from the Opie and Anthony Show, 
[03:50:00]  and I'd like to apologize for the brutality you just heard, 
[03:50:30]  but I simply had to dispose of those inseparable jerks  before they did any more damage to our promotional message.  You see, I'm here to tell you about the Opie and Anthony MacBook Karaoke Contest.  All you have to do is go to 923freefm.com,  pick from the list of songs we've chosen, and sing your little heart out.  I wanna sing...  Sing your little heart out for about a minute and send it to us.  We've got five MacBooks to give out,  one a day for the ones we think are the best.  See, that wasn't so difficult,  and we certainly didn't need to hear from all those hipster coffeehouse dopes. 
[03:51:00]  Do the Caesar.  Good delivery, Eric.  See, I love the turn. It's fantastic.  We certainly don't need to hear those coffeehouse dopes. 
[03:51:30]  Dopes, yes.  Eric doesn't have a... He's not meant to be cutting and sarcastic.  Yeah, yeah. See, now there's the only...  The problem I see with this is Eric Nagel is not the fucking tough guy  that runs people over, gets out of the vehicle, and starts machine-gunning them down.  It's the unexpected ones.  Yeah, I don't know.  You don't expect it from him.  That's why there's a reason.  It doesn't work to have him be, like, the loose cannon who finally had enough  and just machine-gunned people.  The sound works.  But him doing the voiceover, because Eric's sweet. 
[03:52:00]  Eric's a victim.  He's not one who victimizes.  Right.  Eric is a victim.  But that's why he's victimizing, because, you know, he's had it.  Yeah, but in some parodies that works, but it doesn't work in this...  Can you play the end of that again?  Oh, my God.  Do you have, like, the last 30 seconds, the last 15 seconds of him talking,  where he goes, like, the sarcastic guy?  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, please.  He's in there sweating and drinking a lot of fluids right now.  Is he?  Look at his forehead.  He's all beaded.  There's a lot of gulping going on.  Yeah, he's a...  He's all dry-mouthed.  Well, he's once again proving that he's a very talented guy in some areas, 
[03:52:30]  yet to be determined.  However, his acting is not up to snuff.  Someone wants to know.  Second to Steve's.  What's in sepit?  Exactly, in sepit.  Oh, yeah, he mispronounced that one.  I know.  It was in sepit?  Yes, it was in sepit, yes.  In sepit.  In sepit.  You realize who you're talking to, Steve.  I know you wrote that.  In sepit.  Hold on.  Here he is.  All right.  Here he comes.  Yeah, grab that mic there.  Now, the...  What did you think of your performance on that?  I'm not good. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  Fucking guy defuses it.  Mark that, Tony.  Thank you.  Mark the time when he said that,  and I need that on my machine tomorrow.  I'm not good.  Fucking defuses everything, though.  Where do you go from there?  We go there.  I'll tell you where we go from there,  to the understatement he just spit out.  It's like saying the atomic bomb,  well, it wasn't pleasant.  All right, here's the end.  In sepit.  Any more damage to our promotional message.  You see, I'm here to tell you about the Opie and Anthony MacBook Karaoke Contest. 
[03:53:30]  All you have to do is go to 923freefm.com,  pick from the list of songs we've chosen,  and sing your little heart out.  I want to sing.  Sing your little heart out for about a minute and send it to us.  We've got five MacBooks to give out,  one a day for the ones we think are the best.  See, that wasn't so difficult,  and we certainly didn't need to hear from all those hipster coffeehouse jokes.  Shut your goddamn piehole!  All right.  All right. 
[03:54:00]  That was fun.  Well, sorry, Eric.  Better than the first one, I guess.  Keith, are you going to come back or what?  Yeah, man.  Maybe next time you won't be late?  Oh, man, I'm sorry.  That was just traffic, man.  Yeah.  A lot of traffic.  It's all right.  You were hurt.  Well, black man, I'm supposed to be late.  Yeah.  Makes a show, you know,  you can have something right away once I get there.  It's like, look who's late.  Of course he's late.  I'm the L word.  The L word.  We're late Americans. 
[03:54:30]  Keith, you were very funny.  You've got to come back soon, okay?  Thank you, man.  And Jimmy, stop fucking farting.  I can't do it.  My stomach is passing.  It's almost done.  It is amazing.  It's going to be like fucking walking into a bar when they were smoking,  and then you leave and you smell like smoke.  We're going to smell like your fucking ass.  It's going to just be in our clothes.  He's got food poisoning farts.  No, because I don't feel food poisoning sick.  I was just ill yesterday.  Secondhand shit.  I wasn't food poisoning sick. 
[03:55:00]  What?  I wasn't food poisoning sick yesterday.  It was more a wooziness, which I felt.  How do you know?  Because I was woozy on Friday, and then I got.  You died first yourself?  No, no, no, no.  I was woozy on Friday.  No, no, no, no.  And then Saturday I felt much better.  And then Sunday my girlfriend made fish, so I'm like, well, maybe it's the fish.  Were there worms in it?  No, no, no, no.  But then Monday morning I didn't feel very good, and I went home.  And he's gone.  And I feel better now.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  But I think it might be the fish. 
[03:55:30]  How fucking, what, is a trout going to swim out your ass and then we don't have to worry anymore?  I don't know.  I think it's the fish.  You stink.  This room is, it just reeks.  Sounds like I fucking swallowed two of Eric's acting lessons.  Yeah, he was really, really bad.  Those coughs, they're hip-y-hats.  Yeah, like he was trying a little too hard.  Yeah, you could see his head actually moving as he talked.  That should have been one more gunshot.  Just one more gunshot.  Yeah.  You hear his fucking toe looking for the trigger? 
[03:56:00]  Let's get out of here, man.  I got to shit.  Oh, you got to, yeah, go shit.  All right.  Very good.  Keith, tonight, Rhode Island.  Me this week in Pittsburgh.  Bye.  I'm going to have my own show today.  Are you going to stay for a little while?  I'm doing my own show.  It would be funny.  They fired me in open and you and Keith just got hired?  Hey.  I said my own show.  Well, Keith, you got to have a co-host.  N-word.  We call it N-word.  Whatever.  N-E-N.  The G-E-N.  The G-E-N.  The G-E-N show.  Guinea. 
[03:56:30]  I like that.  I actually don't mind any Italian slurs.  They've never bothered me.  Yeah.  Guinea-wop.  Well, the W-N-N.  Grease ball.  Where did we go?  The W-N-N.  Wop.  Guinea-wop.  Grease ball.  There you go.  Bastards.  Like, it doesn't bother Italians.  Unless an N calls us that, then we break out the bats and go to jail forever.  If an N asks you for directions, you break out the bats.  I don't want no Ns calling me the W-N.  It just sounds ridiculous with these letters. 
[03:57:00]  All right.  That was my show.  I'm done.  It's taken easy.  Yeah, really.  I'm getting out of here, too.  What day is it?  Tuesday?  Yeah.  Tomorrow's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Mm-hmm.  Be prepared.  Girls, get your easily accessible clothing on.  Guys, make sure you have a wow sticker on your vehicle.  That's all you got to do.  And girls will wow you.  And tomorrow's booby day.  And tomorrow's booby day.  Yes.  Hopefully, we'll get the girls to show up for booby day.  And that's it.  We will see you.  Same bat time. 
[03:57:30]  Same bat station.  Tomorrow.  Thank you very much.  I just wanted to see a fucking...  I want to thank everybody.  I know.  I'm just trying to fuck with them.  Oh.  I just want to see a fucking Errol Flynn throws his scarf back on and floats into the room.  Fucking asshole.  Errol Flynn.  Hi.  I'm the Cavalier producer.  Is there a meeting today or something?  Not for me.  There's not.  What?  Copy.  Oh, so you come in here to make sure...  You are like a fucking mother making sure someone gets their homework done. 
[03:58:00]  Like, would you think I was just going to walk out so you walk here to make sure I don't leave?  I have to get out.  Yeah, look at him.  Wow.  Intercepting Opie.  You're fucking good.  No, you got copy, though.  Are you guys still broadcasting?  Yeah.  I was doing my own show, and it sucks.  I forgot my BlackBerry.  It's the only reason I'm back.  Oh.  Oh, it smells like cheese.  It really smells like ass in here.  Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Opie.  Anthony. 
[03:58:30]  Dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na.  Na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you'd like to vote on any of the weekly show polls, go to iliketolisten.com. </pre>
