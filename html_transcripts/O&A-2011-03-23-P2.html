<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a recap of the main broadcast, focusing on Anthony's detailed description of his apocalypse "go-bag" and humorous voicemails from a seemingly deranged woman.  Producer Troy Kwan joined the discussion, contributing his own apocalypse preparedness anecdotes, including a friend's self-sufficient home in Maine, sparking a broader conversation on survival strategies.  Actor Stephen Lang, guest on the show, prompted a comedic bit involving a replay of Larry King's infamous misquotation of a line from *A Few Good Men*.  This evolved into a lengthy segment where the hosts and callers recreated Larry King's misinterpretations of other famous movie lines.  Intern Gabe from the Ron and Fez show also appeared, adding to the apocalypse discussion by questioning the hypothetical scenario's parameters.

The show then shifted to a discussion of E-Rock's difficult morning, with Opie criticizing his performance. E-Rock blamed technical issues with the Sirius XM "Profit" audio system.  Next, Jimmy Norton's recent appearance on the *Tonight Show* was highlighted, followed by a replay of a two-year-old segment featuring "Ted the Cake Maker," which focused heavily on *Ace of Cakes*.  This segment included various discussions about cake-making, shipping cakes, and cake-related anecdotes.

The final segment featured audio clips from the recording session for Club Soda Kenny's cover of Rebecca Black's "Friday," emphasizing Kenny's challenging behavior during the recording process.  Minor studio mishaps, involving a banner and a light fixture, occurred near the end.  Ron Bennington briefly appeared, sharing a story about seeing Andre the Giant naked backstage. The show concluded with Sam Roberts mentioning Elizabeth Taylor's recent death, prompting Anthony to immediately make a joke about Richard Burton punching her.  Ron Bennington also discussed his father's habit of listening to the show and checking for mentions of his son.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. I'm Sam Roberts.  Here with all the guys.  Other than Opie and Anthony, of course, they went home.  That's what they do at 10 o'clock.  They got better things to do.  But, we're still here, uh,  talking about not only stuff that happened on today's show,  but stuff that's happening in the Opie and Anthony world, uh, 
[00:00:30]  it was a good show today.  And the reason was that yesterday,  Anthony got into some of the crazy people that are in his life  in terms of the voicemails he was playing from this, uh, woman.  They kept leaving him voicemails.  Today, he proved how insane he actually is  with the conversation of his go-bag  and, uh, being ready for the apocalypse.  I would, Troy Kwan's not still in there. 
[00:01:00]  Is he, Iraq? I can't see.  No, he's not here.  Because that's a guy that I would assume,  Troy Kwan, one of our producers,  who I would assume is probably ready for an apocalypse.  Uh, there he is.  There's Troy Kwan.  Run up the hallway.  I want to know if he's ready for the apocalypse.  Are you ready for the apocalypse?  I heard, yeah, I mean,  Ant kind of went on about his go-bag today.  And to me, there's Troy's music.  To me, uh,  that seemed like it would be right up your alley,  the apocalypse stuff.  Oh, I love it, dude.  I'm preparing myself.  Are you, are some of the things Anthony's saying, 
[00:01:30]  are you starting to be like, that's a, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I actually have some friends  that are actually building, um,  I forget what they call it,  like a, a container house.  A container house?  Yeah, up in Maine.  And, uh, they're getting ready as well.  What's it made?  What do you mean a container?  Is it above ground?  Yeah, it's like a container,  and then you can actually just,  it goes up on a truck,  and then you build a house in it.  And, uh, he actually has a website.  I don't know it offhand,  but, uh, he photographed his,  his journey of building it.  It's on a truck?  No, no, no.  They bring it in on a truck. 
[00:02:00]  Uh-huh.  Like, you know, uh,  think of like a,  like a tractor trailer truck.  So what makes it apocalypse-proof?  It sounds weaker than a house.  Well, it's way up in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, I got you.  So that's not where you live.  And it's solar-powered,  and it's...  Oh, so it doesn't need...  It's self-contained.  Yes.  Are you going to get a satellite phone,  do you think?  No.  I just know that...  Should I tell you what I'm doing  when the apocalypse comes?  I would say if  would be a more suitable word,  but go ahead.  No, no, all hell's going to break loose. 
[00:02:30]  It's just a matter of when.  Is there...  Do you know when, or...  No.  You don't know that?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Okay, but what...  When the inevitable does happen,  what's your...  Because I don't have a plan.  I was going to just kind of ride the wave.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Well, the first thing is,  I mean, I hope I'm not in Manhattan,  but if I am,  that's...  I have to get to the other side  of the Hudson River.  And that's one of my fears  of living in a borough.  Yeah.  Like, I don't want to live  in Brooklyn or Queens  because it's like,  then you have to get  through Manhattan to New Jersey.  So you live in Manhattan now? 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  And your plan would just be  to get to a bridge?  Get to New Jersey,  and from there,  I'm going to live with the Amish.  In Pennsylvania?  In Pennsylvania.  So you're gonna...  Do you have any plan  on how you can get  to the bridge or tunnel?  Would you do a tunnel?  Or is that too risky?  Tunnel's a little too risky.  I'd rather swim...  Than take a tunnel.  Than take a tunnel, yes.  You'd swim across  the Hudson River  in the middle of the apocalypse.  Instead of going through  a tunnel?  Okay.  I mean,  I'm just saying  because waves  and things like that...  I just... 
[00:03:30]  I got that adrenaline going  and I gotta go.  You know what I mean?  And once you get to Jersey...  I'll figure it out from there.  Some mode of transportation.  I'll walk.  To Pennsylvania,  to Amish country.  Yes.  Through a state.  If I have to?  If I have to do it  in order to survive,  yes, I will do it.  Well, I'm glad...  E-Rock,  do you have a survival plan  for the apocalypse?  I'll probably just go to Florida.  Write it out.  Probably just go to Florida,  which is already  a hurricane state.  Get on a plane  during the apocalypse.  It's not safe  to go to Florida  in summer, 
[00:04:00]  let alone in the apocalypse.  I've been through  several hurricanes.  I'm fine.  How about this?  In this one,  intern Gabe from Ron and Fez  just came in here.  I'm sure that you  have something worked out.  I just...  Let me...  Go ahead.  I just have a question.  What kind of apocalypse is it?  Are we dealing with...  I mean...  Is it a zombie apocalypse  or something?  Well, that's stupid.  Yeah, that's stupid.  That doesn't make any sense.  That's fiction.  Yeah.  But do you know  what kind of apocalypse  it'll be?  What are you predicting?  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  the entire power grid  could go out.  Do you think it'll be  a natural disaster  or do you think  it'll be something  we've created? 
[00:04:30]  Well, I mean,  that's...  Like the power grid.  That's a good question.  I mean,  a lot of times they say  HAARP is going to create  natural disasters.  Well, what?  I mean,  that's what they say.  I feel like we're going  down a road  that's just hard  to get back from.  I don't know.  It could be a natural disaster  or it could be  something man-made  that they call  a natural disaster.  What a great way  to...  They call...  Well...  Powers that be.  Conspiracy.  Gabe, you worry...  Well, you're worried  about zombies  so I wouldn't be  calling Troy stupid.  Exactly.  You know?  I just wanted to make sure.  Well, Troy,  I'm glad that you're prepared.  I'm ready. 
[00:05:00]  E-Rock obviously  has his plan.  I'm just sitting  on the beach.  And intern Gabe  is looking at comic books  or something.  Stephen Lang  was in here  from Avatar.  He thought Anthony  was a little crazy  for his whole theories.  But the reason  I love Stephen Lang  being in here  was what we brought up  in the interview  that he was the guy  who was part of  the infamous  Larry King clip  when Larry King  misquoted  A Few Good Men.  You know,  maybe one of the most  famous movie lines  in the history of film  was misquoted 
[00:05:30]  by Larry King  and it led to  one of my favorite  and I'm sure  most of your favorite  Larry King  mocking bits  of all time  which we will play  right now.  This is Larry King  can't quote a movie  on After Opie  and Anthony Live.  After Opie  and Anthony Live.  What was that accent,  Stephen?  Where is he from?  That's a...  That's a marine accent.  It's been my experience  that the Jarhead clan  almost has their own  vernacular,  their own accent. 
[00:06:00]  I'd say there's a bit  of Virginia in there,  a little Tidewater Virginia  and maybe a few  other things as well.  It's made up.  Do you remember the movie  A Few Good Men  where Jack Nicholson  played that incredible part?  Well, Stephen Lang  did it on Broadway  and he was incredible  with that great line,  right?  You wouldn't know  the truth.  You can't handle  the truth.  Yeah.  You wouldn't know  the truth. 
[00:06:30]  I think we laughed  at the end.  Listen to that.  That great line.  Listen to Larry  at the end of it.  And he was incredible  with that great line,  right?  You wouldn't know  the truth.  You can't handle  the truth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever it was.  That great line.  Look, man,  I don't know a lot  of movie lines,  but I certainly  know that one.  That one's a tough  one to get wrong.  That famous line,  I love the smell  of lip balm  in the morning. 
[00:07:00]  Smells like  unchapped lips.  What?  Yeah.  Let's say hi  to Larry King  on line one.  I knew this was  going to happen.  Larry!  Hello, boy.  Hi, Larry.  Have you ever played  Donkey Kong  on your avatar?  Let's go to  Larry King  on line two.  Larry!  How important  is getting  the quote right?  Apparently not  too much.  Don't I feel  like the asshole 
[00:07:30]  fucking?  What a dummy.  Yes.  I love that line  by Rhett Butler.  Frankly,  my dear,  I could care less.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  What was that one?  Here's touching you,  kid.  No, that's not it.  That's a great line  from another  great movie.  That's not the line,  Larry.  What?  That's not the line.  Go ahead,  make my breakfast. 
[00:08:00]  No, it's make my day.  Was that a,  oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to...  E.T.,  text your family.  No, that was a great one.  What?  Let's say hi to Larry King  on line one.  Larry!  Good morning,  gentlemen.  Hi, Larry.  Quick,  how important  is the memory?  Not very.  And he prefaces it 
[00:08:30]  by going,  that great line.  That great line  by Martin Brody,  I think  we'll need  a heftier vessel.  No, it's a bigger boat.  What?  Same thing.  My line's better.  Let's say hi to Larry King  on line two.  Larry!  Yes,  you remember  that famous line  from Mommy Dearest?  No more plastic hangers  ever.  No, that's not it either,  Larry.  What?  I thought that was it.  If you build it, 
[00:09:00]  someone's going to  show up eventually.  It's a great line.  Larry King  on Instant Feedback.  Luke,  I fathered you.  John G.  from Lexington.  to infinity  and then stop.  And Chris  from Sudbury,  Ontario,  the great Braveheart  quote,  gotta fight  to be free.  Frankly, 
[00:09:30]  I don't give a hoot.  A hoot.  Larry King  on line five.  Anthony Larry.  Larry.  Rich.  Hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  We got to stop the bit.  Rich.  This is our Larry King  segment.  We all talk  like Larry King.  Larry.  Even if you don't  do a good impression.  I'll do it.  I can do it.  I just did it.  Okay,  I'm not saying  I can do the  Larry King perfect.  So if you have  anything to say,  you have to talk  like this  for the next  10,  15 minutes.  Let's say  I don't like  Larry on line three.  Larry. 
[00:10:00]  I'm going to make  him an offer.  He might want  to say yes.  Elementary school,  my dear Watson.  Yeah,  don't come to Reno  and talk to  Moe Green  that way.  Get out.  Isn't that the quote?  Really?  Get out.  Just take a break.  It's like that,  but just close enough.  That was good?  No,  no,  no.  All right,  let's get back  into it.  I'm sorry.  I fucked up on that one.  All right,  Larry,  line four.  Say hi  to my tiny acquaintance.  Hello,  boys.  That was a great line.  I kind of liked it. 
[00:10:30]  Larry.  Good morning,  boys.  Good morning.  I don't think  we're in Menachie  anymore,  Toto.  I kind of like it.  I loved when  Jack Torrance  in The Shining  yelled,  here's Conan.  No,  that's...  That was a fantastic line.  Let's go to Larry  on line two.  Larry.  Yes,  how about that  great line  from The Terminator?  I'll be right there.  So frightening 
[00:11:00]  in Poltergeist  when she said  they're queer.  Let's say  hi to Larry.  Larry.  Yeah,  how about that  line from Pulp Fiction?  I'm pretty  motherfucking  far from coherence.  Thank you,  Larry.  Let's go to  line five.  Larry King's  on the line.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey,  boys.  Hi,  Larry.  Don't forget,  go get your  fucking shoebox.  Go get your  shoebox. 
[00:11:30]  How about  your favorite  line from  Planet of the Apes?  The only good  human is a good  human.  I don't have  a good line  for it.  I'm not good  at this.  He's just  a fucking...  It was a famous  line.  Am I supposed  to make it funny?  Actually,  yes.  Chris L.  from Jersey 
[00:12:00]  just writes,  James Bond  James.  That was a  tough one to  read.  Let me say  hi to Larry  on line two.  Larry King.  Well,  the great line  is,  I thought you  said,  I don't like  spiders.  when Johnny  Castle,  the great  Patrick Swayze  in Dirty  Dancing, 
[00:12:30]  said,  no one  puts a  corner in  baby.  A  coroner.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Larry,  you got a  great movie  quote.  Yeah.  Good morning,  boys.  Morning.  What we  have here  is a  failure  to  talk.  You're  some  clever  bastards.  Fucking  cloning  Larry.  Of course.  Go on,  Rich. 
[00:13:00]  No.  Jesus,  you can't  even come  close to  doing  Larry.  I'm  thinking  of  one.  Hold  on.  Hold  on.  Yeah.  I  think I  have  one.  This  is a  favorite  line.  All  right,  Larry.  Don't  look into  the star,  Carol Ann.  Delight.  Delight.  Don't  look into  the light  bulb,  Carol Ann. 
[00:13:30]  Oh,  fuck,  this sucks.  Yes,  stupid.  Holy  Jesus,  how come  my lines  and the  great line  from Sidney  Poitier,  they call  me Mr.  Don't  notice about  Rich.  I got to  go back  to regular  voice.  He can't  multitask.  He can  either do  the Larry  King voice,  but he  can't do  material as  he's in  the Larry  King voice.  It's  study. 
[00:14:00]  This is  my first  time.  Let's  go to  Larry.  Larry.  Line A.  Larry.  I love  the smell  of napalm  in the  morning.  Smells  like I'm  winning.  Let's  say hi  to Larry.  Larry.  The first  thing I'm  going to  do when  I get  home is  fuck  your  mama  in the  mouth.  And  who  could  forget  when 
[00:14:30]  Rocky  Balboa  was  standing  in the  ring  yelling,  yo,  Asian,  yo,  Asian.  Larry.  Yes,  hello,  gentlemen,  that famous  line from  when Harry  met Sally,  I'll also  eat what  she's  having.  That was  funny.  It's so  fucking  bad.  It's no  worse than  what he  did.  I know,  yeah.  Let me hear  that again.  Let's hear  Larry.  Yeah,  we're  going to  actually  hear  the  real  Larry 
[00:15:00]  last  night  on  his  own  show  quoting  movie  lines.  Well,  Stephen  Lang did  it on  Broadway,  and he  was  incredible  with that  great  line,  right?  You  wouldn't  know  the  truth.  You  can't  handle  the  truth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's  say hi  to  Larry.  Hi,  Larry.  Larry.  Larry, 
[00:15:30]  come on.  Larry,  you're  on.  Hi,  Larry.  Can  you hear  me?  Yes.  Oh,  hello,  gentlemen.  This is  Larry.  And who  could forget  that wonderful  line from  the  Godfather?  Leave  the gun,  take the  donuts.  How  about this  famous  line?  Yes.  No  more  wire  cables.  From  mommy  dearest.  No  more  wire  hangers.  That's  not  the  formula.  It's  so 
[00:16:00]  subtle,  it's  hard  to  describe.  Oh,  I get  it now.  That's  not  the  formula.  I  understand.  Basically,  the quote  means the  same.  It's  just  not the  famous  quote  anymore.  I  like  the  idea  of  that  famous  quote  from  Top  Gun,  Maverick  and  Goose.  I  feel  the  need,  the  need  for  a  gay  volleyball  game.  Now  we're  going  in  another  direction.  That's  all right.  Whatever. 
[00:16:30]  Larry.  Yeah,  he stinks  and I'm  not too  fond of  him.  From  Spider-Man.  And  who  could  forget  Jack  Dawson,  Leonardo  DiCaprio  and  Titanic.  I'm  the  king  of  this  boat.  Larry.  Larry.  Larry,  you're  on.  Yes,  Cleveland.  We have  a problem. 
[00:17:00]  Larry.  Who  can  forget  that  great  Charlton  Heston  line?  Don't  touch  me,  you  smelly  monkeys.  That's  what it  is.  After  Opie and  Anthony  live,  I'm Sam  Roberts.  And I  say it's  after Opie and  Anthony  live because  Opie and  Anthony aren't  here.  I say that to  all the people  who are  calling and  all the people  feedbacking in  trying to give  their Larry  King lines.  That was a  taped bit. 
[00:17:30]  Opie and  Anthony are not  here.  that happened  about a year  ago.  Not exactly  a year ago,  but about a  year ago.  The bit's  over and  it's still  coming in.  Yeah,  it's insane.  Erock,  I know we  talked to you  a minute ago  about the  hurricane  evacuation  plan,  the apocalypse,  of course.  And I don't  want to harp  on you,  but you did  have a rough  morning this  morning.  Yeah,  sure.  Opie did.  I mean,  maybe he was  taking anger  out on you.  I don't know.  I don't know  how you see  it, 
[00:18:00]  but he was  not happy  with your  performance  during the  first hour  of the show  today.  No,  for the  banjo stuff  with Eddie  Vedder and  Steve Martin.  Do you think  that he was  legitimate in  his criticisms  and concerns?  Stop.  From his  side,  I would say  yeah,  but I don't  need to explain  my side,  so I'll just  take the...  What do you  mean you don't  need to explain  your side?  It's not worth  it.  So I fucked  up,  it was my  fault,  and there it 
[00:18:30]  is.  You could  let him  talk.  No,  he's just  mumbling  and breathing  through his  nose.  But that's  Roland,  that's what  he does.  I talked  to Opie  about this,  Erock.  Of course  you did.  I wanted  to see  how your  progress was  throughout  the show.  Okay.  Here's  what he  had to  say.  All  right,  Opie,  so Erock  had a rough  start this  morning.  How did  he progress?  He had a  rough start  this morning?  I didn't  notice,  Sam.  Well,  you kind  of pointed  it out about  him sleeping  on the board  and the  Homer Simpson  thing. 
[00:19:00]  That's just  how I say  hello to  Erock every  morning.  So today  is just par  for the core  as far as  Erock goes?  I think that  he should  continue to get  in here at  553 for a  6 a.m.  start.  You think  whatever he's  doing now,  if it ain't  broke,  don't fix it.  I wouldn't  change anything  if I was  him.  Obviously,  no one is  noticing that he  might be a  little off on  his job.  All right,  thanks a lot.  You think  there was  sarcasm  there,  Erock?  I'm hoping  not.  Do you  think you're  off on  your job? 
[00:19:30]  I'll go  with yes  for this  morning.  And what  happened this  morning?  Why were  you off?  It doesn't  matter what  was going  on back  there.  It does.  What was  going on?  It sounds  like nitpicking  and it doesn't  really make sense  to the audience,  so I'm not  going to do  it.  Just tell  me.  It's just  me and you  talking.  No,  it's not.  What was  going on  that you  had to nitpick?  We were  looking for  the profit  system here  is not the  most organized  and speedy  system that  we have.  Profit,  of course,  is the audio  system. 
[00:20:00]  We used to  use Dilett,  and now  since coming  to Sirius,  the Sirius  is profit  and you  don't like  it.  We use  both,  but when  sometimes  there's  newer stuff,  newer music  from guests  that come  into Sirius  XM,  it's put  into the  profit  system  before it's  put into  the Dilett  system.  As was the  case,  I suppose,  for Steve  Martin.  Yeah,  and the  Eddie Vedder  song.  So we  were trying  to find  that.  It takes  a while  to search  for stuff  because they  don't give  us access  to everybody's  channels.  So you  have to do  a big  general 
[00:20:30]  search  throughout  the entire  profit  database.  So you're  blaming  the profit  system?  No,  for the  songs not  being put  up right  away?  Yes.  For me  misfiring  the Steve  Martin  song,  no.  So that  one was  operator  error?  That was  operator  error.  And no  excuse  for that  one?  I said  it was my  fault.  You are  the queen  of excuses,  Erock.  Now,  our pal  little  Jimmy  Norton  was on  the  Tonight  Show  last night.  And it  was a  big  appearance  for him.  He did  the spring  break  thing.  We played  a clip  of it  in the  show.  Again, 
[00:21:00]  listen to  the replay  if you  missed it.  It was  another  hilarious  performance  on Jay  Leonard's  Tonight  Show.  His new  CD is  out,  Despicable.  We played  tracks off  that a  couple weeks  ago here  on After  Opie and  Anthony  Live.  But today,  two years  ago today,  our old  friend Ted  stopped by.  And since  Jimmy wasn't  in today,  and he did  such a good  job on  The Tonight  Show,  I figured we  would honor  Ted by  playing this.  Two years  ago today,  Ted was a 
[00:21:30]  cake maker.  Right here on  After Opie and  Anthony Live.  After Opie and  Anthony Live.  Have you watched  the cake show?  Oh, yeah.  Ace of Cakes.  No, I've heard of it.  What is it called?  Ace of Cakes.  Yeah, Ace of Cakes.  Who's watching  that?  Ace of Cakes,  it's pretty  impressive.  It is.  They make the  cake into like  the Taj Mahal  or something.  I would like a  nice cake.  Who the fuck  do they do  that?  From Charm City  Cakes.  I saw one,  they made a  cake.  Wait, I don't  know, I swear  to God.  From where?  Charm City  Cakes.  Duff from  Charm City  Cakes, he  makes all  these cakes.  He made  one airplane 
[00:22:00]  cake, and  he stuck  like firecrackers  in the engine.  Did he throw  it into a  fucking cemetery  in Montana?  Get E-Rock  in here,  because he  just said  cake.  He goes,  cake, and  he goes,  I'll lunge  into the  DVDs.  You watch  this stupid  show?  You have  this on  DVD?  Of course  he does.  What?  It was a  special Target  exclusive.  Dude, I  wouldn't give a  shit if they  paid you to  take the  fucking DVDs  out of the  store.  Why would  you have  Ace of Cakes? 
[00:22:30]  Because it  was a Target  exclusive.  I got turned  on to the  show.  You'd sit  there.  Wait a minute,  wait a minute.  Let me paint  a picture.  You're sitting  there.  going like,  holy shit,  look what he's  doing with  that fucking  cake pan.  I gotta watch  that at least  20 times.  Yeah, I  got it on  DVD.  Rewind.  Rewind.  Watch the  icing.  Look, I'm  guilty for  taking a  peek, but I  wouldn't go  and get  the box set.  That's how I  started watching  the show.  Bored it on  DVD.  You just  saw it without  watching it? 
[00:23:00]  No, I  gotta check  this out.  Your DVD  collection must  just be  fantastic, but  you've got the  likes of Ace of  Cakes in it.  Ace of Cakes is  on every  day.  I never  saw it until  I was told to  buy the DVDs.  What's your  favorite cake?  I'm told to  buy the DVDs  now.  I know he's  told to buy  them.  Who told you?  My chick made  me do it.  His stomach  told him.  It wasn't my  chick.  What's your  favorite cake  that the guy  made?  They did one  for Leno.  They did a big  sports car cake.  See, he's  trying to bond 
[00:23:30]  with Jimmy  right there.  Yes, I am.  That was an  attempt to  watch it.  They're goofing  on.  All right, well,  you might know  a guy named  Leno, Jim.  Which one  sent you on  the fucking  biggest food  binge?  Which cake  sent you on  a binge?  One of them  did.  Which one?  No.  Sent you on  a sweet  binge?  Could you  find some of  these Ace of  Cakes, Travis?  I want to  hear a little  dialogue from  Ace of Cakes.  It's a good  show.  It's not a  good show.  Shut it.  They made a  cake and it  looks just  like a  sandwich.  Shut it. 
[00:24:00]  Let's fucking  eat it.  I'm sure  they're  delicious.  They are  probably the  most inedible  cakes.  It's like  plastic on  that fucking  cake that we  got at the  station.  Look at the  castle.  That one was  edible.  Look at the  enchanted  castle.  That's not a  cake.  It's a  sculpture.  That's in the  middle of a  train set.  That's a  cake.  You also  have to  realize what  makes it a  show is the  human drama  element of  you have to  make a  deadline.  You all  have to  work together  in Charm  City Cakes.  Charm City  Cakes.  Where is  Charm City  Cakes?  I think  it's in  St. 
[00:24:30]  Louis, but  I'm not  positive.  It's like  American  Chopper, but  for cakes.  Do they  ship them?  Oh, just  like it.  That's a  great way to  sell the  show.  American  Chopper with  cakes.  Do they  ship cakes?  They'll put  it in a  van.  They've  had to  put the  cake in  a van and  drive it  themselves, but  I don't  see how you  can pack it  up.  That gets  scary because  you don't know  if the cake is  going to make it  in one piece.  You don't know  if it's going to  fall down.  You hit one  speed bubble.  Oh, shit.  They just spent  an hour doing 
[00:25:00]  that cake.  And this is a  huge thing.  Cakes are very  tricky to ship.  Did you know  that, Samuel?  I had no idea.  Ted the cake  maker?  I had my  own cake  business, Gregory.  I make ice  cream cakes.  Oh, nice.  I ship them  all over the  country.  That must be  hard in the  refrigerated  trucks.  I know what?  I use UPS  ground.  You'll get  your cake  within five  days or it's  on old Ted.  Wow.  You must pay  for a lot of  cakes. 
[00:25:30]  I have, yes.  That's a good  point, Anthony.  I need to  change my  guarantee.  People are  always like,  there's just a  soupy cardboard  box.  My party's  ruined, Ted.  Ruined.  Nice.  It's a jerk.  Ronnie B hates  those cakes.  How would he  ship them?  Ronnie B says  he hates these  cakes because he  wants a cake  without Play-Doh  on top.  Yeah, that's  what it is.  It's too much  of that sculpting  stuff.  But it's edible. 
[00:26:00]  It's sugary.  Oh, it's  horrible tasting.  Flavored.  You know Duff  once made a  bumper car cake?  No.  And all the  cars were  little cakes.  That sounds  like a little  fun.  Wow, so  like.  That's  terrific.  The whole  cake was  the thing  that you  drive around  the bumper  cars and  each bumper  car gives  a fuck.  Those are  easy.  Do you know  I'll write  little inscriptions  on the  cakes.  Happy  birthday,  Merle.  Merle?  Yes, but  no one ever  sees it because 
[00:26:30]  they melt.  Yes.  Perhaps you  need a  refrigerated truck  again.  I don't  have that  kind of  money, Anthony.  UPS  ground, five  days or less  for it's  on old  Ted.  But see, you're  paying now  because you  gotta pay for  the cake that  gets there  melted, so  why don't you  just get  refrigerated  trucks?  Point taken.  Does the  ice cream cake  leak out of  the box?  Yes, it  does.  I've been  getting a lot  of complaints  that there's  just flat, 
[00:27:00]  soupy boxes  that aren't  delicious,  though.  They have  to say  that in  fairness.  Of course  they would.  Can't deny  the deliciousness  of Theodore's  cakes.  Yes, that's  what's called  Theodore's  Cake  Emporium.  Oh, it's an  emporium.  That's right.  Of course, it has  to be.  You think it,  I'll bake it.  That's my motto.  It's not a very  good one.  It doesn't rhyme.  I know it  doesn't.  I thought it  did.  I was tired.  Is there a  website?  Yes, it is.  It's Theodore's  Cake  Emporium with  thegoodguarantee.com. 
[00:27:30]  You've got to  work on your  website addresses  too.  I know, they're  too short.  They have to be  a lot longer  to roll off  the tongue.  At least you  got the .com.  Yes, I don't  know.  I meant to  say .org.  I know.  That's why  I went back  there.  That's why  I went back  there.  You're right.  .uk.  I have that  one too.  Lucky you.  After O&A,  live.  Yes, it is. 
[00:28:00]  After Opie and  Anthony Live,  I'm Sam Roberts.  That was Ted,  the cake maker,  in honor of  Jim Norton's  fabulous appearance  on The Tonight  Show last night.  That was two  years ago today.  Troy Kwan just  came in here  while that bit  was playing.  If you go on  his Twitter,  which is  Troy Kwan  with a Q-U,  some people  spell it K-W-A-N,  it's Troy Kwan  on Twitter,  you'll be able  to see pictures  of the house  that he was  talking about  his friend  building,  the Apocalypse  House,  and I still  don't see how  it would help,  but apparently  it's self-contained. 
[00:28:30]  Now,  Troy Kwan is also  working on  the Club Soda Kenny  version of  Rebecca Black's  song Friday.  Roland,  you just walked in.  Is there any chance  of us booking  Rebecca Black  on the show?  You nodded yes.  Yes.  There is.  What are the chances?  Good.  Really?  Is that legit?  I don't know.  Okay, you haven't  looked into it,  have you?  No.  Nobody asked,  but I will check  into it.  I'm sure she would 
[00:29:00]  because she's going  to do...  Whatever.  This is...  She has like 14  minutes.  Well, Club Soda Kenny  is doing Rebecca Black's  song.  Oh, that should  be hilarious.  You recorded it  yesterday.  I'm laughing right now.  Well, no, you're not  laughing.  You're breathing heavily  as usual.  What was that?  What was that?  What was that?  And Kenny,  it's very difficult  to work with.  I'm going to slap  you right now.  You're not being  E-Rock subconscious  anymore.  I'm going to turn  your mic off too.  How many people  are going to do it  today?  What?  Turn off your mic.  What mic?  Exactly. 
[00:29:30]  Now, Club Soda Kenny  is very difficult to work  with.  The Rebecca Black  song is in production  now, but he recorded  it yesterday, and this  is us sitting down  with Club Soda Kenny  trying to get him,  Roland, that one's not  on either, trying to  get him to behave  himself and record.  Isn't there a bad  vibe in this studio?  Why do you think  there's a bad vibe  in here?  You're just looking  for excuses.  Can't we go in the  closet?  No, we're doing it  in here. 
[00:30:00]  Troy, am I  difficult?  No.  I mean, you could be  a little bit easier  to work with.  Look how I'm  sitting.  Yeah?  Am I relaxed?  Yes!  All right, so I  start, yay, arc.  You want to hear it  first?  Yeah, no, just like  playing, I'll  pantomime.  Don't pantomime, we  need your voice.  Ready?  It's not funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  7 a.m., waking up in 
[00:30:30]  the morning, gotta be  fresh, gotta go  downstairs, gotta have  my bowl, gotta have  some cereal.  It's too fucking  fast.  Can't we slow it  down?  No!  You're singing  someone else's song.  I'll do my  rendition.  Well, we're not  slowing it down.  Well, can't we, like,  can't we record it 
[00:31:00]  slow and then speed  it up?  No.  This club story to  Kenny, he's impossible  to deal with, and he's  recording Friday by  Rebecca Black, the  latest YouTube  phenomenon.  We can't, we're not  going to play too many  clips, because I don't  want to give it away  before the final  product comes out, but  here's more of Kenny  trying to make changes  to this song.  Take it on, on,  everybody's rushing,  gotta get down by the  bus, stop!  Got my bus, I gotta  see my friends!  Can we redo that?  It was a little off.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Derek would be able  to fix it, can't you  fix it?  Just, just redo it.  Just redo it.  No, you're SoundCloud.  It doesn't even mean  anything.  I know.  No, Troy Kwan on  Facebook, you've got  a music page.  Just do the thing.  Ready?  Come on.  Wait, where am I  starting?  Same place, you gotta  do that again.  Gotta be fresh, gotta  go downstairs.  That's where we'll  cut that off, because  again, we don't want  to spoil it, the  Covino and Rich guys  are walking around 
[00:32:00]  out there.  I don't know what  they're doing.  Apparently they're on  at noon, I don't know  what they're doing  around here.  And one more from  Club Soda Kenny,  because we can't, we  can only give you a  taste today.  He's impossible to  record with.  It's very difficult.  Okay, so now we're  going to try this.  It goes, 745, we're  driving on the highway  cruising, so.  Can I change the time?  What time do you want  to say?  2.30?  No, you can't.  You cannot change the  time.  7.45, we're driving 
[00:32:30]  on the highway cruising.  Troy, you know what  time the child  goes to the dentist?  2.30.  That's right.  You said it already.  I don't know.  Okay.  Ready?  Here's how it goes.  This is Rebecca Black  verse 2.  Okay, let me tell you  how it goes.  She wants time to fly,  why don't she take a  plane?  Were you listening?  Like a G6.  I like that.  Ready? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  745, we're driving  on the highway, cruising  so fast I want time.  You'll be able to hear  all of that, probably  this Friday.  Did it just get darker  in here, Mark Zito?  I couldn't hear anything.  I heard a loud ting.  Yeah, what was that?  Nothing.  Nothing happened.  I don't know.  It seems darker in here  all of a sudden.  No, it's fine.  It's fine.  It's probably one of your  interns or something?  Yeah, they were carrying  a banner around and  seemed to have hit a light.  Oh, boy.  But I believe the light  is fine.  Mars is going to come in  here and yell at you  again like he did  yesterday.  No, everything is fine  in here. 
[00:33:30]  Everything is fine.  It's a little dark.  Is that banner  ripped over there?  No.  Okay.  No, but the top  popped off.  Oh, that's good.  The great Jim Florenti...  Uh-oh.  Where I move the lights?  There's an incident.  Where I move the lights?  You see?  Look at the table.  What?  Where?  This thing fell off a light.  Dude, yo, every day  you come in, you bust  something.  Look at you.  Our engineer, Mars.  What is wrong?  Thanks for the work,  though.  You keep me employed.  I appreciate it. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, Mark, you're just  trying to move a sign.  Uh, E-Rock, we had  another guest.  It wasn't just Stephen  laying in today.  It was also the great  Jim Florentine.  Yeah.  Uh, his new, uh, DVD  Meet the Creeps Volume 3  is out on his website  jimflorentine.com.  He made show history  not too long ago by  telling his creepy  wrestling pedophile story.  I liked it because I  like wrestling.  E-Rock, you liked it  because you're a  pedophile.  No, I like wrestling.  Really?  And you're a pedophile?  No, I'm not a pedophile. 
[00:34:30]  I would check into you.  This is Jim Florentine  and the creepy  wrestling pedophile  on After Opie and  Anthony Live.  After Opie and  Anthony Live.  What about when you  were a kid and you  wanted, uh, you used  to hang out with a guy  who had, like, uh,  you were into wrestling?  Oh, no.  Who was that?  Oh, no.  Who was that?  Please tell me that.  How old were you?  I was 14.  My dad used to take us  to wrestling matches  at Madison Square  Garden and we met  this guy out front  who would sell  wrestling pictures. 
[00:35:00]  Fat guy, 300 pounds,  a bad mustache.  We'd go up to him  every time he's in  the same, because he  was a photographer,  so he'd be in the  front, so he'd have  all these great  pictures, sell them  to us for a dollar  piece, you know, and  we became friends  with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give  me your address.  He started sending  us, picture all the  kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call  me on the phone and  tell me about the  match the night  before.  Oh.  And my voice was  about this, it was  this deep at 14, he's  on the other end and  I'm asking all these 
[00:35:30]  questions and he's  fucking breathing heavy.  Oh, no.  I had no idea.  I'm thinking, where  is this, this guy  just came in from a  jog?  Where fucking, where  is this fat guy  jogging from?  He's keeping me on  the phone.  Don't you want to  know more about the  match?  Well, ask me some  questions.  And he's fucking, I  had no idea.  Wow.  So then we went to  a match by ourselves.  Our parents let us  take the train at  Asbury Park or  whatever.  So we're sitting in  nosebleed seats.  He comes up in  between a match and  he goes, hey, I got  two seats right in the  front because he was  the photographer. 
[00:36:00]  Somebody wants to  come down to Jim, you  and this other guy,  this other kid with  blonde hair and blue  eyes.  Come on down.  We get down there.  There's only one  seat.  Oh.  We go, what's  going on?  He goes, oh,  somebody's going to  have to sit on my  lap.  This is my other  seat.  I'm like, you didn't  say that.  He's like, well,  and I'm like, this is  bullshit.  I'm ready to walk up  there and all of a  and he was holding  me like I was on a  motorcycle, like he  was on the back.  Are you shitting me? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah, his arms.  Yeah, I was.  I knew I wasn't going  to fall.  But you got to see  Andre the Giant.  Right, first row.  He's justifying it.  What are you?  First row.  Yeah, come on.  It was first row.  But then halfway through  the match, all of a  sudden, I feel a nibble  on my ear.  No.  I swear to God, I go,  what the fuck?  He goes, I was just,  I was looking that way.  It was an accident.  I'm like, that's  bullshit.  I'm like, no, I'm  fucked this.  I go, Mike, you get  on his lap.  It's your turn.  He didn't even know  what happened.  I didn't care.  I fucking threw him  under the bus.  On top of it, actually. 
[00:37:00]  I just look over at  one point, he was  holding him like that.  He was younger than  me.  He was like real cute,  like a 12-year-old.  He was holding him  like, I don't know  what's going on over  there, but fucking  look at Andre.  He just fucking  body slammed Bruno  Sammartino.  Wouldn't he want  for the wrestling  pictures?  He was going to  give you a wrestling  picture?  Well, then he,  then he,  the next time I see  him.  Right?  Yeah.  Then he would say,  he'd see me, he goes,  hey, you know, we  haven't seen each  other.  Why?  Because you like  this picture?  I'm like, yeah.  He's like, you want  it for free?  I'm like, sure.  And he's like, all 
[00:37:30]  well, give me a kiss  on the cheek.  And I'm like, why?  He's like, oh,  Italian men do that  all the time when  they greet each  other.  My dad did it with  his friend.  I'm like, it makes  sense.  You know, do these  guys have like a book  or do they come up  with a sort of like  chapter four, the  lap trick?  Yeah, yeah.  The one seat at the  wrestling mask.  The one seat, yeah,  this is a tried and  true trick.  And if they catch  you, if they don't  like you nibbling on  their ears, say you  were looking around  their head to try to  find something.  Always try to stay  out of trouble.  But the ball is to 
[00:38:00]  do that in front of a  full arena.  I know, right?  You've got to love  this guy.  Yeah.  And you know, cut to  a quick story.  When I told this story  one other time, this  guy called me up or  emailed me and said  it was the same, was  it this guy, Barry,  whatever, I'm like,  yeah.  He said that his  family, he lived in  North Jersey, right?  Same thing, he was  working this kid, right?  His parents dropped  him off at his New  York City apartment at  12 years old because  Barry said he was  going to take him to  a wrestling match the  next day.  Oh, no.  Shit.  And his parents  dropped him off to  stay the night, the  Friday night, for the 
[00:38:30]  Saturday match.  A 12-year-old kid.  Oh, the poor little  kid.  Oh, I think you're  saying Lucky Barry.  So he's all over  him, he's grabbing him  this and that, and the  kid starts crying, he's  like, no, and he's  fending him off, and  in the morning he  goes, get dressed.  He's like, what do  you mean?  He goes, the match  got canceled.  Jeez.  And his parents had  to come and pick him  up because the match  got canceled.  Did it really get  canceled?  No, there was no  fucking match, but  the kid was fending  him off the whole  night.  That's it.  It's after Opie and  Anthony live.  That was Jim Florentine 
[00:39:00]  who was in studio  talking about  his days of  dealing with a  pedophile for  wrestling tickets.  Now, I might be  willing to not go all  the way with a  pedophile, but I  mean, he did sit in  the front row to see  Andre the Giant.  What would you do?  Suck his dick?  I wouldn't go that  far, no.  The great Ron  Bennington has  entered the studio.  So you were a big  Andre the Giant fan?  Well, I mean, as  far as, I wasn't  around when he was.  I will tell you  this, I was  backstage once.  Andre the Giant  was back in the 
[00:39:30]  soccer room and  playing cards totally  naked.  Really?  Yeah.  Totally naked.  Because was anybody  else naked?  No.  Just because he  could.  Yeah, and the thing  is, it was before the  matches, so I mean, you  have an extra two  seconds to put on  trunks.  It wasn't like, oh, I'm  sweaty.  I need, he was just  sitting back there  naked.  And he was playing with  someone?  Yeah, there was a  person sitting across  from him and he was  dealing and it was  one of those, it was 
[00:40:00]  almost like if you've  ever accidentally walked  in on your grandmother  changing.  You know what I mean?  It was just horrifying.  But I guess all the  guys back there knew  well enough that they  weren't going to tell  Andre to put clothes on.  Well, you know, I mean,  I don't have to tell you  there's a homoerotic  thing to that.  Do you think that's  what it is?  Oh, man.  No one judges.  No one judges.  I thought it was just a  respect thing.  You know, with Elizabeth  Taylor dying today, I  think we need to be open to  everything that happened  in the 80s.  Did you hear that Ant  made a joke about Liz  Taylor getting punched  in the face while the  guy from Avatar was in 
[00:40:30]  here?  No.  Yeah.  Stephen Lane brings up  Liz Taylor dying and it  took Ant all of 45 seconds  to bring up Richard Burton  punching her about the  eyes.  I also, Ron, you brought  up something yesterday  on After Open Anthony  Live.  So, by the way, Stephen  Lane was pushing the  white, what do you  call it, drinkers?  Yeah, the Irish.  Drinkers.  He's actually unbelievable  in that.  He's great.  We have none of us.  So, you got to see it  because you prepped your  interview.  Yeah, I prepped my  interview.  That's kind of crazy?  Yeah.  All right, good.  As a matter of fact, a 
[00:41:00]  half hour before Stephen  Lane came in, Opie said,  yeah, and coming up later,  Stephen Lane on the show.  Who's Stephen Lane?  We had to remind him,  Avatar guy.  Oh, okay.  He's great.  Yeah.  But yesterday on this  show, after ONA Live,  you said I was a male  flirter.  Yeah.  I talked to my dad  yesterday.  Right.  And he said, you know  what Ron was saying?  You know that's true.  Really?  Yeah.  So, okay.  I'm going to have to  start doing a little  more self-analyzing, I  think.  Why are you looking at 
[00:41:30]  me that way?  Why are you looking in  your eyes?  I don't mean it.  I'm just trying to  have a conversation.  It's very uncomfortable.  Just trying to have a  conversation.  So, your dad listens to  this show?  Yeah, he listens to  Opie and Anthony and  then the 10 o'clock  hour.  Well, thanks for  sticking with me.  But that's strange.  Actually, a couple  of times when I told  him that I had been  mentioned on your  show in the beginning  once or twice.  You tune in to see if  you talk about me.  As long as he can  hear his son.  Yeah, but then  I'll turn off.  Yeah, I get it. 
[00:42:00]  And he gets bummed  out when he finds out  that I was on at the  end of Rana Fez because  he knows the replay  isn't until late at  night.  He has a lot of  free time, your dad,  huh?  He's a retired man.  Yeah, but still, a  lot of guys pick up a  hobby, do charity work.  No, he sits home  walking the dogs.  Yeah.  We got to let you  go.  No stretching today  because you have a  guest coming up, but  you're going to want  to stay tuned.  Trust me, don't worry  about what Ron is  saying.  Trust me, you're  going to want to  stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is  coming up next.  This has been  After Opie and  Anthony Live. 
[00:42:30]  The Opie and  Anthony show is now  over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A  show on Facebook at  Facebook.com slash  Opie and Anthony  and catch Opie and  Anthony live Monday  through Friday from  6 to 10 a.m.  Easter.  Ron and Fez are  next on the  virus. </pre>
