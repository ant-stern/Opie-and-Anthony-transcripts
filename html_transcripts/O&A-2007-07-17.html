<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts self-aggrandizingly describing themselves as "radio shock jocks" and engaging in banter about a strip search.  This segued into the usual Tuesday segments: "Rock Scream Tuesday," featuring listeners' loud screams; "Hummer Tuesday," encouraging listeners to perform oral sex and report back; and "Far Away Phone Calls Tuesday," attempting to connect with geographically distant callers (one caller from Dublin was revealed to be a liar).  Throughout the show, the hosts heavily promoted their "O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour," emphasizing the low ticket price of $10 and offering special deals for military personnel.

A significant portion of the show was dominated by Anthony's extended, offensive fantasy of becoming a dictator-like leader of the United States.  His plan involved consolidating power, withdrawing troops, forcefully seizing Venezuelan oil, creating a new currency ("Kumias"), and appointing himself and others to cabinet positions including "Minister of Comedy" and "Minister of Communications." His vision was of a strong, isolationist America without political parties, expressed using explicit and violent language.  Listeners participated in the segments, with one submitting a "Hail Kumia rock scream." The hosts also discussed listener emails and the specifics of Anthony's proposed government, including the Kumias currency design and cabinet member roles.

The show also covered a range of other topics.  A listener email sparked a discussion about political scapegoats and the proposed appointment of Don Imus as "Minister of Language." The hosts jokingly suggested opening "rubber dog duty plants" in Flint, Michigan. They declared "Diabolical Laugh Tuesday" as an official segment and, following a listener’s "diabolical laugh,"  discussed the viral "Obama Girl" video, speculating on its creators' intentions, and playing the song itself.  This led to discussions of Amber Lee Ettinger's attractiveness, comparisons to other women, and speculation about lip-syncing.  The hosts also touched upon the "Obama Girl vs. Giuliani Girl" video and the song "Hot for Hill,"  interspersing these discussions with a critique of soccer.  Sam, a show staffer, joined the show in studio briefly to discuss his dinner.  The hosts also promoted Jimmy Norton's book signing throughout the show.

The death of NYPD officer Russell Timoshenko was discussed, focusing on the parents' anger, the lack of the death penalty in New York, criticism of Reverend Al Sharpton's response and his criticisms of Elizabeth Hasselbeck and TMZ's use of "RoboHo." A song about Reverend Al Sharpton was played, and the hosts discussed racial disparities in media coverage of crime. A listener called in to share a personal connection to Officer Timoshenko.

The show featured a discussion of a video on their website showing Gina Lynn and Jill Nicolini engaging in playful physical contact.  This was followed by phone calls, including Harry from Buffalo’s “diabolical laugh”, and a call from Dave in the NYPD discussing cop killer prosecutions and policing complexities.  The conversation shifted to Ralph Papito, a Roger Williams University board chairman who used the n-word at a meeting.  Numerous calls from Buffalo, exceeding previous records, were taken.  The hosts discussed a fight between John Lovitz and Andy Dick, fueled by Dick’s alleged role in events leading to Phil Hartman's death, detailing Andy Dick’s erratic behavior and substance abuse.  Further calls, including one from Albany about an encounter with intoxicated little people, and one from Australia, followed. The discussion extended to the c-word, mirroring the earlier discussion about the n-word. A song parody, "My Dick's All Shitty," was played. A segment with street interviews about burying the c-word was teased.  The possibility of an Opie and Anthony takeover of "The Man Show" was also discussed.

A segment focused on listener complaints about ticket prices (resolved by giving free tickets to Chris S. in Detroit), leading to another discussion about offensive language, particularly the c-word versus "dick," with on-air interviews of women to gauge reactions.  A large portion centered on intern "Cream Pie Jones," whose nickname’s origin was explained,  and a staged, escalating, and highly offensive stunt competition with "Eastside Dave" from the Ron and Fez show, involving increasingly outrageous and graphically described acts culminating in the consumption of feces.  The segment ended with plans to further develop Cream Pie Jones’s "character" for future stunts.

The final segment detailed the continuation of the Cream Pie Jones/Eastside Dave stunt competition, highlighting Eastside Dave’s prior shocking stunt of defecating, finger-fingering it, and partially consuming it.  The hosts, along with the crew, debated increasingly outrageous ways Cream Pie Jones could top this, even considering Pat Duffy as a replacement.  Ideas like drinking urine, a "shit scavenger hunt" using a baby pool filled with feces, and "duty darts" were discussed. Pat Duffy himself briefly called in to offer suggestions.  The segment concluded with excited planning for a Central Park "diarrhea super soaker" attack, requiring the hosts to consume diarrhea-inducing foods, punctuated by repeated chants of "montage."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Any other medium has to be nice.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Harris, you were strip searched.  Was the search something we like to call the old two-hander?  Whoa, man.  Did they do the old grip and rip?  This is where Hayman is going.  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Opie is with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Ah, there it is.  There it is.  Thank God we're always ready to stand in for that music.  Oh, yeah.  And it fools everybody because they say, I couldn't even tell. 
[00:01:30]  We like the music to kind of like do a little build before we start talking.  Yes.  It makes it that much more dramatic for everybody.  It's got to be a dramatic show opening because it's such an important program.  That makes me giggle.  I know.  You get the ecstasy of gold, which, of course, is one of the songs from the good, the bad,  the ugly.  Yes.  That email comes in all the time on Instant Feedback.  Where's that song from?  The good, the bad, the ugly.  You want to tell them it's from a gay porno so they go out and rent it? 
[00:02:00]  Hey.  As the final credits are rolling, you're like, wait, where's the song?  I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but where's the song?  I rented this for the song.  And then we do the Rage Against the Machine, their version of Street Fighting Man.  It's all dramatic.  Very dramatic.  And then you think about what you did on the last show, and you kind of have to laugh to  yourself.  Wow.  Duty Hat?  Duty Hat.  Yes.  Yeah, what happened?  It doesn't quite fit that dramatic music.  No, no.  No, it doesn't. 
[00:02:30]  Playing Benny Hill music.  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Huh?  Huh?  What?  Oh.  How dare we talk about crap when it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  Here it goes.  Here it goes.  Kick it into high gear.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:03:00]  Rock Scream.  I want to apologize to anybody whose clock radio went off during that.  All right.  Now we can officially start the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Oh, wait a minute.  God, is that annoying. 
[00:03:30]  I love how the turns into, right when it switches, that scream.  Well, no, we could do.  God, this is way too early to be this obnoxious.  Oh, is it?  I apologize to everyone that has woken up to this crap.  We like to wake up.  That's like when you slam the snooze alarm and yell the F word.  Yeah.  Like, what are they doing?  This is the original Rock Scream that started the phenomenon.  Yes.  There you go. 
[00:04:00]  See, that guy's got a lot of echo on there, too.  He's cheating.  Wow.  He's got a good Rock Scream.  We haven't heard your Rock Scream yet.  I want echo.  I want to warm up.  I can't do it this early in the morning, either.  I did a Rock Scream.  It's been buried by the staff, and I don't blame them, but I did do one.  I need hot water and honey.  Prima Donna.  Hold on a minute.  It's also a... 
[00:04:30]  It's Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  God, I forgot about that.  With this Hummer Tuesday promo.  There's enough girls walking the hallways where we can have a girl going, mm, mm, mm, making that sound.  Yeah, that chick that works on sales, that was pretty open about her sexuality.  I'm sure she would help us out with the Hummer Tuesday promo.  Oh, Pat's chick?  Yeah, Pat's chick.  Maybe she could get involved with the Hummer Tuesday sweeper. 
[00:05:00]  Of course, this is a real thing, ladies.  Yes.  We're looking for you to give Hummers today.  It's wonderful.  It's a thing.  I mean, a lot of couples, maybe, they've been together a while.  They've kind of fallen out of sorts with that kind of thing, with that kind of intimacy.  And it's a good way to break the ice to get back into it.  Because everyone loves it.  Yeah.  Come on, and guys, reciprocate, you know?  Spin yourselves around into that wacky position. 
[00:05:30]  Have a grand old time.  Isn't that good?  Isn't that great, that position, where you can know where your nose is?  Absolutely.  Hello.  How do you do?  Oh, yes, by the way, if you give a Hummer today, ladies, just say that's for Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Because you're a fan of their show.  This is what I do for you.  Okay?  Wunderbar.  So we got Hummer Tuesday.  We'll take some phone calls as far as that goes.  Oh, well, also, let's not forget, it's also. 
[00:06:00]  It's far away.  Phone call.  Tuesday.  Look.  I'm tired of even commenting on it.  So far, we got a phone call coming from Providence.  Oh, that's real far away.  We're on a station in Providence, so that's not really going to help us.  And then we got a phone call from Indiana so far, so we're trying to get a little further  away than that.  Tuesday has really become the day.  That is the day. 
[00:06:30]  Because it has sweepers and everything.  It's, yeah, that's the day.  That's a strong day.  That's like the old Thursday night on NBC day.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what our Tuesday is.  Yeah.  It's must listen Tuesday.  Hey, must listen Tuesday.  Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's also.  It's your door is a jar Tuesday.  All right.  Look.  Anthony show.  No.  That one doesn't even make sense.  Well, we have a sweeper.  We have to go with it. 
[00:07:00]  That one makes no sense.  Hey, man.  Sweeper equals you have to do it.  But what does it mean?  If you're even getting out of your car, your door is a jar.  Yeah, but see.  Are you suggesting people call in with their door a jar?  Look.  And we hear the little chime.  A lot of people getting their day started, listening to us, and they got little chores  to do.  They're running into like a, I don't know, like a wah-wah.  Wah-wah.  Or Dunkin' Donuts or a Starbucks to get their morning coffee.  Uh-huh.  And their jar. 
[00:07:30]  Their jar.  Their car door may be a jar.  May be a jar.  Yes.  Is Kentucky far away enough for a far away phone call?  Not for people in Kentucky.  I mean, we're looking for people that are probably listening on the internet for the  far away phone calls.  All right, dude.  Because, you know, whether you're listening to terrestrial radio or satellite radio, if  you're in that coverage zone, you're not really far away, are you? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  But, um, we're looking for people like, hi, it's tomorrow where I am.  And I know the lottery numbers.  Yeah.  That's a good, or it's yesterday where I am, or something.  Do you play the horsies?  Well, I'm from tomorrow.  I can tell you what horsey came in.  Ooh.  Win, place, and show, baby.  I'd be out of here so quick.  No kidding.  Down to an OTB.  All right, here's my rock scream.  Jimmy hasn't done a rock scream yet.  Anthony hasn't done a rock scream yet. 
[00:08:30]  This is my rock scream.  I have to get all worked up for it.  I'm proud of this one, even though they buried it.  I can't listen to that.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Why does yours sound like a plane crash? 
[00:09:00]  Hey, man.  Completely with, like, propeller failure and screaming on impact.  No critiquing on Rock Scream Tuesday.  I'm not critiquing.  New rule.  New rule.  I won't critique.  All rock screams are welcome.  All rock screams are welcome on Rock Scream Tuesday.  No critiquing.  It's like a Statue of Liberty for bad sounds.  California.  Far away phone call?  Well.  No.  Well, are the rules far away from us, or far away from everyone listening? 
[00:09:30]  It shouldn't be far away from everyone listening.  It really should be.  I think we're still being heard in San Francisco on a tiny, tiny little AM in the middle of nowhere.  I think some AM that transmits from Alcatraz.  That's what we're down to in San Francisco.  Thanks for the support in San Francisco.  All right.  Here's a real one, though.  Opie's.  See, people are criticizing.  You can't criticize on Rock Scream Tuesday.  Well, if you were to criticize, someone says Opie's Rock Scream sounds like a prison rape. 
[00:10:00]  Someone also suggesting your Rock Scream sounds like someone falling towards the earth.  Well, what can I tell you?  Your Rock Scream was better yesterday when you were squeezing one out.  You know, that squeeze out from yesterday caused a major headache today.  That's not a good sign.  A major headache.  It could have been, like, some kind of aneurysm. 
[00:10:30]  Well, I stopped breathing, and I pushed so hard, I almost passed out.  Did you pop a vein?  I forgot to tell you that.  Yesterday, I almost passed out.  Getting ready to, you know, get the duty hat together.  Yeah.  We can't even explain the duty hat over here.  Sorry.  No, it was good.  That was fun.  It is what you think it is.  Yeah.  Ending with Than just, uh...  It's just two simple words.  Duty hat.  That's right.  And then Than just smacking the top of the hat.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Wonderful.  Let's just keep it like that.  Uh, Steve in Boston, what's going on?  Not much.  Going down the highway with my seatbelt off.  I would suggest his door was ajar.  He said his seatbelt is off.  Oh.  It's not seatbelt off Tuesday.  Steve, what are you getting at?  Is your door ajar?  Yes, it could be.  Dumb. 
[00:11:30]  Dumb.  Okay.  All right.  Finally, a faraway phone call.  From where?  Oh, okay.  We'll take that in a second.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie!  Opie, Anthony, Jimmy.  What's up, boys?  What's up, Charlie?  Hi, Charlie.  Hey, I'd like to give a rock scream for Rock Scream Tuesday.  All right.  Let's go, Charlie.  That's an e-rock scream.  Hey, Jimmy?  Jimmy?  It'll never work.  Frr, frr, frr. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Meow.  It's a purring frunkus.  That makes combinations of everything.  Yeah.  All right.  You know what?  I like him.  E-rock scream Tuesday, that guy did.  We're taking Cat Noise Wednesday off the schedule.  Yeah, people are abusing it.  Yeah, they're abusing it.  As soon as they start abusing one of these, then we have to take it away from everybody.  Trevor, Dublin.  From Dublin.  You're really calling from Dublin?  Yeah, I'm visiting my family over here.  Oh, so you're not Irish. 
[00:12:30]  Well.  I am Irish.  But you're not.  You're from Ireland.  No, I actually was born there when I was five and came here when I was six.  That's okay.  There's no need.  It doesn't matter where you're from.  It's where you are.  And you're in Dublin.  Listening to us?  Oh, yeah.  On the old internet?  Nope.  On the satellite radio.  I brought it along.  Oh, boy.  Now you're a liar.  See, satellite radio doesn't go to Europe.  It doesn't go over there, sir, so you're lying. 
[00:13:00]  You're lying to us.  So now...  Mess up.  Now admit you're lying to us.  Admit it.  Prove that I'm lying.  Because the satellite coverage is only over the United States, parts of Canada, and parts  of the South.  Maybe a little piece of Mexico and stuff, but it covers the United States.  Yeah, we get into Mexico a little bit.  Because we heard from that Mexican dentist, remember?  But, sir, there is no satellite over Dublin.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  See, the satellite...  Huh?  I said it works over here, so...  No, it doesn't.  Just admit you're lying, sir, please.  We know technology-wise it can't work.  Yeah.  Why are you continuing to lie to us?  The satellite is over.  It's in an orbit that stays over the United States.  How could it transmit to you, sir?  By the time I explain it to you, the show will be over.  No, try.  Go ahead.  Because satellites go around in orbit, and, you know... 
[00:14:00]  Did you...  A lot of orbit.  Did you ever hear of a synchronous orbit?  ...travitational pole on...  It's...  The orbit of the satellite is spinning the same speed of the Earth, and it stays in the  same spot over the Earth.  It never goes over Dublin.  So how are you hearing us?  You have to admit you're lying before we let you go.  I'm Irish.  I'm stubborn, so...  Where are you...  Where are you calling from in Jersey?  I'm from Jersey.  Hell no.  Okay.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Really from Queens, but I'm really in Dublin. 
[00:14:30]  No, you're not.  You can't be in Dublin if you're telling us you're listening to us on the satellite.  Dude, it's not Liar Friday.  What Liar Friday?  Come on.  How's the weather over there?  Geosynchronous orbit.  What time is it?  It's about 1 o'clock.  Sorry.  1 o'clock...  It's due.  ...in the morning?  Afternoon.  1 o'clock in the afternoon.  Wait, 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  So there...  Pull out that iPhone.  Ah, well, we got iPhones. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Let's see.  We got iPhones.  We'll figure this out.  1 in the afternoon.  Huh?  Would it be...  1 what?  1 what?  1.18.  1.18.  Oh, that means we got to take a break.  No.  Now you're done for.  It's incorrect.  Oh, my God.  It's like 11.15.  Yes.  My iPhone's telling me it's 11.15.  Dude, it's 11.15 in Dublin.  Can you please admit you're lying? 
[00:15:30]  Just say you're lying and you're in the United States.  Do I win a prize if I admit that lie?  Yes.  Yes.  We got the Alec Baldwin best of SNL.  Yes.  I admit I'm lying without a lot of things.  Where are you?  I'm in the house.  I hate you.  Dude, I'm hanging up on you.  Come on.  Admit you're lying and then you get the Alec Baldwin best of SNL. 
[00:16:00]  Admit I'm lying.  All right.  Where are you calling from, really?  Where are you calling from?  My girlfriend's house in Pennsylvania.  Oh, yay.  Dublin.  All right.  There goes Trevor.  You'll get nothing.  Give me the Alec Baldwin best of SNL.  What the hell?  As a punishment.  Let's take a call from Providence.  Steve, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello.  I was just calling, actually, hoping to compete for the Alec Baldwin DVD.  Maybe if you have a second one. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, we might just have it.  No, we're finally out of the Alec Baldwin best of SNL.  We have given away our second of two of those items.  Those things went like hotcakes.  They sure did, Anthony.  Maybe we can give you something else.  There you go.  I was actually hoping maybe I could try a little rock scream if I could.  Oh, man.  How about the best of Phil Hartman?  Uh-oh.  He's no Baldwin, but he'll do just fine.  All right.  We'll give you the Saturday Night Live, the best of Phil Hartman.  Go ahead, Steve. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Here's my rock scream.  This one's for you, Jimmy.  Meow.  Atta boy.  Oh.  I don't want to waste.  No.  You're wasting.  You're wasting them.  We need rock screams.  It's rock screams.  Hey, by the way, it's also $10 ticket Tuesday.  This is really going on.  We want to say good morning to everybody listening in Boston, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Jersey,  and, of course, Philly.  All day long today, starting at 9 a.m., $10 tickets for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. 
[00:17:30]  Nice to see Boston jump to board on that.  They absolutely did.  And Boston's also running that special.  If you've got a military ID, you get in free this Saturday in Mansfield.  All the info for the comedy tour is on Virus Tour, one word on MySpace.  But it's eight or nine comedians you know and love from the show.  We've got videos.  We've got tailgating.  We've got the O&A Village.  Expect to spend at least five to six hours.  It's an all-day thing.  Even the Coast Guard? 
[00:18:00]  Even the Coast Guard, yes.  Okay.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Don't forget, $10 tickets all day long today through Ticketmaster for Boston, Detroit,  Washington, D.C., Jersey, and Philly.  All right?  Bravo.  All right.  A quick break.  And I've got to bring up what you were talking about in the office after the break.  Oh.  My solution.  Anthony has figured out everyone's problems.  I figured out the world's problems.  No.  Actually.  No, you figured out the United States of America's problems. 
[00:18:30]  The United States' problems.  Problems, right.  God, if I could.  He's got a solution.  Yeah.  That includes brand new money.  Well, it could.  Somebody else brought that up.  I never brought that up.  But I kind of like the idea.  But you didn't say, no, no, no.  That's going a little too far.  It fits with my theory.  Anthony wants to rule America.  Well, not with an iron fist.  We'll get into it.  For our people.  We'll get into it next.  We will.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Bill from Nassau County.  He writes on the instant feedback.  I finally became a member of Hummer Tuesday last week.  And then my chick dumps me Sunday.  Aw.  At least I'm a member.  Bring back FU Friday.  We brought back FU Friday.  We got the FU line and all that happening, right?  Yes.  Our phone number.  We don't have to give out the phone number on Rock Scream Tuesday for some reason.  877-212-5762.  Write that number down. 
[00:19:30]  You're going to need it eventually.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Georgia.  Kevin, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  I called in for the trifecta.  I live in the middle of frickin' nowhere.  And my car seems to be binging a little bit.  And...  There you go.  Wow.  A far away, door ajar Rock Scream. 
[00:20:00]  Boy, did that guy go all out.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Indiana.  Floyd, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm calling in for Rock Scream today.  Rock, rock, rock, rock.  Rock, rock, rock.  What do you got?  Meow.  Yeah, see?  You're going to wreck it for everybody.  The cat...  You're going to wreck it for everybody.  ...has got to go.  You're wrecking it for everybody.  By the way, Tim just ran in with a brand new Hummer Tuesday sweeper.  Oh, thank God. 
[00:20:30]  That last one had to go.  It's just sloppy sounds and then some voice going,  Thanks, Tim.  I want to play the original again.  Hold on.  Oh, of course.  Let's see the difference between the two.  You got to compare the two, right?  This is Tim's first try at the Hummer Tuesday sweeper.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  It's like getting one from Krusty.  That's, you know... 
[00:21:00]  Another one of these.  That isn't white face paint.  I didn't know you could do Krusty.  Everyone does a little Krusty.  Here's the brand new Hummer Tuesday sweeper.  It's Hummer Tuesday. 
[00:21:30]  Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Humming is great.  I love hummers.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  See, that conjures up a much better image.  I like that.  You really?  Yeah.  I kind of like the Krusty one.  Yeah.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  All right. 
[00:22:00]  Well, add that to the sweepers.  Keep the original Hummer Tuesday sweeper, though.  I think people enjoy that one in some sick way.  That was...  That other...  The second one there was sexy.  Yeah.  Sexy.  Hey, don't forget, it's also a $10 ticket Tuesday.  This is real.  This is happening.  Want to say hi to Boston, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Jersey, and of course, Philly once again  this morning.  You got $10 lawn tickets going on sale at 9 a.m. for our O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show  through Ticketmaster. 
[00:22:30]  And these tickets will be on sale all day long.  And Boston was added to this.  They weren't doing the $10 ticket special overnight.  They decided to go for it as well.  Okay, good.  And Boston also running that military ID special.  If you got a military ID, you get in for free this Saturday when we take the tour to  Mansfield.  Also, dancers for the Virus Show in Mansfield provided by Centerfolds Oxford.  They're sending eight dancers for us, so thank you to that.  And of course, oh my God, the tour is brought to you by Bud Light. 
[00:23:00]  Always worth it.  Oh my God.  Stan is just handing me plugs left and right here.  But the most important thing, 9 a.m. this morning, you can get a ticket for our comedy  show.  $10.  That's insane.  It really is insane.  Boston, Detroit, D.C., and PNC and Homedale.  It's a five-hour show if you count the O&A Village and the tailgating.  And then like what we do after the show.  Oh, and Philly.  Yeah, and Philly.  Well, Philly, we're doing something very special.  The $10 tickets will be for the rest of the week if you're trying to get tickets for 
[00:23:30]  the Camden show.  That's very confusing.  It really is.  That's why you should go to VirusTour, one word on MySpace to get all the info.  But basically, $10 tickets going on sale today at 9 a.m., okay?  Can't go to our website?  We didn't work that out yet with the lawyers?  No, I don't know.  I don't know where we're at with that.  Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Anthony wants to be the next Fuhrer.  Let's just be honest here.  Well, not a Fuhrer.  Let's just be honest.  But the government, the way it is, very divided.  The American people, very divided. 
[00:24:00]  Our troops are spread so thin everywhere.  Before you go into a rant, and I apologize because usually I interrupt you in the middle  and it sucks, but I got you early on this one.  Oh, yes, yes.  Trying to be a little more considerate with that stuff, but we do jump all over the place.  Denise is calling from Buffalo, listening on the edge.  Denise.  Yes.  Explain yourself.  I see what you want to say on the comments, but tell Anthony and Jimmy here.  Well, I think, well, what I'm trying to say is I offered my boyfriend Hummer Tuesday,  and he turned it down for an Fu. 
[00:24:30]  Wait.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Wait.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Well, it's his loss because I got laid, and he missed out on a Hummer.  Wait a minute.  You, your boyfriend said no to a Hummer?  He did.  From you?  Yep.  But you got action anyway from him?  Yep.  So why doesn't he want you to give him a Hummer?  Yeah, he don't like those things?  Well, first of all, I think he's nuts.  Second of all, he wanted to share, he says. 
[00:25:00]  What do you mean he wants to share?  He didn't want me to go without.  Oh, yeah, but there's a whole, you know, thing you could do.  You know, you do that, he does what he does, and then you both do what you do together,  and then there's a whole, you know, thing.  I understand that.  He just doesn't like Hummers from you, I guess, huh?  Maybe you're really bad at it.  No, no, no.  That's one thing he does enjoy.  Wait, if he enjoys Hummers, then why is he saying no to a Hummer? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, she's confusing.  Guys that love Hummers will never say no to a Hummer.  Wow.  I'm telling you, we do Hummers before and after the F, and it's just, this morning he told  me no.  I just think he's nuts.  Well, all right.  Believe me, if you like a Hummer, you won't say no to a Hummer, even if you're in a burn  ward.  We did this morning, and I offered, we were going to, and he told me no.  Even if you ladies have your jaw wired shut, we'll still allow you to attack the Hummer. 
[00:26:00]  Still just rub the teeth.  Even if your jaw's wired shut from an incident earlier in the week involving the game, and  you're talking.  We'll accept the rake job, no problem.  Believe you me, I know how to give a Hummer.  Well, it sounds like your boyfriend said no to a Hummer, so that can't be good. 
[00:26:30]  And the fact you said believe you me.  All right, yeah, how would I call it?  Believe you me.  All right.  Definitely his loss.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Denise.  She's really talking it up, isn't she?  But the ladies are out there, and they will give you a Hummer.  Just say, hey, you're a fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  This is for you.  And then, bam.  Yeah.  Just make sure you do the Charles Bronson, right, Anthony?  Yes, ladies.  The Charles Bronson.  Just watch any Charles Bronson movie, and then make his face. 
[00:27:00]  It covers the teeth.  I'm Charles Bronson.  Make a Charles Bronson face.  I dig.  I dig to get out.  What do you use this for?  You know.  Yeah.  Then you and him trade Kinja Tay videos.  That's great.  Martin from Norway.  Just not getting the show.  I think it's time for Martin to find another radio show.  You now have Hummer Tuesday, FU Friday, and Whip Him Out Wednesday. 
[00:27:30]  You are now just as bad as the shows you make fun of.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't.  Poor, poor Martin.  Maybe there's like some kind of.  Poor Martin has a small brain.  Is he from Norway, so he doesn't get like the bit?  Yeah.  He's the don't get the bit guy.  He doesn't get the bit guy.  How they talk there, I don't even know.  Yeah, go away, Martin.  Find another show to listen to.  So, Anthony wants to be a furor.  I'm sorry.  Well, not quite a furor.  I think that's.  I think that word has bad connotations to it. 
[00:28:00]  It's not like, you know.  I'm just thinking a true leader.  This country.  What this country needs right now is a true leader.  We are in a very bad situation as far as the world goes.  We're like the world police, but anything we do gets criticized by that world.  And they don't understand how important our being on this planet is to the stability of the planet. 
[00:28:30]  We are underappreciated.  But the euro over there in Europe, they're getting their own economy going and they're saying, screw you.  And the euro keeps going up and the dollar goes down.  China's hoarding our money.  They're using up all kinds of resources.  Russia isn't this friend of ours anymore.  They're always poking at us for whatever we try to do.  France, don't get me started.  Germany, same thing.  Like they haven't tried a couple of shenanigans over the past century or so.  What about the Irish? 
[00:29:00]  The Irish?  Irish and England have been pretty cool, but I'm sorry.  They're going to have to suffer also.  Really?  Yes, because this plan is very, very direct and very easy.  Here's my plan if I led this country.  First of all, I'm sorry.  Congress, the Senate, all those people, they got to go.  They can't have any input on what I say.  I am like making the rules. 
[00:29:30]  I can't be bogged down by red tape and meetings and hearings and all this other crap that happens because it's just partisan bull that just divvies up the nation and waste time and nothing ever gets done.  So I have to be in charge.  Just let him go.  Let him go.  He's on a roll.  Then what we do?  Yeah.  All of our military that is spread around the globe, making every other little crap country safe.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Pull them back.  Pull them all back.  Every single soldier that belongs to the United States military gets pulled back to the United States of America.  We then get a giant buildup of troops on our carriers, on our destroyers, airborne, Marines, everything.  And we go to Venezuela in a decisive, disgusting display of force that in a war that ends in a day, we take over Venezuela. 
[00:30:30]  No one likes Chavez.  There's oil there up the yin-yang.  Solves our problem with oil.  Can we make a t-shirt? 
[00:31:00]  Venezuela, oil up the yin-yang.  Oil up the yin-yang.  Work on it, brother.  Look, we then, we take them in as, you know, like we got Puerto Rico and stuff.  We own Venezuela.  Yeah.  Anyone who doesn't agree with it or like it down there, you're going to have trouble.  What do we call it?  We can still call it Venezuela.  I got no problem with the name.  You said you want to call it like the 57th state or something.  Yeah, it could be like the 51st state or something.  Somewhere around there.  Look, I'll let the people, I'll give the people like a little bit of freedom to pick a name. 
[00:31:30]  They can do it like American Idol style on TV.  Whatever they want to do.  All right.  But it solves our oil problems.  Okay?  And now we're going to get a lot of flack from the world because they're used to the  old U.S., the U.S. that backs down to all this kind of stuff.  I get up there and I give a speech and I tell the whole world, look, this is the new United  States of America.  This is what we do. 
[00:32:00]  We're taking care of numero uno, the United States of America.  And if anyone doesn't like it, and if anyone, God forbid, tries any shenanigans with this  country, you will see a use of force as you have never seen.  Decisive.  None of this crap where we sit and go and go, oh, we're sorry about civilian casualties  or, oh, we won't use too many troops or, oh, we'll only use smart bomb.  I'm talking devastation to anybody who even tries to interfere with these plans. 
[00:32:30]  Can you add go screw to your speech?  Go screw.  Yeah.  That'll be like my slogan.  Right.  And then we have that.  Wait, what's the slogan again?  Go screw.  Nice.  Then after we have Venezuela, we leave troops there, obviously, so no shenanigans can start  with any of the surrounding nations.  And then we pull, again, a big part of our military back to the U.S. where we guard our  borders.  No one else allowed. 
[00:33:00]  No one allowed in.  You can come and visit if you have a valid passport from a nation like England.  Those are your perks.  And it's the only perks we're going to give you.  You like you're from Australia.  You're from England.  Countries we get along with.  Then you're allowed to come in a little bit and visit.  But you will be monitored and you'll be asked to leave when your time is up.  But this will take care of the problem of us not getting the respect we are due around 
[00:33:30]  the world.  And we will tell the world in 10 years or so, come back crying, crying for us to spread  ourselves around the globe again because it will be utter chaos around the globe without  this country being policemen to the rest of the world.  There will be countries beating the crap out of each other.  And we'll sit back.  And if people think these nuclear nations, these budding nuclear nations are going to  perk up and do something, people will be warned. 
[00:34:00]  For every nuke that has attempted to be sent over in our direction, a completely devastating  nuclear strike will come against their country where they will just not exist anymore.  They won't exist.  So if you want to do that, because we're the big boys on the block, but no one seems to  want to realize that or give us that respect that we are due as a nation that is saving the 
[00:34:30]  globe right now.  Why do you think other countries aren't running in and invading other countries all the time  and taking resources?  The U.S. of A.  We become pussies.  All right.  I got to come.  We need a strong fist.  The fist.  I got a couple of problems.  What?  What party are you going to get elected on?  This is a no party.  The parties will be dissolved.  There will be no Republican or Democratic party.  It's got to be one guy that takes control.  Me, I have to lead this country. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I will once once everything is in place.  I will give up my power.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some other leaders said that once everything's established, I will give up my power.  Is it true that you want to get rid of the mighty dollar?  Well, that suggestion was brought up in exchange for the dollar.  The new denomination called the Kumio will be introduced to the economy.  Uh, that way.  And what does that solve? 
[00:35:30]  That solves the problem of goddamn China owning all our money.  Oh, okay.  Now, China can whip around all their useless dollars with the old presidents on them, but  we'll be printing up the Kumias.  The, the $1 Kumia, the, the $5 Kumia, and, and that's the money you spend.  And we spend it amongst ourselves.  What do we need?  We need wood.  We need wood.  Uh, we go to our forests and we get wood.  Uh, Venezuela's got some wood.  Uh, we take that as a little perk from our oil thing.  We take our wood and then we pay people in Kumias to, uh, uh, make the, uh, lumber. 
[00:36:00]  And then our cars, we, we, we get, uh, iron.  We got all the resources we need here in this country.  Why outsource things?  The country would be so employed and so prosperous under my rule.  Now, uh, can I be on like, uh, something?  Yes.  All my friends will be on my, like, committees.  I will have committees.  No, no, no.  I want to be on like a, like a dollar bill or something.  No.  I mean, they're called Kumias, but can I like be the face of one? 
[00:36:30]  No, my face has to be on all of them.  You can maybe get the back of one somewhere.  Like, you can get the back of one on, like a little picture by one of the buildings,  by my chancellery, uh, the White House.  Uh, and Jimmy can be there.  But, but this, this is what we, the times right now are calling for this.  Can I be, uh, in charge of the national cereal?  Sure.  I'll put you in charge of the national cereal. 
[00:37:00]  The national breakfast cereals?  Yes.  It is a great plan for a great nation.  Hold on, hold on.  I was just, yes?  Hold on, I was just joking, but if you're going to be like the Fuhrer and the money's  going to be the Kumias, what do you got for little old me?  Jimmy will be the head of the Ministry of Comedy.  Your job will be to, because let me tell you, no, it's a very important job.  Because the people, when they're ruled under an iron fist of one leader, tend to get a 
[00:37:30]  little edgy.  They tend to get a little like they want to kill the leader sometimes.  Your job will be to find comedians that can then go around the country and keep people  laughing, keep morale up during this, uh, these tough, uh, initial times until this  plan kicks in and people love it.  I'll produce 30 films with Bill Engvall.  Do it!  It's on!  You read the review on his sitcom too, huh?  Oh boy.  Uh, Opie?  What about me?  Opie, you will be minister of communication. 
[00:38:00]  Ooh, button push.  Now you're, not button push.  Your job will be to, uh.  Does that mean I get to push some, you know.  You're in charge of the state-run radio.  To get some real things done?  Ugh.  Now all, but it's not like now.  I want to be the official button pusher for every button.  How about this?  What?  FCC dissolved.  There will be no FCC.  You will be the voice of the nation.  Nice.  And you could then delegate that responsibility, of course, under, you know, my approval, to 
[00:38:30]  whatever, whoever you want to hire.  Of course.  Yes, and the comedians, as minister of comedy, you cannot mock the president, the leader, me.  You can't mock me.  I can't be made fun of.  A lot of people suggesting that I should be on the penny, at least.  Um, what do you mean, no, E?  E-Rock is saying no.  What the hell is he going to be in charge of? 
[00:39:00]  Minister of nothing.  He's there so that the people, the public, can look and go, my God, it can be so much  worse.  I could be him.  Yeah.  You're an example.  He'll be the pro-choice face.  Right.  Hey, we got Syracuse checking in.  This is a very, very rare thing.  Uh, Steve in Syracuse, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Good, Steve.  Yeah, I came up with a great idea while I was washing myself in the shower.  Yeah.  It's a diabolical laugh Tuesday. 
[00:39:30]  If anything, he's going to be an evil ruler, he needs a diabolical laugh.  Yeah, we're not evil.  We need the official, uh, diabolical laugh.  Of...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Tim, take that and make a sweeper, please.  Immediately.  There's... 
[00:40:00]  It's not evil.  This is a plan that needs to be put in place.  It's a diabolical laugh Tuesday.  Diabolical sounds diabolical.  This is a plan that is needed in this day and age.  America is divided right now.  The world looks at us like we're a bunch of, uh, uh, uh, jackasses.  We don't get the respect for all we do for this planet.  I'm raising my hand now.  That's the only way we're allowed to talk at this point.  Um, how about we start slow? 
[00:40:30]  How about we start, like, our own society?  Like, uh...  Nope.  The Opie and Anthony Society.  Can't be.  Or how about we build our own city?  Because the government...  We built this city.  The government then sees that as some kind of threat.  And this has to be done immediately.  I don't know how.  I think I just gotta ask.  They could say no.  And then I gotta go with plan B.  What's plan B?  But I'm just gonna ask, uh, uh, the president and, uh, Congress  if I could just do this. 
[00:41:00]  Ooh.  If I could just, you know, let me step in.  It's diabolical laugh Tuesday.  The way to start to gain power is you go home to home  and you slaughter all families found to be in the possession of plums.  Okay, that could be a good start.  I just think it's time.  Someone is suggesting maybe we should just try to get ourselves on the front page  of, uh, the XM radio website before we attempt to get on money. 
[00:41:30]  That's a good idea.  Words hurt.  Maybe if I...  Words hurt.  If I offer...  Yeah.  ...the present government...  Yeah.  ...600 billion kumias.  Ooh.  Just gotta print them up.  Nice.  Maybe they'll be like, wow.  Now, when the government changes over to just me being the leader,  and we take Venezuela...  Should we have a contest?  Like, someone's gonna, like, you know, invent the kumia now?  Uh, the design.  We accept the design of the kumia. 
[00:42:00]  All right, all right, all right.  I think, uh, some of the message boards, uh, I know there's a lot of talent over at the  whack bag, uh, on the Photoshop section.  Uh, could you design the kumia?  And then we want them printed up and sent to the station.  Yes.  I want a stack of kumias.  Yeah.  I have an idea that the kumia should be...  It should be a horse's ass, and the denomination is determined by where the tail is pointing.  I may be insulted, Minister of Comedy.  No, no, no. 
[00:42:30]  The horse is a beautiful animal.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it feels just like a person, apparently.  I...  All right.  All right.  All right, we're on to something.  I like this.  Well, that's just, you know something, a lot of people with a lot of, uh, complaints and  questions and stuff, I'm the only one delivering an answer, a concise answer to the problems  of this nation.  God, you were doing all the heavy lifting last night.  I was reading Jimmy's Happy Endings book.  See?  You're getting real things done.  I'm just enjoying a nice read. 
[00:43:00]  I'm an answer man.  Whether you like my idea or not, it's an answer.  To all the problems.  Right.  Every problem.  Done.  Yeah, what did he do?  Steve.  Well, we all know.  Yes.  The minister of flaming fashion.  I'm the minister of diction.  With or without the shin.  Oh, we got a call from India.  We got a call from India. 
[00:43:30]  After the break.  India?  Uh, main checking in.  What's, what's up, uh, Sven?  Steven?  Yeah, that's me.  What's your name?  That's me.  What's your name?  Uh, Sven.  Yeah.  It's, uh, it's the Swedish name, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  What do you got there?  Well, hey, I got a diabolical laugh for Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  Well, I gotta be honest with you.  Yeah, we don't have a sweeper, so it's not official yet.  It's not official, but let me, let me hear.  He might be able to fit into my cabinet somewhere.  All right, go ahead.  If he's, uh, good.  Well, I've also got an idea for you for letting visitors in the country under your rule, which 
[00:44:00]  I love the idea, by the way.  Thank you.  A lot of people are agreeing with my, uh, idea.  They love it.  Anybody that wants to come in has to have a valid passport, and they all have to wear  one of those ankle bracelets we give out to felons now.  Oh!  That way you can track them everywhere they go.  And think of the economy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ooh, wow, that's diabolical.  Wait, wait, wait, but we interrupted you, and I think Ted, oh, did he hang up?  Yeah.  Oh, he was so, he knew he had a good fight.  That was diabolical.  I did interrupt him a little bit. 
[00:44:30]  I'm not going to be the minister of marshmallows, Trey.  Didn't the communists try this?  It didn't work.  I'm not talking communism here, my friend.  You're talking about an entire society turning inward and solely relying on itself.  I'm not asking for everybody to pitch in for just work and give me all their money and I'll divvy it up amongst them.  The American dream will still live.  Capitalism within ourselves will live on. 
[00:45:00]  People that will be rich, that will be poor, who might have to be, you know, taken care of.  And by that, I don't mean given a bed and three squares.  You mean used for fuel?  Well, we have Venezuelan oil, so perhaps we can labor something.  I don't know.  But we'll find something for them to do.  We're talking more of a utopia.  Right.  But isn't the American dream predicated on people from outside?  If you use the word predicated again.  It was.  Let me tell you another thing. 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to get up with a chisel and reword some of that stuff that the lady in the harbor is holding on that book cover.  It's not going to be a welcome sign anymore.  I think it works.  And the people agreeing in droves.  This is very encouraging for me.  Very encouraging.  Anthony, are we allowed to take a break?  Opie, you are the Minister of Communications.  It's your call.  See?  I am soft and gentle when I need be. 
[00:46:00]  So I still have a little power.  Of course you do.  You run the entire communications of the United States of America.  Official button pusher?  Official button pusher.  For all?  For all.  Jimmy, you are the Minister of Comedy.  Could you remind people of this?  Help make the people laugh.  Minister of Comedy is now doing it.  My whole plan is coming together.  Right in front of your eyes.  I love this.  I'm the official button pusher.  Jimmy is the Minister of Comedy. 
[00:46:30]  And E-Rock's doing nothing.  This is going just as planned.  Well, as per the generosity of President Kumeya, he has demanded that all tickets be only $10  so that all people can come out and enjoy the comedic festivities.  Is the public applauding these things?  Don't we have the public?  Why don't we open the windows so the people that are gathered outside can listen to Jimmy  giving his address and his speech and perhaps listen to the public reaction? 
[00:47:00]  Yes, let me.  President Kumeya wants all people to enjoy comedy for $10.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But he has said this will only happen in Boston, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and PNC.  in Homedel, New Jersey. 
[00:47:30]  Wait!  He has said also Philly.  And he has said that Philly will continue until Friday.  I am generous.  Because according to him, there are less Jews in Philly.  Well, I don't know where that came from.  I think you're comparing me to somebody else.  And he has said that it will all begin this morning at 9 a.m. on Ticketmaster. 
[00:48:00]  It's the beginning of my reign.  Oh, no.  What, what, what, what, what, Jimmy?  What, what, what happened?  What, what, what, what, what, what, what?  For all traveling.  Don't read that.  Brought to you by, brought to you by Bud Light.  Dude, no, this is sponsored by the liver of President Kumeya.  Bud Light, always worth it. 
[00:48:30]  Yes, it is.  The official beverage of my new nation.  Our, our new nation.  That's right.  I slipped a little bit.  I'm going to push a button.  He has also said.  He has demanded that, that great comedians be on the show like Rich Voss.  Sorry, Rich Voss is hauling rocks somewhere in the desert. 
[00:49:00]  I've, I've had to move him, his location.  God, you're making me sweat today.  Can I push a button?  Please, Minister of Communications.  Ooh, I'm going to push this one.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy's going to be in Chicago later today, right, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, I will be actually.  I'm doing a signing tonight at 7.30 at Borders in North Clark Street in Chicago. 
[00:49:30]  And I fly right after the show to do the Steve Dahl show first.  Oh, you're doing Steve Dahl today?  Yeah, yeah.  Say hi to Steve.  Unless there's belays at the airport, but yeah, I want to do Steve's.  Very, very cool.  Good morning to everyone listening on CKG.  Kenny wants, wants a position in your new government there, Anthony.  All right.  Suggestion, Kenny?  Yes, I would like to pledge my allegiance to the new leader and the new governor, a government.  And I would like to respectfully request to be made the Duchess of Dunces. 
[00:50:00]  Why the Duchess?  You can be the Duke of Dunces.  The Duchess is like...  The Duke is John Wayne.  No, I'm talking more of a...  Kenny.  Can I be the Sir of Stupids?  No, I like the Duchess of Dunces.  It kind of fits in a weird way. 
[00:50:30]  Duchess of Dunces.  All right.  I'm not quite...  I don't like the whole, you know, monarchy thing it conjures up, but...  Yeah.  No, you deserve it.  No, he's saying he really doesn't...  I don't like the term because it harkens to a monarchy, which I don't agree with.  You know, it's figurehead kind of a thing, which...  What do you mean?  I get no power?  Duchesses and Dukes and Kings and stuff like that.  They actually don't do anything. 
[00:51:00]  They're gone.  Can't bring them over here.  No, we don't want them.  I'm talking about an iron fist of power.  That's what you got.  Yeah, that would be me.  You work on it.  I want to give him a job.  The minister of fruit.  Minister of fruit.  You're very good at that.  How about the food of fetcher?  You could be the minister of farming.  And you just make sure that the cantaloupes, honeydews, and blueberries are okay. 
[00:51:30]  That's right.  And you can have all the fun carrying bananas however you see fit.  Isn't he terrific?  Well, I could fit at least two.  And to make Opie's job easier, the E will be taken out of the word berries.  Oh, thank you.  So it's just blue breeze.  Blue breeze.  End of the R.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of instant feedback coming in after that rant by Anthony.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, Opie, I want to be minister of propaganda. 
[00:52:00]  Oh.  Well, he would be good at that.  He would be good at that.  Yeah.  If you're just turning in, Anthony.  Anthony gave the solution to our problems here in America.  I have all the solutions to the United States' problems, every single one of them.  And I summed it up in minutes.  He basically wants to be the new leader.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  The country needs that right now.  All right.  Also, Fancy Man from OA Experience writes, who else saw Anthony parading around his house 
[00:52:30]  in nothing but his Nazi hat and socks practicing this speech last night?  Loudly as the moonlight, it started quiet.  I think I can be in charge.  And then a couple of minutes later, the moonlight is shining through and his fist is in the air  and he's screaming about what races must be put into camps.  I haven't brought, if you've noticed, I have not brought race into this.  You have not, but it will come.  That was the big mistake of another person who thought he could take control of a nation. 
[00:53:00]  Don't be mistaken.  He's got a brand new idea that hasn't been tried before.  Right.  This is new.  It might have some borrowed, you know.  It might sound a little familiar.  There are some suggestions from other leaders.  But I like Timmy's visual.  We all know that something weird goes on at the Kumia abode.  I must say, I did always like the Third Reich's clothing.  It was very snappy. 
[00:53:30]  Very snappy dressers.  They had that nice long leather jacket and the boots were nice.  The suits were cut very nicely.  The best dressed army on the face of the earth.  Yeah, but the problem that Timmy has pointed out many times in the past, you don't wear the full uniform at night.  No.  No, no.  Why would I?  Not around the house.  What you would have on.  This is what you'd be screaming.  This is the race that you would go after.  It wouldn't be the Jews.  It wouldn't be the blacks.  It wouldn't be Asians.  It wouldn't be people that people would think.  It would be the Eskimos.  Because they're dirtying the snow. 
[00:54:00]  With Eskimo logs.  And so you'd be in the moonlight screaming and just in the mirror and your fist shaking.  And you'd be standing there with a long black leather Nazi coat and a stocking cap.  Not unlike the one that guy wore the night before Christmas.  That guy.  Why would I wear a stocking cap and a Nazi jacket?  I don't know.  And your girlfriend would come out and go, baby. 
[00:54:30]  And you'd turn around and your fists would be clenching and unclenching at your sides.  And you're standing in a puddle of your own soiled waste.  And she'd go, what's the matter?  And you'd go, I want to go home.  I want to go home.  My God.  I'm just trying to help the nation.  We got lots of instant feedback coming in.  Mike in Merrick, he writes, I think the official beverage should be Bikini Teenies. 
[00:55:00]  Why?  That's a little too fruity.  Why would you bring that back?  People almost forgot about that one.  My nation.  I can't wait until Steve runs in and suggests what the national beverage should be.  I'm telling you, it's all natural.  We constantly produce it.  And it's delicious.  With anything.  Chilled.  Makes wonderful ice cubes.  Butch is asking, what's Jill Nicolini going to be? 
[00:55:30]  Minister of Cleavage.  You can't have something so decadent on the outside like that.  She can be the model of fitness.  And all women who do not meet her physical standards are put down.  All right.  I kind of like that idea.  Put down in the street.  You know what?  I want films of Jill Nicolini.  Yeah.  With other like-minded and attractive women.  Okay. 
[00:56:00]  Filmed in black and white.  Okay.  Throwing around a big beach ball.  Okay.  In very old one-piece bathing suits.  And smiling the whole time.  That's socialism, man.  No, it's physical fitness.  You're borrowing from socialism.  No, fascism.  But I think it looks good.  It makes people want to be fit.  Like her.  We're going to have to develop a whole new section on the fan sites and on our official 
[00:56:30]  website.  Fan sites?  Message boards?  I mean-  Wait a minute.  There's going to be something happening there, too.  There's going to be some changes to the message boards?  There's going to be a few knocks on the doors in the middle of the night.  I like it.  At some of these web owners.  Boy, do I like that.  They will disappear and other people may take their place.  Jimmy Sweeney from Babylon, Long Island.  I want to say good morning to Long Island.  Good morning, Long Island.  We don't acknowledge you guys as much as we should. 
[00:57:00]  Don't have too much fun.  You know Minister Tom can come in and extinguish all fun.  Oh, Jesus.  Please.  What can Tom be the minister of?  Minister of braces.  Yes, all adult men who wear child things.  Also, we got Dre from Whackbag.  Can Jared be minister of duty?  No, he will be put down as the mentally handicapped that are just a burden on society. 
[00:57:30]  He'll be shot in the street and vehicles will just run over him.  Thud, thud, thud, thud.  Like running over a possum.  No, I will be all inclusive.  Everyone will be included in this nation.  Because at this point, we would need the diversity to keep our nation growing without the borders being closed and without the outside influence of the dirty world, the rest of the filthy, uncaring, ungrateful world. 
[00:58:00]  That it will, in ten years from the implementation of my plan, be complete anarchy and begging me to help.  Please, United States.  Please, Anthony.  We need your kumias.  Can you be the person that brings back totally nude strip clubs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Again, the decadence thing might turn some people off, but I'll be able to figure out a way to do that through other parties. 
[00:58:30]  Which I will dub as opposition, but I will be supporting them.  So the people can look at it as the opposition, and I will have like a scapegoat.  I need scapegoats.  Will you be digging up any words in the near future?  There could be a few resurfacing.  I don't know.  I'll have to go to the minister of language that I haven't appointed yet.  Will you be exhuming the word? 
[00:59:00]  Some words may have to be exhumed.  It's always creepy when they have to exhum something.  Exhumed.  Worst word in the English language, exhumed.  It has to smell.  It's just awful.  The minister of language?  Yeah.  Don Imus.  Oh.  He comes back as the minister of language.  I like that.  Using, making official words.  All right.  And Rum Runner from Whack Bag.  Also from Springfield, New Jersey.  He writes, El Presidente. 
[00:59:30]  Ah, yes.  The people think you are playing too much Tropico.  No, I always lose at Tropico.  Oh, great.  I try to rule with an eye.  You lose at Tropico, but you're going to try this in the real world?  Because those computer people don't understand.  They don't understand.  I will.  The people will be happy.  Yeah.  They will not be, you know, it might be a shock at first.  You know, when they can't get rubber dog duty from China.  There's going to be a shortage of rubber dog duty. 
[01:00:00]  But I plan in Flint, Michigan to open up rubber dog duty plants to employ the people.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello?  Where the hell am I?  Applause.  Flint, Michigan is getting all the rubber dog duty plants.  That is a good point.  That is a great point.  Someone close the window.  Why?  We can't hear the crowd.  Why is the window not open?  Rubber dog duty plants in Flint, Michigan. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, will they be happy over there?  No more poverty in Flint.  Yeah.  By the way, it's now official.  Yes.  It's Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  Oh.  This is a sweeper, so it's got to be official.  It's got to be.  Diabolical Laugh Tuesday.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[01:01:00]  is. Why is Tuesday turned into the big day?  I don't know. I don't know either. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  It's a mystery.  Hey, Steve S. from Bayshore has submitted  his, what? What has he got over there,  A? He's got a  Hail Kumia rock scream.  Oh, he does?  What? Did he just email us  in or something? Yeah. Okay, let's hear it.  He's good like that.  Wow, I like the musical background. 
[01:02:00]  Reich scream.  Reich scream.  Very good. 
[01:02:30]  Thank you, Steve. Have you guys heard the  Obama girl song yet? What the hell's going on with this?  Does anyone know what this is all about?  Yeah, it's about totally undermining him  getting any votes in the Midwest.  Really? Oh, of course it is.  But they're trying to figure out where this came from.  Who put this out? The Republicans.  You think? Wouldn't you?  Why? It's just a bunch of, they're just singing  for Obama, right? This?  Yeah, but let me tell you something  about middle America.  They don't like hip-hop.  They don't like rap.  They don't like Obama being 
[01:03:00]  tied to this attitude.  They don't like big-breasted women  singing cute songs.  See, hip-hop scares  white middle America.  Yes, hip-hop, rap, and Obama.  What do those three things have in common?  It's blacks they don't like in the Midwest.  All right.  That's true.  Not everybody in the Midwest.  There's a few.  But there's, you know,  a lot of people that aren't very tolerant.  Yeah.  Aren't very loving.  So what is this about?  Well, it's some song. 
[01:03:30]  No, I understand the song,  but who put this out?  It's all over the TV.  It's all over the internet.  And now there's other songs popping up.  There's a follow-up song called  Obama Girl vs. Giuliani Girl.  And Giuliani's pissed off  that he's being, you know,  pulled into this whole thing.  Isn't it amazing how the internet  has become such a power base  that it, at least in the candidates' eyes,  is affecting their popularity  in the elections?  Did you ever think this stupid machine  would actually have such influence?  And it's only beginning, my friend. 
[01:04:00]  Well, here it is.  It's, I got a crush on Obama.  I have a crush on Obama.  Song by Obama Girl.  That's all we know.  Yeah.  See, can you see Mr. Middle America?  Holy crap.  Pulling the lever.  What?  Hold on.  What day is today?  The 17th?  Tuesday.  Two days before Jimmy's birthday.  Yes, that's why it was released  in celebration.  Two days before Jimmy's real birthday. 
[01:04:30]  This thing has only been out  like three days.  I'm looking at YouTube.  Yeah.  2.4 million views already.  Yep.  It's getting a lot of publicity.  And our Doody Hat video  has got 72 views.  What the hell's going on?  It's moving, though.  Hey, Sam's in studio.  Sam.  I have a crush on Obama.  The first video  has been out for a couple weeks.  Isolate this.  Yeah.  You got a crush on Obama, really?  No, no.  Really?  What do you like about it?  The first video  has been out for a couple weeks. 
[01:05:00]  The second one  is the one.  What video?  Just say it.  I have a crush on Obama.  The song?  Music video?  That helps putting the song  in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, we can't cut it  after a slight pause.  Hey, what'd you have  for dinner last night?  Hold on.  We need the official music.  Oh, you got it?  All right, go ahead.  Up goes the weasel.  He eats like an eight-year-old  is what we've noticed.  So, what was dinner last night?  Be honest. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, it was chicken wings?  It was more bagel bites.  He loves those bagel bites.  Oh, and baby carrots.  That's for the third thing.  Again, baby carrots.  And a beverage  to wash this down with?  A whole milk.  Ah, milk.  And of course...  I don't get it, man.  Of course, dessert.  Your favorite.  Yeah.  Oh, I went for a Coke float.  A Coke float.  So, that's ice cream.  Ice cream and Coke.  And Coke. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  And, boy, sucking that down  must have been great.  Oh, it was.  It was really good.  Enjoy.  As soon as you turn 30...  Oh, it goes right to your gut.  He might be one of those guys  that just can eat  whatever he wants forever.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, now we got to do  Obama Girl after the break.  So, stand by there, Sam.  Hey, $10 tickets going on sale  when?  In an hour and a half, Jimmy?  Well, as per the generosity...  Mm-hmm.  ...of...  I'll come up with a title 
[01:06:30]  for myself.  Okay.  Of yet-to-be-determined boss.  Mm-hmm.  We have $10 tickets  beginning at 9 a.m.  on Ticketmaster  for Boston, Detroit,  Washington, D.C.,  and PNC in Holmdel,  as well as the Tweeter Senny  and...  Tweeter Senny.  Senny.  I like Tweeter Senny.  Yeah, Cicenter is an awful name,  the Tweeter Senny.  Tweeter Senny.  For everybody in the Philly area.  Yeah, it sounds sweeter.  In Philadelphia,  $10 lawn seats  going on sale for today, 
[01:07:00]  9 a.m. until midnight tonight,  unless you're in Philly,  and then you have until Friday.  But then again,  if you're in the military  and you live in Boston,  you can go for free  with a military ID up in Mansfield.  Yeah.  And I think we're extending that  to all the cities, by the way.  I think.  Really?  I don't know where we are with that.  I think there's going to be  an official press release today.  Nice.  Opie and Anthony, do good.  Read.  Why did he sneeze after that?  That was dramatic and everything.  Exactly.  All right.  We'll do the Obama girl next.  How's that? 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Yes, man.  I think we got those plugs in today.  We got to move on to this plug next.  Oh, my God.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony  and a little Jimmy Norton,  who's going to be in Chicago  later on today.  He's going to be doing  the Steve Dahl show  for everybody listening on CKG.  And he's doing a book signing  at...  Borders at 730 tonight  on North Clark Street.  My new book,  it's all about the rise to power 
[01:08:00]  of...  Yes.  We don't have a name  for your title.  Yeah.  I don't want to use  anything past history.  It might.  Yeah.  Okay.  By the way,  we wasted so much time,  we lost our faraway phone call  for faraway phone call.  Oh, where was it from?  India.  Wow.  That is a hop,  skip, and a jump.  We were too busy  listening to you  rant and rave  that we missed out  on faraway phone call  more important.  More important.  It's also  Hummer Tuesday, 
[01:08:30]  Rock Scream Tuesday.  It also appears to be  during the commercial,  show how gay  your iPod selection is  Tuesday,  because during the commercial  break,  we're all having,  because we got our iPhones now.  Yeah, yeah.  And our music catalog  is on there.  I'm still rocking  the Motorola.  Oof.  I'm still rocking  the Pebble.  You're like,  you're like that  old TV show,  Canon.  You have the phone  in your car.  Hello, mobile operator. 
[01:09:00]  Get me 555-1313.  I was hip for about a day,  as far as this staff goes.  Yeah.  I came in with the Pebble,  and everyone was  oohing and on.  I was like one of the first  people to get the Pebble.  Yeah.  And, well,  it just didn't take off.  No, now it's just kind of,  we're all playing our songs.  Jimmy, what did you have  on yours that you  started playing?  Frankie Lyman.  First.  Frankie Lyman,  Why Do Fools Fall in Love?  That's right.  And then,  and then Sam 
[01:09:30]  decided to start playing  some Uptown Girl,  which he seems to have  on there.  And I couldn't be outdone,  so I pulled out my iPhone  and cranked up  Duran Duran's Notorious.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Notorious.  Notorious.  Yuck.  No, no,  notorious.  Could be the official  state song.  Watch it.  All right.  We got Obama Girl. 
[01:10:00]  Play it from,  what?  What are you getting at?  Play it from Jimmy's iPod.  Here's Obama Girl.  So this is by Amber.  Who?  That's her?  That's her.  What?  She is hot.  Who the,  what the,  wow.  Amber Lee Edinger,  E-T-T-I-N-G-E-R.  She got booty.  What?  As they say.  What?  Edinger.  What?  Edinger?  She's on the cover  of Maxim Magazine,  MaximOnline.com.  Where's she at? 
[01:10:30]  Man,  she is hot.  So what,  she's trying to get  a singing career going?  Her.  And she found a way  to get everyone  to pay attention  to her dumb voice.  Look at how good she,  Al,  you might have to dump this,  but I wouldn't mind  taking her for a malted.  Wow.  Just in case.  I got something.  Look at her hiney.  She has a cute coolie.  She's got a nice hiney.  Cooley.  Remember,  exhume,  the worst word ever.  Oh,  wow. 
[01:11:00]  She's lovely.  Now we're just staring  at a picture.  That's great.  Sorry.  I have sex with her  after she was exhumed.  It's been done.  You know you're hot  when someone says  they'll have sex with you  after you're exhumed.  After you're dead  and exhumed.  Just bring Astro Glide  and a clothespin  for your nose.  All right,  Obama Girl.  So this is the chick  that's singing this,  Amber Lee Ettinger.  Mm-hmm.  Ettinger?  What?  Does it matter?  All right,  here it is,  Obama Girl. 
[01:11:30]  Song is awful,  but she's a piece of ass.  It's called  I Got a Crush  on Obama.  Thank all of you  for your time,  your suggestions,  your encouragement,  and your prayers.  And I look forward  to continuing  our conversation  in the weeks  and months to come.  Hey, B.  It's me.  B.  If you're there,  pick up.  I was just watching you  on C-SPAN.  Anyway,  call me back.  You seem to float 
[01:12:00]  onto the floor.  Democratic convention 2004.  I never wanted anybody more  than I want you.  So I put down my carry sign.  Knew I had to make you mine.  Whoa.  Smart black and sexy,  you're so fine.  Because I got a crime.  I'm not sure  I'm not gonna wait. 
[01:12:30]  Holy crap.  Did you see this video?  She's in a bikini.  This is more of a visual  than an audio bit, man.  How great would it be  if he threw out  his political career  and just started  banging her?  Some things  are more important.  Oh, hell.  Wow.  Just gives it up.  Wow.  In bikinis  and everything.  What kind of background  would you say  she is?  She's probably a mix.  Is she Hispanic? 
[01:13:00]  She looks like she's...  She's got a little bit  of everything in her.  Yeah?  A little bit,  a little bit.  She looks like she's...  She definitely looks  Puerto Rican.  You throw a few races together.  They just make supermodels.  It's just the way it is.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  You never see anybody  who's half black  and half white  with Down syndrome.  No.  They're just supermodels.  They got nice,  like,  big,  big curly hair.  Sometimes a little blonde  in it.  The blue eyes.  We might have to say...  Nice dark skin. 
[01:13:30]  We might have to say  goodbye to Jill Nicolini,  I'm starting to think.  No.  This Amber Lee girl  is pretty hot.  Don't you?  Look.  Look at Jill.  Amber Lee has a big forehead.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  One of the dudes  from Rescue Me.  When are we going to get  Rescue Me people  on our show?  We get the head  Rescue Me guy.  Yeah, exactly.  Dennis Leary.  And we got Adam Farrar.  We didn't get Dennis Leary.  We can get him.  He blew us off.  We've had him on the show.  He blew us off.  Adam Farrar has to come  on our show  because you guys  are pretty much  childhood friends.  Bastard better. 
[01:14:00]  We got Lenny Clark.  Now that he's the chief.  What's his name  is going to be on Jill TV?  I forgot his name.  Byron Allen?  No.  What's his name  on Rescue Me?  Byron Allen.  Franco.  Thank you.  Yeah, Franco's  going to be on Jill TV  and we get nothing.  And then Kevin James  blows us off  and then I find out  he's doing that TRL yesterday.  So he's back in town.  So why isn't he doing  our show?  Calling Adam.  But after yesterday's  trashing of his movie,  I guess he won't be  on our show.  We didn't trash the movie,  just the poster.  Oh, good point.  Good point.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Please, that poster's  so bad.  Good point.  Put that picture back up  before I punch you  on the monitor.  Back to Obama girl.  Her forehead is awful.  That's her too?  Yes.  Oh, I don't like her anymore.  Her forehead is out of place.  Her head is atrocious.  She looks like  that hooker chick  from L.A.  All right,  she needs bangs maybe,  but...  She looks like...  What's her name?  Heidi Flight.  Give me another picture.  She looks kind of  Heidi Flight.  She has a head  like that from  Enemy Mine.  Bag of bones.  See, that one's 
[01:15:00]  a good picture.  All right,  that's not bad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's not shabby.  Yeah, but that one picture  was...  Wow, okay.  She looks really good there.  I'm back yet.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd burn my girlfriend  alive to sleep with her,  but she has an oblong head.  I would.  I'd tie her up  and start at her feet  and apologize  that she burned.  That's a bit extreme,  don't you think, Jimmy?  Perhaps that would hurt, Jim.  But this girl's forehead  is long.  Yeah, that one shot.  Yeah, she's got to kind of  make sure the hair 
[01:15:30]  is kind of in the way  of the forehead.  Oh, yeah.  On your face  or on your side,  that's how you get it  in this house.  Let's go back  to Obama Girl.  Obama, Obama,  I wait  just 2008  Barack Obama  baby, you're the best  candidate  I like it when you get hot  on Hillary in debate  Oh, boy, getting  more news coming in.  It's not her singing.  It's not her singing?  Actress, model.  They're doing a little  Milli Vanilli thing here?  Yeah.  Making believe she's singing  but it's another girl singing?  Amberlee is an actress, model 
[01:16:00]  then lip-synced  the song for the video  shot by filmmakers  found on Craigslist  two hours before  Oh, boy.  Rell as an editor  hit New York City  one Friday in May  to shoot the video  on a digital video camera.  It's, well,  does it matter?  It's a joke song.  Yeah, but it's nice  to think that  like hot girls  have another talent  besides being hot.  No.  Don't be silly.  Don't you pick up your phone 
[01:16:30]  Cause I got a crush  on Obama  Baby, you're the best candidate  Up in the Oval Office  You'll get your head of state  I can't leave you alone  Cause I got a crush on Obama  You're into border security  Let's break this border  between you and me  Universal love  careful  It makes me war 
[01:17:00]  Can't she, like,  go to jail?  She sounds like  she's stalking him.  Oh, like,  you're gonna complain?  Girl, like,  this is stalking you?  Like, he's gonna  make a big to-do about it?  You make a right  on Elm Street  You have the top down  with Governor Connolly  And the website's  Obamagirl.com  This is like  a whole phenomenon  going on, huh?  Do you want to hear  the rest of the song?  I don't know  I didn't want to hear  it's not going anywhere 
[01:17:30]  No  It's awful  Horrible  I got to bid  the horseshit  thing about his policy  Stupid  Oh my God  Look at the  hiney shot  Oh, she got Obama  written on her  little hot pants  her little shorts  I hope she's 350  I hope she's just  a big fat pig  with like a spiky  hairdo and a good voice  Wow  Alright  There's a follow-up  song called  Obama Girl  vs. Giuliani Girl  Any interest there?  Maybe the first  few seconds  The Giuliani Girl  is walking around 
[01:18:00]  with a healthy  prostate in her hand  How ugly is  Giuliani Girl?  Probably ugly  You think?  Yeah  She looks like  one of the Spice Girls  Yeah, which one?  Giuliani Girl  What?  Scary  Scary?  Yeah, Scary Spice  Why'd she call herself  Scary?  Because she was  scary  I hated the Spice Girls  I hated them  Well, they're coming back  Oh, great  If you want to see  Trainwreck TV  speaking of the Spice Girls 
[01:18:30]  watch Victoria Beckman's  reality show  It is god-awful  Yeah  Oh, it's so much fun  Some of those things  just don't fly  She just stinks  Just stinks  And why the big phenomenon  with Beckman?  No one cares about  soccer in this country  No  When are we going to realize?  Yeah, all those  Pele made it exciting  for like, what, a season?  Maybe two seasons?  Yeah  All those articles  that come out  about how huge they are 
[01:19:00]  and how they're sweeping  the nation and everything  is, um  They're from English papers  Like the Mirror  Oh, the Mirror's reporting  that it's a big hit  in America  No  It's not  We don't care  We really don't care  We don't care so much  that we're going to  stop talking about  dumb soccer  It's an awful sport  Yeah  Use your hands  It's just dull  Uh, Bill is correcting me  Score is 1-0  after 10 hours  I don't like any guy  that can play an entire game  while holding his coffee 
[01:19:30]  No, I don't like soccer  No close-ups  when you're watching  No  It's all faraway shots  Because the field is  You could race cars on it  It's a ridiculous sport  They play on a NASCAR track  or something  Yeah  Or the infield  of a NASCAR track  Just a bunch of dopes  Their national pride  is around a bunch of men  who are kicking a ball  in a yard  Hey, we are good  Shut up, would you?  We are good  Shut up  Mighty  It's Beckham  not Beckman 
[01:20:00]  Whatever  Whatever it is  Thank you  Thank you, Jimmy  for helping me out  on that one  The carriage looks like  Justin Timberlake  Here's Obama Girl  versus Giuliani Girl  Yeah  We'll give it  like 30 seconds here  Let's go, Obama Girl  Obama  I still want you  Waiting for my phone  to ring  Want you  Follow-up hit  It'd be funny  if Rudy's Girl  just came in  and went  I'm Rudy's Girl  The rat

[01:21:00]  So Obama Girl  is now supporting  Giuliani Girl  How does that make sense?  No, it seems like  Giuliani Girl  is singing about Giuliani  and complimenting him  and, you know,  it's sort of, you know,  bring it  kind of thing  Yeah, but Obama Girl  is in the video  If they were going to bring it  when they, like, throw down  No, because what she's doing  is she's using photos  of Giuliani  as toilet paper  I don't get it  Like, they're working together 
[01:21:30]  They're in  Obama Girl  They're in cahoots  And Giuliani Girl, yes  in cahoots together  That doesn't make sense  And now Sam has brought in  Bagel Bite?

[01:29:00]  Martin from Norway  He writes  You can't complain  about dull sports  when you have baseball  Baseball's better than  Yes indeed  When was the last time  and be honest  And this doesn't count  going to an actual  baseball game  When was the last time  you sat down  and watched an entire  baseball game  An entire game  I cannot do it  I could watch golf  in its entirety  before a baseball game  I can't do it  Sorry Travis  He's throwing his arms 
[01:29:30]  up in the air  Because he's dancing  I just can't do it  My idea is simple  You make our versions  of baseball games  It would be  the hottest thing  The hottest thing  As the season goes on  I start watching  more full games  and high def  they're just  pretty cool to watch  But seriously  when was the last time  you saw  I know you take a peek  at baseball  from time to time  but when was the last time  you actually watched  an entire game  from the first pitch  to the last pitch  Yeah it's been a while  I was at a bar  I watched the Mets game 
[01:30:00]  that one that went into  ridiculous extra innings  Yeah  That the Mets  finally pulled off  I'm a big fan  of the highlights  Love the highlights  That was a while ago  I can't sit through  all this strategy  and a minute between pitches  and then one guy pitches  three balls  and then they take him out  and he's got to warm up  That is a pain in the ass  Can't be bothered  Can't be bothered  A couple things  we've got to do today  Which one do you want  Wow man  That just breaks your heart 
[01:30:30]  really  The cover of the Daily News  Let's do this fast  I don't know if we gave you guys  the update  you probably know by now  but the cop that got shot  in the face  point blank  with a .45  two shots in the face  he was paralyzed  and he was in really  really bad shape  Yeah Russell Timoshenko's family  Well he has died  which might be a good thing  to be honest with you  He would have been paralyzed  Yeah  I mean it was  he would not have had  any type of life 
[01:31:00]  Yeah  It's just a really sad story  here in New York  and everyone's getting  behind this family  and on the front page  of the Daily News today  slain cops' parents  rip accused killers  and the quote is simple  tear them to pieces  Yeah that's what  the father's saying  tear them to pieces  So they should be  yeah  torn to pieces  just animals  they're now up  on murder charges  and  they're trying to get it  to be federal charges 
[01:31:30]  so that the death penalty  Yeah but Mayor Bloomberg  threw his little comments  as far as that goes  he goes  this doesn't need to be  a federal case  we can handle this  on the local level  and all that  Yeah well the example  that New York has said  as far as the death penalty  goes stinks  Yeah but Giuliani said  ah there's no need for that  you know what  the people are calling for it  yes there is a need for that  No  because we have a death penalty  in this state  that we don't even use  No one uses it  We don't even use it  for cop killers  If this isn't the prime example  for a death penalty case 
[01:32:00]  nothing is  and that's why  I mean you know  New Yorkers  they don't have faith  in the system  as far as the death penalty  goes  we've had the death penalty  for how many years  we went over this  the other day  over 10 years  12 years  something like that  and we still haven't  killed anybody  Unprovoked  these two cops  walk up to an SUV  and get shot at  by these savages  That's it  they just get shot at  and one of them  is killed  one of them  is wounded  and they  they catch these guys 
[01:32:30]  and now what  gonna listen to lawyers  just babble on and on  about how these poor guys  grew up  without this  that  and the drugs  and this stupid state  gives them  life in prison  I've always said that  about prison  prison just becomes  part of your life  you live  wherever you are  that might sound simple  but it's true  you might be put  in a horrific situation  but humans are  pretty adaptable  once you're in prison  it becomes the thing 
[01:33:00]  it becomes your normal life  that's it  it doesn't matter  if you live in a cabin  somewhere in the woods  in a luxury house  or a prison  it becomes your life  you're still alive  you still have good times  you have bad times  you're actually  making new friends  you're making friends  and catching up  on your TV shows  and there's activity  you're working  you're earning money  that is spent  in that prison  it just  it sounds horrible  to any of us 
[01:33:30]  thinking  oh my god  if I go to prison  but these guys  they'll go in there  and live their lives  it's just another place  that they'll  live their lives  make their deals  you know it's a great  that's a great way  to look at it  you opened my eyes  to that  that it just becomes  your life  it becomes your life  if you've ever been  through a horrible thing  in your life  whether it's just  the loss of a loved one  a medical problem  when you  imagine that  before it happens  it's the most 
[01:34:00]  awful horrible thing  and you can't imagine  actually surviving  through it  like you think  you'd just mentally  break down  or be crushed by it  or something  but then god forbid  but these things  do happen  it happens to you  you do deal with it  you accept it  and for the most part  you just  you move on  it became part of your life  it's horrible  you couldn't imagine  going through it  but when you have to  and you're forced to  you go through it  prison's the same thing 
[01:34:30]  you think it's an awful  horrible place  which it is  but once you're there  you're part of it  that's your new life  and these guys  do not deserve  to walk around  anywhere  even in a prison  living their lives  they should be put  to death  for what they did  the victim  the victim's family  should have a much  bigger voice  than this whole thing  ask the families  what they want  to happen to these people  tear them to pieces  and if you're stupid enough 
[01:35:00]  to watch your son  die in a horrific way  like this  and you're like  you know  I don't think they deserve  the death penalty  so be it  but let them decide  let the victim's families decide  they're saying today  tear them to pieces  that ain't happening  that's why  when I picked up the paper today  I'm like  oh god  you know  god bless this  these parents  but that ain't happening  they're not gonna tear them  to pieces  I bet in the  Timoshenko family house  I bet a certain word  has a pulse  I bet a certain word 
[01:35:30]  found a pulse  a certain word  has been exhumed  that is something  where you can't  contain  that type of anger  to not  go the distance  and  call these  these  murdering  animals  out  for what they are  the worst  possible thing  you can come up with  well the interesting thing  is like  when there's cops shot  like this  the racial angle  is never mentioned  yet in the dupe  rape case 
[01:36:00]  it's all they harped on  it's all they talked about  why aren't they talking about  three black gentlemen  shooting  a white guy  and an Asian guy  two cops  why aren't they  why aren't they  citing that  as racial  well  as  crook brutality  against  these  officers  we started the bid  a while ago  but  where's Al  yeah  where's Al  he's in hiding right now  right  because this  this is some heavy lifting 
[01:36:30]  right here  you know who he's going  after now  it was in the paper  you know this is a huge story  for New Yorkers right  obviously for the country  yeah  and Reverend Al  getting his stupid nose  into everything  he's going after  and I don't like her  whatsoever  that the young broad  on the view  oh really  Hasselbeck  why what did she do  that's what Reverend Al  is interested in  he actually sent a letter  to Barbara Walters  what did she do  as this thing is going on  that's what he's concerned about  yeah how about you visit 
[01:37:00]  the community  that these guys are from  and you find out  what the problem is  why they're shoving guns  out their window  and shooting police officers  out of stolen cars  why don't you address  that problem Al  or how about you address  the victim's families  and give some kind of  consolation  like you would  if they were  heroin dealers  who were shot by a cop  exactly  where's Jesse Jackson  where's that  with the incoherent mumble  where is he  let me tell you  you know we say  where's Al 
[01:37:30]  well this is what  Al's up to today  the women of ABC's  The View  are expected to discuss  a complaint today  from the Reverend Al Sharpton  that Elizabeth Hasselbeck's  description of his stance  on the n-word  and similar words  was a blatant distortion  of the facts  Sharpton fired off  a letter to show creator  Barbara Walters  and producer Bill Ged  yesterday  outlining his position  that's what Al's up to today  going after the  the chicks on The View  what was he mad at  huh 
[01:38:00]  like what did she say  that got him so  mad  I don't know  maybe we could get  more info on this  his stance  on the n-word  and similar words  was a blatant distortion  of the facts  okay  uh  oh okay  they're calling him silly  god bless him  you know I'm not a big fan  of uh  of uh  Elizabeth Hasselbeck  maybe we could get the audio  we actually have the audio  uh  why don't we get that  for the show  oh  The View got their claws  all over RoboHoGate  this morning  with uh  Sherry Shepard 
[01:38:30]  calling Reverend Al Sharpton  silly for slamming TMZ  and even Elizabeth Hasselbeck  uh  said that the Rev  tussled with the wrong website  yeah TMZ  uh  got in a little trouble  like Reverend Al  went after TMZ.com  and  because he  he uh  used the term RoboHo  to  yeah yeah yeah  it was uh  Beyonce  Beyonce  was dressed in this uh  awful  robot  looking dress  and her hips  looked huge  remember we saw  their picture of that 
[01:39:00]  and uh  someone made a wisecrack  and called her RoboHo  right  which uh  what's the problem there  that's what Reverend Al  is going after  language  he's going after language  instead of real issues  like uh  real issues  like  what the hell's going on  in his community  why are an SUV  full of uh  black guys  shooting at white  and Asian police officers  you know and  and if those cops  would have maybe  had an inkling  that uh  there was a gun  in the car  and opened fire  on that vehicle  and killed those  three gentlemen  uh  Al would have been 
[01:39:30]  out there in full force  of course  why on white  on Asian officers  unloading  and they'd have  counted the shots  how many shots  did they fire  blah blah blah  well uh  apparently the guy  uh uh  in the passenger seat  um  fired a couple of shots  and killed an officer  yeah  and where's Al  there's no Al  not a phony  how about you fire off  a letter  to the cops  parents  sending some kind of  why don't you do that 
[01:40:00]  yeah where are some  condolences  why don't you do that  the same way you do it  for guys in the community  who are selling dope  to children in the community  and get beaten up  by the cops  because he's a separatist  he he doesn't treat  um  white victims  the way he treats  black victims  worst  he doesn't  he never will  because he is  a racist  race baiting  separatist  can I uh  continue with this story  so TMZ had the  robo-ho comment  and Reverend Al  didn't like that  and Shepard took  the strongest line 
[01:40:30]  on The View  against Sharpton  saying he was silly  for criticizing  our use of robo-ho  and reiterating  yet again  that it was her  outfit  not the singer  herself  on which TMZ  was commenting  because she looked  like a robo-cop  right  obviously  and how about this  there was saying  joke robo-cop  part whore  part cop  and it was a joke  and that's what it meant  god almighty  Elizabeth  after briefly  uh  confusing TMZ  managing editor  Harvey Levin  with film honcho  Harvey Weinstein 
[01:41:00]  recognized our  equal opportunity  celeb stabbing  citing the coinage  posh-shit-toot  as proof  she added that  Reverend Al  was selectively  advocating  and that he'd  gone after the wrong  person  don't mess with the bull  you'll get the horns  that's what Reverend Al  is concerned with today  going after the view  ugh  good  oh he's gonna be  uh  where's my Reverend Al song  you want the Reverend Al song  oh it's fitting  all these years  and it still works  you got the Reverend Al song 
[01:41:30]  because it fits him perfectly  we made this song  or Anthony made this song  I should say  wrote it and everything  years ago  this has to be  eight years ago  maybe  and it's still fitting  probably eight years ago  you got it  the Reverend Al song  who comes running  when the cops  get out of hand  who thinks the mayor's  in the Ku Klux Klan  yelling and screaming  as he's speaking  to a mob  he wears expensive  suits  but he doesn't  have a job  Reverend Al 
[01:42:00]  Reverend Al  he's your pal  Reverend Al  well he's sapping  well he's sapping off  the people  in his own community  why is the white man  always picking on me  he's got a fat belly  and his hair's full of grease  you hear his battle cry  no justice  no peace  the man with a plan  who you know  you can trust  the portly little reverend  with an ass  just like a boss 
[01:42:30]  he's Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he's your pal  Reverend Al  he looks like James Brown  with too many calories  now why is the white man  always picking on me  remember Bernie Getz  and the Brawley case  turn on the TV  you would always see his face  he's speeding in his limo  to another homicide  to make the network news  with the family 
[01:43:00]  by his side  Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he's your pal  Reverend Al  on a never ending search  for some good publicity  why is the white man  always picking on me  Reverend Al  I'm Reverend Al  he's Reverend Al  I'm Reverend Al  his tummy growls  I'm hungry  he's Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he will represent your family  and he doesn't charge a fee  now as long as the footage  makes it on the TV 
[01:43:30]  Reverend Al  I'm Reverend Al  he's Reverend Al  I'm your pal  well he's your pal  that's right  Reverend Al  he's Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he's a race-baiting  white-hating  bag of baloney  now why is the white man  always picking on me  Reverend Al  yeah I'm out  he's Reverend Al  Reverend Al  he's your pal  I'm your pal  what a great song  Reverend Al  bravo to Anthony  Reverend Al  he's your pal  that was done like 
[01:44:00]  eight years ago  I like yogurt from Cleveland  don't you guys get it  only black people  can be victims  we've said it a few times  on the show  someone brought it  to our attention  it's a double standard thing  just admit it's a double standard  and we can all move on  right  a white man in a tie  once told me  that white people  were the oppressors  and therefore  that's the way things are  ah  yes  I seem to remember that  good point  valid point  and then I want to know  more about this  yeah  Joe from Jersey  Jesse Jackson is busy 
[01:44:30]  praying with Barry Bonds  at Wrigley Field  wish I was joking  is there any truth to that  that should be number  8162  on things  he should be doing  hey let's go to  let's go to Mike in Brooklyn  hey there Mike  what's up Mike  what's up guys  how's everything  hey good  I wish I could have called you  guys talking about it  better though  you know  but Russell was a friend of mine  I worked with the guy 
[01:45:00]  you know  and these guys  just got ambushed  by a bunch of scumbags  you know  yeah  these guys  these guys shouldn't have been out  on for all  or anything like that  yeah they were out  they had records  that were like  why  why are they out  the one guy  had raped  I was part of a gang rape  teenage girl  yeah  and he's out  oh boy  he sure learned his lesson  I'm sure  I'm glad  you know  the prison system  taught him  a lesson  this guy's just gonna go back in 
[01:45:30]  and take up where he left off  it's just a disgrace  they're gonna be considered gods  when they go to prison  of course  cop killers in prison  you're the mac daddy  in there  that is coming in like crazy  I'm gonna use a 1986 term  that's coming in like crazy  I'm a cop  cop killers are heroes in jail  so they're even treated  better than the average  prisoner  the community that he served  everybody over there  they hold these guys  in such high regards  like the two cops  that got shot  yep  I mean 
[01:46:00]  the city's been looking out for them  I know  that we set up funds  for the families  and everything like that  I mean  it's just  it's just a horrible situation  that  that's how it doesn't  come into play in this  yeah  and they all pled not guilty  because  I just want to love to hear  what their excuses are  oh the excuses  and the lawyers  have any black leaders  at all reached out  to the victims families  just to say  we're sorry  to hear about what happened  just as people  not even as  of course not  no I'm just  it's funny 
[01:46:30]  there's a divided  nation  and a divided city here  that is just ridiculous  and it's so obvious  and right in front  of everyone's face  but no one wants to address it  for fear of being called a racist  so they do  white people  it's our fault  of course it is  it's our city  that we live in  now  we have to worry about  everything that we do  well  well  address it  there are problems  in the black community  that need to be addressed  and it doesn't mean  praying with Barry Bonds 
[01:47:00]  and it doesn't mean  coddling a drug dealer  after he's clipped  by a cop in a hospital  and then having  Reverend Al march  against the police department  it has to do with  getting  a message out  to people  that you have to  raise your children  properly  you can't have  20 of them  with 20 different fathers  you gotta assimilate  to this society  don't have the kids  out on the street  3.30 in the morning  4 o'clock in the morning  don't think that  there's nothing wrong 
[01:47:30]  with it  but when the kids  get arrested  oh but there's  good kids  there at school  yeah everyone's a good kid  there was  there was a girl  recently  and these are always  tragic events  when you get  like a young girl  11, 12, 13 year old girl  walking down the street  and she gets shot  because two dopes  don't know how to  aim at each other  and shoot each other  and then  you read the story  and you go  why was she out  at 2.30 in the morning  like even the poor  innocent girl  that got shot  isn't being taken care of 
[01:48:00]  by her parents  they're out there  to you know  cry and yell  why aren't the police  here to protect us  but why is that kid  out at 2.30  and how come  then when the police  show up to protect  they're treated like crap  they're told to leave  no one cooperates  with them  and they wonder  why the neighborhoods  in these housing projects  are just bevies of crime  it's ridiculous man  according to the mayor  the crime is down  in the city though  yeah  yeah  crime is down  that's just that crap 
[01:48:30]  there's still a major problem  I don't care if the stats  are down a bit  year to year  the stats are down  but you know something  black on black crime  is ridiculously high  it's ridiculously high  but that's some tough  that's some tough stuff  to tackle  right right  you need some heavy lifting  to take care of that  type of thing  right Reverend Al  he knows  because there's no one  to march against  go after the easy stuff  like the girls on the view  to get your popularity up  and keep it strong

[01:56:00]  what  I said Buffalo's  a rockin' today  yeah so what do you got Harry  uh  today's my  tell us about the discount  Harry  uh  found a friend  Harry  sorry a little inside  go ahead uh  Harry  like to do a  bi-  bi-  whatever that  laugh is  uh  diabolical laugh  that's it  diabolical laugh  alright  I'd like to give a quick shout out  to my nephew Brian  first he's driving to work  so here we go boys  whoo-ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha  whoo-ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha 
[01:56:30]  whoo-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  rip it rip it  hey listen  that was um  that was very doctor evil  yeah let's go to Dave  from the NYPD  Dave what's up  how you guys doing today  hey there Dave  we're doing alright  well I'll tell you  I uh  I've been listening to you guys  and  you're running on the head  with that  the problem with  what's going on today  is that  they're trying to prosecute  these guys  and we need to have them  prosecuted in the federal court  so we get the death penalty  yeah  you kill a cop 
[01:57:00]  you should be prosecuted  in federal court  and have the death penalty  Bloomberg's taking that  Ronald Wilson  Ronald Wilson  was prosecuted  and they gave him  the death penalty  if you go through  it's all kinds right now  they need to let  this go to the federal court  absolutely  well the mayor  already saying  we don't need to do that  so  there you go  let him stick to his stupid  city  pay to get into the city plan  leave the laws  and the murderers 
[01:57:30]  to the judges  and the court system  he's not a conservative  anyway  he's probably  against that penalty  hey um  I got an instant feedback  from a cop  he said  when they were like  investigating the crime scene  of the cop killing  you know  the guys on scene  like investigating  were getting pelted by rocks  from the roofs and stuff  yeah  that'll happen  I don't know if I can confirm it  but this guy's  speaking out today  it's happened  and that's documented  stuff that's happened  I don't know in this case  but 
[01:58:00]  that was happening  yeah  it just  it surprises me  that there are so many people  that are just begging  to have the cops  come into their neighborhood  when something bad happens  like somebody gets killed  but then when the cops  are doing routine patrols  in the neighborhood  so  maybe they could  head off somebody  getting killed  they are  called racists  they're  saying they're profiling  they're  hassling people  in the community  they're supposed  to be mind readers 
[01:58:30]  I guess  and as they're  driving down the street  know  who is going to be  killing somebody  and arrest them  because the second  somebody gets killed  then the police  are to blame  for not being there  and taking care  of the situation  because they don't like  coming into the neighborhoods  they're racist  all that  all that crap  but  when they come in  they're just crucified  for being there  and now they're  erecting  watchtowers  and now they're  mad at that  yeah  they look like  guard towers  but the reason 
[01:59:00]  the guard towers  in some of these  neighborhoods  is because  they're kind of  scared to be on the street  the cops want to be  20 feet in the air  in a bulletproof box  they're trying to be  higher than the roof  so they can feel safe  yeah  well how about this  the cops should want  to go into those  neighborhoods  because you want to  go where you can't  do anything right  if you arrest somebody  you're a racist  if you question it  or if you don't  you're just going to  get pelted with rocks  from the rooftop  that's healthy  that's good  and then if you  shoot a perp  that's good  then you're guilty  of racism 
[01:59:30]  for shooting  the person  and if you don't  shoot them  then they  go on to  maybe kill someone  in the neighborhood  and then again  you're to blame  because you weren't there  I don't know  how they do it  these cops  I don't know  how the hell  they do it  why would you want  that job  my god  we're in a speed round  here  they exhumed  the word  in Providence  Rhode Island  have you heard  about this  professor dude  professor dude 
[02:00:00]  that's a funny name  for a professor  by the way  it's coming in  on instant feedback  the word of the day  is exhumed  the long time  chairman  of the Roger Williams  University Board  admitted Monday  to using  oh do you have  like Dr. Evil  music over there  Anthony  let me see  hold on  alright I'm sorry  I should have  had you get all set up there  well that ain't it  I need that one  you got it  alright let me start over  yes  the long time 
[02:00:30]  chairman of the  Roger Williams University  Board  admitted Monday  to using  the N word  damn you're kidding  during a board meeting  saying  it kind of  slipped out  oops  hey  that could have  that could have  been accented  how can it  how can it  kind of  slip out  kind of  slipped out  and then he goes on  I apologize for that  Ralph  Papito said in the interview  on WPROAM  what else could I do  kill myself 
[02:01:00]  Papito 80  who stepped down  earlier this month  after nearly 40 years  on the board  admitted he had used  the racial slur  at a May meeting  of the school's  board of trustees  how did he use it  I want to know the  sentence  I don't know  I'd love to know  if it was a preposition  or a noun  or a verb  did he put ing  after it  yeah there's so many  unanswered questions  somebody was behaving  a certain way  is it an adjective  for rigged  yeah  he had been discussing  the difficulty  of finding blacks  and other minorities 
[02:01:30]  to serve on the  16 member board  which at the time  included 14 white men  and 2 women  Barbara Roberts  then a board member  said Papito  became irate  when he discussed  pressures to make  the board more diverse  at one point  using the slur  to refer to black  candidates to the board  oh boy  she said he then  told the board  he knew he couldn't  say that because  of Don Imus  because of Don Imus  that's the only reason  yeah  he gives  oh you know  that Don Imus  after he said that  there was like  this complete  and utter silence  and I was shocked 
[02:02:00]  beyond belief  and very angry  Robert said  Papito  who has given  the school  at least 7 million dollars  wow  and whose name  is on the only  law school  in Rhode Island  said he had  never used  a term before  and this is  where it gets  a little shaky  the first time  I heard it  heard the word  was on television  or rap music  or something  he told WPRO  something tells me  maybe he's fibbing  a bit there  if you've given  7 million to this  school  you should be able  to name one  of the buildings  that  you want to call 
[02:02:30]  it what hall  you'll hurt me  I have to get  over to  Paul  that's right  I'm late  it's okay  they expect it  oh  what too far  Papito said  Monday that his  decision to step  down for the board  was based on his  age and his  desire to spend  more time with  his family  he denied a  newspaper report  that he was  forced out  over the racial  epithet  racial epithet  let's say 
[02:03:00]  hi to Stephen  Buffalo  Steve what's up  but what  Buffalo  hold on  mark it down  new record  three phone calls  from Buffalo  in one morning  wow  and by the way  can I point out  congratulations to  everybody listening  on the edge  one board member  wanted the guy's  name to be removed  from the Ralph  Pepito School of Law  he gave 7 million  dollars  and they want his  name taken off  the law school  building  because he said  the n word  yeah 
[02:03:30]  and meanwhile  who's that guy  who teaches  for a cooney  oh boy  or is it  Sunni he works  for that black  oh god  how do I  yeah just  hate speech  oh he does  that's it  hate speech  about Whitey  being the devil  I always forget  his name  Jimmy  I'm sorry  Leonard Jeffries  I use a certain  yeah very good  I gave him  a different name  yes  shorter  easy to remember  let's say hi  to Stephen  Buffalo  Steve  hi guys  it's actually

[02:06:00]  it was fight  night at an LA  comedy club  last week  when John  Lovitz  roughed up  Andy Dick  over the  murder of  their Saturday  night live  colleague  Phil Hart  it's a murder  so this has  been brewing  for a while  huh  oh yeah  laugh factory  owner Jamie  Masada  who we know  who witnessed  the assault  said John  picked Andy  up by the  head  and smashed  him into  the bar  four or five  times  and blood  started pouring  out of his 
[02:06:30]  nose  Lovitz  told page  six  all the  comedians  are glad  I did it  because this  guy is a  blank hole  wow  good for him  Lovitz and  Dick have been  at loggerhead  since a 1997  Christmas party  at Hartman's  house  five months  before his  troubled wife  Brynn  flipped out  fatally shooting  Hartman  then killing  herself  Andy was  doing cocaine  and he gave  Brynn some  after she had  been sober  for ten years  what a  scum  what a  how do 
[02:07:00]  you do  that  technically  look  I mean  I don't  like Andy  Dick  I think  he stinks  but that's  her fault  for doing  it  I mean  look  he's a  scum  for giving  it to her  but look  you can't  blame anybody  but her  if she did  it  that's the  bottom line  even though  Andy Dick  should be  shot for  other reasons  because he's  just so  crazy  oh that  guy's  unpredictable  you ever  do coke  Jim  oh yeah  someone offers  it to you  no I wouldn't  take it now  no no I mean  not now  but I mean

[02:08:00]  given  Brennan  that cocaine  is that  a thank  you  yeah  that's  what I'm  I was like  okay thanks  man  yeah basically  yeah he got  a really good  gig out of it  that was a  vicious  he hates  him  but that's  kind of a  weird comment  though  if you hate  him that much  why would  you do  the show  like you  know maybe  not do  news radio  and wait  for the next  opportunity  no he was  slamming  dick when  yeah I'm  sure he'd  rather had  his pal  around  last year  a drunken  dick  strolled  up to his 
[02:08:30]  table at  a go in  West Hollywood  rudely  downed his  guest peach  liquor drinks  and looked at  me and said  I put the  Phil Hartman  hex on you  you're the  next one  to die  I said  what did  you say  and he  repeated  I want  to punch  his face  in but  I don't  hit  women  you know  implying  that Andy  Dick  is a  bitch  how embarrassing  is it to be  beat up by  John Lovitz  I can't get  that out of  Andy Dick  is so  outrageous  isn't he  crazy he  just comes  up and  drinks all  the people's  your guests  drinks  wow these  guys  are  outrageous  yeah 
[02:09:00]  he's a  wild man  so funny  and unpredictable  he's like  Andy Warhol  this guy  when the two  ran into each  other at the  laugh factory  last Wednesday  I wanted him  to say he  was sorry  for the  Phil Hartman  hex  Lovitz told  us  first he  says I  don't remember  saying that  then he  leans in  and says  you know  why I  said it  because you  said I  killed  Phil Hartman  which I  never said  then he  asked me  to be in  his new  movie  I grabbed  him by the  shirt and  leaned him  over and  said I  don't want  to be in  your movie  I don't want  to be in  your life  I pushed  him against  the rail  then I  pushed him 
[02:09:30]  again really  hard  a security  guard broke  look it up  I'm not  proud of  it but  he's a  disgusting  human being  and  Dick's  weirdness  has been  well documented  last year  he licked  the faces  of Farrah  Fawcett  Carrie Fisher  and Patton  Oswalt  then groped  and bit  the hand  of Post  reporter  Mandy  Statmiller  at a  comedy  festival  taping  this is  why he's  such  a sissy  and a  phony  I would  love to  see you  lick  Suge  Knight's  face  stupid  yeah  go ahead  do that  Patton  Oswalt  and you  know  he's a  comic  and a  nice  guy

[02:17:30]  it was a movie  I did years ago  actually when I  first started  coming out to  Opie and  Anthony called  Errors Freaks  and Oddities  I had a very  small partner  and they asked  me hey could you  do a photo shoot  uh you know we  want to put it  like on the cover  whatever we want  to help sell the  movie but I  didn't realize my  boy I'm not the  star of the film  they did that gag  with you  yes but I  didn't know  I've seen them  do that with  like big Hollywood  stars that have  a cameo and  they or it's  before they get  famous and they  throw a picture  of them on the 
[02:18:00]  cover and  meanwhile they  they're on in  the movie for  two seconds  which is why  I've never  promoted it on  the show I  would have  promoted for  them if they  would have  just sold it  as hey I'm  one of like the  guys in the  movie and I  got a small part  and I would  have been honest  about it but I  would never try  to get  all right I  get it dude  we were excited  when it wrecked  you on New  Year's Eve get  a hold of  yourself I  have to have  my face on it  at least you  could throw it  out yeah but  congratulations  Jimmy that means  you're famous  yeah that is  that they're  using you to  sell a movie  that you're 
[02:18:30]  barely in no  it just means  that everybody  else is that  much less  famous they all  look up to  E-Rock they're  like do you have  an agent no it's  actually I would  have promoted it  as a film that I  had a small part  and you know just  hey watch if you  want to see me do  a small part where I  get slapped in the  face yeah  interrogation room I  just didn't like  the way they sold  it like it was my  movie yeah all  right there's the  answer JC in Idaho  that's right so  by Crooks starring  me and Brando's in  it shut up what  do you would you  expect Crooks with  me on the box what  were you thinking

[02:29:00]  hi love  that's it  no man  do you know  a diabolical laugh  starts slow  is comprised  of three  separate laughs  yes  each building  to that crescendo  of evil  in the last part  of the laugh  yeah  so you gotta do it  three times  starting low  getting a little higher  until it's just  diabolical  no  don't think you're  gonna do it 
[02:29:30]  yes he can  is that a new  nike hat  or did you just  watch the old one  it was the other  nike hat that i had  what are you  the fucking president  of toilet hats  incorporated  his hats come with  a mint  like a urinal cake  in the fucking brim  alright  think austin powers  you want someone  to try it on the  phones  you don't want  an austin powers  rip off  you don't want  a dr evil rip off  but that format  is the  diabolical laugh  yeah  go ahead there  e  let's say 
[02:30:00]  how to rhyme  in denver  sam's just laughing  at him  i love it  i've got a diabolical  laugh for you  do ya  i'm scared  alright  that's not bad  that wasn't bad  let's try  baltimore real fast  clutch what's up  hey i want to do a  diabolical laugh  alright show  eric how it's done  oh i like how he 
[02:30:30]  brought the third  one down a little  bit i expected him  to go up  yes and it went  down  very good clutch  very good  all right  well this is good  eric well first  eric and then we'll  move on to what you  got in front of you  eric  three times  all right pretty diabolical 
[02:31:00]  not bad  you better sit down  look a little woozy  face all red  it's all woozy  from  like a thermometer  he can laugh  but then he can't do  anything diabolical  for ten minutes  he's too tired  to plot the destruction  of the world  he has to nap  yeah he needs a nap  he's all dizzy  i'm going to destroy  the world 
[02:31:30]  when i get up  tell uh tell tim  to add that to the  sweeper  yeah that that one  belongs  yeah  congrats  what do we got  in front of us  well uh quickly  i i earlier um  spelt out my solution  looks too much like  american money  i'm sorry  it does  it does  but they're on their  way  but uh coke logic  made this up  uh earlier i spelt out  my solution for america's  problems with the world  and internally and  everything  and it's so easy  yeah make sure you  listen to the replay  if you didn't hear  it involves uh me 
[02:32:00]  taking complete power  for a little while  of the country  and just running it  and uh a few military  moves and we're set  listen to the replay  as opius pointed out  but um  see our money  is spread all over  the world  so foreign countries  are kind of holding  us hostage  by holding our money  china has a lot of it  so we have to do away  with the dollar  sorry  it's my rule  and i have suggested  that the cumia  replace the dollar  and uh coke logic  has made up a 100 
[02:32:30]  cumia bill  uh with my picture  on the front  strangely it seems  like he's gone back  to another time  to put some references  in on this bill  i see an eagle  standing on uh  perhaps my old  message board name  initials  and i'm wearing  a helmet  that is uh  very reminiscent  of a world war  ii helmet  worn by uh  one of the uh  axis uh  participants  and then there's 
[02:33:00]  just a kind of  a picture of me  on the side  it does look  too much like  american money  you're a little  this this was  quick and dirty  wasn't it there  coke logic  but it says  in cumia we trust  i like that  yeah that's good  i like the uh  the uh  the faint image  of you on the right  yeah that's good  that kind of gives  it that realism  of a bill  like you're  you're  are you ruling  i'm ruling  with a fist  right up the keister  i'm ruling  with it  yeah  there should be  some kind of a  cumia should be  like  she should be 
[02:33:30]  pronounced a little  different  cumia  cumia  yeah  i think there  should be two  dots over the u  without a doubt  oh i see what  you're doing  yeah  right  yep yep  yep  for the money  not the name  yeah  but that's the  first uh  try at the uh  and 100  they should be  uh no  cumia will have  different  like this is a  67 dollar bill  is that how it is  so it's very odd  and very hard  to uh  uh  do transactions  with  outside of the  our country  five  court  narks 
[02:34:00]  equals  one  cumia  and with a  court  nark  you can  buy  nothing  but a  genital  wart  idea  just went  off in my  head  what's the  strangest number  you know  tuesday  no  no  i'm not even  sitting for  that  absolutely  all right  so we got  jared and  brian here  and they  went on the  streets of  new york  jared  uh  they buried  the n-word  so why not  bury the c-word  so you got  some you got  some bitches  right  yep  you talked to  some bitches  about this  some bitches

[03:36:00]  they call me cream pie jones  yes that line of the day  a runner up  absolutely  alright  I got to write that down too  I can't forget that one  didn't realize that the ONA show  was in competition with Ron and Fez  well  there are certain competitions going on  the Dave and  Shithead competition  but  look 
[03:36:30]  hold on a minute  one competition  I know we win  is listener rumble  yeah  our listeners  would beat the living shit  out of Ron and Fez's listeners  but whose side like  is Fred from Brooklyn on  that's  that's the deciding  well that's why  they'd have to decide  he started with us  way back in the N.E.W. days  but I hear him on Ron and Fez a lot  if he's on their team  it could be a little tough  it would be like the Civil War  brother against brother  they'd have to decide sides  they'd have to like  pick which sides  they want to go on 
[03:37:00]  and brother would be  fighting against brother  in some respects  but I believe  our side would emerge victorious  and what about  Happy Typing Girl  at this point  she's got to say  she's a bigger Ron and Fez fan  yeah  Happy Typing Girl is  but  we lost her  we lost her  we're losing Big A  for the most part  we've lost Dr. Patty  yeah  cause we treat our  listeners like shit  and they treat them nicely  and we put shit on our staff  but that is also why  our audience would 
[03:37:30]  kick their audience's ass  yeah  is because we have trained  like junkyard dogs  yeah  and they have like  nice puppy dogs  that you can keep  around the children  and I'm not taking  this competition lightly  let me tell you something  Ron and Fez  mhm  we put shit  on our Jared's head  yesterday  alright  see  that's something  people are forgetting  that Trump's hot sauce  in the asshole  that Trump's hot sauce  in the asshole  dude  he picked up  a load of shit  that Jimmy  sprayed out of his ass  that looked like  Dinty Morse beef stew 
[03:38:00]  and picked it up  with his hands  that's right  right out of the toilet  why are we just  casually giving it  to Dave  I didn't see Dave  put shit on his head  not shit  I didn't see him  pick up a stewy shit  absolutely  game on  game on  game on  cream pie  Jones  versus Eastside Dave  I  definitely  game on  that's right  and  why is Casey  showing her muscles  we can't hit girls  Casey's hot

[03:59:00]  of duty  with a rubber  glove of course  because we  don't want to  touch it  and then  maybe draw  a target  on your face  with your nose  being a bullseye  or maybe your  mouth being a  bullseye  and then we  draw it at  and then we  lob the duty  nuggets into  your face  for points  I like dipping  nerf darts  or something  into liquid  shit  into duty  and piss  mixed together  either way  that's pretty
