<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show "Worst of 2009" broadcast opens with a segment focused on Bobo, a recurring caller, and his delusional belief that SiriusXM producer Christina is his girlfriend.  Numerous voicemails from Bobo, ranging from romantic declarations to increasingly desperate pleas, are played.  Christina, present in the studio along with hosts Sam Roberts and E-Rock, confirms Bobo’s persistent calls and his self-proclaimed relationship status.  The segment features fabricated stories of their relationship, including a planned Brooklyn wedding, and graphic descriptions of Bobo’s imagined sexual encounters with Christina, using highly vulgar language.  The hosts prank call Bobo, escalating their actions to shouting matches and playing music during their calls.  Bobo eventually joins the studio, leading to further discussions about his romantic plans, his numerous surgeries for hypospadias, and his desire to grow a mustache to impress Christina. The entire segment is filled with crude language and suggestive humor.

The show transitions to a discussion of the hosts’ first day in their new SiriusXM studio.  This involves using extremely long microphone cords to interact with other SiriusXM employees in the hallways, leading to a mix of friendly conversations and negative reactions from employees who cite Opie and Anthony's "bad rap."  The hosts’ acquisition of numerous flat-screen TVs is a point of contention.  Sam Roberts, using the extended microphone, interviews various employees, including an electrician, an imaging producer, and a mailroom worker.  The cleanliness of the studio bathrooms is discussed.  The Christian Bale on-set meltdown audio is played.  The hosts also read and perform a comedic reenactment of an angry message from fellow SiriusXM host Alex Bennett, who expresses displeasure about Opie and Anthony’s arrival and their abundance of televisions.  The segment ends with discussions about the SiriusXM kitchen amenities, past encounters with Kane, and plans for further antagonizing their colleagues.

The antagonistic relationship between Opie and Anthony and Alex Bennett continues to be a major theme.  They repeatedly mock Bennett for his age (around 70), perceived liberal views, and smaller studio compared to their own twelve-flat-screen setup.  Sam delivers an announcement about their superior studio setup to other employees.  This sparks further jokes and insults directed at Bennett, including descriptions of his physique.  Sam interacts with additional SiriusXM employees, gathering their opinions on the hosts’ arrival. The hosts discuss a planned "Wall of Sound" prank, which is later denied by management. A caller joins in insulting Bennett.  The hosts mention that Bennett's Wikipedia page has been updated with unflattering information.  A caller discusses rare movie memorabilia.  The show also features a segment detailing Anthony’s embarrassing experience taking a young woman to the emergency room where she was treated in the pediatrics ward.

The show delves further into Anthony's hospital visit, focusing on the awkwardness and humor of the situation.  The age difference between Anthony and his girlfriend is a recurring topic, along with discussions of the hospital staff's reactions and Anthony being perceived as a "creep."  O&A staff members offer their opinions. Primetime Sam Roberts summarizes the events.  Later, comedian Rich Voss is in studio.  He inadvertently reveals his password ("Comic630") on air, leading to listeners hacking his Twitter, Facebook, and potentially other online accounts.  His Twitter profile picture is changed to a photo of Jimmy Norton in his underwear, and his feed is filled with pro-other-comedians and "gay"-themed content.  Voss’s frantic attempts to regain control, and the ensuing comedic chaos, comprise the rest of the segment. The show concludes with a "Worst of 2009" closing announcement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello, this is Benjamin Linus from Lost.  You're listening to The Worst of, O.B. and Anthony, hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  It's the Worst of the Year 2009 Countdown for the O.B. and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  Well, it's another Bobo bit on the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  This one involves Bobo and what he thought to be his girlfriend, Christina.  Of course, Bobo, just a breakout star in 2009, and the Queen's Motor Inn was one of the most memorable topics of conversation.  The place where he wanted to bring the woman that he thought he was going to lose his virginity to. 
[00:01:00]  Lose his virginity? Didn't he have a more colorful way of describing it?  I'll say pee-diving is what he wanted to do.  We're an XL channel.  I don't use that language.  Okay.  You can if you want.  Okay, so for everyone else out there, Christina is a producer, a jack-of-all-trades kind of person here at SiriusXM.  She produces a few other shows.  I call her a jack-of-all-trades since she works in radio.  There you go.  That works, too. 
[00:01:30]  And every now and then she'd walk by our office and say hi.  And was it you that introduced her?  Yeah, I introduced her to Bobo, and I pointed out to Bobo that she was really giving him the look-over.  She was really checking Bobo out, which was a fabrication.  And from that point forward, Bobo developed this thinking that he and Christina would be dating.  I don't think he developed as much as he outright said they were dating and told her that. 
[00:02:00]  Well, she was a lucky girl, and unfortunately, Bobo's dreams never came true, but listen to him describe them right here.  As we recap the Bobo and Christina saga.  It's number 18 on The Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the worst of 2009.  We were going to move on, but Sam was able to get the voicemails of Bobo.  Yeah.  Trying to ask Christina?  Yeah, Christina.  Christina out.  Who works on a show called what?  Angels on Call.  How's that going? 
[00:02:30]  It's good.  Yeah, they're getting a lot of calls.  We're recording it.  Angels on Call.  Psychic, it gives you a little help.  Angels on Call.  We all need help sometimes.  Sam's getting Christina.  Oh my God.  Oh no.  Oh God.  Here she is, everyone.  Hi.  Hi.  Jimmy just farted.  Jimmy farted.  It's horrible.  He does it every time.  Bobo is under this impression that you are his girlfriend.  He apparently leaves voicemails. 
[00:03:00]  He does.  He leaves voicemails.  He calls me on a regular basis.  Now how did he get your number?  Can we back up though?  How did this whole romance start with you and Bobo?  God, Sam.  Sam was the matchmaker.  Oh, good old Sam.  Fucking Sam again.  Well, I just noticed the two of them kind of looking at each other one day.  Oh, he's so full of shit.  You're full of shit now.  Go ahead.  And she's blushing.  And so I introduced...  So are you.  I just have rosy cheese.  Yes.  I introduced... 
[00:03:30]  You might be blushing.  What's that about saying?  You really are.  Look, yeah, no, it's getting rosy.  Prince Harry.  A little rosacea.  It's probably because he ran down the hallway.  Yeah.  He's all flush.  Yeah.  It's because all you boys are looking at me.  That's what it is.  Go ahead.  But I introduced the two of them and they really hit it off.  I said that...  I told Bobo that I just noticed her kind of looking at him and then Bobo went over to  talk to her.  And I mean, from there, you know, the storybook romance writes itself.  They just...  Writes itself.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  And you see him chit-chatting in the hallways?  All the time.  Every Friday, they just talk and talk and talk.  What do you guys talk about?  He talks to me about the Nets.  Yes.  What?  He loves talking.  He wants to get married in Citi Field, but I told him I'm a Yankees fan, so he said  we'd meet in the middle and get married in Brooklyn.  It's a big deal.  Oh, wow.  It's a big deal.  How does that relationship...  You guys are all jealous.  Look at you.  All of you.  How does the relationship work with you being a Yankee fan and him being such a staunch  of a Mets fan?  Well, we're having some difficulties, apparently. 
[00:04:30]  That seems to be the biggest problem, right?  The biggest obstacle.  When he calls me and his mom yells at him on the other line.  Mom!  Please!  I'm trying to do this now!  I'm trying to do this now, Bob.  I'm trying to do this.  I have a girlfriend.  It breaks my heart.  It's a girlfriend.  I have...  She works at a Sirius XM satellite video.  About two weeks ago, we were sick of having Bobo around, so we told him to scram, and he 
[00:05:00]  said he was waiting for Christina, and Christina said, don't worry, Bobo.  I'll just meet you outside.  I just have something to do.  And guess what Christina did?  Ditched him.  Oh, yeah.  Took a helicopter off the roof.  I was working really hard.  I do a lot of things for here, and I was working really hard.  So how many times has Bobo called you?  I don't know how many times he's called me, but he's...  Can't count that high?  Yeah, no, but he's left me three messages.  And we got a couple of messages.  This is what we're getting at.  Yeah.  Bobo, and how many times has he officially asked you out? 
[00:05:30]  Well, he just asked me...  At first, he asked me...  I guess he told you guys that we've kissed, right?  I know that.  Yeah, yeah.  How is that?  And he said something along the lines of how he was going to go out with me that weekend,  and we were going to have sex, which I found to be hysterical.  He pretty much told you that that's what's going to happen.  Well, I think he also told people here.  That's what I heard.  Here's the thing about how big-hearted Christina is, that she doesn't want to take advantage  of this person, that Bobo has not asked her out more than once, because Bobo said, 
[00:06:00]  she's my girlfriend, and Christina said, yep, yep, I'm your girlfriend.  And just played him along.  So that's all.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  No, but he's called...  The 4th of July, he was all upset because we were going to Connecticut, and he wasn't  invited.  All right, he talked about that.  Yeah, he called about seven times that day.  He was very upset.  Hello.  I was just calling to see if you're back home.  I just wanted to see how you were doing, Christina.  Christina, it's Bobo.  Hi, and how's Connecticut?  Give me a call when you get home.  Oh, he's so sweet. 
[00:06:30]  Hello, Christina, it's been five minutes since my last call.  I wanted to know if you're okay.  I'm worried.  Give me a call back.  Beep.  Hello, I just realized you probably don't have my phone number.  Here it is.  Beep.  Well, at first, I gave him a studio line.  You gave him a studio line.  Because I wasn't near my phone, and then he called Garrett, looking for...  Young Garrett, yes.  Advice, I guess.  And then he called me, looking for a promotional code for his radio, which I can't help him 
[00:07:00]  out with at all.  Oh, my God.  He's doing favors and shit.  Oh, that is fantastic.  I think Garrett hooked him up with that, too.  And yeah, that's not something you can do my control.  Bobo's got a call.  Hello, Christina, I was in the shower.  I thought I heard the phone ring.  I guess not.  Okay, call me.  I love you.  You want to hear actual Bobo voicemails?  Yes.  Here's the first one.  Nothing more. 
[00:07:30]  I got those.  Turns out they were just Frank's phone calling me.  I got that taken care of.  Got that taken care of.  Just purposely wrote something in the wrong direction.  I don't think Sam's going to be Frank's phone calling me.  Yeah.  End of message.  He just says it like that.  The next one's better.  He says he loves me.  Yeah, I hear the next one's better.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's just a little quick one.  That's sexy.  I don't even know what he was trying to say there.  He was trying to...  July 4th at 1. 
[00:08:00]  15 p.m.  Eastern time.  Oh.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just wanted to know how everything was going with you during the week.  And hope everything's going good.  I'll see.  If I don't hear from you during the week, I'll see you the next time I'm in the studio.  Have a good week, and I'll see you then.  See you then.  I love you.  Bye.  Oh, he slipped that in.  End of message. 
[00:08:30]  See you then.  I love you.  Bye.  Oh, I can't be part of this.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Isn't it so sweet?  I can't be part of this.  Oh, that's so sweet.  It breaks my heart.  Isn't that sweet?  Oh, God.  Of course I can be part of it.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm here.  I'm here.  Hi, Bobo.  Hi, Bobo.  We got Christina in studio.  How's everything going?  It's going well.  How about yourself?  Let these two lovebirds talk a little bit.  You would have enjoyed it at Smithtown.  I would have enjoyed what?  No, you would have enjoyed the trip to my uncle's house. 
[00:09:00]  He's got a great place.  Uncle's house in Smithtown.  That's where I wanted to take you.  Oh, okay.  You didn't tell me that.  It's a great place.  Everybody's here is funny.  All my relatives are freaking hilarious.  Yeah?  Yeah, they all believe me.  My uncle Mike, he's always been an interesting character.  Mike?  So what's going on, Bobo?  He shot a cup once in the Italian mystery.  I'm not even quite sure what I'm doing this weekend.  Oh, really?  Well, Bobo, ask her out. 
[00:09:30]  She's right here.  Oh, Bobo.  Jesus.  Get down.  Well, I haven't made any plans.  I don't even have tickets to the game.  Is that a hint for you guys?  Bobo, if I had tickets, you'd be invited.  I told you, Bobo.  I'm a Yankee fan.  We have to go to the Yankees game.  Well, if I had tickets for that, I'd probably.  I wouldn't mind if you go with me to Michigan.  I'll go with you.  I'll go with you to the Yankee Stadium. 
[00:10:00]  Bobo.  Bobo.  Weekend is here.  Like, make it up as you go along.  You got her here.  This is an opportunity.  Your weekend's free.  Make up a date right here on the spot and ask her.  Well, maybe if it's possible, you could go to FH Riley's with me.  Where's that, Bobo?  I don't know where that restaurant is.  I think it's, what, 400 New York Avenue?  Thank you, man.  Heart of Huntington Village?  Yeah.  I know how to get there if I know how to get there from Huntington Station.  Oh, because you've got to take the train.  Oh, so you've got to take Christina on a train to Huntington Station.  Oh, man.  Great. 
[00:10:30]  Bobo, do you mind if I take Christina to a Yankee game?  That I have to do.  That I would have to do the honors.  No, no.  Like, do you mind if you, you know, if we just go to a Yankee game?  Because I could get Yankee tickets pretty easy.  And she's a Yankee fan.  I'm a Yankee fan.  We could drive in.  It's not like we have to take the train or anything.  And I'm just thinking I think we'd have a good time at the Yankee game.  Would you mind if I did that?  No, I think I know where this is going. 
[00:11:00]  You're trying to make moves on her.  Am I?  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  This is too smart.  Sharp as a tack, this kid.  Really.  I'm listening to the show.  I'm listening to the show, guys.  Oh.  Well, Bobo, you better step in here because Ant's moving in a little bit.  I find her very attractive.  She is.  She's very cute.  Now he's threatening me with mobsters, I think. 
[00:11:30]  I want to hear about his connections in the Bronx.  Yeah, what's your connections in the Bronx?  I got some friends out there.  What kind of friends?  What do they do?  It's just the people I do way back.  Are they going to harm Anthony in any way?  Yeah, what's going on?  Are you threatening me?  No, they're not going to harm Anthony, but they're going to harm you.  They're going to chop my head off and put it in a freezer or something. 
[00:12:00]  But they would let me know what's going on.  What?  Are they going to follow me?  Oh, they're going to...  Okay, I see.  No, no, no.  I'm saying they could probably easily probably try to get tickets and try to get a glimpse  of what's going on.  All right, Bobo.  Here's the deal.  Ant's ready to ask her out for real.  Okay.  Now, here, it's Friday.  The weekend is upon us.  Make up a date right now and ask her.  Yeah, well, this...  How about this Saturday? 
[00:12:30]  I think it's early.  Bobo, it's really short notice.  I told you last Friday.  You can't ask on Friday to do something on Saturday.  You know what I mean?  You've got to catch me in the beginning of the week.  I'm a busy girl.  Hey, well, I could always call you in the beginning of the week.  Yes.  You could do that, yeah.  I could always do what you just said.  I could call you in advance.  I could call you in advance.  Yeah, you have to do that because, you know, weekends, they fill up quick sometimes.  Troy Kwan reminded me that last week, after the show, we asked Bobo if he ever thought 
[00:13:00]  about Christina in private, which then prompted Bobo to take a picture of Christina with his  cell phone and then let us know that he was going to use that to masturbate.  To J-O.  To J-O.  He'll be J-O-ing.  J-O.  Christina, move the microphone because everyone wants to picture you.  Ant's new girlfriend, give us a nice look here.  My new girl?  Jesus.  Hold on, man.  You certainly are.  There you go. 
[00:13:30]  You certainly are jumping to conclusions.  I might just have to challenge you to a round of Midnight Club.  Oh!  Is there going to be a duel or something?  Midnight Club.  He wants to play Midnight Club.  Nice.  On Xbox?  Riverwind's get there.  He's just auctioning you off for the best gamer.  It's the remake of The Getaway, that famous scene.  Right, yeah.  It's a fair competition.  Whoever wins gets her, no harm, no harm.  Sure. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, she has no say in this there, Bobo?  Exactly.  Yeah, Bobo.  Should I stand there with the flag?  Yeah, what are you guys, gladiators?  She's a girl, you know?  She's a person.  You can stand in front of two guys with their video game controllers.  I've never been more turned on.  Two guys duking it out on the video games.  Yeah.  So sexy.  For your honor.  I'll wear a Mets hat and throw my feces at you.  I am the man who will play a video game for your honor.  I am your hero. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  I scored 1,500 on centipede.  Let me eat your ass.  You had to take it there, didn't you?  Why wouldn't he?  Why wouldn't he talk?  I'll bring in a checkered flag for this.  All right, with the checkered flag.  That was worth interrupting all the big laughs in Jimmy's line.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  Jesus. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God.  It's fantastic.  We'll play a game of checkers, and if I get my piece to the other side, you could  king me with your mouth on my cock.  King me.  All of the visuals.  All of the visuals.  King me.  King me.  You could king me with your mouth on my cock.  Oh, Bobo.  Bobo.  You still didn't really ask her out.  What's your dream day with Christina?  That's a good question.  That would be somewhere at a, I don't know, at this little place I live in Woodside called 
[00:15:30]  Donovan's Pub.  Oh, Donovan's Pub.  You want to get me drunk, Bobo?  Oh, man.  Well, it's a little place in Woodside.  I grew up in Woodside.  So what's it?  Woodside.  What's so special about Donovan's in Woodside?  Woodside.  It's so simple.  There's one thing, beer and a burger.  Oh.  Wow.  That's pretty easy.  Can it be a cheeseburger?  That's extra. 
[00:16:00]  By the way, those burgers are huge.  You got to have the stomach for it.  They're huge.  You have to have a what for it?  The stomach for it.  Oh, that's good.  So you're telling her she's got the stomach for huge burgers?  Oh, man, Bobo.  This is not looking good for you if you say things like that.  No, you got to have the appetite for it.  Like, you got to be hungry.  Wow, that's good.  I really know about it.  I'd lock you in my basement for a week prior to our date.  You really know a lot about dating.  Yeah.  Girls love to just chow down on their first date.  Yeah, that's all they do is eat like pigs. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's what they do.  The burgers are so good, they give you toilet paper with them because you're probably going  to do shit right there at the table.  Oh, God.  My enchanting dinner date for the evening.  It's not like they just nibble a little bit.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Way to know women, Bobo.  You got to wait almost a year for them to fucking show their true side with their eating  habits.  Yes.  All right, Bobo.  So you do a burger and a beer, but then what?  You can't spend the whole night at Donovan's.  Oh, I got a Queen's Motorin' Connections. 
[00:17:00]  What?  What?  I got Queen's Motorin' Connections.  Queen's Motorin'?  Oh, my God.  Burgers, beer, and then the Queen's Motorin'?  That's hilarious.  This guy is a gem.  He's got connections, though.  I got connections at the Queen's Motorin'.  Yes, there's a crack, a transsexual crack prostitute named Cookie who allows me to use  her room while she's shooting up outside. 
[00:17:30]  Bobo, what am I going to say?  I only have to pay for ten minutes instead of an hour.  Yes.  Yeah, is this room by the hour, or are we spending the night?  Yeah, what's going on there, Bobo?  Yes, bed bugs and quick coming.  And do they have HBO?  Bobo, gaseous, gaseous shitburgers at the Queen's Motorin'.  We can get you an orange slice and I can fuck you in the crack vials and the bad rug.  Go ahead, Bobo, what?  I know you're doing my uncle.  To your uncles? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know if I'm ready to beat the family yet, Bobo.  Yeah, Bobo, what's a big step?  That's pretty quick.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's ask Bobo, though.  What goes on at the Queen's?  Oh, fuck.  I forgot.  Jesus Christ.  His uncle in Smithtown, of course.  Jesus Christ.  So, Bobo, what were you saying?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Talk about your connections at the Queen's Motorin', and have you been there before?  You know, I just had to drop stuff off with my uncle, who works there.  Oh, your uncle works there.  Oh, he works there.  Okay.  Oh, that's your connection. 
[00:18:30]  Why would you go there, Bobo?  I'm not comfortable with that.  He's going to think I'm a whore.  Yeah, yeah.  That's really not a good first impression.  But let's hear what this...  Bobo, Queen's Motorin', go.  What's that about?  What do you want to do with Christine at the Queen's Motorin', in this fine neighborhood?  Yeah, what do you want to do with it?  Yeah, let's get into this a little bit.  Come on.  Oh, I see you, I...  Oh!  See you, I...  What?  I say I eff her.  Eff her?  He just said I eff her.  Did you say eff me?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  You'd eff her?  In what way?  In what way?  Well, what's your move, Bobo?  Come on.  Let's get into this a little bit.  She seems a little...  She has a little smile on her face.  Let's...  I don't know if I've got a move.  Bobo likes strap-ons.  Bobo, you like strap-ons?  No, I said...  No, I said I've watched girls with, you know, go at each other with those.  Yeah, he doesn't like men in the porno. 
[00:19:30]  No.  And he can't place himself there.  We had this conversation already.  You ought to go on a double date with Jodie Foster and Travis Bickle.  Oh, this just in from Cigars and Scotch.  Good news.  Bobo's able to crayon her in for next week.  Bobo, what's your move?  You're in the Queen's Motor Inn now.  What's up?  Let's go.  All right.  I bring her up to the room.  What?  I bring her up to the room.  Okay. 
[00:20:00]  Bring her up to the room.  And I guess I'd, uh, I guess I'd, uh, I guess I'd, uh, I guess it's slowly, uh, removed from the start.  So, I guess I'd lay down on her first.  I guess I'd lay down on her first.  So, while she's watching TV, maybe.  No, no, no, no.  I think he said something else.  What did you say?  What did you say?  Go down.  Go down.  Oh.  Oh, oh, I thought you were just.  Pay attention, boys.  Oh, he's a lot more classy than I had him.  What part of, uh, her body would you spend the most attention on? 
[00:20:30]  No, no, no.  I'd go pussy diving.  What?  I'd go pussy diving.  I'd go pussy diving?  So, you want to go have a burger and then take her to the Queen's Motor Lodge for some pussy diving?  A burger, Jimmy.  A, a, a, a huge burger.  Yeah.  With cheese.  That's where he goes in the shallow end off of the little diving board.  Pussy.  At the pool at the Queen's Motor Inn.  A big, huge burger that will get the gases going.  Then he goes to the Queen's Motor Inn and he's going to do a little pussy diving. 
[00:21:00]  Some pussy diving.  Sounds like a typical first date.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  This sounds great.  All right.  I know.  He's better than I am.  I would have cut the whole burger out of the scene.  At least he's giving you food.  And the motor in.  Yeah.  Jesus would have been in the passenger seat of the Beamer.  Bobo, what's your, what about when the check comes?  Ah.  Ah, very good.  How do you handle that?  Do we go Dutch or is that all on you?  That would be, that would be, that would be on me.  Yeah?  Even the tip?  Hmm.  Uh, that, that would depend on how much money I bring at the moment. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  All right, Bobo.  We got the burger.  We got the Queen's Motor Inn.  We got the pussy diving now.  Now what?  How does this lovely evening end?  Yeah.  What happens?  Well, does it end in the evening or does it end in the next morning?  In the morning.  Right.  Right, right.  That's why he always has a new one.  I love it.  This is better than the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  What?  It could end of the daytime.  Oh.  All right.  You're done with the pussy diving. 
[00:22:00]  Then what?  Walk us through it.  Let's get to the end of this date.  Come on.  Come on.  You know, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll go, I'll start, go, go up on her.  Oh, it's a safe, she'll be it.  Don't be intelligent going on.  Don't be insertion going on.  Wow.  Slick talker.  Wow.  Now, uh, uh, this is very important, Bobo.  Do you, do you practice safe sex?  Good question.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Oh, yes, you do. 
[00:22:30]  How, exactly?  By not showing up for the date.  That's the safest.  What do you, Bobo?  What, what is it rubber?  What would you like her to do to you?  Oh, that's fair.  That's a good question.  That's fair.  A little reciprocation.  You've been, you've been.  I can't be selfish about it.  Well, no.  Oh, okay.  Bobo, you gotta, you gotta make moves to get there.  You don't just start doing that. 
[00:23:00]  So what are some moves that you would make to try to get that going on?  Oh, no.  Yeah, you shouldn't just dive right into my pussy.  That's not a good idea.  Yeah, you might hurt her.  Diving.  Dog shit sniffer gets...  Do a cannonball.  Dog shit sniffer from one side.  Of course, the bartender of Donovan's writes,  Fuck the Queen's motor and he can bang her in my face.  I've never felt so classy in my life.  It's just fantastic to apologize.  I love you.  A night with Bobo. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I know.  This is very romantic.  It really is amazing.  It's shaping up to be a pretty nice date.  I'm loving this.  But Danny has a good question.  What are some of your moves to get there?  I'm not sure.  I've never done this before.  Well, you're going to have to.  Wait, would I be your first?  Yep.  That's a lot of pressure.  Bobo, you've seen movies and television.  I mean, I'm sure you could probably learn and grab from some of those experiences.  So, I mean, what kind of moves would you make?  What would you try to do?  Let's just get you started. 
[00:24:00]  You hope.  I guess we'd probably make up with her.  Yeah, but you've got to get to that point.  Let me help you out for two seconds.  You crack that door open with that wonderful key with the big plastic room number hanging on it.  If found, please return to.  Yeah, just drop in mailbox, post-it, guaranteed.  And you go, hey, you know, come on in.  And now you shut the door.  You're both standing in the wonderful accommodations of the Queen's Motor Inn. 
[00:24:30]  Now what do you do?  You're both just kind of standing there.  I don't make my move on her.  I don't make out with her.  I do the old reach around.  The reach around?  What the fuck?  You're making out with her.  So you just automatically start kissing her the second the door closes to the room.  What are you reaching around to?  No, I don't.  I don't.  I don't.  First, you get on the bed.  First, you say get on the bed.  Then we would fill out postcards and send them to loved ones. 
[00:25:00]  No, I don't.  Dear family, my travels have probably 10 days of Motor Inn.  Wish you were here.  I'd remove your shirt.  Why would you remove the shirt?  That's a little weird.  Wait, whose shirt?  My shirt or your shirt?  Yeah, whose shirt?  Oh, clearly.  Yours is coming off.  And why would you remove her shirt?  Obviously, to use the complimentary iron.  No, no, no, no.  This is sounding more like an abduction and rape than a date. 
[00:25:30]  Bubba, why would you remove her shirt?  I'd remove mine as well.  I'd remove my stuff as well.  Now, why are you taking her shirt off?  Are you a fan of her boobies?  Yeah, of course.  It's got to make sense.  It's a class act.  All right, then what?  It's got to make sense. 
[00:26:00]  All right, we heard that.  We get it, Bubba.  Yeah, I'd pull over stuff and I'd go down on her.  What's your technique like, Bubba?  Yeah, how do you do that pussy diving thing?  Well, it's like the triple Lindy.  I guess, I guess, I don't know how to describe it, right?  Well, try.  No, I don't know.  I guess, I guess, I don't know. 
[00:26:30]  Just dive right in.  Dive right in.  Dive right in.  That's what, that's how you do it.  Well, you have to be careful when you're down there.  Yeah.  You do know that you're supposed to, like, just jab your tongue right in there, right?  Your stiff tongue over and over again, violently.  I guess I guess I go lightly at first.  Oh, lightly at first.  All right, lightly.  And then gradually.  Okay.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Well, this sounds like a lot of fun, Bubba.  Yeah.  Sam, Bubba, what do we got?  Well, he was leaving voicemails for Christina when we last left him.  You know, we talked to him last week.  Now, Christina's his girlfriend.  She doesn't know this, but in Bubba's eyes, he's all in, and this is his girlfriend.  He says, I love you and everything.  Yes, they're in love with each other.  If you ask Bubba, they're very much deeply in love with each other.  Yeah.  Very committed relationship. 
[00:27:30]  However, she is not returning his phone calls.  Oh, no.  But, lucky for Bobo, this does not deter the voicemails.  Really?  So, he was calling her all week long, and we basically, we found out that on Saturday,  or Saturday and Sunday, he was calling her during the weekend.  So, Danny, Travis, and I decided that that would mean that we should call Bobo every day  from the office.  So, you've been calling Bobo every day.  Yeah, and at first, it was just a very, like, let's just, you know, we were just messing 
[00:28:00]  around, so we don't have all the prank phone calls on tape.  Okay.  Like, in the beginning, we just, like, dialed Bobo's number without any real plan, and Danny  just started shouting, stay away from my fucking girlfriend.  Shouting isn't even the word.  Like, you know, if you're going to do something like that, you have to go all in, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So, I'm, like, screaming, like, I'm, like, I'm banging the desk.  I'm just, like, like, why the fuck are you calling my girlfriend?  Why the fuck are you calling?  And, like, what I found out later on was, like, the entire floor stopped and was, like,  well, wow.  We had the door of our office shut. 
[00:28:30]  And they still could hear this.  And down the hall, they were, like, dude, what's going on?  So, they're convinced that someone, you're really pissed at somebody out there.  I just, I had to stop, I'm sorry, I had to text her.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, just texting her, saying hi.  That's all.  Yeah, there's a little, there's a little contact between, uh.  Yeah, just, you know, a little text.  And Bobo's girlfriend.  That's my girlfriend.  That's it.  I will take you to a medscape.  And we will then go to the, yeah, I like the other one. 
[00:29:00]  We learned Bobo, like, when he has to talk about, like, uncomfortable stuff, his voice gets  real hot.  His voice gets high, he makes two little fists and shakes him.  Yeah.  He, uh, I didn't know, I never saw what he looked like, or I didn't remember, at least.  And he, he was coming and he was fucking with E-Rock.  He was.  Bobo.  Yeah, E-Rock, why did you, why did you buy Troy Breakfast and not me, E-Rock?  And he kept doing that.  And E-Rock's going, I fucking hate this mother.  And I go, who the fuck is this guy? 
[00:29:30]  He got working for the show.  He's a fucking moron.  And he goes, that's, that's Bobo.  And I go, oh, Jesus Christ.  That's Bobo, all right, now we go.  So, E-Rock, uh, E-Rock paid for somebody's breakfast and not mine, so somehow Bobo got  the idea that he should constantly walk into E-Rock's office asking, well, how come he's  buying breakfast?  We're going to get Bobo on a little later, because we're going to play these, then we're  going to get Mary Carrey in, and then we'll do a little Bobo.  But, uh, should we start, start with the voicemails that Bobo is, uh, leaving for Christina?  Yeah, start with the voicemails.  All right, so here's, uh, one of many.  That's fantastic. 
[00:30:00]  Remember, Bobo is convinced they're going out.  Yeah, I think.  Christina, I mean, you know, is, like, no fucking way.  But she's trying to be a little politer than that.  Yeah, she's got a big heart.  Oh, Mary's not here?  No.  You know, if she's late, then fuck it.  I mean, for real, fuck it.  She could lick my balls.  Yeah, I'm panicking to try to squeeze her in, and she's late?  Fuck her.  Now we try to squeeze her in.  Here's Bobo calling Christina.  Saturday, July 11th at 12.27 a.m. 
[00:30:30]  What?  So this is Friday at midnight at 12.30.  And Bobo is calling Christina.  Now, he does, though, have a very good reason for wanting to talk to her.  Like, what he's doing is definitely, like, topical and something that would definitely require a phone call.  It couldn't wait.  Exactly.  Yeah, okay.  Precisely.  Saturday, July 11th at 12.27 a.m. 
[00:31:00]  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just want to know how everything's going.  I'm just watching the season two of Lost.  And I know I've probably seen it a million times, but damn, that show gets better.  New season takes forever for the new season.  But just want to know how everything's going.  I want to hear from you during the weekend.  Hope you have a good weekend.  Love you.  So season two of Lost on DVD.  Because you can't wait for the new season to come out.  Right.  It's Friday.  So you went way back.  12.30 a.m. 
[00:31:30]  I wanted to see what you're doing.  Yeah.  I love it.  Love you.  Saturday, 12.25 a.m.  This is creepy.  And I think this next voicemail is another one from the weekend.  Okay.  Before Danny Travis and I caught wind of the situation.  How great is that?  Jesus.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Just wanted to know how everything's going.  You can call me back as soon as you get the chance.  Bye. 
[00:32:00]  Love you.  To love you is pretty pathetic.  Oh, boy.  I just texted her.  I said, hi.  She goes, how's it going?  I go, good.  Just talking about you and Bobo.  She goes, oh, yeah.  All good things, I hope.  I go, what could be bad?  Love you.  Bobo.  What are you doing?  You can call me back or I'll fucking kill you.  Bobo's going to kill me. 
[00:32:30]  I'm a little scared.  All right.  All right.  I see what you guys did here.  Okay, so the third Bobo voicemail to Christina is Sam.  Right.  Who set this up?  Yeah, we heard.  Now, Danny, Travis, and I heard these two voicemails.  Sure.  Yeah.  So we decided it's time to start calling Bobo regularly.  Now, we start calling him every day.  We call him every single day this week after the show, multiple times.  We also, around Tuesday or Wednesday, started calling him at 5 o'clock in the morning every day.  Oh, shit. 
[00:33:00]  So, basically, he started calling everybody.  He also called Garrett.  Everybody's phone number who he had at Sirius, he started calling and panicking because he didn't know at first what was going on.  He thought it might be you that were yelling at him and pissed off.  And why would I call him?  Because Christina don't think of him.  I don't think of him.  He's your girlfriend.  Yeah, because he's messing with your girlfriend.  Yeah.  So, this is Bobo's first voicemail to Christina after receiving all these phone calls.  Nice. 
[00:33:30]  Monday, July 13th at 11.07 a.m.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Could you find out what the heck is going on here?  I got a phone call, but I'm not sure if it's Danny or Anthony.  It was someone that sounded pissed off at me for some reason.  And I'm quite not sure why.  Or are they trying to prank me?  Or is this some sick prank they were pulling on me?  Let me know. 
[00:34:00]  He also has a tendency of trailing off.  Because I think he wanted to say I love you there and then realize maybe it's not appropriate.  Did you get these voicemails from the movie Happiness?  This is so tragic.  Click.  And then I think this last voicemail is later on this week after receiving.  We literally called this guy at least 15 to 20 times this week.  Jesus.  Sometimes we would just call and we'd put it on speaker every time. 
[00:34:30]  We would just dial his number and just wait and see how long he'll say hello before he hangs up.  Like I would just make armpit farts into the speakerphone.  I think there was one point where we just put it as a hip-hop song called Birthday Sex.  Yeah, we just played Birthday Sex.  Because I'll just sit there and listen.  We destroyed his world.  Yeah.  Hello, Christina.  It's me, Bobo.  Could you try to figure out what the heck is going on here?  Because I seem to be getting prank phone calls by Danny. 
[00:35:00]  Friggin' every time around the same time, the 11 o'clock hour.  Every single time.  I'm not sure if it's him trying to imitate.  I know it's him.  Probably I'm trying to imitate Anthony.  But could you figure out what the heck is going on here?  I'll see you on Friday.  Love you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Basically, after like five prank phone calls, I said, oh, shit, I have to start recording these. 
[00:35:30]  Because we were just doing it for our own amusement.  I realized, wait a minute, maybe I can bring this to the show.  Exactly.  So I just grabbed my, you know.  We tried to bring everything to the show, Sam.  Yes.  I just tried to grab my little flash recorder and just started putting the phone on speaker and just recording.  Okay.  So I think this one, by this point, he kind of has figured out that it's Danny.  Okay.  But.  Yeah, why are you calling my girlfriend? 
[00:36:00]  What are you talking about?  I'm with her.  Think it's fucking funny?  You calling my bitch?  I'm not.  I'm with her, Danny.  What are you talking about?  Hey, motherfucker.  You think it's fucking funny, motherfucker?  You think it's funny, motherfucker?  Imagine that amplified by, like, a hundred.  Yeah, that was, like, after I knew that, like, I had, like, freaked out the entire floor.  So, like, I had to tone it down.  But I was, like, the first few calls, I was screaming at the top of my lungs.  And then we just started having to think of creative ways to just ruin his world. 
[00:36:30]  So, like, I think this next one, we have, we've been trying to figure out how to get this song on the air for a long time.  It's by a rap artist named Chuggo.  Chuggo?  Yes.  Travis, Danny, and me love Chuggo.  The song is called Come On, Fucking Guy.  And so, we called Bobo and just left Chuggo playing.  Hello?  Hello?  Put a step in the place, throw your hands in the sky. 
[00:37:00]  Ah!  Come on, fucking guy.  On my way to the horn in the sky.  Hello?  Ah!  Come on, fucking guy.  My brothers in the can and won't get out till last July.  Ah!  Come on, fucking guy.  The people of shit.  That's how I feel.  I'll smash your fucking head.  That's how I feel.  And if you're a lead, that's what I do.  My son in the sky.  That's what I do.  Hello?  Bitch, you see the people of my head. 
[00:37:30]  Hi.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what is this all about?  I was scared out of his fucking mind there.  Because he didn't know.  He thought this was Danny pranking him.  Oh, wonderful.  But the things we were just doing were so...  There was no method to it.  It was unpredictable.  Insanity.  Just like...  God damn it.  Sometimes nothing would happen. 
[00:38:00]  Like, we would just call Bobo and just see how many times he would say hello.  Hello?  Before he comes out.  Hello?  We would call him at 5, 10 a.m.  And just not say anything.  I love you.  I love you.  Oh, Jesus.  And finally, you had intern David called Bobo.  Well, intern David, you'll see, is written in quotations.  Oh, okay.  Because that was actually Danny doing intern David.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Poorly.  Yeah, really?  Hello?  Hey, Bobo.  It's David.  What are you doing here, David? 
[00:38:30]  What's going on, David?  I mean, what's going on, Bobo?  How'd you get this number?  You gave it to me, Bobo.  Wait, wait, where are you going, Bobo?  Are you going somewhere fun?  Can I come?  I'm going to be there Friday, of course.  Whoa.  I heard you have a girlfriend now, Bobo.  Is she cute?  Yeah, believe me, she is. 
[00:39:00]  Can I put my cock head in her mouth?  No, I don't think so.  What about her ass?  Can I fuck her in the fucking ass?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, of course, I'm sure.  That's crazy, Bobo.  That's crazy, Bobo.  Why would it be that?  Whoa.  You sound a little bit weird.  You don't sound like that it did something a little bit odd about your voice.  No, no, it's Anthony, Bobo. 
[00:39:30]  You were Anthony?  Yeah.  Anthony White, I'll win at the price you were calling out of all people.  Now, stay away from my fucking girlfriend, you piece of shit.  Jesus Christ, man.  You guys are fucking brutal.  Oh, we fucked his world so bad.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah, that stung, man.  That's brutal.  Either Christina comes in here today, or Bobo goes and sees Christina live on our show. 
[00:40:00]  As she's doing her job.  Should we bring him in?  You want to?  Yeah.  I'll go grab him.  We really should.  All right.  Could you open up the fucking drapes to her?  God damn, man.  It's just brutal.  Dude, that was the...  Jesus Christ, man.  Poor motherfucker.  You've met Bobo, right?  I've met...  Well, no.  I just saw him today.  I haven't officially met him.  We talked to him on the phone last week.  Or two weeks ago.  I don't have to stare at that picture. 
[00:40:30]  I'm freaking tired of staring at that picture.  What's up, Bobo?  Hey, buddy.  I'm freaking tired of staring at that picture.  You're freaking torturing me here.  Well, you got...  Yeah, put the headphones on.  Are you growing a mustache?  Yes.  Of course.  Christina has a facial hair fetish.  Wait, you're growing the same mustache as Anthony.  He wants to grow the same kind of mustache.  No, I was trying to grow the Keith Hernandez.  We, uh...  The Keith Hernandez.  Why are you growing a mustache?  I'm so creeped out. 
[00:41:00]  Because she said she likes guys with facial hair.  Well, because last week or two weeks ago,  we went up to Bobo and with a Sharpie...  Drew a...  Yeah, thank you, Sam.  We went up to...  Sam moved the mic away from the heavy breathing Bobo.  We went up to Bobo and drew a Steve C. mustache  with a Sharpie on his face.  At which point, Christina, obviously speaking honestly,  said,  Oh, man.  You know, I love facial hair.  Uh-huh.  And so at that point, Bobo knew 
[00:41:30]  if he wanted to keep Christina,  he was going to need to grow himself a mustache.  He's got to grow a mustache.  Yeah.  We got to get to the bottom of this.  We got to get Christina in here.  We've never had both of you guys in the studio  at the same time.  We got to get to the bottom of this whole fucking thing.  Or were they in studio last week?  Yeah, not only that.  No, he was on the phone.  Not only even worse,  I'm freaking short on cash.  I freaking want to get this date to happen for once.  So what do you want to do?  Yeah, what do you want to do?  You still got the same plan of going to the Queen's Motor Inn?  I can't get the Queen's Motor Inn booked  because my uncle told me he's not able to arrange for that. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no, wait a minute.  So Queen's Motor Inn is out?  My Uncle Ray's always been a big disappointment.  Joe.  Yes, sir.  So for the first date, check this out.  Yeah.  You think you got game.  Bobo wants to bring Christina,  that hot piece of ass that works here,  for a really large oversized burger and a few beers  because girls eat a lot.  Down at Donovan's.  Down at Donovan's.  Yeah.  It's a happening place. 
[00:42:30]  Sounds like a great place.  In where?  Queen's?  It's in Woodside, Queen's.  Okay.  It's a happening place.  Okay.  Um, you know,  because girls love pigging out on the first date  when they really know you.  Yeah, why don't you take her to the old country buffet?  Right.  And then...  No, but these are freaking good burgers  they serve there.  And then he's going to move on  to the Queen's Motor Inn,  which we have a picture of on the door  because we're obsessed with the Queen's Motor Inn.  That's the Queen's Motor Inn.  Yep, that's it, all right.  I know it.  Bobo, the only burger on a first date  is a fur burger, my friend. 
[00:43:00]  Well, yeah, there'll be that  and there'll also be a fur burger,  but I don't freaking know what she looks like.  The fucking...  The Queen's Motor Inn  looks like the emergency room entrance  in an Oneonta hospital.  Like, it just looks like  a horrible institution.  That looks like the only people  coming out of it  are being shot at in a chase.  Well, I don't know about that,  but my uncle's heard noise  when he's had to deliver stuff  to those maids 
[00:43:30]  that clean up the hotel rooms.  Yeah.  He's heard noise.  He's heard noise.  Like what kind of noise?  No, like the sound of effing  going on in the rooms.  Is that the motel  from Sunshine Cleaners?  I'm talking about loud effing.  I'm talking about business transactions  with prostitutes going on in that place.  Wow, those are some strong allegations.  He has seen escorts walk  into that building.  How does he know they're escorts?  Why are you doing this to your uncle?  He can tell by the way they look. 
[00:44:00]  Because they come in often  with different guys.  Now, this is a lovely hotel.  After you pay Frank Whaley  for a room.  Then actually,  my uncle's boss  is named Jerry.  How much is it to stay there?  No concept of a joke.  That's what I love, Bobo.  Although he's funny.  You would think  he would have a concept.  Is that one of the escorts  walking in?  Juan?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's like Bobo.  Is that Bobo?  He's scoping the place out?  Bobo. 
[00:44:30]  And then tell Joe  what you want to do  with the Queen's Motor  and after you get her in.  No, after I get in,  maybe I'll let her  make the move.  I think it's only right  if I'm losing my virginity  and if the broad  has experience.  The broad?  You shouldn't be calling  anyone a broad  if you're a virgin.  Well, when I'm doing it  with her, he is.  Bobo, I'm going to give you  a tip, all right?  When you go to an establishment  like this,  you don't let the broad  make the move.  This is the kind of place  where you just start  masturbating in the corner  and hope she goes with it. 
[00:45:00]  But he said he's going  to do some of that.  That's a good pointer, man.  He said he's going  to do some pussy diving.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  I don't know.  Did I start with going  pussy diving her  or let her go down on me?  Nice.  Wow, what a choice.  Oh, jeez.  But there's no other choice  like this not happening?  Is there a third option?  Is there a third option?  Well, then he's going 
[00:45:30]  to get into some...  No, no, the other option  is just taking place  as she jumps out  for her life.  The other option  is just taking place  at her house.  Oh, now wait a minute.  Maybe it's her place.  Yeah, I think that'd be  a better choice  than the Queen's Motor Inn.  Giving her the home field  advantage, though.  Yeah, but I think  it'd be a better choice  than the Queen's Motor Inn.  Yeah, why is that?  I don't know.  A gutter would be  a better choice than the Queen's Motor Inn.  No, because I'm sure  she's got a much better place  than the Queen's Motor Inn.  Plus that, I've seen rooms  at the Queen's Motor Inn 
[00:46:00]  because one time  I had to go to the bathroom  and my uncle asked me  to deliver something to him  because he could not  leave his job.  He called me  and asked me,  he said,  I need pain medication  right now.  He injured himself  on the job.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He needs payment.  I don't know.  He injured himself.  I think it sounded like this.  I broke my knee, man.  All right.  I broke my knee, man.  He needs pain medicine. 
[00:46:30]  So he probably made  Bubba go up to East Harlem.  No, no, no.  I just went to the Queen's Motor Inn.  It's in Queen's Boulevard.  It's in Woodside.  Yeah, I was just going to say  this probably showing.  I just walked to the Q18 bus  and took the Q18 there.  Fucking joke out.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care about jokes.  That was funny, though.  Forget it.  It's over.  At least he approved.  I bet you 100 to 1  somewhere in that fucking place  there's a sign that says  don't piss in the elevator, please.  Please stop urinating 
[00:47:00]  in the stairwell.  That looks like a fucking  housing project.  I can't get over how  shitty this place looks.  Well, the Queen's Motor Inn  is a pretty cool place.  If you listen to the Laszlo show  this past Saturday,  Wayne, who is a co-host  on the Laszlo show,  talked about his days  at the Queen's Motor Inn.  Really?  When he would stay there  for three, four days  at a time freebasing.  Jesus Christ almighty, dude.  I gotta hear about this.  I was out at a block party  last week, so I was too busy  at a block party  listening to Laszlo's show 
[00:47:30]  drinking a couple of beers  with my friend  around the corner.  Oh, yeah?  Now, where was Christine?  Where was she during this?  I don't know.  All I keep getting  was that stupid answering machine.  Oh, boy.  I don't like talking  to answering machines.  When I call a customer  of service anywhere,  I want to speak  to somebody with a pulse.  You do like talking.  I mean, you said  I love you like four  or five times to a machine.  Yeah, you told the machine  that you loved it.  Yeah, but I'm not usually  good with answering machines. 
[00:48:00]  No, huh?  No.  How do you...  You haven't been out  with her on a date, right?  Yeah.  So how are you jumping  into I love you already  when you say goodbye  on the phone?  I've talked to her  and gotten to know her  a little bit.  So you know her enough  to know that you are in love.  Yeah.  I've talked to her.  She might be a Yankee fan,  but I have no problem  with Yankee fans, all right?  We share the same damn city  with them. 
[00:48:30]  So that justifies you saying  I love you.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then I've talked  to her a little better.  She's got a good sense of humor.  I asked her some of her  favorite comedians.  She's mentioned guys  that you guys have  on the show a lot.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I was talking to her  about Jimmy.  I've talked to her  about Bill Burr.  She loves the Jim Brewer show.  That was freaking...  What about Joe DeRozan?  Not so much.  I haven't asked her  about her yet.  I noticed...  About her?  About her.  There's only one problem 
[00:49:00]  I have with her Twitter.  What's that?  One of her Twitter people  she's following,  I saw Howard TV  on her Twitter.  Oh, no.  I have a problem.  If I hear she's took  off her top  on a Howard Stern show,  I might have to email  Howard Stern pictures  of my own junk.  You should do it.  That bombed.  Jesus Christ almighty.  I swear,  I'm actually gonna do that. 
[00:49:30]  I'm actually gonna take  a picture of my own junk.  Joe, would you like  to see his junk?  Your furniture?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I ain't gonna do that.  I'd look at his junk.  Yeah, we'd look at your junk.  If he took it out?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's very hairy.  It's hair.  All right.  You know what, though, Bobo?  I think we're onto something.  If you're gonna enter  into a date with Christina,  I think we need to take  a look at your junk  and give you some suggestions  because there's new  fucking styles out there.  Yeah, you might have  to groom it up a little bit.  Joe's up on the latest styles. 
[00:50:00]  I know one I would try to do,  but for obvious reasons,  after I've scored with her once,  I'll shave it.  Scored.  It's fucking hilarious  with the curtains  just immediately closed.  I know, it's not closing.  Bobo, make believe  it's a doctor's office.  A quick little dropping  of the pants.  Joe DeRose will take a look  at what you got.  I can tell you this is-  No, it's hairy!  We'll suggest a hairstyle.  This is why I hate  seeing a urologist.  This is why I've always hated  having urinary system problems  growing up.  You had urinary system problems?  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  I've mentioned it a lot of times  how much I hate it.  You got me too.  You probably had urinary problems  from sleeping at the  Queen's Motor Inn too much.  No, it's because  I was born with a condition  called hypospadias.  What's that?  Jesus.  It's urinary system problems.  That sucks, Bobo.  It means having trouble peeing.  Did you ever have  any surgeries or anything?  48 of them.  48?  Because there was problems  where they had to  do the operations in stages  where they had to repair.  I don't know how-  I don't understand. 
[00:51:00]  I ain't a doctor.  What?  I ain't a doctor.  What I do know is that  my mom knows about  the medical condition  better than I do.  Did you go to Dr. Screw?  No.  I went to a guy  by the name of  Dr. Kevin Burbage  at what was then called  Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.  It's now known as  New York Presbyterian.  Hey, Bobo.  Too many details.  Just don't mention any names.  Too many details.  Okay?  Don't mention any doctor names. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I mean,  if you want to trash your uncle,  who the fuck cares?  But some doctor that,  you know, you don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  So just, you know.  Well, I won't mention names,  but I'll mention it's now  known as New York Presbyterian.  Well, whatever.  See, even.  That's all right.  Whatever.  Like I said, no details.  We'll just keep any details away.  I just, I just know  to friggin' annoy me.  All right, Bobo.  And because of this,  there was actually  a lot of problems  where my pee hole  kept closing up.  Your pee hole or your pee hole?  You got a narrow urethra?  This just in.  We have a programming change  for 202. 
[00:52:00]  Uninformed has been canceled.  The Bobo Show  will be taking its place.  The Bobo Show.  I'll take that.  That's fair.  And what day is this  going to be on?  Go.  What happens when  your pee hole  closes up?  Yeah, what happens  when you put the earring back in it?  Bobo.  No, it ends up  getting smaller  and it's more difficult  to pee.  Bobo, I can't be  any more direct than this.  Show me your cock  right now.  Oh, come on.  All right, here you go.  Come on, help me out  with your big date.  That was a Jedi mind trick.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:52:30]  No, no, no, no.  It could be quick.  Just show Joe.  No homo.  Keep making that  noise while you do it.  See what I mean?  See what I mean  why I'm embarrassed  about this?  That is a Wookie.  You have Chewbacca  with a fucking  with an elephant trunk.  Well, very tiny one,  but I don't know.  I always thought of it  as Bin Laden's beard. 
[00:53:00]  It's like Bin Laden  eating a cocktail, Frank.  Wait a minute.  We just saw...  I can't even describe that.  The best...  We just witnessed  the best visual  for radio ever.  Him holding his pants down  and just going,  see why I'm embarrassed  with this thing.  You're not too...  That is a penis  that has been operated  on many times.  I've had so many operations 
[00:53:30]  and you know  the worst part  about being operated on?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  It's going to the bathroom  after they've removed  the cathra.  Yeah, cathra.  You have an idea  how burning,  that burning feeling  you get when you go  to the bathroom  after they've removed it?  Yeah, I've had that.  Yeah, but you've never...  I don't think you've ever  had an operation  on it.  No, no, thank God.  You know, not good.  No, no, you're lucky.  You've been born  with the cock 
[00:54:00]  of a black man.  Wow.  So I've heard...  Well, thank you, Bobo.  So I've heard...  That's what I've heard.  He just means it's brown.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I think I heard  it would make the...  It's what the Irish  claimed he had,  but he doesn't really have  because he's old ball bag.  He is old...  Wow, he remembers...  He's like Rayman  with his shirt, too.  He really is.  Jesus Christ.  I almost just passed out, dude.  It's so goddamn funny.  Him saying,  see why I'm embarrassed 
[00:54:30]  as he's...  Wow.  That was great.  I can't even do that justice.  How fucking funny that was.  Joe, you saw his package.  Now, you know,  you gotta give him advice  because he's got this big thing  hopefully with Christina  this weekend.  You know, Bobo,  I gotta be honest, man.  You got...  There's a lot of hair,  but it's an evenly spread bush.  I didn't think it looked that bad.  You have the same hair  in your pubic area  as you do on your balls.  Yeah.  Like, the whole area  is just covered in hair. 
[00:55:00]  It's like an overgrown fucking yard.  So it kind of didn't bother me  for that matter.  If it was a little...  If it was thin in one area...  If it was patchy or something...  Then I would have said  you gotta trim it up,  but I kinda...  It's fucking even, dude.  It's even.  It looked like when  William Hurt comes out  of the tank  in Altered States.  Does Christina like Harry Cox?  Yeah.  That's what I wanna know.  Who knows?  Of course that's what  you wanna know. 
[00:55:30]  Bobo?  Bobo?  Yeah?  Yeah.  This could be trouble.  She goes,  no hair down there.  She doesn't like it.  But,  is he growing a mustache?  She goes,  preferably handlebar.  There you go.  I'm not kidding.  Look.  It's right here.  Well,  is the handlebar  a little bit longer?  A little longer.  Yeah,  the ends gotta grow  and then you gotta twirl them.  We're gonna make you  into a stud.  Give us a couple more weeks.  You gotta work on the handlebar  She's not gonna be able  to resist you,  but the problem now is  she says no hair down there. 
[00:56:00]  She doesn't like hair down there,  so now what?  Now what?  If I could figure out  how to shave it  without cutting myself.  Well,  you don't use a ray...  Maybe you could use like a...  Tweezer.  Like an electric ray.  Grow the whole thing in  and then maybe we could  shape it for you next Friday.  What?  Shave what?  You know what I'm getting at.  Yes,  of course I do.  Well,  well,  if you could,  uh...  Tell them the looks  coming back.  I would prefer  a chick shave  the cock.  The cock? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah,  other than myself,  I would prefer  a chick.  I would prefer...  What would you like her  to shave it with?  Well,  whatever she prefers using.  Electric razor,  manual razor,  Mach 3,  turbo.  How about if she uses  tweezers?  Yeah,  or waxing  really gets rid of it.  No,  no,  that'd be so painful.  On your balls?  Yeah,  it would be painful.  Did you ever see  Mary Carey's movie,  Wax My Balls? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah,  Mary Carey's latest said,  I have a shaved pussy.  It's a...  Brilliant title.  It's a franchise,  as we said earlier.  But,  you know something?  She said she doesn't like hair.  Yeah,  well...  So now you're instantly  gonna be...  Yeah,  but I'm not comfortable  shaving...  But what if...  Look,  I don't care about  what you're comfortable with.  What if it comes to the point  where you're with her,  you're alone,  it's go time,  and you pull the pants down  and she goes,  oh...  Well,  if that's the case, 
[00:57:30]  I'll shave it there.  Well,  on the spot,  during the fucking  magic moment?  You can't shave  as you're ready  to have sex.  Well,  I'll shave it right before  and the magic moment happens.  And then what?  Right before  the magic moment happens.  The magic moment happens.  But you can't  because the magic moment...  That's a long process.  That's why they call it  a magic moment.  Right.  You don't know  when it's happening,  what the hell it is.  If the date goes well,  it's this,  it's that.  I guess I could always  try shaving it myself,  but I don't... 
[00:58:00]  I'm not sure  what's the best one to use  because I just got  an electric razor.  an M80.  I got an electric razor,  but it's for good...  I don't want to get  a cock smell  on an electric razor.  Well,  perhaps you could  wash first.  You could shower.  Wash it really well.  I don't want to get  cock smell  on my razor.  I don't think  it's good  for shaving long hair.  He's got enough  pubes down there  that we could  shave his pubes 
[00:58:30]  and then we could  design his mustache.  Maybe then we could...  What if we take  your pubes  and then do  like a transplant?  We can then...  No, no, no, no.  I don't think  I want pubes  on my face.  We'll glue them  into a little  Fu Manchu.  No, no, no.  I don't want that.  I threw up  when I saw  Jackass number two.  Which is...  They did that  at Jackass number two.  All right, listen.  He is the greatest.  This is a very good idea.  Eric should do it.  No, she...  Is he rocking the area? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, no.  This is a very good idea.  No, no, no.  Don't worry.  Don't worry, Bobo.  We love you.  I would use  some of your hair plugs.  I don't have hair plugs.  Oh, see.  I don't have hair plugs.  But my sister says  your hair plugs  are very sexy.  I don't have hair plugs.  Please go out  with Bobo's sister.  Please.  How is your sister?  Is she hot?  Let me see a picture of her.  Oh, wait.  She's young.  I don't have a picture  of her on my phone.  She's too young,  even for Anthony.  Why?  How old is she?  She's turning 14 
[00:59:30]  in September.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  So I got to wait  until September?  No, no, no.  Try waiting  until she turns 18.  18.  Bobo, what does  your cock smell like?  All right.  E-Rog.  E-Rog.  We'll sit there.  E-Rog.  E-Rog goes in  and just goes,  oh, no.  E-Rog.  I don't know.  We're just thinking  that we want to know  what Bobo's pubis area  smells like.  Have you been listening?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[01:00:00]  I just heard  what this was now.  Now, what happened  is Bobo has to shave  because Christine  doesn't like hair.  I just got a text  saying, no,  no hair down there.  He's very hairy.  Okay.  And we're telling him  to shave  and he has an electric razor  but he doesn't want  to use it  because, as he said,  does not want to get  his cock smell  on his razor.  So, now we're thinking,  how bad of a cock smell  do you have to have  that it gets on your razor?  Well, I shower every day  but, unfortunately, 
[01:00:30]  it gets sweaty  over the course of a day.  Well, you know.  So, you have, like,  sweaty ball sack and...  Yeah, it gets sweaty  when you wear  tighty-whities.  And what happens?  Like...  You showered this morning?  Yeah, did you shower?  Yes, I did.  Holy shit.  Okay.  Jesus.  All right.  It's probably going to smell  fresh and clean.  All right, Iraq,  assume the position.  It's very difficult  to get it to smell replete.  Oh, please.  Oh, my God.  Just say,  no homo.  No homo.  All right.  No homo. 
[01:01:00]  Let it be known  that Bobo is now  getting ready  to pull his pants down.  Iraq, you want  to assume the position?  Yeah, Iraq,  give a little smell.  All right, no film.  That's fine.  Give a little smell.  Fair enough.  Just a little smell.  The camera will pick it up anyway.  All right.  His penis sticks...  Oh, my God.  There's string hanging off of it.  He's got some pre coming out.  Are you leaking, Bobo?  Bobo, have you had a hard on? 
[01:01:30]  Did you have a boner?  No, I've been close to it,  but it goes down right before  it even gets to full.  Wait, Bobo.  That sweat.  Oh, my God.  You can smell it.  You can smell it.  Email that to Howard.  All right, Bobo.  Bobo.  Did you just jizz in your pants?  No.  I know you sing a song called  I Jizzed In My Pants.  You had a little slippery stuff,  though, coming out.  A little bit.  No, that's sweat. 
[01:02:00]  No.  Sweat doesn't drip out of the tip of your dick  like fucking crazy glue.  Well, yeah, I had an erection.  Just hearing those voicemails of me.  Hearing my own voicemails.  Oh, fuck.  Wait, hearing your own voice gives you an erection?  No, hearing those voicemails,  thinking about what might happen  as a result of them.  Oh, so you hear her voice.  No.  No. 
[01:02:30]  No.  Hearing those voicemails,  thinking about what might happen.  We played the voicemails.  You've had a hard-on for an hour?  No, because I know  I'm eventually going to get laid by her.  It's got to freaking happen.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I can't take it.  He's fucking freaking out of his fucking...  Out of his ewes.  Were you coming?  No.  No.  He was dripping clear stuff.  All right.  Pull the pants down.  Iraq's got it.  Mars already said that there's something  going to happen at least 10 feet away. 
[01:03:00]  I was...  What happened?  What happened?  Travis just sent him to my ear.  I hope he comes in his face.  All right, Bobo, you know.  You know what to do.  You say no homo, and it's all good.  Iraq, assume the position.  Iraq is now assuming the position.  All right.  You're right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  All right.  All right, now.  Oh, no. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, please.  Please, just don't take it too long.  What?  What does he say?  Please don't what?  Don't take so long.  Just not once, and that's it.  You're worried about him taking too long.  Yeah.  You think he's going to be fucking swooning down there?  No, no, no.  He's almost got a handlebar mustache going on down there.  Iraq doesn't know how to approach this.  Wait, hold on, guys.  I'm jizzing in my pants a little bit right now.  Hold on.  Iraq's got some.  There's bumps. 
[01:04:00]  Like where the fold is, there's these red bumps.  Yeah, well, that's all the other.  That's for being operated on so many times.  Well, smell the bumps.  They probably smell the worst.  Yeah, go check out Frankencock.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  Give a big inhale.  Wait, he's not even close.  Iraq, you're not close enough.  No, no, no.  Iraq, no.  Hey, wait a minute.  Wait.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bobo, this is a good test because you don't want Christina to smell this. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, toughed up your hair a little bit.  Like, move it around so that some air can circulate around there.  No, no, I mean, like, tussle it.  Tussle your hair.  Give me rubber gloves before I do this.  You don't want to touch your own fucking...  How do you expect Christina to touch you down there if you want rubber gloves to touch yourself?  We've got to teach you some shit, man.  Yeah.  What is he doing? 
[01:05:00]  All right.  There you go.  Very good.  Now, Iraq.  All right, Iraq.  Give a good sniff.  Get a good sniff.  We want you really close.  He's not going to push your face in.  You've got to get on your knees.  Point it at me.  Don't point it at me.  Your eyes going on the side.  Give a good sniff.  Stay there.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Oh, God damn it.  Get close.  Real close.  And you've got to get right by the hair.  Get in there.  Right by the hair.  Get in there.  And give his eyes. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, can I pull it up now?  Iraq's starting to puke.  Could I pull my pants off, please?  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And after a successful ONA show appearance, show star Bobo was talking to his girlfriend  Christina in the serious offices.  While talking to her, Bobo quickly and obviously became fully erect. 
[01:06:00]  We went to Bobo for comment.  Bobo, um, what's going on?  Well, I'm talking to her about, I'm trying to figure out like...  Christina, you mean.  Yeah, like how long would it take before she's, uh, before I banged her.  Right.  And, uh, all this talk, does it have you feeling a bit excited?  Uh, yeah.  But I know, I don't know how long it'll take, but I'm sure the payoff will be big.  Now, will the payoff be as big as the erection you obviously have right now? 
[01:06:30]  Uh, yeah.  And maybe she'll get a big payoff also, if you know what, wink, wink.  By that, you mean the erection that you obviously have right now?  Yeah, but she's going to get a big payoff, all right?  No, I can see it right there.  Are you bashful at all about the fact that you're walking around a place of business and  you obviously, uh, are fully erect?  Well, unfortunately, when you're, you kind of have to expect this crazy stuff when you're  in the same building as the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, to have half retards walking around with boners?  Uh, I don't even, I think I'm less than half retards. 
[01:07:00]  A quarter.  Me, me, yeah, a quarter is probably the, the right description.  Do we have any, uh, possibility of a bit of leakage or something happening today?  I'll, I'll find out when I get home.  Any, anything about that, you'll know after.  Sure, but you are fully erect.  Yeah.  Bobo proudly displayed his erection for Christina, who didn't look terribly impressed.  We reached out to her for the exclusive.  So, Christina, what's going on with you and Bobo today? 
[01:07:30]  Well, uh, right currently, right now, I'm actually staring at his boner.  Yeah, is this something that, uh, he looks to be very pleased.  He's been, he's been erect for a good ten minutes.  Yeah.  Which is impressive.  It, it, it goes on and off sometimes.  Now, he looks to be very prideful about the fact that, uh, you're staring at his erection.  Is that something that he should be proud of?  Yes, uh, he did mention before that I should buy an array of different size condoms, Magnum especially.  So, I mean, I can't help but check out the goods. 
[01:08:00]  Based on what you see in front of you, would you think that Magnum would be an appropriate size?  I would have to say, oh, he's shaking it out now.  It, it just grew even more.  I would have to say after him shaking his leg, yes, absolutely.  And by yes, you mean...  No, not at all.  We thought the story would end there, but just as the backstage crew was packing up their equipment,  ONA producer Danny approached Bobo with a ruler to get an exact measurement of the bow boner.  Okay, let's measure, Sam.  Maybe in Canada it's bigger.  Could someone tell me what, what size it'd be in millimeters? 
[01:08:30]  Oh yeah, you are rocking.  Danny has a ruler by Bobo's crotch right now.  Uh, Danny...  Bobo's three.  If you could give us the official measurement of Bobo's erection...  It's, we're about two and three quarters, so he's doing pretty, he's doing pretty well.  Could someone show me in millimeters what it'd be in Canada?  Alright, so you're a full three inches, is that, is that something you're proud of?  Three inches I feel fine, but I, if it can get to eight inches, that'd be better.  Will Bobo get to eight inches one day?  Certainly not. 
[01:09:00]  But that won't stop him from doing his best to sexually assault any woman he meets regardless.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Hey, this is Club Soda Kenny from the Opie and Anthony Show, welcoming all the new subscribers  to Sirius XM after turning on their new radios.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[01:09:30]  Is that what you wanted?  That's fine.  If you want to give a description of the show, you can, if you don't want to.  Describe, what do you mean the description of the show?  Describe the show a bit.  Oh, describe the show a bit.  Oh, now I'm put on the spot.  I don't have anything to think about.  You can just go from here to here.  No, but you're asking me to do something, so I don't want to let you down.  You know, that's what this show is all about. 
[01:10:00]  Is that good?  That's fine.  That's working.  All right, you're satisfied with that description.  It's the worst of the year 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, this was an amazing year for celebrity blowouts. 
[01:10:30]  This one happened to have happened on a movie set and was recorded for all our enjoyment.  Of course, some radio shows, it took them months to pick up on this, but we were from day one on the bandwagon for the Christian Bale meltdown.  Now, he was on the set of Terminator Salvation.  Correct.  And he got upset, I guess, at the lighting guy or a prop guy?  Yeah, I think he was doing a scene.  And by the way, if you saw Terminator Salvation, there really wasn't that much deep acting involved. 
[01:11:00]  But he was doing a scene, and I guess some kind of lighting guy or prop guy wandered onto the set.  And what resulted was a tirade that left us with audio clips for months.  And I think after this bit, we'll put in a remix or two.  Yeah.  That we were rather fond of.  Christian Bale remixes all came from this one bit, so enjoy, and maybe you're getting inspired.  It's number 17 on the worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the worst of 2009.  Christian Bale, this audio's making the rounds. 
[01:11:30]  We got a crystal clear copy of this.  He's on the set of what?  Terminator, right?  Yeah.  Is it a TV show or a movie?  Movie.  A movie.  They're redoing Terminator.  Yeah.  Well, not really.  I know.  They're doing a prequel.  It's pretty much a prequel.  It's the future.  No, it's the war with the machines.  It's the war.  Okay.  It's after the machines have become aware.  What about the governator? 
[01:12:00]  It sounds like a pretty good premise, but I'm sure he'll talk like this.  Oh, he does.  I don't know when he started to suck, but boy, when he jumped in and sucked him with both feet.  Hey.  Is he playing John Connor in that?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Kent, the movie guy.  He's been waiting for this moment, so he knows why Christian Bale freaked out, so we'll  let Kent, the movie guy, set this up.  Go ahead, Kent.  Hey, so they were filming the most emotional scene, probably the only one in the entire 
[01:12:30]  film.  Yeah.  And their director of photography is this guy named Shane Hurlbutt.  He's pretty inexperienced.  He hasn't shot very many action films and basically wasn't in the scene or in the shot, but was  just in Christian Bale's point of view.  Oh, boy.  And yeah, like behind, he was filming a scene with Bryce Dallas Howard, and he was right 
[01:13:00]  behind her staring at lights and messing with lights, and that's basically what set Bale  off.  He hasn't been able to do like a dramatic role for a long time, so now that he gets to do  something where he emotes a little bit, this guy comes in and just starts trompling around  with the lights and everything, and that's basically what set Bale off.  He was distracted.  You know, and I could relate.  Back at AAF, I remember when we were trying to create, as we all know by now, if you linger 
[01:13:30]  longer, we are artists creating on a daily basis.  And we had some creation we were in the middle of up there, and then we had the fat guy,  the engineer, I forgot his name, Eric.  I liked Eric.  Eric, yeah.  With the drill.  He was drilling and hammering.  As we're trying to do our radio show.  Yeah.  He's drilling and hammering.  It's like there's construction going on as we're trying to do a show.  But, you know, we're professional.  We're raw as above.  Yeah.  All right, so let's get to the Christian Bale audio. 
[01:14:00]  Here's him just losing his mind.  I want you off the f***ing set, you prick.  I'm sorry.  No, don't just be sorry.  Think for one f***ing second.  What the f*** are you doing?  Are you professional or not?  Yes, I am.  Do I f***ing walk around and rip that?  No, shut the f*** up, Bruce.  Do I what?  No.  No.  Don't shut me up.  Am I going to walk around and rip your f***ing lights down in the middle of a scene?  Then why the f*** are you walking right through? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, da-da-da-da, like this in the background.  What the f*** is it with you?  He's fantastic.  I love him.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Like, I hate to say I'm kind of side with Christian Bale.  When you're doing something like that in some dumbbell, not that I know what it's like to act like that.  I never did anything more than, shut up, Lou.  But I can imagine you get yourself in this headspace to do something.  You know, people wonder, how do they do so well on film?  How do they make you believe it? 
[01:15:00]  It's like when you finally get into that place to do it and some ass just yutches through.  I don't care if he's right or wrong.  Yeah.  I just love anyone that can get this angry and curse like this.  This is me.  I love listening to this.  You know, I don't do it in the workplace.  That's open.  No.  That's true.  You do it when certain people move into the neighborhood.  Right.  Property values.  What the f**k are you doing selling to a f**k? 
[01:15:30]  That's the house next door to me, you f**k lover.  That's what all the Jews said to whoever sold you the house.  Andrew.  You really think you bring up the property value, mafia boy?  Right.  Very good, Jimmy.  The only non-Jew in the neighborhood.  Oh, boy, you're a disgrace.  They're sitting right there in front of me.  I just had my Christmas lights taken down last week.  Boy, were they angry. 
[01:16:00]  How belligerent are you?  Santa Claus in July?  That constant reminder of their crime against him.  You know, you kid, but if I could have a couple of minutes here.  Chris and Jimmy?  Yes, of course.  Or Jimmy Jeans.  You know, it is that Christ came to them.  Praise his name.  Let's get back to the Christian Bale audio.  Two Jews walk into a bar, and that bar was called Damnation.  Praise his name. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  No, I don't want to do this, Christian Jews.  Of course.  We got to get the Bale audio on.  Yes.  It continued.  Oh, there's more.  There's more.  Oh, my God.  Don't worry.  That's just the beginning.  You got any f***ing idea about, hey, it's f***ing distracting having somebody walking  up behind Bryce in the middle of the f***ing scene?  Give me a f***ing answer.  What don't you get about it?  I was looking at the light.  Oh, good for you. 
[01:17:00]  And how was it?  I hope it was f***ing good because it's useless now, isn't it?  F***ing shake, man, you're amateur.  Wow.  Oh, he's hot under the collar.  When are you going to play the Christian Bale audio?  Hey, I'm a...  I thought that was you to Travis the other day.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, everybody. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Relax.  Oh.  Present your heart to this guy.  What?  Oh.  Did it...  No, wait.  What kind of...  I wonder...  Now, here's what I wonder.  Like, was he really this angry?  Does he need this to kind of stay in character?  Like, uh...  Like...  Either way, you're a psychopath.  Yeah.  Either way, you're a psychopath.  Listen to this guy.  In the middle of the scene, he does walk up while they're shooting.  He walks in his side...  Lights in him.  Yeah, in his line of sight.  It's hard enough...  Like, when I would have to emote.  Oh, yes, Jimmy.  Like, I would have to be angry or creepy. 
[01:18:00]  It's so hard because you have lights around you and a camera anyway.  It's completely un...  He stinks and I don't like him.  Do you know that was a 75-take thing?  The first time I did it on Spider-Man, they're like...  Actually, I was like, he stinks and I don't like him.  Like, no, it's not a musical.  That'll work.  He stinks and I don't like...  They're like, enough with the Ethel Merman.  I'm like, I have to tribute her.  More Christian Bale on set. 
[01:18:30]  Losing his mind.  McG, you got something to say to this prick?  I didn't see it happen.  Well, somebody should be watching and keeping an eye on him.  Fair enough.  It's the second time that he doesn't give a...  About what is going on in front of the camera.  Oh.  All right?  I'm trying to do a scene here and I'm going...  Why the...  Is Shane walking in there?  What is he doing there?  Do you understand my mind is not in the scene if you're doing that?  Stay off the f***ing set, man.  For f***ing sake. 
[01:19:00]  Wow.  That was the second time you've done that.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You just said it.  Yeah, this is the second time.  Two times.  That's what you got.  You son of a b***h.  Get off.  I'm going to f***ing kick your f***ing ass.  You know, shut up for a second, all right?  I'm going to go...  Do you want me to go f***ing trash your lights?  Do you want me to f***ing trash them?  Then why are you trashing my scene?  I'm not trying to be trashed.  You are trashing my scene.  You do it one more f***ing time.  I ain't walking on this set if you're still hired. 
[01:19:30]  I'm f***ing serious.  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  But I don't f***ing cut it when you f***ing the f***ing around like this on set.  Let's get Tom and put this back on.  Let's go again.  Seriously, man.  You and me, we're f***ing done professionally.  F***ing ass.  Wow.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?  That's a good one, huh?  This is Phil Collins.  You're doing to this scene what I did to the Batman character. 
[01:20:00]  You're ruining it.  Tony in Jersey.  Tony!  Tony, let's go!  Yo!  We're having a good one today, Tony.  He's on the air.  He's probably hoping that I'll yell, but I'm not.  That's right.  Yeah, well, take a phone call, and you don't even answer the bloody thing.  What the f***'s wrong with you?  You're ruining the show. 
[01:20:30]  We've got a call lined up, and you can't even f***ing take the call.  Your name is up there.  I said your f***ing name, and you don't.  What's the matter with you?  I'm not going to do a f***ing show with these phones.  Steve, get in here.  How many times have I told you I need this audio?  No, you've never told me that, but you knew I was thinking it!  All right.  You're f***ing f***ing it!  All right, I get it.  They're not psychic.  Pendulum was crap!  Ann taught me that lesson a few months ago. 
[01:21:00]  I've changed.  And it's like, you know, I've got to tell you, these guys aren't psychic.  I know.  I remember that conversation.  I'm like, oh, oops.  Uh, Jason, Virginia.  Travis, you hand out one f***ing piece of paper when I'm trying to do a f***ing live read!  I disgust that!  You're f***ing distracting me!  Oh, wait, he's relaxing.  I disgust it.  I didn't yell at that one. 
[01:21:30]  And here's at Opie's house.  Stop picking your f***ing nose!  How does Lindsay sound like that?  She doesn't.  That was him in the mirror.  Oh, jeez!  She just sat in the living room covering her ears like Matthew Modine in Full Metal Jacket going,  I've married a psychopath.  Help me.  Let's go to Jason in Virginia Beach.  Barrel time.  What's up, boy?  Yeah, what's up, Jason?  Hey, you're all calling him a psychopath, but Ant's walking around in fatigues, 
[01:22:00]  and you're smashing CD players every other day,  so go figure.  Crazy.  I did kick a CD player the other day.  It's my urban warfare attire.  Oh, my gosh!  That a boy!  Now, Mike might have a little more info on this clip.  Mike in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mikey.  Is there any doubt that this guy did not beat the crap out of his mother and sister  when he was in London a few months ago?  Yeah, but who knows?  She might have talked at the wrong time.  I like this Christian Bale guy.  You're right, Ant. 
[01:22:30]  I turned the corner on him.  Come on, Mom!  But is this an old...  You're bloody c***!  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Way to beep the wrong word.  Wow, wow.  It was also a perfect adjective for...  You know, it's one of those...  Yes, of course it was.  Maybe it was just...  You know, maybe she was cranky.  Now, was this done before he had a problem with his mom and sister?  Is this an old clip?  Nah, this has to be relatively new.  Maybe it just is finally getting out there. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Ah! Da-da-da-da-da-l! Dut-da-da-da-da-da-l!  Ma-da-da-da-da-da-l!  What the fuck are you doing?!  No! It's fucking distracting!  Fuck! I want you off the fucking set, you prick!  What don't you fucking understand? Let's go again! 
[01:23:30]  Oh, good for you.  You're listening to the Worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the Worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show  with Sam and E-Rock. 
[01:24:00]  Sam, this segment was sometime in mid-April.  I'm not exactly sure.  Maybe it was the 10th.  It was around then.  Around there.  This was our first live show from the new Sirius facility.  Yeah.  Or Sirius XM, as they call it.  When they pretty much kicked us out of our old place  and abducted us and they keep us hostage here.  Well, we wanted to make the most of our new digs, our new studio.  We looked around, though, and saw a bunch of strangers.  So what Opie and Anthony did, 
[01:24:30]  since we no longer had access to wireless mics,  is we sent Mars into the engineering booth  and got him to find all the mic extension cables  that they basically had in the entire building.  And we extended a mic and a pair of headphones  all the way throughout the entire floor  so they can send me out to meet all of our fellow disc jockeys.  Well, also point out that it was not just  there was all these strangers we wanted to talk to.  We got word that everybody was really upset that we were coming here 
[01:25:00]  and a lot of people hated us.  Yeah, that's right.  And they wanted to find out why.  And so, of course, I was the messenger used.  This actually allowed me...  I became notorious at Sirius XM  for just being a little asshole within my first day here.  Let me recall what you were actually saying that day.  Um, you were searching for anybody around.  You were hiding outside the bathrooms.  Yeah, I...  Yeah.  And you were flaunting our vast wealth.  Yes, I was mentioning dark televisions. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we had a lot of them.  Well, I'm not going to give you the number,  but you'll find out right now.  Here it is, our first day at the Sirius XM Studios.  It's number 16 on the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  First day from the brand new studio here at Sirius XM.  Indeed.  Soon to be Sirius.  Really?  What are you hearing?  I mean, come on.  The XM's a little small in the logo. 
[01:26:00]  And it's in parentheses.  Parentheses.  If you know the logo, that's a pretty good joke.  All right.  Ah, a lot of parentheses around the XM.  I mean, it's an afterthought.  So, yeah, you've got to sprint to the bathroom.  I just learned that.  Yeah, the bathroom's kind of far away.  It's not like the shitter of old.  And it really is a shit factory.  I've never seen more stalls in one bathroom in my life.  I think we have more stalls than Citi Field. 
[01:26:30]  What, does everybody come here straight from the fucking planes  that land from Mexico?  It's annoying.  And you have to...  I went down the line.  He just looks like, eh, maybe that didn't go over as well.  I could have done more with that.  Did you go to the bathroom yet?  What's that?  Did you go in the bathroom?  You have to kick in the stalls to find a clean one.  The fourth one was the clean one for me.  Who are the animals that have to pee all over the fucking seat?  Ah, that's me.  Are you one of those guys?  No, my aim is very good. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, but I think people purposely do that.  They have to, like, mark their...  They don't give a shit.  You know what?  Lift the fucking seat up, too.  Use your foot.  It doesn't matter.  You don't have to touch it.  Give it a little more room.  Use your foot.  That way you're not splashing all over the fucking seat.  People got to sit on that.  Maybe someone's taking the boner leak.  Maybe they still have a more...  Sitting down or...  Oh, the boner...  Might be our neighbors.  Yeah, if you're taking a boner leak over there, there's a problem.  Let me move forward for Kenny.  This freaking animal. 
[01:27:30]  During the commercial break, one of the guys just slammed right into the back of my chair.  I was like, oh, man.  I literally have, like, no room back here.  All right, now I'm freezing again.  Can we turn up the heat?  Is it cold again?  I haven't been...  Slightly.  Like, you tap it.  It's very small increments until we get it dialed in.  All you do is tap it once, and it'll go up 15 degrees.  I don't understand how I have 3G on the iPhone, and it won't give me internet. 
[01:28:00]  What the fuck is the use of 3G?  That really sucks, Jimmy.  I don't know what's going on with that.  It sounds nuts.  What Mike?  What Mike?  Daniel.  They were named yesterday.  Young Daniel.  I will try this.  Go.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice.  I was having that same problem.  Try rebooting the phone.  Seriously.  Wait.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Sam's first.  Did you turn it off?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sam's first.  Sam's first.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  Here he is.  Shh.  Oh, my God.  He's a creep.  Here it is.  What?  Here in 10 minutes.  He's got to be on the air in 10 minutes.  Okay. 
[01:28:30]  10 minutes.  We need him for four.  He left already.  Your mic crapped.  I figured out which mic yours was at the last second.  So what happened there, Sam?  I said, excuse me, sir.  And he looked up and he shook his head and said, I got to be on the air in 10 minutes and  walked away.  Did he have like news copy?  He had papers.  He had papers?  Yeah.  And he had a collar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a businessman type thing.  Excuse me, sir.  Yes.  What's your name?  My name is Ryan Sampson.  I host the morning mashup on Sirius. 
[01:29:00]  How are you?  Oh, the morning mashup.  Oh, cool, Ryan Sampson.  What's the haps?  The haps is water over this way.  Would you guys like some water?  We can get you some.  No, thanks.  That's cool.  You got the nice radio voice.  Thank you.  What's the morning mashup?  We're on Sirius Hits 1.  It's the Top 40 station.  We're right next door.  You guys are like our new neighbors.  Wait, are you the gay guys?  Yes.  No.  No.  Wait, we heard hip hop, gay.  Top 40.  Martha Stewart.  Where's the Top 40?  No, we're two studios down.  Sirius Hits 1.  It's like two studios down. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  There's free soda.  He's right after the There Goes the Neighborhood studio.  What song is playing so you can get water?  What song is playing so you can get water?  Kelly Clarkson.  Kelly Clarkson.  Ah.  On Hits 1 right now.  Can I say one thing?  The fucking break room's a hit.  Really?  I couldn't get out of there.  It's fucking tiny.  Yeah.  It's like a port-a-john, and there's free coffee, which is shitty, but there's also a vending  machine, and there's free sodas.  I took some pretzels. 
[01:30:00]  You see how much milk they bring in every morning?  That's probably for the week.  Very wholesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Good job on What's the Haps there.  Thank you very much.  Why didn't you do the black guy?  You were scared he was going to punch you?  We were talking to Ryan Sampson.  The black guy walked by and just tapped Sam on the shoulder and looked at him like, hey,  little man.  Good job, cracker.  Yeah.  Sam.  Hello, sir.  What's your name?  My name is Stanley T.  What's up?  Where are you going, Stanley?  To do the morning mashup show in Sirius Hits 1.  Wait.  XM 20 on 20. 
[01:30:30]  But Ryan Sampson does the morning mashup.  It's four of us.  This is the opening in Anthony's show.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Brian.  Welcome to Sirius.  What's going on?  Thank you, sir.  All right.  What do you do for the show, though?  Because I've never heard the show.  What do you do for the show?  I'm a host.  It's four of us.  Cool.  What are you guys talking about today?  We were just talking about children suing their parents over punishment.  Oh.  A six-year-old kid sued his dad.  They're doing that?  Over punishment that was too harsh.  Wow.  You've got a producer.  With four hosts.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  With four hosts, are you worried that one or two of you might get canned?  Worried?  No.  We don't worry here.  Why not?  Wow.  We don't worry at Sirius.  No.  We just do great radio.  All the legends of radio in this building.  Well.  Y'all know that.  What y'all doing here?  Legends.  Being legends.  There you go.  That's what I'm saying.  I like this guy.  So check out the morning mashup when you guys can.  I've heard of y'all.  Welcome to Sirius.  We're right next door, by the way.  All right.  We're going to come in and do your show now.  See you guys later.  Thank you.  There it is.  The morning mashup is a couple of studios down. 
[01:31:30]  It is odd to just have so many different studios in this place.  It's a real beehive of activity here.  It certainly is.  Because here we go.  Oh, this guy's shaking his head.  What?  Excuse me, sirs.  What's your name?  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Where do those guys have to go besides not to do sit-ups?  Those are the gentlemen from the Al Q morning show.  Oh.  They don't want anything to do with us?  They don't want to talk to us.  They're on the air.  They don't have time.  They were not happy.  They don't have time.  They didn't look happy, though.  Steve, what was that about?  They were very upset. 
[01:32:00]  Why?  Why are they upset?  We're trying to get to know people around here.  As they were walking away, I heard one guy say, oh, they came for us.  They didn't come for you.  Exactly.  We would if you wanted us to.  Yeah.  Whatever you need.  Oh, that's.  Wow.  We just want to.  I'm sure we'll get to know them later.  Sam is such an asshole.  Exactly.  I love it.  How they didn't stop for a twinkish little Sam.  It's amazing.  They were two big bears. 
[01:32:30]  Two big bears.  Speaking of polar bears.  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  Now people are avoiding Sam and going to the air.  I know.  I noticed that.  And you know what it is?  See, here's the reputation you get.  It's not even that we're being idiots.  We're just coming by.  They tell us where they work, what they do.  We have a little quick discussion, and then they're on their way.  It worked great with the Top 40 stage in the morning mashup guys.  Our new friend Ryan.  Our new friend Ryan from the morning mashup. 
[01:33:00]  Who's the other dude?  I forgot his name.  So did I.  Oh, boy.  The other guy from the morning mashup.  The other guy.  The Top.  And then we get dissed like that.  Remember that, Sam.  That goes in the remember that file.  This is my friend from the IT department who was fixing my computer this morning.  Good morning.  What's your name?  My name is Suresh.  How are you?  Good, Suresh.  What's the haps?  Not much.  Shift is ending. 
[01:33:30]  Getting ready to go home.  Feeling good.  Oh, overnight.  Sam, ask if his life has changed since Slumdog Millionaire.  Looks like the host.  See, perhaps that's why.  Millonair.  Perhaps that's why people aren't stopping.  He looks like it with the beard.  Suresh, has your life as a game show host changed since Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  Sam, get this.  Excuse me, sir.  It's Slumdog Millionaire.  Do you have a second?  Oh, what did I say?  It's a mile a minute here.  What's your name?  Larry Kerwin.  Larry Kerwin, what do you do here? 
[01:34:00]  I do the Celtic Crush, the Celtic show.  Oh, nice.  I've heard a lot of good things.  What's the haps?  What's the what?  Haps.  What do you mean?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  That's what I said.  Oh.  What do you mean?  It's like, what's the haps, you know?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  It's called Fortin.  New lingo.  I just wanted to do the show.  Cool.  What time does it start?  It starts 10 minutes ago.  Oh, you're late.  Wait, what is it?  Was he Ron Bennington? 
[01:34:30]  Perpetually late.  Yeah, we need to know what the show's about.  The Celtic Crush, is it all music or is it talk to?  What's the Celtic Crush all about?  What's the deal with that?  Well, it's a mixture of all types of music that come from the Celtic nations, rock music  and traditional music mixed in with a bit of talk about it, you know, how it came about.  Is it shock jock stuff?  No, it's not shock jock.  No.  Very, very discreet.  Wait.  I tell no stories about the various musicians I know, being one myself, so. 
[01:35:00]  Wait, Sam, I didn't really understand the description of the show.  Oh, could you further?  I was reading some instant feedback.  Our hosts were reading the feedback.  They don't always pay attention.  Could you further describe the show?  So it's music mainly?  It's mostly music.  Music from all the different Celtic nations.  And then I'm a musician myself.  I'm with the band Black 47.  So it's stories about the music and about the musicians who make it.  Right.  Cool.  This is going great. 
[01:35:30]  Well, it's been.  Is it Hapsenough?  It is Hapsenough.  It's been a pleasure.  I don't care.  I don't care.  It's been a pleasure talking to you, and we're going to break a leg today.  I'll try it.  Take care, man.  Thank you.  Making friends here at Sirius XM.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  As soon as I saw him.  Da-da-da-da-da.  As soon as I said, Sam, and then I asked him again, and I see the thing going down over  the fucking template going on the sound machine.  So I can pick some good ones. 
[01:36:00]  These are not going to be cheers.  These are not going to be cheers.  Oof.  So far, though, Sam, everyone being, just about everyone being very nice to us.  Except for those out-cue guys.  Yeah, they ran away.  Maybe they've heard our show.  Well, that could be, okay.  Maybe you got a point.  Right.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I'm going to ask you.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth. 
[01:36:30]  Do you want to kiss me?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  The boy fights for the pink team.  All right.  We're going there.  Well, where's my...  Oh, those guys are facts!  I should have played that role.  I was just saying, keep that one handy.  Holy shit.  Is there an over-under as far as when we're going to be kicked back to 57th Street? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  And this is us being nice and polite, by the way.  Yes, it is.  The restraint that we have today is astounding.  Mm-hmm.  Because there are things I just want to say and do that I'm sure, well, maybe in a week.  A week by tomorrow.  Two days?  Yeah.  Sam, Kenny, and Mars do a little gossiping outside the studio. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, are they already gossiping about things?  What were they gossiping about, Sam?  They're bothering me.  Mars keeps telling me to get a longer cord so I can go down further, but I am informing  him that then I won't be able to see you.  Yeah.  Because that would be down too far.  That's true.  And then Kenny said that a certain type of people, to identify themselves, wear cock rings  on their belt loops.  Jesus.  Which is information I didn't ask for, but received.  Is that true? 
[01:38:00]  Cock rings.  Allegedly.  Oh, allegedly.  Okay.  I thought maybe I had some confirmation.  Oh, my God.  What are we doing to ourselves again?  What happened to the hallway?  It was very busy, 20 minutes ago.  Yeah.  Well, I think the word got out.  I've been watching.  Avoid the assholes.  People are coming halfway down the hall and taking the long way by turning and going down  the other hallway.  Well, you've got to hide a little bit, Sam.  Okay.  It looked very obvious.  Exactly. 
[01:38:30]  Well, you want to...  Okay.  Oh.  You'll be able to figure it out.  I'll just get low.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hello, miss.  What's your name?  I'm late.  That's a strange name.  Oh.  What'd she say?  That could mean something.  I'm late.  Uh-oh.  Better tell the boyfriend.  Exactly.  See a big shoe print in the front of her shirt?  You know this is too much fun.  You know this is going to be shut down by tomorrow, right?  Oh, they're going to...  Look.  We've had some...  Blah, blah, blah.  We've had some complaints about harassing people in the hallways here. 
[01:39:00]  We really can't do that.  I understand what you were going for, but...  App!  You shouldn't be late to broadcast, though.  Exactly.  And it's a weird...  Everyone's late, by the way.  Did you notice this?  The industry is not in the best shape.  Broadcasting on the whole, let's say.  Right.  Would you come in late?  No!  Or be late to things? 
[01:39:30]  Just don't call me late for supper.  For supper.  Supper.  This one's pretty good.  God, the hallways are...  It's like a ghost town.  Yeah, I just saw somebody start to come up this hallway and then take the long way because  I just saw him come over that way.  Oh, there's a detour.  He's definitely...  They have signs set up.  If we had Agent Orange in front of the studio, it couldn't divert people as much as that little  creep with his mic.  Can we get E-Rock on the other way?  Yes.  Let's get E-Rock with a mic all the way down the other way.  But it's like these are radio people and we're on the radio and they're fucking running 
[01:40:00]  away from it.  Yeah.  Giving them exposure for their channel.  We learned about the Celtic nonsense.  Yeah.  Celtic.  Oh.  Celtic.  It's just Boston Celtic highlights all day long.  Yeah.  Robert Parrish talked from Rune to Three.  Dennis Johnson highlights.  Oh, wow.  A picture of the Bluetooth.  Yeah, see?  Yes.  Look at that.  That's stupid.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Sam.  Kenny is looking at people at the end of the hallway and yelling, psst, and leaning this 
[01:40:30]  way.  What a creep.  And they're staring at him, but they're walking slowly.  Let's make it less obvious and then maybe we'll catch a few more.  Okay.  All right.  Here's a little...  Body check them as they walk by.  Here's a little mess up.  We might...  Who's that?  Is that E-Rock?  You can't tell who these people are until they get halfway down the hall.  It's like, is it E-Rock?  I was out of position.  You missed one, Sam. 
[01:41:00]  I was hiding.  Is that the guy that...  Oh, no.  That's not the guy that bolted by us before.  All right.  Here's a mess up at a baseball game.  What?  What, E-Rock?  There's people hiding behind the other hallway because they don't want to come down here  now.  So go down there.  Do we have a wireless yet?  No.  How hilarious is that?  This is so going to end, though.  Oh, that's right.  This is going to end with...  No, but it's not...  This is going to end with, you know, you can't be harassing.  This is a place of business.  You told us it would be great to be here to get what's going on here.  Exactly.  Get the energy of the place.  The energy, the vibe. 
[01:41:30]  That's what we're doing.  And by that, they mean shut the door and the curtains and shut up.  Leave everyone alone.  Mars just found 50 more feet of Ford.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, now we're going...  Mars is just patching cords together to go everywhere.  Exactly.  It's rocks.  You're such an asshole.  People are peeking.  I see people peeking.  Oh, are they?  Yes.  All right, Sam.  What?  We're setting up the cord.  Then you're going to, like, you're going to rush them.  Okay.  Why would they talk to me?  I don't know.  As Sam sets up the next...  Mars sets up the next 100 feet of cord. 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  Let me play this for everybody.  The season opens with Chicago White Sox.  It has been put on ice.  Snow and high winds postpone.  Oh, see.  This guy had something on his mind, huh?  He certainly did.  The season opens with Chicago White Sox.  It has been put on ice.  Snow and high winds postpone.  Hey, Sam.  Knock on the door and give this to the gay channel.  They might like this one.  All right, here.  Say we want to share some bits with you guys.  It's called OutQ, Opie, by the way. 
[01:42:30]  What did I say?  You called the gay channel.  OutQ.  I'm sorry.  It's just, why can't they be guys, gay guys, and talk about other things?  It's not just a gay channel.  It's called OutQ.  OutQ.  And they talk about all kinds of topics, I'm sure.  These are some of the people who are peeking.  Ooh, peekers.  Oh, someone's rolling a cart down the hallway here.  He has gifts for us.  Full of equipment and stuff.  Yeah, these are a lot of people.  What's your name?  Kim.  What was that? 
[01:43:00]  Kim.  Kim, what do you do here at SiriusXM?  I'm an electrician.  Oh.  Cool.  I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony show.  I like to interview people in the hallway when we move somewhere.  That way we get to know the neighbors.  Okay, that's cool.  Do you like being here at SiriusXM?  I love it.  How come people aren't coming down this hallway anymore?  I don't know.  Probably because Opie and Anthony are down here now, I'm going to get harassed.  What do you mean harassed?  We're just meeting people.  I thought this was like, this is inter-office mingling.  It's what happens in corporate America. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, yeah, but people, you know, you might have some people that are like a little intimidated by that.  Sam, ask if the word about us here is not good.  What's the word about Opie and Anthony?  Is it not good?  Yeah, it's not good.  Oh, damn.  Opie, I knew it.  Thank you very much.  All right.  At least she's honest.  Yeah.  Finally, some honesty.  Yeah, all right.  What about the other guy, Sam?  You didn't want him?  He's gone now.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Very good.  The word is not good. 
[01:44:00]  Not good.  Of course not.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Like the dicks that we thought they are, they are.  Bothering everyone in the hallway.  Yeah.  Being pains in the asses.  God damn, man.  I just don't get it.  Why?  Look at Mars setting up.  Mars is now setting out more wire.  Oh, my God.  This can go all the way down the hallway now and get those people that are trying to hide.  Sam is easily 40 feet down the hallway. 
[01:44:30]  Who needs wireless?  Oh, my God.  We got so much wireless.  He's going to have to rappel down the side of the building in the event of a fire.  There he goes.  All right.  He's just fixing it up.  Oh, Jesus.  What's wrong, Sam?  I knew we just had a bad rap.  We get a bad rap.  Well, forget we were attacking this company and they were attacking us for a long time.  Yes.  We were, you know, enemies.  We were across the street. 
[01:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  Now we're just happy to be part of the merger slash rape.  Uh-oh.  She got a flat screen TV on there?  What happened?  They're taking someone's TV out.  Someone's been fired.  No, that just...  Gotcha.  Whose flat screens are those?  These are for you guys.  Oh, fantastic.  What's your name, sir?  My name is Albert.  Is that a heavy TV?  No, it's light.  Oh, good for you.  Someone should be following them with some Heineken.  It brings up something else. 
[01:45:30]  We're such dicks.  We demand so much.  Just let them touch it.  We have eight TVs in here.  Yeah.  And they're giving us another two in our office.  And there are other people that work for Sirius XM very mad at the amount of TVs that we have.  Yeah.  Extremely mad.  We need all these.  What's up, Mars?  Cut six for a second.  Why?  I like hearing this dumb banter between you two. 
[01:46:00]  No, it's the pop that it's going to make when they unplug it.  All right.  Might damage some of the equipment.  I got you.  Oh, that got quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they make a lot of noise out in that hallway.  They sure do.  A bunch of fucking nosy Nancys peeking their heads in our studio.  Trotting about.  They got binoculars down the hall and they're taking a look at us.  Was that one of our interns?  Who?  That little...  Jesus, Jimmy.  That was not me.  Oh, he said to turn it back up now.  Was that Danny?  Yeah.  They're on.  All right, Danny.  This is just going to be a stink fucking room. 
[01:46:30]  I know it.  I had a lot of Easter eggs.  Sam, we are making our way down the hallway where all the people are.  What a tangled mess of wire now.  They didn't unroll it good in a responsible manner.  Now it's all tangled up.  I couldn't see, but now I can.  This glass window is the worst thing that could possibly happen.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  No, we got curtains and stuff.  We told them we were just going to come in here and mess around today.  We're just meeting some people.  That's all.  It's corporate America.  It's called mingling.  Hey, we got a coffee machine here?  I'm sure we do somewhere.  That's where people hang out, the coffee machine.  It's true.  Let's go photograph our balls and asshole.  That's what I'm getting at.  Who wants to throw out the first balls and asshole on the coffee machine?  I'm going to pass being that it's right outside Bladder's office.  Oh, really?  Oh, it is?  Pretty much. 
[01:47:30]  Oops.  I know where nothing is here, by the way.  I have no idea.  I haven't lost it for 40 minutes.  I don't know where anything is.  Sam.  I think I pissed at the traffic studio.  Well, it looks like the headphone wire is in a heck of a knot, but we're undoing it now.  Okay.  Language.  That's right.  Yeah.  I knew when I saw Mars walk down with that big thing of wire, it was just going to be  a big mess.  How far can you get?  What are those people doing down at the end of the hall?  Those are the ones that don't want to come this way.  So we're going to them. 
[01:48:00]  Who are they?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  Yeah.  We're going to get there.  As long as we can get this headphone wire all sorted out.  He has a whole fucking collection of people down at the end who just won't come this way.  Yeah, like halfway down the building is a metal railing that kind of, I guess the hallway  is over there.  I don't even know.  I don't know where I am in the fucking building.  You hit that railing, you take a left, then another right, and then another right, you  got the bathroom.  Past the railing, it gets really douchy.  The elevators. 
[01:48:30]  It gets really douchy.  Get out of here.  With corporate guys.  I'm going to need to know how to make a beeline out of this joint.  I can't wait until Sam stops somebody and goes, what's the haps?  And the guy goes, what do you mean?  I'm Mel.  Oh, let me fire Sam on the spot.  Oh, we'll take joy in that one.  Why?  Oh, sorry, Sam.  I can hear you.  That's what the headphone wire is for.  Someone's coming up behind you.  Who's that?  That's one of our interns.  He's sashaying.  I alerted you.  We can't tell because they're so far away.  Excuse me, sir.  What's your name?  Paul. 
[01:49:00]  Paul, what do you do here at SiriusXM?  I'm an imaging producer.  Oh, what channels do you image produce?  I do a bunch.  I do Shade 45, Heart and Soul, Outlaw Country.  Shade 45, that's our neighbor.  I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you doing?  So do you like it?  That's Opie and that's Anthony and that's Jim Norton.  And that is Danny.  All right.  Welcome.  We're just meeting everyone here.  Do you like it here at SiriusXM?  I do.  How long do you think it'll be before it's just Sirius again? 
[01:49:30]  Never.  Really?  Never.  Sam, ask him.  Did people know that we were coming to the facility?  Did people know in advance that we were coming to the facility?  I did because I work right there.  So I've been seeing you guys do all the construction.  What's the vibe been like?  Positive or quite negative?  Positive, of course.  Really?  No.  How come people don't want us here?  I want all the TVs you guys got in there.  I'm jealous.  Yeah, we got eight TVs.  Yeah, we're hoarding. 
[01:50:00]  We're hoarding the TVs.  We really are.  They're a bunch of assholes.  Yeah.  We keep the same channel on a few of them just because we like it.  No, it's the same channels.  I told them in my contract, I don't crook my neck more than seven degrees to look at  a television.  How many TVs do the other studios have, Sam, that have been here for years?  Hey, how many TVs do the other studios have?  I have no idea.  I know I have none.  How about in Shade 45, one of the big channels here?  Maybe a couple.  I don't know.  Eight? 
[01:50:30]  No, no.  Eight?  We have eight.  And also, we have two offices, and each office has two televisions.  So, we got ten total so far.  We have ten TVs.  Twelve TVs.  I hear we're going up to twelve, right.  Yes.  So, Sam, everyone that walks by, I want you to tell them that we have two offices and  twelve televisions.  That's what you tell everybody, and then you say who you are.  Jim Norton was just saying we have two offices.  Well, he knows.  He can hear me.  But it's got to be emphasized.  Again, two offices and twelve televisions. 
[01:51:00]  We really have twelve TVs.  Yeah.  How come people don't like the Opie and Anthony show here?  Well, I know where their studio is, so I'm going to come take one when you're not in  there.  Well, we're worried about those guys over there, if you know what I mean.  They're bolted to the wall.  Very secure.  Have you, have you, ask if he's met Eminem here.  Have you met Eminem working at Shade 45?  Nah, I've seen him.  When does he DJ?  Yeah.  Uh, never? 
[01:51:30]  No.  I think his contract says he has to DJ one time every year.  Really?  Pretty much.  Is it more or less than one time a year?  Uh, I'm going to say every day.  Wow.  So I don't get in trouble?  I'll say less.  So I don't get in trouble, yeah.  Yeah, you got to be good.  Don't, don't lose your job.  You're doing a good job not losing your job today.  No, I'm trying.  Does he try to walk quickly?  Pass out Q?  I know.  Ask him how bad he wants to leave.  How bad?  I'm going to go now. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, he's leaving now.  I couldn't ask him.  So Sam, remember.  Hi, I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's our first day here.  And this is what we have.  Okay.  Two offices.  So far.  And 12 TVs.  But say so far.  So far, yeah.  So people understand that we are expecting a lot more than what we currently have.  The wall behind Anthony, I would like some visual stimulation on it.  It's just a beige wall.  I'm not happy.  It is.  It's very, very empty.  We got to turn this into the situation room. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Just tickers and more TVs.  I guess it is, yeah.  Sam, are you ready to go down the hall?  Yeah, let's go see if we can go down a little bit.  We have Charlie, the intern, and Evan, the intern, and Jill, the intern.  Fucking Evan.  Evan walks like more of a girl than Jill does.  Yeah, it's a dumb private pile face of his.  Is that an insult to Evan or Jill?  Evan.  All right.  Just making sure.  Jill has an odd walk.  Does she?  Yeah.  Kenny's coming with a special treat. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  He's got your grapes.  Oh, thank God.  He's going to be presenting the grapes.  He's been walking down the hall of the end of these grapes.  You're amazing.  You don't realize how.  Where did Kenny get the grapes?  Oh, where did Kenny get the grapes?  Kenny.  Where did you get the grapes?  No.  Oh, that would have sucked.  Damn it, I missed.  I went to swathe it out of Kenny's hand, and I missed.  Kenny, where did you get the grapes?  You're allowed to talk today. 
[01:53:30]  Can I have one at that?  You had to take it down a street level.  Really?  Yeah, from a street vendor.  Were people annoyed as you're walking by them with the grapes?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, they don't realize what fancy men you are.  You don't realize how much of a bunch of assholes we are until, like, we have to do all this stuff in front of people.  Don't put yourself down, G.H.  G.H.  All right.  Sam.  Yes.  Wow, look how far he is now.  This is as far as my headphones will take me. 
[01:54:00]  Really?  Yeah, this is it.  But your mic can go further, right?  Yes.  Oh, we're getting another headphone cable.  Oh, my God.  How much cable?  Describe the scene.  How far is Sam right now?  I can't really.  I wouldn't be able to tell that was Sam without his wacky hair.  He's that far away.  Thank God for that, then.  He's way down the hall.  There's two cables running down the hallway.  Yeah.  One for his headphones, I guess.  One for the mic.  They are now putting an extra one on the headphone cable so he can go even further. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Why couldn't we just run cables from our old studio to here?  At this point, yes.  That would have been nice.  Yeah.  We'd just stay there and run some cable.  All right.  All right.  He's working on it.  How come no one will come down this hallway?  Because I've been listening to the show.  No one likes us.  It's amazing.  We're not liked.  Hated is more accurate.  Yeah.  Like, it's so weird.  We're just not liked.  But we didn't do it. 
[01:55:00]  It's our first day.  And we already have cooties in school.  We should have Tippy Tom walking up and down these hallways already.  Oh.  But that would be fantastic.  We're like the kid that threw up at lunch.  It just sticks with you.  Where's the open empty studio?  How you doing?  Just wandering around.  I'm Tippy Tom.  Just stinking up the entire place.  Oh, boy.  Do I not want him in the studio.  Oh, in here?  Dude, it would be a gas chamber.  He'd have to be in the fucking... 
[01:55:30]  In Travis's little area back there.  Yes.  Beyond the glass.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  Out cue.  Out pew.  Actually, we're working on our next Tippy Tom bit.  Yeah?  He's going to be doing some wine tasting.  All right.  Yeah.  I got a sophisticated palate.  It's 91 points.  It's a smooth little wine.  Yeah.  This smells like a dumpster. 
[01:56:00]  14th Street.  Wait.  What is that?  Nice color.  It's like when I got kicked in the kidneys and was urinating for a week.  All right.  Thumbs up.  Cut off six for a second.  Cut off six.  Cut off six.  All right.  Six is off.  Again, we get that nice silence.  I like the hallway noise.  It's kind of nice.  A little ambient sound.  Oh, my God.  I see more wires.  How far are we taking this?  Bernie Williams from the Yankees is releasing an album or something. 
[01:56:30]  He's playing.  Yeah.  Don't talk to him that he's Bernie Williams, though.  He's been doing the music.  He gets very mad and he won't answer your question.  Oh, he's a good guitar player.  Yeah.  A jazz guy.  Is he?  Is he?  Yeah.  Let's get him in.  He plays jazz guitar.  Oh, he.  Oh, that's why.  That was good.  His wife was that one that sat behind home plate with that goddamn ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, making a noise when the other people would come up to bat.  That was Bernie's wife? 
[01:57:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  How embarrassing.  Oh, what an annoying bitch.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Shut up.  Why'd he tell her?  Stop it.  Oh, she probably wears the pants in her family.  What's going on there?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  I think we hooked up too many wires.  I think there's so many wires now.  I think there's a little resistance problem going on.  A few too many connections, a little too much wire for the signal to travel through without  a boost.  Yeah.  I'm almost at our office, which is 100 feet or more away from the studio. 
[01:57:30]  It's at least 100.  That mic was not made to be hooked up to that many cables.  You can tell.  We are way down the hall now.  It needs an extra, it needs some extra voltage.  Yes.  Now what, Sam?  Well, I don't know.  Now everyone ran away from there.  Can you give me another one?  Everybody, when I came here, as I was walking down the hall, two people jumped into these  voiceover studios.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know if they're actually recording their voices or not.  Press your balls against the window.  Like bat wings. 
[01:58:00]  Someone is suggesting we set up detour signs so they have to come this way.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Well, no one.  What do you think, Sam?  There's Troy.  I'm right by Troy's desk.  He's an all right dude.  Hey, Troy.  That means the city in upstate New York.  Come here.  Come here, Troy.  They want to talk to you.  It's a long cable.  What's going on?  They're setting up another wire. 
[01:58:30]  No way.  For real.  It's going to get more crackling for real.  Okay.  They gave me more headphones.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  He's going to be out of view now.  Yeah.  Because he's going around that corner.  Mm-hmm.  He is so far away.  We have never had anybody this far away with a wired mic.  Okay, I'm sitting down at Troy's desk with Troy.  So, Troy, what are you doing here today?  Nope. 
[01:59:00]  Nope.  Just hanging out to join the show.  Wrong.  Sam, this is opening line.  Wrong.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  How could I have forgotten?  Hi, Troy.  I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony show.  We have two offices and 12 TVs so far.  How are you?  I know.  It's been quite an ordeal getting them all to work.  But I guess they're putting the last two in right now.  Ask if he has any TVs.  I see here at your workstation you have a lot of gadgets.  How many TVs do you have?  Unfortunately, none.  But I'm going to come in and watch your guys' TV, if that's all right. 
[01:59:30]  Well, we have 12.  I know.  I know.  It's quite impressive.  For real.  We have 12 TVs.  Seriously.  We have 12.  It's not an exaggeration.  And if you count all in the studio and in our two offices, we have a total of 12 flat  screen HD TVs.  It's crazy.  It's craziness.  And on all those 12 TVs, we only watch four different channels.  How many channels do you watch on your TV here at your desk?  Absolutely none.  I'm staring at a profit screen right now. 
[02:00:00]  You don't have a TV.  That's right.  I don't.  We have 12.  We have 12 screens.  Tomorrow on all 12 TVs, I want the Yule log.  Tomorrow, Opie is going to play the Yule log on all 12 of his TVs.  Are you going to have anything to play the Yule log on?  Unfortunately, no.  They should put it out in the lobby, too.  The Yule log?  We have more TVs than the lobby.  Yeah.  I know.  We have two offices.  I know.  It's crazy.  Tell them we have so many TVs so the talent doesn't have to crank their necks. 
[02:00:30]  The reason that we have a lot of people have been saying, why do you guys have 12 TVs?  It's because the talent, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, doesn't like to crick their necks.  It's understandable.  I mean, you know, you've got to deliver radio gold, so you don't want to stay too far out.  If Troy understands, you should start telling him that we need some of his space.  Listen, Troy, I see you do have a really nice station here, but you have a lot of space for one person.  Don't you think? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Just send somebody over here.  Somebody else can join.  Well, I mean, because your desk is close to our office, so if we kind of brought our office...  Knock this workstation out, and it'll give you guys a little more room.  So maybe your desk here could be half the size?  That's fine.  I'll slide down one.  I'll go down there.  Oh, this is thrilling banter.  Yeah.  Way to know when to, you know, bail, Sam.  Good idea.  Ask how tall he is.  Right.  All right, Troy.  Look at Mars running the 100-yard sprint. 
[02:01:30]  Mars has to run.  Mars' hair doesn't even bounce when he runs.  What creepy hair Mars has.  He just ran down the hallway.  He was running forever.  What the hell is going on in this place?  E-Rock is telling me that Kane is in one of the voice booths.  Oh.  We're fans of Kane.  I know.  He did well at WrestleMania last weekend.  Who's Kane?  What was he doing at WrestleMania, sir?  Oh, wait.  Not Kane the music jock.  I only know one Kane. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, see, he...  This doesn't look like Kane.  He thinks it's Kane from wrestling, but it's the jock.  It's Kane from All Nation.  Yes, it is.  He used to work at K-Rock.  It's Kane from All Nation.  Oh, he used to work at Ethel.  He's in Studio 30, which is much smaller than our studio.  I see that.  Really?  All right, we're going to take a break, Sam.  Okay.  And we're going to regroup.  We're going to get to know more people here at SiriusXM.  Wait, Ope, do you think that Sam's Troy interview is boring?  Oh, boy, do I.  What happened?  Sam's Troy interview stinks. 
[02:02:30]  That was fucking horrible.  The lemon.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  A lemon.  Troy was just going with everything and, you know, come on, Sam.  What could I do here?  Well, we'll have to find somebody else.  You're going to have to...  Everybody wants me to...  Oh, some guy just opened...  Hello, sir.  What's your name?  Jim.  Jim, I'm Sam from the Opey and Anthony show.  We have a studio and two offices and 12 TVs. 
[02:03:00]  So far.  So far.  How many TVs do you have here at Sirius?  There's just one monitor in this room.  Tell me maybe taking that soon.  Now, if we needed to take that monitor for our office...  No.  I've got to do a show.  I've got to go.  Oh, he's got to...  He's shutting the door.  Oh, that's it.  He's not happy.  If I've got to take that monitor...  Let them know, like, whatever their thing is, say the rumor is we're getting your TV. 
[02:03:30]  Tell them that.  The rumor is we're getting that.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  We're not going to be happy until this whole wall is covered with everyone else's TV.  The talent doesn't like to crank their necks, and the talent likes a lot of visual stimulation.  This is why everybody's in such a crabby mood.  Yeah.  I thought people were opening their voiceover studios to talk.  Yeah.  Kenny is lumbering outside the voiceover studios and knocking on doors while people are trying  to do shows. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, that's going to be trouble.  People forgot to have, you know...  Fun.  Fun.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, they forgot to have fun.  It's radio.  All right.  Should we break or interview this guy again?  Oh.  Hello, sir.  What was your name again?  Not again.  How many TV and TV have?  He left.  He goes, Sam is a thing.  Did he say not again?  Yes.  Not again.  He said not again.  Oh, we're making friends.  Shade has, like, I think four, but three of them are on shoulders. 
[02:04:30]  Oh.  Good morning, sir.  What's your name?  Oh, Louie.  Louie, I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony show.  We have two offices and 12 TVs.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You got caught up on our cables.  We have a lot of cables as well, but more TVs.  How many TVs do you have in your studio here?  None.  What kind of studio is this here?  I do mostly chiropractic work here.  On the radio?  What?  I see you have a drum set in the studio. 
[02:05:00]  If we needed to take that, because the rumor is we would need a drum set for our studio,  you wouldn't put up too much of it.  He said he was going to shoot me, and then he walked into the studio.  Oh.  Yeah, he just kind of wanted to avoid you.  Shut the door in your face.  I think that's the guy that does jingles for the whole place.  I think so, too.  He seemed like a nice guy.  They're a jingle guy, for real.  Do they?  Yeah.  A jingle guy?  We're setting up more wires, by the way.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  So we can reach every single person here.  How much more wires, Sam? 
[02:05:30]  Look at Mars.  He's leaving the studio with another whole roll.  Yes.  Evan, the intern, is extending the microphone wire, so I can only assume Mars has come to  extend my headphone wire.  It's ridiculous.  Hmm.  Hopefully, we'll get to meet some new friends today.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy, you're taking a picture.  Too late, Jimmy.  I already did that one.  You did what? 
[02:06:00]  Sorry.  You did one now.  Opie radio.  No, yours didn't come up.  Good.  Jim Norton at Twitter.  I actually have more followers than anybody in this studio.  Really?  48,000 followers.  Because you whore yourself out.  I lied.  Oh, okay.  I don't.  I just want him to be Mr. Big Shot.  It's the worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Hey, it's Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony radio program.  Welcoming all the new subscribers. 
[02:06:30]  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Hello.  Describe the show a bit.  It's shitty.  Thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony present the worst of 2009.  Hosted by Sam and...  Eric.  Opie and Anthony, I just ran down to the kitchen to check out all the free stuff you could get. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Very cool.  They have a vending machine with every beverage you could imagine.  For free?  For free.  How do they afford that?  You would think that would be the first thing to go.  First thing that's got to go.  They've got to fire the vending machine.  Under these tough economic times.  Yes.  And then they have a whole thing of milk that's shipped in every day.  The cough.  It's just amazing. 
[02:07:30]  That's the best radio kitchen I've ever worked at.  And there's also a...  Free pretzels.  Yeah.  Golden rods.  I love golden rods.  Oh, I thought you meant the big soft kind.  No.  That would be good.  No.  You've got the ones that you can shove up your ass nicely.  Exactly.  I love to be fucked by my food before I eat it.  That's right.  If you remember, though, the cafeteria thing that they had at the XM facility down in D.C.  That was great.  That was pretty good.  That was amazing, actually. 
[02:08:00]  See?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that place.  Yeah.  They had that.  They had a big gym.  It was a full cafeteria.  You didn't have to leave the compound to eat lunch.  That worked out well financially in the end, didn't it?  Yeah, it certainly did.  We're the last ones standing, I think.  They got rid of everybody.  Yeah.  I mean everybody.  Don's still around, but he's miserable.  Wicklund's around.  Wickie?  Yeah, Wickie's miserable.  He's still around?  Yep.  Wow.  He's doing all right.  Who did he blow for his job? 
[02:08:30]  Who didn't he?  Even people that couldn't affect his job at all.  What are you doing?  I work in the mailroom.  Well, just in case.  Hey, by the way, it's the witching hour, 9 o'clock.  Oh, is this one everybody?  No.  No.  What?  We're the, you know, the work bees.  Now, you know, the queen bees have arrived.  Oh, the, uh.  The designer glass, oops, designer glass guys.  Glasses guys.  Now Sam can reach the conference room.  So we're going to go back to Sam in a few seconds here. 
[02:09:00]  We had someone bitching about us already.  What time is he on?  Because I guess we took his studio and not happy that we have 12 TVs.  Who would be?  What time is he on?  I don't know.  I think you guys are competing morning shows.  Really?  Are we?  It's like a fucking studio is like a Best Buy.  It really.  We do have a ridiculous amount of television.  All right.  Hopefully, if we can't play the audio, then we're going to do a little, uh.  We have our transcriptions.  We're going to do a little play. 
[02:09:30]  A little acting.  E-Rock's going to be the lead for this one because we don't have David today.  And we can't wait until tomorrow when David is here.  Sam, all the way down the hall.  That's right.  And with more cable than ever.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  We have a lot of cords.  We have two interns now following me around with bundles of cords that are plugged in.  We should brag about how much cord we have.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Well, who's around here?  What type of person would you like to talk to today?  Well, it's up to you, Sam.  You're down there. 
[02:10:00]  Exactly.  We can't even see you anymore.  Okay.  Unfortunately, we can hear you.  Yeah.  Well, uh, we have this gentleman who's listening to our show right now.  Oh.  Uh, what you may not know about our show, sir, is I'm Sam from Opie and Anthony, and these  two offices here are both for our show, and we also have 12 TVs so far.  What do you have?  I have a studio that, no joke, was a closet four years ago that they turned into a studio.  Where is this closet?  It means it literally.  It's actually, uh, down the hall from your guys' studio. 
[02:10:30]  Okay, because we have some extra stuff from the old place, so we may have to go ahead  and take over that, uh, closet for some of our stuff, if you could kind of move maybe  a couple of your things out.  We have a couple TVs that we haven't found room to hang up yet, so we may need your,  to use your, uh, area as a storage facility.  Is that okay?  That's fine, I guess, because all the suits are kind of been, like, pissing themselves  for, like, four months since all of a sudden it's been announced you guys were coming  here, so I guess they would make me do it anyway. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  What's your name?  My name's Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Yes.  Ask Steve, uh, what the vibe is on us finally coming here, Sam.  Now that we're finally here, what's, what's been the vibe on us?  I think it's kind of funny, actually, but I'm pretty sure the suits have all been running  around, like, really scared that you guys were coming and wondering if they were going  to get harassed in the hallways.  That's why I think they're hiding in their glass aquariums.  Why is everyone so scared of us just meeting new people? 
[02:11:30]  Uh, I think that because the other type of show here, like yours, or, like Howard, is kind  of in the back, but you guys are out in front, so I think they're scared that, uh, as they  walk by, they will be harassed.  Hmm.  Oh, I see.  All right, well, we'll move on to the next person, but thanks for your time, Steve.  No problem.  All right, who else is around here?  Diet Pepsi sucks.  Yeah, it's, if you're gonna drink, just...  How far...  Why were you drinking that?  I'm gay.  Oh.  I'm seeing, uh... 
[02:12:00]  Gay.  How far we can go down, because...  A couple of these areas are empty, and that's...  People run away from you.  Is that what it is?  I thought maybe they just hadn't gotten here yet.  No.  Well...  They're avoiding you.  Have you seen anyone with designer glasses yet?  Not yet, but not to worry, because we're gonna go ahead and plug in another, uh, headphone  wire right now.  Look how far he is.  I can't see him.  I really can't see him. 
[02:12:30]  He's almost a dot.  Sam, you're almost a dot.  Okay, well, I'm all...  I mean...  If it wasn't for that huge afro of yours, we wouldn't know it was you.  No, I couldn't distinguish him from anybody.  All right, you guys hook up the next wire, and we'll, uh, we'll continue here.  Okay, yeah, we're all hooked up.  Um, should I keep...  Oh, I think, uh, Kane from, uh, formerly of K-Rock is here.  Hi, Kane?  I'm Sam from Opie and Anthony.  We just moved in, and we have two offices and 12 TVs so far. 
[02:13:00]  What do you have?  That's...  I have a mouthful of pretzel.  That's what I have.  Thanks for asking.  Are you excited now that Opie and Anthony and their 12 TVs have moved into Sirius XM?  I'm very excited, because now I get to see, uh, you know, them and their 12 TVs.  And all their...  I get to see Jim Norton come out of the bathroom, which is really good.  Yeah.  Sure.  A lot of fun.  So, what kind of stuff do you have here?  What do you...  What is this?  What are you doing?  What is this?  Oh, we're going around and meeting, uh, some of the new people that we're going to be neighbors  with here at Sirius XM.  Uh, what do I have? 
[02:13:30]  I don't have...  I get to borrow a little booth for a couple hours a day.  I've got nothing, man.  There's all the room in this place.  So, you're very lucky.  Jesus.  They have these tiny little studios.  They're...  He's right.  They're like booths.  And you go in there and you do your show for a couple hours, and then you go home.  I don't get it.  Where is the...  It's a giant building.  Right.  What's...  Yeah, we're on the air live right now.  You're on the air live?  Well, I didn't know that.  I thought you were doing...  Dicking around out here.  No, no.  He is.  We're live on the radio.  I got you.  All right.  Fine. 
[02:14:00]  Um, what's the vibe been like here at Sirius, uh, leading up to Opie and Anthony and the  show arriving?  Very tense.  Really?  Yes.  Very...  We've been waiting, you know, because, you know, we heard they were all dicks.  And so...  Really?  Yeah.  I kept trying to tell people, saying, oh, you had nothing to worry about, you know,  I've briefly had a run-in with them a time or two, but, uh, we're all very excited that  you're here.  I can't believe they put your studio up so quick.  Just yesterday, it was all wires.  Sam, tell them, uh, Opie and Anthony are listening to you, and that we're way past the,  uh, the problems we used to have with Kane, and I'm a huge fan. 
[02:14:30]  Opie and Anthony are listening to you, obviously.  It's weird not being able to hear them, and just staring at you with these funny faces you're  making as you're listening.  Well, Opie just wanted to let you know that they're way past their stuff that they had  with you, and Opie's actually a...  Perfect.  All theater.  It wasn't ever really stuff that they had.  It was just all theater, man.  It was fun.  Sam...  I thought it was great.  Cabbie, they can hate all they want.  Yeah.  Sam, you crapped out just when you were going to say that we were big fans.  One of the amateur interns was messing with the microphone cord. 
[02:15:00]  Wait, what kind of intern are you, then?  I'm not an intern.  That's why I get to be the one holding the mic, and all these people follow me.  Ah, okay.  I got you.  I used to be an intern, but...  Tell Kane I'll be listening to him later on Alt Nation.  Opie will be listening to you later on Alt Nation.  And I will be listening to them every day.  Fantastic.  Good to see you.  You too.  Thank you.  Kane's all right.  He's all right.  I remember one time we all had a little free time in between shows, and we bumped into Kane 
[02:15:30]  over at, I believe it was Show World, or one of those places.  Was he over there?  Remember that?  We all ended up at some strip club.  I remember that much.  It was me, you, Kane.  I'm honestly trying to remember.  And I think we had to go to work.  Oh, with the stripper with the knee jobs?  Yes!  Knee jobs for lunch.  Knee jobs, that's what it was.  Knee jobs for lunch.  These strippers had this gimmick where they would just, like, kind of sit you down and 
[02:16:00]  then do that thing where they'd kind of grab your legs and kind of shake their hair on  your face and shit like that.  And they were making believe they weren't making contact.  Yeah.  Using their knee.  Their knee would be right in your crotch area, and she'd start pumping and pushing against  your boner with her kneecap.  Did you dump?  Nah.  Very hard to dump in that situation.  It's not easy to make.  You're just laughing.  I made commsies in that situation.  Yeah, yeah.  I made commsies in my pants twice due to strippers. 
[02:16:30]  No way.  Right through your pants?  Once in New Orleans, I was down there doing a college with Pete Correale.  And this guy, Louis.  Yeah, Pete's good, though.  He can make you cum real easy.  Pete can just by talking to me.  He's so funny, his act just makes me cum.  But no, it was me, Pete and Louis Ramies, who went into the strip club.  And in the back, it was like a tourist trap.  So she's giving me like $20 lap dances.  And she's like, for $300, we could go in this quiet room.  And I know it's a scam.  So I'm like, all right, just give me a couple of minutes.  And I had on silk boxers. 
[02:17:00]  And she was grinding.  I'm like, yeah, maybe we can.  What will happen up there?  You can have a really good time.  And then she's...  What does that mean?  Exactly.  When the ass cheeks are separated over the dick and they're moving, all of a sudden, a  fucking fire hose of activity in my pants.  All of your silk boxers.  I was like, nah, I'm all set.  And I walked out with a fucking giant stain on my boxers.  And I showed Pete and Louis on Bourbon Street.  That's great.  That is all right.  The silk probably is what did it, right? 
[02:17:30]  Well, when it happened in Vegas, this Russian stripper, they normally annoy me.  It was the best lap dance I've ever gotten.  I got 11 lap dances from her.  It cost me $220.  And I knew she's just a stripper.  And she still had me convinced that she liked me.  And she was kind of riding me with her ass cheeks on my boner.  And then looking back over her shoulder at me, just slowly rocking on my cock.  And boy, did I fucking blast off my pants.  Wonderful.  Very sensitive boy.  Not normally.  It took 11 lap dances. 
[02:18:00]  Jesus, Jimmy.  Were you chafed?  You sure it wasn't blood and pus?  I got an idea for tomorrow's show.  Oh, sure.  Where's Mars?  I want a wall of sound in honor of Phil Spector, who's going to jail, I guess, or...  Well, second-degree murder.  Second-degree murder.  Blah, blah, blah.  Way to seg that story into the program today.  But in honor of Phil Spector, I want a wall of sound outside the studio so we can blast a drill-do bit to the entire floor.  Okay, that could be a problem. 
[02:18:30]  You just know.  Where's Steve?  Let's ask for permission to do this, and I want to find out what they say.  Get Steve in here.  No.  Get Steve in here.  I bet they would.  Mars.  Mars, but can we set up a wall of sound pretty much outside the studio?  Bunch of speakers that broadcast the show?  I hate this possible.  Yeah?  All right, good.  I like your attitude, Mars.  You want me to get Steve in here?  Yeah.  And if we can't do the drill-do bit, we'll still have a wall of sound so we can broadcast to the entire floor anyway. 
[02:19:00]  What if they want to hear their own stations and not listen to us?  Please.  We're the only reason.  Please.  To have...  Come on.  We don't know.  And David's going to be here tomorrow?  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Whoa!  We got approval on the audio.  They said no?  We're still...  It still needs to be worked on.  What is it...  What is it going to be worked on?  It's so easy to just say yes or no...  What is the work arm for?  For someone...  Are they editing it? 
[02:19:30]  ...to make a goddamn decision?  Somebody was trashing us.  Just make a decision.  Steve.  Hey.  Ask Bladder.  Tomorrow we want to set up a wall of sound, for real.  Like a whole wall of speakers.  Okay.  And we want to broadcast our drill-do bit to the entire floor.  Okay.  I will absolutely ask him.  Right now.  And then get back to us and tell us what he said.  Of course.  Well, we're going to find out about corporate policy in about five minutes.  Yeah.  I want to know why they can't just...  Like... 
[02:20:00]  Here's the recording we have.  We want to play it.  Yeah.  Some guy trashed us.  Someone make a decision.  That's what it is.  There's too many chiefs.  I don't know.  Let's last this one.  No, no, no.  Well, we'll sit on it a while.  We'll do this.  We'll do...  Someone go yes or no.  God.  Evan does have the weirdest walk.  Holy shit.  He's always pushing to the left.  All right.  What the fuck is going on there?  That's not real, right?  He's like crazy legs.  McGillicuddy.  He pushes to the left.  He's got to adjust every step. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, his legs are wobbling like he's got rubber band legs.  Yeah.  He's doing the Forrest Gump dance when Elvis was staying at the house.  Hey, fucking ball bearing hips.  What a creepy walk.  You really don't get to see...  I never saw any of these interns walking this far, ever.  Now they can come right at you looking down the hallway.  And that walk was ridiculous. 
[02:21:00]  Well, how about we...  Is that a problem?  Did he have polio?  I don't know.  We're trying to find out.  But he's busy doing something that's, I guess, more important...  What's he doing?  ...than finding out the answer to the question that we want to know the answer to.  Evan.  All right.  We never noticed the way you fucking...  Yeah.  What's up with your walk?  We never noticed before until we watched you walk 600 yards down the hallway that you  have kind of a unique stride.  I do.  Is that your arm?  It's been called a few things.  Get right on mic. 
[02:21:30]  Waddle by some.  Sam likes to call it a sashay.  Sashay.  Yeah.  It is almost like a model walks down a runway and their hips kind of move.  It's sort of that.  And it looks kind of rubber band-y.  Why are you so sexy?  Well, I have crooked hips.  I don't know what else to say.  What's wrong with your fucking hips, Nana?  I have crooked hips.  How old are you?  22.  22 crooked hips.  They developed incorrectly. 
[02:22:00]  Can you please just walk down the hall?  I didn't really get a chance to see.  I want to see so we can talk about it.  Walk down...  Yeah.  Walk down to the end of the runway.  Yeah.  Can you put a skirt on him?  If he walks the other way...  What's he doing?  All right.  We got to put a tight dress on him.  He's got crooked.  It is crooked hips.  I don't know what that is.  Awful.  His lower half is moving independently of his upper half. 
[02:22:30]  His upper half looks stiff and the bottom half looks like the keep on trucking thing?  Yeah.  What a crooked idiot.  Well, he just says, I have crooked hips.  Were we supposed to laugh at that point?  Of course we were.  How do you not?  We were supposed to be sympathetic, but fuck him.  All right.  Well, we're going to have to read the script again.  Why don't we read this?  Keep on trucking, guy.  Why don't we read the script?  How many parts do we need?  I think only two.  Who is this douchebag that was... 
[02:23:00]  It's Alex Bennett.  We took his studio.  Too bad.  I don't know.  We didn't ask for it.  They just gave it to us.  He was like a name in the 70s, I think.  He was big in San Francisco radio, I do believe.  That's when he made his kind of mark in the business.  That's so angry.  And he's not happy that we're taking over his studio and we got TVs.  And then he goes for the typical Howard Stern crap with us.  Oh, maybe that's what they're cutting out? 
[02:23:30]  Where's E-Rock to play Alex?  And then we need someone to play Albert.  Who hasn't been on the air yet?  Travis can play Albert.  What a fucking douchebag.  I'm reading the transcript.  What a fucking douchebag this guy is.  I'm 40 and I've never heard of him.  I'm sure they're going to give away...  Oh, okay.  Like they do for everyone else's?  I don't even know what he means.  I can't tell what's sarcastic and what's stupidity. 
[02:24:00]  E-Rock, you're going to play the part of Alex Bennett.  And Travis, you're going to play Albert.  Who's Albert, Danny?  I guess he's his co-host.  Co-host or like a board guy that gets to talk a little bit.  I don't know.  I haven't heard...  I just heard the excerpt.  So from it, I couldn't tell exactly what his role was.  Are they on right now?  I do believe so.  Are they in the building here?  He's off at nine, I think.  Off at nine?  Six to nine, I think.  Six to nine?  Aha, stupid.  Hope you're listening.  Fucking three-hour show.  Beat it. 
[02:24:30]  Ugh.  An asshole.  What a douchebag.  Wow, what the fuck did we ever do to this fucking asshole?  Made it.  Took your studio.  How does it feel to be in the business that long and just have your studio took?  This guy is like angry.  Oh, it's bitter.  Yeah, there's some real bitterness in here.  We've never even talked about this guy.  Let's just fucking...  Fuck this cocksucker.  All right.  You got microphones?  One.  We have one.  One.  Great.  I'm sure he does a great radio show that I've never heard.  All right.  This is Alex Bennett, played by E-Rock, and Travis will be playing Albert. 
[02:25:00]  And if we get to the approval, we'll play the audio, too.  Can we see a picture of this douchebag?  Yeah.  What the hell?  Masterpiece theater, right?  Yeah.  Just Google irrelevant.  I'll make it bigger.  Ugh.  Jesus.  That's him? 
[02:25:30]  It looks like the madness.  That fucking...  That balding old man?  How old is he?  Looks like he used to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.  What is wrong?  Looks like Chef from Apocalypse Now.  Yeah, a little bit.  All right, let's go.  Looks like Chef, and I hope he winds up the same way with his fucking dopey head in Brando's lap.  All right, go ahead there, E-Rock.  Get us going.  I'm sure they're going to do a press release like they do for everyone's fifth anniversary.  I'm sure they're going to have a party.  I'm sure they're going to give away prizes. 
[02:26:00]  Right, Albert?  Oh, yeah.  They'll do that right after they finish building the Opie and Anthony Studios.  Just right after that, they'll do that, because they're important.  Apparently.  Have you seen the new offices?  Already they have two flat-screen TVs in their studio.  Well, we're up to four.  We're going to get an eight in here.  Well, have you seen their offices?  There's going to be two flat-screen TVs in their offices, too.  Well, when do we get our flat-screen?  Maybe we'll get one for the anniversary. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe there's one left over from Opie and Anthony's move.  Their offices are nice.  Jeez almighty.  Why don't we get that?  Why do they need a flat screen in their office?  They have four of them.  We have four and you have none.  Everyone's so angry about these flat screens.  Exactly.  And let it be known, because this is a week ago, we're up to 12 now.  They said, what, we had two in studio.  We now have officially eight.  Eight in studio.  And they were bitching when we had two in here. 
[02:27:00]  Back up a little bit.  Wait, can someone go grab a photo of their studio?  Oh, fantastic.  Can we find out what fucking shoebox they're in and get a photo of it?  Back up a little bit.  They were bitching when there were only two flat screens in here.  We're up to eight.  Go ahead.  Jeez almighty.  Why don't we get that?  Why do they need a flat screen in their office?  They have four of them.  In the office?  And not just those little monitors we have in the studio.  What do they need that for?  What are they, like a news operation? 
[02:27:30]  They're only on a lousy three hour a day show.  Wait, wait, wait, what?  You're on a lousy three hour a day show, stupid.  We're on a five hour a day show.  Five hours, you dumb cunt.  You're on three hours, and that's why you're fucking in the car right now.  This guy.  Asshole.  In the office?  And not just those little monitors we have here in the studio.  What do they need that for?  What are they, like a news operation?  They're only a lousy three hour a day show.  They're big stars.  Haven't they heard you can do a talk show with three people? 
[02:28:00]  They have a great agent.  Why not?  You're doing one with three listeners.  Nobody cares about you.  How does that feel?  Wow.  You know what?  I've had satellite for five years.  I didn't even know Alex Bennett was doing a satellite radio show.  Dude, I swear to God, I've never heard of him.  We just gave him some marketing today.  I had no idea.  No clue.  Go ahead.  Track two, I guess.  It's ridiculous.  For them, they haven't been too successful in the last few years, have they?  I don't know.  They lost their FM stations. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  That doesn't sound like much success.  So they have all this, so they pretty much wound up being me.  Yes.  But they're you with a bunch of flat screens.  You're right.  You didn't do the fist on the console.  Follow the directions in the polecticies.  Yeah.  You're right.  That's what they are.  They're me with a bunch of, I want a flat screen in here.  But Opie and Anthony are the poor man's Howard, right?  Yeah, there you go.  I wouldn't say that.  Why? 
[02:29:00]  Because it's a different act.  Thank you, Albert.  Oh, it's a different act?  Yeah.  Yeah, Howard's good and they're terrible.  You think I'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio?  Do you think they'll come over and say they're happy?  We're all at the same place together?  No.  In fact, I think that when they find out you were saying nasty things about them.  They'll try to get me fired.  Well, they'll first make sure you don't do that anymore.  Then get some of the bosses to say, hey, Alex, don't do that anymore.  First of all, let me interject here.  We don't do that. 
[02:29:30]  No.  We get on the air and beat the shit out of you.  You then get beat up so badly that you usually run to the bosses and tell us to stop.  That's the way it's worked in every situation we've been in.  We pull out the atomic bomb.  We drop it on whoever's giving us shit.  And they turn around and say, please make them stop.  We've never told a fucking boss to make people stop talking about us. 
[02:30:00]  And it ain't happened.  We encourage our listeners to listen to your show.  I'm confident enough in this show to say our listeners should listen to your show.  And if you do a better show, then our listeners should stay there.  I think, judging by this, that you're just a cranky guy who didn't get as far as you wanted to get  and tough shit that you got booted out of your studio.  Tough shit.  You don't like it?  Fucking quit. 
[02:30:30]  And get on a flat screen.  No, you don't.  Twelve of them.  And counting.  Why don't you show video on that bald head of yours?  I'll be pounding the studio.  Wait till we bring in our personal TVs next.  Everyone bring in their extra TV from home.  I'm going to roll in a big projection television set.  We should.  Old, fake.  A screen screen is whole.  All right, back up again, Yrock.  Please.  Yeah, Howard's good and they're terrible.  You think I'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio? 
[02:31:00]  I say back up, so you had to go and get that line on the radio again.  There was only one other line.  All right, Yrock.  Sorry.  You think I'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio?  Do you think they'll come over and say that they're happy because we're all at the same  place together?  No, in fact, I think when they find out you were saying nasty things about them...  They'll try to get me fired.  Well, they'll first make sure you don't do that anymore.  They'll get some of the bosses to say, hey, Alex, don't do that anymore.  Really?  They do that? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  They always used to accuse Howard of that.  No, they'll do that to you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hey, Lapdog, this show has never done that to another radio show.  Nope.  And as far as what happened with this show and the Stern Show, look, it's common knowledge.  He admitted it on Hannity.  So don't be a fucking...  Learn what you're talking about before you start bashing a radio show, stupid.  All right, track three.  Why am I supposed to defend them?  They're not on my channel. 
[02:32:00]  I don't know.  If we don't defend them, they'll say nasty things.  We're competitors.  We'll be on the same time, right?  They'll be on the same time I am, right?  Six in the morning till...  I don't know.  Something like that.  Three in the afternoon.  I don't know.  Those shows go on forever.  Well, that's what they need, those live screen TVs so they can catch Springer.  Because they're working while he's on.  Oh, wait.  You know, hold on.  The fact it has to be read.  Do your line again and then... 
[02:32:30]  And read what's in the print.  All right.  Or can you read the...  Yeah, yeah.  When it comes to that, because that's really funny.  Actually, fucking asshole.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Three in the afternoon.  I don't know.  Those shows go on forever.  Well, that's what...  Well, that's why they need those live screen TVs so they can catch Springer.  Long, uncomfortable pause.  Because they're working while he's on.  Smells the bomb and changes the subject.  So it's...  They...  Really?  They have four in their offices? 
[02:33:00]  They will.  I love it.  I just love it.  Yeah.  You know...  You know...  I understand Howard.  I understand why he has to have all that.  I understand why he's worth it.  What a groveling...  What a fucking groveling, irrelevant man you are.  That's it.  How old is Alex Bennett?  Idiots.  How old is he?  Just do your fucking thing and...  And what channel is he on?  I've never heard of this guy.  I don't know if it's drinking. 
[02:33:30]  America left.  Oh, there you go.  The audience left.  Oh, fuck yourself.  All right.  I thought I told Mingy.  I thought I told you to go fuck your mother.  Is he from San Francisco?  Is that where he's out of?  Yeah.  What is this guy?  One of these fucking...  He was born in San Francisco.  Aged, aged, hippie fucking assholes.  Oh, yeah.  Probably, yeah.  He was born in 39.  Wow.  39?  Oh, my God.  61.  So he's 60...  He's 70.  He's going to be 70. 
[02:34:00]  He's 70.  I've never heard of that guy.  In 70 years on the earth, who are you?  Yeah.  He's lame because when Howard used to admit it, he said that Alex Bennett was one of his  influences, and now Alex Bennett is drinking the Kool-Aid.  Jesus.  Whatever.  Have fun.  Why don't we go back down the hall and say hi to Sam?  Took his studio, and he's all mad.  That's right.  We took it.  We bitched you for your studio.  Yeah.  Hand it over, bitch.  Uh-huh.  Get the fuck out.  Out. 
[02:34:30]  We piss in the corners now.  It's our fucking studio.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yeah, mark it.  Mark your territory.  Please get a picture of his studio.  Oh, it'd be great if they just put him in a fucking shoebox.  I was gonna, but there's people in there, and I think it still might be him, so.  So we'll get a picture of him.  Go ahead.  Who cares?  You're afraid of a 70-year-old man?  No, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What's he going to do?  Throw his prostate at you?  I have an iPhone.  I'll never get a good, crisp, clear picture of it.  Stop and take a picture of him.  I got Paul. 
[02:35:00]  Paul's got a digital camera.  He's going to take a picture of him.  Get a picture of him.  Fuck him.  Let's go back down to the hall as we do that.  Sam?  Hi.  What's the vibe down the hall?  Well, everyone's coming in.  Everybody's working.  They're all looking at me annoyed.  We've got lots of cable.  We're all the way down near the kitchen.  How many people could hear you right now?  Oh, at least, you know, I mean, there's a dozen or more.  How about you make one general announcement?  Okay, what would you like me to announce? 
[02:35:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony  Show.  Just want to let you know it's our first day, and so far we've got two offices with four  flat-screen TVs.  We have a studio with eight flat-screen TVs.  That makes a total of 12 flat-screen TVs and counting.  And Alex Bennett has none.  Right.  And Alex Bennett has a tiny little monitor.  At first, ask if they know who Alex Bennett is.  Have you ever heard of this old man?  Okay.  Are you ready for your big announcement? 
[02:36:00]  Something like that.  If you mess up a little bit, that's fine.  Yes.  Okay.  Attention, ladies and gentlemen.  My name is Sam from the Opie and Anthony Show.  I just wanted to let you all know that so far we have two offices with four TVs and one  studio with eight TVs.  That makes a total of 12 TVs so far.  And Alex Bennett has none, if any of you know who that is. 
[02:36:30]  You guys can all get back to work.  I'll come over and meet you later if you'd like.  What was the reaction, Sam?  Well, a lot of people were on their phones, so they put the old finger in the other ear.  Yeah.  Who was the guy that yelled, you suck, or something like that?  I think that might have been Rob Cross from his office.  If you want to ask permission if we could do that wall of sound thing, we could ask Rob  Cross.  No, Steve is supposed to ask the main guy.  Oh, Steve, you're back with an answer? 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  All right, here's the bit for tomorrow.  We want to set up a wall of sound outside the studio and broadcast our famous Drill Doe  bit to the entire floor.  Steve went down to Blatter's office, one of the guys in charge, and you got the response.  The response was, no.  Then the response to the follow-up question was, well, why not?  No talk show audio in common areas or hallways.  Oh, must be policy.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  What about, isn't Sam kind of doing exactly that right now? 
[02:37:30]  No, through the headphones, but isn't there a monitor right outside the studio?  That was turned off a couple hours ago.  They only did it for the first hour of the show for technical reasons.  Wait, we're not allowed to broadcast that show in our little area outside the studio?  Nope.  This way, because this way they're just cutting off, this way some fucking douchebag can't  run into human resources.  I was just fangy.  You have to work in Miami.  I was just walking past. 
[02:38:00]  I had to go.  I didn't want to go past, and I heard the word vagina.  App.  So I want a picture of Alex Brown's studio.  Yeah, we're working on it, Jimmy.  It's difficult because of the glare.  Yeah, we're working on it.  Off his head?  No, they've got double glass.  Yeah, it's double glass everywhere.  So you get, you try to take pictures.  Well, just, I want to get a, just get a, you know, there's got to be a way to get a shot.  Let's ask if Enrique Inglés is coming up.  That was just a young go-getter.  I kind of like it better with the monitors off, because then you can really give them  a trash. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, they can make fun of people.  As they walk by.  From the cowardice of our own closed door.  It's the worst of 2009.  Wow, we got bad timing.  Yeah.  We almost had a moment.  The guy that we were just, uh, trashing just walked by the studio literally a minute before  he came on the air.  Is that who that was?  I thought it was B.  Arthur.  What a set of man tits.  Wow, yeah.  Oh, he's, he is in shape.  He's not happy.  No.  Sam goes, he gave us a look as he walked by. 
[02:39:00]  I know, I had my feet up on the console and I was commenting on, get out of the way,  I can't see the fifth television with the door open.  Yeah, he wasn't too happy.  Fucking beat it, jiggly tits.  Take your fucking hefty bosoms and get back into your studio.  He's wearing a PSP shirt.  I wonder what games he plays.  I'm trying to think of a good one.  I'm trying to think of one that tries in with old people.  I just can't.  Yes, prostates, things like that.  Grand theft, wheelchair.  Okay, that's a good one.  He's from San Francisco. 
[02:39:30]  I think he used to broadcast there.  Another one of my favorites.  That's Bernie Ward, another very liberal talk show host from San Francisco.  Had a bit of trouble.  Well, we're also finding out that Alex Bennett said a while ago, thanks to somebody,  thanks to somebody, we have spies in this facility,  that he's claiming that we ripped them off because we had a live studio audience.  Yes, that he started that.  He used to have a live studio audience, I guess, on Fridays or something in San Francisco.  Where, in ancient Greece? 
[02:40:00]  That's when they started doing live audiences.  He knows a lot of...  Fucking cunt.  So he knows a lot about us, and he was bitching that we stole his live audience.  The live audiences.  That's sort of how radio started.  Yeah, well, it was.  It was a live audience.  It was people in front of microphones doing stupid drama and things like that.  Absolutely.  Before he was around, it was comedians just stood in a room and talked to no one. 
[02:40:30]  It was such a bad reaction.  The audience.  We should invite him to watch some of our TVs from outside the class.  Yeah.  See if he wants to come in and talk to more than 50 people at a time.  I'm coughing.  But he walked right by.  Why wouldn't you come in?  You know, you're bitching about us.  You know who we are.  We were all very mature.  We were just going, ah-ha, ah-ha-ha-ha.  He wasn't going to be bullied into walking around the other way.  We got your studio.  He walked right past us. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Everybody took a stroll past his studio, too, to see what that was all about.  He's on from noon to three on America Left, right?  Or Sirius Left, is it called?  Yeah.  I don't even know.  So if our listeners want to check him out, from 9 to noon.  He's on right now.  9 to noon, I'm sorry.  If you're hearing us live.  See, look at that nice cross promotion.  Oh, here comes Crooked Hips.  Oh, God.  Look at the way he walks.  Wow.  Wow.  When you see it this way, it's even more amazing.  I want to play Isn't She Lovely as he approaches. 
[02:41:30]  He has Crooked Hips.  And our response was to openly laugh and mock him.  God, did he have big tits.  Oh, my God.  Shit.  I wonder if he's cranky.  Big, luscious tits.  Nice.  Big.  Buxonic beauty.  Alex Bennett.  Let's talk to the beautiful Alex Bennett.  This Buxonic.  That's right.  This geriatric Buxonic.  Has liver spots where hair used to be.  Rub your big dicks against his bald head. 
[02:42:00]  And then mash in between those juicy teats.  Those juicy, milk-giving udders.  Alex Bennett.  San Francisco's own.  Big, fat, B. Arthur tits.  And a shitty sweatshirt.  Two saggy tits where they count.  That's right.  He looks like Peter Boyle. 
[02:42:30]  It's Alex Bennett.  What a prick.  A 70-year-old man's ball bag hanging down to his kneecaps.  Alex Bennett.  He did Adrian Cronauer's job in World War I.  Alex Bennett.  Let's say hi to Kent, the movie guy. 
[02:43:00]  Kent.  Hey, guys.  I seem to remember a really old episode of, well, obviously it's old, of the Little Rascals.  Where all the kids start a band and go on the radio.  And there was a frickin' live audience in that.  So Little Rascals did the live audience bit.  So how is this guy the originator?  I don't know.  The International Silver Strength Submarine Band.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  All right, Kent. 
[02:43:30]  I got nothing else.  A buck sonic.  Right when he...  It's so great how fucking vicious people are.  Because the second he was pointed out, it's like, oh, that's him.  He's down the hall.  And he was pretty far.  And then as he's walking by, Jimmy just goes, look at the man tits on him.  Hey.  You could see him from the entire hallway's length away.  That's why he's fucking...  That's why he's cranky.  He's going through menopause.  And he's like, I'm a man.  This shouldn't be happening.  How are my ovaries drying up?  I'm a man. 
[02:44:00]  Withered, dried up, ovaries.  Odd for a male.  The buck sonic.  Here comes crooked hips again.  How many times are you going to take this walk down the hall?  Exactly.  What is he doing?  What are you doing?  There it is.  He doesn't even know.  He's switching.  He really is.  He's got the crooked hips.  He walks by that fucking out cue channel. 
[02:44:30]  There's going to be fucking two loads on the window before he gets past it.  I think you're going to hear a much different show tomorrow, by the way.  This swiveled hit buck sonic.  Well, let's go piss off more people.  Sam!  Of course.  Yeah.  You're just waiting there, huh?  Yeah, I'm just hanging out in the hallway, looking around, getting the lay of the land.  A lot more people have arrived to work?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people are here now.  The desks are filling up.  Any suits with designer glasses yet?  I suppose.  Well, I haven't gone into that wing yet, but I have seen at least three walk in. 
[02:45:00]  Okay.  With designer glasses.  I've been, I could, I guess, walk over towards the suits, but I don't know if I should.  Well, it's up to you, man.  Well, I mean, we could talk to some people just doing their work here.  Okay.  Your everyday schmoes.  Get the buzz on us and, you know, the big opener, too, of course.  We haven't done that in a while.  Okay, sure.  Excuse me.  Would either of you two like to talk to me on the air?  Sure.  I'm Sam from the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:45:30]  Hi, Sam.  So far, we have two offices and 12 TVs.  What do you have?  Uh, no office and negative TVs, so I think you guys are doing better than me.  Cool.  What's your name?  Alex.  What do you do here at SiriusXM?  I work on Hits One.  Oh, cool.  What kind of music are you playing today?  You know, a little pink, a little Kelly Clarkson, your normal top 40.  Maybe throw a little All-American Rejects in there for feeling frisky.  Nice.  What was, have you heard anything?  The Opie and Anthony Show is officially live here at SiriusXM. 
[02:46:00]  What's the vibe been leading up to this big, this huge thing?  It's been kind of interesting.  Everybody's been watching the studio be built, the offices, so it's kind of like,  you're waiting for everything to come and happen.  Now that it started, it kind of just doesn't really seem any different.  You expected everything to be a little bit crazier, but it kind of just fits right in.  Is there usually some idiot walking around with a microphone and harassing people at their desks?  Yes, but usually it's not the 80s game show mic.  Usually it's more of the M-Audio style mic, so at least you're bringing something different. 
[02:46:30]  This is a windscreen.  That sounds fabulous.  Hey, Sam, ask if they had the impression that, like, you know, kind of like the shitheads from across the street at XM were coming.  Did you kind of get the impression, like, the way people talk around the office, that a bunch of shitheads from XM were coming over here?  That's exactly the quote that I got.  How did you know?  Did somebody leak it?  Yeah, I guess that's the vibe we've been getting so far.  Well, thank you for your time.  Anytime, man. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  That was pretty good.  Wow, Sam, that was very gentlemanly.  Yeah.  Magic Johnson's only guy with AIDS was getting fatter.  How the fuck did he pull that off?  He's a giant.  He's a monster.  He just has that head.  Let's see.  There's some more females we could talk to.  It's always good to have a female voice.  Yes.  Excuse me, would any of you, either of you two young ladies like to talk to me on the air?  I'm Sam with the Opie and Anthony Show.  So far, we have two offices and 12 TVs.  What do you have?  An intern desk. 
[02:47:30]  What's your name?  Christina.  Christina, what do you do here at Sirius XM?  I'm an intern for the music programming department.  That sounds exciting.  What kind of things do they have you guys doing?  Loading voice tracks and music.  Jesus, don't say that too loud.  Do you feel like you're learning something as an intern?  Our interns get us coffee.  Yeah, you see how radio production works, the background work.  Is that what interns are supposed to learn?  Here at the Opie and Anthony Show, the interns just follow me around with cords in their hand. 
[02:48:00]  So, how long have you been at Sirius XM?  Since February.  Ask her if she wants to be an on-air personality eventually.  Would you eventually like to be an on-air personality on the radio?  Definitely.  Tell her to work on it.  You should probably, I mean, the little thing, you should work on it a little bit.  You think I should work on it?  Just personality-wise.  Oh, really?  What did you want to say?  That you're boring.  That you're boring.  Okay.  Thank you, and I hope you take my constructive criticism with a smile. 
[02:48:30]  Okay, thanks.  Look at Sam.  What an asshole, you dick.  You want to do one more, Sam?  Yes, of course I do.  Okay.  Would you like another young lady or a young man?  Sure, whoever.  Okay.  Whoever I think is going to work.  We'll talk to this young lady here.  Excuse me, miss.  Would you like to talk to Opie and Anthony on the air?  Of course.  My name's Sam.  I work for Opie and Anthony.  So far, we have two offices and 12 TVs. 
[02:49:00]  What do you have?  Um, one monitor and the XM and a serious radio.  We actually, a lot of our XMs got lost in the move from studio to studio.  So we actually may have to take that XM unless you have some serious reason for keeping it.  You're going to have to fight me to take my XM radio.  You got like 200 TVs over there.  You're not going to take my one little radio from me. 
[02:49:30]  So what do you do here?  I am a coordinator for the 70s, the 80s, and The Message.  What's The Message?  It's a Christian pop rock channel.  That's it.  I need to laugh.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  Hey, Sam, let's cause a commotion.  Okay.  Like, just out of nowhere, start yelling, is there an engineer in the house?  One of the 12 flat-screen TVs has gone down.  We can't get a picture.  No, it's a bit fuzzy.  It's a bit fuzzy.  And the talent doesn't like to strain their eyes. 
[02:50:00]  Okay, thank you very much.  Just start a commotion.  Holy shit.  Hold on.  Me, I'm walking down the hall.  Wait a minute.  Here comes Crooked Eps again.  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  There's a third lap.  Crooked Eps to stop walking down the hall.  What is he doing?  How is that music playing?  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  He's giving hot arms all over the facility.  Please don't tell him.  Why does he keep walking down the long hall with those Crooked Eps? 
[02:50:30]  I don't know.  You would think he would rest them.  Holy shit, the vulture from Spider-Man is coming.  What is that fucking creep?  All right, Sam.  Sam.  Okay.  Cause a commotion, right?  Right now.  Opie, Anthony, I've arrived at our office and we need an engineer.  One of our 12 flat screen TVs is fuzzy.  Is there an engineer in the house that could help us with our fuzzy flat screen TV?  So the talent doesn't have to strain their eyes.  One twelfth of our TVs is fuzzy and the talent may have to strain their eyes. 
[02:51:00]  A hush has fallen over SiriusXM.  I am making eye contact.  One twelfth of our TVs.  That's less than, wait, that's less than 10%, isn't it?  Yes, it is.  You know what?  8%.  You know how, you do realize that we are looked at as such douches for needing so many TVs. 
[02:51:30]  Why do we need so many televisions?  We were looked at as douches just for being there and attacking Sirius.  Oh, I know.  But now there's a reason.  Yeah.  Like, everyone seems to know that we have this many TVs and can't understand why we need them.  All right, let's be honest with each other, too.  There's eight TVs in the studio.  How many total minutes have you looked at the TVs this morning?  Not long.  I would say maybe two minutes.  I'm looking at somebody on fire on one of the channels and then tires on another one. 
[02:52:00]  All stuff we need for our broadcast.  I mean, to tell you the truth, I could just glance over at other televisions, but this  is more comfortable.  Sure.  Like Jimmy said before, I don't have to crick my neck.  I have to crick my neck to see one of them, and I smell lawsuit.  I smell lawsuit.  I'm permanently injured.  All right.  Peter, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Yeah, I just called that Alex Bennett show. 
[02:52:30]  I said I wanted to talk about health care, and they put me right on, and he goes, Peter,  what do you need?  I said, listen, Alex, I hear you got a big pair of bologna tits in a small studio.  Is that true?  Did he answer?  He goes, what?  I go, yeah, big bologna tits in a small studio.  Is that true?  He goes, I thought you wanted to talk about health care.  What kind of show is this where an asshole like that gets through?  That's it.  I quit.  I'm done. 
[02:53:00]  I'm done.  I quit.  It was hilarious.  He really said that.  Yeah.  Word to God.  Awesome.  Thank you, Peter.  Very funny.  By the way, when we leave today, John Long Island has a great idea.  Every single TV has to be on the same channel.  Yes.  Every single one.  And some real lame-ass channel.  There's something really bad.  Somebody before suggested that we put the TV guy channel on.  Yeah.  Just put that on.  Yeah.  Fucking Stinky is hanging out for the last hour in studio. 
[02:53:30]  Remember the Stinkster?  From the NEW days.  Yes.  Young Garrett.  Garrett, how long have you been working here?  Awesome Garrett.  Five years.  Five years.  Five years.  Awesome Garrett has been here.  How old are you these days, Garrett?  I need you to go ahead.  You're giving me numbers?  Hold on, Garrett.  Go ahead.  31.  Wow!  What?  Remember when he was a little kid?  He was an intern.  Aww.  Who were the girls that worked for us?  It was Marion. 
[02:54:00]  Who was the other girl I was thinking of recently?  Remember the intern?  Yeah, Rachel.  Rachel?  Whatever happened to her?  Rachel.  She moved up to Boston.  She's 57 now, I hear.  I remember.  She's pretty, man.  We saw Rachel when we used to go to BCN every once in a while.  I think she works in insurance or something.  At last I heard.  I don't know.  And then we see Francine every so often.  Oh, yeah?  She used to live by me, and she tried to give me her cell phone number and stuff.  I didn't want to deal with it.  Let me give you my cell phone number.  I saw her on the street holding my cell phone, and then later she's like, oh, let me give you 
[02:54:30]  my number.  I'm like, oh, I don't have my phone.  And she totally knew us.  But I couldn't deal with her.  You racist.  So annoying.  I love you.  You like Francine.  Oh, God.  She still annoys us, man.  Don't you want to fuck her?  I don't know.  Maybe.  She seems so dumb, though.  Oh, my God.  That would be a real dumb fuck.  So after you come, don't do calculus.  Fucking stinky.  Doing all right. 
[02:55:00]  So you've been here five years, and you're living in the city?  Astoria.  Oh, yeah.  Who are you working for now?  Like, what show?  Jay Thomas, three to six.  That's right.  I've said that before.  I had to do a phone run to Jay Thomas.  That's when I talked to Stinky.  I was promoting my book, and I was on my way up to do a signing in Rhode Island, and I  was in the fucking bathroom of an Amtrak on the phone.  Jay was cool about it, but I was in the bathroom of an Amtrak.  Were you taking it down?  No, I was standing there fucking rocking around, and I came out.  I'm talking loud, and I came out.  There was people that realized I was just on the phone in the bathroom because I was 
[02:55:30]  sitting there waiting outside.  It's like, I'm doing an interview.  I'm an author.  Yeah.  There's an old man with a nice brown streak down his leg.  That's what you get.  Yeah, Jay's a legend, man.  Yeah, he's awesome to work with.  Jay's, uh...  You know, I've never had a problem with Jay Thomas.  I think he did our show a couple times.  Yeah, didn't he call up, and we were, like...  We were fucking around a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, we had to go on him and stuff.  That was cool, though.  Who's this guy?  Who are you, bro?  Just taking a look?  Oh, Garrett knows him. 
[02:56:00]  Who's that?  Raphael.  What does Raphael do?  He's...  I think he owns the building or something, pretty much.  He owns the building.  For real?  What?  Yes.  I can't hear him.  Come in.  Oh, he didn't want to come in here.  A lot of people taking a look at our eight TVs in this location.  Were people...  Ask Raphael if people were talking about us coming here.  Were people talking about O&A coming here?  Yeah, come on.  Now he comes in.  We don't bite.  Yeah.  Wait, you know Mars, too? 
[02:56:30]  Yes, I know Mars.  Yeah, he's a great help, yeah?  Yeah, cool.  All right, so you guys got me walking me through it.  Who's who here?  Oh, my God.  Hey, listen.  I'm Opie.  That's Anthony, and that's Jim Norton.  So now just switch those all around.  Hey, listen.  All around.  Hey, listen.  Why can I say I'm a sport fan, okay?  Who would look like to have the name Anthony?  Let's start with that.  And you got me there, man.  You got me there.  So, I mean, I completely have pictures of you guys. 
[02:57:00]  All right, let's start with Opie.  Who would look like Opie?  Who looks like Opie?  Trust me, guys.  Clearly, clearly, guys, picture you different.  We couldn't have more obvious names.  No, no, no.  We sound a lot taller on the radio.  Listen, listen, listen.  No offense.  I was expecting a couple, you know, more heavy-setted guys.  More, you know, I would say, you know, here and there.  A lot of fat guys in radio.  Fat guys with tits.  Hey, listen.  A couple ponytails, you know.  Hey, you know.  Yeah.  Where's the stripper pole?  That's what I came actually to look for.  Yeah, well, it doesn't quite fit in here. 
[02:57:30]  I can make it work, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Hey, buddy.  Oh, ceilings a little long.  Who do you, do you, do you work for the building or one channel?  No, I work for the facility, planning and construction.  We work with the broadcast engineering on, you know, the whole design and bring you guys  over.  So you had something to do with this whole.  Absolutely, and I'm very proud of that.  Could they, could they make, we're trying to get the console to be a little bit bigger  because there's not enough room.  We want to store our winter coats on the middle of the table. 
[02:58:00]  Well, well, yeah, yeah.  I can tell you that I had nothing to do on that part, but I guess, I hear there's something  about a barbecue grill they want to put you in front.  If they could do that, I wouldn't even feel the heat.  It's freaking, you could say freaking rain already, right?  Oh, you can curse here.  What was the buzz with us coming over here?  What was that?  And be honest, were people like, ugh, those guys.  Well, I mean, ironically, check this out.  On Saturday, my morning run, I'm wearing a raincoat that has a bit serious on, you know, 
[02:58:30]  doing no advertising, but what the hell, it's a free stuff, you know.  So I'm running, and not likely, guys, maybe 10, 12 people stab me and say, hey, you work  for Sirius, you know, what's going on?  I'm like, you know, I mean, in this area, I mean, what's going on with the economy, you  know, I mean, I don't feel confident saying, hey, I work for Sirius.  I would just, I would tell you, man, I'm just glad that I have a job, you know what I  mean?  That's how everybody feels about now.  But you guys just brought the whole thing, you know, to a different level, because, you 
[02:59:00]  know, people just keep stabbing me and say, hey, you know, Opie and Anthony, yo, Howard,  what's going on?  You know, we're on and fast, you know, we got water and oil in one container, what's  going to happen?  You know, so, you know, it made me curious to stop by and see who are the big Opie and  Anthony, you know?  Ah, yeah.  So here I am.  I would too.  And by the way, they did force me to say that on the radio.  Yeah, I hear you.  I'm sure, I'm sure.  All right.  So how's everything, guys?  I see you have a pink slip.  Who gets the pink slip? 
[02:59:30]  No, that's not good to carry around this place.  You don't want to be carrying anything with the color pink.  No, this is confirmation for the contractors, for the work that they did, you know, for me  to sign.  They're building a breast rest for Alex.  A place for his bosoms to sit.  Oh, he just doesn't want to be on mic anymore.  I've got to start charging for this.  No, I'm kidding.  But guys, guys, I just, you know, anything you guys need, team, anything you guys need,  anything that you think that my team can provide you with, feel free, you know, to ask. 
[03:00:00]  Very good.  To make your living easier.  And, I mean, rock on, baby.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Meeting another.  Take it easy, sir.  Another member of the team.  They're telling us.  Stinky, people want to know, people want to know if Club Stinky is still around.  Who's that?  Coming in like, uh, Stinky is a big, huge pothead.  I don't know if he's told you that over the last five years.  All right, good.  Oh. 
[03:00:30]  He's just back.  Oh, no, we cannot.  What?  You smoke a little dog?  Oh, no.  Couldn't talk about that on the air.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You ever hear of Club Stinky?  We used to have a soccer team, and we didn't even lose it.  We used to celebrate.  Sorry.  Okay.  Ah, there you go.  Just leave it like that.  Soccer team, where'd they play on the console?  That's a console.  See you, man.  I see you.  Okay, good.  All right.  Thank you.  Rafael. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, he's looking.  Oh, God.  He's just, oh, you see that motorcycle guy?  Yeah.  That's why we have eight TVs in here.  They look like Evan.  Watch him wobble.  Why the fuck is Evan?  How hard?  He's going like 100 miles an hour, and it's just wobbling.  And you know he's got to be hitting the brakes.  It's Michael J. Fox riding to work.  Oh, shit.  That guy really dumped that bike.  Oh, oh.  Oh, he's fine. 
[03:01:30]  Who's this fucking, who's the guy who's like sitting next to  Maury giving him all this tape?  There's this buck-toothed creep.  He really looks like an ass.  Whew.  So.  Let's see, hence the TVs.  Yeah, I think we did enough for today.  Enough damage?  I think we tried out the new studio, and so far, so good, man.  It's 1040, Jesus.  A couple adjustments, but we're, uh...  Oh, boy.  Somebody's been updating Alex Bennett's Wikipedia page.  Oh, no.  Helpful updates?  Reports are coming in.  Oh, no.  What was the update? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, do you have one?  I didn't, uh, no.  Yeah.  I didn't check.  Wait, we can take a look at it.  Yeah, I'm going through it right now.  Oh, I see.  Are there updates?  Yeah, let's see.  Bennett was born in San Francisco, blah, blah, blah.  He adopted his on-air name as a tribute to his late father.  He is believed to be a closet homosexual.  Wait.  Oh, wow.  Is that on Wikipedia?  Yeah, it's on the Wikipedia.  All right, listen.  Wow.  Let's make it perfectly clear that, uh, we have no idea.  I don't know.  Oh, who's reading on Wikipedia? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  I know.  Let's just make sure people know that.  Oh, here's some trivia about Alex Bennett.  Um, let's see.  Bennett was the first American DJ to play the song No Matter What.  And on April 14th, 2009, it was revealed that Bennett's office at SiriusXM has no flat  screen TVs, while Opie and Anthony have at least 12.  Oh, that's worthy of Wikipedia.  That's on his Wikipedia page, huh?  Why would that be there?  That's silly.  As long as they don't say anything degrading.  It's like, that guy calling in about his baloney tits.  I mean, sure, it was funny, but it's like, it's like that type of thing you want to see 
[03:03:00]  in print.  I mean, we laughed.  No, no, no, never.  It was more of a visual.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  He's on from what?  Nine to 12 here on the East Coast?  Yeah, yeah.  He's on right now.  Give him a plus.  Sirius left.  Yeah.  Say, look, maybe he's a good show.  Give him a listen.  Maybe you like him.  Maybe you want to discuss a topic with him.  Seriously, of course.  Fine.  Fair enough.  That's great.  You got to put that info about how many flat screens.  I just know we are the assholes of this building. 
[03:03:30]  And one reason is that we have so many flat screen TVs.  Already.  And it's just looking in here going, why?  I got to go.  I got to go down memory lane for our buddy Garrett.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  I stole that one.  I still use it today.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  Hoo-hoo, ripping us off.  Well, Garrett, it was good seeing you, buddy.  You too, guys.  Yes.  I think we're about done for today.  Garrett's 31.  He was fucking like 18.  Jesus.  How old were you really when you started with us? 
[03:04:00]  20?  Nine, 10 years ago.  So 21, 22.  He was a little tater tot.  Fuck.  Wow.  Married kids.  What do you got?  I'm almost Opie's age now.  Wow.  Yeah.  See?  Wait, you're 31, so oh my God.  We were like almost your age.  We were just a couple years older at the time.  Sure.  A couple or a few.  A couple.  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  Nice to see no one's matured mentally.  That's part of this fucking business.  I definitely have it.  No.  Thank God for that.  We at the Opie and Anthony Show would like to thank the staff of Sirius XM Satellite Radio  for welcoming us with open arms and open hearts.  Hello, sir.  What's your name?  I got to do a show.  I got to go.  Oh, he's got to.  He's shutting the door.  Hello, miss.  What's your name?  I'm late.  That's a strange name.  We know it wasn't easy for you guys to give up so much studio space, but where else were 
[03:05:00]  we going to put all of our 12 flat screen TVs?  Two offices with four TVs and one studio with eight TVs, and Alex Bennett has none, if any  of you know who that is.  We just know that this new arrangement is going to inspire creativity and peaceful harmony  for years to come.  Excuse me, sirs.  What's your name?  He said he was going to shoot me, and then he walked into the studio.  We're the Opie and Anthony Show, and we're all about making friends.  What's the word about Opie and Anthony? 
[03:05:30]  Is it not good?  Yeah, it's not good.  Yeah, I guess that's the vibe we've been getting so far.  You're listening to the worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  Hey, it's Primetime Sam Roberts, and the Opie and Anthony Show is taking some time off for  the holidays, but just because the show isn't on doesn't mean your favorite radio disc  jockeys aren't up to something.  Follow them on Twitter and keep up with their hijinks all vacation long.  Follow Opie at Opie Radio, Anthony at Anthony Cumia, and Jim at Jim Norton on Twitter. 
[03:06:00]  Enjoy your holiday.  We'll be back in the new year.  My Twitter is NotSam, N-O-T-S-A.  All right, I'm going, I'm going, M.  It's Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2009.  Hosted by Sam and E-Rock.  Eee!  Whoop.  Eee.  On The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:06:30]  I'm E-Rock, he's saying...  The year wouldn't be complete without taking a look back at the worst of Ted.  Who is that?  It's Professor Ted from...  Ted, Ted, Ted Burns.  Teddy Rash.  Ted Portnork.  Ted's Match Emporium.  Ted's Inflatable Rat Factory.  Ted's Egg Emporium.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  Ted's an ass.  Let's say hi to Rich in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  I found some Back to the Future memorabilia on Ted's movie memorabilia website. 
[03:07:00]  That is exactly a very good site.  I sell all the rare items.  What do you have, Ted, from Back to the Future?  Because I'd really like to...  I have a shoelace that was in Christopher Lloyd's shoe when he arrived on set.  I have a cup that had coffee in it, so Michael G. Fox spilled it.  I have things for every movie.  Oh, what other movies?  I don't know.  You name a movie, I'll tell you what I got.  All right. 
[03:07:30]  What do you have from, like, Star Wars, maybe, or something?  I have some dirt that Darth Vader stepped in.  Oh, so it's a footprint of Darth Vader?  No, it's just the footprint wasn't preserved.  Oh.  It's some dirt that was under the boot of James Earl Jones.  Oh, I thought it was maybe a plaster castle footprint, which would kind of be cool.  No, it was originally tracked onto the carpet by Lando Calorissian.  But James Earl Jones wasn't actually in the Vader suit.  That's why it's so rare, Daniel. 
[03:08:00]  It was actually that big guy from...  Yes, David Prowse.  Clockwork Orange.  But one day, James Earl Jones showed up, and David said,  Get that Jiggaboo out of my suit.  I don't think he said that.  It was very inappropriate.  Very inappropriate, nasty, and rude.  Yes, I didn't care for that type of talk.  Yes, you can't have that kind of talk about such a fantastic actor.  I couldn't agree more, Anthony.  Yes, Gregory.  Do you have anything from the Godfather series?  I certainly do.  I have three of Marlon Brando's mustache hairs.  Mustache hairs. 
[03:08:30]  They fell out by the car when he was shot, when Fredo fumbled with the weapon.  I also had some gravel that was on the ground that got caught in his pant leg when he fell.  How could you get that but not get something better?  If you were that close to get mustache hairs and gravel,  couldn't you have gotten maybe the prop gun that Fredo had?  I had that, but I traded it for the mustache hairs and a piece of lemon pie.  I have very rare movie items. 
[03:09:00]  Do you have anything from The Shining?  I bet Ant would love something from The Shining.  I certainly do.  I have red gelatin that was used to come out the side of the door, I believe.  Or maybe it was on the children's head.  I have a swatch of carpeting.  That was in room 501, which wasn't featured in the movie.  There is no 501, isn't there?  I thought, yes.  Sometimes reports will be false. 
[03:09:30]  I don't understand why you would have something like that  and not get something from The Shining, like one of the knives.  I had the axe that he was chasing the boy with,  but I traded it for hedge seeds.  Why would you want hedge seeds?  So I could make my own maze in my living room and run through it for hours.  But you had the axe.  That's like a key prop from the movie.  That is the thing to have.  Yes, I had that, but I would refuse entry on seven straight planes. 
[03:10:00]  I would carry my axe and go here.  I'm checking this.  I wish I had a Scatman Crothers-related piece.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  Yes, that painting.  I used to have that, but I traded it for the comforter he was laying on.  I have that, the comforter.  And I have three of his giant black toenail clippings.  I use them as visors when I play cards.  Well, that's very unique memorabilia. 
[03:10:30]  Yes, it is.  I don't see that on eBay or anything like that.  Oh, it's very, very, very hard to get things.  Yes, yes.  A lot of stuff's easy.  Yeah, anyone can.  Who's getting those toenails?  They certainly can.  That movie is very frightening.  Yes, I was frightened watching it.  I also have the Continental Airlines seat that he sat in.  Oh, you do?  Yes, I do.  I sit in my living room when I watch television.  That actually sounds like a pretty good prop.  Yes, it is.  It's not the original, though. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  It's actually the chair they used in rehearsal.  It's just a plastic chair.  But they said this is the one he pretended he was on the plane.  So, but Scatman sat in it?  That's what I've been told.  I spent $4,000 on that.  I certainly hope so.  And I traded Jack Nicholson's jacket.  The jacket that he wore, the shining.  I traded that for the seat that Scatman sat on, allegedly.  That would have been something to have. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know.  You hear the organ that actually is playing this music?  Yeah, you have that?  No, I'm just enjoying the music with you.  They wanted me to.  Somebody tried to sell me this, but I didn't believe it was the actual organ.  Do you have anything speaking to Nicholson from Cuckoo's Nest?  That's a great question.  Yes, I do.  Oh.  What do you got?  What do you got from Cuckoo's Nest?  An indented pillow.  Is it the pillow that Chief used?  I've been told.  And I have broken glass from the window that Chief threw the giant sink through. 
[03:12:00]  And I have water from that sink.  I drink it on a daily basis.  Whatever happened to the sink?  A lot of water.  What's that?  Whatever happened to the sink?  I had that.  I traded for shards of glass.  Who needs a big, heavy sink, Gregory?  You seem to have given away a lot of good memorabilia for stuff that people really wouldn't care about.  I've had a bunch of bunk memorabilia, and I traded it for rare items.  Well, I can't wait to maybe come over and see your collection.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And I have the $25 that Mr. Hardy was going to bet. 
[03:12:30]  That he was going to bet.  Yup, and I have a pack of Mr. Cheswick cigarettes, and I have one of Louise Fletcher's vaginal lips.  How did you get that, Ted?  I was on my front porch.  Somebody thought it was a slug, and they threw salt on it.  Nice.  Where can we see the rest of this stuff, Ted?  I'm working on a website.  Yes. 
[03:13:00]  I'm trying to use my computer.  I have DOS prompt.  I'm C-prompting.  C-prompt?  Why don't you get an operating system like Windows or Mac?  Yes.  See, right now I'm trying to get Ted Sheckler's rare, yet not impossible, to get movie memorabilia.com.  But that's Cyber Squatters have it.  Sounds like something somebody wouldn't have, and it's very inconvenient.  They tried to hijack me for $7.  We're going to court in May.  That's a long name. 
[03:13:30]  It certainly is, Anthony.  It's hard to type in.  Yes.  Ted's memorabilia didn't sound right to me.  That would have been easy, though.  Exactly.  Who needs easy?  Ted, we're getting a question from James in Michigan.  Oh, welcome aboard, James.  Thanks for calling the program.  Do you have any...  You sound like Gregory.  Do you have any Pink Panther memorabilia?  Oh, yes, I do.  Yeah.  I actually have Peter Sellers spleen in a jar.  Really?  Yes, I do.  I bet you Steve Martin's jealous that you have that. 
[03:14:00]  Yes, he is.  He sometimes...  He wears it as a hat, and we all make little jokes.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I have a toilet, which is where that piece of shit should have been playing for.  All right, there you go.  Ted's...  What's the website again?  Ted's...  Ted's Sheckler's rare, yet not impossible to get moviememorabilia.com.  Oh, my God.  I just had a brain aneurysm.  That's impossible.  I had a brain aneurysm. 
[03:14:30]  Try to remember that.  That wouldn't even fit on the top of the webpage.  That's right.  Yeah.  Ted, everyone.  I fucking love Ted, man.  Love Ted.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  I'm Ted the Whale Watcher.  I'm Ted Hitler.  I'm Ted Hitler Jones.  The Ted the Jones part of the good part.  Dear Corinthians.  I'm Corinthians Ted again.  I'm Ted the Mad Push-Asser.  I'm Ted.  Dr. Ted Kocko in studio today.  Did you understand?  That's the big thing. 
[03:15:00]  How wild that would be.  I heard your ears.  I'm Ted the Rich Boss.  I'm Ted the Rabbit Tooth Cube.  I'm Ted...  Don't let me think.  I'm Ted, and I don't know what I'm doing.  It's the worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show's worst of 2009 with Sam and E-Rock.  Looking back at the past year on the show. 
[03:15:30]  You know, Sam, when I look back over the lists of worst of, there's a certain topic that seems  to pop up rather often.  E-Rock.  Well, yes.  I am famous.  But it usually involves Anthony and a girlfriend.  Well, yes.  Anthony has had his issues.  He broke up with a long-term girlfriend a couple of years ago, and since then has been enjoying  single life.  And with that has come a sort of rotation of different women that he's seen. 
[03:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  This one, and I'm quoting him directly from what he said on air, was the creepiest moment  of his life.  Yes.  We...  I don't even...  Let's not even give away the spoiler of exactly what happened, but this was the moment  that Anthony finally felt like a creep.  I can't believe he brought it to the air, but I'm so glad he did.  It's number 15 on the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  Hello, I'm Katie.  I'm Jules.  We're the Tintings.  And we love Anthony for blasting our CD for all the little kids at his pool parties and 
[03:16:30]  sleepovers.  Yeah, I had a very interesting...  Yes, Anthony.  Actually, interesting few days.  I haven't got much sleep or anything.  There's like, you know, a girl over the house, you know.  You know how that goes, right?  When you're a single, successful guy, like me working at the burger place.  You know, so, girl over the house. 
[03:17:00]  And apparently she has asthma.  She got asthma.  Oof.  Out of nowhere.  I'll give you asthma.  You get dressed, you're playing golf today.  Are you dating...  What about my asthma?  I'll give you asthma.  Are you dating preemies at this point?  No.  Their lungs aren't fully developed?  No.  That's not...  No.  No.  Do you have an incubator in your fucking compound?  No.  I don't have an incubator. 
[03:17:30]  Probably not asthma.  It's probably just gasping at your political ideologies.  Well, that's true.  They just go...  No, no.  You're dating so young, their lungs aren't fully developed.  No, it's not like that.  Sorry.  It's just...  It's asthma.  It's asthma.  I'll give you asthma.  I'll give you asthma.  And it's just gotten kind of worse over the past couple of days.  Well, that's not good.  So, you know, she hasn't been able to go back home. 
[03:18:00]  You know, she lives out of state.  She hasn't been able to go back home.  Thailand?  No, not Thailand.  So, last night, it was time to...  I haven't gotten any sleep, by the way.  I'm exhausted.  I'm tripping over myself.  Had to take her to the emergency room.  My favorite place to go.  What time?  To take her.  This was about... 
[03:18:30]  1.30 in the morning.  Were you asleep?  No.  No, I was still awake because, you know, the...  The Yankees won and stuff like that.  Things, you know.  It's just one of those things.  So, it was time to, you know, go to the emergency room.  How far do you live from the hospital?  It's not far.  It's a few exits.  Not bad.  So, we go there and, you know, you'd go through all that paperwork stuff that, you know, she's  going through all the paperwork and everything like that.  It takes forever.  And then... 
[03:19:00]  Is she going through the...  Because this fucking frustrates the shit out of me.  Yeah.  Is she filling out her paperwork as she's gasping for air?  Well, she's not gasping for air, but...  Because the emergency room is wonderful when it comes to that.  Make sure the paperwork is done before we even acknowledge that you're dying right in  front of our eyes.  I know.  It really is horrible.  When I had the worst allergy attack of my life where I really thought I was, like, minutes  from dying...  Yeah.  They had to make sure I had all my fucking paperwork.  I had a pounding headache.  My headache was so bad.  Sorry, Anthony.  But it drives me fucking nuts.  I couldn't even see the form anymore. 
[03:19:30]  That's how bad I was.  And I'm like, will you just take care of this and then we'll worry about the stupid paperwork.  Oh, they want to know your fucking...  But they need the paperwork immediately.  They want to know they're getting paid, motherfucker.  Sorry.  It's one of my fucking pet peeves in this world.  The stupid emergency room and their dumb paperwork first.  Filling out the paperwork.  I'm sorry.  Shut up.  So, no, no, they're filling out the paperwork.  And then it's time to, you know, go into the emergency room portion of the hospital. 
[03:20:00]  Now, I've, you know, dealt with that before in the past.  But this was a little embarrassing.  They took her into pediatrics.  Oh, my God.  Do you know there's a whole nother emergency room for pediatrics?  Oh, my God.  And they brought her in there.  And there's little paintings on the walls and paper, like ducks and stuff all over the place. 
[03:20:30]  I can't even look at you.  And there's little kids walking around, and a baby was crying, and she's in pediatrics.  And the doctor asked me, like, you know, oh, okay, who are you?  And I'm just like, a friend.  I'm a friend.  I was...  I've never felt like the creep that I know I am.  But I've never actually felt it. 
[03:21:00]  Who are you, a friend?  I'm a friend.  I'm a friend.  I've never even seen that part of a hospital.  And I'm sitting in this little chair.  Right.  And I'm looking at, like, a child's rights in the hospital.  And it says things like, please, tell me if it's going to hurt.  I'll be okay with it.  And please, give me a hug. 
[03:21:30]  I could use it.  Let me take my toy wherever I'm going in the hospital.  And I'm reading signs like this and looking at paper fucking mobiles of ducks and geese.  All right.  You know, you brought this to the show.  I know.  You just threw yourself under the bus.  It was so embarrassing.  Hurricane Virginia Tech.  Wow.  A pediatric and a geriatric.  Pediatric.  And I noticed there was, like, there was a cabinet with games in it. 
[03:22:00]  All kinds of games.  I'm in the fucking pediatric ward.  And, you know, the girl there, she's tall.  And her feet were hanging off at the end of the friggin' pediatric bed.  I felt so bad.  And I felt like such a ghoul.  Just because they're tall doesn't make it okay.  No, no.  I understand.  I understand.  Did you take advantage of the situation and get some speed dating in while they were running her through the tests? 
[03:22:30]  There was one girl that got up and she's holding the back of her gown shut and she had to be about 16 or 17 to go give a urine sample.  She was pretty cute, I must say.  But, you know, I put my head down the whole time.  I just felt like.  Were you ashamed and embarrassed?  Dude, I was completely ashamed.  You were a celebrity.  Yeah.  Finally, you were ashamed.  It finally took. 
[03:23:00]  It's not bad for you to have a little shame, finally.  To go to the emergency room.  Yeah.  And have a girl that's been, you know, staying at the house because she's sick and can't, you know, can't make it back home in that state with the asthma.  Did you just pay cash?  Pediatrics.  Did you just pay cash for the.  No, she's insured.  She's got insurance.  Did she have to call her God?  God, her insurance.  No, she's got insurance. 
[03:23:30]  But it's like.  What the fuck?  It's like pediatrics.  So then they they actually admit admitted her and.  They didn't put her in the regular room wing and now she's in the pediatrics part of the hospital.  So not only the emergency room is pediatrics, but she's in a pediatric room, which can only mean.  But when I do go there, she's probably sharing the room with some child, you know, some child with a broken leg. 
[03:24:00]  The first broken bone.  It's just it really is.  I've never felt so ghoulish in my life.  Well, let's start with this.  Tony in Iowa.  Very good question.  Did she get a sticker after her boo boo was gone?  Boo boo.  No, there wasn't a giraffe gurney, a giraffe hippopotamus monkey gurney.  Eric, once again, for Virginia Tech, kind of rework my line, but it's true.  Just because she doesn't have to be on her tippy toes doesn't make it OK. 
[03:24:30]  Did they give her a lollipop after she let?  No.  But oh, look, there's a castle gurney.  It's like you're in a castle, like you're a little princess in a castle.  Thank you, Danny, for popping up these embarrassing pictures.  And then some curmudgeon has to point out princesses don't have catheters.  Kevin from Connecticut.  And you were actually in the pedo-atric ward.  No. 
[03:25:00]  Look at that picture.  Danny's the worst.  It's a little kid in a hospital gown that's dragging on the floor.  You know they said that girl's father is creepy when they saw you.  No, because that's the worst.  That's another bad part, too, because they have to ask her all bunch of questions.  And I guess they asked her if she was sexually active.  And, you know, she had to say yes.  And then.  Why do they want to know that?  Somehow I got brought into the conversation.  Why do they want to know that? 
[03:25:30]  They always ask, you know, people in pediatrics that, you know.  And then I think they asked her if her parents knew.  Did you get some creepy looks?  Let's be honest.  Let's get right to it.  What were the looks you were getting?  Yeah, I think I really.  The doctor was giving me some really creepy looks.  And the nurses and stuff didn't even want to acknowledge I was there.  Why would they?  You're a filthy shock jock.  You fucking scum of the earth. 
[03:26:00]  You horrible child spoiler.  That's what I was.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I hope whoever.  Ah, fuck.  It's feedback.  Forget it.  Everybody wants in on this one.  Yeah.  I hope whoever was working the desk recognized Ant and put her in pediatrics just to fuck with Ant.  No, they put her right in there.  Wow.  Pediatric is nothing.  I've never been so mortified.  Were you embarrassed?  At being with a younger lady than when she had to be admitted to pediatrics. 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  Yes.  And I've been in some weird situations where, of course, there'd be, you know, you know,  hey, that must be, you know, your dad or something.  That's never good.  But I get a good laugh out of that.  Who cares?  But pediatrics.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  She is, you know, of age.  Definitely.  I was wondering the same thing.  Like, why admit somebody of that age?  I think because pediatrics includes the 18th year. 
[03:27:00]  Does it?  Yeah.  I remember when I was 18 and I was, when I went to the doctor, I still had to go to the  pediatrician at 18.  And I felt so, because like I'm sitting there and there's kids toys, you know, where they  play with those, those beads that go along the, the, uh, the track, the wire track.  And I'm sitting there like, why am I here?  Like I'm wearing a Metallica t-shirt and I'm like, come on.  Drunkenly playing with an abacus.  You're in pediatrics.  Scott from Quakertown.  So now you have to go pick her up from Child Protective Services today yet? 
[03:27:30]  No.  Do you have to sit with a Dyfus counselor with your chick?  Look, she's completely of age, an adult, but, uh, you know, for some reason they put her  in pediatrics.  Uh, let's go to Chris and PA.  Chris.  Hey, Ann, did you guys sit at the little Lego table and build your future dream house together?  She likes Legos.  Don't love Legos.  What am I going to do?  Wow.  You know. 
[03:28:00]  Well, are you, whoa.  Are you okay?  I just feel bad because, you know, she's in there and, you know.  Are you okay if I take that phone call?  I can't believe I'm using restraint.  I can't see what the thing in the way.  That would be burp.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  All right.  I got to show some restraint.  Four girls in the hospital.  Some, it was a burp joke.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  Thank you, Joe.  I don't want to make fun, but it's just, actually, I'm not making fun.  I'm not making fun of the fact that, you know, there's bad asthma, and she went into the hospital.  I'm making light of the fact that I am such a fucking god-awful creep, and to finally see it staring back at me in the mirror.  She's still in there?  She all right?  Yeah, she's still in there.  You know, they got to make sure, you know, they do tests and everything and see what kind of medication works better.  Because she's got, you know, the inhaler and stuff like that.  Right.  But, yeah, that's not doing the trick, so. 
[03:29:00]  Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Yeah, were you kind of worried that you might bump into one of your exes there?  In pediatrics?  Oh.  I mean, you're being a repeat offender and all, you know.  Oh, my God.  A repeat offender.  I never date underage girls.  Well.  Well.  I don't know.  Well.  Not.  That's right.  Not now.  You know you're fucking playing with fire when before you go away you have to check the state laws? 
[03:29:30]  Yes.  Yes, it is.  You got to make sure, you know, but.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Some of these guys are going brutal with this.  Fucking uncomfortably brutal.  Well.  I didn't expect pediatrics.  That threw me for a bit of a loop.  Yeah.  But I got to tell you.  No crowd.  They get right to you. 
[03:30:00]  It's pretty good.  We had to walk through.  We had to walk through the regular emergency room area to get to the pediatric.  Pediatric one.  And there's some woman yelling.  But what's her blood pressure?  Like some.  I guess some woman and her mother were there.  And the mother's some old bag.  And she's in there with, you know, getting a blood pressure taken.  And this woman's yelling at a nurse.  And she goes.  You asked me three times already and I told you.  Well, what is it?  And it's just like pandemonium.  And then we go into pediatrics and it's like. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, this is nice.  Wow.  There's only a few rooms.  There's no commotions going on.  Everyone's nice.  But why is a person who's of age legally, why are they asking, does your family know if  you're sexually active?  I don't know.  She's old enough.  I know how old she is.  She's old enough legally.  Oh, I don't think it was.  To join the military.  To be executed in every state.  It's, you know.  I don't think they were asking, does your family know if you're sexually active?  I think they were asking, does your family know that you're with an old ghoul? 
[03:31:00]  But again, that's none of their fucking business.  She's a legal adult.  Well, it certainly isn't.  None of their fucking business.  You know, I guess they wanted to know if I was, you know.  Again, none of that.  They wanted to satisfy their own curiosity.  Yeah, that's all that is.  Yeah.  Boy, that really did kind of.  Teddy from New York writes, right now she's talking to the social worker.  And they're asking her to show them where the bad man touched her.  You shut the fuck up.  And no, I didn't take her there in a car seat. 
[03:31:30]  You fucking people.  Let's say hi to Scott in Chattanooga.  Show us on the doll where he touched her.  Yeah, Scott, Chattanooga.  Hey, while you were waiting, did you get caught up on all those Spongebob episodes you missed?  No, there wasn't Spongebob on the TV.  Nice.  There aren't many pediatric patients at that hour in the morning for some reason.  You know, I guess kids ain't up. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  They're sleeping.  They can get a little baby aspirin or something and they're fine until the morning.  But I do have to, you know, get back there at some point.  To the whole pediatric ward now I go into.  I get to walk in there and be a complete creep all over again.  Hi.  I can picture Anthony saying hi, like peeking in the window.  Hi.  Embarrassed and kind of creepy.  The roommate kid starts crying. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  So you had a rusher there in the middle of the night?  Well, it wasn't like a rush job, you know.  It wasn't like that.  But, you know, you get a little concerned.  Sure.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  I was going to suck.  Yeah.  People want to know if she brought her blankie.  They give them blankies there, thank you very much.  Well, she probably wants her blankie.  Psychotic, right?  Did Chris Hansen tell you to take a seat in the waiting room to have some lemonade and a cookie? 
[03:33:00]  That is horrible.  So you've come to the emergency room.  Why don't you sit down?  All right.  You're free to go.  The cops put their knee in my neck in the hallway.  Let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry!  Morning.  Morning, Larry.  Hey, Anthony.  How important is the age of consent?  Very.  Very important. 
[03:33:30]  So the nurses...  Are you sure?  Nobody would talk to you?  No, they kind of talked to me.  Yeah.  Standoffishly.  I was sitting in the room at one point when the doctor came in, and he goes, well, we're  just going to ask her a few questions.  Who are you?  And I said, I'm a friend.  And he goes, all right, you'll have to step out of the room.  And I had to get up and just kind of skulk out of the room like a fucking...  Is that the way it would be, though, with anyone or no? 
[03:34:00]  Horrible guy.  I would guess so.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Unless it's family.  Yeah, for the most part.  You know.  They say that.  Especially in pediatrics.  It's horrible.  Anthony Polanski.  Let me say hi to Corinne in Jersey.  When Ant walked into pediatrics, did the whole staff yell, Norm!  Norm!  Anthony Glitter.  All right.  Yes.  Let's go to Corinne in Jersey.  Corinne.  Ant, I want to know, are you going to take her to Toys R Us when she gets discharged 
[03:34:30]  for being such a brave big girl?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to do that.  And Corinne knows how to call a radio show.  She's gone.  Let me say hi to your favorite therapist.  Oh, no.  Lydia from Oceanside.  Oh, Christ.  Hello, Lydia.  Hi, boys.  Hi, Lydia.  You're laughing today, aren't you, Lydia?  What's my problem now, Lydia? 
[03:35:00]  Well, let's listen in.  Lydia knows a thing or two about creeps.  Go ahead, Lydia.  I've been really trying to lay off, Anthony.  I let the panic room go.  All the dreams.  The drunken Halloween party.  But you yourself said that maybe you needed to look at your life.  No, I didn't say that.  I said I felt like a creep.  Do I really care?  Eh, not really. 
[03:35:30]  Once I was out of there, I was fine.  It's just being in there.  It's a little awkward, you know, because it's pediatrics.  But Anthony's not doing anything wrong by dating somebody younger.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's who he likes to date.  Yeah.  There is nothing wrong with being with someone younger.  Absolutely not.  There is something wrong with avoiding people of a certain age 
[03:36:00]  because you can't connect with people on an adult level.  Yeah, so?  I can't.  I don't like people my own age.  They're stupid and not fun.  Yeah.  But you're about to spend your own age.  You know what was really odd?  Being in there and they started, like, in the triage area,  they took our blood pressure.  And I was like, I was just talking today about the blood pressure thing  being around my heart on.  That's right.  You should have told them that.  And there it was. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, that would have really, that would have upped the creep factor.  You know, let me tell you a cute little dream I had last night.  Just only a mere few days ago.  But it was so odd.  No, it was that day.  That day, you're right.  You're right.  I was talking about it.  And then there I was looking at the blood pressure thing going,  wow, that's a weird coincidence.  Yep.  I haven't seen one of those in a while.  And there I am right there looking at that.  Well, what do you got, Lydia?  Anything else?  You're not really delving into this one.  I guess I want to tell Anthony not to talk about the dreams in the panic room 
[03:37:00]  when he takes his young girlfriend to the ER  because the psych ER is probably right next door.  Oh, don't even worry about it.  I'm fine mentally.  There's nothing wrong with an older man liking young broads  because he doesn't want to connect with an older broad.  There's nothing wrong with that.  All they do is fucking bitch and complain.  Listen, everyone wishes he was you, Anthony.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  I guess I'm just worried about the total picture, the panic room, the dream. 
[03:37:30]  It's not a panic room as much as it's a gun safe,  but it's big so, you know, you could fit in it.  It's a secure place.  See, I'm being responsible.  It's a secure place for firearms that is alarmed and locked with an electronic lock.  And if, you know, I'm in there, I would be locked in there,  but I could then get out whenever I wanted to.  What's wrong with that?  In this day and age of crime and crime. 
[03:38:00]  Well, you know, I don't want to constantly lay into you for the same old things.  I just wish you would consider maybe checking out eHarmony or something like that.  eHarmony?  You know what?  That fucking commercial creeps me out.  You ever see the one with the fucking laughing Asian girl on the beach with her dog?  That has got to be the creepiest fucking bitch I've ever seen.  She's looking at the camera, petting her dog on the beach, and it's black and white, 
[03:38:30]  and then she goes...  And then to like five seconds later, she goes...  It's like, who wants to date that fucking nut?  Monatics!  Speaking of dating sites, my bro-in-law first tweeted it, and Joe Rogan tweeted it, I think two days ago.  It's a montage of a video dating site of all these fucking loser guys from the 70s.  Oh, really?  Your best foot forward?  That's a good one.  Could you find that?  I know Joe Rogan tweets a lot, so it might be a little tough, but JoeRogan.net, I think 
[03:39:00]  it is on Twitter, if I'm not mistaken.  Oh, I'm not going to eJailbait.  Why don't you consider one of those, man?  Why?  I'm not looking for some fucking online dating girl.  Let's like, you know, Facebook.  Right.  Well, Lydia, you didn't really add much to this, but I don't blame you, because this story  has kind of stopped a lot of people in their tracks.  Really? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, it's a weird one to go with.  Yeah.  Because, you know, there is some concern there.  You've got to make sure she's okay.  Well, I'm very concerned.  I'm just talking about me being a...  You know, that's why I have the ding-ding on, because on my phone, so I could just get  updates, you know?  I'm just surprised you did the right thing and took her to the hospital yourself, instead  of getting someone else to do it.  Oh, I was kind of thinking maybe Keith could have...  No.  I have to say, I'm very impressed that Anthony did not leave her in the desert to die. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, because that's the type of person I am.  Well, it's a fucking Saudi Arabia joke.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, you know.  Terrible.  That's actually a pretty good line from Lydia.  That's all I am.  That's actually good, you big-titted monster.  Yeah, you came up with a good one.  Okay, guys.  There goes Lydia.  Oh, God.  Medication time.  Hey, this is Dr. Lydia from Oceanside.  The following is my professional diagnosis of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:40:30]  Opie is suffering from intermittent explosive disorder.  Anthony has schizoid personality disorder with paranoid features.  Plus, he drinks too much.  Norton, oof.  I'm going to have to punch out on that one.  He's an annuity for any therapist.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[03:41:00]  On the Opie and Anthony show, Anthony told the audience that he recently had to bring a young lady he was seeing to the hospital.  Unfortunately, the young lady was a bit too young.  And was admitted into the pediatrics unit.  We reached out to some ONA staffers to get their opinions.  Hey, Troy Kwan.  How surprised were you to find out that Anthony had to take a woman that he was seeing to the pediatrics unit of the hospital?  I think it's great, man.  I think most guys his age are probably jealous of it, I would say. 
[03:41:30]  Is that where you'd like to be when you're at his age?  Of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  I would think most guys his age are probably jealous of such behavior.  Mars, the girl that Anthony is seeing, she had to go to the hospital and she was admitted to the pediatrics unit.  Are you surprised?  Was she a preemie baby?  A preemie baby?  Oh, I don't know.  Pediatrics, asthma, right?  That asthma problem, right? 
[03:42:00]  Mars, are you reusing Opie's jokes?  I gotta go.  Where are you going?  I gotta go.  Hey, Danny.  Yo.  Are you surprised about Anthony having to bring the lady that he's seeing to the pediatrics unit of the hospital?  No.  No.  No.  Not really, no.  Is it something that you think he should be proud of or embarrassed by?  For a man of his caliber, I believe that you should be proud of such a thing.  Okay.  I mean, that is quite a feat, and I hope to accomplish that when I'm Anthony's age. 
[03:42:30]  Good for you.  Next, we found Nicole from the Morning Mashup to get the female perspective.  Hey, Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  How are you?  I'm doing okay at primetime, Sam Roberts.  Today on the show, Anthony said that the young lady that he's seeing, he had to bring her to the hospital last night.  And when he got there, they checked her into the pediatric unit, which embarrassed him.  Are you surprised by that? 
[03:43:00]  Well, how old is she?  He said she is of age.  Oh, dear.  You look sort of alarmed.  I am alarmed.  This is a little creepy and weird.  So if you were in a hospital with, say, a young niece or someone, and you walked into the pediatric unit with her and saw Anthony, and he said he was there with his friend, would that be something that creeped you out?  Uh, yeah, it would, actually. 
[03:43:30]  Um, yes, very much.  I think you should reevaluate the situation and, uh, make some changes.  Obviously, there's a difference of opinions on the matter.  All we can do is hope that Anthony's friend makes it out of the hospital okay and gets a sucker for being such a good girl.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  You're listening to the worst of 2009.  More coming up next on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, welcoming all the new subscribers. 
[03:44:00]  Hello.  All the new suckers.  Joining us after turning on their new XM and Sirius radios.  Describe the show a bit.  Well, it's a little bit of this, and then we do a little of that.  And we throw in some la-la-la-las.  Uh, thanks for checking us out.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  See, this describes it better.  Just play this.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony's worst of 2009.  Hosted by, guess who? 
[03:44:30]  Hmm, I don't know.  Sam and E-Rock.  Again?  Yep.  On The Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, it wouldn't be a really good countdown if we didn't highlight some of the achievements of our comic friends.  Of course.  And luckily for the Opie and Anthony show, one of the comics that we know is completely retarded.  Well, there's no one else we could throw in there as a funny line. 
[03:45:00]  It has to be Rich Voss.  Take it away, Voss.  No one's going to listen to that.  Yeah, they will.  I fucking carry this show sometimes.  Okay?  Believe you me.  You don't think I sometimes say a thing on purpose to get reaction to build, huh?  What did I say today that I knew I was saying wrong?  But I still did it as a team player.  Right here, if you listen to this, this, I'm not going to fucking lie.  I've had a couple blunders in my life.  A couple mistakes.  Okay? 
[03:45:30]  Now, one's in college and the other one's going to graduate.  But this was one of my biggest mistakes.  If you listen, you'll see what I did.  And believe you me, I paid for this mistake.  I paid and I learned a lesson.  That ONA listeners don't let anything get by them.  I'm telling you, within a fucking second of any...  Do you know what ONA listeners...  You know what you guys are like? 
[03:46:00]  You're like fucking sharks.  You really are.  You're like out of shape sharks.  But you're sharks.  Or vultures.  Or you see a weakness.  Or you see a mistake.  But within seconds, boom.  You just swoop in or you attack.  You know, you can't really swoop in or attack quick.  But you try.  You know what I mean?  But you guys don't miss a fucking thing.  It's unbelievable.  You don't miss a thing.  Anyhow, this is one of my blunders.  Wow.  It's number 14 on the Worst of 2009 Countdown. 
[03:46:30]  It's the Worst of 2009.  Rich Voss.  Here you go for Rich Voss.  Rich Voss dot com.  Rich Voss on MySpace.  Yeah.  What's your Twitter thing?  I don't fucking Twitter.  Rich Voss.  Twitter.  I don't know how to do that.  What do you mean you don't Twitter?  I Twitter all the time.  I got fucking...  I love it.  So I'm asking you what you're...  Wait, you just said you don't know how to do that.  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  You can give a Twitter address?  Nobody acknowledged you talked.  I don't know.  No promotion for your Twitter today. 
[03:47:00]  Twitter Rich Voss, I guess.  No, it's not that.  What is it?  It's certainly not that.  Did you pick a name when you signed up for Twitter?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh my God.  Don't...  You know what?  You don't get the promotion for your Twitter.  Comic 630.  That's your Twitter name?  I think so.  Comic 630.  Why?  What's wrong with you?  What do you mean what's wrong with you?  You come out of a profession, your age, and then a zero.  How about you work off the name Rich Voss?  How about you work off the name Rich Voss? 
[03:47:30]  Maybe Rich Voss is taken, so you do Rich Voss asshole.  Would it say on here?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe it is Rich Voss.  He doesn't know.  What's the Comic 630 thing?  You're still using a stylus?  Obviously, you're not.  Oh, shit.  He does lob him back at you, Jim.  Game on today.  He's prepared.  It's at Rich Voss.  Hey, maybe a fan could call up and tell everyone what Rich Voss' Twitter thing is. 
[03:48:00]  Because Rich really doesn't know.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss in studio.  We're trying to get to the bottom of his Twitter thing.  Someone, by the way, Rich, is saying that you do the worst tweets ever.  And by the way, your stupidity, it goes beyond reason.  Your stupidity just continues to amaze.  Do you know what you did? 
[03:48:30]  Jimmy doesn't even have an idea.  You both were out of the studio, right?  What is your Twitter name?  Like, if someone wants to see your Twitter, what would they have to type in to see your Twitter?  Wait till you hear this one, Jimmy.  What is your Twitter name?  Rich Voss.  So you can go to www.twitter.com slash Rich Voss.  And you can start following Rich Voss.  Okay, so what was the thing you said earlier?  And what was the thing earlier?  Oh.  What was the comic thing? 
[03:49:00]  I don't know.  Don't say it, because it might be something else.  Oh, it might be?  No, it is something else.  And everyone fucking picked up on it.  And they are hacking the shit out of your Twitter site right now.  Rich Voss gave out his password for his Twitter account.  That comic thing that he gave out earlier?  That was his password.  And lucky, most step from Kentucky now owns your Twitter.  And it said, look at the big post he put.  He gave his password.  What an idiot.  Rich.  I didn't even know Twitter had a password. 
[03:49:30]  So some dude from Kentucky now controls your Twitter.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Can you tweet that I'll be at Marco Island next week?  Now he just sees it as some guy that he's hired to.  I'm glad I got somebody running my shit.  Fucking, I was getting tired of these little tweets.  You were getting tired of trying to come up with clever tweets?  Can you put a new, I don't want to lose all the people I'm following.  It's not yours anymore.  Unless this guy does the right thing and gives it back to you.  All the people, you have 3,000 people that follow you. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie's got over 30,000.  Oh, really?  The guy on the radio has over 30,000?  And I have.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  You're the guy on the radio right now.  He gives out the address.  You give out the password.  Oh, wait.  It's little Nicky.  Let's all look at little Nicky.  He's got a suitcase today.  He's got a suitcase.  He's rolling a suitcase down the hall.  There's a little Nicky.  All right, back to Rich Voss.  So, Rich, we do that to that guy every day.  He's late today. 
[03:50:30]  It's usually 820.  I know.  It is a little late.  Rich.  Voss gave out his fucking ass.  How great is that?  That is typical Voss.  Oh, man.  That's great, Rich.  Wow.  Wait.  This guy's trying to call in.  I think.  Oh, wait.  We might have the guy.  Who's this?  This is Mo Stepp from Kentucky.  Hey, Mo Stepp, if it's really you, how about you tweet, I'm Rich Voss and I suck cocks.  Yeah, go ahead. 
[03:51:00]  Do that.  Do a lie.  I love this.  Can you do that?  You big Jew knows you're pathetic.  I'm pathetic?  Listen, big nose.  Actually, he has to come up with a tweet.  Say it on our show and do it at the same time.  And that'll prove that you have control of Rich Voss' Twitter account.  Change his picture to something really stupid.  Find something on Google like a big dick.  It already is.  I didn't think of that.  He said, change his picture to something really stupid. 
[03:51:30]  And I said, it already is.  It already is.  See, because it's a picture of you, Rich.  I'm a very good looking man.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy wants a hug.  No, put something awful up there.  No.  Put a picture of him.  See?  No, he wrote, Jimmy wants a hug.  Jimmy wants a hug.  This guy has your account.  Yeah, he's got your account, dude.  That is fantastic.  I'm going to save you, Voss, okay?  Really?  Are you booking improvs?  Did you? 
[03:52:00]  Hey, did you change the password?  Listen, Rowan couldn't book you, buddy.  What's that?  Rowan couldn't get you a gig.  Did you change the password?  Yes, I did.  He did right away.  He's not stupid.  What did he do?  He changed your password.  To what?  He's not telling you.  Yeah, to what?  Let's say it again.  Yeah, let him blurt it out so someone else can take it now.  It looks like a good guy's got your account.  Who's this guy right here?  I'm sure he'll, on hold, he'll give the password to Travis and he'll give it back to you. 
[03:52:30]  But in the meantime, yeah, write, I'm Rich Voss.  I love cock.  Cut.  Make sure it's cut.  Actually, I'm Rich Voss would just fucking cover that.  I'm Rich Voss.  I love black cock.  Can you put a space between my name?  No, stupid.  It's just like your account name.  Oh, okay.  Listen, don't call me stupid. 
[03:53:00]  With that accent, we're going to try to build a relationship.  With that accent, he got your password and now runs your fucking Twitter site.  Hey, can you update my MySpace and my Facebook?  Why don't you get that password out over the air?  Those are numbers.  I don't even know those.  This is going to work in your favor.  Now people are going to want to follow you to see what this guy from Kentucky writes for you.  You should let him have it for a few days.  All right.  It's a good promotion for you.  Rich Voss, one word on Twitter to see what Moss Def. 
[03:53:30]  And it's one S.  A lot of people spell it with two.  Yeah, I know.  Really?  Yeah.  Leave off the last S for failure.  Yeah, we know what that S is for.  Exactly.  Moss, hold on the line, all right?  That's the password for everything.  What do you mean for everything?  They said, don't even look at his MySpace account.  Oh, no.  Do you use one password for everything?  You don't.  I'll go to his MySpace.  This is too good.  And it has to be said on the radio because the feedback is ridiculous. 
[03:54:00]  Rich, read what I wrote.  They pretty much got a hold of your bank accounts at this point.  Not on any of that stuff.  Read what I wrote to you on this paper silently.  Out loud.  Yeah.  Can you read that?  Yeah.  It's in the mic.  What do you mean?  Read it out loud?  Yeah.  May 22nd, 23rd.  No, no.  What I wrote.  What I wrote.  Change your email, password, et cetera.  I wrote that after he gave out that, after that came out.  Because I know he has the same password. 
[03:54:30]  He must have the same password for everything.  Oh, my God.  No, not for Facebook, I don't think.  Oh, yes, you do.  Oh, really?  Wait, Travis.  Travis, what the fuck?  Hey, you know what?  Here's the thing.  They got control of your Facebook, your Twitter, and your MySpace.  Good.  Maybe they'll fucking help me.  I'm getting tired of doing this shit anyhow.  Let's see his Facebook.  Let's see.  Let's see what they did to it.  Quick, change my password.  I don't know.  I wonder if I'm your friend, Rich.  I don't know. 
[03:55:00]  All right, let's see what happens.  Oh, Rich.  What the fuck?  Let's see.  Rich Moss.  And it's coming up.  Oh, wait.  He didn't do anything.  Hold on.  What?  He didn't do anything yet, so.  Okay.  Who owns Rich's Facebook page now?  Travis does?  Ah, Travis nailed it.  Why?  Why?  Because you gave out your password.  Not for Facebook.  It's not the same one for Facebook.  Travis?  Well, MySpace isn't the same.  Well, it's not the same now. 
[03:55:30]  Okay, but MySpace wasn't, my password wasn't that on MySpace.  Oh, my God.  Bobby Kelly's things are annoying me.  They should be, right?  Oh, God.  Yeah, change something, Travis.  Go ahead.  Have some fun with it.  How about the mood?  Yes.  Yes.  Change his mood.  Feeling like a toothy retard.  Jesus, Rich.  What's the matter with you?  Rich is feeling dumb.  I'm not feeling dumb at all.  I'm feeling...  We didn't pick up on the fact that he was giving out his password. 
[03:56:00]  It was such an obvious, like, password-type word.  Yeah, exactly.  And none of us picked up on it.  Wow.  What are you calling?  I am a toothy retard.  There it is.  What's that on?  Facebook.  That's your Facebook.  Oh, I may be...  That's your same name.  Now I've been hacked.  Yep, it is.  That's...  Wow.  Brilliant.  That's fucking rich.  I like this. 
[03:56:30]  We gotta do a little back and forth, because Rich Voss' Twitter is now promoting Jimmy Norton  and Scott in Quakertown.  I see Rich Voss is now following Britney Spears.  I always was.  Look at what he's trying to do there.  That last picture.  Oh, was that infuriating.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He did it?  What happened?  Rich just got a Facebook password reset confirmation to his Black Mary. 
[03:57:00]  Who owns my Facebook, Travis?  Oh, he's not a bad guy.  I sure he is.  Really?  Not a guy.  You ever hung out with him?  Let's say hi to Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Hey, Bob.  Hello.  It's Jimmy.  Bob.  Wait, wait.  Rich Voss' Twitter picture is now Jim Norton in his underwear.  What a fucking idiot he is. 
[03:57:30]  He gave out his password on the radio.  That's why we're talking to Anonymous.  Anonymous.  What's up, Anonymous?  Hey, Bob.  Voss ran out of the studio.  He's in a bad attic mode.  He's on a cell phone.  What do you got, Anonymous?  He just bought 400 hotel tickets on Priceline.com.  Oh, no.  Was that his Priceline?  Holy shit. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, they're going to kill this guy.  What do you have?  One password for everything.  No one has one.  Because you're a blithering idiot.  You can't do that.  You don't have one password ever.  Those Bobby pictures are fucking huge.  Who needs 9,000 by 4,000 resolution?  It's true.  You're right.  You're right.  He wants people to print him up.  He wants people.  His Twitter picture is hilarious.  It's the Jimmy in his underwear pushing his gut out picture. 
[03:58:30]  Oh, is that fantastic, man?  Is he following anybody stupid?  Oh, I mean, himself.  Only he would fucking blurt out his password.  Holy shit.  What an idiot.  That is really, really funny.  Oof. 
[03:59:00]  Goddamn Rich.  He's always good.  He's always fucking good.  He's not following me, by the way.  Motherfucker.  Is he not following?  No, he's following Opie.  He's not following me?  I've got to leave Bob Kelly a message.  Nope, he's not following me.  Well, go fuck yourself then.  Yeah, tell Rich to go fuck himself.  What's the matter?  Oh, boy.  Rich just made a face like, uh-oh.  Things okay, Rich?  You're making some calls?  Yeah.  You couldn't just come in and have a great appearance.  You're in the middle of a great appearance. 
[03:59:30]  Something always has to go wrong with you.  Always.  You're making some phone calls, Rich?  You've got to talk to some people?  Oh, I'm sorry that I made a mistake and gave out my password.  And how you do that is beyond me.  I'm amazed we didn't pick up on it.  We didn't pick up on it.  Because who would think somebody would be...  Our audience knows Rich better than we do.  They're like, that idiot just gave out his password.  And we're just sitting here going, that's not your name, stupid. 
[04:00:00]  And everyone else picked up on, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Think of the first guy that typed it in and went, click.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, it is.  Great.  Oh, shit.  But at least that's not my password for my password.  I don't even care about my password.  Someone just bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Paid for it with PayPal.  Rich is leaving the room again with his phone. 
[04:00:30]  His eyes got big when you read that in.  No, I don't even get...  Why don't you go make some phone calls?  They put the picture of him with his eyes shut.  They are fucking up all your pages, dude.  They just put the worst Rich Voss picture ever on his Facebook.  Rich, good news though.  You gained 200 followers.  I actually took that photo. 
[04:01:00]  People are following you.  Yeah, that's the photo I took of Richard.  Original Jim photo.  Oh, Sam's running in.  Ah.  No, he's running somewhere else.  What the fuck is he doing?  All right.  Wow, that is...  It's beyond me.  It's beyond me that someone could do that.  There might be a Rich Voss update.  What do you mean?  Give it a second.  What?  What, Sam?  Why is Sam laughing?  Sam laughing.  Oh, no, boys.  Guess who has his email address? 
[04:01:30]  You.  You?  Yes.  His email is the same one?  Oh, no.  Send out a mass email?  I'm actually glad.  I was worried about his email.  I'm actually glad that...  Yeah, that's some of our idiots.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what I was worried about.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  God.  The stupidity in this guy is just amazing.  It's just...  It's astounding. 
[04:02:00]  I would never give out...  Like, you know your passwords.  Dude, mine...  You just don't ever blurt them out like that.  I couldn't even blurt mine out.  I wouldn't know how to pronounce it.  He actually fucking put...  Put?  Put?  Fuck you.  Oh, shit.  But I've been working on it.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's funny. 
[04:02:30]  I'm gonna...  Picture of Rich.  It's so utterly bad.  I know.  Jim in Cleveland.  Jim.  Yeah.  It's Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's your name?  Oh, Jeremy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know I bought some dryer doors for Voss.  Dryer door.  Puts it out.  It could be one of the top...  That's one of the greatest things that's ever happened.  One of the greatest dummy moments.  Voss dummy moments. 
[04:03:00]  And there are so many of them.  Look at him marching down the hall trying to get things done now.  I gotta change my password to Louie Beans.  I love Rich.  He's in a full pack.  Oh, he's pacing the hallway on that phone trying to shut everything down.  Damage control right now.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's gonna make me laugh for weeks.  Yeah.  Not even for the day.  Weeks.  But that's why you never use, like, the same name and password for everything. 
[04:03:30]  Like, like, cause, not, not because you're gonna blurt it out on an international radio show.  You never do.  I have a bunch of different ones.  Yeah.  Sometimes they get all fucked up.  You ever put in one username and then you can't remember which password you use?  I've forgotten them.  Yeah, I've forgotten them.  And then you gotta run through all of them.  And then you got those, you got those sites that sometimes only allow you to do it three times before it shuts it down for a half hour.  Yeah, I know.  And then you got one last try and you're like, is this the one?  That's what happened to my phone recently.  Doink.  And then what happens, then they erase the whole phone. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, you have a set like that?  Really?  It's a corporate phone and all of a sudden they change the password or I don't know.  And by the third time I watched that bar thing go wiping out everything.  Ooh, that sucks.  What a nightmare that was.  His voice Twittered a lot recently.  Yeah.  All I see is my fat stomach on every one of his tweets.  It's great.  It's the picture of Jimmy's gut. 
[04:04:30]  Please don't mess his thing up.  Just please promote something on his Twitter.  That makes me so happy.  He's getting so many followers, though, because of this.  Yeah.  It might work out for you in the end, Rich.  What do we got?  I got him.  I got him.  What do you mean you got him?  I got him.  It's my name.  It's Danny's name.  Oh, so you got his Twitter?  All right.  Go to town, Danny.  Rich, you all right?  I've never seen you sweat.  Huh?  You are sweating, my friend. 
[04:05:00]  Hold on, Ken.  We'll get to you in a sec.  Yeah.  You all right there, Rich?  Well, you know, Comic 630 is me and my birthday.  So you would think I'm a comic and I put my birthday.  It's easy to remember.  You were born in June?  I know.  No, in February, in February, and I'd like to add on a couple months.  That's exactly the year.  Of the year.  Wow, I am coming up so short. 
[04:05:30]  Dammit.  Oh, that's funny.  But everything is done.  Hold on.  I got to.  Everything is.  You all right now?  What?  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Thank you.  Oh, Voss is tweeting my dates.  Thank you.  I don't mind.  Look at your new picture.  Put your glasses on.  Norton in his horrendous underpants.  How do I take this back?  You don't.  You don't.  What do you mean I don't?  It's still mine.  I can still go on it myself. 
[04:06:00]  You can.  Try going on your Twitter right now.  Go update it.  Go ahead.  I can't.  No.  Twitter's something.  They got your password.  Look at the followers you're getting.  You're up to like 300, 400 new followers today because of this.  Full paw.  Hey, Reese in Maryland, what's up?  Hey, guys, you got to take a look at who he's following on Twitter now.  What's that?  Who's he following?  Make him follow a bunch of rappers.  Okay, he's following me. 
[04:06:30]  What is that?  Gay Times?  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Marriage Rights.  Gay Community.  Angry Gay Guy.  Gay Civil Rights.  Adult Gay Sex Porn.  Gay Porn Stud.  Gay Rights Watch.  Gay.com.  Post Gay.  Big Gay News.  And I'll bet that the fans even added some.  That's right.  You know. 
[04:07:00]  Here's the thing.  Let the laughs continue.  Damn it.  You were doing so well today, Rick.  I knew you would do something to blow it.  I didn't blow it.  How did I blow it?  Let people know that I called it today.  How did I blow it?  It's still a good appearance.  What the fuck?  No one's going to remember any of the lines you did today.  It's only about how stupid you are.  Rich, you had a great appearance.  But let me tell you something.  When you left the room before, Opie turns around and goes, Rich is on fire. 
[04:07:30]  He goes, and he's still going to call me up and ask, how was my appearance and stuff?  He goes, but, and he told me, he goes, but watch, he will fuck something up.  And, oh my.  I didn't even expect it to be this big of a fuck.  His what, Dan?  Rich's Wikipedia has been updated.  Well, I don't do any of that shit.  Of course you don't.  But that's not mine.  The last entry says, on May 20th, 2009, Rich gave out his personal password, Comic 630,  on the Opie Anthony radio show, leading to immediate hacking of his Facebook, Twitter, 
[04:08:00]  and email accounts.  Well, not my email.  They can't get to my email.  Oh, they can't?  Well, Sam's got that.  No, he didn't get it quick enough.  That was the call.  I had it.  And then the guy gave it back.  Oh, you gave it back.  He actually did the right thing.  Some of the guys are doing the right thing today.  Yes.  Which is kind of cool, to be honest with you.  See, this Twitter is really all I have.  No, the Kentucky guy, we're giving them a Jim Norton gizmo in a UFC video game.  Yeah, but who's putting all that gay shit on? 
[04:08:30]  Hello.  I love this Twitter account.  What I don't understand about Twitter, anybody.  Anybody could start a Twitter site and just take your picture and do it anyhow without  it, you know what I mean?  Being the fake Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Well, that's what it is now.  Yeah, so anybody could do this anyhow.  It's not like any big fucking deal.  So, you know, there was, on my, there was, well, son.  Give us your name.  What's that?  It's your name, though.  So now if you want to start another one, you have to spell your name differently. 
[04:09:00]  Holy shit, is that funny, Rich?  He's got it.  God bless you.  Holy shit.  Voss fucking rules their same.  In his stupidity, Voss fucking rules.  Bravo.  Put in head.  That's Steven S. from Bayshore.  All right.  Rich Voss, look at your new Twitter picture.  Look at that.  Oh, there.  Is it a horse's ass?  Yes.  That is a horse's ass.  An actual horse's ass.  Holy shit, Rich.  Oh, my God.  It's just quite a little, uh... 
[04:09:30]  It's just the greatest thing.  A horse's ass picture.  It says Rich Voss and then a plug for Jimmy's show.  Quite a po-fa.  And a bunch of gay followers.  A what?  Po-fa?  What's that word?  Oh, he didn't.  He didn't.  He didn't.  How great is it going to be when you hear that clip every time a caller bombs?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hey, where's my fa?  Oh, my God. 
[04:10:00]  What a fucking phidiot.  I seem to have lost my fa.  Gentlemen.  I officially have a headache from laughing so hard.  Oh, fuck.  By the way, they're giving you advice, Rich.  Oh, fuck.  Mormon Jim is checking in.  He writes, Rich probably changed his password to Comic230.  Please tell me you didn't do that.  You're not that dumb.  No.  Okay.  A po-fa. 
[04:10:30]  I made a po-fa.  It's great.  Eat it with chopsticks.  Oh, my God.  You would think after so many years, we just wouldn't be surprised or it wouldn't be funny anymore.  I think it's the depth of the well.  It's so amazing.  How could anyone not fucking love Voss?  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime, Sam Roberts. 
[04:11:00]  I'm Primetime, Sam Roberts, and regular guest, comedian, and idiotic friend of the show, Rich Voss, stopped by to say hello to ONA recently and accidentally gave his online password out on the air.  We caught up with Voss in the hallway after his Facebook, Twitter, email, and other such accounts had been hacked by listeners.  Voss, what happened today on the show?  Not that I just came in. 
[04:11:30]  I was a funny guy, and, you know, we had a good time.  A couple mistakes were made here and there.  Pretty much my mistake.  But what were you thinking, giving out your password?  That was your email password, your Facebook password, your Twitter password?  Why would you give that out on the air?  Yeah, it was a major profile, and believe you me, I fucked up.  And it sent me into a shamble.  Yeah, I saw you out here trying to figure out, making sure people could fix your email and trying to get your bank account straight and everything. 
[04:12:00]  I was just fucking sweating like Norton waiting for his AIDS result test.  No, that sucked.  Really?  It's AIDS test result.  But, of course, could that be a hackier fucking punchline?  No, Voss, it probably couldn't.  Lucky for us, Voss' entire family showed up at the studio, and we were able to talk to Voss' wife, comedian Bonnie McFarlane, about her husband's massive blunder.  You got a chance to see Voss today in all his glory.  I see him every day in all his glory. 
[04:12:30]  What went through your head when you got the phone call of Voss saying that he had just given out his email, Facebook, Twitter, and all account password on the air?  I just immediately thought everything was going to crash.  Everything.  That someone had a key to our house, our bank account was drained and dry, everything done.  Obviously, Voss and Bonnie didn't quite know what to say, so we located Voss' baby daughter and asked her how she felt about being the offspring of Rich Voss. 
[04:13:00]  Do you want to look out the window at the houses?  Thanks, everyone.  And don't worry, Voss.  Nobody would ever want to steal your identity anyway.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A.  Attention, college students.  Are you having trouble punching up that term paper?  Yeah, my professor is killing me.  Need to doctor your dissertation?  Oh, man, would I ever.  Impress your professors with a flurry of words from the new Vossipedia Online.
