<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Norton recounting a grueling trip back from Las Vegas, detailing multiple flight delays, long waits for luggage at LaGuardia (described as a terrible airport with a dangerous approach), and a tarmac delay at Kennedy due to gate shortages.  They complained about bad in-flight movies and cell phone use on planes, a sentiment echoed by a caller with an even worse travel story. The conversation then shifted to the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston breakup, leading to speculation about Angelina Jolie and a discussion about celebrity adoptions, specifically the adoption of non-white children.

The hosts then detailed their chaotic experience at the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas, describing the event as filled with "sluts and faggots" and recounting encounters with numerous porn stars, including Ron Jeremy and a detailed description of Anari Vox rubbing her ass on Opie's leg. They discussed Max Hardcore's career and criticized Gene Simmons for ignoring them despite a recent appearance on their show.  They praised their road manager, Club Soda Kenny, despite acknowledging conflicts with XM Satellite Radio.  This dissatisfaction with Gene Simmons continued into the next segment, focusing on Simmons' perceived arrogance and refusal to take a picture with one of the hosts.  This spurred a broader discussion about celebrity entitlement.

The AVN Expo was again discussed, detailing interviews with various porn stars, and their acquisition of pornographic items like clown sex videos, Paris Hilton's sex tape, and BDSM paraphernalia. A significant portion involved an explicit recounting of an encounter with transsexual porn star Vanity, and audio (of poor quality) of Vanity detailing Gene Simmons' alleged attempt to solicit her.  The hosts also discussed the prevalence of prostitution in Las Vegas, sharing anecdotes about encounters with prostitutes and the distribution of business cards.  The segment concluded with further discussions of sexual fetishes and listener calls.

Comedian Stephen Lynch then performed a song about dating a hermaphrodite. This was followed by discussions of a "Better Sex Kit" advertisement, Paris Hilton and "China" sex tapes, a woman who enjoyed being punched in the breasts, and a recap of their Las Vegas trip, including Kenny's antics (leading to a two-day suspension).  A highly explicit commentary on a homemade pornographic video featuring X-Pac and "China" followed, focusing on its poor production quality.  Kenny's sexually explicit interviews with porn stars from the AVN Awards were played.  Actor James Leisure called in to discuss his work on *Las Vegas*, while the porn video continued playing.

A subsequent segment heavily featured the AVN Expo, playing audio/video from multiple sources: interviews with Justin Slayer, a Black porn director known for explicit films like "Big Booty White Girls"; footage of four angry Chinese men confronting a security guard who scammed them; repeated showings and explicit commentary on the Paris Hilton sex tape; an interview with transsexual model Tanya; a brief mention of a "Lowrider" bouncy toilet interview; a short interview with gay porn star Sergio Rio;  extensive audio of Frankie Blue's drunken on-air meltdown at WNEW, including his verbal abuse of a female co-worker; and audio of Ashley Simpson's disastrous lip-syncing performance at the Orange Bowl. The hosts' commentary remained sexually explicit and crude throughout.

The final segment focused on Ashley Simpson's Orange Bowl performance, speculating on the reasons for the negative reaction and contrasting her with Kelly Clarkson and Trace Adkins.  They mocked a radio personality (possibly Howard Stern) for repeatedly saying "I don't care."  The segment also included audio clips of the Paris Hilton pornographic video (with graphic commentary) and a recording of Linda McCartney's allegedly isolated poor backing vocals on a Beatles song.  Listener calls, including a "What did we learn today?" segment, concluded the broadcast, interspersed with more audio clips and commercial breaks.

Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid. 
[00:08:00]  Shut up. Shut the fuck. You're all right. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.  Hey, I should have stayed home and played with myself. I wish we could have stayed home 
[00:08:30]  today. I know. Oh, yes. Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. The ONA virus  back from Las Vegas spreading back to New York City where we're broadcasting live. Oh, my  goodness. We told them, man. We told them, look, I don't think it's a good idea that we  do a radio show on Monday. Right. We were sitting at the Jack Black. See here, this 
[00:09:00]  is what's going to happen today. This is exactly what's going to happen. We were  sitting at the blackjack table talking to E. Lowe and Stray Lowe. Yeah. And telling  them, look, man, we gave you three good days of radio and we're going to travel all  day Sunday. I really think it would be best for everyone if we did a worst of. Yeah, we  did a Saturday show for God's sake. And they pretty much laughed at us. I worked 
[00:09:30]  them like one whole night. We're playing blackjack and E. Lowe was sitting next to  me and and Stray Lowe was like in another seat. And and I said, you know, perhaps we  should take Monday off because we're really going to be shot. We're coming in late on  Sunday. And, you know, it's going to be a mess. And I finally got E. Lowe to say, well,  it's up to Stray Lowe. Whatever he says, I'll go with it. And then I'm trying to  convince Stray Lowe that we don't want to work. Oh, and I got nowhere with him. I 
[00:10:00]  got nowhere with him. You got nowhere. Oh, I kept looking and smiling at me like a  mongoloid and nothing. I was like, you know, we really, really think maybe Monday  might be counterproductive and we get and, you know, he's just, yeah, double down.  Yeah. Well, now, now look what we do now. We do now. Damn. Next time you'll you'll 
[00:10:30]  listen to us, but please. Well, we flew in from Las Vegas probably, I don't know,  two hours ago. We flew all day. I know that much. It should not take that long to get  from Vegas to New York. It just shouldn't take that long. I don't understand it. We  could have, I heard people talking about flights to Hawaii and it was the same, same  amount of time. Yeah. We left, uh, the MGM last night or what? Or yesterday. I don't 
[00:11:00]  know. What time was it then? The MGM Grand. The MGM Grand. We left, I guess, yesterday  morning officially, like 430. Yeah. 430 in the morning. 430 in the morning. And, uh,  by the time those savages got our luggage on the carousel at LaGuardia, the worst place  to fly in into in America. Yeah. It's just an ancient airport. I know a lot of people  listening all over the country and they got crazy airports, but LaGuardia is insane to  begin with. First of all, they don't warn you that they have to take that sharp right 
[00:11:30]  turn where the tip of the wing is pretty much in that bay. What is it called? It's  called Flushing Bay. So the, I mean, the wing is literally in the water. Well, literally.  Well, all right. Pretty close. All right. I know. I know that I know the definition of  literally relax. It's pretty close. Okay. Yeah. And then they straighten out the plane  and then, uh, very short runway over there, very short runway. So they have to really, you  know, get the plane nice and low right over the bay. And by the way, uh, I don't know, 
[00:12:00]  I think it was about 10, 15 years ago. Uh, someone didn't make it because a couple of  times. Yeah. People would just end up in the Flushing Bay. Yeah. Because they didn't, they  didn't like, uh, you know, figure it out the right way. Yeah. And then you're looking out  your window and I swear to you, you're barely 10 feet above the bay. Yeah. And then all of  a sudden you skim onto the runway that just starts out of nowhere. Yep. That's LaGuardia.  Lots of fun coming into LaGuardia. And then, uh, then you get to LaGuardia and you, you know,  you have to wait 40 minutes for your luggage. I don't get that. Pain in the ass. And you're 
[00:12:30]  tired cause you flew all day. We finally, we finally got our luggage around seven at night,  I guess. So, so four 30 in the morning, we start our trip seven at night. We're finally  driving home seven at night. New York time. Remember? Yeah. Yeah. So you tack on another  three hours. It was, uh, it was fun for me. Oh my God. My flight, uh, I had, I had a stop  in Cincinnati for some reason. We all were on different flights, different stopovers. 
[00:13:00]  No one had a direct flight. Yeah. The three main guys of the radio show, myself, Anthony  and Norton. We all left about the same time from Vegas on three different flights. Three  different flights. I went through Houston. Norton went through Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland.  Yeah. And then Anthony went through Cincinnati. Cincinnati. Oh, you didn't go to, uh, you're  tugging. No, no, it was different this time. I went through Cincinnati and, uh, then we  get into a Kennedy. I landed a Kennedy airport. Nice big, you know, airport. Did we land at 
[00:13:30]  three different airports too? Where'd you land? Uh, LaGuardia. LaGuardia for me too. Oh,  okay. Which I hate. That right turn, right? Is scary as hell. I mean, the pilots could help  everyone out by just maybe explaining a few things because every airport has their things  they have to worry about, you know? They have to do in order to land there. Maybe it would  be a good idea to warn everyone that the plane's going to go on about a 45 degree angle because  they have to make a sharp right turn around Shea Stadium. That's the marker. Oh, Shea  Stadium trying to make a right turn. And if it's the first time you're flying into LaGuardia, 
[00:14:00]  you know, it scares the crap out of you. It'll scare you a little bit. You see the newbies  on the plane. They're like, what the hell is going on? I've flown many times, but I've  never seen the plane on a 45 degree angle before. Grabbing the armrests. San Francisco  is actually the same thing. You feel like you're going into the water because you don't see  the airport at all. You just see water, water, water, and then you get lower. You get lower,  lower, lower. Oh, it's awful. Then there's an airport I was trying to remember yesterday  in like the LA area. It might be Long Beach that you take off and then they have to go 
[00:14:30]  sharp and fast straight up. Like noise regulation. Like drastically. They drastically climb more  than any other airport. Is that what that's for? I don't know. Probably the noise. They  make so much noise. LaGuardia, they were making them do that for a while. I think they had to  take off. People complain. They move near an airport, but they complain. Almost straight  up. If you don't know this stuff, it freaks you out. But anyway, go ahead, Anthony. Kennedy  Airport. Yeah, I get into Kennedy and our pilot, he must have really been laying on the throttle 
[00:15:00]  there because he got us in, Opie, just about an hour early. Nice. Just about an hour early.  All right. Which is really nice. And then we get the announcement. Ladies and gentlemen,  you're a captain from the flight deck. We've gotten in a little early, but we have to pay  the price now. We don't have a gate available, so we're going to sit here and... I'm like,  what? What? There's no gate available. So we're going to sit here on this taxiway and  we'll get you further information as it comes in. And now everyone, now you're sitting on the 
[00:15:30]  plane, which is worse than the thing in the air. At least when it's in the air, you're doing  stuff or reading or watching the TV or something. When you're sitting on that runway and you can't  do anything, you still can't use your approved electronic devices. You can't do anything. You  have to stow your carry-on so you can't pull a book out of there or anything. So now you're  sitting. Dude, an hour. We sat on the runway for an hour while the gate cleared. It was wonderful. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, look at Jimmy's pissed and he wasn't even on that plane. And by the way, they lied. They  didn't get you in an hour early. They purposely do that on the tickets. They make it look  longer. Like, they add extra time on there just so they can land and say, we got you  in early. Right. Well, maybe you shouldn't have put six hours from New York to Cleveland  and you wouldn't have gotten me in early, stupid. You're absolutely right. I mean, it's  an old, like, hack comic bit, but they can get you there earlier. Do it. Make the plane  go faster. Whatever it takes. When do you hear the bit I have about the food on planes? 
[00:16:30]  It's a hard bag of peanuts they give you. The approved electronic devices. All right.  Let's stop with that crap. All right. You know, they're trusting us with our cell phones  not to turn them on in mid-flight because it might blow up the plane. Blow up the plane.  But I mean, seriously, what is your electronic devices really going to do? And if it was going  to do something, wouldn't they collect everything before you got on the plane? You would think  they would if it was really that dangerous. There really isn't anything. I'm trusting some 
[00:17:00]  loser from Wisconsin not to, you know, turn on a cell phone in mid-flight. Yeah. Turn  it off. Might possibly blow it up at one in a what? Um, who knows a billion. It's like  it supposedly, uh, interferes with the equipment they use to take off and land with. And, um,  they, they, they're not even sure if it does or not. One of those things. And I think in 2006,  they're going to allow cell phones on the plane as you're flying, which just the worst idea  ever. Yes. Yes. You know what? These chatty Cathy ass wipes sitting there all day, just 
[00:17:30]  yapping about nothing. You know what it's like on the train? It's a nightmare. They had to  make the goddamn quiet cars because you're sitting there and it's loud guy. I'm, you know,  maybe I'm just like self-conscious or something. But when I'm talking on the phone on the train,  it's like, Hey, how you doing? No, I'm on the train. Yeah. Yeah. And they hear me fine.  I could hear them. There's no reason to, yeah, well, we should be getting in about  six 30. There's no reason to yell. And it's the self-importance thing that they think everyone 
[00:18:00]  should hear the great stuff that they have to talk about. Yeah. You remind me of a story. I can't  tell you which brother, you know, you know, I have a lot of brothers. Yeah. My brother punched a guy  so hard in the face because he was too loud on his cell phone talking about, uh, the colored people.  Really? The guy's using the N word and stuff. And he's sitting next to my brother. My brother's  like, look, man, I really don't like that type of language. And, and you're really loud. And I  really would appreciate it if you would just, you know, you know, shut up basically. Right. 
[00:18:30]  And the guy, the guy at the beginning of that story, the guy's like, the guy's like, you know,  whatever, dude, you know, blah, blah, blah. And it continues. And he's just used the N word and the,  you know, and my brother, he's wound tight too. You know? Wow. He's like, I told you to,  I don't like that word and you're too loud and people are trying to sleep. My young son's in  the car. I don't like that kind of language. That kind of language. So my brother, like times  are perfect. His stop is coming, right? He just freaking wails and punched the guy. He 
[00:19:00]  says as hard as he's ever punched a guy. Wow. Square in the face and then just steps off  the train and gets away with it. Exactly what he deserved. And then they open it up on the  airplane. It's just going to be people. Cause you hear it at the gate when they still have  the, you're able to use the phone and you hear the people just with the rings, the stupid  ringtones. And now we're going to have that, the whole flight. Right. They finally figured  out a way to charge you. Here's why they, that was never about the plane. It was because 
[00:19:30]  they wanted you to use those stupid things on the front, the seat in front of you. They  figured they would jack your money by $20 a minute. Exactly. But they couldn't, no one would  use them because they're just awful phones. Yeah. So now they're going to put an antenna  on the plane and charge you probably $2 a minute. And it's never going to be any interesting  conversations. It's never like, you know, uh, yeah, I was getting blown and two strippers  that you don't mind here. And it's always some fat fuck talking about software sales business  thing. Awful, awful people with that ridiculous earphone thing in his head. Yeah. Uh, well, 
[00:20:00]  let me check my papers on that. I'm going to have to get back to you when we touch down.  Shut up. No one cares. You guys did without calling for how long on airplanes. And if you  have an emergency, use that stupid phone for 20 bucks a minute. It's not necessary. Please  keep the cell phones off the air. So what, uh, what movie did you have on the flight home?  Uh, well, great on the, on the way there we had Wimbledon. Oh, why do they pick the worst 
[00:20:30]  movies? Dude, always. So, you know, they should just have a few DVDs of the classics. Just  throw the Godfather on or right. You're going to Vegas, throw Casino on. Who wouldn't want  to see that? You know what I mean? No, they had Wimbledon. It's always the, the, the latest  were the latest movies that stink. The worst movies that, that are out and, and Wimbledon.  I didn't even watch it. I didn't have the headphones on or anything, but occasionally I peeked  up and looked at the screen. It's a stupid movie about tennis, a little chick flick, 
[00:21:00]  love story. And they tried to use some kind of matrixy effects through the whole movie  to spice it up, I guess, like tennis ball cam. And you know, the guy's doing his back  hand and they do like a matrix thing on him. Who's going to give a crap about this? It's  awful. Yeah. They're all family friendly movies too. On the planes. You can't play like  casino. Yeah, I know. I know. But you can't know. I saw Dawn of the Dead on a plane.  Get out. It was in first. I, uh, upgraded the first and had the nice, uh, sleeper seats 
[00:21:30]  with the, uh, all right. Isn't that great? With the 10, when you had your own screen  though, and you get the five or six different flips. Yeah. Yeah. Well, then they could do  it. Yeah. Dawn of the Dead was a violent movie, man. That was on the plane. Well, there's  enough movies out there that are quote family friendly that are still entertaining. Yeah.  What movie did you have on the way home? Don't, um, don't remember. I felt, I actually  slept the whole way from, uh, Vegas to Cleveland and there's nothing under the fight. On the  way home, it was hero that, that, uh, you know, Kung Fu movie. I don't know. I don't  know that one either. Yeah. It was, yeah. It's one of those Kung Fu movies, like hidden 
[00:22:00]  crouching, hidden tiger dragon thing. But, uh, our, our aisle that we were in first class  and the headphones didn't work in the whole aisle. And then some, some, uh, well, here's,  here's a reach a gay male flight attendant because you never see that. Is there an, are there  any straight male flight attendants? Why? Why would you take that job? Not a one. All  the straight guys are pilots. Yeah, of course. Not a one. Every time it's like, hello, welcome. 
[00:22:30]  Would you like something to drink? Oh, always. These guys are out of the same mold. Unbelievable.  And he starts flipping switches by the cockpit there. Cockpit. To try to get the middle thing  to work. And then I'm just like, Hey, slow down. Stop flipping switches. We'll do without.  Get a little nervous when they start doing that. You expect to see that smoke filling  the cockpit or something. But I had my, my little DVD player. So I just brought a bunch  of Seinfeld. Well, yeah, I brought my portable DVD player because they were, um, they were 
[00:23:00]  showing taxi. Oh, that's the show on the way out for me. What a funny movie. That, that  all just like you. I didn't need to plug in to know how bad that movie was, man. Was she  playing the spunky black chick? Yeah, of course. And she was, I guess she was at one of the  taxi drivers. I don't know. Awful. It just looked really, really bad. Jimmy Fallon's  And that was the movie on the way out. And that was the movie way, uh, on the way back  in. So I had my DVD player. So I did some honeymooners. I did some family guy. Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  And then I did, uh, uh, Harold and Kumar, the, uh, the White Castle movie. Oh, how was  that? It was kind of funny. Yeah, it's kind of funny. I want to see that. And, and it's  two movies that look ridiculous, but something about them was funny. Uh, Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah. Cause that kind of looks really funny. Harold and Kumar, it had its moments and,  uh, the Doogie Howser as playing himself was really funny in the movie. Really? Oh  yeah. But then I, uh, I was telling Steve in the van from the airport back to the city  that I had a problem with Harold and Kumar and he brought up a good point. There's a, I'm 
[00:24:00]  not giving anything away. Trust me, but don't ruin it. Yeah. Near the end of the movie, the  cops are chasing Harold and Kumar and they got a stolen, like, um, you know, uh, uh,  uh, uh, uh, like some, uh, I know I can't even think today. Of course we can't. This  is what you get. All the lows down at Washington. They, they stole like a, like some kind of  a, you know, a trailblaze or something. It has a hang glider on the top. Okay. You know,  so they, they drive and somewhere in Jersey that happens to have cliffs. Maybe you could explain 
[00:24:30]  where that is. I don't even know. So they go right to the end of the cliff. So they  can't go on. It's a famous movie thing. They can't go any further. Oh my God. What are  they going to do? And the, and the truck is kind of teetering off the edge and they have  to get out and it's pitch dark. Okay. And, uh, also they're like, what are we going to  do? What are we going to do? The cops are on the way. They're right behind, literally  said they're right behind us. So they see the hang glider. So, Oh, they get the idea.  They're going to hang glide down this cliff because the white castle's in the valley there 
[00:25:00]  or whatever. Okay. So it's, it's dark. The cops are on their tail. They have to do  something immediately. They see the hang glider. So now the next scene cuts to bright, sunny  day and they're in full hang glider gear. And now they're ready to jump off the, uh,  the cliff to get to the white castle. What's that about? It was like, what? Was it a film  flub? I, yeah. So I, I, we talk about film flubs on the show all the time. It just ran  out of darkness. I don't know because the stupid thing is, you know, the cop and then 
[00:25:30]  the cop finally pulls up. So what? He's been driving for three hours to get to this point.  Right. And I'm like, it took me out of the movie, man. I'm all pissed off. Right. So Steve  goes, I can't believe you watched it. I said, Steve goes, that took you out of the movie,  but the pot smoking cheetah that gave him a ride through the suburbs, you were, you're  okay with that. Oh really? Cause there's a scene where they get this stupid cheetah high  and then they jump on its back and, and, uh, go for a ride. I was okay with that. Yes.  That kept me in the movie, but going from dark to, you know, daytime, that took me out 
[00:26:00]  of it. You sure they didn't do that on purpose? Like to be kind of silly and funny and like  an Ed Wood way? Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. Perfect. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. It just  goes night to day immediately. So he may have knocked over a tombstone in real life. He was  a large man. It might've been hard for him to walk. Let's take our first call here. Let's  say hi to Tom and PA. What's up, Tom? Hey guys.  What's going on? Hello. Uh, you guys, you guys are bitching a little too much about your 
[00:26:30]  flight. Mine was worse. All right. Go ahead. Uh, it was out in August. It was extremely hot.  They got us on the plane. Uh, and then they tell us once we're out on the runway, we got  to sit and wait until they clear the, clear the runway in the opposite direction because  our plane's too heavy to take off in the humid weather. So two hours later, they finally get  us in the air. Then they tell us that they served all the fruit, the food, the first  class, no food left over for us. This guy's conversation. I feel like I'm on the plane 
[00:27:00]  right now. So we're, uh, dude, you know what? You're driving me nuts. Wow. I understand  it's early, sir, but why the pauses after every sentence? Sorry. That's what's true. I mean,  your story stinks to begin with, but, but then after every sentence, you're like, you're taking  a pause. Oh, okay. Are you breathing into an oxygen mask and you need oxygen after every  sentence? All right. It gets better. We fly in, we land in Atlanta. Then they tell us it's a, 
[00:27:30]  it's a connecting flight. We're staying on to head to Pennsylvania. We stay on the plane. They tell  us we can't go in and get any food. We got to wait for the other people to get on. So now we sit  there for an hour. I can't believe we gave them a second chance. The new load to get on. Once the  new load gets on, they back us away from the gate. Shut up. Shut the fuck. You're all right to take  me. Shut up. Will you shut up? Shut up. Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. You shut up. 
[00:28:00]  You shut up. You shut up. You shut up. You shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. You shut up. Shut up.  Shut up. So they can't bring food onto this other thing because they're waiting for other  passengers to board. I don't know. Oh my God. Ponderous. Oh, dude, I didn't tell you that you  want to hear about a bad flight story on the way out actually. No, no, no, no, no, no. On  the way out, it was, um, I don't know how you, how you guys, how your flight was. Um, we were 
[00:28:30]  all going to Cleveland to go to Vegas, but in first class, dude, get ahold of, I swear to God,  the cinnamon rolls were not as warm as I liked them to be. Isn't that horrible? And sometimes  they were a little hard around the edge. Yeah. I like a little bit of a fresher, warmer  cinnamon roll. Exactly. We were talking about how awful our little breakfast was, was, wasn't  coach. Like I had a, I have a rugby banana and some awful cereal, I think. And he was 
[00:29:00]  bitching about how my crepe around my egg omelet wasn't as fluffy as I would have liked it.  Yeah. And the strawberry, uh, wasn't that sweet. All right. She could have been, could  have been better. They have a new first class thing now. I don't know if all, I know  continental does. I don't know. A lot of airlines might be doing it where it's a non-refundable  ticket and it's not that expensive. It's not much more than coach. Oh really? Yes. That's  great. All right. Well, we have lots of show to do today. This is just kind of our, our little  warmup, I guess. Um, yeah, well we gotta, we gotta get the updates on the, the porn 
[00:29:30]  awards and all that. Right. And we also have Kenny talking to the porn girls, Ashley Simpson  being booed. We have the HBO dwarf special finally. Oh, some audio. Uh, some, some, some  actually there's not much going on in the newspapers today. Really? Nah. More, more info on the  Brad and Jen breakup. Oh, girls. Now you have your shot. Oh, I love the slobs that are like,  Oh God. Yeah. He's going to go to you. That's why he left that big titted wonder. So he can 
[00:30:00]  go to your fat ass. Unbelievable. Thank God. Why'd they break up? Does anybody know? Well,  because Brad Pitt was banging Angelina, uh, Angelina Jolie. Angelina Jolie. You gotta respect  that. That's exactly what he should have been doing. That's what I'm thinking. They're  started, they're kind of hinting. Those big chapped lips of hers. They're kind of, they're  kind of hinting at that. That he spent a lot of time with her when they were filming a movie  together. And supposedly Jennifer, uh, caught Brad having phone sex with Angelina. Is that  the story? Well, one of the papers is reporting that a bridge, uh, British tabloid swears. 
[00:30:30]  That's what happened. They don't have any kids, right? No, that was the big problem. Yeah.  Because, uh, he wanted to become a father. Believe it or not, he wanted to be the father,  uh, become a father. And Jennifer didn't want to have any kids. And he was saying he was,  he fell in love with Angelina Jolie's a three year old, right? Max. Yeah. So, so that must've,  what a, what a slap in the face. Isn't that, isn't that her kid with Billy Bob Thornton or  no? Yeah, I think so, right? No, no, no, no, no. No? You guys are all over the ball field.  Three years old and it's not Billy Bob Thornton's kid? Well, I think they adopted the kid when 
[00:31:00]  they were together. Oh. All right. Well, okay. I was right then. Is it a little, uh, little  Asian child? Yeah, a little chinky. That's what they, they love bringing him over from like  Korea. I think you missed the button on that one. No, the little, there you go. A little  chinky? A little chinky, yeah. A little, little, uh, Asian fella.  Hollywood loves that. They get little Asian or black kids or something like that. Anything  but white. You don't want to walk around. It's not trendy. It doesn't make people look  at you and go, you're such a great humanitarian. That's not true either. Stop it. It's just 
[00:31:30]  hard to get a white kid. It is not. Rosie O'Donnell got a couple. It's very hard to adopt a white  kid. They're in demand because they're lovely children. Very tussleable. Rosie O'Donnell got  like two or three or whatever. She had this special inside connections, I guess. I guess  something was going on there. I think they do it though. Believe me, a celebrity, they'd  find the white kid. Yeah. They do it to look like, so people look and go, ooh, it makes  news. It makes news more than it does for, uh, they love photographing them with their 
[00:32:00]  little kids of mixed ethnic backgrounds. With their little chinky? Yeah. They, uh, I think  one reason they should do it at least is because it doesn't wreck the body. You know what I mean?  Because Angelina Jolie doesn't want her body wracked by a pregnancy and her tits falling  and her stomach all messed up. True. Because then whatever celebrity you're sleeping with  is just going to go out and bank someone who's 19. There you go. So they probably figure  let's adopt and keep the body right. I like it. Very good. I think you're right.  Enough kids in the world. Stop pumping them out, stupid asses. Pick up a few Chinese or 
[00:32:30]  wherever else they are. Seriously, there's a billion kids that need to be adopted. Just grab  one. Just grab one. Grab one off the streets. All right. Nice Swedish boy in Thailand.  And if you happen to float by, you just grab them. Wash stuff on a beach. You're mine, son.  All right. We're going to take a little break here and we'll continue with, uh, the Opie  and Anthony program. Lots to get to.  They replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know, like the, the, the, they're  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, well, I don't even know why they're, I don't, I said, I said, this 
[00:33:00]  doesn't. They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony. I don't, yeah, I mean, yeah,  I go, well, I don't care. They think I give a clap. I don't care. Why would, why would  I care? I don't care. I said, I said, this doesn't. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, well, I  don't care. Say I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I  don't care. I don't even know why you're involved with me like this. I don't care. 
[00:33:30]  He just doesn't care, Anthony.  It's time to find America. Let's hear it for Pennsylvania.  Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, look at that. Oh, this is a hard baby.

[00:37:00]  Searching, seek and destroy.  Okay, terrific.  Searching, seek and destroy.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out with that.  Where's the rest of the gang today, man?  Everyone's hanging low.  Oh, yeah.  Martini Steve and the Herky Jerky Man. 
[00:37:30]  I see the only one that seems well-rested and ready to go today.  He's an eager beaver.  Eager beaver.  Is our own Eric over there who couldn't go to Vegas.  Stayed here in New York and got a lot of work done, which we greatly appreciate.  We could have used him in Vegas, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, getting all his audio drops and stuff.  It would have been great.  It would have been great.  Well, we had Club Soda Kenny doing some stuff at the porn convention.  I don't even know how that show sounded. 
[00:38:00]  Did anyone get to hear it?  Saturday show?  Oh, man.  Dirty.  Well, obviously dirty, but just a mess.  Just a two-hour cluster F.  Yeah.  It was a constant, you know, parade of smut.  I remember when we started the show, and before we knew it, it was over.  And we were like, what the hell?  Did we get anything done?  I think so.  It was like just a constant barrage of sluts and faggots coming up and, you know, hawking  their wares, pretty much.  Some of them being brutally honest, and some of them had nothing. 
[00:38:30]  We didn't have any faggots coming up?  I don't think so, I don't know.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, because the guy with the top hat and the tits, he wasn't a faggot.  Oh, Josie.  That guy was the faggot of faggot faggot.  Yeah, he was.  Do we have any video of our time at the convention?  See, you've got a lot.  It's probably going to take a couple days to get it up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com,  but I forgot about Josie with the 38 double D breast implants.  You don't think the guy spray-painted as a leopard? 
[00:39:00]  He was banging chicks, though.  No, he's like, yeah, he works with a black mirror.  Yeah, porn star doesn't mean you're not a...  He was just a spray-painter like that to get some attention, I guess.  Yeah, he does straight-point.  He works for that guy, Joe Galan, who brought us candy and the other girl.  Everyone was just trying to get attention there.  You notice that?  It was, I don't know.  Oh, and they're all, like, into their businesses now.  I have a business, and then they give the name and the website and stuff, and, you know,  they sell smut.  It was definitely fun.  It was definitely a good time.  My new friend Tom Byron, I think, had a good time. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, your new friend Tom Byron.  Why, did you do a threesome with him, too?  No, I would love to have, but no.  Yeah, that guy's a legend.  You see your old pal Ron Jeremy?  Yeah, I saw him briefly when I was actually walking out of the convention.  We said hello, and I talked to him for a minute, but he was signing.  I didn't see him that night.  The line of people waiting to get into that place when we were done with our show,  it stretched the entire length of the Venetian, which is huge.  Huge, and just a line of perverts. 
[00:40:00]  Safe to say the line was at least a quarter mile long, and it was at least five people wide.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable how many people were going in there.  They're drinking beer online.  They're all getting revved up to go in there and just, I don't know what.  Well, I went upstairs, had lunch at the Venetian there, and it was just funny because porn people  were walking all over that hotel, and I saw this one girl leaving the bathroom area.  She looked like she just didn't, I don't know who got her into the business, but she looked 
[00:40:30]  like she just didn't want to be doing it.  It looked like it was her really short boyfriend who was waiting for her to get out of the bathroom.  Yeah.  And she was dressed up like a complete slut in an awful, I mean, in an awful way.  She just didn't look the part at all.  Her makeup wasn't right, and it was runny.  She just had a little too much skank going on, and she's holding a drill, though.  Really?  She's holding a drill without the dildos on it, but you could tell because it was pink  and stuff.  So I guess that was her thing that she does in the porn industry. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, snap on attachments, and then she just lets it rock.  And her boyfriend's like, all right, come on, let's go downstairs, all barely enthusiastic.  And then I noticed he's got the bag of dildos for the drill, and they're heading downstairs,  boyfriend and girlfriend, to have a nice day together.  It was just, I don't know, it was weird.  The whole thing was weird.  It was weird.  Like, I know Jimmy and Steve weren't leaving the place.  It was like eight-year-olds at Disney. 
[00:41:30]  They just would not leave this place.  And I don't know, it was kind of weird.  I mean, it was cool to walk around and see the, you know, the smut they were showing  on the video screens and stuff, but all the chicks are just kind of ravaged.  They're just this side of hot, maybe.  Like, there's a few hot ones, but they're just like, ugh, just run through the mill, kind  of.  But you know what takes away from the hotness when you start talking to the girl? 
[00:42:00]  And who was the girl that set the anal record?  She had, like, an anal gangbang.  Yeah, 101, was it?  I think it was 101.  It was a lot.  101 big ones in the old poop shoot.  Over 100.  Does it matter what the other number is?  Does it matter after two?  Yeah.  A hundred up the ass.  Up the ass.  And you're like, well, that kind of takes away from your hotness, I'm sorry to say.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's what they do, though.  And then you walk around, and that's what I didn't get.  As you walk around, it's not like you can buy anything.  You can't buy anything at these trade shows. 
[00:42:30]  You just kind of look around.  So it's not like a big flea market.  So what do you actually do?  I didn't get it.  You kind of walk around, you pick up little pamphlets, you look at, you know, ooh, there's  the real doll.  Here's the, you know, Vivid's display.  And, you know, I kind of didn't get it.  It's like any other convention, though.  You meet people, you get your picture taken.  A lot of guys want to get their picture taken with the hot chicks.  That's what I figured.  Yeah, they were just coming there.  But, I mean, a quarter mile of people. 
[00:43:00]  That's what skewed me out enough that I just needed to go, was not the actual, you know,  the porn stars.  Because, like Anne said, you know, there were a bunch of them that were definitely hot and  stuff.  And you had some skanky ones, whatever.  But it was the people that were coming in really, really bothered me.  They all looked like pedophiles or something.  There was a look in their eyes that just wasn't right.  Yeah.  I'm sorry to say, Jimmy, it just wasn't right.  Sorry to say, 90% of them probably have wow stickers.  Who do you think the fans of this program are? 
[00:43:30]  It's everyone on that line.  I don't know, man.  I saw, maybe.  Maybe.  $10 billion a year.  No, I understand it's a massive industry, but I don't know.  How good did an R.E.  You had the old guys walking around with their pants just a little too high.  There was just something not right with a lot of these people.  Some of those weird old guys with like bow ties, like a guy in a suit with a bow tie  and big thick glasses walking around just picking up every little pamphlet, looking around at  the scantily clad girls. 
[00:44:00]  Just a little frightening.  Yeah, there's some real creeps.  But Anari Vox looked very, very sexy, and I couldn't believe when Steve brought her over  and she's rubbing her ass on my leg.  That was like a dream come true.  I guess the hottest one, I don't know, that blonde was kind of nice.  Which blonde?  She showed up at the table.  I can't even remember her name.  Which blonde?  There was like four or five of them.  I'm trying to think of what she did, though.  She was really hot looking.  Yeah.  No, there were a few that were really hot.  But then you looked at a few of them, you could just see it in their eyes.  They're just like...  Some are beaten up.  Oh, yeah.  Way beaten up. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  They're just like, wow.  What was that chick that didn't want to talk about that other...  I think that was Tiffany Minx who didn't want to talk about Max Hardcore.  Yeah.  I know it was Max Hardcore that they didn't want to talk about.  Isn't that something?  A lot of girls don't like him.  Yeah.  She didn't want to talk about it.  She's in the porn industry.  Yeah, but it was the first time she did anal or something, so I guess she was new and she  couldn't really pick her spots, you know?  And I guess she had a horrendous experience with this guy.  Well, Max is scary, man.  And a lot of them do not like Max because he is really rough on them.  Max, I told you, gets a speculum and he holds her mouth open now and he's like urinating 
[00:45:00]  in their mouth.  Like, that's where he's gone to, Max.  But he's actually...  Again, he's done a lot for porn.  Oh, nice guy.  Maybe not a nice guy, but he really did tap into what men want.  As awful as he is, there's a side of what he does that really taps into men.  You know, I don't know how much of this stuff is really tapping into what men want.  I think it's pretty niche, but there's enough people out there that do want to see it.  But it's not like...  I don't think the majority of men want to really sit down and watch that.  Not that, no.  But there's a huge amount of people.  That's why the porn industry is so huge and so much money is being spent on it because 
[00:45:30]  there's so many little niches and every single one of them, there's somebody that'll do it  and fill it.  Well, I'm thinking more about like when he started, he was doing cherry poppers, which  is where he would take girls and pretend they're young and he would, you know, be like Uncle  Max and come over in a creepy little hat and awful little brown shoes and nothing else  and go like, let me show you how to make you popular with the boys.  He has like a really Midwestern accent.  Yeah.  And then he would just choke them with his penis.  And they were like...  You know, and tears coming down, makeup running. 
[00:46:00]  Oh my God.  And they would pretend that they were like, you know, young girls.  And as awful as that was, you know what?  It was a monstrous hit.  I guess.  Because he tapped into that awful thing men do when we look at Catholic school chicks.  He tapped into it.  He was honest about it.  Do you want to choke them like that?  No, no.  But, you know, again, it's, you know, they're porn girls.  So is he still working in the business?  Oh my God, yeah.  He's one of the biggest.  I don't know.  He's a Hall of Famer.  Max Hall of Famer.  Hall of Famer?  Is there a porn Hall of Fame?  Yes, there is.  Absolutely.  At Max Hardcore.  There's too many Halls of Fame.  There really are.  Well, I got more respect for this one than I do the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[00:46:30]  Maybe porn will put Sabbath in their Hall of Fame.  Yeah, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was...  Stinks.  So...  Stinks.  That thing is so overrated.  It really is.  Let's go into all these dead rock stars as addicts and grab some crap and put it on display.  Hendrix...  It's pretty much Hard Rock Cafe without the burgers, right?  Yeah, I would say so.  It's like, oh, Hendrix wore this once on stage back.  It's not even like a special costume.  It was like some...  You know, he wore it when he... 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  It was in Detroit once.  You know what I mean?  Great.  Something stupid.  Care.  Yeah, I hated the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when we were in Cleveland.  I wouldn't go.  Maybe the Pornhub Hall of Fame.  Where is that, Jimmy?  Do you know?  I don't know if it actually exists at a place.  It's just...  I don't even know if it's a place.  Oh, really?  You think they just induct people into this imaginary place?  I think it just exists in their minds, Anthony.  In the minds and hard-ons of...  Of many.  I had a wonderful time.  So, Club Soda Kenny, he really helped us out while we were out in Las Vegas. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have a feeling that the XM people really just don't like Kenny at all, which is a shame  because they just don't know what he's about yet.  I think everyone just got off on the wrong foot.  Yeah, well...  Kenny and XM.  XM, for us, and the Vegas trip, things weren't done quickly enough and soon enough.  And, you know, there were some cluster Fs with travel arrangements.  And Kenny is a guy who's very meticulous when it comes to taking care of his people.  So, you know, it's natural they would butt heads like that. 
[00:48:00]  But he's the only guy I would want on the road with us.  Right.  I mean, this guy takes care of the show.  Takes care of everything.  Yeah, he takes care of everybody involved with the show to the point where you can't, you know, you can't believe it.  It's everything from your coffee being there in the morning to your flight arrangements being taken care of, you know?  Transportation to the airport.  Yeah.  He's right there calling you with a wake-up call in the morning.  It's great.  He knows what he's doing.  He absolutely does. 
[00:48:30]  He knows what he's doing.  Yep.  And as much as he's a goofball sometimes, he'll do, like, do silly things like send the emails because he knows it makes us laugh.  I mean, he's got to get things done, but he knows we laugh at it.  See, I don't think they understand that he's not retarded.  He's doing it.  Part of that.  Do they not understand the goof in him doing it to make us laugh?  Right.  Some of it's really for real, like, let's get this done.  But then, you know, the long, I look forward to your anticipated cooperation.  That's just to make us laugh.  I know, but they look at it and they listen to him talk and they think he's retarded. 
[00:49:00]  And why do we want to retard running our show when we're on the road?  But he's not.  But the guy knows his stuff when it comes to this.  Yeah, he really does.  But they just hear, you know, hey, how are you?  You know, they hear an idiot.  I didn't even think of that.  You're actually right.  I mean, I probably wouldn't.  If I was working for a major corporation, wouldn't want to trust flight plans to that adultish voice.  You don't want that big idiot taking care of business.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But he's deceptive because he's really, he gets everything done. 
[00:49:30]  Everything.  I hear that one of their biggest problems in one of the meetings that me and Opie had to sit through.  We had to sit through an ELO meeting just because of Kenny.  And one of the things they were upset with was the fact that he called up the MGM Grand and wanted to speak to the CEO.  The CEO or the president of the MGM Grand to get us room.  To find out what the problem was with getting Opie and Anthony in their rooms.  I demand to speak to the CEO.  I think he wanted the rooms blocked a certain way for security reasons.  What Kenny will do is, and he had to do it with dice, but now it's a bigger scale because there's more people. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  Get all the rooms blocked within one or two floors very close together just in case there's a problem.  He's right there.  Right.  That's the main reason he likes to do that.  That's what he likes.  And he's always running around from room to room, you know, helping you out.  You know, he's the one that does the wake-up calls.  I mean, he does everything.  It's awesome.  Everything.  And who cares if he got thrown out of the CES?  Who cares?  Who cares?  It doesn't matter.  It really doesn't.  They didn't understand that.  Again, they just saw a big dolt yelling at somebody. 
[00:50:30]  You know, they didn't see the humor in it at all.  And they, I don't think they understand Kenny.  Yeah, I got yelled at by the CEO of XM Satellite Radio.  You certainly did.  Hugo.  Look, I don't want that big and stupid guy Kenny here at all.  No.  He's not to be here.  Kicked out of an electronic trade event.  Even though the reason he was kicked out of CES was my fault.  Completely.  Completely my fault.  No surprises there. 
[00:51:00]  I had a little idea.  Seemed like about, I don't know, two to three hundred people really enjoyed it.  But, eh.  The XM people were not happy with me.  We're very much looking forward to the following year and the company.  Shut up!  Yeah.  The company is growing by leaps and bounds.  Louder! 
[00:51:30]  Shut up!  Can't hear you back here!  Shut up!  We're looking into streaming video.  Boy!  Shut up!  Shut up!  This will be known as the second thing that we're not allowed to mention.  The guy ever again on the O.P. and Anthony program.  That audio won't, hopefully, somebody might be able to send in some audio from that and 
[00:52:00]  have it pop up somewhere.  I have no idea where that audio is.  That guy.  I believe it was destroyed.  Has the biggest set of balls I've ever seen, by the way.  Ever.  I've never seen anyone with a larger set of nuts than Kenny.  He will do anything.  Frightening.  Yeah, I think they did it for the wrong foot, though.  They just don't see the value of club soda.  They don't understand him.  Well, he was back in the game when we went to the porn convention.  We really needed him there, obviously.  And he walked around and he interviewed all sorts of porn chicks and stuff with Steve. 
[00:52:30]  What are you doing there?  Steve was just in heaven, also.  Okay.  I don't know where...  I've never seen Steve so excited, so giddy, to be in an event.  How great was he, though, man?  Steve brought everybody over that we needed.  He was fantastic.  All of a sudden, you show up with somebody new.  He was great.  I know.  Rapid fire.  Hey, by the way, what happened with you and Gene Simmons?  Oh, that asshole.  All I know is I was getting phone calls all night long from you, Ben, Steve.  Ben laughing his ass off. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  That's surprising.  Gene.  What?  Gene blew him off.  What happened?  Gene Simmons.  You just had him on the show, what, a week ago?  Two weeks ago?  I'm in a bathroom.  All right, granted, that's a little bit creepy.  I'm in a bathroom and I see him and he walks in the men's room at the Venetian.  So he walks by.  I go, hey, Gene.  And he goes, hello.  And of course, he doesn't look.  He just keeps going straight.  Again, he's a rock star.  I don't blame him.  I wouldn't look at me either in the men's room.  I decide to wait outside, say hello real quick.  And the security notices me kind of lurking there with Steve. 
[00:53:30]  So Gene walks out and I'm like, hey, man, you know, I'm on the Opie and Anthony show.  You just called in last week.  And he's like, all right.  He just won't even look.  He just walks right by.  Wow.  Steve, were you there when he got blown off by Gene Simmons?  Yeah, we both did.  We both got totally, totally blown off in a really condescension.  I forgot.  Yes, you did.  Oops.  It was just, he's, like Jimmy said, he's walking into the bathroom. 
[00:54:00]  I was the first one out.  I said, oh, hey, Gene Simmons.  He said, oh, hi, how you doing?  And as Jimmy came out, we waited.  We were going to talk to him.  And it was just so goddamn dismissive and condescending.  And we totally explained who we were, exactly who we were, mentioned the fact that he was  on the show.  We just wanted to talk to him.  And he just, and his response was, that's nice.  Nice for you.  I have to go.  And he goes, and then he had to leave.  And he goes, oh, Opie and Anthony, I might see those guys later.  And I'm like, all right, can I just get a quick picture with you?  He's like, no, I'm really running late.  He goes, you can walk with me if you want. 
[00:54:30]  So I start walking with him to get the picture.  And then Yoshi is just backing up and like trying to take, all he had to do was stop  for one second.  And he wouldn't stop or look at me.  So fuck you, Gene.  Oh, hey, relax.  Oh, that really annoyed me.  That really annoyed me.  He was one of your heroes growing up.  He was one of my heroes growing up.  When you were Jimmy Robbins.  Sorry, I wasn't hawking a kiss keychain, motherfucker.  It wasn't just a setup to maybe coddle you a little later.  Oh, did he annoy me?  Every bit of loyalty I had for him went out the window and I wanted to spit on him. 
[00:55:00]  I was so aggravated.  Wow.  How many bad people bashed him, called in, trashing him, and like an asshole, I defended him.  You did.  Time and time again.  And he doesn't need me to defend him.  He's a billionaire.  It's not going to change.  But it just really, really annoys me.  Look, I'm not anywhere near that level of fame, but I've taken enough fan pictures to  know that you can stop for one second.  A second.  Disinterested shithead.  Wow.  Wow.  Six foot three in your dark Undertaker suit. 
[00:55:30]  That stupid straight ahead look on your face.  We get it.  You're a genius.  We get it.  You have really turned.  I can't tell you.  That's a lousy picture.  I am so tired.  Yeah, but you know what?  It was.  Steve was right.  I understood he was busy and he had to leave.  I didn't expect a 40 minute photo shoot.  But he knew that we were talking about being on the show and we're members of the show and  he could have just stopped for one second and taken that picture.  That's it.  He didn't give a shit.  Right.  Sorry, I didn't have anything to sell for you. 
[00:56:00]  That's what it was.  It wasn't advantageous to him to stop for a second.  There was nothing in it for him, for him to stop, Jimmy.  God, that made me sick to my stomach.  And De Niro, your last three movies have sucked dick.  Yeah.  Anyone who didn't take pictures with me.  Over 200 million dollars.  Nah, I'm not talking about this.  I'm not talking about this.  I'm not talking about the fuckers.  Just the other stuff he's done.  Has stunk.  Just goes to show you more sheep in this country.  But have you seen the movie?  Just get online.  I've seen the ads.  I've seen the trailers. 
[00:56:30]  You've seen enough of the ads to know if the movie stinks?  Dude, I've seen Barbara Streisand.  I've seen, yes, I know it stinks.  I know it stinks.  They got the same jokes from the first movie.  Same gags.  How do you know?  You haven't really seen the movie.  Because I saw the trailer.  They put the good stuff in the trailer to try to get the people there.  And if that's the good stuff, please.  Third week in a row that I was number one at the box office.  Number one making hundreds of millions of dollars.  And it just looks ridiculous.  Barbara Streisand, stop it. 
[00:57:00]  Ugh.  I saw it.  It's more of the same jokes.  He's right.  It's the same movie.  All right.  The same stupid jokes.  And the people keep just flocking to that thing.  Speaking of Gene Simmons.  Well, we have the Kiss keychain.  We have the Kiss coffin.  We have the Kiss hat.  We get it, shithead.  Dude, but he was one of your heroes.  Dude, he was a childhood idol.  30 years I've been a fan.  This is all it takes to turn you?  No, no, no.  I've been turned out.  It wasn't that.  It was the attitude.  It was this smugness.  And it just made me sick. 
[00:57:30]  It made me sick.  And also my own nonsense has made me sick.  Too good.  My own defendingness asshole.  When people would call in and smash him on the air.  You feel like a used whore.  And again, he asked me to do nothing.  That's my own fault.  I'm not blaming him for that.  And I realize he's one of the biggest rock stars on the planet.  I don't expect a guy to stop and chit chat with every mope like myself.  If you're walking next to him and someone's in front of him with a camera.  And he told me you could walk with me.  And he knew I was from the Opie and Anthony show.  And he knew he had just called in and we had interviewed him. 
[00:58:00]  That's what the problem was.  Did he get a walking action shot?  No, Yoshi tried, but it wouldn't flash.  I finally said, Yoshi, I'm not going to beg him.  Fuck this.  And we stopped.  Wow.  And then the complaining began.  Oh, I can't tell you how aggravating that was.  He lamented about this for a good three, four hours after the film.  I was hot.  I was pissed off, man.  Really pissed off.  I'm really doing what?  What are you busy doing?  All right.  Certainly not creating a good record in the last 15 years.  What are you busy doing? 
[00:58:30]  Another rap video, perhaps?  Fire starter?  Fuck you.  Just because you didn't get a picture.  Dude, I can't tell you how much that aggravated me.  All right.  Maybe you can get me.  This is how annoying he is.  He has to go to Australia to find a room full of people who want to hear him babble for 30 minutes.  More about your philosophy on life.  Well, I think that you shouldn't get married.  That's easy to say if you're a bassist in a multi-billion dollar rock band, stupid.  Most people don't have those options.  True. 
[00:59:00]  God, I agree with him.  But he would defend all this if he got his picture.  That's what amazing is.  I know I'm a phony.  I know.  Thank you.  That's why I just attacked De Niro in his shit movies.  I'm tired of being nice to these celebrities.  I'm tired of it.  It kind of made me realize what a worm I am sometimes.  What a worm you are.  I know.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what is this audio you got in front of me here?  This is – now, is Vanity a friend of yours, Jim?  That's what I wasn't clear on.  Did you know Vanity from before?  Just from AVN I know Vanity, but I like Vanity.  Vanity is a transsexual that we met while we were at the AVN Expo, and apparently there 
[00:59:30]  was a story that we got from Joey Silvera, who we had lunch with, that Gene Simmons had  hit on Vanity, this transsexual, and there was a whole story that he tried to get Vanity  alone in his hotel room.  And so we got Vanity alone in a room and asked her, is it proper to call –  Yeah.  It's him.  It's got a –  No, it's a her.  If you see her, it's a her.  It's very – the most convincing transsexual I have ever seen in my life, except for the  penis.  Did you see the penis? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we got a whole – actually, we got video of how to tuck a penis back.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, she –  These guys were in heaven for three days.  That's all I got to tell you, man.  These guys are –  We got the whole visual on how a transsexual tucks the penis behind the legs, and it was  just an absurd video.  When is all this video going to start making its way up on the website?  I'll start cutting it up this afternoon.  All right.  Do you got video of our new gag, by the way?  Oh, the Jimmy thing?  Yeah.  All right, we got to get video of our new gag so people at home can understand it and 
[01:00:30]  play along when we do it from time to time.  And do you have any audio of Firestar?  Maybe we could put that on and all dance and cross over to another market.  Yeah, it's in the lead, Darrell.  All right, listen.  So, here's the story, I guess, that she told.  Yes.  It's Vanity?  Vanity.  This is Vanity, last year's Transsexual Performer of the Year at ABN.  Nominated, yeah.  Nominated again, and she should certainly win.  And what happened with you – and Gene Simmons blew me off today like a real asshole.  What happened with you and he last year?  So, I was walking with my ex-boyfriend and he asked me to go and, like, tap on his shoulder. 
[01:01:00]  And I was like, ah, I don't know if I want to do that because I don't like to impose on  anybody.  But I was like, okay, fine.  So, I went over there and I'm like, hey, what's up, Gene?  I'm a fan.  My name is Vanity.  And it's the trip because I just saw one of your films with the original Manatee, the  Prince, Vanity.  And he was like, oh, my God, yeah, I know her.  And I said, well, you know what, I'm transsexual, you know?  And he was like, what?  You're the fucking best transsexual I've ever seen. 
[01:01:30]  And he was like, no fucking way.  And he was with this girl.  I don't know if it's his wife or girlfriend.  And he was like, come back up to the hotel with us, to the room with us.  And I was like, yeah, you know?  And then my ex-boyfriend came up to him and he's like, hey, can I get a picture with  you and Vanity?  And he was like, get the fuck away from me, you know?  And I was like, that's my friend.  That's Doug.  That's my friend.  He's with me.  He's like, oh, I don't give a fuck.  I just want you here.  I don't want anybody else around here.  No fucking pictures. 
[01:02:00]  And then, like, I was like, okay, whatever.  I don't know if I want to hang out with this guy, you know?  And he's like, give me your number.  So I wrote it down and I was handing it to him.  And the girl or wife, whatever, she just, like, snatched it from my hand and took it  from me.  So I don't know what happened from there.  I guess she just didn't want him, you know, involved with me because I'm transsexual.  Because she was like, oh, my God, if people are getting this, you know, recording this,  then you can get in so much trouble, Gene. 
[01:02:30]  But, you know, he definitely wanted some.  That's for sure.  Wow.  That's for sure.  It just sounds like a guy trying to put on a girl voice.  I'm sorry.  You hear occasionally, occasionally, you get that yodel thing where it gets back into the  male voice.  Yeah, if you're just going on the audio, it does sound very masculine.  But, you know what?  Visually.  That audio?  That was like Mr. Edison's talking machine.  Was that recorded on?  It was recorded on a little, one of those. 
[01:03:00]  A foil disc?  Dictating machine.  What I did was incorporate this wax disc on this needle.  And what you do is you talk into this, I call it a microphone.  Jesus.  What the hell?  What kind of recording device is that?  That's because just before we flew to Vegas, I go, Steve, you got anything to record audio  on?  And he goes, uh, no.  I go, well, don't you think it would be a good idea?  So he went to Radio Shack and got this cheap little thing. 
[01:03:30]  It wasn't cheap, but it was the best one they had.  And it's one of those little digital dictating machines.  And it doesn't help that there's 8,000 people talking in the room around you when you're  doing this.  Mary had a little lamb.  His fleece was white as snow.  Oh, my goodness.  So there you go.  Oh, yeah.  That was the trans, uh, transsexual.  Very hot.  The point is, if I were wearing a dress, Gene would have been happy to invite me to his  room.  Is that clip kind of telling us that Gene's a, what, a cocksucker? 
[01:04:00]  Is that what it?  No, I don't know.  No, I don't say that at all.  No, I don't say that.  Is that what you're trying to say, Jimmy?  No.  Your hero?  He certainly acts like one.  He was your hero before he decided not to have a picture with you?  His cockiness really just sickened me.  And the listeners that were trashing him were right.  And I was wrong for defending him.  All right.  With that, we'll take a break and we'll continue.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back, way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois. 
[01:04:30]  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 Day Timer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  XM in your new car.  A complete Sky-Fi 2.  The Polk Home Tuner.

[01:07:00]  You didn't see when we were flying out?  There was snow in all those mountains around Vegas.  Yeah, on the mountains.  But there's always snow in the mountains.  Right.  Well, there's a lot of snow.  I was hearing on the news, a snow in Vegas.  This is amazing.  It's the first time.  I looked out my window.  Nothing.  No.  It was warm.  It was like 50, 55 every day we were there, right?  Yeah.  And then you got to hear from people, I heard it was snowing when you were in Vegas.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't snowing at all. 
[01:07:30]  It was kind of nice.  Maybe in northern Nevada they got some, I think.  Didn't they?  In northern Nevada?  Yeah, but that's snow.  Look, they're showing Reno covered in snow on the news.  Well, Reno's just getting dumped on this year.  That was the first time I spent any time in Vegas, really.  I was there for like 16 hours once when Stephen Lynch was on tour.  We did the road trip from L.A. to Vegas.  So I didn't really get to see a lot of Vegas that time.  What amazed me about Vegas is just how many freaking hookers there are.  Oh, yeah.  Wherever you look, wherever you go, doesn't matter what time of day. 
[01:08:00]  That's where they hang out.  That's where the money is.  You play spot the hookers.  Mm-hmm.  Some are very obvious.  They dress the party.  Others are very subtle.  You know, they're by themselves doing the video poker and stuff, just waiting for someone  to kind of saunter up to them and start a conversation.  Think that you're actually getting a girl and not a hooker.  And we had a wake-up call at, we all had to get up at what, 4, 4.30, whatever it was yesterday,  leave the hotel about 5.  And we were leaving the hotel with all the hookers. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  All the hookers.  And the security guys are now stopping the hookers.  Maybe Jim can help us out because he does prostitution for dummies here for us on the radio show.  All the hookers were leaving through the elevators that, you know, whatever.  And they were getting stopped by the security guards on the way out.  What's that about?  I don't know, to be honest.  I saw it when you did.  I'm guessing it's just, you know, they go through these little clean-up things once in a while  where they have to, they try to boot them out.  They know they're going to come back.  But you just can't have a hotel like the MGM or the Venetian being overrun by prostitutes. 
[01:09:00]  They try to keep it.  Overrun.  Yeah, well, that's what I mean.  Get the roaches out.  There was one morning, because I was on New York Times, I got up real early, went downstairs to get  Starbucks at, like, five in the morning.  And I'm telling you, I could not believe how many hookers were in the hotel at that hour.  Well, they know it's a bunch of guys with a little bit of cash on them.  And they talk in little groups because they're bored now, and they know it's the end of their night,  and they got nothing else going on.  So they're trying to figure out what to do next.  And then, like, the security guards would go over to one group of hookers to break them up 
[01:09:30]  and pretty much tell them to get the hell out.  And then there would be another group over here and another girl on her cell phone here.  I mean, it was just everywhere.  Yeah.  Absolutely everywhere.  That's Vegas.  I've never picked one up like that.  Never picked one up in a lobby.  I'm too scared they're a cop in it to set up.  I always get to where I have to call them on the phone and have them come up.  You wouldn't know where they're coming from, what they are.  Yeah, you don't know who's watching you do that.  I've had a couple I've talked to, but they always want way too much money.  Just the whole scene in the north.  So how do you get girls in Vegas?  I call them on the phone, or I usually call. 
[01:10:00]  Now with the internet, it's fantastic because you can go on and read reviews.  And yeah, go on and read reviews, man.  And I get the good ones.  And you have your computer with you everywhere.  Laptop?  Everywhere.  Plucked right in your room, and you punch them up.  Since my Dell desktop has been out of commission for probably two months now,  and they promised me a new one a month ago, and I still haven't gotten it.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, of course I'm using a laptop.  I hear Gene Simmons runs that company, Dell.  Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me.  Maybe I could, what's the word that you get?  Copyright the little money bag symbol. 
[01:10:30]  Just because he didn't take a picture.  No, not just because.  You can't turn on one of your heroes because he wouldn't give you a picture.  Yes, you can.  First of all, you would defend all this stuff, though.  I would defend it, but not the arrogance behind it,  and not knowing when we'd hawk the product for him when he called in a month ago,  and I wasn't asking to hang out and do an interview.  Dude, that's right.  We did hawk the product.  Do you honestly think that we're all friends?  That is business, though.  We do a radio show, we invite someone like Gene Simmons on to give us some good radio, 
[01:11:00]  and in return, he'll promote some crap.  That's what it is.  And when it comes down to it, as soon as these mics are off and he hangs up the phone,  he could care less about us, and quite frankly, we could care less about him.  Understandable, but is that really good radio, that stupid audio we played,  and him sitting in front of a room full of people who are just so happy to be in the room with him,  not really that the content is boring and tedious and pompous?  I think he's absolutely right.  I think Jimmy's right.  I am right.  It's sickening.  And again, his level of fame is in a stratosphere I'm never going to hit.  He gave us good radio that day with the apprentice girls. 
[01:11:30]  I know he did.  It was kind of fun.  Yeah, I know.  He's a pompous ass sitting there with his legs crossed.  Let's go to Iowa and say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy, what's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, little Jimmy.  Did you have fun out in Vegas?  I did with the exception of that last little incident, Jeremy,  but thanks for asking and welcome to the program.  Thank you.  I don't blame you.  How many hookers did you get with this weekend?  Two.  Two?  Yeah.  Were they nice?  You only had two girls come back to your room?  Yeah.  He was sick that one day.  I had one who was a friend just come back and we hung out and nothing happened. 
[01:12:00]  Wait, wait, what?  My female friend who lives in Vegas.  Is she a hooker?  No.  Oh.  I think nothing happened.  Okay.  If that was an option, I would have fished over a little cash.  I would have fished over a little cash.  Here comes Club Soda Candy.  Big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready.  Because here comes Club Soda Candy.  Thank you.  Louder.  Thank you. 
[01:12:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anyway, Club Soda Candy walked around the porn convention with, what, Steve?  Yeah.  And Jimmy a little bit too, right?  No, this was the first day was Kenny and myself walking around just going up to every  booth, tapping these girls on the shoulder as they're signing autographs for 150 people  in line and just pulling them out and getting like 90 seconds of audio of an interview.  Steve stayed until closing at the convention every day.  Yeah.  He would just go there and stay until they threw him out. 
[01:13:00]  Well, I had to talk to so many people because I've been corresponding with a lot of these  people for years.  And I never met them.  And there were so many.  And I would just bounce around and talk to them all.  And they were all just...  I'm sorry.  I've never done it.  The ex-singer of Kissinger says she is suing rocker Gene Simmons, VH1, for slander.  Does anyone know who that is?  Yeah, that's in the paper today, actually.  Yeah, I'll get the article.  And a big smile came on Jimmy's face.  Good, that ass.  Anyway, but yeah, I just had to meet all these guys. 
[01:13:30]  Like Brandon, I'd been talking to him for years.  I finally got a chance to meet him.  And it was cool.  He was a nice guy.  Unbelievable.  These guys were in heaven.  I know.  It was great.  Look at him.  He's still smiling.  I do love those.  They're nice.  Actually, most of them are really nice, too.  I went out to dinner with some of the legends.  You know, John Leslie, Silvera.  God, Paul Thomas was there.  We saw Gina Lynn.  We saw Joey Silver.  I'm spouting these names.  I know the Amber Lynn.  These are all most of them.  I know the Amber Lynn, sure.  Yeah, a lot of these people.  They're all really nice people.  I mean, they're pretty normal. 
[01:14:00]  I only know a couple of the girls' names.  But these guys, they know all the guys' names in the movies.  You've got to know Ron Jeremy, obviously.  Well, yeah.  He's like the benchmark.  We've got a picture with John's ex-wife.  Me and Yoshi did Laurie Hall.  And then that guy that we interviewed, I remember him.  The old school guy.  Tom Byron.  Oh, yeah.  Tom Byron.  He was in a lot of movies with Ron Jeremy, right?  Back in the day.  He's the Bank Tracy Lord.  Tom Byron, I recognized him.  He's, you know, older, but.  That was about it for us.  Yeah, that's it.  But these guys are like, oh, you know, this guy. 
[01:14:30]  They're blurting off these names like it's the Oscar list.  Well, the shelf life, let's be honest, of porn stars is not that long because obviously  the age, I mean, it's like some of them make, that's why I love Ron Jeremy.  The guy has made a career out of it.  And it's very rare that they can do that.  Yeah, but that's the goof factor, too.  More specifically, the porn chicks, the shelf life on the girls is so short.  Sometimes it's a year.  These guys have been in the business and maintaining, sustaining a business, whether  in front of the camera or behind the camera, for years.  So to finally, you know, meet some of these guys was actually pretty cool. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Ben's reminded me.  It was weird because there were six of us in Vegas and Kenny, obviously.  And Jimmy, Steve, and who was the third guy?  We were talking about how Eric wanted autographs from Steve of porn people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So.  Like, Ant and I and Ben could care less.  Yeah.  We went, we took a peek, it was cool.  Yeah.  You know, definitely cool, but all right, time to do something else in Vegas.  Exactly.  And then the other half of the staff just completely the opposite direction, couldn't get enough. 
[01:15:30]  Just could not get enough of the porn.  At the convention, at the awards show, they're hanging out, going to dinner with these people.  I mean, lunch.  I didn't, I don't know.  I just didn't really get it.  But when you hang with them, like, you know, like, Joey Silvera is a good friend of mine.  I say, we don't just talk about porn, we just hang.  I mean, he's like a regular dude that I know.  He's just a guy.  Yeah.  If you saw his face, you go, yeah, I know who he is.  Joey Silvera is going to go out and get satellite radio.  Well, yes.  As a result of us.  They're all, you know what it is most. 
[01:16:00]  And who's Joey?  Joey's another legend.  He's here.  Look how he just looked at you for a second.  Obi says, who's Joey?  And Steve put this face on, like, that's sacrilegious.  His face, you'd know.  You'd know his face.  You'd know.  All right.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Who's that?  You don't know.  I hope he didn't hook up his satellite radio already.  Who's Olivier?  What?  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  We got to go back to, we got to rewind a little bit here. 
[01:16:30]  Leighton the trucker.  What's up, Leighton?  I'm sure you guys are doing this morning.  But pretty good.  A little tired, but I think we're starting to wake up here.  Yeah.  I feel the same way.  Right on.  Anyway, I was just curious.  Jimmy, why were you a little afraid to pick up a prostitute in the MGM Grand when prostitution is legal?  It's not legal.  No, it's not.  Dude, it's legal in certain Clark County, Nevada, which is Vegas.  It's not legal at all.  They want to rest your ass for that.  A misconception of that. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, yeah.  They think prostitution is legal in Vegas.  It's not.  The closest place, I believe, is 63 miles.  It's one of the ranches, the chicken ranch, which I've never gone to.  The bunny ranch, my friend Dennis owns.  So that's the only one I would even consider going to.  Yeah.  From what I've been led to believe it was legal all over.  Shit.  Nope.  See?  My friends would have just mocked in there and just said, to hell with it.  I'll take you five.  And that probably gets a lot of guys in trouble.  They're a bit more tolerant of it there, I think, than other places.  They're a bit more tolerant.  But Steve just took out a picture that really is violating it. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Turn that over.  Wait.  Let me see that.  Jesus.  What is wrong here?  All right, Leighton.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's definitely not legal in Vegas where we were.  But, I mean, obviously, everyone kind of looks the other way.  Yeah.  For the most part.  As long as it doesn't become, you know, completely out of control in the hotel lobbies.  What are you looking at?  Oh.  What are you looking at?  There's a picture of him.  It's just an awful photo.  I don't know why that bothered me so much. 
[01:18:00]  What is this?  It was a flyer that was on one of the...  No, he's not talking about what the flyer is.  It's like, what is that guy thing?  There's a guy that looks...  It's a vagina.  He has, like, a clit and a vagina.  But is it a guy that...  He looks like a guy.  He doesn't look like someone transgendered from woman to guy.  He looks like a guy.  This guy looks like he's bald with, like, a handlebar mustache, lots of tattoos.  Picture the strong man in a circus.  This guy would kick your ass. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Big time.  He's the type of guy that would kick your ass.  And then you could have sex with him.  And he's in the woods here, and his pants are pulled down.  And, yeah, that's like a big clit is what it is.  Oh, that is awful.  What's his name?  Buck?  Is it?  Is that what the thing says?  Something Buck?  That was, hands down, the weirdest picture I saw there.  Yeah, it really is, Zach.  It scares me on some weird level.  Isn't that creepy?  Don't throw that.  That's not on the wall.  Eric then hands me a whole fistful of Anna Kornikova pictures to cleanse my palate. 
[01:19:00]  She was pulling down her bathing suit a little bit while she was on vacation, and what, the paparazzi got a picture of her snitch?  Yeah, she's trying to, like, get sand out of there, I guess.  What website is Anna's snatch on?  I don't know.  Eric said he emailed me the link, but it's not popping up on my email.  All right.  Well, I'm sure a lot of people out there want to see these latest shots of Anna Kornikova. 
[01:19:30]  Her body is a little masculine.  No, not at all, man.  Like, look at, dude, dude, not at all.  Stop.  You're getting picky.  Come here.  Once again, you're getting picky.  Look at that.  Look at the bottom half here.  Without looking at the top.  It's a little, like.  You're insane.  Look here.  Dude, you're insane.  No, I'm not saying.  Relax.  I'm not saying it's not hot.  You're insane.  I'm just saying.  What makes a manly?  Okay.  She's got no real hips to her.  She doesn't.  And she's got, like, the V thing going. 
[01:20:00]  A lot of women are doing the V thing with the abs now.  All I'm saying is her body is.  Jimmy.  A little.  Help me out here.  Yeah, I don't see it.  You're reaching, bro.  You're reaching.  I don't see anything masculine about it, but I, you know, she's muscled.  She's well muscled, but she's an athlete.  She's an athlete.  Yeah, she's an athlete.  She's a muscular gal.  She's got a little bit of a V going down there.  The V heading toward the vag.  It's very nice.  Very nice.  All right.  Eric's got the website for you. 
[01:20:30]  The dude hung up.  He got a hooker for $7.  He got $7.  Are you sure he wasn't playing on the old story I told where I got oral treats for $7 and two  cigarettes in Plainfield, New Jersey?  I don't know.  Or was it New Brunswick?  It was probably one of those two places.  So Steve got a whole pile of porn in front of us here.  This is all those samples he got from the convention?  Can I have that?  Because no one's paying attention here.  This is from, let me tell you where this is from.  Maybe people can find this photo.  It's called a Robert Hill Superstar from Robert Hill Releasing. 
[01:21:00]  And this guy's name is Buck.  Robert Hill Releasing.  I don't know who Buck is.  I don't know what he does.  So go to Robert Hill Releasing.  Maybe somebody can find this online.  Oh, I got a website.  It's just a freak.  www.roberthillreleasing.com  All right.  Very good.  All right.  So Steve got a sample of stuff from the porn convention.  You want to go through this fast?  Sure.  Let's go.  And then we can get back to the end of Kornikova. 
[01:21:30]  So we have, in front of us here, we have One Night in China.  We now have China's sex tape.  This is the latest craze out there.  Semi-famous looking.  Semi-famous people making sex tapes is all the rage these days.  Also, Anthony, we got the clown porn we were talking about.  Here's the clown porn video.  Oh, goody.  Or DVD, I should say.  Yes, it's people dressed as clowns having sex.  Is that hot?  I say no. 
[01:22:00]  I say this is nothing hot about this at all.  We're on the same page as far as that goes.  Oh, a back cover's got different pictures.  Clowns in general are creepy.  Yep.  And that's just deeply disturbing.  They've got the clown noses on and the big clown glasses and the clown makeup and wacky wigs.  And they're having lots and lots of sex.  The only hot clown sex was brought to you by John Wayne Gacy.  I was just trying to think I had to tie him into this whole thing.  And that DVD is starring who again?  It's on the front.  Holly Stevens, Jenna Brooks.  Oh, and featuring Fred the Wonder Chicken, which looks like a penis dressed up like a chicken. 
[01:22:30]  And their big slug line here is clowns fucking.  Yeah.  That's it.  All right.  Well, we also got a bunch of copies of One Night in Paris.  Paris Hilton's sex tape.  Paris' sex tape.  I've never seen that.  Yeah, you've got to check it out.  In the paper today, it's saying another Paris Solomon tape ready to go.  Yeah.  Will it be this year's big seller?  Paris Hilton was last night braced for the release of a second video of her sex romps. 
[01:23:00]  Sleazy ex-lover Rick Solomon plans a sequel to the tape that made him millions.  The gambling tycoon boasts he has more red-hot footage.  A source revealed he is telling friends he has another Paris porn tape ready to go.  So we're going to see more of Paris Hilton, Anthony.  A second tape coming out.  Thank goodness.  And an insider said of the new clips, millions worldwide will want to see them.  Of course they will. 
[01:23:30]  These things sell like crazy.  We really are dumb.  It's amazing how a lot of people in porn are kind of blackballed from the mainstream industry.  Yeah.  And kind of booted out.  And they're good at it.  And this whore, this spoiled whore, just, you know, well, she just bangs a guy.  Yeah.  And we, we, this dummies in this country, which we are, make her a celebrity and is revolting to me.  Yeah.  She's not even great in bed.  No, it was pretty lousy.  If you watch the video.  She stinks.  If you watch the video, you never want a girl to go, ew, in the bedroom. 
[01:24:00]  If she's doing that, you're actually legally allowed to cave her head in with a shovel.  If she goes, ew, all right, that's, okay.  The network's giving her own show, though.  Yeah.  Give her, but say something racist on TV, slip and say something racist, and you're finishing  this business.  Yeah.  Speaking of all the reality shows, the paper has like a list of all the brand new ones  that are coming out.  Really?  Oh, it's ridiculous.  That's the new rage, too.  As Eric finds that, Anthony, then DVD, couples, fantasies, reality TV is, it's hottest and hardest. 
[01:24:30]  It's at a swingers club, and it's a bunch of real couples having sex, acting out their  intimate fantasies to win fabulous Caribbean vacations, and the grand prize worth $25,000.  You can win, too.  So they're trying to make some type of reality show porn?  Well, this is like, it's basically swingers having sex.  Yeah.  We were invited to some kind of swingers party.  Did anyone ever go and went?  We were too tired.  Me and Steve were actually going to check it out. 
[01:25:00]  We were both too tired after the AVN award.  Put your keys in the basket at the door.  And you pick them out, and whatever key you pick out is who you go home with.  Isn't that old school, like, swinger thing?  I don't know.  I've never seen a movie about it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, why?  No way to explain.  You kind of threw yourself out there.  I'm like, I'm thinking in my head, how the hell would you know the key trick?  No, no.  It was like in a movie.  The Big Chill.  What?  Was it The Big Chill?  Kevin Spacey and the lady from the West Wing. 
[01:25:30]  That was like one of those things that you just knew in, like, old school swinger thing.  That's how they did it.  I don't know.  Back when your big 70s Earth Mama Muffs were.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tommy.  Can I have that pile?  The rest of that pile, Jimmy?  Tommy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I was out there at AVN a couple of years ago.  I had a blast.  Cool.  I just wanted to make a comment on that, the clown thing.  Yeah.  I'm banging this broad, and I don't know if it's me. 
[01:26:00]  I might be the fucked up one, but she likes it when I wear the mask.  Just a clown mask.  Nothing else.  And I do her.  A clown mask.  Just a clown mask.  That's her fetish?  For you to throw on the clown mask?  Well, maybe his face just really bugs her.  Yeah, well, I kind of look like you, so it could be.  That's definitely a possibility.  Does she want you to put on a clown body, too?  No, I'm okay there.  And you do this, and it gets her off?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  That is weird, man.  And it's not just one of them evil clowns with the fangs and, like, they're real scary fuckers.  Really?  Yeah.  You think maybe she got, you know, touched a little?  It could be.  It's possible, maybe, the clown at the birthday party.  Little white gloves and underpants.  All right.  You know, it actually was my idea, and she went with it.  Yeah?  I found that if I could plug a website, I don't, you know, can I do that?  No, no, no. 
[01:27:00]  It was not my site.  I don't know.  That's okay, nah.  All right, Tommy.  All right, no, let him plug it.  That's too late.  I was going to have you hang up on.  I know.  Mike from Jersey, what's up?  Mike was just about to ask something that I was going to go into next.  He was wondering if the Mexicans were handing out the hooker trading cards.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  You walk the strip, and it's a bunch of Mexicans handing out these hooker.  They go like this.  Stand on the corner doing that?  Hand them out?  All in unison. 
[01:27:30]  There's like 10 of them in a row just all in rhythm like this trying to hand out these cards.  And if you want a chick, you just grab one and what?  Well, that's what I want to ask Jimmy about as Steve's distracting him.  No, no, no.  He's not.  He's showing me some of you.  All right.  What's up with the hooker cards in Vegas?  Just a bunch of guys, little Mexican fellas, stand around, and they slap them on their hands  when you walk by just so you hear them and look.  Right.  It sounds like.  But it's all these really hot girls.  Like, this was Jessica.  And she's giving away her body for $44. 
[01:28:00]  Stop.  Anyone that I would never.  She says, Jessica, $44 special, Anthony.  Here's $44.  That means she shows up for $44.  Yeah.  And then they're going to jack you on the rate.  They're going to want X amount for this, X amount for that.  It's a rip-off.  And it has the website.  It has a phone number.  And these things are hanging all over the chain link fences all over Vegas.  Yeah, that's the girl who's going to come over.  That's the girl right there.  Specializing in two-girl fantasies, one-on-one pleasures, and bachelor parties.  That's Jessica.  Pleasures.  And then there's Jenna.  Let's have champagne on me. 
[01:28:30]  Another $44 special.  $44.  Yeah, that's the chick who will show up.  Then you've got pink passion.  Oh, these girls don't show up?  These models?  And once in a while they do, but I doubt it.  Most of them are probably just snotty strippers who show up and want way too much money to  do nothing.  Latin passion.  Yuck.  But these cards are all over Vegas.  The Mexicans are giving them out.  They're on the chain link fences.  Girls direct to you in 15 minutes.  Fully licensed service?  What the hell is that?  Massage, probably.  Oh. 
[01:29:00]  Or entertain it.  Where they just stand there and they do this lame, unsexy dance until you throw more money  at them and then maybe they'll do something that's stink.  And that's $44.  She'll come over and what?  She'll do nothing but nothing for $44.  Nothing.  You're lucky to get a call from the lobby for $44.  Any idiot that's staying at the Pink Flamingo in Vegas and you think some hot chick is coming  over for $44, you deserve to be drugged and robbed and have your kidneys stolen because  you're stupid.  And then other stuff we collected at the porn convention, this is sweeping the whole porn 
[01:29:30]  industry is these come clean.  Come cleans.  Yeah.  These personal wipes after you have sex.  Seems people are just having sex and getting themselves all dirtied up.  Yep.  So now you need these personal cum wipes.  They're pleasure wipes and the cum clean brand.  But you can also take off.  Get it off after getting off.  I understand those are also good for removing stage makeup.  So you can get them at Kiss.com.  Has anyone opened one of these?  No, go ahead. 
[01:30:00]  Open one up.  What do they smell like?  Where's Steve?  Because he knows all this stuff.  Ooh.  He just handed me the...  Smells nice.  Does it?  Stock...  Well, it's vanilla, no?  That one?  It's all vanilla-y.  The stockroom catalog.  All this bondage stuff you could buy.  Ooh.  Smell, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Well, that is really nice, actually.  It's all vanilla.  What is this?  Nice to have you take a batch in the face.  You could just wipe your cheeks off with that.  I don't like the way you mean you're like you're talking to me. 
[01:30:30]  The collective you are.  Steve, smell it.  It's really good.  It smells like vanilla.  What's that?  Come clean, yeah.  Come clean.  It's like a scented baby wipe.  Steve, what the F is this catalog?  I didn't say it was an amazing invention.  I just...  What is this catalog?  That was one of the things we picked up as we were leaving the S&M bondage portion of  the Adult Expo.  It looks like it's a bunch of butt plugs and paddles and cat of nine tails and what's the  blackjacks?  I don't know if that's really a proper term. 
[01:31:00]  Well, I'm not sure.  But it's a...  There's some creepy things in here like the open wide gag.  Look at this open wide gag thing.  Don't get that whole thing either.  I gotta tell you.  And the O-ring gags.  That just...  It's an apparatus that forces your mouth to be completely open.  Can't close it.  It's like a half mask over your mouth.  Why do you need that?  Well...  They have the Marcellus Wallace mouth ball.  The inflatable butterfly gag.  What is that?  Somebody explain this. 
[01:31:30]  Okay, motherfucker.  Okay.  The guy that has the dildo on his mouth.  And I guess the girl then sits on it.  Chin dildo.  It's a chin dildo.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, the girl then straddles your head and uses that.  And...  Yeah, I don't get that.  And then I saw this, which is...  Never hot.  Which is really, really, really disturbing.  It's called the cocksucker's mirror.  Have you ever wanted to watch yourself suck cock up close?  Now you can with our cocksucker's mirror. 
[01:32:00]  This cock ring with a voyeuristic twist is an 8-inch oval plastic mirror with a 2-inch diameter glory hole at the bottom.  Put your partner's balls and cock through the hole and watch yourself do what you do best.  Oh, so you stick it through the back of the mirror and she goes to town and she's able to look at you through...  It's a mirror...  She can watch herself.  Yeah.  It's a mirror that basically lays on your lower abdomen.  There's a hole in it where you stick your thing through and then the mirror lays on your lower abdomen. 
[01:32:30]  Alright, who does the guy look like in this?  What on that?  Let me see.  Uh...  Oh, Jesus.  Look at the guy.  Maybe...  Let's see if Jimmy knows.  I know.  Who does that look like?  I don't know.  What's he...  We all got it.  You put it right through.  And she can watch herself.  It's hysterical.  It looks like Straylo.  Hey, can we have a couple of cock mirrors set?  Well, let me call.  I'll get back to you on that. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, that's hysterical.  Wow.  It really looks like Kevin Straylo.  Why is he in that catalog?  I actually called him Kevin Straylo and I meant it.  Straylo.  Let me see.  What else is in this stupid thing?  He's a handsome guy.  So, they got all sorts of crazy crap.  And mostly, I want...  What you were saying, SMM is actually...  Most of this is not hot.  I'm so not into the leather cuffs.  What are you doing?  For what?  Yeah, what are you going to do with that?  I'm all tied up now.  I don't want to be tied up.  I don't want to be whipped.  I don't want to be, like, degraded or submissive. 
[01:33:30]  I love when those goddamn dominatrix come on the show.  And they're like, all right, who's going to be the one?  And they come over.  It's like, all right, you.  I'm going to...  No, you're doing nothing with me.  Yeah, exactly.  You're doing nothing.  One of my most famous moments is making a dominatrix cry.  One of the best things I've ever seen.  She sent that phony away whining.  She came in all tough and beating up people that were in the studio for the Ron and Fez show. 
[01:34:00]  And I had a nice buzz on.  And I just laughed.  I looked at her.  I go, you look like Joey Ramone.  Joey Ramone.  And she just left in tears.  Just completely lost it.  She couldn't take it.  Yeah.  To me, domination is very subtle.  Like, it's not...  Like, there's a couple of women I've met in my life who could really own me like that.  Really?  Like, not...  Don't spank me.  I'm not a bad boy, stupid.  That doesn't...  Kneel, slave.  Ah, shut it.  That does nothing for me, you script-reading colored. 
[01:34:30]  Blam up.  Oh, boy.  Lucky me.  I found the strap-on dildo section, Anthony.  Oh, goody.  Um, one that you could just...  You could...  Why?  Oh, okay.  It's for...  Oh, this scared me for a second.  Uh, it's for lesbian sex.  And, uh, the girl is putting the strap-on dildo on her, like, between her knee and her upper thigh.  Oh, right.  And then the girl can straddle her leg and use the strap-on. 
[01:35:00]  And then there's one.  It's called the leather dildo strap.  And the description goes like this.  We are always looking for new ways to use a dildo, and this black leather strap really opens up the possibilities.  It's a simple belt with a two-inch detachable O-ring in the center.  Strap it anywhere, like your thigh or the bottom of your boot, and experience new flavors of penetration.  Bottom of your boot?  And then they got a girl on all fours, and then a guy with...  Oh, it's on his boot?  It's on the bottom of his boot. 
[01:35:30]  She's on all fours.  With his foot in her ass.  On the floor, and yeah.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Nice.  That's exactly what he's doing.  So.  You were saying give me the subtlety of, uh...  I don't remember.  No, you don't remember?  No, it was actually something about being dominated subtly.  Yeah.  All right.  Screw it.  All right.  Well, it just goes on and on.  Some of this stuff is deeply disturbing.  You might want to take a look at that, Ant.  I might.  Well, you might find something that I missed there. 
[01:36:00]  Trying to go through a lot of this other stuff we have.  And, you know, it sounds like a silly little thing, but most of the consumer S&M items that  you see at the stores and stuff, they look so chintzy and cheap.  You know?  Where do you get the real, like, manacles?  If you're into that kind of thing.  Probably adult shops sell it crap.  I kind of wish I was into it.  It seems like a relatively easy fetish to kind of satisfy me.  It must be nice to just be tied up and whipped and you're happy.  How great would that be? 
[01:36:30]  There's plenty of stuff out there.  A ball and chain.  There's these big triangular metal devices where the top of the triangle goes around your neck  and then your ankles are shackled to the other parts of the triangle.  I don't get it.  Swings.  And then that latex vacuum bed.  You ever seen that?  I saw that on HBO once.  Real sex on HBO.  That twisted sick show.  And you get in between two layers of latex. 
[01:37:00]  And they suck the air out of it.  They put a little snorkel in your mouth so you can breathe.  And you're completely immobilized.  Mummification?  Yeah, it's pretty much like mummification.  Here's a little picture of it, Jimmy.  Right up there in the corner.  And they suck the air out and you're just stuck there.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  And then the girl will, like, kick you in the nuts and you can't move to cover up your balls.  I just don't understand that fetish.  I don't get it either.  Guys want to be, they use it with saran wrap, which is the other way they would do it.  They use saran wrap. 
[01:37:30]  I'll just put it over their mouth and nose and end it.  They would do that.  The woman would put saran wrap all over your face and body and then put her ass on your face and smother you.  But it's like, I like to be smothered, but not where I can't breathe like that.  It does nothing for me.  I don't understand that suffocation fast.  You like being smothered in what?  Like ass?  Yeah, like an ass in your face.  To me, that's the only type of domination that sex is.  If a girl's holding, I wouldn't mind being tired if a girl kind of teased me, put it on my face, wouldn't let me.  Just like a little subtle tease.  You see, that can be really hot.  But as far as, you know, hurting me or kicking my bag, this is a hot one too. 
[01:38:00]  Who wants to be hurt?  Yeah, there's some good pictures in there.  All right.  Let me go to Dave.  You're handing me a tranny.  Let me go to Dave in Missouri.  Bastard.  What's up, Dave?  What's happening, fellas?  Hey.  Big one.  How's that, Tits?  Hi.  How are you, sweet face?  Thanks for letting me get on the program.  Oh, thanks for calling in.  We're happy to have you.  Yeah, talking about this bondage deal.  I'm not into the whips, the chains, and all that shit.  But when my wife's on top of me, if she wants me to blow, she can slap the shit out of me 
[01:38:30]  three or four times, and I'll blow instantly.  You like your face slapped?  Yes.  What?  I don't know why.  Maybe it's a getting stuck under the porch when I was a kid thing, and I should be funny.  I don't know.  Well, Mommy probably slapped you, right?  When you were a kid, your mom would slap you in the face.  Never.  No?  No.  All right.  Smacking.  I don't know what it is, but anyway, one more thing, and I'll let you guys go.  All right.  Click.  Oh.  Very nice.  I think you got us.  Yeah, you did get me on that one.  Us.  Oh, yeah.  We're all like, yes, and? 
[01:39:00]  Huh?  What?  Katie Couric is talking to an expert on why Jen and Brad broke up, everybody.  Oh, an expert.  An expert.  Thank you so much for your insight.  Do you need an expert to let the people know that Angelina Jolie's huge cans in Brad's  face might have been the reason?  Yeah.  Maybe Jennifer's a C?  Yeah.  That could be it?  Mm-hmm.  All right, well.  You ever have your mouth spit in, anybody?  Ugh. 
[01:39:30]  Dude, it's not.  Kissing is a saliva transfer.  It's not as well.  Yeah, you know, you can realize that, yeah, you're kissing.  It's pretty much doing the same thing, but there's just something once you break that seal  and just launch the liquid over.  So you've had girls spit in your mouth?  My friend was into this, and I always thought it was really gross.  This is even after I was into, like, other stuff.  But once in a while, if it's the right chemistry with a girl and she'll hold your mouth and  drip spit into it, it is so hot.  Drip or spit?  Drip.  Spit occasionally.  I'm not talking about when she has bronchitis. 
[01:40:00]  Just, you know what I mean?  Just a, you know, I don't want acid reflux spit into my mouth.  Oh, God.  Just like a sexy, you know, woman dripping spit into your mouth.  It's sexy, Lunger.  Yeah, exactly.  That's kind of gross.  Well, I've had heard of subs that like to eat the, like, one guy used to like his mistress  to blow her nose in his mouth.  Stop it.  Yeah, I read that.  I cannot feel.  Oh, God.  That just got me.  He was a full toilet.  That was what he'd do.  Full toilet?  Yeah, full toilet.  Which I just don't comprehend that, blowing your nose in someone's mouth.  But you're just talking. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude, you almost got me to puke.  I mean, first of all, I don't want any, I don't want to blow my nose in someone's mouth  because I don't want their breath on my nose for the rest of the day.  I don't want to be raising my lip and sniffing their breath.  But to open your mouth and have somebody put their nose in and go, like that, would be  disgusting.  Like a little hard cornflake hits the back of your throat.  Hey, stop it.  Greasy, thick nose snot.  That would be awful.  That is really disgusting.  But they love it.  Yeah.  You've had girls do that, that spit in your mouth? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Spit is, yeah, sure.  What do you do after that?  Do you go, swallowing?  Only certain women.  There's a couple of women that have been able to dominate me like that.  And it's subtle.  Don't tie me up.  You just hold my face.  It's a confidence.  They hold your cheeks?  Yeah, and just open your mouth.  And make you go, like, like, holding your cheeks like chubby baby.  Not like that.  No, no, no, no, no.  Just like, you know, just like a gentle, like.  So she can aim better.  Yeah, yeah.  Just holding your face.  Just dripping a nice lot of spit into your mouth. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, that can be so hot.  Jesus Christ, you're a twisted bastard.  But that's not that dirty.  It sounds dirty, but it's really not.  It's twisted.  It's a little odd.  It's a little off.  It is a little bit off center, but it's not, like, crazy.  It means something.  I think if anything that isn't just your direct genital contact that feels good because your body's wired that way.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, nipples, things like that. 
[01:42:00]  Anything above and beyond that comes from some wacky place in your head.  Fetish.  Yeah, it's the spitting in the mouth.  That's not, it's not touching any nerve endings in the body that are meant to be stimulated during sex.  It's touching something in your head that I think was created when you were a small boy.  Possibly.  If Helen used to spit in your mouth?  I don't know.  Helen may have.  Jimmy Robinson would never let his mouth get spit in.  Gene would have loved to take a picture with Jimmy Robinson. 
[01:42:30]  Come here, let me hold your cape.  Um, yeah, but then again, I mean, look, this might be an extreme example, but any type of good sex is in your head.  I mean, uh, let's, like, you know, if a guy forces himself on a girl, I mean, you still have the genital contact, but it's not sexy for her.  She's disgusted.  So, I mean, it's all mental to a certain degree, but fetish, I think, is taking non-sexual things and making them sexual.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what it is.  So the spit in the mouth thing would, that's not working.  Dude, it's such a small percentage of women I've met in my life that that would turn me on.  Most women I'd punch in the face if they wanted to do that. 
[01:43:00]  It wouldn't turn me on.  Yeah.  But there's a couple that have that sexual energy over me, and I love a woman who can own me like that, and it's so rare.  It's so rare.  All right, well.  You are an interesting study.  But you understand what I mean, though?  Like, when, don't you like a girl who can just own you with her sexuality?  Like, that is such a hot thing, and most of them can't.  A lot of hot girls can't because they just think they're hot, and they have to just lay back and get naked.  It's like, no, stupid, that doesn't do it.  Sorry.  You need to be, you need to be owned, yeah. 
[01:43:30]  It's a chemistry thing, man.  It's a mental, it's a chemistry thing.  You have that or you don't with a person.  You cannot manufacture that.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Ant, unfortunately.  And we've got lots of phones.  The phones are just ringing like crazy.  We've got Club Soda Kenny wants to say hi.  We have Danny from Jersey.  Stay there, Danny.  We'll get to you.  We'll get to pretty much everybody on the phones, hopefully.  We'll continue.  But we have a Stephen Lynch song.  It kind of goes with what we're doing here.  All right.  Check this out.  So Stephen Lynch is here, and you've got a song for Julie, the transvestite pre-sex-op mess. 
[01:44:00]  Mess.  Yeah, I dated somebody like that one.  Okay.  And hermaphrodite is the technical lingo.  Hermaphrodite.  Well, I had a personal experience with one.  You did?  Yeah, I wrote a little song about it.  Okay.  She's part girl.  She's part boy. 
[01:44:30]  She's got parts everyone can enjoy.  She's got more.  She's got less.  She's got her manhood tucked in her dress.  Yeah.  Is she a mister or is she a miss?  Does she stand up when she's taking a piss?  She's my little girl.  She's my little guy.  When I try to please her, I get poked in the eye. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  She wears lace and she wears flannel.  She watches football and the Lifetime Channel.  What's that bulge under her nightie?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite. 
[01:45:30]  Some things are white.  Some things are black.  Some girls wear makeup.  Mine shaves her back.  She is still beautiful.  She is still fine.  It's too bad her package is bigger than mine.  She looks like Cher, but she's built like Sonny.  She loves Brad Pitt and finds her three stooges funny. 
[01:46:00]  Who's that girl with the grip so mighty?  It's just my hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Hermaphrodite.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[01:46:30]  That was great.  Stephen Lynch, everyone.  This is Bernie Getz.  Man, you better give me a 20 or something.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.

[01:48:00]  The magic.  The Giants of the Phillies!  The Giants of the Phillies!  The passion is renewed this February as spring training opens for the 2005 season.  The hopes and dreams of 30 Major League teams are told on XM Satellite Radio like never before.  Get it!  He takes a shot at it!  Here it goes!  And he's out of here!  Hear every play, every team, from spring training to the World Series.  Hear your hometown team wherever you are.

[01:48:30]  It's radio to the power of X, all included as part of your basic monthly service plan.  Who wrote this script?  Obi and Anthony.  XM202.  Go and save yourself.  And take it out on me.  Go and save yourself.  And take it out on me.  Yeah.  All right, we're back. 
[01:49:00]  Hey.  We got lots going on.  We're checking out One Night in China.  It's up on our video.  It's deeply disturbing, this video of China.  Oh, they're just making out now.  If it gets crazy, we'll go back to that.  China and X-Pac.  And, you know, we're nuts.  We got the One Night in China video, and we got the One Night in Paris video. 
[01:49:30]  I've never seen the Paris video.  Why are we watching this mess?  We'll pop that in.  You did, Eric?  I guess it's...  I guess in a way it's smart, because we'll get better radio out of how awful this thing  is than the hot piece of ass Paris getting banged.  So, all right.  I'd rather watch China.  At least she earned her fame.  At least she did something that deserved being famous.  What, being a rich child?  China?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Paris Hilton being a rich child isn't a good enough reason to be famous? 
[01:50:00]  The only reason I'd want to see her having sex is she was crying through the whole thing  and unhappy.  That would be worth seeing.  Hold on one second.  Yes.  Looks like it's going to get interesting up here.  Danny from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, R1A?  Hey.  Hey, Fun Bag.  Hi, fella.  Listen, I'm going back a way back, and I might be wrong about this, but, Opie, didn't you  have a story about you punching some chick in the tits?  Oh, that was...  I'm trying to remember.  What the hell's his name?  I remember we had a story about some girl that liked to get punched in the boobs. 
[01:50:30]  That was that nut out in California.  Oh, Chuck Farnham.  Chuck Farnham.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah, Chuck Farnham had this girlfriend that liked to get punched really hard in the boobs.  And then she'd get off, like, the next morning, she'd look in the mirror in the bathroom and  look at her bruises on her breasts, and she'd get off on that.  Yeah, that was such a turn-on, and then she would have to masturbate, looking at the bruises  on her boobs at Chuck. 
[01:51:00]  And Chuck couldn't...  Remember Chuck goes, I couldn't punch hard enough?  Yeah, she was like, punch me in the breast.  And he kind of, you know, gave this little half-hearted punch, and she was getting pissed  at him, because he kept doing that.  She goes, no, punch me.  And he said he just wound up and clocked her so hard with a right hook right into the  side of her breast, and she loved it.  Chuck, who was this Chuck?  I remember this.  Chuck Farnham.  Chuck Farnham.  He's a sick F.  You would get along with him very nicely.  He, like, he collects things from serial killers.  Yeah, yeah, I do remember that.  A little pen pal.  Yeah, we haven't had him on the satellite radio show. 
[01:51:30]  We'll have to get him on soon.  Let's see if he's still alive.  Thank you, Danny.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Here he comes, everybody.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid.  Six-foot-five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready, because here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  Hey, Kenny.  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning.  You did a great job for us in Vegas, Kenny.  Thank you.  Excuse me, may I interrupt?  You did a great job.  Oh, thank you.  You, Anthony, my own little Jimmy, you guys are too terrific. 
[01:52:00]  Louder!  What happened?  Oh.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Boring.  See you later.  Yeah.  That was a good convention.  That earned you two days on the bench, huh?  Two-day suspension.  Two-day suspension.  And the only reason we were able to get him back in the game was because all the executives  of XM Satellite Radio went back to Washington.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Pretty much it.  Well, I want to go on record.  I said earlier that it was completely my idea.  I was standing on a chair, and I was bored to tears, and I just told Kenny to do something.  That's all.  Right.  Well, shit happens.  And then Kenny, like, stressing the rest of the time, like, I should have known better.  I'm like, no, Kenny, we told you to do it.  Kenny made a little scene.  It wasn't like you did it on your own.  No.  You know?  Right.  So, whatever.  Meanwhile, they C-block everything we try to do. 
[01:53:00]  They step in and C-block it.  Right.  The other people.  All right.  We just decided to have a little fun.  Well, that's the problem with radio.  It's filled with a bunch of people that just don't know how to have fun anymore.  A little fun.  This is the easiest job in America, and people take it way too seriously is what it comes  down to.  Well, I also got to say, you guys got to be commended for getting up early and doing the  radio show today after that grueling travel yesterday.  Oh, I know.  So, commend us.  We're doing a radio show right now?  Yes, you are, and you guys are terrific at it, if you haven't noticed. 
[01:53:30]  I thought I was dreaming.  Yeah.  I just realized that, yeah, we actually are in the studio today.  I'm just going to snooze after.  Oh, God.  It's China.  Hold on, Kenny.  On Xbox Crooked One.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We're looking at one night in China as you talk, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  You're watching the 50 pounds of porno I had to drag back from Las Vegas? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, you had to carry that through all the airports.  How many airports were we in yesterday?  Three, four?  I don't know.  I think we stopped in every state.  Yeah.  Pretty hot.  Wow.  Maybe we should have taken a train.  We might have got home faster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I got to thank you for a great trip.  I had a great time with you guys.  You guys are the best.  Nice form.  I can't believe I got to hang out with you guys like that.  All right, Kenny.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Nah, come on.  Who's better than you guys? 
[01:54:30]  No, it was great.  You.  I think Ben or Steve caught this, but Kenny, Karen, I mean, just a ton of bags through the  airport in Houston.  Yeah.  When we had our layover, and you know, you have the walk thing there.  It's not called an escalator, because escalators-  The people mover.  The people mover.  And I'm in front of Kenny by a good 10 or 15 feet, because I have absolutely no bags.  And Kenny has, like, just both hands completely filled with bags.  I mean, it was ridiculous how much this guy could carry, right? 
[01:55:00]  And I'm screaming at him the whole time in front of everybody, and everyone's horrified.  I'm like, hurry up.  Come on.  We're in a hurry.  Poor Kenny.  It was really funny.  Well, how about that one time I just raced you through the airport in a wheelchair?  Yeah, and I'm screaming, get me to Starbucks.  I need my coffee.  Kenny pushed you in a wheelchair?  Yeah, as soon as we got off the flight in Cleveland.  He had a little headache.  Oh, my God.  So I get out, and Kenny's waiting with the wheelchair.  I jump in.  I'm like, yeah, sounds good. 
[01:55:30]  And he's just whipping in and out of people, and I'm screaming at Kenny like a real, like  a paralyzed asshole.  Like, get me to Starbucks.  Hurry.  We had a lot of lamb.  What?  He should have fallen out on the floor and started yelling at him.  Get me back in my chair.  The best was when everyone was convinced that, you know, I did have a problem.  Then I just casually stood up at Starbucks and got my coffee.  Yeah.  Despicable.  Well, you do stuff on the road to, you know, to entertain yourself. 
[01:56:00]  Yes, Kenny?  Kenny, you take command of a blackjack table like nobody's business.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  I had a lot of fun.  Oh, the way you cheated cards is incredible.  Anthony's a counter.  Cheating?  Oh, that cocksucker had everything in the deck.  And he said, I ain't even started cheating yet.  No, we had a lot of fun.  Yeah, but you remember when Anthony was supposed to make a bet and he wouldn't make it?  I'm like, what are you saving up for, to be Jewish?  The best, though, was we're all at a blackjack table and Kenny's kind of standing behind us watching. 
[01:56:30]  And then we made Kenny, like, skip around the whole casino for the dealer because Sharon, the dealer, was pretty cool.  And then Kenny would notice when the coolers were in the area.  Yeah, look out, a cooler.  And every time one would sit down, exactly, guys, take your money and run.  The cooler's here.  And it would just be the nerdiest guy that wants to play his last 20 bucks, you know, or 40 bucks, whatever it was.  I know a cooler's supposed to be a guy that cools off your hot streak. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  But what is the psychology behind it?  Is it real?  I mean, obviously the casino's use these guys.  There are people that are just mushes that sit there and it just affects the whole table, whether it's just their aura or whether they're making bonehead moves that screw it for the whole table.  But they just bring the entire table down.  The casino will actually hire people to make terrible moves?  I don't know.  I don't know if they do that.  It's just the people that are walking around.  Some people are just born losers.  You know, we really should get a casino expert on the air because I think it would be really, really interesting radio. 
[01:57:30]  And then we can find out.  No, I know that.  We can find out the story behind the cooler.  The movie The Cooler is just, that is a terrific.  I've seen that one.  That's a terrific flick.  William H. Mason.  You really should rent that one in.  It's right down your alley, The Cooler.  I didn't like it.  And Alec Baldwin, I know you didn't like it.  I would love that movie.  I think Anthony would love it.  Alec Baldwin was great.  I hate him, but he was great in that movie.  I thought it was a chick flick disguised as a movie.  No, not at all.  Dude, it's right down your alley.  Rent it tonight.  The Cooler? 
[01:58:00]  All right.  With William H. Mason.  Yeah.  Right, right, right, right, right.  I thought it was a really, really good movie, man.  I don't know why I didn't like it.  There's a hot chick in it, too.  Oh.  Yeah, who's the chick in that?  Uh, uh, uh, whatever.  I don't know.  But after we just got back from Vegas, it would be a perfect rental tonight, Anthony.  The Cooler.  All righty.  Get the Cooler, and then give us your review tomorrow.  Very good.  A little homework assignment for you.  I got homework.  Chris wants to say how to Kenny really fast.  Kenny, stay in the line.  All right.  Hold on.  I have to do this, though. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, now we're set for Chris.  Chris?  What do you got for Kenny, Chris?  What's up, boys?  I do believe you guys are supposed to tell us why he almost got kicked out of both shows.  He got kicked out of one.  He didn't get kicked out of the porn award.  He got kicked out of the porn award.  No, I almost got kicked out of that one, too.  You did?  For what?  Oh, you didn't hear that story?  No.  Well, we know he got kicked out of the Consumer Electronics Show for the thing you did that  we're not supposed to talk about right now, but you know us.  We'll blow that eventually.  This is how I almost got kicked out of the porno show, and you know you've got to be pretty 
[01:59:00]  low to get kicked out of the porno show.  Very low indeed, yes.  Me and Steve are doing interviews, which I believe you got on tape, and you can play  like, you know, whenever you get around to it.  We're going to play soon, yeah.  Savannah Sampson, she's like a really hot chick who thinks she's like all that.  Okay.  All that.  So like I'm interviewing her with like cute little questions, so one of my brilliant questions  was, what'd you have to eat today?  And she's telling me like real sweet, like I had egg whites and whole wheat toast and orange 
[01:59:30]  juice, and my follow-up question was, did it come out yet?  And there we just had the look of the disgust and the shake of her head, and she just walked  away from me.  And then like her manager came up to me and told me what a jerk-off I was and what kind  of questions am I asking, and you know, I had to tell him I asked every chick the same  question.  She's the only one to get offended.  What do they care if you're asking stupid questions?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  They're in porno.  Well, we got the audio.  Let's listen to it really fast here.  I'm at the Vivid booth with a lovely lady.  Will you introduce yourself, please?  I'm Savannah Sampson.  And I must say you are stunning.  What's your favorite fetish?  Um, my favorite fetish, I guess, uh, being tied up and, uh, I don't know, ravish.  Any urination involved?  No, but I did that one time in the shower.  I beat on somebody, and he beat on me, and it was kind of interesting. 
[02:00:30]  Okay.  How about some fecal matter?  What?  Hot and steamy on the chest?  No.  No.  You don't like that?  No.  All right.  How about helmet head or anteater?  What?  Helmet head or anteater?  Anteater?  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  Circumcised or uncircumcised?  Uh, uncircumcised.  Okay.  What did you eat today?  Um, I had scrambled eggs.  Egg whites, I should say.  Good.  Whole wheat toast, and cottage cheese. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Did it come out yet?  I don't like this interview.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  You hear?  I don't like this interview.  Yeah.  Therapy.  You know something?  They go to these goddamn...  They take cocks up the ass.  Relax.  They go to these events, these conventions and the awards, and they actually start thinking  in their little minds that it's a mainstream, legitimate business that they can be offended  if they're asked questions like this. 
[02:01:30]  You're in pornography.  Pornography.  It's pornography.  You're not in feature films.  You're not a celebrity that walks down the street that everyone recognizes.  Yeah.  Suck it up.  Take the dump question.  She's daddy's little disappointment.  Right.  Kenny, you were hilarious because they were parading the porn stars to us at that table when we broadcasted  Saturday.  I have no idea how that show sounded, but Kenny was hilarious going here.  Bring on the next what? 
[02:02:00]  Sperm catcher.  Sperm catcher.  Walking semen receptacle.  Guys, our next cum dumpster is here.  Right to their face.  Uh-oh, it was great.  Well, I just want to thank you again for a lovely weekend.  You guys did a great job, and I'll see you guys soon.  Kenny, I cannot thank you enough for your assistance in Vegas.  You did a bang-up job.  It was my pleasure.  See you, Kenny.  All right.  Take care, boys.  Stay close because we're going to play more of your interviews after the break, all right? 
[02:02:30]  I hear you.  All right.  There he goes.  Club soda.  Kenny, everyone, a quick answer to a question from John in New York.  John, go ahead.  The chick in the cooler is Maria Bello.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  She was the one from ER, right?  Right, right.  And earlier, Anthony was talking about the movie with the switching the keys.  Oh, the swingers thing.  That ant brought up, yes.  That was the ice storm.  Oh, really?  The ice storm?  The ice storm with... 
[02:03:00]  Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver.  Kevin Spacey.  I said the wrong name.  Oh, okay.  You also gave me the wrong name?  No, Estella Warren.  She's the really good-looking one in the cooler.  Well, John says different.  It's Maria Bello, the chick from ER.  All right, then there was two.  Oh, all right.  Thank you, John.  All right, guys.  You're great.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  All right, why don't we take a quick break, right?  Thank you, John.  Oh, what are we up to?  What kind of an angle is that? 
[02:03:30]  Oh, why do I have to look up Xbox ass?  One night in China on the video today in the studio.  This is awful.  You don't see anything.  Right now, she's laying on her back, and he's, like, kneeling between her legs, taking care  of her, but you can only see his back and the back of his head.  Yeah.  And you can't see anything.  No, you see her knees.  That's about it.  With a lot of bad music.  You have bad background distraction noise.  Can I say one thing in pornography? 
[02:04:00]  Stop with the music.  I don't need it.  I despise music and pornography.  You don't want music in there?  Totally takes me out of it.  Huh.  You just want the sounds of love.  Dude, I like that.  That's sexy to me.  That's hot.  Yeah.  I agree with you on that one.  All right.  I thought she was going to moan some more.  Her moans are really, really disturbing.  I hate overly produced, music-laden porn.  It stinks.  All right.  We got to take another quick. 
[02:04:30]  This is going to be a very quick break, and we'll continue with some more of Club Soda  Kenny's interviews with the porn chicks.  They're kind of funny.  Nice.  What did you say?  Helmet or anteater?  Helmet head or anteater.  Yeah, that was classic.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton Coffee Diva?  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.

[02:07:30]  I want to see the bob shot.  They're showing the mudslides in California, and I say it serves them right.  Oh, we're just talking about how these people out there in California, they want these houses with these, you know, these great views and vistas.  Vistas.  Vistas.  And knowing at any given time that it could rain really hard and heavy there in California, and there'll be a mudslide, and it'll take your house away. 
[02:08:00]  Washes right down the side of the mountain.  And then we watch the coverage and feel sorry for these people.  They know what they got themselves into.  I could actually whack my bag watching this mudslide.  It's better than this stupid China video.  This is the worst camera angle I've ever seen in porn.  And it's just awful, uh, homemade porno.  Now X-Pac's just really nailing her.  You can't see anything. 
[02:08:30]  That's why.  It really gives you an appreciation of what they really do in porno.  This is what we do as civilians when we try to make it.  It's a disaster.  Awful.  Awful music.  Aw, he's just, he's just going to town, man.  Oops.  Is that Hendrix in the background?  Is that Purple Haze?  Oh, what crap that is.  I don't know what it is. 
[02:09:00]  Really slamming her, though.  Slowing down.  What was X-Pac's finishing move?  I don't remember what his finishing move was.  Stop with the music.  Oh, let's see that.  What's slapping?  That's his balls.  Is it his balls?  Yeah.  Wow, he's a real go-getter, man.  Oh.  All right, anyway.  You could have put the camera where you could actually see what's going on. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, how about getting it, uh...  I would put the camera kind of over her head.  It's from, like, five feet away, and you can kind of see them on an angle,  and you can see them going at it, but all you can see is their legs.  You can't see any real contact.  No.  You want penetration.  It's terrible.  Wow, this is, it's kind of creepy to look at, actually.  All right, Anthony.  So we got Club Soda Kenny at the porn convention interviewing porn stars.  Trying to offend them. 
[02:10:00]  I don't know if he was trying to offend them.  I don't know if he's smart enough to try to offend them.  Yeah.  I think he's just really big and stupid and just talks.  He offended the first one.  He sure did.  Well, here's his interview with Sunset Thomas.  How you doing?  It's Club Soda Kenny.  I'm here at the Hustler booth with Sunset Thomas.  Say hello, Sunset.  Well, hi there.  How's everybody out there doing?  This is for the Opie and Anthony radio show on XM Satellite Radio.  Do you love Opie and Anthony?  I love you guys.  I've heard you before.  You're great. 
[02:10:30]  How much do you love them?  I love them so much I'd like to suck their cocks.  Nice.  You've got to respect that.  You've got a favorite fetish?  You know what?  No one knows this, but I love my feet to be sucked.  Okay.  It turns me on.  It makes me get all tingly when someone sucks my feet.  All right.  I'd go for that.  What do you think about guys that like to get pissed off?  No comment.  Because, you know, Jimmy Norton, who's a feature on the Opie and Anthony show,  he loves that fetish of urination and fecal matter. 
[02:11:00]  All over him.  Well, you know what?  Next time if I go on their show, I'm just going to have to piss all over him.  Cool.  He'll believe me.  He's going to leak clear stuff when he hears that.  Let me ask you, what do you like?  Helmet head or anteater?  What was the first one?  Helmet head or anteater?  Ant eaters.  Okay.  Did you make a reservation for the tsunami?  No.  All right.  And who do you want to win in the presidential election? 
[02:11:30]  I don't vote.  All right.  I'm bad.  I'm so bad.  I didn't vote for that all this year.  What did you have to eat today?  Actually, you want to know the honest truth?  Nothing.  I've been so busy saying that.  I haven't eaten at all.  All right.  Did you ever hook up with John Doe here?  Oh, yeah.  He's awesome.  We actually shot a movie, White Rabbit.  What's he packing?  He's packing a big one, baby.  I see.  All right.  All right.  White text as well.  Anything else you want to hear to say to the listeners in America? 
[02:12:00]  I just want to say, you guys and ladies, I love you very much, and keep on jerking off to me.  I love it.  Nice.  All right.  Thanks for taking the time to talk to us.  Have fun here.  Keep on jerking off to me.  That's the type of...  She's great, though.  Celebrity.  We go way back with Sunset Thomas.  But that's the reaction that's appropriate for those silly questions.  Right.  She just kind of went with it, and she's goofing off with them.  She doesn't care.  Yeah, not getting offended.  Actually, she was great because, yeah, she's not taking herself seriously. 
[02:12:30]  She understands what's going on.  She makes these movies, and people are whacking off.  It's porno.  There you go.  Toolbag is a little pissed off at Norton.  Norton, did Norton just refer to everyone outside of the porn industry as civilians, like we're some sort of peons?  I mean myself, too, stupid.  And when it comes to porn, yes, we are peons.  Yes.  Yeah.  But I'm included in that.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  Come on.  Uh-oh.  All right.  That is so nice.  No, it's not.  Now we've got a close-up of China's vag. 
[02:13:00]  And that looks like a chicken.  That looks like a mini-me penis.  And that stupid piercing, get it out of there.  That is a schlong.  Oh, my God.  It's just.  Oh.  All right.  Too.  It's too.  Oh, now we've got to get a nice over-the-head shot of Xbox junk.  There's X-cock.  That is one bent stick he's got there.  It really is. 
[02:13:30]  What the hell happened to that thing?  It looks good.  Took a wrong turn somewhere.  Was that hurt in the ring some time?  Did he get injured?  I don't know.  Too many Bronco busters.  Please take that piercing out.  I feel comfortable.  Bad piercings are awful.  All right.  She's sitting on a counter completely naked.  What?  She got a C-section scar?  What?  She have a kid or something?  Or is that from a...  I don't know. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, she's going...  Oh, he's licking it.  Oh, no.  I would, too.  I am going to gag.  This is so disgusting.  It really is.  Look at it.  It's the worst porno ever.  Look at this thing.  He's...  He's...  I don't like this because it focuses only on his face.  Yeah, but the thing pops up that's supposed to be a...  It's like watching Kirk Hammett go down on a girl.  It's not hot.  All right.  We'll go back to that in a little bit.  But, Anthony, here's Club Soda Kenny talking to... 
[02:14:30]  Oh, God.  I know, talking to...  Let me see that.  Talking to Jessica...  Like a little pinky.  Jessica James, Anthony.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Club Soda Kenny here at the Hustle Boat.  And who are you, lovely lady?  My name is Jessica James, first ever contract girl, and we are here at 2005 AVN.  And I must say, you are stunning.  But can I ask you, do you have any fetishes?  Do I have any...  Nothing too crazy.  Maybe a spank fetish. 
[02:15:00]  I think I like to beat a little ass rather than take an ass beating.  No.  Asses are good.  Believe me.  What do you think about guys that like to get pissed on?  Because one of the guys on the radio show loves that.  I would gladly piss on someone.  I've got no problem with it.  Is it a fetish of mine?  No.  But I wouldn't mind pissing on someone.  Can you say, Jimmy, I want to piss on you?  Jimmy, I really want to piss on you.  Nice.  Nice.  He also rolls shit in his pockets.  What do you think about that?  I think it's disgusting.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Listen.  How long have you been doing this?  I've been doing this for about three years.  I've only been under contract for about two months with Hustler.  That's cool.  What did you eat today?  What did I eat today?  I ate absolutely nothing because I've been signing my ass off.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Did you make a reservation for the tsunami?  No, I didn't make a reservation for the tsunami.  And I'm kicking myself right now.  Yeah.  But I didn't do that.  All right.  And who do you want to win the presidential election?  Who do I want to win the presidential election? 
[02:16:00]  Actually, I really want to bring Bill Clinton back, to tell you the truth.  I thought he rocked.  Why?  Because he's got a big cock?  Well, I don't know about his cock.  You'd have to ask, what's her name, Monica Lewinsky.  But no, because he was honest.  He did drugs.  He fucking fucked on the side.  I think he's a badass motherfucker.  I think we should bring him back.  That's terrific.  I like your attitude.  Thanks for taking the time to talk with us.  Have fun here.  And there it is.  Club Soda Kenny talking to Jessica James.  I'm feeling faint watching this porno.  This could be the worst porno ever. 
[02:16:30]  X-Pac is going down on China.  And it just...  It looks like someone at an all-they-can-eat steak buffet filling his mouth up.  That stupid piercing is really irritating me.  It takes away from the meatiness.  And that's the sounds of diarrhea hitting the toilet.  Yeah, what is that?  There you go, right there.  That's hot.  Who's puking? 
[02:17:00]  The cameraman as he films this thing?  I couldn't get a rod on camera, but I don't film myself.  Now she's taking her foot to X-Cock.  Rubbing X-Cock's...  And now she's back to...  On her knees.  What, baby?  What?  Who's filming this thing?  He is.  Nasty implants he's got.  You hear two guys, though. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, it's kind of big right there.  No, it doesn't.  It looks bent.  Oh, that's her voice.  Yeah.  It sounds so manly.  I thought it was another guy in the room.  It is big, X-Cock.  It doesn't look that big.  No.  Got like six and a half or seven.  What is that?  You're amazing.  All right, there she's going to town on X-Cock.  She's good, though.  She's got good technique.  You'll give her that.  Yeah.  Takes it all like a champ.  Wow. 
[02:18:00]  But, ugh.  What a mess she is.  Stop looking at the camera, stupid.  Get back to work.  Get back to work.  Incredibly gorgeous.  Sexy dialogue there.  Right.  Looks so incredibly gorgeous.  He's got that stuffed nose.  He sounds like the little nerdy kid from My Bodyguard who was friends with Clifford.  Redheaded boy.  Hey, we have James Leisure on the line here.  Hey, James.  Yeah.  How are you, buddy?  I'm good, man.  How are you? 
[02:18:30]  Good.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  And in the studio, we're looking at One Night in China.  You ever see that one?  Yeah, I heard about that.  Yeah, it's one of the latest of pseudo-celebrity pornos that are making the rounds.  Yeah, we're in Vegas, and we brought home a lot of stuff from the porn convention.  And we got the China video, and we don't know what to think of this thing.  It sounds like it's mostly awful, but on some level, I think I'm aroused.  I don't know.  Yeah, any kind of porno, it's all right to check out, but this is really bad. 
[02:19:00]  She's a mess down there, and they're not professional.  The camera work sucks.  She's now getting it doggy style, James, just in case you're keeping score at home there.  And he's facing north, and she's facing east because this stupid mule is bent to the right.  This is a horrible, horrible piece of pornography.  His mule took a wrong turn somewhere, James.  It's a mess.  It's like watching a girl get fucked with a T-square. 
[02:19:30]  Or a boomerang.  He's got a crooked one.  He really does that well.  Yeah, I've got to see it.  I have to see it, though.  Unbelievable.  So, James, you're in that Las Vegas TV show.  It's called Las Vegas, right?  I am, yeah, and it is.  I've got to be honest.  We've never seen Las Vegas.  Thanks, fellas.  Thanks for the support.  Well, you can see what we're kind of interested in over here.  We're too busy with bad pornography.  Yeah, we haven't seen James on Las Vegas, but we're seeing trying to get banged right now. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  Well, we've got a hotness on our show, man.  We have a few young ladies that are, you know, regulars on the cast that are quite hot.  So, I don't think you'd be disappointed in that respect.  Who else is on the show?  We've got James Kahn, Josh Jumel, Nicky Cox, Marsha Thomason, Molly Sims, and, of course, Vanessa Marcel.  Ah.  So, we've got hotness. 
[02:20:30]  And where are you filming that?  In Vegas?  A little bit in Vegas, mostly in L.A.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You get to have a little fun, though, out there in Vegas when you're out?  Yeah, yeah, man.  We cut up a little bit.  It stays in Vegas, though.  It stays in Vegas.  What is the premise of the show?  Uh, it basically follows a major casino, and, uh, it's from the vantage point of the security  and surveillance aspect of it.  You sort of get behind the scenes of the security aspect, love Vegas.  Yeah, people getting worked over and stuff for trying to cheat. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, and different kind of cheats, and, uh, you know, that come through, and, you know,  everybody's got a story.  I like that.  Have you seen any of the inside security things?  Because we were wondering about coolers.  Do you know anything about coolers?  Nah.  And I wanted to see that movie.  Have you seen that movie?  Yeah, it's great.  I liked it.  I hate Alec Baldwin, but he did a great job in that flick.  You know, Alec Baldwin has been on my show a couple of times.  Really?  Yeah.  What did he do on the show?  Yeah, he just plays a character of, like, a CIA dude who, uh, because James Caan has 
[02:21:30]  this CIA background, and so they sort of worked with each other in the past, and, you know,  that a couple of times, and I loved working with him.  How's James Caan to work with?  Fun.  He's fun.  Really?  A million stories, and, you know, he's still, to me, really good.  Guy's a legend.  Yeah.  Can you ever look at him without thinking of Sonny Corleone?  I wouldn't be able to look at him without thinking of Sonny.  I mean, you know, he's, uh, you know, Sonny is a younger dude.  This kid is, uh, this James Caan, this James Caan's a little older. 
[02:22:00]  You know, he's still a, he's still a tough kid, but he's a little older, so.  Yeah.  It says here on your resume that you did in 2002, you played What Wouldn't Jesus Do?  You played Jesus Christ.  That's right, brother.  How was it?  It was fun.  It was like this little short film, independent thing.  It was cool.  It was written and directed by a friend of mine, Rod E. Mill, and, uh, I had a good time with  it.  And you played, I'm sorry, was it, was it, it was a serious film?  Was it, was it historically accurate or was it something? 
[02:22:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Jesus, I mean, they introduced my character.  I'm coming up on Crenshaw dribbling a basketball, you know, he just kind of, it was like, dude,  Jesus, what would he be like in modern times?  Like, how would he be?  So.  Now, what I see is, uh, you're, you're in a sequel to one of the scariest movies I ever  saw in my life.  Uh, The Ring 2.  How about that?  You're in that.  Now, what did you think of the first one?  The Ring 2 is scary.  Wait, yo, what's going on in the porno, though, right now?  Sorry.  Yeah, don't mind that. 
[02:23:00]  It's a little distracting, I understand, James, but, uh, we're very interested in talking to  you today.  Yeah, I think X-Pac is going to town on China's ass.  It's the same angle, and nothing has changed in 40 minutes.  It sounds like there should be a money shot any second now, though.  Yeah.  It's really terrible.  You guys gotta send me a copy, man.  That's incredible.  How was the porn convention this weekend?  Oh, man, uh, half our show, uh, loved it, and, uh, I don't know, I kind of didn't get 
[02:23:30]  the whole thing.  I mean, I get the porno, I like it and all, but, but just walking around with these sleaze  bags to shake hands and take pictures with them, I kind of wasn't getting it, but a couple  of people on our show really dug it.  A lot of porno, we, we got our hands on a lot of that, as you can hear in the background.  Right.  Wow.  That can come in handy if you get one.  Yeah, you know, you just watch, like, a five-minute clip of it, though, and you're,  you're pretty much done.  Right.  I loved it, though.  I always enjoy, I, I don't know why I have such an affection for porn people.  I don't know, I, I think they get kind of shit on by mainstream. 
[02:24:00]  Right, right.  Uncontainment, because people like to deny what it is we really like.  I don't know.  I mean, I know I'm an appreciator of porn myself.  I wouldn't mind checking it out.  I haven't been able to do so yet.  Well, people have this condescending attitude about it, like, you know, dirty and naughty,  and yet we spend money to look at them and whack our bags.  Right, right, right.  But, um, I think he's going for the money shot here.  Oh, is it?  I can't tell.  Nothing, all you can see right now is her, her ass cheeks and his lower stomach and 
[02:24:30]  half a bent mule pounded away.  And it's, it's absolutely awful.  It's really, it's, it's a horrible piece of pornography.  And it's never good when the woman needs, like, a lot of clearasil on her ass cheeks.  I don't mind a little pimply ass.  That's kind of, it makes it human.  I can relate to that, yeah.  And it sounds like there's a lot of deep, uh, bass panting, you know, I, I'm a fan of  the, uh, feminine, higher-pitched panting.  Yeah, well, China is kind of, you know, a little manly to begin with, so.  Right.  Yeah, when you hear it, oh, that's good. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  Would you fuck me?  I'd fuck me.  And he just pans in the mirror so they can watch themselves.  Yeah.  And not only is, is her, her implant job is really awful from that angle.  Great.  Uh, but there's a lot of messy stuff on the counter.  And now she's, she's giving him a hummer, I think, to finish him off.  Is that how we're going to get the money shot?  I'm thinking so, yeah.  And this is actually pretty hot.  Yeah, when she, when she does that, it's actually pretty sexy.  Yeah, she's got, uh, good technique, uh, James.  Uh, James, James, The Ring 2, does it follow, uh, does it follow, uh, in line with the first 
[02:25:30]  one?  Uh, it does, it does.  Uh, I, I, I hope, hopefully it'll be good.  I, I, I read the script and, uh, I thought, uh, it was enjoyable, so.  First one's gotta be one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  Thank you.  I completely, it horrified me when I saw it.  Very creepy, that old, uh, uh, video look.  Yeah, the whole look of it.  Yeah, very creepy.  And then when that thing came out of the TV at the end, holy Jesus, scared the shit  out of me.  Dude, I watched that movie alone.  Somebody got me a bootleg copy. 
[02:26:00]  I watched that alone in my apartment.  I had to turn on my lights.  Yeah.  I'm 36 years old.  Scary.  Um, remember, in the beginning when there's a scene with a girl, the first scene where she  gets horrified and she, and, and they pan to her in the closet.  Yeah.  And you see that scared to death look on her face.  Dude, stop, right?  Did that scare the crap out of you?  I got goosebumps.  Really creeped me out.  So, you're, I didn't even know there was a sequel until he just said it.  I think that's fantastic coming out.  Yeah, I think it, it, it honors that whole thing.  Hopefully it'll be just, you know, sequels are sometimes tough, I think, to pull off. 
[02:26:30]  Sometimes?  We can achieve it.  How about always?  Yeah, it's very rare you get a great sequel.  Except for Godfather 2.  Name another one.  Especially in horror, it seems.  Horror films are hard to have a good sequel to, unless you're Nightmare on Elm Street.  The Jaws 3D was great.  Yeah.  Was Halloween the only great one on Halloween?  Oh, yeah.  Halloween was a great one.  Oh.  Sure.  Caddyshack 2 was pretty, uh...  It could have been the worst film ever made.  For a horror film, Caddyshack 2 was alright.  For a comedy, it was horrendous.  No, but in all fairness, the sequels nowadays, yeah, they're starting to match the originals. 
[02:27:00]  A little better?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know?  Yeah.  The second Matrix wasn't bad.  Lord of the Rings.  Right.  If you're into the Harry Potter movies, they all were good.  Harry Potter.  I said, if you're into the...  Actually, they're not bad films, so check it out.  Yeah, they're really not.  I understand in part three, he's shirtless.  That's why I make a girl really hot.  So when does this come out, The Ring 2?  I have no idea.  Well, he says 2005.  He cares more about the show Las Vegas.  Of course.  We're going to have to check out Las Vegas. 
[02:27:30]  It's obviously getting good reviews and stuff, but we just haven't seen it, James.  We're not going to lie to you.  Yo, it's Monday night.  It comes on at 9 o'clock out here in L.A., so y'all check it out tonight and get back  with me and let me know what you think.  Okay, it's on tonight, sure.  And season one is on DVD?  Yep.  Okay, is it available yet or is it coming out?  Yep, it is available.  Okay, right on.  And you were in Crimson Tide, too.  How cool is that?  Yeah, it was cool back in the day, man.  Hey, were you in the room when Gene Hackman slapped Denzel?  Were you in the room for that scene?  I wasn't for that scene, but what a powerful scene that was. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, it was a great flick.  Yeah.  Those are two heavyweights going at it, man.  It's a good movie to me.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, James, thanks for having fun with us today.  We appreciate it.  All the best, brothers.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  If you want a copy of this video, we'll get it for you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on.  There he goes, James.  Take care, James.  James Leisure from Las Vegas.  Very cool.  That was hilarious with the porn going in the background.  They cut out the money shot, by the way.  They cut it out?  Yeah, it looks like they don't give you the money shot.  No, there's got to be a money shot. 
[02:28:30]  They cut it out?  Yeah, because they're onto a new scene here.  Yeah, maybe they just stopped and they're moving on.  He very possibly couldn't.  What do you mean?  Sometime, maybe.  He doesn't seem like he's too comfortable in front of the camera.  He's shy, a little gun shy.  Yeah, maybe he couldn't, as we would say in the business, maybe the pop shot wasn't able  to be achieved.  Oh, God, look at her bong.  I like that.  Oh.  No, this is awful.  Wait, let me ask you.  Did he give a FIP?  A FIP?  Oh, people in the business would know.  That's what they do in softcore. 
[02:29:00]  It's called a fake internal pop.  Oh, oh, where they just make the face.  Yeah, I was wondering if he gave a FIP.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know there's a word for everything.  No, I know.  A lot of the civilians are on the stage.  Anthony, as we go to break, we have another interview from Club Soda Kenny.  He interviewed another hustler chick.  Festiva.  Festiva?  At the porn convention.  All right.  We'll check this out, and we'll continue.  Club Soda Kenny.  We're still at the hustle booth, and I got another hot chick to talk to.  What's your name, honey?  The Tiva Rose. 
[02:29:30]  You are beautiful, if I must say.  What's your fetish?  What's my fetish?  I'm into tying up girls and doing away with them.  So you're not Strictly Dickly.  You're into women also.  All right.  That's cool.  How about guys that like to get pissed on?  Sometimes.  I'll tolerate it.  Because, you know, our own little Jimmy from the radio show, he loves the piss and the shit.

So everybody just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I said this looks like a job for me.  So everybody just follow me.  Because we need a little controversy.  Because it feels so empty without me.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[02:33:30]  Kind of screwing off today.  A little jet lag from our Vegas trip just a tad.  We want to thank James Leisure for calling the program.  We have one night in China in the studio right now.  We're watching that.  She took it up the pooper for like two seconds.  Didn't look like she was enjoying it.  So now they're back to regular type sex.  She's, uh, I guess they're doing it doggy style now.  And the camera's showing her face from the side. 
[02:34:00]  And some of the pillow.  Nice camera work, Kubrick.  Some of her huge back.  God almighty, this is horrendous.  What was your comment about this is what happens when real people try to make a porno or something like that?  This is absolutely what happens.  Well, this guy I'm sure is a decent lay.  You can see he's decent in bed.  And I'm sure she is.  But everyone thinks that they can do it.  Every idiot thinks that we're going to be sexy on camera.  And this is what you get.  Bad camera angles.  Aiming at the pillow.  He's pumping way too fast to be sexy.  Who cares?  Well, it's tough to work the camera and bang at the same time. 
[02:34:30]  The guy is holding the camera with one hand.  If you're an amateur.  And then the left hand, he's holding her hip.  Dude, if you're going to do a POV, you at least have to know a point of view.  That's what they call those in the industry.  Again, that was what Funtman was very instrumental as by my segue back to what we discussed.  That's where he was a genius, actually.  At least know what you're doing.  Be a professional.  If you know what you're doing, you should come out good.  I can't even watch this.  I'm just, I'm smelling. 
[02:35:00]  I'm smelling their sex in this room just looking at this.  It's disgusting.  I would be more turned on if right now a wave just washed a bunch of bodies over both of them.  Please show that.  He's got some stamina, though, man.  I'm not saying he's a bad guy.  This guy's been banging all the...  I mean, really hard through the whole commercial break.  Yeah, he's going.  He's decent, but...  He's a wrestler, you know?  He's got the stamina.  I could never bang like that.  My mule would lose sensation.  Oh, she is disgusting, man. 
[02:35:30]  There you go.  There's the...  There's the FIP.  What?  Oh, that was the FIP?  Faking tunnel pop.  Sure he didn't do anything.  All right.  Now they're...  All right.  Now they're on to another scene here.  How much of this can you take?  Not one good pop shot.  Oh, there we go.  I like that.  All right.  Now he's...  Now she's on her back.  That awful piercing wrecking that beautiful thing she has.  And here they go again.  Beautiful, dude.  Here they go again. 
[02:36:00]  It looks like...  It looks like that drawing,  Kilroy was here in the war.  That big clit nose hanging over a fence.  Kilroy was here.  That's pretty good.  It really does look like Big Bird should be talking to him.  All right.  What do you guys want to do next?  We're trying to wrap up our coverage of the porn convention.  Yeah, with our audio.  We have other interviews in front of us.  I might need Steven here because I wasn't here for this stuff.  No.  It's some interviews with Justin Slayer. 
[02:36:30]  I don't know who he is.  No.  I've never heard of him.  Norton interviewing the Lowrider guys.  I don't know what that is.  What is that?  The guys from the Bouncy Toilet.  That's the Lowrider.  Oh, Lowrider.  And then Tanya the Transsexual.  We have video of that, so you've got to see Tanya.  No, we don't.  You really do.  It's really hot.  Really hot.  It's a man.  No, it's a girl.  It's a man.  No, she's lovely.  Got a schlong.  Got nuts.  No.  I just made a slight error.  Steve?  There it is.  There's your money shot. 
[02:37:00]  There's the money shot.  Two drips.  Two drips.  What the hell is that about?  Awful.  Yeah.  And that's that.  That was a hot money shot.  This is sexier.  Him at the Great Wall.  Very attractive.  Now he's reflecting at the Great Wall of China.  And you know, they probably just took some externals in China and did all the banging in a hotel in New York somewhere.  Of course.  Why not?  That's good.  OneNightInChina.com.  What do you want?  What do we need?  The deleted scenes?  Maybe a little shopping?  All right. 
[02:37:30]  Can we go to the Paris video, please?  Yeah.  Pop.  Credits.  Edited by Johnny Fly, starring Joni and Sean.  If you'd like to see more titles from Red Light District video, check out our website.  All right.  Anyway, Steve, we have Chinese guys.  What is all this stuff?  Okay, the Chinese guys' audio came from Jimmy and I walked out of the convention.  I think we were going to lunch.  Was that it?  And we see this roly-poly security guard being shoved down the line by these four irate Chinese guys with a bunch of bags they got from the CES. 
[02:38:00]  And they were just shoving them.  And here's this guy.  He's pissed off.  He's screaming, leave me alone.  Get off me.  So we just keep following them.  I start videotaping it, and they're just pushing and pushing.  And finally, the organizers from the convention come over, as well as this guy's head of security.  And you come to realize that it certainly sounds like these guys were waiting on line to get into the expo, 
[02:38:30]  and this guy was walking the line telling people that he would take money to let them cut the line and get in.  Oh.  And I guess he ripped them for like 60 bucks and then walked away.  Then they found him.  And then they just went after him.  He's fat with a limp, and he has awful baggy pants, and his collar is askew.  And he kept going, take your hands off me, man.  I'm just trying to do my job.  Just trying to do my job.  And this one Chinese guy, I guess he thought he had these three weak, non-English-speaking guys.  And this one guy was about to bite his face. 
[02:39:00]  Because this Asian guy kept grabbing his arm and muscling him.  He wanted his money back.  Yeah.  And you know this fat scumbag ripped these three guys off.  And I don't think they had AVN, but I don't think they had gotten into the expo yet.  No, they hadn't.  They might have just gotten the bags outside.  They had like a place you could just pick up a bag in case you were going to go in.  Uh-huh.  And they were hot.  And the guy kept going, I'm just trying to do my job.  Take your hands off me.  And they were just shoving him, and nobody would do anything.  It was great.  Wow.  It's an old nightclub trick.  Like, if you're a bouncer, you hold a line sometimes.  And people come up, and they offer you money to cut the line kind of thing.  But this guy did it all wrong.  He basically just walked away after taking these guys' money. 
[02:39:30]  And they found him and got pissed off and started fighting with him.  And instead of just, after he was getting out of hand, giving him back their money, because  you knew he was lying.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of just giving him back the money and going, all right, look, whatever, and getting  rid of him, he just kept it going.  And hopefully he got fired.  I wish we could have followed up.  Why would these stupids give him money, though?  Because, dude, you saw the line was a quarter mile long.  And he probably figured, look, if this guy can get me all the way to the front, why not  $20 each?  $60?  What dopes?  Because that line was an hour, two hours long.  Absolutely.  Easily. 
[02:40:00]  Easily.  Well, we mean stupid Steve, because we got on the monorail to go to the porn awards, and  the monorail got stuck as we're on our way to the porn awards.  So we ran down to Bally's and had to take a limo, and it cost us $40, and we realized  it was a block and a half.  So we spent $40 to go a block and a half.  That monorail there just stinks.  It's constantly breaking down.  I'd rather hop on Rick Solomon's mule and have him take us.  Very impressive, Rick.  Oh, this is the Paris video now?  Yeah, the Paris Hilton video.  At least he's keeping a rod. 
[02:40:30]  At least this is fairly a sexy video.  Oh.  What are they talking about?  Or is that a TV in the background?  Chris Rock is playing.  That's what you need to keep a rod.  Chris Rock's voice.  Maybe he's got a rod because it's her and not China.  Exactly.  Paris Hilton.  Not China he's looking at.  He doesn't need any help to get a rod. 
[02:41:00]  Do we have to have 10 minutes of him whacking his bag?  We get it.  With that creepy night vision.  Yeah, those stupid owl eyes he has glowing.  The glowing cat eyes and the headlights.  All right, so here's the audio of the Chinese guys.  Yeah, we walked up to the Chinese guys and asked them what happened.  And he had awful teeth.  Awful chipped brown teeth.  Oh, yay.  And garbage breath.  And we got about 40 seconds in before the security guys and the organizer of the convention  yelled at us to turn off the mics.  Oh, let's check it out. 
[02:41:30]  I don't know.  Okay, actually, we just went, I just go from the CES show.  Yeah.  And I heard from my friend, and here's a doubt show here.  So three of us, okay, two of my friends will come over, take a look.  First time being here.  Okay, I just, when I'm waiting for a line, I just ask me, okay, my friend asked him,  how can we buy the ticket?  Okay, he said, buy the ticket here, 20 bucks for each.  Then you can go, I send somebody, I will send you three guys in. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  Okay.  So I give him 60 bucks, and I get nothing.  One more.  Okay.  Right now, sir.  Sir.  One more.  Sir, I'm show management.  I said stop.  Wow, this is, I don't know.  I have no idea what the Chinese guy just said, because, wow, Paris is getting banged.  Yeah.  That is so much hotter.  Yeah, it is.  That is.  That's actually a better shot, too. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  That is messed up there.  We're watching Paris Hilton get banged.  The night vision's a little odd on her boobs, because you'd really see every vein in this  girl's body.  Get that night vision off.  Turn on a light, you prude.  Let's see it all.  Yeah, I didn't understand what that Chinese guy was talking about. 
[02:43:00]  No.  He was saying that they were online, and the guy said, I can get you in.  We're online.  You buy tickets here, and they just hand the guy 50 bucks.  50 dollar.  50 dollar.  Oh.  There you go.  She's a good egg.  Look at this.  A trooper.  She's kind of lazed there, though.  And anyone can get this video now, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  This is fully available online or in stores.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in Ohio.  Matt, what's going on?  Not much.  I just don't understand why you guys are even talking about Paris.  I mean, she's just a worthless whore, you know?  I agree.  Well, of course she is.  But, I mean, she's basically, she's famous for being famous and for starring in a low-budget porn video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And?  And, you know, it's not even like she has any talent in the video.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  She's, uh, she does this kind of lay there.  She's just got to be naked.  That's all she has to do.  Yeah, but, I mean, her plastic surgery on her face is awful, and you see her in their sidekick commercial,  and they say, I want to kick her in the side, just like the dog.  Sucky fucking $15.  All right, thank you, Matt.  That's all I got, guys.  I'm punching out.  See you later.  Hey, big spender, give us your money.  So, what's going on with these Justin Slayer?  Are these worth playing?  Justin Slayer, yeah.  Just to hear him explain what it, you know, what it is he does and the kind of movies he directs. 
[02:44:30]  He's a black guy who directs for Evil Angel, I believe.  And we stopped him in the lobby of the Venetian to ask him about what he was working on,  the kind of movies, and have him explain all the different things.  And, you know, he's just got different terms that he uses for all these porno, ah, whatever.  Steve's all flabbergasted.  Yeah, it really, no, no, no, like all the techniques, like hip-to-ass ratio was one of the things he was describing.  Hey, Toolbag wants to know if the three Asian guys put on Steve's shirt in protest. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, wow.  All right.  Mal and Gong is easier to understand.  Yeah, we're getting some people that didn't quite get the Chinese guys.  A little doggy-style action Paris and...  Oh.  Oh, there we go.  That's a much better angle there.  You can see a little bit.  What do you mean she doesn't have talent?  She's got a nice technique there.  Is there a video of the fat guy being shoved?  You have a video of that, right? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, there.  All right, well, here's some Justin Slayer.  I'm sitting here in the lobby of the Venetian with Justin Slayer.  Did you hear that?  What?  Listen to Steve's voice.  What?  You went into reporter mode.  Oh.  You're talking to a porn dude.  Listen to his voice.  Really?  I'm sitting here in the lobby of the Venetian with Justin Slayer who directed Big Boots.  I'm sitting in the lobby.  You're in the lobby.  I'm sitting in the lobby. 
[02:46:00]  He's ready to take off his glasses and announce that Kennedy is dead.  I don't even care what Justin Slayer has to say now because all I can hear is you.  I'm sitting in the lobby.  I'm sitting in the lobby of the Venetian with Justin Slayer who directed Big Booty White Girls.  The Fatty Girls line, Fatty Girls.  Explain the concept behind Big Booty White Girls.  Big Booty White Girls.  Okay, cool, cool. 
[02:46:30]  You know, I felt there was a need in the void in the marketplace for a title like that.  You know, I already did the Big Booty Black Girls title which was Fatty Girls and I wanted  to do something similar but, you know, because there's a lot of white girls with Big Booty  now, you know what I mean?  So, that's what we did, you know what I mean?  We went out to, you know, different places and found them, you know what I mean?  We went to Europe where they breed them over there like that, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:47:00]  Not necessarily, you know, fat girls but just, you know, but just...  Fat, fat.  P-H-A-T fat, you know.  But, no, I mean like F-A-T is like a legal piece, you know, kind of thing.  You're not looking for that.  You're looking for...  Nah, nah, nah.  Just, you know, we're looking at different things like for real, you know, people, you  know, because it's a fetish, man.  The ass is a fetish, you know.  It's people that really study that shit like hip to waist ratios and, you know what I mean?  Depth of the ass, you know, the crack of the ass, you know what I'm saying?  Hip to waist ratio?  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, you know, the ratio between the hip circumference and the waist circumference. 
[02:47:30]  You know what I mean?  That's the taper, that gives you that V, that V shape, you know what I mean?  That everybody is looking for, that hourglass, you know what I mean?  And people study it?  Yeah, yeah, motherfuckers study that shit, man.  Yeah.  Booteologists, ass aficionals and shit.  You ever shoot Olivia Saint?  Olivia Saint, yeah, yeah, I shot Olivia Saint.  I'm going to shoot her again. 
[02:48:00]  She got that hip to waist ratio we're talking about, you know what I mean?  All right, well, there's the...  You know what I mean?  There's Steven.  Interviewing Justin Slayer.  Should booty be used anymore?  How old is the word booty?  And it's so done.  Wow, Jimmy.  What?  You stunk the shit out of this place.  Oh, sorry, I thought that was the video.  No.  Oh, God.  No, we got rid of the China video.  I got nervous.  The sounds of Paris Hilton getting banged from behind, everybody. 
[02:48:30]  I'm here in the Venetian.  Here in the Venetian.  We're watching...  I thought I was listening to Brit Hume.  I know.  What a guy.  Steve taking his interviews very seriously.  It doesn't matter who it is that he's interviewing.  That's right.  Now, here's Justin Slayer talking about Double Adol.  That's right.  Steve's interview with Justin Slayer.  You've starred in cum-guzzling whores.  Tell me a little about your motivation.  Well, you know, you might as well do it right.  You know what?  He almost sounds like Phil Hartman. 
[02:49:00]  You might remember me.  Exactly.  You know what?  Fuck it.  Do it right.  So many guys approach this trying to make the people look stupid that are doing it.  Let's not bullshit each other.  It's a $10 billion business.  I'm going to ask this guy about what he does.  Tell us about Double Adol.  The ins and outs of Double Adol.  Exactly.  Comment?  Sure.  Please, enlighten us on some of the obstacles that must be overcame in the fisting. 
[02:49:30]  Really?  We do need to get better audio equipment, though, for these interviews.  I understand that it's outside.  We have to get something a little bit better.  Yeah.  How about a real recording device that you could...  We had one.  They actually gave us one.  It was a little compact handheld computer with a microphone, and it crapped out after 30 seconds.  Thank you very much.  So I had to go and improvise with the...  Oof.  Oh.  That's a nice view.  Yeah, backward cowgirl, bro.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Reverse cowgirl. 
[02:50:00]  Reverse cowgirl.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I don't have all the porn terminology down perfect.  I'm not insulting.  I'm just, you know, offering...  What else are you working on?  He's a doctor.  Right now, I'm working on Mami Kula Grande, which is...  Wait, wait.  Say that one more time.  Mami Kula Grande.  Mami Kula Grande.  You know how you see Mami, the little Latin girl, you know what I mean?  We call her Mommies, you know what I mean?  And the Kula is the ass.  The Kula is the ass, right?  And, you know, Grande is a big one, so now we got the big booty Latin girl line, you know, 
[02:50:30]  fatty girls, you know what I mean?  It was black girls.  So continuing on the large butt thing.  Big butt thing.  So I'm working on the big butt thing.  And then I'm finishing that up.  I also have my Black Pipe Blair movie coming out.  That's Black Pipe Blair.  That's one of my signature series where we just wrecked.  We just completely wrecked little white girls, you know.  DP, anal, just stretch them all open and see if they stop.  Explain, DP, because this is for XM Satellite Radio.  They might not necessarily understand what DP is.  All right, DP, that's a double penetration. 
[02:51:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, if you fuck a girl in her ass and her pussy at the same time.  You know what I mean?  That's what we do.  You know what I mean?  That sounds awfully painful.  I mean, you know, I don't know, you know, about pain and shit.  I ain't never experienced that shit.  Well, yeah, but if there's a girl, like, underneath, you know, screaming her head off.  Yeah, sometimes.  Yeah, but there's some girls that can take that shit.  There's some girls that want nothing under that.  You know what I mean?  We're dealing with, you know, professionals here.  This is a porno.  This is the motherfucking NBA, NFL, motherfucking freaks. 
[02:51:30]  You know what I'm saying?  There's some freaky shit going on.  So, you know.  Oh, what a despicable human being.  What an awful Negro.  We're going to wreck some white girls.  We're going to wreck some white girls.  That could be my favorite line that anybody has ever said.  Oh, my God.  We're going to wreck some white girls.  That's a more interesting and honest assessment of a film than you're ever going to hear out of Hollywood.  Exactly.  What are we going to get in your movie? 
[02:52:00]  Wrecked white girls.  Oh, we're really going to wreck some white girls.  We're really going to wreck some white girls.  What the hell?  What an awful man.  I love him.  But the girls line up for it.  The girls line up for it.  They get 15 new girls a week in this business.  Where are the fathers watching their little girls get DP'd by two big black men?  Sometimes two or three.  Two or three.  And double anal.  He talked about double anal.  One in the mouth.  Oh, here's double anal.  What an awful man.  Here's Steve C. talking to Justin Slayer about double anal, everyone. 
[02:52:30]  Did they ever do double anal?  You know what?  The chicks probably can do it.  But I don't particularly shoot it.  You know what I mean?  Because I don't particularly like that.  You know what I mean?  I shoot what I like.  And I don't like the double.  You know, DP is cool when he's the dick in the pussy and the dick in the ass and the dick in the mouth and all that shit.  But when too much dick close proximity and shit, you know what I mean?  That ain't good.  I mean, for me at least.  I don't like it.  You know what I mean? 
[02:53:00]  It might be good for somebody else, but I don't particularly like that.  So I don't shoot that, you know?  How do these guys keep a rod when they're rubbing up against each other like that?  I don't know, man.  You know, like, I only had, in my career, luckily, I only had to do one.  And I didn't keep a rod when I did it.  You know what I'm saying?  I lost my shit.  I almost lost my job, too.  They was kicking me out of porn.  They was like, this motherfucker can't perform, man.  You know?  But I was like, nah, man.  It was that other motherfucker that fucked me up.  You know what I mean?  What was he doing?  Nah, nah.  It's just I couldn't do it. 
[02:53:30]  You know what I mean?  I was like, you know, the shit fucked me up.  It was like some type of, you know.  It's like hovering into gay territory.  In my brain.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't.  Like, I'm positive he didn't get no enjoyment from me and I ain't get nothing from him.  But the shit, just the contact itself, like, it psychologically fucked me up.  So then I couldn't even, you know, even for two or three days after that at home, I couldn't even jack off and shit.  I think it was just, like, traumatized from that shit, man. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Could this man please ask Bernie Getz for five bucks?  This guy is awful.  Yo, man.  I couldn't keep my shit.  I almost lost my job.  James, you lost your job.  Oh.  Well, all right.  There's Justin Slayer, everyone.  What else we got on this tape?  Wrecking them white chicks. 
[02:54:30]  Does he have black chicks getting nailed by a black guy?  Or is it just white chicks?  Oh, yeah, no.  It's a whole big booty, you know, range of films.  Booty-licious.  Yeah.  He goes after the black girls, the white girls.  Now he's done the Latin girls.  Looks like a Wally.  So, yeah, he's not discriminating.  He'll just wreck anything.  Well, he said the first series he did was about big booty black girls and he wanted to go into the next genre.  Get some white chicks to wreck.  Wow.  What a freak show today.  We got Justin Slayer talking about double anal. 
[02:55:00]  We got Paris Hilton getting railed in the background here.  You might be hearing that at home.  Or in your truck.  You got to get rid of the night vision stuff.  That is not sexy.  It's really creepy when their eyes start glowing like you were saying earlier.  It's like you're watching a nature film.  It's like, you know, some kind of outdoor watching gorillas fuck thing.  She's getting railed pretty good, though.  Yeah, I've got to give Rick Solomon credit.  He's a professional.  She's kind of bruised up on the legs.  That's nice.  I like that.  It's hot. 
[02:55:30]  I talked during the game.  Fell down at the bar.  We threw an ashtray at her.  Move!  In front of the television.  All right.  What else we got?  We have Norton interviewing the Lowrider guys.  Oh, the Lowrider.  That was that, um...  Or the Joyrider.  What's it called?  Oh, there was two.  There was, uh...  You want to talk about it?  Nah, they're both just toilet.  But these are okay.  Where's the one where we're talking to this really, uh...  Big...  Oh.  The next two tracks.  Where's the flaming gay guy interview where I asked him about you and your shirt?  Oh, the flaming. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, dude.  There was a gay guy.  So you don't want to play the Lowrider guys?  I don't know if there's really anything there, to be honest.  Yeah.  What are they just describing?  The toilet seat that you liked?  Kind of a toilet on spring.  Yeah, that's actually more of a visual, because he had the actual...  You know what?  That's more of a visual.  We have video of Yoshi and Jimmy demonstrating how you would sit on a Lowrider and drop logs  onto somebody's head.  We'll use it.  We'll put it up on the website.  Yeah, there's really not much audio there.  All right.  Also, we have Tanya the transsexual.  That was that big, overbearing, huge one.  I want to hear the voice.  I don't know what the interview was. 
[02:56:30]  It was...  Oh, let's direct our attention to the TV.  Money shot?  No?  Oh, there's Paris asking if he's going to come.  Another ship.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't think he did.  I think he just stopped.  Wow.  Hey, how about that?  All right, they've stopped for a while.  So, Tanya the transsexual, we'll give this a shot? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, try it.  Okay.  What's your name?  My name is Tanya of tanyaworld.com.  That's T-O-N-Y-A-W-O-R-L-D.com.  Is this your first time at AVN?  No, I'm the very first transsexual from the internet.  I've been modeling since 94.  I've won several awards, and I've done hundreds of magazine covers.  Now I'm more or less in management, and I feature the new transsexuals of tomorrow.  So I've been at this quite a while.  Yeah.  What do you do?  Do guys ever mistake you for a woman and then don't know, and then you just don't tell them? 
[02:57:30]  No, no, no.  When that happens, I already go ahead and tell them.  If I realize they don't know, I say, look, honey, I'm not the girl for you.  And I make sure that maybe, you know, I use my normal voice.  I don't try to, hi, honey.  I don't try to do that.  You know, I'm just me.  And if they keep pursuing, I say, look, I'm not the kind of girl you're looking for, honey.  I keep telling them, and then they keep pursuing it and keep pursuing it.  And I go, well, I said, look, honey, I'm a transsexual, honey.  Now don't get offended because you got hot.  Now you find out, you know, because I don't do it like that. 
[02:58:00]  But nowadays where I live, I live in South Florida to where transgenderism is very accepted.  And people will just already know because the straight bars will advertise, well, tonight's training night.  And all the trainees will be up in a straight bar.  So they know they're training because they're done.  They look like celebrities.  They're no hips.  You know, they're done, you know.  Now do most guys just want to have sex?  What is it?  Are they exploring something?  Most guys have realized that they love women.  Cocks are optional.  A lot of men have realized that a lot of women nowadays are born with penises. 
[02:58:30]  And there's no point in finding one of these women that like to strap it on and carry on and do all that madness when you can go see a transsexual and, you know, hang out with a girl that has working equipment and don't have to take it off and all that crap.  And a true transsexual is soft from head to toe.  There's no manly features because she's born a transsexual and she grows up as a woman.  She don't grow up as a boy.  See, the real goof in this is you kind of have to see this one.  Because I say, like, you know, like at one point, like you're convincing as a woman and this is the most unconvincing transsexual ever. 
[02:59:00]  And that's kind of the goof in that one is you have to see.  We have a video of it.  I won't put the video.  Oh, my God.  Middle, it looked like an old man with a lot of bad plastic surgery.  The lips were all puffed up but unevenly puffed up.  It's almost like a cleft palate at one point.  Nice.  Yeah, you have to kind of see it.  That's why you keep feeding questions.  I'm not the girl for you, honey.  Like, what guy would even think that that wasn't a tranny?  Exactly.  Well, that was why I said, do guys ever not know?  Right.  Because it was so obvious that you could know from across the street. 
[02:59:30]  Honey.  All right.  Well, what about the Sergio Rio?  Oh, Sergio Rio.  That was when we were walking around the gay part of the Adult Expo.  And there was a guy, he looked like he was probably 40 years old, but he was dressed in  like leather straps and a thong.  So we walked up to him to find out what he was all about.  God.  Truly awful.  Yeah, it was really.  He was truly awful. 
[03:00:00]  Big furry guy.  So we had Jimmy in, ask him a few questions.  So what's your name?  My name is Sergio Rio.  And you're with Old Man Studios.  Old Man Studios, yeah.  I have done two movies for them.  Let me ask you a question.  Honestly, would his shirt go well in one of your films?  Maybe a four scene.  After everything has to come off. 
[03:00:30]  But it's not bad.  It's cool.  It's cool.  I used to have a motorcycle, so this would go well.  The people tell him that those shirts look like they would be perfect in the gay community  and he doesn't believe it and he wears them anyway.  And I'm going to knock on the shirts, they're nice shirts, but do you think that those shirts  would be popular in the gay community?  Not in the gay community.  Well, for young guys in the gay community, possibly, yeah, yeah.  Could be cool.  But in general, no.  I won that one.  I know you didn't.  He's saying that older gay men would find them tacky, but younger gay guys would probably 
[03:01:00]  think they're cool and hip.  Thank you very much.  The gay community is very, very big, so it's very, you know, diversified.  So there's a test for everything.  So there's a section that probably would like that.  Now, what would he be considered in the gay community?  Like, what would he be considered as far as, you know, everybody has a name.  Like, what would he be considered?  Well, he would be, he would do very well in the leather community, because it's mainly  about big guys, hairy guys, and he would be considered a bear. 
[03:01:30]  And then, you know, he would be bigger than that.  Now, who would be attracted to bears?  Bears.  Bears usually are attracted to bears.  Now, what are cubs?  We've heard that name, cubs.  Um, it's possible, but he's kind of a too sweet face for a cup, so.  So his too sweet face is perfect for a bear, but not a cup.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bear would be more cozy. 
[03:02:00]  More appropriated for him.  Do you think he's cozy?  Well, his face, his very friendly face, his expression is very friendly, so.  Which name's what I call cozy?  My name is Sergio Real.  Sergio Real.  Oh, my God, is that funny.  A bear.  I just like the fact that he called Steve cozy.  Cozy.  Steve's cozy.  Steve's cozy.  I don't know.  That whole bear thing.  Couple of big, hairy guys just hugging.  Just awful.  Oh. 
[03:02:30]  Two big bears.  The whole time we're doing this, Jim is just giggling like a schoolgirl.  Of course.  Oh.  It was.  Putting cock in their mouth like salmon jumping out of a stream.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Pulling them out of flies with their big claws.  Arr.  Oh.  Big bear.  Hairy.  Steve.  Steve cozy from foundrymusic.com.  Oh.  Oh.  That's awful. 
[03:03:00]  Oh.  That's truly awful.  Hello, I'm Winnie the Pooh.  Who are you?  I'm not gay.  I'm just cozy.  Put some honey on that cock, Tigger.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, that is great.  A big bear.  Ugh.  Ooh.  Yum.  Awful.  All right.  Well, we're going to step aside and regroup.  My goodness.  We did this already.  I don't even know what this is.  A little of a gee.  I have no idea what this sounds like today. 
[03:03:30]  We're giddy.  All right.  How about a mashup as we go to break?  Haven't played one in a while.  We got the Beatles and Nine Inch Nails getting together for this little ditty.  We'll be right back. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Help me.  I broke apart my insides.  Help me.  I've got no soul to tell.  Help me.  The only thing that works for me.  Help me get away from myself. 
[03:04:30]  God, I'm fucking over me.  God, I'm fucking over me.  God, I'm fucking over me.  God.  We'll be right back. 
[03:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:05:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:07:30]  We'll be right back.

[03:10:00]  XM satellite radio.  Radio to the power of X.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  XM 202.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific. 
[03:10:30]  Okay, terrific.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Okay, terrific.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  All right.  Got a few updates.  Wow.  Because this show is a soap opera.  We know that.  Yeah.  The saga that is Frankie Blue is over, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Is over.  Hopefully we replayed the Frankie Blue stuff in some of the worst of in the past few days. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah, we did.  We did?  Thursday.  Oh, good.  So a lot of people know what we're talking about here, then.  Because we got a lot of new listeners through the holiday.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue, baby.  Frankie blew up his spot there at NEW.  Blue, you're my boy!  You're my boy, Blue.  Thanks for all the great radio.  Sorry you got fired.  You're my boy, Blue!  You're my boy, Blue.  You're my boy.  I don't have one today. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, hold on.  Well, because I'm using your thing for this.  Yeah.  For the porno.  Hold on.  Now you're back.  You're fired!  Blue, you're my boy!  You're fired!  You're my boy, Blue!  So you want to explain Frankie Blue really fast, Anthony?  Yeah, Frankie Blue was the program director, you know, the boss over there at the station  we used to work at, WNEW in New York.  And they do like, what would you call that music? 
[03:12:00]  Music that gay guys play when they're having sex?  Yeah, you could call it that.  I don't know what it is.  I think that dance type music, and like music that dopey chicks put on in their car all  the time.  Just that crap.  What's a good example?  Like a song that they would play?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to like, so people get the grasp of the type of station it is to know that  it's not like this, where you could come on drunk, people have, you know, and get away 
[03:12:30]  with it.  It's not that type of thing.  It's very fast delivery that the jocks give.  And Frankie Blue was at a Christmas party.  Got a little tanked, it seemed.  Went back to his station and got in a little argument with the girl that was supposed to  be coming on the air.  And that's what they're saying he got fired for.  Right.  It's just for the argument.  But he figures now she's gone.  And he threw her out of there that day.  Now he was going to take to the airwaves and show the talent that is Frankie Blue, all hammered 
[03:13:00]  from the Christmas party.  He gets on just slurring and stumbling through the show that he was doing.  And then I think the worst thing I think that he did, he called WNEW WKTU, which is the  competitor of the station.  So it kind of, it really looked bad.  You're not supposed to be the boss doing that.  And at the time, we got a hold of this tape and exploited it to the max. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, of course we did.  And now there's radio guys all over the country that have copies of this and they're playing  it for each other.  They think it's one of the greatest things ever.  I've talked to more radio guys that said, oh my God, I'm sending this to everybody.  And all the guys in radio were playing it and listening to it like it was the funniest  thing ever.  Yeah.  Because we love when people screw up.  Especially when it has something to do with our old station.  Yep.  Another program director losing his job at our old station.  Yeah.  They've been through a lot of them since we left it.  It's been an abomination since they unjustly booted you guys. 
[03:14:00]  That is correct, sir.  An abomination in the biggest radio market in the country.  Yeah.  And that station has been an abomination for the last two and a half years.  You wouldn't see a station this screwed up in a 200 market.  You wouldn't see it.  And this is the number one market in the country and it has been just a mess for years.  A legendary station.  After the music went down, they put you guys on and you're the only thing on the station 
[03:14:30]  and then Ron and Fez start to do very well.  Of course there's no morning show because they don't want to compete with Howard in New York.  So they put nothing on in the morning.  It's just an embarrassment, man.  It has been.  And the revolving door of program directors that have gone through there.  If you take that gig, you're insane because you're not going to be the one that straightens it out.  There is no quick fix for that place and they're not in it for the long haul.  So you're just done. 
[03:15:00]  There's no quick fix.  But they don't want to wait for a longer solution to take place.  So they just keep firing the people that can't fix it quick enough.  Or they get drunk on the air.  At least that was an original firing.  The past bosses or program directors that have been through there have been fired because it just hasn't worked out.  They can't get the station going.  And now they got some new guy.  I thought Steve had gotten a new job over at NEW when I read this.  It says Martini returns to NEW as PD. 
[03:15:30]  It's Rick Martini, I guess.  I thought they meant Martini Steve.  Yeah, Rick Martini.  A 25-year radio veteran.  Did a lot with his career, obviously.  You know what's wrong with 25-year radio veterans?  He's going to bring nothing new to NEW.  Nothing new.  A 25-year veteran uses all the stuff he's learned over 25 years, which is the same old crap that no one wants to listen to.  It's not new.  It's not cutting edge. 
[03:16:00]  It's not something people are going to tune into and go, wow, this is something.  I've got to hear this.  Because they'll hear it elsewhere.  No one's going to switch.  If you could go to KTU, say, which is the other station that plays this kind of crap.  Do we have one of those songs?  Do we actually have one?  They play this?  Are you kidding me?  Isn't this Donna Summer?  Donna Summer.  Last dance.  Hey, baby.  It's Frankie Blue.  It's Donna Summer. 
[03:16:30]  And we're going to listen to this last dance.  Last dance, Earl.  Dance with me, Earl.  You're working my board for me today.  It's Frankie Blue, baby.  Let me tell you something.  We're here at WKY.  W-Y.  Right, yeah.  KTU.  Where are we?  Any double dip or double shit?  W-L-S-T.  Oh, no.  That's what I took before I came in.  W.  Give me another drink here.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  W-E-E-E. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, no.  That's something else I took before I came in today.  I'm sorry.  Frankie Blue, baby.  You know, this is a Christmas party I won't forget very soon.  A Christmas party that got me fired.  And I didn't even copy my sack and asshole in the copy machine.  And I still got in trouble for a Christmas party.  Frankie Blue?  Why?  Well, I needed the money.  Oh, that's terrific.  Frankie Blue in there.  I'll tell you.  That's terrific.  Frankie Blue his job up.  Welcome to WHIV.  Wait, wait.  That's just people that enjoy this music. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  Let's dance, baby.  Let's dance.  Hey, I just said that.  I'd like to take Donna Summer and fuck Donna Summer.  Donna Summer.  Yeah, here on KZU.  We got our big contest going.  We're going to win a Sky On.  What are we winning?  I don't know.  Tune in to Frankie Blue for the next five minutes because that's all I'll be here before they throw my drunk ass out.  And RuPaul's going to take his big manly hands and reach into Donna Summer's box. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, what a mess he was that day.  I'm going to do a little riff, you know, because I'm Frankie Blue.  And, you know, we got RuPaul in here.  I was in the bathroom.  What a huge horse cock on that black guy.  Let me tell you.  What a huge horse cock.  What?  Are we on the arrow?  Uh-oh.  And, you know, the station, the on-air talent, did not address it honestly.  You know they didn't goof on it once it happened. 
[03:18:30]  Just don't talk about it.  Just pretend it didn't happen.  Make believe it didn't happen until we fire you.  That's pretty much what radio does.  Well, because we said it earlier.  I mean, they've taken the fun out of radio.  Everyone has taken this whole thing so seriously.  No spontaneity.  It's just radio.  It's the stupidest job in America.  Yeah.  And no one has a sense of humor anymore.  If this happens on your radio station, you've got to go with it.  I agree with you, baby.  Frankie Blue agrees with you.  Corporate people are talentless, humorless faggots, and they ruin everything they touch  that is creative. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Every time corporations get involved with creativity, you ruin it.  Shut up!  Oh, sorry.  Try to soak everybody.  Router!  Flashback.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, baby.  On the new KTU.  How long has this station been around?  Why do we still call it new?  Frankie Blue here.  Get me another goddamn drink.  Woo!  Blue, you're my boy.  Oh, that's me.  You're not funny.  You're not interesting.  And that's why when things like this happen, you don't know what to do with it.  You just clam up and pretend it didn't happen. 
[03:19:30]  Fire it.  96 was when they were the new KTU.  All right.  They still call themselves the new.  So there's the Frankie Blue update.  He got fired for the audio we're about to play.  So he yells and screams at the poor girl that was supposed to be in the air, whatever  her name is.  She's some legend, too, I guess.  Whatever.  Whatever.  She's still got a job there?  I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, you bet she does.  I thought maybe they'd just eliminate the entire problem.  You know, sometimes just flush it out, make like it never happened.  We don't have to look at her.  We don't have to think about him. 
[03:20:00]  You know, they kind of do that sometimes.  But I'm sure she would sue.  Oh, yeah.  And probably rightfully so.  Someone said he manhandled her.  I don't know if he did or not.  He shoved her out.  I have some respect for him now.  I would, too.  Show her who's boss.  Something he used to be.  He thought he was big enough.  Show her who used to be boss.  He thought he was big enough to go on the air and do a radio shift.  And we got our hands on the audio.  Yeah, baby.  Here's Frankie Blue blowing up his career, baby.  There it is.  End of the year.  I love this song. 
[03:20:30]  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash in the Mix 1027 redo.  And plus win a Toyota Scion. 
[03:21:00]  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like publishing clearance.  Oh, whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you. 
[03:21:30]  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 in a brand new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m., 50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  That's terrific.  That's right.  That's terrific.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion. 
[03:22:00]  Come on, come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick a winner, and we're going to find you.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right.  We have the armored truck. 
[03:22:30]  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And the telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-922-9222.  And mix 1027.  You're just a tool.  Okay, baby.  Thank you.  He's the boss. 
[03:23:00]  I can't get past that.  Okay, baby.  And I don't know anybody who would not want to do this.  What a drunk.  Dude, we are really lucky that Earl got us that thing.  That is so cool.  Black Earl.  Earl, you got us the tape, right?  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Oh, he doesn't know anything about it.  Denying it to the end.  All right, Earl.  And then here's the second part that we have where he basically, we're not sure if he wants  to fuck the winner of this contest or if he was hiccuping. 
[03:23:30]  And then he's using the wrong call letters for his radio station.  And he's the boss, man.  This is the one that doomed him, by the way, I think, right?  The first half, he could have survived.  And at the time, Ant and I were like, he is more fired than fired.  He's so fired.  So completely fired that you are fired before anyone even knows you're fired.  So fired.  This is just all about being so fired.  So completely and thoroughly fired.  And he did get fired while we were in Vegas.  But this is what did him in. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I agree with Jim.  We know how they work over there.  The other one, you could get behind closed doors to yell at you like, what are you doing,  you idiot?  We know how they operate over there.  Me and Opie are the pros of knowing when you're fired.  We just know.  We know when other jocks do things, like we'll read it on the internet or something or in  the paper, some jock screws up in some market out in the Midwest.  And me and Opie are on the phone with each other just going, dude, did you read that?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, fired.  So fired.  This guy is so fired. 
[03:24:30]  And you're reading the paper.  No, they just removed him from the air, suspended him.  They said for a week.  And me and Opie are like, fired.  Fired.  Fired.  So fired.  And at the end of the week, fired.  So fired.  We know.  So here it is.  This is what doomed him.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Oh. 
[03:25:00]  Coming in in the morning.  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and.  Picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest.  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull. 
[03:25:30]  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  Okay.  Terrific.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027.  Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening to you.  Bye-bye.  I can't wait till tomorrow.  Oh.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  What was that?  How drunk do you have to be when you're doing the Foster Brooks impression? 
[03:26:00]  Tomorrow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Dean.  What a mess.  That got him thrown right out.  Zor.  So.  That's the end of that soap opera.  Frankie Blue is done.  Frankie Blue.  We've been having so much fun with that audio too, man.  It's one of my favorite things.  You know, you would think that we would have some sympathy.  But when people get booted for doing stupid stuff on the air, me and I'll be the first 
[03:26:30]  ones to laugh and go, what an idiot.  Yeah.  That must be what it's like when we get fired for everyone else.  What a couple of jack-offs.  Listen to these idiots.  Of course.  Sex and the church.  Ha-ha.  Everyone in Vegas knew about us too.  Oh, I know.  The blackjack dealer.  Yeah.  The people at the table.  Like, oh.  What did she say?  It's something she said to me like, oh, you should be in radio with that voice.  And we all started laughing.  Yeah.  Because I was imitating Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  So she's like, wow.  What's so funny about that? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, my God.  So then she never heard our radio show, but she heard what we did.  Somebody blurted out, oh, it's Opie and Anthony.  And then people at the table are like, oh, yeah, I know you guys.  The church, right?  Yeah.  The church.  Infamous, they call it.  Infamy.  One other thing that happened, Anthony, while we were in Vegas, trying to get through some  of the, some old business, and it ends another soap opera in a way.  Ashley Simpson.  Mm-hmm.  The whole SNL thing.  People thought she was going to survive that. 
[03:27:30]  You know, the lip syncing and all that.  She is awful.  She's a complete phony.  What's that?  She didn't win any Golden Globes, did she?  What?  Or People's Choice Award.  Did she win a People's Choice Award?  Oh, you saw that mess last night?  Oh, I was watching that clusterfuck last night.  What a mess.  Rewarding that garbage.  So.  And it's, you know something?  You realize how, like, the Oscars and the Grammys and the Emmys are voted on by a board 
[03:28:00]  of professionals that look at it and try to figure out what makes it better.  One film or musician better than another and doesn't, you might not always agree, but  with these People's Choice Awards, you just look and it's every bit of fluff and crap  that the nation has been fed through Entertainment Weekly Magazine and these dopey news shows.  And it's every bit they've been brainwashed.  And that's what they vote on.  That's what they vote on. 
[03:28:30]  And that, oh, oh, wait on my board.  I got off.  Paris Hilton giving head.  And now maybe she really is watching.  That is really interesting.  The blowjob is an award-winning blowjob.  Look at that.  And the girl knows how to suck some cock.  Talking about Paris Hilton.  That really was a hot scene with everybody showing.  Well, anyway.  So, yeah, the people.  Oh, so it was just, yeah.  It's everything.  Like, okay, boy, who's going to win for, and it was some dopey category, best smile. 
[03:29:00]  Like, what celebrity has the best smile?  And you know who they give it to?  Who do they always give it to?  Julia Roberts.  Of course.  I was a guess.  Of course.  Because you've been, like, fed it.  The nation thinks, Julia Roberts has the best smile ever because I've been told so.  And you look at her smile.  It's like she got too many teeth in her mouth, you know?  You know who I think has a better smile? 
[03:29:30]  Rick Solomon, as he's watching this whore service him.  Really?  I really love Rick Solomon after this.  I love him.  She is going to town on that thing.  It's very hot.  I've got to be honest.  This is a very sexy video.  Slurp, slurp.  There she goes.  Paris Hilton.  Yes.  Very nice.  I've got a better camera shot than that.  All Rick will do it.  So anyway, the Ashley Simpson.  Yeah.  You know, she messed up on SNL.  We all know that.  And then she had to blame the band at the end.  I think we got a quick audio clip of that. 
[03:30:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, what can I say?  Live TV.  Exactly.  I feel so bad my band started playing the wrong song.  And I know excuse about that.  I do a hoedown.  I'm sorry.  She said so.  So what happened was, you know, Ashley Simpson got caught lip syncing, but they pretty much  all do it.  Nothing was better than her uncomfortably doing that pee-pee dance on the stage on SNL, knowing  that she was just caught in a horrific moment of her career. 
[03:30:30]  And just the fact that self-centered bitch would blame the band.  Yeah.  God almighty, is that revolting.  Well, then she had to go out and prove to everyone that she could sing.  Yes.  Well, the folks at the Orange Bowl didn't really appreciate Ashley Simpson singing.  No.  And no, no, no, no.  And we got some audio of them pretty much booing her off the stage.  Ooh.  Listen to this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You made me want.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You made me want.  La, la, la, la, la. 
[03:31:00]  You made me want.  What?  Hey.  Hey.  Wow.  Oh.  Kelly Clarkson, Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson, part of our halftime show at the FedEx Orange  Bowl.  Completely booed her.  And of course.  Bravo to everyone that was at the Orange Bowl.  Scumbag announcer, typical of television, doesn't acknowledge the truth. 
[03:31:30]  No.  Hey, if they give him a hand from the Orange Bowl.  Why would they go?  Oh, my God.  They really didn't enjoy that piece of crap, did they?  Why is there no honesty from people?  None.  None.  Make believe it's not happening.  La, la, la, la.  It is not happening.  Did you hear how horrific she sounded?  She's terrible.  Yeah.  The voice is cracking.  They stop and booed her.  It was a huge stadium full of people booing.  No way to cover that up.  I wonder how Daddy's going to get her out of that one. 
[03:32:00]  Daddy, do something.  Maybe 50,000 people had acid reflux.  They were all going, eeeeh.  Oh.  Isn't that great?  That is fantastic.  I love when that happens.  Hell yeah.  Do you want to hear it again?  I'd love to.  I'm going to hear a bad singing.  Oh, la, la, la, la.  You made me want.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You made me want.  La, la, la, la.  Ah.  Hey. 
[03:32:30]  Kelly.  Kelly.  Kelly Clarkson, Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson, part of our halftime show at the FedEx Orange Bowl.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Kelly Clarkson.  I'm here at the Venetian.  We're interviewing Buttman.  Phony voice. 
[03:33:00]  Kelly Clarkson.  Kelly Clarkson.  Ashley Simpson being booed to tears.  You got to feel bad for Kelly Clarkson who can sing.  And who is the other one?  Trace Adkins, I don't know who that is.  Can she sing?  He.  He?  A country singer?  Well, it's not our forte.  That's great.  But two real singers and this TV incarnate brat.  Yeah.  Why would you throw her on with two real talented people?  Because that is the type of clean, wholesome entertainment that you want during football games. 
[03:33:30]  You don't want surprises like tits popping out.  This is what you're going to get.  This is going to infuriate you more.  So I got the story in front of me.  Ashley Simpson booted at Orange Bowl.  We didn't get to read a lot of papers while we were in Vegas.  We were too busy doing I don't know what.  Read the papers.  They say that an elephant never forgets and apparently neither does the American public.  Ashley Simpson was booed by 72,000 people at the conclusion.  72,000.  Jimmy, have you ever bombed one night where you felt really, really bad about your performance? 
[03:34:00]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  How many people would you say is the most you've ever tanked in front of?  A couple of hundred.  A couple of hundred?  I've been booed in front of almost 5,000, but I wound up winning them over.  Oh, nice.  That was opening for Dice.  Yeah, that's a hard gig.  But just to hear that many is frightening.  Crushing.  It's overwhelming to hear that many people booing.  How many thousand was that opening?  72,000.  Remember, 72,000 people booed at the conclusion of her performance during the halftime show 
[03:34:30]  at the Orange Bowl, okay?  Love it.  Ironically, Simpson chose not to use a background track.  However, choosing to sing live didn't work out for Ashley in the end.  A very obvious chorus of booze could be heard throughout the Orange Bowl in Miami as the  fireworks erupted and Simpson's song came to an end Tuesday night.  Ready for this?  Quote?  Orange Bowl representative said they were pleased with Simpson's performance and feel the booing  was just backlash from her Saturday Night Live lip syncing incident. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, God, trying to wash that over.  They were pleased.  You could hear for yourself how bad the singing was.  Pleasure.  Dishonest corporate scumbags keep walking around and lying, lying, lying.  Can one of these people tell the truth?  No.  Yeah, that kind of stunk.  Yeah.  Yeah, she really didn't sound good, and the people let her know it.  They just didn't like it.  Orange Bowl representatives were pleased at this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You made me walk. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You made me walk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You made me walk.  Free.  Oh.  Kelly.  Kelly Clarkson, Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson, part of our halftime show.  Part of our halftime show.  Hey, part of our halftime show. 
[03:36:00]  How do you?  Oh.  Who is not going to talk like that?  They're not booing.  They're just yelling, Lou, Lou.  I don't know who Lou is, but isn't that funny when the sportscasters have to say that?  When it's like a sports figure and the name is Lou or something like that.  Lou, Lou.  Lou, Lou.  Just chanting Lou.  Okay, pookie.  Boo the whore.  Okay.  What a mess.  What a mess. 
[03:36:30]  You make me wanna jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Maybe they were all just yelling Jew in honor of her agent.  Jew.  She'll now go away.  You think that's it, right?  Oh, they weren't booing.  They were yelling crew because it was like the end of the longest yard.  Oh, very nice.  Right.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  It's not 72,000 people booing her.  Why would they do that?  I think you're right, though.  That's gotta be the end.  This is one you can't recover from because, again, they gave her the second shot live. 
[03:37:00]  It was okay.  But this is an embarrassment.  We'll see what daddy does to get her out of this one.  Nothing.  Nothing he can do.  So sit back and look at your hot sister and those big boobs of hers.  Oh, yeah.  And realize you have nothing to offer anyone.  I would love to be backstage and hear the nonsense they fed her to comfort her.  Don't you love the little notes Eric writes in a handwriting that is incomprehensible?  And he's incomprehensible.  And he's shaking.  He holds up these notes. 
[03:37:30]  Are you nervous or do you have Parkinson's?  I try to read them.  I really do, Eric.  And I look and I go, what is it?  Is that Chinese?  You don't know.  All you do is you hear.  And then you look over.  You're like, what does that say?  And just shakes it off politely.  I think I've known your handwriting is a little.  It's a little hard to read.  A little.  A little.  He works really hard, though.  Boo!  Boo!  For that handwriting.  Boo! 
[03:38:00]  Oh, how great.  You know what?  The American public can be really stupid, but you've got to give them credit once in a while.  We make the right decision.  They come through.  72 grand of them come through.  And had she sang well, had she been good and they realized, wow, I bet you they would have given her a standing ovation.  Like, wow, she kicked ass.  Yeah, we understood she over.  Because the American public, look, we love the underdog.  We really do.  We love to see somebody screw up and then come back.  Persevere.  People like that.  Come back from adversity.  But, man.  We love the comeback.  But when you tank, I think better than a comeback, we love seeing someone crash and burn. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, the only thing that could have made me happier is if that happened to her at the Apollo.  That's the only thing that could have pleased me more.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Jumping on stage and beating her with fists.  All right.  I guess we have more audio of Ashley Simpson.  Yeah.  Actually, no.  It's Lyndon McCartney.  One of our, another one of our favorite things.  Oh, this audio?  No, no, no, no, no.  God, that is so hot.  Yeah.  Now it's the color.  Oh.  Wow.  But that's what all the porn should look like. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, this scene is in color.  It's Paris Hilton going down on Rick.  She really has him worked up.  Dude, I got it.  Yeah, but, you know, like, they're both, like, that's what you should be doing in a  porn on Movie Made at Home.  Not some handheld nonsense.  Set the camera off.  He's holding on to the boys like a doorknob.  She's a good girl.  I got to respect her for this.  This is what she should be doing in life.  Yeah.  Mom and Dad worked hard, built an empire, and this is what you do.  In one of their hotel rooms, this is what should be happening.  Yeah, a sweet hotel suite.  A hotel suite.  That's not a rule.  That's a two-bedroom suite.  Yeah.  She is so hot, man. 
[03:39:30]  She is ridiculously hot.  They overprotected her as a child, I'm sure.  Gave her the best schooling.  Oh, and look where she is.  And here she is.  Here's your little girl.  And ta-da!  There she is.  Good job, Mom and Dad.  Good job.  You did it.  You don't see the Sheraton's daughter doing that, do you?  Oh, you don't even see the Super 8's kid is well-behaved.  What did she say now?  She said something crazy there.  Oh, all right.  She likes sucking. 
[03:40:00]  God, her technique is fantastic.  And the beauty of being this guy is you know he can bang any chick he wants now,  because chicks love when they know you've had a hot girl before them.  So all these dumbbells are lining up.  Famous lung now.  All right.  Working it with one hand.  And she's got the hand cup in the bag.  And you know she's probably doing the little tickle.  You ever get the hand cup and the little, almost like it's a billy goat's chin.  Oh, God.  Oh, there you go. 
[03:40:30]  My only criticism, she pulls her rich face away before the man is finished.  Yeah, come on.  There was the money shot.  Good job, Paris.  Good job.  Nice.  Come on.  Making the sounds of Stop It Already.  Yeah.  That was hot.  What did she say there?  I don't know.  She needs one of those pleasure wipes.  And there's the camera off. 
[03:41:00]  Very nice.  I guess that's the end right there.  I've got to get a copy of that.  That's really, really hot.  All right.  As we go to break, it's actually another piece of audio we really love here.  The Linda McCartney backing track.  Oh, the backing tracks of Linda McCartney.  Are you sure this is really her and not a goof?  Oh, it is.  Absolutely.  No, this thing has been going around forever.  Yep.  Some sound man.  Some disgruntled sound man.  Yeah, it's like, oh, my God.  I can't believe that Paul's allowing her to sing backup through these Beatles songs when  he was doing the Wings thing.  Everything is mic'd separately.  So her mic would go into the board, and the guy could isolate just her track and have 
[03:41:30]  the other music real low and record that.  So that's what he did.  And in the mix that goes out to the crowd, she would be pulled way down, so the crowd  wouldn't hear her singing this awful mess.  Right.  But then he recorded her and let it out, and now it's everywhere.  Yeah.  Really fast, though.  Eric in New York City.  What's up, Eric?  Good morning, guys.  I'm away from my ex-emps this morning, so I'm listening to Howard.  He's doing an infomercial for you again.  Oh, really?  What is he saying today?  He doesn't care.  Again, he doesn't care about us? 
[03:42:00]  He doesn't care so much that he just keeps talking about us.  God.  Obviously, he didn't prepare for another radio show once again.  I don't care.  We just talking about him on the air, and then he said, there's a lot of guys busting  my balls, and Artie says, who do you think?  So he starts talking about Freed, and he doesn't care.  He just doesn't care.  Thank you, Eric.  Okay, guys.  Bye, sweetie.  Dude, we have jet lag.  We traveled all day yesterday, and we're giving our listeners some kind of radio show 
[03:42:30]  today.  He gave up so long ago, it's not even funny, and now he's just coming up with excuses  why he can't do a radio show.  He'll blame Freed.  He'll blame Bush.  He'll blame this.  He'll blame that.  I just don't care.  Yeah, where's the I don't care thing?  I don't care.  Hold on.  I don't care.  I'll be an Anthony.  I don't care.  Yeah, you don't care.  Shut up.  Just wasting time. 
[03:43:00]  That's all he's doing.  Instead of trying to do a clever, entertaining, funny show, he'll just waste time talking about  everybody that is preventing him from doing a clever, entertaining, and funny show.  Freed.  That's the reason.  They replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know, like, their...  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, well, I don't even know why they're...  I don't...  I said, this doesn't...  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony.  I don't...  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, well, I don't care.  They think I give a crap.  I don't care. 
[03:43:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Why would I care?  I don't care.  I said, this doesn't...  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, well, I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.
