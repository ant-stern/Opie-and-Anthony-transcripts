<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Live broadcast, hosted by Sam Roberts with E-Rock and Travis, began with a guest appearance by DJ Who Kid.  He discussed his work with 50 Cent,  the possibility of being replaced by Pauly D, and shared explicit and racially charged jokes about his touring experiences with 50 Cent, specifically focusing on his encounters with women of various ethnic backgrounds.  These anecdotes included sexually explicit descriptions and offensive racial humor regarding sexual acts and body parts.

The conversation then pivoted to Opie's recent vacation, detailing a bizarre underwater altercation with a French scuba diver. Opie recounted a slow-motion underwater fistfight resulting from repeated collisions with the diver.  A caller then contributed a similar story, escalating the violence with the added detail of ripping off the other diver's oxygen tank.

The show transitioned into a discussion of Patrice O'Neal's "rock coat" bit, a darkly humorous routine about disposing of bodies at sea. This prompted conversations about murders committed on cruise ships, complete with morbid and humorous speculation on methods and disguises for committing such crimes. A Coast Guard caller offered a real-life perspective, recounting the challenges of recovering bodies from the ocean.

Announcements were made regarding upcoming guests, including "Mob Wives" and potentially others.  A contest for the "most annoying 30 seconds" sound clip was also promoted.  The return of Ron Bennington to the show was teased.  The broadcast concluded with final remarks and promotional information for the Opie and Anthony show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is After O.N.A. Live. Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You betcha. It's After O.B. and Anthony Live. I'm Sam Roberts.  O.B. and Anthony are gone. Anthony's back.  It was a big, big show. Anthony's been gone for the last two weeks.  He's back, but he's not back anymore. He's gone again.  But he'll be back tomorrow morning.  E-Rock, me, Travis, all of us, we're all still here.  But just as they were leaving, I saw our pal from Shave 45, 50 Cent's personal DJ. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  DJ Who Kid.  I don't know if I'm his personal DJ anymore.  I heard about that. I heard that he's hiring Pauly D from Jersey Shore.  And Pauly D is not a rapper. He's a DJ.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you do.  So is 50 Cent, is he hiring him for an album, or is he taking Pauly D on the road with him and just leaving you behind?  I think Pauly D is going to be on the road with him and everything.  And so if he does that, does that mean eventually Pauly D comes in here and starts hosting on Saturdays and interviewing people? 
[00:01:00]  Does that make you insecure when you're hearing news that 50 Cent is hiring people and you're like, what? This is my gig.  When Pauly D gets a good smack for messing up on stage, that's going to be a good look.  That's why I'm waiting for him to fuck up on stage.  I see you when MTV re-airs the 50 Cent Cribs, I always see your part with the G-Unit chain under the cushion sofa.  I actually have that. If you want me to bring it over here, I could bring it to the show. 
[00:01:30]  Bring it in.  Put it on an Opie on one of them.  Yeah, they would like it.  That'd be kind of hot.  A little spinner for them.  But that doesn't make you worried?  Like, everything could start to fade away because 50 Cent is looking for the next hot thing and Pauly D is all over Jersey Shore?  I mean, what can I do, man? You know, the times are taking over now.  You just have to deal with it.  You know, and then Opie just saw me with a Jewish chick with big boobs. That's why he threw me in here.  Did you hear him? Because today's Passover. That's why we brought you in.  Oh, that's why he threw me in here.  We brought you in to celebrate Passover. 
[00:02:00]  Are you serious?  We weren't sure who we could get, but since we figured DJ Who Kid, he's a guy who's a celebration.  Yeah, and a master of interracial lust.  Interracial, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, you always say black on the outside, but white on the inside.  Yeah, no, I'm a mulatto right now.  You've been with a lot of women.  Of course.  You've toured the world with 50 Cent.  Yes.  I'm sure that you've, uh, been with your share of Jewish women.  A lot of, uh, Jewish fallopian tubes. A lot of happy Hanukkahs going down.  I can tell you about it.  Because he asked me, can, you know, my chick open her shirt? And then she did. 
[00:02:30]  She did.  Yeah, because Opie said that the thing about Jewish women, very large breasts and tiny  nipples, like a, like a watermelon with just a watermelon seed on the end.  Like, in your, in your experience.  Uh, well, the color is basically the same. It's not separated.  You know, when you see...  That's what he said.  When you see a black chick boob, it's just, look like a, uh, like, you know, I don't know,  like a prune, like...  Okay, the nipple part, you mean? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, the nipple part is kind of pruney and with a, with a thick, you know, plummy brown  color.  Right.  I'm trying to explain it the best way I can here.  Each woman.  It's all beige.  You're saying it's just beige.  There's no...  Beige, that's it.  There's nothing else.  Coloring of the nipple.  And then, I don't know where to suck. I don't know which part...  Right, you just, you gotta, it's like braille.  It's what you gotta, right, you just gotta use your hands.  You can't understand where the nipple starts or where the nipple ends.  Which is, which is, I don't understand how babies grow, like, these babies, because you're  supposed to, like, breastfeed.  Where does the baby latch on? 
[00:03:30]  Even they can't find it.  Oh, man.  But you, uh, you also, you said last time you were on ONA, it was a while back, you made  headlines with the, uh, Eminem Mariah Carey story.  Did Eminem tell you anything about Mariah's nipples ever?  That's something that we should get out there, you know?  I wonder, you know, he never really talked about it.  He would know, though, wouldn't he?  He just talked about the fallopian tube.  Never really...  He's familiar with that area.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  The inner love hole.  You know, where Nick Cannon is entering now.  And twins are coming out, or did they come out yet? 
[00:04:00]  I don't think they've come out yet, but...  The twins are still in there?  Did you see Mariah's nude, uh, photo on a magazine?  Like, she was on In Touch, I think, nude, very pregnant, with, like, Nick Cannon on it.  I think my penis was, like, not circumcised.  It just shrunk.  It was just in a calm moment.  When I saw that naked photo, I was like, what is going on here?  Why would she do that?  So you think Eminem got in while the getting was good, and right now it's kind of...  Well, he did say he did a baby shower during that week.  I don't know.  You don't know what kind of shower it was? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know if he re-entered her in.  You're going to get yourself in trouble.  She's in Mariah's scary right now.  Weren't you getting text messages from Nick Cannon last time you did this?  Also, before we go on to the, uh, to, to an, oh, and anything I wanted to talk to you  about, too, uh, on the show today, Opie said, you're in touch with the youth.  You know, hip-hop music is all about youth, young people, uh, the kids right now, like  the high school girls and everything, is there, uh, Opie says everybody's lezzing out.  Yeah.  That's the, that's the shit to do right now, is just to lezz out.  Nicki Minaj, look at Nicki Minaj. 
[00:05:00]  She's eating pussy on tour, like...  That's what she does on tour.  What?  That's, that's part of the show.  Like, she goes on stage and just starts...  It's part of the show.  Oh, my God.  And I gotta go to these shows.  We just found out Lady Gaga's hip-hop now, so...  So, is that what she's doing?  Is this why they're always shut?  Because you can't...  Yeah, we eating mad pussy in there.  My mouth is fucked up right now.  I need a doctor.  What do you think, what do you think, what do you think Dr. Dre came out with, I need  a doctor, man?  Because of his mouth, his jaw was on.  You know, he eat pussy, too.  I thought that you, the black guys, didn't do this. 
[00:05:30]  Well, 2011, that's the new thing now.  I like that.  You're going into the future.  We're taking over the white people's shit now, baby.  Oh, now we're in trouble.  Look at your mouth, man.  Well, you ate butt this morning, man.  I don't know anything about that.  I get up early.  Now, Anthony was on vacation for two weeks.  He was on a cruise.  Now, you might be doing what you're doing now, but you still don't fuck around with the  water too much, do you?  You know, black people can't swim.  Right.  So, you're not going to go on a cruise.  No skiing, no swimming.  Okay.  Okay.  So, not everything has changed. 
[00:06:00]  Definitely not.  But, Ant was on a, he was on a cruise for two weeks, and so we were talking about his  vacation stories, and Opie briefly mentioned that if he had gotten into any fights, because  Opie does.  Like, he goes on vacation.  On boats?  Yeah.  On yachts.  Like, he has his chains where it's at.  He's a very tense guy.  What?  And he ends up fighting with people in one circumstance.  I don't know if anything like this has ever happened to you.  You've probably been in your share of scuffles.  He got into an underwater fight.  Come on, man. 
[00:06:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  No, he was scuba diving.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  He was scuba diving, and there was a French guy underwater.  Get out of here.  And he got into a fist fight, you know, but slow motion, because he's underwater.  What?  The first guy I was talking to?  Yeah, I guess so.  I can't excuse him.  Do you think this is something, maybe you passed on to like 50 Cent and them to put in  a hip-hop video.  That'll be kind of L right there.  Like 50 Cent's making movies now to go with his albums.  What if it was something underwater?  Well, he has a new movie with Robert De Niro.  Maybe we could tell them to put that in the scene. 
[00:07:00]  There's a scene in there.  Like De Niro underwater, like, his old ass, like, trying to swing at fifth.  Well, we've got to play the story for everybody to bring in, and you can listen to.  Appreciate you stopping by, Hoot Kid.  Of course.  And we'll get you back on ONA soon.  Are you interviewing, I heard you're interviewing the Mob Wives this weekend?  Yeah, they're coming over.  They're kind of, like, horrified, because there's a lot of illegalities with them, but  it should be kind of cool.  Yeah, that's not...  And one of them, I always wanted to bang, but, you know...  Well, hopefully you'll get to that this weekend. 
[00:07:30]  No, because I don't want to be, you know, whacked.  Yeah.  If you're black, you get whacked.  It's on Shane 45 on Saturday.  All day on Saturday.  And on Twitter, DJ Who Kid.  And of course...  W-H-O-O.  Yeah, and I think Stodermal will be coming through also.  Yeah?  Yeah, you know, even though they lost yesterday.  Yeah, and I heard you and Mike Tyson have a friendship building.  Yeah, I'm going to kidnap him and bring him up here, so...  You have a weird celebrity relationship.  What?  You're always looking to get in on somewhere.  I was in L.A. with Billy Ray Cyrus. 
[00:08:00]  Like, it was...  Billy Ray Cyrus.  That's like my homeboy.  Yeah, he was up here with you.  Yeah, he gave me a bit of rash.  Like, he gave me a little bit of rash.  I don't know what he's talking about, but...  All right, well, thanks.  Give me a hug, too.  Is that no homo?  We hug here.  He's country, you know.  Don't even worry about him.  Okay, whoo.  I thought that was homo.  Thank God.  Well, thanks for stopping by, whoo kid.  This is Opie.  This is from several years ago, so if you haven't heard it, listen now.  Fresh are Opie getting in to his underwater fight club right here on After Opie and Anthony  Live. 
[00:08:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, I went to Tercey Canco's because I wanted to do some diving.  I dove all week.  I'm a beginner diver.  I only have about 10 dives under my belt, so I'm not going to act like I'm Jacques Cousteau  or anything.  I had to go diving with...  What, dead?  Yeah.  I'm no Jacques Cousteau.  I breathe.  I had a problem with this couple pretty much the whole time.  A French couple.  A French couple, and they didn't speak English.  Yeah, we...  So I go diving.  This was like midweek.  And, uh... 
[00:09:00]  This is kind of...  This isn't a good story.  All right.  So, uh, I start my descent to the bottom of the ocean.  To the bottom of the ocean, Opie.  Well, they only take you 60 feet, but that is the bottom where we're going.  Bottom of that part of the ocean, sure.  You know, and then you get to go over some ridges and stuff where it's a little deeper,  but whatever.  So you're with the guide.  Now, I've done about nine or ten dives, like I said, so it was quicker for me to get  to the bottom doing their first or second dive, okay?  You're feeling more comfortable than you did.  Feeling a little comfortable.  So I'm, uh, I'm at the bottom of the ocean waiting for the, my fellow divers, because 
[00:09:30]  you've got to dive in a group.  Bottom of the ocean.  Because I'm not really certified.  Yeah, 60...  Got your tanks on.  You're looking good.  Yes.  All right.  And I'm just looking around.  I'd like to fish and stuff.  Go, all right, cool.  I can't wait to start the dive.  Here comes, uh, the French guy.  What is this, a group-up point or something?  You all descend to the bottom of the ocean.  Well, I mean, if you want to get technical, you've got to descend to the 15-foot bar for a  while, hang out there, and then you drop from there.  But eventually, you're on the bottom of the ocean. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, as soon as they said drop from the bar, it took me, whatever, 10 seconds to get to  the bottom, more or less.  Do a little equalizing, and you're down there, ready to go.  So I'm at the bottom, 60 feet under, and here comes the French guy, that doesn't speak  English, that has the girlfriend with the hairy armpits that I just hated from the first  day I saw him at the club.  And now he's new, because you've got to go through the whole orientation thing.  Without a doubt, this guy was probably making his first dive.  Uh-huh.  Maybe second tops.  So he starts coming down, and I'm like, hello, I'm right here. 
[00:10:30]  Where was he looking?  He wasn't looking.  That's the problem.  Okay.  So I look up, I'm like, the son of a bitch is heading right for me.  Coming right for us!  That's right.  Do I have the clip of Opie somewhere?  I think I do.  Here's Opie on the bottom of the ocean.  It's coming right for us!  Oh, wow.  But see, this is how twisted my head is.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, exactly.  So I obviously could have probably moved and let him just land softly. 
[00:11:00]  On the bottom of the ocean, yes.  To where I was, but I wanted to see where this was going to go.  Uh-huh.  So I look up, and I'm like, he's getting closer, he's getting closer.  Is he going to move?  Is he going to move?  It doesn't move.  His fin pretty much takes out the left side of my face.  Hard.  Boom!  So his fin, he kicks you.  Yeah.  In the side of the head.  Yeah.  Now, does your regulator move or something?  No, no, no.  No, thank God.  You're under there.  No, because that would have been a whole different problem.  Then we would have taken it on land. 
[00:11:30]  That's all I'm going to say.  Okay?  Usually it's taken down a street level.  Okay.  We would have taken it on land.  On land.  You'll understand in a minute.  So he kicks you in the face.  Yeah, pretty much the left side of my forehead here.  Did your mask come loose?  Did anything like that?  Or right on the side of the head?  Right on the side of the head, mostly.  He came down like this, okay?  Ah.  All right, so.  So I'm like, look at that.  And I'm a little pissed.  Let me get this straight.  A French guy went down on Opie.  No, look.  House from Flanders, New Jersey. 
[00:12:00]  Listen to the rest of the story.  Yeah.  So he hits me.  But see, his legs were flailing as he's going down to the bottom.  So that, to me, was like, okay, he's a beginner.  I'll give him a little slack.  Right, he's freaking a little.  But boom, Finn hits me on the left side of the head.  He continues his descent.  Now he's basically, here comes the jokes, but he's basically on top of me, okay?  All right.  His tank now nails my hip.  And now he's coming down.  He's still coming down.  He's still coming down.  Now the heavy tank nails me in the side. 
[00:12:30]  And if you don't believe me, I mean, I could show you a bruise, but everyone's going to  call me a sound.  But trust me, it's there.  All right.  But if you need to see it, I'll, you know, I'll carefully show you the bruise.  Really bad.  So hold on to your seats, kids.  You're Palo.  What is it?  At this point, I give him the, I don't give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm just waiting  for like a look of, wow, you know, I'm sorry.  I'm out of my mind.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But he's French.  Except my apology.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter what language you speak, you can look at a guy and you can 
[00:13:00]  give him something with your facial reaction.  So you're still willing to play this off as he's a beginner.  But I'm heated.  Now you're pissed.  I'm heated.  On the bottom of the ocean.  He looks at me.  We're 60 feet under, okay?  Right.  He looks at me and he doesn't give me anything.  Nothing.  You know when someone cuts you off and does a stupid move on the road, but you can almost  see through it if they kind of give you that look like, I know I screwed up.  I'm really sorry.  Please forgive me.  You're still a little pissed, but at least they acknowledged it.  Yes.  The guy didn't acknowledge it, and that really pissed me off. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  So I punched him in the head.  You punch a French guy in the head.  Now, you're on the bottom of the ocean.  60 feet under.  I start a fight with a French guy.  What's wrong with you?  Now, where did you hit him?  Right on the side of the head.  All right.  In the side of the head.  You made sure you didn't hit his regulator or his mask.  I was just going for the headshot.  Or you didn't even care.  You just happened to land on the side.  No, I didn't care. 
[00:14:00]  No, because the rest of the body is pretty much protected with the vest and the tanks  and you got a wetsuit on, you know?  So I pop him on the side of the head.  Now, you're sitting there like, oh, my God.  You know, wow, you're so brave and stuff.  Yeah.  Obviously, it was a slow motion fight because we're 60 feet under the water.  You can't really get a good punch flying underwater.  Even James Bond had difficulty in the movies.  I couldn't get my weight behind the punch.  Right.  It was just kind of...  But it made me feel good.  Now, were you standing up at this point? 
[00:14:30]  Sort of, yeah.  Your feet are kind of touching the sand at the bottom of the ocean.  I was probably just above the sand.  All right.  Because they wanted to stay off the bottom, man.  Right.  Coral and stuff.  Right.  So, yeah, it was like a $6 million man fight in slow motion.  I punched him in the side of the head, the French guy.  He proceeds to push me.  Now you're getting into...  You're into...  You're throwing down.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  You're throwing down...  60 feet underwater.  60 feet underwater with a Frenchie.  Which, quite frankly, is, you know, kind of scary.  Like I said, I'm only 10 dives into my little diving career, so it's still a little...  And he's fighting.  I'm fighting.  You can't fight underwater like that.  So he pushes me, but, you know, obviously the effort just isn't really there, because  you're not on solid ground, and you're 60 feet under the water.  Right.  So that's when I attempted to tackle him.  Because your instincts take over.  Now, if you're on land...  Aquaman. 
[00:15:30]  If you're on land, every fight starts with a couple punches, maybe a couple pushes,  and then you get down into, hopefully, wrestling and throwing someone down on the ground,  right?  So...  How will Aquaman handle this?  So my instincts take over.  I'm like, all right, well...  No matter where you are.  I attempt to tackle him 60 feet under the water.  So now what?  Bring me through it.  How did you go to tackle?  I just kind of went forward.  You went forward, of course.  And, you know, I tried to grab him and knock him down, realizing it just wasn't going to  work. 
[00:16:00]  At this point, the guide had to break this up.  He's breaking up a fight 60 feet underwater.  Yes.  Aquaman then whistled for a seahorse and rode off.  Now, I don't think the guide saw everything that was going on.  Oh, the rest of the people in our group definitely did.  They were watching?  Oh, yeah.  Placing some pets?  Oh, yeah.  I'd have been like, this is the coolest thing I'll ever see underwater.  I don't care if a goddamn mermaid swims by right now. 
[00:16:30]  This is a brawl.  Wait, this guy's got a similar story.  A fight.  I thought this was quite unique.  Jesus.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Oh, kicking ass underwater.  Had something similarly happen to me in Cancun.  Yeah.  The guy, the flapper, threw me like an elbow shiv right to the head.  Yeah.  So instead of like retaliating that way with fists, I just ripped the dude's oxygen right  off the dude almost drowned.  Now, that, I think, could be attempted murder.  Break him, dude. 
[00:17:00]  I ain't taking a shot to the nose.  I know I'm bleeding underwater.  I'm like foggy.  For two days, I was like, duh.  You know, and I think this type of thing happens more often than you think because the dive  guy, the guy that goes with you, he wants his group close together because you've got  to, you know, watch it.  Got to watch everybody.  And, you know, some of these guys, when they're doing their first or second, I'm going to say  it again, I'm only 10 dives in, but I feel a little more comfortable under the water.  I mean, their arms and stuff are flailing.  They're freaking out because it's the first time they're underwater. 
[00:17:30]  Will from Staten Island checking in.  You're breaking the rules.  He said the first rule of underwater fight club is you don't talk about underwater fight club.  Underwater fight club.  It's Tyler Durden.  It was great, though.  I'm not going to break you in my face.  Oh, dear.  I can't get a good strength.  What is your problem?  Underwater fight club. 
[00:18:00]  So then, yeah, then the guy, you know, he broke us up and we went on our dive.  I'm convinced he didn't see the whole thing because I think he would have brought us all  back to the top.  And then the rest of the dive, any time he got close to me, I just kind of pushed him  off.  I would stay away from you at that point thinking you were a complete lunatic.  All right.  Who fights underwater?  Now, every contact the guy made with you, Opie, was accidental.  Careless, stupid, but it wasn't intentional.  Every contact you made with him was intentionally to hurt this gentleman. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, I snapped.  No, no, no, no.  It was underwater.  No, because there was a bunch of other things I could have done.  Turn off his air hose.  That would have freaked him out a little bit.  Jesus Christ.  Did you take into consideration where you were when you decided then you were going  to tackle this guy?  Man, I can't believe he is tackling me.  What is this lunatic?  Let me make it perfectly clear.  It looked completely ridiculous.  Nothing got done.  There was no, there was no, you know, no one really getting hurt.  It's just the fact that I snapped 60 feet under the water and punched a guy. 
[00:19:00]  After ONA Live.  That's what it is.  I'm Sam Robertson.  Who can't relate to getting into a fight like that underwater?  I mean, sometimes when you're on vacation, tensions run a little high and things happen.  But Roland just came by.  What do you got there?  I saw you walking down the halls.  Anybody who's walking there as the Ron and Fez intern set up for Ron and Fez coming up next.  Anybody who would stop, you were showing them, what is that, another Bruce thing? 
[00:19:30]  I say thank you to Liam.  He gave me the Bruce record from Record Day.  Oh, what is it?  It's a...  It's actually vinyl...  Vinyl, two songs of the boss.  What is it, a 45?  Uh, no, no.  You have no idea.  Do you have a turntable?  I do.  Oh, you do.  Are you going to...  But you're not going to open that.  Probably not.  That's a collector's item.  Yes.  You're not wearing a Bruce...  I'm not.  You're in the Steelers Nation today.  Yeah, because people think I'm too creepy wearing it every day. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, that's not why people think you're creepy.  Really?  Yeah.  No.  But don't worry about it.  Um...  Wait, what'd you hear?  Don't even worry about that.  I just thought Gary Busey was on Wendy Williams.  Yeah.  He got eliminated off Celebrity Apprentice last night.  Yes.  I know, because I watch every week.  How come no Gary Busey in here?  It was pre-taped.  Pre-taped with Wendy?  Mm-hmm.  How did she know he was going to get voted off?  That's how good she is.  Wow!  She had, like, super sense.  So, is Gary Busey not here anymore?  Mm-hmm.  He's only here for one day. 
[00:20:30]  Are we going to get any Celebrity Apprentice people?  Yes.  Oh, you know something.  No.  Oh, god damn you, Roland.  God damn you.  I'll give you a scoop.  Yeah?  Not really.  Roland, do we have anybody coming in this week?  Uh, this week...  Uh, yeah, I'm just getting final confirmations.  Oh, so you don't want to announce anything before...  True that.  Okay, I gotcha.  Well, congratulations on the Springsteen record.  Woo!  From the bottom of my heart. 
[00:21:00]  Um, you know, we were doing the vacation stories, and, uh, Opie did the Fight Club thing,  Ant was out, and he was on a cruise for two weeks.  And I, for whatever reason, I'm sure, hopefully a lot of you do, whenever now I think of, uh,  cruises, all I think of is Patrice and the Rock Coat.  Roland, were you around when Patrice first talked about the Rock Coat?  Yes.  You remember this?  I do.  It was when, uh, we kept hearing stories about people missing coming back from cruises and 
[00:21:30]  just realized it was the perfect crime and just assumed that...  I wonder if Ant's girlfriend thought to herself, is Ant bringing me on this cruise so he can  push me off?  Because for a while, Opie and Anthony were obsessed with the fact, and this is going back to, uh, 2005, for a while, Opie and Anthony were obsessed with people getting pushed off cruise ships.  I would assume that there'd be a lot of suspicion if, uh, if Ant had come back alone.  He did, they were making movie posters, so...  Yeah, so you'd, I mean, that, that, that, that rom-com could take an ugly turn. 
[00:22:00]  And he would win a lot of money, too, so...  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  You don't, you're just pointing out details from the trip now.  Pretty much.  It doesn't add anything.  No.  No.  Poor Roland.  You sound so sweet, though, when you say no.  Well, um, this was a day in, as I said, in 2005, when Patrice O'Neill was in studio, uh, we were talking about another story of a person disappearing off a cruise ship, and what does Patrice bring to the table? 
[00:22:30]  But the concept of, you know, you get off the ships, and they're all selling stuff.  So what could be more convenient than, for somebody who wants to murder a loved one, than a coat made of rock?  A rock coat.  E-Rock, did you have anything to do with this, or is this just something you share your name with?  No, this is just something I share the name with.  You were there that day, right?  Yes, I was.  You're a cruise guy.  Yes, I am.  Have you ever brought your wife on a cruise?  No, she, uh, for years I couldn't get her to go on one, because she was terrified of going on a boat. 
[00:23:00]  Now, is that because she gets seasick, or you're gonna give her the old heave-ho?  Well, now I'm sure it's that reason, but before it was just, she was worried about, uh, being bored and being sick.  Because let's be honest, if it's between you and her, she ain't getting you over that rail, is she?  No.  No, that's...  Low center of gravity.  That's where that weight is going to, you're gonna be able to take advantage of it, but not everybody is.  I'm very buoyant.  Yes, yes you are.  You'll fall into the water and just float up like a buoy.  Ah, just stay here then, guys, just whenever. 
[00:23:30]  You'd survive a long, long time.  Um, thanks.  Yeah, plus you got that whale blubber going for me.  I'll stay warm.  It's mean.  In the cold waters of the Atlantic.  I'm glad you ever stay.  You sound like the CD guys outside, uh, for, uh, Times Square.  Who, I do?  Oh, oh yeah, because before we go to this bit, real quick.  E-Rock, we were walking back from lunch with Roland the other day.  Oh, right, yeah.  And the guys selling the rap CDs, they were just trying to get people to buy CDs.  Yeah.  And, you know, swindling them.  It's what they do here on Times Square.  They say it's free, and then as soon as you take it, they sign it, and they say, you owe 
[00:24:00]  me ten bucks.  Right, and they kind of walk with you and intimidate you into giving money to them, like a bully  does in high school.  And I, and they always, I'm walking by then, they always say something about my hair, and  I just nod at them and ignore them.  And then the three of us are walking by, and as we're walking by, they make a hair comment  and follow it up with, yo, fatso!  I was so angry that they did that to E-Rock.  I was like, no, no, no, no, that's not who it was.  Roland, I do think they're...  I was already rounded the corner, and you were the one...  Speaking of round.  Yeah, good one.  That, that, that, that, that is true. 
[00:24:30]  They did point at me.  And Roland, you turned around.  I turned around, and then...  You almost said a nasty word, then you counted how many people were there.  I just said...  And then you went along your business.  I said, you know what, they're correct.  And they are.  I'm going to try this way.  Well, from one, from one brother to another, it's Patrice O'Neill in studio as he introduces  the rock coat on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We got the audio of the story here.  You know, once you board a cruise ship, you really are in the hands of the cruise ship 
[00:25:00]  company.  Whoops.  But if something goes wrong, what happens?  Who's responsible?  Well, that is the subject of that special hearing on, on Capitol Hill this afternoon.  It comes just days after another cruise ship passenger has disappeared.  When Royal Caribbean's Jewel of the Seas returned to Florida on Sunday, it had one less passenger  than when it departed.  A Canadian, 59-year-old Jill Begora, was last seen by her husband on Saturday morning as the  ship approached the port of Nassau in the Bahamas.  A search by a U.S. Coast Guard ship and the Bahamian Navy found no trace of her. 
[00:25:30]  Her family just wants to know what happened.  It's just too much to comprehend, you know?  I hope everything's all right, but, you know, all those things are sometimes.  You hope everything's all right.  Are you?  Insane.  You're hoping everything, like she's going to turn up.  Oh, I was, uh, I was just taking a swim.  Yeah.  I like swimming. 
[00:26:00]  Then you just ask a question, like, um, what's the percentage of when people are missing  on these boats?  What's the percentage that you find them alive?  That actually come back and.  0.0001.  They might have found them.  Some got lost.  Lost in the place where they keep, like, the vegetables way in the hold.  Somewhere in the bilge.  It's Tom.  It's Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  I was looking for the, uh, I was looking for the pool deck.  And I ended up down here where the fucking.  Some ass that forgot to take his medicine. 
[00:26:30]  Ends up in a meat locker somewhere.  Somewhere locked in a meat locker.  They never find you.  That chick, man.  That was probably a bad marriage.  And the guy figured out a way to get out of it.  Oh, you think?  Because that's probably it.  Either you're killing yourself or someone is killing you.  There's got to be people that plan it out and go, look, we'll be on a cruise ship.  Yeah.  A little, a slight push and I'm.  A little drink.  Maybe slip her a little Mickey.  And then give her the heave ho.  They'll never find her to do toxicology.  What goes through your mind to give your loved one? 
[00:27:00]  Because there was a time you loved this person.  What goes through your head as you're giving her the heave ho?  Not even the heave ho.  What goes through your mind when you're. . .  Because you're already committed at the heave ho.  Right.  What goes through your mind when you're like. . .  On a cruise.  Like, and you hold the tickets up knowing I'm going to kill this fucking bitch.  The ticket wave.  The ticket wave.  You got both of them in your hand.  You're waving them like a fan.  Baby, we're going on a cruise.  And you know it's going to end with a heave ho.  The heave ho is somewhere in that itinerary. 
[00:27:30]  Do you talk her into. . .  We got Nassau.  Right.  All right.  And then we're going to St. Martin.  Right.  And then heave ho.  Right.  And. . .  Between Miami and Nassau, I'm doing the heave ho.  Heave ho.  And do you make sure she wears a special outfit so you can hold on to the outfit better  to give yourself some leverage?  I think. . .  I think nude.  I think you got to plan where your room is.  You want your room at the back of the ship.  Right?  Buy the bitch a rock coat from Jamaica. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, right.  This the new rock coat, man.  It's made of stone.  It's made of stone.  Zip the rock coat and throw her overboard.  He'll throw this rock coat on, man.  A beautiful rock coat.  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  This is a big stone, man, yo.  Get the. . .  Did you get her the stone flip-flops, too, man? 
[00:28:30]  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Here's the rock coat.  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave hoeing.  All right.  People dancing on the upper deck.  You bump the bitch off right in the conga line.  Come on, everybody.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Woo.  Come on one more time around the promenade.  Oh, everybody.  Sink like a rock, rock, rock. 
[00:29:00]  We're your rock, rock coat.  Come on, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to try this.  So this is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave ho.  Yeah.  Do you have a splash, Anthony?  Oh, boy.  The heave ho, and everyone's having a good time upstairs.  Hold on.  So then you do the heave ho.  First, you got to get rid of her. 
[00:29:30]  Knock her on the head.  All right.  You knock her on the head.  But she's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh, that was the splash?  Yeah.  You got it.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  That's what she hears.  Oh, I found a friend. 
[00:30:00]  It goes through your mind.  Oh, no.  And then reality sinks in, and it's over.  That's the boat.  Sail the boat.  The boat's sailing away.  That's the last thing you hear from civilization is, oh, I can feel it hot, hot, hot, hot.  Oh, that hole from my yellow piss in that blue water.  Oh, done.  I just would die.  All right, here we go.  Here's more audio of passengers disappearing. 
[00:30:30]  It is estimated that about a dozen people have disappeared on cruises in the last two years.  A dozen?  Legally, it is a murky area because the ships fly foreign flags.  And so this afternoon, Congress will convene a special hearing into crimes and disappearances aboard cruise ships.  The bottom line is we are suspicious, candidly, that there's some huge problems in the cruise line industry.  And we think that people are not aware of some of the challenges and some of the potential problems they may encounter. 
[00:31:00]  It's not a huge problem for the cruise industry.  There are people out there that have figured out how to off their loved one, a problem person.  Yeah, like I said, you've got to be in the back of the boat, one of the lower balconies.  So that way, no one, you know, is going to see the body floating by once they're off in the back of the boat.  Nobody's going to anywhere.  You said, you've been on a cruise open?  Oh, yeah.  It's, there's nothing, there's no place anywhere in the boat that you can't die and somebody will see you. 
[00:31:30]  You don't need a special plan for this.  You just toss them off anywhere by the boat, anywhere, falling.  There's nobody to hear you.  It's a giant mall.  That's what the fuck, it's not even something you enjoy to see.  It's not even the ocean.  And you would do it late at night while everyone else is pretty much back in their rooms.  Yes, snoozing, three in the morning, whereas when this guy disappeared, by the way.  Quick, easy murder of your wife on the boat, right? 
[00:32:00]  This is so romantic.  Look at the stars.  We don't get to see those kind of stars in New York, do we, sweetie?  Oh, my God, all the building light.  Look at, wow, I think that one's Jupiter.  Come here, bitch.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter!  Yeah.  What's up, Peter?  So the real question I have is, if you're taking a cruise out to Nassau, do you throw her off the boat before or after you get there?  Yeah, I got, hmm.  By the beach, I would say after, because it's hard to throw her off and look convincingly sad if you're then on the beach hanging with some chicks and an umbrella drink. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  I just lost my wife.  I can't find her, but I paid for the fucking cruise.  Right.  I might as well have a dirty banana.  Might as well enjoy it.  You know, I'm going to have a few rum drinks and some pina coladas for everybody.  Get my hair braided.  It's like a rum twizzle right after throwing the bitch overboard.  All right, I'm buying.  The fucking rock coat is killing me, Patrice. 
[00:33:00]  Get your rock coat.  Get your rock coat, man.  And these goofy motherfuckers are buying.  Oh, a rock coat.  Wow.  A rock coat is great.  You got a guy on the Coast Guard.  Bill, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  My last duty station was in Sandy Hook, New Jersey.  Our area of responsibility was Lower New York Harbor.  And we were out looking for a guy that fell off a Russian trader.  Tell you, man, there's no fucking way you're going to find somebody out there.  If they don't have a strobe light or anything with them, do live man overboard drills. 
[00:33:30]  We used to actually jump off the boat at nighttime with our strobe lights.  Wow.  You want to talk about fucking scary?  And this is a training drill where they know you're jumping.  They're looking for you.  You have a strobe.  And they still can't find you because the waves are bobbing up and down.  Yeah, all of a sudden that strobe disappears and then comes back because he's bobbing in the waves.  What's the official can't find him time?  What's the official we did what we could time?  Yeah.  He just fucking looked for him. 
[00:34:00]  He just looked for him until he told you to stop.  Are you kidding me?  These Coast Guard guys, they just make one big circle and look at their watches.  Nah, we know this guy's gone.  And what's your call?  Like, yo!  Yo!  All right, wrap it up.  You there!  Hello!  I bet they're a little more tactful.  I bet it's like...  Bravo, we're running a little low on fuel.  We're going to be bringing it back. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  It's burning like crazy for me because the gates are in the habitat, but I'm sure we have less.  We're going back.  This motherfucker is so drowned.  So drowned.  Oh, the mic is still keyed.  Sorry.  You can't...  It's just, you know, who are you fooling?  It is what it is.  You can't be mad about it.  It's the ocean.  It's unbelievable, man.  It's just so dark. 
[00:35:00]  And how deep is the deepest part of the Atlantic?  What, a thousand feet or something like that?  A thousand?  A mile deep?  I'm talking.  After 10 feet, who cares?  After ONA, it's live.  And that's what it is.  Sam Roberts here.  All the staff is still here.  E-Rock, Travis, Mars was just walking around doing God knows what.  I don't even know what Mars does on a day-to-day basis, but he is the engineer.  And since you're hearing this, he's got to be doing something.  Right, E-Rock?  Right?  Yeah, I guess.  I'm still laughing about that bit.  I think that's Jupiter. 
[00:35:30]  Come here, bitch.  I was just going to say that to me, there's nothing more terrible.  Terrifying than the idea of just watching the movie Open Water or 127 Hours or, I don't  know, I just thought over the weekend, that dumb movie Frozen where they're stuck on a  ski lift.  Just being stuck in a perilous situation where it seems like you're not going to make it  out alive because you're counting on people to find you and you know they won't is the  most terrifying thing in the entire world to me.  I think I was scarred watching Punky Brewster as a kid because I always thought my mom was 
[00:36:00]  going to leave me at the mall and I would have to find some nice pedophile to live with.  Oh, that episode.  I thought you meant the one where they were playing...  That was the premise of the whole series.  The one where they were playing hide-and-seek and Sherry got hit in an old refrigerator and  suffocated.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  This is what I'm talking about.  These things terrify me, but for whatever reason, that Rock Coat bit where they're just...  And the line where they're in the conga line and just knocking a bitch off the boat and  hearing the music on the boat fade away as the boat leaves. 
[00:36:30]  These things...  I remember laughing out loud the first time I heard it and I'm laughing out loud to this  day.  It's a horrible thing.  We haven't played that in so...  ...every day.  I mean, maybe that's going to become a regular thing.  Unfortunately, we're running out of time.  I wanted to go into snuba-ing a little bit.  We mentioned that with Bob Kelly, but maybe we'll get to that tomorrow.  But what we do have to mention, and I wish we had brought it up at the top of the show.  Unfortunately, we could because DJ Who Kid was here, so how could we? 
[00:37:00]  But the most annoying 30 seconds.  The most annoying 30 seconds that you can come up with.  It has to relate somehow to the show and really should have some kind of entertainment value  because it is a contest.  This is the last week to submit most annoying 30 seconds sounds.  You just have to email an mp3.  All the details are at SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  You have to email it to the legitimate address, the contest address, not to any of our personal 
[00:37:30]  emails that you may have.  You have to send it.  I think it's OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  But as I said, all the details are on the website.  And somebody is going to win, not only if you win this, which to me should be enough,  but will play the shit out of your most annoying 30 seconds, and you're going to win $2,000 from  Steven Singer Jewelers.  So I don't know how you can do better.  Do you have, Jim, the one that won last time? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, I was just going to say you want to hear that one.  Yeah, this is the most annoying 30 seconds.  We did this, how many years ago?  Three, four years?  Five?  Yeah, something like that.  It was four or five years ago that we did this the first time.  This is the 30 seconds that won the first time.  It's annoying and it's entertaining, and that's why it works. 
[00:38:30]  Now, a lot of you guys are just trying to kind of copy that sound.  I mean, I know you don't want to reinvent the wheel, it's only 30 seconds of sound, but  try to do something a little original, something that will make us go, you know what, that's  infuriating, but it's also something that we have to put on the air, because that's what's 
[00:39:00]  going to win.  It's $2,000 we're talking about.  We're not just giving it away willy-nilly to whoever.  And, I mean, I don't know.  There's a lot that we've gone through.  We're still going through it.  Um, and hopefully you'll win the $2,000 and get some air time.  We'll play it.  We'll play it, not just here.  It's not an after O&A contest, believe it or not.  It's an Opie and Anthony contest.  It'll get played on the main show, I promise.  Okay?  You can take my word for it.  Oh, look who made it at the buzzer. 
[00:39:30]  At the buzzer!  Just as we were getting ready to wrap up and allow you to start your show, the whole family's  back together.  Ron Bennington is here.  We're all here.  Um, why didn't you call me Saturday night?  I'd have been here in a heartbeat.  Well, I mean, I was just kind of...  First of all, I don't have your phone number.  You wouldn't have given it to me.  Go to my buddy E-Rock.  He's got everything.  There's a complete connection.  I've heard.  He's the only one that I feel close to after he did something wonderful for me. 
[00:40:00]  The picture?  Yeah.  Not just that, but the thoughtfulness behind it.  That's what it was.  It's the way that you're not, Sam.  It's like...  I'm thoughtful.  Not towards me.  I kind of stretched to make sure we got you on a little bit towards the end.  Dave works once a week and he doesn't show up for his gatekeeper.  He had to go to this wedding.  I would be...  I don't know.  I swear to God.  I don't know how the bosses put up with you guys.  Well, I was here.  It was a good show.  Actually, it was a better show.  I'll just leave it at that.  Oh, don't tell me. 
[00:40:30]  You're going to make people insecure.  No, I don't want anybody to be insecure.  It was a good show.  It's always a good show.  Yeah, but there was something this week, and I was talking to Steve Blatter.  There was something this week that worked that wasn't there the week before.  Well, it must have been the Dave phone calls then when Dave and me were talking back and forth.  I tuned out for that.  I went over to see what they were doing.  Fantasy Sports Talk.  Sports Grumblings.  Well, listen, there's great...  That can't be a name.  Sports Grumblings.  That's too stupid.  There's great programming throughout the entire platform. 
[00:41:00]  Well, are you...  Do you feel like the virus is whole again now that Anthony's back?  It does.  It's Ant is back.  I think.  I hope he's going to settle down now and not feel like he's got to be on every show.  You notice that now that Ant's back, we're back to ending at 10 and out the door.  No more hanging around.  No more running in and doing time with the other shows.  No.  He's not even doing after ONA anymore.  He was doing it for a couple weeks, but not anymore.  All right.  So...  But that's good.  Everybody needs to...  Because this is who we are.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  This is who we are.  Everyone's back.  I mean, Obi even did Covino and Rich on Friday.  He's done every show possible.  You know what I remind you of is, like, if...  Like, with...  You watch Mob Wives, right?  Sure.  Of course.  I mean, me?  As soon as the husband goes into jail, they have sex with everybody.  So that's the thing.  I see.  Anthony's out of that prison right now called Vacation.  I got you.  By the way, what are you guys taking off for Easter?  What day?  We haven't decided...  A conversation before the show saying, hey, are we going to take that Monday off? 
[00:42:00]  And Ope goes, yeah, we'll figure it out.  And Travis is just going, yeah, because it's next...  It's next Monday.  I don't know whether it's a Friday or a Monday that you're supposed to take off.  Well, it's not...  For us, neither.  It's not a company holiday.  Oh, I thought that it was.  No, there are no company holidays surrounding Easter, so...  I thought there was.  Well, all right, so...  Prepare for a couple five-day weeks.  The fact that our Lord died and then rose from that.  Yeah.  Never done before or after.  One time only.  That's not worth a holiday.  No, you got Sunday. 
[00:42:30]  But Martin Luther King Day.  Hey, everybody go to the beach.  He had a dream.  It's February.  Go to the beach.  Are you doing anything to celebrate Passover?  I'm going to Passover dinner.  I'm going to try to do the Passover thing where you don't...  Like, you kind of South Beach it.  Yeah.  I don't even understand it.  But I like to get into any kind of the cruelty things.  All right.  Well, we should let you do your show.  I'm already running into your time.  You know, Fez will go crazy on me.  I don't like that.  I hope Fez is going to have a great week this week.  He had a decent week last week.  Son, that was good.  Well, as long as nobody from the Letterman show makes him upset, yeah, I think he'll be fine. 
[00:43:00]  By the way, Justin Stengel, I talked to him on Twitter.  He felt bad.  He legitimately did not want that to happen.  That wasn't his intention.  And yet he did it.  I guess we can't take back our actions, can we?  No.  It happened.  Well, stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is next.  We'll see you tomorrow with more after Opie and Anthony live.  After Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  On the virus. </pre>
