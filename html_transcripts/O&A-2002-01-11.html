<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast begins with a celebratory tone, fueled by their soaring ratings in Boston, a stark contrast to their dismal performance at WBCN, which they gleefully report is now receiving less than 2% of the listening audience in their time slot.  They mock WBCN's use of fake calls and content, speculating on the imminent firing of their former colleague Rocco and his boss, Dave, based on inside information.  Rocco himself calls in, attempting to maintain a positive attitude despite his professional struggles. Other callers congratulate the hosts, express outrage at WBCN’s programming, and discuss various topics including a controversial Malcolm X postage stamp.  Louie Anderson even calls, jokingly claiming he'll replace Rocco.  A caller claiming to be Ozzy Osbourne also adds to the chaotic mix.  The hosts discuss upcoming events including a listener's wedding and bachelor party and the impending appearance of Colin Hanks and Jack Black.  A substantial portion is devoted to a discussion on the dynamics of male-female friendships, with the hosts arguing that men always desire a sexual relationship with their female friends.  Their plan to have a 19-year-old virgin lose her virginity on air is discussed, highlighting the boyfriend's reluctance. The segment concludes with a comedic bit by Pablo Francisco.  Throughout, the hosts employ profanity and vulgar language, making frequent sexually explicit comments.

The show continues with crude jokes about Jackie Chan, "yo mama" jokes, and knock-knock jokes.  Listener emails and phone calls follow, including one from Greg from Hoboken on male/female relationships.  A phone call with Jennifer explores the motivations behind friendships between attractive men and women, interrupted by a dropped call.  Scott Perel, a new friend of the show, calls in while drinking and listening to Metallica.  The conversation involves the 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin wanting to lose her virginity on the show, the hosts’ new studio furniture (including a damaged pinball machine), Perel’s hotel stay, gambling habits, and boisterous personality.  He makes offensive and colorful sports predictions.

The discussion shifts to their poor New York ratings, introducing in-studio guests Rich Voss and Patrice. Voss attempts new jokes, including one about Jared from Subway, prompting teasing from the hosts about his age, car, and jokes. The banter becomes increasingly personal and includes offensive racial and other remarks.  A call from Elizabeth (who clarifies she is not Lisa) discusses her long menstrual period and her boyfriend's reluctance to have sex with her while menstruating, leading to crude commentary from the hosts and guests.

Jack Black and Colin Hanks arrive to promote *Orange County*.  The conversation covers Black’s mother’s work on the Hubble Space Telescope, Black's fantasies, pornography, foosball techniques, and the use of Pledge furniture polish.  Jokes and banter ensue, primarily related to their movie and personal anecdotes, concluding with a mention of Black's upcoming concert.

Jack Black and Colin Hanks remain in the studio.  The conversation starts with Black discussing his film roles, including a questionable scene in *Airborne*, *Mars Attacks*, and *Get Over It*.  Their appearance on *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* is discussed, speculating on a perceived tension with Regis Philbin.  A call from "tall midget" Nicole Star promotes her adult website.  The hosts coax her into the studio, leading to sexually charged conversation and repeated requests for her to disrobe.  Nicole partially removes her clothing on-air, encouraged by the hosts and guests.  The segment continues with discussion of Nicole's website and the hosts’ Valentine's Day plan to find virgins to lose their virginity.  Sexually explicit dialogue and jokes abound.

The show heavily features a phone call with Jason and his girlfriend Nicole (in the studio).  The hosts attempt to facilitate Nicole losing her virginity to Jason, who is reluctant, wanting a more private and romantic experience. This leads to jokes about Nicole's close male friend, Dougie (also on the phone and physically present). Jack Black and Colin Hanks participate, promoting their work and commenting on the situation.  Several "FU line" calls express anger and frustration.  A drunken, rambling call from "Lady Di" is berated by the hosts.  The "slutty virgin" contest is discussed, and the segment concludes with a renewed plan to facilitate Nicole and Jason's sexual encounter the following Monday.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Friday! Friday! Friday!  Friday!  Cancel your appointment!  Eee! Eee! Eee!  Take your ball and take your ball!  Oh, I need a drink!  Are you ready?  Oh, ah!  Hey everybody! We're all gonna get late!  Why would you be sad? 
[00:00:30]  Your balls are showing!  Oh, Billy!  I'm just a flaming bag!  She was a hooah!  Sweet, merciful crap!  Can I touch it?  Marijuana is the bomb!  Oh, ah!  Stupid hooker! 
[00:01:00]  Way back!  Stay beautiful!  Order the screen!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Yeah, thanks, Dick!  Use it or lose it!  I need to go pooping!  Woo-hoo!  I told you!  Hey!  Hey!  Whoa, what a bitch!  Hey! 
[00:01:30]  Okay, terrific!  You maniacs!  You blew it up!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show!  Hi!  Hello!  Hello!  A couple phone numbers, Anthony, in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Where?  Come on, come on, we know!  Boston, Massachusetts!  Boston!  Boston!  You sons of bitches, we love you.  866-221-1027.  866-221-1027.  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show! 
[00:02:00]  Hi!  Hello!  A couple phone numbers, Anthony, in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Where?  Come on, come on, we know!  Boston, Massachusetts!  Boston!  Boston!  You sons of bitches, we love you.  866-277-4WOW.  Looks like the O.B. and Anthony Show made a little comeback.  Oh, yeah!  Made a little comeback in the ratings thing, Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  We made a comeback.  Wasn't looking good for the boys for a little while.  I remember, um, yeah, about a month ago or so.  We weren't feeling very good about, uh, ourselves up there in Boston.  But, man, oh, man!  Let's just put it this way.  Oedipus and Tony at WBCN in Boston look like geniuses today.  Oh, yeah.  They look like absolute geniuses today.  Mm-hmm.  And they should.  Yes.  They're the Boston...  Bring us back to Boston, Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  And it's paying dividends!  Oh, yeah.  Ratings came out for Boston.  And, uh, we are more good-er.  More good-er.  More good-er in Boston.  Another more good-er for the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I love the cities that are more good-er.  New York?  Less good-er.  But that's okay.  Uh, Philadelphia?  More good-er.  More good-er.  And now Boston?  More good-er.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the cities that are more good-er are more good-er.  More good-er.  Somehow, I think, right before we sign off, I'll be seeing that in instant feedback. 
[00:03:30]  Just to put this in perspective for everybody.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony and I were hired to be number one men, 18 of 49.  That is it.  Yeah.  That's nice.  That is it.  I mean, if we do, well, with other demos...  Which we have.  Which we do.  That's great.  But that is our whole goal, right?  Yes.  New York, we are number one men, 18 of 49.  Yeah.  Look it up.  Even our critics.  Philadelphia, number one men, 18 of 49. 
[00:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Boston, number one men...  Yes.  ...18 to 49.  Thank you.  We are kicking the ass of our old radio station at this point.  Hey!  Shut up!  It's not even close.  It's really ridiculous.  It looks like you guys have finally woken up and realized how fake the radio was over there.  Some people, I was starting to believe, really, really enjoyed the fake radio. 
[00:04:30]  That made up fake phone calls, the fake weddings, the fake bachelor parties, all that fake stuff.  I was thinking, oh my god, I can't believe, I guess we were away a little too long.  And Boston kind of forgot about what it's like to just hang out and have some fun.  And they like the fake stuff now.  You know how bad it is for our old radio station in this time slot, Anthony?  Huh? 
[00:05:00]  I don't want to bore people with ratings.  Mm-hmm.  We've been analyzing it for a while now.  For the month of December, we'll just take that.  Yeah.  Less than 2% of all the radios that are on right now in the Boston area between 3 and 7 are listening to our old radio station.  Less than 2%.  Less than 2%.  Do you want to get just a tad, just a pinch deeper into that? 
[00:05:30]  It's not even 2% of all the radios that are there.  It's less than 2% of the ones that are on.  That are on.  That are on.  Right now in the Boston area.  Less than 2% of all radios on right now between 3 and 7 are tuned into our old radio station WAF.  You are truly better off with a bullhorn screaming out the window, out there and whatever that station is.  And that's all the radios.  Right.  I mean, if you break it down even further and do the comparison with men, 18 of 49, men 18 of 34, it gets even uglier. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's frightening.  So there you have it.  I was thinking they were into the fake radio of Boston.  You were fooling me for a while there.  Why don't you go congratulate Rocco at the Centrum today?  Yeah.  Schlock, Hull, and Maddie are broadcasting live.  We'll give them a little plug, right?  Sure. 
[00:06:30]  They're broadcasting live from the Worcester Centrum in Massachusetts.  Yeah.  So if you're heading down there, I think there's some kind of, what, motocross thing going on?  If you're heading down there to check it out and you see Rocco, congratulate him, please, on his fine showing.  Someone's got to promote his appearance because no one's hearing him when he promotes his own appearance.  More people will hear him if he just got in the middle of the Centrum and screamed.  Jesus.  He's all over the board. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, he lost his.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were taking a sip then.  It is funny.  It is very funny.  Oh, he just lost all the water he was drinking.  Nice spit take.  Sorry.  See how funny that is?  It's true, though.  If he got in the middle of the Worcester Centrum and just...  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:07:30]  It's Rocco!  My ratings are up today because I'm talking to you people live.  Oh, God.  We were cruising around the website that they have over there at that station.  We like seeing where our pal's going to be.  We just like seeing where he's going to be.  And they had some bits on their website.  So I click on them to hear some phone calls and whatnot that were made. 
[00:08:00]  And it is so fake.  Like, I don't know who's actually believing that these are real calls.  Well, they're proud of them.  That's why they're on the website.  Yeah.  They want everyone to listen to us.  Like, you'd only put your best stuff up there.  Hell, man.  We would play it on our show, but we don't want anyone thinking that we actually did the  call and that we're proud of it, so...  No, that was the comic stylings of Schlocko and Maddie. 
[00:08:30]  It's so bad.  Like, they call some therapist three times, and you could tell it's not a therapist.  It's some guy that they know.  Because normally, you just hang up.  And this guy goes on and on.  I'll get a restraining order.  It actually sounds like Dave Dickless.  I wouldn't put that past.  Hey, guys.  I want to participate in one of your wacky comedy bits.  Oh, Anthony, Dave's not in town today.  Oh, I know. 
[00:09:00]  He's not in town today.  I know.  You were explaining a few things to me in the office.  And...  Well, let's just put it this way.  One of the goals we've been shooting for.  No, let's just put it this way.  We did very well in the ratings, and we should move on now.  Come on, man.  What?  It's kind of a goal we've been shooting for.  Even though, relatively speaking, we haven't been in Boston on our latest stint there for a long time. 
[00:09:30]  But it is one of the goals we were shooting for.  And just to see that there's talk and something might be happening, I think you should...  Well, let's just put it this way.  You should explain it.  We like talking about the inside stuff of radio.  Yes, very fun.  When the ratings come out for a radio station, it is very, very important to the whole staff, obviously.  And the program director makes sure he's in town when the ratings come in.  So he could go over the ratings with his people and the sales staff and, you know, kind of look over all the numbers. 
[00:10:00]  Dave's not in town today.  No.  Hello.  He's not in town.  He's in...  Ah!  What?  Would you just explain it?  Ah!  You don't have to say who you were talking to.  Let's just put it this way.  Anthony and I know a lot of people in this business now. 
[00:10:30]  And it's got back to us from a very good source.  Yeah.  That Dave is looking for Rocco's replacement.  Right.  Thank you.  And I know that a certain individual has been asked to send his...  His...  His tapes.  Tapes.  Mm-hmm.  That's all I'm saying.  And can we...  Is it safe to assume that there may be an informal meeting? 
[00:11:00]  While he's out of town, let's say.  All right.  We can leave it at that.  Let's just put it this way.  He...  He will be making a stopover before he gets back.  Oh!  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  That's good.  Like I said, one of our goals...  It's no secret.  This is no secret.  One of our goals has been to get Rocco... 
[00:11:30]  Fired.  Him and Dave.  Thrown out.  Right.  And Dave.  For turning their backs on us.  And Dave, let me tell you something, Dave.  You're not in town, but this will get back to you, Dave.  Once you throw Rocco's fat ass out of that seat, it's not going to stop there.  There's a domino effect.  And you, eventually, will get your ass thrown out, too.  And that will be such a happy day for the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't see that happening anytime soon, especially with the great numbers she got in December, Anthony. 
[00:12:00]  No!  Right, Dave?  And we told Rocco, we said, look, man, your only hope is to stop, you know, listening to Dave.  But you continue to listen to Dave.  You allow him to fire your partner.  You allow him to tell you what to do on the air.  You allow him to tell you to shut the F up when we talk about you.  Yes, everything, all those things you did, Rocco.  It's coming back at you now. 
[00:12:30]  We told you what to do to, you know, stay in the game.  You turn your back on your partner like that.  That's what happens, Rocco.  That's what happens.  You turn your back on one partner and then you allow Dave to hire the guy across the hall  and make believe it was some guy in the stands at Fenway.  Cute.  Another fake radio bit.  Well, you know something, Boston?  Thank God you have completely restored my faith.  Because I was under the impression that you guys enjoyed that fake radio and that we were screwed. 
[00:13:00]  I really was.  Because I doubt Opie and I were going to change and start doing the fake Rocco radio bits.  Let's just put it this way.  A lot of people have called us to congratulate us today.  And they're calling it the comeback of comebacks.  Yeah.  As far as ratings go in one period.  It was looking grim, you bastards.  You had to shake us up a bit, didn't you?  You shook us up.  You were funning with us, weren't you?  You made us prepare for our show.  You sons of bitches. 
[00:13:30]  You made us get a little bit of a format.  Right.  And Opie, just when we're really starting to feel good about the show,  Washington ratings come out next week.  Oh yeah, Tuesday I believe.  And put us right back down to earth.  Thank you.  Before the Washington ratings?  Yeah.  On Monday?  Monday, what do we got?  Cleveland.  Cleveland!  I'm feeling good things.  We'll see what happens with the Cleveland ratings on Monday.  I ain't saying a thing until they come out.  Opie, I'm getting married. 
[00:14:00]  Why don't we have a bachelor party and a wedding?  Oh, God.  Are you kidding me?  So there you have it.  Yeah, the Boston ratings are out.  And we are more gooder.  The ratings are out and it looks like somebody there at AAF is going to be out too.  Well, you know.  Hey, I'm not saying anything.  I'm not going to lie.  I don't know that much.  I just know people have been contacted.  Okay, let me say this.  From what you told me in the office, I'd be nervous.  I'd be nervous.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  That's all.  I'd be pretty.  I'd be a little nervous.  Oh, yeah.  Not for us.  No.  No.  If I was Rocco, hell yeah.  Because the person they're thinking of is a joke too.  Right.  So don't worry about it.  But that's right.  That's typical Dave Douglas.  Just put it off.  Put off the inevitable.  Keep just throwing people into the meat grinder to save your own ass.  Did that with us.  And eventually it'll catch up with you too, Dave.  And you'll be out. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  And we've got to thank Edipus and Tony at BCN.  Do we do?  Oh, we do.  They're going to think we don't like them, Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Not saying that.  I know they like us and they enjoy the program and they're very happy with things.  It's just if I could make an analogy.  Yes, we're being treated very well at BCN and we enjoy being there.  And they're definitely liking the success.  But it's just like walking up to a house and knocking on the door for three years. 
[00:15:30]  And then they treat you nice when you finally get in.  Well, they should open the door a little sooner.  They had their reasons.  All right.  The house was being remodeled.  A little easier for you to get over than me.  The house was being remodeled.  I definitely like being at BCN.  Of course.  Anthony.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  Well, there's a bunch of people that want to say hi real fast.  We have Nicole, the virgin, who's supposed to come in, but boyfriend doesn't want to.  Oh, come on now.  We'll talk to her in a few minutes here.  Brianna, what's going on?  It's Rhiannon.  Come on now.  It says Brianna on the screen.  That's their problem.  All right.  What's up, Brianna?  I was just calling.  I'm in Boston.  Every day I listen to your show, obviously.  Every day when we're flipping through the radio stations trying to find music during the 
[00:16:30]  day, all I hear on WAF is 45 hours of talk radio on BCN.  It's horrible.  We have more music and blah, blah, blah.  And then they plug, you know, their shows and everything, but their shows just aren't  good for me.  Well.  It's like you guys have sex on there, which a lot of girls don't care for on the radio.  I think it's great.  Can I tell you something about that?  What?  We love talking about this inside stuff.  Jocks hate it when the station will brag that they play the most music.  Of course. 
[00:17:00]  Because that means they are useless and that monkeys could do their job.  No, I'm serious.  You can watch your management saying, hey, we don't have faith in our on air personalities  talking or anything.  So they will play as much music as is humanly possible.  Yeah.  Because we're afraid if they talk, the ratings are going to go down.  That's what they're saying.  And they tell their jocks, look, look, you know, get behind this.  It's cool, blah, blah, blah.  But it's basically saying, shut your mouths, play the music.  You guys suck. 
[00:17:30]  Anyone can do your job.  Exactly.  Well, like in the afternoons when I'm in the office, I just listen to you guys and it's  just like, I've occasionally flip back and forth if you guys are on commercial or whatever  and I just, it's not even funny.  But people are doing that less because we have less commercial.  Right.  More good or less commercial.  Yes, you do.  More good or less commercial.  I actually timed it the other day.  Yeah, because you didn't believe us.  I just think it's funny.  All right.  Radio wars.  But you guys take it easy this weekend. 
[00:18:00]  No war.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I know.  I know.  Well, they're calling what we're doing to the Taliban a war, too.  Right.  Yeah.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you want to label it a war.  Sure.  Thank you, Ryan.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to officially welcome you back to Boston.  What?  You waited to see how the ratings did?  Well, we were a little worried about you guys.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I also wanted to give a message to Rocco.  Mm-hmm.  ONA always win in the end.  Thank you.  Thank you, Enigma.  Take care.  Bye.  Hey, what do we do, Dave?  Dave, could you fire Matty?  And I'll get a new partner.  We'll go to Foxboro.  Foxboro, I'll pick a seat, you ass.  What a jackass.  So, if you see him down there at the Worcester Centrum, congratulate him on his fine showing  in the ratings. 
[00:19:00]  And, I don't know, tell him where maybe he could find a Kinko's.  Get that resume in order.  Rocco's calling in.  Rocco.  Hey, this is Rocco.  Hey.  You guys are killing me in the ratings.  I thought maybe I'd just call in your show and ask the new listeners.  That's a good idea, Schlocko.  So, I'm just going to do my show over the phone.  How does Dave feel about that?  Oh, I don't care what Dave feels about.  Wow.  You got some balls now.  Look at you with balls.  You can't ruin me anyway.  I need a new show.  See, now I know it's not, Rocco, because this guy has some balls. 
[00:19:30]  Don't talk too bad about Dave.  He's going to give you another fake suspension.  He's not listening right now.  He's in LA.  Maybe you guys could get me on your show.  You know, put me in a seat in the garden.  I'll be the new one.  Yeah.  I'll be the new one.  I'll be the new one.  There you go.  Now, Bersi already tried that.  We said no, thank you.  I got to go, guys.  All right, Rocco.  There he goes.  Rocco.  It's nice of him to call.  Look at that.  Oh, Jason with some info.  Jason, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Is Rocco's new replacement going to be Steven Baldwin?  Steven Baldwin.  Shh.  Shh.  I better hang up before too much info gets out.  Steven Baldwin, huh?  That's great.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Rocco's next move should be to fake his own death, I think.  Hey.  I'm going to be dying all this week.  Stay tuned.  When you hear me die sometime in the five o'clock hour.  Hey, later, guys. 
[00:20:30]  Little Tom broke off, Anthony.  You know what?  Now that Dave is away from that station, I'm sure they're doing some wacky break into Dave's  office and steal some tickets that you can win.  Oh, God.  How sad.  All right, Anthony.  Someone checking in to congratulate us.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to NBC Nightly News.  Things looking bad for Rocco in Boston radio. 
[00:21:00]  Seems he can't pull ratings out of that fat ass of it.  ONA kicking the crap out of him.  Hmm.  Maybe I could use some ideas that ONA used to win in Boston, to win against Dan Rather.  Tom broke off, NBC Nightly News, looking for Virgin.  I want a Virgin to get effed on my show.  Why am I saying effed when I have a bleep? 
[00:21:30]  Tom broke off, NBC, mother f***ing Nightly News.  Hey, there's that guy from Hogan's Heroes on the phone.  I'm going to call him a f***.  No, no, no.  That's all right.  That's all right.  We're up to 12 complaint calls about that one.  Yes, Opie.  Another story that's breaking as we start our radio show today.  I've got to agree.  One of those complaints?  Me. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I actually called to complain about the show.  Well, I think the other cities are getting bored with this, but we, you know.  That's great.  We just want to thank Boston.  Well, it's great.  Got some really good news today.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Less than 2% of all the radios on right now are listening to our old radio station.  Yeah.  Anthony, Nicole, the Virgin is on hold.  We'll talk to her next, okay?  Yes.  As we go to break, one of our listeners from Toronto, of all places, yeah, sent this in. 
[00:22:30]  It's a guy that's very unhappy about the Malcolm X stamp.  The stamp?  Yeah.  And he decided to call the post office.  All right.  And complain.  So check this out as we go to break.  Hello?  Yes.  Is this the post office?  Yes, it is.  Yes, I was calling about this new Malcolm X stamp.  Yes?  Well, I was just wondering, whose idea was it to put a militant on a stamp? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know, sir.  Well, I mean, Malcolm X, he advocated violence.  Well, Elvis Presley was a drug addict.  It wasn't our choice, okay?  Whose choice was it?  Can I help you?  Yes, I was calling.  I had some questions about the Malcolm X stamp.  Excuse me?  I mean, Malcolm X advocated the use of violence.  I mean, is that the kind of person we want on a postage stamp?  This is not where you called.  Jesus Christ.  Our postal workers are violent enough without a goddamn Malcolm X stamp egging them on. 
[00:23:30]  Would you like another phone number, sir?  Because you're calling here and you're discussing matters that we just don't have anything to do with you.  You've got your mailman driving around with a truck full of Malcolm X stamps,  and pretty soon he starts hearing little voices.  Heal the white man.  Heal the white man.  Heal the white man.  Sir?  Heal the white man.  Next thing you know, he's up on a water tower with a goddamn M-16.  Hello?  Come on, can I help you?  Couldn't we have put a less violent black man on a stamp? 
[00:24:00]  Um...  About Malcolm Javon Warner.  I could deal with that.  I still wouldn't buy it, but I could deal with it.  I've already heard your story that you do not like the Malcolm X stamp.  But...  Why do you keep calling us and asking us?  Because you already don't like the black militant...  I mean, look, it's not a racial thing.  I'm surprised the black people aren't protesting too.  Paying a black man 33 cents to take a letter all the way across the country.  It's just another example of a man keeping a brother down.  I have your name, sir. 
[00:24:30]  My name is Joe.  Okay, Joe.  You cannot call this officer and argue with us about the stamps that are made.  Look, look, look.  You don't understand.  This stamp is causing me all kinds of problems.  I've had to clean out another desk drawer just so I can segregate my stamps.  Joe?  Now, mind you, that drawer is just as good as my other stamp drawer.  It's just separate.  Joe?  No mixing of the stamps in my house.  Separate, but equal.  Yeah, what is your last name?  Look, look.  My wife licked a Malcolm X stamp yesterday.  She got jungle fever, took off with a garbage man. 
[00:25:00]  I haven't seen her since.  Hello?  Good morning.  May I help you?  Look, the last thing we need is a goddamn militant stamp with an agenda.  It was not a militant, okay?  You know, I sent off for a Civil War chess set 12 weeks ago,  and my letter had a Malcolm X stamp on it.  And you know what?  No.  I never got that chess set.  Coincidence?  You are holding up my phone, sir.  I don't think so.  What more do you need from this number?  From this number?  We need some equal time here.  How about a George Wallace stamp? 
[00:25:30]  Hello?  May I help you?  Yes, sir.  We seem to have been disconnected.  Now look, I got a way to deal with this Malcolm X stamp.  Sir?  I just put a James Earl Ray stamp on the other end of the envelope,  and let nature take its course.  Joe?  Dead letter office, if you know what I mean.  Hello?  May I help you?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  I put a Marilyn Monroe stamp next to a Malcolm X stamp,  and he tried to rape her.  I mean...  Hello?  Come on.  May I help you?  Look, uh... 
[00:26:00]  I mean, what kind of name is Malcolm X anyway?  I mean, there ain't no names that start with X.  Excuse me?  What was he?  Malcolm Xylophone?  Hello?  Come on.  May I help you?  I'm concerned Malcolm X stands for Malcolm X-lex.  Because I use that stamp to wipe my ass.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, this is David Wells,  and you're listening to the Op-Op-Op-Ny...  Op-Ny...

Leaving death and destruction in its wake.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Brian from Boston.  Talking about the ratings.  We did very well in Boston today, Anthony.  Thank you, Boston.  Brian writes, that's from all the show prep, you tools.  Yeah, that must be it.  It can't be the 6 o'clock queef, because we just came up with that. 
[00:28:00]  I can't wait to see the next ratings now.  With the addition of things like the 6 o'clock queef.  That should reflect in the next ratings period.  Oh.  Oh.  And this, right off the AP, Anthony.  Breaking news from Boston.  It's got to be true.  It says AP in parentheses.  AP means true.  AP reporting, Boston denounces fake radio.  More gooder, always good. 
[00:28:30]  They used more gooder on the AP?  I think they quoted you.  Good.  More gooder is more gooder.  More gooder, always good.  Eddie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you, don't worry about the ratings in D.C.  Yeah.  Because there's nowhere else to go but up.  You know what I mean?  Is that it?  Dude.  Yeah.  There's a couple people listening, man.  I see more O and A stickers, more wow stickers all the time.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, man.  That's funny.  Hey, Anthony, Louie Anderson checking in.  Louie!  Hey, fellas.  Hey, Louie.  Hey, Louie.  Hey, how's it going?  Pretty good, Louie.  Hey, the old feud thing just isn't working out for old Louie there.  So I thought maybe we could get off on the right foot there.  I'm going to be taking over for Rock Hope.  How are you, Louie?  Yeah, and, you know, Dave Dick, I mean, Douglas told me he'd, you know, he'd give me all the  free homo, I mean, ho-ho's. 
[00:29:30]  Ho-ho's, right.  I don't want it.  Ho-ho's, ho-ho's.  What are you going to be doing on the show?  Well, I thought it could be a, you know, sort of a family thing like the feud, but I know  your fans can be pretty abusive, and I hope they're not going to drive by the station  and throw whiskey bottles at me like my father.  Is it going to be funny?  Well, I don't know.  You guys are pretty competitive, but I think I could top the rock hole there.  What are you going to, how are you going to get the comedy? 
[00:30:00]  Well, I find comedy in tragedy.  Very good.  Okay, fellas.  You find comedy in tragedy.  I just thought maybe, you know, we could get off on the right foot, you know, and that  there could be no Hannah Mott to eat.  All right, Louie.  No, no problem.  And it's going to be, mine's going to be a family-oriented show.  Well, you're going to want to still do Ash Whipping Wednesday where you're fantastic.  Oh, God, Louie loves the man ass. 
[00:30:30]  Louie loves the man ass.  See, so you can do that.  Oh, yeah.  Like they have a segment where they bring men into the studio and get their asses whipped.  Oh, Louie loves the man ass, fellas.  Maybe we could give a little hint.  But I'm not a homo.  Give a little hint to Rocco.  I don't think that works.  Shh.  I don't think that works.  Louie loves the ass.  Louie's going to stick with the idea of ass whipping Wednesday.  Hey, look, we really got Louie Anderson on the phone. 
[00:31:00]  Louie loves Rocco, even though he's going to take his job.  But the feud just ain't working out there.  All right, Louie.  Thank you.  Thank you, fellas.  All right, there he goes, Louie Anderson.  Hey, it's Louie.  Louie's calling us.  All right.  The star of the show is on the line.  Yeah.  We have a very busy show today.  We've got Tom Hanks' son coming in with Jack Black.  We love Jack Black.  Colin Hanks.  Colin Hanks.  From last night on, what the hell talk show was he on? 
[00:31:30]  Was he on Conan?  No.  Yeah.  Was it Conan?  I don't know.  Leno and Letterman?  Yeah, one of the two.  It was Conan, and then Jack Black was on Letterman.  Letterman.  Yeah, Jack Black admitted on Letterman last night.  What?  Who?  Yeah.  I thought it was Letterman.  They're all over.  Huh?  He was on Letterman.  It was Letterman.  Yeah.  And Jack Black was telling David Letterman that his mom is like this big wig,  scientist.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I heard that.  That helped on the Hubble Telescope.  The Hubble Space Telescope.  We're going to have to ask him about that.  Mom's a rocket scientist.  Their movie, Orange County, opens today, I guess.  And Colin Hanks, of course, everyone knows who his dad is, but you know his mom was on  a Brady Bunch episode?  Oh, the cheerleader.  She was one of Marcia's friends, yeah.  They were like, hey, Nicole.  I was like, yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Nicole, don't talk so much.  Nicole.  You're up.  We hear you.  We'll get to you, Nicole.  Relax.  We're setting up the whole show here.  You guys going to hear me?  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  And also, Rich Voss coming in. 
[00:32:30]  I got to take the bed with the goods.  With Patrice, though.  Patrice is very funny.  We've never had him on the show.  We like Patrice.  He kills in the clubs here in New York.  And Nicole is supposed to come by to lose her virginity.  Nicole.  And we have her on the line.  Nicole.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  I thought he was going to be down to go.  And we were trying to convince him yesterday, Dougie and I.  Right.  And I don't know.  He always listens to your station.  And he's in the city right now. 
[00:33:00]  And he's supposed to be listening to you guys right now.  So he's probably listening to me.  You're the 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  Virgin, yes.  And you want to lose your virginity live on our show.  We're trying to get as many virgins to lose their virginity between now and Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  And your faggot boyfriend doesn't want to take your virginity away?  It's not that he doesn't want to take my virginity.  I don't know if he thinks that, like, I don't know.  I don't know if he thinks I'm lying or anything.  But I don't know.  I want you guys to try to help me convince him.  I don't know how, but.  Well, can we get him on the line? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  He's in the city listening to you guys.  So I don't know how you're going to get him on the line.  He's probably listening to you guys right now.  Where are you right now?  I'm right now at home.  Why don't you come down and beg from the station?  Can we go over there and beg?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to leave right now to go to your station.  Leave right now.  Who knows what's going to happen?  Come on.  If he's already in the city.  We're going to make it cool.  He knows he's not going to have to do it in front of everybody, right?  Yeah, he doesn't have to do it in front of people.  Okay.  So then you guys have to help me convince him.  Huh? 
[00:34:00]  I need your help to help me convince him.  Get your virgin ass in here.  Nicole, you get down here.  All right.  I'm leaving right now.  That's half the battle.  You get down here and then we'll worry about everything else.  All right.  Dougie and I are leaving right now.  All right.  Who's Dougie?  Dougie is the guy that's bringing me to drive me.  So why doesn't Dougie do you?  No, because he's like my best friend.  Yeah, best friend.  Dougie's the next guy in line when she breaks up with a boyfriend.  Believe me.  Dougie.  I bet your boyfriend loves friggin' Dougie.  I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  What were you doing today? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, me and Dougie.  Oh, Dougie.  Enough with the Dougie, okay?  All right.  We're going to go.  We're going to leave now.  Guys were not meant to hang out with ladies unless they were doing them.  Well, who had that bit?  I'm not going to claim the bit, but it's brilliant.  Who, Chris Rock?  Chris Rock, man.  With the blank.  Platonic friendship.  With the blank under the glass?  Yeah.  It's the in case of emergency break glass thing.  I mean, a girl that has, oh, we're such good friends.  A guy never wants a girlfriend with a very close male friend. 
[00:35:00]  It doesn't.  And any guy that says he's happy.  Bull crap.  Any guy that says he's happy with his girlfriend having a close friend relationship with a guy  is lying because he knows damn well the second things get a little rocky in the relationship,  that's who she's running to.  That's who's zipper's coming down.  And that's going to be the first guy plowing her when, uh...  But more importantly, like, Nicole, Dougie is, uh, staying close because he wants you.  Right.  Right.  There is no doubt in my mind.  I have never even met Dougie, I don't think. 
[00:35:30]  It was like Chang with the other girl we had, uh, earlier in the week.  Oh, uh, the girl that did the wiffle ball matchup.  The Chinese guy.  Oh, okay.  He is constantly thinking of doing you.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  But he probably has respect for, uh, for, uh, your relationship that you have now.  No, he doesn't.  You don't think?  Believe me, any opportunity, if Nicole turned around to him today and said, let's go, he  wouldn't think twice about it.  Oh, no, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  Definitely absolute.  All right, get in here.  All right, we're going to leave right now, okay, guys? 
[00:36:00]  I'll see you guys in a little while.  All right, 19-year-old Nicole, the, uh, portly convergent.  Where are you guys right now?  Hold on a line.  Right now.  Well, right now, where we are every day for three and a half years.  Right now.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, you, uh, this bit with Nicole is like a Rocco bit.  I mean, there's no such thing as a 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  Are you accusing us of doing fake radio?  Hey!  And this setup is just all off.  There's no such thing.  All right, talk to you guys later.  All right, guys. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  There it goes, Kevin.  Oh, uh, Anthony, Ozzy Osbourne.  Oh, really?  Ozzy!  Hey!  Hello, uh, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  How are you guys, then?  Hey, what's up, Ozzy?  No, no, you know, man, I just want to tell you, man, that I really like your show, man.  I called before, you know.  Goddamn, this is the best Ozzy I've ever heard.  Yeah, we know you've called before.  So, so, you know, Opie, man, how are you?  I'm doing, you know, you do, you do quite a nausea yourself, man. 
[00:37:00]  No, I like the impression you're doing with me, man.  You know, it's very flattering.  No, I also wanted to say hello to Norton because I know he's a fan of mine.  Well, he's not here today.  Oh, man, you know, I almost dropped the F-bomb there, but I remember you got the delay, man.  Yeah, say helicopter, Ozzy.  Helicopter. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, no, man, I definitely think, you know, you did quite the Ozzy Osbourne yourself, man.  Okay, why?  So, Ozzy, what are you up to?  Are you in New York City right now?  No, man, you know, I'm on Long Island, man.  That's where Ozzy hangs.  Yeah, he's on a mastic beach.  No, you know, I'll do you one better, Anthony, you know. 
[00:38:00]  I'm in St. James right now.  St. James.  Yeah.  I wanted to tell you that, you know, that I've taken this band under my wing, man.  You know, they're called Shattered Remains.  They're very good.  There you go.  Well, that's great, Ozzy.  You know, I plan on, you know, talking to you guys more.  You know, I like you guys a lot.  Yeah, give us a call from time to time, Oz.  All right, man, you know.  All right.  Thank you, Ozzy.  There he goes, Ozzy. 
[00:38:30]  Take care, guys.  All right.  Wow.  A lot of celebrities checking in today, Anthony.  Oh, man.  That was pretty good.  That's the one I used to call us.  Yeah.  Yeah, he sounds good.  Sounds like Ozzy.  He's too coherent, though.  I understood every single word that guy said.  True.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  I'm a little confused here.  Why?  Yeah.  This girl wants to beg this guy.  You have to beg a guy to bang a 19-year-old virgin?  I know.  This guy needs a bullet to break.  That makes sense.  Well, that's why I want to talk to the guy. 
[00:39:00]  If he's listening, I hope he calls the show, because I want to see what he's all about.  I think he should never get laid as long as he lives.  See you, guys.  All right, Uncle John.  I mean, there's no way that guy should.  Yeah, unless he's gay.  Lisa.  Yeah.  What's up, please?  Hi.  Hey.  Is this O&A?  Yeah.  Yep.  I tried to call you so many times.  I have a lot of guy friends that I've been friends with for years, and you make it sound  like we bang all of them. 
[00:39:30]  We don't.  I've heard a lot of guys that don't want to date me because of my guy friends, and you  are not helping my cause.  How hot are you?  I say you're about a nine, right?  I'm going to go with eight.  Eight?  Seven and a half, eight.  And you have a lot of guy friends?  Yeah.  Those are all guys that want to do you.  Listen, I've been to a bunch of them, and I'm not afraid to admit that getting drunk and  hanging at friends is fun.  They're wonderful between boyfriends.  Yeah.  But there are couples that I don't cross that line with that I will be friends with forever. 
[00:40:00]  But you said couples.  Yep.  Yeah, there's a few.  I'm talking about single guys hanging out with you, and they just want to be friends.  No, they're single.  They're totally single.  But there's other...  And they just want to be friends.  No way.  No way.  No.  No way.  No.  They're just lying about it.  No, they're not.  They're trying to be gentlemen about it.  Yep.  No way.  Listen, these have been guys that have carried me home, wasted, drunk, put me in bed and left.  All right. 
[00:40:30]  Name one of the...  And they're not gay.  Name one of the guys.  Mike.  Mike.  Okay.  You're trying to tell me, if you invited Mike over, like, hey, Mike, you want to come  over as friends and maybe watch Friends and we'll make some popcorn, and he shows up and  you're in your hottest, like, lingerie or something, he's going to go, dude, what are  you doing, and leave?  We talked about it.  But if I...  Sorry, sorry.  No, I got F-bomb.  That's okay.  I can't.  Help it.  We don't want to F up the friendship by F-ing.  But just that you have talked about means that that's what he wants. 
[00:41:00]  And that's your choice.  You don't want to F up the friendship.  He doesn't want a friendship.  He wants your...  There are other friends that...  He wants your...  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  This is an absolute...  No, I don't want to listen to you.  You're rooting for girls right now.  It's an absolute...  It's an absolute.  This is not something that is a sometimes thing.  If you are a girl, and you have a heterosexual male friend, he wants to have sex with you. 
[00:41:30]  No.  Yes, he does.  Period.  Definitely.  Period.  There may be an...  No.  No.  Excuse me.  There may be an exception to the rule, but...  The only exception is if he's in a relationship.  I would say, well...  And then, sometimes he wants...  Most of the times he wants to have sex with you.  I would put the percentage above 99%.  That's not true.  Yep.  99%.  99.999 if you want some kind of a variable.  It's people like you that make guys run the other way.  Oh, it's people like us that...  It's the truth.  No.  Your girlfriend...  If you're a guy, and your girlfriend has a very good male friend, they go out and hang 
[00:42:00]  out, he wants to F her.  The only thing keeping him from F-ing her is your girlfriend, and the minute it gets a  little rocky, they will have sex.  Your mom.  Nope.  He wants your puha, and possibly your...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe I could teach you in the gym, girl.  Bah, bah.  No.  No, Rick.  Yes, Rick.  She's missing something totally... 
[00:42:30]  Right on the face of it.  He agreed...  Lisa, you're saying he agreed, and said, I don't want to do this to F up the relationship,  right?  It's not just one.  I have a friendship.  Hold on.  Did he say that?  He agreed with you, right?  Well, he thought that it would mess up the friendship, obviously.  Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, just the fact that you guys have discussed it means that where his  mind is at, I'm friends with Anthony, and Rick, and Ben, and Big Kev, and Keith.  We have never discussed doing each other! 
[00:43:00]  Right now, I'm saying that you want Anthony.  What?  What'd you say?  I said you're coming out of the closet right now and saying that you want Anthony.  No.  Yeah, that's what everyone's getting to.  Yeah, that's...  You're either delusional, or you're just lying.  Oh, no, I'm not.  All right.  I'm there.  Ask this great male friend of yours if he wants to have sex.  Say, you want to do it, Lisa?  I don't know, I'm feeling like...  Like, lead him on, and it will take you three seconds before he has his pants down. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  But there are just people that aren't attracted to each other.  Oh, stop it.  You're thinking like a woman.  You'd think like a guy, there is no such thing about not being attracted to each other  when it comes to just sticking it somewhere.  That's so pleasant.  But how the way it is.  I guarantee we talk to the guy on the air, he'll admit to us that he wants to do you.  Guarantee?  That is a guarantee.  And we don't even know the guy.  Uh-huh.  You get him to call us right now.  As long as he's hetero.  No, that's not that he can't.  I'll even go one step further. 
[00:44:00]  I think even a bunch of the gay guys that hang out with these girls want to do them.  Sure.  All right, I'll give that one.  I smooch my gay best friend a lot when we're drunk.  All right, Lisa, thank you.  See, gay best friends.  Thank you, Lisa.  No problem.  Have a good weekend.  You freaking girls are out of your minds if you think that good male friends do not want  to have sex with you.  Of course they do.  Zach.  Yeah.  You're on the radio.  What's going on, man?  Yeah, my girlfriend, all her friends are effing guys, and it pisses me off to no end. 
[00:44:30]  You have no idea.  Really?  Yeah.  No, why?  Because you can look in the eyes of all those guys, and you know everyone's dropping the  F and S bombs on this conversation.  Yeah.  You know something?  Do you have friends that are girls?  Yeah.  How many?  Plenty.  You allowed to go out with them without your girlfriend being around?  Not really.  Does she go out with the boyfriends?  Yeah.  Ah.  The frig is going on.  Oh, whoa. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Dude.  Dude.  What are you doing?  What do you mean, what am I doing?  Go out with your girlfriends without your chick.  Oh, I do go out with them.  Good.  Do you want to have, do you want to have, would you ever think, or have an urge to have sex  with some of your girlfriends?  Hmm.  If they all of a sudden came up to you, and, okay, thank you.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right, Zach.  Any guy who says that he wouldn't, come on.  All right.  It's ridiculous.  Thank you, Zach.  All right, have a good one. 
[00:45:30]  Bye.  Let's go to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Thanks.  These women that have these guy friends think they're so gullible that the guy won't put  up anything.  Yeah, we know your problem.  Come here, over and hang out.  I know you're going through a rough time here.  Cry on my shoulder, but if they had the chance, like the scorpion, to jump on the dead animal,  they would.  Exactly.  You ever see the alligator, the bison cross the water with the, and the alligators, they  jump up and get them in a second.  And they don't really care about the friendship.  The girls can stay friendly with the guys more than the guys can stay friendly with the 
[00:46:00]  girls.  Guys can smell vulnerability.  Exactly.  And we'll stick around here.  Cry on my shoulder.  Come on over.  You know what you do?  What do you want to do?  Wear some sweatpants.  So, we'll just hang out.  Yeah, yeah.  Sweatpants.  I know you're playing a snake charming music.  Big Jake will come up.  Aw, lay your head in my lap and I'll brush your hair.  Yeah, let me hold your head.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Guys are insane.  This girl calls up. 
[00:46:30]  She, she, like, I can't accept the fact that she actually believes that.  I'm thinking when she was talking to us on the phone just minutes ago, she's knowing  in her head, yeah, they're right.  And that's a line guys use.  Oh, I don't want to F up the friendship.  That's because it's a different angle, but he's still trying to get into your pants just  from a different angle.  He's waiting for the sure thing.  Exactly.  I don't want to F up, not the friendship.  I don't want to F up my chance to F you.  So, I'll wait for the perfect opportunity.  Wait a little longer.  He'll put in a little more time, a little more effort.  Vanessa.  We're pigs, ladies.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  I have to tell Lisa she's out of her freaking mind because I was in that same situation.  You know, my friend said, you know, oh, never, nothing between us.  Until I came crying to him one night about my then ex, we ended up together.  And, of course, he doesn't really want me to have male friends.  Well, because he knows.  Well, Jesus.  He has a male friend.  That's cool.  That says it all right there.  The acquaintance thing, you know, hey, how you doing, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:47:30]  The second they're going out and doing things or, you know, oh, he's over the house and we're chatting and stuff or we're watching videos or something.  It's over, Johnny.  You know what's going to happen.  Or he's hoping.  Caroline, Brian, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hey.  I just wanted to, I promise I won't curse.  Seems like everybody else has been.  Yeah.  But I just wanted to let Anthony know, I don't want him to make a fool of himself.  It's not Colin Hanks' mother who's in the Birdie Bunch.  It's his stepmother, Rita Wilson. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Colin Hanks is married to now.  You know, I saw what you were going to say and I went to the Internet Movie Database and I looked and, yes, indeed, he was married to this Samantha Lewis, her name was?  Lewis?  I don't know who his first wife is.  Yeah, until 85.  But how did you see what I was going to say?  Are you psychic?  Yeah.  No, well, actually, our screener typed it very clearly and plainly.  Oh, look at that.  And it seems that he was married up until 85.  Yeah, well, this guy, I mean, he's playing a high school kid, but he's 24.  So, you know, Rhea Wilson, I mean, maybe she's a little wrong on the tooth, but I don't think she's old enough to have a 24. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, I think she's pretty, uh.  Say that when the stepson's coming in?  Well, I'm just saying I don't think she's old enough to have a 24-year-old child.  Ah, all right.  Well, thank you for that.  I didn't mean to insult Rhea Wilson.  I think she's lovely.  That's okay.  Thanks for the info, though.  You're welcome.  Colin Hanks coming in with Jack Black in a little while.  We got our virgin on the way down.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  You guys are blowing it for us right now.  Why?  Why are we blowing it for you guys?  Because that's the perfect angle. 
[00:49:00]  You just wait and wait.  The other guy ups up and boom, you're in.  You strike.  It works like a charm every single time.  Yeah, we should keep our mouth shut.  You really should.  You're screwing it up.  No, it's not blowing anything.  This is a way to protect the guys.  This isn't one of the guy blow at things.  If you're a single guy and you're a friend with a girl.  Unless there's a ring, I think it's fair game.  Now she knows you want to bang her.  There you go.  We're doing a service.  I don't know.  More guys who get banged because of this?  I think so.  Great.  One more question for you, fellas.  Yeah.  When are you coming to Hartford? 
[00:49:30]  Hartford.  Hartford.  We need you in Hartford.  We got terrible talk radio up there.  I'll tell you, if we get a station in Hartford, we will rule the Northeast.  You can listen to the O.P. Anthony show from Boston all the way to Washington, D.C.  It'll be the best.  Hartford is just miserable.  Yeah, Hartford is a miserable place, man.  Thanks a lot, boys.  I'll talk to you later.  I don't know how we're going to fake that one when we get on the air up there.  Hartford.  Oh, my God.  What a depressing city that is to be in.  I've stopped in Hartford on my way to go skiing a bunch of times.  And I make sure I'm gassed up before I even go through. 
[00:50:00]  You're smart.  Believe me.  Top off the tank.  And if you get a flat, I'm on the rim until I see that city line.  Man.  Yeah.  The crackheads are afraid of Hartford.  I think we can make it to the Massachusetts border.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  Full of people that turn their guns sideways when they shoot.  They don't use the sights.  It's nice.  You miss your target and hit the little kids.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, we've got to give away the Royal Rumble trip.  We'll do that next.  Mm-hmm.  And the Virgin coming down.  Scott Farrell calling in.  Our new morning guy here in New York.  Oh, there you go.  We like the guy.  We'll talk to him about what's going on with the football this weekend.  And Hanks and Black coming in.  And Rich Voss and...  What about the midget?  Have we talked to the midget?  Oh, yeah.  The midget.  What's going on with the midget?  The tall midget.  She should be here by around 5 o'clock.  5 o'clock.  God damn.  Can't wait to see a midget.  No, we're going to go to break with... 
[00:51:00]  Hey, call it the blow me line.  That's what I do.  Before we take a break, a little bit of Pablo Francisco.  Ah.  He was in last Friday, and we think the guy killed for us.  So here he is.  Jackie Chan.  In the forbidden world of comedy, it takes one man to change a light bulb.  He traded his black belt for the Borscht Belt on amateur night.  His own government stared in the gone stage.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Jackie Chan.  Fight night at the Apollo.  Knock, knock. 
[00:51:30]  Who's there?  Beef.  Beef who?  Beef broccoli.  He does his own stunts.  But unfortunately, he does his own jokes.  Your mama's so fat.  How fat is she?  She's so fat, Buddha rubs her stomach for good luck.  I bet you like nuts on her chin.  No offense.  His name is Chin.  All right.  That's all Jackie Chan can do.  Oh, what?  Who, huh?  What happened? 
[00:52:00]  Who?  Oh, but he makes up for it when he picks that ladder up and starts kicking six guys' ass.  Oh, yeah.  He gets in fights for the most stupidest reasons.  Hey, you.  What are you eating?  I don't know.  I eat banana.  Get him.  Banana.  No.  No.  Nice guy.  He's just walking down the street.  Six guys decide to kick his ass.  Hey, what do you got in your pocket?  Wallet.  Get him.  Wallet.  No.  Friend.  Beating up him with a cotton candy machine.  What happened?  Spinning around.  His head's covered with big cotton candy. 
[00:52:30]  Punch him in the head.  He rolls him a russ.  All right.  Big cotton candy head and then hits him.  That's right.  You're going to melt in someone's mouth right now.  I'm on a roll.  What?  Egg roll.  Yo mama so fat, she used two by four as chopstick.  I wrote all those that jokes.  Who's there?  Orange.  Orange.  Orange.  Orange you got to kiss your ass.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Boo.  Boo who?  Cry baby.  Hey, what are you doing?  Praying to God and Jesus I love.  Get him. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, no.  No.  Go to church.  No.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  And Kyle from Philly writes, I smell new bit.  That must have been the 350 really naive girl bit. 
[00:53:30]  And Greg from Hoboken, a guy who doesn't want to F his girlfriends,  is as likely as, wow, he typed this really bad.  A guy who doesn't want to F his girlfriends is as likely as a 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  Man, did I blow that.  It looked good when I quickly read it.  Sorry about that.  Hate that guy from Long Island.  That's another thing.  When a boyfriend, when as the boyfriend, you say you have a friend who's a girl,  your girlfriend automatically thinks something would happen between you and that girl. 
[00:54:00]  But if it's our guy friends, they're different.  And they don't want her.  They don't want to F her.  No.  The guys want to have sex with you.  Jennifer.  Yes.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You guys are great.  Thank you, Jennifer.  I got to tell you, I think it's the same thing for girls as it's the guys.  Girls pick guys.  Wait, hold on.  Let me...  Well, Jennifer's saying that, what, you got some guy friends around that you're hoping to do? 
[00:54:30]  Well, sorry, but I pick...  Oh, man.  Her phone's out.  I see what she wants to say.  Girls do the same thing.  Friendly with hot guys hoping to bang them.  Not the same thing.  The hot guy's getting effed anyway.  He's getting effed when he goes out, everything.  If it's the hot guy, the girls think he's the hot guy, he's getting laid.  It doesn't matter if he's friends with other girls that this girl is friends with him, hoping to bang him.  It's not the same thing.  The guys that are friends with the girlfriends, they want to have sex with them. 
[00:55:00]  Because they're guys and they want to have sex with anything.  There are a lot of girls who keep guy friends just because they want to bang them also.  Well, there you go.  And that's when you're seeing someone else?  Excuse me?  Are you...  Never mind.  No, I'm not.  I am not.  I just happen to know I have a lot of friends who do keep a lot of guys close that they like to bang.  Okay.  Thank you, Jennifer.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Her phone's crapping out.  Hard to follow her. 
[00:55:30]  We've got to say hi to a new friend of the show, Anthony.  Scott Perel!  Shagging, fellas.  God, what's up, man?  I'm just sitting here drinking and listening to Metallica.  Jameson's on Friday.  It's smooth.  Smooth.  Like the Jameson's, huh?  You guys are crazy, man.  Who was banging who?  I'm all for it.  Well, it don't matter who it is.  We have a...  Check this one out, Scott.  We've got a 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin coming down to the studio.  She wants to lose her virginity today on our show, but her boyfriend is chickening out. 
[00:56:00]  Sweet for her and you, Slick.  What an idiot, right?  Look at that guy.  Somebody's got to give him one of these right across the head.  I know.  Get one of those and one of the thumb to the eye.  Why do you have to talk a guy into having sex with his 19-year-old virgin girlfriend?  I have a feeling because the guy thinks we're all going to just sit around and watch.  But no.  No.  It's like a circle jerk.  No, we've got all that Gandhi new furniture and those sweet, afted rugs and that lava Ferrella  lood lamp.  Yeah, what do you think of that?  I just cruised through that studio looking for that hottie blonde I've been after in there. 
[00:56:30]  There's a hottie blonde.  I don't even need to leave the building to get action.  In Manhattan, you can go about one block before you would leave your family.  Instantly, you'd leave everything.  Lay another line.  That's what I'm going to do this weekend on the playoff games, too.  I'm going to bet family members.  My dad's first on the docket.  Boom.  I'm betting him.  I'm going to bet everything on the house.  That's funny, man.  So you're digging the IKEA furniture.  Dude, you guys did a great job.  And you did a number on that pinball machine, too. 
[00:57:00]  Let me tell you what.  All I saw when I saw that damage was people dressed in plastic bags, directing traffic,  some kind of fashion.  That was some vandalism.  We had nothing to do with the IKEA furniture, though.  I was a rotten kid, too, man.  You know, the ratings came out for New York, and they sucked so bad, they've decided to  redecorate.  Redecorate.  Great.  That'll help things around here.  Now they actually brought Scott Farrell aboard, and we're going to do fine now.  Yeah.  Can you imagine that?  Hey, Scott, where are you right now?  In a hotel?  Yeah, I'm hanging out in the penthouse in a big suite over here on 34th. 
[00:57:30]  I'm curious, George.  I never knew Santa.  I'm down by 3rd and Long, where we suck down kettle screws and bet on football games  and hit on chicks with bad breath.  That sounds great, man.  There's no penthouses on 34th Street.  I try to set my producers up with Action Diner.  I got one of them laid.  She was wearing high tops.  You're living in one of those fleabag hotels right now? 
[00:58:00]  No, it's a five-star place.  It's like all the NHL teams stay here, and what happens is when the World Trades went  down, the Rangers were here, and I saw Messier and Lindros in front of the hotel, and I said,  you two look as stupid as me.  What are you going to do?  And then, you know, it's just a cool place.  I learned about it when I was doing hockey, and the teams stay here, and then, like, St.  John stays here.  And so, like, I see all these people.  I saw Bob Gibson here one night.  A lot of, you know, I think athletes know about it, and so I ended up staying here. 
[00:58:30]  Next thing you know, old Jed's a millionaire, and I was just, I fell in love with a couple  of the chicks at the front desk, and then I started working numbers and greasing up the  dudes downstairs in the health club.  Now I can't leave.  They won't even, like, they don't talk to me, but I'm not going anywhere.  We've kind of, like, settled in over here.  Yeah?  That's funny.  Wow, that's kind of a cool place to be.  They fill it up with booze for me, too, which is interesting.  And I've got a view of the East River so I can see bodies getting loaded in.  Hey, is it true you've got, like, six alarm clocks to try to get you up in the morning?  I've got action, boys. 
[00:59:00]  You think you've got bookie action.  What I've got is I've got two of them that run on batteries.  I've got two that are plugged in.  I've got the cell phone going off, and then I've got the chick at the front desk on the  take.  So I've got all of them ringing within one minute of each other, and it's like orchestral  maneuvers in the Pharrella.  Why?  Kind of hard getting up in the morning?  You know, I don't have much of a problem with that kind of action, but I know that once  I get over there, I just, I'm like you guys, I just start breaking stuff, and I have so 
[00:59:30]  much fun doing it that when I leave there is when I'm dangerous.  I usually go to Hard Rock and suck a couple of Johnny Rocks down.  When I leave there, I'm looking for free meals.  I haven't found any yet.  I've got a couple of death threats.  I saw some fat guy out there one day.  I like him, though.  He bets on games.  I was like, hey, what's up there, Woody?  He's got a knife.  Oh, Pharrell.  I'm like Monica Sellers.  So, Pharrell, how long do you think you're going to have the job before you blow yourself  up?  I don't know.  There's odds.  There's an over-under on if I'm going to have a stroke. 
[01:00:00]  I did it one day, and Blaine Ensley, who's just a freak of nature, he said to me, he said  I was turning colors, and I said, I'm a chameleon, and on one stage, I'm the Joker.  And then I played a song for him.  It kind of went like this.  He's cracking his tune.  Nice.  Yeah, Metallica.  Rock.  I can just picture a darn dingy room with Metallica playing, and he's drinking his booze. 
[01:00:30]  You've got to love that action.  Hold on, Scott.  You scare us.  It's Friday.  It's happy hour.  Sounds like you're in a hotel room by yourself just getting hammered.  You'd be surprised what I'm up to.  It's 420.  Ah, there you go.  We're over here hanging out.  We're going to go down, and we take over 3rd Street.  We try to find people to dig the show.  It takes us a while.  And then we just hang out and try to eat as much pasta as possible. 
[01:01:00]  Listen to the boys and, you know, rip a few.  Basically, Fridays and Saturdays are my, I'm sinister.  I'm like the Joker.  I believe it, man.  All right.  So, Scott, the rundown on the games, man.  What are you thinking?  Oh, I think the games are just going to be lethal.  It's going to be awesome watching them go down.  I think Tampa Bay is going to show up in Philadelphia.  They're going to be dancing.  The Eagles are going to be smacking heads with the Buccaneers.  Warren Sapp is going to be blitzing.  He's going to be on every play rolling over double teams.  They're going to be trying to take each other's heads off.  I think the Eagles are going to have it at the end of the game.  But I like Tampa Bay to cover. 
[01:01:30]  You've got to love the team that covers, because then you can go to the window  and look at the lady and say, I love when you give me cash, fat lady.  Do you sing, too?  And then at the end of the night, you're going to watch the Jets go out to Oakland.  And then, how should I say, coif.  It's coifing.  It's the coif of the week.  The Jets have been talking so much about how easy it's going to be.  They're going to go out there.  Their legs are going to feel like cement.  They're going to go out there and play.  The Raiders are going to show up, and they're going to do some blitzing.  Be careful, because I think they're going vertical on the Jets.  Game's close.  24-17. 
[01:02:00]  Raiders in the black hole.  You know what happens in the black hole.  We know what happens.  And then I like, over the other games, Miami and I are dangerous.  Take the number with them, and then whatever the other game is, I'm all for that team.  No, is this Vinny's last game as a Jets?  I hope so.  All I know is that the rest of the teams around here blow, so I'm just going with the full blow.  And the Packers and the Niners?  I think the Niners are going to show up, and I think Garcia.  I was talking to Billy Taylor, another guy that we raged with on the show. 
[01:02:30]  Billy Taylor.  He's so funny.  No, the bottom line is, he said the same thing.  He's like, you know, Jeff Garcia played in Canada, and Garrison Hurst is a badass, and  I think Terrell Owens is a guy that just has, like, I think he's got to stick them on his  fingers, and chicks dig him, because he's got the look, and he's all carved.  And watch for the same kind of game that they've always had.  Down to the wire, I like the Niners to definitely cover.  If the Packers win, they win by one.  Take the number and go like this.  I told you to sing, fat lady, sing.  I love to count money with my tongue. 
[01:03:00]  Listen.  Wow.  I'm loving you freaks.  I'm loving the fact that you're spending that big virus of yours and just kind of whipping  it around.  We're trying.  And dolphins and ravens, I forgot what you said.  I like the Dolphins to be in this game.  They've got a lot of tweaks and package tears and various little ailments.  But when they're in South Beach, they go to the Clevelander and get free hummers from  all the hotties down there. 
[01:03:30]  And they've got nude beaches.  I'm always taking the team with the nude bitches.  The Ravens will show up, and Elvis Garback is another pussy.  So forget him.  I don't bet on pussies.  I just like to go looking for him.  Shake it up.  Oh, man.  Hey, Pharrell, we like you, man.  Just don't OD before we can get some ratings around here.  Yeah, I'm all cool on this side.  You guys, I think you're beautiful, and I love listening to you.  And I have a lot of fun being around you.  You guys spread all kinds of vicious stuff.  I love it.  You guys are free.  Be cool.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  Thanks, Scott.  Thanks a lot, Scott.  There he goes.  Goddamn Pharrell, man.  In his penthouse suite on 34th Street.  How are you not at least checking that out in the morning?  Yes.  Holy Jesus.  We really got something going on, finally.  It's like 15 cups of coffee.  You got to check it out.  And Blaine's doing a great job with him.  Yeah.  Great job.  I thought Johnny Most died a while ago.  Steve from Boston writes that.  That is funny, man.  Hey, there's a local reference for Boston right there.  Sing badly.  That's great stuff, man. 
[01:04:30]  I just hope he doesn't OD before we get the ratings up in the mornings here.  Yeah, right?  He can party, that guy, man.  We need a break so bad here in New York.  We've had nothing in mornings for three and a half years.  Yeah.  Mornings has been a wasteland.  Matt Devote was crowing about his numbers in the morning.  That's how bad the morning numbers are now.  Matt Devote, the sales guy, who used to do...  He did the morning show for like...  He was a legend in New York.  Yeah.  He was like, you know my numbers were... 
[01:05:00]  I had a 2-3.  Well, he wrote them down.  Yeah.  And we were looking, going, wow, we'd take that today.  That would be huge right now.  We'd take that today.  He goes, and then they put in Manson and Kaczynski.  I believe it was Mason and Kaczynski.  I think Manson and Kaczynski would get good numbers.  That's a show I would listen to.  You'd have to listen.  All right.  You're the man.  Nicole, the 19-year-old Puerto Rican Virgin calling in again.  Nicole.  No, this is actually Dougie.  What's up? 
[01:05:30]  Hey, Dougie, the guy that wants to have Nicole.  Turn your...  No, I'm not like that.  Listen, we're on the L.A.  We're stuck in traffic.  I thought you guys...  I'm actually...  Say again?  I thought you guys were coming from Queens or something.  No, no.  We're coming from Long Island.  All right.  Well, you got two and a half hours to get here.  Yeah, we should be...  I'm driving like a maniac.  I'm on a side road cutting cars off and everything.  And Dougie, you got to talk to the boyfriend into doing this.  This is the showstopper today.  Yeah, we're on the...  We're trying to get him on the air.  We're actually probably going to call him from there and try to talk him into going. 
[01:06:00]  Well, you got to call from the car because we got to make this happen today.  All right.  Who am I talking to anyway?  Who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  No, but which one?  Opie.  All right, Opie.  We're on our way.  All right.  Good.  Thanks.  All right.  That's going to be a big...  Cluster F right there.  Let's check out the FU line as we break here.  Why not?  Let us do that.  And more of your phone calls.  We got Jack Black and Mr. Hanks.  Colin Hanks.  Colin Hanks coming in today to talk about Orange County and other things.  So, stick around.  Hey, thanks for calling. 
[01:06:30]  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big FU for my ex-girlfriend, Renee.  Renee, thank you for leaving me for your ex-boyfriend from five years ago, who's five years older  than you.  That's bald and looks like a bowling pin.  FU.  Next message.  This is DJ and I'm calling from Indiana and I wanted to give a big FU to WCKG in Chicago  because you motherfuckers start the Opie and Anthony show at nine o'clock at night. 
[01:07:00]  I have to stay up till one to listen to the whole f***ing show.  And that's only when you don't play the f***ing Chicago Wolves, supposedly pro-hockey league,  not even NHL, they're AHL.  It's a bull****** deal that you play hockey instead of O&A.  The Wolves suck.  Okay?  And in addition to that, quit censoring the show.  You suck, WCKG.  You suck.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU to my friend Vince, my best friend Vince, who I caught in 
[01:07:30]  bed with my girlfriend, I hate you, FU.  End of message.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You all have it.  Oh.  Opie, answer me.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.  It's starting to feel like a party in here, Anthony.  Yeah.  We got the dude from Classic Pinball stopping in to say hi.  He's going to bring us another pinball machine. 
[01:08:00]  He made us promise that we weren't going to F it up, and I got no problem making that promise.  One of my favorites of all time, the T2 pinball.  It's a great game.  And he's going to add the profanity chip, he said.  Yeah.  Where Arnold's curse is at you.  I told him.  You saw me.  Yeah.  I will not touch the T2 machine.  No, that's like a great game.  I'll play it, but I won't, you know, I won't smash it or anything. 
[01:08:30]  Good playing game.  The Rolling Stones game, Classic and everything.  It sucked as far as fun gameplay went.  Right.  T2 rocks.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston.  Boston.  We're just tuning in, we got great news from Boston.  We did real well in the ratings up there in Boston.  We're more gooder this time around, and I want to thank everyone up there.  More gooder.  We're supporting the show.  Rich Voss is in the studio. 
[01:09:00]  Voss, what's up, man?  He looks like a proud papa.  I'm not a proud papa.  Because he's introducing Patrice to Aunt Nye and our listeners.  Patrice is a really funny guy.  I met Patrice a few times there at Caroline's.  Probably one of the funniest comics out there.  He's a creep as a human.  Is he funnier than you?  Yes.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody who hasn't seen me and seen Voss, they know I'm funnier.  I like when Voss is plowing through the same old crap. 
[01:09:30]  It's awful, isn't it?  He won't write.  Lenny Bruce got more new jokes.  And he sells a CD with the same material that he said.  Voss won't.  Even his improvs is.  Voss improvs yesterday's stuff.  I came up with a couple new bits.  Go ahead, say one.  Give us one of your new bits. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  Let me think about, oh, here's a new one who really gets on my nerves.  Jared from Subway.  I hope he gains all his weight back.  Right?  In the text when I'm doing it on stage.  He lost 300 pounds eating subs.  I go, what was he eating before?  Now, can you tell that he's making it?  He wrote this down.  I don't want to stop people from eating.  Rich Voss has made that up yesterday.  He wrote it down.  He's trying it here. 
[01:10:30]  No, I'm not.  What he's going to end up doing is.  Basically, hey, everybody.  Why should I go white?  Woss!  Woss!  Woss!  It's a new joke.  Why should I go black?  You never go back home.  Woss!  Woss!  Woss!  It's new!  It's a new joke.  Buy my CD.  Woss!  You're doing it.  Buy some. 
[01:11:00]  Buy some.  Buy some.  Is Jared even doing those commercials anymore?  Yeah, they show up.  I haven't seen them.  I've got to.  Listen.  Rich Voss always comes out with new stuff all the time.  Uh-huh.  Hey, now, Mary.  Did you see me the other night perform?  Oh, they set her up.  Yeah?  No, we haven't watched it.  You were wonderful.  Well, how funny was I?  You were very funny, and he got me dinner, too.  Uh-oh.  See that?  He didn't pay for it, but he got it for me.  Yeah, I hooked you up, right?  Yes.  With a salad?  Yes, you did.  All right, we're done with you. 
[01:11:30]  What do you think of our new furniture outside the studio?  That's nice.  We're jazzing up the place.  What's that?  The vinyl or whatever sort of spoo slides off it?  What is that crap out there?  I don't know.  It's like the furniture that they brought in.  It looks like Greg Brady's attic bedroom now.  It's groovy.  Don't you feel like you're on the real world set or something?  No, I wouldn't put that in a summer beach house.  It's really ugly.  It really is.  I like the old stained stuff that was in here.  Because you know, at least when I talk, I'm going to slobber, and I'm not going to feel guilty.  That stuff is horrible. 
[01:12:00]  Who picked it out?  Patrice is just shaking his head out.  Patrice is like, you're saying nothing.  What?  I'm just talking.  If you see these guys down at Caroline's, Voss will be up there.  He'll be doing his act.  And Patrice is sitting by the kitchen door, kind of pretty far away, just mocking Voss the whole time.  It's awful.  Now he's sitting by the kitchen door waiting for food.  I'm fat, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a fat joke.  I'm fat.  People can't see you on the radio, Voss, but I'm a fat guy. 
[01:12:30]  You are a buffet molester.  You're not fat.  Jesus Christ.  You're fat.  Stop insulting me.  Will you get it?  It's the year 2006, Rich.  His jokes are old.  His car is old.  Did it?  Yeah, I heard about this car.  I drove this car.  He's making payments on an 89...  Wait, but here's the thing.  You're making payments?  He's got the janitors, like the rich janitor, Benz. 
[01:13:00]  It's not even like, it's the Benz they make for people that just, but that's Voss.  You ever see him?  Voss, your shirt's dirty.  It's DKNY.  Voss, but it's filthy.  I can't even fight that.  But it's DKNY.  Voss, this car stinks.  It's 1982.  It's 1982.  You're trash machines.  It's your machines.  You're paying for this? 
[01:13:30]  You're making payments?  Yeah.  Did he tell you he's making payments?  Wait, wait.  Did I tell you what the number was?  Did I tell you what the number was?  No, what is it?  One-ninety-e.  It's a one-ninety-e.  Look, it's a clean-looking Mercedes.  It's a one...  Nobody has a one-ninety-e.  I never even heard of that.  You're a big black man.  You're driving a Cadillac.  I'm supposed to.  You're a junior driving a Mercedes.  That's only because...  That's only because you...  That's only because you...  That's only because you...  That's only because you didn't get it.  Driving a Nazi car, not even a good one. 
[01:14:00]  You're driving a bad Nazi car.  You suck.  Oh, man.  Here's what Rich...  This is what he thought.  This is what he thought when he came up here.  Just real quick.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to hog this.  No, hell no.  This is what he thought.  Yeah.  He says...  Enough with a slobber.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Some people distinguish.  He's talking about you instead of just talking.  This is what he thought.  He thought, hey, I'm...  Because him and Norton, for some reason, they think they're goodfellas now.  For some reason. 
[01:14:30]  They want to pay for meals now.  They point at you when they talk.  Hey, hey.  Everybody's Italian, even at Chinese restaurants.  Hey.  Oh, hey, there.  Hi, there.  And this is what he thought.  He thinks he's a made man.  He's going to bring me up an Opie and Anthony show and make a complete jag-ass out of me.  Because he's a regular guest.  He's going to call that, everybody.  Hey, Patrice, this is a pinball machine that's broke.  Hey, secretariat.  Hey, everybody.  Like, he's bringing me through the back entrance and the goodfellas like...  He thinks he's Ray Liotta now. 
[01:15:00]  He sucks.  He's using you just to get airtime.  You know that, right?  That's what he does.  That's what he does.  We would never have him up.  Did he tell you he is a regular guest?  The regular guest, though, that everyone goofs on.  He stinks.  This is what he thought.  He said, okay, I'm going to bring on some new guy.  But you didn't realize they can't see fat over the radio, though.  But they can hear...  Voss, you notice how you were whisked right into the studio as soon as you got here?  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  I didn't get to think about it.  Oh, okay.  No, I can't listen to kids.  Wait, what are you...  Those are from, like, 1950s.  How are those headphones you gave them?  Those headphones are older than your car.  I had to make an executive decision.  I got Colin Hanks and Jack Black.  Oh, so, yeah.  So Voss gets the crappy...  Dude, I can't...  Know what those headphones look like?  What was the old game show where they...  Tattletales.  Tattletales.  You got the Tattletales.  Headphones on.  Either that or...  Dude, I can't even take you serious until you put real headphones on. 
[01:16:00]  It's either that or it looks like the Michael Dukakis presidential campaign commercials where he was in the tank with the big helmet on.  Or it looks like 1972 elementary school hearing test.  No, we love Voss.  And you said it when you walked in.  You're like, whoa, well, there's no one to goof on.  What am I going to do?  You said, what am I going to do?  There's no one to goof on.  Voss kills when he has someone to goof on in this studio.  No, listen, I never fail for you guys.  We're all team players.  I didn't bring up here thinking, hey, I'm going to crack on you. 
[01:16:30]  I don't care about you.  No, I didn't.  What am I going to say possibly about you?  No.  You absolutely did, Voss.  I don't like how you try to use me like I'm the new kid at Reese's.  No.  Not at all.  They call me and say, you know, whatever.  We've been trying to get you on the show for a while.  Yeah.  Listen, if your phone was turned on and they could have called you, then you would have known that.  There you go.  Black people's phones ain't turned on.  No, yours are.  Yours isn't, okay?  See, and whenever I come back to you, you're going to be, oh, the whole black people thing,  you know?  It's you.  You.  It has nothing to do with black people. 
[01:17:00]  Do you like his black humor there, Patrice?  It's, I mean, yeah.  The wallet joke and the fried chicken, the coochie fried.  Every black comic on earth talks about white people.  Not really.  I don't.  Who?  Yes, you do.  You don't talk about white people?  No.  No?  Say one joke.  I can say about ten of them.  Say one.  When I'm walking down the street, some white lady's walking at me and I'm thinking, you know.  That's talking about, that's, that's, that's, that's reflective on me.  You're talking about white people.  What I think.  Right.  I'm not saying white people's phones work, black people's don't. 
[01:17:30]  Well, I'm generalizing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  White people.  White people.  Well, no, you don't do that.  White people talk like, oh, man.  No.  What?  What?  No.  White ladies fall at the monster movie.  That's what I do.  No, you don't do that.  I don't lie.  You don't do that.  Like, white people are crazy.  White people pay taxes.  You don't do that.  I get nervous.  White people support their kids.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  Well, I don't remember what I do because I'm moving on to new material.  They get up early for work, white people.  They crazy.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  White people, they crazy.  They see their kids once or twice a year. 
[01:18:00]  No, see, you do the regular stuff about white people.  White people crazy.  That's not me.  They got bank accounts.  Now he's making up stuff.  White people crazy.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's not on his CD.  They like girls with small asses.  All this stuff is not on his CD.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Stop using me as a black guinea pig.  I don't like that.  I'm not.  I'm just saying, you talk about white people.  Say one of my jokes.  I try not to remember your act. 
[01:18:30]  Say one of my jokes.  Listen, you do the one about if a white lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's white.  That's very funny.  How about if a lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it.  Why has it got to be a white lady?  Of course, if a white lady is killed in real life, you're going to look at black people.  It's funny when I say white lady, Voss.  But it's funny when I say black people.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It is.  They feel bad for you, Rich.  No.  Okay.  Oh, God. 
[01:19:00]  Wait.  Wait.  When we're doing...  Okay.  Here's the deal.  22 years in the business.  Listen to me.  A room full of all black...  A room full of all black comics.  Yeah.  I mean, all black audience.  Yeah.  Right?  You're on stage, Armand.  Who's going to do better?  Me!  Yeah?  Let's get your old Apollo tape.  Let's get your Apollo tape.  I got booed once.  You got booed 17 times, and you think black people love you.  No.  They hate you like white people, like Jews.  No one likes you.  What happened at the Apollo?  I got booed right off.  How did that happen?  You got booed at the Apollo? 
[01:19:30]  I came out there nice and arrogant.  You know what?  I didn't come out there.  What's up?  What's up?  I went out there.  Yo.  Yeah, Apollo.  I expected the same reaction I'd get at Caroline's.  Nothing.  You know what you got to come out for the Apollo?  You come out in an Asian guy mask, and they will love you.  I have seen, I've watched every goddamn episode of Showtime at the Apollo, and they love,  when the Asian, like, they could do 80s breakdancing.  They could do 80s breakdancing.  They got like, and we got this Japanese troupe over there that don't speak a word of English. 
[01:20:00]  They go, oh, oh.  And the music starts.  The whole crowd goes, wah!  They go crazy.  And if they sing gospel, that's even heaven.  Oh, yeah.  A Chinese guy singing gospel on the Apollo.  Oh, yeah.  Forget it.  He's 20 weeks in a row.  He's winning.  I got booed right off.  Really?  Too arrogant, you think?  Yeah, I came out nice and like I was funny.  Yeah.  I got a big, fat lesson.  They're not going to show it, though, because I curse.  I made sure I swear.  You got it on my hand.  You never made it.  You should show this. 
[01:20:30]  That's smart.  Yeah, they're just smart.  Hey, Lisa from Cleveland has a problem today.  Lisa, what's up?  Hey, Lisa, you still there?  Ah, where'd she go?  Oh, bummer.  It says, on her period, but wants sex, even just oral, boyfriend, what to do, what to do.  Lisa, we lose you?  Hello?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm all right.  My name's not Lisa.  It's Elizabeth.  Well, whatever.  Oh, okay.  So now you're having your time.  Is that okay?  And your boyfriend doesn't touch you when you're doing this? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I don't know what his time is.  He doesn't want to get freaky or anything.  You know, it's like, I'm on my rag, and I've been on my rag for months.  See, I started taking my birth control, Joe.  Maybe it's the way you put it.  No.  Okay, look.  Well, hey.  I'm on my rag.  For months, maybe you're a gay bag, same thing.  Okay, I just started taking my birth control, Joe.  Right.  Hold on.  You're on the rag for months at a time?  Yeah.  Well, no, listen.  This is the thing.  When you start taking birth control, when you first start taking it, you're on your rag  for like a month.  Okay.  And see, I haven't had any sex because he doesn't want to do anything, and it's pissing me off. 
[01:21:30]  He doesn't want to do anything.  And I'm a freak like that, and I like to...  So, he's not into the crime scene sex.  Crime scene sex is perfectly acceptable.  Just do it on...  You guys into the crime scene sex?  Darker sheets.  No, no.  You don't do that?  No?  I don't mind committing a crime against sex, but I'm...  You won't...  I make my girl sleep on the floor, and she's on a period.  Really?  What?  I don't even touch her.  Nasty.  Yeah.  You should be willing to touch her no matter what that your girl...  Okay, I'm not happening to do something every night. 
[01:22:00]  A month of bleeding from that mess.  I don't even know if that made the error.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  God damn.  Yeah, I don't...  You know something?  I got no problem.  The guy should have...  He should dive right in there.  Yeah, there's no gray area with that one, man.  You should throw it.  You're either into it or not.  Yeah.  What I'm saying?  What should I say to him?  Say F me, or I'll find someone that will.  I don't get him, Colin.  It's not blood.  I can't do that.  I've been with this guy for like two years.  It's all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, it's eggs and... 
[01:22:30]  It's like a puree.  And it's cleansing.  If he was just bleeding like it was a wound, it would be different.  Yeah, but I'm saying, see, and I'm almost off, and it's not even all that bad anymore.  So wait a day or two.  It's like, it's almost done, and he still won't do anything.  It's been like two weeks since he's touched me, and it's like...  Maybe he just doesn't want to have sex.  What's that language?  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah, I don't need it.  Long, long blonde hair.  Yeah, how do you look?  Yeah? 
[01:23:00]  What else do you want to know?  On a one to ten, what are you?  Huh?  On a one to ten scale, what are you?  And you've got to be an eight.  On a personal opinion?  Yeah.  No, from the guy down the block.  Yeah, a personal opinion.  I'll give myself an eight.  I'll be in Cleveland next week.  Well, if it's, if it's, uh, like Patrice said, if, if it's looked like a regular wound blood,  if it's like, uh, what, like ragu marinara, you don't want to, no, nothing even near there. 
[01:23:30]  It was that bad.  I wouldn't actually do anything.  It looks like cacciatore.  Chunks of peppers and onions.  A lot of fun stuff also.  Sure.  Sure.  It looks like salsa.  Well, maybe he's got a point now that I think about it.  All right, Elizabeth, I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  We can't help you today.  You're either, you're either into it or not.  All right.  Thanks anyway, you guys.  All right. 
[01:24:00]  We should take a break because Jack Black is here and Colin Hanks.  What's wrong, Ed?  You want me to go somewhere?  No, I was just, you know, Big Al, you no get period for a month.  She's dying.  She's making a quick diagnosis.  She's dying.  She's dying.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I was wondering, how the hell can you be a tall midget?  How could you be a jumbo shrimp?  A tall midget is good.  Well, a girl called up and she said she was a midget.  What is she supposed to do? 
[01:24:30]  But she's four foot six.  She's four foot six?  Yes.  And there's definitely, if you have the midget look, even though you're four six, you know,  the stuck out ass thing.  Yeah.  The little short stubby arms and the Vienna sausage fingers on the hamburger bun palm.  You work for a carnival?  Yeah.  I don't think height wise really defines midget.  Okay.  We'll see when she comes in.  We'll see, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, boss.  What's up?  And the words from Jim Norton, you stink.  Thank you. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  Thanks.  So we got Patrice and Rich Voss here.  Jack Black waiting outside the studio with Colin Hanks.  Yeah.  Orange County opens everywhere tonight or today, whatever.  And here's Jack Black with Tenacious D.  Oh, really?  Maybe a little advice for the girl in Cleveland.  I don't know.  All right.  Check it out.  This is a song.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[01:25:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  And E.W.  Here, checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  The offspring from Orange County soundtrack, Anthony.  Yes.  Defy you.  Nice little way to fit things together there.  It'll be great.  A little segue in there.  Come on.  We got Jack Black in the studio with Colin Hanks.  I'm being distracted.  Patrice is looking at it like a magazine with some hotties in it.  There's so many of these magazines out now, like Stuff and Maxim and all those that just 
[01:26:00]  have semi-nude girls.  Yeah.  You could get the hardest core pornography everywhere now.  But for some reason, it's so hot to just go back to the basics and see these girls not  really showing everything, but just enough.  I got a question, though.  I got a question, though.  When we flew out here, I bought one of those stuffed ones with the King of Queens.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Leah Remini.  Yeah.  And I'm flipping through it on the plane, and there was this sort of really cute girl  who was sitting the seat over. 
[01:26:30]  And I think she was giving me the bad vibe thing.  And I'm like, why are you flipping through that in a public place?  Then all of a sudden, I felt like I was reading the dirtiest porn mag ever.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do get that look just from...  And it's a perfectly fine magazine on public.  It's not like you would spanking it to swank.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Tell her to mind her business.  I know.  And be grateful that you're not trying to light your shoe on fire.  Exactly.  You know?  That's the least reason I'm playing.  Right. 
[01:27:00]  My God, pornography.  Oh, my goodness.  It's better with her clothes on, because then you can fantasize about ripping them off.  Right?  Very good, Voss.  You don't think so?  That's good.  Is that another black joke you were just making?  Does everyone know everyone in the studio?  That's Rich Voss and Patrice.  Yeah, we were just chatting.  Black, black, Colin Hex.  You've got a grip of people in here.  Any relation?  Yeah.  Any relation?  Any relation.  Look at the guy.  He sounds...  Last night, I was watching Conan.  I don't see it.  And you did something at one point. 
[01:27:30]  I guess people tell you all the time, your eyes especially.  Yeah.  Look like your pops.  Yeah, I know.  And it was like...  My girlfriend goes, oh, my God.  I was like, yeah, it's like Mini Hanks or something, you know?  Well...  The smaller version.  Hey, if you've got to look like somebody, Tom Hanks ain't back.  Look at him with the smug.  Yeah, I'm Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Like you're special without him.  What?  You see his face?  No.  You know, Harry, we ought to kidnap him.  How much is his father worth?  Playing games with this guy.  He's blinking slow.  Everybody's a made man.  Man, my dad is in every blockbuster ever made. 
[01:28:00]  Whatever.  What am I going to say?  Exactly.  Lock the door.  You're not going anywhere, Colin.  To here, it's just his pop, man.  You know.  It's dad.  Shut up, ass kissy.  Here come boss.  Here come boss.  Are you seeing anybody?  Boss, you can't act me.  Try to get in this movie.  Go ahead.  Can I send you a head shot?  You have to follow my CV.  You can tell him boss is the front of many jokes around here.  Definitely. 
[01:28:30]  He's always down at Caroline's.  You can check him out and judge for yourself.  He drives for Mercedes, though.  Yeah, I know.  It'll be parked outside of Rascal's in West Orange tonight.  Oh, Jesus.  What a horrid plug that is.  Well, we're going to be busy going to see Orange County.  Yeah.  We can do both.  Jack Black seems really bored.  No.  You just try to take it all in.  I'm overwhelmed.  Yeah.  We're not really getting the jokes here.  Yeah.  A lot of inside jokes.  I'll be laughing.  That's terrible.  I'll be laughing later.  And you've got a lot of people up in here, too. 
[01:29:00]  I know.  Well, bring on the midget.  Well, because we usually don't have famous people in here.  I know.  That's what it is.  It's a little overwhelming.  That's all right.  Usually we have Rich Voss with these bad jokes.  Yeah.  They were playing foosball, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But Jack has a problem with Colin's technique.  No, dude.  No.  I was doing it, too.  I actually spin.  Yeah, spin.  I wanted to do the spinning technique.  Oh, I can't.  You know.  Is that, like, girlish?  If it wasn't so well lubed, it would not be such a big deal.  We're spraying it down. 
[01:29:30]  We've just got to spray it down with the pledge.  The pledge.  You know what?  It's just like the smell of pledge.  That was my last spinning game.  From now on, I'm going full man style.  Control.  No spin allowed.  Right.  No spin.  Like this.  Some people have, like, the half spin rule.  You're allowed to spin at one revolution, but then you've got to stop.  That's hard to enforce.  College rule.  Because I could easily spin two times.  No, it only spawned once.  You'd never see it.  Exactly.  We have instant replay around here, though, in slow-mo, so we know when you go too far  with the spin moves.  Is it like an Olympic sport?  Do they, like, do it in college? 
[01:30:00]  I don't think it's the Olympics.  In college, it's huge, though.  Yeah.  Huge game.  I was explaining that to you.  They do the three-back goalie thing.  Right.  No, man.  That's like...  We don't like that.  No, that's stupid.  Sacrilege.  I don't like it.  That's stupid.  And then Colin goes, you know, they're checking out the furniture out there that our boss bought  from Ikea.  He goes, dude, I got the same laughs.  Do you?  Ten bucks, man.  Super cheap.  You know, I bought...  I bought him when I was in college.  The guy's counting his money.  I bought him when I was in college.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  It was cheap furniture.  I needed cheap furniture.  You did?  Yeah.  Somehow I can't imagine that.  I'm sure...  You know, I don't know.  I always just think a phone call away, like, hey, you...  It looks like he's doing his own thing, though.  Some of that big money's got to still be...  No, dude, I didn't get...  You didn't get anything, right?  No, I would pray for Wednesdays, because there's 29-cent hamburgers at McDonald's.  Holy jeez.  Why is that?  Is this a conscious decision you made?  No, it's a conscious decision he made, because if he spoils me, then I'm going to be living 
[01:31:00]  off him for the rest of my life.  Right.  He doesn't want that.  That's one of those tough love things.  You know?  That's like...  In my opinion, I think it's good parenting.  Yeah?  You don't want to spoil your kids, too.  All right.  I would have liked a little spoiling myself.  I would have liked it, too, but...  29-cent hamburgers and spoiling.  There's a big gap there somewhere.  What's wrong with Ikea?  You like the fancy Italian stuff?  No, it's just Ikea's good stuff, but...  Look at us.  Does it look like that?  I know it's going to get broken. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  It's not...  That's what I've heard.  The most durable of equipment.  Who decided in Orange County to have you in your underwear 90% of the movie?  You know, I guess it was partially my fault.  Was it?  I felt like I just wanted to wear the funniest thing at all times, and it was usually just  tighty-whities.  What's funnier than tighty-whities?  Is that it?  It just seemed right.  So as a goof, it wasn't like you're feeling good about your body or anything?  No. 
[01:32:00]  No?  In fact, as soon as they said cut, the robe was on.  Really?  Like a heartbeat.  Yeah.  Feeling a little shaky about that?  Yeah.  I would do like a last-second push-ups and sit-ups right before each take.  That was futile.  Pump up a little bit.  Well, I heard that's what Stallone did.  But he would like get an injection.  Over 20 years of working out.  I heard he would like get like a...  What do you call that?  Beefs up your muscles when you get an injection of it?  Steroids?  That thing.  Wow.  Steroids.  I didn't quite know that far.  Get all veiny.  So what's Orange County about? 
[01:32:30]  Cro-Magnon.  We should get the basics out.  What's the movie about?  It's about one boy's journey into manhood.  You guys are like brothers in the movie, kind of, right?  Yes.  Not kind of.  We're actually play brothers, believe it or not.  He gets rejected from college.  Yeah.  Colin.  And then he gets helped out by Jack.  That's right.  He gets rejected.  He wants to get to Stanford.  Right.  And you tell him the rest, dude.  I've said enough.  I want to get the hell out of Orange County.  Yeah.  And your brother's a pothead.  I know that.  Yeah.  And his family's totally insane.  My family's totally insane.  So I apply to Stanford after being told not to apply anywhere else because I'll get in. 
[01:33:00]  My college counselor sends out the wrong transcript.  And then I come to save the day.  Yes.  But I totally screw it up even worse and end up burning down the school by accident.  Of course.  I'm his stoner older brother.  Yeah.  And hilarity ensues.  I saw the Lily Tomlin clip.  You act like a great knee to the nuts.  Yeah, man.  That was very, very well done.  It actually looked like she had kicked you in the nuts.  I think I'm the only person on film that's ever been kneeed in the nuts by Lily Tomlin. 
[01:33:30]  You played it well.  I thought you were saying he needed some nuts.  No.  What?  No.  He took a knee to the nuts.  Did you see the Murphy Jack?  I did see it.  I was confused.  See, at one point.  Ah, forget it.  Yeah.  There's a couple quick questions coming in.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's going on, man?  I just wanted to know if Jack Black was invited to Club Stinky yet.  No.  Club Stinky is the stairwell.  It's the stairwell.  You know Stinky?  Have you met Stinky?  He's outside Man of the Phones.  I don't know.  We invited you the last time you were here. 
[01:34:00]  Did I go there?  I think you passed.  What is it?  I don't think you signed the wall or anything.  Club Stinky is the stairwell where everyone goes, where Stinky takes all the biggest celebrities  to go smoke hot.  Oh, really?  Let's not even brush over anything here.  He's rubbing his hands.  Rodney was there.  Jack Black has to go there.  I haven't been there.  Rodney Dangerfield?  Everyone's been.  Once you get the official invite, once Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice went there.  Vanilla Ice?  Vanilla Ice himself.  Vanilla Ice.  Oh, dude.  I am so mad, man.  Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  I know. 
[01:34:30]  Imagine just being in the same place he was.  Do you have like the mean Vermont chronic?  Because we were on tour.  He's talking to you.  Grab that much.  The Chrisnopolis Chrisnop.  I don't know.  They used to say Humboldt County had the most, you know, potent green.  But then, I don't know.  I went to Vermont and I got to say, oh, yo, yo, yo, yo.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever been overseas to something like Amsterdam?  Yeah.  Because I heard like that's crazy stuff.  Colin, you been there?  I don't think so.  You went to Amsterdam?  Yeah.  I went to three different cities in Holland. 
[01:35:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, Amsterdam is like crazy, but like if you go to like the more mellow, low-key cities,  it's actually a lot better.  I've heard it's all about the hashish over there.  That actually, that's the whole deal over there.  Yeah.  The hashish bar.  It's all about the spleef.  The spleef.  I've always wanted to go there.  Yeah.  I heard it's actually kind of like pretty.  Voss is big.  Yeah.  I heard it's nice.  You went to Amsterdam.  I was looking for a better word.  Voss do a show in Amsterdam.  And the chicks behind the glass and you kind of pick up a sex show in Amsterdam. 
[01:35:30]  Sex shows?  No.  You make your own.  You didn't do one?  22 American.  22 American.  22.  You say 22 American to bang a 10.  A 9 or a 10.  9 or a 10.  I didn't do it, but I heard.  Yes, sure.  A 10.  I'm telling you.  You've seen these girls.  You've been to Amsterdam.  How hot are the girls in Amsterdam?  Did you wake up in a bathtub full of ice with your kidney missing?  And a note saying, get to the hospital?  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Jack, did you ever bang Gwyneth Paltrow, man? 
[01:36:00]  Sort of.  Really?  In my mind.  We went all the way, but only in my mind.  You never banged that man?  No, dude.  You banged the fat version.  Did I let you down?  What?  You got to be so nasty.  Sorry, sorry.  I don't know.  You spanked that fantasy?  That's what gets you off?  Spank is a great fantasy when a fat huge bag like Jack Black can be in movies.  He sure got you.  All right, guys.  I'm going to go run voice.  Whatever.  He sure got you.  He's spanking it to your ass, Jack. 
[01:36:30]  He's just jealous.  Of course.  Jesus, guys.  What about Tenacious D?  When are you guys getting back together?  We are together.  We're playing at Roseland on the 22nd.  Are you?  Yeah.  I just figured now movies and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of like, you know, I'm sure he's getting a little nervous there.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Yeah.  He's keeping busy.  We've got to ask Jack about his mom.  Oh, yeah.  We heard Letterman last night.  She helped with the Hubble Space Telescope. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, she worked on that.  Both my parents were satellite engineers.  I don't know what the hell happened.  I didn't get the smarts.  Goddamn.  That's like, poof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you want to know about it?  I don't know.  I just thought it was kind of an interesting thing that your mom was a...  A top scientist.  Yeah.  Scientist.  And then, like, you get Jack Black as your kid like that.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah.  You could see a fly in Japan with a Hubble telescope.  That's fascinating, boss.  Yeah?  I don't think they... 
[01:37:30]  They don't point it at the Earth, though.  It's all about looking at the Hubble.  Exactly.  That's how powerful it is.  I'm just saying.  Why would it be?  Of course not.  I was just telling you, you know, I have a little bit of knowledge when it comes to the Hubble.  And you know what?  You know what's funny, though?  He says stupid stuff with so much passion and confidence.  Yeah.  And we all knew, as soon as he opened his mouth, everybody would go, what?  Who cares?  I love how you got them sharing the mic.  Yeah, I know.  That's a great photo.  It's very rock and roll.  Yeah.  We can have it, because we...  You have most of the mic, Rich, because you're going to say so much more interesting and 
[01:38:00]  intelligent stuff.  Radio's version of the defiant ones.  You know, toilet water goes backwards in Europe.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey.  Yo, Jack.  What's up?  Yo, dude, bro.  Yeah?  I was watching you since Airborne, man.  Yeah?  When you were the goalie in Airborne.  But let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  What the hell happened?  And I still know what you did last summer.  What about it? 
[01:38:30]  You, uh...  I don't know.  That roll was kind of...  You thought it was bad.  What?  What was bad?  The movie was good?  The roll.  Oh, the roll.  Yeah.  The white Rastafarian?  The white Rastafarian.  Uh, yeah.  Why was it bad?  I don't know, man.  It didn't have to be in the movie.  I didn't see the point of it.  The bad acting?  No, it was great acting.  I didn't watch the movie, man.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  So what was the problem with it, then?  I don't know.  Guy doesn't have a point, Opie.  Yeah.  I couldn't always be so picky and choosy, you know. 
[01:39:00]  It's the things you've got to take what comes.  I think you're doing some really good stuff, man.  Thanks, dude.  I'm a big fan of Tenacious D, too, bro.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  I liked Mars Attacks.  I liked you and that.  Yeah, I was in that.  That was cool.  You got killed by the alien guy.  One of the first guys.  Going with the flag.  That's true.  Colin, any other movies?  What have you done before this?  Any other movies?  There are a lot of really bad teen movies.  Teen movies?  Yeah.  Which ones?  Remember that one with Cisco that came out like a year ago?  Cisco.  Yeah.  What was the name of that again? 
[01:39:30]  Get Over It.  You were in Get Over It?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  I didn't know.  The Cisco movie.  This is like the first starring role, though, right?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Look at Voss.  I would kill to be in a Cisco movie.  Where's Cisco?  He always thinks.  Why didn't he ask me?  I almost got your voice down, too.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Big fans of everyone but Voss, and you don't know the struggle, brother.  I'm listening to you.  Thank you.  Hey, Jack, I got a question for you.  You were on A Millionaire recently.  Yeah, man. 
[01:40:00]  I did pretty good.  Yeah, you were awesome.  That's the only reason I watched.  But, man, it looked like you were pissing someone off there, were you?  What?  Who pissing who off?  That dude?  I looked like Regis was getting a little bit pissed off.  Your appearance on A Millionaire was great.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, I don't think you really knew what angle to take with me.  He couldn't tell if you were joking.  I don't get this guy.  I don't know if he's joking with me or something.  I think he was looking for an angle to point out how stupid I was, but then I just kept  on winning all the damn money.  Never be a kid that, Jack.  You're awesome the way you are.  Later, boys. 
[01:40:30]  Thank you.  It sucks.  All right, bye.  Oh, man.  I love you.  You had to get a little dig in at the end there.  That's quick.  Yeah.  See?  Now, the sucks thing on this show, it's like Primus.  Oh, right.  Primus sucks.  It's a compliment.  Yeah.  Unless they're talking about Regis.  Oh, that's what we tell ourselves.  It does revert back to its definition.  That's what we tell ourselves.  I got you.  Yeah, that's what we tell ourselves.  No, that means we rule.  No, really.  That means we're like the greatest in stuff.  We know.  Where's the midget girl?  You want to bring her in real quick?  You guys want to see this midget girl?  Yes.  Sure.  She called up yesterday.  What was her story? 
[01:41:00]  She said she's got a website that she wants to plug, and she does things with dildos and  whatnot, and she wanted to...  Is she going to put on a show?  I don't know.  All right.  That's why we automatically just say, come down.  But she's like a tall midget.  That's right.  You are a tall midget.  You're a tall midget.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  Look at you.  Yeah, I don't think he called me.  Do you have heels on?  Wow.  Wow.  You look like Tara Lipinski.  Tara Lipinski?  No, I just...  I found her quite a chanting.  Hi, I'm Jack.  Isn't that something?  What's your name?  Nicole Star. 
[01:41:30]  Nicole, you know Jack?  Wait, Nicole Star like home?  Dot com.  Oh, Nicole Star dot com.  Oh, that's her name.  She says the website.  Nicole, get over here with these two guys.  Ask Corridor.  How you doing?  Nice.  Why, she has short little arms, so she is...  Is she commenting on limbs or nothing?  Wait, see what happened?  Nicole?  Now you guys are sharing them.  She's so nice to look at them.  Well, talk.  You're on the radio.  Is she going to do something like, you know...  I don't know.  Take the coat off a little.  Let's get a look at you. 
[01:42:00]  Because I haven't seen this since...  Yeah.  She's more little girl than midget.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, this is...  Does that make you hot, Patrice?  No.  But she reminds me of my daughter.  And I owe her money, so I'm dodging her.  Oh, my God.  All right, Nicole.  4'6".  You know Hank?  The angry dog?  Yeah, you said that yesterday.  Yeah.  The dead guy.  I know him.  He...  Well, you don't know him anymore.  He's doing a lot to do, to make up a website, so... 
[01:42:30]  What, like a...  Oh, really?  He kind of got you into doing a website?  Yeah.  Is she Spanish?  She's Spanish, right?  You're...  Italian.  Italian.  Lips.  You like that?  Is it like a sexy website?  Yeah.  Is that the deal?  It's a nude porn show.  Oh, really?  It's a nude porn...  How many hits you get on that thing?  I have a couple.  Is it a couple?  A couple hits.  Good.  You're in business.  There's like a picture.  Uh-huh.  And then there's a part that you pay for it.  How do you make...  Oh, I see.  You got to pay for the good stuff.  Yeah, I do. 
[01:43:00]  That'd be like, if you had to do a midget, this is the midget you'd pick.  That's right.  You're a hot little midget.  I gotta say.  She is.  She really is cute, man.  Can we see her naked?  Like that Total Recall midget.  Is she going to get naked?  Right?  You know, in Total Recall?  That's what happened on this show.  That boost the A.  That boost the A.  Please do.  You want to see this?  I will blast off tonight to a midget.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Raw dog to a midget.  Raw dog to a midget, man.  That's right.  That's good.  Do you do anything like stripping or is it strictly the website? 
[01:43:30]  And how did you decide if you wanted to get into a website to make it a porno site?  It's me.  No, this question's for Jack Black.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm at you.  Was it?  I'm at you.  Now Patrice is just like, I want to see it.  I know you guys got to do your job.  I want to see a naked midget.  I swear to you, I want to see it.  You really want to see a naked midget.  I really want to see it.  I don't know how much money I got.  I want to see it. 
[01:44:00]  Would you be willing to disrobe for Patrice here?  We will plug your website.  You will get probably...  And if there's ever a time, he doesn't want that out.  If you dance, Patrice will put wick checks in your drawers.  Hi-ho, folks.  Come on here, folks.  Black people are wearing...  So do you do anything like that?  Do you do any public exhibitions of nudity? 
[01:44:30]  No, I have parties.  You have parties?  Yeah.  What happens at parties?  What is that?  It's like me and a lot of girls.  Yeah?  I don't really be with...  I'm not with too many guys.  Right.  So you like the girls.  I don't like about...  You were saying yesterday, you get like dildos and whatnot.  Yeah.  Have some fun.  That's what it's all about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is she being forced to do this?  Yeah.  Are you...  She's a little nervous.  Midget slavery ring. 
[01:45:00]  Are you a little nervous?  No.  Yeah, listen up.  Did you mean she's little and nervous or a little nervous?  I didn't quite get exactly what you said.  Is she really nervous?  But I know.  It's like they have a loved one in a box buried on the ground.  And if she doesn't do this, they die.  Well, let's see something.  You like that, huh?  Yeah.  That's good.  Jack, would you like to see this?  I don't know.  Not if she doesn't want to.  Right.  Exactly.  See? 
[01:45:30]  She seems pretty tired.  Are you like...  Did you like just wake up or...  No.  You had...  She had a little nap.  Did you crack a few before you came over?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  Ah, see.  There you go.  She seems a little shy to me.  She seems shy.  A little shy again.  She seems like a nice girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think she only really gets into it when she knows the webcam is on.  Ah, that might be it.  Do you have something like...  Not our webcam.  Her webcam.  Do you have a webcam on your site?  Uh, no. 
[01:46:00]  No?  She must be a little uncomfortable.  It's like a sausage fest in here.  I know.  Yeah.  I know.  There's nothing really much we can do about that, but...  No, I think she's ready to take off her clothes.  Do you know what Whip Him Out Wednesday is?  You ever hear that?  Yes.  She needs some encouragement.  It's when you whip him out.  Like, you ever flash to anybody or something like that?  Because Patrice is chomping at the bit here.  I really want to see this.  I have to see this.  He's dying.  I really have to see this.  I have to see this.  To see the nude form of a midget girl.  Push her over the top, man. 
[01:46:30]  What?  Push her over the top?  Meaning, meaning, she'll do it.  Well, I mean, whatever you're comfortable with.  Yeah.  Maybe just a little butt crack.  Yes.  That's what I'm talking about.  Be shallow, baby.  Be shallow.  You're naked on this website?  Yeah.  Oh.  So, then, would you have a problem with maybe showing your nude form to the gentleman?  Maybe we should all get naked.  And that'll make her more comfortable.  What would you like to do?  Nobody wants to do that.  We would actually like to see you completely naked, yeah.  Yeah.  If that's, you know, acceptable.  And Jack Black will get down to his tighty-whities like he does in Orange County. 
[01:47:00]  That's as far as I go, though, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you say?  I don't go to Full Monty.  That's good.  Well, plug your website.  Your butt crack was on TV on the bicycle when you were riding it down one of the streets  of Manhattan.  They fuzzed it out, though, a little bit.  Yeah.  There were people snapping pictures all in the side of the road.  They were like, dude, I got Jack Black's ass.  I know.  A lot of people have my ass.  That's the last time I show my ass.  Yeah?  Nicole Starr.  All right.  For no money.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  Yeah.  What's her name?  What's your name? 
[01:47:30]  Nicole Starr.  Nicole.  Nicole Starr.  Right.  How old a girl are you?  18.  You're 18?  Oh, my God.  Hey, there you go.  Teen midget.  That makes you 16.  Teen midget.  She looks older, too.  Naked teen midget.  That's a backhanded compliment.  Well, I mean, like, sexy older, you know.  Oh, you like that?  She looks older?  Because 18 isn't sexy, boss?  You think she's on the back of my head?  Yeah, look at him.  He's in a ditch.  He meant older, like.  I said we get it home.  He's 29.  Let's get it home.  Yeah, everyone's going really crazy. 
[01:48:00]  Okay.  A lot of people say I look like Bridget the Midget.  Bridget the Midget.  Sure.  Well, you're her height.  And you're a midget.  You want us to dim the lights a little?  Maybe some music?  You want to get up on the table?  Yeah, get her up on the table.  Patrice, lift her up.  Lift her up on the table.  Come on.  Here come Daddy.  Lift her up on the table.  Colin, you'll never forget us.  Trust me.  Come on.  This will be great. 
[01:48:30]  Nicole, what do you say?  Let me see what she's wearing.  She's got leather pants on.  You're wearing little platform shoes.  She's got little platform shoes.  Look at that.  All right.  Get her up on the calendar, man.  Wow.  How much taller does that make you?  Four inches?  Take up to here.  Oh, man.  There I go.  She's got the tattoo on her rear.  How do you see that?  I just got a glimpse.  Do you?  What is it of?  Here, turn around.  Let's see that.  Look at that.  What do you think, Patrice?  That's like the rock and roll tattoo.  Crack is a little far down, but I want to see. 
[01:49:00]  It's a little far down.  I thought I was going to see Crack, but then she has the longest back for a midget I've ever  seen, which makes her more sexy.  The tattoo going there.  That looks hot.  Yes.  Steve.  I like that.  Get her up on the counter there.  Lift her up.  Come on, Nicole.  And then make sure she...  There you go.  Steve, pick her up.  There we go.  Wow.  Hey, that's a fine F.  She doesn't fit.  She doesn't fit.  Get the light out of her eyes.  She doesn't fit.  It's like an interrogation.  All right, Nicole.  Let's see what you got.  Nicole, let's see what you got there. 
[01:49:30]  I got you.  Yeah, make sure she doesn't fall.  Yeah, if you want to take your shoes off, you'll be a little shorter.  I'm just here in case you fall.  Yeah.  No, you're there for a lap dance, you idiot.  All right, Nicole.  Well, if you're to just show Patrice what you, you know, show them what you got.  I feel like I'm begging here.  Yeah, go ahead.  I think she's a little slow or something.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  There you go.  That's better.  All right, let's go, Nicole.  There we go. 
[01:50:00]  I mean, she's built like a girl.  Come on, Colin.  You know you want to see this.  Of course she's built like a girl.  Who doesn't?  You know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  If you're going to fall, she's going to the big black suit.  I don't know.  Are you going to have trouble taking the shirt off at the ceiling?  Let's see.  Yeah.  See, that works good.  All right, Nicole.  Whenever you're ready.  Yeah.  If you want to take the shoes off.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll make it easier because, boy, those make you taller.  Those are like eight inches.  My God.  You're quite a lot taller with those shoes on.  She fits now, though. 
[01:50:30]  There they go.  Because before she had to, you know, her head was down.  Look at the size of those feet.  By the way, go see Orange County.  Yes.  That opens tonight, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can go right now.  All right.  She's there.  Now she could stand up on the console without any problem.  She's a lot shorter after she took the shoes off.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, just do your thing.  Let's see what we...  Okay.  You know what?  Let's just see what we'd see on the website.  Sure.  That's it.  You like that. 
[01:51:00]  Patrice is digging this.  There we go.  She's unbuttoning the top.  A little lace number.  A little black lacy number.  Red and bra pants.  There you go.  She's wearing a red bra.  And panties.  That's good.  She's taking that top off.  I think.  Are you taking that top off?  There she goes.  Careful.  No, no.  We'll keep a hold on her.  She won't fall.  She won't fall.  Last thing we need is a dead nude midget on the floor.  Because I don't know how I'd explain that to any of my family.  To Tom Hanks. 
[01:51:30]  How would Colin explain that back home?  This is so like...  How'd your trip go?  Well, dude.  I did this one radio show.  I think you should go check it out, man.  Why are you implicated in the death of a bitch, son?  Dad?  Focus.  It's taking years to hone this image that I have.  And my son's killing midgets.  All right.  What about the leather pants?  Because I'd like to see that. 
[01:52:00]  I see you got the matching panties on under that.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What do you think, Patrice?  I've slept with worse.  Yeah.  You'll like it.  No, how about I help her?  I have slept with worse.  Hey, hey, help her.  I'm telling you.  If you compare it to what I've slept with before, she's a seven.  It's hot.  Hey, hold her up, Steve.  So she can get those pants around there so she doesn't fall.  There you go.  Hold on to me.  Hold on to Steve and then get the rest of those pants back down around. 
[01:52:30]  I have to bet.  You're choreographing the whole thing.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to organize this thing.  No one's taking charge except you.  I'm trying.  Thank you, Colin.  But you want to know what?  It does seem like you're begging.  It does.  But, you know, I'm getting results.  Where the hell else are you going to see that?  You're very result-oriented.  Look at that.  That's, uh...  I mean, what can you really say, man?  I don't know what to say, man.  This is every fantasy I've had about that little fat third grader.  Yes.  I went to school with it.  It's, uh...  That's...  No, that's nice. 
[01:53:00]  That is nice.  We've got to go for more.  And now do you get the, um...  Is it completely nude on the website?  Uh, yeah, but I have, like, different outfits on.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Well, let's see what you're, uh, sporting under that, uh...  Yeah, let's see what the rest of that looks like.  Because I have never seen...  I've got to be honest with you.  I have never seen a completely naked midget girl in my life.  Ever.  This is the first.  And, and...  This is the first.  We've all been around a few, uh, times.  We've been around the block.  And I think we would all love to see a completely nude midget girl.  Am I the only one that's noticed that her socks are kind of dirty? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, she's a mess.  Why are you doing that?  I know what all you guys are staring at, but I'm so fascinated by the dirty socks.  You know, Colin, we can't all have grown up in an atmosphere where your laundry is always clean.  You know, Tom Hanks is putting away your underwear.  It's, you know, we aren't all, uh...  I was looking at his socks, too, but, you know.  See, thank you.  Hey there, Polo.  This is one of the most surreal moments we've had on this show. 
[01:54:00]  Polo or Polio.  All right, Nicole, let's, uh, let's see what else you can do for us here.  If you would go with a full Monty, we'd love it.  You are going to get millions of hits on your website, by the way.  Here comes the, uh, bra.  Oh, God.  We are actually going to see.  Midget push.  Make it midget.  I think Monty, full Monty, like, that means, like, uh, sausage.  Uh, you know something?  Whatever it means.  I know what you're saying.  Right now, I think we're all getting the gist of what it means right now.  What?  Oh, there we go.  Wait, turn around. 
[01:54:30]  Yes.  Turn around, Nicole.  Yes.  Turn it around.  All right, Opie, take a look.  What do you think?  Yeah.  This is so dirty, man.  Come on, that rocks.  You, let me tell you something.  What's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the, what's the website?  www.nicolestar.com.  Nicolestar.com.  You're going to get, your website's going to get pounded tonight.  Now, Nicole, if I can ask, here it is.  The piece de resistance, the last thing, if you could please, as you're facing Patrice, 
[01:55:00]  just like that, take down those hot, sexy red panties.  Let's see.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Jack Black's going to get a face full of midget ass.  Yes.  You're not going to get this on Letterman, Jack.  Here we go.  What?  What's the matter?  Someone's got a spot.  What's the matter?  She's kind of close to the edge.  Oh, why not?  Oh, what happened?  Wait, what happened?  I thought we were going to see.  Wait, what happened?  Nicole?  You don't go naked? 
[01:55:30]  You don't go all naked?  Not all naked, no.  No?  What are the initials on her back?  She's got a tattoo on her back.  She's got some initials.  You got initials?  No, on your back, like your shoulder.  Up here.  T-A-D?  Tad?  Yeah.  What's that?  That was my father's name.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I think I just killed the mood.  Yeah, thanks, Colin.  Jeez.  What happened to your father?  I don't know.  She doesn't go naked.  I was going to say she's half naked on the table. 
[01:56:00]  A naked midget on the table.  Are you going to feel bad?  Was he of average height, your father?  He was tall.  He was tall?  Yeah.  Really?  And your mom, too?  Yeah.  Was she tall?  She was a little shorter than my dad.  Yeah?  And then you're what they call, what, midget?  No, what do they call what you are?  They call me midget.  Is it midget?  Yeah.  What happened to the pop?  What?  What happened to her father?  Hey, easy, chief.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  Ask her.  What happened to your dad? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, he passed away.  Yeah.  With a heart attack.  Oh.  Opie.  Opie.  Turn down.  I still want to see her naked.  Y'all can go on with this.  I know.  I want to see her naked.  We all got problems.  Six of my dogs got hit by a car.  I want to see a little bit of...  I just got to see the whole thing.  I know.  You got to ask her.  She's right in front of you.  It is very...  You know something?  I can't look because she does have a sad face, so I can't be a girl back and look directly 
[01:57:00]  at her.  Nicole, you sad?  It's very sexy.  You get a lot of guys that want to have sex with you and stuff?  Do you?  You get a lot of emails and stuff from guys that want to be with you and stuff?  I don't really...  You're not into guys?  You're into girls, right?  Girls, yeah.  Girls.  Just girls.  You get a lot of girls that want to be with you?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I've been with, like, four.  You have?  You ever have a guy?  You ever been with a man?  No?  Not really.  Really?  Well, that's something.  So you're technically a virgin. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It's a midget virgin.  I didn't really creeps out.  It's right here.  But you won't do away with the panties, huh?  No.  No?  All right.  Well, I'm not going to force any more than I already have.  I think I've broken some laws here.  Morals.  All right.  I don't care about morals.  But you go no panties on the website, though?  Yeah.  Oh, so we can see it on the website.  So why there and not here?  Oh, do you know how many hits you're going to get on that website?  Woo!  There's going to be millions of people seeing you completely naked. 
[01:58:00]  Maybe she's got something going on.  Is there anything we should know about that maybe is a little weird?  No.  No.  You just don't want to pay.  That's the thing.  You know, Colin, you're right.  I don't want to go to the website and have to put on my credit card number.  You know?  All right, Nicole.  Well, Nicole, all right, help her down.  What's wrong with Voss?  Rich got all saddled.  What's the matter, Rich?  Grab the mic.  Does it remind you of some of your jokes about your daughters?  Reminds me of my daughter.  No, there's nothing wrong.  What's the matter? 
[01:58:30]  I'm just upset.  Isn't that cute?  Look at how Steve picked her off and put her down there.  Well, I'm just upset.  That's great.  The bearded lady got naked and she didn't.  Oh, shoot.  I broke the thing.  What?  Jack's microphone just fell down.  Well, we've got to take a break anyway.  That's all right.  Nicole, you all right?  Is that right?  Yeah, you're going to get your website's probably getting pounded right now.  It's NicoleStark.com, the website?  Yes.  Yeah, all our listeners will go there.  Trust me.  Hey, Nicole, can you give us a password?  Can you give us a free password so we can check you out naked? 
[01:59:00]  There isn't a free password.  No?  No.  You've got to pay, huh?  It's just a pick tour, that's it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Pick tour.  Pick tour.  All right.  But you sound depressed.  Are you depressed?  No.  You don't sound very out there.  Did you?  You had a few?  Didn't you?  Yeah.  A few wobbly pops?  It's like one.  That's all it takes.  One, yeah.  That height-weight ratio thing. 
[01:59:30]  Patrice, right?  You want to see that?  Yeah, I don't care about all that stuff.  Do you shave at all?  Do you shave at all?  Yeah.  Completely?  Nicole?  Nicole?  This is my, uh, what?  No, I mean, do you shave?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Completely?  Yeah.  Yes?  Maybe, uh, maybe Nicole can give Patrice just a private little, uh.  Without the cameras.  You know, I'm like a little girl.  I'm not going to do it with all the witnesses in.  I didn't touch the little sad and it made it funny. 
[02:00:00]  It's just sad.  Oh.  Well, we should take a break.  Yes.  It's Nicole.  NicoleStar.com?  NicoleStar.com.  All right.  You guys are here for a while?  Let's go.  Yeah, I'm just for hanging with me.  Yes.  Do you want to go to Club Stinky?  Uh, I should do a visit Club Stinky.  Yeah, you probably should.  It's a fun place.  All right.  There's a little nightclub right here on, uh. 
[02:00:30]  Let's see Orange County.  We've got Jeff Black and Colin Hanks in the studio.  We've got Nicole.  The, uh, tall midget, Anthony.  She's tall.  Are you going to hang out for a little bit there, uh, you fidget?  Yeah?  Cool.  You've got to make her smile, though, or something.  Yeah, you've got to make her happy.  I'm not going to smile.  You've got a girlfriend, a steady girlfriend, or anything?  No.  You want us to hook you up with a girl?  We could get a girl down here, and you guys go crazy on each other.  I'm an Ikea virgin.  You want to do that?  Yeah, you could use the ottoman. 
[02:01:00]  We need the whole couch with you.  All right.  We'll take a break and get back.  Is the virgin here?  Yeah.  Who's she?  He's got more of a grudge.  Wait until we plunge a knife through a heart and sacrifice it to the ratings gods.  We do it every year.  We'll help the box office for, uh, for Orange County.  Orange County, man.  Oh, yeah.  Open tonight.  Check it out.  New York.  Yeah, we're back with the show. 
[02:01:30]  In the studio, Jack Black and Colin Hanks.  Oh, yeah.  Go check out Orange County.  Rich Voss.  And Patrice.  Patrice, man.  In the studio.  And, uh, Nicole.  Do you think people know what you're saying when you say go check out Orange County?  They might think you're saying just go over and check out, like, that city.  Go to Orange County.  Now, the movie.  The movie.  Yeah.  Where you're almost naked the whole time.  Have you seen it yet?  No.  It's funny, man.  It opens today.  I'm going Sunday.  Check it out.  I'm going to go to movies on Sunday. 
[02:02:00]  I know.  I thought you might have, like, hooked up one of those secret premieres or something.  Ah, no.  Don't you get invited to those?  We don't even get those.  And I'm not even kidding.  Like, a lot of people go, oh, we don't get invited to anything.  And then you get invited.  We never, we don't go to any premieres.  The last thing we even went to that was sort of like that was when the Star Wars came out.  The first of the.  Oh, Phantom Menace.  Yeah, Phantom Menace.  And I'm like, oh, this is cool.  Is it a premiere or something?  It's like, no, it's some kind of screening where you've got to get there early before the place fills up. 
[02:02:30]  And I'm like, in the back of the theater, it sucked.  I felt special for like a second.  They give out 10,000 free tickets and the first 300 get in?  Yeah, get in.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like Lotto.  We get those.  That's cool, right?  Have you seen the trailer for the new Star Wars one?  It looks really lame.  It looks like some kind of love story thing.  And I'm like, he's ruining the franchise.  Yeah.  He's destroying that franchise.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  You're holding out for a hero?  I'm holding out, dude.  The Phantom Menace looked like a kid movie. 
[02:03:00]  I didn't like that.  Dude, here's the deal, dude.  Yeah.  It is a kid movie.  All right, well.  That's what you're forgetting, dude.  All these people complained.  Not back in the day.  It was a kid movie.  Dude, we were all kids when we watched it.  I don't care how old you were.  It's a kid's movie.  No, but it captured the imagination of the nation.  But you know something?  Empire?  Come on.  Nice dark movie.  Well, yeah.  And this one?  And then it's followed up with goddamn stuffed animals.  This one's going to be dark, too.  I just want to know.  I hope so.  If Darth Maul's coming back, I'll go check it out.  Yeah.  That's it.  But that's it. 
[02:03:30]  Dude, they got that like Boba Fett looking dude.  That Jango.  Yeah.  He grew a bottom half like a lizard.  Or like there's just another one.  Another Darth Maul.  Dude, it looks sick.  All right.  I just hope he goes a little darker than the...  You will.  We look.  We're in a chariot race now.  There's going to be some toys.  Joe's disappointed in us.  Joe?  Why?  What's the problem, Joe?  I'm just a little upset that you guys didn't make her go all the way.  You bastards.  You sons of bitches. 
[02:04:00]  I knew you'd give us grief about this.  We were getting a bad vibe.  Yeah.  She seemed really depressed.  Dude, if you were in the room, you would have stopped.  Understand why we stopped.  Yes.  I understand all that.  It would have had to be a beating for her to get any more off.  Yeah.  And I wasn't willing to go that distance.  Rick, why don't you go tell Nicole, she's still outside, that Joe's disappointed that  she didn't get completely naked.  I can't go through this again.  I don't want to.  No, no, I will not sit here and go through this again. 
[02:04:30]  What?  Yeah.  I don't want to see her drowning herself in a glass of water.  Your audience expects you, Jake.  That was really bad, man.  Oh, my God.  That was bad, man.  See, now you know.  See, I got an idea now.  See, in the beginning, you guys were like, wait, why aren't we in on the joke?  Now you're in on the joke.  Definitely in on the joke, man.  There you go, man.  Definitely in on the joke.  Patrice doesn't even want to comment it was that bad.  That was, you know what?  No, ask Patrice.  Did you feel the people not laughing?  I know. 
[02:05:00]  It's like you get a feeling out there.  How many people listen and you can feel the people go, huh?  That was as uncomfortable as when Colin brought up the death tattoo on the admitted's bath.  Dude, you know, how was I supposed to know?  I know.  Let me go to Amanda.  Amanda saw Orange County already.  Amanda.  Yes.  What's up?  How you doing?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  You saw Orange County?  Yeah, I did.  I'm actually from Orange County, but I live in Cleveland right now.  Oh, yeah?  It freaking rocked. 
[02:05:30]  It brought back a lot of memories.  Oh, good.  Yes.  There you go.  Thank you.  It's funny.  Yeah, and Joe, you cracked me up the entire time.  Hey, does...  Did she say Joe?  Joe cracked her up the entire time?  Who cracked you up, Amanda?  Yeah, Jeff.  Jeff?  Jeff?  Who's Jeff?  Oh, man, she didn't say that movie.  Joe, Jeff, Jeff.  Joe, Jeff.  I'm excited.  Okay.  Joe, Jeff, can you name one scene, one thing that happened in the movie?  Yeah, let's say it is.  One thing that happened in the movie?  Yeah. 
[02:06:00]  That emissions building got set on fire.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you saw that.  All right.  What about a part that's not in the commercials?  I got a question.  Who was the fireman?  This is a good quiz.  Yeah, who played the fireman?  Vince Diller.  Yeah, you saw that.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, a little secret cameo.  Amanda?  It's out of the bag.  Does Colin make it into the college?  Wait, I'll even dump that.  But then he dies.  But then he makes a sad ending.  I got to bring this up.  Look how we've never had this many girls call this guy's name. 
[02:06:30]  Really?  Colin's so cute.  You get that everywhere, right?  No.  Well, no, not really.  No.  You don't?  Dude, okay, here's the deal.  They're all, like, you know, 14.  Yeah.  How old are you?  24.  24?  Yeah.  You got a chick?  What am I going to do?  No.  No?  Really?  No.  Play in the field kind of thing?  I've been too busy to be in the...  Are you banging Hollywood's daughters or what?  You're going out like Russell Crowe and getting everything in sight? 
[02:07:00]  No, no, no.  God damn.  Jill, what's up?  Hi.  I'm a big fan of Colin's and I'm actually over 14.  Oh, how old are you?  I'm 29.  There you go.  Yeah.  Nice.  Big fan of Roswell.  Thanks.  And he was my favorite character on the show.  Thanks, dude.  And, uh...  Did you just call him a dude?  Yeah, I did.  God damn it.  That's right, Roswell.  Dude, do that.  And I've been following his work since then.  I think he's a great actor.  Thanks.  We didn't think you were going to listen to us.  He is hot.  What do you say instead of dude when it's a... 
[02:07:30]  Thanks, babe.  Babe.  Chick.  Everybody's a dude.  Honey.  All right, Jill.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jim.  Thanks, Heidi.  Uh, Heather.  Yes, this is Heather.  Hey.  I wanted to tell Jack thank you very much for bringing some romance into my marriage because...  Oh, really?  My husband, who is probably driving home right now from Indiana...  He was doing it too hard?  What?  He was doing it too hard?  Well, yes, and he happened to listen to your song.  And the one for the ladies.  Yeah.  And, um, he calls me one day on his cell phone. 
[02:08:00]  He says, honey, my kielbasa sausage, um, has just got to perform.  Wait a second.  So, I totally renovated your love life with my music?  Oh, definitely.  Oh, that's...  That's great to hear.  When we're done with the hot love making, he's like, that's freaking teamwork.  Oh, man.  Makes it worth it, Jack.  That's weird.  That's what it's all about.  You quote the album during and after sex?  Yep.  That's awesome.  Teetering on sick.  You are our hero.  Man, have you seen us live before?  Um, well, we've seen a couple movies, and he's, um... 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  I know he watched you on, I think, one of the late night shows this past week or so.  Yeah.  But, um...  You've got to come see the D live to get the full...  Well, you were in Cleveland not too long ago, but...  Yeah.  I happened to work night, so I missed you.  Oh.  All right.  Heather, next time, right?  Definitely next time.  We'll catch you next time.  Thanks for calling.  Oh, you're welcome.  All right.  Jeff has a...  Thanks for boning.  A lot of people had problems with the show.  In our honor.  Jeff, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And everybody.  Voss ain't on there, is he?  Yes, he is.  Yeah, what's up, Voss? 
[02:09:00]  You don't remember me, do you?  Who are you?  Jeff Collins.  Newark.  From where?  I've done...  I'm a comedian.  What is this, Voss?  Your paging service?  No.  No, trust me.  I'm not calling to say what's up to Voss.  So what's going on, Jeff?  No, how come you don't have any black comedians on there?  You have one right next to me.  He's not funny.  You picked a hell out of them.  I'm a real comedian.  Oh, yeah.  Patrice ain't funny, right?  Patrice is killing today.  He's funny on the show.  That's about it.  Not on stage.  Oh, man.  That's you.  Oh, what did I...  He gave a wrong name. 
[02:09:30]  Whoever this is, we know who it is, but he gave a wrong name.  Say your real name.  My name's Jeff.  Jeff who?  Jeff Collins.  Where do you work?  What club?  You're not a comic.  No one knows Jeff Collins.  You're saying I'm not a comic?  Shut up.  No.  I don't even know...  Shut up.  What club you work for?  Name one club you work for.  Not one you...  You know what?  Comics are so petty, man.  Yes, we are.  He called just to say...  I understand.  You guys get all, like, nippy with each other.  Yes, we do.  Jeff Collins.  No one's heard of Jeff Collins. 
[02:10:00]  No one's heard of Patrice either.  Yes, they have, stupid.  Now.  I haven't.  You said you saw me already.  You know what?  This is somebody like...  I said I saw Vaughn.  You're a jackass.  I said I saw Vaughn.  I worked with Vaughn.  Jeff, are you a black comic?  You worked with me where?  Were you doing the fries?  Where?  Because I'm funny.  Now you're funny, Vaughn.  No, where did you work with me?  For real?  It was one time in Newark and one time in Jersey.  He's lying.  He's lying.  Because Newark is in Jersey, stupid.  No, I'm not.  I can even...  I remember what you were wearing.  You were wearing a black jacket. 
[02:10:30]  You were at Klondike Cates on Main Street.  Go back to work, you open Micah.  You bring a shut up.  You got a day job.  You're awesome.  Thank you, Jeff.  Who was he?  Jesus, man.  I don't know.  Comics.  Marie, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I'm on?  Yeah.  Oh, Colin is there?  Yeah.  Oh, God, I love you.  Oh, I have such a thing for you.  Thank you.  You are so gorgeous.  I used to watch Roswell every week just to see you and those pretty blue eyes.  I have green eyes.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to know. 
[02:11:00]  Get the color on your TV for that.  I want to know why you left Roswell.  Why did you leave?  Because they killed me.  I mean, that was stupid, though.  I mean, what was that all about?  Maybe everyone dies in that show.  They all come back.  And I've come back.  Yeah, the ghost.  I've come back on a...  Yeah.  But once in a while.  Once in a while.  Yeah.  So?  You know.  Marie, 22 years old and you want to do Colin?  Oh, totally.  But I'm like stuck in Bergen County now.  Bergen County?  Bergen County.  Bergen.  Totally.  Like all on in my house. 
[02:11:30]  Well, thank you for your kind words.  We're going to move on to the next girl that's in love with Colin.  Thank you, Marie.  Let me go to Kate.  Kate, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  I'm not 14 anyway, so.  And I'm not in love with anyone.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys that I am very psyched to see this movie.  I'm going, I think, tonight.  Cool.  Orange County.  You will enjoy.  Thank you.  I predict you will enjoy.  I hope so.  I hope so.  Thank you.  I'm actually looking very forward to it.  Awesome.  Why doesn't anyone adore Jack Black?  I do.  I love him.  Oh, okay. 
[02:12:00]  Dude, he's saving people's sex lives.  Yeah.  Didn't you hear that?  That's true.  What are you talking about?  That's true.  I'm not one to worry about right now, maybe.  All right, Kate.  Thank you.  Thanks.  You were in the Band of Brothers, Colin?  Yeah.  A little bit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I missed that.  No, I saw Band of Brothers, but I missed your part in there.  Yeah.  You know, after they were in Bastogne, those two snow episodes, I was the one after that.  That was a great series.  It was awesome, right?  Yeah.  And working with your dad on that one?  Dude, it was strange. 
[02:12:30]  The guy who directed the episode I was in, he cast me and got the approval from my dad  and everybody, but he didn't really like ... He was back in Los Angeles, and we filmed  that in London, so it's almost like I wasn't even working with him.  Oh, really?  He was like the big guy that everyone knew, but it didn't even seem like I was working  with him at all.  Yeah.  So everyone's like, what was it like?  I'm like, well, anticlimactic.  Because I didn't even see him, you know? 
[02:13:00]  And then that thing you do, right?  Yeah, dude.  Oh, you were in that?  Yeah, but here's the thing, dude.  Internet Movie Database, wrong.  Oh, dude.  It's so wrong.  It's so wrong.  I'm in one shot.  See?  They're amazing.  I'm in one shot, and like on the box of the Cisco movie, they have that as like my big  credit, even though I'm only in it for like two seconds.  It's ridiculous, dude.  When I was on, the first time I was on Leno, they're like, okay, well, you know, we want  to talk about, you know, how you're only in that thing you do for one shot. 
[02:13:30]  I said, okay.  It's like 30, it's like literally about three seconds.  It cost them $3,000 to show.  I'm like, it's not worth that much money.  Not worth that much money.  All right.  That's funny.  Rachel, uh, Rachel.  Yeah, hey.  Here we go.  I think Jack is incredibly sexy.  Oh.  Oh, there we go.  Give me a second.  The entire end of High Fidelity when he's singing, when you're singing, outstanding, man. 
[02:14:00]  That did something for you?  It did a lot for me, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  You're a sucker for the singing, dude.  Well, thank you.  Oh, no, thank you.  Keep it up because I, you know, between the humor and, you know, the sort of wacky sexual  and the good voice.  I don't know.  Wacky.  There's a compliment in there somewhere.  It's a very good thing.  Cool.  All right.  All right, Rachel.  Are you down with the D?  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  I actually got the album right when it came out and it's really good. 
[02:14:30]  You've got an amazing voice.  Wait a second.  You're turning into a robot.  Did you hear that?  Her voice started to go robotronic.  That's cell phone crap.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Okay.  Thanks, Rachel.  And Eric has something to say.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, Jack, weren't you the guy that was flying the airplane in Waterworld?  That's true.  How'd you figure that out?  I'm covered with grease.  Yeah, I sort of looked at you and recognized you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm in that.  Did you make X-Files episode with that lightning kid? 
[02:15:00]  That's me as well.  Yeah, that was a sick episode.  Yeah.  And Colin, he got shot by the band of brothers and just got left there.  Yeah.  No.  No.  I'm a big fan of black in there.  No.  I'll say no to that one.  No.  You're a lieutenant in that, huh?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Run, run.  What the hell was that?  Some video game noise.  It turned in like 50s sci-fi.  You know who I think was definitely miscast in a band of brothers? 
[02:15:30]  Jimmy Fallon.  Yeah.  When Jimmy Fallon comes driving up in the gym and goes, hey, hey, guys, I got the ammo.  I'm like waiting for a weekend update moment.  Like it took me out of the friggin' series in a second.  A little bit, yeah.  I should go, ah, who's pal got Jimmy Fallon in this?  I don't know.  He's a really nice guy, though.  I don't doubt that.  But it was a little...  Pulling up with his Jimmy Fallon hair.  Hey, guys, I got the ammo.  It's Jimmy Fallon bringing the ammo.  I know these guys aren't getting hurt. 
[02:16:00]  Jimmy Fallon traveled back in time.  Yeah.  He's back in World War II bringing the ammo.  To help the war car.  It's not easy for the comedian to make the transition.  I don't doubt it is, but look at you.  Well, I haven't done really any dramas, really.  He's testing the waters, Jimmy.  Dude, what about...  You know who did it?  The fat guy from The Honeymooners in the gambling movie.  God, I can't think of anything.  Oh, Jackie Gleason.  Yeah, Jackie Gleason and...  You're going old school.  Yeah.  He did it good, though.  You know what I'm saying?  Very dramatic.  Minnesota fats. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  You want to meet the virgin?  Yeah, let's bring her in.  What do you think that story's about?  Go ahead, Ant.  We have a little Valentine's Day event we're holding here, and we're taking girls now for it.  Yeah.  We're looking for girls that have remained virgin up until now.

If it's in a limo, if it's in the backseat of a car, we'll supply the car. 
[02:17:00]  We'll make it the perfect way to lose your virginity.  And here's one of the girls that want to do it.  Wow.  Hey.  She is cute.  How are you doing?  She's 19.  The 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  Are you the one that we learned you're still a virgin, but you gave up the stumper?  Yeah.  She gave up the back door to remain a virgin.  Defeats the purpose, doesn't it?  Wow. 
[02:17:30]  That's okay.  That saves something for married.  Still pure.  That's all right.  I love that.  That's good.  You get married, and then your husband goes, hey, I got me a pure girl.  Yeah, I was a virgin.  I know you were.  It's wonderful.  Oh, but I did give up the back door.  What?  That's okay.  So where are we at?  I don't know where he is.  He's supposed to be out here listening somewhere.  Can you believe our boyfriend isn't here?  Your boyfriend?  Wait, so it's a specific guy.  Yeah, yeah.  We're not just going to, you know, Patrice, go get her kind of thing.  You know?  I've been with him for two years, but he's like, I don't know. 
[02:18:00]  He thinks I'm crazy because I want to bring him here.  Wait, you've been going out with him two years, and he hasn't done?  No.  You do other things, though, right?  Yeah.  Who doesn't want to do it?  You guys have been going out for a while?  For two years.  For two years.  And this man is your existence completely?  Yeah.  Starry-eyed when you see him?  Yeah.  Yeah?  So it's the right guy.  So it's legit, then?  Yeah.  All right, that's cool.  Yeah.  You guys did one more dirty thing I was going to walk out.  You weren't going to agree if we were just, like, spin a wheel, and whatever guy it lands on gets to plow the virgin? 
[02:18:30]  No.  No.  That would be wrong.  No, this is something.  It's about Valentine's Day and love.  That's very sweet.  Yeah.  So basically, you're just going to set him up.  Right.  Right.  We're going to, you know, if the girl determined this is when she wants to do it and this is who she wants to do it with, we will make it the perfect event for you.  So you're, so...  Yeah, he comes.  They're coming, and you're sort of interviewing them, and then you guys pick who you think should win this contest. 
[02:19:00]  No, they all go.  We don't care.  Bring on the virgin.  Exactly.  It's going to be a deflowering marathon.  Oh, so you're going to hook up a bunch of people.  Yeah, as many as we can get.  Oh, I, oh, okay, cool.  She was thinking that you're going to, you're going to ask them all, like, how it was and stuff?  Yeah, we'll talk about how it was, how they feel physically, psychologically about the whole thing.  She was thinking of doing it on Ikea furniture.  The ladies don't really like it the first time, for the most part.  That's what I've...  Who cares?  Okay?  Hey, let me tell you. 
[02:19:30]  It's like, oh, get out!  No, I'm kidding.  It's not always like that.  So she's ready to go today, but the boyfriend is saying...  Yeah, the boyfriend isn't around, right?  Boy, that's odd.  A 19-year-old virgin girlfriend.  I'm crazy, because I want to bring him here.  Well, you're just brought here to kind of chat, and then you go off and do what you do.  That's all.  Wait, they can do it today, though?  They could have.  She's ready.  Yeah, but now, you know, we're looking at an hour left on the show.  I'll do it with you.  I promise it won't hurt.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, of course it won't. 
[02:20:00]  Patricia's shaking his head again.  Wasn't that funny, Voss?  Wasn't that funny?  Colin's right in on it.  Right in on the Voss bashing, Colin.  Welcome to the family.  Sorry, man.  You set me up there.  I'm sorry.  I never did a Cisco movie.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you didn't get the part.  Have you done a movie?  No.  No.  Wow.  Classy. 
[02:20:30]  Bastard.  Man.  It's okay.  You're doing fine in your career.  I'm doing very fine.  Ask her, is her father alive?  Oh, no, huh?  Well, yeah.  Is her father still alive?  Yeah, Colin, you want to ask her about any deaths in the family?  Is your dad still alive?  Yeah.  Sweet.  Does he listen to the show?  No.  Sometimes.  Actually, he does, but he listens to the show in Florida.  I hope that you guys don't have the show in Florida.  Not yet.  Okay, guys.  Working on it.  So, I'm glad he's not listening to it.  Yeah, that's good.  He doesn't know his name.  Oh, could this be your boyfriend?  Yeah.  Usually, we don't like calls happening here, but take that call, please, right now. 
[02:21:00]  Beeper.  No, it wasn't him.  Who is it?  911.  911.  One of your friends.  Do you know you're on the radio?  Yeah, great.  Thanks.  It sounds like your boyfriend's a little nervous about it.  He's a little scared about the event, so to speak.  I don't know.  I know he's not a virgin, but I don't know.  Does he have a cell phone?  Yeah.  Can we get him on the line?  Do you know his number?  Yeah.  Give Rick the cell phone number.  Rick is going to call him, and we've got to work this out.  We just want to see what he's all about.  I would be pretty freaked if I was your boyfriend. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you know something?  To be quite honest, dude, I would be pretty freaked out as well.  You know what, though, Colin?  It's a chance to deflower your girlfriend.  He's been trying for two years.  I wouldn't care what the circumstance is.  If she says go, oof, go.  Have you ever deflowered someone?  Yeah, don't even lie.  What?  You know you have.  I never have.  You haven't?  No.  I've never been anyone's first.  No?  No.  Are you lying?  No, I'm not.  I don't think I have. 
[02:22:00]  No?  You stand out in their memory.  Now it's too late.  Now it's like, what?  I'm too old to be with you.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, there is a window of opportunity there that kind of closes down as the years go on.  You don't want to be the first at like 35 or something.  You're like, hey, what are you?  I'll pick you up from school and...  She let him kiss me.  Don't say that.  All right, Patrice.  I'm not good.  No, that's okay.  That's all right, dude.  Don't worry about it.  We got systems in place.  I know.  You'll figure it all out.  It's fun to... 
[02:22:30]  It's just when you put those words together.  The new guys make these mistakes.  Exactly.  It's all in the context, Joe.  John, what's up?  Real fast.  Yo, big fan of Jack.  Yo, I want to see if you want to bless this blunt with me one day.  One of these days.  Possibly.  Yo, let me know.  And the next question is, are you coming up with another movie?  No.  Well, we're trying to write a Tenacious D movie right now.  And you should look for that in sometime 2005.  I don't know.  Yo, where can I see you at? 
[02:23:00]  You can see Tenacious D.  We're playing Roseland on the 22nd on Tuesday.  We.  New York, that is.  All right, John.  All right.  Later, guys.  Peace.  I was the businessman thug.  Rick.  Businessman thug.  Yo.  Yo.  Where will I see you again?  Where will I see you again?  Did Rick get your boyfriend's number?  He's calling right now.  He's calling?  Is that him?  He's on slow. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  Nice.  What's his name?  Jason.  Jason.  Jason.  Hello?  What's up, man?  Who is this?  It's Opie and Anthony along with your girlfriend.  Nicole.  Yeah.  Why don't you go here?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Hey, dude.  Dude.  What?  Who?  Opie?  Anthony?  Yeah.  What's up?  You got my girlfriend in the studio?  Yeah.  Listen up, man.  Yeah.  She wants to lose her virginity to you.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  And we want to hook you guys up.  Okay.  I think I can do that on my own.  No, you can't.  Dude, you invested two years.  You couldn't close the deal.  We're doing it for you here in minutes.  In minutes?  Minutes.  Wait.  This is not cool.  This is not cool.  Dude, we'll get you a hotel room.  Yeah, we're not saying you're going to do it in front of everyone.  No, you're not doing it in front of anybody.  You're going to be alone.  I'm going to do it enough to go there.  Why?  Nicole, is Doug with you?  Ah, pull set.  Yeah, Dougie, her friend.  Get the...  Wait a minute. 
[02:24:30]  Hey, Jason, you must be happy about Dougie.  Dougie's around with her all the time.  Dougie day?  Hey, Dougie, come in here.  Get Dougie in here.  What the hell?  This is a friend of hers.  A good friend.  Dougie.  Yeah, I know him.  Dougie looks good, too.  Look at Dougie.  Dougie.  Dougie looks muscular, yeah.  Like Billy Zane.  And he's moving his hips back and forth.  Dougie's moving his hips around.  Yeah, Doug.  Hey, Jason.  Get away from her, Doug.  Hey, I'm not doing...  Hey, she wanted to come out here, so I bought her, you know, right?  You want to come out here?  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:25:00]  Doug is pulsating.  Hey, Jason, how you feel about her being friends with Dougie?  I'm pretty sick of it.  I'm pretty sick of it.  Why are you sick of it?  It's pretty much the end of the story right now.  Why don't you come down here to the studio, man?  This is it.  This is it.  You got 50 minutes.  You can do it.  Come down here.  Oh, yeah.  Dougie, I want to talk to you, first of all.  Let it be in style.  Why did you go with him out there to the city in the first place?  He's my best friend.  I told you not to go.  I told you not to go out there.  He's my best friend.  What's the big deal anyway?  Did he tell you?  You know that I want you. 
[02:25:30]  I told you yesterday.  You knew the whole thing.  I don't know why you're trying to back out of now.  Why can't we just do this?  It's just me and you in private.  Why do we got to do this over the whole...  It's not like they're going to watch you or anything.  Dougie's going to smash it.  I mean, I should be more scared than you.  Dougie's going to smash it.  I'm feeling Doug.  Hear this sound?  Look at Doug all smooth over there.  That's her booty.  Look, look, look.  Oh.  That's what Patrine said.  He goes, it looks like Billy Zane or something.  Yeah.  Colin, yeah.  Oh, Colin said that?  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Nicole.  Nicole.  What?  Nicole.  Come over here.  Baby.  You're finished.  Why did you go out there?  Because I don't want to move up with anything on the show.  Didn't we talk about this?  Exactly.  First you were with it, and now you're backing out.  Because I love you, baby.  I love you, baby.  I don't want to do this.  I don't want to do it just me and you.  Why can't you just do it over here?  It's going to be me and you anyway.  I mean.  Hey, dude, you weren't going to close the deal without us anyway. 
[02:26:30]  I'm going to close this deal.  Hey, was he going to close the deal unless we had brought this up?  Probably not.  Probably not.  Dude, you owe us.  Get your ass down here and F-R.  She's a cute young thing.  Jay, Jay, Jay.  What better way to do it than with ONA participating?  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah.  That's coming from Dougie.  Hey, come on down here.  Come on down here.  Come on.  Brooklyn Diner.  Dougie.  Babe.  Oh, man.  You guys got me off guard, man. 
[02:27:00]  It's a free hotel room.  Hey, bro.  Hey, Jason.  Come over here, baby.  You weren't going to do it in front of everyone.  I mean, if you guys wanted a hotel, we were going to hook that up.  Whatever.  We'll hook you up.  Whatever you want, man.  What do you think?  Nicole.  What do you think?  Nicole.  We've been going out for two years.  There's no reason for this.  There's no reason for this.  There's no reason for what?  I want to lose my virginity to you.  Don't you want to be special?  Just me and you with some candles? 
[02:27:30]  It is going to be special.  That's why I want to do it with you.  Why do you have to broadcast it?  Why do you have to broadcast it all over the East Coast?  Exactly.  Hey, it's not just the East Coast.  It's 18 cities.  That's it.  Opie, Anthony, you guys suck.  Nicole, you embarrass me, man.  Oh, man.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Nicole sucks, too.  Jason.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, Dougie, that sounded like they're broken up to me.  Hey, I'm her best friend, and if she needs a shoulder to cry on, I'm just going to cry. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah, Dougie!  Yeah, he pulls her clothes.  You guys suck, man.  I'll give her the kiss on the forehead.  Guys are pigs.  That's it.  There you go.  Well, try to go smooth things over, Nicole, and maybe we can make this happen next week.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll try.  I think we can turn this guy around, Anthony.  Yeah, he seems...  He wants it to be special.  We could do that for you guys.  He doesn't understand the concept.  He doesn't feel special, not him.  He doesn't understand the concept.  He thinks it's us, you know, going to be in the room, and it's going to be a microphone on it. 
[02:28:30]  No.  We'll get the hotel.  We'll get the candles.  We'll get the music.  Right.  We'll get Tenacious D to play in the corner.  Yeah, it's good after music.  Just keep boss's takes away, man.  Yeah.  You want to stay away with them takes, man.  Everyone loves boss.  I got drivers coming at me now.  How old's your boyfriend?  20.  20, oh.  All right.  I think the boyfriend's feeling too much pressure.  Do you think that's what it is?  I think that's what's going on.  He wants to.  God forbid he can't perform.  Yeah, but now that it's been such a big deal, now he's freaking out. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  That's what I think is what's going on.  And apparently, he's not very happy with it right now.  Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.  You know?  My final thoughts after this.  That's what it sounded like, a frigging Springer episode with you two.  Nicole, give us an update on Monday, all right?  I hope you smooth things over.  He doesn't have, like, a premature problem or anything.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I mean, if they're one of those things.  Oh, that's it.  No, he doesn't.  Salt in the wound there, Keith.  I'm just asking.  No, he doesn't.  Okay.  He does all right, right?  Yeah, he's pretty cool.  All right. 
[02:29:30]  There you go.  We should break.  We got to get these guys out of here.  The big movie stars.  Guys, we're big movie stars.  Jack Black and Colin Hanks.  That's right.  Of course you guys are.  Orange County, man.  Go check him out.  Thanks for having us.  Best of luck.  They're going to spend the whole weekend looking over the grosses, ain't you?  That's true.  There you go, man.  Colin?  I don't care about the numbers, man.  I think you guys are going to do fine, man.  I really do.  I know Jack Black will be back.  And you better stop by when Tenacious D plays in a couple weeks.  Absolutely.  All right.  And, Colin, will you come back and see us with a broken microphone now?  If you fix the mic, dude.  Yeah, dude.  I'll come back. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, stop back when you're in town, man.  I will.  Most definitely, dude.  You're all right, man.  I like it.  This was fun, man.  It's cash.  It's just hanging.  It's kind of crazy, but I dig it.  Good luck with the Virgin Contest.  Yeah.  Thank you.  This was our third attempt, and so far we're 0 for 3.  We had a slutty virgin from Cleveland.  It looks like she backed out.  A fireman was going to bang her.  We had a big fat girl that was also what they call a cutter.  Huh?  A slutty virgin?  That seems like an oxymoron, doesn't it?  But they do exist.  But she explained it, and it made sense, Jack.  Oh, I see. 
[02:30:30]  It made sense.  Oh, she called herself a slutty virgin.  Yeah.  She does just about everything else.  Does just about everything.  And she was going to come down here, and we were going to line up a bunch of New York City firemen,  and she would pick who she would want.  And the guy was going to do it for her.  Oh.  Yeah.  But it looks like she's getting cold feet.  Right.  And then we had the psychotic, fat, crazy cutter virgin.  She cuts herself.  Ooh.  Yeah.  She was a cutter.  Yeah.  You know, like those after-school specialties.  That worked at a pet store.  And we were going to have her done Tuesday for her 18th birthday. 
[02:31:00]  And she called with a screaming father in the background.  Of course.  That was pretty much the end of that one.  So, you know, we're trying here.  We got some time.  It's a really happy show you guys got here.  Hey, at least we're not bringing up death tattoos, Colin.  Dude, it was not a death tattoo.  You turned that statement.  It said tat.  I thought maybe she was a fan of the group, you know.  Out of an up-tempo number into a goddamn death tattoo.  Dude, I just wanted to know what the tattoo was for.  I didn't know it was a death tattoo.  I know.  Innocent mistake. 
[02:31:30]  It was a death tattoo.  You guys suck.  All right.  Go see Orange County.  It's Colin Hanks and, of course, Jack Black.  Yes.  Take it easy.  Opie Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  Effing Honduras.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Why'd you leave the keys up on the table, Davis?  Yeah, yeah.  That rocks.  Those guys were cool, huh?  Jack Black we already knew was cool. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  But who would think that Tom Hanks' son would be as cool as he was?  Colin Hanks.  You know, anybody that could sit in here and goof on Voss can't be all that bad a guy.  It was so cool to see that develop because, you know, we're abusing you like we usually do.  And Jack Black's like, I don't get it.  A lot of inside jokes.  And Colin's like, what's going on in here?  By the end, they're like, oh, we get it.  They're jumping right on the pile.  They're jumping right in.  Anthony, this is off the AP.  Oh, so it's got to be true. 
[02:32:30]  Got to be true.  And it's in parentheses, AP.  Tom Hanks, this own son.  More news to come.  Matt, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up with this girl from Cleveland?  The slutty virgin from Cleveland may be backing out.  We can't get her back on the phone.  I was looking forward to breaking her in.  Yeah, it's not very patriotic, her backing out, right?  I don't know.  We better get her on the phone and do something about this.  Are you the Irish fireman?  No, I'm the other one from Queens.  I was sitting on the license.  Oh, you were the backup.  Yeah.  You were the backup. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I was going to slip in there and kind of break her in.  You know, we've got to be honest.  We don't know if the slutty virgin is going to be coming to New York from Cleveland.  Hey, you know, we could, he was the backup guy?  Yeah, he was the backup guy.  He was the primary guy and the backup guy.  Girls like fire hydrants have a couple of outlets there that you could have hooked right  on to my fireman friend.  This is the worst.  Eventually, this bit will work or whatever you want to call it.  Yeah.  Now, today's problem is we've got the girl more than willing.  Who thought you'd see this happen?  She's here and her boyfriend is like, no way, no way, no way. 
[02:33:30]  You never see a guy back out.  That's not right.  It's ridiculous.  I'm shaky with him.  He might be a little fishy.  The guy wants to make it special and we were going to make it special.  How much do you want to bet Dougie Nelsar?  How much do you want to bet?  He's crazy.  I don't know.  Did you see like when they were on the phone and stuff and after Jason, the boyfriend,  hung up, Dougie's like, you all right, man?  You okay?  He's like, got the hands on her hair.  Dude, you're going to kill Jason.  He's listening to this.  Then he like, I don't need to hear this.  He takes her head and puts it on her shoulder and stuff. 
[02:34:00]  I'll slip in there.  And she grabbed her hand and placed it on his junk and I'm teasing on that part.  I don't know what happened there, but that's something though.  But you would think with something going on like there's not really a contest, but just  an event, that it would be the guy, the girl that we'd have problems getting.  Right.  He got the girl.  He got the guy, but he doesn't want to do this.  It would have been a successful little thing that we came up with.  I'll handle it for him.  All right, Matt.  Well, if the slutty virgin calls back, you know, we'll get a hold of you, I guess. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Thanks a lot, boys.  All I know is if I was 20 years old like that guy and a 19-year-old virgin girl wants to  have sex with me.  What?  Macy's window?  Fine.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Don't matter to me.  Lady Di.  Oh, God.  Lady Di.  Hello?  All right, she's gone.  How are you?  Oh, no.  Who gave her this line?  How are you?  Lady Di.  How are you?  Oh, shut up.  She can't even do it right. 
[02:35:00]  How are you?  Hey, you drunk.  How are you doing?  Hey, hey, hey.  Stop it, Anthony, please.  You sound hammered right now.  Anthony!  You're drunk right now.  What?  You disgust me.  What?  Listen to her.  You're drunk.  Rick says she's close to tears.  No, I am not drunk.  Lady Di, you're drunk.  No, I am not.  And you're annoying.  We had a gig down at Bar 9.  You know Bar 9?  Yeah.  Down on 9th.  Yeah.  And they're my brothers there, so we're getting up on stage. 
[02:35:30]  We're playing some music and stuff.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, Anthony, stop.  And Lady Di gets up on the stage and becomes the most annoying twat.  She's drunk and she's singing.  Stop it right now.  She wouldn't shut up.  See this?  This is what I heard all night.  Stop it right now.  And she's drunk again.  She's crying, Anthony.  She doesn't have to go upstairs.  Anthony, please.  Stop it right now.  You're hammered.  She's crying.  I am not hammered.  Stop your whining.  The midget's crying.  Private pile.  Shut up.  You disgust me.  Anthony, this is not right.  She's crying.  Oh, shut up. 
[02:36:00]  The midget's more together than her.  Anthony, Opie, Opie, save me, please.  Opie, Opie, Opie, save me, please.  Too late.  Opie, save me, please.  You couldn't get Greenpeace to save you.  It's hard.  The lady's crying, Anthony.  Hey, what's the matter?  This is not...  Hey, did you hear that good line, Voss just said?  That was Voss.  By the way, I have to say one thing right now.  We'll take the bottle away from you, man.  Tom Hanks, son.  Yeah.  I loved him in the movie, That Thing You Do.  That is my favorite movie.  The one he said he was in for 30 seconds.  No, for two seconds.  It was two seconds.  It was two seconds, right.  That Thing You Do is my favorite movie. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, how about That Thing You Do, Drink and Be Annoying?  Why are you crying?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  Why are you crying?  There's somebody in the toilet here.  What's the matter?  How's that divorce working out for you?  Tom Hanks, son.  Hey, how's that divorce working out for you, Lady Di?  Divorce is done.  Yeah, I know.  So how is it being divorced now and having no prospects?  Oh, man.  There was nothing happening with my divorce right now.  This is like a scene from Days of Wine and Roses.  Shut up. 
[02:37:00]  What made you open up that bottle today?  What made me open up that bottle today was the divorce is final.  That's it.  Yeah, wasn't it final for a month?  Over a month ago you said it was final.  Boy, you're really going to hook up with someone good, drunk all the time.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Where's your pal Fryer?  Marion is going to call up in a little while.  You know what?  Even Marion is going to dump you.  You know, I had a newfound respect for Marion the night at Bar 9.  Oh, shut up, Anthony.  She was the one telling you to shut up, knock it off, and get off the stage, and you kept at it like a goddamn hen. 
[02:37:30]  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, shut up.  You're annoying.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, listen to me.  That's what I heard.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  Anthony, listen to me.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, I am sorry about that.  You're an annoying drunk.  You're an annoying drunk.  6.30 and you're drunk.  What's wrong?  Listen to you.  I could be an annoying drunk, but it will not happen again.  It's 6.30 and you're smashed. 
[02:38:00]  Look at yourself.  It was 6.30?  Look at yourself.  It is 6.30 and you're smashed.  No, it was not.  It was 9.30, Anthony.  I'm talking about right now, you stupid twat.  Well, I'm home right now.  Yeah, and when did you start drinking?  Oh, two hours ago.  And who's there drinking with you?  Nobody.  Oh, no problem there.  No problem.  There you go.  Opie, Opie, save me.  Opie, save me.  Just sitting there, Opie, feeding that ass with some hops and barley. 
[02:38:30]  Shut up, Anthony.  Ah, you shut up.  So, hey, have the cops ever been to your house?  No.  There's a cop on the line that says he has.  No.  How about the dog cat?  Well, have they?  No.  No one's getting any of these.  I'm telling you.  They're laughing out there.  What?  What?  What's supposed to be 16?  How long were you married for?  Seven years.  He got the seven-year itch, right?  Seven-year itch. 
[02:39:00]  We did have a seven-year itch.  Yes, we did.  Sentence for that guy.  He had a seven-year itch.  Seven years.  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing me.  He couldn't get on after four with good behavior?  Why are you...  What?  That was good.  Why are you calling?  You guys are killing me.  Why are you calling today?  I decided to call you guys to say Happy New Year.  I decided to call you guys.  Don't you realize...  I decided to call you guys to say Happy New Year.  Hey, hey, hey, ass monkey.  Don't you realize you called already to wish us a Happy New Year last time you were drunk? 
[02:39:30]  Stop it.  Do you remember last time when maybe you were blacked out that you called up already to  wish us a Happy New Year and we lambasted you for being drunk and ruining some of Joe's  songs?  The thing about the snowman.  The thing about the snowman.  Oh, when you were sucking the snowman's carrot nose in the bar.  Yes, I know about that.  A ten is drunk as aggravating.  You're a one and a half.  Shut up, Rich.  You're a one and a half and that's your wallet, okay?  Rich, boss, shut up.  Please.  The thing about the snowman. 
[02:40:00]  Now you know why these guys are cruising Christopher Street.  I don't know.  Your husband, right?  Do you picture her husband like...  I know, really.  I picture him in the back of a convertible car smoking a big cigar with music playing.  And I'm very happy my husband does not want to do this show.  Listen, this is what she was doing all night.  Picture that all effing night.  We're on stage trying to perform and she's yelling.  I feel bad.  She seems pretty lonely right now.  I understand what I did that night.  Then go over to her house, pull it down and eff her, Opie.  She seems lonely and sad. 
[02:40:30]  Anthony, I told you before I understand what I did that night.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Then why are you doing it again?  I'm not going to do it again.  You are doing it again.  I'm not going to fucking do it again.  Do you understand that?  Don't you realize you have a problem, Lady Di?  A problem with what?  Don't you realize you have a drinking problem and maybe some mental problems that you ought  to have taken care of?  I think maybe you have to focus on yourself a little. 
[02:41:00]  I forgot to throw in weight.  I have to understand something right now.  I think you swallowed a lot of aggression along with a lot of pepperoni pizzas.  Excuse me.  Remember, that's right.  Excuse me along the line over here.  Anthony, I will make it up to you.  There's no make.  I don't give a crap.  What do you think?  I care about your stupid life?  Hey.  Sorry, Opie.  All right.  Excuse me for one minute.  I only have a few lines.  Excuse me for one minute.  Yes.  Okay.  I have a bottle for you of Budweiser. 
[02:41:30]  If you want it, you can have it.  Oh, a bottle.  Wow.  Wow.  Woo-hoo.  I guess you turned two extra tricks last night.  Oh, my God.  If you want it, you can have it.  Shut up.  How are you going to make it up to Anthony with a warm bath and a razor off the building?  How are you going to make it up to him?  All right.  Make it up one way.  The boss always comes on late to the game.  How are you going to have it?  It's in the stretch.  He's in the distance runner.  Okay.  Happy home day from Budweiser.  I don't want to attack Bush and Buddy's kid over there. 
[02:42:00]  He's 24.  He's happy.  Did two movies.  Let him live in his, you know.  Shut up, Rich.  No.  Lady Di, do you honestly think Budweiser wants you offering gifts in the name of Budweiser?  No.  That's the company that I work for, and they gave that to me.  Not for much longer.  You want it.  Wait.  What's so special about this bottle of beer?  The thing that's special about it is happy holidays on the side over here.  Shut up.  It's got some cobwebs.  Shut up.  That's my new favorite sound, man. 
[02:42:30]  Does the bottle have some cobwebs on it from your beaver?  No, it does not have cobwebs for my beaver.  A bottle of beer.  I don't have cobwebs on my beaver.  Oh, please.  My beaver is very, very good.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You guys got to put lemon pledge on a cobwebs to get through that junk.  Shut up, Rich.  How the hell do you even know?  You can't see it through the bunt.  You got that bunt.  Oh, man.  You got a bunt.  I know.  I know I have a bunt.  I know.  I know I have a bunt. 
[02:43:00]  Well, take care of it.  Oh, my God.  How about a sit-up?  You guys.  Is a bunt what I think it is?  Yes.  It's a bunt.  It's not belly and it's not...  It's just a bunt.  I know what my bunt is.  It's a front...  It's a front...  It's a front ass.  A front ass.  It's like an awning over the area.  It's a ski slope for that midget down the whole way.  Exactly.  Exactly.  A stussy?  A stussy.  I know what my bunt is.  Please.  A stussy.  I like it.  No word.  No word.  I like the stussy. 
[02:43:30]  You know what I look like and you know what everybody else looks like.  Do you hear this babble?  Do you hear this babble?  Why don't you get your kitchen stapled?  You know something?  Guys, I will always love you guys no matter what.  I don't care what you call me.  I will always love you guys no matter what.  You got that?  Anthony, do you want that bottle of bud?  No, I don't want anything from you.  Why don't you just mail the 86 cents in?  Yeah.  Please.  Because I will give it to you if you want it. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, man.  No, I don't want your bottle of beer.  You don't want that bottle of beer?  Why not?  Drink it.  Forget about who you are for another second.  No, it's not a bottle of beer.  It's a bottle of, like, friggin' water.  I don't know what it is in there.  Oh, my God.  Do you hear the slurring?  Can you believe this?  You're so hammered.  I feel like I'm married again.  You're hammered.  What?  You feel like you're married again?  You're hammered, lady.  Wow.  I am not hammered.  Oh, shut up.  Put down the bottle.  What do you mean, shut up?  Wow.  Did you see me, baby, or what? 
[02:44:30]  I'm not a pile of system.  I'm not a pile of water.  Stop.  Stop.  Forget it.  Stop.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  I'm crying out loud.  We really have to take a break.  I've had enough.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Di.  Yes.  Are you going to be by Rascals tonight?  Oh.  Sorry.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I forget it.  West Orange?  I don't think so.  No.  I'm home already.  I'm home in New Jersey.  And I'm home already.  Hey, Lady Di, why don't you do the 6 o'clock quie for us?  Oh, please.  Do you want me to do that?  No.  No. 
[02:45:00]  Stop it.  Do you want me to do that?  Oh, shut up.  Please.  We'll be able to smell it over the phone.  Lady Di, what do you do for Budweiser?  Grab a bunch of friends and pull that big wagon?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Well, yeah.  Do you want me to do the Hawaii?  Hawaii?  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

[02:55:30]  Why can't she go out with me?  I'm just going to hop in the shower.  Jay, why can't she go out with me?  Why?  Because I don't trust you, Dirty Rat.  You know, I always go out with him.  Don't say that.  You know I'm not like that.  She's my best friend.  I would never.  Best friend.  Best friend.  Best friend.  That's cute.  No such thing.  All right, listen, Jason.
